Abstract

Author Manuscript

Post-translational acetylation of lysines is most extensively studied in histones, but this
modification is also found in many other proteins and is implicated in a wide range of biological
processes in both the cell nucleus and the cytoplasm. Like phosphorylation, acetylation patterns
and levels are often altered in cancer, therefore small molecule inhibition of enzymes that regulate
acetylation and deacetylation offers much potential for inhibiting cancer cell growth, as does
disruption of interactions between acetylated residues and ‘reader’ proteins. For more than a
decade now, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have been investigated for their ability to
increase acetylation and promote expression of tumor suppressor genes. However, emerging
evidence suggests that acetylation can also promote cancer, in part by enhancing the functions of
oncogenic transcription factors. In this review we focus on how acetylation of both histone and
non-histone proteins may drive cancer, and we will discuss the implications of such changes on
how patients are assigned to therapeutic agents. Finally, we will explore what the future holds in
the design of small molecule inhibitors for modulation of levels or functions of acetylation states.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

From transcriptional regulation to metabolic functions, protein acetylation is involved in
several processes that keep a cell working properly. Acetylation is a dynamic process that
involves the removal of a hydrogen atom on the episilon NH3+ side chain of lysines
followed by the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA (AcCoA). This exchange
neutralizes the positive charge on the lysine and also changes the structure of the R-group on
this amino acid, leading to various effects on the protein modified. Lysine acetylation
chemically blocks other modifications, such as methylation or ubiquitination, for example,
which can in turn increased protein stability, alter subcellular localization, or change the
spectrum of interacting proteins. As such, acetylation provides a rich regulatory ‘switch’.

Acetylation levels are regulated by a balance in the activities of acetyltransferases and
deacetylases. Although originally termed histone acetyltransferases (HATs), due to their
actions towards abundant histone substrates, lysine acetyltransferases (KATs) are located
both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm, and they have many non-histone substrates as well.
Deacetylases similarly have multiple substrates, but they are still primarily referred to as
HDACs rather than KDACs. Several excellent reviews on HDAC families and their
functions are available 1–3, so we will focus mostly on acetylation and KATs in this review.
Histone Acetylation and Chromatin Regulation

Author Manuscript

In the nucleus, DNA is packaged into chromatin. The basic unit of chromatin is the
nucleosome, which consists of 146 bp of DNA and histones, the proteins that provide the
scaffold that DNA is wrapped around. Histones contain a globular domain that promotes
histone-histone interactions within the nucleosome and also provides a binding surface for
DNA. In addition, they contain tail domains that protrude out of the nucleosome, where they
influence histone-histone interactions, interactions between histones and DNA, and between
histones and other proteins. Although both the globular domains and the tail domains can be
modified, the histone tails are particularly rich in modifications, including methylation,
acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and sumoylation. The many sites and types of
modification provide a wealth of variable combinations, which in turn provides huge
regulatory potential for remodeling chromatin states to either facilitate or inhibit gene
transcription, DNA replication, repair, or recombination.

Author Manuscript

Acetylation has long been associated with chromatin opening and active gene transcription.
Both individual nucleosomes and higher order chromatin folding can block access of RNA
polymerase and other factors to gene promoters. Acetylation affects chromatin folding as the
addition of the acetyl group neutralizes the positive charge of the lysine, weakening bonds
between histones and the negatively charged DNA backbone, as well as the bonds between
neighboring nucleosomes, allowing for more relaxed chromatin structures (Figure 1A). In
addition, acetylation at specific lysine residues on particular histones can promote binding of
regulatory factors involved in specific steps of the transcription process. For example,
Histone H3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac), catalyzed largely by Gcn5/ PCAF, 4 is enriched
at gene promoters, whereas H3K27ac, catalyzed largely by CBP/p300, is enriched at
enhancer sequences. 5 These modifications promote binding of other factors through
interactions with KAc reader domains, which are often located in other chromatin modifying
proteins, including acetyltransferases, methyltransferases, and ATP-dependent chromatin
remodelers such as Swi/Snf. 6–8

Readers of Acetyl-lysines: Bromodomains and YEATS domains
Bromodomains were the first, and until recently, the only, acetyl-lysine binding domains
described. 9,10 These domains are highly conserved across evolution and many specifically
bind acetylated lysines, while only poorly binding non-acetylated lysines, thus ‘reading’ the
acetylation status of histones or other proteins. 10 As such, bromodomains provide bridges
for histone-protein and protein-protein interactions (Figure 1C). The bromodomain family is
split into many branches, each with different structural characteristics that provide
specificity for different acetylation states or proteins. 11 Although these families have wide

Author Manuscript

variations in sequence, bromodomains contain a conserved binding site that is lined with a
loop region linking 4 α-helices, which allows for binding to acetylated lysines. The
sequence differences, variation in length of the loop region, as well as the post-translational
modifications on the residues adjacent to the acetylated lysine provide specificity for
substrate binding. 11,12 Intriguingly, many KATs themselves possess bromodomains, or are
associated into stable complexes with bromodomain containing proteins, leading to the
possibility of feed forward loops wherein they reinforce their own interactions with
chromatin or with other proteins to facilitate even more acetylation. Such KATs include
GCN5, PCAF, and CBP/p300.

Author Manuscript

Bromodomains have also been implicated in a wide range of diseases including
cancer. 13,14,15,16 For example, Santillan et al found that the HAT and bromodomain of CBP
were both important for maintenance of the cancer phenotype in leukemias caused by
translocations of the MLL gene. 17 In this case, the bromodomain promoted increased
proliferation of the leukemic cells. In another example, the Brd4 and Brd3 genes, members
of the BET bromodomain family, are fused with the gene encoding nuclear protein in testis
(NUT) in NUT midline carcinomas (NMC). 18 The resulting fusion protein, BRD-NUT,
binds to acetylated histones through the bromodomain, leading to inappropriate gene
expression 19, including expression of the oncoprotein c-Myc. 20 The translocation of IgH
and Myc common in Burkitts lymphoma and multiple myeloma causes Myc expression to
be amplified. This expression is maintained by binding of Brd4 to Igh enhancers that drives
the expression of the Igh-Myc fusion protein in these cancers. 21,22 As we will see later,
small molecule inhibitors of BET domains are showing clinical promise in a variety of Mycdriven cancers.

Author Manuscript

Interestingly, Lange et al found that the double PHD finger domain of DPF3, a member of
the BAF chromatin remodeling complex, recognizes acetylated lysines on histones H3 and
H4 as well as methylated lysines. 23,24 To date this is the only PHD domain family member
identified that recognizes acetylated lysines.

Author Manuscript

New studies have identified the YEATS domain containing proteins as another possible
family of acetyl-lysine readers. 25 In particular, the YEATS domain of the AF9 protein binds
to H3K9ac, and these interactions promote recruitment of AF9 interacting proteins to
genomic loci enriched with this modification. AF9 is part of a super elongation complex
(SEC), and it also interacts strongly with the Dot1L histone methyltransferase. Thus,
H3K9ac, which is largely mediated by Gcn5/PCAF, promotes both transcriptional
elongation and methylation of H3 at K79 by Dot1L. Although only a few YEATS domain
proteins have been analyzed for KAc binding so far, their conserved structure predicts that
many if not all will bind this modification. Like bromodomains, though, different YEATS
domains may display differential binding to specific sites of KAc. For example, the YEATS
domain in the ENL protein binds to H3K27ac with greater affinity than H3K9ac, in contrast
to the preferred binding of AF9 to H3K9ac. Interestingly, ENL is part of an alternative SEC
and H3K27ac is enriched at enhancer regions. Taken together, these findings raise the
possibility that differential sites of H3 acetylation direct different transcription related
complexes to active enhancers, promoters, or gene bodies. The importance of such
differential recruitment is highlighted by the fact that MLL-AF9 fusions lead to misdirection

of DOT1L activity and inappropriate gene expression patterns associated with
leukemogenesis. 26
Although they both bind acetyl-lysine, the structures of YEATS domains and bromodomains
are quite different. Small molecule inhibitors of YEATS domains, then, could provide a new
avenue for development of cancer therapies in the future.

KATs and Cancer

Author Manuscript

KATs are divided into families based on their structure and sequence similarity. The best
characterized include the GNAT family, which includes GCN5 and PCAF, the p300/CBP
family, and the MYST family, which includes Tip60 and Moz/Morf (Figure 2). In addition
to the histone acetyltransferase domain, KATs possess several domains that facilitate
interactions with other proteins, including reader domains for acetylation and other
modifications. Together these domains allow for specificity and diversity in KAT substrates.
Substrates of these enzymes as well as their roles in biological functions are continuing to be
defined. However, several, such as CBP/p300, have already been implicated in cancer
development and progression. 27–30
All KATs examined to date have important functions in cellular differentiation and embryo
development. 31 Since many cancers represent failures in differentiation, it is not surprising
that several KATs have also been associated with oncogenesis.
GCN5

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

GCN5 (aka GCN5L2 and KAT2A; from here on referred to as GCN5) is the evolutionarily
conserved KAT catalytic subunit of the SAGA and ATAC chromatin modifying
complexes. 8 GCN5 was first identified in yeast as a transcriptional adaptor protein, and the
Tetrahymena protein was later identified as the first HAT linked to transcriptional
regulation. 8 In isolation, Gcn5 preferentially acetylates H3K9 and H3K14, both marks of
active transcription. 4 As part of SAGA, it acetylates additional sites in H3 and also H2B.
Like most HATs, GCN5 does not bind to DNA but is recruited to chromatin by sequencespecific DNA binding transcription factors. For example, GCN5 and another component of
SAGA, TRRAP, have been linked to the Myc oncoprotein in mammalian cells. 32, 33 Myc is
the most overexpressed gene in cancer, and it is involved in transcription of genes
implicated in a wide range of cellular processes including growth, invasion, metastasis, and
apoptosis. 34 The SAGA complex is recruited to chromatin by Myc, where GCN5 acts as a
coactivator 35, creating an open chromatin conformation that allows for transcription of Myc
target genes. 36, 37, 38 Myc is also a target of GCN5 acetyltransferase activity at K323 39, and
acetylation of this site increases the stability of the Myc protein. Myc often acts in concert
with another transcription factor important in the regulation of cell growth, E2F1.
Interestingly GCN5 also interacts with E2F1 and is important for its functions in gene
regulation. For example, in small cell lung cancer, E2F1 recruits GCN5 to acetylate H3K9,
facilitating transcription of the E2F1, cyclin E, and cyclin D1 target genes 40, all of which
promote cellular proliferation and tumor growth.

Oncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 March 17.

Farria et al.

Page 5

Author Manuscript

GCN5 may also contribute to oncogenesis through modification of non-histone proteins. For
example, in many cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a translocation event fuses
E2A with the pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor 1 (PBX1). The resulting oncoprotein,
E2A-PBX1, aberrantly activates HOX contributing to the failure of differentiation of the
leukemic cells. 41 Gcn5 acetylates and stabilizes this oncoprotein in ALL cells, further
increasing target gene expression. 42 Gcn5 also interacts with tumor promoting proteins such
as Pygopus homolog 2 (Pygo2), which is a component of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.
Pygo2 directly interacts with GCN5 in the SAGA complex, bridging an interaction with
beta-catenin. 43 Pygo2 enhances the growth of breast cancer stem-like cells and its HAT
interacting domain is necessary for this function.

Author Manuscript

Gcn5 is also part of the ATAC KAT complex, which is distinct from SAGA. 44,45 Although
ATAC has not yet been implicated in cancer, it contains a YEATS domain protein,
YEATS2, which likely serves as a KAc reader. 25 ChIP-Seq data indicates that ATAC binds
to both enhancer elements and promoters, whereas SAGA preferentially binds to
promoters. 45 It will be interesting to determine if this differential distribution reflects the
differential binding of bromodomains in Gcn5 and other SAGA components and the
YEATS domain in YEATS2.
PCAF

Author Manuscript

The acetyltransferase p300/CBP associated factor, PCAF, was first described by its
competition with the oncoprotein E1A for binding to p300/CBP. 46 PCAF is a paralog of
Gcn5 that resides in a SAGA-like complex 46 and an alternative ATAC complex 44,47
mutually exclusive of Gcn5. Both Gcn5 and PCAF also directly bind to p300/CBP. 48 Gcn5
and PCAF share some redundant functions, exhibited by the necessity to knockout both
Gcn5 and PCAF in order to completely abolish H3K9 acetylation in MEFs 5; however they
also possess separate and distinct functions. 49 The phenotype of Gcn5 and PCAF knockout
mice differ, as PCAF null mice show no obvious abnormal phenotypes, but Gcn5 null
embryos die early in gestation. 50,51 PCAF was one of the first KATs shown to acetylate
non-histone proteins, namely p53. 52, 53 PCAF acetylation of p53 increases DNA binding of
p53 to its target genes. The effects on p53 as well as the ability to displace E1A indicate
PCAF might function as a tumor suppressor.

Author Manuscript

More recent data also indicates that PCAF may have an oncogenic function as well, through
acetylation of additional non-histone substrates. PCAF influences metabolic processes by
acetylating three lysines in ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), which cleaves citrate in rapidly
dividing cells to produce AcCoA, a building block for de novo lipid synthesis and an
obligate cofactor for lysine acetylation. Cancer cells preferentially utilize this alternative
method of lipid biosynthesis to build membranes and promote tumor growth. ACLY is
overexpressed in lung cancer. 54 Lin et al showed that PCAF-mediated acetylation of ACLY
stabilizes the protein by blocking lysine ubiquitination, leading to increased ACLY protein
levels, increased cell proliferation, and increased lipid biosynthesis. 54
PCAF is also involved in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, which has been implicated
in several cancers including medulloblastoma and glioblastoma. The Helin group found that
PCAF is recruited by Gli, a downstream signaling molecule in the Hh pathway, to the
Oncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 March 17.

promoters of Hh target genes. PCAF acts as a coactivator of the expression of hedgehog
target genes by acetylating H3K9. 55 Loss of PCAF also reduces the tumor promoting
activity of neural stem cells in vivo. 55 PCAF may therefore be a therapeutic target for
medulloblastoma and glioblastoma patients. PCAF was also shown to be necessary for Gli
dependent transcriptional activation in the TGFbeta pathway. 56 Additionally, PCAF is up
regulated in prostate cancer cells leading to AR transcriptional activity and cell growth. 57
PCAF has also been shown to acetylate and stabilize beta-catenin in colon cancer cells. 58
Taken together PCAF makes an attractive potential target for new cancer therapies.
CBP/p300

Author Manuscript

CBP was first identified as the coactivator of the transcription factor CREB 59, while p300
was initially identified to interact with the adenovirus transforming protein E1A. 60 These
two proteins were later found to be highly related, sharing 75% sequence similarity. 61
Deletion of CBP/p300 specifically reduces acetylation on H3K18ac and H3K27ac in
MEFs. 5 CBP/p300 also acetylate transcription factors, such as p53 62 and AR 63, thereby
inhibiting their polyubiquitination and increasing their stability. CBP/p300 are large proteins
with multiple functional domains, and they are involved in many different transcription
programs. In fact, CBP/p300 have been reported to interact with more than 400 different
cellular proteins to date 64, including factors important to cancer development and
progression such as HIF-1, beta-catenin, c-Myc, c-Myb, CREB, E1, E6, p53, AR, and ER.
Interactions between these transcription factors and CBP/p300 are crucial for efficient
transcription of their downstream target genes, in keeping with the functions of CBP/p300 as
transcriptional co-activators.

Author Manuscript

Like Gcn5 and PCAF, CBP and p300 have both shared and distinct functions. For example,
CBP and p300 control the outcomes of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in hematopoietic cells.
CBP is essential for HSC self-renewal, while p300 is required for hematopoietic
differentiation. 65 In addition, CBP activity is required for maximal HIF-2 signaling 66,
while p300 positively regulates the transactivation of HIF-1. 67 Furthermore, p300, but not
CBP, is the dominant co-regulator for androgen-regulated gene expression since 47% of
androgen-regulated genes are p300-dependent, while only 0.3% are CBP-dependent. 68
Consistent with this finding, knockdown of p300, but not CBP, leads to an increase of
caspase-dependent apoptosis in androgen-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer
cells. 69

Author Manuscript

Aberrations in both CBP and p300 show strong implications in cancer initiation and
progression. Inactivation of one allele of CBP causes Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS),
and RTS patients have an increased susceptibility for tumor development. 70 In addition,
mice heterozygous for CBP invariably develop myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative
neoplasm 71. Genetic alterations and somatic mutations/deletions of CBP/p300 are
correlated with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder 72, follicular lymphoma (41%),
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (39%) 73, relapsed ALL 74, and microsatellite
instability(MSI)-positive colon cancer cells. 75
Although many studies indicate that CBP/p300 function as tumor suppressors, other studies
indicate that CBP/p300 promote the tumor progression. Chromosomal translocations

involving MOZ or MLL fused with CBP or p300 are associated with AML through gain-offunction. 76 In addition, interaction of c-Myb with p300 is required for the induction of
AML by AML oncogenes 77,78. High CBP/p300 expression is associated with poor
prognosis in small cell lung cancer. 79 High expression of p300 was also positively
associated with higher grade, distant metastasis and later clinical stages of nasopharyngeal
carcinoma. 80 Furthermore, the subcellular localization of p300 is also associated with
cancer progression. Decreased expression of nuclear p300 and gain of cytoplasmic p300
expression are associated with disease progression and worse prognosis of melanoma
patients. 81 Moreover, CBP/p300 is implicated in resistance in certain cancer types. P300
expression is reduced in doxorubicin-resistant bladder cancer cells and knockdown of p300
leads bladder cancer cells resistant to doxorubicin. 82 However, CBP/p300 are required in
the IL-4 mediated castration resistance of prostate cancer cells. Downregulation of CBP/
p300 abolished IL-4 mediated AR activation. 83 Overall, the changes in genetic alterations,
expression level, and subcellular localization of CBP/p300 are associated with progression,
prognosis, and resistance of many types of cancers.

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Onco-viruses, such as HTLV-1, SV40, and HPV, induce cancer, mediated, at least in part,
by manipulating CBP/p300 function. HTLV-1 is crucial for developing adult T-cell
leukemia. 84 HTLV-1 Tax protein interacts with CBP/p300 to activate gene expression
regulated by ATF/CREB and NF-kB pathways, but it inhibits p53-mediated gene
expression. 85,86 In addition, transforming protein SV40 large T antigen (SVT) interacts
with CBP/p300 87, which is required by SVT-mediated transformation 88,89, and increases
CBP/p300 protein levels through increasing the loading of CBP/p300-mRNA onto
polysomes. 90 Furthermore, the high-risk HPV E6 protein interacts with CBP/p300 directly
and blocks p300-mediated p53 acetylation and p53-dependent gene transcription. 91
Moreover, adenovirus E1A protein also interacts with CBP/p300 92 and alters gene
expression by reducing CBP/p300 recruitment on the promoters of differentiation-specific
genes but increasing the CBP/p300 loading on the promoters of genes involved in cell
proliferation. 93
CBP/p300 can also promote tumorigenesis independently of its effects on gene transcription.
p300 acetylates S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2), which is a driving factor in
tumorigenesis, leading to increased Skp2 stability and cytoplasmic retention. Cytoplasmic
Skp2 enhances cellular migration through ubiquitination and destruction of E-cadherin. 94
Tip60

Author Manuscript

Tip60 is the acetyltransferase component of a multiprotein Tip60 complex that includes up
to 16 subunits. The Tip60 complex also contains an ATPase, p400/TRAPP, and helicases,
Tip49a and Tip49b. 95,96 The Tip60 complex preferentially acetylates H2AK5, H3K14, and
H4K5/8/12/16. 97 Tip60 plays important roles not only in transcription but also in doublestrand DNA break repair and apoptosis. DNA damage induces accumulation of Tip60 98,
which acetylates and activates ATM kinase activity at sites of DNA damage. 99–101 In
addition, Tip60 also acetylates nucleosomal phosphor-H2Av, the Drosophila homolog of
human H2A.X, which results in its exchange with unmodified H2Av at DNA DSB loci. 102
Furthermore, Tip60 complex induces transcription of DNA repair and apoptosis genes by

interacting with E2F1 and p53, respectively. 103,104,105 Tip60 also acetylates the Abelson
murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog (Abl) and activates transcription-independent
apoptotic activity of Abl 106 As to the transcription related function, Tip60 is identified as
co-activator of AR, ER, PR, c-Myc, and more. 107,108,109,39,110 However, Tip60 is also
reported to repress STAT3, c-Myb, and beta-catenin dependent transcription in part through
recruiting HDACs. 111, 112,113

Author Manuscript

The majority of studies investigating the relationship of Tip60 and cancer show that Tip60
functions as a tumor suppressor. Tip60 has a haplo-insufficient tumor suppressor activity in
both mouse and human. 114 Tip60 heterozygosity impairs Myc-induced DNA damage repair
in B cells and accelerates the onset of Myc-induced B-cell lymphomas when breeding the
Tip60 heterozygous mice with Eu-myc transgenic mice, which develop spontaneous
lymphoma and leukemia. 115 In human cancer samples, Tip60 mRNA or protein level was
down regulated in colon, lung, mammary, head-and-neck carcinomas, metastatic prostate
cancer, metastatic melanoma, lymphomas, and AML. 116117114118112119113 In addition,
reduced Tip60 expression was associated with poor prognosis in primary and metastatic
melanoma patients. 119 However, Tip60 was over expressed in cisplatin-resistant human
lung cancer cells and knockdown of Tip60 expression rendered cells sensitive to cisplatin
treatment. 120 Moreover, in hormore refractory or androgen independent prostate cancer,
Tip60 predominantly accumulates in the nucleus rather than displays a more diffuse
distribution pattern observed in benign prostate hyperplasia or primary prostate cancer. 116
Consistent with this finding, it is also reported that Tip60 is up regulated in castrationresistant LNCaP derivative CxR cells, which results in an increase of acetylated androgen
receptor localizing in the nucleus and activation of androgen-dependent gene transcription
even in the absence of androgen. 121

Author Manuscript

Other KATs
Many other KATs have been also linked to cancer. HBO1, a member of the MYST family is
overexpressed in several breast cancer cell lines. HBO1 increases mammosphere formation
when phosphorylated by cyclin E/CDK2 122, suggesting that HBO1 overexpression may
lead to a more cancer stem cell like phenotype. The most common translocation in AML
fuses the KAT Moz, another MYST family member, with CBP. 123 This oncoprotein causes
disruption of the association between the differentiation factor AML1 and MOZ, thereby
inhibiting AML1 induced gene transcription. 124 Lack of AML1 target gene transcription
leads to a more undifferentiated state characteristic of cancer cells.
Acetylation of Non-histone Substrates

Author Manuscript

Over 6800 lysine acetylation sites have been identified in mammals 125 with 3600 sites on
1750 proteins identified in humans. 126 The acetylation of non-histone proteins initiates
diverse outcomes (Figure 1B). For example, transcription factors such as E2F1 127, cMyc 39, and beta-catenin 58 are stabilized by acetylation, while acetylation of PTEN
decreases its stability. 128 Acetylation may also affect the subcellular localization of a
protein, as in the case of SRY, where acetylation triggers translocation to the nucleus. 129
The DNA binding activity 53 of p53, as well as its stability 130, increases upon acetylation.

prevents association with both client proteins and its co-chaperones. 131,132 This
modification not only affects the function of Hsp90 but also reduces the activity of its client
proteins such as tyrosine kinase Chk1. 123

Author Manuscript

Acetylation is being recognized as increasingly important in metabolism. In addition to
mitochondria being the source of AcCoA, several mitochondrial proteins are subject to
acetylation. Acetylation of the glycolytic enzyme Phosphoglycerate mutase-1 (PGAM1)
stimulates its activity 133 whereas acetylation of the mitochondrial matrix protein AcCoA
synthetase 2 (AceSC2) inactivates the enzyme. 134 Zhao et al found that almost every
enzyme involved in the TCA cycle, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, fatty acid metabolism, the
urea cycle, and glycogen metabolism is acetylated in the liver. 135 Obviously acetylation has
a profound impact on metabolism. As cancer cells have an altered metabolism that gives
them a proliferative advantage, perhaps manipulation of these acetylation events might
provide another avenue for therapy development.
The proteins mentioned here constitute only a subset of the many proteins that are regulated
in some way by acetylation. In thinking about the functions of KATs in both normal cells
and cancer, it is important to keep in mind that effects on the non-histone substrates may be
as important, or even more important, as effects on histones. Clearly, additional work is
needed to identify the full range of acetylated proteins in the cell and the consequences of
changes in acetylation states in cancer and other diseases.

Therapies targeting KATs

Author Manuscript

Given the wide-reaching importance of acetylation to cellular function, inhibitors of both
KATs and HDACs have potential as anti-cancer therapies. HDAC inhibitors have been used
in clinical trials for some time now, with varied results. 2, 3, 136 These drugs show some
effect in leukemias and other blood borne cancers, especially in combination with other
epigenetic inhibitors, such as decitabine. 137 However, they have largely failed in solid
tumors. One intriguing possibility is that acetylation might augment the functions of Myc
and other oncogenic proteins that drive tumor progression and growth. Use of an HDAC
inhibitor in such cases might actually be detrimental rather than helpful. Genetic studies in
mice indicate that deletion of HDACs enhance the severity of Myc driven lymphomas or
solid tumors in mice 138, consistent with this idea. Clearly we need to know more about how
acetylation contributes to cancer initiation and progression, so that more rationale therapies
can be designed.
Regulation of KAT Activity

Author Manuscript

Normal means of KAT regulation provide ideas for development of KAT inhibitors.
Interestingly, KATs are regulated by multiple mechanisms. Many KATs are not fully active
unless associated with their partner proteins in KAT complexes. 139,140 Association into the
complex can affect not only the level of activity but also substrate specificity. 47 Gcn5, for
example, has very limited activity and substrate range alone, but when part of the full SAGA
complex, it efficiently acetylates multiple sites in histones H3 and H2B. 139 KATs
themselves are also subject to posttranslational modifications that affect their activity,
stability, and subcellular localization. Autoacetylation of p300 and MOF enhances their

enzymatic activity. 141,142 The nuclear localization signal in PCAF can be autoacetylated or
acetylated by p300 in the cytoplasm, increasing PCAF activity and promoting its
localization to the nucleus. 143 Some KATs, including GCN5 and PCAF, are also stabilized
upon binding of their coenzyme, AcCoA. 144

Author Manuscript

The many layers of regulation ensure that KAT activity is spatially and temporally restricted
in the cell and in the organism, and they also provide specific vulnerabilities for
development of small molecule inhibitors. For example, small molecules that interfere with
AcCoA or substrate binding would directly impair KAT acetyltransferase activity. Such
inhibition would affect acetylation of histones and associated transcription of oncogenes or
downstream oncogene targets (Figure 3A). It would also affect acetylation of non-histone
substrates, such as p53 and AR, thereby affecting the stability and activity of these
transcription factors (Figure 3A). In practice, however, it can be difficult to develop
inhibitors that specifically affect HATs and not other enzymes that utilize AcCoA.
Alternatively, small molecule inhibitors might be designed to block interactions between
KATs and other proteins, such as beta-catenin and HIF, which would affect transcription of
downstream genes. Although beta-catenin is not classified as a transcription factor, it
directly interacts with the transcription factor TCF/LEF to regulate downstream target genes
(Figure 3B). Similarly, KAT inhibitors might be designed to decrease KAT or transcription
factor occupancy at target genes by interfering with interactions with histones or the
transcriptional machinery.
We will summarize the current status of small molecule inhibitor development for the main
three KATs families that have so far shown some inhibitory effect on cancer cell growth in
vitro or on xenograft growth in vivo.

GCN5-PCAF Inhibitors

Author Manuscript

So far, several small molecule inhibitors of GCN5 and PCAF have been developed and
characterized in vitro. In most cases, these molecules are thought to act as substrate or
AcCoA mimics. The first identified GCN5 inhibitor, α-methylene-γ-butyrolactone 3
(MB-3), which decreases GCN5 acetyltransferase activity potently, was reported to decrease
acetylation and stabilization of the E2A-PBX1 oncoprotein in leukemia cells. 42 However,
the effect of MB-3 on leukemia cell growth and proliferation is not clear. A series of
thiazole derivatives, such as cyclopentylidene-[4-(4’-chlorophenyl)thiazol-2-yl)hydrazone
(CPTH2) 145, CPTH6 146, and BF1 147, also decrease GCN5 activity in vitro. This inhibition
is reversed upon increased concentration of H3, but not AcCoA 145, suggesting that thiazole
derivatives inhibit acetylation by competing with substrate binding to GCN5. CPTH6 has
been shown to impair viability and cell cycle progression, reflected by accumulation in
G0/G1 phase, of leukemia cells. 146 This year, a novel thiazole-based HAT inhibitor BF1,
was reported to inhibit the HAT activity of recombinant GCN5 and p300. BF1 treatment
reduced overall levels of H3 acetylation in HeLa, neuroblastoma, and glioblastoma cells.
However, BF1 administration had only modest effects on the viability of neuroblastoma
cells, and had even less effect on the viability of HeLa or glioblastoma cells. 147

The first selective PCAF inhibitor to be identified and synthesized was the bisubstrate
compound, H3-CoA-20 (IC50, 0.3uM). 148 However, this bisubstrate inhibitor lacks cellpermeability, which limits its development as a therapeutic drug. Anacardic acid, a chemical
compound from the cashew nut shell, is a potent inhibitor of PCAF and p300 (IC50, 5 and
8.5 µM, respectively). 149 Anacardic acid potentiated apoptosis induced by cytokine and
chemotherapeutic agents, which correlated with the down regulation of various gene
products that mediate proliferation, survival, invasion and angiogenesis regulated by NF-kB
in a series of human cancer cell lines 150 (Table 1). One anacardic acid derivative, 6d,
showed a twofold higher inhibitory effect than anacardic acid on PCAF HAT activity and
histone acetylation in liver hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells. 151 Garcinol, a potential
anti-cancer agent 152 from Garcinia indica fruit rind, is a potent inhibitor of p300 and PCAF
(IC50, 5uM and 7uM respectively). 153 Garcinol inhibits KATs by binding both the AcCoA
binding site and the histone binding site, 154 and it suppresses proliferation or induces
apoptosis of various cancer cells153, including HeLa cells, breast cancer cells 155–157, lung
cancer cells 158, pancreatic cancer cells 159, hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) cells 160, and
head and neck squamous carcinoma(HNSCC) cells 161 in vitro. Moreover, Garcinol has
been reported to inhibit the growth of human HCC and HNSCC xenograft tumors in athymic
nu/nu mice. 160,161 In addition, isothiazolones-based inhibitors for PCAF and p300,
CCT077791 and CCT077792, inhibit the growth of a panel of human tumor cell lines. 162
Unfortunately, the fact that these compounds are usually only effective in vitro when
administered in micromolar concentrations, along with ambiguities regarding their
specificity, greatly limits their utility as possible anticancer agents. Development of
additional types of inhibitors, perhaps directed at bromodomains in Gcn5 and PCAF, might
offer more promise in the future.

CBP/p300 Inhibitors

Author Manuscript

Several studies have focused on potential therapies targeting CBP/p300, more so than any
other type of KAT. Many kinds of CBP/p300 inhibitors have been identified or synthesized,
and their effects have been tested on tumor cell growth in vitro or in vivo. The first
identified selective p300 inhibitor was the bisubstrate inhibitor, Lys-CoA (IC50, 0.5uM). 148
However, Lys-CoA lacks cell-permeability, which can be somewhat improved by
conjugation to a cell permeabilizing peptide. 163 Another well-studied CBP/p300 inhibitor is
curcumin, which inhibits the KAT activity of purified p300 (IC50, 25uM) in vitro. 164
Curcumin inhibits p300-mediated acetylation of p53 and induces apoptosis in HeLa
cells. 165 It can also affect cell proliferation of prostate cancer cells through modulation of
aberrantly activated Wnt signaling. 166 In addition, curcumin suppresses CBP/p300
occupancy at AR target genes and inhibits xenograft tumor growth of androgen sensitive
cells and CRPC cells. Co-treatment with curcumin and androgen deprivation reduces tumor
growth and delays the onset of castration-resistant tumors. 167
ICG-001 is a specific CBP/beta-catenin antagonist that blocks CBP/beta-catenin interactions
(IC50, 3uM) but not p300/beta-catenin interactions. 168 Treatment with ICG-001 leads to the
differentiation of pre-B ALL cells and eradication of drug-resistant primary leukemia when
used in combination with conventional therapy in vitro (VDL (Vincristine, Dexamethasone

and L-Aparaginase) or Nilotinib for Philadelphia chromosome negative or positive ALL
cells, respectively). ICG-001 also significantly improves the survival of NOD/SCID mice
engrafted with primary ALL. 169

Author Manuscript

Chetomin, a natural small molecule that disrupts the interaction of HIF-1 with CBP/p300,
abolishes the differentiation inhibitory effect of HIF-1alpha. Combined administration of
chetomin with forskolin, a differentiation inducer, significantly suppresses malignant glioma
growth in vitro and in vivo in a xenograft model. 170 Another CBP/p300 inhibitor, C646,
(IC50, 1.6uM) 171 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis selectively in AML1-ETO-positive
AML cells. 172 C646 also promotes sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, leading to
enhanced apoptosis of melanoma cells after combination treatment with cisplatin. 173
Furthermore, C646 treatment in Foxp3+ T regulatory cells increased T cell receptor-induced
apoptosis of T regulatory cells, limited tumor growth in immunocompetent but not in
immunodeificient mice. 174

Author Manuscript

Besides these well-established inhibitors for CBP/p300 HAT activity or CBP/p300
interaction with transcription factors, researchers continue to screen or synthesize novel
compounds to inhibit CBP/p300 function. Plumbagin (RTK1), a natural compound isolated
from Plumbago rosea root extract, inhibits specifically p300-mediated acetylation of
p53. 175 NK13650A and NK13650B (IC50, 11 and 22 nM, respectively), a microbial
metabolite, inhibits p300 HAT activity and inhibited hormone-dependent and-independent
growth of prostate cancer cells. 176 Arylsulfonamide KCN1 interferes with the interaction
between HIF-1alpha and CBP/p300 (IC50, ~590nM), and potently inhibits the growth of
subcutaneous malignant glioma tumor xenografts. 177 L002 (IC50, 1.98uM), interacting with
the active site of the p300 catalytic domain, potently suppressed tumor growth of MDAMB-468 xenografts as well as proliferation of leukemia and lymphoma cell lines. 178 HBS, a
protein domain mimic, targets the interaction of the HIF-1alpha with p300/CBP and
suppresses tumor growth in a renal cell carcinoma murine xenograft model. 179 Windorphen,
a selective small molecule targeting beta-catenin and inhibiting p300, robustly and
selectively kills cancer cells that harbor Wnt activating mutations. 180 CH1iB, a novel smallmolecule inhibitor of p300 targeting HPV16 E6-p300 interaction, reactivates p53 and
enhances the anticancer effect of cis-platinum on HPV-positive head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma cells. 181
Tip60 Inhibitors

Author Manuscript

Interestingly, Tip60 is down regulated in primary cancer cells but becomes up regulated in
drug resistant cancer cells. 119,120 This discrepancy may be explained by the regulatory
processes used by cells to decide between life and death. Since Tip60 is crucial for the DNA
repair process, its down regulation causes cells to accumulate genomic instabilities induced
by oncofactors, and can eventually lead to uncontrolled cellular growth. However, after
treatment of cells with therapeutic DNA damage inducing agents, drug-resistant cells exhibit
higher levels of DNA repair that requires Tip60. Thus, inhibition of Tip60 activity might
provide a potential strategy to treat DNA damaging drug-resistant cancers. Other agents also
affect Tip60 functions in DNA repair. Anacardic acid and its analogs, 6-alkylsalicylates,
inhibit Tip60 182 and sensitize HeLa cells to ionizing radiation. 183 In addition, pentamidine,

a bisbenzamidine derivative that inhibits Tip60 acetyltransferase activity, also increases the
radio-sensitivity of HeLa cells. 184 Moreover, two newly identified Tip60 inhibitors,
NU9056 (IC50, 2uM) and TH1834, are reported to inhibit cell proliferation and induce
apoptosis in prostate cancer cells and breast cancer cells, respectively. 185,186
Limitations of KAT Inhibitors
Almost all of the studies on KAT inhibitors are currently still in a preclinical phase. Only
curcumin has been moved forward into clinical trials as a potential anti-cancer therapy.
According to data currently available in the ClinicalTrials.gov database, about 35 registered
clinical trials are ongoing in cancer patients, including colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer,
lung cancer, and leukemia patients, with curcumin alone or combined with other
chemotherapy agents. Better agents, with greater specificity and better pharmokinetic
properties are sorely needed.

An alternative to inhibiting KATs directly is to inhibit readers of KAc. Bromodomain
inhibitors are showing much promise in early trials as effective therapies for a variety of
tumor types. Bromodomain inhibitors act as acetyl-lysine mimics that occupy the acetylated
lysine binding site in bromodomain-containing proteins (Figure 3C), such as BRD4 and
BRD2. 187 They affect the gene expression profile of leukemia or solid tumor cells,
highlighted by downregulation of Myc expression, which results in suppression of tumor
cell growth and proliferation. 188,189 A few bromodomain inhibitors, such as I-BET762,
OTX015, CP-0610, and TEN-010, are in clinical phase I trials to test their efficacy on
various hematological malignancies and solid tumors. 190 Combinational treatment using
both a BRD4 inhibitor and an HDAC inhibitor has been reported to synergistically induce
apoptosis of leukemia cells and improve the survival of mice engrafted with leukemia
cells. 191 Such combination therapies may also prove greatly beneficial. Since most KATs
contain bromodomains, combinational treatment of inhibitors targeting these domains
together with BET bromodomain inhibitors might also have synergic effects on inhibiting
tumor growth, by limiting both the expression and the function of oncoproteins such as cMyc. Combination therapies are attractive as they may allow use of the two agents in low
dose, thereby increasing effectiveness while also reducing side effects or toxicities
associated with use of single inhibitors in high dose.

Conclusion and Perspectives

Author Manuscript

Although aberrations of KATs have been reported widely in human cancers, our
understanding of the functions of KATs in tumor development and progression is still
limited. While some studies show that KATs act as tumor suppressors, other studies indicate
that KATs promote tumor progression by promoting oncogene expression or function,
providing a strong, rationale for the development of KAT inhibitors as anti-cancer agents.
The paradox that both KAT and HDAC inhibitors may be beneficial as anti-cancer agents
illustrates the necessity of defining the full range of functions of these enzymes in specific
cancer settings. Alterations in the balance of these enzyme activities might lead to hallmark
changes in histone modification status that could provide cancer biomarkers for predicting
prognosis and for determining best treatment options for cancer patients. 192 A greater

understanding of the functions of KATs and HDACs in both normal cells and in cancer will
also allow better design of combination therapies using inhibitors for these enzymes together
with other epigenetic agents, such as bromodomain inhibitors.

Figure 1. Mechanisms of action of acetylation

A. KATs target both tails and globular domains of all 4 histone proteins. B. KATs acetylate
non-histone proteins including transcription factors (TF) as well as metabolic enzymes and
other nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. C. Bromodomain-containing proteins bind to acetyllysines on histone tails and on non-histone proteins.

Figure 3. The mechanisms of small molecule inhibitors targeting lysine acetylation

A. Small molecule KAT inhibitors can impair KAT acetyltransferase activity by interfering
with AcCoA or substrate binding. The substrates include histone and non-histone proteins,
such as p53 and AR. B. Small molecule KAT inhibitors can block interactions between
KATs and other proteins, such as beta-catenin and HIF, which would affect transcription of
downstream genes. C. Bromodomain inhibitors act as acetyl-lysine mimics that occupy the
acetylated lysine binding site in bromodomain-containing proteins.
