Summary

Author Manuscript

While engagement of the inhibitory Fcγ-Receptor (FcγR) IIB is an absolute requirement for in
vivo antitumor activity of agonistic mouse anti-CD40 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), a similar
requirement for human mAbs has been disputed. By using a mouse model humanized for its
FcγRs and CD40, we revealed that FcγRIIB-engagement is essential for the activity of the human
CD40 mAbs, while engagement of the activating FcγRIIA inhibits this activity. By engineering Fc
variants with selective enhanced binding to FcγRIIB, but not to FcγRIIA, significantly improved
antitumor immunity was observed. These findings highlight the necessity of optimizing the Fc
domain for this class of therapeutic antibodies by using appropriate pre-clinical models that
accurately reflect the unique affinities and cellular expression of human FcγR.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Therapeutic targeting of CD40 by agonistic mAbs aims to activate CD40+ APCs to
effectively boost tumor specific cytotoxic T cells to eliminate tumor cells. In principle it has
the advantage of greater tumor specificity over other T cell activation approaches, such as
checkpoint inhibition or indiscriminate T cell activation. While agonistic CD40 mAbs have
been developed for immunotherapy (Melero et al., 2007; Vonderheide and Glennie, 2013),
their clinical efficacy has been limited (Chowdhury et al., 2014; Furman et al., 2010),
suggesting that optimization is required. The in vivo activity of agonistic mAbs targeting
mouse CD40 was shown to be dependent on FcγR-crosslinking by the inhibitory FcγRIIB
(Li and Ravetch, 2011; Li and Ravetch, 2012; White et al., 2011). FcγRIIB functions in
trans, i.e. located on neighboring cells to antibody-ligated CD40+ cells, and independently of
FcγRIIB signaling components (Li and Ravetch, 2013). FcγRIIB acts as a scaffold to
enhance the clustering of CD40 on the membrane, thereby mimicking the effect of their
endogenous multimeric ligands engaging these multimeric receptors.
There are two conserved classes of Type I FcγRs that can be distinguished functionally: the
activating receptors (FcγRI, FcγRIII, and FcγRIV in mice; FcγRIA, FcγRIIA/C, and
FcγRIIIA in humans) and the inhibitory receptor (FcγRIIB in both mice and humans). A
third class of Type I FcγRs is uniquely found in humans: a GPI-linked receptor expressed on

neutrophils, FcγRIIIB, that functions to concentrate immune complexes on neutrophils. (For
detailed reviews see (Nimmerjahn and Ravetch, 2008; Pincetic et al., 2014). FcγR-dependent
responses mediated by different IgG subclasses are dependent on their differential binding
affinities to activating vs. inhibitory FcγRs (Nimmerjahn and Ravetch, 2005). Mouse IgG1
has preferential binding to the inhibitory FcγRIIB and is the only subclass of mouse CD40
agonistic mAbs that is active in vivo (Li and Ravetch, 2011; White et al., 2011). The
relatively high homology between mouse and human FcγR systems accounts for many of the
general aspects of conserved FcγR-mediated mechanisms between the species. However,
several aspects that differentiate human from mouse need to be considered when translating
the FcγR-mediated mechanisms observed in the mouse system into human IgG-based
therapeutics. First, there are both structural diversity and different cellular expression
patterns of FcγRs between the species. Second, mouse and human IgG subclasses differ in
their affinities to their cognate FcγRs.

CP-870,893, a fully human IgG2, is the most potent agonistic CD40 mAb among those
tested in clinical trials to date and has demonstrated immune activation in vitro and evidence
of objective tumor responses in patients (Bajor et al., 2014; Vonderheide et al., 2007). Based
on previous studies using mouse antibodies in wild-type and FcγR deficient mice it was
proposed that human, agonistic anti-CD40 antibodies would show a similar dependence on
FcγRIIB engagement to optimize CD40 crosslinking (Li and Ravetch, 2011). However, the
low affinity interactions of the IgG2 isotype of CP-870,893 with human FcγRs, including
FcγRIIB (see Figure 1), raised the question of whether FcγRIIB-engagement was an
absolute requirement for the activity of this mAb, and whether Fc optimization would be
necessary to result in improved potency. The notion that Fc engagement might be
unnecessary for this antibody was first suggested in an in vitro study demonstrating
FcγRIIB-independent activity of CP-870,893 (Richman and Vonderheide, 2014).
Subsequently, a recent in vivo study further supported an FcγR-independent activity of the
human IgG2 subclass mediated by the unique hinge properties of this subclass (White et al.,
2015). These studies, however, were limited in their ability to recapitulate the activity of
CP-870,893 and other human CD40 mAbs in the model systems used. Attempts to model
human IgG interactions with human FcγR-expressing cells in vitro may fail to mimic the
diversity of cellular populations that may be required for an in vivo response. Thus, while in
vivo assays are required, the studies reported to date were performed in either wild-type or
mouse FcγR knockout strains and thus fail to address the unique binding affinities and tissue
distribution of human FcγRs as compared to their mouse homologues.

Generation of CD40/FcγR humanized mice
To be able to accurately and efficiently evaluate the activity of human anti-CD40 Fc variants
and to enable the selection of an optimized clinical candidate, we generated an isogenic
mouse model humanized for CD40 and FcγRs on a background lacking the mouse
homologues of these receptors (described in detail in Experimental Procedures). First, we
generated humanized CD40 mice on a mouse CD40-deficient background. We evaluated the
expression pattern of the human CD40 on different immune cell populations in these mice

and found that, similar to the pattern found on human cells, human CD40 expressed on
blood B cells, dendritic cells, monocytes and macrophages, but not on T cell, neutrophils, or
NK cells (Figure 1A). The expression pattern of CD40 in these mice is similar to the
expression of the mouse homolog in wild type mice (Figure S1A).

Author Manuscript

To verify the functionality of the human CD40 (hCD40) transgene in these mice, we
evaluated the formation of germinal centers (GC), a process that requires CD40 signaling
(Basso et al., 2004). While Cd40−/− mice lost the ability to form a GC, this phenotype is
restored upon the introduction of the huCD40 transgene (Figure 1B), mediated by the
interaction of the huCD40 with the mouse CD40 ligand, which have similar binding kinetics
and affinity to human CD40 ligand (Figure S1B). Cd40−/− mice have a deficient antigenspecific IgG response upon immunization, which is restored upon introduction of the
huCD40 transgene (Figure 1C), confirming that hCD40 transgene functionally complements
the mouse CD40 deficiency. Together, these data demonstrate that the humanized CD40
mice recapitulate the expression pattern and function of the human CD40 gene in human. To
generate a mouse model in which fully human agonistic IgGs against human CD40 can be
evaluated, we crossed these CD40 humanized mice to our previously described humanized
FcγR mice (DiLillo and Ravetch, 2015; Smith et al., 2012) resulting in a strain of mice
expressing the human CD40 and FCGR1A, FCGR2AR131, FCGR2BI232, FCGR3AF158, and
FCGR3B under the control of their endogenous human regulatory elements on an isogenic
background deleted for the homologous mouse genes. These mice recapitulate hCD40 and
hFcγR expression patterns and expression levels in human, and the human receptors are
fully competent to signal appropriately in the mouse background.
Generation of human anti-CD40-Fc-variant clinical candidates

Author Manuscript

To test whether the in vivo activity of human IgGs targeting human CD40 requires
interaction with hFcγRIIB and determine if such interactions can be further engineered to
optimize the activity of the parent antibody, we cloned the variable regions of anti-CD40
CP-870,893 Ab (originally an IgG2 isotype) into Fc-modified Abs with differential capacity
to engage human FcγRs. These include wild type human IgG1 and a series of mutated IgG1s
with increased binding affinities to hFcγRIIB. We verified by ELISA (Figure 1D) and
Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) (Table S1) that the different Fc domains introduced into
CP-870,893 Abs did not alter either their binding specificity or their affinity to human
CD40. Table S2 summarizes the affinities of different Fc variants of CP-870,893 to
recombinant hFcγRI, hFcγRIIA, hFcγRIIB, and hFcγRIIIA, as evaluated by SPR.
FcγR-engagement is required for the in vivo activity of human anti-CD40 mAbs

Author Manuscript

While the IgG1 isotype has relatively high affinity interactions with all human FcγRs, the
IgG2 isotype of CP-870,893 has very low binding affinities to human FcγRs, with the
exception of the FcγRIIAH131 (Bruhns et al., 2009)(Figure 2A and Table S2). We wished to
compare the efficacy of the IgG1 and IgG2 isotypes of anti-CD40 in vivo in the context of
human FcγRs. Therefore, we tested their ability to activate and expand T cells in the
humanized CD40/FcγR model. We delivered ovalbumin (OVA) to dendritic cells by the
chimeric anti-DEC205 Ab conjugated to OVA (“DEC-OVA” (Li and Ravetch, 2011))
together with either human IgG1-Fc, IgG2-Fc, or N297A Fc-null subclasses of CP-870,893

anti-CD40 mAb, and monitored for the presence of OVA-specific T cells in the circulation
after 7 days (Figure 2B). While both IgG1 and IgG2 isotypes had adjuvant effects on T cell
activation, IgG1 resulted in a significantly higher T cell response as compared to the IgG2
isotype of the same anti-CD40 clone. The activity of IgG1 was completely abolished by
introducing the N297A mutation, which prevents binding to FcγRs, implying that FcγRengagement is required for the agonistic activity of the anti-CD40 IgG1. The significant
activity of IgG2 was lost when tested as deglycosylated form that has reduced binding
affinity to FcγRIIb compared to wild type IgG2 (Figure S2A, S2B). This implies on FcγRdependent activity of anti-CD40 IgG2 as well and suggesting that the relatively reduced
activity of IgG2 compared to IgG1 isotype may be explained by its low binding affinities to
human FcγRs. In contrast to that conclusion, the agonistic activity of an anti-CD40 antibody
of the IgG2 subclass has been proposed to be FcγR-independent and the result of the unique
configuration of the IgG2 hinge (White et al., 2015), mediated by shuffled disulfide bonds
between the IgG2 hinge and CH1 regions. To test that possibility, we mutated specific
cysteines of CP-870,893 that resulted in locked conformational forms (Figure S2C)- the
classical Y conformation “IgG2-A” and the more compact conformation “IgG2-B” obtained
by C232S and C127S mutations, respectively (Allen et al., 2009). Both forms of IgG2
resulted in activity similar to wild type IgG2, implying that the hinge region conformation
does not dictate the in vivo agonistic activity of the IgG2 isotype of this Ab clone in the
context of human FcγRs (Figure 2B). Moreover, we compared the in vivo agonist activity of
the IgG2-A and IgG2-B forms of CP-870,893 in human CD40 transgenic mice on either a
mouse or a human FcγR background and found that in the mouse FcγR background only the
IgG2-B form is active while in the human FcγR background both forms have significant and
similar activity (Figure 2C). The data obtain from the CP-870,893 Abs is supported further
by the similar hierarchy in agonistic activity observed for the IgG1 and the 2A and 2B forms
of IgG2 subclass of ChiLob 7/4, another agonistic human CD40 Ab clone that recognizes an
epitope distinct from CP-870,893. While the IgG2 subclass of ChiLob 7/4 was reported to
have superior potency compared to its IgG1 form in the absence or presence of mouse
FcγRs, we also observed that for this clone, in the presence of human FcγRs, the IgG1
subclass is superior to IgG2, and that both IgG2 conformational forms have similar activity
(Figure 2D). As observed for CP-870,893, when tested in huCD40/mFcγR mice, only the
IgG2-B form is active and results in significant enhanced activity as compared to IgG2-A
(Figure 2E).

Author Manuscript

These data imply that in the physiological context of human FcγRs, agonistic, human antiCD40 IgGs depend on FcγR-engagement but not on their hinge-conformation for their in
vivo activity. Importantly, the data highlights the importance of using the humanized FcγR
mouse model in order to appropriately study human IgGs activity. By considering the
interaction of human IgG with human FcγRs, these mice avoid the confounding results that
can be generated by using human IgGs in models carrying mouse FcγRs.
Optimized activity of anti-CD40 human IgGs achieved by Fc variants enhanced for
FcγRIIB- but not FcγRIIA-binding
We next determined whether increasing the binding interactions between human anti-CD40
antibodies and hFcγRIIB will result in increased in vivo efficacy. The binding affinity and

selectivity of human IgGs to hFcγRIIB can be increased by mutagenesis of their Fc domain.
Fc variants of CP-870,893 carrying the mutations S267E (SE) and S267E/L328F (SELF)
(Chu et al., 2008) result in 30- and 70-fold increased binding affinity to hFcγRIIB,
respectively (Figure 3A and Table S2). When administrated to the humanized FcγR/CD40
mice, these Fc variants resulted in small but significant increases in their ability to activate T
cells as compared to both the wild type IgG1 and IgG2 variants of CP-870,893 (Figure 3B).

Author Manuscript

Due to the sequence and structural similarity between hFcγRIIA and hFcγRIIB, the SE and
SELF mutations also result in increased binding affinity to the activating hFcγRIIA.
Therefore, despite an increase in their binding affinity to the inhibitory hFcγRIIB, the
FcγRIIA/FcγRIIB binding affinity ratio of these mutated IgGs is similar to that of wild type
IgG1 and were thus predicted to result in limited increased activity of this subclass as was
observed (Figure 3B). To optimize the Fc-engagement of FcγRIIB over FcγRIIA, we
generated Fc variants of CP-870,893 with the recently described mutations, G237D/P238D/
P271G/A330R (V9) and G237D/P238D/H268D/P271G/A330R (V11), which enhance
binding affinity specifically to hFcγRIIB but not to hFcγRIIA (Mimoto et al., 2013). V9CP-870,893 and V11-CP-870,893 Fc variants result in 32- and 97-fold increased binding
affinity to hFcγRIIB, respectively, and about 3-fold decreased binding affinity to
hFcγRIIAR131 (Figure 3A and Table S2). Both V9 and V11 Fc variants have significantly
improved in vivo activity compared to the IgG2 subclass of CP-870,893 (IgG2), and its SE-,
and SELF-Fc variants enhanced for binding of both hFcγRIIB and hFcγRIIA. The
CP-870,893-V11 variant results in 25-fold increase in T cell activation compared to
CP-870,893-IgG2, and 5-fold increase compared to the activity obtained by the SELF
variant (Figure 3B). A similar hierarchy was observed for CP-870,893 Fc variants when
change in body weight was determined after antibody administration (Figure S3A). While
all Fc variants tested resulted in statistically significant decreases in body weight after a
single injection of CP-870,893, the group injected with the V11-Fc had the most significant
reduction.
We analyzed the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of these Fc variants to test whether their
differential FcγR binding leads to differential PK clearance rates that can account for their
differential agonistic activities. SELF and V11 Fc variants of CP-870,893 were found to
have a faster clearance rate than the IgG2 subclass (Figure S3B), presumably a result of their
enhanced FcγRIIB binding activity. However, despite the fact that SELF and V11 have faster
clearance rates, they display superior agonistic activity compared to IgG2. Similarly, despite
the similar PK properties of SELF and V11, V11 is a superior agonist compared to SELF.
We can therefore exclude the possibility that different PK properties of these Fc variants
account for their agonistic activity.

Author Manuscript

To further evaluate the influence of hFcγRIIA-engagement on the activity of CP-870,893,
we compared its activity in mice transgenic for human CD40 and FcγRIIB, but not for
FcγRIIA or mice transgenic to human CD40, FcγRIIB, and FcγRIIA (Figure 3C). The T cell
activation potency of CP-870,893-IgG2 is significantly enhanced in the absence of FcγRIIA,
indicating the negative role of FcγRIIA-engagement on the agonistic activity of this antiCD40 mAb.

Taken together, our data demonstrate that engineering CP-890,873 for enhanced hFcγRIIBengagement while keeping a low FcγRIIA/FcγRIIB binding ratio results in optimized in vivo
agonistic activity of human anti-CD40 IgGs.
Fc-optimized anti-CD40 IgGs can increase agonistic activity without enhancing platelet
activation related toxicity

Author Manuscript

Human platelets express both CD40 and FcγRIIA (the only FcγR expressed on platelets).
Both CD40 ligation (Inwald et al., 2003) and FcγRIIA crosslinking (Meyer et al., 2009;
Robles-Carrillo et al., 2010) on platelets can result in their activation. Since a transient
decrease in platelet count was reported in clinical trials after administration of CP-870,893IgG2 (Ruter et al., 2010; Vonderheide et al., 2013), we sought to compare platelet counts in
response to administration of the different Fc variants in the humanized CD40/FcγR mice
(Figure 3D). We observed a statistically significant decrease in platelet count 24 hours after
injection for all the tested CP-870,893 Fc variants, while the magnitude of the decrease for
each Fc variant directly correlated with its agonistic potency. Thus, the decrease of platelet
count is dependent on CD40- and not FcγRIIA- expression on platelets and requires
FcγRIIB-crosslinking. An exception was observed for the IgG1 subclass, which results in
the greatest degree of thrombocytopenia, similar to the levels observed for V9 and V11
variants. This is despite the relatively low agonistic activity of this clone compared to the
other tested Fc variants. IgG1 is the only tested subclass that significantly engages activating
FcγRIIIA and therefore presumably mediates direct platelet depletion through phagocytosis
and not through FcγRIIB-dependent agonism. Similar to what was reported in the clinical
studies, the decrease in platelet count observed in our humanized mouse model was also
transient with a return to baseline 7 days after the mAb injections (Figure S3C).

Author Manuscript

To test whether increasing the agonistic activity mediated by the V11-Fc will be
accompanied by enhanced thrombocytopenia, we reduced the dose of the injected
CP-870,893-V11 to a level that resulted in similar platelet counts for that Fc variant as to
that of the unmodified IgG2 version (Figure S3D). We found that reducing the dose of V11
by 2.5-fold resulted in a comparable level of thrombocytopenia to that of IgG2 and resulted
in similar levels of platelet depletion for the two antibodies. However, at this reduced dose of
the V11 variant we still observe significantly improved agonistic activity over IgG2 in vivo.
At a five-fold reduced dose of V11 no decrease in platelet counts were observed while
agonistic activity was maintained at a level comparable to that of human IgG2 (Figure S3D).
Altogether, these data imply that modifying CP-870,893 into V11-Fc can result in improved
therapeutic efficacy without increasing its related toxicity.

Multiple agonistic, anti-CD40 antibodies demonstrate FcγRIIB-mediated enhancement,
regardless of the epitopes they recognize
We sought to test if this hierarchy in the in vivo agonistic activity between the FcγRIIBenhanced Fc variants can be applied to additional agonistic anti-CD40 mAbs. Previous
studies have suggested that certain epitopes recognized by agonistic anti-CD40 antibodies
may display FcγR-independent activity and that such epitope-dependent distinction of their
FcγR-requirement is determined by their ability to compete with CD40L binding (Richman
and Vondeheide, 2014). We therefore evaluated two recently developed human anti-CD40

mAbs, clones CD40.1 and CD40.2 that are distinguished in their ability to block CD40L
binding to hCD40. Antibodies CD40.1 and CD40.2 were developed from standard
immunization methods in mice by immunization with recombinant CD40 or CD40
expressing cells followed by screening, resulting in antibodies binding to CD40, and
functional activation of B and DC cells. CD40.1 and CD40.2 bind to a monomer of CD40
with a KD of 4.8 nM and 9.1 nM in SPR experiments, respectively. CD40.2 recognizes
epitopes overlapping with the CD40L binding site whereas CD40.1 binds hCD40 at an
epitope distinct from its CD40L binding site, similar to CP-870,893 (Figures 4A and 4B).

Author Manuscript

In vitro DC activation assays demonstrated significant activity for the SE-, and V11-Fc
variants of CD40.1 clone while CD40.1 Fc variants exhibit enhanced activity compared to
CD40.2 variants (Figure S4A, S4B). Although the in vitro activity of the CD40.1-Fc variants
is greater than the wild type IgG1 (Figure S4B), the in vitro studies do not distinguish
between the activity of the different Fc variants. We therefore evaluated the activity of these
antibodies and their Fc variants in the humanized CD40/FcγR mice. As was observed for
clone CP-870,893, the selective FcγRIIB-enhanced V11 Fc variant of these mAbs displayed
superior activity in vivo compared to its FcγRIIA/IIB-enhanced SE variant and the wild type
IgG1 subclass (Figure 4C). Moreover, the magnitude of the in vivo activity of the CD40.1V11 is about 20-fold higher than the activity of CP-870,893 (IgG2) (Figure S4C). Similar to
CP-870,893 derivatives, CD40.1 Fc variants exhibit a direct correlation between their
agonistic potency and the magnitude of the decrease in platelet count (Figure 4D),
demonstrating the generality of these observations.

Author Manuscript

These data demonstrate that selective enhancement of FcγRIIB-binding increases the in vivo
activity of multiple anti-CD40 mAbs and that in vitro assays are not predictive of the in vivo
activity of these Fc variants. Moreover, increased immunostimulatory activity by selective
enhancement of FcγRIIB binding was demonstrated for CP-870,893 and CD40.1 mAbs that
do not block the binding of hCD40 to CD40L, and for the CD40L blocking anti-CD40 mAb
CD40.2, demonstrating that agonist human anti-CD40 mAbs can be optimized by selective
enhancement of FcγRIIB-binding through Fc engineering independent of their binding
epitopes and their ability to cross block CD40L binding to CD40.
V11 Fc variant of anti-CD40 Abs has superior anti-tumor activity

Author Manuscript

We next evaluated whether the increased agonistic activity observed for the FcγRIIBenhanced mutated Fc variants can be translated into increased anti-tumor activity of antiCD40 mAbs. Humanized CD40/FcγR mice were inoculated with the syngeneic MC38 colon
adenocarcinoma tumors and treated with IgG2-, SELF-, and V11- Fc variants of CP-870,893
(Figure 5A). Treatments with both IgG2 and SELF result in similar antitumor effects (about
65% reduction in tumor volume compared to untreated control and 20% to 33% of tumor
free mice, respectively). However, treatment with the V11 Fc variant results in a
dramatically improved antitumor response and complete recovery from tumors of all the
mice. A similar trend was observed using the B16 metastatic melanoma model in which a
statistically significant reduction in the number of lung metastases was observed only in
mice treated with V11, but not with SELF or IgG2 Fc variants (Figures 5B, S5). Next we
evaluated the anti tumor activity of CD40.1 and CD40.2. Wild type IgG1, SE and V11

mutants of each clone were tested for their activity in the MC38 tumor model (Figure 5C).
The FcγRIIB-selectively enhanced V11 variants of these Abs have superior anti tumor
activity compared to the other tested Fc variants, consistent with their in vivo T cell
stimulation activity and with the anti-tumor hierarchy observed for CP-870,893 derivatives.
We did not observe the clearance of circulating dendritic cells after treatment with CD40.1
IgG1 (data not shown), indicating that its diminished activity relative to V11 or SE variants
is due to its reduced binding affinity to FcγRIIB and not a result of activating FcγR-mediated
elimination of CD40+ cells. Nevertheless, introduction of agonistic CD40 Abs as an IgG1
subclass may result in depletion of dendritic cells and other CD40+ target cells, depending
on the dosing and the epitope-specificity of each Ab clone.

Author Manuscript

Tumor-free mice from the CD40.1-V11 treated group were re-challenged with MC38 tumor
cells 30 days after their CD40 Ab treatment. All mice in this group rejected the tumors
within two weeks of the re-challenge, implying a long-term protection that is mediated by
single injection of CD40-V11 (Figure 5D).
These data indicate that the antitumor activity of agonistic human CD40 Abs can be
enhanced by Fc engineering that provides selective enhancement of FcγRIIB-engagement
and highlight the V11 Fc variant as the optimal clinical platform of this class of Abs.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

The requirements for FcγR interactions for the therapeutic activity of an increasing number
of immunomodulatory mAbs (Bulliard et al., 2013; Bulliard et al., 2014; Dahan et al., 2015;
Selby et al., 2013; Simpson et al., 2013) have emphasized the need to optimize these
reagents by proper selection of the Fc domain. The importance of FcγRIIB-engagement for
the activity of the CD40 mAb has been characterized in details using mouse FcγR model
systems (Li and Ravetch, 2011; Li and Ravetch, 2012; Li and Ravetch, 2013; White et al.,
2011), but their translational relevance into human therapeutics has been disputed. Here we
demonstrate the importance of FcγR interactions for human CD40 mAb and how selective
manipulation of FcγR-interactions by Fc-engineering enhances the potency of these mAbs.
These conclusions were made possible through the use of a representative in vivo model that
faithfully recapitulates the diversity and cell type specificity of the human FcγR system.
Such in vivo models have recently been demonstrated to be essential to evaluating the FcγRmediated activities of human IgGs in other applications (DiLillo and Ravetch, 2015; Schwab

The gap in our knowledge regarding FcγR-requirements for the activity of human CD40
mAbs in clinical development was due to the lack of an appreciation of the species
differences between mice and humans and the use of inappropriate pre-clinical models to
evaluate interactions between human Abs and FcγRs. By using CP-870,893 and its
derivatives in the humanized CD40/FcγR mice, we observed not only a lack of activity of
the Fc null variant but also an increased potency of selective FcγRIIB-enhanced Fc variants.
These findings were confirmed using additional CD40 agonistic mAbs, demonstrating that
mice humanized for FcγRs are an important model to evaluate Fc-FcγR interactions and
their effect on the activity of human IgGs. In vitro studies have failed to reflect the

complexity and diversity of hFcγRs in vivo and led to inappropriate conclusions regarding
FcγR-requirement for CP-870,893 activity (Richman and Vonderheide, 2014). Our study
also refutes the notion that the epitope specificity of agonistic CD40 mAb determines its
FcγR-requirements (FcγR-independent vs, -dependent, respectively) for activity. CP-870,893
and CD40.1 do not compete with CD40L binding but proved to be FcγR-dependent for their
optimal activity in vivo. Moreover, we generated a human mAb, CD40.2, which is similar to
the murine Abs that block CD40L binding to CD40, and demonstrated that the activity of
this mAb is also optimized by FcγRIIB-engagement.

Author Manuscript

Different modes-of-action can be observed between different mAbs although they share the
same target molecule. For example, we have recently observed that antagonistic PD-1 mAbs
have the potential to deliver FcγRIIB-dependent agonism based on their epitope specificity
(Dahan et al., 2015b). Although mouse models can be very informative for evaluating mAb
activity, translating mAb activity in the mouse to human therapeutic is not straightforward
and therapeutic mechanisms observed for a mouse mAb can be altered while developing the
homologous human IgGs. By humanizing both CD40 and FcγRs, we generated a mouse
model that enables in vivo evaluation of clinical products by considering the activity
mediated by both their Fab and Fc domains. These mice allow for “lead” selection among a
panel of human CD40 mAbs based on their in vivo agonistic potency. A similar approach
should be used for the generation of mice humanized for other therapeutic targets on the
huFcγR background for optimal selection of additional immunomodulatory mAbs.

Author Manuscript

The humanized CD40/FcγR mice used in this study are a significant improvement over
previous models used to characterize the activity of human CD40 Abs. Nevertheless, the
presence of murine IgG in the serum of these mice may lead to unnecessary complications
mediated by the interaction of human FcγRs with the endogenous murine IgGs. However,
the binding of human FcγRs to mouse IgGs are significantly lower than to their cognate
human IgGs (Ravetch and Nimmerjahn, 2008) and are not expected to confound the
interpretation. To address this potential complication we are working on incorporating
human IgG Fc in place of the mouse locus in order to evaluate the activity of human Abs in
the context of human serum IgG antibodies. In addition, this model will allow to test long
term chronic administration of hAbs by providing tolerance to human IgGs.

Author Manuscript

Although improved agonistic activity is mediated by Fc variants enhanced for both FcγRIIA
and FcγRIIB binding, their potency is limited by their enhanced binding to the activating
FcγRIIA. Therefore, Fc variants with selective enhancement in binding solely to the
inhibitory FcγRIIB have been indicated by this study as the most potent CD40 mAb
derivatives. Lack of activity of mouse CD40 mAbs carrying the IgG2a subclass that
preferentially binds activating FcγRs is associated with depletion of CD40 expressing cells
(Li and Ravetch, 2011). Since human FcγRIIIA, but not FcγRIIA, mediates in vivo depletion
by mAbs (DiLillo and Ravetch, 2015), and the S267E or S267E/L328F mutants are
enhanced for FcγRIIA but not FcγRIIIA affinity, we speculate that the reduced potency of
the CD40 mAb mediated by FcγRIIA-engagement is not the result of depletion of CD40
expressing cells. The mechanism that accounts for this inhibitory effect by FcγRIIA is the
subject of our ongoing studies to determine if the signaling activity of FcγRIIA is required

for this inhibitory effect or if the reduced agonistic activity results from a signaling
independent mechanism.
Histidine (H)/arginine (R) polymorphism at position 131 of FcγRIIA dictates its binding
affinity to IgG2, FcγRIIaH131 has about 5-times higher affinity to IgG2 than FcγRIIaR131
(van Sorge et al., 2003). Due to the inhibitory effect of FcγRIIA on the activity of
CP-870,893, patients carrying the FcγRIIA131H/H genotype may have a reduced response to
CP-870,893 treatment. Our humanized mice carry the FcγRIIA131R/R genotype but an
FcγRIIA131H/H strain is being generated so that the contribution of FcγRIIA allele
polymorphism to the activity of anti-CD40 mAbs can be elucidated.

Author Manuscript

The unique hinge conformation of the human IgG2 isotype has recently reported to enhance
the agonistic activity of CD40 mAbs in an FcγR-independent manner. It was therefore
suggested that the superior agonistic activity observed for CP-870,893 is due to its IgG2
isotype compared the IgG1 isotype of the other agonistic CD40 Abs in clinical evaluations,
ChiLob 7/4 and SGN40. When ChiLob 7/4 and SGN40 were generated as IgG2, they
resulted in enhanced potency compared to their original IgG1 isotype (White et al., 2015). A
drawback of that study is that the mAbs were evaluated only in the presence (or absence) of
mouse FcγRs and their isotype-dependent potency in the correct context of human FcγRs
was not evaluated. Here we demonstrated that using ChiLob 7/4 as IgG2 results in reduced
activity compared to IgG1 in the context of human FcγRs. We further evaluated the activity
of IgG1 vs IgG2 subclasses, including the 2A and 2B forms of IgG2, of both CP-870,893
and ChiLob 7/4 and found that IgG1 is more potent than IgG2 and its activity is FcγRdependent. We therefore conclude that the superior agonistic activity of anti-CD40 human
IgG2 observed in mice is not relevant to its clinical activity in humans. Moreover, the
relatively high potency of CP-870,893 compared to the other CD40 mAbs is not a result to
the IgG2 isotype and is likely the result of the mAb recognition of a unique specific
agonistic epitope. Finally, selective enhancement for FcγRIIb-binding is by far the most
efficient strategy to enhance the potency of CD40 mAb agonism.

Mice

Author Manuscript

FcγRαnull mice have FcγR α chain deletion of Fcgr2b, Fcgr3, and Fcgr4, and are crossed to
FcγRI−/− mice (Barnes et al., 2002). They were generated in a C57BL/6 background and
characterized as previously described (Smith et al., 2012). FcγR humanized mice (FcγRαnull,
hFcγRI+, FcγRIIaR131+, FcγRIIb+, FcγRIIIaF158+, and FcγRIIIb+) generated and extensively
characterized as previously described (Smith et al., 2012). Human CD40 transgenic mice
were generated on a C57BL/6 genetic background by pronuclear injection of linearized
RP11-177B15 bacterial artificial chromosome DNA (Osoegawa et al., 2001) and were mated
with CD40-knockout (“Cd40−/−”) mice (The Jackson Laboratory) to obtain
Cd40−/−huCD40+/+ mice. Cd40−/−huCD40+/+ mice were mated with FcγR humanized mice
to obtain the humanized CD40 and FcγR mice (referred “hCD40/FcγR”). hCD40/hFcRIIB+/

Mice were immunized through i.p. injection with 2 µg of DEC-OVA(mIgG1-D265A)
(produced as previously described by (Li and Ravetch, 2011) in the presence or absence of
10 µg of anti-CD40 IgGs (except of ChiLob IgGs that were used at 40 µg/mice) with one of
the various Fc’s. Seven days later peripheral blood was collected and stained with FITCconjugated anti-CD4, APC-conjugated anti-CD8α and PE-conjugated OVA peptide
SIINFEKL H-2b tetramer (tet-OVA, Beckman Coulter) and analyzed on BD LSRForttesa.
Flow cytometry
Cell populations were defined by the following markers; DC (human: HLADR+BDCA1+CD209+CD3−CD14−CD19−CD59−; mouse: CD11b+CD11c+MHC II+F4/80−),
monocytes (human: CD14+HLA-DR+CD15−; mouse: CD11b+Ly6C+F4/80−CD11c−),

H1N1 immunization

Author Manuscript

Mice were immunized with recombinant influenza H1N1 (Sino Biological Inc.) in the
presence of Alum as adjuvant. After 11 days blood was collected and analyzed for antiinfluenza H1N1-specific IgG using standard ELISA protocol.
SPR

Author Manuscript

All experiments were performed with a Biacore T100 surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
system (Biacore, GE Healthcare), as previously described(Bournazos et al., 2014). Briefly,
experiments were performed at 25 °C in HBS-EP buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4; 150 mM
NaCl; 3.4 mM EDTA; 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20). For the measurement of the affinity of
IgG subclass variants for FcγRs and CD40 recombinant IgGs were immobilized on Series S
CM5 chips by amine coupling and soluble ectodomains of FcγRs or CD40 samples were
injected through flow cells at different concentrations. For some FcγRs, the measurements
were repeated in a reversed orientation while immobilizing the FcγR and injecting soluble
IgGs. Background binding to blank immobilized flow cells was subtracted and affinity
constants were calculated using BIAcore T100 evaluation software (GE Healthcare) using
the 1:1 Langmuir binding model.
SPR-based competition assay
SPR competition experiments were performed on a Biacore T100 instrument using a
running buffer of 10 mM sodium phosphate, 130 mM sodium chloride, 0.05% Tween 20, pH

7.1 at 25°C, on a surface consisting of hCD40-Fc immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip using
standard amine coupling chemistry. Competition for binding to hCD40L-Fc was assessed
using the “dual injection” function in the T100 control software, by injecting molecule 1
(parental antibody or CD40L), immediately followed by the same concentration of molecule
1, or a mixture of molecule 1 plus molecule 2. Binding responses were compared to a
control injection of molecule 2 alone. All experiments were performed using 180 s
association and dissociation times at 30 µl/min. The surface was successfully regenerated
between cycles using two 15s pulses of 10 mM glycine pH 1.5 at a flow rate of 30 µl/min.
CD40 binding ELISA

Author Manuscript

Binding specificity and affinity of IgG subclasses were determined by ELISA using
recombinant CD40 (Sino Biological Inc.). ELISA plates (Nunc) were coated overnight at 4C
with recombinant extracellular domain of human CD40 (1 µg/well). All sequential steps
were performed at room temperature. After being washed, the plates were blocked for 1 hr
with PBS/2% skim milk and were subsequently incubated for 1 h with serially diluted IgGs
(1:3 consecutive dilutions in PBS/2% skim milk). After washing, plates were incubated for 1
hr with HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Detection was
performed using two-component peroxidase substrate kit (KPL) and reactions stopped with
the addition of 1 M phosphoric acid. Absorbance at 405nm was immediately recorded using
a SpectraMax Plus spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices) and background absorbance
from negative control samples was subtracted.
Generation of anti-CD40 Fc variants

Author Manuscript

Anti human CD40 Ab CP-870,893 is clone 21.4.1 mentioned in patent US7338660 (ATCC
accession number PTA-3605). The variable heavy and light regions of CP-870,893 were
synthesized (Genewiz) and cloned into mammalian expression vectors with human IgG1,
human IgG2, or human kappa Fc backbones, as previously described (Li and Ravetch,
2011). For the generation of Fc domain variants of human IgG1 (N297A, S267E, S267E/
L328F, G237D/P238D/P271G /A330R, G237D/P238D/H268D/P271G/A330R) and human
IgG2 (C127S, C232S), site-directed mutagenesis using specific primers was performed
based on the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis Kit II (Agilent Technologies) according
to manufacturer’s instructions. Mutated plasmid sequences were validated by direct
sequencing (Genewiz).

Author Manuscript

Antibodies were generated by transient transfection of HEK293T cells (ATCC), purified
using Protein G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare), dialyzed in PBS, and sterile filtered
(0.22 mm), as previously described (Nimmerjahn et al., 2005). Purity was assessed by SDSPAGE and Coomassie staining, and was estimated to be >90%. Abs used for in vivo
experiments were quantified for endotoxin (LPS) contamination by the Limulus Amebocyte
Lysate (LAL) assay and verified to have levels < 0.1 EU/µg. Polyclonal human IgG was
were purchased from Bio X Cell.
Tumor challenge and treatment
MC38 cells (2 × 106) were implanted subcutaneously and tumor volumes were measured
every 2–3 days with an electronic caliper and reported as volume using the formula (L12 x

L2)/2, whereas L1 is the shortest diameter and L2 is the longest diameter. 7 days after tumor
inoculation, mice were randomized by tumor size (day 0) and received intraperitoneal (i.p)
injection of 200µg (CP-870,893) or 50µg (CD40.1 and CD40.2) anti-CD40 or control IgGs.
For the experiment shown for CP-870,893 Abs, mice received an additional 200 µg of IgG
treatment at days 3. Mice were followed for 20–24 days after treatment onset until the
majority of the untreated control group had to be sacrificed due to Rockefeller University
IACUC limitation for tumor size. For the B16 lung metastasis model, mice were injected
intravenously with 1 × 106 B16-F10 cells and treated with 40µg of the indicated Abs on days
1 and 4 after tumor cell injection. On day 14 lungs were harvested and analyzed for the
presence of surface metastasis foci by using a dissecting microscope.
Statistical Analysis

Author Manuscript

One-way ANOVA with Tukey post-test was used to compare all groups to control groups in
tumor growth experiments. Unpaired two-tailed t test was used when two groups were
compared and to compare groups in experiments assessing cells types percentages. Data
were analyzed with Graphpad Prism software (Graphpad) and p values of < 0.05 were
considered to be statistically significant and indicated as *p≤0.05; **p≤0.01; ***p≤0.001;
ns, non-significant. Asterisks indicate statistical comparison to the control group unless
indicated otherwise on the graphs.

Highlights
-

Wild type mice fail to model the activity of human CD40 IgG subclasses

-

Humanized FcγR/CD40 mice enabled assessment of hFcR contribution to
CD40 mAb activity

-

Binding affinity to FcγRIIB dictates the agonistic activity of human CD40
IgGs

-

CD40 mAbs enhanced for FcγRIIB, but not FcγRIIA, have optimal anti
tumor activity

Author Manuscript

Dahan et al. generate a mouse model fully humanized for FcγRs and CD40. Using this
model, they discover that FcγRIIB-engagement is essential for the antitumor activity of
human CD40 agonistic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), whereas FcγRIIA-engagement is
inhibitory. They use this knowledge to improve these mAbs.

Significance
The use of immunomodulatory mAbs to stimulate effective anticancer immunity has
shown clinical successes for treatment of various cancer types. An approach currently
under clinical development uses agonistic anti-CD40 mAbs to induce antigen presenting
cells (APC) activation, thereby harnessing the potency of the immune response to
eradicate tumors. However, the current mAbs under development have not been
optimized for FcγR-engagement to implement the full potential of these mAbs. Here we
describe a humanized mouse model that evaluates human anti-CD40 mAbs and enables
the selection of optimized next-generation Fc-engineered human mAbs that can be
readily translatable to clinical trials. Our studies also provide a broad rationale for the
development path of therapeutic human antibodies based on their requirement for
selective FcγR-interactions.
