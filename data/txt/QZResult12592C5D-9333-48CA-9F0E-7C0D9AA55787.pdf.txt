Anti–αv Integrin Monoclonal Antibody Intetumumab Enhances
the Efficacy of Radiation Therapy and Reduces Metastasis
of Human Cancer Xenografts in Nude Rats
Shoucheng Ning1, Junqiang Tian1, Deborah J. Marshall2, and Susan J. Knox1

Abstract
We previously reported that intetumumab (CNTO 95), a fully human anti–αv integrin monoclonal antibody,
is a radiosensitizer in mice with xenograft tumors. Because intetumumab does not cross-react with mouse
integrins, but has cross-reactivity with rat integrins, we next studied the potential combined use of radiation
therapy and intetumumab in human cancer xenograft models in nude rats to assess effects on both tumor
cells and the tumor microenvironment. Nude rats bearing human head and neck cancer and non–small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) xenografts were treated with intetumumab and fractionated local tumor radiotherapy.
Effects on tumor growth and metastasis, blood perfusion, oxygenation, and gastrointestinal toxicity were studied. Intetumumab alone had a moderate effect on tumor growth. When combined with fractionated radiation
therapy, intetumumab significantly inhibited tumor growth and produced a tumor response rate that was
significantly better than with radiation therapy alone. Treatment with intetumumab also significantly reduced
lung metastasis in the A549 NSCLC xenograft model. The oxygenation and blood perfusion in xenograft
tumors measured by microbubble-enhanced ultrasound imaging were substantially increased after treatment
with intetumumab. The combined use of intetumumab and radiation therapy reduced the microvessel density
and increased apoptosis in tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment. Toxicity studies showed that treatment with intetumumab did not cause the histopathologic changes in the lungs and did not sensitize the
sensitive gastrointestinal epithelium to the effect of radiation therapy. Intetumumab can potentiate the efficacy
of fractionated radiation therapy in human cancer xenograft tumors in nude rats without increased toxicity.

Introduction
Intetumumab (CNTO 95) is a fully human anti–αv integrin
monoclonal antibody that binds human αv integrin–
expressing cells with high affinity (K d , approximately
1–24 nmol/L) and has limited cross-reactivity with rat αv
integrin (Kd, 220 nmol/L; ref. 1). Preclinical studies have
shown that intetumumab exhibits antiangiogenic and antitumor activity in human cancer xenograft models in nude
mice (1–3). Intetumumab has been reported to inhibit cell
adhesion, migration, invasion, and proliferation of endothelial cells and tumor cells in vitro and tumor metastasis
in vivo in nude mice with human breast cancer xenografts
by inactivating the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the
docking protein paxillin (1, 4). We have previously shown
that intetumumab is a potential radiation sensitizer when

used in combination with fractionated radiation therapy in
human cancer xenograft models in nude mice (5). Data from
two multicenter clinical phase I studies in patients with
advanced solid tumors have shown that intetumumab was
safe and well tolerated either alone or in combination with
docetaxel (6, 7). Intetumumab is now in phase II clinical
trials for the treatment of a variety of malignancies.
Although the specific mechanism of action responsible for
the antitumor activity of intetumumab has been not fully
elucidated, inhibition of tumor angiogenesis via inhibitory
effects on targeted integrins is thought to play an important
role in the inhibition of tumor growth. However, the antitumor and antimetastatic activities of intetumumab observed
in nude mice with human cancer xenografts are most likely
independent of its antiangiogenic activity because intetumumab does not cross-react with mouse αv integrins. In fact, intetumumab was more potent in inhibiting tumor growth in
nude rats than in nude mice with the same human melanoma
xenografts (1). To fully assess the effects of intetumumab on
radiation response of tumors and interaction of tumor cells
and their microenvironments, we next studied the combined
use of intetumumab and fractionated local tumor radiation
therapy in nude rats with human cancer xenograft. Based on
our previous studies (5, 8, 9), we hypothesized that intetumumab would potentiate the efficacy of fractionated radiation

therapy and inhibit tumor metastasis by blocking the function
of adhesion molecules in the microenvironment of potential
metastatic sites.

Materials and Methods
Antibodies
Intetumumab (CNTO 95) was provided by Centocor, Inc.
Intetumumab was diluted in physiologic saline (0.9% sodium
chloride) at a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL for i.p. injection.
Cell culture
Human head and neck cancer cell lines FaDu and non–
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line A549 were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS,
100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin in a
37°C humidified incubator with a mixture of 95% air and
5% CO2. All experiments were performed on exponentially
growing cells with a cell population doubling time of approximately 24 to 36 hours. The identity of cells has regularly
been confirmed throughout the course of the studies by observation of the growth pattern and cell morphology in vitro
and in vivo.
Rat tumor model and therapy
Male nude rats, 5 to 6 weeks old and 150 to 200 g in body
weight, were purchased from Harlan Laboratories. Rats were
tested and found to be negative for specific pathogens. The
rats were normally bred and maintained under specific
pathogen-free conditions, and sterilized food and water were
available ad libitum. Rats were injected s.c. in the right flank
with 5 × 106 tumor cells in a suspension volume of 0.1 mL.
One tumor per rat was inoculated. When tumors reached an
average size of 200 mm3 (150–250 mm3), rats were randomly
assigned to the different treatment groups. Intetumumab
was injected i.p. at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight, once
weekly until completion of the study, or as specified in each
experiment. In combination therapy, intetumumab was injected 30 to 60 minutes before irradiation. For irradiation,
the anesthetized tumor-bearing rats were placed in individual lead boxes with tumors protruding through a cutout window at the rear of each box. The radiation was delivered
using a Philips RT-250 200 kVp X-ray unit (12.5 mA; half-value
layer, 1.0-mm Cu) at a dose rate of 140 cGy/min. Tumors
were locally irradiated with a dose of 250 cGy per fraction
daily for 5 consecutive days. In some experiments, a single
dose of irradiation was used as specified in each experiment.
The length and width of the tumors were measured with
calipers before treatment, and three times a week thereafter
until the tumor volume reached at least four times the pretreatment volume. The tumor volume was calculated using
the formula: tumor volume (mm3) = π/6 × length × width2.
The response of tumors to the treatment is defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease
(SD), and progressive disease (PD). A CR of tumors was
recorded if a tumor completely disappeared and was not
palpable at the end of the experiment (or 30 days after com-

pletion of radiation therapy). A PR was a reduction in volume
of ≥50% compared with the initial tumor volume at the start
of treatment. SD was defined as the tumor size neither PR nor
PD criteria met. PD was an increase in tumor volume of ≥20%
of the pretreatment volume. Body weight of animals was
measured three times a week. The animal experiments
described herein were approved by the Stanford University
Administrative Panel for Laboratory Animal Care.
Lung metastasis models
We studied the lung metastasis of tumors using two different tumor metastasis models: an i.v. injection model and a
s.c. tumor model. In the i.v. injection model, nude rats were
injected with 1 × 106 A549 cells in 0.2-mL Hank's solution via
the lateral tail vein. Immediately after tumor cell injection,
rats were randomly assigned to two groups. One group of
nine rats was injected i.p. with 10 mg/kg intetumumab, once
a week for 60 days. A second group of 10 rats was injected
with physiologic saline (10 mL/kg), once weekly for 60 days.
In the s.c. tumor model, nude rats were inoculated s.c. in
the right flank with 5 × 106 A549 cells, with one tumor site
per rat. When tumors reached an average size of 200 mm3,
rats were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups
and treated as described above in the Rat tumor model and
therapy section. After 60 days, rats were euthanized and the
lungs were immediately removed and fixed in either Bouin's
solution or 10% buffered formalin for counting of pulmonary
metastatic nodules.
Immunohistochemistry analysis
General histopathologic changes, apoptosis, and microvessel density of tumors were assessed by immunohistochemical
staining. Tumor-bearing rats were euthanized 3 days after
treatment for tumor collection with three rats per treatment
regimen. Harvested tumors were immediately frozen in OCT
compound, sectioned at 8-μm thickness, and stained with
H&E for general histopathologic analysis, with an ApopTag
peroxidase in situ oligo ligation (ISOL) apoptosis detection
kit (Chemicon International) for detection of apoptosis,
and with an anti-CD31 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for microvessel density counts. Slides were
counterstained with hematoxylin for background nuclear
visualization. Slides were visualized and photographed using
a Leica DM6000B fluorescence/light microscope (Leica
Microsystems). For quantification of microvessels, tissue sections were analyzed at ×40 magnification and CD31-positive
vessels were counted. Four fields per section were randomly
analyzed, and data are presented as the mean ± SD of three
tumors.
Assessment of tumor hypoxia
Tumor hypoxia was assessed using the hypoxia marker EF5
as previously described (10). Briefly, 3 days after treatment
with a single dose of 10 mg/kg intetumumab or 5 Gy irradiation alone, or in combination, rats bearing FaDu tumors
were injected with 10 mmol/L EF5 solution. Two hours later,
tumors were collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, sectioned,
and stained with anti-EF5 antibody ELK3-51 conjugated with

Cy3. Digital photomicrographs were taken at ×40 magnification with a fluorescence microscope. The Cy3 signal was analyzed with Adobe Photoshop program. The EF5 binding due
to hypoxia was determined by correction for nonspecific and
endogenous binding.
Microbubble-enhanced ultrasound image
Two days after treatment, tumor-bearing rats were imaged
on a Vevo 770 system (VisualSonics, Inc.) with a 40-MHz
transducer. Rats were anesthetized with a 3% isofluraneoxygen mixture, and the body temperature was monitored
and maintained at 37°C on a warming plate during the imaging session. The coupling gel was applied to the skin over the
tumor, and a 12 × 12–mm view field was imaged by twodimensional contrast mode. A baseline image was acquired
before microbubble injection. The contrast-enhanced image
was acquired 5 seconds after a bolus injection of the nontargeted microbubble contrast agent (3 × 108 microbubbles/
0.1 mL) via a tail vein catheter. Images were acquired at
20 frames per second for a total of 800 frames. The image data
were analyzed using Vevo 770 Contrast Mode software by
comparing the contrast cine loop with the baseline cine loop
to generate a contrast overlay to identify the differences in
image intensity between these two loops.
Intestinal crypt stem cell assay
Nude rats were divided into two groups. One group of rats
was injected i.p. with a single dose of 10 mg/kg intetumumab
1 hour before irradiation. Rats were irradiated with a total
body irradiation (TBI) at doses of 10 to 15 Gy. There were
three rats per dose point per group. Three days following
irradiation, rats were euthanized. The duodenum, jejunum,
and ileum were immediately removed and fixed in 10% buffered formalin. The intestinal segments were cut into four
pieces, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with
H&E. Surviving crypts (≥10 cells) for each cross-section were
counted by light microscopy. Each viable crypt is presumed
to contain one or more surviving intestinal crypt stem cells.
Eight cross-sections were scored per segment. The results are
presented as mean crypt cell numbers per cross-section ± SD.
Statistics
Data were statistically analyzed using a two-tailed Student's t test.

Results
Effect of intetumumab on tumor responses to local
fractionated radiation therapy
Nude rats with established FaDu and A549 xenograft tumors were treated with (a) 10 mg/kg intetumumab, once a
week; (b) 250 cGy radiation daily for 5 days; (c) a combination
of intetumumab and radiation as above; or (d) an i.p. injection of normal saline (0.01 mL/g body weight) once weekly as
an untreated control. Data are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1.
Treatment with intetumumab alone, radiotherapy alone, or
in combination inhibited tumor growth and produced complete regression of tumors in both FaDu and A549 tumor

models. The total tumor response rates (CR and PR) were
33%, 67%, and 89% in FaDu tumor model and 17%, 17%,
and 67% in A549 tumor model for intetumumab alone, radiation alone, and combination therapy, respectively. The combination treatment was more effective in inhibiting tumor
growth and resulted in complete regression of tumors in seven
of nine rats with FaDu tumors and four CRs of six rats with
A549 tumors, which was significantly higher than the other
treatment regimens studied (P < 0.05). In addition, tumors
with a PR and no response (SD and PD) to the treatment grew
slower following combined therapy than those treated with
either intetumumab or radiation alone (Fig. 1).
Intetumumab alone or in combination with radiation did
not cause any significant decrease in body weight compared
with untreated control animals (data not shown). There were
no obvious change in the general appearance, skin reaction,
or daily activity of tumor-bearing rats treated with intetumumab either alone or in combination with radiation. H&E
staining of the lungs showed that there were no obvious
changes in histopathology in lungs from rats treated with intetumumab either alone or in combination with radiation
compared with untreated control animals.
Effect of intetumumab on tumor metastasis
Next, we studied the effects of intetumumab on the lung
metastasis of A549 xenograft tumors using an i.v. injection
model for testing the homing ability of lung cancer cells
and a s.c. tumor model for testing the spontaneous metastasis to lung. Data are shown in Fig. 2. There were significant
differences in the number of rats with metastatic lung lesions
and the mean number of metastatic lesions per lung between

the intetumumab-treated group and the untreated control
group. Sixty days after an i.v. injection of A549 cells, 9 of 10
rats developed metastatic lung lesions in the untreated control group, whereas only 4 of 9 rats developed lung metastases in the intetumumab-treated group (P < 0.05). The average
number of metastatic lesion per lung was 56 ± 50 (with a
range of 3–142) in the control group and 13 ± 8 (with a range
of 6–24) in the intetumumab-treated group (P = 0.02).
In the s.c. tumor model, treatment with intetumumab
alone or in combination with local tumor radiation inhibited
spontaneous lung metastasis of A549 tumors and decreased
both the number of rats with lung metastasis and the number
of metastatic lesions per lung (Fig. 2). The average number of
metastatic lesions per lung was 18 ± 9, 6 ± 2, 12 ± 9, and 4 ± 2

group. In combination therapy, intetumumab was injected 30 to 60 min
before irradiation. Points, average tumor volume of each group versus

for groups treated with normal saline (control), intetumumab
alone, radiation alone, and the combination of intetumumab
and radiation, respectively.
Effect of intetumumab on apoptosis, microvasculature,
oxygenation, and blood perfusion of xenograft tumors
To understand the mechanism of action by which intetumumab enhances the efficacy of radiation therapy, we studied
apoptosis, microvessel density, oxygenation, and blood perfusion in xenograft tumors using immunohistochemical staining (Fig. 3) and microbubble-enhanced micro-ultrasound
imaging (Fig. 4).
The apoptotic cell death in tumors was assessed using the
ApopTag peroxidase ISOL apoptosis detection staining. Intetumumab alone did not induce obvious ISOL-positive
apoptotic cell staining. The ISOL-positive apoptotic cells
were much more evident in tumors treated with radiation
either alone or in combination with intetumumab. The mean
number of apoptotic cells per view field was 8 ± 4 for the
untreated control, 9 ± 3 for intetumumab alone, 52 ± 5 for
radiation alone, and 116 ± 12 for the combination of intetumumab and radiation (P < 0.01, combination versus all other
groups), respectively.
CD31 staining showed that intetumumab alone did not
significantly affect the number of CD31-positive microvessel
compared with untreated control tumors (28 ± 2 per field for
control and 25 ± 5 per field for intetumumab alone; P = 0.3),
but morphologically, vessels in intetumumab-treated tumors
were more regular and distributed more uniformly than seen
in untreated control tumors. Radiation therapy reduced the
number of CD31-positive microvessel to 13 ± 2 per field
(a 54% decrease; P = 0.03 versus control). The combination
of radiation and intetumumab further reduced the number
of tumor microvessels to 6 ± 2 per field, representing a
further 54% decrease (P = 0.02 versus radiation alone). Morphologically, the microvessels were much less regular and
shorter and had more closed ends in tumors treated with
radiation, either alone or in combination with intetumumab.
Results of EF5 staining showed that tumors from untreated rats had the highest level of EF5 staining, and tumors
from rats treated with the combination of intetumumab
and radiation had the lowest EF5 staining (i.e., the lowest
level of hypoxia). EF5-stained hypoxic regions were decreased
by 40% in tumors treated with intetumumab alone and by
54% in tumors treated with intetumumab and radiation compared with untreated control tumors (P = 0.01). The quantification of EF5 staining showed that the EF5 signal intensity
was 59 ± 6% that of control tumors in intetumumab-treated
tumors, 72 ± 8% in radiation-treated tumors, and 46 ± 6% in
tumors treated with intetumumab plus radiation.
To further examine whether the reduction of hypoxia was
due to the improvement of blood perfusion in tumors, we
assessed the blood perfusion and blood volume in tumors
using microbubble-enhanced ultrasound imaging. Figure 4
shows signal intensity as a function of image frame (time),
with the slope of the curve representing the relative rate of
blood perfusion and the plateau representing the relative
blood volume in the tumors. Treatment with intetumumab

radiation, there was a dose-dependent decrease in the crypt
stem cells in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum after a single dose of 10 to 15 Gy TBI. Administration of intetumumab
slightly decreased the mean number of surviving crypt cells
at radiation doses above 13 Gy. However, the decrease in the
mean number of crypt cells was not significantly different
when compared with similarly irradiated control rats without intetumumab treatment (P > 0.05).

dramatically increased the rates of blood perfusion and
blood volume of tumors. Radiation alone did not increase
the perfusion rate. When combined with intetumumab, the
perfusion rate and blood volume in tumors were significantly
enhanced.
Meanwhile, H&E staining revealed many more large and
diffuse areas of necrosis in tumors treated with radiation, either alone or in combination with intetumumab. There was
no apparent difference in the H&E staining of intetumumabtreated tumors and untreated control tumors.

Discussion

Effect of intetumumab on the sensitivity of intestinal
crypt stem cells to radiation—gastrointestinal
toxicity study
Gastrointestinal toxicity caused by radiation limits the
therapeutic dose that can be used for treating abdominal
and pelvic tumors with radiation therapy. This toxicity is
primarily due to the killing of the crypt stem cells in the
intestinal epithelium. We performed experiments to study
the effect of intetumumab on irradiated intestinal crypt cell
survival. The results are shown in Fig. 5. Intetumumab alone
had no effect on crypt cell growth and proliferation. For

We previously reported that intetumumab sensitized human xenograft tumors to radiation in mice (5). Intetumumab
does not bind to mouse αv integrins, so this observed effect
was due to direct effects of the antibody on the tumor cells,
as well as to possible indirect effects of the intetumumabtreated tumor cells on the surrounding vasculature and
microenvironment. Therefore, the use of mouse models for
these studies was suboptimal because they did not allow
for assessment of the direct effect of the antibody on both
tumors and tumor vasculature in the tumor microenvironment when combined with radiation. Intetumumab does

cross-react with rat integrins, so to better study the combined effect of intetumumab and radiation in a more clinically relevant model, we used nude rats with well-established
human head and neck cancer and NSCLC xenograft tumors
for efficacy, toxicity, metastasis, and mechanistic studies.
Intetumumab significantly enhanced the efficacy of radiation in both human head and neck cancer FaDu and NSCLC
A549 tumor models. The magnitude of sensitization was
greater in these rat models than previously observed with
the mouse tumor models, as evidenced by the higher tumor
response rates. Although the tumor xenograft models studied
in mice and rats differed, we did not previously observe any
complete regressions of tumors from four different tumor
models studied in mice, including a head and neck tumor
model, treated with more frequent dosing of intetumumab
(10 mg/kg, three doses per week in mice compared with
weekly dose in rats). This was not surprising because in
the rat tumor models, the antibody was able to bind to both
αv integrin–expressing tumor cells and vascular endothelial
cells, and exert direct effects on both.
A variety of mechanistic studies were performed to further
elucidate the underlying mechanism of this effect. Microves-

sels in intetumumab-treated tumors were morphologically
more regular and relatively uniformly distributed within
the tumors. The combination of intetumumab and radiation
resulted in a significant decrease in the microvessel density
compared with radiation alone and was associated with morphologic changes indicative of altered vascular function.
There was also a correlation between microvessel density
and the level of apoptosis in treated tumors. EF5 staining
of hypoxic cells was decreased by 40% in tumors treated with
intetumumab alone and reduced by 54% in tumors treated
with intetumumab plus radiation. Furthermore, microbubbleenhanced ultrasound imaging showed that intetumumab
markedly increased tumor blood volume and perfusion rates,
which were further enhanced, but to a lesser extent, by combining intetumumab with radiation. Jain (11) has reported
that antiangiogenic agents can transiently normalize tumor
vasculature and that this effect may be secondarily associated with changes in tumor perfusion and oxygenation. We
hypothesize that intetumumab had a similar effect, which is
also consistent with results from studies of a variety of other
antiangiogenic agents that have been reported to affect microvessel density, morphology, and function and to enhance

tumor responses to radiation (5, 12, 13). Our previous study
has shown that treatment with intetumumab inhibited the
expression of the angiogenic marker vascular endothelial
growth factor receptor in vascular endothelial cells as well
as in tumor cells (5). Radiation, on the other hand, not only
kills tumor cells and endothelial cells in tumors but also
induces and activates the expression of a variety of proangiogenic and prosurvival factors. Treatment with intetumumab
in combination with radiation could inhibit the radiationinduced overexpression of proangiogenic factors and angiogenesis in tumors. Taken together, these results suggest that
intetumumab inhibited angiogenesis, normalized the microvessel morphology, increased the tumor perfusion rate and
blood volume, and increased oxygenation, all of which were
further enhanced by radiation, resulting in decreased tumor
hypoxia/increased tumor pO2 and, over time, in increased
damage to the tumor microvasculature and increased tumor
cell killing.
Although the antiangiogenic and radiosensitizing effects
of intetumumab are not unique, intetumumab has the added
advantage over many other antiangiogenic agents in development, such as inhibiting the development of metastases
by targeting the αv integrin receptors and blocking its
downstream cell adhesion signaling pathway (4). Here, we
further show the ability of intetumumab to inhibit the subsequent development of pulmonary metastases in the
NSCLC A549 model following either i.v. administration of
tumor cells or spontaneous metastasis from established s.c.
tumors. Metastasis of a primary tumor to distant sites is a
complicated multistep process, involving dissociation of tumor cells from the original tumors, epithelial-mesenchymal
transition, breach of the basement membrane, invasion of
the extracellular matrix tissues, intravasation into preexisting and newly formed blood and lymph vessels (angiogenesis
and lymphangiogenesis), transport through and extrava-

sation from vessels, invasion, adhesion, establishment of disseminated cells at a secondary distant site, and proliferation
(reviewed in refs. 14, 15). At each step, there are one or more
physiologic barriers to the metastasis of tumor cells, such as
anoikis, a type of cell death due to detachment or loss of cell
adhesion. Studies have shown that integrins play a pivotal
role in many steps of this metastatic process, especially in
dissociation, invasion, adhesion, proliferation, and angiogenesis in both primary and distant secondary sites (16–20).
Integrins, as the key cell surface receptors for cell-cell and
cell–extracellular matrix interactions, sense and initiate the
signaling of cell motility, invasion, and adhesion; interact
with receptor tyrosine kinases; and activate downstream signaling of FAK and SRC family kinases (21). Treatment with
intetumumab inactivates the FAK and paxillin docking protein by tyrosine dephosphorylation of the tyrosine residues,
followed by the inhibition of invasion and motility of
tumor cells in vitro (4). Furthermore, intetumumab has been
reported to be more potent at inhibiting cell adhesion, motility, and invasion than other anti–αv-containing integrin
antibodies, RGD mimetics, and small molecules (1, 4). Interaction of tumor cells with extracellular matrix via adhesion
molecules is important for survival and metastasis of tumors and may play a pivotal role in resistance to radiation
therapy (22, 23). In addition, the relative radioresistance of
stem or stem-like metastatic tumor cells is an important
clinical problem (24, 25) and contributes to the failure of
conventional cytotoxic therapies. Therefore, one can hypothesize that intetumumab could both block homing of tumor
cells to potential metastatic sites and radiosensitize these
cells. These properties of intetumumab could potentially
inhibit metastasis and facilitate eradication of these resistant tumor subpopulations by radiation, thereby increasing
the efficacy of local tumor radiation therapy via multiple
mechanisms.

Agents that enhance the efficacy of radiation therapy
are only beneficial if they do not similarly sensitize normal
tissue to radiation therapy. Using the intestinal crypt cell
assay, we were able to show that intetumumab alone had
no detectable cytotoxic effect on crypt cell numbers or morphology and had no significant effect on the sensitivity of
the crypt cells to radiation. This is very important because
crypt cells are very radiosensitive, and the sensitivity of the
intestines and rectum to radiation limits the dose of radiation that can safely be used to treat abdominal and pelvic
tumors. In addition, there were no apparent histopathologic
changes in lungs from rats treated with intetumumab either
alone or in combination with radiation compared with
untreated rats. Intetumumab was very well tolerated by the
rats, with no significant weight loss or observable signs of
toxicity when used alone or in combination with radiation
therapy. It should be pointed out that there is a ubiquitous
expression of αv integrins in normal tissues, and the binding
of intetumumab to human αv integrins is greater than in
rats. Therefore, caution should be used in extrapolating these
safety and toxicity data from rats to human patients. However, data from a preclinical toxicity study in cynomolgus

macaques showed that treatment with intetumumab produced no sign of toxicity and no histopathologic changes
in any of the tissues examined (2). Data from two recently
completed phase I clinical trials (6, 7) further showed that
intetumumab was generally safe and well tolerated either
alone or in combination with docetaxel in 6-week or prolonged treatment regimens. There were no dose-limiting toxicities reported in these studies.
In summary, these results are very encouraging and show
that intetumumab can potentiate the efficacy of fractionated
radiation therapy and inhibit metastasis in rats with human
cancer xenograft tumors, without enhancing effects of radiation on intestinal crypt cells (normal tissue toxicity). These
findings may have near-term translational potential for the
treatment of solid tumors in patients using radiation therapy.
