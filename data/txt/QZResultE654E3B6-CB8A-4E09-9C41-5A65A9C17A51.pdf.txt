ABSTRACT:
The c-Kit receptor tyrosine kinase is commonly over-expressed in different types
of cancer. p53 activation is known to result in the down-regulation of c-Kit. However,
the underlying mechanism has remained unknown. Here, we show that the p53induced miR-34 microRNA family mediates repression of c-Kit by p53 via a conserved
seed-matching sequence in the c-Kit 3’-UTR. Ectopic miR-34a resulted in a decrease
in Erk signaling and transformation, which was dependent on the down-regulation
of c-Kit expression. Furthermore, ectopic expression of c-Kit conferred resistance
of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells to treatment with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), whereas
ectopic miR-34a sensitized the cells to 5-FU. After stimulation with c-Kit ligand/
stem cell factor (SCF) Colo320 CRC cells displayed increased migration/invasion,
whereas ectopic miR-34a inhibited SCF-induced migration/invasion. Activation of
a conditional c-Kit allele induced several stemness markers in DLD-1 CRC cells. In
primary CRC samples elevated c-Kit expression also showed a positive correlation
with markers of stemness, such as Lgr5, CD44, OLFM4, BMI-1 and β-catenin. On
the contrary, activation of a conditional miR-34a allele in DLD-1 cells diminished
the expression of c-Kit and several stemness markers (CD44, Lgr5 and BMI-1) and
suppressed sphere formation. miR-34a also suppressed enhanced sphere-formation
after exposure to SCF. Taken together, our data establish c-Kit as a new direct target
of miR-34 and demonstrate that this regulation interferes with several c-Kit-mediated
effects on cancer cells. Therefore, this regulation may be potentially relevant for
future diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

INTRODUCTION

the intracellular domain of the receptor, which activates
several signaling cascades [3]. Among these are the PI-3,
Src, Jak/Stat, and MAP kinase induced pathways, as well
as phospholipase C and D mediated signaling [4]. c-Kit
exerts numerous functions in hematopoiesis, pigmentation,
and gametogenesis and is involved in T-cell differentiation
and mast cell regulation as well [4-8]. Deregulated
expression and activation of c-Kit contributes to several
types of diseases among them cancer [4]. For example,
the c-Kit signaling axis is involved in leukemia [9, 10],
glioblastoma [11], melanoma [12, 13], lung [14, 15] and
breast cancer [16]. However, the role of c-Kit expression

c-Kit, which is also known as CD117 or stem
cell factor receptor, is a type III receptor tyrosine
kinase (RTK) and an important mediator/initiator of
several signaling cascades. The c-Kit gene was initially
identified as the cellular homolog of v-kit, the oncogene
of the Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma virus [1,2].
Binding of its ligand stem cell factor (SCF, also known
as steel factor) leads to receptor homodimerization and

RESULTS

in colorectal cancer (CRC) is still largely unknown (see
also discussion). Aberrant activation of c-Kit is associated
with diminished chemo-responsiveness/chemoresistance
of cancer cells and increased oncogenic signaling (e.g. in
gastrointestinal stromal tumors [GISTs]) presumably by
mediating an escape from apoptotic triggers [17-21]. The
ligand of c-Kit, SCF/stem cell factor, is often expressed
at elevated levels in tumor cells as well and contributes to
the autocrine/paracrine transmission of oncogenic signals
[22-25].
Interestingly, the microRNAs (miRNAs) miR193a, -193b, -221, -222 and -494 are known to repress
the expression of c-Kit by directly targeting its mRNA
[26-29]. MiRNAs are small non-protein-coding RNAs of
~20-25 nucleotides length, which repress target mRNAs
by binding to their 3’-untranslated regions (3’-UTRs) [30].
The p53 tumor suppressor gene encodes a
transcription factor, which is activated by numerous
cellular stresses, which generally lead to DNA damage
[31]. Interestingly, a p53-dependent down-regulation
of c-Kit expression has been observed in mice, which
occurred in the absence of direct binding of p53 to the
c-Kit promoter [32]. Recently, microRNAs have been
implicated in the repression of genes by p53 [33]. Among
the most prominently p53-induced miRNAs, are the
members of the miR-34 family: miR-34a, miR-34b and
miR-34c, which are encoded by two different genes [34].
miR-34a/b/c were found to mediate several different tumor
suppressive activities of p53, e.g. cell cycle arrest, as
well as inhibition of stemness, induced pluripotent stemcells (IPS), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)/
metastasis and metabolism [33]. In addition, miR-34 genes
may also be involved in other physiological processes, as
for example in aging of the heart [35].
Here we report that miR-34 directly targets the
c-Kit mRNA and thereby mediates repression of c-Kit
expression by p53. Accordingly, miR-34 activation
negatively regulated c-Kit mediated signaling events
and cell transformation. Furthermore, miR-34a-mediated
chemosensitization was accompanied by down-regulation
of c-Kit. In addition, SCF-induced migration and invasion
was abrogated by ectopic miR-34. Ectopic expression of
c-Kit in CRC lines enhanced the expression of numerous
markers of stemness, which was in agreement with an
association of elevated c-Kit expression in primary CRC
tumors and the expression of stemness markers, such
as OLFM4, LGR5, BMI-1 and CD44, whereas ectopic
expression of miR-34 significantly reduced the expression
of CD44, Lgr5 and BMI-1. An enhancement of stemness
by SCF was blocked by ectopic expression of miR-34a.
Taken together, our results show that the regulation of
c-Kit by miR-34 may critically contribute to the tumor
suppressive effects of miR-34, and therefore p53, in CRC
and other tumor entities.

c-Kit is regulated in a p53-dependent manner in
colorectal cancer cell lines
Since a recent study reported a p53-dependent
regulation of c-Kit, which occurred in the absence of
p53 binding to the c-Kit promoter in mice [32], we
hypothesized that miR-34 could be the mediator of this
effect. In order to investigate this putative connection
we used two different systems to conditionally express
p53: SW480 cell pools transfected with the doxycycline
(DOX) - inducible vector pRTR expressing the p53
open reading frame (ORF) and a DLD-1 single cell
clone harboring a p53 allele under control of the tetoff system [36, 37]. Although the endogenous levels of
c-Kit were lower in SW480 cells than in DLD-1 cells,
activation of p53 in both cellular systems resulted in the
down-regulation of c-Kit protein expression (Figure 1A).
Since miRNAs were shown to mediate gene repression
by p53 we examined the c-Kit 3’-UTR using the TargetScan algorithm [38]. Thereby we identified two potential
miR-34 seed-matching sequences in the 3’-UTR of
c-Kit (Figure 1B). While the first site (which is a perfect
match to the miR-34a 8-mer seed-matching sequence) is
relatively conserved among different species, the second
site seems to be less conserved. In line with previous
reports, expression of the primary miR-34a transcript
was induced and the c-Kit mRNA was repressed after
p53 activation in both SW480 and DLD-1 cells (Figure
1C). Since the expression of miR-34b and miR-34c is
at least 100 fold lower than that of miR-34a [39-41] in
CRC cells and cell lines we focused our further studies
on miR-34a. Notably, the ectopic expression of miR-34a
driven by a conditional, episomal vector was sufficient to
reduce c-Kit expression at the mRNA and protein levels
in SW480 and DLD-1 cells (Figure 1D and 1E). Similar
results were obtained with the CRC cell line HCT15
harboring the same miR-34 expression vector, though
miR-34a mediated regulation was not as pronounced
as in the other two cell lines (Supplemental Figure 1A
and B). In order to determine whether miR-34 directly
binds to the seed-matching sequences mentioned above
we placed the c-Kit 3’-UTR (including the two potential
binding sites) downstream of a luciferase open reading
frame (Figure 2A). In a dual-reporter luciferase assay
miR-34a as well as miR-34b and c significantly decreased
the activity of this reporter (Figure 2B). When the seedmatching sequence in site 1 was mutated, the reporter
was resistant to down-regulation by miR-34a, whereas
mutation of site 2 did not affect the miR-34-mediated
down-regulation of the reporter. Mutation of both sites
led to resistance against miR-34a regulation. These results
indicate that the miR-34 family directly targets the c-Kit

3’-UTR via site 1. This result is in accordance with the
higher degree of conservation of site 1 when compared
to site 2. Furthermore, p53-mediated down-regulation of
c-Kit in DLD-1 cells could be prevented by simultaneous
transfection of an antagomiR directed against miR-34a

(anti-miR-34a), while additionally transfected miR-34a
further enhanced the repression of c-Kit when p53 was
activated concomitantly (Figure 2C). Taken together, miR34a therefore mediates the repressive effects of p53 on
c-Kit expression by directly targeting the c-Kit 3’-UTR via

signaling, which is known to be activated by c-Kit. Indeed,
the levels of phosphorylated Erk were decreased following
the induction of ectopic miR-34a expression in DLD-1
cells, which was accompanied by a reduction in the levels
of c-Kit protein, whereas the total amount of Erk protein
levels was not affected (Figure 3A). Next, we determined
whether the miR-34a-mediated decrease in Erk-

formation by down-regulation of c-Kit

phosphorylation was dependent on the down-regulation
of c-Kit. Therefore, we generated pools of DLD-1 and
SW480 cells carrying a conditional expression vector for
c-Kit lacking its original 3’-UTR and therefore a miR-34
seed matching sequence. Ectopic miR-34a expression
resulted in decreased levels of Erk-phosphorylation in both
cell lines, while the control oligo had no effect (Figure
3B). Notably, induction of ectopic c-Kit largely reversed
the effect of miR-34a on phosphorylated Erk, whereas the
amount of total Erk was not affected. Collectively, these
results show that the down-regulation of c-Kit is necessary
for the inhibitory effects of miR-34a on mitogenic Erk
signaling.
To test whether these regulations would affect the
capacity of SW480 cells to grow in soft agar, which is
known to be affected by Erk-signaling [42], cells treated
as in Figure 3B were seeded into soft agar and colony
formation was measured (Figure 3C). Indeed, miR-34a
transfection severely reduced the number of colonies.
Furthermore, induction of ectopic c-Kit expression led to
a slight but significant increase in the number of colonies,

at least partially reflecting the results observed on the level
of Erk phosphorylation. Therefore, signaling downstream
of c-Kit contributes to colony formation and can be
suppressed by miR-34a via down-regulation of the c-Kit
receptor expression. We also analyzed the expression of
the EMT marker genes E-cadherin and Vimentin as well
as the primary transcript of miR-34a upon ectopic c-Kit
expression in DLD-1 and SW480 cells (Supplemental
Figure 1C and D). We did not detect any significant
changes of these mRNAs, although recent publications
implied a role of c-Kit in EMT [43, 44].

The interplay between miR-34a and c-Kit
influences chemo-sensitivity
Recently, c-Kit was shown to mediate chemoresistance in ovarian tumor initiating cells [19]. Therefore,
we asked whether c-Kit might play a similar role in
colorectal cancer. To address this issue DLD-1 cells, which
express high levels of endogenous c-Kit, and SW480 cells

expressing low levels of c-Kit were compared (Figure
4A). After treatment of both cell lines with either the
anti-metabolite 5-FU or the anthracycline antibiotic
Doxorubicin for 48 hours, SW480 cells showed a more
pronounced apoptotic response to the treatment with
both chemo-therapeutics, as determined by DNA content
analysis using flow-cytometry, than DLD-1 cells (Figure
4B): upon treatment with the 5-FU the apoptotic sub-G1
fraction of cells was elevated about five times (from five
to 25 %) in SW480 cells, while it tripled in DLD-1 cells
(from three to nine %). Similar results were observed
with Doxorubicin treatment: while SW480 cells showed
a 10 fold increase (from three to 31 %) of apoptosis,
apoptosis in DLD-1 cells increased about 3.5 fold (2 to
7 %). Consistently, the rate of spontaneous apoptosis in
untreated cells was higher in SW480 cells than in DLD-1
cells, which therefore also inversely correlated with the
level of c-Kit expression.
In order to determine whether the relative chemoresistance of DLD-1 cells is based on high levels of c-Kit
and can therefore be influenced by miR-34a, DLD-1 cells
were transfected with miR-34a or control oligos for 24
hours to achieve c-Kit down-regulation. Thereafter, cells
were treated with either 5-FU or left untreated and the

cell index was measured continuously over two days by
real-time impedance measurements. Cells transfected with
the control oligo appeared unaffected and transfection
with miR-34a resulted in a lower cell index over time
(Figure 4C). Treatment with 5-FU affected the survival
of cells even stronger but the most drastic effect resulted
from the combined treatment with miR-34a and 5-FU. As
expected, ectopic miR-34a resulted in a severe decrease
of c-Kit protein levels in DLD-1 cells, whereas the control
oligonucleotide did not influence expression of c-Kit
protein (Figure 4D). Taken together, these results show
that high levels of c-Kit promote chemo-resistance of
CRC cells to 5-FU and Doxorubicin, respectively. This is
probably due to reduction of the apoptotic response. miR34a can inhibit this effect via down-regulation of c-Kit and
therefore sensitize cells to chemotherapeutic treatment.

Disruption of the SCF/c-Kit axis by miR-34a
inhibits migration and invasion
Another function of the SCF/c-Kit axis is an
enhancement of migration, which was previously observed
after treatment of the CRC cell line Colo320 with SCF
[45]. Therefore, we analyzed whether transfection of

Colo320 cells with miR-34a may interfere with the
effects of SCF. First, regulation of c-Kit by miR-34a was
confirmed on mRNA and protein level (Figure 5A and B).
As expected, transfection of Colo320 cells with miR-34a
oligonucleotides for 48 hours led to a decrease of c-Kit on
the mRNA and protein levels. As determined by a modified
Boyden chamber assay, the ectopic expression of miR34a resulted in a decrease in cell migration (Figure 5C).
Conversely, when cells were treated with SCF, the number
of migrating cells doubled, confirming results described by
Yusada et al. [45]. Combined treatment of Colo320 cells
with SCF and miR-34a mimetics significantly reduced
migration approximately to the levels observed in the
controls. miR-34a had similar inhibitory effects on basal
invasion and SCF-induced invasion of Colo320 cells
(Figure 5D). A likely explanation for these effects is that
miR-34a interferes with SCF signaling by suppressing the
expression of the c-Kit receptor which could render cells
refractory to SCF.
Interestingly, we observed no change in the
expression of EMT markers (Vimentin, CDH1, Occludin
and Fibronectin) in Colo320 cells after ectopic miR-34a
expression (Supplemental Figure 1E). This suggests that

the underlying mechanism is not related to the induction of
MET by miR-34a, which was previously shown to occur
in CRC cells [36]. Also expression of pri-miR-34a was not
affected by c-Kit activation, excluding the presence of a
feed-back loop, which was recently described for miR-34
and its target Snail [36].

Association of c-Kit with markers of CRC
stemness
Since SCF is involved in the regulation of
hematopoietic stem cells [46] and recent studies indicated
a role for c-Kit in stemness in ovarian cancer [19], we
asked whether c-Kit influences the expression of stemness
markers in colorectal cancer cells. Therefore, c-Kit was
ectopically expressed in DLD-1 cells and changes in
mRNA expression were determined by qPCR. As positive
controls for c-Kit-mediated gene regulations, expression
of its downstream effectors c-Fos and Oncostatin M [47,
48], was analyzed. As markers for CRC stemness the
expression of CD44, CD133, Lgr5, Nanog, Nanog P8,
β-catenin, Sox2, BMI-1 and OLFM4 was determined [49-

analyzed (Figure 6B). From these analyses, the expression
of OLFM4, CD44, β-catenin, BMI-1 and Lgr5 mRNA
emerged as significantly associated with elevated c-Kit
mRNA expression (p ≤ 0.05). Additionally, elevated c-Kit
ligand (SCF/stem cell factor) expression correlated with
high receptor expression. This confirms previous results
describing a co-expression of receptor and ligand [22-25].
Collectively, these associations suggest that c-Kit or/and
presumably factors regulating c-Kit, as miR-34, might
play a role in the regulation of stemness in colorectal
cancer.

53]. As expected, c-Fos and Oncostatin M were induced
after c-Kit activation (Figure 6A). Besides CD44 and
BMI-1, all analyzed stemness markers were significantly
up-regulated by c-Kit. CD44 was repressed and BMI1 remained unchanged. These results indicate that c-Kit
might enhance stemness of colorectal cancer cells. Next,
we determined whether an association between c-Kit
and stemness markers may also be present in clinical
samples obtained from CRC patients as well. Therefore,
expression data of 196 colorectal tumors from the public
database TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas, [54]) was

miR-34 interferes with SCF-induced stemness

significantly stimulated sphere-formation of DLD-1 cells.
In contrast, treatment with miR-34a oligonucleotides
reduced the number of spheres and also suppressed SCFinduced sphere formation of DLD-1 cells (Figure 7B and
C). These effects were consistently observed over two
consecutive generations. Taken together, these results
show that miR-34a suppresses sphere formation and
therefore stemness of colorectal cancer cells by targeting
c-Kit.

To investigate whether miR-34a-dependent
regulation of c-Kit might affect c-Kit-induced stemness
markers, miR-34a was ectopically expressed in DLD-1
cells by activation of a conditional pRTR-pri-miR-34a
vector (Figure 7A). The mRNA levels of c-Kit and its
published downstream effectors c-Fos and Oncostatin M
were repressed upon activation of miR-34a expression.
However, mRNAs representing stemness markers
displayed relatively weak down-regulations upon
induction of miR-34a. In order to determine whether these
regulations are relevant for stemness-related properties on
the cellular level, DLD-1 cells were subjected to a sphere
formation assay (Figure 7B). This assay in which cells
grow in suspension under non-adherent conditions can
be used to evaluate self-renewing capacities of cancer
stem cells and has been applied previously for analyzing
the effect of miR-34 on gastric cancer stem cells [55]. In
line with previous publications [56] treatment with SCF

DISCUSSION
In this study c-Kit was identified as a new target of
the miR-34 family. Since c-Kit plays a role in numerous
cancer-associated pathways, these results extend the
tumor suppressive mechanisms of miR-34. A model
summarizing our findings is shown in Figure 8. miR-34mediated down-regulation of c-Kit resulted in diminished
Erk-phosphorylation levels, which was associated with
decreased colony formation in soft agar and therefore

a decrease in cellular transformation. Moreover, low
endogenous c-Kit protein levels or a decrease in
c-Kit caused by ectopic miR-34 were associated with
increased chemosensitivity. Furthermore, miR-34a
inhibited migration and invasion and also SCF-mediated
enhancement of these processes was blocked by miR34a. Finally, activation of c-Kit induced several stemness
markers in CRC cell lines and was associated with their
expression in primary CRC tumors, whereas activation of
miR-34a in CRC cell lines resulted in a down-regulation of
c-Kit and c-Kit-induced markers, and suppressed sphereformation of CRC cells, indicating that CRC stemness
may be controlled by the miR-34/c-Kit axis.
Our studies were mainly carried out in colorectal
cancer cells, which have been previously shown to express
c-Kit [17, 45]. However, the role of c-Kit in patients with
colorectal cancer is unclear and former studies described
divergent results: Friedrichs et al found elevated c-Kit
expression to be rare (17.1%) in colorectal carcinomas
[57], which was in accordance with other studies which
found c-Kit to be expressed at very low levels in colorectal
cancer samples using different techniques [58, 59].
Further studies found c-Kit expression in 59% of stage
II colorectal cancer patients [60], in 90% of normal colon
mucosa and 30% of neoplastic tissues [61] and in 15% of
primary colorectal tumors and 14% of distant metastases
[62]. Though these results in patients are not uniform,
c-Kit presumably has a function in colorectal cancer cells
since the c-Kit receptor as well as its ligand are expressed
at elevated levels in colorectal cancer cell lines [63]. In
support of this, SCF stimulates anchorage independent
growth in four out of five CRC cell lines [56] and
increases migration of CRC cell lines [45]. Furthermore,
aberrant activation of the c-Kit axis suppresses apoptosis
and stimulates invasion of DLD-1 colorectal cancer cells
[17].

We could show that miR-34a antagonizes SCF,
presumably by targeting c-Kit and therefore interrupting
the signaling pathways down-stream of c-Kit which are
responsible for the changes in cell behavior. Noteworthy,
ectopic c-Kit did not affect the expression of EMT
markers, such as CDH1/E-cadherin or Vimentin. This was
surprising, since previous publications have linked c-Kit
with EMT, which is an important step in the metastatic
cascade [43].
Our results indicate that c-Kit expression is
associated with chemo-resistance, which can be partially
reverted by ectopic miR-34a. This is reminiscent of the
effect of Imatinib (STI571), which also targets c-Kit
and was shown to be therapeutically effective against
gastrointestinal stromal tumors/GIST [64, 65]. Imatinib
renders DLD-1 cells, which express high c-Kit levels,
more responsive to the cytotoxic effect of 5-FU [66].
Therefore, the additive effect of c-Kit inhibition and
5-FU has precedence and should be studied further,
since this would potentially allow to reduce the dose
of chemotherapeutic compounds in the future. miR34 mimetics were previously shown to sensitize cells
belonging to other tumor entities, such as breast, prostate,
gastric and lung cancer towards chemotherapy [6770]. Therefore, miR-34 mimetics represent promising
candidates for clinical applications [71].
Furthermore, we found that c-Kit activation
results in the up-regulation of several stemness markers
in colorectal cancer cells and primary tumors. This is
in accordance with previous findings, which show that
colorectal cancer stem cells display increased resistance
towards chemotherapeutics such as 5-FU [72, 73]. c-Kit
was suggested to activate ABCG2 drug transporters to
confer chemoresistance in ovarian cancer [19] which
might explain why stem cells are resistant to a variety of
agents, rather than to one single chemotherapeutic agent

Figure 8: The p53/miR-34/c-Kit axis. The model depicts multiple tumor suppressive effects of miR-34a directly targeting c-Kit
which were identified in this study. In tumors, p53 mutation/inactivation or CpG methylation of miR-34a/b/c promoters may abrogate this
pathway [33, 91, 92]. miR-34a/b/c have multiple other targets besides c-Kit [33, 93]. The model was adapted from [94].

expression vector pRTR [87] using Fugene6 (Roche).
Polyclonal cell pools were generated by selection with
puromycin (2 µg/ml) for 10 days. The percentage of GFPpositive cells was determined 72 hours after addition of
doxycycline (DOX) at a final concentration 100 ng/ml.
Transfection of cells with antagomiRs, pre-miRNAs/
mimics and respective negative controls (Ambion)
was performed using HiPerfect (Qiagen) at a final
oligonucleotide concentration of 50 nM. Treatment of cells
with 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU, Sigma-Aldrich) was conducted
at a concentration of 20 µg/ml, while Doxorubicin (SigmaAldrich) was used at a concentration of 0.25 µg/ml. 5-FU,
a pyrimidine analog and anti-metabolite [88] trademarked
as Efudex, and the anthracycline antibiotic Doxorubicin
[89] are often used for chemotherapy. SCF (ImmunoTools)
was used at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml.

Interestingly, previous publications revealed that
miR-221 and 222 regulate angiogenic processes via
targeting c-Kit [74]. Since miR-34a targets c-Kit as well,
effects of p53 on tumor-angiogenesis may be mediated, at
least in part, via miR-34.
Recently, other RTKs were identified as targets of
miR-34, for example Axl, c-Met, PDGFR α and β [49,
55, 75, 76], suggesting a coordinated inhibition of RTKs
by miR-34. According to the microRNA target prediction
algorithms targetSCAN and Miranda [72, 73], most of the
potential miR-34-regulated RTKs cluster in class III [50],
among them PDGFR α, PDGFR β and c-Kit.
Since both, miR-34a and c-Kit interact with
numerous signaling pathways, more detailed analyses are
necessary in order to illuminate the different aspects and
consequences of this regulation. For instance activation
of c-Kit is not only associated with cancer but seems to
play a role in allergic asthma as well [6]. Recently, miR34a was shown to interfere with mTOR signaling pathway
and thereby to play a role in mast cell survival – a process
critical in allergic disorders [77]. Moreover, TGF- β was
reported to suppress miR-34 thereby leading to secretion
of the chemokine CCL22, which is a direct target of
miR-34 and recruitment of regulatory T cells [78]. These
findings place miR-34 in the context of allergic disorders
and miR-34-dependent down-regulation of c-Kit might
therefore be important for understanding and treating these
diseases as well. Interestingly, inhibition of different RTKs
and particularly c-Kit seems to affect asthma [79, 80], via
decreasing histamine levels, infiltration of mast cells and
eosinophils, interleukin-4 production and airway hyperresponsiveness [81].
Replacement therapy with miR-34a mimetics was
successful in several preclinical studies using mouse
models of cancer and may therefore represent a therapeutic
option for the treatment of several tumor entities in the
future [82-86]. Our results indicate that c-Kit may be upregulated in tumors due to inactivation of miR-34 either
by CpG methylation or p53 mutations/inhibition. Such
tumors may be especially sensitive to a replacement of
miR-34 using mimetics.

Western Blot Analysis
SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed
according to standard protocols. Cells were lysed in RIPA
lysis buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 1%
NP40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium
dodecylsulfate, complete mini protease inhibitors (Roche)
and PhosSTOP Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets
(Roche)). Lysates were sonicated and centrifuged at
16.060 g for 20 min at 4°C. Per lane 60 - 100 µg of whole
cell lysate was separated using 7.5% SDS-acrylamide
gels and transferred on Immobilon PVDF membranes
(Millipore). ECL signals were recorded using a CF440
Imager (Kodak). Antibodies used for detection of the
indicated proteins are shown in Supplemental Table 1.

Generation of a c-Kit expression vector
The vector pWPTet containing the coding sequence
of human c-Kit was kindly provided by Matthias
Mayerhofer. The coding sequence was excised using
BamHI and SpeI, cloned into the shuttle vector pUC19SfiI
and ligated into pRTR, respectively via the SfiI sites. The
sequence was verified by sequencing. The generation
of pRTR vectors containing p53 and pri-miR-34a was
described previously [52]. A list of all plasmids used in
this paper is provided in Supplemental Table 2.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and treatments

Flow cytometric analysis of DNA content/
apoptosis and GFP/RFP expression

The colorectal cancer cell lines SW480 and DLD-1
were kept in DMEM and McCoy’s medium, respectively.
Colo320 and HCT15 cells were kept in RPMI medium.
If not indicated differently, all media were supplemented
with 10% FBS (Invitrogen). All cells were cultivated
in the presence of 100 U/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml
streptomycin.Cells were transfected with the episomal
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Cells were seeded in 6-well plates (2x105 cells/
well) and cultured in the presence or absence of 100
ng/ml DOX. For flow cytometry, cells were trypsinized
after 72 hours for GFP/RFP analysis, washed and
resuspended in PBS. For detection of GFP expression
10,000 cells per sample were analyzed with a C6 Flow
1409

Oncotarget 2013; 4: 1399-1415

Cytometer Instrument (BD Accuri). For DNA content
analysis (1x105) SW480 cells were seeded per 6-well and
transfected with 50nM of miR-34a or control oligo. After
24 hours cells were treated with DOX (final concentration
100 ng/ml [Sigma]) or water and incubated for another 48
hours until harvesting. Floating cells and trypsinized cells
were collected by centrifugation at 1200 rpm (600 g) for 5
minutes, fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol and stored over
night on ice. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS), 0.5 ml FACS solution (PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 60
mg/ml propidium iodide (PI) and 0.5 mg/ml RNase) was
added per sample and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. DNA
content was determined analyzing 10,000 cells per sample
using a C6 device (Accuri, Erembodegem, Belgium) and
three independent samples per treatment.

Mix (Applied Biosystems). A list of qPCR-primers used
for this study is provided in Supplemental Table 4.

Soft agar colony formation assay for anchorageindependent growth
The bottom of a 12-well was coated with 700 µl base
agar containing 0.8% low melt agarose (Lonza) which was
then covered with 700 µl 0.4% agarose containing 2,000
SW480 cells, either transfected with miR-34a or control
oligo 24 hours before, and incubated for 24 hours at 37°C
and 5% CO2. 24 hours later, 250 µl medium supplemented
with 10% FBS was added supplemented with either
doxycycline (final concentration 100 ng/ml [Sigma]; stock
solution 100 μg/ml in water) or vehicle (water). Cells were
incubated for 14 days changing the media every 3 days.
For determination of colony numbers cells were stained
with 500 µl of 0.005% crystal violet per well for 2 hours
and de-stained in PBS over night at 4°C. Pictures were
taken using an EOS 400D camera (Canon) and colonies
were counted using image J software (NIH).

Cloning of the c-Kit 3’-UTR
The 3’-UTR of c-Kit mRNA containing putative
miR-34a binding sites was PCR-amplified from oligo-dTprimed cDNA from human diploid fibroblast cells with
the Verso cDNA kit (Thermo Scientific). The 3’-UTR
was cloned into pGL3-control-MCS [90] and verified by
sequencing. Mutagenesis of seed sequences was done with
the QuickChange Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) according
to manufacturer’s instructions. Oligonucleotides used for
cloning and mutagenesis are provided in Supplemental
Table 3.

Real-time impedance measurement
A real-time cell analyzer (RTCA) (xCelligence
RTCA SP; Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Penzberg,
Germany) was used to assess cellular impedance
according to manufacturer’s instructions. 5000 cells were
seeded into each well of an E-plate 16. The seeded cells
were allowed to equilibrate for at least 30 minutes in the
tissue culture incubator, then transfected or treated with
doxycycline respectively before electrode resistance/
impedance was recorded every 60 minutes. After 24 hours
5-FU was administered. The measurement was done
every 60 minutes for 48 hours. The electrical impedance
is represented as a dimension/unit-less parameter termed
cell-index, which represents the relative change in
electrical impedance that occurs in the presence and
absence of cells in the wells. This change is calculated
based on the following formula: CI = (Zi −Z0)/15, where
Zi determines the impedance at an individual experimental
time point and Z0 is the impedance measured at the
beginning of the experiment. The impedance is measured
at three different frequencies (10, 25 or 50 kHz) (ref:
Roche Diagnostics GmbH. Introduction of the RTCA DP
Instrument. RTCA DP Instrument Operator‘s Manual, A.
Acea Biosciences, Inc.; 2008.).

Dual Luciferase Reporter Assays
SW480 cells were seeded in 12-well format at
1x104 cells/well, and transfected after 48 hours with 100
ng of the indicated firefly luciferase reporter plasmid, 20
ng of Renilla reporter plasmid for normalization and 25
nM of miR-34a/b/c pre-miRNA (Ambion, PM11030) or
a negative control oligonucleotide (Ambion, neg. control
#1). Luciferase assays were carried out after 48 hours with
the Dual Luciferase Reporter assay system (Promega)
according to manufacturer’s instructions. Fluorescence
intensities were measured with a luminometer (Berthold)
in 96-well format and analyzed with the Simplicity
software package (DLR).

Quantitative Real-Time PCR
Total RNA was prepared with the High Pure
RNA Isolation Kit (Roche) according to manufacturer´s
instructions. cDNA was generated from 1 µg of total RNA
per sample using anchored oligo-dT primers (Verso Kit,
Thermo Fischer). All results were normalized to β-actin.
Per time point/condition three independent experiments
were conducted. RT-qPCR was performed using the
LightCycler (Roche) and the Fast SYBR Green Master

oligo [100 nM each] and treated with SCF [10 ng/ml] or
vehicle. After 24 hours cells were seeded into Boyden
chambers (Corning) either coated (invasion) or uncoated
(migration) with Matrigel (BD Bioscience) at a dilution
of 3.3 ng/ml in medium without serum. Medium was
supplemented with SCF for stimulated cases. Cells
were allowed to migrate for 48 hours, then non-motile
cells at the top of the filter were removed and the cells
in the bottom chamber were fixed with methanol and
stained with DAPI. Per membrane, the cell number was
determined in five fields by fluorescence microscopy.

Sphere formation assay
For induction of sphere formation adherent DLD-1
cells were trypsinized and 1 x 105 cells were seeded into
a six-well coated with attachment preventing PolyHEMA
(Sigma) using 5 ml sphere-medium consisting of
DMEM-F12 + GlutaMAX-I (Invitrogen) supplemented
with B27 supplement (1:50; Invitrogen), EGF (20 ng/
ml; R&D Systems), BSA (0.4 %, Sigma) and insulin
(4 µg/ml; Invitrogen). [75]. Immediately after seeding
the cells were transfected with either a control oligo or
miR-34a [200 nM] and treated with either water or SCF
[10ng/ml]. Resulting spheres were trypsinized again and
quantified as well as employed for a second generation.
For quantification 1 x 104 cells/well were seeded in
sphere-medium containing 1 % methyl cellulose (Sigma)
into PolyHEMA coated 96-well plates (at least six wells
per unicate). The number of colonies larger than 50 µm in
diameter was determined after seven days. Representative
pictures were taken using an EOS 400D camera (Canon)
at 40 fold magnification.
