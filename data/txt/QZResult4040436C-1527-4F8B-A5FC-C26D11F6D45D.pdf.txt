Abstract
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a leading cause of death worldwide.
Targeted monotherapies produce high regression rates, albeit for limited patient
subgroups, who inevitably succumb. We present a novel strategy for identifying
customized combinations of triplets of targeted agents, utilizing a simplified
interventional mapping system (SIMS) that merges knowledge about existent drugs
and their impact on the hallmarks of cancer. Based on interrogation of matched lung
tumor and normal tissue using targeted genomic sequencing, copy number variation,
transcriptomics, and miRNA expression, the activation status of 24 interventional
nodes was elucidated. An algorithm was developed to create a scoring system that
enables ranking of the activated interventional nodes for each patient. Based on the
trends of co-activation at interventional points, combinations of drug triplets were
defined in order to overcome resistance. This methodology will inform a prospective
trial to be conducted by the WIN consortium, aiming to significantly impact survival
in metastatic NSCLC and other malignancies.

INTRODUCTION

monotherapies apply to only small subsets of oncogenedriven patients, and virtually all develop resistance and
succumb to their disease [5]. Relapse occurs mostly as a
consequence of the Darwinian selection of tumour clones
harboring genomic variants that lead to the activation
of additional signaling pathways and, hence, resistance.
This is perhaps not unexpected, as tumors often exhibit
a large variety of molecular abnormalities [6, 7], even at
diagnosis. Heterogeneity across tumor clones is amplified
in metastases, and in response to therapeutic pressure.
Combination of cytotoxic therapies have been
demonstrated to be effective where single agents provide
only moderate benefits, as illustrated in Hodgkin’s
lymphoma. Whether this paradigm applies to targeted
therapy remains unclear for most diseases. However,
recently, combinations targeting the same pathway (e.g.
trametanib (MEK) inhibitor together with dabrafenib
(BRAF inhibitor) in BRAF-mutant melanoma [8] or
resistance pathways (combining PIK3CA and MEK
inhibitors) [9] showed efficacy, either preclinically and/

Lung cancer is one of the most prevalent and deadly
malignancies, contributing a staggering 1.6 million cases
diagnosed per year and about 21% of cancer deaths to the
global cancer burden [1, 2]. The majority of individuals
with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) present at the
metastatic stage, and most patients with localized disease
will relapse. The standard of care in advanced diseasemainly cytotoxic chemotherapy and targeted agents for
selected subsets, has had modest impact on mortality, with
dismal one- and five-year survival rates of around 15%
and 4%, respectively, for patients with metastatic disease
[1, 2]. For patients who have failed first-line therapy, the
median survival is only about seven months.
Targeted therapies implemented in standard care are
directed at the activated products of mutated epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) [3] or ALK translocation
[4], and have shown high response rates, and improved
progression-free survival (PFS). However, these

benefit and increasing survival, we intend to explore the
efficacy of triple regimen therapy, following the historical
success in diseases such as acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome. The major challenges for this effort are
delineating the scientific rationale for matching agents
with patients’ tumors, while being cognizant of potential
toxicity for multi-drug regimens.
The nosologic segmentation of NSCLC based
mainly on genomics heralded a new era, enabling
successful development of targeted monotherapy for
selected molecular subsets [3, 4, 10, 11]. The recent report
of the Cancer Genome ATLAS Research Network shows
that 62% of lung adenocarcinomas harbored activating
mutations in known driver oncogenes; cancer-associated
mutations in KRAS (32%), EGFR (11%) and BRAF (7%),
were common [12]. Despite this progress, many patients
still have no identified druggable genomic alterations and,
as previously mentioned, most of those who do rapidly
relapse. Strategies to delineate rational combinations
of targeted therapy, using multi-platform, advanced
omics technologies that move beyond genomics alone in
NSCLC are lacking. Using novel tools and paradigms,
the complexity of molecular aberrations in cancer may
be better understood in terms of critical convergence
pathways. In the present report, we propose a pragmatic
approach using a simplified interventional points matching
system (SIMS) that will produce customized triple therapy
regimens for individual patients based on the most
common abnormalities found in a genomic/transcriptomic
analysis of matched tumor and normal biopsies from 121
patients with lung cancer.

framework for precision combinational cancer medicine
(Figure 1).
First, we reduced the enormous complexity of
biological pathways and signaling cross talk by devising
a simplified map that concentrates only on the genes
that are most indicative of drug/target status. We defined
“intervention points,” which consist of drug targets or
groups of targets, as well as genes upstream of the targets,
that together reflect a specific biological activity that is
actionable through therapeutic interventions. For example,
pan-HER therapies define the HER group of receptors and
their ligands as a single intervention point (Figure 1A).
The second part of the work proposed a simplified
approach for prioritizing intervention points for a specific
patient. The basic premise behind the proposed score
is that when the genes associated with an intervention
point are more “disturbed” as compared to their status
in normal cells (in terms of sequence and/or expression
level), the more likely it is that this intervention point will
be crucial to the tumor. From this it follows that the more
disturbed the genes of an intervention point, the higher
the probability that therapeutics targeted at that point will
impact the viability of tumor cells, and hence benefit the
patient.
In the present work, we first developed a family of
simple scores that combine somatic mutations found in
the intervention point genes with copy number variations
(CNVs) and expression changes in protein-coding
transcripts and in miRNAs. The rank normalization (in
our example, using deciles) is used to make the scores of
different intervention points comparable. We evaluated
these scores in silico on our 121 patient NSCLC dataset.
Finally, a method is needed for integrating the
scores and choosing combinations that are likely to benefit
the patients. Here we used an algorithmic approach.
We described the status of 24 intervention points in a
panel of 121 patients with lung cancer as an example.
From this foundation, we applied a knowledge-driven
strategy to look for three-drug combinations that might
complementarily or synergistically benefit the patient. We
identified those pathways that co-occur frequently in the
patients and are mechanistically independent. To further
improve the efficacy of the proposed combinations,
we propose to add immunomodulating therapies (i.e.
anti-PD1L or anti-CTLA4) to the triplet regimens, with
the additional aim of reducing the chance of drug/drug
interactions and side effects (from combining, for instance,
three tyrosine kinase inhibitors), while maintaining/
enhancing predicted efficacy.

RESULTS
Overview of the Simplified Interventional Points
Matching System (SIMS) strategy
Our objective was to establish a realistic framework
that would allow useful drug combinations to be identified
in a personalized way (i.e. matching the combination to the
patient based on the tumor characteristics). This strategy
involved three steps: (i) find interventional points/ nodes/
markers for common classes of drugs. (We delineated 24
markers covering 183 genes (Table 1 and Supplemental
Tables 1-7); (ii) find a score that summarizes the behavior
of these markers in a given patient. The score should be
proportional to the probability that the cognate drug(s)
would produce salutary effects; and (iii) delineate a set
number of triple drug combinations that could be tested
clinically, and that would maximize the number of patients
whose activated interventional nodes would be impacted.
Based on these assumptions, we proposed the

normal counterpart, and this activation can be efficiently blocked by a panHer inhibitor, such as a fatinib; B: Scoring the status of specific

in Supplemental Table 5. While somatic mutations
automatically generated a score of 10, only a subset of
tumors carried activating mutations. Most of the scores
were obtained based on gene expression and penalized by
miRNA expression. miRNA induced a significant penalty
of scores for mTor, AKT, PTEN, RAS, ERK , PI3K and
surprisingly PDL1, whereas impact on other interventional
points was not significant. In this data set, CNV also had a
non -significant impact on the score.
Assuming that preferred combinations will include
two targeted therapies and an immunomodulator to
attenuate risk of toxicity, we investigated the frequency
of activation of PDL1 and CTLA4 (Table 2). PDL1 is

activated in 63 (out of 121 patients), CTLA4 is activated
in 58 (out of 121 patients) and PDL1 and CTLA4 are coactivated in 36 patients out of 121. In total 87 patients (out
of 121) (71%) have one of two immune-related targets
activated (PDL1 or CTLA4), whereas 36 patients (of 121)
do not have activation of immune targets.

Interventional node activation/co-activation
In the next step, we made the selection of all
activated interventional points. Scores 8, 9 and 10 were
designated high activation, whereas scores 6 and 7 were
designated medium activation. Scores <6 were designated

Figure 2: A: Flowchart of the scoring system: The principles of the score are the followings: A Score is designed to correlate
with the likelihood that an interventional node is abnormally active in the tumor. It ranges from 1 to 10. The score combines
evidence from 3 data sources: mutations, meanfold change in gene over expression (mRNA and miRNA) in the tumor versus normal and
copy number variation. Different data sources will trigger different weights in the score: i) activating mutations (e.g. KRAS in the RAS
path) have decisive weight. The maximal score of 10 is given to every node with an activating mutation; ii) in the absence of a mutation,
the score is based on weighted sum of the mRNA meanfold changes corrected by an adjustment based on miRNAs and to a lesser extent
on CNV abnormalities. B: Principle of the calibrator: In Y: Fold change (Fc) of differential gene expression between tumor (T) and normal
(N) in each patient. In X: number of patients (No): for each graph, the order of patients is different. This series serves as a calibrator for
calculation of deciles. For every new measurement in each patient, the meanfold change for mRNA is plotted against the calibrator curve,
and the deciles partition of the curve enables assignment of a score from 1 to 10. The score obtained based on the mRNA is corrected by
miRNA, and is considered in the absence of mutations.

as non-activated interventional points. This threshold was
determined based on the distribution of values for each
interventional point in the data set of 121 patients. Figure
2B shows this distribution for three nodes; however all the
other points had a similar trajectory.
Supplemental Tables 6 and 7 show trends of coactivations of the 24 interventional points, and provide
new insights into the biology of NSCLC, demonstrating
the complexity of co-activation of interventional

therapeutic choices. Overall, the most commonly activated

cancer histological types.
Combinations for patients with EGFR mutations
or ALK rearrangements were less common because
only a small proportion of our NSCLC displayed such
aberrations.
Of interest, all the most commonly aberrantly
activated interventional nodes can be targeted by drugs
currently available in clinical trials or approved (as
described in Table 1).

Selection of triplet combinations
Focusing on the PDL1-activated group of patients,
we determined the most frequent possible combinations.
The six triplets that encompassed the greatest proportion
of patients (>15% NSCLC) are described in Table 3. 	
The most frequent combinations that include PDL1
are activation of RAS/RAF, mTOR/PI3K and PDL1 (28%
of all NSCLC) (Table 3). The other combinations are
presented in the Discussion and as shown in Supplemental
Tables 5 and 6, these combinations are overlapping in
different patients, meaning that a given patient could
potentially benefit from two or even more combinations.
Overall, the six most frequent combinations that include
PDL1 cover 63 out of 121 NSCLC patients, with no

We describe here a novel, simplified intervention
mapping system (SIMS) method to efficiently identify
the key activated pathways in a given cancer. The aim
is to provide treatment guidance in the clinic in the form
of a combination of three agents directed against the
three intervention points most critical to the individual
neoplasm.
In NSCLC, as well as in many cancer types,

in segmentation of nosological classifications, based
previously on the organ of origin and histology, into a
variety of molecular subtypes, often characterized by
one specific driver molecular genetic alteration [3-14].
These driver alterations have successfully guided the
development of novel targeted therapies for subsets of
patients with NSCLC and EGFR mutations, as well as
ALK or ROS translocations, and now a variety of other
small subsets (BRAF mutations, HER2 mutations, etc).
However, this strategy has several limitations: (i) only
a portion of tumors have an identified driver mutation,
and many of these simple models may have been already
described [15, 20]; (ii) there is no recognized strategy
to efficiently pinpoint unrecognized drivers within the
complex and multiple genomic alterations observed in
most tumors; (iii) targeted treatments are not uniformly
efficient even in these selected subgroups; (iv) the majority
of tumors are actually driven by multiple aberrant genes
[18, 19, 20], making the monotherapy paradigm unsuitable
for most metastatic cancers; and (v) resistance uniformly
emerges in a Darwinian manner in patients treated with a
single targeted therapy.
The work presented here proposes a novel strategy
to overcome these major limitations for the development
of targeted therapies in patients with cancer. Using
a dataset of 121 patients with NSCLC patients, and
combining mutation information, CNV, and miRNA
and mRNA expression in matched tumor and normal
tissues, 24 intervention points potentially actionable
by currently available targeted agents were identified,
and allocated a score for each individual patient. We
identified specific interventional points/nodes for drugs
based on the pathways upregulated in each patient’s
cancer. This approach for prioritizing intervention points
for a patient is simple. The basic premise is that, when
the genes associated with an intervention point are more
disturbed (in terms of sequence and/or expression level),
the intervention point is more likely to be crucial to the
tumor. From this, it follows that the more disturbed the
genes of an intervention point are, the more likely it is that
therapeutics targeting that point will benefit the patient.
Accordingly, we have developed a family of simple scores
that combine the level of gene expression in the tumor
(relative to matched normal control), the mutations found
in the intervention points’ genes, CNVs and miRNAs
expression levels. Intervention points with high scores
varied across patients, but groups of tumors with similar
combinations of high scores of activation points were
identified, leading to a new dimensional classification of
these tumors with potential predictive value for treatment
efficacy. The technology described to delineate this score
requires samples of tumor tissue and corresponding normal
tissue, and molecular characterization tools that are readily
available in many modern translational research facilities
dedicated to cancer research. Its implementation in the
clinical realm, integrating as well the rapid continuous
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

improvements in technology, should therefore be readily
feasible for the clinical trial setting.
The aim of this tool is to guide treatment decisions.
We propose a new therapeutic approach of triple regimen
therapies aimed at simultaneously blocking different
biologic pathways and reducing the chance of developing
secondary resistance. This simplified interventional
mapping system (SIMS) identifies within the hallmarks
of cancer [20] only signaling and regulatory pathways
that can be targeted with available therapeutic agents. The
principle of simplification is based on the activating signal
that can be blocked by a class of drugs.
We therefore propose that combinations of three
different classes of targeted agents acting on three
independent intervention nodes will be necessary to
derive a significant survival advantage for a given patient.
One of these agents should ideally target the immune
checkpoints, such as PDL1/PD1, or CTLA-4. The
selection of a combination of three drugs derives from
several considerations: (i) combinations of two drugs
have shown modest improvements in survival compared
to monotherapy; (ii) combinations of four or more agents
will likely be excessively toxic [21]; and (iii) large enough
subgroups of patients with the same three intervention
points with high scores were identified in this work.
Focusing on the PDL1-activated group of patients,
we determined the most frequent possible combinations
(Table 5). Interest in PDL1-targeting agents is due to
toxicity that differs from that of targeted agents, with
less chance of overlap and hence amplified side effects
when given together with two targeted agents such as
tyrosine kinase inhibitors [21]. By far the most frequent
combination involves activation of Ras/Raf, mTor/PI3K
and PD1L, accounting for 28% of all NSCLCs. This major
finding is consistent with the ATLAS report [12]: showing
that recurrent aberrations in multiple key pathways and
processes characterize lung adenocarcinoma. Among
these were RTK/RAS/ RAF pathway activation (76%
of cases), PI(3)K-mTOR pathway activation (25%), p53
pathway alteration (63%), and alteration of cell cycle
regulators (64%). Our data, obtained in an independent
cohort, (representative for all NSCLC and not only
adenocarcinoma), shows very similar results : Ras/Raf
activated in 73% and CDK4,6 activated in 51% [Table
3]. However, while previous reports affirm molecular
segmentation of lung cancers, our data presents, for
the first time, trends of coactivations in each individual
patient, enabling definition and selection of combinations
of therapies.
In addition to RAS/RAF, mTOR/PI3K and PDL1,
other frequently co-activated pathways involving PDL1
are as follows [Supplemental Table 8]: (i) angiogenesis,
RAS/RAF and PDL1 (20% NSCLC); (ii) PDL1, mTOR/
PI3K and DNA Repair (19%); (iii) Ras/Raf, Met and
PDL1 (18%); (iv) PDL1, mTor/PI3K and CDK4,6 (17%)
and (v) PDL1, mTOR/PI3K, angiogenesis (17%). Overall,

counterpart, combined with a comprehensive systems
biology investigation and innovative bioinformatics and
scoring systems, may enable matching each individual
patient with the most appropriate combination. Moreover,
each patient will potentially benefit from different
combinations, conferring a high chance of impacting
survival of metastatic NSCLC.
One of the cornerstones of this new methodology is
use of dual matched tumor and normal biopsies from the
same patient, enabling the subtraction of transcriptomic
background noise in each patient [13, 23]. Dual matched
biopsies were implemented, for the first time in a clinical
setting, in the WINTHER trial (http://clinicaltrials.gov/
show/NCT01856296) of the Worldwide Innovative
Networking (WIN) consortium (www.winconsortium.org)
for personalized cancer therapy, and have proved feasible.
Nevertheless, this work does have several
limitations. The number of patients with NSCLC was
relatively small, and the data was collected retrospectively.
Some important targets, such as EGFR and ALK, were
not highlighted in the current results, mainly because
they affected small numbers of our patients, and the
effort here was to impact larger subgroups of individuals
with NSCLC who may not benefit from EGFR and ALK
inhibitors. It is probable that other populations, such as
Asians, might have distinct patterns of aberrations, e.g.,
higher proportions with EGFR mutations. Fortunately,
the algorithm permits adaptations to various populations
and even to individuals. Many of the patients in our
dataset had early-stage disease raising the question of
extrapolation of the observations to late-stage patients.
However, interestingly, our patients’ tumors still expressed
multiple perturbed interventional nodes, consistent with
the concept that, by the time lung cancer is diagnosed,
it already exhibits significant molecular heterogeneity.
Additionally, we know of no other database of lung tumor
and matched normal tissue from the same patient being
comprehensively evaluated for mutations, gene expression,
miRNA expression and CNV, enabling a comparison with
the CHEMORES unique retrospective collection [13, 14].
In comparison, when analysing ATLAS sources [12], while
the collection of 236 adenocarcinomas included matched
tumor and normal tissues, only sequencing was performed
on tumor and normal DNA; gene expression was done in
a classic fashion, with microarrays investigating only the
tumor RNA. However the frequencies of occurrence of
major interventional points such as Ras/Raf, mTor/PI3K,
and cell cycle regulators appear to be similar to that in our
study.
Another limitation of our work is the challenge
it presents for pre-clinical validation. Validation of the
SIMS tool requires matched tumor and normal tissues
from the same individual. Current preclinical models
(cell lines in two or three dimensional culture, and
xenografts in nude mice) cannot address this concept.
Moreover, it is increasingly unclear as to the extent that

these six combinations cover 63 out of 121 patients with
NSCLC regardless of histology. These combinations
are overlapping in many patients, implying that each
individual patient could potentially benefit from two
or more combinations. Nevertheless, when taking into
account all the possible combinations described in Table
3, it is worthwhile to mention that each patient may benefit
from a therapeutic solution based on targeted agents
available today. The finding is related to the new way of
defining activated interventional nodes.
Integration of a variety omic datasets is advocated
by many recently published opinions [13, 22, 23].
Consistent with the necessity of an integrative view, we
used the power of multiple omic investigations in a novel
way, defining a methodology and tools of integration
focused on selection of combined therapies, which meets
an urgent clinical need. This method aims to advance
the paradigm of investigating individualized therapeutic
options, in order to improve clinical outcome of patients
with metastatic NSCLC.
Our system suggests that the combinations of
three targeted treatments aimed at three intervention
points with high scores enables selection of subgroups
of patients of sufficient size so that clinical trials may be
practically feasible. Although the analogy remains limited,
it is noteworthy that tri-therapies with different modes of
actions have previously been demonstrated to efficiently
provide long-term control and/or cure for viral (HIV)
and bacterial (TB) infections, Childhood leukemias also
required combination therapy for long-term remission and
cure. None of these ailments were cured with single agent
treatment.
It should also be noted that our method for selecting
triple-agent customized therapy for a patient assumes that
impacting the three most “disturbed “ intervention points
in a tumor would induce the best response. However, the
SIMS framework can be used to test alternative hypotheses
as well. For instance, one such alternative hypothesis is
that simultaneous vertical targeting of a critical pathway
by distinct types of drugs (such as antibodies and small
molecule kinase inhibitors etc.) would more effectively
extinguish the pathway.
One of the key forthcoming steps will be the
implementation of clinical trials with innovative phase I/
II telescoped designs in order to validate this strategy, and
the delineation of the recommended doses of the combined
targeted treatments. It will be particularly important
to establish whether the treatments should be given
simultaneously or sequentially, in order to both maximize
antitumor effect and optimize tolerance.
Our work suggests a feasible prospective clinical
trial that would benefit from several major assets. First,
we identified at least six possible combinations of two
targeted therapies together with an immune-modulator,

these cell line or animal models can predict behavior in
vivo, especially with immunomodulators that require
an intact immune system, perhaps partially explaining
the high attrition rate of drugs in development. Another
limitation of the study relates to the targeted genomic
sequencing that was performed. With the rapid evolution
in technologies, more complete genomic sequencing
should be applied to the next version of this analysis.
Furthermore, next generations of the algorithm may
also recognize distinctions between anomalies even
within the same gene. For instance, not all p53 mutations
behave as loss of function. Further, our understanding
of the clinically relevant cut offs for expression of gene
products such as PDL1 is still evolving, and correlating
transcript expression to protein levels is in a nascent
phase. Importantly, therefore, prospective validation of the
algorithm and patterns of pathway abnormalities will be
crucial. Furthermore, with the startling pace of advances
in molecular methodological capabilities, algorithmical
approaches to molecular complexity may need to be
viewed as an iterative process, with prototypes being
built and tested, and learning through the life cycle of the
validation procedures.
In conclusion, this simplified intervention mapping
system potentially reduces the enormous complexity of
biological signals and pathway cross talk by devising
a streamlined map that focuses only on the genes that
are most indicative of drug target status, defined as
“intervention points”. These intervention points consist
of drug targets or groups of drug targets and some genes
upstream of the drug targets that together reflect a specific
biological activity that is actionable through currently
available therapeutic interventions. This simplified
mapping and scoring tool provides a new way of
integrating genomic data, not previously described, even
in state-of-the art reports [22] SIMS converts thousands
of genomic measurements into a simple format, that can
potentially be exploited by clinicians, and may facilitate
rationally based selection of targeted agents for the
treatment of individual patients and, most importantly,
selection of triple therapy combinations.
To summarize, targeted monotherapies lead
systematically to resistance. To overcome resistance,
we present a novel therapeutic interventional mapping
system and algorithm, based on integration of genomic
and transcriptomic data that may allow deployment
of customized combinations of therapy. Therefore,
the integrative omic approach together with the SIMS
algorithmic strategy and tools presented herein can be
realistically exploited to inform the development of
next generation clinical trials addressing personalized
combinations of targeted cancer treatments, a strategy with
the objective of impacting survival and of progress towards
a curative approach for patients with metastatic NSCLC.
To this aim, the WIN Consortium has aligned numerous
stakeholders including academia, the pharmaceutical
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

industry, biotechnology, and health payors in order to
prepare and launch the SPRING (Survival Prolongation
by Rationale Innovative Genomics) lung cancer clinical
trial, whose objective will be to prospectively validate the
SIMS concept. Importantly, the same strategy may also be
applicable to other deadly malignancies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and tissue samples
The present study used in silico data generated
and published by the CHEMORES initiative (www.
chemores.org), which is an EU funded (FP6) Integrated
Project. Tissue samples from a cohort of 121 patients
who underwent complete surgical resection at the Institut
Mutualiste Montsouris (Paris, France) between 30 January
2002 and 26 June 2006 were analyzed.

Characteristics of NSCLC cohort
The median age of patients was 63 years (range,
41-85 years); 89 patients (73%) were men (Supplemental
Table 1). The histopathology of all tumors was reviewed
by the same pathologist. The most common subtypes of
tumor were adenocarcinoma and squamous cell cancer.
Using the new 7th edition TNM staging, 56 were stage
I, 24 stage II, 27 stage III and 4 stage IV. Adjuvant
platinum based chemotherapy was administered to 61
patients. Fifty-nine patients experienced a relapse. Twoyear relapse-free survival was 64%, and the median time
to recurrence for the cohort was 5.2 years. After a median
follow up of 40 months (range, 0-92 years) 36 patients had
died and 23 patients were alive with recurrence.
This study was performed using snap-frozen tumor
and matched normal lung tissue, from the same patients,
after curative surgery. Samples were handled according
to the Tumor Analysis Best Practices Working Group
[14]. Haematoxylin and eosin stained frozen sections,
taken before and after the cutting of slides for molecular
analysis, revealed a median cell content of 85% (an interquartile range of 65% to 95%). All tissues were banked
after written informed patient consent, and the study was
approved by the Ethics Committee of Gustave Roussy
(GR). A full description of the genomic investigation
is available at Lazar et al. [13], and in Supplemental
Methods [15-17] and data. [Supplemental Tables 2,
3, and 4 describe the genes, mutations, and miRNAs
analyzed]. The microarray data related to this study have
been submitted to the Array Express data repository
at the European Bioinformatics Institute (http://www.
ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/) under the accession numbers
E-MTAB-1132 (GE), E-MTAB-1133 (CGH) and
E-MTAB-1134 (MIR).

Scoring/ranking of activated interventional points

Gene expression

(Figure 2). A score of 1 to 10 is assigned. If a
mutation is present, a score of 10 is given and the
transcriptomic information is not used. If there is no
mutation, the CNV and transcriptomic information
(mRNA adjusted by miRNA) are scored.

For each interventional node, mRNA steady state
level in tumor vs. normal is used to calculate a mean
fold change of the pathway from the values of individual
fold change (Fc) of tumor vs normal for each gene of the
interventional nodes. For calculating the mean/average
fold change of intervention point k, denoted as Ek, the
fold changes of differentially expressed genes with a
fold change of at least 1.3 are used. Based on Agilent
microarrays specifications, the threshold of 1.3 was
considered as the lowest conferring accurate detection,
since all Fc values were obtained by combining two dyes
swap microarray experiments. In other words, for each
intervention point, an average fold-change of the genes i
of the intervention point k is calculated, trimming values
with a threshold of <1.3. Formally, we calculate Ek as the
following: let Mk denote the set of genes that belong to
intervention point k, and mk denote the subset of Mk that
includes only differential expressed genes with an absolute
fold change >1.3. Ek is the average of the fold change of
the genes mk.
. We
then calculate the mean expression level for all the genes

The algorithm
The mathematical modelling and scoring system
aims to give a score (1 to 10) based on integration of
omics data, sequencing, gene expression, miRNA and
copy number variations determined as differences between
tumor and normal tissues, individually for each patient.
Scoring enables identification and ranking of activated
pathways, and the overall concept is that such activated
pathways should be blocked with combined targeted
therapies.

The mathematical model
The initial model was established on the basis of
a retrospective dataset from 121 patients with NSCLC
for whom sequencing, CNVs, and tumor vs. normal
gene expression were available. Using these data, an
algorithm that provides a score of activation for each of
the simplified pathways for the patient and factors in all
of the above-mentioned structural and functional results
has been established. The principle of the algorithm is
described below:

in mk:
wherein
. In other words, the fold
change for a particular intervention point is the average or
arithmetic mean of the fold changes of genes belonging to
the intervention point as defined in Table 1 and having a
fold change T vs N of 1.3 or more. In particular, in order to
compare the fold changes of different intervention points,
a relative scoring, e.g., from 1 to 10, is generated based on
the decile calculation using as calibrator the data obtained
from all 121 NSCLC patients. Values of individual mean
fold changes for each simplified pathway are ranked in
the retrospective set of data of 121 patients with NSCLC,
used as a calibrator. As shown in Figure 2B the range of
changes is different from one pathway to another. In order
to compare them, we generated a relative scoring from 1
to 10 based on the decile calculation.

Scoring
Scoring is performed by using an intuitive algorithm
that integrates four types of molecular investigations of
tumor and normal tissues (genomics, mRNA expression,
miRNA and copy number variations).

Combining mRNA and miRNA measurements

Mutations
To adjust for possible miRNA intervention in
translation, we penalized discordance between miRNA
and its target mRNA. For each of the genes of Table 1
(and Supplemental Table 2) that belong to the intervention
points or a set thereof, we determined the miRNAs most
likely to be involved in their regulation using Target scan
{http://www.targetscan.org/}, selecting the top 5 miRNAs
for each gene. Supplementary Table 4 provides a list of
the top 5 miRNAs for the genes of Table 1. For each gene
i, a mean miRNA fold-change can be calculated, which is
denoted Ai, by averaging the fold changes of the 5 miRNAs
(or less if less than 5 miRNAs are identified) that are most
likely to target gene i. Then, for each gene, a mean miRNA

In version 1, we used a very limited set of
sequencing data, including only the genes/mutations used
currently in clinical care of NSCLC: EGFR, KRAS, BRAF,
PI3KCA, and HER2. Additionally we sequenced p53, the
most frequently mutated gene in lung (and most other
solid) tumors. When a mutation is detected, the algorithm
assigns the maximal score 10 in the corresponding
simplified pathway.

TvN fold change is determined. Then, a corrected fold
change of a gene of an intervention point is calculated by
dividing the mRNA fold change of tumor versus normal
of the gene (mRNA TvN fold change) by the mean fold
change for the miRNAs of the gene (mean miRNA TvN
fold change). The corrected fold change of a gene is then
used to calculate the fold change for a particular pathway
by using it in the calculation of the average fold changes
of the genes belonging to the pathway as defined in Table
1 and having a fold change T vs N of 1.3 or more. Based
on the corrected fold change of pathways, a corrected
score, e.g., a score 1 to 10 is generated based on deciles.

When amplification is detected, we multiply the
value of the mRNA expression fold change for each gene
by the value of the fold change in copy number. Then we
generate the corrected mean fold change of pathways and
the deciles score. However CNV had little impact in our
analysis of the 183 genes in 121 patients.
