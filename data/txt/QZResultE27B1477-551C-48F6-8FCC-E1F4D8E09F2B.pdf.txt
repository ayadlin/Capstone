ABSTRACT
The CDK inhibitor SNS-032 had previously exerted promising anti-neuroblastoma
activity via CDK7 and 9 inhibition. ABCB1 expression was identified as major
determinant of SNS-032 resistance. Here, we investigated the role of ABCB1 in
acquired SNS-032 resistance. In contrast to ABCB1-expressing UKF-NB-3 sublines resistant to other ABCB1 substrates, SNS-032-adapted UKF-NB-3 (UKF-NB3rSNS- 032300nM) cells remained sensitive to the non-ABCB1 substrate cisplatin and
were completely re-sensitized to cytotoxic ABCB1 substrates by ABCB1 inhibition.
Moreover, UKF-NB-3rSNS-032300nM cells remained similarly sensitive to CDK7 and 9
inhibition as UKF-NB-3 cells. In contrast, SHEPrSNS-0322000nM, the SNS-032-resistant
sub-line of the neuroblastoma cell line SHEP, displayed low level SNS-032 resistance
also when ABCB1 was inhibited. This discrepancy may be explained by the higher
SNS-032 concentrations that were used to establish SHEPrSNS-0322000nM cells,
since SHEP cells intrinsically express ABCB1 and are less sensitive to SNS-032 (IC50
912 nM) than UKF-NB-3 cells (IC50 153 nM). In conclusion, we show that ABCB1
expression represents the primary (sometimes exclusive) resistance mechanism in
neuroblastoma cells with acquired resistance to SNS-032. Thus, ABCB1 inhibitors
may increase the SNS-032 efficacy in ABCB1-expressing cells and prolong or avoid
resistance formation.

INTRODUCTION

crucial SNS-032 drug targets differs between different
cancer cell types [4, 7–9, 12, 19]. We recently showed
that therapeutic SNS-032 concentrations exerted antineuroblastoma effects in a panel of 109 neuroblastoma
cell lines (19 parental neuroblastoma cell lines, 90 sublines with acquired resistance to 14 different anti-cancer
drugs) and in primary neuroblastoma cells [19]. SNS032 further inhibited tumor growth in a chemoresistant
neuroblastoma xenograft model [19]. Interference with
CDK7 and CDK9 appeared to be critical for the antineuroblastoma effects of SNS-032 [19].
SNS-032 had further been speculated to interfere
with ABCB1 (also known as P-glycoprotein or MDR1)
[20]. Our report (published on the 1st December 2013)

Neuroblastoma is the most frequent solid
extracranial pediatric cancer. About half of the patients are
diagnosed with high-risk disease associated with overall
survival rates below 50% despite myeloablative therapy
and differentiation therapy using retinoids [1, 2].
SNS-032 (BMS-387032) is a cyclin-dependent
kinase 2 (CDK2), 7, and 9 inhibitor under pre-clinical
and clinical investigation for a wide range of solid
and hematologic malignancies [3–16] including
neuroblastoma [17–19]. The compound was initially
introduced as N-acyl-2-aminothiazole inhibitor of CDK2
[3]. The relevance of CDK2, CDK7, and/ or CDK9 as

[19] and another report (published on 23rd December
2013) [21] confirmed this assumption. ABCB1 expression
was the dominant SNS-032-resistance mechanism in
neuroblastoma cells from a panel of 109 neuroblastoma
cell lines [19]. Only ABCB1-expressing neuroblastoma
cell lines were insensitive to therapeutically achievable
SNS-032 concentrations. In the presence of ABCB1
inhibitors, all 30 ABCB1-expressing neuroblastoma
cell lines displayed SNS-032 IC50 values in the range of
therapeutic SNS-032 concentrations [19].
Here, we established and characterized SNS-032resistant sub-lines of the MYCN-amplified, ABCB1negative neuroblastoma cell line UKF-NB-3 (UKFNB-3rSNS-032300nM) and the non-MYCN-amplified,
ABCB1-expressing neuroblastoma cell line SHEP
(SHEPrSNS-0322000nM) to analyze the role of ABCB1 in
neuroblastoma models of acquired SNS-032 resistance.

resistant UKF-NB-3rSNS-032300nM / IC50 UKF-NB-3
ranged between 2.0 (etoposide) and 10.8 (vincristine)
(Figure 3, Supplementary Table S1A). Addition of
verapamil 10 µM, a concentration that did not affect the
viability of the investigated cell lines (Supplementary
Table S1A), re-sensitized UKF-NB-3rSNS-032300nM to
SNS-032 to the level of the parental UKF-NB-3 cells
as indicated by a fold change IC50 SNS-032 in UKFNB-3rSNS-032300nM cells in the presence of verapamil/
IC50 SNS-032 in UKF-NB-3 cells below 2 (Figure 3,
Supplementary Table S1A). Verapamil also reduced the
doxorubicin, etoposide, and vincristine IC50 values in
UKF-NB-3rSNS-032300nM cells to a level similar to UKFNB-3 (Figure 3; Supplementary Table S1A).
To further confirm the role of ABCB1 in UKF-NB3rSNS-032300nM cells, we depleted ABCB1 using siRNA.
ABCB1 depletion increased SNS-032 sensitivity in UKFNB-3rSNS-032300nM cells. Since no complete suppression
of ABCB1 expression was achieved by siRNA, the
SNS-032 IC50 remained higher than in parental UKFNB-3 cells (Supplementary Table S1B; Supplementary
Figure S4). However, the SNS-032 IC50 value could be
reduced in UKF-NB-3rSNS-032300nM cells to the level of
UKF-NB-3 cells by the use of zosuquidar (Supplementary
Table S1C), an alternative ABCB1 inhibitor that
structurally differs from verapamil [23].
Moreover, we synthesized a fluorescent SNS032-BODIPY derivative. Flow cytometry experiments
indicated, compared to UKF-NB-3, a reduced
accumulation of SNS-032-BODIPY in ABCB1-transduced
UKF-NB-3 (UKF-NB-3ABCB1) cells and UKF-NB3rSNS-032300nM cells that could be restored by the use
of verapamil (Supplementary Figure S5). Notably, the
differences between SNS-032-BODIPY accumulation
in UKF-NB-3rSNS-032300nM cells in the absence or
presence of verapamil seemed to be small compared to the
differences observed in UKF-NB-3ABCB1 cells. However,
this appears to reflect the respective discrepancies in the
SNS-032 IC50 values (UKF-NB-3rSNS-032300nM: 607 nM;
UKF-NB-3ABCB1: 3885 nM).
The doxorubicin-resistant (UKF-NB-3rDOX20),
etoposide-resistant (UKF-NB-3rETO100), and vincristineresistant (UKF-NB-3rVCR10) UKF-NB-3 sub-lines that
express ABCB1 displayed cross-resistance to SNS-032,
doxorubicin, etoposide, and vincristine. Verapamil
decreased the SNS-032 IC50 values in all three cell
lines to a level similar to UKF-NB-3 as indicated by
fold changes (SNS-032 IC50 in resistant cell lines in the
presence of verapamil/ SNS-032 IC50 in UKF-NB-3 cells)
below 2 (Figure 3, Supplementary Table S1A). However,
verapamil did not re-sensitize UKF-NB-3rDOX20, UKFNB-3rETO100, or UKF-NB-3rVCR10 cells to doxorubicin,
etoposide, or vincristine to the level of UKF-NB-3 cells
(Figure 3, Supplementary Table S1A). The only exemption
was the vincristine sensitivity of UKF-NB-3rETO100 cells
(Figure 3, Supplementary Table S1A).

RESULTS
Enhanced ABCB1 expression in the SNS-032resistant UKF-NB-3 sub-line UKF-NB-3rSNS032300nM
UKF-NB-3 cells were adapted to growth in the
presence of SNS-032 300 nM by step-wise increase of
the SNS-032 concentration. No pre-existing resistant
sub-population could be selected by directly applying
SNS-032 300 nM. The SNS-032 IC50 value was four times
higher in SNS-032-adapted UKF-NB-3rSNS-032300nM
cells (606.7 nM) than in UKF-NB-3 cells (152.6 nM).
UKF-NB-3 and its SNS-032-resistant sub-line UKF-NB3rSNS-032300nM were characterized by similar doubling
times (UKF-NB-3: 26.6 ± 8.2 h, UKF-NB-3rSNS-032300nM
32.9 ± 12.8 h) and a similar morphology (Supplementary
Figure S1). However, UKF-NB-3rSNS-032300nM cells
displayed elevated ABCB1 levels relative to UKF-NB-3
cells (Figure 1, Supplementary Figure S2). We had
previously shown that SNS-032 is also a substrate
of ABCG2 (also known as BCRP) [19]. In contrast,
expression of ABCC1 (also known as MRP1), another
relevant ABC transporter known to be involved in cancer
cell drug resistance in various cancer entities including
neuroblastoma [22], did not influence anti-cancer activity of
SNS-032 (Supplementary Figure S3). We did neither detect
increased ABCG2 nor ABCC1 expression in UKF-NB3rSNS-032300nM cells (Figure 1, Supplementary Figure S2).

CDK7 and CDK9 as drug targets in UKF-NB3rSNS-032300nM cells
We had previously shown that SNS-032 reduces the
viability of UKF-NB-3 cells via interference with CDK7
and CDK9 and subsequent RNA polymerase II inhibition
resulting in depletion of anti-apoptotic proteins with a high
turnover rate including Mcl-1, XIAP, and survivin [19].
In the presence of verapamil 10 µM, SNS-032 300 nM
exerted similar effects on RNA polymerase II protein
levels, RNA polymerase II phosphorylation at Ser-5 (target
of CDK7), RNA polymerase II phosphorylation at Ser-2
(target of CDK9) (Figure 5A), RNA polymerase II activity
(Figure 5B), and XIAP, Mcl-1, and survivin protein levels
(Figure 5A) in UKF-NB-3rSNS-032300nM cells as in UKFNB-3 cells.
Moreover, the relative resistances IC50 UKFNB-3rSNS-032300nM/ IC50 UKF-NB-3 were ≤ 1.5 for
the CDK2, 7, and 9 inhibitor seliciclib (also known
as roscovitine or CYC202) [24], the CDK9 inhibitor
LDC000067 [25], the CDK7 inhibitor BS-181 [26], and

We next determined the resistance profile to cisplatin
that is not an ABCB1 substrate. UKF-NB-3rSNS-032300nM
and UKF-NB-3rETO100 did not display cisplatin resistance
(cisplatin IC50 resistant UKF-NB-3 sub-line/ cisplatin IC50
UKF-NB-3 < 2). In contrast, UKF-NB-3rDOX20 and UKFNB-3rVCR10 cells were substantially less sensitive to cisplatin
than UKF-NB-3 cells (Figure 4A; Supplementary Table S1D).
UKF-NB-3rCDDP1000 cells displayed profound
cisplatin resistance (cisplatin IC50: UKF-NB-3, 280 nM;
UKF-NB-3rCDDP1000, 8936 nM, Supplementary Table S1D)
and cross-resistance (fold change IC50 UKF-NB3rCDDP1000/ IC50 UKF-NB-3 ≥ 2) to doxorubicin (fold
change 4.0) and vincristine (fold change 3.3) but not to
SNS-032 (fold change 0.8) or etoposide (fold change 1.6)
(Figure 4B, Supplementary Table S1E).

known as flavopiridol or HMR-1275) [27] (Figure 6A;
Supplementary Table S1F). Finally, UKF-NB-3rSNS032300nM cells were similar sensitive to siRNA-mediated
depletion of CDK7 and CDK9 as UKF-NB-3 cells
(Figure 6B, Supplementary Table S1G). Hence, UKFNB-3rSNS-032300nM cells do not seem to have acquired
specific resistance to CDK inhibition.

we established an SNS-032-resistant SHEP sub-line
(SHEP rSNS-032 2000nM). In contrast to the MYCNamplified neuroblastoma cell line UKF-NB-3, SHEP
cells do not harbor a MYCN amplification. Also in
contrast to UKF-NB-3, SHEP cells express ABCB1
and display a higher SNS-032 IC50 value than UKFNB-3 cells (SHEP 912 nM; UKF-NB-3 153 nM
(Supplementary Table S1A, S1H)). SHEP cells
were adapted to growth in the presence of SNS032 2000 nM by step-wise increase of the SNS-032
concentration. No pre-existing SNS-032-resistant
sub-population could be selected by directly applying
SNS-032 2000 nM.
SHEP and SHEPrSNS-0322000nM cells displayed
similar doubling times (SHEP: 17.9 ± 1.4 h, SHEPrSNS0322000nM 17.9 ± 0.6 h) and a similar morphology

(Supplementary Figure S1). Adaptation of SHEP cells
to SNS-032 resulted in a further increase of the cellular
ABCB1 levels but did not affect ABCG2 or ABCC1
expression levels (Figure 1, Supplementary Figure S2).
Similar to UKF-NB-3rSNS-032300nM cells, (cross-)
resistances predominantly depended on ABCB1 function
in SHEPrSNS-0322000nM cells (Figure 7 and Figure 8A,
Supplementary Table S1H and Supplementary Table S1I).
ABCB1 inhibition using verapamil did not always reduce the
IC50 values for the ABCB1 substrates to the level of parental
SHEP cells in the presence of verapamil. The fold change
IC50 SHEPrSNS-0322000nM/ IC50 SHEP in the presence of
verapamil was close to 2 for SNS-032 (1.98) and doxorubicin
(1.96) and above 2 for etoposide (2.87), while it was 1.45
for vincristine (Figure 7, Supplementary Table S1H). For
the non-ABCB1 substrate cisplatin and the CDK inhibitors

seliciclib, LDC000067, BS-181, and alvocidib the fold
changes IC50 SHEPrSNS-0322000nM/ IC50 SHEP were clearly
below 2 (Figure 8A, Supplementary Table S1I).
In the presence of verapamil, SNS-032 600
nM caused maximum RNA polymerase inhibition in
SHEPrSNS-0322000nM cells (32 ± 4% activity relative
to non-treated control). This effect was not further
enhanced by increasing the SNS-032 concentration
to 1200 nM (31 ± 5% activity relative to non-treated
control) (Figure 8B, Supplementary Table S1J).
In contrast to this, combined SHEP cell treatment
with SNS-032 600 nM and verapamil reduced RNA
polymerase activity to 22 ± 3% relative to untreated
control, which was further decreased by combined
SNS-032 1200 nM and verapamil treatment to
16 ± 3% (Figure 8B, Supplementary Table S1J).

The positive control actinomycin D 100 ng/mL, which
is also an ABCB1 substrate [28] and interferes with
RNA polymerase activity through DNA intercalation
independently of CDK7 and CDK9 [29, 30], exerted
the same activity in SHEP cells (19.1 ± 2.9% relative to
untreated control) and SHEPrSNS-0322000nM cells (19.5
± 2.8% relative to untreated control) in the presence
of verapamil (Figure 8B, Supplementary Table S1J).
These findings suggest that SHEPrSNS-0322000nM cells
have developed mechanisms to specifically compensate
SNS-032-mediated CDK7- and CDK9 inhibition.

in neuroblastoma. Drug-adapted cancer cell lines were
previously successfully used to identify novel clinically
relevant acquired drug resistance mechanisms [33–37].
The resistance status of the SNS-032-resistant
UKF-NB-3 sub-line UKF-NB-3rSNS-032300nM depended
exclusively on ABCB1 function. ABCB1 inhibition
completely re-sensitized UKF-NB-3rSNS-032300nM to
SNS-032 to the level of UKF-NB-3 cells. The same
observation was made for UKF-NB-3rSNS-032300nM
cell sensitivity to the ABCB1 substrates doxorubicin,
etoposide, and vincristine. UKF-NB-3rSNS-032300nM
cells displayed cross-resistance to these agents but
their sensitivity to these drugs returned to the levels of
UKF-NB-3 in the presence of the ABCB1 inhibitor
verapamil. Moreover, UKF-NB-3rSNS-032300nM cells did
not display cross-resistance to the non-ABCB1 substrate
cisplatin or the alternative CDK inhibitors seliciclib,
LDC000067, BS-181, or alvocidib. Previous results
had demonstrated that SNS-032 reduces the viability of
UKF-NB-3 cells (and other cancer cells) via interference
with CDK7 and CDK9 and subsequent RNA polymerase
II inhibition resulting in depletion of anti-apoptotic
proteins with a high turnover rate including Mcl-1, XIAP,
and survivin [7 ,8, 19]. In the presence of the ABCB1

DISCUSSION
To study acquired SNS-032 resistance mechanisms,
we established two SNS-032-resistant neuroblastoma cell
lines. Elevated ABCB1 expression represented, depending
on the investigated cell line model, a dominant or even
exclusive acquired SNS-032 resistance mechanism.
In the clinics, few neuroblastomas appear to express
ABCB1 at diagnosis [31]. However, ABCB1 expression
might represent an acquired resistance mechanism in
neuroblastoma [32]. In addition, ABCB1 expression may
be an SNS-032-associated acquired resistance mechanism

inhibitor verapamil, SNS-032 exerted similar effects on
CDK7, CDK9, and RNA polymerase II activity as well
as on the cellular levels of Mcl-1, XIAP, and survivin
in UKF-NB-3rSNS-032300nM and in UKF-NB-3 cells.
Moreover, UKF-NB-3rSNS-032300nM and UKF-NB-3
cells did not differ in their sensitivity to siRNA-mediated
depletion of CDK7 and CDK9. Taken together, these
findings demonstrate that ABCB1 expression represents
an exclusive resistance mechanism in UKF-NB-3rSNS032300nM cells.
ABCB1 expression as sole resistance mechanism is
unusual even among UKF-NB-3 sub-lines with acquired
resistance to ABCB1 substrates. The ABCB1-expressing
drug-resistant UKF-NB-3 sub-lines UKF-NB-3rDOX20,
UKF-NB-3rETO100, and UKF-NB-3rVCR10 maintained

a substantial level of resistance to the respective drug of
adaptation even when ABCB1 was inhibited. In addition,
UKF-NB-3rDOX20 and UKF-NB-3rVCR10 cells were
(in contrast to UKF-NB-3rSNS-032300nM cells) less
sensitive to the non-ABCB1 substrate cisplatin than UKFNB-3 cells. These findings demonstrate that UKF-NB3rDOX20, UKF-NB-3rVCR10, and UKF-NB-3rETO100 cells
have developed further resistance mechanisms in addition
to increased ABCB1 expression.
The investigation of the second SNS-032-resistant
neuroblastoma cell line SHEPrSNS-0322000nM resulted
in slight but noticeable differences. We had selected the
neuroblastoma cell line SHEP as additional model for
our study because it differs in two crucial parameters
from UKF-NB-3: 1) SHEP cells do not harbor a MYCN

amplification, a major marker of high-risk neuroblastoma
[1 ,2], and 2) SHEP cells are characterized by intrinsic
ABCB1 expression. SHEPrSNS-0322000nM cells retained
some low-level resistance to SNS-032 and doxorubicin
(about 2-fold decreased sensitivity compared to SHEP) and
some more pronounced resistance to etoposide (2.9-fold
relative to SHEP) also in the presence of verapamil. This
demonstrates that SHEPrSNS-0322000nM cells have acquired
other resistance mechanisms in addition to ABCB1
expression. SNS-032 also exerted decreased effects on
RNA polymerase activity in SHEPrSNS-0322000nM cells than
in SHEP cells when ABCB1 was inhibited. However, both
cell lines displayed in the presence of the ABCB1 inhibitor
verapamil the same sensitivity to RNA polymerase
inhibition by actinomycin D that is also an ABCB1
substrate [28] and interferes with RNA polymerase activity
by CDK7- and CDK9-independent mechanisms [29,
30]. These findings are again in contrast to observations
in UKF-NB-3rSNS-032300nM cells and indicate that
SHEPrSNS-0322000nM cells developed mechanisms to bypass
SNS-032-induced CDK7 and 9 inhibition and subsequent
RNA polymerase activity but no general resistance to
RNA polymerase inhibition. This specific resistance to
RNA polymerase inhibition via interference with CDK7
and 9 also confirms CDK7 and 9 as critical drug targets of
SNS-032 in neuroblastoma that was previously suggested
[19]. Hence, drug-adapted cells can be used to identify and
confirm drug mechanisms of action.

A likely explanation for the differences observed
between the resistance phenotypes of UKF-NB3rSNS-032300nM and SHEPrSNS-0322000nM cells is that
SHEPrSNS-0322000nM cells were adapted to higher SNS032 concentrations. While non-ABCB1 expressing UKFNB-3 cells are highly sensitive to SNS-032 (IC50 153 nM),
ABCB1-expressing SHEP cells display an IC50 value of
912 nM, which is above the therapeutically achievable
SNS-032 plasma concentration of 754 nM [14]. Therefore,
SHEP cells were adapted to growth in the presence of a
much higher SNS-032 concentration (2000 nM) than
UKF-NB-3 cells (300 nM). The SNS-032 IC50 of UKFNB-3rSNS-032300nM cells (607 nM) remained below the
SNS-032 IC50 of parental SHEP cells, whereas the SNS032 IC50 of SHEPrSNS-0322000nM cells (5045 nM) was
about 8-fold higher than that of UKF-NB-3rSNS-032300nM
cells. Thus, it does not appear implausible that UKF-NB3rSNS-032300nM cells might develop additional resistance
mechanisms if they were further adapted to higher SNS032 concentrations.
It remains unclear why SHEPrSNS-0322000nM cells
did not display cross-resistance to the other CDK inhibitors
investigated. It is known that kinase inhibitors designed to
interfere with the same or similar targets may substantially
differ in their overall pharmacological profiles (with
regards to kinase inhibition as well as other structures) [8,
10, 38–42]. Hence, the lack of cross-resistance may not
be too surprising. The inhibitory profiles of the different

CDK inhibitors differ with regard to their CDK inhibitory
profiles. Seliciclib interferes (in contrast to SNS-032) with
CDK5 in addition to CDK2, CDK7, and CDK9 [24, 43].
BS-181 does in contrast to SNS-032 not inhibit CDK9
[26]. LDC000067 was introduced as selective CDK9
inhibitor with negligible affinity to alternative CDKs [25].
Alvocidib is a broad spectrum CDK inhibitor acting on
CDKs 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9 [27].
Notably, cisplatin-resistant (UKF-NB-3rCDDP1000),
doxorubicin-resistant
(UKF-NB-3rDOX20),
and
vincristine-resistant (UKF-NB-3rVCR10) UKF-NB-3
sub-lines remained sensitive to seliciclib, LDC000067,
BS-181, and alvocidib (Supplementary Table S1K) further

supporting a possible role of CDKs as drug targets in
neuroblastoma including therapy-refractory disease as
previously suggested [17–19]. The alvocidib IC50s were
below 400 nM. In phase I clinical trials, steady-state
plasma alvocidib concentrations > 400 µM were achieved
in human patients [44].
In conclusion, we show that ABCB1 expression
represents the predominant resistance mechanism
in neuroblastoma cells with acquired resistance to
SNS-032. Most strikingly (and in clear contrast to
neuroblastoma cell lines with acquired resistance to
other anti-cancer agents that are ABCB1 substrates),
ABCB1 expression is an exclusive resistance mechanism

in UKF-NB-3rSNS-032300nM cells and a predominant
resistance mechanism in SHEPrSNS-0322000nM cells.
Although selective ABCB1 inhibitors are available
[45, 46], clinical trials were disappointing. Reasons
included that ABCB1 transporter inhibition may affect
ABCB1-expressing hematopoietic stem cells and the
body distribution of drugs due to effects on ABCB1
present on tissue barriers (e.g. the blood-brain-barrier).
Also cancer cells may express multiple ABC transporters
[45, 46]. However, ABCB1 expression represents the
dominant (sometimes exclusive) resistance mechanism
to SNS-032 in neuroblastoma. Therefore, ABCB1

inhibitors may be candidates for combination therapy
with SNS-032 that increase SNS-032 efficacy through
(re)sensitization of ABCB1-expressing cancer cells,
possibly reducing resistance formation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

SNS-032, BS-181, and LDC000067 were purchased
from Selleck Chemicals via BIOZOL GmbH (Eching,
Germany), seliciclib from LC Laboratories (Woburn,

increasing drug concentrations as described previously
[19, 47, 49]. All neuroblastoma cell lines with acquired
drug resistance were derived from the resistant cancer cell
line (RCCL) collection. The corresponding IC50 values for
the parental cells and their drug-resistant sub-lines were
provided previously [19, 50]. All cells were propagated in
IMDM supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum (FCS),
100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin at 37°C.
Cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination
and authenticated by short tandem repeat profiling.
UKF-NB-3 cells were transduced with lentiviral
vectors encoding for ABCB1 (also known as MDR1 or
P-glycoprotein) or ABCG2 (also known as BCRP) as
described previously [50, 51] using the Lentiviral Gene
Ontology (LeGO) vector technology [52] (www.lentigovectors.de).

Synthesis and characterisation of SNS-032BODIPY
SNS-032-BODIPY was synthesized using SNS-032
(Selleck Chemicals) and BDP-FL-NHS-ester (Lumiprobe,
Hannover, Germany) (Supplementary Figure S7A). All
other reagents and solvents were purchased from Fisher
Scientific (Loughborough, UK). NMR spectra were
collected on a JEOL 400 MHz. HRMS were collected on
a Bruker MicroTOFQ spectrometer by direct injection
with a MeOH/HCOOH matrix. Excitation and emission
spectra were collected on an Edinburgh Instruments FS-5
spectrofluorimeter. HPLC traces were collected on a
Dionex U3000 HPLC apparatus.
To 7.68 mg (2.02 × 10-2 mmol) of SNS-032
chloroform (1.3 mL) was added and the mixture sonicated
until dossolution. BDP-FL NHS ester (purchased
from Lumiprobe; 8.09 mg, 2.08 × 10-2 mmol) was also
dissolved in chloroform (1.3mL) and sonicated to ensure
dissolution. The SNS-032 mixture was added to BDPFL and the resulting sample was sonicated for 1 h.
Reaction was monitored using thin-layer chromatography
(dichloromethane: methanol – 4:0.1; product rf: 0.21).
Reaction mixture was concentrated and then purified
by preparative TLC using the above noted eluent. The
adsorbed product band on the silica plate was scraped,
isolated and rinsed repeatedly with acetonitrile to extract the
product yielding 9.0 mg (1.38 × 10-2 mmol; 68%). Purity
was confirmed by reverse-phase HPLC (Figure 7B–7E).

Viability assay
Cell viability was tested either by the
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) dye reduction assay after 120 h incubation
modified as described previously [47, 50].

Determination of ABCB1, ABCG2, and ABCC1
expression
The ABC-transporters ABCB1, ABCC1, and
ABCG2 were detected by flow cytometry as described
previously [51] using specific primary antibodies against
ABCB1 (Alexis Biochemicals via AXXORA Deutschland,
Lörrach, Germany), ABCC1, and ABCG2 (Kamiya
Biomedical Company, Seattle, Washington) and secondary
phycoerythrin(PE)-labelled goat anti-mouse antibody (PE,
R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany).

RNA interference experiments
Synthetic
siRNAoligonucletides
targeting
CDK7, CDK9, ABCC1, or ABCB1 (ONTARGETplusSMARTpoolsiRNAs) were purchased from
Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO, USA). The non-targeting
siRNA ON-TARGETplusSMARTpool (Dharmacon) was
used as negative control. Transfections were performed
using the NeonTM Transfection System (Invitrogen,
Darmstadt, Germany) according to the manufacturer´s
protocol. UKF-NB-3 cells or UKF-NB-3rSNS032300nM cells were grown to about 60-80% confluence,
trypsinized and 2 × 106 cells were re-suspended in
200 µl of resuspension buffer containing 2.5 µM siRNA.
Electroporation was performed in a pipette tip chamber
with previously optimized adjustments (voltage 1400,
width 20, 2 pulses). After electroporation, the cells were
transferred into fibronectin (100 μg/ml)–coated well plates
containing pre-warmed IMDM plus 10% FCS.

Cell lines
The MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell line
UKF-NB-3 was established from a stage 4 neuroblastoma
patient [44]. SHEP cells [45] were kindly provided by Dr.
Angelika Eggert (Universität Duisburg-Essen, Germany).
Neuroblastoma cell lines were adapted to growth in the
presence of anti-cancer drugs by continuous exposure to

Flow cytometry
Cells were incubated with SNS-032-BODIPY for 45
min at 37°C. Then, the cells were washed twice with PBS
before fresh medium was added. The cellular fluorescence
was analysed after a further 120 minutes using a FACS
Canto (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany) using the
FL1 channel. In verapamil-treated cells, verapamil was
continuously present throughout the experiments including
a pre-incubation period of 30 minutes at 37°C prior to the
addition of SNS-032-BODIPY.
