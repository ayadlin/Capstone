Abstract:

The development of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors for clinical use in non-small cell
lung cancer and the subsequent discovery of activating EGFR mutations have led
to an explosion of knowledge in the fields of EGFR biology, targeted therapeutics
and lung cancer research. EGFR-mutated adenocarcinoma of the lung has clearly
emerged as a unique clinical entity necessitating the routine introduction of molecular
diagnostics into our current diagnostic algorithms and leading to the evidence-based
preferential usage of EGFR-targeted agents for patients with EGFR-mutant lung
cancers. This review will summarize our current understanding of the functional
role of activating mutations, key downstream signaling pathways and regulatory
mechanisms, pivotal primary and acquired resistance mechanisms, structurefunction relationships and ultimately the incorporation of molecular diagnostics and
small molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors into our current treatment paradigms.

roles of the EGFR family proteins are supported by a
series of knockout mouse studies. Mice lacking EGFR
die between day 11.5 of gestation and day 20 after birth,
depending on their genetic backgrounds [4]. Analyses
of the knockout mice reveal placental defects and lung
immaturity, both of which can be the causes of death.
They also show abnormalities in the bone, brain, heart,
and various epithelial organs such as gastrointestinal
tract, skin, hair follicles and eyes [4]. Detailed analyses
show that deletion of EGFR leads to impaired branching
and deficient alveolization and septation in lungs [5]. In
addition, type II pneumocytes are immature, and there is a
lack of response in up-regulation of surfactant protein C in
mice lacking EGFR [5]. Mice lacking ERBB2 , ERBB3, or
ERBB4 are embryonic lethal and have defects in cardiac

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
family, a member of the subclass I of the transmembrane
receptor tyrosine kinase superfamily, consists of four
closely related members: EGFR/ERBB1/HER1, ERBB2/
HER2, ERBB3/HER3, and ERBB4/HER4 [1]. The
founder member, EGFR was first identified as a 170-kDa
protein on the membrane of A431 epidermoid cells and
other ERBB members were identified by screening of
cDNA libraries for EGFR related molecules [2,3]. These
receptors are normally expressed in various tissues of
epithelial, mesenchymal, and neural origin. The crucial

and neuronal development [4]. In mammals, eleven growth
factors bind to the ERBB receptors: EGF, transforming
growth factor α (TGFα), heparin-binding EGF-like growth
factor, amphiregulin, beta-cellulin, epiregulin, epigen, and
neuregulin1-4, of which seven are ligands of EGFR [6,7].
Upon binding, the ERBB receptors form homo- or heterodimers, resulting in autophosphorylation of the receptors.
Of note, mice lacking EGF show no overt phenotype
[8]. Mice lacking TGFα show hair follicle, skin, and eye
abnormalities, however, they are viable and fertile [9,10].
These observations indicate that there is a high level of
redundancy among ligands.
Given the pivotal roles of the ERBB receptors in
normal development, one can imagine that dysregulation
of these genes or proteins can lead to tumorigenesis.
Indeed, EGFR is overexpressed in a variety of human
cancers including lung, head and neck, colon, pancreas,
breast, ovary, bladder and kidney, and gliomas
[11,12]. More than 60% of non-small cell lung cancers
(NSCLCs) show EGFR overexpression, whereas no
overexpression is detected in small cell lung cancer [13].
The overexpression of EGFR is presumably caused by
multiple epigenetic mechanisms, gene amplification, and
oncogenic viruses [11]. It has been shown that EGFR
expression is associated with poor prognosis [14]. In
addition to EGFRs themselves, the EGFR ligands may
also play an important role in lung tumorigenesis. EGF,
TGFα, and amphiregulin are expressed in NSCLCs, and
activate EGFR and its downstream signaling pathways
by autocrine loops [15]. In addition, a distinct ligand for
ERBB3 and ERBB4, called neuregulin-1 is overexpressed
in NSCLC [15].

The EGFR protien consists of three regions:
an extracellular ligand-binding region, a single
transmembrane helix region, and a cytoplasmic region. The
tyrosine kinase domain accounts for approximately 50%
of the cytoplasmic region, with the remainder composed
of the 38 amino acid cytoplasmic juxtamembrane (JM)
region and the 225 amino acid carboxyl terminal (CT)
region [16]. As shown in Figure 1, mutations in the EGFR
gene cluster in specific areas, suggesting that these areas
are crucial for receptor function or regulation.

EGFR
mutationsbiochemistry

A recent study revealed that there is a domain in the
EGFR juxtamembrane region that plays an activating role.
This JM activating domain seems to enhance formation
of the asymmetric dimer, thereby promoting allosteric
activation of the acceptor kinase domain (see “Structural
Implicatons” section below). Several rare mutations in
this domain have been identified in NSCLC patients.
Two of these missense mutants, V689M and L703F are
constitutively active, possibly because they stabilize
acceptor/donor interactions [16].

Domain

Extracellular domain

Mutations in the extracellular region
It has been shown that there are three major types of
deletion mutations in the extracellular region depending
on the site and length of deletions: EGFR vI, EGFR
vII, and EGFR vIII. They were originally discovered in
gliomas [17]. Of these mutant forms, EGFR vIII is the
most common mutation in gliomas (30-50%) and has
been extensively studied since its discovery in 1990 [3].
This mutant lacks a large part of the extracellular portion
including the ligand-binding region, leading to constitutive
dimerization and activation of the receptor. This mutation
is detected in 5% of lung squamous cell carcinomas, but
not in other non-small cell histologies [18]. In addition to
the deletions, novel missense mutations in the extracellular
domain have been reported in 13.6% in glioblastomas;
however, these point mutations have not been found in
lung tumors with any frequency [19].

A tandem kinase duplication in the tyrosine kinase
domain has been described in glioblastomas. This mutant
is constitutively active and confers tumorigenicity [20].
In lung cancer, a series of mutations in the kinase domain
was originally identified in correlation with sensitivity to
EGFR inhibitors. Two anilinoquinazoline EGFR tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKIs), gefitinib and erlotinib, were
approved for use in unselected patients with NSCLC in the
2nd and 3rd line setting after failure of first line platinumOncotarget 2010; 1: 497 - 514

survival and anti-apoptotic signals through down-stream
targets as discussed below. In contrast to the activating
mutations above, a secondary mutation was identified
as a single base pair change leading to a threonine to
methionine (T790M) amino acid alteration in exon 20 as
a mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors.
It accounts for more than 50% of primarily EGFR TKIsensitive lung tumors which become resistant to EGFR
inhibitors[32,33]. Other resistance mutations in exon 19,
such as D761Y and L747S, have been reported [34,35];
however, these mutations seem to be rare. These EGFR
kinase domain mutations and other kinase mutations such
as K-RAS mutations usually exhibit a mutually exclusive
pattern in NSCLC, suggesting that the EGFR kinase
mutations per se are responsible for initiating tumors.
In gliomas, two forms of deletion mutants in the
carboxyl terminal region have been reported. EGFR vIV
harbors an in-frame deletion and EGFR vV has a carboxyl
terminal truncation [17](Fig. 1). These mutants seem to
be constitutively active: computational analyses suggest
that this is due to the fact that the deleted region has an
inhibitory effect on kinase activity [36]. However, these
mutants have not been reported in lung cancer.

based chemotherapy in 2003 and 2004, respectively in the
United States [21] and some patients were noted to have
major and sometimes durable responses [22]. The selective
response of a fraction of NSCLC to these agents can be
explained by somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase
domain of EGFR in most patients with NSCLC responsive
to gefitinib or erlotinib [23-25]. EGFR mutations are more
common in NSCLC from tumors with adenocarcinoma
histology, women, Asians, and never smokers with
widely varying frequencies dependent on the population
examined [26-28]. EGFR mutations are rarely found in
squamous cell carcinomas of the lung, small cell lung
cancer or other epithelial malignancies. Thus, activating
somatic EGFR mutations are a unique feature of a subclass of NSCLC. The most prevalent EGFR mutations
consist of small inframe deletions around the conserved
LREA motif of exon 19 (residues 747-750) and a point
mutation (L858R) in exon 21 [21], which account for more
than 90% of all EGFR kinase mutations. Oncogenecity
of the exon 19 deletion and the L858R mutation has
been shown in inducible mouse models [29,30]. Point
mutations in exon 18, predominantly at G719 account for
approximately another 5% of EGFR mutations [15]. Inframe insertions and point mutations in exon 20 account
for 5% of the mutations, which are rather insensitive
to reversible EGFR inhibitors but might be sensitive
to irreversible EGFR inhibitors, such as CL-387,785
[15,31]. These EGFR mutations activate the EGFR
signaling pathway and promote EGFR-mediated pro-

and multiple other ligands) to its extracellular domain,
EGFR forms dimers with itself and other members of the
ErbB family via specific dimerization domains [37,38],
which induces conformational shifts that promote tyrosine
autophosphorylation in the activation loop of EGFR and
consequent kinase activation leading to stimulation of
intracellular signaling cascades such as the RAS/RAF/
ERK, PI3K/Akt, and STAT signaling pathways (Fig. 2).
The EGFR family mediated signaling pathways have
been shown to be important for proper regulation of many
developmental, metabolic, and physiologic processes
mediated by EGF, TGFα, and multiple other ligands. In
numerous cancers, including glioblastomas, colon cancer,
breast cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer, the output
of the EGFR pathway is commonly increased by genetic
mutation and overexpression of the receptor, overactivity
of its ligands or cofactors and less commonly reduced
inhibition through loss of its negative regulatory pathways
driving the mitogenic, antiapoptotic, angiogenic and proinvasive behaviour of the cancer cells. EGFR-targeted
drugs including tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as erlotinib
and gefitinib, are primarily used in lung cancer treatment
producing significant clinical responses in 10% to 30%
of all NSCLC patients [32,39,40] and currently used as
first line therapy for lung cancers with EGFR mutations
achieving about 70% response rates [41,42]. Humanized
monoclonal antibodies against the extracellular structure
of EGFR such as cetuximab and panitumumab, are
primarily used in colorectal cancer and head/neck cancer
[43] and will not be further discussed in this review.
Inhibition of key signalling mediators downstream of
EGFR should also lead to clinical effects in the treatment
of lung cancer with robust EGFR activity. Therefore,
identification and understanding critical downstream
effectors of oncogenic EGFR variants should help to
develop new treatment targets and in fact, a large number
of pharmacological inhibitors against those key mediators
are under intensive basic and clinical investigations as
summarized below. The pivotal ERK1/2-MAPK and
PI3K/AKT pathways play critical roles in gefitinib/
erlotinib-induced antitumor effects in NSCLC cell lines
and tumors with EGFR addiction [44,45]. However,
inhibitors directly targeting ERK1/2 or PI3K/AKT have
not been evaluated carefully in clinic yet.

[47].

Bim
Bim, a proapoptotic BH3-only Bcl-2 family
polypeptide and also known as BCL2-like 11, has
been shown to be a key downstream effector of EGFR
signalling by several groups [35,48,49]. Bim expression
was significantly induced by EGFR TKI inhibition in
gefitinib-sensitive EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells through
both transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms.
Knockdown of Bim by small interfering RNA was able to
attenuate apoptosis induced by EGFR TKIs, and addition
of a BH3 mimetic enhanced gefitinib-induced apoptosis,
suggesting that inducing Bim or use of BH3 mimetics
may give rise to similar effects to inhibition of EGFR by
promoting apoptosis and even overcoming EGFR TKI
treatment resistance in lung cancer.

Cyclin D1
Cyclin D1 forms a complex with and functions as
a regulatory subunit of CDK4 or CDK6, whose activity
is required for cell cycle G1/S transition. Cyclin D1 has
been identified as a key downstream effector of EGFR
signalling by using microarray transcriptional profiling of
gefitinib-resistant NSCLC EGFR L858R-T790M mutant
H1975 cells exposed to the irreversible and in these cells
still effective inhibitor, CL-387,785 versus gefitinib.
Cyclin D1 was highly suppressed by CL-387,785 but not
by gefitinib and downregulation of cyclin D1 resulted
in suppression of E2F-responsive genes, consistent with
proliferation arrest. EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells have
higher expression of cyclin D1 than cells with wild-type
EGFR and are sensitive to the cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor flavopiridol [50]. Cyclin D1 has also been
introduced as an important biomarker among EGFR,
K-RAS and VEGFR in the BATTLE trial focusing on
personalized therapy for lung cancer [51].

Dual-specificity phosphatases
MAPK signalling is negatively regulated by a family
of dual-specificity MAPK phosphatases, known as DUSPs
or MKPs [52]. A nuclear-inducible DUSP1 has been
reported to be a critical downstream effector of EGFR
inhibition by AG1478 in PC9 cells. Downregulation
of DUSP1 correlated with AG1478-induced apoptosis
in PC9 cells via activation of JNK kinase activity,
whereas overexpression of DUSP1 led to resistance to
AG1478 of PC9 cells [53]. DUSP4 and DUSP6 have
been well described as transcriptional targets of EGFRERK1/2 signalling and demonstrated as novel tumor
growth suppressors in NSCLC [45,50,54]. In particular,

mTOR
mTOR is an important downstream effector of the
PI3K/AKT signalling pathway and mTOR inhibitors
can effectively block growth and survival signals by
inactivating downstream effectors such as p70S6K and
4E-binding protein 1 [46]. mTOR represents an attractive
target because its inhibition could allow avoidance of
possible side effects associated with inhibition of upstream
PI3K/AKT signaling molecules with broader biological
functions, including those involved in glucose signaling

confers primary resistance to EGFR TKIs.

genetically mediated loss of DUSP4 correlates closely
with EGFR mutations suggestive of the cooperative nature
of the two independent events. Due to their functional
negative feedback roles in regulation of MAPKs, many
DUSP family members may serve as potential targets for
lung cancer therapy.

Resistant EGFR mutants
Multiple EGFR mutations have also been implicated
in primary resistance to EGFR TKIs, such as the presence
of insertion mutations in exon 20 of EGFR that precludes
the binding of gefitinib or erlotinib to the EGFR TK domain
conferring resistance [61]. Somatic exon 20 insertions are
also detected in ErbB2 in NSCLC and similarly appear
to confer resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib [61]. Even
though the exon 20 insertions represent less than 5% of
all known mutations in the EGFR gene, strategies aimed
at overcoming resistance induced by exon 20 insertions of
EGFR and ErbB2 have been studied by use of irreversible
inhibitors of EGFR and ERBB2 as well as heat shock
protein-90 inhibitors, in that interaction with HSP-90
seems to be required for stability of mutated EGFR and
ErbB2 and HSP-90 inhibitors promote mutated EGFR
degradation [62,63].

Other targets
Some signalling pathways transduced by receptor
tyrosine kinases other than EGFR may also play important
roles in EGFR-addicted NSCLC and could serve as
targets for therapeutic purpose. Recent studies have
demonstrated close crosstalk between EGFR and MET
[55]. Aberrant EGFR hyperactivation results in increased
MET expression in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells via HIF1α activation but EGFR TKI resistance-rendering MET
amplification could uncouple MET levels from the EGFR
signalling pathway [56]. MET has been shown to be a
key downstream mediator of EGFR-induced invasiveness
in EGFR-dependent NSCLC cells, suggesting that
therapeutic inhibition of MET in combination with EGFR
blockade may prevent tumor metastasis beyond the effect
of EGFR alone in a subset of lung cancers, in addition
to the potential benefit of preventing the emergence of
resistance through MET amplification [57].

Primary and
resistance

secondary

K-RAS
K-RAS belongs to the RAS family of oncogenes
and accounts for more than 90% of RAS mutations in
NSCLC. K-RAS mutations have been detected in 15-30%
of NSCLC, with the majority occurring in codons 12 and
13, in particular codon 12 (>90%). The mutations lead
to impaired GTPase activity and subsequent constitutive
activation of RAS signaling, which is downstream
of EGFR leading to activation of proliferative and
anti-apoptotic pathways such as the ERK signaling
pathway. K-RAS mutations have been demonstrated to
be significantly associated with primary resistance to
EGFR-TKIs in a wide variety of tumor types including
lung cancer [64-67]. K-RAS mutations present more
commonly in adenocarcinomas from elderly patients
and heavy smokers who have been identified as a group
unlikely to respond to EGFR TKIs [68]. Development
of effective K-RAS inhibitors remains one of the most
daunting challenges for current tumor therapeutics.

EGFR

Primary and acquired drug resistances are key issues
in the area of targeted therapeutics. Despite overexpression
of EGFR in the majority of lung tumors, only a small
fraction of patients responds significantly to EGFR
inhibition and the majority of tumors demonstrate primary
resistance. Activating mutations of EGFR correlate with
exquisite sensitivity to growth inhibition by erlotinib or
gefitinib, but patients ultimately develop progressive
disease after a typical period of 6-12 months indicating
the development of resistance to these agents [58].

Primary resistance

Other mechanisms

Primary resistance affects patients who are initially
refractory to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment.
Certain molecular factors have been identified as predictive
of EGFR TKI response in lung cancers, such as increased
EGFR gene copy number and activating mutations within
the EGFR TK domain [30,59,60]. Thus, patients without
these characteristics are more likely to present with
primary resistance to EGFR TKIs. The recent IPASS study
reported that Asian NSCLC patients containing wild-type
EGFR had a shorter time to progression to EGFR TKIs as
compared to the outcome of patients treated with classical
chemotherapy and a very low response rate of 2% [41],
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Other less clearly validated markers for primary
resistance to EGFR TKIs include loss of PTEN, BRAF
mutations, increased expression of MAPK, ABCG2,
IGFR1, and BCL-2, and angiogenesis regulators [69].
Expression level of steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC3) has recently been shown to inversely correlate with
resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib in 48 NSCLC cell lines
using the reverse-phase protein array technique, whereas
high SRC-3 protein level correlates with resistance to the

TKIs [70]. ALK translocations represented by EML4ALK fusion are found to be mutually exclusive with EGFR
or K-Ras mutations and predict for primary resistance
to EGFR TKIs in patients with advanced NSCLC since
EGFR output is not key to cell survival in these tumors
[71]. An emerging concept about cancer stem cell (CSC)
or cancer-initiating cells has been proposed as a potential
mechanism of primary drug-resistance [72]. Signalling
pathways involving TGF-β, Wnt, Notch, Hedgehog,
PI3K/PTEN/mTOR, IGF-1R, histone demethylase, and
histone deacetylase (HDAC) have been implicated in CSC
self-renewal, maintenance, and plasticity [72,73]. It is
postulated that any strategy aimed at killing the abundant
non-stem cancer cells will fail without eradicating the few
CSCs in a tumor. These cancer stem cells might be less
dependent on growth pathways, such as the EGFR pathway
and might survive drug inhibition. Acquired resistance is
indeed hypothesized by some to emerge in this quiescent
stem cell population over time by the acquisition of
secondary mutations for example. Potentially those key
regulators involved in the CSC programming may act as
effective targets for drug development to overcome the
primary resistance to anticancer drugs including resistance
to EGFR-targeted therapy in lung cancer.

pocket not only interrupting the physicochemical binding
of gefitinib/erlotinib, but also leading to much increased
affinity of the EGFR protein to ATP resulting in resistance
to EGFR-TKIs [76]. Resistance to the T790M mutation
in lung cancer could be overcome in vitro by irreversible
EGFR small molecule inhibitors such as CL-387,785 [77]
and BIBW2992 [78], Hsp90 inhibition [79], combination
of multiple RTK inhibitor and mTOR inhibitor [80],
combination of TS-targeting drugs (5-fluorouracil or
pemetrexed) and BIBW2992 [81], and novel mutantselective EGFR kinase inhibitors [82].

MET amplification
The second major mechanism of acquired resistance
reported is the amplification of the MET oncogene that
activates ERBB3/PI3K/AKT signalling in lung cancer
[57]. MET amplification was found in 4 of 18 lung cancer
biopsy samples obtained from patients with acquired
resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib [57]. Preclinical data
suggests that combination of EGFR and MET TKIs can
be a treatment strategy for EGFR mutated NSCLC either
delaying acquired resistance or for the treatment of tumors
with co-existing EGFR activating mutations and MET
amplification [83,84].

Acquired resistance

Other mechanisms

Acquired resistance generally affects patients who
initially respond to treatment but subsequently experience
a loss of response [74]. As EGFR TKIs are now proven
as standard first-line therapy for NSCLC patients with
EGFR mutations [41,42], a rapidly growing number of
patients with acquired resistance will be encountered.
Accordingly, a clinical definition of acquired resistance to
EGFR TKIs has been established for unifying therapy and
studying this subset of lung cancer [75].

Given that T790M and MET amplification
collectively account for approximately 60% of the
acquired resistance cases, there are clearly additional
mechanisms that underlie resistance to EGFR TKIs.
Other mechanisms that have been implicated in acquired
resistance include overexpression of AXL tyrosine kinase
receptor [85], altered EGFR trafficking [86], expression of
insulin-like growth factor-1 [87], amplification of mutant
EGFR or hyperactivation of components of downstream
signaling pathways [88], and expression of the ABCG2
drug-efflux transporter [89]. Recently, it has been shown
that activation of TGF-β/IL-6 signaling leads to epithelialto-mesenchymal transition and erlotinib resistance [90].
Targeting key EGFR-downstream signalling pathways
should be an alternative approach for overcoming
resistance to erlotinib or gefitinib in lung cancers. For
example, the mTOR inhibitor, everolimus, has been shown
to reduce the expression of EGFR signalling effectors and
cooperates with gefitinib to overcome resistance [91], and
the combination of an mTOR inhibitor and an irreversible
EGFR inhibitor may be an effective strategy to overcome
EGFR TKI resistance.

Secondary EGFR mutations
The acquisition of resistance to the targeted inhibition
of kinases in cancer is by now a well-documented
phenomenon in several cancer types. Although the
importance of the cancer stem cell is firmly established
for primary drug resistance, the etiology of acquired
resistance is still the subject of some debate. As compared
to the large number of secondary resistance mutations
noted in acquired imatinib resistance in CML, in the case
of EGFR-TK, there are currently only several documented
resistance point mutations to gefitinib and erlotinib,
including T790M [32,33], L747S [35] and D761Y [34].
The T790M point mutation in the EGFR kinase domain
has been reported to be the most common secondary
resistance mutation, accounting for about 50% of tumors
relapsed from prior TKI therapy [33]. The T790M mutation
results in alteration of the topology of the ATP-binding

mainly of beta-strands. In the transition between inactive
and active states for protein kinases, conformational
changes usually occur in the N-terminal lobe that
reposition the catalytic residues to the correct spatial
locations that favor phosphotransfer. Conformational
changes associated with activation also often occur within
a short region of the kinase domain termed the activation
segment. Autoinhibitory conformations of protein kinases
are well described by structural biology studies and
have proven to be diverse among the family; however,
the spatial orientation of residues required for catalytic
competency is very well conserved. While the structural
diversity of inactive states among protein kinases provides
well-documented therapeutic targets (imatinib targets an
inactive conformation of BCR-Abl), structural similarities
in kinase active state conformations can lead to difficulties
in achieving specificity in kinase-targeted drug discovery.
In a general sense, the acquisition of transforming point
mutations for this class of proteins disrupts the normal
active-inactive balance to favor the active state.
In the EGFR family of receptor tyrosine kinases,
the specific mechanisms of normal kinase regulation
are now well-defined by structural biology techniques
[92,93]. Extracellular conformational rearrangement
upon ligand (e.g. EGF) binding allows dimerization of
the receptor, the consequence of which is the ability of
the cytoplasmic kinase domains to trans-activate (Fig.
3). Activated EGFR kinase is able to autophosphorylate
the C-terminal tail, thereby creating recruitment sites for
phosphotyrosine-binding domains of downstream proteins
in EGFR signaling cascades. Until recently the atomiclevel mechanisms of EGFR trans-activation were not

EGFR activation
Normal regulation of EGFR family receptor
tyrosine kinases comprises a precise orchestration of
interconnecting components. Acquired mutations (Fig.
1), even of single amino acids, can deleteriously alter
the choreography of regulation; however, it is these
acquired mutations that provide a therapeutic entry-point
for targeted inhibition of dysregulated EGFR signaling.
Regulation of EGFR family signal transduction is one of
the most comprehensively studied of the receptor tyrosine
kinase family at the atomic-level, and current structural
studies are still providing surprising and exciting new
information about their regulation. Principal among
these recent findings is the discovery that an asymmetric
homodimer assembly is critical for kinase activation.
This, alongside studies investigating the structures of
activating and resistance mutations in the kinase domain
itself, has recently provided a far clearer understanding of
the mechanisms of EGFR family activation and resistance
to small molecule inhibitors.
The catalytic portion of the EGFR family comprises
a cytoplasmic domain with a protein kinase fold. This fold
generally functions to catalyze phosphotransfer of the
ATP γ-phosphate to target protein substrates primarily on
tyrosine, serine and threonine residues. The protein kinase
fold is a bi-lobed domain that includes a C-terminal lobe
rich in alpha-helices and an N-terminal lobe that consists

and the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane region and tyrosine kinase domain. In the absence of ligand, the EGFR resides on the cell surface in an
inactive/autoinhibited conformation (left). Upon ligand (EGF) binding, the autoinhibitive conformation in the EGFR ectodomain is released,
leading to ectodomain-mediated receptor dimerization (right). In the cytoplasm, receptor dimerization results in formation of an asymmetric
kinase homodimer in which the C-terminal lobe of the “donor” kinase (colored pink) interacts with the N-terminal lobe of the acceptor/
activated kinase (colored green) to confer allosteric activation of the acceptor kinase. The juxtamembrane segment of the acceptor kinase in
turn associates with the C-terminal lobe of the donor kinase to stabilize this activating asymmetric dimer (right zoom).

The clinical use of EGFRtargeted agents in non-small
cell lung cancer

known; however, analysis of the crystal packing within
previous EGFR kinase domain crystal structures led to
the observation that in the active state the N-terminal lobe
of the EGFR kinase domain interacts with the C-terminal
lobe of a partner kinase domain [94]. Subsequent
studies have validated this tail-head, or donor-acceptor,
interaction and discovered that the donor, or tail, molecule
activates the acceptor, or head, molecule by inducing
an activating conformational movement centered on the
N-terminal lobe [95,96]. The result is that only one of the
kinase domains in an activated EGFR-family receptor
complex is in a catalytically competent state, a finding
that helps explain the mechanism of ErbB2 activation by
the catalytically inactive ErbB3 via heterodimerization.
Further studies have shown that the juxtamembrane region
(the segment connecting the transmembrane helix to the
kinase domain) of the active/acceptor EGFR stabilizes this
asymmetric dimer by interacting with the C-terminal lobe
of the donor kinase [16,97]. Acquired point mutations in
the juxtamembrane region seen in NSCLC (e.g. V689M,
L703F) further promote the asymmetric head-tail active
state [16], providing a clear rationale for activated EGFR
in these patients.

Initial studies
Over the last few years, we have seen a revolution
in the understanding of the appropriate use of EGFRtargeted therapy in non-small cell lung cancer. Initial
studies of both erlotinib and gefitinib demonstrated
good overall tolerability with skin rashes, diarrhea and
occasional episodes of pneumonitis noted as the main
concerns and modest activity of 10-20% response rates
were noted in unselected populations [101]. Significantly
higher responsiveness was noted in certain patient subsets,
such as patients with adenocarcinoma histology, women,
patients of Oriental descent and non-smoking patients.
Disappointingly, four large randomized studies combining
these drugs with upfront chemotherapy demonstrated
negative results while in the second/third-line setting an
overall survival benefit was noted in the pivotal BR.21
study of erlotinib versus best supportive care [102] but
not in the ISEL study comparing gefitinib with best
supportive care [103], although an overall survival benefit
in the Asian subset was observed. These studies ultimately
led to the approval of erlotinib in the U.S. and gefitinib in
many Asian countries for second-line or subsequent use.

Oncogenic EGFR mutations
Structural studies have also provided clues to the
mechanisms by which activating and resistance mutations
alter kinase activity and how small molecule inhibitors
can specifically target mutant enzyme [98]. The most
commonly seen activating point mutation in EGFR,
L858R, is incompatible with the inactive state of the kinase
[24,99], and the crystal structure of the L858R mutant
revealed that additional hydrogen bonds are formed which
serve to further stabilize the active state of the kinase
[99]. The mechanism by which this and other mutations
activate EGFR, however, is not completely explained by a
conformational predisposition to the active-state. Kinetic
analyses found that clinically relevant mutations in EGFR
alter binding to both ATP and inhibitors (e.g. erlotinib and
imatinib) in such a way that the ratio of Kd to Km[ATP] is
altered in favor of the inhibitors [98-100]. These measured
changes in apparent Ki therefore provide a mechanism for
selective inhibition of mutant EGFR by small molecules
such as erlotinib and imatinib [98]. Alterations in ATPdependent reaction rates and inhibitor binding affinities
are probably the mechanism for acquired resistance by
the T790M mutation [76]. Therapeutically, the use of
covalently binding inhibitors (e.g. HKI-272, BIBW2992,
PF00199804) may present a mechanism to overcome
resistance by binding in a similar fashion to non-covalent
inhibitors, but with covalent attachment to EGFR residue
cysteine-797 [82,98].

Search for predictive biomarkers
Alongside these key clinical studies, multiple
biomarkers were identified and tested, most notably
EGFR expression by immunohistochemistry, EGFR copy
number changes detected by FISH or quantitative PCR
and with the discovery of activating EGFR mutations
in highly responsive patients, EGFR mutational status
[104]. Lately, it has become quite clear that the best
predictor of a major clinical response is the presence
of activating EGFR mutations in the tumor, mainly
exon 19 deletions or L858R mutation. Indeed, at this
point it needs to be recognized that EGFR-mutant lung
adenocarcinoma is a distinct clinical entity and currently
upfront general testing for EGFR mutational status
is endorsed by many leading institutions, is available
through several commercial entities and with the use of
multiple platforms ranging from direct sequencing to high
sensitivity, mutation-specific detection techniques [105].
EGFR copy number changes also have some predictive
value but most of its value might lie in the fact that true
EGFR gene amplification typically closely correlates with
EGFR mutational status and thereby is a surrogate marker
for such. EGFR gene copy number increase (polysomy)
without EGFR gene amplification is much less robust of
504

a predictor. EGFR expression by immunohistochemistry
has not proven to be a clinically effective predictor of
responsiveness. Overall, lately there has been a dramatic
shift in clinical practice towards the isolated use of EGFR
mutational status when choosing EGFR-targeted therapy
based on numerous first-line clinical studies listed below.
Among other biomarkers, serum proteomics have also
been developed and in a number of studies have shown
correlation with clinical benefit from EGFR TKI therapy.
An approved test (VeriStrat) is available for clinical use
but given other available markers, its clinical utility
remains somewhat ill-defined [106]. K-RAS mutational
status repeatedly have been shown to be a negative
predictor of responsiveness and can be used as a “negative
surrogate” for EGFR mutational status since by and large
these mutations are exclusive of each other [65].

a PS of 0-2 [41]. Patients were randomized to receive
gefinitib versus carboplatium/paclitaxel for a maximum
of 6 cycles. Gefitinib demonstrated superiority in
terms of PFS for the ITT population with a HR of 0.74
(12-months PFS of 24.9 versus 6.7%), however the hazard
ratio was not constant over time. Further review showed
dramatic separation of outcomes based on EGFR mutant
status. In the EGFR-mutant group (59.7% of all patients
with available test result) the objective response rate of
71.2% and the PFS of 9.5 months in the gefitinib group
was much superior to an ORR of 47.3% and PFS of 6.3
months with chemotherapy compared to a sobering 1.1%
ORR and a 1.5 month PFS with gefitinib which was much
worse than results with standard chemotherapy (hazard
ratio of 2.85) in wild-type patients. The results of the
First-SIGNAL study comparing first-line cisplatinum/
gemcitabine with gefitinib in the first-line treatment of
309 Asian never-smokers with advanced adenocarcinoma
similarly showed improved 1-year PFS with gefitinib and
a response rate of 84.6 versus 37.5% in EGFR mutation
positive patients while extremely poor results were
noted with gefitinib in wild-type patients [109]. These
non-mutant selective studies demonstrated that clinical
factors are less predictive of responsiveness than tumor
genetics and provide very strong justification for upfront
testing if first-line EGFR therapy is contemplated since
clinically selected but EGFR WT patients appear to fare
dramatically worse on gefitinib than chemotherapy.
Recently, the results of studies exclusively
focusing on EGFR-mutated adenocarcinoma have also
been reported. The WJTOG3405 study enrolled 177
chemotherapy-naïve patients aged 75 years or younger and
diagnosed with stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer
or postoperative recurrence harboring EGFR mutationseither exon 19 deletions or L858R [110]. Patients were
randomly assigned to gefitinib or cisplatinum/docetaxel
for 3-6 cycles. The gefitinib group had significantly longer
progression-free survival compared to chemotherapy
(9.2 versus 6.3 months). Myelosuppression, alopecia,
fatigue were more common with chemotherapy, while
skin toxicity, liver dysfunction and diarrhea were more
frequent in the gefitinib group. Two patients in the
gefitinib group developed interstitial lung disease (2.3%).
The NEJ002 study [111] was prematurely closed after
accruing 230 patients due to a significant benefit seen
for gefitinib versus carboplatinum/paclitaxel in patients
with prospectively identified EGFR-mutated advanced
non-small cell lung cancer. Analysis of the first 200
patients showed a doubling of PFS by gefitinib (10.8
vs 5.4 months). Overall response rates were 74% with
gefitinib and 31% with chemotherapy. Median survival
was 30.5 months vs 23.6 months with gefitinib versus
chemotherapy, the OS difference was not statistically
significant. These results are almost superimposable with
each other and further demonstrate the excellent activity
of EGFR TKIs in this setting. Inoue and colleagues [112]

First-line use
Based on the poor overall outcome and significant
toxicity of upfront chemotherapy in advanced non-small
cell lung cancer, EGFR TKI therapy as front-line treatment
has significant appeal for the appropriate patient. Initial
studies focusing on leveraged patient populations based
on clinical predictors of higher EGFR TKI responsiveness
or selection by EGFR mutational status suggested
potentially excellent activity with response rates in the 5090% range in patients with tumors harboring activating
EGFR mutations. The American iTARGET trial focused
on a clinically enriched population of chemo-naïve
patients with non-squamous histology and demonstrated
a 55% RR, PFS of 9.2 months and OS of 17.5 months
in EGFR mutation positive patients [107]. The Spanish
study group reported the results of a prospective phase
II study about the use of erlotinib in advanced NSCLC
patients harbouring EGFR mutations. 2,105 patients
were screened and 350 (16.6%) identified to carry
EGFR mutations [42]. Median PFS and OS for the 217
patients who received erlotinib were 14 and 27 months,
patients with L858R had longer PFS than patients with
exon 19 deletions and outcomes did not seem to differ
whether erlotinib was given in the first or second-line
setting. A combined survival analysis (I-CAMP) of
seven prospective Japanese trials of 148 patients with
EGFR mutations who received gefitinib demonstrated a
response rate of 76.4%, median PFS of 9.7 months and
overall survival of 24.3 months [108]. Good performance
status and chemotherapy-naïve status were significantly
associated with a longer progression-free survival. On the
other hand, overall survival was not affected by first-line
or second-line gefitinib use suggestive of the benefit to be
sustained through several lines of therapy.
Recent, randomized clinical studies have brought
further clarity to this field. The IPASS study enrolled
1,217 chemotherapy-naïve patients with advanced lung
adenocarcinoma with no or light smoking history and

treated with gefitinib. Patients with EGFR mutations
had a higher response rate than wild-type patients (37.5
vs 2.6%). The INTEREST trial compared gefitinib with
docetaxel as second or third-line therapy in 1,466 patients
with advanced NSCLC treated with prior platinumbased chemotherapy [114]. Median OS was 7.6 months
in the gefitinib and 8.0 months in the docetaxel arm
demonstrating non-inferiority of gefitinib as compared to
docetaxel. Of note, EGFR mutation positive patients had
longer PFS and higher RR (42.1 vs 21.1%) and patients
with high EGFR copy number also had higher RR (13%
vs 7%) with gefitinib as compared with docetaxel. The
Korean ISTANA trial compared gefitinib with docetaxel
as second-line treatment in 161 patients with advanced
NSCLC and PFS HR (0.729), 6-months PFS (32 vs 13%)
and RR were found to be improved with gefitinib when
compared with docetaxel while OS was not different
[115].

completed a phase II trial of gefitinib in patients with poor
PS harboring EGFR mutations and a RR of 66%, PFS
of 6.5 and OS of 17.8 months were seen demonstrating
very impressive outcomes in a patient population with a
generally very poor survival redefining the boundaries of
when treatment might still be beneficial since patients with
a PS of >2 are generally not considered to be candidates
for chemotherapy.

Maintenance therapy
In the SATURN trial, 889 patients with advanced
non-small cell lung cancer and no evidence of disease
progression after 4 cycles of chemotherapy were
randomized to receive erlotinib versus placebo until
progression or unacceptable toxicity [113]. PFS (the
primary endpoint) was prolonged in the erlotinib group
(HR 0.71) and all biomarker groups showed a PFS benefit
with erlotinib. In particular, EGFR mutant patients saw
a marked improvement in PFS with erlotinib therapy
(HR 0.10). Median OS was also significantly improved
for the total population in the erlotinib group (HR 0.81).
The survival benefit was particularly large in patients
with adenocarcinoma histology and was not driven by
the EGFR-mutation positive subgroup, with a significant
improvement in survival observed in the EGFR wild-type
group ultimately leading to FDA-approval of erlotinib
in this indication. Notably, pemetrexed is also approved
as maintenance therapy in advanced non-squamous
non-small cell lung cancer and bevacizumab is also
utilized in the same setting until disease progression in
bevacizumab-eligible patients based on the survival
benefit seen in the ECOG4599 study confounding this
field. Erlotinib certainly appears to be an excellent choice
in the maintenance setting in patients with EGFR-mutated
tumors who have not received it as first-line therapy.

Maintenance beyond progression
Riely and colleagues [116] reported that a subset of
patients with non-small cell lung cancer who had acquired
resistance to EGFR TKIs and had discontinued treatment
progressed rapidly as shown by increased SUV in PET
scans at 3 weeks follow-up consistent with a diseaseflare associated with reduction of treatment pressure of a
known biological pathway. This has led to the unproven
practice of continuing EGFR TKI in primarily EGFR
TKI-sensitive patients at the time of disease progression.
This issue has significant implications for clinical practice
and at least one study is ongoing to answer the question of
whether this practice is beneficial or not (Table 1).

Locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer
With proven benefits of EGFR TKIs in the metastatic
setting, it would seem logical that such benefits would
extend to earlier stages of the illness. Nonetheless, the
SWOG0023 study surprisingly demonstrated inferior
outcomes with maintenance gefitinib versus placebo
following definitive chemoradiotherapy in patients
with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer [117].
Notably, these patients were not selected by biomarker
status. Few current studies focus on exploring EGFR TKI
therapy in this setting.

Second-line therapy
The pivotal BR.21 study which led to the approval
of erlotinib randomized 731 chemotherapy-refractory
patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer to
erlotinib or placebo in a 2:1 ratio and a response rate
of 8.9% was seen in the erlotinib group and an overall
survival benefit of 6.7 versus 4.7 months was noted [102].
ISEL was a randomized, placebo-controlled, international
multicenter phase III trial comparing gefitinib versus
BSC as second or third-line treatment for patients with
advanced NSCLC. 1,692 patients were enrolled in a
ratio of 2:1 to receive gefitinib 250 mg daily or placebo
plus BSC [103]. Differences in median survival did not
reach statistical significance while a higher response rate
and TTP was noted in the gefinitib arm. On preplanned
subgroup analyses, a longer survival time was seen for
never-smoker and Asian patients (9.5 vs 5.5 months)
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Adjuvant therapy
EGFR TKIs provide mostly palliative benefit in
the advanced setting similar to the benefit of Herceptin
in metastatic breast cancer. In patients with resected lung
cancer, the hope is that this class of drugs would on the
other hand improve cure rates and studies in this setting

are eagerly awaited. The RADIANT study is a phase
III study comparing erlotinib with placebo in resected
stage IB-IIIA NSCLC patients with EGFR IHC or FISHpositive tumors with the primary endpoint of improvement
in DFS. Efficacy data are eagerly awaited, it has been
reported that 12% of all samples carry EGFR mutations
and 19% K-Ras mutations [118]. A single-arm adjuvant
study focusing purely on EGFR-mutated tumors thereby
examining a more enriched population is also ongoing
(Table 1).

by overamplification of the MET oncogene rewiring
oncogenic pathways through overtaking activation of
the key coupler, ErbB3. Data also suggests that in some
tumors, MET-amplified tumor cells might preexist and
ultimately emerge as the predominant clone [83]. These
data might suggest that combination strategies of EGFR
and MET inhibition either at the outset to prevent or at
the time of progression to overcome resistance could be
promising and multiple clinical studies with a wide range
of MET-targeted agents are ongoing. At least one study
has demonstrated prolonged PFS with the combination
of erlotinib with the MET TKI, ARQ197 as compared to
erlotinib alone [123] and phase III studies in the EGFR
TKI-naïve setting are ongoing.

Acquired resistance
Irreversible EGFR inhibitors

Other strategies

The most common acquired resistance mechanism
is the emergence of EGFR-T790M, notable in about
50% of EGFR TKI-responsive patients at the time of
disease progression. Prevention or overcoming resistance
mediated by EGFR T790M is one of the most important
and challenging research tasks in this field [58]. While
in vitro multiple irreversible EGFR inhibitors have been
noted to retain at least partial efficacy against EGFR
T790M, initial experience with the irreversible dual
EGFR/ErbB2 TKI, neratinib (HKI-272) was disappointing
[119]. Another promising irreversible dual EGFR/ErbB2
inhibitor, BIBW2992 continues to generate interest.
Results of the phase II LUX-Lung-2 study focusing on
patients with EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer
have been reported and demonstrated a 61% response rate,
PFS of 14 months and median survival of 2 years [120].
Phase III studies of this compound in multiple settings,
including following failure of erlotinib or gefitinib are
ongoing. PF00299804, an irreversible HER1, 2 and 4
inhibitor has also shown preliminary anti-tumor activity
[121] and a predictable safety profile in a phase II study
in patients with NSCLC after failure of chemotherapy and
erlotinib. Several responses as well as prolonged stable
disease were reported in erlotinib-refractory patients
suggestive of potential clinical activity in this subset[122].
Further studies of this compound are also ongoing. One
major concern about these compounds is whether the
therapeutic window might be too narrow in this setting
and side effects as a result of WT EGFR or ErbB2
inhibition might be limiting. Recently, through a targeted
chemical screen selective inhibitors against T790M have
been reported [82] and there is certainly hope that such
rationally designed compounds might ultimately provide
sufficient selectivity.

Several preclinical reports showed that other agents,
such as the anti-EGFR monoclonal Ab cetuximab or
PI3K/mTOR inhibitors combined with irreversible EGFR
inhibitors hold promise to overcome resistance mediated
by T790M [124]. Heat shock protein inhibitors such a
geldanamycin or 17-DMAG are also thought to be a
potent strategy against T790M [79].

Novel biomarkers
Both primary and acquired resistance turn out to be
quite complex biologically and generate a tremendous
need for appropriate biomarkers both for treatment
selection as well as monitoring. Novel platforms for the
detection of circulating tumor cells and genetic changes in
these tumor cells seem the most promising to fill this void.
E.g. one study of CTCs from lung cancer patients was able
to identify EGFR T790M in CTCs of some patients and
progression-free survival was shorter as one might expect
in patients with than without T790M on erlotinib [125].
