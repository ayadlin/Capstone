BACKGROUND: Systemic high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) achieved long-term survival in a subset of patients with
advanced melanoma. The authors reported previously that intratumorally applied IL-2 induced complete local
responses of all metastases in >60% of patients. The objectives of the current study were to confirm those results in
a larger cohort and to identify patient or regimen characteristics associated with response. METHODS: Patients with
melanoma who had a median of 12 injectable metastases received intratumoral IL-2 treatments 3 times weekly until
they achieved clinical remission. The initial dose of 3 million international units was escalated, depending on the individual patient’s tolerance. RESULTS: Forty-eight of 51 patients were evaluable. Only grade 1/2 toxicity was recorded.
A complete response that lasted 6 months was documented in 70% of all injected metastases. A complete local
response of all treated metastases was achieved in 33 patients (69%), including 11 patients who had between 20 and
100 metastases. Response rates were higher for patients who had stage III disease compared with patients who had
stage IV disease. No objective responses of distant untreated metastases were observed. The 2-year survival rate was
77% for patients with stage IIIB/IIIC disease and 53% for patients with stage IV disease. Efficacy and survival did not
differ between patients who had 20 lesions and patients who had <20 lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Intratumoral IL-2
treatment elicited complete local responses in a high percentage of patients. Further studies will be required

Metastatic melanoma has an unfavorable prognosis, and treatment options are limited.1,2 In patients with stage III
melanoma, the objective of treating locoregional metastases is the complete removal of any detectable tumor manifestation. In patients who have many in-transit metastases, surgery often is no longer feasible. In a subset of patients who have
disease limited to 1 extremity, isolated limb perfusion can be applied but is associated with considerable toxicity.3 In
patients with stage IV melanoma and for patients who have unresectable metastases, palliative systemic treatments generally are preferred. However, surgical treatment is the first choice in stage IV if the patient can be rendered free of disease at
all known metastatic sites; and, in 10% to 20% of patients with stage IV disease, this therapeutic option seems to be associated with a clear survival benefit.4 Therefore, alternative direct treatment options are needed if disease is not completely
resectable.
Interleukin-2 (IL-2) has been used in immunotherapy against cancer since the early 1980s, applied either as a single agent5
or in combination with adoptively transferred, lymphokine-activated killer cells.6 Another approach is the adoptive transfer of
in vitro expanded, autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes7 followed by high-dose IL-2.8 A retrospective analysis of 8 trials
that used systemic high-dose IL-2 in patients with melanoma demonstrated response rates of 16%, including 6% complete
responses. Greater than 50% of the complete responders in those trials remained progression-free after 5 years.9 These data led
to US Food and Drug Administration approval of systemic high-dose IL-2 for the treatment of advanced melanoma in 1998.

Intratumoral application of drugs is an appealing
therapeutic concept, because high concentrations can be
achieved within the tumor, which may be essential to
attain the desired therapeutic effect. Furthermore, systemic concentrations of locally applied drugs are low in
contrast to systemic treatments with the same agent,
resulting in comparably low toxicity. Several cytokines
have been used for intratumoral therapy with various
results.10-12 The first report that described the regression
of melanoma metastases after intratumoral IL-2 treatment
was published in 1994.13 On the basis of those findings,
we initiated a pilot study on 24 patients and observed
complete responses of all treated metastases in >60%. In
contrast to systemic, high-dose therapy, intratumoral
application was associated with low toxicity.14 The objectives of the current study were to confirm our previous
results in a larger cohort and to identify relevant patient or
regimen characteristics associated with response to treatment and with overall survival.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
The study protocol (National Clinical Trials [NCT] clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00204581) was approved by
the local ethics committees, and patients were treated only
after written informed consent was obtained. Inclusion
criteria comprised age >18 years, histopathologically proven malignant melanoma, the presence of injectable dermal or subcutaneous metastases either in clinical stage III
or clinical stage IV, and an expected survival >3 months.
Excluded were pregnant or lactating women and patients
with severe cardiac disease (New York Heart Association
III and IV), alanine and aspartate aminotransferase levels
>3 times above the upper limit of normal, creatinine
>1.5 times above the upper limit of normal, and concomitant systemic therapy with steroids. Patients who
required systemic chemotherapeutic treatment for metastatic disease and patients who had locoregional lymph
node metastases were excluded. Previous systemic chemotherapy was allowed.
Study Design and Treatment
The trial had the design of an open, prospective phase 2
study. Patients were recruited at 2 study sites (Tuebingen
and Homburg, Germany). For preparation of IL-2, 18
million international units (MIU) of recombinant human
IL-2 (Proleukin; Novartis, New York, NY) were dissolved
in 6 mL glucose 5% supplemented with 0.2% human se-

rum albumin. IL-2 was injected intratumorally using 30gauge needles for superficial injections and 27-gauge needles for deep injections, and single doses ranged between
0.3 MIU and 6 MIU, depending on the lesion size. One
injection per lesion was applied for doses per lesion up to
3 MIU, and 2 injections were applied for doses >3 MIU
per lesion. Treatment was initiated at 3 MIU IL-2 daily,
and the dose was escalated by 1.5 MIU each treatment
day up to the desired total dose according to the number
of lesions and treatment guidelines (Table 1), provided
that tolerability was maintained. The total daily dose was
divided between all injectable lesions. For deep soft tissue
metastases, sonography was used to guide injections. Up
to 25 lesions were treated simultaneously; however, if more
lesions were present, then they were treated alternately or
subsequently. The treatment schedule was 3 times weekly on
an outpatient basis. Treatment was terminated when clinical
regression and/or necrosis of metastases was evident or if progression occurred that no longer was manageable by ongoing
IL-2 injections. Adverse events were graded according to the
Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3).
Response Evaluation
Every treated metastasis was evaluated separately regarding clinical response between 4 weeks and 8 weeks after
stopping IL-2 treatment and every 3 months thereafter.
The following definitions were used: a complete response
(CR) of a treated lesion was defined as the disappearance
of any evidence of vital tumor and lack of tumor growth
after stopping injections over a period of at least 6 months.
A partial response (PR) was defined as a decrease 30%
in the greatest dimension (longest diameter [LD]). Stable
disease (SD) was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to

qualify for a PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as progressive disease (PD). PD was defined as an increase
20% increase in the LD of the lesion. Subcutaneous metastases were evaluated by sonography. In nondistinctive
cases (eg, if there was residual pigmentation), biopsies
were taken for histopathologic confirmation of response.

Analysis of Specific Cellular Immune
Responses
For 1 patient, the frequency of antimelanoma T cells was
measured by flow cytometric analysis at different time
points. Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) were incubated for 11 days in X-Vivo 15 (Lonza
Verviers, Braine-l’Alleud, Belgium) with mixtures of overlapping peptides (PepMix; JPT Technologies, Berlin,
Germany) that spanned the whole sequence of Melan-A,
cancer-testis antigen (NY-ESO1), melanoma-associated
antigen 3 (MAGE-A3), Survivin, and membrane protein
M1/nucleocapsid protein from influenza virus, each at a
concentration of 1 lg/mL. On Day 4, IL-2 was added
(40 U/mL; Chiron Behring GmbH, Marburg, Germany).
On Day 11, autologous PBMCs as stimulator cells were
labeled with 5 lM carboxy fluorescein succinyl ester
(CFSE) (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and incubated
for 6 hours with each peptide mixture mentioned above.
Cultured T cells were harvested and incubated at a 1:2
ratio with unpulsed or peptide-pulsed stimulator cells in
the presence of 1 lL/mL Golgi-Plug (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) for 12 hours. Thereafter, the
cells were incubated with ethidium monoazide (EMA)
(Invitrogen) followed by fixation and permeabilization
with CytoFix/CytoPerm (BD Biosciences) and staining
with cluster of differentiation (CD) 3 antibody (antiCD3)-Pacific Orange (Caltag; Invitrogen), anti-CD4-peridinin chlorophyll protein complex, and anti-CD8-allophycocyanin-indocyanine 7 (BD Biosciences). Intracellular
IFN-c staining was done with a phycoerythrin/indocyanine

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using the SPSS 15.0
software package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill). Follow-up was
defined as the time from the first IL-2 injection to the
date of last contact or death. For survival analyses, only
deaths that were caused by melanoma were considered.
The last survival update was done for all patients in April
2009. Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to estimate
overall survival. Differences in response rates were calculated by using a 2-tailed Fisher exact test.

using a BD LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Flow
cytometric data analysis was performed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, San Carlos, Calif) after the exclusion of
CFSE-positive stimulator cells and EMA-positive dead
cells. IFN-c secretion was considered antigen-specific only
when the frequency of IFN-positive T cells that responded
to peptide-pulsed PBMCs was at least 2 times greater than
the frequency of IFN secretion in response to the negative
control (unpulsed PBMCs).

RESULTS
Patients and Treatments
In total, 51 patients (44 in Tuebingen and 7 in Homburg)
were enrolled between August 2003 and November 2007
and completed IL-2 treatment by December 2007. Two
patients were excluded after they provided informed consent, because progressive visceral disease that was detected
at baseline staging diagnostics required chemotherapy.
For 1 patient, neither treatment nor follow-up data were
available. The baseline data from the 48 remaining
patients are summarized in Table 2. The median patient

age was 69 years (range, 37-88 years). Thirty-three
patients were treated in stage III, and 15 patients were
treated in stage IV. Among the patients with stage IV disease, 5 patients had lymph node/visceral metastases that
were not accessible to local IL-2 treatment. Among the
patients with stage III disease and the remaining 10
patients with stage IV disease, all metastases were accessible for injections. Most patients had received previous
extensive therapy. Twenty-eight patients developed
locoregional recurrences after undergoing surgery for metastatic disease. The last surgery occurred 8 weeks before
the start of IL-2 therapy for 14 of 28 patients, and 22
of 28 patients underwent 2 previous surgeries. In 5
patients, limb perfusion or radiotherapy also was performed. Previous systemic treatments with interferon
alpha (IFN-a) (11 patients), chemotherapy (8 patients),
or both modalities subsequently (3 patients) had been
applied before IL-2 treatment was initiated. The median
duration of IL-2 treatment was 6 weeks (range, 1-32
weeks; some patients received several subsequent treatments for newly developing metastases), and the applied
median total dose was 68.5 MIU IL-2 (range, 13.5-548.1
MIU). The median number of metastases treated per
patient was 12. The highest daily dose was 16 MIU IL-2.
Toxicity
All 48 patients were included in the analysis of toxicity.
The treatment generally was tolerated well, and only grade
1 and 2 toxicity was recorded. Intratumoral IL-2 therapy
almost always caused an inflammatory injection site reaction (local swelling and erythema) followed by a selective
necrosis of the tumor tissue that generally did not affect
the surrounding normal tissue. Injection pain also was fre-

quent but was manageable by the application of a local
anesthetic cream and oral metamizole. The majority of
patients experienced fever (58%) that could be controlled
easily by acetaminophen. Fatigue (36%) and nausea
(34%) usually were mild and of short duration. Frequent
adverse events are presented in Figure 1. Adverse events
that were observed in <10% of patients but that were at
least possibly related to the treatment included stomach
pain, myalgia, and headache (in 4 patients each); itching
exanthema (in 3 patients); dry oral mucosa (in 2 patients);
pruritus (in 2 patients); hair loss (in 1 patient); and diarrhea (in 1 patient). One patient presented with generalized urticaria, which was abated by antihistaminic
treatment and did not recur after further IL-2 treatments
under continued prophylactic medication. One patient
observed worsening of a pre-existing atopic dermatitis,
and 1 patient reported a single episode of mild cardiac
arrythmia. One patient presented with vitiligo-like depigmentation around the treated metastases (Fig. 2).

The calculation of differences between 2 groups of patients was based on the CR rate.

Clinical Responses to IL-2 Treatment
In total, 894 of 917 separately treated metastases (97.5%)
could be evaluated for local tumor response (Table 3).
The analysis revealed a 78.7% CR rate, a 0.7% PR rate,
16.3% stable metastases, and 4.3% progressive lesions.
Differences regarding the rate of complete local responses
of injected metastases were detected between stage III versus stage IV (96.9% vs 54.8%, respectively; P < .0001)
and the absence or presence of visceral metastases (92.5%
vs 16.5%, respectively; P < .0001). Furthermore, efficacy
differed significantly between dermal versus subcutaneous
injected lesions both for stage III disease (CR rate: 97.9%
vs 90.3%, respectively; P ¼ .0034) and stage IV disease
(CR rate: 56.7% vs 34.4%, respectively; P ¼ .0247). No
objective responses of noninjected distant lesions were
observed in 5 patients with stage IV disease who had visceral metastases. Figure 3 illustrates the clinical course of
3 patients who received intratumoral IL-2 treatment.
In 33 patients (69%) a complete local response of all
treated metastases was achieved with a better outcome for
patients who had stage III disease compared with patients
who had stage IV disease (82% vs 40%; P ¼ .0067). Of
these, 32 patients were completely free of recognizable tumor after treatment. The percentage of patients with a
complete local response of all treated metastases did not
depend on the number of treated lesions (73% for
patients who had 20 treated metastases vs 66% for
patients who had <20 treated metastases; P ¼ .7458).
Overall Survival
The median follow-up was 25 months from the start of
IL-2 treatment (range, 4-68 months; median, 14 months
for patients who died of their disease and 32.5 months for
all others). Overall survival rates were promising for all

CD8-positive T cells remained present even 2 months after the end of treatment; whereas the frequency of influenza-specific, IFN-c–positive T cells remained constant at
all 3 time points (data not shown). Similarly, there was a
marked increase (almost 2 times greater than background)
in the frequency of IFN-c–positive, CD4-positive T cells
that were specific for MAGE-A3 during and after therapy,
but the frequency of CD4-positive T cells that were specific for other antigens did not change significantly (Fig.

disease without visceral metastases was comparable to that
for patients who had stage III disease (Fig. 4A, dotted line).
The long-term outcome did not depend on the number of
treated metastases, because the overall survival for 15
patients who had 20 metastases was as good as that for
the other 33 patients who had <20 metastases (Fig. 4B).
Specific Cellular Immune Responses
For 1 additional patient with stage III disease who was
treated in 2008, peripheral blood samples were collected
before IL-2 injections, 4 weeks after starting treatment,
and 2 months after ending treatment. This woman had 19
dermal metastases, received 11 treatments (cumulative
dose 55 MIU IL-2), and had an ongoing complete clinical
and histopathologic response after therapy. There was a

DISCUSSION
Confirming the results from our pilot study in the current, larger trial, we again observed a complete local
response of all treated metastases in 69% of patients (82%
of patients with stage III disease and 40% of patients with
stage IV disease). It is well established that systemic, highdose IL-2 treatment is effective in a subset of patients with
melanoma, and this subgroup appears to represent most
patients who have soft tissue metastases. Phan et al
reported a 53% response rate to systemic IL-2 treatment
in a subgroup of 28 patients with subcutaneous and dermal metastases.15 Thus, the observed efficacy in our current trial most likely was a result of the high intratumoral
IL-2 concentration, which also has been described in animal models after intratumoral treatment.16
In contrast to systemic IL-2 treatment accompanied by
severe toxicity, intratumoral IL-2 treatment is well tolerated.
The good tolerability of this treatment obviously depends on
the small amounts applied, with little systemic leakage, and
on the application of treatment only 3 times weekly. This is
reflected in the complete lack of any premature terminations
of treatment because of toxicity in our study.
In the current study, we also tried to identify the
patient characteristics that were associated with outcome.
We observed that the presence of visceral metastases that
could not be injected also was associated with a low local
response rate of the injected metastases (CR, 16.7% of metastases; PR, 1.2% of metastases). This is an interesting observation and raises the issue of differences in the immune
responsiveness of patients who have visceral metastases.
These patients probably should be regarded as ineligible for
this treatment. Efficacy also was greater for dermal metastases than for subcutaneous metastases in both stage III and

stage IV disease. The greater size of subcutaneous lesions
may help explain this finding, because we generally observed
greater treatment efficacy in smaller metastases. Conversely,
injections into subcutaneous metastases usually were applied
after ultrasound-guided marking of the localization on the
skin surface. This occasionally may have led to peritumoral
injections instead of intratumoral injections, which are
known to be less effective.17 Another possible explanation
may be that the dermis provides a better environment for
inflammatory reactions than subcutaneous tissues.
The 2-year overall survival probability for patients
who had stage IIIB/IIIC disease was 77% (stage IIIB,
94%; stage IIIC, 61%), and it was 53% for patients who
had stage IV disease after starting local IL-2. It is noteworthy that the presence of a large number of metastases was
not associated with a poorer long-term outcome than the
presence of fewer metastases. In the current study, we
treated 13 patients who had 20 metastases but no
visceral lesions. Remarkably, 11 or those patients have
remained free of any residual tumor after stopping IL-2
treatment despite the initially high number of lesions.
Seven patients have remained free of any recurrence over
the follow-up period, and only 3 patients have died from
melanoma to date (data not shown). This subgroup of

Cancer

patients often is regarded as unresectable because of the
high number of metastases. Therefore, systemic chemotherapy (with response rates <30% and without any proven benefit on overall survival) otherwise generally would
be the only alternative treatment option for such patients.2
The exact mode of action of IL-2 is unknown. One
hypothesis is that lymphokine-activated killer cells are
induced by IL-2 and subsequently destroy the tumor by
direct lysis.6 Indeed, histopathologic evaluation of biopsies taken from IL-2–treated metastases revealed a dense
intratumoral and peritumoral lymphocytic infiltrate. We
observed that tumor cells were undergoing apoptosis and
that the mononuclear infiltrate mainly consisted of CD8positive, CD4-positive T cells, and (only to a minor
extent) natural killer cells.14 The favorable long-term outcomes that we observed suggest a possible beneficial systemic mode of action induced by the local treatment.
Systemic responses after locally applied intratumoral IL-2
have been described to date in various animal models.
Maas et al treated lymphoma-bearing mice and reported
the regression of distant uninjected lesions after intratumoral treatment. The same IL-2 doses given systemically
were far less effective.18 Van Es et al studied a transplanted rabbit carcinoma model and demonstrated that

4145

Original Article

peritumoral IL-2 induced complete regressions of
untreated contralateral tumors. A second challenge of
the cured animals resulted in tumor rejection, suggesting
the generation of specific immunity.19 In accordance with
these preclinical observations, we demonstrated vitiligo-like
depigmentation in 1 patient as a sign for the induction of a
specific immune response directed against differentiation
antigens. In another patient, a marked increase in circulating
antimelanoma T cells was observed, hinting at a possible systemic vaccination effect.20 The presented trial was planned
as a local treatment option for unresectable patients that did
not take into account possible systemic modes of action. We
only performed specific immune monitoring in 1 patient.
Therefore, the significance of these data are limited, and
additional patients need to be analyzed in subsequent trials.
We are aware that the design of the current study does not
allow us to reach any definite conclusions regarding longterm outcome, because the trial did not include a control
group and may have been influenced by a positive selection
bias. Moreover, a potential positive systemic effect of locally
applied IL-2 is questionable because of the inability of the
treatment to induce regression of distant metastases that
were not treated directly in 5 of our patients. Nevertheless,
our observations strongly support further pursuit of this
therapeutic approach in a randomized trial that includes a
control (surgery-alone) group.
In conclusion, intratumoral IL-2 treatment elicited complete local responses of all injected lesions in
69% of patients, especially in patients without visceral
metastases. A high proportion of patients could be
rendered completely free of injected metastases using
this approach. A large number of metastases was not
associated with a poorer long-term outcome. Therefore, intratumoral IL-2 may be regarded as a promising therapeutic option for a selected subgroup of
patients with melanoma and also may be feasible for
the treatment of other accessible solid tumor entities.
Further studies will be required to investigate the
mode of action and the impact on survival of intratumoral treatment with IL-2.
