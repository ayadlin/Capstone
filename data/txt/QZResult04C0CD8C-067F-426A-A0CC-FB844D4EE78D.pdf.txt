Abstract
Late-stage clear cell renal carcinoma poses a formidable
clinical challenge due to the high mortality rate associated
with this disease. Molecular and genetic studies have
identified functional loss of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene
as a frequent and crucial event in the development of the
malignant phenotype of clear cell renal carcinomas. Loss of
VHL function thus represents a pathognomonic molecular
defect for therapeutic exploitation. The objective of this study
was to evaluate the possibility of targeting VHL loss through
pharmacologic means. Chromomycin A3 (ChA3) was identified
through in silico analysis of existing publicly available drug
profiles from the National Cancer Institute as an agent that
seemed to selectively target VHL-deficient clear cell renal
carcinoma cells. Genotype-selective toxicity was first determined through short-term viability assays and then confirmed
with clonogenic studies. Coculture of fluorescently labeled
VHL-deficient and VHL-positive cells showed discriminate
killing of the VHL-deficient cells with ChA3. Mechanistically,
overexpression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-2A in VHLpositive clear cell renal carcinoma cells phenocopied loss of
VHL with respect to ChA3 toxicity, establishing ChA3 as a
HIF-dependent cytotoxin. This study shows the feasibility of
selectively targeting the loss of the VHL tumor suppressor
gene in clear cell renal carcinoma for potential clinical benefit
and may have greater ramifications in the development of
new targeted therapies for the treatment of cancer and other
genetic diseases. [Cancer Res 2007;67(12):5896–905]

Introduction
An estimated 51,190 people in the United States will be
diagnosed with cancer of the kidney or renal pelvis in the year
2007. An estimated 12,890 people in the United States will die due
to cancer of the kidney or renal pelvis in 2007 (1). For those
presenting with locally confined stage I and II disease, surgical
resection is sufficient for cure in >90% of patients. Unfortunately,
f25% of patients present with distant metastases or significant
local-regional disease as symptoms arise only late in the course of
disease. As with other tumor types, extension of tumor cells beyond
the organ of origin into the surrounding tissue, lymph nodes,
and distant metastasis poses a considerable clinical challenge.
Individuals with stage IV disease have a median survival of
10 months and a 5-year survival rate of 10%. Systemic therapies
are severely limited, as renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is notoriously

refractory to standard treatment regimens, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Immunotherapy currently fills the
gap with only moderate success. Complete and durable responses
have been observed in select patients with this modality.
Many key insights into the understanding of RCC have developed
over the last few years, much of which can be credited to the study
of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. An autosomal-dominant,
hereditary tumor syndrome, VHL disease is characterized by a
narrow spectrum of tumors, which include clear cell RCC
(CC-RCC), pheochromocytomas, and hemangioblastomas of the
central nervous system and retina. Genetic studies of VHL disease
led to the identification and cloning of the VHL gene. Tumor
formation in VHL disease follows the Knudson two-hit model,
whereby a defective copy of the VHL gene is inherited, whereas
somatic inactivation occurs in the remaining allele, leading to
malignancy. CC-RCC is a prominent feature in hereditary VHL
disease, suggesting an etiologic role of the VHL gene in sporadic
CC-RCC. Gnarra et al. (2) found that VHL is mutated in 57% of
CC-RCC. An additional 10% to 20% of cases are due to inactivation
of the VHL gene through hypermethylation (3). Thus, loss of VHL
function occurs in a significant fraction of sporadic CC-RCC,
approaching 70% to 80% of all cases.
The strong association of VHL inactivation in sporadic and
hereditary CC-RCC indicates a causative role for the loss of VHL in
the molecular pathogenesis of CC-RCC. Tumor suppression by VHL
was first established through tumor xenograft studies. Reintroduction of wild-type VHL into VHL-deficient CC-RCC cells inhibited
the ability of these cells to form tumors in nude mice (4). Elegant
molecular studies determined that VHL functions as an E3
ubiquitin, targeting hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-a for oxygendependent proteolysis (5). These studies suggest a role for HIF in
the development of CC-RCC that is supported by molecular
analyses of VHL disease-derived mutations. VHL patients with
specific mutations resulting in HIF dysregulation are at the greatest
risk for developing CC-RCC (6). Xenograft studies further support
the role of unregulated HIF activity in the CC-RCC as shown that
overexpression of a constitutively stable HIF-2a mutant phenocopies the loss of VHL, resulting in tumor growth (7).
Our improved understanding of the underlying molecular
defects and deficits in CC-RCC provides a tremendous opportunity
for the rational design of therapeutics to target this tumor type. A
70% probability of VHL functional loss in nonhereditary CC-RCC
and the subsequent normoxic hyperactivity of HIF transcription
factors lends itself to two possible therapeutic approaches:
restoration of VHL tumor suppressor function through HIF
inhibition or VHL inactivation-dependent cytotoxicity. The literature has overwhelmingly focused on the identification and characterization of agents that inhibit the HIF family of transcription
factors due to the applicability of HIF inhibitors to all solid tumors.
We confined our study to a single tumor type with a specific

Targeting VHL Loss

genetic lesion. Our strategy is tumor-selective cytotoxicity in CCRCC through VHL functional loss, a strategy applicable to an
estimated 70% of all new diagnoses of clear cell disease. In this
study, we identify a group of agents that selectively kill cells with
VHL defects, providing further validation to the concept of
targeting the loss of tumor suppressor genes.

Materials and Methods
COMPARE analysis. The NCI60 cell lines were categorized into either
VHL low expressers or VHL high expressers as described previously (8).
Briefly, VHL expression was determined from previously reported publicly
available microarray data (9). Based on these data, the NCI60 cell lines were
divided into three categories: VHL low expressers, mid expressers, and high
expressers. These categories were then used to design a seed pattern to
reflect the toxicity profile of a drug that targets VHL-deficient cells. This
seed pattern was then used in the COMPARE algorithm web located on the
Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) Web site1 to identify candidate
agents.
Cell culture and treatments. RCC4 and 786-O cells and their
derivatives, including the VHL-matched counterparts RCC4/VHL and
786/VHL, were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. For 2,3bis[2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide inner
salt (XTT) assays, 5,000 cells were plated in each well of a 96-well plate.
The cells were allowed to attach overnight. The following day, vehicle or
drug was added to each well. Four days later, regular DMEM culture
medium was aspirated and replaced with phenol red–free medium with
0.3 mg/mL XTT and 2.65 Ag/mL N-methyl dibenzopyrazine methyl sulfate.
The 96-well plates were returned to the 37jC incubator for 1 to 2 h. Metabolism of XTT was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 450 nm.
IC50s for each of the drugs were calculated using linear interpolation and
listed in figure legends.
Drugs. Pyrazoloacridine (NSC 366140), chromomycin A3 (ChA3; NSC
58514), echinomycin (NSC 526417), and batracylin (NSC 320846) were kindly
provided by the DTP of the National Cancer Institute (NCI)/NIH. Topotecan
was obtained from LKT Laboratories.
Colony survival assay. Cells were plated at 300, 3,000, and 30,000 cells
per dish in 60-mm tissue culture dishes. The cells were allowed to attach
overnight. The following day, vehicle or drug was added to the dishes and
cells were incubated in the presence of drug for 10 to 14 days. At the
conclusion of the incubation period, colonies were identified with crystal
violet stain, 95% ethanol, and 0.1% crystal violet and quantitated. All
conditions were measured in triplicate and each experiment was done in
duplicate or triplicate.
Plasmids and retroviral infections. The CMV-EYFP fluorescent
protein, CMV-ECFP fluorescent protein, and the HIF-2a P531A/N847A
double mutant were cloned into the pBabe-puro vector. Transfection of the
pBabe-puro plasmid into fNX-amphotropic retrovirus-producing cell line
was done according to the manufacturer’s instructions with LipofectAMINE
Plus (Invitrogen). Retrovirus was harvested beginning 48 h after transfection
at 32jC for 3 days. Retrovirus was added to target cells each day for a total
of 3 days. Puromycin treatment at 2 Ag/mL was used to select cell lines with
stable integration of the retroviral element. Individual clones of the HIF2
P531A/N847A containing RCC4/VHL cells were isolated.
Immunoblotting. Cells were lysed in urea lysis buffer [9 mol/L urea,
75 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L h-mercaptoethanol]. Cells were
sonicated briefly (10 s). Fifty to 100 micrograms of protein (as determined
by Bradford assay, Bio-Rad) were resolved on 8% or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes.
Total HIF-1a protein was detected with anti-HIF-1a antibody from
Transduction Laboratories (clone 54) and HIF-2a with a mouse monoclonal
antibody (clone ep190b) from Novus Biologicals. Anti-a-tubulin was from

Research Diagnostics, Inc. (clone DM1A). Anti-VHL was from BD
PharMingen (clone Ig32).
In vivo experiments. Male nude mice, 4 to 6 weeks old, were obtained
from Charles River Laboratories. 786-O and 786/VHL cells were counted
and resuspended in sterile PBS. Five million cells were injected into each
flank of the animal (786-O cells in one flank and 786/VHL cells in the
opposite flank). The extensive collection of data about in vivo treatment
with ChA3 (NSC 58514) was reviewed on the DTP Web site. The in vivo data
were used as a guide for the dosage and scheduling of our treatments.
Based on these studies, we completed a small-scale testing of tolerated dose
(data not shown). We found that i.p. injection of 2 and 2.5 mg/kg led to
mortality within 3 days of injection. We chose a treatment schedule of
0.4 and 0.6 mg/kg i.p. injection every 3 days based on our findings, in
addition to the data from the DTP Web site. Tumor-bearing mice (tumor
size, f200 mm3) were randomized into either vehicle control group or the
ChA3 treatment group. Mice were injected i.p. every 3 days for a total of
five times with PBS, ChA3 in PBS at 0.4 mg/kg, or ChA3 in PBS at 0.6 mg/kg.

Results
COMPARE algorithm identifies drugs based on VHL
expression patterns in NCI60 panel. A tissue-directed anticancer
drug screen was created in 1990 by the NCI to evaluate compounds
for antineoplastic activity. A cell line panel consisting of 60 tumor
cell lines from nine different tissue types deemed the NCI60 was
established. Importantly, these 60 cell lines span a spectrum of
molecular defects, allowing for the analysis of drug activity with
respect to specific molecular alterations. To examine the relationship between VHL expression and drug sensitivity, we divided the
60 cell lines into three categories based on VHL expression, VHL
low expressers (n = 16), VHL mid expressers (n = 35), and VHL high
expressers (n = 9), as measured by microarray analysis and
described previously (8, 9). These VHL expression categories were
then used to construct a theoretical drug activity pattern, or seed
pattern, reflective of a drug that targets VHL-deficient cells or,
more specifically, VHL low expressers (Fig. 1A). In the design of the
seed pattern, cells designated low expressers were set to be the
most sensitive to the theoretical drug, whereas the high expressers
were set to be the least sensitive to the drug. All remaining cell lines
were placed into the mid expressers category and given a neutral
sensitivity to the theoretical drug. A schematic of the theoretical
seed pattern is shown in Fig. 1A. The X axis represents VHL
expression, whereas the Y axis represents drug sensitivity.
The COMPARE algorithm (10), a pattern recognition algorithm,
was then used to evaluate the seed pattern individually against
each of the drugs in the Standard Agent Database of the DTP at the
NCI (11). The COMPARE algorithm returned a rank-ordered list
of compounds most similar to our seed pattern based on the
concentration of drug at which growth is inhibited by 50% (GI50)
and the Pearson correlation coefficient. The top 10 rank-ordered
compounds returned by the COMPARE algorithm are shown in
Fig. 1B. Included in the table are the NSC identifier, the common
name, the average GI50 of the VHL low expressers, and the average
GI50 of the high expressers as well as a P value from a t test
comparing the GI50s between the two categories.
All 60 cell lines were used in the COMPARE analysis. Due to the
large size of the mid-expresser group, 35 cell lines, which were all
set to a neutral sensitivity, the analysis was biased toward
identifying drugs with a relatively flat GI50 distribution. COMPARE
analysis results were thus further scrutinized by examining the
average GI50s in the VHL low expressers versus the VHL high
expressers. Ideally, we hypothesized we would identify drugs with a
high potency (large negative log GI50) and significant difference

between the low and high expressers (low P value). Despite having
a statistically significant difference in the GI50 between VHL high
and low expressers, nitroestrone (NSC 321803) is a low-potency
agent with log GI50s of 3.12 mol/L and 3.32 mol/L, respectively.
Thus, it was not considered for further study. ChA3 (NSC 58514)
is a highly potent agent with a log GI50 of 11.24 mol/L and
10.78 mol/L in the low and high VHL expressers, respectively.
Based on these results, we tested the top four compounds for
activity against VHL-deficient cells. This analysis provided a rapid
and inexpensive means of identifying compounds potentially
capable of targeting VHL-deficient tumors.
The top four compounds identified by COMPARE analysis were
evaluated in a short-term viability assay in two well-characterized
CC-RCC cell lines (Fig. 1C). We measured metabolic activity, a
surrogate marker of viability, by the capacity of the cells to convert
the tetrazolium salt XTT to a colored formazan (Fig. 1C).
Pyrazoloacridine and batracylin led to an equivalent reduction in

XTT metabolism between the VHL-deficient cells (RCC4 and
786-O) and the VHL-positive cells (RCC4/VHL and 786/VHL) at
each of the concentrations examined, indicating that these two
drugs are equitoxic regardless of VHL status. In contrast, ChA3 and
echinomycin showed a selective reduction in XTT metabolism in
the VHL-deficient cell lines relative to the VHL-positive cell lines,
suggesting that these two drugs induce a decrease in cellular
proliferation and/or an increase in cell death through a mechanism
dependent on the loss of VHL.
ChA3 targets VHL-deficient cells. A short-term analysis of
candidate drug toxicity versus VHL expression status in CC-RCC
cells with the XTT viability screen revealed that pyrazoloacridine
and batracylin are equitoxic regardless of VHL status, whereas
ChA3 and echinomycin are significantly more toxic to VHLdeficient cells. However, clonogenic survival assays are the classic
means of determining the efficacy of a candidate agent on cell
growth. ChA3 toxicity was examined in RCC4 and 786-O CC-RCC

Targeting VHL Loss

Figure 2. ChA3 targets VHL-deficient cells. A, clonogenic assay of 786-O and
786/VHL cells. Cells (300, 3000, and 30,000) were plated in triplicate in 6-cm
dishes. The following day, ChA3 was added. At the conclusion of a 9- to 11-d
incubation period, the colonies were stained with crystal violet and counted.
The average of the three plates is graphed as percentage survival relative to the
untreated plates. Bars, SE. Photograph of plates with 3,000 cells treated with
ChA3 (786-O, 12.5 ng/mL and RCC4, 25 ng/mL) is included in the right-hand
corner of each graph. B, clonogenic assay of RCC4 and RCC4/VHL cells
done as described above except with incubation period of 12 to 14 d.
C, ECFP-labeled RCC4 cells and EYFP-labeled RCC4/VHL cells were mixed at

the cells were rinsed with PBS and refed with normal medium. Four days later,

cell lines and their VHL-positive counterparts with clonogenic
survival assays (Fig. 2A and B). Both 786-O and RCC4 cell lines
deficient in VHL were more sensitive to ChA3, whereas the VHLpositive matched counterparts were only sensitive at much higher
drug concentrations. These results are consistent with the XTT
assays and indicate that ChA3 is a genotype-selective agent
targeting cells deficient in VHL activity.

As tumors originate from a single transformed cell in the midst
of a population normal untransformed tissue, effective genotypeselective antitumor agents should then be able to discriminately
eradicate transformed tissue that coexists side by side with normal
tissue. We used coculture experiments of RCC4 cells, representative
of transformed cells, and RCC4/VHL cells, representative of
untransformed tissue, to simulate the tumor microenvironment
where cancerous tissue is intermingled with normal tissue.
Genetically, these cells differ only with respect to VHL expression
and experiments have shown no effect of VHL expression on
in vitro proliferation rates (4). This coculture model was used to
determine if ChA3 could discriminate between the VHL-deficient
renal carcinoma tumor cell and the VHL-positive cell. Enhanced
cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) fluorescently labeled RCC4 cells
and enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) fluorescently
labeled RCC4/VHL cells were mixed in equal proportions. This
mixed population of cells was then treated with vehicle or
increasing concentrations of ChA3 for 4 h. At the conclusion of
the treatment, the cells were rinsed with PBS and refed with fresh
medium and allowed to grow for an additional 4 days. Figure 2C
shows that ChA3 results in a dose-dependent selective loss of the
ECFP-labeled VHL-deficient RCC4 cells, whereas the EYFP-labeled
RCC4/VHL cells continued to proliferate, critically showing the
concept of targeting tumors based on VHL status. More
importantly, this serves as proof to the larger idea of genotypeselective toxicity based on loss of function of tumor suppressor
gene function.
VHL mutants are more sensitive to ChA3. Complete
disruption of VHL function sensitizes cells to ChA3-induced
toxicity as shown by clonogenic survival studies and mixing
experiments of VHL-deficient and VHL-positive cell lines. As HIF-a
subunit stabilization is the best-characterized consequence of VHL
disruption, we hypothesized that a compromise in the ability of
VHL to mediate HIF-a subunit degradation enhances ChA3
toxicity. Several clinically derived mutations found in VHL disease
have been studied for their ability to bind and ubiquitylate HIF-a
subunits, including the Y98H and Y112H mutations (6, 12). We
examined these two VHL mutations for their ability to modify
sensitivity to ChA3. These mutations are clinically derived from
patients with type 2A VHL disease and have been shown to retain
the ability to suppress normoxic stabilization of the HIF-a subunit
in vivo, although with diminished activity relative to wild-type VHL
(6). To evaluate the role of the diminished ability of VHL mutants
to degrade the HIF-a subunit as a mechanism of enhancing the
toxic effects of ChA3, we studied the toxicity of ChA3 in RCC4 cells
stably transfected with VHL Y98H and VHL Y112H, RCC4/VHL
Y98H, and RCC4/VHL Y112H (Fig. 3A). Consistent with previous
results, the RCC4 cells were more sensitive than the RCC4/VHL
cells. Both RCC4 cell lines stably expressing the type 2A VHL
mutants showed increased sensitivity relative to the wild-type
RCC4/VHL cell line, although not to the extent of the VHLdeficient RCC4 cell line (Fig. 3A).
Western blot analysis was used to examine the ability of the
VHL mutants Y98H and Y112H to regulate HIF-a subunits relative
to wild-type VHL function (Fig. 3B). HIF-1a and HIF-2a protein
levels were evaluated with immunoblot detection in each of the
cell lines. We observed high levels of both HIF-1a and HIF-2a in
the native RCC4 cells and low levels in the wild-type RCC4/VHL
cells. The Y98H VHL mutation suppressed normoxic HIF-1a
stabilization, although not to the extent of wild-type VHL, and the
Y112H mutation had no apparent suppressive effect on HIF-1a.

Both of the VHL mutants had less detectable HIF-2a protein
than the RCC4 cells, indicating that both of these mutants
retain the partial ability to regulate HIF-2a in vivo. The Y98H
mutant suppressed normoxic stabilization of the HIF-2a subunit
to lower levels than the Y112H VHL mutant. Correspondingly,
lower levels of Glut1 protein, a HIF target, were observed in the
Y98H mutant relative to the Y112H mutant. Immunoblots were
also done for VHL protein, and a-tubulin served as a loading
control.
Y112H VHL mutant cells are more sensitive to ChA3 than the
Y98H VHL mutant (Fig. 3C and D). The increased sensitivity of the
Y112H mutant relative to the Y98H mutant to ChA3 correlates with
the relative levels of the HIF-a subunits and Glut1 protein levels.
These results suggest that it is the diminished ability to suppress
the normoxic stabilization of the HIF-a subunit and the
subsequent transcription directed by HIF that accounts for the
increased sensitivity to ChA3.
HIF-2A increases sensitivity to ChA3. Perturbation of the
HIF-regulatory function of VHL correlates with an increased
susceptibility to ChA3-mediated toxicity. This is supported by our
experiments with VHL mutants with diminished HIF-regulatory
function. We sought to determine if the drugs caused any
appreciable effects on HIF protein levels through Western blot
analysis (Fig. 4A). Pyrazoloacridine caused a slight increase in
HIF-1a and HIF-2a levels at the 4- and 8-h treatment points.

Echinomycin treatment conversely resulted in a modest decrease
in HIF-1a and HIF-2a levels particularly at the later time points.
Interestingly, HIF-1a levels remained stable during the duration of
ChA3 treatment, but a time-dependent increase in HIF-2a levels
was observed beginning at f2 h and continued through the
duration of the 20-h treatment. a-Tubulin protein levels served as
the loading control. Echinomycin treatment resulted in a modest
decrease in HIF-a subunit levels, whereas ChA3 paradoxically
increases the levels of the HIF-2a protein.
A means of directly examining the effects of HIF activity on
ChA3-mediated toxicity is to study mutants of the HIF-a subunit
that escape regulation by the VHL protein. RCC4 cells contain both
HIF-1a and HIF-2a, whereas 786-O cells only have HIF-2a. Thus,
we focused on HIF-2a as the mediator that sensitizes RCC cells
to ChA3. Hydroxylation of Pro531 of HIF-2a is essential for VHL
binding (7, 13). Thus, mutation of HIF-2a P531 to alanine abrogates
binding to VHL and the subsequent degradation. Using sitedirected mutagenesis, we mutated P531 and N847 to alanines;
these two residues are critical to HIF degradation and transcriptional activity, respectively.
Individual clones of HIF-2a degradation-resistant mutant RCC4/
VHL cells were screened for normoxic expression of HIF-2a by
Western blot (Fig. 4B). RCC4/VHL HIF-2a P531A/N847A clones 3
and 17 have levels of HIF-2a comparable with that of the VHLdeficient RCC4 cells. HIF-1a levels were also examined. RCC4 cells

cells had the least. Clones 3 and 17 had HIF-1a levels slightly
elevated relative to RCC4/VHL but much less than RCC4 cells.
Glut1 protein levels were used to assess the level of HIF
transcriptional activity in the HIF-2a P531A/N847A clones. RCC4
cells had the highest level of Glut1 followed by clone 3, clone 17,
and then the RCC4/VHL control cell line. Clones 3 and 17 were
chosen for further evaluation about enhanced ChA3-mediated
cytotoxicity based on the elevated HIF-2a levels and elevated Glut1

levels. Levels of VHL are also shown in Fig. 4B, as well as a-tubulin,
which serves as the loading control.
Normoxic stable expression of HIF-2a mutant protein was tested
for its ability to sensitize VHL-positive cells to the toxic effects of
drugs. HIF-2 transcriptional activity has no influence on the
sensitivity of RCC4/VHL cells to pyrazoloacridine (Fig. 4C).
HIF-2a normoxic stabilization and transcriptional activity, however,
sensitizes the cells to ChA3-mediated toxicity as measured by XTT
assay (Fig. 4C). Clones 3 and 17 overexpressing HIF-2a are more

sensitive to ChA3 than is the control RCC4/VHL cell line, indicating
that normoxic HIF-2a transcriptional activity is sufficient to
sensitize cells to ChA3. Results from the XTT assays were further
confirmed through clonogenic assays (Fig. 4D). Both the XTT and

clonogenic studies indicate that normoxic HIF-2a activity augments
the cytotoxic effects of ChA3. These results indicate not only that
we have identified an agent that selectively targets VHL-deficient
cells. More importantly, this agent is a HIF-dependent cytotoxin.

Drugs in cluster k16.1 with ChA3 are also selectively toxic.
ChA3 is an aureolic acid compound known to bind DNA in the
minor groove, thus altering DNA conformation and inhibiting
transcription. It is not known mechanistically which, if any, of these
characteristics is responsible for the increased toxicity observed in
VHL-deficient cells. We hypothesized that we might gain insight
into the potential mode of differential toxicity through the analysis
of drugs with similar activity profiles to ChA3. Thus, we projected
the activity profile of ChA3 (NSC 58514) onto the anticancer maps
at the 3D Mind Web site.2 Rabow et al. used self-organizing mapbased cluster analysis to classify drugs based on their drug activity
profiles into categories based on their cellular activities. ChA3
projected into cluster k16.1. Fifteen of the compounds found in
cluster k16.1 are listed in Fig. 5A. The final five compounds listed in
Fig. 5A are compounds that have an inverse correlation with ChA3
as examined through COMPARE analysis; each of these drugs is
distributed in a different cluster. Each of the drug profiles listed in
Fig. 5A is plotted in the colorimetric graph (Fig. 5B) versus the cell
lines from the NCI. Mithramycin (an aureolic acid), actinomycin D,
and echinomycin are all found in cluster k16.1 in the antimitotic
region of the self-organizing map. Based on this analysis, the
toxicity of the cluster k16.1 agents echinomycin and actinomycin D
was explored more thoroughly through clonogenic survival studies.
Figure 5C and D contains the results of the survival assays of
echinomycin and actinomycin D, respectively. Preferential elimination of the VHL-deficient RCC4 cells was observed in both

studies, indicating that each of these agents is genotype selective
against VHL-deficient cells. Each of the compounds tested shares
the ability to bind to DNA and inhibit transcription, suggesting that
this may be the mechanism by which differential toxicity is elicited.
ChA3 inhibits tumor growth in vivo. Side-by-side comparison
of ChA3-mediated toxicity in VHL-deficient tumors versus VHLpositive tumors is the defining experiment in evaluating this
strategy in vivo. Figure 6A and B shows the difficulty in completing
a side-by-side in vivo comparison. As VHL is a tumor suppressor
and consistent with numerous published reports, introduction of
VHL into the 786-O cells dramatically inhibits the ability of the cells
to form tumors in nude mice (4). Ten nude mice were injected with
786-O cells in one flank and 786/VHL cells in the opposite flank
and followed over the course of 8 weeks (Fig. 6A). Whereas the
786-O cells formed tumors, tumor formation was suppressed in
the 786/VHL cells. Figure 6B shows a nude mouse 11 weeks after
injection. There is no evidence of 786/VHL tumor in the right
flank but large 786-O tumor is obvious in the left flank. Thus, the
antitumor effects of ChA3 in vivo were tested only against the VHLdeficient 786-O tumors.
786-O tumors were grown until they reached f200 mm3, and
then the nude mice were randomized into either the vehicle
control or the ChA3 treatment groups. Treatment dosage, schedule,
and i.p. injection as the route of administration were chosen based
on data from the DTP. In addition, Pittillo and Woolley (14) found
that relatively high concentrations of ChA3 were maintained in
blood following i.p. administration. Tumors were treated every
3 days for a total of five treatments over the course of 14 days.
Results are graphed in Fig. 6C and photographs are shown in

Fig. 6D. Over the 14-day course of treatment, significant growth
was observed in the control group (n = 8), whereas growth in the
ChA3 treatment group (n = 4) remained static. The antitumor
effects of ChA3 support the concept that loss of VHL can be
targeted in vivo.

Discussion
In this study, we identify a potential new avenue of treatment to
address the dismal outcomes associated with late-stage CC-RCC,
focusing on the lack of an effective and reliable systemic therapy.
Inactivation of the VHL gene is a frequent and critical event in an
estimated 70% of patients with nonhereditary clear cell tumors.
Accordingly, VHL status should weigh heavily in the rational design
of therapies to combat late-stage clear cell disease. Our strategy
was thus to validate the concept of specifically targeting the loss
of the VHL tumor suppressor gene through the pharmacologic
means (15–18).
We specifically focused on the identification of an agent that
showed genotype-selective toxicity against the VHL-deficient CCRCC using publicly available data and analytic tools. This approach
enabled us to rapidly and inexpensively identify several candidate
drugs, four of which were examined more closely for the ability to
preferentially target VHL-deficient cells. Both ChA3 and echinomycin were found to be significantly more toxic to VHL-deficient cells
than to VHL-positive cells. Moreover, simulation of the native tumor
microenvironment through coculture experiments of VHL-deficient
and VHL-positive cells labeled with ECFP and EYFP, respectively,
showed that ChA3 discriminated between the two cell lines as they
grew alongside each other with little, if any, bystander toxicity.
ChA3 also showed activity against VHL-deficient 786-O tumors
in vivo. Successful systemic therapies, likewise, will eradicate VHLdeficient CC-RCC tumor cells while sparing normal VHL-positive
tissue, thus producing fewer therapy-related adverse effects.
Mechanistically, ChA3 is known to bind DNA at the minor groove
and interfere with both cellular replication and transcription.
Interestingly, ChA3 had little effect on HIF-1a protein levels and
increased the levels of HIF-2a protein. Thus, ChA3 does not seem
to mimic the action of VHL with respect to HIF-a subunit stability.
Although the mechanism of action is distinct from VHLreplacement, we define a role for VHL status in modifying the
toxicity of ChA3 with loss of VHL, leading to a greater susceptibility
to ChA3. Thomas et al. have previously shown a role for loss of VHL
in modifying the sensitivity of cells to mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition. In the context of mTOR inhibition,
HIF overexpression rescued the VHL-associated sensitivity to
mTOR inhibition (19). In this study, stable overexpression of a
HIF-2a mutant was able to phenocopy the loss of VHL with respect
to ChA3 toxicity. Thus, ChA3 induces cell death through a HIFdependent mechanism (16, 18). Importantly, we also found that
drugs with similar NCI60 activity profiles to ChA3, specifically
echinomycin and Actinomycin D, showed a genotype-selective
toxicity against the VHL-deficient CC-RCC cells. Echinomycin has
recently been found to inhibit the sequence-specific DNA binding
of the HIF-1 heterodimeric transcription factor (20).
A consequence of the loss of VHL function is the normoxic
accumulation of the a-subunit of the HIF transcription factor and a
subsequent increase in HIF transcriptional activity (21–23). Several
groups have identified agents that functionally impair HIF
transcriptional activity, although most not with the explicit
statement to replace VHL function, likely because the clinical
scope of HIF inhibitors exceeds clear cell renal carcinoma and may

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (12). June 15, 2007

have applications to all solid tumors (24–28). The benefit of HIF
inhibition with regard to tumor growth has also been shown
genetically with respect to s.c. tumor implantation in immunodeficient mice. Genetic inhibition of HIF, however, is not robust to all
tumor microenvironments (29) and it remains to be seen how
effective HIF inhibition is in the context of tumors with longestablished blood supplies. Xenograft studies with 786-O clear cell
renal carcinoma cells have shown tumor suppression with the
substitution of VHL biochemical activity with short hairpin RNA
interference to HIF-2a (30, 31).
In contrast to the restoration of tumor suppressor function, we
sought to target tumor cells through the concept of genotypeselective toxicity. Induction of synthetic lethality in cancer cells is
an emerging paradigm in the treatment of cancer and a potential
means of achieving genotype-selective toxicity. Synthetic lethality
occurs when the combination of two nonallelic and nonlethal
mutations results in cell death. As cancer is a genetic disease that
results from an accumulation of gene mutations and deletions,
inhibiting a second complementary gene through pharmacologic
means could lead to a lethal combination of gene/protein
dysfunction or synthetic lethality (17). Because ChA3 inhibits the
targeted transcription of genes, it is conceivable that ChA3 inhibits
a second allele that, in the combination of loss of VHL, leads to
synthetic lethality. Future studies will focus on identifying specific
target genes that, when inhibited, lead to cell death in the context
of VHL loss.
This strategy is particularly applicable to the loss of tumor
suppressor genes. The VHL gene is ubiquitously expressed in
normal tissues throughout the body; thus, loss of VHL expression is
unique to tumor pathology. The high frequency of VHL inactivation
in RCC makes it nearly universal to the diseased state, and tumor
suppression following reintroduction of VHL into RCC cells
underscores the crucial role of VHL in malignancy. A molecular
defect that is crucial to the malignant phenotype, unique to
diseased tissue, and nearly universal to the diseased state serves as
an ideal target for therapeutic intervention. Pharmacologic agents
that are toxic in the context of VHL disruption should then have
minimal effect on normal tissue.
Systemic therapies have largely been limited in effectiveness due
to adverse effects to normal tissue. Normal tissue toxicity limits
both the maximum tolerated dose as well as the total duration of
treatment. In this study, we narrowed our focus to clear cell renal
carcinoma with nonfunctional VHL. Experiments with ChA3
have been valuable in the course of validating VHL-dependent
cytotoxicity and elucidating the HIF-dependent mechanism.
Exploitation of tumor suppressor loss will hopefully lead to
therapies directed specifically at malignant tissue, reducing normal
tissue toxicity in the process, leading to a greater therapeutic index
and ultimately patient benefit.
