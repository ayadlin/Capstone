ABSTRACT
The chaperone system based on Hsp70 and proteins of the DnaJ family is known
to protect tumor cells from a variety of cytotoxic factors, including anti-tumor
therapy. To analyze whether this also functions in a highly malignant brain tumor,
we knocked down the expression of Hsp70 (HSPA1A) and its two most abundant cochaperones, Hdj1 (DNAJB1) and Hdj2 (DNAJA1) in a C6 rat glioblastoma cell line.
As expected, tumor depletion of Hsp70 caused a substantial reduction in its growth
rate and increased the survival of tumor-bearing animals, whereas the reduction
of Hdj1 expression had no effect. Unexpectedly, a reduction in the expression of
Hdj2 led to the enhanced aggressiveness of the C6 tumor, demonstrated by its rapid
growth, metastasis formation and a 1.5-fold reduction in the lifespan of tumor-bearing
animals. The in vitro reduction of Hdj2 expression reduced spheroid density and
simultaneously enhanced the migration and invasion of C6 cells. At the molecular
level, a knock-down of Hdj2 led to the relocation of N-cadherin and the enhanced
activity of metalloproteinases 1, 2, 8 and 9, which are markers of highly malignant
cancer cells. The changes in the actin cytoskeleton in Hdj2-depleted cells indicate
that the protein is also important for prevention of the amoeboid-like transition of
tumor cells. The results of this study uncover a completely new role for the Hdj2 cochaperone in tumorigenicity and suggest that the protein is a potential drug target.

in their proliferation and poor prognosis in patients with
various cancer localizations [5, 6]. A high level of Hsp70
was found in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, breast
cancer, endometrial carcinoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma
and was correlated with a decreased overall survival
[7–10]. Central nervous system neoplasms, including
low- and high-grade gliomas, are also associated with the
over-expression of Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones [11].
The involvement of Hsp70 in tumor development occurs
at all steps of the tumor progression, but its role in cancer
invasion and metastasis has received much attention in the
past decade [12, 13]. The chaperone has been implicated
in cancer cell motility [14, 15], which might be linked to
the ability of the membrane-bound Hsp70 to influence the
spread of the distant metastasis [16].

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma multiforme is the most aggressive of
brain tumors, with a very poor prognosis. The median survival
of patients with a standard of care therapy that currently
includes surgical removal of the tumor with subsequent
radio- and chemotherapy with temozolomide, does not
exceed 14.6 months [1, 2]. Therefore, the development of
novel therapeutic approaches to glioblastoma treatment and
the discovery of potential drug targets are urgently required.
Molecular chaperones, especially the 70-kDa
heat-shock protein (Hsp70), play an important role in
the processes of protein folding, signal transduction and
general response to stress factors [3, 4]. The expression
of Hsp70 in cancer cells is associated with an increase

The chaperone machinery has been extensively
studied within the last 15–20 years. It was clearly
demonstrated that Hsp70 activity is assisted by J-proteins
that exhibit important intracellular functions, such as
binding to the unfolded client protein and its delivery
to Hsp70, which stimulates Hsp70 ATPase activity [17].
The J-proteins belong to the largest and the most diverged
group of molecular chaperones that contains a conserved
J-domain, which was defined first in the canonical
Escherichia coli chaperone, DnaJ [18]. The family
consists of 49 members and is divided into three groups,
depending on the localization of the J-domain within a
protein molecule. Type I DNAJ proteins (DNAJA, four
members in humans) consist of a N-terminal J-domain,
a glycine-/phenylalanine- (G/F) rich region, a cysteinerepeat (Cys-repeat) region and a largely uncharacterized
C-terminus, whereas type II DNAJ proteins (DNAJB, 13
members) lack the Cys-repeat region and have an extended
G/F rich region. Type III DNAJs (DNAJC, 32 members)
differ substantially from type I and type II DNAJs as they
lack the G/F and Cys-repeat regions and the J-domain can
be situated anywhere within the protein [19–21].
Although the role of Hsp70 in cancer development
is well documented, data concerning the function of its
most abundant cellular co-chaperones, Hdj1 (DNAJB1)
and Hdj2 (DNAJA1), in the process remain elusive. In
this study, we chose the intracranial C6 rat glioblastoma
model and found that the depletion of Hsp70 (HSPA1A)
via lentiviral constructs delayed tumor growth, whereas
the inhibition of Hdj1 resulted in no changes in tumor
development. Surprisingly, knock-down of Hdj2 caused
an increase in C6 tumor growth and strongly reduced
animal survival. The in vitro data led us to conclude
that a reduction in Hdj2 might lead to the pronounced
enhancement of C6 cells tumorigenicity, particularly their
mobility and invasiveness.

roundish and less attached to the substrate, with a considerable
fraction of floating living cells, needle-like protrusions and a
large number of leading edges in the culture. The C6-shHsp70
cells appeared rather elongated and fibroblast-like.
We measured the growth rate and plotted all
four growth curves for 4 days, starting from 5 × 104
cells per mL and found that three cell C6 sub-lines:
C6-wt, C6-shHdj1 and C6-shHdj2 showed practically
indistinguishable growth rates, but C6-shHsp70 grew
slower and reached confluence later (Figure 1C).

The knockdown of chaperones affects
glioblastoma growth in vivo
To estimate the tumor growth following chaperone
knockdown, we used magnetic resonance imaging. For
these experiments C6-wt, C6-shHdj1, C6-shHdj2 and
C6-shHsp70 cells were inoculated into the brain of rats,
constituting four groups of 15 animals in each group. On
the twentieth day following the injection, three animals
from each group were anesthetized and were assessed
using the high-field MR scanner. Two animals from each
group were sacrificed, and the brains were extracted and
fixed in 4% formalin for histological analysis. Another 10
rats remaining in each group were used to evaluate the
survival rate after tumor inoculation.
The C6-wt tumor was represented as a large tumor
with a hypotensive core on the T2-weighted images,
with significantly increased R2 and R2* coefficients of
relaxivity (Figure 2A). The pattern of C6-shHdj1 did not
differ from that in animals with wild-type tumors. The
down-regulation of Hsp70 in C6-shHsp70 cells resulted in
a significant delay in tumor growth in comparison to C6wt or C6-shHdj1 tumors. The border of the C6-shHsp70
glioblastoma was clearly delineated from the surrounding
normal brain tissues. Intriguingly, when the C6-shHdj2
glioblastoma-bearing animals were assessed, we observed
numerous leptomeningeal metastases in all tested animals
(Figure 2A). We found brain-stem C6-shHdj2 metastases
that were highly invasive into the surrounding normal
tissue. The data from MR images were supported by the
histological analysis of the tumor sections (Figure 2B). In
a group of inoculated C6-shHdj2 animal cells, the tumor
was highly invasive into the brain tissue. The dynamics of
glioblastoma growth influenced animal survival (Figure
2C). The overall survival period for C6-wt animals
was 25.5 ± 3.8 days. Down-regulation of Hdj1 did not
influence the survival rate, which was 25.4 ± 3.9 days,
whereas Hsp70 inhibition increased the survival rate by
almost two-fold (up to 42.1 ± 12.3 days). On the contrary,
knock-down of Hdj2 resulted in a decrease in the survival
rate to 16.8 ± 3.5 days, whereas the culture growth rate
remained the same as that of wild type C6. The differences
between survival rate in experimental groups with animals
with C6-wt tumors and with C6-shHsp70 or with C6shHdj2 tumors were statistically significant (p<0.01).

RESULTS
shRNA-mediated knock-down of chaperone gene
expression
To explore the influence of a particular chaperone
level on tumor development, we created three C6-based
cell lines, which constitutively expressed shRNA to
Hdj1, Hdj2 or Hsp70. These cell lines were designated
as C6-shHdj1, C6-shHdj2 and C6-shHsp70, respectively.
The inhibition of gene expression in these cell lines was
established by Western blotting and validated by Image J
software. Compared to the control the concentrations of
the chaperones were reduced as follows: shHdj1 by 92.3%,
shHdj2 by 53.2% and shHsp70 by 87.2% (Figure 1A, 1B).
All obtained cell lines showed slight but stable changes
in cell morphology (data not shown). The C6-shHdj1 cells
were very similar to those of C6-wt, but had fewer side
protrusions; C6-shHdj2 cells appeared to become more

C6 cells with Hdj2 knock-down detached more
readily from the initial population and formed
new growth foci in vitro

for C6-wt cell colonies was 695 ± 116. The C6-shHsp70
cells demonstrated the lowest ability to disseminate and
the number of colonies was 88 ± 64 (Figure 3C).
The spongy structure of C6-shHdj2 spheroids and
the enhanced ability of the cells to detach from the primary
population and to form new distant cellular growth sites
might be due to a loss of specific adhesion molecules such
as cadherins, which are responsible for cell–cell adhesion
[22]. The C6 cells do not express E-cadherin, that was
confirmed by Western blotting (Supplementary Figure S1,
Supplementary Materials), but they possess a high level of
N-cadherin expression (Figure 4A). Importantly, the content
of N-cadherin in C6-shHdj2 cells was higher by 71% than
in C6-wt cells, which contradicts their propensity to detach
from a substrate shown previously. We stained C6 cells
of four sub-lines with an antibody against N-cadherin and
found that despite its elevated content in C6-Hdj2 cells,
N-cadherin does not localize to the plasma membrane as was
shown for C6-wt, -shHdj1, and -shHsp70 cells (Figure 4B).

Since tumors formed by C6-shHdj2 cells did not
have a border with the surrounding tissue, we suggested
that the ability of these cells to form intercellular contacts
is reduced. To analyze this, we formed spheroids using 105
cells of each C6 sub-line. Spheroids created by C6-shHdj2
cells were three-fold larger and had a spongy, crumbly
structure, suggesting that the cells were not connected
tightly to each other and could easily dissociate from the
spheroids (Figure 3A, 3B). Notably, shHsp70 cells formed
more compact and dense spheroids than control cells.
Next, we checked whether C6 cells that are depleted
of chaperones have a distinct ability to separate from the
initial tumor and to attach to a new substrate. To test
whether the floating cells in the C6-shHdj2 population
are viable and can reattach to the substrate, we collected
culture supernatants from C6-wt, -shHdj1, -shHdj2 and
-shHsp70 cells after 18 h of cultivation and reseeded them
to fresh wells of a 24-well plate. After 24 h, we counted the
number of colonies that arose from floating cells. (Figure
3C). The number of colonies was much higher in C6shHdj2 cells and reached 3274 ± 184, whereas the number

invasiveness. To investigate the invasion properties of
the C6 chaperone knock-down sub-lines, we performed
a standard transwell migration assay. We seeded the
cells of interest in the upper part of the Boyden chamber
in serum-free media and observed their migration
to the lower well, containing 10% FBS. Firstly, we
determined the percentage of cells that migrated to
the lower side of the Boyden chamber membrane,
and this was practically the same in all four cell lines
tested (65%). We then counted the colonies that formed
on the bottom of the wells (Figure 5A): C6-shHdj2
formed significantly more colonies (495 ± 57) on the
bottom of the well than the other cell lines. Cells of
C6-shHsp70 line formed more colonies (29 ± 11) than
C6-wt (5 ± 4) and C6-shHdj1 (1 ± 1), which can be
explained by elevated adhesion properties of the cell
line, which allow it to migrate through the membrane

more successfully. Therefore, the decreased adhesion
of C6-shHdj2 cells was nevertheless sufficient for their
migration into the transwell.
To compare the invasive ability of C6 cells with downregulated Hsp70, Hdj1 and Hdj2 chaperones, we also formed
spheriods as described above, embodied them into Matrigel
and incubated for 24 h. During this time, cells liberated from
the spheroid body grew around the spheroids (Figure 5B)
and we estimated the invasion area as a residual between the
total spheroid area with cells growing around and the area
of spheroid body itself (Figure 5C). The invasion area of the
spheroids formed by C6-shHdj1 cells were similar to that of
C6-wt spheroids and comprised 44.9 ± 6.7 and 69.6 ± 6.9
μm2, respectively, whereas the invasion zone of C6-shHsp70
spheroids was smaller and was 37.9 ± 6.8 μm2. The spheroids
formed by C6-shHdj2 cells occupied the highest invasion area,
which extended to 139.6 ± 11.6 μm2. Additionally, we observed

new small structures near larger ones, which probably detached
from “mother” spheroids during incubation. (Figure 5B, 5C).
Another factor that promotes the invasion of
cancer cells is the activity of matrix metalloproteinases
(MMPs) [23], and we measured their activity in cells with
a modified expression of the chaperones. The data from
zymography of the culture medium collected from all C6
cell cultures, show that the Hdj2 knock-down cells indeed,
had a much more active MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-8 and
MMP-9 than C6-wt cells. The activity of these MMPs was
4.8-fold, 2.7-fold and 4.4-fold higher, respectively, in C6shHdj2 than in C6-wt cells (Figure 5D, 5E). The knock-

down of Hsp70 also caused an increase in MMP-9 activity
(3.4-fold compared to C6-wt cells), although other MMPs
were shown to be less active. The down-regulation of Hdj1
resulted in the hyperactivation of MMP-1 (2.4-fold) and
MMP-9 (2.1-fold), but the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-8
did not differ from that of C6-wt cells (Figure 5D, 5E).

The knock-down of Hdj2 in C6 cells increases
their migration ability
The analysis of the cell migration activity of C6-wt,
-shHdj1, -shHdj2 and -shHsp70 was performed using

with floating cells was collected and transferred to wells of six-well plates and left for further 24 h. Colonies formed by attached cells were
calculated using phase-contrast microscopy. The data for three independent experiments are presented.

the scratch and wound-healing assays (Supplementary
Figure S2 in Supplementary Materials). Using both
methods, we showed that the knockdown of Hdj1 does
not influence the migration ability of C6 cells, whereas the
motility of C6-shHsp70 cells was significantly reduced,
reminiscent of their stunted growth in cell culture (Figure
1B) and in the rat brain (Figure 2A). Importantly, C6shHdj2 cells that demonstrated a similar growth rate to
C6-wt cells could form colonies in the center of a scratch
without contacts with the growing edge or with each other.
Simultaneously, detached floating cells were found in the
culture supernatant, demonstrating that C6-Hdj2 cells were
disseminated far beyond the culture edge (Figure 6A).
The mean speed of migrated C6-shHdj2 cells to the scratch
area was 93.5 ± 3.3 μm/day, whereas this value for C6-wt
and C6-shHdj1 cells was 61.2 ± 2.9% and 57.7 ± 1.7 μm/day,
respectively. The C6-shHsp70 cells colonized the scratched
area slower, at a rate of 40.9 ± 1.2 μm/day (Figure 6B).
Similar results were obtained via the wound healing assay
(Supplementary Figure S2 in Supplementary Materials).
Cell migration is a process that requires the
formation of actin-based membrane protrusions on

the leading edge [24]. To analyze the state of the actin
cytoskeleton in modified C6 cells, we stained them with
rhodamine-phalloidin. Cells of all C6 sub-lines except for
C6-shHsp70 contained actin-positive protrusions, but the
number of cells having these specific foci was maximal in
the population of C6-shHdj2 cells, where 50.0 ± 3.5 % of
cells had protrusions, whereas in C6-wt, C6-shHdj1 and
C6-shHsp70 cells, this amount was 22.3 ± 4.5%, 13.6 ±
3.2% and 11.1 ± 1.5%, respectively (Figure 6C, 6D).
The effect of Hdj2 suppression extends not only
C6 cells. We performed similar experiments with shRNA
interference targeting B16 mouse melanoma cells and
found that their migration rate and the expression of two
metalloproteinases 2 and 9 are strongly elevated after
depletion of the co-chaperone (Supplementary Figure S3 in
Supplementary Materials).

DISCUSSION
The major stress protein Hsp70 is over-expressed
in a plethora of human tumors, probably because
cancer cells demonstrate rapid and strong metabolism

and enhanced protein synthesis that require a higher
level of cellular chaperones to regulate the correct
folding of nascent polypeptides and their transport
to target cellular organelles [25]. Another reason for
the increase in Hsp70 in tumor cells is the need for
homeostatic mechanisms based on the chaperone, which

confer efficient tolerance to the effects of chemical and
biological stressors such as reactive oxygen species or
tumor necrosis factor [26].
The function of Hsp70 is aided by DnaJ-like proteins,
which are called co-chaperones and which assist the master
chaperone to recognize the protein substrate and to fold it

correctly; it is clear that the expression of these proteins should
be enhanced in tumors that over-express Hsp70. The analysis
of Hdj1 expression in ovarian, endometrial and uterine tumors
from the City Oncology Clinic (St.Petersburg, Russia) led us to
conclude that the co-chaperone content of tumor cells was high
in benign tumors and was even higher in malignant ones [27].
On the contrary, expression of another member of the family
of DnaJ class proteins, Hdj2, was five-fold lower in pancreatic
cancer cells taken from patients [28]. These examples
highlight the lacunae in our current knowledge of the role
of DnaJ-like proteins in human cancer and require further
investigation.
To elucidate the role of two co-chaperones, Hdj1
and Hdj2, in the pathology of C6 rat glioblastoma, we
generated three sublines of these cells that contained the
knock-down of expression of the master chaperone Hsp70
and both co-chaperones. The C6-wt, -shHdj1 and -shHdj2
cells grew at a similar rate, whereas the growth of C6shHsp70 cells was inhibited (Figure 1). Previously, downregulation of Hsp70 was shown to cause tumor growth
arrest in gastric cancer cells [29] and to promote G2/M
arrest in HeLa cells [30]. The depletion of Hsp70 was also
shown to sensitize myc-overexpressing lymphoid cancer
cells to drug-induced apoptosis [31], moreover, inhibition
of Hsp70 synthesis by transfection of antisense Hsp70
cDNA results in massive death of human breast cancer
cells [32] and caused senescence in cells transformed with
RAS, Her2 or PIK3CA oncogenes [33].
Next, we explored the growth characteristics
of modified tumor cells in vivo. Cells of all four sublines were grafted into rat brains and we found that the
tumors formed by C6-wt and C6-shHdj1 grew at the
same rate, whereas C6-shHsp70 tumors demonstrated
delayed progression in concordance with growth arrest
of in a murine glioblastoma xenografts [34]. Notably, we
found distant tumor lesions on MR images of rat brains
with C6-shHdj2 tumors (Figure 2A). The results of the
histological analysis, which showed that these tumors had
no clear border from the surrounding brain tissue support
the suggestion that knock-down of Hdj2 might cause the
process of metastasis.
Metastasis formation is a complex process that starts
from the detachment of solitary tumor cells from the body
of a primary tumor and the invasion of lymphatic vessels
and capillaries [35]. To analyze whether C6-shHdj2 cells
demonstrate typical features of a metastasizing tumor, we
performed in vitro experiments that aimed to measure the
ability to detach and to form colonies. Firstly, we found
that C6-shHdj2 cells can dissociate from the original
tumor cell monolayer more readily than the cells of the
other three sub-lines (Figure 3). We believe that this
behavior of C6-shHdj2 cells correlates with the first stage
of a tumor metastasis cascade [36].
Another feature of metastasizing cancer cells is
the loss of intercellular contacts that are provided by
cadherins shown to be tissue-specific [37]: E-cadherin
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

is specific for endothelial tissues, N-cadherin was found
in the brain and P-cadherin is present in the placenta. In
most epithelial cancers, the loss of E-cadherin leads to the
transition to a mesenchymal, migratory, and invasive cell
phenotype, a process called the epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition [38]. Although C6 glioblastoma cells do not
express E-cadherin (Supplementary Figure S1), the level of
N-cadherin was found to be much higher in C6 cells with
down-regulated Hdj2 than in cells of other sub-lines (Figure
4A). The increase in N-cadherin expression was observed
at an early stage in more invasive and less differentiated
breast cancer cell lines that lacked E-cadherin expression
[39] and in squamous carcinomas [40]. It was proposed that
N-cadherin contributes directly to the invasive phenotype.
Using confocal microscopy, we found that N-cadherin
disappeared from the cell surface of C6-shHdj2 cells, which
might explain the weak contacts between these cells (Figure
4B). To our knowledge, this is the first observation of the
redistribution of N-cadherin in highly tumorigenic cells.
The surface expression and function of cell adhesion
molecules like N-cadherin are modulated by endocytosis
and recycling [41, 42] and causes by the defect observed
with loss of function of Rab GTPases [43]. In Rab5 deficient
neurons an increased surface expression of N-cadherin
and an altered N-cadherin distribution between the cell
body and the processes was observed. Rab7 deficient cells
had increased total cellular level of N-cadherin, which is
consistent with a decrease lysosomal degradation of protein.
Rab1 deficiency caused an accumulation of N-cadherin in
cytoplasmic vesicles [42, 44]. As a co-chaperone and apart
its chaperonic function Hdj2 is able to bind cellular proteins
and Rabs proteins could be among its partners. To favor of
this suggestion is the fact that Hdj2 diminishes extracellular
Hsp70 transport from cancer cells (Shevtsov et al., paper in
preparation). The future proteomic analysis of Hdj2-binding
proteins could unveil this question.
Invasion is a critical step in the metastatic cascade
and to measure this property of C6 cell sub-lines, we used
a morphological approach, using cell-spheroid growth
in a matrigel. This novel method recently described by
Chandrasekaran and coauthors (2015) was applied to the
analysis of HCT116 colon cancer cells that completely
lacked the expression of the PTEN tumor suppressor
gene [45]. The results of this assay showed that spheroids
formed by C6-shHdj2 cells with the extensions formed
by the cells liberated from spheroid body, occupy a 2.5fold greater area than those of the other cells (Figure 5A,
5B). In a view of data of Chandrasekaran et al it worth
mentioning that the knock-down of two completely
unrelated genes and their products stimulate the burst
of cancer metastasis. Metalloproteinases also serve as
important markers for the final stage of the metastatic
process [46]. The results of zymography showed that
C6-shHdj2 cells possess highly active MMP-1 and
-2 (Figure 5D, 5E), whose activation was already
demonstrated in a variety of human cancers [47].

Metastatic cells possess the enhanced motility
associated with the proper function of the actin
cytoskeleton and we studied the latter in C6 cell sub-lines.
Using the scratch test, we found that the rate of migration
of C6-shHdj2 cells was 1.5-fold higher than that of other
cells (Figure 6A, 6B). Similar data were reported for
the behavior of multiple myeloma cells that possessed a
knock-down in expression of the SPRY2 gene [48] and
after pharmacological inhibition of expression of the
urokinase-type plasminogen activator in human breast
carcinoma cells [49]. The results of the scratch-test were
confirmed by the wound-healing assay, which showed that
C6-shHdj2 cells migrated to the wound area faster than
cells of other sub-lines (Supplementary Figure S2); again,
this agrees well with previous data of Zhang et al. [49]
for cells that acquire a more metastatic phenotype. Indeed,
actin distribution analysis confirmed that C6-shHdj2 cells
attain additional protrusions that can be stained with

phalloidin compared to C6 cells of other sub-lines (Figure
6C, 6D). This signifies that the cells with a lower content
of the Hdj2 co-chaperone have better developed actin
bundles, thus enabling them to reach the site of metastasis
formation more efficiently [see 50 for review].
Taken together, these data show that the depletion
of Hdj2 in C6 glioblastoma cells leads to a highly
aggressive tumor phenotype with all attributes of
actively metastasizing cells, including detachment from
the primary tumor, increased motility and invasion
characteristics.
The role of J-domain-containing proteins in cancer
development is obscure; Hdj2 expression was five-fold
lower in samples from patients with pancreatic cancer
[51, 28]. The elevated expression of Hdj2 in glioblastomas
led to radiosensitization, whereas its low expression
was linked to radioresistance [52]. The members of the
B-subfamily of J-proteins, HLJ1 (DNAJB4) and MRJ

Figure 6: Downregulation of Hdj2 in C6 cells modulates the ability for cell migration. A. Glioblastoma cells of C6-wt, C6-

shHsp70, C6-shHdj1 and C6-shHdj2 lines were cultured in six-well plates. A straight scratch was made in individual wells with a 200-μL
pipette tip, and the wound was photographed under a microscope after 48 h of incubation. B. The distance that each individual cell migrated
within the wound area during 48 h of cultivation was measured using Image J software. C. Cells of C6-wt, C6-shHsp70, C6-shHdj1 and C6shHdj2 were stained with Phalloidin-Rhodamine and images were taken with a confocal microscope. Protrusions stained with PhalloidinRhodamine are indicated with green arrows. D. The number of cells with a protrusion was calculated for each C6 sub-line.

(DNAJB6), demonstrated a similar behavior to that of
Hdj2 shown in this study.
The positive and negative regulation of J-domainproteins was recently reported by two groups. In one study,
MRJ was found to be in a triple complex with Hsp70 and
a urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor; the
knock-down of MRJ (or Hsp70) caused the dissociation
of the complex and inhibited the expression of MMP-2
and MMP9 [53]. These data contrast with the findings
of Mirta and coauthors [54], who demonstrated that
the upregulation of MRJ synthesis inhibited migration,
invasion and tumorigenesis in breast cancer.
The other member of the DNAJB family is HLJ1,
which is a potential marker of colorectal cancer-cell
metastasis. The expression of HLJ1 was lower in samples
from patients with highly metastatic colorectal cancer than
in lowly metastatic samples. Moreover, patients with a high
level of HLJ1 had a better overall survival rate than patients
with a low rate [55]. The high expression of HLJ1 in nonsmall-cell lung carcinomas inhibited proliferation, growth,
motility and invasion and promoted apoptosis [56].
It appears that Hsp70 master chaperone and its
assistants belonging to the DNAJ family may play
opposite roles in a cancer cell: the co-chaperones tune the
cancer cell mechanism to low progression, whereas Hsp70
protects the cell against anti-tumor therapy.
Hypothetically, Hdj2 can influence the tumor-cell
phenotype, due to its membrane-associated localization,
which can be lost upon heat shock [57] or farnesyltransferase inhibition [58]. Evidence for its function
derived from the results of high throughput screening,
in which Hdj2 was found to associate with integrinlinked kinase (ILK) [59]. Since ILK mediates integrin
signal transduction, Hdj2 can affect the cell architecture,
adhesion and migration along integrin substrates.
In conclusion, Hdj2 functions as a co-chaperone
of Hsp70; however, recent data and our results suggest
that the former can also play individual role in tumor
progression, which as shown here, is very important.

(D8.91) and envelope (pVSV-G) plasmids were kindly
provided by Dr. L. Glushankova (Institute of Cytology
of RAS, Russia). The HEK-293T cells were transfected
using PEI (polyethylenimine) with a mixture of all three
plasmids. The supernatants of the cultures were harvested
and concentrated using PEG/NaCl solution [60]. The titers
of lentivirus were determined by the formation of colonies
of infected cells that were resistant to puromycin. Cells
were selected on puromycin (2.0 μg/mL; Sigma, USA) at
least 2 weeks prior to the start of experiments.
For the analysis of glioblastoma cell proliferation, a
growth curve was plotted for each obtained C6 cell line (C6-wt,
C6-shHsp70, C6-shHdj1, C6-shHdj2). The baseline cellular
density was 5 × 104 cells/mL. The C6 cell concentration was
measured every day with a Neubauer Chamber counting.

Orthotopic model of rat glioblastoma
Male Wistar rats weighing 250–300 g were
purchased from an animal nursery (“Rappolovo” RAMN,
St. Petersburg, Russia). Animals were anesthetized
before mounting in a stereotactic frame (David Kopf
Instruments, Tujunda, CA) with 10 mg “Zoletyl-100”
(tiletamine hydrochloride and zolazepam, “Virbac
santé Animale”, France) and 0.2 mL, 2% Rometar
(xylazinum hydrochloride, “Bioveta”, Czech Republic)
intraperitoneally. The C6 glioblastoma cells were
inoculated (4 × 106 cells/mL; 15 μL) into the nucl.
caudatus dexter. Fifteen animals were assigned to each
experimental group (i.e., C6-wt, C6-shHsp70, C6shHdj1, and C6-shHdj2). The studies were performed in
accordance with the ethical standards and according to
the Declaration of Helsinki and national and international
guidelines and were approved by the institutional ethical
committee.
For analysis of the glioblastoma invasion on the
twentieth day following cell inoculation, animals were
sacrificed and the brains extracted and fixed in 4 %
formalin. Brain tumor cryosections were stained with
DAPI and rhodamine-phalloidin. Images were obtained
using confocal microscopy.
The MRI was acquired using a high-field 11.0 T MR
scanner (Bruker, Germany) and a head coil. Anesthesized
rats were positioned with the tumor centered on the
surface coil. Coronal single-slice spin echo images were
selected on orthogonal images through the center of the
tumor. Images were obtained using following regimes:
TurboRARE-T2 (repetition time [TR]/echo time [TE]
4200/36 ms, flip angle (FA)180°, field of vision (FoV)
2.5 × 2.5 cm, matrix 256 × 256), RARE-T1 (TR/TE

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells
The C6 glioblastoma and HEK-293T cells were
provided by the Russian Cell Culture Collection from the
Institute of Cytology of the Russian Academy of Sciences
(RAS) (St. Petersburg, Russia). The C6 cells were grown in
DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine and antibiotics (100 U/
mL penicillin G and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin). Cells were
grown in a CO2-incubator with 6% CO2 and 90% humidity.
Viability was determined by 0.4% trypan blue exclusion.
All culture reagents were purchased in PanEco (Russia).
Vector plasmids for knock-down of Hsp70 and its cochaperones were purchased from GE Dnarmacon, CO, USA:

of one 24-well plate were washed to remove detached
cells with 0.01M phosphate-buffer solution (PBS),
and photographed. Cell growth was assessed after 48 h
following scratching after the images were captured. The
gap distance was measured and the mean was calculated
for each cell line.

Survival analysis

The colony-formation test

Following injection of the glioblastoma cells for
survival analysis, animals were divided into four groups
(10 rats each) as follows: (1) C6-wt, (2) C6-shHsp70, (3)
C6-shHdj1, and (4) C6-shHdj2. Kaplan-Meier survival
curves were plotted for the four experimental groups.

The colony-formation test was performed in two
variants: (1) colony formation by cells from conditioned
culture medium containing detached cells that could
form colonies on the new substrate. The C6-wt, -shHdj1,
-shHdj2 and -shHsp70 cells were seeded into wells of 24well plates at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells/mL and were
allowed to attach to the bottom for 4 h, after which, fresh
medium was introduced to remove floating cells and cells
were incubated for 18 h. The culture media were collected
and transferred to the wells of six-well plates. Twenty
four hours later, the colonies formed by the attached cells
were fixed with ice-cold methanol, stained with 0.1%
crystal violet and forming colonies were calculated using
phase-contrast microscopy. (2) Cells of the four C6 sublines were seeded in a Boyden camber (8-μm pores) at a
concentration of 2 x 105 cells/mL in serum-free medium.
The chambers were inserted into wells of a 24-well plate
that contained 0.75 mL medium with 10% of FBS for 24 h.
Twenty h later, the cells on the outer membrane and the
bottom of the plates were fixed and stained as described
above and cells and colonies were calculated.

Western blot
The knock-down of Hsp70, Hdj1 and Hdj2 in C6
cells was verified by Western blot analysis. The C6 cells
selected with puromycin (3 × 105) were lyzed on ice
in solution containing 20 mM TrisHCl pH 7.5, 20 mM
NaCl, 0.01% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF,
10 μg/mL leupeptin, 10 μg/mL pepstatin. Equal amounts
of protein (50 μg/lane) were electrophorezed in a 10%
SDS polyacrylamide gel. Following transfer to the PVDF
membrane non-specific binding was blocked with 5%
fat free milk in PBS overnight at +4°C. The membranes
were further incubated overnight at 4°C with monoclonal
mouse antibodies as follows: J32 antibodies for Hdj1and
3C5 for Hsp70 produced at Institute of Cytology of RAS,
KA2A5.6 antibodies for Hdj2 and an anti-N-cadherin
antibody (both Abcam, UK).
A loading control was performed via tubulin
detection (UBP-bio). Following incubation with primary
antibodies, membranes were washed and incubated with
horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibodies (Sigma, USA).

Spheroid formation and the spheroid invasion test
Ninety-six-well plates were coated with 50 μL 1.5 %
agarose and cells were seeded at a concentration of 2 × 105
cells/mL to form spheroids during overnight incubation.
To assay the invasion ability, the obtained spheroids
were placed on the Matrigel layer in 96-well plates and
matrigel was added to the culture medium to form a
gel. The spheroids were incubated overnight and were
photographed. The size of the spheroids and their invasion
edges were determined using the function “Measure” in
Image J software.

Confocal microscopy
To establish whether the N-cadherin locates
of on cell surface C6 cells of all four sub-lines were
allowed to settle on cover glass slides and stained with
anti Hdj2 antibody (Abcam, UK) on ice, fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde and incubated with secondary antirabbit antibody labeled with Alexa488 (Sigma, USA).
Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2- phenylindole
(DAPI). Fluorescence images were captured with the use
of Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope (Leica, Germany).

Zymography of matrix metalloproteinases
The C6-wt, C6-shHdj1, C6-shHdj2 and C6shHsp70 cells were seeded into wells of 24-well plates
at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells/mL and were cultured
in standard conditions overnight. The following day, the
wells were washed, the culture medium was replaced with
serum-free medium and the cells were cultured for 48 h
in standard conditions. The culture media were collected
and centrifuged at 300 g for 10 min, to remove floating
cells and following subsequent centrifugation at 10,000
g for 10 min to remove cellular debris. Then, 50 μL of
each medium was mixed with zymography sample buffer

In vitro scratch assay
A scratch assay was used to analyze cell motility:
105 C6 cells with down-regulated chaperones were
seeded into the wells of a 24-well plate and were cultured
overnight. The in vitro scratch assay was performed using
a sterile 200-μL pipette tip to scratch several straight lines
on the cell monolayer. Immediately after scratching, wells

(Laemmli buffer without dithiothreitol) and PAGE was
performed with gels containing 1 mg/mL gelatin or 0,5
mg/mL casein. The gels were washed twice with 2.5%
Triton X-100 for 30 min and were incubated for 12 h in
reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.6, 0.15 M NaCl,
10 MM CaCl2 and 0.05 % Brij 35) and stained with
Coomassie blue G-250 to reveal the zones corresponding
to MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-8 and MMP9. The quantitative
characteristics of the matrix metalloprotease activity were
analyzed using the function “Gels” in Image J software.
