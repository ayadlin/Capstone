Abstract
Many signal transduction inhibitors are being developed for
cancer therapy target pathways that are also important for the
proper function of antitumor lymphocytes, possibly weakening their therapeutic effects. Here we show that most inhibitors
targeting multiple signaling pathways have especially strong
negative effects on T-cell activation at their active doses on
cancer cells. In particular, we found that recently approved
MEK inhibitors displayed potent suppressive effects on T cells
in vitro. However, these effects could be attenuated by certain
cytokines that can be administered to cancer patients. Among

them, clinically available IL15 superagonists, which can activate PI3K selectively in T lymphocytes, synergized with MEK
inhibitors in vivo to elicit potent and durable antitumor
responses, including by a vaccine-like effect that generated
resistance to tumor rechallenge. Our work identiﬁes a clinically
actionable approach to overcome the T-cell–suppressive effects
of MEK inhibitors and illustrates how to reconcile the deﬁciencies of signal transduction inhibitors, which impede
desired immunologic effects in vivo. Cancer Res; 76(9); 2561–72.

Introduction

The FDA-approved small-molecule inhibitor of MEK, trametinib, presents an example of seemingly paradoxical interactions
with host antitumor immunity. Studies have shown that proper Tcell activation and proliferation is impaired by pharmacologic
inhibition of MEK signaling with trametinib (3, 4) and other
compounds (5). These data seem to imply that trametinib would
impair antitumor T-cell function in tumor-bearing hosts. However, it was recently found that although trametinib impairs T-cell
function in vitro, it does not limit the effectiveness of either
adoptive cell therapy (6) or checkpoint blockade with antibodies
against PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 (7) in mouse models. A potential explanation is that trametinib in these studies was coadministered with high doses of IL2 (6) and checkpoint inhibitors (7)
that enhance the activation of T cells, thus allowing them to
overcome small-molecule inhibition of MEK. The possibility that
cytokines can rescue some deleterious effects associated with MEK
inhibition on T cells has yet to be explored. In addition, MEK
inhibition of tumor cells can lead to increased expression of
tumor-speciﬁc antigens (5, 8), potentially enhancing recognition
of tumors by CD8þ effector T cells, which offers another explanation for the synergy with immunotherapies. At the moment, the
mechanisms explaining the paradoxical effects of MEK inhibitors
on T-cell–mediated antitumor immunity remain elusive.
In a rapidly changing clinical scenario, ﬁrst-line PD-1 inhibitors, alone or in combination with CTLA-4 inhibitors, may
become a standard of care in the near future against tumors
such as melanoma (9). However, the combined effects and
optimal sequencing of targeted therapies and immunotherapy
remains unknown. Clarifying the immunosuppressive effects of
targeted therapies in vivo is crucial for the design of synergistic
combinatorial interventions with emerging immunotherapies.
Trametinib was the ﬁrst MEK inhibitor to be approved for
clinical use in 2013, and it has demonstrated to improve overall

Small-molecule inhibitors targeting oncogenic signaling pathways have emerged as a promising new class of drugs in cancer
therapy. While these molecules undergo rigorous testing to demonstrate their efﬁcacy in tumor models, their effects on the
interplay between leukocytes and tumors have been largely
unstudied because of the use of preclinical xenograft models that
lack a competent immune system. T cells, crucial for controlling
the growth of immunogenic tumors (1), rely upon many of the
same signaling pathways targeted by pharmaceutical inhibitors
for activation of cytotoxicity against tumor cells. For instance,
engagement of the T-cell receptor (TCR) and costimulatory receptors activates the RAS–MAPK and PI3K–AKT signaling cascades,
which are necessary for proliferation and effector function in
T cells (2).

survival in combination with other targeted interventions (10).
To elucidate the effects of multiple targeted therapies on the
tumor immunoenvironment and, subsequently, antitumor
immunity, we analyzed a panel of molecules for their inhibitory activity on T cells. Our results indicate that most smallmolecule inhibitors, and in particular trametinib, exert direct
suppressive effects on human T cells in vitro and antitumor
mouse T cells in vivo in preclinical cancer models. However, the
suppressive effects of MEK inhibitors can be overcome by
various cytokines. We found that clinically available IL15
agonists, through a mechanism dependent on the activation
of PI3K, were particularly effective at rescuing T-cell function.

Materials and Methods
Animals, tissues, and cell lines
WT C57BL/6 and congenic Ly5.1 female 6- to 8-week-old mice
were procured from the NCI or Charles River Laboratories. OT-I
C57BL/6-Tg (TcraTcrb)1100Mjb/J transgenic mice were obtained
from The Jackson Laboratory. Transgenic Krastm4Tyj and
Trp53tm1Brn mice (11, 12) were obtained from NCI Mouse Models
of Human Cancers Consortium, brought to a full C57BL/6 background (13, 14). All animals were maintained in speciﬁc pathogen-free barrier facilities and used in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Wistar Institute.
The Brpkp110 primary mammary tumor cell line was generated
by culturing a mechanically dissociated C57BL/6 L-Stop-LKrasG12Dp53ﬂx/ﬂxL-Stop-L-Myristoylated p110aGFPﬂx/þ primary
breast tumor mass as described previously (15). Tumor cells were
passaged a total of ten times and tested for mycoplasma before
deriving the Brpkp110 cell line. Tumors were initiated by injecting
5  105 cells into the axillary ﬂanks. Tumor volume was calculated
as: 0.5  (L  W2), where L is the longer of the two measurements.
Peripheral blood lymphocytes were obtained by leukapheresis/
elutriation and Miltenyi bead–puriﬁed. A2780 cells were
obtained from AddexBio Technologies. ID8 cells (16) were provided by K. Roby (Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology,
University of Kansas, Kansas City, KS) and retrovirally transduced
to express Defb29 and Vegf-a (17) or OVA (18).
T-cell stimulation
For human T-cell proliferation assays, K562 cells expressing
human CD32, termed K32, were generated as described (19),
g-irradiated (100 Gy) and loaded with anti-CD3 (500 ng/mL,
clone OKT3; eBioscience) plus anti-CD28 (500 ng/mL, clone
15E8; EMD Millipore) antibodies at room temperature for 10
minutes [artiﬁcial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs)]. Peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were labeled with Cell Trace
Violet (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions
and cocultured with loaded aAPCs at a 10:1 PBMC:aAPC ratio or
activated with Concanavalin A (ConA; 2 mg/mL, Sigma). Proliferation of T cells was determined 7 days later by FACS and division
index was calculated using FlowJo software.
For mouse T-cell proliferation assays, pan-T cells were negatively puriﬁed from spleens with antibodies to B220 (RA3), Mac-1
(M170.13), and MHC-II (M5/114) using magnetic beads. T cells
were labeled with Cell Trace Violet (Invitrogen) and stimulated
with either agonistic CD3/CD28 beads (Dynabeads, Life Technologies) or tumor-pulsed bone marrow dendritic cells (BMDC)
and analyzed for proliferation by FACS either 3 days (CD3/CD28
beads) or 7 days (BMDCs) later. Day 7 BMDCs were generated as

2562 Cancer Res; 76(9) May 1, 2016

described previously (20) and cultured overnight with doubleirradiated (g-irradiated, 100 Gy; and UV, 30 minutes) ID8Defb29/Vegf-a cells. BMDCs were added to cultures of T cells at
a 10:1 (T cell:BMDC) ratio. For recall ELISpot assays, mouse T cells
were primed with tumor-pulsed BMDCs plus IL2 (30 U/mL) and
IL7 (5 ng/mL), and restimulated 7 days later with fresh tumorpulsed BMDCs at a 10:1 ratio in an IFN- ELISpot (eBioscience).
Compounds and cytokines
ALT-803 was generously provided by Altor BioScience
Corporation and was diluted in sterile PBS for in vitro and
in vivo studies. Recombinant human IL15 (Novoprotein),
human IL2, human IL21, mouse IL7 (Peprotech), human IL27
(eBioscience), and ConA (Type VI, Sigma-Aldrich) were reconstituted in sterile PBS and stored at 20o C. Trametinib
(GSK-1120212) was purchased from LC Laboratories and suspended in vehicle solution of 10% PEG-300 (Sigma-Aldrich)
and 10% Cremophor EL (EMD Millipore) in sterile dH20 for
in vivo oral gavage experiments. For in vitro assays, all inhibitors were dissolved in sterile DMSO and diluted in the assays
1:1,000, so that the ﬁnal concentration of DMSO was 0.1%.
Cell proliferation assays
Compound screening on A2780 cells was performed by adding
compounds the morning after plating and measuring proliferation 72 hours later. Screening on human PBMCs was performed
by adding compounds simultaneously with ConA stimulation (2
mg/mL) and measuring proliferation 7 days later. Normalized
percent inhibition (NPI) was calculated by measuring resazurin
ﬂuorescence with respect to values obtained with DMSO-negative
control and doxorubicin (5 mmol/L) positive control as NPI ¼
100%  (DMSO – compound)/(DMSO – doxorubicin).
Western blotting
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) with
Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (Halt Phosphatase Inhibitor, Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc, and Na3VO4, 1 mmol/L) and cleared by centrifugation.
Proteins were quantiﬁed by BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc),
diluted in reducing Lamelli buffer, denatured at 95 C, run on mini
Protean TGX Ready Gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories), transferred to a
polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membrane, blocked, and incubated
with primary antibodies for p-ERK1/2 (D13.14.4E), p-AKT
(D9E), and b-tubulin (9F3), all from Cell Signaling Technology;
plus b-actin (Sigma; AC-15). Immunoreactive bands were developed using horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) and ECL substrate (GE Healthcare).
TCR ligation of human CD8 T cells
CD8þ T cells were sorted from PBMCs and rested overnight in
R10. T cells (0.5  106 per condition) were stained with OKT3biotin (BioLegend, 10 mg/mL) for 15 minutes on ice, and washed
in cold PBS. TCR ligation was performed by adding streptavidin
(Promega, 25 mg/mL) and anti-CD28 antibody (Millipore, clone
15E8, 1 mg/mL) in the presence of indicated inhibitors for 10
minutes at 37 C.
In vivo OT-I proliferation
Congenic Ly5.1 mice were injected with 1.5  106 ID8-OVA
cells intraperitoneally (21). Mice were oral gavaged with trametinib or vehicle on days 9–13. On day 10, mice were injected

Results
Multiple targeted small-molecule inhibitors suppress human
T-cell activation in vitro
To determine the sensitivity of human T cells to inhibition of
signaling pathways commonly targeted by small molecules in
cancer therapy (22), we ﬁrst designed a high-throughput assay to
test a diverse panel of 41 inhibitors over a 6 log concentration
range on ConA-induced activation and expansion of human
T cells from PBMCs. At doses equivalent to or below those

required to limit proliferation of A2780 ovarian cancer cells,
known to be sensitive to PI3K and MEK inhibitors (23, 24), a
variety of inhibitor classes prevented ConA-driven T-cell expansion (Fig. 1A). Small molecules targeting PI3K, mTOR, MAPK,
and CDK signaling, as well as transcriptional regulators [histone
deacetylase (HDAC)] and survival molecules (Bcl-2) were
deleterious for T-cell expansion. Among these, trametinib, the
MEK1/2 inhibitor approved by the FDA for BRAF-mutant melanoma, was particularly potent at inhibiting the in vitro proliferation of human T cells. Overall, the observed EC50 of every
tested molecule with some activity on A2780 cells was lower for
human T cells than for A2780 cells (Table 1; Supplementary
Fig. S1 and S2), highlighting the immunosuppressive effects of
most small-molecule targeted therapies.
We validated our screening approach by focusing on inhibitors
of the PI3K and MEK signaling pathways. Abrogation of T-cell

activation elicited by small-molecule inhibitors was not restricted
to ConA stimulation, because pan-PI3K (BKM120) and MEK
(GDC0973) inhibitors also restricted the proliferation of human
T cells in response to aAPC coated with agonistic CD3 and CD28
antibodies (Fig. 1B; ref. 19). Importantly, these effects were
consistent among three different donors (Fig. 1C). Comparable
results were obtained with the MEK inhibitor trametinib (Fig.
1D). As expected, T cells were more sensitive to kinase inhibitors
when they were activated in the absence of costimulation (aAPCs
lacking anti-CD28), as could occur within the immunosuppressive microenvironment of tumor-bearing hosts (Fig. 2A and B).
We noticed only minor and nonsigniﬁcant differences in the
repertoire of memory and effector T-cell subsets when cultures
were activated without anti-CD28 and with lower amounts of
anti-CD3, indicating that differences in sensitivity to the kinase
inhibitors cannot be attributed to altered T-cell differentiation
(Supplementary Fig. S3A–SD).
To determine the effects of MEK and pan-PI3K inhibitors on different T-cell subsets, we FACS puriﬁed human

2564 Cancer Res; 76(9) May 1, 2016

CD8 T cells into na€ve, memory, and effector populations
based upon CD45RA and CD27 expression and activated
them with aAPCs. We found that trametinib equally inhibited proliferation of na€ve (CD45RAþCD27þ), memory
(CD45RACD27þ), and effector/effector memory (CD45RACD27) cells, although one donor showed a trend that memory
and effector/effector memory cells were less sensitive than na€ve
cells to trametinib (Fig. 3A and B). Interestingly, memory and
effector/effector memory cells were more sensitive to PI3K inhibition with BKM120 than na€ve cells, a result consistent among
three donors (Fig. 3C and D). Differentiated effector cells
(CD45RAþCD27) did not proliferate in response to aAPCs, so
we could not conclude their sensitivity to kinase inhibition from
this analysis (Supplementary Fig. S4A).
We also explored the result of MEK and PI3K inhibition on
physiologic activation of T cells with tumor antigens. MEK and
PI3K inhibitors completely abrogated the initial priming response
of murine T cells activated with tumor lysate-pulsed DCs
(13, 20; Fig. 3E and F). More importantly, the direct suppressive

effects of these inhibitors were not restricted to proliferative
responses, because the frequency of tumor-primed T cells secreting IFNg in response to restimulation with fresh tumor lysate–
pulsed DCs was also signiﬁcantly reduced when either PI3K or
MEK were inhibited (Fig. 3G and H).

Overall, these data underscore the T-cell–suppressive effects of
most small-molecule targeted therapies clinically approved or in
the pipeline of clinical development, at a time when combinatorial immunotherapeutic interventions are being tested against
multiple tumors.

IL15 rescues the suppressive effects of MEK inhibitors through
PI3K activation
Despite the strong T-cell inhibitory activity of FDA-approved
trametinib on both initial priming and recall responses, recent
reports suggest that trametinib does not limit the effectiveness of
adoptive cell therapy in preclinical tumor models (6). Interestingly, these studies included the administration of high doses of
IL2. We reasoned that cytokines signaling on immune (but not
tumor) cells could rescue the deleterious effects of trametinib on
T-cell activity. We therefore tested a panel of cytokines known to
play a role in T-cell survival and proliferation for their ability to
recover T-cell expansion from MEK inhibition. Supporting our
hypothesis, IL2, IL7, and IL15 were able to individually rescue the
proliferation of human T cells in the presence of trametinib
(Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S4B). In contrast, IL21 and IL27
had no signiﬁcant rescuing effect (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig.
S4B). Among all cytokines tested, we focused on IL15 because it

www.aacrjournals.org

provides a strong stimulating signaling to both effector and
memory CD8þ T cells without inducing the expansion of Tregs,
as compared with IL2 (25, 26). Indeed, IL15 was able to dramatically rescue the proliferation of puriﬁed CD8 na€ve, memory, and
effector/effector memory T cells (Fig. 4B).
We found that IL15 can rescue early (within 10 minutes
postactivation) TCR-induced MAPK signaling from MEK inhibition, as shown by ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4C). Mechanistically, this effect depends on activation of PI3K by IL15 (27),
because IL15 was not able to rescue the defect in ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the presence of a pan-PI3K inhibitor (Fig. 4C).
Furthermore, activation of protein kinase C (PKC) with phorbol12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) completely overcomes the suppressive effect of PI3K inhibition on ERK1/2 phosphorylation
without fully restoring PI3K activity as assayed by AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 4C). This is consistent with a mechanism of ERK
phosphorylation (28) mediated by the activation of PKC isoforms

upon stimulation of the PI3K pathway, which is known to result
in the production of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate
(PIP3) and, subsequently, activation of PDK1 kinase (29).
Together, these results show that IL15 can augment early signaling
events downstream of TCR activation to enhance the amplitude of
MAPK signaling to overcome MEK1/2 inhibition by trametinib.
The IL15 superagonist ALT-803 overcomes the suppressive
effects of trametinib in vivo in tumor-bearing hosts
To deﬁne whether IL15 signaling can overcome MEK inhibition-induced suppression of T-cell activation in the tumor microenvironment in vivo, we investigated the IL15 superagonist ALT803 (30) for its ability to rescue T-cell functions from MEK
inhibition. ALT-803 is a new IL15 superagonist complex with
IL15N72D bound to the IL15RaSu/Fc (30). This IL15N72D:
IL15RaSu/Fc has a signiﬁcantly longer serum half-life and
increased biologic activity compared with native IL15 (30) and
is undergoing extensive clinical testing (Supplementary Table S1).
In this study, we found that ALT-803 was more effective than IL7
(Fig. 4D) and IL15 (Fig. 5A and B) in rescuing human T-cell
proliferation in vitro. Human T-cell proliferation in the presence of
ALT-803 remained unaffected by trametinib, even at the relatively
high concentration of 5 mmol/L (Fig. 5B). As was the case for IL15,
we found that ALT-803 activity was also dependent on PI3K
signaling because T-cell expansion could not be fully rescued
when pan-PI3K and MEK inhibitors were combined (Fig. 5B). We
determined that the reduction in proliferation when pan-PI3K
and MEK inhibitors were combined was due to a block in cell
division rather than an increase in cell death (Supplementary Fig.
S5A–S5E).
ALT-803 was also able to rescue the proliferation of puriﬁed
human CD8þ na€ve, memory, and effector/effector memory T
cells from trametinib, indicating broad activity on a range of T-cell
subsets (Supplementary Fig. S6A). Intriguingly, ALT-803 (and
IL15 for one donor) induced the proliferation of puriﬁed, differentiated effector (CD45RAþCD27) CD8þ T cells that were
otherwise unable to proliferate in response to CD3/CD28 activation (Supplementary Fig. S4A). ALT-803 showed activity on
mouse T cells as well, demonstrated by its ability to restore
proliferation of bead-activated T cells (Fig. 5C) and IFNg recall
responses of tumor-primed T cells in the presence of trametinib
(Fig. 5D).
To test the activity of ALT-803 in the tumor microenvironment,
we transferred Cell Trace Violet-labeled [Ovalbumin (OVA)speciﬁc] OT-I T cells into mice growing OVA-transduced syngeneic
ID8 ovarian tumors, a system that allows the recovery of tumor
microenvironment lymphocytes through peritoneal wash (17, 18,
31). After 4 days, we found that in mice treated with trametinib,
the OT-I T cells proliferated signiﬁcantly less than in mice gavaged
with vehicle (Fig. 5E and F). Importantly, when a single dose of
ALT-803 was coadministered with OT-I T cells, proliferation was
dramatically enhanced and was not restricted by trametinib (Fig.
5E and F). The observation that ALT-803 induces proliferation of
some CD44lo cells in addition to CD44hi (antigen-experienced)
OT-I T cells suggests that ALT-803 may also result in homeostatic
proliferation, as has been reported previously (32). We also found
that treatment of mice with a high-dose IL2 regimen was able to
rescue OT-I T-cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S6B and
S6C). These results indicate, ﬁrst, that trametinib impairs antigen-speciﬁc T-cell responses in vivo, although to a lesser degree
than in vitro. And second, that therapeutic activation of IL15 or IL2

2568 Cancer Res; 76(9) May 1, 2016

signaling can completely overcome trametinib-induced CD8þ Tcell suppression in the tumor microenvironment.
Combination of ALT-803 and trametinib induces rejection of
KRas-mutated tumors
To investigate the therapeutic potential of combining trametinib and ALT-803 against established KRas-mutated tumors, we
utilized a syngeneic tumor model derived from an autochthonous
breast cancer initiated in triple transgenic (L-Stop-LKRasG12Dp53ﬂx/ﬂxL-Stop-L-Myristoylated p110a) mice with adenovirus-Cre (11, 12, 15). We chose this cell line, termed breast-p53KRas-p110alpha (Brpkp110), to model treatment against tumors
that evade single-molecule targeting of the MAPK pathway
through PI3K activation, as has been commonly reported in
human cancer cells (33–35). Brpkp110 cells have detectable
signaling through MEK that can be inhibited with trametinib
(Fig. 6A) and generate aggressive tumors when grown subcutaneously in mice.
Oral gavage with trametinib signiﬁcantly reduced the growth of
Brpkp110 tumors as a single intervention (Fig. 6B), although all
mice eventually progressed to terminal disease (Fig. 6B–D). In
contrast, when ALT-803 was combined with trametinib treatment,
Brpkp110 tumors progressed even slower, with 19% of mice
remaining tumor free at 50 days, and 15% exhibiting complete
regression (Fig. 6D). No mice in either single treatment group
remained tumor free after 50 days. Most importantly, mice that
recovered from tumor challenge with trametinib/ALT-803 combination treatment developed immunologic memory against the
tumor because these mice were resistant to subsequent rechallenge with Brpkp110 cells in the opposite ﬂank over 30 days after
initial tumor rejection, whereas all na€ve control mice developed
tumors (Fig. 6E). These results indicate that a targeted-immunotherapy combination with ALT-803 and trametinib could provide
potent antitumor activity against some established and aggressive
tumors and elicit protective immunity for tumor recurrences.

Discussion
Immunotherapies are revolutionizing cancer treatments (36).
In addition, the effects of existing chemotherapy on immune cells
and the tumor microenvironment have recently become better
appreciated (37). Here we show that many small molecules used
as targeted therapies have signiﬁcant immunosuppressive effects
in vitro by interfering with signaling pathways that are critical for
priming the responses of T cells. Nevertheless, MEK inhibitorinduced suppression can be rescued by signaling from some
common gamma chain family cytokines, of which the most
effective is the IL15 agonist, ALT-803, as shown in this study.
One of the most immunosuppressive drugs ex vivo in our hands
was the FDA-approved MEK inhibitor trametinib. These data are
in agreement with previous reports identifying a strong inhibitory
activity for this drug in vitro (3, 4). However, recent studies indicate
that trametinib does not limit the effectiveness of adoptive cell
therapy in vivo (6) and synergizes with PD-1 inhibitors (7). Our
study provides a mechanistic rationale to reconcile this paradox
by demonstrating that direct T-cell inhibition by trametinib, while
still detectable in vivo in tumor-bearing hosts, can be effectively
overcome by cytokines such as IL2, IL7, and IL15. Therefore, a
combination of these cytokines endogenously in tumor-bearing
hosts may explain our observed lower suppressive effects of
trametinib in vivo as compared with in vitro. In addition, the study

IL15 Rescues T Cells from Trametinib

emerging immune therapies, through the use of T-cell–rescuing
agonists.
Our study indicates that ALT-803, an IL15 superagonist complex (30), could be the agent of choice for such a combination
therapy. ALT-803 induces memory CD8þ T cells to proliferate,
upregulate receptors for innate immunity, secrete IFNg, and
acquire the ability to kill tumor cells (30, 41, 42). Stimulation
of NK cells by ALT-803 can also contribute to enhanced antitumor
immunity. ALT-803 exhibits more potent antitumor activities
against tumors than recombinant IL15 in various animal models
(30), likely due to its much stronger binding capability to IL2Rbg
displayed on T and NK cells, longer serum half-life, and better
biologic distribution to and detainment in lymphoid tissues.
Currently, ALT-803 is in multiple clinical trials against solid and
hematologic tumors either as a single agent or in combination
with other FDA-approved immunostimulators or therapeutic
antibodies (Supplementary Table S1).
As most tumor-reactive T cells in cancer patients are unlikely to
be na€ve T cells, it is important to understand the outcome of
kinase inhibition on memory and effector T cells. Sensitivity to
MEK inhibition has been reported to correlate negatively with Tcell differentiation, suggesting that na€ve T cells require more MEK
signaling than memory and effector cells (43). We observed this
trend in one of three healthy donors, whereas two others showed
similar sensitivities between memory, effector memory, and na€ve
cells. IL15 agonists were remarkably successful at reversing the
block in proliferation by trametinib on na€ve, memory, and
effector memory T cells. In addition, murine tumor-reactive
effector T cells were inhibited by trametinib, but ALT-803 was
also able to rescue this activity.
Importantly, we found that IL15 signaling rescues MEK
inhibition-induced T-cell suppression through the activation
of the PI3K pathway. The synergy between PI3K and MEK
inhibitors on tumor cells, (44) therefore, also exists for human
T cells. These data suggest that combinatorial therapies in
patients may compromise antitumor immunity, especially
considering that combination treatment prevents the rescue
by IL15 agonists in vitro. Because treatments combining PI3K
and MEK inhibitors are being investigated clinically (39), it is
important that future studies determine whether this combination negatively impacts the antitumor activity of T cells in
tumor-bearing hosts and thus represents a poor option for
targeted-immunotherapy combination.

Overall, our ﬁndings illustrate that a greater understanding of
how targeted small molecules impact the host’s immune system
and tumor microenvironment could lead to more effective therapies against cancer and provide a novel intervention that could
pave the way for combining targeted anticancer and immune
therapies.
