Abstract

Author Manuscript

The incidence of many cancer types is significantly reduced in individuals with Down
syndrome1–4 and it is proposed that this broad cancer protection is conferred by the elevated
expression of one or more of the 231 supernumerary genes on the extra copy of chromosome 21.
One such gene is the Down syndrome candidate region-1 (Dscr1, RCAN1), which encodes a
protein that suppresses vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated angiogenic signalling
via the calcineurin pathway5–10. Here we show that DSCR1 is elevated in Down syndrome
individuals and a mouse model of Down syndrome. Further, we show that the modest elevation in

expression afforded by a single extra transgenic copy of Dscr1 is sufficient to confer significant
suppression of tumor growth in mice and that such resistance is a consequence of a deficit in
tumor angiogenesis arising from suppression of the calcineurin pathway. We also provide
evidence that attenuation of calcineurin activity by DSCR1 together with another chromosome 21
gene DYRK1A, may be sufficient to dramatically diminish angiogenesis. These data provide a
mechanism for the reduced cancer incidence in Down syndrome and identifies the calcineurin
signalling pathway and its regulators DSCR1 and DYRK1A as potential therapeutic targets in
cancers arising in all individuals.

Down syndrome (DS), is the most common genetic cause of mental retardation in humans
occurring in 1 out of 700 live births. Epidemiological studies suggest that while individuals
with DS have increased risk of leukemia, they have a considerably reduced incidence of
most solid tumors1–4. In the largest study to date involving 17,800 DS individuals, the
mortality from cancers was <10% of expected4. Such data imply that one or more of the 231
trisomic genes on chromosome 21 is responsible for protecting these individuals against
cancer. Of note, DS individuals also exhibit a reduced incidence of other angiogenesisrelated diseases such as diabetic retinopathy11 and atherosclerosis12, suggesting that cancer
protection in the DS population may be due in part, to angiogenesis suppression.

The Dscr1 gene lies on chromosome 21 and encodes a negative regulator of VEGFcalcineurin signalling in the endothelium5–10. Previous studies have demonstrated that
gross over-expression of DSCR1 in endothelial cells blocks VEGF-mediated angiogenic
responses in vitro7–10. We examined DSCR1 protein expression in DS human fetal tissues
and observed a consistent 1.8-fold increase in DSCR1 levels in tissues from DS embryos, as
well as elevated expression of DSCR1 fetal isoforms5, compared with those from agematched non-DS fetuses (Fig. 1A). Substantial synteny exists in gene identity and order
between much of human chromosome 21 and the mouse13. The Ts65Dn mouse model of
DS is trisomic for 104 of the 231 genes on human chromosome 21 including DSCR114
(Supplemental Fig. 1A). We probed tissues from Ts65Dn mice to ascertain whether DSCR1
was also upregulated in the Ts65Dn mouse and found a 1.7-fold increase in DSCR1 protein
expression compared with diploid littermates (Supplemental Fig. 1B). Thus, DSCR1
expression in Ts65Dn mice is elevated in an analogous fashion to DSCR1 expression in DS
fetal tissues.

We hypothesized that inhibition of tumorigenesis in the DS population may be partially due
to suppression of tumor angiogenesis, thus predicting that the inhibitory effect of Dscr1
trisomy on tumor growth occurs within the host tumor microenvironment. To establish
whether the Ts65Dn DS mouse, like DS individuals, exhibits generalized protection from
cancers, we assayed the growth of two transplantable tumor models – Lewis lung carcinoma
and B16F10 melanoma cells. We observed considerable growth suppression of both Lewis
lung and B16F10 tumor cells in Ts65Dn mice relative to littermate controls (Fig. 1B),
correlating with a significant decrease in microvessel density (Fig. 1C). Endothelial cells
isolated from Ts65Dn mice demonstrated upregulation of Dscr1 mRNA in contrast to
diploid littermates (Supplemental Fig. 1C) and were noticeably less responsive to VEGFmediated proliferation in vitro (Supplemental Fig. 1D), further implicating an angiogenic

defect in these mice. Thus, trisomy for orthologs of half the genes on human chromosome
21 was sufficient to slow ectopic tumor growth.
To validate that the compromised angiogenesis we observed in murine models of DS
extended to human cells carrying trisomy 21, we compared microvessel density in teratomas
derived from DS induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells versus those from cytogenetically
normal iPS cells from a healthy volunteer15. These iPS cell lines were inoculated
intramuscularly into immunodeficient mice (Rag2−/−γc−/−), and angiogenesis assessed in the
resulting tumors using a human-specific antibody to the endothelial marker CD3116.
Microvessel density was significantly reduced in teratomas derived from Down syndrome
iPS cells compared to iPS cells from the normal control (Fig. 1D and Supplemental Fig. 1E).

Given that Ts65Dn mice are trisomic for 104 genes, we next determined whether 3 copies of
only Dscr1 would be sufficient to suppress tumorigenesis. We generated a Dscr1 transgenic
mouse targeting a myc-tagged Dscr1 cDNA driven by its native promoter to the Hprt locus
(Supplemental Fig. 2A, B). Expression of the targeted third copy of Dscr1 was verified by
Western blot analysis on isolated endothelial cells (Supplemental Fig. 2C) and quantitative
PCR analysis demonstrated a 2.4-fold increase in Dscr1 mRNA relative to littermate
controls (Supplemental Fig. 2D). To ensure that one extra copy of Dscr1 was sufficient to
restrain VEGF-calcineurin signalling, we examined NF-ATc1 subcellular localization as a
measure of calcineurin activation (Fig. 2A). After VEGF treatment, endothelial cells isolated
from Dscr1 transgenic mice exhibited predominantly cytoplasmic NF-ATc1 localization
while wild-type endothelial cells displayed the expected nuclear localization (Fig. 2A).
Dscr1 transgenic endothelial cells also exhibited decreased sensitivity to VEGF relative to
wild-type endothelial cells, as assessed by VEGF-induced proliferation (Fig. 2B).

Substantial growth inhibition of Lewis lung carcinoma and B16F10 melanoma cells was
observed in Dscr1 transgenic mice (Fig. 2C) with a corresponding decrease in microvessel
density (Fig. 2D) as compared with tumors from wild-type littermates. Quantification of
endothelial cells in tumors isolated from Dscr1 transgenic and wild-type mice by flow
cytometry showed a significant decrease in CD31+CD45− cells in tumors from Dscr1
transgenic mice (Supplemental Fig. 3A). Additionally, many of the CD31 reactive
microvessels in tumors isolated from Dscr1 transgenic mice lacked functional lumens as
evidenced by the absence of co-staining with circulating FITC-lectin and CD31-positivity
(Supplemental Fig. 3B). Immunostaining with CD31 and Myc antibodies confirmed specific
expression of the DSCR1 transgene in tumor endothelium of Dscr1 transgenic animals (Fig.
2E). Thus, a single extra copy of Dscr1 appears to be sufficient to blunt host angiogenic
responses and suppress tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth. A subset of tumors initiate
growth by coopting existing host vessels17 but the progressive growth and elaboration of
new vessels accompanying tumor expansion requires neoangiogenesis. To ascertain whether
excess DSCR1 suppresses initial vessel cooption or subsequent angiogenesis, Dscr1
transgenic and wild-type mice were inoculated with reduced numbers of Lewis lung
carcinoma cells to generate slowly growing tumors. DSCR1 elevation inhibited the extended
growth phase of transplanted tumors and not just their initial expansion (Supplemental Fig.
3C), supporting the notion that excess DSCR1 suppresses tumor angiogenesis.

To confirm that tumor protection in the Ts65Dn mouse was specifically due to Dscr1
trisomy, we crossed the Ts65Dn mice to Dscr1+/− mice18 generating Ts65Dn/Dscr1+/−
animals with 2 copies of Dscr1 but maintaining trisomy for the other 103 genes (Fig. 3A).
After validating both segmental trisomy and Dscr1 status (Supplemental Fig. 4A and B), we
compared flank tumor growth in diploid mice to that in Ts65Dn mice with 2 or 3 copies of
Dscr1. Reduction to 2 Dscr1 copies in Ts65Dn/Dscr1+/− mice significantly abrogated the
tumor protection observed in Ts65Dn parental mice (Fig. 3B). Loss of the protective effect
against tumor growth was mirrored by a corresponding increase in microvessel density in
tumors from Ts65Dn/ Dscr1+/− mice relative to their Ts65Dn littermates (Fig. 3C),
confirming the pivotal role played by Dscr1 in tumor suppression in the Ts65Dn DS mouse
model. Together, our data provide strong support for the notion that 1 extra copy of Dscr1 is
necessary for maximal suppression of tumor growth via inhibition of tumor angiogenesis.

Increased dosage of Dscr1 might suppress angiogenesis by down-regulating expression of
calcineurin-NFAT-dependent targets in endothelial cells. Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) has
been identified as a calcineurin-dependent gene and an important mediator of the angiogenic
response to VEGF19. Quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis of COX-2 expression in
Dscr1 transgenic endothelial cells demonstrated a substantial decrease in COX-2 levels
relative to control littermates (Fig. 4A, B) suggesting that a modest increase in DSCR1
expression suppresses expression of COX-2 and likely other VEGF-responsive targets.
While Dscr1 trisomy plays a significant role in preventing tumor angiogenesis in our DS
mouse model, there are clearly other chromosome 21 genes that contribute to the tumor
suppressive effects observed in the Ts65Dn mouse. Since increased dosage of Dscr1
attenuates VEGF-calcineurin-NFAT signalling, we examined the role of Dyrk1A, another
chromosome 21 gene known to regulate NFAT signalling and contribute to other Down
syndrome phenotypes20, 21. After confirmation of Dyrk1A expression in endothelial cells
(Supplemental Fig. 4C), we examined the effects of Dyrk1A upregulation with Dscr1
trisomy after over-expression of Dyrk1A into Dscr1 transgenic endothelial cells (Fig 4C).
VEGF-mediated endothelial proliferation was dramatically inhibited as a consequence of
increased expression of both DYRK1A and DSCR1 (Fig. 4D) implying that upregulation of
Dyrk1A may contribute to the remaining tumor suppression observed in the Ts65DnDscr1+/− mouse with 2 copies of Dscr1. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the modest
excess of DSCR1 afforded by a single extra copy, impedes VEGF-calcineurin signalling in
endothelial cells. The consequent suppression of tumor angiogenesis and, ultimately, tumor
growth provides a mechanistic basis for the remarkable protection from solid tumors
observed in DS individuals. Of note, host Dscr1 copy number influences the growth and
vascularization of allografted tumor cell lines confirming the cell intrinsic tumor suppressive
effect of Dscr1 dosage by modulating angiogenesis within the host tumor
microenvironment.
Since human chromosome 21 harbors over 200 genes, it would be surprising if Dscr1 were
the only chromosome 21 gene implicated in tumor suppression in DS individuals. Indeed
our data suggests that increased dosage of Dyrk1A, appears to act in concert with Dscr1 to
suppress tumor angiogenesis by further attenuating VEGF-calcineurin-NFAT signalling in
endothelial cells. By disrupting the balance of NFAT phosphorylation, DYRK1A blocks

transactivation of NFAT-dependent target genes20, 21. Other trisomy 21 genes may inhibit
tumor development via cancer cell autonomous mechanisms. A recent study using the
Ts65Dn mouse on the APCmin mice background demonstrated that 3 copies of the Ets2
proto-oncogene reduced the incidence of spontaneous intestinal tumors22. However,
examination of a spontaneous tumor model prevents the distinction of Ets2 dosage effects on
tumor initiation versus progression. In contrast, our work specifically investigates
suppression of tumor progression as a consequence of Dscr1 trisomy. Additional studies are
necessary to determine the magnitude and synergy of these genes in suppressing tumor
growth in both the Ts65Dn mouse and the DS population.

Author Manuscript

Our studies implicate DSCR1-dependent inhibition of the VEGF-calcineurin-NFAT
pathway in endothelial cells as a key component of the reduced cancer incidence in DS
individuals. Hence, it is reasonable to speculate that cyclosporin A and FK506,
immunosuppressive drugs that specifically inhibit calcineurin23, would also suppress tumor
angiogenesis. Surprisingly, numerous clinical studies indicate that a significant increase in
cancer incidence is a serious complication of transplant recipients receiving long-term
immunosupressive therapy24. The mechanism behind this increased rate of cancer is not yet
understood, however, such studies point to an important distinction between the calcineurininhibitory action of DSCR1 and those of cyclosporin A and FK506.

The cancer protection observed in DS individuals is remarkable given the heterogeneous
mechanisms utilized amongst tumors. While DS individuals have less exposure to
environmental and other factors that contribute to tumor incidence, the implication remains
that one or more of the trisomic genes on chromosome 21 exert an anti-neoplastic effect,
presumably by modulating some fundamental aspect of tumor initiation and/or progression.
Microscopic avascular tumors represent the earliest stages of human neoplasias and are
commonly observed in many organs upon autopsy25. This data suggests that progression
into macroscopic tumors, not tumor initiation, may be rate limiting in human cancers. Such
progression is critically dependent upon interactions between the incipient tumor and its
microenvironment – most notably, activation of the “angiogenic switch”. The pivotal role
played by DSCR1 in tumor angiogenesis makes it a compelling candidate for cancer
protection in the DS population. Our data implicates VEGF-calcineurin-NFAT as a critical
signalling axis in endothelial cells and that maximal suppression of calcineurin requires
increased expression of both Dscr1 and Dyrk1A. Additional studies will be required to
explore whether angiogenesis in general may also be impaired in the Ts65Dn mouse and in
DS individuals. Finally, our studies in the Ts65Dn mouse and transgenic tri-allelic Dscr1
mouse demonstrate the in vivo relevance of a modest excess of Dscr1 arising from trisomy is
sufficient to negatively regulate tumor growth by dampening VEGF-calcineurin signalling.
By analogy, we conclude that elevated expression of Dscr1 in individuals with trisomy 21 is
likely a significant contributor to the decreased cancer incidence in this population. It is
perhaps, inspiring that the Down syndrome population provides us with novel insight into
mechanisms that regulate cancer growth and, by so doing, identify potential targets for
tumor prevention and therapy.

Figure 2. Targeted Dscr1 transgenic mice with three copies of Dscr1 show inhibition of tumor
growth

(a) NF-ATc1 nuclear import after VEGF treatment is suppressed in endothelial cells from
Dscr1 transgenic mice. Bar, 5 µM. (b) VEGF-induced proliferation of endothelial cells from
Dscr1 transgenic mice is significantly inhibited. *p<0.02; **p<0.03. (c) Tumor growth is
suppressed in Dscr1 transgenic mice. n=8–12 mice per group, *p<0.05; **p<0.04. (d)

Figure 3. Trisomic expression of Dscr1 is necessary for significant suppression of tumor growth
in the Ts65Dn Down syndrome mouse model

(a) Possible genotypes arising from mating Ts65Dn and Dscr1+/− mice. (b) Suppression of
B16F10 tumor growth in Ts65Dn Down syndrome mice is relieved upon loss of the third
copy of Dscr1 (Ts65Dn-Dscr1+/−). Values are mean± sem, n=4–8 per group, *p<0.01. (c)
Microvessel density (MVD) per high-powered field (hpf) is quantified by anti-CD31
immunofluorescence of tumors harvested from the indicated mice at comparable volumes
(200–400 mm3). Bar, 20 µM. Values are mean ± sem.

Figure 4. Calcineurin suppression by DSCR1 and DYRK1A attenuates endothelial cell activation

(a, b) Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA (a) and protein expression (b) was quantified by
qPCR and Western blot analysis in endothelial cells isolated from Dscr1 wild-type (WT)
and transgenic (Tg) mice. (c) Western blot analysis of endothelial cells isolated from Dscr
transgenic mice and probed for DYRK1A after either mock infection (mock) or retroviral
infection with Dyrk1A (DYRK1A). (d) Endothelial cells isolated from Dscr1 transgenic
(Tg) mice with DYRK1A over-expression (+DYRK1A) demonstrate an even greater
suppression of VEGF-mediated proliferation as compared to wild-type (WT) and DSCR1
over-expression alone (mock). Values are mean ± sem, *p<0.01.
