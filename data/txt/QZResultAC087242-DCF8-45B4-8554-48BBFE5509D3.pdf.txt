ABSTRACT
Patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) are often diagnosed
with advanced diseases that respond poorly to chemotherapy. Here we reported that
Apollon, a membrane-associated inhibitor of apoptosis protein, was overexpressed
in ESCC cell lines and clinical ESCC tissues, and Apollon overexpression clinically
correlated with poor response to chemotherapy (P = 0.001), and short overall survival
(P = 0.021). Apollon knockdown increased cisplatin/docetaxel-induced apoptosis,
mitochondrial dysfunction and cytochrome c release in two ESCC cell lines. Apollon
knockdown potentiated cisplatin/docetaxel-induced long-term cell growth inhibition,
and enhanced chemosensitivity of ESCC cells to cisplatin/docetaxel in xenograft tumor
models. Apollon knockdown also enhanced cisplatin/docetaxel-induced activation
of caspase-8 (extrinsic pathway) and caspase-9 (intrinsic pathway) in ESCC cells
and xenograft tumor models. Mechanism studies revealed that the effect of Apollon
on chemosensitivity is mainly mediated by Smac. Apollon expression strongly and
negatively correlated with Smac expression in clinical ESCC tissues (P = 0.001).
Apollon targeted Smac for degradation in ESCC cells. The effect of Apollon on
chemosensitivity was reversed by Smac knockdown in ESCC cells. Taken together, our
data show association of Apollon expression with chemotherapeutic response in ESCC,
and provide a strong rationale for combining Apollon antagonism with chemotherapy
to treat ESCC.

INTRODUCTION

30% [2, 3]. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC),
the major histological subtype of esophageal cancer,
accounting for more than 90% of the total esophageal
cancer occurrence globally, is often diagnosed with
advanced diseases that respond poorly to chemotherapy
and radiation therapy. Concurrent chemo/radiotherapy
is currently regarded as the most effective treatment for
advanced esophageal cancer. Cisplatin and docetaxel are

Esophageal cancer is the eighth most common
incident cancer and the sixth most common cause of
cancer-related death worldwide [1]. The presence of
lymph node metastasis and vascular invasion as well as
distant organ involvement leads to a poor clinical outcome
and the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate is only 20% to

used as monotherapy or in combination with other agents
to treat ESCC clinically, but their activities are far from
satisfactory [4, 5]. Therefore, identifying and targeting
genes conducive to the treatment of ESCC, such as
enhancement of conventional chemotherapy, is necessary
to improve the survival of patients with this type of
refractory cancer.
Induction of apoptosis is the main molecular
mechanism of chemo- and radiotherapy to kill cancer
cells [6]. Resistance to apoptosis is a common feature
whereby tumor cells escape from chemotherapy-induced
cytotoxicity, thus leading to chemoresistance. Apoptosis
inhibitory genes with certain activity in human cancers
function to promote carcinogenesis and tumor progression,
including the ability to allow tumor cells to escape druginduced apoptosis. The inhibitor of apoptosis proteins
(IAPs) are crucial components of these processes because
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of their functional importance in the regulation of cell
death [7]. IAPs play a role in apoptosis resistance in
a variety of cancer cell lines and are characterized by
a novel domain of 70 amino acids termed baculovirus
inhibition of apoptosis protein repeat (BIR) [8, 9]. IAPs
bind to and inhibit various pro-apoptotic factors, thereby
effectively suppressing apoptosis induced by a broad range
of effectors, including chemotherapeutics and irradiation.
The aberrant high expression of IAPs in cancer cells, with
little expression in most normal tissues, makes IAPs an
attractive anticancer target [10].
Apollon, also called baculoviral IAP repeat
containing 6 (BIRC6), is a unique member of the IAP
family. It is a giant memberane-associated protein with
4830 amino acid residues with a N-terminal single BIR
domain and a C-terminal ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC)
enzyme domain [11]. Apollon can form a thioester with

ubiquitin and transfer ubiquitin to substrate proteins,
demonstrating that it functions as a chimeric E2/E3
ubiquitin ligase [12]. Ample evidence has indicated that
Apollon is abnormally over-expressed in some kinds
of malignant tumors including brain cancer, breast
cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer and childhood acute
leukemia [13-17]. Importantly, excessive expression
of Apollon is significantly correlated with unfavorable
clinical features at diagnosis, pathological grading of
tumor, high cellular proliferation, and poor prognosis in
acute myeloid leukemia and lung cancer [16-17].
Although the expression of several IAPs in ESCC
and their role in chemoresistance have been previously
investigated [18-21], the expression and role of Apollon
in ESCC, however, remains unclear. In the present work,
we studied the expression pattern of Apollon in ESCC
cell lines and clinical ESCC tissues. In addition, we

evaluated the association between Apollon expression
and chemotherapy response in ESCC patients. We also
investigated the molecular mechanisms by which Apollon
regulates chemosensitivity in ESCC cells.

RESULTS
Apollon overexpression correlated with Smac
downregulation in ESCC patients
We first determined the level of Apollon protein
in 13 ESCC cell lines. Western blotting showed that
Apollon protein was highly expressed in Eca109, TE-4,
TE-5, TE-8, TE-10, TE-11, EC8712, KYSE30, KYSE150,
KYSE180, KYSE510 and EC9760, whereas it was weakly

detected in TE-1 and normal esophageal epithelial cells
(NEECs) (Fig. 1A, upper panel and 1B). Recently, Hao
et al. [22] reported that the second mitochondria-derived
activator of caspase (Smac) was downregulated by
Apollon in human 293T embryonic kidney cells. However,
a contradictory conclusion was drawn by Ren et al. [23],
who reported that the amount of Smac was not altered
by Apollon in human H460 lung nonsmall carcinoma
cell. Therefore the effect of Apollon on Smac appears
to vary according to tissue types. To investigate whether
Apollon regulates Smac in ESCC cells, we measured the
level of Smac in 13 ESCC cell lines. In contrast to the
increase of Apollon, Smac expression is decreased in all
ESCC cell lines studied (Fig. 1A, middle panel and C).
In addition, using Western blotting, we demonstrated
the overexpression of Apollon (Fig. 1D, upper panel and
1E) and downregulation of Smac (Fig. 1D, middle panel

and F) in the tumor tissues from 30 patients with ESCC.
Moreover, Apollon expression negatively correlated with
Smac expression (R = -0.463, P = 0.009) (Supplementary
Figure 1).
To further evaluate the role of Apollon in human
ESCC, we next examined Apollon expression in tissues
from 111 patients with ESCC using immunohistochemistry
(IHC) staining. Positive signals of Apollon mainly
localized in the cytoplasm. High staining of Apollon
could be observed in 62 of 111 (55.8%) cases of ESCCs,
whereas in only 12 of 111 (10.8%) cases of adjacent
non-tumor tissues. The Apollon scores in tumor tissues
were 2.4-fold higher than those in adjacent non-tumor
tissues (Fig. 2A and B). Considering the possible
relationship between Apollon and Smac, Smac was
also stained in the same series of patients. In contrast
to Apollon, the Smac scores were 1.8-fold lower in

ESCC tumor tissues than in adjacent non-tumor tissues
(Fig. 2A and C). Notably, Apollon expression strongly
and negatively correlated with Smac expression (R =
-0.416, P = 0.001) (Fig. 2D). We further investigated the
correlation of Apollon expression with clinicopathologic
features. Clinical characteristics of patients are listed
in Supplementary Table 1. Clinicopathologic analysis
showed that Apollon expression failed to correlate to
the clinical pathological factors including TNM stage
and tumor differentiation (Supplementary Table 2). To
give a comprehensive evaluation of IAPs expression
in human ESCC, we detected other members of IAPs
by IHC staining in 111 patients with ESCC. We found
that c-IAP1 (Birc2), XIAP (Birc4), Survivin (Birc5)
and Livin (Birc7) were overexpressed in ESCC tissues,
while NAIP (Birc1) and  c-IAP2 (Birc3) were comparable
between tumor tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues
(Supplementary Fig. 2).

To study whether there is a relationship between
Apollon expression and chemotherapeutic response
in ESCC patients, we analyzed another cohort of 70
ESCC patients who had undergone cisplatin-based
chemotherapy. Clinical characteristics of patients are
listed in Supplementary Table 3. With regard to the
clinical response, chemotherapy-sensitive with complete
response (CR)/partial response (PR) was achieved in
25 patients, whereas chemotherapy-resistant with stable
disease (SD)/progressive disease (PD) was observed in 45
patients. High staining of Apollon in tumor tissues could
be observed in 9 (36%) patients of CR/PR group, but
in 35 (77.8%) of SD/PD group. Interestingly, we found
that the expression of Apollon in tumor tissues inversely
and significantly correlated with the clinical response

was 1.9-fold as high as that in CR/PR groups (Fig. 3C).

to cisplatin/docetaxel remains a major problem in the
treatment of ESCC patients. To investigate the role of
Apollon in chmosensitivity of ESCC cells to cisplatin/
docetaxel, we used shRNA to knock down Apollon
expression in KYSE510 and Eca109 cells. The effect
of Apollon knockdown was confirmed with Western
blotting (Supplementary Fig. 3). Apollon knockdown

parallel experiments were conducted in which the co-IP
antibody was replaced with an isotype-matched control
antibody or PBS. Moreover, we observed the interaction
between Apollon and Smac in KYSE510 cells (data not
shown). We next determined the localization of these two
proteins in KYSE510 cells with immunofluorescence
analysis. Co-localization of Apollon and Smac in
cytoplasm was shown by overlapping fluorescent signals
(Fig. 5B). To investigate the effect of Apollon on Smac,
we examined the Smac levels in Apollon knockdown
KYSE510 cells. We found that Smac protein level was
dramatically upregulated, whereas Smac mRNA level
was not affected, by Apollon knockdown (Fig. 5C). In
contrast, the level of ubiquitinated Smac was reduced by
Apollon knockdown in KYSE510 cells (Fig. 5D). Smac

DISCUSSION

pathway. Therefore, we measured Smac degradation in
Apollon knockdown KYSE510 cells. Cells were treated
with a protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide for the
indicated period of time before harvesting. Levels of Smac
were markedly decreased in control cells but remained
relatively high in Apollon knockdown cells over time (Fig.
5E).
To better understand the mechanism underlying
Apollon
knockdown-mediated
enhancement
of
chemosensitivity, we performed Western blotting to
investigate apoptotic signaling. Our data showed that
Apollon knockdown potentiated cisplatin-induced Smac
release, along with cytochrome c release, caspase-9 and
caspase-8 activation in KYSE510 cells. These effects were
reversed by shRNA-mediated Smac knockdown (Fig. 5F).
Consistent with Western blotting analysis, Annexin V/PI
staining and Mito Tracker Red staining demonstrated that
Apollon knockdown potentiated cisplatin- or docetaxelinduced apoptotic events, which were reversed by Smac
knockdown (Supplementary Fig. 5A and B). Consistently,
Smac knockdown reversed the facilitated effects of
Apollon knockdown on cisplatin- or docetaxel-induced
long-term cell growth suppression in KYSE510 and
Eca109 cells (Supplementary Fig. 5C)

This study was done to investigate the possible role
of Apollon in ESCC chemosensitivity for the first time.
Western blotting and immunohistochemistry demonstrated
Apollon overexpression in ESCC cell lines and clinical
ESCC tissues. Although we failed to find any correlation
between Apollon expression and stage or grade for
ESCC, we did find that high expression of Apollon was
closely associated with poor response to chemotherapy in
patients who had undergone cisplatin-based chemotherapy.
Clinical pathological factors including TNM stage
and tumor differentiation usually have great impact in
deterring the response to chemotherapy. Meanwhile,
clinical pathological factors may not be the only elements
that  influence sensitivity to chemotherapy. Abnormal
protein expression and disordered signaling pathway,
which impede apoptosis, can also lead to the resistance
to chemotherapy. Recently, an attempt has been made to
identify the genomic alterations in human ESCC, which
reveals that somatic aberrations are mainly involved in
cell survival and apoptosis pathways [26]. In the present
study, we found that Apollon knockdown alone is unable
to alter tumor growth in xenograft tumor model, which
was consistent with our finding that Apollon expression
did not correlate with the stage and grade of ESCC.
Nevertheless, Apollon, as a unique member of IAPs,
altered the apoptotic threshold of ESCC cells in vitro and
in vivo in our study. Moreover, high expression of Apollon
was associated with short overall survival in patients
undergone cisplatin-based chemotherapy. These data
suggest a previously unrecognized role of Apollon in the
intrinsic resistance of esophageal cancer to chemotherapy.
RNA interference has become conventional
applications for in vivo cancer therapy, and an efficient
way of delivering small interfering RNA into solid tumors
has been developed [27]. Using RNA interference, we
found that Apollon knockdown significantly potentiated
cisplatin or doxetacel-induced apoptosis, mitochondrial
membrane potential collapse, cytochrome c release,
caspase activation, and long-term cell growth suppression,
hence sensitizing esophageal cancer to cisplatin or
doxetacel treatment in vitro and in vivo. This critical role
of Apollon in chemotherapy-induced apoptosis is also
supported by previous studies on Apollon using other
agents and different cell types [28, 29]. Apoptosis is one of
the main contributors, although certainly not the only one,
to the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapeutic drugs. Indeed,
proteins that control the apoptotic process hold great
promise as drug targets for various tumor types. In the
present study, aberrant Apollon expression in ESCC may
confer chemoresistance by altering the balance between
pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins. Apollon knockdown may
have the potential to restore chemosensitivity in resistant
cells.
We further observed that Smac appeared to be

Apollon modulated chemosensitivity to cisplatin
and docetaxel in vivo
To determine whether Apollon knockdown increases
chemosensitivity in vivo, shC and sh1 KYSE510 cells
were injected subcutaneously into flanks of nude
mice. After the tumor volume reached 50 to 90 mm3,
tumorbearing mice were treated with cisplatin (4 mg/kg;
i.p., twice weekly) or docetaxel (7.0 mg/kg; i.p., thrice
weekly) as described previously with modifications [24,
25]. The antitumor efficacy was measured by monitoring
the tumor volume after treatment. The average tumor
volume was slightly decreased in Apollon knockdown
cells compared to control cells, but the difference did not
reach statistical  significance (Fig. 6Ai). Following the
treatment with cisplatin (docetaxel), the average tumor
volume of control cells and Apollon knockdown cells
was 400.2 ± 20.6 mm3 (248.2 ± 26.69 mm3) and 219.7 ±
16.6 mm3 (129.2 ± 12.5 mm3), respectively (Fig. 6Aii and
Aiii). Apollon knockdown resulted in 45.1% and 47.9%
inhibition of tumor growth in cisplatin and docetaxeltreated mice, respectively. Apollon knockdown enhanced
cisplatin- or doxetacel- induced apoptosis in tumor cells in
vivo, as shown by TUNEL assay (Fig. 6B and C). Apollon
knockdown also increased cisplatin- or doxetacel- induced
caspase-9 and caspase-8 activation in vivo, as assessed by
IHC staining (Fig. 6D and E). Finally, Apollon knockdown
increased Smac expression in vivo (Fig. 6F).

dispensable for the activity of Apollon on chemosensitivity
in ESCC cells. So far, the association between Apollon
and Smac is not well understood and inconsistent results
have been reported. Hao et al. [22] reported that Apollon
facilitated Smac degradation in human 293T embryonic
kidney cells in vitro, whereas Ren et al. [23] reported that
Apollon did not promote Smac degradation in human
H460 lung nonsmall carcinoma cell in vitro. Both Hao
and Ren [22, 23] reported that Apollon deletion did not
affect Smac protein levels in Apollon deficient mice
in vivo. However, Qiu et al. [30] reported that Apollon
affect Smac protein levels in wild-type mice tissues in
vivo. Other researchers [31, 32] reported that Apollon
may also regulate Smac mRNA levels. Based on these
results, we proposed that effect of Apollon on Smac may
vary according to species and tissue types. In the present
studies, we found that Apollon was overexpressed,
while Smac was downregulated, in ESCC cells and
tissues. Apollon overexpression strongly correlated with
Smac downregulation in clinical ESCC tissues. Apollon
knockdown increased Smac protein level, while had no
effect on Smac mRNA level in ESCC cells. Apollon
interacted with Smac in clinical ESCC tissues. Moreover,
Apollon ubiquitinated Smac, consequently facilitated its
proteasomal degradation in ESCC cells. Most importantly,
Smac knockdown reversed the sensitization effect of
Apollon knockdown on ESCC cells to chemotherapy.
Taken together, these data underscore an important role of
Smac in Apollon mediated chemoresistance. This role was
supported by previous studies by Xu et al., who reported
that downregulation of Smac may be a chemoresistance
mechanism in ESCC cells [25].
Smac [known as DIABLO (direct IAP binding
protein with low pI) in mouse], is a recently identified
mitochondrial protein. Upon chemo treatment, Smac
is released along with cytochrome c and promotes
cytochrome c-dependent caspase activation by neutralizing
inhibitor of apoptosis proteins. A growing number of
studies have reported the association between IAPs and
Smac. Cytoprotective IAPs, ML-IAP (melanoma IAP) and
ILP-2 (IAP-like protein 2), exert their antiapoptotic effects
through the neutralization of Smac [33, 34]. C-IAP1 and
c-IAP2 stimulate Smac degradation as E3 ubiquitin ligases
both in vivo and in vitro [35]. XIAP interacts and retains
Smac inside mitochondria that already underwent MOMP
(mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization) [36].
In our studies, apollon appears to play an important role
in cytoprotection against Smac, which contributes to the
chemoresistance in ESCC.
A surprising finding was that apollon knockdown
enhanced activation of both caspase 9 and caspase 8 in
cisplatin/docitaxel treated ESCC cells in vitro and in
vivo. Caspase 9 and caspase 8 have been recognized as
the initiator caspases of intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis
pathways, respectively [37]. We, hence, proposed that
Apollon may regulate chemosensitivity via multifaceted
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mechanism involving both intrinsic mitochondrial and
extrinsic death receptor pathway. Although Apollon
and Smac typically regulated apoptosis through the
mitochondrial intrinsic pathway [14, 23, 25], recently
Probst et al. [38] reported that Smac mimetics increased
cancer cell response to chemotherapeutics through a
TNF-a/RIP1-dependent extrinsic apoptotic pathway.
We proposed that Apollon knockdown may promote
cytochrome c-dependent caspase-9 activation and TNF-a/
RIP1-dependent caspase-8 activation through Smac
stabilization. Nonetheless, the underlying mechanism
regarding the role of Apollon in intrinsic and extrinsic
apoptosis pathways may need further investigation.
IAP antagonists have attracted increasing interest
in triggering cancer cell death and are currently at the
preclinical development stage or early clinical testing [39].
So far, six molecules targeting IAPs, including LCL-161,
AT-406, HSG1029, TL32711, GDC-0152, CUDC-427,
have entered clinical trials with early results showing no
dose limiting toxicities, suggesting that IAP proteins can
be targeted by small molecules [40]. Although a specific
peptide or peptidomimetic against Apollon has not yet
been developed, studies on protein–protein interaction
domain and phase display have successfully developed
inhibitors against XIAP, c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 [39]. Similar
methods can be used to develop a specific antagonist of
Apollon.
The present study has certain limitations. First, the
clinical results were based on retrospective analysis by
using tissue specimens obtained from patients who had
undergone cisplatin-based chemotherapy at only one
institution. Second, the current results showed that Apollon
mainly modulated the chemosensitivity in esophageal
cancer through regulation of Smac. However, we cannot
exclude the possibility that Smac is an important but
not exclusive mediator of the chemoresistant effects of
Apollon, because Apollon was reported to function as
an E2/E3 ubiquitin ligase to ubiquitinate other apoptosis
effector [12, 14, 22, 23]. Third, the present study was
carried out in certain cell lines. Considering that most
cancer tumors are highly heterogeneous, we need to
validate our findings in other ESCC cell lines.
In conclusion, our results show association of
Apollon overexpression with chemotherapeutic response.
These results suggest that combinations of conventional
anticancer drugs with Apollon-targeted therapy may
be beneficial for the treatment of esophageal cancer.
Further studies of Apollon antagonist and other apoptosis
regulators may help develop novel therapeutic strategies
for esophageal cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Antibodies
against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) (#sc-47724) were from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against NAIP
(#ab25968), XIAP (#ab28151), c-IAP1 (#ab108361),
c-IAP2 (#ab137393) were from Abcam (Cambridge,
MA). Secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence were
TRITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG and Alexafluor
488–conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, from Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA).

Patients’ samples
For Apollon and Smac expression studies, Tumor
specimens were obtained from 111 consecutive male
patients with ESCC who have undergone curative
resection in Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University
between 2007 and 2008. Patient clinical parameters were
summarized in Supplementary Table 1. The inclusion
and exclusion criteria have been reported [41]. Briefly:
(a) having a distinctive pathologic diagnosis of ESCC,
(b) having no anticancer treatment before esophageal
resection, (c) having curative esophageal resection, and
(d) having suitable formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded
tissues. Curative resection was defined as complete
resection of all tumor nodules and the cut surface being
free of cancer by histologic examination. Each specimen
has a corresponding nontumorous tissue 3 cm away from
the tumor. ESCC diagnosis was based on the World Health
Organization (WHO) criteria. Tumor differentiation
and staging was defined according to the 7th edition of
tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification of Union
Internationale Contra Cancrum (UICC).
For 70 response cases of chemotherapy (70 male),
included CR/PR and SD/PD, tumor specimens were
obtained from the third affiliated hospital, Nanchang
University between January, 2005 and December,
2008. Patient clinical parameters were summarized in
Supplementary Table 2. All patients were diagnosed
as ESCC histopathologically and subjected to
surgical esophagectomy, followed by cisplatin-based
chemotherapy for postoperative recurrence. Cisplatin was
given by continuous intravenous administration at a dose
of 60 to 100 mg/m2 for 4 to 5 days, and in combination
of paclitaxel, 5-FU, or gemcitabine [42]. The effect of
chemotherapeutic response was evaluated clinically
according to WHO criteria. The diagnostic examinations
consisted of esophagography, computed tomography, chest
X-ray, abdominal ultrasonography, and bone scan. The
subjects were followed-up every 3-4 months during the
first postoperative year and at least 6 months afterward for
survival and recurrence inquiry until death, contact failure,
or until the end of the investigation, i.e., January 10, 2012,
with the median follow-up was 30 months (range 1–48
months).

Cell lines, culture conditions
Primary cultures of normal esophageal epithelial
cells (NEEC) were established from fresh specimens of
the adjacent noncancerous esophageal tissue, which is
over 5 cm from the cancerous tissue, according to previous
report [43]. Human ESCC cell lines Eca109, TE-1, TE10, TE-11, EC8712 and EC9706 were obtained from Cell
Bank of Type Culture Collection of Chinese Academy
of Sciences (Shanghai, China). TE-4, TE-5, TE-8 were
obtained from RIKEN Bioresource Center. Kyse30,
Kyse150, Kyse180, Kyse510 were obtained from DSMZ,
the German Resource Centre for Biological Material [44].
Cell lines were routinely maintained in RPMI 1640 or
DMEM medium plus 10% fetal calf serum at 37°C in a
humidified incubator under 5% CO2. All cell lines were
authenticated by short tandem repeat fingerprinting on
10/2013.

Lentiviral particles and transduction
The lentiviral particles obtained by short-hairpin
RNA constructs targeting Apollon were purchased
from the TRC-Mm1.0 library (Sigma Aldrich). The
target set used for Apollon (NM_016252) included
TRCN0000004157, TRCN0000004158, TRCN00000059,
TRCN0000004160, and TRCN0000004161. The pLKO.1puro lentiviral vector containing a sequence targeting
luciferase, TGACCAGGCATTCACAGAAAT was
used as the control (shC). KYSE510 cells and Eca109
cells were transfected with lentiviral particles, screened
by puromycin (1 μg/ml) and then testified by Western
blotting. Of these constructs, transduction of cells with
TRCN0000004158 (sh1) and TRCN00000059 (sh2)
produced the best knockdown. Knockdown of Smac
was achieved by the expression of shRNAs targeting
the sequence GUCUUAUUUACGUCGUCAA in Smac
(shSmac) as reported previous [45].

Antibodies

Immunohistochemistry

Primary antibodies against Survivin (#2808),
Apollon (#8745), Livin (#5471), Smac (#2954),
cleaved caspase-8 (#9496), cleaved caspase-9 (#9505),

Subcellular fractionation and Western blotting

ethanol series diluted in distilled water. Following
antigen retrieval with a 10 mM citrate buffer, ESCC
slides were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary
antibody. Afterwards the specimens were incubated with
a peroxidase labeled polymer conjugated to secondary
antibody for 30 min. They were washed again, and 3,
3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB) was used as a chromogen to
visualize the reaction. Negative controls were obtained by
substituting primary antibodies with non-immune serum.
The evaluation of immunohistochemical staining
was carried out by two independent pathologists who
were unaware of the patient outcomes. The ESCC slides
were observed under a light microscopy, for a histological
review in each case, to examine tumor microheterogeneity
in antigen distribution. Five randomized microscopic
views of 200-fold magnification of each slice were
observed and scored. A semiquantitative scoring system
was used that was based on both the staining intensity
(0, negative; 1, weak; 2, intermediate; 3, strong) and
the percentage of positive cells (0, 0% positive cells; 1,
1-10%positive cells; 2, 11-50% positive cells; 3, >50%
positive cells). The final score of each sample was
obtained by multiplying the scores for staining intensity
and percentage of cells. Samples were classified as
negative when the final scores were 0 to 3 and positive
when 4 to 9.

The mitochondrial and cytosolic fraction of cells
was isolated using a mitochondria isolation kit (Pierce,
Rockford, IL, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Western blotting was carried out as described
previously [25]. Each experiment was repeated at least
three times.

Co-IP and Immunofluorescence
Co-IP was carried out as described previously [47].
In brief, the ESCC tissue lysates were precleared with
protein A-Sepharose beads (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) at
4°C for 8 h, and then incubated with protein A-agarose
beads and antibodies at 4°C overnight. The precipitates
were pelleted and washed three times with the lysis
buffer before elution in SDS-loading dye and Western
blotting. Immunofluorescence was carried out as described
previously [47]. In brief, KYSE510 cells were fixed in icecold methanol for 1 h and blocked in PBS containing 10%
normal blocking serum followed by overnight incubation
at 4°C with the primary antibodies: monoclonal mouse
anti-Apollon antibody and monoclonal rabbit anti-Smac
antibody. After overnight incubation, the coverslips were
rinsed three times in PBS and incubated at 37°C for 1 h
with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated antimouse IgG and rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG.
The slides were then stained with DAPI, washed with
PBST, mounted, and analyzed by confocal laser scanning
microscopy (Leica TCS, Germany).

Apoptosis assays
For detection of mitochondrial membrane
potential change, cells were stained by Mito Tracker
Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 15
min at 37°C and analyzed by flow cytometry, according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. For colony formation
assays, cells were treated with drugs, and then seeded in
6-cm dishes (105 cells per dish) and cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS without anticancer drugs.
After 14 to 16 days, cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde
and stained with 0.25% crystal violet (Amresco, Solon,
Ohio) in PBS for 30 minutes. Clones were imaged using
Nikon ECLIPSE TE300 and macroscopically visible
clones in 3 randomly chosen fields per well were counted
for quantification [25]. Caspase-9 and caspase-8 activity
was determined using the caspase-9 activity assay kit
(R&D Systems Inc, Minneapolis, MN) and Caspase-Glo
8 assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions, respectively. The specific
caspase activity was expressed as a fold of the baseline
caspase activity of the control sample. Each experiment
was repeated at least three times. TUNEL staining in
tissue sections was performed by using in situ cell death
detection kit (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN,
USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Detection
and quantification of cleaved caspase in tissue sections
were carried out as reported previous [46].

Tumor xenograft models
Thirty male BALB/C nude mice (4 weeks of age,
12–14 g) were purchased from Slac Laboratory Animal
Co. Ltd., Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China)
and were raised under specific pathogen-free conditions.
All surgery was performed under anesthesia with sodium
pentobarbital. To assess the tumourigenicity of BIRC6knockdown stable clones, 107 cells of KYSE510 cells
(stable Apollon sh1 and the control clones) in 0.1 ml of
PBS were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of
each mouse. Tumor sizes were recorded thrice a week.
Mice were sacrificed at 6 weeks post-injection; tumors
were excised. Tumor volume was calculated by the
formula: 0.5 ×L × W2 (L = length of tumor; W = width of
tumor).

Statistical analysis
GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad-Prism
Software Inc., San Diego, CA) was used for statistical
analyses. Categorical variables were compared by χ2 test.
7194

Oncotarget

Continuous variables were compared using independent
two sample t-test. Univariate and multivariate analyses
were performed by the Cox proportional hazard model.
Survival curves were done by the Kaplan–Meier method
(the log-rank test). All data are presented as Means ±
standard deviations (SD). Pearson correlation analysis was
used to evaluate the association between the expression of
Apollon and Smac. The logistic regression analysis was
used to assess the association between the expression of
Apollon and chemotherapy response. All tests were twotailed and a P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.
