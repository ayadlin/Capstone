BACKGROUND. Children with high-risk neuroblastomas (NB) potentially may benefit from treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (Epo). Epo is a stimulator of erythropoiesis, acting through its receptor (EpoR). The objective of the
current study was to evaluate expression levels of Epo and EpoR in NB and in
normal tissues and their effects on the proliferation of tumor cells.

METHODS. A tissue microarray study was performed with 101 primary tumors, 39
paired metastases, 56 paired control tissues, and 6 human NB cell lines. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using antibodies against Epo and EpoR.
Immunostaining intensity was evaluated by using a semiquantitative score based
on the percentage of positive cells. An in vitro analysis of cell proliferation and
cell cycle in the presence of recombinant Epo was performed in the 6 cell lines.

RESULTS. The expression of EpoR was found to be significantly higher in tumors
than in paired control tissues (P < .0001) compared with the expression of Epo
(P 5 .06), and the expression of EpoR was significantly higher in lymph node metastases than in paired primary tumors (P 5 .02) compared with Epo (P 5 .99).
Survival analysis demonstrated that the patients who had tumors with the highest expression of EpoR had a significantly better overall survival (P 5 .03). In the
in vitro study, recombinant Epo did not modify proliferation and cell cycle in the
cell lines regardless of the EpoR expression level.

CONCLUSIONS. Epo and EpoR were expressed in NB but did not modify tumor
cell proliferation. The results of the current study suggested that Epo may be
used safely for supportive care in children with NB. Cancer 2007;110:1096–105.

E

rythropoietin (Epo), a glycoprotein hormone, is considered to be
a specific stimulator of erythropoiesis, acting through its specific
receptor (EpoR). The primary sites of physiologic Epo production
include the fetal liver and adult kidney.1 Epo gene expression is
modulated by tissue hypoxia through hypoxia-inducible factor-1
(HIF-1)-directed gene transcription.2 EpoR stimulation in erythroblasts results in proliferation, differentiation, and inhibition of
apoptosis.3,4 However, EpoR expression is not restricted to hematopoietic cells. It is expressed in a variety of other tissues, including
the central nervous system.5 Epo is a member of the cytokine superfamily, with significant homology to mediators of growth and
inflammation. Therefore, it is not surprising that additional biologic
functions for this protein have been identified.5,6 In the nervous system, the biologic roles of Epo emerge and seem to be complex.7 In
the brain, there is a paracrine Epo/EpoR system present during
embryogenesis in which neurons express EpoR and astrocytes pro-

duce Epo.8 It is interesting to note that Epo also
modulates neurotransmitter release through the activation of Ca21 channels.9
Epo and EpoR also are expressed in some adult
malignant tumors,10–13 such as cervical, endometrial,
and ovarian cancers; and their expression has been
correlated with tumor progression12,14,15 and malignant transformation.13 Those data indicated that Epo
also may act on tumor growth and progression.
Nevertheless, the results from another study indicated that treatment with recombinant Epo (rEpo)
did not influence tumor proliferation or improve survival,16 and a number of different tumor cell lines
did not demonstrate any proliferation response to
rEpo.17 The contribution of the Epo/EpoR signaling
axis to cancer progression is not completely straightforward.18
The ability of Epo to stimulate production of red
blood cells has led to the use of human rEpo for the
prevention or treatment of anemia in patients with
cancer. The benefits of human rEpo in patients with
cancer-related anemia include increased hemoglobin
levels, reduced transfusion requirements, and
improved quality of life.19 This supportive treatment
potentially is interesting in children with solid
tumors, in whom chemotherapy is used widely, and
Epo may improve their quality of life. However, considering the potential role of Epo in tumor progression, the risk must be taken into consideration,
especially for patients who have a high probability of
cure.20
Neuroblastoma (NB) is often a highly malignant
tumor of infants and young children. It accounts for
7.5% of all child cancers. NB is more prevalent in
younger children (aged <5 years), and it is the most
common solid malignant tumor in infants (aged <1
year). It is believed that this tumor arises from a
neural crest progenitor in the peripheral nervous system during development.21 NB exhibits considerable
clinical heterogeneity,21 which most likely reflects
genetic heterogeneity in the tumor cells, heterogeneity of the progenitor cells from which the tumor
arises, or both. In some infants, the tumor has a
good prognosis either because of spontaneous
regression of the tumor or because of differentiation
of the tumor leading to a benign histology type
(ganglioneuroma). Children aged >1 year often have
a poor prognosis as a result of extensive metastases.22 Several reports have described the expression
of Epo and EpoR in NB and in other pediatric tumor
cells. The expression of Epo in tumor cell lines was
hypoxia-inducible23–25 and was modulated by intracellular calcium.26 Therefore, a careful evaluation of
the impact of Epo must be explored in vitro, poten-

tially followed by clinical studies, in patients with
NB.
In the current study, we measured the expression
of Epo and EpoR in NB cells in vitro and in vivo and
evaluated the functionality of this pathway in
response to Epo. The objective of this study was to
either support or invalidate the use of Epo in children who receive chemotherapy for NB.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Tumors samples came from 101 patients with neuroblastic neoplasms who were treated and followed in
3 centers: Bicetre Hospital (Le Kremlin-Bicetre), Gustave Roussy Institute (Villejuif), and American Hospital (Reims). These patients were diagnosed between
July 1988 and November 2001, and they had a median follow-up of 60 months (range, 1–174 months).
Sixty-four patients were still alive at the last followup. There were 52 boys and 49 girls, and the median
age was 30 months (range, newborn to 151 months).
Thirty patients were aged <1 year, and 18 patients
were aged >5 years at the time of diagnosis (Table 1).
According to the International Neuroblastoma Staging System classification,27 there were 16 patients
with stage I NB, 7 patients with stage II NB, 22

patients with stage III NB, 48 patients with stage IV
NB, and 8 patients with stage IVS NB. Seventy-four
patients received chemotherapy before they underwent surgical resection. Among them, 64 patients
had an advanced tumor stage (stage III or IV). Fiftyone patients received high-dose chemotherapy with
stem cell rescue for high-risk NB.

Tumor Samples
Pathology reports were reviewed by two pathologists
(H.S. and M.F.) to assess for extent of resection and
macroscopic features. The International Neuroblastoma Pathology Committee28 criteria were used to
evaluate the degree of differentiation of each samples. Because the majority of patients had received
chemotherapy before resection (74 of 101 patients),
the prior receipt of chemotherapy was not used as
prognostic indicator. We identified undifferentiated
NB (n 5 32 patients), poorly differentiated NB
(n 5 23 patients), and differentiated NB (n 5 24
patients); intermixed ganglioneuroblastoma (n 5 13
patients) and nodular ganglioneuroblastoma (n 5 3
patients); and ganglioneuroma (n 5 6 patients). For
the patients with NB and nodular ganglioneuroblastoma, a low mitosis-karyorrhexis index28 was
observed in 31 tumors (38%), an intermediate index
was observed in 25 tumors (31%), a high index was
observed in 22 tumors (27), and the index was not
determined in 4 tumors (5%).

Tissue Microarray Construction
Normal and tumor tissue samples (primary location
and metastases) were embedded in paraffin, and
5-lm sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin
were obtained to identify viable, morphologically
representative areas of the specimen from which
core biopsies were taken. On average, 4 tissue cylinders with a 0.6-mm dimension were obtained and
brought into a recipient paraffin block using a manual tissue arrayer (Alphelys: Beecher Instruments
Micro-Array Technology, Plaisir, France).29 Four
blocks of tissue microarray (TMA) were constructed
and contained 101 primary tumors, 39 paired metastases (35 lymph nodes), 56 paired control normal tissues, and 6 cell lines of NB. In total, 746 elements
were placed in these 4 blocks: 467 primary tumors,
121 metastases (105 in lymph nodes, 13 hepatic metastases, 3 cutaneous metastases), and 158 control
samples (120 adrenal glands and 38 sympathetic
ganglia). Verification of the pathology of each tissue
element was performed by a pathologist (H.S.).

Cell Cultures
Six cell lines also were introduced in the TMA. The
NB cell lines SK-N-AS, SK-N-SH, SH-N-BE, and
IMR32 cells were purchased from the (American
Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va). The first 3
cell lines are derived from bone marrow metastasis
of NB, and the fourth cell line is derived from a primitive abdominal NB. IGR-NB8 is derived from a
pretreatment nonmetastatic NB. It exhibits the classic histologic features of undifferentiated NB along
with MYCN amplification, paradiploidy, and chromosome 1p deletion.30 IGR-N-91 is derived from a bone
marrow metastasis from a boy aged 8 years who had
stage IV NB with MYCN amplification.31
Cells were maintained in Dulbecco modified
Eagle medium (DMEM) and 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) at 378C in a humidified atmosphere consisting
of 5% carbon dioxide and 95% air. When confluence
was obtained, the cells were fixed in formalin and
embedded in paraffin. Four cylinders of cells from
each cell line were introduced in the TMA.
Immunohistochemistry
Five-micrometer sections of these tissue array blocks
were cut and placed on charged polylysine-coated
slides. These sections were used for immunohistochemical analysis. Arrayed normal tissues served as
baseline controls. All normal tissue samples showed
physiologic expression patterns of the analyzed markers. Sections from paraffin-embedded tissue were
deparaffinized, treated with 1% hydrogen peroxide in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and submitted to
antigen retrieval by microwave oven treatment for 15
minutes in 0.01 mmol/L citrate buffer (pH 6.0). This
procedure was performed for all antibodies under
study. Slides subsequently were incubated by appropriately diluted primary antibody incubation for
1 hour at room temperature. Rabbit antihuman polyclonal antibodies to Epo (1:20 dilution; H-162; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif ) and Epo R
(1:100 dilution; c-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were
used. Then, samples were incubated with biotinylated antirabbit immunoglobulins (LSAB II; DAKO,
Glostrup, Denmark) at room temperature for 30 minutes followed by avidin-biotin peroxidase complexes
for 30 minutes. For the chromogen, 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazol was used, and hematoxylin was used as the
nuclear counterstain. Normal rabbit immunoglobulin
G (IgG) at the same concentration as the primary
antibody served as negative controls. The slides were
then incubated with this solution instead of the primary antibody. Positive controls were normal sections from first-trimester placenta for Epo32 and fetal
liver for EpoR.

Erythropoietin in Neuroblastoma/Sartlet et al.

Sections from the TMA were treated in 1 set of
immunostaining for each marker, and the 2 readers
(H.S. and M.F.) were blinded to the clinical data at
the time of scoring. Epo and EpoR immunostaining
scores were established by semiquantitative optical
analysis using the percentage of positive cells: 0, no
labeling; 11, mild labeling (<50% positive tumor
cells); 21, moderate labeling (50–80% positive cells);
and 31, intense labeling (>80% positive cells).

Methyl-thiazoldiphenyl Tetrazolium Cell Growth
Determination Assay
The 6 cell lines present in the TMA were used for the
in vitro study of cell proliferation by methyl-thiazoldiphenyl tetrazolium (MTT) (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Growth
was assayed using the standard MTT assay according
to the supplier’s instructions. The assay colorimetrically measures the accumulation of a formazan dye
generated by the conversion of MTT by active mitochondrial dehydrogenases in living cells.33 Briefly,
cells (100 lL; 3000 cells per well in 96-well plates)
were incubated with increasing doses of rEpo (0.24–
150 U/mL) surrounding the level of 1 U/mL generally used for in vitro study26 (Amgen, Thousand
Oaks, Calif). Ten microliters of MTT reagent (5 mg/
mL) in PBS were added to each well (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, Ind). The plates were
incubated for 3 hours at 378C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The medium was gently aspirated, and the
resulting formazan was dissolved in 100 lL of lytic
solution (pH 4.7) (N,N-dimethylformamide diluted
one-third with sodium dodecyl sulfate 30% solution).
Plates were incubated 2 hours at 378C; then, sample
absorbance at 570 nanometers (nm) was measured
using a spectrophotometer. Assays were performed in
quadruplicate, and the mean cell viability was compared with control cells, which received only 100 lL
of DMEM and 10% FBS without Epo, and with cells
that were treated with increasing doses of soluble
rEpo (0.12 U/mL, 0.6 U/mL, 3 U/mL, 15 U/mL, and
75 U/mL). Two cell lines (SK-N-AS and SK-N-SH)
were treated during 3 days, 6 days, and 8 days; and all
cell lines were treated during 4 days. The experiments
were repeated on 2 separate occasions.
Flow Cytometry
We used flow-cytometric analysis of the DNA from
the 6 cells lines to determine whether Epo enhanced
growth by increasing proliferation or decreasing apoptosis. Cells were seeded in medium containing 10%
FBS and were treated with Epo (3 U/mL) overnight.
Cells were collected using 0.5% trypsin and were
resuspended in cold PBS at a concentration of

1099

1 3 106/mL. A 10% volume of 103 propidium iodide
solution (2.5 mg/mL propidium iodide, 100 mg/mL
sodium citrate, and 10mg/mL of RNase solution) was
added, and cells were acquired in a flow cytometer
(FACSCALIBUR; Becton Dickinson Biosciences, San
Jose, Calif) within 1 hour. A cell-fit program (CELLQuest, version 5.1; Becton Dickinson Bioscience) was
used to calculate the fraction of cells with 2n, 2n–4n,
and 4n amounts of DNA, corresponding to G0-G1, S-,
and G2-M phases of the cell cycle. Fractions of cells
in different cell cycle phases with or without Epo
were compared.

Statistical Analysis
The median expression value of Epo and EpoR was
used to summarize the expression from the different
cores of a particular tissue for a given patient. Differences in the level of expression between the different
tissue types (tumor vs normal tissue or tumor vs metastases) were tested by using the Wilcoxon signedrank test for comparison of paired data. Univariate
analysis of the immunohistochemical expression
according to several clinical variables was performed
using the Wilcoxon 2-sample test to compare the
level of expression. Overall survival was computed
from the time of surgery of the primary tumor as
baseline to the time of death or last follow-up.
Event-free survival was computed from the time of
surgery of the primary tumor as baseline to the time
of first event (local recurrence, metastasis, or death)
or last follow-up. For survival analysis, expression of
the 2 biomarkers was dichotomized into 2 classes:
expression values less than or equal to the median
value of the patients and expression values greater
than the median value of the patients. A log-rank
test stratified by center was used to assess differences of survival between the group of patients with
low expression levels and the group of patients with
high expression levels. A Cox regression model stratified by center was computed for multivariate analysis. Relations between expression levels of the
biomarkers were studied using a Spearman rankorder correlation coefficient and were tested by using
the Spearman rank test. The significance level chosen
was P < .05, and all tests were 2-sided. Statistical
analyses were performed with the SAS software (version 8.2; SAS Institute Inc, Cary NC).

chemistry expression. Only 49 pairs had a complete
assessment of Epo expression, whereas there were 51
complete pairs available for the assessment of EpoR
expression. Normal ganglion cells in sympathetic
ganglia and normal cells in adrenal medulla in particular demonstrated cytoplasmic expression of Epo (8
control samples had Epo expression >0) (Fig. 1A). In
tumor samples, Epo expression was identified only in
neuroblastic cells and not in Schwannian stroma
cells. Sixteen of the 56 tumor samples expressed Epo
(Fig. 1B,C). Epo expression was identified in differentiated (but not in undifferentiated) neuroblastic cells.
There was a tendency toward higher expression of
Epo in tumor samples compared with control samples, but the difference in expression was not statistically significant (P 5 .06; Wilcoxon signed-rank test)
(Fig. 2A).
EpoR demonstrated low cytoplasmic and/or
membranous expression in normal ganglion cells, in
sympathetic ganglia, and in normal cells of the adrenal medulla (Fig. 1D). Positive immunostaining was
observed in 23 control samples. In tumor samples,
the stroma cells always were negative for EpoR. This
receptor was expressed preferentially in differentiated
(but rarely in undifferentiated) neuroblastic cells
(Fig. 1E,F). Thirty-eight tumor samples had positive
expression of EpoR. EpoR expression was significantly higher in tumor samples compared with its
expression in the corresponding normal tissue samples (P < .0001) (Fig. 2B).
When the polyclonal antibodies against Epo and
EpoR were replaced by normal rabbit IgG at the
same concentration, no immunostaining was observed. For positive control, Epo was expressed in
trophoblasts in the normal first-trimester placenta,
and EpoR was expressed in the erythroblasts of fetal
liver.

Comparison of Expression Between NB and
Metastatic Tissues
The expression levels of Epo and EpoR were similar
in the 39 pairs of primary and metastatic tumors
(Epo, P 5 .70; EpoR, P 5 .10), although EpoR was
expressed significantly more in the 35 lymph node
metastases compared with the corresponding primary tumor samples (P 5 .02) (Fig. 2D) contrary with
Epo (P 5 .99) (Fig. 2C).
Association Between Primary Tumor Expression
and Clinical Variables
Twenty-nine tumors expressed both Epo and EpoR.
There was no significant association between the
expression of Epo and EpoR and tumor stage (Wilcoxon test: P 5 .45 and P 5 .21, respectively). The

expression of EpoR was significantly higher in
tumors from patients aged <1 year (P 5 .04) compared with patients aged 1 year. This was not true
for the expression f Epo (P 5 .82). The expression of
EpoR also was significantly higher in tumors that
had malignant histology (undifferentiated, poorly differentiated, and differentiated NB) compared with
tumors that had benign histology (intermixed, nodular ganglioneuroblastoma, and ganglioneuroma;
P 5 .02). Primary location of the tumor, induction
chemotherapy, and MYCN amplification had no significant influence on the level of expression of Epo
or EpoR (P 5 .51, P 5 .90, P 5 .14, P 5 .70, P 5 .44,
and P 5 .60, respectively).
A survival analysis stratified by center indicated
that patients who had tumors that expressed more
EpoR (median, >1) had a statistically significant better
survival than patients who had tumors with low
expression of EpoR (log-rank P 5 .03), but no difference was observed with high expression of Epo (Fig. 3).
Event-free survival did not differ significantly between
patients who had high expression of Epo (and EpoR)
compared with patients who had low expression of
Epo (and EpoR; log-rank P 5 .32 and P 5 .07, respectively) (Fig. 4). A multivariate survival model stratified
by center and adjusted for induction chemotherapy,
tumor stage, and age yielded an independent prognostic effect of EpoR expression (Table 2) (P 5 .01). No
significant differences were observed in the Epo analyses. Applying the Spearman rank test, we identified
no significant correlation between the expression of
Epo and the expression of EpoR (P 5 .16 and P 5 .11,
respectively).

Action of Epo in Proliferation and Apoptosis
of Neuroblastoma Cells
None of the 6 cell lines expressed Epo. The expression of EpoR was moderate in SK-N-AS cells; low in
SK-N-BE(2) and IGR-N-91 cells; and absent in SK-NSH, IMR 32, and IGR-NB8 cells. Figure 5 depicts the
effects of Epo on cell proliferation. There was no noticeable difference between cells that were treated or
were not treated with Epo. An increase in the Epo
concentration and in the duration of exposure did
not significantly modify the number of cells. Moreover, the presence of EpoR detected in the SK-N-AS,
SK-N-BE(2), and IGR-N-91 cell lines by immunohistochemistry did not result in any modification of cell
proliferation.
To confirm these results and to study the cell
cycle in neuroblasts treated by Epo, we measured
DNA content by flow cytometry in the 6 cell lines.
We observed that treating cells with Epo (3 U/mL)
overnight did not modify the percentage of cells in

was observed. In addition, no cells were in sub-G1,
suggesting the lack of Epo-induced apoptosis. Similar
results were observed in the SK-N-AS, SK-N-BE(2),
and IGR-N-91 cell lines, which expressed EpoR, and
the other cell lines, which did not express EpoR.
Thus, Epo did not modify NB cell proliferation or
cell cycle.

DISCUSSION
With greater use of dose-intense and dose-dense
chemotherapy regimens, awareness of anemia has
increased as a significant and treatable complication
of cancer and cancer therapies.34 Anemia is a potential contributor to the functional impairment that often occurs during and after chemotherapy. Among
children with malignant solid tumors, and particularly among children with NB, a significant proportion (51–74%) experience anemia at diagnosis35 and
during treatment. Anemia is associated with a significant impairment in quality of life caused by fatigue.
Children with progressive and advanced NB are treated with intensive induction chemotherapy that contains platinum compounds, followed by high-dose
chemotherapy, and bone marrow transplantation.
Treatment with human rEpo may be beneficial. Several studies already have demonstrated that rEpo is a
safe and effective therapy for increasing the level of

transfusions in pediatric patients with malignant
solid tumors who are receiving chemotherapy.36–40
However, in 1 study, no benefit was observed from
the addition of Epo to a granulocyte-colony stimulating factor regimen for patients who were receiving
intensive induction chemotherapy for high-risk NB.41
In our current study, we demonstrated that, in
control tissues, expression of Epo was rare, and
expression was low for EpoR and was located only
on neuronal cells, and not in stroma. In tumor samples, Epo and EpoR were located only in neuroblastic
cells. The level of expression of Epo was low and
inconstant (only 36% of tumors), as in other types of
tumors42; however, EpoR expression was observed in
71% of primary tumors with mild to moderate intensity and was significantly higher than the expression
in control tissues. Epo was not found to be correlated
with any of the clinical or biologic prognostic factors
(stage at diagnosis, MYCN amplification, primary tumor location, or previous exposure to cisplatin-con-

taining induction chemotherapy), whereas EpoR was
observed more frequently in young patients who had
a better prognosis. However, EpoR expression was
higher in lymph nodes metastases than in primitive
tumors.
Epo is not only a ligand of EpoR. A recent review
of the biologic roles of Epo in the nervous system
was published recently7 and demonstrated that the
action of Epo in this tissue is multiple and complex.
Epo and its receptor are present during development
of the nervous system,8 they modulate neurotransmitter release,9 and they have neurotrophic effects.
In fact, an early study indicating a role for Epo in the
nervous system demonstrated that the administration of Epo has a neurotrophic effect on the growth
of neuronal process in culture.43 We also can
hypothesize that EpoR, as in normal development, is
present in tumor neuroblasts when they begin their
differentiation, which may explain why the expression of EpoR also was significantly higher in undifferentiated tumors compared with tumors that had
benign differentiated histology. To explain higher
expression in lymph node metastasis, we know that
EpoR is not appreciably sensitive to hypoxia; rather,
it is regulated by proinflammatory cytokines,6 which
are numerous in lymph node metastasis.

FIGURE 5. The effect of erythropoietin (Epo) on cell growth in vitro. Growth was assayed using the standard methyl-thiazoldiphenyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay
(3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide), which colorimetrically measures the accumulation of a formazan dye generated by the conversion
of MTT by active mitochondrial dehydrogenases in living cells. Various concentration of Epo (0.12 U/mL, 0.6 U/mL, 3 U/mL, 15 U/mL, and 75 U/mL) were added
to the medium. Measurements were done at 4 days with all cell lines (NB8, SKNBE, IMR 32, N91, SKNAS, and SNK SH).

FIGURE 6. DNA content was measured by flow cytometry in 2 cell lines that expressed erythropoietin (Epo) receptor (SK-N-BE[2]), and that did not express
Epo receptor (IMR 32). Cells were seeded overnight in a medium that contained 10% fetal bovine serum without or with Epo (3 U/mL).

It has been demonstrated that Epo stimulates
breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro12 and also
enhances the resistance of cervical cancer cells to
chemotherapeutic drug.13 Epo-treated ovarian cancer
cells became resistant to paclitaxel and survived lon-

ger than non-Epo-treated cells.14 However, the
increase in cell survival was not dramatic, and the
effects of Epo on cisplatin-induced cell death were
minimal. Then, the consequence of expression of
Epo and its receptors in the proliferation and survival

Erythropoietin in Neuroblastoma/Sartlet et al.

of neuroblastic cells had to be explored in vitro. Data
showed that Epo did not produce any increase of
proliferation in tumor cells lines, confirming the
results from a prior study.43 The presence or the absence of EpoR did not have an impact on cell line
proliferation, but the presence of this protein does
not prejudge its functionality. We hypothesize that
Epo does not stimulate proliferation in NB; rather, it
protects cells against metabolic stress. These data
could be completed by in vivo study, particularly in a
xenograft model, to study the possibility of an indirect effect of Epo through the stimulation of tumor
stroma.
It is well known that some pediatric solid tumors
can be associated with paraneoplastic polycythemia.
Elevated serum Epo levels have been recognized in
patients who have tumors with common mutations
of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor
gene.44 EpoR expression also was reported in patients
with renal cell carcinoma, and a potential paracrine
or autocrine role for Epo, which promotes the growth
of renal carcinomas, has been suggested.45 However,
polycythemia is very rare in NB, with only few
patients described in the literature,46,47 and some
polycythemia reportedly was secondary to the hyperexpression of Epo.48
The current data showed the presence of Epo
and EpoR in NB and the up-regulation of EpoR in
NB compared with normal tissues. High expression
of EpoR was associated with an increased survival.
Epo treatment did not modify neuroblastic cell line
proliferation. Our results suggest that Epo and EpoR
may have a biologic role in the differentiation, but
not in the proliferation, of neuroblastic tumor cells.
The use of Epo in children receiving chemotherapy
for a NB may be proposed, but its interest as a supportive care treatment must be confirmed by clinical
studies with carefully controlled clinical trials.
