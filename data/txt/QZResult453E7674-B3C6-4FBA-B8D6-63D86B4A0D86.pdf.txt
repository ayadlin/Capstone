ABSTRACT
Resistance to docetaxel is a major clinical problem in advanced prostate cancer.
The overexpression of AXL receptor tyrosine kinase (AXL) has been correlated with
chemotherapeutic drug resistance. However, the role of AXL expression in docetaxel
resistance in prostate cancer is yet unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that AXL is
overexpressed and activated independent of Gas6 in docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer
cells (PC3-DR and DU145-DR). Moreover, we show that forced overexpression of AXL
in PC3 and DU145 cells is sufficient to induce resistance to docetaxel in these cell lines.
Notably, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of AXL in the resistant models suppressed cell
proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumor growth, and these effects were significantly
augmented when AXL inhibition was combined with docetaxel treatment. Mechanistically,
we found that AXL inhibition led to reversion of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) phenotype and decreased the expression of ATP-binding cassette B1 (ABCB1).
Overall, our results identify AXL as an important mediator of docetaxel resistance in
prostate cancer. We propose that AXL-targeted therapy, in combination with docetaxel,
has the potential to improve the response to docetaxel therapy and reduce resistance
induced by prolonged docetaxel therapy in prostate cancer.

poor prognosis and limited treatment options in advanced
prostate cancer [5–6]. Therefore, new treatment modalities
are being actively pursued with novel agents, alone or in
combination with the existing chemotherapeutic agents, to
extend the survival of these patients.
AXL receptor tyrosine kinase (AXL) is a member
of the TAM (TYRO3, AXL, MER) family of receptor
tyrosine kinases (RTK), activated through several
mechanisms, including binding of their ligands, growth
arrest-specific 6 (Gas6) [7–9], extracellular domainmediated dimerization [10], or crosstalk with the
extracellular domains on neighboring cells [11]. Studies

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed
noncutaneous tumor and the second leading cause of
cancer-related deaths in men [1, 2]. Although many
patients with prostate cancer are initially responsive to
anti-androgen therapy, most patients eventually develop
advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).
While docetaxel is considered a standard first-line therapy
in such cases [3], it only gives a modest survival advantage
as patients eventually acquire resistance to docetaxel [4].
In addition, docetaxel resistance is often associated with

have indicated that AXL overexpression and activation
plays important roles in cell proliferation, migration, and
invasion of tumor cells in many malignancies [12]. In
addition, elevated AXL expression has been found to be
correlated with adverse prognosis and distant metastasis
in some cancers [13, 14]. Recently, increased expression
or abnormal activation of AXL has particularly been
implicated in resistance to cancer chemotherapy and
targeted therapy. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition
or genetic knockdown of AXL restored sensitivity to
these drugs, indicating the role of AXL in drug resistance
[15–22]. Collectively, these data indicate that AXL may
function as a potent oncogene that can improve resistance
to conventional and targeted cancer therapies.
Despite many reports on the function of AXL in
drug-resistance, the role of AXL overexpression in the
treatment of prostate cancer using docetaxel has been
poorly discussed. In this study, we showed that AXL was
highly overexpressed and activated in docetaxel resistant
PC3 and DU145 cells (PC3-DR and DU145-DR) in a
Gas6- independent manner. Furthermore, AXL inhibition
augmented the antitumor effect of docetaxel both in vitro
and in vivo. Thus, this work indicates that elevated AXL
expression can mediate docetaxel resistance and provide a
rationale for the clinical evaluation of anti-AXL therapeutics
for the treatment of docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer.

binding, we treated cells with increasing doses of Gas6. Our
results indicated that upon increasing Gas6 dosage, p-AXL
levels increased markedly in the parental cells but were
only slightly elevated in the corresponding resistant cells
(Figure 1C). In addition, Gas6 protein levels in the resistant
cells were found to be lower than their levels in the parental
cells (Figure 1D). Collectively, the data demonstrate that
AXL is clearly upregulated and the constitutive activation of
AXL is independent of Gas6 in docetaxel-resistant prostate
cancer cells.

Resistance to docetaxel in prostate cancer cells is
associated with AXL levels
Having identified that AXL was overexpressed in
the PC3-DR and DU145-DR cells, we further investigated
whether genetic upregulation of AXL led to docetaxel
resistance in prostate cancer cells. We transiently
transfected the PC3 and DU145 cells with the wild-type
AXL plasmid for 72 h and then treated the cells with
docetaxel for 72 h. The increased AXL expression was
confirmed by western blotting (Supplementary Figure 2).
This was associated with the emergence of resistance
to docetaxel, indicated by increased IC50 values of
54 nmol/L and 2026 nm/L (Figure 2A) in the PC3 and
DU145 cells, respectively, suggesting that forced AXL
overexpression undermined the growth inhibition effects
induced by docetaxel. To further assess the role of AXL
in docetaxel resistance, we knocked down AXL using
siRNA in DU145-DR cells (Supplementary Figure 3) and
found that AXL gene knockdown in these cells sensitized
them to docetaxel (Figure 2B). Next, we sought to validate
our genetic findings using a commercially available
small molecule inhibitor of AXL, amuvatinib (MP470).
The treatment of resistant cells with MP470 (1.875 μM)
resulted in a marked suppression of AXL expression and
cell proliferation (Figure 2C). To explore the synergistic
effects of MP470 in combination with docetaxel, we
conducted a combination index (CI) analysis in the two
resistant cells. We found that pretreatment with MP470
was synergistic with subsequent docetaxel treatment at
50%, 75%, and 90% effective concentrations (EC50,
EC75, and EC90, Table 1a), and this was further confirmed
by another AXL specific inhibitor, R428 (Table 1b). Taken
together, the genetic and pharmacological data indicate that
AXL is required for acquirement of docetaxel resistance.

RESULTS
AXL is upregulated and activated independent
of Gas6 in docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer
cells
To investigate the expression and activation of AXL
in docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer, we established two
docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cell lines (PC3-DR and
DU145-DR) by culturing PC3 and DU145 cells in docetaxel
in a dose-escalation manner. In this study, cell growth assay
was conducted to test the effect of docetaxel treatment on
the viability of the parental and resistant cells. As shown in
Figure 1A, PC3 and DU145 cells were sensitive to docetaxel
treatment, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration
(IC50) of 8 and 25 nmol/L, respectively, whereas the resistant
cells had significantly higher IC50 values of 168 nmol/L
and 5022 nmol/L, indicating ~21-fold and 200-fold higher
resistance to docetaxel than the parental cells, respectively.
The resistant cells maintained their docetaxel resistance
when grown for several weeks in a docetaxel-free media and
acquired an irregular shape and a smaller size as compared to
the sensitive cells (Supplementary Figure 1). Besides having
a distinct morphology, the resistant cells also had increased
invasion rates when compared to the parental cells (Figure
1B). Moreover, both the resistant cell lines exhibited higher
levels of phosphorylated AXL (phospho-AXL, p-AXL)
and total AXL compared to those of the parental cells. To
determine whether AXL activation was dependent on Gas6

AXL inhibition effectively induces apoptosis and

Based on the above findings, we further examined
whether AXL inhibition was also effective in inducing
apoptosis and suppressing the migration and invasion
of cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
analyses indicated that both siRNA-mediated inhibition of

apoptosis in PC3-DR and DU145-DR cells (Figure 3A).
Further, a combination of AXL inhibition with docetaxel
treatment induced a higher apoptotic effect on these cells

than the single treatments. We further explored whether
AXL upregulated the migratory and invasive potential
of the resistant cells by transwell assays. Our studies
demonstrated that AXL knockdown significantly inhibited

as compared with control cells. A greater suppression
was observed when AXL inhibition was combined with
docetaxel treatment (Figure 3B and 3C). In addition, we

sought to validate the above genetic findings using an AXL
inhibitor. Based on the concentration-response growth
curves and apoptosis analysis, the doses of docetaxel

MP470 (1.875 μM for both cells) that produced ~30%
growth inhibition were chosen for use in the combination
experiments (Figure 1A, Figure 2C and Supplementary
Figure 4). As shown in Figure 3D, treatment with either
drug significantly reduced the AXL and p-AXL protein
levels. The combination treatment with both the drugs
exhibited a stronger suppression of AXL and p-AXL
expression as compared to the single treatments (Figure
3D). As expected, the effects of the pharmacologic
inhibition of AXL on both the resistant cells further
validate the genetic-inhibition results (Figure 3E). Overall,
these investigations indicate that the resistant cells were
reliant on AXL for apoptosis, cell migration, and invasion.

(Figure 4E). Our results thus demonstrate that AXL
inhibition restored docetaxel sensitivity in vivo.

AXL-mediated docetaxel resistance is associated
with EMT phenotypes
We further sought to identify the signaling events
downstream of AXL that might promote the acquired
resistance to docetaxel in prostate cancer. R428, a
specific AXL inhibitor, which markedly suppressed
AXL expression and induced apoptosis in the resistant
cell lines (Supplementary Figure 5), was used to
examine the impact of AXL inhibition on the signaling
pathways. We found that R428 treatment clearly reduced
the phosphorylation levels of the extracellular signalregulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), and protein
kinase B (PKB, also known as AKT) in the resistant
cells, whereas their total expression levels remained
unchanged (Supplementary Figure 6). To test whether
AXL played a role in EMT induction, we first assessed
the effects of AXL overexpression on the expression of
EMT marker proteins. Forced overexpression of AXL in
PC3 and DU145 cells significantly enhanced the levels
of the mesenchymal marker, vimentin, and reduced the
expression of the epithelial marker, epithelial cadherin
(E-cadherin, Figure 5A). In addition, the inhibition of
AXL using R428 was found to upregulate E-cadherin
and downregulate vimentin in both the resistant cells.
The combination treatment of R428 with docetaxel
induced higher E-cadherin and lower vimentin
expression as compared to the single drug treatments
(Figure 5B). The effect of AXL inhibition by MP470 in
vivo further confirmed the in vitro findings (Figure 5C).
To further elucidate the mechanism of AXL regulation
of EMT induction, we focused on the nuclear factor
kappa-B (NF-κB) pathway, since this pathway has been
proven to be a downstream target of AXL activation

AXL inhibition restores docetaxel sensitivity in
DU145-DR xenograft tumors
To further explore the effect of AXL inhibition
on docetaxel resistance in vivo, a xenograft study was
performed to determine the therapeutic effects of MP470
and docetaxel, alone or in combination. Our results
indicated that 60 mg/kg MP470 or 10 mg/kg docetaxel
effectively inhibited tumor growth and lowered the weight
of DU145-DR xenografts as compared to the untreated
xenografts in athymic nude mice (Figure 4A and 4B).
The immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses of DU145DR tumor specimens indicated that MP470 or docetaxel
alone significantly inhibited the expression of AXL in
DU145-DR xenografts (Figure 4C and 4D). Moreover, the
combined treatment of MP470 and docetaxel led to lower
AXL expression, particularly that of p-AXL, which was
in agreement with the in vitro results (Figure 4C and 4D).
Further, the combination treatment was more effective
than the single drug treatments in suppressing tumor
growth (Figure 4A and 4B) and inducing tumor apoptosis

and the NF-κB activation inhibitor II (JSH-23), and
their effects on the expression of EMT markers were

analyzed. Our results showed that AXL inhibition by
R428 markedly decreased the phosphorylation level of
NF-κB p65, and NF-κB inhibition by JSH-23 led to an

upregulation

increase in E-cadherin and a decrease in vimentin levels
(Figure 5D). Taken together, the data suggest that AXL
upregulation activates AKT, ERK, or NF-κB signaling
to promote resistance to docetaxel treatment in prostate
cancer, perhaps in association with the acquisition of
EMT. The NF-κB pathway may also be involved in
AXL-induced EMT phenotype in docetaxel-resistant
prostate cancer.

Overexpression of ABCB1 is regarded as an
important mechanism involved in the acquisition of
docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer. In our study,
exogenous AXL overexpression in the PC3 and DU145
cells was shown to induce a higher ABCB1 expression

than in the parental cells (Figure 6A). In addition, AXL
inhibition by siRNA led to a marked decrease in the
ABCB1 levels in the resistant cell lines (Figure 6B).
Moreover, a similar lowering of ABCB1 expression was
observed in vitro upon treatment with R428. Interestingly,
the combined treatment of R428 with docetaxel induced
further lowering of ABCB1 expression compared to
treatment with either drug alone (Figure 6C). Additionally,
in vivo immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that
AXL inhibition significantly lowered the ABCB1 levels,
further corroborating our in vitro observations (Figure
6D). We next determine whether ABCB1 was functionally
involved in AXL-mediated docetaxel resistance, The
results indicated that ABCB1 overexpression partly
recapitulated the docetaxel resistance in AXL-knockdownresistant cells (Figure 6E). Collectively, our findings
suggest that ABCB1 upregulation may be another
mechanism of AXL-mediated docetaxel resistance in
prostate cancer.

(AR) splicing [26, 27], epithelial plasticity [28, 29], and
stem cells [30]. A better understanding of the mechanisms
by which docetaxel resistance develops in prostate cancer
can enable the development of improved treatment
strategies. Recent studies have found high levels of AXL
expression in advanced human prostate cancer tissue [8].
Furthermore, in vitro studies suggest that AXL signaling
is associated with prostate cancer development and
progression [8, 31]. The study herein is the first to describe
a role of AXL in resistance to docetaxel both in vitro and
in vivo, and thus, provides a rationale for the development
and use of anti-AXL therapeutics for the treatment of
docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer.
Docetaxel resistance is challenging to study owing
to the lack of access to patient tissue upon relapse.
To model docetaxel mechanisms that may occur in
humans, several models of acquired resistance have been
established via prolonged exposure of sensitive cells
to docetaxel [29, 30, 32]. Some models indicated that
resistant clones and tumors had an increased expression
of and dependency on AXL [15–22]. In the current study,
AXL was found to be overexpressed and activated in the
PC3-DR and DU145-DR cells as compared to the parental
cells. Activation of AXL often occurs upon binding to
Gas6, including in prostate cancer [7, 8, 12]. However,
in our study, although elevated AXL activation was found
in the resistant cells, their Gas6-responsiveness was not
correspondingly noticeably improved. Furthermore,

DISCUSSION
Docetaxel therapy has yielded clinical benefits
for advanced prostate cancer; however, both intrinsic
and acquired resistance are common outcomes.
Multiple mechanisms of docetaxel resistance exist in
prostate cancer, including ABC transporters [23, 24],
glucocorticoid receptor (GR) [25], androgen receptor

lower Gas6 expression was observed in the resistant cells
compared with the parental cells, suggesting a possibility
of Gas6-independent AXL activation. The data may be
explained by prior studies in which overexpression of
AXL and treatment with drugs caused ligand-independent
autoactivation of AXL [10, 33]. Moreover, our studies also
demonstrated that forced overexpression of AXL in the
PC3 and DU145 cells markedly improved their capacity to
resist the toxic effects of docetaxel, indicated by increased
IC50 values. Taken together, these results indicate that
AXL overexpression and activation, independent of Gas6,
is closely related to docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer.

Being of therapeutic interest, we investigated whether
AXL inhibition is sufficient to reverse the resistance to
docetaxel in prostate cancer. Our results demonstrate that
AXL inhibition by siRNA partly suppressed the growth
and invasiveness, and induced apoptosis in the resistant
cells, and the combination of AXL knockdown with
docetaxel treatment induced a greater inhibitory effect on
the resistant cells. With increasing evidence supporting
the role of AXL in resistance to cancer chemotherapy and
targeted therapy, many AXL inhibitors, including small
molecule inhibitors, anti-AXL monoclonal antibodies, and
nucleotide aptamers, are under development [22]. In this

study, two AXL inhibitors were tested: MP470, a structurebased multitargeted RTK inhibitor that targets mutant
AXL, c-Kit, and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor
α (PDGFRα); and R428, a specific small molecule AXL
tyrosine kinase inhibitor [22]. In previous studies, both
MP470 [15, 34, 35] and R428 [34, 36, 37] were shown to
suppress AXL expression and recover drug sensitivity in
many models of acquired resistance. MP470 was recently
reported for discontinuous phase II clinical development
by Astex Pharmaceuticals and R428 is undergoing phase I/
II clinical trials by Rigel Pharmaceuticals [38]. Consistent
with prior studies, the two inhibitors were demonstrated
to significantly reduce the expression of AXL and p-AXL
in our study. Moreover, we also demonstrated that the
suppression of AXL using inhibitors was sufficient to
reverse the resistance to docetaxel in the resistant cells,
which further validated the genetic-inhibition effect.
Importantly, our in vivo results further confirmed our
in vitro observations. Collectively, our findings suggest
that targeting AXL is effective in overcoming docetaxel
resistance in prostate cancer.
EMT is typically characterized by the loss of
expression of epithelial markers (i.e., E-cadherin)
and gain of expression of mesenchymal markers (i.e.,
vimentin). Several studies have shown that EMT mediates
docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer [28, 29]. In this
study, we found that AXL-overexpressing PC3-DR and
DU145-DR cells exhibited increased migration and
adhesion, properties associated with EMT, which were
suppressed by AXL inhibition via siRNA and RTK
inhibitors. Furthermore, AXL inhibition also led to higher
E-cadherin and lower vimentin expression levels both
in vitro and in vivo. These findings were further verified
by our observation of forced expression of AXL in PC3
and DU145 cells leading to lower E-cadherin and higher
vimentin expression levels. These studies indicate that
EMT could be driven by both intrinsic and acquired
increase in AXL. Moreover, our data also suggest that
activation of multiple pathways including AKT, ERK, and
NF-kB may promote docetaxel resistance downstream
of AXL upregulation in the resistant cells. This is in
concordance with prior studies indicating that AXL can
drive the growth of cancer cells through the activation of
each of these pathways [15, 16, 34, 39, 40]. Additionally,
our studies further show that NF-kB maybe involved in
AXL-mediated EMT regulation. Therefore, our findings
suggest that induction of EMT contributes to the AXLmediated acquired docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer.
Further work will be necessary to completely elucidate the
mechanisms by which AXL might promote resistance in
prostate cancer through the induction of EMT.
ABCB1, a verified mechanism underlying docetaxel
resistance in prostate cancer, is induced by docetaxel
and diminishes its efficacy by transporting it across the
cell membrane [23, 24]. Our results indicated a marked
upregulation of ABCB1 in resistant cells, which is
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

consistent with prior studies (data not shown). Our
study also showed that forced expression of AXL in the
PC3 and DU145 cells led to an increased ABCB1 level,
suggesting the possible association of ABCB1 with
AXL overexpression. Some RTK inhibitors have been
shown to inhibit the drug efflux function of ABCB1, thus
overcoming the resistance of cancer cells to traditional
chemotherapeutic drugs [41, 42]. In the current study, our
data revealed that the AXL-specific inhibitor, R428, was
sufficient to suppress ABCB1 protein expression in the
resistant cells. In subsequent xenograft tumors, another
AXL inhibitor, MP470, was also found to significantly
block ABCB1 expression. Furthermore, downregulation of
AXL using R428 or MP470 in combination with docetaxel
led to stronger suppression of ABCB1 expression in vitro
and in vivo. Moreover, we also provided evidence that
ABCB1 overexpression suppressed docetaxel response in
AXL-knockdown-resistant cells. These findings suggest
that ABCB1 may be involved in AXL-mediated resistance
to docetaxel and thus may be another mechanism
underlying docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer. Some
studies also indicated that the increase in ABCB1 may
be associated with EMT [43, 44]. Taken together, more
studies may be necessary to determine the exact roles
ABCB1 plays in AXL-mediated resistance to docetaxel in
prostate cancer.
Our study has several limitations. We used
subcutaneous, not orthotopic, injection to model soft
tissue growth. Although orthotopic injection is ideal, it
is challenging to model because of the anatomy of the
mouse prostate [45]. Another limitation of our study is
that we used androgen receptor-negative cell lines, which
are commonly used in prostate cancer studies. However, it
has been demonstrated that some of the antitumor actions
of docetaxel can be attributed to its effect on the androgen
receptor axis [27, 28]. Thus, our study did not totally
recapitulate the clinical disease, and we propose to use the
androgen receptor-positive cell lines, such as VCaP and
C4-2B, in future studies.
In summary, our research showed that the inhibition
of AXL has an antitumor effect in models of docetaxelresistant prostate cancer. Furthermore, AXL inhibition had
synergistic activity with docetaxel and markedly enhanced
docetaxel-mediated cytotoxicity in docetaxel-resistant
cells. These findings suggest that AXL inhibitors should
be evaluated in clinical trials as adjuvants with docetaxel
in the treatment of docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer.

against AKT, phospho-AKT (p-AKT, ser473), ERK, and
phospho-ERK (p-ERK, Thr202/Tyr204) were purchased
from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA).
Recombinant Gas6 was purchased from R&D Systems
(Minneapolis, MN, USA). JSH-23, MP470, and R428

Junction, NJ, USA).

were harvested, and western blotting was performed
to confirm the overexpression of AXL or ABCB1.
For AXL knockdown, lentiviral-based AXL shRNA
constructs were obtained from Open Biosystems
(Huntsville, AL, USA). PC3-DR and DU145-DR cells
were transiently transfected with shRNA against AXL
or the vector control, shGFP, using lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Forty-eight hours
after transfection, the transfected cells were subject to
selection using 1.0 μg/ml puromycin. The transfection
efficiency of the cells was monitored by fluorescence
microscopy (OLYMPUS IX51×200). Quantitative
real time RT-PCR was performed to confirm AXL
knockdown.

Cell culture and establishment of docetaxelresistant subclones
The human prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and
DU145 were purchased from the Cell Bank of Shanghai
Life Science Institution, Chinese Academy of Sciences
and grown in F12 and RPMI 1640 media, respectively,
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) in a humidified incubator (Thermo
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at 37°C with 5% CO2.
The cells were incubated with gradually increasing
concentrations of docetaxel, starting at 0.1 nM and 2.5 nM
for PC3 and DU145, respectively, and maintained until
the docetaxel-sensitive clones died. The surviving cells
repopulated and after 10 months, the cells dividing freely
in 10 nM and 100 nM docetaxel-containing media were
considered as resistant cell lines and labeled as “PC3-DR”
and “DU145-DR,” respectively.

Wound-healing assay
Cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates. After the
cells reached confluence, the cell layer was scratched with
a sterile P-200 pipette tip. The cells were then cultivated in
complete medium containing the indicated drugs for 24 h
before wound exposure.

Cell migration and invasion
Cell migration and invasion assays were performed
as previously described (8) using a modified transwell
chamber migration assay and invasion assay matrigelcoated membrane (BD Biosciences Bedford, MA). Briefly,
Approximately 1 × 104 cells suspended in serum-free
medium were plated in 24-well plates and treated with the
indicated drugs or AXL-siRNA. Twenty-four hours after
treatment, cell migration and invasion were measured as
per manufacturer’s instructions.

Cell growth and apoptosis assays
Proliferation assays were performed using Cell
Proliferation Kit I, MTT (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Apoptosis was
assessed using the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection
Kit (BioVision, Mountain View, CA, USA) and propidium
iodide (PI). Analysis was performed using a FACSCalibur
flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA).

In vivo study

Western blot analysis

All animal use and care protocols followed the
guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee and were approved by the Hospital of Nanjing
BenQ Medical Center Animal Care and Use Committee.
To generate docetaxel-resistant tumors, we injected 5 ×
106 DU145-DR cells into the flanks of 4-week-old male
athymic nude mice. After the tumors became palpable
(volume reached 100-150 mm3), 24 (six per group) tumorbearing mice were randomly picked and treated with the
following: MP470 (60 mg-1·kg-1·d for 14 days by oral
gavage), docetaxel (10 mg/kg given intraperitoneally
(i.p.) two days per week, for two consecutive weeks), or a
combination of both. The tumors resumed growth and six
randomly picked mice were treated with saline as control.
Tumor tissue was collected for analysis following standard
procedures. The tumor sizes and weight were monitored
for 6 weeks. Animal health was assessed daily to minimize
pain and distress.

Cells were serum-starved overnight and whole cell
lysates were prepared using the radioimmunoprecipitation
assay (RIPA) buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor
cocktail. Forty micrograms of total protein was resolved
by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to PVDF membranes.
The transferred proteins were immunoblotted with primary
polyclonal antibodies. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as the loading control.
The protein expression was quantified by densitometry,
using the Gel-Pro 32 software.

Transfection and siRNA technology
PC3 and DU145 cells were transiently transfected
with pcDNA-AXL or pcDNA-ABCB1 plasmids,
using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells

Briefly, following the respective treatments, the tissues
were fixed with 4.0% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed
3 times with PBS for 10 min each, blocked in 3% H2O2methanol for 10 min, and washed again with PBS. Then,
the sections were immunostained using antibodies diluted in
the blocking buffer, followed by the fluorophore-conjugated
secondary antibodies, and washed again with PBS. The
fluorescent DNA dye DAPI (4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)
