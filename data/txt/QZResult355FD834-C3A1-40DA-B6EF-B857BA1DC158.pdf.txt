ABSTRACT
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) have shown promising clinical efficacy in non-squamous non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC); however, resistance is frequently observed in malignant cells,
operating through a mechanism that remains largely unknown. The present study
shows that T-lymphokine-activated killer cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK) is
upregulated in NSCLC and excessively activated in TKI-refractory cells. TOPK dictates
the responsiveness of lung cancers to the EGFR-targeted TKI gefitinib through the
transcription factor AP-1 component c-Jun. TOPK binds directly to and phosphorylates
c-Jun, which consequently activates the transcription of AP-1 target genes, including
CCND1 and CDC2. TOPK silencing sensitizes EGFR-TKI-resistant lung cancer cells to
gefitinib and increases gefitinib efficacy in preclinical lung adenocarcinoma xenograft
models. These findings represent a novel mechanism of lung cancer resistance to
TKIs and suggest that TOPK may have value both as a predictive biomarker and as a
therapeutic target: TOPK-targeted therapy may synergize with EGFR-targeted therapy
in lung cancers.

INTRODUCTION

temporarily effective TKI treatment [3, 4]. Investigation of
the molecular events that determine the response of lung
cancer cells to TKIs is in progress to devise strategies to
overcome resistance [5, 6].
Three molecular mechanisms of EGFR-TKI
resistance are reported: the EGFR T790M gatekeeper
mutation[2], activation of bypass signaling [7-9], and
activation of downstream signaling [10, 11]. Activation
of downstream signaling includes PI3K/AKT signaling
activation, usually caused by loss of PTEN [10], and
MAPK signaling activation, usually caused by ERK2
activation [11], EML4-ALK mutation [12], BRAF
mutation [13] or KRAS mutation [14]. The present study
found that upregulation of T-lymphokine-activated killer

Lung cancer with distal metastasis has an extremely
high mortality rate [1]. Compared with the limited efficacy
of traditional chemo- and radiotherapy in combination
with surgery, molecular targeted chemicals, particularly
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), have emerged as
potent anticancer agents and have significantly improved
the prognosis of lung cancer patients with EGFR
mutations [2]. Unfortunately, despite great progress in
the treatment of lung cancer, resistance to EGFR-TKIs
commonly occurs, leading to a modest response rate to
first-line TKI therapy or to frequent recurrence after

RESULTS

cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK), a serine/threonine
protein kinase, is a new mechanism of resistance to
gefitinib downstream of EGFR in NSCLC.
TOPK is frequently activated in several
malignancies [15]. TOPK overexpression was detected
in more than 60% of patients with lung cancer and
correlates with poor disease-free survival [16]; TOPK
also confers resistance of neoplastic cells to drug-induced
apoptosis, suggesting that TOPK plays an important role
in the occurrence and progression of cancers, probably by
phosphorylating a wide range of substrate proteins [17,
18]. TOPK phosphorylates MAPKs, including the c-Jun
N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 and ERK, and interacts with
p53 to repress transactivation of p21 during carcinogenesis
[19, 20]. The present study reveals that TOPK is highly
expressed in lung cancer but not in paraneoplastic tissues,
and that excessive TOPK confers resistance of cancer cells
to EGFR-TKIs.
The uncontrolled growth and division that is a
hallmark of malignant cells originates from intensification
of growth factor signaling, which ultimately activates
key transcription factors and drives the expression of
genes involved in biosynthesis, energy production and
cell cycle progression [21]. The activator protein 1 (AP1), which belongs to the class of basic leucine zipper
(bZIP) transcription factors, plays essential roles in
regulating genes involved in cell proliferation, survival,
migration and transformation [22]. AP-1 is assembled
by dimerization of Jun and Fos family members [22].
Of note is the c-Jun/c-Fos dimer, the overexpression
or hyperactivation of which is implicated in diverse
cancers [23]. Although the expression of c-Jun and c-Fos
is regulated both at the transcriptional and translational
levels, the activation of these proteins by posttranslational
modification is a common mechanism that allows rapid
alteration of gene expression in response to extracellular
signals [22, 23]. For example, various extracellular stimuli
can activate JNK, which subsequently phosphorylates
and activates c-Jun for target gene transcription [22,
24]. Given the extensive involvement of c-Jun/c-Fos in
gene expression and in diverse cellular processes, it is
of great importance to decipher the mechanism of their
activation in different cell signaling contexts. This study
revealed that TOPK can activate AP-1 by directly binding
to and phosphorylating c-Jun at serine 63 and 73, which
consequently promotes the expression of a cohort of genes
responsible for malignant cell division and survival.

TOPK expression correlates with TKI resistance
in lung cancer cells
To investigate the role of TOPK in the development
and progression of lung carcinomas, we first compared
the expression of TOPK in clinical specimens of lung
cancer and adjacent normal tissue, and detected significant
upregulation in malignant tissues compared to normal
tissues (Figure 1A, 1B). We next measured TOPK levels
in lung cancer cell lines with varied sensitivity to EGFRTKIs. We found that TOPK was overexpressed in EGFRTKI-resistant lines (Figure 1C, 1D), including calu-3,
H460, H441, H1975, H1650 and A549. TOPK expression
was much lower in EGFR-TKI responsive cell lines,
including H520 and H358. In addition, TOPK activation,
assessed by phospho-TOPK, was also much higher in
the resistant lines than in the responsive lines (Figure
1C, 1D), suggesting that TOPK may play a role in TKI
resistance. One of the molecular mechanisms of EGFRTKI resistance is activation of signaling downstream of
EGFR. In this study, we found in both A549 and H1975
cells that EGFR activation stimulated by EGF can be
blocked by the EGFR-TKI gefitinib; however, TOPK
phosphorylation occurred downstream of EGF/EGFR
and was only partially inhibited by gefitinib (Figure
1E). Therefore, excessive TOPK expression and activity
correlates with resistance to EGFR-TKIs in lung cancer
cells.
We next examined whether TOPK directly affected
the sensitivity of lung cancer cells to EGFR-TKIs.
TOPK was knocked down in lung cancer cells by short
hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) (Figure 2A). TOPK silencing
significantly inhibited the growth of both A549 and
H1975 cells, which were known to be refractory to EGFRTKI treatment (Figure 2B) [25, 26]. TOPK knockdown
enhanced gefitinib-induced inhibition of A549 cell growth
and colony formation (Figure 2 C & 2D). Conversely,
ectopic expression of TOPK in a TKI-sensitive lung
cancer cell line, H358, decreased the responsiveness to
gefitinib (Figure 2E) [25]. These data suggest that TOPK
plays an essential role in regulating the sensitivity of lung
cancer cells to EGFR-TKIs.

Molecular modeling suggests that TOPK interacts
with c-Jun
To dissect the signaling downstream of TOPK
responsible for cancer cell survival and division, we
assessed the activation of potential TOPK substrate
proteins, including ERK, JNK and c-Jun in EGFR-TKIresistant (A549 cells) and -responsive (H358 cells) lung
cancer cells [25]. Since TOPK and ERK phosphorylate

each other upon stimulation by EGF [27], elevated
phosphorylation of TOPK is accompanied by high-level
ERK phosphorylation in A549 cells (Figure 3A, 3B).
Unexpectedly, a significantly high level of phosphorylated
c-Jun, but not of its classical activator phospho-JNK, was
detected in EGFR-TKI-resistant cells, suggesting that
c-Jun is not activated by JNK in EGFR-TKI-resistant cells
(Figure 3A) but may be induced by TOPK either via direct
interaction or via an intermediate kinase [16].
The structures of TOPK and c-Jun have not
been characterized, hindering insights into regulatory
mechanisms and future rational drug design. To study
the interaction between TOPK and c-Jun, both protein
structures were first modeled by homology. The two
models were sufficiently equilibrated and refined within
10 ns, with good stereochemical features (Figures S1
and S2), to be suitable to study interactions. The TOPKc-Jun complex reached equilibrium at approximately 30
ns (Figure 3B). Hence, the structural analysis is based on
the average structure of the 30.0–50.0 ns MD trajectories.
The binding of TOPK with c-Jun is characterized by
strong electrostatic interaction networks, involving
residues TOPK:Glu180, c-Jun:Lys35, TOPK:Asp321
and c-Jun:Lys32, with the formation of six salt bridges
(Figure 3C). Seventeen H-bonds within the interfacial
surfaces stabilize the complex (Suppl. Table 1). In
addition, the polarity of the interface between TOPK and
c-Jun was assessed. Polar residues, especially Lys, Ser and
Glu, are likely to appear at the binding interface in high
presence ratios (12.31, 10.77 and 9.23 %); Lys and Ser, in
particular, are likely to make significant contributions to
binding (Suppl. Table 1). In accordance with our binding
model, seven c-Jun phosphorylation sites, residues Thr2,
Thr8, Ser58, Ser63, Ser73, Thr89 and Thr93, are covered
by TOPK and may be phosphorylated (Figure 3D). These
modeling results inform on the molecular interaction
between TOPK and c-Jun and may help shed light on
the biological roles of TOPK, but require validation by
immunoprecipitation and in vitro kinase assay.

TOPK to c-Jun accounted for c-Jun phosphorylation.
Indeed, an in vitro kinase assay indicated that radioactive
phosphorus (32P) was incorporated into c-Jun by active
TOPK, suggesting that TOPK catalyzes the specific
phosphorylation of c-Jun (Figure 5A). To identify the
phosphorylation sites, we mutated candidate residues, i.e.,
S63 or S73, by substituting alanine. Mutation of either
serine attenuated c-Jun phosphorylation, whereas mutation
of both decreased c-Jun phosphorylation dramatically
(Figure 5B). Further, we found that the levels of c-Jun
phosphorylation at both sites (S63 & S73) were increased
in EGFR-TKI-resistant lung cancer cells compared to
-responsive cells, supporting the involvement of TOPKmediated c-Jun phosphorylation in EGFR-TKI resistance
(Figure 3A). In addition, EGF stimulation resulted in
simultaneous TOPK and c-Jun phosphorylation, both
in HEK293 cells and H358 cells that expressed ectopic
TOPK (Figure 5C) and in EGFR-TKI-resistant A549 and
H1975 lung cancer cells that expressed high endogenous
TOPK (Figure 5D). However, the phosphorylation level
of c-Jun decreased dramatically in TOPK knockdown
compared with the parental A549 cells (Figure 5E). These
data confirm the phosphorylation of c-Jun by TOPK at
serine 63 and 73 during the development of resistance to
EGFR-targeted TKIs.

TOPK phosphorylation of c-Jun induces the
transcriptional activity of AP-1
The transcriptional activity of AP-1 is regulated by
the phosphorylation of its components, e.g., c-Jun and
c-Fos [24]. To test whether TOPK phosphorylation of
c-Jun affects AP-1 transcriptional activity, we generated
an AP-1 luciferase reporter construct and detected
abundant luciferase expression in HEK293 cells coexpressing c-Jun and TOPK upon exposure to EGF
(Figure 6A). Similarly, the mRNA expression levels
of CCND1 and CDC2, both of which are known AP-1
target genes, were significantly decreased in TOPK
knockdown compared to the parental lung cancer cells
(Figure 6B). The protein expression levels of cyclin D1
and Cdc2 were also significantly decreased after TOPK
silencing in lung cancer cells exposed to EGF (Figure
6C). These results reveal that TOPK phosphorylation of
c-Jun promotes the transcriptional activity of AP-1 in lung
cancer cells, thereby promoting lung cancer cell division
and proliferation (Figure 6D).

TOPK directly binds to and phosphorylates c-Jun
in lung cancer cells
The predicted three-dimensional structures of
TOPK and c-Jun support a direct interaction model that
requires cell-based validation. To test whether TOPK
associates with c-Jun directly, we co-transfected HEK293
cells with HA-tagged TOPK and His-conjugated c-Jun.
Immunoprecipitation assays showed that the ectopically
expressed TOPK and c-Jun indeed interacted with each
other (Figure 4A). Similarly, endogenous TOPK coimmunoprecipitated with c-Jun in A549 cells, suggesting
that the two proteins could form a complex in EGFR-TKIresistant lung cancer cells (Figure 4B).
We next examined whether the direct binding of

of c-Jun phosphorylation by TOPK (Figure 7E). These
results indicate that TOPK plays an essential role in the
responsiveness of lung cancers to EGFR-TKIs in vivo.

enhancement of autophosphorylation of TOPK and
resulted in its activation at an early stage of mitosis [39],
so this is a positive feedback between TOPK and CDC2
according to our study.
The activator protein 1 (AP-1), predominantly
composed of c-Jun and c-Fos, plays a critical role in the
transcriptional regulation of a class of genes involved
in cell survival, proliferation and differentiation [22,
24]. Overexpression of c-Jun and c-Fos underlies the
development of various carcinomas, including pulmonary
malignancies [22, 40], and commonly occurs in concert
with the activation or stabilization of c-Jun by JNK,
ERK and RhoC in response to various extracellular
stimuli, including cytokines, growth factors and adhesion
molecules, respectively [24]. Rather than through these
canonical signaling pathways that regulate c-Jun, we
established here that c-Jun is directly phosphorylated
and activated by TOPK in EGFR-TKI-refractory lung
cancer cells, leading to the transcriptional activation of
AP-1 target genes such as CCND1 and CDC2 [41, 42].
Consequently, they may counteract TKIs by relieving
cell cycle arrest induced by attenuated EGFR signaling.
These findings are consistent with previous reports
that CCND1 and CDC2 are highly expressed in lung
adenocarcinoma, and that CDC2 is reported to predict bad
prognosis in advanced NSCLC and may be a therapeutic
target for advanced NSCLC patients [40, 43, 44]. In light
of a previous report showing that the EGFR signaling
pathway can promote AP-1 transcriptional activity [45],
TOPK-induced activation of AP-1 may represent a critical
mechanism to maintain AP-1 transcriptional activity upon
suppression of EGFR activity by TKIs. While the levels
of phosphorylated JNK were similar and very low among
the TKI-sensitive and -resistant lung cancer cell lines
tested, our study does not exclude the possibility of AP-1
regulation by ERK1/2. ERK2 and TOPK phosphorylate
each other upon exposure to EGF in colorectal cancer [25].
We also found that in EGFR-TKI-resistant A549 cells,
elevated phosphorylation of TOPK was accompanied by
high-level ERK1/2 phosphorylation compared to EGFRTKI-sensitive H358 cells. This means that ERK1/2 may
also be involved in driving EGFR-TKI resistance in lung
cancer.
TOPK correlates with cell transformation and
poor prognosis in various malignancies [15]. TOPK also
confers resistance to chemotherapy and to proapoptotic
ligands such as TRAIL [17, 18]. The multifaceted
functions of TOPK are reflected in the growing list of
known TOPK partners and substrates including p53,
ERK2, peroxiredoxin 1 (Prx1) and the p38α-specific
phosphatase MKP1 [20, 27, 46, 47]. TOPK maintains NFκB activity by phosphorylating IκBα, which is implicated
in the resistance of cervical cancer to doxorubicin [17].
Intriguingly, TOPK also binds to and phosphorylates
JNK1, a classical regulator of c-Jun activity [48]; however,
it is unlikely in our study that TOPK activates c-Jun by

DISCUSSION
Cell behaviors, including malignant transformation
and drug resistance, are governed by intracellular signals
originating from either outside or inside the cell [28].
Protein kinases, e.g., receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)
that couple extracellular growth stimuli with intracellular
signal transduction, play key roles in mediating signals that
culminate in cell growth and division [29]. EGFR, which
is frequently overexpressed or constitutively activated
upon mutation, triggers the occurrence and progression
of lung cancers [2]. Consequently, a class of TKIs
targeting EGFR has emerged and contributed critically
to clinical therapy in pulmonary malignancies [4]. The
benefit of these drugs is limited by the fact that most
patients inevitably develop resistance, i.e., machineries
that circumvent the cytotoxicity of these EGFR-TKIs [30,
31]. Although the mechanisms underlying TKI resistance
in lung cancers are diverse, the activation of downstream
signaling pathways that converge with the EGFR pathway
to activate the transcription of proliferation-related genes
represents the predominant molecular event in EGFRTKI-resistant neoplastic cells [5, 30, 31]. Indeed, we found
that TOPK was significantly upregulated and profoundly
activated in lung cancer cells that exhibited resistance to
EGFR-TKIs. The activation of EGFR with the treatment
of EGF in lung cancer cells was positively correlated with
the phosphorylation of TOPK. TOPK phosphorylates and
inactivates PTEN, which in turn activates Akt that leads
to proper G2/M progression [32]. TOPK/PBK promotes
cell migration via phosphorylating AKT at Ser (473) and
decreasing PTEN levels. LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, did
not inhibit the TOPK-induced decrease in PTEN. These
results indicate that the TOPK-mediated PTEN decrease
has an upstream role in regulating PI3K/AKT-stimulated
migration [33]. With EGF treatment, TOPK and ERK2 can
phosphorylate each other, and lead to a positive feedback
loop between TOPK and ERK2 in colorectal cancer [27].
Whereas TOPK can be activated by EGFR
signaling, the insufficiency of EGFR-targeted TKIs to
abrogate TOPK activation implies either the redundancy
of TOPK with upstream EGFR signaling elements or the
existence of alternative signaling pathways that elicit
the phosphorylation and activation of TOPK. Actually,
TOPK is upregulated upon activation of insulin-like
growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling [34]. It is reported to be
the target gene of Hippo-YAP signaling [35] and EWSFLI1pathway [36]. Expression of TOPK is regulated by
cell cycle-specific transcription factors c-Myc, E2F [37]
and CREB/ATF [38]. CDC2/cyclin B1 can inactivate
protein phosphatase 1 alpha (PP1alpha) and caused

phosphorylating JNK, given that the levels of total JNK
and phospho-JNK were very low among the EGFR-TKIsensitive and -resistant cell lines. The modeling studies
supported a direct association between TOPK and c-Jun.
Further studies confirmed interaction by showing that
TOPK coimmunoprecipitates with c-Jun in A549 cells,
and that c-Jun was phosphorylated by TOPK in an in vitro
kinase assay. However, further investigation is needed
to determine whether other proteins, e.g., transcriptional
factors or the aforementioned TOPK substrates, are also
involved in the TOPK-mediated TKI resistance of lung
cancers. The systematic analysis of gene profiles affected
by TOPK and c-Jun will provide a clear depiction of the
integrated regulatory network underlying lung cancer
resistance to EGFR-TKIs.
Accumulating evidence suggests that EGFR-TKI
resistance arises from diverse genetic alterations and
is characterized by a malignant cell population with
apparent heterogeneity [31]. The EGFR mutant T790M,
found in lung cancers with very high prevalence, can
circumvent suppression by TKIs [49]. Gene amplifications
or mutations that cause alternative growth factor receptor
signaling, e.g., signaling downstream of the human
epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family, hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF)/c-Met or insulin-like growth factor
1 receptor (IGF1R), confer resistance of cancer cells to
EGFR-targeted TKIs [30, 31]. Mutations resulting in
constitutively active kinases or transcriptional factors
such as anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), PI3K, MAPK
and JAK/STATs, or mutations altering the levels of cell
survival regulators, e.g., the pro-apoptotic protein BIM,
also underlie the acquisition of TKI resistance [30, 31,
50]. Although we found that TOPK alone is sufficient to
desensitize lung cancer cells to TKIs, extensive crosstalk
between TOPK and the aforementioned canonical
machinery of EGFR-TKI resistance may also exist [16,
30]. To this end, genome-wide screening of TKI-resistant
neoplastic cells will help identify the genetic variations
underlying TOPK overexpression and activation, and will
help determine whether TOPK acts as a driver or mediator
of EGFR-TKI resistance in human lung carcinomas [51].
Nevertheless, our study provides novel insights into the
mechanism of TKI resistance, and thus suggests that
TOPK may be a suitable therapeutic target for overcoming
EGFR-TKI resistance in lung carcinomas. In future, small
molecule TOPK inhibitors should be developed to enhance
lung cancer treatment efficacy with EGFR-TKIs.

against PBK/TOPK, phospho-PBK/TOPK (Thr7), c-Jun
and CDC2 were purchased from Abcam Corporation
(Cambridge, MA, US). Antibodies against TOPK, EGFR,
phospho-EGFR (Tyr1068), phospho-c-Jun (Ser63),
phospho-c-Jun (Ser73), ERK1/2, phospho-ERK (Thr202/
Tyr204), JNK, phospho-JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) and cyclin
D1 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology
(Beverly, MA, US). The JetPEI reagent was purchased
from Qbiogene (Montreal, Quebec, Canada) and EGF
from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA, US).

Immunofluorescent staining
The lung adenocarcinoma tissue array slide was
blocked with 5% donkey serum albumin in 600 μ1
phosphate-buffered saline/0.03% Triton X-100, (pH 6.0)
in a humidified chamber for 1 h at room temperature and
then were immunostained with 1:100 anti-TOPK raised in
mouse (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 1:200 donkey antimouse IgG conjugated to Cy2 (Jackson ImmunoResearch
Laboratories). Image stacks were captured (×20) at room
temperature using laser scanning confocal microscopy
(NIKON Clsi Confocal Spectral Imaging System;
NIKON Instruments Co., Melville, NY). The intensity
of immunofluorescence was scored using EZ-C1 3.90
FreeViewer (NIKON).

Cell culture and transfection
The human lung cancer cell lines A549, H358,
H460, H520, H441, H1650, H1975 and Calu-3 were
purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). The human
embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cell line was obtained
from the Cell Bank of Shanghai Institute for Biological
Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences. All cell lines
were characterized by gene profiling by the providers, and
were propagated and frozen for future study after receipt.
Each vial of frozen cells was thawed and maintained in
culture for a maximum of 8 weeks. Enough frozen vials
were available for each cell line to ensure that all cellbased experiments were conducted on cells that had been
tested and in culture for 8 weeks or less.
Lung cancer cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 or
DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) and maintained at 37°C in a humidified
incubator with 5% CO2. The cultures were split at 90%
confluence, and the media were changed every 2 days.
When cultures reached 50‒60% confluence, transfection
was performed using JetPEI following the manufacturer’s
suggested protocol. The cells were cultured for 36‒48 h,
and then proteins were extracted for further analysis.

Cell proliferation and cytotoxicity assay

Anchorage-independent cell growth

For cell proliferation assay, cells (500 /well) were
seeded into 96-well plates and incubated at 37°C with 5%
CO2. After incubation for 24h, 48h or 72h, 10 μL of CCK8 solution (Shanghai R&S Biotechnology Co., Ltd) was
added and then incubated for 1 hour at 37°C with 5% CO2.
Absorbance was measured at 450 nm in a plate reader. For
cytotoxicity assay, cells were seeded into 96-well plates at
an initial density of 5×103 cells /well and cultured for 12
h, and then stimulated with increased concentrations of
gefitinib for additional 48 h. Cell viability was assessed
using CCK-8 solution and absorbance was measured at
450 nm.

A549 cells (8×103 per well of 6-well plate)
suspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS were
added to 0.3% agar containing different concentrations
of gefitinib (top layer) over a base layer of 0.6% agar.
These soft-agar cultures were maintained at 37°C in 5%
CO2 for 3 weeks and then colonies were counted under
a microscope using the Image-Pro Plus software (v.4)
program (Media Cybernetics).

Modeling studies
According to previous reports [52-54], the 3D
structures of the TOPK (accession number: Q96KB5)
and c-Jun (accession number: NP_002219) proteins
were built using the MODELER module in the InsightII
2005 software package [54, 55]. The protein structures
generated were adequately equilibrated by MD simulation
using the GROMACS4.5.5 program [56] and Charmm27
force field [57], as recommended previously [54, 58]. The
docking simulations were performed using the ZDOCK
and RDOCK modules within InsightII 2005 [59-61].
The optimally docked complex was selected on the basis
of energy and size of cluster, and then optimized using
the conjugated gradient algorithm with a convergence
criterion of 0.01 kcal·mol-1·Å-1. The energy-minimized
docked complex was sufficiently equilibrated by 50.0
ns MD simulations using the GROMACS4.5.5 program
[56] and Charmm27 force field [57]. Details of the MD
simulation setup are consistent with previously published
work [58].

Tissue array
A human lung cancer tissue array (U.S. Biomax,
Rockville, MD) was prepared and analyzed according to
the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The samples
were blocked in 5% goat serum albumin in 600 μL
1×phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with
0.03% Triton X-100 (pH 6.0) in a humidified chamber
for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with
TOPK antibody (1:100 dilution in 500 μL 1×PBS/0.03%
Triton X-100 (pH 6.0)) at 4°C in a humidified chamber
overnight. The slides were washed and hybridized for 2
h with secondary antibody conjugated to Cy2 (Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) (1:200
dilution) at room temperature in the dark. Slides were
washed in PBS (2×5 min). The expression of TOPK was
observed by laser scanning confocal microscopy (NIKON
C1si Confocal Spectral Imaging System; NIKON
Instruments Co., Melville, NY).

In vitro kinase assay

Lentiviral infection

To detect γ-32P incorporation, 2 μg wild-type His-cJun and mutant c-Jun were mixed separately with active
TOPK (0.2 μg/50-μL reaction; Cell Signaling, Danver,
MA) in 5× kinase buffer containing 10 μM unlabeled ATP
and 10 μCi [γ-32P] ATP (New England Biolabs, Ipswich,
MA) and incubated at 30°C for 30 min. The reaction was
stopped by the addition of 6× SDS loading buffer. Samples
were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and γ-32P-labeled wildtype or mutant c-Jun was visualized by autoradiography or
Coomassie blue staining.

The lentiviral expression vectors, including GipzshTOPK, and packaging vectors, including pMD2.0G
and psPAX, were purchased from Addgene (Cambridge,
MA). To prepare TOPK viral particles, each viral vector
and packaging vectors (pMD2.0G and psPAX) were
transfected into 293T cells using JetPEI following the
manufacturer’s suggested protocols. The transfection
medium was replaced 4 h after transfection and then cells
were cultured for 36 h. The viral particles were harvested,
filtered using a 0.45-µm syringe filter, combined with 8
μg/mL polybrene (Millipore, Boston, MA), added to 60%
confluent A549 lung cancer cells, and incubated overnight.
The cell culture medium was replaced with fresh complete
growth medium for 24 h and then cells were selected with
puromycin (8.0 μg/mL) for 36 h. The selected cells were
used in experiments.

AP-1 activity assay
HEK293 cells stably transfected with an AP-1
luciferase reporter plasmid were transfected with
pcDNA4-wt-c-jun or pcDNA3.1A-TOPK plasmid, and
then the cells were further transiently transfected with the
PRL-SV40 plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI). Cells were
starved in 0.1% FBS-DMEM for 24 h, after which they

were stimulated with EGF (10 ng/mL) for 12 h. Then,
the cells were disrupted with lysis buffer and luciferase
activity was measured using a luminometer (Monolight
2010, San Diego, CA).

BALB/c nude mice (Institute of Zoology, Chinese
Academy of Sciences) that were 4‒6 weeks old were
challenged subcutaneously with lung cancer A549 cells
modified with a control lentiviral construct (A549shmock)
and those modified to express TOPK-targeted shRNA
(A549shTOPK) (1×107) to allow tumor development.
When palpable tumors (approximately 100 mm3)
arose, the mice in each group were randomly allocated
to treatment groups of five animals: (1) no treatment
(control) or (2) gefitinib (25 mg/kg/d) by oral gavage.
Tumor growth was monitored by caliper measurements
of the two perpendicular diameters every 3 days, and the
volume of the tumor was calculated with the formula V
= (width2×length/2). All procedures were performed in
compliance with the Regulations for the Administration
of Affairs Concerning Experimental Animals (approved
by the State Council of the People’s Republic of China)
and were approved by the Experimental Animal Ethics
Committee of Fourth Military Medical University.

Quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cells using the
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen/Life Technologies) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Reverse transcription was
performed using SuperScriptTM II reverse transcriptase
(Invitrogen/Life Technologies), and cDNAs were
amplified and detected using the SYBR Premix Ex TaqTM
(TaKaRa, Dalian, China). The primers used for PCR
were as follows: 5’-GATCATTGCTCCTCCTGAGC-3’
and
5’-ACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCAC-3’
for
β-actin, 5’-TGTGCATCTACACCGACAAC-3’ and
5’-AGGAAGTGTTCAATGAAATCGT-3’for CCND1,
and 5’-AAAATTGGAGAAGGTACCTATGGA-3’and
5’-CCCTTCCTCTTCACTTTCTAGTCTG-3’ for CDC2.

Western blotting

Statistical analysis

Cells were harvested, and proteins were extracted,
separated on an SDS/PAGE gel, transferred onto PVDF
membranes and subjected to immunoblot analyses.
Blotting was performed using antibodies targeting TOPK
(1:500), phosphorylated TOPK (pTOPK, 1:500), c-Jun
(1:500), p-c-Jun (Ser63, 1:500), p-c-Jun (Ser73, 1:500),
ERK (1:500), pERK (1:500), JNK (1:500), pJNK (1:500),
cyclin D1 (1:250), Cdc2 (1:500) and β-actin (1:1000,
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).

Statistical significance was assessed by comparing
mean (± SD) values with Student’s t-test for independent
groups. P ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
