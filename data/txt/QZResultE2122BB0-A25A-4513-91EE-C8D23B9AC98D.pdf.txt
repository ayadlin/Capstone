ABSTRACT
Chemokine receptor CXCR4 is a key factor for tumor growth and metastasis
in several types of human cancer. This study investigated the feasibility of CXCR4directed imaging of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with positron emission tomography/
computed tomography (PET/CT) using the radiolabelled chemokine ligand [68Ga]
Pentixafor.
10 patients with primarily diagnosed (n=3) or pre-treated (n=7) SCLC (n=9)
or large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung (LCNEC, n=1) underwent
[68Ga]Pentixafor-PET/CT. 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([18F]FDG, n=6) and/
or somatostatin receptor (SSTR)-directed PET/CT with [68Ga]DOTATOC (n=5) and
immunohistochemistry (n=10) served as standards of reference.
CXCR4-PET was positive in 8/10 patients and revealed more lesions with
significantly higher tumor-to-background ratios than SSTR-PET. Two patients who were
positive on [18F]FDG-PET were missed by CXCR4-PET, in the remainder [68Ga]Pentixafor
detected an equal (n=2) or higher (n=2) number of lesions. CXCR4 expression of
tumor lesions could be confirmed by immunohistochemistry.
Non-invasive imaging of CXCR4 expression in SCLC is feasible. [68Ga]Pentixafor
as a novel PET tracer might serve as readout for confirmation of CXCR4 expression as
prerequisite for potential CXCR4-directed treatment including receptor-radio(drug)
peptide therapy.

INTRODUCTION

time, high growth fraction, and the early development of
metastases. Only one-third of patients are diagnosed with
localized disease, and treatment strategies have focused on
systemic therapy [2]. Although SCLC is highly responsive
to both chemotherapy and radiotherapy, it commonly
relapses within months despite treatment [3, 4]. Response
rates to second-line treatments have been reported to
range between 10-20% [5]. Thus, new treatment options

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a neuroendocrine
tumor that represents 15% of all lung cancers [1]. It occurs
predominantly in smokers as almost all patients have a
history of tobacco use.
SCLC is distinguished clinically from most other
types of non-small cell lung cancer by its rapid doubling

including personalized medicine targeting specific
molecular markers are urgently needed.
Chemokine receptor CXCR4 has been described to
play a pivotal role in tumor growth and progression, tumor
invasiveness and metastasis [6]. Overexpression of the
receptor has been reported in more than 30 different types
of cancer, including lymphoma, breast, pancreatic, ovarian
and lung cancer [7-10]. In SCLC, almost ubiquitous
CXCR4 overexpression has been shown to correlate with
negative outcome [11].
Recently, a radiolabelled CXCR4-ligand ([68Ga]
Pentixafor) for PET imaging has been developed [12,
13]. Dosimetry and proof-of-concept for visualization
of CXCR4-expression has recently been demonstrated
in patients with hematologic malignancies [14, 15],
glioblastoma [16] and myocardial infarction [17, 18].
This is the first report of non-invasive detection
of CXCR4-expression in SCLC patients. CXCR4 may
serve as a promising new target for both diagnostic and
therapeutic interventions, especially in selecting potential
candidates for endoradiotherapy.

Clinical findings
8/10 patients presented with extended disease, 2
subjects with limited disease. Metastatic sites included
lymph nodes (9/10), adrenals (4/10), liver (4/10), pleura
(3/10), bone (2/10), and brain (1/10). Intrapulmonary
metastases were detected in (3/10) subjects, 1 patient
suffered from leptomeningeal tumor spread. All pretreated
patients had undergone chemotherapy with cisplatin and
etoposide. At the time point of imaging, only 2/10 patients
were currently on treatment. Patient #2 had started
combined radio-chemotherapy 14 days prior to [68Ga]Pentixafor-PET. In patient #5, chemotherapy had been
initiated 9 days earlier.

depicted only 20 foci (lymph nodes, n = 14; adrenals, n
= 2; brain, n = 2; pleura, n = 1; lungs, n = 1). The 35
lesions exclusively visualized by [68Ga]Pentixafor
were lymphonodal (n = 19), hepatic (n = 9), pleural (n =
5) and CNS (n = 2) manifestations of origin; 16 of those
were present in the two CXCR4-positive/SSTR-negative
subjects.
In comparison to [18F]FDG (44 lesions), CXCR4directed PET visualized 33 tumor manifestations. 23 foci
were missed in the two [18F]FDG-positive/[68Ga]Pentixafor
-negative patients. In the remaining 4 subjects, CXCR4PET detected 26 lymph node (vs. [18F]FDG: n = 15), 3
adrenal (vs. [18F]FDG: n = 3), 3 lung (vs. [18F]FDG: n =
3), and 1 liver (vs. [18F]FDG: n = 0) lesions/metastases
(Figure 2).
On semi-quantitative analysis, the median
SUVmean of the primary tumors was 6.9 (range, 2.611.3) and the median SUVmax was 8.8 (range, 4.8-15.5).
The corresponding SUVmean for [68Ga]DOTATOC
and [18F]FDG were 5.6 (range, 2.7-8.5) and 7.1
(range, 3.1-24.6), respectively; those for SUVmax 9.1
(range, 4.7-13.5; [68Ga]DOTATOC) and 9.9 (range,
4.7-38.1; [18F]FDG). The respective value for the
hottest metastatic lesion in [68Ga]Pentixafor-PET
were 7.5 (range, 3.0-14.1) for SUVmean and 10.0 (range,
6.5-19.4) for SUVmax, respectively. This compared to
9.4 (range, 8.9-9.9; [68Ga]DOTATOC) and 7.0 (range,
3.4-15.5; [18F]FDG) for SUVmean and for SUVmax to 17.6
(range, 16.7-18.5; [68Ga]DOTATOC) and 11.2 (range,
4.9-19.3; [18F]FDG). Tumor-to-background ratios were
significantly higher for [68Ga]Pentixafor than for [68Ga]
DOTATOC regarding the primary tumor as well as the

hottest metastatic lesion with a median P/Bmean of 5.4
(range, 1.3-7.5) vs. 0.7 (range, 0.3-1.0) and a median P/Bmax
of 3.7 (range, 1.8-5.1) vs. 0.7 (range, 0.4-1.0). Median M/
Bmean ratios were 5.5 (range, 2.4-12.9) vs. 1.2 (range, 1.11.2) and median M/Bmax ratios were 3.2 (range, 2.4-8.3) vs.
1.5 (range, 1.3-1.6), respectively. [68Ga]Pentixafor ratios
were comparable to [18F]FDG (median P/Bmean, 3.0; range,
1.4-8.6; median P/Bmax, 3.2; range, 1.4-8.7; median M/
Bmean, 4.1; range, 1.5-6.7; median M/Bmax, 3.5; range, 1.58.6). The individual SUV and tumor-to-background values
for CXCR4 are given in Supplementary Table 1.

Immunohistochemistry
In all patients imaging results could be compared to
immunohistological staining for SSTR2a/5 and CXCR4
derived from biopsies of the primary tumor (n = 6) or
metastases (n = 4) (Figure 3). Regarding the histological
evaluation of CXCR4 expression, 1/10 samples was
rated “mild” (IRS 3), 6/10 “moderate” (4 IRS 4, 2 IRS
8) and 2/10 “strongly” (1 IRS 10, 1 IRS 12) positive. The
remaining sample (patient #5) was scored negative. In
comparison, 5/10 samples did not show any SSTR2a/5
expression (all IRS 0), and 5/10 were moderately (all IRS
4) positive (Table 1).
Immunohistological CXCR4 score did not
correspond to the intensity of [68Ga]Pentixafor uptake
(SUVmean, SUVmax, TBRmean, TBRmax). Interestingly, two
patients (#2, #6) had no detectable CXCR4-expression
by PET/CT, whereas receptor expression was maximal
on all tumor cells (IRS 10 and 12, respectively). Patient

examples of immunohistochemical expression of CXCR4 and SSTR2a and 5, respectively. Patient #3 had his biopsy taken from a lymph
node metastasis demonstrating a weak staining for CXCR4 in 90% of the tumor cells (IRS 4). SSTR2a was negative, SSTR5 could also
be demonstrated to be weakly expressed in 90% (IRS 4). Patient #9 also presented with extensive disease. Biopsy of the primary tumor
revealed mild CXCR4 (intensity 1+ in 70% of the cells, IRS 3) and mild SSTR2a (intensity 1+ in 90%; IRS 4) expression. SSTR5 was
negative in the sample.The inserts depict maximum intensity projections are the respective whole-body [68Ga]Pentixafor- and SSTRdirected PET/CT scans, respectively.

Table 1: Patients' characteristics

All patients with relapsed disease had undergone 1st- and/or 2nd-line treatment (patients #1, #3, #9). 1st-line treatment included
2-6 cycles of platinum/etoposide-containing chemotherapy (patient #1: 2 cycles, patients #3 and #9: 4 cycles, patients #4,
#6, #7 and #8: 6 cycles) (+radiotherapy), 2nd-line therapy had topotecan as the mainstay (all three patients [#1, #3 and #9]
received 6 cycles).
Bx = biopsy; CTx = chemotherapy; IRS = immunoreactive score; LCNEC = large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung;
LN = lymph node; N/A = not assessed; PD= primary diagnosis; RCTx = radio-chemotherapy; SCLC= small cell lung cancer;
Tx = treatment.
#6 had the biopsy sample taken from a cervical lymph
node 5 months prior to PET imaging and received 4
cycles of carboplatin and etoposide in the interim;
patient #2 had started radio-chemotherapy 14 days
prior to PET-imaging. The other patient receiving
chemotherapy (patient #5, therapy initiated 9 days prior
to PET imaging) presented with negative histology
for CXCR4 but positive [68Ga]Pentixafor-PET.

well as a lesion basis, underlining the potential superiority
of CXCR4 as a therapeutic target compared to SSTR.
Recently, a derivative of the diagnostic compound
allowing labelling with various α- and β-emitters called
Pentixather has been developed. Proof-of-concept for
endoradiotherapy could be demonstrated in patients with
advanced multiple myeloma with partial and complete
metabolic responses [22]. Thus, further assessment of this
promising tool in a theranostic approach is warranted.
This pilot study has several limitations. First, only
a limited number of patients could be included in the
study. Second, biopsies were not always obtained on
a short-term period compared to the time point of PET
imaging and re-biopsies could not always be acquired.
[68Ga]Pentixafor uptake did not seem to correlate with
histological receptor expression, maybe due to receptor
kinetics and internalization. Of note, receptor surface
expression of CXCR4 seems to be a dynamic process
which is influenced by a number of factors including
therapeutic agents. The patient demonstrating the highest
CXCR4 expression in her sample analyzed (patient #6)
presented with a negative [68Ga]Pentixafor PET after
concurrent 1st line chemotherapy. In addition, another
patient (patient #2) with recently diagnosed SCLC also did
not exhibit high receptor expression on PET after initiation
of combined radio-chemotherapy two weeks earlier.
Therefore, one might speculate that surface expression
of CXCR4 is downregulated as a response to treatment
in a time and dose dependent manner. In line with this
observation is the fact that another subject (patient #5)
showed intermediate SUV and no immunohistochemical
CXCR4-positivity after a nine-day-duration of
chemotherapy. While high expression of CXCR4 in SCLC
has recently been demonstrated [11], future studies to
further investigate therapy-induced down- and -preferablyup-regulation of CXCR4 are warranted. Potentially a
sequential combination with chemotherapeutic agents
with might lead to improved efficacy of CXCR4-directed
endoradiotherapy.

DISCUSSION
This is the first report of in vivo imaging of CXCR4
expression in humans with both newly diagnosed as well
as pre-treated, recurrent SCLC. A recent report evaluating
biopsy samples of bronchopulmonary neuroendocrine
tumors demonstrated a high intensity of CXCR4 receptor
expression in SCLC. Additionally, chemokine receptor
expression was a predictor of poor overall survival [11].
In concordance, moderate to high receptor density on the
cell surface was visualized by PET/CT in our cohort in the
vast majority of cases.
Of note, in comparison to [18F]FDG-PET/CT
as reference, almost all tumor lesions proved to be
CXCR4-positive with high tumor-to-background
ratios, thus rendering CXCR4 a promising target for
endoradiotherapy. Given the high relapse rate of SCLC
after 1st line chemotherapy as well as the modest response
rates to subsequent treatments, a new approach to the
patient with relapsed/refractory SCLC is urgently needed.
In addition to conventional chemotherapeutic agents
including anthracycline-based regimes, topotecan or
amrubicin [19], peptide receptor radionuclide therapy
using radiolabelled somatostatin receptor ligands has
been performed with rather modest success rates [20,
21]. Important prerequisites to receptor-targeted therapies
are a robust expression of the target receptor as well as a
specific receptor binding. In our patient cohort, CXCR4PET/CT clearly outperformed SSTR-PET on a patient as

In conclusion, our data demonstrate the feasibility of
[68Ga]Pentixafor for PET imaging of CXCR4 chemokine
receptor expression in SCLC patients. This novel PET
tracer might serve as an innovative imaging agent for in
vivo biomarker identification that could result in patient
selection for CXCR4-directed treatment, and, eventually,
for receptor-radio(drug)peptide therapy.

endotoxins.
[18F]FDG was synthesized in house with a 16
MeV Cyclotron (GE PETtrace 6; GE Healthcare,
Milwaukee, USA). [68Ga]DOTATOC was prepared using
a modification of the method described by Breeman et al.
[24] using a SCINTOMICS radiotracer synthesis module
(Scintomics, Fürstenfeldbruck, Germany).
All PET scans ([18F]FDG, [68Ga]DOTATOC and
68
[ Ga]Pentixafor) were performed on a dedicated PET/CT
scanner (Siemens Biograph mCT 64; Siemens Medical
Solutions, Germany) within two weeks. Before acquisition
of FDG-PET scans, patients fasted for at least 6 h prior to
injection of [18F]FDG. Blood glucose levels were < 160
mg/dl. Prior to [68Ga]DOTATOC and [68Ga]Pentixafor
scans, no fasting was necessary. Imaging was perfomed
60 minutes after injection of 124 to 149 MBq (median,
142 MBq) of [68Ga]Pentixafor, 229 to 304 MBq (median,
297 MBq) of [18F]FDG and 120 to 164 MBq (median, 157
MBq) of [68Ga]DOTATOC, respectively. Corresponding
CT low-dose scans for attenuation correction were
acquired using a low-dose protocol (20 mAs, 120 keV,
a 512 × 512 matrix, 5 mm slice thickness, increment of
30 mm/s, rotation time of 0.5 s, and pitch index of 0.8)
including the base of the skull to the proximal thighs.
Consecutively, PET emission data were acquired in threedimensional mode with a 200 × 200 matrix with 2-3 min
emission time per bed position. After decay and scatter
correction, PET data were reconstructed iteratively with
attenuation correction using a dedicated software (Siemens
Esoft, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects and study design
From January to September 2015, 10 patients
(5 males and 5 females, mean age, 62±12 years:
range, 38-79 years) with newly diagnosed (n =
3) or pretreated (n = 7) SCLC (n = 9) or large
cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) (n = 1)
underwent
imaging
with
[68Ga]Pentixafor-PET.
Routine staging or restaging examinations included
[18F]FDG (n = 6) or somatostatin receptor (SSTR)
-directed PET with [68Ga]DOTATOC (n = 5; the latter for
identification of candidates for SSTR-directed therapy).
Patients` characteristics are given in more detail in Table
1.
[68Ga]Pentixafor was administered on a
compassionate use basis in compliance with §37 of the
Declaration of Helsinki and The German Medicinal
Products Act, AMG §13 2b and in accordance with the
responsible regulatory body (Regierung von Oberfranken).
The study adhered to the standards established in the
declaration of Helsinki. All patients gave written informed
consent prior to imaging.

Image analysis
All PET scans were first visually rated by a boardcertified nuclear medicine physician in a binary visual
fashion as positive for disease or negative for disease.
Semi-quantitative analysis was performed for the primary
as well as the hottest metastatic lesion. The axial PET
image slice displaying the maximum tumor uptake was
selected by drawing a 3D-volume of interest (VOI)
around the whole tumor area. Tumor regions of interest
(ROIs) were defined in 2 ways. First, a standardized 10mm circular region was placed over the area with the
peak activity. This first ROI was used to derive maximum
(SUVmax) and mean standardized uptake values (SUVmean).
A reference region was defined by drawing a ROI
(diameter of 50 mm) involving normal liver parenchyma
to derive tumor-to-background ratios. Both primary-tobackground (P/B) as well as metastasis-to-background
(M/B) ratios for SUVmax and SUVmean were calculated. The
radiotracer concentration in the ROIs was normalized to
the injected dose per kilogram of patient’s body weight to
derive the SUVs.

Imaging
[68Ga]Pentixafor was prepared as previously
described [23]. In short, all syntheses were performed in a
fully automated, GMP-compliant procedure using a GRP®
module (SCINTOMICS GmbH, Germany) equipped with
a disposable single-use cassette kit (ABX, Germany).
The eluate (68Ga3+ in 0.6 M HCl) of a 68Ge/68Ga-generator
(iThemba Labs, Faure, South Africa) was transferred
to a cation exchange cartridge, eluted with 5 N NaCl,
added to a solution of 40 µg Pentixafor (Scintomics,
Fürstenfeldbruck, Germany) in HEPES-buffer and heated
for 6 minutes at 125°C. The product was immobilized on
a SepPak C18-cartridge, washed with water und eluted
with ethanol/water 50/50. The eluate was passed through
a sterile filter (0.22 µm) into a sterile vial und diluted
with phosphate buffer solution to a total volume of 15
mL. Radiochemical purity was determined by gradient
high performance liquid chromatography and thin-layer
chromatography. Additionally, the product was also tested
for ethanol content, pH, radionuclide purity, sterility, and

Editorial note

Immunohistochemistry was carried out on 10%
formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections (3µm)
according to established protocols and scored as described
previously (13). CXCR4-immunohistochemistry was
performed using an anti-CXCR4 rabbit polyclonal
antibody (ab2074; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) followed by
detection with the DAKO en vision system according to
the manufacturer′s protocol.
For assessment of SSTR expression, polyclonal
antibodies against SSTR2A (1:500, RBK 046-05,
Zytomed, Berlin, Germany) and SSTR5 (1:500, RBK
051-05, Zytomed, Berlin, Germany) were used. Samples
from normal pancreatic tissue were used as positive
control (islet cells). Dewaxed samples were pretreated
with citrate buffer pH 6.0 for 10 minutes (for SSTR2a
staining) or with the antigen retrieval agent TIRS-EDTA
pH 9.0, respectively, for 10 minutes in a high pressure
cooker (for SSTR5 staining). All immunostained sections
were counterstained for 3 minutes with hematoxylin.
The analysis of the stained sections was done semiquantitatively by light-microscopy according to the
immunoreactive score (IRS) by Remmele and Stegner
[25]. The percentage of CXCR4-/SSTR-positive cells
was scored as follows: 0 (no positive cells), 1 ( < 10%
positive cells), 2 (10-50% positive cells), 3 ( > 50-80%
positive cells), 4 ( > 80% positive cells). Additionally, the
intensity of staining was graded: 0 (no color reaction), 1
(mild reaction), 2 (moderate reaction), 3 (intense reaction).
Multiplication of both scores for a given sample yields
the IRS classification: 0-1 (negative), 2-3 (mild), 4-8
(moderate), 9-12 strongly positive.
