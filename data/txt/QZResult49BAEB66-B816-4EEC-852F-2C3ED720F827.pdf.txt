ABSTRACT
Estrogen (E2) has been suggested to have a protective role in attenuating
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. miRNAs have great potential as
biomarkers and therapeutic agents owing to their ability to control gene expression.
However, little is known about the mechanism underlying the protective role of
E2 in hepatocarcinogenesis and the effects of E2 on apoptotic miRNAs expression.
Using miRNA PCR array, we found more than 2-fold alteration was observed in 25
upregulated and 10 downregulated apoptotic miRNAs in E2-treated cells. Among
these miRNAs, we found expression of miR-23a was related to p53 functional status
in the male-derived liver cell-lines. We demonstrated that E2 via ERα transcriptionally
activated miR-23a and p53 expression, and thus enhanced p53 activation of miR-23a
expression. Moreover, miR-23a expression correlated inversely with the expression
of target gene X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), but positively with the
caspase-3/7 activity. Decreasing of XIAP might contribute to caspase-3 activity and
cell apoptosis. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel E2-signaling mechanism
in regulating miRNAs expression for controlling apoptosis in liver cells. Delineating
the role of E2 in regulating the activation of p53 and miR-23a, expression in HCC is
crucial to the understanding of the sex difference observed in HCC.

protective role in female [4–6]. However, the mechanisms
governing these phenomena are largely unknown.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small
noncoding RNA molecules that regulate target genes
expression at the post-transcriptional level. They are
involved in stem cell self-renewal, cellular development,
proliferation, and apoptosis [7]. Growing evidence
indicates that miRNA is differentially expressed during
development of many types of cancer, including liver
cancer [8–10]. These findings suggest that miRNAs may
play an important role in carcinogenesis as a novel class
of oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes. Thus, miRNAs
have been considered as potential targets for cancer
therapy as well as diagnostic tools.
The homeostatic balance between cell proliferation
and cell death rate is critical for maintaining normal
physiological processes. Aberrant regulation of apoptotic
cell death mechanisms is one of the hallmarks of cancer
development and progression, and many cancer cells

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most
common malignant cancer and the third leading cause of
cancer-related death in the world. The development of
HCC is considered to be the most serious result of chronic
liver diseases, including viral hepatitis B and C, cirrhosis
due to other causes and alcoholic liver diseases [1].
Although the incidence of HCC worldwide is increasing
[2], our understanding of the underlying molecular
pathogenesis pathways in HCC is still limited.
Epidemiological data indicate that regardless of
etiology, the incidence of HCC is higher in males than
in females, with a male to female ratio ranging between
3–5 to 1 [3]. This sex difference is also found in the
development of cirrhosis. This favourable outcome in
female patients is attenuated after menopause [4]. Both
epidemiologic evidence and results from animal studies
have shown that estrogen (E2) may have a tumor

exhibit significant resistance to apoptosis signaling [11].
Increasing number of miRNAs have been implicated in
regulating cell death [12]. They either function as proapoptotic or anti-apoptotic miRNAs which regulate
target anti-apoptotic or pro-apoptotic mRNAs expression
respectively, and thus regulate cell apoptosis [13, 14].
Deregulation of these apoptotic-miRNAs might contribute
to the development of disease, including cancers. Recent
investigations have reported that miRNAs are involved
in E2 signaling pathway [15, 16]. We therefore speculate
that some of these miRNAs may contribute to the unique
gender disparity observed in HCC. Particularly, it will be
interesting to determine if E2 plays a role in regulating
specific apoptotic miRNA(s) expression, thus inhibiting
HCC development.
The aims of this study were to 1) evaluate the
effects of E2 on apoptotic miRNAs expression; 2)

explore the possible molecular mechanisms underlying
the differential expression of miR-23a observed in HCC
cells; and 3) identify whether E2-regulated miRNA-23a
subsequently control target genes expression and cell
apoptosis in HCC.

RESULTS
Identification of estrogen-regulated apoptotic
miRNAs
We profiled the miRNA expression in response
to E2 treatment in SNU-387 cells. Among the 84
apoptotic miRNAs analyzed (Figure 1A), 25 miRNAs
were upregulated (>2.0 fold), whereas 10 miRNAs were
downregulated (>2.0 fold) compared with the untreated
control cells (Figure 1B and Supplementary Table S2).

Based on their levels of distinct differential expression, as
well as their relevance to cancer development as revealed
by literature review [13, 17–21], we selected 6 miRNAs
for further validation. Microarray results were confirmed
by evaluating the expression of miRNAs using real-time
PCR. We found miR-23a, miR-26b, miR-92 and miR-122
were significantly upregulated (all with p < 0.05), whereas
miR-143 and miR-17 were significantly downregulated
when compared with untreated control cells (p < 0.01 for
miR-143; p < 0.05 for miR-17) (Figure 1C). This indicated
that the real-time PCR validation results were consistent
with the microarray measurements.

miR-23a processes four ERα-biding sites in its regulatory
region [22], and is implicated in the regulation of seve­
ral important apoptosis-related genes (Supplementary
Table S3). Thus, miR-23a was chosen to be a candidate
to investigate apoptotic miRNA involvement in E2
signaling and selected for further analysis.

Endogenous expression of miR-23a in liver
cancer cell-lines
We measured the expression of miR-23a in 6 liver
cell-lines. As shown in Figure 2A, miR-23a expression in
the female-derived cell line SNU-387 was significantly
higher than that in three of the male-derived cell-lines
Hep3B, Huh7 and HepG2.2.15 (p < 0.001). However,
miR-23a expression in the other 2 male liver cell-lines,
L02 and HepG2, was comparable to SNU-387. Notably,
among the 5 male liver cell-lines, the expression levels
of miR-23a were related to the mutational status of the
tumor suppressor gene p53 in the cells (Figure 2A). When

In silico analysis of miRNA target genes
We speculated that these E2-regulated miRNAs
might play a role in the regulation of apoptosis in HCC.
Therefore, we performed an in silico search for target
genes of these miRNAs, with special focus on apoptosisrelated genes. E2 acts through estrogen receptors (ERs).

compared with cell-lines with wild-type p53 (L02 and
HepG2), cell-lines with null/mutated p53 (Hep3B [p53null], Huh7 [p53-mutated] and HepG2.2.15 [p53-LOH])
had significantly lower expressions of miR-23a (all p <
0.001). Although the female cell-line SNU-387 has a p53heterozygotic genotype [23, 24], its endogenous miR23a expression level was comparable to that in L02 and
HepG2 cells with wild-type p53 (Figure 2A).

a maximum increase of nearly 3-fold at 10−8M E2 (p <
0.01) (Figure 3B). In Hep3B cells, in which no expression
of ERα was detected (Figure 3A), treatment of E2 did
not induce the expression of both ERα and p53 (data not
shown). This might account for the low expression of
miR-23a in Hep3B cells (Figure 2A).
To further confirm that E2 regulates the expression
of p53 through ERα, we pretreated SNU-387 with the
ERα antagonist ICI 182,780 and found that it completely
blocked the induction of ERα and p53 expression by E2
(Figure 3B and 3C). In addition, transient knockdown
of ERα was achieved by siRNA-ERα in SNU-387 cells
with or without E2 treatment that led to a decrease in p53
mRNA (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001 respectively) and protein
expression levels (Figure 3D). Consistent with the above
observations, knockdown of ERα decreased the expression
of miR-23a in SNU-387 cells with or without E2 treatment
(both p < 0.0001) (Figure 3E). These results indicated that
upon ligand E2 binding, ERα activates both p53 and miR23a expression at the transcriptional level.

P53-induced the expression of miR-23a
To confirm whether the difference in miR-23a
expression was related to p53 functional status, we altered
the p53 activity in HepG2 (p53+/+) and Hep3B (p53−/−)
and measured their subsequent effects on miR-23a
expression. As shown in Figure 2B, following treatment
of cells with doxorubicin (DOX), a potent p53 inducer,
miR-23a expression levels was significantly increased
in HepG2 cells when compared with non-treated control
cells (p < 0.0001 at 12 hr; p < 0.01 at 24 hr). In contrast,
DOX treatment did not induce the expression of miR-23a
in Hep3B cells at all the time points (Figure 2B). This
observation was further confirmed by siRNA-mediated
p53 knockdown in HepG2 cells (Figure 2C). As shown in
Figure 2D, in HepG2 cells transfected with control siRNA,
DOX treatment significantly increased the expression of
miR-23a (p < 0.001) when compared with cells without
DOX treatment. However, in HepG2 cells with siRNAmediated p53 knockdown, the expression of miR-23a was
significantly lower when compared with cells transfected
with control siRNA, regardless of the presence or absence
of DOX, (both p < 0.001) (Figure 2D).
The above results indicated that, in the male-derived
HepG2 cells, both expression and activation of p53
were crucial to augment miR-23a expression. However,
in the female-derived SNU-387 cells, despite its p53heterozygotic genotype, its miR-23a expression levels
were comparable with other cell-lines with functional
p53 (Figure 2A). As miR-23a expression in SNU387 was upregulated after E2 treatment (Figure 1 and
Supplementary Table S2), we studied whether E2 affected
p53 expression. As shown in Figure 3C, the expression of
p53 in SNU-387 was significantly increased when treated
with 10−8M E2 (p < 0.001; compared with untreated
controls), indicating that E2 may involve in p53-mediated
regulation of miR-23a expression.

The effects of miR-23a on expression of
anti-apoptotic protein XIAP
We also studied the expression of other target
genes of miR-23a. Among the potential targets of miR23a (Supplementary Table S3), the X-linked inhibitor
of apoptosis protein (XIAP) was chosen for further
analysis. XIAP is the most potent anti-apoptotic protein
and has been demonstrated to be overexpressed in HCC
and counteract apoptosis [25–27]. Furthermore, in silico
analysis predicted that there were five potential miR23a-binding sites in the 3′-UTR of XIAP (Supplementary
Figure S1). The interaction between miR-23a and XIAP
in SNU-387 cells was confirmed by gain-of-function and
loss-of-function approaches. Transfection of cells with
anti-miR-23a, which decreased the level of endogenous
miR-23a (Figure 4A), led to a significant increase in
the expression of the target XIAP at both mRNA and
protein levels (p < 0.001) (Figure 4B and 4C). Similarly,
transfection of cells with miR-23a mimic, which
significantly increased the level of miR-23a (p < 0.001)
(Figure 4A), resulted in the suppression of target XIAP
at both mRNA and protein levels (p < 0.0001) (Figure
4B and 4C). When cells were treated with E2, miR-23a
expression was augmented and XIAP expression was
decreased (both p < 0.001) (Figure 4B and 4C). These
findings suggest that XIAP expression is down-regulated
by miR-23a.

Estrogen increases p53 and miR-23a expression
via estrogen receptor-α
Next, we studied whether the effects of E2 on
miR-23a and p53 expression was mediated via the ERα
receptor. As shown in Figure 3A, SNU-387 cells had a
higher expression of ERα than other male-derived celllines. When SNU-387 cells were treated with E2, an
increased in ERα mRNA expression was observed, with

cells. As shown in Figure 5A, the activity of caspase-3/7

was elevated by 18% in E2 treated cells when compared
with control cells (p < 0.05). This induction of caspase-3/7
activity was abolished by transient knockdown of ERα.
To further prove E2 increases caspase-3/7 activity via
miR-23a, we transfected miR-23a mimic or anti-miR-23a
into SNU-387 and found that miR-23a mimic increased
caspase-3/7 activity by 35% and anti-miR-23a suppressed
caspase-3/7 activity by 26% (both p < 0.005; Figure 5A).
In addition to caspase-3/7 activity, we measured the
expression of capsase-3/7. Caspase-7 is also a predicted
target of miR-23a (Supplementary Table S3). Neither
E2 nor miR-23a had any effect on caspase-7 mRNA
and protein expression (Figure 5B). This suggested that
caspase-7 expression was not regulated by miR-23a in
liver cells, and the induction in caspase-3/7 activity was
likely due to activation of caspase-3. This was confirmed
by the increase in caspase-3 expression in cells treated
with E2 (p < 0.0001) and miR-23a mimic (p < 0.01)
and the decreased caspase-3 expression in anti-miR-23a
transfected cells (p < 0.001; Figure 5C). In concordance
with the above findings, E2 and miR-23a mimic increased
pro-caspase-3 (32kD) and active caspase-3 (17kD) protein

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

expressions, whereas anti-miR-23a suppressed both forms
of caspase-3 protein expressions (Figure 5D). These
results indicate that miR-23a decreased XIAP expression,
which subsequently induced caspase-3 expression and
activity.
Finally, to extend the above findings on activation
of caspase 3 and cell death, we assessed the apoptotic
population in E2-treated SNU-387 cells by Hoechst/PI
double staining and flow cytometry analysis. As shown
in Figure 6A, the number of cells underwent apoptotic
cell death was higher in E2 treated group than controls,
as characterized by condensation of chromatin with
Hoechst/PI double staining. This was consistent with the
data obtained from flow cytometry analysis. E2 treatment
increased the percentage of early (Annexin-V FITC
positive) and late (Annexin-V FITC and PI positive)
apoptotic cells with relative to control cells without
treatment (Figure 6B). Results of both analyses showed
significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells in
SNU-387 with E2 treatment compared with control cells
(p < 0.0001) (Figure 6C). The apoptotic cell death with
E2 treatment, which increased with time confirming the

apoptotic effect of E2 in SNU-387 cells were showed in
Supplementary Figure S3. Taken together, these findings
suggest a novel relationship between E2 treatment,
miR-23a activation and the commitment of the cells to
apoptotic pathway.

Consistent with previous reports in other types
of cancer [15, 16, 31, 32], we found that E2 treatment
regulated apoptotic miRNAs expression in HCC.
Our miRNA PCR array analysis revealed a >2−fold
upregulation in 25 miRNAs and a >2−fold downregulation
in 10 miRNAs. A 2-fold difference in one single miRNA
has been considered to be significant in decreasing the
expression of multiple target genes and proteins resulting
in remarkable physiological effects [33, 34]. Notably, we
found E2 treatment upregulated the tumor suppressive
miRNAs, miR-26a, miR-92 and miR-122, and suppressed
the oncomirs miR-143 and miR-17. Expression of these
tumor suppressive miRNAs and oncomirs have been
reported to be down-regulated and elevated in HCC,
respectively [20, 35–39]. The role of miR-23a has been
reported with varying conclusions. Some early studies
showed that miR-23a promotes cell proliferation and
anti-apoptosis [40, 41]. More recent studies demonstrated
that miR-23a could induce caspase-dependent and
-independent apoptosis in human embryonic kidney cells
[42], and granulosa cells [43]. The different effects of

DISCUSSION
Deregulation of several miRNAs have been reported
to be involved in controlling apoptosis and carcinogenesis
[12]. E2 has been implicated in gender disparity and
attenuated HCC development [4, 28]. However, attempts
to determine miRNAs as posttranscriptional regulators in
E2 signaling in liver cells are scarce. E2 regulates gene
expression by binding to its receptors (ERs) [29]. The
activated ERs then translocate into the nucleus, bind to
DNA, and regulate target gene transcription. As miRNAs
are themselves genes, they too can also be regulated in
this manner. Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated that
ERs bind to regulatory regions upstream of miRNAs and
stimulate their transcription [30].

miR-23a may be related to the fact that the physiological
effects of miRNAs are cell-type dependent and disease
specific [44]. In this study, we found E2 treatment
induced the expression of miR-23a. This is consistent
with previous reports indicating that miR-23a is an E2responsive miRNA [15, 45].
To our knowledge, the present study is the first to
show that miR-23a expression was related to functional
status of p53 in HCC cell-lines. We found that expression
of miR-23a in male liver cell-lines was dependent on a
functional p53. Unexpectedly, in the female cell-line
SNU-387, expression of miR-23a was not completely
p53-dependent. Thus, other transcriptional mechanisms
in addition to p53 signaling might contribute to miR23a expression. We therefore speculated that there was
a link between E2 and p53 on the activation of miR23a expression. We found that E2 treatment induced the
expression of both p53 and ERα in an E2-dependent
manner (Figure 3B and 3C), and transiently knockdown
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of ERα abolished the induction of both p53 and miR23a expression (Figure 3D and 3E). This observation
suggested that upon E2 treatment, ERα might induce
miR-23a expression either directly by binding to miR23a regulatory regions or synergistically by binding to
regulatory region of p53 to activate its expression, and
thus increase the expression of miR-23a. In SUN-387
cells, even one allele of p53 is deficient, the effect of E2
seemed to overcome the deficit in p53 activity in induction
of miR-23a expression. Our findings indicate that E2
treatment has a strong influence on miR-23a expression,
which in turn affects apoptosis.
Apoptosis serves as a natural constraint to cancer
formation and development. Overexpression of XIAP
that counteracts apoptosis has been demonstrated in
HCC [25, 27]. In this study, we observed a clear inverse
relationship between the changes of miR-23a levels and
the expression of its corresponding target gene, XIAP. This
E2-induced reduction of XIAP expression was mediated by

ERα and was associated with an increased caspase-3 mRNA
and protein expression and enhanced caspase 3/7 activity.
These findings suggest that E2-activated ERα exerts a posttranscriptional control on its target gene XIAP, via miR23a, and decrease in XIAP expression may contribute to the
activation of caspase-3 and induction of cell death.
Genome-wide decreases in the miRNAs expression
are common in malignancy and this in turn contributes to
aberrant mRNA expression patterns observed in primary
tumors [10]. p53 has been shown to regulate expression
of miRNAs involved in tumor suppression and cellular
senescence [46, 47]. Loss of p53 function can sensitize
cells to DNA damage due to impaired DNA repair. As a
result, damaged cells are less likely to undergo apoptosis
which may lead to malignant transformation [48]. In this
study, we found E2 treatment increased p53 expression
and subsequently activated miR-23a, thereby suppressing
XIAP expression and causing cell-death. Therefore, it is
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

reasonable to postulate that E2 exerts a tumor suppressor
role in HCC by activation of p53 expression and apoptosis.
This may also explain the sex disparity observed in HCC
development. In fact, miR-23a mediated XIAP expression
has been suggested to have a protective effect and
contributes to the sex difference in brain injury in mice
[49]. Furthermore, suppression of miR-23a inhibited
the activation of p53 target genes and cell death in HCC
cells [50]. Taking these findings together, we propose a
possible model for the effect of E2 on cellular apoptosis.
Upon E2 treatment, ERα expression is activated, which
in turns increases the expression of miR-23a either
directly or through the synergistic effect of increased p53
expression. The increased miR-23a expression results in a
decreased XIAP expression, which subsequently enhances
caspase-3/7 activity through an increase in caspase 3
expression. As a result of the induction of both p53 and
caspase-3/7, cellular apoptosis is enhanced.

In conclusion, this study identified a novel
relationship between E2, p53 and miR-23a in liver
cancer cells. Their interactions suggested a possible
mechanism by which E2 induced cellular apoptosis and
hence conferred a protective role against HCC. Further
delineation of the E2-signaling mechanism in regulating
the activation of p53 and miR-23a expression in HCC
will be crucial to the understanding of the sex difference
observed in this disease entity, and may provide a new
avenue for the development of more efficient therapeutic
strategies and treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and treatment
The five human liver cancer cell lines (SNU-387,
Huh7, HepG2, HepG2.2.15 and Hep3B) were obtained
from the ATCC. The L02 cell line derived from human
normal liver was obtained from the Shanghai Institutes
for Biological Sciences, and Chinese Academy of
Sciences. Only SNU-387, HepG2.2.15 and Hep3B are
HBV positive cell lines. Cells were cultured in RPMI1640 medium without phenol red, supplemented with
10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at
37°C. SNU-387 was a female-derived liver cancer cellline, and the others were male-derived cell-lines. Before
treatment, cells were starved overnight in serum-free
medium. Unless otherwise stated, cells were generally
treated with 17β-estradiol (E2) (10−8M) or doxorubicin
hydrochloride (DOX) (0.5 μM) (Tocris Bioscience,
Ellisville, MO) for 24 hours.

For miRNA analysis, mature miRNA was extracted
from cell lines with or without drug stimulation or
transfection (as described above). miRNAs were reversetranscribed using the TaqMan MicroRNA reverse
transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
Real-time PCR was performed using Taqman miRNA
assays (assay ID: 000399, 000466, 000393, 000407,
000430, 002245) (Applied Biosystems), according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. U6 snRNA was
not responsive to E2 treatment and stable among all
cell-lines thus was used as the endogenous control
(Supplementary Figure S2). For target gene analysis,
total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the
Superscript III First-strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen).
qPCR and semi-quantitative PCR were performed
using the SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied
Biosystems) and ThermoScript™ RT-PCR System
(Invitrogen), respectively. GAPDH was used as the
internal control. Mean Ct was determined from triplicate
PCRs. The relative expression level was then calculated
using the ΔΔCT method. Primer sequences are listed in
Supplementary Table S1.

Transient miRNA and siRNA transfection
Transfection was performed with Lipofectamine
2000 reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s
protocol. Briefly, 3 × 105 cells were seeded in plates one
day before transfection to ensure suitable cell confluency
on the day of transfection. Oligonucleotides (miR-23a
mimic and anti-miR-23a) (Ambion, Austin, TX) were
used at a final concentration of 20nM in antibiotic-free
Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen). siRNAs (against ERα
and p53) (Qiagen) were used at a final concentration of
50nM. siRNAs with non-specific sequences were used as
controls. Cells were harvested at day 2 post-transfection.

Caspase activity assay
Caspase 3/7 activity was analyzed using the
Caspase-GLO 3/7 kit (Promega, Madison, WI) as
recommended by manufacturer’s instructions. Following
E2 treatment, SNU-387 and Hep3B cells were transfected
with miR-23a mimic or anti-miR-23a in a 96-well plate.
After 24 hours, cells were incubated with medium
supplemented with 100 μl caspase-3/7 reagent for 3 hours
at room temperature. Then, luminescence from cleaved

RNA isolation
Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s

Apoptosis detection by flow cytometry and
Hoechst 33258/propidium iodide double staining
SNU-387 cells were treated with E2 (10−8M) for
24 hours. Cells were harvested (including attached and
detached cells), washed and resuspended with PBS. For
flow cytometry analysis, apoptotic cells were determined
with an Annexin V- FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD
Pharmingen, SD, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Apoptosis cells were analyzed by using FC500
flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Germany). The data
were analyzed using Flowjo software (Tree Star, OR,
USA). For Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) and propidium iodide
(PI) (Sigma) double staining analysis, cells were incubated
with Hoechst 33258 (10 μg/mL) and PI (10 μg/mL) for 15
minutes, and then fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 20 minutes.
Imaging was detected under a fluorescence microscope
(Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) at 340 and 620 nm, respectively.

Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer with 1 mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Roche). Protein
concentration was determined by BCA Protein Assay Kit
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA USA). 20–50 μg of protein
was loaded on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred
to a PVDF membrane, blocked with 5% milk, and then
probed with relevant primary antibodies to XIAP, ERα, p53 (Santa Cruz, CA), caspase-3/7 and β-actin (Cell
Signaling, MA) overnight at 4°C. Protein expression was
assessed by ECL detection system (GE Healthcare, NJ)
and band intensities were quantified using the Image J
software (NIH, Bethesda, MD).

Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as mean ±
standard error (SEM) and analyzed using the student’s
t-test. All statistical analysis was done using GraphPad
Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc. San Diego, CA).
A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
