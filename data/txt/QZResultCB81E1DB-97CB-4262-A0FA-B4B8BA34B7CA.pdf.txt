BACKGROUND: The authors evaluated the patterns of use and the risk of thromboembolic events (TEE) associated
with erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) in older patients with metastatic breast cancer who were receiving
chemotherapy. METHODS: The study was retrospective and used the SEER-Medicare linked database. Stage IV breast
cancer patients diagnosed from 1995-2005, treated with chemotherapy, 66 years old, with full coverage of Medicare
A and B were included. The World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) and the
Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) were used to identify the use of ESAs, chemotherapy, and
complications of therapy. Analyses included descriptive statistics and logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 2266 women,
980 (43.3%) received ESAs, and 1286 (56.7%) did not. Patients diagnosed after 1999 or who received treatment with
taxanes, anthracyclines, or vinorelbine were more likely to receive ESAs. Patients receiving ESAs had higher rates of
stroke (18.5% vs 15.1%, P ¼ .031); deep-vein thrombosis (DVT; 21.3% vs 14.4%, P<.001), other/unspecified thromboembolic event (TEE; 19.8% vs 14.7%, P ¼ .001), and any clot (31.3% vs 23.4%, P<.0001). In multivariate analysis, patients
receiving ESAs had increased risk for DVT (odds ratio [OR], 1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.75), and any
clot (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.02-1.57). A dose-dependent effect was evident for stroke, DVT, other TEE, and any clot.
CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients, the use of ESAs increased the risk of TEEs, with a dose-dependent effect
for stroke, DVT, other TEE, and any clot. The data show that among patients treated with chemotherapy and ESAs
for metastatic breast cancer, TEEs are a common event. Therefore, caution is recommended when using these agents.

The erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), erythropoietin and darbepoetin, have been widely used to increase hemoglobin values and reduce transfusion requirements in cancer patients.1-3 Recent clinical trials and various meta-analyses
have raised safety concerns, as results suggest that the use of ESAs is associated with adverse outcomes including thromboembolic events (TEEs) and potentially tumor progression and decreased survival.4-6
It is well known that patients with cancer have an increased risk of TEE7; however, an even higher incidence of embolic and thrombotic events has been seen in cancer patients treated with ESAs for different malignancies.8-11 A recent
meta-analysis showed that patients with cancer who received ESAs had a higher risk of TEEs (hazard ratio [HR], 1.57;
95% CI, 1.31-1.87) and mortality (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.01-1.20) than control patients.5 Current American Society of
Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend awareness of

the adverse outcomes associated with ESA use and advise
its use exclusively in patients with chemotherapy-induced
anemia who are being treated with noncurative
intent.12,13
Despite evidence, there is not a clear description of
the different TEEs that are associated with ESAs use. Also,
questions concerning a dose effect remain unanswered,
and it is unclear whether increasing doses or longer durations of treatment are associated with worse outcomes.
Although ESAs are agents that are widely used to treat
cancer patients, to the best of our knowledge, there is no
clear description of the patterns of ESAs use in patients
with metastatic breast cancer. In this retrospective cohort
study, using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results (SEER)-Medicare database, we sought to estimate
the use of ESAs and to evaluate the TEEs associated with
its use in patients older than 66 years of age and who were
receiving chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source
We used the SEER-Medicare linked database. The SEER
program, supported by the US National Cancer Institute
(NCI), collects data from tumor registries; during the
years included in this study, it covered 14% to 25% of the
US population.14 The Medicare program is administered
by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and
covers 97% of the US population aged 65 years and
older.15 SEER participants are matched with their Medicare records under an agreement between the NCI and
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Of SEER
participants who were diagnosed with cancer at age 65
years or older, 94% are matched with their Medicare
enrollment records.15 Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and treatment information were extracted
from the SEER-Medicare Patient Entitlement and Diagnosis Summary File.
Study Population
In the SEER-Medicare database, 268,198 men and
women were diagnosed with breast cancer between January 1995 and December 2005. We included patients aged
66 years who had a diagnosis of stage IV breast cancer
(according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer
staging system, third edition) and were treated with chemotherapy. Patients were required to have Medicare Part A
and Part B and not to be members of a health maintenance organization (HMO) for 1 year before and after

3642

their breast cancer diagnosis because Medicare claims
are not complete for HMO members. Patients who had
end-stage renal disease (ESRD), prior cancer, or a noncarcinoma tumor histology were excluded.
From the initial 268,198 patients with breast cancer
diagnosed from 1995 to 2005, 23,885 had a history of
prior or subsequent malignancies, 843 had unknown
month of diagnosis, 85,266 were aged younger than 66
years at diagnosis, 151,066 had an initial stage other than
IV, 2047 did not have full coverage from both Medicare
A and B or were members of an HMO, 16 had noncarcinoma histology, and 45 had ESRD. From the remaining
5030 patients, 2764 did not receive chemotherapy. A total
of 2266 patients were included in this study.
Data Extraction and Definitions
To identify patients who received ESAs, we looked for
related codes in the Medicare claims at any time after diagnosis. The following HCPCS codes were used for defining ESAs regimens: Q0136, J0885, Q0137, J0880,
J0881, and C1774. For this analysis, a single dose of
erythropoietin alfa was defined as 40,000 U and was considered equivalent to a dose of darbepoetin alfa of 200
lg.12 To identify patients that received chemotherapy, we
searched for the following codes: ICD-9-CM procedure
code 9925 for a hospital inpatient or outpatient facility
claim of chemotherapy; HCPCS codes J8510, J8520,
J8521, J5530 through J8999, and J9000 through J9999,
excluding J9202, J9209, J9212 through J9214, J9217,
J9218 in physician, outpatient or durable medical equipment (DME) files. Revenue center codes 0331, 0332, and
0335 for an outpatient claim of chemotherapy; and the
ICD-9-CM V codes V58.1, V66.2, V67.2 in inpatient,
outpatient, physician, or DME files were also used.
To look for toxicities associated with ESAs, TEEs
were identified by using the following ICD-09 diagnosis
codes in inpatient, DME, physician, and outpatient files:
Diagnosis code 410 was identified as myocardial infarction (MI) 410; 433-436, 438 as stroke; code 415.1x was
identified as pulmonary embolism (PE); codes 451,
453.1, 453.2, and 453.4 were identified as deep vein
thrombosis (DVT); and codes 452, 453, 453.0, 453.3,
453.5, 453.6, 453.7, 453.8, and 453.9 were identified as
other/unclassified TEEs. The other/unclassified category
included codes for various conditions such as portal vein
thrombosis and Budd-Chiari syndrome, renal vein
thrombosis, thrombosis of veins excluding the pulmonary, cerebral and coronary veins, and embolism or
thrombosis of unspecified veins, among others. A

comorbidity score was calculated using Klabunde’s adaptation of the Charlson comorbidity index from the SAS
macro provided by the National Cancer Institute
(NCI).16-19 The comorbidities included in the score are
myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, peripheral
vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, dementia, diabetes (with and without end-organ damage), chronic pulmonary disease, connective tissue disease, ulcer disease,
liver disease, renal disease, hemiplegia, and acquired
immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
Demographic data was obtained from the SEERMedicare Patient Entitlement and Diagnosis Summary
File. For the census tract variables of education and poverty level, quartiles were calculated in increasing order.
Data from the 2000 census were supplemented with 1990
data when 2000 data were missing. Patients were followed
from diagnosis date until loss of Medicare coverage,
enrollment in a health maintenance organization, or
death.
Statistical Analysis
Demographic and tumor characteristics between patients
receiving or not receiving ESAs were compared using the
chi-square test, or Wilcoxon test as indicated. To determine the factors associated with ESAs use, a multivariate
logistic regression model was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) of receiving ESAs. The variables included in the
multivariate logistic regression model included the type of
chemotherapy that was used (taxanes, anthracyclines,
vinorelbine), age, sex, race, marital status, education level,
poverty level, year of diagnosis, geographical location, tumor grade, estrogen receptor status, and comorbidities.
The different TEE categories evaluated were MI, stroke,
PE, DVT, other/unclassified TEE, and any clot. Any clot
was defined as at least 1 event in any of the other previously mentioned categories. For each TEE category, the
proportion of patients experiencing the outcome was calculated according to ESAs group. To avoid bias, we
excluded the patients that had the outcome under study
the year before their breast cancer diagnosis. For each of
these outcome variables, we performed a univariate analysis with ESAs in the model. Then for the multivariable
logistic regression analysis, we adjusted ESAs by age, race,
education level, poverty level, year of diagnosis, geographical region, estrogen-receptor status, comorbidities and
transfusion. Results are expressed in odds ratios (OR)
with 95% Wald confidence intervals (CIs).
To evaluate for a potential dose effect, a similar multivariate analysis was performed using ESAs as a categori-

cal variable based on the number of doses received per
patient (>0-5, 5-16, >16), the reference value was no use
for ESAs. When a change in the estimate by dose was
seen, a trend was evaluated by introducing the ESA dose
category as a numerical variable and testing the significance of the model’s linearity in the same multivariate
model. All computer programming and statistical analyses
were performed with the SAS system (SAS Institute, Cary,
North Carolina), and all tests were 2 sided.
According to the NCI regulations, and to preserve
confidentiality, in Table 1, thecategories that included
less than 11 patients were omitted (educational level
unknown, poverty level unknown); however, such variables were still included in our analysis.

RESULTS
Our final cohort included 2266 patients, 980 (43.3%) of
them received ESAs, and 1286 (56.7%) did not; median
time of follow-up was 37 months. Patient demographics
and tumor characteristics are listed in Table 1. The median
time from diagnosis to first dose of chemotherapy was 3
months. Among patients receiving ESAs, median time to
first ESAs dose was 5 months, and the median number of
doses administered was 9 (standard deviation, 18.3).
When evaluating the factors associated with ESAs
use, we observed that the patients who received anthracyclines (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.48-2.31), taxanes (OR, 2.74;
95% CI, 2.25-3.35), and vinorelbine (OR, 4.51; 95% CI,
3.37-6.04) were more likely to receive ESAs than patients
who were not treated with such antineoplastic agents.
Other factors associated with the use of ESAs were year of
diagnosis (2000-2002 vs 1995-1999; OR, 3.06; 95% CI,
2.32-4.04; and 2003-2005 vs 1995-1999; OR, 3.76; 95%
CI, 2.83-5.00) and some geographical locations. The
complete multivariate analysis is shown in Table 2.
The rates of TEEs among patients who received and
did not receive ESAs are shown in Figure 1. Higher crude
rates of stroke (18.5% vs 15.1%, P ¼ .031), DVT (21.3%
vs 14.4%, P < .0001), other/unspecified TEE (19.8% vs
14.7, P ¼ .001), and any clot (31.3% vs 23.4%,
P<.0001) were seen in patients who received ESAs. No
difference in the rate of MI (P ¼ .989) or PE (P ¼ .523)
was observed. The crude and adjusted estimates for the
analysis of ESAs use on TEEs are shown in Table 3.
After adjusting for possible confounding variables, we
observed that patients receiving ESAs had an increased
risk of developing a DVT (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.05-1.75)
and any clot (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.02-1.57) compared

DISCUSSION
Our study shows that, in patients aged older than 66 years
with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy, the
use of ESAs increases the risk of TEEs, specifically DVTs
and any clot. The magnitude of the increase was notable.
Patients treated with ESAs had an absolute increase in the

rates of clots of almost 10% compared with patients not
treated with ESAs. A dose-dependent effect for stroke,
DVT, other/unspecified TEE, and any clot was seen, such
that the risk was increased for patients who received more
than 5 doses of ESAs, and the risk was even higher in those
receiving more than 16 doses. There was no apparent
increase in risk for patients who received only 1-4 doses.
Our results are consistent with previously published
data. In a recent meta-analysis that included 51 phase 3
clinical trials (n ¼ 8172),5 the risk of TEE (HR, 1.57;
95% CI, 1.31-1.8) was higher among patients treated
with ESAs. This estimate is higher than what we report,
but it is important to mention that in this meta-analysis,
patients with different malignancies were included and
also treatment and target hemoglobin varied among trials,
as also did the TEE definitions. Aapro et al20 performed a
meta-analysis that included 12 trials and a total of 2297
patients with nonmyeloid haematological malignancies
and different solid tumors. The analysis was stratified for
a target hemoglobin of 11 g/dL, corresponding to current European Organization for Research and Treatment
of Cancer guidelines.21 An increased frequency of TEEs
was seen with epoetin-beta versus control (7% vs 4%);
however, TEE-related mortality was similar in both
groups.20 In our analysis, the absolute increase in risk of
TEEs was more pronounced, possibly because our population was older and our study cohort was not limited to
patients on clinical trials, who presumably would be
healthier.

Figure 2. Plot of estimated odds ratios for developing thromboembolic events is shown according to different ESA dose distribution. The x axis is the distribution of accumulated ESA units. The y axis is the estimated odds ratio from the univariate logistic
regression for different toxicity events. The 3 horizontal lines are odds ratios ¼ 1, 2, 3; the 2 vertical lines are the cutoff ESA units
at 5 and 16.

Hershman et al22 very recently reported data on an
observational study using the SEER-Medicare database.
They included patients receiving chemotherapy who were
diagnosed with diffuse B-cell lymphoma, colon, or breast
and lung cancer in different stages. They observed that the
use of ESAs was associated with more recent diagnosis,
younger age, comorbidities, female sex, and metastatic or
recurrent cancer. From the 14,024 patients with breast
cancer, 27.4% received ESAs, and 12% had an episode of
thrombosis. In the analysis of the complete cohort, they
observed higher rates of thrombosis in the patients who
received ESAs (HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.79-2.07).22 The risk
estimates that we found are in same direction but of less
magnitude, perhaps associated with our more homogeneous patient population.
We did not observe an increased risk of MI in
patients receiving ESAs. This association has not been
consistently reported in cancer patients; however, it has
been reported in the renal literature.23,24 In our study, the
absolute number of patients with a stroke was higher
among patients receiving ESAs. In the multivariate model,
there was a nonsignificant trend for increased risk of
stroke in patients treated with ESAs, and we observed a
significant trend in the number of doses and the risk of
developing stroke. This observation has not been reported
in the oncological literature. However, higher rates of fatal

Cancer

and nonfatal stroke have been seen in diabetic patients
with ESRD who were receiving darbepoetin (HR, 1.92;
95% CI, 1.38-2.68).25 In approximately 30% of patients
with ESRD treated with ESAs, hypertension develops or
worsens,23 and this phenomenon has been linked to a
higher risk of vascular events.23,26 Further studies are warranted to define the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular
events associated with ESA use in cancer patients.
It has been suggested that hemoglobin level may
relate to the risk of TEEs, with greater risk associated with
higher hemoglobin levels.27 Some of the trials where an
excess of TEEs was reported, targeted hemoglobin levels
were higher than those in enrolled patients who were not
anemic at baseline or targeted hemoglobin levels higher
than those recommended by current ESA labeling. In the
Breast Cancer Erythropoietin Survival Trial (BEST)
study,2 patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with
chemotherapy were randomized to receive erythropoietin
or not. Similar rates of TEE were seen between groups
(16% vs 14%). The trial was stopped because of increased
mortality in the group treated with erythropoietin; a subsequent chart review revealed an increased number of
TEE-associated deaths in those who received ESAs (14 vs
4). Patients who were not anemic were targeted to hemoglobin levels of 12 g/dL to 14 g/dL. The target was maintained for 59% of patient weeks in the treatment arm,

3647

Original Article

compared with 45% of patient weeks in the placebo group
(P < .001).2 In a similar group of patients, The Breast
Cancer–Anemia and the Value of Erythropoietin
(BRAVE) trial8 evaluated whether erythropoietin use
improved survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer. A total of 463 patients treated with anthracyline- and/
or taxane-based chemotherapy were randomized to
receive 30,000 U of erythropoietin beta or control once
weekly for 24 weeks. After 18 months, no differences in
overall survival (P ¼ .522) or progression-free survival (P
¼ .448) were seen; however, patients treated with ESAs
experienced more TEEs than controls (13% vs 6%, P ¼
.012), with no difference in the rate of serious TEEs (4%
vs 3%).8 In a different patient population, Henke et al28
attempted to sensitize head and neck tumors to radiation
therapy by randomizing patients to receive erythropoietin
or placebo and targeted a hemoglobin level of 12 g/dL to
14 g/dL in women and 13 g/dL to 15 g/dL in men. Vascular events defined as hypertension, hemorrhage, DVT,
and PE were seen in 11% of patients in the treatment arm
and in only 5% of the patients randomized to placebo.
The number of patients who died from cardiac disorders
was higher in the treatment arm (n ¼ 10 vs 5). Unfortunately, in the SEER-Medicare dataset, no information
was available on patient hemoglobin, so it was not possible to evaluate the impact of hemoglobin levels.
In our study, we found that patients who received
more than 5 doses of ESAs had a higher risk of developing
a stroke, a DVT, other/unspecified TEE, and any clot.
Contrary to our results, Rosenzweig et al10 found no relation with the number of doses or the mean number of
weeks a patient received erythropoietin. This trial was
stopped early because 28.5% of the patients in the treatment arm developed a TEE, compared with no event at
all in the control arm.
Recently, Khorana et al29 identified an association
between red blood cell transfusions and an increased risk
of TEEs. In a large, retrospective, cohort study in patients
with cancer, they observed that transfusions increased the
risk of venous thromboembolism (OR, 1.53; 95% CI,
1.46-1.61). To avoid having our risk estimates confounded by this association, we included transfusion in
our regression model.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest
study, including exclusively patients with metastatic
breast cancer receiving chemotherapy, in which an assessment of the patterns of ESA use and the relation between
ESAs and different TEEs is made. One of the strengths of
this study is that it involves a large, population-based

3648

cohort of older patients; therefore, it includes patients
who may be excluded from randomized clinical trials, possibly reflecting real clinical practice. It is important to
mention that in our cohort of patients, we observed a high
incidence of TEEs. Independent of whether patients
received ESAs or not, we believe that this study includes a
high-risk group. Old age, comorbidities, and that all of
the patients had metastatic disease and were receiving
chemotherapy likely contributed to the high incidence of
TEEs observed. In addition, we defined our outcomes by
the presence of at least 1 diagnosis code specifically for
TEE, which could have resulted in an overdiagnosis of the
outcomes. However, if misclassification occurred, it
would not have differed between our study groups; thus,
misclassification is not likely to have caused any change in
our risk estimates.
A limitation of our study is that the SEER-Medicare
data do not allow assessment of the extent of the disease,
the severity of outcomes, or for an analysis that takes into
account the patient’s hemoglobin level, which, as previously mentioned, has been related with adverse outcomes.
It is possible that factors such as a large volume of disease
or genetic predisposition may impact TEE incidence, but
we were not able to adjust for such factors. One will
expect, however, that these potential confounders were
present in similar proportion in patients who received and
who did not receive ESAs. It is possible that patients
receiving ESAs were not captured in Medicare claims;
however, because of the expense of the medication and the
exclusion of patients with secondary insurance, we believe
is unlikely this occurred in a significant number of
patients. A minor limitation in our study is that our
cohort exclusively included patients aged 66 years and
older. The results, thus, may not be applicable to a population of younger, and in general, healthier patients. Additional studies are needed to prospectively confirm these
findings and to assess the complications and toxicities
associated with the use of ESAs in younger women with
metastatic breast cancer. It is important to mention that
observational studies cannot establish causality. There are
data from randomized trials proving the association
between the use of ESAs and TEEs. However, our study
cannot rule out that the reason for ESA administration
also placed patients at higher risk of developing a TEE.
In summary, we have shown that in this cohort of
patients, the use of ESAs increased the risk of certain
TEEs. Our data show that among patients treated with
chemotherapy and ESAs for metastatic breast cancer,
TEEs are a common event. Therefore, ESAs should be
