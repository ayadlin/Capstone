Abstract
The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is chromosomally
rearranged in a subset of certain cancers, including 2% to 7% of
non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) and 70% of anaplastic
large cell lymphomas (ALCL). The ALK kinase inhibitors crizotinib and ceritinib are approved for relapsed ALKþ NSCLC, but
acquired resistance to these drugs limits median progression-free
survival on average to 10 months. Kinase domain mutations are
detectable in 25% to 37% of resistant NSCLC samples, with
activation of bypass signaling pathways detected frequently with
or without concurrent ALK mutations. Here we report that, in
contrast to NSCLC cells, drug-resistant ALCL cells show no evidence of bypassing ALK by activating alternate signaling pathways. Instead, drug resistance selected in this setting reﬂects

upregulation of ALK itself. Notably, in the absence of crizotinib
or ceritinib, we found that increased ALK signaling rapidly
arrested or killed cells, allowing a prolonged control of drugresistant tumors in vivo with the administration of discontinuous
rather than continuous regimens of drug dosing. Furthermore,
even when drug resistance mutations were detected in the kinase
domain, overexpression of the mutant ALK was toxic to tumor cells.
We conﬁrmed these ﬁndings derived from human ALCL cells in
murine pro-B cells that were transformed to cytokine independence
by ectopic expression of an activated NPM–ALK fusion oncoprotein. In summary, our results show how ALK activation functions as
a double-edged sword for tumor cell viability, with potential
therapeutic implications. Cancer Res; 75(14); 2916–27. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

recurrent t(2;5)(p23;q35) chromosomal rearrangement found in
anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL), an uncommon tumor
derived from mature T cells (7). The resulting NPM–ALK fusion
kinase and other less common ALK fusions drive malignant
growth in 70% of ALCL cases. Though identiﬁed in ALCL 20
years ago, ALK has only become a target for intensive drug
development since 2007, when its presence was discovered in a
subset of non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, activation is
again through chromosomal rearrangement creating an expressed
and activated fusion kinase, most commonly EML4-ALK (8, 9).
Such rearrangements are present in 2% to 7% of NSCLC cases
and led to a 57% response in phase 1 evaluation of the ﬁrst-inclass ALK TKI crizotinib in relapsed ALKþ NSCLC patients (10).
The drug won accelerated limited FDA approval in 2011 and
subsequently promoted longer progression-free survival than
chemotherapy as ﬁrst or second-line treatment for metastatic
ALKþ NSCLC (11, 12). The second-generation inhibitor ceritinib
(LDK378) was approved recently for crizotinib-resistant ALKþ
NSCLC patients based on a 58% response rate in phase 1,
including 56% response in patients with prior crizotinib exposure
(13), and several other ALK TKIs are under development (14).
ALCL, meanwhile, which makes up 2% to 5% of non-Hodgkin
lymphoma (NHL), is the most common T-cell NHL in children
and the third most common in adults. Although ALKþ ALCL has
better response to chemotherapy than other peripheral T-cell
lymphomas (15), poor prognosis of relapsed or refractory
patients and its predilection for younger populations have
prompted clinical investigation of ALK tyrosine kinase inhibition
in both adults and children with the disease (16, 17).

ALK is a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed in the developing
nervous system (1, 2). Chromosomal rearrangements in subsets
of several cancers result in constitutive expression and activation
of its C-terminal kinase domain, which proliﬁcally turns on
oncogenic signaling pathways, including JAK3/STAT3, MEK/ERK,
and PI3K/AKT (3–6). Addiction of tumor cells to ALK activity in
laboratory models and promising activity of ALK inhibition in
early-phase clinical trials have made it an intensive target for TKI
development in recent years. ALK originally was cloned from the

ALK TKI Resistance Leads to Oncogene Overdose in Lymphoma

Studies of resistance to crizotinib in NSCLC identify targetdependent mechanisms such as kinase-domain mutations and
fusion-ALK copy-number gains in 34% to 46%; resistant cases
also show frequent activation of known alternate NSCLC drivers
such as c-KIT, EGFR, or KRAS, both with and without concurrent
ALK mutations, whereas many cases are resistant for unclear
reasons (14, 18, 19). Here, we studied resistance to ALK-kinase
inhibition in ALKþ ALCL using both crizotinib and ceritinib. In
contrast to ﬁndings in lung cancer, our study identiﬁed no ability
of ALCL cells to bypass the driver kinase by activation of alternate
pathways. Instead, cells upregulated NPM–ALK expression
through genomic ampliﬁcation and other mechanisms, suggesting a nearly absolute addiction to ALK-kinase activity. Strikingly,
however, withdrawal of ALK inhibitor from resistant cells causes
rapid growth arrest followed by entry into apoptosis, which
promoted regression of tumors in vivo.

were equimolarly pooled and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq
for paired 84bp reads using Illumina's MiSeq Reagent Kit v3
(#MS-102-3001). FASTQ ﬁles generated from the Illumina
MiSeq were aligned against build 37 of the human reference
genome using the Burrows-Wheeler Alignment (BWA) tool
(22). Following alignment, .sai ﬁles were used to create .sam
(sequence alignment map) ﬁles, which were used to create
binary sequence (.bam) ﬁles using SAMtools (23). PCR duplicates were ﬂagged for removal using Picard (http://picard.
sourceforge.net), and base quality scores were recalibrated
using Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK; ref. 24). Comparisons
within each cell line family were performed to identify point
mutations and small indels using three somatic callers, including Seurat (25), MuTect (26), and Strelka (27) as well as Sanger
sequencing.
Transfections, infections, and selection
Phoenix packaging cells were seeded at 700,000 cells/mL for
16 hours, to which, a cocktail of DMEM, X-treme GENE 9 DNA
transfection reagent (Roche #06365787001) and 1 mg MIGNPM–ALK was added drop-wise. This mixture was incubated for
48 hours to allow production of viral supernatant. A total of
100,000 murine pro-B 5-12 cells were then resuspended in 600 mL
of syringe-ﬁltered viral supernatant mixed with 150 mL of a 5
infection solution (WeHi-3B, Polybreen, and interleukin-3). This
was repeated a further three times with at least 6 hours between
each repeat to allow viral supernatant to reach maximum titer.
Cells were then plated in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with
10% FBS, P/S, 10% WeHi-3B supernatant, and interleukin-3 for
24 hours and assessed by FACS (using the Guava EasyCyte ﬂow
cytometer) for GFP levels as a mark of initial infection. Cytokine
withdrawal was carried out by washing cells in RPMI 1640 media
supplemented with 10% FBS and P/S four times and subsequently
plating them in this cytokine-free media with 1:1,000 DMSO or
the indicated ceritinib concentrations. FACS plots were analyzed
using FlowJo version 10.
Xenograft experiments
All mouse experiments were approved by the University of
Arizona Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol no. 12-377).
Mice were maintained under speciﬁc pathogen-free conditions,
and food and water were provided ad libitum.
In vivo dependence
Severe combined immunodeﬁciency (SCID) mice were
injected with 2  106 K299-CR1000 cells in 1:1 Matrigel and
sterile saline in a total volume of 100 mL subcutaneously into the
lower ﬂank. These mice were divided immediately to two groups
for treatment with ceritinib or vehicle by oral gavage. Ceritinib
was formulated freshly before each dosing as a solution in 0.5%
MC (methylcellulose)/0.5% Tween 80 as described (28). Because
of the requirement for ALK inhibition for K299-CR1000 cells in
vitro, dosing began on the day of ﬂank injections 2 hours before
hand and continued daily.
Up-front intermittent versus continuous dosing
SCID mice were injected with 2  106 Karpas-299 parental cells
as above. After tumors reached 500 mm3, the mice were split
into seven cohorts (n ¼ 3) and were treated continuously with
vehicle, continuously with ceritinib (at either 33.33 or 50 mg/kg)
or intermittently with the same concentrations of ceritinib using a
`4 weeks on, 2 weeks off' schedule.

Statistical analysis
Two-tailed Student t test was carried out for all expression data
using the GraphPad t test calculator and veriﬁed using the SPSS
Statistics software from IBM, with P < 0.05 considered statistically
signiﬁcant with a 95% conﬁdence interval. Apoptosis data were
calculated using the Mann–Whitney test in GraphPad where P ¼
0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant with a 95% conﬁdence
interval.

Results
TKI resistance and dependence are invariably coselected in
ALKþ ALCL
NPM–ALK-driven ALCL cell lines Karpas-299, SU-DHL-1,
and SUP-M2 were highly sensitive to crizotinib and ceritinib,
with the latter drug having 3 to 5 greater potency (Fig. 1A;
Supplementary Table S1). We selected for resistance to both
inhibitors independently through serial plating in increasing
drug concentrations (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Cells derived
from Karpas-299 able to grow in 1,000 nmol/L crizotinib
(hereafter K299-CR1000) strikingly when washed out of ALK
inhibitor and reassessed for drug sensitivity showed viability
stimulation by both inhibitors (Fig. 1B). Stimulation was an
on-target effect, indicated by the stimulation at lower concentration by the more potent inhibitor. All resistant clones
emerging from selections demonstrated similar ﬁndings [Fig.
1C, lines named for parent, drug used in selection (L for
ceritinib/LDK378), and top nanomolar concentration]. When
washed out of inhibitor and plated in drug-free media, resistant
cells halted growth, suggesting ALK inhibition had become a
requirement for viability (Fig. 1D–E). Plated without ALK
inhibitor, resistant lines appeared shrunken and involuted,
consistent with onset of apoptosis, while those in either ALK
inhibitor appeared viable similar to parent cells growing without drug (Fig. 1F; Supplementary Fig. S1B). Flow cytometry
conﬁrmed entry into apoptosis by resistant cells plated in drugfree media, in contrast to those maintained in either ALK
inhibitor (Fig. 1G). ALKþ ALCL cells therefore reliably develop
ALK-inhibitor dependence at the same time they develop resistance, suggesting selection for a process with paradoxical effects
on viability.
NPM–ALK upregulation drives both resistance and dependence
To investigate the resistant-dependent phenotype, we performed long-insert whole-genome sequencing (LI-WGS;
ref. 20) of the Karpas-299 parent line and the K299-CR1000
subclone. Mapping of reads against the reference genome
(hg19) showed ampliﬁcation in the subclone of the portions
of the NPM and ALK loci that are translocated to form NPM–
ALK (Fig. 2A). Copy-number assays demonstrated gain consistent with genomic ampliﬁcation speciﬁcally of the fusion
locus but not the uninvolved portions of either gene (Fig. 2B).
This generated more than 50-fold increased expression of
NPM–ALK mRNA (Fig. 2C). The additional resistant-dependent subclones also had increased expression relative to their
corresponding parent lines (Fig. 2D), ranging from 1.5 for
SUP-LR150 to 12.0 for K299-LR150. Of these, only K299LR150 had clear evidence of NPM–ALK copy-number gain
(Supplementary Fig. S2), demonstrating increased expression
results also from other mechanisms. NPM–ALK protein levels
also were elevated in subclones (Fig. 2E). This is seen at NPM–

ALK's full-length position (80 kDa) and at a prominent high
molecular weight aggregate band known to result from elevated NPM–ALK protein levels (29). Activating ALK autophosphorylation, highly drug sensitive in parent lines, was
drug resistant in subclones during TKI exposure. STAT3 activation previously was shown to be required for ALK-mediated
lymphomagenesis (30). In addition, the gene-expression signature of clinical cases is most similar to that of a STAT3
survival signature (31). We found all resistant subclones preserved STAT3 phosphorylation during ALK inhibitor exposure
in marked contrast to the drug-sensitive parent lines (Fig. 2E).
Subclones withdrawn from drug showed increase in ALK and
STAT3 phosphorylation but, interestingly, slight but noticeable
decline in total STAT3, suggesting feedback repression of

STAT3 expression. In sum, increased ALK expression drives
resistance associated with preserved STAT3 activation but leads
to increased ALK signaling when drug is withdrawn. This
combined with the rescue of cell viability by ALK inhibition
(Fig. 1) supports a conclusion that ALK overdose is the reason
for growth arrest and apoptosis upon inhibitor withdrawal.
We also performed both Sanger and targeted deep sequencing
of the NPM–ALK fusion locus (Supplementary Table S2). Neither
K299-CR1000 nor K299-LR150 cells developed any second-site
kinase-domain mutations. Resistance in these lines therefore was
driven purely by increased NPM–ALK levels. The same may be true
of DHL1-CR500, which acquired only R1192P, a germline predisposition allele for neuroblastoma with no known role in TKI
resistance (32). Intriguingly, both SUP-CR500 and SUP-LR150

developed mutations with known roles in TKI resistance (respectively I1171S, seen only by Sanger sequencing, and F1174L, seen
by both targeted and Sanger sequencing; Supplementary Table S2;
refs. 33–36). The fact that these lines also developed ALK upregulation leading to TKI dependence to avoid signaling overdose
further illustrates the intense pressure for these systems to
acquire target-dependent resistance. Moreover, a treatment
strategy designed to exploit ALK overdose such as discontinuous dosing may be at least temporarily successful even when
drug-speciﬁc kinase-domain mutations also have begun to
arise.
ALK overdose also impairs the ﬁtness of cytokine-dependent
pro-B cells
To replicate resistance-dependence in an independent system,
we employed the FL5.12 line, murine pro-B cells that rapidly cease
proliferating and undergo apoptosis without IL3 (37). We created
NPM–ALK-dependent FL5.12 lines through retroviral introduc-

tion of NPM–ALK with GFP coexpression followed by IL3 withdrawal. We hypothesized simultaneous IL3 withdrawal and ALKinhibitor exposure would require progressively higher NPM–ALK
levels to permit survival in the presence of drug. Figure 3A shows
representative percentage GFP enrichment in one of three replicate experiments 4 days after IL3 withdrawal and incubation in 0,
10, 20, 50, 150, or 500 nmol/L ceritinib. Conﬁrming NPM–ALK
dependence, cells withdrawn in the two highest concentrations
always died, whereas the others proliferated only as 100% GFPþ
lines. In addition, cells infected with empty vector invariably
perished after IL3 withdrawal (not shown). Flow-cytometry analysis showed progressively brighter GFP coexpression in the transformed cells selected and maintained in higher ceritinib concentrations (Fig. 3B), and qPCR conﬁrmed increased NPM–ALK
mRNA (Fig. 3C). By immunoblot, we observed progressively
higher NPM–ALK total protein and phosphorylation, showing
again selection for increased ALK expression and activity to permit
survival of NPM–ALK-dependent cells during TKI exposure (Fig.

3D). We then washed cells selected and maintained in 50 nmol/L
ceritinib out of drug, plated them in drug-free media, and compared their proliferation with the same cells maintained in drug.
The cells deprived of drug had signiﬁcantly reduced proliferation
(Fig. 3E). Therefore, an independent system conﬁrmed both
selection for increased NPM–ALK expression to mediate TKI
resistance and the negative impact on cell ﬁtness of this increased
expression in TKI absence.

Cells return NPM–ALK to basal levels to permit growth without
ALK inhibition
To identify factors permitting resistant-dependent cells to
resume growth without ALK inhibition, we attempted to derive
lines with this phenotype in vitro. Invariably, plating resistant cells
at <106/mL without ALK inhibitor resulted in complete death of
the culture plate (data not shown). At concentrations 106/mL,
however, we eventually isolated clones from resistant-dependent

S1, range 4–56 days). Designated RS for resensitized (K299CRS, K299-LRS, SUP-CRS, and SUP-LRS), these lines lacked
viability stimulation by either ALK inhibitor (Fig. 4A). Proliferation assays showed ability to grow again without drug but
resensitization to both ALK inhibitors in all RS lines (Fig. 4B).
The RS lines, like parent cells, were less apoptotic in drug-free
media than in either ALK inhibitor (Fig. 4C). These clones
therefore lost ability to proliferate in ALK TKIs as they
regained ability to grow without drug. [Note: ALK TKI resistance mutations detected in SUP-CRS and SUP-LRS (Supplementary Table S2), which likely shifted their viability curves
compared with parent cells in Fig. 4A, were not sufﬁcient to
restore proliferation or avoid apoptosis during drug exposure.]
LI-WGS of K299-CRS showed no genomic ampliﬁcation of
NPM–ALK (Fig. 4D), and copy-number assays showed K299CRS and K299-LRS have the NPM–ALK translocation at the
same copy-number as the original parent (Fig. 4E). The RS
subclones all returned NPM–ALK mRNA (Fig. 4G) and protein
(Supplementary Fig. S3) to approximately the same levels as
those in the corresponding original parent cells. Return of ALK
activity to baseline therefore appears necessary for resistant
subclones to resume proliferation in an absence of an ALK
inhibitor. Simultaneous resensitization to drug that results
from this return to baseline strongly validates the conclusion
that ALK overdose drives both resistance to and dependence
on TKIs.
We also re-selected K299-CRS cells for crizotinib resistance and
obtained a secondary resistant clone able to grow at 1,000 nmol/L
(K299-CR1000-2). Strikingly, the resistance selection took just as
long as the original selection of Karpas-299 cells and again
resulted in NPM–ALK copy-number gain, increased mRNA
expression, and the resistant-dependent phenotype (Supplementary Fig. S4). Again no mutations were acquired within the ALK
kinase domain (Supplementary Table S2). This further demonstrates the great difﬁculty ALKþ ALCL cells have in gaining an ALKindependent means of survival.
ALK overdose prevents tumor engraftment without TKI
treatment in vivo and permits prolonged tumor control through
discontinuous dosing
Our data suggest withdrawal of drug from ALKþ ALCL
patients with TKI resistance due to target upregulation may
promote tumor regression due to ALK overdose. We therefore
xenografted K299-CR1000 cells to SCID mice, immediately
began treatment with vehicle or ceritinib (50 mg/kg, n ¼ 5
per group), and followed tumor volume (Fig. 5A). No vehicletreated animals experienced tumor engraftment, whereas three
of ﬁve ceritinib animals did. On day 62, we discontinued
ceritinib treatment, resulting in tumor regression in all
engrafted mice (Fig. 5B). Tumors began growing again, however, after about 25 days. We followed them until the tumor
burden of one mouse approached 2,000 mm3, at which point
we took tumor samples for in vitro culture and then resumed
ceritinib therapy. We successfully cultured the cells from two of
the three mice. Strikingly, cells from both animals had all the
characteristics of the in vitro RS subclones (Fig. 4), including no
viability stimulation by either ALK TKI (Fig. 5C), ability to
proliferate in vehicle but not either ALK inhibitor (Fig. 5D), loss
of the NPM–ALK copy-number gain (Fig. 5E), and return of
NPM–ALK mRNA expression to the baseline of the original

Karpass-299 parent line (Fig. 5F). Consistent with resensitization, ceritinib resumption halted the growth of tumors in all
three mice, with two experiencing tumor reduction over the
next 22 days when the experiment ended (Fig. 5B). The third
tumor began growing again after 12 days despite the ongoing
ceritinib therapy. These results show proof of principle that
discontinuous dosing in vivo can take cells through full cycles
of ALK TKI dependence and sensitivity and can prolong
tumor control in host animals bearing tumors with resistance
driven by ALK overexpression. Up-front comparison of intermittent versus continuous in SCID mice engrafted with parental
Karpas-299 xenografts did not generate relapses in any
group at effective treatment doses (Supplementary Fig. S5),
however, showing a need to interrogate ALK expression in
resistant tumors before attempting discontinuous dosing (see
Discussion).

Discussion
ALK-kinase inhibition is an important new treatment modality
for the subset of NSCLC cases containing ALK rearrangements, but
median progression-free survival has ranged from 7 to 10 months
during treatment with crizotinib or ceritinib (10, 13, 38). Targetindependent resistance is common, as target-dependent mechanisms such second-site kinase-domain mutations are detectable in
fewer than half of resistant samples and even then activation of
alternate signaling may also be present (14, 18, 19). The small
number of ALKþ ALCL patients treated to date with ALK TKIs has
not permitted determination of typical progression-free survival,
and resistant clinical samples are not yet available for assessment
(16, 17). In this study, we have attempted to predict resistance
pathways using laboratory-based selections, an approach that has
identiﬁed clinically relevant reasons for targeted drug failure in
numerous cancer types (39–42).
Our results suggest a much stronger addiction to ALK signaling
in ALCL than observed in NSCLC. Multiple-independent selections performed with both crizotinib and ceritinib resulted in
upregulation of NPM–ALK to permit survival in the presence of
inhibitor, and there was no clear evidence of alternate signaling
able to bypass it. Even re-selection of cells already selected for
resistance once, but which lost resistance in order to avoid the
toxic effects of ALK overdose, again generated ALK upregulation
(Supplementary Fig. S4). All resistant lines preserved ALK activation in the presence of inhibitor, though preservation was stronger
in some than in others (K299 subclones vs. the others in Fig. 2E),
whereas STAT3 activation was strongly preserved in all. It is
therefore possible additional mechanisms preserving STAT3 activation arose in some cases, though this was not observed after
lines were reselected for ability to grow without inhibitor. Either
way, we ﬁnd the effect of ALK signaling intensity on cell survival
exists as an inverted U-shaped curve, which we represent schematically in Fig. 6. NPM–ALK overexpression associated with
genomic ampliﬁcation in the case of resistant clones derived from
Karpas-299 and without ampliﬁcation in other clones. The consistent results with Karpas-299 suggest this line might have a
subpopulation with NPM–ALK ampliﬁcation at baseline. Such
population is then most able to upregulate expression from a
tolerable prosurvival baseline to the levels necessary to overcome
high concentrations of inhibitor. Even in the resistant NPM–ALKampliﬁed K299-CR1000 clone, however, a subpopulation without the ampliﬁcation appears to persist, because it reemerges

ALK TKI Resistance Leads to Oncogene Overdose in Lymphoma

Figure 6.
Schematic of ALK dosage and cell viability. A narrow range of ALK activity

withdrawal of TKI from resistant cells with ALK upregulation drives cells into
dynamic states of lost viability, ending in death—but for opposite reasons of
ALK signaling dosage.

upon selection for ability to grow again without inhibitor. Another possibility is that the ampliﬁcation arises extra-chromosomally
(e.g., as a double-minute chromosome), which is then lost
through chromosomal segregation during selection for growth
without inhibitor. Either way, the overexpression without ampliﬁcation in other resistant clones show additional genetic and/or
epigenetic mechanisms can arise to drive overexpression. Geneexpression proﬁling, unbiased interrogation of signaling through
phosphoproteomics, and subsequent functional studies are needed to fully determine these mechanisms and also the mechanisms
by which ALK-overdose leads to cell death.
Consistent and reproducible selection for increased NPM–ALK
in multiple models of ALKþ ALCL we believe may be therapeutically exploitable, with potential application to additional malignancies in which ALK has an established or potential role (4).
Therapeutic strategies of inhibitor withdrawal from patients with
resistant tumors and up-front schedules of intermittent dosing are
approaches carrying far less toxicity and expense than almost any
other strategy aimed at overcoming resistance. Our results (Fig. 5)
support the former in cases when ALK overexpression is suspected
or, preferably, can be speciﬁcally detected. Unlike similar results
reported recently for BRAF-driven melanoma (43); however, we
did not prolong control in the up-front setting with intermittent
dosing (Supplementary Fig. S5). These results, however, do not
fully interrogate the strategy since no relapses were observed,
which is out of line with expected patient experience, especially in
those receiving ALK inhibitors as salvage therapy. Major progress
toward producing a phenotypically accurate murine model of
ALKþ ALCL came recently with demonstration that CRISPR/
CAS9-mediated chromosomal breaks can generate NPM–ALK in
murine ﬁbroblasts (44). The same report showed retroviral introduction of guide strands generating breaks for EML4–ALK into
mouse lungs generated a highly accurate model of ALKþ NSCLC.
Efforts are underway by several groups including ours to apply
these techniques in generation of a new model for ALKþ ALCL.

www.aacrjournals.org

Evaluation of up-front intermittent dosing and discontinuous
dosing in the setting of acquired resistance when such a system
becomes available are justiﬁed by our ﬁndings. It also will permit
studies of the mechanisms of ALK-overdose toxicity and of non–
ampliﬁcation-driven NPM–ALK overexpression in a physiologically accurate immunocompetent model system.
Important questions raised by our data include those of
broader applicability. In lung cancer, EML4-ALK copy-number
gain and increased expression are reported in association with
crizotinib resistance (18, 19). There are recent case reports of ALKþ
NSCLC patients who became refractory to crizotinib obtaining
secondary responses upon re-challenge after a period off the drug
(45, 46). Both patients, however, received chemotherapy upon
initial crizotinib discontinuation, so we do not know if ALK
overdose was present or might have led to spontaneous regressions if they had been observed without therapy. Another case
series found continuing crizotinib treatment despite progression
led to higher performance status than discontinuation (47), but
no study has addressed the question of whether therapy interruption may beneﬁt some patients based on the particular resistance mechanism(s) present in their tumors. In other cancers with
known or potential ALK activation, evaluation of ALK inhibition
is at early stages with results largely unreported. We encourage
careful evaluation for changes in ALK signaling dosage during ALK
inhibitor therapy in ongoing and planned trials. Patients who
come off therapy and subsequently experience regression should
be assessed for the potential role of ALK overdose in these
ﬁndings.
In sum, ALK activity can exist as a double-edged sword for
cancer cells. Those tumors that are most addicted to its activities for continued proliferation correspondingly are most
prone to select for higher expression to bypass its inhibition.
Interruption of inhibition would then provide a new way of
prolonging tumor control as the other edge of the sword comes
into play.
