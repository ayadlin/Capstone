BACKGROUND: Both concomitant chemotherapy and altered fractionation radiotherapy (RT) have been shown to
improve outcomes for patients with locoregionally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. However,
both strategies also increase acute toxicity, and it is questionable whether the 2 can be safely combined. Traditional
concomitant chemotherapy regimens include high-dose cisplatin given at 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. The authors’
purpose was to report efficacy and toxicity after weekly cisplatin (30 mg/m2/wk) concurrent with altered fractionation RT. METHODS: One hundred twenty-one patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer stages II (3%), III
(13%), or IV (84%) squamous cell carcinomas of the oropharynx (70%), hypopharynx (20%), or larynx (10%) were
treated between 2000 and 2006 at the University of Florida with hyperfractionated RT (55 patients) or concomitant
boost RT (66 patients) and concomitant cisplatin (30 mg/m2/wk). RESULTS: Median follow-up was 2.9 years; median
follow-up on survivors was 3.6 years. Seventy-nine percent of patients completed 6 cycles of chemotherapy; 94%
received 7200 centigrays. Seven (6%) patients changed from cisplatin to carboplatin because of bone marrow toxicity. Gastrostomy tube feeding was required in 54% of patients either before (16%) or during RT (38%). Two (1.6%)
patients died from therapy-related complications. The 5-year outcomes were: local control, 83%; locoregional control,
79%; distant metastasis-free survival, 88%; cause-specific survival, 76%; and overall survival, 59%. Seven (6%) patients
had severe late complications. Three (3%) patients required a permanent gastrostomy tube. CONCLUSIONS:
Concomitant weekly cisplatin with altered fractionation RT is a safe and effective treatment regimen. Cancer

KEYWORDS: cisplatin, outcomes, radiotherapy, head and neck cancer.

Locoregional control and overall survival have improved for patients with locoregionally advanced head and neck
cancers because of advancements in the delivery of radiotherapy (RT) and concomitant chemotherapy. Meta-analyses
have shown that concomitant chemotherapy and RT improve outcomes compared with RT alone, maintenance chemotherapy, or historical regimens of induction chemotherapy.1-3 In addition, recent randomized trials have shown an advantage of altered fractionation over conventional once daily RT.3-6 The 2 regimens resulting in improved outcomes are
hyperfractionated RT and concomitant boost RT, as demonstrated in the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)
90-03 trial.5 Yet whether altered fractionation can be successfully combined with concomitant chemotherapy to improve
the therapeutic ratio without undue increased toxicity remains unknown.
Cisplatin is commonly used in the treatment of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. It is synergistic
when combined with RT. The most widely tested regimen for single-agent cisplatin in this population is 100 mg/m2 once
every 3 weeks for 2 to 3 cycles.7-9 This high-dose regimen has been associated with grade 3-4 mucosal and hematologic
toxicity exceeding 40% and sometimes requires RT treatment breaks or cessation of chemotherapy. Data suggest that
treatment breaks are associated with reduced disease control, and some physicians have sought alternatives to the highdose cisplatin regimen.10-12

Although the cumulative cisplatin dose remains
unaltered at approximately 210 mg/m2, lower and radiosensitizing doses of cisplatin may minimize its toxicity.
Daily doses of cisplatin at 6 mg/m2 concurrent with RT
have been evaluated with success in Europe.12 Weekly
doses of cisplatin are used with success in cervical cancer,
but have not been tested prospectively for head and neck
cancer.13 At the University of Florida, we used weekly cisplatin at 30 mg/m2/wk concurrent with altered fractionation RT (either hyperfractionation or the concomitant
boost technique) in an attempt to reduce the mucosal, hematologic, and renal toxicities of concomitant chemotherapy while maintaining its therapeutic effect. Herein we
report our experience with this treatment plan.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We retrospectively identified 121 consecutive patients
with previously untreated squamous cell carcinomas of
the head and neck curatively treated at the University of
Florida with weekly cisplatin and concomitant RT
between 2000 and 2006. Patients treated with definitive
RT at our institution for stage III to IV head and neck
squamous cell carcinomas are almost always treated with
altered fractionation and concomitant weekly cisplatin, so
that this represents a relatively unselected series. Only
patients with oropharyngeal (70%), hypopharyngeal

(20%), and laryngeal (10%) primaries were included. A
prophylactic gastrostomy tube was placed in 19 (16%)
patients before they started treatment. Patients were
staged according to the 2002 American Joint Committee
on Cancer staging system.14 Table 1 shows patient and tumor characteristics.
Radiotherapy
Sixty-six (55%) patients were treated with concomitant
boost RT (7200 centigrays [cGy] in 42 fractions over 6
weeks), and 55 (45%) patients were treated twice daily
(median 7440 cGy/62 fractions over 6.5 weeks). Eighteen
(33%) of 55 patients treated with hyperfractionation
received >74.4 Gy. During each cisplatin administration,
patients received 1 L of saline and 10 to 20 potassium
chloride before and after the cisplatin, which was administered in 500 mL to 1 L of saline. Patients also usually
received 20 mg of furosemide (Lasix). Table 2 shows the
treatment details. Intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) is
used in lieu of conventional techniques in the treatment
of head and neck cancer at the University of Florida if: 1)
the target delineation requires a concave isodose distribution to spare a critical structure; 2) salivary preservation is
an option in cases of unilateral adenopathy where we need
to treat the retrostyloid nodes on the ipsilateral side of the
tumor, but can avoid the contralateral retrostyloid nodes
and thus spare the parotid; and 3) the primary tumor
extends inferiorly below the level of the shoulders, and we
need to avoid the shoulders to adequately irradiate the tumor.15 When IMRT is used, we prefer the concomitant
boost treatment schedule for logistical purposes. The
standard risk planning target volume (PTV) included
areas at risk for subclinical disease and gross disease; the
subclinical disease received 49.5 Gy at 1.65 Gy per fraction, and the gross disease received 54 Gy at 1.8 Gy per
fraction. On treatment Days 19 through 30, the high-risk

PTV containing the gross disease received 18 Gy at 1.5
Gy per fraction as a concomitant boost with a minimum
6-hour interfraction interval. Hyperfractionation was
used with 1.2 Gy per twice-daily fraction with a minimum 6-hour interfraction interval for patients treated
with conventional RT. The final dose was usually 74.4 Gy
at 62 twice-daily fractions; 18 patients received >74.4
Gy. This schedule has been used at our institution since
1978.
Chemotherapy
Intravenous cisplatin was administered at a weekly dose of
30 mg/m2 for all 121 patients. Three patients received 20
mg/m2/wk because of medical comorbidities at the discretion of the medical oncologist. Weekly cisplatin began the
first week of RT and continued weekly, typically for 6 to
6.5 weeks. In the case of grade 3-4 hematologic or mucosal toxicity, cisplatin is withheld with the specific intent of
not interrupting RT.
Post-Treatment Assessment
Patients are formally evaluated by computed tomography
(CT) and physical examination 4 weeks after completing
treatment. Neck dissection is recommended if there is palpable residual lymphadenopathy, if cervical nodes measure >1.5 cm in the axial dimension, or if filling defects
are present on a contrast-enhanced CT scan.16 If indicated, dissection is performed 6 weeks after completing
chemoradiotherapy. Patients are then followed every 4 to
8 weeks during the first year, every 2 to 4 months for an
additional 2 years, biannually until 5 years, and annually
thereafter. Gastrostomy tubes are removed when patients
are able to maintain their weight without the tube.
Median follow-up for all patients was 2.7 years
(range, 0.1-7.9 years); median follow-up on survivors was
3.6 years (range, 1.1-7.9 years).
Statistical Evaluation
All statistical analyses were performed with SAS and JMP
software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The Kaplan-Meier
product-limit method provided estimates of selected endpoints.17 For each endpoint, the log-rank test statistic provided an analysis of the prognostic significance of: T
classification (T1-T2 vs T3-T4), overall stage (II-III vs
IV), tumor site (larynx vs oropharynx vs hypopharynx),
cycles of chemotherapy (< vs 6 cycles), and fractionation schedule (hyperfractionation vs concomitant boost).
With the exception of fractionation schedule, these same
prognostic factors were assessed in the multivariate analy-

the most parsimonious final predictive model.18

RESULTS
Ninety-seven (80%) patients were able to complete at
least 6 cycles of weekly chemotherapy. Seven patients
required a switch from cisplatin to carboplatin; 6 completed at least 6 cycles of chemotherapy. Reasons that
patients did not complete the prescribed chemotherapy
included: hematologic toxicity, 85%; nausea and vomiting, 8%; and 1 patient each with poor venous access and
request to discontinue chemotherapy. There were no
grade 3-4 renal toxicities.
One-hundred seventeen (97%) patients received
7200 cGy. Seventeen (14%) patients had RT treatment
delay complications, most of which lasted 1 or 2 days
(57%). The longest treatment delay was a 7-day treatment
break because of admission to an outside hospital.
Grade 3 acute toxicities based on the RTOG Acute
Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria were: anemia, 7
(6%) patients; thrombocytopenia, 3 (2%) patients; leucopenia, 33 (27%) patients; and >15% weight loss, 41
(34%) patients. The overall gastrostomy tube rate was
54%; 16% were planned before treatment, and 38% were
required during the course of treatment.
Three patients experienced fatal toxicities. Two died
before completing their treatment secondary to complications of bowel perforation with fatal peritonitis. The first
had confirmed Clostridium difficile colitis before perforation, and the second had spontaneous bowel perforation
and could not tolerate a surgical procedure secondary to
thrombocytopenia. The third patient developed laryngeal
necrosis, which responded poorly to conservative measures, including steroids and hyperbaric oxygen. He
received 7200 cGy with the concomitant boost schedule
and 6 cycles of weekly cisplatin followed 1 month later by
a unilateral neck dissection. A tracheostomy was performed 7 months after completing chemoradiotherapy. A
wound dehiscence developed followed by carotid artery
blowout 1 month after tracheostomy and 8 months after
completing chemoradiotherapy.
Indications for post-treatment neck dissection are
discussed above. On the basis of these indications, 52
(43%) patients had a neck dissection; 45 were unilateral,
and 7 were bilateral. Forty-two (81%) of 52 heminecks
had no evidence of cancer on pathologic review. Of the
patients with bilateral neck dissections, 2 had positive
lymph nodes (positive unilaterally, 1 patient; positive

cGy, given by hyperfractionation. The patient with clavicular head necrosis received 5000 cGy to the lower neck,
given as 200 cGy per fraction once daily with a single anterior-posterior low anterior neck field. He received a
right neck dissection at 6 weeks, which was negative. He
continued to smoke cigarettes and cigars after treatment.
The necrosis was surgically excised 1 year after completing
chemoradiotherapy; he did not have further complications with treatment.

bilaterally, 2 patients). Of the patients who had a neck dissection, 90% remained regionally controlled, and only 2
later failed in the neck.
The 5-year outcomes were: local control, 83%;
locoregional control, 79%; distant metastasis-free survival, 88%; cause-specific survival, 76%; and overall survival, 59% (Figs. 1 and 2). Multivariate analyses of
outcomes are depicted in Table 3. The only parameter
that significantly influenced outcome was T classification.
Late toxicity was graded according to the Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 3.0 scale.19
Overall, 6% of patients had a grade 4 late complication of
soft tissue, cartilage, or bone requiring surgical repair or
hyperbaric oxygen. One patient developed external auditory canal stenosis with bone exposure requiring surgical
repair with a split thickness skin grafting. After neck dissection, 1 patient had a wound dehiscence with necrosis
and was effectively treated with hyperbaric oxygen and
surgical repair. Five others also developed necrosis: 2 oropharyngeal mucosal necrosis, 2 laryngeal cartilage necrosis, and 1 clavicular head necrosis. Treatments included
hyperbaric oxygen and/or surgical resection of necrotic

DISCUSSION
The ideal treatment for patients with locoregionally
advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
remains unknown. Several lessons have been learned from
50 years of prospective randomized trials and multiple
recent meta-analyses. Table 4 compares our outcomes to
3 other trials of altered fractionation and concomitant cisplatin chemotherapy.

Includes grade 3 toxicity.

Altered Fractionation
The rationale for altered fractionation is based on the dissociation between acute and late effects. The goal is to
improve the likelihood of a cure and decrease the probability of a late complication. Pure hyperfractionated RT
consists of multiple, small (1.1-1.3 Gy) daily fractions to
achieve a greater total dose within the same time as conventionally fractionated RT. Accelerated RT consists of
multiple, daily fractions using the same dose per fraction,
to achieve an equivalent dose within a shorter treatment
time. In practice, most altered fractionation schedules are
a hybrid of hyperfractionation and accelerated
fractionation.
The landmark RTOG 90-03 study randomized
patients to hyperfractionated RT (HFX, 81.6 Gy at 1.2
Gy per twice-daily fraction over 7 weeks), accelerated
split-course RT (67.2 Gy at 1.6 Gy per twice-daily fraction over 6 weeks), accelerated concomitant boost RT (72
Gy at 1.8-1.5 Gy per fraction over 6 weeks with twicedaily RT given over the last 12 treatment days), or standard RT (70 Gy in 35 once-daily fractions over 7 weeks).5
Patients treated with HFX and accelerated concomitant
boost RT had significantly better locoregional control and
disease-free survival rates compared with those treated
with standard RT. Disease-free survival rates at 5 years
were 21%, 30.7%, and 28.9% for standard RT, HFX,
and accelerated concomitant boost RT, respectively.
There was a trend toward improved overall survival for
the HFX arm (37.1% vs 29.5%; P ¼ .063). All 3 altered
fractionation schedules resulted in increased acute toxicity
compared with standard RT. There was a trend toward
increased late effects after accelerated concomitant boost
RT compared with standard RT (33.3% vs 25.2%; P ¼

.066). The rates of late effects for HFX (27.4%) and accelerated split-course RT (26.8%) were similar to those
observed in the control arm. Because hyperfractionation is
more costly and labor-intensive, the RTOG has recommended accelerated concomitant boost RT as the new
standard in this patient population.
As discussed above, hyperfractionation and the concomitant boost technique are used with equal frequency
at our institution. Fractionation is determined by whether
IMRT will be used. In addition, we avoid using the concomitant boost schedule for lesions involving the skull
base, such as the nasopharynx and paranasal sinuses,
because of the increased risk of late complications
observed in the RTOG-90-03 study. A previously published report discusses our experience with IMRT in head
and neck cancer.15
Univariate analysis showed no difference regarding a
relationship between fractionation and our control or survival outcome parameters. Likewise, late toxicities were
distributed evenly between those who received hyperfractionation and the concomitant boost schedule. However,
those patients treated with hyperfractionation who had a
late complication were treated with 7680 cGy and 6
cycles of chemotherapy. No patient treated to 7440 cGy
with hyperfractionation had a severe late complication.
Thus, 7440 is our recommended dose for those treated
with hyperfractionation and concomitant chemotherapy.
This dose effect may explain the difference in toxicity seen
between our review and the Jeremic study, which evaluated hyperfractionation to 7700 cGy with concurrent
daily cisplatin.20 The standard arm in that study (hyperfractionation without chemotherapy) had a 6% rate of
severe late complications.

Adjuvant Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is administered with RT to improve locoregional control and survival in patients with stage III-IV
advanced head and neck cancer. The MACH-NC metaanalysis of 63 randomized trials (10,741 patients) published
between 1965 and 1993 revealed that adjuvant chemotherapy provided a 4% improvement (P < .0001) in 5-year
overall survival.1 This benefit was limited to those who
received concomitant chemotherapy (8%; P < .001) and
was not observed in patients who received induction or
maintenance chemotherapy. This report was criticized for its
heterogeneity and was recently updated2 to include 24 new
trials, 85% of which explore concomitant chemotherapy.
The results were unchanged: 1) there was an 8% improvement in overall survival with concomitant chemotherapy; 2)
maintenance and induction schedules did not offer a significant survival benefit; 3) all tumor sites benefited; 4) platinum-containing regimens showed the greatest benefit (an
11% 5-year overall survival advantage); and 5) there was no
difference between poly- and monochemotherapy.
Budach and coworkers published a meta-analysis of
modern chemotherapy regimens and curative intent RT
doses (>60 Gy). The analysis included 32 trials (10,225
patients) published between 1975 and 2003.3 Their
report showed an overall survival benefit of 12 months for
chemotherapy concurrent with conventional or altered
fractionation RT.
Recent RTOG studies (RTOG-9914 and -0129)
evaluate 2 cycles of high-dose cisplatin, at a cumulative
dose of 200 mg/m2, combined with concomitant boost
RT.21,22 The long-term outcomes of the phase 2 RTOG9914 study were published, and a toxicity report is available for RTOG-0129. The results of RTOG-9914 show
that 86% of patients completed the protocol treatment.
The 4-year local control, disease-free survival, and overall
survival were 64.4%, 48.5%, and 53.6%, respectively.
There was a 21% incidence of distant metastases.
Nonstandard cisplatin regimens used to achieve the
same cumulative dose (200 mg/m2) given at lower, radiosensitizing doses are intriguing. Jeremic and coworkers have
performed 2 prospective trials showing an advantage for
low-dose daily cisplatin (6 mg/m2) with RT compared with
RT alone.12,20 Their second study randomized patients to
hyperfractionation (1.1 Gy twice daily to 77 Gy) with concurrent low-dose daily cisplatin versus hyperfractionation
alone. The 5-year locoregional control rates were 58% versus 40% (P ¼ .0013), and the overall survival rates were
46% versus 25% (P ¼ .0075), for the chemoradiation arm
and RT-alone arms, respectively. They note a 49% versus

4538

42% incidence in all acute grade 3-4 toxicities and 12% versus 6% incidence of grade 3-4 late toxicities, respectively.
Concurrent Cisplatin and Altered
Fractionation Radiotherapy
Weekly cisplatin, given 30 mg/m2/wk to a cumulative
dose of 180 to 210 mg/m2 concurrent with RT, has not
been prospectively tested in head and neck cancer, but has
been used with success in other squamous cell carcinoma
disease sites.13 In our report, treatment tolerability and
overall efficacy compare favorably to both the Jeremic
study of daily cisplatin with hyperfractionation as well as
the RTOG-9914 and RTOG-0129 studies (see Table 4).
Seventy-nine percent of our patients were able to complete the chemotherapy treatment course; 95% were able
to receive >7200 cGy.
Improvements in treatment outcomes must be
weighed against toxicity. Toxicities with weekly cisplatin
are quite low. We observed no cases of grade 3-4 renal
impairment. Ang et al reported a 12% rate of grade 3-4 renal impairment and 1 grade 5 renal-associated toxicity in
patients treated with a high-dose cisplatin regimen.23 Leucopenia has been seen in all of the cisplatin dosing schedules.12,20,21,23 With mucosal or hematologic toxicities,
our preference is to continue RT and defer chemotherapy
until its acute effects are appropriately resolved. An
advantage to weekly administration is that it enables the
chemotherapy to be discontinued if there is significant
toxicity. Titrating chemotherapy to avoid a severe acute
toxicity reduces the risk of a severe late complication.
With respect to toxicity evaluation and scoring, we are
sensitive to the inherent observational bias of retrospective
studies. However, if properly recorded, outcomes such as
gastrostomy tube rate, surgical interventions, and utilization
of hyperbaric oxygen may be useful in spotting trends associated with a treatment schedule. We have a low rate of gastrostomy tube placement at the end of treatment, and it is
markedly lower at 1 year. IMRT was not allowed in the
RTOG studies, whereas half of our patients were treated
with IMRT. Success with swallowing rehabilitation may be
associated with sparing of the pharyngeal constrictor
muscles coincidental to contralateral parotid-sparing techniques. In addition, our institution is proactive with its swallow rehabilitation program, which is a planned component
of each patient’s treatment course, and coaches patients to
have gastrostomy tubes removed in a timely manner.
Grade 4 toxicities in this report included soft-tissue,
cartilage, and bone necrosis. An analysis by the RTOG
reviewed factors associated with severe late toxicity after

concurrent chemoradiation for head and neck cancer.24
They showed that significant correlates with the development of severe late toxicities are older age, advanced T classification, larynx/hypopharynx primary site, and neck
dissection after chemoradiotherapy. The same factors are
shared by patients who experienced late toxicities in our
cohort. The most preventable among these was toxicity
associated with neck dissection. As demonstrated above,
81% of our patients had no pathologic evidence of disease
at the time of neck dissection, highlighting our excellent
locoregional control rates and, more importantly, the need
for diagnostic improvements to spare patients the potential
morbidity associated with neck dissection. Most late toxicities observed are manageable, and most patients will accept
the risks of toxicity for an improved chance at cure.

CONCLUSIONS
Altered fractionation RT with concurrent weekly cisplatin
is safe and effective in this patient population. We recommend concurrent weekly cisplatin (30 mg/m2) and altered
fractionation RT. An RT dose >7440 cGy is associated
with increased toxicity. A concomitant boost prescription
(72 Gy/42 fractions/30 treatment days) is used with
IMRT when the goal is salivary preservation or when the
PTV extends below the level of the shoulders. Otherwise,
hyperfractionation to 7440 cGy is recommended, given at
120 cGy twice daily. Patients whose medical comorbidities are a contraindication for cisplatin are evaluated for
concurrent cetuximab or carboplatin. In the event of
grade 3-4 toxicity, chemotherapy is postponed to avoid
RT treatment breaks. Computed tomography (CT) is
obtained 1 month post-RT to determine whether to add a
planned neck dissection if the risk of residual regional disease is thought to exceed 5%. Patients suspected of harboring residual regional disease may be considered for
positron emission tomography-CT 3 months post-RT to
determine whether the planned neck dissection can be
safely withheld.
