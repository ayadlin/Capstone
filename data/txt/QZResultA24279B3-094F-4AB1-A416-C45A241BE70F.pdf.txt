ABSTRACT
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are associated with cancer recurrence and metastasis.
Prostate cancer cells often metastasize to the bone with a complex microenvironment
of cytokines favoring cell survival. In this study, the cell stemness influence of a
group of interleukins including IL-3, 6, 10, 11 and 24 on human prostate cancer cell
lines LNCaP and PC-3 was explored in vitro. Sulforhodamine B(SRB) and 5-ethynyl2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) assays were applied to examine the effect on cell proliferation,
and wound healing and transwell assays were used for migration and invasion studies,
in addition to colony formation, Western blotting and flowcytometry for the expression
of stemness factors and chemotherapy sensitivity. We observed that ILs-3, 6 and
11 stimulated while ILs-10 and 24 inhibited the growth, invasion and migration of
both cell lines. Interestingly, ILs-3, 6 and 11 significantly promoted colony formation
and increased the expression of SOX2, CD44 and ABCG2 in both prostate cancer cell
lines. However, ILs-10 and 24 showed the opposite effect on the expression of these
factors. In line with the above findings, treatment with either IL-3 or IL-6 or IL-11
decreased the chemosensitivity to docetaxel while treatment with either IL-10 or
IL-24 increased the sensitivity of docetaxel chemotherapy. In conclusion, our results
suggest that ILs-3, 6 and 11 function as tumor promoters while ILs-10 and 24 function
as tumor suppressors in the prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and LNCaP in vitro, and
such differences may attribute to their different effect on the stemness of PCa cells.

prostectomy has been the gold standard therapy. Often PCa
patients have a progression without clinical symptoms and
the disease is detected in advanced stages.
The standard treatment for patients with primary
hormone-dependent prostate cancer is endocrine therapy,
and the treatment originally inhibits tumor growth. However,
nearly all patients who received this treatment will ultimately

evidence indicates that there are cancer stem cells (CSCs)
survived in circulating system or bone marrow of prostate
cancer patients, which attribute to therapy-resistant and
relapse [5–7]. The most notable features of these multipotent
and self-renewing cells are their high survival capability and
high resistance to chemotherapy.
CSCs are driving force for the onset, development
and progression of various cancers. Recent studies point
to the possibility that a number of cytokines in the tumor
microenviroment [8, 9] influence the stemness of cancer
cells and CSC properties, and the growth and metastasis
of tumors [10–12].
It is believed that conventional treatment options
eradicate the bulk of more differentiated tumor cell
clones. However, CSCs survive most of the classical
chemotherapy regimens and contribute to the tumor
progression and recurrence [13–15].
Interleukins (ILs) are a subgroup of cytokines
being primarily reported in leukocytes. IL-3 is produced
in activated T cells and mast cells, and influences the
production, differentiation and function of granulocytes
and macrophages [16, 17]. It has been reported that IL-3
receptor(IL-3R) overexpression on leukaemia stem cell
populations is a common occurrence, and therapeutic IL3-IL-3R interference option already shown promising [18].
And importantly, the IL-3R(CD123) had been considered
as a biomarker of leukemia stem cells [19, 20], although
contradictory results exist in the literature that IL-3 has
not direct relationship with the hematopoietic stem cells
(HSCs) [21], or breast cancer [22].
IL-6, also called B-cell stimulatory factor-2 and
interferon beta-2, is involved in different biological
functions, including B lymph cell differentiation and
myeloma and plasmacytoma growth [23, 24]. Recently, it
was observed that IL-6 is secreted from tumor-associated
macrophages (TAMs) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
and involved in the HCC tumorigenesis and also the CSC
expansion [25] . Similar findings are also reported in
human colon cancer [26] and malignant transformation of
rat mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) [27].
IL-10, another immunomodulatory cytokine,
had been used as vehicle of the neural stem/progenitor
cells (NSPCs) into the central nervous system (CNS) to
replace damaged cells and cure inflammation [28]. IL-10
is implicated in enhancing the ability of MSCs in antiinflammatory application [29] and hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HSCT) in treatment of the inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) [30]. Other studies have shown that
IL-10 may inhibit the growth and differentiation of neural
stem cells (NSCs) in normal adult brain [31], and help the
MSCs to inhibit the mature of dendritic cells (DCs) by
JAK1 and STAT3 signaling pathway [32].
IL-11 is also a secreted cytokine and involves in
megakaryocytopoiesis, platelet production, osteoclast
activation and inhibition of epithelial cell proliferation
and apoptosis [33]. IL-11 is active in peripheral blood
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

stem cell(PBSC) mobilisation [35]. Clinically, it has
been shown that IL-11 can decrease the occurrence of
the development of graft versus host disease (GVHD),
which is induced by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (allo-HSCT) [34].
Increasing evidence indicates that IL-24 may
suppress the growth of cancer stem cells. Further studies
revealed that IL-24 effectively inhibited proliferation and
angiogenesis of cancer cells, even reduce the percentage of
breast cancer-initiating/stem cells [36] and mesenchymal
stem cells (MSCs) [37] in vivo.
We have previously reported that granulocytemacrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and
colony stimulating factor(CSF) stimulate the stemness of
PCa cells [38]. In our present study, we have examined
the effect of different interleukins (IL-3,6,10,11 and
24) on the cell growth, migration, invasion, apoptosis,
colony formation capability and chemotherapy resistance
of the androgen-dependent LNCaP and the androgenindependent cell line PC-3 PCa cell lines, aiming to
explore whether these cytokines could influence the cell
stemness of the PCa cells in vitro.

RESULTS
The effect on cell growth
In order to study the proliferation effect of the ILs
on LNCaP and PC-3 cells, dose-dependent growth curves
were made. As shown in Figure 1A, dose-dependent
growth curves are not always lineage for all of these
ILs. However, it is apparently from this figure that 5 ng/
ml treatment is rather representative for all the ILs, and
5 ng/ml was therefore chosen to use for the following
experiments. Representative images of fluorescence
microscopy using the EdU incorporation and Hoechest
33342 for the cells treated for 24 hrs are shown in
Figure 1B. Histograms of the fluorescence microscopy
results are shown in Figure 1C and 1D for LNCaP and
PC-3 cells, respectively. It was found that 24 hrs treatment
with IL-3, IL-6 and IL-11 in 5 ng/ml significantly increased
the cell numbers in both cells lines, with p-values of 0.02,
0.037 and 0.032 in LNCaP cells, and p-values of 0.043,
0.029 and 0.029 in PC-3 cells, respectively. However, 24
hrs treatment of IL-10 and IL-24 in 5 ng/ml significantly
decreased the number of cells in both cell lines, with
p-values of 0.023 and 0.018 in LNCaP cells, and p-values
of 0.027and 0.029 in PC-3 cells, respectively. These results
indicate that IL-3, IL-6 and IL-11 significantly stimulate
the cell growth, while IL-10 and IL24 significantly inhibit
the cell growth in both cell lines.

treated with different ILs. Confluent monolayers of cells
were scratched to be wounded and cultured for 18 hrs
(Figure 2). Compared with the control cells, treatment
with IL-3, IL-6 and IL-11 demonstrated significantly
higher mobility in both cell lines, and the rates of wound
healing increased 10.2%(p = 0.046), 21.1%(p = 0.004) and
11.9% (p = 0.047) in LNCaP cells and 13.6%(p = 0.049)
30.4%(p = 0.045) and 16.1%(p = 0.040) in PC-3 cells,
respectively. But treatment with IL-10 and IL-24 showed
an inhibition effect on the wound healing in comparison to
the control cells, and the rates of wound healing decreased
with 20.8%(p = 0.008) and 39.3%(p = 0.031) in LNCaP
cells and 26.2%(p < 0.001) and 48.5%(p = 0.002) in PC-3
cells, respectively.

of both cell lines was increased when treated with IL-3,
IL-6 and IL-11, but decreased when treated with IL-10 and
IL-24 (Figure 3A and 3B). When cell migratory ability was
examined with the non-treated cells as controls in LNCaP
cells, 24 hrs of IL-3, IL-6 and IL-11 treatment significantly
increased the number of cells migrated through the membrane,
with increased rates of 13.2% ( p = 0.014), 65.3%( p = 0.014)
and 55.4%( p < 0.001), respectively. However, 24 hrs of IL10 and IL-24 treatment significantly decreased the number of
cells migrated through the membrane, and the migration rates
declined 25.3% and 40.0% with p = 0.002 and p < 0.001,
respectively. The migratory effect on PC-3 cells was similar.
Compared to the non-treated cells, 24 hrs of IL-3, IL-6 and
IL-11 treatment significantly increased the number of cells
migrated through the membrane with increased rates of
10.7% ( p = 0.002), 50.5% ( p = 0.004) and 41.2%( p = 0.002),
respectively, while 24 hrs treatment of IL-10 and IL-24
significantly decreased the number of cells migrated through
the membrane with decreased rates of 22.4% ( p = 0.007) and
24.7% ( p = 0.002), respectively(Figure 3C).

Migration and invasion effect

the migration and invasion effect of different ILs on LNCaP

For cell invasion examination where the membrane
was coated with 60 μL of matrigel, 24 hrs of IL-3, IL-6
and IL-11 treatment significantly increased the number
of invasive cells. Compared with the control cells,
the invasion rate increased 16.6% (p = 0.026), 39.5%
(p = 0.004) and 28.9% (p < 0.001) in the IL-3, IL-6 and
IL-11 treated LNCaP groups, and 16.3% (p = 0.017),
61.2% (p < 0.001) and 41.7% (p = 0.002) in the IL-3, IL-6
and IL-11 treated PC-3 groups, respectively. While 24
hrs of IL-10 and IL-24 treatment significantly decreased
the number of cells penetrated through the membrane in
both cell lines. Comparatively, the decreased invasion
rates were 27.7% (p = 0.044) and 33.6% (p = 0.015) in
the IL-10 and IL-24 treated LNCaP groups, and 27.7%
(p = 0.023) and 42.3% (p < 0.001) in the IL-10 and IL-24
treated PC-3 groups, respectively (Figure 3D).

examines by RT-PCR(Figure 5A). Compared with the
control groups, the expression of SOX2 mRNA was
increased when treated with IL-3, IL-6 and IL-11 in both
cells, while the expression of SOX2 mRNA when treated
with IL-10 and IL-24, was decreased. All the mRNA
level changes were consistent with the SOX2 protein
expression alterations revealed with Western blotting as
shown in Figure 5B. To further evaluate the expression
of SOX2 in both cells, especially the cellular localization
of SOX2, immunofluorescence microscopy of SOX2 was
performed (Figure 5C–5F). All positive staining of the
SOX2 in these cells was confined in the nuclei in both cell
lines. Quantification of the positive cell numbers revealed
similar results as demonstrated by RT-PCR (Figure 5A)
and Western blotting (Figure 5B).

Clonogenicity effect

The effect on chemotherapy resistance

The colony formation assay was carried out to
examine the clonogenicity effect of these cytokines.
Representative photos of the colony formation assay for
both cell lines are shown on Figure 6A, and corresponding
histograms of the results are shown on Figure 6B for
LNCaP cells, and Figure 6C for PC-3 cells. Compared
to the control cells, treatment of IL-3, IL-6 and IL-11
increased the number of clones by 18.6% (p = 0.005),
45.3% (p = 0.045) and 31.3% (p = 0.042) in LNCaP cells
as shown on Figure 6B, and by 22.6% (p = 0.021), 57.0%
(p = 0.027) and 43.3% (p = 0.001) in PC-3 cells as shown
on Figure 6C. However, treatment with IL10 and IL24
resulted in significantly fewer clones by 16.9% (p = 0.032)
and 31.4% (p = 0.030) as shown on Figure 6B for LNCaP
cells and 19.0% (p = 0.027) and 42.4% (p = 0.002) as
shown on Figure 6C for PC-3 cells, respectively.

The apoptotic effect of the ILs was firstly examined
by flow cytometry.
Compared with the control cells, significantly lower
numbers of apoptotic cells were seen in the cells treated
with IL-3, IL-6 and IL-11 for 24 hrs, with p-values of
0.049, 0.003 and 0.011 in LNCaP cells, and p-values of
0.012, 0.001 and 0.002 in PC-3 cells, respectively. But
treatment with IL-10 and IL-24 significantly increased
the number of apoptotic cells, with p-values of 0.045 and
0.001 in LNCaP cells, and p-values of 0.040 and 0.009 in
PC-3 cells, respectively (Figure 4).
The apoptotic effect of docetaxel on these cells
was further examined. After optimization of the dose,
10nmol/L concentration of docetaxel was applied in this
study. As shown in Figure 4, 24 hrs of docetaxel treatment
alone significantly increased the number of apoptotic cells
in these cell lines, with a p-value of 0.002 in LNCaP cells,
and a p-value of 0.010 in PC-3 cells.
Then we asked whether the application of such ILs
could influence the apoptosis influenced by docetaxel in
these cells by joint application of the ILs and docetaxel. It
was discovered that combination of docetaxel application
with either IL-3 or IL-6 or IL-11 significantly reduced
the numbers of apoptotic cells than those with docetaxel
application alone, with p-values of 0.001, 0.007 and 0.017
in LNCaP cells, and p-values of 0.014, 0.002 and 0.026 in
PC-3 cells, respectively. Also, the combination of docetaxel
and either IL10 or IL-24 could significantly increase the
number of apoptotic cells, with p-values of 0.001 and 0.024
in LNCaP cells, and p-values of 0.007 and 0.005 in PC-3
cells, respectively, indicating a chemo-sensitizing role of IL10 and IL-24 in docetaxel treatment in prostate cancer cells.

The effect on the expression of CD44 and
ABCG2
The effect of the interleukins on the expression of
CD44 and ABCG2 in LNCaP and PC-3 cells was examined
by flowcytometry. Typical photos of the flowcytometry
and corresponding histograms are shown on Figure 7A.
Compared with the control groups, IL-3, IL-6 and IL-11
application in LNCaP cells significantly increased the
expression of CD44 and ABCG2 with p-values of 0.042,
0.037 and 0.015 for CD44 expression and 0.001, < 0.001,
and 0.001 for ABCG2, respectively, while the IL-10 and
IL-24 application significantly decreased the expression
of CD 44 and ABCG2 with p-values of 0.003 and 0.015
for CD44, and 0.010 and 0.027 for ABCG2 as shown on
Figure 7B, 7C and 7D. Similar results for PC-3 cells were
obtained. Compared to the control PC-3 cells, IL-3, IL-6
and IL-11 application in PC-3 cells significantly activated
the expression of CD44 and ABCG2 with p-values of 0.017,
0.004 and 0.011 for CD44, and 0.001, 0.006 and 0.008 for
ABCG2, respectively. Again, the application of IL-10 and

adhesion. Increasing evidence points to the important roles
of ILs in the microenvironment of tumors. Tumors may
rapidly progress when the microenvironment is favorable,
and the tumor cells may develop dormancy when the
microenvironment allows for such a status. Tumor cell
dormancy and tumor cell micrometastasis are two major
issues for cancer treatment failure. Although it is known
that increasing tumor cell stemness is associated with the
features of tumor cell dormancy and micrometastases,
molecular mechanisms are still obsolete.

DISCUSSION
It is known the ILs, a subset of cytokines, actively
influence molecule signaling and cellular behavior
[41], such as cell proliferation, migration, invasion and

In our current study, the effect of ILs on cell
proliferation was examined by a SRB assay, and the results
show that IL-3, IL-6 and IL-11 all have similar role in
stimulating cell growth in the LNCaP and PC-3 cells. Wound
healing and transwell assays also show that these ILs promote
migration and invasion of these cells. The cells treated with
these ILs show significantly higher colony formation ability
and lower number of apoptotic cells, an indication of higher
cell stemness in these cells after ILs treatment. In deed, these
cells show increasing expression of stemness factors SOX2,
and CD44, in addition to the drug-resistant gene ABCG2.

Interestingly, it is already reported that IL-3 is one
of the primary factors capable of supporting the growth
and acting on early progenitors [42]. Injection of IL-3
in the peripheral blood can maintain more CD34(+) /
CD36(+) double-positive erythroid progenitors, which
can significantly mobilize the peripheral blood (MPB)
CD34(+) cells and increase the repopulating cells in
marrow [43]. Presence of IL-3 in cell cultures can support
the mesenchymal stem cells expansion of the irradiated
CD34(+) cells in vitro [44]. It has been suggested to
combine IL-3 and G-CSF injection in peripheral blood for

peripheral blood stem cell propagation and allogenic stem
cell transplantation [45, 46]. Recently, IL-3 hypersecretion
has been reported to be associated with cutaneous
B-lymphoblastic lymphoma [47]. Our study reveals
another aspect of IL-3 functions, namely stimulating the
stemness of prostate cancer cells.
IL-6 has been shown to be a major contributing factor
in growth and progression of ovarian cancer [48], celiac
disease [49] and neck squamous cell carcinoma [50]. It
has been reported that the early growth response 3(EGR3)
directly activates the excessive production of IL-6 in prostate
cancer and promoted the progression [51]. Autophagy, a
critical process for breast cancer stem cells (CSC), maintains
the cell stemness of breast CSC by regulating the secretion
of IL-6 [52]. Chang and co-workers [53] reported that
IL-6 induces the expression of OCT4/NANOG and then
activates the IGFIR to promote the progression of HBV [53].
Several reports show that IL-11 stimulate and accelerate the
development of ulcerative colitis[54,], promote the tumor
progression by activating the STAT3 and suppress the
antitumor immune response [55]. Furthermore, higher levels
of IL-11 expression have been reported in distant metastatic
gastric cancer cells [56]. The results are in line with our
present study showing that IL-6 and IL-11 stimulated the
stemness of prostate cancer cells in vitro.
On the contrary to the above findings for ILs-3, 6
and 11, we have demonstrated that IL-10 and IL-24 inhibit
the proliferation capability of LNCaP and PC-3 cells. All
other experiments for migration and invasion, colony
formation, chemotherapeutic effect and the expression of
stemness factors etc. show opposite results than using ILs3, 6, and 11, indicating that these two factors suppressed
the stemness of these cancer cells in vitro.
Contradictory observations for the role of IL-10 in
cancer have been reported. Beguelin and associates [57]
reported that IL-10 promotes tumor cell proliferation
and survival by STAT3 signal pathway, and blocking
of IL-10 receptor was suggested as a novel therapeutic
target in diffused large B-cell lymphoma [57]. Others
have reported that absence of IL-10 to increase the risk
of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia occurrence (ALL) [58],
and the polymorphisms of IL-10 may be associated with
an increasing risk of colorectal cancer [59]. Nevertheless,
accumulating evidence indicates that IL-10 is involved in
the prostate cancer progression [60, 61], as well as breast
[62] and non-small cell lung cancers [63]. We have shown
that IL-10 significantly inhibit the growth, migration
and invasion, most probably by down regulating the cell
stemness in these two prostate cancer cell lines in vitro.
IL-24 is a member of the IL-10 family [41].
Increasing number of studies has pointed out the
possibility of IL-24 as a promising therapeutic target
for tumors. IL-24 inhibits the growth of breast [64] and

breast [67] and prostate [68] cancers. Recombinant human
IL-24 (rhIL-24) reverses the chemoresistance in human
breast cancer cell line MCF-7 cells [69] and significantly
suppresses the growth of ovarian cancer cell [70]. It is also
reported that IL-24 plays a critical antitumor role in oral
[71], rectal [72] and pancreatic cancers [73]. To our best
knowledge, this is the first report exploring the effect of
IL-24 on the stemness of prostate cancer cells in vitro.
In summary, we have discovered in our present
study that while ILs-3, 6 and 11 have similar tumor
promotion and stemness stimulation effects, IL-10 and
IL-24 reveal opposite effects on prostate cancer cells in
vitro, underlining a complex role of ILs in vivo, which
merit further studies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
Human PCa cell lines LNCaP and PC3 cells were
obtained from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (ATCC,
USA). All cells were cultivated in RPMI 1640 (Gibco/
Invitrogen, USA) medium supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone, USA), 1% penicillin/
streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and L-glutamine
(Sigma-Aldrich, USA) in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator
at 37°C.

Sulforhodamine B assay
Human PCa LNCaP and PC3 cells were plated at
6,000 per well in 96-well plates and incubated overnight
at 37°C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. On
the following day, IL-3, 6, 10 and 11(Invitrogen, USA)
and IL-24(R&D, USA) up to 100 ng/ml (0.01, 0.1, 1,
2,5,10, 50, 100 ng/ml) in complete medium were added to
different wells and cultivated for additional 48 hrs. Control
wells were added with complete medium. Cell viability
was determined using the Sulforhodamine B assay
(SRB) (Sigma, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, culture medium was aspirated
and the cells were fixed by addition of 100 μl cold
10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) at 4°C for 1 h, washed
five times with deionized water and left to dry at room
temperature. The cells were then stained with 100 μl SRB
dye 0.4% (w/v) dissolved in 1% acetic acid (v/v) for at
least 15 minutes, washed four times with 1% acetic acid to
remove unbound dye and left to dry at room temperature.
The dye bound protein was solubilized with 150 μl 10
mM unbuffered tris base and examined with Multi-Mode
Microplate Reader (Biotek Synergy2, USA) for optical
density reading at 560nm.

5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine assay
Cells were plated at 5 × 103 per well in 96-well
microtiter plates, treated with different cytokines and

incubated for 24 hrs. Then 100 μl 50 μM 5-ethynyl-2′deoxyuridine (EdU) (CellLight EdU DNA imaging
Kit, Guangzhou RiboBio, China) were added into each
well and the cells were cultured for an additional 2
hrs. The cells were stained with EdU according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. EdU medium was discarded
and 4% paraformaldehyde was added to fix the cells at
room temperature for 30 min. The cells were washed
with glycine (2 mg/ml) for 5 min in a shaker and treated
with 0.5% Trion X-100 for 10 min before washed with
PBS for five minutes. The cells were then incubated
with 1× Apollo® click stain reaction buffer for 30 min
while protecting from light, washed with 0.5% Triton
X-100 for three times to permeate the cells, stained with
Hoechst33342 (10ug/ml) for 30 min at room temperature,
washed with PBS for three times. The cells were examined
with an inverted florescence microscope(Olympus, Japan)
immediately.

invasion inhibition = [(OD values of the control group OD values of the transfection group)/ OD values of the
control group] × 100%.

Flow cytometry analysis

Cells were seeded into a 6-well plate and allowed to
grow to 60% confluent in complete medium. Cells were
then wounded by a sterile pipette tip (1 mm), washed with
PBS for several times to remove cell debris and incubated
for additional 18 h with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium
with or without corresponding interleukins. During the
incubation at 37°C, cells migrated into wound surface
which was considered as a process of in vitro healing. The
healing process was recorded by inverted fluorescence
microscopy. The rate of wound healing=[(the wound
width of 0 h- the wound width 18 h)/ the wound width
0 h wound width ] × 100%.

All cells were harvested at logarithmic growth phase
before analyzed by a flow cytometer (FCM, FACSCalibur,
BD, USA) within 1 h.
Apoptotic cells were detected using Annexin
V-FITC/PI kit(KeyGen Biotech, China) according
to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, after treated
with interleukin that combined with and without
docetaxel(10nmol/L), cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm
for 5 min at the concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. Then
the pellets were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in 500 μl binding
buffer before 10 μl Annexin V-FITC and 5 μl of PI were
added into each of the solution, and the cells were gently
vortexed and incubated for 15 min at room temperature in
the dark before flowcytometry.
For cell surface stem cell markers ABCG2 and
CD44, an anti-ABCG2 monoclonal antibody directly
conjugated with phycoerythrin(PE) and an anti-CD44
monoclonal antibody directly conjugated with APC,
purchased from BD Pharmingen Company, were applied
in this study. The antibodies were used at optimized
dilutions, and the cells were prepared with a similar
procedure as described above before flowcytometry.
PE Mouse IgG2b (eBioscience, USA) and APC Mouse
IgG2b (eBioscience, USA) isotype controls were used as
negative controls. Viable and single cells were gated for
each sample before examination

Transwell migration and invasion assay

FQ-RT-PCR

Transwell 24-well filters (Corning, USA) with
8.0 μM pores were used for the migration and invasion
assays, according to the protocols recommended by
the manufacturer. Briefly, for invasion assay, transwell
membranes were coated with 60 μL of matrigel (BD, USA)
at a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL and dried 1 × 105
cells in 100 μL with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. The
membranes were added to the upper chamber triplicate
wells and allowed to migrate through matrigel overnight
at 37°C with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. The lower
compartment of the transwell chamber was filled with 600
μL RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS. The migration assay was
performed with exactly the same procedure except that the
membranes were not coated with matrigel. After incubated
for 24 hrs(migration assay was 6 h), the cells on the upper
surface of filter were removed with a cotton swab, fixed
with 4% formaldehyde and stained with Giemsa solution.
The cells on the lower surface, which were the migrated/
invaded cells, were photographed under the high-power
microscopic field(HPF)(200 ×) . The rate of migration/

Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen, USA) by following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, after cells were treated with or
without IL-3, 6, 10, 11 and 24 at 48 hrs, the cells (1 × 106)
were harvested and washed twice with cold phosphatebuffered saline (PBS). For each well, 1.0 mL TRIzol
reagent was added, and then RNA was precipitated
by isopropanol, washed with 75% ethanol, dissolved
with 20 μL DEPC (0.1%), and quantified using a UV
spectrophotometer.
Reverse transcription was carried out with the
PrimeScript™RT reagent Kit (TaKaRa, Janpan) according
to the standard protocol. In brief, in a 20 μL reaction mixture
containing 2 μg RNA and oligo primers, at 42°C for 1 h,
and the synthesized cDNA was used for PCR by using
SYBR®Premix Ex Taq™II (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) with
the primers as shown in Table 1. PCR was performed as
follows: 30 sec of pre-degeneration at 95°C; 5 sec at 95°C
and 20 sec at 60°C for 40 cycles with Roche instrumentLightcycler 480 (Roche, USA). SOX2 gene and β-actin

allow for cells attachment. Different interleukins were then
added into the medium for culturing another two weeks.
The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
for 30 min, and stained with Giemsa for 30 min at room
temperature. The plates were gently washed with PBS and
evaluated under microscope. Cell cluster with more than
30 cells was considered as a colony. Colony formation
efficiency was estimated as follows: Colony formation
efficiency = colonies/input cells × 100%.

Western blotting
Cells ready for Western blotting analysis were
harvested and washed with cold PBS twice, then lysed on
ice in RIPA buffer (1 × PBS, 1% NP-40, 0.1% sodium
dodecylsulfate (SDS), 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% sodium
deoxycholate, and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate) that
contained 100 μg/mL phenylmethylsul-fonylsuoride and
protease inhibitors (KeyGen, Nanjing, China).
Approximately 50 μg of protein from each sample
was separated using a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel,
electrotransfered to polyvinylidene fluoride(PVDF)
membranes and blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in Trisbuffered saline, pH 7.5 (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris,
and 0.1% Tween-20). The transferred membranes were
incubated with anti-SOX2 (Cell Signaling Technology,
USA) and anti-β-actin primary antibodies (Beyotime,
Jiangsu, China) overnight at 4°C, followed by incubation
with
horseradish
peroxidase(HRP)
conjugated
IgG(JacksonImmunoResearch, USA). Proteins were
detected by Quantity-one software (Bio-Rad, Laboratories,
Inc, USA) using Immobilon ECL Chemiluminescence
HRP Substrate (Millipore, Merck, USA).

Statistical analysis
All data are expressed as mean ± the standard
deviation (SD) and subjected to one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA). Differences between groups were
examined by Student t test unless otherwise noted.
Statistical significance was accepted at the level of p-value
less than 0.05 by using SPSS 17.0 software.

Immunofluorescence microscopy
2 × 105 cells were plated on coverslips, which were
placed on the bottom in 6-well plates, and treated with
different cytokines. Before examination, the cells were
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS(pH 7.5) for 30
min and permeated with 0.5% Trion X-100 for 15 min
at room temperature. The coverslips were first immersed
for 1 h in blocking solution that contained 5% bovine
serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, and the cells were then
incubated for overnight at 4°C with rabbit antibodies
against SOX2 (CST, USA). DNA was counterstained
with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 5ug/ml) and
observed under inverted fluorescence microscope.
