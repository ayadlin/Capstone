ABSTRACT
Transforming acidic coiled-coil protein 3 (TACC3) is essential for cell mitosis and
transcriptional functions. In the present study, we first demonstrated that both TACC3
protein and mRNA levels were elevated in HCC tissue samples compared with noncancerous tissue biopsies according to western blot analyses, immunohistochemistry
(IHC) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays. Moreover, high TACC3
expression was positively correlated with poor overall survival (OS) and diseasefree survival (DFS) (p < 0.001). Using HCC cell lines, we then demonstrated that
either TACC3 knockdown or treatment with the potential TACC3 inhibitor KHS101
suppressed cell growth and sphere formation as well as the expression of stem cell
transcription factors, including Bmi1, c-Myc and Nanog. Silencing TACC3 may suppress
the Wnt/β-catenin and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, which regulate cancer stem
cell-like characteristics. Taken together, these data suggest that TACC3 is enriched
in HCC and that TACC3 down-regulation inhibits the proliferation, clonogenicity, and
cancer stem cell-like phenotype of HCC cells. KHS101, a TACC3 inhibitor, may serve
as a novel therapeutic agent for HCC patients with tumors characterized by high
TACC3 expression.

INTRODUCTION

Intermediate- to advanced-stage HCC tumors are highly
aggressive and either respond poorly to common therapies
or do not respond at all. Therefore, new therapeutic
strategies that are effective and well-tolerated are urgently
required.
Targeted therapy, a newly emerging research area,
has significantly changed the traditional treatment of
cancer, including HCC, over the past 15 years [6-9].
Sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor of the VEGF

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the ﬁfth most
frequently diagnosed cancer and the third most common
cause of cancer-related mortality in the world; therefore,
HCC is a serious global health problem [1]. The incidence
of HCC has been increasing in recent decades [2]. Despite
improvements in HCC diagnosis and treatments, only 30%
to 40% of HCC patients undergo curative therapy [3-5].

and PDGF receptors, has been confirmed in clinical
trials to be effective and safe in patients with advanced
HCC [2, 8, 10, 11]. Although all of these clinical trials
were adjusted for advanced-stage tumors, the results
were still not promising. Tumor cell stemness has been
frequently investigated as an emerging new area of focus.
A large number of studies have indicated that cancer
stem cells (CSCs), which are present in the original
tumor, have the capacity to self-renew and give rise to a
variety of differentiated cells [12]. CSCs play key roles
in tumorigenesis, recurrence and metastasis. Therefore,
inhibiting CSC functions will reduce tumor proliferation
and likely cure malignant tumors. Signaling pathways such
as the Wnt, Notch, Shh and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways
play important roles in the regulation of HCC stem cells
[13-16]. Thus, identifying factors that block one or more
of these signaling pathways might lead to the inhibition of
cancer stem-like capabilities.
Transforming acidic coiled-coil protein (TACC)
family members are characterized by a highly conserved
C-terminal coiled-coil domain and comprise centrosomeand microtubule-associated proteins. To date, TACCs have
been considered adapters that interact with the spindle and
centrosome apparatus to promote centrosome integrity,
microtubule assembly and spindle stability during mitosis
[17-21]. In addition to their function in mitosis, TACCs
are involved in controlling cell growth, differentiation and
transcriptional regulation [19, 20, 22-24]. As a member
of the TACC family, TACC3, located on chromosome
4p16.3, also stabilizes and organizes the mitotic spindle
to allow for proper chromosomal segregation [25, 26].
Phosphorylation of the TACC3-chTOG complex on
Ser-558 by Aurora and integrin-linked kinase (ILK)
is the key mechanism involved in maintaining spindle
microtubule growth and stability [18, 27-33]. Clathrin
heavy chain (CHC) serves as an adaptor protein to recruit
phosphorylated TACC3 to the spindle during mitosis [34].
Angelica et al recently discovered an FGFR-TACC fusion
protein in a small subset of glioblastoma multiforme
(GBM) tumors. The fusion protein, which localizes to
mitotic spindle poles, has constitutive kinase activity,
induces mitotic and chromosomal segregation defects
and triggers aneuploidy [35]. The fusion gene, which has
been defined as an oncogene, has also been identified in
nasopharyngeal carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma and
bladder cancer [36-38]. TACC3 may also interact with the
signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5),
aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT)
and Friend of GATA-1 (FOG-1) [24, 39, 40], suggesting
a potential role in the regulation of gene transcription.
TACC3 inhibits Notch signaling by interacting with
Notch4/Int3 [22]. TACC3 also promotes ERK and PI3K/
AKT signaling, which induces the epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT), leading to cervical cancer initiation [41].
Considerable evidence exists supporting the involvement
of TACC3 dysregulation in tumorigenesis. However,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

TACC3 expression varies in different cancers. For
example, TACC3 expression is increased in GBM, nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and breast cancer but
decreased in ovarian and thyroid cancers [31, 42-45]. To
date, the role of TACC3 in HCC has remained elusive.
In the present study, we first assessed TACC3 expression
in HCC and then elucidated the molecular mechanisms
underlying the TACC3-mediated regulation of CSC-like
characteristics. Taken together, these data suggest that
TACC3 might be a new therapeutic target for HCC.

RESULTS
TACC3 expression was increased in HCC cells
and tumor tissues
To investigate TACC3 expression in HCC, TACC3
mRNA and protein levels were analyzed by qRT-PCR
assays and western blot analysis in the immortalized
liver cell line LO2 and in a panel of HCC cell lines (SKHep-1, SMMC-7721, Bel-7402, MHCC-97L, QGY7703, and Huh7). TACC3 expression was clearly higher
in the HCC cell lines than in the immortalized liver cell
line LO2 (Figure 3A, 3B). We further examined TACC3
expression in HCC patients. TACC3 protein expression
(92.2%, 12/13) was increased in the HCC tumor tissues
compared with the non-cancerous samples (Figure 1A).
TACC3 mRNA levels (95.2%, 21/23) were also elevated
in the tumor tissues compared with the counterpart noncancerous tissues (Figure 1B). To further examine TACC3
expression in fresh HCC tissues in situ, IHC staining
was employed. As shown in Figure 1C, TACC3 protein
was expressed predominantly in the plasma membrane
of HCC cells in the tumor regions (T), whereas TACC3
was only occasionally expressed in the liver cells of the
adjacent non-cancerous tissue (N). Taken together, these
data demonstrated that TACC3 expression was increased
in HCC tumor tissues.

High TACC3 levels were correlated with a poor
prognosis in HCC patients
To identify the relationship between TACC3
expression and clinicopathological variables, 237 HCC
specimens were subjected to IHC staining (Figure 1C).
High TACC3 expression was correlated with poorly
differentiated HCC tissues (Table 1). The median followup period of the entire studied cohort was 49 months, and
the median OS was 40 months. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year
OS rates were 76.8%, 64.1%, and 59.5%, respectively.
According to the ROC curve analysis, the TACC3
expression cut-off value was 0.4 (Figure 2A); a score
exceeding 0.4 was defined as high expression. Of the 237
HCC tumors, 74 (31.2%) had high TACC3 expression.

TACC3 knockdown suppresses the proliferation
and clonogenicity of HCC cells

Tumor size showed the most significant correlation with
TACC3 expression (Table 1, p < 0.001).
According to the Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients
with higher TACC3 expression suffered from decreased
OS and DFS (p < 0.001, Figure 2B, 2C). Stratification
analysis based on the TNM staging revealed that higher
TACC3 levels suggested a poorer prognosis in earlyintermediate stages (Figure 2D, 2E). No correlation was
found between TACC3 expression and stage IV HCC
(Supplementary Figure 2). According to the multivariate
analysis, TACC3 expression (HR = 2.267, P < 0.001),
tumor size (HR = 2.358, p = 0.003), microvascular
invasion (HR = 2.527, p < 0.001), and TNM staging (HR =
1.272, P = 0.035) were independent predictors of survival.

To explore the potential role of TACC3 in HCC
tumorigenesis, TACC3 expression was knocked down
in SMMC-7721, SK-Hep-1, Bel-7402 and Huh-7 cells
with two distinct siRNA duplexes. Western blotting was
used to validate the knockdown efficiency. As depicted
in Figure 3C, TACC3 expression was nearly abolished
in the siTACC3 transfectants. Viability was assessed
at the indicated times with an MTT assay. Compared
with the control, the siTACC3 transfectants displayed
significantly decreased proliferation (Figure 3C and
Supplementary Figure 1). A clonogenicity assay was then
performed to evaluate the effect of TACC3 knockdown
on the clonogenicity of the HCC cells. Both the size and
number of siTACC3 transfectants were dramatically
decreased compared with the SiNC cells (Figure 3D and
Supplementary Figure 1).

Western blot and qRT-PCR assays were used to assess
whether TACC3 down-regulation was associated with
changes in stem cell transcription factors (SCTFs). Bmi1,
c-Myc and Nanog were decreased concurrently with
TACC3 down-regulation (Figure 4B, 4C). SOX2 was
undetectable by both qRT-PCR and western blotting.

To investigate the effect of TACC3 on stem celllike capabilities, a sphere formation assay was performed.

AKT signaling pathways. We therefore examined whether
TACC3 participated in Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation
in the HCC cell lines. Compared with the negative control,
TACC3 down-regulation led to decreased GSK3β (Ser-9)
phosphorylation and β-catenin down-regulation, whereas
total GSK3β-levels remained unchanged (Figures 4C
and 5). β-catenin/TCF activation leads to the increased

expression of downstream target genes such as c-Myc and
cyclin D1 [47-50]. Accordingly, TACC3 knockdown led
to decreased c-Myc and cyclin D1 expression (Figures
4C and 5). These data suggested that the knockdown of
TACC3 suppressed the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway,
possibly contributing to the inhibition of stem cell
processes. Accumulating evidence indicates that GSK3β is

The TACC3 protein inhibitor KHS101 suppressed
cell proliferation and the stem-like phenotype in
vitro

a downstream target of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway
[51]. Therefore, we examined whether TACC3 downregulation inhibited AKT activity. As shown in Figure 5,
TACC3 down-regulation reduced AKT phosphorylation
at Ser-308, whereas total AKT levels remained stable.
These results indicated that TACC3 down-regulation
reduced AKT activation. Together, these data suggested
that TACC3 down-regulation reduced stem cell-like traits
at least in part through inhibition of the PI3K/AKT and
Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways (Figure 5).

KHS101, a small molecule known for its role in
neuronal differentiation, binds to the TACC3 protein.
Likely through a functional link between KHS101 and
the TACC3-ARNT2 axis, KHS101-mediated interference
with TACC3 accelerates neurogenesis and concomitantly
suppresses proliferation. However, whether KHS101
suppresses liver CSC-like characteristics is unknown.

different KHS101 concentrations (40 µM and 20 µM,
respectively, Figure 6A) to determine the IC50 values. The
IC12.5 and IC25 concentrations were then used to test the
interference in HCC cell lines. After KHS101 treatment,
SMCC-7721 and SK-Hep-1 cells were cultured in specific
F12 sphere-forming medium for 1 week. The number and
size of spheres were significantly decreased after treatment
with KHS101 compared with the control (DMSO)
treatment (Figure 6B). As illustrated in Figure 6B, sphere
formation was dependent on the KHS101 concentration.
qRT-PCR and western blot assays were used to assess
whether KHS101 was associated with changes in SCTFs.
Bmi1, c-Myc, and Nanog were all decreased in the
presence of KHS101 (Figure 6D). Western blot analysis
was performed to investigate the mechanism by which
KHS101 inhibits sphere formation. Compared with the
control (DMSO), KHS101 decreases the expression of
p-AKT, p-GSK3β and β-catenin, as well as the expression
of the downstream markers c-Myc and cyclin D1 (Figure
6E). Thus, TACC3 may mediate the development of liver
CSC-like characteristics through the PI3K/AKT and Wnt/
β-catenin signaling pathways.

correlated to the stage of carcinoma. Additionally, high
TACC3 expression was positively correlated with poor
differentiation, microvascular invasion, and, in particular,
tumor size. Taken together, our data revealed that TACC3
might serve as an oncogene in HCC. High TACC3 levels
predicted a poor prognosis, highlighting the potential use
of a TACC3 inhibitor as an HCC therapy.
An interesting phenomenon was observed in the
IHC analysis. The distribution of TACC3 expression
was sporadic; this protein accumulated at the border of
neoplastic cell nests and was sometimes present in normal
tissues. TACC3 expression might correlate with the
EMT, as suggested by Geun [41]. In addition to the EMT,
TACC3 may also affect tumor stem cell-like capabilities.
Based on this hypothesis, a sphere formation assay and
related experiments were performed. TACC3 downregulation prominently suppressed CSC phenotypes
and critical SCTFs such as Bmi1, c-Myc, and Nanog.
The polycomb-group (PcG) gene Bmi1 plays a critical
role in the self-renewal of a range of somatic stem cells,
including hepatic stem cells [53, 54]. The transcription
factor Nanog is essential for ESC self-renewal, protein
expression, differentiation and tumorigenesis [55, 56].
Nanog also predicts prognosis and regulates human tumor
development [57, 58]. c-Myc is a key factor for stem cell
self-renewal and differentiation during tumor development
and oncogenic processes; additionally, c-myc regulates
cell cycle progression and apoptosis [59, 60]. Notably,
the PTEN/PI3K pathway can directly repress c-Myc.
Specifically, p53 represses c-Myc transcription by directly
binding the c-Myc promoter [61], whereas the downstream
PI3K pathway components inhibit c-Myc translation and
promote protein degradation [62, 63]. In the present study,
both western blot and qRT-PCR assays demonstrated that
TACC3 knockdown suppressed stem cell-like markers,
indicating that TACC3 may be involved in certain
signaling pathways that promote stem cell-like traits.
c-Myc and cyclin D1 are two key downstream
targets of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. The expression
of these two markers decreased in conjunction with
decreased TACC3 expression, indicating that the Wnt/
β-catenin signaling pathway might be the molecular
mechanism by which TACC3 promotes stem cell traits.
Wnt/β-catenin signaling is a crucial stem cell regulator and
plays various important roles in many cancers. Aberrant
Wnt/β-catenin signaling leads to a wide range of human
pathologies. When the receptors of the Frizzled and LRP
families (Lrp5/6) are bound to ligands on the cell surface,
the signal is transduced to β-catenin, which is the central
player located in cytoplasm. Mutant forms of β-catenin are
associated with many cancers, including HCC. β-catenin
stability is regulated by the destruction complex, which
includes the tumor suppressors adenomatous polyposis
coli (APC) and axin. If the receptor is not bound to Wnt,
then CKI and GSK3, two kinases residing in the complex,
phosphorylate a set of conserved Ser and Thr residues

DISCUSSION
The clinical complexity, genetic diversity and
molecular heterogeneity of HCC make this cancer a
worldwide health problem and hamper the progress of
therapeutic development. This study explored increased
TACC3 expression in HCC and the dynamic interplay
between stem cell-like characteristics and signaling
pathways to assess whether TACC3 is a novel target for
HCC therapy.
As discussed above, TACC3 levels in various
cancers are controversial and are correlated with
the type of cell, organ or carcinoma [52], and the
molecular mechanisms of TACC3 remain elusive. In the
present study, we determined that TACC3 might be an
oncogene that plays an important role in tumorigenesis,
differentiation, amplification and metastasis in HCC.
Based on our data, TACC3 expression was increased, as
measured by both western blotting and qRT-PCR assays.
As assessed by IHC staining, TACC3 expression in HCC
specimens was clearly higher than that in non-cancerous
tissue (Figure 1C). Furthermore, according to univariate
and multivariate analyses, TACC3 was an independent
predictor of prognosis because higher TACC3 expression
corresponded with a poorer OS and DFS. The subgroup
analysis based on TNM staging revealed that TACC3
only accurately predicted the prognosis in early- to
intermediate-stage tumors. There are three likely reasons
for this phenomenon: (1) stage IV patients accounted for
only a small proportion of the total patient population
(17/237), which might skew the results; (2) stage IV
tumors usually occur with hepatic dysfunction, which may
affect the prognosis; and (3) TACC3 levels were absolutely

at the amino terminus of β-catenin, thereby recruiting a
b-TrCP-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, which targets
β-catenin for proteasomal degradation. If the receptor
binds Wnt, GSK3 is phosphorylated, leading to β-catenin
accumulation. Activated β-catenin travels into the nucleus,
where it activates the N termini of Tcf/Lef family DNAbinding proteins. The c-myc gene has been identified as a
direct target of LEF-1/TCF proteins, which are repressed
by wild-type APC and activated by β-catenin in colon
cancer cells [48]. Cyclin D1, which is regulated by
β-catenin, contributes to tumor progression. In this study,
knocking down TACC3 increased p-GSK3β levels, which
then suppressed β-catenin activation, leading to reduced
c-Myc and cyclin D1 levels. Finally, stem cell-like
capabilities were decreased. β-catenin activation by the
PI3K/AKT pathway has also been reported in HepG2 and
HeLa cells. We obtained consistent results by verifying the
expression of AKT. Taken together, these results indicate
that TACC3 can affect stem cell-like traits, partially by
affecting the Wnt/β-catenin and PI3K/AKT signaling
pathways.
The small molecule KHS101 was recently found
to bind to the TACC3 protein. By interacting with the
TACC3-ARNT2 axis, KHS101 inhibited cell cycle
progression in a similar manner as TACC3 siRNA.
However, the molecular mechanisms downstream of
TACC3 have not been determined. In this study, KHS101
significantly suppressed the proliferation and stem celllike traits, as well as the expression of stem cell markers,
of both SMMC-7721 and SK-Hep-1 cells via the Wnt/βcatenin and PI3K/AKT pathways. Notably, TACC3
expression was slightly increased. Mechanistically,
KHS101 likely binds to TACC3 in the cytoplasm to
increase TACC3 protein synthesis. Taken together, these
results indicate that TACC3 might be a molecular target
for clinical HCC therapy.
In summary, we investigated the expression and
potential role, as well as the underlying molecular
mechanisms, of TACC3 in HCC. Our data revealed
that TACC3 up-regulation was correlated with a poor
prognosis and highlighted the potential use of a TACC3
inhibitor in clinical HCC therapy.

The HCC cell lines (LO2, SK-Hep-1, SMMC7721, Bel-7402, MHCC-97L, QGY-7703, and Huh7)
were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM; Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco) in a humidified 5%
CO2 incubator at 37°C.

Quantitative RT-PCR analysis
RNA was extracted from fresh tissue specimens and
HCC cell lines using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Grand
Island, NY, USA). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was
synthesized using a reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen).
Primers for the quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assays are
presented in Supplementary Table 1. Three independent
experiments were performed to verify the quantitation of
the data.

Western blot analysis
Western blotting was performed as previously
described [46]. The primary and conjugated secondary
antibodies used are listed in Supplementary Table 2.

Immunohistochemical analysis
The paraffin-embedded HCC samples were cut into
4-µm-thick sections. Immunohistochemical staining was
performed as previously described [46]. Briefly, after
deparaffinizing and rehydrating the sections and blocking
endogenous peroxidase activity, the sections were boiled
in a citrate antigen retrieval solution (pH = 6.0) for 2
min in an electric pressure cooker for antigen retrieval.
The sections were then incubated overnight with a rabbit
polyclonal anti-TACC3 antibody (diluted 1:800, Abcam,
USA) at 4ºC, followed by incubation with a secondary
antibody for 30 min at 37ºC. Finally, the sections were
dehydrated and mounted.
Each section was evaluated with an automated
image analyzer by a pathologist who was blinded to
the clinical status of the patients. TACC3 expression
was evaluated according to the intensity and extent of
staining. The staining intensity was scored using the
following system: 0, negative staining; 1, weak staining;
2, moderate staining; and 3, strong staining. The extent
of staining was scored as the percentage of positive cells.
A final immunoreactivity score (IRS) was given for each
sample, defined as the intensity score multiplied by the
extent score.

Statistical analysis

siRNA oligo-ribonucleotides were purchased
from RiboBio (RiboBio, Guangzhou, China); detailed
information is presented in Supplementary Table 3. The
negative control (NC) RNA duplex for the siRNA was not
homologous to any human genome sequences. SMMC7721 and SK-Hep-1 cells (2×105) were seeded into 6-well

A two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test was used
to analyze the differences between groups. Receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used
to identify the cut-off value for TACC3. A chi-squared
test was used to analyze the relationship between TACC3
expression and clinicopathological characteristics. The
Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the OS and
DFS and to conduct sub-analyses according to the TNM
staging, and comparisons were performed using the logrank test. The prognostic variables used in predicting
the OS were assessed by multivariate Cox proportional
hazards regression analysis. Variables that were significant
in the univariate analysis were subsequently tested with
the multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. All of
the statistical tests were two-sided, and differences with
p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All of the
statistical tests were performed using SPSS 19.0 statistical
software (SPSS Company, Chicago, Illinois, USA).

MTT assay
An
MTT
[3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium] assay was used to measure cell
viability. After transfection with siNC, siTACC3-1#, or
siTACC3-2# for 48 h, SMMC-7721 and SK-Hep-1 cells
(3,000 cells/well) were plated in sextuplicate in a 96-well
plate and cultured with DMEM containing 10% FBS. At
the indicated time points, 20 μL of 5 mg/mL MTT was
added to each well, and the cells were incubated for 4 h at
37°C. Then, 150 μL of 100% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)
was used to dissolve the precipitates. The absorbance was
measured at 490 nm with a SpectraMax M5 (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, USA) plate reader.
