BACKGROUND: Several phase II trials in men with noncastrate PSA-recurrent prostate cancer have assessed
the impact of novel nonhormonal agents on PSA kinetics. However, it is unknown whether changes in PSA kinetics
influence metastasis-free survival (MFS). METHODS: We performed a retrospective post hoc analysis of 146
men treated in 4 phase II trials examining the investigational agents marimastat (a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor;
n ¼ 39), imatinib (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor; n ¼ 25), ATN-224 (a copper/zinc-superoxide dismutase inhibitor;
n ¼ 22), and lenalidomide (an antiangiogenic/immunomodulatory drug; n ¼ 60). We investigated factors influencing
MFS, including within-subject changes in PSA kinetics (PSA slope, doubling time, and velocity) before and after treatment initiation. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 16.8 months, 70 patients (47.9%) developed metastases. In multivariable Cox regression models, factors that were independently predictive of MFS after adjusting for age and other
clinical prognostic variables were baseline PSA doubling time (PSADT) (P ¼ .05), baseline PSA slope (P ¼ .01), on-study
change in PSADT (P ¼ .02), and on-study change in PSA slope (P ¼ .03). In a landmark Kaplan-Meier analysis, median
MFS was 63.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 34.6-not reached) and 28.9 months (95% CI, 13.5-68.0) for men
with or without any decrease in PSA slope by 6 months after treatment, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This hypothesisgenerating analysis suggests that within-subject changes in PSADT and PSA slope after initiation of experimental
therapy may correlate with MFS in men with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer. If validated in prospective trials,
changes in PSA kinetics may represent a reasonable intermediate end point for screening new agents in these

INTRODUCTION
In men with nonmetastatic prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-recurrent prostate cancer after definitive local therapy, there
is currently no consensus on optimal management.1,2 Treatment options include observation,3,4 continuous androgen
deprivation therapy (ADT) initiated upon PSA recurrence,5,6 deferred ADT administered after the development of metastases or upon symptomatic progression,7,8 intermittent ADT,9,10 or enrollment in clinical trials.11 In addition, a subset of
patients with PSA recurrence may benefit from salvage pelvic irradiation.12 In practice, early ADT is often employed in

this patient population but this approach is associated
with long-term cardiovascular and metabolic risks.13-15
Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis has shown that compared with deferred ADT, early ADT decreases prostate
cancer-specific mortality but increases nonprostate cancer-specific mortality, and has no significant effect on
overall survival.8 However, because no prospective
randomized trial has specifically been conducted in men
with nonmetastatic PSA-recurrent disease to evaluate hormonal therapy initiated immediately or at the time of
metastatic progression, there is still significant controversy
surrounding the optimal timing of androgen suppression
in these patients.16
In recent years, interest has emerged in identifying
hormone-sparing therapies for the initial management of
men with PSA-recurrent disease without detectable metastases. To date, a large number of biological and immunological agents have been evaluated in phase II clinical
trials in these patients.17-25 However, progress in this area
has been hampered by the use of suboptimal study endpoints, the absence of placebo-controlled trials, and the
short duration of follow-up. Because of the inability to
follow radiographic or clinical parameters in this setting,
the majority of such studies have utilized changes in PSA
kinetics (PSA doubling time, PSA slope, and PSA velocity) as their primary endpoint. Importantly, it is not
known whether such PSA alterations are related to clinically meaningful outcomes such as metastasis-free survival
(MFS) and overall survival.
We have previously conducted 4 phase II trials
investigating experimental nonhormonal agents in men
with nonmetastatic PSA-recurrent prostate cancer after
local therapy.19-22 All of these studies examined changes
in PSA kinetics before and after study drug initiation as
their primary endpoint, and none specifically evaluated
MFS. The present study is a combined retrospective analysis of these 4 trials (n ¼ 146), aiming to investigate the
potential relationship between intrasubject changes in
PSA kinetics and MFS. We hypothesized that improvements in PSA kinetics after initiation of such nonhormonal treatments would correlate with prolonged MFS in
these patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
The designs of the 4 phase II studies included in this combined analysis have been described in detail previously.19-22
The first study19 was a randomized phase I/II trial evaluating

1534

3 doses of an oral matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor,
marimastat (5 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg daily). A total of
39 patients were enrolled, and the primary efficacy endpoint
was change in median PSA slope after 6 months of the study
drug. The second trial20 was a single-arm phase II study of
the oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib (800 mg daily). A
total of 25 men participated, and the primary endpoint was
PSA response rate defined as a 50% decrease in PSA from
baseline. The third study21 was a randomized phase II trial
of 2 doses of an oral copper/zinc-superoxide dismutase
inhibitor, ATN-224 (30 mg or 300 mg daily). A total of
47 patients were accrued, and the primary endpoint was
change in mean PSA slope and mean PSA doubling time on
study. The 4th trial22 was a randomized phase I/II study
evaluating the oral antiangiogenic and immunomodulatory
drug, lenalidomide (5 mg or 25 mg daily). A total of 60 men
were enrolled, and the primary endpoint was change in
median PSA slope after 6 months. None of these trials
were designed a priori to capture data on MFS or overall
survival.
All 4 studies were conducted at the Johns Hopkins
Kimmel Cancer Center, Baltimore, Maryland. Three trials were single-center experiences, whereas the ATN-224
study was performed through the Department of
Defense/Prostate Cancer Foundation-sponsored consortium that also included 5 other centers. In all studies, eligible patients were required to have PSA-recurrent
prostate cancer after local therapy (prostatectomy or
radiotherapy), noncastrate levels of serum testosterone,
nonmetastatic disease as determined by computed tomography (CT) and/or bone scan, and rising PSA levels. All
trials used experimental agents that were not expected to
mediate their effects through the endocrine axis. While on
study, patients were required to have PSA assessments
either every month (marimastat, ATN-224) or every
2 months (imatinib, lenalidomide). Patients were treated
with study drug for either 6 months (marimastat, ATN224, lenalidomide) or 12 months (imatinib), or less if
unmanageable drug-related toxicities developed. In all trials, patients came off study upon PSA progression, clinical
progression, metastatic progression, or death (whichever
occurred first).
Study Design
The present study was a post hoc analysis of MFS using
combined data from the 4 phase II studies outlined above.
We retrospectively examined patient charts and/or electronic medical records for information on first metastatic
occurrence and death. Metastatic disease was defined as

the presence of osseous metastases visualized on bone scan
(or magnetic resonance image [MRI] scan); and/or visceral (liver, lung, brain) or extra-pelvic nodal metastases
visualized on CT scan. In the 4 studies, radiographic
evaluations were performed either every 3 months (ATN224) or every 6 months (marimastat, imatinib, lenalidomide), or sooner if clinically indicated. After trial completion, imaging studies were ordered at the discretion of the
treating physicians (and scanning intervals ranged from
2 to 12 months). Radiologists were blinded to PSA results.
Metastasis-free survival was defined as the time interval
from study entry until initial metastasis or death. Patients
were captured at the time of their first positive scan or
censored at the time of their last confirmed negative scan.
The data cut-off date was set as March 1, 2010. This study
was approved by the Johns Hopkins University institutional review board.
We used all available PSA values in the 12 months
preceding study enrollment to calculate the baseline PSA
kinetics parameters, and all available PSAs in the first
6 months after treatment initiation to calculate the
on-study PSA kinetics. PSA slope was defined as the linear
regression line of the natural log of PSA (in ng/mL)
against time (in months).26 PSA doubling time (PSADT)
was defined as the natural log of 2 divided by the slope of
the linear regression line of the natural log of PSA against
time (in months).26 PSA velocity was defined as the linear
regression line of PSA (in the natural scale) against time
(in months).27 Within-subject changes in PSA kinetics
parameters before and after study enrollment were
determined by comparing baseline values to on-study
values. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between intrasubject changes in PSA kinetics and
MFS, after adjusting for other clinical factors known to
influence MFS.
The number of pretreatment or on-study PSA values
measured on any given patient ranged from a minimum
of 3 to a maximum of 7. When calculating the (loge) PSA
slope with a linear regression of the natural log of PSA
against time, our assumption was that the PSA values on a
logarithmic scale over time approximated a straight line,
that the variance of residuals calculated from these
regressions was constant over time, and that residuals were
normally distributed. Given the small number of PSA values (3-7) per regression, assumptions of homoscedasticity
and normality of the residuals from these regressions
could not be evaluated for each individual patient. However, although not an assumption of the linear regressions,
a test of normality of the distribution of the log of the

PSA values was not significant (Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test, P ¼ .14).
Statistical Analysis
The primary objective of this study was to determine the
independent contribution of changes in PSA kinetics on
MFS. Time to metastasis was calculated from study entry
to the date of metastasis or death. Event time distributions
for this endpoint were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier
method28 and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley.29 Landmark stratified Cox proportional hazards regressions were
used to assess the effects of PSA kinetics on MFS. Models
were stratified by study, and the landmark time was set at
6 months. This time point was chosen because all PSA
values during the first 6 months after study entry were
used to calculate on-study PSA kinetics. Such a landmark
analysis prevents metastatic events that might occur
during the first 6 months on study to be included in the
analysis.
In the univariate analysis, factors that entered the
model included age at study initiation (continuous variable), Gleason score (<7 vs 7), tumor stage at diagnosis
(T1/2 vs T3/4), lymph node involvement at diagnosis
(N0 vs N1), use of ADT after PSA recurrence but before
metastasis (yes vs no), baseline PSADT (>6 mo vs <6
mo), baseline PSA velocity (below median vs above
median), baseline PSA slope (below median vs above median), change in PSADT before and after study initiation
(increase in PSADT vs no increase), change in PSA velocity (decrease in velocity vs no decrease), and change in
PSA slope (decrease in slope vs no decrease). In the multivariable analysis, only those variables with P values from
the univariate model of .10 were included. Notably,
because all 3 PSA kinetic measures are a function
of changes in PSA against time and are all strongly
interrelated, 3 separate multivariable models each evaluating 1 kinetic measure at a time were created.
To account for the fact that on-study determinations
of PSA kinetics are dependent upon the time point at
which they are calculated, time-dependent covariate analyses of the relationship between log PSA or changes in log
PSA and MFS were also conducted. This was performed
using 3, 4, and 6 months of PSA data, respectively.
All P values reported are 2-sided, and the significance level was set at .05 for all analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute
Inc, Cary, NC) and R version 2.1 (National Cancer
Institute, Bethesda, MD).

developed metastases. The median MFS in the whole cohort
was 38.1 months (95% CI, 22.9-61.7 months).
Overall (n ¼ 146), median age at study entry was 63

PSA at baseline was 7.1 ng/mL; median PSA doubling
time at baseline was 5.0 months; median PSA slope at
baseline was 0.14; and median PSA velocity at baseline
was 0.7 ng/mL/month.
Correlation of Changes in PSA Kinetics with
MFS
In time-dependent covariate analysis, there was a statistically significant relationship between (log) PSA as well as
changes in (log) PSA and MFS, using 3 months, 4
months, and 6 months of on-study PSA data (Table 2).
In univariate proportional hazards regression analyses (stratified by study), significant associations with MFS
were observed for age, Gleason score, use of ADT before
metastasis, baseline PSADT, baseline PSA velocity, baseline (log) PSA slope, change in PSADT, change in PSA
velocity, and change in (log) PSA slope (Table 3). In these
analyses, changes in the 3 measures of PSA kinetics were
treated as dichotomous variables in an effort to facilitate
clinical interpretation of the results. However, when
treated as continuous variables, changes in the PSA
kinetics parameters retained their association with MFS

95% CI, 0.75-0.92, P ¼ .01; change in PSA slope: HR,
0.99; 95% CI, 0.98-1.00, P ¼ .06).
Figure 1 demonstrates the effect of changes in PSADT
(increase in PSADT after study entry vs no increase),
changes in PSA velocity (decrease in PSA velocity vs no
decrease), and changes in (log) PSA slope (decrease in PSA
slope vs no decrease) on MFS using Kaplan-Meier analysis.
In landmark multivariable analyses (Table 4),
change in PSADT and change in (log) PSA slope emerged
as significant independent predictors of MFS, whereas
change in PSA velocity did not retain statistical significance. Our multivariable models were stratified by study
to avoid assuming proportional hazards across the 4 different protocols. To test the discriminatory ability of the
multivariable models, we calculated the concordance
index (c) for Cox regressions. The c-statistics for the multivariable models using PSADT, velocity, and slope were
0.76, 0.76, and 0.78, respectively. These are within
the range of acceptable discrimination (0.7  c-statistic
<0.8). The univariate kinetics models in Table 3 and the
multivariable models in Table 4 were tested for proportional hazards by including time-by-covariate interaction
terms in the models. To this end, none of these terms
were significant (if a term had been significant, we would
have adjusted the model by retaining the interaction
term). In addition, plots of Schoenfeld residuals (with restricted cubic splines showing the smoothed relationship
of the residuals with time) for each predictor in all models
did not show any consistent trends with time. Global correlation with time tests of these Schoenfeld residuals for
each multivariable model in Table 4 was not significant.
This suggested that the proportional hazards assumption
was satisfied by our data.
Figure 2A considers on-study changes in (log) PSA
slope as falling into 1 of 3 distinct clinical subgroups:
those cases in which PSA slope decreases and becomes
negative after study drug initiation (ie, absolute PSA levels

DISCUSSION
In men with noncastrate biochemically recurrent prostate
cancer after local therapy, the use of changes in PSA
kinetics as an intermediate endpoint for evaluating the efficacy of nonhormonal experimental agents is attractive
but unfounded. Exploring a potential association between
changes in PSA kinetic measures and clinical outcomes
would be important, as these PSA kinetics changes could
serve as intermediate endpoints in therapeutic trials of
such agents. This could offer the potential to derive

reasonable conclusions about treatment efficacy while
shortening the duration of follow-up required, overcoming a significant obstacle in testing novel nonhormonal
agents in this patient population.
To our knowledge, this study is the first to document a correlation between changes in PSA kinetics and
MFS. Specifically, we have demonstrated that men whose
PSADT increased after study entry (compared with prestudy PSADT) or whose PSA slope decreased (compared
with prestudy PSA slope) had improved MFS. Importantly, the ability of changes in PSADT and PSA slope to
predict MFS persisted after accounting for relevant clinical factors (eg, age, Gleason score, and use of hormonal
therapy before metastasis) as well as pretreatment PSADT
and PSA slope. Therefore, in addition to baseline PSA kinetic factors derived at study entry, posttreatment changes
in these PSA kinetic measures were independently predictive of MFS.
For ease of clinical interpretation and applicability,
we subdivided PSA kinetics changes into 2 clinical subgroups for use in the univariate and multivariable models.
Interestingly, when patients were partitioned into 3 categories of PSA slope change, discreet MFS curves emerged
in Kaplan-Meier analysis. To this end, MFS was longest
for men whose PSA slopes decreased and became negative
after study drug initiation, whereas MFS was shortest for
men whose PSA slopes failed to decrease after study entry.
The results of this analysis can be compared with
those of 2 related studies evaluating the correlation
between PSA parameters and overall survival. In the first
study involving patients with metastatic noncastrate prostate cancer receiving ADT, a PSA of 4 ng/mL after
7 months of ADT was a strong predictor of survival.30 In
that same study, PSA progression (according to the Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 [PCWG2] definition31
within 7 months of ADT initiation also predicted for inferior survival.32 In the second study involving patients with
castration-resistant prostate cancer receiving chemotherapy, a PSA decline of 30% was predictive of overall survival.33 In that same study, PSA progression (using the
PCWG2 definition31) within 3 months of beginning
chemotherapy also portended a worse survival.32
Although the present study was unable to evaluate overall
survival due to an insufficient number of observed deaths
at last follow-up, it adds to the body of literature suggesting that PSA parameters may correlate with meaningful
clinical outcomes in men with prostate cancer.
This study has several limitations. First, this was a
retrospective study and none of the 4 trials included in the

combined analysis were designed to capture data on metastasis. In addition, because the majority of metastatic
events occurred after patients had been taken off study,
the frequency of subsequent bone scan and CT scan evaluations was dependent upon investigator practices and was
not regulated. Second, there was no control over additional therapies (including hormonal therapy) administered to patients after they came off study in each of the 4

trials. Therefore, it was essential to adjust for the use of
hormone therapy before metastasis in the multivariable
models. Third, a minority of patients (14.6%) were
excluded from analysis because of lack of available metastasis data. This may have introduced bias, although these
patients did not differ statistically from those who did
have available metastasis information with respect to any
of the clinical variables. Fourth, the causal relationship

this case) occur before the landmark time. In addition, it
is generally difficult to determine whether the variable of
interest (ie, change in PSA kinetics, in this case) actually
influences survival or if it simply acts as a marker of a
more favorable prognosis.
In addition, because the studies included in this
analysis used agents that are not particularly effective at
altering PSA (with the exception of lenalidomide), this
may have diminished our ability to detect a stronger association between PSA kinetics changes and MFS. Furthermore, the use of marginal drugs may potentially render
the results of this analysis uninterpretable, because there is
no direct evidence that on-study PSA kinetics changes
were induced by the study drugs. Ultimately, the findings
of this study will require confirmation in prospective trials
using more effective agents as well as longer and more
regimented follow-up.
In conclusion, this hypothesis-generating analysis
suggests that within-subject changes in PSA kinetics (PSA
doubling time, PSA slope) after initiation of nonhormonal experimental therapies may correlate with MFS in
men with noncastrate PSA-recurrent prostate cancer. If
these findings are validated in prospective trials using
MFS as the primary endpoint, changes in PSA kinetics
may represent a reasonable intermediate endpoint for
screening new agents in this patient population. A prospective randomized trial aiming to validate these retrospective data is currently being designed.

slope after initiation of a nonhormonal experimental therapy.

between the study drugs and PSA kinetics changes cannot
be proven in the absence of placebo control arms. A
change in PSA kinetics after study entry, for example, may
have been caused by more frequent PSA assessments onstudy compared with prestudy PSA evaluations (which
would not have been regulated). To this end, in a placebocontrolled trial evaluating the effect of celecoxib on
PSADT in a similar patient population, 20% of 40 men
in the placebo group had a posttreatment PSADT that
was 200% of baseline.18 Finally, this study suffers from
the known limitations of the landmark method,34
although this method was appropriately used here. For
instance, this approach may result in loss of statistical
power if a significant number of events (ie, metastases, in
