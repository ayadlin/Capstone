ABSTRACT
Microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3)-II is essential for
autophagosome formation and is widely used to monitor autophagic activity. We show
that CGK733 induces LC3 II and LC3-puncta accumulation, which are not involved in
the activation of autophagy. The treatment of CGK733 did not alter the autophagic flux
and was unrelated to p62 degradation. Treatment with CGK733 activated the AMPactivated protein kinase (AMPK) and protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum
kinase/CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (PERK/CHOP) pathways
and elevated the expression of p21Waf1/Cip1. Inhibition of both AMPK and PERK/CHOP
pathways by siRNA or chemical inhibitor could block CGK733-induced p21Waf1/Cip1
expression as well as caspase-3 cleavage. Knockdown of LC3 B (but not LC3 A)
abolished CGK733-triggered LC3 II accumulation and consequently diminished AMPK
and PERK/CHOP activity as well as p21Waf1/Cip1 expression. Our results demonstrate
that CGK733-triggered LC3 II formation is an initial event upstream of the AMPK and
PERK/CHOP pathways, both of which control p21Waf1/Cip1 expression.

may be helpful to resolve the problem of discerning what
is and what is not autophagy [10, 11].
CGK733 has been reported to be involved in cell
growth in drug-induced senescent tumor cells and trigger
apoptotic death [12]. In our present study, we investigate
the effects of CGK733 on the intracellular signaling
pathways and autophagy. We show that CGK733 induced
LC3 II and LC3-puncta formation in an autophagyindependent manner. Following treated with CGK733,
there is no alteration in the autophagic flux and p62mediated degradation. Interestingly, however, the
accumulated LC3 II directly triggers the activation of
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the protein
kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase/CCAATenhancer-binding protein homologous protein (PERK/
CHOP) signaling pathway, as well as expression of
p21Waf1/Cip1.

INTRODUCTION
Microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain
3 (LC3)/autophagy-related gene 8 (ATG8), which has
three isoforms in humans (LC3A, LC3B, and LC3C),
is a ubiquitin-like protein required for autophagosome
formation [1–4]. Lysosomal turnover of LC3-II can
directly mirror autophagic activity, and detecting LC3 by
immunoblotting or immunofluorescence is so far a reliable
method for monitoring autophagy and autophagy-related
processes [5]. Recently, LC3 has also been found to be
critical for other pathophysiological vesicular pathways
[6–8].
LC3 directly binds with protein 62 (p62/SQSTM1)
resulting in the autophagy-independent protein
aggregation and LC3-puncta formation [9, 10]. However,
some studies have shown that immunoblotting of LC3 II

binding directly to LC3 during autophagosome-lysosome
degradation [16]. Therefore we analyzed the levels of p62
expression as well as total intracellular ubiquitination and
p62 binding with LC3 after cells were exposed to CGK733.
The expression of p62 was not reduced and total protein
ubiquitination was not altered by CGK733 (Supplementary
Figure S2). Co-immunoprecipitation showed that p62-LC3
binding was not elevated (but diminished) after cells were
exposed to CGK733 for 6 h (Figure 2D). Likewise, the
co-localization of p62 and GFP-LC3 dots could not be
observed following CGK733 treatment, but was present
in the untreated control (Figure 2E). CQ was used in this
experiment to visualize LC3-puncta in untreated cells.
These data indicate that CGK733-induced LC3 II and
LC3-puncta formation were not accompanied by p62 cooperation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that
the CGK733-induced autophagy-like event does not have
the essential features or function of canonical autophagy.

CGK733 induces LC3 II and LC3-puncta
formation
To test if CGK733 induces LC3 II and LC3-puncta
formation, immunoblotting and immunofluorescent assays
were performed using anti-LC3 antibodies, following
GFP-LC3 gene transfection. A significant up-regulation
of the LC3-II bands resulted from treatment of pancreatic
cancer cell lines with CGK733 for 6 h, in a dosedependent manner (Figure 1A and 1B). The LC3-puncta
assay was performed by using two different methods
(GFP-LC3 transfection and anti-LC3 antibody staining)
in PK45-p and PK59 cells respectively. The number of
LC3-puncta was shown to be significantly increased after
cells were exposed to CGK733 for 6 h compared to the
non-treated controls (Figure 1C and 1D). This result was
also obtained in healthy NIH 3T3 cells after treatment with
CGK733 for 6 h (Supplementary Figure S1). LC3-II is
the lipidated form of LC3 that specifically correlates with
autophagosome membranes, and has been widely used to
study autophagy as an autophagosome marker [1, 13]. In
order to confirm the role of LC3 in our experiment, we
next queried whether CGK733 induces autophagy.

CGK733 up-regulates P21Waf1/Cip1 through AMPK
and the PERK/CHOP signaling pathway
Interestingly, treatment with CGK733 greatly
activated AMPK (phospho-AMPK at Thr 172), the PERK/
CHOP signaling pathway and the expression of p211/Cip1
(Figure 3A). AMPK phosphorylation (at Thr 172), is
essential for the activation of AMPK, and is required for
autophagy by inhibiting mammalian target of Rapamycin
(mTOR)-dependent signaling [17]. PERK facilitates
survival of extracellular matrix-detached cells by
concomitantly promoting autophagy [18]. We then tested
whether AMPK phosphorylation and/or PERK mediated
LC3 II formation were induced by the treatment with
CGK733. Cells were transfected with AMPK siRNA or
treated with PERK inhibitor (GSK2606414) before being
exposed to CGK733. Immunoblotting showed that neither
knockdown of AMPK nor inhibition of PERK altered the
CGK733-induced LC3 II formation (Figure 3B and 3C).
However, both of them blocked the CGK733-induced
expression of p21Waf1/Cip1 (Figure 3B and 3C). We further
showed that knockdown of PERK`s downstream executor,
CHOP, by siRNA also failed to induce LC3 II formation,
but blocked the expression of p21Waf1/Cip1 induced by the
treatment with CGK733 (Figure 3D). Moreover, inhibition
of the PERK/CHOP signaling pathway by PERK inhibitor
or CHOP siRNA could increase as well as enhance the
CGK733-inducecd AMPK phosphorylation (Figure 3C
and 3D), indicating a negative role for PERK/CHOP in
AMPK activation. In addition, CGK733-induced cleavage
of caspase-3 was diminished when both AMPK and
CHOP were inhibited by siRNAs (Figure 3E). Thus, LC3
II formation is not consequently downstream of CGK733induced AMPK and PERK/CHOP activation. These
results indicate that CGK733 induces the expression of
p21Waf1/Cip1 through the AMPK and PERK/CHOP signaling
pathways.

CGK733-induced LC3 II formatiom is
autophagy-independent
Since autophagy is an intracellular degradation
system that transports cytoplasmic materials to the
lysosomes [14], we tested whether GCK733 can activate
the autophagic flux and stimulate autophagic degradation.
Chloroquine (CQ), which causes lysosome dysfunction
and blocks fusion of the autophagosome with the
lysosome [15], was used to detect autophagic flux during
treatment with CGK733. Autophagosomes accumulated
in PK59 cells following CQ treatment compared to the
untreated control (Figure 2A). However, no significant
difference was observed in the number of LC3-puncta
formed in cells after treatment with CGK733 (20 μM) in
combination with CQ compared to CGK733 alone by an
LC3-puncta assay (Figure 2A). Immunoblotting was also
performed to validate the accumulation of LC3-lipidation
by treatment with CGK733 in combination with or without
CQ. Expectedly, CQ could not enhance the LC3-lipidation
induced by treatment with 20 μM of CGK733 (Figure 2B
and 2C) (although it could with just 10 μM of CGK733).
It is possible that 10 μM of CGK733 might not be enough
to overcome the intrinsic autophagy by CQ causing the
enhancement of LC3-lipidation. These results indicate
that CGK733-induced LC3-puncta structures may lack
a mechanism for auto-lysosomal formation (fusion and
degradation by lysosomes). On the other hand, the p62
protein (SQSTM1) is a ubiquitin-binding scaffold protein
that holds ubiquitinated proteins to the autophagosomes by

an initial event upstream of both AMPK and PERK/CHOP
signaling pathways. It is hypothesised that this is possibly
via binding of LC3 with ULK1 [38, 39], which brings
about the binding with AMPK and activation of PERK.
The role of AMPK in mediating autophagy and
inducing LC3 B has been previously reported, either
via FoxO3a transcription factor activation or direct
inhibition of AMPK by a chemical inhibitor or siRNA
[40, 41]. Similarly, the link between LC3 B and the
PERK/CHOP activity has been previously shown with
knockdown of CHOP inhibiting LC3 B-II expression
in Hepatitis C virus infected cells [42]. Another study
reported a reduction in the number of GFP-LC3 B dots
in GFP-LC3 B-transfected HT29 cells treated with
the Ca2+ ion pump protein inhibitor Thapsigargin [43].
However this is the first report of LC3 B being upstream
of both AMPK and PERK/CHOP signaling pathways
(Figure 4D).

DISCUSSION
In the present study the treatment of pancreatic
cancer cell lines with CGK733 for 6 h resulted in the
expression of LC3-II and formation of LC3-II puncta in a
dose-dependent manner. However, these CGK733-induced
LC3-puncta appear to be exclusive of canonical autophagy
as they were accompanied by unaltered expression of p62
and total protein ubiquitination, and presented reduced
p62-LC3 colocalization or binding. The independence
of p62 (and its related protein NBR1) from LC3 was
previously shown in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)associated autophagosome formation [19].
Moreover, CGK733 treatment increased expression
of phospho-AMPK (at Thr 172), PERK, p21Waf1/Cip1 and
cleaved caspase-3. Neither AMPK knockdown nor PERK
inhibition or CHOP knockdown could alter the CGK733induced LC3 II formation. However, these inhibitions
blocked the CGK733-induced expression of p21Waf1/Cip1 and
caspase-3 cleavage. This indicates that while these two
events are a direct consequence of CGK733 on the AMPK
and PERK/CHOP signaling pathways, the observed LC3
II formation is not.
The activation of p21WAF1/CIP1 by CGK733 is the
Gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cell lines tested is
very interesting as p21WAF1/CIP1 is known to be involved in
mediating p53-dependent cell cycle arrest following DNA
damage [20–22] but can also inhibit apoptosis [23–27].
This means that while its former function makes it a tumor
suppressor, its latter function makes it an oncogene. It has
been shown that p21WAF1/CIP1 acts as a tumor suppressor
in the colon, liver and renal cancers of mice [28, 29]
while being an oncogene in lymphomas, gliomas, rectal
and esophageal squamous cell carcinomas [23, 30–36].
Induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 by chemotherapy agents (Irinotecan
or doxorubicin) was shown to lead to senescence in
mesothelial, breast, lung and colon carcinomas, thus
blocking apoptosis [37]. Of particular interest is that when
senescent breast, lung, and colon carcinoma cells were
treated with CGK733, it led to suppression of p21WAF1/CIP1
[12]. However, PK59 cells are not senescent and CGK733
induces them to shift to S phase (Supplementary Figure
S3). This means that p21WAF1/CIP1 is acting as an oncogene.
In the present study it was possible to show that
CGK733-induced LC3 II and GFP-LC3 puncta formation
are due to LC3 B but not LC3 A, and while LC3 B
knockdown blocked the CGK733-activation of AMPK and
PERK/CHOP as well as expression of p21Waf1/Cip1, these
were in contrast enhanced after LC3 A knockdown. Thus,
the major original result from this research is that in the
Gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cell lines tested,
the LC3 B-dependent GK733-induced LC3 II formation is
