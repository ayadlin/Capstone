hypercalcaemia, making this a major cause of morbidity.
Histomorphometric studies have shown that myeloma-induced
bone loss is mediated by an increase in osteoclastic bone
resorption (1–3).
One molecule reported to play a key role in osteoclastogenesis in
myeloma is the receptor activator of nuclear factor nB ligand
(RANKL; ref. 4). RANKL, a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family
member, binds to its receptor RANK on osteoclast precursors to
stimulate osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption (5, 6). RANKL also
binds a secreted decoy receptor, osteoprotegerin, which prevents
RANKL binding RANK and thus inhibits osteoclast formation and
bone resorption (7–9). Myeloma cells hijack the RANKL/osteoprotegerin system, which is required for normal bone remodeling
(10–13). Myeloma cells express RANKL and can promote osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption in a stromal cell–independent
manner in vitro (14–16). The myeloma cells can also up-regulate the
expression of RANKL in cells found in the bone marrow, including
osteoblasts, fibroblasts, stromal cells, and endothelial cells (10, 17),
and down-regulate the production of the decoy receptor osteoprotegerin in osteoblasts and endothelial cells (11, 18). These activities
allow bone resorption to go unchecked.
Targeting this system offers the possibility of developing novel
therapeutic approaches to treating myeloma bone disease (19–21).
Fc-osteoprotegerin has been shown to decrease osteoclast number
and prevent the development of lytic bone disease in the 5T2MM
murine model of myeloma (22). Fc-osteoprotegerin also decreases
tumor burden and increases survival in the 5T33MM murine model
for myeloma (23). Furthermore, administration of a recombinant
osteoprotegerin construct to multiple myeloma patients resulted in
the reduction of biochemical markers of bone resorption (24).
However, osteoprotegerin has been shown to bind another TNF
family member, the TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL;
ref. 25), and can inhibit TRAIL-induced apoptosis of human
myeloma cells (26). Osteoprotegerin produced by osteoblasts has
been shown to prevent the actions of TRAIL (26, 27). This raises the
possibility that osteoprotegerin not only inhibits osteoclastogenesis
but may also play a role in promoting tumor cell survival (27–29).
Whether or not osteoprotegerin can bind TRAIL and prevent
apoptosis in vivo and the relative importance of osteoprotegerin
binding to TRAIL and RANKL are unclear. It is likely that these two
different activities may play key roles at different stages in disease
development. During tumor initiation and the initial arrival and
colonization, osteoprotegerin may function to prevent TRAIL from
targeting tumor cells for removal. Whereas, once the tumor is
established and is environment independent, down-regulation of
osteoprotegerin may allow RANKL-driven osteoclast formation to
go unchecked. Developing tools to selectively regulate these two
activities is critical.

Abstract
Multiple myeloma is a B-cell malignancy characterized by the
uncontrolled growth of plasma cells in the bone marrow and
the development of osteolytic bone disease. Myeloma cells
express the receptor activator of nuclear factor KB ligand
(RANKL), induce RANKL expression in the bone marrow, and
down-regulate expression of the decoy receptor osteoprotegerin, thereby promoting bone resorption. Targeting this
system in myeloma has clear therapeutic potential. However,
osteoprotegerin also binds tumor necrosis factor–related
apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) and prevents TRAILinduced apoptosis of myeloma cells. Whether or not osteoprotegerin can bind TRAIL and prevent apoptosis in vivo
and the relative importance of osteoprotegerin binding to
TRAIL and RANKL are unclear. In the present study, we
have investigated the ability of an osteoprotegerin-like peptidomimetic (OP3-4), designed to block the RANKL/RANK
interaction, to inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption and
TRAIL-induced apoptosis in vitro and myeloma bone disease
in vivo. OP3-4 inhibited osteoclast formation (P < 0.01) and
bone resorption (P < 0.01) in vitro. However, OP3-4 had no
effect on TRAIL-induced apoptosis of RPMI 8226 myeloma
cells. Treatment of 5T2MM myeloma–bearing mice with OP3-4
decreased osteoclast number and the proportion of bone
surface covered by osteoclasts (P < 0.05). Treatment also
prevented the tumor-induced decrease in cancellous bone
area and the development of osteolytic lesions (P < 0.05).
OP3-4 also reduced tumor burden when compared with the
control (P < 0.05). These data suggest that OP3-4 and the
selective inhibition of RANKL, but not TRAIL activity, are
effective in preventing myeloma bone disease and offer a
novel therapeutic approach to treating this aspect of
myeloma. [Cancer Res 2007;67(1):202–8]

Introduction
Multiple myeloma is a B-cell malignancy characterized by the
infiltration and growth of plasma cells in the bone marrow.
Patients with myeloma develop osteolytic bone disease predominantly in the skull, ribs, vertebrae, pelvis, and proximal long bones.
This is characterized by bone pain, pathologic fractures, and

effect of OP3-4 both on bone resorption and TRAIL-induced
apoptosis in vitro and on osteoclast formation and myeloma bone
disease in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Peptide synthesis. OP3-4 peptide (YCEIEFCYLIR) was designed based
on the three-dimensional structure of modeled osteoprotegerin and
RANKL receptor complex (Fig. 1; ref. 30). The cyclic OP3-4 peptide was
synthesized by the American Peptide Company (Sunnyvale, CA) at a
purity of 95% to 98%. A control peptide (FCYISEVEDQCY), which is
similar in size and net hydrophobicity to OP3-4, was purchased from the
Protein Chemistry Laboratory, University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia,
PA). The purity and identity of the peptides were confirmed by reversephase high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry.
Both of the peptides were reconstituted in phosphate buffered saline
(PBS; pH 7.5).
Effect of OP3-4 on murine osteoclastogenesis and bone resoprtion in vitro. Mononuclear cells were isolated from murine whole blood
using Histopaque-1077 (Sigma, Poole, United Kingdom) and seeded onto
glass coverslips in a 96-well plate at a density of 1  105 per well in aMEM (Life Technologies, Paisley, United Kingdom) containing 10% FCS
(Sigma). After 2 h, the coverslips were washed in medium and then
transferred to a 24-well plate (three coverslips per well) with 1 mL of
medium containing dexamethasone (0.1 nmol/L; Sigma), macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (MCSF; 25 ng/mL; R&D Systems, Abingdon,
United Kingdom), and recombinant human RANKL (30 ng/mL;
Peprotech, London, United Kingdom) in the presence or absence of
either PBS, recombinant mouse osteoprotegerin (0.1 Ag/mL; R&D
Systems), control peptide (5–50 Amol/L), or OP3-4 (5–50 Amol/L). The
cells were incubated for 6 days at 37jC. Osteoclasts were stained for
tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity using an acid
phosphatase kit (Sigma). The number of TRAP-positive multinucleated
osteoclasts was counted manually using light microscopy (Leica
Microsystems, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom).

Figure 1. Three-dimensional model of the osteoprotegerin/RANKL complex.
The model was built based on the three-dimensional structures of the
TNF-h-TNF receptor 1 complex (37), TRAIL-death receptor 5 complex (38), and
Fas-Fas ligand complex. The receptor complex is shown as a spherical model.
Osteoprotegerin (OPG ) is colored according to atom (green, C; blue, N; red,
O; orange, S) and, for clarity, the ligand is shown in orange. The critical loop
OP3-4 is shown in cyan from which the mimetic used
in this study was designed.

One mechanism for selectively targeting the RANKL system is
through the use of osteoprotegerin-like peptidomimetics. We have
designed an osteoprotegerin-like peptidomimetic (OP3-4), modeled
on the TNF-h-TNF receptor 1 complex, TRAIL-death receptor 5
complex, and Fas-Fas ligand complex, and showed that it functions
by inhibiting the RANKL/RANK system (30). However, it is unclear
whether it will inhibit bone resorption and block the actions of
TRAIL. Therefore, in the present study, we have determined the

TRAIL-induced apoptosis of human RPMI

RPMI 8226 cells were cultured in the

peptide for 24 h and then stained with DAPI
and visualized using confocal microscopy

peptide, as it was shown not to differ in all in vitro experiments. After
12 weeks, mice were sacrificed and the effect of OP3-4 on myeloma
bone disease was assessed. All procedures involving mice were approved
by the local Research Ethics Committee (license no. LA1230281) and met
the standards required by the UK Coordinating Committee on Cancer
Research 1998 guidelines.
Radiographic and histologic analysis of bone disease and tumor
burden. The tibiae were X-rayed using a Hewlett Packard Faxitron
(McMinnville, OR). X-rays were then scanned and enlarged, and the number
of osteolytic lesions was counted manually. Tibia were fixed in 10% neutral
buffered formalin, decalcified in EDTA, and embedded in paraffin, and 3-Am
sections were cut using a Leica Microsystems microtome. The sections were
stained for either H&E or TRAP to identify osteoclasts and counterstained
with Gill’s hematoxylin. The sections were examined by light microscopy
(Leica Microsystems). The number of osteolytic lesions that penetrated the
full thickness of the cortical bone in each tibia was counted manually.
Cancellous bone area was measured in an area 0.5625 mm2, 0.25 mm from
the growth plate on three different tissue levels per bone using the
osteomeasure analysis software (Osteometrics, Decatur, GA). The number of
osteoclasts per millimeter and the percentage surface covered by
osteoclasts were measured on 6.5 mm of the corticoendosteal surfaces,
starting 0.25 mm from the growth plate. Tumor burden was analyzed by
measuring the percentage area occupied by tumor cells (25 fields, each field
of view was 0.0625 mm2, starting 0.25 mm from the growth plate). Apoptotic
myeloma cells were analyzed by measuring the proportion of apoptotic
tumor cells (10 fields, each field of view was 0.0156 mm2, starting 0.25 mm
from the growth plate). Apoptotic cells were defined by characteristic
changes in nuclear morphology, including chromatin condensation and the
presence of two or more distinct apoptotic bodies (36).
Statistical analysis. All experiments were done on a minimum of three
separate occasions and analyzed using ANOVA-Dunnett’s post test. The
histologic and radiographic data from the 5T2MM in vivo experiments were
analyzed using the Mann Whitney U test. All results are expressed as the
mean F SD.

In separate experiments, mononuclear cells were cultured on elephant
dentine slices (a gift from HM Customs and Excise, High Wycombe, United
Kingdom) for 10 days. The cells were removed by incubation with trypsin
(Life Technologies) for 10 min, 1 mol/L ammonium hydroxide for 4 h, and
then sonication in water for 30 s. The resorption pits were stained with
0.05% toluidine blue solution for 5 min. The proportion of dentine slice
covered by resorption pits was determined using light microscopy (Leica
Microsystems) and the Leica Qwin software program.
Effect of OP3-4 on TRAIL-induced apoptosis of human myeloma
cells in vitro. RPMI 8226 human myeloma cells, obtained from the
European Collection of Animal Cell Culture (Salisbury, United Kingdom),
were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies) containing 10% FCS
(Sigma). RPMI 8226 cells were seeded into six-well plates at a density of
5  105/mL in the presence or absence of TRAIL (20 ng/mL; R&D Systems).
To each well, either PBS, human recombinant osteoprotegerin (0.05 Ag/mL;
R&D Systems), control peptide (5–50 Amol/L), or OP3-4 (5–50 Amol/L) was
added. Cells were incubated for 24 h and the proportion of nonviable cells
was determined following trypan blue exclusion. Cells were then fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde, cytospun onto glass slides, stained with 4¶,6-diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI; 1 Ag/mL), and visualized under UV light. Apoptotic
cells were defined as those with condensed chromatin and the presence of
apoptotic bodies. The proportion of apoptotic cells was determined in five
fields of view. Apoptosis was also assessed using a fluorescence in situ nick
translation assay as previously described (31). The proportion of cells
undergoing apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur,
Becton Dickinson, Oxford, United Kingdom).
Treatment of 5T2MM myeloma–bearing mice with OP3-4. The
5T2MM murine model of multiple myeloma originated spontaneously in
elderly C57BL/KaLwRiJ mice (32, 33). Thirty-six female C57BL/KaLwRij
mice (Harlan) were divided into three groups: group 1 (n = 12) were left
uninjected (naive group) and groups 2 and 3 (n = 12 each) were
injected via the tail vein with 5T2MM cells that were isolated and
purified from the bone marrow of disease-bearing mice as previously
described (34). Progression of the disease was assessed by measuring
the presence of the serum paraprotein using standard electrophoretic
techniques (35). When the paraprotein was detected (at f9 weeks),
mice in groups 2 and 3 were treated with either vehicle (300 AL of PBS)
or OP3-4 (300 AL at 346 Amol/L = 6 mg/kg), given i.v. three times a
week for 3 weeks. PBS was used as a control rather than the control

reduced histologically detectable osteolytic lesions in 5T2MMbearing mice as compared with mice treated with vehicle (0.4 F
0.7 versus 1.9 F 1.9; P < 0.05). Histomorphometric analysis of
cancellous bone area showed the presence of cancellous bone in
naive mice (Fig. 6A). Cancellous bone was significantly reduced in
the 5T2MM-bearing mice as compared with naive mice (0.5 F
0.6% versus 2.5 F 0.9%; P < 0.001; Fig. 6B). Treatment of 5T2MM
tumor–bearing mice with OP3-4 partially prevented 5T2MMinduced cancellous bone loss (1.4 F 1.9% versus 0.5 F 0.6%);

in the presence of soluble RANKL and MCSF formed multinucleated TRAP-positive osteoclasts (Fig. 2A). When cultured on
dentine slices, these cells formed resorption pits (Fig. 2C).
Assessment of the number of TRAP-positive multinucleated
osteoclasts and resorption pits showed that recombinant
osteoprotegerin completely inhibited osteoclast formation and
bone resorption (Fig. 2B and D, respectively). Addition of OP3-4
also inhibited the formation of TRAP-positive osteoclasts in a
dose-dependent manner, with 30 Amol/L OP3-4 being adequate
to completely inhibit osteoclast formation (0.0 F 0.11% versus
67.7 F 17.0%; P < 0.01). This is consistent with our previous data
showing that OP3-4 inhibits the formation of osteoclasts
generated from murine bone marrow osteoclast precursors (30).
Similarly, 30 Amol/L OP3-4 significantly inhibited bone resorption
(3.1 F 5.6% versus 90.0 F 36.9%; P < 0.01; Fig. 2D). Control
peptide had no significant effect on osteoclast formation or bone
resorption. These data show that OP3-4 is able to prevent
RANKL-induced osteoclast formation and bone resorption in a
similar manner to osteoprotegerin.
OP3-4 does not promote myeloma cell survival in vitro.
Osteoprotegerin has been shown to block TRAIL-induced apoptosis; however, it is unclear whether OP3-4 has a similar effect. TRAIL
(20 ng/mL) caused an increase in apoptosis of RPMI 8226 human
myeloma cells (Fig. 3A). Recombinant osteoprotegerin significantly
inhibited TRAIL-induced myeloma cell apoptosis (P < 0.01). In
contrast, OP3-4 and the control peptide did not inhibit TRAILinduced cell apoptosis (Fig. 3B). Assessment of the number of
nonviable cells using trypan blue (Fig. 3C) also showed that
recombinant osteoprotegerin inhibited TRAIL-induced myeloma
cell apoptosis whereas OP3-4 had no effect. These results were also
confirmed using the nick translation method (OP3-4 versus vehicle
control, 34.0 F 4.4% versus 47.6 F 7.5%). These data confirm that
OP3-4 at the concentrations examined had no effect on TRAILinduced apoptosis of myeloma cells.
OP3-4 inhibits osteoclast formation in the 5T2MM model.
Injection of 5T2MM cells into C57BL/KaLwRijHsd mice resulted in
the development of a serum paraprotein in all animals. Histologic
assessment of the tibia showed the presence of TRAP-positive
osteoclasts on the corticoendosteal surface of naive mice (Fig. 4A).
The presence of 5T2MM cells was associated with a significant
increase in the number of osteoclasts per millimeter (Fig. 4B) and
the percentage of bone surface covered by osteoclasts (Fig. 4C) as
compared with naive mice (9.0 F 3.1/mm versus 2.2 F 2.1/mm and
24.9 F 8.7% versus 4.1 F 2.7%; P < 0.001). Treatment of the
5T2MM-bearing mice with OP3-4 reduced the number of
osteoclasts and the surface covered by osteoclasts as compared
with mice treated with vehicle (6.3 F 3.1/mm versus 9.0 F 3.1/mm
and 17.0 F 8.4% versus 24.9 F 8.7%; P < 0.05). These data are
consistent with OP3-4 inhibiting 5T2MM-induced osteoclast
formation in vivo.
OP3-4 inhibits the development of osteolytic bone disease
in the 5T2MM model. X-ray analysis of the long bones of
5T2MM-bearing mice showed the presence of osteolytic lesions
(Fig. 5A). Lesions were present in 5T2MM-bearing mice but not in
naive mice (7.5 F 4.1 versus 0.4 F 0.5; Fig. 5B). Treatment of
5T2MM-bearing mice with OP3-4 resulted in a significant
reduction in osteolytic lesions when compared with mice treated
with vehicle (3.7 F 2.4 versus 7.5 F 4.1; P < 0.05). Histologic
analysis of the tibia showed the presence of osteolytic lesions in
the cortex of 5T2MM-bearing mice but not in naive mice (1.9 F
1.9 versus 0.0 F 0.0; P < 0.01; Fig. 5C and D). OP3-4 significantly

however, this was not statistically significant. Cancellous bone
area in the OP3-4 treatment group was not significantly different
from that in naive mice.
OP3-4 reduces tumor burden in the 5T2MM model.
Histomorphometric analysis of tumor burden in the tibia (Fig. 6A
and C) showed that 86.1 F 23.6% of the bone marrow cavity was
occupied by 5T2MM myeloma cells. Treatment of the 5T2MM
tumor–bearing mice with OP3-4 significantly reduced tumor
burden in the tibia when compared with 5T2MM-bearing mice
treated with vehicle (59.0 F 32.0% versus 86.1 F 23.6%; P < 0.05).
OP3-4 also reduced serum paraprotein in 5T2MM-bearing mice as
compared with 5T2MM-bearing mice treated with vehicle by 29%
(0.7 F 0.5 versus 1.0 F 0.7g/100 mL), although this was not
statistically significant. There was no difference in the proportion
of 5T2MM cells undergoing apoptosis in the OP3-4-treated
mice compared with vehicle-treated mice (0.23 F 0.30% versus
0.32 F 0.34%; P > 0.05).

These data are consistent with the observation that osteoprotegerin also prevents osteoclast formation and bone resorption in the
same system. In contrast, OP3-4, at the same concentration, had no
effect on TRAIL-induced apoptosis of myeloma cells, whereas
osteoprotegerin was effective at preventing TRAIL-induced apoptosis. These data suggest that the structural determinants of
osteoprotegerin binding to RANKL and osteoprotegerin binding to
TRAIL may differ. A detailed understanding of the threedimensional structure of these two receptor complexes may allow
the rational design of inhibitors that can selectively block the
activity of these two different interactions.
Because OP3-4 was able to inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption,
but had little effect on TRAIL in vitro, studies were undertaken to
determine its effects on osteoclast bone resorption in vivo. 5T2MM
murine myeloma cells were injected into C57BL/KaLwRijHsd mice.
The tumor cells promoted a significant increase in osteoclastic
bone resorption. Treatment with OP3-4 significantly decreased the
surface covered by osteoclasts. This is consistent with a significant
inhibitory effect on osteoclast formation. The inhibitory effect of
OP3-4 on osteoclast formation partially prevented tumor-induced
cancellous bone loss. The partial effect may reflect the fact that the
treatment started when serum paraprotein was detected and
significant bone loss may have already occurred. However,
treatment was able to significantly decrease the presence of lytic
bone lesions. These data are consistent with the demonstration
that OP3-4 prevents bone loss in ovariectomized mice (30).
However, OP3-4 was not as effective at decreasing osteoclast
formation and the surface covered by osteoclasts as we observed
with a recombinant Fc-osteoprotegerin fusion protein (22). In this
previous study, Fc-osteoprotegerin completely inhibited osteoclast
formation, which contrasts with the partial inhibition seen in the
present study. The reason for this is unclear. The concentration of
OP3-4 required to inhibit osteoclast formation in vitro was at least
1,000-fold greater than osteoprotegerin. This suggests that the

Discussion
The bone destruction associated with multiple myeloma is a
major cause of morbidity. Myeloma cells seem to hijack the
RANKL/osteoprotegerin system in favor of RANKL, promoting
increased osteoclastic bone resorption. Inhibiting RANKL represents a novel strategy for targeting this aspect of the disease. In
support of this, we have shown that recombinant osteoprotegerin
prevents myeloma bone disease and decreases tumor burden in
murine models of myeloma (22, 23). Furthermore, osteoprotegerin
has been shown to reduce biochemical markers of bone
resorption in patients with myeloma (24). However, osteoprotegerin can bind another TNF family member, TRAIL, to prevent
TRAIL-induced apoptosis, which may confound the effect of
osteoprotegerin.
The present study showed that OP3-4 prevents osteoclast
formation and bone resorption in a functional osteoclast assay.

the TNF-h-TNF receptor 1 complex (37), TRAIL-death receptor 5
complex (38), and Fas-Fas ligand complex. Peptidomimetics
designed on the basis of the structure of the osteoprotegerin/
RANKL complex when it is solved may allow improved peptide
design. In addition, OP3-4 may have been less effective than
osteoprotegerin simply due to its small size/surface area and,
therefore, OP3-4 was only able to modify the RANKL/RANK
interaction, rather than completely blocking activity. However,
these data are consistent with the demonstration that Fcosteoprotegerin can reduce osteolytic bone disease in the same
model (22) and that soluble RANK-Fc constructs also block bone
disease in vivo (10, 39).
OP3-4 also significantly reduced tumor burden in the 5T2MM
model. Further analysis showed that OP3-4 treatment did not
affect myeloma cell apoptosis in vivo. This suggests that changes
in rates of apoptosis do not contribute to the reduction in tumor
burden. The mechanism responsible for the reduction is unclear;
however, a similar reduction was seen in separate studies when
bone resorption was inhibited with either Fc-osteoprotegerin or a
bisphosphonate (23, 40). In this previous study, Fc-osteoprotegerin was shown not to have a direct antimyeloma effect. These
data are consistent with the hypothesis that the reduction in
tumor burden is likely to reflect an indirect effect on tumor
growth via changes in the bone microenvironment caused by the
inhibition of bone resorption. The use of OP3-4 in established
disease (i.e., once a serum paraprotein had been detected)
allowed study of the effect of the peptide on osteoclast biology
and the development of bone disease, but not on initiation and
colonization in bone.
We hypothesize that osteoprotegerin plays a different role in
different stages of disease development. In the early stage of
tumor development (initial arrival/colonization), osteoprotegerin
may function to prevent TRAIL from targeting tumor cells for
removal. However, once the tumor is established and becomes
microenvironment independent, osteoprotegerin is down-regulated and plays a role in the development of myeloma bone
disease. The question of whether osteoprotegerin binding to
TRAIL in vivo is of biological significance is key to this hypothesis
and is being addressed in separate studies. However, we believe
that the current study provides data to show not only that smallmolecule mimetics can prevent myeloma bone disease but also
that this approach may be of value in distinguishing these two
activities.
Taken together, these data suggest that OP3-4 and the selective
inhibition of RANKL, but not TRAIL, activity are effective in
preventing myeloma bone disease. Refining the design of such
peptides may improve efficacy and allow their use in both
dissecting the relative importance of osteoprotegerin/RANKL
interactions versus osteoprotegerin/TRAIL interactions. This may
lead to improved therapeutic approaches for treating myeloma and
the associated bone disease.

Figure 6. OP3-4 reduces trabecular bone loss and tumor burden in the 5T2MM
tumor–bearing mice. A, H&E-stained sections of the tibia of naive mice and
5T2MM tumor–bearing mice treated with either vehicle or OP3-4. Trabecular
bone (white arrows ) was present in the naive mice and OP3-4–treated 5T2MMbearing mice, but not in vehicle-treated 5T2MM-bearing mice. Tumor (black
arrows ) was present in 5T2MM-bearing mice treated with vehicle and was
reduced by OP3-4. B, histologic assessment of trabecular bone area as a
percentage of total area in naive and 5T2MM-bearing mice treated with either
vehicle or OP3-4. 5T2MM tumor–bearing mice had significant trabecular bone
loss in the tibia, whereas OP3-4 partially inhibited trabecular bone loss in these
mice. C, histologic assessment of tumor burden in naive and 5T2MM-bearing
mice treated with either vehicle or OP3-4. 5T2MM tumor–bearing mice treated
with OP3-4 had significantly reduced tumor burden. ***, P < 0.001; *, P < 0.05;

relative affinity of OP3-4 for RANKL is likely to be much lower than
osteoprotegerin for RANKL. This may reflect a requirement for the
full-length molecule to bind and position the OP3-4 sequence for
optimal interaction with RANKL. Alternatively, the design of the
OP3-4 peptide may not be the most favorable. Indeed, the threedimensional structure of osteoprotegerin is not known, and the
OP3-4 peptide was designed by modeling the osteoprotegerin/
RANKL interaction based on the three-dimensional structures of
