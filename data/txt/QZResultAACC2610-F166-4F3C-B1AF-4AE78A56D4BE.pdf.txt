Abstract
Aberrant N-linked glycans promote the malignant potential of
cells by enhancing the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
and the invasive phenotype. To identify small molecule
inhibitors of N-glycan biosynthesis, we developed a chemical
screen based on the ability of the tetravalent plant lectin
L-phytohemagglutinin (L-PHA) to bind and crosslink surface
glycoproteins with B1,6GlcNAc-branched complex type
N-glycans and thereby induce agglutination and cell death.
In this screen, Jurkat cells were treated with a library of offpatent chemicals (n = 1,280) to identify molecules that blocked
L-PHA–induced death. The most potent hit from this screen
was the cardiac glycoside (CG) dihydroouabain. In secondary
assays, a panel of CGs was tested for their effects on L-PHA–
induced agglutination and cell death. All of the CGs tested
inhibited L-PHA–induced death in Jurkat cells, and the
most potent CG tested was digoxin with an EC50 of 60 F
20 nmol/L. Digoxin also increased the fraction of some
concanavalin A–binding N-glycans. Using matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry,
digoxin specifically increased GlcNAc1Man3GlcNAc2Fuc1 and
GlcNAc2Man3GlcNAc2Fuc1 oligosaccharides demonstrating an
impairment of the N-glycan pathway. Consistent with this
effect on the N-glycan pathway, digoxin inhibited N-glycosylation–mediated processes of tumor cell migration and
invasion. Furthermore, digoxin prevented distant tumor
formation in two mouse models of metastatic prostate cancer.
Thus, taken together, our high throughput screen identified
CGs as modifiers of the N-glycan pathway. These molecules
can be used as tools to better understand the role of N-glycans
in normal and malignant cells. Moreover, these results may
partly explain the anticancer effect of CGs in cardiovascular
patients. [Cancer Res 2008;68(16):6688–97]

expression of the Golgi enzymes that generate h1,6GlcNAcbranched tetraantennary N-glycans. These N-glycans are found
on proteins including growth factor receptors and integrins, and
have been shown to enhance growth signaling in motile tumor
cells (2–4). Chemical or genetic disruption of the N-glycosylation
pathway in cancer cells decreases these malignant features (5, 6).
Therefore, targeting defective glycosylation pathways may be a
novel approach for the treatment of malignancy and a strategy to
prevent metastasis.
The N-glycosylation pathway begins in the lumen of the rough
endoplasmic reticulum, and remodeling in the Golgi apparatus
generates structural diversity. To initiate the pathway, the
oligosaccharide precursor Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 is transferred en bloc
from dolichol-PPi onto asparagine (Asn) residues in the sequence
Asn-X-Ser/Thr (where X can be any amino acid except for proline)
to form an Asn-linked glycan (N-glycan). Once attached to the
protein, this precursor is modified through a well-defined pathway
leading to the sequential removal of the three glucoses and one
mannose by the actions of rough endoplasmic reticulum glycosidases to form Man8GlcNAc2-Asn. In the Golgi, Man8GlcNAc2-Asn
is further modified by the removal of mannoses via Golgi
mannosidases and by the addition of GlcNAc via GlcNAc
transferases, leading to the generation of hybrid and complex
N-glycans. Finally, other sugars such as fucose, galactose, and sialic
acid are added to the N-glycans to increase their diversity (Fig. 1;
reviewed in refs. 7, 8).
To better understand the N-glycosylation pathway and identify
strategies to target the aberrant N-glycosylation in neoplastic cells,
we designed, automated, and conducted a chemical screen of offpatent drugs and chemicals. This high-throughput screen identified
cardiac glycoside (CG) Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitors that altered
N-glycosylation. Subsequent evaluation showed that inhibition of
the Na+/K+-ATPase increased the fraction of concanavalin A
(ConA)-binding N-glycans. Moreover, the effects of CG on Nglycosylation seemed functionally important as these compounds
inhibited the glycosylation-mediated processes of cell migration
and invasion as well as decreased distant tumor formation in vivo.

Cardiac Glycosides Impair the N-Glycosylation Pathway

Figure 1. Scheme of the N -glycan biosynthesis pathway. The N -glycan biosynthesis pathway is shown. The biosynthesis of N -glycans involves the following
steps: (a ) sequential conversion of the high mannose N -glycan M9Gn2 to M8Gn2, M7Gn2, M6Gn2, and M5Gn2 (oligosaccharides before a-mannosidase II
in Table 1); (b ) addition of h2-linked GlcNAc to the terminal a3-linked Man of M5Gn2 by GlcNAc-TI to form Gn1M5Gn2 (oligosaccharides before a-mannosidase II
in Table 1); (c ) removal of two Man residues from Gn1M5Gn2 by a-mannosidase II to form Gn1M3Gn2 (oligosaccharides after a-mannosidase II-Hybrid
structures in Table 1); (d) addition of a second h2-linked GlcNAc to the terminal a6-linked Man of Gn1M3Gn2 by GlcNAc-TII to form Gn2M3Gn2 (oligosaccharides
after a-mannosidase II-Complex structures in Table 1); (e ) addition of L-Fucose (F ) and Galactose (Hx ) residues. Swainsonine (SW ) is a known inhibitor of the
a-mannosidase II enzyme. OT, oligosaccharyltransferase; GI and GII, the a-glucosidases; TI, TII, TIV , and TV, h-N -acetylglucosaminyltransferases; MI , the

in DMEM. All cells were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS;
Hyclone) and antibiotics. WRO cells were also supplemented with 1 mmol/L
sodium pyruvate. All cell lines were cultured in a standard humidified
incubator at 37jC in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.
High-throughput screen for inhibitors of L-phytohemagglutinin–
induced cell death. Liquid handling was performed by a Biomek FX
Laboratory Automated Workstation (Beckman Coultera). Jurkat cells (5,000
cells per well) were seeded in 96-well plates followed by the addition of
aliquots from the LOPAC library of 1,280 off-patent drugs and chemicals
with a final DMSO concentration of 0.05%. Jurkat cells were selected for this
assay as their growth in suspension conditions facilitated the automated
nature of this screen. Twenty-four hours after addition of the compound
library, L-phytohemagglutinin (L-PHA) was added at a final concentration
of 20 Ag/mL (9). Forty eight hours after the addition of L-PHA, cell viability
was measured using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium inner salt (MTS) reduction assay
according to the manufacture’s protocols (Promega) and as previously
described (10). Cell viability was calculated relative to vehicle-treated (0.1%
DMSO) control cells on each plate. To identify statistically significant hits,
we calculated the Z score for each hit relative to the negative control. These
Z scores were transformed into P values based on the standard-normal
distribution. To control for multiple testing, we used a false discovery rate
(FDR) correction to generate a q value for each compound (11). Statistically
significant hits were selected as those with a q value of <5%, at which level
four compounds were identified.
Measurement of ConA-binding glycopeptides. Quantification of
ConA-binding glycans after swainsonine and digoxin treatment was

performed as follows. Briefly, Jurkat cells (1  107) were treated with
2 Amol/L swainsonine, 100 nmol/L digoxin, or buffer control for 24 h. After
treatment, cells were harvested, washed, and sonicated. The homogenate
was centrifuged and the pellet was solubilized in 6 mol/L guanidine-HCl in
0.1 mol/L Tris buffer (pH 8.0) containing 20 mmol/L DTT to reduce disulfide
bonds. Solid iodoacetamide was then added to a final concentration of
60 mmol/L, and the solution was incubated for 1 h to block free sulfhydryl
groups. The solution was then centrifuged to remove any remaining
insoluble residue. The solubilized, reduced, and alkylated proteins were
precipitated with 10 volumes of cold absolute ethanol-glacial acetic acid.
The pellet was collected, dried, and suspended in 50 mmol/L NH4HCO3.
Trypsin (Promega) at 1:100 (w:w), relative to total protein, was added (half
at the beginning of the digestion and the other half 3 h later), and after an
overnight digestion, the enzyme was denatured by boiling. After proteolysis
and centrifugation, the supernatant was dried and redissolved in PBS. The
peptide mixture was loaded onto a ConA-Sepharose column equilibrated
with PBS buffer. After washing the column using PBS, the ConA-bound
glycopeptides were eluted with 15% methyl-a-D-mannoside in PBS. A
SepPak-C18 cartridge was then used to remove the methyl-a-D-mannoside.
The glycopeptides were eluted from SepPak-C18 with 50% acetonitrile in
0.1% trifluoroacetyl, and the solution was lyophilized. Equal amounts of
material were dissolved in H2O, and the amount of hexose in the sample
was determined by the phenol-sulfuric acid method (12).
ConA binding to cell surface glycans. Cells (500 cells per well) were
seeded in 96-well plates. After adhering overnight, cells were treated with
increasing concentrations of digoxin for 48 h. After treatment, cells were
fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and washed. Surface N-glycans were stained

with ConA (20 Ag/mL) conjugated to tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate (TRITC; EY Laboratories) and nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342.
The total intensity of ConA staining on each cell was quantified using
Cellomics ArrayScan II (Cellomics; ref. 2).
siRNA transfections. Cells (1  105) were seeded in 6-well plates and
transfected the next day using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and doublestranded siRNAs targeting either the human Na+/K+-ATPase, or NonTargering siRNA (siControl; Smartpool, Dharmacon). Cells were harvested
72 h posttransfection and then assayed for ConA binding to cell surface glycans.
Reverse-transcriptase real-time PCR. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 Ag of DNase-treated total cellular RNA using random primers
and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s protocols. Real-time PCR assays were performed in
triplicate with 5 ng of RNA equivalent cDNA, SYBR Green PCR Master
mix (Applied Biosystems), and 400 nmol/L of gene-specific primers.
Reactions were processed and analyzed on an ABI 7900 Sequence Detection
System (Applied Biosystems). Forward/reverse PCR primer pairs for human
cDNAs were as follows: murine Na+/K+-ATPase, Forward 5¶-TGT GAT TCT
GGC TGA GAA CG-3¶ and Reverse 5¶-TCT TGC AGA TGA CCA AGT CG-3¶;
18S, Forward 5¶-AGG AAT TGA CGG AAG GGC AC-3¶ and Reverse 5¶-GGA
CAT CTA AGG GCA TCA CA-3¶. Relative mRNA expression was determined
using the DDCT method as described (13).
DNA constructs and generation of stable cell lines. Stable cell lines
expressing the a subunit of the murine Na+/K+-ATPase were engineered by
transfecting PPC1 human prostate cancer cells with cDNA corresponding to
the murine Na+/K+-ATPase in pcDNA3 vector using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells stably
expressing murine Na+/K+-ATPase were selected with 800 Ag/mL G418
(Invitrogen).
Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass
spectrometry to semiquantify N-glycan expression. Jurkat cells
(1  108) were treated with 100 nmol/L digoxin, 2 Amol/L Swainsonine,
or buffer control. After incubation, cells were lysed in 35 mmol/L Tris,
8 mol/L urea, 4% CHAPS, and 65 mmol/L DTT (pH 8.0) followed by
sonication and freezing. Equal amounts of protein were dialyzed with
cassettes (Slide-A-Lyzer; molecular weight cutoff of 7,000; Pierce) in 10
mmol/L NH4HCO3/0.02% SDS. After dialysis, samples were concentrated
via vacuum centrifugation. Samples were deglycosylated at 37jC for
48 h with PNGase F (New England Biolabs). Oligosaccharides were
purified via C18 and porous graphitized carbon solid phase extraction.
The composition of N-glycans was semiquantified using mass spectrometry via matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass
spectrometry (MALDI-TOF), using DHB as matrix, on a MALDI-CFR
(Shimadzu Biotech) as previously described (14). The intensities of the
peaks were arbitrarily normalized to the level of (Hexose)2(HexNAc)2(Deoxyhexose)1.
Scratch wound–healing assay. Scratch wound–healing assay was
performed as previously described (15, 16). Briefly, HT1080 (1  106) cells
were treated with digoxin or buffer control. After 24 h, cells were harvested
and seeded (1  105) on fibronectin-coated 4-well chamber slides. After
adhering overnight, the monolayer was scratched with a plastic pipette tip.
Migration of the cells over 6 h was captured with a digital camera (Nikon)
mounted on an inverted microscope (Nikon). Cellular migration was
measured in relative units (pixels).
Migration and invasion assays. Invasion and migration assays were
performed as previously described (15). Briefly WRO cells (2  105) were
treated with digoxin or buffer control for 24 h. After treatment, cells were
harvested and seeded in uncoated invasion chambers for migration assay,
or BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chambers (BD Biosciences) in serum-free
RPMI 1640 containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin were used for invasion
assays. Growth medium containing 5% FBS was use as a chemoattractant
in the bottom well. After 24 h of incubation, cells that had migrated or
invaded the lower surface of the membrane were stained with Diff-Quik
Stain (BD Biosciences). The number of migrating or invading cells were
imaged and counted using the Aperio ScanScope CS whole slide Scanner
(Aperio Technologies) and Image-Pro Plus Software (version 4.5; Media
Cybernetics, Inc.).

In vivo studies. The effects of digoxin on distant tumor formation
in vivo were evaluated as previously described (10). Briefly, dsRED-PPC-1
cells that stably express dsRed2 fluorescent protein were treated in culture
with digoxin (100 nmol/L) or buffer control for 20 h. After treatment,
3.5  106 viable cells (as determined by trypan blue exclusion assay) were
either injected via the tail vein or s.c. into the hind limbs into sublethally
irradiated (3.5 Gy) male severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice
between ages 5 and 7 wk. The number of cells injected was at least 3-fold
above the minimum threshold required for distal tumor formation (data not
shown). Mice injected with tumor cells s.c. were maintained for 2 wk and
then sacrificed via carbon dioxide inhalation. Tumors were excised and
weighed. Mice injected with tumor cells i.v. were maintained for 4 wk after
injection or until moribund, at which time, the animals were sacrificed via
carbon dioxide inhalation for complete examination.
In a separate model, DsRed-labeled PPC-1 cells (3  106) were injected
i.v. into sublethally irradiated SCID mice. Mice were then treated with
digoxin or buffer control daily for 2 wk. Four weeks after injection of the
cells, the mice were sacrificed via carbon dioxide inhalation and dissected.
Red fluorescent tumors were detected via whole body imaging and whole
organ imaging using a Leica MZ FLIII fluorescent stereomicroscope with a
100 W mercury lamp, a 560/40 excitation filter, and a 610 long-pass
emission filter. Images were acquired using a Olympus DP70 digital camera
at 0.8 magnification and analyzed using Image Pro Plus 6.0 (MediaCybernetics). A single common threshold was applied to identify and measure
fluorescence in each organ (17). The number of fluorescent spots was
recorded for each lung lobe. All quantification was performed on
unmanipulated images.
Mice were obtained from an in-house breeding program and housed in
laminar-flow cage racks under standardized environmental conditions with
ad libitum access to food and water. All experiments were performed
according to the regulations of the Canadian Council on Animal Care.

Results
Inhibitors of L-PHA–induced cell death identified via a
high-throughput screen. Phytohemagglutinin is a tetravalent
plant lectin that binds and crosslinks complex N-glycoproteins on
cell surfaces and induces agglutination and cell death (18). To
identify compounds that alter N-glycan remodeling in malignant
cells, we developed, automated, and conducted a chemical screen
for inhibitors of L-PHA–induced cell death in Jurkat cells. In the
optimized assay, Jurkat cells were seeded in 96-well plates treated
with aliquots of the LOPAC (n = 1,280) library of off-patent drugs
and chemicals ( final concentration, f5 Amol/L and 0.05% DMSO).
Twenty-four hours after incubation, cells were treated with L-PHA
( final concentration, 20 Ag/mL), and 48 hours later, cell viability
was measured by the MTS assay (Fig. 2A). As controls, cells
received L-PHA or buffer alone. To identify molecules that inhibited
L-PHA–induced cell death, we used a statistically robust methodology. For each compound in the LOPAC library, we calculated a
Z score using the extensively replicated L-PHA control wells. These
Z scores were converted into P values using the standard normal
distribution. As we screened 1,280 distinct compounds, we then
applied a FDR correction for multiple hypothesis testing to the
vector of P values (11). Statistically significant hits were defined as
compounds with a q value (adjusted P value) of <0.05, indicating a
false-positive rate of at most 5%. Four statistically significant hits
were identified in this manner. Of the four statistically significant
hits, secondary screening validated one compound: the Na+/K+ATPase inhibitor dihydroouabain. This compound restored viability
of L-PHA–treated cells to 70% or over of untreated cells.
Other cardiac glycosides inhibit L-PHA–induced cell death.
Dihydroouabain belongs to the CG family of Na+/K+-ATPase
inhibitors, which are used clinically to treat patients with heart

failure and atrial arrhythmias (19). Moreover, CGs have potential
antitumor properties in patients (20, 21), but the mechanism by
which they exert this effect is unknown. To determine whether
the effects on N-glycan remodeling were specific to dihydrooua-

bain or a class-effect of CGs, we evaluated a panel of CGs for
inhibition of L-PHA–induced cell death. Jurkat cells were treated
with L-PHA along with increasing concentrations of digoxin,
digitoxigenin, digitoxin, and dihydroouabain, and cell viability

with aliquots of the LOPAC chemical library (final concentration, f5 Amol/L). Twenty four hours after treatment, L-PHA (final concentration, 20 Ag/mL) was added. Forty
eight hours after L-PHA addition, cell viability was measured by an MTS assay. Viability was expressed as a percentage of buffer treated control cells. Statistically
significant hits were selected as those with a q value of <5%. Four statistically significant hits were identified in this manner, which restored viability of L-PHA–treated cells
to 70% or over of untreated cells (dashed line ). B, Jurkat cells (5,000) were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with increasing concentrations of dihydroouabain,
digitoxigenin, digitoxin, and digoxin. Twenty four hours after treatment, L-PHA (final concentration, 20 Ag/mL) was added. Forty eight hours after L-PHA addition, cell
viability was measured by an MTS assay. Viability was expressed as a percentage of buffer treated control cells. Points, mean percent viable cells; bars, SD.

was measured by the MTS assay (Fig. 2B). All CGs tested blocked
L-PHA–induced cell death. The most potent CG tested was
digoxin that inhibited L-PHA–induced cell death with an EC50 of
60 F 20 nmol/L. This result is in keeping with digoxin being a
more potent inhibitor of the Na+/K+-ATPase than dihydroouabain
and digitoxigenin (22). In addition to inhibition of L-PHA–
induced cell death, CGs also blocked L-PHA–mediated agglutination of the Jurkat cells (data not shown). Of note, at higher
concentrations of the CGs or longer periods of incubation, the
CGs directly induced cell death, consistent with previous reports
(23, 24). Compared with the human isoform, CGs bind the a1
subunit of murine Na+/K+-ATPase with less affinity, thereby
rendering murine cells resistant to any effects of CGs that are
mediated through this ATPase (25, 26). Consistent with this
prediction, the tested CGs did not block L-PHA–induced cell
death nor agglutination of MDAY-D2 murine leukemia cells (data
not shown), suggesting that CGs inhibition of L-PHA toxicity to
Jurkat cells requires its known function as inhibitors of human
Na+/K+-ATPase.
Digoxin increases the levels of total and cell surface ConAbinding glycoproteins. To explore the effect of inhibiting the
Na+/K+-ATPase on the N-glycan profile of cancer cells, we

measured the effects of digoxin on levels of ConA-binding high
mannose and hybrid N-glycans. Jurkat cells were treated with
digoxin (100 nmol/L), the known Golgi a-mannosidase II inhibitor,
swainsonine (2 Amol/L; refs. 18, 27), or buffer control for 24 hours.
After treatment, the abundance of ConA-binding glycopeptides was
measured by the phenol-sulfuric acid method as described in the
Materials and Methods section. Digoxin and swainsonine increased
the abundance of ConA-binding glycopeptides 2.3- and 1.8-fold,
respectively, compared with controls (Fig. 3A).
To further explore the effects of Na+/K+-ATPase inhibition on
ConA-binding glycans and to evaluate the generalizability of this
finding, we measured the binding of ConA to the surface of a panel
of solid tumor cell lines. Colo320, 5637, HeLa, WRO, PPC-1, and
HT1080 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of digoxin
for 48 hours. After treatment, cells were fixed and stained with
TRITC-labeled ConA. The binding of fluorescently labeled ConA was
quantified by the Cellomics Array scan (Fig. 3B). Consistent with
modification of the N-glycan pathway, digoxin increased the
binding of ConA to the surfaces of all the cell lines studied.
To determine whether the effects of digoxin on the surface
expression of ConA-binding proteins were due to inhibition of its
known target Na+/K+-ATPase, we overexpressed in PPC1 human

NOTE: Jurkat cells (1  107) were treated with 100 nmol/L digoxin, 2 Amol/L Swainsonine, or buffer control for 24 h. After incubation, oligosaccharides
were isolated and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The ability of glycans to bind to ConA is based on previous studies using standard
N -glycans and ConA-Sepharose columns (38, 39). The data represent the normalized intensity of each oligosaccharide relative to
(Hexose)2(HexNAc)2(Deoxyhexose)1. Previous work from several groups (e.g., ref. 40) with mass spectrometry of N-glycans has shown that the m/z
values in this table correspond to structures in which Hexose is D-Mannose (M) or unidentified (probably D-Galactose), HexNAc is N-AcetylD-glucosamine (Gn), and Deoxyhexose is L-Fucose.

prostate cancer cells the a1 subunit of murine Na+/K+-ATPase that
is less sensitive to cardiac glycosides. Increased expression of the
Na+/K+-ATPase was confirmed by reverse-transcriptase real-time
PCR (data not shown). Overexpression of the a1 subunit of murine
Na+/K+-ATPase blocked the effects of digoxin and prevented the
increase in surface ConA staining (Fig. 3C). Likewise, we transfected PPC-1 cells with siRNA against the human Na+/K+-ATPase
and knockdown of the Na+/K+-ATPase was confirmed by Q-RTPCR
(data not shown). Compared with cells treated with control siRNA,
PPC-1 cells transfected with siRNA against the Na+/K+-ATPase
displayed increased ConA-binding proteins on the cell surface (Fig.
3D). Likewise, knockdown of the Na+/K+-ATPase with siRNA in
HeLa cells showed a similar effect on ConA surface–binding
proteins (data not shown). Thus, taken together, these results show
that inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase has a significant modifying
effect on the N-glycosylation pathway.
MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry shows an alteration of the
N-glycosylation pathway down stream of a-mannosidase II. To
identify the site in the N-glycan pathway blocked by Na+/K+ATPase inhibitors, Jurkat cells were treated with digoxin, the
known Golgi a-mannosidase II inhibitor swainsonine, or buffer
control. After treatment, the expression profile of intracellular
oligosaccharides was measured by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Table 1). Swainsonine increased the abundance of M9Gn2,
M8Gn2, M7Gn2, M6Gn2, and M5Gn2, which is consistent with a
block at Golgi a-mannosidase II and accumulation of these
precursors. In contrast, treatment with digoxin decreased the
abundance of these oligosaccharides but increased the levels of
Gn1M3Gn2F1 hybrid and Gn2M3Gn2F1 biantennary complex Nglycans. Slight increases in Gn3M3Gn2F1 triantennary and

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (16). August 15, 2008

Gn4M3Gn2F1 tetraantennary complex N-glycans were also seen.
These results suggest that inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase by
digoxin impairs the N-glycan pathway, thereby promoting the
accumulation of hybrid and biantennary complex N-glycans.
Digoxin therefore inhibits the N-glycan remodeling through a
mechanism distinct from swainsonine.
Digoxin decreases migration and invasion of malignant
cells. Increased GlcNAc branching of N-glycans on the cell surface
promotes the malignant and metastatic potential of cells by
altering cell migration and invasion (1, 28). As treatment with
digoxin altered the N-glycan remodeling, we evaluated the effects
of this compound on the N-glycosylation–mediated processes of
cell migration and invasion. To determine the effects on cell
migration, we evaluated the effect of digoxin in a scratch wound–
healing assay. HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells were treated with
digoxin or buffer control and seeded in fibronectin-coated 4-well
chamber slides. After adhering overnight, the cell monolayer was
scratched to create a wound. Migration of cells to heal the wound
was measured over time. Treatment with digoxin impaired cell
migration and delayed wound healing (Fig. 4A). Of note, at the
concentrations tested in these assays, digoxin-treated cells were
>90% viable as measured by the MTS assay. Furthermore, the
treated cells migrated sufficiently to completely heal the wound by
24 hours. Thus, the effects of digoxin on cell migration cannot be
attributed to simple reductions in cell viability.
To further evaluate the effects of digoxin on cell migration, WRO
human thyroid carcinoma cells were treated with digoxin, and
migration through uncoated invasion chambers with an 8-Am pore
size was measured (Fig. 4B). Again, digoxin inhibited cell migration
but did not reduce cell viability as measured by MTS assay.

Cardiac Glycosides Impair the N-Glycosylation Pathway

Finally, we assessed the effects of digoxin on cell invasion
(Fig. 4C). WRO cells were treated with digoxin and seeded into
Matrigel-containing invasion chambers in serum-free medium.
Medium with 5% FBS was placed in the lower chamber as a chemoattractant. Twenty four hours after seeding, cell invasion through the
Matrigel was measured. Digoxin treatment decreased cell invasion
but did not reduce cell viability as measured by the MTS assay.
Thus, taken together, concentrations of digoxin that blocked
N-glycan remodeling also inhibited the N-glycosylation–mediated
processes dependent on GlcNAc-branched N-glycans: cell migration and invasion. These results suggest that the effects of digoxin
on N-glycan expression are functionally important.
Digoxin decreases distant tumor formation in vivo. As
aberrant GlcNAc branching of N-glycans on the cell surface
promotes metastases, we tested the effects of digoxin on distant
tumor formation in mouse models of metastatic prostate cancer. In
the first model, dsRed-labeled PPC-1 cells were treated with digoxin
(100 nmol/L), or buffer control in culture. After 20 hours of treatment, cells were injected i.v. into sublethally irradiated SCID mice.
Three weeks after injection, mice were sacrificed and distant tumor
formation in the organs was imaged with fluorescent microscopy.
Invasion of the prostate cancer cells was detected in the lung,
bone, and liver, clinically relevant sites of metastases in prostate
cancer. In particular, metastasis of dsRed-PPC-1 cells to the lung
was readily quantifiable using image-based analysis (10, 17, 29, 30).
Compared with buffer control, mice injected with digoxin-treated
cells had decreased mean tumor number (142 F 71 tumors versus
20 F 19 tumors; P = 0.0004 by Student’s t test) within the lung
(Fig. 5A). Median tumor number was also significantly attenuated by
drug treatment (data not shown). It is important to note that both
treated and control cells were >90% viable at the time of injection. To
determine whether the decreased distant tumor formation was
simply due to decreased proliferation, DsRed-PPC-1 cells were
treated in culture with digoxin or buffer control and injected s.c. into
mice. In contrast to its effects on distant tumor formation, digoxin
did not significantly alter the growth of dsRedPPC-1 cells injected

s.c. compared with cells treated with buffer control (227 F 50 mg
versus 331 F 81 mg; P = 0.24 by Student’s t test; Fig. 5B). Therefore,
the reduction in tumor burden after digoxin treatment is not solely
due to reductions in cellular proliferation.
To further evaluate the effects of digoxin on distant tumor
formation, sublethaly irradiated SCID mice were injected i.v. with
dsRed-PPC-1 cells and then treated i.p. with digoxin (1.35 and
0.675 mg/kg) or buffer control daily for 14 days. Four weeks after
the injection of the cells, mice were sacrificed and analyzed as
above. Compared with buffer control, both concentrations of
digoxin decreased the mean number of tumors [48 F 32 tumors
(0.65 mg/kg) versus 28 F 19 tumors (1.35 mg/kg) versus 171 F 83
tumors (control)] in the lungs (Fig. 5C). Similar reductions in
median tumor number were also observed (data not shown). Thus,
taken together, digoxin inhibits distant tumor formation in vivo.

Discussion
To better understand the effect of modulating N-glycosylation in
malignant cells, we used a chemical biology screen for inhibitors of
L-PHA–induced cell death to identify novel regulators of glycosylation. From this screen, we identified the CG dihydroouabain and
determined that structurally related CGs also blocked L-PHA–
induced cell death. Of the tested CGs, digoxin was the most potent
inhibitor. These results, coupled with the lack of effect on murine
cells suggest that CGs alter N-glycosylation by inhibiting their
known target, the Na+/K+-ATPase. Further supporting a mechanism linked to the known binding target, overexpression of the
murine Na+/K+-ATPase that is less sensitive to CG inhibition
abrogated the effects of digoxin on surface ConA-binding
N-glycoproteins. Moreover, knockdown of the Na+/K+-ATPase
using siRNA recapitulated the effects of digoxin. Thus, taken
together, we conclude that inhibiting the Na+/K+-ATPase alters the
N-glycosylation pathway.
In this report, we used four independent approaches to show the
ability of CGs to modify the N-glycosylation pathway. First, L-PHA
induces cell death by binding primarily to cell surface N-glycans

Figure 5. Digoxin inhibits distant tumor formation in vivo. A, fluorescent dsRed-PPC-1 cells were treated with digoxin (100 nmol/L; n = 8) or buffer control (n = 7).
Twenty hours after treatment, cells were harvested and 3.5  106 viable cells were injected into the tail veins of sublethally irradiated SCID mice. Three weeks after
injection, mice were sacrificed and their organs were imaged using a fluorescent microscope. The numbers of distant tumors from all five lobes of the lungs were
quantified using image analysis software. Columns, mean number of tumors; bars, SD. P values are based on the Student’s t test. B, fluorescent dsRed-PPC-1
cells were treated with digoxin (100 nmol/L; n = 6) or buffer control (n = 5). Twenty hours after treatment, cells were harvested and injected s.c. into sublethally
irradiated SCID mice. Two weeks after injection, mice were sacrificed, and the tumors were excised and weighed. Columns, mean tumor weight; bars, SD. P values are
based on the Student’s t test. C, fluorescent dsRed-PPC-1 cells (3.5  106 viable cells) were injected into the tail veins of sublethally irradiated SCID mice.
Daily for 14 d, the mice were treated with digoxin [0.675 mg/kg/d (n = 9) or 1.35 mg/k/d (n = 9)] or buffer control (n = 5). Four weeks after injection, mice were sacrificed
and their organs were imaged using a fluorescent microscope. The number of distant tumors from all five lobes of the lungs were quantified using image analysis
software. Columns, mean number or area of tumors; bars, SD. P values are based on the Student’s t test.

that occur downstream of the GnTII in the N-glycan synthesis
pathway, and CGs blocked L-PHA–induced cell death. Second, CGs
increased total cellular ConA-binding glycoproteins. Third, CGs
increased cell surface ConA–binding N-glycoproteins. Finally, mass
spectrometry revealed that digoxin increased the ConA-binding
GnM3Gn2F1 hybrid and Gn2M3Gn2F1 biantennary N-glycans.
The profile of oligosaccharides after digoxin treatment indicates
that digoxin alters the N-glycosylation. These results also indicate
that digoxin alters the pathway through a mechanism distinct from
the a-mannosidase II inhibitor swainsonine.
In this report, we showed that digoxin inhibited cellular
migration and invasion, which are known functional consequence
of blocking the N-glycan branching. For example, Mgat5 / mice
have reduced cancer growth and metastasis (31). Likewise, siRNA
knockdown of GlcNAc-TV in malignant cells impairs cell migration
and invasion (28). Although digoxin’s inhibition of cell migration
and invasion are consistent with its effects on the N-glycan
remodeling, we cannot exclude that these effects are related to
other pathways effected by the molecule.
CGs can induce cell death in malignant cells (23, 24) through
multiple mechanisms including activation of Cdk5 (32), Src kinase
(33), and p21 (33). However, the effects of CG on N-glycan pathway
and cellular processes of migration and invasion were not artifacts
of cell death, as the concentrations of digoxin and times of
incubation required to alter N-glycan remodeling were lower than
those required to induce cell death. Furthermore, as the concentrations of CG required to alter the N-glycan pathway are lower than
the concentrations associated with activation of these other
pathways, we suspect that the effects of CG on N-glycosylation
are not related to activation of these other pathways.
Serum concentrations of 2 nmol/L digoxin can be achieved in
humans without significant toxicity (34). Although the concentration
of digoxin required to inhibit N-glycosylation exceeded 2 nmol/L,
potentially, chronic daily dosing of digoxin could sufficiently reduce
N-glycan branching to affect the function of downstream effectors.
Interestingly, patients with breast carcinoma who were coincidentally receiving CGs for cardiac dysfunction had a lower rate of
relapse and metastasis than patients not receiving CGs (20, 21). Our
results suggest that CGs could have an antitumor effect in patients
by altering the N-glycosylation profile in malignant cells. To assess
the effects of digoxin on distant tumor formation and mimic some
of the processes of metastasis, we tested digoxin in two mouse

models. In both of these models, digoxin decreased distant tumor
formation. Thus, the decreased metastases supports a mechanism
of action linked to the inhibition of glycosylation. Thus, digoxin
could be a lead for a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of
malignancy and an adjunct to prevent metastases. A limitation
to the xenograft studies, however, is that we cannot be certain
that digoxin prevented metastases through a mechanism related
to ability to inhibit glycosylation. Potentially inhibition of the
Na+/K+ATPase may have antitumor effects through mechanisms
distinct from impairing glycosylation.
Interestingly, other glycosylation inhibitors have entered clinical
trials for the treatment of malignancy. Swainsonine, a small
molecule inhibitor of Golgi a-mannosidase II, has anticancer activity
in preclinical models (27, 35). Given these results, swainsonine was
advanced into a phase I clinical trial for patients with refractory
malignancy. In the context of this trial, tumor regression was noted
in one patient with head and neck cancer (36, 37). Thus, inhibiting amannosidase II may be a clinically effective anticancer strategy and
inhibiting targets downstream of a-mannosidase II might also
produce antitumor effects without untoward toxicity.
In summary, we used a chemical biology approach to investigate
the Golgi N-glycan pathway. Our high-throughput screen identified
Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitors that altered the N-glycan branching at a
point distinct from the a-mannosidase II inhibitor. Na+/K+-ATPase
inhibitors also blocked the N-glycan–dependent processes of cell
migration and invasion of cancer cells as well as distant tumor
formation in mouse models. Thus, our results help explain
previously reported anticancer effects of these compounds and
highlight new strategies for the development of anticancer
therapies.
