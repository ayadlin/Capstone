Abstract
Bromodomain 4 (BRD4) is an epigenetic regulator that, when inhibited, has
anti-cancer effects. In this study, we investigated whether BRD4 could be a target
for treatment of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We show that BRD4 is overexpressed in HCC tissues. Suppression of BRD4, either by siRNA or using JQ1, a
pharmaceutical BRD4 inhibitor, reduced cell growth and induced apoptosis in HCC cell
lines while also slowing HCC xenograft tumor growth in mice. JQ1 treatment induced
G1 cell cycle arrest by repressing MYC expression, which led to the up-regulation of
CDKN1B (P27). JQ1 also de-repressed expression of the pro-apoptotic BCL2L11 (BIM).
Moreover, siRNA knockdown of BIM attenuated JQ1-triggered apoptosis in HCC cells,
suggesting an essential role for BIM in mediating JQ1 anti-HCC activity.

Introduction

JQ1 is a small molecule inhibitor of BET proteins
with high binding affinity for BRD4 [3]. JQ1 and BRD4
competitively bind to chromatin at gene enhancers, and
JQ1 suppresses the expression of oncogenic proteins such
as c-Myc [3-10]. Preclinical studies of JQ1 as a treatment
for hematological malignancies and solid tumors have
demonstrated its anti-cancer activity, largely through
the suppression of c-Myc [7-13]. HCC tumors express
high levels of c-Myc, and increased c-Myc expression
correlates with a more advanced and aggressive
phenotype; thus, inhibition of c-Myc has long been
proposed as a treatment of HCC [14-20]. In fact, a recent
study by Puissant and colleagues reported that several
HCC cell lines were sensitive to JQ1 [21].

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most
common solid tumors and a leading cause of cancerrelated death worldwide [1]. Bromodomain 4 (BRD4) is
a member of the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET)
family of proteins [2] which acts as a transcriptional coactivator by facilitating the recruitment of the positive
transcription elongation factor P-TEFb [3, 4]. Aberrant
BRD4 expression may promote tumorigenesis in multiple
myeloma (MM), leukemia and several types of solid
cancers via transcriptional activation of oncogenic drivers.
Accordingly, there has been much effort to target BRD4
using pharmaceutical inhibitors [3-10].

Results

In this study, we hypothesized that BRD4
inhibitors would act as anti-cancer agents in HCC via
c-Myc suppression. To test that idea, we investigated
the role of BRD4 in HCC and the anti-cancer effects of
BRD4 inhibitors in HCC. We found that BRD4 is overexpressed in HCC tissues and that inhibition of BRD4 by
JQ1 suppresses cell proliferation by blocking cell cycle
progression and inducing apoptosis in HCC cells.

BRD4 is over-expressed in HCC cells and tumor
tissues
We first evaluated BRD4 expression using
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining in tissue arrays
containing HCC tumors and corresponding adjacent
non-neoplastic liver tissues from 72 patients. Normal

loading control (left panels). The numbers of the transfected cells were measured daily by manual counting for a period of 6 days following
transfection (right panels).

human liver tissues from three healthy donors were used
as controls. BRD4 was weakly expressed in normal liver
tissues and highly expressed in both primary tumor and
adjacent liver tissues (Figure 1A). However, tumor tissues
were stained more intensely than the non-neoplastic liver
tissues (p < 0.01; Figure 1A, 1B and Figure S1A, S1B).
Western blots of 5 pairs of tumors/adjacent liver tissues
confirmed increased expression of BRD4 in HCC tumors
(Figure 1C). BRD4 expression in HCC tumor tissues
differed by and was positively correlated with American
Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) cancer stage, with

mean scores of 1.7 ± 0.2, 2.1 ± 0.1, 2.5 ± 0.1 and 2.6 ±
0.2 for stage I, II, III and IV samples, respectively (oneway ANOVA, p < 0.05, Spearman, p < 0.05; Figure S1A,
Figure S1B, and Table S1). In addition, HCC patients
with higher BRD4 expression had lower survival rates
than patients with lower BRD4 expression (log-rank test,
hazard ratio [HR] = 2.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] =
1.32 to 3.6, p < 0.001; Figure 1D). These results suggest
that BRD4 expression is increased with HCC disease
progression.

BRD4 expression stimulates HCC cell growth

time, particularly in Hep3B and HuH7 cells.
Next, we analyzed apoptotic-signaling pathways
with cell fractionation and western blotting. JQ1
activated caspase-3 and caspase-9 expression and induced
PARP cleavage as well as cytochrome c release into
the cytoplasm from mitochondria (Figure 3D and 3E).
Caspase-8 expression was not induced by JQ1 (data
not shown), indicating that the mitochondrial apoptosis
pathway, rather than the extrinsic pathway, mediates the
anti-cancer activity of JQ1 in HCC cells. To determine
whether caspase-9 was required for JQ1-induced
anticancer activity, HCCLM3 and Hep3B cell lines were
pre-treated with 50 μM Z-LEHD-FMK, a pharmacological
caspase-9 inhibitor for 1 h prior to the addition of JQ1
(2.5 μM) for 3 days (Figure S2). Inhibition of caspase-9
activity reduced JQ1 induction of cell death, suggesting
that the caspase-9 initiated mitochondrial apoptosis
pathway is essential for JQ1 activity in HCC cells.

To investigate the role of BRD4 in HCC cell
growth, using two different siRNAs we suppressed BRD4
expression in Hep3B and HCCLM3 cells and examined
cell proliferation. Western blots showed that, in both cell
lines, transfection of either siRNA for 24 h led to an almost
complete suppression of BRD4 activation compared with
a non-targeting control siRNA (siCON; Figure 1E and
1F). Cells transfected with siCON grew rapidly, whereas
cells transfected with BRD4 siRNA had inhibition of cell
growth, particularly 4 days post-transfection. These results
suggest that BRD4 is essential for HCC cell growth.

JQ1 reduces human HCC cell proliferation
Sensitivity to JQ1was evaluated across 7 HCC cell
lines by treating cells with serial dilutions of the drug for 5
days and then analyzing cell growth by MTT assays. JQ1
inhibited cell growth in a dose-dependent manner in all 7
HCC cell lines (Figure 2A). Hep3B and HCCLM3 were
the most sensitive cell lines with IC50 values of 0.08 and
0.14 µM, respectively (Figure 2A; right panel). Notably,
a 5-µM concentration of JQ1 was sufficient to completely
inhibit cell growth in these two lines; therefore, they were
chosen for subsequent experiments.
We next performed clonogenic assays to determine
the long-term anti-proliferative effects of JQ1. JQ1
treatment for 14 days inhibited clone formation in a dosedependent manner in both cell lines (Figure 2B). Low
doses of JQ1 (0.1 µM) reduced clone numbers, while 2.5
µM JQ1 led to an almost complete inhibition of clone
formation.
Finally, we examined the inhibitory effect of JQ1
in 5 primary HCC cells freshly isolated from surgically
resected tumor tissues. MTT assays revealed that JQ1
treatment for 5 days inhibited primary HCC cell growth in
all 5 cases (Figure 2C), with IC50 values observed between
0.05 and 0.5 µM. Together, our results demonstrate that
JQ1 reduces proliferation in human HCCs.

JQ1 represses MYC expression and increases p27
expression in HCC cells
Building on previous studies which suggested that
c-Myc is the critical mediator of JQ1’s anti-cancer effects,
we next used qRT-PCR and western blots to examine
whether JQ1 treatment inhibited c-Myc expression in
HCC cells. Indeed, JQ1 inhibited the expression of
MYC in a time-dependent fashion (Figure 4A). siRNA
knockdown of BRD4 also inhibited MYC transcription,
suggesting that JQ1 reduced MYC through inhibition of
BRD4 (Figure S3). To determine whether BRD4 binds
directly to the MYC gene, we performed a chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiment. BRD4 was
enriched at the MYC enhancer in both HCC cell lines,
but this association was reduced after 24 hours of JQ1
treatment (Figure 4B). These results suggest that JQ1
suppresses MYC transcription by reducing BRD4 binding
to the MYC enhancer. Western blots confirmed that
transcriptional repression of MYC by JQ1 led to time- and
concentration-dependent decreases in c-Myc protein levels
in both cell lines (Figure 4C and 4D).
Next, using siRNA to MYC in HCC cell lines we
assessed the effects of this inhibition on cell growth
(Figure 4E, 4F and Figure S4). MYC knockdown inhibited
HCC cell growth; however, the effect was weaker than
that triggered by JQ1treatment at 2.5 µM, suggesting that
JQ1 may have other functions besides inhibition of c-Myc.
Previous studies had reported that JQ1 altered p27 and p21
expression (22, 24); therefore, we investigated the effects
of JQ1 on the levels of p27 and p21 in HCC cell lines. We
found that JQ1 led to increased p27 expression, but had a
strong inhibitory effect on the expression of p21 in both
HCC cell lines (Figure 4C and Figure S5).

JQ1 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in
HCC cells
To investigate the mechanism underlying the antiproliferative effects of JQ1 in HCC cells, we analyzed cell
cycle distribution using flow cytometry. JQ1 treatment
for 48 h led to an increased percentage of HCC cells in
G1 phase arrest and a decrease in the percentage of cells
in S phase (Figure 3A and 3B). JQ1 treatment also led
to a substantial accumulation of HCC cells in sub-G1
phase (Figure 3C) and induced morphological changes
characteristic of apoptosis, such as shrinkage, rounding,
and floating. These changes became more prominent over

BIM is required for JQ1-induced anti-cancer
effects in HCC cells

Information). A heat map depicting the top 46 genes that
were altered post-JQ1 treatment revealed enrichment for
genes involved in the cell cycle and/or apoptosis (Figure
5A). As expected, MYC was among the genes inhibited
by JQ1 treatment. In addition, the pro-apoptotic gene
BCL2L11 (BIM) was increased more than 2-fold after acute
JQ1 treatment (Figure 5A and Supporting Information), a
finding that was confirmed by qRT-PCR. Peak levels of
BIM mRNA were observed after 6 h of JQ1 treatment and
were sustained for at least 48 h in both cell lines (Figure

To unravel the discrepancy in the severity of anticancer effects observed between HCC cells treated with
c-Myc siRNA or JQ1 (Figure 4E and 4F), we performed
RNA-Seq analysis in HCCLM3 cells treated with or
without 0.5 µM JQ1 for 4 h. Acute JQ1 treatment led to
changes in the expression of a large number of genes,
and the complete results are provided online (Supporting

5B). Western blots validated that de-repression of BIM
results in a dramatic increase in BIM protein levels in both
HCC cell lines (Figure 5C and 5D). siRNA knockdown of
BRD4 also increased BIM transcription, suggesting that
JQ1 enhances BIM expression through inhibition of BRD4
(Figure S3).
Because BIM is a potent pro-apoptotic BCL-2
protein that binds to and antagonizes several key antiapoptotic family members [25, 26], we hypothesized
that BIM is involved in JQ1-induced apoptosis. siRNA
knockdown of BIM reduced JQ1-induced cell death
by 50% in HCC cell lines (Figure 5E and Figure S6).
Moreover, BIM knockdown attenuated JQ1-induced
caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage (Figure 5F),

suggesting that BIM is required for JQ1-triggered
apoptosis in HCC cells.

JQ1 inhibits tumor growth in HCC mouse models
To investigate the anti-tumor effects of JQ1 in
vivo, we employed HCCLM3 and Hep3B HCC xenograft
models. HCC cells were injected subcutaneously into the
flanks of nude mice, and, after palpable xenograft tumors
were established, the mice were randomly assigned into
treatment or control groups. For the treatment groups, JQ1
was administered intra-peritoneally to mice twice daily at
50 mg/kg body weight for a total of 14 days. The average

tumor volumes in the JQ1-treated groups were smaller
than those in the vehicle groups on day 14 in both models
(Hep3B, p < 0.05, HCCLM3, p < 0.05; Figure 6A and
6B). Moreover, analysis by two-way ANOVA revealed
that JQ1 treatment delayed HCC xenograft growth in
the Hep3B model (p < 0.05; Figure 6C). Mice treated
with JQ1 showed no obvious signs of toxicity (based on
body weight, food and water intake, activity and general
examination) during treatment.
JQ1 treated and untreated tumor tissues from the
Hep3B xenograft model were analyzed by western blots

and IHC. Treatment with JQ1 at 50 mg/kg twice per day
for 3 days led to BIM accumulation, PARP cleavage, and
caspase-3 activation, suggesting the activation of apoptotic
signaling in tumor tissues (Figure 6D). JQ1 treatment also
inhibited c-Myc and Ki-67 expression in HCC tumor
tissues (Figure 6E). Together, these data suggest that JQ1
promotes anti-tumor activity in vivo by inhibiting cell
cycle regulators and activating pro-apoptotic signaling
pathways.

Discussion

model, Patel and colleagues showed that suppression of
BRD4 with either JQ1 or siRNA rapidly increases BIM
expression in MPNSTs cells and, similar to the results
presented here, BIM knockdown inhibits JQ1-induced
apoptosis [26]. In addition, Gallagher and colleagues
showed that BIM is required for the induction of apoptosis
by the BET protein inhibitor I-BET151 in melanoma cells
[25]. Together, these studies underscore the importance of
BIM in the induction of apoptosis resulting from BRD4
(BET) inhibition. As BRD4 regulates gene expression
through the recruitment of the P‑TEFb, it remains to be
determined how JQ1 inhibition of BRD4 de-represses
BIM expression. Moreover, because JQ1 also inhibits
BRD2, BRD3, and other BET family members, in the
future it will be important to test the extent to which BET
family members contribute to JQ1 anti-tumor activity in
HCC and other cancers [4, 32].
Our finding that BRD4 expression is elevated in
a fraction of adjacent non-tumor liver tissue, albeit to a
lesser extent than in tumor tissue, raises a potential concern
for the future clinical utility of BRD4 inhibitors in human
HCC, as improper drug use may cause liver damage. In
addition, although JQ1 stimulated anti-HCC activity in
vitro, treatment with JQ1 at 50 mg/kg twice daily in vivo
had only a modest effect on tumor growth, suggesting that
BRD4 inhibitors with increased bioavailability or potency
may be required for improved therapeutic responses [33].

In the present study, we found that BRD4 expression
was increased in HCC cell lines and tumor tissue and
correlated with HCC disease progression. Moreover, we
showed that suppression of BRD4 using siRNAs inhibited
HCC cell growth. These data suggest a role for BRD4 in
HCC development and survival and are in agreement with
recent results by Zhang et al, which showed that forced
expression of BRD4 promotes cell growth, while shRNAinduced suppression of BRD4 inhibits HCC cell growth
[23]. We further showed that JQ1 arrested cell cycle
progression at G1 phase, induced apoptosis, and inhibited
clonogenic survival and growth at low concentration
ranges in HCC cell lines and patient-derived primary HCC
cells. Finally, using mouse HCC xenograft tumor models,
we showed that 2 weeks of treatment with JQ1 inhibited
tumor growth by suppressing proliferation and inducing
apoptosis without severe toxicity. These data suggest that
inhibition of BRD4 with small molecule inhibitors such as
JQ1 represents a novel strategy for the treatment of HCC.
We also elucidated the mechanism by which JQ1
blocks cell cycle progression in HCC cells and observed
that JQ1 treatment increased p27 expression in HCC
cells. Because p27 represents a key downstream mediator
of c-Myc-induced regulation of cell proliferation [24,
27], our findings suggest that the JQ1-induced cell cycle
arrest may rely on a BRD4-c-Myc-p27 axis in HCC
cells. Surprisingly, we found that JQ1 treatment reduced
p21 levels in HCC cells, which is in contrast to previous
reports that JQ1 arrests the cell cycle at the G1 phase
by upregulation of p21 in non-small cell lung cancer,
glioblastoma, MM cells, and acute myeloid leukemia
cells [10, 11, 24-30]. It is also important to note that the
inhibitory effects of JQ1 on c-Myc transcription appeared
somewhat delayed in HCC cells compared with kinetics
previously observed in MM cells [22]. This suggests
regulation of gene transcription by BRD4 is cell typedependent
Our analysis of the mechanisms underlying
apoptosis revealed that the mitochondrial apoptosis
pathway is involved in JQ1-induced anti-HCC effects.
This conclusion is supported by western blot analysis,
which showed that JQ1 induces PARP cleavage, caspase-3
activation, and cytosolic cytochrome c release in HCC
cells. Mitochondrial apoptosis is promoted by the proapoptotic BCL-2 family of proteins [31]. In this study,
we unexpectedly observed that JQ1 treatment led to rapid
and dramatic BIM up-regulation at both the mRNA and
protein level in HCC cells. Moreover, our data show that
BIM suppression rescues HCC cells from JQ1-induced
apoptotic cell death, suggesting an essential role for BIM
in the anti-HCC effects of JQ1.
Recently, other groups have reported that BET
inhibition leads to upregulation of BIM. Using a malignant

relative to those of untreated control samples were plotted
as a function of drug concentration (log scale). Inhibition
of cell viability was measured by percentage of viable

Cell death, flow cytometry, and clonogenic assays
Cell death was quantified by microscopic
examination in trypan blue exclusion assays. Cell cycle
analysis was examined by propidium iodide (PI, 50 µg/
mL in PBS) and flow cytometry with a BD LSR II system
(BD Biosciences, Shanghai, China). For clonogenic
assays, 1,000 cells were seeded into 6-well dishes in 5
mL of medium, treated as indicated, and maintained for
14 days at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were then
washed with drug-free medium, stained with 0.01% (w/v)
crystal violet, and cell colonies (> 50 cells) were counted
at 14 days post-treatment. The assays were performed in
duplicate with at least three different repeats per treatment.

qRT-PCR

HCC cells were treated as indicated, collected,
washed with PBS and suspended in 5 volumes of chilled
buffer A (250 mM sucrose, 20 mM HEPES, 10 mM KCl,
1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DLdithiothreitol [DTT], 17 μg/mL phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride [PMSF], 8 μg/mL aprotinin and 2 μg/mL
leupeptin [pH 7.4]) on ice for 15 min. Cell fractionation
was performed using the homogenization method. Briefly,
cells were homogenized using an ice-cold cylinder cell
homogenizer (20-25 strokes). Homogenized cell lysates
were separated by centrifugation at 750 g for 10 min,
and the supernatants were further centrifuged at 10,000
g for 20 min. The remaining supernatant was used as the
cytosolic fraction and subjected to western blot analysis.

Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized using the
high capacity cDNA archive kit (Applied Biosystems).
The mRNA level of MYC was quantified by qRTPCR using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Applied Takara
Bio, Shanghai, China). The MYC primers were as
follows:
5′-TCTCCACTCACCAGCACAACTACG
and
3′-ATCTGCTTCAGGACCCT.
The
BIM
(BCL2L11)
primers
were
as
follows:
5’TAAGTTCTGAGTGTGACCGAGA-3’
and
3’GCTCTGTCTGTAGGGAGGTAGG-5’.
The CDKN1A (p21) primers were as follows:
5’GAGGCCGGGATGAGTTGGGAGGAG-3’,
3’-CAGCCGGCGTTTGGAGTGGTAGAA-5.
The CDKN1B (p27) primers were as follows:
5-CCGGTGGACCACGAAGAGT-3,
and
5-GCTCGCCTCTTCCATGTCTC-3. The GAPDH primers
were as follows: 5-TGCCTCCTGCACCACCAACT-3,
and 5- CGCCTGCTTCACCACCTTC-3. The PCR
conditions included an initial denaturation step of 95°C for
2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95°C for 10 s, 56°C for 20
s, and 72°C for 20 s, and a final elongation step of 72°C
for 10 min. Quantitation relative to the endogenous control
(GAPDH) was performed using the Applied Biosystems
7500 Fast System SDS software.

proteins in HCC cell lines. The siRNA transfections (50
pmol/L) were performed using Lipofectamine RNAiMax
transfection reagent (Invitrogen, Shanghai, China). Nonsilencing siRNAs (siCON) and validated BRD4 siRNAs
(siBRD4-1) were purchased from Qiagen. BRD4 siRNA
(siBRD4-2) (sc-43639) and BIM siRNA (siBim-1) (sc29802) were purchased from (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
the second BIM siRNA (siBim2) (6461) was purchased
from Cell Signaling Technology (Shanghai, China),
and c-Myc siRNA (siMYC) were purchased from (GE
Dharmacon, Shanghai, China).

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
A tissue microarray was obtained from Shanghai
Outdo Biotech Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Normal
liver tissue sections were obtained from the Pathology
Department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou
University with patient consent. Tumor tissues were
obtained from tumor-bearing mice treated with JQ1 or
vehicle control for 3 days. The antibodies used for IHC
were from the following companies: BRD4 (HPA015055)
from Sigma (Shanghai, China); c-MYC (AF3696) from
R&D systems (Shanghai, China); and Ki 67 (550609)
from BD Biosciences (Shanghai, China). IHC was
performed as described previously [6]. Briefly, the sections
were de-paraffinized by xylene, rehydrated in graded
concentrations of ethanol and boiled in antigen retrieval
buffer (Abcam, Shanghai, China) in a microwave oven
for 5 min. Slides of consecutive sections were incubated
with diluted antibodies at room temperature for 2 h. After
incubation, the slides were washed three times with PBS,
incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
antibody (Invitrogen, Shanghai, USA) at room temperature
for 30 min, followed by incubation of ABC (avidin-biotin
complex, Vectorlabs, Shanghai, China) for 30 min and
visualization by the addition of 3,3’-diaminobenzidine
tetrahydrochloride (DAB) reagent (Dako Diagnostics
(Shanghai) Co., Ltd.), with hematoxylin as the counter
stain. Images of stained slides were captured using a
standard light microscope.

Chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
ChIP experiments were conducted as described
previously (13). Briefly, prior to harvesting, sodium
butyrate (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the cell culture
medium to a final concentration of 20 mM and mixed
gently. The cells were then harvested by trypsinization
and cross-linked with 1% (v/v) formaldehyde for 10 min
at room temperature. The cross-linking reaction was
terminated by adding glycine to a final concentration of
125 mM for 5 min. Cells were then lysed with lysis buffer
(50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, protease
inhibitor cocktail and 20 mM sodium butyrate). The
chromatin was sheared by sonication to a DNA fragment
size of 200-600 bp and precipitated by centrifugation at
12 000 × g at 4°C for 10 min. For immunoprecipitations,
5 μg of BRD4 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology,
#13440) or of a rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Cell
Signaling Technology, #2729) control were incubated
overnight with the sheared DNA. The next day, 50 μL
of protein G Dynabeads (Life Technologies) were added
and incubated for 4 h at 4°C. The antibody/chromatin/
beads complexes were washed four times with RIPA
buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA,
1% Triton-X100, 0,1% SDS, 0,1% sodium-deoxycholate
and 140 mM NaCl) and once with TE buffer (10 mM TrisHCl, 10 mM EDTA). DNA was incubated with elution
buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM EDTA, 20 mM sodium
butyrate, 50 mM NaCl) containing 50 μg/mL proteinase
K at 68°C for 2 h. DNA was purified using the Qiagen
MinElute columns (Qiagen). For all reactions, 300 pg of
ChIP and input DNA were analyzed using qPCR with
the following primers (4, 5): MYC promoters (forward)
5’-TCACGTTTGCCATTACCGGTTC-’3 and (reverse)
5’-TTTCAGGTTGGCTGCA G A AGGT-3’. Promoters
for GAPDH: 5-TGCCTCCTGCACCACCAACT-3, and
5- CGCCTGCTTCACCACCTTC-3. were used to rule out
non-specific binding (Figure S7).

Animal studies
All experimental procedures were performed in
accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional
Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee of
Zhengzhou University. All animals received humane care
according to the criteria outlined in the “Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals Chinese Version”
(2006). HCC Hep3B and HCCLM3 cells (5 x 106
cells) suspended in 0.1 mL of Matrigel were implanted
subcutaneously into the flank of 5-week-old athymic nude
mice (Hunan Slack King of laboratory animals, Changsha,
China). Once tumors had reached a minimal volume of
100 mm3, the mice were randomly assigned to the control
or treated groups (nine to 10 mice per group). Tumorbearing mice were treated twice (BID) per day with JQ1,
50 mg/kg, i.p. or an equal amount vehicle as a control for

2 weeks. Tumor volumes were evaluated twice weekly
by measuring two perpendicular diameters with calipers.
Tumor volume (V) was calculated using the following
equation: V = (a2 x b), where a is the width of the tumor
(small diameter) and b the length (large diameter) in
millimeters. To investigate the mechanism of JQ1-induced
anti-tumor activity, tumor-bearing mice were treated twice
per day with JQ1, 50 mg/kg, i.p, or vehicle for 3 days.
Then, the mice were sacrificed, and tumor tissues were
harvested and either fixed in formalin for IHC staining
for c-MYC and Ki 67 or lysed and examined for PARP
cleavage and caspase-3 activation.
