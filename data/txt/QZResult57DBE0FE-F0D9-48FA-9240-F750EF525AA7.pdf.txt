BACKGROUND: Outcome of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk myelodysplastic
syndrome (MDS) with chromosome 5 and 7 abnormalities (excluding del 5[q]) has been poor, with <10% of
patients alive at 2 years. METHODS: The authors investigated whether treatment with hypomethylating
agents (5-azacytidine/decitabine) leads to an improved outcome. Between January 2004 and December
2007, 81 patients (37 [46%] with AML [20% blasts]; 44 [54%] with high-risk MDS) with chromosome 5
and 7 abnormalities were treated with hypomethylating agents as their initial therapy. These included 68
patients with complex (3) abnormalities and 13 with <3 aberrations. During the same period, 151 patients
(126 with AML, 25 with MDS) with chromosome 5 and 7 abnormalities (128 complex, 23 noncomplex) were
treated with intensive chemotherapy (including cytarabine-based regimens in 72% and other regimes in
28%). RESULTS: The median ages for the 2 groups were 66 years and 61 years, respectively (ranges, 37-85
years and 19-89 years). Thirty-three (41%) patients in the hypomethylating group achieved complete remission (CR) versus 53 (35%) in the chemotherapy group (P ¼ .395). With a median follow-up of 51 weeks
(range, 12-101 weeks) and 40 weeks (range, 5–128 weeks), 22 of 33 patients in the hypomethylating group
and 33 of 53 patients in the chemotherapy group had developed disease recurrence. The median CR duration was 45 weeks and 23 weeks, respectively (P ¼ .153). The overall survival was superior for the hypomethylating group compared with the chemotherapy group (P ¼ .019). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with
hypomethylating agents may be superior to chemotherapy in patients with chromosome 5 and 7 abnorC 2009 American Cancer Society.

AML and MDS and Chromosome Abnormalities/Ravandi et al

The importance of karyotype at diagnosis in predicting outcome in patients with acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is well
established.1-5 These studies have clearly demonstrated
that the outcome for patients with chromosome 5 and
7 abnormalities (including monosomy 5 and 7 [5,
7] and deletion of the long arm of these chromosomes [5q, 7q]) have an inferior leukemia-free survival and overall survival when traditional cytotoxic
chemotherapy, including combinations of cytarabine
and anthracyclines, are used.2-4 Such inferior outcome
is also noted even with the use of allogeneic stem cell
transplantation in first complete remission.5 Other
studies have shown that the prognosis of patients with
refractory anemia with excess blasts or refractory anemia with excess blast in transformation with chromosome 5 and 7 abnormalities who are given AML-type
chemotherapy is the same as that for patients with
AML and these cytogenetic abnormalities.6 Therefore,
new strategies are needed for these patients.
The use of the hypomethylating agents 5-azacytidine
and 20 -deoxyazacitidine (decitabine) has been clearly associated with an improved outcome in patients with MDS.
These agents are now approved for use in this indication.7,8
Treatment with 5-azacytidine was shown to be superior to
conventional care strategies including traditional AML-type
chemotherapy in 358 patients with MDS.9 Of interest,
patients with 20% blasts (diagnosed as AML per the
World Heath Organization [WHO]) treated with hypomethylating agents in these trials had favorable responses, raising the possibility that these agents may be beneficial in
patients with AML, particularly those who are unable to
tolerate traditional chemotherapy.8-10
In this study, we examined whether the use of the
hypomethylating agents 5-azacytidine and decitabine was
associated with a better outcome than traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens in patients with AML and
high-risk MDS, who are typically resistant to the latter.

[intermediate-2 and high-risk per the International Prognostic Scoring System]) with chromosome 5 and 7 abnormalities were treated with hypomethylating agents as their
initial therapy. These included 68 patients with complex
abnormalities (3 abnormalities) and 13 with <3 aberrations. During the same period, 151 patients (126 AML,
25 MDS) with chromosome 5 and 7 abnormalities (128
complex, 23 noncomplex) were treated with intensive
cytotoxic chemotherapy (Table 1).10,12-23 All patients
were treated in clinical trials conducted in the department
during that period; all signed an institutional review
board-approved consent form to participate in these studies. The median age for the 2 groups was 66 years and 61
years, respectively (ranges, 37-85 years and 19-89 years).
Patients with advanced age in the chemotherapy group
received single-agent clofarabine or similar treatments.
Overall, 52 (22%) patients were considered as having de
novo disease, whereas 88 (38%) and 92 (40%) had therapy-related disease or a history of antecedent hematologic
disorder, respectively. Other patient characteristics are
shown in Table 2.

more patients in the chemotherapy group had AML.
However, a higher proportion of the hypomethylating
group had secondary or therapy-related AML or MDS (P
¼ .025). Furthermore, the proportion of patients with
better prognosis 5 and 7 disease as described by Estey et al
was similar in the 2 cohorts (16% vs 23%) (Table 2).11

Definitions
Cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow specimens was performed at the institutional cytogenetics laboratory using
standard criteria. The recommendations of the International System for Human Cytogenetics Nomenclature
were used to describe a cytogenetic clone. At least 3 metaphases with the specific cytogenetic abnormality were
needed to include the patient in the study. Patients with
5q as the sole abnormality were not included in this
study because of their expected favorable prognosis.
Patients with an additional favorable abnormality such as
t(8;21) or inv(16) are considered to have the better prognosis associated with the favorable abnormality, and were
not included in this study.

Treatment Regimens
The details of the regimens have been previously published (Table 1).10,12–23 Three and 56 patients were
treated with 5-azacytidine and decitabine alone, respectively. Twenty-two (11 each) patients received either
5-azacytidine or decitabine in combination with another
agent, typically a histone deacetylase inhibitor such as
valproic acid or vorinostat.
In the chemotherapy group, 66 patients received a
combination of high-dose cytarabine and idarubicin, 20
patients had cytarabine plus another agent, 48 patients
had clofarabine-based regimens, and 17 patients had other
miscellaneous regimens. The various treatment categories
administered and the responses to them are summarized
in Table 3.
Statistical Analysis
Survival curves were plotted by the Kaplan-Meier method
and compared using the log-rank test. Differences in subgroups by different covariates were evaluated using the
chi-square test for nominal values, and the MannWhitney U test for continuous variables.

RESULTS
Two hundred thirty-two patients were included in the
analysis. These included 81 (35%) patients who received
hypomethylating agents as their initial induction regimen,
and 151 (65%) patients treated with various chemotherapy regimens. Thirty-three (41%) patients in the hypomethylating group achieved complete remission (CR)
versus 53 (35%) patients in the chemotherapy group (P ¼
.395). Two (2%) and 15 (10%) patients in each group
achieved a CR without platelet recovery. The corresponding numbers of patients with primary resistant disease for
the hypomethylating and chemotherapy strategies were
31 (38%) and 57 (38%), respectively. Similarly, 14
(17%) patients in the hypomethylating cohort and 25
(17%) patients in the chemotherapy group died in the
first 4 weeks of treatment (Table 3). With a median follow-up of 51 weeks (range, 12-101 weeks) and 40 weeks
(range, 5–128 weeks), 22 of 33 (66%) patients in the
hypomethylating group and 33 of 53 (62%) patients in
the chemotherapy group had developed disease recurrence. The median CR duration was 45 weeks for the
hypomethylating group and 23 weeks for the chemotherapy group (P ¼ .153) (Fig. 1). The overall survival was
superior for the hypomethylating group compared with
the chemotherapy group (P ¼ .019) (Fig. 2). The median
survival was similar when comparing patients with AML
who received hypomethylating agents with those who
received chemotherapy (21 weeks vs 24 weeks, respectively; P ¼ .4). Similarly, the median survival for patients
with MDS treated by the 2 strategies was 46 weeks and 19

weeks (P ¼ .11). The median survival was significantly
longer for patients with lower presenting WBC count
when treated with hypomethylating agents as compared
with chemotherapy (192 weeks vs 40 weeks, respectively,
for patients with WBC count <10  109/L; P ¼ .017).

DISCUSSION
Patients with AML and high-risk MDS with chromosome 5 and 7 abnormalities have a poor prognosis.
Estey et al demonstrated that it is possible to identify
subgroups of patients with slightly better outcome.11

abnormalities, those with detectable normal metaphases
in addition to the abnormal clone and those with no
antecedent hematologic disorder had significantly better
survival. Patients with simple or complex abnormalities
had similar CR rates, but disease-free survival in CR
was significantly better for those with simple chromosome 5 and 7 abnormalities. Both CR rates and disease-free survival in CR were better for patients
without antecedent hematologic disorder and those
with detectable normal metaphases. They were able to
identify a subgroup, with simple abnormality, no antecedent hematological disorder, and detectable normal
metaphases that had significantly better survival than
all other patients with chromosome 5 and 7 abnormalities, which was comparable to patients with normal
cytogenetics treated during the same period.
The poor outcome of patients with chromosome
5 and 7 abnormalities is likely because of inherent resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Although CR
rates, particularly in patients with noncomplex disease,
can approach those noted in patients with intermediate-risk disease, the majority of patients with these
abnormalities rapidly develop disease recurrence. It is
likely that the small proportion of patients with a better prognosis as described above have fewer cellular
abnormalities, rendering them more sensitive to cytotoxic agents. However, it is clear that alternative treatment strategies are needed for this subgroup of
patients with AML and MDS. Alternative agents such
as clofarabine with or without low-dose subcutaneous
5750

cytarabine are being evaluated in older patients with
AML, who comprise a significant proportion of these
patients.12
Although our data are not indicative of a better
response to hypomethylating agents, the significantly better survival is suggestive of superiority of these drugs in
treating these patients. It is important to note that the 2
groups were not matched. However, the cohort treated
with hypomethylating agents had a higher median age
and larger proportion of patients with secondary or therapy-related AML/MDS, both of which are expected to
adversely affect the outcome. When examining the AML
and MDS groups separately, there was no significant difference in the outcome using the 2 strategies within each
group. However, there was a significantly better outcome
for hypomethylating therapy for patients with a presenting WBC count <10  109/L. This was also true for
other cutoff values, including the median and the 75%
value of presenting WBC count. This may be a reflection
of the time required to achieve a response using the hypomethylating agents (typically several courses or months)
and the lower efficacy of these agents in patients with proliferative disease.
It is possible that the better outcome with hypomethylating agents is at least partly attributable to the lower
toxicity and potentially less early mortality in this population of typically older patients, who are less able to tolerate
cytotoxic agents. However, such improvement based on
reduced early mortality would only be realized if hypomethylating therapy had at least a similar efficacy to cytotoxic
agents. Prospective studies are necessary to clearly demonstrate whether this strategy is truly superior to chemotherapy-based regimens in this subset of patients and to
evaluate whether such non–cross-resistant approaches to
cytotoxic chemotherapy combined with hypomethylating
agents used simultaneously or sequentially would further
improve the clinical outcome.
