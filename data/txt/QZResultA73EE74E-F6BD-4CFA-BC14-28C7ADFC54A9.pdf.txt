Abstract
MicroRNAs (miRNA) are endogenously expressed noncoding RNAs with important biological and pathological functions that are yet to be fully defined. This study investigated alterations in miRNA expression in head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the incidence of which is rising throughout the world. Initial screening
and subsequent analysis identified a panel of aberrantly expressed miRNAs in HNSCC tissues, with miR-31
among the most markedly upregulated. Ectopic expression of miR-31 increased the oncogenic potential of
HNSCC cells under normoxic conditions in cell culture or tumor xenografts. Conversely, blocking miR-31 expression reduced the growth of tumor xenografts. The in silico analysis suggested that miR-31 may target the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of factor-inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor (FIH), a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)
regulatory factor that inhibits the ability of HIF to act as a transcriptional regulator under normoxic conditions.
In support of this likelihood, miR-31 expression repressed FIH expression and mutations within the predictive
miR-31 target site in the FIH 3′ UTR abrogated FIH repression. Furthermore, miR-31 expression increased HIF
transactivation activity. We found that FIH suppressed oncogenic phenotypes under normoxic conditions and
that this activity was abrogated by functional mutations. Lastly, increased miR-31 expression was correlated with
decreased levels of FIH in tumor tissues. Our findings suggest that miR-31 contributes to the development of
HNSCC by impeding FIH to activate HIF under normoxic conditions. Cancer Res; 70(4); 1635–44. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the
fifth most common carcinoma worldwide (1, 2). MicroRNAs
(miRNA) are 19 to 24 nucleotides noncoding RNAs that regulate the translation and degradation of target mRNAs (3, 4).
Lines of evidence indicate that miRNA may play important
roles in carcinogenesis (5). The abundance of miRNAs and
their apparent pluripotent actions suggest that the identification of miRNAs involved in oncogenesis might yield targets or
networks that are suitable for therapeutic intervention (3).

miR-21 was found to be oncogenic in HNSCC (6–8). miR-98
regulates HMGA2 expression in HNSCC cells (9). An association has also been identified between miR-211 expression and
the vascular invasion of oral carcinoma (10). miRNA expression can also be used as a diagnostic marker of HNSCC (7, 11).
Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and HIF-2α are key
transcription factors induced by hypoxia, which activate a
transcription program that promotes aggressive tumor phenotypes by triggering the expression of critical genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), TWIST
transcription factor, and others (12, 13). When sensing the
oxygen tension, asparagine hydroxylation by factor-inhibiting
HIF-1α (FIH) inactivates the COOH terminal transactivation
domain (C-TAD) region of HIF-1α (14, 15). VEGF is one of
the hypoxia-inducible C-TAD–regulated genes (12). FIH is
a dioxygenase (14); mutations disrupting the oxygen sensing
or the dimerization of FIH molecule resulted in FIH inactivation (16, 17). FIH also modulates other elements and drives
diverse phenotypic effects (14, 15). Although FIH expression
is associated with neoplastic progression (18–20), the functional role of FIH in tumorigenesis has been obscure.
miR-31 was upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC), colorectal carcinoma (CRC), breast carcinoma, and
tongue carcinoma (7, 21–24). However, downregulation of
miR-31 or deletion of 9p21 locus harboring pri-miR-31 was
also found in malignancies (25, 26). A recent study showed
the upregulation of miR-31 in metastasis-free breast carcinoma and miR-31 drives inhibitory effects on breast cancer metastasis by targeting multiple genes (27). In this study, we

identified that miR-31 transactivated HIF in normoxia and
enhanced the oncogenesis of HNSCC via FIH, which acts as
a target.

Materials and Methods
HNSCC tissues. Resected tissues from 46 HNSCC patients
(Supplementary Table S1), who gave informed consent for
the use of their tissue, were harvested at surgery. The study
was approved by the institutional review board. Tissue specimens were taken from primary HNSCC, along with paired
noncancerous matched tissues (NCMT) as well as available
neck metastatic lesions (NML). Ten primary tumor tissues
were microscopically screened to have >70% of their areas
occupied by tumor cells; these were used to analyze a panel
of 154 highly conserved miRNAs using quantitative reverse
transcription–PCR (qRT-PCR) array (Applied Biosystems).
The results of this assay allowed the selection of particular
miRNAs to be assessed in tissues retrieved by laser capture
microdissection (LCM; ref. 1).
Quantitative PCR. A mirVana PARIS kit (Ambion) was
used to isolate miRNA from the total RNA. A Taqman miRNA
assay kit and Taqman miRNA assay supplies were used to
quantify the expression of mature miRNAs according to the
manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). miRNAspecific qRT-PCR was done in duplicate or triplicate on the
ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detector system (Applied Biosystems) using RNU19 or let-7a as internal controls (28). Ct
was the number of cycle at which the fluorescence signal
passed threshold. ΔCt was the difference of Ct values between
tested miRNA and internal control (10). ΔΔCt was the difference of ΔCt values between different experimental settings or
paired samples. 2ΔΔCt represents the fold change in miRNA
expression. mRNA expression of FIH, ING4, and PHD4 was analyzed using Taqman qRT-PCR analysis (Applied Biosystems).
Cell culture, reagents, and phenotypic assays. The
HNSCC cell lines Fadu, OECM-1, and SAS cells; HT29 CRC
cells; and 293FT and phoenix package cells were cultured
as previously described (2, 29), as were normal human oral
keratinocytes (NHOK), which were used as controls (30).
Fadu and SAS were tumorigenic, whereas OECM-1 was nontumorigenic in nude mice (31). For hypoxia culture, cells
were grown in an incubator (Astec) with 1% O2, 5% CO2,
and 94% N2 for 24 h. miR-31 antisense locked nucleic acid
(2′-O,4′-C-methylene-linked ribonucleotide derivative; LNA)
together with control scramble LNA were purchased from
Ambion. The inhibitory efficacy of miR-31 LNA in cultivated
SAS cells was validated as 120 nmol/L for 24 to 72 h. The
dose of miR-21 mimic (Ambion) was determined as 30
nmol/L by pilot studies. VEGF production in aliquots of cell
supernatant or tissue lysate was analyzed using a kit (Invitrogen). Analysis of cell viability, proliferation, migration, and
anchorage-independent colony formation followed the protocols previously published (2).
Plasmids, transfection, and infection. For exogenous
miR-31 expression, pre-mir-31 sequence was cloned into a
lentivirus vector, pLV-EF1a-GFP, which contains a green
fluorescent protein (GFP) tag (10). An empty vector or a vec-

1636

tor carrying the miR-31 insert was cotransfected with helper
plasmids into 293FT cells to produce lentiviruses. The stable
cell lines were established by lentiviral infection.
To test the targeting activity of miR-31, antisense sequences complementary to miR-31 sequences and the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of FIH containing predictive miR-31
target sites were cloned into the pCMV-LacZ plasmid at the
3′-end of the lacZ coding sequence; these reporter plasmids
were designated miR-31-asR and pCMV-LacZ-FIH3′UTR, respectively. Cotransfection of reporter plasmids with pCMVLuc into cells was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life
Technologies). LacZ gene expression would be repressed if
the pre-mir-31 insert was expressed, processed, and served
as small interfering RNA against lacZ. Two putative miR-31
target sites residing at nucleotides 117 to 124 and 774 to
780 in the FIH3′UTR predicted by TargetScan7 and Pictar8
were designated A and B as conservative and nonconservative sites, respectively. Mutant reporter plasmids were obtained from pCMV-LacZ-FIH3′UTR using a site-directed
mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). After confirmation of the replacement of the target sequence UCUUGC by AAGCUU, the
plasmids were designated A Mut, B Mut, and AB Mut, which
had mutations in A, mutations in B, and double mutations in
both A and B sites, respectively.
pHIF1-luc reporter plasmid (Panomics) was used for the
assay of HIF transactivation.
For exogenous FIH expression, two wild-type and two mutant FIH cDNA sequences generated by site-directed mutagenesis were cloned into pBabe-puro vector to produce
retroviruses for infection. The stable cells FIH(3′UTR),
FIHWt, FIHD201A, and FIH 1-302 cells were established by
puromycin selection after retroviral infection. FIH(3′UTR)
cells would express wild-type full-length FIH cDNA, including
3′ UTR, whereas FIHWt would express wild-type FIH coding
sequence without 3′ UTR. FIH is a dioxygenase, and its activity is Fe(II) dependent (14). FIH D201A cells would express a
mutant FIH coding sequence encompassing an aspartic acidto-alanine mutation at residue 201 that disrupts Fe (II) binding and attenuates catalytic activity. FIH 1-302 cells would
express a protein with truncation of 303 to 349 residues that
prevents the dimerization of FIH molecules at COOH terminal region and attenuates FIH (16, 17). Vector alone is a control cell infected with control virus.
Western blot analysis. Cell lysate (80 μg), cytosolic fraction (80 μg), and nuclear extract (40 μg) were isolated using
previously described protocols (27). Western blot analysis
followed previously used protocols (2). The providers and
dilution of the primary antibodies are presented in Supplementary Table S2.
Immunohistochemistry. FIH and VEGF immunoreactivities in HNSCC, together with available NCMT and NML,
were detected by immunohistochemistry following previously reported protocols (1). Incubation of primary antibodies

was at 4°C overnight (Supplementary Table S2). Preimmunized mouse IgG was used as a negative control. The immunoreactivity was scored −, +, and ++ when <10%, 10% to 50%,
and >50% immunoreactive cells were counted, respectively,
in five randomly selected 200× fields.
Tumorigenesis. The analysis of tumorigenesis followed the
previously published protocols (10). For blockage of xenographic tumors, 0.5% atelocollagen (Koken Co.) on pepsin
treatment to remove antigenecity was complexed with
2.5 μmol/L miR-31 LNA and equivalent scramble controls in
a volume of 200 μL. When SAS xenografts grow to ∼0.2 cm3,
the complexes were injected s.c. to the periphery of tumors (31).
Statistical and bioinformatics analysis. Pair-wise analysis was performed using website-accessible Generalized Association Plots (GAP) program.9 Mann-Whitney test and
Fisher's exact test were used to compare the differences
among variants. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
analysis was performed, and the area under curve was used
as a measurement for the level of separation between clinical
settings. The leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) model
was used to compute the accuracy of assays. A P value of
<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
Upregulation of miR-31 in HNSCC. The miRNA expression profile of HNSCC was achieved from 10 screened tumors
analyzed with qRT-PCR array (Supplementary Table S3).
miRNAs having concordant ΔΔCt of >0 or <0 across at least
seven screened tumors relative to their paired NCMT were
selected for further stratification. The average ΔΔCt was >1
for 22 miRNAs and <−1 for 9 miRNAs. These miRNAs
were therefore considered aberrant in the HNSCC samples
(Fig. 1A). Six tumors had high correlation in the miRNA aberration. The highest overexpression was found for miR-31, and
miR-21 was also markedly upregulated. GAP analysis showed
a strong correlation between expression of miR-31 and miR21, miR-34b and miR-34c, and miR-99a and miR-100 (Fig. 1B).
Analysis of the 46 LCM-retrieved samples confirmed that
there was an increase in miR-21, miR-31, and miR-371 in
89%, 84%, and 70% HNSCC relative to NCMT, respectively
(Fig. 1C). miR-31 was confirmed to be shown the greatest level
of overexpression in HNSCC, with a mean ΔΔCt of 3.64. ROC
and LOOCV analyses indicated the analytic power (0.82) and
accuracy (0.72) using miR-31 expression to dissect NCMT
from HNSCC (Fig. 1D). The analytic power was better than
that shown by miR-21 expression or miR-371 expression (Supplementary Fig. S1). No significant association was identified
between miR-31 expression and clinical parameters.
miR-31 expression increased the oncogenic potential of
HNSCC cells. HNSCC cells had higher miR-31 expression relative to NHOK (Supplementary Fig. S2). Blockage of miR-31
expression with miR-31 LNA treatment significantly decreased viability and migration of SAS cells (Fig. 2A). HNSCC
cells were infected with lentivirus carrying miR-31. The de-

tection of green fluorescence in SAS cells measured infectivity successfully (Fig. 2B, left). SAS-miR-31 cells exhibited
upregulation of miR-31 expression by 32-fold relative to
SAS-GFP control cells. There was also a remarkable Lac Z
repression in SAS-miR-31 cells when transfected with the reporter plasmids miR-31-asR (Fig. 2B, right). This suggests the
presence of targeting activity in exogenous miR-31. SAS-miR31 had significantly greater proliferation, migration, and
anchorage-independent growth than controls (Fig. 2C).
SAS-miR-31 also showed significantly greater xenographic tumor growth than controls in nude mice (Fig. 2D, left). With
the treatment of miR-31 LNA and atelocollagen mixture (32),
the tumorigenic potential of SAS cells was attenuated
(Fig. 2D, right).
OECM-1-miR-31 cells exhibited green fluorescence; upregulation of miR-31 expression for 10-fold; miR-31 targeting
activity; and increased proliferation, migration, and anchorage-independent growth than OECM-1-GFP control cells.
OECM-1-miR-31 cells exhibited a slight increase in tumorigenicity; however, the difference was not statistically significant
(Supplementary Fig. S3A–F). Fadu-miR-31 cells exhibited a
drastically higher tumorigenicity than Fadu-GFP control
cells. Blood vessels with a greater diameter were present in
Fadu-miR-31 xenografts than in the controls (Supplementary
Fig. S4).
miR-31 targets FIH. TargetScan and/or Pictar systems
predicted hypoxia-associated genes FIH, HIF-3α, ING4, and
PHD4, to be putative targets of miR-31. Downregulation of
FIH mRNA expression and protein expression was found in
SAS-miR-31 cells compared with controls. Conversely, upregulation of FIH mRNA expression and protein by ∼50%
on miR-31 LNA treatment relative to controls was found
(Fig. 3A). Preliminary assays excluded HIF-3α, ING4, and
PHD4 as miR-31 targets (Supplementary Fig. S5). To prove
the repression of FIH by miR-31, the pCMV-LacZ-FIH3′UTR
reporter was used. LacZ activity was repressed more in SASmiR-31 than in controls; however, the repression reverted on
treatment with miR-31 LNA (Fig. 3B). Conservative and nonconservative predicted targets for miR-31 in the 3′ UTR of
FIH was designated as the A site and the B site, respectively.
The mutant reporter plasmids A Mut, B Mut, and AB Mut
were generated. In SAS-miR-31 cells, the A site mutation resulted in a considerable reversion of the Lac Z repression
compared with the B site mutation (Fig. 3C). Mutations in
both A and B sites resulted in a complete reversion of LacZ
repression. These findings suggest that the binding of miR-31
to the conservative site in 3′ UTR may repress FIH expression. For exogenous FIH expression, SAS-miR-31 cells and
SAS-GFP cells were further infected with retroviruses to
achieve FIH(3′UTR) and FIHWt subclones. The former expressed FIH coding sequence together with 3′ UTR, and
the latter expressed only FIH coding sequence. These subclones exhibited an increase in FIH expression relative to
control subclones (Fig. 3D, top). The FIH expression in FIH
(3′UTR) and FIHWt subclones from SAS-miR-31 cells was
lower than corresponding subclones from SAS-GFP cells.
Similar changes were also present in OECM-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3H). Furthermore, FIH expression is higher in

These findings validated the presence of a miR-31 target in
the 3′UTR of FIH. Sequence complimentarity was found between miR-21 and FIH 3′ UTR using RNA2210 program. The
treatment with miR-21 mimic upregulated miR-21 expression
and slightly repressed the FIH expression in SAS and OECM1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S6).
FIH expression decreased the oncogenic potential of
HNSCC cells in normoxia. Exogenous FIH expression was
associated with decreased proliferation, migration, and
anchorage-independent colony formation of SAS-GFP cells
under normoxia culture conditions, but not in hypoxia culture (Fig. 4A). Exogenous FIH expression and hypoxia culture

had only limited influence on the growth, but exogenous
FIH expression significantly decreased migration and anchorage-independent colony formation of OECM-1-GFP cells
in normoxia culture (Supplementary Fig. S3I–K). In hypoxic
culture, the suppressive function of FIH(3′UTR) was remarkably attenuated. Because FIH function seemed inactivated in
the hypoxia state, FIH D201A mutant subcone and FIH 1-302
truncaton subclone were established in SAS cells to insight
the effects of FIH activity in normoxia (16, 17). The expression of the exogenous mutant FIH and the truncated FIH was
shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4B). The suppressive
effect of wild-type FIH on anchorage-independent growth
(Fig. 4C) and tumorigenesis (Fig. 4D) was significantly reversed by the mutation or the truncation. Thus, FIH activity
is suppressive to SAS cells in normoxia.
miR-31 transactivated HIF activity in normoxia. Under

controls (Fig. 5A, top). SAS-GFP cells carrying exogenous FIH
variants also had similar levels of HIF-1α and HIF-2α expression. SAS-miR-31 had higher HIF transactivation activity than
controls, and this could be decreased by miR-31 LNA (Fig. 5A,
bottom). The expression of HIF-1α and transactivation of
HIF activity in SAS-miR-31 and controls were induced under
hypoxia culture (Fig. 5B, top); however, exogenous miR-31 expression had no effect on HIF activation in hypoxia (Fig. 5B,
bottom). In normoxia, SAS-miR-31 showed higher proliferation, migration, and anchorage-independent growth than
controls, but this was not the case in hypoxia culture (Fig.
5C, a–c). VEGF production in SAS-miR-31 was higher than
in the controls during normoxia, but VEGF production in
SAS-miR-31 and the controls were similar under hypoxia
(Fig. 5C, d). VEGF production in OECM-1-miR-31 was also
higher than control cells during normoxia (Supplementary
Fig. S2G). SAS-miR-31 xenografts showed higher VEGF production than SAS-GFP tumors, whereas SAS xenografts
carrying exogenous FIH expression showed lower VEGF production (Fig. 5D).

Exogenous miR-31 expression decreased both cytosolic
and nuclear FIH in SAS cells. Exogenous FIH expression
resulted in a greater increase in cytosolic FIH compared
with nuclear FIH; and exogenous miR-31 expression
seemed to decrease nuclear FIH more remarkably than cytosolic FIH in SAS cells (Supplementary Fig. S7). Exogenous miR-31 decreased FIH expression and exogenous
FIH increased FIH expression in SAS xenografs (Supplementary Fig. S8).

neck carcinogenesis. FIH immunoreactivity was detected
in the lower half of the epithelium in NCMT. This displayed

and B, a, b). In tissue pairs available for comparison, the
FIH immunoreactivity was remarkably attenuated in the
NML in relation to their HNSCC counterparts (Fig. 6B, b,

samples were scored as having nuclear FIH immunoreactivity in >10% cells. A statistically significant decrease in nuclear
FIH from NCMT samples to HNSCC samples was noted (Supplementary Table S4). A reverse association lying between
miR-31 expression and nuclear FIH immunoreactivity was also noted in HNSCC (Supplementary Table S5).
There was 18% NCMT (Fig. 6C, a) and >60% HNSCC
(Fig. 6C, b) or NML (Fig. 6C, c) having cytosolic VEGF immunoreactivity in >50% cells. A statistically significant increase of VEGF immunoreactivity from NCMT to HNSCC
was noted (Supplementary Table S6). A trend for reverse
association lying between nuclear FIH immunoreactivity
and VEGF immunoreactivity was found in HNSCC samples.
A reverse association lying between nuclear FIH immunoreactivity and VEGF immunoreactivity was noted in NML
and the overall tumor tissues consisting of HNSCC and
NML (Supplementary Table S7).

Discussion
We identified significant upregulation of miR-31 in HNSCC
tumors and cell lines, which is similar to the situation with
several important human cancers (7, 21–24). However, only
expression studies were carried out during the above research, and no study up to the present has ever addressed
the regulation and function of miR-31 in HNSCC, CRC, or
HCC (7, 21–24). Our functional characterization verified the
oncogenic roles of miR-31 in HNSCC, and this result was supported by the enhancement of in vitro oncogenicity and tumorigenesis after overexpression in cell lines. The oncogenic
roles of miR-31 were also substantiated by in vitro or in vivo
clues from miR-31 blockage. It seems that the increase in tumor induction was limited when miR-31 was overexpressed
in SAS and OECM-1 cells. Because the endogenous expression of miR-31 has been found to be high in HNSCC tissues
and cells, the exogenously expressed miR-31 might allow only
limited further enhancement of tumor growth. We provide
evidence that the oncogenic potential of miR-31 is abrogated

in hypoxia status. As a consequence, SAS or OECM-1 xenografts are postulated to contain a high fraction of hypoxic
cells and limited miR-31 functionality. Our study also confirmed the upregulation of miR-21 and miR-371 in HNSCC
(6–8). Although the dissection power of miR-21 expression
did not exceed that of miR-31 in distinguishing benign from
malignant status, miR-21 should still play key roles in HNSCC
and other malignancies, because it targets crucial suppressors (4, 5, 8, 33).
Hypoxia is linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition,
metastasis, and therapy resistance among neoplasms (12).
Using blockers, an exogenous expression system, reporters,
and mutant constructs, we were able to verify that miR-31
targets the conservative complementary sequence in the 3′
UTR of FIH and transactivates HIF under normoxia. This resulted in an increase in VEGF and other factors that could be
contributive to the HNSCC pathogenesis (11, 12). Although
miR-17-92 cluster and miR-210 were shown involved in the
regulation of hypoxia (34–36), this is the first study that identifies a miRNA, which is overexpressed in HNSCC, as being
involved in the indirect activation of HIF through targeting
FIH during normoxia. Several HNSCCs were found to have
extremely low miR-31 expression. Loss of heterozygosity at

9p21 frequently altered in HNSCC could be the underlying
genomic event (37). Preliminary analyses showed that miR21 repressed FIH, whereas further analyses are required to
clarify FIH as a target of miR-21. Because miR-21 expression
was correlated with miR-31 expression in HNSCC, their synergistism for HNSCC development should be unraveled. It
was known that HIF activation occurs during hypoxia and
that this usually occurs at a late stage of neoplastic process.
Because the downregulation of miR-31 occurs in metastatic
breast carcinoma (27) and tumor metastasis occurs mainly in
deeper tissue regions probably having oxygen deficiency (38),
wherein miR-31 could be unable to activate HIF to augment
the aggressiveness of HNSCC, different mechanisms regulated by FIH in hypoxic tumor regions must be further investigated. Whether miR-21 plays more prominent roles for
HNSCC metastasis than miR-31 is also an interesting issue
to be addressed (8).
FIH suppressed HNSCC during normoxia, and the suppression was abrogated in hypoxic culture. The findings were
concordant with the fact that miR-31 enhanced oncogenicity
only when oxygen supply is sufficient. This study also provided functional clues by inactivating FIH using mutant constructs, which specified the requirement of FIH activity for

the tumor suppression in normoxia (16, 17). Nuclear FIH was
prominent in the superbasal layers of NCMT, whereas it was
significantly decreased in HNSCC. Nuclear FIH expression
was opposite to the miR-31 expression in HNSCC. Moreover,
a reverse association between nuclear FIH expression and
VEGF expression was also found in tumor tissues. These
lines of tissue evidence together with the functional clues
provided above indicated a miR-31-FIH-HIF cascade involved
in HNSCC development in normoxia state. Because a reverse
association between nuclear FIH expression and VEGF expression was also noted in metastatic lesions, it suggested
that the oxygen level in these tissues could be sufficient for
nuclear FIH to hydroxylate HIF. The high abundance of FIH
protein, particularly cytosolic FIH, was found in HNSCC tissues and cell lines and in other types of cancers (39). In

HNSCC cells with exogenous FIH expression, the FIH is localized mainly in cytosol with only a small fraction of the FIH
being distributed to the nucleus or onto the membrane (40).
In addition, the high cytosolic FIH levels seem to define a
poor prognosis or progression for breast carcinoma, non–
small cell lung carcinoma, and pancreatic endocrine tumors
(18–20). The high abundance of FIH in the cytosol of HNSCC
cells might act as a reservoir and allows it to act as a direct
oxygen sensor. Alternatively, because FIH also modulates
Notch and IκBα by hydroxylation (14, 15, 39, 40), the stability
or activity of Notch and IκBα being regulated by cytosolic
FIH for pathogenesis requires further stratification using specific constructs.
This study identified that miR-31 contributes to HNSCC
development through HIF activation in tumor regions,

miR-31 expression was known to repress several target genes
to inhibit the metastasis of breast carcinomas (27); thereby,
the identification of other miR-31 targets and pluripotent actions of miR-31 involved in different neoplastic stage of tumorigenesis will be important. Further understanding of
the pathogenetic significance of other aberrantly expressed
miRNAs identified in this study may eventually contribute
to diagnosis and interception of HNSCC (11).
