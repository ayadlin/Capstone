Abstract
Gemcitabine is currently the best treatment available for
pancreatic cancer, but the disease develops resistance to the
drug over time. Agents that can either enhance the effects of
gemcitabine or overcome chemoresistance to the drug are
needed for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Curcumin, a
component of turmeric (Curcuma longa), is one such agent
that has been shown to suppress the transcription factor
nuclear factor-KB (NF-KB), which is implicated in proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, and chemoresistance. In this
study, we investigated whether curcumin can sensitize pancreatic cancer to gemcitabine in vitro and in vivo. In vitro,
curcumin inhibited the proliferation of various pancreatic
cancer cell lines, potentiated the apoptosis induced by
gemcitabine, and inhibited constitutive NF-KB activation in
the cells. In vivo, tumors from nude mice injected with
pancreatic cancer cells and treated with a combination of
curcumin and gemcitabine showed significant reductions in
volume (P = 0.008 versus control; P = 0.036 versus gemcitabine
alone), Ki-67 proliferation index (P = 0.030 versus control),
NF-KB activation, and expression of NF-KB–regulated gene
products (cyclin D1, c-myc, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, cellular inhibitor of
apoptosis protein-1, cyclooxygenase-2, matrix metalloproteinase, and vascular endothelial growth factor) compared with
tumors from control mice treated with olive oil only. The
combination treatment was also highly effective in suppressing angiogenesis as indicated by a decrease in CD31+ microvessel density (P = 0.018 versus control). Overall, our results
suggest that curcumin potentiates the antitumor effects of
gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer by suppressing proliferation, angiogenesis, NF-KB, and NF-KB–regulated gene products. [Cancer Res 2007;67(8):3853–61]

Introduction
Pancreatic cancer is now the fourth leading cause of deaths in the
United States with an overall 5-year survival rate of <5%. In 2006, it
was estimated that 32,300 men and women would die of pancreatic
cancer in the United States (1). The poor prognosis of pancreatic

cancer is attributable to its tendency for late presentation,
aggressive local invasion, early metastases, and poor response to
chemotherapy (2). Currently, gemcitabine remains the best
chemotherapeutic agent available for the treatment of advanced
pancreatic cancer. However, gemcitabine treatment results in an
objective tumor response rate of <10% and only a marginal survival
advantage (3) and is associated with multiple adverse events and
drug resistance. Thus, there is a need for novel strategies involving
less toxic agents that can sensitize pancreatic cancer cells to
chemotherapy.
The transcription factor nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) has been
linked with cell proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, metastasis,
suppression of apoptosis, and chemoresistance in multiple tumors
(4, 5). In addition, numerous lines of evidence suggest that NF-nB
plays a major role in the growth and chemoresistance of pancreatic
cancer. First, NF-nB is constitutively active in pancreatic cancer cells
(6) but not in immortalized, nontumorigenic pancreatic ductal
epithelial cells (7). Second, NF-nB activation has been reported
in animal models of pancreatic cancer (8) and in human pancreatic
cancer tissue (6). Third, NF-nB promotes pancreatic cancer growth
via inhibition of apoptosis (6, 9) and mediates induction of mitogenic gene products, such as c-myc and cyclin D1 (10). Fourth, cyclin
D1 is overexpressed in human pancreatic cancer tissue and inversely
correlated with patient survival (11). Fifth, NF-nB enhances the
angiogenic potential of pancreatic cancer cells via increased
expression of proangiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF; ref. 12). Sixth, NF-nB–regulated gene products
promote migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells (13).
Finally, NF-nB plays a pivotal role in promoting gemcitabine
resistance in pancreatic cancer (5). Together, this evidence
implicates the role of NF-nB in pancreatic cancer and suggests that
agents that block NF-nB activation could reduce chemoresistance
to gemcitabine and perhaps be used in combination with
gemcitabine as a novel therapeutic regimen for pancreatic cancer.
Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a derivative of the spice turmeric
(Curcuma longa), is one such agent (Fig. 1A) that is nontoxic to
humans (14). Curcumin has been shown to suppress NF-nB activation (15) and down-regulate the expression of NF-nB–regulated
gene products with roles in antiapoptosis [Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, X-linked
inhibitor of apoptosis protein, and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis
protein-1 (cIAP-1)], proliferation [cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), cyclin
D1, and c-myc], angiogenesis (VEGF and interleukin-8), invasion
[matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)], and metastasis [intercellular
adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1,
and endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1; refs. 16–18].
Furthermore, this phytochemical has been shown to induce the

apoptosis of tumor cells through activation of caspases, cleavage of
the proapoptotic protein BID, and release of cytochrome c (19).
Curcumin has also been shown to suppress angiogenesis in vivo
(20–22). Previously, we have shown that curcumin can suppress the
growth of human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro (23) and in vivo (24).
This has led to testing of curcumin in patients with advanced
pancreatic cancer (25).
In this study, we investigated whether curcumin can potentiate
the antitumor effects of gemcitabine against pancreatic cancer
cells growing in vitro or in vivo. We found that curcumin

potentiated the apoptotic effects of gemcitabine in pancreatic
cancer cells in vitro and significantly enhanced the antitumor

mice by down-regulating NF-nB–regulated gene products and
suppression of angiogenesis.

Sabinsa (Piscataway, NJ). The following polyclonal antibodies against p65
(recognizing the epitope within the NH2-terminal domain of human NF-nB
p65), ICAM-1, cyclin D1, MMP-9, survivin, cIAP-1, procaspase-3, and
procaspase-9 and monoclonal antibodies against VEGF, COX-2, c-myc,
Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa
Cruz, CA). The liquid DAB+ Substrate Chromogen System-HRP used for
immunocytochemistry was obtained from DakoCytomation (Carpinteria,
CA). Penicillin, streptomycin, RPMI 1640, and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were
obtained from Invitrogen (Grand Island, NY). Tris, glycine, NaCl, SDS, and
bovine serum albumin (BSA) were obtained from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis,
MO). Gemcitabine (Gemzar; kindly supplied by Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN)
was stored at 4jC and dissolved in sterile PBS on the day of use. D-luciferin
potassium salt (Xenogen, Hopkinton, MA) was dissolved in sterile PBS at
40 mg/mL concentration.
Cell lines. The pancreatic cancer cell lines BxPC-3, MIA PaCa-2, and
Panc-1 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA). MPanc-96 was a kind gift from Dr. C. Logsdon [University
of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC), Houston, TX]. All cell
lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/
mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin.
Proliferation assay. The effect of curcumin on cell proliferation was
determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) uptake method as described previously (26). The cells
(2,000 per well) were incubated with curcumin in triplicate in a 96-well plate
and then incubated for 2, 4, or 6 days at 37jC. A MTT solution was added
to each well and incubated for 2 h at 37jC. An extraction buffer (20% SDS
and 50% dimethylformamide) was added, and the cells were incubated
overnight at 37jC. The absorbance of the cell suspension was measured at
570 nm using an MRX Revelation 96-well multiscanner (Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA). This experiment was repeated twice, and the
statistical analysis (simple linear regression analysis initially and then
unpaired Student’s t test that revealed significant differences between two
sample means) was done to obtain the final values.
Apoptosis assay. To determine whether curcumin can potentiate the
apoptotic effects of gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer cells, we used a
Live/Dead assay kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), which determines
intracellular esterase activity and plasma membrane integrity. This assay
uses calcein, a polyanionic, green fluorescent dye that is retained within live
cells, and a red fluorescent ethidium bromide homodimer dye that can
enter cells through damaged membranes and bind to nucleic acids but is
excluded by the intact plasma membranes of live cells (26). Briefly, cells
(5,000 per well) were incubated in chamber slides, pretreated with curcumin
for 4 h, and treated with gemcitabine for 24 h. Cells were then stained with
the assay reagents for 30 min at room temperature. Cell viability was
determined under a fluorescence microscope by counting live (green) and
dead (red) cells. This experiment was repeated twice and the statistical
analysis was done. The values were initially subjected to one-way ANOVA,
which revealed significant differences between groups, and then later
compared among groups using unpaired Student’s t test, which revealed
significant differences between two sample means.
Animals. Male athymic nu/nu mice (4 weeks old) were obtained from
the breeding colony of the Department of Experimental Radiation Oncology
at UTMDACC. The animals were housed four per cage in the standard mice
plexiglass cages in a room maintained at constant temperature and
humidity under 12-h light and darkness cycle and fed with regular autoclave
chow diet with water ad libitum. None of the mice exhibited any lesions,
and all were tested pathogen-free. Before initiating the experiment, we
acclimatized all mice to a pulverized diet for 3 days. Our experimental
protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee at UTMDACC.
Orthotopic implantation of MIA PaCa-2 cells. MIA PaCa-2 cells were
stably transfected with luciferase as previously described for Panc-1 cells
(27). Luciferase-transfected MIA PaCa-2 cells were harvested from
subconfluent cultures after a brief exposure to 0.25% trypsin and 0.2%
EDTA. Trypsinization was stopped with medium containing 10% FBS. The
cells were washed once in serum-free medium and resuspended in PBS.
Only suspensions consisting of single cells, with >90% viability, were used

www.aacrjournals.org

for the injections. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine solution, a small left abdominal flank incision was made, and MIA PaCa-2 cells
(1  106) in 100 AL PBS were injected into the subcapsular region of the
pancreas using a 27-gauge needle and a calibrated push button–controlled
dispensing device (Hamilton Syringe Co., Reno, NV). To prevent leakage, a
cotton swab was held cautiously for 1 min over the site of injection. The
abdominal wound was closed in one layer with wound clips (Braintree
Scientific, Inc., Braintree, MA).
Experimental protocol. After 1 week of implantation, mice were
randomized into the following treatment groups (n = 6) based on the
bioluminescence measured after the first IVIS imaging: (a) untreated
control (olive oil, 100 AL daily); (b) curcumin alone (1 g/kg), once daily
p.o.; (c) gemcitabine alone (25 mg/kg), twice weekly by i.p. injection; and
(d) combination of curcumin (1 g/kg), once daily p.o., and gemcitabine
(25 mg/kg), twice weekly by i.p. injection. Tumor volumes were monitored
weekly by the bioluminescence IVIS Imaging System 200 using a cryogenically cooled imaging system coupled to a data acquisition computer
running Living Image software (Xenogen Corp., Alameda, CA). Before
imaging, animals were anesthetized in an acrylic chamber with 2.5%
isoflurane/air mixture and injected i.p. with 40 mg/mL D-luciferin potassium salt in PBS at a dose of 150 mg/kg body weight. After 10 min of
incubation with luciferin, mice were placed in a right lateral decubitus
position and a digital grayscale animal image was acquired followed by
acquisition and overlay of a pseudocolor image representing the spatial
distribution of detected photons emerging from active luciferase within
the animal. Signal intensity was quantified as the sum of all detected
photons within the region of interest per second. Mice were imaged on
days 0, 7, 14, 21, 24, and 31 of treatment. Therapy was continued for
4 weeks and animals were sacrificed 1 week later. Primary tumors in
the pancreas were excised and the final tumor volume was measured as
V = 2 / 3kr 3, where r is the mean of the three dimensions (length, width,
and depth). The final tumor volumes were initially subjected to one-way
ANOVA and then later compared among groups using unpaired Student’s
t test. Half of the tumor tissue was formalin fixed and paraffin embedded
for immunohistochemistry and routine H&E staining. The other half was
snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80jC. H&E staining
confirmed the presence of tumor(s) in each pancreas.
Preparation of nuclear extract from tumor samples. Pancreatic
tumor tissues (75–100 mg/mouse) from control and experimental mice
were minced and incubated on ice for 30 min in 0.5 mL of ice-cold
buffer A [10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mmol/L KCl, 10 mmol/L MgCl2,
0.5 mmol/L DTT, 0.5 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)]. The
minced tissue was homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer and
centrifuged at 16,000  g at 4jC for 10 min. The resulting nuclear pellet
was suspended in 0.2 mL of buffer B [20 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9), 25%
glycerol, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 420 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5 mmol/L DTT, 0.2 mmol/L
EDTA, 0.5 mmol/L PMSF, 2 Ag/mL leupeptin] and incubated on ice for
2 h with intermittent mixing. The suspension was then centrifuged at
16,000  g at 4jC for 30 min. The supernatant (nuclear extract) was
collected and stored at 70jC until use. Protein concentration was
measured by the Bradford assay with BSA as the standard.
NF-KB activation in pancreatic cancer cells and tumor samples. To
assess NF-nB activation, we isolated nuclei from pancreatic cancer cell lines
and tumor samples and carried out electrophoretic mobility shift assays
(EMSA) essentially as described previously (28). Briefly, nuclear extracts
prepared from pancreatic cancer cells (1  106/mL) and tumor samples
were incubated with 32P-end-labeled 45-mer double-stranded NF-nB
oligonucleotide (4 Ag of protein with 16 fmol of DNA) from the HIV long
terminal repeat (5¶-TTGTTACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGGGGAGGCGTGG-3¶; italicized indicates NF-nB–binding sites) for 15 min at
37jC. The resulting DNA-protein complex was separated from free
oligonucleotide on 6.6% native polyacrylamide gels. A double-stranded
mutant oligonucleotide (5¶-TTGTTACAACTCACTTTCCGCTGCTCACTTTCCAGGGAGGCGTGG-3¶) was used to examine the specificity of binding of
NF-nB to the DNA. The dried gels were visualized, and radioactive bands
were quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale,
CA) using ImageQuant software.

Immunolocalization of NF-KB p65, VEGF, and COX-2 in tumor
samples. The nuclear localization of p65 and expression of COX-2, and
VEGF were examined using an immunohistochemical method described
previously (29). Briefly, pancreatic cancer tumor samples were embedded in
paraffin and fixed with paraformaldehyde. After being washed in PBS, the
slides were blocked with protein block solution (DakoCytomation) for
20 min and then incubated overnight with rabbit polyclonal anti-human
p65, mouse monoclonal anti-human VEGF, and anti-COX-2 antibodies
(1:100, 1:50, and 1:75, respectively). After the incubation, the slides were
washed and then incubated with biotinylated link universal antiserum
followed by horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin conjugate (LSAB+ kit). The
slides were rinsed, and color was developed using 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine
hydrochloride as a chromogen. Finally, sections were rinsed in distilled
water, counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin, and mounted with DPX
mounting medium for evaluation. Pictures were captured with a Photometrics CoolSNAP CF color camera (Nikon, Lewisville, TX) and MetaMorph
version 4.6.5 software (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA).
Ki-67 immunohistochemistry. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections (5 Am) were stained with anti-Ki-67 (rabbit monoclonal clone SP6;
NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA) antibody as described previously (30). Results were
expressed as percentage of Ki-67+ cells F SE per 40 magnification. A total of
ten 40 fields was examined and counted from three tumors of each of the
treatment groups. The values were initially subjected to one-way ANOVA and
then later compared among groups using unpaired Student’s t test.
Microvessel density. Ethanol-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections (5 Am)
were stained with rat anti-mouse CD31 monoclonal antibody (PharMingen,
San Diego, CA) as described previously (30). Areas of greatest vessel density
were then examined under higher magnification (100) and counted. Any
distinct area of positive staining for CD31 was counted as a single vessel.
Results were expressed as the mean number of vessels F SE per high-power
field (100). A total of 20 high-power fields was examined and counted
from three tumors of each of the treatment groups. The values were initially
subjected to one-way ANOVA and then later compared among groups using
unpaired Student’s t test.
Western blot analysis. Pancreatic tumor tissues (75–100 mg/mouse)
from control and experimental mice were minced and incubated on ice for
30 min in 0.5 mL of ice-cold whole-cell lysate buffer (10% NP40, 5 mol/L
NaCl, 1 mol/L HEPES, 0.1 mol/L EGTA, 0.5 mol/L EDTA, 0.1 mol/L PMSF, 0.2
mol/L sodium orthovanadate, 1 mol/L NaF, 2 Ag/mL aprotinin, 2 Ag/mL
leupeptin). The minced tissue was homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 16,000  g at 4jC for 10 min. The proteins were
then fractionated by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blotted with each antibody, and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ).

Results
The goal of this study was, first, to determine whether curcumin,
also called diferuloylmethane (Fig. 1A), potentiates the antitumor
effects of gemcitabine in vitro and in vivo against human pancreatic
cancer and, second, to delineate the mechanism of potentiation.
Four different pancreatic cancer cell lines were selected for this
investigation. To facilitate the imaging of the tumor in the animals,
luciferase-transfected MIA PaCa-2 cells were used.
Curcumin inhibits proliferation, potentiates the apoptotic
effects of gemcitabine, and inhibits constitutive NF-KB
activation in pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. To determine
whether curcumin inhibits the proliferation of human pancreatic
cancer cells, we used MIA PaCa-2, MPanc-96, and Panc-1, all of
which exhibit K-Ras and p53 mutations, and BxPC-3 with wild-type
K-Ras. These cell lines were tested for viability using a MTT assay
after incubation with 0, 10, or 50 Amol/L of curcumin for 2, 4, or
6 days. Curcumin inhibited the proliferation of all four pancreatic
cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner irrespective of the
genetic background (Fig. 1B).

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (8). April 15, 2007

To determine whether curcumin enhances the induction of
apoptosis by gemcitabine, we tested the four cell lines with a Live/
Dead apoptosis assay. Our results showed that, at a dose at which
curcumin (10 Amol/L) and gemcitabine (50 nmol/L) alone were
minimally effective, the two together were highly effective (Fig. 1C).
Because this combined effect was the greatest in MIA PaCa-2 cells,
this cell line was used in further experiments.
We next used a DNA-binding assay to examine whether pancreatic
cancer cells express constitutive NF-nB. All four cell lines expressed
constitutive NF-nB, although levels were higher in BxPC-3 and
Panc-1 cells than in MIA PaCa-2 and MPanc-96 cells (Fig. 1D, left).
Treatment of MIA PaCa-2 cells with curcumin down-regulated
NF-nB activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1D, right).
Curcumin potentiates the antitumor, antiproliferative, and
antiangiogenic effects of gemcitabine in orthotopic pancreatic
tumors in nude mice. We examined the effects of curcumin and
gemcitabine, alone or in combination, on the growth of orthotopically implanted pancreatic tumors (Fig. 2A). MIA PaCa-2 cells
were implanted in the pancreatic tails of nude mice. Based on the
IVIS imaging, 1 week later, the mice were randomized into four
groups. The treatment was started 1 week after the tumor cell
implantation, continued as per experimental protocol for 4 weeks.
The animals were sacrificed 6 weeks after tumor cell injection and
5 weeks from the date of treatment (Fig. 2A). We did the IVIS
imaging on days 7, 14, 21, 24, and 31 after the start of treatment.
The bioluminescence imaging results (Fig. 2B, right and left)
indicated a gradual increase in tumor volume in the control group
compared with the three treatment groups. The tumor volume in
the combination of curcumin and gemcitabine group was
significantly lower than the gemcitabine alone or control group
by day 31 of treatment (P < 0.05 versus gemcitabine; P < 0.001
versus control). The final tumor volumes on day 35 after the start
of treatment showed significant decrease in the curcumin +
gemcitabine group compared with control (P < 0.01 versus control)
or with gemcitabine alone (P < 0.05 versus gemcitabine; Fig. 2C,
right and left). The tumor volumes in curcumin alone and gemcitabine alone groups were not statistically significant compared
with control group (P = 0.399 and 0.147, respectively).
We next examined the expression of the cell proliferation marker
Ki-67 and the microvessel density marker CD31 in tumor tissues
from the four groups. The results in Fig. 3A and B showed that
curcumin in combination with gemcitabine significantly downregulated the expression of Ki-67 in tumor tissues compared with
the control group (P < 0.05 versus control). The results also showed
that curcumin alone significantly suppressed the expression of
CD31 (P < 0.05 versus control), and the presence of gemcitabine
further enhanced the down-regulation of CD31 (P < 0.05 versus
control; Fig. 3C and D).
Curcumin inhibits NF-KB activation in orthotopic pancreatic tumors. We investigated whether the effect of curcumin on
tumor growth in mice is associated with the inhibition of NF-nB
activation. The EMSA results showed that curcumin alone completely suppressed NF-nB activation in tumor samples (Fig. 4A).
We found that curcumin also suppressed NF-nB activation in
gemcitabine-treated animals.
Curcumin potentiates the effect of gemcitabine in downregulating the expression of NF-KB–regulated gene products.
NF-nB is known to regulate the expression of COX-2 (involved in
proliferation), MMP-9 (involved in invasion), and ICAM-1 (involved
in metastasis; ref. 4). Accordingly, we observed increased expression of these molecules in orthotopic pancreatic tumors.

and 0.147 (control versus gemcitabine).

Immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 4B) and Western blotting
(Fig. 4C) revealed significant reductions in the expression of COX-2 in
tumors from the curcumin-treated groups compared with those from
the control group. Gemcitabine alone, in contrast, did not significantly reduce the expression of COX-2. Western blotting (Fig. 4C)
showed that curcumin alone also significantly decreased the expression of MMP-9 and ICAM-1 compared with the control treatment.
We also assessed the expression of the NF-nB–regulated genes
VEGF, which plays an important role in angiogenesis; cyclin D1 and
c-myc, which are involved in tumor cell proliferation; and survivin,
Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and IAP-1, the overexpression of which has been linked
to tumor survival, chemoresistance, and radioresistance (31–34).
Immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 4B) and Western blotting
(Fig. 4C) revealed that curcumin, alone or in combination with

www.aacrjournals.org

gemcitabine, significantly decreased the expression of all of these
molecules compared with the control treatment in pancreatic
tumor tissues. The Western blot results also showed that curcumin,
alone or in combination with gemcitabine, decreased the expression
of procaspase-3 and procaspase-9 (Fig. 4D).

Discussion
The aim of this study was to determine whether curcumin, a
well-known dietary component, can sensitize pancreatic cancer to
gemcitabine. In various pancreatic cancer cell lines, curcumin
inhibited proliferation, potentiated the apoptosis induced by
gemcitabine, and inhibited constitutive NF-nB activation. In an

effects of gemcitabine; this effect was associated with suppression
of Ki-67, down-regulation of NF-nB activation and NF-nB–
regulated gene products, and inhibition of angiogenesis as
indicated by a decrease in microvessel density.
This is the first report to show that curcumin enhances the
apoptotic effects of gemcitabine in cultured pancreatic cancer
cells. Gemcitabine alone had a minimal effect on apoptosis in
BxPC-3, Panc-1, MIA PaCa-2 and MPanc-96 cell lines. Another
report similarly showed that BxPC-3, Capan-1, and PancTu-1 cells
are unaffected by gemcitabine (5). The mechanism by which
curcumin potentiates the apoptotic effects of gemcitabine may
involve suppression of NF-nB. All four pancreatic cancer cell lines
studied showed constitutive NF-nB activation, which was downregulated by curcumin. NF-nB has been linked with chemo-

resistance (35), so it is very likely that the down-regulation of
NF-nB by curcumin sensitized the cells to gemcitabine. These
results agree with a previous report in which MG132, sulfasalazine,
and the InBa superrepressor sensitized pancreatic cancer cells to
gemcitabine (5). Similarly, genistein has been shown to sensitize
prostate cancer cells to gemcitabine through the down-regulation of
NF-nB (36).
In addition to these in vitro results, we found that curcumin
potentiates the antitumor effects of gemcitabine in an orthotopic
model of pancreatic cancer as indicated by a decrease in tumor
volume measured by two independent methods. Similarly, genistein
in combination with gemcitabine has been shown to have a much
more potent antitumor effect than either agent alone in an
orthotopic tumor model (36).

Curcumin Potentiates Gemcitabine in Pancreatic Cancer

How curcumin potentiates the effects of gemcitabine in vivo was
investigated in several ways. First, analysis of microvessel density
(CD31) and proliferation index (Ki-67) revealed that these two
markers were decreased by curcumin. Second, NF-nB analysis of
the tumor tissues showed that curcumin alone completely suppressed constitutive NF-nB activation in pancreatic cancer tissues, a
finding consistent with the immunohistochemical analysis of the
NF-nB subunit p65. Third, immunohistochemical analysis also
showed that curcumin down-regulated the expression of VEGF,
which is closely linked with angiogenesis. Fourth, the expression of
COX-2, which is linked with growth and metastasis, was significantly
suppressed in tumor tissues from curcumin-treated mice. Finally,
Western blot analysis of Bcl-2, survivin, Bcl-xL, and cIAP-1 showed
that curcumin alone could inhibit the expression of these
antiapoptotic proteins in pancreatic tumor samples.

Our finding that curcumin down-regulated COX-2 expression in
pancreatic cancer tissues is notable, as COX-2 is overexpressed in
chronic pancreatitis (37) and in human pancreatic cancer tissue.
COX-2 expression has been associated with a lower apoptotic index
(38), increased cell proliferation (39), increased risk of metastasis
(40, 41), and enhanced VEGF production, leading to angiogenesis in
pancreatic tumors (42, 43). This is consistent with a recent report that
indicates a synergistic action of curcumin with celecoxib, a specific
COX-2 inhibitor, against pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells (44).
Our results also showed that curcumin inhibited the expression
of several important NF-nB–regulated proteins in vivo. For instance,
cyclin D1, known to be overexpressed in pancreatic tumor tissues,
was down-regulated by curcumin. We found that curcumin also
suppressed the ICAM-1 expression in tumor tissues. Overexpression
of ICAM-1 has been well documented in malignant cells, including

in pancreatic tumor tissues. D, Western

pancreatic cancer cells (45). Similarly, we also found that curcumin
inhibited MMP-9 expression in vivo. Multiple studies used newly
developed synthetic MMP inhibitors in experimental models of
pancreatic cancer and showed that the agents reduced tumor
growth and increased survival of mice (46). The myc proteins,
which are known to play a central role in cellular proliferation,
differentiation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis, are overexpressed
in pancreatic cancer (47). We found that curcumin inhibited c-myc
expression in vivo. Finally, our results also showed that curcumin
inhibited several NF-nB–regulated antiapoptotic proteins, including survivin, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and cIAP-1. The results suggested
that curcumin enhanced the apoptotic effect of gemcitabine in
pancreatic cancer tumor tissues by inhibiting these antiapoptotic
proteins.
Overall, our results showed that curcumin potentiates the
antitumor effects of gemcitabine by inhibiting NF-nB and its
downstream targets, leading to the inhibition of proliferation,
angiogenesis, and invasion. The dose of gemcitabine (25 mg/kg)

and curcumin (1 g/kg) used in the current animal studies is quite
relevant to that in human subjects. Because curcumin is very well
tolerated in human subjects, even at very high doses (21), the
combination of curcumin with gemcitabine has significant
potential as an effective therapy for pancreatic cancer that can
enhance the effect of gemcitabine and overcome chemoresistance.
Further clinical studies are necessary to confirm our findings in
patients with pancreatic cancer.
