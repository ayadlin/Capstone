Abstract
Sporadic human mismatch repair (MMR)–deficient colorectal
cancers account for f12.5% of all cases of colorectal cancer.
MMR-deficient colorectal cancers are classically characterized
by right-sided location, multifocality, mucinous histology, and
lymphocytic infiltration. However, tumors in germ-line MMRdeficient mouse models lack these histopathologic features.
Mice lacking the heterotrimeric G protein A subunit GiA2
develop chronic colitis and multifocal, right-sided cancers
with mucinous histopathology, similar to human MMRdeficient colorectal cancer. Young GiA2 / colonic epithelium
has normal MMR expression but selectively loses MLH1 and
consequently PMS2 expression following inflammation.
GiA2 / cancers have microsatellite instability. Mlh1 is
epigenetically silenced not by promoter hypermethylation
but by decreased histone acetylation. Chronically inflamed
GiA2 / colonic mucosa contains patchy hypoxia, with
increased crypt expression of the hypoxia markers DEC-1
and BNIP3. Chromatin immunoprecipitation identified increased binding of the transcriptional repressor DEC-1 to the
proximal Mlh1 promoter in hypoxic YAMC cells and colitic
GiA2 / crypts. Treating GiA2 / mice with the histone
deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid significantly decreased colitis activity and rescued MLH1 expression
in crypt epithelial cells, which was associated with increased
acetyl histone H3 levels and decreased DEC-1 binding at the
proximal Mlh1 promoter, consistent with a histone deacetylase–dependent mechanism. These data link chronic hypoxic
inflammation, epigenetic MMR protein down-regulation,
development of MMR-deficient colorectal cancer, and the
first mouse model of somatically acquired MMR-deficient
colorectal cancer. [Cancer Res 2009;69(16):6423–9]

Introduction
DNA mismatch repair (MMR)–deficient colorectal cancers have
distinct features that distinguish them from other colorectal cancer
types (1). These include increased frameshift mutation rates
[commonly called microsatellite instability (MSI)], multifocality,

increased likelihood of right-sided colon cancer location, nonpolyposis pathology, mucinous histology, and presence of a
Crohn’s-like lymphocytic infiltrate in tumors (2, 3).
MMR-deficient colorectal cancers arise through three distinct
genetic mechanisms. First, monoallelic germ-line MMR mutation
and somatic loss of the second MMR allele causes hereditary
nonpolyposis colon cancer, also known as Lynch syndrome. Lynch
syndrome carriers body tissues are MMR-proficient because of the
other allele. As predicted by the Knudson hypothesis, the second
MMR gene allele is somatically lost in some cells, which then
become MMR-deficient and transform into colorectal cancer and
other cancers. The second mechanism is biallelic germ-line
constitutive MMR gene mutation, where all body tissues are
MMR-deficient. These patients have a different clinical phenotype,
with very early-onset hematologic, brain, and small intestinal
cancers (4–6). Although colorectal cancers can develop, penetrance
is low and arise more commonly in the left colon (4, 5).
The third genetic mechanism, de novo sporadic MMR-deficient
colorectal cancers, accounts for f12.5% of colorectal cancer (6). Both
MMR alleles are somatically mutated or epigenetically inactivated in
some cells, which transform into cancer. Mlh1 promoter hypermethylation is the most common cause of sporadic MMR-deficient
colorectal cancer (7–9). In vitro studies have shown that epigenetic
Mlh1 inactivation can also occur via hypoxia-induced transcriptional
repression of the proximal Mlh1 promoter by histone deacetylases
(HDAC; ref. 9). However, whether this mechanism is relevant to
in vivo colorectal cancer tumorigenesis is unknown.
Multiple biallelic MMR germ-line knockout mouse models have
been created (Supplementary Table S1). These mutations primarily
cause lymphomas and small intestine adenomas (10–16) Only
rarely do these models develop colorectal cancer, and mucinous,
nonpolyposis, or proximal colon colorectal cancers essentially
never arise. These models are therefore more similar to human
biallelic germ-line constitutive MMR deficiency than somatically
acquired MMR deficiency syndromes.
Gia2 is a heterotrimeric G protein a subunit, the deletion of
which in mice leads to spontaneous colitis and nonpolyposis,
right-sided, multifocal colorectal cancers with mucinous histology
and a Crohn’s-like inflammatory infiltrate (17–19). The similarities
between Gia2 / mouse colorectal cancer and somatically
acquired human MMR-deficient colorectal cancer (Supplementary
Table S1) led us to investigate whether acquired MMR silencing
might contribute as a mechanism of colorectal cancer tumorigenesis in Gia2 / mice. We found that MLH1 and PMS2 protein levels
in crypts are initially normal but are suppressed following the onset
of hypoxic colitis. Hypoxia induces colonic expression of the bHLH
transcriptional repressor DEC-1 and enhances its binding to the
proximal Mlh1 promoter, thereby repressing MLH1 expression and

leading to MSI. Treatment of Gia2 / mice with HDAC inhibitor
(HDACi) decreases colitis and relieves epigenetic repression of
MLH1 expression. In summary, we describe the first mouse model
of somatically acquired MMR deficiency and show that hypoxiainduced Mlh1 silencing may be another important epigenetic
mechanism contributing to the development of MMR-deficient
colorectal cancer.

Materials and Methods
Mice. Wild-type (WT) and Gia2 / mice on a cross-bred 129Sv/C57BL6
background were genotyped as described previously (19). All experiments
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at
University of California-Irvine.
In vivo assessment of apoptosis induction. Age-matched WT and
Gia2 / mice were injected i.p. with 20 mg/kg 1,2-dimethylhydrazine for
24 h. Sections (5 Am) of fixed control and 1,2-dimethylhydrazine–treated
colons were stained for apoptotic cells using an Apoptag staining kit
(Chemicon). The data are expressed as the mean F SE of the normalized
ratio of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end
labeling–positive/propidium iodide–positive cells.
Colonic crypt isolation, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting. Rinsed
small intestine and colon segments were reverted on a Labconco vibratory
stirrer and shaken in 30 mmol/L EDTA in HBSS. Crypts liberated between
20 and 40 min (>98% pure by cytospin analysis) were used for Western
blotting and quantitative real-time PCR. Antibodies used include MLH1 (BD
Pharmingen; clone G168-728), PMS2 (BD Pharmingen; clone A16-4), MSH2
(Calbiochem; clone FE11), MSH6 (Abcam; clone 44), DEC-1 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology; clone S-8), BNIP-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; clone Ana40),
and h-actin (Sigma; clone 20-33).
Immunohistochemistry. WT (n = 24) and Gia2 / (n = 22) colon
sections were microwaved (20 min) in citrate buffer. After peroxidase,
biotin, and endogenous IgG blocking, anti-MMR antibodies (described
above) were added overnight at 4jC and then developed using peroxidasebased detection. Eight mucinous and 17 nonmucinous carcinomas located
throughout the colon were stained.
Laser capture microdissection of mouse crypt epithelium and colon
cancer cells. Formalin-fixed, deparaffinized WT and Gia2 / colon
sections on PENfoil slides (Leica) were microdissected using a Leica ASLMD. Genomic DNA from regions of WT or inflamed Gia2 / crypts and
Gia2 / cancers was purified using a PureGene DNA isolation kit (Qiagen)
and used for MSI and promoter methylation studies.
MSI analysis. Individual microsatellite templates were analyzed for
insertion/deletion mutations by single-molecule PCR using standard
protocols (20, 21). Briefly, DNA isolated from laser capture–microdissected
Gia2 / and WT colons was diluted to 0.5 to 1.5 single-genome equivalents
followed by PCR amplification by mononucleotide microsatellite markers
A33 and L24375.
DNA methylation analysis. Genomic DNA (650 ng) from WT and colitic
Gia2 / crypts (n = 7 each) was modified using an Imprint DNA Modification
Kit (Sigma). PCR primers, complementary to the modified or unmodified
sequence, were designed for the proximal Mlh1 promoter region. For the
analysis of the proximal area of the Mlh1 promoter, a region expanding from
324 to 288 bp of the ***PENDING****Mlh1 promoter was amplified by
heminested PCR using the following conditions: unmethylated primers 5¶ACTACAATCCTACGCCGTCT-3¶ (sense), 5¶-TTCGACCGACTACAATCCTA-3¶
(antisense for first PCR), and 5¶-TTTAGTTTGGTGTCGGGTC-3¶ (antisense for
second PCR); methylated primers: 5¶-AACTACAATCCTACACCATCTTC-3¶
(sense), 5¶-ACTTCAACCAACTACAATCCTA-3¶ (antisense for first PCR), and
5¶-TTTTTAGTTTGGTGTTGGGTT-3¶ (antisense for second PCR). Bisulfitetreated DNA was subjected to nested PCR and subsequent sequence
verification. One microliter of the first PCR product was used as template for
the second PCR.
Semiquantitative real-time PCR. Real-time PCR was done using an
Applied Biosystems Step One Plus instrument using SYBR Green detection
reagents. Oligonucleotide sequences were as follows: murine MLH1

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (16). August 15, 2009

forward 5¶-GTTTTACTCCATTCGGAAGCAGT-3¶, murine MLH1 reverse
5¶-TGTGAGCGGAAGGCTTTATAGAT-3¶, murine PMS2 for ward
5¶-ACCTCACGCAGGTTGACTT-3¶, murine PMS2 reverse 5¶-AGTCGAGTCCCAACGCTTG -3¶, murine BNIP3 forward 5¶-CGAAGCGCACAGCTACTCTC3¶, murine BNIP3 reverse 5¶-GCCTTCCAATGTAGATCCCCAAG-3¶, murine
DEC-1 forward 5¶-TACAAGCTGGTGATTTGTCGG-3¶, and murine DEC-1
reverse 5¶-CTGGGAAGATTTCAGGTCCCG-3¶. Normalization was done
using murine RPA2 ( forward 5¶-ATACCCAGACAACAGAGGG-3¶ and reverse
5¶-GCCAGTCCGCTCAATCACC-3¶).
In vitro hypoxia treatment. Subconfluent cultures of YAMC cells
(a kind gift of Dr. Robert Whitehead) were grown in RPMI with 5% fetal
bovine serum, 100 ng/AL IFN-g, and 1 insulin/transferrin/selenium and
incubated in a Biospherix hypoxia chamber at 37jC in 1% O2 for 24 h and
total RNA was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR.
Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid treatment of GiA2 / mice.
Groups of 32- to 36-week-old Gia2 / mice (n = 4) were treated with
daily gavage feedings with a 5 mg/mL solution of suberoylanilide
hydroxamic acid (SAHA; Cayman Chemical) solubilized in PBS containing
a 5 molar excess of h-hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin (Sigma) for 7 days ( final
dose 50 mg/kg). Control animals received only cyclodextrin solution. Colons
were harvested and crypts isolated as described above and analyzed for
MLH1 expression by Western blot analysis.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation. Cells and crypts were cross-linked
in 1% formaldehyde for 10 min and then lysed in SDS lysis buffer and
sonicated to a fragment length of 300 to 1,000 bp. The sonicate was
precleared and the supernatant was incubated overnight at 4jC with the
following antibodies: anti-DEC-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; clone S-8) and
anti–acetyl histone H3 (Millipore). Rabbit IgG was used as a negative
control antibody. Following immunoprecipitation, washing, crosslink
reversal, and DNA cleanup, the proximal Mlh1 promoter region was
amplified for an optimized number of cycles using the following primers:
forward 5¶-GTTTAGAGCGGGACAGAGAT-3¶ and reverse 5¶-CCTGCTACAAACGCCATATT-3¶.
Histopathologic assessment of GiA2 / and SAHA-treated mice. The
severity of colitis and assessment of cancer histology for Gia2 / mice was
done as described previously (19).
Statistical analyses. For MSI analysis, statistically significant mutation
frequency differences between genomic DNA from different genotypes were
tested by Fisher’s exact test. Statistical significance was assessed using
Student’s paired t test for linear data and the Mann-Whitney U test for
nonlinear data.

Results
Previously, we detailed the natural history and histopathology of
Gia2 / colorectal cancer (19). We have now extended our
colorectal cancer analysis in a cohort (n = 47) of Gia2 / mice
(Table 1). Among Gia2 / mice sacrificed after age 20 weeks, 89.8%
had at least one colorectal cancer present, with a mean tumor
incidence of 1.89 colorectal cancers per mouse. In contrast, germline Mlh1 and Msh2 MMR-deficient mice rarely develop colonic
adenomas or colorectal cancer; <50% develop small intestine
adenomas by 12 months and only rarely develop colorectal cancer
(22). Gia2 / mice colorectal cancers were predominantly rightsided (75%). Like human MMR-deficient colorectal cancers, all
Gia2 / colorectal cancers were nonpolypoid and had a Crohn’s
like lymphocytic infiltrate. (See Supplementary Fig. S3 for a
histopathologic comparison of a Lynch syndrome colorectal cancer
versus Gia2 / colorectal cancer.) Mucinous colorectal cancers are
more common in MMR-deficient colorectal cancers (15-25%;
refs. 23–25) than sporadic colorectal cancer patients (5-10%).
Gia2 / tumors develop a higher rate of mucinous colorectal
cancers (29%) than has previously been reported in any mouse
model of colorectal cancer. In summary, Gia2 / colorectal cancer
are more similar to Lynch syndrome and sporadic MMR-deficient

colorectal cancer (26) than the existing MMR-deficient mouse
models (Supplementary Table S1) or MMR-proficient colorectal
cancer.
Acquired suppression of MLH1 and PMS2 protein in GiA2
knockout colon epithelium. Epigenetic silencing of MLH1 causes
the majority of sporadic MMR-defective colorectal cancer (27, 28).
Because Gia2 / colorectal cancer phenocopy Lynch syndrome
and sporadic MMR-deficient colorectal cancer, we stained colonic
epithelium from young versus old WT and Gia2 / mice for MMR
expression. Gia2 / colons from young (<6 weeks) mice have no
inflammation or colorectal cancer (19), and immunohistochemistry
performed on 8-week-old Gia2 / mice showed WT levels of MMR
proteins MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6 (Supplementary Fig. S1).
By age 40 weeks, immunohistochemistry of Gia2 / colitis and
colorectal cancer showed a consistent, marked reduction in MLH1
and PMS2 protein levels in inflamed and cancerous Gia2 /
mucosa (Supplementary Fig. S2) in both epithelium and fixed
stromal cells (F, J, G, and K). MLH1 expression was preserved in
infiltrating lymphocytes in the Gia2 / tissues (white boxed
region, F). PMS2 is an obligate heterodimeric partner of MLH1.
With MLH1 silencing, undimerized PMS2 protein becomes
unstable and is degraded (20). Expression of the MSH2 and
MSH6 MMR proteins is not affected by MLH1 silencing.
To confirm the immunohistochemical results, we quantified
MMR protein expression in purified epithelia from WT and
inflamed Gia2 / colons. In young mice, MMR protein expression
was unchanged (Fig. 1A, top). However, after 20 weeks, total crypt
MLH1 and PMS2 were markedly decreased in Gia2 / colonic
epithelial cells (Fig. 1 A, bottom). Consistent with the immunohistochemical result (Fig. 1S-H), MSH2 expression was unchanged.
To corroborate the acquired loss of MLH1 expression between
ages 8 and 20 weeks, quantitative PCR analysis of MLH1 expression
in 8- and 20-week-old Gia2 / crypt epithelium revealed normal
MLH1 expression at the early time point but a f75% drop in
MLH1 expression in inflamed 20-week-old Gia2 / crypts (Fig. 1B).
Gia2 / crypt PMS2 mRNA levels were not significantly different
from WT at either time point.
In summary, both immunohistochemistry and Western analysis
show that MLH1 and PMS2 protein levels are markedly reduced in
inflamed Gia2 / colon. This decrease is somatically acquired, as it
follows the onset of inflammation. MSH2 and MSH6 levels are not
affected. Mlh1 is transcriptionally repressed, whereas PMS2

reduction is post-translational likely in response to decreased
MLH1 protein levels.
MSI in inflamed GiA2 / mucosa. MMR-deficient colorectal
cancers include increased MSI and impaired DNA damage
response. Previously, we have shown hypomorphic MSI in
Mlh3 / and Pms2 / mice (because of redundancy between
Mlh3 and Pms2) and full-blown MSI in Mlh3 / ;Pms2 / mice,
indistinguishable from Mlh1 / mice (29). Using mouse microsatellite markers previously studied in other MMR-deficient mouse
models (16, 30), we performed MSI testing on laser capture–
microdissected Gia2 / tumor DNA and WT colon epithelium DNA.
Consistent with previous studies of both mouse and human, almost
all MSI was caused by mononucleotide repeat deletions that
shortened microsatellites (31). For each marker tested, Gia2 /
colorectal cancers had significantly increased MSI versus WT
(both P < 0.0001; Table 2). At the same time, young precolitic
Gia2 / colon showed no MSI (data not shown).
MLH1 promoter methylation is not increased in GiA2 /
mice. Epigenetic silencing of the proximal Mlh1 promoter by CpG
methylation is a common mechanism for sporadic MMR-deficient
colorectal cancer tumorigenesis (32). We therefore studied the
orthologous CpG island in the mouse Mlh1 promoter in Gia2 /
inflamed colon. Using bisulfite-treated WT and colitic Gia2 /
crypt genomic DNA, we observed no significant differences in the
intensity of methylated versus unmethylated PCR products
between WT colon and Gia2 / inflamed colon samples (Supplementary Fig. S4). Methylation of the proximal Mlh1 promoter does
not appear to contribute to epigenetic silencing of Mlh1 in Gia2 /
inflamed colons and colorectal cancer.
Inflamed GiA2 / colons and colorectal cancers are hypoxic.
The lack of promoter hypermethylation in the setting of suppressed
MLH1 expression led us to test other potential mechanisms shown
to silence Mlh1. In vitro studies have shown that hypoxia can repress

MLH1 mRNA expression in a HDAC-dependent manner (33).
Because other mouse models of colitis have been shown to have
mucosal hypoxia (34), we evaluated whether the Gia2 / inflamed
colon might be hypoxic and whether hypoxic repression of MLH1
might be occurring in vivo. DEC-1 and BNIP3 are well-characterized
markers of hypoxia (35, 36). First, we validated DEC-1 (37) and BNIP3
(38) as hypoxic markers in colonocytes by incubating YAMC cells
in vitro under hypoxia (1% O2) or normoxia for 24 h. Consistent with
previous studies in human colon cancer cell lines and other cells
types, exposure to hypoxic conditions resulted in a significant upregulation of BNIP3 (9.00 F 1.07–fold; P = 0.009) and DEC-1 (2.11 F
0.27–fold; P = 0.033) mRNA expression. Western analysis confirmed
proportional increases in DEC-1 and BNIP3 protein in hypoxic
YAMC cells (Fig. 2A), confirming that DEC-1 and BNIP3 are inducible
markers of hypoxia in mouse colonocytes. Next, we determined that
these hypoxia markers were up-regulated in vivo in colonocytes in
crypts from colitic Gia2 / mice compared with WT mice.
To show directly that Gia2 / inflamed colons are hypoxic, we
used EF5 (kindly provided by Dr. Cameron Koch), a wellcharacterized direct probe of tissue hypoxia (39). We injected
WT and colitic Gia2 / mice with EF5. Four hours after i.v.
injection, in WT colon tissues, the surface epithelium contains a

faint diffuse staining, difficult to capture in unenhanced immunofluorescence images (Fig. 2B, a). In contrast, in Gia2 / inflamed
colon, hypoxia is greatly increased in the surface epithelium and in
the deeper crypts in Gia2 / mice. Notably, hypoxia is particularly
prominent in areas with cancer and adjacent underlying stroma
(Fig. 2B, b and c). Treatment of the same cancer sample with
precompeted anti-EF5 abrogated staining (Fig. 2B, d). The
corresponding areas following hematoxylin counterstaining are
shown in Supplementary Fig. S6. The pattern of EF5 staining seen
in inflamed Gia2 / colons is similar to that seen in the mouse
model of TNBS colitis (34). In summary, DEC-1 and BNIP3 are
biomarkers of hypoxia in mouse colonocytes and in Gia2 /
inflamed colon epithelium. Furthermore, EF5 dye studies confirm
that, similar to TNBS-induced colitis, EF5 trapping in hypoxic
tissue is increased in Gia2 / inflamed colon.
Hypoxia modulates acetyl histone H3 levels and DEC-1
association with the proximal MLH1 promoter in vitro and
in vivo. Low levels of acetyl histone H3 are associated with
transcriptional silencing of many genes (40). Using chromatin
immunoprecipitation, we tested whether hypoxia decreases acetyl
histone H3 content at the proximal Mlh1 promoter in YAMC cells
and whether treatment with HDACi can increase acetyl histone H3

Figure 2. Inflamed Gia2 / crypts are hypoxic. A, YAMC
cells grown in 1% O2 (right ) up-regulate the hypoxia
markers DEC-1 and BNIP3, which are also up-regulated in
purified crypt lysates from colitic Gia2 / mice (left).

experiments. B, frozen sections from EF5-treated WT
and Gia2 / mice (age 20-27 wk) were stained with
Cy3-conjugated anti EF5. WT colon (a) had minimal
EF5 staining, whereas colitic Gia2 / mucosa (b) was
profoundly hypoxic in surface epithelium and in some
deeper crypt cells. EF5 staining of Gia2 / cancers (c )
was patchy and involved primarily malignant epithelial
cells and the adjacent stroma. As a negative control,
preadsorbed anti EF-5 (d ) revealed no staining.

levels. Figure 3A shows that hypoxia suppressed histone H3
acetylation at the proximal Mlh1 promoter, whereas pretreatment
with trichostatin A enhanced Mlh1 promoter histone H3 acetylation in hypoxic (as well as normoxic) culture conditions. This
indicates that hypoxia decreases acetyl histone H3 content at the
Mlh1 promoter in vitro, which can be rescued by HDACi treatment.
Consistent with other cell lines rendered hypoxic in vitro, hypoxia
suppresses MLH1 expression at the mRNA and protein level by
quantitative PCR and Western blot, respectively (data not shown).
Hypoxia is known to enhance DEC-1 binding to the proximal
Mlh1 promoter in cell culture, suppressing Mlh1 expression (41). We
performed chromatin immunoprecipitation on genomic DNA from
hypoxic YAMC cells and from colonic crypt epithelium from 28week-old WT and colitic Gia2 / mice and analyzed the proximal
murine Mlh1 promoter using oligos spanning this region. We
identified a marked increase in DEC-1 at the proximal Mlh1
promoter in hypoxic YAMC cells as well as Gia2 / crypts mice
in vivo (Fig. 3 B and C). Consistent with previous reports indicating
the ability of DEC-1 to bind HDAC1 (42), we also found an increase
in HDAC1 bound to the Mlh1 promoter in hypoxic YAMC cells. In
hypoxic YAMC cells and Gia2 / inflamed crypts, DEC-1 occupancy
at the proximal Mlh1 promoter is increased, as is HDAC1 binding
that may be responsible for decreased acetyl histone H3 levels.
HDACi relieve hypoxia, reduce inflammation, and normalize
MLH1 expression in GiA2 / colorectal cancers. Recent studies
have shown both anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic effects of
HDACi in mouse models of chronic colitis and colitis-associated
colorectal cancer (43, 44). These results suggest that chronic
inflammation alters histone acetylation in the inflamed colon, and
this epigenetic change may contribute to tumorigenesis. Because
HDACi have been shown to block hypoxia-induced MLH1 silencing
in vitro (33), we tested whether HDACi treatment could enhance
MLH expression in vivo. We gavage-fed groups of 33- to 36-week-old
Gia2 / mice with 50 mg/kg SAHA daily for 8 days and evaluated
MLH1 expression in crypt epithelium by Western blot and
quantitative PCR. SAHA caused a significant reduction in colitis
severity (Fig. 4A) using a previously published histologic activity
index (45). We found significant increases in MLH1 mRNA and
protein expression (Fig. 4B and C; Supplementary Fig. S5). Overall
acetyl histone H3 levels in SAHA-treated crypts were increased
(data not shown). By chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis,
SAHA treatment enhanced acetyl histone H3 levels and decreased

Discussion
Human MMR-deficient colorectal cancers have histopathologic
features that distinguish them from MMR-proficient sporadic
colorectal cancer (1), including right-sidedness, nonpolyposis and
mucinous histology, earlier age of onset, multifocality, a Crohn’slike lymphocytic infiltrate, and MSI (2, 3). Although multiple
germ-line MMR-deficient mouse models have been generated, a

persistent mystery is their very different histologic phenotype
versus that seen in human Lynch syndrome and MMR-deficient
sporadic colorectal cancer.
The histopathology of Gia2 / colorectal cancer is very similar to
Lynch syndrome and MMR-deficient sporadic colorectal cancer. We
speculate that the mechanism of inheritance of MMR deficiency
may explain these observations. When all mouse/human body
tissues are MMR-deficient, intestinal cells transform into cancers in
a MMR-deficient microenvironment in the absence of hypoxic
inflammation. This may enhance tumor growth in the tissues seen
in human and mouse biallelic germ-line MMR deficiency. When
hypoxic inflammation-induced MMR-deficient cells transform into
cancers surrounded by a partially MMR-proficient microniche
(given the hypomorphic MSI that we observe), tumor growth is
enhanced with the spectrum seen in Lynch syndrome, sporadic
MMR-deficient colorectal cancer, and Gia2 / mice. Determining
the relative importance of hypoxia-induced signaling versus
inflammation-derived mediators in MMR silencing is under way.
The MMR status of tumor microniche may also explain why
Mlh3 / mice (which are MMR-deficient hypomorphs) develop a
higher proportion of colorectal cancers versus small intestinal
adenomas than completely MMR-deficient mouse models (16),
albeit with overall lower intestinal cancer penetrance.
Gia2 / mice have somatically acquired MMR deficiency that
occurs in both inflamed and cancerous colon mucosa. This repression
of MMR activity is specific to the MutL homologues Mlh1 and
Pms2, as the MutS homologues Msh2 and Msh6 are not affected.
Consistent with this reduction in MLH1/PMS2 protein levels,
inflamed Gia2 / colorectal cancers have MSI. However, some
residual MLH1 protein remains. Therefore, Gia2 / mice have a
hypomorphic MSI phenotype. Hypomorphic MSI likely reflects two
factors: (a) decreased but not absent MLH1/PMS2 protein and (b)
MSI arises only in older mice after colon inflammation, so mouse
tissue is MMR-deficient for a shorter period. Together, these factors
would be expected to cause lower MSI frequencies compared with
germ-line MMR-deficient knockout mice. The same issue may also
explain why the impaired DNA damage response in Gia2 /
inflamed colon (19) is also not as dramatic as that seen in germ-line
MMR-deficient models (46). Studies using inducible Mlh1 knockouts showed that low-level MLH1 expression has f20% of the MSI
mutation rate compared with complete loss of MLH1 expression
and near-proficiency in cell extract–based single-base substitution
repair assays (47). Another example of hypomorphic MMR and MSI/
frameshift capacity was seen in studies with Pms2 / and Mlh3 /
mice. There is redundancy between Pms2 and Mlh3 in MSI/
frameshift repair. Loss of each of these genes individually causes
hypomorphic MSI, but together, Mlh3 / ;Pms2 / mice have ‘‘full’’
MSI that is indistinguishable from Mlh1 / mice. Because both
Mlh3 / and Pms2 / mice develop tumors, these data are
consistent with a mechanism whereby partial MMR loss causes
cancer susceptibility. The precise relationship between the degree of
MMR capacity and MSI rates is likely to depend on the cell lineage,
residual MMR capacity, and the specific repeat sequences analyzed
to quantify MSI mutation rates. Future studies that use genomewide assays of MSI mutation rates in MMR-proficient, hypomorphic, and deficient colon will be helpful to resolve the relationship
between MMR capacity, hypomorphic MMR, and MSI mutations in
colorectal cancer ‘‘driver’’ CAN genes and noncoding sequences
important for colorectal cancer tumorigenesis.
Hypermethylation of the proximal Mlh1 promoter is a wellestablished mechanism for MLH1 silencing in sporadic MMR-

deficient colorectal cancer (reviewed in ref. 48). In inflamed Gia2 /
crypt gDNA, we did not find increased methylation of the
orthologous sequence in the mouse proximal Mlh1 promoter
(Supplementary Fig. S4). We cannot, however, rule out that the
Mhl1 promoter is methylated in Gia2 / cancers. Future studies
treating Gia2 / mice with hypomethylating agents and assessing
the effect on tumorigenesis and Mlh1 silencing may be helpful to
address this issue.
Recently, tissue hypoxia has emerged as a mechanism of Mlh1
silencing and MMR deficiency in vitro but has not yet been shown
to occur in vivo. Using hypoxia biomarkers BNIP3, DEC-1, and EF5
(49), we show that Gia2 / inflamed colon has regional hypoxia,
likely resulting from the dense infiltrate of chronic inflammatory
cells, and increased metabolic activity in damaged/regenerating
epithelium. Hypoxia-induced epigenetic MLH1 silencing involves
up-regulation of the bHLH transcription factor DEC-1/Sharp2/
Stra13 via a hypoxia-inducible factor-1a response element in its
promoter (42). DEC-1 contains a NH2-terminal DNA-binding
domain that recognizes a CANNTG- E-box consensus sequence
in the proximal Mlh1 promoter (41) and a COOH-terminal
transactivation domain that binds the class 1 HDAC (42). In vitro,
DEC-1 expression inhibits MLH1 expression in a HDAC-dependent
manner (33, 41, 50), as HDACi prevent hypoxic DEC-1-mediated
MLH1 repression. Consistent with predictions based on in vitro
studies, we showed increased DEC-1 expression in inflamed
Gia2 / crypts (Fig. 2A) and increased DEC-1 occupancy at the
proximal Mlh1 promoter in vivo (Fig. 3C). Because colitis (and
hypoxia) is patchy, the DEC-1 Western and chromatin immunoprecipitation data likely underestimate the degree of hypoxiainduced DEC-1 expression and its binding to the Mlh1 promoter,
as both techniques assay all crypts isolated from a segment of
colon, not all of which is necessarily hypoxic. A model of epigenetic
Mlh1 silencing by hypoxia is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. S7.
Recent reports indicate that treatment with HDACi have antiinflammatory and antineoplastic effects in animal models of
inflammatory bowel disease and inflammatory bowel disease–
associated colorectal cancer. In dextran sulfate sodium and TNBS
colitis models, the HDACi VPA and SAHA dose-dependently
increase acetyl histone H3 in lamina propria mononuclear cells,
inhibit proinflammatory cytokines, and reduce colitis severity (43).
Another HDACi, ITF2357, can suppress inflammatory bowel
disease–associated colorectal cancer development in interleukin10 / and azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium–treated mice
apparently by lowering nuclear factor-nB activity and enhanced
apoptotic activity in lamina propria mononuclear cells (44).
Interestingly, the antineoplastic effect was only seen in the right
colon, suggesting differential sensitivity of right- and left-sided
colitis-associated colorectal cancers to HDACi. We found that daily
oral gavage with 50 mg/kg SAHA caused a significant decrease in
colitis and up-regulated MLH1 expression, suggesting that
decreased hypoxic inflammation results in increased reversal of
Mlh1 silencing via increased tissue oxygenation.
Chronic inflammation is a risk factor for colorectal cancer.
Although the suppressive effects of HDACi on nuclear factor-nB
activity and inflammation undoubtedly contribute to their chemopreventive effect in azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium and
interleukin-10 knockout mice, our studies indicate that the hypoxic
tissue microenvironment may also contribute to the development
of MSI via Mlh1 suppression and that HDACi treatment can reverse
Mlh1 silencing. Most importantly, in concert with previous work,
our studies provide additional preclinical mechanistic support that
