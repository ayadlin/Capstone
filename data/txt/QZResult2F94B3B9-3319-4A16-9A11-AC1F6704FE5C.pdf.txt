Hedgehog Pathway Inhibition

Abstract
Medulloblastoma is a cancer of the cerebellum, for which there is currently no approved targeted therapy.
Recent transcriptomics approaches have demonstrated that medulloblastoma is composed of molecularly
distinct subgroups, one of which is characterized by activation of the Hedgehog pathway, which in mouse
models is sufﬁcient to drive medulloblastoma development. There is thus considerable interest in targeting
the Hedgehog pathway for therapeutic beneﬁt in medulloblastoma, particularly given the recent approval of
the Hedgehog pathway inhibitor vismodegib for metastatic and locally advanced basal cell carcinoma. Like
other molecularly targeted therapies, however, there have been reports of acquired resistance to vismodegib,
driven by secondary Hedgehog pathway mutations and potentially by activation of the phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Given that acquired resistance to vismodegib may occur as a result of inappropriate
PI3K pathway activation, we asked if loss of the PI3K pathway regulator, phosphatase and tensin homologue
(Pten), which has been reported to occur in patients within the Hedgehog subgroup, would constitute a
mechanism of innate resistance to vismodegib in Hedgehog-driven medulloblastoma. We ﬁnd that Hedgehog
pathway inhibition successfully restrains growth of Pten-deﬁcient medulloblastoma in this mouse model, but
does not drive tumor regression, as it does in Pten-wild-type medulloblastoma. Combined inhibition of the
Hedgehog and PI3K pathways may lead to superior antitumor activity in PTEN-deﬁcient medulloblastoma in
the clinic. Cancer Res; 73(23); 7034–42. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor, and is the leading cause of cancer-related
mortality in childhood. Current available therapy consists of
surgery, radiation therapy of the brain and spinal cord,
followed by chemotherapy. Unfortunately, this aggressive
therapeutic strategy is associated with serious adverse
effects, including postoperative mutism, neurocognitive deficits, endocrinopathies, and increased susceptibility to secondary malignancies (1).
Recent transcriptional proﬁling has demonstrated that
medulloblastoma is composed of 4 molecularly distinct subgroups: the Wnt subgroup, Sonic Hedgehog subgroup, Group 3,
and Group 4 (2). The identiﬁcation of these subgroups provides
a much needed opportunity for the use of molecularly targeted
therapeutics in medulloblastoma, which have the potential to
both increase efﬁcacy and reduce side effects when compared
with the current standard of care. The Hedgehog subgroup,

which makes up approximately 25% of medulloblastoma cases
(3), may be particularly amenable to a targeted therapeutic
approach, given the recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration
approval of the Hedgehog pathway inhibitor, vismodegib
(previously known as GDC-0449), in metastatic and locally
advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC).
Hedgehog signaling is critical for embryonic development
and also plays a limited role in adult homeostasis. In the offstate, the transmembrane receptor Patched (PTCH) suppresses the activity of the GPCR-like molecule Smoothened
(SMO). The Hedgehog ligands (Sonic, Indian, or Desert Hedgehog) activate the pathway by binding to PTCH, which releases
its inhibition over SMO. SMO in turn signals to the GLI family of
transcription factors and thus induces a change in the transcriptional proﬁle of the cell (4). Inappropriate activation of the
pathway, most often caused by inactivating mutations in
PTCH, or activating mutations in SMO, is associated with
cancer, predominantly BCC and medulloblastoma (5–8).
Vismodegib binds to, and inhibits SMO, blocking
downstream Hedgehog pathway activation
In early-stage clinical studies, a patient with medulloblastoma from the Hedgehog subgroup harboring widespread
metastatic disease, exhibited rapid and dramatic tumor regression when treated with vismodegib (9). Unfortunately, the
robust initial response was followed by relapse, reminiscent
of the acquired resistance seen in the context of other targeted
therapies, such as erlotinib (10). Sequence analysis of a tumor

Hedgehog Pathway Inhibition in PTEN-Deﬁcient Medulloblastoma

biopsy obtained after progression in this patient indentiﬁed an
amino acid substitution at a conserved residue of SMO. The
D473H substitution disrupts the ability of vismodegib to bind
SMO, but does not alter the ability of SMO to activate the
Hedgehog pathway (11). This observation triggered a series of
investigations into potential alternative mechanisms of resistance against vismodegib and sonidegib, another Hedgehog
pathway inhibitor currently under clinical development (12). A
variety of resistance mechanisms were identiﬁed through the
use of mouse models, including additional mutations in Smo,
as well as downstream Hedgehog pathway alterations such as
Gli2 ampliﬁcation (11, 13, 14). An additional, and unexpected
potential mechanism of acquired resistance to sonidegib was
the upregulation of PI3K signaling (13).
The PI3K pathway is a well-established oncogenic pathway
that regulates cell growth, proliferation, and survival by relaying growth factor signaling (15). Aberrant activation of the
PI3K pathway occurs in multiple tumor types and is frequently
driven by disruptions in the negative pathway regulator PTEN,
but can also be driven by gain-of-function mutations in
PIK3CA. A recent genomic analysis of medulloblastoma tumors
revealed that of 13 Hedgehog subgroup patients proﬁled, 2 had
loss-of-function mutations in PTEN, and another patient
had an activating mutation in PIK3CA (16). Of 66 patients
proﬁled from the other subgroups, none had loss of PTEN, and
2 had mutations in PIK3CA. Another sequencing study similarly found a number of PTEN mutations in medulloblastoma
tumors, one of which co-occurred with a homozygous PTCH
mutation (17). In addition to genomic alterations as a mechanism to hyperactivate the PI3K pathway, epigenetic inactivation of PTEN has been reported to occur at a high frequency
in medulloblastoma samples (18). Given that inappropriate
activation of PI3K signaling may represent a potential mechanism of acquired resistance to Hedgehog pathway inhibitors,
we wanted to determine if preexisting PTEN mutations, which
occur in Hedgehog subgroup patients, would alter the initial
response to vismodegib in Hedgehog-driven medulloblastoma.

Materials and Methods
Mouse models
Math1CreER and Ptenloxp mouse strains were both obtained
from The Jackson Laboratory (stock numbers 007684 and
004597, respectively), and the Ptchloxp strain was a kind gift
from R. Toftgard and S. Teglund (Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden; ref. 19). All mice were housed and maintained
according to the animal-use guidelines of Genentech, conforming to California State legal and ethical practices. Credependent recombination was induced by oral gavage of
tamoxifen (single dose of 4 mg in sunﬂower seed oil) to
pregnant dams at E14.5.
Tissue analysis
Tumors were harvested from moribund animals and subject
either to overnight ﬁxation in 4% paraformaldehyde before
embedding in parafﬁn, or to lysis in CelLytic MT Lysis reagent
(Sigma). Immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunoﬂuorescence,
and Western blotting were carried out according to standard
procedures. Antibodies used were as follows: mouse anti-NeuN

www.aacrjournals.org

(1:500 for immunoﬂuorescence and 1:1000 for Western blotting;
Millipore, #MAB377), rabbit anti-Ki67 (1:300; Thermo Scientiﬁc,
#RM9106), rabbit anti-pAKT S473 (1:500 for IHC and 1:1000 for
Western blotting; Cell Signaling Technology, #4060), rabbit
anti-pS6 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, #4858), rabbit
anti-PTEN (1:100 for IHC and 1:1000 for Western blotting; Cell
Signaling Technology, #9188), and rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3
(1:100 for IHC; Cell Signaling Technology, #9661). The DAKO
Envisionþ horseradish peroxidase (DAB) system was used to
detect primary antibodies for IHC. Images were acquired using
a Zeiss Axioskop2 plus microscope ﬁtted with an AxioCam HRc
or a Leica DMI4000B ﬂuorescence microscope. Adobe Photoshop CS3 was used to process images, and Fiji was used to
quantify cleaved caspase-3 staining.
Generation of medulloblastoma allografts and drug
treatments
To enable an assessment of the sensitivity of these medulloblastoma models to inhibition of the Hedgehog and PI3K
pathways, tumor growth was relocated subcutaneously via
grafting. The cerebella of mice displaying symptoms associated with medulloblastoma were harvested and prepared for
subcutaneous inoculation into the right lateral thorax of
female CD1-nude (CRL) mice aged at least 6 weeks, to
establish passage 1. Allografts were generated via inoculation
of a single cell suspension in 100 mL Neuralbasal Medium
(Invitrogen; PM model, derived from Ptchloxp/loxp; Math1CreER
mice) or small tumor fragments (PPM model, derived from
Ptchloxp/loxp; Ptenloxp/loxp; Math1CreER mice). Serial in vivo propagation of the PPM model was repeated to generate sufﬁcient
tumor-bearing animals for drug treatment. Tumors were
measured with calipers, and tumor volumes calculated using
the formula v ¼ 0.5  length  width2, where length and
width represent perpendicular tumor diameters. As tumors
reached 100 mm3, tumor-bearing animals were separated into
groups of similarly sized tumors and drug administration was
initiated.
Compounds were formulated in 0.5% methylcellulose/0.2%
Tween 80 (MCT) and mice were administered either vehicle or
drug once daily (qd) by oral gavage; vismodegib and GNE-317
treatments were separated by 4 hours. To generate samples for
pharmacodynamic analysis (quantitative PCR and Western
blotting), tumor-bearing mice were treated for 3 consecutive
days, and tumors were harvested 4 hours after the ﬁnal dose.
Statistical methods
A mixed modeling approach was used to analyze the repeated measurement of tumor volumes from the same animals over
time (20). This approach addresses both repeated measurements and modest dropouts before study end. Restricted cubic
splines were used to ﬁt a nonlinear proﬁle to the time courses
of log2(tumor volume) in each group. Fitting was done via a
linear mixed effects model, using the R package nlme, version
3.1 97 in R version 2.12.0 (R Development Core Team 2008; R
Foundation for Statistical Computing).
Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) as a percentage of vehicle
control (%TGI) was calculated as the percentage of the area
under the ﬁtted tumor volume–time curve (AUC) on the linear

scale for the respective treatment group per day in relation to
the starting volume on Day 0 (baseline) and in relation to the
vehicle. As such, a TGI value of 100% indicates tumor stasis; a
TGI value of >1% but <100% indicates tumor growth delay; and
a TGI value of >100% indicates tumor regression and would be
associated with a negative AUC.
To determine uncertainty intervals (UI) for %TGI, the
ﬁtted curve and the ﬁtted covariance matrix were used to
generate a random sample as an approximation to the
distribution of %TGI. The random sample is composed of
1,000 simulated realizations of the ﬁtted mixed model, in
which the %TGI is recalculated for each realization. Our
reported UI is the value for which 95% of the time the
recalculated values of %TGI will fall in this region given the
ﬁtted model. The 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of the simulated
distribution were used as the upper and lower UIs, respectively. All TGI values were calculated at day 13 of the
experiment, to allow for direct comparison across the two
models; TGI cannot be calculated beyond day 13 in the PPM
model as control/vehicle-treated tumor-bearing animals
were euthanized before the end of the study, because tumor
volumes exceeded 2,000 mm3.

Results
Loss of PTEN accelerates the onset of morbidity in a
mouse model of Hedgehog-driven medulloblastoma
An earlier study showed that deletion of Ptch in cerebellar
granule neural precursor cells (CGNP), which was achieved by
crossing Math1CreER mice to Ptchloxp/loxp mice, resulted in the
development of medulloblastoma, with 100% penetrance (21).
For our studies, we combined this model with the previously
described Ptenloxp/loxp mouse allele to generate Ptchloxp/loxp;
Ptenloxp/loxp; Math1CreER compound mutants (22). Similar to
the previous report, Ptchloxp/loxp; Math1CreER (hereafter referred
to as PM) mice (induced with tamoxifen at E14.5) display signs
of illness during early adulthood (6–10 weeks), which include a
domed head and abnormal gait. Strikingly, loss of Pten in
Ptchloxp/loxp; Ptenloxp/loxp; Math1CreER (referred to as PPM) mice
dramatically accelerates disease, with animals as young as 3
weeks of age presenting with ataxia; the median survival is 9.3
weeks in PM versus 4.0 weeks in PPM mice. Ptchloxp/loxp;
Ptenwt/loxp; Math1CreER (PPwt/loxpM) littermates have an intermediate survival, with a median of 7.4 weeks (Fig. 1A). Importantly, loss of Pten alone in this model is not sufﬁcient to
initiate observable disease, as Ptchwt/wt; Ptenloxp/loxp; Math1CreER
mice survive long term with no symptoms.
Analysis of brain samples from PM and PPM mice
revealed very large tumors within the cerebellum, which
disrupt the normal cerebellar architecture (Fig. 1B–D). Histologically, tumors from PM mice resemble classic medulloblastoma, which is the histological subtype that predominates among human patients from the Hedgehog subgroup;
these are frequently described as "small round blue-cell"
tumors (Fig. 1C). In contrast, tumors from PPM mice have a
markedly different appearance, with a histological phenotype analogous to medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity (MBEN), which in humans, is a histological subtype
thought to be restricted to Hedgehog subgroup patients

Hedgehog Pathway Inhibition in PTEN-Deﬁcient Medulloblastoma

Activation of PI3K signaling drives medulloblastoma
cells toward a more differentiated phenotype
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed additional differences between PM and PPM tumors. PM tumors are largely
made up of undifferentiated cells, positive for Ki67 and negative for the neuronal marker NeuN (Fig. 2A, see also Supplementary Fig. S3 for phospho-histone H3 IHC). Somewhat
counterintuitively, the more aggressive PPM tumors have a
high content of differentiated cells, positive for NeuN and
negative for Ki67, with Ki67þ cells occurring sporadically
within the tumor mass. Strikingly, in medulloblastoma tumors
that are either Ptenloxp/loxp or Ptenloxp/wt, in addition to scattered
Ki67 positive cells, we also ﬁnd regions of Ki67þ/NeuN cells
that occur as "stripes" (Fig. 2B, and Supplementary Fig. S3 for

pH3 IHC). These proliferative stripes seem to localize to
perivascular regions (see Fig. 2C, inset), an observation that
was conﬁrmed by EdU/CD31 double staining, in tumors harvested 2 hours after administration of the thymine analog (Fig.
2D). PM tumors have a relatively high level of baseline apoptosis, as revealed by the presence of cleaved caspase-3
(CC3), which seemed to be markedly reduced in PPM tumors
(Fig. 2E and F). We used image analysis to quantify this
apparent difference, taking into account the observation that
in any ﬁeld of view there seem to be more cells in the PM model
than in the PPM model, and found that indeed, apoptosis is
signiﬁcantly suppressed in the PPM model (Fig. 2G, see also
Supplementary Fig. S4 for an illustration how the image
analysis was conducted).

Loss of PTEN in Hedgehog-driven medulloblastoma
alters the response of tumors to vismodegib
The early onset of tumors in the PM and PPM models, the
very rapid onset of morbidity of the PPM model in particular,
and the lack of normal cerebellar tissue in this model, which
would be required to maintain cerebellar functionality after
targeting the tumor, prevented us from performing a vismodegib intervention study in the autochthonous setting. Fortunately however, the value and relevance of allograft studies in
the context of medulloblastoma have previously been well
established (11, 13, 14). Therefore, to evaluate the response of
PM and PPM tumors to vismodegib, we generated allograft
models; tumors harvested from PM and PPM animals were
passaged subcutaneously in nude mice. This allowed tracking
of tumor volumes over time, in response to various doses of
drug (see also Materials and Methods). Although the histological characteristics distinguishing primary PM and PPM
tumors do not seem to be strictly maintained in the allograft
setting, key features, such as PTEN status and pAKT levels (Fig.
3A and B), are maintained. Note the loss of PTEN in PPM tumor
cells, but not in stromal cells, consistent with the restriction of
cre-recombinase activity to Math1-expressing neural progenitors. As expected, loss of PTEN is associated with robust
upregulation of pAKT. In addition, PPM allografts seem to
retain a somewhat more differentiated phenotype when compared with PM allografts, with apparent increases in NeuN
levels (Fig. 3C), although the differentiation phenotype is less
dramatic in the allografts when compared with the primary
tumor.
Oral gavage of mice with 3 mg/kg vismodegib qd has little
effect on allograft growth, in either model, despite having a
modest effect on Hedgehog pathway activity (Fig. 4A, B, and D).
This ﬁnding, that 50% Hedgehog pathway inhibition is not
sufﬁcient to drive a tumor response, is consistent with the
recent demonstration that sustained and robust inhibition of
the Hedgehog pathway (>80%) is required for a meaningful

antitumor effect (23). In contrast, 30 mg/kg vismodegib qd is
sufﬁcient to cause a meaningful growth delay in both models,
with a mean TGI of 90% in the PM model, and 70% in the PPM
model (Fig. 4A–C).
Interestingly, the response to vismodegib seems to diverge
between the models at higher doses of vismodegib. In the PM
model, vismodegib dosed at 60 and 90 mg/kg qd results in rapid
and robust tumor regression, with 149% and 159% mean TGI,
respectively; tumors continued to regress beyond day 13, and
were barely detectable at day 21, when the study ended (Fig. 4A
and C). In contrast, PPM tumors had not regressed by day 13,
on either 60 or 90 mg/kg vismodegib, with a mean TGI of less
than 100% in both cases (87% and 90%); rather, these doses
achieved tumor stasis by the end of the study, despite a
comparable level of Hedgehog pathway inhibition (Fig. 4D).
Combined PI3K and Hedgehog pathway inhibition drives
tumor regression in the PPM model
GNE-317 is a PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitor that was
speciﬁcally designed to cross the blood–brain barrier, with
the treatment of PI3K pathway-driven glioblastoma as the
primary objective (24). We made use of this previously
described compound to ask if inhibition of the Hedgehog
pathway in combination with inhibition of PI3K signaling,
would improve on vismodegib as a single agent. GNE-317
when dosed at 30 mg/kg qd successfully attenuates PI3K
signaling in the allograft setting, as measured by pS6 levels
(Fig. 5A), and by pAKT levels (Supplementary Fig. S5), but
does not alter levels of Hedgehog pathway activity (Fig. 4D).
Similarly, 90 mg/kg vismodegib does not inﬂuence activation
of the PI3K pathway in this setting (Supplementary Fig. 5).
GNE-317, as a single agent, achieved modest inhibition of
tumor growth in the PM model, and a more meaningful
inhibition of growth in the PPM model (mean TGI 37% and
66%, respectively; Fig. 5B–D). In the PPM model, although
vismodegib treatment alone did not drive regression at any

concentration tested, GNE-317 treatment, when combined
with either 60 or 90 mg/kg vismodegib, resulted in tumor
regression (Fig. 5B and D). At 60 mg/kg vismodegib plus
GNE-317, mean tumor volume at the study start was 232
mm3, which regressed to 152 mm3 on day 13 and 100 mm3 by
the study endpoint. At 90 mg/kg vismodegib plus GNE-317,
mean tumor volume at the study start was 244 mm3, which
regressed to 102 mm3 on day 13 and 80 mm3 by the study
end. It is also worth noting that the regression driven by the
combination of GNE-317 plus 90 mg/kg vismodegib is highly
consistent across individual tumors/animals (Fig. 5D).

Discussion
Inherited mutations in PI3K signaling components are
associated with human syndromes that include neurological
abnormalities, such as Lhermitte–Duclos disease, indicating
that this pathway is important in normal neural development
and/or function (25). Indeed, 2 independent mouse studies
described the use of GfapCre to delete Pten in the brain, and
showed that this led to lethal neurological defects including
seizures and ataxia, which were coupled to an enlargement of
the cerebellum (25, 26). Histological analysis revealed the

www.aacrjournals.org

presence of ectopic, enlarged cells at the pial surface and
within the molecular layer of the cerebellum, which was
attributed to a migration defect in mutant cells. Histologically,
this phenomenon is very similar to the phenotype seen in
Ptchwt/wt; Ptenloxp/loxp; Math1CreER mice, although the mice
described here do not display any overt clinical symptoms,
potentially because of incomplete deletion of PTEN driven by
the Math1CreER (Supplementary Fig. S2). A more recent study
demonstrated that postnatal deletion of PTEN in migrating
neuroblasts in the rostral migratory stream resulted in ectopic
positioning and altered morphology of neurons. The authors
argue that the migration defect associated with PTEN loss was
likely secondary to precocious differentiation, rather than a
defect in the mechanics of directional migration (27). The
highly differentiated nature of the tumors in PPM mice
described here, as well as NeuN expression in ectopic cells in
the cerebella of Ptchwt/wt; Ptenloxp/loxp; Math1CreER mice, supports the notion that loss of PTEN may drive precocious/
premature differentiation in neurons, although the presence of
PTEN-deﬁcient neurons within the inner granule layer (IGL)
argues against a migration defect of these cells. Perhaps most
relevant, the RCAS/tv-a system, which allows postnatal gene
transfer in a cell-type-speciﬁc manner, was used to generate

medulloblastoma by targeting SHH to nestin-expressing neural
stem cells, either in the presence or absence of PTEN (28).
Intriguingly, PTEN-deﬁcient tumors were described as having
MBEN histology, with high levels of NeuN, very similar to the
PPM model described here. Moreover, the perivascular niche of
these tumors was described as being highly proliferative, "in
fact the only proliferative region in the tumors," again, very
similar to the PPM model described here. We propose that
these proliferative cells in the perivascular niche are major
contributors to tumor growth. A different study, using a
constitutively active mutant of Smo, SmoA1, to induce medulloblastoma in Ptenþ/ mice similarly demonstrated that activation of PI3K signaling accelerated tumorigenesis while driving a switch from classic to MBEN histology, and concomitantly increased neuronal differentiation (29). Notably though,
although there is a clear relationship between hyperactivation
of the PI3K pathway and MBEN histology that is recapitulated
in a number of different mouse studies, it remains to be
established if the same relationship exists in human patients.
That activation of PI3K signaling can simultaneously promote differentiation while also accelerating tumorigenesis is
somewhat surprising; differentiated tumors are generally associated with slower growth and a better prognosis. Intriguingly

though, blocking apoptosis in a SmoA1 model of medulloblastoma, by deleting proapoptotic Bax resulted in a very similar
phenotype: a paradoxical increase in differentiation coupled to
acceleration of disease (30). Strikingly, SmoA1; Bax/ tumors
seem indistinguishable from the PPM tumors described here
(see Fig. 5, Garcia et al.). The authors propose a model in which
medulloblastoma cells face a cell fate choice between apoptosis and differentiation; those cells that are competent to
undergo apoptosis will do so and will thus be lost from the
tumor, resulting in tumor turnover. In contrast, cells incapable
of launching an apoptotic program will adopt a terminally
differentiated fate, leading to the accumulation of differentiated cells. The differentiated, nonapoptotic, and aggressive
phenotype of the PPM model described here, together with the
established role of PI3K signaling in promoting cell survival, is
in line with this fate choice model.
Despite the profound changes that occur in PTEN-deﬁcient
tumors with respect to PTEN wild-type tumors, PPM allografts
are responsive to vismodegib: inhibition of the Hedgehog
pathway restrains tumor growth and results in stasis, suggesting that even in the context of PTEN loss, tumors remain highly
dependent on Hedgehog pathway activity for growth. Truly
resistant tumors, for example allografts that harbor the mouse

Hedgehog Pathway Inhibition in PTEN-Deﬁcient Medulloblastoma

equivalent of the patient-derived SMO D473H mutation
described above, continue to grow robustly in the presence
of 75 mg/kg vismodegib (11). Importantly then, although
hyperactivation of PI3K signaling prevents regression of
tumors in response to Hedgehog pathway inhibition, it does
not confer bona ﬁde resistance. Nevertheless, the distinction
between stasis and regression is of critical importance, and
raises a key question: how is regression driven by Hedgehog
pathway inhibition in the PM model, and how is this altered by
the loss of Pten? Another open question relates to the durability
of the drug response in these models; speciﬁcally how the
durability is inﬂuenced by the lack of regression in vismodegibtreated Pten mutant tumors. It is likely that in the absence of
complete regression, discontinuation of drug treatment will
lead to immediate reinitiation of tumor growth, as occurs in
Ptchþ/; p53/ allograft tumors (11).
Our ﬁndings have signiﬁcant implications for the clinical
development of Hedgehog pathway inhibitors in medulloblastoma, which are currently ongoing (see clinicaltrials.gov, and
refs. 31–33) for descriptions of Hedgehog pathway inhibitors
currently under clinical development). In the case of BCC, for
which vismodegib is now approved, the vast majority of tumors
display alterations in the Hedgehog pathway, and there is no
current requirement for the stratiﬁcation of patients. However,
the additional genomic complexity seen in patients with
medulloblastoma means that it will be critical to preselect
the 25% of patients who are deﬁned as the Hedgehog
subgroup. Based on the data described here, we now argue
that it will also be important to monitor PI3K pathway status
during patient selection, particularly in cases where a positive
clinical trial outcome is deﬁned by regression, rather than
stasis. The diagnostic strategy, which will enable the selection
of patients who may respond to Hedgehog pathway inhibitors

as a single agent, versus those who might beneﬁt from a
combined regime of a Hedgehog pathway inhibitor plus a
brain penetrant PI3K inhibitor, will require careful consideration, given that PI3K pathway alterations in medulloblastoma
have been reported not only at the genomic, but also at the
epigenetic level (16, 18). It will also be critical to determine if
and how other alterations that have been reported to occur in
the Hedgehog subgroup, such as N-myc ampliﬁcation, will alter
the response of Hedgehog-driven medulloblastoma to Hedgehog pathway inhibition.
