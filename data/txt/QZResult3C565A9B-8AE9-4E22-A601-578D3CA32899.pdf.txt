ABSTRACT
Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 C22 natural fatty acid serving as a
precursor for metabolic and biochemical pathways, was reported as a targeting ligand
of anticancer drugs. However, its tumor targeting ability and mechanism has not been
claimed. Here we hypothesized that the uptake of DHA by tumor cells is related to the
phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) contents in cell membranes. Thus, in this manuscript,
the tumor-targeting ability of DHA was initially demonstrated in vitro and in vivo on
different tumor cell lines by labeling DHA with fluorescence dyes. Subsequently, the
tumor targeting ability was then correlated with the contents of PE in cell membranes
to study the uptake mechanism. Further, DHA was conjugated with anticancer drug
gemcitabine (DHA-GEM) for targeted tumor therapy. Our results demonstrated
that DHA exhibited high tumor targeting ability and PE is the main mediator, which
confirmed our hypothesis. The DHA-GEM displayed enhanced therapeutic efficacy
than that of GEM itself, indicating that DHA is a promising ligand for tumor targeted
therapy.

INTRODUCTION

membrane, generating free oxygen radicals and lipid
peroxidation [11-18]. Due to the increased tumor
membrane transportation and its relatively anticancer
activity DHA has been conjugated with anti-tumor drugs
to increase therapeutic efficacies. For example, DHApaclitaxel, which is currently under phase 3 clinical study,
has showed less toxicity, higher tumor accumulation
concentration, higher anti-tumor efficacy compared to
the paclitaxel [19-26]. DHA-Doxorubicin is significantly
more efficacious than free Dox, with an increased uptake
of DHA-Dox by tumors and an increased half-life in the
body [27].
However, the reason for the high concentration of
DHA in tumor cells was not clearly elucidated. Teague
et al reported that a DHA-fluorescent probe was highly
uptaken by EL4 cells at 37°C than at 23°C, which could
be attributed to the high fluidity of the cell membrane at

Cancer has been known as the second leading cause
of death in the world due to the late diagnosis and lack of
the specificity of most chemotherapeutic drugs [1-2]. Thus
earlier diagnosis and targeted therapy are the main focus
of the researchers nowadays. The tumor targeting ligands
play a crucial role in the development of tumor contrast
agents and targeted anticancer drugs. [3-10]
Docosahexaenoicacid (DHA), an omega-3 C22
natural fatty acid with six cis double bonds, is a precursor
for metabolic and biochemical pathways. Studies have
circumstantiated that DHA has the activity of inhibiting
several kinds of cancer cells. Various mechanisms of its
anticancer activity were proposed such as modulating
the cellular proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation,
increasing drug transportation across the tumor cell

37°C, while it is more ordered at 23°C [28]. Robinson
et al found that DHA was initially incorporated into
phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) accompanied by a
less amounts into phosphatidylcholine (PC) or other
phospholipid classes [29-30]. Liu et al found that PE had
higher expression in gastric cancer cells than that in the
normal gastric mucosa [31].Based on these reports, we
hereby hypothesize that the high accumulation of DHA
in tumor cells is directly related with the PE contents in
cell membrane. As Christopher Stubbs reported that PE
and other phospholipid had a positive correlation to the
fluidity of cell membrane [30]. The amount of PE could be
reflected by the fluidity of cell membrane. In this study, we
will measure the fluidity of cell membrane to investigate
the correlation of tumor targeting ability of DHA with the
PE contents in cell membrane.
Optical imaging has been gaining a lot of interest,
especially near infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging for its
obvious advantages as a non-invasive technique for in vivo
real time monitoring or tracing biological information and
signals in small animals. In this study, a near infrared dye
Cypate will be conjugated to DHA to form a fluorescence

probe for investigating the tumor targeting ability of DHA
in different tumor lines.
Gemcitabine (GEM) hydrochloride (HCl) is
approved for the treatment of a wide spectrum of solid
tumors. But its use is limited by its short half-life, toxic
and side effects as well as drug resistance [32]. The
modification of GEM with DHA may improve the tumor
targeting ability and the anticancer efficacy. Thus, we will
synthesize a brand new antitumor prodrug by covalently
conjugating DHA with gemcitabine to strengthen its antitumor activity and reduce the drug dosage to reduce its
toxicity.

Investigation of the uptake mechanism

DHA was reacted with the NHS ester of Cypate. In the
process, the intermediate product containing -COCl
group was obtained from the chemical reaction between
SOCl2 and –COOH. Then, the reaction between -COCl
group and NH2NH2 resulted in the intermediate product
(amino modified DHA). In order to enhance the reaction
efficiency, excess SOCl2 and NH2NH2 were used to allow
sufficient reactions. The reaction of amino modified DHA
and Cypate was carried out after the intermediate product
was verified by MS analysis. NHS and EDCI served as
catalysts in this reaction with a molar ratio to Cypate
of 3:3:1. To improve the reaction efficacy, the catalysis
system and feed ratios of different components were
optimized and verified by the step-by-step Tcl evaluation.
The crude product DHA-Cypate was subsequently
purified by silica gel column. The purified product
was characterized, as shown in Fig. 1. The maximum
absorption wavelengths of DHA-Cypate were matched
exactly with that of free DHA and Cypate at 270 nm and
780 nm respectively, indicating the successful conjugation
of DHA and Cypate (Fig. 1B). Fluorescence spectra in
Fig. 1C exhibited the same fluorescence peak of DHACypate (red) and Cypate (black) at 810 nm, implying
that the conjugation of DHA with Cypate did not affect
the fluorescence of Cypate. The MS analysis in Fig. 1D
displayed that the molecular weight of DHA-Cypate is
949.6, the sum of DHA (328.5), Cypate (625), NH2NH2.
HCL(70) subtracting two molecular H2O (32), further
confirm the successful conjugation of DHA-Cypate.

To further study the tumor targeting mechanism
of DHA, we designed an in vitro DHA blocking and PE
competition binding experiment. As shown in Fig. 2C,
cells incubated with DHA-RhB and cells in PE competition
binding group both had stronger intracellular fluorescence
intensity than that of the cells in DHA blocking group.
DHA-RhB was rarely up-taken by the cells in the DHA
blocking group, while in the PE competition binding
group, DHA-RhB was highly presented intracellular. The
blocking experiments indicated that the binding of DHA
with PE plays key role in the cellular uptake. PE is one
of the components within the phospholipid bilayer of cell
membranes. When free DHA was incubated with the cells,
the DHA was preferentially bound with PE to form DHAPE compound and entered the cells afterwards. Therefore,
as a large number of PE was initially occupied by free
DHA, the added DHA-RhB probe would be blocked
outside the cell membrane, resulting in the low cellular
uptake (Fig. 2C). In contrast, in the PE competition
binding DHA group, free DHA and free PE were added
simultaneously into the medium prior to DHA-PE
binding, allowing the PE in the cell membrane remained
unoccupied. Thus, the added DHA-RhB had the chance to
combine with unoccupied PE in the cell membranes and
enter the cells in large quantity (Fig.2C). All the results
indicated that PE contents in the cellular membrane was a
major component for the cellular uptake of DHA.

In vitro cell targeting and uptake mechanism of
DHA based probes

The fluidity of cell membrane
To confirm our hypothesis, PE contents in the cell
membranes of different cell lines were determined. Since
the exact measurement of PE amount in cell membrane
is very difficult, we determined the amount of PE based
on the previous reports that a positive correlation between
the fluidity of the cell membrane and the PE within
phospholipids existed [30]. Fluidity itself is inversely
proportion to the viscosity which can be easily measured.
Tumor cells (MCF-7 and HepG2) and normal liver cells
(L02) were used for the fluidity measurements. As shown
in Fig. 3A, the fluidity deduced from the measured
fluorescence polarization is in the order of MCF-7>HepG2>L02, implying that the amount of PE within the cellular
membranes follows the same order, MCF-7>HepG2>L02. The membrane fluidity of L02 cells was much
lower than that of the tumor cells. In addition, HepG-2
cells had a lower fluidity compared to MCF-7cells. In our
previous cellular uptake study (Fig. 2A-2B), DHA-based
probe had a higher accumulation in MCF-7 than that of
HepG-2. Weak signal was observed in the normal L02
cells. The cellular uptake of DHA-based probe displayed
close relationship with the PE contents. To correlate the
targeting ability of DHA-based probe with the PE contents

Cell targeting by DHA-based probes
Tumor cellular uptake of DHA-based probes was
determined by confocal microscopy. Visible fluorescence
dye RhB was used to replace Cypate in the probe. As
shown in Fig. 2A, the fluorescence in the cells incubated
with the DHA based probe displayed higher intensity
than that of free RhB itself in all the cell lines. More
importantly, the fluorescence in MCF-7 cells incubated
with DHA-RhB exhibited brighter fluorescence (means
higher emission intensity) than that of HepG-2 cells.
The normal cells L02 displayed weakest fluorescence
signal even incubated with DHA-RhB. The quantitative
analysis was plotted in Fig. 2B. The fluorescence intensity
decreased in the order of MCF7>HepG2>L02. These
results indicated that DHA-based probe has higher uptake
by tumor cells, with better targeting ability in MCF-7 cells
than that of HepG-2 cells.

in tumor cell membrane, the cell uptake ratios was
plotted against viscosity in Fig. 3B. A linear correlation
(R2=0.924) between cell uptake and T/N and viscosity
was obtained, which further confirmed our hypothesis.
Above results support our proposed mechanism that
DHA entering cells is related to the PE contents in the
cell membranes. As tumor cells have higher PE contents,
DHA based probe exhibits better tumor targeting ability.

h postinjection and gradually enters the liver and clear
through the enterohepatic metabolism pathway after
24 hours circulation. Since Cypate and DHA share the
same hydrophobic nature, the DHA-Cypate conjugate
follows hepatic and intestinal metabolism, with initial
biodistribution overall the body and slowly cleared from
liver and intestines. The ex vivo imaging of main organs in
Fig.4C confirmed the enterohepatic pathway, with bright
fluorescence signals in liver and intestine. It indicated that
when the probe was administrated into the blood stream,
it would firstly arrive at liver by the blood circulation and
then transferred to the intestine through bile duct, and
gradually clear out of the body through the feces. The
fluorescence was indeed observed in the feces( data did
not show here). Weak fluorescence was observed in kidney
DHA-Cypate showed longer circulation time in mice,
which could be attributed to the stronger hydrophobicity
of DHA-Cypate compared to Cypate alone. Most
importantly, 4 hours post injection of DHA-Cypate, the
tumor sites were obviously identifiable in both MCF-7
and HepG-2 bearing mice. The fluorescence intensity in
tumor sites reached maxima at about 6 h post injection
and maintained up to 24 h and then slowly faded away.
Further, the fluorescence signals in MCF-7 tumor site
were much brighter than those in HepG-2 tumor site at
all the time points. Tumor to normal tissue contrast ratios
were quantified and plotted in Fig. 4B. As shown, the
ratio maximized in 6 h for both MCF-7 and HepG-2 mice
models. The maximal T/N ratio of MCF-7 mice model
(T/N = 6.5) was obviously higher than that of HepG2 mice model (T/N = 5.3), which is consistent with the
results from in vitro cellular uptake (Fig. 2B). Our results
showed that DHA-based probe had excellent ability to
target tumor cells of high PE contents.
To furtherstudy the targeting mechanism of DHA,
NIR fluorescence images of the DHA blocked group
and PE competition binding group were obtained. For

Cytotoxicity of DHA based probes
MCF-7 breast tumor cell line, HepG-2 liver tumor
cell line and L02 normal liver cell line were treated with
different concentrations of DHA-based probe(Cypate)
(from 1.0 to 20 nM/L) for 24 h, and then cell viability
was evaluated by MTT assay (Fig. supplementary 1). The
tumor cells treated with DHA-Cypate have not exhibited
distinct anti-proliferative activities as its concentration
increased. However the cell viability of HepG-2 cells
after incubation with DHA-Cypate was clearly higher than
MCF-7 cells. This phenomenon may be correlated with the
quantity difference of PE expression in different cell lines.
It also predicts tumor killing effect of DHA in some cells
along with its targeting activity.

Tumor targeting ability in tumor bearing mice
In order to evaluate the in vivo tumor-targeting
ability of the DHA based probe, the near infrared dye,
Cypate, was labeled with (or linked to) DHA to form
DHA-Cypate probe. MCF-7 and HepG-2 tumor-bearing
mice tail vein injected with the probe were monitored
by NIR fluorescence imaging system at different time
intervals (0.5 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 12 h and 24 h). As
shown in Fig. 4A, Cypate itself did not exhibit the
tumor targeting ability. It spread over all the body at 0.5

Antitumor efficacy of DHA-GEM

DHA blocked group, no obvious fluorescence signal was
observed in the tumor sites of the MCF-7 and HepG-2
tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 4A), while strong fluorescence
signal was found in the PE recovered group (the signal
intensity was same with DHA-Cypate group, data not
shown).
The results of in vivo DHA blocking and PE
competition binding experiments were consistent with that
of the in vitro blocking experiment, reconfirming the role
of PE in DHA uptake by tumor cells.

Synthesis and characterization of DHA-GEM
Severe toxic side effects and short half-life time
are the main defects limiting the clinical application
of gemcitabine. Targeted delivery and hydrophobic
modification of gemcitabine may reduce the side effects

and prolong its circulation for enhanced accumulation in
the tumor. DHA was covalently conjugated to the inactive
group N4-position of gemcitabine to increase its targeting
activity, thus enhancing the drug efficacy and reducing the
adverse effect.
The synthetic scheme for DHA-GEM is shown in
Fig. 5A. In the reaction system, ethylchlorocarbonate
played an important role similar to a catalyst and THF
altered the pH, ensuring the continuity of the reaction
and boosting the speed and efficacy. The relatively pure
target compound DHA-GEM was obtained with silica gel
column chromatography.
The molecular weight of DHA-GEM characterized
by mass spectrometry is 573.7 (Fig. 5B), which is
the sum of one DHA (328.5) and one gemcitabine
(263.2), subtracting one water (18). The MS spectrum
demonstrated the successful synthesis of DHA-GEM.

tumor cell lines, as shown in Fig. supplementary 2. For
comparison, the toxicity of DHA itself was investigated
using MCF-7, HepG-2 and H22 cells (Fig. 7A, Fig.
supplementary 2, Fig. 6A). The results showed that
DHA within the dosage range of 0-100 μmol/L had no
identifiable cytotoxicity on these tumor cells. However,
when the amount of DHA reached 100 μmol/L, obvious
cytotoxic effects were observed. Thus, the dosage
of DHA was designed within the nontoxicity range
(<100μmol/L) for all other in vitro experiments. Compared
to gemcitabine alone, DHA-GEM displayed better
therapeutic efficacy in all the tumor cells, including MCF7(Fig. 6A), H22(Fig. 7A), HepG-2, A549, 7402, MDAMB-231, 7901 (Fig. supplementary 2), demonstrating
an impressive killing ability against tumor cells. Within
the therapeutic window, more DHA-GEM (compare with
gemcitabine) was uptaken by tumor cell, rendering high
drug concentration. As a consequence, the toxic effects of
GEM on normal cells could be reduced due to its reduced
dosage in DHA-GEM. This result was consistent with our
in vitro and in vivo targeting results, demonstrating that
DHA was a promising ligand for tumor targeted therapy.

In vitro antitumor activity of DHA-GEM
The in vitro cell experiments were conducted to
determine the therapeutic effect of DHA-GEM in different

In vivo antitumor therapeutic efficacy of DHAGEM

DHA-GEM and free gemcitabine groups were 60% and
50%, respectively, whereas in the control group all the
mice were dead on the 14th day (Fig. 6E).
After nine days administration, main organs (heart,
liver and kidney) from the three groups (5/group) were
collected for histological examination(Fig. 6F).The major
organs, were observed in gemcitabine group and DHAGEM group.In the liver group, we found that it had no
obvious pathological changes both in the saline and
gemcitabine groups, but a little in the DHA-GEM group.
It is because that the modification with DHA has changed
the metabolism of gemcitabine and has a slightly damage
to the liver. In the kidney group, both gemcitabine and
DHA-GEM groups have a little pathological damage.
However the gemcitabine group is more seriously than
the DHA-GEM group. It confirmed that conjugation with
DHA could reduce the kidney toxicity of gemcitabine and
decrease the side effects. For the hearts, no pathological
changes occurred in both DHA-GEM group and the
controlled group. On the contrary, pathological changes
were observed in free gemcitabine group. While
examination of tumor tissues in DHA-GEM group
revealed pronounced pathological changes. Similarly, the

In vivo antitumor efficacy of DHA-GEM was
evaluated on H22 tumors -bearing Kunming mice and
MCF-7 tumor-bearing nude mice. In the Kunming mice
group, as shown in Fig. 6B, the tumors in the control
group grew faster than that in the free gemcitabine and
DHA-GEM treated mice. As expected, the tumor volume
in DHA-GEM treated group showed less increase that of
gemcitabine group. Finally, the tumor tissues at 9 days
post injection of different treatments were exercised
and weighted in Fig. 6C, with tumor inhibition rate of
70.1% for DHA-GEM and 58.6% for free gemcitabine.
Obviously, DHA-GEM possessed higher therapeutic effect
than that of free gemcitabine.
To compare the systemic toxicity, the body weight
of subjected Kunming mice was recorded every other day
and plotted in Fig. 6D. Steady but small weight increase
could be observed in the mice of Saline and DHA-GEM
groups, indicating the nontoxicity of DHA-GEM. The

antitumor efficacy of DHA-GEM was also investigated on
the MCF-7 tumor bearing nude mice. As shown in Fig. 7B
, the tumor volume indicated that DHA-GEM exhibited
high tumor inhibition ratio than gemcitabine. By the same
way, in the nude mice group, the tumor weight at 25th day
was plotted in Fig. 7C, with tumor inhibition rate of 55.6%
for DHA-GEM and 38.3% for free gemcitabine suggesting
that the antitumor efficacy of DHA-GEM is better than
free gemcitabine again. The body weight of subjected
nude mice were plotted in Fig. 7D, also indicating the
nontoxicity of DHA-GEM. It was concluded from above
data that DHA-GEM demonstrated lower toxicity in
normal organs and higher tumor killing ability than those
of gemcitabine, though there were no obvious survival rate
differences between the two groups.

Cellular uptake of DHA and its correlation with PE
contents

(Mean absorbance of untreated wells – Mean absorbance
of medium control well) × 100%.

Firstly, free DHA was incubated with the tumor
cells (MCF-7, HepG-2) for 30 minutes, followed by the
addition of DHA-RhB probe and incubation for another
hour. The fluorescence was observed under Laser confocal
microscopy. Secondly, the same dose of DHA and PE
were simultaneously added in the same tumor cell lines in
another group and incubated for 30 minutes, followed by
the addition of DHA-RhB for continuous 1h to study the
function of PE in the cellular uptake of DHA.
Thirdly, the PE contents in cell membrane were
determined to study its correlation with cellular uptake.
Because the direct determination of PE contents is
complicated, the viscosity of cell membrane was measured
to indirectly reflect the PE contents. Briefly, the tumor
cells in logarithmic phase were incubated with DPH
fluorescence solution for 30 minutes to allow enough DPH
to insert into the cell membrane. The cells were washed
again with DPS solution and suspended in 4ml PBS
solution. The fluorescence intensities of IVV and IVH were
detected by Fluorospectro-photometer to calculate the
fluorescent polarization P, with excitation wavelength at
362nm and emission wavelength at 432nm. The P formula
is described in the following:
P=(IVV-IVH)/(IVV+IVH),here,IVV
presents
the
fluorescence intensities when polarization and analysis
of polarized plate are placed in a vertical position and
IVH is the fluorescence intensities when polarization of
polarized plate is placed in a vertical position but analysis
of polarized plate is in a horizontal position. The viscosity
of cell membrane was calculated as: η=2P/(0.46-P)
Finally, the cell uptake of DHA was correlated with
PE contents.

Tumor-targeting ability of DHA-Cypate in tumorbearing mice
Tumor model
Athymic nude mice (nu/nu, age 4–6 weeks and
weight 18–22 g) were purchased from Charles River
Laboratories (Shanghai, China). All animal experiments
were carried out in compliance with the Animal
Management Rules of the Ministry of Health of the
People’s Republic of China (document NO. 55, 2001) and
the guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
of China Pharmaceutical University.
In this study, MCF-7 and HepG-2 tumor models
were used to investigate the in vivo targeting ability of
the probe. Briefly, a suspension of ~5×106 cancer cells
(MCF-7 or HepG-2) in 100 μL phosphate buffered saline
(PBS, 0.01 mol/L; pH=7.2) were subcutaneously injected
into the axillary fossa of each mouse. When the tumors
reached 0.4~0.6 cm in diameter, the tumor bearing mice
were studied in vivo (n = 5 for each imaging probe or dye).
Tumor targeting ability assay
To evaluate the tumor-targeting capability of DHACypate, 0.2 mL DHA-Cypate (2 nmol) (polyoxyethylene
castor oil and absolute ethanol (1:1) were used as cosolvents to dissolve in the saline)was intravenously
injected into MCF-7 and HepG-2 tumor-bearing mice,
respectively, when the primary tumors reached a size
of 0.4 to 0.6 cm in diameter. Near infrared fluorescence
imaging of the tumor-bearing mice was acquired at
designated time points of 0.5h, 2h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 12h, 24h.
Background images were taken for each mouse
prior to probe injection. In addition, for quantifying the
fluorescence of probe biodistributions in the mice body,
the tumor/normal tissue ratio (T/N ratio) was analyzed
and compared using the ROI function of the analysis. The
subjected mice were sacrificed 24 hours post injection
and the main organs were separated for NIR imaging to
confirm the bio distribution of the probe.
To verify the mechanism of DHA for tumor targeting
ability, free DHA and combination of free DHA with PE
were respectively administrated into the tumor bearing
mice in other different mice groups for comparison. The
procedures were same as above mentioned. Data were
expressed as a means ± SD (n =5).

Cytotoxic assay
The human cell lines MCF-7 (breast cancer cells),
HepG-2 (liver cancer cells) and L02 (liver normal cells)
were purchased from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA). Cells were cultured in a
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C in DMEM and
RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, 100 μg/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin.
DHA cytotoxicity was evaluated using cell viability
assay. MCF-7 and HepG-2 cells were seeded in a 96-well
plate (1×104 cells/well). After cultivation for 24 h, DHACypate (DMSO dissolve first,then added it into the cell
culture medium)of different concentrations were added
into the wells (n = 6) and incubated for 48 h. Then stock
solution of MTT (20 μl; 5 mg/ml) was added into each
well. After 4h incubation at 37 °C, the MTT solution was
replaced with 150 μl DMSO in each well. The absorbance
in each well was measured at 570 nm with a multi-well
plate reader. Cell viability was calculated using the
following formula: Cell viability = (Mean absorbance of
test wells – Mean absorbance of medium control wells) /

Antitumor efficacy of DHA-GEM
To explore the potential application of DHA as a
tumor targeting ligand, a novel antitumor drug, DHAGEM, was constructed by conjugating the DHA with the
anticancer drug GEM. The therapeutic efficacies of DHAGEM were investigated in vitro and in vivo.

last day at the time of sacrifice. The Kunming mice group
survival rates were recorded.

DHA-GEM was synthesized based on the literature
[35], by conjugating N4-amino group of GEM with
conjugated DHA. Briefly, DHA (0.54g), triethylamine
(TEA, 280μl) were dissolved in a tetrahydrofuran
(THF, 20mL) solution and then were added in a threeneck round-bottomed flask and cooled down to -10°C.
Afterwards, ethylchlorocarbonate (0.2g) was added
dropwise to the above THF solution mixture under
Nitrogen atmosphere and was continuously stirred at
-15°C for 30 min. Then gemcitabine hydrochloride (0.5g)
and triethylamine (TEA, 280μL) were dissolved in the
anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF) solution. Finally,
the DMF solution was added dropwise to the THF reaction
mixture under stirring at the same temperature for 30 min.
Later on, it was stirred for 72h at room temperature. After
the reaction, the mixture was concentrated in vacuum. The
crude product was purified to get the yellow solid product
(0.42g, 45% yield) by using silica gel chromatography
eluting gradually with 2% methanol in dichloromethane
(0.42g, 45% yield). Q-TOF Micro Mass Spectrometer
(Waters) was used to confirm the successful synthesis of
DHA-GEM.

Histology examination
To further investigate the side effects of DHA-GEM
on various organs of the treated mice, histological analysis
of different organs was conducted by using the established
technique.

Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as mean ± SD. Statistical
analysis was conducted by using Students t test with
statistical significance assigned for P value less than 0.05.

CONCLUSION
In our study we synthesized DHA-based NIR
probes for the first time, and then showed the probes
have a high in vivo and in vitro affinity to the tumor cells.
We showed that PE had a close connection with tumor
targeting mechanism of DHA. We have also synthesized
a novel antitumor drug DHA-GEM. Our results showed
that DHA-GEM had high efficacy and less toxicity than
the free gemcitabine. This study proved that DHA, a
naturally available nontoxic substance, is a good candidate
for conjugation with the antitumor drugs to increase their
efficacy and specificity. Furthermore, the fluorescent
emission of DHA can be used for tumor diagnosis.

In vitro cytotoxicity evaluation
The cytotoxicity of DHA, gemcitabine and DHAGEM were evaluated on MCF-7 , HepG-2 and H22
(mouse hepatoma cancer)tumor cells. To study the broad
spectrum of DHA-GEM, other five kinds of tumor cells
[A549 (lung cancer), 7402 (liver cancer), MB-MDA-231
(breast cancer), 7901 (gastric cancer)] were used to
investigate the cytotoxicity of gemcitabine and DHAGEM.

The human breast tumor cells MCF-7 and mouse
hepatoma tumor cells H22 were subcutaneously injected
into the upper right axillary fossa in the nude mice or
Kunming mice (Charles River Laboratories) respectively.
The H22 tumor cell implanted-Kunming mice were
randomly assigned into 3 groups (n=10 per group). In 24
hours post-inoculation, saline solution (0.9%), gemcitabine
solution (dissolved in saline, 40mg/kg equivalent to
gemcitabine), and DHA-GEM solution (castor oil solution
dissolved in diluted 1:1 with ethanol 50% v/v, 40mg/kg
equivalent to gemcitabine) were administrated into the
different group of mice on the days 1,4 and 7 via tail vein
for the study of antitumor efficacy. Similarly, the MCF-7
bearing nude mice were also divided into 3 groups (n=6)
and treated on the days 8,12,16,20 post-inoculation by
using the same procedures as Kunming mice, with dose
of 25mg/kg equivalent to gemcitabine. The therapeutic
efficacies were assessed by measuring tumor volume and
body weight every other day till the 9th day (Kunming
mice-bearing H22 group)or 24th day (nude mice-bearing
MCF-7 group).The tumor weight was measured in the
