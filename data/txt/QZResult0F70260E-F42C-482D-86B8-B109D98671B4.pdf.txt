ABSTRACT
Activation of cancer stem cell signaling is central to acquired resistance to
therapy in esophageal cancer (EC). ABT-263, a potent Bcl-2 family inhibitor, is active
against many tumor types. However, effect of ABT-263 on EC cells and their resistant
counterparts are unknown. Here we report that ABT-263 inhibited cell proliferation
and induced apoptosis in human EC cells and their chemo-resistant counterparts.
The combination of ABT-263 with 5-FU had synergistic lethal effects and amplified
apoptosis that does not depend fully on its inhibition of BCL-2 family proteins in
EC cells. To further explore the novel mechanisms of ABT-263, proteomic array
(RPPAs) were performed and gene set enriched analysis demonstrated that ABT263 suppresses the expression of many oncogenes including genes that govern
stemness pathways. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence further confirmed
reduction in protein expression and transcription in Wnt/β-catenin and YAP/SOX9
axes. Furthermore, ABT263 strongly suppresses cancer stem cell properties in EC cells
and the combination of ABT-263 and 5-FU significantly reduced tumor growth in vivo
and suppresses the expression of stemness genes. Thus, our findings demonstrated a
novel mechanism of ABT-263 antitumor effect in EC and indicating that combination
of ABT-263 with cytotoxic drugs is worthy of pursuit in patients with EC.

overexpression of Bcl-2 family proteins is associated with
tumor maintenance, metastatic progression, and therapy
resistance [5, 6]. Accordingly, Bcl-2 family proteins can
also act as the diagnostic and prognostic markers, but
especially, as novel therapeutic targets [7, 8].
ABT-263, a new BH3 mimetic, is a potent Bcl-2
family inhibitor that antagonizes Bcl-2 family members
(Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bcl-w) [9]. It was found safe and
effective against some leukemia, lymphoma, small cell
lung cancer, and other malignancies [10–14]. Nevertheless,
in some xenograft models of aggressive lymphoma and in
phase I/II clinic studies in patients of lung cancer, singleagent of ABT-263 just exhibited modest or limited efficacy
[10, 11, 15] with dose-dependent thrombocytopenia

INTRODUCTION
Esophageal carcinoma (EC) is a lethal disease
with high incidence globally, and the incidence has been
increasing in recent years [1]. Generally, the localized
EC is treated with chemo-radiation therapy plus surgery,
however, > 70% of patients have residual cancer in the
surgical specimen and their prognosis remains poor [2–4].
This inherent resistance in EC is most likely due to the
heterogeneity in the genetic makeup and large number of
DNA alterations. The results from the current therapies
are often devastating to the patient and family. In depth
understanding of molecular oncology could improve
therapeutic approaches. Many studies have indicated that

induced by targeting Bcl-xL in megakaryocytes [10, 16].
Recently, the studies are focused on the combination
of ABT-263 with cytotoxics. Ackler et al. found that

peutic regimens in hematologic tumors [14]. The study

act cooperatively to kill lymphoma cells in vitro and
in vivo [17]. However, the effects of ABT-263 and in
combination of chemotherapy and its mechanism of action
have not been explored in EC.
Many studies suggest that a small subpopulation of
cancer stem cells (CSCs) has the capacity to repopulate
tumors and drive malignant progression and mediate
radio- and chemoresistance [18]. Dysregulation of CSC
signaling like Hippo/YAP1, Wnt/β-catenin, and hedgehog
(Hh) have been implicated in the maintenance of tumor
and in conferring therapy resistance [19–22]. We have
previously reported that Hh pathway is often up-regulated
in EC and mediates therapy resistance [23–25]. Yesassociated protein (YAP-1) is the downstream effector
of the Hippo signaling pathway, which is frequently
overexpressed in many types of cancers [26, 27]. Our
recent studies have identified YAP-1 is a major inducer of
CSC properties in non-tumorigenic cells as well as in EC
cells by direct up-regulation of SOX9. Thus, the YAP-1SOX9 axis could be an important therapeutic target in EC
[20, 28]. Further, we also observed that YAP-1 mediates
constitutive and acquired treatment resistance in EC cells
[22]. Therefore, an agent that can block YAP-1/SOX9
expression or activity will be important in improving
patient outcome.
5-FU is an old anti-cancer agent [29] and it is
used frequently against EC [3, 29]. It has, however,
limited cytotoxic activity [30–33]. However, if 5-FU can
synergize with a targeted agent, it could provide a unique
advantage. Thus we explored the effects of ABT-263 alone
or combined with 5-FU on a variety of EC cell lines and
demonstrated that ABT-263 with 5-FU synergistically
enhances the sensitivity and bolsters apoptosis in EC cells
and their therapy resistant counterparts. In addition, novel
mechanisms of action of ABT-263 with cytotoxics on EC
cells were explored.

Chemo-resistance is a major problem in clinical
management and overcome chemo-resistance will improve
the clinical outcome. Thus, two chemo-resistant cell lines
SK4-Rf and Yes-6-Rf were established as described in the
Materials & Methods. Next, we sought to determine if
ABT-263 can overcome chemo-resistance. As expected,
ABT-263 (1 μM) in combination with 5-FU (10 μM)
strongly inhibited chemo-resistant cells as well as chemosensitive cells; while the single agent, either 5-FU (10 μM)
or ABT-263 (1 μM), has minimal effects on these cells
(Figure 1D and 1E). This implies that ABT-263 increases
the sensitivity of EC resistant cells to 5-FU.

ABT-263 induces apoptosis that is strongly
enhanced by 5-FU in EC cells
To determine whether the growth inhibition
observed in EC cells is associated with specific changes
in cell cycle distribution, we analyzed the cell cycle
using DNA flow cytometry. When SKGT-4, KATO-III,
and YES-6 cells were treated with 5-FU, ABT-263, or in
combination as indicated dosage for 48 hours, cell cycle
phase distributions were analyzed. Results in Figure 2A
and 2B show that 5-FU induced cells arrest in S-phase
and ABT-263 induced cells in sub-G1 phase. However, the
combination of ABT-263 and 5-FU resulted in significant
increase in sub-G1 phase (apoptosis) indicating that ABT263 promotes apoptosis in tumor cells arrested in S-phase
(containing DNA damage).
To further examine if ABT-263 induces apoptosis in
EC cells, we treated SKGT-4, Yes-6 and KATO-TN EC
cells with ABT-263, 5-FU, or combination. We observed
increase in apoptosis in 2–10 fold by ABT-263 treatment
alone. The induction of apoptosis by ABT-263 was
significantly amplified by the addition of 5-FU (Figure
3A). Accordingly, cleaved PARP level was strongly
increased in the combination treatment group (Figure 3B
and 3C top panel) in both SKGT-4 and JHESO EC cells.
However, the levels of anti-apoptotic machinery members
(BCL-2, BCL-XL and MCL-1) were not dramatically
affected (Figure 3B and 3C and Supplementary Figure S1)
indicating the strong tumor cell inhibition and induction
of apoptosis in EC cells by ABT263 may be due to other
mechanisms in addition to its canonical anti-BCL2 family.

RESULTS
ABT-263 inhibits EC cell growth and synergizes
with 5-FU on both sensitive and resistant EC
cells
To determine if ABT-263 has potential therapeutic
value in EC cell lines, four EC adeno (EAC) cell lines
(FLO-1, SKGT-4, BE3 and OE33) and two squamous
(ESCC) cell lines (YES-6 and KATO-TN) were treated
with ABT-263 at different doses. As indicated in Figures
1A and 2B, ABT263 inhibits both EAC and ESCC cell
growth in a dose dependent manner. In relatively low
concentrations (<1 μM), ABT263 effectively inhibited
cell growth in all cell lines. Most interestingly, when
ABT-263 combined with 5-FU, the inhibitory effect was
significantly enhanced in six EC cell lines (Figure 1C and
Supplementary Figure S3) indicating the synergy between
ABT263 and 5-FU.

EC cells treated with ABT-263 (1 μM) for 48 hours. Gene
set enriched analysis (GSEA) conducted by a specialized
bioinformatician (B.L), demonstrated that many genes

Hippo signaling in addition of down-regulation of BCL-2,
the major target of ABT-263 (Figure 4A). The quantitative
analysis showed a decrease in PI3K/mTOR, survival and
stemness signaling (Figure 4B), but the pro-apoptosis and
tumor suppressive molecules were up-regulated in ABT263 treated cells (Figure 4C). Using quantitative realtime PCR, we have confirmed that ABT-263 significantly
suppress many important genes that control oncogenic
signaling and stemness pathway such as β-catenin;
YAP-1, C-MYC and MCL-1 (Figure 4D).

As stated earlier, ABT-263 was very effective
in inhibiting EC cell growth and induced apoptosis
especially in combination with 5-FU that is not fully
dependent on BCL-2 family proteins (Figure 3). Since
stemness pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin and Hippo
coactivator YAP-1/SOX9 are central mediators of CSC
population maintenance and over growth; and Hippo
pathway YAP-1 also mediates anti-apoptotic protein
expression and transcription and therapy resistance

[34–36]. To further confirm if ABT263 affects CSC
signaling, a series of experiments were performed.
Results in Figure 5A show that protein levels of β-catenin,
its target cyclinD1 and YAP-1 and its target SOX9
decreased in a dose dependent manner when treated with
ABT-263 alone (Figure 5A) and the combination with
5-FU. Immunofluorescence (Figure 5C) further confirmed
the expression levels of these proteins were decreased
by ABT263. To further examine if stemness activity is
affected, the SuperTop TCF4 luciferase reporter that
reflects the Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity in cells [37]
were transfected into SKGT-4 cells and treated with
ABT263 at different dosage. Wnt/β-catenin activity
decreased in a dose dependent manner with ABT263
exposed for 48 hours. Similarly, co-transfection of

and were also dose dependent. These data suggest that a
novel mechanism of action of ABT263 is on inhibition of
stemness pathways-Wnt/β-catenin and YAP-1/SOX9 axis.

by doxycycline is shown in the Figure 6F (inset). Similar
results were observed in KATO-TN YAP-1 induced cells.
This indicates that ABT263 and its combination with 5-FU
preferentially inhibits YAP-1 high cell growth due to the
suppression of the YAP-1/SOX9 axis.

proliferation and apoptosis, as confirmed by the increased
cleaved PARP proteins by western blot analysis. However,
the effect of ABT263 did not fully depend on its canonical
targets BCL-2, BCL-XL and BCL-w, since EC cells we
tested have either low BCL-2 or no BCL-2 expression
(Figure 3B) and BCL-2 expression is often low or absent
in EAC tissues and cell lines [41]. Therefore, the observed
strong inhibitory effect by ABT263 with 5-FU, especially
on EC resistant cells, is likely due to novel mechanism
that has not been described.
To explore the potential novel mechanisms of ABT263 action, we employed RPPA to evaluate 175 proteins
expression on JHESO EC cells treated by ABT-263.
GSEA analysis our RPPA results show that CSC stemness
pathways and PI3K/mTOR pathways were inhibited,
while proapoptosis and tumor suppressive genes were
induced by ABT-263. More impressively CSCs have
the capacity to repopulate tumors and drive malignant
progression and mediate radio- and chemoresistance [18]
and dysregulation of CSC signaling like Hippo/YAP1,
Wnt/β-catenin have been implicated in the maintenance of
CSC population and confers therapy resistance [21, 23].
YAP-1 is frequently overexpressed in many types of cancers
and mediates constitutive and acquired treatment resistance
in EAC cells [36, 42, 43]. In this study, we identified for
the first time that ABT263 suppress nuclear expression of
YAP-1 and its target SOX9; and inhibits their transcription
activity as shown by transfection of YAP-1 and SOX9
promoter activity. Most importantly, ABT-263 alone or in
combination of 5-FU demonstrated strong inhibitory effect
on expression of YAP-1 and SOX9 in vivo xenografts.
Similarly, ABT263 was able to decrease β-catenin and its
target CyclinD1 expression and their activity reflected by
Super-TOP activity. Most importantly, ABT263 reduced CSC
population and tumor sphere formation. We show that ABT263 could reduce the CSC population, as noted ABT263
preferentially inhibits ALDH1 positive EC cells tumor sphere
formation and decrease the proportion of ALDH1 positive
cell population. It is reported that ALDH1, YAP-1/SOX-9
and β-Catenin, as reliable CSC markers (35–40) are either
associated with resistance or mediate resistance. Our study
showed that ABT-263 with 5-FU strongly inhibits ALDH1
positive EAC cell growth (Figure 6E). Further, when EC
cells have high levels of YAP1 expression by doxycycline
induction (DOX+), the combination treatment of ABT-263
and 5-FU significantly inhibits induced YAP1 high EC cell
growth in vitro. This indicates that ABT-263 strongly induces
EC cells apoptosis and sensitizes cells to 5-FU through
targeting CSC population by inhibiting both YAP-1/SOX9
axis and Wnt/β-catenin signaling.
In conclusion, our data show that ABT-263 can induce
apoptosis, inhibit EC cell growth, and overcome resistance
in EC cells. However, this effect is greatly amplified in
combination with 5-FU. The synergistic effects of ABT263 and 5-FU rely on inhibiting CSC signaling components
mainly on YAP-1/SOX9 axis and Wnt/β-catenin signaling

Strong antitumor effect of ABT-263 in
combination of 5-FU is through suppression of
CSC genes (YAP-1/SOX9) in vivo
Nude mice bearing JHESO cell xenografts were
divided randomly into 4 groups and then treated with control
(PBS), ABT-263 alone, 5-FU alone and in combination as
described in Materials & Methods. At the end of three week
dosing schedule, xenograft weight and volume and mice
body weight were measured (Figure 7A–7D). Results from in
vivo experiments demonstrated that mice treated with ABT263 greatly reduced tumor volume and weight in vivo, while
the mice treated with ABT-263 in combination with 5-FU,
the significant reduction of tumor weights and tumor volumes
were observed compared with 5-FU alone (Figure 7A and
7B), while mice body weights did not change significantly. In
addition, the level of YAP1, SOX9 and proliferation marker
KI67 in mice tumors was dramatically diminished by the
combination treatment of ABT-263 and 5-FU (Figure 7E).
Thus, ABT-263 in combination of 5-FU has strong antitumor
effects in vivo and these effects are, at least in part, due to the
inhibition of CSC genes-YAP1 and SOX9.

DISCUSSION
EC clearly presents numerous challenges in the clinic.
The degree of patient benefit is limited even after many
years of research. New therapeutic targets are needed to
improve patient outcome. Our novel data demonstrate that
small molecules like ABT-263 are promising and need to be
pursued in the clinic. In this study, we show that ABT-263
in combination with 5-FU strongly induces apoptosis and
enhances sensitivity to both EAC as well as ESCC; most
importantly the combination is lethal to chemo-resistant
cells by targeting CSCs population through inhibiting Wnt/
β-catenin and or YAP-1/SOX9 axes.
EC cell lines and their resistant counterparts when
treated with ABT-263, 5-FU, or both demonstrated that
there was some dose-dependent effect of single drugs;
but combination considerably reduced cell viability
by enhancing apoptosis. 5-FU acting as a thymidylate
synthase (TS) inhibitor induces cell arrest in the S-phase
and then initiates apoptosis [29], but ABT-263 initiates
apoptosis by targeting BCL-2 family proteins through by
mimicking the BH3 domain [11]. We confirmed that 5-FU
induced cells arrested in S-phase, while in combination
with ABT-263, ABT263 propel the S-phase arrested cells
induced by 5-FU into apoptosis. ABT-263 with 5-FU at
the low dosage had synergetic inhibitory effect on cell

with ALDH1 antibody. The ALDH1 positive (ALDH1+)
or negative (ALDH1-) cells were sorted by fluorescenceactivated cell sorting according to the ALDEFLUOR
detection kit [40]. ALDEFLUOR/DEAB treated cells were
used to define negative gates. FACS was performed with
>1 × 106 cells using the BD FACSCanto II or FACSAria
(Becton Dickinson, NC).

The human esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) cell
lines BE3, SKGT-4 (SK4), JHESO have been previously
described [31, 39]. The human esophageal squamous cell
carcinoma (ESCC) cell lines Yes-6 and KATO-TN were
kindly provided by Dr. Health Skinner (UT M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center). To establish 5-FU-resistant subclones, Yes6 and SKGT-4 parent EC cells were cultured with various
concentrations of 5-FU for 3–5 weeks, and the surviving cells
were collected. This collection procedure was repeated four
times. The establishment of these 5-FU-resistant subclones
took 3–6 months and newly derived 5-FU-resistant clones,
designated as Yes-6-Rf and SK4-Rf. These cells were
authorized and re-characterized in the characterized cell
line core facility of UT MD Anderson Cancer Center every
6 months. ABT-263 was obtained from Calbiochem (San
Diego, CA). 5-FU was from Sigma (Saint Louis, MO).
Antibodies β-catenin, MCL-1, BCL2, BCL-XL and PARP
were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). SOX9
was purchased from Chemicon (Millipore, Billerica, MA).

Tumor sphere formation assay
Sphere culture was performed as previously
described [20]. Briefly, FACS-isolated ALDH1+ or
ALDH1- cell populations (1000/well) were seeded
in triplicate onto a 6-well ultra-low attachment plate.
After 10–14 days of culture, the number of tumor
spheres formed (diameter > 100 μm) was counted under
microscope.

Cell proliferation assay
The EC cells and their resistant counterparts were
treated with 0.1% DMSO (as control), ABT-263 or 5-FU
or combination at different dosage for 6 days as indicated
and then the cell viability were detected using MTS assay as
following: cell proliferation assays were performed using the
CellTiter 96 aqueous nonradioactive cell proliferation assay
(MTS) according to the instructions of the manufacturer
(Promega Co., Madison, WI). Similarly, Sorted ALDH1
positive vs negative cells from JHESO cells and doxycycline
induced YAP1 high SKGT-4 (DOX+) vs YAP1 low cells
(SKGT-4 DOX-) [20] were treated with 0.1% DMSO (as
control), ABT-263 or 5-FU or combination at different
dosage for 6 days and then the cell viability were detected
using MTS assay as above described. All assays were
performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times.

Protein extraction and Western blot analysis
Protein isolation and Western blot analyses were
performed as previously described [20].

Indirect immunofluorescence
Indirect immunofluorescence staining was
performed as described (20). Expression and localization
of YAP1, b-catenin and CyclinD1 were observed under a
confocal microscope system (FluoView FV500; Olympus,
Melville, NY) and analyzed by CellQuest PRO software
(BD Biosciences).

Flow cytometric and apoptotic analysis

Reverse-phase protein arrays (RPPA)

Apoptotic analysis by flow cytometry was
performed as previously described [44]. In brief, SKGT4, KATO-TN and Yes-6 cells were seeded onto six-well
plates (1 × 105 per well) in DMEM and cultured for 24 h
to allow cell attachment. The cells were then treated with
0.1% DMSO (as control) or ABT-263 and/or 5-FU at
different dosage for 48 h. Then the cells were harvested,

RPPA analysis was performed in cell lysate from
JHESO cells control and treated with ABT-263 at 1 μM
for 48 h in RPPA core facility, the U.T. M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center. Samples were serially diluted 2-fold for
5 dilutions and probed with 175 antibodies and arrayed
on nitrocellulose-coated slides. Relative protein levels

were normalized for protein loading and determined by
interpolation of each dilution curve from the standard
curve as previously described [45].
