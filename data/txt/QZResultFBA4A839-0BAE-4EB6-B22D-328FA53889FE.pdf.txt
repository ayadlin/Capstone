BACKGROUND: Receptors in tumor blood vessels are attractive targets for ligand-directed drug discovery and development. The
authors have worked systematically to map human endothelial receptors (“vascular zip codes”) within tumors through direct peptide
library selection in cancer patients. Previously, they selected a ligand-binding motif to the interleukin-11 receptor alpha (IL-11Ra) in the
human vasculature. METHODS: The authors generated a ligand-directed, peptidomimetic drug (bone metastasis-targeting peptidomimetic-11 [BMTP-11]) for IL-11Ra–based human tumor vascular targeting. Preclinical studies (efficacy/toxicity) included evaluating
BMTP-11 in prostate cancer xenograft models, drug localization, targeted apoptotic effects, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses, and dose-range determination, including formal (good laboratory practice) toxicity across rodent and nonhuman primate species. The initial BMTP-11 clinical development also is reported based on a single-institution, open-label, first-in-class, first-in-man trial
(National Clinical Trials number NCT00872157) in patients with metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer. RESULTS: BMTP-11 was
preclinically promising and, thus, was chosen for clinical development in patients. Limited numbers of patients who had castrateresistant prostate cancer with osteoblastic bone metastases were enrolled into a phase 0 trial with biology-driven endpoints. The
authors demonstrated biopsy-verified localization of BMTP-11 to tumors in the bone marrow and drug-induced apoptosis in all
patients. Moreover, the maximum tolerated dose was identified on a weekly schedule (20-30 mg/m2). Finally, a renal dose-limiting
toxicity was determined, namely, dose-dependent, reversible nephrotoxicity with proteinuria and casts involving increased serum creatinine. CONCLUSIONS: These biologic endpoints establish BMTP-11 as a targeted drug candidate in metastatic, castrate-resistant
prostate cancer. Within a larger discovery context, the current findings indicate that functional tumor vascular ligand-receptor targeting systems may be identified through direct combinatorial selection of peptide libraries in cancer patients. Cancer 2015;121:2411-21.

INTRODUCTION
Several lines of evidence indicate that blood vessels from
tumors express unique receptors that act as vascular “zip
codes” and can be targeted with ligands.1-3 Although the
identification of functional ligand receptors within the tumor vasculature is challenging, we recently demonstrated
that screening peptide libraries directly in humans enables
unbiased target identification.4-7 Nevertheless, whether these
targets can be translated into therapies remains unclear.
Treatment options for metastatic castrate-resistant
prostate cancer are limited, and the development of new
therapeutic approaches is urgently needed. We identified
a peptide motif (CGRRAGGSC) that binds to
interleukin-11 receptor alpha (IL-11Ra) in the tumor vascular endothelium by administering a phage library to a
brain-dead cancer patient.4-6 Human IL-11Ra was overexpressed and had expression profiles similar to those of
IL-11Ra and cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31 [also
called platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule]), with
colocalization during tumor progression and metastases in
a large cohort of prostate cancer patients; specific drug
binding to IL-11Ra and dose-dependent apoptosis induction of prostate cancer cells8 is mediated through a
receptor-interacting site within IL-11.9 Independent
groups have confirmed this ligand-receptor system by
characterizing the binding of CGRRAGGSC.10,11
On the basis of these findings, we designed a liganddirected agent, bone metastasis-targeting peptidomimetic-11 (BMTP-11), which consists of the
CGRRAGGSC motif synthesized in tandem to D(KLAKLAK)2, an apoptosis-inducing motif that is active on cell
internalization and has been validated in preclinical models of cancer, obesity, and retinopathies.8,12-17
Here, we report preclinical studies of BMTP-11
across rodent and nonhuman primate species and a phase
0 BMTP-11 trial in patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer. To our knowledge, this is the first-in-class,
first-in-man clinical trial to emerge from our longstanding human mapping project.4-7 Our findings
include selective BMTP-11 localization to human bone
metastasis and targeted tumor apoptosis induction, providing evidence of drug activity and tumor toxicity in
humans. These biologic endpoints establish BMTP-11 as
a targeted drug candidate against human prostate cancer
and support its further development.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Detailed methods are described in the Supporting Experimental Procedures (see online supporting information). Preclinical efficacy studies in rodents, pharmacokinetic, safety/
2412

toxicology studies in nonhuman primates, and criteria for
patient entry followed the procedures described in the Supporting Methods (see online supporting information).
RESULTS
Preclinical Efficacy of BMTP-11 Against
Prostate Cancer Xenografts

To evaluate the efficacy of BMTP-11 in preclinical settings, 2 classic nude mouse models were chosen: a
prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-producing, androgendependent model (LNCaP-derived) and a non-PSAproducing, androgen-independent model (DU145derived).8 In a third experimental system, we selected the
bone-forming prostate cancer MDA-PCa-118b model,18
which forms osteoblastic lesions in severe combined
immunodeficient (SCID) mice and uniquely recapitulates human prostate cancer.
In pilot experiments, nude mice bearing DU145derived tumor xenografts received either BMTP-11 (515 mg/kg subcutaneously every other day; produced
under good manufacturing practice conditions) or saline
(controls) (Supporting Fig. 1; see online supporting information). The efficacy of BMTP-11 was assessed by measuring serial changes in tumor volume. Tumors were
reduced (P < .0001) relative to controls in nude mice that
received 10 to 15 mg/kg BMTP-11 (Supporting Fig. 1A;
see online supporting information), whereas lower
BMTP-11 doses were less effective (Supporting Fig.
1B,C; see online supporting information).
Next, we assessed the efficacy of BMTP-11 (10 mg/
kg once weekly) by either intravenous or subcutaneous
administration in DU145-derived (Fig. 1A-C) or
LNCaP-derived (Fig. 1D-F) tumor xenografts. Differences in either DU145-derived or LNCaP-derived tumor
volumes in treated nude mice (P < .0001) were observed
relative to controls and, the optimal dose of BMTP-11 in
tumor-bearing mice was determined at approximately
10 mg/kg per week.
Marked expression/localization of IL-11Ra was
observed in MDA-PCa-118b tumors18 but not in nonmalignant stroma (Fig. 1G). Heterogenous IL-11Ra expression was measured using quantitative x-rays to
substantiate the pretreatment cohort assignment of
tumor-bearing SCID mice using the bone-to-soft tissue
ratio within tumors (Fig. 1H,I). Intravenous BMTP-11
treatment (10 mg/kg weekly) had antitumor effects compared with controls (P < .0001) (Fig. 1J-L). The average
control-treated tumors increased by 235% (range, 62%520%); in contrast, the change in BMTP-11–treated, tumor-bearing SCID mice was only 10.6% (range, 240%

(H) Severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice bearing MDA-PCA-118b–implanted tumors were divided into equal pretreatment cohorts using x-ray imaging, and (I) the bone-to-tumor stroma ratio was quantified in each group using relative mean grayscale analysis before treatment was initiated. (J) MDA-PCA-118b tumor-bearing SCID mice were treated with either BMTP-11
(10 mg/kg; n 5 5) or saline (control; n 5 5) intravenously through the tail vein once weekly for 3 weeks. Tumor growth was serially
monitored, and volumes were measured over time. Data shown are the means 6 SEM. (K) In a mixed-effects model, there was a

To evaluate BMTP-11 tissue distribution, polyclonal
antibodies (immunoglobulin G [IgG] antibodies [IgGs])
against the BMTP-11 proapoptotic domain were produced in rabbits using a single D(KLAKLAK) peptide

manner (Supporting Fig. 2D; see online supporting information). BMTP-11 immunoreactivity was observed in
nontumor-bearing mice injected with BMTP-11
(25 mg/kg) into the kidneys 20 minutes postinjection
(Supporting Fig. 3A; see online supporting information)
and was restricted to the proximal tubules (Supporting
Fig. 3B; see online supporting information).
Next, BMTP-11 metabolism was analyzed in tissues
using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-offlight mass spectrometry19 (Supporting Fig. 4; see online
supporting information). Although the absolute concentration of each BMTP-11 metabolite could not be quantified unequivocally, the relative abundance of individually
identified metabolites was measured based on peak intensities relative to BMTP-11 and other internal standards.
Kidneys from mice injected with BMTP-11 revealed that
BMTP-11 disappearance correlated strongly with the
appearance of GG-D(KLAKLAK)2, G-D(KLAKLAK)2,
and D(KLAKLAK)2 metabolites (Supporting Fig. 4B; see
online supporting information). We observed that
D(KLAKLAK)2 was the predominant metabolite, and
there were no detectable levels of the parent compound or
metabolites containing any portion of CGRRAGGSC 4

hours postadministration (Supporting Fig. 4C; see online

immunoreactivity in the kidney sections may represent a
combination of the drug and its metabolic derivatives.
BMTP-11 Stability and Interaction

We established assays to evaluate BMTP-11 in vitro, in
vivo, and ex vivo. BMTP-11 stability in saline was determined by mass spectrometry. BMTP-11 was solubilized
and incubated either at room temperature or at 37 C, and
serial aliquots were analyzed. Spectra analyses revealed
only 2 major peaks, both corresponding to BMTP-11: the
first peak was the single-charged form, and the second
peak corresponded to the double-charged form (Supporting Fig. 5; see online supporting information). The latter
peak was not present in samples that were incubated for 8
to 24 hours, thus establishing that BMTP-11 is stable in
aqueous solutions (Supporting Fig. 5; see online supporting information). Finally, to evaluate the functional
attributes of BMTP-11 in a preclinical setting, bone marrow supernates from human prostate cancer specimens
were collected and incubated with the drug, and its activity against prostate cancer cells in vitro was unchanged

compared with BMTP-11 that was not pretreated (Supporting Fig. 6; see online supporting information).
BMTP-11 Pharmacokinetics in Rodents

To profile the biodistribution and pharmacokinetic properties of BMTP-11, first, we carried out pilot studies in
mice using 125I-BMTP-11 (Supporting Fig. 7; see online
supporting information). Mice received either 125IBMTP-11 (15 mg/kg intravenously) or phosphatebuffered saline, and blood samples were serially collected
postinjection. After 24 hours, the mice were killed, and
their organs were collected and analyzed using a cscintillation counter. This iodination strategy determined
a specific 125I-BMTP-11 activity of 0.27 millicuries per
gram. On the basis of a standard curve (Supporting Fig.
7A; see online supporting information), we estimated that
0.05% of the dose would constitute a good signal-to-noise
ratio (approximately 50-fold). Circulating 125I-labled
BMTP-11 levels dropped quickly, and, by 15 minutes
postinjection, only approximately 25% of the dose was
present in whole blood; radioactivity levels in whole blood
no longer decreased after 4 hours (Supporting Fig. 7B; see
online supporting information). After 24 hours, most of
the radioactivity was in the kidneys, liver, spleen, and
heart (Supporting Fig. 7C; see online supporting information). A pharmacokinetics profile was calculated using the
standard curve, and a noncompartmental analysis was performed (Supporting Table 1, Supporting Fig. 7D; see
online supporting information).
BMTP-11 Pharmacokinetics in Nonhuman
Primates

Next, we assessed the pharmacokinetics of BMTP-11 in
cynomolgus monkeys (Fig. 2, Supporting Fig. 8; see
Cancer

July 15, 2015

online supporting information). We detected BMTP-11
in plasma spiked with drug concentrations as low as 0.003
lg/mL (Supporting Fig. 8A,B; see online supporting information). Ratios between BMTP-11 and D(KLAKLAK)2, the internal standard (Supporting Fig. 8C; see
online supporting information), exhibited good linearity
(Fig. 2A), indicating that CGRRAGGSC did not alter the
stability of D(KLAKLAK)2. Cynomolgus monkeys
received intravenous infusions of BMTP-11 at doses of
1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, or 9 mg/kg over 2 hours to mimic the
intended clinical application. Plasma samples were collected over the course of 24 hours to generate plasma
concentration-time curves for each animal receiving each
dose (Fig. 2B). Our results indicated that BMTP-11 levels
increased during infusion and decreased exponentially to
background levels at 8 hours. The area under the curve
(AUC) from zero to infinity was calculated from each
plasma concentration-time curve. In the dose ranges evaluated, the AUC increased proportionally with increased
dose, indicating that BMTP-11 clearance mechanisms
were neither saturated (Fig. 2C) nor concentrationdependent. The data were best fitted to a 1-compartment
open-body model (Fig. 2D), and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated (Table 1). The elimination rate constant for BMTP-11 was calculated using the terminal
portion of the plasma concentration-time curves. The
curve corresponding to the lowest BMTP-11 dose tested
(1 mg/kg) was not used, because samples that were collected 2 hours after the start of infusion (before discontinuing infusion) and 5 minutes postinfusion at this dose
were undetectable. Preliminary assessment of BMTP-11
metabolites in plasma from monkeys was based on their
molecular mass (Fig. 2E).
Dose-Range Determination and Toxicity Studies
in Rodents and Nonhuman Primates

Good laboratory practice (GLP) studies on mice, rats, and
monkeys were conducted to identify the dose range and
administration route for a formal assessment of the safety
of BMTP-11 (Supporting Table 2; see online supporting
information). Within the nonacute group (defined as the
group of animals in which >50% survived to study termination), renal injury, such as hyperplastic and/or regenerative lesions (as determined by clinical pathology and/or
gross necropsy), was the predominant toxicity, with
concentration-dependent severity observed across rodents
and primates. Clinical chemistry parameters related to renal function, such as serum creatinine and blood urea
nitrogen, often were elevated but generally returned to
baseline at the end of the study, indicating renal adaptive/

regenerative response. To rule out a neutralizing effect
contributing to transient renal findings, we measured serum levels of anti-BMTP-11 (antidrug antibodies) from
single-dose and multiple-dose studies in rodents and nonhuman primates (Supporting Fig. 9; see online supporting
information). Our results indicated that none of the mice
that received a single dose (3-10 mg/kg) and none of the
monkeys that received multiple BMTP-11 doses (4
weekly doses at 30 mg/kg per dose) developed immunoglobulin M (IgM) or IgG anti-BMTP-11 antibodies; serum samples collected from animals in these studies did
not exhibit immunoreactivity against BMTP-11 (Supporting Fig. 9A,B; see online supporting information).
Because CGRRAGGSC mimics native IL-11 binding to
IL-11Ra, which activates signal transducer and activator
of transcription 3 (STAT3),9 we measured serum anti-IL11 levels to ascertain whether there was a humoral immunogenic response against BMTP-11. Neither IgM nor
IgG was detected above background (Supporting Fig. 9C;
see online supporting information), indicating that
BMTP-11 is unlikely to induce a humoral response. Tumor toxicity results and the lack of an immunogenic
response led to a formal, definitive GLP safety assessment
study of BMTP-11 at doses of 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 6, and
9 mg/kg in nonhuman primates to complete preclinical
requirements for clinical trials.
Preclinical Safety of BMTP-11 in Nonhuman
Primates

A GLP-compliant safety study was carried out using cynomolgus monkeys to mimic the clinical regimen expected
(intravenous weekly for 4 doses). The objectives of this
nonclinical safety evaluation in primates were: 1) to iden2416

tify target organs for toxicity and determine whether toxicity was reversible, 2) to determine the starting dose and
dose-escalation, and 3) to identify parameters for safety
monitoring in humans. A recovery group at the highest
dose (9 mg/kg) was included. Clinical signs attributed to
BMTP-11 included alopecia, vomiting, dehydration,
increased urine output, and erythema. These clinical signs
were dose-dependent and were observed at the highest
doses (6 mg/kg and 9 mg/kg).
Hematologic findings included mild leukocytosis,
anemia, and mild thrombocytopenia. Mild-to-marked
azotemia was noted 1 week after the initial BMTP-11
dose. Azotemia lessened with continued administration
and was completely resolved at the end of the recovery period, with the exception of 2 of 3 monkeys in the highest
dose group.
Alterations in urinary analytes included glucosuria,
proteinuria, leukocyturia, and increased transitional/renal
epithelial cells. The magnitude of proteinuria and cell
counts in the urine decreased with continued drug administration; most urinary abnormalities resolved by the end
of the recovery period.
Primate necropsies 24 hours after the final BMTP11 infusion revealed dose-dependent findings primarily in
the monkeys that had received 3 to 9 mg/kg. Pale discoloration of the kidneys was grossly consistent with nephrosis. Kidney weights increased at the highest BMTP-11
dose. Histologic lesions were identified in the kidneys,
stomach, and pancreas and at infusion sites. Similar
dose-dependent lesions were described as degenerative/
necrotic, regenerative/reparative, and fibrotic and
were reported for BMTP-78,14 adipotide,17 and other
D(KLAKLAK)2-containing peptidomimetics. Tubular

of an identified lethal dose, we proposed an allometrically
estimated dose of 18 mg/m2 in humans, corresponding to
a BMTP-11 dose equivalent to 1.5 mg/kg in cynomolgus
monkeys,20 as a conservative starting dose for a first-inman clinical trial among castrate-resistant prostate cancer

directed targeting of BMTP-11 and to evaluate a correlation
of dose to activity and toxicity that would support a larger
dose-selection trial. A patient cohort (n 5 10) was identified
and screened in the trial with “intent-to-treat.” During preenrollment screening, 4 patients were deemed noneligible
for trial entry because of a low hemoglobin level (n 5 1) or
an absence of tumor metastases upon bone marrow biopsy
(n 5 3). The remaining patients (n 5 6) were enrolled in a
dose-escalation cohort and received BMTP-11 starting at
18 mg/m2 intravenously weekly for 4 doses. All 6 enrolled
patients had high-volume, castrate-resistant bone metastases
for which no standard therapy options were available (Table
2). Patients had received a median of 2 previous chemotherapy regimens (range, 1-7 previous regimens), and 3 patients
(50%) had received systemic radionuclide-based therapy.
All patients had readily demonstrated biopsy-proven prostate cancer in bone before registration and underwent a
repeat biopsy within 2 to 4 hours after the first BMTP-11
dose. All patients entered in this study had baseline IL-11Ra
expression relative to a negative control IgG (Fig. 3).
Our trial required post-treatment bone metastasis
biopsies for BMTP-11 drug localization (Fig. 4A).
Patients 1 and 2 were treated at the lowest dose level
(18 mg/m2), and each received all 4 planned BMTP-11
doses with no clinically apparent toxicity despite mild
increases in serum creatinine, dipstick proteinuria, and
urinary casts. Patient 3 was treated at the highest dose level
(36 mg/m2) and had a grade 3 decrease in glomerular filtration: his serum creatinine level decreased from 0.7 mg/
2418

dL at baseline to 3.8 mg/dL on day 15. Consequently, he
received only 2 BMTP-11 doses. The protocol was then
modified to require more aggressive post-BMTP-11–
forced diuresis and was reopened afterward at an intermediate dose level (27 mg/m2). Three patients were subsequently treated at the 27 mg/m2 dose. Patient 4
completed the 4 planned doses with minimal renal toxicity. Patient 5 went off study after 2 doses because of disease progression: on day 15, his serum creatinine
increased from a baseline of 0.6 mg/dL to 1.3 mg/dL, and
his urine protein increased from 151 mg/24 hours to
1840 mg/24 hours. Patient 6 received 3 BMTP-11 doses
and came off study on day 22 because his urine protein
increased from 132 mg/24 hours to 2180 mg/24 hours.
A secondary objective was to define acute toxicity in
patients. There were no treatment-related deaths and no
grade 4 events. All grade 2 adverse events according to
National Cancer Institute criteria21 were included regardless of attribution (Table 3). Most of the events (anemia,
elevated alkaline phosphatase, and hypoalbuminemia)
reflected metastatic prostate cancer affecting bone. Two
patients (33%) came off study for dose-limiting renal toxicity. Consistently, proteinuria and increased serum creatinine levels were the most prominent toxicities identified
in the formal preclinical evaluation of BMTP-11 in
rodents and nonhuman primates.
BMTP-11 localization in treated patients was determined by mass spectrometry analyses (Fig. 4B) and/or
immunohistochemistry (Fig. 4C). It is noteworthy that,

in all 6 patient biopsies (100%; 95% confidence interval,
54%-100%), BMTP-11 accumulated at bone metastasis
sites, indicating binding to prostate cancer after intravenous infusion and consistent with the preclinical data. An
analysis of all tissue samples by terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase dUTP nick-end labeling revealed tumor apoptosis and BMTP-11 colocalization (Fig. 4D).
With respect to clinical activity, we observed no
responses defined according to Prostate Cancer Working
Group 2 criteria.22 Moreover, a heavily pretreated patient
(Patient 4) (Table 2) who received treatment at the
27 mg/m2 dose level had marked symptomatic improvement and experienced transient, simultaneous declines in
serum PSA, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase levels coincidentally during BMTP-11 treatment, but
his tumor progressed rapidly when the candidate drug was
discontinued (Fig. 5).
DISCUSSION
Although the biology of castrate-resistant prostate cancer
remains poorly understood, most patients have osteoblastic bone metastases. With the exception of bone-seeking
radiopharmaceuticals,23,24 the development of drugs targeting the bone metastasis tumor microenvironment has
lagged behind new hormonal agents,25-28 immunotherapy,29 and cytotoxics.30
The preclinical evaluation of BMTP-11 activity and
its translation into an early clinical application in patients
included targeted efficacy, the development of liganddirected drug-detection methodology, and safety/toxicology studies in rodents and primates. All of these data were
Cancer

used to design and conduct a first-in-man clinical trial.
The primary endpoints of the study in patients with prostate cancer were to document physical targeting of BMTP11 and to evaluate the relation of dose to toxicity and efficacy in humans that would support a full phase 1 trial.
The clinical dose-limiting toxicity was somewhat predictable from our preclinical tissue-distribution and GLP
safety/toxicology studies; weekly BMTP-11 administration
in the dose range studied was associated with renal toxicity.
Preclinical safety study alterations in serum biochemical
and urinary analytes were attributed primarily to nephrotoxicity and altered proximal tubular function, and minimal changes were identified in the animals that received
the lowest doses. Renal toxicity is attributable to the Denantiomer proapoptotic moiety. Our studies revealed that
the targeting moiety (composed of L amino acid residues
only) was no longer present in the plasma 4 hours postinjection. Thus, all targeted D(KLAKLAK)2 peptidomimetics
present a very similar toxicity profile regardless of the targeted receptor within selective tissues. Hypophosphatemia,
hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, and glucosuria were attributed to decreased reabsorption at the proximal tubule. Given the absence of glomerular lesions,
proteinuria also was considered a likely consequence of
decreased endocytic uptake in the proximal tubule.
In the first-in-man trial, all patients experienced
increased serum creatinine and proteinuria, usually with
casts, and these nephrotoxic changes precluded the delivery of a full cycle in 2 of 6 patients (33%). These changes
were largely reversible without intervention beyond drug
withdrawal, and no patient developed chronic renal dysfunction. No other clinical adverse events were observed.
It is noteworthy that we demonstrated selective
BMTP-11 localization in bone marrow involvement in 6
of 6 patients (100%) with prostate cancer. This observation leaves no doubt that BMTP-11 reliably binds to prostate cancer after infusion and is consistent with its original
identification in cancer patients.4-9 Furthermore, colocalization of tumor apoptosis and BMTP-11 in this setting
confirms the preclinical activity of this ligand-directed
drug candidate and other D(KLAKLAK)2-containing
agents reported in animal models.12-17 We hope that
future studies with lead-optimized linkers, specific blockers, new formulations, and dose or schedule changes may
mitigate the reversible kidney toxicity resulting from renal
proximal tubule uptake. Because no lesions were observed
in the glomeruli, we concluded that the toxicity was not
caused by renal clearance.
In summary, this limited phase 0 trial with biologydriven endpoints 1) demonstrates ligand-directed drug

upper limit on BMTP-11 dose has been established for
this initially used “weekly 3 4” schedule, and hints of
drug efficacy have been observed. The current results provide justification for consideration of BMTP-11 as a targeted prototype drug against human prostate cancer and
for the exploration of lower doses and/or alternative
schedules to evaluate whether there might be a threshold
below which the renal toxicity is minimized or abrogated.
