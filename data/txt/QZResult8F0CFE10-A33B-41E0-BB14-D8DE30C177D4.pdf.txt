Abstract
TRAF4 is an adapter protein overexpressed in certain cancers, but its contributions to tumorigenesis are
unclear. In lung cancer cells and primary lung tumors, we found that TRAF4 is overexpressed. RNA interferencemediated attenuation of TRAF4 expression blunted the malignant phenotype in this setting, exerting inhibitory
effects on cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and tumor development in a xenograft mouse model.
Unexpectedly, we discovered that TRAF4, but not Skp2, was required for activation of the pivotal cell survival
kinase Akt through ubiquitination. Furthermore, TRAF4 attenuation impaired glucose metabolism by inhibiting
expression of Glut1 and HK2 mediated by the Akt pathway. Overall, our work suggests that TRAF4 offers a
candidate molecular target for lung cancer prevention and therapy. Cancer Res; 73(23); 6938–50. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in
the world (1). Although advanced molecular biology techniques have greatly accelerated the understanding of the biologic
mechanisms that underlie lung cancer development, the 5-year
survival rate is 15%, which has hardly improved from the 13%
reported 35 years ago (2, 3). A major challenge in treating lung
cancer is to identify novel therapeutic targets that can complement current chemotherapy (4).
Akt signaling plays a major role in tumorigenesis by regulating cell proliferation, cell cycle, cell survival, and metabolism
(5–7). Akt is constitutively activated in lung cancer, in which it
can regulate cancer cell growth and survival and confer resistance to chemo- or radiotherapy (8, 9). It is activated by various
stimuli, including insulin and EGF, and Akt phosphorylation at
Thr308 by PDK1 and at Ser473 by mTORC2 is required for full
activation (10). Studies detailing Akt activation indicate that
Lys63-mediated ubiquitination is essential for Akt activity (11,
12). Notably, different stimuli use distinct E3 ligases for Akt
ubiquitination. For example, TRAF6 or Skp2 mediates Akt
activation through ubiquitination in insulin-like growth factor-I or ErbB receptor signaling, respectively (13, 14). In addition, Akt hyperactivation as a consequence of Skp2 overexpres-

sion drives abnormal glycolysis in breast cancer, and Skp2 is a
marker for poor prognosis in HER2-positive patients (14).
TRAF4 is an atypical TRAF family member. Unlike other
TRAFs, which are not relevant to the genetic phenotype, in vivo
evidence strongly suggests that TRAF4 is involved in embryogenesis (15) and central nervous system myelin homeostasis
(16). TRAF4 is widely and highly expressed during development
and TRAF4 deﬁciency is embryonic lethal in approximately
one-third of the homozygote mutants in pure 129/SvJ genetic
background mice (17). Furthermore, TRAF4 deﬁciency results
in severe developmental changes in the respiratory system,
axial skeleton, and nervous system (17, 18).
TRAF4 was ﬁrst identiﬁed by differential screening of
human metastatic lymph nodes from a breast cancer cDNA
library (19). The ampliﬁcation and overexpression of TRAF4
suggested that it was involved in the initiation and progression
of primary breast cancers and metastases (19–21). Although
TRAF4 is overexpressed in various human malignancies (22),
the mechanism about the role of TRAF4 in tumorigenesis
remains unclear.
In the present study, we found that TRAF4 plays an important
role in lung tumorigenesis. The knockdown of TRAF4 dramatically attenuated the malignant phenotype in lung cancer,
including proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and
tumor formation ability in nude mice. Furthermore, we demonstrated that TRAF4, but not Skp2, is required for EGF-induced
Akt activation through its ubiquitination in lung cancer. TRAF4
deﬁciency markedly impaired the activity of Akt signaling and
Akt-mediated lung cancer glycolysis.

cultured at 37 C in a humidiﬁed incubator with 5% CO2
according to the ATCC protocols. Cells were cytogenetically
tested and authenticated before being frozen. Each vial of
frozen cells was thawed and maintained for 2 months (10
passages). Of note, 293T and HaCaT cells were cultured with
Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 10%
FBS and 1% antibiotics. Human lung cancer cells, including

ﬁltered through a 0.45-mm ﬁlter followed by infection into
HaCaT cells together with 10 mg/mL polybrene. At 16 hours
after infection, the medium was replaced with medium containing 1 mg/mL puromycin and cells incubated for another
6 days.
Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation
Protein samples were extracted with Nonidet P-40 buffer (50
mmol/L Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40,
and protease inhibitor mixture). For immunoblotting, proteins
(30 mg) were detected with speciﬁc antibodies and an alkaline
phosphatase (ALP)–conjugated secondary antibody. Proteins
were visualized by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation, extracts were precleared
with 30 mL (50% slurry) agarose A/G beads by rocking for 2
hours at 4 C. Beads were removed and 30 mL (50% slurry) of
fresh agarose A/G beads and appropriate antibodies were
added to the precleared lysates overnight at 4 C. The beads
were washed, mixed with 6  SDS sample buffer, boiled, and
then resolved by 8% SDS–PAGE. Proteins were detected with
speciﬁc antibodies and an ALP–conjugated secondary antibody. For immunoprecipitation under denaturing conditions,
proteins were extracted using regular immunoprecipitation
buffer plus 1% SDS and heated at 95 C for 5 minutes. The
samples were diluted 1:10 in regular immunoprecipitation
buffer before immunoprecipitation. Beads were washed, mixed
with 6  SDS sample buffer, boiled, and then resolved by 8%
SDS–PAGE. Proteins were visualized by immunoblotting.
Membrane fractionation
A549-shMock and A549-shTRAF4 cells were starved 24
hours in 0.1% FBS/DMEM. After EGF (50 ng/mL) treatment,
membrane and cytosolic fractions were prepared (the ProteoExtract Kit; Calbiochem) according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
MTS assay
Stable HaCaT and lung cancer cells were seeded (1  103/
well/100 mL) into 96-well plates, and proliferation was assessed by MTS assay (Promega) according to the instructions
provided.
Immunoﬂuorescence staining
Cells were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized
in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 minutes. Fixed cells were incubated
with an Akt rabbit monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.) overnight at 4 C followed by incubation with green
ﬂuorescent Alexa Fluor 488 dye-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (40 ,6-diamidino-2phenylindole). Samples were viewed with a confocal ﬂuorescence microscope system (NIKON C1si; NIKON Instruments
Co.).
Anchorage-independent growth

(8  103/mL/well) were seeded into 6-well plates with 0.3%
Basal Medium Eagle agar containing 10% or 20% (H1975) FBS
and cultured. Colonies were scored using a microscope and
Image-Pro PLUS (v.6) software (Media Cybernetics).
Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue array
A human lung tissue array (LC1005) was purchased from
US Biomax, Inc., and included 15 cases of adenocarcinoma, 15
cases of squamous cell carcinoma, 8 cases of large-cell
carcinoma, 8 cases of lymph node metastasis carcinoma and
38 cases of matched or unmatched adjacent normal tissue,
and 8 cases of normal lung tissue from necroscopy. A Vectastain Elite ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories) was used for
immunohistochemical staining according to the recommended protocol. Brieﬂy, the slide was baked at 60 C for 2
hours, deparafﬁnized, and rehydrated. To expose antigens, the
slide was unmasked by submersion into boiling sodium
citrate buffer (10 mmol/L, pH 6.0) for 10 minutes, and then
treated with 3% H2O2 for 10 minutes. The slide was blocked
with 50% goat serum albumin in 1  PBS in a humidiﬁed
chamber for 1 hour at room temperature and then with a
TRAF4 antibody (1:100 dilution in 50% goat serum with PBS)
at 4 C in a humidiﬁed chamber overnight. The slide was
washed and hybridized with the secondary antibody from
Vector Laboratories (anti-rabbit 1:200) for 1 hour at room
temperature. Slides were stained using the Vectastain Elite
ABC Kit. The intensity was estimated by Image-Pro PLUS (v.6)
and ImageJ (NIH) software programs. Statistical analyses
were performed using Prism 5.0.
In vivo tumor growth
Athymic nude mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were divided
into two groups (n ¼ 15) and injected in the right ﬂank with
shMock or shTRAF4 A549 lung cancer cells (3  106). Tumors
were measured by caliper twice a week. All studies were
performed following guidelines approved by the University of
Minnesota Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(Austin, MI).
Glucose uptake and lactate production measurement
Cells (5  105) were seeded in 6-well plates and after
incubation for 4 hours, medium was discarded and cells were
incubated in fresh medium for 8 hours. Glucose and lactate
levels were measured (Automatic Biochemical Analyzer,
7170A; HITACHI) at the Clinical Biochemical Laboratory of
Xiangya Hospital (Changsha, China).
Ubiquitination assays
In vitro ubiquitination assays were performed as described
previously (14). Brieﬂy, Flag-TRAF4, Flag-TRAF4-DM-Ring,
Flag-TRAF4-DM-TRAF, and Flag-TRAF6 were expressed in
293T cells, immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag, and eluted
from protein A/G beads using Flag peptides according to the
manufacturers' standard procedures. Flag-TRAF4 or TRAF4
mutants, Flag-TRAF4-DM-Ring and Flag-TRAF4-DM-TRAF, or
Flag-TRAF6 protein along with Akt1 (1 mg) were incubated
for 3 hours at 37 C in reaction buffer (20 mmol/L HEPES;

ubiquitin, 50 nmol/L E1, 850 nmol/L of Ubc13 or UbcH5A, 1
mmol/L ATP, 30 mmol/L creatine phosphate, and 1 U of
creatine kinase). After incubation, protein mixtures were
diluted in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer and supernatant fractions were precleared with protein A/G beads for 2
hours, and immunoprecipitated overnight with anti-Flag or
anti-Akt, after which protein A/G beads were added for an
additional 2 hours. Beads were centrifuged and washed four
times with E1A buffer. Proteins were eluted in 6  SDS sample
buffer and subjected to immunoblotting.
Statistical analysis
All quantitative data are expressed as mean values  SD of at
least three independent experiments. Signiﬁcant differences
were determined by a Student t test or one-way ANOVA. A
probability value of less than 0.05 was used as the criterion for
statistical signiﬁcance.

Results
TRAF4 is overexpressed in human lung cancer
Clinical RNA database sequence analysis of 40 patients with
lung cancer revealed overexpression of TRAF4 (data not
shown). To verify the high expression of TRAF4 in lung cancer,
we determined the protein level of TRAF4 in different lung
cancer cell lines and in a human lung cancer tissue array.
Results showed that, compared with normal MRC5 lung cells
or normal tissue, TRAF4 is overexpressed in lung cancer cells
(Fig. 1A) and in lung cancer tissues (Fig. 1B). These results
indicated that TRAF4 might be a critical molecule in lung
cancer development.
TRAF4 has a critical role in cell transformation
To investigate TRAF4 function in lung cancer, we generated
TRAF4 knockdown stable HaCaT cells using two different
shTRAF4 sequences (Fig. 2A; left top). An anchorage-independent growth assay was performed to assess the effect of TRAF4
on cell transformation. The result indicated that EGF-induced
colony formation was attenuated in TRAF4 knockdown cells
(Fig. 2A, right, bottom). Furthermore, overexpression of TRAF4
promoted anchorage-dependent growth (Fig. 2B, bottom) and
increased anchorage-independent growth with EGF treatment
(Fig. 2C, top). Usually, without EGF, HaCaT cells cannot form
colonies but, unexpectedly, colony formation was observed in
HaCaT cells overexpressing TRAF4 even without EGF treatment (Fig. 2C, bottom). Furthermore, although TRAF4 alone
could not transform 3T3 cells, it dramatically promoted the
transformation ability of H-RasG12V (Fig. 2D). These results
suggested that TRAF4 is associated with cell transformation.
Knockdown TRAF4 in human lung cancer cells reduces
tumorigenic properties
On the basis of our observations, we hypothesized that
TRAF4 may affect the tumorigenic properties in lung cancer.
Thus, we generated stable knockdown TRAF4 A549 (Fig. 3A,
top) and H460 (Fig. 3B, left) cells and measured anchoragedependent growth. Results showed that knockdown TRAF4
inhibited proliferation of A549 (Fig. 3A, bottom) or H460 cells

TRAF4 Regulates Akt Activity

Figure 1. TRAF4 is overexpressed in lung cancer cells. A, TRAF4 is highly expressed in lung cancer cells. Western blot analysis was performed to examine
TRAF4 expression in several lung cancer cell lines and normal MRC5 lung cells. B, TRAF4 is highly expressed in lung cancer tissues. Immunohistochemical
staining was performed on a lung cancer tissue array using a TRAF4 antibody. The intensity was evaluated using Image-Pro PLUS (v.6) and Image

(Fig. 3B, right). Knocking down TRAF4 expression also suppressed anchorage-independent growth of A549 (Fig. 3C) and
H460 (Fig. 3D) lung cancer cells. We extended our study to
examine an additional ﬁve lung cancer cell lines, including
H520, HCC827, H1650, H1299, and H1975 cells. Results indicated that knockdown TRAF4 inhibited proliferation and
anchorage-independent growth of all lung cancer cell lines
examined (Supplementary Fig. S1). Furthermore, we found that
xenograft growth of A549 cells in athymic nude mice was also
attenuated after TRAF4 knockdown (Fig. 3E). These results
suggest that blocking TRAF4 expression signiﬁcantly reduces
the tumorigenic properties of lung cancer cells.
TRAF4 is required for Akt activation and recruitment to
the membrane
Unlike other TRAF family members, TRAF4 has not yet been
clearly associated with a speciﬁc receptor or signaling pathway. To examine the function of TRAF4 in EGF signaling, we
assessed the activation of the EGF pathway in knockdown
TRAF4 HaCaT cells treated with EGF. Results showed that
knocking down TRAF4 expression impaired Akt phosphorylation and its downstream kinase S6 (Fig. 4A, left) and overexpression of TRAF4 promoted phosphorylation of Akt and S6
(Fig. 4A, right) with EGF treatment. We also investigated the
effect of TRAF4 on EGF signaling in lung cancer cells. Indeed,
TRAF4 knockdown strikingly inhibited EGF-induced Akt signaling in A549 (Fig. 4B) and H460 (Fig. 4C) lung cancer cells.

Recruitment of Akt to the cell membrane is critical for Akt
activation. We next investigated whether knockdown of TRAF4
affected Akt membrane translocation. Results showed that
TRAF4 is not only found in the cytoplasm, but is also expressed
on the cell membrane. In shMock cells, EGF treatment induced
Akt membrane translocation and activation; and phosphorylation of Akt on both Thr308 and Ser473 was dramatically
upregulated after EGF stimulation. However, knockdown of
TRAF4 inhibited EGF-induced Akt membrane recruitment,
which corresponded with a decrease in phosphorylation of
Akt on both Thr308 and Ser473 (Fig. 4D). Immunoﬂuorescence
staining results showed that Akt membrane translocation
induced by EGF stimulation was inhibited in TRAF4 knockdown cells (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Because E3 ligase TRAF6 and Skp2 are important for growth
factors IGF-I and EGF-induced Akt ubiquitination and activation (13, 14), respectively, we further determined whether EGFinduced Akt activation and membrane recruitment depend on
TRAF6 in lung cancer. As was expected, EGF-induced Akt
activation in A549 (Supplementary Fig. S3A) and H460 (Supplementary Fig. S3B) lung cancer cells as well as membrane
recruitment (Supplementary Fig. S3C) were not signiﬁcantly
different between shMock and shTRAF6 cells, which is consistent with a previous study reporting that TRAF6 is unnecessary for EGF-induced Akt activation (14). Next, we wanted to
know whether Skp2 or TRAF4 is most important for EGFinduced Akt activation in lung cancer. Thus, we compared the

Akt activation in lung cancer.
TRAF4 interacts with Akt1
To investigate the mechanism explaining how TRAF4
regulates Akt activity, we ﬁrst studied the interaction
between TRAF4 and Akt1. Flag-TRAF4 and HA-Akt1 were
cotransfected into 293T cells and immunoprecipitated with
anti-Flag or anti-HA to detect HA-Akt1 or Flag-TRAF4 in the
immunoprecipitation complex (Fig. 5A). In addition, the
endogenous Akt1 and TRAF4 interaction was observed in
A549 (Fig. 5B) and HaCaT cells (Fig. 5C) and was at least
partially dependent on EGF treatment. These results demonstrated that TRAF4 is a novel protein-binding partner
with Akt1. To identify the domain responsible for mediating

the interaction between TRAF4 and Akt, we constructed
Flag-TRAF4-Ring domain deletion (Flag-TRAF4-DM-Ring)
and Flag-TRAF4-TRAFc domain deletion (Flag-TRAF4-DMTRAF) mutants (Supplementary Fig. S5A) and generated
HaCaT cells stably overexpressing TRAF4-WT or TRAF4
mutants (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Flag-TRAF4 was immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag and the endogenous level of
Akt was detected in the immunoprecipitation complex. The
result showed that the TRAFc domain mediated the interaction between TRAF4 and Akt1 (Fig. 5D). We also showed
that the TRAF4 Ring domain- or TRAFc domain–deletion
mutant lost the ability to promote cell transformation
(Supplementary Fig. S5C and S5D). Collectively, our data
demonstrated that TRAF4 binds with Akt1 through the
TRAFc domain and its physiologic function relies on the
Ring and TRAFc domains.

to capture polyubiquitinated Akt.

detected by Western blotting.

TRAF4 is required for Akt1 Ub-Lys63 ubiquitination
Previous results showed that TRAF4 is required for the
recruitment of Akt to the cell membrane for its activation.
Because TRAF4 interacts with Akt (Fig. 5), we hypothesized
that TRAF4 might function as an E3 ligase to mediate Akt
activation through ubiquitination. Indeed, TRAF4 overexpression induced Akt1 Ub-Lys63–mediated ubiquitination in
293T cells (Fig. 6A). Notably, we found that knockdown of
TRAF4 abrogated EGF-induced Akt ubiquitination in A549
cells (Fig. 6B). Ubc13 is a well-known E2 ubiquitin–conjugating enzyme and is required for E3 ligase activity, including TRAF2- and TRAF6-mediated Ub-Lys63 ubiquitination
(24, 25). To investigate whether TRAF4 has a potential E3
ligase activity, an in vitro ubiquitination assay was performed. The result showed that Ubc13, together with TRAF6,
induced Akt1 ubiquitination and TRAF6 autoubiquitination.
However, Ubc13 is not available for TRAF4-induced Akt1
ubiquitination (Fig. 6C). Instead, we observed that another
E2 ubiquitin–conjugating enzyme, UbcH5a (26, 27), is suit-

able for TRAF4-induced Akt1 ubiquitination in vitro (Fig.
6D). Importantly, we also noticed that the TRAF4-Ring
domain deletion and TRAF4-TRAFc domain deletion failed
to induce Akt1 unbiquitination. This is consistent with the
observation that the Ring domain in TRAF4 is a functional
domain for E3 ligase activity and the TRAFc domain mediates the interaction between TRAF4 and Akt1. We next
examined whether knockdown of the putative TRAF4 target
Akt1 affects HaCaT cell transformation and lung cancer cell
growth in soft agar. As expected, knockdown of Akt1 (Supplementary Fig. S6A) inhibited HaCaT cell proliferation
(Supplementary Fig. S6B) and EGF-induced neoplastic transformation (Supplementary Fig. S6C). We also observed a
similar impairment in cell proliferation and colony formation ability in various types of human lung cancer cells,
including H1650, H1299, A549, and H460 cells (Supplementary Fig. S7A–S7D). These results indicate that TRAF4 might
possess an E3 ligase activity and is required for Akt1
ubiquitination.

TRAF4 Regulates Akt Activity

TRAF4 regulates lung cancer cellular glycolysis that is
dependent on Akt activity
The Akt signaling pathway is a hub in the regulation of
cancer metabolism (28). We speculated that TRAF4 might be
involved in the regulation of lung cancer cellular glucose
metabolism. Indeed, we observed that knockdown of TRAF4
inhibited the expression of Glut1 and HK2 (Fig. 7A and B left),
and also attenuated glucose uptake (Fig. 7A and B, middle) and
lactate production (Fig. 7A and B, right) in both A549 and H460
lung cancer cells. The inhibitory effect on glucose metabolism
induced by knocking down TRAF4 expression was not a result
of differences in cell numbers (Supplementary Fig. S8A and
S8B). To further determine whether the regulation of glycolysis
by TRAF4 is dependent on Akt activity, we transfected constitutively activated Akt1 (CA-Akt1) into knockdown TRAF4
stable A549 and H460 cells. CA-Akt1 transfection upregulated
Glut1 and HK2 expression (Fig. 7C and D, left). Moreover, CAAkt1 rescued the deﬁcient glucose uptake (Fig. 7C and D,
middle) and lactate production (Fig. 7C and D, right) in TRAF4
knockdown lung cancer cells. These results suggest that TRAF4
regulates glycolysis in human lung cancer cells, and these
biochemical processes are partly mediated by TRAF4 modulation of Akt activation.

Discussion
TRAF4 was initially identiﬁed in human breast carcinoma
in 1995 (19). Previous studies revealed that TRAF4 is engaged
in several signaling pathways. For instance, TRAF4 binds
with MEKK4 to regulate c-jun-NH2-kinases activation (29)
and also interacts with nucleotide-binding oligomerization
domain 2 to inhibit innate immune responses (30, 31).
TRAF4 plays a role in restricting interleukin-17 signaling
and Th17-mediated disease (32). TRAF4 mediates glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-induced NF-kB activation (33) and
TRAF4 can localize on the membrane to regulate cellular
adherent junctions (34). Although TRAF4 is highly expressed
in human carcinomas (22), its biologic functions in tumorigenesis remain unclear.
Our results showed that TRAF4 is overexpressed in human
lung cancer cell lines and tissues. To study the function of
TRAF4, we generated a stable TRAF4 knockdown HaCaT cell
line and TRAF4 knockdown attenuated EGF-induced transformation (Fig. 2A). TRAF4 overexpression promoted EGFinduced cell transformation and even without EGF, TRAF4
overexpression induced anchorage-independent growth of
HaCaT cells (Fig. 2C). In addition, TRAF4 enhanced HRasG12V–induced 3T3 cell transformation (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, we demonstrated that TRAF4 is required for the malignant phenotype of human lung cancer cells, including proliferation, colony growth in soft agar, and the ability to form
tumors in athymic nude mice (Figs. 3 and Supplementary S1).
These results suggested that TRAF4 plays an important role in
human lung carcinogenesis. However, a prior study identiﬁed
TRAF4 as a p53-regulated proapoptotic gene in a p53 temperature-sensitive cell line VM10 (23). TRAF4 overexpression in
p53 wild-type tumor cells, U2OS and HCT116, induced apoptosis and inhibited colony formation (23). This apparent

www.aacrjournals.org

discrepancy suggests that the same gene can display various
biologic functions that are dependent upon the form of stimulation and cell type.
EGF receptor (EGFR)–mediated signaling transduction is
almost always deregulated in human lung cancer, especially
the hyperactivation of its downstream kinases, including the
Ras–Raf–MEK–ERKs and PI3K–Akt pathways, which notably
accelerate malignant progression and induce drug resistance
(35–37). We found that TRAF4 knockdown impaired EGFinduced Akt activation (Fig. 4A–C), but had no effect on EGFR
or ERK1/2 activity (data not shown). Our results revealed that
EGF-induced Akt membrane recruitment was decreased in
TRAF4 knockdown lung cancer cells (Fig. 4E and Supplementary Fig. S2). These results led us to conclude that TRAF4 is
involved in regulating the Akt signaling pathway.
Recent studies indicated that Lys63-linked ubiquitination of Akt is critical in the process of Akt membrane
recruitment and activation in response to growth factors
(11, 13, 14). In addition, TRAF2 reportedly regulates ribosomal S6 kinase 2 activation through Lys63-linked ubiquitin
in EGF signaling (38). Consistent with structural characteristics of other TRAF protein family members, TRAF4 has an
N-terminal Ring domain followed by a series of zinc ﬁngers.
The Ring domain of TRAF proteins confers E3 ubiquitin
ligase capability (39). However, only two TRAF family
members, TRAF6 (40) and TRAF2 (41), were demonstrated
to possess E3 ligase activity. We found that TRAF4 binds
with Akt1 through the C-terminal TRAFc domain, and
importantly, this binding was also enhanced by EGF treatment (Fig. 5). Moreover, this is the ﬁrst report that shows
that TRAF4 is required for Akt ubiquitination (Fig. 6). We
examined the role of Skp2 in EGF-triggered Akt ubiquitination and activation in human lung cancer. Unexpectedly,
Skp2 expression was not different in human lung cancer
cells compared with normal lung cells. Notably, knockdown
of Skp2 had no effect on EGF-induced Akt activation (Supplementary Fig. S4). Our results imply that TRAF4, and not
Skp2, is the major mediator for Akt ubiquitination and
activation in human lung cancer.
To sustain unlimited growth, most tumor cells consume
glucose through the glycolytic pathway as their major energy
source to rapidly generate ATP even in the presence of oxygen
(28). This phenomenon, called the Warburg effect, is an emerging hallmark of cancer (42). The underlying mechanisms
explaining the deregulation of glucose metabolism in cancer
cells have not yet been completely elucidated, but Akt is known
to regulate vital metabolic enzymes or transporters, such as
hexokinase 2 (HK2) and glucose transporter 1 (Glut1; refs. 43–
45). We ﬁrst demonstrated that TRAF4 mediates glycolysis in
human lung cancer by regulating the expression of Glut1 and
HK2 through Akt signaling (Fig. 7), conﬁrming the importance
of TRAF4-mediated Akt activation in lung tumorigenesis and
lung cancer metabolic reprogramming.
Overall, we demonstrated that TRAF4 regulates Akt ubiquitination and activation and plays a critical role in human lung
carcinogenesis. TRAF4 is overexpressed in human lung cancer
and is essential for lung cancer cells to sustain tumorigenic
properties, such as colony formation, glycolysis, and xenograft
