BACKGROUND: Several large, randomized trials established the benefits of adjuvant trastuzumab with chemotherapy.
However, the benefit for women with small, node-negative HER2-positive (HER2þ) disease is unknown, as these
patients were largely excluded from these trials. Therefore, a retrospective, single-institution, sequential cohort study
of women with small, node-negative, HER2þ breast cancer who did or did not receive adjuvant trastuzumab was conducted. METHODS: Women with 2 cm, node-negative, HER2þ (immunohistochemistry 3þ or fluorescence in situ
hybridization 2) breast cancer were identified through an institutional database. A ‘‘no-trastuzumab’’ cohort of 106
trastuzumab-untreated women diagnosed between January 1, 2002 and May 14, 2004 and a ‘‘trastuzumab’’ cohort of
155 trastuzumab-treated women diagnosed between May 16, 2005 and December 31, 2008 were described. Survival
and recurrence outcomes were estimated by Kaplan-Meier methods. RESULTS: The cohorts were similar in age, median tumor size, histology, hormone receptor status, hormone therapy, and locoregional therapy. Chemotherapy was
administered in 66% and 100% of the ‘‘no trastuzumab’’ and ‘‘trastuzumab’’ cohorts, respectively. The median recurrence-free and survival follow-up was: 6.5 years (0.7-8.5) and 6.8 years (0.7-8.5), respectively, for the ‘‘no trastuzumab’’ cohort and 3.0 years (0.5-5.2) and 3.0 years (0.6-5.2), respectively, for the ‘‘trastuzumab’’ cohort. The 3-year
locoregional invasive recurrence-free, distant recurrence-free, invasive disease-free, and overall survival were 92% versus 98% (P ¼ .0137), 95% versus 100% (P ¼ .0072), 82% versus 97% (P < .0001), and 97% versus 99% (P ¼ .18) for the
‘‘no trastuzumab’’ and ‘‘trastuzumab’’ cohorts, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Women with small, node-negative,
HER2þ primary breast cancers likely derive significant benefit from adjuvant trastuzumab with chemotherapy. Cancer

KEYWORDS: Trastuzumab, HER2, breast cancer, node-negative.

Amplification and/or overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) confers a poor prog-

nosis, even for women with small, node-negative early-stage breast cancer.1-5 However, the widespread administration of
adjuvant chemotherapy and HER2-targeted therapy with trastuzumab has largely ameliorated this adverse prognosis for
women with node-positive and ‘‘high-risk’’ node-negative, HER2-positive (HER2þ) breast cancer.6-10 Since the first trials were reported on May 15, 2005,7,8 several additional randomized studies have confirmed, with high reproducibility,
the recurrence and survival benefits with adjuvant chemotherapy-trastuzumab in selected populations.11,12 However,
because women with small, node-negative, HER2þ breast cancers were largely excluded from these studies, it is not definitively known whether adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy confers benefits in this lower-risk population. Furthermore,
because of the modest event rate in this lower-risk population, a prospective randomized study may not be feasible. Despite the absence of existing (and perhaps forthcoming) data, clinicians are routinely faced with the challenge of making
treatment recommendations for women who do not meet historical study criteria.
To address the potential role of trastuzumab in low-risk patients, who would largely have been excluded from the
key randomized adjuvant trials, we conducted a single-institution, retrospective study of women with 2 cm, node-negative, HER2þ breast cancer who did or did not receive adjuvant trastuzumab therapy. The decision to use trastuzumab was

time dependent (pre- vs post-reporting of the adjuvant trials), thereby possibly minimizing uncontrolled confounding factors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
All women with pathologically confirmed, 2 cm, nodenegative, HER2þ invasive breast cancer diagnosed
between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2008 and
evaluated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
(MSKCC) for early-stage breast cancer management and
completing definitive locoregional therapy were identified
through an institutional database. Patients with isolated
tumor cells 0.2 mm in lymph nodes [pN0(iþ)]13 were
included. HER2þ was defined as 3þ by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or 2 (HER2 to chromosome 17
centromere signals) by fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH). Women with bilateral invasive breast cancer; any
concurrent, invasive secondary cancer; inadequate locoregional and/or systemic therapy documentation; or treatment with other adjuvant HER2-targeted agents
including lapatinib were excluded. Women with a prior
history of invasive breast cancer, anthracycline and/or taxane therapy, any metastatic cancer, or mantle irradiation
were also excluded.
To eliminate confounding by variable clinical practice patterns around May 15, 2005 when the results from
the prospective randomized trials were reported, we
excluded women diagnosed between May 15, 2004 and
May 15, 2005, thereby eliminating patients diagnosed the
year before the announcement who might have been
offered delayed trastuzumab.
Two cohorts of eligible women were ultimately
identified: a ‘‘no trastuzumab’’ cohort of 106 trastuzumab-untreated women diagnosed between January 1,
2002 and May 14, 2004, and a ‘‘trastuzumab’’ cohort of
155 trastuzumab and chemotherapy–treated women diagnosed between May 16, 2005 and December 31, 2008
(with trastuzumab initiated concurrently or within 8
weeks of chemotherapy completion). Because evidence
from a prospectively conducted, randomized study indicates that a brief course12 may confer comparable benefits
to a 1-year course of trastuzumab,9-11 the duration of trastuzumab administration did not impact ‘‘trastuzumab’’
cohort eligibility.
Patient and tumor characteristics were recorded for
all eligible patients. Overall survival was defined as the
time from diagnosis to date of death or the last direct
patient communication of any kind. For the 3 breast can-

5462

cer–specific recurrence end points (locoregional, contralateral, and distant), the final follow-up date for each
patient was defined as the date of locoregional invasive recurrence, contralateral invasive recurrence, distant recurrence, or last breast cancer status evaluation by any
MSKCC physician, MSKCC survivorship nurse practitioner, non-MSKCC oncologist, and/or non-MSKCC
primary care physician.
Locoregional invasive recurrence-free, contralateral
new primary/invasive recurrence-free, distant recurrencefree, invasive disease-free, and overall survival at 1, 2, and
3 years were estimated with 95% confidence intervals for
each cohort by the Kaplan-Meier method. Outcome estimates were compared using the log-rank test. Invasive disease-free survival was defined by the occurrence of any of
the following events: ipsilateral invasive breast tumor recurrence, regional invasive breast cancer recurrence, distant recurrence, death attributable to any cause,
contralateral invasive breast cancer, or second primary
nonbreast invasive cancers.17
To account for the differences in follow-up for the 2
cohorts, 3 years (the median recurrence-free and overall
survival follow-up for women in the ‘‘trastuzumab’’
cohort) was identified as the optimal time point for cohort
comparison (a time point that is further supported by the
observation that HER2þ breast cancers tend to recur
early overall3,4). Consequently, the 3-year locoregional
invasive recurrence-free, contralateral invasive recurrencefree, distant recurrence-free, invasive disease-free, and
overall survival estimates are highlighted.

RESULTS
Overall
Baseline characteristics for the 106 women in the ‘‘no trastuzumab’’ and the 155 women in the ‘‘trastuzumab’’
cohorts are shown in Table 1. The median age was 51
years (range, 23-84) for the ‘‘no trastuzumab’’ cohort and
52 years (28-81) for the ‘‘trastuzumab’’ cohort. The median tumor size was similar for the 2 cohorts, although the
proportion of 1.6-2.0 cm tumors was higher in the ‘‘trastuzumab’’ cohort and the proportion of 0.5 cm tumors
was higher in the ‘‘no trastuzumab’’ cohort. More women
in the ‘‘trastuzumab’’ cohort had lymphovascular invasion
(21% vs 11%). All women in the ‘‘trastuzumab’’ cohort
received adjuvant chemotherapy versus 66% of the ‘‘no
trastuzumab’’ cohort. Otherwise, no meaningful differences were observed between the 2 cohorts. For the 155
women in the ‘‘trastuzumab’’ cohort, the mean adjuvant

trastuzumab delivery period was 52 weeks (range, 1-68).
Two patients tolerated chemotherapy without notable
toxicity but refused further therapy after only 1 week of
trastuzumab: 1 woman received 8 mg/kg with the first
planned cycle of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5fluorouracil (CMF) but then declined any further systemic therapy; and 1 woman received 4 mg/kg with paclitaxel at 80 mg/m2 after 1 cycle of doxorubicin and
cyclophosphamide (AC) but then declined any further
systemic therapy because of ‘‘stress.’’ After 10 weeks of
adjuvant trastuzumab, 1 patient was lost to follow-up
for 4 months but ultimately resumed treatment and
received the planned course of trastuzumab therapy over
68 weeks.
As of September 1, 2010, the median follow-up for
women without recurrence and for survivors was 6.5 years
(range, 0.7-8.5) and 6.8 years (range, 0.7-8.5), respectively, for the ‘‘no trastuzumab’’ cohort and 3.0 years
(range, 0.5-5.2) and 3.0 years (range, 0.6-5.2), respectively, for the ‘‘trastuzumab’’ cohort.
Breast cancer recurrence-free and overall survival
outcomes are shown in Table 2. At 3 years (the median
follow-up for the nonrecurred women and survivors in
the ‘‘trastuzumab’’ cohort), the locoregional invasive recurrence-free survival was 92% (95% CI, 86%-97%) versus 98% (95% CI, 95%-100%; P ¼ .0137); the
contralateral invasive recurrence-free survival was 98%
(95% CI, 95%-100%) versus 100% (P ¼ .0817); the distant recurrence-free survival was 95% (95% CI, 90%99%) versus 100% (P ¼ .0072); and the invasive diseasefree survival was 82% (95% CI, 74%-90%) versus 97%
(95% CI, 94%-100%; P < .0001) for the ‘‘no trastuzumab’’ and ‘‘trastuzumab’’ cohorts, respectively. Of the 8
locoregional recurrences in the ‘‘no trastuzumab’’ cohort,
5 were in-breast, 2 were nodal, and 1 occurred in the chest
wall. Of the 2 locoregional recurrences in the ‘‘trastuzumab’’ cohort, 1 was in-breast and 1 was nodal.
At 3 years, the overall survival was 97% (95% CI,
93%-100%) versus 99% (95% CI, 98%-100%; P ¼ .18)
for the ‘‘no trastuzumab’’ and ‘‘trastuzumab’’ cohorts,
respectively. One death occurred in the first year of follow-up in the ‘‘trastuzumab’’ cohort, but no deaths were
observed in the subsequent 2 years. Conversely, 3 deaths
were observed within the first 3 years of follow-up in the
‘‘no trastuzumab’’ cohort. Unfortunately, despite efforts
that included phone inquiries to the primary care physician, other involved physicians, and local hospitals, the
cause of the single death that occurred in the ‘‘trastuzumab’’ cohort could not be ascertained.

The Kaplan-Meier curves for locoregional invasive
recurrence-free, contralateral invasive recurrence-free, distant recurrence-free, invasive disease-free, and overall survival are illustrated in Figure 1.
Subset of Women With Tumors £1.0 cm
Baseline characteristics for the subset of 45 women in the
‘‘no trastuzumab’’ and 54 women in the ‘‘trastuzumab’’
cohorts with tumors 1.0 cm are also shown in Table 1.
The median age was 51 years (range, 34-73) for the ‘‘no
trastuzumab’’ subset and 54 years (range, 28-75) for the
‘‘trastuzumab’’ subset. The median tumor size was slightly
larger for women in the ‘‘trastuzumab’’ subset (0.5 cm vs
0.8 cm). More women in the ‘‘trastuzumab’’ subset underwent breast-conserving surgery (48% vs 38%) and
received adjuvant radiotherapy (46% vs 40%). All women
in the ‘‘trastuzumab’’ subset received adjuvant chemotherapy versus 42% of the ‘‘no trastuzumab’’ subset. Otherwise, no meaningful differences were observed between
the two subsets.
As of September 1, 2010, the median follow-up for
the subset of 45 women in the ‘‘no trastuzumab’’ cohort
with tumors 1.0 cm was 6.5 years (range, 0.7-8.5) for
women without a recurrence and 6.7 years (range, 0.78.5) for survivors. The median follow-up for the subset of
54 women in the ‘‘trastuzumab’’ cohort with tumors 1.0
cm was 3.0 years (range, 0.5-5.0) for women without a recurrence and 3.0 years (range, 0.6-5.1) for survivors.
Breast cancer recurrence-free and overall survival
outcomes for the subsets are shown in Table 2. At 3 years
(the median follow-up for the nonrecurred women and
survivors in the 1.0 cm subset of the ‘‘trastuzumab’’
cohort), the locoregional invasive recurrence-free survival
was 92% (95% CI, 84%-100%) versus 96% (95% CI,
90%-100%; P ¼ .303); the contralateral invasive recurrence-free survival was 97% (95% CI, 92%-100%) versus
100% (P ¼ .2575); the distant recurrence-free survival
was 97% (95% CI, 92%-100%) versus 100% (P ¼

Furthermore, a recent report from one of the prospectively conducted, randomized adjuvant trastuzumab studies indicated that the benefit of trastuzumab likely extends
to the subset of women with 1.1-2.0 cm, node-negative,

patient, treatment, and tumor characteristics and by
including lower-risk women with subcentimeter tumors),
we compared cohorts of women with small, node-negative, HER2þ breast cancers treated in the pre- and posttrastuzumab eras. Our findings were consistent with other
reports and indicated that despite the conventionally
favorable pathologic features, women with small, nodenegative, HER2þ breast cancer appear to derive a clinically significant benefit from adjuvant trastuzumab with
chemotherapy. Specifically, at 3 years, significant benefits
were observed in favor of the trastuzumab-treated cohort
for locoregional invasive recurrence-free survival (92% vs
98%, P ¼ .0137), invasive disease-free survival (82% vs
97%, P < .0001), and distant recurrence-free survival
(95% vs 100%, P ¼ .0072). Furthermore, although not
statistically significant, consistent benefits were observed
in favor of the trastuzumab-treated cohort for contralateral invasive recurrence-free survival (98% vs 100%, P ¼
.0817) and overall survival (97% vs 99%, P ¼ .18). Together, the consistency of these study results with those
reported in other studies support consideration of trastuzumab-chemotherapy in this population for whom, to the
best of our knowledge, no randomized control trials are
planned.
Because risk-benefit analyses are particularly challenging in women with subcentimeter, node-negative,
HER2þ tumors, we included outcomes analyses for this
subset in our study. Although underpowered to demonstrate any significant differences in individual end points,
a significant difference was observed in the evaluated composite end point, invasive disease-free survival, in favor of
the trastuzumab-treated subset. Specifically, at 3 years, the
invasive disease-free survival was 78% versus 95% (P ¼
.0198). Furthermore, the consistency of the other end
point results with the overall study results is notable, with
improved outcomes reported for the trastuzumab-treated
population for every breast cancer–specific outcome
including locoregional invasive recurrence-free survival,
contralateral invasive recurrence-free survival, and distant
recurrence-free survival. Although these results overall are
underpowered to support a definitive recommendation,

the consistency of the data indicates that the benefits of
chemotherapy with trastuzumab even in this lower-risk
subset cannot be ruled out. Unfortunately, randomized
trials in this low-risk subset are unlikely.
The strengths of our study include the sample size
and the balance of traditional prognostic characteristics
across the 2 cohorts. Furthermore, the finding that the
trastuzumab-treated cohort may have been at slightly
higher risk of recurrence overall (given the higher proportion of women with lymphovascular invasion and 1.6-2.0
cm tumors) combined with the observed reduction in the
event rate in this cohort strengthens our hypothesis that
such patients benefit from trastuzumab-chemotherapy. In
the absence of prospectively collected randomized data,
these observations support clinical consideration of trastuzumab-chemotherapy even in lower-risk HER2þ
populations.
The major limitation of our study is the inability to
discern how much of the observed benefit can be ascribed
specifically to trastuzumab versus chemotherapy administration. Unfortunately, this question can only be
adequately addressed by a prospective, randomized study
of, for example, trastuzumab with or without chemotherapy in this lower-risk population. Again, to the best of our
knowledge, such a study is not currently planned. Our
study is also retrospective, limited to a single institution,
contains modest event rates, and is unable to report all
details of potential interest (most notably the cause of the
1 death in the trastuzumab cohort). Although the proportion of hormone-sensitive tumors (60%) in this study was
larger than that reported in a population-based study
(39%),5 it was similar to the proportions reported in other
single-institution studies,3,4 suggesting either referral or
hormone receptor reporting biases.
Although we lack, and are unlikely to ever obtain,
randomized data addressing the role of trastuzumab in
women with small, node-negative, HER2þ primary invasive breast cancers, our study suggests that these women
have excellent outcomes after adjuvant chemotherapy
with trastuzumab compared with a similar population of
trastuzumab-untreated women. The critical issue is that
approximately 10% of the approximately 200,000 new
cases of invasive breast cancer anticipated in the United
States in 201116 will be otherwise low risk but HER2þ is
associated with an estimated 20% 5-year recurrence
risk.3-5 Therefore, if our results are correct, broad use
of trastuzumab with chemotherapy in this understudied population would have an important public
health impact. Our data support consideration of
