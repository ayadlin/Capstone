ABSTRACT
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a large family of small non-coding RNAs that negatively
regulate protein-coding gene expression post-transcriptionally via base pairing
between the 5′ seed region of a miRNA and the 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) of
a messenger RNA (mRNA). Recent evidence has supported the critical role that
miRNAs play in many diseases including cancer. The miR-200 family consisting
of 5 members (miR-200a, -200b, -200c, -141, -429) is an emerging miRNA family
that has been shown to play crucial roles in cancer initiation and metastasis, and
potentially be important for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. While miR-200s
were found to be critically involved in the metastatic colonization to the lungs in
mouse mammary xenograft tumor models, a large number of studies demonstrated
their strong suppressive effects on cell transformation, cancer cell proliferation,
migration, invasion, tumor growth and metastasis. This review aims to discuss
research findings about the role of the miR-200 family in cancer initiation, each
step of cancer metastatic cascade, cancer diagnosis and treatment. A comprehensive
summary of currently validated miR-200 targets is also presented. It is concluded that
miR-200 family may serve as novel targets for the therapy of multiple types of cancer.

post-transcriptionally. MiRNAs are initially transcribed
mono- or polycistronically in the nucleus by RNA
polymerase II into primary transcripts (termed primary
miRNA, pri-miRNA) ranging from hundreds to thousands
of nucleotides long, which are then polyadenylated and
capped [7, 8]. These pri-miRNA transcripts are subjected
to a microprocessing event carried out by a type III RNase
Drosha and its binding partner DiGeorge Syndrome Critical
Region 8 (DGCR8) to reduce the size of the transcript
to ~70 nucleotides termed precursor- or pre-miRNA
[9,  10]. The pre-miRNA is then exported to the cytosol
by exportin-5, where it undergoes another processing
event performed by another type III RNase Dicer resulting
in a ~21–22 nucleotide miRNA duplex [11,  12]. After
unwinding, one strand of the duplex is usually degraded,
while the other strand, the mature miRNA, is associated
with Argonaute and then incorporated into the RNA
induced silencing complex (RISC), where miRNAs are
then able to regulate the expression of their target genes.

INTRODUCTION
The miRNAs
The first microRNA (miRNA) (lin-4) was
discovered in 1993 [1, 2], however the term “microRNA”
wasn’t introduced until 2001 [3–5]. Within the next
year it was reported for the first time that miRNAs are
likely involved in cancer, by demonstrating that miR-15
and -16 were frequently deleted in chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL) [6]. Since this discovery a focus has been
put on identifying and determining the role of miRNAs
involved in cancer development, progression, diagnosis
and treatment. Through this effort, our understanding of
how microRNAs function and the role they play in cancer
has increased tremendously.
MiRNAs are a large family of small non-coding
RNA molecules (over 2500 in humans: miRBase.org)
that negatively regulate protein-coding gene expression

Although it has been shown that miRNAs can
interact with other parts of the messenger RNAs
(mRNAs) (for example see [13]), miRNAs typically
function by base pairing with the 3′ untranslated
regions (3′-UTRs) of their target mRNAs through the
seed sequences of the miRNAs. The seed sequence of
a miRNA is the second to the eighth nucleotide region
at the 5′ end of the mature miRNA that generates the
specificity of each miRNA to its target mRNAs. The
base pairing between a miRNA and its target mRNAs
can result in mRNA destabilization and degradation,
translational inhibition, or mRNA direct cleavage [14–
17]. Down-regulation of mRNAs through miRNA-caused
mRNA destabilization and degradation is common, which
is usually mediated by the same imperfect miRNA:mRNA
base pairing that leads to translational inhibition [18–20].
Conversely, mRNA down-regulation through miRNAcaused mRNA direct cleavage occurs in rare cases,
which usually requires more extensive base pairing [16,
17]. While a miRNA’s seed sequence is usually the most
prominent characteristic that determines the specificity
of the miRNA:mRNA interaction, there are examples of
miRNAs that have weak seed sequence binding but better
overall complementarity which can direct the inhibition
of gene expression [15, 21, 22].
MiRNAs are interesting because each can target
multiple genes and can also share seed sequences with
other miRNAs, therefore theoretically targeting the same
genes as other miRNAs. It is for this reason that miRNAs
have been thought to regulate upwards of two-thirds of
all protein coding genes in humans [23]. Furthermore,
miRNAs have been shown to be involved in almost all
aspects of cellular functions. Therefore it is probable that
miRNAs play critical roles in cancer development and
progression. Indeed there is a growing body of evidence
suggesting that miRNAs may act as either oncogenes or
tumor suppressors, and are involved in the development,
progression, and treatment of cancer (for reviews see
[24, 25]). These miRNAs that act as either oncogenes or
tumor suppressors in a cell are often called oncomirs [26].

Group II) both share the same seed sequence, with the two
functional groups only differing in the seed sequence by
one nucleotide (AAUACUG for miR-200b/200c/429 and
AACACUG for miR-200a/141). The miR-200 family is
highly conserved among vertebrate species and highly
expressed within epithelial cells.
The expression of the miR-200 family can be
regulated through interactions with, and modifications of
their promoters. Recent studies suggest that modifications
to the promoter regions of each of the miR-200 clusters
can cause the loss of the expression of the miR-200
family in cancer. The promoter region of the miR200c/-141 cluster has been shown to be hypermethylated
[29, 30], whereas the miR-200b/-200a/-429 cluster has
been shown to be silenced primarily through polycomb
group-mediated histone modifications [31] in cancer.
Alternatively, the promoter regions of the miR-200 family
can be bound by the transcription factors zinc finger
e-box bind homeobox 1 (ZEB1) and 2 (ZEB2 also known
as SIP1), specificity protein 1 (Sp1), and p53. When
bound, ZEB1 and ZEB2 can inhibit the transcription of
the entire miR-200 family, while Sp1 and p53 binding
has been shown to lead to activation of transcription of
the miR-200b/200a/429 [32, 33] and the miR-200c/141
[33, 34] clusters, respectively. However, Kolesnikoff and
colleagues also showed that Sp1-mediated activation of
miR-200b/200a/429 transcription can be disrupted by the
expression and interaction of ZEB1/2 with its binding sites
within the promoter.
The miR-200 family is among the most widely
studied miRNAs in cancer, this review will focus
specifically on the role of the miR-200 family in cancer
initiation, metastasis, diagnosis and treatment.

The miR-200 family in cell transformation
and tumorigenesis
Tumor initiation is a complex process by which
normal cells are transformed into malignant tumor cells,
which then produce a tumor. Throughout this process the
molecular profile of the cell is changed in such a way as
to allow these cells the ability to form a tumor. Recent
research has suggested that the miR-200 family plays an
important role in inhibiting cell malignant transformation
and preventing tumor initiation.
Recent research done in our laboratory has been the
first to show an important role of the miR-200 family in
inhibiting and preventing cell malignant transformation by
a carcinogen exposure [35]. Using immortalized human
bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) that either had normal p53
expression (HBECs) or p53 knocked down (p53lowHBECs),
we were able to show that chronic exposure to a low
concentration of arsenic caused epithelial to mesenchymal
transition (EMT) and malignant transformation in
p53lowHBECs, but not in p53 intact HBECs. Only the

The miRNA-200 family
The miRNA-200 (miR-200) family consists of five
members, which form two clusters located in two different
genomic regions. As shown in Figure 1, the Cluster I
miR-200s in humans contains miR-200b, -200a, and -429
(miR-200b/200a/429) located in an intergenic region of
chromosome 1, and cluster II miR-200s contains miR200c and -141 (miR-200c/141) located on chromosome
12 [27, 28]. Alternatively, the miR-200 family members
can also be divided into two functional groups based upon
the similarities of their seed sequences (Figure 2). MiR200b, -200c, and -429 (Functional Group I) all share the
same seed sequence and miR-200a and -141 (Functional

p53lowHBECs exposed to arsenic formed colonies in soft
agar and formed tumors in a subcuteaneous injection of
the cells into the nude mice. A miRNA microarray analysis
showed that the expression levels of miR-200 family were
drastically reduced in arsenic-transformed cells.
To determine whether down-regulation of the miR200 family plays a role in arsenic-induced cell malignant
transformation, we first transiently re-expressed miR200b or -200c in arsenic-transformed cells and found that
re-expression of miR-200b or -200c alone or together
restored E-cadherin expression and the epithelial-like
cellular morphology, and reduced the formation of
colonies in soft agar. Then we generated miR-200b stable
expression cells and found that stably re-expressing miR200b in arsenic-transformed cells abolished their ability
to form colonies in soft agar, and tumors in nude mice
when injected subcutaneously. Then we overexpressed
miR-200b in parental p53lowHBECs and found that forced
expression of miR-200b prevented cellular transformation
by chronic low dose arsenic exposure [35]. Together,
these findings suggest that loss of miR-200 expression
plays a causal role in arsenic-induced cell malignant
transformation and tumorigenesis.
A study investigating the mechanism of tobacco
carcinogen-induced cell transformation showed that a
4 week treatment of p53 intact HBECs with genotoxic, but
not cytotoxic, doses of N-Nitroso-N-methylurea (NMU)
or Benzo(a)pyrene diolepoxide (BPDE) caused EMT
and cell transformation as evidenced by occurrence of
mesenchymal-like cellular morphology and increased soft
agar colony formation [36]. Further experiments revealed
that expression of miR-200b and -200c were significantly
reduced after 4 week carcinogen treatment. Transient or
stable expression of these miRNAs in tobacco carcinogentransformed HBECs restored the epithelial-like cellular
morphology and reduced soft agar colony formation [36].
These two studies described above both looked
at epigenetic silencing as a possible mechanism for the
carcinogen-induced miR-200 expression loss seen in the
HBECs. It was determined that the promoter regions of
the miR-200 family were indeed highly methylated upon
treatment with the carcinogen, and demethylation induced
by DNA methyltransferase inhibitors or demethylation
chemicals increased the expression of the miR-200 family.
Therefore, arsenic or tobacco carcinogens may induce
cell transformation by increasing the methylation of the
promoter regions of, and subsequently leading to silencing
of, the miR-200 family. Together, these studies suggest
that loss of miR-200 expression may play an important
role in the early stage of carcinogenesis.

secondary (or metastatic) tumors [37]. Typically, cells that
accomplish metastasis have undergone widespread genetic
and epigenetic modifications that benefit the survival,
growth, invasion and movement of the cell. Metastasis
can be broken down into 6 steps [38]: 1) growth and
vascularization of the primary tumor, and nearby tissue
invasion, 2) detachment of the cancer cells and migration
away from the primary tumor, 3) intravasation into
the blood stream and lymph nodes, 4) survival and
circularization within the blood stream and lymph nodes,
5) attachment to the blood vessel wall and extravasation,
and finally 6) colonization of the distant organs and growth
of metastatic tumors. Each step symbolizes an important
obstacle that the tumor cell must overcome to result in
successful metastasis.
Current research on the miR-200 family has shown
that the family can affect each step of the metastatic
cascade. Therefore, this section will summarize these
works in respect to the order of each metastatic step as
described above.

Effect of the miR-200 family on tumor growth,
angiogenesis, and nearby tissue invasion
Once a cell undergoes transformation to a malignant
cell, the checkpoints that limit its growth are bypassed
resulting in uncontrolled growth. This uncontrolled growth
leads to the formation of a primary tumor. Not only has the
miR-200 family been shown to inhibit cellular malignant
transformation, but studies have also shown that they are
capable of suppressing tumor growth. For example, it was
found that forced expression of miR-200a in meningioma
cells [39], or expression of miR-429 in SW260 colorectal
carcinoma cells [40], reduced xenograft tumor growth
when injected into the flanks of SCID or nude mice,
respectively. However, the reported effects of miR-200b
on xenograft tumor growth are less consistent as some
studies including ours have shown that expression of
miR-200b decreased tumor growth [41, 42] while others
have shown that it has little or no effect on tumor growth
[43, 44]. Therefore more work is needed to determine the
role of the miR-200 family in this early step of metastasis.
Once a tumor reaches 1–2 mm3 the cells at the center
of the tumor are under hypoxic conditions and do not
receive enough nutrients to grow [45]. In order to combat
this environment a tumor must initiate angiogenesis,
which allows new blood vessels to form intricately within
the tumor. Recent studies have shown that the miR-200
family can inhibit angiogenesis because the family targets
multiple key players in this process.
In this regard, two separate studies have shown that
miR-200b directly targets vascular endothelial growth
factor A (VEGFA) [46, 47], a ligand that is considered the
master determinant for the activation of the angiogenic
program. Furthermore, the miR-200 family has also been
shown to target the VEGF receptors. For example, in

A549 lung cancer cells, Choi and colleagues demonstrated
that transient miR-200b expression reduced Flt1 (VEGF
receptor 1) and KDR (VEGF receptor 2) protein level, and
a luciferase reporter assay confirmed the direct interaction
between miR-200b and the 3′UTR of these proteins.
Similarly, miR-200c has also been shown to directly
target KDR [48]. These findings were further confirmed
by Roybal and colleagues showing that stable expression
of cluster I miR-200s reduced protein and mRNA levels
of the receptor tyrosine kinase Flt1 (VEGFR1) in lung
adenocarcinoma 344SQ cells [49]. Additionally, miR200a and miR-200b have also been shown to directly
target the pro-angiogenic ligands interleukin 8 (IL-8) and
chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1) to regulate
angiogenesis in ovarian cancer [50]. Taken together, these
data suggest that the miR-200 family plays crucial roles
in the metastatic cascade by down-regulating important
players involved in angiogenesis.
Research in our lab has also shown an important
role of miR-200b in inhibiting tumor angiogenesis. Ours
and other studies showed that inoculation of arsenictransformed cells produced invasive and metastatic
xenograft tumors in nude mice [51–53], however, the
underlying mechanism is not clear. To examine whether
arsenic-transformed cells have a pro-angiogenic activity,
we tested the effect of conditioned media from these
cells on the tube forming ability of human umbilical
vein epithelial cells (HUVECs). HUVECs cultured
in conditioned media from arsenic-transformed cells
formed extensive tubes compared to HUVECs cultured
in conditioned media from non-transformed control
cells, suggesting a pro-angiogenic capability of arsenictransformed cells [54]. To study the role of miR-200b in
this process, we used conditioned media from arsenictransformed cells that stably expressed miR-200b. It
was found that HUVECs cultured in conditioned media
from arsenic-transformed cells stably expressing miR200b formed significantly less tubes. Furthermore,
the immunofluorescence staining of CD31, a marker
of blood vessel endothelial cells, on xenograft tissues
resulting from the injection of arsenic-transformed cells
stably expressing miR-200b showed a drastic reduction
compared to CD31 staining on xenograft tumors resulting
from the injection of arsenic-transformed vector control
cells [54]. Our additional mechanistic studies suggested
that this reduction of angiogenesis by miR-200b is
likely due to down-regulation of VEGF levels resulting
from β-catenin sequestration at the plasma membrane
by increased expression of E-cadherin. Together, these
findings provide additional evidence supporting that miR200b is capable of inhibiting tumor angiogenesis.
Tumor nearby tissue invasion involves breakage of
the boundaries of tissues where tumors originate from and
the entry of cancer cells from the primary tumor into the
surrounding stroma. Sossey-Alaoui and colleagues found

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that WAS protein family member 3 (WAVE3) was critical
for the invasive properties of transformed cells [55].
Further analysis revealed that miR-200b directly targets
WAVE3 through interaction with its 3′UTR in MDAMB-231 breast, LNCaP prostate, and HT29 colorectal
cancer cells. To study the effects of WAVE3 on cell
invasion, a Matrigel-invasion assay showed that cells
treated with WAVE3 siRNA or that overexpression of
miR-200b reduced the invasive capability, while using
an anti-miR-200b oligonucleotide increased the number
of invading cells. Expressing a WAVE3 mRNA that is
resistant to miR-200b targeting also reversed the inhibitory
effects of miR-200b on cell invasion, further suggesting
a critical role for miR-200b in the inhibition of WAVE3dependent cellular invasion.
Another study looked at the effects of miR-200
on targets that regulate the reorganization of the actin
cytoskeleton to promote invasiveness [56]. Transient
transfection of a miR-200c mimic in MDA-MB-231
breast cancer cells showed a strong inhibitory effect on the
invasive capabilities of these cells in Matrigel and when
using a real-time cell analyzer. Furthermore, the increase
in the level of miR-200c was accompanied by a decrease
in stress fiber formation that was not accompanied by
a change in RhoA activity, suggesting that miR-200c
likely acted downstream of RhoA. Transient transfection
of miR-200c reduced both formin homology domaincontaining protein 1 (FHOD1) and Mg2+/Mn2+-dependent
protein phosphatase 1F (PPM1F) levels, and inhibition of
the miR-200b/c/429 cluster in MCF7 breast cancer cells
increased FHOD1 and PPM1F levels. A luciferase reporter
assay confirmed that miR-200c directly targets the 3′UTR
of these mRNAs in MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and HEK293FT cells. Silencing of FHOD1 or PPM1F resulted in
decreased invasion in MDA-MB-231 cells using the same
assays as before, showing the importance of these targets
in invasion.
Li and colleagues found that miR-200c expression
was significantly lower in A549, H1299, and SPC-A-1sci
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells among other
NSCLC cells [57]. Transwell invasion assays showed
that these cell lines that expressed lower levels of miR200c had a higher invasive capability than other NSCLC
cells. Furthermore when these highly invasive cells were
transiently transfected with miR-200c mimics, their invasive
abilities were significantly decreased compared to cells
transfected with control oligos, which suggests a suppressive
role for miR-200c on NSCLC cell invasion. Bioinformatic
analysis suggested ubiquitin specific peptidase 25 (USP25)
as a potential target for miR-200c and a luciferase reporter
assay confirmed the direct binding of miR-200c to its
3′UTR. To further show the importance of this protein
in cellular invasion, knockdown of USP25 significantly
reduced cell invasion and its overexpression increased cell
invasion as assayed by transwell invasion assays.

Effect of the miR-200 family on epithelialto-mesenchymal transition and tumor cell
migration

epithelial cells, suggesting that the miR-200 family
inhibits cell migration. Similarly, Park et al. found that
expressing miR-200a/c in the highly metastatic MDAMB-231 breast cancer cells significantly decreased their
motility in a transwell migration assay [62]. Both of these
studies also showed that cells that have undergone EMT
have an increased motility as well as an increase in the
expression of the mesenchymal markers ZEB1, ZEB2
and vimentin. Furthermore, these and others have shown
that the miR-200 family is a strong inhibitor of EMT, and
that EMT resulting from the loss of the miR-200 family
depends on ZEB1 and/or ZEB2 up-regulation. Therefore,
it was concluded that the miR-200 family elicits this
inhibitory effect on cell migration by targeting both
ZEB1/2.
However, ours and other recent studies also
suggest that the miR-200 family can inhibit cell
migration independent of its effect on ZEB1/ZEB2. Li
and colleagues found that mammary fat pad injection of
the metastatic MDA-MB-231 LM2 breast cancer cells
resulted in metastasis to the lung and bone, and this was
greatly reduced by the stable expression of miR-200b or
miR-200c [43]. This suppressive effect on metastasis was
not seen when miR-141 was stably expressed in these
cells suggesting that the functional group I miR-200s
(miR-200b/-200c/-429) is able to repress metastasis in
these cells. To determine whether miR-200 suppresses
metastasis by targeting ZEB1, the ZEB1 expressing
cDNA lacking the 3′UTR was engineered into the MDAMB-231 LM2 cells that stably expressed miR-200b. It was
found that miR-200b was still able to inhibit metastasis
when ZEB1 was forcibly expressed, which implies that
miR-200b can inhibit metastasis in a ZEB1-independent
manner. Through invasion assays and luciferase reporter
assays, it was determined that miR-200b regulates
cell migration and metastasis by targeting moesin, and
restoration of moesin prevents miR-200b from suppressing
cell migration and metastasis.
Our recent studies have also implicated the miR200 family in the ZEB1-independent regulation of
cell migration and metastasis. In the highly migratory
arsenic-transformed cells and basal mesenchymallike triple negative breast cancer cells, we found that
PKCα expression levels are significantly higher, and
re-expression of miR-200b reduced PKCα levels and
inhibited cell migration as well as mammary tumor
metastasis [42, 66]. Subsequent luciferase reporter
assays revealed that miR-200b directly targets the
3′UTR of PKCα. Moreover, siRNA knockdown of PKCα
significantly reduced cell migration. In contrast, enforced
expression of PKCα reversed the inhibitory effect of
miR-200b on cell migration and tumor metastasis with
no significant effect on ZEB1 expression. These findings
suggest that miR-200b suppresses cell migration and
metastasis by targeting PKCα, which is independent of its
effect on ZEB1.

One of the most critical properties that a tumor
cell must obtain in order to metastasize is the ability to
move away from the primary tumor. One of the most
widely studied cellular programs that tumors cells
activate to gain this motility is known as the epithelialto-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT is a process by
which a normally polar, epithelial cell undergoes a change
to a mesenchymal-like cell. By undergoing EMT, a cell is
able to take on the characteristics of a mesenchymal cell
and become more motile and invasive. Accompanying this
morphological change is a shift in expressed proteins, and
an increase in the production of transcription factors and
extracellular matrix degrading enzymes within the cell.
EMT occurs naturally during embryogenesis; however it
is now thought to be a major contributor to the metastasis
of epithelial-originated cancers.
Two of the major hallmarks of EMT include a
loss of the epithelial markers such as E-cadherin, a cellcell adhesion protein, and the increase in the expression
of mesenchymal markers such as ZEB1, ZEB2 and
other EMT-inducing transcription factors. These two
hallmarks are mutually exclusive from the other within
an epithelial cell. ZEB1 and ZEB2 act as E-cadherin
repressors by directly binding to the E-boxes within the
E-cadherin promoter [58–60], thus ZEB1 and ZEB2 are
directly involved in the control of EMT by suppressing the
expression of E-cadherin, and their expression promotes
cell migration and invasion. Recent studies suggest that
the miR-200 family is pivotal in regulating EMT by
targeting ZEB1 and ZEB2 via direct interactions with
their 3′UTRs [61–63]. Through down-regulating ZEB1
and ZEB2 expression, the miR-200 family can effectively
up-regulate cellular E-cadherin level and maintain a cell
in a more epithelial-like state. However, ZEB1 and ZEB2
can also bind to the E-box sites close to the transcription
start site of each of the miR-200 clusters inhibiting
their transcription, resulting in a negative feedback loop
[64, 65]. Thus, ZEB1 and ZEB2 can keep a cell in a
mesenchymal phenotype by repressing the transcription of
both E-cadherin and the miR-200 family. Therefore, the
interplay between the miR-200 family and ZEB1/ZEB2
plays an important role in driving the cell in to and out
of EMT.
Cell migration is a critical step in the metastatic
cascade where tumor cells move away from the primary
tumor to enter the blood stream. Early studies on the
miR-200 family have shown that the miR-200 family
can suppress cell migration. Gregory et al. first reported
the inhibitory effect of miR-200 on cell migration using
a transwell migration assay [61]. Using specific miR-200
inhibitors, this group found that the miR-200 inhibitors
increased cell migration of Madin-Darby canine kidney

By applying the Ago-HITS-CLIP technology for
transcriptome-wide identification of direct miRNA targets in
living cells, Bracken et al recently identified a good number
of miR-200a and miR-200b targets [67]. Further functional
validation of the identified miR-200 targets revealed that
they constitute subnetworks that play crucial roles in
enabling cancer cells to migrate and invade. The identified
miR-200 targets are critically involved in Rho-ROCK
signaling, invadopodia formation, matrix metalloproteinase
activity, and focal adhesions. This work showed for the first
time a global regulatory network directly regulated by miR200 family, which provided a novel mechanistic insight
for miR-200 family maintaining the key features of the
epithelial phenotype and preventing cell migration.

apoptosis and anoikis, and therefore may have an effect
on tumor cell survival in circulation.
In the case of apoptosis, Uhlmann et al. found that in
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, overexpression of the
miR-200b/c/429 cluster significantly reduced cell viability
and increased apoptosis [73]. It was further confirmed that
PLCγ1 was a direct target of the miR-200b/c/429 cluster,
and PLCγ1 knockdown resulted in reduced cell viability
and increased caspase activity.
Schickel et al. found that stably expressing miR200c in CAKI-1 kidney and HeyA8 ovarian or transiently
expressing it in ACHN kidney cancer cells, caused
these cells to be much more sensitive to CD95 (a death
receptor)-mediated apoptosis when treated with a CD95
agonist [74]. It was confirmed that miR-200c directly
targets FAP-1, a known inhibitor of CD95-mediated
apoptosis in these cells, and that the likely mechanism for
the sensitivity seen was due to an increase of CD95 surface
expression because of FAP-1 suppression. In another
study, miR-200c was shown to target Noxa, a member
of the Bcl-2 family, in MCF7 breast cancer cells [75].
Through functional studies in these cells it was determined
that miR-200c potentiates apoptosis to the clinically used
proteasome inhibitor bortezomib by reducing Noxa levels.
In addition, in meningiomas it was found that miR-200a
directly targeted β-catenin to increase apoptotic cell
death [76]. Therefore, downregulation of miR-200 family
levels in tumor cells can help the cell survive within the
bloodstream by reducing apoptosis.
Anoikis is a kind of apoptosis that is induced
by inappropriate or inadequate cell-ECM attachment.
Alteration of this complex signaling process can allow
tumor cells to survive in the circulatory system that is
normally unsuitable for these cells.
Howe et al. demonstrated that miR-200c levels
were significantly reduced in BT549 and MDA-MB-231
triple negative breast cancer cells [77]. Further work
showed that stably expressing miR-200c induces anoikis
in these cells by directly targeting TrkB, a neurotrophic
tyrosine receptor kinase. Zhang and colleagues also
studied the role of miR-200 in anoikis in breast cancer
[78]. Transfection of miR-200b in MDA-MB-231,
BT549, and Hs578T TNBC cells increased the number of
apoptotic cells in suspension-culture. Pin1, peptidylprolyl
cis/trans isomerase, NIMA-interacting 1, was confirmed
as a direct target of miR-200b, and simultaneously
expressing miR-200b and an untargetable Pin1 resulted in
a decreased number of cells undergoing anoikis in culture.
However, in contrast to these studies, Yu et al. found that
expression of miR-200a made breast cancer cells more
resistant to anoikis [79]. YAP1, yes-associated protein 1,
was confirmed to be a direct target of miR-200a and by
targeting this protein miR-200a allows cells to avoid
anoikis. Given the contradictory results observed, the role
of individual members of the miR-200 family in anoikis
still needs to be further studied.

Effect of the miR-200 family on tumor cell
intravasation
Intravasation is a complex step that involves cancer
cells entering the blood vessels or lymphatic system. It
can be aided by gene changes that promote the ability
of cancer cells to cross the basement and endothelial
membranes that form the walls of the vessels. Notch
signaling [68] and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)
[69] are two example mechanisms that have been shown
to positively modulate intravasation of cancer cells. In
addition to these mechanisms, new blood vessels that
have been formed by the primary tumor are leaky and
therefore can also facilitate intravasation [70, 71]. It has
been shown that stably expressing both miR-200 cluster
members reduced the ability of cancer cells to enter the
blood stream, and that E-cadherin overexpression can
also decrease the number of cells in the blood stream
[72]. However, there has been little research done with
respect to the mechanism by which miR-200 family
reduces cancer cell intravasation. This is probably partly
due to the difficulty in measuring intravasated cells in the
blood stream, and that the miR-200 family has a strong
suppressive effect on the earlier steps of the metastatic
cascade. More research is needed to fully understand the
intravasation process, and development of a system in
which we can directly observe and measure intravasation
is critical in doing that.

Effect of the miR-200 family on tumor cell
survival in circulation
After tumor cells have successfully intravasated into
the blood stream, they can circulate throughout the body.
These tumor cells that have entered the blood stream are
known as circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Since the blood
stream is such a harsh environment, these CTCs need to
adopt a molecular profile that promotes survival in the
blood stream. Therefore CTCs often reprogram certain
cellular programs such as apoptosis and anoikis to survive.
MiR-200 family members have been shown to regulate

By regulating above cellular processes, cancer
cells are able to survive in the harsh circulation system.
In addition, immune system differentiation, activation,
development, or response could also play critical roles
in the survival of intravasated tumor cells. However,
little research has been done specifically looking at the
effect of the miRNA-200s on immune system regulation.
Therefore, more research is needed in order to further
elucidate the role that these miRNAs play in this critical
step of metastasis.

expressed the other cluster (C1) also showed a significant
increase in expression levels; however, C1 overexpression
did not increase the expression levels of C2 miR-200
members. When 4T1 cells, the parental 4TO7 cells and
modified 4TO7 cells were injected into the mammary
fat pad of mice, it was found that all mice injected with
4T1 cells developed lung and liver metastases, while no
mice injected with parental 4TO7 cells had any detectable
metastases [81]. In contrast, injection of the modified C2
or C1+C2 4TO7 cells (cell lines that both express high
levels of all five miR-200 members) formed more lung
metastases than the parental or C1 alone overexpressing
4TO7 cells [72]. Furthermore, Dykxhoorn et al. also
found that about 80% of mice injected with C2 4TO7
cells developed lung metastases, indicating that the 4TO7
cells that stably express miR-141/200c act similarly to
the metastatic 4T1 cells [81]. In addition, Korpal and
colleagues also determined that this increase in metastasis
by the stable expression of the miR-200s was not due to
the increased E-cadherin expression because E-cadherin
overexpression alone in these cells caused no increase in
lung metastases that was seen in the C2 and C1+C2 cells
[72]. These data suggests that the miR-200 family targets
pathways involved in inhibiting metastatic colonization.
To further determine the underlying mechanism
behind miR-200 promotion of metastatic colonization,
Korpal and colleagues used a tail vein injection model
with the modified 4TO7 cells described above. Results
from this experiment showed more lung metastases for all
cell lines with C2 and C1+C2 cells having the greatest
effect. Knockdown of E-cadherin in C1+C2 cells did not
affect their metastatic efficiency significantly [72]. This
again suggested that other targets of the miR-200 family
are more important in colonization efficacy of a cancer
cell. Through microarray and mass spectrometry analysis
nine potential miR-200 targets were identified. Of these
nine targets, three were confirmed as direct targets of miR200: cofilin 2 (Cfl2), low-density lipoprotein receptorrelated protein 1 (Lrp1) and Sec23a, a key component of
COPII vesicles. Functional analysis in vitro and in vivo
revealed that miR-200 increased metastatic colonization
by targeting Sec23a. Further analysis also revealed that
Tinagl14 and Igfbp4, two secreted metastasis suppressors,
are directly regulated by Sec23a [72].
Interestingly, a recent study showed that the
metastatic 4T1 cells, but not the poorly metastatic 4TO7
cells, can secrete miR-200s into extracellular vesicles
(EVs) [82]. Moreover, it was also found that the poorly
metastatic 4TO7 cells can take up miR-200 from 4T1 EVs
and become metastatic in a miR-200–dependent manner
[82]. This study provided novel evidence showing that
metastatic capability can be transferred from metastatic to
non-metastatic cancer cells through extracellular vesicles.
In addition, this finding also suggests that circulating
miRNAs are not only just cancer biomarkers; they are also
functional being capable of promoting metastasis in vivo.

Effect of the miR-200 family on tumor cell
extravasation and metastatic colonization
The final steps of metastasis involve surviving
CTCs coming to arrest in the blood vessels, extravasating
from the blood vessels, and colonizing a distant organ. In
order for extravasation to occur, CTCs must first come
in contact the endothelium either by becoming lodged
in smaller vessels or by specifically adhering to the
endothelium. Once a circulating tumor cell extravasates
from the blood vessels (likely facilitated by ZEB1 and
N-cadherin expression [80]), these cells have a tendency
to undergo mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET)
which is most likely due to the absence of the signals they
received from the primary tumor to undergo EMT. MET
facilitates the settling of a cancer cell at a distant organ
by allowing these cancer cells to recover their epithelial
properties. Once a cell settles in the distant organ, it begins
to proliferate and colonize the organ. In striking contrast to
the strong inhibitory effect of miR-200 family has on the
early metastatic steps, studies have shown that miR-200
may promote metastatic colonization [72, 81].
To study the role of miR-200 in the last step of the
metastatic cascade, Korpal and colleagues profiled the
levels of the miR-200 family in primary and metastatic
samples and found that the miR-200 family was higher in
metastatic secondary tumors [72]. Moreover, profiling a
group of mouse breast cancer cell lines (67NR, 168FARN,
4TO7, and 4T1) with different metastatic capabilities
(67NR cells are unable to intravasate; 168FARN
cells cannot extravasate efficiently; 4TO7 cells do not
colonize distant organs well; and 4T1 cells are capable of
completing all steps of metastasis) revealed that the most
metastatic cells (4T1) had the highest level of miR-200
family expression. Similarly, Dykxhoorn et al. reported
that the 4TO7 cells, lacking the capability of colonizing
distant organs, had almost undetectable expression levels
of the miR-200b/c/429 cluster compared to the strongly
metastatic 4T1 cells [81], suggesting a potential role for
the miR-200b/c/429 cluster in colonization. To study the
role of the miR-200s in metastatic colonization, Korpal
et al. stably expressed cluster I (miR-200b/a/429: which
will be referred to as C1), cluster II (miR-200c/141: C2)
or clusters I and II (C1+C2) in the weakly metastatic
4TO7 cells. Importantly, it was found when C2 was stably

These studies suggest that even though the miR-200
reduces the number of cancer cells in the bloodstream,
probably by strongly inhibiting the early metastatic steps,
those cancer cells that have high expression levels of
miR-200s and do manage to get through the extravasation
step are more capable of colonizing a distant organ.
Additionally since these studies have shown that it is the
overexpression of the miR-200c/141 cluster that causes
the increase in metastatic colonization, it is possible that
the miR-200c/141 cluster may act as a suppressor for
early steps of metastasis, but facilitates post-extravasation
events while the miR-200b/a/429 cluster suppresses
metastasis at all steps. However, more research is needed
to discern the function of each cluster as a whole and to
elucidate the effect of each individual member of the miR200 family on the metastatic cascade.

carcinoma (OSCC) compared to 38 healthy controls [89].
These studies suggest that body fluid miR-200 family
levels may have different diagnostic values for different
types of cancers.
The use of the miR-200s as a prognostic marker
also looks promising. Comparing the expression levels
of the miR-200 family members in gastric cancer cell
lines, Valladares-Ayerbes and colleagues found that miR200c levels were much significantly higher in cancer cells
compared to normal cells [90]. Further analysis using
patient samples showed an inverse correlation between
miR-200c blood levels and prognosis, which suggests
miR-200c as a potential prognostic biomarker for gastric
cancer. Xu and colleagues were able to show that miR200 family expression was significantly correlated with
the status (benign, non-recurrent or recurrent primary, or
metastatic) of a melanoma tumor, therefore expanding
the potential role of the miR-200 family as a prognostic
marker in this disease [91]. In addition, Cheng et al.
reported that circulating miR-141 levels were negatively
associated with overall survival for the colon cancer
patients [88]. Furthermore, a high level of circulating miR141 was found to be associated with high-risk (Gleason
score ≥ 8) tumors [92], while a lower level of cluster I
of the miR-200 family was correlated with relapse [93]
in prostate cancer. High levels of miR-141 were also
correlated strongly with decreased overall survival in
the luminal subtypes of breast cancer [50]. In contrast,
it was found that low expression of cluster I miR-200s
(miR-200b, -200a and -429) correlated with poorer overall
survival in ovarian and endometrial cancer [94,  95].
Together, these findings suggest that miR-200 levels
may have the potential to serve as indicators of cancer
prognosis.
It is interesting to note that the majority of data
reviewed in previous sections from experimental
model systems showing that miR-200s suppress tumor
development and progression. However, the clinical
diagnostic and prognostic data summarized above are
much less consistent about the role of the miR-200s
as a suppressor of tumor growth and metastasis. This
inconsistence could be due to: (i) the levels of circulating
miR-200s, not the levels of miR-200s in cancer tissues in
most cases, were used for potential cancer diagnosis and
prognosis prediction. However, the origin of circulating
miRNA is currently unknown; (ii) it is likely that the
role of miR-200s in cancer development and progression
may be cancer type-dependent or even cancer subtypedependent. Indeed, Pecot et al. recently reported that
higher miR-200 levels in ovarian, lung, renal and basallike breast adenocarcinomas are associated with improved
clinical outcome. However, higher levels of miR-141 are
significantly associated with worse clinical outcome of
luminal subtypes breast cancer [50], suggesting that miR200 may exhibit differential functions among different
breast cancer subtypes.

The miR-200 family as potential diagnostic
and prognostic tools
The search for biomarkers that can serve as an early
detection method or as a predictive tool for prognosis is
needed to increase the earlier diagnosis and thus the long
term survival of cancer patients. The studies of miRNAs as
potential diagnostic and prognostic tools mainly stem from
reports showing that there are stable, cell-free miRNAs
in the blood (termed circulating miRNAs) [83–86], and
that circulating miRNAs have specific expression profiles
for different cancers, although their origins are currently
unclear. Further studies are needed to elucidate whether
they come from tumor cell death, are secreted from tumor
cells, or originate from blood cells associated with the
tumor as well as elucidate their expression patterns in
individual cancer types. It is because of this unknown that
most studies only show a correlation between a certain
cancer and miRNAs.
Studies showed potential in the use of members of
the miR-200 family for cancer diagnosis. A genome-wide
study by Madhavan et al. found that circulating miRNAs
can act as diagnostic markers for circulating tumor cells
(CTCs) in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) [87]. Their
analysis of CTC-positive versus CTC-negative MBC
patients revealed distinct miRNA signatures for each
group, and consequently 17 of these miRNAs were further
studied. Of these 17 miRNAs, four of them were from the
miR-200 family (miR-200b, -200a, -200c, and -141), and
this group concluded that miR-200b was the best miRNA
for determining CTC-positive MBC patients. Similarly, a
study by Cheng et al. found that plasma miR-141 levels
are increased in colorectal cancer, highly associated
with stage IV colorectal cancer, and able to increase the
detection of Stage IV colon cancer when combined with
the commonly used colorectal cancer detection marker
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) [88]. In contrast, Park
et al. reported that miR-200a was expressed at lower
levels in the saliva of 38 patients with oral squamous cell

chemotherapeutics paclitaxel, vincristine, and epothilone
B [103].
Using a miRNA microarray, Kovalchuk and
colleagues found that the levels of miR-200a and miR200c were significantly lower in MCF-7 breast cancer
cells that were resistant to doxorubicin compared to the
parental cells, suggesting that decreased expression of
these miRNAs may contribute to doxorubicin resistance
in breast cancer [104]. Using the same techniques as
Kovalchuk et al., Pogribny and colleagues found that
in MCF-7 cells miR-200b and -200c expression were
inversely correlated with resistance to cisplatin [105].
However, in contrast to the findings from above studies,
Hamano et al. found that miR-200c overexpression
induces cisplatin resistance in esophageal cancer cells
(TE8-R) [106], suggesting that the relationship between
the miR-200c expression levels and chemoresistance may
be cellular context and drug dependent.
A miRNA microarray done by Meng et al. in
cholangiocyte cell lines showed that miR-200b and -141
are dysregulated in malignant cholangiocytes [107]. By
culturing cholangiocarcinoma cells (Mz-ChA-1) with
gemcitabine in the presence or absence of miR-141 or
miR-200b inhibitors, they were able to determine that the
inhibition of miR-200b decreased gemcitabine-induced
apoptosis. Separately, Rui and colleagues also found that
decreased miR-200b levels are associated with resistance
to docetaxel in a lung adenocarcinoma cell line (SPC-A1
and SPC-A1/docetaxel) [108]. These findings suggest that
decreased expression of miR-200b may play a critical role
in chemoresistance.
A recent paper by Manavalan et al. has also shown
a link between the miR-200 family and targeted therapy
resistance in breast cancer cells [109]. The expression
levels of the miR-200 family members was determined
by qPCR in MCF-7 cells that were either sensitive or
resistant (LY2) to endocrine treatment, and showed
that the expression of miR-200b, -200a, and -200c
was significantly decreased in the endocrine-resistant
cell lines. To determine if these miRNAs affected
sensitivity to endocrine treatment, the LY2 cells were
transiently transfected with their precursor miRNA and cell
viability was determined in the presence and absence of the
antiestrogens 4-OHT (the active metabolite of tamoxifen)
or fulvestrant [109]. Results from this experiment showed
that expression of miR-200b and miR-200c enhance the
sensitivity of LY2 breast cancer cells to growth inhibition
by both 4-OHT and fulvestrant. Therefore, the miR200 family also plays a role in sensitivity to the specific
targeted therapies available for breast cancer.
Though much of the research on the miR-200 family
in cancer drug resistance has focused mostly on miR-200b
and -200c, it is possible that the other members of the
miR-200 family may also play similar roles in the process
due to their similar seed sequences.

The idea of miRNAs contributing to chemoresistance
has been widely studied [96, 97]. The ability of a cell to
avoid apoptosis [98] and to undergo EMT [99] have been
shown to contribute to the chemoresistance of tumor cells.
With the development of microarrays researchers have
been able to determine the expression levels and patterns
of miRNAs in chemoresistant cells, and this has allowed
researchers to determine potential miRNAs involved in the
process of apoptosis and chemoresistance. The role of the
miR-200 family in apoptosis has already been discussed
above in the survival in circulation section; therefore this
section will focus primarily on the effect of miR-200s on
chemoresistance.
Chemotherapeutic resistance of cancer cells is thought
to be one of the primary causes of recurrence in cancer.
Although inadequate delivery of the drug to the tumor can
contribute to chemoresistance, cellular reprogramming also
plays a major role in establishing this resistance. By turning
off genes involved in chemosensitivity and turning on genes
involved in chemoresistance, tumor cells can effectively
evade the drug. Studies have shown that the miR-200
family plays a role in reducing chemoresistance by targeting
these genes known to play a direct role in developing this
resistance. Liu et al. found that the expression of miR200c is decreased in melanoma tissues and cells, with a
further decrease in metastatic primary melanoma tumors
[100]. In depth analysis revealed that miR-200c reduces
the expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters
ABCG2, ABCG5 and MDR1 in WM115A melanoma cells.
This is important because of their known involvement in the
multidrug resistance seen in cancer [101]. These findings
suggest that downregulation of miR-200c may contribute to
the development of chemoresistance in melanoma.
By generating a doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer
cell line (BT474), Kopp et al. also showed that loss of
miR-200c is important in developing chemoresistance
[102]. It was found that miR-200c was significantly
downregulated in doxorubicin-resistant cells. When treated
with a miR-200c inhibitor, these doxorubicin-resistant
BT474 cells became even more resistant to doxorubicin
treatment compared to control cells. In contrast,
overexpressing miR-200c resensitized these doxorubicinresistant breast cancer cells to doxorubicin treatment.
Mechanistic studies from this group determined that
miR-200c reduces drug resistance in these cells through
targeting Neurotrophic Tyrosine Kinase, Receptor, Type
2 (TrkB) and BMI1 Polycomb Ring Finger Oncogene
(BMI1) [102]. In addition, another study revealed that
loss of miR-200c expression is associated with poorly
differentiated endometrial carcinoma; and restoration of
miR-200c in a papillary uterine cancer line significantly
increased its chemosensitivity to the microtubule-targeting

CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES

Although current studies on the miR-200 family
have shown promising results, more work is needed to
further understand the role this family plays in cancer.
Future work on the miR-200 family can help with better
understanding the mechanism by which miR-200s
affect cancer initiation, metastasis, and relapse. Since
much work has focused on the effect of whole clusters/
groups on metastasis, more work is also needed to be
done on individual members of the miR-200 family to
elucidate their role in each step of the metastatic cascade.
Developing new and robust models for the study of
intravasation and extravasation steps of metastasis are

Studies on the miR-200 family have enhanced our
knowledge of the crucial roles that they may play in cancer
development and progression through targeting a variety
of important proteins. A comprehensive list of currently
validated miR-200 family targets is presented in Table 1.
While miR-200s were found to be critically involved in
the metastatic colonization to the lungs, current findings
in general support the conclusion that the miR-200 family
may mainly function as tumor suppressors and metastatic
inhibitors as summarized in Figure 3.

also needed to advance our knowledge on the miR-200’s
role in these critical processes. Moreover, most of the
research done on individual miR-200 family members
focuses on miR-200b or -200c, therefore more work is
needed on miR-200a, -141 and -429 and their individual
role in cancer. Since some of the data on the role of miR200 family in cancer is controversial and cellular context
dependent, it is important for future studies to tease apart
which miR-200 family members act as a tumor suppressor
and which may promote cancer progression. Completing
these studies will lead to the discovery of more miR200 targets and ultimately the development of novel and
targeted therapeutic options for the treatment of cancer.
