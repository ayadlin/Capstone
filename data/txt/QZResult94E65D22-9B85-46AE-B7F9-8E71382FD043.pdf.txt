Abstract
The repair of melphalan-induced N-alkylpurine monoadducts
and interstrand cross-links was examined in different repair
backgrounds, focusing on four genes (b-actin, p53, N-ras, and
d-globin) with dissimilar transcription activities. Adducts were
found to be substrates for both global genome repair (GGR)
and transcription-coupled repair (TCR), with TCR being less
efficient than GGR. In nucleotide excision repair–deficient
cells, adducts accumulated to similar levels in all four genes.
The repair efficiency in different gene loci varied in a
qualitatively and quantitatively similar way in both GGRdeficient and TCR-deficient backgrounds and correlated with
transcriptional activity and local chromatin condensation. No
strand-specific repair was found in GGR+/TCR+ cells, implying
that GGR dominated. Adducts were lost over two sharply
demarcated phases: a rapid phase resulting in the removal
within 1 hour of up to f80% of the adducts, and a subsequent
phase with t 1/2 f36 to 48 hours. Following pretreatment of
cells with A-amanitin, the rate of transcription, the state of
chromatin condensation, and the repair efficiencies (both TCR
and GGR) of the transcribed b-actin, p53, and N-ras genes
became similar to those of the nontranscribed d-globin gene.
In conclusion, a continuous, parallel variation of the state of
transcription and local chromatin condensation, on one hand,
and the rates of both GGR and TCR, on the other hand, have
been shown. [Cancer Res 2009;69(10):4424–33]

Introduction
Melphalan {4-[bis(2-chloroethyl)amino]-L-phenylalanine} is a
nitrogen mustard used in the management of multiple myeloma
(1). It reacts with DNA, producing mostly N-alkylpurine monoadducts, a small proportion of which goes on to form interstrand
cross-links (ICL), which probably play a major role in cytotoxicity
(2–4). Melphalan monoadducts are repaired by nucleotide excision
repair (NER) with little, if any, contribution from base excision
repair, whereas NER and homologous recombination contribute to
ICL repair (5–7).
For a variety of DNA lesions, NER takes place more efficiently in
transcriptionally active DNA owing to the action of the transcription-coupled repair (TCR; refs. 8, 9). When both TCR and global

genome repair (GGR) are present, the overall efficiency of repair
of the transcribed strand is not necessarily additive. For example,
the N-(deoxyguanosine-8-yl) adducts induced by N-acetoxy-2acetylaminofluorene, known to be substrates for TCR and GGR,
are removed without strand specificity from the active adenosine
deaminase (ADA) gene of normal and TCR-deficient Cockayne’s
syndrome (CS) human fibroblasts (10), indicating that repair is
dominated by GGR.
There is evidence that other factors, in addition to the interplay
of GGR and TCR, contribute to the genomic heterogeneity of DNA
repair. For example, evidence of preferential repair of potentially
active genes, even in the absence of active transcription, was
obtained with a human cell line in which transcription of the ADA
gene was abolished by promoter deletion (9). Furthermore, in CS
cells, GGR of N-acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorene–induced adducts in
an inactive locus occurs much more slowly than in the active ADA
gene (10). These results are in line with other studies showing that
lesions known to undergo GGR are repaired considerably more
slowly in X-chromosome loci than in active genes, and that DNA
damage present in subnuclear compartments or chromatin
domains within which transcription occurs is preferentially
repaired by GGR (11–14).
Conflicting data have been reported about the mechanism of
repair of nitrogen mustard–induced N-alkylpurines. Thus, in
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, repair of such lesions occurred
faster and with a slight bias in favor of the transcribed strand in the
expressed dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene relative to a
noncoding 3¶-flanking region (15, 16). On the other hand, repair
was reported to occur at the same rate in the transcriptionally
repressed and the actively transcribed alleles of the c-myc gene in
Burkitt’s lymphoma cells (17). A similar independence of repair of
these adducts from transcriptional state was reported in the
metallothionein gene of CHO cells, with and without zinc-induced
transcription activation (18). Finally, Larminat and colleagues (19)
reported that, in CHO cells, at low adduct levels, preferential repair
occurred in the DHFR gene as compared with an inactive region,
whereas at higher adduct levels, there was no difference in repair
rates due to an increase in repair efficiency of the inactive DNA.
We have previously shown that, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of multiple myeloma patients treated with
melphalan, accumulation of N-alkylpurines in the p53 gene
correlates with better therapeutic response (20–22), and that
repair in different genes correlated with the gene transcriptional
activity and the degree of local chromatin condensation (23). To
further investigate the mechanistic basis of melphalan adduct
repair, we have now conducted studies in cells with varying
repair activity. For this purpose, we used four primary human

Gene-Specific Repair in TCR and GGR Repair Backgrounds

fibroblast cell lines derived from normal, CS complementation
group B, and xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) complementation
group C and group A subjects, whose DNA repair characteristics
have been previously characterized and shown to reflect specific
DNA repair genotypes.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture conditions. Primary fibroblasts from a normal
individual (VH25; GGR+/TCR+), CS complementation group B (CS1AN;
GGR+/TCR ), XP complementation group C (XP21RO; GGR /TCR+) and XP
complementation group A (XP25RO; GGR /TCR ) were cultured at 37jC,
in 5% CO2 atmosphere in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and
1% penicillin, streptomycin.
Cell survival studies. Cell survival was determined by measuring
colony-forming ability (15). A total of 500 cells were seeded in Petri dishes,
allowed to attach for 16 h, and incubated with melphalan for 1 h at 37jC in
complete medium. After incubation, fresh medium was added and, 10 to
14 d after plating, colonies were stained with methylene blue.

Cell treatment with melphalan in the absence or presence of
A-amanitin. To measure adduct frequencies in defined genomic
sequences, confluent cells were exposed to melphalan (10 Ag/mL for 1 h,
unless otherwise indicated) in complete medium (23). For time course
experiments, cells were subsequently incubated in drug-free medium for
various times, harvested, and stored at 70jC. In some experiments,
confluent cells were exposed to 10 Ag/mL a-amanitin for 6 h and
subsequently treated as above, except that a-amanitin was always present
in the culture medium.
Measurement of gene-specific damage and repair. For the measurement of total N-alkylpurines (monoadducts plus ICL), DNA was digested
with the appropriate restriction enzyme and N-alkylated purines were
converted to apurinic sites by heating and then to single-strand breaks with
NaOH. The DNA was finally size-fractionated by gel electrophoresis,
Southern blotted, and hybridized with appropriate probes (23). For the
measurement of ICL, following restriction enzyme digestion, DNA was
denatured and subjected to gel electrophoresis and Southern blotting. The
frequency of ICL was directly derived from the latter samples, whereas the
frequency of monoadducts was calculated by subtracting this value from
that of total N-alkylpurines.

For the analysis of strand-specific repair, riboprobes were used (16, 23).
Recombinant plasmids containing the appropriate DNA fragment were
digested with BamH1 (when using T7 RNA polymerase) or KpnI (when
using SP6 RNA polymerase) to generate templates for strand-specific
riboprobes. Reactions with T7 and SP6 RNA polymerases were carried out
with [32P]CTP using the Boehringer Mannheim SP6/T7 transcription kit,
and radiolabeled riboprobes were hybridized to DNA samples immobilized
on nitrocellulose.
Overall genome repair was determined by gel electrophoresis using
densitometer scanning of ethidium bromide–stained agarose gels (23, 24).
Measurement of RNA synthesis. For the analysis of total RNA synthesis,
cells were treated in triplicate with [5,6-3H]uridine during the last hour of
incubation (23, 25). Cells were subsequently suspended in ice-cold
trichloracetic acid; the resulting acid-insoluble material was collected onto
Millipore GS/0.22-Am filter discs and radioactivity was counted.
For slot-blot analysis, total cellular RNA was slot-blotted on nitrocellulose and hybridized to 32P-labeled probes; the expression of cellular genes
was evaluated by densitometric comparison (23, 26).
For nuclear run-off transcription, nuclei were incubated in the presence
of [a-32P]UTP, and the labeled transcripts were isolated and hybridized to
linearized, double-stranded, denatured, recombinant plasmids (5 Ag/dot)
immobilized on nitrocellulose (23).
Micrococcal nuclease digestion–based analysis of chromatin
condensation. Nuclei were isolated from 5  106 fibroblasts and digested
with 1 unit of micrococcal nuclease for 2 min at 37jC. DNA was purified,
separated in 1.5% agarose gels, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and
hybridized with the appropriate 32P-labeled probe (23, 27).

Results
Cytotoxicity. Following a 1-hour melphalan treatment, normal
cells showed the highest resistance and XP-A the highest sensitivity
(Fig. 1A). Loss of TCR (CS-B) had a greater effect on resistance than
did loss of GGR (XP-C) regardless of the remaining repair
background, whereas loss of both subpathways resulted in
additional sensitization (i.e., the effects of the two subpathways
were complementary).
Effects on total RNA synthesis. Figure 1B shows that total RNA
synthesis was inhibited by melphalan treatment in all four cell lines
and that cells with at least one NER subpathway active were
capable of recovering RNA synthesis after 24 hours. In contrast,
in NER-deficient cells no recovery occurred. Interestingly, the
sensitivity of the different cell lines to inhibition of RNA synthesis
parallels their sensitivity to melphalan cytotoxicity (Fig. 1A).
Transcriptional activity and chromatin condensation at
different gene loci. We focused our studies of repair on different
genomic loci corresponding to the b-actin, p53, N-ras, and d-globin
genes. The steady-state RNA levels of these genes were measured
by RNA slot-blot analysis (Fig. 1C, lane 1), whereas transcription
rates were measured using a run-off transcription assay (Fig. 1C,

lane 2). The results of both assays (Table 1) consistently showed
that transcription varies in the order b-actin > p53 > N-ras in all
cell lines, whereas no d-globin gene transcripts were detected. This
order of variation is in agreement with our previous findings in
human PBMC (23).5
To analyze chromatin condensation, nuclei from untreated cells
were subjected to micrococcal nuclease digestion. Figure 1D (lanes
1–4) shows that, in CS-B cells, b-actin gave rise mostly to
mononucleosomes; p53 to dinucleosomes and trinucleosomes with
a significant proportion of mononucleosomes; N-ras to tetranucleosomes, trinucleosomes, dinucleosomes, and mononucleosomes; and d-globin to higher structures. Similar results were
obtained with all cell lines (data not shown). Thus, as also reported
for PBMC (23), the local chromatin condensation varied in the
order b-actin < p53 < N-ras < d-globin, which inversely parallels the
transcriptional activity.
Adduct kinetics in different repair backgrounds. Monoadducts and ICL were measured following cell treatment with
10 Ag/mL melphalan for 1 hour. This concentration is of
biological relevance because it gives rise to adduct levels similar
to those detected in multiple myeloma patients following
therapeutic treatment (23, 28). In all cases, peak monoadduct
levels were observed 2 hours following the end of treatment, and
in XP-A cells, they reached very similar levels in all genes
examined (Fig. 2). On the other hand, substantial differences
among the different genes were observed in the remaining cell
lines, even when examined immediately after the end of
treatment (t = 0 in Fig. 2), indicating that substantial repair
occurred during the 1-hour treatment period. The differences in
the rates of subsequent adduct loss in the different cell types
and gene loci were, by comparison, minor. ICL levels reached
maximal levels within 8 hours after the end of treatment,
showed no evidence of repair in XP-A cells, and were
approximately 10% to 30% reduced by 24 hours posttreatment
in the remaining cell lines (results not shown).
Focusing on strand-specific repair, for all active genes
monoadduct kinetics in the transcribed strand (TS) and
nontranscribed strand (NTS) of GGR-proficient normal and CSB cells were very similar (Fig. 2A–C), showing maximal levels
2 hours posttreatment followed by slow loss with t 1/2 f36 to
48 hours. In these cells, monoadduct levels, immediately after
the end of melphalan treatment, were lowest (i.e., early repair

than those seen in the corresponding genes in GGR-proficient
cells, indicating that GGR is more efficient than TCR at repairing
the TS. The variation of the efficiency of early TCR between the
different genes paralleled that described above for GGR.

Little if any repair was observed in both strands of all genes in
XP-A cells and in the NTS in XP-C cells (Fig. 2). In all transcribed
genes, the presence of TCR only (i.e., in XP-C) was associated with
slightly higher monoadduct levels. As for the nontranscribed
d-globin gene, as expected, similar monoadduct kinetics were
observed for both strands in normal and CS-B cells, whereas little,
if any, adduct loss from either strand was seen in XP-C and XP-A
cells (Fig. 2D).
Substantial differences were observed between the levels of ICL
in different genes and cell lines (data not shown), which paralleled
closely those seen for monoadducts. Because the latter are the
precursors of ICL, no conclusions about ICL repair can be drawn
from this variation. Beyond the 8-hour peak, limited loss of ICL
(probably reflecting unhooking) was observed, which tended to
vary in the order normal cells > CS-B > XP-C > XP-A and b-actin >
p53 > N-ras > d-globin.
To further investigate the extensive repair occurring during the 1hour melphalan treatment, cells were treated with a higher
concentration of melphalan (100 Ag/mL) for only 5 minutes and,
subsequently, repair was followed for up to 2 hours (Fig. 3). The

results confirmed that, in the absence of NER, similar adduct levels
accumulated in all four genes (Fig. 3D), whereas in all repairproficient backgrounds, a substantial fraction (f60–75%) of the
adducts formed underwent rapid repair. Repair kinetics in normal
and CS-B cells were very similar (Fig. 3A and B), with adducts being
lost with t 1/2 ranging from <15 minutes to f2 hours for different
genes (Fig. 3B). Rapid initial repair was also observed in XP-C cells
with t 1/2 ranging f30 minutes to f2 hours and with a similar
variation as seen for GGR. As expected, no repair was observed in
the d-globin gene (Fig. 3C). Early repair was slower in XP-C cells
than in CS-B, confirming that TCR is less effective than GGR.
Effect of dose on repair efficiency. To explore whether the
lower efficiency of TCR might result from inhibition of initiation of
RNA synthesis, CS-B and XP-C cells were treated with various
melphalan doses (2–100 Ag/mL) for 1 hour, and monoadducts
measured in p53 (taken as representative of the transcribed genes).
In CS-B cells, a linearly dose-dependent increase in adduct levels,
reflecting constant repair efficiency, was observed throughout the
dose range used (Fig. 4A). In XP-C cells, a parallel dose-response
curve was observed, with higher adduct levels (i.e., lower repair

efficiency) up to a dose of 20 Ag/mL, beyond which an abrupt
increase in the slope occurred, reflecting reduced TCR (Fig. 4A). To
understand the molecular basis of this effect, total as well as p53specific RNA synthesis was measured under the same conditions.
Dose-dependent inhibition of total RNA synthesis until 8 hours
posttreatment, followed by slow recovery at 24 hours, was observed
at all doses (data not shown). On the other hand, in both cell lines,
with up to 20 Ag/mL melphalan, a dose-dependent, partial
inhibition of p53-specific RNA synthesis was observed, whereas
at higher doses (at which decreased TCR occurred) complete
inhibition and no recovery up to 24 hours were seen (Fig. 4B and
C). We conclude that any effect on transcription of melphalan at
low doses does not modify the relative efficiencies of TCR and
GGR. Strikingly, under these conditions, the gene-to-gene variations of the efficiencies of GGR and TCR were similar not only
qualitatively but also quantitatively (Fig. 4D).
Effect of A-amanitin on gene-specific repair. a-Amanitin is
an inhibitor of RNA polymerase II that can also induce
condensation of chromatin (29, 30). To examine the dependence

www.aacrjournals.org

of repair on transcription and chromatin structure, we compared
the rates of adduct repair in CS-B and XP-C cells without or
with prior treatment with a-amanitin. With the use of slot-blot
and run-off transcription assays, we confirmed that treatment with
10 Ag/mL a-amanitin for 6 hours completely blocked transcription
(data not shown). Using micrococcal nuclease digestion (Fig. 1D,
lanes 9 and 10), we found that a-amanitin induced some
chromatin condensation at the total DNA level, whereas, at the
level of specific genes, chromatin condensation of the active genes
in CS-B cells occurred, leading to a picture very similar to that
observed for the nonexpressed d-globin, for which no change was
observed (Fig. 1D, lanes 5–8).
Following a-amanitin treatment, the efficiency of both repair
subpathways in the active genes was significantly reduced and
became similar to that observed for d-globin, which was not affected
by a-amanitin (Fig. 5). In accordance with the increased condensation of total chromatin (Fig. 1D, lanes 9 and 10), a-amanitin also
led to marginally higher overall genome N-alkylpurine accumulation
(i.e., lower repair efficiency). Furthermore, in agreement with the

results of the gene-specific repair experiments, in the absence of
a-amanitin, the efficiency of the overall genome N-alkylpurine repair
was lower in XP-C than in CS-B cells (Fig. 5A and C).

Discussion
To further investigate the mechanism of repair of melphalaninduced N-alkylpurines, primary fibroblasts with varying repair
activities, derived from normal, CS complementation group B, and
XP complementation group C and group A subjects, were used. The
DNA repair phenotypes of these cells have been previously shown
to be similar to those of other cells derived from patients belonging
to the same complementation groups. Thus, similar repair kinetics
toward UV-induced photolesions have been shown for normal
human cell lines (VH25 and VH16; refs. 31, 32), XP-C cell lines
(XP21RO, XP1TE, and XP6RO; refs. 31, 32), CS-B cell lines (CS1AN
and 11961; ref. 33), and XP-A cell lines (XP12BE and XP25RO; ref.
34). Further support for a causal association between the repair
phenotypes of our cell lines and specific gene defects in the NER
pathway has been provided by complementation studies (35, 36).
In accordance with previous reports (17, 20, 23), monoadduct
accumulation continued for 2 hours beyond the end of the 1-hour
melphalan treatment (Fig. 2). This was probably caused by the very

rapid, active uptake of the drug (37, 38), which exceeds the rate of
its intracellular breakdown, in combination with the relatively slow
DNA repair beyond 1 hour. In contrast, after a 5-minute incubation,
lower drug uptake and much faster first-phase repair prevent
further accumulation of adducts (Fig. 3). ICL accumulated more
slowly and reached maximal levels within 8 hours, reflecting a slow
reaction of monoadducts with a site on the opposite strand. In the
present study, in the absence of NER, the maximal levels of ICL
corresponded to f15% of those of monoadducts (compare f5–
10% reported with naked DNA; refs. 23, 39).
In NER-deficient cells, adducts accumulated to similar levels in
all four genes, indicating that the state of transcription and local
chromatin condensation did not affect their formation. On the
other hand, substantial differences were observed immediately
following the end of the 1-hour melphalan treatment, during
which a large fraction of the total adducts expected to have been
formed were lost. Adduct loss subsequent to this time point was
relatively slow (t 1/2 f36–48 hours) and more or less similar in
the different genes and cell lines. The importance of the initial
phase of repair in determining the overall differences between the
different gene loci was confirmed by a more detailed examination
of repair kinetics following a 5-minute pulse of melphalan. This
confirmed the operation of very rapid repair (t 1/2 ranging from

<15 to f120 minutes), observable against all repair-proficient
backgrounds and resulting in removal of f50% to 80% of adducts
formed. As far as we are aware, no previous study has reported
such rapid NER of adducts. For example, Riou and colleagues (40)
found that UV-induced adducts were removed from normal
primary human fibroblasts with t 1/2 of f3 hours for 6-4PP and
f6 to 8 hours for CPDs.
The similarity of the fraction of melphalan adducts removed in
each phase from the different sequences suggests that the sharply
demarcated phases may reflect differential loss of adducts of
different chemical structures, although differences in conformation, sequence context, or cellular environment cannot be excluded
(3, 41, 42). The absence of adduct loss during the first 2 hours in
XP-A cells indicates that the early, rapid repair is mediated only by
NER (Fig. 3D). As far as the much slower, second phase of adduct
kinetics is concerned, limited loss from both strands of all genes
was apparent in XP-A cells (Fig. 2), compatible with the operation
of pathway(s) other than NER (e.g., base excision repair; ref. 43) or
spontaneous degradation.
In cells proficient in GGR and/or TCR, adduct loss during the
second kinetic phase seemed to be more extensive than in XP-A,
especially during the period 2 to 8 hours, although no consistent
pattern of variation in relation to the presence or absence of GGR
or TCR could be discerned. Whereas this kinetic pattern is
compatible with the contribution of NER to the second phase of
repair, it may simply reflect the tail end of the first phase of repair.
Our results indicate that melphalan adducts are substrates for
both NER subpathways, with GGR being more efficient than
TCR. On the other hand, the similarity of repair kinetics
(including strand-specific repair) in normal and CS-B cells
implies that, in the presence of GGR, TCR does not significantly
contribute to repair of the TS of active genes, in agreement with
a previous report (23). Similar observations have also been
reported for the repair of acetylaminofluorene-induced
8-deoxyguanosine adducts and UV-induced 6-4PP (10, 32),
suggesting that lesions capable of blocking transcription can
also be efficiently recognized by GGR and removed before TCR
can act on them. In the case of melphalan adducts, the
commonest sites of transcription termination have been reported
to be adducts at adenine residues located on the 3¶-side of A-A
pairs, and it has been suggested that the transcriptionterminating lesions may be intrastrand cross-links between
adjacent N3-A sites (44) or N3-A monoadducts (45, 46). Our
findings are consistent with either of these types of adducts
being targeted by GGR as well as, after transcription blockage,
by TCR.
A possible explanation for the lower efficiency of TCR could be
related to inhibition by melphalan adducts of RNA polymerase II–
mediated transcription, leading to impairment of TCR. We found
that, at melphalan concentrations higher than 20 Ag/mL, almost
complete inhibition of RNA synthesis and no recovery up to
24 hours were observed, accompanied by reduced TCR efficiency
(Fig. 4A–C). However, at lower melphalan doses, causing only
limited inhibition of RNA synthesis, no slowdown of TCR occurred.
This indicates that the reduced efficiency of TCR relative to GGR
and its inability to compete with the latter pathway after 10 Ag/mL
melphalan reflect an inherently lower efficiency of TCR and/or the
different adduct specificities of the two subpathways.
Although the efficiency of GGR was greater than that of TCR, the
cytotoxic effect of melphalan was greater in CS-B than in XP-C cells
(Fig. 1A). Examination of the effects on RNA synthesis showed a

www.aacrjournals.org

greater degree of inhibition and slower recovery in the former than
in the latter cell line (Fig. 1B), suggesting that TCR is more
important for survival than GGR by permitting faster transcription
recovery.
A notable finding of the present study is that the efficiencies of
both GGR and TCR varied in the order b-actin > p53 > N-ras >
d-globin (Fig. 3). This order of variation parallels that of the
transcriptional activity and local chromatin condensation at the
different gene loci (Fig. 1). The close association between
chromatin structure and GGR was further underlined by the
results of our studies involving a-amanitin: Following pretreatment
of CS-B cells with a-amanitin, chromatin condensation and the
efficiency of GGR in the b-actin, p53, and N-ras genes became very
similar to those of the silent d-globin gene (in which no change was
observed), whereas the overall repair of N-alkylpurines was
marginally reduced. Taken together, these results suggest that
increased accessibility of the DNA in transcribed chromatin
enhances GGR. Interestingly, biphasic repair kinetics and inhibition
of the early, rapid phase by a-amanitin were also observed for
O 6-methylguanine (25), which is repaired by a mechanism entirely
different from NER.
An influence of the state of transcription and of local chromatin
condensation on TCR and GGR has been previously reported. For
example, UV-induced CPDs in both the TS and NTS of exon 1 of the
DHFR gene of CHO cells are repaired more efficiently than adducts
in exons 2 and 5, and this variation qualitatively parallels the level
of local transcriptional activity (47, 48). Ours is the first study in
which a continuous, parallel variation, covering four different loci,
of the state of transcription and local chromatin condensation on
one hand, and the rates of both GGR and TCR on the other hand,
has been shown. Strikingly, the efficiencies of GGR and TCR varied
from gene to gene in a manner that was similar not only
qualitatively but also quantitatively (Fig. 4D). The association of
high transcriptional activity with increased TCR efficiency may be
attributed to higher numbers of RNA polymerase II complexes
acting as lesion detectors (49, 50). On the other hand, the
modulation of local GGR efficiency by the state of transcription
may be the result of active transcription being associated with an
open chromatin structure, which permits easier access to DNA
repair factors. The correlation shown in Fig. 4D suggests that
features of chromatin structure associated with transcription may
affect one or more factors involved in both NER subpathways.
These data are in agreement with the report of Bedoyan and
colleagues (51) suggesting that transcription, nucleosome stability,
and DNA repair in a yeast minichromosome may be mechanistically interdependent.
ICLs are among the most cytotoxic lesions because they
effectively prevent the separation of DNA strands and therefore
block essential cellular processes. Whereas the combined action of
NER and recombination has been proposed for the repair of ICL in
E. coli and yeast (7), ICL repair in mammalian systems is poorly
understood. De Silva and colleagues (52) found that XPF and
ERCC1 mutants (defective in NER) and XRCC2 and XRCC3
mutants (defective in Rad51-related homologous recombination)
were highly sensitive to the nitrogen mustard mechlorethamine.
Furthermore, Rothfuss and Grompe (53) provided evidence for a
refined model in which ICLs are recognized and rapidly incised by
ERCC1/XPF (‘‘unhooking’’ step) independent of DNA replication.
However, the incised ICLs are then processed further and doublestrand breaks form exclusively in the S phase. In the present study,
which involved confluent cells most of which were in G0-G1,

evidence for ICL unhooking was obtained as reflected by a slow
adduct decrease in cells active in either TCR or GGR. It is uncertain
whether this initial step of ICL repair in G0-G1 cells has a significant
role in resistance to melphalan toxicity.
In conclusion, our study has shown a parallel variation in the
transcriptional activity, chromatin condensation, and efficiency of
both TCR and GGR in different genomic loci and suggests that
features of chromatin structure that influence the local transcriptional rate also affect accessibility to both GGR- and TCR-related
repair factors.
