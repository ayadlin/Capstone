Myc Induces miRNA-Mediated Apoptosis in
Response to HDAC Inhibition in Hematologic
Malignancies
Clare M. Adams1, Scott W. Hiebert2, and Christine M. Eischen1

Abstract
Alterations in the expression or function of histone deacetylases
(HDAC) contribute to the development and progression of
hematologic malignancies. Consequently, the development and
implementation of HDAC inhibitors has proven to be therapeutically beneﬁcial, particularly for hematologic malignancies.
However, the molecular mechanisms by which HDAC inhibition
(HDACi) induces tumor cell death remain unresolved. Here, we
investigated the effects of HDACi in Myc-driven B-cell lymphoma
and ﬁve other hematopoietic malignancies. We determined that
Myc-mediated transcriptional repression of the miR-15 and let-7
families in malignant cells was relieved upon HDACi, and Myc

Introduction
Aberrant expression or function of histone deacetylases
(HDAC) has been implicated in hematopoietic malignancies
(1). Although HDAC inhibition (HDACi) induces tumor cell
death while leaving normal cells relatively unaffected, the
underlying mechanisms behind this remain unclear. Changes
in expression of survival genes were observed following HDACi
(1); however, whether these alterations resulted from hyperacetylation of promoters or altered expression of transcriptional mediators was not determined. HDACi also affects DNA
replication, likely from the inability to deacetylate histones at
replication forks (2, 3).
Myc, an oncogenic transcription factor, is dysregulated in most
hematopoietic malignancies (4). However, untransformed cells
undergo apoptosis to counter hyper-proliferative signals from
Myc dysregulation. Speciﬁcally, Myc overexpression activates the
p53 tumor-suppressor pathway, eliciting apoptosis (5, 6). Mycinduced apoptosis also occurs independent of p53 through downregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins, by an
indirect and unclear mechanism (7–9). Both pathways become
inactivated during tumorigenesis (10).

was required for their upregulation. The miR-15 and let-7 families
then targeted and downregulated the antiapoptotic genes Bcl-2
and Bcl-xL, respectively, to induce HDACi-mediated apoptosis.
Notably, Myc also transcriptionally upregulated these miRNA
in untransformed cells, indicating that this Myc-induced
miRNA-mediated apoptotic pathway is suppressed in malignant
cells, but becomes reactivated upon HDACi. Taken together,
our results reveal a previously unknown mechanism by which
Myc induces apoptosis independent of the p53 pathway
and as a response to HDACi in malignant hematopoietic cells.

Myc transcriptionally activates or represses numerous genes,
regulating many cellular processes (11). Myc represses proteincoding genes by recruiting HDACs and by binding and inhibiting
the transcriptional activator Miz-1 (11, 12). Myc also regulates the
expression of noncoding RNA, including miRNA that bind
mRNA, typically inhibiting translation (13). In malignant cells,
Myc represses many miRNA while speciﬁcally upregulating others
(13, 14). Although Myc-mediated transcriptional activation has
been extensively studied, mechanisms of Myc-mediated repression and their contribution to tumorigenesis are less understood.
Here, we describe a previously unknown miRNA-mediated
mechanism of Myc-induced apoptosis. We determined that cellular transformation status dictates whether Myc transcriptionally
activates or represses the miR-15 and let-7 families that target
antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, respectively. This apoptotic mechanism was inactivated in transformed hematopoietic cells, but
reactivated by HDACi. Our data reveal a general mechanism
underlying HDACi-mediated malignant hematopoietic cell death
and provide new insight into Myc-induced apoptosis.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, transfection, infection, and vectors
Daudi, Ramos, Raji, Su-DHL-6, and NIH3T3 cells were cultured
as described by the American Type Culture Collection. OCI-Ly-19
and OCI-Ly-3 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 containing 10%
FBS. P493-6 cells from Dr. Dirk Eick (Helmholtz-ZentrumMuenchen, Munich, Germany) were cultured as described (15).
Tetracycline (0.1 mg/mL; Sigma) was added to cultures of P493-6
cells for 24 hours to turn off MYC expression. Cell lines were
obtained between 2001 and 2007 and immediately frozen, so
cells were cultured for less than 6 months. Primary murine pre-B
cultures were generated and infected with retrovirus as previously
described (5; details in Supplementary Experimental Procedures).

miRNA Mediate HDAC Inhibition–Induced Apoptosis

Em-myc lymphoma cells were previously isolated and maintained
as published (16). Wild-type or p53/ murine embryonic
ﬁbroblasts (MEF) were generated and cultured as described
(6). Fibroblasts were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen). Retroviral infections of ﬁbroblasts were performed as previously reported (6). Vector/retrovirus details are
in Supplementary Experimental Procedures.
HDAC inhibition and cell growth and apoptosis assays
In vitro experiments utilized 1 mmol/L 4-hydroxytamoxifen
(4-OHT) or vehicle (EtOH), and 5 nmol/L depsipeptide (Celgene), 10 mmol/L RGFP966 (Repligen), or vehicle (DMSO).
Cell number and/or viability were determined by Trypan-Blue
Dye exclusion (triplicate) and proliferation by MTT (Sigma;
570 nm), MTS (Promega; 490 nm), or Alamar Blue (Invitrogen)
assays (quadruplicate). Apoptosis was evaluated by ﬂow cytometry following propidium iodide (sub-G1 DNA) or AnnexinV/
7-AAD staining.
Mice
For the in vivo lymphoma experiments, 10- to 12-week-old
C57Bl/6 (The Jackson Laboratory) mice were subcutaneously
injected (one ﬂank) with 4  106 Em-myc lymphoma cells as
previously described (17). Once tumors reached 200 mm3, Depsipeptide (2 mg/kg) or vehicle (DMSO) was intraperitoneally
injected. Mice were sacriﬁced at intervals for tumor evaluation.
Studies complied with state and federal guidelines and
were approved by the Vanderbilt Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee. Normal B cells were puriﬁed from spleens
of mice with the IMag Mouse B-Lymphocyte Enrichment Set
(BD Biosciences).
Human tissue
Normal human B cells were puriﬁed from leukoreduction
ﬁlters (Red Cross) and deidentiﬁed fresh spleens using the IMag
Human B-Lymphocyte Enrichment Set (BD Biosciences). Deidentiﬁed fresh spleen and frozen lymph nodes were obtained from
the Cooperative Human Tissue Network, following an Institutional Review Board approval as nonhuman subject research
(#150139).
Western blotting
Whole-cell protein lysates were prepared and Western blotted
as reported (6, 18). Fibroblasts were lysed 48 hours after
transfection.
Antibodies
Western blotting antibodies were as follows: Bcl-2, Bcl-xL (BD
Biosciences); Mcl-1 (Rockland); Bim (22–40; Calbiochem);
cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology); Myc, H3K9K14ac
(Millipore); H3K56ac, H4K5ac, H3, H4 (Abcam); Bax (N-20),
Miz-1 (H-190, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and b-actin (Sigma).
qChIP antibodies: Myc (N-262) and isotype controls (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), RNA polymerase-II (Ser2-phosphorylated;
Abcam), and H3K9K14ac (Millipore).
Quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation
Quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (qChIP) was
performed as previously described (19). Primer sequences and

Quantitative real-time PCR
RNA was isolated, cDNA was generated, and Sybr Green (SABiosciences) and TaqMan MicroRNA Assays (Applied Biosciences) were used for quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR;
triplicate) to measure mRNA and miRNA, respectively, as
previously described (16, 20). mRNA and miRNA expressions
were normalized to b-actin and RNU6b levels, respectively, and
presented as 2DDCt. Primer sequences in Supplementary Experimental Procedures.
Luciferase assays
NIH3T3 cells were transfected with luciferase reporters, b-galactosidase control plasmid, 50 nmol/L miR-15 or miR-195 miRIDIAN miRNA mimics or control RNA (Dharmacon/ThermoScientiﬁcBio), and/or 200 nmol/L miScript Target Protectors
(Qiagen). Luciferase and b-galactosidase activity was measured
as previously described (21).
Statistical analysis
Student t tests were used to statistically evaluate the data in
Figs. 1A and C, 2D–G, 3D and E, 4B–G, 5A–E, 6E, 7A, C, E, and F.
Wilcoxon rank-sum tests determined statistical signiﬁcance
for Figs. 2B and C, 3B, and 4A.

Results
HDAC inhibition decreases Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression,
inducing apoptosis in multiple hematopoietic malignancies
To evaluate the molecular events following HDACi, B-cell
lymphomas from Em-myc transgenic mice (Myc-driven B-cell
lymphoma model; ref. 22) and human Burkitt lymphoma lines
were treated with HDAC inhibitors. Depsipeptide (class-I
HDACi), RGFP966 (HDAC3i; ref. 23), RGFP233 (HDAC1/2i),
RGFP963 (HDAC1/2/3i), and Panobinostat (pan-HDACi) all
decreased cell expansion and number (Fig. 1A; Supplementary
Fig. S1A and S1B). Depsipeptide also reduced cell expansion in
nine other malignant human hematopoietic lines, including acute
myeloblastic leukemia (Kasumi), chronic myelogenous leukemia
(K562), acute T-cell leukemia (Jurkat, Loucy), cutaneous T-cell
lymphoma (Hut-78, MyLa), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (SuDHL-6, OCI-Ly-19), and multiple myeloma (H929; Supplementary Fig. S1C). Furthermore, HDACi decreased cell viability (Fig.
1A; Supplementary Fig. S1B) and increased caspase-3 cleavage
(Fig. 1B), characteristics of apoptosis.
To identify the molecular determinants of HDACi-mediated
apoptosis, we assessed expression of crucial prosurvival proteins.
Compared with vehicle control-treated cells, HDACi of murine and
human B-cell lymphoma cells decreased protein expression of
antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, but not Mcl-1 (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig. S1D). Moreover, depsipeptide treatment also decreased
Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins in nine other malignant hematopoietic
cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1D). Decreased Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL
mRNA (Fig. 1C) may explain the reduction in protein. Inhibiting
Bcl-2 and/or Bcl-xL reportedly kills malignant hematopoietic cells,
including lines we evaluated (24). Thus, HDACi speciﬁcally
decreased Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression, inducing apoptosis.

and Bcl-xL
HDACi-induced effects on histone acetylation were evaluated
to gain insight into the mechanism responsible for decreasing Bcl2 and Bcl-xL. Western blotting showed increased global histone

acetylation marks associated with active transcription in murine
and human lymphoma cells treated with depsipeptide or
RGFP966 (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. S2A). Analogous results
were obtained in the other nine malignant hematopoietic cell
lines tested (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
Histone acetylation is typically associated with gene activation,
yet Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL mRNA decreased after HDACi. To investigate
this, we examined precision global run-on transcription coupled
with massively parallel sequencing (PRO-seq; ref. 25) data for
BCL-2 and BCL-XL loci from Daudi cells treated for 4 hours
with depsipeptide or vehicle control (S.W. Hiebert, unpublished
data). This analysis showed no signiﬁcant expression changes
(increased or decreased) at these loci (Supplementary Fig. S2C),
suggesting a posttranscriptional mechanism is likely responsible
for the observed changes in Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL mRNA.
Therefore, we assessed expression of the miR-15 family (miR15a, -16-1, -195, -497) and let-7a, as these miRNAs posttranscriptionally target and negatively regulate Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL

expression, respectively, and induce apoptosis in multiple cell
types (Supplementary Fig. S3; ref. 26). Consistent with previous
reports (14, 27), miR-15 family and let-7a levels were decreased
in human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma cell lines compared with puriﬁed B cells and normal lymph
nodes (Fig. 2B). Similarly, B-cell lymphomas from Em-myc
transgenic mice also had reduced levels of these miRNA compared with levels in precancerous Em-myc splenocytes and
puriﬁed B cells (Fig. 2C).
Notably, HDACi increased miR-15a and miR-195 (representative miR-15 family members) and let-7a in lymphoma
cells (Fig. 2D; Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B). miR-31 levels
were unaffected, demonstrating not all miRNAs were upregulated
with HDACi. All other malignant hematopoietic lines evaluated
showed similar results (Supplementary Fig. S4C), indicating
this HDACi-induced effect is not cell-type speciﬁc. Furthermore,
with depsipeptide dose escalation, miRNA levels increased, indicating a dose response to HDACi (Supplementary Fig. S4D).

miRNA Mediate HDAC Inhibition–Induced Apoptosis

To evaluate whether the miR-15 family and let-7a were being
transcribed upon HDACi, we measured primary miRNA transcripts of the miR-15a/16-1 and miR-195/497 clusters and let-7a.
Following HDACi, these pri-miRNA transcripts increased (Fig.
2E). We next performed qChIP for RNA polymerase-II phosphorylated on serine 2 (RNAPII-p-Ser2), which is indicative of active
transcriptional elongation. HDACi resulted in RNAPII-p-Ser2
enrichment at miR-15 family and let-7a promoters in lymphoma
cells (Fig. 2F). Enrichment was not observed at regions upstream
of these promoters or in vehicle control–treated cells. In addition,
there was more RNAPII-p-Ser2 enrichment at miR-15 family and
let-7a promoters in depsipeptide-treated lymphoma compared
with normal lymphocytes (Supplementary Fig. S4E), indicating
increased transcription following HDACi in lymphoma. Thus,
HDACi in lymphoma activates transcription of the miR-15 family
and let-7a.
To determine whether the HDACi-induced increase in the miR15 family or let-7a was responsible for lymphoma cell death, we
retrovirally expressed the miRNA in two lymphoma lines. Lymphomas expressing the miR-15a/16-1 or let-7a clusters showed
reduced Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL protein, cell expansion, and viability, and
had increased caspase-3 cleavage, sub-G1 DNA, and Annexin V
positivity (Fig. 2G; Supplementary Fig. S4F–S4H). Thus, increased
levels of the miR-15 family or let-7a are sufﬁcient to induce
apoptosis in lymphomas.
In vivo HDAC inhibition increases miR-15 family and let-7a
levels, inducing lymphoma cell death
To extend our investigations in vivo, Em-myc lymphoma cells
were subcutaneously injected into C57Bl/6 mice. Once tumors
reached 200 mm3, mice were administered depsipeptide or vehicle control, and tumors were harvested at intervals. Analogous to
our in vitro results, HDACi increased active histone acetylation
marks (Fig. 3A) and levels of the miR-15 family and let-7a
(Fig. 3B), and decreased Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins (Fig. 3C).
Apoptosis was evident by caspase-3 cleavage, Annexin V positivity, and sub-G1 DNA (Fig. 3C–E). These data conﬁrm HDACi
activates miR-15 family and let-7a transcription that adversely
affect the expression of crucial prosurvival proteins, inducing
lymphoma cell apoptosis in vivo.
Myc transcriptionally upregulates the miR-15 family and let-7a
in untransformed cells
Myc transcriptionally activates speciﬁc miRNA while repressing
others in cancer cells (13, 14). To determine whether Myc mediated the repression of the miR-15 family and let-7a and/or their
induction following HDACi, we evaluated untransformed and
transformed cells with altered Myc levels. Unexpectedly, in contrast with transformed cells, Myc-overexpressing precancerous Emmyc spleens had increased miR-15 family and let-7a transcripts
compared with wild-type littermate spleens (Fig. 4A). miR-31
levels were analogous between genotypes, indicating Myc overexpression selectively increased speciﬁc miRNA in nontransformed cells.
We next assessed primary murine pre-B cells retrovirally expressing MycER, a 4-OHT–inducible Myc (28). Upon MycER activation with 4-OHT, miR-15 family and let-7a levels signiﬁcantly
increased compared with vehicle control-treated pre-B cells (Fig.
4B). This increase was analogous to that of miR-20a, a well-known
Myc-induced miRNA (13). Levels of miR-31 were unaffected.
Similar results were obtained following MycER activation in

www.aacrjournals.org

untransformed ﬁbroblasts (Supplementary Fig. S5A), indicating
this effect also occurs in nonhematopoietic cells. Addition of 4OHT to non–MycER-expressing pre-B cells or ﬁbroblasts had no
effect on miRNA levels (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Therefore, Myc
does not repress, but instead induces the miR-15 and let-7 families
in untransformed cells.
To determine whether Myc was transcriptionally activating the
miR-15 and let-7 families in untransformed cells, we utilized a
MycER mutant lacking the Myc-Box-II domain (MycDMBII-ER)
essential for Myc-mediated transcriptional activation (11). Levels
of the miR-15 family and let-7a were not induced following
MycDMBII-ER activation in wild-type MEFs, but were when transcriptionally competent MycER was activated (Fig. 4C). When
primary transcripts of the miR-15a/16-1 and miR-195/497 clusters and let-7a were evaluated, MycER, but not MycDMBII-ER,
induced their expression in MEFs and pre-B cells (Fig. 4D and E),
indicating Myc-mediated transcription was necessary to upregulate these miRNA.
To assess whether Myc was at the miRNA promoters and
whether active transcription was occurring, qChIP was performed.
qChIP for Myc in MycER-expressing MEFs revealed enrichment at
the promoter regions of the miR-15a/16-1 and miR-195/497
clusters and let-7a following 4-OHT–induced MycER activation
(Fig. 4F). Importantly, RNAPII-p-Ser2 and H3K9K14ac, indicators
of active transcription, were also enriched (Fig. 4F). No enrichment was observed at regions upstream of the miRNA promoters
or in vehicle control–treated cells. Similar qChIP results were
obtained in vivo when nontransformed precancerous Em-myc
transgenic spleens were compared with nontransgenic littermate-matched spleens (Fig. 4G), further demonstrating that Myc
transcriptionally upregulates these miRNA families in untransformed cells.
Myc is required for HDACi-induced miR-15 family and let-7a
transcriptional upregulation
To determine the role of Myc in repressing the miR-15 and
let-7 families in malignant cells, qChIP was performed on Mycoverexpressing murine and human lymphoma cells. Myc was
enriched at the promoters of both miR-15 family clusters and
let-7a in both cell lines, but not at upstream regions (Fig. 5A).
ENCODE MYC ChIP-seq data (29) also showed MYC at these
promoters in hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic malignancies and nontransformed human cells (Supplementary Fig.
S6A). Importantly, Myc was enriched at these same loci in
both the presence and absence of HDACi (Fig. 5A). Consistent
with Myc-mediated repression of these loci in lymphoma, there
was signiﬁcantly more enrichment of Myc at the promoter
regions of the miR-15a/16-1 and miR-195/497 clusters and
let-7a in lymphoma cells compared with normal lymphocytes
(Supplementary Fig. S6B).
Myc transcriptionally activates CAD and represses p21 (11),
consistent with the increase in RNAPII-p-Ser2 and H3K9K14ac
at CAD and the lack of enrichment at p21 we observed in
the lymphoma cells (Fig. 5B). Neither RNAPII-p-Ser2 nor
H3K9K14ac enrichment was detected at promoters of either
miR-15 family cluster or let-7a in the lymphomas (Fig. 5B).
Collectively, the data indicate Myc activates miR-15 family
and let-7a transcription in untransformed cells, whereas it
appears to repress their transcription in transformed cells.
Moreover, HDACi of B-cell lymphoma induced the miR-15
family and let-7a to levels similar to those in nontransformed

miRNA Mediate HDAC Inhibition–Induced Apoptosis

precancerous B cells overexpressing Myc (Supplementary Fig.
S6C). Furthermore, the derepression of the miR-15 family and
let-7a detected in lymphomas following 6 hours of HDACi did
not appear to be due to changes in Myc protein, as Myc levels
were similar for at least 12 hours after HDACi (Supplementary
Fig. S6D). Together, our data suggest HDACi converts Myc from
a transcriptional repressor into a transcriptional activator in
lymphoma.
To test whether Myc was required for HDACi-induced upregulation of the miR-15 family and let-7a, we utilized the human Bcell lymphoma line, P493-6, that expresses a tetracycline-regulatable MYC (15). With tetracycline present, MYC levels were
signiﬁcantly reduced and HDACi failed to increase miR-15a,
miR-195, or let-7a levels (Fig. 5C). Only when MYC was expressed
did HDACi increase their expression. Therefore, Myc was required
to mediate the HDACi-induced upregulation of the miR-15
family and let-7a. In addition, irrespective of HDACi, when MYC
expression was off, levels of the miR-15 and let-7 families were
slightly increased compared with when MYC was expressed,
providing additional evidence that MYC represses these miRNA
in lymphoma.
To further assess the requirements of MYC on miR-15 family
and let-7a expression, we performed qChIP with P493-6 cells.
When Myc was expressed, it was enriched at the miR-15 family
and let-7a promoters (Fig. 5D). Upon HDACi, enrichment of
RNAPII-p-Ser2 and H3K9K14ac (marks of active transcription)
at miR-15 family and let-7a promoters was only observed in
MYC-expressing cells (Fig. 5E). When MYC was not expressed,
a slight enrichment of RNAPII-p-Ser2 and H3K9K14ac was
detected at the miR-15 family and let-7a promoters, regardless
of HDACi (Fig. 5E). These data show that MYC mediated the
repression of the miR-15 family and let-7a and was required
for their HDACi-induced transcriptional upregulation.
Myc transcriptional activity is required to suppress Bcl-2 and
Bcl-xL expression
In untransformed cells, Myc suppressed Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL
expression, inducing apoptosis through an indirect, unresolved
mechanism (7, 8), purportedly through binding Miz-1 (9).
However, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins are overexpressed in the
majority of Em-myc B-cell lymphomas and human lymphomas
(8). Evaluation of Em-myc B-cell lymphomas compared with
normal B cells and spleens from precancerous Em-myc mice
conﬁrmed these results (Fig. 6A). In contrast, precancerous Emmyc spleens with increased Myc had reduced Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL
proteins compared with nontransgenic littermate-matched
spleens (Fig. 6B). Mcl-1 and Bax (proapoptotic Bcl-2 family
member) were unaffected. Similarly, in MycER-expressing pri-

mary pre–B cells and MEFs, decreases in Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were
detected following MycER activation (Fig. 6C). No change in
Mcl-1 or Bax expression was detected, whereas Bim, a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member upregulated by Myc (30), was
increased upon MycER activation (Fig. 6C). Therefore, with
elevated Myc, nontransformed cells decrease Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL
expression, whereas their expression is increased in transformed cells.
Myc associates with the transcription factor Miz-1 through a
motif requiring valine 394, reportedly suppressing Bcl-2 (9). To
investigate this, MycER harboring a point mutation (V394D)
disrupting the Myc:Miz-1 interaction (MycV394D-ER; Supplementary Fig. S7A; ref. 31) was expressed in wild-type MEFs.
Following MycV394D-ER activation with 4-OHT, Bcl-2 and
Bcl-xL were suppressed equivalently to cells expressing wild-type
MycER, ruling out a Miz-1–mediated mechanism (Fig. 6D).
Analogous data were obtained using p53-null MEFs (Supplementary Fig. S7B), consistent with prior results in p53-null myeloid
and B cells (7, 8). These data reveal a Miz-1– and p53-independent
mechanism for Myc-mediated suppression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL
expression. Moreover, MycV394D-ER effectively induced miR-15
family and let-7a expression (Fig. 6E), further supporting this
miRNA-mediated mechanism of Myc-induced suppression of
Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. In addition, evaluation of ChIP-seq data for
Miz-1 in four human and six murine cell lines/tissues (32–35)
showed Miz-1 enrichment at promoters of known Miz-1–regulated genes (e.g., VAMP4; Supplementary Fig. S7C). However,
Miz-1 was not enriched at the miR-15 family or let-7a promoters
in any of the cell lines/tissues evaluated, indicating Miz-1 does not
transcriptionally regulate these miRNAs.
To determine whether Myc transcriptional activity is
required to decrease Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression in normal
cells, wild-type MEFs expressing MycER or the transcriptionally inactive MycDMBII-ER mutant were evaluated. Following
4-OHT addition, decreased Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and increased Bim
expression were only observed in cells expressing wild-type
MycER and not MycDMBII-ER (Fig. 6F). Again, Mcl-1 and Bax
expression were unaffected. Therefore, Myc-mediated transcriptional activity is necessary for Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL downregulation.
Myc transcriptionally induces the miR-15 family and let-7a that

We reasoned that deﬁning the Myc-induced mechanism of
Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL downregulation in normal cells would provide
insight into the mechanism behind their downregulation
following HDACi. To test whether the reduction in Bcl-2 and
Bcl-xL was a direct consequence of Myc-induced upregulation of
the miR-15 family and let-7a in untransformed cells, luciferase

assays were performed in MycER-expressing ﬁbroblasts with
reporters harboring wild-type or mutated miRNA-binding sites
in the Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL 30 -untranslated region (30 -UTR). Following
MycER activation, luciferase activity decreased in cells containing the reporter with wild-type miR-15 family or let-7a–binding
sites in the Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL 30 -UTR, respectively (Fig. 7A). Luciferase activity remained unchanged in cells containing reporters
with mutated miR-15 family or let-7a–binding sites or cells
expressing the transcriptionally impaired MycDMBII-ER mutant
(Fig. 7A). A reporter containing the miR-17 family binding site
of the p21 30 -UTR served as a positive control, as p21 is a
validated target of the Myc-regulated miR-17 family (13). These
data indicate a novel mechanism where Myc transcriptionally
upregulates the miR-15 family and let-7a, which then target the
30 -UTR of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, respectively, leading to their downregulation in untransformed cells.
To further validate this mechanism, wild-type MEFs were
transfected with modiﬁed RNA molecules (Target Protectors)
designed to block the miR-15 family or let-7a from binding
their speciﬁc target sites in the Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL 30 -UTR, respectively. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins increased in wild-type MEFs
transfected with Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL Target Protectors, respectively,
as endogenous miR-15 family members and let-7a were unable
to bind and inhibit their expression (Fig. 7B). Combining the
Bcl-2 Target Protector with miR-15a overexpression, which
alone decreased Bcl-2 protein, rescued Bcl-2 protein expression
(Fig. 7B). Then, MycER-expressing ﬁbroblasts were transfected
with luciferase reporters, as described above, together with the
Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL Target Protectors. In the presence of Bcl-2 or
Bcl-xL Target Protectors, little, if any, decrease in luciferase
activity was detected following MycER activation (Fig. 7C).
Next, MEFs expressing MycV394D-ER (unable to interact with
Miz-1) were transfected with Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL Target Protectors.
MycV394D-ER activation decreased Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL protein
expression in the absence of any Target Protector (Fig. 7D).
However, levels of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL were maintained when Target
Protectors blocked the miR-15 or let-7 family binding sites,
respectively (Fig. 7D). Therefore, downregulation of Bcl-2 and
Bcl-xL upon Myc activation in untransformed cells was due to
induction of the miR-15 family and let-7a that bind the 30 -UTR
of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, respectively.
We then tested whether targeting of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL by the miR15 family and let-7a contributes to Myc-induced apoptosis,
independent of p53. MycV394D-ER was activated in p53-null
MEFs under reduced serum conditions with or without Target
Protectors. MycV394D-ER–activated MEFs containing Target Protectors had increased cell expansion and reduced cleaved caspase3 and Annexin V positivity (Fig. 7D–F). Thus, Myc induces the
expression of miR-15 family and let-7a independent of p53,
leading to apoptosis. Collectively, the data reveal a novel mechanism whereby Myc upregulates the miR-15 family and let-7a that
target Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in untransformed cells to trigger apoptosis,
and that this mechanism is reactivated in lymphomas following
HDACi.

Discussion
Although selective killing of tumor cells by HDACi is being
clinically tested and multiple effects have been noted, such as
altered expression of apoptotic genes and DNA damage (1–3), the
mechanism for its effects remains incompletely understood. Here,

we show HDACi switches Myc from a repressor to an activator of
miRNA that control the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, signiﬁcantly contributing to HDACi-mediated tumor cell death. We
identiﬁed a mechanism of HDACi-induced apoptosis that occurs
in Myc-driven B-cell malignancies and likely contributes to other
human cancers. Our data provide evidence of a novel Mycinduced miRNA-mediated mechanism of apoptosis that is present
in nontransformed cells, repressed in malignant cells, and reactivated in tumor cells upon HDACi.
It was previously postulated that HDACi kills myeloid leukemia cells through changes in expression of extrinsic apoptotic
pathway proteins (36). Others have reported that HDACi causes
global changes in gene expression that alter the apoptotic threshold in favor of cancer cell killing (37). Speciﬁcally, expression
proﬁling showed that HDACi altered mRNA levels of pro- and
antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, yielding a proapoptotic
signature in malignant cells (37). However, measuring stable
pools of individual or multiple mRNA as an indirect readout of
transcription would miss the posttranscriptional regulation of
gene expression. Our data reveal that increased miRNA transcription, rather than direct transcriptional repression, leads to downregulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL gene expression.
Likewise, other groups have reported HDACi-mediated changes
in miRNA expression (38–41). For example, HDACi of a breast
cancer line changed the expression of 27 miRNA within 5 hours,
including let-7a (38). However, they reported downregulation of

www.aacrjournals.org

let-7a, whereas we detected increased let-7a upon HDACi; this
discrepancy may be due to differences in the cell types evaluated or
the HDAC inhibitors used. Importantly, our results indicate that
HDACi-induced changes in Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were mediated by
Myc. Myc is overexpressed and/or dysregulated in most human
malignancies and is essential in cancers driven by other oncogenes, such as mutant Ras (4, 42). Thus, our data, providing a
molecular link between Myc, miRNA, and Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, yield
new insights into the transforming action of Myc and suggest how
this pathway can be targeted therapeutically. Moreover, our work
suggests that the expression of these miRNA may be useful
biomarkers for HDACi sensitivity.
Due to previous reports that Myc repressed miRNA in malignant cells (14, 27), we were initially surprised when Myc induced
the expression of the miR-15 family and let-7a in untransformed
cells. However, Myc overexpression drives cancer cell proliferation, but triggers apoptosis in untransformed cells (4). Myc
induces apoptosis by activating the p53 pathway and simultaneously downregulating Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL mRNA expression
through an indirect mechanism (7, 8), reportedly involving
Miz-1 (9). Myc expression did not change the half-life of Bcl-2
(7); therefore, we suspected a transcriptional or posttranscriptional mechanism. The miR-15 family and let-7a were known to
target Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, respectively, contributing to apoptosis
(26), so we investigated whether a connection between Myc, these
miRNA, and Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL downregulation existed. Indeed, Myc

Myc induces the miR-15 family and let-7a that then target Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. A and C, luciferase expression vectors containing the 30 -UTR of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL with the wildtype (WT) or a mutated (Mut) miRNA-binding site were transfected into ﬁbroblasts expressing the 4-OHT–inducible MycER or MycDMBII-ER. An expression vector
containing the miR-17 family binding site in the wild-type p21 30 -UTR was a positive control (13). Luciferase activity was measured (triplicate)
48 hours following vehicle (EtOH) control or 4-OHT addition to activate MycER. A b-galactosidase reporter plasmid was cotransfected for normalization. B–F, miR-15

suppressed the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL independent of its
interaction with Miz-1 and of p53, which can itself transcriptionally repress Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression (43, 44). Transcriptionally competent Myc was required for the reduction in Bcl-2
and Bcl-xL and the induction of the miR-15 and let-7 families.
Moreover, open chromatin and activated RNA polymerase-II
were observed at the miRNA promoters in Myc-overexpressing
untransformed cells. Luciferase reporter assays conﬁrmed that
Myc induced the miR-15 family and let-7a, which directly
targeted Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL 30 -UTRs, respectively. By inhibiting
the miR-15 family from binding Bcl-2 and let-7a from binding
Bcl-xL, the decrease in Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL following Myc activation
was blocked. Combined, our data provide strong evidence that
in untransformed cells, Myc induces the miR-15 family and
let-7a that then target Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, respectively, triggering
apoptosis. These results reveal a novel miRNA-mediated mechanism of tumor suppression that is activated in normal cells
upon Myc dysregulation.
Our data indicate that Myc transcriptionally activates the miR15 family and let-7a in untransformed cells, while transcriptionally repressing them in transformed cells. In lymphoma cells, Myc
was present at miR-15 family and let-7a promoters, which were
closed and transcriptionally inactive, indicating that Myc was

likely mediating this repression, as had been reported (14). Our
data from multiple hematopoietic malignancies indicate HDACs
contributed to the repression of both miR-15 family clusters and
let-7a, as repression was relieved following HDACi, resulting in
transcriptional upregulation of these miRNA, which required
Myc. The HDAC3-selective inhibitor RGFP966 induced miR15a and let-7a to an equal extent as the class-I HDAC inhibitor
depsipeptide and the more speciﬁc HDAC1/2/3 inhibitor
RGFP963 did, suggesting HDAC3 may be the primary HDAC
involved in mediating the repression. Consistent with these
results, others have reported HDAC3 is speciﬁcally involved with
repression of miR-29a/b/c and miR-15a/16-1 in B-cell and mantle-cell lymphoma lines, respectively (41, 45). Moreover, Myc is
reported to recruit HDAC3 to the promoters of protein-coding
genes and miRNA to repress their expression (12, 41, 45). However, RGFP233, the HDAC1/2 inhibitor, also increased levels of
miR-15a and let-7a, indicating that they may also contribute to
the repression. Although how Myc and HDAC interactions contribute to tumorigenesis remains unresolved, our data suggest that
Myc, together with HDACs, alters the epigenome, leading to
repression of miRNA and possibly other genes whose expression
results in cancer cell apoptosis. HDACi relieves the transcriptional
repression of the miR-15 and let-7 families in malignant

hematopoietic cells, resulting in transcription of these miRNA,
which targeted Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, killing the cancer cells.
Furthermore, hematopoietic cell lines with either mutant or
wild-type p53 showed analogous results, indicating HDACiinduced effects are independent of p53 status. Given the p53
pathway is inactivated and Myc is dysregulated in most human
cancers (4, 46), our results identify a new potentially therapeutic
avenue to induce apoptosis that capitalizes on Myc and is independent of p53. Of note, overexpression of Bcl-2 and/or Bcl-xL
protected from HDACi-induced cell death (47–50), supporting
our conclusion that miRNA targeting these genes leads to apoptosis. Our studies have identiﬁed a novel mechanism of Mycinduced apoptosis that capitalizes on miRNA to suppress the
expression of crucial prosurvival proteins. While this mechanism
is inactivated in malignancies through epigenetic alterations
involving HDACs, we have shown that it can be reactivated by
HDACi. Our current study provides a novel mechanism that
underlies HDACi-mediated cell death and offers new insights
that should aid in improving cancer therapies.
