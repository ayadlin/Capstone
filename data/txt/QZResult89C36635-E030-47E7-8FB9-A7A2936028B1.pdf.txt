Abstract
BACKGROUND—Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a significant problem
for cancer patients, and there are limited treatment options for this often debilitating condition.
Neuromodulatory interventions could be a novel modality for patients trying to manage CIPN
symptoms; however, they are not yet the standard of care. This study examined whether
electroencephalogram (EEG) neurofeedback (NFB) could alleviate CIPN symptoms in survivors.
METHODS—This was a randomized controlled trial with survivors assigned to an NFB group or
a wait-list control (WLC) group. The NFB group underwent 20 sessions of NFB, in which visual

and auditory rewards were given for voluntary changes in EEGs. The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)
worst-pain item was the primary outcome. The BPI, the Pain Quality Assessment Scale, and EEGs
were collected before NFB and again after treatment. Outcomes were assessed with general linear
modeling.
RESULTS—Cancer survivors with CIPN (average duration of symptoms, 25.3 mo), who were
mostly female and had a mean age of 62.5 years, were recruited between April 2011 and
September 2014. One hundred percent of the participants starting the NFB program completed it
(30 in the NFB group and 32 in the WLC group). The NFB group demonstrated greater
improvement than the controls on the BPI worst-pain item (mean change score, −2.43 [95%
confidence interval, −3.58 to −1.28] vs 0.09 [95% confidence interval, −0.72 to −0.90]; P 5 .001;
effect size, 0.83).

CONCLUSIONS—NFB appears to be effective at reducing CIPN symptoms. There was evidence
of neurological changes in the cortical location and in the bandwidth targeted by the intervention,
and changes in EEG activity were predictive of symptom reduction.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common side effect of cytotoxic
cancer therapy and has been described as one of the most debilitating because it negatively
affects quality of life and function. The vast majority of cancer survivors who receive
neurotoxic chemotherapeutic agents (taxanes, platinums, vinca alkaloids, and bortezomib)
develop CIPN at some point during therapy.1,2 The incidence of CIPN 1 month after
chemotherapy is estimated to be as high as 71% to 96%.3 Most survivors will have some
resolution of symptoms over time4; however, even 6 months after treatment, 30% of those
receiving platinum-based chemotherapies and as many as 80% of those receiving paclitaxel
therapy continue to suffer from CIPN.4,5 To date, most treatments for CIPN are not effective,
and the mechanisms by which these clinical impairments are alleviated remain allusive.6 In
fact, 15 trials sponsored by the National Cancer Institute showed that only 1 pharmaceutical
agent, duloxetine, provided positive results, whereas agents in the remaining 14 trials failed
to treat or prevent neuropathic symptoms.6–8 With the increasing numbers of cancer
survivors, there is an urgency for finding effective treatments for chronic CIPN.

Although it is common knowledge that there are certain brain regions and pathways
activated in a variety of pain conditions (sometimes called the pain matrix), we do not have
an effective understanding of when and how to intercept those pathways to alleviate pain.
Techniques for pain modification include cognitive behavioral therapy, hypnosis, distraction,
and coping skills training.9–11 There is, however, growing interest in brain/computer
interface techniques; the idea is that modification of the source of the pain perception (the
brain) will relieve symptoms.12–14 One of these techniques, electroencephalogram (EEG)
neurofeedback (NFB), has successfully treated a variety of health issues, including pain

conditions.15,16 NFB takes advantage of the learning process by providing feedback to the
participant about the workings of his or her own brain in real time. Sensors are placed on the
participant’s scalp at appropriate locations. Participants choose a game that rewards them for
changing their brainwave activity under the sensors. Feedback is both auditory and visual
(an emotionally neutral picture appears on the screen and is accompanied by a simultaneous
auditory beep when participants successfully modify their brain activity). By targeting
changes in brain regions that are active during pain conditions such as CIPN, NFB can teach
participants to interpret pain signals differently.

Author Manuscript

Because CIPN is a significant problem for cancer survivors with very limited effective
treatments, we conducted a trial to compare a neuromodulatory intervention (NFB) with a
usual-care control (wait-list control [WLC]) with the primary outcome being pain related to
CIPN. We hypothesized that NFB participants would demonstrate both significant
reductions in neuropathic symptoms in comparison with those in the WLC group and
changes in neural activity associated with the specificity of NFB training protocols and that
changes in neural activity would predict changes in CIPN symptoms.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design

Author Manuscript

The current randomized, wait list–controlled trial investigated the efficacy of NFB at treating
CIPN, examined the neural correlates associated with NFB, and explored whether changes
in brain electrical activity predicted changes in CIPN. The study was approved by the
institutional review board of The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center
(MDACC) in Houston, Texas. Measurements were taken at the baseline and within 5 days of
the final session of NFB.
Participants

Author Manuscript

Participants were recruited from the MDACC database of survivors as well as MDACC
physician referrals. The diagnosis of CIPN was made by the attending oncologist on the
basis of the symptom history and a physical examination. Written consent was obtained
before participation. The inclusion criteria were as follows: participants were 18 years old or
older, had at least a grade 3 neuropathy rating according to the National Cancer Institute’s
grading criteria (version 4, 2010) and/or reported CIPN-related moderate to severe pain
(score of 4 or higher) on a numeric rating scale (0–10, with 10 being the worst), and had
symptoms of neuropathy for a minimum of 3 months after the completion of chemotherapy.
Participants with any cancer type or stage were eligible. Participants with neuropathic
symptoms from any cause other than chemotherapy (eg, diabetes) were excluded. Other
exclusion criteria included central nervous system disease or a history of bipolar disorder,
schizophrenia, or antipsychotic medication usage. Concurrent uses of medications to treat
neuropathic pain were allowed, but an increase in medications or changes in the types of
medications were not allowed during the course of NFB treatment.

Procedures

Author Manuscript

The NFB group received 20 sessions of NFB over a maximum of 10 weeks; this required
minimum participation of twice weekly. To eliminate the likelihood of symptoms improving
because of the passage of time, we obtained data from the WLC group and the NFB group at
the same time points. The WLC group was offered NFB once the study was complete. To
ensure that we were measuring pain related to CIPN, our study participants were specifically
instructed to rate their pain with respect to neuropathy (and not back pain, for example). In
addition, the oncologist had to agree that the participant’s symptoms were related to CIPN.
EEG Recording

Author Manuscript

An EEG was recorded for each patient with an amplifier (Mitstar, St. Petersburg, Russia).
The data were collected with a 19-electrode EEG cap, cleared of all artifacts, and processed
offline (Eureka! software; NovaTech EEG). Data were collected for 10 minutes in the eyesopened condition and in the eyes-closed condition (sampling rate, 256 Hz); the band passed
from 0.5 to 64 Hz. Impedances were reduced below 5 kΩ. Participant data were then
processed to result in a quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG), from which NFB
training protocols were derived.
NFB

Author Manuscript

Participants were seated in an upright position in a comfortable chair and instructed to watch
the computer monitor as if they were watching a television. Electrodes were placed on each
participant’s scalp at appropriate locations as designated by the qEEG-based protocols. The
NFB challenge was such that participants were required to keep the amplitude of a desired
EEG waveform above a certain threshold while inhibiting the amplitude of other, less
desired waveforms. Participants played a game lasting 45 minutes, which consisted of an
emotionally neutral picture appearing on the screen that was accompanied by a simultaneous
auditory beep when a participant matched the thresholds (EEG amplitudes, for example)
programmed in the software and determined by the qEEG. When a participant did not match
the thresholds programmed in the software, the game paused, and no auditory or visual
feedback was given. Feedback occurred approximately 78% of the time that the participants
increased the amplitude of their EEG reward band (ie, when they increased it 8–12 Hz [or
α]) while decreasing the amplitude of the inhibit band or bands. For NFB, we used EEGer
software (EEG Education and Research, Granada Hills, Calif).
Measures

Author Manuscript

Pain—For the primary aim, the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) short form was used to assess
the severity of pain and its impact on daily functioning.17 The BPI short form is a validated,
self-administered questionnaire widely used to assess the severity of pain and the impact of
pain on daily functioning among patients. The BPI was designed to measure 2 key aspects of
pain: sensory and reactive. Both dimensions use a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale, with 10
being the worst. A composite of 4 pain items is represented by the pain severity score,
whereas a composite of 7 daily activities is represented by the pain interference scale.18 We
chose the worst-pain subscale of the BPI as our primary outcome because it has been used as

an outcome measure in trials of treatments for CIPN, has a high degree of reliability and
validity, and has been shown to be valid when it is used as a single item.18
Secondary endpoints were changes in other CIPN-related symptoms, such as average pain,
pain severity, activity interference, and affective interference (BPI) and pain unpleasantness,
tingling, numbness, intensity, tenderness, surface pain, and deep pain (measured with the
Pain Quality Assessment Scale [PQAS]). The PQAS is a 20-item measure developed to
quantify the quality and intensity of neuropathic pain. It was derived from the Neuropathic
Pain Scale and includes descriptors common to people with neuropathic pain.19 Items are
scored as standalone measures, and a global score is not recommended. Participants
complete rating scales from 0 to 10 to describe their experience over the past week on
average.

Author Manuscript

Clinically important change has been defined as a raw point decrease ranging from 1.74 to 2
with the BPI.1 Considering that other studies have set a precedent of a change as low as 0.98
as a minimally important difference,1,18 we chose a 2.0-point decrease in the symptom
report to be our definition of clinically meaningful.
EEG neuroimaging—The qEEG analysis included absolute and normalized spectra and a
comparison of individual data with a normative database (Institute of the Human Brain, St.
Petersburg, Russia). The qEEG was reviewed in 6 frequency bands: δ (1.5–3.5), θ (4.0–7.5),
α (8.0–12.0), low β (13.0–16.0), high β (13.0–32.0), and γ (35.0–45.0). The qEEG was the
basis for the NFB protocol design, for which protocols were created by the comparison of
statistics from the normative database with the statistics from participants on an individual
basis. We used low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) to evaluate neural
correlates of the placebo response to NFB.20

Statistical Analysis

Author Manuscript

Subjective report of neuropathy—With a sample size of 30 evaluable participants per
group (assuming a 20% attrition rate), we had 80% power to detect differences that were at
least 0.74 standard deviations between groups. Because this was a pilot study, we had no
preliminary data to suggest what a realistic between-group difference (or corresponding
effect size) would be. However, the power analysis adds support because it allows a good
chance of detecting a medium to large effect size. To identify changes in symptom reports
associated with NFB, we performed a general linear model regression (GLM) controlling for
age, baseline scores, the current use of medication for neuropathy, and the length of time
with neuropathic symptoms with NFB versus WLC as a between-subjects factor. The GLM
demonstrates that the observed data can be predicted from the model with 1 or more
predictors and a continuous response variable.25 Effect sizes were computed through a
comparison of pre-and postchange scores between groups with Cohen’s d.26 The primary
study endpoint was the change in worst pain (BPI) from the baseline to the end of the

treatment period (20 NFB sessions). Secondary endpoints were changes in other CIPNrelated symptoms measured with the BPI and PQAS, and they were also calculated with our
GLM. In summary, our dependent variable was the change in worst pain as measured by the
BPI; our independent variable was the group; and our covariates were age, baseline scores,
current use of medication for neuropathy, and length of time with neuropathic symptoms.
Patients were randomized by minimization and assigned to a group via a computer.
Participants were treated per protocol, and analyses were performed with IBM SPSS
Statistics for Windows (version 22.0).

EEG neuroimaging—Neuroimaging targeted 3 outcomes: patterns of activation in 9
predesignated areas of the cortex (frontal left, midline, right, central [left, midline, and
right], and posterior [left, midline, and right]) to determine cortical changes based on NFB,
regions correlated with the worst-pain change scores to identify potential mechanisms of
training-related changes, and an evaluation of 3 regions known to be active in placebo
analgesia to determine to what degree the effects of NFB could be attributed to a placebo.

Author Manuscript

EEG records were manually artifacted and analyzed with Eureka! software (NovaTech
EEG). The mean amplitude, power, and absolute values were exported into SPSS for
statistical analysis. When it was applicable, the data were transformed with Ln(x) or Ln(x
+ 1) to produce a more Gaussian distribution. We confirmed that our data were normalized
by an examination of Q-Q box plots before the analysis. θ/β and α/β ratios were calculated.
A multivariate analysis (analysis of variance; group × time and group × time × region) was
conducted to assess baseline and pre-post differences between groups for each frequency
band and measure (eyes closed and relative power).25 Our dependent variable was relative
EEG power. To correct for multiple comparisons, Bonferroni corrections were applied.27 We
report relative power indices because relative power shows smaller interindividual variability
than absolute power does28; this potentially allows a more accurate comparison of the power
indices between epochs and electrodes, and they are commonly used to design
neuromodulatory approaches to treating pain conditions. To explore the association between
brain activity and NFB associated with the modulation of pain, a Pearson correlational
analysis was performed between the cortical amplitude, power, relative power, and α/β
power ratios and the change scores for worst pain.

Author Manuscript

Because this study did not have a placebo arm, we explored changes in regions of interest
(ROIs) known to be active with a placebo and to what degree effects of NFB could be
attributed to a placebo. The current source density was averaged across all voxels in an ROI,
and we controlled for baseline activation across all frequency bands; then, the current source
density activity was compared between groups. Our predetermined ROIs included the insula,
the anterior cingulate cortex, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These areas have been
shown to be active with placebo analgesia and to contribute to the descending pain control
system.

RESULTS
Seventy-five patients were approached for the study between April 2011 and September
2014, and 71 participants were randomized. Five dropped out from the NFB group before

any NFB sessions and 4 dropped out from the WLC group before follow-up for a total
participation of 30 patients in the NFB and 32 patients in the control group. Of the 30
participants in the NFB group who started treatment, 100% completed all 20 sessions and
provided follow-up data. The average age of the participants was 62.5 years; most were
female (87%) and white (77.5%); and most were breast cancer survivors (73%) with an
average length of time since chemotherapy of 25.3 months. Six participants in the NFB
group and 6 in the WLC group did not report a pain rating of at least 4 points as measured
by the BPI at the baseline. Fifty-one percent were not taking a medication to treat
neuropathic symptoms at the time of study entry, and the chemotherapy regimens mainly
involved a taxane agent (72%; Table 1). There were no statistically significant differences
between groups at the baseline in age, length of time of neuropathic symptoms, type of
chemotherapy, stage of disease, ethnicity, employment or marital status, education level,
disease type, or percentage taking medications for CIPN or in any of the outcome measures.

Author Manuscript

By the end of the treatment period, the NFB group demonstrated a significantly greater
decrease in worst pain, our primary outcome (mean change score, −2.43; 95% confidence
interval [CI], −3.58 to −1.28), than the control group (mean change score, 0.09; 95% CI,
−0.72 to −0.90; P = .001) with an effect size of 0.83.
Similar group differences were found for secondary outcomes, including average pain (NFB,
−2.2; 95% CI, −3.22 to −1.17; WLC, 0.13; 95% CI, −0.55 to −0.80; P = .001; effect size,
0.88) and pain interference (NFB, −1.86; 95% CI, −1.01 to 2.71; WLC, −0.02; 95% CI,
−0.80 to 0.84; P = .009; effect size, 0.66). Analyses demonstrated statistically significant
differences in 3 other subscales of the BPI (Table 2).

Author Manuscript

With the PQAS, group differences were noted for unpleasantness (NFB, −3.27; 95% CI,
−4.26 to −2.27; WLC, −0.65; 95% CI, −1.26 to −0.03; P = .000; effect size, 1.17) and 19
other subscales (Table 2). No adverse events were reported.
After treatment, there was a significant group × time interaction in which the NFB group
presented with significantly increased α activity (P = .021) and decreased β activity (P = .
021); this was not seen in the control group. An increase in the ratio of α to β was seen after
NFB (Fig. 1A). There was a significant difference between groups in α relative power at the
baseline: α was lower in the treatment group. However, after treatment, the NFB group was
able to surpass the WLC group in α relative power (Fig. 1B). There was a decrease in β in
both groups; however, the magnitude of the decrease was larger in the NFB group than the
WLC group (Fig. 1C).

Author Manuscript

Results from an analysis of changes in self-reported pain and brain activity revealed
significant correlations between decreased worst-pain reporting (BPI) and a reduction of β
power (13–45 Hz) in the right (r = −0.39; P = .04) and left parietal cortices (r = −0.38; P = .
04) and the frontal (r = −0.47; P = .01), central (r = −0.44; P = .02), and parietal midline
regions (r = −0.42; P = .03). There were no significant associations between increases in α
(8–12 Hz) activity or the α/β power ratio and worst-pain reporting.
A LORETA analysis demonstrated that in a comparison of the NFB and WLC groups at the
end of treatment, both groups showed differences in activity in regions previously thought to

contribute to the placebo effect. Specifically, the NFB group showed more activity in the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI), −3, 53, 23; t = 2.15)
than the WLC group did; however, the WLC group showed more activity in the insula (MNI,
35, −5, −1; t = −1.63) than the NFB group, and neither group showed differences in the
rostral anterior cingulate cortex (MNI, 16, 34, 14; Fig. 2).

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

To date, this pilot study is the largest clinical trial to determine effects of neuromodulation in
cancer survivors. Furthermore, for survivors suffering from CIPN, a common side effect of
chemotherapy for which effective treatments remain elusive, we have demonstrated that
NFB appears to be an effective symptom-control strategy. For the primary outcome of worst
pain, we found statistically and clinically significant reductions for the NFB group versus
the WLC group. Importantly, we also saw significant improvements in all domains of
secondary outcomes, including nonpainful neuropathic symptoms such as numbness and
tingling.

Author Manuscript

We analyzed changes in brain activity in relation to NFB and in association with pain
outcomes. We found statistically significant differences over time and between groups
within the frequency bands (α and β) and the scalp locations that we were training. This
indicates that NFB training can be specifically directed to particular areas of the cortex and
that the cortex responds accordingly, even specifically to the electrical frequency trained.
Previous EEG and pain literature suggests that α frequencies are key to a reduction in the
severity of symptoms.29 Interestingly, self-reporting of pain was correlated only with a
reduction of fast wave activity (β) and was not associated with increases in α or in the ratio
of α to β. We conclude that NFB is a targeted intervention with measureable brain and
behavioral outcomes.

Author Manuscript

As of June 14, 2016, we found 269 randomized controlled trials; however, none of these
trials showed the efficacy of complementary modalities in treating CIPN, although a few
showed incidental improvements.30 Although there are many neuroleptic agents that have
demonstrated efficacy in neuropathic pain due to other etiologies such as diabetes
(gabapentin and pregabalin), duloxetine is the only pharmaceutical that has shown a
significant benefit for CIPN and is the only agent recommended by American Society of
Clinical Oncology guidelines31; otherwise, there is no consistent evidence supporting any
pharmaceutical’s efficacy in treating CIPN symptoms. In the registration trial of duloxetine
for CIPN, which also examined effects in any cancer type and after paclitaxel, taxane, or
oxaliplatin treatment, the mean reduction in the average-pain ratings was 1.06 for duloxetine
and 0.34 for a placebo with a moderate effect size of 0.51.1 However, the use of duloxetine
was associated with fatigue and nausea and had a dropout rate of 12%.1 In our study, the
mean decrease in average pain with NFB was 2.2 points with an effect size of 0.88. We did
not note any negative side effects, and patients attended 100% of the treatment sessions.
One limitation of the current study is that we did not have a placebo group. Because of this,
we analyzed regions of the brain that are shown to be active in placebo analgesia, including
regions of the brain that are associated with patient-reported outcomes during placebo

conditions.32 Our results suggest that although the placebo effect may be a factor in this
study, it was not the only factor leading to improvements in symptoms. Also, although the
brain analyses used a Bonferroni correction, the results should still be considered
exploratory and should be interpreted with caution.

Author Manuscript

Another limitation is that most of our participants were female and breast cancer survivors,
so future research should investigate the efficacy of NFB by chemotherapy type. An
investigation is also needed that includes a sham NFB intervention to elucidate the exact
mechanisms of NFB. Other questions to investigate include the role of NFB in the
prevention of CIPN and other cancer pain conditions, the effectiveness of NFB in acute pain
settings, and the role of NFB in symptom management both during and after active cancer
treatment. Lastly, medications given for CIPN could affect the EEG; however, our
participants had symptoms even though they may have been on medications, and there were
no differences between the 2 groups in the number of participants taking CIPN medications
at the baseline.
Because of the prevalence of CIPN in the cancer survivorship population and the dearth of
effective therapies, the clinical implications of our findings are readily apparent. NFB is
safe, portable, complementary to other treatment regimens, and relatively inexpensive. EEG
NFB appears to be effective at reducing CIPN symptoms and could potentially treat
neuropathy due to other conditions; especially because pharmaceuticals that treat CIPN may
have side effects of their own, it is important to consider treatments that minimize or
eliminate additional adverse effects for especially vulnerable populations with already
existing comorbidities.
