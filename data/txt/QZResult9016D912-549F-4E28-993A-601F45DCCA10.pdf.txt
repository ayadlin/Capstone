Invasive Prostate Carcinoma Driven by c-Src and Androgen
Receptor Synergy

Abstract
Cellular Src (c-Src) integrates a large number of signal transduction pathways regulating cell division,
migration, and other aspects of cell physiology. Mutations of Src kinase have not been described in human
prostate cancer, but evidence for increased levels of expression accompanying cancer progression has been
reported. We analyzed overexpression of c-Src in naïve mouse prostate epithelium and observed no change in
tubule formation frequency or histologic structure. However, when enhanced c-Src expression is coupled with
enhanced expression of androgen receptor (AR), it results in a strong activation of Src kinase activity
accompanied by activation of the MAPK pathway, and enhanced AR activity. Similar to the pathology induced
by constitutively active c-Src(Y529F), the tubules progress to frank carcinoma with invasion and display markers
of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. These combined results suggest that nonmutated Src kinase may play a
more important role in the genesis and progression of prostate cancer than previously appreciated and that
epigenetic changes that enhance the level of AR may select for enhanced expression of c-Src with accompanying
activation and a strong drive to malignant progression. Cancer Res; 71(3); 862–72. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancerrelated deaths among males in the United States. The pathologic stages of prostate cancer begin with abnormal epithelial
proliferation and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) with
progression to invasive carcinoma and eventually metastatic
disease (1). While early localized disease is usually curable, the
survival rate drops to only 34% with progression to invasive
and metastatic disease. In advanced patients, a therapeutically
intractable castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) often
emerges (2).
Initiation of prostate cancer has been linked to activation of
AKT signaling due to loss or mutation of PTEN, as well as
aberrant expression of erythroblast transformation specific
(ETS) family transcription factors following chromosomal
translocation (3–5). Additionally, overexpression of androgen
receptor (AR), c-MYC, polycomb group protein EZH2, and
antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 also seems to be important to this
process (6, 7). In contrast, the genetic and epigenetic altera-

tions that drive progression to invasive and metastatic disease
are poorly understood. Alterations in the expression and
activation state of AR have been identified in CRPC. Over
80% of CRPC cases present with high levels of AR expression.
This is thought to increase the sensitivity of AR to low levels
of androgen following castration or by other endogenous
steroids (8).
Various experimental and human cancers have shown that
Src can be activated by mutation or DNA amplification
mechanisms (9, 10). Src kinase is overexpressed and activated
in a wide variety of human cancers, including metastatic or
hormone-refractory prostate cancer (10, 11). However,
because activating mutations of Src kinase are rare in human
cancer (12, 13), it is not well-appreciated how the activation of
Src kinase contributes to the initiation of invasive carcinoma
in prostate cancer.
Src kinase regulates several upstream molecular signaling
components including numerous G-protein coupled receptors, integrins, and receptor tyrosine kinases. The activation of
Src kinase contributes to prostate tumorigenesis through
activation of downstream signaling pathways including
PI3K-Akt, RAS, integrin-FAK, MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), and STAT3 signaling (14, 15). Therefore, as a
pleiotropic activator, Src kinase regulates numerous cell signaling pathways important for survival, proliferation, invasion,
migration, and angiogenesis of cancer cells (15, 16).
In addition to the clinical observation that expression of AR
and Src is often elevated in CRPC (10), several studies provide
further evidence that Src kinase can interact with AR signaling
pathways. Guo and colleagues (11) reported tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of AR by Src kinase. Cell culture
studies using the LNCaP cell line indicate that the association
between Src kinase and AR is mediated through the receptor

Invasive Carcinoma and EMT Induced by Activated Src

for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) scaffold protein (17). This Src
kinase–AR interaction is modulated by the AR antagonist
DOC-2/DAB2 protein (18).
We have previously established a prostate-regeneration
system in which prostate tissue can be regenerated in vivo
by combining dissociated postnatal prostate epithelia with
dissociated embryonic urogenital sinus mesenchyme, and
engrafting these cells under the kidney capsule of immunodeficient mice (19). The expression of specific oncogenes can
be manipulated in this system to monitor both the influence of
cell autonomous and extrinsic signals on the initiation and
progression of prostate cancer (19, 20). This system allows for
chronological investigation of prostate cancer development,
in which prostate tissue can be regenerated from defined
cellular populations based on the expression of defined surface markers (4, 21).
We show that overexpression of wild-type Src kinase alone
does not change prostate tubule structure, whereas enhanced
coexpression of c-Src and AR results in invasive prostate
carcinoma with associated epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT). This combination leads to strong activation of Src
tyrosine kinase activity accompanied by activation of the
MAPK pathway, and enhanced AR activity. The in vivo progression to undifferentiated adenocarcinoma and EMT by
constitutively active Src(Y529F) kinase closely resembles the
observed phenotype from coexpression of wild-type Src kinase
and AR. To evaluate the dynamic process of invasive carcinoma, we used a tetracycline inducible system in concert with
the prostate regeneration system and found that the initiation
of invasive carcinoma was coupled with dynamic alterations
in prostate tubule structure associated with changes of epithelial and EMT markers.

Material and Methods
Plasmids
The open-reading frame of murine Src kinase, its constitutively active mutant Src(Y529F), and kinase dead mutant
Src(Y529F/K298M) were cloned into lentivector FUCRW (22), in
which RFP expression is constitutively active and regulated by
the CMV promoter. Src(Y529F) was also cloned into pTK380
(23) lentivector, designated as TRE-Src(Y529F), in which the
expression of Src(Y529F) was regulated by the addition of Dox.
Prostate regeneration and prostate epithelial viral
infections
The regeneration process, lentivirus preparation, titering,
and infection of dissociated prostate cells were performed as
described previously under University of California, Los
Angeles, safety regulations for lentivirus usage (19). Housing,
maintenance, and all surgical and experimental procedures
were undertaken in compliance with the regulations of the
division of Laboratory Animal Medicine of the University of
California, Los Angeles. Prostate regeneration in Dox inducible system was adapted from previous reports (19). Dissociated prostate cell suspension was prepared from 6- to 10week-old R26-M2rtTA mice, which express an optimized form
of reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator (rtTA-M2)

protein (24). Dissociated cells were infected with lentivirus
TRE-Src(Y529F). Infected cells [(1–2)  105] were mixed with
urogenital sinus mesenchymal cells [(1–2)  105]. Grafts were
implanted under the kidney capsule in SCID mice and allowed
to regenerate for 4 weeks. The drinking water contained 0.2%
Dox and 1% sucrose and was changed every week until the
termination of the experiment.
Cellular analysis of coexpression of Src(WT) and AR
To characterize activation of FAK/ERK pathways following
expression of constitutively active Src and Src(WT)þAR
in vitro, 293T cells (purchased from American Type Culture
Collection) were infected with lentivirus carrying overexpression of AR, Src(WT), Src(Y529F), or coinfected with lentivirus
carrying overexpression of AR and Src(WT) together. Two days
after infection, 293T cells were harvested and protein lysates
were prepared using RIPA buffer supplemented with phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 1 and 2 (P5726 and P2850, SIGMA).
The expression of AR, Src, pSrc, pFAK, pERK, and ERK was
analyzed by Western blot (Antibodies are listed in Supplementary Table S1).
Immunohistochemistry
Transillumination or fluorescent images were taken with a
dissecting microscope. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was as
described previously (19, 21). The primary antibodies and
dilution are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
Dasatinib inhibits active Src kinase–induced invasive
carcinoma and EMT
The prostate cells infected with vector control or active
Src(Y529F) lentivirus were mixed with UGSM and implanted
under the kidney capsule of CB.17SCID/SCID mice for prostate
regeneration. Three days after implantation, SCID mice were
randomized to receive dasatinib or control vehicle. For p.o.
administration, dasatinib was dissolved in 80 mmol/L citrate
buffer (pH 3.0) with 5% DMSO. A concentration of 15 mg/kg
body weight/day was given p.o. at 24-hour intervals, using a
20-gauge gavage needle. The control group of mice was given
an equal volume of diluent buffer by gavage. Mice were treated
for 4 weeks.

Results
Overexpression of wild-type Src kinase synergizes with
AR in prostate tumorigenesis
Src kinase and AR are two commonly upregulated genes in
metastatic prostate cancer or CRPC (8, 10, 11). We asked if
forced expression of wild-type Src kinase and AR together in
naïve prostate epithelial cells could promote invasive prostate
tumorigenesis in vivo. Cell autonomous overexpression of AR
resulted in the formation of histologically normal prostate
tubules (Fig. 1A), though, as reported previously, regenerated
tissues contained fewer tubules than vector controls (data not
shown). Regenerated tissues derived from overexpression of
Src(WT) resulted in the formation of normal-appearing or
slightly hyperplastic tubules (Fig. 1A). In contrast, regenerated
tissues infected with Src(WT)þAR exhibited sheets of

cytoplasmic ratio and grew as solid sheets, cords, small nest,
and single cells, characteristic features of a poorly differentiated or undifferentiated high-grade carcinoma (Fig. 1A). The
expression of Src(WT)þAR correlates with the histologic
differentiation status of transformed regions. Lower ectopic
expression of Src(WT)þAR corresponded to more differentiated lesions, whereas higher levels of Src(WT)þAR were
associated with poorly differentiated lesions that exhibited
higher levels of pSrcY416 and pAR (Ser210/213; Supplementary Fig. S1). Additionally, tumorigenic cells that expressed
high levels of Src(WT)þAR showed extensive invasion into the
adjacent stroma (Fig. 1A).
Enhanced expression of wild-type Src kinase and AR
elevates the activity of AR and Src kinase
One possible mechanism for the observed synergy of Src
(WT) and AR could be through cross-activation of Src kinase
and AR (17). IHC confirmed that tumorigenic areas of the
Src(WT)þAR regenerated tissue expressing elevated Src kinase
and AR (Fig. 1B, Supplementary Fig. S2). Whereas the expression level of Src kinase in the Src(WT)þAR tumor was similar
to that in Src(WT) group (Fig. 1B, Supplementary Fig. S2),
tumor cells overexpressing Src(WT)þAR exhibited elevated
levels of activated Src kinase [detected by antibody reactive
with pSrc(Y416)], activated AR [detected by antibody reactive with pAR(Ser213/210)], cyclin D1, and phosphotyrosine
(detected by 4G10; Fig. 1B, Supplementary Fig. S2), suggesting
that wild-type Src kinase and AR mutually coactivate.
Synergy of wild-type Src kinase with AR displays an
expansion of luminal-like tumor cells with associated
EMT
To identify the epithelial subpopulations present in the
neoplastic lesions, the tissue was stained for epithelial markers, cytokeratin CK5 and CK8. Regenerated tubules from Src
(WT) or AR groups presented a normal double layer of CK8þ
luminal cells and CK5þ basal cells, whereas tumorigenic cells
from Src(WT)þAR grafts displayed only CK8þ cells (Fig. 1C).
We further stained for E-cadherin and vimentin and observed
that some CK8þ tumor cells also expressed both E-cadherin
and vimentin. In contrast, E-cadherin, but not vimentin, was
expressed in the epithelial cells in Src(WT) or AR groups
(Fig. 1C). Collectively, these data indicate that overexpression
of wild-type Src kinase synergizes with AR, which leads to
activation of Src kinase and results in invasive prostate
carcinoma and possible EMT.
Coexpression of Src(Y529F/K298M) and AR can
promote transformation
An open conformation of an Src kinase dead mutant
[Src(Y529F/K298M)] was created and coinfected with AR in
the prostate-regeneration assay. Regenerated tissues derived
from overexpression of Src(Y529F/K298M) resulted in the formation of normal-appearing tubules. In contrast, regenerated
tissues from the Src(Y529F/K298M)þAR group exhibited welldifferentiated carcinoma displaying expression of CK5/CK8
and E-cadherin (Fig. 2A and B). IHC confirmed that expression
of total Src kinase was increased in Src(Y529F/K298M)-

D1 were increased in the Src(Y529F/K298M)þAR group
(Fig. 2C) in comparison with Src kinase dead mutant or AR
alone, suggesting that when both are co-overexpressed, Src
kinase scaffold activity can still promote AR activity and
malignant progression, but to a lesser degree than wild-type
Src plus AR. Similar experiments were conducted with Src
(K298M) expressed alone or in concert with AR. A modest
degree of synergy was seen in converting normal epithelium
toward PIN and well-differentiated carcinoma but less dramatically than the Src(Y529F/K298M) plus AR combination (data
not shown). These combined results suggest that some of the
biological activity derives from the scaffold function of Src,
whereas more potent effects require an active kinase.
Expression of constitutively active Src kinase in
prostate epithelial cells phenotypically resembles
coexpression of wild-type Src and AR
Because cross-talk between AR and c-Src could lead to the
activation of Src kinase signaling, we asked whether constitutively active Src(Y529F) alone phenocopies the synergy of
Src(WT)þAR in the initiation of invasive adenocarcinoma and
EMT. Overexpression of active Src(Y529F) kinase is known to
induce sarcomatous transformation of fibroblast cells (9).
Therefore, we isolated prostate basal epithelial cells based
on the antigenic profile Lin-CD49fþSca-1þ (Supplementary
Fig. S3), which were previously reported to enrich for prostate
basal stem cells (21). Regenerated tissue derived from mAKTinfected prostate epithelial cells showed PIN lesions displaying
expression of CK8 in luminal cells and CK5 in basal cells, and
these epithelial cells also expressed E-cadherin but not vimentin (Fig. 3A and B). In contrast, similar to tumors derived from
Src(WT)þAR, regenerated tissue derived from Src(Y529F)infected epithelial cells lacked glandular structures and were
composed of sheets of poorly differentiated carcinoma cells
with focal sarcomatoid areas (Fig. 3A). The primary pattern of
Src(Y529F)-induced tumors consisted of large tumor cells with
abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, and highly pleomorphic
vesicular nuclei (Fig. 3A). Cells derived from Src(Y529F) tumor
displayed CK8 and vimentin but not CK5 and E-cadherin
(Fig. 3B), or CK18 but not CK14 (data not shown). To examine
the invasiveness of Src(Y529F)-induced tumors, we further
analyzed the junction between the graft and host kidney
tissue. CK8/CK18þ tumor cells expressing vimentin were
present in the glandular tissue of the kidney at the invasive
front, identified by high E-cadherin expression (Fig. 3B). This
suggests that transformed cells showed luminal epithelial
features with mesenchymal differentiation. Collectively, these
data indicate that similar to Src(WT)þAR, Src(Y529F) was
capable of inducing invasive tumors from naïve murine prostate epithelial cells.
Synergy of Src(WT)þAR or constitutively active Src
kinase alters the expression of well-characterized EMT
markers and increases the expression of MMP9
EMT is an important step in the initiation of invasive
tumorigenesis. During EMT, tumorigenic cells acquire the
expression of transcription factors such as Twist and Snail
as well as cell-surface protein N-cadherin (25). Therefore, in

addition to the altered expression of E-cadherin and vimentin
(Figs. 1C and 3B), we further examined the expression of these
well-characterized markers of EMT in active Src(Y529F) and
Src(WT)þAR-induced carcinoma. Active Src(Y529F)-induced
tumors expressed increased level of Twist in the cell nucleus in
comparison with the normal regenerated tubules and the
mAKT-transformed tumors (Fig. 4A). In addition, both mAKT
and active Src(Y529F)–induced tumors expressed increased
levels of Snail and N-cadherin (Fig. 4A). Src(WT)þAR-induced
tumor expressed increased levels of N-cadherin, Snail, and to a
lesser extent Twist (Fig. 4A). These data provide further
evidence that Src(WT)þAR or active Src(Y529F)–induced
invasive adenocarcinoma that can progress to EMT in vivo.
A major characteristic of invasive cancer is the secretion of
matrix metalloproteinases, which can degrade extracellular
matrix and permit the migration of cancer cells. Therefore,
we further examined the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) as an indication of invasive adenocarcinoma.
MMP9 expression was polarized in the cytoplasm of

mAKTþAR tumor cells from our previous study (control), likely
localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex
(Fig. 4B). Compared with the expression of MMP9 in the normal
regenerated tubules, tumorigenic cells derived from Src(WT)þ
AR show increased levels of intracellular MMP9, whereas Src
(Y529F) tumors exhibit both intra- and intercellular staining,
suggesting the capacity to degrade the extracellular matrix
(Fig. 4B). Collectively, these data suggest that expression of Src
(WT)þAR or active Src(Y529F) results in phenotypically similar
invasive carcinoma and associated EMT characteristics.
Synergy of Src(WT)þAR or constitutively active
Src(Y529F) leads to activation of MAPK signaling
pathway
The Src/FAK signaling pathway has been shown to regulate
EMT (26). We further investigated if the MAPK signaling
pathway is activated in tissues derived from Src(WT)þAR or
active Src(Y529F) by examining the expression and activation
of proteins within this pathway. Tumors from Src(WT)þAR

and active Src(Y529F) expressed increased levels of phosphoFAK as compared to normal regenerated tubules and mAKTtransformed tumors (Fig. 5A). Src(WT)þAR, active Src(Y529F),
and mAKT-transformed tumors also expressed elevated pErk
in comparison with the regenerated normal prostate tubules
(Fig. 5A).
To further characterize functional interactions between
Src kinase and AR signaling pathways, we co-overexpressed
Src(WT) and AR in 293T cells and interrogated the activation
of Src kinase and MAPK pathway (Fig. 5B). Cells overexpressing the combination of Src(WT)þAR showed enhanced
expression of pSrc416, pFAK, and pErk compared with cells
expressing either Src(WT) or AR alone. However, activation of
these signaling cascades is lower in the context of Src(WT)þ
AR than constitutively active mutant Src(Y529F). This suggests that enhanced coexpression of Src(WT) and AR can
activate the MAPK pathway, although to a lesser extent than
constitutively active mutant Src(Y529F).
Inducible regulation of active Src kinase reveals

architecture (27, 28). To study the dynamic progression of
invasive carcinoma in vivo, we used doxycycline (Dox)-regulated expression of active Src(Y529F) in the prostate regeneration model (Supplementary Fig. S4A). The Dox-regulated
phospho-Src expression was confirmed in a cell culture (Supplementary Fig. S4B and C). We allowed normal prostate
regeneration to proceed for 4 weeks before inducing the
expression of Src(Y529F). Subsequently, the grafts were harvested at 6, 8, or 10 weeks after Dox induction or without Dox
at 10 weeks (Fig. 6A). As expected, the transformed cells
expressed AR and elevated levels of Src or phospho-Src kinase
in the grafts induced by Dox (Fig. 6C and D).
In the control, TRE-Src(Y529F)-infected tubules (RFPþ)
showed normal histology with dilated tubular structures
composed of two cell layers (Fig. 6B). In contrast, regenerated
tissues with temporal induction of Src developed from poorly
differentiated carcinoma with focal glandular differentiation
(tubular formation), to no obvious glandular differentiation,
and to sarcomatoid transformation with focal areas of spindle
cell morphology (Fig. 6C). The invasive prostate carcinoma
regressed when the expression of active Src(Y529F) was turned
off by Dox withdrawal (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Interestingly, the tumor cells of regenerated tissues from
the þDox-treated group did not express the basal marker CK5

at any time point analyzed (Fig. 6D). In contrast, luminal
marker CK8 was expressed in tumor cells of regenerated
tissues from 6-week and 8-week groups, but not from the
10-week group (Fig. 6D). The induced expression of active Src
kinase triggers a progression of EMT as demonstrated by loss
of E-cadherin expression on the cellular membrane and
increase in vimentin expression in the cytoplasm (Fig. 6D).
Collectively, these data illustrate that overexpression and
activation of Src kinase causes normal tubules to progress
to prostate intraepithelial neoplasia, then to frank carcinoma
with invasion with markers of EMT in vivo.
Dasatinib inhibits active Src kinase–induced invasive
carcinoma and EMT
Dasatinib, a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting Src family kinases and several receptor kinases, showed
a favorable inhibitory effect on bone metastasis in advanced
CRPC patients (29, 30). We examined if dasatinib could
inhibit invasive carcinoma and EMT induced by the
activation of Src kinase. A mock treatment of grafts from
the Src(Y529F) group [Src(Y529F)þmock] generated solid,
bulky RFPþ tissue, whereas dasatinib-treated Src(Y529F)
grafts [Src(Y529F)þdasatinib] had less weight and rare RFP

signal (Fig. 7). Our data indicate that dasatinib effectively
inhibits active Src kinase–induced invasive carcinoma and
EMT in vivo (Supplementary Figs. S6 and S7).

Discussion
The sequence of genetic alterations and molecular signal
transduction pathways required to drive progression to invasive adenocarcinoma in vivo is largely unknown (1). Studies
demonstrate that at least two genetic events are required for
efficient progression from high-grade PIN toward locally
invasive adenocarcinoma (31, 32). We have previously shown
that overexpression of AR in combination with either high
levels of ERG, an ETS family transcription factor, or elevated
mAKT promotes the development of a poorly differentiated
adenocarcinoma (4, 22). Our study reveals that activation of
Src kinase pathways by increased coexpression of AR and Src
kinase can induce undifferentiated invasive adenocarcinoma
in vivo in the absence of activating mutations. We demonstrate that enhanced coexpression of c-Src/AR in vivo phenotypically resembles overexpression of constitutively active
Src(Y529F) kinase. Our data indicate that clinical observations of increased AR expression and activation of Src family

kinase may be functionally relevant to the progression of
invasive carcinoma of the prostate (10, 15, 33).
Activation of AR-responsive pathways likely contributes
to the observed synergistic effect of Src/AR coexpression.
Our Src/AR coexpression experiments demonstrate elevated levels of serine phosphorylation on AR, which is
associated with nuclear translocation and activation of
AR responsive transcription (34). While not directly
assessed in our model, Guo and colleagues (11) reported
that Src kinase can mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of
AR. This indicates that Src kinase can modulate AR activity
directly through tyrosine phosphorylation and indirectly
through activation of serine/threonine kinase pathways
(35). Additionally, our results suggest that Src kinase
may in part promote AR activity input through its function
as a scaffold protein. High levels of Src kinase dead mutant
can enhance FAK catalytic activity (36) and decrease
osteopetrosis in the src/ animal model (37). Further,
AR contains a proline-rich domain that could be a potential
binding site for the SH3 domain of Src kinase.
We demonstrate that both constitutively active Src(Y529F)
and the synergistic coexpression of Src/AR present features of
EMT and strong activation of MAPK pathways. These observations indicate that progression of EMT is associated with
alterations in prostatic glandular structure, increased inva-

sion, and higher cancer grade (27). Activation of MAPK
signaling pathways provides a potential mechanism for
EMT driven by Src activity. Induction of the Src/FAK/ERK
pathway promotes endocytosis of E-cadherin, which could
modulate cellular adhesion ability (38). Activation Ras/MAPK
pathway has also been shown to regulate the expression of
Snail and Slug transcription factors, which in turn regulate Ecadherin transcription (39).
Progression to CRPC is largely fatal due to strong resistance
to currently available therapies (2). Increased levels of activated Src kinase present in a subset of CRPC cases (10), in
combination with our evidence supporting functional relevance, indicate that inhibition of Src kinase could provide a
useful therapeutic approach in CRPC treatment. Dasatinib, a
small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was recently shown
to efficiently target Src family kinases and several other
receptor tyrosine kinases (29, 40). In a clinical study of patients
with advanced solid tumors, dasatinib therapy alone was
reported to be acceptable and well tolerated with some
preliminary evidence of efficacy (41). Additionally, phase I
and II studies of CRPC patients treated with a combination of
dasatinib and docetaxel show a reduction in the size and/or
number of existing bone lesions (42, 43). Our study shows that
dasatinib inhibits invasive carcinoma and EMT induced by
expression of constitutively active Src kinase. However, cooverexpression of Src kinase dead mutant and AR could still
promote AR activation and lead to well-differentiated carcinoma. These data suggest that an increase of AR activity can
be partly independent of Src kinase activity.
Various groups are investigating AR antagonists as a means
of targeting CRPC. Screening for transcriptional signatures of
high AR activity using genomic expression analysis is currently
being evaluated in patients with metastatic CRPC. This could
be used to identify candidate CRPC patients for AR-targeted
therapy using nilutamide, a nonsteroidal antiandrogen (44).
The in vivo synergy of c-Src and AR and activation of AR
independent of Src kinase activity presented in this study,
along with the therapeutic value of independently targeting
Src kinase and AR pathways seen in clinical trials and in
common practice, suggests that simultaneous targeting of
both pathways represents a potentially effective therapy for
prostate cancer.
Finally, Mendiratta and colleagues (45) reported heterogeneous AR and Src activity in localized prostate cancer and
metastatic CRPC samples. The study identifies a subset of
patients exhibiting both high Src and AR activity even in
localized prostate cancer (45). Characterization of these
patient subsets could provide a means to select patients to
treat in earlier phases of prostate cancer.
