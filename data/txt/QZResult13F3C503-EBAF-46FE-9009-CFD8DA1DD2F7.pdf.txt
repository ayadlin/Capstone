Abstract
Metastasis is responsible for 90% of cancer-related deaths. Strategies are needed that can inhibit the capacity of
cancer cells to migrate across the anatomic barriers and colonize distant organs. Here, we show an association
between metastasis and expression of a type I receptor tyrosine kinase–like orphan receptor, ROR1, which is
expressed during embryogenesis and by various cancers, but not by normal postpartum tissues. We found that
expression of ROR1 associates with the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), which occurs during
embryogenesis and cancer metastasis. Breast adenocarcinomas expressing high levels of ROR1 were more likely
to have gene expression signatures associated with EMT and had higher rates of relapse and metastasis than
breast adenocarcinomas expressing low levels of ROR1. Suppressing expression of ROR1 in metastasis-prone
breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231, HS-578T, or BT549, attenuated expression of proteins associated with EMT
(e.g., vimentin, SNAIL-1/2, and ZEB1), enhanced expression of E-cadherin, epithelial cytokeratins (e.g., CK-19),
and tight junction proteins (e.g., ZO-1), and impaired their migration/invasion capacity in vitro and the metastatic
potential of MDA-MB-231 cells in immunodeﬁcient mice. Conversely, transfection of MCF-7 cells to express ROR1
reduced expression of E-cadherin and CK-19, but enhanced the expression of SNAIL-1/2 and vimentin. Treatment
of MDA-MB-231 with a monoclonal antibody speciﬁc for ROR1 induced downmodulation of vimentin and
inhibited cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro and tumor metastasis in vivo. Collectively, this study indicates
that ROR1 may regulate EMT and metastasis and that antibodies targeting ROR1 can inhibit cancer progression
and metastasis. Cancer Res; 73(12); 3649–60. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Metastasis is responsible for 90% of cancer-related deaths
(1, 2). This process includes the physical translocation of
primary tumor cells across anatomic barriers to distant organs
with subsequent colonization (1, 3, 4). Some poor prognostic
gene signatures suggest that cells in some primary tumors are
predisposed to metastasis (1–3, 5, 6). Recent attention has
focused on a cell biologic program called epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is thought to factor prominently in tumor self-renewal, progression, and metastasis
(1, 4, 7, 8). EMT confers on neoplastic epithelial cells, the traits
required for invasion and metastasis (4). In both normal
development and metastasis, EMT seems to be regulated by
contextual signals that epithelial cells receive from their
microenvironment (9). Through the use of multiple pathways

involved in embryonic morphogenesis and wound healing,
cancer cells also can concomitantly acquire attributes that
enable invasion and metastasis (10). Furthermore, work to
deﬁne cancer stem cells (CSC), which may account for relapse
after therapy, has identiﬁed a variety of traits that are associated with one or more subpopulations of CSCs within various
tumors (1, 4). Some studies have found that non-CSCs can
become CSC-like cells upon acquiring characteristics of cells in
EMT (11, 12). As such, cancer cells that undergo EMT may
exhibit a CSC phenotype and acquire invasive properties that
promote extravasation, angiogenesis, self-renewal, and uncontrolled growth at metastatic sites (3, 4, 13).
Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) play critical roles in cell
differentiation, proliferation, angiogenesis, and migration (14–
16). In this regard, RTK-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) is an
evolutionarily conserved, type-I membrane protein that is
expressed during embryogenesis (14, 17). The ROR1 homolog
in C. elegans, Cam-1, is required for cell migration, polarity, and
asymmetric cell divisions (18). In mammalian development,
ROR1 is expressed by neuroprogenitor cells (NPC), which
adopt properties of mesenchymal cells that migrate to the
neocortex (19). Suppressed expression of ROR1 in NPCs causes
their precocious differentiation into neurons, which have
reduced migratory potential (20).
ROR1 is also expressed by a variety of different cancers (21),
but not by normal postpartum tissues (22–25). Although ROR1
might have little if any detectable tyrosine kinase activity

(23, 26), functional data indicate that ROR1 can contribute to
noncanonical WNT signaling to promote neoplastic cell survival (22). This is noteworthy, as noncanonical WNT signaling
apparently plays a role in breast cancer metastasis (16). We
found that approximately a third of human breast cancer cases
expressed high levels of ROR1, which was associated with
activation of AKT, cAMP response element-binding protein
(CREB), and enhanced tumor cell growth (21, 27). Here, we
examined whether ROR1 factors in breast cancer metastasis.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, HS-578T, BT549,
MDA-MB-435s, MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-157, MDA-MB-134,
MCF7, BT-474, MDA-MB-453, SKBR3, MDA-MB-330, BT-483,
and T47D were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection and maintained as described (28). The LM2-4175
and BoM-1833 metastatic sublines of MDA-MB-231 cells were
gifts from Joan Massague (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center, New York, NY).
Silencing of human ROR1
Silencing of ROR1 was achieved by targeting the sequences
50 -TCCGGATTGGAATTCCCATG-30 (shRNA1), and 50 - CTTTACTAGGAGACGCCAATA-30 (shRNA2) as described (27; see
Supplementary Methods).
Analysis of metastasis
MDA-MB-231, LM2-4175, or BoM-1833 were subcutaneously
injected into the second mammary fat pad, the tail-vein, or
cardiac chamber of female RAG/g c/ mice. Tumor growth
and metastasis were monitored via bioluminescence imaging,
measured as photons per second per centimeter squared per
steradian (p/s/cm2/sr; see Supplementary Methods).
Gene expression analysis from GEO datasets
We analyzed the published microarray datasets of 582
patients in the PubMed GEO database as previously described
(see Supplementary Methods; ref. 29).
See Supplementary Methods for detailed methods and
references.

Results
ROR1 associates with metastatic cancer phenotypes
We examined for ROR1 in 14 distinct breast cancer epithelial
cell lines, including 6 basal-type lines and 8 luminal-type lines.
Each of the basal-type lines expressed ROR1, which generally
was not expressed by luminal-type lines. Moreover, the high
expression of ROR1 was associated with aggressive tumor
phenotypes such as triple-negative ERNegPRNegHER2Neg and
high-level migration/invasion capacity (Supplementary Table
S1 and Supplementary Fig. S1; ref. 30).
ROR1 is associated with early metastatic relapse in breast
adenocarcinoma
We interrogated the PubMed GEO database on cancer cells
of 582 patients with breast adenocarcinoma (29). Approximately two-thirds (426/582) of these patients did not have

3650

detectable cancer in the regional lymph nodes at the time of
surgery and were not administered adjuvant therapy. The
remaining cases had detectable disease in regional lymph
nodes and received adjuvant therapy. Among 582 cases, 46%
relapsed (n ¼ 270) and had a median metastasis-free survival
time of 22.1 months. We segregated patients into 3 groups
based upon their relative cancer cell expression of ROR1.
Patients with tumors having the upper-third level of ROR1
mRNA expression (ROR1H) had a signiﬁcantly shorter metastasis-free survival than patients with tumors that had the
lower-third level (ROR1L) or intermediate-level (ROR1M) of
ROR1 (P < 0.0001; Fig. 1A). Moreover, patients with ROR1H
tumors had higher rates of metastasis to lung (P ¼ 0.002), bone
(p ¼ 0.004), or brain (P ¼ 0.04) than did patients with ROR1L
or ROR1M breast cancers; (Supplementary Fig. S2). ROR1H
cancers had signiﬁcantly lower proportions of tumors with
favorable prognostic features such as estrogen/progesterone
receptors or HER2, than cancers with ROR1L or ROR1M (Supplementary Table S2). High-level expression of ROR1 was also
carried out as an independent factor in predicting shorter
metastasis-free survival (Supplementary Table S3). Patients
with ROR1H tumors had a higher rate of metastasis, earlier
relapse, and poorer survival than patients with ROR1L/M
tumors, irrespective of ER, PR, or HER2 status (Supplementary
Fig. S3). Furthermore, interrogation of the GSE2034, GSE2603,
GSE5327, and GSE12276 array data for EMT gene signatures in
breast cancer revealed that ROR1L tumors had signiﬁcantly
higher expression levels of genes associated with epithelial
cells, such as CDH1 (encoding E-cadherin), TJP1 (encoding
ZO1), and TJP3 (encoding ZO3), but lower expression levels of
genes associated with mesenchymal cells, such as SNAI2
(encoding Snail-2), ZEB1 (encoding ZEB-1), CDH2 (encoding
N-Cadherin), or VIM (encoding vimentin), than ROR1H tumors
(Fig. 1B).
ROR1þ breast cancer cell lines
We suppressed expression of ROR1 in basal-type breast
cancer cell lines (e.g., MDA-MB-231) using short-hairpin RNAs
(shRNA), which targeted either of 2 different sequences in
ROR1. Expression of ROR1 protein was inhibited in cells
transfected with either ROR1-shRNA1 or ROR1-shRNA2, in
contrast to cells transfected with a control shRNA (CTRLshRNA; Supplementary Fig. S4A). Interrogation of the array
data for gene expression differences between MDA-MB-231
transfected with CTRL-shRNA or ROR1-shRNA (GEO accession: GSE31631) revealed that cells silenced for ROR1 had
higher expression levels of KRT19 (encoding CK19), and lower
expression levels of CXCR4 and VIM than parental or controltreated MDA-MB-231 cells (27). These ﬁndings were conﬁrmed
by qRT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S4B and S5A). Flow cytometry analyses have also shown that cell surface expression of
CXCR4 was lower in cells silenced for ROR1 (Supplementary
Fig. S5B).
We examined for EMT-associated markers in cells transfected with CTRL-shRNA or ROR1-shRNA. Suppressing ROR1
with either ROR1-siRNA or ROR1-shRNA1/2 in either MDAMB-231, HS-578T, or BT549 attenuated expression of mRNA
and proteins associated with EMT (e.g., vimentin, SNAIL-1/2,

Targeting ROR1 Inhibits Breast Cancer Metastasis

Figure 1. High-level expression of ROR1 in breast cancer is associated with shorter metastasis-free survival and EMT gene signature. A, graph was derived
from published data available through the PubMed GEO database (GSE2603, GSE5327, GSE2034, and GSE12276). Kaplan–Meier curves depict the
prognostic impact of ROR1 expression on overall metastasis-free survival. For each analysis, 582 cases were segregated into tertiles with group
designated ROR1H representing the one-third of the patients who had tumors with the highest levels of ROR1 mRNA and the group designated ROR1L
representing the one-third of patients who had cancers with the lowest levels of ROR1 mRNA. The one-third of patients who had tumors with
intermediate expression of ROR1 mRNA was designated as ROR1M. Metastasis-free survival was determined by Kaplan–Meier analyses, and statistical
differences were determined by log-rank test. The number of patients in each category, the total metastatic events, and the corresponding P values (c2 test) are
shown in the embedded tables. B, heatmap showing the expression of ROR1 (top), EMT-related genes in primary breast cancer cells isolated from

and ZEB1). Conversely, suppressing ROR1 increased expression of epithelial cytokeratins (e.g., CK-19). Although we did
not observe signiﬁcant changes in the TJP1 mRNA encoding
ZO-1 in any of the 3 cell lines examined, cells silenced for ROR1
expressed higher levels of this tight junction protein, suggesting that ZO-1 might be under posttranscriptional control (Fig.
1C and D and Supplementary Fig. S6). Finally, transfection of
ROR1-negative MCF7 cells to express ROR1 decreased expression of epithelial proteins (e.g., E-cadherin and CK19) and
increased expression of EMT transcriptional factors such as
SNAIL1/2 (Fig. 1E).
MDA-MB-231, HS-578T, or BT549 cells typically exhibited
the stellate morphology of mesenchymal cells in vitro (9).
However, cells silenced for ROR1 assumed the more spherical morphology of epithelial cells (Fig. 2A). Furthermore,

www.aacrjournals.org

suppressing ROR1 induced increased expression of E-cadherin and CK-19, but reduced expression of vimentin in
MDA-MG-231 (Fig. 2B). Similar results were also observed
for HS-578T or BT549 cells. On the other hand, compared
with untreated cells or cells transfected with a control
vector, ROR1-negative MCF7 cells developed a morphologic
resemblance to mesenchymal cells and had decreased
expression of epithelial markers (e.g., CK19 and E-cadherin),
and increased expression of mesenchymal markers, such as
vimentin, when transfected to express ROR1 (Supplementary
Fig. S2C and S2D). Cells silenced for ROR1 with either ROR1shRNA1 or ROR1-shRNA2 had a reduced capacity for migration/invasion, and for chemotaxis toward CXCL12, than cells
treated with CTRL-shRNA (Fig. 2E and F, and Supplementary
Fig. S5C).

growth rates, the median number of days from cell injection
to surgical removal of the primary tumors was signiﬁcantly greater for mice injected with cells silenced for ROR1
(40  2.5 days) than for mice that received equal numbers

with ROR1-silenced cells (Fig. 3J–L).
Silencing ROR1 inhibits experimental lung and bone
metastasis
We administered the ROR1-shRNA- or CTRL-shRNA–transfected MDA-MB-231 to 6-week-old RAG/g c/ mice via
intravenous (5  105 cells) or intracardiac (1  105 cells)
injection to evaluate for differences in metastatic potential of
cells injected into either the venous or arterial blood. All
animals that received CTRL-shRNA–transfected cells via the
lateral tail vein died within 32 days due to lung metastasis,
whereas mice that received ROR1-silenced cells survived signiﬁcantly longer (Fig. 4A). Animals injected with CTRLshRNA–transfected cells had 19-fold or 60-fold greater bioluminescence in the lungs at day 21 or day 28, respectively, than
mice injected with cells silenced for ROR1 (Fig. 4B). We also
sacriﬁced animals in another experiment at various times to
examine the lungs for metastatic disease. Although nascent
metastatic foci were readily detected at 3 days after injection of
CTRL-shRNA–transfected cells, few, if any, metastatic foci
could be detected in the lungs of animals injected with
ROR1-silenced cells, even at later time points (Fig. 4C–E).
Moreover, lungs extirpated from mice injected with CTRLshRNA–transfected cells had signiﬁcantly greater ex vivo bio-

luminescence and median weight (3-fold and 6-fold on days 21
and 28, respectively) than lungs of mice injected with ROR1silenced cells (Fig. 4F and G, data not shown). The metastatic
foci that developed in animals injected with CTRL-shRNA–
transfected cells also expressed higher levels of phospho-AKT
and phospho-CREB and had higher proportions of proliferating cells than the few metastatic foci that we detected in mice
injected with ROR1-silenced cells, which instead expressed
higher levels of CK-19 and lower levels of vimentin (Supplementary Fig. S8).
We also examined for metastatic disease following injection of 1  105 cells into the left cardiac ventricle. All mice
that received CTRL-shRNA–transfected cells died within 30
days of this injection, whereas animals injected with ROR1silenced cells survived signiﬁcantly longer (Fig. 4H). Mice
injected with CTRL-shRNA–transfected cells developed substantial femoral/pelvic area bioluminescence, which was not
detected in mice injected with tumor cells silenced for ROR1
(Fig. 4I and J). We sacriﬁced animals on day 21 and found that
the isolated femoral/pelvic bones of mice injected with CTRLshRNA–transfected cells had high bioluminescence (Fig. 4K)
due to extensive marrow metastasis (Fig. 4L), which was not
apparent in mice injected with cells silenced for ROR1.

found that each of these cell lines still expressed ROR1 (Supplementary Fig. S9A). We suppressed ROR1 in each with ROR1shRNA (Supplementary Fig. S9B and S9C), allowing us to

had a signiﬁcantly lower median increase in lung bioluminescence and signiﬁcantly longer median survival than did mice

21 days after the injection of ROR1-silenced LM2-4175 had
signiﬁcantly lower median weight, ex vivo bioluminescence,
and fewer and smaller metastatic foci than mice injected with

S9F–S9H). Similarly, mice injected with BoM-1833 silenced for
ROR1 had signiﬁcantly lower increases in skeletal bioluminescence than did mice injected with equal numbers of CTRLshRNA–transfected BoM-1833 (Supplementary Fig. S9I and
S9J). Moreover, necropsy of animals sacriﬁced 21 days after
intracardiac injection revealed few, if any, detectable metastatic foci in the bone or liver. This was in marked contrast to
the extensive metastatic disease detected at each of these sites
in animals injected with CTRL-shRNA–transfected BoM-1833
(Supplementary Fig. S9J and S9K).
An anti-ROR1 antibody inhibits cancer metastasis
We generated monoclonal antibodies (mAb) speciﬁc for the
extracellular domain of ROR1 and selected one (D10), which
could induce rapid downmodulation of surface ROR1 at 37 C
(Fig. 5A). Treatment of MDA-MB-231 with D10 caused ROR1
internalization, as assessed via confocal microscopy (Fig. 5B).
This resulted in signiﬁcant reduction of ROR1, as assessed via
ﬂow cytometry using a different mAb speciﬁc for a distinct,
non–cross-blocking epitope of ROR1 (Fig. 5C). Treatment of
MDA-MB-231 with D10 also reduced expression of cytoplasmic
vimentin (Fig. 5D), which was bound to ROR1 in coimmunoprecipitation studies (Fig. 5E). Treatment with D10 also signiﬁcantly inhibited the migration and invasion capacity of
MDA-MB-231 in vitro (Fig. 5F and G). D10 also could inhibit the
migration/invasion capacity of other ROR1þ cancer cell-lines
(e.g., HS-578T and BT549; Supplementary Fig. S10).
We assessed whether D10 could inhibit invasion and metastasis of MDA-MB-231 injected into the tail vein of RAG/g c/
mice. Following injection of 5  105 cells, the mice were given
an intravenous injection of control IgG or D10 at 5 mg/kg and
then sacriﬁced 3 days later. The ex vivo bioluminescence of the
lungs from animals given D10 was signiﬁcantly lower than that
of animals treated with control IgG (Fig. 5H). Moreover, the
lungs of animals that received control IgG had multiple met-

astatic foci, which were not detectable in mice treated with
D10. In another experiment, each mouse received an intravenous injection of 5  105 MDA-MB-231 and then given 3 weekly
intravenous injections of control IgG or D10 at 5 mg/kg. Mice
treated with D10 developed signiﬁcantly less pulmonary bioluminescence than mice given control IgG (Fig. 5I and J). When
sacriﬁced at day 35, the lungs of D10-treated mice had significantly lower median weight (Fig. 5K) and fewer metastatic foci
(Fig. 5L) than lungs of control-treated animals. Collectively,
these data indicate that D10 can inhibit metastasis in immunodeﬁcient mice.

Discussion
Here, we show that ROR1 associates with EMT and cancer
metastasis. Patients with breast cancers that had high-level
expression of ROR1 had shorter metastasis-free survival than
patients with cancers that had intermediate-to-negligible
ROR1. Moreover, expression of ROR1 was peculiar to basaltype cell lines that had high metastatic potential. Silencing
ROR1 reduced the expression of proteins implicated in
cancer metastasis, such as SNAIL-1/2, ZEB1, CXCR4, and
vimentin, but increased the expression of epithelial and tight
junction proteins, such as CK-19 and ZO-1, indicating that
ROR1 was necessary for maintaining the mesenchymal
phenotype. Silencing ROR1 markedly impaired the capacity
of cancer cells to migrate into tissues and establish tumor
foci at distant sites, underscoring the importance of ROR1 in
cancer metastasis. Importantly, perturbing the cell surface
expression of ROR1 with an anti-ROR1 mAb could disrupt
the capacity of such cells to migrate or form metastatic foci,
indicating that targeting ROR1 may mitigate the risk for
cancer metastasis.
In prior studies, we observed that silencing ROR1 in MDAMB-231 lowered the levels of p-AKT and p-CREB, which was
associated with decreased rates of cell proliferation (21).
However, our studies presented here indicate that this could
not fully account for the reduced metastatic potential of ROR1silenced MDA-MB-231 cells to undergo metastasis. First, MDAMB-231 cells silenced for ROR1 had a reduced capacity to
invade the lung within 24 to 72 hours (Fig. 4B and C and
Supplementary Figs. S7A and S9D) after intravenous administration, when differences in the numbers of viable cells
between ROR1-silenced versus control-treated cells were not
apparent. Second, in the orthotopic model, we allowed for the
primary tumor to grow to the same size in mice injected with
either control-treated or ROR1-silenced cells before examining
for metastatic foci (Fig. 3B). As such, the mice challenged with
ROR1-silenced MDA-MB-231 cells had a signiﬁcantly longer
latency period following primary tumor engraftment before
examining for metastases. Third, we compared the growth of
primary tumors in orthotopic mammary fat pads versus that of

(ROR1) were used for immunoblot analyses probed with antibodies speciﬁc for vimentin (top) or ROR1 (bottom). F, histograms provide the number of migrated
MDA-MB-231 cells that were pretreated for 1 hour with D10 or control IgG. G, representative photomicrographs of migration (left) or invasion (right) of
MDA-MB-231 following treatment with control IgG or D10. H, left, histograms depicting the in vivo lung photon ﬂux. Right, representative H&E-stained sections

metastatic disease to the lung using different inoculation cell
doses and noted signiﬁcant differences between mice injected
with control versus ROR1-silenced MDA-MB-231 in the growth
of metastatic disease in the lung at 21 days, when there was not
a signiﬁcant difference between the growth of the primary
tumors that formed at the site of injection (Supplementary Fig.
S7). Finally, treatment with D10 signiﬁcantly reduced the
numbers of metastatic lesions observed in mice injected with
MDA-MB-231 cells, even though this antibody had little or
no effect on the rate of cell proliferation in vitro. Collectively,
these data argue that ROR1 inﬂuences the rate of tumor cell
metastasis.
Prior studies have shown that silencing ROR1 in MDAMB-231 resulted in decreased levels of phosphorylation at
Ser-473 (phospho-AKT; 27). Consistent with this, we noted
that the metastatic foci formed by MDA-MB-231 expressed
high levels of phospho-AKT, which was not found in the few
metastatic foci of mice injected with MDA-MB-231 cells
silenced for ROR1. Activation of AKT may induce expression
of SNAI1, SNAI2, and ZEB1, which in turn can promote
expression of proteins that characterize EMT (31–35). Here,
we provide evidence that expression of these key EMT
regulators in breast cancer cell lines is dependent upon
expression of ROR1, which we and others found could
promote activation of p-AKT in primary cancers and cancer
cell lines (15, 21, 27).
The reduced metastatic potential of cells silenced for ROR1
may also be attributed in part to their reduced expression of
chemokine receptors such as CXCR4. Expression of CXCR4
allows cancer cells to seed distant organ that have relatively
high levels of CXCL12, the ligand for CXCR4 (36, 37). Moreover,
inhibition of the CXCL12–CXCR4 axis can partially inhibit the
in vivo metastasis of MDA-MB–231 to the lung or the marrow
(36), sites with relatively high-level expression of CXCL12 (6).
We observed that silencing ROR1 resulted in reduced expression of CXCR4 and inhibited capacity of these cells to migrate
toward CXCL12 in vitro. This, together with the other changes
noted in expression of EMT-related proteins, might account for
the reduced potential for metastatic spread of MDA-MB-231
cells silenced for ROR1.
The role played by ROR1 in cancer metastases might be
conscripted from its physiologic role in embryogenesis. EMT is
required for normal development (7, 10); during early embryogenesis, epithelial cells undergo this transition, allowing them
to lose cell–cell contact and cell polarity, acquire gene expression signatures of mesenchymal cells, and develop the
increased motility and invasiveness required to seed developing organs (38). At such stages of embryogenesis, ROR1 is
expressed by NPCs, which are migrating neural crest cells with
mesenchymal properties in the neocortex (19). Recent
studies found silencing ROR1 in NPCs decreased production
of neurons in long-term culture as ROR1 signaling apparently
was required to prevent premature differentiation of NPCs
(20). Similarly, ROR1 might function in neoplasia to regulate
the proliferative, invasive, and mesenchymal properties of
CSCs.
In any case, the results of this study suggest that ROR1 is a
critical regulator of the invasive properties of cancer cells

3658

that are required for metastasis. Loss of ROR1 seems to
reverse EMT, allowing the cancer cells to acquire expression
of epithelial cytokeratins and tight junction proteins that
may tether the cell to a local microenvironment. Such
changes are associated with a diminished capacity for cell
migration and invasiveness, which also is observed for
cancer cells treated with the anti-ROR1 mAb D10. D10 can
cause cell surface downmodulation and internalization of
ROR1, which seems to be associated with the cytoplasmic
cytoskeletal protein vimentin. In this regard, D10 may function like a ligand for ROR1, such as Wnt5a, which we found
in prior studies, could bind ROR1 to effect noncanonical Wnt
signaling (22). Surface expression of Wnt5a and/or other
ligands by cells within the microenvironment might serve to
downmodulate ROR1 to effect reversal of EMT. High-level
expression of ROR1 ligands thus might mitigate the risk of
metastasis, possibly accounting for the paradoxical association of high-level expression of Wnt5a with a more favorable prognosis for some cancers (39–45). However, recent
studies have found that recombinant Wnt5a actually
increases MDA-MB-231 cell motility (46). This is in direct
contrast to what we observe following treatment of such
cells with the anti-ROR1 mAb D10. Conceivably, D10 might
cause perturbations and/or turnover in ROR1, which seems
to be required to maintain the functions associated with
EMT. This may be due to the distinct way D10 binds to
ROR1 and/or the ability of this bivalent antibody to effect
ROR1 cross-linking, which may not be induced by Wnt5a
unless it is expressed on the plasma membrane of cells
within the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, Wnt5a
might engage receptors other than ROR1 that could inﬂuence the outcome of Wnt5a–tumor interactions (47–49); this
is in contrast to D10, which is speciﬁc for ROR1.
In summary, we found that expression of ROR1 is required to
maintain EMT and that targeting ROR1 can inhibit cancer
metastasis. Because normal postpartum tissues generally do
not express this oncoembryonic antigen, therapeutic targeting
of ROR1 may offer a highly selective approach to mitigating the
risk of metastatic disease.
