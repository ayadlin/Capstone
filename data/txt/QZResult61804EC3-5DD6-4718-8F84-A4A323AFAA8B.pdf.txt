ABSTRACT
Platinum-based DNA-damaging chemotherapy is standard-of-care for most
patients with lung cancer but outcomes remain poor. This has been attributed, in
part, to the highly effective repair network known as the DNA-damage response
(DDR). ATR kinase is a critical regulator of this pathway, and its inhibition has been
shown to sensitize some cancer, but not normal, cells in vitro to DNA damaging
agents. However, there are limited in vivo proof-of-concept data for ATR inhibition. To
address this we profiled VX-970, the first clinical ATR inhibitor, in a series of in vitro
and in vivo lung cancer models and compared it with an inhibitor of the downstream
kinase Chk1. VX-970 markedly sensitized a large proportion of a lung cancer cell
line and primary tumor panel in vitro to multiple DNA damaging drugs with clear
differences to Chk1 inhibition observed. In vivo VX-970 blocked ATR activity in tumors
and dramatically enhanced the efficacy of cisplatin across a panel of patient derived
primary lung xenografts. The combination led to complete tumor growth inhibition
in three cisplatin-insensitive models and durable tumor regression in a cisplatinsensitive model. These data provide a strong rationale for the clinical evaluation of
VX-970 in lung cancer patients.

INTRODUCTION

cell survival pathways and DNA repair. The DDR is
regulated by two homologous protein kinases, ataxia
telangiectasia mutated (ATM), and ATM and Rad3related (ATR)[6, 7]. ATM is activated by double strand
breaks at all stages of the cell cycle. ATR, on the other
hand, is recruited to tracts of single stranded DNA coated
with replication protein A (RPA), a characteristic of stalled
replication forks (replication stress) and resected double
strand breaks that arise during the S and G2 phases of the
cell cycle. While these two kinases respond to different
DNA damage structures, they exhibit significant functional
and signaling overlap. In keeping with this, inhibition of
ATR can lead to activation of ATM and a compensatory
DDR[8].

DNA damaging agents such as cisplatin, etoposide,
gemcitabine and ionizing radiation (IR) remain the
cornerstone of cancer treatment, yet for most patients they
provide only modest benefit. This has been attributed, in
part, to the presence of a highly effective DNA damage
surveillance and repair network[1-4]. A complex signaling
pathway known as the DNA damage response (DDR)
constitutes an important component of this network [5].
It is activated by some of the most lethal forms of DNA
damage including double strand breaks and replicative
stress, which arises when DNA replication forks stall.
Upon activation, the DDR triggers cell cycle checkpoints,

Despite the importance of the DDR for cell survival
following DNA damage, defects in this repair pathway are
common in cancer. For example, loss of ATM signaling
capacity is frequently observed, either through loss of
expression of ATM itself, or through defects in upstream
regulators and downstream effectors such as p53[9-12].
It is believed that such defects in the DDR facilitate the
emergence and proliferation of genetically unstable cancer
cells[13]. Although defects in ATM signaling appear
to confer a growth advantage, they cause a reliance on
remaining DDR components, such as ATR, and thus
provide an ‘Achilles’ heel’ that could be targeted by new
drugs. Consistent with this hypothesis we, and others,
have shown that biological depletion or inhibition of ATR
dramatically sensitizes cell lines lacking ATM or p53
function to DNA damaging drug mediated apoptotic cell
death[8, 14-19]. In addition, mechanisms that increase
replicative stress in cancer cells also appear to drive a
reliance on the DDR, and ATR specifically, for survival.
These include expression of common oncogenes such as
Myc and Ras, and an hypoxic microenvironment[20-24].
Clinical evidence that DNA repair proficiency can
influence response to DNA damaging therapy is emerging.
For example, ovarian cancer patients harboring loss-offunction of the BRCA1/2 homologous recombination
repair (HRR) proteins, respond better to platinum-based
therapy than those patients with wild-type BRCA[4, 25,
26]. Furthermore, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
patients with compromised ERCC1 function (a protein
involved in various DNA repair pathways including
HRR) have similarly improved responses to cisplatinbased therapy[2]. Taken together these observations have
fueled interest in identifying drug candidates that target
components of the DDR such as ATM, ATR, DNA-PK
and the checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2. Of these,
only inhibitors of Chk1/2, and very recently of ATR, have
entered clinical studies.
Lung cancer is the second most common cancer
and a leading cause of cancer mortality. In the US alone
it is estimated that over 200 000 new cases of lung
cancer are diagnosed each year[27] [28]. Small cell lung
cancer accounts for 10-15% of the overall lung cancer
population with first line standard-of-care a doublet of a
platinum drug (cisplatin or carboplatin) and etoposide.
Although many patients initially respond to such
treatment, almost all relapse[29]. NSCLC accounts for
about 85% of the overall incidence of lung cancer[27].
The discovery of ‘targeted’ drugs such as erlotinib, that
blocks aberrant EGFR signaling in patients with mutant
EGFR, and crizotinib that blocks ALK signaling in
patients expressing the EML4-ALK driver fusion protein,
has led to improvements in NSCLC therapy for a small
population of patients. However, the majority of patients
are not candidates for treatment with such drugs[30] and
for these patients standard-of-care remains platinumbased chemotherapy and survival is typically less than
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

12 months [28]. Clearly, there remains a high need for
new therapies. Common characteristics of lung cancer,
particularly NSCLC, are the widespread expression of
oncogenes that drive replication stress (e.g. K-ras) and
high frequency of defects in the ATM-p53 signaling
pathway. For example, in one comprehensive analysis
>80% of squamous cell NSCLC carried a mutation in the
TP53 gene, which is believed in many cases to lead to p53
loss-of-function[31]. This combination of high replication
stress and defective ATM signaling may provide a strong
reliance on ATR for survival following DNA damage.
Consequently, the combination of an ATR inhibitor with
agents such as cisplatin could be an attractive therapeutic
option for lung cancer and for other indications that have
a reliance on ATR for survival following treatment with
DNA damaging therapy.
VX-970 (previously referred to as VE-822[18])
was the first potent and highly selective inhibitor of ATR
to enter clinical studies (EUDRACT: 2012-003126250, ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02157792). In this report,
extensive in vitro and in vivo evidence is provided to
support the hypothesis that ATR inhibition can improve
lung cancer patient responses to DNA damaging agents.
Specifically, VX-970 markedly sensitized a large
proportion of NSCLC with lung cell lines, but not normal
cells, to multiple DNA damaging drugs. Consistent
with prior reports, matched cell lines differing only in
p53 status confirmed that p53 loss of function, through
deletion, influences cell sensitivity to ATR inhibition. In
addition, VX-970 at well-tolerated doses, was shown to
dramatically improve responses to cisplatin across a panel
of primary patient-derived xenograft models. Finally, cell
responses to VX-970 were compared with an inhibitor
of the ATR substrate, Chk1. This highlighted significant
differences between the two approaches, which may have
important consequences to how these agents can be most
effectively used in the clinic.

RESULTS
VX-970

phosphorylation of Chk1 and increases
levels of DNA damage markers in vitro
VX-970 (also referred to as VE-822[18], Figure 1A)
is a highly potent and selective, ATP competitive, inhibitor
of ATR[18]. We previously reported that VX-970 inhibits
ATR in biochemical assays with a Ki <200pM and that it
has excellent selectivity over a panel of other kinases. Most
notably VX-970 has >100-fold selectivity for ATR over
the related phosphatidylinositol 3’ kinase-related kinases
(PIKK) including ATM and DNA-PK, both of which are
involved in alternative DNA repair processes. We also
showed that ATR potency and selectivity is retained in

cells; VX-970 blocks ATR driven phosphorylation of
H2AX with an IC50 of 19nM, compared with an IC50 of
2.6µM and 18µM for inhibition of ATM and DNA-PK
mediated signaling respectively [18].
To demonstrate the impact of VX-970 on cisplatininduced ATR signaling and DNA repair, H2009 lung
cancer cells were treated with VX-970 and cisplatin as
single agents or in combination (Figure 1B). ATR activity
was assessed by measuring P-Chk1 (S345) and DNA
damage accumulation by P-H2AX (S139) and P-KAP1
(S824). VX-970 treatment alone inhibited background
levels of P-Chk1 and led to mild induction of P-H2AX
and P-KAP1. Cisplatin alone resulted in elevation of
P-Chk1, P-H2AX and P-KAP1 above background. Cotreatment with VX-970 and cisplatin resulted in a VX-970
concentration-dependent suppression of cisplatin-induced
P-Chk1 and a concurrent marked increase in P-H2AX and
P-KAP1. These data are consistent with inhibition of ATR
leading to the accumulation of DNA damage.

Inhibition of ATR or its downstream substrate,
Chk1, has been shown to sensitize cancer cells to certain
DNA damaging drugs and ionizing radiation (IR). The
long-held view has been that these two proteins operate
on the same linear pathway[32]. However, a recent study
using VE-821 (an analog of VX-970) and a Chk1 inhibitor,
in a small number of ovarian cancer lines, concluded that
the sensitization profiles of these two compounds can be
different[33]. In order to get a better understanding, we
assessed the ability of VX-970 and the Chk1 inhibitor

that ATR pathway inhibitors can still sensitise ATM/p53
competent cells to DNA damaging agents[8, 14, 21, 35].
To examine the impact of p53 status on cellular response,
we first assessed VX-970 in combination with five DNA
damaging drugs on a pair of isogenic A549 cells stably
transfected with either p53 shRNA or a scrambled RNA
control vector. In all cases the combination of VX-970
with a DNA damaging drug was more effective in the
p53 knockdown line (Figure 2C). In contrast, responses
for AZD7762 were only affected by p53 function in
combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin. To investigate
the role of p53 across a heterogeneous set of cell lines
we looked at the correlation of TP53 mutational status
with cell sensitivity (defined by >3-fold IC50 shift). TP53
mutational status was used as this is readily measurable
in the clinic, in contrast to p53 function. Although no
significant correlations were observed (P>0.05), an
interesting but non-significant trend was found with the
combination of VX-970 and cisplatin (odds ratio of 6.1,
P =0.08). For all other combinations no correlation was
observed. Furthermore, no correlation was found with
response and histological background of the cell lines
(data not shown).

AZD7762[34] to sensitize a panel of 35 lung cancer cell
lines to five DNA damaging drugs: cisplatin, oxaliplatin,
gemcitabine, etoposide and SN38, the active metabolite
of irinotecan (Figure 2, Supplementary Figures 1 and 2,
Supplementary Table 1). Sensitization was determined
by measuring the maximum shifts in IC50 values (cell
viability) for the DNA damaging drug in the presence or
absence of the DDR inhibitor. The data are presented as
a heatmap (Figure 2A) and as histograms that show the
percentage of lines with >3-fold or >10-fold shifts in
IC50 (Figure 2B). VX-970 sensitized (defined by >3-fold
IC50 shift) over 40% of cell lines to all of the five drugs.
The effect of VX-970 was most evident with cisplatin
or gemcitabine co-treatment, where >75% of cell lines
were sensitized (>3-fold IC50 shift). In contrast, against
a non-cancer lung cell line (HFL1), sensitization was
only observed in combination with gemcitabine (Figure
2A). AZD7762 showed a similar profile to VX-970 in
combination with gemcitabine, SN38 and etoposide.
However, in combination with platinating drugs,
AZD7762 was far less effective than VX-970 (<50% cells
sensitized to cisplatin and <10% sensitized to oxaliplatin).
When the data were analyzed to identify highly responsive
lines (defined by >10-fold IC50 shift), we found that VX970 hypersensitized >40% of cell lines to cisplatin. In
contrast AZD7762 hypersensitized only 10% of cell lines
to cisplatin, but was more effective in combination with
gemcitabine than VX-970 (40% of lines hypersensitized
to AZD7762 vs 14% with VX-970). These data show
that ATR and Chk1 inhibitors have different sensitization
profiles, with VX-970, the ATR inhibitor, most effective
in combination with platinating agents and AZD7762,
the Chk1 inhibitor, most effective in combination with
gemcitabine.
Using isogenically matched cell pairs, a number
of studies have demonstrated that disruption of ATM/
p53 function promotes sensitivity to inhibition of the
ATR pathway. This has been attributed to a synthetic
lethal relationship between the ATR and ATM signaling
pathways[8, 14-17, 19]. However, it has also been shown

VX-970 synergizes with cisplatin in primary
human lung tumor cells in vitro
To further explore the clinical potential of VX970, we assessed it in combination with cisplatin in
vitro against seven primary human NSCLC tumors from
a range of histopathological subtypes (Supplementary
Table 3). Responses were determined by CellTiter-Glo as
a measure of cell viability and synergy was assessed using
a statistical Bliss analysis (Figure 3) or by determining
the impact of VX-970 on the IC50 for cisplatin (Table 1).
The seven tumors showed varying responses to cisplatin
monotherapy with IC50 values over the range 3.0 µM –

29.1 µM. Marked synergy (log volume >20) was observed
between VX-970 and cisplatin for four of the seven
tumors, and for three of these the IC50 for cisplatin was
reduced by >3-fold on addition of VX-970. Interestingly,
tumors with poor response to cisplatin monotherapy were
the tumors that demonstrated the greatest synergy with
VX-970. There was no apparent relationship between
TP53 status and response. Consistent with observations
on the H2009 cell line, treatment of these primary tumors
with VX-970 led to a concentration-dependent inhibition
of cisplatin-induced P-Chk1 and elevation of P-H2AX and
P-KAP1 (Supplementary Figure 3).

damage was measured by P-H2AX western blot, 48 hours
after treatment (Figure 5A, Supplementary Figure 5).
Treatment with VX-970 led to a significant inhibition of
cisplatin-induced P-Chk1 and elevation of P-H2AX (P ≤
0.05). In a separate study, tumor concentrations of VX970 were determined from a single oral dose of 60 mg/kg.
Correcting for protein binding, the maximum free–drug
tumor concentration (Cmax) of VX-970 was 720nM, 4
hours after dosing. During the 48-hour period following
administration of VX-970, free-drug tumor concentrations
were maintained at over 230nM. These concentrations are
substantially in excess of the cell IC50 for inhibition of
ATR (19nM) but below the cell IC50 for inhibition of ATM
or DNA-PK (2.6µM and 18µM respectively). Together
the results indicate that at doses used in this study (60mg/
kg), VX-970 blocks ATR (but not ATM or DNA-PK)
activity in tumors, leading to disruption of DNA repair
and accumulation of cisplatin-mediated DNA damage.

VX-970 enhances the efficacy of cisplatin in
patient-derived lung tumor xenografts
We next tested the efficacy of VX-970 in
combination with cisplatin in SCID mice implanted with
each of the seven primary lung tumors (Supplementary
Table 3). Oral doses of VX-970 at 30 or 60 mg/kg for four
consecutive days each week, alone or in combination with
weekly IP doses of cisplatin at 3 mg/kg were well tolerated
with a non-statistically significant decrease in body weight
in some of the combination groups immediately following
initiation of treatment (Supplementary Table 4). Body
weight was gained between treatment cycles (a typical
body weight profile is provided in Supplementary Figure 4
for tumor OD35982). VX-970 alone showed no significant
single agent effect in any of the seven models. Cisplatin,
on the other hand, gave a range of responses: three tumors
were sensitive to cisplatin monotherapy (tumor growth
inhibition >70%; OD26749, OD29498, BDG121410),
one tumor was weakly sensitive (tumor growth inhibition
50-70%; OD33966), and three were resistant to cisplatin
(tumor growth inhibition <20%; OD35982, OD26131,
OD29607), Figure 4). Addition of VX-970 led to a
statistically significant enhancement of cisplatin efficacy
in six of the seven models examined (P ≤ 0.05; for
BDG121410 P=0.1). Notably, the combination led to
complete tumor growth inhibition in the three-cisplatin
insensitive models and complete tumor regression in one
cisplatin sensitive model (OD26749 model, Figure 4A).
We selected the OD26749 model to further characterize
the response of primary lung xenograft tumors to VX-970
alone and in combination with cisplatin.

13 days. Untreated tumors showed a pronounced uptake
of 18FLT, with the standardized uptake value (SUV)
greatly exceeding that seen in surrounding normal tissues
(Figure 5B and C). Six days following treatment with
cisplatin alone, the tumor SUV had dropped by nearly
half compared to vehicle control (P <0.01, Figure 5B
and C). In contrast, administration with VX-970 alone at
the doses used in this study had no effect on tumor SUV.
Co-administration with VX-970 and cisplatin caused a
mean drop in SUV that was greater than with cisplatin
treatment alone (P<0.05 at day 10; Figure 5C). Tumor
size, as measured by CT (Figure 5D), correlated with
probe uptake. Co-administration of VX-970 with cisplatin
led to significantly greater inhibition of tumor growth than
was observed with cisplatin or VX-970 alone, (P <0.01 at
Day 10). To assess whether 18FLT uptake could be used
as a very early marker for tumor response, we examined
tracer uptake during the 42 hours following initiation
of treatment (Figure 5E). By 24 hours after treatment,
suppression of 18FLT uptake in the combination treated
mice was significantly greater than in mice treated with
cisplatin alone (38 % vs. 24 % respectively, P <0.05) and
this difference was even more apparent by 42 hours (47
% vs. 23 %, P = 0.01). These data support the potential
for 18FLT uptake as a prognostic biomarker of response to
VX-970 in combination with DNA damaging drugs such
as cisplatin.

with many DNA damaging anti-cancer drugs. Therefore
much effort has been expended on the discovery and
development of inhibitors of the DDR that could be used
to enhance the efficacy of DNA damaging agents[37,
38]. Until recently, Chk1-targeted agents have been the
only inhibitors of DDR signaling to progress into the
clinic. However, more recently, two ATR-targeted drug
candidates have been reported (VX-970, also referred to
as VE-822[18], and AZD6738). In previous reports we
have shown that VX-970 is a highly potent inhibitor of
ATR in biochemical (ATR Ki <0.2nM) and cell based
assays (ATR IC50 19nM) with excellent selectivity over
the related kinases ATM and DNA-PK and a panel of
unrelated kinases[18]. This study describes the impact of
inhibiting ATR by VX-970 on cell and tumor responses to
DNA damaging drugs.
VX-970 blocks cisplatin induced P-Chk1 (S345) and
elevates the levels of two DNA damage markers (P-H2AX
at S139 and P-KAP1 at S824) in a concentrationdependent manner in cancer cell lines and primary human
tumors. These changes are evident with concentrations
of VX-970 as low as 100nM, significantly below the
concentrations required to impact the activity of the other
DNA repair kinases ATM and DNA-PK (IC50 values of
2.6µM and 18µM respectively[18]). This is consistent
with the notion that inhibition of ATR impairs repair of
DNA lesions leading to accumulation of damage[6, 39].
Phosphorylation of Chk1, H2AX and KAP1 could serve
as clinical pharmacodynamic markers for ATR-targeted
drug-candidates. However, in a recent study [33], VE821 (a close analog of VX-970) failed to impact P-Chk1
(Ser-345) in ovarian cancer cell lines despite causing an
elevation of P-H2AX. Therefore, we cannot discount the
possibility that other kinases are able to phosphorylate
Chk1 at Ser345 in certain contexts. To address this
possibility, a comprehensive analysis of ATR-mediated
phosphorylation of Chk1, across different cell types and
during extended time courses, is warranted.
Several studies have used small numbers of cell
lines to assess the potential for inhibition of the DDR to
sensitize cancer cells to various DNA damaging agents.
From these studies a couple of interesting observations
emerged. First, despite ATR and Chk1 acting on the same
signaling cascade[32], inhibition of these individual
proteins can have quite different consequences [33, 40].
Second, disruption of p53 function can influence cellular
response to inhibition of the DDR[8, 14-17, 19, 41-43].
This has been attributed to a synthetic lethal relationship
between ATR and the ATM-p53 signaling pathway[8]. We
sought to elaborate on these two observations by assessing
the effects of the ATR inhibitor, VX-970, and the Chk1
inhibitor, AZD7762, on an extensive panel of lung cancer
cell lines in combination with five DNA damaging drugs
from various mechanistic classes. VX-970 sensitized

It sensitized cells to cisplatin most effectively with

VX-970 and cisplatin combinations cause
significant regression and delayed tumor regrowth
in a human primary tumor xenograft model
The durability of response to VX-970 with cisplatin
was assessed in mice bearing OD26749 tumors. Mice
were treated for two weeks with VX-970 daily at 60 mg/kg
PO for four consecutive days each week and with cisplatin
at 3 mg/kg IP once weekly. The combination induced
profound and near complete tumor regression (Figure 5F)
whereas cisplatin treatment alone only induced modest
tumor growth inhibition. Upon cessation of treatment with
the combination of VX-970 and cisplatin, tumor growth
remained suppressed for three weeks before tumors started
to grow back. The time-to-tumor-doubling from the start
of the study (TTD) for the combination was 45 days,
significantly longer than for cisplatin alone (25 days P
<0.05).

DISCUSSION
Double strand DNA breaks and replicative stress
can lead to loss of genomic integrity and cell death.
Consequently, cells have evolved a comprehensive
surveillance and repair mechanism termed the DDR[5].
Growing evidence suggests that an effective DDR is
critical for cancer cell survival following treatment

over 80% of lines responding. Of these, half exhibited
greater than 10-fold increases in sensitivity to the DNA
damaging agent. In addition, in a small study VX-970
was shown to combine very effectively with carboplatin
in two lung cancer cell lines (>10-fold shift in carboplatin
IC50, data not shown). The remarkable response to
cisplatin is consistent with recent data implicating ATR
in the activation of the Fanconi Anaemia DNA crosslink
repair pathway, defects in which are characterized by
hypersensitivity to interstrand crosslinking agents[44-46].
Taken with its established roles in the DDR, this
may explain why inhibition of ATR is so effective in
combination with cisplatin. The combination of VX-970
with oxaliplatin, another platinum based cross-linking
drug, was however generally less effective than with
cisplatin. These data suggest that subtle differences in
the structure of the cross-link lesion may lead to different
damage response pathways being activated.
A comparison of the overall profiles for AZD7762
and VX-970 highlights some interesting differences.
Although AZD7762 sensitized some cancer cells to
cisplatin, it was considerably less effective than VX-970.
This decreased cell sensitivity to AZD7762 compared
with VX-970 extended to combinations with oxaliplatin.
On the other hand, although VX-970 was effective in
combination with gemcitabine in most cells, AZD7762
appeared more effective. This was most evident from the
higher proportion of cell lines that were hypersensitized
(>10-fold shifts in gemcitabine IC50) to gemcitabine by
AZD7762 vs VX-970. Taken together, these findings
support ATR-dependent but Chk-independent survival
responses to certain DNA cross-linking agents. In
addition, our data indicate that AZD7762 may be a more
effective mechanism to sensitize cells to gemcitabine
than a selective ATR inhibitor like VX-970. This may
be attributable to the fact that AZD7762 also has Chk2
inhibitory activity[34]. Clearly, more work is required to
fully elucidate the impact of different replication stress
structures on DDR signaling. To address the role of p53
in determining cell fate following co-administration
with inhibitors of the DDR and DNA damaging drugs,
we studied the impact of p53 knockdown using an
isogenically controlled cell pair and also analyzed the
full cell panel for statistical correlations between cell
response and TP53 status (since TP53 status can be
readily assessed in the clinic in contrast to p53 function).
Consistent with previous reports using isogeneic cell
systems[8, 14-17, 19], we showed that p53 loss increased
cell sensitivity to ATR inhibition in combination with all
five DNA damaging drugs. However, in the context of an
extensive and heterogeneous cell panel, using TP53 status,
the picture became less clear. Only for the combination
of VX-970 and cisplatin was a relationship observed
between response and TP53 status, however this did not
reach statistical significance (P =0.08). Furthermore,
when VX-970 was tested in combination with cisplatin in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

a panel of seven primary lung tumors, there was no clear
relationship between cell response to VX-970 and TP53
status. A number of hypotheses can be provided to explain
the differences between isogenic cell responses and the
large cell panel data. Firstly, not all TP53 mutations lead
to loss of p53 function. Conversely some TP53 wild
type cells may be sensitive to ATR inhibition if there are
defects elsewhere in the ATM-p53 pathway. This situation
has been reported with the HCT116 colorectal cancer
cell line that is highly sensitive to ATR inhibitors despite
being wild type for TP53. In this case, defects in both
ATM expression and activation have been described[8].
Additionally, high background levels of replication stress
would also place a significant reliance on the ATR repair
pathway, which may be independent of ATM pathway
function. For example, it has been shown that expression
of oncogenes such as Myc, Ras or Cyclin E, which
cause disregulated DNA replication, drive high levels of
replicative stress[13]. Cells expressing such oncogenes
have been reported to be highly sensitive to ATR inhibition
or depletion, in the absence of additional DNA damaging
treatment. In all cases these cells expressed wild type
TP53[14, 20-22]. Predicting which tumors will respond
to treatment with drugs like VX-970 is clearly of great
clinical relevance and further work is warranted.
To assess the chances of success in the clinic, we
looked at VX-970 in combination with cisplatin in a panel
of seven xenograft models derived from primary human
NSCLC samples. At doses where VX-970 had no effect
as a monotherapy, it significantly improved responses to
cisplatin (P ≤0.05) in six out of the seven models. Notably,
three of the seven tumors were not responsive to cisplatin
monotherapy, however co-treatment with VX-970 caused
complete tumor growth inhibition. Additionally, in one
cisplatin sensitive model (OD26749) the combination of
VX-970 and cisplatin led to rapid, complete and durable
regression. In all in vivo studies the combination of
cisplatin and VX-970 was well tolerated. Free drug tumor
levels of VX-970 were maintained for 48 hours after
administration at concentrations well over that required
to block ATR activity in cells. However, even at Cmax,
the free drug concentrations of VX-970 were significantly
below that required to block ATM or DNA-PK activity in
cells. This, coupled with biomarker data showing blockade
of ATR activity and accumulation of DNA damage is
consistent with the anti-cancer activity of VX-970 being
driven by inhibition of ATR and subsequent impaired
DNA damage repair.
Finally, we assessed the potential for PET imaging,
using the 18FLT tracer, as an early marker of tumor
response to co-treatment with VX-970 and cisplatin.
Treatment with cisplatin alone resulted in a marked
decrease in 18FLT uptake. The addition of VX-970 to
cisplatin led to a further decrease in 18FLT uptake at nadir
and also altered the kinetics of uptake; decreased 18FLT
uptake occurred earlier and was sustained for longer in
5681

Oncotarget

the combination group than with cisplatin alone. The
increased impact on 18FLT uptake for the combination
group vs cisplatin monotherapy was reflected in improved
tumor growth inhibition. Importantly, differences in
18
FLT uptake between the combination and cisplatin
monotherapy groups were discernible before differences
in tumor size could be detected. This supports the use of
18
FLT-PET imaging as an early marker of efficacy in the
clinic.
In the studies described here, we have used a range
of translational in vitro and in vivo models to demonstrate
the potential VX-970 may have to increase the efficacy
of DNA damaging therapy in patients with lung cancer.
Our results support a proposal that inhibition of ATR will
provide a new approach to improve patient responses to
the DNA damaging agents that form the current standardof-care across many cancer indications.

and the cells were dissociated as described previously[48].
Dissociated cells were washed and resuspended in PC-1
medium (Invitrogen) and plated in ultra-low attachment
plates (Costar). Cisplatin was tested from 70 nM to 50
µM and VX-970 from 4 nM to 3 µM. Cell viability was
measured after 6 days using the CellTiter-Glo assay
(Promega). Synergy and antagonism were assessed
according to the Bliss independence model as described
previously (8).

Compounds
SN-38 (active metabolite of irinotecan), etoposide,
cisplatin and oxaliplatin were obtained from SigmaAldrich, gemcitabine from Sequoia Research Products and
AZD7762 from Thermo Fisher.

Cell Lines

Animals

COR-L23 and EBC-1 cell lines were obtained from
the European Collection of Cell Lines (ECACC) and the
Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources (JCRB),
respectively. All other cell lines were purchased from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). No additional
in-house authentication of cell lines was carried out. Cells
were cultured in DMEM high glucose (Life Technologies)
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Hyclone).

Female Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (Fox
Chase SCID, CB-17) mice weighing 17-19 g (Charles
River Laboratories) were acclimatized with access to
food and water ad libitum and handled in accordance with
IACUC regulations and guidelines.

to 100 µL of Matrigel (BD Biosciences) supplemented
with growth factors was injected SC into the site of
implantation. VX-970 was dissolved in 10% Vitamin E
d-alpha tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate
(TPGS) and administered by oral gavage at 30 mg/
kg for all primary tumor models except OD26749 and
OD26131 (60 mg/kg) in a dosing volume of 10 mL/kg.
Cisplatin (Sigma) was solubilized in injectable saline
(0.9 % sodium chloride, ThermoFisher) and administered
by intraperitoneal (IP) injection at 3 mg/kg in a dosing
volume of 10 mL/kg. Randomization was initiated when
the average tumor size was approximately 200 mm3.
Tumor bearing mice were administered with VX-970
(PO, 4 consecutive days a week; OD26749, OD26131,
OD35982, OD29607, OD29498, BDG121410 and
OD33966) alone and in combination with cisplatin (3 mg/
kg IP, q7d). Depending on the rate of tumor growth, two
(OD26749 and OD26131) or three treatment (OD35982,
OD29607, OD29498, BDG121410 and OD33966) cycles
were performed during the course of the study. For the
OD26749 recurrence study, two treatment cycles were
performed and then tumor growth was monitored until the
mean tumor volume reached 1000 mm3. Tumor volumes
and body weights were measured twice a week starting on
the first day of treatment until study termination. Tumor
volumes were calculated using the formula (length x
width2)/2. Fold difference in final mean tumor volume for
the cisplatin alone and combination treatment groups was
determined. For the OD26749 recurrence study, time-totumor doubling (TTD) was reported as the time required
for the average tumor volume to increase by 2-fold
compared with the average starting volume.

a 2D Filtered Back Projection algorithm corrected for
scatter into 128 x 128 x 159 image arrays with a 0.77 mm
pixel size and 0.796 mm slice thickness. CT images were
spatially aligned to the PET images using a predefined
fixed transformation matrix and used for attenuation
correction of the PET scans. Processing of reconstructed
images was performed using Inveon Research Workplace
(Siemens Preclinical Solutions). The mouse xenograft
tumor was defined on the CT image without the reference
to the PET overlay image. 3D regions of interest were
created from interpolated 2D regions of interest drawn
every eight slices in the axial view. Volume of the
xenograft was obtained from the CT image. PET voxel
intensity values were converted to standard uptake values
(SUV) by the usual equation: SUV = activity in region of
interest (ROI) / (injected dose / mouse body weight), after
accounting for decay of injected isotope.

Statistical Analysis
Odds ratio and P values for TP53 mutational
analyses were calculated using one-sided Fisher test.
Unpaired, two tailed t-tests on tumor volume were used to
evaluate statistical significance between treatment groups
in efficacy studies using human primary models.
