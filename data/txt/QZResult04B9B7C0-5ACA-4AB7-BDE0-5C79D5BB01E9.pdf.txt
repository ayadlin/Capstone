Abstract
The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is an important signaling axis that is perturbed in majority of cancers.
Biomarkers such as pS6RP, GLUT1, and tumor FDG uptake are being evaluated in patient stratiﬁcation for mTOR
pathway inhibitors. In the absence of a clear understanding of the underlying mechanisms in tumor signaling, the
biomarker strategy for patient stratiﬁcation is of limited use. Here, we show that no discernible correlation exists
between FDG uptake and the corresponding Ki67, GLUT1, pS6RP expression in tumor biopsies from patients with
head and neck cancer. Correlation between GLUT1 and pS6RP levels in tumors was observed but elevated pS6RP
was noticed even in the absence of concomitant AKT activation, suggesting that other downstream molecules of
PI3K/AKT and/or other pathways upstream of mTOR are active in these tumors. Using an ex vivo platform, we
identiﬁed putative responders to rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor in these tumors. However, rapamycin did not
induce antitumor effect in the majority of tumors with activated mTOR, potentially attributable to the
observation that rapamycin induces feedback activation of AKT. Accordingly, treatment of these tumors with
an AKT inhibitor and rapamycin uniformly resulted in abrogation of mTOR inhibition-induced AKT activation in
all tumors but failed to induce antitumor response in a subset. Phosphoproteomic proﬁling of tumors resistant to
dual AKT/mTOR inhibitors revealed differential activation of multiple pathways involved in proliferation and
survival. Collectively, our results suggest that, in addition to biomarker-based segregation, functional assessment
of a patient's tumor before treatment with mTOR/AKT inhibitors may be useful for patient stratiﬁcation. Cancer

Introduction
Head and neck cancer (HNC) is the most frequently occurring malignant tumor in South Asian countries. Despite signiﬁcant improvements in radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and
surgical procedures, the 5-year survival rate (40%–50%) for
this malignancy has not improved in the last few decades (1).
HNCs are highly heterogeneous, containing a large number of
genetic alterations rendering them refractory to speciﬁc targeted drugs. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is an important
nodal signaling axis that is deregulated in about 90% of solid

cancers and impacts local recurrence and survival (2, 3).
Research into mechanism of action of this protein in initiation,
progression, and resistance to therapy in cancer is still evolving
(4). mTOR associates with either raptor or rictor to form 2
fundamentally unique complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2 (3,
5). The mTOR-containing complexes have contrasting sensitivities to rapamycin (an mTOR inhibitor) as well as differential
upstream and downstream effectors (6). Despite the robust
activity in a variety of model systems, mTOR inhibitors exhibit
a more modest antitumor activity in a subset of patients (7).
Previous ﬁndings indicate that inhibition of mTORC1 (i.e.,
mTOR/raptor complex) with rapamycin or its derivatives
induces feedback activation of the AKT survival pathway in
various types of cancer cells, tumor specimens, and in patients
with HNCs after exposure to mTOR inhibitor (8, 9). Hyperactivation of AKT is associated with resistance to apoptosis,
increased cell growth, cell proliferation, and cell metabolism
(10). Studies in Drosophila (11, 12) and mammalian systems
have shown that the regulation of this feedback loop is
mediated by insulin signaling (13, 14). Besides S6K1, another
marker assessed extensively in relation to mTOR signaling in
solid cancers is glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1; refs. 15, 16).
GLUT1 has been extensively looked at in the context of
hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1a, another downstream effector of mTOR (17). Although GLUT1 expression is a common

feature in patients with HNCs, the prognostic value of this
parameter along with the [18F]-2-ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose
(FDG) uptake as assessed by positron emission tomography
(PET) has not been speciﬁcally evaluated with respect to
mTOR status in HNCs. Clinical development of mTOR inhibitors has prompted us to understand the prevalence of tumor
dependence on the mTOR axis. Our data show that while
mTOR inhibition activates AKT feedback loop in all the
tumors, sensitivity to rapamycin treatment was observed in
only a subpopulation of tumors. Further cotargeting the rapamycin-insensitive tumors with rapamycin and MK-2206 (an
allosteric inhibitor of AKT; ref. 18) did not enhance the
antitumor efﬁcacy of rapamycin in the majority of tumors,
indicating that the mTOR pathway despite aberrant activation
may not be the only critical node to target in these primary
HNC tumors. Targeted phosphoproteomic characterization of
these tumors revealed deregulation of several pathways with
known anti-apoptotic/prosurvival signaling nodes that could
explain the observed resistance.

Materials and Methods
Collection of human tumors
Fresh tumor tissues (n ¼ 22) were collected from patients
with HNCs immediately after biopsy procedure, with due
informed consent, under Institutional Review Board-approved
protocols from Mazumdar-Shaw Cancer Centre, Bangalore,
India. Patients who had previously received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy were excluded from the study.
The primary treatment-na€ve tumors evaluated as part of this
study were predominantly late stage (stage III and above) with
77% of the patients detected with nodal involvement (Supplementary Table S1). Tumors were predominantly of oral and
oropharyngeal origin (55%), whereas tumors of laryngeal
(27%) and hypopharyngeal (18%) origin were in the minority.
The majority of the patients were male (85%) and average age
at presentation was less than 65 years (77%). The tumor
samples were transported to the laboratory at 4 C in appropriate transport buffer within 30 minutes after resection for ex
vivo studies and molecular and pathologic evaluation.
Treatment and clinical examination
The patients enrolled in the study had the standard clinical
and radiologic evaluation before biopsy. During baseline visit,
PET-CT was conducted and standardized uptake value (SUV)
assessed. Tissue viability and histopathologic diagnosis were
conﬁrmed by routine histological and immunohistochemistry
(IHC)-based examination as per standard protocol for staging
and grading.
Drugs and chemicals
CCK-8 assay reagent (Dojindo); rapamycin (Sirolimus) and
AKT inhibitor, MK-2206 (Selleck Chemicals), were purchased,
dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and stored in aliquots
as per the recommendations from manufacturers.
Tumor explant culture and drug treatment
For ex vivo analysis of tumor response to targeted drugs,
uniform tumor sections were maintained in quadruplicates

www.aacrjournals.org

in 48-well plates in media supplemented with 20% FBS (Invitrogen), 1 GlutaMAX (Invitrogen), and appropriate concentration of antibiotics/antimycotics (Invitrogen; ref. 19). Tumor
sections were treated with DMSO, MK-2206 (1 mmol/L),
rapamycin (Sirolimus; 10 mmol/L), or combination of rapamycin and MK-2206 for 72 hours. In combination group,
tumors were treated with rapamycin for 8 hours followed
by incubation for another 64 hours with MK-2206. Medium
was changed every 24 hours. The tissue slices at baseline
time (T0) and thereafter harvested at 72 hours (T72) were
assessed for cell viability and submitted for histopathologic
evaluation.
Tumor viability study
Tumor cell viability was assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8
(CCK-8; Dojindo) using CCK-8 reagent as per manufacturer's recommendations. One-tenth volume of CCK-8 solution was added to each well and incubated at 37 C for
3 hours in a humidiﬁed CO2 chamber. Absorbance was
measured at 450 nm. Samples at baseline (T0) were used
as calibrators to normalize intersample variation in absorbance readings. Tissue viability of drug-treated samples was
expressed as a percentage of viability relative to DMSOtreated controls.
Immunohistochemical analysis
Tumors were ﬁxed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded
in parafﬁn. About 5-mm sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Antigen retrieval was done in Vector
Antigen Unmasking Solution (citrate-based, Vector Laboratories) by exposure to microwave heating for 30 minutes.
Quenching of endogenous peroxidase was done, and protein
blocking was carried out at room temperature for 1 hour with
10% goat serum. Sections were incubated with primary antibody at below mentioned conditions followed by incubation
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody
(SignalStain Boost IHC Detection Reagent; Cell Signaling
Technology) for 1 hour at room temperature. Chromogenic
development of signal was done using 3,30 -diaminobenzidine
(DAB Peroxidase Substrate Kit; Vector Laboratories). Tissues
were counterstained with hematoxylin (Papanicolaous solution 1a; Merck). Rabbit monoclonal phospho-AKT (Ser473;
D9E) and phospho-AMPKa (Thr172; clone 40H9, Cell Signaling
Technology) were used at 1:50 and 1:100 dilutions, respectively,
for overnight incubation at 4 C. Rabbit monoclonal phosphoS6 ribosomal protein (pS6RP; Ser235/236; D57.2.2E) and phospho-PRAS40 (Thr246, C77D7; Cell Signaling Technology) were
used at 1:200 dilution for overnight incubation at 4 C; rabbit
polyclonal GLUT1 (Abcam) at a 1:200 dilution was used for 1hour incubation at room temperature; rabbit polyclonal Ki67
(Vector Laboratories) was used at 1:600 dilution for 1 hour at
room temperature. Induction of apoptosis was detected by
staining for cleaved caspase-3 using polyclonal anti-cleaved
caspase-3 (Asp175) antibody (rabbit polyclonal, Cell Signaling
Technology) at 1:600 dilution for 1 hour at room temperature.
Matched IgG isotype control (rabbit monoclonal IgG, DA1E,
and mouse monoclonal IgG1, G3A1, Cell Signaling Technology)
were used for each primary antibody. Each slide was

as the control gene, and the relative fold change was calculated
against a control head and neck tissue for HIF-1a.

Western blotting
SDS-PAGE–separated protein samples were transferred to
polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PVDF) membrane. Membranes
were incubated with primary antibodies against pS6RP
(Ser235/236, Cell Signaling Technology), GLUT1 (Abcam),
and Tubulinb (Imgenex) and detected by Enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham, GE Lifesciences).

Statistical analysis
One-way ANOVA, linear regression, and Spearman coefﬁcient of correlation were analyzed using GraphPad Prism
version 5 for Windows.

Reverse-phase protein array
PathScan RTK Signaling Antibody Array Kit (Cell Signaling
Technology) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions to simultaneously detect 28 receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTK) and 11 downstream signaling nodes. Tissue slices were
lysed with 1 cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology), and
protein estimation was carried out by modiﬁed Lowry method
(Bio-Rad's DC Protein Assay). Diluted lysates were added to
each well in the slide at the concentration of 1 mg/mL, and
chemiluminescent signals were captured using digital imaging
system. Spot intensity was quantiﬁed using image analysis
software.
Real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated from head and neck squamous cell
cancer tissues (5 mg) using an RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen).
About 1 mg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the
High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocol (See Supplementary Tables S2 and S3 for primer information). Each
PCR was carried out in 20 mL reaction mix, containing 10 mL of
SYBR select master mix (Applied Biosystems), 200 nmol/L
primers, and 100 ng of cDNA. The ampliﬁed products were
run on 1% agarose gel to verify the correct product size—HIF1a (145 bp). All the samples were normalized using 18S rRNA

Results
Expression of GLUT1 correlates with mTOR pathway
activation in primary human head and neck tumors
PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis is deregulated in HNCs. We
evaluated mTOR activation by the IHC analysis of pS6RP in
HNC tumor samples (n ¼ 22) at baseline (Fig. 1A). To understand whether the pS6RP expression is reﬂective of activation
of AKT in these tumors, we conducted pAKT IHC (Fig. 1A). Of
the 22 samples assessed, 9 samples exhibited elevated levels of
pS6RP (score is 3), 4 samples had intermediate level of
expression (score is >1–<3), and 9 samples had null or low
expression of pS6RP (score is 1; Fig. 1B). However, elevated
levels of pS6RP expression were observed in tumors lacking
endogenous aberrant pAKT activation, indicating that mTOR
activation was not contingent upon pAKT status in these
tumors (Fig. 1A). GLUT1 is one of the downstream effectors
of mTOR signaling, and we wanted to understand whether
GLUT1 expression is deregulated in these tumors. Various
cellular patterns of GLUT1 staining were observed within
individual tumors, including surface and cytoplasmic expression (Fig. 2B and data not shown). On the basis of the
intensities and number of GLUT1-positive cells, tumors were
divided into 3 groups: high expression (score ¼ 4), medium
expression (score ¼ 1–3), and low/null expression group (score
¼ 1). Activated AKT, S6RP, and GLUT1 are expressed primarily in these tumors as compared with adjacent normal
tissues (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1). On comparing the
expression levels of these 2 biomarkers, we observed that

D, total protein was isolated from very low, medium, and high pS6RP-expressing tumors, separated using SDS-PAGE, blotted on PVDF membrane,
and incubated with antibodies against GLUT1 and pS6RP. Membranes were reprobed with anti-tubulin.

tumors exhibiting high pS6RP expression also expressed elevated levels of GLUT1, and tumors with medium or low/null
levels of pS6RP had a similar pattern of GLUT1 expression,
indicating that a linear correlation exists between expression
of pS6RP and GLUT1 (Fig. 2A and B). This was also independently conﬁrmed by Western blotting experiments (Fig. 2D).
To delineate whether the GLUT1 expression is linked to HIF1a, a downstream effector of mTOR, we assessed baseline
levels of HIF-1a in these tumors. Our data indicate that the
observed levels of GLUT1 correlates positively with HIF-1a
levels in these tumors (Fig. 2C). A large body of literature links
GLUT1 expression to FDG uptake, and we wanted to assess
whether FDG uptake of these tumors could be used as an
independent indicator of the mTOR activation status. Toward
this end, we compared the FDG uptake with pS6RP and GLUT1
expression levels. Of the 22 patients evaluated, no discernible
correlation emerged between the levels of FDG uptake (available from the PET-CT data) and the pS6RP or GLUT1 expression status (Supplementary Fig. S2A–S2D). Similarly when the
proliferation status was compared with FDG uptake, it did not
evince any statistical correlation (Supplementary Fig. S2A and
S2B). These data collectively suggest that neither FDG uptake
by the tumors nor the proliferation status is indicative of

mTOR pathway activation status, whereas pS6RP and GLUT1
are reliable indicators of the same in HNCs (Fig. 2A).
Induction of AKT activation by rapamycin in primary
head and neck tumors
Having established the mTOR activation status in these
primary tumors, we assessed their functional response to the
mTOR inhibitor rapamycin using the ex vivo tumor explant
platform. The tumors having low/null levels of pS6RP (9 of 22)
were not sensitive to rapamycin treatment as expected,
because the mTOR axis was not deregulated in these tumors
(data not shown). We observed contrasting sensitivities to
rapamycin treatment in mTOR deregulated tumors expressing
high/medium levels of pS6RP (13 of 22 tumors), wherein only a
small subset of tumors (15%, 2 of 13) were responsive. These
tumors had decreased cell viability and proliferation coupled
with increased caspase-3 activation on treatment with rapamycin compared with the DMSO control (Fig. 3A–C). The
majority of tumors (11 of 13) were insensitive to rapamycin,
as this treatment affected neither the tumor cell viability nor
their proliferation (Fig. 4A–C), indicating that mTOR inhibition
was not sufﬁcient to mediate tumor inhibition. The induction
of the feedback activation of AKT (Figs. 3 and 4 and data not

shown) along with a reduction in GLUT1 expression (Supplementary Fig. S3A) was observed in all pS6RP-positive tumors
treated with rapamycin.
Abrogating rapamycin-induced feedback activation of AKT
by MK-2206 does not enhance antitumor effect in the majority
of tumors. Activation of AKT and concomitant attenuation of
growth-inhibitory effects of mTOR inhibitors is largely mediated through IRS-1 signaling (21). Cotargeting the AKT feedback loop, in addition to mTOR pathway, has been suggested as
a strategy to overcome the loss of inhibitory effect of mTOR
inhibitors. To know whether the abrogation of mTOR inhibition–mediated negative feedback enhanced antitumor effect,
we treated tumors with rapamycin followed by MK-2206 in an
ex vivo explant setting. In 18% of rapamycin-insensitive tumors,
tumor cell viability dropped signiﬁcantly (Fig. 5A) along with
tumor cell proliferation (Fig. 5B and C), and a concomitant
increase in activation of caspase-3 was observed (Fig. 5B and
D). Rapamycin-mediated upregulation of pAKT (S473) and
phosphorylation of AKT substrate PRAS40 were also observed.
This feedback loop was subsequently blocked by the addition
of MK-2206 in all tumor tissues (Figs. 4B and 5B and data not
shown). However, 82% of rapamycin-insensitive tumors, when
treated with combination of rapamycin and MK-2206, failed to
show any effect on cell viability (Fig. 6A), cell death (Fig. 6B and
C), and cell proliferation (Fig. 6B and C) as compared with
DMSO-treated tumors (in 11 of 13 tumors), suggesting that this
combination strategy was effective only in a limited number of
tumors. Ablation of the rapamycin-induced pAKT activation
was seen in the combination treatment group, as evinced by

the decrease of pPRAS40 and pAKT levels (but not total AKT,
Supplementary Fig. S3B) compared with rapamycin, but this
did not translate to tumor-inhibitory efﬁcacy in the majority of
the patient tumors. These observations collectively suggest
that cotargeting mTOR and AKT activation loop does not
uniformly induce antitumor response, as tumor dependence
on this pathway for survival and maintenance varies in these
primary HNCs.
Deregulation of multiple pathways linked to
proliferation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis in mTOR
activated tumors resistant to combination treatment
To elucidate putative mechanism(s) of resistance observed
in the nonresponders to dual treatment, we conducted reversephase protein array (RPPA) proﬁling of these tumors at baseline (Fig. 6D and E). Our data indicated that many of these
activated receptors and their nodal downstream molecules
such as EGF receptor (EGFR) and related proteins were
expressed at much higher levels in this subset than in the
responder tumors. Other RTKs such as M-CSFR and c-KIT that
may drive growth and proliferation were also expressed at
elevated levels in the nonresponders. Overexpression of
pSTAT3 was observed in these tumors (Fig. 6D and E), and
previous reports have shown that elevated levels of pSTAT3
result in anti-apoptotic and proliferative response. These
tumors were further assessed for expression of speciﬁc genes
implicated in apoptosis, such as BCL2. Data indicate that the
nonresponders have very high levels of the anti-apoptotic
effector BCL2 than responders (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Total

EGFR expression levels were also elevated in the subset of
nonresponders (Supplementary Fig. S4B). The expression
levels of selected proteins in the activated pathways were
further conﬁrmed by IHC, wherein elevated levels of total
EGFR, pEGFR, and pSTAT3 were observed in nonresponsive
samples (Supplementary Fig. S4C). Collectively, these data
indicate that there are diverse mechanisms that drive tumor
maintenance and progression with multistep intrinsic deregulation contributing towards resistance to a variety of antineoplastic agents in HNCs.

Discussion
Carcinogenesis is a complex mechanism known to be
orchestrated by multistep genetic changes. Recent studies
indicate that there is an intrinsic pathway bias for the response
and resistance to chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Despite
several advances in the understanding of disease progression
in a setting such as HNCs, the overall survival is severely
limited. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is perturbed in a
majority of cancers (10), and our data indicate a similar ﬁnding
in the HNCs. While a majority of the tumors had elevated/
intermediate levels of pS6RP expression, this expression did
not correlate with activation of AKT. In the tumors that had
high/intermediate levels of pS6RP, a linear correlation with
pAKT expression was not present hinting at activation of other
upstream effectors of mTOR.

as GLUT1, we investigated the expression status of GLUT1 and
its relation to HIF-1a levels. Our data suggested the existence of
a positive correlation with respect to expression of pS6RP with
GLUT1 and GLUT1 with HIF-1a in clinical biopsies from
patients with HNCs. On the basis of our data as well as other
published ﬁndings linking GLUT1 to mTOR pathway (22), it
may potentially be used as a biomarker for mTOR status in
HNCs. However, a study with larger number of patients with
HNCs is required for the use of GLUT1 as a biomarker for
mTOR activation in clinical setting. Research aimed at examining the signiﬁcance of GLUT1 expression and FDG uptake in
a variety of solid cancers has been carried out with conﬂicting
results (23, 24). However, the metabolic status of a tumor and
GLUT1 expression in oral carcinomas has not been systematically analyzed. The signiﬁcance, if any, of FDG uptake in the
context of mTOR activation status in HNCs need to be investigated further. Our ﬁndings are in agreement with Hong and
Lim, wherein we observed that GLUT1 expression status of the
tumors and the FDG uptake in the corresponding patients with
HNCs do not correlate (25), and comparison of the SUV data
with either the Ki-67 or pS6RP failed to yield any statistical
correlation. These data indicate that the FDG uptake by
tumors, while used by many as a prognostic indicator of
survival, would have limited potential for use as a marker of
GLUT1 expression or status of mTOR activation and proliferation. Tumors with elevated levels of pS6RP, a downstream
target of mTOR, were inhibited by the use of rapamycin in
transgenic models (15, 26). Our observations while in complete

Figure 5. Targeted ablation of rapamycin-mediated upregulation of AKT signaling is key for antitumor effect in a subset of rapamycin-insensitive tumors. Tumor
sections were cultured with DMSO or rapamycin (Rapa) or inhibitor of AKT (MK-2206) and combination of rapamycin and MK-2206 for 3 days. A, cell viability

(Ac-Cas-3) as indicated. Image magniﬁcation, 20 and insets, 40. C, number of Ki-67-positive and -negative cells was counted in the entire sections

concordance with the fact that pS6RP level is indicative of
mTOR status suggest that the potential value of pS6RP as a
prognostic indicator of response to mTOR inhibitors is
rather limited. To further assess the functional response of
these tumors to mTOR inhibitors, we used an ex vivo tumor
explant culture system to delineate the dependence of these
tumors on the mTOR. This explant system provides a
platform to evaluate drug response of individual tumor
tissues while preserving the native tumor microenvironment
(19). This system is especially relevant to evaluate drug
response of tumors to AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitors as it
has been shown that epithelial–stromal interactions significantly alter drug response (27) and that tumor microenvironment is crucial for studying tumor biology (28). Using
this model, we found that only a small subset of tumors with
elevated/intermediate levels of pS6RP were responsive to
rapamycin (15%), suggesting mTOR is the driver of these
HNCs as reported in other tumors (16). Tumors with low/
null expression of pS6RP (indicative of the absence of an
activated target mTOR) as expected failed to respond to this
mTOR inhibitor.
Clinically, it has been observed that mTOR inhibitor
performance was modest at best and resulted in disease
progression at worst and a variety of mechanisms have been

1124

described to explain this. The discovery of a "feedback loop
culminating in AKT activation" initiated upon treatment
with rapamycin has prompted further clinical investigations
and in some cases can explain the attenuation seen in
antitumor activity of rapamycin (9). Recent ﬁndings indicate
that the suppression of mTOR/S6K1 inhibition–mediated
AKT activation is triggered via IGF1R/PI3K signaling to AKT
(21, 29). As multiple signaling pathways impinge on the
mTOR network, rationally designed cotargeting strategy for
clinical management of HNCs is required to regulate tumor
growth, recurrence, and resistance. We evaluated the relative merits of the cotargeting approach, by assessing the
response of HNC tumors to the combined rapamycin and
MK-2206 treatment in ex vivo setting. The combination
therapy did not evince any signiﬁcant improvement over
the single agent in a subset of tumors (41%) that were in the
low/null category for pS6RP and GLUT1 (data not shown).
These ﬁndings are in line with previously published reports
that indicate these inhibitors are efﬁcacious only in the
presence of persistently activated target (15). However, in
the samples that had elevated levels of pS6RP (59%; indicative of persistent activation of the mTOR network), only
15% tumors were sensitive to rapamycin. The feedback
activation of AKT observed on treatment with rapamycin

Figure 6. Cotargeting mTOR and AKT using pharmacologic inhibitors ablate rapamycin-induced feedback activation of AKT but does not elicit
antitumor efﬁcacy in majority of rapamycin-insensitive HNC tumors. Tumor sections were cultured with DMSO (vehicle control), rapamycin (Rapa), AKT
inhibitor (MK-2206), or rapamycin and MK-2206 combination (Rapa þ MK-2206) for 3 days. A, cell viability was determined by WST assay, and percentage of
cell viability was calculated. Shown here are viability data (mean of triplicates  SE). B, after WST assays, tumors were ﬁxed and embedded in parafﬁn. Tumors
sections were stained with H&E (top row), cell proliferation marker (Ki-67), apoptotic marker (Ac-Cas-3), and antibodies against pS6RP, pAKT, and
pPRAS as indicated. All images were taken at 20 and insets were taken at 40 magniﬁcation. C, numbers of Ki67-positive and -negative cells and number of
activated caspase-3–positive and -negative cells were counted in all sections of all groups (in triplicates). Percentage of Ki67- and caspase-3–positive cells
was calculated and plotted. Data are mean  SE, and statistical analysis was conducted by ANOVA. D, targeted phosphoprotein expression proﬁling
was carried out using total proteins extracted from Rapa þ MK-2206 sensitive (bottom) and resistant (top) tumors at baseline. Spots are in duplicate,
and each pair corresponds to a speciﬁc phosphoprotein (pEGFR and pSTAT3). E, intensity of each phosphoprotein was calculated by densitometry analysis

was ablated on addition of MK-2206 (in the combination
treatment group) in all the 13 mTOR-activated tumors.
Interestingly, in 82% of rapamycin-insensitive tumors, the
MK-2206 and rapamycin combination did not exert a signiﬁcant antitumor effect despite abrogation of signaling
arising from feedback activation of AKT on rapamycin
treatment. Recent reports based on cell line and clinical
response biomarker analysis indicate that the rapamycinmediated AKT activation observed is actually common and
greater in rapamycin-sensitive cells and tumors than in
rapamycin-insensitive cells (21). These ﬁndings point to the
fact that the feedback loop activation of AKT, while not a
marker of resistance, may actually function as an pharmacodynamic indicator of rapamycin activity (21). There are
several possible mechanistic scenarios that could potentially
explain this observation. Development of resistance to
mTORC1 inhibitors has been correlated to the presence of
different feedback loops initiated upon mTOR inhibition,
and it has been shown that AKT inhibition induces expression and phosphorylation of several RTKs (30). The Bcl2

www.aacrjournals.org

family plays a major role in the biology of HNC (31), and
elevated levels of BCL2 observed in the resistant tumors
(Supplementary Fig. S4) could potentially impact mTOR
inhibitors via cross talk with parallel pathways as evinced,
in part, by the absence of apoptosis induction on treatment
with this combination (Fig. 6C). Another plausible mechanism of resistance to mTOR inhibitors elucidated in squamous cell carcinomas is that rapamycin treatment induced
transactivation of EGFR (32). Our data indicate that multiple
pathways involved in survival and proliferation are aberrantly activated in the tumors nonresponsive to dual
treatment. Overexpression of the EGFR family of proteins
speciﬁcally EGFR along with increased levels of STAT3 is
observed at baseline in this subset (Supplementary Fig. S4C).
Cross-talk between these potential pathways to activate
prosurvival signaling has been implicated in resistance to
therapy in HNCs (33, 34) and could potentially contribute to
the resistance to therapy observed in these tumors. In the
context of nonresponders, we hypothesize that overexpression of c-KIT could play a role in promoting tumor

proliferation and thereby mediate resistance (35). We have
looked at other intersecting pathways that are commonly
deregulated in HNCs and a variety of other indications by
proﬁling key genes such as HRAS, KRAS, PIK3CA, BRAF, and
LKB1 (data not shown and Supplementary Table S2). Results
showed that none of the primary tumors had mutations in
HRAS, KRAS, PIK3CA, and BRAF but for 5 tumors that had
mutations only in LKB1 (Supplementary Fig. S5A), a tumor
suppressor gene implicated in aberrant mTOR activation via
AMPK pathway (36, 37). We report here a novel LKB1
mutation (Ala-Val) in exon 5 (at codon 206) that was
detected in 55% of nonresponders to combination therapy
(Supplementary Table S2 and Supplementary Fig. S5A and
S5B). It is reported that the presence of an Ala-Thr mutation
in exon 5 (at codon 205) implicated the loss of AMPK
activation in HNCs (38), however, the functional signiﬁcance
of the novel mutation is unknown.
The collective observations from this study warrant further detailed characterization of the various pathways that
are intrinsically deregulated in these HNCs and provide a
rationale for clinical development of mTOR inhibitors in
varying combinations. While cotargeting or synchronized
combinatorial therapy is a powerful approach to maximize
hits and bring about enhanced anticancer effect, clinical
trials conducted in the absence of appropriate patient
stratiﬁcation turn out to be less than successful. Ex vivo
functional response platform augmented by relevant biomarker proﬁling could potentially be used as a comprehensive strategy to guide targeted therapy by delineating tumor
dependence on AKT/mTOR pathways.
