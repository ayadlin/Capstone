Abstract
In the pediatric cancer neuroblastoma, clinically aggressive
disease is associated with increased levels of angiogenesis
stimulators and high vascular index. We and others have
hypothesized that blocking angiogenesis may be effective
treatment for this pediatric malignancy. However, little is
known about the efficacy of antiangiogenic agents in pediatric
malignancies. Recently, promising results have been reported
in an adult phase I study of ABT-510, a peptide derivative of
the natural angiogenic inhibitor thrombospondin-1. Histone
deacetylase inhibitors, such as valproic acid (VPA), have also
been shown to have antiangiogenic activity in several cancer
models. In this study, we evaluated the effects of ABT-510
and VPA on neuroblastoma tumor growth and angiogenesis.
Although only VPA was capable of blocking the proliferation
of neuroblastoma cells and inducing neuroblastoma cell
apoptosis in vitro, treatment with VPA or ABT-510 alone
significantly suppressed the growth of neuroblastoma xenografts established from two different MYCN-amplified cell
lines. Combination therapy more effectively inhibited the
growth of small neuroblastoma xenografts than single-agent
treatment, and in animals with large xenografts, total
cessation of tumor growth was achieved with this treatment
approach. The microvascular density was significantly reduced in the xenografts treated with combination therapy
compared with controls or tumors treated with single agents.
In addition, the number of structurally abnormal vessels was
reduced, suggesting that these agents may ‘‘normalize’’ the
tumor vasculature. Our results indicate that ABT-510 combined with VPA may be an effective antiangiogenic treatment
strategy for children with high-risk neuroblastoma. [Cancer

Introduction
The clinical hallmark of neuroblastoma is heterogeneity, with the
likelihood of tumor progression varying widely according to age at
diagnosis and extent of disease (1). In addition to these clinical
factors, biological markers, such as MYCN gene status, tumor cell
ploidy, and tumor histology, have also been shown to be strongly
predictive of risk of relapse (2). Modern treatment strategies are
stratified according to these clinical and biological classifiers, and

substantial progress has been made in the treatment of children
with low- and intermediate-risk neuroblastoma with reduced
therapy approaches. However, more effective therapy is still needed
for children with high-risk disease. Despite intensive multimodality
treatment, <30% of high-risk patients are cured (1). Similar to other
solid tumors, angiogenesis is required for neuroblastoma tumor
growth and metastasis. The majority of published studies indicate
that angiogenesis contributes to the aggressive behavior of
neuroblastoma tumors, and a positive correlation between poor
outcome and high levels of factors that stimulate blood vessel
growth and vascular index has been reported (3, 4). In addition,
preclinical experiments have shown that angiogenesis inhibitors
are capable of suppressing neuroblastoma growth, further supporting the concept that the blood vessels in neuroblastoma tumors are
likely to be clinically relevant therapeutic targets (5, 6).
Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is a well-known natural inhibitor of
angiogenesis, and down-regulation of TSP-1 plays a critical role in
the angiogenic switch in several tumor types (7–9). In neuroblastoma, we have previously shown that TSP-1 is epigenetically
silenced in a subset of undifferentiated, advanced-stage tumors and
cell lines, whereas it is expressed in tumors with morphologic
evidence of neuroblast differentiation (10). The antiangiogenic
effect of TSP-1 is mediated in part by the CD36 receptor, which
triggers a signaling cascade that leads to apoptosis in activated
endothelial cells via the CD95 death receptor. The inhibitory
activity of TSP-1 has been mapped to the properdin type 1 repeats
in the NH2-terminal third of the molecule, and a single substitution
of D-isoleucine for L-isoleucine in one properdin-region heptapeptide leads to a 1,000-fold increase in the antiangiogenic activity
(11, 12). ABT-510 is a modified analogue of the active TSP-1
heptapeptide, which has slowed tumor growth in both xenograft
and syngeneic models (13). Administration of ABT-510 to TSP-1
knockout mice for 5 consecutive days has been shown to reduce by
f5-fold both elevated circulating endothelial cells and endothelial
precursor cells to near wild-type levels (14). Although no pediatric
cancer studies have been done to date, a recently completed phase
I trial of ABT-510 in adults with advanced cancer has shown a
favorable toxicity profile and a decrease in the median serum basic
fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) levels. Stable disease lasting for six
cycles or more was seen in 6 of the 39 patients enrolled on the
phase I study, and additional response data are being collected on
ongoing phase II studies (15).
Valproic acid (VPA), a branched chain fatty acid initially used for
the treatment of epilepsy, has also been shown to have anticancer
activity and is currently being tested in clinical trials. VPA inhibits
the growth of many types of cancer, including glioma, neuroblastoma (16, 17), breast cancer (18), acute myelogenous leukemia
(19, 20), thyroid cancer (21), and endometrial carcinoma (22).
Recently, VPA and IFN-a have been reported to synergistically
inhibit neuroblastoma growth, and increased anticancer activity

Valproic Acid and TSP-1 Inhibit Neuroblastoma Growth

has also been seen when VPA is combined with all-trans retinoic
acid (16, 17). Although the mechanisms responsible for the anticancer activity of VPA are not completely understood, like other
short chain fatty acids, it inhibits histone deacetylase (HDAC)
activity and plays a role in the regulation of gene expression.
Recent studies have indicated that HDAC inhibitors are also
capable of blocking hypoxia-induced and vascular endothelial
growth factor–induced angiogenesis (23).
In this study, we investigated the effects of the antiangiogenic
agent ABT-510 on neuroblastoma growth and angiogenesis.
Because the efficacy of angiogenesis inhibitors is greatly improved
when they are combined with other anticancer drugs (24, 25), we
conducted additional experiments with ABT-510 combined with
VPA. VPA was selected for the combination studies because it is
capable of inhibiting neuroblastoma cell proliferation and tumor
growth and can block HDAC activity and angiogenesis. In addition,
VPA is known to have a low toxicity profile. We found that VPA,
but not ABT-510, was capable of blocking the proliferation of
neuroblastoma cells and inducing neuroblastoma cell apoptosis
in vitro. However, treatment with either ABT-510 or VPA alone
significantly suppressed the growth of neuroblastoma xenografts
established from two different MYCN-amplified cell lines. ABT-510
combined with VPA more effectively inhibited the growth of small
tumors than single-agent therapy, and in animals with large
tumors, combination therapy stabilized tumor growth. In addition
to blocking angiogenesis, tumor cell apoptosis and inhibited tumor
cell proliferation were seen in the tumors treated with combination therapy. Our results, together with the known low toxicity
profile of both agents, suggest that VPA combined with ABT-510
may be an effective, well-tolerated antiangiogenic treatment
strategy for children with high-risk neuroblastoma.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. The biological and genetic characteristics of the SMS-KCNR
and NMB MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines used in this study have
been previously described (10). Cells were grown at 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum (FBS), L-glutamine, and antibiotics.
Peptide. ABT-510 (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) is a capped
nonapeptide based on the linear TSP-1 heptapeptide sequence containing a
fragment of the second type I TSP-1 repeat. The sequence of ABT-510 is
acetyl-sarcosine-glycine-valine-D-alloisoleucine-threonine-norvaline-isoleucine-arginine-proline-ethylamide. Lyophilized peptides were dissolved in
sterile 5% dextrose and stored at 4jC.
Proliferation assay. The in vitro proliferation of SMS-KCNR cells was
determined by using the CellTiter 96 AQ nonradioactive cell proliferation
assay (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). SMS-KCNR cells were seeded into
96-well plates at a density of 7.5  103 per well. After 24 h, ABT-510 or VPA
was added to quadruplicate wells at various concentrations in medium
containing either 10% or 2% FBS. The lower concentration of serum was
used to ensure that effects of the drugs were not counteracted by excessive
growth factors present in the serum. Following treatment for 24 to 72 h,
MTS reagent was added and cells were further incubated for 3 h. The
absorbance of the samples was measured using a Synergy HT Microplate
Reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT).
Measurement of cell cycle phase distribution. Cell cycle distribution
was determined by flow cytometric analysis. Briefly, SMS-KCNR cells were
cultured in RPMI 1640 containing various concentrations of ABT-510 or
VPA for 24 h. Control cells were cultured in medium lacking ABT-510 or
VPA. Cells were then washed with PBS, fixed in 70% ethanol, and
hypotonically lysed in 1 mL of DNA staining solution [0.05 mg/mL
propidium iodide (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and 0.1% Triton X-100]. The cells
were incubated, while protected from light, at 4jC overnight before analysis.

The experiment was done in duplicate. The cell cycle data were analyzed
with an Epics XL-MCL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL), with
System II (version 3.0) software (Beckman Coulter). Further analysis of cell
cycle distribution was determined by using ModFit LT (Verity Software
House, Topsham, ME).
Annexin V/propidium iodide staining. Apoptosis and/or necrosis were
evaluated using two-color flow cytometric analysis with fluorescein-labeled
Annexin V and propidium iodide (10). Cells were fluorescein labeled using
methods provided by the manufacturer of the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis
Detection kit (Immunotech, Marseille, France). The experiment was done
in duplicate. In brief, cultured neuroblastoma cell lines were treated with
10, 100, and 1,000 nmol/L of ABT-510 for 24 h. Cells were washed twice
with PBS and resuspended at 1  106/mL in binding buffer with FITCconjugated Annexin V and propidium iodide. Samples were analyzed using
the Epics XL-MCL flow cytometer.
Endothelial cell migration assay. Endothelial cell migration assays
were done in a modified Boyden chamber (NeuroProbe, Gaithersburg, MD)
with human microvascular endothelial cells (Cambrex Corp., East
Rutherford, NJ) in EBM medium (Cambrex) containing 0.01% bovine serum
albumin as described previously (26, 27). Test substances were assayed with
or without 5 ng/mL bFGF (National Cancer Institute Preclinical Repository,
Bethesda, MD). To generate dose-response curves, the data were normalized
as percentage of maximum migration using the difference between bFGF/
EBM-induced migration and background migration in EBM alone as 100%
control. The experiment was done in triplicate.
cDNA synthesis and Taqman assay. Total RNA (2 Ag) was used for
reverse transcription using SuperScript III (Invitrogen) and 50 Amol/L
oligo(dT)20 in a 20 AL reaction volume according to standard protocols
supplied by the manufacturer. cDNA synthesis was done at 50jC for
50 min. Following heat inactivation at 85jC for 5 min and RNase H
treatment at 37jC for 20 min, 480 AL distilled water was added and 3 AL of
diluted cDNA were used for Taqman analysis. Taqman reactions were set
up containing 1 Taqman Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 250 nmol/L FAM-labeled specific probe, and
900 nmol/L forward and reverse primers in a 20 AL reaction. All assays
were carried out in a 96-well format. Real-time fluorescent detection of PCR
products was done with an Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR
System using the following thermocycling conditions: 1 cycle of 50jC for
2 min and 95jC for 20 s; 40 cycles of 95jC for 3 s and 60jC for 30 s. The
sequences for the primers and probes for MYCN, TSP-1, SPARC, and
b2-microglobulin were described previously (10, 27, 28). Data were analyzed
using the comparative method (DDC t) to calculate relative quantities of
a nucleic acid sequence. Nontreated SMS-KCNR and NMB were used as the
calibrator sample, and h2-microglobulin was used as an endogenous
control detector.
Neuroblastoma xenograft studies. Four- to 6-week-old female
homozygous athymic nude mice (Harlan, Madison, WI) were inoculated
s.c. into the right flank with 1  107 SMS-KCNR or 1.25  107 NMB cells.
Once tumors were palpable (70 mm3), mice were treated once daily for
20 days with either ABT-510 (i.p., 40 mg/kg), VPA (i.p., 400 mg/kg), or ABT510 and VPA in combination. In separate experiments, treatment was
started after the animals developed larger tumors z380 mm3 in size and
continued for 10 days. Tumor volumes were measured twice weekly and
calculated using the following formula: tumor volume = (length  width2) /
2 (29). The Student’s t test was used to compare tumor size in the control
and treatment groups. Mice were sacrificed after 20 or 10 days of treatment,
respectively. Animals were treated according to NIH guidelines for animal
care and use, and protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use
Committee at Northwestern University.
Quantification of apoptosis. In situ detection of cleaved, apoptotic
DNA fragments was done using the In Situ Cell Death Detection kit (Roche
Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN) as described previously (30). Sections of
human colon mucosa processed similarly to the xenografts were included in
each assay. To check the intra-assay and interassay consistency, the
apoptotic bodies in colonic mucosa, stained as the first and last slide of
each assay, were assessed. The assays were considered adequate only when
the frequency of apoptosis on the two sections of colonic mucosa was

similar. Each terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick
end labeling (TUNEL) in situ–labeled section was quantified using a
Leica (Heidelberg, Germany) DM IRB inverted fluorescence microscope
equipped with Image-Pro Plus version 4.5 software (Media Cybernetics,
Silver Spring, MD) at a magnification of 400. The frequency of labeled
apoptotic cells was obtained by quantifying 10 consecutive fields starting
with areas with the highest number of TUNEL-labeled nuclei, avoiding areas
of necrosis, and expressed as apoptosis per 10 high-power fields (HPF).
Immunohistochemical studies. Xenograft tissue was fixed in 10%
formaldehyde/zinc fixative (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA)
and embedded in paraffin. Serial sections (4 Am thick) were deparaffinized
and rehydrated as described previously (31). Sections of each tumor were
stained with H&E, and selected sections were stained with Masson’s
trichrome special staining. Additional sections were used for immunohistochemistry. Antigen retrieval was done with 0.01 mol/L citrate buffer
(pH 6.0) for Ki-67 or 1 mmol/L EDTA (pH 8.0) for CD31 antibody, heated
in a boiling steamer for 20 min, and then cooled down to room
temperature for 20 min. For analysis of proliferation rate, slides were
incubated with Ki-67 (clone MIB-1, 1:200; DakoCytomation, Carpinteria,
CA) mouse anti-human monoclonal antibody. CD31 (platelet/endothelial
cell adhesion molecule 1, M-20, 1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA) polyclonal goat anti-mouse antibody was used to highlight

endothelial cells. Primary antibodies were incubated in a humidity
chamber overnight at 4jC. The staining for Ki-67 was developed using
the DAKO Envision+ System-HRP (DakoCytomation) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The CD31 goat anti-mouse primary antibody
was bridged by biotinylated anti-goat IgG (1:200) and detected with
streptavidin (1:400; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Sections were
counterstained with Gill’s hematoxylin. In addition, the primary antibodies
were omitted in each assay to ensure the specificity. Immunohistochemistry for TSP-1 expression was done as described previously (10). Mean
vascular density (MVD) was quantified by measuring pixels in 10
consecutive fields at 200 magnification.
Morphologic evaluation of blood vessels. Blood vessel morphology and
tumor histology were evaluated by a pathologist (R.Z.) on H&E-stained
sections. The presence or absence of hemorrhage was evaluated, and tumor
blood vessels were classified morphologically into four types. Vessels were
counted, and the percentage of each vessel type in the tissue section was
calculated. Type 1 vessels had disorganized cellular proliferation with poorly
formed lumina and vascular endothelial proliferation (VEP). Type 2 vessels
were structurally more normal, thin walled, and capillary like. Type 3
vessels were structurally similar to type 2 vessels but were embedded in
fibrocollagenous stroma. Type 4 vessels had concentric layers of cells within
a thickened wall often accompanied by fibrinoid necrosis and vasculitis.

Evan’s blue dye assay. The Evan’s blue dye assay was used to assess
tumor microvascular permeability as described previously (32). Evan’s blue
dye (2%, 100 AL; MP Biomedicals, Aurora, OH) was given via tail vein
injection of tumor-bearing mice and allowed to circulate for 20 min. To
remove remaining intravascular dye, mice were perfused with 25 mL saline
through the left ventricle with a right atrial vent. Tumors were excised, cut
into pieces, and weighed. Formamide was added at a ratio of 1 mL/100 mg
of tissue and let stand for 72 h at room temperature to facilitate the
extraction of Evan’s blue dye. Tissues were then removed and resultant
extract was centrifuged. The levels of Evan’s blue were quantified using a
spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 620 nm. The amount of Evan’s blue
dye remaining in the tumor reflects the degree of intratumoral vessel
permeability. All samples were run in duplicate and compared with those of
standards.
Statistical analysis. The two-tailed Student’s t test was used to compare
the statistical significance of differences between the mean values of
quantification of apoptosis, proliferation, CD31-positive vessels, and
permeability in the neuroblastoma xenografts comparing vehicle-treated
with ABT-510, VPA, and combination-treated groups. ANOVA followed by
Dunnett’s multiple comparison procedure was used to compare the
statistical significance of differences between control and treatment groups
for sub-G1 and cell cycle analysis.

Results
VPA, but not ABT-510, inhibits neuroblastoma cell proliferation, blocks cell cycle progression, and induces apoptosis. To
investigate the effects of VPA and ABT-510 as single agents on
neuroblastoma cell growth in vitro, SMS-KCNR neuroblastoma cells
were cultured in a range of drug concentrations. As shown in
Supplementary Fig. S1, treatment with ABT-510 did not inhibit the
proliferation of SMS-KCNR neuroblastoma cells even at concentrations as high as 1,000 nmol/L (Supplementary Fig. S1A and C).
In contrast, VPA significantly inhibited neuroblastoma cell proliferation at concentrations of 5 and 10 mmol/L of VPA when the
cells were cultured in medium containing either 10% or 2% serum
(P < 0.01, respectively; Supplementary Fig. S1B and D). Furthermore, 2.5, 5.0, and 10 mmol/L of VPA induced neuroblastoma cell
apoptosis as shown by the increased population of sub-G1 cells
(P = 0.0014, P = 0.0008, and P < 0.0001, respectively; Fig. 1B), and
cell cycle analysis revealed that treatment with VPA at concentrations of 2.5, 5.0, and 10 mmol/L induced G2 growth arrest
(P = 0.0003, 0.0002, and 0.0004, respectively; Fig. 1C). Neither
apoptosis (Fig. 1A) nor changes in cell cycle (Fig. 1C) were seen
with ABT-510 (P > 0.01).
VPA and ABT-510 inhibit bFGF-induced endothelial cell
migration. To test the antiangiogenic activity of VPA and ABT-510,
endothelial cell migration assays were done using a range of drug
concentrations in the presence or absence of bFGF. bFGF-induced
endothelial cell migration was inhibited by ABT-510 and VPA in a
dose-dependent manner at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100
nmol/L and 10 nmol/L to 1 mmol/L, respectively (Fig. 1D).
VPA down-regulates MYCN expression and induces TSP-1
and SPARC expression in neuroblastoma cells. Because MYCN
plays a critical role in the regulation of neuroblastoma cell
proliferation and apoptosis, we examined the levels of MYCN
mRNA expression in neuroblastoma cells following treatment with
1 mmol/L VPA by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR
(RT-PCR). As shown in Supplementary Fig. S2A and B, MYCN
expression was significantly down-regulated in both SMS-KCNR
and NMB cell lines within 2 h of treatment. In contrast, MYCN
expression did not significantly change following treatment with
100 nmol/L ABT-510 (data not shown). To determine if the

antiangiogenic activity of VPA was due, at least in part, to upregulation of endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis in neuroblastoma cells, we also evaluated the level of expression of TSP-1 and
SPARC by RT-PCR in the SMS-KCNR neuroblastoma cells following
treatment with VPA. We found that treatment with 1 mmol/L VPA
for 24 h resulted in up-regulation of the level of TSP-1 and SPARC
expression (Supplementary Fig. S2C and D).
VPA and ABT-510 inhibit neuroblastoma xenograft growth.
To examine the antitumor effects of VPA and ABT-510, nude
mice with xenografts (f70 mm3 in size) established from two
different MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines were treated
with each agent alone and in combination. Tumor growth was
inhibited with single-agent therapy, and enhanced effects were
seen with combination therapy. After 20 days of treatment with
VPA combined with ABT-510, tumor volume was reduced by
91% (P < 0.001; Fig. 2A) in the SMS-KCNR model and by 87% in the
NMB xenografts (P = 0.029; Fig. 2B) compared with controls.
Because the effectiveness of some antiangiogenic strategies is
inversely related to tumor burden, we repeated our studies in a set
of animals with large xenografts that were z380 mm3 in size. As

shown in Fig. 2C, control tumor volumes increased 3.5-fold over
the subsequent 10 days, and tumors in animals treated with ABT510 or VPA, respectively, showed 33% and 44% reduced growth
increases (P < 0.01 and 0.001). However, during this interval,
animals receiving combined treatment had total cessation of tumor
volume increase from the start of treatment through the entire
10-day period. Thus, the combination of ABT-510 and VPA achieved
immediate tumor growth stasis (P < 0.001), whereas the individual
treatments gave only modest inhibition.
Cell apoptosis is increased when VPA is combined with ABT510. To evaluate whether treatment induced apoptosis, TUNEL
assays were done on the neuroblastoma xenografts treated with
ABT-510, VPA, or combination therapy. The tumors treated with
ABT-510 contained significantly more apoptotic cells than the
control tumors (53 F 16 versus 34 F 9, P = 0.015; Fig. 3A). However,

the highest number of apoptotic cells was seen in the xenografts
treated with VPA alone or VPA combined with ABT-510 (93 F 13
and 141 F 39, respectively, P < 0.001).
VPA and ABT-510 inhibit neuroblastoma tumor cell proliferation in vivo. Cell proliferation in the xenografts was evaluated by
Ki-67 expression, a nuclear protein that is preferentially expressed
during active phases of the cell cycle. Ki-67–negative cells represent
quiescent G0 phase cells. A significantly higher percentage of
neuroblasts in G0 were detected in tumors treated with VPA alone
compared with control tumors (50.6 F 4.7 versus 34.2 F 9,
respectively, P < 0.01; Fig. 3B). The percentage of neuroblasts in
G0 in the control tumors and ABT-510–treated tumors was not
significantly different (34.2 F 9 versus 42.4 F 5.3, P = 0.076;
Fig. 3B). However, the percentage of G0 cells was significantly
increased in the tumors treated with combination therapy compared

P < 0.01; 86.4 F 9.1 versus 50.6 F 4.7, P < 0.01; Fig. 3B).
Treatment with ABT-510 and VPA significantly inhibits
neuroblastoma tumor angiogenesis. To investigate the antiangiogenic effects of ABT-510 and VPA, the vascularity of tumors
treated early with ABT-510, VPA, or ABT-510 and VPA in
combination was evaluated. Histologic sections were stained with
CD31 to highlight endothelial cells, and a MVD was quantified.
Compared with control tumors, a significantly lower MVD was seen
in xenografts following treatment with VPA or ABT-510 (247,805 F
73,062 versus 114,597 F 47,568 versus 75,880 F 31,638, respectively,

P = 0.00024; Fig. 3C). The MVD was significantly lower in the
tumors treated with combination therapy (247,805 F 73,062 versus
31,406 F 18,401; Fig. 3C) than in either single-agent group (P <
0.001). We also evaluated TSP-1 expression in the control and
treated SMS-KCNR tumors using immunohistochemistry to determine if the treatment with either agent alone or in combination
was capable of inducing expression of this angiogenic inhibitor. No
significant up-regulation of TSP-1 was observed in treated tumors.
VPA and ABT-510 treatment decreases hemorrhage and
modifies tumor blood vessel structure. To investigate the effects
of VPA and ABT-510 on tumor growth, treatment was initiated in
animals with tumors measuring f70 mm3. Mice were sacrificed
after 20 days of treatment, and the tumors were histologically
examined. The control NMB neuroblastoma xenografts were grossly
hemorrhagic, and extravasated RBCs were seen microscopically. The
tumor blood vessels were morphologically classified into four types
as described in Materials and Methods. More than half of the vessels
in the control neuroblastoma xenografts were structurally abnormal
with VEP (type 1 vessels; 58 F 9.04%; Fig. 4, Control, left and right;
Table 1A). The remaining vessels were thin walled and capillary like
(type 2; Fig. 4, Control, middle; Table 1A). To investigate if the
structurally abnormal vessels were related to the large size of the
control tumors, we repeated these experiments and sacrificed mice
when the tumors were similar in size to the treated tumors (ranging
from 220 to 726 mm3). Similar to the large tumors, significant
hemorrhage was present in the smaller control tumors, and the
majority of vessels were structurally abnormal and with VEP.
Tumor hemorrhage was decreased in experiments in which
treatment with ABT-510 was started when tumors were f70 mm3
in size. Significantly fewer type 1 blood vessels were observed
(7.85 F 5.35%; P = 0.0028) in these tumors, and the majority of the
vessels were thin walled (type 2 and 3 vessels; Fig. 4, ABT-510, right,
middle, and left; Table 1A). Virtually no hemorrhage was seen in
tumors treated with VPA, and the percentage of blood vessels with
VEP (type 1 vessels) decreased to 12.69 F 3.5% (P = 0.0039). The
majority of vessels in these tumors were thin walled and many were
capillary like (Fig. 4, VPA, right, middle, and left; Table 1A). Some of
the vessels were embedded in fibrocollagenous stroma, highlighted
by Masson’s trichrome special stain (type 3 vessels), and others
were arteriolar with mild hyaline sclerosis (Table 1A). In tumors
treated with VPA combined with ABT-510, hemorrhage was not

VPA-treated tumors, hemorrhage was minimal (Fig. 5, VPA, left and
middle) and the number of the type 1 vessels was only 2.09 F 0.72%
(P < 0.0001; Table 1B). Almost all of the vessels in the VPA-treated
tumors were thin walled (Fig. 5, VPA, middle and right; Table 1B).
Some vessels were capillary like (Fig. 5, VPA, middle), some
had mild hyaline sclerosis (Fig. 5, VPA, middle), and others
were embedded in fibrocollagenous stroma (Fig. 5, VPA, right; Table
1B). Minimal hemorrhage was seen in the tumors treated with both
VPA and ABT-510 (Fig. 5, ABT-510 + VPA, left and middle), and VEP
was absent. The majority of vessels in these tumors were thin
walled and classified as type 2 or 3 vessels (Fig. 5, ABT-510 + VPA,
middle; Table 1B). In three of the seven tumors treated with
combination therapy, there were small numbers of vessels with
thickened walls exhibiting concentric lamellar cellular arrangement
(‘onionskin’ pattern) with marked luminal narrowing, focal fibrosis,
fibrinoid necrosis, and vasculitis (type 4 vessels, hyperplastic
arteriolosclerosis; Fig. 5, ABT-510 + VPA, right; Table 1B).
VPA and ABT-510 treatment decreases vascular permeability.
Tumor blood vessels are functionally abnormal and leaky. To
determine if treatment with VPA and ABT-510 modified vessel
function, we assessed intratumoral vessel permeability using the
Evan’s blue dye assay. In this assay, Evan’s blue dye is given
systemically, mice are then perfused with saline to wash out the
intravascular dye, and the amount of Evan’s blue dye remaining in
the tumor correlates to permeability of the microvasculature. Our
results indicate a decrease in intratumoral vessel permeability in all
treatment groups (Fig. 6). The decrease was modest in the tumors
treated with ABT-510 alone compared with controls and did not
reach statistical significance (P = 0.124; Fig. 6). However, the
reduction in vascular permeability was statistically significant in
tumors treated with either VPA alone or in combination with ABT510 compared with controls (P = 0.044 and 0.007, respectively; Fig. 6).

control tumors (left and middle ). Hemorrhage is moderate in the tumors treated
with ABT-510 (left and middle ), minimal in VPA-treated tumors (left and middle ),
and absent following combination treatment (left and middle ). Control tumors
show extensive VEP (type 1 vessels; middle and right ). Tumors treated with
ABT-510 show a few type 1 vessels (right ) and a majority of thin-walled type 2
and 3 vessels (middle ). In the VPA-treated tumors, most vessels are thin walled,
including capillary like and arteriolar (type 2 vessels; middle ) as well as those
embedded in fibrocollagenous stroma (type 3 vessels; right ). Tumors from the
ABT-510 + VPA combination-treated group show thin-walled vessels surrounded
by fibrosis (middle). A subset of these tumors showed small vessel changes with
features of hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis (type 4 vessels; right ). Arrows,

seen and the proportion of vessels with VEP was further reduced to
3.55 F 1.12% (P = 0.0007; Table 1A). The vessels in the tumors
treated with combination therapy were thin walled and embedded
in fibrocollagenous stroma (type 3; Fig. 4, ABT-510 + VPA, left and
right) or capillary like (type 2; Fig. 4, ABT-510 + VPA, middle).
We also evaluated the effects of ABT-510 and VPA on the growth
of large established neuroblastoma tumors. Similar to the previous
experiment, significant hemorrhage was seen in the control SMSKCNR tumors that were z380 mm3 in size when treatment was
started (Fig. 5, Control, left and middle). These tumors had a
continuous network of structurally abnormal type 1 vessels (Fig. 5,
Control, right, middle, and left; Table 1B). Following treatment with
ABT-510, the tumors were less hemorrhagic than the controls
(Fig. 5, ABT-510, left and middle; Table 1B) and type 1 vessels
constituted only 14.68 F 3.83% (P < 0.0001) of the total (Fig. 5, ABT510, right). The majority of vessels were thin walled, and some were
embedded in fibrocollagenous stroma (Fig. 5, ABT-510, middle). In

Discussion
More than 30 years ago, Folkman (33) proposed the concept
that blocking angiogenesis would result in tumor dormancy.
Clinical trials in adults with cancer have supported this
hypothesis, and the antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab (Avastin)

Valproic Acid and TSP-1 Inhibit Neuroblastoma Growth

was recently granted Food and Drug Administration approval for
use in metastatic colon cancer (34). ABT-510, HDAC inhibitors,
and other promising antiangiogenic agents, either alone or in
combination with cytotoxic agents, are currently being tested in
adult clinical trials. Although we and others have reported that
the growth of common pediatric cancers, such as neuroblastoma
and Wilms’ tumor, is also angiogenesis dependent (4, 35), to
date, the experience with antiangiogenic agents in childhood
malignancies is limited. In this study, we evaluated the effects of
ABT-510 and VPA on neuroblastoma angiogenesis and tumor
growth. As expected, both agents blocked bFGF-induced
endothelial cell migration in vitro. In addition to inhibiting
angiogenesis, VPA also inhibited neuroblastoma cell proliferation
and induced neuroblastoma apoptosis. Furthermore, MYCN
expression levels were significantly down-regulated by VPA,
suggesting that this agent is capable of affecting the biology of
neuroblastoma cells. Similar changes in MYCN expression occur
in neuroblastoma following treatment with retinoic acid, a drug
that is of clinical benefit in children with high-risk neuroblastoma (36). We also found that VPA induced the expression of
endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis, including TSP-1 and
SPARC. Previous work from our laboratory has shown that
SPARC is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis in neuroblastoma
(27). In contrast, ABT-510 had no effect on the neuroblastoma
cell growth in vitro. As single agents, both ABT-510 and VPA
inhibited neuroblastoma tumor growth in vivo, and enhanced
antitumor effects were seen with combination therapy.
ABT-510 has been extensively studied in cancers that are
common in adults (15), but to our knowledge, this is the first
report showing that this agent has antiangiogenic activity in the
pediatric cancer neuroblastoma. TSP-1 and ABT-510 act by inducing
endothelial cell apoptosis, and recent studies suggest that TSP-1
generates CD95L, a ligand for the CD95 death receptor (37).
However, because CD95 expression on the vascular endothelial cell
is independent of TSP-1, the efficacy of the drug is limited. In an
effort to develop a more effective antiangiogenic treatment strategy,
ABT-510 has been combined with other agents in preclinical models
of adult cancer (38). We selected VPA for our combination studies
for several reasons. First, VPA is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis.
Although its mechanism of action remains unclear, VPA has been
shown to relieve HDAC-dependent transcription repression of
several antiangiogenic proteins (39). Second, VPA directly affects
the growth of neuroblastoma cells by inhibiting cell cycle
progression and inducing differentiation (16). Third, VPA has been
shown to have synergistic effects with other drugs that regulate
angiogenesis, including IFN-a and retinoic acid (17, 18). Finally, VPA
has limited toxicities even during long-term treatment.
Other HDAC inhibitors have also been shown to inhibit
neuroblastoma tumor growth. The hybrid polar HDAC inhibitor
m-carboxycinnamic acid bis-hydroxamide (CBHA) induces apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells in vitro and suppresses the growth
of neuroblastoma xenografts. The combination of CBHA and alltrans retinoic acid led to an even greater inhibition of tumor
growth (40). Jaboin et al. (41) reported that the synthetic
benzamide derivative MS-27-275 (MS-275) inhibited [3H]thymidine
uptake in a series of pediatric tumor cell lines and suppressed the
growth of undifferentiated sarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma, and
neuroblastoma in vivo. These investigators reported a marked
decrease in the vascularization of neuroblastoma xenografts
following treatment with MS-275. Others (42) have indicated that
trichostatin A (TSA) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid can

www.aacrjournals.org

block angiogenesis and that TSA specifically inhibits hypoxiainduced angiogenesis in the Lewis lung carcinoma model.
In the experiments done on both small and large neuroblastoma
xenografts, the combination of ABT-510 and VPA immediately and
fully stabilized the size of the tumors for 20 and 10 days,
respectively, in the NMB (early treatment) and SMS-KCNR (late
treatment) models during which time vehicle controls substantially
increased in size. The MVD was significantly lower in xenografts
treated with combination therapy compared with tumors treated
with single agents or controls. Furthermore, ABT-510 combined
with VPA induced significant apoptosis and inhibited neuroblastoma cell proliferation. Previous studies done in our laboratory
with TNP-470 showed that this antiangiogenic agent was capable of
inhibiting the growth of small neuroblastoma xenografts but did
not affect the rate of growth of large neuroblastoma tumors (5). In
contrast, we found that the combination of ABT-510 and VPA was
also capable of stabilizing the growth of large xenografts.
Hemorrhage was reduced in the neuroblastoma xenografts
treated with single-agent therapy compared with control tumors,
and virtually no hemorrhage was seen in the tumors treated with
combination therapy. In addition, striking changes in blood vessel
morphology were seen following treatment with ABT-510 and
VPA alone or in combination. Control tumors contained large
numbers of structurally abnormal blood vessels with VEP. VEP is an
established unfavorable factor in several cancers, including
melanoma, breast, prostate carcinomas, and glioblastoma (43, 44),
and it is one of the criteria for raising the WHO grade of astrocytic
neoplasms (45). The number of vessels with VEP was significantly
decreased in the treated tumors, whereas the proportion of thinwalled, capillary-like vessels was increased. Some of the thin-walled
vessels in the treated tumors were embedded in fibrocollagenous
stroma, whereas others exhibited hyaline sclerosis, a feature that is
usually seen in hypertensive disease and attributed to endothelial
cell injury (46–48). In the large SMS-KCNR tumors treated with
combination therapy, rare vessels with hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis were also seen. Using the Evan’s blue dye assay, we were also
able to show that treatment with ABT-510 and VPA resulted in
modification of vessel function with decreased permeability of the
tumor vasculature.
Our results indicate that, in addition to reducing the number of
blood vessels, the combination of ABT-510 and VPA modifies the
structure and function of the vasculature in neuroblastoma tumors.
Transient ‘‘normalization’’ of tumor vasculature following treatment
with other antiangiogenic agents has recently been reported (25).
These changes create a vasculature that is more efficient for oxygen
and drug delivery and may thereby lead to chemosensitization (34).
Thus, in addition to inhibiting neuroblastoma tumor growth directly,
it is possible that ABT-510 and VPA may also enhance the antineuroblastoma activity of cytotoxic agents. Additional studies evaluating the clinical efficacy of this antiangiogenic treatment strategy
in children with high-risk neuroblastoma are warranted.
