ABSTRACT
Despite the introduction of new treatment options for multiple myeloma (MM),
a majority of patients relapse due to the development of resistance. Unraveling new
mechanisms underlying resistance could lead to identification of possible targets
for combinatorial treatment. Using TRAF3 deleted/mutated MM cell lines, we
evaluated the role of the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 2 (cIAP2) in drug resistance
and uncovered the plausible mechanisms underlying this resistance and possible
strategies to overcome this by combinatorial treatment. In MM, cIAP2 is part of
the gene signature of aberrant NF-κB signaling and is heterogeneously expressed
amongst MM patients. In cIAP2 overexpressing cells a decreased sensitivity to the
proteasome inhibitors bortezomib, MG132 and carfilzomib was observed. Gene
expression analysis revealed that 440 genes were differentially expressed due to
cIAP2 overexpression. Importantly, the data imply that cIAPs are rational targets
for combinatorial treatment in the population of MM with deleted/mutated TRAF3.
Indeed, we found that treatment with the IAP inhibitor AT-406 enhanced the antiMM effect of bortezomib in the investigated cell lines. Taken together, our results
show that cIAP2 is an important factor mediating bortezomib resistance in MM cells
harboring TRAF3 deletion/mutation and therefore should be considered as a target
for combinatorial treatment.

INTRODUCTION

on possible underlying mechanisms for resistance are
highly likely to benefit the development of yet novel and
improved therapies to MM. A possible explanation for
the failure to cure MM is the emergence of drug resistant
clones. Different mechanisms have been suggested to lead
to bortezomib resistance e.g. mutations and overexpression
of the proteasome subunit PSMB5 [6], alterations in genes
associated with stress response such as heat shock proteins
[7], and up-regulation of cell survival pathways such as
the IGF-1/IGF-1R axis [8].
Important mechanisms underlying insensitivity

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a post-germinal
center B-cell tumor characterized by an accumulation of
malignant monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow.
It is the second most prevalent hematological malignancy
and accounts for approximately 1% of all cancers. The
increased understanding of the biology of MM has led
to the current improvements of treatment, such as the
proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, prolonging survival
greatly for MM patients [1-5] Thus, novel insights

to therapy are genetic alterations in major key signaling
pathways. In MM, a constitutive NF-κB activation, as
demonstrated by an activated gene signature promotes
tumor cell survival and proliferation [9-11]. cIAP2, a
member of the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP) is part
of this gene signature. IAPs are frequently found altered
in human malignancies, including hematological tumors,
leading to aberrant apoptosis-signaling pathways. These
alterations are often associated with chemoresistance,
disease progression and poor patient prognosis [1214]. Eight human homologues of IAPs have so far been
identified and all contain one to three baculovirus IAP
repeat (BIR) motifs [15] that allow them to bind to and
inhibit caspases. XIAP (X-chromosome linked IAP) is
best characterized and a prominent inhibitor of caspase
activation [14, 16]. However, not all homologues of the
IAP family have been convincingly shown to exert the
anti-apoptotic effect by direct binding and sequestering of
caspase activity [17].
The IAP homologues are also important regulators
of the NF-κB pathway. The NF-κB transcription factor
family consist of five subunits (p50/NF-κB1, p52/
NF-κB2, p65, c-Rel and RelB) which dimerize into
hetero- and homo-dimeric complexes and are held in
the cytoplasm by the inhibitors of NF-κBs (IκBs) [18].
There are two distinct NF-κB activation pathways, the
canonical and the non-canonical NF-κB pathway [19,
20]. In the canonical pathway the inhibitor of IκB kinase
β (IKKβ) phosphorylates the IκBs leading to proteasomal
degradation, and accumulation of p50/p65 and c-rel/
p65 in the nucleus [9, 21, 22]. In the non-canonical
pathway IKKα is activated by NF-κB inducing kinase
(NIK). The activated IKKα phosphorylates NF-κB2 and
proteasomal removal of an inhibitory C-terminal IκB-δ
domain, resulting in accumulation of p52/RelB in the
nucleus [23]. cIAP1/cIAP2 play an important role in both
the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathway. In the
canonical pathway cIAP1/2 are positive regulators of
TNFα mediated activation, while in the non-canonical NFκB pathway, cIAP1/2, TRAF2 and TRAF3 have repressive

roles by promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of
NIK [14]. Genetic lesions in the non-canonical pathway
leading to uncontrolled NF-κB activation appear in
approximately 20% of MM patients [9, 14, 24]. Among
these, the loss of functional TRAF3 is the most common
gene deleted/mutated [9]. Importantly, MM harboring
inactivated TRAF3 and a hyperactivated NF-κB signature
e.g. high expression of genes that are involved in NFκB signaling, are associated to initial good response to
proteasome inhibitors [24, 25]. In this study we aimed at
exploring the role of cIAP2 in emerging drug resistance
in MM cells. We focused on the human MM cell lines
harboring TRAF3 deletion/mutation (LP-1 and ANBL6). LP-1 lack the entire MATH domain that is crucial for
interaction with NIK and ANBL-6 has a mutation causing
production of a protein with a disrupted MATH domain
[9].
Since IAPs can block apoptosis-signaling pathways,
promote survival and are likely candidates for drug
resistance, the IAP proteins are currently considered
as promising molecular targets for therapy [26]. In this
paper, we have identified an important role of cIAP2
as a regulator of sensitivity of MM cells to proteasome
inhibitors in the subgroup with TRAF3 mutation/deletion.
Moreover, the IAP inhibitor AT-406 sensitized the
MM cells to bortezomib treatment, thereby providing a
rationale for a potential therapeutic use of the IAP inhibitor
AT-406 in combination with proteasome inhibitors.

RESULTS
Overexpressing cIAP2 in TRAF3 deleted/mutated
MM cell lines leads to drug tolerance selectively
towards proteasome inhibitors
The expression of cIAP1 and cIAP2 was analyzed
in a cohort of MM patients and in bone marrow plasma
cells from healthy donors, MGUS and smoldering patients

(Figure 1). For cIAP2 no significant differences were
observed between the groups, while cIAP1 expression was
increased in MM patients compared to normal and MGUS
plasma cells. Furthermore, we observed that the level

of cIAP2 expression was heterogeneous amongst MM
patients while cIAP1 is more homogeneously expressed.
The basal cIAP2 expression was similar in LP-1 and
ANBL-6, as analyzed by qRT-PCR (Supplementary Figure

lentiviral transduction using pIRES2-cIAP2-eGFP vector
(LP-1-cIAP2-eGFP) and pIRES2-eGFP vector (control).
The increase in cIAP2 expression was verified both on
mRNA and protein level (Supplementary Figure 3). To
evaluate whether cIAP2 overexpression had an effect
on drug resistance the cells were exposed to a panel of
different drugs including the mTOR inhibitor (rapamycin),
all-trans retinoic acid (atra), 17-AAG/geldanamycin
(data not shown), Parthenolide, Melphalan, the histone
deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid
(SAHA), (Supplementary Figure 4) and three proteasome
inhibitors. The LP-1-cIAP2-eGFP cells showed a selective
tolerance to proteasome inhibitors, bortezomib (Figure
2A), MG132 (Figure 2B) or carfilzomib (Figure 2C) as
compared to control.
To confirm these results we transduced the ANBL-

6 cell line with the same vectors and treated them
with bortezomib (Figure 2D), MG132 (Figure 2E) or
carfilzomib (Figure 2F). Similarly to the results using the
LP-1 cell line, we found that ANBL-6-cIAP2-eGFP cells
were more tolerant to proteasome inhibitors compared to
ANBL-6-eGFP (control).

cIAP2 binds to caspases and its overexpression
reduces caspase activation
We first determined the effect on apoptosis of
bortezomib treatment in the LP-1-cIAP2-eGFP cells. We
found a significantly lower amount of apoptotic cells in
the LP-1-cIAP2-eGFP cells as compared to control (Figure
3A).
Next, the effect of cIAP2 overexpression on caspase

activation was examined. The results show reduced
activation of caspase-3, -8 and -9 in the LP-1-cIAP2-eGFP
cells as compared to control when treated with bortezomib
(Figure 3B-3D). The proximity ligation assay (PLA),
enables the analysis of direct protein-protein binding and

was used to determine the interaction of cIAP2 to caspases
at cellular level. An increased number of interactions
between cIAP2 and caspases upon bortezomib treatment
in the LP-1-cIAP2-eGFP was observed, illustrated as
green dots (PLA signals) (Figure 4A, 4C and 4E). The

cIAP2 stabilizes the p105/p50 complex in the
canonical NF-κB pathway

quantification of the PLA signals between caspase-3 and
cIAP2 demonstrated that this interaction significantly
increased in LP-1-cIAP2-eGFP cells when treated with
bortezomib (Figure 4Ai, 4Aii and 4B) while for the control
no significant change was seen (Figure 4Aiii, 4Aiiii and
4B). The interaction between cIAP2 and caspase-8 was
also significantly increased in the LP-1-cIAP2-eGFP cells
when treated with bortezomib (Figure 4Ci, 4Cii and 4D)
but not in the control (Figure 4Ciii, 4Ciiii and 4D). In
contrast, the interactions between cIAP2 and caspase-9
was neither significantly increased in the LP-1-cIAP2eGFP cells (Figure 4Ei, 4Eii and 4F) nor in control cells
(Figure 4Eiii, 4Eiiii and 4F) upon bortezomib treatment.

Since cIAP2 is an important regulator of the NF-κB
pathway, subcellular localization and levels of canonical
(p105, p50, p65) and non-canonical pathway proteins
(p100, p52) was analyzed by western blot in nuclear and
cytoplasmic extracts from LP-1-cIAP2-eGFP and control
cells treated with bortezomib. We found elevated levels of
p105 and p50 in the nuclear (Figure 5A) and cytoplasmic
(Figure 5B) fractions in the LP-1-cIAP2-eGFP cells when
treated with bortezomib compared to control. No alteration
or subcellular localization of the non-canonical pathway
proteins, p100 and p52 was seen in the LP-1-cIAP2eGFP or in the control cells when treated with bortezomib
(Figure 5C-5D).

Figure 5: cIAP2 affects the canonical NF-κB pathway through stabilization of p105 and p50. LP-1-cIAP2-eGFP and

Pharmacological inhibition of IAPs leads to an
increased sensitivity to bortezomib

function of cIAPs is still poorly understood [28]. In human
MM cell lines XIAP and cIAP1 are expressed in rather
similar levels, while cIAP2 is variably expressed [28].
This is in accordance with our analysis of cIAP1/cIAP2
expression in a cohort of 345 MM patients. Taken together,
the IAPs could have a possible role in drug resistance and
may therefore constitute a new and interesting therapeutic
target in MM. In this study, we explored the possible role
of cIAP2 in drug resistance. Overexpressing cIAP2 in
TRAF3 deleted/mutated cell lines, LP-1 and ANBL-6,
did not lead to a general drug resistance but, a decreased
sensitivity to the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib,
MG132 and carfilzomib.
XIAP has been described to inhibit caspase-3, -7
and -9 via its BIR2 and BIR3 domain and is therefore
considered mediating the anti-apoptotic effect via this
mechanism [16]. The results from the PLA studies suggest
that cIAP2 indeed directly binds to caspase-3, -8 and -9.
Interestingly, after treatment with bortezomib a significant
increase of cIAP2 bound to caspase-3 and caspase-8 was
found in the cIAP2 overexpressing cells compared to
control. However, cIAPs have previously been reported to
exhibit less potential to inhibit caspases due to the lack of
interacting surfaces required for protease inhibition [17].
cIAPs may also obstruct apoptosis by targeting caspases
for proteasomal degradation via their RING domain [29]
and thus rather act primary as E3 ligases. Since a selective
decrease in sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors was
observed, a general caspase sequestering by the cIAP2
may not alone be a likely explanation. cIAP2 may also
exert its anti-apoptotic effects via the tumor necrosis factor
pathway, where they may modulate both the canonical and
the non-canonical NF-κB pathway by ubiquitinating the
receptor-interacting protein (RIP) and the TNF receptorassociated factor (TRAF). In the absence of cIAPs, RIP1
forms a complex with the death receptor complex and
activates the extrinsic pathway and caspase-8 [30, 31].
This pathway was not the subject for examination in
this study, however, we did observe an increase in active
caspase-8 in the control compared to the LP-1-cIAP2eGFP cells.
The NF-κB pathway stimulates growth and survival
in MM cells [10] and the cIAPs have an important role
in regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway by positive
regulation of the canonical signaling and a repressive
role in the non-canonical activation [27]. To determine
the relative contribution of the two pathways upon cIAP2
overexpression and proteasome inhibition, we investigated
the nuclear translocation of the NF-κB complexes. We
demonstrated that cIAP2 overexpression leads to an
increase in p105/p50 levels in nuclear and cytoplasmic
extracts upon bortezomib treatment suggesting the
activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway. Since the LP-1
cell line has a TRAF3 deletion/mutation and no detectable
NIK, cIAP2 overexpression may not have impact on the
non-canonical NF-κB pathway. We observed no alterations

The above results indicate that cIAP2 may constitute
an important potential therapeutic target for combinatorial
use with proteasome inhibitors. To investigate potential of
this combination in MM, the IAP antagonist AT-406 which
binds to cIAP1, cIAP2 and XIAP with high affinities was
used. The LP-1 and ANBL-6 cells were pre-treated with
AT-406 (1 and 10µM) for 1, 4, 24 and 48 hours, since
the proteasome is needed for the degradation of cIAPs,
followed by bortezomib treatment. A down-regulation of
the expression of the cIAP1 and cIAP2 protein was found
with the most pronounced effect after 4 hours in both
cell lines (Figure 7A). Therefore, the LP-1 and ANBL-6
cells were pre-treated for 4 hours with 1 and 10µM AT406 followed by bortezomib treatment for 24 hours. This
resulted in a significant reduction in viability as compared
to treatment with bortezomib alone (Figure 7B-7C). This
was confirmed in the MM cell line (U266), harboring a
TRAF3 mutation, and in the MM cell line (JJN3), with
no TRAF3 mutation, but a NIK mutation, both cell lines
dependent on the canonical pathway. The RPMI 8226 also
harbors a TRAF3 mutation, although less dependent on the
canonical pathway. This is also reflected by no significant
effects of the combination of bortezomib and AT406 in
this cell line. The OPM-2 cell line that does not harbor a
TRAF3 mutation is sensitive to bortezomib but does not
show enhanced apoptosis when combined with AT-406
(Supplementary Figure 6). To further confirm these results
we examined the effect of the combination on apoptosis
and found a significantly higher amount of apoptotic
cells when combining AT-406 with either bortezomib
(Figure 7D-7E) or the more novel proteasome inhibitor
carfilzomib (Supplementary Figure 7) compared to single
treatments.

DISCUSSION
During the last decade the survival in MM patients
has significantly improved due to the introduction
of novel agents (e.g. bortezomib, thalidomide and
lenalidomide) but despite these improvements, MM is
still regarded incurable mainly due to the development
of resistance. During disease progression drug resistant
and more aggressive clones emerge which calls for the
identification of new battery of targeted drugs that may
be used in combination with the currently used ones. An
interesting group of proteins that are often overexpressed
in cancer are the members of the IAP protein family. The
IAP proteins are a heterogeneous group of anti-apoptotic
molecules overexpressed in several hematological
malignancies [27] and associated with chemoresistance,
disease progression and poor prognosis [12, 13]. Although
an anti-apoptotic role for XIAP is well recognized, the

in the subcellular localization on p100/p52 indicating that
cIAP2 overexpression did not affect the non-canonical
pathway.
Gene expression analysis revealed increased
expression of genes that may constitute nodes for a
large number of direct interacting partners upon cIAP2
overexpression. Among these we found the IGF1 and
CD44 to be up-regulated. While FAS, BCL2L1 and
IRF1, all target genes of the NF-κB pathway and ICAM1,
CALM3, FSCN1, RUNX1, PROS1 and STAT1 were all
significantly down-regulated in the cIAP2 overexpressing
cells.
NF-κB transcription factors are regulators of
immune inflammatory response but are also involved in
the control of apoptosis and cell proliferation in many
types of cancer including MM [32]. Mutations in the
NF-κB pathway may lead to overactivation of positive
regulators or loss of negative regulators [9] resulting in
a constitutive or overactivated NF-κB signaling leading
to increased survival. In this study we found 12 target
genes of NF-κB pathway to be down-regulated. To date,
the complete function of all these genes are not known,
however, several of them have been reported to have a
tumor-suppressor role or contribute to apoptosis. ASS1
[33] and IRF1 [34] have been reported to act as tumorsuppressors. IL1RN inhibits PGE2, IL-6 production and
MM cell growth [35], FTH1 is a favorable prognostic
protein but is not really known to contribute to antitumor response [36] and the death receptor FAS induces
apoptosis in a large number of cell types [37]. Gene
expression analysis did not reveal regulation of the
proteasome subunit β5 but interestingly we found an upregulation of IGF-1 in the LP-1-cIAP2-eGFP cells that
persisted upon treatment whereas in the control cells IGF1 expression decreased after bortezomib treatment. IGF1 is an important growth factor in MM and contributes
to MM pathobiology. Overexpression of IGF-1 and its
receptor IGF-1R correlates with disease progression and
poor patient prognosis and has been linked to bortezomib
resistance [8, 38-42].
Since overexpression of cIAP2 contributes to
bortezomib resistance in cell lines that have TRAF3
mutation/deletion inhibition of cIAP2 by physiological
or pharmacological interventions may be an attractive
strategy to increase the sensitivity to bortezomib. The IAP
antagonist AT-406 has been demonstrated to bind to IAPs
with high affinities [43]. Due to the redundant function
of the IAPs it has been shown that it is crucial to downregulate all IAPs simultaneously to induce apoptosis [28].
Binding of AT-406 prevents binding of XIAP to caspases
while binding of AT-406 to cIAP1/2 stimulates autoubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation
of cIAPs [43]. Since the proteasome is needed for the
degradation of cIAPs, MM cells were pretreated with
AT-406 followed with proteasome inhibition. A potent
down-regulation of cIAP1 and cIAP2 were found in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

both cell lines already after 1 hour of treatment, cIAP1
was consistently down-regulated during all time points
while cIAP2 reached baseline levels again after 24hours.
In this study we could observe that AT-406 alone at a
concentration of 10µM has a small but significant effect
on the viability of MM cells and an enhanced sensitivity
to bortezomib was found when the MM cells were pretreated with AT-406. Currently, IAP inhibition is under
extensive investigation in a wide variety of cancers. AT406 has an in vitro anti-tumor effect in breast and ovarian
cancer but has a minimal toxicity in normal-like human
breast epithelial cells and primary human normal prostate
epithelial cells [43]. This was also true for cells highly
relevant to the MM microenvironment such as bone
marrow stromal cells isolated from 5T33MM diseased
mice, and the bone marrow endothelial cell line STR10 (data not shown). Moreover, AT-406 is very potent
inducing apoptosis in xenograft model of breast cancer
and capable of complete inhibition of tumor growth [43,
44]. In preclinical xenograft models of plasmacytoma,
Smac mimetics have been shown to inhibit human MM
cell growth in vivo [45]. This model does not, however,
examine the impact of the bone marrow microenvironment
on tumor growth. Further studies in relevant syngeneic
models of MM are necessary to understand the role of
IAP antagonists within the tumor milieu in MM. AT406 is currently in Phase I trial as a single treatment
for solid tumors and lymphomas, and in trials using the
combination with daunorubicin and cytarabine in acute
myeloid leukemia (AML) [27]. As IAPs have a diverse
and complex function in several processes including
apoptosis, necroptosis and the NF-κB pathway, and MM
patients show a pronounced genetic heterogeneity as
well as in drug response, further studies are needed to
elucidate the function of IAPs in MM. From our current
study, we conclude that in TRAF3 mutated MM cells,
cIAP2 expression is an important factor in resistance
to proteasome inhibition. This resistance is caused by a
decrease of cleaved caspases upon treatment, activation
of the canonical NF-κB pathway, and dysregulation of
genes acting as direct interaction hubs, including downregulated NF-κB target genes with known anti-tumor
activity. Furthermore, approximately 20% of the MM
patients harbor genetic lesions in genes of the NF-κB
pathway leading to uncontrolled NF-κB activation, loss of
functional TRAF3 being the most common gene deleted/
mutated [9, 24]. We show that inhibition of IAPs could
increase the sensitivity to bortezomib, thus suggesting that
a combination of IAP antagonists with bortezomib would
be beneficial for MM patients harboring TRAF3 mutations
leading to hyperactivation of the NF-κB pathway and
more dependency on the canonical pathway.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

17-AAG/geldanamycin and suberoylanilide hydroxamic
acid (SAHA) (Biovision, Milpitas, USA) were dissolved
in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; final concentration
<0.01%) and aliquots were stored at -20°C.

Analysis of cIAP1 and cIAP2 gene expression in
MM patients

RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and quantitative
real-time PCR

Gene expression levels were analyzed in publically
available datasets of pre-treatment bone marrow aspirates
from 414 MM patients and bone marrow plasma cells
from healthy donors (n = 22), MGUS (n = 44), and
Smoldering Myeloma (n = 12) from the University of
Arkansas for Medical Sciences (Little Rock, USA) [46].
These data can be accessed at the online Gene Expression
Omnibus (GSE4581 and GSE5900). Normalization of
gene expression data was performed using the MAS5
algorithm and analyzed by the bioinformatics Platform
Genomicscape (http://genomicscape.com/) [47]

Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) and reverse transcription using
random primers (Invitrogen) was performed on 2µg
total RNA using SuperScript™ III reverse transcriptase
(Invitrogen) both according to manufacturer’s instructions.
cDNA was analyzed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR
using Platinum® SYBR®Green pPCR Supermix UDG
with Rox (Invitrogen) and 0.3mM of cIAP2 forward
primer 5’-gtg tta gac tta ctc aat gca gaa g-3’ and 0.3mM of
reverse primer 5’-cca gga ttg gaa tta cac aag tc-3’. The run
and analysis were performed using Mx3005P (Stratagene).

Cell lines

Drug sensitivity of transduced cells

Human MM cell lines LP-1 [48] (DSMZ) and
ANBL-6 (a kind gift from Prof Jelinek), all authenticated
by STR analysis, were maintained in RPMI-1640
(Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany),
glutamine (2mM) and antibiotics (penicillin 100U/mL and
streptomycin 50g/mL) (Lonza) at 37°C in a humidified
5% CO2 in-air atmosphere. The ANBL-6 cell line was
supplemented with 2ng/ml IL-6 (R&D systems, Abingdon,
UK).

The viability of the transduced cells upon treatment
was assessed with the Resazurin assay using AlamarBlue
(Sigma-Aldrich) as previous described [49].
Apoptosis was quantified by staining with annexinVAlexa Fluor 647 and Propidium Iodide (PI) (Invitrogen).
Cells were analyzed with FACSCalibur flow cytometer
(BD Biosciences) using FACSDiva software according to
manufacturer’s instructions.

Combination effect of IAP inhibitor AT-406 with
bortezomib

Lentiviral production and stable transduction
HEK293T cells were co-transfected with the pMD.G
envelope plasmid, the pCMV packing plasmid and the
transfer plasmid pIRES2 expressing cIAP2 and eGFP or
only eGFP (control). Lentiviruses were produced using
the lipofectamin protocol according to manufacturer’s
instructions (Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, USA). After 48
and 72 hours the supernatant containing the lentiviruses
was harvested and concentrated by ultracentrifugation.
The eGFP expression of transduced cells was determined
using the FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences,
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and cells were sorted using the
AriaIII (BD Biosciences). FACSDiva software was used
for analysis.

LP-1(wt) and ANBL-6(wt) cells were treated for 4
hours with 1 or 10µM of AT-406 followed by bortezomib
treatment (5 or 10nM). After 24 hours the viability was
measured with the CellTiter-Glo Luminiscent Viability
assay (Promega, Leiden, The Netherlands) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. The relative amount of viable
cells was expressed as percentage of untreated cells.
Apoptosis was measured with Annexin V-FITC and
7-AAD (BD Biosciences) followed by flow cytometric
analysis (FACS Canto and Diva software, BD Biosciences)
according to manufacturer’s instructions.

Western blot analysis

Reagents

Cells were harvested, lysed, and protein extracts
were blotted as previously described[50]. Primary
antibodies were used against caspase-3, caspase-8,
caspase-9, cIAP2 (Cell Signaling, Leiden, The
Netherlands), cIAP1 (R&D systems) p105, p50, p100, p52
and β-actin (Santa Cruz, Heidelberg, Germany). β-actin

Bortezomib (Selleckchem, Munich, Germany),

student t-test was used. For all other experiments 2-way
ANOVA or Mann-Whitney U-test were used to calculate
the significance. A p-value < 0.05 was considered as
significant.

Proximity ligation assay
Cells were treated with bortezomib (20nM)
for 6 and 24 hours. Approximately, 50.000-100.000
cells were spun on glass slides, fixed in 4% PFA and
permeabilized in EtOH 70% at 4°C. Samples were
assessed as previously described [51]. The short and the
long circularization oligonucleotide and the fluorophore
labelled oligonucleotide are listed in (Supplementary Table
1). Raw images were used for quantification of signals per
cell in CellProfiler version one (www.cellprofiler.org).

Gene expression array
Cells were treated with 10nM bortezomib for 6
and 24 hours. Total RNA isolation was performed using
illustra RNAspin mini RNA isolation kit (GE Healthcare,
Uppsala, Sweden) according to manufacturer’s protocol.
Gene expression microarrays were performed using
Agilent Sure Print G3 Human gene expression 8x60K
v2 microarray. The labeling was done according to
manufacturer’s protocol. Two biological replicates
were used for microarray analysis. In the LP-1-cIAP2eGFP cells, a lower expression of cIAP2 (BIRC3) was
found compared to the control in the array. This is due
to the design of the probe on the array to the 3 prime
UTR detecting only the endogenous cIAP2. RT-qPCR
analysis was used to verify that the LP-cIAP2-eGFP cells
overexpress the cIAP2 mRNA as compared to control
(Supplementary Figure 1). http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.

The arrays were Quantile normalized using
GeneSpring12.6.1. 3-way ANOVA with a FDR correction
using Benjamini-Hochberg was used to find differentially
regulated genes in the untreated LP-1-cIAP2-eGFP
compared to untreated control using three parameters
i.e. time, treatment and cIAP2 expression. The p-value <
0.001 and a fold change >2-fold were used as a cutoff for
selecting differentially regulated genes. A moderated t-test
was used to evaluate the effect on gene expression as a
result of cIAP2 overexpression with a p-value of 0.005
and >2-fold cutoff. The hierarchical clustering was done
for >2-fold differentially regulated genes using Euclidian
distance and average linking rule. Further bioinformatics
analysis was performed using genes selected to be
differently regulated in the LP-1-cIAP2-eGFP versus
control. To compare cIAP expression levels between
