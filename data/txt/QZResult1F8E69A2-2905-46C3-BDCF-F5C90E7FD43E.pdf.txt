BACKGROUND: Cetuximab in combination with docetaxel was examined in chemotherapy-refractory/resistant patients with advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to determine response rate, survival,
safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK). METHODS: Patients had evidence of epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) expression (1 þ) and tumor progression during or disease recurrence within 3 months after chemotherapy. Cetuximab was administered weekly (400 mg/m2 initial; 250 mg/m2 thereafter). Docetaxel was
administered every 3 weeks (75 mg/m2). A response in 3 of the first 21 patients was required to continue
accrual to the target sample size of 50 patients. RESULTS: Confirmed responses included 1 complete
response (1.8%), 10 partial responses (18.2%), and 20 with stable disease (36.4%). The response rate was
20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.4% to 33.0%) and median time to disease progression was 104 days.
There were no differences in PK parameters of docetaxel alone or with cetuximab. The most common
grade 3 of 4 adverse events were leukopenia (27.3%) and acne (21.8%). Four patients (7.3%) discontinued
due to allergic reaction. The median overall survival (OS) was 7.5 months with a 1-year survival of 35%.
CONCLUSIONS: Cetuximab in combination with docetaxel was well tolerated. The response rate supports

1-year survival rate of 11%.4 The role of salvage therapy
after first-line treatment of NSCLC was first established
by Fossella et al who compared docetaxel 100 and
75 mg/m2 with a control regimen of vinorelbine or ifosamide (overall response, 10.8% and 6.7% vs .8%).5 Docetaxel, when compared with best supportive care, increased
response rates (time to progression, 10.6 vs 6.7 weeks),
overall survival (OS; median survival, 7.0 vs 4.6 months),
and quality of life in the randomized phase 3 study by
Shepherd et al,4 and it was the first cytotoxic agent
approved in this setting. Since then, other treatment
options have become available for previously treated
NSCLC patients including pemetrexed (similar efficacy
results when compared with docetaxel)6 and erlotinib
(response rate vs placebo, 8.9% vs <1%; progression-free
survival, 2.2 vs 1.8 months, hazard ratio [HR] ¼ .61; OS,
6.7 vs 4.7 months, HR ¼ .70; P < .001 for all).7 These
salvage lung studies all reported response rates of less than
10% and 1-year survivals of approximately 30%.
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has
become a promising target for anti-cancer therapy, specifically lung cancers, which frequently exhibit EGFR overexpression.8-10 EGFR targeted therapies lead to inhibition
of cell cycle progression, induction of apoptosis, and
impairment of tumor growth.11
Cetuximab is a recombinant DNA-derived, chimerized monoclonal antibody that blocks the binding of EGF
or TGF-a to the receptor. Cetuximab inhibits ligandinduced receptor phosphorylation and stimulates receptor
internalization. It may also trigger antibody-dependent
cellular cytotoxicity. Numerous studies have demonstrated that cetuximab monotherapy effectively inhibits
proliferation of EGFR-positive tumor cells in vitro and
tumor growth in xenograft models.12-16 Furthermore, it
has been shown to increase sensitivity to chemotherapy in
vitro17 and to reverse resistance to chemotherapy, both in
preclinical models18 and in a randomized phase 3 study of
patients with advanced colorectal cancer.19 Based on the
tolerability of cetuximab and the efficacy of docetaxel as
second-line therapy, this trial was conducted to investigate
the efficacy and tolerability of the combination in patients
with NSCLC for whom front-line chemotherapy has
failed. A patient population with chemotherapy refractory
or resistant disease (and thus expected to have a poor outcome to salvage cytotoxic treatment alone) was specifically
selected for this study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
We conducted a multicenter, open-label, nonrandomized
Phase 2 trial for patients with recurrent or progressive
NSCLC. The trial opened in May 2001 and closed in
May 2006. In all, 55 patients were entered from 3 participating institutions in the United States. The primary
objective was to determine the response rate of cetuximab
in combination with docetaxel in patients with recurrent
or progressive NSCLC within 3 months of receiving a
cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen. Secondary objectives
were to assess the safety profile of the cetuximab/docetaxel
combination, determine the duration of response and
overall survival, and evaluate the effects of cetuximab on
the PK of docetaxel.
Patient Eligibility
Patient eligibility requirements were as follows: histologically or pathologically proven recurrent or progressive
NSCLC; unidimensionally measurable NSCLC; Karnofsky performance score (KPS) 60; progressive disease
within 3 months after discontinuing 1 cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen; signed informed consent; adequate
hematologic, hepatic, and renal function; immunohistochemical evidence of EGFR expression (1 þ ); and
be 18 years of age. EGFR expression was determined by
a central laboratory (Impath Labs) and was considered
1 þ if 10% of tumor cells presented any degree of
staining. Exclusion criteria were as follows: pregnancy or
lactation; prior anti-EGFR antibody therapy or small
molecule therapy; prior docetaxel therapy; prior chemotherapy or major thoracic or abdominal surgery within 30
days before the first infusion of cetuximab; wide field radiation therapy within 4 weeks before the first infusion of
cetuximab; history of uncontrolled angina, arrhythmias,
or congestive heart failure; uncontrolled seizure disorder,
active neurological disease or grade 2 neuropathy; and
any investigational agent within 30 days of study entry.
This study was conducted in accordance with current good clinical practices (GCPs) and International
Conference on Harmonization (ICH) recommendations,
as well as all applicable local, state, and federal regulations
and guidelines regarding the conduct of clinical trials. In
addition, this study was conducted in accordance with the

Treatment
Enrolled patients received cetuximab weekly in combination with docetaxel every 3 weeks. Cetuximab was manufactured and supplied by ImClone Systems Incorporated
(Branchburg, NJ), and was administered by intravenous
(IV) infusion at an initial dose of 400 mg/m2 (over
120 minutes) followed by weekly maintenance doses of
250 mg/m2 (over 60 minutes). Cetuximab premedication
comprised diphenhydramine hydrochloride 50 mg IV.
Docetaxel (75 mg/m2) was given as a 1-hour IV infusion
repeated every 21 days. Docetaxel premedication comprised corticosteroids for 3 days (starting 1 day before
docetaxel infusion) and antiemetics per each institution’s
protocol. Cetuximab was administered on Days 1, 8, and
15 of each treatment cycle. Docetaxel was given 1 hour
after the completion of the cetuximab infusion on Day 1 of
each treatment cycle. For patients undergoing docetaxel PK
studies only for cycle 1, cetuximab was started on Day 2.
Cetuximab was permanently discontinued if the
patient’s treatment was delayed for more than 2 consecutive weeks because of grade 3 skin reactions or if grade 3
skin reaction occurred a fourth time, but there was no
change in the cetuximab weekly schedule for docetaxelrelated toxicity. Two cetuximab dose reductions (to 200
and 150 mg/m2/week) were allowed for repeated grade 3
skin toxicities. A docetaxel dose reduction of 25% was
permitted in the case of docetaxel-related adverse events
(AEs), intercurrent illnesses, or toxicities. However, stable
or responding patients who developed intolerable neurotoxicity or nephrotoxicity were able to continue docetaxel
therapy at a further reduced dose. Patients that discontinued docetaxel due to AEs were allowed to continue cetuximab therapy. Patients continued treatment until disease
progression, protocol noncompliance, intolerable toxicity, or an intercurrent illness that mandated interruption

of cetuximab therapy for more than 2 consecutive
infusions.

Efficacy
Responses were defined by Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumors (RECIST).20 Imaging studies were
obtained at baseline and at 6-week intervals. Disease control was defined as the best tumor response of complete
response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease
(SD) that was confirmed and sustained for 4 weeks or longer. Duration of response was defined as the time from the
initial response during combination therapy to progression
of disease or death. Progression-free survival and median
OS were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.

Safety and Tolerability
All patients receiving at least 1 dose of cetuximab were
evaluated for safety analysis. Systemic and local treatment-emergent AEs were graded using the established
National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria
(NCI-CTC), Version 2.0. Routine clinical and laboratory
assessments were performed.

Pharmacokinetic Studies
For the determination of docetaxel concentration, 5-mL
blood samples were collected from peripheral IV site into
heparin-containing Vacutainer at the following time
points: Predose, 55 minutes, 1.25, 1.5, 2.5, 6.5, and 24
hours after start of docetaxel infusion on cycle 1, Day 1
(docetaxel alone; cetuximab started on Day 2 for patients
undergoing PK studies) and cycle 2 (docetaxel in combination with cetuximab). After collection, samples were centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 minutes at 5 C. Plasma was
placed into a labeled cryovial and frozen at –70 C until
analysis. Docetaxel concentrations were quantified using a
validated reverse phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay.21 The dynamic range for the assay was
from 50 to 10,000 ng/mL with an intra-and inter-day
standard deviation of <15%. Analytical system comprised
Alliance HPLC system with a Waters 2487 tunable dual
channel UV/Vis absorbance detector (Waters Corp, Milford, Mass). A derived channel at 230 nm was extracted to
create chromatograms for peak analysis. The docetaxel
1715

peak was positively identified from other peaks using ultraviolet (UV) absorbance spectrum and retention time. PK
parameters for docetaxel were estimated using standard
noncompartmental method (WinNonlin, version 3.1;
Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, Calif). To assess
if cetuximab had an effect on the PK of docetaxel, with
each patient serving as their own control, the parameters
between cycle 1 (docetaxel alone) and cycle 2 (docetaxel in
combination with cetuximab) were compared using the
Student t test for paired data, with a priori level of significance of P ¼ .05. Cetuximab concentration in serum was
measured using a validated Biacore-based assay.22

Statistical Considerations
Simon’s optimal 2-stage design,23 which allowed for early
stopping for ineffectiveness, was implemented. It was
expected the new regimen would have a targeted response
rate of 25%. With a probability of 0.1 of accepting a
response rate of 10% (ineffective regimen) or rejecting a
response rate 25% (effective regimen), 3 patients were
required to have a response among the first 21 patients
treated so as to allow accrual to continue until the target
total sample size of 50 patients was reached. At the end of
the study, the new regimen would be rejected if the response
rate was 14% (7 of 50) and would be accepted otherwise.

RESULTS
Patients
Fifty-five patients were enrolled: o47 were evaluable for
efficacy and 55 were evaluable for safety. All 55 patients
were included in the denominator for the intent-to-treat
analysis of response. Of the 8 patients who were not evaluable for tumor response, 1 patient withdrew due to disease
progression, 3 patients died (2 due to disease complications and 1 due to an intercurrent illness), and 4 patients
discontinued the study due to AEs before the first tumor
assessment. Baseline characteristics of all enrolled patients
are summarized in Table 1.

Exposure
Overall, 55 patients received a median of 11 (range 1 to

1 patient to 56 mg/m2). Treatment delays of cetuximab or
docetaxel occurred in 37 (67%) and 18 patients (33%),
respectively. Reasons for treatment discontinuation were
disease progression (41 patients, 75%), AEs (8 patients,

56.4%. For the patients who responded (those with an
objective response of CR or PR), the median duration of
response was 225 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 66,
1684 þ days). Data are also presented in Table 3 based on
47 patients excluding the 8 nonevaluable patients. In this
analysis, the objective response rate was 23.4% and the
disease control rate was 66%.
The median OS was 7.5 months (95% CI, 6.7 to
12 months) with a 1-year survival of 35% (Fig. 1). The
median progression-free survival was 2.7 months (95%
CI, 1.8 to 4.4 months). A subset analysis that correlates
grade of rash and survival was performed. Patients with
grade 3 rash had a median survival of 10.33 months,
whereas the median survival of patients with grade 1-2
rash and no rash was 7.26 and 2.0 months, respectively.
The Cox regression model was used to test whether
patients with rash had a longer OS compared with
patients without a rash. Patients with a grade 3 rash experienced a significantly longer OS compared with patients
without rash (P ¼ .0066). No correlation was observed
between survival and grade of immunohistochemistry

grade 3 and 4 AEs included leukopenia (23.6%), acne
(21.8%), asthenia (20.0%), dyspnea (18.2%), and pneumonia (12.7%) (Table 4).

Pharmacokinetics
From the 17 patients who consented to the optional blood
collection for PK analysis, a summary of the peak and
trough concentrations of cetuximab are depicted in Figure
2. After the first cycle of cetuximab, the mean trough concentration ranged from 67 þ 32 mg/mL to 165 þ 84 mg/
mL and the 1-hour peak cetuximab concentrations ranged
from 243 þ 62 mg/mL to 385 þ 176 mg/mL. For the
determination of PK of docetaxel, 8 patients had adequate
blood sampling for PK modeling in both cycles 1 (docetaxel alone) and 2 (docetaxel and cetuximab). The summary PK parameters are presented in Table 5. There were
no differences in the PK parameters of docetaxel either
alone or in combination with cetuximab (P > .05); in
addition, these values are within ranges reported by other
investigators using docetaxel as a single-agent dosing regimen.24-26

The landscape in NSCLC salvage therapy continues to be
an evolving field. Current FDA-approved agents include
docetaxel, pemetrexed, and erlotinib with reported
response rates of less than 10% and median survivals of 5

to 8 months.4,6,7 This multicenter phase 2 study of combination cetuximab and docetaxel demonstrates activity
in patients with chemotherapy refractory advanced
NSCLC. The primary endpoint of response rate (20%)
and disease control rate (56%) in the evaluable population
compares favorably with historical controls in the secondline setting. However, this study targeted a chemotherapy
refractory or resistant population, defined as patients who
had disease progression while on chemotherapy or within
3 months of completing prior therapy, which may portend to a poorer overall prognosis. Previous randomized
phase 3 studies of salvage therapy containing a singleagent docetaxel arm enrolled roughly only between 49%
and 57% of chemorefractory/chemoresistant patients,6,27
and in at least 2 of these studies, the response rate to docetaxel in this subgroup was lower when compared with chemosensitive patients.5,6 Therefore, the response rates
observed in the present trial are intriguing and raise the
question whether cetuximab is capable of enhancing the
activity of cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with
NSCLC. Enhanced activity of chemotherapy when combined with cetuximab has been observed in other tumors
such as advanced colorectal cancer, which led to the approval of cetuximab in this disease: the EGFR-targeted
antibody combined with irinotecan demonstrated by an
1718

increased response rate of the cetuximab-irinotecan arm
as compared with the cetuximab alone arm in irinotecan
refractory patients.19
In a previous phase 2 study, cetuximab single-agent
elicited objective responses in 4.5% of previously treated
NSCLC patients.28 Although the response rate was somewhat lower than what is usually observed with pemetrexed, docetaxel, and erlotinib monotherapy in this
setting, the trial by Hanna et al enrolled a heavily pretreated population (58% with 2 prior regimens) and
achieved a median time to progression (2.3 months) and
OS (8.9 months).28 These results added to the pool of
data indicating that the EGFR is a valid target in treating
NSCLC, either with the use of an antibody or a tyrosinekinase inhibitor as demonstrated by Shepherd et al with
erlotinib.7
The strategy of combining chemotherapy with an
EGFR-targeted drug is controversial in NSCLC, at least
with the use of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors in the chemonaı̈ve setting. Four randomized trials failed to demonstrate an improved activity of chemotherapy plus gefitinib
or erlotinib as compared with chemotherapy alone in the
frontline setting.29-32 In contrast, the addition of an
EGFR-targeted antibody (ie, cetuximab) to chemotherapeutic regimens in the frontline setting has demonstrated

prolonged progression-free survival in advanced colorectal
cancer33 and an increase in OS and progression-free survival in advanced head and neck cancer.34 Furthermore, a
recent phase 3 study (FLEX) reported the addition of
cetuximab to vinorelbine/cisplatin statistically improved
OS when compared with vinorelbine/cisplatin alone.35
However, these efficacy improvements have not been
observed with regards to progression-free survival with
cetuximab and chemotherapy in either the FLEX study or
BMS-099, a randomized phase 3 study of carboplatin/taxane with or without cetuximab.36 The role of combining
biologic and cytotoxic agents in the salvage treatment of
NSCLC has never been proven and warrants further evaluation in randomized prospective studies.
There have been several reports that treatment efficacy may be improved based on tumor biomarker presence or degree of rash experienced while receiving an antiEGFR agent. During a phase 2 trial by Hirsch et al of
paclitaxel plus carboplatin given with or before cetuximab, patients with EGFR FISH-positive results had
longer median survival times (15 vs 7 months; HR ¼ .58;

than patients with EGFR FISH-negative results, respectively.37 EGFR IHC was not predictive for efficacy in our
study as most patients had high IHC expression. Our
study also suggests that increasing grade of acneiform rash
may be a predictive/prognostic factor in patients treated
with cetuximab. This observation has also been described
in studies with EGFR inhibitors in colorectal, lung,
pancreatic, and head and neck cancer.33,38-40 Preliminary studies examining whether patients should be treated
with higher drug levels until experiencing a clinically
significant rash have been reported in the context of colorectal cancer, and suggest improved efficacy with the use
of the ‘‘dose-to-rash’’ strategy.41 However, this remains
to be established in larger Phase 3 studies and in other
tumor types.
In conclusion, future studies in the salvage treatment of NSCLC continue to build on the paradigm of
combination therapy established in the first-line setting.
Bevacizumab was the first biologic agent to demonstrate
increased survival in combination with carboplatin and
paclitaxel in selected patients based on safety.42
Ongoing studies in second-line therapy will assess the
efficacy of doublet versus single-agent therapy. These
combinations include chemotherapy þ biologic therapy
or biologic þ biologic treatments. The results presented
herein, although not definitive, further justify the need
to investigate the possible role of EGFR-targeted agents
(either antibodies or tyrosine kinase inhibitors) in this
setting, especially in patients with a poor response to
initial chemotherapy. In this regard, the SELECT trial,
1720

an ongoing phase 3 study that randomizes patients to
either docetaxel or pemetrexed with or without cetuximab after failure of platinum-based frontline therapy,
will help answer this question in salvage lung cancer
treatment.
