Abstract
Heat stress may enhance the effect of apoptosis-inducing
agents in resistant tumor cells. One such agent is the tumor
necrosis factor–related apoptosis–inducing ligand (TRAIL),
which has attracted intense interest for its ability to induce
apoptosis in tumors without affecting nonmalignant cells.
We therefore tested whether heat stress potentiates TRAILinduced apoptosis in mesothelioma cells, its cell type being
resistant to TRAIL alone. We found that heat stress enhanced
the apoptosis caused by TRAIL but not by chemotherapy. To
explain this potentiation, we found that heat stress decreased
Akt phosphorylation via the dissociation of heat shock protein
90 (Hsp90) from its client protein 3-phosphoinositidedependent kinase 1 (PDK-1), a major Akt kinase. The role of
Hsp90 and the Akt pathway was confirmed by showing that
inhibitors of Hsp90 and the phosphatidyilinositol-3 kinase/
Akt pathway reproduced the effect of heat stress on TRAILinduced apoptosis and that the effect of inhibiting Hsp90 on
TRAIL-induced apoptosis could be overcome by activating the
Akt pathway with a constitutively active construct of the Akt
kinase PDK-1. The effect of heat stress involved multiple steps
of the apoptotic machinery. Heat stress potentiated the death
receptor pathway, as shown by an increase in TRAIL-induced
caspase 8 cleavage. Nonetheless, knockdown of Bid, the main
intermediary molecule from the death receptor pathway to
the mitochondria, inhibited the effect of heat stress, showing
that mitochondrial amplification was required for potentiation by heat stress. In summary, these results support the
novel concept that heat stress inhibits the Akt pathway by
dissociating PDK-1 from its chaperone Hsp90, leading to
potentiation of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in resistant malignant cells. [Cancer Res 2007;67(6):2865–71]

Introduction
The heat shock or stress protein response (SPR) has been
classically defined as a highly conserved cellular defense mechanism characterized by the increased expression of stress proteins
(1). This defense mechanism allows the cell to withstand a

subsequent insult that would otherwise be lethal, a phenomenon
referred as ‘‘thermotolerance’’ or ‘‘preconditioning.’’ Nonetheless,
there seems to be a two-phase response to stress. The later phase,
taking several hours and requiring de novo protein synthesis, is
involved in development of tolerance. There is also an early phase
that takes place in the first minutes to hours and involves the
dissociation of heat shock proteins as chaperones from key
signaling molecules and the consequent inhibition of some
signaling pathways (1). It is known that heat shock proteins can
act as essential factors in numerous cell signaling pathways (2–4),
and heat stress, by dissociating those chaperones from key
signaling molecules, may affect key cellular responses in this early
phase of SPR. Whereas heat stress may protect cells in the later
phase, heat stress may enhance cell death in the early phase.
Heat is now used clinically in combination with i.p. or
intrapleural chemotherapy to enhance the therapeutic response
of various tumors (5), including mesothelioma (6), but the
mechanism of this sensitization is unclear. For example, heat
may act directly by increasing cellular toxicity or may act indirectly
by increasing the penetration of the agents into the tumor. In
studies using tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis–inducing
ligand (TRAIL) or fas ligand, there is evidence that heat can
increase apoptosis via the death receptor pathway (7, 8). In these
studies, heat stress promoted the ability of the death receptor
ligand to induce cleavage of caspase 8, the initiator caspase. In
some cells, such as the lymphocytes and Jurkat cells used in these
studies (type I cells), such enhancement of death receptor signals
can be sufficient to increase apoptosis. Other cells, including most
solid tumor cells (type II cells), require amplification of death
receptor signals at the mitochondria (9). Recruitment of the
mitochondrial apparatus involves the caspase 8–dependent
cleavage of an intermediary molecule, the BH3-only protein Bid,
that then interacts with mitochondrial molecules to promote the
release of apoptotic effectors. In this study, we have asked whether
heat stress enhances apoptotic responses of malignant mesothelioma cells to TRAIL or to chemotherapy. We chose to study
mesothelioma cells, which as type II cells require the mitochondrial apparatus for TRAIL-induced apoptosis, because they are
derived from a tumor resistant to existing therapies (10, 11) and a
tumor that may respond to heat stress clinically (6). In addition,
like many tumors when studied in vitro, mesothelioma is resistant
both to TRAIL and to chemotherapeutic agents, as shown by
studies using cell lines (12) and actual tumor fragment spheroids
(13). We focused on the human mesothelioma cell line M28,
because in this line we have extensively studied the mechanism of
sensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by DNA damaging
agents (14).

We report here that mesothelioma cells can be sensitized to
TRAIL-induced apoptosis by heat stress, a sensitization that lasted
for at least 12 h after the stress. Interestingly, heat stress did not
enhance the apoptosis caused by several chemotherapeutic agents
nor did heat stress sensitize nonmalignant mesothelial cells to
TRAIL. We further report that this sensitization is due to the
inhibition of the phosphatidyilinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway
via a dissociation of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) from its client
protein 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK-1), a major
kinase of Akt. Heat stress enhanced the TRAIL-induced cleavage of
caspase 8 but also required an amplification step involving the
mitochondria as shown by the need for Bid. These results support
the novel concept that the dissociation of Hsp90 from its client
protein PDK-1 observed early after heat stress is an important
mechanism to explain how the activation of SPR facilitates
apoptosis in cancer cells that are otherwise resistant to classic
therapies.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. Human recombinant TRAIL (375-TL, histidine-tagged extracellular domain) was purchased from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN)
and used at a final concentration of 1.0 or 2.5 ng/mL. Anisomycin (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO), an agent that sensitizes to TRAIL by toxic effects on
ribosomes, was used at the final concentration of 25 ng/mL. Etoposide was
purchased from Bedford Laboratories (Bedford, OH), dissolved in Me2SO,
and used at final concentration of 10 or 150 Ag/mL. Gemcitabine (Eli Lilly,
Indianapolis, IN) was used at the final concentration of 0.15 or 3 mmol/L.
Cisplatin (SICOR Pharmaceuticals, Irvine, CA) was used at the final
concentration of 40 or 400 Amol/L. The concentrations for the chemotherapeutic agents (etoposide, gemicitabine, and cisplatin) were chosen to
represent, at the lower range, concentrations used in cell culture (14) and, at
the higher range, those used in i.p. chemotherapy (5). LY294002, an inhibitor
of the PI3K/Akt, was used at the concentration of 50 Amol/L and was
obtained from Sigma.
Bid, Akt, phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt, both serine and threonine),
phosphorylated p70S6K, caspase 8, and h-actin antibodies were obtained
from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). C-FLIP antibody was obtained from
Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Hsp90 antibody was obtained from
Stressgen (Victoria, Canada). Protein A-Sepharose and G-Sepharose beads
were purchased from Amersham (Piscataway, NJ). Protein concentration of
cell lysates was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. All other
chemicals were purchased from Sigma.
Cell culture, SPR activation, and chemical treatments. Human
malignant mesothelioma cell line M28 ( from Dr. Brenda Gerwin, National
Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD) and primary human mesothelial cells
were grown in standard media, as we have previously reported (14). Primary
human mesothelial cells were cultured from ascites fluid from patients
without infection or malignancy according to a protocol approved by the
University of California San Francisco Committee on Human Research. The
heat stress protocol was as follows. Subconfluent M28 cells were subjected
to heat stress at 43jC for 60 min or kept at 37jC for 60 min in humidified
incubators at 5% CO2. After this 60-min period, all cells were placed back at
37jC for a recovery period of between 1 and 24 h before further treatments.
The standard recovery was 1 h. Cells were exposed to TRAIL at a
concentration of 1 or 2.5 ng/mL for the times indicated in the figure
legends. For inhibition of Hsp90 function, M28 cells were exposed to 17allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG; 1–2 Ag/mL) for 1 to 8 h.
Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis was done as described
previously (14). After equal amounts of protein were loaded in each lane and
separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P
membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked with 5% dry
milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with the primary
antibody (1:1,000) overnight at 4jC and with horseradish peroxidase–

conjugated secondary antibody (1:2,000) for 1 h at room temperature.
Proteins were visualized using chemiluminescence. Quantification was done
using a digital image analysis system (NIH Image).
Coimmunoprecipitation for PDK-1 and Hsp90. Cells were washed
thrice with PBS and a fourth time with PBS and apyrase (10 mg/mL). Cells
were then lysed with a lysis buffer [150 mmol/L NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2,
10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5, TBS), 1% Triton X-100, 40 mmol/L NaMolyB,
10 units/mL apyrase] supplemented with a cocktail of phosphatase and
proteinase inhibitors (1 mmol/L vanadate, 10 mg/mL leupeptin, 10 mg/mL
aprotinin, 1 mmol/L phenyl-methyl-sulfonyl fluoride) Immunoprecipitations were done by incubating the lysates with the primary antibody
overnight at 4jC. Then, the cell lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4jC under
continuous mixing with protein A-Sepharose and G-Sepharose beads, and
the Sepharose-bound immune complexes were washed four times with the
same lysis buffer and boiled in 2 Laemmli sample buffer. Detection of
PDK-1 and Hsp90 was determined by Western blot, as described above.
RNA interference and transfection with constitutively active PDK-1.
Knockdown of Bid or transfection with constitutively active PDK-1 was
accomplished using nucleofection to introduce small interfering RNA
oligonucleotides (14) or the constitutively active PDK-1 (gift from Dr. F. Liu,
University of Texas Health Science Center) into cells. The constitutively
active PDK-1 mutant was made by replacing the alanine in position 280

with a valine (15). This mutant has been shown to increase PDK-1 kinase
activity and bypass the requirement for PI3K in transducing upstream
signals to Akt (15). Briefly, 5  106 M28 cells were pelleted and resuspended
in 100 AL of solution V (Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany) containing
3 Ag of Bid small interfering RNA (antisense strand: UAU UCC GGA UGA
UGU CUU CdTT; Xeragon Inc., Huntsville, AL) or 3 Ag of PDK-1A280V. The
Bid small interfering RNA had been previously shown to be specific for Bid
(14). An irrelevant small interfering RNA (antisense strand: ACG UGA CAC
GUU CGG AGA A dTT) was used as a control. This suspension was transferred to a sterile cuvette and nucleofected using program T-20 on a
Nucleofector II device (Amaxa Biosystems). Cells were recovered for 30 min
in an Eppendorf containing serum-free RPMI medium before being plated.
Cells were studied 48 h postnucleofection.
Measurement of apoptosis. Apoptosis was quantitated using FITCAnnexin V (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA), as described before (14). The
extent of apoptosis and the lack of necrosis (<5%) were confirmed in
selected experiments by direct morphologic analysis of cells stained with
acridine orange and ethidium bromide, as reported before (14).
Statistics. All the data are summarized as mean F SE. One-way ANOVA,
with Tukey’s test for post hoc analysis, or the Fisher’s exact t test was used
to compare experimental with control groups, using GraphPad Prism
version 4.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). A P value of <0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

Results
Heat stress increases TRAIL-induced apoptosis. M28 mesothelioma cells are refractory to induction of apoptosis by many

chemotherapeutic agents or by TRAIL given alone. These cells
were, therefore, used to test whether heat stress would sensitize
them to apoptotic agents. SPR activation by heat (43jC for 60 min,
recovery 60 min) led to a significant increase in apoptosis due to
TRAIL (1 or 2.5 ng/mL for 20 h; Fig. 1A). This potentiation was not
observed when M28 cells were heat stressed and then exposed to
several chemotherapeutic agents that are used clinically in
combination with heat stress, such as etoposide, gemcitabine, or
cisplatin (Fig. 1A).
To determine whether heat stress permanently sensitized M28
cells to TRAIL or whether this sensitization was time dependent,
apoptosis was measured after increasing recovery times from heat
stress. We found that, in the malignant cells, the potentiation by
heat stress was maximal when TRAIL was given after a 1-h recovery
from heat stress but was still present after a 12-h recovery (Fig. 1B).
At 24 h of recovery, the level of apoptosis had returned to that seen
with TRAIL alone. Thus, the potentiation of TRAIL-induced
apoptosis by heat stress is a transient phenomenon. In contrast,
for nonmalignant human mesothelial cells, heat stress, even after
1 h of recovery, failed to potentiate the effect of TRAIL (Fig. 1C).
Heat stress inhibits the Akt pathway. Because the Akt pathway,
constitutively active in M28 cells (16), is a known survival pathway
able to counteract TRAIL-induced apoptosis (17), we investigated
the effect of heat stress on Akt phosphorylation and activation. Heat
stress significantly attenuated Akt phosphorylation at serine 473

(Fig. 2A) and at threonine 308 (data not shown). The decrease in
p-Akt was still present 12 h after heat but not after 24 h (data not
shown). As further evidence of the inhibition of Akt activity, SPR
activation also decreased the phosphorylation of p70S6K, a
downstream member of the Akt pathway (Fig. 2B). To confirm the
role of the Akt pathway in preventing the apoptosis of mesothelioma cells, M28 cells were treated with LY294002 (50 Amol/L), an
inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt pathway. LY294002 inhibited the
phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 2C) and increased TRAIL-induced
apoptosis to the same level as observed after heat stress (Fig. 2D).
Heat stress inhibits the Akt pathway via the dissociation of
Hsp90 from its client protein PDK-1, a major kinase for Akt.
We have previously reported that the dissociation of Hsp90 from its
client proteins is one of the mechanisms by which SPR activation
inhibits cell transduction pathways (4). We therefore tested the
hypothesis that activation of SPR by heat would dissociate Hsp90
from Akt or from its upstream kinases. We were unable to identify
an association between Hsp90 and Akt itself but were able to show

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (6). March 15, 2007

an association between Hsp90 and PDK-1, a major kinase for Akt
and a known client protein of Hsp90 (18). Using immunoprecipitation, we found that Hsp90 formed a complex with PDK-1 in the
unstressed cell that was not observed after the cells were heat
stressed (Fig. 3A). To explore the role of the dissociation of Hsp90
from PDK-1 in inhibiting the Akt pathway and potentiating TRAILinduced apoptosis, we tested the effects of an inhibitor of Hsp90
ATPase activity, 17-AAG. Similarly to heat stress, 17-AAG led to a
dissociation of Hsp90 from PDK-1 (Fig. 3B), caused an inhibition of
Akt phosphorylation at serine 473 (Fig. 3C) and at threonine 308
(data not shown), and potentiated the apoptosis induced by TRAIL
(Fig. 3D). These data using 17-AAG support the hypothesis that the
binding of Hsp90 to the Akt kinase PDK-1 is important in the
activation of the Akt signaling pathway and that the activation of
this pathway antagonizes TRAIL-induced apoptosis. If this is true,
then using a constitutively active PDK-1 kinase that does not
require Hsp90 binding for its activity should abrogate the effect of
17-AAG on Akt phosphorylation and apoptosis. M28 cells were thus

knockdown of Bid, the key intermediary protein cleaved by
caspase 8 cleavage and mediating mitochondrial amplification of
TRAIL signals, would have little effect on the ability of heat stress
to enhance apoptosis. Instead, we found that Bid depletion by RNA
interference significantly reduced the effect of heat stress on

transfection with a constitutively active PDK-1 plasmid. Forty-eight hours later,
the cells were exposed to 17-AAG (1 Ag/mL for 1 h). The active PDK-1 was able
to prevent the decrease in p-Akt seen with 17-AAG. B, transfection of M28
cells with constitutively active PDK-1 prevented the ability of heat stress or
17-AAG (1 Ag/mL for 8 h) to potentiate TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Columns,

transfected with a constitutively active PDK-1 that successfully
maintained the level of p-Akt and prevented its decrease by 17-AAG
(Fig. 4A). Significantly, the constitutively active PDK-1 inhibited the
ability of heat stress or 17-AAG to potentiate TRAIL-induced
apoptosis (Fig. 4B). Thus, taken together, these results indicate that
the dissociation of Hsp90 from its client protein PDK-1 observed
early after SPR activation is an important mechanism by which SPR
inhibits the PDK-1/Akt pathway and, thus, contributes to the
apoptotic synergy between heat stress and TRAIL in malignant
cells.
Heat stress increases TRAIL-induced caspase 8 cleavage and
uses Bid and mitochondrial amplification to potentiate
TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Further studies were undertaken to
identify steps in the TRAIL apoptotic pathway that were enhanced
by the heat stress. After heat stress, TRAIL induced an increased
cleavage of both caspase 8 and the caspase 8 target Bid (Fig. 5A
and B). Due to the increase in TRAIL-induced caspase 8 and Bid
cleavage caused by heat stress, we then examined whether this
effect was associated with a decrease in c-FLIP expression, as has
previously been reported (7, 8). We found that SPR activation by
heat led to a decrease in the expression of c-FLIP (Fig. 5C). In type I
cells, such as lymphocytes, caspase 8 cleavage due to death
receptor signals can be sufficient to mediate apoptosis. Thus, we
then asked whether the increase in death receptor signaling and
caspase 8 cleavage was sufficient to explain the increase in TRAILinduced apoptosis seen after heat stress. We reasoned that if the
increase in caspase 8 cleavage fully accounted for the effect of SPR
activation on TRAIL-induced apoptosis by activating downstream
caspases and initiating apoptosis as in type I cells, then mitochondrial amplification would not be necessary. If so, then

in TRAIL-induced caspase 8 cleavage as judged by an increased detection of
the large 43-kDa fragment of caspase 8. In addition, heat stress induced an

Bid. Actin was used as a standard to confirm equivalent protein loading. One

Discussion
Activation of SPR with heat is currently used as adjuvant therapy
in combination with irradiation or chemotherapeutic agents for the
treatment of several types of cancers in humans (5) including
malignant mesothelioma (6), a tumor resistant to current therapies
(10, 11). However, the underlying mechanisms for additive or
synergistic effects of heat stress in cancer therapy are unknown.
At the same time, TRAIL has become an attractive strategy for
inducing apoptosis in cancer cells (19), although many cancer cells,
such as mesothelioma, are resistant to TRAIL when used alone (20).
Thus, the first objective of these studies was to determine whether
activation of SPR by heat would alter apoptosis due to either
TRAIL or chemotherapeutic agents in a mesothelioma cell line,
one that is well studied for mechanisms of apoptotic synergy (14).
In the present study, we found that these mesothelioma cells can
be sensitized to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by heat stress, whereas
there was no effect of heat on the apoptosis caused by chemotherapeutic agents. This sensitization to apoptosis was specific for
the malignant mesothelioma cells with no sensitization seen for
nonmalignant mesothelial cells. Interestingly, the effect of heat
stress was predominantly proapoptotic and was not overwhelmed
by the SPR-induced expression of heat shock proteins that exert
antiapoptotic effects, such as Hsp72 (expressed 8 h after heat stress

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (6). March 15, 2007

treatment in M28 cells, data not shown; ref. 21). These findings
suggest that the proapoptotic effects of heat stress dominate, at
least in the first 12 h, over its potential antiapoptotic effects. The
lack of effect of heat on the apoptosis due to chemotherapeutic
agents suggests that beneficial effects of heat stress on responses to
chemotherapy may be derived from mechanisms other than
apoptosis. It further suggests that heated approaches could be
effective in combination with TRAIL or TRAIL receptor agonists,
now in phases I and II of clinical trials (22).
It has previously been reported that PI3K/Akt is a critical
survival pathway for cancer cells (17) and is constitutively activated
in many cancers including mesothelioma (16, 23). Our results have
shown for the first time that heat stress can significantly attenuate
Akt activity and, thereby, enhance apoptotic responses to TRAIL.
The inhibitory effect of heat stress on Akt phosphorylation was
present for at least 12 h after the end of heat stress, but was lost by
24 h, at the same time course over which heat stress potentiated to
TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The importance of the inhibition of the
Akt pathway by heat stress on TRAIL-induced apoptosis was
underscored by (a) the ability of PI3K/Akt inhibitors to enhance
TRAIL apoptosis and (b) the ability of restoration of Akt
phosphorylation with a constitutively active PDK-1 construct to
ablate the effect of heat stress in these mesothelioma cells. In
summary, heat stress was shown to inhibit an important survival
pathway in these cells, at least for 12 h in the early phase of SPR.
Due to the widespread importance of the Akt pathway in cancer
survival, these findings may apply not only to mesothelioma but
also to other tumors that rely on Akt survival signals for resistance
to apoptotic stresses, such as TRAIL.
We believe we have also identified the mechanism by which heat
stress inhibits the PI3K/Akt pathway. In previous studies, we
reported that activation of the heat shock response inhibited the
NF-nB pathway by dissociating Hsp90 from its client protein InB
kinase, a major mediator of this pathway (4). In these studies of the
PI3K/Akt pathway, we show that heat stress similarly causes the
dissociation of Hsp90 from its known client protein PDK-1, a major
kinase for Akt (18, 24). We confirmed the importance of Hsp90 in
the effect of heat stress by demonstrating that the potentiation of
TRAIL-induced apoptosis on mesothelioma cells could be reproduced by using an inhibitor of Hsp90, 17-AAG. Indeed, the
inhibition of Hsp90 by 17-AAG has been shown to sensitize other
cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (25, 26), possibly via a
mechanism similar to the one we outline here, by inhibition of key
survival pathways. Furthermore, the effect of Hsp90 inhibition on
TRAIL-induced apoptosis could be overcome by activating the Akt
pathway with a constitutively active construct of the Akt kinase
PDK-1. Normally, then, Hsp90 functions as a positive regulator of
multiple cell transduction pathways, allowing the client protein to
be folded in the correct conformation and preventing its
degradation by the proteasome (27). We have learned that heat
stress can disrupt this normal supportive function of Hsp90,
thereby down-regulating various survival pathways, such as NF-nB
and PI3K/Akt. In summary, we show that heat stress causes the
potentiation of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in mesothelioma cells by
interfering with the normal binding of Hsp90 with PDK-1, leading
to the inhibition of the Akt pathway.
Heat stress enhanced apoptosis at more than one step. After
heat stress, the death receptor pathway was enhanced as shown
by early evidence of increased TRAIL-induced caspase 8 cleavage
that was associated with the inhibition of c-FLIP protein
expression, an Akt target that inhibits caspase 8 cleavage (7, 8).

Heat Stress Potentiates TRAIL-Induced Apoptosis

We asked whether the increased signaling via the death receptor
pathway could be the sole explanation for the effect of heat
stress, as was likely the case in studies of type I cells (7, 8). Heat
stress could enhance the death receptor pathway sufficiently so
that a mitochondrial step would no longer be necessary and our
type II cells would operate more as type I cells. However, we
found that Bid and its interaction with the mitochondria were
necessary for full potentiation by heat stress. Mitochondria may
have been recruited in the response to heat stress, either due to
the increased cleavage of Bid after heat stress or due to additional
effects of heat stress on the mitochondrial apoptotic machinery
lowering its threshold to respond to truncated Bid. We suspect
the latter because, in our previous studies, these cells failed to
respond to TRAIL-induced cleaved Bid until the mitochondrial
threshold was lowered by DNA damaging agents (14). Indeed,
heat stress could be expected to lower the apoptotic threshold of
the mitochondrial machinery in several ways. First, heat stress
inhibits Akt, and Akt is known to support cell survival by actions
at the level of the mitochondria, including the phosphorylation
and inactivation of the proapoptotic molecule Bad and the
promotion of glucose utilization (17). In addition, heat stress may
directly activate proapoptotic proteins, such as Bax and Bak,
involved in the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis (28). Taken
together, it is likely that SPR activation sensitizes cancer cells to

TRAIL-induced apoptosis not only via the enhancement of the
extrinsic death receptor pathway but also via enhancement of the
intrinsic mitochondrial pathway.
In this article, we have explored how SPR activation sensitizes
mesothelioma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. We have shown
that this sensitization is due to the inhibition of the PDK-1/Akt
complex via the dissociation of Hsp90 from its client protein PDK-1,
leading to enhancement of the extrinsic death receptor pathway, as
shown by an increase in TRAIL-induced caspase 8 cleavage. In these
type II cells, heat stress was also shown to involve the intrinsic
mitochondrial pathway. Because heat is used clinically in cancer
therapy, these studies may lead to the application of SPR strategies
(by heat stress or by chemical inhibitors of Hsp90) to future studies
of TRAIL therapy. In summary, this study indicates how a
combination of different proapoptotic and sublethal signals can
offer an effective strategy for treating cancers refractory to
conventional therapies.
