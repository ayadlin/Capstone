Abstract
The aberrant vascular architecture of solid tumors results in hypoxia that limits the efﬁcacy of radiotherapy.
Vascular normalization using antiangiogenic agents has been proposed as a means to improve radiation therapy
by enhancing tumor oxygenation, but only short-lived effects for this strategy have been reported so far. Here, we
show that NVP-BEZ235, a dual inhibitor of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) and mTOR, can improve tumor
oxygenation and vascular structure over a prolonged period that achieves the aim of effective vascular
normalization. Because PI3K inhibition can radiosensitize tumor cells themselves, our experimental design
explicitly distinguished effects on the blood vasculature versus tumor cells. Drug administration coincident with
radiation enhanced the delay in tumor growth without changing tumor oxygenation, establishing that radiosensitization is a component of the response. However, the enhanced growth delay was substantially greater after
induction of vascular normalization, meaning that this treatment enhanced the tumoral radioresponse.
Importantly, changes in vascular morphology persisted throughout the entire course of the experiment. Our
ﬁndings indicated that targeting the PI3K/mTOR pathway can modulate the tumor microenvironment to induce
a prolonged normalization of blood vessels. The substantial therapeutic gain observed after combination of NVPBEZ235 with irradiation has conceptual implications for cancer therapy and could be of broad translational
importance. Cancer Res; 72(1); 239–48. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Radiotherapy is an important tool in cancer therapy. Both
intrinsic and extrinsic factors can inﬂuence the sensitivity of
tumor cells to radiation (1). The sensitivity of the cancer cell
itself (intrinsic component) is an important determinant of
the efﬁcacy of radiotherapy (2) and is adversely affected by
the activation of oncogenic signal transduction cascades
such as the PI3K/Akt pathway (3, 4). We have previously
shown that inhibition of this cascade can enhance radiosensitivity of tumor cells leaving the normal cells unaffected,
providing an attractive concept for improving therapeutic
outcome (5).
Tumor hypoxia and extrinsic factors reduce radiosensitivity.
This occurs both because oxygen contributes to ﬁxation of

DNA damage and also through less well-understood mechanisms, by which hypoxia signaling leads to activation of cytokine
signaling and alteration in DNA damage repair mechanisms
that promote tumor cell survival after DNA damage (6). As a
consequence, reduction in hypoxia has been sought as a means
to improve the efﬁcacy of radiation therapy. Manipulation of
tumor angiogenesis may be one way to achieve this goal (7, 8).
The vasculature of solid tumors is morphologically aberrant
leading to leaky immature vessels (8, 9). This, in conjunction
with impaired lymphatic drainage, creates an abnormal tumor
microenvironment (TME) characterized by elevated interstitial ﬂuid pressure, poor perfusion, and hypoxia (10). These
factors can lead to decreased delivery of chemotherapy and a
reduced response to radiation and, ultimately, treatment
failure (6).
Angiogenesis is regulated by molecular pathways with the
VEGF network playing an important role in tumor angiogenesis. Although the main goal in using antiangiogenic agents in
cancer therapy was to impair tumor angiogenesis, treatment
with some of these agents such as VEGFR2 inhibitors resulted
in the transient formation of a more regularized vascular
system (11, 12) termed "vascular normalization" that increased
radiation efﬁcacy due to reduced hypoxia (7). The difﬁculty in
clinical application of this strategy, however, is that the induction of vascular normalization is transient and with greater
exposure to the anti-VEGFR2 agents, the vasculature becomes
diminished and hypoxia increases, potentially counteracting
the previously beneﬁcial effect (13).

We and others have previously investigated the possibility of
inhibiting oncogenic signaling in cancer cells as an alternative
strategy to modulate tumor vasculature. Inhibition of the RasEGFR-PI3K-Akt signaling at multiple points in this pathway led
to vascular normalization accompanied by improved tumor
oxygenation and perfusion (14). Cerniglia and colleagues
observed similar effects using the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) inhibitor erlotinib that resulted in improved
delivery of cisplatin and synergistic inhibition of tumor growth
(15). Importantly, inhibition of this pathway seemed to result in
more durable induction of vascular normalization than with
agents targeting VEGF signaling (14).
In this study, we investigated the potential of the dual
PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 (BEZ235) and the single
phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor NVP-BKM120
(BKM120) to improve radiotherapy by inducing vascular normalization. Here, we have asked whether vascular normalization induced in this way (i) would be durable and (ii) would act
in combination with radiation in delaying tumor regrowth. We
distinguished between the contributions of the vascular normalization and hypoxia and the intrinsic cell radiosensitivity to
show the contribution of vascular normalization to the
improved response to radiation.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and transfection
Tumor cells were cultured as reported (14). The HT1080HRE-luc was constructed and cultured as reported (14). FaDu
cells were transfected using the Cignal Lenti HIF ReporterCL
luciferase (SABiosciences), according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
Xenograft studies
All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with
U.K. Home Ofﬁce regulations. FaDu-HRE-luc and HT1080HRE-luc cells (1  106 in 100 mL serum-free medium) were
inoculated subcutaneously in athymic nude mice, in front of
the right hind leg. In HT-1080 study, 2 different doses were
tested for BKM120 (30 and 15 mg/kg) and BEZ235 (20 and 10
mg/kg) p.o., via oral gavage. Only the high dose was applied in
FaDu-HRE-luc experiment, on the basis of the dose-dependent
inhibition of PI3K signaling.
For the ﬁrst series of experiments (nonradiation) testing
both cell lines, mice were divided into cohorts of 4 mice per
drug per dose. A placebo cohort that received vehicle (NMP/
PEG300) was included as well. Drug administration was commenced once tumors reached a volume of 100 mm3 and were
given daily for 1 week. At the end of the experiments, the mice
were euthanized and the tumors were ﬁxed in 3% neutralbuffered formalin. For the second series of experiment
done (radiation) using FaDu-HRE-luc xenografts, BEZ235
(20 mg/kg) administration was started once tumors reached
a volume of 100 mm3 and was given daily, throughout the
experiment. A single dose (6 Gy) was applied at day 7 with a
250-kV orthovoltage irradiator (Philips RT 250) at a dose rate of
2.63 Gy/min, by copper shielding. The source-to-target distance was 30 cm. Tumor size was measured with calipers using

240

the formula V ¼ (a  b2)/2, in which a and b are the largest and
the smallest perpendicular diameters, respectively.
In vivo real-time optical and ultrasound imaging
Mice were anesthetized (2% isoﬂuorane in oxygen) and
injected intraperitoneally with 150 mg/kg luciferin (Xenogen).
Imaging was done with the IVIS 200 system (Xenogen). Bioluminescence was calculated as previously described (14).
Tumor hypoxia, represented by photon ﬂux, was normalized
to the untreated (control) group.
Evaluation of tumor perfusion was done with the VisualSonics VEVO770 Mirco-Ultrasound platform with the RMV 704
probe by image enhancement using contrast microbubbles
(Vevo MicroMarker Contrast Agent Kit) and Power Doppler, as
described (14).
Microscopy, immunostaining, and VEGF ELISA
The vascular network was visualized using anti-CD31-RPE–
conjugated antibody (Biolegend) at the end of each treatment,
and tumor hypoxia using EF5 nitroimidazole (14). Immunoﬂuorescence staining for NG2 (1:100; Chemicon) and CD31
(1:50; BD Pharmingen) was completed using the TSA biotin
system (Pelkin-Elmer) and streptavidin-conjugated ﬂuorophores Alexa Fluor 488 and 546 (Invitrogen). Images were
acquired using the Leica DMRBE microscope with a Hamamatsu camera. Immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated Akt
(Ser473) and mTOR (Ser2448, dilution 1:50; Ab from Cell
Signaling) was as described (16). Images were acquired using
a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope with a Nikon DMX1200
digital camera (10 and 40 magniﬁcation). VEGF levels were
measured by the Quantikine VEGF ELISA kit (R&D Systems).
Statistical analyses
Quantitative data were expressed as means  SD. The
signiﬁcance of differences between the means was assessed
by 2-tailed t test or 1-way ANOVA using the GraphPad Prism
program version 4.0 (GraphPad Software). Statistically significant difference was considered as P < 0.05.

Results
Dose–response of BEZ235 and BKM120 in HT1080 and
FaDu xenografts
We ﬁrst established the biologically effective doses for
HT1080 xenografts using immunostaining for pAKT as an
indicator of PI3K activity and pmTOR for mTOR activity.
Tumors were examined after the mice had received 7 daily
oral doses (Fig. 1A). BEZ235 at 20 mg/kg completely abrogated
both pAKT and pmTOR staining. At 10 mg/kg pmTOR staining
was still apparent. pAKT staining was reduced but also still
apparent. BKM120 at the higher dose resulted in the absence of
pAKT staining with partial reduction at the lower dose. pmTOR
was not affected by BKM120 at either dose. We then tested the
effective doses on mice bearing FaDu xenografts with equivalent results (Fig. 1B). Despite the high degree of signaling
inhibition, the growth of the treated tumors was equivalent
to that of controls, regardless of the drugs or doses used
(Fig. 1C and D).

doses sufﬁcient to cause a substantial decrease in pAKT levels,
but not at the lower doses (Fig. 3A and B and Supplementary

as measured by EF5 staining (14). After 7 days of treatment
with the indicated drugs luciferase was again assessed using
bioluminescence. Figure 2A shows that hypoxia was reduced in
the HT1080 tumors only at the higher doses that led to
substantial pAKT reduction. Treatment of FaDu tumors also
led to decreased hypoxia, independently conﬁrmed by EF5
staining (Fig. 2B and C). A moderate but signiﬁcant decrease in
VEGF levels was found in FaDu tumors (Supplementary Fig.

microbubbles was increased in the HT1080 tumors treated by

multiphoton images from sections of the tumors were reconstructed to reveal the vascular structure and Trace 3D software
was applied to quantify the vascular characteristics (14).
Increased average vascular diameter, decreased branching
(increased length between branch points), and decreased
tortuosity were induced only after treatment that had reduced
pAKT immunostaining (Fig. 4A and B). The vascular remodeling effect of BKM120 and BEZ235 was conﬁrmed in FaDu
tumors (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B). Vasculature in the
treated tumors had signiﬁcantly increased pericyte coverage,
as assessed by NG2 staining, characteristic of a more mature
vessel morphology (Supplemenatry Fig. S4A and S4B). Thus
changes in vascular morphology, decreased hypoxia, and
increased perfusion seemed to be dependent on PI3K
inhibition.
The effect of BEZ235 on radiation response
Because hypoxic tumors are substantially less responsive to
radiation therapy, we hypothesized that treatment with PI3K
inhibition should lead to better radiation response. As the drug
with dual PI3K and mTOR inhibition led to the greatest
magnitude of vascular modiﬁcation, we tested the treatment
with the dual inhibitor for the ability to enhance the efﬁcacy of
radiation therapy using a tumor regrowth delay assay (Fig. 5A).
Mice bearing FaDu tumors were treated with BEZ235 (20 mg/
kg) for 7 days prior to irradiation with a single dose of 6 Gy. We
continued to administer BEZ235 daily throughout the course
of this experiment. In unirradiated mice treated with vehicle or
BEZ235, tumors reached the maximum permitted volume
(750 mm3) at days 18 (control) and 22 (BEZ2350–22), respectively. The median time to reach this volume was increased by

12 days by radiation alone (XRT7). In contrast, radiation
combined with BEZ235 delayed tumor growth by 58 days
(BEZ2350–58XRT7), a strongly supra-additive growth delay.
Because inhibition of PI3K or PI3K/mTOR can sensitize
tumor cells to radiation, independently of changes in oxygenation, we asked whether some component of the radiosensitization could be attributed to this effect by treating mice with
a single dose of BEZ235 only on the day of irradiation (Fig. 5B).
In addition, BEZ235 has been shown to inhibit ATR, ATM, and
DNA-PK, all of which would be expected to lead to radiosensitization (17). This schedule did not alter tumor oxygenation or perfusion. It did however lead to a superadditive
growth delay of 40 days compared with 30 of radiation alone.
Thus, the drug must lead to alteration in the intrinsic radiosensitivity of the tumor independent of oxygenation changes.
An additional schedule was tested whereby daily administration of BEZ235 was initiated 3 days after irradiation and was
continued throughout the experiment (Fig. 5C). This treatment
was not signiﬁcantly different from XRT alone. Thus, we could
conclude that radiosensitization by BEZ235 was partially due
to enhanced oxygenation when administered prior to radiation
but also affected by direct radiosensitization of the tumor cells
themselves (Fig. 5D).
Hypoxia, perfusion, and vascular morphology in
irradiated tumors
We monitored tumor hypoxia using luciferase during the
radiation-induced growth delay experiments described above
(Fig. 6A and B). Tumors in the XRT7 and BEZ2357XRT7 group
did not show changes in hypoxia when compared with control
and remained hypoxic until they reached their maximum size

(day 30 and 40, respectively). Mice in the BEZ2350–22 group had
a dramatic decrease in hypoxia after 7 days of treatment that
persisted until the tumors reached their maximum size. A
similar decrease in hypoxia was observed in the treated,
radiated BEZ2350–58XRT7 group. With time, as these tumors
regrew hypoxia increased, but did not reach the initial pretreatment level by the time of sacriﬁce (day 58). BEZ23510–
34XRT7 tumors also showed a persistent decrease in hypoxia.
EF5 staining at the time of sacriﬁce conﬁrmed that the
luciferase measurements correlated with hypoxia (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Thus the decrease in hypoxia persisted throughout the time of the experiment regardless of radiation. VEGF
levels were decreased in tumors treated with BEZ235 for long
time (Supplementary Fig. S5B).
We also monitored tumor perfusion throughout the experiment (Supplementary Fig. S6A and S6D). There was no signiﬁcant alteration in the level of perfusion in the control, XRT7,
or BEZ2357XRT7 groups during the course of the experiment.
As expected, both the BEZ2350–22 tumors and the BEZ2350–
58XRT7 tumors had increased perfusion that persisted until
sacriﬁce. As with hypoxia, the level of perfusion began to
decrease but remained signiﬁcantly above the control. Some
of the decrease may be due to areas of necrosis observed by
ultrasound monitoring at this time. In contrast to the ﬁnding
about hypoxia, no signiﬁcant improvement in perfusion was
observed in the BEZ23510–34XRT7 tumors.
Vascular morphology was determined in the tumors after
sacriﬁce. Mice in the control group had typically chaotic tumor
vasculature (day 18). Mice from the XRT7 and BEZ2357XRT7

244

(days 30 and 40, respectively) treatment groups also had typical
tumor vasculature composed of irregular networks. Importantly, the BEZ2350–22 group displayed normalized tumor
vasculature at the end of the treatment (day 22). The
BEZ2350–58XRT7 tumors also showed morphology (day 58)
consistent with vascular normalization, but to an extent lower
than the BEZ235-only group. Indeed, although the vessels
retained a larger diameter, increased tortuosity and vessel
density were observed compared with BEZ235-only group
(Supplementary Fig. S7A and S7B). Thus irradiation seems to
have a distinctive modifying effect on tumor vasculature in the
presence of the drug. In line with the perfusion ﬁndings,
BEZ23510–34XRT7 tumors showed no improvement in vascular
morphology.
Pericyte analysis revealed improved coverage in the
BEZ2350–22 group whereas a less prominent but signiﬁcant
increase was also observed in the BEZ2350–58XRT7 tumors.
Immunohistochemical analysis of Akt and mTOR phosphorylation conﬁrmed blockade of the pathway targets after prolonged treatment with BEZ235 (Supplementary Fig. S9), at the
time of sacriﬁce.

Discussion
Vascular remodeling plays an important role in controlling
TME, and its regulation evolves as a promising approach for
cancer therapy (18). In this study, we report that inhibition of
the PI3K/mTOR pathway markedly normalizes the tumor
vasculature. BKM120 and, more potently, BEZ235 signiﬁcantly

remodeled vascular morphology toward well-organized, longer
vessels with large diameter that were enriched with pericytes,
resembling those in normal tissues. These changes were
accompanied by improved tumor perfusion and oxygenation
and improved response to radiotherapy but only at drug doses
that showed substantial inhibition of pAKT, highlighting the
potential of signaling in this pathway in modulating vascular
remodeling and altering the TME. These data are in line with
our previous work on oncogenic signaling inhibitors of the Ras/
PI3K/Akt pathway (14, 19) and those of using the EGFR
inhibitor erlotinib-modulated TME in a similar way (15).
We hypothesized that the improvement in tumor blood ﬂow
and oxygenation as observed in treated tumors at day 7 should
result in enhanced response to radiation in vivo. BEZ235 leads
to radiosensitization of tumors derived from cell lines with
Kras mutations. However, this work did not distinguish
between the effects on radiosensitization of the tumor cells
themselves and effects on the TME (20). Administration of
BEZ235 only on the day of irradiation (BEZ2357XRT7) resulted
in an additional 10 days growth delay over XRT7 alone which is
signiﬁcantly lower than the 28 days growth delay observed in
the BEZ230–58XRT7 (P < 0.001). Moreover, BEZ235 administration initiated 3 days postirradiation (BEZ23510–34XRT7) had
essentially no effect on growth delay. These results indicate
that (i) PI3K/mTOR inhibitors function by increasing both the
intrinsic and the extrinsic sensitivity of cancer cells to irradiation (ii) alteration of TME can substantially improve response
to radiotherapy, underlying the importance of tumor oxygenation for radiotherapy (4, 14). These ﬁndings show that the
beneﬁt of PI3K/mTOR inhibition might be enhanced by precise

treatment scheduling. These (our) experiments utilized the
tumor growth delay assay which can, under some circumstances, yield different results from tumor control assays.
Relevant to this study, Baumann and colleagues found a
growth delay similar to the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab
after radiation, but the tyrosine kinase inhibitors BIBIX1382BS
and erlotinib failed to improve local tumor control in the FaDu
model (21–23). However in these experiments, the drugs were
ﬁrst administered on the same day as radiation was initiated, a
dosing schedule that would not have maximized the effect of
decreased hypoxia. Undoubtedly, the local tumor control
remains an important and relevant parameter in determining
the therapeutic effect of irradiation when combined with
different drugs (24). Nevertheless, the impressive growth delay
of 38 days observed in the BEZ230–58XRT7 group, as compared
with XRT7, indicates a substantial response to radiotherapy.
The effects of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibition on the cancer
vasculature and radiation outcome resemble the transient
changes reported from Jain and colleagues after anti-VEGFR
treatment (11, 12). Blockade of the VEGF pathway normalized
blood vessel and improved oxygenation, providing a window
for combination with radiotherapy (7). Dings and colleagues
showed that radiotherapy was most effective when administered after treatment with bevacizumab in ovarian, breast, and
melanoma models (25). Bevacizumab and continuous delivery
of IFN-b presented changes consistent with normalization and
increased radiation response in an orthotopic glioma model
(26).
However, the vascular remodeling that occurs after antiangiogenic therapy is only transient, lasting approximately 5

days (7). In contrast, our data suggest that PI3K/mTOR could
further extend this normalization window. Even though irradiation did not alter vascular density in our study, we observed
areas of leakage in previously irradiated vessels. Importantly,
no improvement in vascular morphology was observed in the
BEZ23510–34XRT7 arm. We are tempted to speculate that this
can be attributed to the effect of irradiation on endothelial

246

cells, at least in part, or to compensatory mechanisms of the
tumors cells. Radiation can lead to endothelial cell damage
which could result in partial vessel collapse and rebound
hypoxia (27–29). Interestingly, FaDu tumors grown in preirradiated tissues presented a better response to the VEGFR
inhibitors, indicating that irradiated blood vessels are more
susceptible to these drugs than unirradiated vessels (30).

Vascular Normalization by PI3K/mTOR Inhibitors

Whether PI3K/mTOR inhibitors could potentially have similar
effects on tumors grown in preirradiated tumor bed remains to
be investigated.
Increased perfusion in normalized tumor vessels might have
been expected to increase tumor growth rate. However, no
alteration in tumor growth was seen with BEZ235 or BKM120.
This could be attributed to the antiproliferative effect of the
signaling inhibitors that counterbalance increased tumor
growth from the increased perfusion or, perhaps, improved
oxygenation renders the tumor less aggressive.
How could inhibition of PI3K/mTOR pathway result in
improvement of vascular functionality? One explanation could
be that both BKM120 and BEZ235 caused a moderate downregulation of VEGF expression, at the doses which normalized
blood vessels. This is in accordance to the reports from Qayum
and colleagues and Cerniglia and colleagues with the signaling
inhibitors erlotinib and nelﬁnavir, respectively (14, 15). In
contrast, antiangiogenic agents aim at inducing a complete
inhibition of VEGF. Anti-VEGF therapy can induce tumor
hypoxia, leading to increased invasion and metastasis in tumor
models (31, 32). It should be mentioned that in preliminary
studies that we conducted, BEZ235 and BKM120 resulted in
extensive vascular damage with increased leakage, rather than
normalization, when used at higher doses than were sufﬁcient
to inhibit pAKT (45 and 60 mg/kg, respectively; data not
shown).
A second possible explanation could be the involvement of
the PI3K/mTOR pathway in endothelial signaling (33–35).
Activation of PI3K/Akt signaling upregulated VEGF and promoted vessel formation in chicken embryos (36). Promising
preclinical activity has been shown for BEZ235, while blockade
of neovascularization and downregulation of VEGF and HIF-1
have been reported (37–41). BEZ235 inhibited VEGF-induced
permeability and vascular leakage and reduced interstitial ﬂuid
pressure (42). These data complement our ﬁndings.
Moreover, Akt overexpression in endothelial cells resulted in
embryonic lethality due to abnormal vascular remodeling (43).
Transient expression of myrAkt was capable of altering the
normal response to oxygen-induced remodeling without causing vascular malformations. Therefore, physiologic levels of
Akt signaling modulate microvascular patterning (43). Phung
and colleagues showed that Akt is chronically activated in
tumor-associated endothelial cells but not in normal tissues.
Sustained endothelial activation of Akt in otherwise healthy
tissues, induced vascular malformations and recapitulated the
abnormal structural and functional features of tumor blood

vessels (44). These changes were reversible upon inactivation
of Akt, providing a rationale for Akt inhibition to decrease
angiogenesis and excessive vascular permeability in cancer
(44). In our present work, vessel normalization was accompanied by global inhibition of Akt and mTOR phosphorylation,
indicating a direct correlation between PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling and vascular architecture. It is unclear whether the
cancer cell, the host vasculature, or both are the target for these
TME effects. If it is the cancer cell, then stratiﬁcation for PI3K–
AKT signaling would be warranted. However, if it is the host
vessels, then the effect may be more universal. These data
suggest that decreased hypoxia might be used as a surrogate
marker to show PI3K inhibition in tumors.

Conclusion
The results of this study provide evidence that inhibition of
the PI3K/mTOR signaling by BKM120 and BEZ235 displays
signiﬁcant effects on TME by remodeling blood vessels and
enhancing tumor perfusion and oxygenation. BEZ235-induced
changes promoted a substantial response to radiotherapy and
showed a supra-additive effect in delaying tumor regrowth, as
compared with other drug–radiation combinations. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to analyze in detail
the effect of different scheduling of PI3K/mTOR inhibition on
radiation efﬁcacy. Modulation of oncogenic signaling could be
potentially used as a therapeutic approach for cancer therapy.
