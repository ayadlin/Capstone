Abstract
Poor prognosis in neuroblastoma is associated with genetic amplification of MYCN. MYCN is
itself a target of let-7, a tumor suppressor family of microRNAs implicated in numerous cancers.
LIN28B, an inhibitor of let-7 biogenesis, is overexpressed in neuroblastoma and has been reported
to regulate MYCN. However, here we show that LIN28B is dispensable in MYCN-amplified
neuroblastoma cell lines, despite de-repression of let-7. We further demonstrate that MYCN
mRNA levels in amplified disease are exceptionally high and sufficient to sponge let-7, which
reconciles the dispensability of LIN28B. We found that genetic loss of let-7 is common in
neuroblastoma, inversely associated with MYCN-amplification, and independently associated with
poor outcomes, providing a rationale for chromosomal loss patterns in neuroblastoma. We propose

that let-7 disruption by LIN28B, MYCN sponging, or genetic loss is a unifying mechanism of
neuroblastoma pathogenesis with broad implications for cancer pathogenesis.

Author Manuscript

Carcinogenesis involves multiple genetic and epigenetic events, yet the organizing principles
underlying their choreography are poorly understood. MicroRNA (miRNA) deregulation is
an important component of this landscape through both oncogenic and tumor suppressive
functions of miRNAs1. Of these, the highly conserved let-7 family has a prominent role in
the regulation of embryonic development and maintenance of differentiated tissues and is
among the most abundantly expressed miRNAs. It serves as a potent tumor suppressor via
post-transcriptional repression of multiple oncogenic mRNA targets including RAS, MYC,
and HMGA22–4. Let-7 is downregulated in multiple tumor types and has been causally
linked to oncogenesis1,5–8. Uncovering the mechanisms by which let-7 function is
neutralized is therefore critical to both the fundamental understanding of cancer
pathogenesis and novel therapies.
Several mechanisms of let-7 disruption have emerged in different contexts. First, its
biogenesis can be suppressed by the LIN28B RNA-binding protein9; a highly conserved
heterochronic gene implicated in cancer and reported to induce tumors in multiple mouse
models including hepatocellular carcinoma, colon cancer, Wilms’ tumor, and
neuroblastoma10–16. Second, competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) have been proposed
to sponge miRNAs, including let-7, diluting their activity through competition for miRNAs
with sites common to multiple ceRNA species17–19. Third, chromosome loss is a suggested
mechanism of let-7 disruption in cancer, as genetic deletion of let-7 is associated with
several solid tumors1.

Author Manuscript

The neuroblastoma master oncogene, MYCN, has a 910 nucleotide long 3′UTR containing
two let-7 binding sites which are almost perfectly conserved among land vertebrates,
suggesting strong functional relevance20–22 (ED 1). Coding sequence mutations in
neuroblastoma are rare23,24, whereas chromosome arm gain or loss events are common25,26.
The most well-known chromosomal aberration is amplification of the MYCN locus, which
occurs in ~25% of all neuroblastomas and largely defines poor prognosis27,28. Other
common chromosomal deletions at chromosome arms 3p and 11q are inversely associated
with MYCN-amplification. The reason for this discordance is unknown.

Author Manuscript

Here, we set out to understand the relationship between MYCN and let-7 in neuroblastoma.
A complex relationship emerged between LIN28B activity, a novel ceRNA function of the
MYCN 3′UTR, and let-7 genetic loss, which together present a unifying model of let-7
suppression during neuroblastoma pathogenesis. This model provides an organizing
principle for understanding distinct genetic patterning in neuroblastoma, with potential
implications for cancer in general.

LIN28B and let-7 regulate the MYCN 3′UTR
LIN28B is highly expressed in human neuroblastoma and its expression correlates with
tumor stage, rendering the LIN28B/let-7 axis an attractive target for interrogation (ED 2 a, b,
c, d). Two recent reports concluded that this pathway plays a critical role in regulating

MYCN and neuroblastoma cell growth12,13. To examine the relationship between the
MYCN transcript, let-7 and LIN28B, we first transfected non-MYCN amplified
neuroblastoma cells with the MYCN open reading frame, with or without the 3′UTR
carrying intact or mutant let-7 sites (fig. 1a). The full-length wildtype MYCN transcript
produced markedly lower MYCN protein levels than the ORF-only construct. Mutation of
the let-7 sites in the 3′ UTR partially rescued MYCN expression, implicating let-7
modulation as an important component of MYCN post-transcriptional regulation (fig. 1b).
Expression of LIN28B suppressed the let-7 family in non-MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma
cells and conferred a growth advantage. LIN28B rescued expression of the wildtype 3′ UTR
construct, demonstrating that LIN28B can support MYCN expression through let-7
repression in the absence of MYCN amplification (ED 2e, 2f, fig. 1c). However, when we
transfected MYCN-amplified cells with a let-7a mimic, we observed decreased MYCN
protein levels only above 15 and 80 fold increases in cellular levels of let-7a, respectively,
suggesting that MYCN was refractory to all but exceedingly high levels of exogenous let-7
(fig. 1d).

LIN28B is dispensable in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines

Author Manuscript

Next, we evaluated the previously reported LIN28B-let-7-MYCN regulatory circuit using
published lentiviral shRNA constructs to knockdown LIN28B in MYCN-amplified
neuroblastoma cells and observed comparable suppression of MYCN protein levels and cell
growth (ED 3a,b). We further observed reduced xenograft tumor growth in cells expressing a
LIN28B targeting shRNA (ED 3c). However, we did not observe an appreciable derepression of let-7 levels upon shRNA-mediated LIN28B knockdown, which is counter to
the established paradigm (ED 3d). Moreover, we were unable to rescue these effects through
overexpression of shRNA-resistant LIN28B constructs (ED 3e,f). Together, these data
suggest that the reported effects of the shRNAs on both cell growth and MYCN protein
levels might be due to hairpin-induced toxicities.
As an alternative approach to depleting LIN28B, we tested five small interfering RNAs
(siRNAs) and found that four both effectively knocked down LIN28B and, as expected, derepressed let-7 levels (ED 4a–d). Upon extended serial siRNA transfection, we observed that
despite robust LIN28B knockdown and strong de-repression of let-7, MYCN protein levels
were unaffected and there was no appreciable effect on cell proliferation (ED 4e–g).

Author Manuscript

To rule out the possibility of incomplete knockdown resulting in residual LIN28B activity,
we employed Cas9 and four distinct gRNAs targeting LIN28B (ED 4h). We observed robust
loss of LIN28B protein with all four gRNA constructs (fig 2a,b), indicating efficient
disruption of the locus. We did not observe appreciable loss of MYCN protein expression or
impaired cell growth, thus corroborating our siRNA based results (fig. 2a–d). In addition, the
let-7 family was robustly de-repressed, consistent with the existing LIN28B/let-7 paradigm
(fig. 2e,f). These observations indicate that disruption of LIN28B has little net impact on
MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells.

MYCN is a let-7 sponge in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma

Author Manuscript

The persistence of MYCN protein levels despite high levels of transfected let-7a or robust
de-repression of let-7 upon LIN28B loss prompted us to explore novel mechanisms of let-7
perturbation. We hypothesized that there might be a ceRNA in MYCN-amplified
neuroblastoma cells that serves to sponge let-7. To identify potential ceRNAs, we performed
poly-A selected RNA-sequencing (mRNA-seq) on MYCN-amplified (BE(2)C and Kelly)
and non-MYCN-amplified (SH-SY5Y) cells. We then determined the relative contribution of
let-7 target sites provided by expressed let-7 targets. Interestingly, MYCN itself was by far
the most abundant let-7 target mRNA in both BE(2)C and Kelly cells, alone providing
19.3% and 18.5% of the entire cellular let-7-target-site pool, respectively. In contrast,
MYCN represented only 0.15% of the let-7-target-site pool in SH-SY5Y cells (fig. 3a). In
fact, MYCN mRNA was the 2nd highest expressed mRNA in both BE(2)C and Kelly cells as
opposed to the 5409th highest in SH-SY5Y, demonstrating an exceptionally high MYCN
mRNA level in MYCN-amplified cells (>100-fold increase; fig. 3b). Other multiple-let-7site mRNAs such as HMGA2, IMP1, and ARID3B were expressed at much lower levels,
together suggesting that MYCN mRNA might itself be the sponge (ED 5a). This expression
pattern was validated by qPCR in a panel of additional cell lines (ED 5b).

Author Manuscript

CeRNA relationships were initially defined in part by similar expression levels between
RNAs with similar 3′UTRs18,29. Two recent reports have refined this original precept,
suggesting that for a given miRNA family, the miRNA: mRNA-target ratio is a major
determinant of how effectively a ceRNA can impact the function of a miRNA family. At low
ratios, miRNAs are sensitive to moderate levels of ceRNAs, whereas highly expressed
miRNAs with high ratios are difficult to sponge, requiring very high levels of ceRNA30,31.
We therefore assessed total copies per cell of both MYCN mRNA and the let-7 family in
BE(2)C and Kelly cells through quantified mRNA-seq and small-RNA sequencing (sRNAseq) (ED6).

Author Manuscript

We calculated 13,255 and 10,615 MYCN mRNA copies per BE(2)C and Kelly cell,
respectively, resulting in 26,511 and 21,231 let-7 target sites provided by MYCN (fig. 3c
upper panel). In stark contrast, there were only 31 MYCN transcripts per SH-SY5Y cell.
Quantification of the let-7 family in BE(2)C and Kelly cells yielded 7,259 and 1,952 total
let-7 molecules per cell (fig. 3c lower panel), and MYCN-let-7-site: let-7 miRNA ratios of
3.65 and 10.88, respectively. These ratios satisfy the tenets of the ratio-based ceRNA model
and do so as the result of a single amplified mRNA. Interestingly, let-7a was the most highly
expressed let-7 family member in both cell types, accounting for over half of all let-7
molecules. These observations were confirmed by spike-in qPCR based quantification of
both MYCN and let-7 (ED 7a, b). Even upon LIN28B knockout, the MYCN-let-7-site: let-7
ratio is 1.35 in BE(2)C and 1.78 in Kelly, which remain favorable for ceRNA activity (ED
7c).
To test the capacity of MYCN mRNA to serve as a let-7 sponge, we co-transfected BE(2)C
cells with a series of luciferase constructs containing the 3′UTRs of several representative
let-7 targets and control or MYCN ORF targeting siRNA (ED 8a,b). Luciferase ratios of all
constructs save for empty vector controls and the let-7-site-mutated MYCN-3′UTR, were

significantly reduced by either MYCN knockdown or let-7a transfection (fig. 3d), suggesting
that the endogenous MYCN-3′UTR sponges steady-state levels of let-7. We then tested the
sufficiency of the MYCN-3′UTR to de-repress let-7 targets through sponging of a let-7a
mimic. We co-transfected the above luciferase reporter constructs with chimeric
RFP:MYCN-3′UTR constructs and assayed luciferase activity (ED 8c,d). Let-7 target
constructs were rescued when co-transfected with wildtype but not let-7-site-mutant
MYCN-3′UTR (ED 8e). In addition, exogenous MYCN-3′UTR was sufficient to enhance
MYCN protein expression itself in SK-N-AS cells (ED 8f).

Author Manuscript

We next tested if endogenous let-7 targets are sponged. Upon MYCN knockdown, protein
levels of DICER1, HK2, IMP1, and LIN28B were reduced, while neither mRNA nor let-7
levels were significantly changed (ED 8a, b, c). Concurrent let-7 inhibition rescued
expression of the four targets, supporting post-transcriptional suppression through let-7 upon
MYCN knockdown that is consistent with MYCN mRNA serving as a let-7 sponge (ED 8a).
Further, these targets were not reduced at the protein level upon LIN28B knockout, which is
consistent with this model (ED 8d).

Author Manuscript

Lastly, we analyzed global let-7 target expression in response to depletion of the endogenous
MYCN 3′UTR. To specifically assess the role of the 3′UTR, we transfected BE(2)C cells
expressing a MYCN ORF transgene with a MYCN 3′UTR-targeting siRNA (fig. 3e). While
we did not see a global reduction of let-7 targets as a whole (ED 9e), we did observe
significantly lower expression of let-7 targets with 3 or more total sites or more than one
8mer let-7 site in their 3′ UTRs, which together define the most sensitive let-7 targets32,33
(fig. 3f). Given the regulation of the MYCN 3′ UTR by multiple miRNAs34 and unknown
kinetics of how let-7 activity is restored after the removal of a ceRNA, we further challenged
siCon and siMYCN cells with a modest amount of let-7a mimic, increasing cellular let-7
levels approximately 8 fold (ED 9f). We then observed significantly reduced expression
across all categories of let-7 targets in siMYCN cells, consistent with increased sensitivity to
let-7 in the absence of the MYCN 3′ UTR. (fig. 3g, ED 9g).

Let-7 chromosomal loss in neuroblastoma

Author Manuscript

While neuroblastoma has a low mutation rate, chromosome arm gain and loss is
frequent23,24. Two of the most common chromosomal losses in neuroblastoma, chromosome
arm 3p (Chr3p, ~33% incidence) and Chr11q (~45% incidence), often occur together and
seldom with MYCN-amplification23,35,36 (fig. 4a, ED 10). Upon analysis of Chr3p and
Chr11q, we noted that the Chr3p-loss smallest region of overlap (SRO) spans from 3p25.3 to
3p14.337, placing let-7g within the SRO and resulting in its loss whenever Chr3p is lost. In
addition, the most common breakpoint of Chr11q immediately proximal to the let-7a2 locus,
resulting in loss of let-7a2 in virtually all Chr11q deletions35 (fig. 4b). Moreover, loss of
Chr11q in neuroblastoma results in lower overall let-7a levels despite loss of only one of
three distinct let-7a loci38. These observations suggest that let-7 genetic disruption may be
selected for in neuroblastoma.
A model in which amplified MYCN sequesters mature let-7 in would predict that selective
pressure to genetically lose let-7 might be relieved in MYCN-amplified disease. Chr3p

(let-7g) and Chr11q (let-7a2) loss patterns are indeed consistent with such a model. To
investigate whether the extended let-7 family (fig. 4b) follows this loss pattern, we expanded
our analysis to all eight let-7 genetic loci in 202 neuroblastomas by array comparative
genomic hybridization (aCGH). We created a heat-map of copy number (CN) estimates for
each miRNA locus to compare MYCN-amplified CN values to non-amplified and observed
a significant CN difference for six let-7 loci (fig. 5a, 5b upper panel). At least one let-7
family member was lost in 63.4% of non-amplified tumors and in only 16.7% of amplified
(fig. 5b upper panel), resulting in average let-7 CN changes of −1.94 and −0.36 per tumor,
respectively (fig. 5b lower panel). This pattern of CN loss for let-7 is distinct from the
unrelated miR-103a family (fig. 5b), suggesting that the let-7 pattern is not reflective of
general chromosomal patterning.

Author Manuscript

Let-7a2, let-7f2, and let-7g were most commonly lost, whereas let-7a3/7b and let-7i were
not significantly lost in any tumor subset. We reasoned that loss frequency might relate to
initial expression level. To interrogate this possibility, we used publicly available sRNA-seq
data to examine the relative expression levels of mature let-7 in twelve distinct primary and
tumor cell lines that have intact let-7 loci (ED 10b). We observed that let-7a, let-7f, and
let-7g are present at higher relative levels than other let-7 family members, which mirrors
the CN loss patterns in non-MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma (fig. 5c). MiR-100, the
miRNA-cluster partner of let-7a2, is more highly expressed than most let-7s and their cluster
partners, suggesting that the bulk of the let-7a reads may come from the let-7a2/miR-100
locus (fig. 5c).

Author Manuscript

A limitation of sRNA-seq is that it cannot distinguish between loci that produce the same
mature miRNA. Let-7 family members are coordinately transcribed as part of larger host
transcripts (HTs) from which they are then processed, which allows for locus-specific
expression analysis7,39,40 (ED 10c). We therefore analyzed relative expression levels of let-7
HTs in six primary and tumor cell lines. HT levels for let-7a2, 7f2, and 7g were significantly
higher than other let-7 HTs (ED 10d, fig. 5d), reflecting the pattern of most frequent locus
loss in non-amplified disease. In addition, analysis of existing human neuroblastoma
mRNA-seq and microarray datasets revealed lower expression of the let-7a2, let-7f2, and
let-7g HTs in non-amplified vs. MYCN-amplified tumors, which is consistent with observed
patterns of CN loss in our aCGH dataset (fig. 5e, ED 10e). Further, MYCN and let-7
expression are negatively correlated in non-amplified disease, underscoring the importance
of let-7 disruption in the absence of the MYCN ceRNA34. These data may collectively
explain both preferential loss of certain let-7 loci and common patterns of chromosomal loss
in neuroblastoma.

Author Manuscript

Further underscoring the significance of let-7 suppression is the observation that nonMYCN-amplified neuroblastoma patients had significantly worse overall survival (OS) if
there was a let-7 CN loss event (fig 5f top panel). In the rare case where MYCNamplification and let-7 CN loss occurred together, OS was dramatically reduced relative to
the already poor-prognosis of MYCN-amplification (fig. 5f bottom panel), suggesting a
deleterious synergy between two powerful but typically exclusive mechanisms of functional
let-7 disruption.

Of note, one of the tumors in the aCGH dataset had genetic amplification of LIN28B
(CN=23, fig. 5a). This tumor patterned closely with MYCN-amplified tumors with regard to
net let-7 loss and tumor stage (IV) despite being 2n for MYCN. This may represent a case
where LIN28B significantly contributed to neuroblastoma through let-7 suppression similar
to the reported mouse model of murine-Lin28b driven neuroblastoma12.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

The known functionality of LIN28B, together with the patterns of genetic deletion of let-7
and amplified MYCN ceRNA (aceRNA) activity described here establish that
neuroblastoma employs multiple mechanisms to neutralize let-7, placing let-7 disruption at
the center of neuroblastoma pathogenesis. We thus propose that let-7 biogenesis and
function are targeted in neuroblastoma by several disparate mechanisms: high frequency
genetic loss, LIN28B activity, or MYCN aceRNA (ED 10f). This model has implications for
our understanding of neuroblastoma pathogenesis, disease modeling, and the rational design
of therapeutic strategies, and may represent a more general feature of human cancer.

Author Manuscript

First, our model offers a plausible explanation for the uniquely high MYCN mRNA levels in
amplified neuroblastoma, which enables both robust expression of MYCN protein and
adequate copies of a ceRNA sufficient to impair the function of a highly expressed miRNA
like let-7. Questions may remain about whether an observed >100 fold increase in MYCN
mRNA, which increases the total let-7 target-sites across the cellular pool of mRNAs by
only approximately 25%, is sufficient to mediate a ceRNA effect on let-7. However, our
functional data based on loss of the MYCN 3′UTR, including candidate reporter analysis of
let-7-site-containing 3′ UTRs and global let-7-target mRNA-seq analysis (fig. 3d–g),
suggest that MYCN mRNA may be a preferred target that in abundance can sequester and
impair let-7. Further, in tumors lacking MYCN amplification, our model suggests that
selective pressure to disrupt let-7 explains the well known, yet unresolved, patterns of
MYCN-amplification-independent chromosome 3p and 11q loss. AceRNA function of
MYCN mRNA also accounts for the dispensability of LIN28B in MYCN-amplified cell
lines, suggesting that LIN28B may serve a redundant let-7 suppressive role.

Author Manuscript

Our findings suggest that highly expressed 3′UTRs contribute to miRNA deregulation in
cancer, and therefore both coding and non-coding functions of oncogenic mRNAs should be
considered in animal tumor modeling. For example, both the TH-MYCN and LSLMYCN;Dbh-iCre models of murine neuroblastoma overexpresses the MYCN open reading
frame and lack 3′UTRs. Notably, the TH-MYCN model has similar patterns of let-7a2,
let-7f2, and let-7g genetic loss as non-amplified human disease and both models broadly
downregulate the let-7 family34,41, further suggesting that let-7 disruption is important even
in the presence of MYCN protein expression. Moreover, a recent report demonstrates that
high level expression of the BRAF pseudogene, which contains a functional 3′UTR but does
not encode a protein, is sufficient to induce lymphoma in mice42. Consequently, full-length
mRNA transgenes may yield more accurate genetic modeling of human tumors in animals.
Lastly, our model establishes let-7 restoration as a key therapeutic goal in neuroblastoma.
There are few neuroblastoma specific therapies, and attempts to directly target MYCN have

met with little success, despite efforts spanning the last 20 years25,26,43. The fact that
MYCN mRNA has such a strong functional connection to let-7 exposes a valuable
opportunity to target MYCN itself and provides hope of delivering disease specific therapy
to the worst prognostic class of neuroblastoma.
We show here that disparate modes of let-7 suppression are selectively and inversely related
in neuroblastoma. Given that both oncogenic amplification and disruption of let-7 biogenesis
appear to play central roles in multiple cancer types15,44–47, our model may provide a novel
organizing principle by which to consider and interrogate genetic events in a broad range of
tumors.

Total RNA per cell was determined by RNA harvest yield from 1.5 x 106 cells. For MYCN
mRNA copies per cell, cDNA was prepared using 200ng total RNA per cell type and from a
dose curve of the synthetic MYCN-3′UTR-RNA-fragment (Integrated DNA Technologies)
with Superscript III© Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies) and a MYCN-gene-specific
primer (MYCN-2 rev). 10% of the cDNA reactions were then used for qPCR as described
above. Linear regression analysis was performed on MYCN-3′UTR-RNA-fragment-sample
CT values to determine the copies per reaction in the cell samples. MYCN mRNA copies
per cell was then calculated based on the total RNA per cell previously determined.

aligned reads and summarized transcript abundances into gene-level expression levels by
summing all transcript expression levels mapping to the same gene. Gene-to-transcript
mappings, and transcript type annotations were downloaded also from ENSEMBL (ftp://
ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-80/gtf/homo_sapiens/). Unless otherwise stated, all RNA-Seq
data is presented is Log10(1+TPM), which we refer to as Log(TPM) henceforth. In order to
estimate the absolute copy number of transcripts per cell, we performed linear regression of
the spike-in oligonucleotides concentration (Log10) on the Log(TPM) using the lm function
in R for each sample. Using the slope and intercept estimated by this approach, we
calculated the copies per cell of endogenous mRNA by determining the number of
transcripts (based on Log(TPM) values) present in the total ng RNA used for library
preparation. We then determined molecules per cell based on pre-determined pg RNA per
cell. Global let-7 target analysis: polyA-selected mRNA sequencing reads were processed as
above, with no spike in RNAs used. RNA-seq datasets are available under GEO reference
series GSE81500: (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE81500).

Supplemental Methodology: spike controlled quantification of small RNA—
Through comparison to three miRNA spike-ins, including let-7-specific 5′-end-scrambled
let-7a and let-7i spikes, we sought to minimize the effects of secondary structure bias known
to exist during sRNA-seq library preparations, which can have significant effects on the
relative efficiency of reads produced between different microRNAs6 (ED 6). A total of six
synthetic spikes were used. Disparate reads per million observed among the equimolar small
RNA spikes (i.e. the miR-Neg, LET7A2, LET7I spikes have much higher read counts than
equimolar MIR17, miRNegDH1, and miRNegDH2 spikes) demonstrate both the need to use
spikes similar to the miRNA-of-Interest to accurately determine copies per cell and the risk
inherent in using a single spike to determine copies per cell for all miRNAs. The use of
multiple miRNA-specific spikes improves upon previous miRNA quantification strategies
using a single control miRNA to quantify all miRNAs8 by limiting potential disparate read
efficiencies between a single spike and the miRNA of interest. Difficulty in calculation of
relative expression of disparate miRNAs within a single dataset due to such variable read
efficiencies can therefore be mitigated through the use of spike-ins that closely resemble
each miRNA of interest.
