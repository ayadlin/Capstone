ABSTRACT
Progesterone receptor (PR) could activate transcriptional process involved in
normal mammary gland proliferation and breast cancer development. Moreover, PR
expression is an important marker of luminal breast cancer, which is associated with
good prognosis and indicates better responding to endocrine therapies. The regulation
of PR expression was studied mainly on its post-translational levels. In this study,
we found PR was positively regulated by RNA-binding region-containing protein 1
(RNPC1), a RNA-binding protein, in PR positive breast cancer. Overexpression of
RNPC1 increased, whereas knockdown of RNPC1 decreased, the level of PR protein
and transcripts. Additionally, we demonstrated that RNPC1 could bind to PR mRNA
via AU-rich elements (AREs) within PR 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) and then
enhance PR mRNA stability. Moreover, we proved that progesterone-dependent PR
functions which could induce breast cancer proliferation were enhanced by RNPC1,
both in vitro and in vivo. Conclusively, we revealed a novel mechanism by which PR
could be regulated by RNPC1 via stabilizing its mRNA.

PR activates the progression associated with
mammary gland proliferation and breast cancer by binding
to DNA either through cis-acting progesterone response
elements (PREs) directly or by binding to other DNA
bound transcription factors indirectly [9–12]. In addition
to its action as transcription factor, PR can migrate
outside of the nucleus and mediate rapid progesteroneinduced activation of a series of alternative, non-genomic
protein phosphorylation signaling cascades [13–15].
Furthermore, non-genomic activation by PR in turn leads
to phosphorylation of PR, which promotes binding to its
PREs or other elements on target DNA through tethering
interactions with other transcription factors [16].
In clinic, PR-positive breast cancers respond better
to selective ER modulator (SERM) therapy, and had a
significant improvement than PR-negative tumors [17, 18].
PR also has a tight relationship with disease-free survival
and overall survival in breast cancer [17, 19]. A recent study
defined luminal A tumors, more than 20% of PR positive

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is a complex disease, which
involves multiple risk factors. Among these risk factors,
reproductive history and menstrual state are relevant with
ovarian steroid hormones [1–4]. For women, the major
ovaries steroid hormones are estrogen and progesterone,
which are both responsible for development of female
sex characteristics and maintenance of menstrual cycle.
Besides, long-term exposure of elevated levels of ovaries
steroid hormones are known to increase the breast cancer
risk in pre-menopausal women [3, 5].
Among the ovaries steroid hormones, progesterone
exhibits its mitogenic effects predominantly by direct
action or paracrine signaling on the mammary gland [6, 7].
The physiological actions of progesterone are modified by
interacting with its receptor, progesterone receptor (PR),
one of the ligand activated transcription factor [8].

tumor cells predicted significantly better survival, which
was added to St Gallen guideline using PR threshold of
20% to differentiate Luminal A from Luminal B breast
cancer [20, 21]. Therefore, based on the expression of ER,
PR, HER2 and Ki-67 detected by immunohistochemistry
(IHC), breast cancer is classified into five groups: luminal A
(ER and PR-positive/HER2 negative/Ki-67 ‘low’), HER2negative luminal B (ER positive/HER2-negative/Ki-67
‘high’ or PR ‘negative or low’), HER2-positive luminal
B (ER-positive/HER2 overexpression/any Ki-67 or PR),
HER2-positive (HER2 overexpression/ER and PR absent)
and triple negative (ER and PR absent/HER2-negative)
[21]. Determination of ER and PR expression by IHC test is
essential for clinical application and routinely used to predict
the prognosis and to estimate patients who are most likely to
benefit from endocrine therapy.
In fact, PR expression was regulated exquisitely in
breast cancer. Previous studies mainly focused PR expression
regulation on its post-transcriptional modification, which
included phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitylation, and
sumoylation [22]. For example, phosphorylation of PR with
progestin treatment regulated both their ligand-dependent
and ligand-independent transcriptional activities [23, 24].
Additionally, acetylation of PR could negatively regulate
transcriptional activities of PR [24]. Ubiquitylation of
PR, which participated in PR degradation, contradictorily
increased their transcriptional activity [25]. Post-translational
modification by small ubiquitin-related modifiers (SUMO)
appeared to play multiple roles in PR regulation, including
targeting, stabilization, and transcriptional activation [23,
26]. However, regulation of PR in mRNA level was rarely

reported. In the present study, we presented a unique
mechanism for the regulation of PR expression by stabilizing
its mRNA. RNA-binding region-containing protein 1, a
RNA binding protein, could bind to PR mRNA via the AUrich elements (AREs) within PR 3′-untranslated region (3′UTR) and then enhance PR mRNA stability. Moreover, the
progesterone-dependent PR functions which induce breast
cancer proliferation could be enhanced by RNPC1, both in
vitro and in vivo.

RESULTS
IHC staining of RNPC1 and PR in human breast
cancer tissues
RNPC1 is expressed as two isoforms, while
RNPC1a with 239 amino is the largest isoform of
RNPC1 [27]. IHC staining was used to examine whether
there was any correlation of location and expression
between RNPC1a and PR in 90 breast cancer tissue.
RNPC1a was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm and
PR was mainly expressed in the nucleus (Figure 1A).
The representative images of RNPC1a expression in PR
positive and negative breast cancer tissues were showed
in Figure 1B. It indicated that RNPC1a expression was
significantly correlated with PR in breast cancer (p<0.05).
The correlation between RNPC1a expression and clinic
pathological features was showed in Table 1. RNPC1a
and PR cellular localization in breast cancer cells was
confirmed using immunofluorescence (Supplementary
Figure S1).

RNPC1a regulated PR expression in PR positive
breast cancer cells

2P) cells, RNPC1a overexpressed and knocked could
regulate Wnt4 and β-catenin expression both in protein
and RNA level.
Considering ER could also regulate PR expression,
ER was knocked down both in MCF-7 and BT474 cells.
Then the MCF-7 and BT474 cells were transfected with
lentivirus to overexpress or deplete RNPC1a. It was
obvious that overexpression of RNPC1a still increase PR
expression in MCF-7 cells (Figure 2Q) and BT474 cells
(Figure 2R).

To verify endogenous RNPC1a could regulate PR
expression, RNPC1a was overexpressed and knocked
down in MCF-7, BT474, MDA-MB-231 and SUM 1315
cells. PR expression had no change in MDA-MB-231 and
SUM 1315 cells (Supplementary Figure S2). It indicated
that RNPC1a could not alter PR expression in PR negative
breast cancers.
We chose MCF-7 and BT474 cells for further study,
for PR expression of these two cell lines were neither too
higher nor too lower compared with those in other PR
positive breast cancer cells (Supplementary Figure S3).
MCF-7 and BT474 cells were transfected with lentivirus
containing either control luciferase (NC) or RNPC1a
overexpression (RNPC1a). PR expression was obviously
increased when RNPC1a was up-regulated both in protein
and RNA levels in MCF-7 (Figure 2A and 2B, p<0.01)
and BT474 (Figure 2C and 2D, p<0.01) cells. To verify
endogenous RNPC1a could regulate PR expression,
MCF-7 and BT474 cells were transfected with a control
(SCR) and RNPC1a knockdown (shRNPC1a) lentivirus.
PR protein and RNA levels in MCF-7 (Figure 2E and 2F,
p < 0.01) and BT474 (Figure 2G and 2H, p <0.01) were
significantly decreased. It indicated that RNPC1a could
positively regulate PR expression in PR positive breast
cancers.
PR could up-regulate its target gene of winglesstype MMTV integration site family, member 4 (Wnt4) and
β-catenin. Wnt4 and β-catenin expression were detected in
RNPC1a overexpressed and knocked down cells (Figure
2I-2P). In MCF-7 (Figure 2I-2L) and BT474 (Figure 2Mwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

RNPC1a regulated PR mRNA stability via
binding to PR mRNA
The half-life of PR transcript was increased along
with overexpression of RNPC1a. In MCF-7 cells, the
half-life of PR transcript was increased from 4.3 h to
>8 h (Figure 3A), and in BT474 cells the half-life of
PR transcript was increased from 3.6 h to 7.6 h (Figure
3B), suggesting that PR mRNA stability increased after
RNPC1a overexpression. Moreover, the half-life of PR
transcript was decreased after RNPC1a knockdown. In
MCF-7 cells, the half-life of PR transcript was decreased
from 4.8 h to 3.3 h (Figure 3C). Similarly, the half-life of
PR transcript was decreased from 4.0 h to 2.8 h in BT474
cells (Figure 3D). Together, these data demonstrated that
RNPC1a increased the stability of PR transcript. Then, we
investigated whether RNPC1a was physically associated
with PR transcript. RNA immunoprecipitation assay
followed by RT-PCR (Figure 3E) and qRT-PCR (Figure
3F, 3G) were performed on extracts from MCF-7 cells. It
showed that PR transcript was present in RNPC1a, but not
in the control IgG immune complexes (Figure 3E). p21

described to form immune complexes with RNPC1a [27].
As negative control, β-actin mRNA was unable to bind to
RNPC1a. Similarly in BT474 cells, PR, p21 transcripts
were also present in RNPC1a, but not in control IgG

these sites, we chose site A (probe A) and B (probe B).
Besides, we chose site C (probe C) which is not rich in AU
elements as the negative control (Figure 4A).
RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay (REMSA)
was used to confirm the binding site(s) of RNPC1a in
PR transcript. The recombinant His-tagged RNPC1a
protein formed a complex with probe A, B respectively,
compared with the negative probe C (Figure 4B). Probe
D from p21 3′-UTR served as competitive probe as it had
previously been described to form RNA-protein complex
with RNPC1a. Probe C was unable to bind to RNPC1a
protein, which might be due to lack of AREs within the
probe C. Besides, mutation of the RNPC1-binding site in
probe A and B lead to unbinding with RNPC1a protein
(Figure 4B). It suggested that RNPC1a could bind to
the ARE regions of PR mRNA 3′-UTR, which could
be contested by the p21 probe. To functionally confirm
the ARE regions were required for RNPC1a binding to

activated MAPK pathway rapidly. This effect was more
obviously on RNPC1a (Figure 6C, lane 6) than on NC
(Figure 6C, lane 2) and could be inhibited by the inhibitor
of MAPK kinase U0126 (Figure 6C, lane 3, 7). This effect
was also observed in BT474 cells (Figure 6D). MCF7 cells were transfected with lentivirus to knockdown
RNPC1a (shRNPC1a) or with the control (SCR) (Figure
6E). The effect of progesterone on MAPK activation was
decreased after RNPC1a knockdown (Figure 6E, lane 2,

3, 7). The same effect was also observed in BT474 cells
(Figure 6F).

RNPC1a enhanced the breast cancer cells
proliferation induced by progesterone in vitro
and in vivo

DISCUSSION

To explore the influence of RNPC1a on PR
proliferating functions in vitro, colony formation assay
and cell counting kit (CCK-8) assay was applied (Figure
5A-5F). Overexpression of RNPC1a depressed the breast
cancer cell MCF-7 and BT474 proliferation, which was
in accord to our previous finding, RNPC1 as a tumor
suppressor in breast cancer [28]. Progesterone could
promote the proliferation of breast cancer cells. And
this proliferation could be blocked by RU486, which is
indicated to be a PR-dependent function (Figure 5A, 5B).
This function was enhanced in RNPC1a overexpressed
MCF-7 cells (Figure 5A, 5C, 5E) and BT474 (Figure
5B, 5D, 5F) cells. To further explore the influence of
RNPC1a on PR proliferating functions in vivo, tumor
formation following inoculation of MCF-7 cells in
mouse models was applied. Considering MCF-7 is not
high invasive breast cancer cell and its tumorigenicity
is weak, human tissues was implanted in NOD/SCID
mice before breast cancer cells injection. Significantly,
given progesterone 5 mg for 60 days, the tumor volume
in RNPC1a overexpression group was larger than that of
the NC group, which might indicate that overexpression
of RNPC1a up-regulated PR through which progesterone
could enhance tumor proliferation in vivo (Figure 5G, 5H).
Besides, western blot was used to verified that with or
without progesterone, overexpression could upregulate PR
in NOD/SCID mice tumor tissue (Supplementary Figure
S4).

In the present study, we described a unique
mechanism that PR expression could be regulated by
RNPC1, a RNA-bind protein via stabilizing its mRNA.
Our previous study found that RNPC1 expression
differed between normal breast tissue and breast cancer
tissue, which was significantly associated with PR status
in breast cancer patients [28]. Herein, we confirmed the
relationship between RNPC1 and PR by IHC analysis.
Moreover, overexpression of RNPC1 increased, whereas
knockdown of RNPC1 decreased the levels of PR protein
and transcript in PR positive breast cancer cells. RNPC1,
emerging as a target of p53 family, could extensively
regulate a range of genes including CG33336 gene product
from transcript CG33336-RB (p53), tumor protein p63
(p63), tumor protein p73 (p73), cyclin dependent kinase
inhibitor 1A (p21), ELAV like RNA binding protein 1
(HuR), and MDM2 proto-oncogene (MDM2). Among
these regulation, RNPC1 could directly bind to AREs
within 3′-UTR of target genes mRNA, and adjust their
mRNA stability, and exert influence on their relevant
functions [27, 29, 30, 31, 32]. In the present study, we
also found that RNPC1 could change the stability of PR
transcript and eventually increase its half-life. Moreover,
we confirmed that RNPC1 directly bound to the two AREs
regions within 3′-UTR of PR transcript by REMSA and
dual-luciferase reporter assay. So it was concluded that
RNPC1 could bind directly to the AREs regions within
3′-UTR of PR and stabilize PR mRNA and regulate the PR
expression in PR positive breast cancer.
Considering PR serving as a progesterone-dependent
nuclear receptor transcription factor, progesterone was
employed to verify the functions of PR regulated by
RNPC1. Progesterone could elicit PR-dependent cell
proliferation in the manners of autocrine/paracrine
signaling and transcriptional regulation [33]. In addition,
previous studies proved that progesterone could induce
nongenomic activation of p42/p44 MAPKs in breast
cancer through the classical PR pathway and consequently
result in cell proliferation [34]. In vitro experiment found
that progesterone could enhance the proliferation of breast

cancer cells [35]. Moreover, this effect was increased as
RNPC1 was overexpressed. Meanwhile, the progesterone
could rapidly activate the MAPK cascade within 5 min,
which could be accelerated by RNPC1 overexpression
in breast cancer cells. The enhancing progesteronedependent PR functions and following breast cancer cells
proliferation by RNPC1 were due to the PR up-regulation
by RNPC1 via stabilizing the PR mRNA.
To verify the functions of PR regulated by RNCP1
in vivo, we implanted human breast tissue in NOD/SCID
mice with bilateral ovariectomy, which could provide
humanized breast microenvironment [36]. The human
tissue-specific microenvironment is a fundamental factor
in orthotopic and metastatic breast cancer mouse models of
clinically relevant studies which could improve efficiency
and stability of breast cancer xenografis formation [36].
Bilateral ovariectomy was aimed to eliminate the effect
of endogenous ovaries hormone. In the ovariectomized
NOD/SCID mice, progesterone had significantly affect

breast tumor formation. Distinctly, the tumor formation
with RNPC1 overexpression stimulated by progesterone
was increased more markedly. This in vivo result was in
accordance to the observation in vitro, confirming the
enhancing progesterone-dependent PR functions were due
to the PR up-regulation by RNPC1 via stabilizing the PR
mRNA.
In summary, the present study revealed a unique
role for RNPC1 in the regulation of PR and its functions.
Importantly, we provided a novel PR regulating
mechanism by modifying mRNA stability. Our previous
study found that RNPC1 could also regulate ER
expression through stabilizing its mRNA [37]. Considering
the significance of ER and PR for the classification and
therapy of breast cancer, implied that RNPC1 might be
a potential molecular mark for diagnosis and therapy of
breast cancer, especially in adjuvant endocrine therapy of
breast cancer.

pathway rapidly, which impact was more obviously on RNPC1a (C, lane 6) than on NC (C, lane 2) and could be inhibited by U0126 (C,

inhibited by U0126 (E, lane 3, 7). These effects were also observed in BT474 cells (F). Besides all of these results, overexpression of
RNPC1 indeed increased the expression of total p42/p44 MAPK, which was obvious as RNPC1was overexpression in MCF-7 cells (Figure

USA) anti-mouse β-actin (Cell Signaling technology,
USA). The anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary
antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling
technology (USA). β-actin was used to normalize
protein loading. The level of protein was quantified by
densitometry.

Cell culture, treatment and transfection
The human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and
BT474 were obtained from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC, USA) and culture in complete medium
of High glucose Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS), 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution at 5% CO2
and 37 °C incubator.
For progesterone or RU486 treatment, MCF7 and BT474 cells were cultured in DMEM without
phenol red, supplemented with 5% steroid-depleted fetal
bovine serum (BI, Israel) for 2 days before progesterone
(Sigma, USA) or RU486 (Sigma, USA) treatment. To
block p42/p44MAPK activation, 5 nM U0126 (Sigma,
USA), dissolved in 1:2000 dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO),
was added to wells 90 min before incubation with
progesterone.
Lentivirus constructs of RNPC1a overexpression
and knockdown were generated as previously described
[37]. The breast cancer cells were stably transfected with
RNPC1a overexpression lentivirus (termed as RNPC1a),
RNPC1a knockdown lentivirus (termed as sh1, sh2, sh3),
a negative control (termed as NC) and a scramble control
(termed as SCR). In our earlier studies, three different
shRNA were used to knock down RNPC1, but only
one of those work well. So we chose the most effective
shRNA for the further experiment. Cells were plated in
6 wells dishes at 30%-40% confluence and infected with
the retroviruses. Simultaneously, polybrene (5 μg/ml)
was added with the retroviruses to improve infection
efficiency. Stable pooled populations of breast cancer cells
were generated by selection using puromycin (3 μg/ml) for
2 weeks. For RNPC1a knockdown, one construct (sh2)
named as shRNPC1a, with ≥85% knockdown efficiency
was used for further studies [37]. Lentivirus constructs
of ERαknockdown were generated as RNPC1a described
before.

RNA extraction, reverse transcription and
quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)
Total RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent
(TaKaRa, Japan), and cDNA was synthesized using
Primescript RT Reagent (TaKaRa, Japan) following
manufacturer’s instructions. The PCR program used for
amplification was (i) 94 °C for 30 s, (ii) 94°C for 30 s, (iii)
55°C for 30 s, (iv) 72 °C for 1 min, and (v) 72°C for 10 min.
From steps 2 to 4, the circulation was repeated 35 times for
β-actin and other genes. The following PCR primers were
used: RNPC1a: Forward, 5′-ACGCCTCGCTCAGGA
AGTA-3′ RNPC1a: Reverse, 5′-GTCTTTGCAA
GCCCTCT CAG-3′ β-actin: Forward, 5′-GCTGTG

GTCCATGACTTCCAGGT - 3′ β-cateinin: Forward,
5′- CCTATGCAGGGGTGGTCAAC-3′ β-cateinin:
Reverse, 5′- CGACCTGGAAAACGCCATCA-3′ All PCR
reactions were performed using the fluorescent SYBR
Green I methodology. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)
was performed on StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system
(Applied Biosystems, USA) with Fast Start Universal
SYBR Green Master (Roche, Switzerland) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. The relative quantification
was calculated by the 2-ΔΔCtmethod.

Immunofluorescence (IF)

Western blotting analysis

The expression location of RNPC1a and PR was
conducted by the immunofluorescence, as previously
described [37]. Briefly, the breast cancer cells were
plated in 24-well plate at the density of 5×104 cells per
well. After 36 h incubation, the cells were washed with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) twice, and then
fixed with paraformaldehyde for 20 min and penetrated
by 0.5% Tritonx-100 for 10 min, followed by blocking
for 1 h in blocking buffer. Then the cells were incubated
with primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. After washed
with PBS three times, the cells were incubated for 1 h in
the dark with FITC-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit
antibodies (Invitrogen, USA). The cells were then washed
and stained with 4, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)

Protein isolation was acquired with total protein
isolation kit (KeyGen, Nanjing, China). The total
proteins were then electrophoresed by 10% SDS-PAGE
gel and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF,
Roche, Switzerland) membranes. The blots were probed
or reprobed with antibodies. The membranes were
probed using Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent
HRP Substrate (Millipore, USA) and autoradiographed.
The primary antibodies used were anti-rabbit RBM38,
the alia name of RNPC1, (Santa Cruz, USA), PR (Cell
Signaling technology, USA), total p42/p44 MAPK (Cell
Signaling technology, USA), phospho p42/p44 MAPK

observed under 200 × magnifications. All the cases were
individually categorized by two independent pathologists.

CCK-8 assay

RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP)

Cell proliferation was assessed by using CCK-8 kit
(Dojindo, Japan) following the manufacturer’s instruction.
Briefly, 5×103 cells were seeded into a 96-well plate. After12
h incubation, cells were incubated in the presence or absence
of 10 nM progesterone. On the days of measuring the growth
rate of cells, the medium in each well was replaced with 100
μl fresh medium containing 10% CCK-8. The plates were
incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and then read at 450 nm with a
microplate reader (Groding, Tecan, Austria). All tests were
performed in triplicate.

RIP was carried out as previously described. Briefly,
the breast cancer cells (2×107) were lysed with RNA
immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (Millipore, USA) and
then incubated with 5 μg of rabbit polyclonal anti-RBM38
or non-immunized rabbit IgG at 4 °C overnight. The RNAprotein immunocomplexes were brought down by protein
A/G magnetic beads, followed by RNA purification. After
that, the purified RNA was subjected to RT-PCR and qRTPCR.

REMSA

Colony formation assay

E.coliBL21 (DE3) was transformed with a pET28a
vector expressing His-tagged RNPC1a and positive
clones were selected. After induction by isopropyl β-D1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), the recombinant proteins
were then purified by Ni-NTA beads (GE Healthcare, UK),
as describe in previous study [37].
The UCSC Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.
edu/) and a two-dimensional structure prediction algorithm
(RNAfold, http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAfold.cgi)
were used to filtrate the potential ARE sites of PR mRNA
3′-UTR.
To generate REMSA probes, various regions in
PR (A-C) and p21(D) 3′-UTR were PCR-amplified
using primers containing T7 promoter sequence (5’TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG -3’). The sequences of
PCR product were listed in Table 1S. Mutant probes were
mutated in AREs with U to G.
RNA probes were made from in vitro transcription
with a MEGA shortscript Kit (Ambion, USA) in the
presence of biotin-16-UTP (Roche, Switzerland) following
the manufacturer’s instruction.
REMSA was performed with a LightShift
Chemiluminescent RNA EMSA Kit (Thermo, USA)
following the manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, 4 mg/
ml purified RNPC1, 10 mg/ml of tRNA, 2 nM biotinlabeled RNA probe were mixed in a REMSA binding
buffer (10 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 20 mM KCl, 1 mM
MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol) and incubated for 30 min
at room temperature. RNA/protein complexes were then
electrophoreticed by 4% native polyacrylamide gel and
transferred to nylon membrane (Thermo, USA). RNA
was cross-linked with a UV lamp at a distance of 0.5
cm from the membrane for 3 min. The membrane was
blocked in blocking buffer for 15 min and replaced the
blocking buffer with conjugate/blocking buffer (stabilized
streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate 1:300
dilution). After washed with 1× wash buffer for 3 times,
membrane was incubated in substrate equilibration buffer
for 5 min. Then, the membrane was incubated in substrate
working solution and exposed.

Cells used for colony formation analysis was
conducted as previously described [28], The breast cancer
cells were seeded into 6-well plates (1000 cells/ well). 12
h later, cells were incubated in the presence or absence of
10 nM progesterone and 10 nM RU486 for 20 days. The
formatting colonies were fixed in paraform and stained with
Giemsa (Sigma, USA) after washed by PBS twice, then
dried at room temperature.

IHC staining
The breast cancer sample tissue microarrays
(BC08118) for IHC analysis were purchased from Biomax
(USA). Histologic types were classified according to the
World Health Organization (2003). TNM staging was
defined according to the American Joint Committee on
Cancer (AJCC) (the 6th version, 2002). The IHC staining
was performed as previously described [38, 39]. The
same tissue samples were stained with RNPC1a and PR
antibody respectively. The RBM38 antibody (LifeSpan
Biosciences, USA) was used at the dilution of 1:350. The
PR antibody (Cell Signaling technology, USA) was used
at the dilution of 1:500. The rabbit polyclonal antibody
was used as anti-RBM38 and PR primary antibody. The
breast cancer tissues were scored by semiquantitative
analysis upon a well-established immunoreactivity scoring
system (IRS) [40]. The final staining results of RNPC1a
and PR were described as follows. The staining intensity
(SI) was scored on a scale of 0-3. The score 0 was attained
for totally negative cases. For weak, moderate, and
strong staining, the scores were 1, 2 and 3, respectively.
Secondly, the percentage of positive cells (PP) was
scored into five categories: no staining, 1-10, 11-50,
51-80, 81-100 percentage positive cells. And the scores
were 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. An IRS was calculated
by multiplying the percentage of PP times the SI score,
resulting in a scale from 0 to 12. The IRS was divided into
three groups: negative (IRS 0-3), or low staining (IRS 4-7)
and high staining (IRS 8-12). The tissue microarrays were

Dual-luciferase reporter assay

Injection of breast cancer cells and implantation
of progesterone pellets into NOD/SCID mice

Dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed
in triplicate according to manufacturer′s instructions
(Promega, USA). Briefly, 5 ng of Renilla luciferase vector
(pRL-CMV; Promega, USA), an internal control, and 200
ng of a pGL3 reporter which contained various region of
PR and p21 3′-UTR were co-transfected into MCF-7 and
BT474 RNPC1a overexpression (RNPC1a) and the control
(NC) cells. 48 h after transfection, luciferase activity was
measured with the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system
(Promega, USA) according to manufacturer’s procedure.
The fold change in relative luciferase activity is a ratio of
the luciferase activity induced by RNPC1a divided by that
induced by NC.

One week after human tissues implantation and
bilateral ovariectomy, MCF-7-NC and MCF-7-RNPC1a
cells grown to about 80% confluence were harvested
using 0.25% trypsin and 0.02% disodium EDTA, washed
in media, counted, and re-suspended in PBS. 1×106 cells in
0.2 ml PBS of MCF-7-NC and MCF-7-RNPC1a cells were
injected into the bilateral human breast tissue in NOD/
SCID mice. Then mice injected with MCF-7-NC or MCF7-RNPC1a cells were randomly divided into two groups
respectively: control group (Con, n=6) with no treatment
and progesterone group (Prog, n=6) implanted with 60day slow-release progesterone pellets (5 mg, Innovative
Research of America) each mouse.

Human tissues implantation and bilateral
ovariectomy

Gross observation of tumor under fluorescence

Four- to five-weeks old female non obese diabetic/
severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice
were purchased from Model Animal Research Center
of Nanjing University (MARC, Nanjing, China). NOD/
SCID mice were kept under specific pathogen free (SPF),
temperature-controlled conditions (20-24°C, humidity
of 40-70%). Cages, bedding, and drinking water were
autoclaved and changed regularly. Food was sterilized by
irradiation. The mice were maintained on a daily cycle of
12 h of light and 12 h of darkness.
Normal human breast tissues were obtained
from freshly discarded material of elective breast
reduction mammoplasty surgery. Sample collection was
performed in accordance with the ethical guidelines
of the Declaration of Helsinki, and approved by the
ethics and research committee of the First Affiliated
Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. Breast tissues
were stripped of excess fat and sliced under sterile
conditions into pieces ~4 mm in width. Three pieces
were selected randomly for histological examination to
exclude primary malignant disease. Tissues were placed
in ice cold PBS until implantation into NOD/SCID
mice. Implantation was finished within 6 h after removal
surgery. Prior to implantation, mice were anesthetized
by intraperitoneal injection with 1% pentobarbital
sodium (10 μl/g body weight) (Sigma, USA). Surgical
procedures were performed as previously described,
with some modifications [25]. Briefly, 5-6 mm scalpel
incisions were made in the skin of the mid-dorsal flank,
through which three pieces of human breast tissue
were implanted subcutaneously. The mice received
gentamycin in the drinking water (800,000 U/L) up
to one week following the implantation. In the model,
human breast tissue was implanted in both the left and
the right mid-dorsal flanks. In the meanwhile, bilateral
ovaries of NOD/SCID mice were removed under
anesthesia.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

60 days after inoculation of the breast cancer cells,
all mice were sacrificed and observed grossly by the Whole
Body Imaging System (Illumatool 9900, Lightools Research,
USA). Tumors with green fluorescence were harvested and
checked for final tumor size with external calipers.

Statistical analysis
The data were analyzed using the SPSS 20.0
software. All experiments in this study were repeated in
triplicate, unless otherwise specified. The χ2 test was used
to assess the correlation between RNPC1a and the clinic
pathological parameters. The linear correlation analysis
was used to assess the correlation between RNPC1a and
PR.
The data of mice tumor volume were shown as
Whisker: min to max. The other data were presented as
mean ± SEM. For all the continuous variables, Student
t-test was used to analyze the statistical significance of the
differences between groups, and P<0.05 was considered to
indicate a statistically significant difference.
