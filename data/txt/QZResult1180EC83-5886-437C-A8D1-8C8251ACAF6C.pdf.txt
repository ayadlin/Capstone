BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the need for surveillance imaging in early-stage classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) after planned
combined-modality therapy (CMT). METHODS: Primary early-stage cHL patients who underwent CMT were included. Positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT), CT, or both were performed at the initial staging, during or after chemotherapy,
and for at least 2 years during follow-up. Imaging studies and medical records were reviewed to determine if and when relapse had
occurred. Radiation doses and costs were also calculated from follow-up imaging. RESULTS: The study included 78 patients with a
median follow-up of 46 months; 85% of the patients had stage II disease (32% with bulky disease). Four of 77 interim PET scans were
positive; none of these patients relapsed during follow-up, which ranged from 24 to 80 months. After a total of 466 follow-up imaging studies (91% with CT and 9% with PET/CT), no cHL relapse was detected. Eleven abnormal findings were noted on surveillance
imaging: 9 were false-positives, and 2 were second primary malignancies. The average cumulative dose per patient from follow-up
imaging was 107 mSv, which translated into an estimated lifetime excess cancer risk of 0.5%; the estimated total costs were $296,817
according to Medicare reimbursements. CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance imaging with either CT or PET/CT can be omitted safely for
early-stage cHL treated with a combination of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine and radiation therapy because
the risk of relapse is extremely low. This observation also applies to patients with bulky disease. The elimination of surveillance
imaging will also reduce healthcare expenses and cumulative radiation doses in these predominantly young patients. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Roughly 43% of newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients are younger than 35 years of age. With current treatment regimens, the 5-year overall survival exceeds 90% in early-stage HL and 75% to 90% in advanced-stage HL.1,2 Limiting long-term treatment-related toxicities3,4 is an important goal in the management of these predominantly younger
patients. Several risk-adapted treatment strategies, such as altering the intensity and duration of chemotherapy,5 limiting
the radiation field and dose,6 and omitting radiation therapy completely,7 are, therefore, under investigation.
Combined-modality therapy (CMT) is considered by most to be the standard treatment for early-stage classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL).8,9 CMT includes 2 to 6 cycles of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD)
and involved-field radiotherapy or involved-site radiotherapy.10 Alternatively, some patients are treated with ABVD
alone. After completion of the planned therapy, patients are followed for at least 5 years. Recommendations for follow-up
imaging include chest X-ray/chest computed tomography (CT) and abdomen/pelvis CT every 6 to 12 months for the first
2 years. [18F]fludeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT has an established role in the staging

and response assessment of HL and is sometimes
employed during follow-up. Moreover, interim PET after
a few cycles of therapy is being studied to derive prognostic information and possibly alter planned therapy.11-13
Approximately 10% of early-stage HL patients and
20% to 30% of advanced-stage patients relapse after a complete response to first-line therapy, with the greatest risk in
the first 2 years.14 Excellent disease-free survival can be
achieved in more than one-half of relapsed patients,15,16
and many new treatment strategies based on molecular targets are being investigated.17 Imaging is often used in an
attempt to detect early relapse, and it is inferred that early
disease detection enables early treatment, which leads to
better patient outcomes. However, surveillance imaging in
asymptomatic patients after the successful treatment of HL
is controversial. Neither National Comprehensive Cancer
Network nor European guidelines recommend the use of
PET/CT for surveillance imaging.8,9 Chest X-rays and CT
scans are recommended, although most HL relapses are
detected on the basis of clinical suspicion or patientreported symptoms rather than imaging.18-24 The increasing use of medical imaging has also led to concerns about
the potential long-term biologic effects of ionizing radiation, particularly in young patients with early-stage cHL
who have a high probability of long-term survival.1,25,26
On the basis of our prior work,27 we investigated the utility
of any surveillance imaging in patients with early-stage
cHL treated with CMT who achieved a complete metabolic response according to either interim or postchemotherapy PET/CT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection

Our institutional review board approved this retrospective
study; informed consent was not required. We searched the
institutional database with DAVInCI (a Memorial Sloan
Kettering Cancer Center Web-based application that enables data queries to be independently run) to identify HL
patients treated with CMT between January 2000 and December 2012. We initially identified a total of 218 patients
with cHL, and 78 of these patients were eligible for analysis
with the following inclusion criteria: 1) biopsy-proven earlystage (IA to IIB) cHL of any subtype with or without bulky
disease, 2) an age > 18 years, 3) completion of planned
ABVD and radiation therapy, 4) interim/postchemotherapy
PET/CT to document the treatment response, and 5) at least
24 months of follow-up (or until proven relapse if earlier).
One hundred forty of these 218 patients were
excluded (Fig. 1). The medical records of the remaining

78 eligible patients were reviewed. All patients were staged
according to the Cotswolds modification of the Ann
Arbor staging system.28 Bulky disease was defined as a single nodal mass measuring greater than 10 cm or a mediastinal mass greater than or equal to one-third of the
maximum transverse thoracic diameter on a standard
posteroanterior chest radiograph at the level of the T5-T6
intervertebral disc.
Treatment Plan

All patients were treated with ABVD and then involvedfield or extended-field radiotherapy. The number of
ABVD cycles administered was based on risk factors and
institutional guidelines. Sixty-eight patients received
involved-field radiotherapy and 10 patients received
extended-field radiotherapy with the following doses: 36
Gy in 20 patients, 30 Gy in 49 patients and 20 Gy in 9
patients.
Imaging Studies

Imaging studies included PET/CT and dedicated CT
scans performed either at our institution or outside facilities that followed standard protocols as described previously.27 PET/CT scans were obtained from the base of
the skull to the upper thighs (low-dose CT performed
with 120 kV and 80 mA; 12-15 mCi of [18F]FDG). Dedicated CT imaging included the chest, abdomen, and pelvis in most cases and neck imaging as required after the
administration of oral and intravenous contrast material.
CT was performed with dose-reduction protocols with
120 kV and adjusted milliamperes (range, 120-380 mA).
Staff physicians who were unaware of patient outcomes
reviewed all PET/CT and CT scans (PET/CT Volume

Viewer 2, AW suite, version 2.0; GE Healthcare). Interim/postchemotherapy PET/CT scans were reviewed
to assign scores with a 5-point scale,29 with a score  3
considered to be negative.
Analysis of the Radiation Dose and Costs
Associated With Surveillance Imaging

Average cumulative doses for each imaging modality, estimated from a representative cohort of patients imaged at
our institution, were as follows: CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, 23.2 mSv (range, 6-34.4 mSv); CT of
the neck, 3.1 mSv (range, 1.4-4.9 mSv); CT of the chest,
6.7 mSv (range, 2.2-11.3 mSv); and fludeoxyglucose
(FDG) PET/CT, 14.1 mSv (range, 11-17.6 mSv). The
lifetime excess cancer risk from the cumulative dose was
calculated for each patient on the basis of a lifetime excess
cancer risk of 5% for the general population from 1 Sv
(National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements report 115).30 Costs for imaging studies were estimated with established US Medicare reimbursement rates
for CT and PET/CT scans.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

Seventy-eight patients with a median age of 43 years were
included in the final analysis (Table 1); 48 of the 78
patients (61.5%) were younger than 45 years of age. The
major histologic subtype was nodular sclerosis (n 5 62 or
79%). Fifty of the 78 patients were staged as IIA (64%),
25 patients had bulky disease (32%), and 5 patients
(6.4%) had involvement of extranodal sites (chest wall,
thyroid gland, lung, rib, and nasopharynx).
Imaging Studies (Fig. 2)
Baseline imaging

Seventy-seven patients had baseline PET/CT scans. One
patient was pregnant at the time of diagnosis and hence
had only a chest X-ray at the baseline. One patient had no
detectable FDG-avid disease on the baseline scan because
the single site of submandibular disease had been excised.
Imaging during and at the end of treatment

Seventy-seven patients underwent interim PET/CT to
assess the treatment response either during chemotherapy
(n 5 34) or after chemotherapy (n 5 43) before the initiation of radiation therapy. Interim scans were performed at
the discretion of referring physicians after 2 to 4 ABVD
cycles or after the completion of all ABVD cycles. One
patient with stage IA disease confined to the submandibular region did not have any other FDG-avid disease at
the baseline; therefore, follow-up PET/CT was not conCancer

sidered necessary. Twenty-two of the 77 patients had
PET/CT both during and after the completion of
chemotherapy.
Seventy-three of the 77 patients achieved a complete
metabolic response, and 4 remained PET-positive (a score
of 4 or 5). Scans obtained after the completion of radiotherapy showed a complete response in 2 of the latter 4
patients and inflammation in 1 patient. The fourth
patient did not undergo PET/CT after radiotherapy, but
follow-up CT scans showed resolution of all adenopathy.
None of these 4 patients relapsed during follow-up, which
ranged from 24 to 80 months.
Twenty patients had PET/CT scans after the completion of planned CMT. Three scans were suspicious
for refractory lymphoma but on further workup were
found to be false-positives: a new FDG-avid lung nodule (wedge resection was negative for lymphoma), mild
FDG-avid foci in the bone marrow (negative for lymphoma on subsequent magnetic resonance imaging),
and reactive pelvic nodes. Notably, these 3 patients had
experienced a complete metabolic response according
to interim PET/CT scans, and none have since
relapsed.

Follow-up imaging

During a median follow-up of 46 months (range, 24-126
months), a total of 466 scans were performed in the 78
patients. The first posttreatment scan was usually performed 6
to 8 weeks after the completion of therapy. Further follow-up
scans were obtained as ordered by referring physicians. The
majority of these scans were CT scans: 355 CT scans of the

(5.4%); and 44 CT scans of the chest (9.4%). In addition,
42 patients underwent PET/CT (9%). No relapses
occurred in the entire cohort. However, 1 patient was
diagnosed with a new abdominal T-cell lymphoma 53
months after the achievement of a complete response to
therapy for stage IA supradiaphragmatic cHL; this was

diagnosed on the basis of new clinical symptoms, which
led to imaging and biopsy. This patient later died from
progressive T-cell lymphoma.
Three of the 78 patients were diagnosed with a second primary malignancy by either imaging (n 5 2) or
clinical presentation (n 5 1; Table 2). Notably, 6 patients
had false-positive imaging findings requiring further supplementary imaging or biopsy/surgery. There were 3
false-positive findings on PET/CT scans: asymmetric tonsillar uptake leading to tonsillectomy, a new left lung nodule leading to biopsy, and a new supraclavicular node
requiring biopsy. There were also 3 false-positive findings
on CT: a lung nodule leading to segmentectomy, a new
breast nodule requiring biopsy, and a liver lesion that
proved benign on subsequent magnetic resonance imaging and remained stable upon follow-up.
Bulky disease

Twenty-five of 78 patients (32%) had bulky disease.
Twenty-four of 25 interim PET/CT scans performed during or after chemotherapy (before radiotherapy) were negative; 1 scan was positive, but follow-up dedicated CT
scans showed complete resolution. No relapses were identified in this category.
Analysis of follow-up imaging radiation dose
and costs

Among the 466 scans performed for surveillance imaging,
dedicated CT scans (particularly those covering the entire
chest, abdomen, and pelvis) contributed most of the cumulative dose. Most patients (83%) had 8 scans or fewer
(25 patients had 1-4 scans; 40 patients had 5-8 scans; 12
patients had 9-12 scans; and 1 patient had 13 scans). The
average cumulative dose per patient was 107 mSv, which
translated into a lifetime excess cancer risk of 0.5%.30
One of the 78 patients had a total of 13 scans at 114
months’ follow-up. This was associated with an average
cumulative dose of 259 mSv, which translated into a lifeCancer

time excess cancer risk of 1.3%. Thus, although the radiation dose received from medical surveillance imaging was
substantial, the overall excess risk of radiation-induced
malignancy compared to general population was judged
to be low.
According to Medicare reimbursements, 466 surveillance studies performed in 78 patients incurred costs
of $296,817. On average, the cost per patient in the current study was $3805. It should be noted that the real
costs, if we assume a representative mix of third-party
payers in the Metro New York area, are likely to be higher.
Moreover, the aforementioned figures do not include
additional costs associated with supplementary imaging
and invasive procedures (ie, biopsy and surgery) caused by
false-positive imaging findings.
DISCUSSION
We investigated the need for surveillance imaging in
patients with early-stage cHL who were treated with
CMT and had a complete metabolic response on PET/
CT. No relapse of cHL was detected at a median followup of 46 months. Therefore, the current follow-up algorithm for early-stage cHL should be modified: routine
imaging (either CT or PET/CT) for the early detection of
relapse does not appear necessary or justified in these
patients. This conclusion also applies to early-stage cHL
with bulky disease.
Surveillance imaging is done with the expectation of
improving survival by identifying and treating relapses early
before they present clinically. However, several studies have
shown no survival benefit in patients with asymptomatic
relapse detected on imaging.20,21,23,31,32 Notably, the studies included heterogeneous subsets of patients with HL and
non-Hodgkin lymphoma19,20 or patients with both earlyand advanced-stage HL who were treated with various
modalities and drug regimens.20,32-34 We believe that the
role of surveillance imaging should be addressed in homogeneous subsets of patients to derive meaningful clinical

conclusions (Table 3). Our patient population is similar to
the cohort studied by Patel et al,22 who performed surveillance imaging in 78 patients with supradiaphragmatic
early-stage cHL treated with CMT (ABVD, 86%; mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone/
doxorubicin, bleomycin, and vinblastine, 5%; and Stanford
V, 9%). After a total of 2440 imaging studies, including
1636 CT scans, only 9 relapses were observed, and only 3
were detected by imaging. This study included 28 patients
with bulky disease, in whom relapse rates were similarly
low. We did not observe any relapses among the 32% of
patients with bulky disease after a minimum follow-up of 2
years. Potential reasons for differences in patient outcomes
between these 2 studies may include the early identification
of refractory cHL and changes in treatment rather than the
continuation of planned CMT, the exclusion of CD20positive cHL from the analysis,37 differences in radiation
techniques (including field design), and the long record of
successful radiotherapy for HL at our institution. Nevertheless, relapse rates are very low in both studies and do not
justify extensive follow-up imaging studies.
The current study builds on prior work from our
institution27 showing that surveillance imaging is not
required in patients with early-stage, nonbulky cHL who
have been treated with 6 cycles of ABVD alone and have
had a complete metabolic response on PET/CT. Our 2
studies were confined to patients with CD20-negative
early-stage cHL and a complete metabolic response on interim or post-ABVD PET. This is in contrast to the 10%
1990

to 15% relapse rates reported in prior studies (Table
3),22,32-35 which did not perform end-of-treatment PET
in all patients32 or included patients with positive end-oftreatment PET.34,35 Notably, because residual FDG avidity at the completion of first-line therapy is associated
with a higher risk of relapse,38 the utility of surveillance
imaging should be studied separately for patients with
positive end-of-treatment PET/CT. Relapse rates are also
higher in symptomatic patients, but the diagnostic yield
of imaging is relatively low even in this group of patients.
For instance, Mocikova et al34 performed a total of 155
follow-up PET/CT scans in 67 patients who were PETnegative at the end of first-line therapy. Although the fraction of true-positive scans was higher among symptomatic
patients (5 of 27 positive scans or 18.5%) versus asymptomatic patients (1 of 27 positive scans), false-positive
findings were quite common.
Interim PET after 2 to 4 cycles of chemotherapy is a
predictor of treatment response and a prognostic marker
of outcomes in patients with HL.38 In the current study, 4
PET/CT scans performed during chemotherapy were
positive. Nevertheless, all patients achieved a complete
response at the end of CMT, and no relapses occurred.
This is in keeping with the recognized high negative predictive value but somewhat lower positive predictive value
of interim PET/CT. In particular, the outcome for
patients with positive interim but negative end-oftreatment PET/CT who underwent radiation therapy as
part of CMT was similar to the outcome for patients with
Cancer

negative interim PET/CT.39 Moreover, the predictive
and prognostic value of PET/CT depends on the pretest
probability (a priori chance for a cure). In one recent
study, cure was achieved in 75% of patients with earlystage, nonbulky disease and in 20% to 40% of patients
with bulky disease who were treated with ABVD or CMT
despite positive interim PET/CT.40
Another reason not to perform surveillance imaging
is the occurrence of false-positive findings, which often
lead to further imaging or invasive procedures; these are
associated with patient anxiety, risks, and additional
costs.21,41 We encountered false-positive findings on surveillance imaging in 9 patients (11.5%). Previous studies
reported positive predictive values for surveillance imaging in HL of 23% to 54% with PET/CT31,35,36 and 28%
with CT.31
In the current study, CT scans accounted for 91%
of the surveillance imaging. The average cumulative dose
per patient was 107 mSv (lifetime excess cancer risk
of 0.5%), and the maximum was 259 mSv (lifetime
excess cancer risk of 1.3%). The cancer risk estimates are
comparable to those in a previous retrospective study, in
which the mean increase in the cancer risk was estimated
at 0.4% and, even with the highest cumulative dose of
209 mSv, was estimated at 1.2%.42 Although the dose
from imaging studies is considerably lower than that
from radiotherapy administered during CMT, efforts
at dose reduction should be made for malignancies
in patients with long-term survival and especially in
younger populations. This topic is of increasing concern
among patients and radiologists alike.25 Routine surveillance imaging in early-stage cHL does not appear meaningful or necessary. However, when pretest probability
and clinical suspicion for relapse are strong, it would
appear most meaningful to employ PET/CT (rather
than CT only) as the single test with the highest expected
utility.
Our study has some limitations. Patients were
selected because this analysis was confined to early-stage
cHL treated with CMT using ABVD. On the other hand,
we consider this degree of selectivity a strength because
the need for follow-up imaging is directly determined by
tumor biology and treatment efficacy. As noted, it is difficult to interpret some previously published studies that
included patients with a variety of stages, with or without
bulky disease, and a variety of treatment regimens. The
median follow-up for patients in this study is still relatively short, but most relapses of cHL are expected to
occur within the 2-year time frame that constitutes our
minimum follow-up.
Cancer

Secondary solid malignancies appear to be more
common in long-term cHL survivors; however, these usually occur with a latency of greater than 5 to 10 years.4
Screening procedures to detect secondary malignancies in
HL survivors are not fully settled but may include mammograms or breast magnetic resonance imaging screening
beginning 7 years after at-risk upper torso radiotherapy
before the age of 30 years, thyroid US monitoring beginning 10 years after at-risk radiotherapy to the neck or
upper mediastinum, and lung cancer screening CT in
prior smokers. Large prospective cohort studies with
extended follow-up will be required to refine the best
follow-up imaging strategy for this question.
In conclusion, routine surveillance imaging with CT
or PET/CT can be omitted safely in early-stage cHL
patients successfully treated with CMT because the risk of
relapse is extremely low. This observation also applies to
patients with bulky disease. The elimination of routine
imaging will result in a lower cumulative radiation dose in
these predominantly younger patients and may also help
to reduce health care expenses.
