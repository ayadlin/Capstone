ABSTRACT
Nitric Oxide (NO) and Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are endogenous regulators
of angiogenesis-related events as endothelial cell proliferation and survival, but
NO/ROS defect or unbalance contribute to cancers. We recently designed a novel
photoactive inhibitor of NO-Synthases (NOS) called NS1, which binds their NADPH site
in vitro. Here, we show that NS1 inhibited NO formed in aortic rings. NS1-induced NO
decrease led to an inhibition of angiogenesis in a model of VEGF-induced endothelial
tubes formation. Beside this effect, NS1 reduced ROS levels in endothelial and
melanoma A375 cells and in aorta. In metastatic melanoma cells, NS1 first induced
a strong decrease of VEGF and blocked melanoma cell cycle at G2/M. NS1 decreased
NOX4 and ROS levels that could lead to a specific proliferation arrest and cell death.
In contrast, NS1 did not perturb melanocytes growth.
Altogether, NS1 revealed a possible cross-talk between eNOS- and NOX4 –
associated pathways in melanoma cells via VEGF, Erk and Akt modulation by NS1
that could be targeted to stop proliferation. NS1 thus constitutes a promising tool
that modulates NO and redox stresses by targeting and directly inhibiting eNOS and,
at least indirectly, NADPH oxidase(s), with great potential to control angiogenesis.

INTRODUCTION

in mitochondria and uncoupled endothelial NO-synthase
(eNOS) as major sources of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) in endothelial dysfunction [1-3]. Superoxide ions
and H2O2 share with nitric oxide (NO) a dual role in
cytotoxicity and signalling at high and low concentrations,
respectively [4]. The signalling pathways regulated
by NO formed by eNOS are linked with activation of
soluble guanylate cyclase and vasodilation [5, 6]. NO
is also involved in pathways regulating cell survival in
response to lipid or oncogenes (KRas) (PI3K/ Akt/ eNOS

A critical pathogenic factor in the development
of endothelial dysfunction is redox stress involving
generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species,
RNOS. Identifying sources of excessive or unbalanced
RNOS levels and developing alternative strategies to
regulate their respective levels should help in designing
novel rational therapies. Previous studies identified

pathway), to low oxygen tension (HIF/VEGF/ Akt/eNOS
pathway), to metabolic stress (AMPK/eNOS pathway).
eNOS is regulated at the transcription level by NF-κB,
p53 and by post-translational modifications. Through
a cross-talk between them, NO and ROS participate in
redox homeostasis in healthy cells, a balance that is often
deregulated by pathogens and in pathophysiological
situations. In some cancers, NO acts as an endothelial
growth factor that mediates tumor growth and metastasis
[7, 8]. Inhibition of ROS formed by NADPH oxidases
(NOX) and/ or by eNOS uncoupling is highly requested
for pharmacological treatments of oxidative stress
associated with cardiovascular diseases and cancers [9].
Most current NOS inhibitors designed based on X-ray
structures target the heme site [10]. However, these
inhibitors cannot prevent ROS formed at the reductase
domain level. The design of NOS inhibitor targeting the
reductase domain could lead to “two in one” effects by
inhibition of both NO formation and undesirable ROS
production from NOS uncoupling.
A rational way to identify sources of redox
stress would be to make use of compounds modulating
NADPH levels, which requires selectivity toward specific
NADPH-dependent enzymes without strong interference
with normal cellular processes. Recently, we designed
a novel photoactive probe, called nanoshutter (NS1)
that efficiently bound to constitutive NOS (eNOS and
nNOS) by recognition of their NADPH binding site [11]
in a similar manner than our previously reported dienic
nanotrigger [12-15]. NS1 reversibly inhibited NO formed
by recombinant NOS by competing with NADPH binding
[11]. Moreover, while NS1 was not fluorescent in aqueous
solutions, a specific enhancement of NS1 fluorescence
upon NS1 binding to constitutive NOS was observed
upon two-photon excitation. These fluorescence properties
allowed NS1 imaging of eNOS in living HUVEC cells at
the cell membrane and at the Golgi levels with minimal
contribution of flavin autofluorescence [11].
In the present manuscript, we showed that NS1
inhibited NO formation and modulated ROS levels in
endothelial cells, isolated aorta and melanoma cells. We
tested how NS1 affected angiogenesis and metastatic
melanoma cells growth, two processes dependent upon
NO and ROS. NS1 probed the relationships between NOS
and NOX in endothelial and melanoma cells resulting in
anti-angiogenic effects, targeted metastatic melanoma
cell growth arrest while being non-toxic to normal
melanocytes. NS1 combined interesting pharmacological
and imaging properties, with great interest as a probe
of key redox mediators and for future anti-angiogenic
therapies.

NS1 inhibits the formation of NO produced in
isolated mice aortic rings
We have previously shown that NS1 targeted
purified NOS and inhibited NO production competitively
relative to NADPH. Here, we addressed the question of
NO inhibition by NS1 in a more physiological context.
NO production was assessed by EPR spin trapping as
formation of the paramagnetic [Fe(DETC)2NO] complex
in isolated mice aortic rings stimulated with ionomycin
in the presence of Fe(DETC)2 [16]. Addition of 1mM
L-NAME, a NOS inhibitor, fully abolished the formation
of NO by stimulated aorta as expected. NS1 decreased
formation of NO by aortic rings in a monotonic manner
(Figure 1 A, B). A concentration of NS1 inhibiting
NO formation by 50%, IC50 value of 40 ± 15 µM was
measured and corresponded to IC50 previously determined
for NO inhibition from recombinant eNOS or nNOS, IC50
= 30 ± 10 µM [11]. The in vitro IC50 yielded an inhibitory
equilibrium constant Ki being Ki= 4 ± 1 µM. IC50 value
for heme-based inhibitors as L-nitro-arginine are usually
in the micromolar range while IC50 for L-NAME being 70
µM [17, 18].

NS1 inhibits VEGF-dependent angiogenesis of
HUVECs
To assess the effects of NS1 on angiogenesis, a
physiological eNOS-dependent process, an assay of
endothelial network formation (plating of HUVECs on
matrigel) induced by VEGF was used. The formation of
cord capillary structures in the absence or presence of 1%
serum as previously reported [19, 20] was monitored as
a function of time (Figure 1C and supplementary Figure
1A, respectively). A significant increase in capillary
structures formation by HUVECs was already observed
after 12 h. The addition of increasing concentrations of
NS1 to the cells led to a reduction of their ability to form
capillary structures (Figure 1D-E). 100µM NS1 strongly
reduced the rate and the amount of tube formation and the
number of crossings between them compared to control
experiments; the significant differences between groups
demonstrated the anti-angiogenic effect of NS1 on these
endothelial cells.

NS1 inhibits H2O2 and superoxide formation by
NOS under uncoupling conditions
NS1 was expected blocking the electron flow in
NOS. Therefore, NS1 should avoid ROS formed under

reduction by flavins of the reductase domain and from the
heme site by dissociation of the FeII-heme-O2 complex
in the absence of substrate and/or cofactor H4B to form
superoxide and regenerate FeIII-heme (uncoupling) [21].
We tested the effects of NS1 on the levels of hydrogen
peroxide and superoxide ions formed by uncoupled
nNOS. H2O2 was measured in a colorimetric assay
and O2.- monitored by EPR spectroscopy using spintrapping experiments in the presence of the cyclic nitrone
DEPMPO. In the absence of substrate and with low
amounts of H4B, H2O2 formation by nNOS was 145 ± 22
nmol.min-1.mg prot-1, which was inhibited by NS1 with
an IC50 value of 75 ± 12 µM (not shown). Accordingly,
uncoupled nNOS catalysis led to the gradual appearance
of the characteristic 8-lines features on the EPR spectra
corresponding to the nitroxide DEPMPO-OOH spin-

adduct (Figures 2A and 2B). The rate of formation of
the spin-adduct was normalized to 100 in the absence of
L-arginine and H4B. As expected, this rate was reduced by
the addition of 100 µM arginine and 10 µM H4B and also
inhibited by the addition of NS1 with an IC50 = 105 ± 15
mM without formation of other detectable paramagnetic
species (Figure 2B, C). The results supported that NS1
inhibited electron leakage in nNOS as expected from
NS1 design that targets the reductase domain and blocks
the overall electron flow to the heme in nNOS by acting
at the initial step of electron injection to FAD. We then
investigated whether NS1 may affect ROS levels in
endothelial cells, and in isolated aorta.

presence of NS1 was normalized by the signal monitored
in the same cells without NS1. This normalization gave a
fluorescence enhancement factor (FEF), which accounts
for ROS formation as a function of NS1 concentration
(Figure. 3B). Interestingly, ROS detection in HUVECs
presented a decreasing phase at NS1 concentrations above
5 µM (Figure 3B) characterized by FEF values below 1,
indicating that NS1 inhibited the basal production of ROS
in HUVECs by roughly 50%.

The effect of NS1 on ROS formation in HUVECs
cells was addressed by performing flow cytometer
experiments using the CellROX® Deep Red oxidative
stress probe (Figure 3A-B). ROS formation is shown by
an enhancement of the probe fluorescence (absorption/
emission maxima at ~644/665 nm) as observed using
tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as a positive control for
ROS formation (Figure 3A, lower panel). Fluorescence
signals of NS1 and CellROX® Deep Red were measured
by using FL-1 and FL-4 channels, respectively. To
minimize differences in basal cellular ROS among

easily cross cellular membrane and is oxidized by
ROS to paramagnetic CAT1● radical detected by
EPR spectroscopy. The kinetic of radical formation
was detected by the EPR as indicated in Experimental
procedures and typical EPR spectrum of CAT1●. radical
formed after oxidation by O2.- is presented in an insert
(Supplementary Figure 2). Pre-incubation of mice aortic
rings for 30 min on ice with 100 U/mL SOD decreased
EPR signals by 80% (Figure 3C). This large signal
decrease in the presence of SOD identified superoxide
ions, species sensitive to SOD as the predominant species
involved in oxidation of CAT1-H in unstimulated aortic

rings. Addition of L-NAME (1mM) had no significant
effect on the signal (data not shown), consistent with
eNOS uncoupling (at the level of the heme domain) not
being a major source of superoxide in this model. Isolated
aortic rings incubated with 10 µM NS1 inhibited the
formation of CAT1● radicals by 60 ± 19 %, a similar level
than that observed with SOD within experimental error.
The EPR data supported NS1 inhibition of superoxide ions
generated by membrane-bound enzymes in aortic rings, in
good agreement with ROS inhibition observed with the
fluorescent probe in HUVECS at 10 µM NS1 (Figure 3B).

Effect of NS1 on ROS produced by A375
melanoma cells

by NOS uncoupling at the level of the heme domain. As
expected, DPI, an inhibitor of flavoenzymes (as NOX’s
or NOS reductase) decreased ROS levels. In endothelial
cells, NOX4-derived H2O2 promoted proliferation and is
activated by ischemia [23, 24]. We then tested how NS1
affected angiogenesis and melanoma proliferation.

Melanoma cells are characterized by altered redox
status, in particular higher ROS levels than required for
normal cell signalling [22]. We thus tested whether NS1
may affect ROS levels in metastatic melanoma A375
cells. As in HUVECs, the CellRox reagent was used for
quantification of ROS levels changes in the presence of
NS1 (30µM), DPI (100µM), or of L-NAME (100µM)
(Figure 3D). NS1 induced a time-dependent decrease of
ROS, 60% inhibition of ROS levels were observed at
96h, in agreement with a similar decrease observed on
HUVECs (Figure 3B). ROS levels were unchanged by
L-NAME, suggesting that ROS were not mainly produced

iNOS expression were involved [25-27]. Because these
enzymes associated with redox stress could be targeted
by NS1, we tested whether the number of metastatic
melanoma A375 cells decreased as a function of NS1
dose. Normal human melanocytes (NHM) were used as
a control. Supplementary Fig. 3A shows that increasing
concentrations of NS1 had minimal effect on these healthy
NHM cells after 24 and 48 hours. A low toxicity of NS1 in
HUVECs was also deduced from minimal effect on MTT
tests (Supplementary Fig. 3B) and the lack of morphology
change during cell growth recorded by video-microscopy
for 24 h (data not shown). These data support the specific
effects of NS1 activity on NO and ROS levels in HUVEC
and melanocytes.
In contrast, NS1 reduced the proliferation of
melanoma cells in a time-and dose-dependent manner
(Figure 4). The number of A375 cells decreased upon
increasing NS1 concentration (Figure 4A). As shown in
Figure 4B, NS1 (30µM) specifically reduced the number
of melanoma cells without affecting the growth of
melanocytes. We investigated the effect of NS1 on NO
derived species (NOx) levels determined by the Griess
reagent. However, NOx were below detection limit
(~2µM) in both melanocytes and A375 cells supernatants
treated or not with 30 µM NS1 during 96 hours. To
investigate whether NS1 may selectively affect NOX4
levels in melanoma cells compared to melanocytes,
western blots were performed in both cell types in
conditions in which A375 proliferation was strongly
decreased by NS1 (96 hours). Figure 4C shows that NS1
strongly reduced NOX4 levels in A375 cells and not in
melanocytes. NOX4 overexpression in melanoma cells
could be linked with angiogenesis [22, 24]; thus, NS1induced inhibition of NO and decrease of ROS formed
by NOX (Figures 1 and 3) may modify VEGF levels.
Figure 5A shows that already after 24h, NS1 (30µM)
strongly reduced VEGF levels even before significant
changes of cell growth took place in A375 cells compared
to melanocytes. After 24h and 48h, treatment of the
A375 cells with L-NAME did not affect VEGF or NOX4
expression. After 96 h, L-NAME only decreased VEGF
levels without modifying NOX4 levels. In contrast, VEGF
decreased after 48h treatment of the A375 cells with DPI
(100µM), compared to a VEGF decrease already observed
after 24h treatment with NS1 (30µM). At later times (96h),
DPI inhibited VEGF and largely decreased NOX4 levels,
as observed in the presence of 30 µM NS1 (Figure 5A).
We thus investigated if NS1-induced changes of ROS and
NOX4 levels were related to modifications of cell cycle
as a function of time. An increase of the fraction of cells
in G2/M stage and a decrease of cells in the G0/G1 stage
were observed after incubation with 30µM NS1 after 48h
(Figure 5B). Entry in the cell cycle is initiated by multiple
mitogenic stimuli, including Erk and PI3K/ Akt associated
with ROS signalling [28, 29]. Accordingly, along with a
decrease of VEGF levels, a decrease of phospho-Erk, p21,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

p27 and associated CDK6 were already observed after
24h (Figures 5A-C). In agreement with a cell cycle pause
in G2/M, decrease in ROS levels and phosphorylated
retinoblastoma Rb were observed at 48h (Figures 3D, 5C
and supplementary Figure. 4). At later stages, NS1 affected
both NOX4 activity and expression, decreased phosphoAkt and increased Akt levels, resulting in an additional
increase of cells at subG1 stage, clearly indicated by the
decrease of p53, of pro-caspase 3, increase in cleaved
PARP (Figure 5C).

DISCUSSION
NS1 is a new prototype of a reversible inhibitor of
constitutive NOS targeting their reductase domain [11].
NS1 was designed by molecular modelling, by replacing
the imbedded NADP cofactor in nNOS reductase domain
[11, 30]. NS1 shares with NADPH the nucleotide moiety
that allows proper targeting to the NADPH site; thus,
NS1 competes with NADPH binding [11, 13, 15]. In this
work, we tested the potential pharmacological applications
of NS1 to inhibit angiogenesis and cell growth in
physiological and pathophysiological cell models in the
endothelium and in melanoma cells, respectively.

NS1 targeted eNOS in the endothelium, inhibited
NO-mediated angiogenesis, inhibited uncoupling
and decreased ROS levels
NS1 inhibited NO formed by eNOS expressed in
isolated aortic rings (Figure 1A-B). The IC50 values for
NO inhibition corresponded to IC50 previously determined
in vitro, IC50 = 30 ± 10 µM [11], a value that should be
improved for in vivo applications. Improving efficacy
and specificity of NS1 by designing isoform-specific
inhibitors is ongoing in our laboratories. Accordingly, NS1
modulated endothelial sprouting of HUVEC cells in a 3-D
model of angiogenesis, a NO-dependent effect [31]. As
expected from VEGF-mediated signalling combined with
NS1 inhibition of eNOS, NS1 exhibited anti-angiogenic
effects in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1C-E). These
data show that NS1 inhibited angiogenesis, an important
NO-dependent process in endothelial cells. These
results suggested perspectives at limiting or preventing
deleterious effects of NO produced by iNOS or eNOS in
metastasis [7, 32].
Decrease of superoxide ions induced by NS1 in
aorta while no inhibition by L-NAME was observed
(Figure 3C and data not shown) is suggestive that NS1
mainly inhibited active NOX(s) at the cell membrane
[23] and that eNOS uncoupling was not a major effect
in isolated aorta. Uncoupling of recombinant nNOS was
inhibited by NS1, as anticipated from NS1 design as a
consequence of NS1 blocking the electron flow in NOS
(Figure 2). This constitutes an intrinsic advantage of NS1

over other NOS inhibitors directed against the oxygenase
domain, unable to avoid uncoupling at the level of the
reductase domain. Inhibition of ROS by NS1 (Figure
3B, C) combined with the lack of metabolic activity
modification (Supplementary Figure 1) would not suggest
a major effect of NS1 (10 µM) on mitochondrial enzymes.
Consistent with this effect of NS1 on membrane-bound
enzymes, imaging studies showed NS1 localization at the
membrane, the golgi apparatus and sometimes in early
endosomes in HUVECs [11]. We emphasize that the ROS
levels induced by 10-20 µM NS1 decreased by a factor
of ~2 with respect to basal level in HUVECS cells and
in aortic rings (Figure 3) that likely took place within the
physiological range in endothelial cells as confirmed by
the lack of viability loss (Supplementary Figure 1).

of eNOS levels at 48h hinted at a regulation in the Akt
pathway to “adapt” to ROS decrease (Figures 3D and 5C).
Enhanced eNOS levels were observed in NOX-knockeddown coronary vessel [39]. Additionally, an indirect NS1induced decrease of NOX activity at early times as result
of inhibition downstream to Akt cannot be excluded [40].
Whatever the exact mechanism(s) involved, NS1 induced
a decrease of VEGF, ROS levels, activated Erk and a
cell cycle arrest at G2/M after 48h (Figures 3D, 5C and
supplementary Figure 4) [22, 41].
At late times, NS1-induced decrease of ROS levels
at the membrane may affect the cytosolic ROS pool [42]
since NOX4 also localized at the ER and the nucleus. ROS
generated by NOX4, was partly depleted by NS1, which
likely led to apoptosis in melanoma cells as observed in
pancreatic cancer cells [40]. The strong decrease of NOX4
and phospho-Akt levels at 96 h was concomitant with
an increase of Akt, consistent with a mutual regulation
of NOX4 and Akt [43]. In agreement with previous
data [41, 44], NOX4 inhibition paralleled with downregulation of p53, increase of cyclin D1 and associated
Cdk6. Additionally, Akt inhibition and associated strong
decrease of cyclin A (Figure 5B, [45]) could be linked
with translational control via PERK (-EIF2α) [46] with
an observed increase of PERK levels (data not shown)
and an increased susceptibility of tumor cells to cell
death. Thus, NS1 decrease of NOX4 expression suggested
several ways of (retro)control on NOX4 activity taking
place as revealed by NS1. Feedback loops on NOX
activation have been suggested to regulate growth and
differentiation of progenitor cells [47] and invoked in
propagating vascular damage to smooth muscle cells [48].
While NS1 significantly decreased ROS levels as observed
in HUVECs (Figure 3), the sensitivity of melanoma cells
to redox changes led to NS1-induced cell death in A375

a lack of toxicity toward melanocytes; Feedback
regulation(s) of VEGF-dependent NOX and crosstalk between NOX and eNOS?
Melanocytes are sensitive to ROS imbalance [22].
Oxidative stress contributes to angiogenesis and metastasis
involved in the development of tumors. In melanoma,
several signalling pathways promoted high ROS levels,
therefore melanoma cells established efficient antioxydant mechanisms to increase proliferation and avoid
cell death [33]. In melanoma A375 cells, NOX4 was highly
expressed compared to low levels in melanocytes (Figure
4C), as reported [27]. NOX4 is linked to proliferation:
in the endothelium, it promotes angiogenesis through
eNOS activation [24] and in melanoma, NOX4 converted
radial to vertical growth by overexpression of Akt [34].
In addition to NOX4, uncoupled eNOS and overexpressed
NOX1 also produced ROS in melanoma [25, 26], linked to
Epithelial–Mesenchymal Transition [35].
The growth of normal (primary) human melanocytes
was also unaffected by up to 200 µM NS1 (supplementary
Figure 1 and Figure 4B) and in these cells, the low
NOX4 levels were not modified by the addition of NS1.
NS1 decreased the growth of A375 melanoma cells in
a time and dose-dependent manner that we arbitrarily
divided into two time windows, early: 24 - 48h and late:
72 - 96 h (Figures 4 B and 5). At early times, treatment
of the melanoma cells with 30 µM NS1 induced a
decrease of VEGF levels and phospho-Erk (Figure
5A,C). This decrease suggested that NS1, through early
direct inhibition of membrane-bound e/nNOS and /or
NOX, inhibited the Erk pathway (Figure 5D). In these
conditions, L-NAME did not reduce VEGF and phosphoErk while DPI reduced both. The effects of NS1 on VEGF
and phospho-Erk compared with those induced by DPI
and L-NAME, taken together with ROS decrease, rather
suggested the involvement of NOX in NS1-mediated
effects at early times (Figure 3, [36-38]). The increase

Toward potential targeted therapeutics for
melanoma
Novel strategies against melanoma aiming at
exacerbation of ROS levels to induce DNA damage
and apoptosis have been proposed in combination with
inhibition of anti-oxidant enzymes (SOD, catalase and
redox transcription factors) [33]. Interestingly, opposite
strategies also led inhibiting cancer growth in vivo through
ROS (and NOX) inhibition [27, 49]. Currently, a few
efficient NOX inhibitors are available that prevented NOX
subunit assemblies but isoform-specific NOX inhibitors
are still missing [9, 23, 50]. Inhibition of nNOS by
isoform-selective compounds targeting the heme site were
the first compounds targeting NO that led to inhibition of
melanoma cells growth but with some cellular toxicity [51,
52]. Here we hypothesize that, by regulating more than one
signalling mediators as NO and ROS through VEGF, Akt

and NOX4, small targeted-molecules like NS1 may alter
redox fluxes between the tumor and its micro-environment
and possibly leading to “normalization” of tumor blood
vessels [38, 53] and reduction of angiogenesis/ metastasis.
NS1 decreased specifically NOX4 levels in melanoma and
not in healthy melanocytes; detailed mechanistic studies
are ongoing [54]. The lack of detection of high NO levels
by the Griess reagent suggested a minimal involvement
of iNOS in NS1 effect [29]. The molecular-targeted mode
of inhibition is unique to NS1 design mainly targeting
NADPH sites of constitutive NOS and possibly NOX [1114]. In conclusion, NS1 combined the ability of cellular
imaging eNOS in endothelial cells and pharmacological
effects allowing a specific decrease of redox stress, in
particular in metastatic melanoma that led to stop cell
growth. Further in vivo studies are required for testing the
potential therapeutic effects of NS1 or additional NADPH
derivatives with improved specificity.

of aliquots of nNOS (40-100 nM) and stopped after 10
min at 37°C by the addition of 6M HCl; 10 µL of 0.5 M
NH4SCN and 50 µL of 50 mM Fe(SO4) (freshly prepared)
were added to the mixture, the absorbance at 492 nm of
the ferric thiocyanate complex was read on a microplate
reader after 10 min. The H2O2 release was determined by
comparison with a calibration curve using known amounts
of H2O2 (0–25 μM); H2O2 concentration was determined
using ε240 nm = 39.4 M-1.cm-1 [58].
Superoxide anion formed by nNOS was detected
by spin-trapping with the cyclic nitrone DEPMPO and
EPR detection of the spin adducts. A typical incubation
mixture (final volume, 100 µL) contained 1 mM NADPH,
1.0 mM CaCl2, 10 µg/mL CaM, and 50 mM DEPMPO in
50 mM Hepes buffer pH 7.4. Five-10 µL of nNOS (final
concentration, 100-200 nM) were mixed with the previous
mixture that was rapidly transferred into an Aqua-X
sample cell fitted in a shq001 cavity of a X-band Bruker
EPR Elexsys 500 spectrometer (Bruker, Wissembourg,
France) maintained at 21°C and using the following
instrument settings: field modulation frequency, 100 kHz;
field modulation amplitude, 0.2 mT; time constant, 40.96
ms; microwave power, 10 mW; field width, 140 mT; center
field, 349 T; scan time, 41.94 s; number of scans, 16.
DEPMPO-OOH spectrum was identified by comparison
with incubations performed in the presence of xanthine/
xanthine oxidase. The changes in amplitude of the first
peak of the DEPMPO-OOH adduct were used to quantify
the amounts of superoxide generated in the experiments.

Cell culture and treatments
Endothelial (HUVECs) were cultured in P100
dishes or 96-well plates (104cells/well) at 37 °C
to ~95% confluence in Eagle’s Minimal Essential
Medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 5 mM
glutamine, penicillin–streptomycin (100 U/mL), 2.5 µg/
mL amphotericin, and 125 µg/mL gentamycin. Human
melanocyte suspensions were obtained from foreskins of
Caucasian children as previously described [59]. Human

Preparation of mouse isolated aorta

Measurements of superoxide anion production
from isolated aortic rings by EPR spectroscopy

Aorta rings were dissected from 15 weeks-old
male C57Bl/6J mice (Elevage Janvier, Le Genest-StIsle, France) anesthetized with ketamine/ xylazine before
sacrifice. All experimental procedures and protocols were
approved by the local Ethics Committee according to
National Care Regulations.

Superoxide anion formation was assayed by an EPR
method using the spin probe CAT1-H being a cell nonpermeable spin probe [62] with some modification: aortic
rings (about 1-mm length) were dissected from mouse
thoracic artery, preincubated on ice (1 hour) in KREBSDTPA-Hepes buffer (0.1 mM DTPA, 20 mM HEPES, pH
7.5) with or without NS1, catalase (100U / ml) or SOD
(100U/mL), and inserted into the capillary after addition
of 5 mM CAT1-H. The kinetics of EPR signals formation
of the CAT1● species were recorded on-line during 10
minutes at 37°C in capillary interposed into the cavity
of the EPR spectrometer (MiniScop MS400, Magnetech,
equipped with bio-temperature controller). The following
instrumental settings were used, modulation frequency,
100 kHz; microwave frequency, ~9.4 GHz; MP, 20 mW;
MA, 0.1 mT. The rates of aortic basal ROS formation were
calculated as a slope of linearized kinetic curve, obtained
from automatically recording of radical signal formation
(first hf component) using Magnettech kinetic software,
and normalized by the length of aortic rings or protein
content after subtraction of the basal signal (without aortic
rings). Preincubation of aortic rings with SOD (100U/ml,
30 minutes on ice) decreased EPR signal accumulation
by 80%. CAT1-H reaction with DPI ruled out the use of
DPI to test the role of NOX in NS1-induced decrease of
superoxide ion.

Cell viability tests
Serial dilutions of NS1 (1µM – 100 µM) were added
to the HUVEC that were further incubated at 37°C for up
to 24 or 48 hours. The cell supernatants were removed and
replaced by fresh medium before MTT analysis. At the
chosen time, 20 µL of 5 mg/mL MTT in PBS was added
to the cells and further incubated at 37 °C. After washing,
100 µL of DMSO were added in each well and absorbance
at 570 nm was measured on a multi-well Plate Reader
(Model VICTORTM X4, PerkinElmer) with subtraction
of blank value at 630 nm. In additional experiments,
HUVECs growth cultured in the presence or absence of
NS1 was recorded by videomicroscopy using an Axiocam
camera.

Cell viability of MHN and melanoma cells
For the study of the differential effect of NS1 on
melanocytes and melanoma A375 cells, viable cells
were counted using trypan blue dye exclusion method as
previously described [54].

Fluorescence detection of ROS generation
CellROX® Deep Red Reagent (Invitrogen) was
used for oxidative stress detection (absorption and
emission maxima at ~644/665 nm). HUVECs (1-1.5x105
cells) plated in 12-well plates at ~85% confluence were
pre-incubated with increasing concentrations of NS1
for 30 min at 37°C, and then further incubated with 2
µM CellROX® Deep Red Reagent for 30 min. Tertbutyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) (Sigma), an oxidative
stress inducer, was used as a positive control. After
centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 5 min, the cell pellets
were resuspended in PBS containing 30% of enzyme-free
Cell Dissociation Buffer (Gibco®) and analysed by FACS
Calibur flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson). To address
the modulation effect of NS1 on ROS formation, the MFI
(Mean Fluorescence Intensity) related to fluorescence
emission of the CellROX® Deep Red Reagent, detected
in FL-4 channel and measured in the presence of a
given concentration of NS1, was normalized by the MFI
obtained in the absence of NS1 (i.e. CellROX® Deep Red
Reagent alone; also measured in FL-4 channel), giving the
fluorescence enhancement factor. Similar measurements
were performed in A375 melanoma cells.

Measurements of nitric oxide production from
isolated aortic rings in situ by spin trapping
and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR)
spectroscopy
Production of NO was assayed by spin trapping
in presence of the spin trap ([FeII-(DETC)2] and EPR
detection of the FeII(DETC)2NO paramagnetic NO adduct
by EPR spectroscopy. Isolated aortic rings were incubated
in KREBS-Hepes buffer in the presence of NS1 or vehicle
alone (1h at 37°C) and stimulated or not during 30 minutes
with calcium ionophore (A23187, 2 µM or ionomycin,
2 µM) at 37°C [61]. The EPR signal of the [FeIINO(DETC)2] complex (g1 = 2.035; Ahfs = 1.3 mT) was
recorded on a Bruker EMX100 spectrometer spectrometer
(X-band, microwave frequency ~9.35 GHz, modulation
frequency, 100 kHz) with following settings: microwave
power (MP), 20 mW; modulation amplitude (MA), 0.5
mT; time constant (TC) 163 ms; 10 scans, 77°K.
