BACKGROUND. Leukemias are dependent on Akt/NF-jB activation and angiogenesis.

METHODS. The antiangiogenic Akt/NF-jB inhibitor xanthohumol (XN) has in
vitro activity against acute and chronic myelogenous leukemia cell lines (AML,
CML) and fresh samples from patients were investigated.

RESULTS. Inhibition of cell proliferation is associated with induction of apoptosis
and reduced VEGF secretion. Decreased cell invasion, metalloprotease production, and adhesion to endothelial cells observed in the presence of XN could prevent in vivo life-threatening complications of leukostasis and tissue infiltration.

CONCLUSIONS. As endothelial cells and hematopoietic cells are mutually corre-

ngiogenesis has been associated with the growth, dissemination,
and metastasis of solid tumors and increased levels of angiogenic molecules have been correlated with poor prognosis in several
solid tumors. In recent studies, increased microvessel density in
areas of intense neovascularization was a significant and independent prognostic indicator in early-stage breast, prostate, gastrointestinal, ovarian, and melanoma cancers. Increased vascularity was also
reported in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and appeared to be independent of
cellularity and associated with a significant increase in angiogenic
factors,1 suggesting that vascularity in hematologic malignancies is
an active and controlled process and may play a role in the leukemogenic process. The successful use of arsenic trioxide and thalidomide in the treatment of hematologic malignancies has been, in
part, associated with their antiangiogenic properties. Xanthohumol
(XN), the principal flavonoid of the hop plant (Humulus lupulus
L.), has cancer chemopreventive activities.2,3 We have demonstrated that XN has antiangiogenic properties in vitro and in vivo4
associated with blockage of Akt/NF-jB activation. As endothelial
cells and hematopoietic cells are mutually correlated in their development and growth, here we investigated the effects of XN on
leukemia cells. Our results identify new signaling pathways targeted by XN and suggest potential therapeutic utility in leukemia
patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents
XN was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San
Diego, Calif), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) assays for NF-jB activity were performed
using a commercially available kit (TransAM, Active
Motif, Carlsbad, Calif). Vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) protein released into the media by cell
lines and clinical samples was measured using a
commercial ELISA kit (LISTARFISH; CYTImmune
Sciences, College Park, Md).

Cells
U937 CML and human umbilical vein endothelial
(HUVE) cells were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, Md). MM6 AML
cells were kindly provided by Prof. Mingari of our
institute and cultured under standard conditions.
Mononuclear cells from peripheral blood of healthy
donors or CML and AML patients at diagnosis after
receiving informed consent were isolated following
established procedures5 and cultured in RPMI in the
presence of 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum
(FBS) and 20 ng/mL human granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (hGM-CSF). Clonogenic
assays were conducted on normal bone marrow progenitors6 to evaluate XN cytotoxicity.

Cell Proliferation, Apoptosis, Invasion, Gelatin
Zymography, and Adhesion Assay
The number of viable cells was measured by the
MTT test at different timepoints. A cell death detection ELISA kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) was
used to measure apoptosis after XN treatment. Chemoinvasion was carried out in BioCoat Matrigel invasion chambers (BD Biosciences, Bedford, Mass)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. Gelatin
zymography and adhesion to endothelial cells were
carried out as described previously.4,7 Cell surface
aminopeptidase (CD13/APN) activity was measured
after incubating the cells with various concentrations
of XN for 4, 12, 16, and 24 hours in complete medium. Cells (40,000 per well) were washed thrice
withphosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated
1 hour at 378C with 2 mL of 100 mM L-alanine-4
methyl-7-coumarinylamide trifluoroacetate (Fluka,
Milan, Italy) in 10 mM HEPES-buffered PBS (pH 7.2)
containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The development of the fluorescent product was measured with
a fluorimetric plate reader (excitation wavelength,
360 nm; emission wavelength, 465 nm).

Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysis
To test the activation of the Akt and NF-jB pathways,
MM6 and U937 cells were serum-starved for 16
hours and then treated with 5 lM XN for 6 hours in
serum-free medium. Five to 30 minutes before the
end of incubation cells were stimulated with TNF-a
(10 ng/mL). Cell pellets were lysed in RIPA buffer
containing protease inhibitors and equal amounts of
samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to
nitrocellulose, and probed at 48C overnight with the
following antihuman antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, Mass): rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473), anti-phospho p65(Ser539), antiphospho-IjB (Ser32). After washing, the blots were
incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies
(Amersham, Cologno Monzese, Italy) and specific
complexes were revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence solution (Amersham). An anti-GAPDH antibody
conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, Colo), or a mouse monoclonal anti-btubulin antibody (Sigma, Milano, Italy) were used as
loading controls for all samples.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Micromolar concentrations of XN dose-dependently
inhibited in vitro proliferation of MM6 and U937 cell
lines and fresh samples from AML and CML patients
(Fig. 1A-C). A notable apoptotic activity of XN was
also observed (Fig. 1A-C). To assess the safety of
XN on human bone marrow progenitors, we tested
the compound in in vitro colony-forming-unit (CFU)
assay. At concentrations up to 5 lM, XN did not inhibit growth of bone marrow progenitors isolated
from healthy volunteers (data not shown). This is
consistent with the previously observed lack of apoptosis in endothelial cells treated with XN.4 Expansion of leukemic cell populations residing within the
bone marrow microenvironment involves adhesion
of leukemic cells to bone marrow extracellular matrix
(ECM) and migration/invasion into the surrounding
tissues. Kinase-dependent and -independent mechanisms contribute to the abnormal adhesion and
migration/invasion of hematopoietic progenitors.
Leukemic blast cells secrete MMP-2 and MMP-9,
which represent a marker for dissemination in myeloproliferative malignancies.8 XN significantly inhibited invasion of MM6 and U937 cell lines and patient
samples in vitro at concentrations as low as 2.5 lM
(Fig. 2A-C). Consistent with this, MMPs release was
also inhibited by XN (Fig. 2A-C). Another cell surface
metalloprotease, CD13/APN, expressed by myeloid
progenitors, monocytes, endothelial cells, and tumor

patients. Right panels (A,B): cell surface CD13/APN activity in MM6 and

cells has been associated with tumor cell invasion
and may be important in the regulation and signaling pathways that control myeloid growth and differentiation.9 CD13/APN activity was decreased in both
cell lines exposed to increasing concentrations of XN,
with an effect detectable after 4 hours (data not
shown) and statistically significant at 16 hours (Fig.
2A,B, right panels). Interestingly, the CD13/APN inhibitor bestatin induces growth inhibition and apoptosis in human leukemic cell lines10 and CD13
activity is down-regulated during differentiation of
HL60 induced by ATRA.9
Important features of AML and CML are the presence of an increased number of circulating progenitors and extramedullary hematopoiesis. This
promotes adhesion of leukemia cells to vascular endothelium and generates conditions favoring leukostasis and tissue infiltration.11 Leukemia cells labeled

with the fluorescent dye calcein showed a significantly reduced adherence to confluent endothelial

activation4 might further contribute to decrease the
inflammatory reactions causing multiple organ failure in leukemia patients.
Different reports demonstrated the constitutive
activation of NF-jB in lymphoid and myeloid malignancies, underscoring its implication in malignant
transformation.12 Overexpression of NF-jB may lead

to chemoresistance and inhibition of this pathway
may lead to successful therapy. The phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway is also crucial
to many aspects of cell growth, survival, and apoptosis, and its constitutive activation has been implicated in both the pathogenesis and the progression
of a variety of neoplasms, including leukemias.13 Evidence accumulated over the recent years has indicated the PI3K/Akt signal transduction pathway as a
major one responsible for cancer resistance to conventional therapies. Indeed, pharmacologic inhibitors
of PI3K/Akt potentiate the apoptotic action of antileukemic drugs.14 Simultaneous activation of multiple
signal transduction pathways confers poor prognosis
in AML,15 therefore targeting NF-jB activation, as
well as its upstream regulator Akt might constitute
an additional strategy to improve conventional therapies. We previously reported that NF-jB and Akt are
targets of XN in endothelial cells.4 Because blockade
of NF-jB is usually associated with suppression of
invasion and metalloproteinase production,16 we
examined whether XN could affect Akt/NF-jB activation in leukemia cells. Treatment of MM6 (Fig. 3A)
and U937 (Fig. 3B) cells for 5, 15, or 30 minutes with
10 ng/mL TNF-a produced a strong NF-jB activation, as detected by ELISA assay. Preincubation for
6 hours in the presence of 5 lM XN significantly
inhibited this TNF-a-induced NF-jB activation (Fig.
3A,C; *P < .05, **P < .01, 2-tailed t-test). Western blot
analysis (Fig. 3B,D, MM6 and U937, respectively)
confirmed that XN significantly represses the levels
of nuclear phosphorylated p65, as well as the levels
of cytosolic phosphorylated IjBa, after stimulation
with TNF-a. These data indicate an inhibitory activity at or upstream of protein kinase IKK, which phosphorylates IjBa, suggesting that XN is able to
interfere with the signaling pathways leading to NFjB activation. Under the same conditions, XN also
inhibited Akt phosphorylation.
Leukemias are angiogenesis-dependent malignancies1,17 and angiogenesis is strictly dependent on
Akt/NF-jB activation. VEGF release by leukemic
blasts may be an important stimulus for angiogenesis
in the bone marrow as, in CML, overexpression of
VEGF and increased angiogenesis are consistent findings1 and a prognostic significance of VEGF expression in chronic phase CML has been proposed.18
Moreover, in the NOD/SCID mouse model efficiency
and speed of engraftment of myeloid and lymphoid
human leukemias correlate with VEGF production.19
Because we recently demonstrated an antiangiogenic
activity of XN4 and VEGF production correlates with
Akt activation,20 we tested whether XN could also
affect VEGF secretion. Sixteen hours of exposure to

shown (*P < .05, **P < .01 with respect to control, 2-tailed t-test). (B,D)
Western blot analysis shows that XN repressed nuclear phosphorylated-p65
as well as -cytosolic IjBa and -Akt levels in MM6 and U937 cells, respectively, after stimulation with TNF-a. As a control for loading, the same blots
were reprobed with anti-GAPDH and -b-tubulin antibodies. (E) ELISA analysis
for VEGF showed that 16 hours exposure to XN reduced the amount of
secreted VEGF. Means  SEM are shown (*P < .05, **P < .01 with respect
to control, 2-tailed t-test). Similar results were obtained after treatment of
fresh leukemia from chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients.

increasing concentrations of XN significantly reduced
VEGF levels in both cell lines and clinical samples to
about 50% of control values (Fig. 3E, *P <.05, **P <.01,
2-tailed t-test). Because the endothelium is quite
sensitive to VEGF exposure, the reduction in VEGF
production observed may be physiologically significant. Another intriguing aspect of VEGF-driven
angiogenesis in hematologic neoplasia is the finding
that VEGF-stimulated endothelial cells produce stem
cell factor, granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and interleukin 6. These cytokines, in
turn, may act as growth factors for myeloid and
lymphoid malignant cells, thus generating a paracrine machinery between hematopoietic malignant
cells and newly generated endothelium. In this sce-

nario, XN could inhibit the angiogenic process
through decreasing VEGF secretion in leukemic cells
and also through inhibiting endothelial cell activities,
causing the interruption of a reciprocal stimulatory
loop between leukemic and endothelial cells.
Collectively, these findings generate a rationale
for investigating the clinical efficacy of XN: 1) It
shows direct4 and indirect antiangiogenic properties;
and 2) It directly induces tumor cell apoptosis, suggesting that a combination of direct toxicity against
leukemia cells with antiangiogenic activity could
potently improve therapeutic efficacy and potentially
repress acquisition of resistance.
