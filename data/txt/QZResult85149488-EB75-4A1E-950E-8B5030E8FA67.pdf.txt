ABSTRACT:
NF-кB has been linked to doxorubicin resistance in breast cancer patients. NFкB nuclear translocation and DNA binding in doxorubicin treated-breast cancer cells
have been extensively examined; however its functional relevance at transcriptional
level on NF-кB -dependent genes and the biological consequences are unclear. We
studied NF-кB -dependent gene expression induced by doxorubicin in breast cancer
cells and fresh human cancer specimens with different genetic backgrounds focusing
on their p53 status.
NF-кB –dependent signature of doxorubicin was identified by gene expression
microarrays in breast cancer cells treated with doxorubicin and the IKKβ-inhibitor
MLN120B, and confirmed ex vivo in human cancer samples. The association with p53
was functionally validated. Finally, NF-кB activation and p53 status was determined
in a cohort of breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant doxorubicin-based
chemotherapy.
Doxorubicin treatment in the p53-mutated MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in NF NFкB driven-gene transcription signature. Modulation of genes related with invasion,
metastasis and chemoresistance (ICAM-1, CXCL1, TNFAIP3, IL8) were confirmed in
additional doxorubicin-treated cell lines and fresh primary human breast tumors. In
both systems, p53-deficient background correlated with the activation of the NF-кB
–dependent signature. Furthermore, restoration of p53WT in the mutant p53 MDAMB-231 cells impaired NF-кB driven transcription induced by doxorubicin. Moreover, a
p53 deficient background and nuclear NF-кB /p65 in breast cancer patients correlated
with reduced disease free-survival.
This study supports that p53 deficiency is necessary for a doxorubicin driven
NF-кB -response that limits doxorubicin cytotoxicity in breast cancer and is linked to
an aggressive clinical behavior.

INTRODUCTION

RESULTS

Doxorubicin, an anthracycline commonly used to
treat breast cancer, inhibits topoisomerase II enzyme,
resulting in DNA damage that leads to apoptosis [1].
However, DNA damage induced by doxorubicin can
also switch on the transcription factors p53 [2] and
the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-кB), limiting drug
cytotoxicity. NF-кB has five subunits: p65, p50, p52,
c-Rel and RelB [3], that can form dimers. They are
inactive in the cytoplasm in complex with inhibitory
IкBs proteins. Once in the nucleus, NF-кB binds to the
DNA кB sites, in the promoter or enhancer of its target
genes. NF-кB dimers have distinct binding sites [4] and
are modified post-translationally to recruit co-activators
to activate transcription of genes participating in key
cellular processes [5]. The combinatorial diversity of NFкB dimers, postranslational modifications and association
with transcriptional regulators contributes to the regulation
of distinct, but sometimes overlapping sets of genes upon
specific stimuli [6]. Two kinase subunits, IKKβ and IKKα,
and a regulatory IKKγ (NEMO), constitute the IkappaB
kinase complex (IKK) necessary for IкB phosphorylation
and NF-кB activation. We have used in this study the
IKKβ inhibitor MLN120B [7].
We have shown previously that doxorubicin activates
NF-кB in BT474 breast cancer cells and pharmacological
inhibition of NF-кB enhanced its antitumoral effects [8].
Similar results have been achieved by others [9, 10]. From
a clinical perspective, we have showed that nuclear NF-кB
/p65, as a surrogate marker of activation, correlated with
resistance to anthracycline-based chemotherapy and worse
outcome [11]. Furthermore, p65 activation was increased
after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer in
residual disease [12]. Other studies have reported similar
findings in breast cancer and other tumor types [13, 14].
It is now widely accepted that transcriptional
induction of anti-apoptotic and prosurvival genes by
NF-кB contributes to cancer cell chemoresistance, thus
reinforcing the concept of targeting NF-кB in anticancer
therapies [15]. However, recent reports have suggested
that NF-кB activity in response to anthracyclines can also
play pro-apoptotic functions. Specifically, daunorubicin
suppresses the transcription of bcl-xL by NF-кB activation
in osteosarcoma cells and doxorubicin represses NF-кB
anti-apoptotic genes in breast cancer cells [16]. In this
study, we aimed to gain further insight in NF-кB- regulated
gene expression in response to doxorubicin treatment to
clarify its functional importance in chemoresistance in
breast cancer.

Doxorubicin induces the expression of metastasis
related genes through NF-кB activation in MDAMB-231 breast cancer cells.
Consistently with our previous findings in other
cancer cells [8], doxorubicin induced IкBα degradation,
p65 nuclear localization and increased NF-кB -DNA
binding in the triple negative MDA-MB-231 cells. These
effects were prevented by MLN120B, a specific inhibitor
of the kinase IKKβ (Fig. 1A, 1B and 1C). NF-кB subunit
composition was determined by ELISA-based assay of
nuclear extracts showing a significant p65 and p50 binding
to DNA induced by doxorubicin compared to control and
these effects were prevented by MLN120B (Fig. 1D). The
DNA-binding ability of the other NF-кB subunits was
unaltered following doxorubicin treatment.
Previously published reports showed controversial
data regarding the ability of doxorubicin-induced DNAbound NF-кB to activate specific gene transcription.
To clarify this issue, we used stably transfected MDAMB-231 cells carrying a luciferase reporter gene under the
control of NF-кB responsive elements (MDAMB231/kBLuc cells). In these cells, doxorubicin exposure resulted
in an increase of NF-кB regulated luciferase activity that
was prevented by IKKβ inhibition (Fig. 1E). This result
indicates that NF-кB induced by doxorubicin is overall
transcriptionally active.
Next, we performed a microarray gene expression
study to investigate the possibility that doxorubicin
modulates the expression of specific NF-кB target genes.
Upon 4 hours of doxorubicin exposure, more than 300
genes were differentially modulated in MDA-MB-231
compared with control cells (GEO accession number:
#16789213) (Fig. 1F). Among them, a set of 12 genes was
partially reverted to basal levels by adding MLN120B
(Fig. 1F and Table S1). However, no significant differences
were observed between MLN120B treated and control
cells in the absence of doxorubicin.

Transcriptional responses of doxorubicin-induced
NF-кB activation varies among breast cancer
cells.
Next, we independently tested by qRT-PCR four
candidate genes selected from microarray data that
were upregulated by doxorubicin and whose activation
was prevented by MLN120B (CXCL1, IL8, ICAM1 and
TNFAIP3). These genes were selected because of their
relevance in cell adhesion and migration (IL-8, ICAM-1),
chemotherapy resistance (CXCL-1) and negative NF-кB
regulation (TNFAIP3). In accordance with microarray
data, the four genes were upregulated in doxorubicin197

treated MDA-MB-231 cells and MLN120B pretreatment
efficiently prevented their upregulation (Fig. 2A). Of
note, in contrast with the array experiments where we
did not detect expression changes in MLN120B treated
cells compared with control, by qRT-PCR we observed
significant differences between MLN120B treated and
control samples in the absence of doxorubicin exposure

activation of NF-кB occurred in other phenotypically
different breast cancer cell lines, we treated with
doxorubicin the HER2-overexpressing SKBR3 and
BT-474 and the ER-positive MCF-7 cells. Doxorubicin
induced p65 nuclear translocation in all cell lines as shown
by western blot and immunofluorescence (Supplementary

regulated gene products in breast tumors ex vivo.

doxorubicin induced NF-кB transcriptional activation as
indicated by the upregulation of IL8, ICAM1, CXCL1 and
TNFAIP3 genes that was prevented by MLN120B (Fig.
2B). However, gene expression induction of IL8, ICAM1,
and TNFAIP3 by doxorubicin was not observed in MCF-7
cells. CXCL1 gene was not detectable at basal conditions
and was excluded in the analysis. We then analyzed the
modulation at protein level of ICAM-1. An increase of
ICAM-1 expression in MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3 cells
under doxorubicin treatment, which was prevented by
IKKβ inhibition, was demonstrated by western blot (Fig.
2C), although results on ICAM-1 in BT-474 were nonconclusive (data not shown). According with the gene
expression results, ICAM-1 protein levels did not increase
after doxorubicin exposure in MCF-7 cells.
Overall, these results indicate that doxorubicin
induced NF-кB nuclear translocation in all tested
breast cancer cells, but they showed a differential NFкB transcriptional response probably reflecting their
differences at the genetic background.

We next assayed whether the effects of doxorubicin
on NF-кB that we observed in vitro also occurred in
human breast cancer. For that, we exposed a panel of 20
freshly isolated human tumors ex vivo to doxorubicin and
MLN120B alone or combined [17]. In control conditions,
p65 and p50 were mainly detected in the cytoplasm. After
doxorubicin treatment, both NF-кB proteins translocated
to the nucleus of tumor cells. Moreover, doxorubicininduced nuclear accumulation of p65 and p50 subunits
was efficiently prevented by MLN120B (Fig. 3A and
3B). These findings were corroborated in an independent
series of 36 breast tumors, which were treated ex vivo with
doxorubicin (data not shown).
Next, we evaluated whether p65 and p50 nuclear
translocation in doxorubicin-treated tumor specimens
was associated with an increase in the expression of NF-

which produced a significant downregulation of ICAM1, TNFAIP3 and CXCL-1 expression (p=0.001, 0.013

that doxorubicin treatment ex vivo significantly increased

result in activation of target genes. On the contrary, in the
mutant p53 MDA-MB-231, SKBR3 and BT-474 cells,
NF-кB target genes were activated by doxorubicin. So,
we hypothesized that p53 status may be associated with
different NF-кB responses upon doxorubicin treatment.
In ex vivo experiments using fresh human breast cancer,
p53 mutation was indirectly assayed by its nuclear
accumulation in tumor cells by IHC [20]. We found
that NF-кB target gene activation by doxorubicin was
significantly associated with p53 nuclear accumulation
(Fig. 4a). Specifically, expression of tested NF-кB target
genes was significantly increased by doxorubicin in all
p53 deficient tumors (n=5) (p=0.035 for ICAM-1, p=0.050
for TNFAIP3 and p=0.014 for CXCL-1), but not in p53
wild type tumors (n=8) (p=0.244 for ICAM-1, p=0.908
for TNFAIP3 and p=0.428 for CXCL-1) (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). These results were confirmed in an independent
set of samples that were treated with doxorubicin alone
(Supplementary Fig. S2B). ICAM-1 expression was
significantly increased by doxorubicin in p53-deficient
tumors (p=0.005) and this increase was prevented by
MLN120B (p=0.005), whereas this effect was not
observed in p53 wild type cases (p=1.000) (Fig. 4B).
Interestingly, p53-dependance in NF-кB target
gene expression induced by doxorubicin was also
observed in WT and p53KO MEFs (Fig. 4C). We found
that p53KO but not WT MEFs significantly increased
ICAM-1 mRNA levels through NF-кB activation
in response to doxorubicin treatment (p=0.012 and
p=0.676, respectively). Importantly, MLN120B induced
downregulation of ICAM-1 only in p53KO cells (p=0.011).
To confirm that p53 was the responsible of
impairing NF-кB transcriptional activity induced by
doxorubicin in breast, we knocked down p53 expression

using two different shRNA in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4D).
Both shRNA (shTP53.1 and shTP53.2) decreased p53
mRNA expression and avoided an efficient induced
expression of the p53 protein after doxorubicin treatment,
as observed in the cells expressing the shRNA control
(shCT). Unexpectedly, no differences were detected in
ICAM-1 and TNFAIP3 mRNA levels between CT and p53
knocked down cells when treated with doxorubicin (Fig.
4E). On the contrary, overexpression of p53WT in the p53
mutant cells MDA-MB-231 using pCDNA3flagp53 (Fig.
4F) prevented doxorubicin-mediated induction of NF-кB
target genes (Fig. 4G), and effect was maintained in cells
transfected with the control vector.
These results confirm that p53 null status seems
to be necessary for doxorubicin to activate NF-кB
-dependent transcription in breast cancer cells both in vitro
and ex vivo, although other factors might be limiting NFкB response to DNA damage.

Nuclear p65 expression and p53 deficiency are
associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer
patients.
Finally, we tested whether the presence of nuclear
p65 and nuclear p53, as a surrogate of p53 inactivation, in
breast tumors predicted differences in outcome. In a cohort
of 335 early breast cancer patients, nuclear accumulation
of p53 was observed in 85 (25.4%) patients, and nuclear
p65 in 118 (35.2%) of cases (Supplementary Table S2).
Detection of nuclear p65 significantly only
correlated with relapse of the disease (30.5% of cases
with nuclear p65 vs. 15.2% without expression of nuclear
p65; p=0.001). Nuclear p53 was associated with high

In addition, detection of nuclear p65 significantly
correlated with the nuclear accumulation of p53 in these
tumors (p=0.003). Nuclear p65 and p53 co-localization
was found in 42 (12.5%) of the studied patients and was
associated with high tumor grade (52.4% in cases with

Finally, DFS analysis showed a higher risk of
relapse in breast cancer patients with nuclear accumulation
of p53 and p65 in tumor cells (p=0.001). The hazard ratio
for relapse in patients with nuclear p65 and p53 tumors
was 2.49 (IC 95%; 1.42-4.37) (Fig. 5) (Table 1). KaplanMeier curves for relapse and log-rank test comparisons
also showed that tumor size (p=0.001), grade (p=0.022),

(p=0.004) and p65 nuclear expression (p=0.002) were
associated with the risk of relapse (Table 1).
A multivariate analysis was performed including
all the significant clinico-pathological factors (Table 1).
Nuclear co-localization of p65 and p53 retained its adverse
prognostic role for relapse (P<0.009). The hazard ratio
for relapse in patients with tumors with accumulation
of nuclear p65 and p53 was 2.64 (IC 95%; 1.27-5.49).
Another independent prognostic factor for DFS was lymph
node involvement (p=0.048).
These results indicate that the p53 status in breast
cancer tumors predicts the NF-кB -dependent transcription
of genes in response to doxorubicin.

MDA-MB231, BT-474 and SKBR3 cells, but not in wildtype p53 MCF-7 cancer cells. The correlation between p53
status and the ability of doxorubicin to elicit a tumorigenic
and anti-apoptotic NF-кB response was also observed in
a large panel of fresh human breast tumors ex vivo treated
with doxorubicin. In addition, our studies using genetic
manipulation have demonstrated the direct role of p53 in
the NF-кB response to doxorubicin.
After DNA damage, the sequential molecular
events that culminate in the p65/p50 nuclear localization
and DNA-binding activity of NF-кB are widely accepted
[3, 22]. However, it remains uncertain whether the
NF-кB activated by doxorubicin and other related
chemotherapeutic agents elicit a transcriptomic response.
Several studies have shown that after causing DNAbinding, doxorubicin will induce NF-кB transcriptional
events and lead to the production of antiapoptotic gene
products that can contribute to chemoresistance [23].
Indeed, doxorubicin can stimulate the expression of
prosurvival NF-кB genes, like BCLl-XL, a member of
the Bcl-2 family in cancer cells [24]. In breast cancer,
NF-кB has been assigned as a pro-apoptotic pathway
through repression of anti-apoptotic genes in response
to doxorubicin [25], and in other reports, doxorubicininduced nuclear p65 cannot be phosphorylated and
acetylated and, therefore, its DNA binding affinity and
transcriptional activity is reduced [16]. Anthracyclineinduced DNA-binding activity of NF-кB in osteosarcoma
has been dually described as activator and repressor of
antiapoptotic genes. It is proposed that DNA-intercalation
agents would activate a repressive NF-кB complex
while those that do not intercalate DNA would induce
an active NF-кB complex [26]. Therefore, most of the
studies conclude that NF-кB activated by DNA damage
may activate or repress genes depending on tumor type,
context and environmental conditions. In fact, the Ser536
phosphorylation of p65 has been proposed as a marker
for transcriptionally activation or repression of NF-кB
by doxorubicin, respectively [21]. In our work, we found
that NF-кB induced the expression of CXCL1, ICAM1 and
TNFAIP3 after doxorubicin treatment only in a subset of
tumors, suggesting that differences in responses may exist
among tumor subtypes.
We selected different genes to confirm our
microarray data based on the relevance in chemoresistance
and metastatasis. The TNFAIP3 gene, also known as A20,
is a deubiquitinating enzyme and a negative regulator
of NF-кB [27]. Its overexpression is associated to
aggressiveness of nasopharyngeal [28] and breast [29]
cancer and also with the development of resistance to
O6-alkylating agents in glioblastoma [30], and tamoxifen
resistance [29]. ICAM-1 is a surface transmembrane
glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin
superfamily of adhesion molecules and plays a role in
immune response, but also is involved in mechanisms of
invasion and metastasis in breast cancer [31]. ICAM-1

DISCUSSION
The DNA-binding activity and transcriptional
activation of NF-кB after doxorubicin treatment is
still under debate [16, 21]. In this work we show
that doxorubicin induces, through NF-кB activation,
a transcriptome compatible with metastasis and
chemoresistance exclusively in a p53-deficient cell
context. Moreover, deficient p53 status and nuclear
NF-кB correlated with worse outcome of breast cancer
patients. Doxorubicin is able to promote NF-кB
translocation, DNA binding and upregulation of NF-кB
dependent transcription leading to expression of a NF-кBdependent transcriptome associated with tumor growth,
migration, metastasis and chemoresistance in mutant p53

expression has been correlated with progression, prognosis
and aggressive phenotype in cancer [32, 33]. Moreover,
and in agreement with our results, increased plasma
levels were observed in doxorubicin-treated breast cancer
patients [34]. The other selected gene was the chemokine
CXCL-1, which promotes chemotaxis in different cell
types such as stromal-epithelial and host-tumor cells, and
consistently, is involved in metastasis, tumor progression
and chemotherapy resistance and survival [35]. In vivo
downmodulation of CXCL-1 reduces the metastatic
potential in MDA-MB-231 and enhanced anti-tumor
effects of chemotherapy [36]. Thus, according to these
data and our own results, doxorubicin-induced NF-кB
activation in a p53 deficient background might favor the
acquisition of a metastatic phenotype of breast cancer, and
residual cells after treatment would be more aggressive
resulting in tumor promotion to dissemination.
DNA damage induces stabilization of tumor
suppressor p53 and could eventually lead to cell cycle
arrest, senescence or apoptosis [37]. An antagonistic
crosstalk between p53 and NF-кB networks has been
described because directly compete for binding to the
transcriptional co-activator CBP/p300 by regulation of
IKKα phosphorylation [38]. According to that, it has
been shown that NF-кB inhibition by curcumin enhances
chemotherapy efficacy by favoring induction of p53-p300
dependent apoptosis in breast cancer [39].
Our results showed that mutated p53 mediated the
induction of transcription of NF-кB regulated genes by
doxorubicin and functional restoration of wild-type p53
impaired doxorubicin- NF-кB dependent transcription
in breast cancer. Similarly, mutant p53 increases NF-кB
transcriptional activity induced by TNFα and knocking
down mutant p53 reduced NF-кB activity. However,
when we knocked down wild type p53 in the MCF-7
cells, NF-кB target gene expression upon doxorubicin
treatment did not change. This observation suggests
that other factors play a role in chemotherapy responses
and gene regulation. Indeed, the ER, which is expressed
in MCF-7 and in two-thirds of breast cancers [40], has
also been associated with NF-кB activity. Breast cancer
cells expressing ER contain lower NF-кB activity than
ER-negative cells [41]. Moreover, ectopic expression of
the receptor in ER-negative cells reduced NF-кB DNA
binding activity and expression of several NF-кB target
genes [42]. Thus, despite the requirement for further
functional studies combining both ER and p53 effects on
NF-кB activity, the ER status also determines the NF-кB
activity independently of p53.
In our series, nuclear accumulation of p53 protein,
as a marker of p53 deficiency [20], was associated with an
increase of NF-кB target genes in response to doxorubicin
ex vivo. p53 deficiency appears to be an independent
marker of poor prognosis and may influence chemotherapy
response in breast cancer [39]. A significant association of
co-expression of p53 and nuclear p65 with worse outcome
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

was found in our study. According to our hypothesis,
and considering that in multivariate analysis the nuclear
colocalization of p53 and p65, but not of each transcription
factor alone, retained its prognostic value, our results
strongly suggest that p53 mutant breast tumors are more
likely to relapse earlier to chemotherapy because of the
ability to activate NF-кB target genes. Furthermore, those
p53-deficient tumors with active NF-кB before treatment
will have fewer chances to benefit from therapy. In another
study of colorectal cancer, it has been observed that loss
of p53 during tumor progression is associated with an
NF-kB-dependent inflammatory microenvironment and
the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition [43].
In this study, NF-kB activation in p53 deficient tumors
was caused by bacterial products from the colonic mucosa,
and a role of NF-кB in the progression to metastasis was
clearly demonstrated. Also in head and neck lesions,
nuclear p65 and a novel NF-кB gene signature correlated
with mutant p53 status [44]. Also related to NF-кB and
p53 relationship, a recent publication shows that mutant
p53 prolongs NF-кB activation in colorectal cancer cells
[19].
In summary, we show that doxorubicin-driven
NF-кB transcription occurs in p53-deficient breast
tumors and specifically the expression of metastasis
and chemoresistance-associated genes. This NF-кB
response occurs in a high percentage of breast tumors,
therefore anthracyclines-based regimens in p53-deficient
breast tumors should be revisited. Based on our and
other results, incorporation of NF-кB inhibitors, such
as small molecules targeting the IKK complex or other
indirect NF-кB inhibitors (i.e. PARP inhibitors), should
be considered to avoid the expression of genes involved
in chemoresistance and relapse and, thus improving the
clinical benefit and the outcome of breast cancer patients.

METHODS
Cell lines and reagents
MDA-MB-231, BT-474, MCF-7 and SK-BR-3
human breast cancer cell lines were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured at
37ºC in 5% CO2. Wild-type murine embryonic fibroblast
(WT MEFs) and p53KO-MEFs were provided by Dr.
Yelamos (IMIM, Barcelona). All cells except MCF-7
were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 2mM
L-glutamine, penicillin (100units/ml), streptomycin
(100μg/ml) and 10% FBS. MCF-7 were grown in DMEM
with same supplements listed above. For BT-474, insulin
(0.01µg/ml) was added. Cells obtained from the ATCC
were tested via STR analysis by ATCC experts at the end
of experimental work. Doxorubicin (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
205

Oncotarget

Luciferase reporter assay

Louis, MO) was dissolved in deionized water at 10mM.
MLN120B was provided by Millennium Pharmaceuticals
(Cambridge, MA) and stored as a 10mM stock in DMSO
at -20ºC.

MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with a plasmid
encoding a luciferase reporter gene under a promoter
containing repeats consensus of NF-кB binding sites [45].
Cells (6x105 cells/well) were seeded in 12-well plates
and allowed to attach overnight. After serum starvation
for 24h, cells were incubated during 1.5h with 20µM
MLN120B and then with doxorubicin 5µM for 24h. Cells
were lysed and luciferase activity was measured using the
Dual-LuciferaseTM Reporter Assay System (Promega,
Madison, WI) following the manufacturer’s instructions
in 96-well plates by a luminometric reader (Thermo
Scientific, Nunc Brand, Lafayette, CO).

Immunofluorescence
Cells grown in 12-well plate preloaded with sterile
coverslips were treated, washed and fixed. Slides were
incubated for 1h at room temperature with primary
antibody (p65, sc-372) and incubated with Alexa
488-coupled secondary antibodies (Life Technologies,
Grand Island, NY) for 30min. Nuclei were counterstained
with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Abbott
Molecular, Abbott Park, IL). Cells were visualized under
fluorescence microscopy.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
Nuclear cell extracts were obtained as described
[45]. EMSAs were carried out with a specific NFκB consensus probe end-labeled with [γ-32P] ATP by
incubation with T4 polynucleotide kinase at 37ºC for
1h and purified in a G-50 spin column (Amersham
Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Extracts were incubated
with 1µL of the 32P-labeled probe and binding buffer
for 15min. DNA-protein complexes were separated from
unbound oligonucleotides in 8% polyacrylamide gels
using Tris/borate/EDTA. The specificity of DNA-protein
complexes were confirmed by competition with 100-fold
excess of unlabeled NF-κB-probe. After electrophoresis,
gels were fixed and then dried and exposed to X-ray film
at -80ºC.

RNA extraction for gene expression studiesα
Total RNA from cell lines was isolated using
RNeasy mini Kit (Qiagen, GMBH). Formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) breast tumor samples treated
ex vivo were subjected to standard deparaffinization prior
to and RNA extraction using RNeasy FFPE kit (Qiagen),
including an overnight proteinase K treatment and
RNase-free DNase I processing for 30min. RNA purity
and integrity were assessed both by spectrophotometry
(NanoDrop ND-1000, NanoDrop Technologies,
Wilmington, DE) and electrophoresis (2100 Bioanalyzer,
Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara CA) considering for
microarray experiments RNA purity, A260/280>2.0 and
A260/230>1.4 and RIN>9.4, as minimal requirements.

Microarray analysis

Western Blot

Microarray expression profiles were obtained
using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST
Array (Affymetrix Inc, Santa Clara, CA). Amplification,
labeling and hybridizations were performed according to
protocols from Ambion (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA) and Affymetrix. Briefly, 200ng of total RNA were
amplified using the Ambion WT Expression Kit (Applied
Biosystems), labeled using the WT Terminal Labeling Kit
(Affymetrix), and then hybridized to Human Exon 1.0 ST
Array for 16h at 45ºC in a GeneChip Hybridization Oven
640. Following hybridization, array was stained in the
Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 and scanned
using a GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.

Western blot was performed as previously described
[46], using anti-IкBα, anti-ICAM-1 and anti-p53 antibodies
(Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), anti- NF-кB p65 and
p50 (Santa Cruz Biotech, Dallas, TX) and anti-α-tubulin
antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) as loading control.

NF-κB DNA-binding ELISA-based assay
Nuclear extracts were obtained using the Nuclear
Extract Kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) DNA binding
activity of NF-кB was measured by an ELISA-based assay
using a TransAM NF-кB kit (Active Motif) following
manufacturer’s instructions. This assay detects binding of
p65, p50, p52, c-rel and Rel-B proteins to oligonucleotides
containing an NF-кB consensus-binding site immobilized
onto 96-well plates by specific primary antibodies that
recognized an epitope that is accessible only when NFκB is activated and bound to its target DNA, and was
quantified by spectrophotometry.

Gene expression profile analysis
After quality control of raw data, it was background
corrected, quantile-normalized and summarized to a genelevel using the robust multi-chip average (RMA) obtaining
a total of 18708 transcript clusters. Normalized data was
then filtered to avoid noise created by non-expressed

transcript clusters in the condition. Only transcripts with
an intensity signal of more than a 10% of all intensities
of the mean of studied groups and then over 50% of
variance from total resting variance were considered for
further analysis, which lead to 8535 transcript clusters.
Linear Models for Microarray (LIMMA), a moderated
t-statistics model, was used for detecting differentially
expressed genes between conditions. Correction for
multiple comparisons was performed using false discovery
rate and only genes with an adjusted p-value <0.05 were
selected as significant. For functional analysis purposes,
genes were selected to have a non-adjusted p-value <0.05.
Hierarchical cluster analysis was also performed. All
data analysis was performed in R v2.11.1 with packages
Aroma. Affymetrix, Biobase, Affy, LIMMA and genefilter.
Functional analysis was performed with Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis v9 (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City,
CA).

Transfection and infection

Real-Time Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)

Breast tissues were surgical resection specimens
from primary tumors obtained from Biobanks of Parc de
Salut Mar (MARBiobanc, Barcelona), Fundacion Jimenez
Diaz (BFJD, Madrid) and Valencia Clinic Hospital. FFPE
tumor specimens (N=126) were retrospectively selected
from consecutive breast cancers patients diagnosed
between 1998-2000, which had fulfilled the following
criteria; infiltrating carcinomas, operable disease, no
neoadjuvant therapy, enough available tissue and clinical
follow-up. Clinical data were collected from medical
clinical records by oncologists. TNM (Tumor, Node,
Metastasis) staging was classified using the American
Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system for
breast cancer. Histological grade was defined according
Scarff-Bloom-Richardson modified by Elston criteria
[47]. Estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR)
expression was determined by immunohistochemistry
(IHC) (SP1 and PgR636 clones, respectively, Dako,
Glopstrup, DK), establishing positivity criteria in ≥1% of
nuclear tumor staining, following ASCO/CAP guidelines
[48]. HER2 amplification was assayed by Fluorescence
in Situ Hybridization (FISH) (Pathvysion, Abbott
Molecular), following ASCO/CAP recommendations
[49]. Proliferation marker Ki-67 was studied by IHC
(MIB1 clone, Dako) and percentage of stained cells was
scored [50]. P53 expression was assayed by IHC (clone
DO-7, Dako). The study was approved by the Ethics
Committees of the three institutions. Tissue microarrays
(TMA) were constructed from representative areas of
each tumor including three 1mm tissue cores using a TMA
workstation (T1000 Chemicon) [46].
Additional 20 breast tumors, which were not needed
for diagnostic purposes, were obtained from surgical
specimens of patients newly diagnosed for invasive cancer
for the human breast tumor ex vivo models. Samples were
processed in sterile conditions immediately according
to our experience [46]. One slice (control sample) was

The vector pLKO1.puro was used for shRNA knock
down of p53 expression using two independent shRNA
sequences (TRCN0000003756, TRCN0000342259,
Sigma-Aldrich). HEK293T cells were transfected using
PEI reagent. After 24h, supernatant with lentiviral particles
was used to infect MCF-7 cells. Two days after infection
puromycin (2µg/ml) was added and surviving cells were
pooled to generate stable cell lines. pCDNA3flagp53 and
CT vector were purchased from Addgene (Cambridge,
MA) and were transfected into MDA-MB-231 cells using
lipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Sciences). Neomycin was
added to select transfected cells. Same protocol was used
to transfect the NF-кB luciferase reported plasmid [45].

Immunohistochemistry

REFERENCES

Tissue sections (3μm) placed on plus charged
glass slides. After deparaffinization, heat antigen
retrieval was performed in pH9 EDTA-based buffer
(Dako). Endogenous peroxidase was blocked and
slides were incubated with primary antibodies (p65; sc372, p50; sc-114, from SantaCruz; ICAM-1 from Cell
Signaling) for 60min, followed of appropriate anti-Ig
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polymer (Flex+,
Dako) using a Dako Autostainer, and visualized with
3,3’-diaminobenzidine. Sections incubated with nonimmunized serum were used as negative controls. As
positive control, breast tumors with a known expression
of markers were used.

Statistical analysis was carried out with SPSS
version 13.0 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL). To analyze
correlations between p65 and p50 expression and clinicopathological variables we used χ2 test (Fisher exact
test), based on bimodal distribution of data. Disease free
survival (DFS) was considered from date of surgery to
date of any primary, regional or distant recurrence of
the infiltrating carcinoma, as well as appearance of a
secondary tumor or death. Univariate analysis for DFS
curves were constructed based on Kaplan-Meier life-table
method and analyzed using log-rank test of equality across
strata; all predictors with P values lower than 0.05 were
used in multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional
hazards model. Analysis of experimental conditions
was done by paired T test. All the statistical tests were
conducted at two sided 0.05 level of significance. This
work was performed in accordance with Reporting
Recommendations for Tumor Marker Prognostic Studies
(REMARK) guidelines [51].
