Abstract
Cancer cells manage to divide in the context of gross chromosomal abnormalities. These abnormalities can
promote bypass of normal restraints on cell proliferation but at a cost of mitotic vulnerabilities that can be
attacked by chemotherapy. Determining how cancer cells balance these issues may permit chemotherapeutic
sensitivity to be leveraged more efficiently. From a pan-genomic small interfering RNA screen for modifiers of
chemoresponsiveness, we identified the tumor antigen acrosin binding protein (ACRBP)/OY-TES-1 as a specifier of paclitaxel resistance. ACRBP expression is normally restricted to the testes but is detected in a wide
variety of cancers, including most ovarian cancers. We found that ACRBP is both necessary and sufficient for
paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer cell lines and ovarian tumor explants. Moreover, high ACRBP expression correlated with reduced survival time and faster relapse among ovarian cancer patients. We identified the
mitotic spindle protein NuMA as an ACRBP-interacting protein that could account for the effects of ACRBP on
paclitaxel sensitivity. In cancer cells, ACRBP restricted a NuMA-dependent abrogation of a mitotic spindle
assembly that is otherwise pathologic. As a consequence, ACRBP depletion resulted in mitotic errors and reduced proliferative fitness that could be rescued by NuMA codepletion. We propose that the codependent
relationship of ACRBP and NuMA in cancer cells reflects their passage through a selection bottleneck during
tumor evolution, one which requires the acquisition of traits that normalize mitotic perturbations that originally drove the plasticity of a preneoplastic genome. The molecular definition of such traits as defined by the
ACRBP-NuMA complex may represent conceptually ideal intervention targets based on the wide therapeutic
windows they may offer. Cancer Res; 70(19); 7652–61. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Despite the widespread use as a chemotherapeutic intervention for cancer treatment, the molecular underpinnings
specifying tumor cell–selective sensitivity to microtubule poisons are enigmatic (1, 2). Whereas clinically effective, patient
responses are notoriously variable and associated with significant toxicity (3–7). From a pan-genomic small interfering
RNA (siRNA) screen for cell autonomous specifiers of chemoresponsiveness, we isolated a cohort of gene products that,
when depleted, significantly sensitized lung cancer cells to

paclitaxel-induced cell death (8). An intriguing subclass
of this cohort was previously recognized, through immunoreactive serum profiling, as encoding cancer testes tumor
antigens with no known function (9). A member of this subclass, acrosin binding protein (ACRBP; also known as OYTES-1; refs. 10–12), is normally expressed in developing and
adult testis and anomalously expressed in a variety of tumor
types, including lung, breast, and liver (13). Significantly, gain
of ACRBP/OY-TES-1 expression was reported in 69% of
ovarian tumors (12).
Given the extensive expression correlation with cancer, together with the robust functional interaction with chemotherapeutic agents, we directly examined the contribution
of ACRBP to the proliferative fitness of cancer cells. We found
that anomalous ACRBP expression was both required and
sufficient to support mitotic spindle assembly and function
in the face of microtubule perturbagens. The mechanistic basis of this contribution to robust mitotic progression is at
least in part through restriction of NuMA-dependent centrosomal fragmentation in cancer cells. The recapitulation of
this functional relationship in ovarian tumor explants and
the correlation of ACRBP expression with poor patient response to therapy suggest that ACRBP represents an acquired
dependency within the pathologic regulatory framework of
cancer cell mitosis.

ACRBP Supports Cancer Cell Spindle Assembly and Function

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
H1155 and ES-2 cells were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection. PEO1 and PEO4 cells were a gift
from Hani Gabra (University of Edinburgh Cancer Research
Center). H1155, PEO1, and PEO4 cell lines were validated by
Powerplex genotyping before use.
Tumor tissue and primary tumor explants
Normal ovarian tissue RNA samples were obtained with
consent from patients under IRB 092004-010 (University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Center Tissue Resource). Patient
ovarian tumor samples were isolated from ascites obtained
during surgical removal of tumors (LCOV2 and LCOV17) or
paracentesis (LCOV4) under appropriate HIPAA procedures
[IRB 09-0412 at University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel
Hill, “Identification of Linchpin Proteins Supporting Ovarian
Tumorigenesis”]. All numbers used to refer to samples are
dummy identifiers that cannot be traceable back to individual
patients. LCOV2 was derived from a patient with serous, stage
IIIC ovarian cancer who had received four cycles of paclitaxel
and carboplatin. LCOV4 was derived from a patient with primary peritoneal carcinosarcoma who had received three
cycles of ifosfamide/carboplatin, single-agent carboplatin,
Taxotere, and GEMZAR, followed by weekly paclitaxel.
LCOV17 was from a newly diagnosed patient with Stage IIIC
serous papillary ovarian cancer, who had not received prior
treatment. Ascites were plated in flasks, and medium was
changed weekly until cells were confluent. Cells were maintained in RPMI + 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; PEO1, PEO4,
and ES-2) or RPMI + 5% FBS (LCOV2, LCOV4, and LCOV17).
Live-cell imaging and quantitation
Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-histone H2B expressing
lines were produced by transduction with pCLNCX-GFPH2B retrovirus. Retrovirus was prepared by Fugene (Roche)
transfection of 293gp cells with pCLNCX-GFP-H2B and VSVG
according to the manufacturer's instructions. At 24 hours
posttransfection, the medium was replaced, and at 48 hours
posttransfection, supernatant was collected, centrifuged, and
filtered. H1155 cells were then transduced at 50% confluence
in conjunction with 4 μg/mL polybrene. At 1 day of posttransduction, the cells were selected with 600 μg/mL geneticin (Life
Technologies) until a homogenously expressing population
was obtained. For imaging of siRNA-treated cells, the H1155GFP-histone H2B line was reverse transfected as described
below and plated in a 96-well format followed by carrier or
paclitaxel treatment at 48 hours posttransfection. At 72 hours
posttransfection, imaging began on a BD Pathway 855 bioimager using a 40× objective. Images were collected at 15-minute
intervals for the next 48 hours. Image sequences were generated using ImageJ. Image sequences were then evaluated for
indicated parameters manually.
siRNA transfections
All transfections were performed with 50 nmol/L final concentration of siGENOME SMART pools and individual siRNA

oligonucleotides obtained from ThermoFisher. Reverse transfections were performed by mixing appropriate Dharmafect
(ThermoFisher) with siRNA pools and incubating for 20 minutes followed by delivery of trypsin-derived single-cell suspensions. Cells were transfected for a minimum of 72 hours
and a maximum of 96 hours before analysis, as indicated in
figure legends. To optimize cell lines, cells were reverse transfected with control (DLNB14) or a toxic siGENOME pool (targeting ubiquitin B) using a panel of Dharmafect reagents and
concentrations in 96-well format. At 96 hours posttransfection, cells were evaluated for viability using the Cell Titer
Glo Assay (Promega). ACRBP off-target validation was performed by using six individual siRNAs representing two independent siRNA pools obtained from Dharmacon (siGENOME
and ON-TARGETplus) in H1155 cells. Each individual siRNA
from the original pool and one from the ON-TARGETplus
pool effectively depleted ACRBP mRNA and resulted in
paclitaxel-dependent mitotic delay. The target sequences for
these siRNAs are GGAGAATACCTGCATCATATT, TGGAAGAGCTCCTACAATCTT, CCAAGAGAGTCCTGTGTTCTT,
GCCAAGGCCTGGAAGTACATT, and TTTACGGGCTGGATTTGTATT. In subsequent assays, the siGENOME pool
was used. An ACRBP depletion-induced phenotype was
also validated in PEO1 cells using a lentivirus-based system
(TRC clone set, OpenBiosystems catalog RHS4533). Clones
TRCN0000115843 and TRCN0000115844 were effective.
cDNA transient transfections
H1155 or PE01 cells were transfected with cDNA expression
vectors using Fugene according to the manufacturer's protocol for a 35 mm2 dish format. At 24 hours posttransfection,
medium was replaced with paclitaxel or vehicle-containing
medium for an additional 24-hour incubation. Cells were then
processed for immunofluorescence.
Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from tissue culture cells using the
Sigma RNA isolation kit. The high-capacity cDNA reverse
transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) was used to synthesize
cDNA from 3 μg of total RNA. Real-time reverse transcriptionPCR (RT-PCR) was performed on diluted cDNA using the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast real-time PCR system (standard
program) and inventoried TaqMan gene expression assays.
Human β-actin served as an endogenous control, and “control
transfected” was the calibrator for calculating differences in
expression levels using the 2-ΔΔCT method. Glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase was also used for normalization
in many cases and consistently returned the same biological
observation. Final results represent the pooling of two test experiments, and error bars represent average deviation from
the mean.
Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence
Monoclonal antibody raised in mouse against ACRBP was a
gift from Kunle Odunsi and is previously described. AntiNuMA rabbit antibody was obtained from Novus Biologicals.
A monoclonal antibody against bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd)
was obtained from Becton Dickinson. β-Tubulin III, γ-tubulin,

and Aurora-A antibodies were obtained from Sigma. Antipericentrin was obtained from Abcam. Alexa 488 and Alexa
546 (Invitrogen) were used as secondary antibodies for fluorescent labeling. Immunoblot assays were performed with
proteins transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane
according to the manufacturer's protocol for each antibody.
For BrdUrd visualization, cells were treated with 30 μmol/L
BrdUrd for 14 hours and then fixed in 3.7% HCHO. Cells were
permeabilized with acetone for 10 minutes at −20°C. DNA was
denatured with 1 mmol/L HCl for 10 minutes and then
blocked in PBS-5% bovine serum albumin-1% Tween for a
minimum of 15 minutes. Anti-BrdUrd was used at a dilution
of 1:4. For β-tubulin/pericentrin staining, cells were fixed as
described above, permeabilized for 10 minutes with 0.5% Triton
X-100, and blocked as above. Cells were stained with monoclonal β-tubulin III and pericentrin at a dilution of 1:100 or 1:200,
respectively, for 1 hour. Following extensive washes, an Alexa
488 or Alexa 546 secondary antibody was applied for 30 minutes
at 37°C. For γ-tubulin staining, cells were fixed as above and
permeabilized for 10 minutes in methanol at −20°C. For ACRBP
staining, cells were fixed and permeabilized as for β-tubulin,
and UA199 antibody was used at a 1:100 dilution. Cytokeratin16 staining was performed using a monoclonal cytokeratin-16
antibody obtained from Dako Laboratories. All cells were visualized with an Axiovert or Axioimager upright microscope
(Zeiss) equipped with a Hamamatsu or Zeiss CCD camera.
Immunoprecipitation
PEO4 cells grown to confluence on 100 mm2 dishes were
lysed in a buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 150 mmol/L

7654

NaCl, and 0.5% deoxycholate. Soluble lysate was incubated
overnight with anti-ACRBP monoclonal antibody UA199
or mouse IgG precoupled to cyanogen-bromide agarose
beads. Beads were washed three times in lysis buffer with
500 mmol/L NaCl. Following washes, sample buffer was
added, and lysates were boiled and separated by 10%
SDS-PAGE. High-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC)–mediated tandem mass spectroscopy of ACRBP
immunoprecipitates was performed by the University of
Texas Southwestern Protein Chemistry Core Research
Facility in Mass Spectrometry. Multiple peptides corresponding to NuMA were identified in a 180-kDa silverstained band.
Gene expression association studies
Fresh tumor was collected from 29 advanced epithelial
ovarian cancer patients between 2001 and 2006 as part
of an ongoing Early Detection Research Network collaboration. All patients were treated with taxane/platinum-based
chemotherapy. Specimens were immediately flash frozen
and stored at −80°C. The clinical course and outcome of
the patients were prospectively determined as sample collection was ongoing. Genomic mRNA expression profiles
were generated using the Affy Plus2 GeneChip. The robust
multiarray averaging method was used to process microarray data, and expression values were log2 transformed
(14, 15). Patients were dichotomized to high ACRBP and
low ACRBP groups based on a Gaussian mixture model
(16). ACRBP and NuMA expression values were used to
parse patient populations to high ACRBP-NuMA and low

ACRBP-NuMA groups based on a hierarchical clustering
analysis. Similar results are observed if median values were
used to dichotomize expression values. Disease-free survival time, defined as the time interval between chemotherapy conclusion and disease recurrence date or the last
follow-up date, was used to measure the patient's response
to chemotherapy. Survival curves were estimated using the
product limit method of Kaplan-Meier (17) and were compared using the log-rank test. Univariate cyclooxygenase
(COX) proportional hazards model was also performed,
with survival as the dependent variable (18).

Results
ACRBP copy number is amplified in tumors and
confers paclitaxel resistance
The mechanisms driving the anomalous ACRBP expression
in a variety of cancers are unknown (9). However, ACRBP genomic gain was recently detected in ovarian serous adenocarcinoma by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) consortium
(Fig. 1A). Perhaps more clinically significant, gain of ACRBP/
OY-TES-1 expression was reported in 69% of ovarian tumors
(12). This relationship is iterated in ovarian tumor–derived

indicated and probed for coprecipitated NuMA. Normal mouse IgG was used as a negative control. Identical lysates were split for ACRBP and control IgG
immunoprecipitations. Immunoprecipitations were performed in the presence and absence of 100 nmol/L paclitaxel indicated as +/− Pac. B, whole-cell
extracts from PEO4 cells transfected with the indicated siRNAs were immunoblotted to detect the accumulation of native NuMA. C, H1155 cells were
transfected with indicated siRNAs. At 48 h posttransfection, cells were exposed to the indicated paclitaxel concentrations for 24 h. Microtubules, genomic
DNA, and centrosomes were visualized by β-tubulin, DAPI, and pericentrin immunostaining, respectively. Mitotic figures were scored microscopically
and are expressed as the percentage of total cells counted. MAD2 and BubR1-positive kinetochores in mitotic figures were used as an indication of failure
to satisfy the spindle assembly checkpoint (representative panels are shown below the arrow). A minimum of 100 cells over at least five fields of view
was scored for each group in each of three independent experiments. Error bars represent average error from the mean. NuMA protein depletion was
evaluated by immunoblot (top right), and ACRBP, EBI1, and MAP4 mRNA depletion were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR (bottom right).

cell lines and represents an attractive setting for the analysis of
the ACRBP function in cancer. We examined the serous adenocarcinoma cell lines PEO1 and PEO4, which were sequentially
derived from a chemotherapy-responsive tumor and a chemotherapy-resistant relapse from the same patient (19). Of note,
whereas ACRBP expression is activated in both lines relative to
normal tissue, it is highest in the chemoresistant PEO4 cells
(Fig. 1B). Ectopic expression of ACRBP in PEO1 and in the original siRNA screen host non–small cell lung carcinoma line
H1155 (8) was sufficient to confer resistance to paclitaxelinduced mitotic arrest relative to controls (Fig. 1C and D).
ACRBP physically and functionally interacts with NuMA
The gain-of-function activity of ACRBP indicates that this
molecule likely interacts with cellular components that otherwise promote paclitaxel responsiveness. To explore this, we
examined ACRBP-associated proteins by nano-HPLC mass
spectrometry analysis of endogenous ACRBP complexes. A
number of candidates were returned including the nuclear
and mitotic apparatus protein NuMA, which was validated
by immunoblotting anti-ACRBP immunoprecipitates from
PEO4 cells with an anti-NuMA antibody (Fig. 2A). In normal
cells, NuMA is an essential component of the mitotic spindle,
promoting spindle pole focusing and, when overexpressed, microtubule bundling (20–28). The NuMA locus is in the 11q13
chromosomal band, which is frequently amplified in many tumors and includes tumor-promoting genes such as cyclin D1,

EMSY, and MEN1. The overexpression of NuMA in cancers disrupts centrosome integrity and increases genomic instability
(21). The manifestation of spindle defects upon either loss or
gain of NuMA strongly suggests that a balance of effective
NuMA concentrations must be maintained for robust mitotic
progression (20–22). Upon depletion of ACRBP, we found that
NuMA protein levels were significantly elevated, suggesting
that ACRBP expression restrains NuMA protein accumulation
(Fig. 2B). Remarkably, codepletion of ACRBP and NuMA rescued the enhanced sensitivity to paclitaxel observed upon
ACRBP depletion alone (Fig. 2C). This effect was not observed
upon codepletion of other modulators of microtubule dynamics, including the microtubule stabilizing protein mitogenactivated protein 4 (MAP4) and the microtubule tip-binding
protein EB1 (Fig. 2C), indicating that ACRBP perturbation of
paclitaxel sensitivity is NuMA dependent (22, 23).
ACRBP supports high-fidelity mitosis
Given the role of NuMA in mitotic spindle assembly and
function (20, 24–27), we directly assessed the consequence
of ACRBP depletion on mitotic progression in real time at
single-cell resolution using stable expression of GFP-histone
H2B. Consistent with previous observations in H1155 cells,
depletion of ACRBP or exposure to 10 nmol/L paclitaxel
had no measurable consequence on the timing and only
slight consequences on the outcome of mitosis (Fig. 3; ref. 8).
In contrast, depletion of ACRBP together with 10 nmol/L

deviation from two independent experiments.

mitosis (Fig. 3B–D). Taken together, these observations indicate that ACRBP-expressing cancer cells require this protein
to support robust proper bipolar spindle formation.
ACRBP restrains NuMA-driven mitotic pathology to
enhance proliferative capacity
The overexpression of NuMA can promote multipolar
spindle formation characterized by the presence of multiple
γ-tubulin–positive spindle poles in mitotic cells. This observation has led to the hypothesis that aberrant accumulation
of NuMA in cancers may promote genomic instability through
inhibition of centrosomal coalescence (21, 28, 29). Close
examination of mitotic spindle components in lung and ovarian cancer cell lines revealed that ACRBP depletion increased
the frequency of spindle pole fragmentation upon exposure to
low-dose paclitaxel, as indicated by noncolocalized supernumerary γ-tubulin and pericentrin foci (Fig. 4A and B). This
phenotype is reminiscent of pathologic NuMA activity first described in esophageal cancer lines (21) and was reversed upon
NuMA codepletion (Fig. 4A and B). These observations suggest that ACRBP antagonizes NuMA in cancer cells to normalize defects that would otherwise lead to aberrant spindle
assembly and consequent mitotic catastrophe.
As mitotic spindle dysfunction can result in the production
of daughter cells with incomplete genomes and thus reduced
fecundity, we next examined the contribution of ACRBP to cell
cycle progression in three different ovarian cancer cell lines.
Each of these lines has a unique response to paclitaxel representing a diverse response to antimitotic agents frequently observed in culture and patient populations (Fig. 5A). As shown
in Fig. 5B, ACRBP depletion resulted in a NuMA-dependent
inhibition of BrdUrd incorporation in all lines tested. This occurred in the absence of paclitaxel challenge, indicating that
the gain of ACRBP expression confers proliferative fitness to
ovarian cancer cells.
ACRBP is a marker of clinically aggressive disease
Ovarian cancer is typically treated by surgical debulking of
the tumor mass, followed by taxane and platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimens (30). Although the majority of patients respond, nearly all will relapse within 2 to 5 years, and
the overall 5-year survival rate is <45% (30). To examine the
correlation of ACRBP expression with patient outcome, we
queried whole-genome expression array data from tumors isolated from a cohort of 29 ovarian cancer patients with associated disease histories. We found that high ACRBP expression is
significantly correlated with poor prognosis, both with respect
to overall survival (hazard ratio = 9.18, for high ACRBP group
versus low ACRBP group; P = 0.0059, from Cox regression
model) and time to disease recurrence (hazard ratio = 3.87;
P = 0.0064, from Cox regression model; Fig. 6A). Remarkably,
the most aggressive disease was associated with both high
ACRBP and high NuMA expression (Fig. 6B). This correlation is
consistent with the notion that ACRBP expression may be selected to counter the consequence of aberrantly high NuMA activity.
Given the capacity of anomalous ACRBP expression to
support robust mitotic progression in tumor-derived ovarian
cancer cell lines, we next examined the consequence of

ACRBP depletion on the mitotic progression of minimally cultured ascites-derived tumor explant cultures. Samples were
obtained at the UNC Lineberger Cancer Hospital from the ascites of three patients: two had previously undergone multiple
rounds of taxane-based chemotherapeutic regimens (LCOV2
and LCOV4) and one was chemonaïve (LCOV17; see Materials
and Methods). The derivation of epithelial tumor cells from
these samples was validated by cytokeratin 16 staining (Fig.
6C), and high-efficiency siRNA transfection protocols were derived using cytotoxic siRNAs targeting ubiquitin B (UBB; Fig.
6D). Upon ACRBP depletion, LCOV2 and LCOV4 displayed a
significant increase in mitotic figures following exposure to
doses of paclitaxel that had little to no effect on controls
(Fig. 6E). LCOV17s respond to paclitaxel by micronucleation,
as we have previously observed in ES-2 cells (Fig. 4C). This response was also sensitized upon ACRBP depletion (Fig. 6D).
Thus, inhibition of ACRBP expression increased the sensitivity
of all samples to paclitaxel-induced mitotic defects.

Discussion
Here, we have uncovered a selective dependency of ovarian
cancer cells on ACRBP for robust mitotic progression. Of note,
the ACRBP locus is predominantly expressed in the spermatocyte lineage and is not detected in normal lung or ovarian epithelia. As a consequence of expression in a sex-specific
immune-privileged site, the gene product is not recognized
as a “self” antigen and can evoke a humoral response when
displayed by cancer cells (13). The activation of ACRBP expression seems to counter what would otherwise be a NuMAdependent pathologic perturbation of microtubule dynamics
and centrosome function. The detection of native ACRBP/
NuMA complexes suggests that this antagonistic relationship
is relatively direct. Centrosome overduplication is a common
characteristic of tumors that can be normalized by a centrosome coalescence process that occurs in metaphase. Aberrant
accumulation of NuMA impairs centrosome coalescence and
can therefore promote gross chromosomal instability. This
type of spindle malfunction has been assigned as an early lesion in many tumor settings and is a source of “heritable” variation that can both drive the emergence of adaptive traits as
well as restrict population expansion through high-frequency
mitotic death (31–34). This intermediate state in tumor evolution likely selects for acquisition of traits, such as ACRBP
expression, that restore mitotic fidelity and allow clonal expansion of variants with robust proliferative and survival capacity (35, 36). We suggest that the antagonistic relationship
uncovered here is a consequence of the historical genomic instability that promotes stochastic acquisition of tumorigenic
traits during the evolution of disease (Fig. 6E). Thus, ACRBP is
a member of a class of tumor-specific vulnerabilities that
emerge as a consequence of tumor evolution, not as components that drive disrespect of proliferation or survival checkpoints but rather as components that normalize the perturbed
mitotic infrastructure responsible for disease-promoting genetic variation. Such “emergent dependencies,” if druggable,
likely represent therapeutic intervention targets with large
therapeutic windows.
