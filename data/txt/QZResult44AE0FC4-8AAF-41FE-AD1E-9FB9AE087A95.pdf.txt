ABSTRACT
High polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) expression has been linked to poor outcome
in neuroblastoma (NB), indicating that it represents a relevant therapeutic target
in this malignancy. Here, we identify a synergistic induction of apoptosis by the
PLK1 inhibitor BI 2536 and vinca alkaloids in NB cells. Synergistic drug interaction
of BI 2536 together with vincristine (VCR), vinblastine (VBL) or vinorelbine (VNR)
is confirmed by calculation of combination index (CI). Also, BI 2536 and VCR act in
concert to reduce long-term clonogenic survival. Importantly, BI 2536 significantly
enhances the antitumor activity of VCR in an in vivo model of NB. Mechanistically,
BI 2536/VCR co-treatment triggers prolonged mitotic arrest, which is necessary for
BI 2536/VCR-mediated apoptosis, since pharmacological inhibition of mitotic arrest
by the CDK1 inhibitor RO-3306 significantly reduces cell death. Prolonged mitotic
arrest leads to phosphorylation-mediated inactivation of BCL-2 and BCL-XL as well as
downregulation of MCL-1, since inhibition of mitotic arrest by RO-3306 also prevents
phosphorylation of BCL-2 and BCL-XL and MCL-1 downregulation. This inactivation
of antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins promotes activation of BAX and BAK, cleavage of
caspase-9 and -3 and caspase-dependent apoptosis. Engagement of the mitochondrial
pathway of apoptosis is critically required for BI 2536/VCR-induced apoptosis, since
ectopic expression of a non-degradable MCL-1 phospho-mutant, BCL-2 overexpression
or BAK knockdown significantly reduce BI 2536/VCR-mediated apoptosis. Thus, PLK1
inhibitors may open new perspectives for chemosensitization of NB.

controlled by pro- and antiapoptotic proteins [3]. For
example, antiapoptotic proteins of the BCL-2 family
such as BCL-2, BCL-XL and MCL-1 as well as the
proapoptotic members BAX and BAK play an important
role in regulating mitochondrial outer membrane
permeabilization [4].
Induction of programmed cell death by apoptosis is
linked to the control of cell cycle progression in order to
eliminate cells that exhibit abnormalities during mitosis.
Antimitotic drugs have been shown to engage mitotic cell
death, although the underlying molecular mechanisms have
remained largely elusive [5]. For example, vinca alkaloids
that destabilize microtubule formation such as VCR, VBL
and VNR are commonly used as anticancer drugs in various
cancers including pediatric malignancies [6].

INTRODUCTION
The prognosis of NB, a common solid tumor of
childhood, remains poor especially for advanced and
relapsed disease [1]. This highlights the demand for
the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Since
the efficacy of many anticancer therapies including
chemotherapy depends on intact cell death programs
in cancer cells, reactivation of programmed cell death
represents a promising avenue [2].
Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death
that is activated upon treatment with various anticancer
drugs [2]. Signaling via the intrinsic (mitochondrial)
pathway is critical for proper activation of caspases in
the course of anticancer drug treatment and is tightly

PLK1 is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a
critical role in the control of cell cycle progression and
mitosis [7]. PLK1 overexpression has been documented
in various cancers and has been implied in their malignant
phenotype [7]. In NB, elevated expression of PLK1
has recently been associated with high-risk disease and
unfavorable patient outcome [8], suggesting that PLK1
represents a relevant therapeutic target in NB.
Several small-molecule PLK1 inhibitors have been
developed as cancer therapeutics in recent years and are
under investigation in clinical trials [9–11]. PLK1 inhibition
has been reported to cause mitotic arrest and initiate apoptosis
in various human cancer cell lines [12, 13]. Initial testing
of the PLK1 inhibitor BI 6727 by the Pediatric Preclinical
Testing Program recently showed that BI 6727 as single agent
caused regressions in only a minority of childhood cancer
xenograft models including NB [14]. This underlines that
rational combination strategies are required to augment the
antitumor activity of PLK1 inhibitors. Searching for new
and more effective treatment options, we investigated the
potential of PLK1 inhibition for chemosensitization of NB.

activation of caspases known as key effector molecules of
apoptosis by Western blot analysis [15]. BI 2536 and VCR
cooperated to induce cleavage of caspase-9 into active
p37/p35 fragments and cleavage of caspase-3 into active
p17/p12 fragments (Figure 2A). To test whether caspase
activity is required for the induction of apoptosis, we used
the broad-range caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk. Addition of
zVAD.fmk significantly reduced BI 2536/VCR-induced
apoptosis (Figure 2B), demonstrating that caspases are
required for the induction of apoptosis upon combined
treatment with BI 2536 and VCR.

Mitotic arrest upon BI 2536/VCR treatment is
necessary for apoptosis
Next, we monitored in parallel the kinetics of
apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest, since PLK1
inhibition as well as vinca alkaloids are known to interfere
with cell cycle progression. These experiments revealed
that BI 2536 and VCR cooperated to cause a significant
G2/M phase arrest as indicated by tetraploid DNA content
(4n) already at 12 hours prior to the induction of DNA
fragmentation, used as a typical marker of apoptosis
(Figure 3A–3B, Supplementary Figure 2). Since flow
cytometry-based analysis of cell cycle distribution cannot
discriminate between M and G2 phase, we additionally
assessed phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10
(pH3) as a specific marker of mitosis [16]. BI 2536/VCR
co-treatment increased phosphorylation of histone H3
compared to treatment with either drug alone (Figure 3C),
underscoring that BI 2536/VCR co-treatment arrests cells
in mitosis.
To explore whether mitotic arrest is necessary for
apoptosis induction we used the CDK1 inhibitor RO3306 to prevent cells from entering mitosis. RO-3306
inhibited mitotic entry, as documented by lack of histone
H3 phosphorylation upon addition of RO-3306 to BI
2536/VCR-treated cells (Figure 3D), and significantly
reduced BI 2536/VCR-induced apoptosis (Figure 3E).
The observed cytotoxicity of RO-3306 alone is consistent
with a recent report showing that inhibition of CDK1 can
induce cell death in NB cells [17]. These experiments
demonstrate that mitotic arrest is required for BI 2536/
VCR-induced apoptosis.

RESULTS
PLK1 inhibitor synergizes with vinca alkaloids
to induce apoptosis in NB cells
To explore whether PLK1 inhibitors can be exploited to
enhance chemosensitivity of NB, we tested the small-molecule
PLK1 inhibitor BI 2536 together with subtoxic doses of VCR
that is frequently used in standard therapy regimens for the
treatment of NB [1]. We found that BI 2536 synergized with
VCR to induce apoptosis in NB cells (Figure 1A). Similarly,
BI 2536 acted together with other vinca alkaloids such as
VBL and VNR to significantly increase DNA fragmentation,
used as a characteristic parameter of apoptotic cell death
(Supplementary Figure 1). Synergistic drug interaction of
BI 2536 together with VCR, VBL or VNR was confirmed
by calculation of CI (Supplementary Table 1). Furthermore,
we confirmed that BI 2536 and VCR acted in concert to
significantly reduce cell viability compared to either agent
alone by using crystal violet assay as an additional cytotoxicity
test (Figure 1B). Besides these short-term assays, we tested
the effects of the drug combination on long-term clonogenic
survival by performing colony assays. BI 2536/VCR
co-treatment cooperated to significantly reduce colony
formation compared to treatment with BI 2536 or VCR
alone (Figure 1C). This set of experiments shows that the
PLK1 inhibitor BI 2536 synergistically cooperates with
vinca alkaloids to induce apoptosis and to reduce long-term
clonogenic growth of NB cells.

BI 2536 and VCR cooperate to inactivate
antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins
Since prolonged mitotic arrest has been described
to cause changes in antiapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins
[18, 19], we next monitored expression levels of BCL-2,
BCL-XL and MCL-1 by Western blot analysis. Indeed, BI
2536/VCR co-treatment altered the migration of BCL-2 and
BCL-XL on SDS-PAGE gel accompanied by upward band
shifts that are consistent with increased phosphorylation
(Figure 4A). In addition, BI 2536/VCR co-treatment caused
decreased protein expression of MCL-1 (Figure 4A). To

explore whether these changes in antiapoptotic BCL-2
proteins are linked to mitotic arrest, we added RO-3306 to
the experiments in order to prevent mitotic arrest. Preventing
cells from entering mitosis by addition of RO-3306 also
abolished the BI 2536/VCR-stimulated phosphorylation
of BCL-2 and BCL-XL as well as MCL-1 downregulation
(Figure 4B). This underscores the hypothesis that mitotic
arrest is required for BI 2536/VCR-mediated inactivation
of antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins.

degradation [19], we asked whether phosphorylationmediated degradation of MCL-1 is required for
apoptosis induction. To address this question, we used
a non-degradable phospho-defective mutant of MCL-1
(i.e. MCL-1 ‘4A’) that is mutated in four critical residues
and thus resistant to phosphorylation and subsequent
proteasomal degradation during mitosis [19]. Ectopic
expression of MCL-1 ‘4A’ mutant significantly reduced
BI 2536/VCR-mediated apoptosis (Figure 5A–5B). To
confirm that downregulation of MCL-1 protein upon BI
2536/VCR co-treatment is due to proteasomal degradation
rather than proteolytic cleavage, we tested the effects of the
proteasomal inhibitor Bortezomib and the caspase inhibitor
zVAD.fmk on BI 2536/VCR-stimulated decrease of
MCL-1 protein. Bortezomib but not zVAD.fmk prevented

in activation of the proapoptotic proteins BAX and BAK. To
address this question, we performed immunoprecipitation
using active conformation-specific antibodies to determine
the activation status of BAX and BAK by conformational
changes. BI 2536 and VCR cooperated to trigger activation
BAX and BAK (Figure 7A). To test the functional relevance
of this finding, we knocked down BAK by RNA interference
(RNAi) (Figure 7B). Silencing of BAK using two distinct
siRNA oligonucleotides significantly rescued BI 2536/
VCR-induced apoptosis (Figure 7C). These experiments
show that BI 2536 and VCR cooperate to trigger BAX/BAK
activation, which is required for BI 2536/VCR-induced
apoptosis.

BCL-2 overexpression protects against BI 2536/
VCR-induced apoptosis
Since BCL-2 has been described to become
inactivated upon phosphorylation during prolonged
mitotic arrest, we overexpressed BCL-2 (Figure 6A)
to test the functional relevance of BCL-2 for BI 2536/
VCR-induced apoptosis. Ectopic expression of BCL-2
inhibited BI 2536/VCR-triggered activation of caspase-9
and -3 (Figure 6B) and significantly reduced BI 2536/
VCR-mediated apoptosis (Figure 6C). This indicates
that phosphorylation-imposed inactivation of BCL-2
during mitotic arrest contributes to BI 2536/VCR-induced
apoptosis.

BI 2536/VCR co-treatment suppresses NB tumor
growth in vivo
Finally, we investigated the antitumor activity of
BI 2536/VCR co-treatment against NB in vivo using the
chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model, an in vivo tumor
model for anticancer drug testing [20, 21]. NB cells were
seeded on the CAM of chicken embryos, allowed to form
tumors and treated with BI 2536 and/or VCR for three
days. BI 2536/VCR co-treatment significantly reduced
tumor growth compared to single treatment (Figure 8). This
demonstrates that BI 2536/VCR co-treatment cooperates to
suppress tumor growth in a NB model in vivo.

DISCUSSION

mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis is necessary for BI
2536/VCR-induced apoptosis. Prolonged mitotic arrest
has previously been reported to disable antiapoptotic
BCL-2 proteins via phosphorylation, leading to their
inactivation (i.e. BCL-2 and BCL-XL) or proteasomal
degradation (i.e. MCL-1) [18, 19, 22, 23]. In line with this
notion, phospho-defective mutants of BCL-2, BCL-XL
or MCL-1 have been demonstrated to inhibit cell death
during mitosis [18, 19, 22–25].
Our study has several important implications.
Foremost, it emphasizes that combination regimens with
small-molecule PLK1 inhibitors and vinca alkaloids
warrant further evaluation in NB. The PLK1 inhibitor
BI 6727 as monotherapy has recently been shown in an
evaluation by the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program
to exhibit intermediate or high activity in NB xenografts
[14]. Also, Ackermann et al. reported significant
suppression of tumor formation and of established tumor
growth by treatment with BI 2536 in NB xenograft
models [8]. However, Gorlick et al. also raised some
concerns that exposure to BI 6727 in rodents that lead
to regressions may be greater than can be achieved in
humans [14]. In addition, toxicity limited the evaluation
of BI 6727 in the acute lymphoblastic leukemia in vivo

Searching for rational combination treatments, we
investigated the potential of the PLK1 inhibitor BI 2536 to
sensitize NB cells for chemotherapy. In the present study,
we discover that BI 2536 synergizes with vinca alkaloids
to trigger apoptosis in NB cells. Moreover, BI 2536 acts
together with VCR to suppress long-term clonogenic survival
and to inhibit tumor growth in an in vivo model of NB.
Mechanistic studies reveal that BI 2536 and
VCR act in concert to cause mitotic arrest that results
in phosphorylation-mediated inactivation of BCL-2
and BCL-XL as well as downregulation of MCL-1.
Inactivation of antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins in turn
promotes BAX and BAK activation, leading to cleavage
of caspase-9 and -3 and caspase-dependent apoptosis.
Several lines of genetic evidence support our conclusion
that differential modulation of BCL-2 family proteins
in favor of proapoptotic proteins during mitotic arrest is
required for BI 2536/VCR-induced apoptosis, since i)
ectopic expression of a MCL-1 phospho-mutant, ii) BCL-2
overexpression or iii) BAK knockdown significantly
decrease BI 2536/VCR-mediated apoptosis. Together,
these data demonstrate that the engagement of the

panel [14]. Drug combinations can offer advantages, as
relatively low concentrations of each drug may achieve
synergistic antitumor activity without causing additive
toxicity. This underscores the relevance of our key finding
showing synergism of PLK1 inhibitor-based combination
therapies together with vinca alkaloids in preclinical
in vitro and in vivo models of NB. We recently reported
that systemic administration of BI 6727 and VCR
cooperated to significantly suppress tumor growth in vivo
without causing additive toxicity using a human xenograft
mouse model of rhabdomyosarcoma [26], pointing to
some tumor selectivity of this combination treatment.
The feasibility of transferring this approach into
future experimental treatment protocols is underscored
by the fact that vinca alkaloids such as VCR are part
of standard therapy for NB and that the PLK1 inhibitor
BI 6727 as single agent is under evaluation in a phase I
clinical trial in pediatric malignancies (http://www.
clinicaltrials.gov). Moreover, previous studies highlighted
the significance of PLK1 as a therapeutic target in NB.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

High expression levels of PLK1 have been detected in
high-risk NB and were associated with several unfavorable
prognostic parameters [8]. Using a small-molecule kinase
inhibitor screen, PLK1 was identified as a critical regulator
of survival and self-renewal in NB tumor-initiating cells
that have been implicated in sustaining tumor growth,
progression and metastasis [27]. Taken together, PLK1
inhibitors represent promising compounds to sensitize NB
for chemotherapy that warrant further investigation.

Figure 8: BI 2536 and VCR cooperate to suppress tumor growth in vivo. SH-EP cells were implanted on the CAM of fertilized
chicken eggs at day 8 of incubation and treated with 7.5 nM BI 2536 and/or 5 nM VCR for three consecutive days. Tumors were dissected
with surrounding CAM and tumor area was analyzed in hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained sections. Data are shown as mean + SD
(A. n = 15–19 eggs) or as representative images of HE-stained sections (B. scale bar: 1 mm). **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001.

and analyzed by Western blotting using rabbit anti-BAK
antibody or rabbit anti-BAX NT antibody.

(Life Technologies, Inc.), caspase-3, caspase-9 (Cell
Signaling, Beverly, MA), BAX NT, pH3 (Millipore,
Darmstadt, Germany), MCL-1 (Enzo Life Science,
Lörrach, Germany), GAPDH (HyTest, Turku, Finland).
Goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated
to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as
secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence
(Amersham Bioscience, Freiburg, Germany) or
infrared dye-labeled secondary antibodies and infrared
imaging were used for detection (Odyssey Imaging
System, LI-COR Bioscience, Bad Homburg, Germany).
Representative blots of at least two independent
experiments are shown.

Cell cycle analysis
Cells were stained with PI as described previously
[28]. Cell cycle analysis was performed using FlowJo
Software (Tree Star Inc, Oregon, USA) following
manufacturer’s instructions.

CAM assay
CAM assay was done as described previously [29].
Briefly, 1 × 106 SH-EP cells were implanted on fertilized
chicken eggs on day 8 of incubation and were treated with
34.31 ng BI 2536 and/or 40.48 ng VCR (corresponding to 7.5
nM BI 2536 and 5 nM VCR in cell culture experiments) for
three consecutive days, sampled with the surrounding CAM,
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, cut in
3 μm sections and then analyzed by immunohistochemistry
using 1:1 hematoxylin and 0.5% eosin. Images were digitally
recorded and tumor areas were analyzed with ImageJ digital
imaging software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).

Statistical analysis
Statistical significance was assessed by Student’s
t-Test (two-tailed distribution, two-sample, equal variance).
Drug interactions were analyzed by the CI method based
on that described by Chou [30] using CalcuSyn software
(Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). CI < 0.9 indicates synergism,
0.9–1.1 additivity and > 1.1 antagonism.
