ABSTRACT
Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most prevalent childhood malignancy.
Although most children with ALL are cured, there is still a group of patients for which
therapy fails owing to severe toxicities and drug resistance. Ginsenoside Rh2 (GRh2),
a major bioactive component isolated from Panax ginseng, has been shown to have
a therapeutic effect on some tumors. However, the molecular mechanisms of cell
death induced by 20(S)-GRh2 in ALL cells remains unclear. In this study, we showed
that 20(S)-GRh2 inhibited the cell growth and induced mitochondria-dependent
apoptosis and autophagy. But it has no cytotoxic effect on human normal blood cells.
Furthermore, autophagy plays a protective role in 20(S)-GRh2-induced apoptosis in
ALL cell lines and human primary ALL cells. We demonstrated that either genetic or
pharmacologic inhibition of autophagy could be more effective in reducing viability
and enhancing 20(S)-GRh2-induced toxicity than 20(S)-GRh2 treatment alone. In
addition, inhibition of autophagy could aggravate mitochondrial ROS generation
and mitochondrial damage, and then accelerate mitochondria-dependent apoptosis.
Taken together, these results suggest that inhibition of autophagy can sensitize ALL
cells towards 20(S)-GRh2. The appropriate inhibition of autophagy could provide a
powerful strategy to increase the potency of 20(S)-GRh2 as a novel anticancer agent
for ALL therapy.

lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) associated with a poor
outcome [3, 4]. However, current standard treatment consists
of combination chemotherapy that is highly toxic to growing
children, both in short and long terms [5–7]. To avoid serious
side effects in chemotherapy and improve survival rates,
novel anticancer agents are needed to address the emerging
problem. Recent studies have shown that several natural
traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) products can activate
cell death pathway in cancer cells [8, 9].

INTRODUCTION
Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most
common malignancy in childhood, accounting for 25% of all
childhood cancers [1]. It can be regarded as clonal expansion
of B- and T-lymphocytes arrested at an immature stage of
differentiation a malignant disorder of lymphoid progenitor
cells [2]. Precursor B-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (pre
B-ALL) is the most prevalent phenotype of ALL, and T-acute

Ginsenosides are extracted from the root of Panax
ginseng C.A. Meyer, which are the major effective
ingredients in ginseng [10, 11]. Based on the structural
differences, ginsenosides can be classified 20(S)protopanaxadiol (ginsenosides Rb1, Rb2, Rb3, Rc, Rd, Rh2,
Rg3 and others) or 20(S)-protopanaxatriol (ginsenosides
Re, Rg1, Rg2, Rh1 and others) compounds [12, 13]. Among
these, GRh2 has been shown to have anticancer effects, and
could inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in several
cancer cell lines [13–16]. Furthermore, it has been reported
that 20(S)-GRh2 exhibits stronger anticancer activity than
20(R)-GRh2 [17–18]. Due to its safety and no side-effects,
GRh2 could be further developed as a useful drug for
cancer therapy [19, 20]. Recently, researchers have found
that 20(S)-GRh2 could induce autophagy when undergoing
induced apoptosis in Hepatocellular carcinoma [21]. Our
previous studies demonstrated that 20(S)-GRh2 could
inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in pre B-ALL Reh
cells [22]. In this report, we are interested to investigate
whether autophagy was intervened in 20(S)-GRh2-induced
apoptosis in human ALL cells.
Autophagy and apoptosis are catabolic pathways
essential for organismal homeostasis, both of which play
key roles in ultimate decisions of cancer cell fate [23].
Apoptosis, or type I PCD, involves the degradation of
cellular constituents by a family of cysteine proteases called
caspases [24]. As we all known, two core pathways exist to
induce apoptosis, the extrinsic-death receptor pathway and
intrinsic-mitochondrial pathway [25]. The mitochondrial
pathway of apoptosis is seen as a common cause of tumor
cell death induced by chemotherapeutic agents [26, 27].
The mitochondrial apoptotic pathway is characterized
by reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, loss of
mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), release of
cytochrome c into the cytoplasm, which is followed by
activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 [28–30].
Similarly, autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved
catabolic process of lysosomal degradation of cytoplasmic
content in eukaryotes [31]. It is regulated by proteins
including mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR),
phosphoinosmde-3-kinase (PI3K), GTPases, calcium
and elements of protein synthesis machinery [32]. Recent
studies have demonstrated that the existence of a complex
relationship between autophagy and apoptosis, determining
whether a cell will live or die in response to anticancer
therapies [33, 34]. On one hand, autophagy can clear toxic
elements and damage organelles, which suppresses apoptosis
and prevents cell death [35]. On the other hand, it could also
act as a facilitator of apoptosis via damaging mitochondria
and contribute to cell death [36]. However, the molecular
mechanisms of the interaction between autophagy and
apoptosis induced by 20(S)-GRh2 remain unclear.
In the present study, we used autophagy inhibitor
3-methyladenine (3-MA), autophagy stimulator rapamycin
(RAPA) and ATG5 knockdown to evaluate the potential
role of autophagy in 20(S)-GRh2-induced apoptosis. We
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

examined mitochondrial function and ROS generation to
elucidate the interaction between autophagy and apoptosis
induced by 20(S)-GRh2 in ALL. These findings would
illuminate the anticancer property of 20(S)-GRh2 and
provide a promising strategy for treatment of ALL.

RESULTS
Effect of 20(S)-GRh2 on cell proliferation in ALL
cell lines and human normal blood cells
The effect of 20(S)-GRh2 on cell viability in ALL cell
lines and human normal blood cells were investigated by
cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Cells were treated with
increasing concentrations of 20(S)-GRh2 for 24 h. The results
showed that 20(S)-GRh2 significantly reduced the viability of
ALL cell lines in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1A & 1B).
The IC50 of 20(S)-GRh2 was about 40 μM for Reh cells and
35 μM for Jurkat cells. However, the viability of normal Band T- cells were not obviously decreased (Figure 1D & 1E).
Then we chose 40 μM GRh2 to detect the cell
growth at different time points. When cells were treated
with 40 μM 20(S)-GRh2 for 48 h, the viability of Reh and
Jurkat cells were decreased in a time-dependent manner
(Figure 1C), whereas in normal B- and T- cells, the cell
viability were not significantly decreased. (Figure  1F).
Collectively, these results suggest that 20(S)-GRh2
inhibits cell proliferation of ALL cell lines and has no
cytotoxic effect on human normal blood cells.

20(S)-GRh2 induces mitochondria-dependent
apoptosis in ALL cells
First, we examined apoptotic cells induced by 20(S)GRh2 via Annexin V and 7-AAD double staining. Cells
were treated with 40 μM 20(S)-GRh2 for 48 h, and Annexin
V positive cells were measured with flow cytometric
analysis. The results showed that in Reh and Jurkat cells,
the population of Annexin V positive cells was 16.66 ±
3.25 % and 20.70 ± 3.22 % at 24 h, respectively. After a
48 h treatment with 40 μM 20(S)-GRh2, the percentage of
apoptotic cells was further increased to 50.87 ± 5.43 % at
24 h and 47.72 ± 5.02 %, respectively. However, in normal
B- and T- cells, the apoptotic levels were not significantly
increased after 24 h and 48 h 20(S)-GRh2 administration
(Figure 2A & 2B). These data indicate that 20(S)-GRh2 can
induce cell death in ALL cells but not in normal blood cells.
Then, in order to measure mitochondrial ROS
levels triggered by 20(S)-GRh2 in ALL cells, we used
MitoSOX™ Red reagent, which can detect superoxide
inside mitochondria of live cells. The results showed that the
red fluorescence intensity was obviously increased in 20(S)GRh2-treated Reh and Jurkat cells, and then markedly
attenuated when concurrent treatment with mitoTEMPO,
a specific mitochondrial ROS inhibitor (Figure 2C). In
addition, the levels of mitochondrial ROS were not obviously

increased, when normal B- and T- cells were treated with
40 μM 20(S)-GRh2 for 24 h (Supplementary Figure S2A
& S2B). On one hand, mitochondrial damage could lead
to mitochondrial dysfunction. We used the sensitive
fluorescent probe JC-1 as an indicator of mitochondrial
dysfunction to examine the MMP levels. In fluorescence
microscopic study, 20(S)-GRh2 induced a shift in the
fluorescence spectrum of JC-1 from an aggregated form
with orange-red fluorescence to a monomeric form with
green fluorescence (Figure 2D & 2E), while mitoTEMPO
rescued the reduction of red/green ratio in 20(S)-GRh2treated Reh and Jurkat cells (Figure 2F). On the other hand,
mitochondrial damage could trigger intrinsic apoptosis. We
analyzed the expression of mitochondrial apoptosis-related
proteins in 20(S)-GRh2-treated cells by western blot. We
found that the expression levels of cytochrome c, cleaved
caspase-9 and -3 proteins were upregulated; whereas the
expression levels of these proteins were decreased by
adding mitoTEMPO in 20(S)-GRh2-treated Reh cells
(Supplementary Figure S1A & S1B). Therefore, these
results suggest that 20(S)-GRh2 induces apoptosis through
generation of mitochondrial ROS and mitochondrial
signaling pathways in ALL cells.

were treated with increasing concentrations of 20(S)GRh2 and stained with MDC, a fluorescent dye that
selectively labels autophagic vacuoles (AVOs). As shown
in Supplementary Figure S3A, in laser scanning confocal
microscope study, MDC staining revealed that huge
amount of AVOs formation occurred in Reh cells after 24
h 20(S)-GRh2 treatment. Consistent with this finding, in
flow cytometric study, the percentage of MDC positive
cells was also increased after 20(S)-GRh2 treatment
(Supplementary Figure S3B & S3C).
To determine whether 20(S)-GRh2 treatment
increased the autophagic flux in Reh and Jurkat cells,
we conducted an analysis using autophagy protein LC3II by western blot. As shown in Reh and Jurkat cells, the
expression levels of LC3-II were increased at 24 h after
treatment with increasing concentrations of 20(S)-GRh2
(Figure 3A & 3B). These data indicate that 20(S)-GRh2
treatment induces autophagic flux in ALL cells. Next,
ultrastructural analysis by electron microscopy also revealed
the formation of autophagosome in Reh and Jurkat cells at
24 h after 20(S)-GRh2 treatment (Figure 3C).
For further confirmation of autophagy, we
performed an LC3 puncta assay by using pEGFP-LC3 and
chloroquine (CQ), which inhibits late phase autophagy.
The results showed that in Reh and Jurkat cells, 20(S)GRh2 treatment significantly increased the number of
GFP-LC3 puncta per cell compared with control, and
CQ further enhanced the GFP-LC3 positive puncta upon
20(S)-GRh2 treatment (Figure 3D & 3E). Taken together,

20(S)-GRh2 induces autophagy in ALL cells
Firstly, we used monodansylcadaverine (MDC), a
lysosomotropic compound to assess autophagy induction
via the accumulation of MDC-labeled vacuoles. Reh cells

Inhibition of autophagy accelerates 20(S)-GRh2induced apoptosis via mitochondrial ROS and
mitochondrial damage

these results suggest that 20(S)-GRh2 can also induce
autophagy in ALL cells.

Autophagy is involved in 20(S)-GRh2-induced
toxicity in ALL cells

To investigate the mechanisms of 20(S)-GRh2induced toxicity to ALL cells, we measured mitochondrial
ROS levels, MMP and mitochondrial-related apoptosis
proteins. We found that in Reh cells, mitochondrial ROS
generation was markedly increased in cells treated with
3-MA and 20(S)-GRh2, but significantly decreased in cells
treated with RAPA and 20(S)-GRh2, compared to 20(S)GRh2 alone (Figure 5A & 5B). Furthermore, combined
treatment of 3-MA and 20(S)-GRh2 markedly accelerated
depolarization of MMP, but combination of RAPA and
20(S)-GRh2 significantly attenuated it, compared with
20(S)-GRh2 treatment alone (Figure 5C & 5D). In addition,
combined treatment of 3-MA and 20(S)-GRh2 dramatically
increased the expression levels of mitochondria-associated
pro-apoptotic proteins compared with 20(S)-GRh2
treatment alone, while combination of RAPA and 20(S)GRh2 markedly decreased the expression levels of these
proteins in Reh cells (Supplementary Figure S6A & S6B).
Next, we used shRNA to knockdown autophagy
gene products ATG5 to confirm the role of mitochondrial
ROS in 20(S)-GRh2-induced toxicity. The results showed
that in Reh cells, shATG5 combined with 20(S)-GRh2
treatment markedly increased the fluorescence intensity
compared with cells treated with 20(S)-GRh2 and control
vector (Supplementary Figure S7A & S7B). In addition,
combined treatment of autophagy inhibition with shATG5
and 20(S)-GRh2 significantly accelerated the loss of MMP
compared with 20(S)-GRh2 and control vector treatment
(Supplementary Figure S7C & S7D). These results taken
together indicate that either genetic or pharmacologic
inhibition of autophagy combined with 20(S)-GRh2
aggravates accumulation of mitochondrial ROS and
mitochondrial damage, thus promoting apoptosis.

We used 3-MA and RAPA to investigate the role
of autophagy in 20(S)-GRh2-induced toxicity. 3-MA,
an autophagic inhibitor, interferes with the formation of
autophagosomes in mammalian cells via inhibition of the
class III PI3K activity [37]. RAPA, an autophagic inducer,
could inhibit mTOR, thus enhancing autophagy [38]. The
involvement of autophagy was confirmed using LC3 puncta
assay. As shown in Reh and Jurkat cells, the number of GFPLC3 puncta per cell was significantly increased in cells treated
with 3-MA and 20(S)-GRh2, while markedly decreased in
cells treated with RAPA and 20(S)-GRh2, compared to 20(S)GRh2 alone (Supplementary Figure S4A & S4B). In addition,
the number of GFP-LC3 puncta per cell was not significantly
increased after 24 h 20(S)-GRh2 administration, while
markedly increased in normal B- and T-cells treated with RAPA
compared with control (Supplementary Figure S2C & S2D).
Then, combination of 3-MA and 20(S)-GRh2 was most
effective in reducing cell viability compared with 20(S)-GRh2
alone, while induction of autophagy by RAPA significantly
improved cell viability in the presence of 20(S)-GRh2
(Figure 4A). Moreover, combination of 3-MA and 20(S)GRh2 effectively increased the percentage of apoptotic cells
compared with 20(S)-GRh2 treatment alone, while induction
of autophagy by RAPA dramatically attenuated apoptotic cell
death (Figure 4C & 4D). These results indicate that inhibition
of autophagy by 3-MA accelerates 20(S)-GRh2-induced
toxicity to ALL cells, while induction of autophagy by RAPA
protects ALL cells against 20(S)-GRh2-induced toxicity.
Next, to verify involvement of autophagy in 20(S)GRh2-induced cytotoxicity, we specifically inhibited
autophagy with shRNA targeting essential autophagyrelated protein ATG5 in combination with 20(S)-GRh2.
The results showed that shATG5 combined with 20(S)GRh2 treatment markedly reduced the viability of Reh and
Jurkat cells compared with cells treated with 20(S)-GRh2
and vector (Figure 4B). Furthermore, we used the LIVE/
DEAD® viability/cytotoxicity assay to quantitate cell death.
The results showed that combined treatment of autophagy
inhibition with shATG5 and 20(S)-GRh2 significantly
increased the percentage of dead cells compared with 20(S)GRh2 and vector treatment (Figure 4E and Supplementary
Figure S5A). These results suggest that in Reh and Jurkat
cells, ATG5 knockdown can more effectively decrease cell
viability and accelerate apoptotic cell death upon 20(S)GRh2 treatment. Taken together, autophagy acts as an
adaptive way to protect ALL cells against 20(S)-GRh2induced cytotoxicity. Either genetic or pharmacologic
inhibition of autophagy combined with 20(S)-GRh2 can
be more effective in exacerbating 20(S)-GRh2-induced
cytotoxicity than treatment with 20(S)-GRh2 alone.

Effect of autophagy on 20(S)-GRh2-induced
apoptosis in primary ALL cells
We also evaluated the effect of autophagy on 20(S)GRh2-induced apoptosis in primary ALL cells. Firstly, we
investigated whether treatment with 20(S)-GRh2 could
induce autophagy in primary ALL cells. As shown in
Figure 6A & 6B, both primary B- ALL and T- ALL cells
treated with 20(S)-GRh2 showed increased number of
GFP-LC3 puncta per cell compared with untreated cells.
CQ further enhanced GFP-positive puncta upon 20(S)GRh2 treatment, indicating that 20(S)-GRh2 treatment
induced autophagic flux. Next, we used CQ to determine
the effect of autophagy on 20(S)-GRh2-induced apoptosis
in primary ALL cells. Our data showed that 20(S)-GRh2
treatments alone significantly increased the percentage
of apoptotic cells compared with control, while the
combination of CQ and 20(S)-GRh2 further increased the

together indicate that inhibition of autophagy by CQ
exacerbates 20(S)-GRh2-induced apoptosis in primary
ALL cells.

innovative approaches are needed to further improve
survival rates and to avoid serious side effects.
Ginsenosides, the major pharmacologically active
ingredients of ginseng, have been shown to have multiple
medical effects such as anti-oxidative, anti-inflammation,
anticancer and other health-improving activities [40, 41].
GRh2 is a pure compound extracted from ginsenosides
and has anticancer activity [13-16, 42]. In this study, our
objective is to explore the relationship between apoptosis
and autophagy in 20(S)-GRh2-treated ALL cells, which
could provide a novel anticancer agent for ALL therapies.

DISCUSSION
ALL is the most common childhood tumor,
accounting for almost 30% of pediatric cancers [39]. As
a step in overcoming the limitation in chemotherapy,

Recently, it has been reported widely that GRh2
could inhibit tumor cells proliferation and induce tumor
cells apoptosis [43–45]. The results presented here
suggested that in human ALL cells, 20(S)-GRh2 inhibited
cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner, while
had no cytotoxic ability to human normal blood cells.
Both apoptosis and autophagy play essential roles in
the development of organs, homeostasis, and cancer. A
comprehensive understanding of autophagy and apoptosis
is essential for the development of effective cancer
therapeutics [46, 47]. Consistent with previous studies, our
data were confirmed that 20(S)-GRh2 induced apoptosis
through mitochondrial signaling pathway in ALL cells.
Meanwhile, we reported a novel function of 20(S)-GRh2,
induction of autophagy, as shown by cell morphological

changes and increased autophagic flux in ALL cells. But
20(S)-GRh2 can not induce autophagy in normal blood
cells. Therefore, we demonstrated that autophagy and
apoptosis were both induced by 20(S)-GRh2 in ALL cells.
The intricate relationship between autophagy
and apoptosis is complex and varies with cell and stress
distinction [48, 49]. Some recent studies have focused on
the intricate relationship between drug-induced autophagy
and apoptosis. Several contradictory views of the effects of
autophagy on chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in cancer
have been reported [50, 51]. Chemotherapy-induced
autophagy protects cells from apoptosis in some contexts
[52], but promotes apoptosis in the others [53]. To explore
the interplay between apoptosis and autophagy in 20(S)GRh2-treated ALL cells, we used 3-MA, RAPA and ATG5

knockdown to manipulate autophagy. We demonstrated that
inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA sensitizes ALL cells to
20(S)-GRh2, while induction of autophagy by RAPA protects
cells against apoptosis. In addition, we found that ATG5
knockdown further enhanced cytotoxicity of 20(S)-GRh2 to
ALL cells. Therefore, these findings suggest that autophagy
plays a protective role in 20(S)-GRh2-induced apoptosis, and
either genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of autophagy can
effectively sensitize ALL cells to 20(S)-GRh2.
Then, to illuminate the molecular mechanisms
of interaction between apoptosis and autophagy in
20(S)-GRh2-treated ALL cells, we further investigated
mitochondrial ROS levels and mitochondrial dysfunction.
ROS mainly generate inside mitochondria, whereas
excess ROS generation could cause mitochondrial
damage [54, 55]. Some links between apoptosis and
autophagy are indicated via mitochondria [56]. It is
reported that the elimination of damaged mitochondria
by autophagy would prevent the release of proapoptotic

substances from mitochondria, thus preventing apoptosis.
In the absence of such clean up, the release of molecules
like cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF)
from damaged mitochondria would lead to apoptosis
[57, 58]. In this study, we found that inhibition of
autophagy combined with 20(S)-GRh2 markedly
increased mitochondrial ROS generation and accelerated
dissipation of MMP in ALL cells, while induction of
autophagy combined with 20(S)-GRh2 significantly
alleviated 20(S)-GRh2-induced mitochondrial ROS
generation and mitochondrial damage. In addition,
mitochondrial damage further caused the release of
cytochrome c and mitochondrial-related apoptosis
proteins. Taken together, these results indicate that
autophagy can help to clean up damaged mitochondria
and play a protective role against 20(S)-GRh2-induced
apoptosis. Inhibition of autophagy would aggravate
mitochondrial damage, thus promoting mitochondriadependent apoptosis in ALL cells.

Moreover, we extended our study to find out
whether autophagy played a role in 20(S)-GRh2induced apoptosis in primary ALL cells. We found that
20(S)-GRh2 treatment could increase autophagic flux
in either primary B- ALL or T- ALL cells. Inhibition of
autophagy by CQ sensitized those cancer cells towards
20(S)-GRh2. Therefore, our data suggest that inhibition
of autophagy combined with 20(S)-GRh2 treatment
would be more effective, and closer for future clinical
application.
In view of the above arguments and the new data
presented herein, we strongly propose that autophagy
plays a protective role in 20(S)-GRh2-induced apoptosis
in ALL cell lines and human primary ALL cells. Either
genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of autophagy can
be more effective in reducing viability and enhancing
20(S)-GRh2-induced toxicity to ALL cells. In addition,
inhibition of autophagy could accelerate mitochondriadependent apoptosis by stimulating mitochondrial ROS
generation, promoting the loss of MMP and upregulation
of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in ALL cells.
Collectively, this study suggests that inhibition of
autophagy could potentiate anticancer property of 20(S)GRh2 and provide a novel strategy for ALL therapy in
future.

cells (PBMC) by FACS (BD Bioscience Influx, Franklin
Lakes, NJ, USA). In brief, the PBMCs were incubated
with FITC-conjugated anti-CD3, PE-conjugated antiCD19 and purified by FACS to obtain the CD3+ T-cells
and CD19+ B- cells, respectively. The purities of the sorted
cells were >95%.
Human pre-B-ALL cell line Reh and T-ALL cell line
Jacket were purchased from Cell Bank of Chinese Academic
of Science (Shanghai, China). Cells were cultured at 37°C
and 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium (Hyclone, Logan, Utah,
USA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS,
Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA), Penicillin/Streptomycin
(1:100, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The cytotoxicity assay

Cell viability assays
Cell viability was determined by CCK-8 (Dojin
Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) assay in different cells.
Cells (5 × 105 /mL) were plated on a 96-well (100 μL /
well) microplate and treated with ligands for required
time. Cells were added with 10 μL CCK-8 solution, and
incubated for 4 h at 37°C. Absorbance in each well was
quantified at 450 nm using an automated enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reader (Tecan, Salzburg,
Austria).

Cells transfected with vector or ShATG5 plasmid
were exposed to 40 μM GRh2 for 24 h and stained
using the LIVE/DEAD® viability/cytotoxicity assay
kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) to analyze for the
presence of live or dead cells. Briefly, calcein AM probe
is conversed to the intensely fluorescent calcein in living
cells, producing a green fluorescence. While, EthD-1
probe enters cells with damaged membranes, producing
a red fluorescence by binding to nucleic acids. Cells were
then stained with nuclear Hoechst 33342. The percentage
of dead cells with EthD-1 probe was determined in highpower fields of each sample. Images were analyzed using
Image J. A minimum 500 cells were counted.

Reagents and antibodies
20(S)-GRh2 (purity 99.48%) was purchased from
Beijing North Carolina Chuanglian Biological Technology
Research Istitute (Beijing, China). MitoTEMPO was
obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX,
USA), 3-MA, CQ and RAPA were purchased from Sigma.
The primary antibodies against rabbit cytochrome
c, caspase-9, cleaved caspase-3, and the secondary
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled goat-anti-mouse
and goat-anti-rabbit antibodies, were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). Antibodies
against rabbit cleaved caspase-9, GAPDH, β-actin,
Tubulin were purchased from Bioworld Technology
(NanJing, China). Antibodies against rabbit LC-3, Atg5
and beclin-1 were obtained from Abcam Company
(Cambridge, MA, USA).

Annexin V/7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) flow
cytometry assay
Cells were treated with different ligands for
required time. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS
and resuspended in binding buffer 500 μL. Annexin
V-APC and 7-Amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD, BD
Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) were added, away
from light for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were
immediately evaluated by flow cytometry (FACScan;
Becton Dickinson, San Diego, CA, USA) within one hour.
Annexin V+ and 7-AAD− cells were designated as early
apoptotic cells and Annexin V+ and 7-AAD+ cells were
designated as late apoptotic cells.

Samples and cell culture
Bone marrow (BM) samples were derived from 6
newly diagnosed cases, untreated patients with B-ALL and
T-ALL. Peripheral blood (PB) samples were obtained from
3 healthy individuals. All human BM and PB samples were
obtained with written informed consent. Mononuclear
cells isolated from BM and PB through density gradient
centrifugation on standard Ficoll-HyPaque. T-cells and
B-cells were sorted from peripheral blood mononuclear

Detection of autophagic vacuoles by MDC
staining

Detection of mitochondrial membrane potential

A fluorescent compound, MDC (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO, USA), has served as a useful fluorescent marker for
autophagic vacuoles. Reh cells (5×105/well) were cultured
in 6-well culture plates and treated without or with 20(S)GRh2 (20 and 40 μM) for 24 h, then incubated with 50
μM MDC in PBS at 37°C for 1 h. After washing with
PBS, the stained cells were immediately observed under a
laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss, Germany) and
analyzed by flow cytometry.

Cells were cultured in 12-well plates (5×105/
well) and treated with different ligands. In ALL cells,
fluorescent probe JC-1 (Sigma, Louis, MO, USA) was
used to estimate MMP. In cells treated with vector or
shATG5, the MMP was determined using the fluorescent
MitoTracker probe (Invitrogen). After 24 h incubation,
cells were stained with JC-1 or MitoTracker in the dark
at 37°C for 30 min and immediately observed under a
fuorescence microscopy or analyzed by a FACScan flow
cytometer.

Detection of GFP-LC3

Transmission electron microscopy

Human pEGFP-LC3 plasmid (Addgene plasmid
24920), which encodes a fusion protein of enhanced green
fluorescent protein (EGFP) and LC3, was obtained from
Addgene (Cambridge, MA, USA). Cells were seeded in
12-well plates and transfected with pEGFP-LC3 plasmid
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. After 24 h transfection,
cells were treated with different ligands for 24 h. The
fluorescence of GFP-LC3 was examined by laser scanning
confocal microscope. Autophagic flux was determined by
evaluating the punctuated pattern of GFP (punctae/cell
were counted).

After treatment with 40 μM GRh2 for 24 h, Reh and
Jurkat cells, including control, were collected and fixed
with 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution (pH7.4) for 2 h, postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h, and then washed.
After dehydration in a growing gradient of ethanol (30, 50,
70 and 95%, 5 min for each step), impregnation steps and
inclusion were performed in Epon and finally polymerized
at 60°C for 48 h. Ultrathin sections were stained with
uranyl acetate and lead citrate for observation under a
Tecnai G2 Spirit Twin transmission electron microscope
(FEI, USA) at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV.

Western blot analysis

Knockdown of ATG5

After treatment, cells were collected and lysed
for 30 min in RIPA buffer. The samples were heated to
100°C for 5 min and placed briefy on ice. A total of 20
μL of the supernatant was loaded onto a 12% sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) gel. After electrophoresis, the protein was
electrotransferred to a Hybond-ECL polyvi-nylidene
fuoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with
5% milk for 1 h, and incubated overnight with primary
antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room
temperature. The membranes were incubated with
HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room
temperature. The immunoreactive bands were detected
with an enhanced chemiluminescence.

ATG5 expression was knockdown by transfected
with shRNA retroviruses. The shRNA and sequence was
5′-GCCATCAATCGGAAACTCATG-3′. Retrovirus particles
were obtained in HEK293T cells according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were seeded into sixwell plates and transfected with either empty or shRNA
retroviruses using X-tremeGENE HP reagent (Roche Applied
Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA), then stably transduced cells
were selected by puromycin antibiotics in the medium.

Measurement of mitochondrial ROS generation
The formation of mitochondrial ROS was measured
using MitoSOX™ Red (Life technologies) assay.
MitoSOX™ Red reagent is oxidized by superoxide once
inside the mitochondria, and is converted to a fluorogenic
oxidation product upon binding to nucleic acids [39]. For
microscopy, cells were treated with 40 μM GRh2 for 24 h
in the presence or absence of 50 μM mitoTEMPO. After
staining with MitoSOX™ Red, cells were stained with
Hoechst 33342. Microscopic images of fluorescence were
collected using a fuorescence microscopy (IX-81; Olympus
Corp., Tokyo, Japan). For flow cytometry, cells were treated
with different ligands for 24 h. After staining, MitoSOX™
Red fluorescence was analyzed by flow cytometry.

Statistical analyses
All data were expressed as the means± the standard
error of the mean (SEM). Statistical analyses were
performed using Prism 5.03 (GraphPad Software Inc.,
San Diego, CA, U.S.A.). The data were examined using
Student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA followed by the
Bonferroni post hoc test. A p value less than 0.05 was
considered significant. The levels of significance were set
at p < 0.05, p < 0.01 or p < 0.001.
