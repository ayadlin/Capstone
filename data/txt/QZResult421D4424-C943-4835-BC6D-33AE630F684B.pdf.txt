Abstract
Pituitary tumor transforming gene 1 (PTTG1) is expressed in
most tumors. However, whether thyroid hormone (T3) and
its receptors (TR) regulate PTTG1 in human hepatocellular
carcinomas (HCC) remains unclear. Previous cDNA microarrays revealed PTTG1 is down-regulated by T3/TR. This study
investigated the significance of PTTG1 regulation by T3 in HCC
cells. The PTTG1 mRNA and protein expression were
repressed by T3 in HCC cell lines overexpressing TR. However,
after knockdown of TRs expression by RNA interference,
PTTG1 repression by T3 was abolished. Similar results were
observed in thyroidectomized rats. To localize the regulatory
region in the PTTG1 promoter, serial deletions within the
PTTG1 promoter region were constructed. The promoter
activity of the PTTG1 gene was repressed (25–51%) by T3.
Additionally, these findings indicate that PTTG1 may be
regulated by Sp1. The critical role of the 594 and 520 Sp1
binding sites was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift
assay. Transfection with Sp1 expression vector enhanced the
activity of the PTTG1 promoter fragment reporter. Also, Sp1
was down-regulated in HCC cells and in thyroidectomized rat
after T3 treatment. Additionally, ectopic expression of PTTG1
promotes cell proliferation in Hep3B hepatoma cells. Conversely, knockdown of PTTG1 or Sp1 expression reduced cell
proliferation in HepG2 cells. Notably, the expression of PTTG1
and Sp1 was inversely correlated with the expression of TR
proteins in HCC. Together, these findings indicate that PTTG1
gene expression is mediated by Sp1 and is indirectly downregulated by T3. Finally, overexpression of PTTG1 or SP1 in
HCCs is TR-dependent and crucial in the development of HCC.

Introduction
Thyroid hormone (T3) regulates growth, development, and
differentiation in vertebrates. Triiodothyronine binds to specific
receptors (thyroid hormone receptors, TR), which belong to the
superfamily of nuclear receptors. These receptors function as
ligand-dependent transcription factors by binding to sequences
known as thyroid hormone response elements (TRE), which are
usually located in the promoter regions of target genes (1). The
human TRs are encoded by the TRa and TRh genes located on
human chromosomes 17 and 3, respectively. By alternative splicing
and different promoter usage, these two genes yield at least four
proteins: TRa1, TRa2, TRh1, and TRh2 (2).

The liver is well recognized as a target organ for T3. Human
hepatocytes express equal amounts of TRa1 and TRh1 proteins (3).
Normal human hepatocytes are difficult to maintain in vitro and
become senescent soon after isolation. Therefore, T3 regulation
was examined in several human hepatoma cell lines. Using a cDNA
microarray technique, this laboratory previously identified 148
genes positively regulated by T3 in a TRa1 overexpressing hepatoma cell line (HepG2-TRa1). However, the other genes negatively
regulated by TR were largely unexamined. Increasing evidence
suggests that aberrant TR regulation or mutant TR genes may
be associated with human neoplasia (4). Previously, Lin et al. (5)
reported truncated TRa1 and TRh1 cDNA in 53% of human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). A high incidence of multiple point
mutations was observed in these mutated TRs. Other groups (6, 7)
have reported mutated TRs in HCC and cultured cells. This study
focused on a set of genes (i.e., oncogenes) normally repressed by TR
but aberrantly induced because of reduced TR expression or
mutation during carcinogenesis.
The pituitary tumor transforming gene 1 (PTTG1) is a multifunctional gene encoding a 23-kDa, 202–amino acid protein that
induces cell transformation in NIH3T3 cells and tumor formation
in nude mice (8). Furthermore, PTTG1 is involved in liver regeneration (9) and is overexpressed in the hepatoma cell lines (10).
Additionally, previous microarray analysis showed that TR negatively regulated PTTG1. However, PTTG1 regulation by T3 has not
been fully characterized, and its pathogenic implications in hepatomas are largely unknown. This study therefore examined the
transcriptional regulation of the PTTG1 gene by TR and its
physiologic significance.
This study shows that T3 down-regulates PTTG1 expression in
HCC cells. Moreover, the promoter activity of the PTTG1 is
repressed by T3. Serial deletion of the promoter and electrophoretic
mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed to locate the Sp1 sites
on the PTTG1 promoter. Finally, the possible physiologic functions
of such regulation were elucidated.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. The human hepatoma cell lines HepG2, Hep3B, Huh7, J7,
and Mahlavu were routinely grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v)
fetal bovine serum. Serum was depleted of T3 as described elsewhere (11).
Cells were cultured at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and
5% CO2.
Immunoblot analysis. Cell lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE on a
10% gel; the separated proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose
membrane (Amersham), as described elsewhere (12). Antibodies included
rabbit polyclonal antibody to PTTG1 (Zymed) and Sp1 and Sp3 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). C4, a mouse monoclonal antibody against TRa1 and TRh1,
was a gift from Sheue-yann Cheng (National Cancer Institute).
Northern blot analysis. Total RNA was extracted from cells using Trizol
reagent. Equal quantities of total RNA (20 Ag) were separated on a
denaturing gel (1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel) as described previously (13).

The gel was then blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and subjected to
Northern blot analysis, as described previously (12).
Cloning the PTTG1 5¶ flanking region and promoter activity assay.
Fragments of the PTTG1 promoter (nucleotides 2,512 to +52) were
amplified via PCR according to the published nucleotide sequence (8) and
then inserted into the pA3TK-Luc vector. Mutations of Sp1 binding sites
were also constructed (D 620/ 512). The promoter construct sequence
was verified by automated DNA sequencing. To measure the influence of T3
on the transcriptional activity of the PTTG1 promoter, HepG2-TRa1#1 cells
(1  105 per 12-well plate) were cotransfected via a Lipofectamine protocol
using 1.2 Ag/well of pA3TK-luc vector containing PTTG1 promoter
sequences (Invitrogen Corp.). The Sp1 expression plasmid was kindly
provided by Hung, Jan-Jong (National Cheng Kung University). Cells were
also cotransfected with 0.33 Ag of the h-galactosidase expression vector,
pSVh plasmid (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.), as described elsewhere (12).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The PTTG1 promoter fragment
( 620 to 512) was amplified and labeled with [a-32P] dCTP (3,000 Ci/
mmol; Amersham) via PCR for use as a probe. The PTTG1 promoter
fragment ( 925 to 817) served as a control. For the EMSA, an equal
amount of in vitro–translated (Promega) Sp1 protein or nuclear extract (14)
was incubated with [a-32P]–labeled PTTG1 fragments, as described
elsewhere (13). MOPC21, a mouse monoclonal antibody, was used as a
negative control (Sigma-Aldrich).
Quantitative reverse transcription–PCR. Total cellular RNA was
extracted by Trizol, as described elsewhere. Subsequently, cDNA was
synthesized using the Superscript II kit for reverse transcription–PCR (RTPCR; Life Technologies), as described previously (15). Real-time quantitative
RT-PCR (Q-RT-PCR) was conducted, as described previously (15).
Experimental animals and human specimens. In accordance with
techniques described elsewhere, thyroidectomy (Tx) was performed on two
groups of 6-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 10), and sham
operations were performed on one group of 6-week-old male rats (n = 6;
ref. 12). All animal experiments in this study complied with NIH guidelines
and the Chang-Gung Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee Guide
for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Additionally, 65 patients with HCC diagnosed between 2000 and 2003
were consecutively selected for this study. The study protocol was approved
by the Medical Ethics and Human Clinical Trial Committee at Chang-Gung
Memorial Hospital.
Recombinant adenovirus and infection. The PTTG1 cDNA were
subcloned into the XhoI site of the vector pAdTrack-CMV (16), a gift from
B. Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University). The resulting construct was
sequenced, linearized, and cotransformed with pAdEasy1 into BJ5183
competent bacteria to generate recombinant pAdEasy1-PTTG1. Recombinant viruses were produced by transfecting linearized pAdEasy1-PTTG1
into 293 cells via a Lipofectamine method. Cells growing in log phase were
infected with either empty or PTTG1 adenovirus for 40 h. Subsequently, the
cell proliferation rate was assayed.
Establishing TRs/PTTG1/Sp1 knockdown stable HCC cell lines. The
clones (V2HS_28556) of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting PTTG1,
and shRNA (NM_004219) for Sp1 were obtained from GENDISCOVERY
(Open Biosystems). Additionally, the clone (TRCN000002039) of shRNA
targeting TRa1 and the clone shRNA (TRCN0000020344) for TRb1 were
purchased from National RNA Interference Core Facility (Institute of
Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica). Transfection of shRNA for the
targeting of endogenous PTTG1/Sp1/TRs genes was performed using
Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). After 24 h of incubation, cells were
transferred to medium containing puromycin for selection. After 2 wk of
selection, specific repression of the targeted gene was confirmed by Western
blot analysis.
Detection of cell cycle phase by propidium iodide staining. Cells
were harvested after 12 h of culture in the 6-cm dishes, washed once in PBS,
centrifuged, and fixed in 70% ethanol for 24 h at 4jC. The nuclei were
stained with propidium iodide (50 Ag/mL) after treatment with 0.5% TritonX100/PBS containing 0.05% DNase-free RNase, and the DNA content was
analyzed by flow cytometry using the fluorescence-activated cell sorting
Aria cell sorting system (Becton Dickinson). The percentage of cells in each

phase of the cell cycle was determined using the Modfit LT program (Verity
Software House).
Cell proliferation assay. Cells (3  103) were grown in a 96-well plate at
37jC with 5% CO2. At each time point, growth rate of cell was determined
by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
method or by cell number counting. Absorbance was read at 570 nm, and
background absorbance at 660 nm was subtracted in a Titertek Multiscan
Plus MK1-ELISA reader (Labsystems and Life Sciences International Ltd.).
Results are given in fold change of each control value.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was carried out with the help of
the Statistical Package for Social Science, version 13.0 (SPSS, Inc.).

Results
Effects of T3 on PTTG1 mRNA and protein expression in
HepG2 cells. In the four HepG2 cell lines investigated in this study
(HepG2-TRa1#1, HepG2-TRa1#2, HepG2-TRh1, and HepG2-Neo),
overexpression of TR protein was f10-fold, 3-fold, and 3.2-fold
that of the HepG2-Neo control cell line (Fig. 1A). Overexpressed
PTTG1 protein and mRNA were compared between various HepG2
cell lines after incubation with or without T3 for varying durations
(Fig. 1B and C). The thyroid hormone T3 suppressed expression
of PTTG1 in HepG2-TRa1#1, HepG2-TRa1#2 (data not shown), and
HepG2-TRh1 cells to a greater extent than in HepG2-Neo cells
(Fig. 1B). Protein levels in PTTG1 decreased 14% to 84% after
incubation of HepG2-TRa1#1, HepG2-TRa1#2 (data not shown),
and HepG2-TRh1 cells with T3 (10 and 100 nmol/L) for 24, 48, and
72 hours, respectively. These experimental results show the timedependent properties of T3. However, the repression of PTTG1 by
T3 was maximized at f10 nmol/L (Fig. 1B).
The effect of T3 on the expression of PTTG1 mRNA was
examined by Northern blot analysis. A 0.6-kb PTTG1 mRNA was
detected in three examined cell lines (Fig. 1C). Exposure of HepG2TRa1#1 cells and HepG2-TRh1 cells to 10 and 100 nmol/L T3 for 24,
48, and 72 hours, respectively, produced a dose-dependent decrease
(63–87%) in PTTG1 mRNA. Furthermore, the repression by T3 was
almost maximal at 24 h. Additionally, the effect of T3 on PTTG1
mRNA expression in HepG2-Neo cells was minimal (Fig. 1C). These
experimental results thus suggest that the effect of T3 on PTTG1
protein expression is mediated, at least partly, at the transcription
level.
Knockdown of TRs expression abolished repression of
PTTG1 by T3. To determine whether the PTTG1 repression is
indeed TR dependent, TR protein expression was knocked down by
RNA interference in four HCC cell lines. Huh7, J7, and Mahlavu
expressed endogenous TRa1 and TRh1 proteins (Fig. 1A). The
small interfering RNA (siRNA) expression vectors encoding antisense TRa1 or TRh1 sequences and a control plasmid with a
scrambled sequence were transfected into each cell line. Figure 1A
depicts the expression of TR proteins in four TR knockdown (KD)
and control (Neo) cell lines. The data indicate that RNA interference repressed the expression of almost all the TR proteins.
Subsequently, the repression of Sp1 or PTTG1 by T3 was diminished in the KD but not in the control Neo cell lines (Fig. 1D).
These experimental results show that TRs are a crucial determinant of T3 repressive ability.
Localization of a negative regulatory region in the PTTG1
promoter. To further clarify the regulatory effect of T3 on PTTG1
mRNA expression, cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, was
introduced. The effect of T3 on PTTG1 mRNA expression in the
presence or absence of cycloheximide was determined in HepG2TRa1#1 cells. Blocking of protein repression with cycloheximide

Regulation of PTTG1 by Thyroid Hormone

effectively abolished transcriptional repression of PTTG1 by 10
nmol/L T3. This experimental result suggests that the effect of T3
on PTTG1 regulation may be indirect (data not shown). To
determine whether the T3-induced repression of PTTG1 mRNA in
HepG2 cells is mediated by an indirect effect of TR on PTTG1
transcription, the fragment of the PTTG1 promoter encompassing
nucleotides 2,512 to +52 (relative to the translational initiation
site) was cloned and inserted into a pA3TK-luc vector (containing a
minimum thymidine kinase promoter). Serial truncated mutants of
the PTTG1 promoter fragment (based on the 2,512/+52 construct;
Fig. 2A) were also constructed and transfected into HepG2-TRa1
cells. The transcriptional activity of the 2,512/+52, 1,000/+52,
and 1,000/ 500 constructs was reduced by f45% to 58.5% in the
presence of T3 (Fig. 2A) compared with the activity of the pA3TKluc vector. To further delineate the promoter region involved in this

marked inhibition of transcriptional activity by T3, the PTTG1
promoter sequences from nucleotides 1,000 to 500 were
analyzed to identify binding sites from the transcription factor
database (TFSEARCH: Searching Transcription Factor Binding
Sites). This region includes two AP1 binding sites ( 921 and 733),
two Sp1 binding sites ( 594 and 520), and one NF1 binding site
( 511; Fig. 2B). Additionally, computer analysis revealed no TREs
in this PTTG1 promoter region. To further determine the pivotal
nuclear transcription factor binding sites on the PTTG1 promoter
regulated by T3, the promoter was further divided into seven
fragments including 1,000/ 553, 1,000/ 595, 620/ 553,
553/ 487, 620/ 512, 513/+52, and 500/+52. As Fig. 2A
shows, T3 reduced by 29.5% to 55% the promoter activity of only
the 1,000/ 553, 620/ 553, 553/ 487, and 620/ 512 fragments (in HepG2-TRa1 cells; Fig. 2A). Those fragments contain at

TRa1-specific or TRh1-specific RNA interference as described in Materials and Methods. Expression of TR proteins in four cell lines without (Neo) or with (KD) specific
TR RNA interference transfection. PTTG1 expression was repressed by T3 at protein (B ) or mRNA levels (C ). The TR stable lines were incubated with T3-depleted
(Td ) medium in the absence or presence of 10 or 100 nmol/L T3 for 24, 48, or 72 h. Cell lysates (100 Ag of protein) were then subjected to immunoblot analysis
with polyclonal antibody to PTTG1. Alternatively, total RNA (20 Ag/lane) was then isolated and sequentially analyzed by Northern blot using the 32P-labeled cDNA probe
of PTTG1 and 18S rRNA. D, TR-dependent repression of PTTG1/Sp1 expression by T3. Cells were incubated with T3-depleted medium in the absence or presence

Figure 2. Regulation of PTTG1 expression by Sp1 at the transcriptional level. A, serial deletion of the PTTG1 5¶ or 3¶ flanking region reporter constructs in the
pA3TK-luc vector (1.2 Ag/well) were transfected in HepG2-TRa1 cells. After transfection, cells were harvested after 24 h with or without 10 nmol/L T3 treatment.
All the promoter constructs were inserted into the pA3TK-luc vector that contains a minimal thymidine kinase (TK ) promoter. The designation D 620/ 512 indicates
mutated Sp1 binding site. The promoter activities were calculated relative to each 0 nmol/L T3 (+T3/ T3) and further normalized to the pA3TK-luc control, as well
as h-galactosidase activities (T3-induced change in normalized h-gal activity). Columns, mean obtained from at least three independent experiments performed in

least one Sp1 binding site. However, deletion of the Sp1 binding at
594 (Fig. 2B; 553/ 487, Fig. 2A) or 520 (Fig. 2B; 620/ 553,
Fig. 2A) did not significantly affect the transcription repression
activity of T3. Notably, transcription activity was induced rather
than abolished completely when two Sp1 sites ( 1,000/ 595,
513/+52, 500/+52) were deleted. Furthermore, deletion of AP1
and NF1 binding sites ( 620/ 512) did not alter the repressive
effect of T3 on the PTTG1 promoter. However, the repression effect
was diminished by mutation of these critical sites (D 620/ 512).
These experimental results strongly suggest the involvement of Sp1
or its related factor and show the important role of Sp1 in T3
regulation of PTTG1 promoter activity. Taken together, our data
indicate that the repression of PTTG1 promoter activity by T3 is
mediated by Sp1.
T3-reduced Sp1 expression in HepG2-TRA1 cells. Immunoblotting or Q-RT-PCR was performed to determine whether Sp1
or Sp1-related Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4 transcription factor is repressed
by T3/TR and subsequently represses PTTG1 expression. Clearly,
no T3 repression of Sp2 or Sp4 was observed by Q-RT-PCR,
whereas Sp3 expression was reduced after 72 h of T3 treatment
(Fig. 3A). The Sp1 protein levels decreased f71.5% after
incubation with 10 nmol/L T3 for 48 hours. Furthermore, cells
incubated in 100 nmol/L T3 for 48 hours revealed slightly
increased (88%) repression of Sp1 protein expression. Moreover,
after 72 hours of incubation in 100 nmol/L T3, Sp1 expression was

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (6). March 15, 2008

almost completely repressed (>90%; Fig. 3B). Concomitantly,
PTTG1 protein levels also decreased f70% to 85% after
incubation of HepG2-TRa1#1 cells with 10 or 100 nmol/L T3 for
48 or 72 hours (Fig. 3B). However, this phenomenon was not
observed in HepG2-Neo cells (Fig. 3C).
Overexpression of Sp1 activates PTTG1 promoter activity.
To clarify whether Sp1 is crucial in T3 regulation of PTTG1
promoter activity, a Sp1 expression vector (in pcDNA3 vector) was
cotransfected with the PTTG1 promoters noted in Fig. 2A. As
Fig. 4A shows, the transfection of Sp1 expression vector in T3depleted as well as in 10 nmol/L T3 medium increased PTTG1
promoter activity f4-fold to 6-fold in PTTG1 promoter fragments
containing Sp1 ( 1,000/+52, 1,000/ 500, 1,000/ 553, 620/
553, 553/ 487, and 620/ 512) but had no effect on PTTG1
promoter fragments containing non-Sp1 or mutated Sp1 binding
site ( 1,000/ 595, D 620/ 512, 513/+52, and 500/+52; Fig.
4A). These data indicate that overexpressed Sp1 may activate the
PTTG1 promoter in HepG2-TRa1 cells with or without T3. Also, Sp1
apparently does not increase PTTG1 promoter activity if Sp1
binding sites have undergone mutation (D 620/ 512).
To verify that Sp1 protein target Sp1 sites directly, a fragment
containing two Sp1 sites was used as an EMSA probe. Reactions
performed with [a-32P] labeled 620 to 512 fragment and
in vitro–translated Sp1 protein produced one predominant band
(Fig. 4B, lane 3). Sp1 antibody (Fig. 4B, lane 4) but not control

antibody (MOPC21; Fig. 4B, lane 5) specifically supershifted the
band. Moreover, this band was competed out by adding 10 times
molar excess of cold probe (Fig. 4B, lane 6) but not nonspecific cold
probe (Fig. 4B, lane 7). However, if the Sp1 binding sites in the 620
to 512 region mutated (DSp1), Sp1 binding activity was lost
(Fig. 4B, lane 8). TR proteins with or without retinoid X receptor
(RXR) did not bind to this region (Fig. 4B, lanes 9–14). To further
characterize whether TRa/h indirectly binds to PTTG1 promoter
via complex formation with Sp1, supershift assay of the DNAprotein complex was performed using Sp1 antibodies (Fig. 4B, lanes
16, 20, 24, and 28) or C4 (TRa/h; Fig. 4B, lanes 17, 21, 25, and 29) or
control antibodies (MOPC21; Fig. 4B, lanes 18, 22, 26, and 30). The
results indicate that the complex was supershifted by Sp1 but not
C4 antibody, and only Sp1 protein bound to the 620 to 512
fragment. Similar results were observed when HepG2 nuclear
extracts were used (Fig. 4C). Briefly, one predominant band was
detected (Fig. 4C, lane 2) when using [a-32P]-labeled 620 to 512
fragment. This band was specifically supershifted by the Sp1
antibody (lane 3) but not by the Sp3 antibody (lane 4) or C4
(lane 5) or the control antibody (lane 6). However, if using the
mutated probe (DSp1), Sp1 binding activity was lost (Fig. 4C,
lane 7). Additionally, the band could not be competed out by
adding 10 times molar excess of nonspecific cold probe (Fig. 4C,
lane 8) but by specific cold probe (Fig. 4C, lane 9). These experimental results suggest that the factor binding to the 620 to 512
on PTTG1 promoter is Sp1-specific, but not Sp3-specific. The
promoter assay and EMSA findings suggest that Sp1 activates
PTTG1 gene transcription by directly binding to the Sp1 sites
located between 620 and 512 bp (Fig. 4).

T3 represses PTTG1 and Sp1 protein expression in vivo.
Surgical Tx was performed in two groups of 6-week-old male
Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 10 per group) to determine the in vivo
responses of PTTG1 and Sp1 to T3 treatment. One group (Tx + T3)
was injected with T3 daily for 2 weeks; the second group (Tx)
received no T3 injections; the third group was sham-operated
controls. The rats were sacrificed at the end of the experiment
(4 weeks after thyroidectomized), and serum was collected for T3
and TSH determination. The livers were removed for Western blot
analysis. The T3 serum levels in the Tx group were f0.022-fold
(12.3 versus 548.1 ng/dL) than those in the group that received T3
treatment (Tx + T3). Levels of TSH in the Tx group were f67.2-fold
(2.42 versus 0.036 ng/mL) than those of the T3-treated group.
The T3 and TSH serum levels in the sham group were f48.1 ng/dL
and 0.197 ng/mL, respectively. Western blot analysis showed that
repression of PTTG1 and Sp1 protein levels in the Tx + T3 group
were 76% and 61%, respectively, that of the Tx group. The PTTG1
and Sp1 protein levels in the sham group were 32% and 28%,
respectively, that of the Tx group (Fig. 5A).
Furthermore, the clinicopathologic significance of PTTG1
expression in HCC was also investigated. In total, 65 patients with
HCC were consecutively selected for this study. An equal amount
(100 Ag) of protein from each specimen was loaded for electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. Equal loading was confirmed
by Coomassie blue staining after SDS-PAGE (data not shown). The
PTTG1 and Sp1 proteins were detected in most of the cancerous
tissues. The results from 23 representative paired HCC specimens
are shown in Fig. 5B, indicating the increased PTTG1/Sp1 expression and the concomitantly decreased TR protein expression in

HCC tissues. The percentage of all paired samples with upregulated PTTG1 and Sp1 was 47.7% (31 of 65) and 64.6% (42 of 65)
in the cancerous tissues, respectively, relative to the matched
noncancerous adjacent tissues. Additionally, TRa1 and TRh1 were
reduced in 70.8% (46 of 65) and 55.4% (36 of 65) of the cancerous
tissues, respectively. Linear regression analysis revealed a significantly positive correlation between the tumor/normal (T/N) ratios
of PTTG and Sp1 [b = 0.531; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of
b, 0.323–0.940; P < 0.0001]. Concomitantly, significantly negative
correlations were observed between the T/N ratios of (a) PTTG
and TRa (b = 2.778; 95% CI of b, 4.125 to 1.431; P < 0.0001),
(b) PTTG and TRh (b = 1.373; 95% CI of b, 2.172 to 0.573;
P = 0.001), (c) Sp1 and TRa (b = 2.824; 95% CI of b, 4.139 to
1.510; P < 0.0001), and (d) Sp1 and TRh (b = 1.334; 95% CI
of b, 2.123 to 0.544; P = 0.001). Thus, the expression of both
PTTG1 and Sp1 was inversely correlated with the expression of TR
proteins in HCCs (Fig. 5B).
Knockdown of Sp1 or PTTG1 expression inhibits HepG2TRA1 cell growth. To further study PTTG1 function in HCC,
PTTG1 expression was repressed by siRNA. The siRNA expression
vectors encoding antisense PTTG1 sequences and a control plasmid with a scrambled sequence were transfected into HepG2-TRa1
cells. Figure 6A depicts the expression of PTTG1 in two HepG2TRa1 knockdown (PTTG1 KD#1 and PTTG1 KD#2; lanes 2 and 3)
and one control (HepG2-TRa1-Neo; lane 1) stable cell line. Additionally, Sp1 knockdown (Sp1 KD#1 and Sp1 KD#2; Fig. 6A, lanes 5
and 6) and control (HepG2-TRa1-Luc; lane 4) stable cell lines
were prepared. Reduced Sp1 concomitantly suppressed PTTG1
expression (Fig. 6A, lanes 5 and 6), demonstrating that Sp1 is
specifically down-regulated by T3 and subsequently decreases
PTTG1 expression in HepG2-TRa1 cells. The two PTTG1-knockdown stable lines (#1 and #2), as well as the two Sp1 KD stable
lines (#1 and #2) grew significantly (P < 0.01) more slowly than
did the control HepG2-TRa1-Neo or HepG2-TRa1-Luc cell lines
(Fig. 6B), suggesting that PTTG1 or Sp1 positively regulates cell
proliferation.
Ectopic overexpression of PTTG1 promotes cell proliferation in Hep3B hepatoma cells. The Hep3B cells expressing low
levels of endogenous PTTG1 were infected with adenovirus
encoding PTTG1. After 40 hours of infection, PTTG1 expression
in infected cells was determined. Figure 6A shows that PTTG1
expression in two Hep3B-PTTG1 sublines (#1 and #2; Fig. 6A, lanes
9, 10) was higher than in noninfected cells or in cells infected with
control GFP vector (Fig. 6A, lanes 7 and 8). To determine the effect
of PTTG1 overexpression in Hep3B cells, cell proliferation was
determined by MTT assay or cell number counting (data not
shown) at 24 to 120 h after adenovirus-PTTG1 infection. The
adenovirus-PTTG1-infected cells exhibited significantly higher
proliferation rates than uninfected cells or cells infected with
control GFP vector, whereas cell proliferation was very similar in
both control cells (Fig. 6C). These experiments indicate that
overexpression of PTTG1 can induce cell proliferation in Hep3B
hepatoma cells.
Figure 6D illustrates that knockdown PTTG1 or Sp1 expression
increased the percentage of cells in the G0-G1 phases by f1.3fold or 1.6-fold, respectively. The increase in cell number in G0-G1
phases was simultaneous with the decrease in the percentage of
S-phase cells in PTTG1 KD and Sp1 KD. Conversely, overexpression of PTTG1 in Hep3B cells accelerated cell growth by
reducing the number of cells in G0-G1 phases roughly 71% (43.8 of
61.82).

Discussion
This study characterized PTTG1, which was previously identified
in cDNA microarray screening for T3-responsive genes in HepG2TRa1 cells. The regulation of PTTG1 by T3 and the significance of
this regulation in HCC have not been reported. This study
examined the molecular mechanism of PTTG1 regulation by T3
in isogenic HepG2 cell lines and its physiologic significance. The
experimental results indicate that PTTG1 regulation by T3 is
indirect and mediated by Sp1. Further study showed that T3 downregulates Sp1 expression. Additionally, exogenous transfection of
Sp1 expression vector into HepG2-TR cells increased PTTG1
promoter activity. Furthermore, promoter activity analysis showed
that two important Sp1 sites at 594 and 520 upstream of human
PTTG1 participate in T3-induced change in human PTTG1 gene
transcription. Observation of a similar regulatory process observed
in thyroidectomized rat specimens is consistent with these
findings. Notably, the expression of PTTG1 and Sp1 was inversely
correlated with the expression of TR proteins in HCCs. Moreover,
the experimental data clearly show that negative regulation of
PTTG1 by T3 is mediated by reduced Sp1 expression. Transcription
factors other than Sp1, such as NF-Y, also regulate PTTG1 expression (17). Both Sp1 and NF-Y are essential in the transcriptional
regulation of the human PTTG gene. However, the regulation of
NF-Y by T3 was not observed (data not shown); therefore, NF-Y is
not involved in T3 repression.
Furthermore, T3 had a minimal effect on the quantity of PTTG1
mRNA in HepG2-Neo cells. Knockdown of TRs expression
abolished the repression of PTTG1 by T3. Thus, the effect of T3
on PTTG1 protein repression is apparently TR-dependent and
mediated, at least partly, at the mRNA level. Ying et al. (18) and
Furuya et al. (19) reported that PTTG1 is physically associated with
TRh1 or mutant TRh1 in vivo. Additionally, PTTG1 directly interacts with the ligand-bound TRh1 and with the steroid receptor
coactivator-3 that recruits a proteasome activator (PA28g).
Subsequently, association with the above-mentioned complex
induced the degradation of PTTG1 in association with the wildtype TRh1-dependent receptor but not the mutant receptor.
However, this study shows that the reduced expression of PTTG1
was largely due to down-regulation of Sp1 by T3. The experimental
results of this study extend and supplement those of Ying et al. The
PTTG1 is largely down-regulated at the transcriptional level
according to the current findings. The remainder is regulated at
the protein level as reported by Ying et al.
Overexpression of PTTG1 enhances the cell proliferation,
migration, invasion, and/or tumorigenicity of cells derived from
cancers of the human pituitary, esophagus, breast, thyroid, lung,
head, and neck, as well as uterine leiomyomas, glioma, and pituitary adenomas (20–28). Earlier studies indicate that T3 significantly
suppresses the growth of HepG2-TR overexpressing cells (29).
However, T3 repression was not observed in the control cell line
(HepG2-Neo), which did not express detectable TR. The suppressive effect is mediated at least partly by down-regulation of
PTTG1 observed in this study because overexpression of PTTG1
is associated with cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and poor prognosis in HCC (30). After all, the expression of PTTG1 is very low in
normal cells.
The Sp1 protein plays an important role in the growth and
invasion of cancer cells (31, 32). The overexpression of Sp1 is often
negatively associated with survival rates in several cancers (33, 34).
Sp1 has been reported to be overly expressed in gastric cancer

(KD#1 and KD#2) expressed low levels of PTTG1 protein. Additionally, the expression of Sp1 was also repressed by siRNA in HepG2-TRa1 cells. Two clones (KD#1
and KD#2) expressed low levels of Sp1 protein. The PTTG1 protein expression levels were also reduced. Furthermore, the Hep3B hepatoma cells were
infected by adenovirus or adenovirus-PTTG1 for 40 h. PTTG1 expression was assayed by immunoblot with polyclonal antibody to PTTG1. The PTTG1 or Sp1
knockdown HepG2-TRa1 cells (B) and PTTG1-overexpressed Hep3B cells (C ) were incubated in growth medium for 24 to 120 h, and cell proliferation was assayed

tissue and negatively expressed in adjacent noncancerous tissue
(35). The Sp1 protein is the major transcription factor of several
genes associated with proliferation or invasion (36). Recently, Tong
et al. (37) indicated that PTTG1 apparently interacts with Sp1, and
full-length PTTG1 positively regulates Sp1 activity. Additionally,
Sp1 regulates PTTG1. Tong et al. therefore proposed the existence
of an auto-feedback mechanism between Sp1 and PTTG1.
Consistent with previous reports (36, 38), the overexpression of
PTTG1 in HCC in this study was observed with concomitant
overexpression of Sp1 in vitro, as well as in vivo. Moreover, Sp1, but
not Sp2, or Sp4 was also negatively regulated by T3 at protein and
mRNA levels. Therefore, TRs may play a suppressor role by
reducing PTTG1 and Sp1 expression in normal liver. However,
when TRs expression is reduced in HCC, TRs lose their tumor
suppressor role during hepatocarcinogenesis. Thus, alleviation of
repression leads to induction of PTTG1 or Sp1 overexpression.
However, in some cases, the inverse correlation was not observed
because of possible deletion or mutation of TR genes (5).

Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms of this phenomenon require
further study. In conclusion, this investigation showed that
overexpression of PTTG1 or Sp1 in some HCCs is TR dependent
and might play a crucial role in the development of HCC (39). Also,
ligand-activated TR indirectly transactivates PTTG1 gene transcription through critical Sp1 binding sites located within the
5¶ flanking region of the gene. Moreover, alteration of PTTG1
expression through overexpression by adenovirus or through underexpression by siRNA causes changes in cell proliferation. Clearly, a
suppressor role of TR during liver carcinogenesis can be postulated.
