ABSTRACT
Metastasis causes a large number of deaths among esophageal cancer patients.
The activation of RAF family proteins elevates tumor metastasis and proliferation.
In screen targeting the RAF protein, we identified that Griffipavixanthone (GPX), a
dimeric xanthone isolated from Garcinia esculenta, is a B-RAF and C-RAF inhibitor
against esophageal cancer cells. Using wound healing, transwell migration and
matrigel invasion assays, we confirmed that GPX significantly inhibited cell migration
and invasion. Furthermore, exposure to GPX rendered cell proliferation and induced
G2/M cell cycle arrest. Our mechanistic study showed that GPX suppressed cancer
metastasis and proliferation through downregulation of RAF-MEK-ERK cascades
proteins as well as RAF mRNA levels. In a pulmonary metastasis model, the
intraperitoneal injection of GPX significantly suppressed esophageal tumor metastasis
and ERK protein level in vivo. In conclusion, our present study suggested that GPX
could inhibit tumor migration, invasion and proliferation in vitro and in vivo, which
indicated the potential of GPX for preventing and treating esophageal cancer.

approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),
Sorafenib (SFB), inhibited cell proliferation that was
stimulated by acid or bile acid treatments in esophageal
adenocarcinoma by abrogating MAPK activation [10, 11].
Therefore, targeting this cascade seems to be a good
choice for treating esophageal cancer metastasis and
proliferation [8, 12, 13].
Currently, natural plant-derived compounds are a
leading source for drug development [14, 15]. According
to our earlier studies, compounds isolated from Garcinia
species are able to promote apoptosis [16], induce
cell cycle arrest [17], and inhibit autophagic flux [18].
Our recent study exhibited the antimetastic effect of
oblongifolin C isolated from Garcinia yunnanensis Hu
by upregulating Keratin 18 and tubulins [19]. All these
suggested that compounds from Garcinia species contain
multiple anticancer activities. In the present study, we
performed a screen targeting B-RAF and C-RAF in a high
metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma cell line TE1 using
our own library. We identified that Griffipavixanthone

INTRODUCTION
Esophageal adenocarcinoma is the seventh most
common tumor that leads to human mortality, and its
incidence rate is increasing in China [1–3]. Esophageal
adenocarcinoma contains two major forms: squamous
cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma, of which
over 90% are SCCs [4]. Cancer metastasis is the cause of
most patients’ death [5], and little progress has been made
because of it is a complicated process. For years, great
efforts have been taken to treat esophageal cancer [6, 7];
however, due to its aggressiveness and lack of sensitivity
to chemotherapy, its treatment remains a challenge.
The RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway is involved in
cell proliferation, metastasis and cell survival [8]. High
expression of ERK in esophageal cancer leads to a more
aggressive phenotype in clinicopathology [9], resulting in
tumor malignance. Nevertheless, few studies have been
conducted in esophageal SCCs to evaluate this pathway.
Recent studies have shown that the first RAF inhibitor

the motility and proliferation of esophageal SCC cell
lines, suggesting that GPX had a potential application in
esophageal cancer cell prevention and therapy.

analysis showed that GPX caused G2/M cell cycle arrest
in TE1 and KYSE150 cells (Figure 2C). Additionally, we
examined the effect on another esophageal cell Eca109.
As shown in Supplementary Figure S2A and S2B, GPX
induced G0/1 arrest on Eca109 within 48 h. To access
the effects on GPX on cell death, we applied MTT assay,
SYBRE-Green assay, morphology observation, and PI/
Annexin-V double staining. As shown in Supplementary
Figure S3 and S4, GPX did not cause cell death in all the
tested conditions. In short conclusion, GPX exhibits tumor
suppression effects on metastasis and proliferation without
obvious cytotoxicity in vitro.

RESULTS
GPX inhibits migration and invasion in TE1 and
KYSE150
Because RAF family proteins play essential roles
in regulating tumor metastasis and proliferation, we first
attempted to screen B-RAF and C-RAF inhibitors from
our own Garcinia plant compound library using western
blotting analysis. The library compounds were obtained
from several species of the genus Garcinia (Guttiferae)
collected from China [21]. As shown in Figure 1A,
exposure to some of the compounds in TE1 cells caused
the suppression of B-RAF and C-RAF (please refer to
Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Figure S1 for
compounds information). Compounds 1, 2, 5, 8, 12 and 13
exhibited strong inhibition effects compared to the positive
control SFB. Among these compounds, compounds 1, 2,
5, 12 and 13 had a strong potential to induce cell death in
various cancer cells in our previous study. Interestingly,
GPX (compound 8, see Figure 1B for structure) reduced the
expression of B-RAF and C-RAF with minor cytotoxicity
in several esophageal cancer cells (Supplementary
Figure S2). We then chose GPX to further study its effect
on cell migration and invasion. In the wound healing assay,
GPX inhibited TE1 and KYSE150 cell migration in a dose
dependent manner (Figure 1C). Furthermore, transwell
migration and the matrigel invasion assay indicated that
GPX efficiently suppressed cell migration and invasion
(Figure 1D). The inhibition of GPX at 10 μM was 48 ±
17% on TE1 for migration and 47 ± 9% for invasion (Figure
1E, upper panel). Similarly, migrated cells of KYSE150
decreased by 42 ± 9% and invaded cells decreased by
55 ± 15% when treated with GPX at 10 μM (Figure 1E,
lower panel). These data suggest that GPX suppressed
the expression of B-RAF and C-RAF and esophageal cell
metastasis in vitro.

GPX prevents pulmonary metastasis in a mouse
model
We then explored the metastatic inhibition effect
of GPX in vivo using the tail vein injection pulmonary
metastasis mouse model. After KYSE150 cells injection,
the mice were randomly divided into three groups and
administered DMSO, GPX or 5-FU via intraperitoneal
injection (n = 8 in each group). Thirty-five days after
tumor injection, the mice were sacrificed, and the
pulmonary metastasis was examined by HE and
immunohistochemistry staining. As shown in the upper
panel of Figure 3A, lung tumor nodules were observed in
the control group, whereas both GPX and 5-FU reduced
the tumor nodules. As shown in the lower panel, HE
staining showed the large size of the metastatic foci in
the control group and showed that the foci were sparse
and smaller in mice treated with GPX and 5-FU, which
was confirmed by the statistical analysis in Figure 3B.
Additionally, the weight of the lungs in the GPX and
5-FU treated groups decreased significantly compared to
that in the control group (Figure 3C). Consistent with
the in vitro experiments, GPX did not cause significant
side effects to the mice because only a minor reduction
in weight loss was observed (Figure 3D). To investigate
the effects of GPX on cell cycle and cell death, we
performed immunohistochemistry to detect phosphoERK, Ki67 and TUNEL staining in the lung tissues.
As shown in Figure 3E, phospho-ERK and Ki67 were
remarkably suppressed in both the GPX and 5-FU
treated groups. Other tissues including liver, kidney,
heart, and spleen did not show obvious morphological
changes (Supplementary Figure S5A). In addition, the
pathological analysis indicated that there was no liver
metastasis as shown in Supplementary Figure S5B.
In summary, our in vivo study indicated that GPX
suppressed pulmonary metastasis without significant side
effects against other organs in nude mice.

GPX inhibits colony formation and induces cell
cycle arrest
To investigate the effect of GPX on cell
proliferation, a colony formation assay was applied. As
shown in Figure 2A, TE1 and KYSE150 cells treated with
10 μM GPX for 48 h could not form colonies, indicating
that GPX inhibits the proliferation of these cell lines. We
then further explored the effects of GPX on the cell cycle
distribution. TE1 and KYSE150 cells were incubated with
various concentrations of GPX for 48 h and were analyzed
by flow cytometry with DNA staining. Dose-dependent
G2/M arrest was observed (Figure 2B), and the statistical

cells. As shown in Figure 4A and 4B, GPX decreased
the B-RAF, C-RAF, phospho-MEK and phospho-ERK
protein levels in a dose-dependent manner, without

significantly changing the protein level of total RAS,
MEK and ERK. A similar effect was also observed in
Eca109 cells (Supplementary Figure S2C). Similarly,
the B-RAF, C-RAF and phospho-MAPK protein levels

were attenuated in a time dependent manner after
treatment with 20 μM GPX (Figure 4C and 4D). We
also examined whether GPX influenced G2/M arrest
through the cyclinB1 protein. As shown in Figure 4,
GPX decreased the cyclinB1 protein levels in cancer
cells in a dose and time dependent manner. In TE1
and KYSE150, 5 μM and 10 μM of GPX, respectively,
decreased the protein levels. The effective times were

24 h and 12 h, respectively. We further investigated
the mRNA levels of B-RAF and C-RAF after GPX
treatment. Interestingly, these two mRNAs were
downregulated in both cell lines (Supplementary
Figure S6), indicating that GPX also affected B-RAF
and C-RAF at the transcriptional level. Furthermore,
we carefully compared the effects of GPX on migration,
cell cycle distribution, and the RAF-MAPK cascade

in Figure. 5A, treatment with GPX and Sorafenib
at a concentration of 20 μM could suppress TE1 and
KYSE150 cell migration. GPX and Sorafenib induced

a similar cell cycle arrest in TE1 and KYSE150 cells
(Figure 5B and 5C). Western blotting analysis showed
that B-RAF, C-RAF, phosphor-MEK, phosphor-ERK
and cyclinB1 were significantly decreased, whereas

GPX inhibits AKT and epithelial-mesenchymal

RAS was not affected by GPX or Sorafenib (Figure

inhibits the tumor metastatic capability and induces
cell cycle arrest by attenuating RAF-MAPK signaling
pathways.

metastasis in head and neck cancer [11]. We then checked
the effect of GPX on the phosphorylation of AKT in
TE1 and KYSE150 cells. As shown in Figure 6A and
Supplementary Figure S7, GPX caused a decrease in the
phosphorylation of AKT in both dose and time dependent
manners. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including
MMP-2 and MMP-9, play essential roles in regulating
tumor metastasis and angiogenesis [22]. We performed
quantitative RT-PCR to investigate the effect of GPX

on MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNA levels. As shown in
Supplementary Figure S8, GPX caused the decrease in
MMP-2 mRNA in a time-dependent manner, whereas the
MMP-9 mRNA was not altered significantly.
The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is
a fundamental process in embryogenesis, functioning
as a main character in cancer progression, including
endowing cells with migratory and invasive properties
[23]. E-cadherin, Vimentin, and Snail are three EMT

markers that regulate cell motility; Snail is a C2H2 zinc
finger protein that promotes EMT, whereas E-cadherin is
a cell adhesion molecule and Vimentin is a mesenchymal
marker [24]. We are curious how GPX regulates these
three proteins. Interestingly, GPX exhibited various
effects on TE1 and KYSE150 cells. As shown in Figure
6B and Supplementary Figure S9, GPX mainly decreased
Snail expression in TE1 cells and Vimentin experssion
in KYSE150 respectively. Nevertheless, GPX showed
a profound impact on multiple signaling pathways,
including metastasis, cell cycle arrest, and EMT.
In summary, our study indicated that GPX was an
interesting natural compound affecting multiple signals
in esophageal cancer in vitro and in vivo, as summarized
in Figure 6C. Our data suggested that GPX may be a
promising candidate to be developed as an anticancer
compound in cancer prevention and therapy.

be interesting to further investigate whether GPX can
regulate RAF through other mechanisms, such as protein
stabilities. Additionally, the detailed mechanisms on how
GPX affects cyclinB1 and EMT pathways also need to be
further explored.
GPX showed lower cytotoxicity than other
compounds, such as caged xanthones (e.g., Gambogic
acid) and PPAPs (e.g., Oblongifolin C, Guttiferone K),
in our preliminary study (data not shown). In our animal
study, TUNEL staining indicated that GPX did not cause
significant cell death in the xenograft tissue compared
to the positive control 5-FU (Figure 3E). Because GPX
is extracted from edible fruits, the data implicate that
this fruit might have the potential to be developed as a
functional food for cancer prevention or therapy. An
epidemiological study indicated that the incidence rates
of esophageal cancer are related to several factors, such
as cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, and dietary habits
[3]. It is still unclear if the uptake of the fruits is correlated
to the occurrence of esophageal cancer from the literature.
To elucidate whether the long term uptake of the fruits of
Garcinia esculenta can benefit cancer prevention, more
detailed studies in animal models are required.

DISCUSSION
The RAF-MEK-ERK pathway is an important
drug target in cancer therapy [13]. However, there have
been limited studies that have searched for RAF kinase
inhibitors from natural compounds. In the present study,
we tried to screen novel B-RAF and C-RAF inhibitors
from natural compounds using cell based western blotting
assays. We found that GPX was an efficient RAF inhibitor
without significant cytotoxicity. We then demonstrated
the anti-metastasis and anti-proliferation effects of GPX
on esophageal cancer in vitro and in vivo. Our further
studies indicated that GPX might be an effective inhibitor
of tumor metastasis, which was investigated by using
wound healing, transwell migration and invasion assays.
Simultaneously, we showed that GPX could decrease
cell colonies and trigger cell cycle arrest at the G2/M
phase. We also demonstrated that the mechanisms of
action of GPX included the inhibition of RAF-MAPK
signaling pathways, the decrease of cyclinB1, and the
downregulation of the EMT pathway.
Xanthones, benzophenone, and polycyclic
polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols (PPAPs) are the
major chemicals from Garcinia species plants containing
multiple bioactivities, including an anticancer effect
[25, 26]. We were curious whether the fruits contained
any effective compounds with anticancer potential. In
this study, we found a dimeric xanthone named GPX to
be an active metastatic inhibitor in esophageal cancers.
Our results indicated that GPX had a similar effect
to a commercial RAF inhibitor, Sorafinib (Figure 5).
However, in silico docking simulation suggested that
GPX might not directly bind to B-RAF or C-RAF due
to its large molecular weight (data not shown). Our data
also suggested that GPX inhibited the RAF pathway at
least partially through the downregulation of B-RAF and
C-RAF mRNA levels (Supplementary Figure S3). It will

Wound healing assay
Wound healing was used to evaluate cell motility.
Cells (1 × 105) were seeded into a 24-well culture plate.
When the cells grew to 80–90% confluence, a scratch
was created through the cell monolayer by sterile 100 μl
pipette tips, and fresh medium with or without GPX was
added. The cell migration was observed and imaged under
an IX83 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).

Transwell migration and invasion assay
Cell migration and invasion were estimated using
transwell chambers (Corning, NY, USA) with a pore size
of 8 μm. For the migration assay, a total of 5 × 104 cells
were added into the upper chamber in serum-free medium,
and in the bottom chamber, 600 μL of 10% FBS medium
was added. After incubating with various concentrations
of GPX for 24 h, the cells on the upper surface of the
chamber were removed using cotton swabs, and then, the
migrated cells on the bottom surface were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde, stained with 0.1% crystal violet and
scored under a light microscope in five random fields.
As for the transwell invasion assay, the upper chamber
membranes were pre-incubated with matrigel (BD
Biosciences, Bedford, MA, USA) for 2 hours at 37°C.

Western blot analysis
TE1 and KYSE150 cells were seeded on a 3.5cm dish, treated with GPX at various concentrations
and times, and lysed in RIPA buffer. Proteins were
separated on SDS polyacrylamide gels and transferred
to PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).
The membranes were blocked and immunoblotted
with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight, followed by
appropriate secondary antibodies. GAPDH was used as the
loading control. Membranes were visualized under Image
Quant LAS 4000 mini and processed by Image Quant TL
1D software (General Electric Company).
For transfected cells, 3 × 105 KYSE150 cells were
seeded in 6-well plate. After 24 h, they were transfected
with 2 μg plasmid and changed medium 6 h later. p-ERK
and ERK protein level were detected 24 h and 48 h later.
The primary antibodies C-RAF (Cat.9422),

GAPDH (Cat.5174), p-AKT (Ser473, Cat.9171), cyclinB1
(Cat.12231), E-cadherin (Cat.3195), vimentin (Cat.5741),
and snail (Cat.3879) were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technologies (Danvers, MA, USA). RAS (Cat.ab137739)
and B-RAF (Cat.ab33899) were purchased from Abcam
(Cambridge, UK).

Colony formation assay
For the colony formation assay, cells (500 per/well
for TE1 and 250 per/well for KYSE150) were seeded
in a 6-well culture plate and cultured for 7 days after
incubation with GPX for 48 h. The colonies were fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with 0.1% crystal violet
and imaged.

Flow cytometry
Cells (2 × 105) were plated in a 6-well culture plate
and maintained with GPX for 48 h. Then, the cells were
harvested, fixed in 70% cold ethanol and stored at 4°C
overnight. The cells were incubated with PI containing
RNaseA for 30 min and analyzed by Flow Cytometry (BD
Biosciences Inc., Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).
For FITC Annexin V and PI staining, cells were
harvested, suspended in 500 μl binding buffer and
incubated with 5 μl FITC Annexin V and 10 μl PI for
15 min. Then, the mixtures were detected under Flow
Cytometry.

Animal study, immunohistochemistry and
TUNEL assay
The in vivo study was performed as described
previously [28]. Briefly, 1 × 106 KYSE150 cells were
intravenously injected into six-week-old male nude
mice (Experimental Animal Center of the Chinese
Academy of Science, Shanghai, China). After injection
of esophageal cancer cells, the mice were divided into 3

groups randomly (n = 8 in each group) and DMSO, GPX
(20 mg/kg) or 5-FU (20 mg/kg) were administered via an
intraperitoneal injection every other day. Body weight
was measured every 2 days. At 35 days, the lungs were
removed and fixed in Bouin’s solution. The numbers of
lung nodules were counted and confirmed by HE staining.
The immunohistochemistry of p-ERK and Ki-67 were
performed in the lungs. A TUNEL assay was performed
to detect the fragmented DNA of the apoptotic pulmonary
nodules. After being extracted and fixed, the sections
of lungs were stained by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl

DAPI staining
For DAPI staining, TE1 and KYSE150 cells
(1 × 105) were plated on a 3.5-cm dish. After 24 h, cells
were treated with 20 μM GPX for different times (24 h
and 48 h). Then, they were fixed in 4% formaldehyde,
permeabilized in 0.3% Triton X-100 and stained in DAPI.
The cell apoptosis was observed and imaged under an
IX83 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).

Statistical analysis
All of the results were repeated at least three times,
and data were analyzed by SPSS 18.0 software and
described as the means ± S.D. Statistically significant
differences between two independent groups were
determined by two-tailed Student’s t-test, and 3 or more
group comparisons were evaluated by one-way ANOVA.
A value of P < 0.05 was defined as significant.
