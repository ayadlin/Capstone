Abstract
Use of tamoxifen is associated with a 50% reduction in breast
cancer incidence and an increase in endometrial cancer
incidence. Here, we documented tamoxifen-induced gene
expression changes in cultured normal human mammary
epithelial cells (strains 5, 16, and 40), established from tissue
taken at reduction mammoplasty from three individuals. Cells
exposed to 0, 10, or 50 Mmol/L of tamoxifen for 48 hours were
evaluated for (E)-A-(deoxyguanosine-N 2-yl)-tamoxifen (dGN 2-TAM) adduct formation using TAM-DNA (DNA modified
with dG-N 2-TAM) chemiluminescence immunoassay, gene
expression changes using National Cancer Institute DNAoligonucleotide microarray, and real-time PCR. At 48 hours,
cells exposed to 10 and 50 Mmol/L of tamoxifen were 85.6%
and 48.4% viable, respectively, and there were no measurable
dG-N 2-TAM adducts. For microarrays, cells were exposed to 10
Mmol/L of tamoxifen and genes with expression changes of
>3-fold were as follows: 13 genes up-regulated and 1 downregulated for strain 16; 17 genes up-regulated for strain 5, and
11 genes up-regulated for strain 40. Interferon-inducible genes
(IFITM1, IFIT1, MXI, and GIP3), and a potassium ion channel
(KCNJ1) were up-regulated in all three strains. No significant
expression changes were found for genes related to estrogen
or xenobiotic metabolism. Real-time PCR revealed the upregulation of IFNA1 and confirmed the tamoxifen-induced upregulation of the five other genes identified by microarray,
with the exception of GIP3 and MX1, which were not upregulated in strain 40. Induction of IFN-related genes in the
three normal human mammary epithelial cell strains suggests
that, in addition to hormonal effects, tamoxifen exposure may
enhance immune response in normal breast tissue. [Cancer Res

Introduction
In addition to surgery and radiation therapy, estrogen receptor
(ER)–positive breast cancer is frequently treated with adjuvant
therapy that may include tamoxifen (Nolvadex), a tamoxifen
analogue or an aromatase inhibitor (1–4). Tamoxifen therapy
reduces the incidence of contralateral breast cancer in breast
cancer survivors by 47% (5), and new breast cancers in women at
high-risk (prophylactic use) by 38% (6). However, increases in

endometrial (6, 7) and rare uterine cancers (8) in women receiving
tamoxifen therapy raises concern for women receiving tamoxifen
for long periods of time. This concern is enhanced by reports of a
strong hepatocarcinogenic response in tamoxifen-exposed rats,
in which both hepatic DNA formation of dG-N 2-TAM (TAM-DNA)
adduct (9, 10) and liver tumor incidence (11) correlated with dose,
suggesting that classical genotoxicity may be the predominant
mechanism for liver tumor formation in this model (10, 12, 13). In
women, the mechanism underlying tamoxifen-induced endometrial tumor formation is a topic of some controversy, with some
studies indicating a genotoxic mechanism and others implying
hormonally controlled events (14–21). An ongoing populationbased case-control study (22) may solve this controversy, but the
final report has not been published. The investigators compared
endometrial cancer incidence in breast cancer survivors receiving
tamoxifen and toremifene. Toremifene has been shown to be
nongenotoxic in experimental models (23). However, a report
documenting similar frequencies of K-ras codon 12 mutations in
endometrium from women receiving either tamoxifen or toremifene suggests that similar genotoxic events may occur with both
treatments (21).
We considered that tamoxifen-induced changes in DNA damage
and gene expression may elucidate pathways relevant for molecular
mechanisms of drug activity. The current study has focused on
normal breast using strains of normal human mammary epithelial
cells (NHMEC) derived from human breast tissue taken at
reduction mammoplasty from healthy women. In this study, the
three different strains, derived from three different individuals,
reflect human interindividual variability and similarity with regard
to tamoxifen-induced gene expression. Cells were exposed for 48
hours to a tamoxifen concentration similar to that found in human
plasma, and there were no measurable TAM-DNA adducts in any
NHMEC strain. However, significant changes in gene expression,
particularly for immune-response genes, were observed first by
microarray and subsequently confirmed by real-time (RT) PCR for
the genes of interest. This study provides evidence of a
nonhormonal mechanism for tamoxifen activity in human breast.

Corp.) and RT-PCR was performed using the SYBR Premix Ex Taq, Perfect
Real-time kit (Takara Bio, Inc.).
NHMEC culture, ER status, tamoxifen exposure, and cell survival.
Three primary NHMEC strains, M98040 (strain 40), M98016 (strain 16), and
M99005 (strain 5) which were described previously (24), were grown in
serum-free MEGM (Clonetics). These strains were characterized for ER by
immunohistochemical staining. Briefly, cells that were grown in microscope
chamber slides were washed in PBS [KH2PO4 (1.06 mmol/L), Na2HPO4
(5.6 mmol/L), NaCl (154 mmol/L); pH 7.4] and then fixed with ethanol
(5 min, 20jC). Fixed cells were thawed at 37jC (0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS)
and permeabilized in Triton X-100 (ambient temperature, 30 min). The
Triton X-100 was then washed out with PBS and the cells were incubated
with a primary anti-ER rabbit IgG (4 Ag/mL at 4jC for 16 h; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). The primary antibody was removed by washing thrice with
PBS and the cells were incubated in goat serum (37jC for 20 min) before
washing again in PBS. The cells were incubated with fluorescein-conjugated
goat anti-rabbit (diluted 400-fold; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 37jC for 45
min in the dark, then washed thrice with PBS and mounted (M1289, Sigma)
for fluorescence microscopy. None of the three strains expressed ERh, but
the strain 16 and strain 40 cells were positive for ERa.
Cells (at passage 7–13) were plated at a density of 1  106 cells/15 cm
plate or T-175 flask for DNA preparation, and at a density of 1  106 cells/
six-well plate for RNA preparation and for measuring cell survival. Plated
cells were grown for 48 h prior to treatment with either 10 or 50 Amol/L of
tamoxifen, or vehicle (DMSO) for an additional 48 h. After 48 h, cells were
trypsinized and counted using a Coulter Particle Counter (Model Z1,
Coulter Electronics).
For TAM-DNA adduct quantitation, three dishes or flasks of cells were
exposed under the same conditions on three separate occasions. For
isolation of DNA, the cells were washed twice in PBS and lysed in cell lysis
buffer (50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 0.1 mol/L EDTA, 0.1 mol/L NaCl, 1.0% SDS),
and incubated first with RNase A for 1 h at 37jC and then with proteinase K
for 1 h at 70jC. The lysate was then extracted once with phenol/
chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, and DNA was precipitated with 1.0 mL of
ethanol and subsequently resuspended in water. For some studies, DNA was
isolated by nonorganic extraction (DNA Extraction Kit, Serologicals
Corporation). DNA was quantified by UV spectrophotometry at A260.
For microarray analyses, three replicate exposures were performed for
the preliminary study and then confirmed by an independent exposure in
duplicate for each cell strain. For isolation of RNA, the cells were lysed with
1.0 mL of TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and RNA was
extracted according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Residual DNA was
removed by digestion with DNase I, and the total RNA quantity and purity
were assessed by spectrophotometry and gel electrophoresis, respectively.
For RT-PCR experiments, NHMEC strains were subcultured to passage 6
from frozen stocks and exposed to 10 Amol/L of tamoxifen for 48 h on two
separate occasions. cDNA was prepared from RNA, and each cDNA sample
was assayed six times by RT-PCR for IFIT1, IFITM1, MX1, GIP3, and KCNJ1.
IFNA1 was assayed thrice.
TAM-DNA CIA. Rabbit antiserum, elicited against DNA containing 2.4%
modification with (E)-a-(deoxyguanosine-N 2-yl)-tamoxifen (dG-N 2-TAM)
was used in the TAM-DNA CIA as previously described (25), with additional

specific details below. For the TAM-DNA standard curve, we used DNA
modified to 4.8 dG-N 2-TAM adducts/106 nucleotides, and serial dilutions
were carried out to give 6.630 to 0.009 fmol dG-N 2-TAM per well.
Competition was achieved by mixing anti–TAM-DNA antiserum with either
TAM-DNA standard plus carrier or biological sample DNA in PBS, so that
each well contained 5 Ag of total DNA. Anti–TAM-DNA was used at a final
dilution of 1:1,000,000 in I-Block solution (Applied Biosystems). The final
light emission was measured at 542 nm using a TR717 Microplate
Luminometer (PE Applied Biosystems). For the TAM-DNA standard curve,
50% inhibition was at 0.89 F 0.12 fmol dG-N 2-TAM (mean F SE, n = 5).
Because up to 20 Ag of DNA could be analyzed, the limit of detection was
calculated to be f0.3 dG-N 2-TAM adducts/108 nucleotides.
Microarray analysis of gene expression. cDNA, generated from 20 Ag
of RNA by Fairplay Kit (Stratagene), was labeled with Cy3 (unexposed
control) and Cy5 (tamoxifen-exposed) by indirect coupling, denatured and
hybridized to Hs-Operon v2-vB1 oligoarrays containing <20,000 immobilized human gene elements (Microarray Facility, Advanced Technology
Center, National Cancer Institute). After overnight hybridization at 42jC,
microarrays were scanned on a GenePix4000A scanner and analyzed by the
NCI MicroArray Database system. Genes with z3-fold color intensity
change in >66% of the arrays were considered of interest and subjected to
further analysis. For each RNA sample, array data was confirmed once using
reciprocal CY3-CY5 labeling. Microarray data has been entered into the
GEO system and the MIAME accession number is GSE13476.
RT-PCR. RNA (1.0 Ag) was used for cDNA synthesis by the iScript cDNA
synthesis kit (Bio-Rad Corp.). All RT-PCR reactions were performed using
the MyIQ single color real-time detection system (Bio-Rad Corp.), and RTPCR was performed using the SYBR Premix Ex Taq, Perfect real-time kit
(Takara Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. The primers used
for RT-PCR amplification for gene expression quantification are listed in
Table 1 and were purchased from Invitrogen Life Technologies.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis of the microarray data was
performed using the NCI MicroArray Database system, with 66%
concordance among assays considered significant. RT-PCR data, for the
comparison between untreated and tamoxifen-treated cells, was evaluated
using Student’s t test.

Results
ER status, cell survival, and TAM-DNA adduct formation.
The NHMEC strains used in these studies were designated 40, 16,
and 5, and were characterized for ER status. None contained ERh,
but the strain 16 and strain 40 cells were positive for ERa.
Unexposed NHMEC strain 40 cells underwent 1.4 population
doublings in 48 hours, and by comparison, cells exposed to 10 and
50 Amol/L of tamoxifen had 1.2 and 0.67 population doublings,
respectively. These corresponded to 85.6% and 48.4% survival,
respectively. Because the toxicity observed with the higher dose
was judged unacceptable, the subsequent microarray and RT-PCR
studies used 10 Amol/L of tamoxifen.
DNA extracted from the three NHMEC strains, exposed to 0, 10,
and 50 Amol/L of tamoxifen for 48 h, was subjected to TAM-DNA

CIA and showed no evidence of measurable dG-N 2-TAM adducts.
Using up to 20 Ag of DNA/well, the limit of detection was 0.3 dGN 2-TAM adducts/108 nucleotides.
Microarray studies in NHMEC strains exposed to 10 Mmol/L
of tamoxifen for 48 hours. Microarray analyses, performed using
the NCI microarray system, used RNA/cDNA samples obtained
from three independent exposures for each cell strain. Each RNA/
cDNA sample was assayed on 7 to 12 microarrays, at least one of
which involved reciprocal labeling for microarray confirmation.
The data primarily showed up-regulation of genes in tamoxifenexposed cells compared with unexposed cells. We chose to evaluate
only genes that were up-regulated or down-regulated by z3-fold,
and a list of those genes is shown in Table 2. One notable
conclusion that can be drawn from Table 2 is that many of the
genes that are the most highly up-regulated by tamoxifen seem to
be immune response–related genes, associated either with IFN
regulation, inflammation, histocompatibility or additional
responses to external insult and stress. The specific microarray
data for cells altered by z3-fold are shown in Tables 3, 4, and 5, for
strains 16, 5, and 40, respectively. All of the genes altered
significantly were up-regulated, with the exception of SLC7A5,
which was down-regulated. The cell strains can be ranked for
magnitude of up-regulation in the following order: strain 16 >
strain 5 > strain 40. Genes which were up-regulated by microarray
in all three cell strains included IFIT1, IFITM1, MX1, GIP3, and
KCNJ1.
RT-PCR of genes up-regulated in all three NHMEC strains by
exposure to 10 Mmol/L of tamoxifen for 48 hours. Because the

microarray is essentially a screening procedure, it was important to
confirm the microarray results with RT-PCR. Primers were
designed and RT-PCR was performed for the five genes upregulated in all three NHMEC strains: IFIT1, IFITM1, MX1, GIP3 and
KCNJ1. IFNa (IFNA1) was not present on the NCI microarrays used
here, but the primers were developed and the expression of this
gene was also assayed by RT-PCR. The results are presented in
Tables 3, 4, and 5 (last column).
For the six genes examined by RT-PCR, there was up-regulation
that generally compared well with the microarray data. Similar to
the results of the microarray analysis, strain 16 had the greatest
increase in gene expression, followed by strain 5, and strain 40. In
addition, in all three NHMEC strains, the levels of up-regulation
observed with IFITM1, IFIT1, and KCNJ1 were greater than those
observed with MX1 and GIP3 (Tables 3, 4, and 5). When examined
by RT-PCR, NHMEC strain 40 showed no up-regulation for MX1
and GIP3 (Table 5). In NHMEC strains 16, 40, and 5, the upregulation observed for IFNA1 was 7-fold, 5-fold, and 13-fold,
respectively, very much in the same range as the up-regulation of
the IFN-inducible genes IFIT1 and IFITM1.

Discussion
In this study, we exposed NHMEC strains to 10 and 50 Amol/L of
tamoxifen for 48 hours to investigate TAM-DNA adduct formation
and tamoxifen-induced alterations in gene expression. TAM-DNA
adduct formation was not measurable by TAM-DNA immunoassay,
but changes in gene expression determined by microarray and

confirmed by RT-PCR showed the up-regulation of a series of
immune response/IFN pathway genes in each of the three normal
mammary epithelial cell strains.
We used NHMEC strains designated 5, 16, and 40 that were
derived from tissue taken at reduction mammoplasty from three
different individuals. Strains 16 and 40 were positive for ERa, and
all three strains were negative for ERh. By microarray, we found
that, after 48 hours of exposure to a plasma-equivalent tamoxifen
dose, 1 gene was down-regulated z3-fold, and 19 genes were upregulated z3-fold. Most of the up-regulated genes were immuneresponse–related genes, and there were no alterations in xenobiotic

metabolism or hormone-responsive genes. The most common
changes were found in histocompatibility genes and intermediates
in the JAK/STAT-IFN signal transduction pathway (26, 27), and
because all three cell strains showed remarkably similar patterns of
gene up-regulation, it seems that these gene expression changes
may constitute a relatively common early stress response to
tamoxifen exposure in NHMECs.
The importance of these immune-related pathways was also
shown in a murine, human mammary carcinoma xenograft model
by Becker and colleagues (28). The authors cultured human
tamoxifen-sensitive MaCa 3366 breast ductal carcinoma cells for

exposure using the Affymetrix microarray. These authors showed
up-regulation of 9 IFN-related genes in tamoxifen-resistant human
MaCa 3366 cells exposed to tamoxifen; these included, BST2, IFITM2,
GIP2, GIP3, IFITM1, LGALS3BP, IFIT1, MX1, and IFI27. Becker and
colleagues (28) also reported differential expression of some
estrogen-responsive genes, which was not reproduced in this study.
Several studies using cultured cells have reported tamoxifeninduced alterations in gene expression for the IFN-regulated JAK/
STAT pathway. Itoh and colleagues (29) used ER-positive MCF-7
cells that were transfected with the aromatase gene and exposed
for 7 days to tamoxifen in the presence of androgen. They reported
modest increases in expression for some of the same STAT1
pathway genes seen in our study, including GIP2, IFI27, and IFIT1.
Perou and colleagues (30) found up-regulation of genes in this
pathway, including STAT1, OAS1, and IFI17, and postulated that
STAT1 up-regulation was present at all stages of cell growth.
Similarly, we found up-regulation of STAT1, OAS1, OAS3, and IFI27.
In a subsequent study, Perou and colleagues (31) reported
substantial variation among primary human breast tumors for
genes related to the STAT1 signal transduction pathway, suggesting
that expression of IFN and related events may comprise an
important pathway in normal breast tissue with and without
tamoxifen, as well as in breast tumors.
Several studies investigating gene expression patterns in MCF-7
breast cancer cells, with or without tamoxifen exposure, did not
report alterations in genes related to the JAK/STAT signal
transduction pathway. Using MCF-7 cells exposed to tamoxifen,
Gadal and colleagues (32) showed altered expression of genes
associated with cytoskeletal modeling, DNA repair, active ER
formation, growth factor synthesis and mitogenic pathways.
Frasor and colleagues (33) found up-regulation of 50 genes in
tamoxifen-exposed ER-positive MCF-7 cells, and Hodges and
colleagues (34) found expression changes in cell cycle–related
genes in ER-positive MCF-7 cells exposed to 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen.
It is apparent that different studies queried different numbers of

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (3). February 1, 2009

genetic elements, and it is not clear if our genes of interest were
always examined.
It is likely that gene expression data obtained from a cancer
cell line, such as MCF-7 cells, or from human breast cancer tissue
(35, 36), will have different expression patterns than normal human
breast tissue or cultured breast epithelial cells. In performing these
experiments with NHMECs, we attempted to model events
occurring in normal breast tissue in order to focus on tamoxifeninduced alterations in gene expression. One conclusion that can be
drawn from these studies is that, whereas ER status is not the same
in all three of these NHMEC strains, the tamoxifen-induced gene
expression patterns were so similar, in cells that were ERa-positive
and ERa-negative, that these particular changes seemed to be
independent of ER status.
In addition to the classic immune response mediation, IFNs have
long been known to have static and chemotherapeutic effects on
tumor cells (26, 37). IFNs, given in conjunction with tamoxifen,
enhanced growth inhibition in various human tumor cell lines,
including estrogen-dependent and estrogen-independent MCF-7
breast cancer xenografts (38, 39), and six additional hormonedependent and hormone-resistant breast cancer cell lines (40).
Underlying mechanisms seem to include the induction of apoptosis
(41, 42), with participation of the IFN regulatory factor-1 and/or
thioredoxin reductase. The induction of IFN-associated genes in
NHMECs exposed to tamoxifen in this study suggests that, in
addition to the known hormonal mechanisms, tamoxifen may act
to inhibit the appearance of nascent breast tumors by inducing
some IFN-related genes and possibly enhancing apoptosis.
Alternatively, the products of IFN-related gene expression in
normal tissue may have an inhibitory effect on the growth of
neighboring nascent tumor cells. Current literature supports the
contention that tamoxifen induces the expression of JAK/STAT
pathway intermediates, and available studies suggest that there
may be important nonhormonal mechanisms of tamoxifen activity
in normal breast tissue.
