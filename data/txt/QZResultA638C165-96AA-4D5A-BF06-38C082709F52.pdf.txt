ABSTRACT
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is usually managed by the transcatheter arterial
chemoembolization (TACE). However, this technique has been challenged since
severe complications have been observed in clinical practices. As a result, clinicians
have started to seek other minimally invasive surgeries with equivalent efficacy. The
corresponding surgeries were assessed by the five outcomes: complete response (CR),
partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), progression disease (PD) and objective
response rate (ORR). Direct meta-analysis and network meta-analysis were performed
and the results were represented by odds ratios (OR), 95% confidence and credential
intervals. Furthermore, the value of surface under the cumulative ranking curve
(SUCRA)was calculated to provide corresponding rankings.Seventeen studies were
incorporated into the network meta-analysis which indicated that TACE + externalbeam radiation therapy (EBRT) and drug-eluting beads (DEB) were better than TACE
at controllingPD. TACE + EBRT demonstrated their advantages compared to TARE90Y.However, network meta-analysis comparison showed no significant difference
between the corresponding eight treatments with respect to CR, PR, SD and ORR.
Moreover, the SUCRA suggested that TACE+EBRT were better than other treatments at
treating unresectableHCC.Based on the present results of this network meta-analysis,
TACE + EBRT was more effective than the other seven minimally invasive surgeries
and therefore it is considered as the optimal treatment for HCC.

INTRODUCTION

conventional treatments such as local ablation therapy,
surgical resection and liver transplantation are not feasible
[3].
A previous study suggested that transcatheter
arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the first choice
to treat the intermediate-stage HCC [4]. The proportion
of HCC patients who achieved partial remission after
TACE is approximately 62% and both tumor progression
and vascular invasion were delayed significantly [5]. As
suggested by various randomized controlled trials, TACE

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)is one of the most
lethal cancers all around the world. New medications
and treatments are being developed to tackle the high
morbidity and mortality of HCC [1].Currently, resection
has been the first choice for managing HCC at early stages
[2]. However, early symptoms of HCC are difficult to
be identified due to the specificity of HCC. As a result,
HCC is usually diagnosed at advanced stages in which

improved the average survival time by approximately two
years compared to symptomatic treatments and systemic
chemotherapies [6].Common techniques including
sorafenib (SOR), percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI),
high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), drug-eluting
beads (DEB) and external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT)
can be combined with other therapies. Furthermore,
studies have provided evidence that introducing HIFU
into TACE improved the overall survival rate compared to
TACE alone [7] and the cumulative survival rate of HCC
patients treated by PEI in conjunction with TACE was
12.7% higher than those treated with TACEalone [8].Some
studies also suggested that introducing DEB into TACE
enhanced the effectiveness of TACE and such an enhanced
effectiveness is reflected by an improved survival rate as
well as theinhibition of tumor progression [9].Although
there was no significant difference in the total survival
rate between the ethanol ablation (TEA) and TACE, it
is acknowledged that TEA has more durable effects on
HCC patients than TACE [10]. Recently, the yttrium-90
radio embolization (TARE-90Y)has started to replace
TACEwith respect to local HCC [4].
The elegant approach of network meta-analysis
enabled us to compare the efficacy of different minimally

invasive surgeries by synthesizing both direct and
indirect evidence obtained from randomized trials. Apart
from that, the network meta-analysis provided us with a
comprehensive ranking with respect to different endpoints
and such a ranking may be used to distinguishing one
treatment from another [11].

RESULTS
Baseline characteristics of the included studies
Initially, 1,576potentially relevant studies were
identifiedfrom databases by using the predefined
protocol. A total of 493studieswere excluded for duplicate
publicationsor reviews, leaving 1,083 studies which
passed the title and abstract review. We further excluded
671 studies since they either were not relevant to our
research areas or were not qualified for the exclusion
criteria. Another 395 studies were excluded as the full-text
or the corresponding data were not available. Finally,17
studies were incorporated into the network meta-analysis
(Figure 1) [8-10, 12-25]. Among a total of 2,669 patients

were published between 1995 and 2014, all of which
are two-arm trials. The baseline characteristics of the
incorporated studiesweresummarized in Table 1.

contrast, DEB-TACE (OR = 2.21, 95%CI = 0.98-4.96),
TACE+EBRT (OR = 8.71, 95%CI = 0 .89-85.58) and TEA
(OR = 1.88, 95%CI = 0.81-4.36) appeared to have similar
effects with TACE on patients (Figure 2). Moreover,
TACE+EBRT (OR = 5.49, 95%CI = 2.78-10.84) were
more likely to induce PR compared to TACE (Figure 3).
Besides that, TACE+SOR(OR = 1.81, 95%CI = 1.08-3.03)
appeared to have stronger effects than SOR with respect to
stabilizing the condition of patients (Figure 4).
When compared with TACE, ACE+SOR (OR =
0.67, 95%CI = 0.40-1.13), TACE+HIFU (OR = 0.45,
95%CI = 0.14-1.44), TACE+PEI (OR = 0.81, 95%CI =
0.27-2.40) and TARE-90Y (OR = 0.93, 95%CI = 0.342.54) showed no significant difference in the probability
of PD, while patients treated with DEB-TACE (OR = 0.44,
95%CI = 0.29-0.68) or TACE+EBRT (OR = 0.03, 95%CI
= 0.01-0.49) were less likely to experiencePD (Figure 5).
Treatments including TACE+HIFU (OR = 3.33, 95%CI
= 1.37-8.09), DEB-TACE (OR = 2.60, 95%CI = 1.046.49)and TACE+EBRT (OR = 7.06, 95%CI = 3.46-14.42)
exhibited enhanced effectiveness compared to TACE with
respect to ORR(Figure 6).

Direct meta-analysis
The effectiveness of the eight treatments was
compared in direct meta-analysis. As compared to
TACE, TACE+HIFU(OR = 3.84, 95%CI = 1.13-13.05),
TACE+PEI(OR = 5.11, 95%CI = 1.38-18.85) and TARE90Y(OR = 4.49, 95%CI = 1.33-15.09)were more likely to
achieve aCR among patients with unresectableHCC. By

progression control whereas single TACE may not provide
such effectiveness.

As suggested by the network meta-analysis, both
TACE+EBRT and DEB-TACE(OR = 0.04, 95%Crl =
0.01-0.52; OR = 0.33, 95%Crl = 0.09-0.94)are more
effective than TACE with respect to the inhibition of
PD. Apart from that, TACE+EBRT exhibited further
superiority over TARE-90Y(OR = 0.04, 95%Crl =
0.00-0.82; Table 5). However, network meta-analysis
comparison indicated no significant difference in CR, PR,
SD and ORR amongtreatments (Tables 2-4,6).
Another interesting trend is that DEB-TACE
and TACE+EBRTshow a higher PD ratethan TACE.
Therefore, we suspected that TACE+EBRT may provide
HCC patients with favorable results with respect to disease

Cumulative ranking
Table 7 shows the relative ranking of eight
minimally invasive treatments which are widely applied in
clinical practices for unresectable HCC. As suggested by
the corresponding SUCRA values, TACE+EBRT appeared
to have the highest ranking in CR (76.50%), PR (88.50%),
PD (95.33%) and ORR (81.13%). TACE+SOR exhibited
the highest ranking probability (79.14%) with respect
to SD. All of this evidence enabled us to conclude that
TACE+EBRTmay be the most appropriate treatment for
managing patients with unresectable HCC.

DISCUSSION

One major issue of TACE was contributed by
the over-expression of VEGF and HIF-1α which result
in tumor progression, invasion and metastasis [29,
30, 40].SOR is a multikinase inhibitor which is able to
suppress tumor cell proliferation by targeting theVEGF
receptor and/or the PDGF receptor [41, 42]. Our study
supported the notion that introducing SOR into TACE
could significantly enhance the effectiveness of TACE
which was reflected by the improved PR and SD. This
trend may be explained by the fact that SOR is likely to
suppress the expression of VEGF and hence reduce the
side effects resultedfrom TACE. Additionally, DEB-TACE
also exhibited promisingresults in the SUCRA ranking.
DEB-TACE is able to alleviate the local embolization
resulted from HCC lesions and prolong the release of
chemotherapeutic agents into adjacent tissues [43, 44].
Furthermore, DEB-TACE is able to alleviate the symptoms
of HCC by releasing some antitumor lesion factors so
that the side effects of TACE can be prevented [45-47].
As suggested by the corresponding ranking of SUCRA,
TARE-90Y, TACE+HIFU and TACE+PEI all displayed
desirable results compared to TACE alone in most of the
aspects. It is known that 90Y is a pure β emitter which
stimulates the physical half-life of zirconium-90 to
approximately 64.1 hours and such a stimulation enables
it to have some excellent properties being an effective
transarterial liver-directed agent [48]. More importantly,
TARE-90Y is able to release radioactive particles into the
liver artery without significant arterial occlusion [49] and
HIFU perhaps is able to induce the complete coagulative
necrosis of tumor without affecting adjacent tissues and
structures [50].On the other hand, TACE+PEI have been
considered as an appropriate option for small HCC lesions
provided that the diameter of tumorshould be less than
3 cm and such a criterion has reduced the popularity of
TACE+PEI in clinical practices [51].
Nevertheless, some limitations may have uncertain
impact on theoverall conclusions. For instance, four
surgeries (TACE+HIFU, TACE+PEI, TACE+EBRT,

As one of the most common malignant tumors, the
mortality ofHCC is extremely high and we have witnessed
a large number of families struggling with this disease [26,
27]. In this study, we collected data from 17 studies with
respect to eight minimally invasive surgical approaches
in order to assess their short-term efficacy and safety. Our
research objective is to rank the corresponding surgical
approaches by using theelegant approach of network metaanalysis. It appears that TACE+EBRT was more effective
than the other seven surgical approaches. Moreover,
TACE+SOR, DEB-TACE,TACE+HIFU, TACE+PEI and
TARE-90Y exhibited stronger performance than expected.
TACE has been recommended for patients who are
not suitable for surgeries [28]. However, arterial occlusion
in tumor tissues may trigger hypoxia and hence contribute
to the over-expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [29,
30].While the over-expression of HIF-1α could cause
tumor progression, invasion and metastasis [31, 32],
VEGF inhibits the apoptosis of vessel endothelial cells
and promotes proliferation [33, 34] and it triggers tumor
progression by stimulating the formation of blood vessels
[35]. Although our study demonstrated the short-term
effects of these surgical approaches, whether these effects
remain strong in the long term should be further verified
[36, 37]. As suggested by previous studies, introducing
EBRT into TACE was able to enhance the effectiveness of
TACE alone and hence improve the overall survival status
of HCC patients [23, 38, 39]. Besides that, both direct and
indirect evidence from the network meta-analysis reached
a conclusion that TACE+EBRT were more effective
than TACE alone with respect to CR, PR and ORR. By
contrast, TACE had better performance than TACE+EBRT
with respect to SD and PD.On top of that, TACE+EBRT
exhibited compelling results in PR, PD, CR, ORR and
DCR in comparison to the other seven minimally invasive
surgeries.

TEA) contained only one eligible trial and thus the
assessment of these approaches may not be as accurate as
those approaches in which a large number of trials were
included. Inherent difference in studies and trials such as
study design, assessment approach and surgical procedures
may also have influenceon the overall results. Finally, we
intentionally removed some studiesin which side effects
were not mentioned and such missing studies may contain

key information with respect to the efficacy and safety of
these surgeries.
For summary, TACE+EBRT exhibited the
most compelling results in comparison to the other
seven minimally invasive surgeries. Futures studies
should investigate the long-term effects of these
minimally invasive surgeries on HCC patients by
designingappropriate following-up studies. This study may

(CI). Inter-study heterogeneity was identified using the Q
test and I2 test. If there was no significant heterogeneity
among studies, a fixed-effects model was selected for
analysis; otherwise a random-effects model was selected
for analysis [52]. Next, network meta-analysis was
performed by using the GEMTC (V0.6) package and the
corresponding results were combined with those obtained
from the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model
and Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC). We used R
software (V3.2.1) in order to produce the surface under
the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) and calculated
the ranking of different interventions [53]. For each
intervention, efficacy and safety outcomes were ranked by
the SUCRA: a higher value of SUCRA indicated a higher
ranking. All the calculations were conducted by using R
software (V3.2.1), GEMTC package (V0.6) and Open
BUGS (V3.4.0).

In the meta-analysis, studies that met the following
criteria were included: (i) randomized controlled trials; (ii)
one or more of the following interventions were involved
in the trials: TACE, TACE+SOR, SOR, TACE+HIFU,
TACE+PEI, DEB-TACE, TARE-90Y, TACE+EBRT and
TEA; (iii) patients involved were over 18yearsold with
unresectableHCC; (iv) no operative interventions had been
conducted before the trials were conducted; (v) one or
more of the following outcomes were assessed: complete
response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD),
progression disease (PD) and objective response rate
(ORR).
However, studies were excluded if any of the
following conditions were satisfied: (i) patients involved
failed to perform normal activities or did not have normal
functioning kidneys, lungs or heart; (ii) treatments
for unresactableHCC, such as surgery, medication,
radiotherapy and others, had been given; (iii) unqualified
literatures which did not have academic integrity (e.g.
incorrectly matched case-control studies).
