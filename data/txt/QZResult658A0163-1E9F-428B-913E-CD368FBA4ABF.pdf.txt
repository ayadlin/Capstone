Abstract
Mitochondrial products such as ATP, reactive oxygen species, and aspartate are key regulators of
cellular metabolism and growth. Abnormal mitochondrial function compromises integrated
growth-related processes such as development and tissue repair1,2, as well as homeostatic
mechanisms that counteract ageing and neurodegeneration3, cardiovascular disease4,5, and
cancer6,7. Physiologic mechanisms that control mitochondrial activity in such settings remain
incompletely understood. Here we show that the atypical Fat1 cadherin acts as a molecular ‘brake’
on mitochondrial respiration that regulates vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation after

arterial injury. Fragments of Fat1 accumulate in SMC mitochondria, and the Fat1 intracellular
domain interacts with multiple mitochondrial proteins, including critical factors associated with
the inner mitochondrial membrane. SMCs lacking Fat1 (Fat1KO) grow faster, consume more
oxygen for ATP production, and contain more aspartate. Notably, expression in Fat1KO cells of a
modified Fat1 intracellular domain that localizes exclusively to mitochondria largely normalizes
oxygen consumption, and the growth advantage of these cells can be suppressed by inhibition of
mitochondrial respiration, which suggest that a Fat1-mediated growth control mechanism is
intrinsic to mitochondria. Consistent with this idea, Fat1 species associate with multiple
respiratory complexes, and Fat1 deletion both increases the activity of complexes I and II and
promotes the formation of complex-I-containing supercomplexes. In vivo, Fat1 is expressed in
injured human and mouse arteries, and inactivation of SMC Fat1 in mice potentiates the response
to vascular damage, with markedly increased medial hyperplasia and neointimal growth, and
evidence of higher SMC mitochondrial respiration. These studies suggest that Fat1 controls
mitochondrial activity to restrain cell growth during the reparative, proliferative state induced by
vascular injury. Given recent reports linking Fat1 to cancer, abnormal kidney and muscle
development, and neuropsychiatric disease8–13, this Fat1 function may have importance in other
settings of altered cell growth and metabolism.

Proliferation of SMCs is essential for repair of injured arteries, but in excess can cause
vascular obstruction leading to tissue ischaemia and/or infarction14. SMC expression of the
atypical cadherin Fat1 is induced by both growth factor exposure and vascular injury;
however, knockdown of Fat1 enhances SMC proliferation, and the Fat1 intracellular domain
(Fat1 ICD), expressed as a chimaeric protein fused to the interleukin 2 receptor α-chain
(denoted hereafter as Fat1–IL-2R), is sufficient to inhibit growth15. In addition, recent
reports link FAT1 silencing and/or mutation to a spectrum of cancers8,9. To understand how
Fat1 controls proliferation, we used tandem affinity purification (TAP) followed by peptide
mass fingerprinting using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass
spectrometry (TAP–MS) to identify proteins that interact with the Fat1 ICD. We noted that a
surprisingly large fraction of candidate interactors associated with mitochondria, including
several proteins that localize to the inner mitochondrial membrane (Fig. 1a, Extended Data
Table 1); these observations were replicated in an unbiased independent bioinformatic
analysis of the TAP–MS dataset (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 1a).

We used a conditionally targeted mouse Fat1 allele (Fat1loxP)11 and Cre-mediated
recombination to inactivate Fat1 expression in SMCs (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Cellular
fractionation showed Fat1 fragments in the mitochondrial sample: immunoblotting using a
Fat1 C-terminus-directed antiserum15 identified multiple specific signals between ~60–100
kDa, including an ~60 kDa band seen only in whole-cell and mitochondrial fractions (Fig.
1c). Confocal imaging of these cells showed Fat1 and mitochondrial co-localization (Fig.
1d). Identification of multiple inner mitochondrial membrane proteins in our screen (Fig. 1a,
Extended Data Fig. 1a, Extended Data Table 1) suggests that Fat1 may associate with
respiratory complexes; indeed, traditional co-immunoprecipitation studies confirmed
interaction of the Fat1 ICD with NDUFS3, a complex-I-specific subunit (Fig. 1e), and with
prohibitin, an important regulator of complex I stability and function16 (Extended Data Fig.
1c).

We then assessed growth and mitochondrial function. Resazurin (AlamarBlue) growth/
viability assays were validated across a range of input cell numbers, and performed similarly
for both wild-type and Fat1KO cells (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Evidence of higher
proliferation in SMCs lacking Fat1 (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 2b) was normalized by
restoring Fat1 expression with Fat1–IL-2R (Extended Data Fig. 2b). In assays of
mitochondrial respiration using extracellular flux (Seahorse) analysis, Fat1KO SMCs
exhibited higher baseline and maximal oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) compared to wild
type (Fig. 2b, Extended Data Fig. 2c), with equal coupling efficiency (Extended Data Fig.
2d). Coupling efficiency reflects how effectively respiratory activity is translated into ATP
production17, so higher ATP-linked oxygen consumption in Fat1KO SMCs indicates that
these cells generate more ATP. Net ATP levels in wild-type and Fat1KO SMCs were similar
(Extended Data Fig. 2e), which in turn suggests that consumption of ATP in Fat1KO SMCs is
also increased. Reactive oxygen species, which also result from mitochondrial respiration,
were present at similar levels under standard conditions, but were higher in Fat1KO cells
after exposure to H2O2 (Extended Data Fig. 2f), suggesting a partially depleted capacity to
buffer or inactivate reactive oxygen species when Fat1 is absent. Aspartate, a metabolite
essential for macromolecular synthesis and cell proliferation, and a third key product of
respiration18,19, was present at higher levels in Fat1KO SMCs (Fig. 2c). Mitochondrial
respiration is essential for cell growth18,19, including that of SMCs20, so we tested its role in
the increased growth of Fat1KO cells. Limiting respiration by either pharmacologic or
genetic interference targeting complex I did not compromise wild-type cell growth, but
suppressed the growth advantage of Fat1KO cells (Fig. 2d, Extended Data Fig. 3a–c). These
studies suggest that physiologic Fat1 expression modulates SMC growth by restraining
mitochondrial respiration, and that further limits on respiration in wild-type cells have no
repercussion. By contrast, when Fat1 is absent, the corresponding loss of this restraint
increases SMC growth. Overall, these in vitro studies identify Fat1 as an important
suppressor of SMC growth, and show that potentiation of growth in the absence of Fat1
depends on increased respiration.

Respiration can be affected by changes in mitochondrial structure, mass, and/or dynamics,
but mitochondria from wild-type and Fat1KO SMCs did not exhibit major ultrastructural
differences by electron microscopy (Extended Data Fig. 4a–f). Likewise, we found no
evidence for changes in (1) mitochondrial mass, on the basis of the levels of several
respiratory chain subunits (Extended Data Fig. 4g), (2) mitochondrial biogenesis and
autophagy, on the basis of expression of regulators of these respective processes21 (Extended
Data Fig. 4h–j), or (3) mitochondrial dynamics, as reflected in fusion or fission gene
expression (Extended Data Fig. 4h, k). Failing to identify differences in mitochondrial
structure, mass, or turnover that could explain the increased respiration in Fat1KO SMCs, we
surmised that loss of Fat1 might directly affect respiratory chain activity.
To assess this possibility, we tested if the Fat1 ICD was sufficient to control respiration.
Expression of Fat1–IL-2R—which inhibits SMC growth15—limited respiration in Fat1KO
SMCs (Fig. 3a), and yielded fragments in the mitochondrial fraction similar in size to
endogenous mitochondrial Fat1 species (Extended Data Fig. 5a), but this fusion protein may
also localize to other subcellular compartments. We generated and validated a mitochondriatargeted Fat1 ICD (Fat1mito, Extended Data Fig. 5b–d); Fat1mito repressed both baseline and

maximal OCRs in Fat1KO cells (Fig. 3a, Extended Data Fig. 5e, f), demonstrating that the
Fat1 ICD can suppress respiration through a mechanism intrinsic to mitochondria. Although
expression of the Fat1–IL-2R fusion protein appeared stronger than that of Fat1mito
(Extended Data Fig. 5a, d), the extent of OCR repression achieved was similar, perhaps
indicating that only a subset of the Fat1–IL-2R-derived fragments are active in this capacity.
To localize this effect within the respiratory chain, we assessed the activities of isolated
respiratory complexes. Complexes I and II, but not IV or V, were more active in the absence
of Fat1 (Fig. 3b, c, Extended Data Fig. 6a, b). Moreover, Fat1 ICD species of ~60–100 kDa
were observed in association with immuno-captured complex I, II and V, but not complex IV
(Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig. 6c). To see if Fat1 affects respiratory complex integrity, we
looked at intact mitochondrial complexes by blue native (BN)–PAGE analysis and found that
in Fat1KO SMCs, complex I incorporation into supercomplexes is increased, without a
significant change in the levels of native complex I (Fig. 3e, f, Extended Data Fig. 6d). It has
been proposed that supercomplex conformation facilitates electron transfer without
increasing production of reactive oxygen species22,23; however, the factors regulating
supercomplex assembly are largely unknown. Orthogonal resolution of BN gels under
denaturing conditions indicated a shift of complex I subunits towards supercomplex
conformations in Fat1-deficient SMCs and no major differences in native complex II
(Extended Data Figs 6e, 7). We observed ~60–100-kDa Fat1 species co-migrating with
complex I, II, III, and V, but not complex IV. Notably, a subset of these species also comigrated with a supercomplex containing at least complexes I and III (Extended Data Fig.
6e). These findings suggest that Fat1 limits SMC mitochondrial respiration by repressing
complex I and II activities, and by opposing the incorporation of complex I into
supercomplex structures.

To assess Fat1 relevance to clinical vascular disease, we examined segments of diseased
post-mortem human arteries adjacent to sites of prior stent placement. FAT1 expression
coincided in many areas with ACTA2, a marker of SMCs (Fig. 4a). As it did in mouse
SMCs, FAT1 in cultured human aortic SMCs (HASMCs) co-localized with mitochondria
(Fig. 4b). Moreover, knockdown of FAT1 in HASMCs increased both cell proliferation
(Extended Data Fig. 8a–c) and basal and maximal mitochondrial respiration (Extended Data
Fig. 8d, e). Thus the effects of Fat1 on SMC mitochondrial activity and growth are
conserved across species.

To test SMC Fat1 function in vivo, we crossed Fat1loxP and Tagln-cre mice24 to generate
Fat1loxP/loxPTagln-cre (denoted hereafter as Fat1SMKO, for Fat1 smooth muscle cell
knockout) animals (Extended Data Figs 1b, 9a, b). Baseline arterial structure appeared
normal, with minimal Fat1 expression (Fig. 4c, Extended Data Fig. 9a). After vascular
injury25, Fat1 appeared in the media and neointima of wild-type arteries, co-localizing with
Acta2 and showing a perinuclear distribution consistent with findings in isolated cells (Figs
1d, 4b, Extended Data Fig. 9a, b). Injured arteries from Fat1SMKO mice showed markedly
higher medial SMC hyperplasia and neointimal growth (Fig. 4c–f), increased phosphohistone H3 and cyclin D1 (Fig. 4g), and increased staining for nitrotyrosine, a marker of
increased superoxide stress (Extended Data Fig. 9c). Moreover, SMCs from injured
Fat1SMKO vessels exhibited higher OCRs than those from injured control vessels (Fig. 4h, i,
Extended Data Fig. 9d). Thus, deletion of Fat 1 in SMCs in vivo permits an exaggerated

vascular injury response characterized by SMC hyperproliferation and enhanced
mitochondrial respiration, which supports the idea that Fat1 induction after vascular injury
serves as a physiological regulator of SMC growth, in part by controlling mitochondrial
function.

Author Manuscript

As a large, type-I transmembrane protein, full-length Fat1 appears an unlikely direct
regulator of mitochondrial function. Previous studies describe cell-type-dependent cleavage
of Fat1 that yields multiple smaller species, including Fat1-ICD-bearing derivatives of ~85
and ~65 kDa26. Although the precise structure of the physiologic mitochondrial Fat1 species
that we have identified remains to be determined, in silico analysis of potential Fat1 Cterminal peptides that start at amino acids 4195, 4203, or 4478 yield, on the basis of
MitoProtII27 analysis, respective probabilities of 0.5881, 0.1140, and 0.1548 for export to
mitochondria. Moreover, a mitochondrial function for Drosophila Fat, an atypical cadherin
most closely related to mammalian Fat4 (ref. 28), has recently been reported; a 68 kDa
Drosophila Fat cytoplasmic fragment interacts with and stabilizes complex I28. This last
finding contrasts notably with the increased respiratory activity that we find with Fat1
inactivation, and probably partly reflects the structural divergence between these
cadherins29. Nevertheless, the finding that both Drosophila Fat and mammalian Fat1
participate in mitochondrial regulation is intriguing and perhaps suggests an ancient shared
linkage between primordial cell surface proteins and control of mitochondrial function.
Whether Fat4 is active in mitochondria, and how these distinct members of the Fat family
might cooperate to regulate mitochondrial function, remain to be determined.

Author Manuscript

Although the factors or conditions that trigger Fat1 processing and translocation of Cterminal fragments to mitochondria have yet to be defined, our results suggest a relatively
direct mechanism for sensing the extracellular milieu and relaying signals to mitochondria to
control respiratory chain activity and thereby affect other key metabolic functions. This
mechanism could potentially be targeted in hyperproliferative conditions in the
cardiovascular system, as shown here, or in other scenarios. To this point, the loss or
mutation of Fat1 (refs 8, 9) and the gain of Fat1 expression10,30 have both been linked to
different cancers. In addition, mutations in the FAT1 gene have recently been implicated in
abnormal renal development11 and skeletal muscle formation12, and FAT1 sequence variants
have been associated with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorders13.
The potential contribution of mitochondrial dysregulation in these divergent scenarios is an
area for further study.

terminus of the chimaeric protein. A negative control construct included the IL-2R sequence,
but not the Fat1 ICD. These constructs were transfected into 293T cells (ATCC), from which
total protein lysates were sequentially purified with SBP and CBP beads (InterPlay TAP kit,
Agilent). After gentle washing, purified protein complexes were eluted from CBP beads and
concentrated (UFC500396, Amicon Ultra), resolved by SDS–PAGE, stained with
Coomassie, and submitted for MS/MS analysis (Protein Core Facility, Columbia University)
to identify Fat1 ICD associated proteins. MS/MS-validated proteins were scored on the basis
of their abundance in the Fat1–IL-2R sample in comparison to the IL-2R control using the
ProteoIQ software.

Bioinformatic analysis of the TAP–MS results addressed the 175 potential Fat1 ICD protein
interactors with a MASCOT ratio (Fat1 ICD over control) greater than 2. To identify novel
interactors, we used information on known protein–protein interactions available in the
STRING database31. We downloaded all proteins that interacted with the 175 candidate
interactors at the lowest confidence level in the database (STRING scores greater than 0.15),
and calculated the Page Rank for each node (protein) in the STRING network at different
confidence levels (low, 0.15; medium, 0.40; high, 0.70; highest, 0.90) using the Perl module
Graph::Centrality::Pagerank, available in the CPAN repository (http://www.cpan.org/).
Nodes with high PageRank fractions refer to highly connected proteins more likely to be
pulled down by chance. From the intersection of proteins with ‘high’ and ‘highest’ STRING
confidence scores, we isolated 108 novel Fat1 ICD interactors (Page Rank cutoff of < 0.005)
and performed enrichment analysis with the DAVID Bioinformatics Resource32. Results
were plotted using the EnrichmentMap plugin33 in Cytoscape 3.1 (ref. 34).

Interaction of the Fat1 ICD and endogenous NDUFS3 was assessed using the IL-2R and
Fat1–IL-2R plasmids in TAP-based co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. To
evaluate Fat1-prohibitin (PHB) interaction, PHB cDNA amplified by RT–PCR from mouse
spleen RNA was cloned into pCS2-6XMyc vector to generate a C-terminally tagged PHB–
Myc. DelN Fat1-ICD CMV13-Flag35 and/or PHB pCS2-6XMyc plasmids were transfected
into 293T cells. Protein lysates (300 µg) were pre-cleared with Protein G PLUS agarose
beads (sc-2002, Santa Cruz) and mouse IgG1 isotype control (M075-3M2, MBL). PHB–
Myc was captured with c-Myc beads (sc-40 AC, Santa Cruz), and co-immunoprecipitated
proteins were eluted by boiling and assessed for c-Myc and Flag using immunoblotting.

Wild-type and Fat1KO mouse aortic SMCs were isolated from aortas of 5-week-old control
and Fat1SMKO mice11,24 by collagenase–elastase digestion36. SMCs were maintained in
Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM) containing 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1%
l-glutamine, 100 U ml−1 penicillin, and 100 µg ml−1 streptomycin, and were passaged every
three to four days. Cells between passages two and five were used for experiments; these
early passage cells were not tested for mycoplasma. To evaluate population growth using the
AlamarBlue assay (BUF012A, BIO-RAD), 5,000 cells were plated per well of a 96-well
plate and followed for up to 96 h. Absorbances at 570 nm and 600 nm were measured on a
Synergy 2 microplate reader (BioTek). Reduction of AlamarBlue correlates with the number
of viable cells, and was calculated according to the manufacturer’s specifications and

µM rotenone or DMSO (vehicle) was administered at 0 and 24 h. Human aortic smooth
muscle cells (HASMCs, Clonetics) were maintained in Medium 199 supplemented as
indicated for DMEM, and passaged every four to five days.

To assess proliferation, mouse SMCs were incubated with EdU for six hours before being
fixed, permeabilized, and stained for EdU and total DNA (Hoechst stain), as advised by the
manufacturer (C10337, ThermoFisher Scientific). Fluorescent signals (excitation:emission
(Ex:Em) = 495:519 nm for EdU, 350:461 nm for Hoechst) were measured on a Synergy 2
microplate reader (BioTek), and EdU incorporation was expressed as the ratio of EdU to
Hoechst signals. In some studies, wild-type and Fat1KO cells were transfected with 25 nM of
control or Ndufs3 small interfering RNA (siRNA) (sense sequence 5′GCAGAACCGUUUUGAGAUUTT-3′; s86598, Ambion) on 60 mm culture dishes using
TransIT-X2 (MIR6000, Mirus). The following day, cells were transferred onto 96-well plates
at 2,000 cells per well, and grown for an additional three days before EdU incorporation was
measured. HASMCs were transfected with 12 nM of control or FAT1 siRNA (sense
sequence 5′-CAGCGAAUGUAACAGUACAtt-3′; s5035, Ambion) on 60 mm culture
dishes using TransIT-X2 (MIR6000, Mirus). Two days after transfection, cells were
transferred onto 96-well plates at 3,000 cells per well and grown for an additional two days
before EdU assay.

Co-localization studies were performed as follows: SMCs were seeded onto glass
coverslides, stained with 60 nM Mitotracker Red (M-7512, Life Technologies) for 40 min at
37 °C, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) for 15 min
at 37 °C, blocked overnight (0.2% milk, 2% normal goat serum, 0.1 M glycine, 2% BSA,
and 0.15% Triton-X-100 in PBS), and stained for Fat1 using specific antisera15 and Alexa
Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antisera in 0.2% BSA in PBS. SMCs lacking Fat1
and omission of the primary antibody served as controls for signal specificity. Fluorescent
signals were visualized using a 4-D spinning-disk confocal microscope (Perkin-Elmer) with
a 40× (1.3 NA) objective attached to a digital camera (Orca ER; Hamamatsu). Images were
analysed with the Image-J (v1.48v) software.
Electron micrography of wild-type and Fat1KO SMCs was performed in the Albert Einstein
College of Medicine Analytical Imaging Facility using standard fixation and imaging
procedures. Micrographs were analysed using the Image-J (v1.48v) software.
Mitochondrial studies

Cellular fractions highly enriched for mitochondria were isolated using the Qproteome
Mitochondria Isolation Kit (37612, Qiagen). Cells were lysed and further disrupted by
passing the lysate through a 26-gauge, blunt-end needle, and mitochondria were isolated
using differential centrifugation, followed by density gradient separation. Compartmental
markers such as BiP and GAPDH (Fig. 1c, Extended Data Fig. 5c) indicated efficient though
not absolute fractionation of mitochondrial components.
Mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured using a XF96 Extracellular

were plated on a Seahorse 96-well assay plate at 5,000 cells per well, and tested in minimal
assay media containing 5 mM glucose, 4 mM pyruvate, and 2 mM l-glutamine. The
following drugs were injected to achieve the indicated final concentration: oligomycin (2 µg
ml−1), FCCP (3 µM), and rotenone (2 µM). Total protein was isolated from each well and
quantified for normalization after the assay. When indicated, Fat1KO SMCs were
electroporated (Neon System, Life Technologies) with plasmids encoding Fat1–IL-2R,
Fat1mito, or empty pcDNA3.1 vector, immediately seeded at 6,000 cells per well onto
Seahorse plates, and allowed to recover for three days before measuring OCR. To evaluate
respiration in HASMCs, cells were transfected with 12 nM of control or FAT1 siRNA
(s5035, Ambion) on six-well culture plates using TransIT-X2 (MIR6000, Mirus). Three days
after transfection, HASMCs were re-plated onto Seahorse plates at 3,000 cells per well, and
OCR was measured as described. To evaluate respiration in SMCs after vascular injury,
ligated arteries and their uninjured counterparts were collected from control and Fat1SMKO
mice three days after arterial ligation using the collagenase–elastase method36, seeded on a
Seahorse 96-well plate at 15,000 cells per well, and allowed to recover for ~80 h before
OCR was measured. OCRs from validated mouse aortic SMC cultures were used to
normalize and account for technical variability between experiments.
To target the Fat1 ICD to mitochondria, we assembled the Fat1mito construct, which includes
the first 58 amino acids (with the mitochondrial targeting sequence) of the mouse
thioredoxin-2 protein (GenBank accession NM_019913) and amino acids 4,215–4,591 of
mouse Fat1, and cloned it into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector. Mitochondria-specific
localization of this fusion protein was confirmed by cellular fractionation (Qiagen) of SMCs
and 293T cells, followed by SDS–PAGE and immunoblotting with Fat1 antisera15.

ATP was measured using a bioluminetric assay (30020-1 Biotium, Inc.) in wild-type and
Fat1KO SMCs. Micromolar concentrations of ATP were calculated using a standard curve
and normalized to percentage of AlamarBlue reduction as a surrogate for cell number to
estimate net ATP levels per cell. Data were expressed as fold change respect to wild type.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were assessed by transfection of wild-type and
Fat1KO cells with a thiol redox-sensitive ratiometric sensor, reduction-oxidation-sensitive
GFP (roGFP, Addgene plasmid 49435)37 using TransIT-X2 (MIR6000, Mirus). After two
days, cells were imaged on CELLview glass bottom dishes (5662-7860Q, USA Scientific)
containing buffer with divalent cations (125 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM KH2PO4, 5 mM
glucose, 10 mM NaHCO3, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, and 20 mM HEPES) at 37 °C38.
Live cell images were acquired using IX81ZDC wide-field microscope (Olympus) and a
single CoolsnapHQ2 (Photometrics) cooled CCD-camera on the bottom 100% throughput
port of the microscope. For ratiometric determination of cellular ROS content, cells were
sequentially imaged with a 40× magnification objective lens (Olympus; UIS2 40X DIC N/A
1.3) using excitation light from a 100 W Hg arc lamp and bandpass filter FF390/40
(Semrock) (targeting the 400 nm excitation peak of the oxidized form of roGFP) and
bandpass filter ET470/40 (Chroma Technology) (targeting the 484 nm excitation peak of the
reduced form of roGFP). Fluorescence emissions were detected through a bandpass filter
ET525/50 (Chroma Technology). Neutral density filters of 10% to 25% transmission (ND
1.0–0.6) were routinely used to reduce the intensity of the excitation light to prolong cell

viability. The camera exposure times for 390 nm and 470 nm excitations and the respective
emission detections at 525 nm were maintained at a 2:1 ratio to maximize the light
collection within the dynamic range of the detector. Typically, this was on the order of 200–
600 ms, depending on the expression levels of the roGFP probe in a cell. Cells were imaged
at 10-s intervals for 5 min, and for an additional 15 min after stimulation with 50 µM H2O2.
Images were processed as previously described39. In brief, images were corrected for
camera noise and for uneven illumination within the field of view, followed by background
subtraction and a histogram-threshold-based masking. At each time point, processed images
for each excitation wavelength were divided to obtain the ratiometric (390:470 nm) value,
which was then expressed as fold increase above the average baseline (before H2O2
stimulation) ratio.

Aspartate levels were measured using a colourimetric assay (ab102512 Abcam) in total cell
lysates from wild-type and Fat1KO SMCs. Data was corrected by subtracting the background
as suggested by the manufacturer. Nanomoles of aspartate per sample were calculated using

complex I activity microplate assay kit (ab109721, Abcam) in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions. The rate of oxidation of NADH to NAD+ was measured after
immunocapturing complex I from 200 µg of total protein lysate. Enzymatic (diaphorase)
activity was calculated as the change in absorbance (1,000 × (optical density at 450 nm)) per
minute (abbreviated as mOD/min). Complex II activity was evaluated using the
corresponding assay (ab109908, Abcam), measuring ubiquinol production after
immunocapturing complex II from 100 µg of total protein lysate, with enzymatic activity
measured as a decrease in absorbance at 600 nm per minute (mOD/min). Complex IV
activity was tested using the corresponding assay (ab109911, Abcam), with the rate of
cytochrome C oxidation measured after immunocapturing complex IV from 70 µg of total
protein lysate, and enzymatic activity measured as a decrease in absorbance at 550 nm per
minute (mOD per min). Complex V activity was measured in human aortic SMCs treated
with control or FAT1 siRNA using the ATP synthase enzyme activity microplate assay kit
(ab109714, Abcam). Hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and phosphate was measured after
immunocapturing complex V from 90 µg of total protein lysate. Enzymatic activity was
measured as a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm per minute (mOD per min). Negative
controls were run in every assay, a Synergy 2 microplate reader (BioTek) was used to
measure absorbance, and data were expressed as fold-change respect to wild-type cells.
After the enzymatic assays, plates were washed with PBS, and proteins were eluted from
immunocaptured respiratory complexes by adding 10 µl per well of RIPA buffer with
protease inhibitors plus 6× Laemmli protein loading buffer, and incubating the plate at 85 °C
for 10 min. Recovered proteins were studied by immunoblotting for Fat1 fragments and
respiratory complex subunits.
Respiratory complex conformations were evaluated by blue native (BN)/SDS–PAGE. First
dimension BN–PAGE was performed by solubilizing wild-type and Fat1KO mitochondria

alkylating separated proteins, loading the gel strip onto a 10% Tris-Glycine gel, and
performing SDS–PAGE, following by immunoblotting for specific complex components and

Tagln-cre and Fat1loxP/loxP mice have been described previously11,24. We crossed Tagln-cre
(129SV background) and Fat1loxP/loxP (129SV/C57BL6 mixed background) mice to
generate Fat1loxP/loxP (control) and Fat1loxP/loxP Tagln-cre (Fat1SMKO) mice, using a
breeding strategy to produce both genotypes within the same litter. Eight to ten week old
male mice were studied. All animals were housed in pathogen-free conditions. Procedures
followed rules and regulations of the AAALAC, and were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Vascular
injury in mice was performed using the carotid artery ligation model, as described
previously25. Mice were anaesthetized with ketamine/xylazine. The left common carotid
artery was ligated with 6-0 suture just proximal to the carotid bifurcation, and the
unmanipulated right carotid artery served as a control. Carotid arteries were collected at
different time points up to 14 days after ligation. For collection, mice were euthanized with
ketamine/xylazine and exsanguination, and the central vasculature was flushed with PBS
and perfused with 4% PFA in PBS for 7 min. Arteries were removed, post-fixed with 4%
PFA in PBS overnight, processed before being embedded in paraffin, and cross-sectioned (5
µm thickness) for subsequent studies. Morphometric analysis of arteries was performed
using the ImageJ software as follows: the area of the lumen, the area inside the internal
elastic lamina, and the area inside the external elastic lamina were measured in pixels, and
the areas of the intima and media were calculated. The size of the neointima was expressed
as the intima:media ratio. Areas of medial hyperplasia were measured in pixels and
expressed as percentage of the total medial area. For immunohistochemical evaluation,
arterial sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated. Endogenous peroxidase activity was
neutralized before tissues were boiled in antigen retrieval solution (H-3300, Vector Labs).
Sections were then blocked (2% BSA, 10% normal goat serum, and avidin blocking solution
(Vector Labs) in PBS), incubated with primary antibody (in 2% BSA, 10% normal goat
serum, and biotin blocking solution (Vector Labs) in PBS), incubated with biotinylated
secondary antibody (Vector Labs) at a concentration of 1:500, incubated with ABC reagent
(PK-6100, Vector Labs), incubated with DAB/substrate/chromagen system (K3467, Dako),
and finally, counterstained with haematoxylin (H-3404, Vector Labs). Omission of primary
antibodies served as controls for signal specificity, and the samples were imaged using a
COOLSCOPE digital microscope (Nikon). For immunofluorescence studies, arterial
sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and boiled in antigen retrieval solution (H-3300,
Vector Labs). Sections were then incubated in blocking solution (0.3% Triton-X-100, 2%
BSA, and 10% normal goat serum in PBS) overnight. Primary antibodies were applied in
blocking solution, and fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies were applied in 0.3%
Triton-X-100, 2% BSA in PBS. Omission of primary antibodies served as controls for signal
specificity. The sections were mounted with Fluoro-Gel II (with DAPI) mounting medium

Human coronary artery studies
Staining of human coronary artery samples was performed using formalin-fixed paraffinembedded human coronary artery atherosclerotic plaque sections obtained from the CVPath
Institute Sudden Cardiac Death Registry. To evaluate restenotic samples, we chose artery
segments adjacent to the site of a bare-metal stent implanted within the preceding 30 days.
H&E stain and immunohistochemistry for FAT1 and ACTA2 were performed. The
immunohistochemical staining was developed by NovaRED kit (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA). The images were captured by Axio Scan. Z1 (Zeiss, Germany) using a
20× objective, and figures were prepared on the HALO image analysis platform (Indica
Labs, Corrales, NM).

Statistical analysis

Author Manuscript

In general, at least three independent experiments were performed for each dataset, with a
minimum n number of three biological replicates. No statistical methods were used to
predetermine sample size for in vitro experiments. Comparisons between two groups were
analysed by two-tailed t-test, and comparison between three or more groups were assessed
by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post-hoc test where appropriate. Significance
was accepted for P < 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed and P values were
obtained using the GraphPad Prism software 6.0. In the animal studies, the sample size was
estimated40 for a power of 80% and type I error of 0.05 to detect a 1.5- or 1-fold change in
the size of neointima measured as the intima:media ratio 3 or 14 days after ligation,
respectively. No animals were excluded. The breeding strategy was set up to generate both
genotypes of interest within the same litter and mice were allocated into two groups
according to their genotypes and not by randomization. The investigator who performed
carotid artery ligation remained blinded to group allocation during experiments and outcome
assessments.
