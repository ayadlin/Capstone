BACKGROUND: A better understanding of when cure can be declared in childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) would reduce anxiety and improve quality of life of AML survivors. The authors determined the likelihood that patients with AML would maintain longterm remission after the completion of therapy. METHODS: The cumulative risk of relapse, the time to relapse, event-free survival, and
overall survival were analyzed for 604 patients with AML who were enrolled in 7 successive clinical trials divided into 3 treatment
eras (1976-1991, 1991-1997, and 2002-2008). RESULTS: The median time to relapse did not change over time (0.93 years vs 0.76 years
vs 0.8 years, respectively, for each consecutive era; P 5.22), but the risk of relapse decreased significantly (5-year cumulative incidence of relapse: 52.6% 6 3.1% vs 31.5% 6 3.9% vs 22% 6 3%, respectively, for each consecutive era; P <.001). Among patients who
were in remission 4 years from diagnosis, the probabilities of relapse were 1.7%, 2.9%, and 0.9%, respectively, for each consecutive
era. In the most recent era, all but 1 of 44 relapses occurred within 4 years of diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Children with AML who
receive treatment with contemporary therapy and remain in remission 4 years from diagnosis probably are cured. Although late
relapses and late deaths from other causes are rare, long-term follow-up of survivors is necessary for the timely management of late

INTRODUCTION
The completion of therapy for childhood cancer is a time of both celebration and distress for parents, as fears of relapse are
exacerbated by cessation of chemotherapy that kept the leukemia in remission, longer intervals between clinic visits, fewer
laboratory tests, and less frequent reassurance from hospital staff.1,2 This is further aggravated by the lack of consensus
regarding when a patient who remains in remission can be considered to be leukemia-free and hence cured. A more precise
definition of “cure” not only may alleviate parental stress but also may help cancer survivors overcome social and health
care-related barriers.3
We previously demonstrated that patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who had not received radiation
therapy and were event-free for 10 years had normal life expectancies and thus could be considered cured.3 Although the
treatment success achieved for childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) lags behind that achieved for ALL, refinement of
supportive care, adaptation of therapy based on each patient’s response to early therapy, intensification of chemotherapy,
and the selective use of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) have contributed toward improving outcomes for
children with this disease as well. In most of the recent clinical trials, at least half of the patients have remained leukemiafree after cessation of therapy, with reported event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates surpassing 50% and
60%, respectively.4-10 In light of these improvements, we undertook the current study to determine when “leukemia-free”
status can be declared in childhood AML.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
From January 1976 to June 2008, 604 patients aged 21 years with newly diagnosed AML (excluding those with acute
promyelocytic leukemia, Down syndrome, and treatment-related AML) were enrolled in 7 successive clinical trials

(AML76, AML80, AML83, AML87, AML91, AML97,
and AML02).4,11-17 Briefly, AML76 included a lowintensity induction regimen of weekly vincristine, daunorubicin, cytarabine, and 6-azauradine, followed by 2.5
years of postremission therapy.11 The AML80 trial used a
more intensive induction regimen (daunorubicin and
cytarabine) followed by allogeneic HSCT for patients
with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling
donors and 1 year of intensive chemotherapy for those
without donors.12 AML83 introduced a 5-drug induction
given as intensive, rotating pairs followed by 16 cycles of
postremission therapy given over 22 months.13 Prolonged
postremission maintenance therapy was eliminated in all
subsequent trials, which included approximately 6
months of intensive chemotherapy or HSCT. Patients in
the AML87 trial received 6 cycles of chemotherapy, with
the dosages of etoposide and cytarabine adjusted on the
basis of plasma concentrations.14 The AML91 protocol15
introduced cladribine in an upfront window, whereas the
AML97 protocol16 included an initial course of cladribine
plus cytarabine. In contrast to the earlier, singleinstitution trials, the multi-institutional AML02 study, a
randomized comparison of high-dose versus low-dose
cytarabine-based induction therapy, was the first study to
use minimal residual disease levels to determine risk categories and treatment assignments.4 All treatment protocols were approved by the institutional review boards,
with signed informed consent obtained from the parents
or guardians and assent from the patients, as appropriate.
Survivors who were treated at St. Jude Children’s
Research Hospital and who have been in remission for 5
years are evaluated annually in our After Completion of
Therapy Clinic, and yearly questionnaires are mailed to
the alumni survivors who are aged 18 years.
Statistical Analysis

OS was defined as the time elapsed from study enrollment
to death; and EFS was defined as the time from study
enrollment to induction failure, withdrawal, relapse, secondary malignancy, or death, and those who remained
alive and event-free at the last follow-up were considered
censored. EFS and OS were estimated using the KaplanMeier method,18 and associated standard errors were calculated using the method of Peto et al.19 The cumulative
incidence functions of failure caused by a specific cause
(relapse, development of a second neoplasm, or death in
remission) were estimated using the method of Kalbfleisch and Prentice,20 and the functions were compared
using the Gray test.21 For the analyses of relapse, death
in remission and second neoplasms were considered

competing events in the estimation of cumulative incidence of relapse. The Fine and Gray model for competing
risks and Cox regression models were used to identify independent risk factors for relapse and EFS, respectively.
The actuarial risk of relapse among survivors in the
AML02 trial (Era 3) was estimated with the Poisson
model. The number of relapses with an observed duration
of person-years of follow-up was assumed to follow a Poisson distribution. The upper confidence bound of the
expected number of relapses in a given number of personyears of follow-up was determined by using the exact
upper confidence bound of the Poisson rate based on the
observed numbers of relapses and person-years of followup. To provide a conservative estimate of the actuarial risk
of relapse among 4-year event-free survivors, a sensitivity
analysis was performed on the unlikely assumption of up
to 4 additional hypothetical relapses occurring during 2
additional years of follow-up. The Kruskall-Wallis exact
test was used to test equality of the median of time to
relapse among protocols or treatment era, and P values
were determined by 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations. All
analyses were performed using SAS software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) in Windows version 9.2 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Wash).

RESULTS
Outcome According to Treatment Era

Among the 604 patients enrolled on 7 consecutive AML
trials from 1976 to 2008, 292 are alive and in remission.
The remaining 312 patients have died, including 74 during induction therapy or after failing to achieve remission,
190 after relapse, and 48 from treatment-related complications. Treatment outcomes were similar among patients
treated on the AML76 through AML87 protocols and
among those treated on the AML91 and AML97 protocols, as indicated in Table 1. Therefore, we performed
subsequent analyses with cohorts of patients defined by
treatment era (Era 1, 1976-1991; Era 2, 1991-1997; and
Era 3, 2002-2008) (Table 2 and Fig. 1). The overall clinical outcomes improved over the 3 treatment periods: the
5-year EFS rates (6 standard error) were 22.4% 6 2.6%
in Era 1 versus 45.9% 6 4.1% in Era 2 versus
62.7% 6 4.3% in Era 3 (P < .001) (Fig. 1A); and the OS
rates were 29.4% 6 2.9% versus 54.1% 6 4.1% versus
72.5% 6 3.9%, respectively (P < .001) (Fig. 1B). The 5year cumulative incidence of relapse decreased correspondingly from 52.6% 6 3.1% to 31.5% 6 3.9% and
then to 22% 6 3% in the most recent era (P < .001) (Fig.
1C). Among patients who achieved remission, the

majority of events were relapses, which comprised 87.7%
of events in Era 1, 73.4% of events Era 2, and 72.1% of
events in Era 3. Other events in Era 3 included 11 induction failures (5.3%), 17 deaths in remission (8.4%), and 3
withdrawals from the study (1.5%), which were considered as competing events in the cumulative incidence
analysis of relapse.
Univariate analysis demonstrated that, in addition
to treatment era, clinical and biologic presenting features
also were associated with outcome (Supporting Table 1;
see online supporting information). Thus, older age,
higher leukocyte count, and the presence of megakaryoblastic leukemia were correlated with inferior OS and
2492

EFS, whereas female gender and the presence of the
t(8;21) translocation or the inv(16) inversion were favorable predictors. It is noteworthy that treatment on
AML02 was associated with a significantly superior outcome. Cox proportional hazards modeling performed
with age, leukocyte count, French-American-British
(FAB) subtype, and karyotype as predictors and stratified
by treatment era demonstrated that age >10 years, a leukocyte count >50 3 109/L, and the presence of megakaryoblastic leukemia were associated with a worse outcome
(Supporting Table 2; see online supporting information).
The only factor that was associated with superior OS and
EFS in the multivariable analysis was the presence of

for patients who were treated on AML02 and, thus, were
not included in the analyses. Among patients who
attained remission, leukocyte count, sex, and treatment
era were significantly associated with relapse, whereas
only age was associated with death in remission (Supporting Table 1; see online supporting information).

The median time to relapse was similar for patients treated
across the different periods (Era 1, 0.93 years; Era 2, 0.76
years; Era 3, 0.8 years; P 5 .22) (Table 2). There were no
significant differences in the distributions of FAB subtype
(P 5 .16) or karyotype (P 5 .81) between patients who
relapsed earlier than 12 months from diagnosis compared
with those who relapsed later. Among patients who
achieved remission, 6 (1.1%) had a leukemia relapse 3 to
4 years after diagnosis, 3 (0.6%) had a relapse between
years 4 and 5, and only 1 (0.2%) had a relapse after 5
years. Relapses that occurred more than 4 years after diagnosis comprised 1.8% (4 of 226 patients) of all relapses
and 1.4% of all adverse events among patients who
achieved remission. Other events that occurred 4 years after diagnosis included 7 second malignant neoplasms and
5 deaths in remission (Table 3). Figure 2 illustrates the
risk of relapse or other event (induction failure, death, or
second malignancy) per year, adjusted for the number of
patients at risk, for the entire cohort (Fig. 2A) and for
patients treated in Era 3 (Fig. 2B). The probabilities of
subsequent relapse for patients who remained in first
remission for 4 years after diagnosis in the 3 consecutive
treatment eras were 1.7% in Era 1, 2.9% in Era 2, and
0.9% in Era 3 (Fig. 3).
Among the 128 patients in AML02 who completed
all treatment and remained alive and event-free at the
time of this analysis, 108 patients (84.4%) had been followed for 4 years after diagnosis, representing 689.5
person-years of follow-up. The 95% and 99% upper confidence bounds of the expected number of relapses per
100 person-years of follow-up beyond 4 years from diagnosis were 0.68 and 0.96, respectively. To provide a conservative estimate of the future risk of relapse among the
4-year event-free survivors, we performed a sensitivity
analysis covering a range of scenarios, in which 1 to 4 hypothetical additional relapses could occur during 2 additional years of follow-up. The analyses revealed a 99%
upper confidence bound for the actuarial risk of from
1.39 to 2.44 relapses per 100 person-years of follow-up,
indicating a low risk of further relapse (Supporting Table
3; see online supporting information).
Survival After Relapse

Survival after relapse was dismal in Era 1 (8.9% 6 2.4%
at 5 years), increased to 23.4% 6 5.9% in Era 2, and
increased to 28% 6 10.6% in Era 3. In all eras, however,
the median time from relapse to death was short: 0.53
years (range, 0.01-10.22 years), 0.37 years (range, 0-2.39
years), and 0.43 years (range, 0.03-2.98 years),

respectively. Among the 91 patients who relapsed in Eras
2 and 3, 53 died during the first year, 10 died during the
second year, and 3 died during the third year after relapse.
There were no deaths >3 years from the time of relapse.
Outcome was significantly better for patients who
relapsed >6 months from diagnosis compared with those
who relapsed earlier (3-year OS from relapse,
14.3% 6 6.6% vs 28.9% 6 5.6%; P 5 .029).
DISCUSSION
The risk of relapse of childhood AML has decreased dramatically over the past 3 decades, from greater than 50%
in the 1980s to less than 25% in the most recent trials.
The current study demonstrates that, despite this improvement in overall outcome, the timing of relapse has not
changed. In all treatment eras analyzed, the median time
to relapse was less than 1 year, and the risk of relapse
among patients who were event-free 4 years from diagnosis
was less than 3%. Notably, in the AML02 trial, the risk of
relapse 4 years from diagnosis was less than 1%, and no
relapses were observed after 5 years. The similarities in the
timing of relapses across treatment eras implies that our
therapies, which have been based on similar chemotherapeutic agents for greater than 30 years, are effective at
eradicating leukemia-initiating cells in an increasing proportion of patients; however, the small number of late
relapses suggests that the stem cells may be quiescent
rather than eliminated in a subset of patients.22-24
In our study, 5 of the 16 patients who experienced
first events >4 years from diagnosis died in remission: 2
from pulmonary fibrosis related to allogeneic HSCT, 2
from hepatitis C related to blood transfusions, and 1 from
suicide; all of these patients were treated in the 1980s.

We have not observed late deaths in remission from similar causes in patients who were treated during the past 2
decades, and we believe that these will continue to be
exceedingly rare. Other late events included 3 cases of thyroid papillary carcinoma, 2 cases of breast cancer, 1 choroid plexus carcinoma, and 1 case of myelodysplastic
syndrome. Although we have not observed any cases of
second malignant neoplasm among patients treated on
the AML97 or AM02 protocols, it will be important to
continue to monitor these patients diligently.
According to our study, most patients who are in
first remission 4 years from diagnosis will become longterm survivors. Nevertheless, AML treatment continues
to have long-term sequelae. In an analysis of 77 AML survivors, we previously reported that growth, neurocognitive, and endocrine abnormalities were common,
especially among patients who underwent HSCT.25 A
Childhood Cancer Survivor Study analysis of 272 AML
survivors who did not undergo HSCT indicated that 50%
of the survivors reported a chronic medical condition,
>25% reported at least 2 conditions, and 16% reported a
severe or life-threatening condition.26 Despite these
issues, rates of marriage, pregnancy, high school graduation, employment, and health insurance coverage were
similar among survivors and their siblings.26 In both studies, the cumulative incidence of second malignant neoplasm was low, as was the incidence of cardiac
disease.25,26 However, since 2002, AML trials in the
United States have used higher cumulative doses of
anthracyclines (approximately 450 mg/m2) than earlier
trials, suggesting that the prevalence of late cardiotoxicity
may increase to the levels observed in the United Kingdom.27 Long-term follow-up according to international
guidelines is essential.28
In summary, our results demonstrate that children
with AML who remain in complete remission for at least 4
years from the time of diagnosis have an extremely low risk
(<1%) of relapse, and those who are in complete remission
at 5 years may be considered cured. For patients who
relapse, those who are alive 3 years from the time of relapse
are likely to be cured as well. These milestones should
reduce the anxiety and fears that patients and their parents
experience at the time of cessation of therapy and at subsequent clinic visits. These data might also help patients overcome the barriers to insurance coverage and health care
access often experienced by long-term survivors.
