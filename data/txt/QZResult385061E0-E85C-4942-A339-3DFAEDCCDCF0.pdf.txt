Abstract
Chromosomal instability (CIN) refers to genomic instability in which cells have
gained or lost chromosomes or chromosomal fragments. A high level of CIN is common
in solid tumours and is associated with cancer drug resistance and poor prognosis.
The impact of CIN-induced stress and the resulting cellular responses are only just
beginning to emerge. Using proliferating tissue in Drosophila as a model, we found
that autophagy is activated in CIN cells and is necessary for their survival. Specifically,
increasing the removal of defective mitochondria by mitophagy is able to lower levels
of reactive oxygen species and the resultant cellular damage that is normally seen in
CIN cells. In response to DNA damage, CIN is increased in a positive feedback loop,
and we found that increasing autophagy by Tor depletion could decrease the level
of CIN in proliferating cells. These findings underline the importance of autophagy
control in the development of CIN tumours.

INTRODUCTION

to maintain metabolic homeostasis and prevent the buildup of dysfunctional cellular components [9]. The aberrant
regulation of autophagy has been seen in several diseases,
especially in neurodegenerative disease and cancer [10–12],
as well as in cells in which aneuploidy has been induced
[13–15]. However, whether autophagy is protective or
deleterious in the development of cancer has been widely
debated [16]. The information currently available from
clinical trials and mouse models suggests that a lack of
autophagy predisposes tissue to develop tumours, possibly
because autophagy normally moderates oxidative stress
and DNA damage by removing defective mitochondria.
However, in some model systems, autophagy is essential for
the growth of the tumour [17, 18]. Consequently there are
now ongoing clinical trials evaluating the combination of
inhibition of autophagy with chemotherapeutics [19, 20]. The
expectation is that tumours may need autophagy to tolerate
the metabolic demands of proliferation, to avoid excessive
oxidative stress and consequently an unmanageable level of
genome instability. Thus reduced autophagy may promote
tumorigenesis by increasing DNA damage rates, but for
tumours to thrive they may need to increase their autophagic
flux to prevent deleterious levels of oxidative damage.

Chromosomal instability (CIN) refers to the process
by which cells are unable to maintain chromosomal
integrity or number [1]. Chromosomal instability (CIN)
or genomic instability (GIN) has been suggested as a
pivot hallmark of cancer which facilitates the acquisition
of other cancer hallmarks required for tumorigenesis [2].
CIN is seen in most human solid tumours and the genetic
variation it generates can account for the development
of drug resistance and the poor prognosis of CIN cancer
patients [3, 4]. It has been proposed that CIN itself could
be an attractive target for chemotherapy, as it is a relatively
cancer-specific phenotype [5–7]. However, little is known
about which properties of CIN cells might allow CIN
tumours to be efficiently killed.
Autophagy is a normal cellular pathway for the
degradation and recycling of unnecessary or dysfunctional
cellular components [8–10]. The process of autophagy
involves the sequestration of cytoplasmic material by doublemembrane phagophores to form autophagosomes that then
fuse with lysosomes to enable degradation of their cargo
[8]. Autophagy is induced in response to various stresses

In characterizing pathways which facilitate the
survival of CIN cells, we have previously reported
that CIN cells are sensitive to changes in glycolysis
or antioxidant enzymes and generate elevated levels
of reactive oxygen species [21]. Based on that study,
we carried out further screening for candidates whose
depletion can specifically kill CIN cells. In this process,
we found that when CIN is induced in otherwise normal
cells, they become sensitive to the depletion of autophagy.
Here we show that CIN leads to an increase in autophagy,
and that autophagy is needed to limit reactive oxygen
species, DNA damage and cell death in CIN cells.
Furthermore, elevated levels of autophagy promote the
survival of CIN cells.
Altogether, our research highlights the significance
of understanding autophagy pathways as a potential
therapeutic target for the treatment of CIN tumours.

dramatically increased levels of oxidative stress and DNA
damage in CIN cells (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure S1).
Furthermore, depletion of Atg1 or Atg18 in CIN cells
resulted in a significant increase in apoptosis as detected
by active caspase staining (Figure 3). Elevated levels of
cell death were seen when autophagy was blocked in
either CIN model (Supplementary Figure S2). However,
depleting Atg1 or Atg18 in normal proliferating cells
had no detectable effect on ROS levels, DNA damage or
apoptosis. These results are consistent with a protective
role for autophagy in response to cellular stresses [28], and
showed that that autophagy activation was required for the
survival of CIN cells.

Enhancing autophagic flux rescues oxidative
stress levels and apoptosis in CIN cells
Having observed that CIN cells required autophagy
to avoid cell death, we wished to see whether enhancing
autophagic flux could improve the survival of CIN cells.
Autophagy induction is regulated by conserved upstream
signalling pathways that converge on the target of
rapamycin (TOR) kinase, which prevents autophagy by
inhibiting Atg1 [26, 29]. By the removal of the autophagy
inhibitor Tor using RNAi, we found that enhancing
autophagic flux (Supplementary Figure S4) could rescue
the oxidative stress and apoptosis phenotype in CIN cells
(Figure 4, Supplementary Figure S3). This suggested that
autophagy is not normally induced enough to protect cells
with high levels of CIN, and that elevated autophagy,
which is often seen in cancer [7, 8], can improve the
survival of these cells.

RESULTS
Autophagy is activated when CIN is induced in
proliferating cells
We have previously used RNA interference
knockdown of the spindle assembly checkpoint gene mad2
or cohesin gene rad21 to generate inducible CIN models
with different CIN levels [22]. From this work, and that
of others [23] it has become clear that aneuploidy is
associated with elevated levels of reactive oxygen species
(ROS). We expected that in response, CIN cells would
induce autophagy to recycle damaged macromolecules.
To test autophagy levels in cells with induced CIN, we
initially used lysotracker staining, which was elevated
in both mad2 and rad21 CIN cells relative to normally
proliferating cells (Figure 1A–1C). To confirm this result
we examined the levels of a tagged form of Atg8a [24]. In
line with the lysotracker staining, we found robust Atg8a
puncta formation in rad21 CIN cells indicating autophagy
activation (Figure 1F). Stronger induction of autophagy
was seen in rad21 CIN cells than in mad2 CIN cells
(Figure 1A–1F), consistent with the higher level of CIN
generated in the rad21 model [22].

Autophagy of mitochondria is needed in CIN
cells to prevent ROS and cell death
One function of autophagy activation is the
removal of defective mitochondria through pink1/
parkin-mediated mitophagy [30]. CIN is known to cause
defective mitochondria and increased oxidative stress in
cells [21, 22], therefore, we checked whether mitophagy
is involved in the response to CIN. We found that
overexpression of the essential mitophagy gene parkin
reduced the level of ROS and apoptosis in CIN cells at
least as effectively as increasing general autophagy by
Tor depletion (Figure 4). Consistent with this, depletion
of Parkin significantly increased apoptosis in CIN cells,
but not normal cells (Supplementary Figure S5). If
removal of defective mitochondria is an essential function
in CIN cells, we would expect to detect mitochondria
being processed by autophagy in CIN cells. To test this
we visualized autophagosomes with mCherry-Atg8 and
mitochondria with mito-GFP (Figure 5). In CIN cells we
observed cytoplasmic accumulations of Atg8, marking
the autophagosomes, and in approximately 20% of cases
(127 of 600) they contained mito-GFP. In some cells the

Reducing autophagy leads to increased oxidative
stress and apoptosis in CIN cells
Having found that autophagy is activated in CIN
cells, we hypothesized that robust autophagy activation
might be particularly needed for the survival of CIN
cells. In order to address this hypothesis, we depleted
the essential autophagy genes Atg1 or Atg18a [25, 26]
by RNA interference in CIN cells. Atg1 is needed for a
functional autophagy induction complex and leads to
the recruitment of Atg18/WIPI2, which is needed for
Atg8 recruitment and phagosome function [25, 27]. We
found that knocking down either Atg1 or Atg18 led to

hypothesis, we checked the frequency of aneuploid
metaphases after autophagy enhancement and compared
them with the frequency seen in CIN cells or CIN cells
in which cell death had been blocked by expressing the
apoptosis inhibitor p35. Blocking apoptosis allowed the
retention of many more aneuploid cells in CIN tissue, but
by contrast we found that enhanced autophagic flux could
significantly reduce the CIN level in a proliferating tissue
(Figure 5).

mitochondrial network appeared to be interrupted by the
presence of the autophagosomes, or the mito-GFP signal
was compromised where it fell in an autophagosome
relative to the adjacent mitochondria. Control cells did not
have large autophagosomes or any striking co-localization
with mito-GFP. These results suggest that mitochondria
in CIN cells can be removed by autophagy and that this
process is necessary for the survival of CIN cells.

Enhancing autophagic flux reduces the level of
CIN in proliferating cells

Discussion

It has been reported that defective autophagy
increases the level of CIN in cancer cells due to increased
DNA damage and gene amplification [31]. Conversely, we
would expect treatments that decrease DNA damage to
lower CIN levels. As enhancing autophagic flux reduced
the level of ROS (Figure 4), and we have previously shown
that DNA damage in CIN cells is caused by elevated ROS
[21], we wished to test whether increasing autophagy
could moderate the CIN level. In order to address this

Autophagy can function as a pro-survival protective
pathway in cancer cells to fulfil their metabolic demands
for rapid cell proliferation and to respond to cellular
stresses that may include genomic instability and
metabolic stress [31–34]. Therefore, we assessed the level
of autophagy in cells with induced CIN and found a robust
activation of autophagy (Figure 1). As would be expected
for a tissue with random mitotic defects, not every cell
showed elevated autophagy. The frequency of elevated

autophagy was significantly higher in the high-CIN cells
generated by Rad21 depletion, which also have a high
frequency of elevated ROS generation, DNA damage
and aneuploidy [22]. This is consistent with data from
human cells showing that increased levels of aneuploidy
correlate with elevated Atg8/LC3 and p62 [13, 14]. In that
work, the effect of ongoing karyotypic variation (CIN) on

autophagy was not tested, possibly because it is difficult
to maintain proliferation in vertebrate CIN cells without
additional changes such as p53 loss [1], which would itself
impact autophagy. In the case of CIN cells, we found that
p62 levels are decreased, indicating effective clearance by
higher autophagic flux, as opposed to stable aneuploids in
which p62 has been reported to accumulate [13]. Because

comparison the elevated ROS generated by a high CIN rate. Representative discs are shown; a clear difference from the wild type anterior

activating autophagy by starvation is thought to rescue
the autophagy defect in stable aneuploid cells [13], we
explain the difference in our results by suggesting that
in stable single chromosome aneuploids there may be

insufficient activation of autophagy, while our CIN
models give robust autophagy induction, giving effective
removal of p62 as well as mitophagy. The genomic
imbalance caused by gain of a single chromosome in

human cells is relatively minor (< 9%) while aneuploidy
for even a single major chromosome in Drosophila can
alter the genome by more than 30%, so it is not surprising
that our CIN model evokes more robust cellular adaptive
responses.

We found that activation of autophagy was vital
for the survival of CIN cells, as it is for stable trisomics
[35], as inhibiting autophagy led to increased oxidative
stress, DNA damage and massive apoptosis in CIN cells
(Figure 2, Figure 3, Supplementary Figure S1 and S2).

antibody was used to stain the level of apoptosis in cells while CellRox staining was used to detect the level of oxidative stress. The

wild type. Enhancing autophagy by Tor knockdown (engrailed > Gal4, UAS-CD8-GFP, UAS-TorRNAi, UAS-rad21RNAi, UAS-Dicer2) (B, E)
reduced the level of oxidative stress (B) and apoptosis (E) observed in CIN cells relative to the CIN alone controls (A, D). A similar
reduction in oxidative stress (C) and apoptosis (F) was observed in CIN cells when mitophagy was induced by the overexpression of Parkin
(engrailed > Gal4, UAS-CD8-GFP, UAS-parkin, UAS-rad21RNAi, UAS-Dicer2). Quantification of the cleaved caspase3 staining is shown

On the other hand, we found that enhancing autophagic
flux by depletion of Tor could significantly reduce the
level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis
in CIN cells (Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure S3).
Depleting Tor has numerous cellular effects including

reduced translation, lipid and nucleotide synthesis and
increased cap independent translation [36, 37], all of
which are likely to impact CIN cell survival. However,
the significance of autophagy as part of this response is
clear from the cell death when autophagy is specifically

GFP (A, D, G, J) was used to mark mitochondria and mCherry-Atg8 (B, E, H, K) was used to detect autophagosomes in third instar larval
wing discs. Merged images are shown in (C, F, I, L) with mito-GFP in green and mCherry-Atg8 in red. CIN cells induced by Rad21
depletion (D–I, btub > mito-GFP, UAS-mCherry-Atg8, engrailed > Gal4, UAS-rad21RNAi, UAS-Dicer2) showed co-localization (arrowed)
of mitochondria (F) and large autophagosomes (G) while such autophagosomes were not seen in cells without CIN (A–C, btub > mitoGFP, UAS-mCherry-Atg8, engrailed > Gal4). Some cells showed interruption of the mitochondrial network by autophagosomes (J–L,
arrowheads), or decreased mito-GFP signal from mitochondria in the area containing an autophagosome (G–I, arrowed). The level of CIN
was evaluated by the frequency of aneuploid metaphases (M). Rad21 depletion gave aneuploidy in 39% of metaphase cells, or 70% if cell
death was blocked by expression of p35, while the level of CIN in Rad21 depleted cells could be significantly reduced to 22% by Tor knock
down. The p value was calculated using Fisher’s exact test, n > 240 for each genotype. Representative control euploid (N, O) and CIN cell
aneuploid karyotypes (P, Q) are shown.

reduced: our findings are consistent with a protective role
for autophagy in response to aneuploidy and the redox
stress that comes with aneuploidy [28, 38]. It is interesting
that the CIN should invoke a protective response as
well as the cell lethal immune responses that remove
defective cells [22]. Our interpretation is that autophagy
is a buffering process that can manage stresses within the
normal range and prevent any auto-immune responses,
but this has a limit beyond which damaged mitochondria
accumulate, the redox stress signals are produced and the
immune response is triggered.
Autophagy has been reported to suppress CIN in
tumour cells, however, the detailed mechanism is not clear
[31]. In this study, we found that enhancing autophagic
flux could reduce the level of CIN in Drosophila
proliferating cells (Figure 5). We examined the possibility
of chromatid removal by autophagy [39], but failed to
observe any co-localization of DNA with autophagosomes
in mitotic cells (Figure 5 and data not shown), suggesting
that autophagy does not directly degrade lagging
chromosomes in our CIN models. However, we found
co-localization of mitochondria and autophagosomes
suggesting that defective mitochondria are degraded by
autophagy (mitophagy) (Figure 5). Furthermore, we
found that overexpression of the mitophagy regulator
parkin [30, 40] could significantly rescue the level of
ROS and apoptosis in CIN cells while depletion of Parkin
to block mitochondrial turnover had the opposite effect

(Supplementary Figure S5). Although mitochondria are
built to tolerate ROS by producing localized antioxidants
such as superoxide dismutase, it is not surprising that the
high levels of ROS produced by mitochondria in CIN
cells [21] should damage them to the point where they
require mitophagy [41]. In the absence of this quality
control system, we observed high rates of DNA damage.
Our interpretation of these data is that the CIN rate is
responding primarily to the level of DNA damage: when
autophagy is increased the level of ROS and DNA damage
in CIN cells is lowered, so the CIN rate is correspondingly
less. DNA damage is a well-described driver of CIN rates
[42] that we have shown is responsive to ROS levels in
CIN cells [21], however other responses to autophagy may
also contribute. While decreasing autophagy might be an
effective mechanism for pre-tumourous tissue to increase
its mutation rate, tumours need to balance their level of
CIN to avoid intolerable genotoxic stress [43]. Modulating
mitophagy is likely to play a key part in fine tuning the
rate of CIN to an adaptive level.
In conclusion, our data suggests that autophagy
effectively removes defective mitochondria in CIN
cells thus reducing the level of ROS, DNA damage and
apoptosis in CIN cells. Moreover, the reduced level of ROS
and DNA damage further mitigate the level of CIN (Figure
6). Our study reveals a mechanism by which autophagy
limits CIN in cells, which underscores the importance of
understanding autophagy in CIN tumour treatment.

Figure 6: A model for the effect of autophagy on the survival of CIN cells. Chromosomal instability leads to metabolic stress
and the production of reactive oxygen species, which in turn cause defective mitochondria and further oxidative stress. Autophagy can be
activated to effectively remove the defective mitochondria and thus reduce the level of oxidative stress, DNA damage and apoptosis in CIN
cells. Moreover, autophagy could reduce the level of CIN by reducing DNA damage in CIN cells.

overnight at 4ºC. Discs were washed in PBSTw before and
after secondary antibodies were added for 2 hrs at room
temperature, and discs were mounted in 80% glycerol.
All images are of 3rd instar larval wing discs. The region
expressing RNAi was marked with CD8-GFP by the use
of UAS-CD8-GFP driven in the same engrailed pattern
as the RNAi transcript as indicated in the figure legends.
Where shown, RNAi to the non-Drosophila gene mCherry
was used as a control instead of wild type to ensure that
expression of an RNAi construct in this tissue did not have
an effect irrespective of its target. The details of antibodies
used in this study are listed here: The primary antibodies
are Rabbit anti-cleaved caspase3 (D175, 1:100) (Cell
Signalling); Rabbit anti-Phospho-H2AVD (Rockland, Lot#
30352, 1:700), rabbit anti-Drosophila p62 (generous gift
of Prof. Juhasz, Budapest, 1:150). The secondary antibody
is CY3 anti-rabbit (1:200). Quantification of cleaved
Caspase3 staining was normalized by subtracting the
average signal from the wild type anterior compartment
from the average signal in the engrailed-Gal4 driven
mutant posterior compartment (marked with mCD8-GFP),
using ImageJ software. A minimum of 9 discs were used
for each quantitation as described in the relevant figure
legends.

Drosophila stocks
The fly stocks used in this paper are as follows:
mad2-RNAi (VDRC 47918), Rad21-RNAi (Bloomington
#36786), mcherry-Atg8a [24], Atg1-RNAi (VDRC 16133),
Atg18-RNAi (VDRC 22643), Tor-RNAi (VDRC 35578),
mCherry-RNAi (Bloomington 35785), Parkin-RNAi
(VDRC 104363), UAS-park (Bloomington #34746),
UAS-mito-GFP (Bloomington #8442), engrailed-Gal4
(Bloomington #30564).

Lysotracker and Acridine Orange staining
Lysotracker staining was used to detect autophagy
in larval wing imaginal discs. The dissected imaginal
discs were transferred from PBS and incubated in 1 µM
lysotracker (Lysotracker red DND-99, Invitrogen) and
6 μg/ml Hoechst (Hoechst 33342, Sigma) for 5 mins and
then mounted to a slide with PBS for microscopy after a
quick wash in PBS.
Acridine Orange (Invitrogen) was used to identify
the level of cell death in the engrailed driven third instar
larval wing discs. Imaginal wing discs were selected
and dissected in PBS, then stained for 2 min in a 1 µM
Acridine Orange solution, rinsed briefly, mounted
and imaged in PBS. For quantitation, the stain was
normalized by subtracting the average Acridine orange
signal of the wild type anterior compartment from the
average Acridine orange signal in the engrailed-Gal4
driven mutant posterior compartment (marked with
mCD8-GFP), using ImageJ software. To reduce noise,
background subtraction (rolling ball radius at 10 pixels)
was done in all the images [12].

Imaging
The microscopy of CellROX, Acridine Orange
staining, and immuno-staining was done on a Zeiss
Axioplan2 microscope. The microscopy of mCherryAtg8 and mitoGFP co-localization was obtained using a
Zeiss LSM-700 confocal inverted microscope with Argon
ion 488 nm (14 mW) and Green HeNe 543 nm (1.5 mW)
lasers. The dual labelled samples were imaged with two
separate channels (PMT tubes) in a sequential setting.
Green fluorescence was excited with an Ar 488 nm laser
line, and the emission was viewed through a HQ515/30 nm
narrow band barrier filter in PMT1. Red fluorescence was
excited with a HeNe 543 nm laser line, and the emission
was viewed through a long pass barrier filter (E570LP) in
PMT2. Confocal images shown are from a single plane of
focus and show structures that are not visible when imaged
1.5 μm higher or lower, suggesting colocalization rather
than overlap of out-of-focus signals. Images were captured
using the Zen (Jena, Germany) software and compiled
using Photoshop and Illustrator CS5 (Adobe).

Oxidative stress assay
The fluorogenic probe CellROX (Life Technologies)
was used to measure the level of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) in CIN cells as detailed in [21]. Briefly, imaginal
wing discs from third instar larvae were dissected in D22
media (pH 6.8), then placed in 5 µM CellROX in D22
media (D22 insect culture medium: pH 6.8) for 15 minutes
in the dark at room temperature. Discs were then quickly
washed in PBS and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for
5 minutes. Fixed discs were then mounted in 80% glycerol
and observed under a fluorescence microscope.

Data analysis
Further details of data analysis are described in
[21] and [22], including normalization of the signal from
half wing discs to compensate for variations in staining
intensity and background subtraction for Acridine Orange
staining. Quantitation was carried out using ImageJ and
statistical analysis was carried out using GraphPad Prism.
All error bars represent 95% confidence intervals for the

Immunostaining
The standard method for immunostaining in our
lab has been used in this study [21]. Briefly, wing discs
were dissected in PBS, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for
20 min, then blocked with PBS plus 0.2% Tween-20
before being incubated with primary antibodies, usually
