BACKGROUND: Management of asymptomatic early stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) centered on expectant surveillance for active disease warranting chemotherapy. In CLL, elevated serum b-2 microglobulin (b2M) levels
were associated with more rapid disease progression and shorter survival (OS). METHODS: An early intervention trial
was designed to assess response, time-to-progression (TTP), and OS after immunotherapy with standard-dose rituximab (375 mg/m2 intravenously weekly for 8 consecutive weeks) in 34 asymptomatic untreated early stage CLL with
b2M level  2 mg/dL. RESULTS: Long-term follow-up and results are reported. The overall response rate in 34
patients was 82% (9% complete [CR]), median TTP in the 28 responders was 23 months, the median time to subsequent treatment was 43 months, and the 8-year OS rate was 74% (median follow-up, 102 months). CONCLUSIONS:
Early treatment with rituximab was well tolerated and safe. Further studies are needed to determine if this intervenC 2011 American Cancer Society.

KEYWORDS: chronic lymphocytic leukemia, rituximab, therapy, early stage.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a heterogeneous disease with an extremely variable course.1 Patients with

‘‘smoldering’’ CLL appear to have a life span similar to age-matched controls in the general population.2,3 Similarly, early
stage asymptomatic CLL (Rai stage 0-II without active disease as defined by the National Cancer Institute Working
Group [NCI-WG] Criteria) is associated with a favorable prognosis with a reported median overall survival (OS) that
ranges from 8 to 12 years.2,4 Currently, management of asymptomatic early stage CLL centers on expectant surveillance
for active disease warranting chemotherapy. However, survival outcomes vary considerably within this subset depending
on prognostic factors at presentation. Early stage patients with unfavorable features are at higher risk for disease progression, and, therefore, may benefit from early intervention rather than the traditional watch-and-wait approach.
The large randomized clinical trials conducted by the French Cooperative Group in the 1980s for asymptomatic
early stage CLL were limited to potentially toxic chemotherapeutics (alkylating agents).5,6 Early treatment with daily
chlorambucil or intermittent chlorambucil/prednisone was associated with slower disease progression, but not longer survival when compared with the observation arms. The lack of survival benefit was attributed to selection of resistant CLL
clones due to early exposure to chlorambucil, limited availability at that time of effective salvage regimens, and excess
deaths from secondary epithelial cancers. With regard to the clinical course of the disease, these randomized trials showed
that at least 40% of patients with early stage CLL eventually require therapy for progressive disease, and that approximately 25% ultimately die of disease-related causes.
One recognized risk factor for progression in CLL is elevated serum b-2 microglobulin (b2M), a 12-kDa light chain
protein that binds to the a-chain of major histocompatability class 1 antigens and dissociates into extracellular fluids after
degradation of the complex. The prognostic relevance of serum b2M has been well-established in various hematologic
malignancies, particularly CLL.7-9 We had previously assessed b2M levels in 190 untreated early stage CLL patients,
and noted shorter median OS for b2M  2 mg/dL (75 versus 115þ months, P ¼ .02). This indicated that serum b2M
levels  2 mg/dL could be used to identify a subset of early stage CLL with a shorter median survival that could potentially
benefit from early intervention.

Rituximab in Untreated Early Stage CLL/Ferrajoli et al

Rituximab is a relatively well-tolerated chimerical
monoclonal antibody directed at surface CD20 with significant activity in previously-treated indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), except for the markedly inferior
response rate of 12% in the International Working Formulation A subset (tissue equivalent of CLL).10 Overall
response (OR) rates improved to 36% with dose-escalation or to 45% with increased dose-intensity of rituximab.11-13 In patients with untreated CLL with
indications for therapy, the OR rate after 4 weeks of
standard-dose rituximab was 51% (complete [CR] rate
4%).14 Herein, we report the long-term outcomes of the
first prospective pilot study evaluating early intervention
with extended dosing single-agent standard-dose rituximab in patients with asymptomatic, early stage disease
and high b2M CLL.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients
Between March 2000 and October 2001, 34 patients with
previously untreated early stage (Rai 0-II) CLL with b2M
levels  2 mg/dL without indications for therapy per the
NCI-WG guidelines participated in this trial (Patients
characteristics are summarized in Table 1). Median age
was 66 years and median time from diagnosis to the start
of rituximab treatment was 25 months. The protocol was
approved by the Institutional Review Board at MD
Anderson Cancer Center. Informed consent for participation was obtained in accordance with institutional guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki.
Study Design
Eligibility criteria

To be eligible to participate in this study, patients
were required to have untreated CLL, Rai stage 0 to II disease, serum b2-M level of 2 mg/L or higher, without indications for treatment as per 1996 National Cancer
Institute-Working Group (NCI-WG) guidelines (4).
Other eligibility requirements were an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2, absence of active infection, and maintained organ function,
which was defined as a total bilirubin level less than 3 mg/
dL, serum hepatic transaminases less than 3 times upper
normal level, and a creatinine level less than 3 mg/dL.
Treatment

Rituximab was administered intravenously at a dose
of 375 mg/m2 once a week for 8 consecutive weeks. All

patients received single doses of dyphenidramine (25 mg)
and acetaminophen (650 mg) before rituximab administration. No antibiotic or anti-viral prophylaxis was given
during this study.
Response criteria

We used the 1996 NCI-WG guidelines for response
(4) to assess the activity of rituximab. Responses were
assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months from the start of treatment
and yearly thereafter. Toxicity reporting was determined
as per National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0).
Statistical Design
Response duration, time to disease progression, and
patient survival were calculated according to the KaplanMeier method. Median overall survival rate was estimated
by a Kaplan-Meier curve for all patients who received at
least 1 dose of rituximab, and survival duration was measured from the initiation of therapy. Progression-free survival rate was measured from the time the patient first
received rituximab to the time of disease progression, or
the date of the last clinical exam, or the date of last available data if disease progression was not documented.

Response rate was one of the end-point, and a response
rate of 40% to 50% was considered to be of interest and
warren further investigation in this patient population.
The statistical design was a two-stage design by Simon.

RESULTS
Response and toxicity data were available for the entire
patient population of 34 patients. Complete remission
(CR) was observed in 3 patients (9%), nodular partial
remission (nodular PR) in 7 patients (21%), and partial
remission (PR) in 18 patients (53%), yielding an overall
response (OR) rate of 82%. Six patients did not respond to
treatment (18%). Responses are summarized in Table 2.
The amount of residual marrow disease was quantified by immuno-flow cytometry at the time of response
evaluation in 29 patients. The neoplastic subpopulation
of cells (defined as lymphocytes with CD5/CD19 coexpression and light chain restriction) accounted for less
than 5% of the total population of analyzed cells in 5
patients and less than 1% in 2 patients (Table 2).
The median overall TTP and time to retreatment
(TTR) in the 28 responding patients were 23 and 43
months, respectively (Fig. 1). The median TTP and TTR
were longer for patients who achieved CR or nodular PR
compared with PR (40 and 63 months for CR, 27 and 56
months for nodular PR, 14 and 31 months for PR, respectively, P ¼ .03 for TTP, no statistically significant difference for TTR). The median TTP was longer for
pretreatment b2M levels below the median (3 mg/dL) (30
vs 18 months, P ¼ .02).
All but 3 patients completed the planned therapy
(treatment was discontinued for progression/lack of
response after 2, 4, and 7 weekly doses of rituximab in

each patient, respectively). Treatment related toxicity was
limited to expected mild-moderate infusional side effects.
None of the patients discontinued treatment early because
of toxicity and no infection complications were observed.
Twenty-five patients (74%) received subsequent
therapy. Twelve patients (48%) received chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) with an OR rate of 92% (CR rate 67%). Nine
patients (36%) were retreated with rituximab ( Granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor [GM-CSF])
with an OR rate of 56%. The remaining 4 patients were
treated with single agent alemtuzumab (1 patient), fludarabine (1 patient), chlorambucil (1 patient), or lenalidomide (1 patient).
The 8-year OS rate was 74%; 8 patients died (all after subsequent therapy); 4 from disease-related causes.
With median follow-up of 102 months (range, 84-120
months), the median OS was 110þ months.

DISCUSSION
In this study, a small group of asymptomatic patients with
Rai stage 0 to II CLL and elevated serum b2M level ( 2
mg/dL) were treated with standard-dose rituximab for 8
consecutive weeks. Use of b2M as the prognostic feature
to guide selection for early intervention was based on our
prior retrospective data analysis which showed higher
baseline levels were predictive of shorter survival in this
group of patients, and potential application to clinical
practice with availability of rapid standardized assays for
b2M measurement. Subsequently to the conduction of

this trial, the large prospective randomized CLL4 trial of
initial therapy for CLL confirmed that higher pretreatment b2M levels (> twice the upper level of normal) were
associated with shorter TTP and OS irrespective of treatment assignment supporting the relevance of b2M levels
as prognostic indicators.15 Furthermore, this study was
designed in 1999 when the prognostic relevance of
genomic aberrations (as evidenced by fluorescent in situ
hybridization [FISH] analysis), IgVH mutation status,
and expression of ZAP-70 had not been yet reported. The
beta2M levels, instead had been available at our center for
years allowing us to review the survival expectations based
on this marker.
In these patients without indications for chemotherapy, immunotherapy was believed to be an appropriate
intervention owing to the activity of rituximab in
untreated indolent NHL and the favorable toxicity profile
unlikely to promote resistance to subsequent therapy or to
affect hematopoietic stem cells. An extended dosing
schedule was selected to potentially increase efficacy.
The OR rate observed in this study is comparable to
the French early intervention experience (86% for daily
chlorambucil; 69% for chlorambucil/prednisone). Flow
cytometric quantitation of residual disease in the bone
marrow suggested that even single-agent therapy with rituximab could induce significant reduction in disease burden. The overall TTR was shorter than the 63 months
reported with chlorambucil in the French randomized trials, but this parameter is influenced by frequency of monitoring, subjective interpretations of ‘‘active’’ disease, and
potential for retreatment with rituximab (or other targeted agents) in situations not mandating definitive
chemotherapy.
At the time of this report, the median OS is 110þ
months and this compared favorably with our previous
experience (median OS, 75 months) for age-matched
patients with asymptomatic early stage CLL and elevated
b2M who did not undergo early intervention.
A more recent study was reported by Zent et al with
combined treatment with rituximab and alemtuzumab in
30 patients with CLL and without standard indications
for treatment, but at least 1 high risk feature (17p del, 11q
del or unmutated IgvH concomitantly with the presence
of expression of ZAP-70 or CD-38). In this trial, the OR
rate (90%) and CR rate (37%) associated with both antibodies used in combination was higher than those
observed in our study. However, duration of response and
TTR appeared shorter than our single agent rituximab experience with a median duration of response of 14 months

and a median TTP of 12.5 months. This approach was
also associated with a rate of CMV reactivation of 10%
and an occurrence of neutropenia of 17%. However, the
results of these 2 clinical trials cannot be directly compared in view of the differences in patient selection (higher
risk patients in the population studied by Zent et al) and
therapy (inclusion of alemtuzumab).
Other ongoing early intervention trials are using fludarabine, rituximab with alemtuzumab, lenalidomide, or
other agents (eg, omega-3, GM-CSF) for high-risk CLL
as defined by adverse genomic abnormalities (17p or 11q
deletions) or unmutated IgvH.
In our experience, early therapy with rituximab did
not significantly compromised efficacy of subsequent rituximab-based therapy. The CR rate in the small subset
that underwent subsequent treatment with FCR more
closely resembled the results in therapy-naive CLL as
opposed to the salvage experience.16-18
In conclusion, the results of our study indicate that
early treatment with rituximab is well tolerated and safe.
Larger studies will need to be conducted to evaluate
whether there is a survival benefit to early intervention
with rituximab, and to assess the cost-effectiveness of this
approach, which currently remains investigational in
nature.
