Abstract
CD133þ cancer stem cells (CSC) contribute to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression and resistance
to therapy. Bone morphogenetic protein BMP4 plays an important role in hepatogenesis and hepatic stem cell
differentiation, but little is known about its function in hepatic CSCs. In this study, we showed that high-dose
exogenous BMP4 promotes CD133þ HCC CSC differentiation and inhibits the self-renewal, chemotherapeutic
resistance, and tumorigenic capacity of these cells. Interestingly, we found that low-dose exogenous BMP4
upregulated CD133 protein expression in vitro, and endogenous BMP4 was preferentially expressed in CD133þ
HCC CSCs, suggesting that low doses of BMP4 may facilitate CSC maintenance. A reduction in endogenous
BMP4 levels decreased CD133 protein expression in vitro. In HCC tissues, expression of the BMP4 signaling
target gene SMAD6 was positively correlated with CD133 expression. Activation of the Erk1/2 signaling
pathway led to BMP4-mediated reduction in CD133 expression, which was reversed by treatment with MEK
inhibitors. Taken together, our ﬁndings indicated that BMP4 might be a potent therapeutic agent in HCC that
targets CSCs. Cancer Res; 72(16); 4276–85. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Although surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy all result in
reducing the bulk of the tumor mass, tumor recurrence and
metastases are still universal (1). Recently, cancer progression
has been thought to be driven by cancer stem cells (CSC),
which have the ability to self-renew, show therapeutic resistance, and give rise to relatively differentiated cells (2). In
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), several markers, such as
EpCAM, OV6, CD90, CD24, and a side population fraction
have been identiﬁed for the enrichment of hepatic CSCs (3–
8). In our previous studies, we have shown that CD133þ CSCs
in HCC cell lines were distinctive for their high clonogenicity
in vitro and high tumorigenicity in an immunodeﬁcient
mouse xenograft model. In addition, this cell population

could be further characterized by the coexpression of CD133
and CD44 (9, 10). The CD133þ CSCs in HCC exhibited a
preferential expression of stem cell–related genes and were
more resistant to chemotherapeutic agents as a result of the
upregulation of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily
transporters.
Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) have been linked to
several aspects of embryonic liver development (11). BMPs are
a subgroup of the TGF-b superfamily members, which elicit
their cellular effects via speciﬁc membrane receptors. Different
combinations of type II receptors (BMPRII) with type I receptors (BMPR1A or BMPR1B) determine the speciﬁcity for the
ligands eliciting different biologic processes (12). The activated
BMPRI phosphorylates receptor-regulated SMAD1/5/8 proteins, which can assemble into heteromeric complexes with
SMAD4 and subsequently translocate into the nucleus to
regulate the transcription of target genes (13). SMAD6 is one
of the inhibitory SMADs, and its expression is induced by BMPactivated SMAD1/5/8, creating a negative feedback loop that
interferes with BMP signaling (14).
BMP signaling has been shown to promote CSCs differentiation in the brain and colon and to facilitate brain or colon
xenograft tumor eradication (15, 16). Therefore, BMPs have
been proposed as a treatment option for glioblastoma and
colorectal tumors. Here, we show that high-dose exogenous
BMP4 exhibited potent differentiation therapy activity against
CSCs in HCC; however, low-dose or endogenous BMP4 contributed to promote CD133 protein expression. Endogenous
BMP signaling target gene, SMAD6 protein expression is
positively correlated to CD133 protein expression in HCC.
We also found that BMP4 could induce Erk1/2 activation in

a time- and dose-dependent manner, and short-term exposure
to high-level Erk1/2 phosphorylation is sufﬁcient for BMP4dependent CD133 expression reduction.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
PLC/PRF/5 was obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection; Huh7 was obtained from the Riken Cell Bank;
SMMC-7721 was provided by the Cell Bank of the Institute of
Biochemistry and Cell Biology, China Academy of Sciences
(Shanghai, China). MHCC-97L was provided from the Liver
Cancer Institute of Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University
(Shanghai, China). All cell lines used in this study were cultured
in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (DMEM; SigmaAldrich) containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS (HyClone) and
incubated at 37 C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere with 5% CO2.
For differentiation-inducing experiments of CSCs in vitro, HCC
cells were plated onto general 6-well plates (NUNC) in a
monolayer culture with serum-free chemically deﬁned medium (CDM; ref. 17). For BMP4 treatment, different amounts of
BMP4 were added to the CDM to reach the indicated ﬁnal
concentration.
The CDM consisted of a 1:1 mixture of neurobasal medium
and DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 0.5 N2, 0.5
B27 supplements, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 2 mmol/L
glutamine, and 0.1 mmol/L 2-mercaptoethanol, growth factors
including 10 ng/mL BMP4 (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 ng/mL basic
ﬁbroblast growth factor (Millipore), 10 ng/mL EGF (Millipore),
20 ng/mL hepatocyte growth factor (Millipore), 20 ng/mL
TGFa (Millipore), and 107 mol/L dexamethasone (SigmaAldrich) were added. The agents with no special indication
were purchased from the Invitrogen Corporation.
Cell isolation by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting or
magnetic activated cell sorting
For PLC/PRF/5 and Huh7, cells were labeled directly with
PE-conjugated anti-human CD133/1 antibody (AC133; Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's instruction and
sorted by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting to obtain CD133þ
and CD133 cell subpopulations. For SMMC-7721 and MHCC97L, which only contain fewer than 1% CD133þ cells, cells were
magnetically isolated CD133þ and CD133 cells with the
corresponding antibodies using the EasySep PE Selection Kit
(StemCell Technologies), according to the manufacturer's
instructions. The purity for sorted cells was evaluated by ﬂow
cytometry, and more than 90% of cells with viability determined by the trypan blue staining were acceptable for the
following experiments.
Cell proliferation assay
Three thousand cells were plated in 96-well culture plates for
24 hours and were then treated with BMP4 at the indicated
concentrations for the indicated times. Bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdUrd) ELISA assay was carried out according to manufacturer's manual (Roche Diagnostics). Optical density (OD)
values were measured by an ELISA reader (Multiskan MK3;
Thermo Scientiﬁc) at 450 nm.

Statistical analysis
The experimental data were presented as the mean  SD
and analyzed using the Student t test. P value less than 0.05 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
High-dose exogenous BMP4 induces the reduction of
CD133 expression in HCC
Liver development is regulated by several growth factors
that may contribute to the differentiation of hepatic CSCs (18).
Here, 2 HCC cell lines, PLC/PRF/5 and Huh7, with a relatively
high percentage of CD133þ cells, were selected to further
analyze the biologic effects of growth factors on CSCs (Supplementary Fig. S1A). The stemness of the CD133þ cell population was reported in previous studies or conﬁrmed in
preliminary experiments (Supplementary Fig. S1C and D), and
the sorting purity was conﬁrmed (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Several growth factors related to liver development were
screened to treat CD133þ PLC/PRF/5 cells for 3 days, and the
percentage of CD133þ cells was determined by ﬂow cytometry
in the preliminary experiments. We found that the percentage
of CD133þ cells decreased after BMP4 treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
We then explored the effects of different doses of BMP4 on
the differentiation of CSCs. CD133þ and CD133 PLC/PRF/5
cells were cultured in a monolayer with serum-free CDM added
with different doses of BMP4 ranging from 0 to 100 ng/mL for 6
days. We found that in CD133þ cells, 30 ng/mL of BMP4 could
induce the downregulation of CD133 expression, and the
downregulation was most obvious after stimulation with
100 ng/mL BMP4 (Fig. 1A). Subsequently, we found that a
50 ng/mL dose showed a sufﬁcient reduction effect and was
selected for further investigation. The BMP4 treatment exhibited no special effect on the CD133 cell population. We
investigated the effects of BMP4 on these cell lines over time.
As shown in Fig. 1B, CD133 expression began to decrease on
day 3 in PLC/PRF/5 and reached its lowest level on day 6. A
similar result was obtained in Huh7 cells. These data indicated
that BMP4 induced CD133 depression in HCC cell lines in a
time- and dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometric analysis
also revealed that the percentage of CD133þ cells had
decreased by nearly 40% after BMP4 treatment for 6 days,
with an initial 52.1% in PLC/PRF/5 that decreased to 32.9%, and
73.0% in Huh7 that decreased to 47.5% (Fig. 1D).
To determine the effect of exogenous BMP4 on the cell
proliferation and apoptosis in HCC, we incubated the cells with
different doses of BMP4 in the media and found that although
lose-dose BMP4 (10 ng/mL) increased the cell proliferation in
PLC/PRF/5, high-dose BMP4 (50–100 ng/mL) inhibited cell
growth (Fig. 1C). The cell apoptosis was not signiﬁcantly
inﬂuenced after high-dose BMP4 treatment (Supplementary
Fig. S2B).
BMP4 could induce the differentiation of HCC CSCs
Cancer cells cultured in suspension may form spheroids that
have been shown to be an efﬁcient way to enrich CSCs. The
number and size of the spheres may reﬂect the self-renewal
capability of these cell populations (19). Here, sorted CD133þ/

of BMP4 showed different effects on PLC/PRF/5 cell proliferation. D, the ﬂow cytometric analysis revealed that the percentage of CD133þ cells is reduced
after BMP4 treatment.

PLC/PRF/5 cells were cultured in suspension with serum-free
medium CDM to maintain stemness or in monolayers with the
addition of BMP4 to induce differentiation. HCC cell spheres
were obtained by growing undifferentiated cells in the CDM,
suggesting that they maintained the capacity for self-renewal
in vitro (data not shown). Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR
analysis showed that the expression of stem cell–associated
genes, including Oct4, Tert, Bmi1, b-catenin, ABCG2, and
tumor sphere–related gene Ep300 (4), in CD133þ cells were
reduced following BMP4 treatment, although the E-cadherin
protein coding gene CDH1 expression was not signiﬁcantly
affected. Conversely, the expression of these genes was not
affected or was only slightly reduced in CD133 cells (Fig. 2A),
indicating that BMP4 mainly targeted the CD133þ CSCs pool
of HCC.
Cytokeratin 19 (CK19) has been used as a marker for biliary
epithelial cells, and CK19 is closely correlated with the clinicopathologic features of HCC aggressiveness (20). After BMP4
treatment, PLC/PRF/5 CD133þ CSCs displayed a time-dependent downregulation of CK19 expression (Fig. 2B). CK8/18 are
hepatocyte-speciﬁc markers (21). We found that BMP4 treatment could also induce a time-dependent enhancement of
CK8/18 expression in the CD133þ CSCs (Fig. 2B). In addition,
CK19 expression in the CD133 cells was largely unaffected,

4278

Cancer Res; 72(16) August 15, 2012

whereas CK8/18 was clearly upregulated after BMP4 treatment
for 6 days. Immunoﬂuorescence staining results showed that
the number of CK19-positive cells decreased, and CK8/18positive cells increased after BMP4 treatment (Fig. 2C). These
results were conﬁrmed in Huh7 (Supplementary Fig. S2C) and
MHCC-97L (Supplementary Fig. S2D), which indicated that
high-dose exogenous BMP4 induced CD133þ PLC/PRF/5 CSC
differentiation and increased their expression of hepatocyte
lineage marker.
BMP4 inhibits the self-renewal and tumorigenic capacity
of HCC CSCs
Sorted CD133þ/ PLC/PRF/5 cells were cultured in suspension in CDM or in monolayers, and BMP4 was added to observe
their differentiation for 6 days. To evaluate the alteration of the
self-renewal capability of these cells, we ﬁrst compared their
clonogenicity by anchorage-independent growth assays in soft
agar. The results showed that the CD133þ HCC cells ﬁrst
cultured with BMP4 possessed lower colony formation efﬁciency (CFE) than that of CD133þ cells continually cultured in
CDM (Fig. 3A). However, the CFE of CD133 HCC cells was not
signiﬁcantly affected by BMP4 treatment. We further tested the
sphere-formation ability of CD133þ cells with or without BMP4
treatments. As shown in Fig. 3B, the tumor spheres obtained

from treated CD133þ cells were fewer in number and smaller
than those of CD133þ cells continually cultured in CDM. These
results indicated that the self-renewal capability of CD133þ
HCC CSCs was impaired after differentiation.
The tumorigenicity of CD133þ/ cells with and without
BMP4 treatment was analyzed in an immunodeﬁcient mouse
xenograft model. The orthotopical inoculation of freshly sorted
CD133þ/ PLC/PRF/5 cells was accompanied by the coinjection of vehicle (control)- or BMP4-saturated polyacrylic beads
[releasing BMP4 for 1 week (16)] at the time of cell implantation. And to ensure the xenograft tumors generation, large
cell number was used. In these experiments, 5 of 6 animals that
received CD133þ PLC/PRF/5 cells with control beads developed large tumors (Fig. 3C), whereas the mice bearing CD133þ
cells with BMP4-releasing beads did not form visible tumors
(Supplementary Fig. S3A and D). Although CD133 PLC/PRF/5
cells formed fewer (3 of 6 mice) and smaller tumors than
CD133þ cells (Fig. 3D), the tumorigenicity was not greatly
affected by BMP4 cotransplantation (2 of 6 mice). Similar
results were obtained with the MHCC-97L cell line, which
exhibited a low percentage of CD133þ cells (Fig. 3C and D, and
Supplementary Fig. S3B). Thus, BMP4 also possessed antitumor effects in vivo, suggesting that BMP4 might be a useful
component of the differentiation therapy for HCC.

BMP4 enhances the sensitivity of HCC CSCs to
chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro
Another important property of CSC is their resistance to
chemotherapeutic agents. In this study, 2 structurally and
functionally unrelated drugs, doxorubicin and vincristine, were
used to evaluate the drug resistance attributes of BMP4-treated
and untreated HCC cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, CD133þ PLC/
PRF/5 cells showed marked increases in their resistance to
doxorubicin or vincristine compared with CD133 cells, and
BMP4 treatment consistently increased their sensitivity to
these 2 agents.
On the basis of our previous ﬁndings that HCC CSCs were
more resistant to chemotherapeutic agents as a result of the
upregulation of the superfamily of ABC transporters, we analyzed ABCG2 expression in PLC/PRF/5. We found clear reductions in ABCG2 expression after BMP4 treatment (Fig. 4B). In
HCC, the expression and functional status of ABCG2 is
reported to be closely associated with the side population, a
minor subset of cells with the unique capacity to extrude
Hoechst 33342 (22). However, few side population cells could
be detected in PLC/PRF/5 (unpublished data), we detected the
alteration of the side population proportion in MHCC-97L
cells. We found that ABCG2 expression was depressed in sorted
or unsorted MHCC-97L cells after BMP4 treatment (Fig. 4C). As

shown in Fig. 4D, the side population proportion was
decreased from 5.1% to 2.3% after BMP4 induction, suggesting
that BMP4 may also possess a prodifferentiation effect on the
side population population in HCC.
Exogenous BMP4 induces the activation of the canonical
BMP/SMAD signaling pathway in HCC
To investigate the effect of canonical BMP signaling in
BMP4-induced differentiation, we ﬁrst examined the activation of the BMP4 signaling pathway. Nearly all of the HCC cell
lines analyzed were found to express BMPRIa and BMPRIb
proteins (Fig. 5A, Supplementary Fig. S4A) by Western blot, and
in human primary HCC tissues, the positive staining of BMPRIa
and BMPRIb proteins was 70% (165 of 236) and 57% (134 of
236), respectively, by immunohistochemical assay (Fig. 5B).
Chiu and colleagues reported that BMPRIa is overexpressed in
HCC and BMPRIa knockdown HCC cells were less tumorigenic
(23), though we found that BMPRIa expression showed no
difference between CD133þ and CD133 cells (Fig. 5C).
After BMP4 treatment, different HCC cells showed constitutively active BMP/SMAD canonical signaling, as revealed

4280

by the high levels of both pSMAD1/5/8 and SMAD4 intermediate molecules. Furthermore, SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation
induced by BMP4 is time dependent (Fig. 5A, Supplementary
Fig. S4B). We also observed that SMAD6 overexpression was
induced by BMP4 treatment in SMMC-7721 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4A).
In many cases, the heterotetramer SMAD1/5/8-SMAD4
complex is required for BMPs signaling. siRNA oligonucleotides speciﬁcally targeting SMAD4 were synthesized, and the
knockdown efﬁciency was conﬁrmed (Supplementary Fig.
S4C). As shown in Fig. 5D, the downregulation of CD133 protein
expression induced by BMP4 treatment was attenuated after
SMAD4 knockdown, which showed that the BMP4 prodifferentiation effect was a consequence of its canonical signaling
activation.
Endogenous BMP4 inversely contributes to CD133
expression in HCC
Because the hepatic progenitor expansion medium (CDM)
also contains a low concentration of BMP4, we explored the
effects of different doses, especially low-dose BMP4 on CSC

differentiation. As shown in Fig. 1A, compared with low-dose
BMP4 groups (2.5–10 ng/mL), CD133 expression was also
downregulated with no exogenous BMP4 present in vitro.
Endogenous BMP4 mRNA and protein were preferentially
expressed in CD133þ CSCs in HCC cell lines (Fig. 6A) and in 2
primary cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S5A). As BMP4 is a
secretary growth factor (24), secretary BMP4 in the culture
supernatant was also analyzed; the results showed that the
quantiﬁcation of BMP4 was at a higher level in the CD133þ
CSCs culture supernatant than in their CD133 counterparts
(Supplementary Fig. S5B). Knockdown of BMP4 expression
lead to downregulation of CD133 and CK19 protein expression
in PLC/PRF/5, but increased CK8/18 expression (Fig. 6B and
C). These data suggested that although high-dose exogenous
BMP4 possessed prodifferentiation effects on CD133þ CSCs,
low-dose exogenous or endogenous BMP4 might contribute to
CD133þ CSCs maintenance.
The protein expression of SMAD6, a BMP4 target gene, was
detected in HCC tissue samples and adjacent noncancerous
tissue samples by Western blot. Of the 28 pairs of HCC samples
detected, SMAD6 expression was found to be upregulated in 22
cases in tumor tissues, indicating that BMP4 signaling is active
in most hepatic cancer tissues (Supplementary Fig. S5C and D).
By immunohistochemical analysis, we found positive and
diffused staining of SMAD6 in 62% (146 of 236) of HCC samples,
and its expression positively correlated with CD133 expression
(Fig. 6D). We also found that SMAD6 was differentially
expressed in HCC cell lines and overexpressed in CD133þ
CSCs compared with the corresponding CD133 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5E and F). The knockdown of SMAD6 expres-

sion by siRNA could lead to a CD133 expression reduction
(Supplementary Fig. S5G and H), which suggested that SMAD6
may contribute to the regulation of CD133 expression.
Transient Erk1/2 phosphorylation facilitates the BMP4induced CD133 depression
Recent reports showed that SMAD and mitogen-activated
protein kinase pathways communicate through signaling
cross-talk (25). In this experiment, we found that BMP4 could
induce Erk1/2 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 7A). Furthermore, when we incubated cells with a particular concentration of BMP4 for different periods of time,
Erk1/2 phosphorylation reached a peak at approximately 30
minutes, whereas at 5 minutes, Erk1/2 phosphorylation
attained nearly a maximum concentration (Fig. 7B).
To further ascertain the relationship between CD133 expression and Erk1/2 phosphorylation, HCC cells were incubated
with the mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal–regulated kinase (MEK) inhibitors PD98059 and U0126. Treatment
with either of the MEK inhibitors for 3 days induced the
inhibition of Erk1/2 phosphorylation, which promoted CD133
protein expression (Fig. 7C). Continuous treatment with either
MEK inhibitor nearly abolished the BMP4-induced CD133
depression (Fig. 7D). However, when the inhibitors were added
24 hours after the BMP4 treatment, the CD133 expression was
still reduced (Fig. 7D), indicating that a short-term exposure to
a high level of Erk1/2 phosphorylation plays a very important
role in the BMP4-induced reduction of CD133 protein expression. However, after long-term (6 days) treatment of BMP4,
Erk1/2 phosphorylation was inhibited in a dose-dependent

manner in HCC cell lines, and the phosphorylation level of
Erk1/2 was upregulated in CD133þ HCC cells (Supplementary
Fig. S6A and B). Considering that cell growth was repressed
after treatment with high-dose exogenous BMP4 or MEK
inhibitors, we speculated that an adequate level of Erk1/2
phosphorylation might participate in the self-renewal of CSCs.

Discussion
CSCs are thought to be responsible for the resistance of
hepatic carcinoma to conventional therapies. Differentiation
therapy could result in a loss of the CSCs self-renewal ability
and the induction of terminal differentiation. The most successful application of differentiation therapy is the use of alltrans retinoic acid in acute premyelocytic leukemia, which is
applied as a prodifferentiation inducer to enhance the chemotherapeutic effects (26).
BMP4 plays an important role in the hepatogenesis, and
BMP4 has been shown to induce rat hepatic progenitor cell
differentiation (27). Here, we screened several growth factors
involved in hepatic development and found that BMP4 could
induce a reduction in the percentage of CD133þ CSCs. BMP
canonical signaling can be switched on by the exogenous
administration of BMP4. With a mode of action similar to
which has been reported in glioblastoma and colorectal cancer
(15, 16), high-dose exogenous BMP4 treatments could induce
the differentiation of CD133þ CSCs and simultaneously inhibit
the self-renewal, chemotherapeutic resistance, and tumorigen-

esis of these cells. And as the report in adipose-derived stem
cells (28), we found that although high-dose exogenous BMP4
reduced cell proliferation, low-dose BMP4 increased the cultured cell content and upregulated CD133 expression in HCC.
In addition, we found that endogenous BMP4 is required for
CD133þ CSCs maintenance.
The reported function of BMPs in cancers is inconsistent,
and they are described as both growth stimulators (29) and
antigrowth molecules (30). The mechanism of action of BMPs
may be different at the molecular level in different cancerous
environments (31). In hepatocellular carcinoma, Maegdefrau
and colleagues reported that BMP4 expression increased in
HCC samples and BMP4 suppression resulted in a strong
reduction of migratory and invasive potential (32, 33). Chiu
and colleagues reported that BMP4 and its receptor, BMPRIa
are overexpressed in HCC, and it promotes the growth and
migration (23). Guo and colleagues reported that BMP4 might
be a marker for predicting the prognosis of HCC patients (34).
We found that both BMP4 and SMAD6 were overexpressed in
CD133þ CSCs, and the secretary BMP4 was also at a higher
lever in the CD133þ CSCs culture supernatant, suggesting
that BMP signaling may be constitutively activated by endogenous BMP4 in CSCs and in HCC in an autocrine or a
paracrine way, which may aid in maintaining their CD133
expression. However, BMPRIa expression showed no difference between CD133þ/CD133 cells. We also found that
SMAD6 expression positively correlates with CD133 in HCC

samples, and SMAD6 knockdown led to CD133 protein
expression depression, indicating that SMAD6 may contribute
to the CD133 expression regulation in HCC. Although SMAD6
was reported as a predictor of overall survival in oral squamous cell carcinoma (35), our results did not identify correlation between SMAD6 expression and clinical features in
HCC tissues (data not shown). The relationship between
SMAD6 and CSC differentiation needs to be further
investigated.
Erks are involved in a variety of cellular processes, but the
effects of Erk signaling in stem cells are contradictory. For
example, blocking Erk1/2 signaling through treatment with a
MEK inhibitor promotes the growth of undifferentiated mouse
embryonic stem cells (ESC; ref. 36). In contrast, Li and colleagues reported that high basal MEK/ERK activity was required
for maintaining human ESCs in an undifferentiated state (37).
In HCC, the constitutive activation of Erk1/2 has been shown to
be required for cancer cell proliferation and invasion. And Ding
and colleagues report that CD133þ HCC cells show a substantial increase in Erk1/2 signaling activation (38). Our results
showed that short-term treatment with BMP4 could induce
Erk1/2 activation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In
addition, the inhibition of Erk1/2 phosphorylation by a MEK1/
2 inhibitor may lead to CD133 protein overexpression in HCC
cell lines, which is distinct from the observation of CSCs in
colon carcinoma (39). The MEK inhibitor nearly abolished the
CD133 expression reduction resulting from the BMP4 treat-

ment, and a short-term exposure to a high level of Erk1/2
phosphorylation plays an important role in BMP4 prodifferentiation effects. These data showed that Erk signaling functions as an alternative pathway for BMP4-dependent CD133
repression.
The cross-talk between BMP/SMAD and Erk signaling has
been reported in many cell types (40, 41). In human umbilical
vein endothelial cells, Erk is essential for efﬁcient transduction
of BMP signals and serves as a positive feedback mechanism in
capillary sprouting, and stimulation of SMAD6 inhibits Erk
activation and thus results in a negative feedback loop to ﬁnetune BMP signaling (42). However, the Erk pathway has been
variably reported to enhance or inhibit SMAD activity (40). On
the basis of our results, we speculate that high level of Erk
phosphorylation may enhance the effect of BMP canonical
pathway on the depression of CD133 expression in CSCs, and
SMAD6 might function as a feedback inhibitor for them,
though the relationship between them need to be veriﬁed in
our future work.
Moreover, we ﬁnd that after long-term BMP4 treatments,
CD133þ/ PLC/PRF/5 cells displayed a dose-dependent
reduction of Erk1/2 phosphorylation. The Erk1/2 phosphorylation level increased in CD133þ CSCs, which is coincident
with the expression phenotype of BMP4 in CD133þ and
CD133 HCC cells. Considering that cell growth was repressed
after treatment with high-dose BMP4 and MEK inhibitors, we
speculated that a required level of Erk1/2 phosphorylation

might participate in CSC self-renewal. Thus, endogenous
BMP4 may serve to regulate the balance between the selfrenewal and differentiation of CD133þ HCC CSCs through
MEK/ERK signaling. A similar phenomenon was reported and
analyzed in ESCs. Li and colleagues found that low-dose
exogenous BMP4 could steadily attenuate ERK activity by
upregulating ERK-speciﬁc DUSP9 and, meanwhile, BMP signaling reinforces the self-renewal status of ESCs together with
LIF (43).
In conclusion, BMP4 signaling plays a critical role in CSCs in
HCC. Although high-dose exogenous BMP4 promotes differentiation of CSCs, low-dose or endogenous BMP4, in contrast,
may contribute to CSCs maintenance. Therefore, further evaluation is necessary to determine the clinical safety and usefulness of BMP4 as an agent in the differentiation therapy of
HCC.
