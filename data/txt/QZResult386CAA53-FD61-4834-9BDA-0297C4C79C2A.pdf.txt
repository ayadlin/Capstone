Abstract
Standardized and reproducible preclinical models that recapitulate the dynamics of prostate cancer are
urgently needed. We established a bank of transplantable patient-derived prostate cancer xenografts that capture
the biologic and molecular heterogeneity currently confounding prognostication and therapy development.
Xenografts preserved the histopathology, genome architecture, and global gene expression of donor tumors.
Moreover, their aggressiveness matched patient observations, and their response to androgen withdrawal
correlated with tumor subtype. The panel includes the ﬁrst xenografts generated from needle biopsy tissue
obtained at diagnosis. This advance was exploited to generate independent xenografts from different sites of a
primary site, enabling functional dissection of tumor heterogeneity. Prolonged exposure of adenocarcinoma
xenografts to androgen withdrawal led to castration-resistant prostate cancer, including the ﬁrst-in-ﬁeld model of
complete transdifferentiation into lethal neuroendocrine prostate cancer. Further analysis of this model supports
the hypothesis that neuroendocrine prostate cancer can evolve directly from adenocarcinoma via an adaptive
response and yielded a set of genes potentially involved in neuroendocrine transdifferentiation. We predict that
these next-generation models will be transformative for advancing mechanistic understanding of disease
progression, response to therapy, and personalized oncology. Cancer Res; 74(4); 1272–83. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Globally, prostate cancer is the second most commonly
diagnosed cancer in men and accounts for 250,000 deaths
annually (1). Although androgen deprivation therapy elicits
rapid remission, tumors inevitably return as castrate-resistant
prostate cancer (CRPC), which often remains androgen-dependent and is essentially untreatable (2). The development of
novel therapeutics has been hampered in part through high
clinical and biologic heterogeneity and the lack of distinguishable histologic subtypes. However, the age of next-generation
sequencing and integrated genomics is providing increasing

evidence for molecularly deﬁned subtypes. Although strict
correlation with clinical outcome remains elusive, tumors can
now be classiﬁed by their genome copy number, fusion gene
proﬁles, mutational landscapes, and even mRNA splicing
patterns (3–7). To exploit emergent discoveries for mechanistic understanding and therapeutic advances, focus must now
turn to the development of a new generation of preclinical
models that capture the "omic" diversity of prostate cancer.
Preclinical cancer models for in vivo drug tests are commonly
based on immune-deﬁcient mice carrying subcutaneous prostate cancer cell line xenografts. Unfortunately, these models fail
to reproduce the diverse heterogeneity observed in the clinic,
partly due to the increased homogeneity of established cell lines
after long-term in vitro culturing. Furthermore, cell line xenografts rarely possess the tissue architecture of the original
cancer specimens from which the cell lines were derived and,
consequently, do not accurately represent the complex biochemical and physical interactions between the cancer cells and
various components of their microenvironment as found in the
original malignancies. Unsurprisingly, therefore, cell line xenografts frequently fail to adequately predict the efﬁcacy of
anticancer agents in the clinic (8). Thus, only approximately
5% of potential new anticancer drugs, which have successfully
passed in vivo tests, have signiﬁcant efﬁcacy in clinical trials and
are approved for clinical usage by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (9). The cost of these failures is estimated in the
range of hundreds of millions of dollars per drug (10).

Next-Generation Models of Prostate Cancer

In theory, patient-derived cancer tissue xenograft models,
based on direct implantation of fresh cancer tissue specimens
into immunodeﬁcient mice [e.g., nude, SCID (severe combined
immunodeﬁcient) mice], provide the needed clinical relevance.
In other cancers, these xenografts retain the cellular heterogeneity, architectural and molecular characteristics of the
original cancer, and its microenvironment (11). However,
development of prostate cancer tissue xenograft models has
been hampered by low success rates, partly due to poor
vascularization of the graft site, with engraftment only successful when applied to advanced cancers with high growth
rates (e.g., metastatic tumors; refs. 12–14). As such, existing
models represent only a small proportion of cancer phenotypes
and do not recapitulate disease heterogeneity (15, 16).
In contrast with the subcutaneous graft site, the subrenal
capsule (SRC) site is highly vascularized and associated with a
very high take rate for most intact grafted tissues, including
benign human prostate tissue (17, 18). Recently, Lawrence and
colleagues have also standardized a protocol for subrenal
grafting of recombined localized human prostate epithelial
tissue with mouse mesenchyme (19). They demonstrate the
remarkable effectiveness of the subrenal site for modeling
localized prostate tumors (20). Over the past few years, we
have established a novel panel of transplantable patientderived prostate tumor xenograft models, the Living Tumor
Laboratory (LTL) series, from intact primary and metastatic
clinical specimens via SRC grafting. Our xenografts retain the
histopathologic and molecular characteristics of their original
parent tumors and represent several recently emerging molecular subtypes of prostate cancer. Therefore, we present a panel
of high-ﬁdelity primary and metastatic prostate cancer models,
which accurately recapitulate biologic and molecular heterogeneity. This publicly available resource provides the urgently
needed tools to advance mechanistic understanding of disease
progression and response to therapy, and delivers clinically
relevant model systems for evaluation of preclinical drug
efﬁcacy and beyond.

Materials and Methods
Materials and animals
Chemicals, stains, solvents, and solutions were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich Canada Ltd., unless otherwise indicated.
Nonobese diabetic (NOD)/SCID mice (NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J)
were originally purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and
were bred in the breeding area of speciﬁc pathogen–free (SPF)
level facility in the Animal Resource Center (ARC), BC Cancer
Research Centre. The breeding colonies were managed by the
ARC staff and delivered to experimental housing room after
being weaned. The mice used for xenografts were 6-to 8-weeks
old. All food, water, and litter were sterilized before use.
Temperature (20 C–21 C) and humidity (50%–60%) were controlled. Daily light cycles were 12-hour light and 12-hour dark.
Cages were changed fully once or twice a week.
Prostate cancer tissue acquisition
Specimens were obtained from patients following a protocol
approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Board of the University of British Columbia (UBC) and the BC Cancer Agency

www.aacrjournals.org

(BCCA). The specimens were examined, sectioned, and selected by pathologists for histologic analysis and xenografting. All
patients signed a consent form approved by the Ethics Board
(UBC Ethics Board #: H09-01628 and H04-60131; VCHRI #: V090320 and V07-0058).
SRC grafting and development of transplantable tumor
lines
Within 24 hours of sample arrival, a minor portion of the
tumor was ﬁxed for histologic analysis. The remainder of the
tumors were cut into small pieces (1  3  3 mm3 in size) and
grafted into the SRC of male NOD/SCID mice supplemented
with testosterone as previously described (18). After 3 to 6
months of growth (or earlier if required by the health status of
the hosts), the animals were sacriﬁced in a CO2 chamber for
necropsy. Tumors were harvested and regrafted into NOD/
SCID mice under the kidney capsules. The rapidly growing
tumors (transplantable tumor lines) were consistently maintained by serial SRC transplantation. Static xenograft pieces
were maintained by serial transplantation for up to 3 years. At
each passage of rapidly growing tumors and at the last passage
of static tumors, xenografts were harvested, measured, and
ﬁxed for histopathologic analysis. The hosts were sacriﬁced
and examined for metastases of human origin in lymph nodes,
lungs, livers, kidneys, spleens, and bones (femur). Animal care
and experiments were carried out in accordance with the
guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care.
Histopathology and immunohistochemistry
Preparation of parafﬁn-embedded tissue sections and
immunohistochemical analyses were carried out as previously
described (21). For histopathology, routine hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) staining was carried out. A rabbit polyclonal antiAR antibody (Afﬁnity BioReagents), rabbit polyclonal anti-PSA
antibody (Dako), rabbit monoclonal anti-PTEN antibody (Cell
Signaling Technology) and rabbit monoclonal anti-ERG antibody (Epitomics) were used for immunohistochemistry. Biotinylated anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (IgG) and peroxidaselinked avidin/biotin complex reagents were obtained from
Vector Laboratories. Control sections were processed in parallel with rabbit nonimmune IgG (Dako) used at the same
concentrations as the primary antibodies.
Copy number and gene expression analysis
For DNA and RNA isolation, patient and xenograft tumor
sections were processed as previously described (22). We performed genome copy-number proﬁling using the Agilent SurePrint G3 Human CGH 4  180K and 8  60K Microarray
platforms. Of note, 0.5 mg of genomic DNA was used for
hybridization, according to the manufacturer's standard protocols as previously described (7, 22). Limited sample availability
of patient samples 972 and 1,005 prevented array comparative
genomic hybridization (aCGH) analysis. Instead, from these 2
patients, we used DNA-Seq–derived copy-number proﬁles,
which were published previously (7). All copy-number proﬁles
were visualized and analyzed using the Biodiscovery Nexus Copy
Number software package v6.0. The hierarchical clustering used
complete linkage and a Euclidean distance metric.

For gene expression, total RNA samples were prepared
following Agilent's One-Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression Analysis Low Input Quick Amp Labeling v6.0. An input of
100 ng of total RNA was used to generate cyanine-3–labeled
cRNA. Samples were hybridized on Agilent SurePrint G3
Human GE 8  60K Microarray (Design ID, 028004). Arrays
were scanned with the Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner at a 3mm scan resolution and data were processed with Agilent
Feature Extraction 10.10. Processed signal was quantile normalized with Agilent GeneSpring 11.5.1. Hierarchical clustering of gene expression data was performed using distance
metrics calculated from pairwise correlation coefﬁcients.
Comparisons between samples were carried out using fold
change of expression. Gene Ontology Term Enrichment was
performed using DAVID Bioinformatics Resources v6.7 (23).
aCGH copy number and microarray gene expression data are
available at GEO accession number GSE41193.
Sequence data analysis
Matched whole-genome sequencing (DNA-seq) and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) of LTL331 and LTL331R was
performed at the BCCA Michael Smith Genome Sciences
Centre according to standard protocols. For analyses of
RNA-seq data [including the neuroendocrine prostate cancers
(NEPC) clinical cohort; ref. 24], reads were ﬁrst mapped onto
the HG19 genome and exon–exon junctions by splice-aware
aligner Tophat, using the known gene model annotation from
Ensembl release 62. Reads with an unmapped mate or multimapped location were ﬁltered out using BamTools and PCR or
sequencing optical duplicates were marked and removed by
Picard. On the basis of the alignment of RNA-seq reads, gene
expression proﬁles for each sample were calculated on the
basis of the gene annotation (Ensembl release 62). Only reads
that were unique to one gene and exactly corresponded to gene
structure were assigned to the corresponding genes. Raw read
counts were normalized by R package DESeq across all samples. Adenocarcinoma samples were compared with NEPC
samples using fold change in gene expression. Fusion transcripts and associated genomic breakpoints in LTL331 and
LTL331R (Supplementary Fig. S8) were identiﬁed from RNASeq and DNA-Seq using the nFuse algorithm (25). To validate
fusion junctions, primers were designed that ﬂanked the
predicted fusion position, and PCR reactions were performed
to amplify the fusion fragments from cDNA. All ampliﬁcation
products were sequenced with ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer using standard techniques to conﬁrm identity.

Results
Generation and maintenance of transplantable patientderived tumor lines
Directly after surgery or biopsy, fresh primary or metastatic
prostate cancer samples from 18 patients (collected February
2008 to May 2010) were transplanted into the SRC of male
NOD/SCID mice supplemented with testosterone. Tumors
from 2 of 18 patients were terminated because of development
of B-cell lymphoma (26), whereas 9 of 16 were viable but static
for >2 years after grafting. However, tumors from 7 of 18
patients, including ﬁve needle biopsy samples from 1 patient,

1274

Cancer Res; 74(4) February 15, 2014

showed robust growth after an initial latency period (time from
initial engraftment until tumor volume reaches 100 mm3)
ranging from 3 to 37 months (median, 22 months; Table 1).
From these 7 patients, we established and expanded 12 transplantable tumor lines for a minimum of ﬁve generations of
serial passaging (Table 1; Fig. 1; Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. S1;
www.livingtumorlab.com). Nine transplantable tumor lines
were developed from primary tumors (5 different patients).
Furthermore, 7 of these lines were derived from needle biopsies
(3 different patients), the ﬁrst-time needle biopsies have been
captured in a patient-derived xenograft model, and a signiﬁcant
step forward, given the critical node prostatic biopsies occupy in
clinical diagnostic decisions. Small pieces of xenograft tissue
(1 mm3) from all transplantable tumor lines were collected at
early generations (e.g., <5 generations) and frozen with dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO). These stocks are maintained in liquid nitrogen tanks as frozen seeds, and can be recovered in NOD/SCID
mice (mean recover rate using SRC grafting was 95%).
The two transplantable tumor lines with the briefest latency
before line establishment (3 and 6 months), and the fastest
tumor volume doubling time (10–12 days), were derived from
metastatic NEPC (Table 1). This is consistent with the clinic,
where NEPC is an aggressive histopathologic subtype of prostate cancer for which there is no effective therapy (27). The
remaining 10 of 12 transplantable tumor lines represent adenocarcinoma, the dominant histopathologic subtype in the
clinic (95% of diagnoses). In adenocarcinoma lines, tumor
volume doubling time ranged from 10 to 23 days. Apart from
the initial latency period after patient tumor engraftment, once
lines were established, there was no latency at each generation
of serial transplantation.
Preservation of donor prostate tumor histopathology
All transplantable tumor lines retained the major histopathologic characteristics of their matched patient tumor (Table
1; Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S1). In at least three serial
generations of each adenocarcinoma line, we observed conservation of either the glandular structure or solid sheet,
depending on the differentiation status of the original patient
tumor. Furthermore, each line retained expression of markers
of prostatic adenocarcinoma, e.g., androgen receptor (AR) and
prostate-speciﬁc antigen (PSA). The two xenografts exhibited
solid sheets of round/oval tumor cells with minimal cytoplasm
and frequent mitotic ﬁgures, consistent with clinical NEPC.
The lines were negative for AR and PSA expression but positive
for the NEPC markers chromogranin A (CHGA) and synaptophysin (SYP). Accordingly, PSA was undetectable in the serum
of hosts bearing NEPC lines. In contrast, serum PSA in all
adenocarcinoma line hosts broadly corresponded to tumor
volume (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Conservation of patient tumor molecular characteristics
and prostate cancer heterogeneity
Chromosomal aberration is a sentinel feature of many
cancers, and the associated gene deregulation and genome
instability is implicated in the development and progression of
prostate cancer (5, 6, 28–30). Combined genome copy-number
analysis of each independent transplantable tumor line

demonstrated that they recapitulate both the heterogeneity of
prostate cancer and key chromosomal alterations frequently
observed (Fig. 3A; refs. 6, 31). For example, in agreement with
published patient tumor cohorts, we observed frequent loss of
8p and key tumor suppressors such as TP53, NKX3-1, and RB1,
as well as gains of 8q and oncogenes such as ETV1, EZH2, and

BRAF (Fig. 3A). Six of seven independent tumor lines (11of 12
overall) showed homozygous or heterozygous loss of PTEN,
which was consistent with PTEN protein expression (Table

(3, 32–34). Transplantable tumor lines LTL310, LTL331, and
LTL313A-H were developed from TMPRSS2-ERG–positive
tumors and accordingly expressed TMPRSS2-ERG at the mRNA
level (Fig. 3E) and high levels of ERG at the protein level (Table
1; Fig. 1; Supplementary Fig. S1). NEPC lines LTL352 and LTL370
exhibited an interstitial deletion between TMPRSS2 and ERG
(Supplementary Fig. S3), but no ERG expression was detectable,
presumably because the androgen responsive gene TMPRSS2 is
no longer under transcriptional pressure. The LTL418 tumor
line was TMPRSS2-ERG negative, but exhibited high expression
of ETV1 (Fig. 3E), potentially indicating an ETV1 rearrangement.
After ERG, ETV1 is the most common overexpressed ETS gene
in prostate tumors. LTL412 and LTL311 were apparently ETS
fusion negative. LTL412 was developed from a metastatic
tumor, treated for 5 years with antiandrogen therapy, and
exhibited clear signs of response to therapy, including expression of constitutive active forms of the AR (7).
Aware of the potential for transplantable tumor lines to
evolve after serial passaging in mice and diverge from the
original molecular characteristics, we compared copy number
and gene expression proﬁles of late generations with those of
the early generations (Supplementary Figs. S4 and S5). After

1278

Cancer Res; 74(4) February 15, 2014

serial passaging, only minimal changes were observed in gross
genome copy number. Nevertheless, the preservation of early
generations as frozen stock means any divergence can be
circumvented if necessary.
Different biopsy foci recapitulate functional
heterogeneity
Five of the transplantable tumor lines (LTL313A-H) were
derived from needle biopsy specimens from ﬁve different foci of
a patient's primary tumor (Fig. 4). The slow-to-develop nature of
prostate cancer means that at diagnosis a prostate can frequently be colonized by multiple subpopulations of cancer cells,
each with potentially different aggressiveness. Understanding
this heterogeneity molecularly is of fundamental importance, as
critical diagnostic decisions and prognostic predictions are
heavily inﬂuenced by biopsy. Interestingly, the LTL-313 tumor
lines showed different metastatic ability and growth rates in
vivo (Fig. 4A and B). For example, mice harboring LTL313H
reproducibly developed microscopic metastases in the lung (29
of 34 mice), whereas LTL313B exhibited very low metastatic
potential (1 of 11 LTL313B mice developed metastases). Copynumber proﬁling revealed that all ﬁve lines shared major

chromosomal alterations, e.g., PTEN deletion and TMPRSS2ERG interstitial deletion, and exhibited a broadly similar pattern
of aberration, suggesting all lines share a common ancestor (Fig.
4B and C; Table 1). However, several unique chromosomal
alterations were only observed in particular tumor lines, including for example, deletion of BRCA2 and RB1 in LTL313H (Fig.
4C). Therefore, despite the likely monoclonal origin of each
biopsy foci, during the colonization of the prostate by the
predominant clone, individual populations diverged, creating
a series of functionally heterogeneous subpopulations, which
are represented by LTL313A-H.
Response to androgen deprivation is consistent with the
clinic and leads to the development of CRPC
Because androgen deprivation can lead to CRPC in patients,
we examined the response of tumor lines to host castration and
bicalutamide treatment (a front-line therapy in the clinic).

Host castration resulted initially in a dramatic drop in tumor
volume and PSA levels of all adenocarcinoma line hosts,
whereas NEPC lines continued to grow in the absence of
androgen (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Bicalutamide treatment
also resulted in a drop of tumor volume in all adenocarcinoma
lines tested; a clinically relevant ﬁnding, given almost all
patients respond initially to this therapy (Supplementary Fig.
S2B; Supplementary Table S1). In LTL313B and LTL331, we
observed reproducible castrate-resistant growth (LTL313BR
and LTL331R) after several months postcastration (Fig. 5A–C;
Supplementary Fig. S6). LTL313BR retained protein expression
of AR and PSA, therefore representing the majority of clinical
cases in which CRPC remains dependent on AR signaling.
However, androgen deprivation can also lead to the development of NEPC; it is estimated that up to 100% of CRPCs have a
NEPC component (35). Although, histologically and molecularly, LTL331 is a typical adenocarcinoma, LTL331R was

entirely AR- and PSA-negative and uniformly expressed a range
of neuroendocrine markers including SYP, CHGA, CHGB, and
CD56 (Fig. 3E; Fig. 5A; Supplementary Fig. S6). LTL331R
retained its neuroendocrine phenotype and androgen-independent growth when regrafted into either intact, testosterone-supplemented or castrated hosts, which suggested a stable
and irreversible transformation (Supplementary Fig. S6). We
performed RNA and DNA sequencing of LTL331 and LTL331R.
At the gene expression level, LTL331R was highly similar to
clinical NEPC tumors, with upregulated genes, including a
broad spectrum of neuronal transcription factors, membrane
ion channels, receptors, and secreted peptides (Supplementary
Fig. S7). Both LTL331 and LTL331R exhibited very similar copynumber proﬁles (Fig. 5C), and all fusion genes expressed in
LTL331 were also identiﬁed in LTL331R, with the exception of
TMPRSS2-ERG (lost due to the absence of AR expression;
Supplementary Fig. S8). These data, together with the absence
of NEPC cells in LTL331 precastration (Supplementary Fig. S8),
indicate an adaptive response of the major population of
adenocarcinoma cells rather than clonal selection of existing
NEPC cells. The transformation seems to represent neuroendocrine transdifferentiation, in which NEPC evolves directly
from adenocarcinoma cells (36, 37).
Hypothesizing that LTL331 may be "predisposed" to transdifferentiate, we identiﬁed 549 upregulated and 362 downregulated genes in our microarray data whose expression were
altered in LTL331 relative to other adenocarcinoma xenografts
and concomitantly altered in the same direction in the NEPC
LTL331R (Fig. 5D; Supplementary Fig. S9). We compared this
list of genes to those showing the same trend in a unique
clinical cohort comparing seven NEPC tumors to 30 adenocarcinoma tumors (24). There was a high overlap between the
gene lists emerging from xenograft comparisons and the
clinical data, further highlighting the ﬁdelity of our models,
with 254 up and 185 downregulated genes shared (Fig. 5D;
Supplementary Table S2). The upregulated signature was
highly enriched for genes involved in neuron differentiation
(GO, 0030182; Benjamini–Hochberg corrected P ¼ 4.4  105),
and included key regulatory genes such as MYT1, PROX1,
DPYSL5, APLP1, CELSR3, WDR62, UHRF1, and MYBL2. Evaluation of these genes in another independent clinical cohort of
216 adenocarcinoma cases with signiﬁcant follow-up (6) demonstrated that they show altered expression in <10% of cases
and association with poor outcome, consistent with the low
incidence and lethality of NEPC in the clinic (Supplementary
Fig. S9). Importantly, this set of genes was not consistently
coexpressed with known neuroendocrine markers, suggesting
that their differential expression may not originate from NEPC
foci in adenocarcinoma tissue.
Xenografts are associated with clinical outcome and
provide retrospective prognostic information
Despite successful establishment of 12 lines from 7 different
patients, tumors from 9 of 16 of the original patients failed to
exhibit signiﬁcant growth after 2.5 years of serial passaging in
mice. These "static" xenografts still exhibited healthy and viable
tissue (Fig. 5E), suggesting tumor quiescence. To our knowledge, the survival of healthy human tissue in the absence of

1280

growth for this length of time is quite unprecedented and
highlights the remarkable ﬁdelity of the SRC grafting process.
Interestingly, the failure or success of xenograft line development provided retrospective prognostic information (Supplementary Table S3). First, only 2 of 9 of the patients whose
grafted tumors remained static had a PSA recurrence, compared with all (7 of 7) whose tumors led to successful xenograft
line development (P ¼ 0.0032, Fisher exact test). Second, the
patients whose grafts developed into transplantable tumor
lines demonstrated poorer overall survival compared with
those whose grafts were static (P ¼ 0.0389, log-rank
test; Fig. 5F). Finally, we also observed that within the LTL
panel, latency brevity before tumor line development was
signiﬁcantly correlated with time to PSA recurrence in the
patient (r2 ¼ 0.83; P ¼ 0.0044; Supplementary Fig. S2C).

Discussion
We have established a bank of transplantable patientderived prostate tumor xenograft models that, for the ﬁrst
time, capture the diverse heterogeneity of primary prostate
cancer. Our work showed that (i) SRC grafting of intact
prostate tumors yields a very high success rate of tumor line
development; (ii) it is possible to generate transplantable
tumor lines from primary prostate tumors and even from
needle biopsy specimens; (iii) the lines retained salient features
of the original patient tumors, including histopathology, clinical marker expression, chromosomal aberration, gene expression proﬁles, and tumor aggressiveness; (iv) the lines span
major histopathologic and molecular subtypes of prostate
cancer, capturing the diverse heterogeneity observed in the
clinic for the ﬁrst time; (v) host castration elicited a varied
response, including progression to AR-dependent CRPC and
neuroendocrine transdifferentiation; and (vi) success of tumor
line development provides potential prognostic information
for disease recurrence.
Although we, and others, have previously established the
advantage of SRC grafting over traditional subcutaneous sites
(19), previous reports focussed on the ﬁrst generation of grafts
with relatively short observation time, e.g., 3 months
(18, 38, 39). As such, transplantable tumor lines, akin to those
presented here, were not developed. One of the major advantages of SRC grafting over traditional subcutaneous grafting is
the high tumor take rate (94%) and success rate of transplantable tumor line development (44%); largely due to the vascularization of the kidney (40, 41). The abundant supply of
nutrients, hormones, growth factors, and oxygen to transplanted cells and tissues (before they become vascularized)
at the SRC site is likely instrumental to the success of the
engraftment, and the conservation of patient tumor properties
(42–44). The only property that we did not observe in our
models is the propensity of clinical prostate tumors to metastasize to the bone. This is probably due to the difference in
bone marrow microenvironment between human and mouse
(45, 46).
Intratumoral heterogeneity within clinical samples presents
signiﬁcant difﬁculties for researchers attempting to functionally dissect cancer biology. For example, it has been reported

Next-Generation Models of Prostate Cancer

that lethal metastases can arise from one cancer cell precursor
(47), but isolating the particular subpopulation most likely to
metastasize from within a mixed total population is fraught
with challenges. Therefore, our development of multiple transplantable tumor lines (LTL313A-H) from same patient's different primary tumor biopsies provides a next-generation
model of intratumoral heterogeneity. Conserved genomic
aberrations suggest that these ﬁve lines were clonally related,
but they exhibited varied metastatic potential, growth rates,
and response to castration (development of CRPC in
LTL313BR). We anticipate that detailed molecular analyses of
these lines will allow an increased understanding of disease
progression and the identiﬁcation of biomarkers for metastasis. Limited successes are beginning to emerge, with the
identiﬁcation of differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNA)
between the metastatic and nonmetastatic lines, LTL313B and
LTL313H (48).
Success or failure of tumor line development highlights the
clinical relevance of our model system. Patients whose grafted
tumors developed into transplantable tumor lines had significantly worse clinical outcome than those patients whose
grafts remained static. Therefore, the ability of a grafted tumor
to grow and thrive within the host seems to be linked to its
aggressiveness in the patient, as opposed to experimental
variability (a similar observation has been noted in breast
cancer xenograft models; ref. 49). Murine stromal inﬁltration
was observed in both the static grafts and the transplantable
tumor lines, consistent with previous studies (49, 50) and
suggesting that the quiescent state is independent of mouse
stroma. It is likely that the static tumors reﬂect the common
clinical scenario in which a proportion of patients have slowgrowing cancer, which can be managed through active surveillance. Interestingly, we also observed that latency (the time
from initial engraftment to tumor line development) was
signiﬁcantly correlated with matched patients' time to PSA
recurrence, providing retrospective prognostic information.
All our adenocarcinoma lines respond to androgen withdrawal
and bicalutamide treatment, consistent with the clinic where
almost all patients initially respond to androgen-withdrawal
therapy. A large fraction of patients eventually fail androgenablation therapies and relapse with CRPC: a scenario also
observed in our models, in which two tumor lines relapsed
as CRPC, several months postcastration.
Because CRPC is responsible for the majority of patient
deaths, the development of CRPC directly from two hormonena€ve patient-tissue derived lines will be useful for understanding and combating therapy resistance. Furthermore, the complete transformation of adenocarcinoma in LTL331 to uniform
NEPC observed in the CRPC LTL331R (in contrast with previously reported xenografts derived directly from clinical NEPC
samples; refs. 14, 51), represents that the ﬁrst time neuroendocrine transdifferentiation has been captured in a preclinical
model, and provides strong evidence for epithelial plasticity.
Although current therapeutic development focuses on ARdependent CRPC, there are no targeted treatments for NEPC,
and it is hypothesized that the emergence of more potent
androgen deprivation therapies [e.g., enzalutamide (52) and
abiraterone (53)] will increase the incidence of treatment-

induced NEPC. Therefore, our unique model of neuroendocrine transdifferentiation provides a valuable tool for studying
the mechanisms of NEPC development and developing novel
therapeutic avenues. Indeed, the power and ﬁdelity of this
model was demonstrated by a gene expression comparison
leveraging clinical cohorts, generating a set of genes potentially
involved with neuroendocrine transdifferentiation. Continued
reﬁnement of the emergent gene set using higher-resolution
technologies is undoubtedly necessary, but the potential for
their development as novel molecular markers to aid risk
stratiﬁcation and predict therapy response is clear.
First or early-generation xenografts, which closely mimic
a patient's cancer, are especially suitable for "personalized
oncology," in which the most effective and least toxic chemotherapeutic regimen is chosen for a patient (16, 54, 55).
Early-generation SRC grafts feature most, if not all, of the
molecular heterogeneity and histologic complexity that exist
in a patient's original cancer. Importantly, all transplantable
tumor lines are preserved as frozen stocks at early generations, ensuring that cellular characteristics and composition
are maintained, and allowing reproducible and reliable
results. The ability to successfully develop transplantable
tumor lines from patient tumor needle biopsy specimens
(LTL310, 311, and 313A-H) is highly clinically relevant. In
prostate cancer, biopsies are typically obtained at diagnosis,
and with 98% of patients surviving >10 years after diagnosis,
the time-frame for personalized oncology based on an
understanding of an individual's biopsies is clearly realistic.
Needle biopsy specimens are more practical to obtain than
prostatectomy samples, and because they are taken before
prostatectomy, their analyses buys time to develop appropriate therapeutic strategies if necessary. Furthermore,
because we demonstrated that grafted tumor growth was
correlated with poor clinical outcome, they may help distinguish aggressive from indolent disease.
Beyond personalized oncology, we anticipate that our
transplantable tumor lines will provide models for preclinical drug evaluation. The potential for this is evidenced by
two recent studies that used LTL352 in combination with
advanced genomic and transcriptomic proﬁling to identify
and test new drug targets (24, 56). Moreover, translational
research using LTL313 led to the discovery of an anti-AR
small molecule (57) and a drug candidate, OMN54, which has
advanced to a phase I clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identiﬁer: NCT01555242). In recognition that the SRC grafting
method is technically more demanding than the widely used
subcutaneous method, our models are publicly available to
the research community (http://www.livingtumorlab.com).
Furthermore, several of the LTL models (e.g., LTL331R and
LTL352), once established, can be grafted subcutaneously
either from fresh tissue or frozen seeds. Therefore, we
anticipate that our panel of xenograft models, covering a
number of molecular subtypes, will deliver clinically relevant
model systems for the development of novel therapeutic
approaches to prostate cancer.
