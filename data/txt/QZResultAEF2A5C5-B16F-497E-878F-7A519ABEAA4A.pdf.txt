BACKGROUND: The postcystectomy survival benefit associated with the combination of methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (MVAC) neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NC) for muscle-invasive bladder
cancer has been most evident in patients who achieve a pathologic complete response. The outcome of
NC and open radical cystectomy (RC) was evaluated in a contemporary cohort of patients in a tertiary
referral setting. METHODS: From January 2006 to November 2007, 117 patients underwent open RC at
Cleveland Clinic for muscle-invasive bladder cancer, 29 (25%) of whom received NC. Patient information
was obtained from a prospective database. RESULTS: Clinical stage at the time of diagnosis in the NC
cohort was T2 in 23 (79%) and T3-4a in 6 (21%) patients. A total of 20 (69%) patients received the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC), 4 (14%) received MVAC, and 5 (17%) received other regimens. The
median interval from the time of diagnosis of muscle-invasive bladder cancer to RC was 208 days (interquartile range, 149 days -327 days) in the NC cohort. Overall, only 2 patients (7%; 95% confidence interval
[95% CI], 0 patients-17 patients) achieved a pathologic complete response, 18 (62%; 95% CI, 43 patients-81
patients) had nonorgan-confined residual cancer, and the overall median progression-free survival was 10.5
months (95% CI, 7 months -14 months). CONCLUSIONS: Few RC patients in these investigators’ recent experience achieved a pathologic complete response with NC, and most experienced rapid disease progression. These poor outcomes may be related to the use of non-MVAC-based regimens or excessive delay in
performing RC. In the absence of supportive data for GC in the neoadjuvant setting, MVAC remained
the preferred regimen. Excessive delays in performing RC may negate the benefit of NC. Cancer

Down-staging With Chemotherapy for Urothelial Ca/Weight et al

The use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NC) before
open radical cystectomy (RC) for invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is supported by level I evidence demonstrating a survival benefit compared with RC alone. A
phase 3 randomized trial by the Southwest Oncology
Group (SWOG 8710) showed a 25% and 40% relative
risk reduction in all-cause and cancer-specific mortality,
respectively, in patients receiving 3 cycles of the neoadjuvant combination of methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (MVAC).1 This survival benefit was
observed across all clinical stages. A meta-analysis of 11
other phase 3 randomized trials demonstrated a significant benefit with NC, equivalent to a 5% absolute
improvement in survival.2,3 Similar evidence in support
of adjuvant chemotherapy is not as robust because these
trials were flawed by poor design, protocol violations, and
inadequate sample sizes. As such, NC before RC is considered by many to be the standard of care for muscle-invasive bladder cancer.4
Neoadjuvant MVAC is associated with substantial
pathologic down-staging as pathologic complete
responses (pCR; defined as no viable cancer within the
cystectomy specimen) have been reported in 33% to 40%
of patients receiving 2 to 3 cycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy compared with a rate of 6% to 15% of pathologic stage T0 (pT0) in patients treated with RC alone.1,510
In SWOG 8710, a pCR with neoadjuvant MVAC was
observed in 50% and 30% of patients with clinical stage
T2 and T3-4a bladder cancer, respectively.1 In a secondary analysis, the survival benefit associated with NC was
principally observed in patients achieving a pCR; 85% of
these patients were alive at 5 years, whereas the median
survival of patients with residual cancer after NC was
between 2.4 and 3.8 years. The favorable outcome of
patients with a pCR after neoadjuvant MVAC has been
reported by others.6 Hence, the ability to achieve a pCR
may be considered a reasonable substitute endpoint for
overall survival to assess the efficacy of NC.
Over the past decade, the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) has supplanted MVAC as the
standard regimen for advanced bladder cancer due to an
improved toxicity profile without substantial differences
in overall or progression-free survival.11,12 Based on this
evidence, GC is often substituted for MVAC for patients
receiving NC before RC, despite the lack of evidence indicating a similar benefit in this setting. The logic of
Cancer

improved toxicity is not justification for the use of neoadjuvant GC given the lack of evidence that neoadjuvant
MVAC precludes or delays RC in a substantial number of
patients.1,6
In a contemporary cohort of patients with clinical
stage T2 through T4a bladder cancer, the pathologic
responses to NC and postcystectomy survival were analyzed and compared with published clinical trials. We
hypothesize that, if GC is equivalent to MVAC in the
neoadjuvant setting, pCR rates should be similar.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
From January 2006 through November 2007, 244 consecutive patients with localized urothelial carcinoma of
the bladder underwent RC at Cleveland Clinic (Cleveland, Ohio). Patients who underwent a laparoscopic RC
(n ¼ 79), had nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer
(n ¼ 43), underwent salvage RC after chemoradiation
(n ¼ 3), or participated in a phase 2 neoadjuvant protocol
(n ¼ 2) were excluded. Of the 117 patients with clinical
stage T2 through T4a, N0-2, M0 bladder cancer who
underwent open RC, 29 (25%) received NC. The decision to administer NC in the absence of advanced clinical
features varied according to patient and surgeon preference. All patients were staged clinically with computed tomography (CT) scans of the abdomen and pelvis and
either CT scan of the chest or chest x-ray.
All patients underwent open RC. The choice of urinary diversion was left to surgeon and/or patient preference. The extent of pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND)
varied by surgeon; all patients had at a minimum a standard PLND (level I—hypogastric, external iliac, obturator,
and distal common iliac lymph nodes), and some surgeons routinely performed extended PLND (level I and
level II—presacral and common iliac lymph nodes to aortic bifurcation) with or without removal of lymph nodes
in level III (para-aortic, paracaval, and interaortocaval
retroperitoneal lymph nodes to the inferior mesenteric
artery).13
All patients had muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder confirmed by review of transurethral
resection (TUR) specimens by genitourinary pathologists
at our institution before treatment. Pathologic analysis of
the RC specimen included extensive macroscopic and histologic evaluation. Specifically, residual macroscopic
793

Original Article

tumor or identifiable scar from prior transurethral resection were sampled at 1 to 2 sections/cm, which included
complete transmural sections of the bladder wall to accurately determine pathologic stage. In addition, several histologic sections from various anatomic sites within the
bladder, including the dome, anterior wall, lateral walls,
posterior wall, trigone, urethra, and bilateral ureters were
sampled for superficial disease or a second primary tumor.
In cystoprostatectomy specimens, the prostate and the
prostatic urethra were extensively sampled to identify the
presence of superficial or invasive disease into the prostatic
stroma. All tumors were staged according to the criteria
set forth in the American Joint Committee on Cancer
staging manual.14 All lymph nodes were entirely submitted for analysis per designated site and representative sections of surrounding fibroadipose tissue were in addition
sampled. Review of all slides was performed by an experienced genitourinary pathologist. No evidence of bladder
cancer in the RC specimen or lymph nodes was classified
as pCR (or pT0 in patients not receiving NC).
Patient clinical information and follow-up data were
obtained from a prospectively maintained RC database after patient consent. Data were analyzed using SPSS 12.0
statistical software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill). Proportions
were analyzed with the chi-square test. Continuous variables were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U test. Postcystectomy survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier
method. The association of parameters with pathologic
outcomes was assessed using logistic regression analysis.
All P values resulted from the use of 2-sided statistical
tests, and the level of significance was set at .05. The study
was conducted under Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act guidelines and received institutional
review board approval.

RESULTS
Patient preoperative characteristics for the NC cohort are
presented in Table 1. Clinical stage at diagnosis was T2 in
23 patients (79%), T3 in 5 patients (17%), and T4a in 1
patient (3%). Four patients (14%) were found to have
enlarged lymph nodes (>1.5 cm) on pretreatment imaging. Chemotherapy received was GC (paclitaxel) in 20
patients (69%), MVAC in 4 patients (14%), gemcitabine
and carboplatin in 3 patients (10%), single-agent gemcitabine in 1 patient, and etoposide and cisplatin in 1 patient

received was 3 (range, 1 cycle-8 cycles).
Pathologic outcomes are summarized in Table 2
according to NC status. Overall, only 2 patients (7%;
95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0 patient-17 patients)
in the NC cohort achieved a pCR, both of whom received
GC (paclitaxel) compared with 8 (9%; 95% CI, 3
patients -15 patients) who were pT0 in the immediate RC
cohort (P ¼ .9). Both the NC and immediate RC cohorts
were comparable with regard to pathologic stage, soft tissue surgical margins, number of lymph nodes removed,
and lymph node density. Overall, 62% (95% CI, 43
patients -81 patients) versus 60% (95% CI, 50 patients 70 patients) of patients had nonorgan-confined cancer
(pT3-4 or pN1-2) in the NC and immediate RC cohorts,
respectively (P ¼ .9). Of the 20 NC patients with clinical
stage T2N0, 1 (5%; 95% CI, 0 patients -15 patients)
achieved a pCR and 11 (55%; 95% CI, 31 patients -79
patients) had nonorgan-confined residual cancer. Comparing MVAC and GC with other chemotherapy regimens, there was a trend toward improved pathologic stage
with MVAC and GC (nonorgan-confined cancer, 44% vs
66%) that did not reach statistical significance (P ¼ .3).
Over a median follow-up of 12 months (interquartile range [IQR], 6 months-16 months) in the NC cohort,
13 (45%) patients experienced cancer recurrence and 7
(24%) died of bladder cancer. The median recurrencefree and overall survivals were 10.5 months (95% CI, 7

months-14 months) and 20 months (95% CI, 19
months-21 months), respectively. In patients receiving
immediate RC, the median survival was not reached and
the 2-year survival rate was 59% (95% CI, 45%-63%)
(Fig. 1).
A delay in RC has been previously reported to be
associated with advanced pathologic stage and diminished
postcystectomy survival.15,16 The median interval from
the time of the diagnosis of muscle-invasive bladder cancer to RC was 208 days (IQR, 149 days-327 days) and 48
days (IQR, 35 days-70 days) for the NC and immediate
RC cohorts, respectively. Given that our patients are
frequently referred from locations remote to Cleveland
Clinic, NC is often administered under the care of
patients’ local oncologists. Subdividing patients into those
that received NC at our institution (n ¼ 6) versus other
centers (n ¼ 23), a significant delay in the interval from
diagnosis of muscle-invasive bladder cancer to RC was
observed for the latter group (155 vs 222 days; P ¼ .046),
and these patients also tended to have higher pathologic
stage (nonorgan-confined cancer, 33% vs 56%; P ¼ .4). A
significant association with nonorgan-confined cancer
was not observed for the interval from diagnosis to RC
(P ¼ .6), although the statistical power was small and 27
patients had a delay of >120 days. When comparing
standard with nonstandard regimens, there was a significant delay in performing RC (median of 182 days vs 332
days; P ¼ .016).

DISCUSSION
NC before RC has been increasingly used at our institution for the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer
based on level I evidence of a survival benefit. This
improvement in survival was mainly observed among
patients who achieved a pCR to NC.1 In our recent experience with NC, we failed to observe a substantial benefit
795

Original Article

with NC; few patients achieved a pCR and the rate of
nonorgan-confined cancer was similar to that of patients
undergoing RC without NC. Most patients experienced
rapid disease progression and death from bladder cancer
despite NC. Selection bias may explain these poor outcomes, although the clinical stage of our patients at diagnosis was similar to those in the SWOG 8710 study.
Alternatively, these poor outcomes may be related to the
use of non-MVAC NC regimens and/or substantial delays
in performing RC. These factors may negate the small
absolute survival benefit of NC. As such, MVAC should
be considered the standard NC regimen in the absence of
supporting data. Likewise, immediate RC (adjuvant
chemotherapy based on the pathology of the RC specimen) may be a reasonable approach if NC will lead to excessive delays in performing RC.
The most compelling evidence in support of NC is
from the SWOG 8710 study, in which 3 cycles of MVAC
conferred a 14% absolute improvement in overall survival
at 5 years.1 As observed in our study, GC is now frequently substituted for MVAC in the neoadjuvant setting
based on data demonstrating similar survival and an
improved toxicity profile in patients with advanced bladder cancer.12 Extrapolation of these results to the neoadjuvant setting is potentially flawed, because these cohorts are
substantially different with regard to performance status
and potentially tumor biology.
In the absence of prospective, randomized data, we
must rely on retrospective surgical series comparing pCR
rates and survival among patients receiving MVAC and
GC to determine whether benefits in the neoadjuvant setting are similar. A pCR appears to be a reasonable substitute endpoint with which to assess the efficacy of various
NC regimens because the survival benefit of NC is largely
restricted to these patients. In the SWOG 8710 study, the
pCR rate was 38% (95% CI, 29%-47%) with MVAC,
which was similar to the 32% (95% CI, 26%-39%) rate
reported in a Medical Research Council NC trial of cisplatin, methotrexate, and vinblastine.5 In our study of
patients largely treated with GC, the pCR rate was 7%,
which is substantially lower than that reported in these trials and closer to the pT0 rates reported in RC series without NC.1,5,7-10
One possible explanation for these poor results is the
use of non-MVAC regimens. There is sufficient evidence
in the literature that NC regimens using single-agent cis796

platin or carboplatin-based combination chemotherapy
regimens produce inferior outcomes compared with
MVAC. A recent meta-analysis reported a trend toward
decreased survival among patients receiving NC with single-agent cisplatin compared with immediate RC.3 An
NC trial of 3 cycles of the combination of paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and carboplatin reported a clinical CR of 46%,
although only 40% of these patients were confirmed to
have a pCR at RC.17 This finding translates into an overall pCR of 15%, which is well below the pCR rate
reported in the SWOG 8710 study. A 32% pCR was
reported among 22 patients who were evaluable for
response in a similar NC trial evaluating 3 cycles of this
regimen, although the pCR rate was only 22% by intentto-treat analysis.18 To our knowledge to date, direct comparisons between MVAC and GC in a randomized trial
have not been conducted in localized bladder cancer. A
retrospective series of 42 patients receiving neoadjuvant
GC before RC at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center reported a 26% (95% CI, 14%-42%) rate of
pCR, which was similar to a historical cohort of patients
receiving neoadjuvant MVAC on protocol before RC or
partial cystectomy.19 However, limitations of this study
were that patients who received NC at an outside institution were not included and that the number of patients
who underwent immediate RC during the same time
period was not reported, suggesting a potential selection
bias.
A review of phase 2 of 3 trials of MVAC and GC in
patients with advanced bladder cancer demonstrated similar overall and complete clinical response rates in the majority, but the 3 highest clinical CR rates (23%-50%)
have been observed in patients receiving MVAC (Table
3).12,20-29 This finding suggests potentially greater activity
for MVAC in achieving a complete CR and potential superiority over GC as a NC regimen. However, differences
in overall and complete responses in phase 2 trials may
simply be due to case-mix and methods of evaluation.
Indeed, the clinical CR in a phase 3 trial comparing
MVAC and GC in patients with advanced bladder cancer
was similar and overall survival was not found to be significantly different. However, these results were achieved despite MVAC patients receiving less therapy than GC
patients in terms of number of cycles of chemotherapy
(median, 4 cycles vs 6 cycles) and dose reductions (63% vs
37%) due to toxicity.

In the neoadjuvant setting, in which the patients are
healthier and the performance status is better, one would
anticipate that proportionately more patients would
receive all planned cycles of chemotherapy without substantial dose reductions. For example, before RC, most
patients (82%) have Karnofsky performance status scores
of >90%,30 whereas in the metastatic setting, >40% of
patients have a Karnofsky performance status scores of
<80%.27 In NC trials with MVAC, 80% completed the
prescribed regimen, and treatment-related mortality due
to chemotherapy is reported in 0% to 1% of patients.1,5
Thus, the aforementioned differences in clinical CR rates
between GC and MVAC in the phase 2 trials may indeed
become significant in a neoadjuvant setting. MVAC may
be the more effective regimen if it can be tolerated.
Ideally, the use of GC as a standard NC regimen for muscle-invasive bladder cancer should be based on evidence
from randomized trials demonstrating noninferiority or
equivalence with MVAC. However, a noninferiority trial
with 90% power to rule out a difference in overall survival
>10% at 5 years associated with neoadjuvant GC (assuming a 5-year overall survival rate of 58% with neoadjuvant
MVAC) would require >5000 patients. A trial of this size
is unlikely to be successful when one considers the historical accrual rates to randomized trials of localized muscleinvasive bladder cancer worldwide; 317 patients were

accrued to the SWOG 8710 study over 11 years through
the intergroup mechanism in the US.
Another possible explanation for the poor results
observed with NC in the current study is selection bias; it
is possible that only the more aggressive cases were
selected for NC in our cohort. However, our cohort compares favorably with patients in the SWOG 8710 study
and patients undergoing immediate RC at our institution;
79% of NC patients in the current study had clinical stage
T2 disease compared with 40% in the SWOG 8710
study, and the median age in both studies was 63 years.
We included 4 patients in our analysis with clinically positive lymph nodes and patients with this feature were
excluded from the SWOG 8710 study. However, if we
exclude these patients, the pCR rate on the remaining 25
patients is 4%. A higher rate of lymph node-positive disease was observed in the current series, which may be due
to the referral of patients with less complicated, lower
stage bladder cancer for laparoscopic RC.
In our NC patients, we observed considerable delays
in performing RC, which may have contributed to the disappointing outcomes. Several authors have recognized
that a delay in RC results in worse pathologic stage and
diminished survival.15,16 NC undoubtedly delays definitive therapy, but current evidence suggests any adverse
effect of this delay is offset by the benefit of neoadjuvant
MVAC. It must be emphasized that the median interval
to RC in the SWOG 8710 study for patients receiving
NC was 115 days, which was a delay in RC of 98 days on
average compared with patients in the control arm (median interval to RC of 17 days). In our NC cohort, the
median time to RC from the time of diagnosis of muscleinvasive cancer was 208 days. This delay is substantially
longer than that reported in the NC arm of the SWOG
8710 study and 160 days longer than patients at our institution undergoing immediate RC.1 Although definitive
conclusions cannot be made from this study, it is plausible
that an excessive delay (120 days) in performing RC
may negate the survival benefit of NC. Thus, if NC cannot be administered in a timely manner, it may be prudent to proceed directly with RC and reserve
perioperative chemotherapy for the adjuvant setting. The
interval to RC observed in the current series may more
closely represent the typical time frame for a patient
receiving NC and RC at a tertiary referral center compared with that reported in patients treated on-protocol in
797

Original Article

a phase 3 randomized trial. These practical issues should
be considered when counseling patients on the benefits
and risks of NC.
Difficulties in executing a coordinated treatment
plan between urologists and medical oncologists at remote
locations may be the cause of the delay observed in the
current study. In the US, muscle-invasive bladder cancer
is often diagnosed in the community setting, but RC is
increasingly being performed at high-volume tertiary
referral hospitals; perioperative chemotherapy is frequently administered by local medical oncologists. Few
patients in the current study received NC at our institution, and these patients received NC and proceeded to RC
in a timely manner (median of 155 days from the time of
diagnosis to RC) and the median delay in RC compared
with patients undergoing immediate RC (107 days) was
similar to that of patients in the SWOG 8710 study (98
days). In contrast, the median time from diagnosis to RC
for those patients who received chemotherapy from outside oncologists was 222 days. Although the numbers are
small and preclude definitive conclusions, the 6 patients
receiving NC at our institution demonstrated a trend toward a lower pathologic stage.
The current study is limited by its retrospective nature, small patient numbers, and lack of standardization
regarding the administration of NC and the regimens
used. Nevertheless, the 95% CIs of the pCR rate and median survival estimates do not approach those reported in
the SWOG 8710 study.
We believe the combination of NC and RC is the
optimal approach to the treatment of patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer given the level I evidence demonstrating a reduction in all-cause and cancer-specific
mortality, and the lack of similar evidence in support of
adjuvant chemotherapy. There is also evidence that
patients are more likely to receive both RC and the
planned number of cycles of chemotherapy if it is administered in the neoadjuvant setting due to the frequent
complications and prolonged convalescence associated
with RC.4,6 However, the results of the current study call
into question the benefit of NC if non-MVAC regimens
are administered or if NC leads to excessive delays in performing RC. These deviations from the optimal approach
(3 cycles of neoadjuvant MVAC and timely RC) may negate the benefit of NC. We believe these issues are important for physicians and patients to be aware of when
798

considering the use of non-MVAC neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens or when substantial delays (120 days)
in performing RC are anticipated.
Conclusions
Few RC patients in our recent experience achieved a pCR
with NC and most experienced rapid disease progression.
These poor outcomes may be related to the use of nonMVAC-based regimens or excessive delays in performing
RC. In the absence of supportive data for GC in the neoadjuvant setting, MVAC remains the preferred regimen.
Excessive delays in performing RC may negate the benefit
of NC.
