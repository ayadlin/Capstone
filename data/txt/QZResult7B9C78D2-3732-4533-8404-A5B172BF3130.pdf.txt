ABSTRACT
Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan (90Y-IT) combines the benefits of a monoclonal antibody
with the efficacy of radiation in the treatment of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL),
a remarkably radiosensitive hematologic malignancy. 90Y-IT activity has been well
established in the indolent setting, being approved in front-line treatment of follicular
lymphoma (FL) patients as well as salvage therapy. However, no advantage in OS was
observed with respect to standard treatment. Promising data are available also for
aggressive B-cell lymphoma. In particular, the addition of RIT to short-course first
line chemotherapy enables reduction of chemotherapy while maintaining cure rates
in elderly, untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients. Furthermore,
90Y-IT improves response rate and outcomes of relapsed/refractory DLBCL patients,
eligible and ineligible for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Clinical
results have shown a role of 90Y-IT even in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). RIT might
improve responses and treat minimal residual disease when used as consolidation
after first-line chemotherapy in MCL. Moreover, 90Y-IT has demonstrated its efficacy
in combination with high-dose chemotherapies as conditioning regimen for ASCT,
with evidence suggesting the ability to overcome chemotherapy resistance. Herein,
we review the available evidence for this approved drug and examine the recently
published and ongoing trials for potential novel indication in aggressive B-cell NHL.

INTRODUCTION

1) Moreover, radioiummunotherapy (RIT) also induces
remodeling of the tumor vasculature favouring neoplasia
eradication [4], probably by migration of immune cells
towards the malignant lesions [5].
Because CD20 is a transmembrane phosphoprotein
expressed in more than 90% of B-cell NHL, in mature
B-cells and pre-B cells, but not in plasma cells or stem
cells, it represents an attractive target in lymphoma. [6]
Currently, there are two approved RIT agents for use in B
cell lymphoma: 131 I-tositumomab (Bexxar®; GSK) and
90 Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan (90Y-IT) Zevalin®; Spectrum
pharmaceuticals), both targeting CD20. [7, 8] These agents
utilize radionuclides that decay by releasing beta particles
(high-energy electrons) exerting their lethal effects by
causing double-strand DNA breaks in tumor cells.
Bexxar® consists of Iodine-131, a radiation-emitting

More than a decade ago, monoclonal antigens
targeting B-cell specific antigens to treat B-cell nonHodgkin lymphomas (NHL) entered clinical routine.
[1-3] Nevertheless, in some patients, B-cell lymphomas
were a priori resistant to such drugs [4] or developed
resistance during therapy. An alternative approach to
achieve an additional cytotoxic effect and to overcome
some resistance mechanisms was to conjugate monoclonal
antibodies to a radioisotope since most lymphomas are
highly radiosensitive. In detail, the radiolabeled antibosdy
binds to a specific antigen present on cancer cells, bringing
the radioactive substance close to the neoplastic cell. This
leads not only to death of the bound cancer cell, but also
to that of the surrounding cells (“crossfire effect”). (Figure

form of iodine, conjugated to the monoclonal antibody
tositumomab, which binds to CD20. lodine-131 emits
beta and gamma radiation. Beta radiation is responsible
for most of the tumor killing effect while gamma radiation
allows gamma camera scans to evaluate the distribution
and clearance of radiation from the patient’s body.
Iodine-131 is eliminated from the body mainly through
the urine and by the natural decay of lodine-131.
Instead, Zevalin® consists of indium-111 or
yttrium-90 conjugated to ibritumomab which targets
CD20. Indium-111 is a gamma emitter used for imaging
studies. In November 2011, the FDA considered the
biodistribution scan no longer necessary since five
prospective trials demonstrated that a true altered
biodistribution occurs in approximately only 1% of
patients, which is why it is no longer used. [9] Instead,
the yttrium-90 radioisotope is a pure beta emitter able
to damage and kill the targeted cancer cells as well as
nearby cells independently of their CD20 expression.
Because of the pure beta emission from yttrium-90
radioisotope, patients do not need any special safety
precautions. [10] The situation regarding the special care
of patients varies from country to country according to
local radio protection laws. For example, Germany and
Austria require isolation in a nuclear medicine ward for
patients undergoing 90Y-IT treatment. If administered
correctly, the mean effective half-life of this drug in
blood is 27 hours (range 14-44 h) [11]. Urinary excretion
is the primary clearance mechanism, and it accounts for
the elimination of almost 10% of unbound 90Y within
the first 12 to 24 hours, while the remaining 90% decay.
Dosing of 90Y-IT is based on the patient’s weight and
platelet count. For patients with a platelet count greater
than 150,000/μL, the prescribed dose is 0.4 mCi/kg up to

a maximum of 32 mCi. For patients with a platelet count
between 100,000 to 150,000/μ L, the dose is 0.3 mCi/kg,
again up to a maximum of 32 mCi. The most common
toxicity for both radioisotopes is myelosuppresion with
thrombocytopenia and neutropenia usually begins two
to three weeks following the therapeutic dose, remaining
low for several weeks and baseline levels being recovered
after two to three months. [12] Therefore, the majority
of trials investigating RIT activity in B-cell NHL had an
inclusion limit of 25% bone marrow infiltration to avoid
excessive hematoxicity. Non-haematological toxicities are
uncommon and usually minor.
Both agents are currently indicated for the treatment
of relapsed or refractory CD20-positive lymphomas,
but Bexxar® was withdrawn from the market in October
2013 for commercial reasons. 90Y-IT has an additional
treatment indication as consolidation therapy in previously
untreated FL patients who achieve a complete response
(CR) or a partial response (PR) to first-line chemotherapy.

FOLLICULAR LYMPHOMA
Front-line setting
Although FL is characterized by a high overall
response rate (ORR) to a single-agent or multidrug
immunochemotherapy, relapses are frequent and tend to
be less responsive to the next line treatment, which is why
advanced stage FL is still considered as incurable with
the current standard of care [13]. Moreover, after the first
relapse, the time to next recurrence is shorter leading to a
median overall survival of 4-5 years. For these reasons,

achieving CR or even elimination of minimal residual

following treatment lines. Several authors investigated the
administration of 90Y-IT either as consolidation treatment
after immunochemotherapy or as monotherapy in first line
Table 1.

of investigators’s choice, patients were randomized to
receive either standard dose of 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan
(n = 208) or no further treatment (n = 206). The regimens
used were cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone
(CVP/COP) (n = 106), anthracyclin-based regimens (n =
183), fludarabine-based therapies (n = 22), chlorambucil
(n = 39) and rituximab in association with chemotherapy
(n = 59). After (immuno-)chemotherapy, the CR rate
was similar in both arms (53% in the observation arm
and 52% in the 90Y-IT arm). After RIT almost threequarters of patients in PR converted to CR, leading to
CR rate of 87%. This response improvement led to a
significant PFS prolongation of more than 2 years in the
RIT-consolidation arm as compared to the control arm. In
detail, PFS was 49 vs 15 months in all responders, 30 vs
6 months for partial responders and 92 vs 32 months in
complete responders, suggesting that 90Y-IT improves

RIT as consolidation after induction therapy
In FL, as in other hematologic neoplasias,
MRD is becoming always more important since it
significantly improves the outcome [14]. Therefore, RIT
as consolidation after induction immunochemotherapy
could induce a more profound response, postponing
an eventual relapse or even lead to cure of the disease.
Indeed, the FIT randomized phase III trial [15] proved
a benefit for 90Y-IT as consolidation in previously
untreated FL patients. After completing induction therapy

PFS regardless of response to therapy. Moreover, 90Y-IT
was able to prolong median time to next treatment (TTNT)
for more than 5-years in comparison to the control group.
However, there was no statistical significant difference
in OS, probably due to the usually indolent clinical
course of FL. Despite these promising results, their value
for current clinical routine is limited since almost all
patients nowadays receive rituximab in first line, while
in the FIT trial approximately only 14% underwent
immunochemotherapy. This because at the time the study
was designed rituximab was not yet a standard agent for
front-line therapy in some countries involved int the trial.
Due to the small number of rituximab-treated patients,
the subgroup analysis including only those patients was
insufficiently powered to detect a difference in final CR
rates (93% for the 90Y-IT arm vs 71% for the observation
arm) or in rates of conversion from PR to CR (71% vs
42%, respectively) despite promising results.
The use of RIT as first line consolidation
might also allow for the reduction of the number of
immunochemotherapy cycles. Five studies investigated
90Y-IT consolidation after abbreviated courses of
rituximab-based induction regimens. Hainsworth et al.
[16] conducted a phase II trial including 41 patients with
previously untreated FL who received rituximab for 4
consecutive weeks, followed by 3 cycles of rituximab
combined with either CHOP (88%) or CVP (12%) prior
to 90Y-IT consolidation. 90Y-IT was able to increase the
CR rate from 30% to 72%. After a median follow-up of 67
months, the estimated 5-year PFS and OS rates were 64%
and 96% (p = 0.3), respectively. Another phase II trial [17]
included 60 patients with stage II-IV symptomatic or bulky
FL who received three cycles of R-CHOP followed by RIT
and four additional weekly rituximab administrations.
The percentage of CR assessed with positron emission
tomography (PET), improved from 46% after induction
therapy to 89% following 90Y-IT consolidation. The
remaining three trials [18-20] investigated the efficacy
of fludarabine-based immunochemotherapy regimens
plus 4 or more cycles of rituximab followed by RIT
consolidation, with or without adjuvant rituximab
maintenance, in untreated and intermediate/high risk FL
patients. The conversion rates from PR to CR after RIT
varied from 13% to 95%, conferming that the addition
of RIT consolidation to immunochemotherapy was able
to improve the quality of responses as well as long-term
outcomes, even for patients previously treated with
rituximab. Therefore, 90Y-IT is an interesting treatment
option for a subgroup of FL pateints, for example those
who are not eligible for rituximab maintenance. [21, 22]

RIT was 87%, with 41% of the patients achieving CR,
15% CR unconfirmed (CRu), and 31% PR. Median PFS
was 25.9 months. Compared with the standard first line
immunochemotherapies, the CR rates achieved with 90YIT are similar [24], while median PFS was below the
reported values [24, 25]. However, patients in CR after
RIT alone in first line achieved long-lasting remission
with a PFS not reached after a follow-up of nearly 31
months. 90Y-IT might delay or even avoid the need for
chemotherapy in first line for a considerable number
of patients, leaving aggressive regimens an option for
relapsed FL. Furthermore, 90Y-IT as first line treatment
has achieved a superior ORR with respect to four courses
of rituximab monotherapy in the same setting. [23] In
all trials, RIT was safe with the most common adverse
event being transient myelosuppresion. Non-hematologic
toxicities were unfrequent and never exceeded grade 2.
The favourable toxicity profile and the efficacy of
90Y-IT were also confirmed in a more recent phase II
trial [26] evaluating a fractionated 90Y-IT administration
(11.1MBq/kg given 8-12 weeks apart) in 74 untreated, fit
FL patients. The ORR was 96% with 69% CR/CRu. After
a median follow-up of 3.1 years, PFS was 58%, treatmentfree survival 66%, and OS 95%. Noteworthy, in this study
the patient cohort had a more unfavourable baseline
characteristics profile with respect to the previous one
[23] with almost twice as many high-risk FLIPI patients
(44%), but displayed a superior median PFS (40.2 v 26
months). In addition, 3-year PFS of 85% (median not
reached) for patients with CR was markedly improved
compared with the 1- and 2-year PFS rates of 77% and
54% reported by Scholz [23]. No significant difference
in PFS was observed for patients with or without bulky
disease, suggesting that patients with large initial tumor
bulks may benefit from fractionation of the therapy. Tumor
regression after the initial 90Y-IT infusion may allow
improved delivery to sites of bulk with the second fraction.
[26] The median PFS of 40.2 months is in line with the
one after non-anthracycline-based regimen (eg. R-CVP),
but slightly inferior to R-CHOP and R-Bendamustine [24,
25]. However, fractionated RIT led to high response rates
as initial treatment in a high-risk population with one
third of patients achieving CR and durable remissions.
Consequently, RIT might be an interesting strategy for a
selected subpopulation, not eligible for chemotherapy.
Therefore, RIT has an important part in the front line
setting, either as single agent or as consolidation following
standard chemoimmunotherapy. RIT as single agent
showed to be superior with respect to the immunotherapy,
which is why it should be considered in patients who are
not candidates for standard (immuno-)chemotherapy.
90Y-IT consolidation is superior to observation following
standard immunochemotherapy, increasing the conversion
of PR to CR, prolonging relapse free survival and
improving OS.

RIT monotherapy in first-line treatment
90Y-IT has proved to be an efficient and feasible
treatment option as front-line therapy of FL. Scholz et
al. [23] evaluated the efficacy and safety of RIT in 59
chemonaive, fit FL patients. The ORR at 6 months after

(21.1 vs. 13.8 months; P = 0.27). Interestingly, in patients
achieving a CR after 90Y-IT, the median TTP was longer,
though it was not significant when compared to the control
group (24.7 months v.s. 13.2 months; p = 0.41), suggesting
a more profound disease eradication. As observed in
other anticancer treatments, the administration of 90Y-IT
in an earlier treatment line led to a better outcome [29].
Pooled data from four clinical trials including patients
with relapsed FL demonstrated a significantly higher
ORR (86% vs 72%; p = 0.051), CR rate (51% vs 28%; p
= 0.004) and longer TTP (12.6 vs 7.9 months, p = 0.038)
when 90Y-IT was administered in first relapses compared
to a higher treatment line. Therefore, RIT represents a
valid approach for relapsed or refractory FL patients as
well, especially in elderly or unfit patients who can not
undergo transplant or aggressive regimens.

Several studies have demonstrated that 90Y-IT is
safe in patients who underwent more treatment lines with
relapsed or refractory low-grade lymphoma (Table 1)
[27-29]. Witzig et al. [27] administered 90Y-IT at a dose
of 0.4 mCi/kg to 54 FL patients, refractory to rituximab,
obtaining an ORR of 74% with 50% of CR, and median
time to progression of nearly 7 months. Based on these
results, Gordon et al. [28] randomized 143 rituximab-naive
patients with relapsed or refractory FL or transformed
B-cell NHL to receive either 90Y-IT or rituximab alone.
90Y-IT proved to be more efficient in inducing a response
than rituximab in this patient setting, leading to an ORR
and a CR rate of 80 vs 56% (p = 0.002) and 30 vs 16% (p
= 0.04), respectively. Although this study was not powered
to detect differences in time dependent variables, there
was a trend towards a longer median time to progression
(TTP; 15 vs. 10.2 months; p = 0.07), duration of response
(16.7 vs. 11.2 months; p = 0.44) and time to next therapy

remained in remission after 5-years. 90Y-IT demonstrated
to improve the ORR and reduce relapses in this setting.
These results are comparable with the two Southwestern
Oncology Group (SWOG) studies for early stage DLBCL.
Treatment consists in the SWOG0014 [35] in 3 cycles
of R-CHOP and involved field radiation therapy (IFRT)
while in the SWOG0313 [36] in 3 cycles of CHOP
followed by IFRT and then 90Y-IT. Unlike the SWOG
studies, the ECOG3402 [34] demonstrated that adding
RIT may enable reduction in chemotherapy for patients at
least in PR at ther interim restaging while maintaining cure
rates. However, in the ECOG3402 trial, interim response
was evaluated by computered tomography (CT), while
in clinical practice PET is preferred. For this reason, the
SWOG S1001 phase II trial is currently evaluating a PET
guided treatment approach in patients with limited-stage
DLBCL. After 3 cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy, all
patients will be restaged by PET/CT. Patients with a CR
will receive one additional cycle of R-CHOP, for a total
of 4 cycles. Those with a PR will receive standard dose
involved-field radiotherapy followed by a single infusion
of 90Y-IT. (NCT01359592)
RIT might have a role as consolidation after
induction therapy in elderly or unfit DLBCL patients,
allowing for the reduction of the amount of chemotherapy
and to maintain treatment efficacy. Results from the
current clinical trial will help to clarify if the combination
therapy is better than 6 full cycles of R-CHOP therapy
and whether it would be advisable in selective setting of
patients.

RIT as consolidation after induction therapy
RIT has been studied as consolidation after
CHOP-based therapy in untreated elderly DLBCL
patients [30-32]. Zinzani et al. [30] administered a 90YIT consolidation to 20 patients after 6 cycles of CHOP.
Four out of 5 patients in PR after CHOP achieved a CR,
leading to an overall CR rate of 95% and PR of 5%. The
2-year PFS was 75% with a 2-year OS of 95%. However,
CHOP is not the standard first line therapy anymore [33]
and the addition of 90Y-IT seems to have similar results
with respect to R-CHOP. Since both drugs target CD20,
the prior use of rituximab in induction treatment could
hamper the efficacy of RIT after R-CHOP. Nevertheless,
the patient group used was small and consequently it was
not possible to draw a conclusion from this study.
In a phase II study 63 high-risk elderly, untreated
DLBCL patients, who were ineligible for stem cell
transplantation, underewent 6 cycles of R-CHOP and then
those with responding or stable disease received 90Y-IT
consolidation 6-9 weeks later. After completion of the
induction treatment, 50 patients were eligible for 90Y-IT
and 44 were ultimately treated. 90Y-IT was well tolerated
and 86% of patients achieved a CR/CRu, 2% experienced
a PR, while 12% did not respond. 90Y-IT improved
response from PR to CR or CRu to CR in 16% of patients.
At 42 months, the OS for 90Y-IT treated patients was
83.5% and the PFS was 74.5%. [31]
Based on these promising data, a phase II trial
evaluated the possibility to administer a short-course
R-CHOP chemotherapy followed by 90Y-IT in order
to increase the global treatment efficacy along with a
decreased exposure to cytotoxic drugs [32]. 55 high-risk
elderly DLBCL patients received four courses of R-CHOP
and 48 underwent RIT. 90Y-IT improved the remission
status of 8/16 patients in PR after R-CHOP regimen
leading to a ORR of 80% (CR 73%, PR 7%). The 2-year
PFS was 85% with 2-year OS of 86%. These promising
results provided the rationale for a randomized, phase
III trial, which aims at evaluating the value of RIT after
R-CHOP or R-CHOP-like therapy in a large cohort of
elderly untreated, DLBCL patients (NCT01510184).
Recently, Witzig et al. [34] have evaluated the role
of 90Y-IT in early stage DLBCL. Fifty-three patients
underwent either four (21/53, 40%) or six (30/53, 57%)
cycles of R-CHOP followed by RIT. After induction
immunochemotherapy, the ORR was 98% (CR/CRu 79%,
PR 19%). Forty-eight patients proceeded to RIT. Four of
the five cases with CRu undergoing to RIT converted to
CR. Of the 10 patients in PR, three achieved a CR, one
a CRu while three did not change their status remission
and one progressed during RIT. At 5-year follow-up, PFS
was 78% and OS was 94%. Among 52 responders 84%

Relapsed/refractory DLBCL
RIT has demonstrated to be also an efficient and
safe treatment option for relapsed or refractory DLBCL
patients, achieving promising response rates and durable
disease remissions. [27, 37-39] Morschhauser et al. [37]
evaluated the efficacy of 90Y-IT in 104 DLBCL patients
who were either refractory or relapsed after first line
therapy associated or not with rituximab. The ORR was
44% and, as expected, it was higher in patients without
a prior rituximab administration compared to those who
underwent immunochemotherapy as primary treatment
(53% versus 19%, respectively). The median PFS in three
groups ranges from 1.6 to 5.9 months. Arnason et al. [39]
confirmed the potential role of RIT in this poor risk subset.
90Y-IT was administered in 25 relapsed/refractory DLBCL
patients, not candidates for transplant, followed by 4
weekly doses of rituximab. All non-progressing patients
received 4 weekly doses of maintenance rituximab every
6 months for 4 cycles. The ORR was 31% (CR 21%, PR
13%). Median event free survival (mEFS) was 2.5 months.
Median OS was 8.1 months. In addition, a study evaluating
data from 4 clinical trials using 90Y-IT in recurring NHL
demonstrated that RIT can produce durable responses
and prolonged overall survival in a substantial number

of patients in whom previous therapies have failed. The
5-year OS was 53% for all patients and 81% for long-term
responders. Therefore, RIT might be considered as a valid
therapeutic option for relapsed/refractory patients that
refuse or can not tolerate chemotherapy. Indeed, RIT has
response rate and survival similar to other chemotherapy
regimens currently available. Furthermore, RIT is
generally feasible and requires less time to complete the
treatment.
	90Y-IT in association with high-dose
chemotherapy followed by ASCT proved to be efficient
and safe in heavily pretreated patients as well. [40-42] A
phase II trial randomized 43 relapsed/refractory DLBCL
patients to receive high-dose chemotherapy consisting
in carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan
(BEAM) alone (n = 21) or combined to 90Y-IT (Z-BEAM,
n = 22). Although the PFS difference between the two
treatment arms was not statistically significant (59% and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

37% after Z-BEAM and BEAM alone, respectively; p =
0.2), two-year OS was 91% and 62% after Z-BEAM and
BEAM, respectively (p = 0.05). [40] Mei et al. reported
encouraging results using the Z-BEAM conditioning
regimen in 63 patients with transformed low grade
lymphoma, which usually has a very poor prognosis
[41]. Two-year PFS was 68%, and OS was 90%. A recent
meta-analysis has shown that Z-BEAM improves PFS
and OS at 2-years (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01) with respect
to BEAM. In addition, 90Y-IT could overcome a poor
pretransplant response rate without further toxicities. [43]
Based on these promising results, a randomized phase II
trial which compares R-BEAM with or without 90Y-IT in
DLBCL patients eligible for transplantation is currently
ongoing. (NCT00591630). This confirmatory trial will
determine the real advantage of adding 90Y-IT to highdose chemotherapy and may drive a change in the standard
conditioning regimen to use in clinical practise.

The role of 90Y-IT as consolidation after early
salvage transplant treatment was retrospectively evaluated.
Thirty-seven patients with intermediate-high risk DLBCL
not in CR assessed by PET after three cycles of R-CHOP
switched to high dose chemotherapy followed by ASCT.
Twenty patients underwent additional consolidation with
90
Y-IT. At the end of the treatment CR rate converted
from 45% to 100%. PFS (5.1 years versus 2.7 years, p
= 0.007) and DFS (4.3 years versus 2.0 years, p = 0.001)
were significantly longer in the 90Y-IT group. However, no
difference in overall survival was observed, [42] but these
are retrospective data. Currently there are no ongoing
studies to confirm this finding and, therefore, this approach
remains experimental.

chemotherapy followed by ASCT. [51] Incorporating
RIT into a transplant regimen might further enhance
eradication of residual disease after induction therapy and
ultimately prolong PFS and OS. [52-57]
A phase I dose-finding trial [55] of escalated dose
RIT followed by high dose chemotherapy with BEAM and
autologous stem cell reinfusion established the maximumtolerated radiation-absorved dose (RAD) to critical organs
as 15Gy. In this cohort, seven out of 44 patients (16%)
were affected by MCL. Among the 29 patients, (66%)
with active disease at study entry, 11 achieved CR, and 6
achieved PR after protocol treatment. The estimated 3-year
PFS and OS rates were 43% and 60%, respectively. There
was no difference in PFS and OS between the different
histologic subsets.
Based on these encouraging data, a phase II trial
[53] associating 90Y-IT with BEAM before ASCT was
conducted in patients with refractory, relapsed or poorrisk NHL. The 2-year PFS and OS in the 13 patients
included with MCL were 68% and 85%, respectively. In
order to improve outcome for patients not in CR before
ASCT the Nordic Lymphoma Group added 90Y-IT to
the high-dose induction chemotherapy. In the multicenter
phase 2 trial MCL-3 study [56] patients in PR or CRu
after first line treatment were randomized to receive
90 Y-IT in combination with BEAM or BEAC (C =
cyclophosphamide) before ASCT. Although Z-BEAM
followed by ASCT was feasible and without additional
toxicity, it was not associated with improved PFS,
probably because intensification with 90Y-IT may be
too late to improve the outcome in patients not in CR
before transplant. Similarly, a recent retrospective study
[57] has demonstrated that Z-BEAM followed by ASCT
in relapsed or refractory MCL patients is not associated
with significant survival improvement compared to the
standard rituximab and BEAM (R-BEAM). The 5-year OS
was 55% and 71% (p = 0.2) in the R-BEAM vs Z-BEAM
groups, and the 4-year PFS was 32% and 41% (p = 0.3),
respectively. Furthermore, we retrospectively asessed the
role of 90Y-IT as consolidation after ASCT in first line
(data not yet published). Treatment intensification was
well tolerated and led to a significantly longer response
duration in comparison to the standard treatment (PFS
was not reached versus 7 years, p = 0.001; OS was not
reached versus 8.1 years, p = 0.008). The 5-year PFS was
79% in the 90Y-IT group compared to 55% in the other
one. The 5-year OS was superior in the 90Y-IT group
with respect to the other one as well (96% versus 81%).
In contrast to the historical cohort, the addition of 90YIT seemed to overcome important risk factors such as
MIPI and bone marrow infiltration. Consolidation with
90
Y-IT after induction and ASCT seems not only able to
significantly reduce the number of disease recurrences but
also to delay relapse in newly diagnosed MCL patients
with intermediate/high MIPI score.
The role of RIT as consolidation of high-dose

MANTLE CELL LYMPHOMA
90Y-IT has been investigated as consolidation after
first line therapy, as part of transplantation setting and in
relapsed or refractory patients (Table 3).

Front-line setting
RIT as consolidation after induction therapy
R-CHOP as initial therapy for untreated MCL yields
a high response rate, but remissions are not durable [44,
45] Because MCL is predominantly a disease of patients
older than 60 years, a valid approach to improve R-CHOP
outcomes is to add a consolidation strategy. Because
of the activity of RIT in MCL [46, 47], its favorable
toxicity profile, and the need for a consolidation treatment
applicable to all patients, including older and less-fit
patients, the ECOG E1499 trial [48] investigated the
efficacy of 4 cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy followed
by 90Y-IT consolidation in 56 newly diagnosed stage IIIV MCL. The ORR was 88% at completion of all therapy,
with a CR rate of only 13% after R-CHOP but 67% after
90Y-IT. Time to treatment failure (TTF) was 34.2 months.
This median TTF is better than that previously reported for
six cycles of R-CHOP. [25, 44]. The 2-years OS rate was
90%, with an mPFS of 31 months. Alternative strategies to
improve R-CHOP results include maintenance. Rituximab
maintenance after R-CHOP regimen has demonstrated to
prolong response duration, achieving a PFS from 37 to
56 months [49, 50]. An interesting question would be the
comparison of RIT consolidation followed by rituximab
maintenance, with rituximab maintenance alone.
Currently, in untreated MCL patients who cannot
tolerate more-intensive regimens or clinical trials,
R-CHOP for four cycles followed by 90Y-IT could be a
reasonable approach as initial therapy.
RIT-based stem cell transplant regimens for MCL
Another approach to improve outcomes after
R-CHOP is to add consolidation therapy with high-dose

chemotherapy is unclear. Because of the contrasting results
there is no reason to change the clinical practice. Currently,
several trials evaluating RIT followed by autologous or
allogenic stem cell transpant are ongoing (NCT00505232,
NCT00695409, NCT00607854, NCT01434472) and will
help to clarify this issue.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose
that could be perceived as prejudicing the impartiality of
the research reported.

Relapsed/refractory MCL
Despite the intensification of first line treatment,
relapses remain frequent [44, 45]. Wang et al. [58]
reported a phase II trial using 90Y-IT as single agent
in 34 refractory or relapsed MCL patients. All patients
were heavily pretreated with a median of three prior
chemotherapy regimens (range 1-6). ORR was 67% with
15% of CR rate. At median follow-up of 22 months,
median OS was 21 months and mEFS was 6 months.
This single-agent activity compared favorably with that
of other single agents. [59-61] In particular, the remission
rates and progression free survival duration obtained in
patients who had previously received rituximab are similar
to previous experiences with bortezomib and temsirolimus
[59, 61]. In addition, 90Y-IT was more convenient due
to the short time required to finish the treatment (1-2
weeks) rather than protracted duration. Morover, 90YIT had fewer adverse effects than these agents. A similar
study using 90Y-IT in relapsed/refractory MCL patients
obtained comparable single-agent activity. [62] ORR was
50% with 33% of PR rate and 16% of SD. PFS was 3.9
months. However, these results are not really satisfactory.
Based on preclinical data demonstrating synergy between
proteasome inhibitor and radiation [63-65], a more recent
phase I study evaluated the safety of 90 Y-IT combined
with bortezomib in patients with relapsed or refractory
MCL. The ORR was 50% with 42% of CR rate. [66]
Given these promising results, a phase II trial is currently
evaluating the efficacy of this novel combination in
relapsed or refractory MCL. (NCT01497275)

90Y-IT is an effective and safe drug, which
combines the benefits of a monoclonal antibody with
the efficacy of radiation in the treatment of B-cell NHL,
a remarkably radiosensitive hematologic malignancy.
90Y-IT activity has been well established in the indolent
setting as supported by the FDA approval for treatment
of chemonaive and relapsed/refractory FL patients.
Nevertheless, no advantage in OS was reported with
respect to the standard. The efficacy of RIT has been
observed in aggressive NHL as well. However, future
randomized, clinical trials are warranted to clarify the
role of RIT in this setting and support its approval as
alternative therapeutic approach.
