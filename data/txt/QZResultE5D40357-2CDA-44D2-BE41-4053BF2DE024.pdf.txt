ABSTRACT
Quaking (QKI) is a tumor-suppressor gene encoding a conserved RNA-binding
protein, whose expression is downregulated in several solid tumors. Here we
report that QKI plays an important role in the immune response and suppression of
leukemogenesis. We show that the expression of Qki is reduced in lipopolysaccharide
(LPS)-challenged macrophages, suggesting that Qki is a key regulator of LPS signaling
pathway. Furthermore, LPS-induced downregulation of Qki expression is miR-155dependent. Qki overexpression impairs LPS-induced phosphorylation of JNK and
particularly p38 MAPKs, in addition to increasing the production of anti-inflammatory
cytokine IL-10. In contrast, Qki ablation decreases Fas expression and the rate
of Caspase3/7 activity, while increasing the levels of IL-1α, IL-1β and IL-6, and
p38 phosphorylation. Similarly, the p38 pathway is also a target of QKI activity in
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)-derived MEC2 cells. Finally, B-CLL patients show
lower levels of QKI expression compared with B cells from healthy donor, and Qki is
similarily downregulated with the progression of leukemia in Eµ-miR-155 transgenic
mice. Altogether, these data implicate QKI in the pathophysiology of inflammation
and oncogenesis where miR-155 is involved.

INTRODUCTION

in pre-B cell acute leukemia/high-grade lymphoma [6].
Furthermore, overexpression of miR-155 in lymphoid
tissues results in disseminated lymphoma characterized
by a clonal, transplantable pre-B-cell population of
neoplastic lymphocytes “addicted” to miR-155-activity
[7]. In hematopoietic cells, the expression of miR-155 is
controlled by several immune signals [1-3]. Thus, LPS

miR-155 is an oncogenic pro-inflammatory
microRNA (miRNA) that is up-regulated in a number
of solid tumors and liquid malignancies [1-3]. High
levels of miR-155 often correlate with a poor prognosis

induces miR-155 expression in macrophage/monocytic
cell lines of both mouse and human origin [8-9]. The
oncogenic and pro-inflammatory effects of miR-155
have been attributed at least in part to its targeting of
many transcripts encoding tumor suppressors and/or antiinflammatory factors, especially Ship1 [10-12], Socs1
[13].
Quaking (QKI, KH domain containing, RNA
binding) is a member of the signal transduction and
activation of RNA (STAR) family of RNA-binding
proteins. Three major QKI isoforms (QKI-5, QKI-6 and
QKI-7), each with a specific carboxy-terminal end, are
produced through alternative splicing both in mouse and
human [14]. QKI-5 contains a nuclear localization signal,
is predominantly localized in the nucleus, and is most
likely to function in pre-mRNA splicing or RNA retention.
In contrast, QKI-6 is localized in both the nucleus and the
cytoplasm, while QKI-7, exclusively cytoplasmic, is proapoptotic [14-16]. QKI behaves as a tumor suppressor
gene (TSG) in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) [17].
QKI, under the direct control of p53 in GBM cells [17], is
also downregulated in gastric and colon cancers [18-19].
In GBM cells, QKI can associate with and stabilize miR20a, thus, increasing miR-20a down-regulatory effects
on TGF-β receptor type II (TGF-βR2), whose activity is
oncogenic in gliomagenesis [17].
As QKI is the first most probable target of miR-155
in apes and human (targetscan.org), and that the expression
of miR-155 is upregulated in glioblastomas [20-21], the
above-mentioned facts suggested that miR-155 might carry
out its oncogenic and pro-inflammatory functions at least
in part by targeting QKI. In the present study, we show that
(i) QKI is indeed a target of miR-155 in B cells; (ii) the
expression of QKI is lower in B-cells from CLL patients
compare to B cells from healthy donors, and acts as TSG
also in CLL; (iii) Qki is a target of LPS signaling, and
its expression is downregulated following LPS challenge
of macrophages; (iv) Qki modulates downstream LPS
signaling in return; particularly p38 MAPK activation and
IL-10 production, thus presenting with anti-inflammatory
properties. We propose that miR-155 and QKI form a
critical regulatory component downstream of TLR4 in
target hematopoietic cells, and that miR-155 exerts its
pro-inflammatory and oncogenic activities at least in part
through the downregulation of QKI expression.

beginning of LPS challenge (data not shown), further
confirming our hypothesis. On Western blots, Qki levels
also decreased significantly only for a short period of time
(data not shown), suggesting that Qki might be a critical
component of LPS signaling, potentially involved in
preventing the initiation of an unnecessary innate immune
response, assuring the robustness of the response at its
onset, and resolving and terminating the response later on.
Our pan-Qki antibody detected one Qki isoform only, and
QKI-5 being the main isoform expressed in hematopoietic
cells [23], this isoform is likely to represent Qki-5.
Accordingly, an antisense miR-155 inhibitory RNA
(155-I) protected Qki transcript from downregulation only
during the first 4 hours of LPS challenge, while remaining
without effects later on (Figure 1D). Altogether, the above
results suggest that, in RAW-264.7 macrophages, Qki
transcripts are potentially targets of miR-155 at the onset
of LPS signaling only.

target of miR-155, we monitored the expression of Qki,
using a probe spanning exons 4 and 5 that recognizes all
Qki isoforms, as well as of miR-155 and Tnf in mouse
RAW-264.7 macrophages following LPS stimulation.
Qki expression decreased 2-fold within 4 hours, while
the expression of miR-155 as well as that of Tnf, both
immediate downstream targets of LPS signaling, increased
significantly (Figure 1A-1C). Beyond 12 hours, Qki
transcripts progressively returned to their initial level at
2-days, while miR-155 level kept increasing. Of note, the
expression of Qki in untreated cells subsequently increased
above its initial level, an effect delayed by roughly
12 hours following LPS challenge (Figure 1A). This
increase was probably related to the surge of cell density,
as previously reported in HT29 colon cancer cells [22].
Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis using oligonucleotides
designed to specifically recognize each of Qki isoforms,
showed that both Qki-5 and Qki-6 are expressed in RAW264.7 cells and their expression is downregulated at the

decreased when U937 cells were first transfected with

fixation of RNA binding proteins on their 3’-UTR, and
that we observed a similar phenomenon in RAW264.7
macrophages, but not in HEK-293 kidney cells (not
shown).

Indeed, the over-expression of QKI-5 doubled the level
of anti-inflammatory IL-10 in cell supernatant (Figure
3A), 24 hours after LPS challenge. In contrast, targeting
Qki transcripts with small interfering RNAs (siQKI),
lead to higher levels of inflammatory IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6
and GM-CSF (Figure 3B). The fact that QKI enhanced
IL-10 production, suggests that its downregulation
during the first hours of LPS challenge is a prerequisite
for the immune response to reach the optimal threshold
level of activation. As LPS binding to TLR4 receptors
triggers the downstream activation of ERK, JNK and
p38 MAPK pathways in responding cells [24], we then
analyzed the effects of QKI on the three above pathways.
Overexpressing QKI impaired the phosphorylation of
p38 and Jnk1/Sapk MAPKs, possibly also slightly the
phosphorylation of Erk1, 2, during the two first hours of
LPS challenge (Figure 3C). In contrast, siQKI respectively
increased p38 phosphorylation by 47% at 0.5-hour (P =
0.0011) and by 177% at 1-hour (P = 0.0789) (Figure 3D),
as determined by scanning the bands on blots representing
three different biological replicates. Noteworthy, QKI

Qki regulates cytokine production and MAPK
phosphorylation
Qki being a target of LPS signaling suggested that
Qki itself might be a modulator of the innate immune
response. We thus transfected RAW-246.7 cells with
a construct expressing QKI-5 (hereafter referred to as
QKI), chosen because: (i) it is the only QKI isoform
that contains a nuclear localization signal and functions
in pre-miRNA splicing and/or RNA retention [15], thus
being the most likely isoform to impact the stability and
processing of immune transcripts; and (ii) QKI-5 is the
main isoform expressed in hematopoietic progenitors and
differentiated cells [23], and our experiments in Figure
1 showed that it is well expressed in RAW-264.7 cells.

overexpression sharply increased the level of total
p38, however only residual amount of this kinase was
phosphorylated (Figure 3C). As the p38 MAPK pathway
is central to the stabilization of many mRNAs encoding
factors implicated in the innate and adaptive immune
responses, including cytokines [24-26], these results
further confirm our hypothesis that the early downregulation of Qki by LPS signaling pathway is needed for
mounting an effective immune response.

QKI and miR-155 expression well discriminate Burkitt’s
cell lines, all with lower miR-155 and higher QKI levels,
from CLL cell lines, all with higher miR-155 but lower
QKI levels (Figure 4A). Accordingly, QKI protein levels
in MEC2, Ado-2199 and WAC CLL cells were lower
than those in PH3R1, EW36 and BJAB cells (Figure
4B). However, QKI levels in MEC1, Daudi and Raji cells
suggest that QKI expression at the protein level is also
regulated by other, non-miR-155-dependent mechanisms.
Nevertheless, miR-155 mimic reduced QKI expression in
BJAB and PH3R1 Burkitt’s cells, but not in MEC2 CLL
cells (Figure 4C). In contrast, transfecting MEC2 cells
with 155-I slightly but significantly increased QKI levels
(Figure 4C). Altogether, these results indicate that QKI is
also a target of miR-155 in B cells.

miR-155 also targets QKI in human leukemic B
lymphocytes
The expression of miR-155 is high in B-CLLderived cell lines as well as in CLL patients [27-30], but
low in B-cell Burkitt’s lymphomas [31]. We found that

control FAS expression in these two types of hematological
malignancies. Finally, siQKI decreased the activity of
Caspases 3/7 in both cell lines (Figure 5E), suggesting that
QKI might act as a TSG also in B cells.

A bioinformatics analysis showed that the 3’-UTR
of FAS transcripts contains the consensus sequence for
QKI binding [32]. siQKI, functional in both MEC2 and
BJAB cell lines (Figure 5A), significantly reduced FAS
levels and the percentage of Fas-expressing cells in both

FAS transcript levels in MEC2 but not BJAB cells (Figure

QKI is downregulated in B cells of CLL patients

Ingenuity software. Expectedly, pathways implicated in
the regulation of lymphocyte differentiation, proliferation,
function and/or signaling were affected in both cell lines
(not shown). However, siQKI had also cell specific
effects (Tables 1 and 2). Of interest, the p38 pathway,
and particularly IRAK3 expression were affected by
siQKI in MEC2 cells (Table 1). This result and those of
Figures 3C, 3D, suggest that p38 pathway is regulated by
QKI in different types of hematopoietic cells. Of note,
30% of the 100 transcripts, most significantly affected
by siQKI in MEC2 cells were predicted targets of miR155 (Supplementary Table 2), versus 23% in BJAB cells
(Supplementary Table 3). Thus, variations in QKI levels
in B cells (Figure 4) are likely to be instrumental in both
Burkitt’s and CLL cell transformation.

QKI being a target of miR-155 at least in certain
conditions, we would expect its expression to be reduced
in leukemias presented with high miR-155 levels, such
as CLL or AML [27-30, 5]. Indeed, the levels of QKI
transcripts were significantly lower in CLL patients
(Figure 6A). In agreement with this result, publicly
available array data show that in both, CLL and AML
patients, the expression of QKI is significantly reduced as
compared with healthy donors (data not shown). Finally,
Qki levels were also lower in B cells of Eµ-miR-155
transgenic mice at the most advanced stage of leukemia
(Figure 6B). These results suggest that the disruption
of cross-regulations between QKI, miR-155 and factors
implicated in the immune response, may generally be
associated with B cell leukemic transformation.

DISCUSSION
We found that Qki levels are reduced at the onset
of immune response to LPS, when miR-155 levels are
on the rise, positioning Qki as an immune factor and
a target of miR-155. In addition, we found that QKI
overexpression increases IL-10 production, as well as
the total amount of p38, while markedly impairing p38
phosphorylation. It is highly probable that following LPS
stimulation, cells sensing the lack of p38 phosphorylation
in the presence of excess QKI increase their levels of
total p38 to compensate for this deficiency. Of note,
K-Ras similarly was previously shown to induce p38
expression but not its phosphorylation, and higher levels
of unphosphorylated p38 promote Ras transformation in
rat intestinal epithelium through an increased complex
formation with Erk-1, -2 kinases [33]. As the reduction of
Qki levels only took place at the first hours of the immune
response, we hypothesize that miR-155 targeting of Qki is
restricted only at the beginning of the response, to allow
p38 MAPK required activation following LPS challenge.
It is thus very likely that during the first hours of LPS
signaling, dose-dependent effects take place between Qki,
miR-155 and MAPKs activity, paralleling the oscillatory
activity of “early” genes, such as NF-κB and AP-1 activity
[34]. Similarly, low miR-155 expression at the early phase
of dendritic cells maturation enables the activation of the
p38 pathway, thus favoring IL-1 expression and signaling
cascade [35].
Later on, the miR-155 targeting of Qki transcript was
impaired. This might be due to the fact that proliferating
cells, including human monocytes stimulated with LPS
and IFNγ, tend to express mRNAs with shortened 3’UTR and consequently fewer miRNA target sites [36].
Alternatively, Qki 3’-UTR might act as a sponge for miR155. Finally, miR-155 overexpression in MCF7 breast
cancer cells increases the levels of some of its target

transcripts through the progressive shortening of their 3’UTR, including p38 MAPK [37].
Our results show that QKI overexpression increased
IL-10 expression and affected p38 MAPK, while siQKI
modulated the expression of IRAK3, a negative regulator
of TLR signaling, including p38 MAPK [38]. Altogether,
these results suggest that QKI, miR-155, p38 and IL-10
[39] are involved in a common regulatory circuitry in
B cells and macrophages, and that QKI may represent
a new factor of hematopoietic cell transformation. This
hypothesis is also supported by previous findings showing
that the expression of QKI isoforms, changes significantly
during hematopoietic differentiation, suggesting for a
critical role of QKI in hematopoiesis and function [23].
Our results further show an inverse correlation
between QKI and miR-155 expression in CLL and
Burkitt’s cell lines, and establish that QKI might render
B cells prone to cell death by increasing Caspase3/7
signaling and FAS expression, suggesting that QKI may
behave as a TSG in B cells. Importantly, QKI expression
was low in CLL patients, known to have high levels of
miR-155 [27-30], as well as in leukemic B cells isolated
from the spleens of Eµ-miR-155 mice, results further
supported by data available in public databases.
Finally, QKI unusually long 3’-UTR contains
target sites for most miRNAs (targetscan.org). Thus, QKI
may represents a regulatory hub directing many cellular
processes. As human QKI 3’-UTR contains three miR-155
target site, the third one being present only in apes, where
QKI came to represent the first most probable target of
miR-155, one can expect miR-155 - QKI cross-regulatory
interactions to have gained a critical importance in this
group.
Mice with spontaneous deletion of Qki have marked
rapid tremor and seizures, and their entire central nervous
system is severely depleted in myelin [40]. As miR-155
expression is elevated in neuro-inflammatory pathologies
such as MS or ALS [41, 42], our data further suggest that
a lack of QKI anti-inflammatory input may result in the
deleterious dominance of miR-155 activity, therefore,
miR-155-QKI interactions could prove to be significantly
important for future therapies aimed at neuro-degenerative
pathologies presented with high levels of miR-155.
In conclusion, while miR-155 is critical for
mounting an effective immune response, its prolonged
expression under chronic inflammatory conditions drives
immune pathologies and leukemias. Therefore, a better
understanding of miR-155/QKI functions and their control
of expression in immune cells should allow to design new
miR-155-based cancer immunotherapies. Our findings
suggest that when QKI-miR-155 reciprocal regulation
becomes dysfunctional, enhanced miR-155 activity drives
tumor development and evasion of the immune response.

Affymetrix microarray (Santa Clara, CA, USA)
analyses were submitted to the MIAME database
(accession number E-MTAB-2375). Purified CD19+
B cells were purchased from Sanguine BioSciences
(Sherman Oaks, CA, USA). Eμ-miR-155 transgenic
mice were previously described [6]. B cells from mice
were isolated using B-cell purification kit from Miltenyi
Biotech (San Diego, CA, USA).
Cells were grown following standard procedures.
Information for miRNAs and siRNAs is found in
Supplementary Table 1. The fragments of QKI 3’UTR
and the Luciferase reporter construct containing the
promoter of QKI gene were purchased from SwitchGear.
Each miR-155 site was subsequently mutated using the
Quick-Exchange Mutagenesis kit (Agilent; Santa Clara,
CA, USA). Human QKI-5 cDNA was purchased from
Genecopeia (Rockville, MD, USA) and recloned into the
pCMV-HA expression vector.
Luciferase assays were run 48 hours after
transfection as previously described [43]. CaspaseGlo 3/7 kit (Promega; Madison, WI, USA) was used to
measure cell death. The assays were performed three
times in quadruplicate, and the mean ± S.D. of caspase
3/7 activation (expressed as arbitrary units) is shown.
RNAs were extracted either with TRIzol (Life
Technologies) or the RNA purification kit from Norgen
(Thorold, ON, Canada). They were subsequently subjected
to DNase digestion (Turbo-DNase- Life Technologies).
MiRNA and gene qRT-PCRs were respectively performed
using the corresponding Assays from Life Technologies
(Supplementary Table 1). RT-PCRs were run in triplicates.
Values were normalized using one of the following
normalizers: RNU-44, RNU-48, RNU-6B or U6 for
MiRNA assays and OAZ1, β-Actin or GAPDH for Gene
Expression assays.
Antibodies and other related information are listed
in Supplementary Table 1. Flow cytometry staining was
done following standard procedures and run on a Calibur
(BD-Biosciences) machine. The data were analyzed
using FloJow (Ashland, OR, USA) software. Cytokine
production was measured using the ELISA kit (Qiagen)
following manufacturer’s instruction. Statistical analysis
were done using the Student t test, and P values are
provided in the Figure legends.
