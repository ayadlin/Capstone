ABSTRACT
The antitumor enzyme asparaginase, which targets essential amino acid L-asparagine
and catalyzes it to L-aspartic acid and ammonia, has been used for years in the treatment
of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), subtypes of myeloid leukemia and T-cell
lymphomas, whereas the anti-chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) effect of asparaginase
and its underlying mechanism has not been completely elucidated. We have shown here
that asparaginase induced significant growth inhibition and apoptosis in K562 and KU812
cells. Apart from induction of apoptosis, we reported for the first time that asparaginase
induced autophagic response in K562 and KU812 cells as evidenced by the formation of
autophagosome, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)-positive autophagylike vacuoles, and the upregulation of LC3-II. Further study suggested that the Akt/mTOR
(mammalian target of rapamycin) and Erk (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) signaling
pathway were involved in asparaginase-induced autophagy in K562 cells. Moreover,
blocking autophagy using pharmacological inhibitors LY294002, chloroquine (CQ) and
quinacrine (QN) enhanced asparaginase-induced cell death and apoptosis, indicating the
cytoprotective role of autophagy in asparaginase-treated K562 and KU812 cells. Together,
these findings provide a rationale that combination of asparaginase anticancer activity
and autophagic inhibition might be a promising new therapeutic strategy for CML.

Targeting amino acid metabolism has been
safely and effectively employed for tumor therapy [6].
Asparaginase, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved enzyme therapeutics for cancer therapy, has
been used to treat ALL since the early 1970s and induces
a 60% of complete remission (CR) rate as a monotherapy
[7]. Tumor cells, more specifically leukemia cells,
require huge amounts of asparagine to keep up with
their rapid malignant growth. Therefore L-asparagine is
an essential amino acid for the growth of tumor cells,
whereas the growth of normal cells is not dependent
on its requirement as it can be synthesized in amounts
sufficient for their metabolic needs with their own enzyme
L-asparagine synthetase (ASNS) [8, 9]. The presence
of therapeutic asparaginase deprives tumor cells of an
important growth factor by hydrolyzing L-asparagine

INTRODUCTION
CML is a myeloproliferative neoplasm with an
incidence of 1–2 cases per 100,000 adults, and accounts for
~15% of newly diagnosed cases of leukemia in adults. A
significant percentage of the patients with CML failed to
respond effectively to the current regimen of drug therapy
including frontline tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
therapy, and had to be considered for allogeneic stem cell
transplantation (AlloSCT) which has a high risk of morbidity
and mortality [1–3]. The prevalence of CML represents a
considerable burden on patients and the healthcare systems
in regard to drug availability, potential development of longterm side effects, and costs [4, 5]. Therefore, it is critical to
continue research into novel therapeutic approaches.

into L-aspartic acid and ammonia, afterwards tumor cells
fail to survive because of their reduced ASNS levels
[10]. Asparaginase could also deprive L-glutamine,
which is a precursor of L-asparagine, thereby producing
L-glutamic acid and ammonia [10]. Although primarily
used as a chemotherapeutic agent against ALL [11, 12],
asparaginase is also used in other types of leukemia such
as non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma [13], subtypes of myelocytic
leukemia [14] and chronic lymphocytic leukemia,
sarcomas such as lymphosarcoma, reticulosarcoma and
melanosarcoma [15], ovarian cancer [16] and brain cancer
[6] with a potential role for its glutaminase activity [10].
One of the key cellular responses to nutrient
withdrawal is the upregulation of autophagy [17], and
mounting evidence suggest that amino-acid depletion could
concurrently induce autophagy and apoptosis [18–21].
Autophagy is a cellular catabolic process that contributes
to quality control and maintenance of the cellular energetic
balance through the turnover of proteins and organelles in
lysosomes, and takes place at basal levels in most of the cell
types but is also regulated by environmental stimuli [22]. In
fact, autophagy is a process by which cells can adapt their
metabolism to starvation caused by a decrease in metabolite
concentrations or extracellular nutrients allowing cells to
evade programmed cell death [23]. Accordingly, inhibition
of autophagy results in cell death of growth factor-starved
cells [24]. In tumors displaying defective apoptosis,
inhibition of autophagy causes caspase-independent
necrotic cell death, which, in turn, augments inflammation,
leading to enhanced tumor burden [25, 26].
Recent study showed that L-asparaginase inhibited
mTORC1, and induced apoptosis as well as autophagic
process in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells [14].
Autophagy was also observed in ovarian cancer cell exposed
to asparaginase at physiologically attainable concentrations
with induction of ATG12, beclin-1, and cleavage of LC3
[27]. It has been reported that autophagy plays an important
role in CML tumourgenesis, progression and therapy [28].
Imatinib mesylate (IM), a TKI as the first-line therapy
for patients with CML, could induce autophagy in CML
cells, and autophagy inhibitors enhanced the therapeutic
effects of TKIs in the treatment of CML [28, 29]. Despite
of these advances, there has been few investigation on
targeting asparagine metabolism in CML therapy. Whether
asparaginase could induce autophagy and apoptosis, and the
relationship between them in CML cells remain unknown.
In this study, we report that asparaginase induces
obvious growth inhibition and apoptosis in CML cells.
Meanwhile, apoptosis is not the sole consequence
of asparagine deprivation, as asparaginase treatment
rapidly activates an autophagic process by inducing the
conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II. In addition, the Akt/mTOR
(mammalian target of rapamycin) and Erk (extracellular
signal-regulated kinase) signaling pathway are involved in
asparaginase-induced autophagy in K562 cells. Of greater
importance, inhibition of autophagy by pharmacological
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inhibitors enhances asparaginase-induced cell death in
CML cells. These findings indicate that autophagy provides
a cytoprotective mechanism in CML cells treated by
asparaginase, and inhibition of autophagy may improve
the therapeutic efficacy of asparaginase in the treatment of
CML. Taken together, these results suggest that combination
of asparaginase anticancer activity and autophagic inhibition
might be a promising new therapeutic strategy for CML.

RESULTS
Asparaginase induces growth inhibition and
apoptosis in K562 and KU812 CML cells
Firstly, we determined the growth inhibitory effect of
asparaginase in K562 and KU812 cells. As shown in Figure
1A and Supplementary Figure 1A, asparaginase reduced
cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In
addition, treatment of K562 and KU812 cells with different
concentrations of asparaginase for 48 h increased the
percentage of apoptotic cells (Figure 1B and Supplementary
Figure 1B, 1C). Meanwhile, western blot analysis illustrated
that the level of cleaved-caspase 3 and cleaved-PARP
increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner, indicating
the apoptosis was induced by asparaginase in K562 and
KU812 cells (Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure 1D).
Secondly, the effect of asparaginase in K562 cell
cycle distribution was performed by FACS analysis after
stained with PI. As shown in Figure 1D and 1E, the cells
at sub-G1 phase in these asparaginase-treated groups
significantly increased when compared with negative
controls, indicating that asparaginase could induce cell
death in K562 cells. In addition, upon the asparaginase
treatment, the cells at G1 phase increased with reduced
cells at S phase when compared with negative controls,
indicating that asparaginase could induce G1 arrest to
decelerate the cell cycle, and prevent the cells from
entering the S phase and proliferating. Furthermore,
western blot analysis revealed a gradual reduction of
Cyclin D in a time- and dose-dependent manner in K562
cells after asparaginase treatment (Figure 1F). Cyclin D is a
cell cycle regulator essential for G1 phase, and expression
of Cyclin D correlate closely with development and
prognosis of cancers [30, 31]. Thus, reduction of Cyclin D
indicates cell cycle arrest and cell growth inhibition.
These results demonstrate that asparaginase induces
growth inhibition and apoptosis in K562 and KU812 CML
cells.

dose- and time-dependent manner (Figure 2A). To further
demonstrate whether asparaginase-induced apoptosis in
K562 cells was correlated to the activation of caspase
3, a pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl Val-AlaAsp (O-methyl)-fluoro-methylketone (z-VAD-fmk) was
employed. The results showed that 20 μM of z-VADfmk could significantly decrease the level of cleavedcaspase 3 (Figure 2B). In addition, when asparaginase
was combined with the treatment of z-VAD-fmk, the
level of cleaved-PARP (Figure 2B), the percentage of
growth inhibition (Figure 2C) and apoptotic cells (Figure
2D and Figure 2E) were significantly decreased.
These results reveal that asparaginase-induced
apoptosis in K562 CML cells partially depends on caspase
3 activation.

were used to detect autophagosome formation. First of
all, we investigated the number of autophagic vacuoles
presenting in cells through transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) analysis. Increasing accumulation
of double-membrane-enclosed autophagosome was
observed in cells after 24 h-asparaginase treatment,
whereas no autophagosome was found in untreated
control cells (Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure 2A).
Next, we used a Cyto-ID Green dye autophagy detection
kit to detect LC3-II, the protein bound on the membrane
of autophagosomes with fluorescence microscopy. After
treatment with 0.5 IU/mL asparaginase for 24 h, K562
and KU812 cells displayed more green fluorescence
than that in the negative controls which showed limited
specific fluorescence. Meanwhile, the positive controls,
cells treated with 50 nM Rapamycin, exhibited significant
green fluorescence (Figure 3B and Supplementary
Figure 2B). Finally, we examined the conversion of
LC3, also known as ATG8, to assess autophagy levels
in asparaginase-treated K562 and KU812 cells through
western blot analysis. Autophagosome formation is
invariably associated with conversion of LC3 from the
cytosolic LC3-I to the autophagosome-associated LC3-II

form. Figure 3C and Supplementary Figure 2C showed
the appearance of LC3-II in the cells treated with 0.125
IU/mL of asparaginase, and an obvious conversion
of endogenous LC3-I to LC3-II in a dose-dependent
manner. Moreover, Figure 3D and Supplementary
Figure 2D revealed that the accumulation of LC3-II in
protein extracts of 0.5 IU/mL asparaginase treated cells
gradually increased with the extension of time, indicating
autophagosome formation.
These observations strongly suggest that autophagy
is induced in K562 and KU812 CML cells after
asparaginase treatment.

Several studies have suggested that autophagy
may act as a protective mechanism in tumor cells and
that therapy-induced cell death can be enhanced upon
autophagy inhibition [24, 32, 33]. To test whether
autophagy acts as a cytoprotective mechanism in our
system, we inhibited autophagy in CML cells using
LY294002, chloroquine (CQ) and quinacrine (QN)
[34, 35], and analyzed the effects on the level of

LC3-II and asparaginase-induced cell death. LY294002
is an inhibitor of PI3K, which inhibits autophagosomes
accumulation and inhibits the conversion of LC3-I to
LC3-II. However CQ and QN, two lysosome inhibitors,
could lead to the aggregation of autophagosomes
and increase LC3-II level by blocking the fusion of
autophagosomes and lysosomes. Western blot analysis
indicated that asparaginase-induced autophagy was
successfully inhibited by LY294002, CQ and QN
(Figure 4A and Supplementary Figures 3A, 4A).
Compared with K562 and KU812 cells that incubated
with asparaginase, treatment with LY294002, CQ or QN
significantly increased asparaginase-induced cytotoxicity
in K562 and KU812 cells (Figure 4B and Supplementary
Figures 3B, 4B). Direct observations through microscope
showed that asparaginase in combination with LY294002,
CQ or QN induced more obvious morphology changes
including cell shrinkage, fragmentation, and death when
compared with asparaginase-treated alone (Figure 4C and
Supplementary Figures 3C, 4C). To further understand the
biological role of autophagy in asparaginase-induced cell
death, we examined the changes of asparaginase-induced
apoptosis. The results demonstrated that asparaginase
in combination with LY294002, CQ or QN induced a
higher percentage of apoptotic cells (Figure 4D, 4E and
Supplementary Figures 3D, 3E, 4D, 4E) and more cleavage
of caspase 3 and PARP (Figure 4F and Supplementary
Figures 3F, 4F) when compared with asparaginase-treated
alone, whereas cells treatment with LY294002, CQ and
QN alone showed limited apoptosis-inducing effects on
K562 and KU812 cells.
These results reveal that inhibition of autophagy
enhances asparaginase-induced growth inhibition,
morphology changes and apoptosis, indicating that
autophagy plays a cytoprotective role in asparaginaseinduced cell death in K562 and KU812 CML cells.

showed that asparaginase decreased the phosphorylation
of mTOR in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Then
we evaluated the expression of phosphorylation of Akt,
an upstream inducer of mTOR. After dose- and timedependently incubated with asparaginase, the level
of phosphorylation of Akt significantly decreased.
Furthermore, three downstream substrates of mTOR,
p70S6K, 4E-BP1 and S6, showed significant decreases in
phosphorylation (Figure 5A, 5B, 5C, and 5D).
Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk1/2) has
been shown to regulate expression of autophagy and
lysosomal genes, and stimulate autophagy by interacting
with LC3 [38, 39]. Recent studies have demonstrated new
unconventional functions of autophagy (ATG) proteins
and LC3-II in the upregulation of Erk phosphorylation
[40]. In this study, an increased level of Erk1/2
phosphorylation (p-Erk1/2-T202/Y204) was observed in
a dose- and time-dependent manner in K562 cells treated
with different concentrations of asparaginase for 24 h
(Figure 5E) or with 0.5 IU/mL of asparaginase for 3, 6,
12 and 24 h (Figure 5F). To further investigate the role
of Erk1/2 in autophagy induced by asparaginase, U0126
(Erk phosphorylation inhibitor) was employed to block the
phosphorylation of Erk1/2. Figure 5G revealed that the
level of LC3-II as well as p-Erk1/2-T202/Y204 decreased
in K562 cells after exposure to 0.5 IU/mL of asparaginase
and 20 μM of U0126 for 24 h, indicating that autophagy
was suppressed by inhibiting the phosphorylation of Erk.
These experiments suggest that the Akt/mTOR and
Erk signaling pathway are involved in autophagy induced
by asparaginase in K562 CML cells.

DISCUSSION
CML is a myeloproliferative disease, which has high
morbidity and mortality in human beings [1]. The TKIs are
highly effective in CML treatment, while a problem that
may arise due to the widespread use of TKIs is increased
drug resistance [41]. Therefore, it is necessary to find novel
therapeutic approaches to overcome this problem. The
targeting of metabolic processes has revealed as a promising
approach to cancer therapy. Asparaginase, a FDA-approved
enzyme, is a cornerstone in the multi-drug treatment of
childhood ALL and has been used for over 40 years [7,
42]. However, the anti-CML effect of asparaginase and its
underlying mechanism has not been completely elucidated.
In this study, we observed that asparaginase induced growth
inhibition and apoptosis in K562 and KU812 cells. Further
study illustrated that asparaginase-induced apoptosis was
partially caspase 3-dependent in K562 cells. , indicating
one of the underlying mechanisms of anti-CML effect of
asparaginase was the induction of apoptosis.
It has been well demonstrated that amino-acid
depletion can induce autophagy [18, 21]. Previous research
showed that L-asparaginase inhibited mTORC1 through
its glutaminase activity and induced apoptosis as well as

The Akt/mTOR and Erk signaling pathway are
involved in autophagy induced by asparaginase
in K562 CML cells
The Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is one of the
major pathways regulating autophagy in eukaryotic cells.
Nutrient starvation induces autophagy in eukaryotic cells
through inhibition of mTOR, a major negative regulator of
autophagy [36]. mTOR can be phosphorylated (at serine
2448) by phosphorylated(p)-Akt-serine(S)473 to form
p-mTOR-S2448 which inhibits the induction of autophagy
[37]. mTOR positively regulates protein translation
through the phosphorylation of its substrates, protein S6
Kinase (p70S6K), eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding
protein 1 (4E-BP1) and S6 ribosomal protein (S6) [22].
In this study, to confirm whether Akt/mTOR pathway
was involved in autophagy induced by asparaginase, we
firstly evaluated the level of phosphorylated mTOR in
asparaginase-treated K562 cells. Western blot analysis

a strong autophagic process in AML cells [14]. Autophagy
was also investigated in ovarian cancer cells upon
asparaginase treatment [27]. In this study, we could not help
asking whether asparaginase induced autophagy in CML
cells? Three well-established methods were used to detect
autophagosome formation. We observed asparaginaseinduced autophagic response in K562 and KU812 cells
as evidenced by the formation of autophagosome through
TEM, LC3-positive autophagy-like vacuoles through CytoID Green dye, and the increased conversion of LC3-I to
LC3-II through western blot analysis.
Whether autophagy promotes cell death or
enhances survival is still controversial [43, 44]. Although
drug-induced autophagic tumor cell death has been
reported [45–47], results from most studies support the
survival role of autophagy in chemotherapy-induced
cell death [19, 20, 25, 26]. The explanation for the
complex process is thought to be specific to cell types,
phases, genetic background and microenvironment [48].
What would be the role of autophagy in asparaginasetreated K562 and KU812 cells? To directly clarify
this question, we inhibited asparaginase-induced
autophagy pharmacologically by using LY294002,
CQ and QN in K562 and KU812 cells. We found that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

asparaginase-induced cell death significantly increased
by additional treatment with LY294002, CQ and QN.
Moreover, microscope analysis showed that asparaginase
in combination with LY294002, CQ or QN induced
more obvious morphology changes including cell
shrinkage, fragmentation, and death when compared
with asparaginase-treated alone. Indicating asparaginaseinduced autophagy might play a cytoprotective role
in K562 and KU812 cells. To further confirm the
cytoprotective role of autophagy induced by asparaginase
in K562 and KU812 cells, we detected apoptosis in
K562 and KU812 cells when cells were treated with
asparaginase and autophagy inhibitors. Remarkably,
LY294002, CQ and QN treatment enhanced asparaginaseinduced apoptosis as evidenced by increased Annexin
V-positive/PI-negative cells, caspase-3 cleavage, and
PARP cleavage. All of these results demonstrated that
asparaginase-induced autophagy played a cytoprotective
role in K562 and KU812 cells. Blocking autophagy could
enhance the efficacy of asparaginase on K562 and KU812
cells and this might be a promising new therapeutic
strategy for CML. In our recent studies, arginase,
another amnio acid-degrading enzyme, was found to
induce apoptosis and cytoprotective autophagy in non3868

Hodgkin’s lymphoma and melanoma, and inhibition of
autophagy was demonstrated to enhance the antitumor
effect of arginase [19, 20]. All our studies elucidated that
autophagy induced by deprivation of essential amino
acid played a cytoprotective role in malignant cancers,
and inhibition of autophagy could enhance the antitumor
efficacy of therapeutic enzyme.
Erk controls various aspects of cell physiology
including autophagy. It has been shown that growth factor
increases the interaction of Erk cascade components with
autophagy proteins in both cytosol and nucleus [40].
Akt/mTOR signaling is another pathway to regulated
autophagy. Akt negatively regulates autophagy via
activation of mTOR, which inhibits multiple autophagypromoting proteins via phosphorylation [26, 49]. In
this study, we showed that upon asparaginase treatment

mTOR phosphorylation, as well as the phosphorylation

mTOR signaling pathway was involved in asparaginaseinduced autophagy in K562 cells. Whereas the same
treatment showed increasement of Erk phosphorylation
(p-Erk1/2-T202/Y204) through western blot analysis.
We further confirmed the role of Erk pathway by using
Erk phosphorylation inhibitor U0126. We found that
inhibition of Erk phosphorylation downregulated the
LC3 II level, thereby inhibiting autophagy. These results
indicated that both Akt/mTOR and Erk signaling pathway
were involved in autophagy induced by asparaginase in
K562 CML cells.

Asparagine is required by all cells for survival and
is normally produced by ASNS [8]. Asparaginase-sensitive
malignant tumor cells are thought to express relatively
low levels of ASNS and thus depend on the available of
extracellular asparagine for their survival [9]. However,
recent study showed that asparaginase exhibited significant
cytotoxicity of ASNS-positive cancer cells including
K562, SR leukemia cells, and this anticancer activity
might due to the glutaminase activity of asparaginase [50].
In conclusion, the present study proved that
asparaginase could induce autophagy and apoptosis in
K562 and KU812 CML cells, and autophagy induced by
asparaginase played a cytoprotective role. Inhibition of
autophagy by the autophagy inhibitors LY294002, CQ
and QN could significantly enhance growth inhibition and
cell apoptosis in K562 and KU812 cells. Furthermore, our
results suggested that the Akt/mTOR and Erk pathway
were involved in asparaginase-induced autophagy in
K562 cells (Scheme 1). Our research highlighted that
combination of asparaginase and autophagic inhibition
might be a promising new therapeutic strategy for CML.

(Danvers, MA, USA). The secondary antibodies
horseradish peroxidases (HRP)-conjugated goat antimouse and anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G were purchased
from MR Biotech (Shanghai, China).

Buffer (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Haimen,
China), and kept on ice for at least 30 min. The lysates
were centrifuged at 12,000g at 4°C for 10 min, then the
supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube. After protein
concentration was measured by the bicinchoninic acid
(BCA) method, an equal quantity of total protein per lane
was separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to
polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. Membranes
were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA)
powder in 0.05% Tris-buffered saline and Tween 20
(TBST) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated
overnight at 4°C with specialized antibodies. After
overnight incubation, membranes were washed for three
times and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Detection
was performed with enhanced chemiluminescence
reagents (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Intensities in the
resulting bands were quantified by IQuantTL software (GE
Healthcare, USA).

Apoptosis assay
Annexin V-FITC/PI Detection Kit (BD Biosciences,
San Diego, CA, USA) and Annexin V-FITC/PE Detection
Kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Haimen,
Jiangsu Province, China) were used for the determination
of cell apoptosis. K562 and KU812 cells were exposed
to asparaginase with or without autophagy inhibitors for
48 h, then harvested and washed twice with cold PBS,
and re-suspended in 1× binding buffer at a concentration
of 1 × 106 cells/mL. Subsequently, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions, the cells were stained with
annexin V-FITC and PI/PE for 15 min at 37°C. Then, the
cells were analyzed immediately by using a FACS Calibur
flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, Fullerton, CA, USA).

Cell culture
Human CML cell line K562 and KU812 were
purchased from Cell Bank of Chinese Academy of
Sciences, Shanghai Branch (Shanghai, China). K562 cells
were cultured in RPMI-1640 containing 10% of heatinactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), and KU812 cells
were maintained in IMDM medium with 15% FBS. All
the medium were containing 100 U/mL of penicillin and
100 μg/mL of streptomycin. The cells were grown at 37°C
in a 5% CO2 atmosphere incubator.

Cell cycle analysis
The effect of asparaginase on K562 cell cycle
distribution was determined by FACS Calibur flow
cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, Fullerton, CA, USA)
analysis. After incubation with 0.02, 0.1, and 0.5 IU/mL
of asparaginase for 48 h, K562 cells were fixed in 70%
ethanol at the temperature of -20°C for overnight, washed
twice with cold PBS, and stained with PI and RNaseA
at 4°C for 30 min. Then, the samples were analyzed by
FACS Calibur flow cytometer.

Cell viability assay
Cell viability was measured by the MTT cytotoxicity
assay. About 1 × 104 cells were seeded in 96-well plates
and then incubated with different dilutions of asparaginase
with or without autophagy inhibitors. After treatment
for 48 h, cells were incubated with 0.5 mg/mL of MTT
for 4 h at 37°C. Then, 100 mL of 20% SDS in dimethyl
formamide/H2O (1 : 1, v/v; pH 4.7) was added to each
well, and dissolved formazan to solution for measurement.
The optical density (OD) was measured at an absorbance
wavelength of 570 nm.

Transmission electron microscopy analysis
TEM assays were performed as described in
our previous study [25]. K562 and KU812 cells were
incubated with 0.5 IU/mL of asparaginase for 24 h, then
harvested and fixed with ice-cold glutaraldehyde. Samples
were detected with a JEM 1410 transmission electron
microscope (JEOL, Inc., USA) at 80 kV.

Western blot analysis
For western blot, K562 and KU812 cells were
harvested and washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS). The proteins were extracted with RIPA Cell Lysis
