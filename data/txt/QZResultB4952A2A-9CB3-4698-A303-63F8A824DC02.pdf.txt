Abstract
RAD51 is the central protein that catalyzes DNA repair via homologous recombination, a process that ensures
genomic stability. RAD51 protein is commonly expressed at high levels in cancer cells relative to their noncancerous
precursors. High levels of RAD51 expression can lead to the formation of genotoxic RAD51 protein complexes on
undamaged chromatin. We developed a therapeutic approach that exploits this potentially toxic feature of
malignancy, using compounds that stimulate the DNA-binding activity of RAD51 to promote cancer cell death. A
panel of immortalized cell lines was challenged with the RAD51-stimulatory compound RS-1. Resistance to RS-1
tended to occur in cells with higher levels of RAD54L and RAD54B, which are Swi2/Snf2-related translocases
known to dissociate RAD51 ﬁlaments from dsDNA. In PC3 prostate cancer cells, RS-1–induced lethality was
accompanied by the formation of microscopically visible RAD51 nuclear protein foci occurring in the absence of any
DNA-damaging treatment. Treatment with RS-1 promoted signiﬁcant antitumor responses in a mouse model,
providing proof-of-principle for this novel therapeutic strategy. Cancer Res; 74(13); 3546–55. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Homologous recombination is an essential process that
serves multiple roles including the repair of DNA doublestrand breaks (DSB). Homologous recombination utilizes an
undamaged sister chromatid as a template to guide the repair
of DSBs, thereby leading to error-free repair. Homologous
recombination also promotes cellular recovery from replication-blocking lesions or collapsed replication forks. Because of
these repair activities, cells that harbor homologous recombination defects exhibit profound sensitivities to several classes
of chemotherapeutics including PARP inhibitors and interstrand DNA cross-linkers that interfere with DNA replication
or replication-associated DNA repair (1–3).
RAD51 is a highly conserved protein that is central to
homologous recombination. Homologous recombination

events involve 50 to 30 nuclease processing of DNA ends that
generates 30 ssDNA tails at the sites of damaged DNA. These
tracks of ssDNA rapidly become coated by ssDNA-binding
protein RPA. RPA is ultimately displaced from the ssDNA by
oligomerization of RAD51 protein on ssDNA, wherein promoters of RAD51 oligomerize into a helical, right-handed nucleoprotein ﬁlament. The ability of RAD51 to displace RPA on
ssDNA in cells requires several mediator proteins, which
include BRCA2, RAD52, the RAD51 paralog complexes, and
other proteins (4). Cells that harbor defects in mediator
proteins exhibit low homologous recombination efﬁciency,
and the overexpression of RAD51 protein can partially circumvent deﬁcient mediator functions (3, 5–7).
Overexpression of RAD51 to modestly elevated levels can
stimulate homologous recombination activity, at least in some
systems (8–11). In contrast, RAD51 overexpression to high
levels results in lower homologous recombination efﬁciency
and reduced viability (5, 12, 13). For example, RAD51 protein
expression was experimentally increased by >10-fold using
HT1080 cells that carry a repressible RAD51 transgene, and
this resulted in slower growth rate, G2 arrest, and apoptosis
(13). In another example, forced overexpression of RAD51 led
to the formation of aberrant homology-mediated repair products and chromosomal translocations (14).
Under the normal conditions of proper homologous recombination repair, RAD51 is known to accumulate into subnuclear foci at sites of ssDNA that are undergoing repair (15, 16).
However, some human cancer cell lines that overexpress
RAD51 to very high levels exhibit nuclear foci of RAD51 in the
absence of exogenous DNA damage, while such nondamageinduced foci are far less prominent in nonmalignant cells (17).
Therefore, the toxicity associated with very high levels of

RAD51-Stimulatory Compound Kills Malignant Cells

RAD51 expression may be related to RAD51 complexes that
accumulate on undamaged dsDNA (18). These damage-independent RAD51 complexes can be ameliorated, at least in part,
by Swi2/Snf2-related translocases. For example, yeast Rad54
protein was shown to dissociate RAD51 nucleoprotein ﬁlaments formed on dsDNA in biochemical systems (19). Additional work in yeast has demonstrated that RAD51 accumulates spontaneously on chromatin when a set of three partially
redundant DNA translocases (Rad54, Rdh54, or Uls1) are
absent. This cytologic observation coincides with slower cell
growth and elevated genomic instability (18). Translocase
depletion can also result in accumulation of nondamageassociated RAD51 complexes bound to DNA in human tumor
cells (20). Therefore, the propensity for cancer cells to form
toxic RAD51 complexes likely reﬂects an imbalance between
RAD51 protein concentration and the combined activities of
RAD54 family translocases.
These ﬁndings have important implications to human malignancies because RAD51 protein is commonly overexpressed in
human cancers (21). This overexpression seems largely due to
transcriptional upregulation, given that the RAD51 promoter is
activated an average of 840-fold (with a maximum difference of
12,500-fold) in a wide range of cancer cell lines, relative to
normal human ﬁbroblasts (22). Human tumors with the highest
levels of RAD51 overexpression tend to exhibit aggressive
pathologic features (23, 24), and patients accordingly experience
relatively poor outcomes (25–27). Taken together, RAD51 overexpression may be a common mechanism leading to genomic
instability, which in turn fuels malignant progression of human
cancers. Analysis of tumor cells containing high levels of nondamage-associated RAD51 complexes indicates that defects in
chromosome segregation underlie this instability (20).
We have explored a novel therapeutic strategy that exploits
the high levels of RAD51 overexpression that occur in human
cancers. Because malignant cells are already susceptible to
forming RAD51 complexes on undamaged chromatin, our
strategy makes use of agents that can further increase this
toxic effect. We made use of the RAD51-stimulatory compound
RS-1, which increases the DNA-binding activity of RAD51 (28).
We show here that RS-1 can be used to kill human cancer cells,
and that its toxicity is modulated by both RAD51 and RAD54
translocase expression levels.

Materials and Methods
Compound preparation
RS-1 (3-(N-benzylsulfamoyl)-4-bromo-N-(4-bromophenylbenzamide) was synthesized in our laboratories, using methods
described in the Supplementary Materials.
Knockdown of RAD51, RAD54L, and RAD54B
The RAD51 siRNA and the All-Stars negative control siRNA
(NS) were ordered from Qiagen. RAD54B siRNAs were ordered
from Invitrogen (Stealth). The RAD54L siRNA cocktail was
ordered from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-36362). All siRNAs
were transfected using RNAiMax as per manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Brieﬂy, 2.0  105 cells were plated in 6-well
dishes containing siRNA complexes to achieve the desired ﬁnal
concentration of siRNAs. The RAD54B and RAD54L siRNAs

www.aacrjournals.org

consisted of a cocktail of three independent siRNAs. The
concentration of siRNAs transfected was 25 nmol/L for RAD54L
and 50 nmol/L RAD54B. Codepletion of RAD54L and RAD54B
was performed by transfecting cells simultaneously with both
siRNAs. At 48 hours posttransfection, cells were harvested for
cell survival assays and Western blotting as described.
The target sequences for siRNA depletion are as follows:

RAD54L-B 50 CCGTAGCAGTGACAAAGTA
RAD54L-C 50 GAACCCAGCCAATGATGAA
Western blotting
Whole-cell protein extracts were separated via SDS-PAGE
and subjected to Western blotting. Primary antibodies included
protein A puriﬁed rabbit anti HsRAD51 (1:1000 dilution, gift
of Akira Shinohara, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan), RAD54L
antibody (1:1000 dilution, 4E3/1 from Abcam), RAD54B antibody (1:1000 dilution, PA529881 from Thermo Scientiﬁc), and
mouse anti-a-tubulin (1:5000 dilution, Ab-2 from Fitzgerald).
Secondary antibodies consisted of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:1,000 dilution; GE Healthcare) and
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:2,000
dilution; GE Healthcare).
Cell lines
PC3, LNCap, DU 145, COLO 205, MCF-7, HEK-293, U2OS, and
MDA-MB-231 cells are routinely grown in our laboratories.
HT1080 cells carrying a doxycycline-repressible RAD51 transgene were received from Jennifer Flygare (Karolinska Institute,
Stockholm, Sweden). All of these cell lines were recently
authenticated by short tandem repeat proﬁling at the Genetic
Resources Core Facility at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine
(Baltimore, MD).
Cell survival assays
Cells were plated into 96-well tissue culture plates at a
density of 300 cells per well in the presence or absence of
RS-1 for 24 hours at 37 C, 5% CO2. RS-1 was then removed, and
cultures were allowed to grow for approximately one week to a
50% to 70% conﬂuence. Average survival from six replicates
was measured using CellGlo reagent (Promega), and error bars
represent the SE.
Microscopy to detect protein localization
Cells were grown on coverslips and treated with RS-1 or
radiation as indicated. They were subsequently ﬁxed with 3%
paraformaldahyde/3.4% sucrose, and permeabilized with a
standard buffer (20 mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5% TritonX100, 50 mmol/L NaCl, 3 mmol/L MgCl2, 300 mmol/L sucrose).
For proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) staining, cells
were treated with ice-cold methanol for 10 minutes at 20 C
following ﬁxation. The slides were immunostained for the
indicated proteins using the following antibodies: a rabbit

Cell-cycle analysis
PC3 cells were treated with 60 mmol/L RS-1 for the indicated
times. Cells were collected and ﬁxed in ice-cold 70% ethanol for
at least 4 hours. Cells were rinsed and stained with 50 mg/mL
propidium iodide, 50 mg/mL RNAse A in PBS for 20 minutes.
Cell-cycle distributions were analyzed by ﬂow cytometry using
a LSR-II (BD Biosciences) cytometer. The percentage of cells in
G1, S, and G2–M phases of the cell cycle was determined using
FlowJo software.
Annexin V staining
PC3 cells treated with 60 mmol/L RS-1 for the indicated times
were harvested and stained with FITC-Annexin V for 10
minutes at room temperature as per manufacturer's instructions (BMS500Fl, eBioscience). Cells were washed and resuspended in PBS containing propidium iodide. Samples were
analyzed by ﬂow cytometry using a LSR-II (BD Biosciences)
cytometer. The percentage of cell positive for both Annexin V
and propidium iodide was determined using FlowJo software.

HEK-293 cells, and tumors were allowed to grow to an average
volume of about 50 mm3. Mice were randomized into treatment groups, each consisting of 7 to 8 mice. Peritoneal
administrations of RS-1 were delivered in 200 mL of vehicle
solutions, which consisted of 30% DMSO, 35% PEG-400, and
35% PBS. Tumor measurements were taken three times per
week with a caliper and expressed as tumor volume, which was
approximated from the product of width  length  height 

volume, and error bars denote SE.
Measurements of RAD51 binding to DNA
Experiments were performed as previously described with
some modiﬁcations (29). Brieﬂy, 75 nmol/L puriﬁed human
RAD51 proteins were incubated with various concentrations of
RS-1 in FP reaction buffer at 37 C for 40 minutes. FP reaction
buffer consisted of 20 mmol/L Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mmol/L MgCl2,
0.25 mmol/L BSA, 2% glycerol, 30 mmol/L NaCl, 4% DMSO, 0.1
mmol/L Tris (2-carboxy-ethyl)-phosphine-HCl (TCEP), and 2
mmol/L ATP. Fluorescently tagged DNA substrate was then
added to a ﬁnal concentration of 100 nmol/L (nucleotide
concentration for ssDNA or base pair concentration for
dsDNA) and incubated at 37 C for another 40 minutes.
DNA substrates consisted of either an Alexa Fluor 488-labeled
oligo-dT 45-mer, a ﬂuorescein-labeled ssDNA oligonucleotide
(DHD162-CD-CF), or a ﬂuorescein-labeled dsDNA double hairpin (DHD162), which were previously described (30). Fluorescence polarization measurements were obtained as previously
described (29). The indicated concentrations of RAD51 and
compounds reﬂect their concentrations in the ﬁnal 50 mL
reaction mixture.

Results
Low levels of RAD54B and RAD54L expression are
associated with sensitivity to RS-1 in immortalized
human cells
High levels of RAD51 overexpression render cells susceptible
to the formation of toxic RAD51 complexes, particularly in
cell types that harbor inadequate translocase activity (18).

RAD51-Stimulatory Compound Kills Malignant Cells

Therefore, we predicted that malignant human cells with low/
limiting levels of RAD54 translocase proteins would be hypersensitive to RS-1, a compound that increases the DNA-binding
activity of RAD51 (28). We examined this hypothesis using a
panel of immortalized human cell lines. Whole-cell levels for
RAD51, RAD54L, and RAD54B proteins were measured by
Western blot analysis, and the quantiﬁcation for each cell line
normalized to levels in PC3 cells (Fig. 1). These relative protein
levels were directly compared against RS-1 sensitivity (LD90
values) by linear regression analysis. The factor most strongly
associated with RS-1 LD90 was RAD54B protein level (R2 ¼
0.33). In contrast, the association RS-1 LD90 was considerably
weaker for RAD51 and RAD54L protein levels (R2 ¼ 0.04 and
0.19, respectively). A combined translocase protein expression
level score was generated, which represents the sum of the
RAD54B and RAD54L levels. Using this score, a signiﬁcant
correlation (R2 ¼ 0.53, P ¼ 0.039) was observed between low
translocase expression level and RS-1 sensitivity.

sensitivity to RS-1. Western blot
analysis is shown in the top of each
panel, and quantiﬁcations thereof
are displayed in Supplementary
Fig. S1. A, forced overexpression
of RAD51 expression levels
sensitizes cells to RS-1. HT1080
cells carrying a doxycyclinerepressible RAD51 transgene were
pretreated with varying levels of
doxycycline for 24 hours. Cells
were subsequently incubated for
24 hours in media containing
varying concentrations of RS-1.
Cells were then allowed to grow in
drug-free media for an additional
6 days, and indicated doxycycline
concentrations were maintained
throughout the entire experiment.
Average survival for each condition
is normalized to the 0 mmol/L RS-1
control of that condition. B,
knockdown of RAD51 in PC3
protects cells from the toxicity of
RS-1. PC3 cells were treated with
various concentrations of RAD51
siRNA or a nonsilencing (NS)
control for 48 hours. Following
RNAi, cells were incubated for
24 hours in media containing
varying concentrations of RS-1.
Cells were then allowed to grow in
drug-free media for an additional 6
days. C, knockdown of RAD54L
and RAD54B sensitizes cancer
cells to the toxicity of RS-1. PC3
cells were treated with siRNA
against RAD54L, RAD54B, both, or
a nonsilencing (NS) control for
48 hours and processed as above.
Statistical signiﬁcance was
determined using ANOVA followed
by Student t tests. The P values are
reported in Supplementary
Table S1.

Sensitivity to RS-1 is dependent on RAD51 and RAD54B/
RAD54L translocases
To conﬁrm that RS-1 toxicity is directly related to RAD51
and translocases protein levels, these proteins were differentially expressed in cells. First, RAD51 was overexpressed in
human ﬁbrosarcoma HT1080 cells carrying a doxycyclinerepressible RAD51 transgene. Consistent with published
data (13), the removal of doxycycline from media generated
high levels of RAD51 expression, reaching a 12.7-fold
increase with 0.1 ng/mL doxycycline relative to 5 ng/mL
doxycycline (Fig. 2A; see quantiﬁcations of Western blot
analyses in Supplementary Fig. S1). Cells with the highest
RAD51 expression levels were signiﬁcantly more sensitive to
RS-1. Next, we asked whether knocking down RAD51 levels
with RNAi would ameliorate RS-1 toxicity. The prostate
cancer cell line PC3 was selected for these experiments,
because the low LD90 to RS-1 suggests a particular susceptibility of PC3 to forming toxic RAD51 complexes. When

RAD51 siRNA was combined with RS-1 treatment, the
RAD51 depletion generated signiﬁcant protection from
RS-1–induced toxicity (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that
the level of RAD51 in PC3 cells limits survival, a likely
consequence of toxic RAD51 complexes. Correspondingly,
stimulation of RAD51 complex formation by RS-1 reduces
survival.
The ability of translocase proteins to ameliorate RS-1–
induced toxicity was tested by knocking down RAD54B and
RAD54L with RNAi (Fig. 2C) in PC3 cells. The knockdown of
either translocase signiﬁcantly sensitized PC3 cells to RS-1
toxicity, though the impact of RAD54B was larger than that of
RAD54L. Combined knockdown of both RAD54 translocases

A

did not generate more RS-1 sensitization than RAD54B siRNA
alone, suggesting that RAD54B has more activity in ameliorating RAD51-dependent toxicity, at least in the context of RS-1
treatment.
To further support our proposed mechanism of action, the
RAD51 knockdown experiment was repeated using ionizing
radiation in the place of RS-1. Unlike the results with RS-1, PC3
cells did not exhibit radiation resistance following RAD51
siRNA (Supplementary Fig. S2). Instead, RAD51 siRNA promoted modest radiation sensitization. This implies that RS-1
kills cells by catalyzing the formation of toxic RAD51 complexes, rather than generating nonspeciﬁc effects on DNA
damage response and repair.

 3 in controls) or MRC5 cells (0.2  0.5 foci/nucleus RS-1
treated vs. 0.1  0.5 foci/nucleus in controls). As a control, both
cell types were also examined after ionizing radiation, and as
expected both PC3 and MRC5 cells exhibited signiﬁcant
induction of both RAD51 (11.6  15.8 and 7.2  14.6 foci/
nucleus, respectively) and RPA staining (12.4  15.8 and 8 
15.4 foci/nucleus, respectively). This indicates that RAD51
levels are not limiting for RAD51 focus formation in MRC5
cells. These results suggest that RS-1 treatment speciﬁcally
leads to the accumulation of RAD51 foci in PC3 and not MRC-5
cells, via a mechanism that is independent of DNA damage.
This interpretation is further supported by a high degree of
RPA/RAD51 focus colocalization after radiation (75%  18% in
PC3 and 78%  19% in MRC5), but not after RS-1 treatment (2%
 3% in PC3 and 0% in MRC5).

Toxic effects of RS-1 occur independently of DSB
formation and cell cycle
To further ensure that RS-1 was generating RAD51 complexes on undamaged chromatin, PC3 cells were continuously
treated with RS-1 and examined microscopically at different
time points out to 48 hours (Fig. 4A and B). Consistent with
earlier experiments, RAD51 foci accumulated 6 hours after
addition of RS-1 (25.2  22 foci/nucleus), and thereafter the
number of foci slowly decreased down to 16.5  12.7 foci/
nucleus at 48 hours. This slow decline over time is likely due to
cell death, which leads to an attrition of adherent measurable
cells. To determine whether RAD51 foci in RS-1–treated cells
were DNA damage independent, cells were counterstained for
phosphorylated histone H2AX, gH2AX, as a surrogate marker
of DSBs. In contrast with the kinetics of RAD51 foci, gH2AX foci

RAD51-Stimulatory Compound Kills Malignant Cells

dose of 110 mg/kg. This was the maximum RS-1 concentration
that could be delivered in 100 mL of our buffer vehicle (30%
DMSO, 35% PEG-400, 35% PBS), due to limited solubility of RS1 in aqueous buffers. With this dose and delivery schedule, mice
experienced a transient weight loss of about 2% to 3% during
the week of treatment; however, they completely regained this
weight in the posttreatment period and demonstrated no other
overt signs of drug toxicity.
Subcutaneous xenografted PC3 tumors were established in
the hind limbs of athymic nude mice, and the mice were
subsequently treated with RS-1 or vehicle control. Treatment
with RS-1 generated signiﬁcant antitumor responses, relative
to the vehicle-alone control mice whose tumors all progressively grew (Fig. 6A). Forty-three percent of tumors (3/7) in the
RS-1 group completely disappeared after treatment and never
regrew during a 2-month observation period. The remaining
tumors in the RS-1–treated group did eventually regrow;
however, treatment generated a >2-week delay in tumor
regrowth relative to the vehicle-alone control. RS-1 treatment
was well tolerated, with no toxic deaths observed. This PC3based tumor experiment was repeated, and the result reproduced. A similar experiment was then performed using tumors
derived from HEK-293 cells, which are faster growing and more
resistant to RS-1 than are PC3 cells. As expected, the degree of
antitumor response was smaller in these tumors (Fig. 6B).
Tumor regrowth was signiﬁcantly delayed by RS-1 treatment;
however, the magnitude of delay was only 2 days.

did not signiﬁcantly increase until 48 hours after addition of
RS-1 (8  7 gH2AX at 0 hours to 22  14 gH2AX at 48 hours).
Furthermore, RAD51 exhibited minimal colocalization with
gH2AX in cells treated with RS-1. For example, only 31%  18%
of RAD51 colocalized with gH2AX at 48 hours. In stark contrast,
93%  15% of irradiation-induced RAD51 foci colocalized with
gH2AX. The timing of gH2AX focus formation also coincided
with a loss of cell viability, as measured in cell survival assays
(Fig. 4C) and the induction of apoptosis, as measured by
Annexin V and propidium iodide staining (Fig. 4D). Taken
together, these results indicate that RS-1 ﬁrst catalyzes the
accumulation of toxic RAD51 complexes on undamaged DNA,
which is subsequently followed by hallmarks of cell death.
Because RAD51 foci associated with DNA damage form
during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, we investigated
whether or not RS-1–mediated RAD51 accumulation is
restricted to these phases of the cell cycle. To test this, RAD51
localization was examined in PC3 cells treated continuously
with RS-1 using PCNA staining as a surrogate for S phase
(Fig. 5A and B). As expected, spontaneous RAD51 foci were
observed in 98% to 100% PCNA-positive cells regardless of
treatment, which is consistent with the normal roles of RAD51
in DNA replication and homologous recombination-mediated
repair. Interestingly, RS-1 treatment signiﬁcantly increased the
number of RAD51 foci in both PCNA-positive and PCNAnegative nuclei. At 12 hours for example, RS-1 generated a
2-fold and 3.2-fold increase in RAD51 foci in PCNA-positive and
PCNA-negative cells, respectively. In addition, cell-cycle proﬁles were examined by ﬂow cytomery. After treatment with RS1 for 6 hours (when RAD51 accumulation was ﬁrst observed),
cell-cycle distribution did not differ between RS-1–treated and
control cells. RS-1 treatment induced only a small enrichment
of cells in S phase, and this effect did not reach statistical
signiﬁcance until 48 hours into RS-1 treatment (Fig. 5C). Taken
together, these data demonstrate that the toxic effects of RS-1
effects are not limited only to cells undergoing replication.

Discussion
We have developed a novel therapeutic approach for oncology using compounds that stimulate the DNA-binding activity
of RAD51. This exploits the propensity of human cancers to
express high levels of RAD51 protein. Because malignant cells
are prone to forming aberrant RAD51 complexes on undamaged chromatin, they are predisposed to killing by RAD51
stimulators, which further enhance this toxic phenotype. Our
results demonstrate that the toxicity of RS-1 depends on both
RAD51 and RAD54 family translocase expression levels. Furthermore, xenograft mouse experiments demonstrate that this
RAD51-stimulatory compound generates antitumor responses

in vivo, thereby providing proof-in-principle for this therapeutic strategy.
Cellular resistance to RAD51 stimulation depends on
RAD54B and RAD54L protein levels, consistent with the ability
of Swi2/Snf 2-related translocases to remove aberrant RAD51
complexes from undamaged chromatin (18, 20). We found,
however, that RAD54B depletion results in greater RS-1 sensitization than RAD54L depletion. Therefore, RAD54B seems to
be the more relevant translocase for this function, at least in
the context of RS-1 treatment. This is consistent with published
results on Rdh54, the yeast homolog of human RAD54B, which
is most important of these Swi2/Snf 2-related translocases for
preventing spontaneous RAD51 focus formation (18). Therefore, human tumors harboring an imbalance of RAD51 and
RAD54B are predicted to be sensitive to treatment with
RAD51-stimulators. Newer diagnostic methods may help to
better quantify the degree of RAD51-to-RAD54B imbalance in
clinical tumor specimens, to better predict RS-1 sensitivity.
Although a wide variety of immortalized human cells (e.g.,
carcinoma, sarcomas, and virally transformed cells) overexpress RAD51 protein (22), we found that the sensitivity of
immortalized cell lines to RS-1 is quite variable. Furthermore,
the degree of RS-1 sensitivities among different cell lines could
not be predicted on the basis of measurements of RAD51
protein levels. Although cellular resistance to RS-1 does depend
on RAD54B and RAD54L protein levels, the vulnerability of
different cancer types to killing by RAD51 stimulators probably
depends on additional factors. We also observed that RAD51stimulatory compounds can generate a reduction in total
cellular RAD51 protein levels in some cell types (data not
shown). Further work is underway to deﬁne the role of
RAD51-stimulatory compounds in these processes because
they may contribute to the differential susceptibility of cancers.

In conclusion, we have developed a novel therapeutic strategy that exploits the propensity of human cancers to form toxic
RAD51 complexes on undamaged chromatin. We are now
developing second-generation chemical analogs with greater
RAD51 stimulatory potency and improved pharmacologic
characteristics (32). Additional work is underway to better
identify tumor characteristics that inﬂuence the susceptibility
of different cancers to this therapeutic approach.
