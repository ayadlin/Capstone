BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to determine whether the addition of low-dose-rate brachytherapy or androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) improves clinical outcome in patients with high-risk prostate cancer (HiRPCa) who received dose-escalated
radiotherapy (RT). METHODS: Between 1995 and 2010, 958 patients with HiRPCa were treated at Schiffler Cancer Center (n ¼ 484) or
at the University of Michigan (n ¼ 474) by receiving either dose-escalated external-beam RT (EBRT) (n ¼ 510; minimum prescription
dose, 75 grays [Gy]; median dose, 78 Gy) or combined-modality RT (CMRT) consisting of 103Pd implants (n ¼ 369) or 125I implants
(n ¼ 79) both with pelvic irradiation (median prescription dose, 45 Gy). The cumulative incidences of biochemical failure (BF) and
prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) were estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method and Fine and Gray regression analysis.
RESULTS: The median follow-up was 63.2 months (interquartile range, 35.4-99.0 months), and 250 patients were followed for >8
years. Compared with CMRT, patients who received EBRT had higher prostate-specific antigen levels, higher tumor classification,
lower Gleason sum, and more frequent receipt of ADT for a longer duration. The 8-year incidence BF and PCSM among patients who
received EBRT was 40% (standard error, 38%-44%) and 13% (standard error, 11%-15%) compared with 14% (standard error, 12%-16%;
P <.0001) and 7% (standard error 6%-9%; P ¼.003) among patients who received CMRT. On multivariate analysis, the hazard ratios
(HRs) for BF and PCSM were 0.35 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.23-0.52; P <.0001) and 0.41 (95% CI, 0.23-0.75; P <.003), favoring
CMRT. Increasing duration of ADT predicted decreased BF (P ¼.04) and PCSM (P ¼.001), which was greatest with long-term ADT (BF:
HR, 0.33; P <.0001; 95% CI, 0.21-0.52; PCSM: HR, 0.30; P ¼.001; 95% CI, 0.15-0.6) even in the subgroup that received CMRT. CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective comparison, both low-dose-rate brachytherapy boost and ADT were associated with decreased risks of

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in the United States and is the second leading cause of death.1
Many patients with PCa have tumors with indolent behavior, but the risk of cancer-specific mortality can be high in those
with high-risk disease,2 and the management of these patients is controversial. Conventional-dose (<72 grays [Gy]) external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT), brachytherapy, and androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) all have produced poor outcomes
when used as monotherapies for high-risk PCa (HiRPCa).4-7 In contrast, the combination of conventional-dose EBRT and
ADT6,7 has demonstrated improved overall survival in randomized clinical trials. However, a subgroup analysis of a
randomized dose-escalation trial suggested that dose-escalated EBRT also reduced PCa-specific mortality (PCSM).8 Nevertheless, the added utility of ADT after dose-escalated radiotherapy (RT) is unknown. Herein we retrospectively reviewed the
results from patients with HiRPCa who were treated at 2 high-volume institutions and assessed the impact of ADT and/or
low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy in addition to dose-escalated EBRT on biochemical relapse and the risk of PCSM.

at the Schiffler Cancer Center (SCC) or the University of
Michigan (UM) with either dose-escalated EBRT or combined-modality RT (EBRT and LDR brachytherapy
boost [CMRT]). Risk was also stratified using a modification of the University of California San Francisco Cancer
of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) tool, which
gives points for PSA, T-classification, Gleason sum, and
age. Unlike the original version,9 the modified CAPRA
score gives 0 points for any Gleason sum of 6, 1 point for
any Gleason sum of 7, and 3 points for any Gleason sum
of 8 to 10, with points from 0 to 9, because it does not
include the ‘‘percentage positive biopsies’’ variable.10
Treatment

The treatment techniques used by both institutions have
been described elsewhere.11,12 Briefly, all EBRT treatments used computed tomography planning with 3dimensional or intensity-modulated RT to a minimum
prescription dose of 75 to 81 Gy in fractions of 1.8 to 2.0
Gy. For EBRT, the clinical target volume typically consisted of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles with prophylactic pelvic radiotherapy. CMRT consisted of pelvic
irradiation delivered either before or after permanent interstitial brachytherapy. The brachytherapy target volume
was the prostate gland with or without the proximal 1.0
cm of seminal vesicles. Patients were implanted either
with 103Pd (prescription dose, 73-100 Gy) or 125I (prescription dose, 108-110 Gy). ADT, consisting of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog alone or combined
with antiandrogen, was used at the discretion of treating
physicians.
Follow-Up and Endpoints

Patients were followed with physical examinations and
PSA measurements at 3-month to 6-months intervals for
the first 5 years and every 6 months to 12 months thereafter. Biochemical failure (BF) was defined by the Phoenix
definition.13 PCSM was defined as death from PCa or
death from any cause after the development of metastatic
or castrate-resistant PCa.
Statistical Analysis

Patients’ clinical and treatment characteristics were compared using analyses of variance and chi-square tests. Univariate survival analysis was performed using with
Kaplan-Meier method, and the cumulative incidence of
failure was evaluated by a Fine and Gray regression analysis. Multivariate survival analysis used Fine and Gray
regression analysis to account for competing causes of
death and/or BF.14 Statistical analysis was performed
using MedCalc (version 11.5; MedCalc Software, Maria682

kerke, Belgium) or STATA (version 12.0; StataCorp;
College Station, Tex).
RESULTS
Patients’ Characteristics and Treatment

Clinical characteristics and treatment details are presented
for 958 patients with HiRPCa who received treatment
between 1995 and 2010 as either dose-escalated EBRT or
CMRT at SCC (n ¼ 484; EBRT, 154; CMRT, 330), or
UM (n ¼ 474; EBRT, 356; CMRT, 118) (Table 1). The
median follow-up was 63.2 months (interquartile range,
35.4-99.0 months), which was not different between the
EBRT and CMRT groups, and 250 patients were followed for >8 years. Patients who underwent EBRT were
older and had higher pretreatment PSA levels and T-classification but lower GS compared with those who were
treated with CMRT. Although the majority of patients in
both groups had only 1 high-risk feature, patients in the
EBRT group were twice as likely to have 2 or 3 high-risk
features (32% vs 16%). Consequently, the CAPRA score
was higher on average in those treated with EBRT as compared with CMRT (5.0 vs 6.0). The median prescription
radiation dose to the prostate in the EBRT group was
78.3 Gy, whereas, among the patients who received
CMRT, 369 received 103Pd implants, and 79 received
125
I implants. There was more frequent use of ADT and
for a longer duration in the EBRT group (85%; median
duration, 22 months) versus those who received CMRT
(76%; median duration, 12 months).
Clinical Outcomes

BF was observed in 171 patients (18%), including 129
patients (25%) who received EBRT and 42 patients (9%)
who received CMRT (chi-square statistic, 0.36;
P < .0001). There were 261 deaths (27%), including 176
(35%) in the EBRT group and 85 (19%) in the CMRT
group (chi-square statistic, 0.54; P < .0001); and 70 deaths
(7%) were from PCa, with including 51 deaths (10%) in
the EBRT group and 19 deaths (4%) in the CMRT group
(chi-square statistic, 0.25; P ¼ .001). The Cox proportional
hazards model indicated that each point in the modified
CAPRA score was related directly to an increasing risk of
BF (P < .0001; HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.37-1.68) and PCSM
(P < .0001; HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.33-1.82) without differences in the prognostic significance of the CAPRA score
between the EBRT and CMRT groups.
Association Between Outcomes and the Receipt
of Brachytherapy

adjusting for other variables, there were significantly

Association Between Outcomes and the Receipt
of Androgen-Deprivation Therapy

Unlike patients in the CMRT group, who generally had
lower risk disease compared with patients in the EBRT
group, those who received ADT, on average, had higher
risk disease than those who did not receive ADT (CAPRA
score, 5.0 vs 5.6; P < .001, chi-square test). Moreover, the
Cancer

February 1, 2013

Radiation for High-Risk Prostate Cancer/Shilkrut et al

patients who received ADT for a longer duration had
higher CAPRA scores than those who received ADT for
shorter durations (P < .0001; data not shown). Despite
this difference, the receipt of ADT was associated with a
lower BF rate in Kaplan-Meier analysis: The 5-year and 8year BF rates were in 23% (standard error, 20%-26%)
and 31% (standard error, 27%-35%), respectively, without ADT compared with 18% (standard error, 16%20%) and 26% (standard error, 24%-28%), respectively,
with ADT (P ¼ .0027; HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.47-0.99)
(Fig. 1C). However, a trend (but no statistical difference)
was observed in the PCSM rate with the receipt ADT,
which was 5% (standard error, 3%-7%) at 5 years and
15% (standard error, 10%-20%) at 8 years without ADT
compared with 4% (standard error, 3%-5%) at 5 years
and 9% (standard error, 7%-11%) at 8 years with ADT
(P ¼ .68; HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.52-1.60) (Fig. 1D). The
HRs derived from the Fine and Gray cumulative regression analysis adjusted for the competing risk of death were
similar at 0.63 (P ¼ .008; 95% CI, 0.44-0.89) for BF and
0.75 (P ¼ .30; 95% CI, 0.44-1.29) for PCSM.
The Influence of Treatment on Outcomes
Adjusted for the Number of High-Risk Features

The EBRT group had twice as many patients who had >1
high-risk feature compared with the CMRT group,
whereas the number of these features was prognostic for
both BF and PCSM (Fig. 2A,B). In an exploratory subgroup analysis, after adjusting for the number of high-risk
features by clustering into a ‘‘low’’ high-risk group (a single high-risk feature) and a ‘‘high’’ high-risk group (>1
high-risk feature), we observed that CMRT had a lower
BF rate in both groups (‘‘low’’ high-risk group: HR, 0.44;
P < .0001; 95% CI, 0.28-0.69; ‘‘high’’ high-risk group:
HR, 0.41; P ¼ .004; 95% CI, 0.22-0.75) (Fig. 2C,E).
CMRT, however, was not associated with significantly
lower PCSM in either the ‘‘low’’ high-risk group (P ¼ .17;
HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.30-1.23; crude PCSM, 5%; 33 of
722 patients) nor the ‘‘high’’ high-risk group (P ¼ .21;
HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.24-1.38; crude PCSM, 16%; 37 of
237 patients) (Fig. 2D,F).
Multivariate Analysis for Biochemical Failure
and Prostate Cancer-Specific Mortality:
Demonstrated Improvements With
Combined-Modality Radiotherapy and
Androgen-Deprivation Therapy

Given the imbalance of clinical risk features as well as
competing causes of death (because more men died of
causes other than PCa), multivariate Fine and Gray cumulative regression analysis was performed controlling for
age, PSA, T-classification, Gleason sum, RT regimen, and
Cancer

both the receipt and duration of ADT (Table 3). Models
initially were carried out for all patients and then were run
separately in those who received EBRT and those who
received CMRT. Older age led to decreased risks of both
BF and PCSM; whereas increasing PSA, T-classification,
and Gleason sum all were associated with worse BF and
PCSM, with the greatest risk associated with a Gleason
sum of 9 or 10 (Table 3). The receipt of brachytherapy
was correlated with a 65% relative reduction in BF
(P < .0001; HR, 65; 95% CI, 0.23-0.52) and a 59% relative reduction in PCSM (P ¼ .004; HR, 0.41; 95% CI,
0.23-0.75). Similarly, the receipt of ADT was correlated
with lower BF, and a more favorable HR was observed
with each incremental increase in ADT duration (<12
months, 12-<24 months, and 24 months) that was statistically significant for each group but greatest for those
who received 24 months of ADT (P < .0001; HR, 0.33;
95% CI, 0.21-0.52). Increasing duration of ADT also was
associated with lower PCSM; however, only those who
received ADT for 24 months demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in PCSM (P ¼ .001; HR, 0.30;
95% CI, 0.15-0.60). Graphic representations are presented for the adjusted impact of CMRT on BF (Fig. 3A)
and PCSM (Fig. 3B), and the impact of ADT duration is
illustrated for BF (Fig. 3C) and PCSM (Fig. 3D). Repeating these analyses with ADT as a continuous variable
revealed that each 1-month increase in the duration of
ADT was associated with lower BF (HR, 0.98; P ¼ .04;
95% CI, 0.97-1.0) and PCSM (HR, 0.97; P ¼ .001; 95%
CI, 0.95-0.99). In further subgroup analyses, long-term
ADT (24 months) was associated with both reduced BF
(HR, 0.37; P < .0001; 95% CI, 0.21-0.64) and reduced
PCSM (HR, 0.25; P ¼ .001; 95% CI, 0.11-0.56) for
those who received EBRT, and it was associated with
reduced BF (HR, 0.21; P ¼ .003; 95% CI, 0.08-0.58) in
those who received CMRT. However, there was not a
statistically significant reduction in PCSM in the subgroup of patients who received CMRT with the addition
of ADT assessed either as a categoric variable (HR, 0.54;
P ¼ .42; 95% CI, 0.12-2.2) or as a continuous variable
(HR, 0.97; P ¼ .20; 95% CI, 0.92-1.02), although the
HRs were very similar to those observed for EBRT.
Finally, to control for potential institutional differences, treating institution was included as a variable. Differences between institutions were not statistically
significant (P  .1 for BF and PCSM; data not shown);
and, when treating institution was included in the multivariate analyses, the HRs favoring CMRT for BF
(P ¼ .0008; HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.26-0.70) and PCSM
(P ¼ .038; HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.23-0.95) were similar to

DISCUSSION
In patients with HiRPCa, randomized trials have
demonstrated that long-term ADT added to conventional-dose EBRT improves relapse-free survival,

PCSM, and overall survival.6,7 In separate trials, doseescalated RT demonstrated better biochemical recurrence-free survival8,15 and, recently, in an unplanned
subgroup analysis, better disease-specific survival in
patients with HiRPCa.8 However, it remains unclear
whether ADT still improves outcomes after dose-escalated EBRT or whether further escalation of the RT

The interaction terms between receipt of ADT (yes vs. no) and treatment regimen (EBRT vs CMRT) as well as ADT duration and treatment regimen also were
evaluated in biochemical failure and prostate cancer-specific mortality models. In all analyses, the interaction terms were not statistically significant (data not
shown) and were not included in the final models.

Figure 3. These plots illustrate cumulative incidence according to the multivariate model for (A) biochemical failure (BF) and (B)
prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) for all patients and all durations of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) and controlling for ADT duration for (C) BF and (D) PCSM for all patients. EBRT indicates external-beam radiotherapy; CMRT, combined-modality radiotherapy; HR, hazard radio; CI, confidence interval.

dose through the addition of brachytherapy to doseescalated EBRT provides any benefit.
The current retrospective analysis is one of the largest to date investigating patients with HiRPCa who
received dose-escalated RT or CMRT. The treatments
were not allocated randomly, which is a significant limitation. Consequently, the patients who received EBRT were
older, had more advanced disease, and received ADT
more frequently and for a longer duration than the
patients who received CMRT. The CAPRA score for the
EBRT group was 1 point higher than for the CMRT
group, which would translate into approximately 1.5-fold
higher rates of both BF and PCSM.10 In reality, the BF
and PCSM rates were 2.9-fold and 2.2-fold higher in the
EBRT group, suggesting that, after adjusting for risk factors, the type of RT received may explain the difference.
One possible explanation for better efficacy of
CMRT is the higher biologically effective dose of RT that
can be achieved with a brachytherapy boost. For example,
the 2-Gy per fraction equivalent dose of combining 45 Gy
EBRT and 112 Gy of 125I is 106 Gy,16 and meta-analysis
of EBRT dose-escalation trials revealed that every added 1
Gy yielded a 2.2% gain in the 8-year rate of freedom from
BF.17 Assuming a linear dose-response relation for doses
>80 Gy, an additional 12 to 13 Gy on top of the median
78 Gy would be required to account for the 27% difference
in the 8-year freedom from BF rate observed between the 2
subsets of patients in our study, which fits within the presumed additional dose delivered by LDR brachytherapy.
Is it reasonable to assume that LDR brachytherapy
also would improve PCSM? Two recent phase 3 studies
demonstrated that improved local control by adding
EBRT to life-long ADT improved freedom from BF,
PCSM, and OS in patients with locally advanced PCa.5,18
In addition, 3 randomized trials of adjuvant EBRT after
radical prostatectomy for PCa with high-risk features also
demonstrated a 50% relative reduction in BF19-21 and a
9% improvement in 10-year OS in the study with the longest follow-up.19 Thus, even for HiRPCa in 5 randomized
trials, improvements in local control with the addition of
RT demonstrated improved BF, and 3 of these trials demonstrated improvements in PCSM and OS. Consequently, is it possible that the local failure rate after doseescalated RT is decreased with a brachytherapy boost?
Two additional randomized studies did demonstrate significant improvements in BF with prostate brachytherapy
added to EBRT (although the control arm was not doseescalated RT).22,23 In addition, the positive biopsies percentages after conventional-dose EBRT have been as high
as 50%, which are reduced with either dose-escalated
688

EBRT or with ADT added to EBRT, but still are in excess
of 20%.24 In contrast, biopsy-proven local failure rates after combined ADT, EBRT, and LDR brachytherapy have
been <10%, even in patients with HiRPCa.25 Thus, the
improvement in PCSM observed with CMRT in the current study is plausible within the context of previous
improvements observed with RT in localized or locally
advanced PCa.
In addition, in the current analysis, the receipt of
ADT also was associated with lower BF, which became
greater with increasing duration of ADT and was consistent across both RT modalities. Longer duration ADT
(24 months) also improved PCSM in all patients and in
those who received EBRT alone, but not when ADT was
analyzed separately in the CMRT group. However, the
low absolute PCSM in this group (19 deaths; 4%) makes
it difficult to demonstrate an improvement, especially
because 76% of patients in the CMRT group had already
received ADT for a median of 12 months. In any case, in
this series, we observed no evidence of the worse outcomes
from ADT combined with brachytherapy that have been
reported by others.26 The reduction in PCSM with ADT
observed in the current study translates into a 40% relative
improvement in PCSM (95% CI, 0.3%-1.1%) for shortduration ADT (<12 months) and 70% improvement
(95% CI, 0.15%-0.60%) for long-duration ADT (24
months), both of which are similar in magnitude to what
was observed with ADT duration in a meta-analysis of
4128 patients who received treatment in the 1980s and
1990s on 4 Radiation Therapy Oncology Group trials
with conventional-dose RT.27 However, the overall rates
of PCSM were lower in the current study, which may
reflect an improved outcome with dose-escalated EBRT
and a lower overall risk of PCa in this contemporary
cohort.
Although it is retrospective and nonrandomized in
nature, this study comprises 1 of the largest series to date
of patients with HiRPCa who received treatment using
modern RT techniques and doses. Comorbid illnesses
were not routinely or uniformly collected across all treatment sites and, as such, could not be evaluated. Given the
younger age and likely lower comorbid illnesses in the
brachytherapy group, we chose not to evaluate all-cause
mortality, because we were not able to appropriately control for comorbid illness. Although we tried to take into
account all measured confounders, including the treating
institution, in the multivariate analysis, it is likely that
other factors, such as prostate size, urinary function, and
medical comorbidities, contributed to differences between
groups that would temper our conclusions; nevertheless,

the outcomes in this study were similar to previous reports
for either RT modality.15,25,28 Moreover, a recent analysis
of brachytherapy-based outcomes also demonstrated an
association with decreased PCSM when both EBRT and
ADT were added to LDR brachytherapy.28 In addition,
an analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results (SEER) database revealed that the rates of CMRT
use for the treatment of HiRPCa have increased 6-fold
since 1988; however, only 19.4% of patients with
HiRPCa received this treatment between 1988 and 2000;
although in that SEER analysis, the PCSM rate was lower
for those who received brachytherapy-based treatment.29
In contrast, an analysis of treatment trends in >10,000
men with HiRPCa who were treated in academic and
community urology-based practices revealed that the majority of patients received possibly less effective monotherapy approaches, including a high proportion that received
primary ADT, with an increasing trend in the receipt of
primary ADT (from 18% to 29%) over the 10-year study
period, and brachytherapy rarely was used.3 The current
study also did not address the toxicity of these treatment;
however results from the Radiation Therapy Oncology
Group RTOG 00-19 study suggest a higher rate of genitourinary toxicity with the addition of brachytherapy to
EBRT in a multi-institutional phase 2 study.30
In conclusion, the results from this multi-institutional, retrospective study suggest that, for patients with
HiRPCa, the receipt of an LDR brachytherapy boost
decreased the risk of BF and PCSM compared with doseescalated EBRT. Furthermore, even with dose-escalated
EBRT or combination therapy, ADT decreased BF and
PCSM in a duration-dependent fashion, and the greatest
benefit was observed for long-term ADT. Validation of
these findings in the University of British Columbia
Androgen Suppression Combined with Elective Nodal and
Dose-Escalated RT trial, which is comparing dose-escalated EBRT (78 Gy) versus CMRT plus 125I LDR boost
(both with 12 months of ADT), may significantly change
the treatment standard for patients with HiRPCa.31
