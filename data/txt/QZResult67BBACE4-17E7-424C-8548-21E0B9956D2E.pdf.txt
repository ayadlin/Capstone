Abstract
Adenosine targeting is an attractive new approach to cancer treatment, but no clinical study has yet examined
adenosine inhibition in oncology despite the safe clinical proﬁle of adenosine A2A receptor inhibitors (A2ARi) in
Parkinson disease. Metastasis is the main cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and therefore we have
studied experimental and spontaneous mouse models of melanoma and breast cancer metastasis to demonstrate the efﬁcacy and mechanism of a combination of A2ARi in combination with anti-PD-1 monoclonal
antibody (mAb). This combination signiﬁcantly reduces metastatic burden and prolongs the life of mice
compared with either monotherapy alone. Importantly, the combination was only effective when the tumor
expressed high levels of CD73, suggesting a tumor biomarker that at a minimum could be used to stratify
patients that might receive this combination. The mechanism of the combination therapy was critically
dependent on NK cells and IFNg, and to a lesser extent, CD8þ T cells and the effector molecule, perforin. Overall,
these results provide a strong rationale to use A2ARi with anti-PD-1 mAb for the treatment of minimal residual
and metastatic disease. Cancer Res; 74(14); 3652–8. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Tumor-induced immunosuppression is a major hurdle to
the efﬁcacy of current cancer therapies. Perhaps because of
their remarkable clinical efﬁcacy against a broader range of
cancers, recent successes with immune checkpoint blockade
inhibitors such as anti-CTLA-4 (ipilumumab; refs. 1 and 2) and
anti-PD-1/PDL1 (nivolumab, MK-3475/MPDL3280A, MDX1105; refs. 3–5) are revolutionizing cancer treatment. Immune
checkpoints refer to a plethora of inhibitory pathways hardwired into the immune system that are crucial for maintaining
self-tolerance and modulating the duration and amplitude of
physiologic immune responses in peripheral tissues to minimize collateral damage. Ipilumumab and nivolumab generated
very effective responses in advanced melanoma when used in
combination (6), but the former triggered a signiﬁcant number
of immune-related adverse events, even when used as single
therapy (7), which may limit its potentially broader use in
combinations. Because of the number of immunosuppressive

mechanisms utilized by tumors, it is becoming increasingly
apparent that targeting multiple immunosuppressive pathways has the potential to enhance therapeutic efﬁcacy without
an increase in adverse events associated with excessive inﬂammation/autoimmunity (8).
One promising molecule that is a new target in preclinical
studies is immunosuppressive adenosine. This metabolite is
produced by the CD73 ectoenzyme expressed on host suppressor cells and tumor cells (9). Inhibition of CD73 using a
monoclonal antibody (mAb) has been shown to reduce tumor
growth and metastasis by enhancing antitumor immunity (10).
Both host and tumor-expressed CD73 are important suppressive mechanisms, because knockdown or overexpression of
CD73 on tumor cells can modulate tumor growth and metastasis (9–11). In addition, CD73/ mice are protected from
transplanted and spontaneous tumors (10, 12, 13). In humans,
high CD73 expression in triple negative breast cancer has been
shown to be a negative prognostic marker and correlates with a
high risk of metastasis (14, 15). The protumor effects of CD73
are believed to be largely because of adenosine-mediated
immunosuppression. Adenosine binds to four known receptors A1, A2A, A2B, and A3, with the activation of A2A and A2B
receptors known to suppress the effector functions of many
immune cells (10). In the microenvironment of the tumor, both
A2A and A2B receptor activation has been demonstrated to
suppress antitumor immunity (11, 16, 17) and increase the
spread of CD73þ tumors (9). In addition, either A2A or A2B
blockade with small molecule antagonists can reduce tumor
metastasis. Because A2A receptor expression is increased in
lymphocytes following activation (18), we hypothesized therapies that liberate lymphocyte effector responses, such as antiCTLA-4, anti-PD-1, and anti-Tim3 (19–21), may also increase

responses to metastasis.

Materials and Methods
Mice
C57BL/6 and BALB/c wild-type (WT) mice were purchased
from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute for Medical Research
or ARC Animal Resource Centre. C57BL/6 perforin-deﬁcient
(pfp/) and C57BL/6 DEREG (FoxP3-DTR-GFP) mice were
bred in-house at the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute. All mice were maintained at the QIMR Berghofer Medical
Research Institute and used between the ages of 6 to 14 weeks.
Groups of 5 to 10 mice per experiment were used for experimental and spontaneous tumor metastasis assays. These
group sizes were used to ensure adequate power to detect
biologic differences. All experiments were approved by the

In vivo treatments
For spontaneous metastasis and postsurgery survival
experiments, 5  104 4T1.2 tumor cells were inoculated into
the fourth mammary fat-pad of BALB/c mice. On day 20 to 22,
mice were anesthetized, the primary tumor was surgically
removed, the wound was closed with surgical clips, and treatments commenced immediately as indicated. For experimental metastasis, 1 or 2  105 B16F10 or B16F10-CD73hi cells were
injected intravenously in 200 mL PBS and the treatment
commenced immediately after (day 0) and day 3. B16F10 and
B16F10-CD73hi macrometastases on the surface of the lungs
were counted using a dissecting microscope (Nikon SMZ
745T).
Flow cytometry
Eight- to 12-week-old C57BL/6 mice were injected with
2.5  105 B16F10-CD73hi cells intravenously into the tail
vein (10 mice per group). Mice were treated with SCH58261
(1 mg/kg) or anti-PD-1 (250 mg/mouse) or the combination of
both or with isotype control mAb (clone 2A3, 250 mg/mouse) on
day 0 and day 3. Mice were sacriﬁced on day 5 and lungs were
collected after perfusion with PBS and mechanically dissociated using the Medimachine (Dako) to obtain cell suspensions.
Hematopoietic cells were then puriﬁed using a discontinuous
Percoll gradient and stained for ﬂow cytometry.
The following antibodies were used: CD3 PerCPeﬂuor710
(500A2), CD8 APCeﬂuor780 (53-6.7), Foxp3 eﬂuor605NC (FJK16s), NK1.1 CD106a PE (1D4B), CD45.2 PECy7 (104), CD4 Alexa
Fluor 700 (RM4-5) from BD Biosciences and NK1.1 Alexa Fluor
488 (PK13) from Biolegend. Stained cells were acquired and
analyzed by multicolor ﬂow cytometry using an LSR Fortessa
(BD Biosciences).
Analysis of adenosine receptor expression by RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from cancer cell lines and ﬂow
cytometry-sorted splenic lymphocytes by using RNAzol (Sigma-Aldrich) as per the manufacturer's instructions. For cDNA
synthesis, 500 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed in 20 mL
reaction containing 500 mmol/L dNTP mix, 500 nmol/L OligodT, 200U of Tetro Reverse Transcriptase and 20 U of Ribosafe
RNase Inhibitor (Bioline) at 42 C for 50 min. The reactions
were heated at 85 C for 5 minutes, cDNA product was diluted
to 10 ng/mL and 2 mL of cDNA was subjected to 10 mL real-time
PCR reaction using SensiFAST SYBR Lo-ROX Kit (Bioline)
and primers (Sigma-Aldrich) on Applied Biosystems ViiA 7
Real-Time PCR system. Ct values for A2A receptor were compared with the housekeeping gene RPL32 using the following
mouse primers: L32 forward-TTCCTGGTCCACAATGTCAAG,
L32 Reverse- TGTGAGCGATCTCAGCAC, A2A receptor Forward- CAGAGTTCCATCTTCAGCCTC. A2A receptor ReverseCACCCAGCAAATCGCAATG.

experimental lung metastasis (9). Here we have conﬁrmed that
activity and examined A2ARi in the context of checkpoint
blockade by additionally treating mice with anti-CTLA-4,
anti-PD-1, or anti-Tim3 (Fig. 1A). Early treatment of B16F10CD73hi lung metastases by anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, or antiTim3 mAb alone was relatively ineffective, compared with A2A
Ri treatment alone over the same period. However, each of 3
checkpoint blockade mAbs, further enhanced the activity of
A2ARi when given coincidently in combination (Fig. 1A). This
combination and effect of A2ARi alone was speciﬁc for CD73hi
expressing B16F10, because neither A2ARi alone, nor in combination, was effective in suppressing lung metastases of the
parental B16F10 cells (Fig. 1B). This suggests that combination
therapy involving A2ARi may be successfully used for patients
with high tumor cell expression of CD73, such as those with
poor prognosis triple negative breast cancer (15). Given the
promise of anti-PD-1 mAbs in the clinic, we decided to pursue
further general utility and mechanism of this combination.
Initially, we conﬁrmed the effect of the combination against
B16F10-CD73hi melanoma metastases by varying the schedule
of A2ARi and checkpoint blockade (Fig. 1C). Coincident treat-

ment of A2ARi and anti-PD-1 mAb on days 0 and 3 after tumor
inoculation was superior to other schedules, although A2ARi
given twice on day 0 and anti-PD-1 mAb twice on day 3; or
A2ARi given on day 0 and 1 and anti-PD-1 given on days 2 and 3
were also effective. Late treatment with A2ARi seemed to be less
effective (Fig. 1C) and delayed combination therapy was not
signiﬁcant when treatment commenced at day 2 onwards post
tumor inoculation (Fig. 1D). These data indicated the combinatorial promise of checkpoint blockade and A2ARi and the
potential use of tumor CD73 expression as a predictive marker
of response to A2ARi or A2ARi and checkpoint blockade.
A2AR and PD-1 blockade combine to suppress
spontaneous lung metastases
The 4T1.2 mammary carcinoma expresses high levels of
CD73 constitutively (10) and may be used as a model of primary
tumor resection and metastasis to test therapies in a clinically
relevant setting. We have previously shown that the A2ARi,
SCH58261, can inhibit spontaneous lung metastases when
given early to mice (from day 3) with primary mammary tumor
intact (9). When mice were administered A2ARi four times

prolongation in lifespan was achieved (Fig. 2A, P <0.01). By
contrast, mice that were additionally depleted of NK cells or

that survival beneﬁt, indicating the nonredundant function of
these lymphocyte subsets in the mechanism of antimetastatic
activity of A2ARi (Fig. 2A). We next assessed the combinatorial
effect of A2ARi and anti-PD-1 mAb in the same experimental
model and found that anti-PD-1 and A2ARi were superior to
either monotherapy alone (Fig. 2B). Thus, in both experimental

CD4þ T cells did not seem to have a critical additional role
(Fig. 3A). In the surgical resection and spontaneous metastasis
of 4T1.2 tumor model, both CD8þ T cells and NK cells were key
in the optimal antitumor activity generated by the combination
anti-PD-1 mAb and A2ARi (Fig. 3B). Thus, in both experimental
and spontaneous tumor metastasis models, the combination
of A2AR and PD-1 blockade was able to engage CD8þ T and
NK-cell effector function. This effector function was displayed
by the critical need for host perforin and IFNg pathways in the
optimal antimetastatic activity of the anti-PD-1 mAb and A2ARi
combination (Fig. 4A).
To our knowledge, there is no functional antibody available
to detect mouse adenosine receptors. To assess the target of
A2ARi, SCH58261, we analyzed the mRNA expression of A2AR on
B16F10-GFP and B16F10-CD73hi mouse melanoma and 4T1.2
mammary carcinoma cell lines. The A2AR expression on tumor
cells was at minimum 1,000-fold lower than in lymphocytes
and it was independent of the tumor cell expression of CD73
(Fig. 4B). Interestingly, the expression of A2AR on splenic NK
cells was 5-fold higher than other lymphocytes (Fig. 4B),
suggesting that lymphocytes (CD4þ T cells, CD8þ T cells, and
regulatory T cells) and in particular NK cells are the possible
target of A2ARi in the tumor microenvironment. Our data are
consistent with a previous ﬁnding where SCH58261 and NECA
antagonized one another when added to NK cell:B16F10
cocultures, NECA signiﬁcantly suppressing NK-cell–mediated
killing activity in vitro (9). In addition, we also found signiﬁcantly increased NK-cell proportions in the lungs of mice with
5-day B16F10-CD73hi metastases and treated with monotherapy or combination therapy compared with control treated
mice (Fig. 4C). NK-cell numbers were enhanced in the combination group (Fig. 4D), whereas the numbers of other
immune cell populations were not signiﬁcantly different
between the treatment groups (data not shown).

Conclusions
We conclude that treatment of mice with a combination of
A2ARi and anti-PD-1 mAb substantially reduces experimental
and spontaneous metastases and increases the survival of
mice, compared with either monotherapy. The antimetastatic
activity of the A2ARi and combination immunotherapy is
dependent upon CD73 expression on tumor cells whereas the
mechanism of the combination is largely dependent on NK
cells and IFNg, and to a lesser extent on CD8þ T cells and
perforin-dependent effector functions. This effector mecha-

nism is possibly also a combination of the reported perforindependent activity of A2ARi (9) and IFNg activity of anti-PD-1
(22). Notably, adenosine or CD73 blockade has not yet been
attempted in patients with cancer, despite the safety proﬁle of
A2ARi in human neurologic disease. The great promise of antiPD-1 in the treatment of several human malignancies, including melanoma, non–small cell lung cancer and renal cancer, is
being realized, and new combinations with anti-PD-1 are being
explored and having further impact (6). Treatment of metastatic disease should be a priority and these results strongly
advocate a combination of A2ARi with anti-PD-1 in the treatment of metastatic disease.
