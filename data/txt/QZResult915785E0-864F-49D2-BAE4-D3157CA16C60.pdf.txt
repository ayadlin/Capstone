Abstract
High levels of circulating heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) are detected in many
cancers. In order to explore the effects of extracellular HSP70 on human microvascular
endothelial cells (HMEC), we initially used gap-FRAP technique. Extracellular
human HSP70 (rhHSP70), but not rhHSP27, blocks the gap-junction intercellular
communication (GJIC) between HMEC, disrupts the structural integrity of HMEC
junction plaques, and decreases connexin43 (Cx43) expression, which correlates
with the phosphorylation of Cx43 serine residues. Further exploration of these effects
identified a rapid transactivation of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor in a Toll-Like
Receptor 4-dependent manner, preceding its internalization. In turn, cytosolic Ca2+
oscillations are generated. Both GJIC blockade and Ca2+ mobilization partially depend
on ATP release through Cx43 and pannexin (Panx-1) channels, as demonstrated by
blocking activity or expression of channels, and inactivating extracellular ATP. By
monitoring dye-spreading into adjacent cells, we show that HSP70 released from
human monocytes in response to macrophage colony-stimulating factor, prevents the
formation of GJIC between monocytes and HMEC. Therapeutic manipulation of this
pathway could be of interest in inflammatory and tumor growth.

INTRODUCTION

and differentiation of cells. Gap junctions are plasma
membrane domains containing intercellular channels
that allow a direct exchange of ions and small molecules
between adjacent cells. The channels are composed of two
hemichannels and are formed when a hemichannel from
one cell docks with a symmetrically opposed hemichannel
from a neighboring cell [14]. Each hemichannel is an
oligomer of six proteins named connexins (Cx), which
form the central pore of the channel. Connexins expressed
within the vasculature include Cx37, 40, 43 and 45 [15,
16]. Although they are differentially expressed along
the vascular tree, Cx43 is the most widely and highly
expressed protein in all cell models and human tissues.
The permeability of gap junctions can be affected by a
number of mechanisms, including changes in cytosolic

Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) which was initially
described as an intracellular protein [1-3] is also released
into the circulation under various stress conditions [4-9].
Circulating HSP70 is increased in pathological conditions
including cancer cell invasiveness and metastasis [10-12].
Irrespective of whether HSP70 enters the circulation via
an active or passive release mechanism, the role of this
extracellular HSP70 remains poorly understood.
High levels of circulating HSP70 are reported to
correlate with monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells [13].

ion concentrations and Cx43 phosphorylation [17].
Their aberrant function has been associated with a
number of pathological conditions, including cancer and
inflammation [18-21].
Whereas the role of Cx hemichannels formed by
Cx43 in modulation of monocytes-endothelial adhesion
is well identified [22, 23], the role of the paracrine
intercellular communication is less clear. This paracrine
communication does not require cell-cell apposition, as
it involves release of one or more signalling molecules
into the extracellular medium, and their subsequent
interaction with receptors, such as G protein-coupled
receptors (GPCRs), on neighboring cells [24]. One of
these paracrine factors is adenosine triphosphate (ATP),
which is released through unpaired Cx hemichannels (not
connecting cells) and propagates intercellular Ca2+ waves.
Extracellular HSP70 induces signal transduction
through the LPS receptor CD14 in monocytes and
macrophages [25, 26]. In malignant cells, HSP70 also
induces a TLR4-dependent EGFR phosphorylation,
which triggers MAPK signaling [6, 25, 27]. Because LPS
or EGF induce Cx43 phosphorylation leading to GJIC
abrogation [28, 29], we examined whether extracellular
HSP70, exogenously added or released from circulating
monocytes, modulates GJIC and Cx43-hemichannel
functions in human microvascular endothelial cells
(HMEC) via the engagement of specific membrane
receptor-associated signaling pathways in HMEC.

HMEC (Fig. 1B). A time-dependent decrease in k was
observed within 1 h (from 0.417 ± 0.100 min-1 in untreated
to 0.032 ± 0.014 min-1 in rhHSP70-treated cells; mean ±
SD, n=8; Fig. 1C). In comparison, HMEC exposure to
rhHSP27 rather increased k (from 0.488 ± 0.207 min-1 in
untreated cells to 0.643 ± 0.277 min-1; n=8). Addition of
polymyxin B (PMB100 ng/ml) did not prevent the timedependent decrease in k value observed with rhHSP70
(from 0.445 ± 0.111 min-1 in control to 0.097 ± 0.100 min-1;
n=3). Thus, the rhHSP70-induced GJIC inhibition is
mainly caused by the rhHSP70 protein itself, rather than
by any contaminating endotoxin.

Extracellular rhHSP70 modulates Cx43 protein
expression and phosphorylation
Connexin 43 (Cx43) which is the most widely and
highly expressed gap junction protein [36], is detected
at the level of gap junction plaques and within the
intracellular space of HMEC cultures (Fig. 2A). Consistent
with GJIC abrogation, rhHSP70 decreased Cx43 at the
plasma membrane within 30 min and disrupted the Cx43
gap junction plaques within 1h. As Cx43 incorporated into
gap junction plaques is insoluble in Triton X-100 [32], we
subjected HMEC to a Triton X-100 fractionation assay and
determined the relative amount of Cx43 in the junctional
plaques. Figure 2B shows that rhHSP70 provoked a drastic
reduction in Cx43 expression at the plasma membrane
(46 ± 6% of control after 1 h; **P<0.001, n=5). We did
not detect significant changes in expression of the other
endothelial-specific Cx37 and Cx40 (Suppl. Fig. S3).
Specific serine phosphorylations in the C-terminal
tail of Cx43 [37] were increased by rhHSP70 within
1 h (Fig. 2C), as expected for a blockage of GJIC [38,
39]. All these phosphorylating effects of rhHSP70 were
antagonized by cell pretreatment with a neutralizing
antibody against toll-like receptors (TLR) 4 (AbTLR4)
(Fig. 2D).
Zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) is the major protein
that interacts with Cx43, precisely through its C-terminal
region, to form functional gap junction plaques [40,
41]. Interestingly, inhibition of ZO-1/Cx43 interaction
has been shown to promote Cx43 phosphorylation on
Ser368. As shown in Figure 2E, HMEC displayed large
cell border-localized ZO-1 which was not delocalized
upon 1 h of rhHSP70 application. Furthermore ZO-1
coimmunoprecipitated with Cx43 in control as well
after 30 min of cell exposure to rhHSP70 but not in the
following time periods (Fig. 2F). Disruption of the Cx43/
ZO-1 interaction coincides not only with the reduction
of Cx43 present at the plasma membrane, but also its
phosphorylation at Ser368, as previously reported [42]
(but not of Tyr265, Suppl. Fig. S3).

Results
Extracellular recombinant human HSP70
(rhHSP70) blocks the gap junction intercellular
communication (GJIC) between human
microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC)
The effects of rhHSP70 were analyzed on the
functionality of gap junctions established between
HMEC in confluent monolayer by using the gap-FRAP
technique [30, 35]. Briefly, HMEC were loaded with a
diffusible tracer (calcein/AM), and the fluorescence of
investigated cells was suppressed by a laser beam. The
recovery of fluorescence in these cells, which results from
the intercellular diffusion of calcein from neighboring
cells, was recorded to measure the diffusion rate constant
k (min-1), an index of gap junction permeability. Figure 1A
shows typical changes in the fluorescence of cells, before
and after photobleaching. rhHSP70 was used at 5 µg/ml
(Fig. 1B, open circles), a concentration that evoked both
maximal spreading of HMEC spheroids (Suppl. Fig. S1)
and increase in cell motility (Suppl. Fig. S2). rhHSP70
prevented the fluorescence recovery normally observed
in cells exposed to control solution (black circles),
demonstrating that rhHSP70 blocked the GJIC between

Extracellular rhHSP70 mediates EGFR
transactivation contributing to GJIC abrogation

After boiling rhHSP70 solution for 30 min,
which denaturizes the protein but not LPS, EGFR
phosphorylation was no longer observed, indicating that
the effect of intact rhHSP70 was due to HSP70 itself
(Fig. 3B) and there was no active endotoxin in solutions.
Pre-treatment of HMEC with AG490 (50µM), a kinase
inhibitor of JAK2 and EGFR, partially prevented EGFR
phosphorylation (by 45%; n=6; P<0.01).
By adding an HA motif at its N-terminus, we
produced a tagged rhHSP70 that was used to distinguish
the exogenous from the endogenous proteins. The
purified rhHSP70-HA molecule was a single 70-kDa
protein as much functional as the commercially available

Heat shock and exogenous HSP70 were shown to
activate toll-like receptors (TLR) 2 and 4, as well as to
promote their association with the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) and the receptor phosphorylation [6].
Since TLR2 is not detected in HMEC, we hypothesized
that rhHSP70 may transactivate EGFR through its
interaction with TLR4. Accordingly, the rhHSP70-induced
EGFR phosphorylation was prevented by the neutralizing
AbTLR4 antibody while being unaffected by PMB (Fig.
3A).

Extracellular rhHSP70 induces intracellular Ca2+
mobilization

recombinant molecule (Suppl. Fig. S4). rhHSP70-HA was
observed to be internalized into serum-starved HMEC
within 5 minutes, and to partially co-localize with EGFR
(Fig. 3C).
The AKT activation, which is crucial to disrupt
GJIC by causing phosphorylation of Ser368 in Cx43 [43,
44], was rapidly induced by rhHSP70 (within 5 min) in a
TLR4-dependent manner (Fig. 3D). The EGFR tyrosine
kinase inhibitor, gefitinib (10µM) also antagonized
the inhibitory effect of rhHSP70 on GJIC (Fig. 3E).
Altogether, our data suggest that rhHSP70 transactivates
EGFR.

Since EGFR engagement activates a calciumdependent signaling [45, 46], we measured the 340/380
nm ratio of fura-2 fluorescence, reflecting the cytosolic
[Ca2+]i in PM-pretreated, fura-2-loaded HMEC (Fig.
4A, upper trace). In nominally Ca2+-free bath conditions,
rhHSP70 induced a transient increase in [Ca2+]i within
1–3 min, which was followed by three or more Ca2+
waves. These oscillations, never spontaneously observed

HMEC. Data are expressed as the 340/380 nm excitation ratio in one cell to observe oscillations in [Ca2+]i because the oscillatory process
is not synchronized in cells of the same monolayer. External additions of drugs are indicated by arrows. Changes in external calcium bath
conditions are indicated on the bottom of traces. In most cases, drugs were initially applied in the absence (0 Ca) then in Ca2+ (1.8 mM)
containing solution to reveal Ca2+ release from internal stores then external Ca2+ entry, respectively (representative from 50 cells; n=10).
No calcium increase was induced by the cell superfusion of the control bath solution (middle trace) while thapsigargin (TSG 4µM) always
produced a drastic increase in [Ca2+]i (lower trace; Representative from 50 cells; n=4). B. Contribution of EGFR to rhHSP70-induced
Ca2+ signaling. Superimposed traces from cells preincubated with the EGFR (ErbB1) inhibitor, gefitinib (10 µM for 30 min; in red),

its inactive analog U-73343 (5 µM) on the rhHSP70-induced Ca2+ oscillations. Drugs were applied without (0 Ca) then with extracellular
Ca2+ (1.8 mM) (representative from 50 cells; n=5). D. Ca2+ oscillations required both Ca2+ release from internal stores and store operated
Ca2+ entry (SOCE). Cells were pretreated with the selective SOCE inhibitor, BTP-2 (20 µM; 20 min), before challenged with rhHSP70
(Representative from 30 cells; n=4).

in control (middle trace), could be prevented by the
selective inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase,
thapsigargin (4µM), suggesting that rhHSP70 recruits
Ca2+ from intracellular stores (lower trace). Furthermore,
rhHSP70 induced phosphorylation of AKT, ERK and
SAPK/JNK within 5–10 min, which was significantly
attenuated by the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA/AM (Suppl. Fig.
S5).
The EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, gefitinib (10
µM), attenuated the Ca2+ signal elicited by rhHSP70, i.e.
the initial peak amplitude was decreased at 56 ± 3% of
the control amplitude (n=20; P<0.05; Fig. 4B). These
results demonstrate that an amplification loop involving
intracellular calcium and EGFR activation mediates the
effects of rhHSP70 in HMEC.
EGFR transactivation is known to stimulate
phospholipase C (PLC), leading to inositol
1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) formation and release of
Ca2+ from InsP3-sensitive Ca2+-stores. The extracellular
application of U-73122 (5 µM), an inhibitor of PLC,
reduced both the number and amplitude of rhHSP70evoked Ca2+ oscillations (Fig. 4C) [47]. In contrast,
the same dose of its inactive analog, U-73343, had no
effect. Furthermore, the cell pretreatment with BTP-2
(20 µM), a cell-permeable blocker of store-operated Ca2+
entry (SOCE), decreased both frequency and amplitude
of Ca2+ oscillations without affecting the initial peak of
Ca2+ release and the basal [Ca2+]i (Fig. 4D). Pretreatment
with 2-APB (50 µM), a blocker of InsP3 receptors [48],
decreased basal [Ca2+]i and suppressed Ca2+ oscillations.
Thus, intracellular Ca2+ oscillations evoked by rhHSP70
are related to the initial release of Ca2+ from InsP3sensitive intracellular Ca2+-stores.

The remaining ATP release, also observed in control cells,
was unable to evoke Ca2+ oscillations in HMEC (Fig. 5D)
and could be blocked by the vesicular transport inhibitor
brefeldin A (20 µM; not shown).
Recent evidence emerged indicating that a crossinhibition of pannexin (Panx) channels, especially Panx1, by mimetic peptides (Gap26) and carbenoxolone, is
involved in ATP release and Ca2+ currents in various cell
types [49]. Therefore we tested a specific inhibitor of
Panx-1, probenecid (Prb), at a dose that does not affect
Cx channels [50]. Prb reduced rhHSP70-evoked Ca2+
oscillations without affecting the initial peak (Fig. 5E) and
totally blocked the rhHSP70-evoked ATP (Fig. 5F). The
total inhibition of cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations was achieved
with Gap26. When the Cx43 expression was reduced by
siRNA (Fig. 5F), the rhHSP70-induced ATP release was
significantly decreased (by 40%), and further abolished by
Prb (Fig. 5F).

HSP70 release from stimulated human monocytes
prevents heterocellular GJIC with HMEC
The release of ATP and subsequent activation of
endothelial intracellular Ca2+ signalling are reported to
modulate monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells and their
transendothelium migration [23, 51]. Exposure of human,
peripheral blood monocytes to M-CSF for 12 hours
increased the expression and release of HSP70, without
affecting Cx43 expression and phosphorylation (Fig.
6A, B, C). The amount of HSP70 secreted by monocytes
seems very low compared with the exogenously added
in HMEC cultures. However this was a dosage for the
whole fluid bathing the cells whereas the secretion by
monocytes must be considered in their closed vicinity near
the endothelial cell. So the real quantity of HSP70 secreted
by the monocyte and collected by the endothelial cell is
certainly much higher that the dose measured (diluted) in
the whole bath. Knocking down HSP70 with a specific
siRNA reduced by about 80% the amount of HSP70 found
after 12 h into the bath of M-CSF-treated monocytes (Fig.
6D). M-CSF-stimulated monocytes increased ATP release
by HMEC, which could be mediated by HSP70 released
from these monocytes (Fig. 6E).
To evaluate the impact of released HSP70 on the
establishment of GJIC between monocytes and HMEC,
these monocytes were double loaded with calcein, a dye
that is able to pass through gap junctions, and with DiL,
a membrane-bound stain used to distinguish cell donor
(monocyte) from recipient cells (HMEC) (Fig. 6F).
Note that calcein is an intracellular dye that becomes
fluorescent after hydrolysis by cytosolic esterases [52].
After hydrolysis, calcein is highly charged and therefore
impermeable to cell membranes; it is thought to travel
from cell to cell through gap junctions [35, 53]. DiL,
conversely, does not travel from cell to cell [54]. Preloaded

Ca2+ mobilization and GJIC blockage are
partially dependent on ATP release by HMEC
Extracellular ATP inactivation with apyrase (20 U/
ml) significantly reduced both the frequency and amplitude
of [Ca2+]i oscillations while keeping fairly conserved the
amplitude of the initial Ca2+ peak (Fig. 5A). Moreover,
apyrase partially antagonized the blocking action of
rhHSP70 on GJIC (Fig. 5B). Cell exposure to rhHSP70
induced a significant release of ATP as demonstrated using
the luciferin-luciferase bioluminescence assay (Fig. 5C).
Given that rhHSP70-induced cytosolic Ca2+
oscillations in HMEC depend, at least in part, on the
release of ATP and subsequent P2 purinergic receptor
activation, we supposed that Cx43 hemichannels could act
as a putative pathway of ATP release. Inhibition of Cx43
channels, either with 18βGA (10 μM, n=2; not shown)
or with the mimetic peptide Gap26 (500 µM) totally
suppressed the rhHSP70-induced ATP release from HMEC
(Fig. 5C) and significantly attenuated rhHSP70-induced
Ca2+ response, especially the oscillatory process (Fig. 5D).

monocytes were then plated with unlabeled HMEC
monolayer. After 3 hours of co-culture, unstimulated
monocytes remained in suspension, whereas M-CSFtreated cells adhered to the endothelial monolayer (Fig.

addition of rhHSP70 to the bath reversed it. The gapjunction blockers, carbenoxolone (200 µM) and 18βGA
(500 µM) similarly blocked this heterocellular dye transfer
(not shown). These results make clear that released HSP70
prevents cell-to-cell communication between monocytes
and HMEC.
Dye coupling was also seen with the non-transfected
monocytes pretreated by the adenosine derived inhibitor
of HSP70, VER155008 (Fig. 7A), i.e. VER155008treated cells established functional gap junctions with
HMEC in response to M-CSF. VER155008 treatment did
not change the high level of HSP70 protein expressed in
cells stimulated by M-CSF (Fig. 7B). Treatment of HMEC
alone by VER155008 improved the blocking action of
rhHSP70 on GJIC (Fig. 7C).
To explore the role of Cx43 in monocyteendothelial cell interactions, HMEC were transfected
with siRNA Cx43 or control siRNA, and intercellular
communication was tested 48 h later (Fig. 7D). Control
HMEC cultures (transfected with control siRNA) showed
extensive dye transfer of calcein from M-CSF-treated
siRNA HSP70 monocytes (on average of 7 neighboring
cells). The siRNA-mediated knockdown of Cx43 in
endothelial cells did not affect the adhesion monocytes,
but abolished (reduced by more 90% from control levels)
the heterocellular GJIC. Upon stimulation by M-CSF, the
transendothelial migration of monocytes in which HSP70
has been decreased by siRNA was strongly increased as
compared to control cells (Fig. 7E). This “diapedesis”
increase was abolished by knocking down the endothelial
Cx43 expression.

has been less explored [8, 11, 55]. Here, we show that
extracellular HSP70 specifically decreases expression
of Cx43 at the plasma membrane and induces hyperphosphorylation of Cx43 in a time-dependent manner,
leading to GJIC blockage. Since a reduced expression
of Cx43 in endothelial cells has been shown to decrease
the formation of vessels in Matrigel [19], this decreased
expression may explain why rhHSP70 affects the
spreading pattern of endothelial cells as compared to the
typical sprouting when exposed to VEGF. The decreased
expression of Cx43 in response to HSP70 is associated
with the phosphorylation of its serine residues, which
was shown to regulate gap junction channel formation,
permeability, and turnover in other cell types [38]. In
addition, rhHSP70 inhibits the ZO-1/Cx43 interaction at
the plasma membrane, reducing the amount of Cx43 at
the cell surface. Accordingly to Palatinus and coworkers
[56], we confirm that inhibition of this interaction favors
phosphorylation on Ser368. Specific phosphorylation of
Cx43 has also been observed to promote GJIC inhibition
in rat microvascular endothelial cells exposed to LPS [28].
HSP70 was observed to physically interact with
TLR4, which transactivates EGFR. Inhibition of TLR4 and its downstream signaling cascade with specific
neutralizing antibodies efficiently suppressed HSP70induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR in HMEC.
The use of kinase inhibitors suggested that EGFR
transactivation may only slightly depend on intrinsic
EGFR tyrosine and Src kinase activities, but may require
kinase activity that is partially inhibited by the tyrphostin
AG490.
In several cell types including HMEC [57, 58],
EGFR activation elicits an initial Ca2+ peak that depends
on inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP3) through induction
of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, followed by
a plateau phase dependent on a secondary Ca2+ entry
from the extracellular compartment. The oscillatory
behavior of secondary Ca2+ entry depends on the cell
type. Extracellular HSP70 induces such a biphasic Ca2+
response in HMEC, i.e. an initial peak followed by [Ca2+]i
oscillations in nominally Ca2+-free external conditions.
As already described in EGF-treated cells [59], the source
of Ca2+ responsible for these oscillations is the InsP3sensitive endoplasmic reticulum (ER) store. Due to the
modulation of InsP3 receptors by Ca2+, the “pacemarker”
elevation which precedes the spikes could be explained
by a slowly rising level of [Ca2+]i released by InsP3 until
a threshold [Ca2+]i is reached to elicit the rapid upstroke
[60, 61]. By using BTP-2, a blocker of store-operated
Ca2+ entry (SOCE), and 2-APB, a potent blocker of
InsP3 receptors, we show intracellular Ca2+ oscillations
evoked by rhHSP70 are mainly due to the release of Ca2+
from InsP3-sensitive Ca2+-stores although the frequency
of oscillations require calcium entry across the plasma
membrane.
Release of ATP was shown to promote an oscillatory

DISCUSSION
The major contribution of our study is the
demonstration that extracellular HSP70, exogenously
added or released from human circulating monocytes
in response to M-CSF induction, activates a signaling
cascade that decreases GJIC activity between HMEC and
HMEC/monocytes reducing monocyte transmigration
through the endothelium (Fig. 8). Thereby, HSP70 release
may play a regulatory role in monocyte diapedesis when
invading tissues to differentiate into macrophages or
osteoclasts, depending on tissue microenvironment.
Therapeutic manipulation of this pathway would be a
strategy in various diseases such as chronic inflammatory
diseases, osteoporosis, and cancer.

well understood. Rather, adhesion complexes such as
tight junctions and adherens junctions are established as
regulators of permeability at the membrane, restricting
paracellular flux [69]. From our observations, it is unlikely
that the gap junctions contribute in adhesive function. Our
studies also exclude a significant role of connexins as
opening hemi-channels. Therefore, the connexins likely
participate in the permeability response to inflammatory
stimuli through their function in intercellular GJIC,
by facilitating the intercellular exchange of signal that
coordinate or enhance the response. In addition to Ca2+
ions, micro RNA may also pass through gap junctions,
suggesting it as an additional candidate among signaling
molecules [70]. Moreover, our data suggest that M-CSF, as
secreted by endothelial cells in atherogenesis, contribute to
the accumulation of monocytes at the site of inflammation
by stimulating HSP70 release and subsequently inhibiting
monocytes transmigration. Similar mechanisms could be
involved in cancers where monocytes accumulation has
deleterious effects [71].
Homocellular and heterocellular cross-talks
between monocytes and endothelial cells involve multiple
receptor-ligand complexes and ion channels, including
gap junctions and their connexin protein building blocks,

increase in cytosolic Ca2+ [62] , underlying the paracrine
intercellular communication [63-67]. Here we demonstrate
that extracellular HSP70 leads to an immediate and robust
release of ATP by HMEC. The Cx43 inhibition (Gap26) or
knockdown only attenuated the ATP release from HSP70treated HMEC, suggesting Cx43-hemichannels contribute
but are not mainly involved in rhHSP70-induced ATP
release. Note that a reduction of Cx43 expression not only
lead to a reduction of gap junction function, but also might
trigger more complex cellular alterations. In contrast,
inhibition (Prb) of Panx-1 function or suppression of its
expression (Suppl. Fig. S6) totally abolished rhHSP70induced ATP release [49, 50, 68]. On the basis of inhibitor
data and siRNA experiments, we conclude that Panx-1
channels mainly contribute to the observed rhHSP70evoked ATP.
Taken together, our experiments indicate that HSP70
released from M-CSF-treated monocytes does not affect
monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells but prevents cellcell communication between monocytes and HMEC.
Note that Ca2+ chelation did not affect monocyte adhesion
but slowed down monocyte transmigration through
human microvascular endothelium [51]. The role of gap
junctions in endothelial paracellular permeability is not

Fig 8: Hypothetical model of the inhibitory effects of extracellular HSP70 on the diapedesis of monocytes. The diagram

shows the distribution of gap-junctions (double barrel) and hemichannels (single barrel) that can operate between monocytes (M) and
endothelial cells of the microvascular wall. M-CSF-stimulated monocytes adhere to the endothelial cell monolayer and release HSP70
that disrupts GJIC between EC contributing to the subsequent release of ATP through Panx-1 and Cx43 hemichannels from endothelial
cells. Extracellular HSP70 induce endothelial Ca2+ oscillations without affecting the intercellular tight junction protein, localized between
apposed cells. When HSP70 is blocked (siRNA or VER155008), M-CSF-stimulated monocytes communicate with endothelial cells by
gap junctions (GJIC), allowing their migration across the endothelial cell monolayer, in an endothelial Ca2+-dependent mechanism (slowed
down by BAPTA, a Ca2+ chelator, Suppl. Fig. S5).

which have been compared to immunological synapses
[72]. By targeting connexins and the channels they form,
HSP70 may be part of the complex cascade of molecular
interactions that underpin the rolling of monocytes on the
endothelial wall. HSP70 interaction with TLR4, Cx43
phosphorylation and decreased expression, ATP release,
and Ca2+ oscillations, providing several potential targets
to therapeutically modulate the transendothelial migration
of monocytes.

To avoid endotoxin contamination of rhHSP, cells
were preincubated with polymyxin B (PMB, 10 µM; 30-60
min) and rhHSP70 solutions were also treated with PMB
prior to their use. To block TLR4, cells were preincubated
with the neutralizing anti-hTLR4 antibody (10 µg/ml; for
30 min).

Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching
(FRAP)

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells

The GJIC between HMEC was measured by means
of gap-FRAP method [30]. Cells were loaded with 10
ng/µl of calcein/AM for 15 min. The fluorescence of
investigated cells was bleached at 405 nm. The recovery
of fluorescence was measured at 488 nm every 20 sec for a
time period of 8 min. The fluorescence in one unbleached
cell was used to correct the artefact loss of fluorescence.
The permeability of gap junctions is estimated by the
diffusion rate constant k (expressed in min-1) determined
from recovery curves as following: (Fi - Ft)/(Fi – F0)=e-kt,
where Fi, Ft and F0 are intensities before bleaching, at
time t and t=0 respectively.

Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC;
Lonza; Basel, Switzerland) were grown in DMEM plus
10% FCS (5% CO2; 37°C). Human peripheral blood
monocytes were isolated from buffy coats of healthy
donors by Ficoll gradient (MACS system, Miltenyi
Biotec Inc., Paris, Fr). CD14 monocytes isolated beads
were plated in RPMI1640 plus 10% FCS and stimulated
overnight by 100 ng/mL recombinant human macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF; Millipore, Molsheim,
Fr). Untouched monocytes were nucleoporated with
siRNA using Amaxa nucleofector kit (Amaxa; Koln,
Germany) and HMEC were transfected by lipofectamine
RNAiMAX (Invitrogen; Life Technologies, Saint-Aubin,
Fr). siRNA HSP70 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(SASI_Hs01_00051449; Saint-Quentin Fallavier, Fr),
siRNA Cx43 was from Santa Cruz Biotech (GJA1_human
mapping 6q22.31; Clinisciences; Nanterre, Fr) and control
siRNA was from Dharmacon (Fermentas; ThermoFischer,
Saint-Remy-les-Chevreuses, Fr). Cells were incubated
overnight in FCS-free media before use.

Immunofluorescence and Imaging
Cells were fixed in 4% PAF and permeabilized
with 0.1% Triton X-100 [31]. Images were performed
using a Leica SP2 RS confocal microscope (Z-series
of optical sections from 0.3-0.6 µm intervals; 512x512
pixels; Rueil-Malmaison, Fr). For co-localization, images
were taken on Axio Imager 2 (Carl Zeiss GmbH) with an
Apotome2 module (Optical sections of 0.5 µm; 512x512;
Oberkochen, Germany).

Briefly, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer, and
immunoprecipitation was performed with antibodies, as
previously described [31].

Transendothelial cell migration
HMEC were cultured on 3-µm membrane pores
of Transwell inserts until confluency, then FCS-free
overnight (CytoSelectTM, Cell Biolabs; Euromedex,
Mundolsheim, Fr). 300 µl of monocytes suspension were
added (3x105 cells per well). After 3-hours, migrated cells
were labeled with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD14+
antibody and counted by flow cytometry.

Recombinant protein production
Heat Shock 70kDa protein 1B (HSPA1B) [Homo
sapiens] modified with HA Tag in Nter (rhHSP70-HA)
has been produced by Proteogenix (Oberhausbergen,
France). The rhHSP70 cDNA was cloned in pT7-MAT-1
expression vector in E.coli with His tag1 in N-terminal
position (Cloning strategy: Hind III / Eco RI2). His tag is
intended for affinity purification.

Statistical analysis
One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA; Statview
Software) was used to compare data groups of at least
five independent experiments. Stimulated samples were
compared to controls by two-tailed, unpaired t-tests. *P
values < 0.05 were significant.

Cytosolic Ca2+ concentration
Changes in 340/380 nm ratio of Fura-2 fluorescence
were used to measure [Ca2+]i. Briefly, cells were incubated
with 2 µM fura-2-AM (40 min at 37°C), then in HEPESbuffered saline solution (HBSS) as previously described
[33]. Measurements were made on Axiovert 40 (Carl
Zeiss) with a 20X objective (fluor, 0.75 NA) attached to a
dual-excitation spectrofluorimeter (340/380 nm). Emission
