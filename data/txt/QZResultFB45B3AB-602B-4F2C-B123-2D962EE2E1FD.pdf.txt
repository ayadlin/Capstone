ABSTRACT
Although there were considerable advances in the anti-aging medical field, it
is short of therapeutic drug for anti-aging. Mounting evidence indicates that the
immunosenescence is the key physiopathological mechanism of aging. This study
showed the treatment of LW-AFC, an herbal medicine, decreased the grading score
of senescence, increased weight, prolonged average life span and ameliorated spatial
memory impairment in 12- and 24-month-old senescence accelerated mouse resistant
1 (SAMR1) strain. And these anti-aging effects of LW-AFC were more excellent
than melatonin. The administration of LW-AFC enhanced ConA- and LPS-induced
splenocyte proliferation in aged SAMR1 mice. The treatment of LW-AFC not only
reversed the decreased the proportions of helper T cells, suppressor T cells and B
cells, the increased regulatory T cells in the peripheral blood of old SAMR1 mice,
but also could modulate the abnormal secretion of IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-17, IL-23,
GM-CSF, IFN-γ, TNF-α, TNF-β, RANTES, eotaxin, MCP-1, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and G-CSF.
These data indicated that LW-AFC reversed the immunosenescence status by restoring
immunodeficiency and decreasing chronic inflammation and suggested LW-AFC may
be an effective anti-aging agent.

INTRODUCTION

aging interventions have received good press. Such as
caloric restriction [9, 16], spermidine [17], metformin [18,
19], resveratrol [20, 21], and rapamycin [22]. However,
these interventions showed significantly negative side
effects, including danger of malnutrition [23], nausea,
gastrointestinal discomfort, nephrotoxicity [24], potent
immunosuppression [25], and adverse effects [26].
For the mechanism underlying aging, mounting
evidence indicates the immune system undergoes serious
deterioration with age and the immunosenescence plays
the key role in aging [27, 28]. Immunosenescence has
been defined as the age-associated decrease in immune

Aging is characterized by time-dependent loss
of physiological integrity, leading to impaired function
and increased vulnerability to disease [1]. And aging
is a complex process that deeply affected by genomic
instability [2], telomere attrition [3, 4], epigenetic
alterations [5, 6], loss of proteostasis [7], deregulated
nutrient sensing [8, 9], mitochondrial dysfunction [1012], cellular senescence [13], stem cell exhaustion [14,
15], etc. Because of the intrinsic complexities to the
multifactorial causes underlying aging, few proposed

competence that renders individuals more susceptible to
diseases and increases morbidity and mortality due to
infections and a variety of other age-related pathologies
[29]. If we want to couple a longer lifespan with healthy
ageing, it is imperative to develop intervention strategies
to reduce the effects of immunosenescence. However,
numerous kinds of cells and factors were involved in
the process of immunosenescence which the key points
contain progressively adaptive immune system inability
and chronic inflammation with ageing [30]. Thus, when
evaluating therapeutic interventions for extenuating or
antagonizing transformations with age, any correction of
immune system dysfunctions must be accompanied by an
anti-inflammatory responses [31, 32].
LW-AFC is consisted of 20.3% polysaccharide
fraction (LWB-B), 15.1% glycosides fraction (LWD-b)
and 64.6% oligosaccharide fraction (CA-30), which are
extracted main active components from Liuwei Dihuang
decoction. Liuwei Dihuang decoction is comprised
of Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch., Cornus officinalis
Sieb., Dioscorea opposita Thunb., Alisma orientale (G.
Samuelsson) Juz, Poria cocos (Schw.) Wolf and Paeonia
suffruticosa Andrews in the weight ratio 8:4:4:3:3:3.
Liuwei Dihuang decoction is a classical traditional
Chinese medicine (TCM) prescription with a history
of thousand years for improving or restoring declined
functions related to aging process and geriatric diseases
including hypertension [13], diabetes [14], osteoporosis
[15], dementia [16, 17].
Senescence accelerated mouse resistant 1 (SAMR1)
strain, one of three litters of mice resistant to accelerated
aging was derived from AKR/J strain and established by
Toshio Takeda and colleagues [10], represent a normal
aging control. The senescence process of SAMR1 mice
show normal development and maturation. The degree of
senescence at 8-months-old SAMR1 mice is 3.4 [9], the
median survival time is 568 days, these value corresponds
to those of common strains [11]. In autopsy findings,
SAMR1 mice show non-thymic lymphoma, histiocytic
sarcoma and ovarian cysts [12]. Thus, SAMR1 mice
provide an excellent experimental model control for
verifying the effect of accelerated aging repeatedly.
In present study we found long-term oral
administration of LW-AFC, an herbal medicine, delayed
appearance of aging in old SAMR1 mice, which were
more excellent than melatonin, an indoleamine as
a pharmacological anti-aging intervention [42-44]
with immunomodulatory activity [45, 46] and antiinflammatory capability [47-49]. Furthermore, we
found LW-AFC not only effected on immune system
dysfunctions but also on inflammatory responses.

The treatment of LW-AFC slowed the aging
process of old SAMR1 mice
In order to investigate the effects of LW-AFC on
aging, we detected the influence of LW-AFC on the
appearance of aging. Results showed the treatment of LWAFC had effects on the grading score of senescence, life
span and weight except for spontaneous locomotor activity
(Figure 1B).
LW-AFC had delaying effects on aging process of old
SAMR1 mice
Results showed the grading score being used to
evaluate the degree of senescence in 12- and 24-monthold SAMR1 mice was significantly higher than that in
7-month-old SAMR1 and ICR mice (Figure 1A). After
treatment of LW-AFC, the grading score in two different
month SAMR1 mice was decreased. The decreased
grading score induced by the treatment of LW-AFC in 12and 24-month-old SAMR1 mice was observed at 30 and
45 days after treatment respectively, while the treatment of
melatonin could not change the grading score in 12- and
24-month-old SAMR1 mice (Figure 1A). This indicated
that the treatment of LW-AFC delayed the aging process
of SAMR1 mice.
The impact of LW-AFC on the average life span and
weight of old SAMR1 mice
The life span of each 12- and 24-month-old SAMR1
mouse was recorded until 150 days after treatment of
LW-AFC. The data showed the treatment of LW-AFC
increased the average life span (Figure 1C) and median
survival time (Figure 1D) in 12-month-old SAMR1 mice
but melatonin not. While treatment with melatonin or LWAFC failed to produce a significant increase in the average
life span (Figure 1C) and median survival time (Figure
1D) in 24-month-old SAMR1 mice. The average weight of
12- and 24-month-old SAMR1 mice showed significantly
increased after being treated with LW-AFC, while the
treatment of melatonin decreased weight in 12-monthold SAMR1 mice and increased in 24-month-old SAMR1
mice (Figure 1E and 1F).

The treatment of LW-AFC improved spatial
memory defects of old SAMR1 mice
To examine the ability of spatial learning and
memory of SAMR1 mice, Morris water maze test was
employed. In the learning task (Figure 2), there was no
significant difference between the escape latency of each
group. In the probe trial, the number of crossing the plate
of 12- and 24-month-old SAMR1 mice was significantly

increased by LW-AFC administration, escape latency and
time in the target quadrant were not significantly different
among groups. We did not find the effects of melatonin on
spatial learning and memory defects in SAMR1 mice. This
data indicated that LW-AFC administration significantly
improved spatial memory of 12- and 24-month-old
SAMR1 mice.

spontaneous splenocyte proliferation of 12-month-old
SAMR1 mice (Figure 3). The treatment of LW-AFC or
melatonin significantly increased ConA- and LPS-induced

mice (Figure 3). This indicated that the function of T and

of 12-month-old SAMR1 mice were only significantly
decreased compared with ICR mice, and that of 24-monthold SAMR1 mice were significantly less than both young
mice (Figure 4C). Treatment with melatonin was found to
be able to reverse CD3+ CD4+ and CD3+ CD8+ T cells of
12- and 24-month-old SAMR1 mice, ratio of CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells of 12-month-old SAMR1 mice, and CD3+
CD25+Foxp3+T cells of 24-month-old SAMR1 mice
(Figure 4B, 4C, 4D and 4E). The CD3+ T cells, ratio of
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, CD3+ CD25+Foxp3+T cells of
24-month-old SAMR1 mice were improved by LW-AFC
administration, CD3+ CD4+ and CD3+ CD8+ T cells of
both old SAMR1 mice were also reversed by LW-AFC
(Figure 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D and 4E). The B cells of 12- and
24-month-old SAMR1 mice were significantly more than
that in ICR mice, and less than 7-month-old SAMR1
mice, while after treatment with LW-AFC and melatonin,
B cells of both old SAMR1 mice were increased compared
with control groups (Figure 4F). This indicated that the
lymphocyte subsets in old SAMR1 mice were disorder

In order to investigate the effect of LW-AFC on
chronic inflammation, the levels of a number of cytokines

TNF-β, RANTES, eotaxin, MCP-1, MIP-1β, IL-4, IL-5,

bead analysis. The results (Figure 5) showed that some
cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17, GM-CSF, IFN-γ, TNF-α,
TNF-β, RANTES, eotaxin) were significantly elevated,
and some (MIP-1β, MCP-1, IL-23, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10) were
significantly increased with ageing. In addition, the level of
IL-2 in SAMR1 mice gradually increased since 13 months
of age compared with 7-month-old ICR and SAMR1 mice,
and it was no significant difference from 26 months of
age (Figure 5B). Instead, G-CSF in SAMR1 mice was
lower than 7-month-old ICR and SAMR1 mice at 12 and
13 months of age, and significantly increased from 24
months of age (Figure 5Q). After being administered with

that in the advanced stage (24 months of age).

inflammatory cytokines, leading to a chronic, low-grade,
pro-inflammatory condition named “inflammaging” [27,
29, 72, 73]. Elevated concentration of pro-inflammatory
cytokines and decreased level anti-inflammatory cytokines
are correlated with an increased risk of morbidity and
mortality in elderly. For example, elevated levels of IL-6
are associated with impaired functioning in the activities
of daily living [74], and slower gait velocity [75]. IL-6
also stimulates osteoclastogenesis and osteoclastic activity,
while shortening osteoblast survival [76-81]. With aging,
inflammatory cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines
lead to overexpression of adhesion molecules and
procoagulant agents [82]. Local arterial vasoconstriction
could be induced by TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10 through the
impact on the endothelium and synthesis of nitric acid
[83]. In addition, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-α modify
endothelial function, which leading to prothrombotic state
with inhibition of fibrinolysis and activation of coagulation
pathways [84]. Furthermore, IL-2, IL-17, IL-23, TNF-β,
GM-CSF, MCP-1, RANTES, eotaxin, IL-4, IL-5, IL10 and G-CSF are also closely related with cognitive
decline with ageing, synaptic or neuronal loss [85-91],
osteoarthritis [92, 93] cancer [94], lung senescence [95].
Moreover, disturbance of cytokines are involved with
nutritional status [96-98], bone metabolism [76, 79-81, 99]
and muscle metabolism [100-102] of old individuals. In
the present study, LW-AFC could regulated the abnormal
level of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6,
IL-17, IL-23, GM-CSF, IFN-γ, TNF-α, TNF-β, RANTES,
eotaxin, MCP-1, and anti-inflammatory cytokines IL4, IL-5, IL-10 and G-CSF in old SAMR1 mice, and this
suggested that anti-aging effects of LW-AFC may be via
decreasing chronic inflammation.
In previous study, the grading scores increased
steadily with advancing age in SAMR1 mice, the grading
scores in SAMR1 mice levelled out at 24 months of age
(~8.2) were significantly higher than that at 12 months
of age (~3.0) [10]. And our results were consistent with
previous reports (10.69 ± 2.53 vs. 7.25 ± 2.24, P <
0.0001). Moreover, the quantity of CD3+ CD4+ T cells
(P < 0.0001), CD3+ CD8+ T cells (P = 0.0026), ratio of
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (P < 0.0001), and CD19+ B cells
cells (P = 0.0011) of 12-month-old SAMR1 mice were
significantly higher than 24-month-old SAMR1. These
indicated that immunodeficiency degree of 12-month-old
SAMR1 mice was higher than 24-month-old SAMR1.
Furthermore, the chronic inflammation phenotype
between the two time points of SAMR1 mice. The degree
of chronic inflammation in 12-month-old SAMR1 mice
(-2.11 ± 1.94) was lower than 24-month-old SAMR1 mice
(1.67 ± 1.38). Therefore, 24-month-old SAMR1 mice
were not only older than 12-month-old SAMR1 mice
in physiological age, but also in immunodeficiency and
chronic inflammation. The high-grade immunodeficiency
and chronic inflammation in 24-month-old SAMR1 mice
caused irreversible physiological aging. This might be

DISCUSSION
One of the major features of human
immunosenescence is immunodeficiency, because of
thymic involution characterized by a progressive, agerelated thymic epithelial cell loss and thymopoiesis
impairment of the thymus [50-53]. The effectiveness of
the immune response descends with age, specifically in the
latter stages of life [54-56]. Among the multiple complex
factors that contribute to the age-associated changes
of immunological function in humans, the decline in
CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responsiveness is one of the most
profound and consistent [57, 58]. A hallmark of age-related
hypoimmunity is reduced humoral responses, and CD4+ T
cells play a central role in the humoral response through
their B cell helper functions [58]. Similar to CD4+ T cells,
with increasing age there is a deterioration in CD8+ T-cell
responsiveness to newly encountered antigens in older
individuals [59]. CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells
(Treg), play important roles in both the immune system
and the nervous system. The accumulation Tregs with
advanced age, which in turn could deteriorate cytotoxic
activity of CD8+ T and NK cells [60], was reported as a
neuroprotective immunomodulator in AD [61-63]. The
humoral immune response maintained by the B cell
compartment are waned with age [64]. The percentage and
numbers of total B cells, as defined by CD19 expression,
decrease with age [65-67]. Aging also leads to the
limited diversity of B cells that are available to respond
to infection or challenge [65]. Therefore, deficiency of
these lymphocytes will pose the aged organisms with the
risk of new pathogen invasion and raised susceptibility to
infection. In the present experiment, the administration
of LW-AFC significantly increased the deduction of
CD4+, CD8+ T-cell, CD4/CD8 ratio and CD19+ B-cell
in the peripheral blood in old SAMR1 mice. Besides
the lymphocyte quantities, the body resistance against
infection, inflammatory illnesses or senescence also rely
on the proliferation activity of lymphocytes. Studies have
shown that obstruction of T lymphocyte proliferation
may contribute to immunodeficiency related increasing
age [68]. Our data also demonstrated that LW-AFC could
augment the splenocyte proliferation in old SAMR1 mice.
Based on modulating lymphocyte subsets of helper T
cells, suppressor T cells, B cells, and regulatory T cells,
and enhancing splenocyte proliferation, we inferred that
restoring immunodeficiency may be one way for antiaging of LW-AFC.
Accumulating studies show that senescence is

the reason why anti-aging effectiveness of LW-AFC on
24-month-old SAMR1 mice was inferior to 12 months of
age.
Taken together, our data demonstrated that LWAFC possessed anti-aging activity and this effects might
be through reversing immunodeficiency and decreasing
chronic inflammation. LW-AFC may be a potential
therapeutic agent for aging.

housing conditions (room temperature 22±1°C and
humidity of 55±5%) with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle, and
were fed pellet food (provided by the animal center of the
AMMS). They were allowed free access to water and food.
Two or three mice were kept in each cage. Each mouse
was identified by coloring its fur with picric acid. All
behavioral tests were performed between 19:00 p.m. and
6:00 a.m. (Beijing time). The animal treatment, husbandry
and experimental protocols in this study were approved by
the Institute of Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)
of the National Beijing Center for Drug Safety Evaluation
and Research (NBCDSER).
Twelve and twenty-four months SAMR1 mice were
separated into 6 groups at random: 4 treatment groups, 2
SAMR1 control group, and each group had 16 mice (half
male and half female). Seven-month-old SAMR1 and
ICR-CD1 mice were served as young control (10 males).
LW-AFC was dissolved in distilled water at 160 mg/mL,
melatonin (Sigma Chemical Co. St. Louis, MO, USA) to
0.1 mg/mL. The mice in drug treated groups were given
intragastric administration of melatonin or LW-AFC (0.1
mL/10 g body weight) daily for 150 days. SAMR1 mice as
control group and the young control groups were given an
equal volume of deionized water. The mice were weighed
every 3 days, and evaluated the degree of senescence and
locomotor activity every 15 days for 75 days. During the
last two weeks of administration, all groups of animals
were subjected to Morris water maze test. Following
the behavioral experiment, the plasma was collected for
cytokine, spleens for lymphocyte proliferation assay and
lymphocytes subsets analysis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Preparation of LW-AFC and HPLC analysis
LW-AFC was prepared from Liuwei Dihuang
decoction and includes polysaccharide fraction (LWB-B),
glycosides fraction (LWD-b) and oligosaccharide fraction
(CA-30). Liuwei Dihuang decoction was prepared as
previously described in Yang’s [103], Zhang’s [104, 105]
and Cheng’s [106, 107] study. After the prepared Liuwei
Dihuang decoction was filtered by 6-layer gauze, the
extraction solutions was centrifuged. The supernatant
was concentrated into quintessence. The quintessence
was extracted in ethanol to produce the supernatant
(LWD), the sedimentation left in deionized water was
concentrated into dried polysaccharide fraction (LWB-B).
The ethanol elution fraction of the LWD, dissolved by
macroporous adsorptive resins, to obtain glycosides
component (LWD-b). And the water elution fraction of
the LWD, dissolved by active carbon absorption column,
to obtain oligosaccharide component (CA-30). LW-AFC
was composed of 20.3% polysaccharide component
(LWB-B), 15.1% glycosides component (LWD-b) and
64.6% oligosaccharide component (CA-30) in the dry
weight ratio.
The components of LW-AFC were analyzed using
HPLC. Briefly, for mixture of CA-30 and LWD-b,
the chromatographic separation was obtained on a
Diamond C18 column, there are 17 chromatogram
peaks in fingerprint of CA-30 and LWD-b mixture. For
LWB-B, the chromatographic separation was obtained
on a NucleosilNH2 100Å column, there were five
chromatogram peaks and these five peaks represent
fructose, glucose, sucrose, mannotriose and stachyose, the
retention times of them were 6.260 min, 6.829 min, 8.186
min, 18.305 min and 21.506 min, respectively.

Grading score for evaluation of the degree of
senescence
For evaluation of the degree of senescence in
SAMR1 mice, a grading score system developed by
Hosokawa, M., et al. (1984) [39] was adopted. The
indexes in this system contained 11 categories selected
from the clinical signs and gross lesions considered to be
closely associated with the senescence process. In briefly,
the grading score system, including reactivity, passivity,
glossiness, coarseness, hair loss, ulcer, periophthalmic
lesions, cataract, corneal ulcer, corneal opacity and
lordoscoliosis, was designed to assess changes in behavior
and appearance of the mice. The grade 0 represented no
particular changes and grade 4 represented the most severe
changes. Details are given in Supplement Table 1.

Animals and drug administration

Locomotor activity test

Original SAMR1 were kindly provided by Dr.
T. Takeda at Kyoto University, Japan. And ICR-CD1
mice, a healthy and clean strain commonly used as
control mice. The mice were kept in plastic-bottomed
cages (290×180×152 mm) and maintained in the Beijing
Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology under standard
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The procedure of locomotor activity test was
according with Cheng, et al. (2011) [108]. Motor tracking
was performed using a video-based behavior monitoring
system (Jiliang Software Technology Co. Ltd., Shanghai,
26959

Oncotarget

China). Each mouse was placed in an aluminum-plastic
panel locomotor activity chamber (40cm×40cm×40cm,
one animal pretesting cage). The total traveled distance
of each mouse was recorded to indicate its spontaneous
motor activity. The locomotor activity of each mouse was
recorded for 20 min.

antibody (BioLegend),100μL of 25μg/mL APC anti-mouse
CD25 antibody (BioLegend) and 100μL of 20 μg/mL PE
anti- mouse FOXP3 (BioLegend) using the same protocol
as above. The third part of spleen cells were treated with
100μL of 20μg/mL FITC anti-mouse CD19 antibody
(BioLegend) and 100μL of 50μg/mL PE anti-mouse CD80
antibody (BioLegend) using the same protocol as above.
After incubation, the cells were washed and resuspended
in 0.5 mL of PBS/2% paraformaldehyde, then quantified
by flow cytometry (BD Calibur TM).

Morris water maze test
The procedure of Morris water maze test was
according to Charles V Vorhees & Michael T Williams
(2006) [109]. The apparatus of Morris water maze test
consisted of a 90cm in diameter and 45 cm circular pool
with a black inner surfer, placed in a dim light soundproof room. Unique geometric figures were installed
on the curtains. The pool was divided into 4 quadrants
and filled with 30 cm in depth 20±1°C water, a 6 cm in
diameter black platform in the first quadrant. The platform
was 1 cm below the surface of the water. This behavioral
task included hidden-platform training (spatial learning)
and probe trial (spatial memory) session. In the hiddenplatform training session, the mouse was allowed 4 daily
trials in the presence of the platform, for 5 subsequent
days. In this session, mice were devoted into the pool
facing the wall in one of the four quadrants. When the
mouse located the platform, it was allowed to stay on the
platform for 10 s, and if the mouse did not locate within
60 s, it was placed on the platform for 10 s to familiarize.
After each trail, the mouse was taken back to its home
cage and dried by warm towel. The experimental group
sequence was changed every day for experimental data
balance. In the probe trial session, the platform was
removed, and the mouse was allowed to swim to search
it for 60 s. During the whole Morris water maze test, the
escape latency (the time taken to find the hidden platform)
in hidden-platform training session, the escape latency (the
first time that the mice crossed the removed platform),
number of times that the mice crossed the removed
platform and the swimming time within the target quadrant
in probe trial session were recorded and analyzed.

Spleen cells and T, B lymphocytes proliferation
assay
The mouse spleen was minced through a 40μm
nylon cell strainer to acquire single cell suspension. Red
blood cells were depleted by Tris-NH4Cl lysis buffer
(0.017 M Tris-HCl, 0.144 M NH4Cl). According to the
manufacturer`s protocol, splenocytes were seeded in
96-wells plate at 5 × 105 cells per well and stimulated with
or without 0.5μg/mL concanavalin A (Con A) (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO) or5μg/mL lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) (Sigma-Aldrich), respectively. The lymphocytes
were cultured in RPMI-1640 (GibcoBRL, Life
Technologies, USA) medium, and replenished with 10%
FBS (Hyclone Laboratories), streptomycin (100μg/mL)
and penicillin (100 U/mL) at 37℃ in a 5% CO2 humidiﬁed
incubator for 56 h , and supplemented with 1μCi/well3Hthymidine (GEHealthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) for the
last 16 h. The cells were harvested on glass fiber filters
by a Filtermate cell harvester (Packard). The total amount
of 3H-thymidine incorporated in cells was measured by a
β-scintillation counter (BECKMAN LS6500). The results
were expressed as cpm (counters per minute) of stimulated
and unstimulated cells.

Multiplex bead analysis
Plasma samples of the mice were diluted 1:1
in the assay buffer and analyzed by multiplex bead
analysis. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-2 (IL-2),
interleukin-5 (IL-5), interleukin-17 (IL-17), interleukin-6
(IL-6), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-10 (IL-10),
granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GMCSF), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF),
interferon-γ (INF-γ), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α),
monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), regulated
upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted
factor (RANTES), eotaxin, macrophage Inflammatory
Protein-1β (MIP-1β), interleukin-23 (IL-23) and tumor
necrosis factor β (TNF-β) were measured according
to the manufacturer`s instructions (Millipore Corp.,
USA). Briefly, the plasma samples were incubated with
premixed beads overnight at 4℃, washed beads were
further incurred with detection antibody for 1 h at room

Flow cytometric analysis
Mouse spleen cells were harvested and divided into
three parts. The first part of the spleen cells were treated
with 100μL of 20μg/mL FITC anti-mouse CD3 antibody
(BioLegend, San Diego, USA), 100μL of12.5μg/mL Percp
anti-mouse CD4 antibody (BioLegend) and 100μL of
12.5μg/mL APC anti-mouse CD8 antibody (BioLegend)
at 25℃ for 30 min, washed, and followed by incubation
with 100μL of 10μg/mL FITC-conjugated goat anti-rat
IgG (BioLegend) and incubated at 25℃ for 30 min in
the dark. The second part of the spleen cells were treated
with 100μL of 20μg/mL FITC anti-mouse CD3 antibody
(BioLegend), 100μL of 12.5μg/mL Percp anti-mouse CD4

Author’s contributions

PCA is a classical multivariate technique, the aim
is to extract the important information from numerous
(n) possibly correlated variables (M1, M2, …, Mn) and to
represent it as a set of fewer variables, named principal
components. The first PC (PC1) accounts for as much of
the variability in the data as possible, and each succeeding
component (PC2,…, PCk) accounts for as much of the
remaining variability as possible [110]. PC are calculated
from the eigen decomposition of covariance matrix M. The
jth PC is a linear combination of the observed variables
was calculated as follows:
PCj = α1jM1 + ... + αnjMn
Where coefficients αnj are the elements of the
eigenvector corresponding to jth eigenvalue.
In the present study, a data matrix with m
observations on k1, k2and k3 variables (m = 46, the number
of individuals in the entire data set, k1 = 4, cognitive
markers, k2 = 7, neuroendocrine markers, k3 = 16, immune
markers). PCA was carried out on M, scores of the
selected PC were calculated for all individuals. We chose
the PC1 and PC2 to plot, in order to distinguish young and
old SAMR1 mice from chronic inflammation phenotype.
The PCA was processed SAS software (SAS 9.2, SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC), and visualized by GraphPad
Prism®, version 6 (GraphPad software, San Diego, CA).
