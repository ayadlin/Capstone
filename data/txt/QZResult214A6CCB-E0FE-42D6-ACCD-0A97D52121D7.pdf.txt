ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) possesses florid angiogenesis. However, the antiangiogenic agent, Bevacizumab, did not improve overall survival of GBM patients. For
more durable anti-angiogenic treatment, we interrogated resistant mechanisms of
GBM against Bevacizumab. Serial orthotopic transplantation of in vivo Bevacizumabtreated GBM cells provoked complete refractoriness to the anti-angiogenic treatment.
These tumors were also highly enriched with malignant phenotypes such as
invasiveness, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and stem-like features. Through
transcriptome analysis, we identified that Talin1 (TLN1) significantly increased in the
refractory GBMs. Inhibition of TLN1 not only attenuated malignant characteristics
of GBM cells but also reversed the resistance to the Bevacizumab treatment. These
data implicate TLN1 as a novel therapeutic target for GBM to overcome resistance to
anti-angiogenic therapies.

Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal
antibody that selectively binds with VEGF to inhibit
interaction between VEGF and its receptors VEGFRs
[9, 10]. A few phase 2 clinical trials of in patients
with recurrent GBM showed transient but dramatic
responses, leading to Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approval for the treatment of recurrent GBMs.
Recent large-scale clinical trials in patients with newly
diagnosed GBM failed to deliver prolongation of
overall survival and confirmed transient therapeutic
effects of Bevacizumab [11–17].
Resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy appears to
be emerged by adaptive mechanisms. GBM tumors after
anti-angiogenic therapy often revealed enhancement of
more invasive and infiltrative phenotypes and inevitably
relapsed [14, 16, 18]. Understanding the molecular
mechanisms of the anti-angiogenic therapy resistance is

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most
aggressive and infiltrative primary brain tumor. GBM
is a well-vascularized tumor with florid angiogenesis.
Median survival days of the patients diagnosed with GBM
remains less than 15 months despite maximal therapeutic
treatments [1–3]. High degree of endothelial proliferation
is one of criteria for GBM diagnosis. In addition, GBM
cells express large amounts of vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) and other angiogenic molecules that
promote formation of new and permeable vessels [4–8].
These suggest that inhibition of angiogenesis might be an
effective therapeutic strategy against GBM, and indeed
various anti-angiogenic therapeutic strategies have been
tested in GBM.

a critical unmet need to improve the patient outcome.
Here, we describe our systematic interrogation of
Bevacizumab-resistance and identification of the
cytoskeleton protein Talin1 (TLN1) as a key regu­
lator of Bevacizumab-resistance. Furthermore, by
utilizing patient-derived GBM xenografts and serial
transplantation models, we interrogated functional
roles of TLN1 in stem cell features, invasion, and
Bevacizumab-resistance of GBM.

most of AR tumor-bearing mice died within 20 days with
a median survival of 18 days. Next, we determined the
Bevacizumab response in Br3CT and AR tumor models.
Survival benefits were calculated by the extended
survival days by Bevacizumab treatment compared
to the untreated control. Mice implanted with Br3CT
revealed Bevacizumab-mediated survival benefits (2.3
± 0.06 folds increase), almost identical to the parental
U87 tumor-bearing mice. In sharp contrast, AR tumorbearing mice revealed significantly diminished survival
benefit from Bevacizumab treatment (1.6 ± 0.05 folds, p
< 0.01) (Figure 1D). Collectively, these data suggest that
AR tumors grow more aggressively in a Bevacizumabresistant manner.

RESULTS
Establishment of the Bevacizumab-resistant
GBM models
A subset of GBM patients receiving Bevacizumab
initially responded but inevitably succumbed to this
disease often with more invasive and aggressive tumor
growth pattern. To establish the model systems that can
mimic these Bevacizumab-mediated therapeutic responses
in human patients, we have developed in vivo serial
transplantation models of Bevacizumab-treated GBM.
U87MG glioma cell line generates orthotopic xenograft
tumors efficiently and expresses a high level of human
VEGF. Mice with Bevacizumab therapy were survived
significantly longer than the control group (median
survival days, 28 days in control group and 48 days in
Bevacizumab-treated group, p < 0.0001) (Figure 1A).
Immunohistological analysis using endothelial marker
CD34 antibody showed a significantly low vessel density
in Bevacizumab-treated mice (28.3 ± 8.3% compared to the
control, p < 0.05) (data not shown). These findings suggest
that although Bevacizumab do not target mouse VEGF,
tumor-driven human VEGF is a main driver of tumor
angiogenesis in this model. In contrast to well-demarcated
control tumor, many tumor cells from Bevacizumab-treated
mice invaded adjacent brain parenchyma (Figure 1B),
suggesting an acquisition of more invasive tumor growth
pattern by Bevacizumab treatment.
To further characterize these acquired tumor
phenotypes by Bevacizumab, we performed the serial
transplantation experiments. Tumor cells were isolated
from Bevacizumab-treated tumor-bearing mice and
injected into the new recipient mice orthotopically.
These mice were treated with Bevacizumab as well,
and the resultant tumors were re-implanted for other
recipient mice. We obtained the tumors established by
three consecutive in vivo passages with Bevacizumab
and designated as AR (Avastin-Resistant) tumors. As a
control for serial transplantation process, Bevacizumabnaïve U87 cells were serially transplanted in vivo
without Bevacizumab treatment (Br3CT). We first
determined the tumor latency by survival analysis of
tumor-bearing mice. The median survival of Br3CT
orthotopic xenograft mice was 27 days, similar to the
parental U87 tumor-bearing mice (Figure 1C). Notably,

Bevacizumab-resistant tumors are enriched with
tumor initiation capacity and invasiveness
As AR tumors grow more aggressive and faster
than the controls, we determined whether these tumors
contain higher tumor initiation capacity. In vivo limiting
dilution tumor formation assay is the most, if not the only,
robust functional assay for determining GBM initiation
capacity in vivo. While Br3CT cells required at least
10000 cells for tumor formation, 1000 cells of AR cells
were sufficient to generate orthotopic tumors (Figure 1E).
A half of mice injected with only 100 AR cells developed
tumors, in contrast to no tumor with Br3CT cells,
suggesting that AR tumors are enriched with tumor
initiating cells. As the enrichment of stem cell associated
markers such as CD133 and SOX2 correlated with tumor
initiation capacity, we then determined the expression
of these genes. AR tumors express significantly high
expression of CD133 and SOX2 than Br3CT control
tumors [CD133, 9.2 ± 0.84 fold (p < 0.001); SOX2, 6.15
± 1.8 fold (p < 0.01)] (Figure 1F). Next, we determined
invasive growth pattern in AR tumor. Histological analysis
showed that AR tumors harbored a highly infiltrative
and invasive growth pattern in vivo, consistent with
Bevacizumab-treated U87 parental tumors (Figure 1G).
To further determine invasive characteristic of AR
cells, we isolated tumor cells and processed for in vitro
matrigel invasion assays. Compared to the BR3CT cells,
AR cells harbor more than 3 folds of invasive cells (p
< 0.05), suggesting that AR tumors are highly enriched
with invasive capacity (Figure 1H). As acquisition of
mesenchymal properties through EMT-like process is
implicated in GBM cell motility and invasiveness, we
determined the levels of the representative EMT markers
in AR tumors. Expression levels of the representative
mesenchymal markers, vimentin and ZEB1, are increased,
while expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin
was decreased in AR tumors compared to Br3CT tumor
(Figure 1F). Taken together, these data strongly suggest
that AR tumors are highly enriched with tumor initiation
capacity and invasive growth pattern.

TLN1 was highly expressed in Bevacizumabtreated GBM

As TLN1 loss impeded stem-like clonogenic growth
and invasive capacities of GBM cells, we then determined
the mRNA levels of stem cell associated factors and
regulators of invasion and mesenchymal properties.
Notably, expression levels of stem cell associated
factors including CD133, cMyc, Nanog, and Oct4 were
significantly decreased by TLN1 K/D (Figure 3E). While
E-cadherin mRNA expression was increased (Figure 3G),
the levels of mesenchymal regulators such as vimentin,
snail and ZEB1, and MMP2 were significantly decreased
in TLN1 K/D cells compared to the control (Figure 3F).
These trends were confirmed by the immunoblot analyses
(Figure 3H). These data support a key role of TLN1 in
regulation of stem-like properties and invasiveness in
GBM.

To get molecular insights for Bevacizumabresistance in GBM, we conducted mRNA microarray
experiments using U87MG orthotopic xenograft tumors
with or without Bevacizumab treatment (n = 3 for each
group) (Supplementary Table S1 and S2). Pathway
analysis using Biocarta database revealed that ATM
signaling, cell cycle, neuronal development and Rho
cell motility pathways were significantly upregulated in
Bevacizumab-treated group compared to the untreated
group (Figure 2A). As the acquisition of more invasive
phenotype is a key characteristic of Bevacizmab-resistant
GBM, we chose to further investigate the role of the
cytoskeleton protein Talin1 (TLN1) that was implicated
in cell motility signaling pathways. TLN1 mRNA in
Bevacizumab-treated group was about 3 fold higher than
that in control. Immunoblot analysis showed that levels
of TLN1 protein in Bevacizumab-treated tumors were > 7
fold higher than those in the control group. (Figure 2B).
Immunohistochemical analysis also showed that TLN1
was significantly increased in Bevacizumab-treated
xenograft tumors (Figure 2C).
In addition, TLN1 was significantly overexpressed
in glioma specimens, and its expression correlated
with poor survival of glioma patients, determined by
Rembrandt databases (Figure 2D).

Loss of TLN1 attenuated resistance to
Bevacizumab treatment
Having shown the role of TLN1 in GBM cells in
vitro, we attempted to address the role of in vivo tumor
propagation and, more importantly, in vivo Bevacizumabresistance. U87 cells either expressing the non-target
(NT) shRNA or TLN1 shRNA were injected into mouse
brains. Without Bevacizumab, mice with TLN1 K/D
tumor survived significantly longer than control group
(median survival days; Control, 33 days; shTLN1,
51 days, p < 0.001). Notably, mice with TLN1 K/D
tumor and Bevacizumab survived more than 3 months
(median survival days; Bev, 51 days; shTLN1+Bev, 92
days, p < 0.001) (Figure 3I). Importantly, histological
analysis also revealed that TLN1 K/D tumors do not
have protruding invasive cells at the margin despite
Bevacizumab treatment, suggesting that TLN1 K/D
negates Bevacizumab-induce invasive tumor growth
pattern (Figure 3J).

Loss of TLN1 diminished clonogenic growth, cell
motility, and expression of mesenchymal and
stem cell associated markers in GBM cells
To determine the functional roles of TLN1 in GBM,
we employed shRNA-mediated TLN1 K/D approach.
We overexpressed TLN1 shRNA in U87 cells and we
determined the role of TLN1 in clonogenic growth by
performing in vitro limiting dilution assays. Notably,
TLN1 K/D cells were inefficient in generating clones
compared to the control (Figure 3A). Then, we determined
the effect of TLN1 in glioma migration/invasion.
Results showed that invasive capacity of U87MG was
inhibited approximately 90% by TLN1 K/D (Figure 3B).
Collectively, these data showed that TLN1 K/D diminished
the clonogenic growth and invasiveness of GBM.
TLN1 was previously implicated in cell migration,
mainly through focal adhesion kinase pathway. To
determine the alteration of downstream effectors, we
performed immunoblots using antibodies against FAK,
Akt, and Erk. TLN1 K/D significantly decreased the
levels of the phosphorylated of FAK (Y397), and to lesser
degree, phosphorylated Akt (S473) and Erk (Figure 3C).
In addition, the morphology of TLN1 K/D cells became
round and polygonal compared to the parental cells,
raising the possibility that TLN1 stimulates mesenchymal
properties of GBM cells (Figure 3D).

Inhibition of TLN1 attenuated epithelial
mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cell
properties in AR cells
As the above data suggest the involvement of TLN1
in stem-like characteristics, invasion, and Bevacizumabmediated invasive growth of GBM, we investigated
the role of TLN1 in Bevacizumab-resistant AR tumors.
Consistent with our hypothesis, TLN1 expression was
significantly high in AR tumors compared to Br3CT
tumors (Figure 4A). Using TLN1 K/D approach, we
interrogated the effects of TLN1 in clonogenic growth,
stem cell marker genes, and invasion. Similar to the
case of TLN1 K/D in parental U87, Inhibition of TLN1
significantly attenuated all of the above (Figure 4B–4F).
Furthermore, TLN1 K/D significantly delayed growth
of highly aggressive AR tumor (median survival,
NT shRNA-AR, 21 days and shTLN1-AR, 28 days,
p < 0.001) (Figure 4G). Taken together, these results

strongly implicate that TLN1 positively stimulate stemlike properties and invasion, and inhibition of TLN1 can
diminish Bevacizumab-mediated aggressiveness in GBM.

models, two patient-derived orthotopic tumor models
were established and performed in vivo Bevacizumab
treatment. Similar to AR tumors, TLN1 K/D in both 827
and 448 cells significantly diminished the frequencies of
spheres in 3D matrigel limiting dilution assays, raising
the possibility that TLN1 function might be associated
with extracellular matrix (Figure 5A). Invasion capacities
of both cells were significantly decreased by TLN1 K/D
(Figure 5B). Immunoblots and RT-PCR analysis showed
that TLN1 K/D greatly decreased the expression levels of
the stem cell associated factors and EMT markers, further
establishing the role of TLN1 in GBM self-renewal and
invasion (Figure 5C–5E).

Functional validation of TLN1 in the patientderived primary GBM cells with Bevacizumab
therapy
Recently, we have shown that xenograft tumors
derived from primary GBM specimens recapitulate the
patient-specific responses to therapies such as radiation,
temozolomide and Bevacizumab treatment [19]. To
validate the role of TLN1 in these clinically relevant GBM

The above data collectively suggest that TLN1
positively activates the process of stem cell renewal
and invasion, characteristics that are associated with
Bevacizumab-resistance. We hypothesized that TLN1
targeting would potentiate Bevacizumab-mediated antitumor effects in patient-derived GBM tumors. Tumor
cells with either NT shRNA or TLN1 shRNA were
transplanted for orthotopic tumors, and tumor-bearing
mice were treated with Bevacizumab. A striking survival
benefit was observed in both models. Inhibition of TLN1
in 827 tumors prolonged the survival, and greater survival
gain was achieved by combination treatment [median
survival days; Control, 35 days, Bev, 40 days (p < 0.01
vs. Control), shTLN1, 40 days (p < 0.001 vs. Control)
and shTLN1 plus Bev, 45 days (p < 0.001 vs. Control)
(p < 0.001 vs. Bev) (p < 0.001 vs. shTLN1)]. Inhibition
of TLN1 in 448T tumors couldn’t make tumors for more
than 5 months (median survival days; Control, 45 days and
Bev, 45 days). These data showed TLN1 targeting strongly
inhibited tumor formation and potentiated the effects of
anti-angiogenic therapy in patient-derived xenograft
models (Figure 5F and 5G).

mice. However, survival benefit by Bevacizumab was
significantly decreased by in vivo serial transplantations
of Bevacizumab-treated tumors. Indeed, the development
of Bevacizumab-resistance over time may represent
the therapeutic responses seen in some patients with
Bevacizumab. Notably, Bevacizumab-resistant AR tumors
obtained by three consecutive in vivo passages were highly
enriched with stem cell features, mesenchymal properties,
and invasiveness. Further investigation is required to
determine whether enriched stem-like phenotypes in AR
tumor is due to clonal selection or enrichment of stem-like
populations. It remains incompletely understood how antiangiogenic therapy affects tumor hierarchy. AR tumors
will be therefore an excellent model system to identify
molecular mechanisms of evasive resistance and test the
efficacies of the combinatory therapeutic approaches that
might substantiate anti-angiogenic therapy.
Using these U87-derived Bevacizumab-resistant
tumor and the patient-derived primary GBM models,
we identified that TLN1 was significantly upregulated
by Bevacizumab treatment. TLN1 loss inhibited
the expression of stem cell-associated proteins and
mesenchymal proteins, and impeded invasion and
in vivo tumor growth. More importantly, Inhibition of
TLN1 significantly potentiated the therapeutic effect of
Bevacizumab.
Anti-angiogenic effects on cancer stemness
and invasiveness are possibly related to the hypoxia
generated in the tumor microenvironment [25]. The
transcription factor prediction databases such as Match
Program (www.gene-regulation.com) and JASPAR
database (http://jaspar.genereg.net) revealed that hypoxia
inducible factor 1β (HIF1β) is a potential transcriptional
factor of TLN1 (data not shown). Therefore, in the
hypoxic condition, HIF1β might stimulate TLN1
mediating-intracellular signaling pathways combining
with HIF1α. Because anti-angiogenic therapies induce
not only hypoxia but also metabolic stress, low nutrient
condition could be also one of the possible regulating
mechanisms of TLN1 in the GBM.
TLN1 is known as a molecule involved in
maintaining cytoskeleton and integrin signaling [26].
Recent studies have demonstrated that the interaction
between TLN1 and integrin is an early event in
membrane–cytoskeleton cross-linking and that Inhibition
of TLN1 could prevent integrin activation, suggesting a
role of TLN1 as an upstream regulator of integrin pathway
[27–30]. As TLN1 was reported to regulate the cell–cell
adhesion protein E-cadherin in an integrin-independent
manner, TLN1 appears to regulate multiple downstream
effectors [30]. Recently, Integrin β1 was implicated
to mediate Bevacizumab-resistance in GBM [26]. It is
possible that TLN1 and integrin β1 in GBM are involved
in the same signaling axis. In line with this, reciprocal
communication between extracellular matrix and tumor
cells is recognized as a major tumor microenvironment

DISCUSSION
Bevacizumab-mediated anti-angiogenic therapies
have met with limited success in the recent large clinical
trials. Accumulating evidence suggests that tumor
adaptations in VFGF-independent microenvironment,
which often includemore aggressive and mesenchymalliketransitions, are major reasons for transient therapeutic
benefit by Bevacizumab [14, 20–24]. Understanding
of such resistance mechanisms and identification of
molecular targets will lead to the development of more
efficacious and sustainable therapeutic strategies. By
developing in vivo Bevacizumab- resistant tumor models
and utilizing a series of patient-derived GBM models, we
have identified and validated TLN1 as a key mediator of
Bevacizumab-resistance in GBM.
The development of the optimal model systems that
mimic the responses of the VEGF-neutralizing antibody
Bevacizumab remains a critical, unresolved issue.
Xenograft models derived from human glioma cell lines
and patient-derived primary GBM models can inform the
biology of human GBM, however, VEGF neutralization
is likely incomplete because Bevacizumab can block only
human-derived VEGF but not the murine VEGF. While
various mouse glioma models and the use of anti-murine
VEGF antibody can circumvent this issue, it is unclear
whether murine GBM models can fully recapitulate
the biology of human GBM. By a serial transplantation
approach, we have developed the tumor models that are
enriched with Bevacizumab-resistant tumor phenotypes.
Consistent with a high level of tumor-derived VEGF in
U87, Bevacizumab treatment on the naïve-U87 tumors
significantly prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing

and TLN1 are known to be a key regulator in this
process. Alternatively, TLN1 in GBM may contribute to
invasion of cancer cells via survival signaling pathways
by activating ECM-integrin–mediated signaling and
promoting anoikis resistance [31]. Further study needs to
demonstrate theregulating mechanismsof TLN1 regarding
Bevacizumab-resistance.
Although exact pathway to which TLN1 is driving
stem-like invasive tumor phenotypes and Bevacizumabresistance is yet to be determined, potent effects of TLN1
targeting on GBM cell growth and Bevacizumab-resistance
strongly supports TLN1 as a potential therapeutic target.
In conclusion, we demonstrate that TLN1 is a
critical regulator of stem-like features, invasion, and
Bevacizumab-resistance in GBM. Furthermore, TLN1 is
a potential anti-GBM target alone or in combination with
anti-angiogenic therapy.

U87MG cell line was obtained from and authenticated by
American Type Culture Collection. Cells were maintained
in Minimum Essential Media (MEM) (11095, Gibco)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (12483030, Gibco) and antibiotics, penicillin/streptomycin
(15140-122, Gibco).

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
Total RNA extraction was performed using RNeasy
Plus Mini kit (74134, Quiazen) and RNA concentration
was measured by Nano Drop 2000 (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). cDNA was sunsequently synthesized using
SuperScriptTM III First Strand Synthesis System (18080–
051, Invitrogen) for quantitative real-time RT-PCR.
Diluted cDNA and gene-specific primers (Table 1) were
mixed with 5X HOT FIREPol® EvaGreen ® qPCR Mix
Plus (ROX) (Solis Biodyne) according to the supplied
protocol. Amplification was performed in the following
temperature-time profile: 95°C −10 minutes, then 40
cycles; 95°C −15 seconds and 60°C −1 minute. The levels
of expression for the selected genes were normalized by
expression of beta-actin.

GBM orthotopic xenograft models

Western blotting

The animal experiments were approved by the
Review Board of Samsung Biomedical Research Institute
(Seoul, Korea). For establishment of human GBM
orthotopic xenograft, six-week old female BALB/c nude
mice (Orient Bio) were used. GBM cells in 5 μl Hank’s
Balanced Salt Solution (GIBCO) were directly implanted
into the brains of anesthetized mice using rodent
stereotactic frame [co-ordinates: anterior/posterior +1.0
mm, medial/lateral +1.7 mm, dorsal/ventral −3.2 mm].
Bevacizumab (10 mg/kg, twice a week, intraperitoneal
injection) treatment was started at 1 week after tumor

In vivo limiting tumor formation assay

Two-dimensional (2D) invasion assay

For validation of in vivo tumor forming ability of
GBM cells, orthotopic xenograft models were established
by injection of different numbers of tumor cells like as
100, 1000 and 10000 cells orthotopically. All mice were
sacrificed, simultaneously. For evaluate morphology
of tumor, the brain slices were fixed in 10% formalin/
PBS, embedded in paraffin, sectioned into 4 μm coronal
sections, and stained with H&E.

Matrigel invasion assays were performed at 37°C
for 24 or 48 hours using transwell membrane coated with
matrigel (354483, BD Bioscience). NT or TLN1 K/D of
U87MG cell, AR cell and patient derived GBM cells, 827
and 448T, were seeded onto the upper wells of precoated
transwells, 1 × 104 cells per well. Lower wells of the
transwells contained the same medium with 1% FBS. After
24 or 48 hours of incubation, the cells on the upper well and
the membranes coated with Matrigel were swabbed with a
Q-tip, fixed with methanol, and stained with hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E). The cells that penetrated through filter were
counted at a magnification of ×200 in 10 randomly selected
fields, and the mean number of cells per field was recorded.

In vitro limiting dilution assay
Limiting dilution assay was performed in 96
well plates. Briefly, GBM cells were seeded (1 to 500
cells/well) in 8 wells at each cell numbers. After 2
or 3 weeks, wells without spheres were counted and
analyzed.

Histological analysis
Immunohistochemical analysis was performed as
described [33] and conducted using antibodies against
TLN1 (ab71333, Abcam) and CD34 (ab8158, Abcam).

Three-dimensional (3D) sphere forming assay in
matrigel
The TLN1 knockdown (K/D) GBM cells (5 ×
102 cells of each cells) were mixed with matrigel (BD
Bioscience) and poured into the 4 well plates. After 2 or 3
weeks, spheroid were counted and compared with NT of
each cells.
