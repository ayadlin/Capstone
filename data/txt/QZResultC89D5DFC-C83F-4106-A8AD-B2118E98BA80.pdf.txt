outcomes, MYCN-amplified (MNA) tumors that have poor prognosis (2), and tumors characterized by hemizygous loss of
chromosome 11q material, which are associated with poor survival
(3, 4). Each of these genetic subtypes is also characterized by
significantly different global gene expression profiles (5, 6).
Additional chromosomal imbalances occur in each major unfavorable genetic subtype, some of which are nonrandomly distributed.
For example, loss of distal chromosome 1p occurs preferentially in
MNA tumors, whereas loss of chromosome 3p occurs primarily
in the 11q subtype (7–9). The most common chromosomal
imbalance, gain of 17q, occurs at high frequency in all subtypes of
advanced-stage neuroblastomas and has been associated with a
poor clinical outcome in most studies (10–12). There are also many
additional recurring large-scale chromosome imbalances that
occur in neuroblastoma, which are not associated with prognosis
but may nevertheless contribute to the disease.
The identification of genes that have been directly affected by
chromosomal imbalances is complicated because large numbers
of genes map to the regions of imbalance. The possibility that
some tumor suppressor genes convey a tumorigenic effect
through haploinsufficiency may be responsible for further
complicating their identification. It is also possible that the
dysregulation of multiple genes in the regions of imbalance is
contributing to neuroblastoma pathogenesis (6). Intriguingly, it is
also possible that some of the sequences with oncogenic effects in
neuroblastoma are not conventional protein-coding gene sequences but rather nontranslated RNA sequences that have important
regulatory functions. Many nontranslated RNA sequences, such as
microRNAs (miRNA), map to the regions of genomic imbalance
described above and may contribute to neuroblastoma pathogenesis.
miRNAs regulate gene expression at a posttranscriptional level
by either inhibiting mRNAs from being translated or causing them
to be degraded. They play major roles in the differentiation of
neural (13) and other cell types, and the dysregulation of these
sequences can have tumor suppressor or oncogenic activity in
different forms of cancer. For example, two miRNAs (miR-15 and
miR-16) mapping to chromosomal region 13q14 are frequently
deleted and down-regulated in chronic lymphocytic leukemias and
thus act as tumor suppressor genes (14). miRNAs acting in a
dominant oncogenic manner are illustrated by another cluster of
miRNAs (mir-17-92) on chromosome 13, which are coamplified
and overexpressed in some lymphomas (15, 16). Some miRNAs,
such as miR-21 on chromosome 17q, can have antiapoptotic effects
in cancer cells (17, 18). Overall, the importance of miRNAs in
cancer is illustrated by the fact that the expression profiles of a
small set of miRNAs could classify multiple cancers more
accurately than data from f16,000 mRNAs (19). The finding that
miRNAs are frequently located at fragile sites and genomic regions
involved in cancers further implicates their involvement with
malignant diseases (20).

Abstract
Neuroblastoma accounts for 15% of pediatric cancer deaths,
and although a few protein-coding genes, such as MYCN, are
involved with aggressive pathogenicity, the identification of
novel biological targets for therapeutic intervention is still a
necessary prerequisite for improving patient survival. Expression profiling of 157 microRNA (miRNA) loci in 35 primary
neuroblastoma tumors indicates that 32 loci are differentially
expressed in favorable and unfavorable tumor subtypes,
indicating a potential role of miRNAs in neuroblastoma
pathogenesis. Many of these loci are significantly underexpressed in tumors with MYCN amplification, which have
particularly poor prognoses. Interestingly, we found that
miRNA expression levels substantially change in a MYCNamplified cell line following exposure to retinoic acid, a
compound which is well known for causing reductions in
MYCN expression and for inducing neuroblastoma cell lines to
undergo neuronal differentiation. We also show that small
interfering RNA inhibition of MYCN by itself causes similar
alterations in the expression of miRNA loci. In vitro functional
studies of one locus, miR-184, indicate that it plays a
significant role in apoptosis. The association of experimentally induced alterations of miRNA expression in neuroblastoma cell lines with differentiation or apoptosis leads us to
conclude that these loci play important roles in neuroblastoma pathogenesis. We further suggest that MYCN may mediate
a tumorigenic effect, in part, through directly or indirectly
regulating the expression of miRNAs that are involved with
neural cell differentiation and/or apoptosis, warranting
substantial further studies of miRNAs as potential therapeutic
targets. [Cancer Res 2007;67(3):976–83]

Introduction
Neuroblastoma, one of the most common solid tumors in
children, is derived from primitive cells of the sympathetic nervous
system and is responsible for f15% of all childhood cancer deaths
(see ref. 1 for review). These tumors are particularly noted for
extensive heterogeneity in clinical behavior, ranging from spontaneous regression to aggressive clinical course and death due to
disease. This clinical heterogeneity is correlated, to some extent,
with genetic abnormalities found in the tumors. At least three
major genetic subtypes of the disease exist, including hyperdiploid/
near triploid tumors that generally are associated with favorable

MicroRNA Expression in Neuroblastoma

Elucidating the role of miRNAs in cancer is clearly in its infancy,
and to the best of our knowledge, there is presently only one
published study on the role of miRNA dysregulation in pediatric
cancer (21). It seems quite logical that miRNAs will be particularly
important in pediatric cancer given their role in normal
developmental processes and the fact that pediatric malignancies
tend to involve perturbation of such pathways. Here, we have
examined the differential expression of 157 miRNA loci, representing approximately one third of all known human miRNAs in three
major genetic subtypes of neuroblastoma. We determine how
miRNA expression profiles change following retinoic acid–induced
differentiation of neuroblastoma cell lines, a compound used in the
treatment of this cancer, which leads to reduced MYCN expression
(22). Most significantly, we show that small interfering RNA (siRNA)
inhibition of MYCN also alters the expression profiles of many
miRNA loci. Transfection of one such locus, miR-184, into
neuroblastoma cells was found to cause massive apoptosis and
G1 arrest. These results suggest that miRNAs play important roles
in neuroblastoma pathogenesis.

Materials and Methods
Neuroblastoma tissue and cell lines. Primary neuroblastoma tumors
were obtained from two sources: the Children’s Oncology Group Tumor
Bank (Philadelphia, PA) and a tumor bank at Our Lady’s Hospital for Sick
Children (Dublin, Ireland). The genetic abnormalities of the tumors were
identified previously by metaphase comparative genomic hybridization
(CGH), oligonucleotide array CGH, fluorescence in situ hybridization, or
other techniques (5, 7, 23, 24). Histology from each specimen was reviewed
and tumors were graded according to the International Neuroblastoma
Pathology Classification system (Table 1). These tumors were selected to be
representative of three genetic-clinical subsets (hyperdiploid, MNA, or
11q ) and therefore may not be broadly representative of unselected
patients. The hyperdiploid tumors had a DNA index ranging from 1.25 to
1.54 and are characterized by whole chromosome gains and losses with few,
if any, structural chromosome abnormalities. In particular, these tumors
completely lack MNA, loss of 1p, 3p, and 11q, and gain of 17q material. All
tumors were obtained at diagnosis before chemotherapy. The SK-N-AS and
Kelly (N206) cell lines were obtained from the European Collection of
Animal Cell Cultures (Porton Down, United Kingdom), whereas SK-N-BE
was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).
Stem-loop reverse transcription and Taqman real-time PCR. Total
RNA was isolated with Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the
instructions of the manufacturer. Stem-loop reverse transcription for
mature miRNA was done as described previously (25). All reagents were
obtained from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). The Early Access kit,
containing assays for 157 of the 474 miRNAs listed in the Sanger miRBase
database, was used. Briefly, 5 ng of total RNA were reverse transcribed to
cDNA with stem-loop primers and the Taqman MicroRNA Reverse
Transcription kit. Quantitative real-time PCR was done by using an Applied
Biosystems 7500 Real-time PCR System and a Taqman Universal PCR
Master Mix. All PCR primers were from the Taqman MicroRNA Assays. Two
different sequences, RNU19 and RNU66 [both are small RNAs encoded
in the introns of MATR3 (chr5:138642507-138642567) and RPL5
(chr1:93,018,360-93,018,429; 1p22.1), respectively], were used for normalization. The comparative threshold cycle method was used to calculate the
relative gene expression. PCR products were also analyzed on 3% agarose
gels. MYCN expression was assessed by SYBR Green-based real-time PCR.
All-trans-retinoic acid treatment of neuroblastoma cells. The SK-NBE cell line was selected for treatment with 5 Amol/L all-trans-retinoic acid
(ATRA) because this cell line has previously been shown to be responsive to
treatment (26). NB cells were seeded at 5  105 per 100-mm dish 24 h before
treatment. ATRA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was continuously administered by
replacing the medium every 24 h for 5 days. Cell morphology was monitored
with a phase-contrast light microscope.

Transfection of miR precursor molecules and MYCN siRNAs. miR
precursor molecules (miR-184 and miR-30e) and negative control 1
precursor miRNAs were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). MYCN
siRNA was purchased from Invitrogen (three different Stealth siRNA
duplex oligoribonucleotides against MYCN). They were transfected into NB
cells at final concentration of 10 nmol/L using LipofectAMINE RNAiMAX
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Cells were
harvested 24 h after transfection, and miR-184, miR-30e, and MYCN
expression was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) as
described above.
Cell viability assay. A colorimetric assay based on the cleavage of the
tetrazolium salt WST-8 by mitochondrial dehydrogenase in viable cells to a
formazan dye was used following the manufacturer’s instructions (Dojindo
Molecular Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD). Briefly, NB cells were plated at
3  103 per well in 96-well plates with triplicate wells for each transfection.
After the incubation period, 10 AL of cell counting reagent (WST-8) were
added to each well, and incubation was continued for 2 h. Cell viability was

assessed by measuring the absorbance at 450 nm using a microtiter plate
(ELISA) reader.
Apoptosis assays. The activation of executioner caspase-3 and caspase-7
in NB cells was determined using Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay kit according to
the manufacturer’s instructions from Promega (Madison, WI). NB cells were
plated in triplicate in 96-well plates and transfected as described above.
Samples were read after 1 h of incubation with the caspase substrate on a
SpectraMax Gemini M5 Microplate luminometer (Molecular Devices,
Sunnyvale, CA). For cell cycle analysis, cells were stained with propidium
iodide using a Cycletest Plus DNA Reagent kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose,
CA) and analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The
results were analyzed using ModFit LT software (BD Biosciences).
Statistical analysis. Kruskal-Wallis test (nonparametric ANOVA) with
Student’s t testing for comparison of two groups was used to analyze
miRNA expression levels between the different genetic subgroups. A P value
of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. A correction for multiple
comparisons was also carried out using the Tukey-Kramer method.
Statistical significance for caspase-3/caspase-7 activity was assessed using
a Student’s paired t test. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was done
using the centered correlation method in the program Cluster (27). Results
were visualized with the Tree View program (27).

Interestingly, miRNAs in MNA tumors were predominantly downregulated (n = 20) as opposed to being up-regulated (n = 3; Fig. 1A;
Table 2).
To characterize the molecular phenotype of human neuroblastoma, unsupervised two-way agglomerative hierarchical clustering
analysis was done using the differentially expressed miRNAs across
the entire sample set. We found no difference between analyzing
results using either RNU19 or RNU66 for normalization (data not
shown) and only consider the RNU66 data here. There were three
main sample classes discovered in this analysis (Fig. 1A). One of the
classes was composed exclusively of cases with genomic amplification of MYCN. The other two classes were heterogeneous with
hyperdiploid and 11q tumors, although clusters of 11q or
hyperdiploid tumors were observed. Interestingly, the same
clustering patterns were observed based on mRNA expression
profiling (5, 6).
Alteration of miRNA expression following retinoic acid–
induced neuroblastoma cell differentiation. ATRA is known to
arrest growth and induce differentiation in some NB cell lines.
Hence, we evaluated the expression of these miRNAs in a MNA
NB cell line (SK-N-BE) exposed to 5 Amol/L ATRA. ATRA
treatment caused a marked morphologic differentiation characterized by the extension of neurites exceeding at least twice the
length of the cell soma clearly detectable after 5 days (Fig. 2).
Real-time PCR results revealed that 21 of 34 (61.8%) human
miRNAs examined were altered >1.5-fold in SK-N-BE cells
compared with the untreated control (Fig. 1B). The majority
(n = 17) of these miRNAs were up-regulated in the ATRA-treated
cells, whereas a small number (n = 4) were down-regulated. miR184 showed the most dramatic alteration in expression, being upregulated 9-fold after ATRA treatment. Two of the down-regulated
loci, miR-181b and miR-92, were up-regulated in MNA tumors
relative to the other tumor subtypes. Thirteen loci showed no
significant change in expression.
SK-N-BE cells treated with ATRA for 5 days and then released
from ATRA for 3 days had even higher levels of miR-184 (25),
indicating that the effects of ATRA treatment on miRNA expression
continue for at least a short period after release.
Effects of siRNA inhibition of MYCN on miRNA expression in
Kelly cells. Because MYCN is down-regulated in neuroblastoma
cell lines exposed to retinoic acid (22), we have determined the
effect of MYCN down-regulation on miRNA expression using siRNA
inhibition of MYCN. Kelly cells (a MNA NB cell line also known as
N206) were transfected with three different siRNAs (individually or
in pools) targeting MYCN, and the level of silencing was quantified
by real-time PCR. One siRNA, which showed maximal silencing
effects, was selected for further experimental use. Quantitative realtime PCR analysis indicated at least a 60% reduction in MYCN
mRNA levels relative to normal control cells transfected with a
scrambled oligonucleotide (Fig. 3). Expression profiling of siRNAtransfected and normal control cells using a Taqman real-time
PCR-based approach showed significant alterations in the expression of several miRNA loci (Fig. 1B). In most instances, the
direction of expressional change was similar to that which was
observed for ATRA. The two exceptions were miR-181b and
miR-92, which decreased in ATRA-exposed cells and increased in
the siRNA-transfected cells. Overall, however, this siRNA result
was similar to the result obtained by ATRA, which also causes a
reduction in MYCN expression, and suggests that MYCN either
directly or indirectly regulates the expression of several miRNA loci
that seem to be involved with NB cell differentiation. Inspection of

Results
Altered miRNA expression in different genetic subtypes of
neuroblastoma tumors. miRNA expression was analyzed in
primary neuroblastoma tumors by a stem-loop real-time PCRbased miRNA expression profiling method using the Taqman
MicroRNA Assays Human Panel Early Access kit from Applied
Biosystems, which includes 157 identified human miRNAs. Initially,
we compared miRNA expression in a highly characterized set of 18
neuroblastoma, comprising low-stage hyperdiploid tumors with
favorable histopathology (n = 6), high-stage 11q tumors with
unfavorable histopathology (n = 6), and high-stage MNA tumors
with unfavorable histopathology (n = 6). For more accurate and
reliable results, two internal control small RNAs, RNU19 and
RNU66, were used to normalize the miRNA expression data. Very
similar results were obtained using either RNU19 or RNU66 for
normalization.
Thirty-seven of the 157 (f23.6%) miRNAs showed differential
expression between the three categories of tumors, with P values
derived from the nonparametric Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis test
being <0.05. To further validate our results, the 37 differentially
expressed miRNAs were analyzed in another set of 17 neuroblastomas, comprising 5 hyperdiploid tumors, 6 11q tumors, and
6 MNA tumors (Table 1). The expression of the miRNAs identified
in the primary neuroblastoma tumor set was almost fully
confirmed in this new set of samples. Data analysis of the
combined 35 tumor samples indicated that 32 of the 37 miRNAs
were significantly differentially expressed between the three
categories of tumors using both RNU19 and RNU66 for normalization following correction for multiple testing using the TukeyKramer method (Fig. 1A; Table 2).
The binary comparisons of hyperdiploid low-stage tumors with
favorable histology versus the 11q or MYCN high-stage tumors
with unfavorable histology showed differential expression of 6 and
23 miRNA sets, respectively (Table 2). The binary comparisons of
MNA versus 11q high-stage tumors with unfavorable histology
showed differential expression of 12 miRNAs (Table 2). The
difference in expression in these comparisons ranged from 1.6fold to 12.3-fold, with 50% of expressional differences being >3-fold
and 45% being >2-fold. Only three miRNAs are down-regulated in
both MNA and 11q tumors relative to the favorable tumors.

of miR-184 was confirmed by RT-PCR (Fig. 4A). Cell viability of

directly or indirectly regulates several miRNA genes, several of
which have MYCN ebox-binding sites in close proximity (e.g., miR184, miR-92, miR-129, and miR-187). In this regard, we note that
another member of this gene family, MYC, has been shown to
directly regulate a miRNA that regulates the E2F1 transcription
factor (31).
The MYCN mRNA is a putative target of several of the miRNAs
that are down-regulated in MNA tumors, including miR-107,
miR-200c, and miR-302a, as determined by the TargetScan1 and
PicTar2 target prediction algorithms. Although the targeting of
the MYCN 3¶-untranslated region by these miRNAs remains to be
experimentally validated, if true, this explains why it is important
for these miRNAs to be silenced in MNA tumors (i.e., expression of
miRNAs that target MYCN would negate the effects of MYCN
amplification).
For some neuroblastoma cell lines, exposure to ATRA causes
apoptosis rather than the induction of differentiation. Although the
factors that regulate whether a particular cell line will undergo
differentiation versus apoptosis in response to ATRA are not
completely defined, Niizuma et al. (32) recently reported that cell
lines with lower levels of BCL2 expression undergo apoptosis in
response to ATRA, whereas those with higher levels of BCL2 will
differentiate. Our studies indicate that levels of miRNA expression
also likely play a role in neuroblastoma cell apoptosis, given that
overexpression of miR-184 causes both Kelly (MYCN amplified) and
SK-N-AS (MYCN single copy) cell lines to undergo a caspasemediated apoptosis. It is interesting to note that miR-184 has a
more dramatic effect on Kelly cells, which have lower levels of
endogenous miR-184 expression, similar to MNA tumors, than it
does on SK-N-AS. Whether the overexpression or underexpression
of a particular miRNA locus can also induce differentiation of
neuroblastoma cell lines remains to be determined. In any event, a
thorough understanding of the effects of retinoic acids on
neuroblastoma cells is clearly important because 13-cis-retinoic
acid improves patient survival when administered after intensive
chemotherapy.
Many of the miRNAs (let-7a, miR-29b, miR-92, miR-107, miR146, miR-128b, miR-181a, and miR-181b) that are differentially
expressed in neuroblastoma subtypes have been noted to be
involved in other forms of cancer (33–35) or with the control of
cell proliferation (miR-187, miR-216, miR-301, and miR-150;
ref. 36). The fact that f38% of the miRNAs exhibiting differential
expression in neuroblastoma subtypes are differentially expressed
in other forms of cancer or have been shown to regulate cell
proliferation is consistent with the concept that miRNA
dysregulation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of
these tumors. However, the effects of miRNAs could differ greatly
in different cell types given that miRNAs mediate their effects
through targeting mRNAs that are differentially expressed in
tumors. The biological effects of miRNAs are further complicated
by the fact that multiple mRNAs are usually targeted by a single
miRNA.
The usefulness of miRNA expression profiling for classification
of neuroblastoma tumor subtypes is also shown in this report. The
profound down-regulation of many miRNAs in MNA tumors was
the reason why such tumors formed a tight group following
hierarchical cluster analysis. Overexpression of two miRNAs,

To determine the possible mechanism of antiproliferative
activity of miR-184, we investigated its effect on cell cycle
progression and apoptosis in the cell lines. Fluorescence-activated
cell sorting (FACS) analysis revealed that miR-184 overexpression
resulted in significantly higher number of cells in the G1 phase
compared with the scrambled negative control. As indicated in
Fig. 4C, the effect of miR-184 on G1 arrest in Kelly cells was largely
at the expense of S phase cells with a minimal change in the G2-M
cell population. Cell number reduction was also associated with a
marked increase in apoptosis (Fig. 4C). miR-184–induced apoptosis was further confirmed by examining caspase activity after
transfection. Caspase-3 and caspase-7 enzymatic activities (key
executioners of apoptosis) increased significantly (up to f2-fold)
by 72 h after transfection in cells treated with the miRNA
precursor relative to the scrambled RNA–transfected control cells
(Fig. 4D).

Discussion
MNA neuroblastomas are the most clinically aggressive subtype
(2) so that the patterns of miRNA expression that are associated
with this subtype are also correlated with a poor clinical outcome.
MYCN can act as either a transcriptional repressor or activator
depending on the locus in question (29), so it is tempting to
speculate that overexpression of MYCN mediates a tumorigenic
effect by down-regulating several miRNAs that are involved with
neural cell differentiation or apoptosis.
Several findings reported in this paper are consistent with the
concept that MYCN either directly or indirectly regulates the
expression of several miRNAs that are involved with neuroblastoma pathogenesis. First, miRNAs have a nearly inverse pattern of
expression in MNA tumors relative to other tumor subtypes, with
the majority of miRNAs being dramatically underexpressed in the
MNA tumor subtype. Second, ATRA, which causes the downregulation of MYCN before neural differentiation (30), also leads
to the up-regulation of several miRNA loci that are downregulated in MNA tumors, along with the down-regulation of
miRNAs that are up-regulated in the primary tumors. Although
there are a couple of exceptions to the direction of change in
miRNA expression, this seems to be a general pattern. Finally, and
most significantly, direct siRNA-based inhibition of MYCN activity
leads to very similar alterations in miRNA expression levels in
MNA cell lines. Thus, it seems quite likely that MYCN either

with scrambled control oligonucleotides. miR-184
slowed down cell proliferation in both cell lines but had
a more dramatic effect in the MNA Kelly cell line.

The number of apoptotic cells increased in the Kelly
cells overexpressing miR-184 (2.7-fold), and there
was a substantial number of cells arrested at G1
(54% versus 75.5%). D, analysis of caspase-3/
caspase-7 activity in Kelly and SK-N-AS cells
transfected with scrambled oligonucleotide
(white column ) or pre-miR-184 (black column ). Both
cell lines show an increase in apoptotic cells using the
caspase-3/caspase-7 assay. Consistent with the
MTT cell viability assay, the increase was more
dramatic in the MNA Kelly cell line than in the MYCN
single-copy cell line SK-N-AS. Bars, SD.

In summary, we have shown that exposure of neuroblastoma
cells to ATRA causes profound alterations in miRNA expression
levels and that direct siRNA inhibition of MYCN causes similar
miRNA expressional alterations. Overexpression of miR-184, one
of the most significantly altered miRNAs in the ATRA and
siRNA experiments, causes massive apoptosis when introduced
into Kelly or SK-N-AS cells, leading us to conclude that miRNAs
have potential as therapeutic targets for the treatment of
neuroblastoma and warrant substantial future studies.

miR-216 and miR-150, was the distinguishing feature of 11q
tumors, which have a suboptimal clinical outcome not too different
from MNA tumors (3). Although some discrimination between
11q and low-stage hyperdiploid tumors was observed, these
tumors could not be distinguished based on miRNA expression
profiling with perfect accuracy. Interestingly, similar clustering
patterns for hyperdiploid, 11q , and MNA tumors were observed
based on mRNA expression profiling (5, 6), which is not surprising
given that mRNA levels can be affected by miRNAs (37, 38). Thus,
clustering based on both mRNA and miRNA expression profiling
suggests that hyperdiploid tumors and 11q tumors are more
similar genetically to each other than either is to MNA tumors in
spite of the fact that 11q tumors have unfavorable clinical
outcomes. It seems likely that expression profiling with additional
miRNA loci may lead to better classification in future studies,
particularly because f20% of the loci used in the current study
were differentially expressed.
