BACKGROUND: Despite the high complete response rates achieved with fludarabine-based regimens, relapse is inevitable in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Relapsed patients often acquire deletions of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del[17p]), which are closely associated with tumor protein 53 (TP53) mutations. Wild-type p53 up-regulates
and activates B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2)-associated X protein (BAX), and it down-regulates and inactivates
BCL-2. The small-molecule BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-737 induces apoptosis in a BAX-dependent and BCL-2 homologous
antagonist-killer (BAK)-dependent manner. The role of p53 in sensitivity of CLL cells to BCL-2 inhibition has not been
extensively investigated. METHODS: The authors investigated the association of del(17p) with ABT-737 sensitivity in
CLL cells from 50 patients. Stable p53 and BAX knockdown cells were used for mechanistic studies. RESULTS: CLL
cells with del(17p) were less sensitive to ABT-737-induced BAX activation and apoptosis than CLL cells without
del(17p) (39%  7.3% vs 63.7%  2.9% [specific annexin V induction]; P < .01). A positive correlation between the
degrees of apoptosis induced by ABT-737 and by the p53-activating binding protein homolog murine double minute
(MDM2) antagonist nutlin-3a (correlation coefficient [r] ¼ 0.75; P < .0001) was observed. CLL cells with del(17p)
expressed lower levels of BAX than those without del(17p) (0.67  0.12 vs 1.27  0.10 in relative protein expression
levels; P < .01). Knockdown of p53 or BAX in leukemia cells resulted in decreased apoptosis induced by ABT-737.
CONCLUSIONS: The current data indicated that p53 dysfunction may lead to decreased apoptosis induction by ABTC 2011 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Despite the high complete response rates achieved with fludarabine-based regimens, relapse is inevitable in chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).1-3 Relapsed patients often acquire deletions in the short arm of chromosome 17 (del[17p]),
which correspond to loss of the tumor suppressor TP53, commonly accompanied by TP53 mutation of the remaining allele.4 Relapsed CLL patients with del(17p) are resistant to most standard therapies, and patients with CLL who have
del(17p) do not even benefit from first-line fludarabine-based regimens.2,3
ABT-737, a small-molecule inhibitor of B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), BCL-like-1 long form (BCL-XL), and
BCL-2 like (BCL-W), induces apoptosis in a BCL-2-associated X protein (BAX)-dependent and BCL-2 homologous antagonist killer (BAK)-dependent manner.5,6 Primary CLL cells express high BCL-2 levels, and it is noteworthy that these
cells depend on BCL-2 for survival.7,8 Studies of sensitivity to ABT-737 have in common 2 results: 1) cells with BCL-2
primed with high levels of activators like Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death (BIM) tend to be sensitive to ABT-737,
and 2) high expression of myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (BCL-2-related) (MCL-1) or the prosurvival Bcl-2 family
member BFL-1/A1 can result in decreased sensitivity to ABT-737.8-13 It has been reported that BAX levels negatively

correlate with sensitivity to ABT-737 in diffuse large Bcell lymphoma cell lines.9 However, it remains unknown
whether cellular BAX levels in primary neoplastic cells
affect susceptibility to BCL-2 inhibition.
The balance of antiapoptotic BCL-2 and proapoptotic BAX dictates cellular fate.14 Wild-type p53, but not
mutant p53, up-regulates and activates BAX and downregulates and inactivates BCL-2.15-17 The role of p53 in
sensitivity of leukemic cells to BCL-2 inhibition is
unknown. Here, we investigated the potential therapeutic
utility of the BCL-2 antagonists in CLL, focusing on the
possible association of defective p53 with sensitivity to
ABT-737.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents
ABT-737 was synthesized at the University of Texas
M.D. Anderson Cancer Center based on the previously
published structure.5 Nutlin-3a was kindly provided by
Dr. Lyubomir Vassilev (Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., New
York, NY). The caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK was purchased from Axxora (San Diego, Calif).
Clinical Data and Cell Culture
Heparinized peripheral blood samples were obtained from
patients with CLL after we obtained informed consent
through the Lymphoma Specialized Programs of Research
Excellence (SPORE) grant sample core, according to
institutional guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki.
Lymphocytes were purified and cultured in minimal essential medium-a medium supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum at a density of 2.5  106 cell/mL. We treated
cells with 10 nM ABT-737 based on a previous study in
which it was determined that the effective concentration
inducing 50% killing as measured by positive annexin V
expression was 27 nM at 4 hours and 4.5 nM at 48 hours
in CLL samples.8 Immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable
gene (IgVH) somatic mutation status was determined as
described previously.18 Somatic hypermutation in the
IgVH heavy-chain variable locus was classified as absent
when 98% homology to the germline sequence was
measured. The mutation status was designated as unmutated if <2% mutations (>98% homology to germline
sequences) or as mutated if 2% mutations (98% homology to germline sequences) were detected compared with
the germline sequences in VBASE2 (Intergenomics, Bioinformatics Competence Center, Braunschweig, Germany;
http://www.vbase2.org [accessed October 1, 2010]).19

Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization was
performed to detect 13q14, 11q22, 17p13, and trisomy
12. Patient samples were classified as positive for f-chainassociated protein kinase 70 (ZAP-70) when at least 20%
of cells were positive and positive for cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38 [adenosine diphosphate ribose hydrolase])
when at least 30% of cells were positive. Human acute
lymphoblastic leukemia REH cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md) and human acute myeloid
leukemia MOLM-13 cells (German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany)
were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10%
fetal calf serum. REH and MOLM-13 cells were transduced with retroviruses encoding either p53-specific
short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) (nucleotides 611-629;
Genbank no. NM000546), BAX-specific shRNA (nucleotides 268-286; Genbank no. NM138761.3), or negative
control shRNA, and stable shRNA-expressing cells were
generated.20
Transfection of BAX Small-Interfering RNA
Five primary CLL samples were transfected with BAX
small-interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides (SignalSilence Bax SiRNA; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly,
Mass) by the Amaxa electroporator Nucleofector II, using
the Human B Cell Nucleofector Kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Amaxa Biosystem, Cologne,
Germany). Nonspecific, scrambled siRNA served as negative control. Twenty-four hours after transfection, BAX
and b-actin expression levels were analyzed by Western
blot analysis.
Antibodies
The following antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal
anti-p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif),
mouse monoclonal anti-BCL-2 (Dako Cytomation, Carpinteria, Calif), rabbit polyclonal anti-BAX (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif), mouse monoclonal anti-BAX
(Trevigen, Gaithersburg, Md), mouse monoclonal antiMCL-1 (BD Biosciences); rabbit polyclonal anti-p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis (anti-PUMA) (EMD
Biosciences, San Diego, Calif), mouse monoclonal antiphorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced protein 1 (antiNOXA) (EMD Biosciences), and mouse monoclonal
anti-b-actin (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo).
Apoptosis Analysis
Apoptosis was measured by using the annexin V binding
assay. The extent of apoptosis was quantified as

RESULTS
CLL Cells With Del(17p) Are Resistant to
Nutlin-3a and Less Sensitive to ABT-737
We examined the proapoptotic effects of the MDM2 inhibitor nutlin-3a and the BCL-2 antagonist ABT-737 on

primary cells from 50 patients with CLL. Table 1 summarizes the clinical characteristics of the patients. Cells were
exposed to 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide, 10 lM nutlin-3a, or
10 nM ABT-737 for 48 hours. The status of p53 is the
major determinant of response to nutlin-3a in CLL21,22;
and as expected, CLL cells with del(17p) (n ¼ 8) were resistant to nutlin-3a versus CLL cells without del(17p)
(n ¼ 42; 5.5%  1.0% vs 59%  3% specific apoptosis;
P < .01). It is noteworthy that CLL cells with del(17p)
also were less sensitive to ABT-737 (39%  7.3% vs
63.7%  2.9% specific apoptosis; P < .01). We also
observed that the extent of apoptosis induced by ABT737 correlated with that induced by nutlin-3a (r ¼ 0.75;
P < .0001) (Fig. 1a). Sensitivity to ABT-737 was independent of other prognostic parameters, including IgVH
status, 11q deletion, previous treatments, and CD38 or
ZAP-70 positivity (Table 2). We also investigated whether
these prognostic parameters were associated with sensitivity
to nutlin-3a. The presence of del(17p) was the only factor
that affected nutlin-3a sensitivity (Table 3). The involvement of BAX conformational change was analyzed in 21
primary samples (7 samples with del[17p] and 14 samples
without del[17p] as controls). We could not obtain the
eighth del(17p) sample, because the patient did not return
to the hospital during the study period. Z-VAD-FMK
(100 lM) was used to inhibit caspase-promoted conformational change in BAX. Increases in the percentage
of conformationally active, BAX-positive cells were significantly smaller in 17p-deleted samples than in samples
without del(17p) (39%  6.2% vs 64.6%  3.7% specific
apoptosis; P < .01) (Fig. 1b). There was a significant, positive correlation between the percentage of specific annexin
V induction and that of specific BAX activation (Fig. 1c)
(r ¼ 0.72; P < .01), suggesting a direct role of BAX activation in apoptosis induction by ABT-737.

analyzed expression levels of BCL-2, MCL-1, BAX,
PUMA, and NOXA. BAX levels were lower in 17pdeleted samples than in samples without del(17p) (Fig.
2a). Levels of BCL-2, MCL-1, PUMA, and NOXA were
independent of del(17p). Because MCL-1 protein levels,
which reportedly determine cell sensitivity to ABT-737,
were low in CLL cells (Fig. 2a),8 real-time quantitative
PCR was used to measure MCL-1 transcription. MCL-1
mRNA levels were not affected significantly by the presence or absence of del(17p) (Fig. 2b).

ABT-737 Does Not Induce p53 Responses in
CLL Cells
To exclude the possibility that ABT-737 induces p53
responses in CLL cells, 3 patient samples with known
wild-type p53 were treated with 10 nM ABT-737 for 6
hours, and cellular p53 levels and mRNA levels of p53 targets were determined. Figure 3a,b indicated that ABT737 treatment did not increase p53 levels or induce p53related genes BAX, PUMA, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A [p21]), FAS, or MDM2.

Figure 3. ABT-737 itself does not induce p53 response. (a)
Three chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) samples with wildtype p53 were treated for 6 hours with 10 nM ABT-737, 10 lM
nutlin-3a, or vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]). Then, p53
expression levels were measured as mean fluorescence intensity ratio (MFIR) calculated with the formula MFIR ¼ (MFI for
anti-p53 antibody)/(MFI for isotypic control). Samples that
were treated with nutlin-3a expressed significantly higher levels of p53 (MFIR, 2.49  0.35) than untreated cells (MFIR,
1.37  0.12) or ABT-737-treated cells (MFIR, 1.23  0.02). (b)

p53 Knockdown in Leukemia Cells Leads to
Reduced BAX Levels and Decreased
ABT-737 Sensitivity
Because there are no CLL cell lines available, we used the
REH and MOLM-13 cell lines for knockdown experiments. REH cells with p53 knockdown displayed
reduced levels of BAX and were less susceptible to ABT737-induced apoptosis than parental cells or cells that
expressed negative control shRNA (Fig. 4a), suggesting
that functional p53 expression may be required for full
induction of apoptosis by ABT-737. Desensitization of
leukemia cells to ABT-737 also was observed in p53knockdown MOLM-13 cells, in which steady-state Bax
mRNA levels were reduced by 30.2% compared with
negative control shRNA-expressing cells (Fig. 4b,c). To
determine whether BAX levels affect leukemia cell sensitivity to ABT-737, BAX levels were reduced in REH and
MOLM-13 cells. Figure 5 indicates that BAX knockdown cells were less sensitive to ABT-737-induced apoptosis than cells that expressed scrambled shRNA in both
cell lines (P < .01), suggesting that BAX levels affect cell
susceptibility to ABT-737 in leukemia cells. Gene silencing by RNA interference could not be accomplished in
primary CLL cells because of poor transfection efficiency
and high cellular toxicity.

DISCUSSION
We, here report that CLL cells with del(17p), an
adverse prognostic factor closely associated with TP53
mutations,23 are less sensitive to ABT-737 than those
without del(17p). We also observed a positive correlation between apoptosis induced by ABT-737 and nutlin-3a. Because sensitivity to nutlin-3a largely relies on
p53 status in CLL, our data suggest that BCL-2 inhibition may require functional p53 signaling to fully
induce apoptosis. Other prognostic markers or clinical

parameters did not affect ABT-737 sensitivity, in agreement with previous studies.8,13 An association of p53
status with ABT-737 sensitivity has not been investigated extensively in CLL. Mason et al, in a series of
30 patients with CLL, reported that 3 patients who
had del(17p) displayed sensitivity to ABT-737 similar
to that displayed by patients without del(17p).24 Conversely, Balakrishnan et al, in a series of 32 patients,
reported a single patient with del(17p) who had limited apoptosis in response to ABT-737.25 Because

Figure 5. B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2
(BCL-2)-associated X protein (BAX) modulates leukemia cell
sensitivity to ABT-737. Transduced (Top) REH cells or (Bottom) MOLM-13 cells (virus encoding either negative control
short hairpin RNA [shRNA] [shC] or BAX-specific shRNA
[shBAX]) were incubated with ABT-737 for 24 hours, and the
annexin V-positive (annexin Vþ) fractions were measured by
flow cytometry ( indicates negative). Results are expressed
as the mean  standard deviation. Intensity of the immunoblot signals was determined by densometry using NIH
ImageJ software (version 1.44; National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda, Md), and the intensity of BAX relative to that of bactin was calculated. An asterisk indicates P < .01.

del(17p) and p53 mutations are closely associated with
fludarabine resistance and disease progression,26 the hypothesis that p53 status affects clinical response to
ABT-737 could be validated in patients with refractory
CLL undergoing clinical trials with ABT-737.
Although it has been reported that the expression of
BAX is up-regulated at the transcriptional level by p53,27
CLL cells with del(17p) expressed BAX to some extent,
possibly because nondeleted or nonmutated alleles would
maintain low levels of BAX. In addition, it has been
reported that BAX can be post-translationally regulated by
BCL-2,28 which is overexpressed in CLL.7,8 Furthermore,

1030

TA-p73, a p53 family protein, reportedly transcriptionally up-regulated BAX in the absence of p53.29 Future
studies are required to clarify whether p53-independent
regulators of BAX contribute to ABT-737 resistance. Bax
expression may not be the only determinant of reduced
sensitivity to ABT-737 in CLL cells with del(17p).
Because steady-state mRNA expression levels of ‘‘apoptotic’’ p53 target genes were modestly but widely repressed
in association with stable p53 knockdown (Fig. 4c),
cumulative changes in aberrantly expressed apoptosisregulating proteins may directly or indirectly reduce
ABT-737 sensitivity in patients with defective p53.
In conclusion, our data indicate that p53 dysfunction may lead to decreased apoptosis induction by ABT737 in CLL cells and that BAX levels may dictate sensitivity to BCL-2 inhibition. Recently, Letai et al proposed 3
classes of apoptotic blocks used to maintain cancer survival against BCL-2 inhibition.30 Our case may represent
the class B block, in which cancer cells eliminate the effector arm of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by reducing or eliminating BAX and BAK. Because the
conventional agents used in CLL treatment, including alkylating agents, fludarabine, and rituximab, kill CLL cells
through the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, decreased
BAX in del(17p) cells may contribute to resistance to these
agents.3 Patients with defective p53 may be considered for
alternative treatment approaches, including early stem cell
transplantation,31 if BCL-2 inhibitors and other promising agents in clinical trials do not provide sufficient clinical responses in this specific subgroup.
