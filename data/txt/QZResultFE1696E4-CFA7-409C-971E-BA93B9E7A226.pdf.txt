Abstract
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has used the latest sequencing and analysis methods to
identify somatic variants across thousands of tumours. Here we present data and analytical results
for point mutations and small insertions/deletions from 3,281 tumours across 12 tumour types as
part of the TCGA Pan-Cancer effort. We illustrate the distributions of mutation frequencies, types
and contexts across tumour types, and establish their links to tissues of origin, environmental/
carcinogen influences, and DNA repair defects. Using the integrated data sets, we identified 127
significantly mutated genes from well-known(forexample, mitogen-activatedprotein kinase,
phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase,Wnt/β-catenin and receptor tyrosine kinase signalling pathways,
and cell cycle control) and emerging (for example, histone, histone modification, splicing,
metabolism and proteolysis) cellular processes in cancer. The average number of mutations in
these significantly mutated genes varies across tumour types; most tumours have two to six,

indicating that the numberof driver mutations required during oncogenesis is relatively small.
Mutations in transcriptional factors/regulators show tissue specificity, whereas histone modifiers
are often mutated across several cancer types. Clinical association analysis identifies genes having
a significant effect on survival, and investigations of mutations with respect to clonal/subclonal
architecture delineate their temporal orders during tumorigenesis. Taken together, these results lay
the groundwork for developing new diagnostics and individualizing cancer treatment.

The advancement of DNA sequencing technologies now enables the processing of thousands
of tumours of many types for systematic mutation discovery. This expansion of scope,
coupled with appreciable progress in algorithms1–5, has led directly to characterization of
significant functional mutations, genes and pathways6–18. Cancer encompasses more than
100 related diseases19, making it crucial to understand the commonalities and differences
among various types and subtypes. TCGA was founded to address these needs, and its large
data sets are providing unprecedented opportunities for systematic, integrated analysis.
We performed a systematic analysis of 3,281 tumours from 12 cancer types to investigate
underlying mechanisms of cancer initiation and progression. We describe variable mutation
frequencies and contexts and their associations with environmental factors and defects in
DNA repair. We identify 127 significantlymutated genes (SMGs) from diverse signalling
and enzymatic processes. The finding of a TP53-driven breast, head and neck, and ovarian
cancer cluster with a dearth of other mutations in SMGs suggests common therapeutic
strategies might be applied for these tumours. We determined interactions among mutations
and correlated mutations in BAP1, FBXW7 and TP53 with detrimental phenotypes across
several cancer types. The subclonal structure and transcription status of underlying somatic
mutations reveal the trajectory of tumour progression in patients with cancer.

Standardization of mutation data

Author Manuscript

Stringent filters (Methods) were applied to ensure high quality mutation calls for 12 cancer
types: breast adenocarcinoma (BRCA), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), lung squamous cell
carcinoma (LUSC), uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), glioblastoma
multiforme (GBM), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), colon and rectal
carcinoma(COAD, READ), bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), kidney renal clear cell
carcinoma (KIRC), ovarian serous carcinoma (OV) and acute myeloid leukaemia (LAML;
conventionally called AML) (Supplementary Table 1). A total of 617,354 somatic
mutations, consisting of 398,750 missense, 145,488 silent, 36,443 nonsense, 9,778 splice
site, 7,693 non-coding RNA, 523 non-stop/readthrough, 15,141 frameshift insertions/
deletions (indels) and 3,538 inframe indels, were included for downstream analyses
(Supplementary Table 2).

Distinct mutation frequencies and sequence context
Figure 1a shows that AML has the lowest median mutation frequency and LUSC the highest
(0.28 and 8.15 mutations per megabase (Mb), respectively). Besides AML, all types average
over 1 mutation per Mb, substantially higher than in paediatric tumours20. Clustering21
illustrates that mutation frequencies for KIRC, BRCA, OV and AML are normally

distributed within a single cluster, whereas other types have several clusters (for example, 5
and 6 clusters in UCEC and COAD/READ, respectively) (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table
3a, b). In UCEC, the largest patient cluster has a frequency of approximately 1.5 mutations
per Mb, and the cluster with the highest frequency is more than 150 times greater. Multiple
clusters suggest that factors other than age contribute to development in these tumours14,16.
Indeed, there is a significant correlation between high mutation frequency and DNA repair
pathway genes (for example, PRKDC, TP53 and MSH6) (Supplementary Table 3c).
Notably, PRKDC mutations are associated with high frequency in BLCA, COAD/READ,
LUAD and UCEC, whereas TP53 mutations are related with higher frequencies in AML,
BLCA, BRCA, HNSC, LUAD, LUSC and UCEC (all P < 0.05). Mutations in POLQ and
POLE associate with highfrequencies in multiple cancer types; POLE association in UCEC
is consistent with previous observations14.

Comparison of spectra across the 12 types (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 3d) reveals
that LUSC and LUAD contain increased C>A transversions, a signature of cigarette smoke
exposure10. Sequence context analysis across 12 types revealed the largest difference being
in C>T transitions and C>G transversions (Fig. 1c). The frequency of thymine 1-bp (base
pair) upstream of C>G transversions is markedly higher in BLCA, BRCA and HNSC than in
other cancer types (Extended Data Fig. 1). GBM, AML, COAD/READ and UCEC have
similar contexts in that the proportions of guanine 1 base downstream of C>T transitions are
between 59% and 67%, substantially higher than the approximately 40% in other cancer
types. Higher frequencies of transition mutations at CpG in gastrointestinal tumours,
including colorectal, were previously reported22. We found three additional cancer types
(GBM, AML and UCEC) clustered in the C>T mutation at CpG, consistent with previous
findings of aberrant DNA methylation in endometrial cancer23 and glioblastoma24. BLCA
has a unique signature for C>T transitions compared to the other types (enriched for TC)
(Extended Data Fig. 1).
Significantly mutated genes

Author Manuscript

Genes under positive selection, either in individual or multiple tumour types, tend to display
higher mutation frequencies above background. Our statistical analysis3, guided by
expression data and curation (Methods), identified 127 such genes (SMGs; Supplementary
Table 4). These SMGs are involved in a wide range of cellular processes, broadly classified
into 20 categories (Fig. 2), including transcription factors/regulators, histone modifiers,
genome integrity, receptor tyrosine kinase signalling, cell cycle, mitogen-activated protein
kinases (MAPK) signalling, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K) signalling, Wnt/βcatenin signalling,histones, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and splicing (Fig. 2). The
identification of MAPK, PI(3)K and Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathways is consistent with
classical cancer studies. Notably, newer categories (for example, splicing, transcription
regulators, metabolism, proteolysis and histones) emerge as exciting guides for the
development of new therapeutic targets. Genes categorized as histone modifiers (Z = 0.57),
PI(3)K signalling (Z = 1.03), and genome integrity (Z = 0.66) all relate to more than one
cancer type, whereas transcription factor/regulator (Z = 0.40), TGF-β signalling (Z = 0.66),
and Wnt/β-catenin signalling (Z = 0.55) genes tend to associate with single types (Methods).

Notably, 3,053 out of 3,281 total samples (93%) across the Pan-Cancer collection had at
least one non-synonymous mutation in at least one SMG. The average number of point
mutations and small indels in these genes varies across tumour types, with the highest (~6
mutations per tumour) in UCEC, LUAD and LUSC, and the lowest (~2 mutations per
tumour) in AML, BRCA, KIRC and OV. This suggests that the numbers of both cancerrelated genes (only 127 identified in this study) and cooperating driver mutations required
during oncogenesis are small (most cases only had 2–6) (Fig. 3), although large-scale
structural rearrangements were not included in this analysis.
Common mutations

Author Manuscript

The most frequently mutated gene in the Pan-Cancer cohort is TP53 (42% of samples). Its
mutations predominate in serous ovarian (95%) and serous endometrial carcinomas (89%)
(Fig. 2). TP53 mutations are also associated with basal subtype breast tumours. PIK3CA is
the second most commonly mutated gene, occurring frequently (>10%) in most cancer types
except OV, KIRC, LUAD and AML. PIK3CA mutations frequented UCEC (52%) and
BRCA (33.6%), being specifically enriched in luminal subtype tumours. Tumours lacking
PIK3CA mutations often had mutations in PIK3R1, with the highest occurrences in UCEC
(31%) and GBM (11%) (Fig. 2).
Many cancer types carried mutations in chromatin re-modelling genes. In particular, histonelysine N-methyltransferase genes (MLL2 (also known as KMT2D), MLL3 (KMT2C) and
MLL4 (KMT2B)) cluster in bladder, lung and endometrial cancers, whereas the lysine (K)specific demethylase KDM5C is prevalently mutated in KIRC (7%). Mutations in ARID1A
are frequent in BLCA, UCEC, LUAD and LUSC, whereas mutations in ARID5B
predominate in UCEC (10%) (Fig. 2).

Author Manuscript

KRAS and NRAS mutations are typically mutually exclusive, with recurrent activating
mutations (KRAS (Gly 12), KRAS (Gly 13) and NRAS (Gln 61)) common in COAD/READ
(30%, 5% and 5%, respectively), UCEC (15%, 4% and 2%) and LUAD (24%, 1% and 2%).
EGFR mutations are frequent in GBM (27%) and LUAD (11%). Recurrent, gain-of-function
mutations in IDH1 (Arg 132) and/or IDH2 (Arg 172) typify GBM and AML
(Supplementary Table 2 and Fig. 2). Although KRAS residues Gly 12 and Gly 13 are
commonly mutated in LUAD, COAD/READ and UCEC, the proportion of Gly12Cys
changes is significantly higher in lung cancer (P < 3.2 × 10–10), resulting from the high C>A
transversion rate (Extended Data Fig. 2).
Tumour-type-specific mutations

Author Manuscript

Signature mutations exclusive to KIRC include those affecting VHL (52%) and PBRM1
(33%) (Fig. 2). Mutations to BAP1 (10%) and SETD2 (12%) are also most common in
KIRC. Transcription factor CTCF, ribosome component RPL22, and histone modifiers
ARID1A and ARID5B have the highest frequencies in UCEC. Predominant COAD/READspecific mutations are those affecting APC (82%) and Wnt/β-catenin signalling (93% of
samples). Several mutations occur exclusively in AML, including recurrent mutations in
NPM1 (27%) and FLT3 (27%), and rare mutations affecting MIR142 (Fig. 2). Mutations of
methylation and chromatin modifiers are also typical in AML, mostly affecting DNMT3A

and TET2. BRCA-specific mutations include GATA3 and MAP3K1, whereas KEAP1
mutations predominate in lung cancer (LUAD 17%, LUSC 12%). EPHA3 (9%), SETBP1
(13%) and STK11 (9%) are characteristic in LUAD.

Shared and cancer type-specific mutation signatures

Author Manuscript

Cluster analysis on mutations in SMGs (Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 3) showed 72%
(1,881 of 2,611) of tumours are adjacent to those from the same tissue type. Notably,
clustering identified several dominant groups in UCEC, COAD, GBM, AML, KIRC, OV
and BRCA. Two major endometrial endometroid clusters were found, one having mutations
in PIK3CA, PTEN and ARID1A, and the other containing mutations in two additional genes
(PIK3R1 and CTNNB1). Five major breast cancer clusters were observed, with mutations in
CDH1, GATA3, MAP3K1, PIK3CA and TP53 as drivers for respective clusters. The TP53driven cluster is adjacent to an HNSC cluster and an ovarian cancer cluster, all having a
dearth of other SMG mutations (Fig. 4). The glioblastoma cluster is characterized by
mutations in EGFR. Two kidney clear cell cancer clusters were detected; both have VHL as
the common driver and one has additional mutations in PBRM1 and/or BAP1 (refs 25–27).
PBRM1 and BAP1 mutations are mutually exclusive in KIRC (P = 0.006), consistent with
previous reports26,28. AML has three major clusters represented by various combinations of
DNMT3A, NPM1 and FLT3 mutations, and one cluster dominated by RUNX1 mutations.
One cluster having APC and KRAS mutations was almost exclusively detected in COAD/
READ. Tumours from BLCA, HNSC, LUAD and LUSC are largely scattered over the PanCancer cohort, indicating extensive heterogeneity in these diseases.
Mutual exclusivity and co-occurrence among SMGs

Author Manuscript

Pairwise exclusivity and co-occurrence analysis for the 127 SMGs found 14 mutually
exclusive (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05) and 148 co-occurring (FDR < 0.05) pairs
(Supplementary Table 6). TP53 and CDH1 are exclusive in BRCA, with mutations enriched
in different subtypes13, as are TP53 and CTNNB1 in UCEC. Cohort analysis identified pairs
where at least one gene has mutations strongly associated (corrected P < 0.05) to one cancer
type, and also identifies TP53 and PIK3CA with significant exclusivity (Extended Data Fig.
4). Pairs with significant co-occurrence include IDH1 and ATRX in GBM29, TP53 and
CDKN2A in HNSC, and TBX3 and MLL4 in LUAD.

Author Manuscript

Dendrix30 identified a set of five genes (TP53, PTEN, VHL, NPM1 and GATA3) having
strong mutual exclusivity (P < 0.01) (Extended Data Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table 7).
Not surprisingly, many are associated (P < 0.05) with one cancer type (for example, VHL
mutations in KIRC), demonstrating a strong relationship between exclusivity and tissue of
origin. When 600 non-cancer-type-specific genes were added to the analysis (Methods), we
identified another set consisting of TP53, PIK3CA, PIK3R1, SETD2 and WT1 (P < 0.01;
Extended Data Fig. 5b and Supplementary Table 7). Dendrix also finds genes with strong
mutual exclusivity from each cancer type separately (Extended Data Fig. 5c), allowing
calculation of ‘cancer exclusivity’. KIRC has the strongest exclusivity from the other 11
cancer types, followed by AML with clear exclusivity from BRCA and UCEC. Conversely,
COAD/READ displayed the greatest cooccurrence with other cancer types (Extended Data
Fig. 5d).

Clinical correlation across tumour types

Author Manuscript

We examined how clinical features (Supplementary Table 8) correlate with somatic events
in 127 SMGs within tumour types. Some findings are unsurprising, such as the correlation
of TP53 mutations with generally unfavourable indicators, for example in tumour stage (P =
0.01, Fisher's exact test) and elapsed time to death (P = 0.006, Wilcoxon) in HNSC, age (P =
0.002, Wilcoxon rank test) and time to death (P = 0.09, Wilcoxon) in AML, and vital status
in OV (P = 0.04, Fisher). In UCEC, mutations in several genes are correlated with the
endometrioid rather than serous subtype: PTEN, CTNNB1, PIK3R1, KRAS, ARID1A, CTCF,
RPL22 and ARID5B (all P < 0.03) (Supplementary Table 9).

Author Manuscript

We examined which genes correlate with survival using the Cox proportional hazards
model, first analysing individual cancer types using age and gender as covariates; an average
of 2 genes (range: 0–4) with mutation frequency ≥2% were significant (P ≤ 0.05) in each
type (Supplementary Table 10a and Extended Data Fig. 6). KDM6A and ARID1A mutations
correlate with better survival in BLCA (P = 0.03, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.36, 95% confidence
interval (CI): 0.14–0.92) and UCEC (P = 0.03, HR = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.01–0.84), respectively,
but mutations in SETBP1, recently identified with worse prognosis in atypical chronic
myeloid leukaemia (aCML)31, have a significant detrimental effect in HNSC (P = 0.006, HR
= 3.21, 95% CI: 1.39–7.44). BAP1 strongly correlates with poor survival (P = 0.00079, HR
= 2.17, 95% CI: 1.38–3.41) in KIRC. Conversely, BRCA2 mutations (P = 0.02, HR = 0.31,
95% CI: 0.12–0.85) associate with better survival in ovarian cancer, consistent with previous
reports32,33; BRCA1 mutations showed positive correlation with better survival, but did not
reach significance here.

We extended our survival analysis across cancer types, restricting our attention to the subset
of 97 SMGs whose mutations appeared in ≥2% of patients having survival data in ≥2 tumour
types. Taking type, age and gender as covariates, we found 7 significant genes: BAP1,
DNMT3A, HGF, KDM5C, FBXW7, BRCA2 and TP53 (Extended Data Table 1). In
particular, BAP1 was highly significant (P = 0.00013, HR = 2.20, 95% CI: 1.47–3.29, more
than 53 mutated tumours out of 888 total), with mutations associating with detrimental
outcome in four tumour types and notable associations in KIRC (P = 0.00079), consistent
with a recent report28, and in UCEC (P = 0.066). Mutations in several other genes are
detrimental, including DNMT3A (HR = 1.59), previously identified with poor prognosis in
AML34, and KDM5C (HR = 1.63), FBXW7 (HR = 1.57) and TP53 (HR = 1.19). TP53 has
significant associations with poor outcome in KIRC (P = 0.012), AML (P = 0.0007) and
HNSC (P = 0.00007). Conversely, BRCA2 (P = 0.05, HR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.38 to 0.99)
correlates with survival benefit in six types, including OV and UCEC (Supplementary Table
10a, b). IDH1 mutations are associated with improved prognosis across the Pan-Cancer set
(HR = 0.67, P = 0.16) and also in GBM (HR = 0.42, P = 0.09) (Supplementary Table 10a,
b), consistent with previous work35.

Driver mutations and tumour clonal architecture
To understand the temporal order of somatic events, we analysed the variant allele fraction
(VAF) distribution of mutations in SMGs across AML, BRCA and UCEC (Fig. 5a and
Supplementary Table 11a) and other tumour types (Extended Data Fig. 7). To minimize the

effect of copy number alterations, we focused on mutations in copy neutral segments.
Mutations in TP53 have higher VAFs on average in all three cancer types, suggesting early
appearance during tumorigenesis, although it is possible that a later mutation contributing to
tumour cell expansion might have a high VAF. It is worth noting that copy neutral loss of
heterozygosity is commonly found in classical tumour suppressors such as TP53, BRCA1,
BRCA2 and PTEN, leading to increased VAFs in these genes. In AML, DNMT3A
(permutation test P = 0), RUNX1 (P = 0.0003) and SMC3 (P = 0.05) have significantly
higher VAFs than average among SMGs (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table 11b). In breast
cancer, AKT1, CBFB, MAP2K4, ARID1A, FOXA1 and PIK3CA have relatively high average
VAFs. For endometrial cancer, multiple SMGs (for example, PIK3CA, PIK3R1, PTEN,
FOXA2 and ARID1A) have similar median VAFs. Conversely, KRAS and/or NRAS
mutations tend to have lower VAFs in all three tumour types (Fig. 5a), suggesting NRAS (for
example, P = 0 in AML) and KRAS (for example, P = 0.02 in BRCA) have a progression
role in a subset of AML, BRCA and UCEC tumours. For all three cancer types, we clearly
observed a shift towards higher expression VAFs in SMGs versus non-SMGs, most apparent
in BRCA and UCEC (Extended Data Fig. 8a and Methods).

Author Manuscript

Previous analysis using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) detected subclones in
approximately 50% of AML cases15,36,37; however, analysis is difficult using AML exome
owing to its relatively few coding mutations. Using 50 AML WGS cases, sciClone (http://
github.com/genome/sciclone) detected DNMT3A mutations in the founding clone for 100%
(8 out of 8) of cases and NRAS mutations in the subclone for 75% (3 out of 4) of cases
(Extended Data Fig. 8b). Among 304 and 160 of BRCA and UCEC tumours, respectively,
with enough coding mutations for clustering, 35% BRCA and 44% UCEC tumours
contained subclones. Our analysis provides the lower bound for tumour heterogeneity,
because only coding mutations were used for clustering. In BRCA, 95% (62 out of 65) of
cases contained PIK3CA mutations in the founding clone, whereas 33% (3 out of 9) of cases
had MLL3 mutations in the subclone. Similar patterns were found in UCEC tumours, with
96% (65 out of 68) and 95% (62 out of 65) of tumours containing PIK3CA and PTEN
mutations, respectively, in the founding clone, and 9% (2 out of 22) of KRAS and 14% (1
out of 7) of NRAS mutations in the subclone (Extended Data Fig. 8b and Supplementary
Table 12).

Discussion

Author Manuscript

We have performed systematic analysis of the TCGA Pan-Cancer mutation data set, finding
key insights for cancer genomes, as summarized in Extended Data Fig. 9. The data set
contains 127 diverse SMGs, demonstrating that many cellular and enzymatic processes are
involved in tumorigenesis. Notably, 66 of them are also on the ‘mut-driver genes’ list
generated by a ratiometric method using COSMIC mutations38. Although a common set of
driver mutations exists in each cancer type, the combination of drivers within a cancer type
and their distribution within the founding clone and subclones varies for individual patients.
This suggests that knowing the clonal architecture of each patient's tumour will be crucial
for optimizing their treatment.

Given the rate at which TCGA and International Cancer Genome Consortium projects are
generating genomic data, there are reasonable chances of identifying the ‘core’ cancer genes
and pathways and tumour-type-specific genes and pathways in the near term. These results
will be immediately circulated within the research community to assess their potential for
candidate targets for diverse tumour types or for specific tumour type. Ultimately, these data
and their associations with different clinical features and subtypes should contribute to the
formulation of a reference candidate gene panel for all tumour types that could be helpful for
prognosis at various clinical time points.

METHODS
Standardization and tracking of mutation data from 12 cancer types

Author Manuscript

Exome capture targets may differ among GSCs, as well as across cohorts at the same GSC
because the capture technologies and sequencing platforms continue to evolve over time.
Therefore, collecting sequencing coverage data for each sample is crucial for most variant
significance analyses. Somatic variant calling methods also differ among GSCs for similar
reasons, in addition to the fact that filtering strategies may be tuned to emphasize either
sensitivity or specificity of calls. Finally, the TCGA disease analysis working groups
(AWGs) may optionally perform manual curation of the variant calls, in which false
positives are removed and true negatives are recovered. AWGs and GSCs also
collaboratively select putative variants for validation or for recovering variants from regions
that reported low coverage in the first pass of exome sequencing. These steps mean that
somatic variant sensitivity and specificity are mostly comparable across samples of a given
TCGA tumour type, but that they differ considerably among tumour types, creating
significant challenges for Pan-Cancer analyses.

Author Manuscript

Author Manuscript

The three TCGA genome sequencing centres (GSCs; Baylor Human Genome Center, Broad
Institute, and The Genome Institute at Washington University) collectively performed
exome sequencing on thousands of tumour samples and matched normal tissues, the latter
being used as controls to distinguish somatic mutations from inherited variants. These
controls were most often peripheral blood, but skin tissue was used in 199 AML samples as
well as 1 buccal source, and adjacent tumour-free tissue was used for 927 cases, with 120
cases having normal DNA from blood and adjacent solid normal tissue.

Complete standardization of sensitivity could not be attained, as it would have required a
uniform variant calling and filtering workflow across all tumour–normal pairs. Instead,
publicly available somatic variant calls in mutation annotation format (MAF) files from the
TCGA were used to both ensure reproducibility and take advantage of extensive manual
curation performed over the years by experts in the disease or in genomic sequence analysis
and annotation. Specifically, all MAF files were downloaded from the TCGA data
coordinating centre, each being reprocessed to eliminate known, recurrent false positives
and germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) present in the dbSNP database. All
variant coordinates were transferred to GRCh37 and re-annotated using the Gencode human
transcript annotation imported from Ensembl release 69. Per sample, per gene coverage
values were obtained using WIG-formatted reference coverage files associated with the

BAMs or by processing the original BAM files directly. Details were tracked on Synapse
with provenance and documentation (https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn1729383).
Mutation frequency and spectrum analysis

Author Manuscript

We calculate mutation frequency by dividing the number of validated somatic variants by
the number of base pairs that have sufficient coverage. Minimum coverage is six and eight
reads for normal and tumour BAMs, respectively. For mutation spectrum we classify the
mutation by six types (transitions/transversions). Mutation context is generated by counting
the frequency of A, T, C and G nucleotides that are 2 bp 5′ and 3′ to each variant within the
six mutation categories. For the clustering, we pooled all samples (excluding hypermutators
having >500 mutations) for each cancer type. We calculated the mutation context (–2 to +2
bp) for each somatic variant in each mutation category. A hierarchical clustering was then
done using the pairwise correlation of the mutation context across all cancer types. We used
correlation modules in the mutational significance in cancer (MuSiC) package to identify
genes with mutations that are positively correlated with the number of mutations in the
tumour sample. This analysis was performed for all 12 cancer types. Only genes mutated in
at least 5% of tumours were included in the analysis. A list of genes known to be involved in
DNA mismatch repair is included Supplementary Table 13.
SMG analysis

Author Manuscript

We used the SMG test in the MuSiC suite3 to identify significant genes for each tumour type
and also for Pan-Cancer tumours. This test assigns mutations to seven categories: AT
transition, AT transversion, CG transition, CG transversion, CpG transition, CpG
transversion and indel, and then uses statistical methods based on convolution, the
hypergeometric distribution (Fisher's test), and likelihood to combine the category-specific
binomials to obtain overall P values. All P values were combined using the methods
described previously3. SMGs are listed in Fig. 2. Finally, for the analysis of SMGs, genes
not typically expressed in individual tumour type or/and Pan-Cancer tumour samples were
filtered if they had an average read per kilobase per million (RPKM) ≤ 0.5. For the RNA
sequencing (RNA-seq)-based gene expression analysis, we used the ‘Pancan12 per-sample
log2-RSEM’ matrix from Synapse (https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn1734155). A
gene qualified as ‘expressed’ if it had at least three reads in at least 70% of samples.
Annotation based curation was also performed.
Tumour specificity analysis

Author Manuscript

To make quantitative inferences as to the number of cancer types with which an individual
gene associates, we calculated the empirical distributions of frequency for each cancer
(tissue) type and declared an association (setting indicator variable to 1) if a given gene
frequency within a type exceeded a threshold. Otherwise we set the indicator to 0, indicating
no association. We took the threshold as a standardized Z-score of 0.2 above the mean based
on the estimated level of noise in the 127 significant genes as quantified by the coefficient of
variation for each cancer type. We then computed an overall distribution on the indicator
variable. The mean for each functional category having at least five genes was then

converted to a Z-score based on the descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) of
the indicator distribution.
Unsupervised clustering

Author Manuscript

Somatic point mutations and small indels of 127 SMGs across the 3,281 tumours were
collected. To reduce noise from passenger mutations, tumours having more than 500
somatic mutations (considered hypermutators) were excluded from this analysis. Tumours
with zero detected somatic mutations were also excluded, resulting in mutations from 2,611
tumours for downstream clustering analysis. A mutation status matrix (sample × gene) was
constructed and passed to the R function ‘hclust’ for complete-linkage hierarchical
clustering and a respective heatmap with a dendrogram was plotted. Tumours from BLCA,
HNSC, LUAD and LUSC are largely scattered over the Pan-Cancer cohort, indicating
extensive heterogeneity in these diseases. For instance, eight LUAD and two LUSC tumours
are in the solid colorectal cluster, largely owing to their KRAS mutations (Fig. 4). Three
UCEC, two GBM, one OV and one HSNC samples are in the BRCA cluster courtesy of
TP53 and PIK3CA mutations. The resolution of this analysis could be improved by
incorporating copy number data, structural variants, gene expression, proteomics and
methylation.
Dendrix analysis of mutation relationships

Author Manuscript

We used Fisher's exact test to identify pairs of SMGs with significant (FDR = 0.05 by
Benjamini–Hochberg) exclusivity and co-occurrence. We identified significant pairs by
analysing all samples together and by analysing samples in each cancer type separately. A
large number of pairs (142) with significant co-occurring mutations is identified only
considering the Pan-Cancer data set (Extended Data Fig. 4); these pairs include several
candidate genes (for example, NAV3, RPL22 and TSHZ3) whose function in carcinogenesis
is not well characterized.

Author Manuscript

We applied our de novo driver exclusivity (Dendrix) algorithm to identify sets of
approximately mutually exclusive mutations on all samples together. Dendrix finds a set M
of genes of maximum weight W(M), in which W(M) is the difference between the number of
samples with a mutation in M and the number of samples with more than one mutation in M.
The maximum scoring set of genes of a given size is identified using a Markov chain Monte
Carlo approach. We first applied Dendrix considering only the 127 SMGs, and then
extended our analysis to consider the 1,000 genes of smallest median q value among the
three q values (convolution, Fisher's combined test, and likelihood ratio) reported by
MuSiC. From these 1,000 genes, we discarded the ones with mutations strongly associated
(Bonferroni corrected P ≤ 0.05 by Fisher's exact test) with a cancer type, and this resulted in
600 genes for Dendrix analysis.
We also applied Dendrix to identify sets of exclusive mutations among the SMGs in each
cancer type separately. The exclusivity and co-occurrence between different sets of
mutations was assessed using Fisher's exact test, and the mutation status (‘mutated’ if at
least one gene in the set is mutated, ‘not mutated’ otherwise) of the two sets as categories for
the 2 × 2 contingency table.

Cross-cancer-type survival analysis using Cox proportional hazards model

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We used the clinical correlation module of MuSiC to examine how clinical features correlate
with somatic events within individual tumour types. Fisher's exact test was used for
analysing categorical features, and the Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for quantitative
variables. We used the standard Cox proportional hazards model for individual cancer types
as well as cross-cancer survival analysis, as implemented in the R package ‘survival’ (http://
cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/). Here, the effects of all mutations are taken to be
constant over time, that is, they are ‘stationary coefficients’. Hazard ratios exceeding 1
indicate an overall detrimental effect across cancers, whereas those below 1 associate with
better outcome. Calculations included only those genes having mutation frequencies of at
least 2% (for both individual cancer types and Pan-Cancer) in at least two cancer types (for
Pan-Cancer). In practice, this means that although some genes encompass many types, for
example, TP53 is calculated over 12 types, most are based on only a few (Extended Data
Table 1 and Supplementary Table 10a, b). There is no basis for calculation of genes having
2% mutation in only a single type, although single-type analysis was computed similarly for
all genes having at least 2% in all cancer types. Analyses were performed using age and
gender as covariates.

Author Manuscript

We also performed Pan-Cancer survival analysis by stratifying on cancer type in the Cox
regression model and found the results are largely consistent with taking cancer type as a
covariate (14 out of top 15 significant genes are overlapping from these two analyses)
(Supplementary Table 10b). Furthermore, stage was used as a covariate for individual
cancer type survival analysis (AML and COAD/READ not included). Again, the results are
fairly consistent with taking only age and gender as covariates (for example, 12 out of top 15
significant genes are overlapping from these two analyses for UCEC) (Supplementary Table
14).
Clonality and mutation VAF analysis

Author Manuscript

We computed the VAFs of somatic mutations in SMGs using TCGA targeted validation data
or/and exome and RNA sequencing data for AML, BRCA and UCEC. An internally
developed tool called Bam2ReadCount (unpublished), which counts the number of reads
supporting the reference and variant alleles, was used for computing VAFs for point
mutations and short indels in copy number neutral segments. Only mutation sites having
≥20× coverage and SMGs having at least five data points were included in downstream
analyses. Permutation and t-tests were used to identify genes with significantly higher or
lower VAFs than the average (Supplementary Table 11a, b). These indicate chronological
order-of-appearance of somatic events during tumorigenesis. VAFs for mutations from
genes that are not identified as significantly mutated were similarly computed for generating
control VAF density distribution. We also computed VAF distribution for the other nine
cancer types, and plots are included in Extended Data Fig. 7. In total, 91 BLCA, 772 BRCA,
144 COAD/READ, 62 GBM, 144 HNSC, 195 KIRC, 197 LAML, 216 LUAD, 146 LUSC,
278 OV and 248 UCEC tumours were used for SMG VAF distribution analysis.
We further investigated the expression level of somatic mutations using available RNA
sequencing data for AML, BRCA and UCEC, and then compared observed mutant allele

expressions with expected levels based on DNA VAFs (assuming no allelic expression bias).
A total of 671 BRCA, 170 AML and 190 UCEC tumours with RNA-seq BAMs were used
for this analysis. Notably, we observed at least a twofold increase of variant allele
expressions in 3.9%, 12.9% and 5.9% of mutations from SMGs in AML (for example,
TP53, STAG2 and SMC3), BRCA (for example, CDH1, TP53, GATA3 and MLL3), and
UCEC (for example, ARID1A and FGFR2), respectively (Supplementary Table 11a). We
further compared expression level distributions across mutations from SMGs and nonSMGs. For all three cancer types, we clearly observed a shift towards higher expression
VAFs in SMGs versus non-SMGs, which was most apparent in BRCA and UCEC
(Extended Data Fig. 8a). This result suggests potential selection of these mutations during
tumorigenesis.

Author Manuscript

SciClone (http://github.com/genome/sciclone) was used for generating mutation clusters
using point mutations from copy number neutral segments. Only variants with greater than
or equal to 100× coverage were used for clustering and plotting. Validation data were used
for AML, and exome sequencing data were used for BRCA and UCEC. SMGs were
highlighted automatically by sciClone to show their clonal association (Extended Data Fig.
8b).
