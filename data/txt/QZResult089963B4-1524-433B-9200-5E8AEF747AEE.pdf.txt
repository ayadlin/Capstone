ABSTRACT
Chemoresistant tumors usually fail to respond to radiotherapy. However,
the mechanisms involved in chemo- and radiotherapy cross resistance are not
fully understood. Previously, we have identified microRNA (miR)-451 as a tumor
suppressor in lung adenocarcinoma (LAD). However, whether miR-451 plays critical
roles in chemo- and radiotherapy cross resistance in LAD is unclear. Here, we
established two docetaxel-resistant LAD cell models (SPC-A1/DTX and H1299/DTX),
and showed that miR-451 was significantly downregulated in docetaxel-resistant
LAD cells. Gain - and loss - of - function assays indicated that re-expression of miR451 could reverse radioresistance of docetaxel-resistant LAD cells both in vitro and
in vivo through promoting apoptosis and DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The
proto-oncogene c-Myc was identified as a direct target of miR-451, and re-expression
of miR-451 inhibited survivin and rad-51 expression by reducing the amount of
c-Myc protein binding to their promoters. Silencing of c-Myc could phenocopy the
effects of miR-451 upregulation, and restoration of c-Myc could partially rescue the
effect of miR-451 upregulation on radiosensitivity of docetaxel-resistant LAD cells.
Therefore, dysregulation of miR-451/c-Myc-survivin/rad-51 signaling is responsible
for radioresistance of docetaxel-resistant LAD cells, and targeting it will be a potential
strategy for reversing chemo- and radiotherapy cross resistance of LAD patients.

INTRODUCTION

[3]. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in
chemo- and radiotherapy cross resistance are not fully
understood. Therefore, it is urgent to understand the
molecular mechanisms of aberrant treatment responses to
exploit the novel strategies for sensitizing chemoresistant
LAD patients to radiotherapy.
MiRNAs, a group of small noncoding RNAs,
post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by
complementary binding to the 3’-UTR of their target genes
[4]. It is well known that miRNAs are involved in a wide
range of human physiological and pathological processes,
including tumorigensis [5, 6]. Increasing evidence has
shown that dysregulation of miRNAs plays a critical
role in LAD development. For example, increased miR-

LAD, the most common histological type of lung
cancer, has been regarded as the leading cause of cancerrelated deaths for both males and females worldwide and
is always diagnosed at advanced stage [1]. The current
therapies for advanced LAD mainly include surgery,
radiation therapy, chemotherapy, local treatments and
targeted therapies [2]. Chemotherapy combined with
adjuvant radiotherapy has been utilized to improve the
survival and prognosis of patients with advanced LAD.
However, in clinic, chemoresistant LAD patients often
fail to respond to other cytotoxic treatments including
radiotherapy, which leads to poor prognosis of the patients

21 expression is reported to be associated with disease
progression and survival in stage I lung adenocarcinoma,
suggesting that expression of miR-21 may contribute to
lung carcinogenesis and serve as a therapeutic target or
early-stage prognostic biomarker for lung adenocarcinoma
[7]. In contrast, miR-145 and miR-182 are reported to be
upregulated in LAD tissues. Specific miRNAs for early
diagnosing or predicting the prognosis of LAD patients
and their correlation between miRNA expression in
tissues, serums and sputums are increasingly reported
[8]. In addition, some miRNAs are reported to play
critical roles in chemo- or radioresistance of LAD cells.
For example, we previously identified a differential
miRNA-expression profile between docetaxel-resistant
and parental LAD cells, and showed that dysregulation of
some miRNAs (miR-650, Let-7c, miR-200b and miR-100)
was linked with the chemoresistance of LAD cells [9-12].
Also, overexpression of miR-449a in lung adenocarcinoma
cell line (CL1-0) effectively increased irradiation-induced
DNA damage and apoptosis, altered the cell cycle
distribution and eventually led to sensitization of CL10 to irradiation [13]. Zhang and his colleagues showed
that miR-511 could regulate the growth of radioresistant
A549/R cells by increasing BAX expression through
TRIB2 [14]. These data suggest that miRNA replacement
therapy or anti-miRNA oligonucleotides will possess
significant potentials for molecular targeted therapy of
human malignancies. In our previous study, miR-451
was observed to be downregulated in non-small cell lung
cancer and re-expression of miR-451 could inhibit growth
and induce apoptosis in both LAD cells and squamous
cell carcinoma (SCC) cells [15]. However, the roles of
miR-451 in chemo- and radiotherapy cross resistance of
LAD cells are not better understood and need to be further
elucidated.
In the present study, we were the first to show that
re-expression of miR-451 could significantly reverse the
radioresistance of docetaxel-resistant LAD cells through
promoting apoptosis and DNA DSBs both in vitro and in
vivo. The proto-oncogene c-Myc, a key transcriptional
factor for survivin and rad-51, was identified as a direct
and functional target of miR-451. Thus, the newly
identified miR-451/c-Myc-survivin/rad-51 signaling was
linked with chemo- and radiotherapy cross resistance of
human LAD cells.

previously established in our lab [16, 17]. Specifically,
to establish docetaxel-resistant LAD cells, parental LAD
cells were continuously exposed to docetaxel for more
than 1 year until cells had acquired resistance to docetaxel.
Results from MTT assay indicated that the IC50 values
to docetaxel in SPC-A1/DTX or H1299/DTX cell lines
(605.44±46.3 μg/L or 587.83±33.4 μg/L) were significantly
higher than those in parental SPC-A1 or H1299 cell lines
(123.69±10.3 μg/L or 170.15±15.14 μg/L) (Supplementary
Figure 1A), suggesting that SPC-A1/DTX or H1299/DTX
cells had indeed acquired docetaxel resistance. To further
explore whether docetaxel-resistant LAD cells is crossresistant to radiation, we determined the 50% effective
dose (ED50) values of irradiation in docetaxel-resistant
and parental LAD cells. Results from Cell Counting
Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay indicated that the ED50 values of
irradiation in SPC-A1/DTX or H1299/DTX cell lines
(12.2±1.2 Gy or 11.1±0.9 Gy) were significantly higher
than those in parental SPC-A1 or H1299 cell lines (3.4±0.5
Gy and 3.1±0.3 Gy) (Supplementary Figure 1B). Colony
formation assays also showed significant radioresistance
in SPC-A1/DTX and H1299/DTX cells compared with
parental SPC-A1 and H1299 cells (Supplementary Figure
1C). To investigate whether cross-resistance to irradiation
was correlated with irradiation-induced apoptosis and
DNA DSBs, flow cytometry was performed to detect the
changes of apoptosis and Western blotting was performed
to detect the phosphorylation expression of H2A.X
(γ-H2A.X) protein, which was identified as a marker of
DNA DSBs. In docetaxel-resistant SPC-A1/DTX and
H1299/DTX cell lines, there was a significant decrease in
apoptosis on exposure to various doses of irradiation in
comparison with parental SPC-A1 and H1299 cell lines
(Supplementary Figure 1D). Also, the expression level of
γ-H2A.X protein in SPC-A1/DTX or H1299/DTX cells
was significantly lower than that in parental SPC-A1
or H1299 cells (Supplementary Figure 1E). Therefore,
abrogation of apoptosis and the decreased phosphorylation
expression of H2A.X foci formation might be involved in
chemo- and radiotherapy cross resistance of LAD cells.

Downregulation of miR-451 was correlated with
radioresistance of docetaxel-resistant LAD cells
Our previous study has shown that miR-451
functions as a potent tumor suppressor in human
NSCLC [15], but the roles of miR-451 in chemo- and
radiotherapy cross resistance of LAD are sill unclear.
qRT-PCR was performed to detect the expression of
miR-451 in docetaxel-resistant and parental LAD cells,
and results indicated that miR-451 was significantly
downregulated in SPC-A1/DTX and H1299/DTX cells
in comparison with the corresponding parental SPC-A1
and H1299 cells (Figure 1A). To further understand the
effect of miR-451 expression on the radiosensitivity

pcDNA/miR-NC) or Anti-miR-451 (or Anti-miR-NC) was
stably or transiently transfected into docetaxel-resistant
or parental LAD cells, respectively. The results of qRTPCR confirmed the upregulation of miR-451 in pcDNA/
miR-451-transfected SPC-A1/DTX or H1299/DTX cells
and the downregulation of miR-451 in Anti-miR-451transfected SPC-A1 or H1299 cells, in comparison with

respective control cells (Figure 1B). Then, the effect of
miR-451 expression on radiosensitivity of LAD cells was
determined by the clonogenic survival assay. The ED50
values for irradiation in miR-451-transfected SPC-A1/
DTX or H1299/DTX cells were significantly decreased by
48.0% or 56.1%, respectively, in comparison with those
in miR-NC-transfected cells (Figure 1C). Meanwhile, the

Re-expression of miR-451 significantly increases
irradiation-induced apoptosis and DNA DSBs of
docetaxel-resistant LAD cells

SPC-A1 or H1299 cells were significantly increased by
30.0% or 15.2%, respectively, in comparison with those
in Anti-miR-NC-transfected cells (Figure 1D). Compared
with that of miR-NC-transfected cells combined with
irradiation treatment (4.0Gy), the capacity of colony
formation was significantly decreased in miR-451transfected H1299/DTX or SPC-A1/DTX cells combined
with irradiation treatment (4.0Gy) (Figure 1E). Compared
with that of miR-NC-transfected cells combined with
irradiation treatment, the capacity of colony formation
was significantly increased in anti-miR-451-transfected
H1299/DTX or SPC-A1/DTX cells combined with
irradiation treatment (2.0Gy) (Figure 1F). These data
indicated that miR-451 repression might play critical roles
in radioresistance of docetaxel-resistant LAD cells.

Next, we focused on revealing the underlying
molecular mechanisms by which re-expression of miR451 reversed radioresistance of docetaxel-resistant LAD
cells. Apoptotic cell death has already been associated
with radioresistance of several tumor cells [18]. Flow
cytometry was performed to determine the effect of
miR-451 expression on irradiation-induced apoptosis in
docetaxel-resistant and parental LAD cells, and it was
observed that the apoptosis of miR-451-enforced H1299/
DTX or SPC-A1/DTX cells combined with irradiation
treatment (4.0 Gy) was significantly increased compared
with that in miR-NC-transfected cells combined with
irradiation treatment (Figure 2A). Likewise, when
combined with irradiation treatment (2.0Gy), the

apoptosis of Anti-miR-451-transfected parental H1299
or SPC-A1 cells was significantly decreased compared
with Anti-miR-NC-transfected cells (Supplementary
Figure 2A). Next, Western blot assay was performed to
detect the expression of total Caspase-3 (Caspase-3)
and Cleaved caspase-3 (C-caspase-3). Compared with
those cells transfected with miR-NC alone or combined
with irradiation treatment (4.0 Gy), the expression of
C-caspase-3 protein in miR-451-enforced H1299/DTX and
SPC-A1/DTX cells combined with irradiation treatment
was significantly increased, but the expression of total
caspase-3 protein showed no significant difference (Figure
2B). Meanwhile, compared with those cells transfected
with Anti-miR-NC alone or combined with irradiation
treatment (2.0 Gy), the expression of C-caspase-3 protein
in miR-451-downregulated H1299 and SPC-A1 cells
combined with irradiation treatment was significantly
decreased, but the expression of total Caspase-3 protein
showed no significant difference (Supplementary Figure
2B). Collectively, upregulation of miR-451 could lead to
the increased irradiation-induced apoptosis in docetaxelresistant LAD cells.
Phosphorylation of H2A.X (γ-H2A.X) foci
formation, a marker of DNA DSBs, has been implicated

in the process of DNA impairment induced by irradiation
[18]. To further study the effect of miR-451 on regulation
of irradiation-induced DNA DSBs, pcDNA/miR-451 or
pcDNA/miR-NC was stably transfected into docetaxelresistant LAD cells, and then the cells were treated with
irradiation treatment (4.0 Gy). Then, immunofluorescence
analysis of γ-H2A.X foci formation and Western blotting
analysis of γ-H2A.X protein expression were performed.
As shown in Figure 3A, when combined with irradiation
treatment (4.0 Gy), miR-451 overexpression significantly
increased γ-H2A.X foci formation compared with miRNC group, and Western blotting analysis indicated that
the expression level of γ-H2A.X protein was significantly
upregulated in pcDNA/miR-451-transfected cells
compared with in miR-NC-transfected group (Figure
3B). At the same time, when combined with irradiation
treatment (2.0 Gy), the expression level of γ-H2A.X
protein was significantly downregulated in Anti-miR451-transfected cells compared with that in Anti-miRNC-transfected group (Supplementary Figure 2C). Thus,
re-expression of miR-451 enhances irradiation-induced
apoptosis and DNA DSBs in docetaxel-resistant LAD
cells.

Re-expression of miR-451 significantly increases
in vivo radiosensitivity of docetaxel-resistant LAD
cells
To further investigate the effect of miR-451
expression on the in vivo radiosensitivity of LAD cells,
H1299/DTX cells stably transfected pcDNA/miR-451 or
pcDNA/miR-NC were subcutaneously inoculated into
nude mice. After formation of palpable tumors, irradiation
was performed and tumor volumes were measured.
As shown in Figure 4A, the average volume of tumors
developed from pcDNA/miR-451-transfected-H1299/
DTX cells was significantly smaller compared with that
developed from pcDNA/miR-NC-transfected cells, when
combined with irradiation treatment. The tumors of
H1299/DTX/miR-451 group grew more slowly than those
of H1299/DTX/miR-NC group, when combined with
irradiation treatment (Figure 4A). Then, immunostaining
assay showed that the PCNA-positive and Ki67-positive
cells in tumors derived from H1299/DTX/miR-451 group
were significantly reduced than those in tumors derived
from H1299/DTX/miR-NC group, when combined with
irradiation treatment (Figure 4B1-3). Also, TUNEL
staining assay indicated that the number of apoptotic
cells in tumors derived from H1299/DTX/miR-451 group
was significantly increased in comparison with those
derived from H1299/DTX/miR-NC one, when combined
with irradiation treatment (Figure 4C). Therefore, reexpression of miR-451 significantly increases the in vivo
radiosensitivity of docetaxel-resistant LAD cells.

Re-expression of miR-451 downregulates rad-51
and survivin expression by post-transcriptionally
downregulating c-Myc

protein in docetaxel-resistant and parental LAD cells,
and it was observed that c-Myc mRNA and protein was
significantly upregulated in docetaxel-resistant LAD cells
in comparison with the parental LAD cells (Figure 5A).
To further determine whether c-Myc was a direct target
of miR-451, we investigated the binding site of miR-451
in the 3’-UTR sequence of c-Myc mRNA (1891-1912
nt). We generated a luciferase reporter (pLUC/c-Myc/3’UTR-wt) in which the nucleotides of the c-Myc-3’UTR complementary to miR-451 were inserted into the
pLUC vector, and we also generated a mutant reporter
(pLUC/c-Myc/3’-UTR-mut). 48h after pcDNA/miR451 (or pcDNA/miR-NC) and pLUC/c-Myc/3’-UTRwt (or pLUC/c-Myc/3’-UTR-mut) were co-transfected
into HEK293T cells, and then the luciferase activity was
measured. The luciferase activity of the pLUC/c-Myc/3’UTR-wt-transfected cells co-transfected with pcDNA/
miR-451 was significantly decreased in comparison with
that of the pLUC/c-Myc/3’-UTR-wt-transfected cells cotransfected with pcDNA/miR-NC (Figure 5B), suggesting
that c-Myc might be a direct target of miR-451.
Recent studies have shown that rad-51 and survivin

Previously, we have shown that miR-451 functions
as a tumor suppressor in NSCLC by targeting ras-related
protein 14 (RAB14). Here, the expression of RAB14
protein showed no difference between in docetaxelresistant and parental LAD cells (data not shown). As
miRNA can interact with hundreds of genes and a gene
can be targeted by many miRNAs, miR-451 may play
critical roles in radioresistance of docetaxel-resistant
LAD cells by targeting other mRNAs. By performing a
computational screen for genes with complementary sites
of miR-451 in their 3’-UTR using open access softwares
(TargetScan, miRBase targets and PicTarget), c-Myc
might be a putative target of miR-451. The c-Myc protein,
a nuclear phosphprotein with DNA binding properties,
has a pivotal function in growth control, differentiation
and apoptosis. First, qRT-PCR and Western blotting was
performed to detect the expression of c-Myc mRNA and

both of which are reported to be firmly linked with
radioresistance of tumor cells can be transcriptionally
activated by c-Myc [19, 20]. Rad-51, an important
component of DNA homologous recombination system,
plays key roles in repairing DNA DSBs which are the
predominant lethal lesions induced by irradiation [21].
Survivin, a key regulator of apoptosis pathway, has
been reported to be associated with cell survival and
maintenance [22]. Here, qRT-PCR and Western blotting
assays indicated that the mRNA and protein expression
levels of rad-51 and survivin in SPC-A1/DTX and H1299/
DTX cells were significantly higher than those in parental
cells (Figure 5C). Then, we explored whether miR-451
was involved in the regulation of these radioresistance-

related genes. As shown in Figure 5D, the expression
levels of c-Myc, rad-51 and survivin both mRNA and
protein were significantly decreased in pcDNA/miR451-transfected SPC-A1/DTX or H1299/DTX cells in
comparison with pcDNA/miR-NC-transfected cells.
Also, the mRNA and protein expression levels of these
genes were significantly upregulated in Anti-miR-451transfected SPC-A1 or H1299 cells in comparison with
Anti-miR-NC-transfected cells (Figure 5E).
To further confirm that c-Myc is involved in the
regulation of rad-51 and survivin mediated by miR-451
in LAD cells, we first determine the effect of c-Myc
expression on the expression of those proteins. First, shc-Myc (#1, #2 or #3) and sh-control vectors were stably

transfected into SPC-A1/DTX or H1299/DTX cells,
respectively, and results indicated that the inhibitory effect
of sh-c-Myc#3 was the biggest (Supplementary Figure
3A-B). Silencing of c-Myc could lead to the decreased
expression of survivin and rad-51 mRNA and protein
in SPC-A1/DTX cells, while overexpression of c-Myc
could increase their expression in parental SPC-A1 cells
(Figure 6A-B). Then, the effects of miR-451/c-Myc on
the activity of survivin and rad-51 promoters were further
analyzed, and results showed that upregulation of miR451 and silencing of c-Myc could lead to the reduced
transcriptional activity of survivin and rad-51 promoters in
SPC-A1/DTX cells (Figure 6C). Likewise, downregulation
of miR-451 and upregulation of c-Myc could lead to the
increased transcriptional activity of survivin and rad-51
promoters in SPC-A1 cells (Figure 6D). Furthermore,
ChIP assays indicated that upregulation of miR-451 could
reduce the amount of c-Myc binding to the promoters
of survivin and rad-51 in vivo (Figure 6E1-2), while
silencing of c-Myc could also reduce the amount of c-Myc
binding to those promoters in vivo (Figure 6F1-2). Next,
we determine the activity of survivin or rad-51 promoter
reporters in pcDNA/miR-451-transfected SPC-A1/DTX
cells co-transfected with pcDNA/c-Myc, and showed

that overexpression of c-Myc could partially rescue
the decreased activity of survivin or rad-51 promoter
reporters induced by miR-451 upregulation (Figure 6G).
Importantly, upregulation of c-Myc could partially rescue
the decreased expression of survivin and rad-51 induced
by miR-451 upregulation, while silencing of c-Myc could
also partially rescue the increased expression of survivin
and rad-51 induced by miR-451 downregulation (Figure
6H). Thus, c-Myc, identified as a direct target of miR451, is responsible for regulation of rad-51 and survivin
in docetaxel-resistant LAD cells.

Silencing of c-Myc phenocopies the effect of miR451 on reversing the radioresistance of docetaxelresistant LAD cells both in vitro and in vivo
As the pro-oncogene c-Myc was identified
as a functional target of miR-451, we then focused
on understanding the effect of c-Myc expression on
radioresistance of docetaxel-resistant LAD cells. First,
the ED50 values of irradiation in docetaxel-resistant LAD
cells stably transfected with sh-control or sh-c-Myc#3
vector were determined by CCK-8 assay. As shown in

Figure 7: Silencing of c-Myc increases the sensitivity of docetaxel-resistant LAD cells to irradiation. (A) CCK-8 assay was

Figure 7A, the ED50 values of irradiation in shRNA-cMyc#3-transfected SPC-A1/DTX or H1299/DTX cells
were significantly reduced, compared with those in shcontrol-transfected cells (P<0.01). Also, silencing of
c-Myc could significantly reduce the colony formation
capacity of SPC-A1/DTX and H1299/DTX cells in the
presence of irradiation (Figure 7B). Furthermore, silencing
of c-Myc could also lead to the decreased expression of
rad-51 and survivin proteins in SPC-A1/DTX and H1299/
DTX cells (Figure 7C). Next, we explored whether
silencing of c-Myc could recapitulate the effect of miR451 upregulation on irradiation-induced apoptosis in
docetaxel-resistant LAD cells. When combined with
irradiation treatment (4.0Gy), the apoptotic rate of shc-Myc#3-transfected SPC-A1/DTX or H1299/DTX
cells was significantly increased compared with those
of sh-control-transfected cells (Supplementary Figure
4A). Then, Western blotting was performed to detect
the expression of cleaved or total caspase-3 proteins.
When combined with irradiation treatment (4.0Gy),
the expression level of cleaved caspase-3 protein in shc-Myc#3-transfected SPC-A1/DTX or H1299/DTX
cells was significantly increased in comparison with

sh-control-transfected cells, but the expression of total
caspase-3 protein showed no difference (Supplementary
Figure 4B). In addition, silencing of c-Myc combined
with irradiation treatment (4.0Gy) significantly increased
γ-H2A.X foci formation compared with control group
(Supplementary Figure 5A). The expression of γ-H2A.X
protein was upregulated in sh-c-Myc#3-transfected cells
compared with that in control group, when combined with
irradiation treatment (4.0Gy) (Supplementary Figure 5B).
Collectively, silencing of c-Myc mimics the effects of
miR-451 upregulation on enhancing irradiation-induced
apoptosis and DNA DSBs in docetaxel-resistant LAD
cells.

Overexpression of c-Myc rescues the effects
of enhanced miR-451 expression on on
radioresistance of docetaxel-resistant LAD cells
To further confirm that c-Myc was involved in
miR-451-mediated chemo- and radiotherapy cross
resistance in LAD cells, pcDNA/c-Myc or pcDNA/
control was transfected into docetaxel-resistant LAD

cells stably transfected with pcDNA/miR-451 or pcDNA/
miR-NC. 48 hours after transfection, it was observed
that pcDNA/c-Myc could partially rescue the decreased
ED50 values of irradiation in SPC-A1/DTX or H1299/
DTX cells induced by miR-451 upregulation (Figure 8A).
Also, upregulation of c-Myc could partially abrogate the
decreased colony-formation capacity of pcDNA/miR451-transfected SPC-A1/DTX or H1299/DTX cells with
irradiation treatment (4.0Gy) (Figure 8B). Furthermore,
we determine whether c-Myc overexpression could
rescue miR451-induced promotion of apoptosis and
DNA DSBs. Flow cytometry assay showed that c-Myc
overexpression could rescue the increased apoptosis of
pcDNA/miR-451-transfected SPC-A1/DTX or H1299/
DTX cells combined with irradiation treatment (4.0Gy)
(Figure 8C). Also, Western blotting assay further indicated
that overexpression of c-Myc could rescue the increased
expression of cleaved caspase-3 and γ-H2A.X proteins in
pcDNA/miR-451-transfected SPC-A1/DTX or H1299/
DTX cells combined with irradiation treatment (4.0Gy)
(Figure 8D). Additionally, immunofluorescence analysis
of γ-H2A.X foci formation also confirmed the results
of Western blotting assay (Figure 11E). Therefore,
overexpression of c-Myc partially rescues the effects of
miR-451 upregulation on radioresistance of docetaxelresistant LAD cells.

DISCUSSION
In the present study, for the first time, we showed
that downregulation of miR-451 was significantly
correlated with chemo- and radiotherapy cross resistance
in LAD cells. Re-expression of miR-451 could reverse
radioresistance of docetaxel-resistant LAD cells through
promoting apoptosis and DNA DSBs. The proto-oncogene
c-Myc was identified as a direct target of miR-451, and
re-expression of miR-451 significantly inhibited the
expression of survivin and rad-51 by reducing the amount
of c-Myc protein binding to the promoters of survivin and
rad-51. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report
about the involvement of miR-451/c-Myc-survivin/rad-51
signaling in chemo- and radiotherapy cross resistance of
LAD cells.
Chemoresistant tumors often fail to respond to other
cytotoxic treatments such as radiotherapy [22]. However,
the molecular mechanisms of chemo- and radiotherapy
cross resistance are not fully understood. Recent evidence
has shown that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play an
important role in tumor pathogenesis, and provide new
insights into the biology of chemo- and radiotherapy cross
resistance [23]. Over the past decade, miRNAs have moved
to the forefront of ncRNA research in human cancers.
MiRNAs, a class of small endogenous noncoding RNAs,
make up a novel class of gene regulators [24]. Increasing
evidence has firmly shown that miRNAs regulate a variety
of cellular processes such as differentiation, development,
proliferation and metabolism [25-28]. Recent evidence
indicates that the aberrant regulation of miRNAs plays an
important role in pathogenesis of lung cancer, including
chemo- or radioresistance [29, 30]. In previous study,
we have analyzed the miRNA expression profiles in
NSCLC by use of a miRNA microarray platform and
identified 40 differentially expressed miRNAs, and miR451 was found to be the most downregulated. Also, miR451 was found to be significantly correlated with tumor
differentiation, pathological stage, lymph node metastasis
and poor prognosis of patient, and further researches
indicated that miR-451 could inhibit growth and enhance
apoptosis of NSCLC cells by targeting RAB14 [15]. At
the same time, the tumor suppressor functions of miR-451
in other types of human malignancies are increasingly
reported. Godlewski’ et al identified a potential feedback
loop between LKB1 and miR-451, and showed that
microRNA-451 is a conditional switch controlling glioma
cell proliferation and migration [31]. Li and his colleagues
showed that miR-451 inhibits growth of human colorectal
carcinoma cells via downregulation of PI3k/Akt pathway
[32]. In another report, the over-expressed miR-451 in

c-Myc is inversely correlated with miR-451 and
positively correlated with rad-51 and survivin in
LAD tissues
qRT-PCR was performed to detect the mRNA
expression of miR-451, rad-51 and survivin in 32 paired
of LAD and corresponding nontumor tissues. In consensus
with our previous report [26], miR-451 was found to be
predominantly downregulated in LAD tissues, compared
with corresponding nontumor tissues (Supplementary
Figure 6A). Meanwhile, the expression mRNA levels of
c-Myc, rad-51 and survivin were significantly upregulated
in LAD tissues, compared with corresponding nontumor
tissues (Supplementary Figure 6B-D). In the same
LAD tissues, we then correlated miR-451 with the
mRNA expression levels of c-Myc, rad-51 and survivin.
Significant inverse correlations were observed when three
mRNA expression levels (c-Myc, rad-51 and survivin)
were plotted against miR-451 expression levels (2-tailed
Spearman’s correlation; miR-451/c-Myc: r = -0.754,
P<0.0001; miR-451/rad-51: r = -0.599, P<0.0001; miR451/survivin: r = -0.662, P<0.0001) (Supplementary
Figure 4E-G). In the same LAD tissues, we then
correlated c-Myc with the mRNA expression levels of
rad-51 and survivin. Significant positive correlations were
observed when two mRNA expression levels (rad-51 and
surviving) were plotted against c-Myc mRNA expression
levels (2-tailed Spearman’s correlation; c-Myc/rad-51:

colon cancer cells was found to inhibit AMPK to activate
mTORC1, which mediates FSCN1 expression and cancer
cell progression [33]. Meanwhile, miR-451 is reported
to be involved in the self-renewal, tumorigenicity, and
chemoresistance of colorectal cancer stem cells [34]. The
associations of miR-451 with chemo- or radiosensitivity
of tumor cells are also reported. Upregulation of miR-451
not only increases cisplatin sensitivity of non-small cell
lung cancer cell line, but also reverses the resistance of
the MCF-7 breast cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drug
doxorubicin [35, 36]. Interestingly, overexpression of
miR-451 in gastric and colorectal cancer cells reduced
cell proliferation and increased sensitivity to radiotherapy
by regulation of macrophage migration inhibitory factor
production [37]. However, whether miR-451 plays a
critical role in chemo- or radiotherapy cross resistance in
LAD cells is still unclear.
To further investigate the molecular mechanisms
of docetaxel resistance and provide therotical support
for drug resistant reversal induced by docetaxel, the
multidrug-resistant LAD cell lines (SPC-A1/DTX and
H1299/DTX) were previously established from human
LAD cell lines (SPC-A1 and H1299) in our lab by
stepwise selection using docetaxel as inducing reagent. It
was observed that docetaxel-resistant LAD cells not only
showed the increased chemoresistance but also was crossresistant to irradiation. Thus, establishment of docetaxelresistant LAD cell models will provide foundation for
further research on the molecular mechanisms involved
in the formation of radioresistance in chemoresistant

LAD cells. Here, miR-451 was found to be significantly
lower in docetaxel-resistant LAD cells, compared with
parental LAD cells. By gain- and loss-of-function assays,
upregulation of miR-451 significantly increases the
sensitivity of docetaxel-resistant LAD cells to irradiation
both in vitro and in vivo by enhancing DNA DSBs and
apoptosis. DNA DSBs have been regarded as the major
lethal lesions involved in irradiation-mediated cell deaths
[38]. Thus, the successful repair of DNA DSBs induced by
irradiation is critical for preserving genomic integrity and
maintenance of cell survival, and the defective DNA DSBs
repair of cancer cells can be exploited for cancer therapy
combined with irradiation [39]. However, irradiationmediated DNA DSBs can be efficiently repaired by
DNA homologous recombination which needs numerous
factors including the central recombinase rad-51 [40].
Recent studies have highlighted that silenced rad-51
is correlated with increased radiosensitivity of tumor
cells and targeting rad-51 will be a potential target for
combined therapies in clinic [41, 42]. Previously, aberrant
expression of miRNAs has been reported to be associated
with tumor radioresistance. For example, overexpressed
miR-155 could reduce the efficiency of DNA repair and
enhance radiosensitivity of breast cancer cells by directly
repressing RAD51 [43]. Upregulation of miR-449a
effectively increases irradiation-induced DNA damage
and apoptosis, and eventually enhances radiosensitivity of
CL1-0 LAD cells [44]. Here, we showed that upregulation
of miR-451 significantly decreased protein expression of
rad-51, which eventually led to the increased DNA DSBs
(formation of γ-H2A.X foci) in docetaxel-resistant LAD
cells. It is well established that inhibition of cell growth by
promoting apoptosis is one of the mechanisms responsible
for radiotherapy [45]. Survivin, a key regulator of
apoptosis pathway has been linked to increased tumor cell
survival potential by inhibiting apoptosis, and knockdown
of survivin enhances radiosensitivity of breast cancer cells
[46]. In this study, our data indicated that enforced miR451 expression significantly reduced survivin expression,
which led to the increased caspase-3-dependent apoptosis.
Therefore, re-expression of miR-451 enhances DNA DSBs
and apoptosis by downregulating rad-51 and survivin,
which finally leads to the reversal of radioresistance in
docetaxel-resistant LAD cells.
To further understand the molecular mechanisms
involved in regulation of rad-51 and survivin of docetaxelreistant LAD cells induced by miR-451, the determination
of its direct and functional target genes is needed. RAB14
belongs to the large RAB family of low molecular mass
GTPases that are involved in intracellular membrane
trafficking [47]. In our previous study, RAB14 has been
identified as a functional target of miR-451 in NSCLC,
but the expression of RAB14 showed no difference
between docetaxel-resistant and parental LAD cells
(data not shown). As one microRNA can regulate much
target mRNAs and one mRNA can also be regulated

MATERIALS AND METHODS

by much microRNAs. Thus, miR-451 might regulate
chemo- or radiotherapy cross resistance of LAD cells
by targeting other mRNAs. By using three algorithms,
c-Myc was predicated to a potential target of miR-451,
which was consistent with the previous study [48]. The
proto-oncogene c-Myc, a critical regulator of tumor
cell growth, apoptosis and DNA DSBs repair has been
associated with radioresistance of numerous tumors [49].
Overexpressed c-Myc leads to activation of the DNAdamage-checkpoint response and increased radioresistance
of the PKH26+ stem cell-like subpopulation from
nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and knockdown of c-Myc
significantly increases DNA DSBs induced by irradiation
in the PKH26+ stem cell-like cells [50]. In this study, we
showed that upregulation of miR-451 significantly reduced
the luciferase activity of the c-Myc-3’-UTR reporter and
decreased protein expression of c-Myc, suggesting that
c-Myc might be a conserved target gene of miR-451.
Recently, c-Myc has been reported to transcriptionally
activate rad-51 and survivin both of which are firmly
linked to radiosensitivity of tumor cells. Here, both reexpression of miR-451 and silencing of c-Myc could
significantly downregulate the expression of rad-51
and survivin by reducing the amount of c-Myc binding
to the promoters of survivin and rad-51. Furthermore,
silencing of c-Myc could phenocopy the effect of miR451 upregulation on the reversal of radioresistance in
docetaxel-resistant LAD cells by promoting apoptosis and
DNA DSBs. More importantly, overexpression of c-Myc
could partially rescue the effects of enhanced miR-451
on docetaxel-resistant LAD cells. Our data are supported
by clinical data where we found a statistically significant
inverse correlation between the expression of miR-451
and c-Myc, rad-51 or survivin in LAD tissue samples.
Therefore, dysregulation of miR-451/c-Myc-rad-51/
survivin signaling might be correlated with chemo- and
radiotherapy cross resistance of LAD cells.
In summary, our study showed mechanistically for
the first time how cellular miRNA regulates chemo- and
radiotherapy cross resistance in LAD cells. Present data
demonstrate that re-expression of miR-451 downregulates
the expression of rad-51 and survivin by targeting c-Myc,
which promotes DNA DSBs and induces apoptosis
enhancement, and eventually reverses radioresistance of
docetaxel-resistant LAD cells. Therefore, loss of miR451 during chemo- and radiotherapy cross resistance of
LAD cells is likely to lead mis-regulation of this network
(Figure 9). Thus, this newly identified miR-451/c-Mycrad-51/survivin signaling pathway provides novel insight
into the molecular mechanisms which regulate chemoand radiotherapy cross resistance, and further provides
a promising strategy for the treatment of chemoresistant
LAD in future.

Cell culture
The parental human LAD cell lines (SPC-A1 and
H1299) were obtained from the Cell Bank of Shanghai
institute of cell biology (Chinese Academy of Medical

In vivo radiotherapy assay and immunostaining
BALB/c athymic nude mice (Male, SPF, 5-6 weeks)
were provided by the department of comparative medicine
of Jinling hospital. The in-vivo study was ethically
approved and performed according to the institutional
guidelines. Approximately 3.0×106 SPC-A1/DTX/miRNC or SPC-A1/DTX/Let-7c cells were suspended in 100
μL PBS and injected subcutaneously into the right side of

B is the perpendicular diameter. When the average tumor
size reached about 50 mm3, the tumor-bearing nude mice
were exposed to X-ray of 2.0 Gy alone for each time.
The same treatment for each group were repeated 3 times
(the interval time was 5 days). After 6 weeks, all mice

to sample collection.

Luciferase reporter assay
Luciferase reporter containing wild type 3’UTR of c-Myc (pLUC/c-Myc/3’-UTR-wt) in which the
nucleotides of the c-Myc-3’-UTR complementary to
miR-451 were inserted into the pGL3-Basic vector, and
we also generated a mutant reporter (pluc/c-Myc/3’-UTRmut) from the wild type with point mutation. The primers
were presented in Supplementary Table 2. A total of
2.0×103/well SPC-A1/DTX cells were seeded into 96-well
plates and then co-transfected with the specific luciferase
reporter plasmids, pcDNA/miR-NC or pcDNA/miR-451.
Renila-TK plasmid (Promega, USA) was co-transfected
into all samples. 48 hours after transfection, luciferase
activities were measured with Dual-Luciferase Reporter
Assay kits (Promega, USA). The luciferase activities were
normalized by renilla luciferase activities. The data were
relative to the fold change of the corresponding control
groups that was defined as 1.0. All experiments were
performed in triplicate.

Statistical analysis
The data were the means ± standard error of at least
three independent experiments. The SPSS 17.0 software
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was applied for statistical
analysis. Multiple group comparisons were analyzed
with one-way ANOVA and two group comparisons were
performed with a Student t test. All tests performed
were two-sided. P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

ChIP
assay
was
performed
with
Immunoprecipitation Assay Kits (Millipore, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells
were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at
37°C. The cells were then resuspended in 200 μl of lysis
buffer and incubated for 10 minutes on ice. The lysate
was sheared to lengths between 200 and 1000 base pairs
by sonication. The supernatant was pre-cleared with a
Salmon Sperm DNA/Protein A Agarose-50% Slurry. The
recovered supernatant was incubated with anti-c-Myc
antibody (Abcam) or an isotype control IgG overnight at
4ºC with rotation. Then, the antibody/DNA complex was
collected using Salmon Sperm DNA/Protein A Agarose
Slurry for one hour at 4ºC with rotation. The complex
was eluted by elution buffer. Then, the crosslinks were
reversed with 5M NaCl heating at 65ºC for 4 hours. The
DNA sample was then purified and measured by qRTPCR. The primers were listed on Supplementary Table 3.
