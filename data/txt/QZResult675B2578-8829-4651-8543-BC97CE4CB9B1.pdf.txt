Abstract
Classification of liposarcoma into three biological types
encompassing five subtypes, (a) well-differentiated/dedifferentiated, (b) myxoid/round cell, and (c) pleomorphic, based on
morphologic features and cytogenetic aberrations, is widely
accepted. However, diagnostic discordance remains even
among expert sarcoma pathologists. We sought to develop a
more systematic approach to liposarcoma classification based
on gene expression analysis and to identify subtype-specific
differentially expressed genes that may be involved in liposarcoma genesis/progression and serve as potential therapeutic targets. A classifier based on gene expression profiling
was able to distinguish between liposarcoma subtypes, lipoma,
and normal fat samples. A 142-gene predictor of tissue class
was derived to automatically determine the class of an
independent validation set of lipomatous samples and shows
the feasibility of liposarcoma classification based entirely on
gene expression monitoring. Differentially expressed genes for
each liposarcoma subtype compared with normal fat were
used to identify histology-specific candidate genes with an indepth analysis of signaling pathways important to liposarcoma
pathogenesis and progression in the well-differentiated/
dedifferentiated subset. The activation of cell cycle and
checkpoint pathways in well-differentiated/dedifferentiated
liposarcoma provides several possible novel therapeutic strategies with MDM2 serving as a particularly promising target.
We show that Nutlin-3a, an antagonist of MDM2, preferentially
induces apoptosis and growth arrest in dedifferentiated liposarcoma cells compared with normal adipocytes. These results
support the development of a clinical trial with MDM2 antagonists for liposarcoma subtypes which overexpress MDM2
and show the promise of using this expression dataset for new
drug discovery in liposarcoma. [Cancer Res 2007;67(14):6626–36]

Introduction
Liposarcoma is the single most common soft tissue sarcoma and
accounts for at least 20% of all sarcomas in adults (1). Liposarcomas are a heterogeneous group of mesenchymal tumors that

may arise in any anatomic site. Surgery serves as the mainstay of
therapy for localized liposarcoma. However, for locally advanced
and disseminated disease there are few effective treatment options.
Insight into the genetic events that drive the biology of these
tumors may allow for molecular subtyping and the development of
novel selective therapeutic strategies for advanced disease. Subtype
is the most important determinant of clinical outcome (2–6);
however, little is known about the genetic events specific to
liposarcoma subtype. Widely used histopathologic and clinical
criteria, such as liposarcoma subtype, location, age, and size, can
be incorporated into liposarcoma-specific nomograms and used
to estimate patient outcome (7). However, even in using such tools,
a significant variability in predictive value exists among different
clinical laboratories and hospitals with regard to the assessment of
liposarcoma histologic subtype, which has been primarily based on
morphologic appearance of the tumor.
Liposarcomas with similar morphologic appearance can follow
different clinical courses and show divergent responses to systemic
therapy. A correct histologic categorization is important because
patients with pleomorphic liposarcoma have a 3-fold higher risk of
distant metastasis compared with patients with dedifferentiated
liposarcoma and are more likely to respond to treatment with
systemic ifosfamide-based chemotherapy (8). However, the accurate
discrimination of pleomorphic from dedifferentiated liposarcoma
based on morphology alone is often a challenge even for an
experienced soft tissue pathologist. Transcriptional profiling is a
powerful tool for analyzing the relationships between tumors,
discovering new tumor subgroups, assigning tumors to predefined
classes, and predicting disease outcome. For this reason, we decided
to develop a more systematic approach to the classification of
liposarcoma based on gene expression analysis using microarrays.
Previous sarcoma gene expression profiling studies have shown
that liposarcomas tended to cluster with malignant fibrous histiocytoma and leiomyosarcoma. However, these studies contained too
few samples of any given liposarcoma subtype to draw clear
distinctions specific to subtype (9, 10). A liposarcoma specific RNA
expression profiling study compared eight pleomorphic liposarcomas to eight dedifferentiated liposarcomas and found no correlation
between expression data and histologic subtype (11). In contrast,
Matrix-CGH analysis provided unequivocal separation of dedifferentiated and pleomorphic subtypes, concluding that genomic
profiling might be more advantageous than RNA expression analysis
for subtype classification. Another liposarcoma-specific microarray
study of 28 liposarcomas (11 well differentiated, 3 dedifferentiated,
7 myxoid, 7 round cell) and eight lipomas found by hierarchical
clustering analysis that the dedifferentiated tumors formed a cluster

with the myxoid/round cell subtype and that the well-differentiated
liposarcomas clustered with lipoma (12). In this study, they were
unable to distinguish well-differentiated liposarcoma from lipoma
based on gene expression profiles, and the incorrect grouping of
dedifferentiated samples with myxoid/round cell tumors was most
likely due to the limited sample numbers analyzed in this study. One
of the major limitations of these liposarcoma array studies was the
very limited sample number per subtype, and the fact that the same
data set was used for both signature discovery and validation.
Here, we applied a microarray-based gene expression profiling
approach to identify molecular signatures that distinguish liposarcoma subtype and developed a support vector machine (SVM)
classifier demonstrating high discrimination accuracy between
subtypes of liposarcoma, using a training set of 80 samples, and
then validated this classifier on an independent test set of 49
lipomatous tissue samples. Differentially expressed genes for each
liposarcoma subtype compared with normal fat were used to
identify histology-specific signaling pathways and candidate genes
important to liposarcoma pathogenesis and progression. We found
significant activation of cell cycle and checkpoint pathways in welldifferentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma subtypes compared
with normal fat and postulated that several of these differentially
expressed genes may serve as potential therapeutic targets. We
then validated a particularly promising target, MDM2, and showed
that Nutlin-3a, an MDM2 antagonist, induced substantial apoptosis
and inhibited proliferation in dedifferentiated liposarcoma cell
lines but showed no effects in human adipocyte cell lines. These
data supports the clinical development of MDM2 antagonists for
treatment of patients with well-differentiated/dedifferentiated
liposarcoma.

Materials and Methods
Patient population and sample acquisition. Sequential patients seen
at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center between February 2002 and
September 2005 for treatment of liposarcoma were evaluated for this study.
Informed consent was obtained, and the project was approved by the local
institutional review board (IRB protocol 02-060). Liposarcomas consist
three biological types encompassing the five subtypes (well differentiated,
dedifferentiated, myxoid, round cell, and pleomorphic). Lipomas and
normal fat tissue were obtained at the time of surgical resection. Before
RNA extraction, two 5-Am H&E histologic sections were cut from the top
and bottom of the cryomold to assess for subtype, percentage of necrosis,
cellularity, and normal/stromal tissue contamination. Regions chosen for
analysis contained tumor cellularity of >75%, no mixed histology, and no
area of necrosis or fibrosis.
RNA isolation and preparation for microarray analysis. A cryomold
(0.5 cm  1 cm  1 cm), once typed for histology and macrodissected to
assure subtype uniformity and to eliminate necrotic/normal tissue
contamination, was used for RNA extraction and subsequent array analysis.
Cryomold tumor samples were weighed and 1 mL of QIAzol lysis reagent
was used for every 100 mg of tissue. The cryomold tissue specimens were
then homogenized in QIAzol lysis reagent using Mixer Mill MM 300 (Retsch,
Inc.) following standard procedures. After alcohol washing, the RNA sample
was purified and eluted using the RNeasy Mini Spin Column from the
RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini kit (QIAGEN, Inc.). cDNA was synthesized in the
presence of oligo(dT)24-T7 from Genset Corp. cRNA was prepared using
biotinylated UTP and CTP and hybridized to HG U113A oligonucleotide
arrays (Affymetrix, Inc.). Fluorescence was measured by laser confocal
scanner (Agilent) and converted to signal intensity by means of Affymetrix
Microarray Suite v5 software. The gene expression data are available at
www.cbio.mskcc.org/Public/Liposarcoma.

linkage was used to investigate whether there was evidence for natural
groupings of samples based on correlations between gene expression
profiles. To assess the robustness, a parametric bootstrap resampling
technique was used in which 1,000 bootstrap replicas for the original
dataset were generated and clustered. A consensus tree was built from these
1000 bootstrap trees; the number at each node in the consensus tree
indicates how many of the bootstrap trees had that subcluster. We then
used the SVM supervised learning algorithm to classify the liposarcoma and
normal fat samples. The SVM method computes the hyperplane that best
discriminates between two groups by maximizing the distance to the
closest points (margins). To make distinctions between these six tissue
types, the classification problem is divided into a series of all 15 possible
pair-wise comparisons. Each test sample is presented sequentially to these
15 pair-wise classifiers, which classify the sample into one of the pairs. A
voting procedure is then used to determine into which group the sample
belongs. We then evaluated the accuracy of this multiclass SVM-based
classifier for liposarcoma subtype and normal fat diagnosis using a set of 69
liposarcomas and nine normal fat samples. To determine the optimal
settings over the various variables, such as the number of genes ( features)
to use and the penalty cost function value, we use the cross-validation
method. The idea is to divide the data into a training set and a test set. In
our case, we used 10-fold cross validation, so the data was divided into a
training set of 90% of the samples and at test set of 10%. This division is
done randomly each time. We can then measure the performance for a
given set of variable values by training on the training set and scoring on
the test set. For the specific case of choosing the optimal number of genes
to use, we ranked all the genes by their absolute t score and then tested
models with varying numbers of genes from 1 to N (where N was roughly
100). Performance in the cross validation seemed to level off at about
15 genes per pair-wise classifier. The optimal SVM-based classifier was then
tested on an independent blind test set of 49 lipomatous tissue specimens,
consisting of 14 well differentiated, 13 dedifferentiated, 5 myxoid, 3 round
cell, 6 pleomorphic liposarcoma, and 8 normal fat tissue samples.
Identification of therapeutic targets. The gene expression profiles
from 10 patients with pure well-differentiated liposarcoma (no known
dedifferentiated component), 10 patients with dedifferentiated liposarcoma,
10 patients with pure myxoid liposarcoma (no known round cell
component), 10 patients with round cell liposarcoma, and 10 patients with
pleomorphic liposarcoma were separately compared with the gene profiles
from 10 patients with normal fat tissue. A gene discrimination analysis was
done using a standard t test on the log of the expression signal. Genes were
filtered by significance and on the fold change between the liposarcoma
subtype and normal fat. To deal with the multiple testing problem, we used
the false discovery rate (FDR) method to obtain corrected P values. Because
the different comparison pairs gave vastly different significant levels, we
picked cutoff values in the FDR for each comparison. In all cases, the cutoff
was either 0.05 or smaller for the more significant comparisons. From each
subtype-specific gene list, we selected potential therapeutic molecular
targets that showed at least a 2-fold differential expression compared with
normal fat. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis application,6 a web-based
bioinformatic tool that maps gene lists (ranked by FDR or fold change) to a
database of fully annotated biological interactions between genes displayed
in a graphical format, was used to determine the significant gene
interaction networks based on liposarcoma expression profiles. The most
promising target genes in this pathway analysis were validated with
quantitative reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR).
Expression quantification using real-time RT-PCR. This was done
using the remaining RNA available after U133A chip hybridization.
Extracted RNA was transcribed into cDNA using TaqMan RT reagents.
One-step RT-PCR performs RT and PCR in a single-buffer system. Real-time
analysis was used to quantitate gene expression. To compensate for
potential degradation of target RNA and differences in the amount of
starting material, real-time analysis was done in parallel on cDNA from each

sample using rRNA as an endogenous control. The copy numbers obtained
for the gene under study were divided by the corresponding copy numbers
for the rRNA control to yield a normalized expression index. Real-time
PCR was carried out according to the manufacturers’ instructions, using an
Applied Biosystems Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied
Biosystems). All primers/probes were designed using ABI Prism Primer
Express 1.5 software (Applied Biosystems) with the probes spanning exonic
junctions.
Cell culture and drug treatments. LS141 and DDLS cell lines were
established from human dedifferentiated liposarcoma tissue samples. The
normal human adipocyte (NADIP) cell line was established in culture from
human s.c. fat tissue. Cells were grown in RPMI 1640, supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL
streptomycin and maintained at 37jC in 5% CO2. The selective smallmolecule antagonist of MDM2 nutlin-3a (13) was prepared as a 10 mmol/L
stock solution in DMSO and stored at 20jC.
Proliferation assays. To evaluate the antiproliferative effect of nutlin
exposure on LS141, DDLS, and NADIP cells, DNA content was estimated
using the CyQuant Cell Proliferation kit (Molecular Probes). In brief, cells
were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 2  104 cells per well and
allowed to adhere overnight at 37jC. After treatment, cells were incubated
with CyQuant dye and lysed. This dye exhibits strong fluorescence when
bound to cellular nucleic acids, and, as such, the fluorescent signal is
proportional to DNA content. Plates were read using the Spectramax M2
fluorescence microplate reader (Molecular Devices) at 480/520 nm
excitation/emission.
Apoptosis assays. Evaluation of apoptosis was carried out using the
Guava NexinTM kit (Guava Technologies) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, cells were treated in duplicate 60-mm culture plates.
Both adherent and floating cells were collected and washed once in cold
PBS and once in 1 Annexin V binding buffer. Cells were then resuspended
at a concentration of 1  106 cells/mL. Annexin V (5 AL) and 7-AAD (2.5 AL)
were added to 50 AL of the cell suspension and allowed to incubate on ice
for 30 min in the dark. The Annexin V–positive population was counted
using the Guava perchloric acid (Guava Technologies), and data were
analyzed using FloJo software (Tree Star, Inc.).
Immunoblotting. Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay
buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Complete
Mini, Roche Diagnostics) and 1 mmol/L NaVO3. Total protein concentration
of the lysates was measured by Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories), and equal amounts of protein were loaded on 4% to 12% PAGE gels
(Invitrogen). Membranes were blotted with antibodies specific for MDM2,
p53, and p21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The equal loading of protein
was confirmed by Amido Black staining (Sigma Chemical) and Western
blotting for a-tubulin (Upstate Biotechnology).

Results
Microarrays of liposarcoma group in distinct genomic
clusters according to type and subtype. Here, we used microarrays to explore systematically the molecular variation underlying
the biological and clinical heterogeneity in liposarcoma. Using
Affymetrix U133A GeneChip arrays, we generated gene expression
profiles for 69 liposarcomas, 7 lipomas, and 9 normal fat tissue
specimens. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was used to allow
the dominant structure to dictate the separation of samples into
clusters based on overall similarity in gene expression without
prior knowledge of the sample identity (Fig. 1). This unsupervised
clustering approach shows that the normal fat, lipoma, and
liposarcoma subtypes form relatively discrete clusters. Three
distinct global clusters were observed: (a) normal fat, lipoma,
and well-differentiated liposarcoma; (b) dedifferentiated and
pleomorphic liposarcoma; and (c) myxoid/round cell liposarcoma.
Within the first cluster, lipomas form a distinct group from normal
fat and well-differentiated liposarcoma. In this first global cluster,
two well-differentiated liposarcoma clustered with the normal fat
samples. For the second global cluster, most of the pleomorphic
liposarcomas form a distinct subcluster from the dedifferentiated
subtype. However, four dedifferentiated samples cluster with the
pleomorphic samples and three well-differentiated samples cluster
with dedifferentiated liposarcoma samples. In the third global
cluster, two distinct subclusters are formed, one containing five
myxoid and four round cell samples and the other subcluster
containing 14 myxoid and five round cell liposarcoma samples.
Generation and validation of a SVM-based method for
classification of liposarcoma and normal fat samples. We then
used the supervised learning SVM algorithm to build a classifier
to determine the subtype of liposarcoma cases and to show the
feasibility of liposarcoma classification based entirely on gene
expression measurements. A 10-fold cross-validation method was
used to both test the performance and to determine the optimal
number of genes to use. With 15 genes per pair-wise classifier ( for a
total of 142 genes), we were able to determine subtype with an
accuracy of 90.8 F 0.2% (see Supplementary Table S1 for 142 gene
classifier). We then used this set of genes and validated the results
on an independent test set of 49 lipomatous tissue specimens,
consisting of 14 well differentiated, 13 dedifferentiated, 5 myxoid,
3 round cell, 6 pleomorphic liposarcoma, and 8 normal fat tissue

Figure 1. Hierarchical clustering of the liposarcoma, lipoma, and normal fat tissue expression data set. Before clustering, the data was filtered to remove genes
that were scored absent in >75% of the samples, leaving 13,341 of the original 22,215 probe sets. Standard hierarchical clustering was done using the Pearson
correlation to define the distance and ward linkage for the clustering. To assess the robustness, a parametric bootstrap resampling technique was used. The number at
each node indicates how many of the bootstrap trees had that subcluster. Liposarcoma subtypes include well-differentiated (WD ), dedifferentiated (DediffLS ),
myxoid (MLS ), round cell (RC ), and pleomorphic (PL).

samples. This SVM classifier predicted the correct overall biological
type of lipomatous tissue (normal fat versus well differentiated/
dedifferentiated versus myxoid/round cell versus pleomorphic) for
45 of 49 samples (92%) and correctly identified the correct tissue
subtype in 43 of 49 samples (86%). The misclassified biological types
included one pleomorphic liposarcoma sample from the thigh that
was misclassified as dedifferentiated liposarcoma, one dedifferentiated liposarcoma from the pelvis with 20% necrosis that was
misclassified as pleomorphic and two well-differentiated liposarcomas one from the thigh and the other from the ankle that were
misclassified as normal fat. The misclassified subtypes included one
myxoid liposarcoma with increased cellularity that was misclassified
as round cell, one retroperitoneal dedifferentiated liposarcoma
sample misclassified as a well-differentiated liposarcoma, and one
retroperitoneal well-differentiated liposarcoma with extensive myxoid change misclassified as a dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Subtype

enhanced sensitivity of the gene expression analysis for progression
of liposarcoma to a more aggressive, higher-grade subtype.
The list of the 15 most informative genes in the pleomorphic
versus dedifferentiated liposarcoma SVM class predictor (see Supplementary Table S1, DD versus PL) was highly instructive with 12
genes located on the amplified chromosome 12 subregion 12q13q15 commonly found in the large ring or marker chromosomes
associated with dedifferentiated liposarcoma. The overexpressed
genes in this subregion serve as the major feature used to discriminate these subtypes. The 80 genes significantly differentially
expressed greater than 2-fold when comparing dedifferentiated with
pleomorphic liposarcoma as shown in Fig. 2. Many of these
differentially expressed genes encode proteins critical for controlling the G1-S transition (CDK4, MDM2, cyclin D1, cyclin D2, CCT2,
GSPT1, CKS2, CKS1B), regulation of G2-M phase of cell cycle (KPNA2,
TUSC4), growth factor receptors (FRS2, NTRK3), regulation of

distinction relate to the control of lipid, fatty acid, and carbohydrate

differential expression of key cell cycle, transcription factor genes,
cytoskeleton/microtubule assembly, and apoptotic control genes.
Together, these data suggest that genes useful for liposarcoma class
prediction may also provide insight into liposarcoma pathogenesis
and progression from low-grade to high-grade liposarcoma.
Results showing significant up-regulated genes in each
liposarcoma subtype compared with normal fat. The genes
differentially expressed for each liposarcoma subtype compared
with normal fat can be used to identify candidate genes in
liposarcoma differentiation and tumorigenesis and to identify new
therapeutic molecular targets. Table 1A and B and Supplementary
Tables S2 to S4 shows the significant up-regulated genes for each
liposarcoma subtype compared with normal fat by comparing the
mean log expression levels in each liposarcoma subtype samples
with the normal fat tissue samples. To limit this gene list and to
avoid multiple testing problem, we applied a stringent FDR for
each subtype comparison and only examined genes that were
differentially expressed more than 2-fold compared with normal fat.

application,6 a web-based bioinformatic tool that maps gene lists
(ranked by FDR or fold change) to a database of fully annotated
biological interactions between genes displayed in a graphical
format, was used to determine the significant gene interaction
networks based on liposarcoma expression profiles. Comparison of
gene expression in well-differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma,
myxoid/round cell liposarcoma, and pleomorphic liposarcoma
with normal fat results in 998, 449, and 201 genes, respectively,
that were differentially expressed more than 2-fold. These 998 genes
for the well-differentiated/dedifferentiated type were entered into
the ingenuity pathway analysis, resulting in 364 ‘‘focus genes’’ based
on sufficient annotation of biological interactions. This final gene
list resulted in 15 high-scoring interaction networks. Given the
space limitations, we will present data from one of the most
informative interaction networks in the well-differentiated/dedifferentiated subtype. Although there were several additional
informative networks for all the biological types of liposarcoma,
these will be developed in future publications. One of the most
informative networks in this analysis contained a maximum of
35 genes, scored highly relative to other networks, and drew
attention to several cell cycle and checkpoint genes, the majority of
which are significantly over expressed in well-differentiated/
dedifferentiated liposarcoma compared with normal fat (see
Fig. 3A). CDK4, MDM2, CDC2, CDC7, cyclin B1 (CCNB1), cyclinB2
(CCNB2), cyclin E2 (CCNE2), and key regulators of the cell cycle
were significantly overexpressed in well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma compared with normal fat and account
for the high cellular proliferation found in these liposarcoma
subtypes. Figure 3B depicts the differentially expressed genes in cell
cycle regulation pathways specific to phases of the cell cycle in
well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma.
MDM2 as therapeutic target in well-differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma. For these studies, we treated the two
dedifferentiated liposarcoma cell lines with amplified MDM2
(LS141 and DDLS) and a NADIP cell line, which does not have
amplified MDM2 with nutlin (5 Amol/L) for 1 to 5 days and cell
viability was measured (Fig. 4A). As indicated, both of the
dedifferentiated liposarcoma cell lines were highly sensitive to

nutlin whereas the NADIP cells remained resistant to the drug. The
mechanism of decreased cell growth seems to be in part mediated
by an induction of apoptosis as indicated by Annexin V labeling
(Fig. 4B) and a G2 cell cycle arrest (Fig. 4C). Although both cell lines
are sensitive to the drug, this effect was greatest for the LS141 cell
line with 48 h of drug exposure and only 5 Amol/L of nutlin. This
increase in apoptosis in the LS141 cells can explain its increased
sensitivity to single-agent drug therapy even among dedifferentiated liposarcoma cell lines.
We next elected to examine changes in MDM2, p53, and p21
expression in the three cell lines. For these studies the cell lines
were treated with 2.5 to 10 Amol/L of nutlin for 24 h and then
examined for changes in these molecular events. As shown in
Fig. 5, nutlin induces p53 in both the LS141 and the DDLS cell lines.
The interruption of the MDM2-p53 interaction also results in a
significant increase in MDM2 by an established autoregulatory
feedback loop (13, 14). This effect was greatest for the LS141 cell
line and may be explained by the presence of a common
polymorphism in codon 72 of p53 for LS141, which was not
found in DDLS. This polymorphism has been associated with
more efficient transcription of p53 and p21 (15) and may explain
the increased sensitivity of LS141 cells to nutlin compared
with the DDLS cell line. The increase in p53 induces p21 in
the liposarcoma cell lines at nutlin concentrations as low as
2.5 Amol/L. In LS141 and DDLS cell lines, a nutlin concentration
of 5 Amol/L activates the p53-p21 axis, resulting in a G2 cell
cycle arrest (Fig. 4C). In contrast, in the NADIP cells, in which
MDM2 is not amplified and p53 is functional, 5 Amol/L nutlin
do not result in increased expression of MDM2, p53, or p21 and
there is no change in cell cycle or apoptosis. In the NADIP cells,
increased expression of p53 is only seen at high nutlin concentrations (10 Amol/L) with minimal induction of p21. In summary,
nutlin-3a, a small molecular antagonist of MDM2, preferentially
activates the p53 pathway in dedifferentiated liposarcoma cell lines
compared with NADIP cells, leading to a G2 cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis in liposarcoma cells. These results suggest that liposarcoma cells with MDM2 overexpression retain critical functionality in downstream p53-dependent apoptotic signaling pathways
and that the growth suppressive effects of the p53 pathway is
well preserved in liposarcoma and, in fact, substantially more
pronounced than NADIPs in response to MDM2 antagonists.

Discussion
Mortality rates for patients with liposarcoma are highly
heterogeneous and are largely dependent on the histologic subtype,
location, tumor burden, and patient age (6, 7). Histologic subtype
based on the morphologic appearance of the tumor is the most
important prognostic factor for survival, yet prior studies have
shown a high level of disagreement (25–40%) even among expert
pathologists for histologic type (16, 17) and emphasize the need
to develop new objective methods of liposarcoma classification.
High-throughput transcriptional profiling using DNA microarrays
provides tools to tackle this heterogeneity. Genome-wide expression studies of various cancers have identified subtypes of tumors
previously unrecognized but biologically and clinically relevant
with respect to morphologic features and prognosis (9, 10, 18–20).
This is important because molecular distinct tumor subtypes
represent different diseases that ideally would require different
treatments. Most recently, particular subtypes of liposarcoma have
been found to be associated with specific chromosomal trans-

www.aacrjournals.org

locations and specific cytogenetic abnormalities (21–23) and have
been used to improve the accuracy of subtype classification when
combined with morphology. However, cytogenetic analysis is labor
intensive and remains difficult to uniformly apply to all samples
because some subtypes do not grow well in short-term culture.
Immunohistochemical analysis of MDM2 and CDK4 protein
expression may help to discriminate benign lipomas characterized
by 12q13-15 rearrangements from well-differentiated liposarcoma/
atypical lipomatous tumors characterized by 12q13-15 amplification with overrepresentation of the CDK4 and MDM2 genes
(24, 25). A recent study has shown that MDM2 and CDK4
immunoexpressions correlate closely with the gene amplification
status in soft tissue tumors and show the utility of MDM2 and CDK4
immunostaining as helpful adjuncts to distinguish well-differentiated liposarcoma from benign adipose tumors and dedifferentiated
liposarcoma from poorly differentiated sarcomas (26). However,
amplification and overexpression of CDK4, MDM2, GLI, and
SAS genes of the 12q13-15 region has been detected in 45% of
leiomyosarcoma and 54% of rhabdomyosarcoma (27, 28) and has
also been detected frequently in human parosteal osteosarcomas
(29) and in 10% of Ewing’s sarcoma (30). This suggests that the
molecular deregulation of CDK4 and MDM2 is not specific for
the well-differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma subtypes.
To further improve subtype classification, we sought to develop a
classifier based on gene expression monitoring to automatically
discover the distinction between liposarcoma subtypes and normal
fat samples. In this analysis we examine all three biological groups of
liposarcoma, as well as lipoma and normal fat. Using an unsupervised
hierarchical clustering of gene expression profiles, three main
clusters are found that show significant differences with respect to
both tumor differentiation and subtype. These results suggest that
lipomatous tissues with similar histologic features of differentiation
show similarities in gene expression. A 142-gene multiclass SVMbased classifier using 15 genes per pair-wise classifier was able to
determine subtype with over 90% accuracy, and on an independent
test set subtype was 86% of samples correctly. The high performance
of this SVM-based classifier shows the promise of using a relatively
small subset of genes to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of
liposarcoma subtype based entirely on morphologic features.
Activation of cell cycle and checkpoint pathways in welldifferentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma. The cyclin-CDK
complexes serve as important regulators of key cell cycle transitions.
The cyclin D–CDK4/6 for G1 progression (31), cyclin E–CDK2 for
G1-S transition, cyclin A–CDK2 for S-phase progression (32), and
cyclin A/B–CDC2 (CDK1) for entry into M phase (33). Figure 3B
shows the interplay of key genes for regulating the stages of the cell
cycle and how the measured alterations in key gene expression levels
in the various phases of the cell cycle pathway can lead to
uncontrolled growth and contribute to liposarcoma formation. The
increased expression of the G1-S phase regulators CDK4 and cyclin E
would serve to enhance the G1-S transition. The universal CDI
inhibitor Kip2 (p57, CDKN1C), which inhibits all of the G1 kinases
(CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6), is 5-fold reduced in dedifferentiated
liposarcoma compared with normal fat. The decrease in p57 levels
with progression from well-differentiated to dedifferentiated liposarcoma may account for the increase in cellular proliferation
usually associated with dedifferentiated liposarcoma and may
further enhance G1-S transition in this subtype (34).
An important regulator of the G2-M checkpoint, CDC2, is
significantly overexpressed in all liposarcoma subtypes compared
with normal fat based on microarray analysis (Table 1A and B;

Supplementary Tables S2–S4) and RT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S2).
As well-differentiated liposarcoma progresses to dedifferentiated
liposarcoma, in addition to the substantial f4-fold further
increase in CDC2 expression, there is a 3-fold increase in cyclin
B1 and 4-fold increase in cyclin B2 expression compared with
normal fat. However, additional factors besides cyclin B transcription rate are involved in regulating mitosis from G2. In early G2,
inhibitory phosphorylation of CDC2 by wee1 is counteracted by
the CDC25 phosphatase (35). CDC25B is 3-fold overexpressed in
dedifferentiated liposarcoma compared with normal fat. CDC25 is
phosphorylated and activated by cyclin B/CDC2 complexes. Studies
using recombinant proteins suggest that a positive feed-back loop
between CDC2 and CDC25 is necessary for the full activation of
cyclin B/CDC2 that induces abrupt entry into mitosis in vivo (36).
Several of these differentially expressed cell cycle control genes
serve as potential therapeutic targets in liposarcoma which are
subtype specific. Based on the high-expression levels of CDK4, cyclin
E2, cyclin B1, cyclin B2, and CDC2 in well-differentiated and
dedifferentiated liposarcoma compared with normal fat, one would
predict that flavopiridol, a pan cyclin–dependent kinase inhibitor,
which has been shown to bind to and directly inhibit cyclin B1–CDC2
kinase, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 should show increased antitumor
activity in these liposarcoma subtypes. We are now evaluating in
preclinical studies the activity of flavopiridol compounds in welldifferentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma cell lines.
The mitotic checkpoint protein MAD2 was found to be 6-fold,
10-fold, and 13-fold overexpressed in dedifferentiated, round cell,
and pleomorphic liposarcoma, respectively, compared with normal
fat (validated by real-time RT-PCR; see Supplementary Fig. S2). The
low-grade liposarcoma subtypes, well differentiated and myxoid,
were found to not overexpress MAD2. MAD2 is a direct target of
E2F and is aberrantly expressed in cells with defects in the Rb
pathway (37, 38). Aberrant MAD2 expression has been associated
with checkpoint defects leading to aneuploidy. The spindle
checkpoint serves to maintain genomic stability by preventing
the onset of anaphase until all chromosomes are properly attached
to the mitotic spindle. The MAD2 checkpoint protein is a key
component of this checkpoint system because it inhibits the
anaphase-promoting complex and its coactivator CDC20. Spindle
damaging agents, such as paclitaxel (Taxol), stabilize microtubules,
inducing a mitotic arrest and activating the spindle cell checkpoint
before the subsequent sub-G1 apoptosis (39). Recent work suggests
that overexpression of MAD2 protein in checkpoint-defective
cells enhances paclitaxel sensitivity (40, 41). We plan further

www.aacrjournals.org

studies to test the spindle checkpoint response in dedifferentiated
liposarcoma cell lines so as to develop a strategy for fostering
enhanced apoptosis after treatment with microtubule inhibitors,
such as paclitaxel. Previous work has shown that flavopiridol
enhances paclitaxel-induced apoptosis only when given after
paclitaxel treatment (42). The elevated levels of MAD2 in
dedifferentiated, round cell, and pleomorphic liposarcoma may
make these subtypes sensitive to paclitaxel therapy, either alone
or in combination with flavopiridol.
MDM2 as a therapeutic target in liposarcoma subtypes that
overexpress MDM2. In this study, we have shown that MDM2 is
overexpressed in well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma compared with normal fat tissue and in dedifferentiated
liposarcoma cell lines compared with normal human preadipocyte
cells. Overproduction of MDM2 not only down-modulates p53
stability and function, inhibiting wild-type p53–mediated apoptosis,
but also interacts physically and functionally with pRb and inhibits
pRb growth regulatory function (43), leading to loss of the two main
inhibitory systems of cell proliferation that act at the G1-S and G2-M
checkpoints (see Fig. 3B). MDM2 facilitates the shift into S phase by
activating E2F-1 (44). Activation of E2F-1 triggers dissociation of
E2F-1–pRb complexes, which removes the block from G1-S phase.
Thus, amplification of MDM2 in well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma can function both to induce cell proliferation
and enhance cell survival. Because p53 mutations are relatively
infrequent in liposarcoma subtypes with amplified MDM2 (45, 46), we
postulated that selective activation of p53 might offer an alternative
therapeutic strategy for these liposarcoma subtypes, which are largely
resistant to conventional chemotherapy. However, it is not known
if p53-dependent apoptotic signaling is functionally intact in
dedifferentiated liposarcoma cells and if this effect could be used
to preferentially induce cell death in liposarcoma cells compared
with NADIP cells. In this study, we report on the first molecular
and functional analysis of the p53 pathway in dedifferentiated
liposarcoma and NADIP cell lines using the recently developed
MDM2 antagonist, nutlin-3a, as a specific p53 inducer (13).
Treatment of dedifferentiated liposarcoma cells with nutlin-3a at
concentrations as low as 2.5 Amol/L results in increased levels of
p53 protein and its downstream transcriptional targets MDM2
and p21. Nutlin-3a treatment of two dedifferentiated liposarcoma
cell lines resulted in significant induction of apoptosis and
inhibition of proliferation associated with a G2 cell cycle arrest.
In contrast, NADIP cells following treatment with 2.5 to 5 Amol/L
concentrations of nutlin-3a showed no apoptosis, cell cycle, or
proliferative changes. For the normal adipocyte cells, induction of
p53, p21, and MDM2 was seen only following treatment with high
(10 Amol/L) concentrations of nutlin-3a. Thus, downstream p53
pathway signaling in dedifferentiated liposarcoma cell lines with
overexpressed MDM2 seems to be much more pronounced than
normal adipocyte cells and suggests that MDM2 antagonists, such
as nutlin-3a, might serve as an effective therapeutics for liposarcomas with MDM2 amplification and at the same time induce
few antiproliferative or apoptotic effects on normal cells.
In summary, we have shown the utility of gene expression
analysis for the diagnosis of liposarcoma subtype and how
differential gene expression between liposarcoma tissue types
and normal fat can be combined with bioinformatic pathway
analysis to prioritize genes as potential therapeutic targets.
Activation of cell cycle and checkpoint pathways in welldifferentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma combined with
MDM2 overexpression in these subtypes identified MDM2 as a

promising drug target. A highly specific MDM2 antagonist, nutlin3a, results in substantial apoptosis in dedifferentiated liposarcoma
cell lines that were not found in NADIP cells. These results further
support the clinical development of MDM2 antagonists for the
treatment of liposarcoma that overexpress MDM2 and show the
promise of this transcriptional dataset to provide additional novel
targets for drug discovery.
