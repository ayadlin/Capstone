ABSTRACT
Emerging data highlight the significance of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand
12/chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCL12/CXCR4) signaling axis in the
chemoresistance of several malignancies, including prostate cancer (PCa); however,
underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive. Here, we demonstrate that CXCL12
treatment rescues the PCa cells from docetaxel (DTX)-induced toxicity by overriding
its effect on cell cycle (G2/M phase arrest). We further demonstrate that the
chemoprotective effect of CXCL12 is abolished upon pharmacological inhibition or
RNA interference-mediated silencing of CXCR4. Moreover, microtubule stabilization
caused by DTX is suppressed in CXCL12-stimulated PCa cells as revealed by
immunofluorescence and immunoblot analyses. The effect of CXCL12 on microtubule
stabilization is abrogated when PCa cells are pre-treated with a CXCR4 antagonist.
In additional studies, we show that the chemoprotective action of CXCL12/CXCR4
signaling is mediated by p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4)-dependent activation
of Lim domain kinase 1 (LIMK1), and inhibition of either PAK4 or LIMK1 leads to
re-sensitization of PCa cells to DTX-induced tubulin polymerization and cellular
toxicity even in the presence of CXCL12. Altogether, our findings uncover a novel
mechanism underlying CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling-induced PCa chemoresistance and
suggest that targeting of this signaling axis or its downstream effector pathway could
lead to therapeutic enhancement of DTX.

after an initial response [2, 3]. Standard optional treatment
for such patients with symptomatic metastatic CR PCa is
docetaxel (DTX)-based chemotherapy, but in most cases it
offers survival advantage only for a short period of time (~3
months) due to chemoresistance [4, 5]. Therefore, further
research is required to understand the molecular mechanisms
underlying DTX-resistance in PCa, which could be helpful
in formulating alternative and superior therapeutic strategies.
DTX is a member of the ‘taxane’ group of
chemotherapeutic agents. It binds to the β-tubulin present
in the microtubules (MTs), causing mitotic arrest and

INTRODUCTION
Despite enormous scientific advancement over
the past few decades, prostate cancer (PCa) still remains the
second leading cause of cancer-related death in males in the
United States [1]. The American Cancer Society estimates
that nearly 233,000 new cases of PCa will be diagnosed
and that about 29,480 people will die of this disease this
year in the United States [1]. The first line of therapy for
metastatic PCa is chemical or medical castration; however,
most tumors relapse in castration-resistant (CR) form

subsequent apoptosis [6]. Development of DTX-resistance
is a common clinical problem; however, underlying
mechanisms remain poorly understood. It is suggested that
sustained activation of androgen-receptor (AR) signaling
in CR disease [7], activation of alternative oncogenic
survival pathways (such as EGFR, PI3K/Akt, MAPK/
ERK) [8, 9] and overexpression of βIII-tubulin and/
or drug efflux proteins [10, 11] could underlie the DTX
therapeutic failure in PCa. More recently, it has also been
suggested that tumor microenvironment also plays a major
role in cancer chemoresistance as an ‘extrinsic de novo’
factor [12]. In relation to the tumor microenvironment,
pathological involvement of the chemokine (C-X-C motif)
ligand 12/chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCL12/
CXCR4) signaling axis has been very well documented
in several malignancies, including PCa [13–15]. In
general, CXCR4 is activated upon binding to its sole
ligand, CXCL12, which initiates a series of downstream
signaling cascades responsible for downstream phenotypic
responses [15, 16]. Several lines of evidence support the
significance of this signaling node in PCa growth, invasion
and metastasis [16-18]. Furthermore, a recent study
reported that CXCL12 (produced by prostate stromal cells)
protected PCa cells from DTX toxicity, an effect that was
mediated through CXCR4 activation [19]. However, the
mechanistic basis for this observation remained unclear.
In the present study, we have investigated the
mechanism underlying chemoprotective action of
CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling in PCa. Our data demonstrate
that the activation of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling
counteracts DTX-induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest
through its effect on microtubule stability. Furthermore,
we identify an important role of p21-activated kinase
4 (PAK4)-induced LIM domain kinase 1 (LIMK1)
phosphorylation in mediating CXCR4 activation-induced
DTX resistance. These novel findings are significant in
supporting the utility of the CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling
axis as a therapeutic target, and in devising improved
therapeutic strategies.

relatively more sensitive to DTX toxicity as compared to
high CXCR4-expressing PCa cell lines (C4-2, PC3 and
DU145) (Figure 1B). It should, however, be noted that
the expression level of CXCR4 in PCa cell lines does
not precisely correlate with docetaxel sensitivity, which
could be due to the presence of additional resistance
mechanisms. Nonetheless, we observe that the silencing
(using specific siRNAs; Figure 1C) or inhibition (by
AMD3100) of CXCR4 leads to abrogation of CXCL12induced chemo-protection of CXCR4 in C4-2 and PC3
cells (Figure 1D and 1E). In next set of experiments,
we examined whether activation of CXCL12/CXCR4
signaling axis had any effect on DTX-induced G2/M phase
cell cycle arrest, which is an established mechanism of
chemotoxic action of docetaxel [20]. C4-2 and PC3 cells
were treated with DTX alone or in presence of CXCL12
and/or AMD3100, and analyzed by flow cytometry for
their cell cycle distribution. Consistent with previous
reports [20], the data show an arrest of cells in G2/M
phase of cell cycle upon DTX treatment. We observe that
61.6% and 62.1% of DTX-treated C4-2 and PC3 cells,
respectively, were present in G2/M phase as compared to
11.52% and 16.0% of control (vehicle treated) C4-2 and
PC3 cells, respectively (Figure 2). Interestingly, our data
demonstrate that CXCL12 treatment rescued the PCa
cells from DTX-induced G2/M mitotic arrest, and this
effect was abolished upon pretreatment of PCa cells with
AMD3100 (Figure 2). Altogether, our results suggest that
CXCL12/CXCR4 relieves DTX-induced G2/M phase cell
cycle arrest in PCa cells and, thus may protect them from
the cytotoxic effect of DTX.

CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling counteracts
docetaxel-induced microtubule stabilization
DTX is a microtubule-stabilizing agent, which
causes mitotic arrest following binding to polymerized
tubulins and subsequent blockage of their depolymerization
[6, 21]. Therefore, we investigated if CXCL12/CXCR4
signaling had an effect on DTX-induced stabilization of
microtubules. For this, we performed immunofluorescence
staining using an antibody against detyrosinated (glu-)
tubulin, a specific marker of polymerized tubulin [22]
on PCa cells either untreated or treated with DTX alone
or in the presence of CXCL12. Our data demonstrate
that PCa cells treated with DTX exhibit extensive
formation of microtubules, an effect that is almost
completely abrogated in CXCL12-treated cells (Figure
3A). Furthermore, our data show that the pre-treatment
of PCa cells with a CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100,
neutralizes the effect of CXCL12 and thus restores the
stabilization of microtubules (Figure 3A). To further
confirm these findings, we examined the expression of
tubulin polymerization markers [glu- and acetylated
(ace-) tubulin] by immunoblot assay. Our data show an
increased expression of both glu- and ace- tubulin in

RESULTS
Activation of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling relieves
docetaxel-induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest
We first examined the expression of CXCR4 and
its sole ligand, CXCL12, in a panel of PCa and normal/
benign prostate epithelial (RWPE1 and 2) cell lines. An
aberrant expression of CXCR4 was observed in all PCa
cell lines, while no expression was detected in normal/
benign prostate epithelial cells (Figure 1A). Moreover,
we observed that PCa cells produced very low level of
CXCL12 (range between 0.2 to 1.0 pg/ml/106 cells)
(data not shown). Next, we treated PCa cells with DTX
(0-30 nM) for 24 and 48h and examined its toxicity. The
data show that low CXCR4-expressing LNCaP cells are

co-treated with CXCL12. Similarly, the pre-treatment of
PCa cells with AMD3100 overrides the suppressive effect
of CXCL12 (Figure 3B). Taken together, these findings
demonstrate that the activation of CXCL12/CXCR4
signaling rescues the PCa cells from DTX-induced G2/M
phase cells cycle arrest by counteracting its effect on
microtubule stabilization.

counteracts DTX-induced microtubule stabilization.
Our specific focus was LIMK1, which is an important
downstream effector of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling [23]
and is known to regulate the stability of microtubules
through direct binding [24]. Our data show that
the phosphorylation of LIMK1 is increased in a
time-dependent manner following CXCL12 stimulation
in PCa cells (Figure 4A). Moreover, we observe that
CXCL12-induced LIMK1 phosphorylation is abrogated
following pretreatment with AMD3100, thus, suggesting
that this effect is mediated through CXCR4 activation
(Figure 4B). In next set of experiments, we treated PCa
cells with LIMKi3, a LIMK1 inhibitor; prior to the
treatment with CXCL12 and/or DTX and determined its
effect on overall cell survival and stability of microtubules.

show a G2/M phase-arrest in DTX-treated cells. CXCL12 abrogated DTX-induced G2/M arrest, which was reversed in the cells pre-treated
with AMD3100. Nocodazole (1 µM) was used as positive control.

Activation of LIMK1 by CXCL12/CXCR4
signaling is mediated through PAK4

Our data demonstrate that inhibition of LIMK1 neutralizes
the rescue effect of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling on DTXinduced cytotoxicity in both PCa cell lines (Figure 4C).
The data also show that the inhibition of LIMK1 leads to
abrogation of the counteracting effect of CXCL12/CXCR4
signaling on the DTX-induced microtubule stabilization
(Figure 4D). Moreover, our data from immunoprecipitation
assay reveal a direct interaction of LIMK1 with tubulin,
which is decreased upon CXCL12 stimulation (Figure 4E).
Together, these findings suggest that CXCL12/CXCR4signaling impedes DTX-induced microtubule stabilization
by promoting the phosphorylation-mediated dissociation
of LIMK1 from microtubules.

Having observed a role of LIMK1 in CXCL12/
CXCR4 signaling-induced DTX resistance, we next
sought to identify the protein kinase involved in its
phosphorylation. For this, we focused on PAK4, which
is known to cause LIMK1 phosphorylation [25].
The data show that CXCL12 treatment induces the
phosphorylation of PAK4 in a time-dependent manner,
which is abrogated upon pre-treatment of PCa cells with
a CXCR4 antagonist (AMD3100) (Figure 5A and B).
Next, we investigated if PAK4 mediates the

DISCUSSION

phosphorylation of LIMK1 in response to CXCL12
treatment. For this, PAK4 was silenced using specific
siRNAs prior to CXCL12 stimulation and its effect on
LIMK1 phosphorylation was examined. We observed
substantial silencing of PAK4 after 24 h of transfection
in both the PCa cell lines treated with siPAK4 and this
effect was sustained at least until 72 h of transfection
(data not shown). Furthermore, we observed that the
effect of CXCL12 on LIMK1 phosphorylation was
abolished in PAK4-silenced PCa cells (Figure 5C). Our
data also reveal that the effect of CXCL12/CXCR4
signaling on DTX-induced microtubule stabilization is
nullified upon silencing of PAK4 in PCa cells (Figure
5D). Together, these data suggest that CXCL12induced LIMK1 phosphorylation and DTX-resistance is
mediated through PAK4 in PCa cells through its effect
on microtubule stability.

The present study provided mechanistic support
for the chemoprotective action of CXCL12/CXCR4
signaling against DTX toxicity in PCa cells. CXCL12/
CXCR4 signaling-induced DTX-resistance was caused
by overriding the effect of DTX on cell cycle (G2/M phase
arrest) due to its counteracting effect on DTX-induced
microtubule stabilization. Additionally, we observed that
PAK4-mediated LIMK1 activation was important in the
rescue effect of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling on DTX
toxicity.
Overexpression of CXCR4 in PCa and its
association with poor patients’ survival has been well
reported [13]. It has also been demonstrated that CXCL12/
CXCR4 signaling plays an important role in the invasion
and metastasis of PCa cells [16, 18], which ultimately

promotes DTX-resistance in PCa [7]. Moreover, a recent
study performed by Domanska et al. provides direct
support to our findings, in which they have also shown
the chemoprotective role of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling in
PCa cells [19]. Furthermore, Hatano et al. have reported
that the DTX-mediated activation of the CXCR4, ERK1/2,
and c-Myc signaling loop provides survival advantage to
the PCa cells in the presence of DTX [26]. Furthermore,
a role of CXCR4 signaling in the ligand-independent
activation of AR has also been demonstrated, which could
indirectly promote DTX-resistance by promoting cell
survival [27]. Our findings further add to the list of this

supporting literature by providing mechanistic support
for a chemoprotective role of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling
in PCa. Our data also provide support to the notion
that CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling serves as the common
molecular link for the metastatic and therapy-resistant
nature of the PCa cells.
We observed that the treatment with CXCL12
effectively relieved DTX-induced G2/M phase cell cycle
arrest, an effect that was mediated through CXCR4. DTX
induced G2/M phase arrest is mediated by inhibiting
the microtubule depolymerization [20]. Microtubules

α-β-tubulin heterodimers and play an important role in
the chromosomal segregation during mitosis [21, 28].
In relation to this, our data revealed that the CXCL12mediated activation of CXCR4 counteracted DTXinduced microtubule stabilization in PCa cells. This
finding is supported by an earlier study, in which a role of
CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling has been demonstrated in the
regulation of microtubule dynamics of immune cells [29].
Furthermore, indirect support comes from another prior
report demonstrating the induction of mitotic catastrophe

activation [30].
Microtubules are highly dynamic structures and
their intracellular dynamicity is tightly regulated by
various microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). MAPs
physically interact with microtubules and promote their
stabilization and/or destabilization [31]. In our study,
we observed that the phosphorylation of LIMK1 was
increased in PCa cells upon CXCL12 stimulation.
Furthermore, data from our immunoprecipitation study

is activated upon binding to its sole ligand, CXCL12, which then leads to PAK4 phosphorylation. Activated PAK4 phosphorylates LIMK1
causing its dissociation from microtubules (MTs) and thus enhancing dynamicity of MTs. In this state, MTs are less likely to bind to DTX
and consequently less susceptible to DTX-mediated stabilization. This results in suppression of anti-mitotic effect of DTX and promotes
tumor cell survival.

the cell death [24]. Together, these data suggest that
LIMK1 acts as a MAP in its unphosphorylated state
to promote the stability of microtubules.

inhibition of LIMK1 abolished the protective effects

A similar finding is reported in a recent study,
where inhibition of LIMK1 in HeLa cells promoted

in cancer cells [14–16]. Here, we observed increased
phosphorylation of PAK4, a member of the p21-activated
kinases (PAKs) family, in CXCL12-treated PCa cells.
In concordance with our data, previously Haddad et al.
2001 have also reported the increased activity of PAK4
in CXCL12 stimulated T lymphocytes [32]. To date, the
exact molecular mechanism(s) of CXCL12/CXCR4mediated PAK4 activation is not clear. However, the
roles of several proteins kinases such as Rac/Cdc42,
PI3K/Akt, PKC, which are the downstream effectors
of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling, have been identified
in the activation of PAK4 [33]. In a recent study, Park
et al. identified an association of PAK4 activation with
increased tumorigenic potential and therapy resistance
of PCa cells [34]. Furthermore, our data provide strong
evidence that silencing of PAK4 abrogates the effects of
CXCL12 on LIMK1 phosphorylation and microtubule
dynamics, and thus promotes re-sensitization of the PCa
cells to DTX toxicity. PAK4 interaction with LIMK1
leading to its enhanced phosphorylation has also been
reported previously [25] along with demonstration of its
pathological significance in PCa [35]. In the same line,
our findings now shed new light on the importance of
this PAK4-LIMK1 axis and establish it as an essential
mediator in the chemoprotective action of the CXCL12/
CXCR4 signaling pathway.
In summary, our research findings have
demonstrated an important role of the CXCL12/CXCR4
signaling axis in DTX-resistance of PCa cells through
a novel mechanism (Figure 6). This new information
provides additional support towards the candidacy of this
signaling node as a useful target for PCa therapy.

Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO).

Treatments and transfection
PCa cells were grown in 96- and/or 6- well plates
and allowed to attain 60–70% confluence. Thereafter,
cells were treated with DTX (LC labs, Woburn, MA)
in the presence or absence of CXCL12 (100 ng/mL)
(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) as indicated in the
pertinent figure legends. To dissect the role of CXCR4
and LIM kinase 1, cells were pre-incubated for 1 h
with AMD3100 (CXCR4 antagonist; 5 μg/mL) (SigmaAldrich) and LIMKi3 (LIM kinase 1 inhibitor; 25 µM)
(EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA), respectively. For the
knockdown of CXCR4 and PAK4, cells were cultured in
6-well plates and transiently transfected with 50 nM of
non-target or target-specific siRNAs using DharmaFECT
as per the manufacturer’s protocol.

Cell growth assay
Cells were seeded in 96 well plate (3×103 cells/well)
a day prior to treatment. Cell growth was then examined
after 24 and 48 h of treatment using WST-1 assay kit
(Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) and percent
growth was calculated as described previously [37].

Total cells protein was extracted using NP-40 lysis
buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase
inhibitors and western blotting was performed as described
earlier [38]. Immunodetection was carried out using
specific primary antibodies (1:1000). Thereafter, blots
were incubated with respective HRP-labeled secondary

­structure. Chem Biol. 1999; 6:R65–R69.

Total protein from the control and CXCL12-treated
PCa cells was collected and estimated using DC Protein
Assay Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Subsequently,
protein lysates were incubated overnight at 4°C with
anti-α-tubulin (mouse mAb) or normal mouse IgG
antibodies (100:1) followed by incubation with Protein A
agarose beads (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) for next
2–3 h. Resulting antigen-antibody complex was centrifuged
at low speed (2500 g), washed and eluted. Thereafter,
whole cell lysate (input) and immunoprecipitated proteins
were subjected to electrophoresis and immunoprobed for
α-tubulin and LIMK1.
