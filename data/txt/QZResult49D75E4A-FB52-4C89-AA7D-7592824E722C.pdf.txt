underexplored. Here we identify miR-34a as a novel and critical suppressor of osteoclastogenesis,
bone resorption and the bone metastatic niche. miR-34a is down-regulated during osteoclast
differentiation. Osteoclastic miR-34a over-expressing transgenic mice exhibit lower bone
resorption and higher bone mass. Conversely, miR-34a knockout and heterozygous mice exhibit
elevated bone resorption and reduced bone mass. Consequently, ovariectomy-induced
osteoporosis, as well as bone metastasis of breast and skin cancers, are diminished in osteoclastic
miR-34a transgenic mice, and can be effectively attenuated by miR-34a nanoparticle treatment.
Mechanistically, we identify Tgif2 (transforming growth factor-beta-induced factor 2) as an
essential direct miR-34a target that is pro-osteoclastogenic. Tgif2 deletion reduces bone resorption
and abolishes miR-34a regulation. Together, using mouse genetic, pharmacological and disease
models, we reveal miR-34a as a key osteoclast suppressor and a potential therapeutic strategy to
confer skeletal protection and ameliorate bone metastasis of cancers.

We examined the levels of several cancer-related miRNAs during a time course of bone
marrow osteoclastogenesis assay (Fig. 1a). While the expression of an osteoclast marker
tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) was rapidly increased by RANKL and further
elevated by rosiglitazone7,8 (Fig. 1b), miR-34a was rapidly down-regulated by RANKL and
further diminished by rosiglitazone (Fig. 1c). The levels of miR-34b/c, two other members
in the miR-34 family, were unaffected and expressed at much lower levels than miR-34a
(Fig. 1d).

Author Manuscript

The sequence of miR-34a is evolutionally conserved and identical in mice and humans.
Osteoclast differentiation from both mouse bone marrow precursors (Fig. 1e-f) and human
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMN) (Fig. 1g-j) was inhibited by a miR-34a
precursor (pre-miR-34a) but enhanced by an antisense miR-34a inhibitor (anti-miR-34a),
indicating that miR-34a regulation of bone resorption in mice will likely translate to human
pathophysiology.
We generated osteoclastic miR-34a transgenic mice using CAG34a mice (Fig. 2a) and Tie2cre mice7,8. FACS and imaging showed that osteoclast progenitors from the 34a-Tie2-Tg
(CAG34a+Cre+) mice were converted to GFP+LacZ- whereas the controls (CAG34a+Cre-)
remained GFP-LacZ+ (Extended Data Fig. 1a-b). Northern blot confirmed the overexpression of mature-miR-34a in the bone marrow of 34a-Tie2-Tg mice (Extended Data
Fig. 1c).

Osteoclast differentiation assay reveal that the higher levels of mature miR-34a in the 34aTie2-Tg cultures resulted in a lower induction of osteoclast markers, diminished number/
size of mature osteoclasts, and reduced resorptive activity, whereas precursor proliferation
or survival was unaltered (Fig. 2b, Extended Data Fig. 1d-g). Consequently, serum bone
resorption marker CTX-1 (C-terminal telopeptides of Type I collagen) and osteoclast
number were decreased, whereas osteoblast number, bone formation rate (BFR) and mineral
apposition rate (MAR) were unaltered (Fig. 2c, Extended Data Fig. 1h-i).
μCT analysis of the proximal tibiae showed that 34a-Tie2-Tg mice had increased bone mass
and decreased structure model index (SMI), which quantifies the relative amount of plates
(SMI=0, strong) and rods (SMI=3, fragile) (Fig. 2d-e). Cortical BV/TV was also higher

(Fig. 2f). Moreover, miR-34a transgenic mice generated by three other osteoclast-targeting
cre drivers also exhibited a similar phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 2, 3). Thus, miR-34a in
the osteoclast lineage augment bone mass by suppressing osteoclastogenesis and bone
resorption.

Author Manuscript

To determine whether miR-34a is a physiologically relevant regulator of bone resorption, we
next examined miR-34a knockout (34a-KO) and heterozygous (34a-Het) mice (Fig. 2g).
Northern blot confirmed the diminished levels of miR-34a in 34a-KO (Extended Data Fig.
4a). Consistent with prior reports9,10, miR-34a deletion had no overt effect on mouse
development. Osteoclast differentiation was augmented in 34a-Het and 34a-KO cultures,
while precursor proliferation or survival was unaffected (Fig. 2h, Extended Data Fig. 4be). As a result, serum CTX-1 and osteoclast number were elevated (Fig. 2i, Extended Data
Fig. 4g-h). μCT revealed that 34a-KO and 34a-Het mice exhibited a low-bone-mass with
decreased connectivity density (Conn.D) and increased SMI (Fig. 2j-l). Global miR-34a
deletion also decreased bone formation as the serum marker P1NP (N-terminal propeptide of
type I procollagen), osteoblast number, BFR and MAR were reduced (Fig. 2m, Extended
Data Fig. 4g-h). The increased resorption in 34a-Het indicates that miR-34a function is
haploinsufficient and sensitive to dosage reduction. The recently published miR-34abc triple
KO (34abc-TKO)10 and full miR-34a KO9 also showed a similar phenotype (Extended
Data Fig. 5a-h), which validate our miR-34a gene trap mice and strengthen the finding that
miR-34a loss-of-function elevates bone resorption.

Author Manuscript

Bone marrow transplantation showed that WT mice receiving 34a-KO marrow also
exhibited higher CTX-1 (Extended Data Fig. 4f) compared to WT mice receiving WT
marrow. Furthermore, osteoclastic miR-34a conditional KO mice (34a-Tie2-KO) also
exhibited elevated osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption, but unaltered bone
formation, leading to a decreased bone mass (Extended Data Fig. 5i-n). Thus, miR-34a
deletion in the osteoclast lineage elevates bone resorption.

Author Manuscript

Our genetic findings prompt us to investigate whether pharmacological administration of a
miR-34a mimic can attenuate postmenopausal osteoporosis using an ovariectomy (OVX)
mouse model and a chitosan (CH) nanoparticle vehicle. Reduction of uterine weight in all
ovariectomized mice indicated effective estrogen depletion (Fig. 3a). Unaltered body weight
indicates the absence of obvious toxicity from CH nanoparticles (Fig. 3b). Compared to
sham controls, OVX mice treated with miR-Ctrl-CH showed increased CTX-1 and
decreased P1NP, whereas both effects were largely prevented in OVX mice treated with
miR-34a-CH (Fig. 3c-d). Consequently, OVX-induced bone loss was attenuated by
miR-34a-CH (Fig. 4e-f; Extended Data Fig. 6a). miR-34a-CH also decreased bone
resorption and increased bone formation in sham controls, leading to a higher bone mass
(Extended Data Fig. 6b-d). Biodistribution analysis showed that miR-34a level in the bone
marrow was the highest, and further increased by 5-fold by miR-34a-CH, indicating an
efficient miR-34a delivery (Fig. 3g).
In addition to acute systemic miR-34a treatment, we also examined the effects of chronic
osteoclastic miR-34a over-expression. OVX-induced bone resorption and bone loss were
also attenuated in 34a-Tie2-Tg mice without altering OVX effects on bone formation (Fig.

3h-k, Extended Data Fig. 6e). These results indicate that osteoclastic miR-34a overexpression is sufficient to impede osteoporosis, and osteoclast is a key site for miR-34a
therapeutic benefit.
To determine if osteoclastic miR-34a confers protection from bone metastases, we employed
two cancer-cell-cardiac-injection models. First, a human breast cancer cell line (MDA231BoM-1833) was xenografted into female nude mice. This model allows us to assess cancer
cells from human. Second, a mouse melanoma cell line (B16-F10) was allografted into
immunocompetent male mice. This model took consideration of adaptive immunity. In both
models, bone metastases were attenuated in 34a-Tie2-Tg and 34a-PT-Tg mice but
exacerbated in 34a-KO and 34a-Het mice (Fig. 3l-o, Extended Data Fig. 7a-f). Since
miR-34a remained intact in the exogenous cancer cells, the altered bone metastases resulted
from the altered miR-34a in the bone microenvironment of the host.

Author Manuscript

Pharmacologically, we tested both a treatment protocol using the human breast cancer model
and a prevention protocol using the mouse melanoma model. In both cases, bone metastases
were diminished by miR-34a-CH (Fig. 3p-s). Systemic miR-34a-CH delivery affected
neither tumor growth nor metastasis to other organs such as lung (Extended Data Fig. 8ab). Moreover, treating only the cancer cells with miR-34a-CH before injection had no effect
(Extended Data Fig. 8c-d). Consistent with the published finding that miR-34abc deletion
does not increase tumorigenesis10, our 34a-KO mice also showed unaltered cancer
susceptibility (Extended Data Fig. 8e).

Author Manuscript

Since systemic miR-34a-CH treatment not only decreases bone resorption but also increases
bone formation, we examined the effects of miR-34a over-expression in osteoblasts. We
bred the CAG34a mice with Osterix-CreER mice to generate 34a-Osx-Tg mice. Osteoblast
differentiation was reduced for 34a-KO and 34a-Het mice, but increased for 34a-Osx-Tg
mice (Extended Data Fig. 9a-d). Consequently, 34a-Osx-Tg mice exhibited a higher bone
formation but unaltered bone resorption, leading to an increased bone mass (Extended Data
Fig. 9e-g). Importantly however, the elevated bone formation alone in the 34a-Osx-Tg mice
was insufficient to attenuate either OVX-induced bone loss or cancer bone metastases
(Extended Data Fig. 9h-i). Together, our conditional miR-34a transgenic mouse models
pinpointed the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic benefits of miR-34a by revealing that
osteoclast, rather than cancer cell or osteoblast, is the critical and essential player.

Author Manuscript

To elucidate the mechanisms, we identified Tgif2 as a novel direct miR-34a target in the
osteoclast lineage (Extended Data Fig. 10a-c). Tgif2 expression was suppressed by
miR-34a gain-of-function, but increased by miR-34a loss-of-function, in both mouse and
human osteoclast cultures (Fig. 4a-b, Extended Data Fig. 10d-e). The miR-34a seed region
in Tgif2 3′UTR is evolutionally conserved in mammals (Fig. 4c). Luciferase reporter assay
showed that Tgif2 3′UTR is sufficient to confer miR-34a regulation (Fig. 4d-e).
Importantly, when the miR-34a seed region in the Tgif2 3′UTR was mutated, miR-34a
regulation was abolished (Fig. 4d-e).
Tgif2 expression was increased during WT osteoclast differentiation (Fig. 4b). Tgif2-KO
and Tgif2-Het mice had lower bone resorption and higher bone mass (Fig. 4f-h, Extended

Data Fig. 10f). Tgif2 deletion reduced osteoclast differentiation, and abolished the antiosteoclastogenic effects of miR-34a (Fig. 4i-j). Moreover, Tgif2/miR-34a double knockout
mice (DKO) could no longer increase osteoclast differentiation or bone resorption (Fig. 4kl) compared to Tgif2-KO mice. These results indicate that Tgif2 is pro-osteoclastogenic and
essential for miR-34a regulation.

Author Manuscript

We next investigated how Tgif2 potentiates RANKL signaling. Transfection assays revealed
that NFATc1, c-fos and c-jun, also to a lesser extent NFκB (p65), could induce Tgif2
expression (Fig. 4m). Response elements for NFATc1 and AP-1, but not NFκB, were
identified in the Tgif2 promoter region (-5Kb to +5Kb). ChIP analysis in osteoclast cultures
showed that NFATc1, c-jun and c-fos bound to these sites upon RANKL stimulation,
leading to activated Tgif2 transcription shown by the elevated H3K4me3 level at the
transcription start site (Fig. 4n). This indicates that NFATc1 and AP-1 induce Tgif2
expression during osteoclastogenesis.
Luciferase reporter assay showed that Tgif2 augmented the activity of NFATc1, NFκB and
c-Jun, but not c-fos (Fig. 6o). Consistently, the activity of endogenous NFATc1, NFκB and
c-Jun, but not c-fos, was reduced in Tgif2-KO cultures and enhanced in 34a-KO cultures
(Fig. 4p). Furthermore, NFATc1 mRNA, c-Jun phosphorylation and IκBα degradation were
decreased in Tgif2-KO cultures and increased in 34a-KO cultures (Fig. 4q-r). Therefore,
Tgif2 potentiates osteoclastogenesis via a positive feedback loop in which RANKL-induced
transcription factors activate Tgif2 expression, and Tgif2 in turn promotes their activity.
Collectively, these findings reveal Tgif2 as a novel yet critical regulator of
osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption, as well as a key miR-34a direct target that is
essential for miR-34a regulation (Fig. 4s).

Author Manuscript

The roles of miRNAs in bone physiology have just begun to emerge. Recent studies show
that osteoblast-specific gain-of-function of miR-34b/c decreases bone mass by suppressing
osteoblastogenesis and bone formation11,12. Here we show that osteoclast-specific miR-34a
gain-of-function protects bone by suppressing osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. These
findings uncover an interesting functional divergence among the miR-34 family members.
Our study paves the road for future discovery of other miRNAs that may be regulated by
RANKL and/or control Tgif2 expression, as well as future epidemiological and clinical
studies to explore the pathological and therapeutic roles of this miR-34a-Tgif2 pathway in
human.

Most systemically delivered drugs can target multiple tissues and cell types. We found that
miR-34a also enhances bone formation; although miR-34a over-expression in osteoblast is
neither sufficient nor essential for the therapeutic benefits of miR-34a in osteoporosis or
bone metastasis, miR-34a may be a superior new therapy that exerts both anti-catabolic and
anabolic effects compared to the current drugs that are solely anti-catabolic. Our
identification of miR-34a, as well as the recent report of miR-141 and miR-21913, opens an
exciting avenue for the development of a whole new generation of RNA-based osteoprotective medicine.

Other miR-34a target genes have been reported in different biological context, such as
SIRT114, SIRT615 and PNUTS16. Although miR-34a may also target genes other than Tgif2
in osteoclasts, our genetic rescue ex vivo and in vivo show that Tgif2 is the key miR-34a
target, suggesting that other genes are likely secondary or functionally irrelevant to
osteoclastogenesis.

miR-34abc are commonly deleted in human cancers17. In vitro studies suggest that
miR-34abc may be critical mediators of p53 function and potential tumor suppressors18.
Surprisingly, in vivo studies reveal that miR-34abc triple KO mice exhibit intact p53
function without increased tumorigenesis10. Nonetheless, systemic miR-34a administration
can indeed attenuate cancer malignancy19. This raises the intriguing possibility that its anticancer effects may reside in other cells that constitute the tumor microenvironment such as
the osteoclasts in the bone metastatic niche. Indeed, our findings illustrate that bone
metastases are effectively blocked by miR-34a in osteoclasts, thus providing the first in vivo
genetic evidence that miR-34a opposes malignant progression of cancer by disarming the
metastatic niche.

METHODS SUMMARY
Conditional miR-34a transgenic mice were generated using the CAG-Z-EGFP vector.
miR-34a knockout mice were generated using a gene-trap ES cell line.

METHODS
Mice

Author Manuscript

To generate cre-flox controlled conditional miR-34a transgenic mice (CAG34a), a 431 basepair genomic sequence containing 168 base pairs 5′ and 161 base pairs 3′ of the pre-miR-34a
sequence was inserted into the CAG-Z-EGFP vector20. Transgenic founders on pure
C57BL/6J background were established by pronuclear injection at the UT Southwestern
transgenic core. From 14 founders that carry the LacZ and GFP transgenes, we selected 6
founders that had the highest tail lacZ expression, and bred them to cre transgenic mice.
Representative results from at least two independent founders are reported here. To establish
osteoclastic miR-34a transgenic mice, CAG34a mice were bred with the previously
described Tie2cre mice7,8, PPARγ-tTA;TRE-cre (PT-cre) mice21, lysozyme-cre (Lys-cre)
mice22 or Ctsk-cre mice23. To establish osteoblastic miR-34a transgenic mice, CAG34a
mice were bred with the previously described Osx-CreER mice24. All conditional miR-34a
transgenic mice were on pure C57BL/6J background, and compared to littermate controls
that carry only the transgene allele or only the Cre allele; representative results for
“transgene only” group is shown as “Ctrl” group; consistent with previous studies, these Cre
lines alone do not exhibit bone phenotype. miR-34a knockout mice in a C57BL/6-129P2
mixed genetic background were generated using a mouse embryonic stem cell line
(International Gene Trap Consortium clone YHA350) harboring a gene-trap integration in
the miR-34a transcription unit, and backcrossed to C57BL/6J mice for at least five
generations. In this gene-trap allele, a splice-acceptor followed by a β-geo cassette (fusion of
β-galactosidase and neomycin transferase) was inserted between exon 2 and 3 of the mouse
miR-34a gene, leading to a truncated and non-functional pri-miR-34a transcript. miR-34abc

triple knockout mice and WT controls in a C57BL/6-129SvJae mixed background were
provided by Dr. Andrea Ventura (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center)10. miR-34a full
knockout mice and WT controls on a pure C57BL/6 background were provided by Dr. Lin
He (University of California at Berkeley)9. Tgif2-KO mice on a C57BL/6-129 mixed
background were provided by Dr. David Wotton (University Of Virginia)25. miR-34a flox
mice on a pure C57BL/6 background were from Jackson Laboratory9. Osteoclastic miR-34a
conditional KO mice (34a-Tie2-KO) were generated by breeding miR-34a flox mice with
Tie2-cre mice. Bone marrow transplantation was performed as described7. Briefly, bone
marrow cells from 2-month-old male donor (WT or 34a-KO) were intravenously
transplanted into five 2-month-old male C57BL/6J recipients that were irradiated at lethal
dose (1000 roentgen); the mice were analyzed 3 month post transplantation. Ovariectomy or
sham operation was performed on 10-20 week old female mice. miRNA-carrying chitosan
(CH) nanoparticles26 were delivered by intravenous injections at 5μg/mouse or 10μg/mouse
twice per week for 4-5 weeks. Sample size estimate was based on power analyses performed
using SAS 9.3 TS X64_7PRO platform. With the observed group differences which is of
great biological value, and the relatively small variation of the in vivo measurements, a
sample size of four per group (n=4) will provide higher than 90% power at type I error rate
of 0.05 (two-sided test), and a sample size of three per group (n=3) will provide higher than
80% power at type I error rate of 0.05 (two-sided test). For example, on BV/TV measures
with a mean difference of 0.12 between the WT and mutant groups (standard deviation of
0.035 and 0.03 for each of the two groups), 4 mice per group will yield 98% power and 3
mice per group will yield 83% power using two sample t-test. Samples were randomly
allocated to each group. Analyses were conducted in a blind fashion to the operator. All
experiments were conducted using littermates. All protocols for mouse experiments were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center.

(7 micron resolution). Trabecular bone parameters were calculated using the Scanco
software to analyze the bone scans from the trabecular region directly distal to the proximal
tibial growth plate. As a bone resorption marker, serum CTX-1 was measured with the
RatLapsTM EIA kit (Immunodiagnostic Systems)27. As a bone formation marker, serum
amino-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (P1NP) was measured with the Rat/Mouse

(20mg/kg) were injected into 2 month old mice 2 and 10 days before bone collection.
Ex Vivo Osteoclast and Osteoblast Differentiation

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Osteoclasts were differentiated from bone marrow cells as described7,8. Briefly,
hematopoietic bone marrow cells were purified with 40μm cell strainer, and differentiated
with 40ng/ml of mouse M-CSF (R&D Systems) in α-MEM containing 10% FBS for 3 days,
then with 40ng/ml of mouse MCSF and 100ng/ml of mouse RANKL (R&D Systems) for
3-9 days, in the presence or absence of rosiglitazone (1μM). Mature osteoclasts were
identified as multinucleated (>3 nuclei) TRAP+ cells. Osteoclast differentiation was
quantified by the RNA expression of osteoclast marker genes using RT-QPCR analysis, as
well as number and size of mature osteoclasts. For osteoclast resorptive function analyses,
bone marrow osteoclast differentiation was conducted in OsteoAssay bone plates (Lonza),
and osteoclast activity was quantified as calcium release from bone into culture medium
using CalciFluo ELISA assay (Lonza). Osteoclast precursor proliferation was quantified
using a bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) cell proliferation assay kit (GE Healthcare) as
described27. Osteoclast apoptosis was quantified using Annexin V: PE Apoptosis Detection
Kit I (BD Biosciences). Human PBMN cells (ReachBio) were differentiated into osteoclasts
in α-MEM containing 10% FBS, 25ng/ml MCSF, 50ng/ml hRANKL, 1μM Dexamethasome
and 1μM rosiglitazone for 14 days; pre-miR or anti-miR were transfected on day 0 and day
6; human RANKL was added on day 7. Osteoblasts were differentiated from bone marrow
cells as described27.
Gene Expression Analyses
For mRNA expression, RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using an ABI High
Capacity cDNA RT Kit (Life Technologies) and then analyzed using real-time quantitative
PCR (SYBR Green) in triplicate. All mRNA expression was normalized by L19. For mature
miRNA expression, RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using NCode VILO miRNA
cDNA Synthesis Kit (Life Technologies) and then analyzed in triplicate using real-time
quantitative PCR (SYBR Green) and a primer specific for the mature miRNA. All miRNA
expression was normalized by sno251.

Identification of miR-34a Targets in the Osteoclast Lineage
To elucidate the molecular mechanisms for miR-34a inhibition of osteoclastogenessi and
bone resorption, we identified key direct miR-34a target genes that are pro-osteoclastogenic.
First, we used the TargetScan bioinformatic tool to predict all the miR-34a targets by
searching for conserved 8mer or 7mer sites that match the miR-34a seed region. Second, we
searched databases such as BioGPS to select secondary targets that are expressed in the
macrophage-osteoclast lineage. Third, we performed RT-QPCR to select tertiary targets that

can be inhibited by miR-34a during osteoclast differentiation. Fourth, we performed
luciferase reporter assay to test if the 3′UTR of each tertiary target could directly suppress
gene expression in response to miR-34a. To generate a CMV-Luc-3′UTR reporter, a ~300bp
Tgif2 3′UTR region centering the miR-34a target sequence was cloned into the pMIRREPORT™ vector (Life Technologies) downstream of the luciferase open reading frame.
To generate a mutant reporter with miss-matched miR-34a binding site, the miR-34a target
sequence was altered using QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).
The reporters were co-transfected with CMV-β-gal (as an internal transfection control),
together with pre-miR-34a or pre-miR-control, anti-miR-34a or anti-miR-control using
FuGENE HD reagent (Roche). The transfection assay was conducted in human embryonic
kidney 293 cells and CV-1 monkey kidney cells to assess the intrinsic properties of the
3′UTR in different cellular context, and representative results for 293 cells are shown.
Luciferase activity was normalized by β-gal activity.

efficiently migrate to the bone28. Bone metastases were detected and quantified weekly post
injection by bioluminescence imaging (BLI) using a Caliper Xenogen Spectrum instrument
at UTSW small animal imaging core facility. The osteolytic metastatic lesions were imaged
by radiography using Faxitron Cabinet X-ray System with the X-ray tube voltage fixed at 26
kVp and the exposure time at 15 s. The luciferase-labeled bone-metastasis-prone MDAMB-231 human breast cancer cell sub-line (MDA231-BoM-1833)29 was generously
provided by Joan Massagué (a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center) and injected into 6-week-old female nude mice (NCI) at
1×105 cells/mouse in 100μl PBS. The luciferase-labeled B16-F10 mouse melanoma cell
line30 was generously provided by Katherine Weilbaecher (Washington University) and
injected into 8-week-old male C57BL/6J mice at 5×104/mouse in 100μl PBS.
Statistical Analyses
All statistical analyses were performed with Student's t-Test and represented as mean ±
standard deviation (SD) unless noted otherwise. No animal or sample was excluded from the
analysis. The p values were designated as: *, p<0.05; **, p<0.01; ***, p<0.005; ****,
p<0.001; n.s. non-significant (p>0.05).

a, Systemic miR-34a-CH delivery did not affect the growth of B16-F10 melanoma cells
injected subcutaneously (n=5, male, 8 week old). Tumors were collected 18 days after cell
injection, result is shown as average ± s.e. b, Systemic miR-34a-CH delivery did not affect
cancer metastasis to other organs such as lung (n=5, male, 8 week old). B16-F10 cells were
i.v. injected retro-orbitally, BLI signals were quantified 2 weeks later and the result is shown
as average ± s.e. c-d, MiR-34a-CH treatment of cancer cell alone was not sufficient to
inhibit bone metastasis. BoM-1833 cells were treated with miR-34a-CH or miR-Ctrl-CH in
cultures for 24hrs before cardiac injection (n=5, male, 6 week old), and the mice were not
treated with nanoparticles. c, Quantification of bone metastasis BLI signal 5 weeks after
injection, shown as average ± s.e. d, MiR-34a over-expression in BoM-1833 cells persisted
for 5 weeks in cultures. e, Loss-of-function in 34a-KO and 34a-Het mice did not result in
significantly increased susceptibility of cancer and mortality. Left, Kaplan-Meier survival

Elevated levels of mature miR-34a in 34a-Osx-Tg osteoblast differentiation cultures on day
13 (n=6). d, Osteoblast differentiation was increased for bone marrow from 34a-Osx-Tg
mice compared to control mice, quantified by osteoblast marker genes osteocalcin and
Col1a1 on day 13 (n=6). e, Serum P1NP was increased in 34a-Osx-Tg mice (n=6). f, Serum
CTX-1 was unaltered in 34a-Osx-Tg mice (n=6). g, Histomorphometry of distal femur and
vertebrae in 34a-Osx-Tg and control mice. h, OVX-induced bone resorption and bone loss
was unaltered in 34a-Osx-Tg mice. 34a-Osx-Tg mice or controls (3-month-old and 2 months
after tamoxifen injection, female, n=5) were subjected to OVX or sham operation and
analyzed 5 weeks post-surgery. i, Cancer bone metastasis was unaltered in 34a-Osx-Tg mice
(n=8). Statistical analyses in i were performed with Mann Whitney Test and are shown as
mean ± standard error.
