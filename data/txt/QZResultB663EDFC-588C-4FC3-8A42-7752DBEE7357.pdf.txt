ABSTRACT
We have explored the potential for clinical implementation of ATAD2 as a
biomarker for aggressive endometrial cancer by investigating to what extent
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for ATAD2 is feasible, reflects clinical phenotype
and molecular subgroups of endometrial carcinomas. Increased expression of the
ATAD2 gene has been implicated in cancer development and progression in a number
of tissues, but few studies have investigated ATAD2 expression using IHC. Here we
show that high ATAD2 protein expression is significantly associated with established
clinical-pathological variables for aggressive endometrial cancer, also in the subset of
estrogen receptor α (ERα) positive tumors. Protein and mRNA expression of ATAD2
were highly correlated (P < 0.001), suggesting that IHC staining may represent a
more clinically applicable measure of ATAD2 level in routinely collected formalin
fixed paraffin embedded specimens. Gene expression alterations in samples with high
ATAD2 expression revealed upregulation of several cancer-related genes (B-MYB,
CDCs, E2Fs) and gene sets that previously have been linked to aggressive disease
and potential for new targeting therapies. Our results support that IHC staining for
ATAD2 may be a clinically applicable biomarker reflecting clinical phenotype and
targetable alterations in endometrial carcinomas to be further explored in controlled
clinical trials.

INTRODUCTION

Endometrial cancer is one of the most common female
cancers in industrialized countries, with rising incidencerate. In general, the overall prognosis is good, however
in 15-20% of patients the disease recurs. In contrast to
breast cancer, neither hormone receptor status, nor other
biomarkers are currently implemented in clinical use.

One of today’s most important clinical challenges
is to develop clinically applicable and robust biomarkers
to predict prognosis and to select patients for customized
systemic treatments more likely to be beneficiary [1, 2].

More robust biomarkers that independently can predict
prognosis in order to improve treatment of endometrial
cancer need to be developed [3].
One of the hallmarks of cancer is sustained
proliferation. Altered gene expression of regulators
of proliferation or reprogramming of distinct cellular
pathways allows the cancer cell to bypass normal cell
cycle control. The gene ATAD2 (ATPase family, AAA
domain containing 2; also listed as ANCCA, pro2000)
is predominantly expressed in male germ cells, but
becomes overexpressed in several cancer forms. It was
initially identified as a target gene of the proto-oncogene
AIB1 and as a transcriptional coactivator of ERα in
breast cancer cells [4]. Further studies demonstrated
that ATAD2 is overexpressed in several types of human
cancers, including breast cancer, prostate cancer and lung
cancer [4-8]. Moreover, its elevated transcripts were early
included in a number of prognostic cancer-gene signatures
that are linked to cancer development and progression such
as increased risks of distant metastasis in breast cancer [9,
10] and disease recurrence in endometrial cancer [11].
The ATAD2 protein acts as a transcriptional coregulator, both in hormone dependent gene transcription
through its interactions with the hormone receptors ER
and AR [12], and in transcriptional regulation by E2Fs and
MYC through their direct interaction [6, 13]. In hormone
dependent cancer cells ATAD2 is an estrogen and androgen
responsive gene and also a co-activator for full activity of
ER and AR [4, 14]. The ATAD2 protein has also received
attention due to its “drugable” composition. In addition
to its N-terminal part that interacts with E2F and AR,
ATAD2 consists of a bromodomain capable of binding
to acetylated histones, and the AAA ATPase domain
that possesses ATPase activity and mediates protein
multimerization [4, 5, 13]. Both the bromodomain and the
AAA ATPase domain could be targeted by small molecule
inhibitors, and the recent chemical synthesis of the ATAD2
bromodomain could facilitate further studies of the
function of the protein [15]. Combined with its apparent
wide overexpression in cancers, this leaves ATAD2 as a
promising target for therapy in several cancers and calls
for further investigations of its expression in specific
cancer types.
Few studies have investigated ATAD2 protein
expression by IHC, mainly due to lack of commercially
available specific antibodies. We here apply an antibody
previously shown to specifically detect ATAD2 expression
in breast cancer [7] to explore the potential for clinical
implementation of ATAD2 as a biomarker for aggressive
disease in endometrial cancer. We have investigated
to what extent IHC staining for ATAD2 is feasible,
reflects clinical phenotype and molecular subgroups of
endometrial carcinomas. To shed light on the biological
processes involved in cancers with high ATAD2 protein,
gene expression analyses were performed in parallel.
Our results support ATAD2 as a prognostic marker in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

endometrial cancer, and also imply that ATAD2 might be
a promising predictive marker for specific treatment in the
future.

RESULTS
Increased ATAD2 expression associates with more
aggressive stages of disease and is correlated to
copy-number alterations
High ATAD2 expression has been linked to
aggressive disease in breast cancer and endometrial
cancer but little is known regarding the variation in ATAD2
mRNA expression related to different stages of disease
development for endometrial cancer. We investigated
the mRNA levels of ATAD2 in a unique collection of
fresh tissue from 18 precursor cancer lesions (complex
atypical hyperplasias, CAHs), 141 primary endometrial
cancer lesions of the endometrioid subtype and 34 of
non-endometrioid subtypes, as well as 42 metastatic
lesions (Figure 1). We find that the expression of ATAD2
increases in early stages of cancer progression, with a
significant increase in ATAD2 expression from CAH
lesions to grade 1 endometrioid lesions (P < 0.001) and
a further significant increase from grade 1/2 to grade 3
endometrioid endometrial cancers (P < 0.001). ATAD2
mRNA levels are equally high in grade 3 endometrioid
lesions, non-endometrioid and metastatic lesions. We have
previously shown by SNP analyses of 70 cases that the

Figure 1: ATAD2 mRNA expression is elevated in
aggressive stages of endometrial cancer. A significant
increase in ATAD2 expression was found from complex atypical
hyperplasias (CAH; n = 18) to grade 1 (n = 49) endometrioid
endometrial carcinomas (EEC) (P < 0.001), with a further
increase from grade 2 (n = 53) to grade 3 (n = 39) EECs (P <
0.001). Non-endometrioid (NEEC, n = 34) tumors showed the
same high levels of ATAD2 as grade 3 EEC. ATAD2 expression
is high in metastases from both EECs (n = 22) and NEECs (n =
19).

increase in ATAD2 associates with amplification of the
8q24 region [16]. To further explore possible underlying
mechanisms for increased ATAD2 levels we utilized
publicly available data from the The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) consortium to investigate specific ATAD2 copy
number alterations and DNA methylation status of ATAD2.
In the pan cancer dataset, accessed through the TCGA
copy number portal, ATAD2 was frequently amplified in 8
out of 11 total cancer types (including endometrial cancer,
Supplementary Table S1), with the overall frequency of
amplification of 31%. However, these amplifications were
not due to the ATAD2 gene specifically being amplified,
but rather larger regions within the 8q24 region containing
the gene. The event of deletions (frequency of 2%) was not
significant in any cancers across the pan cancer dataset. To
explore ATAD2 alterations in detail for endometrial cancer,
putative copy-number alterations (GISTIC-based analysis
[17]), showed a highly significant correlation of increased
copy-number levels and mRNA expression of ATAD2
for endometrial cancer, confirming previous findings
that ATAD2 amplification leads to higher expression of
ATAD2 (Supplementary Figure S1A). In contrast, when
investigating the DNA methylation status of ATAD2
(through 13 specific ATAD2 probes available in the k450
DNA methylation dataset from TCGA), we found the gene
to be almost completely hypomethylated, suggesting that
loss of DNA methylation is not a plausible mechanism
providing elevated ATAD2 levels in endometrial cancer
(Supplementary Figure S1B).

receptors ERα (P < 0.001), PR (P < 0.001) and Androgen
Receptor (AR; P = 0.009), indicating that ATAD2 may
be a biomarker relevant to identify patients unlikely to
respond to antihormonal treatment. In survival analysis
(Figure 3A), high ATAD2 significantly predicts poor
disease-specific survival in univariate analysis (P < 0.001).
The validity and robustness of antibodies to detect
prognostic biomarkers is debated due to the possibility for
unspecific staining. Expression data from 155 overlapping
patients is available from microarrays of the 564 patients
explored for protein level by immunohistochemistry. We
find a highly significant correlation between mRNA and
protein levels (P < 0.001, Figure 3B) supporting that
immunohistochemical staining adequately reflects mRNA
level. In line with this, grouping mRNA in accordance
with IHC median cutoff into two equal patient groups
is significantly associated with poor prognosis, with a
5-years disease specific survival of 72% compared to 88%
for patients with high ATAD2 mRNA (p = 0.006). For

Immunohistological staining of ATAD2 is
associated with reduced disease-specific survival,
and correlates well with mRNA expression levels
To investigate the prognostic impact of ATAD2
protein level in endometrial cancer, 564 primary tumors
were stained by immunohistochemistry. ATAD2 is
detected in the nuclei of cancer cells, with little staining in
cytoplasm or surrounding stromal tissue (Figure 2). Only
nuclear staining was recorded. 50% of all cases showed
low expression (Index 0, 1 and 2; Figure 2A and 2B), 32%
showed intermediate expression (Index 3 and 4; Figure
2C and 2D) and 18% showed high expression (Index
6 and 9; Figure 2E and 2F) of ATAD2. For subsequent
analyses, intermediate and high expression groups were
combined according to similar survival pattern. Details
regarding scoring of ATAD2 are given in the method
section. When comparing ATAD2 expression with clinical
and histopathological variables for aggressive endometrial
cancer, we find a highly significant association between
high ATAD2 expression and high FIGO (International
Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) stage, nonendometrioid subtype, high grade and aneuploidy (Table
1; all P-values ≤0.001). ATAD2 expression is also
negatively correlated with protein expression of hormone

have an even stronger prognostic impact with a 5-years
disease specific survival of 58% compared to 88% for
patients with high ATAD2 mRNA (P < 0.001, Figure 3C)
suggesting a potential for using mRNA assessment as an
even stronger prognostic marker, although currently less
applicable in a routine clinical setting. This is in line with
our previous observation in a smaller dataset [16]. Taken
together, our findings support that immunohistochemical
staining for ATAD2 represent a clinically applicable
method to measure phenotype relevant ATAD2 level

morphologic assessment during the IHC analysis.

endometrial cancer. We found ATAD2 to significantly
predict poor survival in both ERα positive (Figure 4A)
and ERα negative (Figure 4B) patients. ATAD2 has been
suggested as a cofactor for ERα and therefore we focused
specifically on the prognostic impact of ATAD2 in the
ERα positive subgroup of patients. Interestingly, we find
that high ATAD2 is significantly associated with reduced
disease-specific survival (Figure 4A) and correlates with
non-endometrioid type, high grade, aneuploidy and loss
of PR receptor (all P-values≤0.002; Table 2) also in the
subgroup of ERα positive patients.
ATAD2 also proved to be significantly associated
with poor survival for patients with endometrioid
histology (Figure 4C). Cox analysis was performed for
the endometrioid subgroup since an interaction between
FIGO stage and histologic type was suspected. We find
that ATAD2 independently predicts poor survival in
the endometrioid subgroup, in a Cox regression model
adjusting for age, FIGO stage and grade (Table 3).

the top 100 regulated genes (Supplementary Table S2).
Amongst these are genes directly linked to mitosis, cell
division and cell signaling. For endometrial carcinoma
patients with high ATAD2 levels, 9 out of 20 genes known
to be directly regulated by ATAD2 in breast cancer [7],
are found to be highly expressed (highlighted in red and
listed in Supplementary Table S2). We further explored
the Connectivity Map database using this genelist to
search for drugs with treatment potential for the patient
group with high ATAD2 protein level, identifying HDAC
and PI3K-pathway inhibitors amongst the to ranked
drugs (Supplementary Table S3). To further explore the
molecular signaling pathways altered in tumors with high
ATAD2 protein levels, GSEA analysis was performed.
Tumors with high ATAD2 protein levels show signs
of increased proliferation, with gene sets linked to cell
cycle in the C5 MSigDB collection (Gene Ontology gene
sets) highly enriched (Table 4, top panel). To gain more
insight in the molecular processes underlying this, we also
explored the C2 MSigDB, representing curated gene sets
generated from online pathway databases and PubMed
publications. Among the four gene sets significantly
enriched (FDR < 0.05) in tumors with high ATAD2, three
gene sets pointed to B-MYB; the two B-MYB gene sets
published by Shepard et al [18], as well as the TFRC
targets dn published by O’Donnell et al [19]. In addition
one gene set linked to prostaglandin and E2 response
was significantly enriched in patients with high ATAD2.

signaling pathways, we explored a publically available
external dataset confirming similar enrichment for two
B-MYB gene sets and the TFRC targets dn all being
amongst the top 5 ranked gene sets related to high ATAD2
level (Supplementary Table S4).
It has been proposed that elevation of ATAD2
may lead to a loop of transcriptional overexpression of
its downstream targets such as E2Fs and ATAD2 itself
[13]. ATAD2 is both a target for, and interacts with E2F,
regulating its activity. The E2Fs transcription factors direct
transcription of B-MYB (gene name MYBL) during cell

cycle progression [20]. To explore this reported relation
in different stages of endometrial cancer, we examined
the mRNA levels separately in CAHs, primary tumors
and metastatic lesions. We find a consistent and highly
significant correlation between the gene levels for ATAD2
and E2F1, E2F2 and MYBL during all stages of disease
from precursors to metastatic lesions (Figure 5). ATAD2
amplification is most often seen in the Copy number high
(serous like) subtype of the TCGA molecular subclasses
(Supplementary Figure S2 A and B). This same pattern is
also observed for E2F1 and MYBL2, located close to the

Figure 5: Expression of ATAD2 strongly correlates with E2Fs and MYBL2 levels. The mRNA levels of the transcription

factors E2F1 and E2F2 as well as their downstream target MYBL2 (protein name B-MYB) is strongly correlated with expression levels
of ATAD2. These patterns for strong correlations are consistently seen during tumor development from precursor lesions of endometrial
cancer, complex atypical hyperplasias (A.-C.; n = 18), through primary tumors (D.-F.; n = 176) to metastatic lesions (G.-I.; n = 42).

its high expression detected also in the often ER negative
non-endometrioid tumors.
Molecular profiling of patients according to ATAD2
level was performed to explore genetic alterations
associated with increase in ATAD2 expression. In
concordance with findings from breast cancer [7] we
find that ATAD2 overexpression correlate strongly
with expression of genes associated with increased
proliferation, suggesting that ATAD2 either act as an
upstream mediator of their expression or as a collaborator
of their function. GSEA analyses using the GO gene sets
(MSigDB C5) showed enrichment of gene sets linked
to cell proliferation in patients with high ATAD2 levels
(Table 4). A more specific GSEA analysis using curated
data sets (MSigDB C2) identified gene sets linked to
B-MYB signatures [18] as well as TFRC (Transferrin
receptor) and estradiol treatment as enriched in patients
with high ATAD2 in our patient cohort. This was validated
in an external dataset. In SAM analyses of primary tumors
we also found B-MYB (listed as MYBL2), E2F1 and
E2F2 to be amongst the top 20 up regulated genes in
primary tumors with high ATAD2. This strong association
of expression of E2F1, E2F2 and MYBL2 with ATAD2 is
found in both CAHs, primary and metastatic endometrial
cancer lesions, indicating that the expression of these
genes are tightly linked in all stages of endometrial
cancer. This is interesting, since links between ATAD2,
B-MYB and E2Fs has been reported also in other cancers.
In breast cancer, E2F1 protein regulates ATAD2 gene
expression [6] and B-MYB has been reported to have
a role in ATAD2 driven cell proliferation [7]. B-MYB
belongs to the MYB family of transcription factors and is
involved in regulation of cell cycle at several levels [22].
B-MYB is also shown to cooperate with E2F transcription
factors to regulate genes important for G2/M transition
[20]. Also in prostate cancer E2F1 binds the ATAD2 gene
regulatory region to activate its gene transcription [23]. A
similar relationship between E2Fs, ATAD2 and B-MYB
has not been investigated in endometrial cancer. However
our data support that these genes cooperate to drive
proliferation, resulting in aggressive disease. As already
shown in breast cancer, we also find several members of
the Kinesin protein family (KIF11, KIF15, KIF23, KIF2C
and KIFC1) to be upregulated in patients with high
expression of ATAD2. Kinesins have important roles in
cell division and signaling, and ATAD2 has been shown
to regulate expression of key kinesin members, both in
the presence and absence of estrogen in breast cancer cell
lines [24]. Aberrant expression of kinesins has also been
linked to resistance to taxol treatment and attempts have
been made to target these proteins in cancer [25]. Given
the high number of kinesins with altered expression in
our study, a more detailed study should be undertaken to
pinpoint the specific role of the different family members
in endometrial cancer.
Several prognostic gene signatures defined in cancer

region 20q13 often amplified in the serous like molecular
sub group of endometrial cancer [11], indicating that in
addition to a transcriptional link, these genes may also be
co-amplified due to general genomic instability.

DISCUSSION
Recent studies suggest that ATAD2 is overexpressed
in several cancers and that ATAD2 may have a potential
both as a biomarker and as a therapeutic target. We have
previously identified and also recently validated ATAD2
as one of 29 genes predicting recurrence in an endometrial
cancer recurrence score [11, 21]. Also ATAD2 mRNA level
has been linked to MYC expression and amplification of
the 8q24 region [16]. Here, we further explore expression
of ATAD2 mRNA and the protein levels of ATAD2 by
IHC and investigate its potential as a prognostic marker
in endometrial cancer. We find that ATAD2 is low in
CAH lesions, in line with the apparent no expression
in normal uterine tissue [5]. Compared to the precursor
lesions CAH, we see a significantly increase in ATAD2
in grade 1 endometrioid cancers with a further increase
to grade 3 endometrioid endometrial cancers. ATAD2
levels are high also in non-endometrioid endometrial
cancers and metastatic lesions. The mechanism involved
in the observed increase in ATAD2 level during cancer
development is only partially understood. Elevated
levels of ATAD2 have been linked to gene amplification.
Although DNA methylation could represent an additional
mechanism contributing to increased expression, we do not
find sufficient evidence that this is the case investigating
publically available TCGA data. This is contrasting the
significant association between the increase in mRNA
expression and increase in gene copy number, supporting
that gene copy number changes are the most dominant
mechanism causing the elevated expression of ATAD2
observed in endometrial cancers.
We have applied the previously validated antibody
to detect ATAD2 protein expression in endometrial cancer
in relation to clinico-pathological parameters. We find
that high expression of ATAD2 predicts poor outcome
and significantly associates with markers for aggressive
endometrial cancer, such as high FIGO stage and high
grade, non-endometrioid type, and loss of hormone
receptors AR, PR and ERα. This is in line with findings
from breast cancer, where high ATAD2 detected by IHC
is associated with aggressive disease [7]. We find ATAD2
to be an independent prognostic marker in endometrioid
tumors and high ATAD2 corresponds with aggressive
disease for ERα positive patients. ATAD2 has been
described as an estrogen and androgen responsive gene
in hormone dependent cancer cells and a co-activator for
full activity of ER and AR [4, 14], contributing to cancer
related proliferation. Our results may point to a similar
regulation of ATAD2 also in endometrial cancer. However,
additional mechanistic impact by ATAD2 is evident given

include ATAD2. Some have been prospectively validated
to reflect poor outcome [21]. In addition, we and others
have shown that increased ATAD2 may predict survival,
and we here confirm that ATAD2 protein assessed by
IHC is an independent prognostic marker in endometrioid
endometrial cancer patients. Combined with the increased
efforts to target bromodomain-containing proteins in
cancer [15, 26], ATAD2 seems an attractive cancer protein
for more detailed studies. It is also interesting that our
molecular analyses point to PI3K-pathway and HDAC
inhibitors as potential drugs for treatment of patients with
high ATAD2. This is in line with previous observations
regarding treatment of aggressive molecular subclasses
of endometrial cancers, but needs further validation in a
clinical setting, possibly alongside validation of ATAD2
as a biomarker for endometrial cancer.
The molecular mechanisms underlying the
aggressive behavior of tumors with high ATAD2 is still
poorly understood in endometrial cancer. However
our data points to changes in regulators of cell cycle
progression as potential key players. Identifying the
relationship between these as well as the other major
downstream effectors may point to development and/or
testing of novel therapeutics in endometrial carcinoma
clinical trials.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Immunohistochemistry
Ethics statement

FFPE tissue from 564 patients was used to construct
tissue microarrays (TMAs) as previously described [28].
Briefly, three cylinders of 0.6 mm were retrieved from
high tumor purity areas using a custom-made precision
instrument (Beecher Instruments, Silver Spring, MD,
USA) and mounted in a paraffin block. TMA sections
(5µm) were stained for ATAD2 expression using a
validated antibody and a protocol described previously
[7]. AR expression was detected using ab133273
(Abcam) diluted 1:100 for 1 hour at room temperature
followed by 30 min incubation with secondary HRPconjugated antibody. Diaminobenzidine was applied
for 8 min, before counterstained with hematoxylin. The
immunostained sections were scored visually by light
microscopy, blinded for the patients clinical characteristics
and outcome, using a semi quantitative and subjective
method described in more detail previously [29]. Tumor
tissue in all three cylinders were assessed to estimate the
average protein staining. Briefly, a staining index was
calculated as a product of staining intensity (0-3) and area
of positive tumor cells (1≤10%, 2 = 10-50% and 3≥50%).
In subsequent statistical analyses, indexes were grouped
according to similarity in survival and considering the
size of the subgroups and the number of events in each
category. Index 0-2 (n = 281) was considered low, index
3-9 (n = 283) was considered high. Hormone receptor

All parts of the study have been approved according
to Norwegian legislation as well as international demands
for ethical review. Patients were included in the study
after written informed consent approved by the ethics
committee (REK West). The study was approved by the
Norwegian Data Inspectorate, Norwegian Social Sciences
Data Services, and the Western Regional Committee
for Medical and Health Research Ethics, REC West
(NSD15501; REK 052.01).

Tumor specimens
A patient series counting 585 patients diagnosed
with primary endometrial carcinoma in Hordaland County
(Norway) during the period 2001-2012 were prospectively
collected. Patients were staged according to FIGO 2009
criteria and age at diagnosis, histologic type, histologic
grade, treatment and follow-up were obtained from
the clinical records and routine histopathology reports
from a tumor board setting. Formalin-fixed paraffinembedded (FFPE) tissue from 564 patients was used for
immunohistochemistry, while fresh frozen tissues from 18
CAH, 176 primary endometrial cancers (155 overlapping
with TMA cases) and 42 metastatic lesions were available

status was defined by IHC and recorded using the same
soring system. Index 0-2 was defined as ERα negative
status while index 3-9 as ERα positive. For PR and AR
status, index 0 was considered negative while index 1-9
positive. Details related to scoring methods applied and
approaches to cut point development for ER and PR
hormone receptor status have been reported previously
[30, 31]. P53 protein expression status was available for
383 patients with ATAD2 protein status. P53 IHC protocol
and scoring has been published previously [32].

protein was assessed using the drug signatures database
Connectivity Map [34] as previously described [27]. The
microarray data is publicly available at ArrayExpress, with
accession number E-MTAB-2532.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were done using IBM SPSS
Statistics software version 21 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).
All tests were two sided, and probability of < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant. For categorical
variables groups were compared using Pearson chi-square
test, and Mann-Whitney U test was used to test correlations
for continuous variables. Univariate survival analyses
of time to death due to endometrial carcinoma (disease
specific survival) were performed using the Kaplan-Meier
(product-limit) method. Entry date was defined as date
of primary surgery, and patients who died from other
causes were censored at the date of death. Differences
in survival between groups were estimated by the logrank (Mantel Cox) test. The prognostic impact of ATAD2
adjusted for other prognostic markers was evaluated
by the Cox proportional hazard regression models. All
variables included were examined by log minus log plots
to assure that the assumptions of proportional hazards
were satisfied. Since an interaction between histologic
type and FIGO stage was suspected, the Cox analysis was
performed for the endometrioid subgroup.

Gene expression analyses
Gene expression alterations in relation to ATAD2
expression were investigated in fresh tissues from 18
CAH, 176 primary endometrial cancers and 42 metastatic
endometrial cancer lesions derived from 31 patients.
Expression data from a subset of these patients from 122
of the primary tumors and 19 metastases have previously
been explored in relation to copy number changes for
the MYC region in endometrial cancer [16]. Samples
were validation for high tumor cell content [33]. Areas
with necrosis were avoided. RNA was extracted using
the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and
hybridised to Agilent Whole Human Genome Microarrays
44k (Cat.no. G4112F), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Microarrays were scanned using the Agilent
Microarray Scanner Bundle. Normalization of raw data
and expression analyses were performed using J-Express
software (Molmine, Bergen, Norway). Expression data
were quantile normalized. Median spot signal was used
as intensity measure. For survival analyses using mRNA
values, values were grouped either according to IHC
cutoff (two equally sized patient groups) or in quartiles,
where the upper quartile was defined as high expression.
Differentially expressed genes in tumors with high levels
of ATAD2, detected by IHC, were identified using the
Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) method. 275
genes were identified with False discovery rate (FDR)
value < 0.05. Two class unpaired gene set enrichment
analysis (GSEA) was performed using SAM score as
scoring method and balanced sample permutations. The
Molecular signature database v4.0 (MSigDB) C2 Curated
gene set collection and C5 GO gene sets were used (http://
www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp). Only
gene sets with FDR < 0.05 was considered significantly
enriched. To validate the findings from our dataset, an
external dataset with mRNA values from 111 endometrial
cancer patients was investigated to compare transcriptional
alterations related to high versus low ATAD2 level. Given
the high correlation between ATAD2 protein measured
with IHC and mRNA levels found in our dataset, median
level of ATAD2 was defined as cut point in the external
dataset in accordance with detected IHC cutoff. The
correlation between global gene expression pattern and
potential new therapeutics for tumors with high ATAD2
