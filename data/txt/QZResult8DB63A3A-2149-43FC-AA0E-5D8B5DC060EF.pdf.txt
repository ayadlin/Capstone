Abstract
LIM kinases (LIMK) are emerging targets for cancer therapy, and
they function as network hubs to coordinate actin and microtubule dynamics. When LIMKs are inhibited, actin microﬁlaments
are disorganized and microtubules are stabilized. Owing to their
stabilizing effect on microtubules, LIMK inhibitors may provide a
therapeutic strategy to treat taxane-resistant cancers. In this study,
we investigated the effect of LIMK inhibition on breast tumor
development and on paclitaxel-resistant tumors, using a novel
selective LIMK inhibitor termed Pyr1. Treatment of breast cancer
cells, including paclitaxel-resistant cells, blocked their invasion
and proliferation in vitro and their growth in vivo in tumor

xenograft assays. The tumor-invasive properties of Pyr1 were
investigated in vivo by intravital microscopy of tumor xenografts.
A striking change of cell morphology was observed with a rounded phenotype arising in a subpopulation of cells, while other cells
remained elongated. Notably, although Pyr1 decreased the motility of elongated cells, it increased the motility of rounded cells in
the tumor. Pyr1 administration prevented the growth of metastasis but not their spread. Overall, our results provided a preclinical proof of concept concerning how a small-molecule inhibitor
of LIMK may offer a strategy to treat taxane-resistant breast tumors
and metastases. Cancer Res; 76(12); 3541–52. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

of this effect on actin microﬁlament dynamics, LIMKs regulate
microtubule dynamics (2–4), but whether this regulation occurs
through a direct binding of LIMK to microtubules (5) or through
phosphorylation of an associated protein (6) is still under debate.
When LIMKs are inhibited, microtubules are stabilized and actin
microﬁlaments are severed and disorganized (2, 4).
Thus, LIMKs function as central network hubs coordinating
several cellular- and tissue-level responses by regulating both actin
microﬁlament and microtubule assembly (7). In pathophysiologic conditions, pharmacologic inhibition of LIMK could have
antitumor and antimetastatic effects, given the involvement of the
actin and the microtubule cytoskeleton in cell division and in cell
motility. The LIMK family of serine/threonine kinases includes
two highly related members, LIMK1 and LIMK2 (1). LIMK activity
is mainly regulated by the Rho-GTPases (RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42)
through their downstream kinases ROCK, PAK1, PAK4, and
MRCK (1). The activation of the Rho-GTPases and their effectors,
including LIMK, have been reported as playing important roles in
tumor development and progression (8–13). Expression of LIMK
or coﬁlin phosphorylation is elevated in malignant melanoma
(14), glioma (15), prostate (4, 16, 17), and breast tumors (18, 19).
In breast cancer models, activation of LIMK is the last step of an
integrin-linked machinery of cytoskeletal regulation that enables
tumor initiation and metastatic colonization (20). Thus, LIMK are
enzymes whose activity is elevated in cancers compared with
normal tissue. Consequently, their inhibition could selectively
target tumors and offer a large therapeutic window.
Chemotherapy is a component of the treatment of invasive
breast cancers. One of the most important classes of chemotherapy agents is the taxanes, which bind and stabilize microtubules.
Taxane resistance, however, limits treatment options and creates a
major challenge for clinicians. Taxane's general antimitotic and

LIM kinases (LIMK) regulate the architecture of the actin
cytoskeleton by phosphorylation and inactivation of actin depolymerization factors of the ADF/coﬁlin family (1). Independently

microtubule-stabilizing actions also result in severe side effects,
such as myelosuppression or neurotoxicity. Rather than chemotherapeutic agents interacting directly with the microtubule network, the use of drugs that target microtubule regulators, such as
LIMK, is hence an attractive alternative therapeutic strategy.
LIMKs are considered as emerging targets for cancer therapy
(21), and an increasing number of inhibitors is reported in the
literature (2, 22–28). Among these inhibitors, few, if any, fulﬁll
the three criteria that are important for in vivo experiments, that is,
high selectivity, complete characterization of the effects on both
actin and microtubule dynamics, and knowledge of toxicity on
animals.
We have previously identiﬁed and characterized a highly selective LIMK inhibitor, Pyr1 (2). Although ATP competitive, Pyr1
inhibits only LIMK out of 110 kinases tested. When applied on
cells, Pyr1 stabilizes microtubules, induces a cell-cycle arrest at the
S-G2–M phases, and, through inhibition of coﬁlin phosphorylation, blocks actin microﬁlament dynamics. We have also shown
that Pyr1 was active in vitro on paclitaxel-sensitive and -resistant
cancerous cell lines and displayed a therapeutic activity in an in vivo
murine model of leukemia L1210, while being well tolerated (2).
Because of the selectivity of this cell-permeable inhibitor and its
good tolerance in vivo, the aims of this study were (i) to investigate
the effect of LIMK inhibition on breast cancer development and
(ii) to test the hypothesis that LIMK inhibition is efﬁcient in
paclitaxel-resistant cancers. The effects of Pyr1 on paclitaxel-resistant breast cancers have been analyzed thoroughly, both in vitro
and in vivo on xenografted models of primary tumor growth and
on metastasis. In response to Pyr1 treatment, intratumoral cell
movement and tumor cell morphology have been monitored
using intravital imaging. Our results show that Pyr1 displays an
antitumoral activity. Intravital microscopy revealed morphologic
changes of the tumor cells and perturbation of their motile
behavior within the tumor when treated with Pyr1. Finally,
although Pyr1 did not prevent metastases, it led to an important
reduction of the metastatic load. These results indicate that LIMK
inhibitors might represent both a pharmacologic alternative to
the treatment of taxane-resistant primary tumors and potent
agents to reduce the growth of metastases.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Murine mammary adenocarcinoma cells TS/A-pGL3 (20, 29)
and human cells MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 (ATCC), routinely
tested and authenticated by the ATCC, were cultured as recommended. MDA-MB-231 cells overexpressing the transcription
factor ZNF217 (MDA-MB-231-ZNF217rvLuc2) were grown as
described previously (30). For intravital microscopy experiments,
MDA-MB-231 cells were modiﬁed in J. van Rheenen's team (for
details, see Supplementary Information). Mouse embryonic
ﬁbroblast (MEF) cells were a generous gift from Dr. Richard
Hynes (Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA). The expression of
the constitutive active form of the Src kinase (SrcY527F) was
performed as described in the Supplementary Information.
Western blots
The antibodies used were from Cell Signaling Technology, that
is, coﬁlin (ref. 5175), phospho-coﬁlin (ser3; ref. 3313), and
b-actin (ref. 4967).

Immunoﬂuorescence analysis
Immunoﬂuorescence analysis of the modiﬁcation of cellular
microtubule dynamics using nocodazole was realized as
described previously (2).
Cell viability
Cell viability was analyzed using MTT assay as described
previously (2).
Matrigel invasion assay
Cells (5  104) were plated on top of a layer of Matrigel in
Transwell chambers (Biocoat, BD Biosciences). After 24-hour
incubation with 25 mmol/L Pyr1 or 0.25% DMSO, nuclei of
cells that reached the bottom of the transwell were stained
with Hoechst. Cell invasion was quantiﬁed by counting the
number of invading cells using ImageJ software (NIH,
Bethesda, MD).
FRAP analysis
FRAP analysis was performed as described previously (31) on
MEF SrcY527F cells transfected with GFP-actin and treated or not
with 25 mmol/L Pyr1 just before bleaching. Changes of ﬂuorescent
intensity within the bleached area were measured over 2 minutes,
and the characteristic time of recovery was quantiﬁed using the
ZEN software from Zeiss.
Wound-healing assay
Cells were seeded in culture inserts (ibidi, 80206). Two days
later, inserts were removed and 25 mmol/L Pyr1 or 0.25% DMSO
was added in the medium. Recovery of the wound was recorded
during 12 hours using video microscopy. Velocity, total displacement, and persistence were calculated using the MTrackJ
plugin (http://www.imagescience.org/meijering/software/mtrackj/
manual/) from ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD).
Spheroids
Spheroids were derived from MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB231-ZNF217rvLuc2 cells using the Matrigel-on-top culture as
described by Shibue and colleagues (32). After 5 days of culture,
spheroids were treated with 25 mmol/L Pyr1 or 0.25% DMSO.
Filopodia number and length were quantiﬁed using an inverted
microscope. A total of 25 spheroids from three different experiments were analyzed in each group.
In vivo experiments
All animal studies were conducted in accordance with European Union guidelines and approved by the regional ethics
committee. The animals were examined daily for mortality and
morbidity. Weight was monitored twice a week, and behavior was
carefully examined every day from the beginning of treatments
(grooming, postures, spontaneous movement in the cage, and
touch response)
Populations of 5  105 TS/A-pGL3 cells, stably transfected with
luciferase, were suspended in PBS and injected into the mammary
fat pad of 30 NMRI nude mice. Seven days later, mice were
randomized in three equal groups and drugs [Pyr1, synthesized
by C-H Nguyen, Institut Curie, France, 10 mg/kg, PTX (Sigma,
T1912, 10 mg/kg), or vehicle (36% PEG 400, 10% DMSO,
and 54% NaCl 0.9%)] were injected intraperitoneally daily.
Tumor growth was monitored by bioluminescence twice a week.
Before each bioluminescence imaging (IVIS Kinetic; Caliper),

Pharmacologic Inhibition of LIMK Effect on Breast Tumors

anesthetized mice received an intraperitoneal injection of luciferin (Promega).
Populations of 10  106 MDA-MB-231 cells were suspended in
PBS/Matrigel v/v (BD Biosciences) and injected subcutaneously
into the right ﬂank of 30 NMRI nude mice. When tumors were
palpable, that is, 21 days after cell injection, mice were randomized in 3 equal groups and drugs were injected intraperitoneally
daily, as described above. Tumor growth was monitored 3 times a
week with a sliding caliper.
Populations of 5  105 MDA-MB-231 Dendra2 cells were
suspended in PBS and injected into the mammary fat pad of 7
female NSG. The ﬁrst group (4 mice) was injected with 10 mg/kg
Pyr1 and the second (3 mice) with vehicle [36% polyethylene
glycol (PEG) 400, 10% DMSO, and 54% NaCl 0.9%]. Treatments
were injected intraperitoneally daily and started between 30 and
45 days after cell injection, that is, when tumors were palpable and
window implanted. Imaging sessions started 2 days after mammary window implantation. Each session lasted 2 hours with one
stack every 15 minutes. Each mouse was imaged twice a week
during 2 weeks. Mice were anesthetized and intravital imaging
was achieved as described previously (33). Details of the methods
used for tumoral cells migration tracking and for quantiﬁcation of
ﬂuorescent signal in MDA-MB-231 Dendra2 tumors are presented
in the Supplementary Information.
Populations of 2.5  105 MDA-MB-231-ZNF217rvLuc2 cells
stably transfected with luciferase were suspended in PBS and
injected in the left ventricle of 40 NMRI nude mice. The quality
of cell implantation was checked immediately after injection by
bioluminescence, and only mice with validated implantation
were included in the experiment. Treatments started 3 days before
cell injection. The ﬁrst group of 15 mice was injected intraperitoneally daily with 10 mg/kg Pyr1 and the second group of 9 mice
was injected with vehicle (36% PEG 400, 10% DMSO, and 54%
NaCl 0.9%). Metastatic colonization was monitored by bioluminescence as described above.
Ki67 staining
MDA-MB-231 Dendra2 tumors were ﬁxed overnight at 4 C in
periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde (PLP) buffer (4% PFA 2.5
mL, NaIO4 0.0212 g, L-lysine 3.75 mL, P-buffer pH 7.4 3.75 mL).
The ﬁxed tissues were then washed twice with PLP buffer and
placed for 6 hours in 30% sucrose at 4 C. Tumors were embedded
in OCT tissue-freezing medium (Jung). Tumor sections (14 mm)
were incubated with Ki67 antibody (Abcam, 66155) overnight
and then with A647-conjugated secondary antibody. Proliferation was evaluated as the number of Ki67-positive cells per ﬁeld 
SEM. A total of 6 ﬁelds were examined and counted for each tumor
in each group.
TUNEL
TUNEL labeling was performed using In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Invitrogen, C10247). Tumor sections (14 mm) were
counterstained with Hoechst. The apoptotic index corresponded
to the number of TUNEL-positive cells per ﬁeld. A total of 6 ﬁelds
were examined and counted for each tumor in each group.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using t test, except for tumor
growth and cell migration in vivo experiments, for which a Mann–
Whitney test was used. Results with P < 0.05 were considered to be
statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
Pyr1 treatment decreases breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro
As the expression level of LIMK1 and its activity have been
reported to be increased in invasive breast cancer cells (34, 35), we
ﬁrst characterized the different cell lines used in this study, that is,
TS/A-pGL3, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-231-ZNF217rvLuc2,
regarding their level of expression of LIMK1. Using Western
blotting, we found that the endogenous level of LIMK1 was at
least 50% higher in these invasive cell lines, as compared with
MCF-7 cells, a noninvasive cell line (Supplementary Fig. S1A and
S1B; refs. 34, 36).
These cell lines have been described to show resistance to PTX
(37–39). We conﬁrmed that PTX had almost no effect on TS/ApGL3 cell viability and reduced MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-231ZNF217rvLuc2 cell viability by only 30% to 40% over 24 to 48
hours, relative to vehicle control (Supplementary Fig. S2).
We then tested if the LIMK inhibitor Pyr1 was active on these
cell lines by measuring its effect on coﬁlin phosphorylation and
on microtubule dynamics. Coﬁlin phosphorylation was quantiﬁed by Western blotting, and slowing down of microtubule
dynamics was assessed by evaluation of the resistance of the
microtubule network to nocodazole-induced depolymerization.
Nocodazole binds free tubulin and prevents its incorporation into
microtubules, inducing microtubule depolymerization. Stabilized microtubules, with slow dynamics, have reduced exchanges
with the free tubulin pool and are thus less sensitive to nocodazole-induced depolymerization (2).
Although showing some variation between cell lines, Pyr1
consistently inhibited coﬁlin phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Moreover, Pyr1 protected the microtubule
network from nocodazole-induced depolymerization (Fig. 1B),
indicating that microtubules were stabilized.
We then analyzed the toxicity of Pyr1 on these cell lines.
Toxicity proﬁles were obtained by determining population cell
viability in response to a 48-hour incubation with Pyr1 (0–25
mmol/L). As shown in Fig. 1C, Pyr1 has a signiﬁcant effect on the
proliferation of these cell lines, reducing their viability by about
90%. The GI50 (50% of growth inhibition) of Pyr1 was 1.4 mmol/L
for TS/A-pGL3, 3.9 mmol/L for MDA-MB-231, and 7 mmol/L for
MDA-MB-231-ZNF217rvLuc2.
Thus, in vitro, Pyr1 affects the proliferation of invasive cells that
exhibit resistance to PTX.
Pyr1 treatment of xenograft tumor–bearing mice induces a
signiﬁcant decrease of tumor size
As Pyr1 affects the in vitro proliferation of mammary and breast
cancer cell lines, we further analyzed its effect on tumors xenografted to mice and compared it with the PTX effect, administrated
at a therapeutic dose (40).
Although Pyr1 did not induce detectable adverse effects (Supplementary Fig. S3), PTX-treated mice were motionless, displayed
swollen abdomen, and lost weight after 2 weeks of treatment. This
led to the arrest of the experiment for ethical issues. Consistent
with the in vitro cell viability results, PTX was unable to stop the
growth of TS/A-pGL3 tumors, whereas Pyr1 stopped their growth
(Fig. 2A and B).
Pyr1 contains an ester moiety, which could be subjected to
hydrolysis in vivo. We thus analyzed the intravenous concentration of Pyr1 and of its 9-OH metabolite M1, lacking the ester
moiety, after a single intraperitoneal injection of 10 mg/kg of
Pyr1. We found that 25 minutes after the initial injection, Pyr1 was

undetectable in the blood, whereas its metabolite M1 was present.
M1 concentration decreased progressively to reach its basal level
within 2 hours (Supplementary Fig. S4). This is in line with the
high distribution volume, which indicates that compounds exit
quickly from the plasmatic compartment. As we have shown that
M1 is also able to inhibit LIMK, both in vitro and in cells
(compound 3; ref. 2), we hypothesize that the observed effect
results mainly from the combined action of Pyr1 and its 9-OH
metabolite. For the sake of clarity, the generic term Pyr1 will be
further used to refer to Pyr1 and its metabolite.
Tumors were excised at the end of the experiment, and
several markers related to microtubule and actin regulation
(Supplementary Table S1) were quantiﬁed using a reversephase protein array (RPPA). Among these markers, the level
of phospho-coﬁlin in tumors was not signiﬁcantly different
between Pyr1-treated mice and vehicle-treated mice. The levels
of acetylated- and detyrosinated tubulin, which are indirect
markers of microtubule stabilization (2), were found signiﬁcantly increased in Pyr1-treated mice, as compared with the
vehicle-treated mice. Such an increase was not detected in the
tumors of PTX-treated mice, which could be correlated with the
absence of a PTX effect on tumor growth (Supplementary Fig.

3544 Cancer Res; 76(12) June 15, 2016

S5). These results strongly suggest that the Pyr1 effect in tumors
involves microtubule stabilization.
Next, the effect of Pyr1 and PTX on subcutaneous MDA-MB231 xenografts was also compared. When the tumors reached a
palpable size (200–300 mm3), Pyr1 and PTX were injected daily.
As for TS/A-pGL3 experiments, the endpoint of the experiment
was governed by PTX-induced side effects. Pyr1, as well as PTX,
induced a statistically signiﬁcant decrease (40%–50%) of the
tumor volume (Fig. 2C).
Tumors were excised at the end of the experiment and cut in two
pieces. One piece was used to analyze the structure of the tumors.
Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the tumor sections showed
that the cellular density of Pyr1- and PTX-treated tumors was
greatly reduced, conﬁrming the antitumor effect of these compounds (Supplementary Fig. S6).
The phosphorylated-coﬁlin and the detyrosinated tubulin contents were analyzed by Western blotting, using the other piece,
and quantiﬁed. Whereas no statistical difference was observed
when comparing the level of phosphorylated-coﬁlin in vehicleand Pyr1- or PTX-treated tumors, a consistent enhancement of the
level of detyrosinated-tubulin was observed in Pyr1- and PTXtreated tumors (Supplementary Fig. S7). Again, this suggests that

the antitumor effect of the PTX and Pyr1 involved a stabilization
of microtubules.
Taken together, these results indicate that Pyr1 has a potent
antitumor effect on primary mammary tumors in breast cancer
models, even on PTX-resistant tumors, such as TS/A-pGL3.
Pyr1 treatment inhibits the invasive migration of breast cancer
cell lines and the formation of ﬁlopodium-like protrusions
in vitro
It has been shown that interfering with LIMK function either by
using RNAi (16) or by overexpression of a dominant negative
form of LIMK1 in metastatic breast cancer cells (34) or by
pharmacologic LIMK inhibition (41) results in reduced cell
invasiveness.
Moreover, as LIMK expression is correlated with the aggressiveness of cancer cells (13, 19, 20) we decided to investigate
whether LIMK inhibition by Pyr1 impacted TS/A-pGL3, MDAMB-231, and MDA-MB-231-ZNF217rvLuc2 invasiveness in vitro.
We examined the Pyr1 effect on the motility of cells using a
wound-healing assay. We observed that Pyr1 signiﬁcantly reduced
the motility of the three cell lines (Fig. 3A). After tracking the cells
individually, we found that Pyr1 reduced the speed of cell move-

www.aacrjournals.org

ment by approximately 75%. The total displacement was reduced
at least by 50%. Pyr1 also reduced the directionality of the cell
movement (Fig. 3B).
We then analyzed the Pyr1 effect on invasive migration of these
cells through Matrigel in Transwell chambers. Cells were seeded in
the insert of the chambers and after 24 hours, the nuclei of
invasive cells were counted. As shown in Fig. 3C, Pyr1 exerted
a strong inhibitory effect on the invasion of the three cell lines.
Invasion involves specialized ﬁnger-like actin structures,
called invadosomes in cancer cells, which can be induced by
the expression of a constitutively active form of Src (42). These
structures self-assemble into round metastructures known as
rosettes or rings (31). We investigated the effect of LIMK
inhibition on actin dynamics in invadosomes using MEF cells
expressing a constitutively active form of Src (Src Y527F) and
Lifeact-RFP.
We ﬁrst observed that cells treated for 2 hours with 25 mmol/L of
Pyr1 showed disorganized invadosomes. Instead of the normal
ring structure, the actin cytoskeleton was often reorganized into
actin spots, indicating that actin dynamics was perturbed (Fig.
3D). FRAP analysis of the few remaining invadosomes after Pyr1
treatment allowed measuring the net ﬂux of GFP-actin into these

structures. We found that the time of recovery doubled in invadosomes of Pyr1-treated cells compared with control cells, indicating that actin dynamics was strongly slowed down (Fig. 3E;
Supplementary Movie S1). This result suggests that the cyclic
phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of coﬁlin is central for actin
dynamics in invadosomes (43) and that complete blockade of
coﬁlin phosphorylation through LIMK inhibition leads to unbalanced actin dynamics.
We conclude from these experiments that, in vitro, Pyr1 is able
to slow down cell motility and to suppress invasion.
We further explored the consequences of LIMK inhibition in the
processes that allow the survival and proliferation of cancer cells
after their settling in the parenchyma of distant tissues. It has been
shown that the ability of breast cancer cell lines to settle in a
foreign tissue is determined by their capacity to extend abundant
actin-rich protrusions morphologically resembling ﬁlopodia,
called ﬁlopodium-like protrusions (FLP), when cultured in three
dimensions (36). The activation of the ILK/b-parvin/coﬁlin pathway leads to the activation of LIMK to govern FLP lifetime (20).
Blocking this pathway through the production of constitutively
active coﬁlin has been shown to impair FLPs formation (20). We
wondered whether pharmacologic inhibition of LIMK could also
impact on FLP formation. MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-231ZNF217rvLuc2 cells were thus propagated in 3-dimensional cultures using the "Matrigel-on-top" method (36), in which cells are
plated above a layer of 100% Matrigel and then covered with
culture medium containing 2% Matrigel. In such conditions, these
cells grow as spheroids. We found that about half of MDA-MB-231
and MDA-MB-231-ZNF217rvLuc2 spheroids extend FLPs. After a
2-hour treatment with 25mmol/L of Pyr1, the percentage of
spheroids with FLPs was reduced to 39% for MDA-MB-231 and
to 33% for MDA-MB-231-ZNF217rvLuc2 cells (Fig. 4A and B). We
measured the length of the remaining FLPs and found that they
were reduced by 37% for both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-231ZNF217rvLuc2 cells (Fig. 4C). Thus, pharmacologic inhibition of
LIMK has a profound effect on FLP abundance and length.

(44, 45), we then investigated the Pyr1 effect on tumor cell
motility in vivo, using intravital imaging. MDA-MB-231 cells
expressing the Dendra2 ﬂuorescent protein were implanted into
murine mammary fat pads. When the tumors were palpable, that
is, 30 to 45 days after implantation, mammary imaging windows
were surgically implanted. Mice were then injected daily with 10
mg/kg of Pyr1. As shown in Fig. 5A and in Supplementary Movies
S2 and S3, acquired images indicated that cells in the tumors of
mice treated with Pyr1 for at least 8 days were less packed than
cells in the tumors of the vehicle-treated mice. To quantify this
effect, we measured the area covered by ﬂuorescent cells. We
found that there were statistically less ﬂuorescent cells in tumors
of mice treated with Pyr1 (Fig. 5B). These results are consistent
with the reduced number of tumor cells observed in the abovedescribed experiment on subcutaneous MDA-MB-231 xenografts
treated with Pyr1 (Supplementary Fig. S6). Indeed, cell proliferation, as assessed by Ki67 staining and quantiﬁcation, was signiﬁcantly decreased in tumors of Pyr1-treated mice (Fig. 5C),
whereas the number of apoptotic cells, detected with TUNEL
staining, was signiﬁcantly increased in these tumors (Fig. 5D).
These observations conﬁrmed the antitumor effect of Pyr1.
Even though the measurement of cell velocity within the tumor
did not show any signiﬁcant difference upon Pyr1 treatment
(Fig. 6A), cell morphology was affected. Whereas 90% of cells in
vehicle-treated mice are elongated, 60% of cells displayed a
rounded morphology in Pyr1-treated mice (Figs. 5A and 6B). The
migratory properties of elongated and rounded cells were separately analyzed. Pyr1 treatment induced a signiﬁcant decrease of
both the velocity and the distance covered by elongated cells, as
compared with vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 6C and D). In contrast,
the velocity of rounded cells almost doubled. The total distance
covered by rounded cells was three times higher and their persistence was lower upon Pyr1 treatment, as compared with
elongated cells (Fig. 6C–F).
Altogether, our results indicate that in vivo Pyr1 treatment
increases the velocity of cell movements in the tumor.

distant metastases will be enhanced. Dendra2 protein expression
in cells allowed the postmortem evaluation of the colonization of
distant organs by tumor cells at the end of the intravital imaging
experiment. Quantiﬁcation of the ﬂuorescent cells in lung cryosections indicated that Pyr1 treatment did not affect the number of
metastases, contrary to expectation (Fig. 7A and B). The size of the

metastases was however signiﬁcantly reduced by Pyr1 treatment,
as the number of cells per metastasis in Pyr1-treated mice was
decreased by 90% (Fig. 7A and C), conﬁrming the strong effect of
Pyr1 on cell proliferation.

colonization, the aggressive MDA-MB-231-ZNF217rvLuc2 cells

Pharmacologic Inhibition of LIMK Effect on Breast Tumors

(30) were injected directly into the blood stream of Pyr1-treated
mice and control mice. Bioluminescence imaging demonstrated
that although Pyr1 did not affect the number of metastases, it had
a clear impact on the global metastatic load (Fig. 7D–F). Interestingly, this effect was long lasting, as the global metastatic load
did not rise steeply even 12 days after the end of the treatment (Fig.
7E). We conclude from this experiment that Pyr1 treatment had
no effect on metastasis establishment but induced a strong
reduction of metastases growth.

Discussion
In the Rho pathway, LIMK are the most distal kinases that
directly control microtubule and actin dynamics. This position in
the signaling network makes them attractive targets for pharmacologic inhibition in a therapeutic perspective. In this study, we
have explored the efﬁcacy of the LIMK inhibitor Pyr1 on breast
cancers and compared the effects of Pyr1 with those of PTX. We
found that Pyr1 was effective on PTX-resistant tumors, leading to

the reduction of tumor size, with no detectable adverse side effects
on mice. Assessing the mechanism of action of a new therapeutic
agent is important (46). In contrast to our in vitro results, we could
not detect a statistically signiﬁcant decrease of the level of coﬁlin
phosphorylation in Pyr1-treated tumors. Several explanations
may account for these differences. First, coﬁlin phosphorylation
was measured on whole-tumor extracts and putative intratumoral
differences may have been overlooked. Alternatively, as the
behavior of cells, including the migration properties, in vivo is
often different from that observed on 2-dimensional substrates
(44, 45), it is possible that the differences in coﬁlin phosphorylation and cell migration velocities are due to the 2D in vitro and
the 3D in vivo assay systems. In contrast, we found that the amount
of detyrosinated tubulin was systematically enhanced in Pyr1treated tumors, but such an enhancement that occurs upon a null
background of detyrosinated tubulin may be easier to detect than
a decrease of a normally expressed marker, such as phosphocoﬁlin.

Pharmacologic Inhibition of LIMK Effect on Breast Tumors

Although we do not exclude the possibility that Pyr1 exerts its
antitumor effect through a modiﬁcation of actin microﬁlament
dynamics, our data show that its effect strongly correlates with the
stabilization of the microtubule network.
The assembly and disassembly of actin in cellular structures,
such as lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia, is not only regulated by LIMK
but has been postulated to be an integral component of LIMKregulated cell invasion (20, 21). We have analyzed Pyr1 effects,
both in vitro and in vivo, on cell motility and invasion. We found
that although Pyr1 inhibits in vitro cell motility, its effect is more
complex in vivo. First, tumors treated with Pyr1 were heterogeneous, comprising two tumor cell populations: cells with a
rounded morphology and cells with an elongated morphology.
Second, motility differed according to the cell shape: upon Pyr1
treatment, the motility of elongated cells decreased, while the
motility of rounded cells increased. This heterogeneity likely
reﬂects the variations of intratumoral Pyr1 concentrations, which
generate two different phenotypic outcomes that differ by their
cell motility and cell shape features (47, 48).
The disparity between in vitro and in vivo observations, regarding the effect of Pyr1 on cell motility could have other explanations. Besides differences in drug dosing, differences in the duration of in vivo treatment and of in vitro assay could be at the origin
of this disparity.
The change of cell shape and motility parameters observed in
Pyr1-treated tumors could also result from modiﬁcations of the
biomechanical properties of interstitial tissue (49). More generally, a global effect of Pyr1 on the tumor microenvironment could
perturb the ﬁne balance between chemical and mechanical signals
produced by the different cell types and thus modify the shape and
the motility phenotype of tumor cells (50).
Overall, although in vitro Pyr1 has both an antiproliferative and
antimigration effect, in vivo experiments indicate that the antiproliferative effects of the drug are stronger than the migration
effects.
Although Pyr1 did not inhibit in vivo tumor cell migration
and metastasis seeding, we consistently observed that the size
of the metastases remained small, regardless whether the cells
migrated from the primary tumor or whether they were directly
injected into the circulation. Our observations indicate that
pharmacologic inhibition of LIMK impairs the proliferation of
cancer cells at their new sites of implantation. These ﬁndings
are consistent with the results obtained by Shibue and colleagues, following experimental implantation of breast cancer
cells bearing a constitutively active coﬁlin mutant that mimics
the inhibition of LIMK (20).
Taken together, our data indicate that LIMK inhibitors, such
as Pyr1, could represent potent agents to decrease the growth of

both primary tumors and their metastasis. Moreover, they are a
possible pharmacologic alternative to overcome the tumor
resistances frequently observed when patients are treated with
taxanes.
