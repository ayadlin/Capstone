Many agents are active in multiple myeloma, but the majority
of patients relapse. This clinical pattern suggests most cancer
cells are eliminated, but cells with the clonogenic potential to
mediate tumor regrowth are relatively chemoresistant. Our
previous data suggested that CD138+ multiple myeloma
plasma cells cannot undergo long-term proliferation but
rather arise from clonogenic CD138neg B cells. We compared
the relative sensitivity of these distinct cell types to clinical
antimyeloma agents and found that dexamethasone, lenadilomide, bortezomib, and 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide
inhibited CD138+ multiple myeloma plasma cells but had
little effect on CD138neg precursors in vitro. We further
characterized clonogenic multiple myeloma cells and stained
cell lines using the Hoechst side population and Aldefluor
assays. Each assay identified CD138neg cells suggesting that
they possess high drug efflux capacity and intracellular drug
detoxification activity. We also found that multiple myeloma
cells expressing the memory B-cell markers CD20 and CD27
could give rise to clonogenic multiple myeloma growth
in vitro and engraft immunodeficient nonobese diabetes/
severe combined immunodeficient mice during both primary
and secondary transplantation. Furthermore, both the side
population and Aldefluor assays were capable of identifying
circulating clonotypic memory B-cell populations within the
peripheral blood of multiple myeloma patients. Our results
suggest that circulating clonotypic B-cell populations represent
multiple myeloma stem cells, and the relative drug resistance
of these cells is mediated by processes that protect normal stem
cells from toxic injury. [Cancer Res 2008;68(1):190–7]

myeloma growth remains unclear. Early studies examining a
murine model of multiple myeloma suggested only a minority of
cells were capable of clonogenic growth (7). Similarly, studies by
Salmon and Hamburger (8) found that the cloning efficiency of
primary multiple myeloma specimens was f1 in 1,000 to 100,000
cells. To date, it has remained unclear whether these clonogenic
cells are distinct from the plasma cells that constitute the majority
of tumor cells.
Normal plasma cells are terminally differentiated and arise from
the maturation of B cells. Several groups have identified B cells
in the blood and bone marrow of multiple myeloma patients
that express the identical idiotype and Ig gene sequences as the
abnormal plasma cells (9–12). The role of these B cells in the
pathogenesis of multiple myeloma has remained unclear because
of a lack of functional studies, but we recently found that multiple
myeloma cell lines and primary bone marrow contain small populations of clonotypic B cells that do not express the characteristic
plasma cell surface antigen CD138 and are capable of clonogenic
growth and differentiation into multiple myeloma plasma cells
in vitro and in vivo (13). Recently, these data have been confirmed
by others (14).
It is possible that a biologically distinct, drug-resistant multiple
myeloma progenitor population is responsible tumor regrowth
after treatment (6). To test this hypothesis, we further characterized clonogenic multiple myeloma cells and found that they were
resistant to a number of clinically used antimultiple myeloma
agents. Furthermore, these cells resembled normal memory B cells
and displayed cellular properties characteristic of normal stem
cells, suggesting cancer and normal stem cells share multiple
mechanisms that promote drug resistance.

Introduction

Materials and Methods

Neoplastic plasma cells are the hallmark of multiple myeloma,
and their expansion in the bone marrow and production of
monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) are responsible for the manifestations of the disease. Both traditional cytotoxic agents and an
increasing number of novel compounds can produce clinical
responses (1–4). However, in spite of these therapies, multiple
myeloma remains largely incurable (5). Disease relapse suggests the
cells responsible for tumor regrowth are relatively drug resistant
(6), but a full understanding of the cell type responsible for multiple

Patient specimens, cell lines, and cell culture. Blood and bone
marrow were obtained from 16 patients with active multiple myeloma
(8 newly diagnosed and 8 relapsed) granting informed consent as approved
by the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutes Institutional Review Board. Bone
marrow mononuclear cells were isolated by density centrifugation and
depleted of CD138+ plasma cells and CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors
using antihuman CD34 and CD138 magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec).
Secondary depletion of CD138neg CD34neg cells was performed using
antihuman CD20, CD27, or CD3 microbeads. Peripheral blood B cells were
isolated after density centrifugation using the B-cell isolation kit (Miltenyi
Biotec). For nonobese diabetes/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/
SCID) mouse experiments, CD27+ B cells were further isolated by positive
magnetic selection with antihuman CD27 microbeads and two successive
rounds of magnetic enrichment. Cell purity was assessed by flow cytometry
and showed <5% contamination by relevant antigen expressing cells.
RPMI 8226 and National Cancer Institute (NCI)-H929 cell lines were
obtained from American Type Tissue Collection. For drug studies, CD138+

or CD138neg cells (1  105/mL) isolated from the cell lines or CD138neg
CD34neg cells from primary clinical samples (2  105/mL) were cultured in
RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum alone or with dexamethasone
(0.1 Amol/L; Sigma), lenalidomide (1 Amol/L; Celgene), bortezomib
(10 nmol/L; Millenium Phamaceuticals), 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide
(4HC; 30 Ag/mL), rituximab (10 Ag/mL; Genentech), or alemtuzumab
(10 Ag/mL; Berlex) for 48 h. Human AB serum (10%) was added to cells
treated with rituximab or alemtuzumab as a source of complement (15).
Cells were subsequently washed twice with medium to remove drugs then
plated in methylcellulose as previously described (13). Myeloma plasma cell
colonies consisting of >40 cells CD138+ plasma cells were scored using an
inverted microscope 14 to 21 days after plating and assessed for clonality by
flow cytometry (13).
Flow cytometric analyses. The following monoclonal antibodies were
used: mouse antihuman CD138-PE, CD27-FITC, CD27-APC, CD19-APC, and
either antihuman n or E Ig light chain-FITC or phycoerythrin antibodies
(BD PharMingen). After the addition of propidium iodide (2 Ag/mL) to
discriminate dead cells, cells were analyzed and/or sorted with a FACSAria,
FACSVantage, or MoFlo fluorescent cell sorter as previously described (13).
Post sorting analysis showed >96% purity of cell populations with >98% cell
viability.
For side population studies, RPMI 8226 and NCI-H929 cells (106/mL)
were incubated with Hoechst 33342 (10 Ag/mL; Invitrogen) for 60 min at
37jC followed by staining for 30 min at 4jC with anti-CD138. Clinical B-cell
samples were stained with Hoechst 33342 (5 Ag/mL) for 90 min at 37jC
followed by staining for 30 min at 4jC with anti-CD27 and anti-Ig light
chain antibodies. The concentration of Hoechst 33342 and incubations
times were initially identified using samples that provided the highest
frequency of side population cells with the lowest cytotoxicity determined
by propidium iodide staining. Side population cells were analyzed on a LSR
flow cytometer equipped with 424/44 nm band pass and 670 nm long pass
optical filters (Omega Optical). As a control, cells were incubated as above
with the addition of 50 Amol/L verapamil. Cells were stained for aldehyde
dehydrogenase (ALDH) using the Aldefluor reagent (Stem Cell Technologies) and CD138, CD27, or Ig light chains according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Values are presented as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) as
previously described (16).
For cell cycle analysis, RPMI 8226 and NCI-H929 cells were fixed in 70%
ethanol at 4jC for 30 min then washed and labeled with anti–CD138-FITC
antibodies for 30 min. After removal of excess antibody, cells were
incubated with RNase (50 Ag/mL) and propidium iodide (2.5 Ag/mL) for
30 min at 4jC followed by flow cytometry and DNA content analysis using
the ModFit program (Verity).
NOD/SCID mice. The use of NOD/SCID mice was approved by the Johns
Hopkins Medical Institutes Animal Care Committee. Six to eight-week-old
mice underwent pretreatment with 300 cGy irradiation (84 cGy/min using
a 137Cs g irradiator) 12 to 16 h before dorsal tail vein injection. Mice were
sacrificed when they exhibited symptoms including lethargy, anorexia, hind
limb paralysis or, in the absence of symptoms, at 20 to 26 weeks. Bone
marrow was harvested from the long bones and engraftment was
determined by staining for human CD138, CD19, and either surface or
cytoplasmic kappa or lambda Ig light chains. Cells were also stained for
mouse CD4 and CD8 to ensure symptoms were not due to endogenous
thymic lymphomas (17). For reengraftment studies, CD19+CD27+ cells were
isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and injected into secondary
recipients as above.
Immunoglobulin gene rearrangement detection. DNA was extracted
from plasma cells isolated bone marrow aspirates using CD138 magnetic
microbeads or engrafted NOD/SCID mouse bone marrow samples (1–100 
104 cells), using the QIAamp micro DNA isolation kit (Qiagen). DNA aliquots
were subjected to PCR using primers for the Ig heavy chain gene VDJ region
[FR3a, 5¶-ACACGGC(C/T)(G/C)TGTATTACTGTG-3¶; VLJH, 5¶-TGACCAGGGT(A/G/C/T)CCTTGGCCCCAG -3¶] for 30 to 40 cycles. Distilled water or
control DNA encoding a known monoclonal Ig heavy chain gene rearrangement were used as negative or positive controls, respectively. PCRamplified products were subjected to capillary electrophoresis on an ABI
PRISM 3100 genetic analyzer and evaluated using the Genescan 2.1 software

package (Applied Biosystems). For sequence analysis, PCR products were
resolved on a 2% agarose gel, and major products were isolated and ligated
into the TOPO TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) followed by DNA sequence
analysis.

Results
Multiple myeloma plasma cells and precursors display
differential drug sensitivities. We previously showed that multiple myeloma cells derived from primary clinical bone marrow
specimens and capable of in vitro clonogenic growth lack expression of the characteristic plasma cell antigen CD138 (13, 18).
Some multiple myeloma cell lines seem to recapitulate the
hierarchical cellular organization found within clinical specimens
and contain small populations of CD138neg cells that express
markers reminiscent of B cells and have relatively increased
clonogenic growth potential in vitro, compared with mature
CD138+ plasma cells (13, 14). To determine if multiple myeloma
precursors display relative drug resistance, CD138+ plasma cells
and CD138neg progenitors were isolated from the RPMI 8226 and
NCI-H929 multiple myeloma cell lines and treated with four
clinically active agents: the corticosteroid, dexamethasone; the
thalidomide analogue, lenalidomide; the proteosome inhibitor,
bortezomib; or 4HC, the active metabolite of the cytotoxic alkylator
cyclophosphamide (3, 4, 19). Similar to their clinical activity, all four
agents significantly inhibited the clonogenic growth of CD138+
plasma cells (Fig. 1A and B; P < 0.02 by Student’s t test for all
groups compared with the untreated control). In contrast, none of
the four agents significantly inhibited the clonogenic growth of
CD138neg progenitors from either cell line (Fig. 1A and B; P > 0.1).
Although the lack of in vitro clonogenic growth limited our ability
to study mature CD138+ plasma cells derived from primary clinical
samples, we studied clonogenic multiple myeloma precursors from
four multiple myeloma patients (two newly diagnosed and two
with relapsed disease) and found that they were not significantly
affected by dexamethasone (mean, 95%; range, 77%–125%),
lenalidomide (mean, 93%; range, 71%–143%), bortezomib (mean,
89%; range, 86%–107%) or 4HC (mean, 90%; range, 81%–105%;
Fig. 1C; P > 0.2 for all groups compared with the untreated control).
In addition, clonogenic precursors from newly diagnosed or
relapsed patients were similarly resistant to each of these four
agents (data not shown).
Multiple myeloma precursors display stem cell properties
that mediate drug resistance. Normal tissue–restricted adult
stem cells are highly resistant to toxic injury that seems to be
multifactorial in nature. Furthermore, some of these processes
serve as the basis for flow cytometric assays that can enrich for
adult stem cells, and we examined whether these assays could
distinguish cellular compartments in multiple myeloma. The ATPbinding cassette family of membrane transporters actively export
xenobiotics, thereby limiting the intracellular accumulation of
these compounds (20). Furthermore, efflux of the DNA binding dye
Hoechst 33342 by the ABCG2/BCRP transporter is required for
detection of the ‘‘side population’’ phenotype that is characteristic
of stem cells from many tissues (21, 22). To examine whether the
side population assay could identify clonogenic multiple myeloma
precursors, we stained two human multiple myeloma cell lines,
RPMI 8226 and NCI-H929, with Hoechst 33342 and found that each
contained small populations of side population cells (0.8%–1.9% of
total cells; Fig. 2A). Furthermore, costaining for CD138 showed
that the side population cells were almost exclusively CD138neg

H929 cell lines and stained with propidium iodide to evaluate
their cell cycle status. Similar to normal adult stem cells (25), we
found that nearly all (>98%) of the CD138neg cells in both cell lines
were in G0-G1, compared with only 72% or 77% of the CD138+ cells
(Fig. 2C).
Clonogenic multiple myeloma cells resemble memory B
cells. In human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and brain tumors,
cancer stem cells phenotypically resemble normal hematopoietic
and neural stem cells (26, 27). These findings suggest that human
cancers may arise from normal cellular compartments capable of
self-renewal. Unlike normal hematopoietic and neural stem cells
with the ability to generate multiple cell types, B cells that give rise
to plasma cells lack multilineage potential. However, in contrast to
the hematopoietic and neural systems in which self-renewal is
restricted to the most primitive cellular compartments, selfrenewal is maintained during multiple stages of B-cell development
that permits the generation of clones producing the highest affinity
antibodies as part of the adaptive immune response (28, 29).
Examination of Ig gene sequences in multiple myeloma shows
extensive somatic hypermutation without intraclonal variation,
suggesting that multiple myeloma arises from a postgerminal
center B cell (30). During the postgerminal stage of B-cell
development, self-renewal is most evident in memory B cells and
serves to maintain reactive B-cell clones during repeated rounds of
antigen exposure (31, 32). Therefore, we hypothesized that
clonogenic multiple myeloma precursors resemble memory B cells
and depleted primary bone marrow specimens of cells expressing
the B-cell surface antigen CD20 or the memory B-cell surface
marker CD27. Compared with the starting population of CD138neg
CD34neg cells, the removal of either CD20+ or CD27+ cells
significantly limited clonogenic multiple myeloma growth by 88%
and 83%, respectively (Fig. 3A; P < 0.001). In contrast, the removal
of CD3+ T cells did not have a significant effect on the clonogenic
recovery of multiple myeloma colonies (Fig. 3A; P > 0.1). Thus, the
phenotype of multiple myeloma cells with in vitro clonogenic
potential, CD138negCD20+CD27+, parallels normal memory B cells.
Surface antigen expression markedly differs between normal B
cells and plasma cells; therefore, we studied whether two
humanized monoclonal antibodies, rituximab and alemtuzumab,
that target the B-cell antigens CD20 and CD52 could inhibit
clonogenic multiple myeloma cells (33, 34). CD138neg precursors or
CD138+ plasma cells were isolated from the RPMI 8226 or NCIH929 cell lines and treated with each monoclonal antibody in
combination with human complement that strongly enhances their
in vitro activity through complement-dependent cytoxicity (15).
Neither complement alone nor the monoclonal antibodies with or
without complement affected the clonogenic growth of CD138+
plasma cells that lack the target antigens (Fig. 3B; P > 0.3 for all
groups compared with the untreated control). However, both
antibodies significantly inhibited the clonogenic recovery of
CD138neg multiple myeloma progenitors from both cell lines when
combined with complement (Fig. 3B; P < 0.01 for each combination
compared with the complement alone or untreated control
groups). Similarly, each combination of monoclonal B-cell antibody
and complement significantly inhibited the clonogenic recovery of
CD138neg multiple myeloma progenitors isolated from four primary
patient specimens (Fig. 3C; P < 0.001).
Circulating clonotypic memory B cells from multiple
myeloma patients engraft NOD/SCID mice. B cells sharing Ig
gene sequences and idiotype specificity with multiple myeloma
plasma cells have been detected in the blood and bone marrow of

(>97%) compared with the bulk of the population that was CD138+
(Fig. 2A).
ALDH, specifically ALDH1A1, mediates the biosynthesis of alltrans-retinoic acid as well as the detoxification of a variety of
compounds such as ethanol and active metabolites of cyclophosphamide (23). Normal adult stem cells typically exhibit higher
relative levels of ALDH activity than their differentiated progeny,
and the fluorescently labeled ALDH substrate Aldefluor can isolate
stem cells from a number of adult tissues (16). Staining of the RPMI
8226 and NCI-H929 cells revealed small populations of ALDH+ cells
accounting for 3.7% and 4.3% of cells, respectively (data not
shown). Furthermore, costaining cells for CD138 expression
showed that the CD138neg cells had significantly higher levels of
ALDH activity than CD138+ plasma cells (Fig. 2B).
Cellular quiescence is exhibited by most normal adult stem
cells, and this property is thought to be a major mechanism of
drug resistance (24). To determine whether multiple myeloma
precursors are relatively quiescent, immature CD138neg cells or
CD138+ plasma cells were isolated from the RPMI 8226 and NCI-

myeloma patients with Hoechst 33342 and detected small numbers of side population cells (0.18%–0.83% of total B cells; Fig. 4A
and Table 2). Further surface staining showed that the majority
(89%–97%) of the side population B cells expressed CD27 and
clonal surface Ig light chain restriction that matched each patient’s
multiple myeloma plasma cells (Fig. 4A and Table 2). In contrast,
nonside population cells contained a mixture of CD27+ memory
and CD27neg naı̈ve B cells expressing both Ig light chains (G1;
Fig. 4A). We also stained these peripheral blood CD19+ B cells with
Aldefluor and found small populations of ALDH+ cells. Similar to
the side population B cells, most (86%–93%) of the ALDH+ B cells
expressed CD27 and clonotypic surface Ig light chain (Fig. 4B and
Table 2). In contrast, ALDHneg cells contained a mixture of
nonclonal CD27-positive and CD27-negative cells expressing both n
and E Ig light chains (Fig. 4B).

multiple myeloma patients (9, 10, 35). We studied the functional
growth capacity of these cells and injected CD19+CD27+ B cells
isolated from the peripheral blood of four patients with multiple
myeloma into NOD/SCID mice. All recipient animals developed
hind limb paralysis, along with detectable human CD138+ plasma
cells (6.6%–15% of the total bone marrow cells) 4 to 6 months after
injection (Table 1). In contrast, no engraftment was detected after
the injection of 1  107 of the corresponding CD138+ plasma cells
isolated from each multiple myeloma patient (data not shown),
consistent with our previous studies (13). Furthermore, the human
plasma cells were clonally related to the original multiple myeloma
plasma cells by Ig light chain expression (Fig. 3D), Ig heavy chain
gene CDR3 length restriction (Fig. 3E), and CDR3 DNA sequence
(data not shown). Small populations of Ig light chain–restricted
CD19+CD27+ cells were also detected (0.01%–0.06% of total bone
marrow cells; Fig. 3D), and injection of these cells (10.8–100  103
cells) into secondary recipients similarly produced multiple
myeloma engraftment after 4 to 6 months (Table 1).
Clonotypic B cells in multiple myeloma exhibit stem cell
properties. Because the side population and ALDH assays
identified CD138neg precursors within multiple myeloma cell lines,
we examined whether these assays could identify multiple
myeloma precursors in primary clinical specimens. We stained
CD19+ B cells isolated from the peripheral blood of four multiple

Highly clonogenic cell populations have been identified in
several human cancers that are able to phenotypically recapitulate
the original tumor in NOD/SCID mice (26, 27, 36–38). These cells
can also be isolated from engrafted animals and retransplanted
into secondary recipients; therefore, they have the capacity to

to measure the clinical efficacy of anticancer treatments primarily
reflect changes in disease bulk and activity against mature tumor
cells (6). Because cancer stem cells are a relatively low frequency
population in most tumor types, the true inhibition of these cells is
likely to be difficult to assess early after treatment, and a
prolongation of disease remission would be required to establish
such activity. The initial clinical responses induced by dexamethasone, lenalidomide, bortezomib, and cyclophosphamide seen as
decreased bone marrow plasmacytosis and monoclonal Ig levels in
multiple myeloma likely reflect the activity of these agents against
mature multiple myeloma plasma cells. However, the inability of
dexamethasone or standard cytotoxic chemotherapy to produce
sustained clinical remissions suggests that clonogenic cells

myeloma plasma cells can be successfully xenografted into SCID
mice implanted with human fetal bone fragments. However,
engraftment of mature plasma cells in these SCID-hu mice may
primarily reflect the ability of the human bone marrow to support
implanted plasma cells and/or plasmablasts, given the important
role that the microenvironment plays in the survival of these cells
(41). In a similar fashion, the bone fragments within SCID-hu mice
have been found to support relatively mature AML blasts expressing
the myeloid antigen CD33 (42), whereas only CD34+ cells lacking
markers of lineage commitment engraft NOD/SCID mice (26).
Although stem cells have been identified in an increasing
number of human cancers, the clinical relevance and implications
of these findings remain unclear. Standard response criteria used

stem cells are likely required to prevent the continued production
of mature tumor cells and produce sustained remissions.
Monoclonal antibodies directed against B-cell surface antigens
limited multiple myeloma progenitor clonogenic growth in vitro,
suggesting that specific biological properties exhibited by multiple
myeloma cancer stem cells may effectively serve as antitumor
targets. Furthermore, we recently showed that the developmental
signaling pathway Hedgehog is up-regulated in multiple myeloma
stem cells and regulates cell fate decisions (44). Therefore, optimal
clinical strategies may require combining agents active against
multiple myeloma plasma cells to decrease tumor burden and
alleviate symptoms with those that target multiple myeloma cancer
stem cells to prevent tumor regrowth and relapse.
The combined use of surface phenotype with flow cytometric–
based functional stem cell properties facilitates the identification of
these cells within the circulation of multiple myeloma patients.
Therefore, it is possible that these methods may allow the
quantification of these cells to be used as a surrogate marker for
clinical response during cancer stem cell–directed therapies. These
results also suggest that inherent properties that distinguish normal
adult stem cells from their differentiated progeny, such as quiescence
and high expression of membrane-bound drug transporters and
intracellular detoxifying enzymes, contribute to their relative
resistance to toxic injury. The precise mechanisms responsible for
the resistance of clonogenic multiple myeloma cells to dexamethasone, 4HC, lenalidomide, and bortezomib are unknown, but
resistance to individual drugs usually occurs through multiple
cellular processes (45). Our data suggest that these same stem cell
properties contribute to the drug resistance of multiple myeloma
cancer stem cells, allowing them to persist and mediate disease
relapse in multiple myeloma patients initially responding to therapy.

responsible for tumor regrowth are insensitive to these agents and
supports our data that multiple myeloma stem cells are not
inhibited by these drugs (5). It is unknown whether lenalidomide or
bortezomib can produce durable remissions in multiple myeloma
because they have been only recently introduced for clinical use,
but we found that clonogenic multiple myeloma progenitors are
similarly resistant to these agents. It is well-known that the
antitumor activity of these agents is mediated in part by
modulating the interaction between myeloma plasma cells and
bone marrow stromal cells (41). Therefore, it is possible that our
in vitro studies failed to adequately assess the effects of these
agents on the bone marrow microenvironment, but similar to other
studies, we found that clonogenic multiple myeloma precursors
could be isolated from the peripheral blood where these factors
have little influence (39).
Our results complement a recent report describing the relative
radioresistance of glioblastoma cancer stem cells compared with
the differentiated cells that make up the bulk of the tumor mass
(43). The stark biological differences between cancer stem cells and
mature tumor cells is likely to be representative of many other
malignancies as the clinical pattern of relapse after effective
treatment can be seen in most human cancers. Therefore,
therapeutic strategies that target the specific biology of cancer
