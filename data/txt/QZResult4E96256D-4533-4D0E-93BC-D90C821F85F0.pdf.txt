ABSTRACT
Cigarette smoking contributes to the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease and lung cancer. Nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone (NNK) is the
most potent carcinogen among cigarette smoking components, and is known to enhance
migration of cancer cells. However, the effect of NNK on normal human bronchial
epithelial cells is not well studied. XB130 is a member of actin filament associated
protein family and is involved in cell morphology changes, cytoskeletal rearrangement
and outgrowth formation, as well as cell migration. We hypothesized that XB130
mediates NNK-induced migration of normal human bronchial epithelial cells. Our results
showed that, after NNK stimulation, XB130 was translocated to the cell periphery and
enriched in cell motility-associated structures, such as lamellipodia, in normal human
bronchial epithelial BEAS2B cells. Moreover, overexpression of XB130 significantly
enhanced NNK-induced migration, which requires both the N- and C-termini of XB130.
Overexpression of XB130 enhanced NNK-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation and
promoted matrix metalloproteinase-14 translocation to cell motility-associated cellular
structures after NNK stimulation. XB130-mediated NNK-induced cell migration may
contribute to airway epithelial repair; however, it may also be involved in cigarette
smoking-related chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer.

formed in tobacco smoke, and it has been shown to be the
most potent systemic lung carcinogen in rodents [7]. NNK
can bind with high affinity to the cell surface protein,
alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) that is
expressed in airway epithelial cells [4]. α7nAChR ligandmediated activation results in the stimulation of several
downstream pathways, including β-arrestin/Src, PI3K/
Akt and noradrenaline/adrenaline/β-adrenergic receptor
signalling-associated epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) pathways, which influence cell proliferation,
survival, angiogenesis, epithelial to mesenchymal tran­
sition, and migration/invasion of cells [8]. NNK can
enhance migration of lung, colon and gastric cancer cells
[9–11]. Moreover, treatment of normal human airway
epithelial cells with NNK promoted cell transformation

INTRODUCTION
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
affects over 300 million people worldwide, it was
ranked as the third-leading cause of death, killing over
3 million people each year [1]. Lung cancer is the leading
cause of cancer-related death throughout the world [2].
Cigarette smoking is the most common causes of COPD
[3], and it is also a risk factor of lung cancer. Moreover,
approximately 15% of all cancers worldwide are tobaccorelated [4]. Nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone (NNK),
also known as 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1butanone, is a nicotine-derived cigarette smoke component
and a potent tobacco-specific carcinogen [4–6]. NNK
accounts for approximately 27% of the end products

by decreasing cellular dependence on extracellular growth
factor stimulation, contact inhibition, and adherence to
extracellular matrix [5, 10]. Understanding the effects
and underlying mechanisms of NNK on normal bronchial
epithelial cells is important for preventing COPD, lung
cancer and other respiratory diseases.
Adaptor proteins act as docking sites for many
effector molecules, thereby facilitating the transfer or relay
of signals to other molecules and compartments within
the cell. There are many different adaptor proteins in cells
that are known to regulate different signal transduction
pathways and different cellular functions, such as cell
migration, invasion [12], and proliferation [13]. XB130
is a newly discovered adaptor protein and a member of
actin filament associated protein family, also known as
actin filament associated protein 1 like 2 (AFAP1L2) [14].
XB130 has three tyrosine containing SH2 domain binding
motifs and one proline-rich SH3 domain binding motif
located within its N-terminus, followed by two pleckstrin
homology (PH) domains and a coiled-coil region in the
C-terminus [15]. XB130 plays important role in signal
transduction. It can interact with c-Src protein tyrosine
kinase to mediate c-Src activation and down-stream AP-1
and SRE transactivation [14]. XB130 also interacts with
the p85α regulatory subunit of PI3K [16], and through the
PI3K/Akt pathway regulates cell survival, proliferation
and gene expression [17–19].
Airways are constantly challenged with foreign
materials and pathogens, and some insults result in airway
epithelial injury [20].Cell migration is an important
process for normal development and in tissue repair. Thus,
understanding how bronchial epithelial cellmigration
and cell signaling pathways are regulated during smoke
exposure may provide preventive and therapeutic strategies
in cigarette smoking-related diseases. When cells were
stimulated with either epidermal growth factor or protein
kinase C activator, or transfected with constitutively active
Rac, XB130 was shown to be involved in cytoskeletal
rearrangement of lamellipodium, as well as in cell
migration and invasion [21]. In the present study, we
hypothesized that XB130 may be involved in the migration
of human bronchial epithelial cells exposed to NNK.

for F-actin after NNK stimulation reveals that XB130
was enriched at punctate structures and in lamellipodia
with F-actin (Figure 1A). We established BEAS2B cells
stably expressing GFP tagged wild type XB130 (GFPXB130). Similar as endogenous XB130, GFP-XB130 was
also mainly distributed in the cytoplasm; however, it was
also found along actin stress fibres and the cortical actin
network (Figure 1B). This result suggests that even though
XB130 does not have classical actin binding motif [22],
it may be associated with filamentous actin structures,
when its concentration is enhanced locally. Upon NNK
stimulation, GFP-XB130 was redistributed and enriched
in lamellipodia and ruffles along the cell’s peripheral
membrane and in small punctate in the cytoplasm, and
again co-localizes with F-actin (Figure 1B).

NNK-induced association between XB130 and
actin cytoskeletal fraction
To further investigate XB130′s association with actin
filaments, after NNK stimulation, we used 0.2% Triton
X-100 buffer for 5 min to remove the cytosolic fraction
of cells and looked for the presence of XB130 in the actin
cytoskeletal fraction [23]. In cells expressing GFP alone,
GFP signal in the cytoplasm was completely lost except
in the nuclear region, and showed no association with
F-actin staining (Figure 2A). However, in GFP-XB130
expressing cells, the GFP-XB130 fluorescence signal was
reduced by detergent treatment but retained along the cell
periphery and within diffusely distributed cytoskeletal
structures (Figure 2A). These results show that after NNK
stimulation, a fraction of XB130 is resistant to detergent
extraction and associated with the cytoskeleton.
To further confirm that XB130 is associated with
the membranous cytoskeleton, we isolated the cytoskeletal
fraction from cell lysates using differential centrifugation.
After high-speed centrifugation of cell lysates, highly
cross-linked actin filaments, nucleus and cell debris can
be pelleted. Ultra-speed centrifugation of the previously
centrifuged supernatant allows further sedimentation
of membranous actin filaments, which are often free or
loosely cross-linked actin filaments. High- and ultraspeed centrifugation cytoskeletal extracts were prepared
from NNK pre-treated GFP-XB130 expressing cells, and
XB130 was found in the ultra-speed centrifugation pellet
but predominantly found in the TritonX-100 soluble
cytoplasmic fraction after ultra-speed centrifugation (Figure
2B, 100,000 g, S, DNase I-) and the XB130 in the crude
cytoskeleton fraction was negligible (Figure 2B, 10,000 g, P,
DNase I-). In contrast, actin was found in all three fractions.
To further determine whether XB130 was associated
with actin, DNase I was added to the cell lysates to
depolymerise filamentous actin [24] and to release
associated proteins. The depolymerization of filamentous
actin was confirmed by western blotting that shows the
absence of actin after DNase I treatment (Figure 2B,
100,000 g, P, DNase I+). The depolymerization of F-actin

NNK induces translocation of XB130 to actin
filament enriched structures
To determine the role of XB130 in the regulation of
NNK-induced airway epithelial cell motility, normal human
bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS2B) were stimulated
with NNK. In BEAS2B cells, endogenous XB130 was
mainly distributed in the cytoplasm, especially around the
peri-nucleusregion (Figure 1A) [16]. However, in NNK
stimulated cells, XB130 was re-distributed and enriched
in cytoskeletal structures at the cell periphery. Co-staining

cells. A. NNK-stimulation induced translocation of endogenous XB130 from cytoplasm to actin-rich small dots and lamellipodia at the

also led to a partitioning of XB130 exclusively in the
TritonX-100 soluble fraction (Figure 2B, 100,000 g, S,
DNase I+). The above results further support that after
NNK stimulation, XB130 is indeed associated with
filamentous actin in membranous cytoskeleton.

expressing cells were about two-fold more migratory than
GFP alone expressing cells or control BEAS2B cells. NNK
treatment did not affect migration of control cells or cells
expression GFP alone, by contrast, it significantly enhanced
the migration of cells expressing GFP-XB130 (Figure 4A).

Overexpression of XB130 enhances NNKinduced cell migration

Deletion of N- or C-terminus of XB130 decreased
NNK-induced cell migration

Our previous studies have shown that XB130 downregulation in cells resulted in reduced cell migration in both
wound healing assays and double chamber invasion assays
[21]. In the present study, cells expressing GFP-XB130
showed markedly enhanced migration than cells expressing
GFP alone in wound healing assays (Figure 3A). Eight
hours after wounding of a confluent cell layer, the wounded
area was about 95% closed in GFP-XB130 expressing
cells, whereas, GFP alone expressing cells were only able
to close the wound area by 60% (Figure 3A). Furthermore,
live-cell imaging reveals that GFP-XB130 was enriched at
the leading edge of the migrating cells, almost immediately
after cells were stimulated with NNK (Figure 3B). These
results support the notion that XB130 is involved in the
formation of protrusions related to cell motility.
To determine whether XB130 can mediate NNKinduced cell migration, GFP-XB130 or GFP alone
expressing BEAS2B cells were subjected to double
chamber chemotaxis cell migration assay. GFP-XB130

We further sought to find out which domain(s) of
XB130 is required for its participation in cell migration.
We first established several XB130 deletion mutants
(Figure 4B) tagged with GFP [16]. The GFP tagged XB130
mutants were made by 1) truncating the N-terminus
region (aa 2–169) (GFP-XB130-ΔN), 2) truncating the
C-terminus region (aa757–817) (GFP-XB130-ΔC), 3)
truncating both N- and C-terminus regions (GFP-XB130ΔC/ΔN), 4) selectively deleting a unique region (aa491–
648) (GFP-XB130-ΔUR) that is presented in XB130, but
not in other AFAP family members. BEAS2B cells stably
expressing each of the above mutants were established.
We have found that the N-terminus and C-terminus
of XB130 is responsible for translocation of XB130
to lamellipodia [21]. In agreement with the previ­
ous observations, GFP-XB130 significantly increased
NNK-induced chemotaxis cell migration, which was
significantly reduced in cells expressing N-terminus
and/or C-terminus deleted mutants, but cell migration

and membranous cytoskeletal fraction (see DNase I- group). DNase (0.5 mg/ml) treatment resulted in the loss of both actin and XB130 from
the membrane cytoskeleton fraction of BEAS2B cell lysates (see DNase I+ group).

In GFP-XB130 expressing cells the distribution of XB130
was enriched and co-localized with those actin aggregates
along the periphery of the cells (Figure 5B). In GFPXB130-ΔN expressing cells, the enrichment of XB130
along the cell periphery was partially reduced (Figure 5C).
In GFP-XB130-ΔC or GFP-XB130-ΔN/ΔC or GFP alone
expressing cells, reorganization of F-actin into aggregates
was similar to those of GFP-XB130 expressing cells,
however, GFP-XB130-ΔC or GFP-XB130-ΔN/ΔC was
not enriched along the cell periphery (Figure 5D–5E). In
GFP alone expressing cells, the GFP signal was mainly
located in the cytoplasm and no enrichment of GFP signal
was detected along the cell periphery (Figure 5A).

along the periphery of the cells; GFP-XB130, but not
GFP alone was co-localized with cortactin as the F-actin
enriched cellular protrusions (Figure 7A, as highlighted in
the inset). Further, using GFP-XB130 expressing cells, we
showed that anti-cortactin antibody pulled down XB130,
and vice versa, anti-XB130 antibody also pulled down
cortactin. The association between these proteins was
enhanced by NNK treatment (Figure 7B).

Overexpression of XB130 promotes matrix
metalloproteinase-14 (MMP-14) translocation
after NNK stimulation
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family
of proteinases capable of cleaving extracellular matrix
proteins, they are sub-divided into soluble MMPs and
membrane-type MMPs. MMP-14, a member of the
membrane-type MMP subfamily, is the most important
matrix metalloproteinase for cell migration and invasion
[28] of human airway epithelial cells [29, 30]. Before
NNK stimulation, MMP-14 was mainly found in the
cytoplasm in both GFP-XB130 and GFP vector alone
expressing cells (Figure 8). After NNK stimulation MMP14 co-localized with GFP-XB130 but not with GFP
alone, and was redistributed and enriched in lamellipodia
and ruffles at the cell membrane (Figure 8). Similar to
MMP-14, the expression of MMP-2 was also mainly
localized in the cytoplasm before NNK stimulation, but
after NNK stimulation the distribution of MMP-2 was not
significantly changed (data not shown). Unlike MMP-14
or MMP-2, MMP-9 was enriched in focal adhesion-like
cellular structures; however, this distribution pattern was
not affected by NNK stimulation (data not shown).

NNK-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of XB130
NNK is known to activate Src kinase [17]. XB130
contains a number of potential tyrosine phosphorylation
sites and is known to interact with c-Src tyrosine kinase [14]
and is also tyrosine phosphorylated by other protein tyrosine
kinases [17]. In the present study, NNK stimulation increased
tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins in a time
dependent manner. In GFP-XB130 expressing cells protein
tyrosine phosphorylation was further enhanced (Figure 6A).
In order to determine the tyrosine phosphorylation of XB130,
cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-XB130
antibody and blotted for anti-phosphotyrosine antibody.
NNK increased tyrosine phosphorylation of GFP-XB130
(Figure 6B). When cell lysates were immunoprecipitated
with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and blotted for antiXB130 or anti-GFP, increased tyrosine phosphorylation of
XB130 was confirmed (Figure 6C). We immunostained cells
with anti-phosphotyrosineantibody after NNK stimulation
(0.1 μM, 30 min). GFP alone did not translocate to the
cell periphery, however, co-localization of GFP-XB130
and anti-phosphotyrosine staining was observed at cellular
protrusions (Figure 6D), suggesting that either XB130 itself
is tyrosine phosphorylated or XB130 is associated with
tyrosine phosphorylated proteins.

DISCUSSION
In this study, upon stimulation of human bronchial
epithelial cells with NNK, cytoplasmic XB130 was
translocated and enriched in cell motility-associated
F-actin-rich cytoskeletal structures. Molecular structurefunction studies demonstrate that both the N- and C-termini
of XB130 are required for NNK-induced XB130 translation
and XB130-enhanced cell migration. Furthermore, NNK
treatment resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of XB130
and interaction of XB130 with cortactin, which may
be responsible for the translocation of XB130 to the
cytoskeleton. XB130 also promoted MMP-14 translocation
to cell motility related actin-rich cellular structures.

XB130 associates with cortactin, a cortical actin
binding protein
Cortactin is a cortical actin binding protein in the
cytoplasm that can be activated to promote polymerization
and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton, especially the
actin cortex around the cellular periphery [25, 26]. It plays
an important role in promoting lamellipodial formation and
cell migration [27]. To determine whether NNK stimulation
can increase the interaction between XB130 and cortactin,
we treated GFP-XB130 expressing cells with NNK for
30 min, followed by immunostaining for cortactin and
fluorescent staining for F-actin. Under control condition,
cortactin was located mainly in the cytoplasm. After NNK
stimulation, cortactin and F-actin co-localization was found

However, interaction between F-actin and XB130 was
decreased upon deletion of either the N- or C-terminus of
XB130. The N-terminus of XB130 contains several tyrosine
phosphorylation sites, SH2 domain binding motifs and
an SH3 domain-binding motif. Deleting these functional
structures may reduce XB130 tyrosine phosphorylation and
binding capacities with other F-actin-associated proteins. The
C-terminus we deleted is only a few amino acids away from
a coiled-coil region of XB130. The coiled-coil structure may
be responsible for protein-protein interaction. C-terminus

of N- or C-terminus of XB130 in mediating its translocation

NNK-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of many proteins.
Phosphorylation of proteins is a reversible enzymatic
reaction that can switch “on” or “off” functions of proteins,
as an important cellular regulatory mechanism [31].
Tyrosine phosphorylation of XB130, in response to NNK,
may lead to conformational change of XB130 structure, and
promote its association with other proteins, especially with
proteins in specific cellular structures, such as lamellipodia.
NNK is known to have high affinity to cell surface
receptors, such as α7nAChR, in airway epithelial cells [17].
XB130 may mediate NNK-induced signal transduction
downstream of α7nAChR in airway epithelial cells.

ultimately, on proteolytic cell migration and invasion
[38]. XB130 may play a role in MMP-14 trafficking and
facilitate cell migration after NNK stimulation.
In summary, NNK stimulation can enhance
the migration of human normal bronchial epithelial
cells and XB130 is a mediator for NNK-induced cell
migration through its translocation to cell motility related
microfilamentous cellular structures. This cellular process
may be required for repair of airway epithelium damaged
by cigarette smoking. However, extensive exposure to
cigarette smoking may lead to airway remodeling and
transformation of epithelial cells towards cancer cells.
Whether XB130 is involved in the pathogenesis and
progression of COPD and lung cancer merits further
investigation.

NNK-induced association of XB130 with
cortactin
Immunoprecipitation and immunostaining assays
revealed that after NNK stimulation, XB130 was associated
with another cytoplasmic protein, cortactin. Cortactin
is known to bind to F-actin once it is phosphorylated by
kinases [32]. Phosphorylated cortactin binds and recruits
actin-related protein 2/3 complex, which is necessary to
stimulate actin polymerization and branching in the fastgrowing “barbed” end of existing F-actin cytoskeleton,
especially in the actin cortex around the cell periphery
[33]. Cortactin has a classical SH3 domain, which usually
interacts with other cellular proteins by binding to prolinerich regions of the respective binding partners [34, 35].
XB130 has a proline-rich SH3 binding motif in the
N-terminal region, which may mediate interaction between
XB130 and cortactin. XB130 is a binding partner and an
activator of Src kinase [14]. Cortactin is also a partner of
Src kinase [36]. XB130 may enhance NNK-induced Src
activation and cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation. Through
interaction with cortactin, XB130 may promote actin
cytoskeleton rearrangement and cell migration.

XB130 and NNK-induced MMP-14 translocation
MMP-14 is involved in the remodelling of the ECM
in physiological as well as pathological processes [37].
MMP-14 has emerged as a central regulator of proteolytic
cell migration and invasion [38], which involves in the
regulated turnover of ECM components and participates in
the activation of secreted MMPs, such as pro-MMP-2 and
pro-MMP-13 [39]. MMP-14 concentrates at the leading
edge of various migrating cells after stimulation, and its
focusing at specific sites of the cell surface is determined
by interaction with other membrane proteins [37, 40]. In
this study, overexpression of XB130 promotes MMP-14
translocation to actin-rich cellular structures after NNK
stimulation. Recent studies show that vesicle-mediated
transport of MMP-14 plays a key role in the regulation
of surface-localised MMP-14 activity [41]. Regulators of
vesicle formation, transport and fusion are thus expected
to have a major impact on MMP-14 trafficking, and

with pre-cooled lysis buffer which contains 100 mmol/L
Tris-HCL buffer (pH 7.6, 100 mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L
EGTA, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L PMSF, 10 mmol/L
NaF, 2 mmol/L Na3VO4, 10 mmol/L β-glycerophosphate,
0.2 mmol/L ATP, 2% Triton X-100, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and
5 μg/ml leupeptin) with or without DNaseI (0.5 mg/ml)
on ice. After 15 min incubation at 4°C on a shaker, the
lysates were centrifuged at 10,000g at 4°C for 10 min.
The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000g at
4°C for 3 h to obtain soluble fraction and the membrane
cytoskeleton in the pellet. The pellet was washed three
times with lysis buffer and resuspended in 100 μl lysis
buffer. Equal volumes of 10,000g crude cytoskeleton
fraction (10,000g, pellet), 100,000g membranous skeleton
fraction (100,000g, pellet), and Triton-X soluble fraction
(100,000g, supernatant) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and
blotted with antibodies against XB130 and actin.

Immunofluorescence staining and
confocal imaging
Cells cultured on cover slips were fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. Cells were
permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min and
incubated with 5% donkey goat serum in PBS for 1 h to
block non-specific binding. Cells were incubated with
primary antibody for 2 h or overnight and subsequently
incubated with appropriate secondary antibody in PBS
for 30 min. Cells were stained with phalloidin for 20
min to detect F-actin. All the steps were done at room
temperature and cells were washed three times with PBS
between each step. Cells were mounted on coverslips with
Dako fluorescence mounting media. Images were captured
using inverted laser scanning fluorescence confocal
microscope (Olympus FluoView Confocal, FV1000-ASW,
60x oil objective) equipped with acquisition and analyses
software.

Western blotting
Cells were lysed using RIPA buffer (pH 7.5, 50
mmol/L Tris-HCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 100 mmol/L NaCl,
1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (20
μmol/L leupeptin, 0.8 μmol/L aprotinin, 10 μmol/L
pepstatin and 1.25 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride). Cell lysates were incubated on ice for 15 min
and centrifuged at 14, 000g for 10 min at 4°C. Total
protein in the supernatant was quantified using BCA
protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, ON,
Canada), and equal amount proteins were loaded for
SDS-PAGE. For western blots, proteins were transferred
from gels to nitrocellulose membranes using a Miniprotein
III electro blotter (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, ON, Canada).
Immunoblots were washed in PBS containing 0.1%
Tween-20 and then probed overnight at 4°C with primary
antibody. Membranes were washed and incubated for 30
min at 4°C with the secondary antibody. Bound antibodies
were detected using enhanced luminol and oxidizing
reagents (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg,
Germany).

Transfection and stable cell selection
Plasmid constructs of GFP alone, GFP-XB130,
GFP-XB130-ΔN, GFP-XB130-ΔC, GFP-XB130-ΔN/
ΔC, and GFP-XB130-ΔUR, have been described [21].
BEAS2B cells cultured in 6-well plates were transfected
with 1 μg of plasmids encoding the gene of interest,
using 3 μL of Fu Gene6™ transfection reagent (Roche
Diagnostics Canada, Laval, QC, Canada), according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. After 24 to 48 h incubation,
transfection reagents were removed and replaced with new
culture medium and maintained for 2 weeks. GFP positive
cells were sorted into 96-well plates containing DMEM
plus 30% FBS using MoFlo cell sorter (Dako Cytomation,
Carpinteria, CA, USA) and expanded.

Time-lapse microscopy of live cells

Cells cultured on glass coverslips were treated
with 0.1 μM NNK at 37°C for 30 min., and washed
twice with PBS. Then the cells were incubated in
PBS containing 4 μmol/L glycerol, 25 mmol/L PIPES,
1  mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, and 0.2% Triton
X-100, pH 6.9, at room temperature for 5 min, then
stained with phalloidin for 20 min to detect F-actin.

BEAS-2B cells were seeded onto LabTek 4 well
chamber slides and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 18 h
in normal DMEM culture media. Cells were washed with
PBS and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 1 h in phenol
red free DMEM culture media supplemented with 10%
FBS and 1 mg/mL penicillin and streptomycin. In an
environment chamber attached to a Zeiss Apotome (Carl
Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), live cell were imaged
using a 63x oil objective lens for 1 min. at four different
locations. The X, Y and Z coordinates at each location
were set in the Zeiss Zen Prosoftware. Cells were treated
with 0.1 μM NNK at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 15 min. Images
were captured every minute at each location. Images were
analysed using Zeiss Zen Pro.

Ultra-speed centrifugal preparation of
cytoskeleton fractions
Cytoskeletal fractions of the cells were prepared
with ultra-speed centrifugation [42]. In brief, cells were
grown to about 90% confluence, treated with 0.1 μM

Wound healing assay

Statistical analysis

Cell migration was assessed with wound healing
assays as previously described [43]. BEAS2B cells stably
expressing GFP alone or GFP-XB130 plated on coverslips
were cultured in 6-well tissue culture dishes.Confluent
cell layers were manually scratched with a micropipette
tip. Wells were rinsed once with PBS, replaced with new
DMEM containing 10% FBS and incubated at 37°C and
5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Images were captured
at 0, 4, 6, and 8 h after wounding using Nikon Eclipse
TE300 microscope. The wound distances from the
images were measured using Image J program. The ratio
of the final wound width to the width immediately after
scratching is indicated as percentage of closure.

Statistical significance was determined by Student’s
t-test or one-way ANOVA as appropriate, using GraphPad
Prism 5.0 software. The significance cut-off was set to P <
0.05. The values are denoted asmean ± S.D.
