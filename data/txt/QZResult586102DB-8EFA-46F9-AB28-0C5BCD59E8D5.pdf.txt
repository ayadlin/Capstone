cytotoxic T cells to very efficiently induce killing of target-positive
tumor cells in vitro and in various animal models (4–8). BiTE mode
of action involves formation of a regular cytolytic synapse (9),
serial killing of target cells by BiTE-activated, polyclonal effector
T cells (10), and a highly conditional T-cell activation leading to
T-cell proliferation, recharging of cytotoxic granule content, and
cytokine production (4, 11, 12).
One representative of the BiTE class is called MT110 (4), which
targets epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM; CD326). EpCAM is
widely expressed on most human adenocarcinoma and several
squamous cell carcinoma (13–15) and is present on cancer stem cells
of various carcinomas (16–18). MT110 and related antibodies have
been shown to eradicate established tumors in immunodeficient
mice at low microgram doses and to reactivate tumor-resident T
cells within human metastatic tissue leading to tumor rejection (4, 7,
19). MT110, which is in formal preclinical development, is specific for
human CD3 and human EpCAM, but with the exception of
chimpanzee, does not crossreact with its orthologs in other species.
Because the chimpanzee is no longer considered an appropriate
species for in vivo studies, we constructed for the present study a
biosimilar antibody called murine surrogate of MT110 (muS110)
with specificity for murine EpCAM and murine CD3 using rat and
hamster monoclonal antibodies, respectively. MuS110 is used to
principally assess safety and therapeutic window of an EpCAMspecific BiTE antibody in a relevant species.
Expression of EpCAM and CD3 in tissues from humans and mice
was found to be similar. MuS110 and MT110 had comparable
biological activities, and muS110 exhibited a significant therapeutic
window in mice. The murine EpCAM–specific BiTE antibody
muS110 therefore seems to distinguish between EpCAM expressed
on tumor and normal tissue, leading to a well-tolerated inhibition
of EpCAM-expressing tumors.

Abstract
EpCAM (CD326) is one of the most frequently and highly
expressed tumor-associated antigens known and recently has
also been found on cancer stem cells derived from human
breast, colon, prostate, and pancreas tumors. However, like
many other tumor-associated antigens used for antibodybased immunotherapeutic approaches, EpCAM is expressed
on normal tissues including epithelia of pancreas, colon, lung,
bile ducts, and breast. To assess the therapeutic window of an
EpCAM/CD3-bispecific single-chain antibody construct of the
bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) class, we constructed murine
surrogate of MT110 (muS110) from single-chain antibodies
specific for murine EpCAM and CD3 antigens. Immunhistochemical analysis showed that, with minor differences, the
expression of EpCAM protein on a large variety of tissues from
man and mouse was similar with respect to distribution and
level. MuS110 exhibited significant antitumor activity at as
low as 5 Mg/kg in both syngeneic 4T1 orthotopic breast cancer
and CT-26 lung cancer mouse models. Dosing of muS110
for several weeks up to 400 Mg/kg by intraanimal dose
escalation was still tolerated, indicating existence of a
significant therapeutic window for an EpCAM-specific BiTE
antibody in mice. MuS110 was found to have similar in vitro
characteristics and in vivo antitumor activity as MT110, a
human EpCAM/human CD3-bispecific BiTE antibody that
currently is in formal preclinical development. [Cancer Res

Introduction
A highly promising concept of treating malignant diseases is the
recruitment of cytotoxic T cells for tumor cell elimination using
bispecific antibody constructs (1, 2). Many different formats of
bispecific T-cell–recruiting antibodies have been developed
throughout the past two decades. One class of bispecific antibodies,
called ‘‘bispecific T-cell engager’’ (BiTE), is composed of two
covalently linked single-chain antibodies (scFv). Biological and
structural features of BiTE constructs have been defined in detail
(3). BiTE antibodies recognize with one single-chain antibody, a
subunit of the CD3 complex present on all T cells, and with the
second single-chain antibody, a tumor-associated cell surface
antigen. By simultaneously binding CD3-positive effector and
target antigen-positive tumor cells, BiTE antibodies redirect

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture. Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)-deficient
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, 4T1 cells, and B16F10 cells were
purchased from the American Type Cell Culture Collection. DHFR-deficient
CHO cells and B16F10 cells were transfected with an expression plasmid
coding for murine or human full-length EpCAM. CHO/muEpCAM and
CHO/huEpCAM cells were grown in suspension with HyQ medium
(HyClone), supplemented with 20 and 500 nmol/L methotrexate, respectively. 4T1 cells and B16F10/muEpCAM cells were grown in RPMI
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS (Invitrogen). All cells were
cultivated at 37jC in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. Subconfluent cultures
were detached by incubation with trypsin and checked for vitality by eosin
exclusion.
Construction and production of MT110 and muS110. MT110 was
engineered by recombinant DNA technology using an antibody specific for
human EpCAM and the antibody diL2K specific for human CD3 (4). To
generate muS110, the antibody mCD3-1 specific for murine CD3 and the

treatment groups versus the vehicle control group was performed using the
Student’s t test.
For the SW480 human colon xenograft model, 5  106 human PBMC
were mixed with 5  106 SW480 colon carcinoma cells (f540,000 EpCAM
binding sites/cell) in a final volume of 0.2 mL PBS, and the effector/target
cell mixture (E:T, 1:1) was s.c. injected into the right flank of NOD/SCID
mice. Six animals per group were i.v. treated with different doses (5 and
50 Ag/kg) of MT110 or PBS control vehicle starting 1 h after SW480/PBMC
inoculation, and treatment was repeated for 4 consecutive days.
For the orthotopic 4T1 murine breast carcinoma model, a mixture of
5  103 murine T cells and 2  104 4T1 tumor cells was inoculated in a total
volume of 50 AL RPMI without FCS into the mammary fat pad of 6 BALB/c
mice per group and animals were s.c. treated daily with either PBS or 15, 5,
1.5, or 0.5 Ag/kg muS110. Tumors were measured on the indicated days with
a caliper in two perpendicular dimensions, and tumor volumes were
calculated according to the formula: tumor volume = [(width2  length)/2].
For the CT-26 lung cancer model, 1  105 CT-26/muEpCAM tumor cells
were i.v. injected into the lateral tail vein of 8 to 12 BALB/c mice/group.
CT-26/muEpCAM tumor cells are trapped in the small pulmonary venules
around the alveoles of the lung where they form small tumor colonies on
the lung surface. From day 3 to day 17 after tumor cell inoculation,
animals were daily i.v. treated with PBS control buffer or different doses of
muS110 (0.5, 2, 5, and 12.5 Ag/injection or increasing doses from 12.5 to
400 Ag/injection, in which the original dose of 12.5 Ag/injection was
doubled every second day after the fourth injection). Thereafter, animals
were sacrificed and the number of CT-26/muEpCAM tumor cell colonies on
the lung surface was determined macroscopically. The observation period
was limited to 17 days for ethical reasons because of the severe effects of
high lung tumor burden on respiration.
Pharmacokinetic analyses. C57BL/6 mice were i.v. injected with 10 Ag/
mouse of either MT110 or muS110 and allocated to three or four different
groups of five mice each. Different groups were alternatingly bled at
different time points after MT110 administration (predose, 5, 15, 30 min and
1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h) and muS110 injection (predose, 5, 30 min and 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 h) and plasma concentrations quantified by
specific ELISAs.
For MT110 quantification, human EpCAM–coated ELISA plates (NUNC)
were incubated first with sheep anti-MT110 antibody (Micromet) followed
by rabbit anti-sheep and goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with alkaline
phosphatase (Sigma), each for 60 min at 25jC. For muS110 quantification,
murine EpCAM–coated ELISA plates were incubated first with biotinconjugated mouse antipentahistidine antibody (1:1,000; Qiagen) followed by
streptavidin conjugated with horse radish peroxidase (1:5,000; Dako) each
for 60 min at 25jC. Finally, plates were incubated with 100 AL of 3,3,5,5tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Sigma) for 60 min at 25jC. The reaction
was stopped by the addition of 50 AL 2N H2SO4 (Merck).
For both ELISAs, absorbance (405 nm) was read on Power WaveX select
(Bio-Tek instruments). Standard curves were fitted by four-variable analysis.
The corresponding absorbance value of one dilution that was within the
linear part of the standard curve was used to calculate the concentration of
MT110 and muS110, respectively. The limit of quantification of the method
was determined with f2 and 20 ng/mL for MT110 and muS110, respectively.
Pharmacokinetic calculations of MT110 and muS110 were performed
by the pharmacokinetic software package WinNonlin Professional 4.1
(Pharsight Corporation). Variables were determined by noncompartmental
analysis. The noncompartmental analysis was based on model 201 (i.v.
bolus injection). The distribution half-life (t1/2 a) was calculated using a loglinear regression of the first four and three sampling time points, whereas
the terminal elimination half-life (t1/2 h) was calculated by the last five or
six sampling time points with a measurable concentration of MT110 and
muS110.

antibody G8.8 specific for murine EpCAM were used. The sequences
encoding the variable domains of the respective antibodies were amplified
and modified as described (20). The coding sequences of the inserts were
verified by sequencing according to standard protocols (21). Expression
plasmids were transfected into DHFR-deficient CHO cells. Eukaryotic
protein expression in DHFR-deficient CHO cells was performed according
to Kaufman et al. (22). Transfected cells were expanded in tissue culture and
the constructs purified from cell culture supernatant of CHO cells as
described earlier (23–25).
Antibodies. A hybridoma producing rat anti-mouse EpCAM monoclonal
antibody G8.8 was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma
Bank, developed under the auspices of the National Institute of Child Health
and Human Resources, and maintained by the Department of Biological
Sciences (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). For scFv anti-EpCAM in MT110,
murine variable domains recognizing human EpCAM were obtained by
phage display. Variable domains of the mouse antihuman CD3 monoclonal
antibody L2K were subjected to a procedure removing human T helper cell
epitopes by point mutation of MHC class II anchor amino acids (26). This
resulted in deimmunized L2K (diL2K), which was used to construct MT110.
Nonspecific rat IgG2a or mouse IgG1 isotype control antibodies were
obtained from Serotech and Sigma Aldrich, respectively.
Saturation binding analysis. Saturation binding assays were performed
with CHO cells transfected with either human or murine EpCAM antigen or
CD3 enriched human or murine T cells [from peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMC) or spleen, respectively]. One hundred thousand cells per well
were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the respective antibody at
various concentrations. Staining was detected using a hexahistidine tag–
specific secondary antibody (Dianova) and an antimouse IgG–specific
labeled detection antibody (Sigma). Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde
solution (Merck). Binding was analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur
device and CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Equilibrium dissociation
constants (KD) values were determined using the nonlinear regression
function for binding curves integrated in Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.).
Cytotoxicity assay. Redirected T-cell cytotoxicity was analyzed by an
assay using human PBMC or murine splenocytes as effector cells (4). The
standard assay monitored uptake of propidium iodide by lysed cells using
flow cytometry with a FACSCalibur instrument (Becton Dickinson). Human
PBMC and mouse CD3 T cells were isolated as described earlier (8). CHO
cells transfected with either human or murine EpCAM served as target cells
for MT110 or muS110, respectively. The specific cytotoxicity was calculated
by the formula: [1-live target cells (sample)/live target cells (control)]  100.
Sigmoidal dose response curves typically had R2 values of >0.9 as
determined by Prism Software (GraphPad Software).
EpCAM protein expression in murine and human tissues. Immunohistochemical studies were contracted to Charles River Laboratories.
Sections of freshly frozen mouse and human tissues were fixed in acetone
for f10 min at room temperature and air dried. After blockade of
endogenous peroxidase and biotin, the primary antibody (i.e., G8.8, mCD3-1,
anti-human EpCAM, diL2K or respective rat IgG2a, and mouse IgG1 control
antibodies) was applied to the sections at 1.0 Ag/mL or 5.0 Ag/mL for
f25 min. Bound G8.8 or mCD3-1 were detected with a biotinylated rabbit
anti-rat IgG secondary antibody and bound antihuman EpCAM or diL2K
with a biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody. Bound
primary/secondary antibody complexes were visualized with a streptavidinbiotin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and a diaminobenzidine chromagen substrate. The slides were counterstained in hematoxylin, dehydrated
with alcohol to xylene, and coverslipped.
Animal studies. In vivo experiments were performed in 6- to 10-weekold immunocompetent BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratories) or
immunodeficient nonobese diabetes/severe combined immunodeficient
(NOD/SCID) mice (The Jackson Laboratory). NOD/SCID mice were tested
for leakiness of immunodeficiency and only mice with IgG levels below
100 ng/mL were used. All experiments were performed according to the
German Animal Protection Law with permission from the responsible local
authorities. In compliance with the Animal Protection Law, mice had to be
euthanized when tumor volumes exceeded 10% of their body weight.

human T cells, and MT110 could not lyse murine EpCAM–
expressing CHO cells in the presence of human T cells. This high
specificity was confirmed in the reciprocal experiment using CHO
cells expressing human EpCAM (Fig. 2B). The half-maximum
activity of redirected lysis of MT110 [50% growth inhibition (EC50)
value] in the human system was at a concentration of 0.65 F 0.5
ng/mL MT110 (n = 5). The EC50 value of muS110 in the murine
system was at 2.51 F 1.2 ng/mL muS110 (n = 10).
Experiments using the human mammary carcinoma cell line
MDA-MB-453 (expressing human EpCAM) in combination with
human PBMC and MT110, and the murine mammary carcinoma
cell line 4T1 (expressing murine EpCAM) in combination with
muS110 and murine T cells gave similar EC50 values compared with
EpCAM-transfected CHO cells as target cells (data not shown).
Similar EpCAM protein expression in murine and human
tissues and cells. Human and murine tissues were analyzed for
expression of EpCAM and CD3 by immunohistochemical staining
with the parental monoclonal antibodies used to construct muS110
and MT110. Staining specificity was controlled by respective
isotype control antibodies. The anti-CD3 mAbs predominantly
stained murine and human lymphoid tissues, respectively.
Occasional other tissue staining could be explained by the presence
of infiltrated T lymphocytes. The expression pattern of EpCAM in
multiple murine and human tissues was largely overlapping and
primarily seen on epithelial cells (Table 1). Figure 3 shows examples
for the EpCAM staining of human and murine pancreas and
prostate tissues. In both species, EpCAM staining patterns were
largely confined to the cell surface, showed no difference with
respect to polarized expression on epithelial cells, and stained a
similar proportion of cells in tissues (data not shown). Brain and
endothelium of murine and human origin did not show any

antibody (mAb) mCD3-1] and murine EpCAM (rat mAb G8.8). Both
antibodies showed no crossreactivity with other rodent orthologs
tested (data not shown). MuS110 had its four variable domains
aligned in the same orientation and by using linkers of the same
length and composition as MT110 (4). MuS110 was purified from
cell culture media of a CHO cell clone by the same procedure as
used for MT110 (4). Both constructs have in their COOH terminus a
hexahistidine tag for purification and antibody detection. Monomeric forms of muS110 and MT110 were isolated and used for
further characterization.
MT110 and muS110 have similar EpCAM but distinct CD3
binding affinities. Saturation binding curves and equilibrium
binding constants for MT110 and muS110 for their respective
antigens were determined using human and murine EpCAM
cDNA–transfected CHO cell lines and purified human and murine
T cells, respectively (Fig. 1). CHO cell lines expressing human and
murine EpCAM had approximately the same surface antigen density, 1.0  106 binding sites per cell for CHO-huEpCAM and
1.2  106 binding sites per cell for CHO-muEpCAM. Computational
analysis revealed KD for EpCAM binding of muS110 and MT110
of 2.1 F 0.26  10 8 mol/L (n = 7) and 1.3 F 0.25  10 8 mol/L
(n = 4), respectively. KD values for CD3 binding to purified T cells
were 2.9 F 0.4 x 10 9 mol/L for muS110 (n = 5) and 1.0 F 0.15
 10 7 mol/L (n = 11) for MT110. Although EpCAM binding affinity
of muS110 and MT110 was very similar, the affinity of muS110 for
mouse CD3 was 35-fold higher than that of MT110 for human CD3.
MT110 and muS110 show highly specific redirected lysis of
respective target cells. Dose-dependent redirected lysis of murine
EpCAM–expressing CHO cells was only observed when murine
T cells and the murine-specific BiTE muS110 were combined in the
cell culture assay (Fig. 2A). MuS110 was completely ineffective with

Pharmacokinetics of MT110 and muS110. Pharmacokinetic
variables were determined in C57BL/6 mice after i.v. administration of 10 Ag MT110 or 10 Ag muS110. Serum concentrations of
MT110 and muS110 were quantified by specific ELISAs. Peak
plasma and serum concentrations of MT110 and muS110 were
detected 5 min after bolus injection and reached the lower limit of
quantification of 2 and 20 ng/mL, respectively, within f8 to 10 h.
t1/2 a were 0.34 and 0.17 h, and t1/2 h were 1.88 and 5.13 h for
MT110 and muS110, respectively.
MuS110 efficacy and toxicity in an orthotopic breast cancer
model. Given the restricted species specificity of MT110 and
muS110, no direct comparison for efficacy of the two BiTE
antibodies was possible in the same mouse model. MT110 requires
an immunodeficient model in which human T cells are mixed with
tumor cells expressing human EpCAM. MuS110 can be tested in an
immunocompetent mouse model and, depending on the syngeneic
tumor cell line, no extra expression of murine EpCAM is required.
Consistent with earlier data (4), MT110 showed high antitumor
activity in a human colon SW480 xenograft model (Fig. 4A).
Although five daily i.v. injections of 5 Ag/kg MT110 significantly
reduced tumor growth, 50 Ag/kg MT110 led to a complete
inhibition of tumor growth. At the higher dose, four of six animals
were still free of tumor on day 26 after tumor cell inoculation, and
the other two showed very small tumors with diameters of 0.06 and
0.01 cm3. As shown elsewhere (7), a nonspecific BiTE or T cells
alone showed no antitumor activity in this animal model.
In the 4T1 orthotopic breast cancer model, daily s.c. treatment
with 5 or 15 Ag/kg muS110 starting at day 0 induced a dosedependent retardation of tumor growth (Fig. 4B). Although 0.5 and
1.5 Ag/kg muS110 were not effective, 5 Ag/kg was slightly more
effective than 15 Ag/kg. Reduction of tumor volume on day 30 was
82% after treatment with 5 Ag/kg and 68% after treatment with
15 Ag/kg. Although all animals developed tumors, 1 of 6 animals in
the 15 Ag/kg and 2 of 6 animals in the 5 Ag/kg dose group had
tumors with a size below 0.1 cm3 at the end of the study.
S.c. treatment with muS110 induced mild dose dependent side
effects. Only the highest dose group (15 Ag/kg) showed a transient
loss of body weight on day 2 (after the first two injections), which
normalized on the third day (Fig. 4C). Skin irritations occurred at
the area of injection at all dose levels, and scar tissue developed at
about 7 days after start of treatment. After the third week of
treatment, all side effects had vanished. Doses of 50 Ag/kg and
higher showed a cytokine release syndrome in mice that prevented
prolonged treatment periods.
MuS110 efficacy and toxicity in a CT-26 lung cancer model.
The in vivo activity and toxicity of muS110 was further assessed in
the CT-26 lung tumor model. Daily i.v. treatment with muS110
starting from day 3 after tumor cell inoculation led to a significant
and dose-dependent inhibition of lung tumor colony formation
(Fig. 5A and B). Although treatment with 0.5 Ag/kg did only show a
6.7% reduction of lung tumor colonies, treatment with 2 or 5 Ag/kg
led to a 38.9% and 50.6% reduction, respectively. Treatment with
12.5 Ag/kg muS110 reduced the number of lung tumor colonies by
56%. With a reduction of 63%, the strongest effect was seen in
the intraanimal dose escalation group (12.5–400 Ag/kg muS110).
Side effects in the highest dose groups such as loss of bodyweight,
diarrhea, and mild sedation/excitation were only transient. The
loss in body weight was f5% to 7.5% and only seen after the first
two injections with a rapid recovery and normalization thereafter
(Fig. 5C). In the lower dose groups, no such treatment related side
effects were observed.

Figure 2. In vitro efficacy of muS110 and MT110 in redirected target cell
lysis. A, in vitro efficacy of muS110. Redirected lysis of CHO cells transfected
with murine EpCAM was tested with murine CD3 cell–enriched splenocytes in
the presence of increasing BiTE concentrations during a 48-h assay period.
B, in vitro efficacy of MT110. Redirected lysis of CHO cells transfected with
human EpCAM was tested with human PBMC in the presence of increasing BiTE
concentrations during a 48-h assay period. In both experiments, effector and
target cells were mixed at an effector-to-target ratio of 10:1. Points, mean; bars,
SE of triplicate measurements. Cell lysis was assessed via a FACS-based
cytotoxicity assay as described in Materials and Methods. Mu T cells, murine
T cells; Hu T cells, human T cells.

EpCAM expression. Human epithelia of breast, bladder, colon,
intestine, kidney, bile ducts, lung, pancreas, pituitary, prostate,
thyroid, and uterus all expressed EpCAM and so did all respective
murine tissues (Table 1). Likewise, certain tissues were not stained
with either human or murine EpCAM–specific mAbs, including
bone marrow, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, endothelium, heart,
ovary, spinal chord, spleen, and striated muscle. The only
differences in EpCAM expression between man and mouse were
noted for adrenal gland and testis tissues, which were stained in
human but apparently not in murine tissue samples. When the
analysis was extended to peripheral blood cells using fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, a fraction of murine B and
T cells was found to express EpCAM, whereas no expression of
EpCAM was detectable on human peripheral lymphocytes (data
not shown).

NOTE: Sections of fresh frozen mouse and human tissues were stained as described in Materials and Methods. All slides were evaluated by a certified

Discussion

and cyclins (34). Likewise, blockade of EpCAM expression in
human breast cancer cell lines by specific siRNA inhibited
proliferation, migration, and invasiveness of cells (35). These
recent findings suggest that EpCAM plays an important role in
human cancers, supporting its use as immunotherapeutic target for
the eradication of both differentiated and pluripotent cancer cells.
Like most other tumor-associated antigens used for targeted
therapies, including HER-2, epidermal growth factor receptor,
carcinoembryonic antigen, CD20, or CD52, EpCAM is also
expressed on normal cells and tissues. Staining of many normal
epithelia by EpCAM antibodies raised early on concerns about a
therapeutic window (36), which seemed only based on an
overexpression of EpCAM on tumor relative to normal tissue.
Overexpression of EpCAM relative to parental tissue is indeed the

EpCAM (CD326) is expressed at high level and with high
frequency on differentiated cancer cells of most human adenocarcinoma and certain squamous cell carcinoma (13, 14, 27–29).
A number of studies have recently used anti-EpCAM antibodies
for isolation of so-called cancer stem cells from human breast,
colon, pancreas, and prostate tumor tissues (16–18, 30), indicating
that EpCAM is also expressed on cancer stem cells. This may relate
to the findings that overall survival prognosis of several human
cancers negatively correlates with expression of EpCAM (29,
31–33), and that overexpressed EpCAM behaves like an oncogene
inducing in quiescent cells proliferation, growth factor independence, colony fomation in soft agar, and up-regulation of c-myc

EpCAM-expressing organs. What could be the basis for a
differential recognition by a bispecific antibody of EpCAM on
tumor cells versus the EpCAM abundantly expressed on normal
tissues?
A number of recent studies have shown that EpCAM on normal
epithelial cells is in complex with other proteins in the plasma
membrane within so-called tetraspanin webs. Protein partners of
EpCAM include tetraspanins CD9 and 14.1, claudin 7, and CD44
(42–44). These protein-protein interactions may reduce the
accessibility of EpCAM on the surface of normal tissue and leave
only few epitopes for recognition by antibodies. Upon neoplastic
transformation, EpCAM can be overexpressed on certain tumor
cells, which may titrate out protein partners. Likewise, free EpCAM
may arise from loss of protein partners during transformation, as
has been reported for CD9 (45). Accessibility of EpCAM-expressing
cells to both antibodies and immune effector cells may further
increase upon degradation of extracellular matrix by tumor cell–
derived proteases and by loss of tight junctions in tumor tissue. In
support for a sequestration of EpCAM in normal epithelia,
immunohistochemical studies showed that EpCAM is concentrated
within intercellular boundaries, whereas it is evenly distributed
on the surface of tumor cells (46). There may in fact be three

case for breast (35) and ovarian cancers (37) but, for instance, is
not evident for colon cancer. Acute pancreas toxicity was induced
by two monoclonal antibodies tested in clinical phase I studies
(38, 39), suggesting accessibility of EpCAM on normal pancreas
tissue by the antibodies. On the other hand, two other anti-EpCAM
antibodies showed good tolerability in man, suggesting differences
in EpCAM antigen recognition by the various antibodies (40, 41).
For development of a T-cell–recruiting anti-EpCAM BiTE antibody,
it was therefore important to establish an animal model in which
both efficacy and toxicology of this novel therapeutic approach can
be principally assessed.
In the present study, we have observed that a BiTE antibody
with specificity for murine CD3 and murine EpCAM had a robust
therapeutic window in mice, leading to potent control of tumor
growth with no significant or irreversible effect on clinical
variables of animals. A detailed toxicology study is ongoing in
which muS110 BiTE doses up to 500 Ag/kg are being tested that
are by far exceeding the efficacious doses in the range of 2.5 to
10 Ag/kg identified in the present study. Preliminary analysis of
immunologic and histopathologic variables suggests that doselimiting toxicities of muS110 in mice at doses of 100 Ag/kg and
above are related to cytokine release rather than damage to

as the corresponding isotype matched control antibodies were used at a concentration of 10 Ag/mL, and EpCAM expression was evaluated by immunohistochemical
staining of bound antibodies. Isotype ctrl, isotype control.

Murine-Specific EpCAM BiTE

How transferable are safety results obtained with muS110 in
mice to the human EpCAM/CD3-bispecific BiTE antibody MT110
in humans? Transferability relies on both the comparability of
muS110 and MT110 in terms of biological activity and of EpCAM
expression in man and mouse. To the extent possible, muS110 was
constructed to yield structural, biochemical, and biological
characteristics similar to those of drug candidate MT110. After
all, distinct antibodies had to be used for generation of muS110
and MT110, and the comparison of the two BiTE antibodies is

5 or 50 Ag/kg MT110 or with PBS control vehicle for 5 consecutive d starting
1 h after tumor inoculation. **, highly significant differences (P < 0.0005)

group, and tumor size was measured daily. Mice were daily s.c. treated with 15,
5, 1.5, or 0.5 Ag/kg muS110 or PBS control vehicle starting 1 h after tumor
inoculation. C, body weight of muS110-treated BALB/c mice during treatment.

levels contributing to a differential recognition of EpCAM: (a) a
molecular level, where accessibility of certain EpCAM epitopes
is controlled by protein partners; (b) a cellular level, where
EpCAM is sequestered at least in part by its subcellular distribution
within highly structured normal epithelium; and (c) a tissue level,
where access of immune effector cells to epithelium is diminished
by intact extracellular matrix. Future research is required to investigate these various possibilities and determine their contribution to
a therapeutic window as seen with some but not all EpCAM-directed
therapeutic approaches.

comparable EpCAM expression in man and mouse. A key difference
was EpCAM expression on mouse lymphocytes, which was not seen
on human lymphocytes. As reported for the B-lymphocyte–specific
BiTE antibody MT103 in chimpanzee, the immediate encounter of
T cells and B target cells in blood can cause transient cytokine
release by MT103 (47). This may be less pronounced with a BiTE
targeting localized EpCAM target in tumor tissue. The 35-fold
higher affinity of muS110 for the murine CD3 ortholog and the
species-specific expression of EpCAM on murine lymphocytes may
rather enhance the toxicity profile of muS110 in relation to MT110.
However, only a careful dose-escalation clinical phase I study will
ultimately determine the tolerability of MT110 in humans. The
present data with muS110 are nevertheless encouraging and suggest
that a therapeutic window may also exist for EpCAM-directed BiTE
antibodies administered to man.

hampered by the use of different effector cells and target cells,
and a pronounced species difference.
The affinity of muS110 and MT110 for EpCAM was almost
identical, but muS110 did bind more avidly to CD3 than MT110.
Although this may increase the risk of nonconditional T-cell
activation by muS110, it apparently did not positively affect the
potency of redirected lysis by muS110. If anything, MT110 was
more potent with human T cells than muS110 with murine
splenocytes in redirected lysis of human or mouse EpCAM–
expressing CHO target cells, respectively. Control of tumor growth
in respective mouse models was achieved by muS110 and MT110 at
similar doses, suggesting that the two BiTE antibodies had rather
comparable biological activities in vivo. At present, we do not know
whether muS110 and MT110 recognize the same domain on their
respective EpCAM orthologs and whether possible differences
matter for a therapeutic window.
With respect to EpCAM expression, a significant overlap was
found between mouse and human tissues. The parental antiEpCAM antibodies used for muS110 and MT110 stained most
critical organs with similar intensity. In particular, pancreas, a
critical organ for toxicity of anti-EpCAM antibody, showed
