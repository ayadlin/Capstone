BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to determine whether amifostine is effective in reducing the
toxicities associated with the administration of platinum-containing regimens in children with hepatoblastoma
(HB). METHODS: Patients were enrolled on P9645 beginning in March of 1999. Patients who had stage I/II
disease received treatment with 4 cycles of combined cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and vincristine (C5V) with or
without amifostine. Patients who had stage III/IV disease were randomized to receive treatment with 6
cycles of either C5V with or without amifostine or carboplatin alternating with cisplatin (CC) with or without amifostine. Patients who were randomized to receive amifostine were given a dose of 740 mg/m2 intravenously over 15 minutes before each administration of a platinum agent. RESULTS: Eighty-two patients
were considered in a special interim analysis of the incidence of toxicity. The disease outcome for patients
who received amifostine was similar to the outcome for patients who did not receive amifostine (P ¼.22).
The incidence of significant hearing loss (>40 dB) was similar for patients who did or did not receive amifostine (38% [14 of 37 patients] vs 38% [17 of 45 patients], respectively; P ¼.68). There were no differences
in the incidence of renal or bone marrow toxicities evaluated. Patients who received amifostine had a
higher incidence of hypocalcemia (5% vs 0.5%; P ¼.00006). CONCLUSIONS: Amifostine in the doses and
schedule used in this study failed to significantly reduce the incidence of platinum-induced toxicities in

Amifostine for Hepatoblastoma/Katzenstein et al

KEY WORDS: hepatoblastoma, amifostine, hearing, ototoxicity.

Cisplatin is 1 of the most effective agents against hepatoblastoma (HB), and the addition of this agent to HB treatment protocols in the mid-1980s by both the Pediatric
Oncology Group (POG) and the Children’s Cancer Group
(CCG) resulted in dramatically improved survival rates for
these children.1,2 Cisplatin, however, is associated with significant toxicity, including hearing loss, myelosuppression,
and nephrotoxicity.3 Carboplatin also has been used in an
effort to provide antitumor efficacy with another platinum
agent that has less potential toxicity.4,5
Amifostine is an agent that was developed to selectively protect normal tissues from the cytotoxic effects of
radiation and chemotherapy. Adult studies have demonstrated the ability of amifostine to reduce toxicity without
altering outcome or therapeutic efficacy.6,7 The Children’s Oncology Group (COG) Study P9645 was designed
to determine whether the intensification of platinum
administered therapy could improve survival in newly
diagnosed patients with HB and to determine whether
amifostine could prevent platinum-associated toxicities,
including hearing loss, renal dysfunction, and myelosuppression. This report describes the results of amifostine
use and its effects in reducing ototoxicity associated with
the administration of platinum-containing regimens in
children with HB.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
The Pediatric Intergroup Hepatoblastoma Study P9645
opened in March 1999. The study was designed as a factorial
randomization for patients with stage III or IV disease. The
details of the study are illustrated in Figure 1. Patients were
eligible for study entry if they were aged <21 years of age at
diagnosis; had biopsy-proven, previously untreated HB; and
had adequate organ function documented at the time of
study enrollment. The protocol was approved by the
National Cancer Institute and by the individual institutional
review board requirements of the participating COG-affiliated institutions. Informed consent was obtained for all
patients before study entry. Randomization to carboplatin/

cisplatin (CC) was suspended in January 2002, because the
projected improvement in long-term outcome associated
with CC was excluded statistically as a possible outcome of
this trial.8 Subsequently, all patients were assigned to receive
combined cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and vincristine (C5V)
with or without amifostine.
Treatment
Patients were treated according to the schema illustrated
in Figure 1. Patients with tumors of pure fetal histology
were observed after undergoing surgical resection without
further therapy. Patients who had stage I (nonpure fetal
histology) and stage II disease received 4 cycles of C5V
with or without amifostine. Patients who had stage III
and stage IV disease were randomized to receive 6 cycles
of either C5V or CC with or without amifostine. Each
cycle of C5V consisted of intravenous (iv) CDDP (100
mg/m2 or 3 mg/kg for patients <1 year) administered
over 4 hours, followed by iv hydration on Day 1, 5-FU
(600 mg/m2 iv push) on Day 3 and VCR (1.5 mg/m2 iv
push) on Days 3, 10, and 17. Each cycle of CC was comprised of carboplatin at a dose of 700 mg/m2 given iv over
1 hour (23 mg/kg for patients who weighed <10 kg) on
Day 0 (560 mg/m2 or 18.5 mg/kg for patients who
weighed <10 kg after 2 cycles) followed by cisplatin at a
dose of 100 mg/m2 or 3 mg/kg for patients aged <1 year
on Day 14 administered as described above. Granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor was given after each CC
cycle. Amifostine was given at a dose of 740 mg/m2 over
15 minutes immediately before cisplatin. The total
intended platinum dose for patients with stage I (nonpure
fetal) and stage II disease was 400 mg/m2 (12 mg/kg for
patients aged <1 year) of cisplatin. The total intended
platinum dose for patients with stage III and IV disease
was 600 mg/m2 of cisplatin (18 mg/kg for patients aged
<1 year) and 3640 mg/m2 of carboplatin (120 mg/kg for
patients who weighed <10 kg). Patients who had a glomerular filtration rate with a glomerular filtration rate
<100 mL/minute/1.73 m2 were supposed to have their
carboplatin dose calculated using the Calvert formula to
achieve an area under the curve of 6. Patients were re5829

delays in therapy >1 week or who experienced fever and
neutropenia were allowed to receive granulocyte–colonystimulating factor (5 lg/kg daily) beginning 24 hours
after the 5-fluorouracil dose. Patients who experienced
grade 4 neurotoxicity had their vincristine withheld until
symptoms resolved; then, their therapy was reinstituted at
half the initial dose. No specific modifications in therapy
were made for any decrease in hearing.

evaluated at the end of the initial chemotherapy phase of 4
cycles. Patients who had unresectable disease at that time
were considered treatment failures, whereas patients who
underwent tumor resection received 2 more cycles of the
therapy to which they initially had been randomized.
Evaluation of Therapy
Physical examination, blood counts, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels, appropriate imaging studies (including
computed tomography scans of the chest and either a computed tomography scan or a magnetic resonance image of
the abdomen), and assessment of audiologic function
(audiogram or auditory brainstem responses) were performed before therapy. Subsequent examinations and AFP
assays were done before every additional cycle of chemotherapy. AFP levels were supposed to be monitored monthly for
6 months, then every 2 months until 2 years off therapy,
then every 3 months until 4 years off therapy, and then
yearly. Imaging studies were repeated after Cycles 2, 4, and
6 and then at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 12 months,
18 months, and 24 months off therapy. Audiologic examination was repeated after the fourth cycle of chemotherapy,
at the end of therapy, and yearly after therapy.
Toxicity of Treatment
The individual incidents of various toxicities were graded
on a scale from 1 to 4 according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 2.0 (CTC). Limits for toxicity grades were dependent on both patient age
and the particular organ system involved. The specific tox5830

Patients were randomized after the initial surgical
procedure. Patients were stratified according to disease
stage (stage I or II vs stage III or IV). Patients who had
stage I/II disease were assigned randomly to receive or not
receive amifostine. Patients who had stage III/IV disease
were assigned randomly to receive C5V or CC and to
receive or not receive amifostine. The primary outcome
measure for the effect of chemotherapy and amifostine
randomization was event-free survival. The intention of
the study was to enroll patients for 5.5 years and to follow
the last patient for 3 years after enrollment.
In November 2003, an analysis of toxicity was performed using toxicity data provided by the routine data
collection done by institutional investigators according to
the CTC criteria. At that time, the rate of grade 3 or 4 ototoxicity according to institutional reporting was 4%. Data
from other authors9,10 using information derived from
expert review of serial audiograms demonstrated that
quantifying ototoxicity from the CTC criteria substantially underestimated the true incidence of significant
hearing loss. In response to these observations, we conducted a retrospective assessment of hearing loss in a subgroup of patients enrolled on the study (the ‘‘evaluation
cohort’’). A blinded, detailed review of ototoxicity using
results from audiograms that were obtained as part of
toxicity evaluations, as directed by the protocol, was performed by 1 of the authors (K.W.C.), who compared
auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and/or audiogram
data (‘‘hearing evaluation’’) obtained before the start of
treatment with data obtained after all therapy was completed. The evaluation cohort was comprised of any

All data current to March 31, 2003 were used to establish
which patients fit the criteria for inclusion in the evaluation cohort.
If >1 post-therapy hearing evaluation was available,
then the evaluation that was done closest to March 31,
2003 was used. Modified Brock criteria11 (Table 1) were
used to assign a rating of hearing loss for each ear.

Analytic methods

An analysis was conducted using the lowest grade of
hearing loss observed in either ear (‘‘best ear’’). The
randomized assignment to receive amifostine was stratified by disease stage, and most patients in Stratum 2 also
were randomized to receive 1 of 2 chemotherapy regimens. To account for these stratification factors, a log-linear model was used to assess whether significant hearing
loss, defined as the presence of grade 2A hearing loss in
the patient’s best ear, was associated with the randomized
amifostine assignment after adjustment for stage (stages
I and II vs stages III and IV) or treatment regimen (CC vs
C5V).12

Other toxicities

Each course of protocol therapy that was received by
a randomized patient who had enrolled by the cutoff date
was evaluated by the institutional investigator for the presence of all toxicities and was reported using CTC version
2 criteria. The incidence of each type of toxicity was calculated as the number of courses during which the toxicity
was noted divided by the number of courses administered.
These rates were compared across randomized regimens
using the exact conditional test of proportions.13
Outcome definitions

To assess the relation between amifostine and outcome, patients who were randomized and who enrolled by
the cutoff date were considered. Event-free survival was
defined as the period from the date chemotherapy was
started until evidence of an event (progressive disease, death,
diagnosis of a second malignant neoplasm) or date of last
contact, whichever occurred first. Patients who did not experience an event were censored on the date of last contact.
Life-table estimates were calculated according to the
method of Kaplan and Meier,14 and the standard deviation of the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survivor function
at selected points was calculated using the Greenwood
formula.14 For treatment comparisons, outcome was
assigned to the randomized treatment, regardless of the
therapy received.

Two hundred eighty-nine patients were enrolled on
P9645. A detailed description of the results of this trial are
published elsewhere.15 Of this total, 120 patients comprised the evaluation cohort, as described earlier (Fig. 2).
Audiologic data were interpreted by a pediatric otologist
(K.W.C.) and were categorized as evaluable if there was
enough information to determine accurately whether or
not ototoxicity had occurred. Eighty-two patients had sufficient audiologic data that made them fully evaluable for
an analysis of ototoxicity. The demographic and treatment data of the evaluation cohort are detailed in Table 2.
Amifostine did not prevent ototoxicity. Thirty-one
of 82 evaluable patients (38%) had noticeable hearing loss
(grade  2A). Two of 21 patients with stage I/II disease
(10%) had grade 2A hearing loss, whereas 29 of 61
patients with stage III/IV disease (48%) had grade 2A
hearing loss (Table 3). Six patients (7%) had correctable
hearing deficits with hearing aids, and 2 patients (2%)
had hearing deficits that could not be corrected completely even with hearing aids. There was no relation
between noticeable hearing loss and amifostine assignment after adjustment for disease stage and chemotherapy
treatment arm (P ¼ .68) (Table 4). Specifically, amifostine did not prevent hearing loss of any grade. Chemotherapy assignment was not related to hearing loss
(P ¼ .75), but patients who had stage III/IV disease were
more likely to have experienced hearing loss than patients
who had stage I/II disease (P ¼ .002). Patients with stage
III/IV disease were to receive 2 more cycles of chemotherapy than patients with stage I/II disease.
Of the 38 patients who were excluded from the audiologic analysis, 15 did not have a post-treatment evaluation,

and 11 did not have data of sufficient quality to evaluate.
Twelve patients had detectable hearing loss but had conductive rather than sensorineural hearing loss, which prevented
attribution of the loss to protocol therapy and, thus, made
them inevaluable for therapy-related ototoxicity.
The vast majority of patients had behavioral audiometric data. In total, 44 patients had hearing evaluated by
ABR. However, only tone-burst threshold ABRs were
considered evaluable and were performed in 11 patients;
whereas 25 patients were not included in the analysis,
because they were evaluated using nonfrequency-specific,
click-evoked ABRs, which do not specifically test for high
frequency hearing loss from ototoxicity. Eight patients
who had nonthreshold ABRs, which typically are used to
test neural latencies, also were excluded from the analysis
as invalid clinical assessments of ototoxicity.
The frequencies of renal toxicities (proteinuria, hemoglobinuria, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and hypomagnesiumia) and bone marrow toxicities (need for
transfusion, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia)
were not different for patients who did or did not receive
amifostine (Table 5). However, the use of amifostine was
associated with a higher incidence of hypocalcemia (5% vs
0.5%; P ¼ .00006). The use of amifostine was not related
significantly to the risk of an adverse event (Fig. 3).

DISCUSSION
Previous data suggested that amifostine could provide
protection against treatment-related toxicities associated
with the administration of cisplatin and provided the
Cancer

December 15, 2009

background rationale for the current trial.6,7,16,17 This
prospective, randomized trial failed to yield any evidence
that amifostine could protect any degree of hearing loss,
because 38% of patients experienced noticeable hearing
loss, and 57% of patients experienced any measurable decrement in hearing. This is important, in that even mild
hearing loss may have a significant impact on children
with HB who are at a crucial age of cognitive development. These results are similar to those reported in several
other pediatric series. A report by Marina et al revealed
significant hearing loss in 18 of 24 patients with germ cell
tumors who received high-dose cisplatin and amifostine.9
Fisher et al administered amifostine before cisplatin to 11
patients with medulloblastoma, and ototoxicity developed
in 7 of 9 evaluable patients.18 Petrilli and coworkers
randomized 39 patients with osteosarcoma to receive amifostine before cisplatin therapy, and observed no difference in the incidence of hearing toxicity.19 However, a
recent publication by Fouladi et al described children
with average-risk medulloblastoma who had a reduced
risk of hearing loss in the group of patients who received
amifostine.20 It is interesting to note that all of those
patients had all been irradiated previously and had
received amifostine both before and in the middle of the
cisplatin infusion. The disparity in the results from these
trials and others may be explained by differences in several
factors, including patient age, individual and cumulative
platinum dosage, timing and dosage of amifostine, tumor
site, and potential interaction with other treatment
modalities. Other agents, such as sodium thiosuflate and
n-acetylcysteine, have been and continue to be evaluated
as potential otoprotective compounds.

Historic data demonstrate that anywhere from 5%
to 75% of patients may experience hearing loss after
treatment with cisplatin.9,10 Audiologic toxicity collected
using the usual clinical trials mechanism, by the submission of grading information by the institutional investigator using CTC criteria, underestimated the true
incidence of noticeable significant hearing loss (4% vs
38%) in this population, as demonstrated in the current
analysis. In addition, although the analysis of audiologic
data was possible only for 82 of 120 (68%) of potentially
evaluable patients because of incomplete data, the evaluated cohort is a representative group that justifies the
conclusion that amifostine was not otoprotective for this
5834

group of patients. Specific guidelines on how to administer audiograms or Brainstem Auditory Evoked Response
tests were not part of the protocol.
Therefore, future pediatric trials that attempt to evaluate ototoxicity must be written with more stringent criteria for exactly which tests should be used and exactly how
they should be performed. A separate article is in preparation as part of this endeavor that will detail pitfalls in data
collection from this and other cooperative group studies
and will make recommendations for more specific criteria
to be included in future protocols. From the current experience, we suggest that the inclusion of otolaryngologists,
audiologists, or others with the appropriate training and

expertise is crucial in both study design and analysis so that
the resulting data are both valid and reliable.
In the current study, the cytoprotective agent amifostine was administered in an effort to decrease platinum-induced toxicity without adversely affecting eventfree or overall survival. However, in the doses and schedule used, amifostine did not protect against the ototoxicity
associated with platinum agents. In addition, renal and
bone marrow toxicity also were not ameliorated by the use
of amifostine. The use of amifostine concomitantly with
platinum therapy did not have an impact on the outcomes
of children with HB (Fig. 3). Amifostine was associated
with a much higher incidence of hypocalcemia, which is a
well known side effect of this agent.
