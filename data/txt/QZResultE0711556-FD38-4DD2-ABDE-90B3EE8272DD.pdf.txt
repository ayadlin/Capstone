BACKGROUND. Clinicopathological features and outcome of women with endometrioid and serous ovarian adenocarcinoma were compared.

METHODS. Between 1984 and 2004, baseline and follow-up data were prospectively recorded on 1545 patients with ovarian cancer. Of these, 270 had pure
endometrioid tumors; 659 had pure serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary.
Response to platinum-based chemotherapy (PBC) overall survival, stage-for-stage
median progression-free survival (PFS), and cause-specific median survival were
compared. Independent predictors of survival were examined by using multivariate analyses.

debulked overall (71% vs 45%; P < .001), but there was no difference according to
but median PFS was better for patients with endometrioid tumors (24 months vs
13 months; P < .0001) as was overall median survival (48 months vs 22 months;
P < .0001). This relation remained for stage II and III disease and for moderately
and poorly differentiated tumors. Patients with concurrent endometrioid ovarian
and endometrial malignancies had a survival advantage compared with those
with ovarian malignancies alone. Independent predictors of survival after PBC
were histological type, debulking status, and disease stage.

CONCLUSIONS. Despite similar PBC response rates, endometrioid histology is
associated with better survival compared with serous adenocarcinoma of the
ovary, even with stage III or poorly differentiated tumors. Cancer 2008;112:2211–

pithelial ovarian cancers are a conglomerate of histopathologically defined entities thought to arise from the ovarian surface
epithelium. There has been a lack of publications that specifically
address differences in the natural history and distribution of these
subtypes. In general, studies have shown that compared with serous
adenocarcinoma of the ovary, clear cell carcinoma,1 mucinous carcinoma,2 and carcinosarcoma3 of the ovary all have a poorer prognosis and relative platinum insensitivity. Very few studies have looked
specifically at endometrioid carcinoma of the ovary.
Endometrioid ovarian cancer is a specific histopathological entity that accounts for 16% to 25% of epithelial ovarian carcinomas.
Histologically, this variant was recognized by the World Health Orga-

nization (WHO)4 in 1964. Clinicopathological features include a higher proportion of cases with well
differentiated (grade 1) histology and early stage disease. There is also an association with concurrent
endometrial carcinomas and endometriosis.5–10
Some authors have suggested that endometrioid
pathology is associated with better overall survival
than serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary.4,11–16 However, more recently, there has been speculation that
this could be because the majority of these patients
have early stage disease.7,17 To our knowledge, there
have been no published stage-for-stage comparisons
of the 2 histological types to date. Endometrioid and
clear cell variants are postulated to arise from the
same cell type,18 and although platinum-based
chemotherapy (PBC) is now accepted as the best
first-line treatment, Sugiyama et al. found response
rates to PBC in ovarian clear cell tumors of 11.1%
compared with 72.5% for serous adenocarcinoma of
the ovary.1 However, there are few published data
that specifically examine the PBC response in endometrioid tumors.
Our aims were to compare a sequential set of
patients who were treated for pure endometrioid or
serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary at the Edinburgh Cancer Center over a period of 20 years with
regard to 1) presenting characteristics, 2) PBC
response rates, and 3) survival outcomes (overall and
stage-for-stage comparisons). To our knowledge, this
is the largest published comparison of this nature to
date.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Between 1984–2001, 1545 patients with epithelial
ovarian adenocarcinoma were treated at the Edinburgh Cancer Center. After central pathology review
by experienced gynecological pathologists (authors
A.A.N.and A.R.W.), data were prospectively collected
on all patients as part of their routine clinical care.
Information collected included age at diagnosis,
FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and
Obstetrics) disease stage, tumor grade, surgical
debulking status, WHO performance status, concurrent endometrial malignancies, chemotherapy regimen, objective response to chemotherapy, CA125
levels, progression-free and overall survival. Individual informed patient consent was not sought, as
these data were routinely obtained and used as part
of these patients’ clinical care. Ethical approval was
given for ovarian cancer specimen collection with
annotated clinical information.
Follow-up data up until 2004 were analyzed
anonymously for patients with pure endometrioid or

pure serous epithelial ovarian cancers. Patients
excluded from analysis were those with 1) mixed histology epithelial ovarian cancer (24 patients had
mixed serous and endometrioid pathology) and 2) a
previous malignancy other than endometrial or basal
cell skin carcinoma. Of the 1261 patients for whom
ovarian cancer was their first cancer diagnosis
(including those with a concurrent endometrial
malignancy), 270 (21.4%) had pure endometrioid adenocarcinoma, and 659 (52.2%) patients had pure serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary.
With the exception of early stage disease or
where it was technically impossible, surgery included
hysterectomy, bilateral salpingoophorectomy, omentectomy, and cytoreductive surgery for those with
advanced disease. Lymphadenectomy was not routinely performed, which is normal practice in the
United Kingdom.
For patients with postoperatively measurable disease, objective response to chemotherapy was evaluated by computed tomography. WHO and
International Union Against Cancer (UICC) response
criteria were used. A complete response (CR) was
defined as the complete disappearance of all clinically detectable disease confirmed by second evaluation at least 4 weeks later. A partial response (PR)
was defined as a >50% decrease in tumor size for at
least 4 weeks without an increase in the size of any
other known lesion or the appearance of a new
lesion. No change was defined as the absence of any
significant change in measurable lesions confirmed
by a second evaluation at least 4 weeks later. Progressive disease was defined as the appearance of a
new lesion or a >25% increase in tumor size. Those
patients who had a CR or PR were deemed to have
responded to treatment. For those who had a raised
CA125 postoperatively, where possible the CA125
response was analyzed according to Rustin’s criteria.19,20
Progression-free survival was defined as the
interval from the date of primary surgery until the
date of documented recurrence on the basis of clinical examination, ultrasound, or computed tomography. Duration of survival was the date of primary
surgery to death or the last follow-up contact. For
those who did not have definitive surgery, then these
intervals were calculated from the date of diagnosis.
Patients who died of a nonmalignant cause or a new
malignancy and had no active ovarian cancer were
censored in the survival analysis.

Statistical Analysis
Associations between the histological groups, demographic characteristics, and clinical characteristics

were assessed by using the Mann-Whitney U test for
continuous variables, and the chi-square test or the
Fisher exact test was used for categorical factors.
Analyses of survival data were performed by using
the log-rank test and the Cox regression model, and
survival curves were computed by using the KaplanMeier method. A 2-sided P value of .05 was considered statistically significant. The statistical software
used was SPSS 12.0 for Windows, Release 12.0.1
(SPSS, Chicago, Ill).

RESULTS
Presentation Characteristics (see Table 1)
The median age of diagnosis for patients with
endometrioid tumors was slightly but statistically
significantly younger than those with serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary. The majority of tumors
were poorly differentiated in both groups, but the
proportion was less in the endometrioid group.
Those in the endometrioid group were more likely to
present with early stage disease. Overall, significantly
fewer endometrioid patients presented with ascites.
In case this was because endometrioid tumors present with earlier stage disease, stage-for-stage comparisons were performed and showed this was still
the case even for stage II and III disease. More
advanced disease stages were associated with more
poorly differentiated tumors for both endometrioid
and serous adenocarcinoma groups (P < .001 for both,
data not shown). The WHO performance status (PS)
was significantly better in the endometrioid group.
Again, in case this was because endometrioid tumors
present more frequently with early stage disease and
have potentially less comorbidity, performance status
was analyzed on a stage-for-stage basis. The relation
remained for patients with stage II and III disease.
Overall, more patients with endometrioid tumors
were debulked to less than 2 cm residual disease.
When analyzed on a stage-for-stage basis, there were
no statistically significant differences, but there was
still a trend for a greater proportion of stage III endometrioid tumors to be debulked compared to serous
tumors.
Of patients with endometrioid ovarian tumors,
10% (26 of 270) had a concurrent endometrial malignancy compared with only 0.2% (1 of 659) of patients
with serous adenocarcinoma (P < .001). Within the
endometrioid group, those patients who also had a
concurrent endometrial malignancy had significantly
better survival than those who had only an ovarian
tumor (median survival not reached vs 46 months;
P 5 .003; Fig. 1). Because the number of patients was
small, it was not possible to control for stage in this
analysis.

Chemotherapy Received (see Table 2)
Chemotherapy was administered to 81% (754 of 929)
of patients. A significantly smaller proportion of
patients with endometrioid tumors had chemotherapy compared with those in the serous adenocarcinoma group; 75% (202 of 270) versus 84% (552 of
659), P 5 .002, presumably because of earlier stage
disease presentation. Platinum-based chemotherapy
accounted for 84% (636 of 754) of the total chemotherapy given to both groups.
There was no difference between endometrioid
and serous adenocarcinoma with regard to the proportion of patients who received single-agent platinum, platinum 1 taxane, or other combinationplatinum chemotherapy (Table 2; P 5 .077). The
other platinum combinations that patients received
included cisplatin and prednimustine (67 patients);
cisplatin and intraperitoneal alpha-interferon (26
patients); cisplatin and topotecan (25 patients); carboplatin and hexalen (22 patients); cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, hexalen, and prednimustine (17 patients);

Comparison of endometrioid and serous adenocarcinoma groups revealed no statistically significant
differences between overall objective response rates
to PBC or any of the response rates to the 3 PBC
regimens.

CA 125 Response to Platinum-based Chemotherapy
(PBC) (see Table 4)
CA125 response was evaluable in 373 of 637 (59%) of
those who received PBC (251 of 416 received a single
agent, 44 of 60 platinum 1 taxane, and 78 of 160 had
other combination-platinum regimens). Overall, the
CA125 response rate to PBC was 63%. Platinum 1 taxane had a significantly better overall
CA125 response rate than single-agent or other combinations of platinum (77% vs 63% and 54%, respectively; P 5 .037).
Comparison between the endometrioid and serous adenocarcinoma groups yielded no statistically
significant differences between overall PBC CA125
response rates or any of the different PBC regimens.
Progression-free Survival for Patients Who Received
Platinum-based Chemotherapy (PBC) (see Table 5)
Median follow-up was 24.5 months (range, 1 month
to 229 months). Overall median progression-free sur-

vival was significantly longer for those with endometrioid histology (24 months vs 13 months; log-rank
P < .0001). One-year, 3-year, and 5-year progressionfree survivals are shown in Table 5. Due to the
predominance of early stage disease in the endometrioid group, further analyses were performed on a
stage-for-stage basis. Median progression-free survival was significantly longer for the endometrioid
groups with stage II or III disease (stage II, 47
months vs 26 months; P 5 .022) (stage III, 15 months
vs 13 months; P 5 .038). However, there were no differences between histologies for those with stage I or
IV disease. Comparisons within the stage III endometrioid group showed that those who had debulking
surgery to <2 cm residual disease had a significantly
longer progression-free survival than those who did
not (21 months vs 9 months; log-rank P 5 .0001).
The same was also true for the serous adenocarcinoma group (16 months vs 11months; log-rank
P < .0001). Comparison of stage III patients who
had debulking surgery to <2 cm residual disease
revealed that there was no difference in progressionfree survival between the endometrioid and serous

Overall Cause-Specific Survival for Patients Who
Received Platinum-based Chemotherapy (PBC)
(see Table 6)
Overall median survival was substantially better for
patients with endometrioid histology than those with
serous adenocarcinoma (48 months vs 22 months;
log-rank P < .0001; Fig. 2). One-year, 3-year, and 5year survivals are shown in Table 6. Shorter survival
was associated with increasing disease stage for both
groups (log-rank P < .0001). Because of the predominance of early stage disease in the endometrioid
group, survival was further analyzed on a stage-forstage basis. For stages II and III, median survival was
significantly better in the endometrioid group (stage
II, 81 months vs 46 months; log-rank P 5 .029; Fig.
3b) (stage III, 33 months vs 22 months; log-rank
P 5 .002; Fig. 3c). However, there were no significant
differences between the 2 histologies for stage I or IV
disease (Figs. 3a and 3d).
For stage III endometrioid cancer, those who had
debulking surgery to <2 cm residual disease survived
longer than those who did not (50 months vs 16
months; log-rank P 5 .004; Fig. 4a). The same was
true for the serous adenocarcinoma group (34
months vs 18 months; log-rank P < .001; Fig. 4b).
A comparison of post-PBC survival on the basis
of tumor grade showed that patients with moderately
differentiated (grade 2) and poorly differentiated
(grade 3) endometrioid tumors had significantly longer survival than those with serous adenocarcinoma
(moderately differentiated, 51 months vs 27 months;
log-rank P 5 .05) (poorly differentiated, 40 months vs

21 months; log-rank P < .001). There was no difference for well differentiated (grade 1) tumors (median
survival not reached vs 88 months; log-rank P 5 .075).

Independent Predictors of Survival in Patients Who
Received PBC (see Table 7)
The univariate analysis showed histology, debulking
status, performance status, tumor grade, disease
stage, and age were all significant prognostic factors.
After these factors were entered into the multivariate
analysis, histological type (which is surprising and
novel), debulking status, and disease stage were
independent predictors of survival.

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the largest prospectively
collected pure ovarian endometrioid carcinoma data

set. We believe it is the first to present a detailed
comparison with pure serous adenocarcinoma of the
ovary regarding both objective and CA125 response
rates to PBC as well as stage-for-stage survival comparisons.
In summary, there was no difference in the
objective or the CA125 response rate to PBC between
patients with endometrioid and serous adenocarcinoma. Despite this, survival was better for patients
with endometrioid tumors than for patients with serous adenocarcinoma, even with stage III disease or
poorly differentiated tumors. After receiving PBC,
histological type was an independent predictor of
survival favoring endometrioid adenocarcinoma
along with debulking status and FIGO stage.
We did not find any significant differences
between endometrioid and serous adenocarcinoma
groups regarding either objective or CA125 response
rates to PBC. We could locate only 1 other study that
made reference specifically to PBC response rates in
patients who had ovarian endometrioid tumors.7
They found a 72% response rate, although this was
not according to WHO/UICC criteria, so a comparison must be undertaken cautiously. In the current
study, 29% of the endometrioid group and 48% of
the serous adenocarcinoma group had objectively
measurable disease after surgery. These proportions
are relatively small but comparable to those presented by Sugiyama et al.,1 who found clear cell
tumors had only an 11% response rate to PBC.
Sugiyama et al. did not evaluate CA125 response, but
in our sample, a greater proportion were evaluable
by this method, 51% endometrioid and 62% serous
adenocarcinoma.
In common with other studies, our patients with
endometrioid tumors had a much better overall sur-

earlier stage of presentation rather than an effect of
histological type itself.7,17 However, this survival
advantage was still present for stage II and III dis-

eases in our sample. It is noteworthy that this was
despite WHO performance status being better in the
serous adenocarcinoma group for stage II disease.
The pattern was the same for progression-free survival. Grosso et al.6 compared 106 endometrioid
cases with 355 cases of serous adenocarcinoma of

the ovary and found 5-year survival was better for
the endometrioid group (56% vs 41%); however, the
Grosso study did not compare survival on a stagefor-stage basis. Bjorkholm et al.21 compared a number of histological ovarian cancer variants and found
endometrioid tumors had a more favorable survival
than serous adenocarcinoma, but they compared
only within stages IA and IB. Zwart et al.22 compared
21 patients matched for age, stage, grade, and level
of cytoreduction and found no significant 5-year survival differences between their endometrioid and serous adenocarcinoma histology groups. With the
exception of Grosso et al., none of these reports
included patients who received PBC.
Other authors have stated that the majority of
endometrioid tumors are well differentiated or moderately differentiated.7 In our series, we found that
the majority (56%) of endometrioid tumors were, in
fact, poorly differentiated. However, this was still a
smaller proportion than the serous adenocarcinoma
group (64%). Post-PBC survival comparisons on the
basis of tumor grade showed that patients with moderately or poorly differentiated endometrioid tumors
still had a survival advantage when compared with
serous adenocarcinoma patients. Malkasian et al.15
performed multivariate analysis on sample of 1938
women with epithelial ovarian cancers, among which
958 were serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary and
75 were endometrioid. They grouped histological
types on the basis of stage and grade combinations.
Generally, there was no difference in survival
between histological subtypes, with the exception
that patients with endometrioid tumors did better
than patients with serous adenocarcinoma in stage

IA, grade 2; stage IB/C, grade 2; and stage III, grade
3 groupings. However, Malkasian et al. do advise cautious interpretation of these results, as their number
of patients was very small, and there were multiple
statistical comparisons.
The prevalence of endometrioid tumors in our
sample was comparable to other published studies.
In common with other reports,7 our finding was that
pure endometrioid tumors were the second most
common epithelial ovarian cancer (21.4%), surpassed
only by pure serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary
(52.2%). Our findings confirmed that, in comparison
to the serous adenocarcinoma group, the endometrioid group had a greater proportion of stages I and
II disease5,7,17,23 and better performance status overall. A smaller proportion of the endometrioid group
than the serous adenocarcinoma group had ascites
associated with stages II and III disease, although, to
our knowledge, there are no other published data for
comparison.
In our data set, 10% of endometrioid cases were
associated with a concurrent uterine endometrial
malignancy. This was comparable to other studies6,9
(11% to 23%), and, in common with other published
data, we found this group had a survival advantage
over those who had an ovarian malignancy only.8,10
However, other authors report conflicting findings.5–7,9
Consistent with previously published studies, for
both groups, patients who had debulking surgery to
<2 cm residual disease before PBC survived longer
and had a longer time to disease progression than
those patients who did not have debulking surgery.
We found histological type, debulking status, and
stage were independent predictors of survival in
patients who received platinum-based chemotherapy.
To our knowledge, this is the first study that is large
enough to have allowed investigation of the effect of
histological type in this chemotherapy group. Kline
et al.7 found significant factors associated with survival were stage, grade, and extent of debulking;
however, these were not put into a multivariate statistical model. They proposed that histological type
could be a prognostic factor. Grosso et al.6 used univariate analysis and found that FIGO stage, grade, residual disease, lymph-node status, and platinum
chemotherapy were all prognostic factors; however,
only stage was significant in their multivariate
model. Voest24 performed a meta-analysis of 3443
patients with epithelial ovarian cancer and found
that significant independent prognostic factors were
cisplatin chemotherapy, debulking to <2 cm, FIGO
stage, and performance status.
Endometrioid carcinomas of the ovary have distinct molecular features that differentiate them from

Endometrioid Ovarian Cancer Characteristics/Storey et al.

other types of ovarian cancer. PTEN is a tumor-suppressor gene that negatively regulates the PI3K pathway, which is involved in cell growth and survival.
Endometriod ovarian tumors have been found to
have frequent loss of heterozygosity (45% to 75%) or
mutations25–27 ( 20%) of PTEN suggesting frequent
deletion or mutational inactivation of this tumorsuppressor gene. Activating mutations of PIK3CA,
which codes for part of PI3K, have also been found
more commonly in endometrioid ovarian tumors
than in histological serous subtypes (20% vs 2.3%,
respectively).28 Catenin B alterations have been
described in endometrioid ovarian cancers.29 p53 is a
transcription factor, which regulates the cell cycle via
transactivation of several genes involved in arresting
the cell cycle or in promoting apoptosis. The efficacy
of cisplatin is thought to be dependent on the normal functioning of p53. Endometrioid tumors generally have normal p53 expression, and serous tumors
are more commonly associated with mutant p53 and
poorer survival.30,31 In our sample, the response rates
to platinum for endometrioid and serous adenocarcinoma histologies were similar, suggesting that p53
gene status may not be an important determinant of
platinum response. It was beyond the scope of this
study to analyze individual tumors by these and
other molecular features; however, we plan to undertake this analysis once a tissue microarray linked to
these data has been generated.
In conclusion, endometrioid histology is associated with a better survival compared with serous
adenocarcinoma, regardless of response to platinumbased chemotherapy or disease stage, and is an independent predictor of survival. Recent considerations
for trial design in ovarian cancer globally have begun
to focus on histology. Several trials based on treatment by histological type are now being designed or
have commenced (Japanese Gynecologic Oncology
Group/Intergroup Clear Cell Carcinoma study and
National Cancer Research Institute’s Mucinous
Epithelial Ovarian Cancer Trial [MEOC] and Scottish
Gynecological Cancer Trials Group’s Carcinosarcoma
studies), although these approaches remain controversial. On the basis of our findings from this study,
we conclude that the chemotherapeutic response of
endometrioid ovarian cancer does not differ sufficiently to warrant this approach, and we would not
recommend that these patients are treated differently
with chemotherapy from serous adenocarcinoma
patients. However, with clarity emerging, molecular
lesions for endometrioid ovarian cancer demonstrate
significant heterogeneity within endometrioid tumors32
and significant differences compared with serous
adenocarcinoma of the ovary. There may neverthe-

2219

less be a future role for separating these tumors for
different approaches when integrating molecularly
targeted therapy with chemotherapy.
