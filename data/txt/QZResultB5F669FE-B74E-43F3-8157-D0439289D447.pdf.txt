ABSTRACT
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a frequent cause of cancer-related death;
therefore, more effective anticancer therapies for the treatment of HCC are needed.
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors serve as promising anticancer drugs because
they can induce cell growth arrest and apoptosis. We previously reported that
3-[1-(4-methoxybenzenesulfonyl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-indol-5-yl]-N-hydroxyacrylamide
(MPT0G009)—a novel 1-arylsulfonyl-5-(N-hydroxyacrylamide)indolines compound—
demonstrated potent pan-HDAC inhibition and anti-inflammatory effects. In this
study, we evaluated the anti-HCC activity of MPT0G009 in vitro and in vivo. Growth
inhibition, apoptosis, and inhibited HDAC activity induced by MPT0G009 were more
potent than a marketed HDAC inhibitor SAHA (Vorinostat). Furthermore, MPT0G009induced apoptosis of Hep3B cells was characterized by an increase in apoptotic
(sub-G1) population, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, activation of caspase
cascade, increased levels of pro-apoptotic protein (Bim), and decreased levels of antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and FLICE-inhibitory protein); the downregulation
FLIP by MPT0G009 is mediated through proteasome-mediated degradation and
transcriptional suppression. In addition, combinations of tumor necrosis factor-related
apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) with lower concentrations (0.1 μM) of MPT0G009
were synergistic in cell growth inhibition and apoptosis in HCC cells. In the in vivo
model, MPT0G009 markedly reduced Hep3B xenograft tumor volume, inhibited HDAC
activities, and induced apoptosis in the Hep3B xenografts. Our results demonstrate
that MPT0G009 is a potential new candidate drug for HCC therapy.

outcome remains poor and the prognosis is generally
unsatisfactory [2]. In particular, advanced HCC cells
have been known to respond poorly to the induction of
apoptosis by chemotherapeutic agents due to escaping
of the cellular apoptotic pathway [3]. Thus, strategies
to lower the thresholds for triggering apoptosis in
HCC may result in new and more effective therapeutic
regimens.
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL), a type II transmembrane
protein, belongs to the TNF family. TRAIL can
bind to death receptor (DR) 4 and 5 to trigger the
extrinsic pathway of apoptosis [4]. TRAIL is a
promising anticancer agent because of its ability to
induce apoptosis in various tumor cell types while
showing only negligible effects on normal cells [5].
However, several tumor types including HCC exert a
profound resistance to TRAIL treatment, majorly due
to the constitutive expression of intracellular TRAIL
resistance-mediating factors, such as FADD-like
interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (FLICE)-inhibitory
protein (FLIP), in cancer cells [6, 7]. FLIP resembles the
structure of caspases 8 but lacks the functional caspase
domain; therefore, FLIP interferes with TNF-α, FasL,
and TRAIL-induced apoptotic pathways by binding to
the Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and caspase
8, which in turn, inhibits the death-inducing signal
complex (DISC) formation and subsequent activation
of the caspase cascade [8, 9]. Furthermore, FLIP
induces cellular functions including increased cell
proliferation and tumorigenesis [10]. Therefore, several
studies have focused on attenuating the inhibition
of cellular apoptosis through FLIP downregulation,
which increases the sensitivity to TRAIL [11, 12],
suggesting its promising therapeutic potential in HCC
treatment.
Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are the key
enzymes of epigenetic regulation by post-translational
modifications of core histone or non-histone proteins;
HDACs are considered to be new and promising
anticancer targets, and four HDAC inhibitors have been
approved for clinical use. We previously synthesized
1-arylsulfonyl-5-(N-hydroxyacrylamide)indoline
derived HDAC inhibitors. Among these compounds,
3-[1-(4-methoxybenzenesulfonyl)-2,3-dihydro-1Hindol-5-yl]-N-hydroxyacrylamide
(MPT0G009)
exhibited potent anti-arthritic effects and superior
pharmacokinetic parameters, indicating its potential as
a therapeutic agent [13, 14]. However, the molecular
action of MPT0G009 in the inhibition of cancer
growth has not been clearly elucidated. In this study,
we examined the antitumor activities of MPT0G009 in
human HCC cells using in vitro and in vivo models and
determined whether combining MPT0G009 with TRAIL
could enhance sensitivity to TRAIL in HCC cells.

MPT0G009 inhibited cell proliferation and
viability in human HCC cells
In a previous study, we revealed the structure
of MPT0G009 and it was shown to exhibit a potent
inhibitory effect on pan-HDAC enzymatic activities
[14]. In this study, we first used the sulforhodamine
B (SRB) assay to examine whether MPT0G009 could
inhibit HCC growth. As shown in Figure 1A, in the
three HCC cell lines, Hep3B, HepG2, and Huh7,
MPT0G009 treatment inhibited tumor proliferation in
a dose-dependent manner; the GI50 values (0.11 ± 0.02,
0.22 ± 0.03, and 0.55 ± 0.05 μM, respectively) were
more lower than those for SAHA (1.54 ± 0.19, 1.70
± 0.07, and 1.92 ± 0.10 μM, respectively; Figure 1B),
indicating higher potency of MPT0G009. Furthermore,
the cytotoxic effect of MPT0G009 was determined
by MTT assay: MPT0G009 caused 50% cell death at
a concentration of 0.75 ± 0.02 μM in Hep3B (Figure
1C) or 7.61 ± 1.06 μM in normal human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVECs; Figure 1E). In contrast,
the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of
SAHA was 13.7 ± 0.94 μM (Figure 1D) or 50.29
± 7.19 μM (Figure 1F), respectively, in both cells.
These results indicated that MPT0G009 has potential
for inhibition of cell proliferation and viability in
HCC  cells and that it specifically targets malignant
tumor cells.

MPT0G009 inhibited HDAC activity in human
Hep3B cells
We next determined the HDAC inhibitory effect
of MPT0G009 in Hep3B cells. In Figure 2A, the HDAC
inhibition IC50 of MPT0G009 was 1.66 ± 0.06 μM in
Hep3B cells, i.e., it was at least 40-fold more potent than
SAHA (IC50 = 72.14 ± 4.52 μM; Figure 2B). Because
histone H3 and α-tubulin are downstream targets of
HDAC, we examined the effects of MPT0G009 on the
acetylation of histone H3 and α-tubulin in HCC cells by
western blotting. As shown in Figure 2C, MPT0G009
induced a significant hyperacetylation of histone H3
and α-tubulin in a concentration-dependent manner; this
effect was not mediated through modulation of HDACs
expression because there were no marked changes in
HDAC1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 levels in response to MPT0G009
treatment. Of note, the potency of MPT0G009 on the
induction of acetylated-H3 was significantly higher
than SAHA, whereas as the induction of α-tubulin
acetylation was less obvious than acetylated-H3. These
data are consistent with our previous study showing that
MPT0G009 is more potent than SAHA in inhibiting
class-I HDACs than HDAC6 [14].

MPT0G009 significantly induced Hep3B cell
apoptosis

and percentage of cells in the sub-G1 phase of the cell
cycle in both dose- and time-dependent manner. Of note,
MPT0G009 treatment induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M

reference compound SAHA also produced a dose- and

MPT0G009 markedly inhibits tumor growth. Hence,
we investigated the effect of MPT0G009 on cell cycle
progression. As shown in Figure 3A and Supplemental

time-dependent increase in the percentage of cells in the
sub-G1 phase, but with lesser potency compared with
MPT0G009. Because mitochondrial membrane potential
loss is associated with apoptosis, we determined whether
MPT0G009 treatment could change mitochondrial
membrane potential. Hep3B cells were exposed to 3 μM
MPT0G009 for the indicated times (6, 12, 18, or 24 h)
and treated with fluorescence dye rhodamine 123 for 1 h;
then, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown
as Figure 3B, MPT0G009 treatment triggered significant
loss of mitochondrial membrane potential starting at 12 h,
which was maintained at least until after 24 h, compared
with those of an untreated control; SAHA caused a
similar effect, but with lesser potency than MPT0G009.

In addition, MPT0G009 treatment not only increased the
expression of caspase 3, 7, 8, and 9 and poly (ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP) cleavage forms in a concentrationdependent (Figure 4A) and time-dependent (Figure 4B)
manner but also increased levels of pro-apoptotic protein
Bim, decreased levels of Bid proform, and downregulated
expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and
FLIP (Figure 4C). Furthermore, no changes in death
ligands (TRAIL and FasL) and death receptors (DR4,
DR5, and Fas) were observed in response to MPT0G009
treatment (Figure  4D) and higher TRAIL and TNF-α
expressions were detected in Hep3B cells (Supplemental
figure 3). Thus, MPT0G009 induced apoptosis through a
caspase-dependent pathway.

MPT0G009 synergistically enhanced TRAILinduced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis in
human HCC cells

growth inhibition (Figure 5A and 5B); lower concentration
(0.1 μM) of MPT0G009 alone caused only mild inhibition
in both cells (Figure 5A and 5B). However, a significant
inhibition on cell growth was observed after treatment
with a combination of MPT0G009 and TRAIL compared
with a single-agent group, and this combination showed a
synergistic anti-proliferation effect because the combination
index was evaluated by applying the Chou–Talalay method
and the values were < 1.0 (Figure 5A and 5B) [16].
Furthermore, combined treatment with MPT0G009 (0.05 or
0.1 μM) and TRAIL (5, 10, and 25 ng/mL) in Hep3B cells
caused marked increase in expression of cleavage form of
PARP/caspase 3 and downregulation of FLIP compared
with single treatment (Figure 5C), and this combination

FLIP can interrupt TRAIL, TNF-α, or FasL-induced
apoptosis by binding to FADD and/or caspase 8, which in
turn, prevents DISC formation and subsequent activation
of the caspase cascade [9]. Our result showed MPT0G009
treatment decreased FLIP expression (Figure 4C), thus
suggesting it could sensitize TRAIL-induced apoptosis. We
further evaluated the apoptotic effect with a combination
of MPT0G009 and TRAIL. TRAIL treatment (5, 10,
25, and 50 ng/mL) in Hep3B and Huh7 cells, which are
TRAIL-resistant [15], for 48 h did not cause significant cell

also exerts synergistic effect in apoptosis (Figure 5D,
Supplemental figure 4–6). Similar synergistic cell growth
inhibition was observed with an MPT0G009 and TNF-α
combination in Hep3B cells (Figure 5E). Thus, MPT0G009
synergistically enhanced TRAIL-induced cell growth
inhibition and apoptosis.

in HCC cells occurred through proteasome-mediated
degradation. As shown as Figure 6A, MPT0G009 treatment
decreased FLIP expression in Hep3B cells; however,
proteasome inhibitor MG132 treatment significantly
reversed MPT0G009-mediated FLIP downregulation;
and no changes in cell death and NF-κB activation were
observed in response to MG132 treatment (Supplemental
figure 7, 8). The phenomenon was further confirmed
by the examination of protein stability of FLIP in the
presence of protein-synthesis inhibitor-cycloheximide.
As shown as Figure 6B and 6C, FLIP proteins gradually
down-regulation within 4 h after cycloheximide treatment.
However, MPT0G009 treatment group significantly downregulated the expression of FLIP while comparing with

MPT0G009-induced FLIP downregulation is

DISCUSSION

vehicle group. These results indicated that MPT0G009
reduced the protein stability of FLIPL/S in Hep3B cells.
Furthermore, MPT0G009 treatment also markedly
decreased FLIP mRNA expression (Figure 6D). These
results indicated a proteasome-degradation pathway
and transcriptional suppression were involved in FLIP
downregulation by MPT0G009. In addition, we examined
whether MPT0G009 mediated apoptosis by inhibiting
HDAC activity, we transiently transfected HDAC1-,
4-, and HDAC6-encoding plasmids to Hep3B cells,
and the result indicated the expression of the expected
isoforms (Figure 7A). Empty vector-transfected or
HDAC1-, HDAC4-, and HDAC6-coexpressing Hep3B
cells were incubated for 24 h with or without 3 μM
MPT0G009; then, cell lysates were subjected to western
blotting. The data showed that overexpression of HDACs
significantly reduced the expression of caspase 3, PARP
cleavage and downregulation of FLIP while comparing
with the MPT0G009 treatment group (Figure 7B).
Moreover, ectopically expression of HDACs also showed
a reversal effects on MPT0G009-induced cytotoxicity
(Figure 7C). These results showed that the MPT0G009induced apoptosis was primarily due to a decrease in
HDAC activity.

Hepatocellular carcinoma is a complex and
heterogeneous tumor. A characteristic property of
HCC is its ability to escape apoptosis, which primarily
results from a lack of response to apoptosis [3, 18]
that causes HCC cells to be resistant to cell death and
refractory to classical chemotherapy [19]. Therefore,
new strategies to address the resistance of HCC cells
to apoptosis are required. HDACs display multifaceted
functions by coordinating the interaction of signal
pathways with chromatin structure remodeling and the
activation of non-histone proteins, which play critical
roles in cellular processes including apoptosis [20].
Thus, HDAC inhibitors are considered promising agents
for cancer treatment, and four HDAC inhibitors have
been approved for clinical use in T-cell lymphoma and
multiple myeloma therapies. In a previous study, we
have evaluated the preclinical anti-arthritic effects of
an orally available HDAC inhibitor, MPT0G009, both
in in vitro and in vivo models. MPT0G009 was found
to inhibit synoviocyte proliferation, reduce osteoclast
differentiation, and ameliorate arthritis progression.
In addition, MPT0G009 exhibited longer half-life and
higher oral bioavailability in rats compared with SAHA
[14]. In this study, our data showed that MPT0G009
treatment in three HCC cells markedly inhibited HCC
cell growth and viability; both effects were more
potent than SAHA. In addition, HDAC inhibitorinduced p21 (Waf1/Cip1) expression is thought to be
p53 independent. Supporting data from SAHA, a panHDAC inhibitor, was reported to have equal effective in
p53-wild type and null cells, and it does not require p53
to exert its anticancer action [21]. In the current study,
we observed that MPT0G009 induces the expression
of p21 and activation of caspase 9 in Hep3B (p53-null)
and HepG2 cells (p53-WT; Supplemental figure 9). As
shown, MPT0G009 treatment induced significant p21
expression in both cells. Moreover, MPT0G009 induced
significant mitochondria membrane loss (Figure 3B) and
decreased the levels of anti-apoptotic proteins (Figure
4C). These data suggests that MPT0G009 can trigger
intrinsic apoptotic pathway through perturbing normal
function of mitochondria.
The binding of death ligands result in the
formation of death receptor signaling platforms and
subsequent apoptosis initiation. Among death ligands,
TRAIL has been proved to be a safe and effective
biological agent for cancer therapy because TRAILbased therapy offers a profound apoptotic effect but
without causing obvious adverse effects on normal cells
[5, 22]. This effect was better than that of other members
of the TNF receptor ligand family, such as TNF-α and
FasL, which could increase the risk of lethal systemic
inflammation and hepatotoxicity [23, 24]. However,
resistance to TRAIL-mediated therapy has been

MPT0G009 inhibited growth of human HCC
cells in vivo
Further, we evaluated the in vivo inhibitory tumor
growth effect of MPT0G009 using a xenograft model.
Once a tumor size of 50 mm3 was achieved, mice were
orally treated with the vehicle (control) or vehicle with
MPT0G009 (25 and 100 mg/kg) once daily. As shown
in Figure 8A, administration of MPT0G009 (100 mg/
kg) significantly reduced tumor volume. In addition,
no significant differences in weight loss were observed
during MPT0G009 treatment periods (Figure 8B).
Moreover, tumor homogenates prepared for western
blotting showed there were significantly increased
levels of acetyl-α-tubulin, acetyl-histone H3, cleavage
form of caspase 9, and PARP as well as downregulation
of FLIP expression in the MPT0G009 treatment group
(Figure 8C). Furthermore, hyperacetylation of histone
H3 was observed in the slides of the MPT0G009
treatment group (Figure 8D). These results show that
MPT0G009  treatment significantly inhibited tumor
growth in vivo.
Taken together, our results showed that
MPT0G009 treatment significantly inhibited HCC cell
growth, and induced apoptosis by activating extrinsic
and intrinsic apoptotic pathways (Figure 9). Moreover,
MPT0G009 treatment downregulated FLIP expression,
and when combined with TRAIL, it exhibited
synergistic cell growth inhibition and apoptosis.
Thus, MPT0G009 has great potential as a new cancer
therapeutic agent.

observed in HCC cells and indicates TRAIL treatment
alone in these cells could not induce apoptosis; this
defect limits its further use in clinical treatment [15].
Detailed mechanisms of resistance to TRAIL in HCC
cells have not been elucidated. Recent studies have
shown that FLIP is highly expressed in HCC tissues,
and it can inhibit apoptotic signals by preventing the
recruitment of caspase 8 at the DISC and suppress the
subsequent activation of the caspase cascade [6, 8, 9,
25]. Previous results and our data (Supplemental figure
10) have shown that FLIP was constitutively expressed
in Hep3B, HepG2, and Huh7 cells, which were reported
to be TRAIL-resistant HCC cells [11, 26]. MPT0G009
treatment markedly downregulated FLIP levels in

Hep3B cells, and this suppression was dependent on
proteasome-mediated degradation and transcriptional
inhibition. Previous studies have demonstrated that
HDAC inhibitor mediated protein degradation by
proteasome may cause by increasing hyper-acetylation
of Hsp90, a chaperon protein, and further appeared to
cause disruption of Hsp90-mediated folding of proteins,
and lead to its subsequent degradation by proteasome
[27, 28]. Furthermore, FLIP downregulation and increase
Bim levels were observed after MPT0G009 treatment for
6 h, which was ahead of the appearance of the cleavage
forms of caspases, and there was a decrease in the Bid
proform level and in the expression of anti-apoptotic
proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Therefore, MPT0G009 must

have modulated FLIP and Bim expression and then
mediated subsequent caspase activation and decrease
in anti-apoptotic proteins. In addition, MPT0G009mediated FLIP downregulation implies that it could
have potential for use with TRAIL to enhance TRAIL
sensitivity in TRAIL-resistant HCC cells. The result
showed that treatment with only TRAIL (5–50 ng/mL)
caused mild cell growth inhibition and small quantity
of cleavage forms of PARP and caspase 3 expressions.
However, a combination of low-concentration (0.1 μM)
MPT0G009 with TRAIL exhibited synergistic inhibition
of cell growth and increase in the cleavage forms of
PARP and caspase 3 levels. Moreover, this increase of
caspase cascades was accompanied by marked FLIP
downregulation in response to combination treatment
with MPT0G009 and TRAIL. Furthermore, previous

studies proposed a correlation between upregulated
TRAIL death receptor DR5 expression level and
restored TRAIL sensitivity by several chemotherapeutic
agents in HCC cells [15] or in leukemic cell lines
[29]. In our study, MPT0G009 treatment in HCC cells
revealed no change of DR4, DR5, TRAIL, FasL, and
Fas levels. These results suggest that MPT0G009
synergistically enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis
by downregulation of FLIP expression, but not by
alteration of the expression of death receptors or ligands.
However, it still exist the possibility that MPT0G009
treatment enhance TRAIL- or TNF-α-induced cell
death through other pathways (e.g. MPT0G009 induced
significant mitochondria membrane loss and decreased
the expressions of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-xL).
In addition, the results from the in vivo xenograft model

also revealed that MPT0G009 treatment significantly
inhibited growth of HCC cells without any obvious
weight loss. Furthermore, marked downregulation of
FLIP levels and increased cleavage forms of caspase 9/
PARP were observed in tumor homogenates.
Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels
from the existing vasculature and is required for the
progression of tumor growth and metastasis. It has been
reported that the growth of HCCs depend on their ability to
recruit blood vessels, and VEGF is critical in this process.
Sorafenib, the anti-angiogenic therapy, was the first
systemic therapy approved for patients with advanced-stage
HCC [30]. Recently, HDAC inhibitors are considered as a
new type of anti-cancer therapeutics, which show promising
results in pre-clinical studies and early phase clinical trials.
MPT0G013, a novel HDAC inhibitor, was reported by our
colleague to inhibit tumor angiogenesis through
up-regulation of TIMP3 expression [31]. The GI50 values

of MPT0G013 on Hep3B cells and HUVECs are 0.36 μM
and 0.14 μM, respectively [31, 32]. In the present study,
we observed that MPT0G009 exhibits greater potency on
cancer cells than HUVECs with the IC50 values of 0.75 μM
and 7.61 μM, respectively. Although the IC50 of MPT0G009
on HUVECs was lower than that of SAHA (Figure 1E and
1F), but the concentration used to cause cancer cells death
was much lower than that on HUVECs. The data suggested
that MPT0G009 is a novel anticancer agent with good
safety on normal cells (Supplemental figure 11).
Taken together, the results of our study indicate
that MPT0G009, a novel HDAC inhibitor, significantly
induced HCC cell apoptosis and inhibited tumor growth.
Furthermore, we characterized the ability of a combination
of MPT0G009 with TRAIL to synergistically overcome
the resistance of HCC cells toward TRAIL. These results
are indicative of the possible therapeutic potential of
MPT0G009 in cancer treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

treated with vehicle or test compound for 48 h. After various
treatments, 0.5 mg/mL of MTT was added and the plates
were incubated at 37°C for an additional 2 h, then the cells
were pelleted and lysed in 100 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide, the
absorbance at 550 nm was measured and the values of 50%
inhibition concentration (IC50) for each compound were
determined. The combination index value was determined
from the fraction-affected value of each combination
according to the Chou–Talalay method by using CompuSyn
software (ComboSyn, Inc.), and a combination index value
below 1 represents synergism [15].

Materials
MPT0G009 and SAHA were synthesized by Dr.
Jing-Ping Liou to greater than 98% purity [12]. The nonconjugated primary antibodies used were against acetylα-tubulin, HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC4, caspase
8, caspase 9, Bid, FasL, acetyl-histone H3, phospho-NFκB p65 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA),
HDAC6, PARP, BimEL, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, FLIPS/L, α-tubulin
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology Corp., Santa Cruz, CA, USA),
caspase 3 and NF-κB p65 (Imgenex, San Diego, CA, USA),
caspase 7 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), TRAIL
(Acris Antibodies, San Diego, CA, USA), DR4 (BioVision
Inc., Milpitas, CA, USA), DR5 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA,
USA), Fas (Epitomics Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA), Flag
tag (Proteintech Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The labeled
secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase (HRP)conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies
(Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc., West Grove, PA, USA). The
HDAC1-FLAG (plasmid 13820), HDAC4-FLAG (plasmid
13821) and HDAC6-FLAG (plasmid 13823) plasmids
were obtained from Addgene Inc. (Cambridge, MA, USA).
Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent was from Life
Technologies Co., Ltd. (Grand Island, NY, USA). Unless
otherwise stated, all other chemicals were from SigmaAldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).

Total HDAC enzymatic activity assay
Cells were treated with either vehicle or test
compounds for 24 h. Total cell lysates were collected
and the total HDAC enzyme activity was analyzed using
HDAC activity fluorometric assay kit (Cat No. K330–100;
BioVision, Milpitax, CA, USA). A fluorescence plate
reader with excitation at 355 nm and emission at 460 nm
was used to quantify HDAC activity. IC50 was determined
at the drug concentration that results in 50% reduction
of total HDAC activity when compared with the control
group.

Western blotting
Cells (1 × 106) were incubated for 10 min at 4°C in
lysis buffer (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/
mL of leupeptin, 5 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium
orthovanadate, 10 μg/mL of aprotinin, 150 mM sodium
chloride, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100
and 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate in 20 mM Tris-HCl
buffer (pH 7.4)) were scraped off, incubated on ice for
an additional 10 min, and centrifuged at 17,000 g for
30 min at 4°C. Total protein was determined and equal
amounts of protein were separated by electrophoresed
on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels (SDSPAGE) and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane,
which was then blocked by incubation for 30 min at room
temperature with 5% fat-free milk in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS). Immunoblotting was performed by overnight
incubation at 4°C with primary antibodies in PBS,
followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with
HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Bound antibodies
were measured using ECL reagent (Advansta Corp.,
Menlo Park, CA, USA) and exposure to photographic
film.

Cell culture
Hep3B, HepG2, Huh7, HA59T and HUVECs
were purchased from Bioresource Collection and
Research Center (Hsinchu, Taiwan). The cells were
cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium
(RPMI)1640 (Hep3B), Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) (HepG2, Huh7 and HA59T) or M199
(HUVEC) respectively supplemented with 10% (Hep3B,
HepG2, Huh7 and HA59T) or 20% (HUVEC) FBS (v/v)
and penicillin (100 U/mL)/streptomycin (100 μg/mL)/
amphotericin B (0.25 μg/mL). All cells were maintained
at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air.

Cell proliferation assay
Cells were incubated for 48 h with the indicated
concentrations of MPT0G009 or SAHA, then were fixed
with 10% trichloroacetic acid, stained for 30 min with
SRB (0.4% in 1% acetic acid), and washed repeatedly
with 1% acetic acid, then protein-bound dye was dissolved
in 10 mM Tris base solution and the optical density at 510
nm measured.

Flow cytometry
The mitochondrial membrane potential was monitored
by rhodamine 123. Cells were treated with test compounds
for the indicated time periods; thirty minutes before the
termination of incubation, the rhodamine 123 solution (final
concentration of 5 mM) was added to the cells and incubated
for the last 30 min at 37°C. The media were removed and

cells were washed once with PBS. After detachment by
trypsinization, cells were resuspended in PBS and subjected
to FACScan analysis. To detect cell cycle progression,
cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed with PBS,
then pellets were resuspended and fixed in ethanol (70%,
v/v) at − 20°C overnight, and washed once with PBS. After
centrifugation, the cells were incubated for 15 minutes at
room temperature in 0.1 mL of phosphate-citric acid buffer
(0.2 M Na2HPO4 and 0.1 M citric acid buffer, pH 7.8).
Cells were stained with propidium iodide staining buffer
containing Triton X-100 (0.1%, v/v), RNase A (100 μg/mL),
and propidium iodide (80 μg/mL) for 30 minutes in the dark.
Cell-cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry with
CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson).

of amplification, the relative mRNA expression level was
determined by calculating the ΔΔCt values and the fold
change was expressed as 2− ΔΔCt. The value of each control
sample was set at 1 and was used to calculate the fold change
in target genes.

Xenograft studies
Hep3B cells were implanted subcutaneously
into eight week old male nude mice. When the tumors
reached the average volume of 50 mm3, the mice were
randomly divided into three groups (n = 8) and then
were orally treated with the vehicle (1% carboxymethyl
cellulose/0.5% Tween 80, 0.2 mL/mouse) or MPT0G009
(25, 100 mg/kg) once daily. The length (L) and width
(W) of the tumor were measured by caliper every 3 to 4
days, and the tumor volume was calculated as L × W2/2.
After twenty-six days, the animals were sacrificed and the
xenografts tumor homogenates were analyzed by western
blotting, or were embedded in paraffin wax then the slides
were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or anti-acetylhistone H3 antibody.

Transfection
The cells were transfected with lipofectamine 2000
(Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.

RNA isolation, RT-PCR and real-time PCR

Ethics

Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen). Single-strand cDNA for a polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) template was synthesized from
5 μg of total RNA using random primers and Moloney
murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega).
The following oligonucleotide primers were used for
amplification: for human cFLIP (GenBank Accession No.
U97074), 5′-TTGAAGATGGACAGAAAAGCTGTGGA
GACC-3′
(forward)
and
5′-CACACAAAGCTGTCGTAGTCTCGGTGCTC-3′
(reverse); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) (GenBank Accession No. NM_002046),
5′-TGATGACATCAAGAAGGTGGTGAAG-3′ (forward)
and 5′-TCCTTGGAGGCCATGTGGGCCAT-3′ (reverse).
Equal amounts (1 μg) of each reverse-transcription
product were PCR-amplified using Taq polymerase and
35 cycles of 1 min at 95°C, 1 min at 58°C, and 1 min at
72°C. The amplified cDNA was run on 1% agarose gels
and visualized under UV light following staining with
SYBR Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen).
Quantitative PCR was performed with mastermix
(TaqMan One Step RT-PCR; ABI) in a total reaction volume
of 20 μl per reaction, containing 10 μL of SYBR green PCR
master mix (Applied Biosystems), 5 pmol of each forward
and reverse primer and 2 μL of cDNA. The oligonucleotide
primers used for the amplification were as follows: for human
cFLIP,
5′-GTGTATGGTGTGGATCAGACTCACT-3′
(forward) and 5′-CATGAATCTCCCATGAACATCCT-3′
(reverse); GAPDH, 5′-ATTCCACCCATGGCAAATTC-3′
(forward) and 5′-TGGGATTTCCATTGATGACAAG-3′
(reverse). GAPDH was used as endogenous control to
normalize differences in total RNA levels in each sample. A
threshold cycle (Ct) was observed in the exponential phase
