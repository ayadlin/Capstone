ABSTRACT
The principal secretory product of the thyroid gland, L-thyroxine (T4), is
anti-apoptotic at physiological concentrations in a number of cancer cell lines. Among
the mechanisms of anti-apoptosis activated by the hormone are interference with the
Ser-15 phosphorylation (activation) of p53 and with TNFα/Fas-induced apoptosis. The
hormone also decreases cellular abundance and activation of proteolytic caspases and
of BAX and causes increased expression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP). The
anti-apoptotic effects of thyroid hormone largely are initiated at a cell surface thyroid
hormone receptor on the extracellular domain of integrin αvβ3 that is amply expressed
and activated in cancer cells. Tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac) is a T4 derivative that,
in a model of resveratrol-induced p53-dependent apoptosis in glioma cells, blocks the
anti-apoptotic action of thyroid hormone, permitting specific serine phosphorylation
of p53 and apoptosis to proceed. In a nanoparticulate formulation limiting its action
to αvβ3, tetrac modulates integrin-dependent effects on gene expression in human
cancer cell lines that include increased expression of a panel of pro-apoptotic genes
and decreased transcription of defensive anti-apoptotic XIAP and MCL1 genes. By a
variety of mechanisms, thyroid hormone (T4) is an endogenous anti-apoptotic factor
that may oppose chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in αvβ3-expressing cancer cells.
It is possible to decrease this anti-apoptotic activity pharmacologically by reducing
circulating levels of T4 or by blocking effects of T4 that are initiated at αvβ3.

thyroid hormone [4, 5], to participate in nongenomic events
that may not require nuclear uptake of TR.
In dividing endothelial cells, tumor cells, osteoclasts
and certain other cells, the plasma membrane bears in
large quantities a structural protein, integrin αvβ3, whose
extracellular domain contains a specific receptor for thyroid
hormone [6, 7]. This receptor site is not structurally related
to the binding site for iodothyronines on TRs. The functions
of this receptor on the integrin are distinct from those of
the nuclear receptors. However, the hormone-binding
site on αvβ3 may support nuclear uptake (trafficking) of
cytoplasmic TR, phosphorylation of TRs and the formation
of intranuclear complexes of coactivator proteins that
are relevant to genomic hormonal actions involving

INTRODUCTION
Thyroid hormone as L-thyroxine (T4) is the major
secretory product of the normal thyroid gland. It is
converted to 3,5,3′-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) by deiodination
to effect genomic hormonal actions that require nuclear
receptors for thyroid hormone (TRs) [1]. These actions
in normal cells involve transcription of a large number
of genes whose transcriptional products regulate a large
number of metabolic processes essential to normal cell
function. Nuclear receptors may reside in nonnuclear
compartments, such as cytoplasm, and undergo nuclear
importation that may be thyroid hormone-directed [2, 3].
Or, they may interact as a plasma membrane receptor with

TR-regulated genes [8]. At the integrin αvβ3 receptor for
thyroid hormone, T4 and T3 initiate complex pro-angiogenic
activities that may include transcription of vascular growth
factor genes [9–12], nontranscriptional modulation of
the function of vascular growth factor receptors adjacent
to αvβ3 [13] and enhanced endothelial cell motility [14].
The thyroid hormone receptor on the integrin also has
functions in neocortex expansion in developing brain [15],
in determining lung smooth muscle phenotype [16] and in
regulating macrophage function [17].
The thyroid hormone receptor site on αvβ3 on tumor
cells and endothelial cells provides important support for
tumor-related angiogenesis, a function that is obviously
undesirable in the clinical setting. We have proposed that
these pro-angiogenic activities of iodothyronines based
at αvβ3 may limit the effectiveness of anti-angiogenic
therapy in cancer patients [14, 18], and we have shown in
vascularization models such as the chick chorioallantoic
membrane (CAM) [18] that pharmacologic or
immunologic inhibition of thyroid hormone action at αvβ3
profoundly reduces angiogenic activity of the hormone.
The integrin is expressed or activated only limitedly in
non-malignant cells and endothelial cells that are not
undergoing cell division.
At the integrin thyroid hormone receptor,
T4 is a proliferative factor as well for a number of
human cancer cell lines that have been studied in vitro
[19–22]. The role of T4 exceeds that of T3 in this regard,
in that these hormones are equipotent stimulators of
tumor cell proliferation, but the circulating levels of
free T3 are lower than those of T4. Further, in a clinical
experience involving pharmacologic induction of the
euthyroid hypothyroxinemic state in advanced cancer
patients, maintenance of normal circulating T3 levels and
euthyroidism—with substantial reduction in circulating
levels of T4—has been associated with stabilization
of the tumor or reduction in tumor size [23]. On the
other hand, differentiated and undifferentiated PC12
(pheochromocytoma) cells distinguish between T4
and T3 at αvβ3 [24], consistent with the existence of
subspecialized hormone-binding domains of the receptor
on the integrin [25].
Apoptosis is a regulated process of cell death in
nonmalignant cells and is a conscientiously pursued
therapeutic goal in oncology when the process can be
limited to tumor cells. The tumor cell has a variety of
anti-apoptotic transcriptional defenses and interacts with
its microenvironment—malignant cell-cell adhesion,
tumor cell-nonmalignant cell adhesion and tumor
cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interaction—to erect
defenses against radiotherapy and chemotherapeutic
measures that induce apoptosis [26]. The intrinsic
apoptosis pathway involves induction by chemotherapy
or radiation therapy of DNA damage and/or free
radical generation that can initiate mitochondrial death
signaling. Activated nuclear or mitochondrial p53 is
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

an important mediator of such signaling. The extrinsic
apoptosis pathway is activated by factors at the cell
surface, for example, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)
and Fas ligand [27]. The extrinsic and intrinsic pathways
(Figure 1) converge at the mitochondrial membrane
and control its porosity, but other events in apoptosis
include loss of cytoskeletal structure, breakdown of the
nuclear membrane and fragmentation of DNA. Thus, the
latter may be a primary (inducing) event in response to
radiation in the intrinsic pathway or a secondary event in
the extrinsic pathway when DNases are activated. Thyroid
hormone has anti-apoptotic actions on both the extrinsic
and intrinsic pathways. The hormone also stabilizes the
actin cytoskeleton via conversion of soluble actin to
fibrous action (F-actin) [28] and reduces DNA breakdown
by reducing caspase-activated DNase activity [29].
Against this background, it is not surprising that
thyroid hormone is anti-apoptotic in tumor cells and in
certain non-tumor cells. Anti-apoptosis may be desirable in
nondividing neurons or endothelial cells, but is an obvious
disadvantage in the setting of cancer management. Indeed,
the anti-apoptotic activity of host thyroid hormone could
contribute to chemotherapeutic resistance [30]. In this brief
analysis, we examine the evidence that thyroid hormone
is anti-apoptotic in cancer cells and the mechanisms that
are involved. For example, thyroid hormone and hormone
analogues affect the function of pro-apoptotic p53 [21];
that is, T4 blocks p53-dependent apoptosis and the T4
antagonist, and tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac) and
its formulations, facilitate apoptosis. Thyroid hormone
and certain of its analogues also affect transcription of a
variety of genes relevant to apoptosis [31–33]. This effect
includes downregulation of expression of certain caspase
genes [31]. Activated caspases are proteases essential to
apoptosis by assuring structural disorganization of the
nucleus and activation of DNAses, as well as contributing
to degradation of cytoplasmic proteins. Tetrac is proapoptotic and acts at integrin αvβ3 to upregulate caspase
gene transcription [31, 34]. The hypoxia-inducible factor1α (HIF1α) gene in cancer cells is also upregulated by
T4 [25]; the gene product has a number of defensive actions
in tumor cells, including support of anti-apoptosis [35, 36].
Other examples of the actions of hormone analogues on
apoptosis-modulating genes are discussed below.
We would also point out that thyroid hormone
deprivation is associated, not unexpectedly, with increased
apoptosis in breast cancer in the intact animal [37] and
in hepatoma cells [38]. This may relate to increased
expression of apoptosis-promoting p53 described in
tumors in hypothyroid animals [39].

and metabolism of resveratrol are rapid, underlying
the abbreviated bioavailability of the systemically
administered stilbene. A specific receptor for resveratrol
exists on the extracellular domain integrin αvβ3 [40, 41]
and is distinct from the receptor for thyroid hormone.
The existence of the cell surface receptor for resveratrol
explains why relatively brief exposure of tumor cells
to the drug nonetheless results in apoptosis [42]. We
have shown that apoptosis induced by resveratrol is
p53-dependent, requires phosphorylation of Ser-15 of p53
by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK, ERK1/2)
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and, interestingly, can involve nuclear accumulation of
an inducible pool of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) [43].
Constitutive expression of COX-2 is a biomarker of tumor
cell aggressiveness [44], but the inducible nuclear pool of
the enzyme has a wholly different function in resveratrolexposed cells [21, 43, 45, 46] in which it forms complexes
with pERK1/2, p53 and SUMO-1 to act as a co-activator
for p53-responsive genes [47].

cell apoptosis. The nuclear accumulation of COX-2 is
also inhibited [21]. These actions on resveratrol action are
rapidly initiated at the binding site for thyroid hormone on
αvβ3 [42]. The limited clinical success of resveratrol as
a cancer chemotherapeutic agent [48] has been attributed
to the limited bioavailability of the stilbene. We have
speculated instead that endogenous (host) circulating
thyroid hormone is the principal cause of ineffectiveness of
resveratrol in the clinical setting [18]. As noted in the next
sections, there are a number of anti-apoptotic mechanisms
of thyroid hormone beyond p53 activation in tumor cells.

the case. For example, T3 decreases transcription of proapoptotic BAD (Bcl-2-associated death promoter) and
upregulates anti-apoptotic BCL2 in nonmalignant cells
[52] without affecting pro-apoptotic BAX (Bcl-2-associated
X protein) or AIF (apoptosis inducing factor). Thyroid
hormone also decreases cellular abundance of caspases,
e.g., caspase-3, and of BAX [32, 39, 53], and increased
the expression of XIAP [54]. As mentioned above, the
hormone also increases expression of HIF1α, the gene
product of which has complex anti-apoptotic functions
[35, 55, 56]. The tumor growth arrest that is achieved with
imposition clinically of the euthyroid hypothyroxinemic
state mentioned above [23] is also consistent with removal
of the anti-apoptotic influence of T4.

TNF-α and Fas and thyroid hormone
The extrinsic apoptosis pathway in cancer cells
and nonmalignant cells is initiated by interaction of
so-called death-related ligands with specific receptors on
the cell surface. TNF-α and Fas ligand are such factors.
Thyroid hormone has been shown to suppress apoptosis
in trophoblast cells by decreasing expression of TNF-α
and FAS and Fas ligand genes [49]. In the same cells,
the hormone decreased the activity of caspase-3, another
anti-apoptotic action. In mouse hepatocytes, Sukocheva
and Carpenter [27] have shown that T3 is anti-apoptotic
via interference with TNF-α\Fas mechanisms. The
hormone prevented specific caspase activation and DNA
fragmentation and blocked TNF-induced cell acidification.
That acidification is an important component of the thyroid
hormone-TNF-α apoptotic pathway was shown in these
studies by pharmacologic inhibition of the Na+/H+ exchanger
(NHE1) that eliminated the anti-apoptotic effect of T3.
The exchanger is activated by T3 [50]. The intracellular
alkalinization that can be induced by thyroid hormone may
also be relevant to the function of P-glycoprotein (P-gp;
MDR1), a plasma membrane pump that exports a number
of cancer chemotherapeutic agents (see below).

Apoptosis-relevant action of thyroid
hormone on mitochondria
The recognition of the existence of anti-apoptotic
activity of the hormone and of known effects of the
hormone on mitochondrial activity [1] raised the
possibility that mitochondria-directed (intrinsic pathway)
apoptosis might be affected by iodothyronines. Mukherjee
and co-workers [57] have recently shown that T3
administration rescues hypothyroid rat liver cells from
apoptosis induced by oxidative stress that causes inner
mitochondrial membrane damage. Thus, thyroid hormone
is anti-apoptotic in this model system.
Activation of caspases that begins in the extrinsic
apoptosis pathway converges with the intrinsic pathway
at mitochondria, with disruption of the mitochondrial
membrane and freeing of cytochrome c, a hallmark
event in apoptosis. Cytochrome c release may in turn
further activate caspases. Support by thyroid hormone
of expression of the BCL2 family of genes [58, 59]
also has anti-apoptotic consequences. A principal
Bcl-2-related protein, MCL1, resides in the outer
mitochondrial membrane and binds Bak (Bcl-2
homologous antagonist/killer) and Bax proteins, thus
preventing their destabilization of the membrane. Thyroid
hormone activates expression of MCL1 [59], preventing
mitochondrial membrane destabilization and the formation
of channels by which mitochondrial cytochrome c
is released and apoptosis induced. T4 downregulates
expression of the BAX gene [58], as noted above, whose
gene product is pro-apoptotic at the mitochondrion.

Thyroid hormone action via αvβ3 on
transcription of apoptosis-relevant genes
We know that the plasma membrane thyroid
hormone/hormone analogue receptor site on the integrin
controls transcription of apoptosis-promoting genes, such
as CASP2 and BCL2L14 (Bcl-2-like protein 14), and antiapoptosis genes, such as X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis
(XIAP) and myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) [29, 34].
Tetrac blocks binding of both T4 and T3 to integrin αvβ3
[7, 25]. Tetrac and a nanoparticulate tetrac formulation
(Nanotetrac) that is excluded from the cell interior and acts
exclusively at the integrin cause suppression of XIAP and
MCL1 gene expression and induce transcription of CASP2
and BCL2L14 and other pro-apoptotic genes [7, 51]. Such
pro-apoptotic actions of the T4 inhibitor (tetrac/Nanotetrac)
are consistent with the demonstrated anti-apoptotic activity
of T4, and direct examination of the actions of T4 or T3
on apoptosis-relevant genes has indeed shown this to be

Thyroid hormone and residence time in cancer
cells of anti-apoptotic chemotherapeutic agents
Acting at the thyroid hormone receptor on integrin
αvβ3, the hormone receptor antagonist, tetrac, has been
shown to increase residence time in tumor cells of a
variety of cancer chemotherapeutic agents [60]. Among
these agents are agents with pro-apoptotic properties, such
as paclitaxel, etoposide and doxorubicin. These drugs
14738

Oncotarget

are subject to export from cells by the P-glycoprotein
(P-gp; MDR1, ABCB1) membrane pump and expression
of the MDR1 gene and pump function are both known to
be increased by thyroid hormone [61, 62]. Thus, an ‘antiapoptotic’ action of the hormone may involve shortening
of intracellular residence time and effectiveness of proapoptotic chemotherapeutic agents. We attribute the
effect of tetrac to prolong residence time in cancer cells of
doxorubicin and paclitaxel—increasing drug efficacy—to
blockade of the thyroid hormone effect on MDR1. Hypoxiainduced multidrug resistance may also be supported by
thyroid hormone via its action on HIF-1α [63].
That the hormonal effect on intracellular
concentrations of pro-apoptotic chemotherapeutic agents
is more complicated than regulation of MDR1 pump
activity is emphasized by the example of cisplatin.
Cisplatin is not a ligand of MDR1, but its intracellular
concentration is lower in thyroid hormone-treated cells
than in control cells [60]. This effect of the hormone may
involve increased activity of the organic cation transporter
that imports cisplatin into cancer cells, but this possibility
has not been examined experimentally.

TRβ that confers tumor suppressor behavior has been
identified [67], as have specific miRNAs that contribute
to TRβ-directed decreases in cancer cell proliferation and
invasiveness [68]. Mutated TRβ loses tumor suppressor
activity and may increase cell proliferation and inhibit
apoptosis [69]. Others have shown that T3 at very high
concentrations (10−6 M) induces apoptosis in human
breast cancer cells [70], apparently via TRβ-dependent
downregulation of expression in tumor cells of antiapoptotic senescence marker protein-30 gene (SMP30).
Thus, the anti-apoptotic properties of thyroid hormone
expressed by thyroid hormone by a variety of nongenomic
mechanisms—most of which originate at integrin αvβ3—
are well-substantiated, but the contributions of nuclear
receptors TRβ and TRα to regulation of apoptosis are
varied in result and appear to depend in part upon the
model systems used.

DISCUSSION
Tightly regulated apoptosis is essential to normal
tissue development, growth and maintenance of mass.
In contrast, the state of anti-apoptosis in cancer cells
permits tumor growth, and a number of pro-apoptotic
chemotherapeutic agents have been developed to
oppose cancer cells’ anti-apoptotic defense mechanisms.
Thyroid hormone is an essential factor in the regulation
of energy and protein metabolism in nonmalignant cells
and normal tissues [1]. In the setting of cancer, however,
thyroid hormone, particularly T4, acts via its cell surface
receptor on integrin αvβ3 as a proliferative factor and is
pro-angiogenic [1, 13]. Results of in vitro and of human
xenograft studies support these roles of the hormone [19,
22, 25, 71]. Clinical support for such observations comes
from medical interventions to reduce circulating levels of
thyroid hormone [23, 72], from effects of hypothyroidism
secondary to tyrosine kinase inhibitor use in patients
with renal cell carcinoma [73, 74] and from the effects of
spontaneous hypothyroidism on the clinical behavior of
breast cancer [75].
That thyroid hormone is desirably anti-apoptotic
in nonmalignant cells has been emphasized by other
authors [58, 76, 77]. We have previously reported the
presence of anti-apoptotic activity of thyroid hormone
in cancer cells, a finding that serves to engage the
hormone in cancer cell defense [20, 21, 41]. This action
of the hormone was initiated at a cell surface receptor
for thyroid hormone integrin αvβ3 and was inhibited by
tetrac or tetrac formulations. In the present review, we
have examined the molecular mechanisms by which the
hormone can be anti-apoptotic and by which tetrac or its
nanoparticulate formulation can be pro-apoptotic. What
is clear is that multiple components of the extrinsic and
intrinsic apoptosis pathways are largely modulated from
αvβ3 by thyroid hormone—chiefly, T4—at physiological
concentrations. These components include expression

Involvement of TRs in anti-apoptotic action of
thyroid hormone
The foregoing review has dealt with anti-apoptotic
activity of thyroid hormone that is initiated by nongenomic
mechanisms. However, in human hepatoma cells that
overexpress TRα, exposure to T3 has been shown to
induce resistance to apoptosis [38]. This effect may
depend at least in part upon increased expression of
Bcl-xL. Interestingly, these cells were resistant to apoptosis
despite increased transcription of tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and, in
fact, the enhanced production of TRAIL was associated
with increased, rather than decreased, metastatic potential of
the cells. Another TR-related mechanism by which thyroid
hormone is anti-apoptotic involves mitochondria studied in
nonmalignant cells by Saelim and co-workers [64]. Here,
at 10−7 M in Xenopus oocytes, T3 targeted to mitochondria
by a short form of TRβ1 decreased apoptosis dependent
upon cytochrome c release. Similar results were obtained
in primate kidney (CV-1) cells. Thus, several TR-dependent
mechanisms exist by which T3 may be anti-apoptotic,
but demonstration of the existence of these mechanisms
required supraphysiologic concentrations of T3.
In contrast, the liganded wild-type TRβ has
thyroid cancer suppressor activity, as shown by Cheng
and associates [65], and the receptor may induce
apoptosis [66]. Multiple mechanisms are involved
in tumor suppressor/pro-apoptosis effects, including
downregulation of β-catenin expression and rescue
by a nongenomic mechanism of p53 from binding to/
inactivation by SV40 large T antigen (SV40Tag). The
cellular Src kinase (cSrc) phosphorylation site on

of genes for Fas ligand, caspases, multiple members of
the Bcl-2 family and XIAP (Figure 1). Also affected is
phosphorylation of p53. As a result of the congruence of
these factors, cytochrome c release by mitochondria is
decreased. Thus, a panel of proteins is affected with roles
in apoptosis that affect the integrity of the mitochondrion.
Finally, the hormone may limit chemotherapy-induced
apoptosis by shortening intracellular residence time
of anticancer drugs that are pro-apoptotic. All of these
factors are possible clinical contributors to chemotherapy
resistance, such as that which has been modeled in vitro
in myeloma cells exposed to bortezomib and thyroid
hormone [78].
How broadly the anti-apoptotic activity of thyroid
hormone may affect chemotherapy is not yet known. It is
possible to begin to examine the extent of anti-apoptosis
with reduction in circulating levels of host cancer patient
T4 while maintaining normal blood levels of T3 [23]. It
may also be possible in the future to block the antiapoptotic and other cancer support actions of T4 at integrin
αvβ3 with pharmaceutical agents [7, 21], and monitor
effectiveness of existing cancer chemotherapeutic drugs
with pro-apoptotic properties.
