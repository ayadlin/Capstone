Abstract
Although asbestos causes malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), rising from
lung mesothelium, the molecular mechanism has not been suggested until now.
Extremely low mutation rate in classical tumor suppressor genes (such as p53 and
pRb) and oncogenes (including Ras or myc) indicates that there would be MPM-specific
carcinogenesis pathway. To address this, we treated silica to mimic mesothelioma
carcinogenesis in mesothelioma and non-small cell lung cancer cell lines (NSCLC).
Treatment of silica induced p-Erk and Snail through RKIP reduction. In addition, p53
and E-cadherin were decreased by silica-treatment. Elimination of Snail restored p53
expression. We found that NF2 (frequently deleted in MPM) inhibited Snail-mediated
p53 suppression and was stabilized by RKIP. Importantly, GN25, an inhibitor of p53Snail interaction, induced p53 and apoptosis. These results indicate that MPM can be
induced by reduction of RKIP/NF2, which suppresses p53 through Snail. Thus, the
p53-Snail binding inhibitor such as GN25 is a drug candidate for MPM.

Introduction

low genetic mutation rate in p53 and related signaling
components such as MDM2 or p14/ARF [8, 14]. This fact
indicates that asbestos or silica may inactivate p53 and
activate oncogenes through unusual strategy.
To investigate how MPM gains malignant features
without classical genetic mutations, we checked the effect
of silica on tumorigenic progression. Although asbestos
is more suitable agent for this study, tight restriction for
usage of asbestos, we were not able to use asbestos. From
the analysis of silica effect, we found that silica itself
could reduce p53 expression and Raf kinase inhibitory
protein, RKIP. In addition, reduced RKIP was closely
related with p53 reduction by Snail and NF2 stabilization.
Finally, we revealed that inhibition of Snail-p53
interaction could restore the tumor suppressive role of p53
in MPM cell line. These results would provide new insight
for understanding of MPM carcinogenesis as well as new
strategy for treatment of MPM.

Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM) is asbestosinduced advanced lung cancer with very poor survival rate
[1, 2]. Despite tight-regulation against asbestos, due to
wide-used asbestos as insulator in constructions, incidence
of MPM will be sustained for considerable period [3-5].
In addition, other materials such as silica and nano-carbon
tube are considered to be potential tread for MPM [6,
7]. However, molecular carcinogenic mechanism about
asbestos or similar micro-materials-induced mesothelioma
has not been clearly demonstrated until now. From the
global genetic analysis, Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2/merlin)
and BRCA1 associated protein 1 (BAP1) are represented
as frequently altered genes in MPM [8-10]. In addition,
chronic inflammation by trapped asbestos or silica is
suggested as risk factor [11, 12]. But, in aspect of human
carcinogenesis, there is no obvious oncogenic mutation
that should provide driving force for tumorigenesis and
loss of function in tumor suppressor genes in particular
p53 pathway [13]. In fact, it is generally accepted concept
that, to progress to malignant cancer, p53 pathway
should be inactivated. However, MPM shows extremely

K-ras mutated cell lines (A549 and H460), in spite of
wild type Ras [17, 18]. Thus, we checked the effect of
silica on expression of p-Erk in A549 and MPM cell
lines. Treatment of silica on serum free condition could
induce p-Erk at early phase and reduced at late phase in
A549. However, p-Erk in MPM was not reduced even
in late phase (Figure 1B). Consistently with p-Erk, cell
proliferation in A549 was induced from 6 hr and declined
from 24 hr (Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure 1A).
However, silica did not alter the cell proliferation in MPM
cell lines (Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure 1A).
These results indicate that there is defect in regulation of
Erk activity in MPM. So, we first tested the involvement

Induction of p-Erk in response to silica
To obtain the basic information about MPM, we
measured the expression of p53 and Erk activation. In
two kinds of MPM cell lines, p53 showed quite different
expression pattern (Figure 1A). H28 showed very low p53
expression and H2452 expressed small sized p53, despite
genetically wild type (Figure 1A) [15, 16]. However,
p-Erk expression in MPM was elevated as strongly as

Figure 1: Induction of p-Erk by silica. (A) p-Erk is elevated in MPM cell lines as strong as K-Ras mutated cell lines. A549 and
H460 are K-Ras mutated cell lines. SCLC cell lines (H69, H209, H146) were used for negative control, because of absence of Ras-related
mutation. Indicated protein levels were analyzed by WB. Erk activation was determined by anti-p-Erk specific Ab. t-Erk indicated total
Erk. Actin was used for loading control. (B) Silica induces p-Erk in A549. Activation of Erk was monitored by WB analysis with p-Erk
after treatment for indicated time in A549 and MPM cell lines. (C) Silica promotes A549 growth at early phase and did not alter the MPM
cell line’s growth. Cells were seeded at 5x105 cell/well and incubated with 10 µg/ml silica for indicated time. Cell count was performed by
tryphan blue dye exclusive using hemocytometer by two independent researchers. (D) Inhibition of RTK using Iressa/tarceva combination
treatment did not block the p-Erk increase. RTK inhibitor (10 µM) was treated for 24hr and silica was treated after 1 hr. Actin was used as
loading control. (E) MAPK inhibitors cannot suppress silica-induced p-Erk, and silica suppress DNA damage-induced p53. H28 showed
the induction of p53 in response to Adr, indicating that this cell line possesses wild type p53. PD98059 (5 µg/ml), U0126 (2 µM), silica and
Adriamycin (2 µg/ml) were treated for 24 hr. WB analysis was performed, and Actin was used as loading control.

of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation through
the combination treatment of RTK inhibitors (Iressa
and tarceva). However, although they could suppress
basal p-Erk, silica-induced p-Erk was not blocked by
them (Figure 1D). Next, we checked the activation of
Erk under MEK1/2 inhibitors treated condition. Despite
obvious reduction of basal p-Erk in both cell lines,
p-Erk was induced in A549 by silica-treatment under
MEK1/2 inhibitor-treated condition (Figure 1E). This
result indicates that silica can regulate downstream factor
of MEK1/2. Thus, PD98059 or U0126 did not show
obvious growth suppression effect on MPM cell lines
(Supplementary Figure 1B and 1C). Moreover, p53 was
increased by treatment of Adriamycin in H28, similarly

to A549 (Figure 1E), implying that H28 possesses wild
type p53.

RKIP is responsible for p-Erk induction by silica
Since p-Erk is regulated by downstream factor of
MEK1/2, we assumed the involvement of RKIP on silicainduced Erk activation and MPM progression. Although
it has been reported as inhibitor of Raf-1 [19, 20], RKIP
can also inhibit MEK1/2 via direct interaction [21]. To test
this, we measured the expression of RKIP in silica-treated
NSCLC cell lines and observed the reduction of RKIP
(Figure 2A) as dosage dependent manner (Figure 2B). To

Silica was treated for 24 hr in SF condition. The expression of endogenous RKIP was determined by an RKIP specific Ab. (B) RKIP is
reduced by silica as dosage-dependent manner. Silica was treated for 24 hr in SF condition. Reversely with RKIP reduction, p-Erk induction
was detected as dosage dependent manner. (C) The reduction of RKIP by silica is general event. Non-cancerous human lung epithelial cell
lines (WI26 and L132) were incubated with silica (24 hr). WB analysis was performed with indicated antibodies. Similarly with previous
result, mutual exclusive expression of RKIP and p-Erk was observed in both cell lines. Actin was used as loading control. (D) Compared to
several lung cancer cell line, RKIP transcript is very low in H28 cell line. RT-PCR was performed with matched specific primers. GAPDH
was used as loading control. (E) Translational level of RKIP is also low in MPM cell lines. RKIP expression level was monitored by WB
analysis. Actin was used as loading control. (F) RKIP forms small spots in cytoplasm of H28. H28 cells were stained with RKIP (green),
DAPI (blue) and ER (red).

extend this, we also measured the expression of RKIP in
non-transformed lung cells and obtained the same result
(Figure 2C). Even in non-lung cancer cell lines such as
HCT116 (colon) and AGS (Stomach), RKIP was reduced
by silica-treatment (Supplementary Figure S2A). To
know how silica suppress RKIP expression, we checked
the protein turnover and transcriptional regulation.
Proteasome inhibitor did not block the RKIP reduction
(Supplementary Figure S2B), whereas RKIP transcript
was obviously decreased by silica (Supplementary
Figure S2C). So, we next examined the expression of
RKIP in MPM, NSCLC and SCLC cell lines and found
that similarly with silica-treated cells, RKIP transcript as
well as protein level were very low in H28 (Figure 2D
and 2E). In addition, several NSCLC cell lines showed
the low RKIP expression at protein level (Figure 2E). In
immunostaining analysis, we found that RKIP in MPM
was located in cytosol as small spots (Figure 2F and
Supplementary Figure S2D). Considering other’s reports
that RKIP is diffused in cytoplasm [22], this feature would
be reflected the non-functional portion of RKIP. Indeed,
blocking of lysosomal degradation by Bafilomycin
A could induce cytoplasmic diffused RKIP as well as
protein expression (Supplementary Figure S2E and F).
However, autophagy inhibitors (3-MA or rapamycin) did
not suppress RKIP spotting (Supplementary Figure S2E
and F), suggested that in H28, RKIP was continuously
eliminated by lysosomal degradation.

H28 showed the cytoplasmic spotted p53 (Figure 3E),
whereas H2452 showed the cytoplasmic diffused p53
(Supplementary Figure S3D). Similarly with silicatreated cells, ectopic RKIP expression could induce p53
expression in H28 but not H2452 (Figure 3F). Considering
these results, H2452 would be developed by different
mechanism from RKIP inhibition. In fact, H28 and H2452
are different pathological types (sarcomatoid vs epithelial
MPM). Thus, we focused on H28 and re-transfected RKIP
into H28. Overexpressed RKIP was located in cytoplasm
(Figure 3G and 3H) and induced p53 expression in nucleus
(Figure 3G and 3H).

Snail is responsible for p53 reduction in H28
Since silica promoted the formation of cytoplasmic
small vesicular p53 (Figure 3C) and H28 also showed
the similar feature (Figure 3E), we assumed that the
Snail would be involved in p53 suppression mechanism.
In fact, we have revealed that Snail can eliminate p53
by direct interaction and exocytosis [24, 25]. We also
observed that the reduction of p53 was not blocked by
MG132 (Supplementary Figure 2B), also supporting
our hypothesis [25]. As we expected, treatment of silica
could induce Snail (Figure 4A) and Snail expression
showed the mutual exclusive pattern with RKIP following
incubation time (Figure 4B). In addition, we observed
the increase of exogenously transfected Snail by silica
(Figure 4C), indicating that Snail would be regulated at
post-transcription level. Moreover, Snail transfection did
not alter the RKIP reduction, whereas RKIP transfection
could block the Snail induction (Figure 4D). These results
strongly suggest that RKIP is first and most-upstream
regulator in silica-induced signaling cascade. Indeed,
MPM cell lines showed the elevated expression of Snail
(Figure 4E). Moreover, elimination of Snail using siRNA
[25] could induce p53 expression in H28 (Figure 4F).
So, we tested the favorable effect of GN25, the
small chemical inhibitor of Snail-p53 binding, on MPM
cell lines. Treatment of GN25 could induce p53 more
obviously in H28 (Figure 4G and 4H), comparing to
positive control cell line A549. However, H2452 did not
show the induction of p53 in response to GN25 (Figure
4G). Consistently with p53 induction, cell viability was
also decreased by GN25 in H28 and A549 (Figure 4I).
Although we observed partial reduction of cell viability
in H2452 by GN25, it seems to be not related with p53
(Figure 4I). Indeed, GN25 can induce cell death partially
via p73, family protein of p53 (unpublished data).

RKIP regulates p53
In previous, we showed that RKIP is a transcriptional
target of p53 [23]. Thus, we speculated that reduction of
p53 would be one of reason for RKIP reduction. To test
this, we first examined the relevance between p53 status
and RKIP reduction by silica. In fact, silica could suppress
p53 and RKIP expression in A549 (Supplementary Figure
S3A) despite prevention of proteasome degradation
(Supplementary Figure S3B), suggesting that reduction of
p53 by silica might be achieved by MDM2-independent
mechanism. However, RKIP reduction by silica did not
show any relationship with p53 status (Figure 3A). For
example, RKIP was reduced in p53 null H1299 and
mutated H23. Instead, transfection of RKIP could increase
p53 expression as dosage-dependent manner (Figure 3B).
Through IF staining with p53 Ab, we observed that p53
was localized in cytoplasmic droplet when silica was
treated (Supplementary Figure S3C). This feature is very
similar with Snail-mediated p53 suppression [24]. Thus,
we modified our hypothesis that RKIP would be upstream
of p53 and tested that RKIP could block the silicamediated p53 suppression. Ectopic expression of RKIP
could be retained in nucleus (Figure 3C) and block the
p53 reduction (Figure 3D).
So we next checked the localization of p53 in
H28 and H2452. Consistently with silica-treated cells,

demonstrated. So, we checked the interaction between
RKIP and Snail. However, we did not observe the
interaction (Supplementary Figure S4A). So we searched
additional factor that could link RKIP and Snail and tested
the involvement of NF2 that is also known to be frequently
mutated in MPM and related with MAPK signaling and
migration [26-28]. In A549, silica could suppressed the
expression of transfected NF2 as strongly as RKIP (Figure
5A). In addition, NF2 in H28 was rapidly degraded by
proteasome (Supplementary Figure S4B). In fact, RKIP
could induce NF2 expression, whereas Snail suppress it
(Figure 5B). We also observed the elimination of Snail
when NF2 was co-transfected (Figure 5B). To confirm
this, we co-transfected NF2 and Snail in A549 and 293
cells and found that NF2 as well as Snail were obviously
reduced when they were co-transfected (Figure 5C and
Supplementary Figure S4C). To get more detail evidence
about reduction of Snail and NF2, we transfected Snail
as dose dependently into NF2 transfected cells and found
that NF2 expression was gradually decreased following
expression of Snail (Supplementary Figure S4D).
Reversely, dose-dependent decrease of Snail could be
detected by increase of NF2 transfection (Supplementary
Figure S4E). In addition, p53 reduction (Figure 5C) and
p-Erk induction by silica and Snail (Supplementary Figure
S4C) were abolished by NF2 transfection. These results
indicate that reduction of NF2 is important for silica/snailmediated Erk activation and p53 suppression. In fact, NF2
could induce p53 expression (Figure 5D). Considering that
proteasome inhibitor (ALLN) could block the reduction
of Snail and NF2 (Figure 5E), low expression of NF2 in
MPM (in particular, H28) would be resulted from Snail
expression. To test this, we checked the expression of NF2
in si-Snail transfected H28 and found that consistently
with p53 induction, NF2 was increased by Si-Snail (Figure
5F). Moreover, transfection of NF2 into H28 could induce
p53 expression in nucleus (Figure 5G). These results
indicate that, in MPM, low expression of NF2, which
would be resulted from RKIP reduction, would be reason
for p53 inactivation and snail elevation.

Increase of Snail could reduce the interaction of NF2
and RKIP (Figure 6D), whereas RKIP did not diminish
the binding of Snail and NF2 (Figure 6E), indicating
that Snail-NF2 binding is stronger than RKIP-NF2 and
increase of Snail by additional signaling such as TGF-β
or MAPK activation [29, 30] might reduce RKIP-NF2
binding, resulted in destabilization of NF2. In contrast,
increase of NF2 could sequester the Snail and recover
the p53 from Snail-mediated inactivation. In fact, NF2
(full length as well as N-terminal region) could block the
interaction of Snail and p53 (Figure 6F).

Discussion
Human malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is
known to be induced by inhalation of asbestos. However,
until now, clear molecular carcinogenesis model has not
been established. Our main concern is how human MPM is
evoked. Since asbestos cannot be supplied by commercial
company, we tested the biological effect of silica. In
fact, despite so many kinds of genetic studies, oncogenic
mutations, responding to MPM cell proliferation, has not
been proposed. Since asbestos or silica, once inhaled,
are not eradicated, we assumed that existence of these
materials itself would be one of tumorigenic force and
may replace genetic mutation such as p53 or pRb. In fact,
treatment of silica could induce p-Erk (Figure 1B) that
is one of character of MPM [31]. As the mechanism for
p-Erk increase, we observed the RKIP reduction (Figure
2). Although RKIP is well known inhibitor of Raf kinase, it
can also block the MEK1/2 activation [32]. In fact, silicainduced p-Erk was not suppressed by MEK1/2 inhibitors
(Figure 1E). Thus, RKIP is one of very plausible target.
Moreover, RKIP reduction by silica seemed to be very
general event, even in non-cancer cell lines (Figure 2C).
Although, until now, we do not know clear mechanism
about RKIP reduction by silica, continuous existence
of silica can suppress RKIP expression and may drive
transformation to MPM.
In previous report, RKIP has been suggested as
important target gene for p53-induced senescence [23]. In
fact, RKIP can promote cellular senescence in response
to genotoxic stress-p53 pathway. However, in this study,
we found that RKIP could work as upstream activator of
p53. Indeed, overexpression of RKIP could increase p53
expression in A549 (Figure 5B). However, this result
should be carefully interpreted because A549 possesses
oncogenic K-Ras and basically, p53 is suppressed by Snail
[25]. In fact, RKIP-mediated p53 induction is achieved by
inhibition of Snail by RKIP-NF2 network and not general
event in other kinds of cells.
Concerning low mutation of p53 in MPM, this study
provides basic clues. In H28, p53 is inhibited by Snail.
In fact, p53 was restored by si-snail (Figure 4F), RKIP
transfection (Figure 3F), treatment of GN25 (Figure 4G
and 4H) or NF2 overexpression (Figure 5G). Since H28

NF2 blocks Snail-p53 interaction
To know the working mechanism of NF2 in RKIP
and Snail linkage, we performed the GST-pull down
assay and found that RKIP could associate with NF2
through N-terminal region (Figure 6A) and Snail was also
interacted with NF2 (Figure 6B). However, Snail-RKIP
interaction was not detected in this assay, consistently with
previous result (Supplementary Figure S4A). To confirm
the interaction, we performed the IP analysis. Consistently
with our GST-pull down results, interaction between NF2
and Snail was increased by silica-treatment, whereas
RKIP-NF2 binding was reduced (Figure 6C). Since RKIP
and Snail were commonly associated with N-terminal
region of NF2, we tested the competition between them.

is classified as sarcomatoid (10-20 % of MPM) [33, 34],
that is very aggressive and less responding to chemical
treatment, GN25 would be one of drug candidate for H28
like MPM. Although we also observed the reduction of
cell viability in H2452 by GN25 (Figure 4I), it would be
resulted from p53 independent mechanism. In fact, GN25
can activate p73-mediated apoptosis (unpublished data).
Thus, we next checked the involvement of p73 in GN25induced cell death in H2452.
In this study, we also revealed the novel function
of NF2, inhibitor of snail. In fact, NF2 is one frequently
mutated genes in MPM. However, its molecular role has
not been clearly demonstrated. NF2 is linked various cell
signaling including cell-cell junction and Hippo pathway
[35]. Indeed, we could observe the increase of cell size
by NF2 transfection (Figure 5G) that is one of important
feature of Hippo pathway [35]. However, in this study,
NF2 was cellular inhibitor of Snail, in particular, Snailmediated p53 suppression. Under normal condition,
NF2 may inhibit Snail to prevent cell migration. This

speculation is very plausible because NF2 is tightly linked
to cell-cell adhesion and works as migration inhibitor [28,
35]. If RKIP is reduced by silica or other reasons, NF2
would be reduced by destabilization. In contrast, under
the RKIP induced condition (such as p53 activation), NF2
may be stabilized and inhibit Snail-mediated p53 and
E-cadherin suppression (Figure 7). In MPM model, RKIP
reduction or inactivation by cytosolic aggregation (Figure
2F) and rapid digestion in lysosome (Supplementary
Figure 2E and F) may weaken NF2 function. In addition,
if Snail is elevated by several triggers (For example;
activation of TGF-β signaling [29, 30], RKIP reduction
in MPM or K-Ras activation in pancreatic cancer [25]),
the interaction of RKIP and NF2 (Figure 6E) would be
disrupted and p53 is suppressed (Figure 7).
Our results are consistent with previous hypothesis
that cytotoxic stresses (in our case, silica or asbestos)
provide selective pressure and resistant clones against this
pressure by genetic or non-genetic signaling alternation
(RKIP reduced or NF2 mutated cells) would be founder of

Figure 7: Summarized Diagram. (A) Under normal condition, RKIP block the Snail through MAPK inhibition and NF2 stabilization.

Thus, p53 and E-cadherin exert tumor suppressive functions. (B) When silica or asbestos are inhaled, they suppress RKIP and sequentially
reduce NF2 stability. Inactivation of RKIP-NF2 network might induce Snail-mediated p53 suppression as well as E-cadherin downregulation. Thus, long-term exposure to silica or asbestos will evoke mesothelioma.

cancer [36]. In fact, treatment of silica in A549 obviously
suppresses cell proliferation. However, reduction of RKIP
provides resistance to silica and enable to clonal selection.
So, at early stage of MPM, many cells would be eliminated
by silica-induced toxicity. However, small clones that
express low RKIP will be selected and expanded to MPM.
In summary, in human MPM, silica or asbestos
that is retained in lung may provide the tumor-promoting
ability through reduction of RKIP (Figure 7). Since NF2
expression is dependent on RKIP, RKIP reduction may
promote NF2 inactivation, sequentially induce Snail.
Activated Snail will bind and inhibit p53 and also block
the RKIP-NF2 binding. Long-term exposure of silica/
asbestos, finally, induce invasive cancer because of
E-cadherin reduction. Thus, Snail-p53 binding inhibitor
such as GN25 or Snail inhibitor would be useful for
treatment of MPM.

Immunofluorescence staining
Cells grown on coated cover glasses were fixed
with 100% MeOH for 1 hr at -20 oC. After washing
with Phosphate bufferd saline (PBS) and blocking in
PBS based buffer (containing normal human IgG (1:
200; 30 min at 4 oC)) to eliminate non-specific reaction,
cells were incubated with primary antibodies (1: 100~1:
200; overnight at 4 oC) and sequentially with suitable
either FITC (Fluorescein isothiocyanate) or Rhodamineconjugated secondary antibodies for 6 hr at room
temperature. DNA was stained with 4, 6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI). Endoplasmic reticulum was stained
by ER-TrackerTM dye (Invitrogen, California, USA,
MP12353). After washing with PBS, cover glasses were
mounted with mounting solution (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA, USA; H-5501). Immunofluorescence
(IF) signal was detected through fluorescence microscope
(Zeizz, Jena, Germany).

Recombinant proteins, immunoprecipitation and
GST pull-down assays
For the analysis of protein-protein interaction,
Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-pull down assay and
Immunoprecipitation (IP) assay were performed. For
GST-pull down, agarose-bead conjugated GST (negative
control) or GST-target protein was incubated with
cell lysate or recombinant protein in RIPA buffer for
1 h at 4°C. IP assay was performed with cell lysate or
recombinant protein with RIPA buffer. The whole lysates
were incubated with proper first antibodies for 2 hr at
4°C and reacted with agarose bead conjugated protein
A/G (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 2 h. After
centrifugation, precipitated materials were washed with
RIPA buffer twice and subjected into SDS-PAGE and WB
analysis.

Western blot analysis
Protein was extracted from cells in RIPA buffer
(150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris-Cl, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium
deoxycholate, 0.1% Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS),
containing protease inhibitor cocktail). After sample
buffer was added to lysates, the mixtures were heated at
95 oC for 7 min. Samples were applied to Sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
and western blot (WB) analysis was performed according
to general protocol. The following antibodies were used in
