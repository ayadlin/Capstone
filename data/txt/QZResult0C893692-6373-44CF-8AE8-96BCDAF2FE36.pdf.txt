ABSTRACT
Epi-reevesioside F, a new cardiac glycoside isolated from the root of Reevesia
formosana, displayed potent activity against glioblastoma cells. Epi-reevesioside F
was more potent than ouabain with IC50 values of 27.3±1.7 vs. 48.7±1.8 nM (P <
0.001) and 45.0±3.4 vs. 81.3±4.3 nM (P < 0.001) in glioblastoma T98 and U87 cells,
respectively. However, both Epi-reevesioside F and ouabain were ineffective in A172
cells, a glioblastoma cell line with low Na+/K+-ATPase α3 subunit expression. Epireevesioside F induced cell cycle arrest at S and G2 phases and apoptosis. It also
induced an increase of intracellular concentration of Na+ but not Ca2+, cleavage and
exposure of N-terminus of Bak, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, inhibition
of Akt activity and induction of caspase cascades. Potassium supplements significantly
inhibited Epi-reevesioside F-induced effects. Notably, Epi-reevesioside F caused
cytosolic acidification that was highly correlated with the anti-proliferative activity.
In summary, the data suggest that Epi-reevesioside F inhibits Na+/K+-ATPase, leading
to overload of intracellular Na+ and cytosolic acidification, Bak activation and loss
of mitochondrial membrane potential. The PI3-kinase/Akt pathway is inhibited and
caspase-dependent apoptosis is ultimately triggered in Epi-reevesioside F-treated
glioblastoma cells.

INTRODUCTION

homeostasis can be an anticancer strategy. It has been
documented that cardiac glycosides, including bufotalin,
oleandrin, ouabain and digoxin and their derivatives,
induce anti-proliferative and apoptotic activities in cancer
cells through an increase of intracellular Ca2+ levels [35]. Ca2+-independent signaling pathways also have been
reported, such as oxidative stress [6], inhibition of NFκB and AP-1 [7], an increase of FasL expression [7, 8],
inhibition of topoisomerases [3], and down-regulation
of pro-survival Bcl-2 family members [9] and protooncogene c-myc expression [10, 11].
Ion transport and intracellular pH are important
in numerous cell functions, including cell membrane

Cardiac glycosides are a class of steroid-like
compounds and have a long history in the treatment of
cardiac diseases, such as congestive heart failure and
arrhythmia. Inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase by cardiac
glycosides leads to intracellular Na+ overload which in
turn drives Ca2+ influx into cells [1]. Appropriate increase
of intracellular Ca2+ levels in cardiac cells results in an
increase of contractility. However, intracellular Ca2+
overload may cause cell death since Ca2+ participates in
signaling pathways of apoptosis and necrosis [2]. Because

activity, DNA synthesis, cell proliferation, differentiation,
oncogenesis, malignant transformation and metastasis
[12, 13]. Aberrant regulation of H+ dynamics occurs in
almost all tumors. Tumors, by using multiple ways for
ion transport, create extracellular acid microenvironment
while maintain alkaline intracellular pH, promoting
survival, progression and metastasis [12-14]. Alkaline
intracellular pH also contributes to chemotherapy
resistance [15, 16]. Establishment of this self-defensive/
anti-apoptotic mechanism is predominantly through antiacidifying effect caused by hyperactivity of membranebound H+ extrusion transporters [17]. Many studies have
suggested that intracellular acidification resulted from
chemotherapeutic drugs is responsible for an early onset
of malignant cell apoptosis [17-19]. Accordingly, H+
extrusion transporters are potential targets for anticancer
strategy [17].
Recently, bioassay-guided fractionation of the root
of Reevesia formosana resulted in the isolation of new
cardiac glycosides with anti-proliferative and apoptotic
activities in our work [11, 20, 21]. In this study, Epireevesioside F has been examined to display potent antiproliferative activity in glioblastoma cells, leading to Bak
activation, mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. The
signaling pathways related to ion transport and cytosolic
acidification have been identified to demonstrate the
anticancer potential of Epi-reevesioside F.

major population was the second and the third generation
after seeding cells for 24 and 48 h, respectively. However,
the population distribution significantly shifted to the
parent and the second generation after the exposure to
Epi-reevesioside F, respectively, confirming its antiproliferative activity (Figure 1C).

RESULTS

Epi-reevesioside F increases intracellular Na+
concentrations

Epi-reevesioside F displays anti-proliferative
activity against both T98 and U87 cells

Several lines of evidence have suggested that
cells may accumulate in G1/S and G2 phases under
hyperosmotic stress [24, 25]. Because Epi-reevesioside
F induced cell cycle arrest at both S and G2/M phases
and inhibited cell proliferation, the intracellular Na+
concentrations were examined. The data demonstrated that
both Epi-reevesioside F and ouabain caused significant
increases of intracellular Na+ concentrations (Figure 3A),
which were almost completely abolished by extracellular
potassium supplements (Figure 3B). Furthermore, both
Epi-reevesioside F- and ouabain-induced inhibition of
cell proliferation in T98 and U87 cells was significantly
rescued by extracellular potassium supplements (Figure
4).
The rise of intracellular Na+ concentrations
induced by inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase may drive the
influx of Ca2+ through Na+/Ca2+ exchange system [1].
Intracellular Ca2+ overload can lead to cell death because
Ca2+ participates in a variety of cell death programs [2].
Flow cytometric analysis of fluo-3 staining showed that
both Epi-reevesioside F and ouabain did not modify
intracellular Ca2+ concentrations (Supplementary Figure
2).

Epi-reevesioside F induces cell cycle arrest and
differential apoptotic regulation between T98 and
U87 cells
Flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide
staining revealed that both Epi-reevesioside F and ouabain
induced concentration-dependent arrest of cell cycle at S
and G2/M phases associated with apoptosis in T98 cells
(Figure 2A). In contrast, only a moderate increase of G2/M
phase arrest was triggered in U87 cells (Figure 2B). DNA
damage or DNA replication stress can activate several
key kinases that induce cell cycle arrest predominantly at
S and G2 phases to facilitate DNA repair [23]. Several
downstream targets induced by DNA damage were
examined, including Chk kinase, γ-H2A.X and replication
protein A (RPA, protein complex associating with singlestranded DNA). The data showed that Epi-reevesioside
F did not stimulate these cellular targets (Supplementary
Figure 1) indicating that DNA was not a primary target for
Epi-reevesioside F.

Both Epi-reevesioside F and ouabain induced
concentration-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation
in T98 and U87 cells using sulforhodamine B assay. Epireevesioside F was more potent than ouabain with IC50
values of 27.3±1.7 vs. 48.7±1.8 nM (P < 0.001) and
45.0±3.4 vs. 81.3±4.3 nM (P < 0.001) in T98 and U87
cells, respectively (Figure 1A). Both compounds were
ineffective in A172 cells. Cardiac glycosides have been
suggested to show distinct affinities toward Na+/K+ATPase α-isoforms [22]. The detection of α-isoforms
protein levels demonstrated that the expression of α3subunit was much lower in A172 than that in T98 and U87
cells (Figure 1B). Several cell lines were also examined
with varied expression levels of Na+/K+-ATPase α3subunit (Figure 1B). Epi-reevesioside F-induced antiproliferative effects were identified to have a high
correlation (r2 = 0.96) with α3-subunit expressions. The
inhibition of cell proliferation was further confirmed by
CFSE assay. The data in Figure 1C demonstrated that the

Epi-reevesioside F decreases intracellular pH and
inhibits cell proliferation

which govern cell survival [26, 27]. Flow cytometric
analysis of fluorescent dye seminaphtharhodafluor-1
staining showed that Epi-reevesioside F induced timeand concentration-dependent intracellular acidification in
T98 cells (Figure 5A). Confocal microscopic examination
also demonstrated similar intracellular pH-lowering effect
(Figure 5B). The correlation between intracellular pH and
cell proliferation was determined with a high correlation
coefficient (r2 = 0.98, Supplementary Figure 3), revealing
that intracellular acidity could be a key factor in Epi-

The relationship between changes in intracellular pH
and cell proliferation has attracted attention in anticancer
researches. It has been suggested that cytoplasmic
acidification may blunt proliferation and promote
apoptosis in various cancer cell lines through a decrease
of protein synthesis and influence of signaling pathways

reevesioside F-induced effect.
Sodium/hydrogen exchangers (NHEs) constitute
a large family of integral membrane protein transporters
responsible for counter transport of H+ and Na+. The
expression of NHE isoform 1 (NHE1) is ubiquitous.
NHE1 activation is sensitive to intracellular acidic pH and
is rapidly induced upon a drop of cytosolic pH [28]. The
effect of Epi-reevesioside F on NHE1 activity was studied
using immunoprecipitation analysis because the binding
of 14-3-3 to NHE1 has been identified to be associated
with the activation of Na+/H+ exchange [29]. As a result,
Epi-reevesioside F significantly increased the association
between NHE1 and 14-3-3, indicating an increase of

NHE1 activity (Supplementary Figure 4). The data support
the intracellular acidification to Epi-reevesioside F action.

Epi-reevesioside F induces mitochondrial damage
and caspase-dependent apoptosis
Intracellular acidification has been suggested to
be responsible for mitochondrial dysfunction and both
caspase-dependent and -independent apoptosis under
several apoptotic stimuli [30]. Furthermore, a decrease
of intracellular pH may stimulate several acid DNases
to promote cell death in many apoptotic conditions [31].

Mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψm) was determined
using JC-1 staining. The data demonstrated that Epireevesioside F induced a concentration-dependent increase
of JC-1 monomers (green fluorescence) indicating a loss
of ∆Ψm and mitochondrial damage (Figure 6). The effect
was significantly inhibited by extracellular potassium
supplements (Figure 6).
In cells of neural and non-neural origins, tubulin
may form a complex with Na+/K+-ATPase to regulate
enzyme activity. Acetylated tubulin has been identified
to be associated with Na+/K+-ATPase and to block the
catalytic activity of the pump [32]. Both Epi-reevesioside
F and ouabain induced a rapid and time-dependent
increase of α-tubulin acetylation (Figure 7A). Further
identification showed that both cardiac glycosides caused
a profound decrease of protein expression of Na+/K+ATPase α3 subunit and phosphorylated Akt (Ser473), and
induced activation of caspase-9 and -3 and cleavage of
PARP-1, a caspase-3 substrate (Figure 7B). Bak, a pro-

apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, localizes to mitochondria
and serves as an apoptotic inducer. After proteolysis, the
cleaved Bak reveals a zinc binding site which regulates
Bak activity through dimerization [33]. As a result,
both Epi-reevesioside F and ouabain induced a dramatic
increase of cleaved Bak formation (Figure 7B). Moreover,
flow cytometric analysis showed that Epi-reevesioside F
significantly enhanced the exposure of N terminus of Bak,
suggesting an increase of Bak activity (Figure 7C).

DISCUSSION
Several components have been isolated from the
root of Reevesia formosana, including Epi-reevesioside
F, reevesioside A, reevesioside D and reevesioside F.
The anti-proliferative activities of these components
against glioblastoma cell lines, A172, T98 and U87, were
determined. The data demonstrated that all components
showed little activities in A172 cells. In contrast, Epi-

reevesioside F, reevesioside A and reevesioside F
showed potent activities against T98 and U87 cells.
Notably, Epi-reevesioside F exhibited higher activities
(about two times) than ouabain, while reevesioside A
and reevesioside F were equipotent to ouabain, in these
two cell lines. Reevesioside D was ineffective in all cell
lines. Therefore, Epi-reevesioside F has been selected
for anti-glioblastoma study. Na+/K+-ATPase serves as
a multifunctional signal transducer and integrator and
is responsible for maintaining resting potential and
in regulating cellular volume, contractility, adhesion,
inflammation and apoptosis [11, 21, 34, 35]. The
aberrant expression and activity of Na+/K+-ATPase have
been implicated in the progression of several types of
aggressive cancers. α1 and α3 subunits of Na+/K+-ATPase
are frequently overexpressed in colorectal cancer, nonsmall cell lung cancer, melanomas and glioblastomas [3638]. Targeting α1 and α3 subunits has been suggested to
trigger both apoptosis- and non-apoptosis related death in
cancer cells [11, 21, 36-38] and in cells with multidrugresistant phonotype [39]. It suggests that Na+/K+-ATPase
is a crucial target for development of anticancer agents.
Epi-reevesioside F displayed potent anti-glioblastoma
activity and Na+/K+-ATPase α3 subunit was important in
determining this activity. Moreover, Epi-reevesioside F
induced profound down-regulation of the α3 subunit. It
has been suggested that both endogenous and exogenously
applied cardiac glycosides can induce internalization and
lysosomal degradation of the ligated Na+/K+-ATPase and
eliminate the pump through a conformational change of
the protein itself [40]. The data further supported that Na+/
K+-ATPase α3 subunit served as a primary target of Epireevesioside F. In addition to α3 subunit, the protein levels
of other subunits, including α1, α2 and β1, also have been
examined. The data demonstrated varied levels of subunit
expressions in different cell lines (supplementary figure 5).
Notably, A172 cells expressed high levels of α1, α2 and
β1 subunits. However, Epi-reevesioside F did not show
activity on the inhibition of A172 proliferation. Similar
low effect but high expression of α1 subunit expression
was obtained in H9c2 cells to Epi-reevesioside F action.
Overall, Epi-reevesioside F-induced anti-proliferative
effects in these cell lines were highly correlated to the
expression of α3 subunit but not α1 or α2 subunit.
Microtubules are highly dynamic polymers involved
in a variety of cellular processes, such as cell division,
differentiation and signal transduction. α-tubulin and
β-tubulin are two major members of tubulin superfamily
making up microtubule. Tubulin acetylation, a posttranslational modification, may help recruit molecular
chaperons and regulate client proteins involved in cell
proliferation and apoptosis [41]. Tubulin can also form
a complex with Na+/K+-ATPase to orchestrate the pump
activity. However, acetylated tubulin can bind to Na+/K+ATPase and blunt its catalytic activity [32]. Moreover,
tubulin acetylation is correlated to cell apoptosis. A
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

number of small molecule inhibitors in inhibiting histone
deacetylase 6 have been reported to induce tubulin
acetylation and to display anti-proliferative and apoptotic
activities [42]. Epi-reevesioside F induced tubulin
acetylation which correlated with the inhibition of Na+/
K+-ATPase activity and could contribute to the antiglioblastoma activity.
Epi-reevesioside F induced cell cycle arrest at S
and G2/M phases in T98 cells and that at G2/M phase
in U87 cells. It has been reported that proscillaridin A,
a cardiac glycoside inhibitor of Na+/K+-ATPase, induced
G2/M arrest in glioblastoma cell lines [43]. Bufotalin, a
cardiac glycoside secreted by a number of toad species,
also induced G2/M arrest through down-regulation of
several cell cycle regulators including aurora A, Cdc25,
cyclin-dependent kinase 1 and cyclin A, and up-regulation
of p53 and p21 in hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells
[4]. After further examination, Epi-reevesioside F neither
modified protein expressions of cell cycle regulators (data
not shown) nor induced DNA damage during the initiation
of cellular stress in glioblastoma cells. It is noteworthy
that several types of cells exposed to hyperosmolality
undergo growth arrest at S and G2/M phases of cell cycle
[24, 25]. A number of proteins and kinases are involved
in hyperosmotic cell cycle delay, including GADD45,
GADD153, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and
2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 mitogen-activated
protein kinase [25, 44]. Epi-reevesioside F resulted in a
significant increase of intracellular Na+ concentrations
and a decrease of cell size indicating the induction of
hyperosmotic stress. It could explain the cell cycle arrest
and inhibition of cell proliferation in glioblastoma cells.
Notably, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-kinase)/Akt
pathway is crucial in determining the cell fate under
hyperosmotic stress. The activation of PI3-kinase/Akt
has been suggested to prevent mild hyperosmolalityinduced apoptotic stress in Madin-Darby canine kidney
cells [45]. On the contrary, the hyperosmolar stress can
down-regulate PI3-kinase activity and induce apoptosis
in several types of cells [46]. The present work showed
that Epi-reevesioside F caused the decrease of Akt
phosphorylation on Ser-473, indicating an inhibition of
Akt activity. The data reveal that inhibition of PI3-kinase/
Akt pathway may confer Epi-reevesioside F-induced antiglioblastoma activity in a hyperosmolar stress.
Several lines of evidence showing that hyperosmotic
stress leads to cytosolic acidification followed by
mitochondrial dysfunction and activation of apoptotic
pathway. During the suicidal program, Ca2+ entry
through Ca2+-permeable cation channels or exchangers
may decrease mitochondrial integrity, activating several
proteinases and inducing cell shrinkage [47]. The data
demonstrated that Epi-reevesioside F induced a rapid and
significant increase of intracellular Na+ concentrations
and cytosolic acidification followed by the loss of
mitochondrial membrane potential which was significantly

rescued by extracellular potassium supplements. However,
Epi-reevesioside F did not modify the intracellular Ca2+
concentrations. The data indicate that the ion transport
and cytosolic acidification, but not Ca2+ mobilization,
contribute to mitochondria-involved apoptotic cell death
in glioblastoma cells. Several anticancer approaches
have been proposed to induce intracellular acidification.
The rationale is based on the consideration that under
conditions of cytosolic acidification, the cells are
susceptible to DNA degradation by acid-activated
deoxyribonuclease (DNase) although Ca2+/Mg2+dependent endonucleases dominate DNA digestion in
several apoptotic conditions [48]. Furthermore, it has
been suggested that DNA digestion in cell apoptosis
frequently is not related to alterations in intracellular Ca2+
levels but correlates with intracellular acidification [49].
A variety of cancer chemotherapeutic drugs have been
discovered to induce apoptosis on the basis of intracellular
acidification and activation of acid-activated DNase II
[49]. These studies reveal that targeting the mechanisms
of intracellular pH regulation can be a potential anticancer
strategy. To this end, Epi-reevesioside F which inhibits
Na+/K+-ATPase, leading to changes in ion transport and
intracellular acidification may be a potential candidate for
further development.
Bcl-2 family proteins including pro-apoptotic (e.g.,
Bax, Bak, Bad and Bid) and anti-apoptotic members (e.g.,
Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1) govern mitochondrial outer
membrane permeability. Many Bcl-2 family proteins
bind themselves and each other to form homodimers
or heterodimers. Increasing lines of evidence suggest
that changes in cytosolic pH may regulate the functions
of Bcl-2 family members [50]. Dimerization of Bcl-2
family proteins can be promoted under lower pH through
a decreased rate of dimer dissociation [51]. Moreover,
mitochondrial proton transporters and proton circuit can
be affected by variations in cytosolic pH [52]. Of note,
apoptosis induced by cytosolic acidification can be either
caspase-dependent or caspase-independent [30, 50]. In this
regard, Epi-reevesioside F induced a significant loss of
mitochondrial membrane potential and a dramatic increase
of cleaved Bak formation and its exposure of N terminus
suggesting a profound increase of Bak activity [33]. In
addition, caspase-dependent apoptosis was activated
to Epi-reevesioside F action. Bak is constitutively
expressed in mitochondrial outer membrane. Bak and
Bax form mitochondrial apoptosis-induced channel and,
furthermore, Bak interacts and enhances the opening of
mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel, making
mitochondrial outer membrane permeable to pro-apoptotic
proteins, such as cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO [53,
54]. It is essential in coordinating apoptosis induced by
various cancer chemotherapeutic drugs in a variety of
cancers, including temozolomide in the treatment of
glioblastoma multiforme [55]. The data suggest that Bak
activation may enhance Epi-reevesioside F-induced antiwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

glioblastoma activity through mitochondrial apoptosis
pathway.
Taken together, the data suggest that Epireevesioside F can potently inhibit Na+/K+-ATPase,
leading to overload of intracellular Na+, changes in ion
transport and cytosolic acidification which in turn result
in Bak activation and a loss of mitochondrial membrane
potential. The PI3-kinase/Akt pathway is inhibited and
caspase-dependent apoptosis is ultimately triggered in Epireevesioside F-treated glioblastoma cells. The data suggest
that Epi-reevesioside F can be a potential candidate for
anti-glioblastoma development.

was used to determine ∆Ψm. Cells were treated with or
without Epi-reevesioside F. Thirty minutes before the
termination of incubation, the cells were incubated with
JC-1 (final concentration of 2 µM) at 37°C for 30 minutes.
The cells were finally harvested and the accumulation
of JC-1 was determined using flow cytometric analysis
(Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA).

Measurement of intracellular Na+ concentrations
After the treatment, the cells were incubated with
CoroNa Green (1 μM) for 45 minutes. The cells were
washed twice and suspended in PBS. The intracellular
Na+ concentrations were determined by flow cytometric
analysis (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA).

Cell proliferation assay by CFSE labeling
CFSE was dissolved in DMSO to constitute a
storage solution of 10 mM and kept at -80oC until use. The
cells were adjusted to a density of 106 cells/ml and were
treated with CFSE at a final concentration of 10 μM. After
incubation at 37oC for 10 minutes, DMEM with 10% FCS
was added. Tubes were placed in ice for 5 minutes and
then washed. After centrifugation, the cells were seeded
in DMEM with 10% FCS for the indicated times at 37 oC
in 5% CO2/95% air. After the treatment, the fluorescence
intensity was determined by flow cytometric analysis
(Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA).

Detection of intracellular acidification
After the treatment, the cells were incubated with
seminaphtharhodafluor-1 (1 μM) for 45 minutes. The
cells were washed twice and suspended in PBS. The
fluorescence emission in channels FL2 and FL3 was
analyzed with a flow cytometer. During the elaboration
of the data, a ratio of the fluorescence emissions and the
mean fluorescence ratio were calculated. Furthermore,
isolated T98 cells were recorded in an open chamber slide
and were analyzed by a confocal laser microscopic system
(Leica TCS SP2).

Flow cytometric assay of PI staining
After the exposure to the indicated agent, cells were
harvested by trypsinization, fixed with 70 % (v/v) alcohol
at 4oC for 30 minutes and washed with PBS. The cells
were centrifuged and resuspended with 0.5 ml PI solution
containing Triton X-100 (0.1%, v/v), RNase (100 μg/ml)
and PI (80 μg/ml). DNA content was analyzed with the
FACScan and CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson,
Mountain View, CA).

Western blotting
After the treatment, the cells were harvested by
trypsinization, centrifuged and lysed in 0.1 ml of lysis
buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1mM
EGTA, 1 % Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 mM
sodium fluoride and 100 μM sodium orthovanadate).
For Western blot analysis, 40 μg proteins were separated
by electrophoresis in a 12% polyacrylamide gel and
transferred to a PVDF membrane. After one hour
incubation at room temperature in PBS/5% non-fat
milk, the membrane was washed with PBS/0.1% Tween
20 for another 1 hour and overnight incubated with the
indicated antibody at 4°C. After three washings with
PBS/0.1% Tween 20, the anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG
(dilute 1:4000) was applied to the membranes for 1 hour
at room temperature. The membranes were washed with
PBS/0.1% Tween 20 for 1 hour and the detection of signal
was performed with an enhanced chemiluminescence
detection kit (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK).

Measurement of intracellular Ca2+ concentrations
Cells were pre-incubated with fluo-3/AM (2.5 μM)
for 30 minutes. The cells were washed twice and incubated
in fresh medium. Vehicle (0.1% DMSO), Epi-reevesioside
F or ouabain was added to the cells for the indicated times.
The intracellular Ca2+ concentrations were determined by
flow cytometric analysis (Becton Dickinson, Mountain
View, CA).

After the treatment, the cells were harvested by
trypsinization, fixed with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde
(pH=7.4) at 4oC for 5 minutes and washed with PBS.
After centrifugation, cells were permeabilized with 0.01%
saponin/PBS and incubated with anti-Bak antibody (N
terminus) or IgG for 1 hour at 4oC. The cells were then
washed and incubated with FITC-labeled anti-mouse
secondary antibody for another 1 hour at 4oC. Cells were
washed and re-suspended in PBS for the flow cytometric
analysis (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA).
