Abstract
Cells dying by necrosis release the high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein, which has immunostimulatory effects. However, little is known about the direct actions of extracellular HMGB1 protein on cancer
cells. Here, we show that recombinant human HMGB1 (rhHMGB1) exerts strong cytotoxic effects on malignant tumor cells. The rhHMGB1-induced cytotoxicity depends on the presence of mitochondria and leads to
fast depletion of mitochondrial DNA, severe damage of the mitochondrial proteome by toxic malondialdehyde adducts, and formation of giant mitochondria. The formation of giant mitochondria is independent of
direct nuclear signaling events, because giant mitochondria are also observed in cytoplasts lacking nuclei.
Further, the reactive oxygen species scavenger N-acetylcysteine as well as c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase blockade inhibited the cytotoxic effect of rhHMGB1. Importantly, glioblastoma cells, but not normal astrocytes,
were highly susceptible to rhHMGB1-induced cell death. Systemic treatment with rhHMGB1 results in significant growth inhibition of xenografted tumors in vivo. In summary, rhHMGB1 induces a distinct form of
cell death in cancer cells, which differs from the known forms of apoptosis, autophagy, and senescence,
possibly representing an important novel mechanism of specialized necrosis. Further, our findings suggest
that rhHMGB1 may offer therapeutic applications in treatment of patients with malignant brain tumors.

Introduction
High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is an architectural
transcription factor present in most eukaryotic cells (1),
but it can also act as a cytokine when released from necrotic cells into the extracellular space (2). HMGB1 exerts
pleiotropic biological effects by binding to several members of the Toll-like family such as receptor for advanced
glycation end products (RAGE) or Toll-like receptor 2
(TLR2) and TLR4 (1), thereby promoting inflammatory processes as shown in a mouse model of sepsis (3). Interestingly, HMGB1 can also function in an antimicrobial
manner. Phosphorylated recombinant HMGB1 and native
HMGB1 extracted from tumor cells inhibit eukaryotic
closed circular DNA replication in vitro (4). Similarly,
recombinant and human adenoid-derived HMGB1 revealed
antimicrobial activity (5, 6).

In addition to the established role of HMGB1 in inflammation, there is growing evidence for its contribution to cancer
(7, 8). Breast cancer patients with a TLR4 single-nucleotide
polymorphism had a worse clinical outcome due to the lack
of immunoadjuvant effects of HMGB1 released from dying
tumor cells (9). Interaction of glioblastoma-derived HMGB1
with TLR2 of dendritic cells was crucial for initiating an effective antitumor immune response in an intracranial glioma
xenograft mouse model (10). Studies in an orthotopic syngeneic intracranial glioma rat model showed that the efficacy of
an immunotherapy with adenoviruses expressing the cytokine Flt3L and thymidine kinase was dependent on circulating HMGB1 (11). In contrast, HMGB1 may also elicit direct
antitumor activity. Endogenous HMGB1 influences the
responsiveness of cancer cells to cisplatin by shielding the
drug-induced DNA adducts from excision repair, thus promoting apoptosis specifically in tumor cells (12, 13).
In this study, we examined the potential of exogenous
HMGB1 to induce cell death in cancer cells in vitro and
in vivo. We describe a recombinant human HMGB1
(rhHMGB1)–dependent novel form of cell death, which is
accompanied by the formation of vacuolated giant mitochondria and a rapid depletion of mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA). Thus, the HMGB1-induced signaling pathway
might be a distinct mechanism of how tumor cell death
evolves in vivo, thereby contributing in the formation
and expansion of nonvital tissue areas classically viewed
as tumor “necrosis.”

Cytotoxicity of rhHMGB1

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Human cancer cell lines were purchased from the American
Type Culture Collection, expanded, and frozen in aliquots
within 4 weeks of purchase. For the experiments described
here, the cells were thawed and cultured for no more than
eight passages. Nonimmortalized human astrocytic cells were
purchased from ScienCell and immediately used for the
experiments described. For detailed information, see Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Animal studies
Six-week-old male athymic CD1 nude mice (n = 8;
Charles River) were injected s.c. with 7.5 × 106 U251MG
cells in 100 μL PBS in the right flank using a 30-gauge
needle. After 3 weeks, treatment of the xenograft tumors
was initiated with 10 μg rhHMGB1 in 500 μL PBS or
PBS only (control group) by daily i.p. injections at the contralateral side for 6 weeks. For detailed information, see
Supplementary Materials and Methods.
One-dimensional/two-dimensional electrophoresis
For large-format two-dimensional (2-D) electrophoresis
and 2-D Western blots, isoelectric focusing was performed
as described previously using dry polyacrylamide gel
strips (IPG, 24 cm) with an immobilized pH gradient
(pH 3–10) and the IPGphor1 Isolectric Focusing System
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For the second dimension, the ETTAN DALTsix electrophoresis system was
used. Western blotting was performed as described previously. For detailed information, see Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Enucleation of cells
U251MG cells (10,000) were seeded in drops of DMEM
(10% FCS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin) on round coverslips
and incubated for 24 hours at 37°C and 5% CO2. The coverslips were put upside down in a 15-mL Falcon tube containing growth medium complemented with 10 μg/mL
cytochalasin B. After 1-hour incubation at 37°C, the 15mL tubes were centrifuged for 1.5 to 3 hours at 37°C with
4,000 rpm. Then, the coverslips were removed and put into
6-cm plates containing growth medium. After a recovering
period of 8 hours, the cytoplasts were treated with
rhHMGB1 for 24 hours. Successful enucleation was confirmed
by immunofluorescence with 1 μg/mL 4′,6-diamidino-2phenylindole.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of reactive
oxygen species and mitochondrial membrane potential
For measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 1.5 ×
106 U251MG cells were seeded in 6-cm plates, treated with
40 nmol/L rhHMGB1 for 24 hours, and incubated with the
fluorescent H2DCF-DA (dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate; 10 μmol/L; Invitrogen) for 1 hour at 37°C. ROS was measured immediately at FL-1. For detailed information, see
Supplementary Materials and Methods.

Intracellular localization of 125I-labeled rhHMGB1
For iodination of rhHMGB1, 100 μg protein was incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes in 50 mmol/L
phosphate (pH 7.0) with 74 MBq carrier-free Na125I (Hartmann Analytic) in the presence of one Iodobead (Pierce).
U251MG cells were seeded on 10-cm culture dishes. After
treatment of cells with 80 nmol/L of 125I-coupled rhHMGB1
for 0, 4, 16, and 24 hours, the cells were detached carefully
by incubation with cell dissociation buffer (30 minutes).
The radioactivity of each subcellular fraction was measured
in a liquid scintillation counter (Packard TriCarb 2900).
For detailed information, see Supplementary Materials
and Methods.
Cellular fractionation
Enrichment of mitochondrial fractions was performed
using the ApoAlert Cell Fractionation kit (Clontech) as described previously (14). Briefly, after several centrifugation
steps, U251MG cells were homogenized with a Dounce tissue
grinder, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 700 × g for
10 minutes at 4°C and the resulting supernatant at 10,000 × g
for 25 minutes at 4°C.
Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy
U251MG cells were plated onto 8-well chamber slides (Nunc)
or grown confluently in 6-cm culture dishes containing round
glass cover plates, permeabilized as described (14), and incubated with monoclonal rabbit fluoro-conjugated anti–COX IV
antibody (1:10, 3E11, Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate; Cell Signaling)
or monoclonal mouse anti–poly-his-tag antibody (1:1,000; R&D
Systems) for 30 minutes at 4°C. For detailed information, see
Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Statistical analysis
All data are means ± SD. The significance of differences
between groups was determined by Student's t test. P values
of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results
rhHMGB1 exerts cytotoxic effects on cancer cells
To study the cellular effects of exogenous rhHMGB1, we
treated human glioblastoma cells with increasing concentrations of rhHMGB1 for several days (Fig. 1A). Treatment with
rhHMGB1 resulted in a strong inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and induction of cell death even at nanomolar concentrations. Cytotoxicity assays revealed that glioblastoma
cells, but not human nonimmortalized astrocytes, were susceptible to rhHMGB1-induced cell death (Fig. 1B). Similarly,
rhHMGB1 induced a strong inhibition of clonogenic cell survival of glioma cells, but not of astrocytes (Supplementary
Fig. S1). Except U251MG glioblastoma cells, the cytotoxic
effect of rhHMGB1 was also observed in other long-term
(T98G and LN18) and primary (NCH89 and NCH82) glioblastoma cell lines. In these cell lines, the following rhHMGB1
concentrations were required for half-maximal cell killing
(72 hours): T98G, 15 nmol/L; LN18, 15 nmol/L; NCH89,

interaction of rhHMGB1 and temozolomide (Supplementary
Fig. S3). Rat recombinant HMGB1 protein, which exhibits
a high homology to human HMGB1 (>98%; ref. 15), showed
similar cytotoxic effects as rhHMGB1 (Supplementary
Fig. S4). Digestion of rhHMGB1 with 100 μg/mL proteinase
K before treatment completely abrogated the cell death
(data not shown). To test the anticancer activity of
rhHMGB1 in vivo, we systemically treated CD1 athymic
nude mice bearing subcutaneous glioma xenograft tumors
with rhHMGB1. After 6 weeks, the rhHMGB1-treated animals showed significantly smaller tumors than the control
group (Fig. 1D).
rhHMGB1-dependent increase in radical oxygen species
leads to c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activation
Next, we examined the intracellular signaling events leading to rhHMGB1-induced cell death. rhHMGB1 treatment resulted in a strong generation of ROS, which was partially
prevented by the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC;
Fig. 2A, left). Cotreatment of the cells with NAC substantially
inhibited rhHMGB1-induced cell death (Fig. 2A, right).
Similarly, both the rhHMGB1-induced increase in ROS and
the rhHMGB1-dependent cell death were significantly inhibited by PEG-superoxide dismutase (SOD) and PEG-catalase
as well as by overexpression of mitochondrially targeted
manganese-SOD (MnSOD) and (to a lesser extent) catalase
(Supplementary Fig. S5). The rhHMGB1-induced ROS generation occurred as early as 6 hours after treatment began.
In contrast, loss of plasma membrane integrity as assessed
by lactate dehydrogenase release was a late event observed
after ∼36 hours of rhHMGB1 treatment (Supplementary
Fig. S6). Moreover, rhHMGB1 caused a continuous and
dose-dependent phosphorylation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase 1/2 (JNK; Fig. 2B, left). The activation of JNK contributes
to rhHMGB1-dependent cytotoxicity because coincubation
with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 not only reduced the
amount of phosphorylated JNK (Supplementary Fig. S7) but
also partially inhibited cell death induced by rhHMGB1 (Fig.
2B, right). The NAC-dependent inhibition of ROS prevented
the activation of JNK after rhHMGB1 treatment (Fig. 2C, left),
indicating that rhHMGB1-induced ROS generation occurs
upstream of JNK activation. To investigate the functional importance of intact mitochondria in rhHMGB1-induced cytotoxicity, we generated cells devoid of intact mtDNA, so-called
pseudo rho zero cells (ρ0 cells; ref. 16). Importantly, ρ0 cells
were almost completely resistant to rhHMGB1-induced
cell death (Fig. 2C, right), whereas the apoptotic cell death
signaling cascade was still intact in these cells (Supplementary Fig. S8). These results suggested that mitochondria
represent a main target for cytotoxic actions of rhHMGB1.
This hypothesis was further confirmed by the observation
that rhHMGB1-induced cell death in U251MG glioma cells
was substantially inhibited by adding uridine to the culture
medium (Fig. 2C, right). Whereas ρ0 cells devoid of intact
mtDNA are pyrimidine auxotrophs (16, 17), normal cells
essentially depend on mitochondrial-derived uridine. Therefore, the uridine-mediated protection from rhHMGB1-induced
cell death indicates that the disturbance of mitochondrial

www.aacrjournals.org

metabolic pathways is essential for the cytotoxic activity
of rhHMGB1.
rhHMGB1 localizes to the mitochondria and induces
the formation of giant mitochondria
Given the mitochondria-dependent effects of rhHMGB1,
we investigated whether rhHMGB1 induces morphologic
changes in mitochondria. Because treatment of glioma cells
with rhHMGB1 resulted in the formation of large vacuolated
organelles as observed by phase-contrast microscopy (data
not shown), we performed electron microscopy of cells treated with rhHMGB1. The ultrastructure of the vacuoles
revealed a double-membrane and rudimentary cristae
(Fig. 3), confirming the mitochondrial nature of the vacuolated organelles. The size of these giant mitochondria increased
in a time- and concentration-dependent manner after incubation with rhHMGB1 (Supplementary Fig. S9). To further
characterize the rhHMGB1-dependent mitochondrial
changes, we performed immunofluorescence studies using
the mitochondrial marker enzyme COX IV. These experiments unambiguously identified the vacuolated organelles
as extremely enlarged spherical mitochondria in 100% of
cells treated with rhHMGB1 (Fig. 4A). In contrast, tumor cells
devoid of intact mtDNA (ρ0 cells) that were highly resistant
to the cytotoxic actions of rhHMGB1 (Fig. 2C, right) did not
form giant mitochondria (Supplementary Fig. S10). Given the
chromatin-binding function of rhHMGB1, we next investigated whether the nuclear localization of rhHMGB1 is required
for the formation of giant mitochondria (e.g., by nucleomitochondrial translocation). Therefore, we generated U251MG
cells devoid of nuclei, the so-called cytoplasts. Treatment of
cytoplasts with rhHMGB1 resulted in the formation of giant
mitochondria to a similar extent and in a similar time frame
compared with nucleus-containing control cells (Fig. 4B),
showing that nuclear events are not required for the generation of giant mitochondria. To address the question of how
exogenous HMGB1 can induce such marked mitochondrial
effects, we investigated the subcellular localization of
rhHMGB1. When U251MG glioma cells were incubated with
125
I-labeled rhHMGB1, a time-dependent increase of radioactivity was observed in the mitochondrial fraction (Fig. 4C),
suggesting that after penetration of the cell membrane, a
substantial amount of rhHMGB1 translocated to the mitochondria. Translocation of rhHMGB1 to the mitochondria
was also confirmed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy after costaining with a mitochondrial marker (Fig. 4D).
The rhHMGB1-induced cellular effects define a distinct
mode of cell death
To further characterize the rhHMGB1-mediated cytotoxicity, we examined whether rhHMGB1-induced cell
death shares the phenotypic characteristics of apoptosis,
autophagy, senescence, or classic necrosis. First, after
rhHMGB1 treatment, the typical morphologic features of
apoptosis, such as membrane blebbing, formation of
apoptotic bodies, or chromatin condensation, were absent.
In addition, activation of caspase-3 or release of cytochrome
c was not observed after rhHMGB1 treatment (Fig. 5A), and

rhHMGB1-induced cell death was not blocked by the caspase
inhibitor zVAD-fmk (Supplementary Fig. S11A). Electron microscopy showed neither autophagosomes characteristic for
autophagic cell death nor disintegration and rupture of the
outer cell membrane indicative of necrotic cell death (Fig. 3).
Moreover, autophagy was excluded by a lack of formation of
LC3-GFP dots (Supplementary Fig. S11B) and by a lack of
LC3I/II conversion (Supplementary Fig. S11C) after incubation with rhHMGB1. The rhHMGB1-induced cell death was
not blocked by the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine or
the necroptosis inhibitor necrostatin (Supplementary Fig.
11A). Next, we examined whether the senescence-associated

DNA double-strand break repair enzyme H2A.X (18) was
activated by rhHMGB1. However, H2A.X phosphorylation
was not observed on rhHMGB1 treatment (Fig. 5B). Senescence was also excluded by analyzing β-galactosidase
activity after treatment with rhHMGB1 (Supplementary
Fig. S11D). Similarly, the necrosis-associated BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) was not upregulated after treatment of cells with rhHMGB1 (Fig. 5B).
Thus, the rhHMGB1-mediated cell death lacks the typical
features of apoptosis, autophagy, or classic necrosis.

mitochondria does not only occur in cultured tumor cells

but also in vivo, we examined the tumor tissue of xenografted nude mice treated systemically with rhHMGB1
(Fig. 1D). After immunohistochemical staining of COX IV,
numerous giant mitochondria were observed in the xenografted tumor cells of rhHMGB1-treated animals (42% of
cells; Fig. 5C, arrows). However, giant mitochondria were
to a lesser extent also visible in perinecrotic areas in untreated tumors (16% of perinecrotic cells; Fig. 5C, asterisk).
Therefore, we hypothesized that giant mitochondria–

associated cell death might represent a mechanism commonly occurring in the setting of tumor necrosis. To test
this hypothesis, we examined a panel of 25 human malignant tumors of diverse tissue origin containing necrotic
areas by COX IV immunohistochemistry to detect giant
mitochondria. In fact, in the majority of cases (80%),
tumor cells with giant mitochondria surrounding nonvital
tissue areas were observed, especially in glioblastomas and
squamous cell carcinomas (Fig. 5D).

blot analysis of the mitochondrial proteome revealed a substantial increase in covalently bound malondialdehyde in the
alkaline range after treatment with rhHMGB1 (Fig. 6C). Similarly, rhHMGB1 induced the formation of hydroxynonenal
(19) adducts (Supplementary Fig. S12A). HMGB1 also altered
the ratio of glutathione (GSH) to glutathione disulfide (GSSG)
shown by a significant increase in GSSG and a decrease in
GSH after 48 hours of rhHMGB1 treatment (Supplementary

induces lipid peroxidation, severe oxidative stress, and inhibition of mtDNA replication.

Discussion
In this study, we describe that rhHMGB1 protein induces
a novel form of cell death that is characterized by the formation of giant mitochondria and a severe damage to
mtDNA and proteins. It has been described that both endogenous HMGB1 that is released from dying tumor cells and

8566

recombinant HMGB1 act as immune adjuvants, enabling
dendritic cells and cytotoxic T cells to attack specifically tumor cells (7, 10). Moreover, HMGB1 signaling through TLR2
and TLR4 is crucial for an effective immune response mediating tumor regression in humans (9) and in rodents (10, 11).
However, the giant mitochondria–associated rhHMGB1induced cell death we describe is independent of TLR2,
TLR4, or RAGE signaling, because the TLR4, TLR2, and
RAGE agonists lipopolysaccharide (LPS), PAM3CSK4, and
AGE did not induce formation of giant mitochondria or cell
death in glioma cells (Supplementary Fig. S13). Moreover,
overexpression of the receptors TLR2, TLR4, RAGE, or their
intracellular transducers MyD88 and TRIF, or the small interfering RNA–mediated downregulation of TLR4 or RAGE did
not alter the susceptibility of glioma cells to the rhHMGB1induced cell death (Supplementary Fig. S14; data not shown).
Recently, it was shown that endogenous HMGB1 can
translocate from the nucleus to the mitochondria, resulting
in reorganization of the mitochondria in endothelial cells

Cytotoxicity of rhHMGB1

(20). In our study, we show that rhHMGB1 enters the mitochondria, which is followed by the formation of giant mitochondria. However, the mechanisms that enable HMGB1 to
pass the cell membrane and the mitochondrial membranes
still have to be clarified. Interestingly, HMGB1 has been used
to potentiate the transfection of cells with compacted DNA,
yielding greater transfection rates compared with conventional techniques (21). This might be due to the polybasic penetratin-like domain of HMGB1, common to proteins such as
Antennapedia, lactoferrin, and the HIV protein Tat, which
can transport DNA or RNA across cell and organelle membranes (1). In this context, it is interesting that the uptake of
rhHMGB1 in glioma cells was not inhibited by the endocytosis
inhibitor brefeldin A and that several endocytosis inhibitors
did not alter the extent of HMGB1-induced cell death (Supplementary Fig. S15), suggesting that endocytosis does not play
an essential role for the internalization of rhHMGB1.
Our results suggest that rhHMGB1 is the first known
mammalian protein that specifically induces the generation
of giant mitochondria. The giant mitochondria observed in
our study are morphologically similar to megamitochondria, which can be induced by several chemical compounds, including ethanol, chloramphenicol, hydrazine,
and ethidium bromide (22). However, in the glioblastoma
cell model we used, the giant mitochondria–associated cell
death was not observed after treatment with compounds
that are reportedly known to induce megamitochondria
and depletion of mtDNA in other cell systems (22), such
as high doses of ethidium bromide or ethanol (data not
shown). Moreover, we show that even very low concentrations of rhHMGB1 are capable of inducing giant mitochondria. Once translocated to mitochondria, rhHMGB1 leads
to a rapid depletion of mtDNA. A similarly rapid but reversible and less effective depletion of mtDNA is described
for ethanol in the liver cells of an alcoholic binge mouse
model (23). Importantly, the rhHMGB1-dependent effects
on mitochondria are absent in pseudo ρ0 cells harboring
mutated and intercalated mtDNA instead of intact, wildtype mtDNA. In this context, it is of interest that the human HMGB1 protein can inhibit closed circular plasmid
replication in vitro (24) and that the yeast homologue of
HMGB1, the mitochondrial HM protein, is required for
the maintenance and expression of the yeast mitochondrial
genome. In contrast, a deficiency of HM under certain circumstances leads to loss of mtDNA, which can be prevented by overexpression of NHP6A, the yeast nuclear
variant of HM (25, 26). Therefore, HMGB1 or its yeast
homologues are important regulatory proteins that can
maintain or inhibit the expression of the mitochondrial
genome. We postulate that the interaction of rhHMGB1
with mtDNA mediates the deleterious effects of rhHMGB1
on the mitochondrial genome and proteome as well as the
giant mitochondria–associated cell death.
What are the downstream effectors of rhHMGB1-induced
cell death? Our data indicate an important role of ROS,
which rapidly rise after treatment of cells with rhHMGB1,
whereas the loss of plasma membrane integrity is a rather
late event in rhHMGB1-induced cytotoxicity. Both the ROS

increase and cell death on rhHMGB1 treatment were inhibited by NAC as well as by specific ROS scavengers such as
PEG-catalase and PEG-SOD. Similarly, a ROS increase and
higher intramitochondrial concentrations of its toxic lipid
peroxidation product malondialdehyde were measured during the formation of megamitochondria in hepatocytes
from rats fed with the megamitochondria-inducing compound hydrazine (22, 27), which resulted in the induction
of apoptosis in this cell model (28). Accordingly, our experiments revealed high concentrations of intramitochondrial
toxic malondialdehyde protein adducts after treatment with
rhHMGB1, resulting in a severe damage of the mitochondrial proteome. The mitochondria seem to be the main
mediators of the rhHMGB1-induced cell death, because nuclear signaling events are not required for giant mitochondria formation as shown in glioma cells devoid of nuclei.
With respect to both morphology and signal transduction
events, the rhHMGB1-induced cell death is different from
apoptosis, autophagocytotic cell death, and senescence. It is
also different from classic necrosis, which is characterized
by cytoplasmic swelling, rupture of the plasma membrane,
and mild swelling (but not fusion) of cytoplasmic organelles
(29). Moreover, the giant mitochondria–associated cell death
observed in our study clearly differs from the recently described “necroptosis,” a form of programmed necrosis that
depends on the kinase RIP1 (30). Giant mitochondria have
thus far not been reported to be associated with necroptosis,
and necrostatin-1 had no effect on rhHMGB1-induced cell
death (Supplementary Fig. S11A), which excludes an essential
role for the RIP1 kinase activity. Because cells with giant
mitochondria are present at perinecrotic areas in human
tumor tissue and because the HMGB1 protein is released
during necrosis, the HMGB1-induced, giant mitochondria–
associated cell death might represent an important novel
mechanism of specialized necrosis.
The molecular basis of giant mitochondria formation is
still not understood. Similarly, further studies are needed
to elucidate why exogenous HMGB1 protein is much more
effective in inducing giant mitochondria than the endogenously expressed HMGB1 protein. Although giant
mitochondria formation is observed on transfection and
overexpression of hHMGB1 (Supplementary Fig. S6), the
extent of giant mitochondria generation is larger after exogenous treatment with HMGB1. Thus, we hypothesize
that exogenous HMGB1 undergoes a modification when
it passes the cell membrane, for example, as described
for serine-phosphorylated HMGB1 that is directed toward
secretion (31). Tyrosine residue modification seems not
to play a crucial role, as the covalent binding of 125I to
tyrosine phosphorylation sites did not interfere with
rhHMGB1-induced giant mitochondria formation and cell
death (data not shown).
Finally, the application of rhHMGB1 might be a promising new approach in the therapy of patients with malignant tumors. Because glioblastoma cells, but not normal
astrocytic cell cultures, were highly susceptible to
rhHMGB1-induced cell death, the rhHMGB1-mediated
mitochondrial effects might be tumor specific. However,

the potential toxicity of rhHMGB1 will need to be investigated thoroughly, because rHMGB1 can mediate endotoxemia in mice. Wang and colleagues showed that in
mice between 20 and 50 μg, HMGB1 is released into
the murine circulation after stimulation with LPS, whereas in our xenograft mouse model 10 μg of rhHMGB1 were
administered i.p. (3). Future studies will have to examine
in detail the possibilities and limitations of a rhHMGB1based experimental therapy.
