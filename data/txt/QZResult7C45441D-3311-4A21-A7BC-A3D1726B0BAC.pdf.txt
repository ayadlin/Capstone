Can Be Overcome by Increased NOXA Expression in
Leukemic B cells

Abstract
ABT-737 is a small molecule Bcl-2 homology (BH)-3 domain mimetic that binds to the Bcl-2 family proteins Bcl-2
and Bcl-xL and is currently under investigation in the clinic. In this study, we investigated potential mechanisms of
resistance to ABT-737 in leukemia cell lines. Compared with parental cells, cells that have developed acquired
resistance to ABT-737 showed increased expression of Mcl-1 in addition to posttranslational modiﬁcations that
facilitated both Mcl-1 stabilization and its interaction with the BH3-only protein Bim. To sensitize resistant cells,
Mcl-1 was targeted by two pan–Bcl-2 family inhibitors, obatoclax and gossypol. Although gossypol was effective
only in resistant cells, obatoclax induced cell death in both parental and ABT-737–resistant cells. NOXA levels were
increased substantially by treatment with gossypol and its expression was critical for the gossypol response.
Mechanistically, the newly generated NOXA interacted with Mcl-1 and displaced Bim from the Mcl-1/Bim complex,
freeing Bim to trigger the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Together, our ﬁndings indicate that NOXA and Mcl-1
are critical determinants for gossypol-mediated cell death in ABT-737–resistant cells. These data therefore reveal
novel insight into mechanisms of acquired resistance to ABT-737. Cancer Res; 72(12); 3069–79. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
The interplay between Bcl-2 family members is essential for
controlling the mitochondrial cell death pathway and thereby
the survival of most cells, including those of hematopoietic
origin. On the basis of their Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains, the
Bcl-2 proteins have been grouped in 3 classes: antiapoptotic
(containing the BH1-BH4 domains), proapoptotic, containing
the BH1-BH3 domains, and those with the BH3 domain-only (1,
2). The members of this group regulate mitochondrial outer
membrane permeabilization (MOMP), monitoring release of
cytochrome c and activating downstream effector caspases (3).
The imbalance in expression of these partners has been
implicated in development of various tumor types and resistance to chemotherapeutic regimens (1). This often results
from high-level expression of antiapoptotic members, such as
Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, Bcl-w, and Bﬂ-1 that prevent cell death by

sequestering BH3-only proteins, such as Bim, PUMA, and
NOXA, and regulate activation of the proapoptotic proteins
Bax and Bak. In most of these cases, upregulation and binding
of signiﬁcant amounts of antiapoptotic proteins to activator
proteins keeps these cells alive (1, 2, 4, 5).
ABT-737 is a small molecule inhibitor that is effective against
certain Bcl-2 family members. It has a strong afﬁnity for Bcl-2,
Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w that are bound to Bim (6) by releasing Bim
from antiapoptotic Bcl-2 partners, thereby initiating MOMP.
The oral derivative of ABT-737, navitoclax (ABT-263) is currently under investigation in several clinical trials in lymphoid
malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL),
and tumors, such as small cell lung cancer (7–10). Importantly,
ABT-737–mediated cell death is Bax/Bak dependent as Bax/
Bak double knockout mouse ﬁbroblasts are resistant to this
treatment (11). However, it is expected that even for the most
effective chemotherapeutics, acquired resistance remains a
serious clinical problem; hence compounds that overcome
drug resistance are of special interest in cancer therapy
(7, 12–15). Studies with solution competition assays have
shown that ABT-737 has very weak afﬁnity for Mcl-1 (16).
Various in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that sensitivity
to ABT-737 is decreased in cells expressing elevated levels of
Mcl-1 (5). Moreover, cells initially sensitive to ABT-737 become
resistant by upregulating Mcl-1 levels (7).
To investigate the probable mechanisms of resistance to
ABT-737, resistant cell lines were generated from pre–B tumor
cells that developed increased levels of Mcl-1 protein that was
also posttranslationally modiﬁed. These Mcl-1–dependent
ABT-737–resistant cells (ABT-R) were exquisitely sensitive to
the pan–Bcl-2 inhibitor gossypol, but not obatoclax.

Knockdown of Mcl-1 or NOXA overcame gossypol sensitivity
of ABT-R cells. Gossypol-induced, NOXA-dependent cell death
led to release of Bim from Mcl-1 in ABT-R cells. These studies
reveal novel insights into regulation and role of Mcl-1 in
response to ABT-737 and provide mechanistic approaches for
overcoming the acquired resistance to ABT-737 in leukemic
cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
Human B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines Nalm6 and Reh were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. These pre-B cells express CD19 and CD127 surface
markers with rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chains. Cells
were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10%
FBS (Atlanta Biologicals), L-glutamine, Antibiotic–Antimycotic
(Invitrogen). ABT-R cells were cultured in 5% FBS. Cell lines
were routinely veriﬁed for growth rates, morphologic characteristics, and response to stimuli using Trypan blue exclusion
or Annexin V/propidium iodide staining. Cell lines were periodically tested to be Mycoplasma free and their passage
number did not exceed 20. ABT-737 was provided by Abbott
Laboratories. Gossypol, actinomycin D, and cycloheximide
were from Sigma-Aldrich and obatoclax from Selleck
Chemicals.
Generation of ABT-737–resistant cell lines
Nalm-6 and Reh cells were cultured in increasing concentrations of ABT-737 administered intermittently, with the drug
being washed off to allow cells to recover. Gradually, the ABT737 concentration was increased until cells remained viable
when ABT-737 concentrations double to that of their IC50 value
was administered continuously. Cells were treated with verapamil (Sigma-Aldrich) to exclude the possibility of acquiring
resistance due to increase in expression of drug efﬂux pumps
(7, 17). The ABT-R cells were routinely monitored for resistance
to ABT-737; they were cultured without drug for 72 hours
before carrying out experiments.
Flow cytometry
Cell death was measured by phosphatidylserine externalization (5), by staining with ﬂuorescein-conjugated Annexin V
(BD Biosciences) and propidium iodide, and analyzed on a BD
FACS Calibur ﬂow cytometer. The raw data obtained was
analyzed by CellQuest Version 5.2.1 software. The results were
normalized to survival of control cells that have been treated
with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or ethanol.
Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation
Protein lysates were prepared with 1% NP-40 lysis buffer (20
mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 150 mmol/L NaCl; 1 mmol/L EDTA;
1% NP-40) containing protease inhibitors (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors cocktail 2 and 3 (Sigma). The cells were lysed
for 30 to 45 minutes at 4 C. Fifty to 60 mg of protein was
resolved on 10% to 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotting was carried out with
primary antibodies. For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed

3070

with CHAPS buffer (20 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 150 mmol/L
NaCl; 1 mmol/L EDTA; 2% CHAPS; Calbiochem) containing
protease and phosphates inhibitors for 1 hour. Protein lysates
were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 C followed by 1 hour of incubation of protein A agarose beads
(eBioscience; Calbiochem) at 4 C. Immunoprecipitates were
washed 3 times with CHAPS and eluted with loading buffer.
The coimmunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDSPAGE. For Bax activation, cells were lysed with 1% CHAPS lysis
buffer for 1 hour at 4 C and active Bax was immunoprecipitated with 6A7 (BD Biosciences) and probed with N20 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. Primary antibodies used were
for Mcl-1, Bim (BD-Biosciences), NOXA (Enzo Life Sciences),
Bcl-2, Bcl-xL (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PUMA (ProSci Corporation), USP-9X (Abnova), PARP1 (Cell Signaling), Mcl-1
(Ser-64; ref. 18; provided by Dr. Gregory J. Gores, Mayo Clinic,
Rochester, MN), Mcl-1 (Thr-163) (Cell Signaling), phospho-Erk
(Cell Signaling), and b-actin (Sigma).
RNA isolation and real-time quantitative PCR
RNA isolated from parental and ABT-R cells after ABT-737
treatment (500–1,000 nmol/L) for 4 to 24 hours was examined
by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), using
primers for Mcl-1 and NOXA, and normalized for b-actin as
described (5). Similar experiments were carried out with ABTR cells followed by gossypol (10 mmol/L) at 12 hours. The halflife of Mcl-1 mRNA was determined following actinomycin D
treatment and qRT-PCR analysis.
Genetic manipulation of Mcl-1 and NOXA
NOXA knockdown was achieved in ABT-R Nalm-6 and Reh
cells by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) delivered by lentivirus
transduction (5). Single cell clones with stable expression of
shNOXA (Santa Cruz; sc-37305-V), shMcl-1 (Sigma-Aldrich:
NM_021960.3-3125s1c1, NM_021960.3-1001s1c1) and scrambled shRNA (control; sc-108080) were selected with puromycin
(Sigma-Aldrich). NOXA shRNA lentiviral particles were
obtained as a pool of concentrated, transduction-ready viral
particles containing 3 target-speciﬁc constructs that encode 19
to 25 nt (plus hairpin). Mcl-1 shRNA lentiviral particles were
prepared according to manufacturer's protocol.
Statistical analysis
Statistical comparisons between groups were conducted by
2-way ANOVA using Prism software. SD was calculated from
experiments conducted in triplicates and indicated as error
bars. All experiments were repeated 3 times independently.

Results
Acquired resistance of B-cells to ABT-737 after
prolonged exposure
ABT-737 is a BH3-mimetic that binds only to certain Bcl-2
family proteins, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w, but not Mcl-1.
In our previous studies, we have shown that patients with
increased Mcl-1 levels do not respond to ABT-737 and thereby
become resistant to this drug (5). Hence, to investigate the
mechanism responsible for resistance, we generated ABT-737–

resistant (ABT-R) cell lines from initially sensitive pre–B Nalm6 and Reh cells. These cell lines were selected for their
sensitivity to ABT-737, with IC50 values of approximately
1,000 and 500 nm, respectively. The Nalm-6 ABT-R and Reh
ABT-R cells generated could tolerate continuous exposure to
ABT-737 at a concentration double to that of their IC50 value
(Fig. 1A). It has been known that ABT-737 triggers Bax/Bakmediated apoptosis (11). ABT-737 treatment led to Bax activation, as indicated by 6A7 antibody reactivity in Nalm-6 and
Reh cells, but not in their resistant derivatives (Fig. 1B). These

results are in support of how resistant cells could evade Baxmediated apoptosis caused by ABT-737. Further examination
of Bcl-2 family proteins by immunoblotting in parental and
ABT-R cells indicated increased Mcl-1 levels in ABT-R cells
(Fig. 1C). Bﬂ-1 levels were below our detection limit. We could
also observe decreased Bcl-2 and increased Bim levels in Reh
ABT-R cells, which were comparable with those found in Nalm6 ABT-R cells. PUMA and NOXA expression was not markedly
altered (Fig. 1C). Mcl-1 protein levels increased in parental but
not in ABT-R cells following acute ABT-737 treatment (Fig. 1D).

Figure 2. Mcl-1 levels are regulated
by protein stabilization. A, Mcl-1
protein stability was determined
following 10 mg/mL cycloheximide
treatment (left). B, Nalm-6 and
Nalm-6 ABT-R cells were
pretreated with ABT-737 (500
nmol/L) for 3 hours before
exposure to cycloheximide to
determine Mcl-1 protein stability
(left). C, Mcl-1 protein half-life was
determined in Reh and Reh ABT-R
cells following cycloheximide
treatment (left). Data in A–C were
quantiﬁed by ImageJ software and
the relative intensity of each lane
was calculated with respect to the
sample at 0 hour. Results of a
representative experiment (n ¼ 3)
are shown.

In addition, there was no further change of Mcl-1 levels in ABTR cells following 18 hours of ABT-737 exposure (Supplementary
Fig. S1C). Parental cells were sensitive to ABT-737 and within 3
hours, they were committed to cell death, as indicated by
cleavage of PARP1. Increased Mcl-1 levels were attributed to
increased deubiquitination as a result of increased levels of the
USP9X deubiquitinating enzyme (19); however, USP9X levels
(Fig. 1D) and its association with Mcl-1 (data not shown) did
not change in ABT-R cells. Our results showed that ABT-737–
resistant cells could evade Bax-mediated cell death and develop resistance by elevating Mcl-1 levels.
ABT-737 resistance is associated with increased Mcl-1
protein stability
Previous studies of acquired ABT-737 resistance reported
that increased expression levels of Mcl-1 in ABT-R cells are a
result of increased mRNA levels (7). However, there was no
difference in constitutive Mcl-1 and NOXA mRNA levels in
resistant compared with parental Nalm-6 and Reh cells, as
determined by qRT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Similar
results were found for Bﬂ-1 (data not shown). Most importantly, there was no change in Mcl-1 mRNA levels following
chronic ABT-737 treatment in Nalm-6 (1 mmol/L) and Reh (500
nmol/L) parental and ABT-R cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B).

These results indicated that Mcl-1 was not transcriptionally
upregulated; however, this does not preclude the possibility of
a reduced turnover of the Mcl-1 transcript in ABT-737–resistant cells. ABT-R Nalm-6 and Reh cells examined up to 2 hours
following treatment with actinomycin D, a known transcriptional inhibitor, indicated that the half-life of Mcl-1 mRNA was
not altered (data not shown). Because the Mcl-1 protein has a
very short half-life, Mcl-1 protein stability was further evaluated. Immunoblotting following 30 to 90 minutes of cycloheximide treatment revealed that the half-life of Mcl-1 protein was
increased considerably, to 60 to 90 minutes in ABT-R compared with 15 to 20 minutes in parental cells (Fig. 2A–C). These
results indicated that increased Mcl-1 levels of ABT-R cells
were due to its stabilization at the protein and not at mRNA
level.
Increased Mcl-1 levels sequester Bim following its
displacement from Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL complexes in ABT-R
cells
It has been reported that increased Mcl-1 levels in ABT-R
cells associate with Bim after its competitive dissociation from
Bcl-2/Bcl-xL complexes by ABT-737. Importantly, displacement of Bim from Bcl-2/Bcl-xL complexes by ABT-737 in
parental, sensitive cells was shown to be a critical event for

Phospho-Mcl-1 and NOXA Determine the Gossypol Response

committing cells to death (7). Indeed, our coimmunoprecipitation analyses indicated that association of Mcl-1 with Bim
in ABT-R cells was more pronounced compared with those
in parental cells. On the other hand, there was more Bim
present that was not bound to Mcl-1 in parental cells, instead
was found in the supernatant following immunodepletion of
Mcl-1 (Fig. 3A, right). These results were conﬁrmed by reciprocal immunoprecipitation–immunoblot analyses with Mcl-1
and Bim, respectively (Fig. 3A, left).
We next investigated the interaction of Bim with Bcl-2/BclxL in parental and ABT-R Nalm-6 cells. There was less association of Bim with Bcl-2/Bcl-xL in ABT-R compared with
parental Nalm-6 cells, which was in contrast to binding of Bim
to Mcl-1 (Fig. 3A, left). Taken altogether, these data suggested
that Bim was dissociated from Bcl-2/Bcl-xL complexes by
competitive displacement by ABT-737. Moreover, this displaced Bim was bound to Mcl-1 in resistant but not in parental
cells, even when ABT-737 was absent. In contrast, in parental
cells, even though Mcl-1 levels were increased following acute
ABT-737 treatment, Mcl-1 could not bind to Bim (Fig. 3A and
B). Similar observations were made in Reh ABT-R cells (data
not shown).
We next explored the mechanism responsible for the differences in the ability of Mcl-1 to bind Bim in ABT-R compared
with parental cells. It has been shown that Mcl-1 Ser-64
phosphorylation is associated with enhanced binding to proapoptotic proteins, such as Bim, NOXA, and Bak (18). Interestingly, Mcl-1 was phosphorylated on Ser-64 in ABT-R Reh and
Nalm-6, but not in parental cells (Fig. 3C). In contrast, although
Mcl-1 levels increased, nevertheless Mcl-1 Ser-64 phosphorylation was not detected in Nalm-6 following 1 to 2 hours of
acute treatment with ABT-737 (Fig. 3C, left). These ﬁndings
suggested that Mcl-1, the levels of which increased following
ABT-737 treatment in parental cells, failed to associate with
Bim due to lack of Ser-64 Mcl-1 phosphorylation. It has been
reported that Mcl-1 phosphorylation also regulates Mcl-1
protein stability, with Thr-163 Mcl-1 phosphorylation by extracellular signal–regulated kinases (Erk) extending its half-life
(20). Indeed, Mcl-1 was phosphorylated on Thr-163 in ABT-R
Nalm-6 and Reh, but not in parental cells (Fig. 3D, left). Erk was
also activated, as indicated by p-Erk expression in ABT-R but
not the parental cells (Fig. 3D, right). These results indicated
that phosphorylation of Mcl-1 at speciﬁc residues has developed during acquired resistance to ABT-737 treatment. These
Mcl-1 posttranslational modiﬁcations facilitate its interaction
with Bim, leading to increased Mcl-1 protein stability in ABT-R
cells, as previously suggested (21, 22).
Gossypol sensitizes ABT-737–resistant cells by
upregulating NOXA
To overcome Mcl-1–dependent acquired resistance, parental and resistant cells were treated with increasing concentrations of gossypol. Annexin V ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)–propidium iodide staining (Supplementary Fig. S2A)
and trypan blue exclusion (Fig. 4A) indicated that ABT-R cells
were exquisitely sensitive to gossypol treatment compared
with parental cells. In addition, cyclin E cleavage, another
marker of apoptosis (23, 24), was generated in ABT-R cells

www.aacrjournals.org

(data not shown). Time course experiments with gossypol
showed maximum cell death at 24 hours. To study the mechanism of its action and avoid consequences of cell death, the
18-hour time point and a 10 mmol/L of gossypol dose were
chosen as the minimum concentration at which ABT-R but not
parental cells were most sensitive (all other experiments used
gossypol at 10 mmol/L for 18 hours, unless otherwise stated).
Mcl-1 protein stability was not altered substantially following
gossypol treatment in ABT-R cells (data not shown). The levels
of antiapoptotic and proapoptotic proteins were next examined in ABT-R Nalm-6 (left) and Reh cells (right) following a 6to 18-hour exposure to gossypol (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, a low
molecular weight Mcl-1 species was present, most likely an
alternative splice variant of Mcl-1 (Mcl-1s), which has been
reported to function as a proapoptotic molecule (25). The
expression of NOXA increased greatly in a time-dependent
manner (Fig. 4B). Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 levels were downregulated
following treatment in Reh ABT-R cells (Fig. 4B, right); however, PUMA levels did not change signiﬁcantly (data not
shown). There was a modest increase in Mcl-1 levels in
Nalm-6 cells following gossypol treatment, and those of NOXA
also increased less compared with ABT-R cells (Supplementary
Fig. S2B). When NOXA and Mcl-1 mRNA levels were examined
at 12 hours following gossypol treatment, there was a 5- to 6fold increase of Mcl-1 mRNA and a robust 20- to 25-fold
induction of NOXA levels in ABT-R cells (Fig. 4C). These
ﬁndings indicated that upregulation of Mcl-1 and NOXA
following gossypol treatment was at mRNA level.
It has been reported that obatoclax (GX15-070), similar to
gossypol, targets Mcl-1 (26) and is predicted to overcome Mcl1–dependent ABT-737 resistance (27). Indeed, Nalm-6 ABT-R
cells were sensitive to obatoclax; however, Nalm-6 cells were
equally sensitive (IC50: 10 mmol/L). Reh parental cells (IC50: 5
mmol/L) were also more sensitive to obatoclax compared with
ABT-R cells, as measured by trypan blue exclusion (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Mcl-1 protein levels were downregulated
following obatoclax treatment. NOXA levels also increased,
however these changes did not correlate with cell death
(Supplementary Fig. S3B). Hence, gossypol was used for further
studies, as it selectively sensitizes ABT-R cells.
NOXA expression mediates gossypol-induced cell death
To determine whether NOXA induction and cell death are a
consequence of caspase activation, ABT-R Nalm-6 and Reh
cells were treated with a pan-caspase inhibitor before gossypol
treatment. zVAD-fmk addition prevented caspase activation,
but not NOXA induction and generation of Mcl-1(s; Fig. 5A). To
directly show a critical role for NOXA for the gossypol response,
NOXA was depleted by shRNA in ABT-R Nalm-6 and Reh cells,
under conditions in which Mcl-1 and Bim levels were unaltered. Remarkably, NOXA knockdown (Fig. 5C) prevented
signiﬁcantly gossypol-induced cell death of ABT-R Nalm-6
(P ¼ 0.003) and Reh cells (P ¼ 0.008; Fig. 5B), thus showing
the critical role played by NOXA in the cytotoxic gossypol
response. In addition, shRNA-mediated Mcl-1 knockdown in
ABT-R cells (2 independent clones) restored resistance to
gossypol treatment as measured by trypan blue exclusion
(Nalm-6 ABT-R, P ¼ 0.001; Reh ABT-R, P ¼ 0.007;

Mcl-1–dependent ABT-R cells.
Association of NOXA with Mcl-1 leads to release of Bim
following gossypol treatment
Next, to address the mechanism of sensitization by gossypol,
the Mcl-1/Bim association was examined. Bim immunoprecipitation revealed that Mcl-1 was no longer associated with
Bim in Nalm-6 ABT-R cells following gossypol treatment,
indicating that the Bim/Mcl-1 complex was disrupted (Fig.
6A, left). In contrast, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were still bound to Bim in
these Nalm-6 and Reh ABT-R cells (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
Moreover, Mcl-1 pull-down revealed that NOXA interaction
with Mcl-1 facilitated Bim release from the Mcl-1/Bim complex
in ABT-R cells (Fig. 6B). The released Bim, present in the
supernatant (Supplementary Fig. S2E), most likely initiated
gossypol-induced mitochondrial cell death. The Bim/Mcl-1
complex was also disrupted by NOXA in parental cells, but to
a lesser extent, and with a slower kinetics compared with ABT-

R cells (Fig. 6A). To determine the direct effect of NOXA on the
Mcl-1/Bim association after gossypol treatment, NOXA levels
were downregulated by shRNA. Interestingly, shRNA-mediated
NOXA knockdown not only prevented cell death but also the
release of Bim from Mcl-1 and Mcl-1(s) genesis in ABT-R Nalm6 and Reh cells following gossypol treatment (Fig. 5B, 6C).
These results indicated that the association of NOXA with
Mcl-1 in ABT-R cells following gossypol treatment led to
release of Bim that was critical for inducing mitochondrial
cell death.

Discussion
Acquired resistance is a concern for chemotherapeutic
treatments used for lymphoma, CLL, and other malignancies.
Although there have been basic advances in understanding the
mechanisms for this resistance, few efforts have been made to
study the contribution of posttranslational regulation of proteins that leads to such resistance. The focus of our current
studies was to understand the mechanism responsible for
acquired ABT-737 resistance in leukemic cells and how to

overcome it selectively. Nuclear magnetic resonance studies
have shown that ABT-737 binds to Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, and Bcl-w at
sub-nmol/L concentrations, but not to Mcl-1. Hence, Mcl-1
levels can determine ABT-737 sensitivity (7). Moreover, inherent increased levels of these proteins can be a frequent cause of
resistance. Various drugs, such as ﬂavopiridol, R-roscovitine
(Seliciclib), and PHA 767491 that downregulate Mcl-1 at mRNA
level are being tested for sensitizing such tumor cells (7, 28).
Recently, sorafenib (BAY43-9006; Nexavar) was shown to
induce apoptosis by downregulation of Mcl-1 at translational
rather than posttranslational level (29–32). However, due to
lack of in vivo studies, except for ABT-737 and gossypol, most of
the drugs acting as BH3 mimetic or Bcl-2 antagonists in clinical
trials may have potential toxicities (12).
This study has examined the molecular mechanism for acute
versus chronic response to ABT-737 in leukemic cells. Recent
studies and our previous report indicate that increased levels of

Mcl-1 accumulate in ABT-R cells, with Mcl-1 being bound to
Bim signiﬁcantly more in resistant than parental cells (5, 7). As
in our leukemic model of ABT-737 resistance, Mcl-1 was not
upregulated at transcriptional level, which led us to explore its
posttranslational regulation. Previous studies have shown that
posttranslational modiﬁcations, such as phosphorylation of
Mcl-1 at speciﬁc residues, are important for its binding to BH3only proteins and its stability (18, 33). Here, we have shown
that, in ABT-R cells, phosphorylation of Mcl-1 at Ser-64 facilitates association of Bim with Mcl-1. Ser-64 Mcl-1 is not
detected in parental cells, not even following acute treatment
with ABT-737 and it is, rather, acquired during the course of
resistance. Moreover, Mcl-1 was also phosphorylated on Thr163 in ABT-737–resistant cells through Erk activation. Because
Erk pathway was activated, we next studied its role on posttranslational regulation that could impact on Mcl-1 turnover. It
has been shown that Erk phosphorylates Thr-163 on Mcl-1

Phospho-Mcl-1 and NOXA Determine the Gossypol Response

Figure 6. Interaction of NOXA with Mcl-1 triggers the release of Bim from Mcl-1 following gossypol treatment. A, Bim was immunoprecipitated from gossypoltreated cells followed by immunoblotting to determine Mcl-1 association (left). Immunoprecipitation for Mcl-1 was followed by immunoblotting for NOXA
(right). B, association of NOXA and Bim with Mcl-1 was determined by immunoprecipitation–immunoblot analysis in gossypol-treated cells. C, Mcl-1
immunoprecipitates from cells following NOXA knockdown and gossypol treatment were analyzed by immunoblotting for NOXA, Bim, and Mcl-1. Data shown
are representative of 3 independent experiments. D, model for ABT-737 resistance. ABT-737 does not target Mcl-1, which confers resistance by sequestering
Bim displaced from Bcl-2. The Mcl-1/Bim association was enhanced by phosphorylation of Mcl-1, thereby preventing Bax activation. E, model for overcoming
ABT-737 resistance by gossypol. Gossypol induces NOXA that binds to p-Mcl-1 and displaces Bim from the Mcl-1/Bim complex, leading to cell death that is
augmented by Mcl-1s (splice variant) generation by gossypol treatment. IP, immunoprecipitation.

within its PEST region and stabilizes it (20). It has been
suggested that Thr-163 is the priming phosphate that initiates
Ser-159 phosphorylation of Mcl-1 through GSK3b leading to its
ubiquitination and degradation (34). Clearly, phosphorylation
at Thr-163 but not subsequent Ser-159 phosphorylation on
Mcl-1 in ABT-R cells supports why Mcl-1 was more stable in
ABT-R compared with parental cells. Mcl-1 is a short-lived

protein and it is a target of E3 ubiquitin ligases that mediate its
proteasomal mediated degradation. Mcl-1 is inaccessible to E3ubiquitin ligases FBW7 and SCF b-TrCP when it is bound to
BH3-only proteins, such as Bim, as more association of Bim
with Mcl-1 prevents their access to Mcl-1. As there is competitive binding between these E3-ubiquitin ligases and BH3-only
proteins because they share the same C-terminal–binding

region of Mcl-1 (22), most likely, this could contribute toward
Mcl-1 stability, as more Bim is associated with Mcl-1 in ABT-R
cells.
Approaches to overcome resistance toward a single agent
rely on targeting cells with another agent to exploit dependability of cells on the resistance determinant. Response to
chronic exposure to ABT-737 leads to displacement of Bim
from Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, and Bcl-w, which is then captured by another
prosurvival protein, Mcl-1. In ABT-737–resistant cells levels of
Mcl-1, its stability and afﬁnity toward Bim is increased, making
them Mcl-1 dependent. To target this induced Mcl-1 primed
with Bim in ABT-R cells, 2 pan-Bcl-2 family antagonists were
examined. Gossypol has a signiﬁcant antitumor activity
against lymphoma, head and neck, and prostate cancer
through induction of NOXA and PUMA (35–37). Obatoclax is
a small molecule that disrupts interaction between Mcl-1 and
Bak and hence shows potential to overcome ABT-737 resistance (27). Although obatoclax was effective against ABT-R
cells, it did not have speciﬁcity for ABT-737–resistant cells. In
contrast, gossypol emerges from this study as a very potent
compound against ABT-737–resistant leukemic cells that
could target Mcl-1 indirectly by inducing NOXA. We have
previously reported that primary cells from CLL patients with
elevated Mcl-1 levels are less responsive to ABT-737 (5). Here
we show that gossypol preferentially targets ABT-R with
elevated Mcl-1, presumably, that is also phosphorylated
Mcl-1 found in cells and causes cell death by inducing NOXA.
shRNA-mediated downregulation of Mcl-1 in ABT-R cells
decreased gossypol sensitivity, indicating that elevated levels
of Mcl-1 are the cause of gossypol sensitivity in conjunction
with NOXA induction following gossypol treatment. NOXA
induction in our study is at the mRNA level. The resulting
increased NOXA levels following gossypol treatment then
associate with Mcl-1, leading to release of Bim from the
Bim/Mcl-1 complex and thereby neutralize the antiapoptotic
function of Mcl-1. Mcl-1–free Bim then initiates Bax/Bak
activation (38, 39) and triggers the mitochondrial apoptotic
pathway. A similar mechanism was reported to be responsible
for apoptosis induced by bortezomib in multiple myeloma (31)
and HeLa cells following ER stress and proteasome inhibition
(40). NOXA was reported to have the highest binding afﬁnity to
Mcl-1 compared with other antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members (41–45). Moreover, as following NOXA knockdown
Bim is no longer released from the Mcl-1/Bim complex in
ABT-R cells, hence NOXA speciﬁcally displaces Bim from Mcl-1
in these cells following gossypol treatment. Gossypol-induced
cell death was clearly NOXA dependent as prevention of NOXA
expression signiﬁcantly prevented cell death.
Generation of an alternative, proapoptotic splice variant of
Mcl-1, Mcl-1(s) has also a signiﬁcant contribution to gossypol-

induced cell death. Mcl-1(s) was not generated by caspasemediated proteolytic cleavage, as suggested earlier (30–32), as
zVAD-fmk addition prevented caspase-3 activation but not the
appearance of this faster migrating form of Mcl-1 corresponding to Mcl-1(s). Mcl-1 mRNA induction by gossypol facilitated
generation of Mcl-1(s), which can also contribute to mitochondrial cell death pathway. Moreover, gossypol-induced cell
death was NOXA dependent as prevention of NOXA expression
signiﬁcantly prevented cell death. In summary, gossypolinduced cell death is dependent on Mcl-1 expression and its
phosphorylation in ABT-R cells that is targeted by NOXA
induction and subsequent binding to Mcl-1, thereby displacing
Bim, leading to cell death (Fig. 6D and E). Gossypol, a natural
product, has been shown to be effective in inducing apoptosis
as well as autophagy-mediated cell death in various cancer cell
lines and xenograft tumor models as pan–Bcl-2 inhibitor (35,
36, 46). It is possible that apogosspyol, its semisynthetic
derivative with structural modiﬁcations that increase its afﬁnity for antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins and reduces its toxic effects
could be also effective in ABT-737–resistant patients, as both
are under evaluation in phase I/II clinical trials for CLL and
several other malignancies, such as prostate, lung, and brain
tumors. These ﬁndings provide insights into the molecular
mechanism of ABT-737 resistance and how it can be overcome
with gossypol, which can be considered for clinical treatment
of navitoclax-resistant leukemia patients.
