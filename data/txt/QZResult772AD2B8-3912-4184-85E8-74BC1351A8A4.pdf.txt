BACKGROUND: Two randomized trials have demonstrated improved progression-free survival (PFS) with lenalidomide maintenance
after autologous transplantation for multiple myeloma (MM). Overall survival (OS) results are conflicting, and quality-of-life (QOL)
data are lacking. The authors conducted a systematic survey of patients with MM regarding what constitutes a meaningful benefit
that would make burdens of maintenance treatments (toxicity and cost) acceptable. METHODS: A self-administered survey was
mailed to 1159 consecutive, living patients who were evaluated at Mayo Clinic. The survey provided background information on the
standard of care for MM and data on maintenance. Patients were asked to estimate the magnitude of OS benefit that would be acceptable for various degrees of toxicity and cost. RESULTS: Of 1159 surveys sent, 886 patients (83.2%) responded, and 736 patients
returned a completed survey (66% raw response rate). The most worrisome potential toxicity was identified as peripheral neuropathy
by 27% of patients, cytopenias by 24%, deep vein thrombosis by 20%, fatigue by 15%, nausea by 8%, and diarrhea=constipation by
7%. If treatment was free, had no toxicity, and the OS benefit was 1 year, then 49% of patients indicated that they would choose
maintenance; with moderate toxicity, this proportion decreased to 42%. Adding a treatment cost of $25 per month decreased the
proportion that would choose maintenance to 39% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that willingness to
receive maintenance treatment declined when actual benefits were provided in concrete numeric terms compared with a general
statement of PFS benefit. The authors also observed that the magnitude of benefit required to consider maintenance was affected by

INTRODUCTION
Over the past 40 years, several maintenance strategies for the treatment of multiple myeloma have been investigated. In
the 1960s to early 1980s, continuous conventional chemotherapy was assessed and demonstrated the ability to prolong
relapse-free survival, but not to prolong overall survival.1-6 In the 1980s and 1990s, interferon was pursued as a maintenance strategy. Two large meta-analyses ultimately concluded that interferon significantly improved both progression-free
survival and overall survival. Investigators indicated that they believed the overall survival benefit after assessing approximately 4000 patients was approximately 6 months.7,8 In the 1990s and 2000s, thalidomide was the maintenance treatment of interest and also demonstrated prolonged progression-free survival and possibly overall survival in metaanalyses.9,10 None of these strategies are currently recommended routinely.
Recently, both lenalidomide and bortezomib have been investigated as maintenance strategies and have demonstrated benefits in progression-free survival and overall survival similar to the strategies used over the previous 30 to 40
years. In 2012, 2 large trials of lenalidomide, 1 in the United States and 1 in Europe, were published. Each group presented a final assessment of such a strategy after autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, and both demonstrated an approximately 18-month prolongation of progression-free survival. Whereas the US trial (Cancer and
Leukemia Group B [CALGB]) demonstrated an increase in overall survival at 3 years (85% vs 77%), the European trial
(French Myeloma Intergroup [IFM]) did not.11,12 Although lesser evidence exists for the use of bortezomib as maintenance, the benefit described appears to be similar.13-18

Treatment Trade-Offs in Myeloma/Burnette et al

With improved toxicity compared with maintenance strategies of chemotherapy, interferon, and thalidomide, both lenalidomide and bortezomib have been
rapidly incorporated into clinical practice. With any treatment strategy, there are associated toxicities, financial burdens, and risks of adverse events which can be considered
“trade-offs” to the benefits in clinical parameters (progression-free or overall survival). To our knowledge only 1
study (assessing interferon) has investigated actual patient
preferences regarding maintenance, and no study has
investigated patient preferences regarding modern maintenance for the treatment of multiple myeloma.19 With
the complexity of the data, we sought to describe the
meaningful clinical benefit our patients were willing to
accept to choose to undergo maintenance for a given toxicity and financial burden.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Methods

A brief, self-administered survey was developed by the
investigators. The study and the survey document were
approved by the Mayo Clinic Foundation Institutional
Review Board. In total, 1200 patients were identified who
had been evaluated consecutively at the Mayo Clinic
through December 14, 2011. The list was crossreferenced for recent deaths, and a total of 1159 living
patients were identified. The survey was mailed to the
1159 patients in January 2012. The survey was mailed to
nonresponders in both February and March of 2012. In
April 2012, nonresponders were contacted by the Mayo
Clinic Survey Research Center as a reminder to complete
the survey.
Mailings included a cover letter and contact information for the principal investigator in case patients had
questions or concerns. Data entry was performed in duplicate by data entry specialists. Unclear entries were forwarded to the principal investigator for adjudication.
Survey

Briefly, patients were first asked to identify the single
most worrisome toxicity commonly associated with modern management strategies for multiple myeloma. Next
patients were asked to answer the following question with
both mild and moderate toxicity: If maintenance treatment
caused you to have MILD side effects and is not known to
prolong your life, but was known to delay the time until you
were to need treatment again, would you want to take this
treatment (yes or no)?
The next section of the survey began with the following statement: “ The average overall survival (length of life
Cancer

December 15, 2013

from the initial diagnosis of multiple myeloma) is 5 years.
The following questions ask how much improvement in your
overall survival you would need to achieve to be willing to
experience=tolerate side effects. Assume the maintenance medication is available, free, and convenient for you to access.”
Patients were then asked to identify the minimal incremental increase in overall survival he or she would need to
experience to be willing to choose treatment for a given
toxicity.
The next section of the survey began with the following statement: “ The cost of medicine can be a significant
issue for patients. Currently, the cost of the maintenance
treatment described in the following questions is approximately $10,000 per month. In the following questions, we
want to know how the cost of medicine matters in your decisions about which medicines to take. Please answer the following questions assuming you would experience MILD side
effects.” Patients were then asked which minimum incremental increase in overall survival would make them
choose treatment for a given cost of the medication per
month ($25, $250, or $10,000). The same 3 questions
were then asked, but with an expectation for moderate
toxicity.
Simple demographic and disease-specific questions
followed. The following data were collected from
respondents: age, distance from the Mayo Clinic, total
number of medications taken per day, sex, time since diagnosis of multiple myeloma, whether the patient had
received any treatment for multiple myeloma, whether
the patient’s physician had discussed maintenance treatments, and whether the patient had undergone a bone
marrow transplantation.
RESULTS
Of the 1159 surveys, 886 patients (83.2%) responded,
including 150 who notified us of a decision not to participate. In total, 736 patients returned a completed survey
(66% raw response rate). Table 1 summarizes demographics and disease characteristics.
The most worrisome toxicity was identified as
“numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands and feet” by
190 patients (27%), “low blood counts (which would
increase the risk of infections)” by 172 patients (24%),
“blood clots in the legs” by 143 patients (20%), “fatigue”
by 104 patients (15%), “nausea=heartburn=reflux” by 59
patients (8%), and “diarrhea or constipation” by 48
patients (7%). In response to the yes-or-no question about
whether the patient would choose maintenance if there
was a progression-free survival benefit but no improvement in overall survival, 92% would opt for maintenance

if it were known to cause mild toxicity, whereas 77%
would opt for maintenance despite moderate toxicity.
Subsequent questions included cost and toxicity
considerations and required patients to identify a minimum incremental increase in overall survival that would
make maintenance acceptable to the patient to estimate
more precisely his or her meaningful clinical benefit. If
treatment was free, without toxicity, and the incremental
increase in overall survival was 1 year or less, then 354
patients (49%) would choose maintenance. If the associated toxicity was mild, then 335 patients (46%) would
choose maintenance; and, with moderate toxicity, 305
patients (42%) would choose maintenance. Figure 1 and
Table 2 detail the distribution of responses.
With rising financial burden (out-of-pocket) and
toxicity, the proportion of patients who choose maintenance declined. If the cost of maintenance was $25 per
month, associated with mild toxicity, and the incremental
increase in overall survival was 1 year or less, the 333
4310

patients (46%) would choose maintenance. A moderate
increase in cost to $250 per month did not affect the proportion choosing maintenance; 320 patients (44%) would
continue to opt for maintenance. Corresponding rates
with moderate toxicity were 298 patients (41%) and 276
patients (39%) with costs of $25 per month and $250 per
month, respectively (Fig. 2). However, with a marked
increase in cost to $10,000 per month, the proportion
who would choose maintenance with mild or moderate
toxicity decreased to 232 patients (32%) and 226 patients
(32%), respectively.
A univariate analysis was performed for each of the
following situations: free and no toxicity, free and mild
toxicity, free and moderate toxicity, $25 per month and
mild toxicity, $25 per month and moderate toxicity, $250
per month and mild toxicity, and $250 per month and
moderate toxicity. Male gender was strongly associated
with a decreased requirement for incremental overall survival benefit to make patients choose maintenance in all 7
situations of toxicity and cost (P < 0.03). Increasing age
was associated with a decreased incremental increase in
overall survival required to choose maintenance treatment
in 5 of 7 situations of toxicity and cost (P < 0.05). Time
since diagnosis, number of current medications, distance
from Mayo Clinic, having discussed maintenance with a
physician, and having undergone autologous stem cell
transplantation were not associated significantly with the
overall survival benefit required to choose treatment.
DISCUSSION
Significant gains in the treatment of myeloma have been
achieved over the last several decades. Novel agents and
combinations have led to patients living longer and living
better with multiple myeloma than at any time in history.
One of the most significant advances has been that of
high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell support. Such therapy was explored in the late 1970s20 and
throughout the 1980s in single-arm analyses.21,22 It was
not until the late 1990s and early 2000s, however, that 2
large randomized clinical trials demonstrated a clear overall survival benefit of at least 1 year compared with conventional therapy.23,24
Although earlier experiences with maintenance after
both conventional chemotherapy and high-dose therapy
had previously been disappointing, the development of
the immunomodulating agents thalidomide and lenalidomide as well as the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib signaled the introduction of drugs with greater activity and
potentially less toxicity.25-39 Thalidomide was the first to
be assessed as maintenance after high-dose therapy.

Whereas initial reports described a definite increase in
progression-free survival, data for an overall survival benefit were conflicting. In addition, thalidomide was difficult
to tolerate in this setting, with significant neuropathy, fatigue, nausea, and insomnia, such that 30% to 50%
of patients discontinued maintenance because of toxicCancer

systematic review of 360 randomized clinical trials for
multiple myeloma reported in the literature from 1990 to
2008 and identified only 15 that had included an assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) as a primary or secondary endpoint (2 as primary endpoints).45
Fortunately, over the last few years, several investigators
have begun to describe HRQOL in different aspects of
multiple myeloma.
Stewart and colleagues in 2010 presented quality-oflife data from a large Canadian trial of maintenance thalidomide and prednisone versus observation after high-dose
therapy. Patients on maintenance experienced worse
HRQOL in physical, role, cognitive, and global domains
as well as significantly worse symptoms, including dyspnea, constipation, thirst, lower extremity edema, peripheral neuropathy, xerostomia, and imbalance.41 Several
studies have described the HRQOL of high-dose therapy
versus conventional therapy and have demonstrated that,
whereas the HRQOL typically is less during the first 6 to
12 months after high-dose therapy, after approximately
18 months, patients who received high-dose therapy
appeared to have at least a similar, if not improved,
HRQOL.46-48 Acaster and colleagues recently surveyed a
370 patients in the United Kingdom with multiple myeloma and reported that, after the diagnosis of multiple
4312

myeloma, patients have the greatest quality of life during
the first treatment-free interval and have a better quality
of life with a longer first treatment-free interval.49
Although these few reports have offered additional
insight into HRQOL and patient perspectives, such data
remain far from optimal. Recently, the Center for Medical Technology Policy (www.cmtpnet.org), a nonprofit
and independent organization with a mission to improve
the quality, relevance, and efficiency of health care
research, proposed recommendations to incorporate
patient-reported outcomes into clinical trials in adult oncology.50 We fully support such recommendations and
hope they can be rapidly accepted and implemented in
clinical trials for multiple myeloma.
With thalidomide’s survival benefit in the maintenance setting, its use in routine clinical practice has been
limited by the diminished quality of life as well as the discontinuation because of toxicity. With the increased tolerability of lenalidomide, further results of the IFM and
CALGB trials of lenalidomide maintenance are eagerly
awaited. We share the concerns of the editorialist who
noted the lack of quality-of-life endpoints in all 3 maintenance lenalidomide studies.11,12,51,52 Whereas proponents argue that lenalidomide maintenance is tolerated
better than the previously investigated thalidomide or
Cancer

Treatment Trade-Offs in Myeloma/Burnette et al

interferon, it should be noted that the discontinuation
rate of lenalidomide because of toxicity in the IFM trial
was nearly 30%, and the grade 3 or 4 adverse hematologic
event rate was nearly 60%, which was similar to earlier
maintenance trials.12 The rate of discontinuation and the
rate of adverse events were substantially less in the
CALGB trial, but this may be because approximately
80% of patients had received lenalidomide (and presumably tolerated it well) as an induction agent.11
Although HRQOL, progression-free survival, overall survival, drug cost, toxicity, and availability are all important considerations when a physician recommends or
when a patient chooses to receive maintenance, very little
evidence exists regarding the priorities and preferences
patients use to define a meaningful clinical benefit or
degree of toxicity he or she is willing to tolerate. In a survey in the middle 1990s, patients with myeloma generally
indicated that a 6-month increase in overall survival
would make the toxicity of maintenance interferon acceptable.19 To our knowledge, that study remains the
only published study describing, at least on a limited basis,
patient preferences and what may constitute a meaningful
clinical benefit for the patient.
It is noteworthy that we observed several characteristics that one could speculate may influence decisions by
patients regarding maintenance but did not seem to influence such decisions. Such characteristics included: time
since diagnosis, number of current medications, distance
from Mayo Clinic, having discussed maintenance with a
physician, and having undergone autologous stem cell
transplantation. The only characteristic that appeared to
clearly affect the decision-making process across all categories of cost and toxicity was sex. The reasons why men
required less overall survival increase to accept treatment
may be illusive and are beyond the scope of this report.
The differences in how the sexes approach such decisions,
however, have obvious implications for routine clinical
practice as well as for consideration of maintenance
therapies.
For the first time, we have demonstrated a broad
range of benefit in overall survival for which patients are
willing to accept a given degree of expense and toxicity.
Rather than using an investigator-derived grading system,
such as Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events, CTCAE, we deliberately did not define the terms
mild and moderate toxicity. It is our impression that such
definitions are patient-specific, with vast differences in
what individual patients consider mild or moderate symptoms. Few patients (approximately 10-12) called and
asked for a definition of the degree of toxicity. When the
Cancer

December 15, 2013

principle investigator was queried by the patient, he
defined mild toxicity as “inconvenient” and moderate toxicity as “a detriment to your quality of life.” In this manner, we believe that our patient’s perspectives were more
accurately reflected.
Weaknesses of our study involve those inherent with
survey-based research, especially in asking patients about
such “hypothetical” decisions. It is noteworthy that one of
our observations was that a much greater proportion of
patients choose maintenance when asked in a “yes-or-no”
fashion and when there was no evidence for an overall survival benefit when it was associated with mild or moderate
toxicity than there were patients who identified <6
months or one year as necessary to accept mild or moderate toxicity associated with maintenance. We believe this
underscores the difficulty patients have, despite our simple explanation of the current standard of care, in understanding the concept of progression-free survival versus
overall survival. Although we sent the survey to patients
who were dealing with complications of myeloma, with
many in the last year(s) of life, and asked emotional questions that required patients to reflect on mortality, we
greatly exceeded our expectations with nearly a 70%
response rate, which is similar to that described in the
United Kingdom survey noted above. This suggests that
patients with multiple myeloma are motivated to be
involved in research and are invested in their care.
Recently, our group proposed an approach to maintenance for multiple myeloma that generally would avoid
those patients who have a very good partial response, a
complete response, or a stringent complete response.53,54
It is our impression that such patients often experience a
durable remission that can continue for 5, 10, or even 15
years or more; and, for these patients, maintenance would
be less likely to produce a benefit, but they still would be
subject to the not insignificant toxicity and financial burden of treatment.
In personal communication with patients who contacted us with regard to the survey, patients had a wide
range of perspectives and preferences. On one end of the
spectrum was a patient of the principal investigator’s, who
stated that, without maintenance, she is currently able to
“think about” her multiple myeloma once every 3 months
and that maintenance would cause her to “think about”
her myeloma daily. Consistent with this perspective, she
chose not to fill out the survey, because it would have
required her to “think about” her myeloma. On the other
end of the spectrum, a gentleman who had had myeloma
for over 3 years stated that he would tolerate “ANY” toxicity and “ANY” expense to gain a “single day” of life. Such
4313

Original Article

a dramatic difference in perspectives of the 2 patients has
obvious implications for providing personalized
recommendations.
With the evidence presented herein, we believe it is
inappropriate to recommend for or against maintenance
without having a detailed discussion with patients regarding definitions of mild or moderate toxicity, willingness
to tolerate toxicity, ability to afford treatment, and what
constitutes a meaningful clinical benefit. We strongly recommend detailed conversations with patients regarding
maintenance to optimize an individual’s management
strategy to be most consistent with his or her priorities.
This is not a discussion that should be exclusive to academic transplant centers, but a discussion that should
occur between the provider with the closest relationship
to the patient, including both academic and community
hematologists and oncologists.
