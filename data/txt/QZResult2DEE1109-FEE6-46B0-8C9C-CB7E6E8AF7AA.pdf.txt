ABSTRACT
The MDM2 oncogene has been suggested as a molecular target for treating
human cancers, including breast cancer. Most MDM2 inhibitors under development
are targeting the MDM2-p53 binding, and have little or no effects on cancers without
functional p53, such as advanced breast cancer. The present study was designed
to develop a new class of MDM2 inhibitors that exhibit anticancer activity in MDM2dependent and p53-independent manners. The selective MDM2 inhibitors were
discovered by a computational structure-based screening, yielding a lead compound,
termed JapA. We further found that JapA inhibited cell growth, decreased cell
proliferation, and induced G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis in breast cancer cells
through an MDM2-dependent mechanism, regardless of p53 status. It also inhibited
the tumor growth and lung metastasis in breast cancer xenograft models without
causing any host toxicity. Furthermore, JapA directly bound to MDM2 protein and
reduced MDM2 levels in cancer cells in vitro and in vivo by promoting MDM2 protein
degradation and inhibiting MDM2 transcription, which is distinct from the existing
MDM2 inhibitors. In conclusion, JapA represents a new class of MDM2 inhibitor that
exerts its anticancer activity through directly down-regulating MDM2, and might be
developed as a novel cancer therapeutic agent.

INTRODUCTION

However, for most breast cancer patients with advanced
disease, especially those with triple negative breast cancer
(TNBC; lacking the expression of the estrogen receptor,
progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2), there are few or no effective treatment
options, and the prognosis remains poor [8-10]. One
of the major hurdles in the treatment and prevention of
breast cancer is the lack of a good understanding of the
underlying mechanisms responsible for the development
and progression of this disease, including its recurrence,
metastasis and resistance to treatment. Increasing evidence

Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death
among women in the United States and worldwide [1].
Thanks to recent advances in several fronts of breast
cancer research, such as the identification of risk factors,
molecular mechanisms of oncogenesis, imaging and
screening strategies for early detection, the development
of the genetic/genomic and molecular diagnosis, as
well as targeted therapy, the prognosis and survival of
patients with breast cancer have been improving [2-7].

suggests that the loss of tumor suppressors, such as p53
and BRCA, and the overexpression of oncogenes, such as
MDM2 and NFAT1, play important roles in the progression
of breast cancer to advanced disease [11-18]. These
findings provide novel molecular targets for the treatment
of breast cancer.
The MDM2 oncogene is a major negative regulator
of the tumor suppressor p53 [19], and there is an
MDM2-p53 feedback auto-regulatory pathway: p53 is a
positive regulator of MDM2 expression, while MDM2
directly binds to p53 and represses its transcriptional
activity and promotes p53 degradation [19-20]. MDM2
also exerts oncogenic activities in a p53-independent
fashion [21-24]. In cancer patients with tumors harboring
mutant p53 or without p53 expression, including breast
cancer patients, MDM2 overexpression is still found to
be involved in cancer growth and metastasis [17, 2526]. We and others have demonstrated that MDM2 is a
promising molecular target for cancer therapy [21, 24,
27-30]. To date, most small molecule inhibitors (SMIs)
of MDM2 have been designed to block the MDM2-p53
interaction [31], such as Nutlin-3 [32], RITA [33], MI219 [34], AMG232 [35], and SAR405838 [36]. These
MDM2 SMIs induce apoptosis of cancer cells harboring
wild-type p53, but have low or no efficacy against cancer
cells containing mutant or deficient p53. Because over 6088% of advanced breast cancer especially TNBC harbors
mutant p53 [11, 37-38], no significant anticancer activity
of these MDM2 SMIs is expected in these types of cancer.
Therefore, new strategies to target MDM2 are desirable.
Considering that MDM2 exerts its oncogenic
functions via both p53-dependent and –independent
mechanisms, it is urgently needed to identify compounds
that directly inhibit MDM2 and exhibit the anticancer
activity, regardless of p53 status of the cancer cells.
We have developed a virtual screening method to
identify small molecules that have direct inhibitory
effects on MDM2 [3, 39]. From our initial screening of
a natural product library, we have identified a series of
sesquiterpenoid and disesquiterpenoid compounds (Figure
1A) as a new class of MDM2 inhibitors. Among these
potential hits, a novel C11, C3’-linked eudesmanolideguaianolide disesquiterpenoid compound, named JapA
(Figure 1A), was shown to be the most active agent. The
present study was designed to investigate the in vitro
and in vivo anti-breast cancer activity of JapA and the
underlying molecular mechanisms of action. Our results
would help demonstrate the therapeutic potentials of
targeting MDM2 itself and provide a basis for further
preclinical and clinical development of JapA as an antibreast cancer agent, especially for the TNBC treatment.

Identification of JapA and its analogs as a new
class of MDM2 inhibitors
In our previous studies, we have developed a
computational structure-based screening method to
identify compounds that specifically target MDM2 [3,
39]. The docking of virtual compounds that could bind
to MDM2 protein was undertaken using the Maestro 9.0
software program (Schrodiger) [3, 39]. Based on this
method, we recently performed a screening of a natural
product based library and selected 35 top candidates with
excellent binding affinity to MDM2 protein for further
investigation (Figure 1A). These candidate compounds
were further tested in more than 50 cell lines of various
cancer types in our lab and breast cancer was among the
most sensitive cancer types. We found that each of these
compounds showed comparable cytotoxicity in MCF7 (ER positive and p53 wild-type) and MDA-MB-231
(triple negative and p53 mutant) breast cancer cell lines
(Figure 1B). In addition, α-methylene-γ-lactone group
plays a crucial role in the inhibitory effects of these
compounds against breast cancer cells (Figures 1A and
1B). The disesquiterpenoid compounds, i.e. JapA, InuA,
and IL18, exhibited more potent cytotoxicity than the
sesquiterpenoids (Figures 1A and 1B). JapA (Figure 1A)
was selected as a lead compound based on its IC50 values
(Figure 1B) and significant inhibitory effects on MDM2
expression in breast cancer cells.

In vitro anti-breast cancer activity of lead
compound JapA
The inhibitory effects of JapA on cell viability and
MDM2 protein levels were confirmed in normal human
breast cell lines and human breast cancer cell lines with
different p53 and MDM2 statuses. As shown in Figure 2A,
2 μM JapA significantly reduced the MDM2 expression
levels in MCF-7, MCF-7/p53-/- (p53 knockdown), MDAMB-231, and MDA-MB-468 (p53 mutant) breast cancer
cell lines. However, no apparent effect of JapA on MDM2
was observed at the same concentration in human breast
epithelial MCF-10A and human mammary luminal
epithelial (HMLE) cell lines. The IC50 values of JapA
against these breast cancer cell lines ranged from 0.5 to
2.0 μM (Figure 2B). The MCF-10A and HMLE cell lines
were much less sensitive to the compound than breast
cancer cell lines, suggesting that JapA has a selective
cytotoxicity for cancer cells and exerts its activity in an
MDM2-dependent fashion, regardless of the p53 status.
JapA also inhibited the cell colony formation in a
concentration-dependent manner in the MCF-7 and MDAMB-231 cell lines (Figure 2C). Similar to the effects on

cell viability, JapA inhibited the proliferation of cancer
cell lines (Figure 2D); at a concentration of 5 μM, JapA
inhibited the proliferation by about 52% (P < 0.01) and
51% (P < 0.01) in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells,
respectively. In addition to inhibiting cell proliferation,
JapA treatment arrested cells in G2/M phase, with initial
effects beginning at the 1 μM concentration (P < 0.01)
(Figure 2E). We also observed that JapA induced apoptosis
in both breast cancer cell lines, regardless of their p53
status (Figure 2F). In the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells,
5 μM JapA increased the apoptotic index by 7.6-fold (P <
0.01) and 3.2-fold (P < 0.01), respectively, compared to
control cells.

Nude mice bearing MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
xenograft tumors were treated with JapA by i.p. injection
at doses of 15 or 30 mg/kg/d, 5 d/week, for 5 weeks and
3 weeks, respectively. Dose-dependent tumor growth
inhibition was observed in both models. As shown in
Figure 3A, two dose levels of JapA (15 and 30 mg/kg)
inhibited MCF-7 xenograft tumor growth by about 77%
and 87%, respectively (P < 0.01). Same doses caused 56%
and 72% inhibition in MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumor

model, respectively (P < 0.01) (Figure 3B). Of note, there
were no remarkable changes in the average body weights
in either model, suggesting that the treatment did not lead
to overt toxicity (Figures 3C and 3D).
To further demonstrate the inhibitory effects of JapA
on MDM2 in vivo, we evaluated the protein expression
levels of MDM2 and p53 in the xenograft tumors. As
shown in Figure 3E, the protein levels of MDM2 were
significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner in both

models, whereas the protein expression of wild-type p53
in the MCF-7 xenograft model was increased by JapA.
No significant change in the levels of mutant p53 in the
MDA-MB-231 tumors was observed. These results were
confirmed by an immunohistochemical analysis in both
models (Figure 3F).
Advanced human breast cancer, such as TNBC,
is characterized by distant metastasis to various
organs, especially the lungs and bone [9-11]. In MDA-

MB-231 TNBC xenograft model, we also examined the
development of distant metastasis and found that JapA
inhibited lung metastasis, with the incidence of lung
metastasis being 5/7, 3/8, and 1/7 in the vehicle-, 15
mg/kg/d JapA-, and 30 mg/kg/d JapA-treated groups,
respectively (Figure 3G). There were no significant
differences in the histological findings among the
treatment and control groups in any of the other tissues
examined (liver, kidney, spleen and brain) (Figure 4),
indicating that JapA may not cause toxicity in these organs
at the effective doses.

ability to block the intracellular MDM2-p53 interaction.
Although the immunoprecipitation assays showed the
dissociation of MDM2-p53 complex by JapA in MCF7 cells, this compound also caused significant downregulation of MDM2 and up-regulation of p53 in doseand time-dependent manners (Figures 5D and 5E), which
is different from the existing MDM2 inhibitors. We
next sought to determine whether JapA directly binds to
MDM2 protein in intact cells by employing the cellular
thermal shift assay. Using this target engagement assay,
we observed that JapA efficiently bound to MDM2 protein
in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines (Figure 5F).
We further demonstrated that JapA decreased the MDM2
protein expression in breast cancer cells and normal breast
cells in a concentration-dependent manner, independent of
p53 (Figure 5G). However, 5 µM JapA failed to reduce
MDM2 protein level in normal HMLE cells, indicating a
lower response of normal cells to JapA treatment (Figure
5G). In addition, this MDM2 inhibition resulted in p53
activation in MCF-7 and HMLE cells and an increase in
the expression levels of p21 in all three cell lines (Figure
5G). The JapA-induced down-regulation of the MDM2
protein was confirmed by immunofluorescence detection
in breast cancer cell lines. The staining for MDM2 in both
nucleus and cytoplasm was markedly decreased by JapA
in the treated cells in comparison with control cells (Figure
5H).

Mechanism of action of MDM2 inhibition by lead
compound JapA
To explore the underlying molecular mechanisms
responsible for JapA-induced MDM2 inhibition, a
molecular modeling study of JapA and MDM2 was carried
out. As shown in Figures 5A and 5B, JapA could bind in
the hydrophobic pocket of MDM2 that is occupied by
key p53 residues (Phe19, Trp23, and Leu26). We further
evaluated the binding affinity of JapA to MDM2 protein
using a fluorescence polarization (FP)-based binding
assay. The results indicated that JapA bound to MDM2
protein with a Ki value of 0.27 μM (Figure 5C), showing
a higher binding affinity than a p53 peptide (residues
16-27, Ki = 1.2 μM). JapA was further evaluated for its

Figure 4: No host toxicity caused by JapA treatment. JapA was administered for 3 weeks by i.p. injection to nude mice bearing

MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumors. At the end of the experiments, H&E staining of the paraffin-embedded sections of various tissues (liver,
kidney, spleen, and brain) obtained from mice were performed to assess whether there were any abnormalities caused by the treatment
(scale bar, 50 µm).

Effects of lead compound JapA on MDM2 protein
stability

in the MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 6A). However,
treatment with MG-132, a proteasome inhibitor, reduced
the MDM2 protein degradation by JapA in both cell lines
(Figure 6B), suggesting that the JapA-induced MDM2
degradation is proteasome-dependent. These results were
paralleled by the observation that JapA induced MDM2
ubiquitination (Figure 6C). Taken together, these results
indicate that JapA treatment leads to increased MDM2
degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.
Considering that MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and that
its degradation largely depends on autoubiquitination [40],

We next explored how JapA reduced the MDM2
protein level. In the presence of cycloheximide (CHX), a
protein synthesis inhibitor, JapA increased the degradation
rate of the MDM2 protein in both MCF-7 and MDAMB-231 cells (Figure 6A). The half-life of wild-type p53
was prolonged in MCF-7 cells, while no significant change
in the half-life of the mutant p53 protein was observed

followed by exposure to a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (CHX, 15 µg/mL). The MDM2 and p53 protein levels were detected

The cells were co-transfected with MDM2 and ubiquitin plasmids, followed by treatment with JapA for 24 h. Cell lysates were subjected
to immunoprecipitation with an MDM2 antibody. The ubiquitinated MDM2 was detected using an anti-ubiquitin antibody. (D) The cells
were transfected with a wild-type MDM2 plasmid or a mutant MDM2 plasmid (C464A) without E3 ligase activity, followed by exposure

data. All of the experiments were repeated three times.

we wanted to delineate whether JapA induces MDM2
autoubiquitination. To address this possibility, MCF-7
and MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with MDM2 or
an MDM2 mutant (C464A) without E3 ubiquitin ligase
activity, followed by JapA treatment. As shown in Figure
6D, JapA induced the degradation of wild-type MDM2,
but not mutant MDM2 (C464A). These findings led us
to conclude that JapA destabilizes the MDM2 protein
by inducing its autoubiquitination and proteasomal
degradation in breast cancer cells.

fold OE of MDM2 protein expression (Figure 8A). Tetinduced MDM2 OE reduced the effects of JapA on MDM2
protein expression and p53 activation (Figure 8A), colony
formation (Figure 8B), and cell apoptosis (Figure 8C). In
inducible MDM2 KD cells, Tet treatment induced 76%
KD of MDM2 protein expression. The effects of JapA on
MDM2 protein expression and p53 activation (Figure 8D),
colony formation (Figure 8E), and cell apoptosis (Figure
8F) were enhanced by Tet-induced MDM2 KD. We further
demonstrated the role of MDM2 in JapA’s activity in
MDA-MB-231 cells (p53 mutant). As shown in Figures
9A and 9B, the transient transfection of a Myc-MDM2
plasmid resulted in MDM2 OE in MDA-MB-231 cells
(Figure 9A), which increased the cell growth and reduced
the cytotoxicity of JapA in the cells (Figure 9B). As shown
in Figures 9C and 9D, the transient transfection of MDM2
siRNA caused approximately 72% KD of MDM2 protein
expression (Figure 9C), decreased the cell growth, and
strengthened the inhibitory effects of JapA on cell viability
in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 9D). Taken together, these
results indicated that MDM2 plays a critical role for JapAinduced anti-breast cancer activity.

Effects of lead compound JapA on MDM2
transcription
We next explored whether JapA affects MDM2 at
the transcriptional level. As shown in Figure 7A, JapA
reduced the MDM2 mRNA levels in breast cancer cells in
a concentration-dependent manner, regardless of the p53
status. Although JapA down-regulated the MDM2 mRNA
level in normal breast HMLE cells, it had no significant
effect at 5 µM, which is an effective concentration in
breast cancer cells (Figure 7B). We then demonstrated that
JapA inhibited the MDM2 P2 promoter activity by using a
full-length reporter (Luc01) and various deletions (Figure
7C). The results showed decreased luciferase activities
for all of the reporters following JapA treatment in both
cell lines (Figures 7D and 7E), with the shortest deletion,
Luc 03 (-132 to +33), still showing a response to JapA.
The luciferase activity of the MDM2 reporter (Luc01) was
decreased 64% (P < 0.01) and 63% (P < 0.01) by JapA in
MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines, respectively; there
were no apparent changes in the cells transfected with
the corresponding empty vector reporter. To identify the
JapA-responsive site on the MDM2 P2 promoter, several
transcription factor sites-mutated P2 luciferase vectors,
i.e., with ETSα, AP1, MEF2, and NFAT mutations, were
transfected into MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, followed
by JapA treatment. As shown in Figures 7F and 7G, the
NFAT mutation effectively eliminated the response to
JapA, whereas the other three mutant vectors retained the
capacity to respond to the JapA treatment. Further studies
using vectors with double mutations (ΔAP1-ETSα) and
triple mutations (ΔAP1-ETSα-NFAT) also supported that
NFAT is mainly responsible for JapA’s inhibitory effects
on the MDM2 P2 promoter (Figures 7H and 7I).

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we identified a new MDM2
inhibitor JapA and investigated its in vitro and in vivo
anti-breast cancer activities and molecular mechanism
of action. We have made at least five novel discoveries
in this study. First, JapA and its analogs are a new class
of MDM2 inhibitors that directly target MDM2 at both
transcriptional and post-translational levels. These
compounds have comparable cytotoxicity against breast
cancer cells with different genetic backgrounds (p53
wild-type or mutant; ER positive or TNBC), indicating
a p53-independent and ER-independent mechanism of
action. Second, JapA selectively inhibits breast cancer
cell growth, reduces the cell colony formation and
proliferation, arrests cells in the G2/M phase, and induces
apoptosis through an MDM2-dependent mechanism,
independent of p53 status. Third, JapA suppresses breast
tumor growth and lung metastasis and inhibits MDM2
expression in vivo, regardless of the p53 status. Fourth,
JapA specifically binds to MDM2 protein and has a
better binding affinity than p53 peptide, and MDM2
expression is critical for JapA’s anti-breast cancer activity
as indicated in our assays using MDM2 overexpression
and knockdown breast cancer cells. Finally, JapA inhibits
MDM2 through blocking MDM2-p53 interaction,
promoting MDM2 protein degradation, and inhibiting
MDM2 transcription, which is distinct from the MDM2
inhibitors under development. These results not only
demonstrate the therapeutic potential of JapA as an antibreast cancer agent, but also support the notion that
targeting MDM2 itself is a promising therapeutic strategy
for advanced breast cancer.

Effects of MDM2 overexpression and knockdown
on JapA’s activity
To demonstrate the importance of MDM2 in JapA’s
anticancer activity, we further tested the inhibitory effects
of JapA on inducible MDM2 overexpression (OE) and
knockdown (KD) MCF-7 cell lines (p53 wild-type), in
comparison with their corresponding parental cell lines. In
inducible MDM2 OE cells, Tet treatment resulted in a 2.6www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

There is an increasing interest in developing
MDM2 inhibitors for cancer therapy. We and others have
demonstrated that there are at least three strategies to
target MDM2. First, block the MDM2-p53 interaction to
release p53 from MDM2 and activate the p53 pathway
in cancer cells [32-36, 41]. Second, inhibit MDM2’s
E3 ligase activity to stabilize p53 and activate the p53
pathway, such as JNJ-26854165 [42]. Third, directly
inhibit MDM2 expression to modulate both the p53dependent and –independent pathways [24]. Both the first
and second classes of MDM2 inhibitors require wild-type
p53 expression in cancer cells. However, the majority of
breast cancers contains mutant p53 and has high levels of
MDM2 [11, 37-38]; such cancers are less or unresponsive
to these types of MDM2 inhibitors. Therefore, we
designed this study to identify compounds that have direct

inhibitory effects on MDM2 for the treatment of cancer.
In the present study, JapA was demonstrated as a
novel and specific MDM2 inhibitor using several assays.
First, JapA showed stronger inhibitory effects on breast
cancer cell growth and better specificity in targeting
MDM2, in comparison with other candidate compounds.
Second, JapA exhibited its anticancer activity in MDM2dependent and p53-independent manners, as shown in
normal breast cell lines and breast cancer cell lines with
different MDM2 and p53 statuses. Our studies suggested
that the cell lines containing higher endogenous expression
levels of MDM2 have a better cell response to JapA,
which contributes to the specificity of JapA in inhibiting
cancer cells. Third, JapA specifically bound to the MDM2
protein as demonstrated in several assays, including
molecular docking, FP-based binding assay, and cellular

and knockdown MCF-7 cells were incubated with (+Tet; 1 μg/mL) or without tetracycline (-Tet) for 24 h and then treated by various
concentrations of JapA for (A, D) 24 h for the expression of MDM2 and p53; (B, E) 24 h for the colony formation assay; and (C, F) 48 h for
the cell apoptosis, which was determined by the Annexin V-FITC method. All assays were performed in triplicate (*P < 0.05 and #P < 0.01).

action of JapA-induced MDM2 inhibition are significantly
different from those of existing MDM2 inhibitors. Our
results indicated that JapA inhibited the MDM2-p53
binding and destabilized MDM2 protein by promoting
MDM2 auto-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.
It was also found that JapA inhibited MDM2 transcription
in an NFAT-dependent manner. Fifth, consistent with
antisense MDM2 inhibitors, JapA increased the expression
level of p21, which has been strongly implicated in tumor
initiation and progression, independent of p53 [43-44].
Finally, MDM2 plays a crucial role in the anticancer
activity of JapA, as shown in MDM2 overexpression and
knockdown breast cancer cell lines (both p53 wild-type
and mutant).
Of note, our studies indicated that JapA occupies
the hydrophobic pocket of MDM2 protein, inhibits the
interaction between MDM2 and p53, and destabilizes
MDM2 protein. However, it remains unknown that if the
binding of JapA to MDM2 is responsible for the rapid
degradation of MDM2. It is possible that JapA also binds
to other domains of MDM2 or targets other upstream
regulators of MDM2. It is known that the oncogene
MDMX, a closely related homolog of MDM2, is another

negative regulator of p53 and a valid molecular target for
cancer therapy [26, 29, 30]. Since MDMX has a great
structural similarity to MDM2, it is also probable that
MDMX may be also involved in the anticancer activity
of JapA. Although our in vitro and in vivo studies have
indicated a critical role of MDM2 in JapA’s anticancer
activity, further investigations on the identification and
validation of mechanisms using cutting-edge techniques
and state-of-the-art cancer models are required.
There are several reasons for selecting human breast
cancer as the target disease for this new class of MDM2
inhibitor. First, MDM2 is overexpressed in human breast
cancer and associated with breast cancer progression,
metastasis and drug resistance [13-15]. Second, in our
initial screening of various human cancer cell lines, breast
cancer cell lines were among the most sensitive cancer
types. Third, JapA inhibits breast cancer cell growth in
vitro and in vivo through inhibiting cell proliferation
and cell cycle progression and inducing apoptosis.
Fourth, similar in vitro and in vivo anticancer activity
was observed in the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 models,
suggesting that JapA is a promising anti-breast cancer
agent, regardless of the p53 status of the tumor. Fifth, JapA
did not show significant cytotoxicity to normal breast cell

lines and toxicity in mice, although the dose levels may
need to be optimized. Finally, considering that the MDAMB-231 model has been widely used as a model of TNBC
and breast cancer metastasis, our results suggest that JapA
will be useful to treat TNBC and metastatic breast cancer.
In summary, our present results demonstrate that
JapA directly inhibits MDM2, resulting in the inhibition
of breast tumor growth and metastasis, regardless of the
p53 status of cancer cells. This study provides evidence
supporting that directly targeting MDM2 is a promising
strategy for the discovery of novel anticancer agents.

media, fetal bovine serum, phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS), sodium pyruvate, non-essential amino acids, and
penicillin-streptomycin were obtained from Invitrogen
(Carlsbad, CA). The anti-human p53 (DO-1) antibody
was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Dallas, TX).
The anti-human MDM2 (Ab-2) and p21 (Ab-1) antibodies
were from Calbiochem (Billerica, MA). The anti-human
ubiquitin (6C1) and β-actin (AC-15) antibodies were
from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L)
and goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) were obtained from BioRad (Hercules, CA). The human full-length and deleted
MDM2 P2 promoter reporters were kind gifts from Dr.
J.P. Blaydes (Southampton General Hospital, UK). The
P2 promoter reporters lacking the MEF2, NFAT, and
ETS-α-AP1-NFAT binding sites were generated by
site-directed mutagenesis [49]. The wild-type MDM2
and mutant MDM2 (C464A without E3 ligase activity)
expression vectors were kindly provided by Dr. J. Chen
(Moffitt Cancer Center, USA). MDM2 siRNA or control
siRNA were from Thermo Scientific (Rockford, IL). Both
plasmids and siRNAs were transfected into cells using the
same protocols as reported by us earlier [3, 39].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and culture conditions
Human breast cancer (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231,
and MDA-MB-468) and non-malignant epithelial (MCF10A) cells were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Human mammary
luminal epithelial (HMLE) cells were obtained from ZenBio, Inc. (Research Triangle Park, NC). All cell culture
media, except that for the MCF-10A and HMLE cells,
contained 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were
grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s media containing
1 mM non-essential amino acids and Earle’s BSS, 1
mM sodium pyruvate and 10 mg/L bovine insulin. The
MCF-7 p53-/- cell line was established previously [4546] and was grown in the same media as MCF-7 cells,
but supplemented with 0.5% μg/mL puromycin (Sigma;
St. Louis, MO). MDA-MB-468 cells were grown in
DMEM/F-12 Ham’s media (1:1 mixture). MCF-10A cells
were grown in DMEM/F-12 Ham’s media containing 5%
horse serum, 20 ng/mL EGF, 0.5 mg/mL hydrocortisone,
100 ng/mL cholera toxin, 10 μg/mL insulin, and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin. HMLE cells were grown in
mammary luminal epithelial cell growth medium (ZenBio, Inc., NC). The inducible MDM2 overexpression (OE)
and knockdown (KD) MCF-7 cell lines were established
previously [47] and were grown in DMEM medium
containing 10 μg/mL blasticidin and 200 μg/mL zeocin
(OE cells) (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY), or 0.5% μg/mL
puromycin (KD cells) (Sigma; St. Louis, MO).

Assays for cell viability, colony formation, cell
proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and apoptosis
Cells were treated with various concentrations
of JapA, and cell viability, colony formation, cell
proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and apoptosis assays
were performed as described previously by us [45, 49-50].

Virtual screening and molecular modeling
The initial virtual screening of a natural product
library established in Dr. Wei-Dong Zhang’s laboratory
was performed as we reported previously [3, 39]. Briefly,
the docking of JapA and analogs with a refined structure
of MDM2 (PDB: 4ERE) was carried out using Maestro
9.0 software program (Schrodinger). After removing
the water molecules from the complex structure, the
‘Protein Preparation Wizard’ workflow was used to add
the hydrogen atoms and charges during a brief relaxation
using. The hydrogen bond network was then optimized
and the crystal structure was minimized using the OPLS
2005 force field, with the maximum RMSD value of
0.3Å. The grid-enclosing box was centered on the ligand
AM-8553 in the refined crystal structure and was defined
so as to enclose residues located within 14 Å from the
ligand. In the above step, a scaling factor of 1.0 was set
to van der Waals radii with a partial atomic charge of 0.25
to soften the nonpolar parts of the receptor. In this study,
the three-dimensional structures of all compounds were
generated using a Ligprep module. The extra precision
(XP) approaches were adopted successively.

Chemicals, reagents, antibodies, plasmids, and
siRNAs
The investigated compounds, including JapA, were
obtained from a natural product library established in Dr.
Wei-Dong Zhang’s laboratory, with their purity being
>95% (confirmed by IR, ESI-MS, NMR, and HPLC/
MSn) [48]. All chemicals and solvents were of the highest
analytical grade available. Cell culture supplies and

Assays for intracellular MDM2-p53 interaction

Assays for protein stability

The effect of JapA on intracellular MDM2-p53
interaction was determined as reported previously [3334]. Briefly, MCF-7 cells were treated with various
concentrations of JapA (0, 1, 2.5 and 5 µM) for 4 h or
exposed to 2 µM JapA for various times (0, 1, 4, and 8
h). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-p53
antibody at 4 oC overnight. The bound proteins were
purified with protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma, St Louis,
MO), resolved on SDS-PAGE, and detected by anti-p53
and anti-MDM2 antibodies. 1/10 of input cell lysates was
analyzed by Western blotting for the expression levels of
p53 and MDM2.

To determine the effect of JapA on the half-life of
MDM2 and p53 proteins, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
cells were treated with or without JapA (1 or 2 µM,
respectively) for 24 h. Cycloheximide (CHX, 15 µg/
mL) was then added and the cells were lysed at the
indicated times. The expression levels of MDM2 and
p53 were detected by western blotting. To determine the
effect of JapA on MDM2 and p53 protein degradation,
the cells were treated with or without JapA (1 or 2 µM,
respectively) for 24 h, followed by a 6-h treatment of MG132 (25 µM). Cell lysates were collected for the protein
expression levels of both MDM2 and p53.

Cellular thermal shift assay

Real-time quantitative PCR

The target binding ability of the test compound in
intact cells was evaluated using the cellular thermal shift
assay described previously [51]. Briefly, MCF-7 and
MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded into 6-cm dishes at a
density of 6 × 105 cells/well. After 24 h, cells were treated
with or without 5 µM JapA for 3 h. After treatment, cells
were harvested using trypsin, collected by centrifugation
and subsequently resuspended in PBS. Equal amounts of
cell suspensions were aliquoted into 12 PCR tubes and
heated for 3 min to 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58,
60, 62 or 64 oC. Cells were then lysed by three repeated
cycles of freeze-thawing. The precipitated proteins were
separated from the soluble fraction by centrifugation at
17,000 g for 20 min. The collected supernatants were used
for Western blotting.

Total RNA was extracted from human breast
cancer cells using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen,
Grand Island, NY), and a quantitative RT-PCR
analysis was performed as described previously
[45, 50]. The primer sequences used for the
amplification of genes were as follows: MDM2 sense:
5’-ATCATCGGACTCAGGTACA-3’; MDM2 antisense:
5’-GTCAGCTAAGGAAATTTCAGG-3’;
GAPDH
sense: 5’-GGAGTCCACTGGCGTCTTCAC-3’; GAPDH
antisense: 5’-GAGGCATTGCTGATGATCTTGAGG-3’.

Luciferase assay
Breast cancer cells were co-transfected with fulllength or deleted human MDM2 promoter vectors with
the Renilla luciferase reporter as an internal control [45,
49]. The cells were then exposed to JapA for 24 h. The
luciferase activity of the MDM2 promoter reporters was
determined using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay
System (Promega, Madison, WI), according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The MDM2 reporter activity was
normalized to that for the Renilla luciferase reporter.

Fluorescence polarization competitive binding
assay
Briefly, serial dilutions of JapA, a natural peptide
(residues 16-27, QETFSDLWKLLP-NH2) and the assay
buffer (100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5; 100 μg/
ml bovine gamma globulin; 0.02% sodium azide) with
preincubated MDM2 protein (10 nM, GST-MDM2) and
PMDM6-F peptide (1 nM) were added in Dynex 96well black, round-bottom plates, and the fluorescence
polarization values were measured after 3 h of incubation.
For each assay, the controls included the MDM2 protein
and PMDM6-F (equivalent to 0% inhibition) and only
PMDM6-F peptide (equivalent to 100% inhibition). The
binding affinity constants (Ki) of the test compound and
p53 peptide were calculated using a web-based computer
program (http://sw16.im.med.umich.edu/software/calc_
ki/) which was developed in Dr. Shaomeng Wang’s lab
[52-53].

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Immunoblotting
In the in vitro studies, the JapA-treated and control
cells were collected and lysed in NP40 lysis buffer
containing protease inhibitors (Sigma, St Louis, MO).
In vivo tissue homogenates were prepared in NP-40 lysis
buffer (100 mg tumor tissue/1 mL NP-40 buffer) for the
immunoblotting analysis. The protein concentration was
estimated using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA). Cell lysates with identical amounts of protein were
fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and were transferred to
Bio-Rad trans-Blot nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA) for immunoblotting as described previously
[45, 50].

the long diameter and “b” is the short diameter (cm). At
the end of the experiments, the xenograft tumors, lungs,
livers, kidneys, spleens and brains were removed from
the mice, weighed, and snap-frozen for Western blotting,
immunohistochemistry and hematoxylin and eosin
staining. The breast tumor metastases to lungs were also
counted.

MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were co-transfected
with MDM2 and ubiquitin plasmids, and treated with
various concentrations of JapA as indicated in the
figures. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antiMDM2 antibody, and the bound proteins were purified
with protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma, St Louis, MO),
resolved on SDS-PAGE, and detected by an anti-ubiquitin
antibody [45, 49].

Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and
immunohistochemistry

Immunofluorescence

The hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed
as described previously [55]. Briefly, freshly dissected
tissues were fixed and embedded in paraffin. After being
cut into 4-μm slices, the sections were deparaffinized
and stained in Mayer’s Hematoxylin and Eosin solution.
Finally, the sections were dehydrated and mounted with
Permount in a fume hood. The results were analyzed under
a phase-contrast Olympus microscope (Olympus America
Inc). For the immunohistochemical studies, the freshly
dissected tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin
for 24-48 h. The tissue block was embedded in paraffin
and cut to the desired thickness using a microtome, and
was affixed onto a slide. After several wash cycles, the
tumor sections were blocked and incubated with an antihuman MDM2 antibody (diluted 1:200 in 5% horse serum
in PBS) overnight at 4°C. Subsequently, sections were
incubated with pre-diluted streptavidin-peroxidase HRP
conjugates in a humidified chamber at room temperature
using a staining kit, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Dako North America, Inc., CA). The sections
were counterstained with hematoxylin for 2-3 minutes and
mounted and analyzed under a phase-contrast Olympus
microscope (Olympus America Inc).

MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded on
coverslips in a 12-well plate at a density of 10,000 cells/
well, allowed to attach overnight, and treated with JapA
(1 or 2 µM) for 24 h. The cells were fixed in a mixture of
acetone and methanol (1:1), blocked in goat serum, and
incubated with primary antibodies (anti-human MDM2
and β-actin antibodies) at 4°C overnight. Then, the cells
were washed with PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor
594 (anti-rabbit) and Alexa Fluor 488 (anti-mouse)
with gentle shaking for 1 h, followed by DAPI nuclear
counterstaining. The coverslips were mounted on slides
and photographed under a fluorescence microscope
(Olympus America Inc. Irving, TX) [54].

Xenograft models and treatment
The animal study protocols were approved by the
Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee of the
Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. Female
athymic pathogen-free nude mice (nu/nu, 4-6 weeks) were
purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington,
MA). To establish MCF-7 human breast cancer xenografts,
each of the female nude mice was first implanted with a
60-day subcutaneous (s.c.) slow release estrogen pellet
(SE-121, 1.7 mg 17β-estradiol/pellet; Innovative Research
of America, Sarasota, FL). The next day, cultured MCF-7
cells harvested from confluent monolayer cultures were
injected s.c. (5 × 106 cells, total volume 0.2 mL) into the
left inguinal area of the mice [45, 50]. For the MDAMB-231 xenograft model, we used the same procedure
as above, but without the estrogen pellet. All animals
were monitored for activity, physical condition, body
weight, and tumor growth. The mice bearing MCF-7
and MDA-MB-231 xenografts were randomly divided
into treatment and control groups (7-8 mice/group).
The control group received the vehicle only. JapA was
dissolved in PEG400:ethanol:saline (57.1:14.3:28.6,
v/v/v), and was administered by intraperitoneal (i.p.)
injection at doses of 15 or 30 mg/kg/d, 5 d/wk for 5 weeks
(MCF-7) or 3 weeks (MDA-MB-231). The tumor mass
(g) was calculated by the formula: (a×b2)/2, where “a” is

The data were analyzed using the Prism software
program version 6 (Graph Pad software Inc., San Diego,
CA, USA). Student’s t-test was used for comparisons
between two groups. The quantitative data are reported
as the means ± SEM from at least three independent
experiments. Differences were considered to be
statistically significant at P < 0.05. All statistical tests were
two-sided.
