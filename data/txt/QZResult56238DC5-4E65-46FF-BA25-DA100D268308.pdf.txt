to ER stress (3, 4). The UPR can be protective through activation of
adaptive, antiapoptotic pathways as well as commit cells to
apoptosis under severe stress. Cancer cells exhibit elevated glucose
metabolism and are often exposed to tumor hypoxia, resulting in
ER stress (5–7). Despite studies in xenograft models linking the
UPR to tumor growth, the precise role of the UPR in the
development of endogenous cancer remains unclear (5, 8–11).
The ER chaperone GRP78/BiP with antiapoptotic properties is a
central regulator of ER homeostasis, and its up-regulation is widely
used as a sentinel marker for ER stress under pathologic conditions
(7, 12–14). GRP78, also referred to as BiP [immunoglobulin (Ig)
heavy chain binding protein], is a member of the HSP70 protein
family that resides primarily in the ER (13–16). As a major ER
chaperone, it facilitates protein folding, preventing intermediates
from aggregating, and targeting misfolded protein for proteasome
degradation. GRP78 also binds Ca2+ and serves as an ER stress
signaling regulator (3, 12, 13).
GRP78 induction occurs during embryonic development and has
been widely reported in human cancer (17, 18). In cancer cell lines,
GRP78 promotes survival and chemoresistance in both proliferating and dormant tumor cells (16, 18, 19) and has also been
implicated in proliferation and invasion through activation of the
Akt and PAK2 pathways (20–22). Autoantibodies against GRP78 in
patient sera correlate with aggressive tumor behavior, and retrospective studies revealed that high-level GRP78 expression predicts
poor survival for cancer patients (7, 23). Given the importance of
GRP78 in cancer cell survival, it is a prime target for discovery of
anticancer agents. However, because GRP78 controls UPR signaling
that has both prosurvival and proapoptotic pathways, downregulation of GRP78 may result in premature activation of the UPR.
This raises the critical questions: Is this beneficial or harmful to
tumor progression, and how would this affect normal organs and
tissues?
To address this, we used the Grp78 heterozygous mouse model
where the basal level and ER stress induction of GRP78 has been
determined to be about half of wild-type (WT) level (24), thus
mimicking anti-GRP78 agents that achieve partial suppression of
GRP78 expression. In contrast to Grp78 homozygous knockout,
which results in lethality due to proliferative defect and massive
apoptosis of the inner cell mass of 3.5-day-old mouse embryos (24),
the Grp78+/ mice are viable and fertile. Thus, on breeding with a
transgenic mouse model of cancer, the Grp78 heterozygous mice
provide a unique opportunity to examine the physiologic role of
GRP78 in in situ–generated tumor progression compared with
normal organ development. Here, we report that reduction in
GRP78 level by about half in the Grp78 heterozygous mice has no
effect on organ development or antibody production but

Abstract
The unfolded protein response (UPR) is an evolutionarily
conserved mechanism that activates both proapoptotic and
survival pathways to allow eukaryotic cells to adapt to
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Although the UPR has
been implicated in tumorigenesis, its precise role in endogenous cancer remains unclear. A major UPR protective
response is the induction of the ER chaperone GRP78/BiP,
which is expressed at high levels in a variety of tumors and
confers drug resistance in both proliferating and dormant
cancer cells. To determine the physiologic role of GRP78 in
in situ–generated tumor and the consequence of its suppression on normal organs, we used a genetic model of breast
cancer in the Grp78 heterozygous mice where GRP78 expression level was reduced by about half, mimicking anti-GRP78
agents that achieve partial suppression of GRP78 expression.
Here, we report that Grp78 heterozygosity has no effect on
organ development or antibody production but prolongs the
latency period and significantly impedes tumor growth. Our
results reveal three major mechanisms mediated by GRP78 for
cancer progression: enhancement of tumor cell proliferation,
protection against apoptosis, and promotion of tumor angiogenesis. Importantly, although partial reduction of GRP78 in
the Grp78 heterozygous mice substantially reduces the tumor
microvessel density, it has no effect on vasculature of normal
organs. Our findings establish that a key UPR target GRP78
is preferably required for pathophysiologic conditions, such
as tumor proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis, underscoring its potential value as a novel therapeutic target for
dual antitumor and antiangiogenesis activity. [Cancer Res 2008;

Introduction
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an essential cellular organelle
where secretory and membrane proteins are synthesized and
modified and is also a major intracellular Ca2+ storage compartment. Recent discoveries further point to the ER as a novel focal
point for the regulation of apoptosis (1, 2). The unfolded protein
response (UPR) triggers multiple pathways to allow cells to respond

Role of GRP78 in Tumor Growth and Angiogenesis
20jC. Three washes with PBS were followed by permeabilization with
0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (v/v) for 10 min at room temperature and blocking
for 60 min at room temperature with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS
(w/v). The treated cells were incubated with the first primary antibody at
4jC overnight in a humidified chamber. After washing with PBS thrice, first
secondary antibody conjugated with fluorescein or Texas red was added
at a final concentration of 10 Ag/mL and incubated for 60 min at room
temperature. For immunofluorescent double staining, the cells were washed
with PBS thrice and the above staining procedure was repeated for the
second primary and second secondary antibodies, respectively. The stained
cells were mounted with aqueous mounting medium or ProLong Gold
antifade mounting medium with DAPI, the processed cells were visualized
using a Leica DM LB2 fluorescence microscope.
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end
labeling assay. In Situ Cell Death Detection kit, TMR red (Roche Applied
Science) was used and the sections of paraffin-embedded tumor were
stained following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The tumor
sections were mounted with ProLong gold antifade mounting medium with
DAPI. The apoptotic cells were visualized using a fluorescence microscope.
Microvessel density measurement. Frozen mouse tissues (tumor,
kidney, heart, and brain) were sectioned at 5 Am and fixed with acetone and
tissue sections were stained overnight with rat anti-mouse CD31 antibody
(BD PharMingen) followed by biotinylated anti-rat antibody (Vector
Laboratories) for 45 min as previously described (28). Tissues were then
treated with avidin-biotin peroxidase complex (Vector Laboratories) for
30 min and the aminoethyl carbazol substrate kit for 10 min (Vector
Laboratories). Counterstaining was performed with hematoxylin. The red
precipitate denotes positive staining. Isotype-matched serum was used in
place of the primary antibody for staining controls. Positive staining was
quantified using the imaging processing program ImageJ (NIH). Tumor
microvessel density (MVD) staining was analyzed in six mice, three from
each genotype, and the evaluation was performed on five random fields per
tumor. Organ MVD staining was analyzed in a pair of Grp78 WT and
heterozygous mice from the same group, with five random fields examined
per tissue.
Western blots. Pieces of tumors dissected from mice were homogenized
with a Dounce homogenizer in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer
[50 mmol/L Tris (pH 8), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% deoxycholate,
0.1% SDS, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitors] to lyse cells followed by
centrifugation at 14,000  g at 4jC for 10 min. The supernatant obtained
from each sample was subjected to immunoblot. Protocols for Western blot
analysis have been described (16). The primary antibodies used were the
following: rabbit anti-GRP78 (1:1,000), rat anti-polyoma virus early antigens
(1:1,000), mouse anti-CHOP (1:1,000), rabbit anti-ATF6 (1:1,000), and rabbit
anti-ATF4 (1:1,000) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; mouse anti-h-actin
(1:5,000) from Sigma-Aldrich; mouse anti-caspase-7 (1:4,000) from BD PharMingen; and rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3 (1:1,000) and anti-phosphorylated
eIF2a and rabbit anti-eIF2a (1:1,000) from Cell Signaling. The experiments
were repeated two to three times.
Xbp-1 splicing measurement. Total RNA from tumor samples was
isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and first-strand cDNA was
synthesized with SuperScript II (Invitrogen). To detect both spliced and
unspliced forms of Xbp-1, nested PCR was performed. The primers used for
first-round PCR were as follows: 5¶-TAGAAAGAAAGCCCGGATGA ( forward)
and 5¶-AAAGGGAGGCTGGTAAGGAA (reverse). PCR primers for the second
round were as follows: 5¶-GAACCAGGAGTTAAGAACACG ( forward) and
5¶-AGGCAACAGTGTCAGAGTCC (reverse).
Statistical analysis. The tumor volumes of the Grp78 WT and
heterozygous mice were compared using the random coefficient model
where the intercept and the slope for each mouse were treated as random.
A quadratic time term was included in the model because of the curvature
of the growth pattern. The group  time interaction was tested using the
likelihood ratio test, which will indicate whether the growth pattern was
significantly different between the two groups. The growth rates of multiple
primary tumor cell lines derived from Grp78 WT and heterozygous mice
were monitored in two experiments. Before analysis, the cell numbers were
normalized so that all cell lines started at the same level with the number of

significantly impedes tumor progression through multiple mechanisms. Our findings provide direct evidence that a major protective arm of the UPR, GRP78/BiP, is critical for tumor proliferation,
survival, and angiogenesis, underscoring its value as a novel therapeutic target for dual antitumor and antiangiogenesis activity.

Materials and Methods
Generation of mammary tumors in genetically altered Grp78 mice
and monitoring of tumor growth. The generation of the Grp78+/ mice
has been described (24). Female Grp78+/ mice were mated with male
MMTVPyVT heterozygous transgenic mice (25). The progenies were
genotyped by PCR of tail DNA and monitored for tumor growth and
incidence. The experiment on tumor growth was done in two phases. Seven
Grp78+/+,PyT mice and six Grp78+/ ,PyT mice were used in the initial
phase. Starting 8 weeks of age, mammary tumors were detected. The
primary tumor diameters were measured with a caliper weekly. The second
phase was a replication of the first one, with two modifications: (a) the
sample size in phase 2 was 15 mice in each group, and (b) both the width
and the length of the tumor were measured in phase 2. Tumor volume was
calculated using the following equation: volume = width2  length  0.5.
Following sacrifice at the end of the experiment, organs and tumors were
harvested for analysis. All animal protocols were conducted with the
approval of the University of Southern California Animal Care and Use
Committee. The numbers of mice with tumor at each week from both
phases are shown in Fig. 2A and the tumor growth curves in the second
phase are shown in Fig. 2B.
Immunization and determination of Ig titers. Six- to 8-week-old
Grp78+/ and littermate Grp78+/+ mice were immunized by i.p. injections
of 100 Ag trinitrophenyl-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (TNP-KLH; Biosearch
Technologies) in Imject alum (Pierce). TNP-KLH–immunized mice were
given a booster 21 days later. Serum samples were collected before
immunization and on day 7 after TNP-KLH reimmunization. Basal Ig levels
in sera were quantified using Beadlyte mouse Ig isotyping kit (Millipore)
following the manufacturer’s protocol. To measure relative TNP-specific
antibody levels, the same isotyping kit combined with Beadlyte biotinconjugated TNP ovalbumin (Millipore) and Beadlyte streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Millipore) was used following the manufacturer’s protocol.
Derivation of cell culture from tumor tissues. Primary culture of
tumor cells was established as described (26). Briefly, tumor tissues were cut
into fine pieces and seeded onto 6-cm-diameter culture dishes and cultured
at 37jC with 5% CO2 in 1 mL of high-glucose DMEM containing 4.5 mg/mL
glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol/L glutamine,
and 1% penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin antibiotics. After overnight
culturing, an additional 2 mL medium was added. After 5 days, the tumor
tissues were removed from the culture dish, and the attached cells were
allowed to grow. After expansion, the cells were seeded for immunohistochemical staining and growth rate measurements. For growth measurements, the cells were stained with trypan blue and counted every 2 days
until day 9.
Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent staining. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on paraffin-embedded tumor
sections (4 Am) or cell culture in a chamber slide (Nalge Nunc
International). Vectastain Elite avidin-biotin complex kit (Vector Laboratories) was used for immunohistochemistry, and fluorescein or Texas red
conjugated anti-rabbit or mouse IgG (H+L; Vector Laboratories) for
immunofluorescent staining. Primary antibodies against Pan-cytokeratin
(rabbit, 1:50), GRP78 (rabbit, 1:100), CHOP (mouse, 1:200) and proliferating
cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; mouse, 1:50) were from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. Antibody against human vimentin (mouse, 1:100) was from
Chemicon International. ProLong Gold antifade mounting medium with
4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Invitrogen) and aqueous mounting
medium were from Vector Laboratories.
Immunohistochemical staining was carried out as described previously
(27). Immunofluorescent staining of cultured cells was performed on cells
plated in a chamber slide. The cells were fixed with methanol for 30 min at

cells being 2  104 and log transformed. ANOVA was performed to compare
the cell numbers on day 9 between the cell lines from Grp78 WT and
heterozygous tumors after adjusting for the experiment. The MVD in
tumors and organs of heterozygous mice was also compared with that of
WT mice using ANOVA after log transforming the data. The means and
95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated on the log-transformed
data and then transformed back to the original scale.

mammary tumors. In the Grp78+/+,PyT mice, most tumors were
first detectable between week 8 and 10, whereas most tumors in
the Grp78+/ ,PyT mice became detectable between week 10 and
12 (Fig. 2A). Thus, the latency period was delayed for f2 weeks
in the heterozygous Grp78 mice. As expected, neither the Grp78
WT nor heterozygous mice without the PyT allele developed
any tumor (Fig. 2A). The growth of the primary tumors in mice
bearing the PyT oncogene was monitored for 15 weeks.
Statistical analysis indicated that the tumor growth was significantly reduced in the Grp78+/ ,PyT mice compared with the
Grp78+/+,PyT mice (P < 0.001; Fig. 2B), with the mean tumor
volume at week 15 reduced from 201 mm3 for Grp78+/+ mice to
92 mm3 for Grp78+/ mice, a reduction of 109 mm3 (95% CI,
60–159 mm3). Therefore, partial reduction of a single UPR target,
GRP78, is sufficient to impede tumor growth and reduce tumor
size by 60%. In this mammary tumor model, which is noted for
its high penetrance, the mice also developed smaller tumors in
subsequent weeks. The size and number of these tumors were
also reduced in the Grp78 heterozygous mice (data not shown).
In contrast, the size and morphology of major organs in all four
groups of mice (Grp78+/+,PyT, Grp78+/ ,PyT, Grp78+/+, and
Grp78+/ ) were comparable (Fig. 2C). The organ weights of
the Grp78+/+ and Grp78+/ mice were also similar (Fig. 2D).
Thus, Grp78 heterozygosity preferably affects tumor growth.
Grp78 heterozygosity inhibits tumor proliferation and
promotes apoptosis. Toward understanding the mechanisms
that contribute to the slower growth rate of tumors of the
Grp78+/ ,PyT mice, tumor sections were analyzed. H&E staining of
paraffin-embedded tumor sections revealed that whereas
Grp78+/+,PyT tumors exhibited well-vascularized sheets of polygonal and cohesive tumor cells, the Grp78+/ ,PyT tumors showed
more discohesive tumor cells admixed with dense stromal

Results
Grp78 heterozygous mice exhibit normal growth, organ
development, and antibody production. Both male and female
Grp78+/ mice grew at the same rate as their WT siblings (Fig. 1A)
and the size, morphology, and histology of their major organs were
comparable with those of WT (Fig. 1B; data not shown). As the
Ig binding protein, GRP78 is highly abundant in plasma cells where
it stabilizes Ig chains and facilitates their assembly (13). Analysis
of preimmune serum IgM and various subclasses of IgG antibody
levels yielded no significant difference between the WT and heterozygous mice (Fig. 1C). After immunization with the antigen
TNP-KLH, the relative serum levels of IgG1 and IgG2b specific to
TNP remained similar (Fig. 1D). Thus, about half of WT GRP78
level is sufficient to sustain normal growth and development and
seems to have no major effect on Ig production under either preimmune or acute immunization conditions.
Grp78 heterozygosity prolongs the latency period and
impedes mammary tumor growth. To determine the role of
GRP78 on endogenous tumor growth, the Grp78+/ mice were
crossed with the transgenic mice (MMTVPyVT) expressing the
polyoma middle T oncogene (PyT) driven by the murine mammary tumor viral promoter (25). Cohorts of Grp78+/+,PyT mice,
Grp78+/ ,PyT mice, Grp78+/+ mice, and Grp78+/ mice were
monitored for the time of appearance and size of the primary

Role of GRP78 in Tumor Growth and Angiogenesis

there were very few apoptotic tumor cells; in contrast, tumor cells
from the Grp78 heterozygous mice showed enhanced apoptosis in
general (Fig. 3D, top). Further, in some regions of the Grp78+/ ,PyT
tumors, strong immunohistochemical staining of CHOP was
observed, indicative of ER stress–induced apoptosis (Fig. 3D,
bottom).
Tumor cells derived from the Grp78+/ ,PyT mice grow
slower in vitro. Primary tumor cells from the Grp78 WT and
heterozygous mice were propagated in vitro. This allows us to
examine whether decreased proliferation of the Grp78+/ ,PyT
tumor cells is an intrinsic property of the epithelial tumor cells
with reduced GRP78 expression or due to alterations in the tumor
microenvironment in the Grp78 heterozygous mice. Direct
comparison of the proliferative rates of the cells in culture will
eliminate the extrinsic factors such as tumor hypoxia and
angiogenesis. The decrease in proliferation of tumor cells from
the Grp78+/ ,PyT group was evident from substantially lower
PCNA labeling compared with the Grp78+/+,PyT group (Fig. 4A,
top). The identity of the epithelial tumor cells in each group was
further confirmed by costaining with fluorescent anti-keratin
antibody (Fig. 4B, bottom). To confirm the staining results,
the growth rates of multiple primary cell lines derived from
Grp78+/+,PyT and Grp78+/ ,PyT tumors were directly monitored
(Fig. 4B). The growth rates began to diverge after 5 days of culture.
By 9 days of culture, the mean number of tumor cells was
significantly decreased from 8.9  104 for the Grp78+/+,PyT group
to 6.3  104 for the Grp78+/ ,PyT group, a 29% reduction (P =
0.048). Thus, the reduction in proliferation rate is an intrinsic
property of the tumor cells of the heterozygous group rather than a
consequence of the tumor microenvironment.
Grp78 heterozygosity up-regulates CHOP and caspases in
tumors. The detection by immunohistochemistry that CHOP was
induced in some areas of the tumor from the Grp78 heterozygous
mice indicates that those tumor cells were unable to adapt to ER
stress. As an ER stress–inducible transcription factor, CHOP has
been reported to induce apoptotic cell death by promoting protein
synthesis and oxidation in the stressed ER (29). To extend these
observations, Western blot analysis was performed on cell lysates
of tumors from the Grp78 WT and heterozygous mice. Tumors of
different sizes were examined, and in general, tumors from the
Grp78 heterozygous mice showed lower level of GRP78, confirming
results obtained from immunohistochemical staining of tumor
sections (Fig. 5A and B). The level of the polyoma middle T antigen
(PyT) was similar or slightly higher in the Grp78+/ ,PyT tumors
(Fig. 5A), ruling out the possibility that decreased GRP78 may
negatively affect PyT production. CHOP induction was observed in
Grp78+/ ,PyT tumors, which expressed the lowest level of GRP78
(Fig. 5C). GRP78 is known to bind procaspase-7 (C-7) and block its
activation (16, 30, 31). Grp78+/ ,PyT tumors of all sizes showed C-7
activation, as evidenced by C-7 cleavage, with strongest activation
in tumors expressing the lowest GRP78 level (Fig. 5C). Interestingly,
strong activation of C-7 was also observed in large Grp78+/+,PyT
tumors. Caspase-3 activation, as evidenced by cleavage products,
was generally observed in Grp78+/ ,PyT tumors and in large
Grp78+/+,PyT tumors (Fig. 5C). The large tumors, in general,
displayed necrotic regions, which were not observed in medium- or
small-sized tumors (data not shown).
Next, we addressed the issue whether reduction of GRP78 level
by about half in tumors from the Grp78 heterozygous mice alters
the UPR signaling pathways, as GRP78 regulates their activation
(3, 4, 13). ATF6 activation is examined by detection of its cleavage

component (Fig. 3A). The epithelial origin of the tumor cells was
confirmed by the demonstration of positive immunofluorescence
staining with anti-keratin antibody (depicted by cytosolic green
staining) in these cells, whereas immunofluorescence positivity for
vimentin, a mesenchymal cell marker, was confined to fibroblasts
(depicted by cytosolic red staining), which were more prevalent in
the Grp78+/ ,PyT tumors (Fig. 3B).
Sections of tumors from the Grp78 WT and heterozygous mice
were further subjected to PCNA staining to determine whether
Grp78 heterozygosity affects tumor proliferation. Strikingly, cell
proliferation was substantially reduced in the Grp78+/ ,PyT
tumors that expressed lower levels of GRP78, as revealed by
immunohistochemical staining (Fig. 3C). The antiapoptotic property of GRP78 predicts that lower GRP78 expression level in the
Grp78+/ ,PyT tumors could result in enhanced apoptosis. To test
this, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick
end labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed. In Grp78 WT tumors,

Discussion

products in Western blot analysis. Compared with the positive
control where the cells were treated with the classic ER stress
inducer thapsigargin, ATF6 activation in both sets of tumors was
negligible, albeit a slightly higher level in the Grp78+/ ,PyT tumors
in general (Fig. 5C). Due to technical difficulty, we were unable to
assay directly for PERK or IRE activation in the tumor samples;
however, we were able to monitor for activation of their
downstream targets. Interestingly, phosphorylated eIF2a, a downstream target of PERK, was detected in Grp78+/+,PyT but not
Grp78+/ ,PyT tumors. The level of ATF4, another PERK target, was
either not affected or slightly lower in the Grp78+/ ,PyT tumors
(Fig. 5C). Activation of the IRE1 pathway leads to Xbp-1 splicing.
In tumors from the Grp78 WT or heterozygous mice, the level of
Xbp-1 transcript was the same and no splicing was detected
(Fig. 5D). Thus, although it remains possible that these pathways
were affected earlier during tumor development, our results
suggest that the phenotypes observed in the Grp78+/ ,PyT tumors
are independent of sustained activation of these UPR pathways.
Grp78 heterozygosity inhibits tumor angiogenesis. Another
mechanism that may contribute to the slower growth of the
Grp78+/ ,PyT tumors is that GRP78 is required for tumor angiogenesis. To test this, tumor sections from the Grp78 WT and
heterozygous mice were analyzed for MVD through staining with
the antibody to the endothelial cell marker anti-CD31. In contrast
to the well-vascularized Grp78+/+,PyT tumors, Grp78+/ ,PyT
tumors showed a dramatic reduction in MVD (Fig. 6A). Quantitation of the stained tumor vasculature revealed a decrease in the
MVD from 9.1 Am2 per field for the Grp78+/+,PyT tumors to
2.7 Am2 for the Grp78+/ ,PyT tumors, a 70% reduction (95% CI,
46–83%; P = 0.038; Fig. 6B). In contrast, the vasculature in organs
and tissues from the same mice, including brain, heart, and kidney,
was not affected (Fig. 6C; data not shown). These results reveal that
GRP78 is preferably required for tumor angiogenesis.

The emerging importance of the stress response and molecular
chaperones in oncogenesis is well recognized (15, 18, 32).
Compared with normal tissue, tumor cells are subject to ER stress
due to elevated glycolytic activity and, in fasting growing solid
tumors, inadequate blood vessel, creating a microenvironment of
glucose deprivation, acidosis, and hypoxia. These combined factors
lead to ER stress and the trigger of UPR adaptive responses. Recent
studies using xenograft models suggest that UPR pathways may
play an important role for tumor survival and angiogenesis under
hypoxic conditions, conferring growth advantage to the tumor
cells (5, 8, 9, 33). However, the UPR could also exert opposing
effects (11, 34). Therefore, it is important to examine the role of
UPR in the context of endogenous tumor development, which more
closely mimics human cancer.
A prominent UPR protective response is the transcriptional
activation of the ER stress chaperone GRP78, which is known to
confer resistance to a variety of cancer therapy in both proliferating
and dormant cancer cells in culture (7, 16, 18, 19, 22, 35). A prerequisite toward understanding the physiologic role of GRP78 in
endogenous cancer requires a model organism with altered GRP78
expression. The creation of novel mouse strains with genetic
disruption of the Grp78 allele affords this opportunity (24). In this
report, using a genetic model of breast cancer in the Grp78 heterozygous mice, we provide direct evidence that partial suppression
of GRP78 level delays the latency period and significantly inhibits
in situ–generated tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis. In contrast, partial GRP78 level is sufficient for organ development and
cellular immunity.
These observations raise several important issues. How might
GRP78 confer growth advantage to the tumor cells? Our results
reveal three major mechanisms mediated by GRP78: enhancement
of tumor cell proliferation, protection against apoptosis, and

Role of GRP78 in Tumor Growth and Angiogenesis

Tumor angiogenesis plays a critical role in tumor growth and is
a key target for anticancer therapy (39, 40). Interestingly, the tumor
vasculature is physiologically and functionally distinct from blood
vessels in normal organs (28, 41). In contrast to normal endothelial
cells, primary tumor endothelial cells proliferate more slowly and
are much more resistant to cytotoxic drugs. Proteomics of human
endothelial cells suggests that GRP78 inhibits endothelial cell
apoptosis induced by topoisomerase inhibitors (42). Thus, it is
possible that the antiapoptotic properties of GRP78 protect tumor
as well as tumor-associated endothelial cells against stress in
the tumor microenvironment. Further, as an ER chaperone,
GRP78 may be critical for processing client proteins essential for
tumor vasculature formation. Cell surface GRP78 expression in

Figure 4. In vitro proliferation and growth rate measurement of tumor cells

Grp78 WT and heterozygous mice cultured in vitro for 9 d were subjected
to PCNA staining and immunofluorescent double staining with PCNA and
anti-keratin antibody. Top, tumor cells from the Grp78 heterozygous mice
showed lower PCNA labeling (brown ); bottom, immunofluorescent double
staining confirmed that the cultured cells were cytokeratin-positive epithelial
tumor cells (green ) and fewer tumor cells from the Grp78 heterozygous mice
showed PCNA labeling (red). B, tumor cells derived from the Grp78 WT and
heterozygous mice (n = 7 for each genotype) were cultured in vitro. The
geometric mean cell number was plotted against time of culture. The 95% CI
for the mean cell number on day 9 is (6.9–11.5)  104 for the Grp78+/+,PyT
cell lines and (4.9–8.1)  104 for the Grp78+/ ,PyT cell lines. ANOVA
showed that the Grp78+/ ,PyT cell lines have a significantly lower number of
cells on day 9 (P = 0.048).

promotion of tumor angiogenesis. With regard to cell proliferation,
as a major ER chaperone, GRP78 may facilitate the processing and
trafficking of critical growth factors and their receptors (36).
Moreover, GRP78 can be detected on the surface of tumor cells
(21, 30, 37). As part of a cell surface receptor complex, it is proposed
that GRP78 mediates the Akt signal transduction pathway that
induces tumor cell proliferation (21). Our results with the Grp78
heterozygous mice validate a novel role of GRP78 in tumor cell
proliferation. With regard to apoptosis, we show that, in tumors
where GRP78 expression level is reduced, there is specific induction
of CHOP and activation of executive caspase-3 and caspase-7. In
tissue culture systems, GRP78 has been shown to suppress CHOP
induction and ER stress–induced apoptosis and that GRP78 is an
interactive partner of caspase-7 and blocks its activation under
stress (16, 22, 30, 31, 38).

new anticancer approach (10). Our findings with the Grp78
heterozygous mice validate the earlier results and further establish
GRP78 as a novel therapeutic target for dual suppression of tumor
growth and angiogenesis. Down-regulation of GRP78, therefore,
may become an important adjunct in future cancer treatment.
Recent developments of small molecules that can block GRP78
and/or its activity may make this approach clinically feasible in the
near future (7). For example, a microbial compound, versipelostatin, which inhibits induction of GRP78 under glucose starvation
conditions and disrupts some components of the UPR, selectively
kills glucose-deprived cancer cells and acts synergistically with
cisplatin in inhibiting tumor growth in xenografts (48). Recently, it
was shown that ( )-epigallocatechin gallate, an active component
from green tea, directly interacts with the ATP-binding domain of
GRP78, blocking its interaction with C-7, thereby inhibiting its
antiapoptotic function and sensitizing cancer cells to chemotherapy (31). Another agent currently in clinical trials is recombinant
human plasminogen Kringle 5 (ABT 828). Preclinical studies
revealed that GRP78 is the receptor for Kringle 5, which induces
apoptosis of both fibrosarcoma and growth-stimulated endothelial

endothelial cells could also mediate their proliferation. In support
of a potential role of GRP78 in angiogenesis, expression of
angiogenic factors (vascular endothelial growth factor and
interleukin-8) is highly responsive to ambient glutamine deprivation, which induces GRP78 (43). Although the precise mechanisms
on the reduction in tumor MVD in the tumors of the Grp78
heterozygous mice await future investigations, it could be due to
combinative effects of deficient angiogenic factor production,
reduced proliferation, and enhanced apoptosis. Our discovery that
GRP78 is preferably required for the maintenance of the tumor
vasculature supports the notion that GRP78 function is most
critical under pathophysiologic conditions in adult animals.
On the translational front, stress chaperones represent exciting
therapeutic targets for cancer based on their multiple and essential
roles in tumor growth (44). Recent retrospective studies reveal that
high GRP78 expression level in cancer biopsies is closely associated
with poor prognosis and resistance to therapy (18, 45–47). Earlier
xenograft studies showed that down-regulation of GRP78 by
antisense inhibits xenograft formation and tumor growth, providing the first hint that suppressing GRP78 expression is a promising

cells (30). It is proposed that, following internalization, Kringle 5
blocks intracellular GRP78 binding to C-7, suppressing its antiapoptotic function. With GRP78 playing critical roles in tumor
proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, and drug resistance of both
proliferating and dormant cancer cells, as well as tumor-associated
endothelial cells (7, 18, 19, 32), combination of drugs capable of
GRP78 suppression with conventional therapy may represent a
novel approach toward eradication of residual tumor, which
remains a major challenge in cancer therapy.
