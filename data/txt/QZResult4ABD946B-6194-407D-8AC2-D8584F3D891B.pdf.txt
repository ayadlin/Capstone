Treatment of Epidural Spinal Cord
Involvement From Germ Cell Tumors
With Chemotherapy
Christian Grommes, MD1; George J. Bosl, MD2; and Lisa M. DeAngelis, MD1

BACKGROUND: Germ cell tumors (GCTs) are chemosensitive, and epidural spinal cord compression (ESCC) from
GCT may be amenable to treatment with chemotherapy (CT) only. This retrospective study compares the clinical outcome of GCT patients with ESCC treated with CT or radiotherapy (RT) þ CT. METHODS: All patients with a histologic
diagnosis of GCT from 1984 to 2009 were included in this study. Patients with ESCC were identified. Age, clinical features, histology, treatment, and outcome were analyzed. RESULTS: The authors identified 1734 patients with GCT, of
whom 29 (1.7%) had ESCC. The median age of these 29 patients was 32 years. The ESCC was treated with CT only in
16, RT þ CT in 11, and 2 patients received palliative care only. The ESCC was more extensive in the RT þ CT than the
CT group. Patients who received RT þ CT had a higher proportion of failed prior CT regimens, a higher percentage of
nonseminomatous GCT, T-spine involvement, multilevel epidural disease, and bony vertebral metastases. Median overall survival after diagnosis of ESCC was not reached for those treated with CT alone versus 15 months for those
receiving RT þ CT (P ¼ .02). There was also a significant difference in survival in patients receiving first-line therapy
(n ¼ 15), where median overall survival was not reached in the CT group (n ¼ 11), compared with 22 months in the RT
group (n ¼ 4) (P ¼ .04). CONCLUSIONS: GCTs rarely involve the epidural compartment. Patients with ESCC who are
C 2010
likely to have chemosensitive disease can receive CT alone as definitive treatment. Cancer 2011;117:1911–6. V

Germ cell tumors (GCTs) are uncommon, accounting for only 1% to 2% of all malignancies in men, but are the most
frequent malignancy in men between the ages of 15 and 35 years.1,2 Vertebral bone metastasis, spinal cord compression,
or even spinal cord involvement by GCT is rare and only described in case reports for seminomas3-9 and nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCTs).10-14 In most other solid tumors, epidural spinal cord compression (ESCC) is treated
with high-dose corticosteroids with radiation therapy (RT) or surgical decompression. However, ESCC from GCT may
be treated effectively by chemotherapy (CT) only.15 The aim of this retrospective analysis is to describe a cohort of patients
with ESCC from GCT and to compare survival and neurologic outcome after treating these patients with CT alone in
comparison with RT followed by CT (RT þ CT).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center clinical database was used to identify patients with a histologic diagnosis of
GCT (search terms: seminoma, NOS; seminoma-metastatic NOS; seminoma, anaplastic type; seminoma-anaplastic,
meta; spermatocytic seminoma; germ cell tumor, nonseminomatous; mixed germ cell tumor; teratoma; choriocarcinoma;
choriocarcinoma-met) from 1984 to 2009. Patients treated before 1984 with CT alone were already described in an earlier
publication and not included in this study.15 Patients with ESCC were identified by the International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Edition code. Age, race/ethnicity, clinical features, histology, treatment, and outcome were analyzed.

The White spinal metastatic cancer grade16 (I, ambulatory; II, nonambulatory but some motor function;
III, paraplegia with no motor function) and the Constans
spinal metastases classification17 (I, pain or minor neurological symptoms with normal social and professional
activities; II, mild neurological symptoms with normal
life but interruption of professional activities; III, moderate neurological symptoms like paraparesis, sphincter disturbances, columnar pain with active life possible; IV,
serious neurological symptoms like paraplegia and complete sphincter deficit; V, medullary syndrome of spinal
cord transection) were used to quantify ESCC-related
clinical deficits retrospectively. These grades were assigned
based on the treating neurologist’s examination done at
ESCC diagnosis and during the patient’s treatment. The
diagnostic spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
was reviewed for all patients for whom films were available, and the degree of ESCC was rated on a scale from 0
to 3, based on axial T2-weighted magnetic resonance
images; this scale assesses the degree of subarachnoid space
obliteration and ESCC and has been used previously.18
Fisher exact test was used to calculate significant levels for tumor type, ESCC location and severity on MRI,
vertebral versus bone metastases, multilevel disease, prior
failed CT, clinical grading scale, and improvement of
ESCC on MRI after treatment. Survival was estimated
using the Kaplan-Meier method and was compared
between patients receiving CT alone versus RT þ CT
using the log-rank test. This study was approved by the
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Institutional
Review Board.

RESULTS
We identified 1734 patients with GCT who met study
criteria. In the course of their disease, 393 (23%) patients
developed lung metastases, 109 (6%) mediastinal metastases, 147 (8%) gastrointestinal metastases, 83 (5%) bone
metastases, and 29 (1.7%) ESCC, of whom 13 had ESCC

at presentation. The median age of these 29 patients was
32 years (range, 14-59 years) (Table 1). Ten patients had
a seminoma and 19 a NSGCT. The ESCC was treated
with CT in 16 patients, 11 received RT þ CT, and 2
patients received palliation only (Table 1). Of the 27
patients who received active treatment for ESCC, films
were available for review in 23 patients, and imaging
reports confirmed ESCC in the remaining 4. Four had
ESCC located in the cervical spine, 14 in the thoracic
spine, and 9 in the lumbar spine. In 5 of the 27 patients,
additional multilevel epidural disease without ESCC was
also present (Table 2). Seventy-six percent of patients had
severe ESCC (grade 2-3), 41% had vertebral metastases,
and 44% had a paravertebral mass invading the neuroforamen causing ESCC (Table 3).
Of the patients receiving active treatment, 17 (8
with NSGCT) had no prior CT, 5 (4 with NSGCT) had

1-2 prior CT regimens, and 5 (all NSGCT) had >3 prior
regimens. Of the 17 patients with no prior CT, 13 had
ESCC at presentation, 2 had prior RT to the hemipelvis,
1 had orchiectomy only, and 1 denied prior treatment.
Patients without ESCC at presentation developed ESCC
a median of 86.5 months after initial diagnosis in the CT
group compared with a median of 36 months in the RT
þ CT group (P ¼ .8).
Patients who received RT þ CT had a higher proportion of failed CT regimens (36% vs 6%; P ¼ .13),
which is likely related to the higher percentage of NSGCT
(73% vs 56%; P ¼ .4); T-spine involvement (74% vs

clinical presentation to those who received RT þ CT with
respect to back pain, ambulation, motor deficits, and

incontinence, but they had fewer sensory deficits and
reflex abnormalities (Table 2). The White spinal metastatic cancer grade had a comparable distribution in both
groups, whereas the Constans spinal metastases classification had more patients with severe grades (III, IV) in the
CT group (38% vs 27%; P ¼ .69) (Table 3). The degree
of ESCC was similar in the CT and RT þ CT groups
(grade 3: 31% vs 45%; P ¼ .69). In the CT group, 56%
of the ESCCs were caused by a paravertebral mass and
neuroforaminal infiltration, whereas in the RT þ CT
group, 55% were caused by bony vertebral metastasis (Table 3).
Back pain and ambulation improved in all patients
after treatment (Table 4). Incontinence improved in all 3
patients receiving CT alone, whereas neither of the RT þ
CT patients with incontinence recovered. ESCC on MRI
improved in 69% of patients receiving CT, compared
with 36% in the RT þ CT group (P ¼ .13), but pretreatment or follow-up imaging was not available for review in
55% of patients receiving RT þ CT, compared with 19%
in the CT group (Table 3).
In the CT alone group, 14 patients (88%) received a
platinum-based CT regimen for their ESCC with bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) being the most
commonly used regimen in 9 (56%) patients (Table 5). In
the RT þ CT group, 8 patients received platinum-based
therapy, only 2 of whom received BEP and 1 patient each
received paclitaxel þ ifosfamide, temozolomide, and
sunitinib (9% each) after RT (Table 5). Eight patients in
the RT þ CT group had received CT for their GCT
before ESCC development, all of whom received platinum-based CT (5 of 8 received BEP [63%]). Fifteen
patients received first-line CT for their ESCC, of whom
11 received CT alone and 4 received RT þ CT; all

DISCUSSION
Early detection and aggressive treatment of ESCC are
essential for a good neurologic outcome. More than
20,000 new patients per year develop ESCC in the United
States.19 Treatment objectives are preservation and
improvement of neurologic function, pain relief, and
maintenance of spinal stability. The treatment of ESCC is
often palliative and includes high-dose glucocorticoids,
surgical decompression, and RT. A recent randomized
trial of ESCC from solid tumors demonstrated a superior
outcome with surgical resection followed by RT versus

RT alone; however, there were no patients with GCT
included in that study.20
ESCC is rare in patients with GCT; in 1 study of
140 GCT patients, none had ESCC.21 Furthermore,
there are no specific data addressing therapy of ESCC in
this population. In chemosensitive malignancies, such as
GCT, lymphoma, neuroblastoma, or Ewing sarcoma, CT
could be considered the primary treatment modality for
ESCC, providing the expected response would be sufficiently robust as to relieve compression on the spinal cord
rapidly.22 CT also treats all sites of active disease, sparing
patients a delay in systemic treatment and the myelotoxicity of spinal RT. Our patient cohort represents the largest
group with ESCC caused by GCT described so far in the
literature, and supports the use of CT as primary treatment for ESCC in these patients.
The first report that cisplatin-based CT could treat
ESCC from GCT described 3 patients from Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.15 Our current series did
not include these patients, as they were treated before the
MRI era. We sought to expand this experience during the
period of enhanced diagnostics with spine MRI. In our 27
patients, we could demonstrate the effectiveness of CT in
the management of GCT with epidural involvement.
Patients receiving CT alone recovered their neurologic
function, even when there was a high degree of ESCC
associated with significant neurologic deficits. These data
indicate that CT worked sufficiently quickly that spinal
cord compression was relieved promptly and no neurologic deterioration occurred during treatment. In our
patient population, RT þ CT was used in patients with
multilevel epidural disease who were also more heavily
pretreated. These patients had more chemoresistant disease and developed ESCC later in the course of their
malignancy, so it is unsurprising that patients receiving
CT alone had a survival advantage after the diagnosis of
ESCC. However, patients who received CT alone as first
therapy as well as those who had received 2 chemotherapeutic regimens before the development of ESCC had
longer survival than comparable patients treated with RT
þ CT; this reached statistical significance only in the firstline therapy patients, likely because of the small patient
numbers. These patients predictably responded to CT
alone for their ESCC, and definitive systemic therapy was
not delayed for spinal RT, which could have compromised overall outcome in patients receiving combined
therapy.
There are several limitations to our study, including
the small patient number, its retrospective nature, and in-

herent patient selection bias. However, the critical message is clear: patients receiving first-line CT or first or
second platinum-based salvage regimens have excellent
relief of neurologic symptoms and superior survival when
treated with CT alone. This recommendation is based on
our limited retrospective data, but a prospective study is
unlikely given the rarity of ESCC in GCT. On the basis
of these results, CT alone should be the treatment of
choice in newly diagnosed GCT patients who present
with ESCC and GCT patients who have received no more
than 2 prior regimens if the disease was previously chemosensitive. Clinical judgment is needed in patients who
have received more than 2 prior CT regimens, particularly
if they have progressed after high-dose CT. In these cases,
ESCC is most likely to represent chemoresistant disease,
and RT þ CT may be the more appropriate therapy.
