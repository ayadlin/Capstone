ABSTRACT
Our neoadjuvant clinical trial of a GM-CSF secreting allogeneic pancreas tumor
vaccine (GVAX) revealed the development of tertiary lymphoid aggregates (TLAs)
within the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) tumor microenvironment 2
weeks after GVAX treatment. Microarray studies revealed that multiple components
of the TGF-β pathway were suppressed in TLAs from patients who survived greater
than 3 years and who demonstrated vaccine-enhanced mesothelin-specific T cell
responses. We tested the hypothesis that combining GVAX with TGF-β inhibitors
will improve the anti-tumor immune response of vaccine therapy. In a metastatic
murine model of pancreatic cancer, combination therapy with GVAX vaccine and
a TGF-β blocking antibody improved the cure rate of PDA-bearing mice. TGF-β
blockade in combination with GVAX significantly increased the infiltration of effector
CD8+ T lymphocytes, specifically anti-tumor-specific IFN-g producing CD8+ T cells,
when compared to monotherapy controls (all p < 0.05). TGF-β blockade alone did
not deplete T regulatory cells (Tregs), but when give in combination with GVAX,
GVAX induced intratumoral Tregs were depleted. Therefore, our PDA preclinical
model demonstrates a survival advantage in mice treated with an anti-TGF-β
antibody combined with GVAX therapy and provides strong rational for testing this
combinational therapy in clinical trials.

macrophages (TAMs), myeloid derived suppressive cells
(MDSCs), and regulatory T cells (Tregs) [1]. Additionally,
antigen experienced effector T cells (Teffs) are scarce [2].
While a number of studies have demonstrated the promise
of vaccine-based immunotherapy for pancreatic cancer,
effective strategies targeting the immunosuppressive cells
are lacking [3–5].
Various types of tumors, including PDA, produce
TGF-β and exploit this mechanism to evade immune
attack via binding to its receptor [16]. There are three

isotypes of TGF-β, TGF-β 1, 2, and 3. The TGF-β receptor
(TGF-βR) is a heterodimer formed by TGF-βRI and
TGF-βRII. The overexpression of TGF-β by tumor cells
suppresses T cell responses through a variety of TGF-β
signaling pathways. TGF-β has also been shown to be
a crucial signal that regulates Tregs. Published studies
suggested that TGF-β induces the expression of the
transcription factor forkhead box 3 (FoxP3), which is a
master regulator in the development and differentiation of
CD4+CD25+ Tregs [17–19]. These regulatory T cells then
secrete TGF-β and other inhibitory cytokines to suppress
CD8+ T cell killing of tumor cells [19].
Several studies examined the feasibility of enhancing
anti-tumor immune responses through the inhibition
of Treg activity by CD25 cell surface marker blockade
[6– 8]. Although depletion of Tregs via CD25 blockade
leads to enhanced immunity in tumor models, removal of
T cells expressing CD25 also leads to the removal of Teffs,
which express CD25 after activation. Additionally, this
therapy currently lacks translational applicability since
a human antibody equivalent that can effectively deplete
human CD25+ T cells is unavailable. Tregs constitutively
express FoxP3, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated
protein 4 (CTLA-4), and glucocorticoid-induced TNF
receptor family-related protein (GITR) [9]. These factors
are believed to be crucial for the suppressive function of
Tregs. Therefore, depleting Tregs by targeting cell markers
such as CTLA-4 were studied. While clinical efficacy
has been demonstrated with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies,
a number of severe autoimmune side effects have been
observed, including inflammatory bowel pathology and
hyphophysitis [11]. Biologically, blockade of CTLA4 may not be sufficient given that Tregs from CTLA-4
knockout mice are still capable of suppressing the immune
response [12]. More recently, suppressing Treg cell
activity through GITR has been studied in tumor models
[13]. However, the human GITR blockade antibody is still
in the early phase clinical trials. Interestingly, low-dose
cyclophosphamide not only decreases cell numbers of
Tregs but leads to decreased functionality of Tregs [15].
However, cyclophosphamide also depletes Teffs. Thus,
optimal Treg targeting agents are lacking and are urgently
needed to improve the efficacy of immunotherapies for
PDA treatment.
Blocking TGF-β or its receptors has been shown to
have anti-cancer activities in preclinical cancer models
[20–22]. As mentioned above, TGF-β appears to be a
target for blocking Tregs. However, TGF-β blocking
agents have not yet been shown to target Tregs. The
clinical development of TGF-β blocking agents is still
challenging due to the lack of significant efficacy data for
single agent TGF-β targeting therapies; however, recent
early phase clinical trials using TGF-β blocking agents
in certain gastrointestinal cancers have shown promising
results [23].
Our group recently conducted a novel neoadjuvant and adjuvant study designed to evaluate
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

post-immunotherapy changes within the TME of
primary pancreatic tumors following treatment with our
pancreatic cancer GVAX vaccine, given either alone or
with immune modulating doses of cyclophosphamide [3].
With the same pancreatic cancer vaccine, it was previously
reported that low dose cyclophosphamide enhanced
higher avidity T cell responses that were associated with
longer progression free survival in patients [24]. The
aforementioned neoadjuvant vaccine study provided
the opportunity to dissect the PDA TME in the wholly
resected tumors. Pathological examination of tumor tissue
resected just two weeks following vaccination identified
the formation of novel immunotherapy-induced tertiary
lymphoid aggregates (TLAs), an organized lymphoid
structure that was not observed in tumors resected from
unvaccinated patients. Gene microarray analysis of micro
dissected vaccine-induced lymphoid aggregates identified
gene expression in the TGF-β pathway, which correlated
with improved patient outcomes. Most genes in the TGF-β
pathway, including multiple TGF-β isotypes and TGF-βR
subunits, were downregulated in lymphoid aggregates
from patients who survived more than 3 years, in patients
who demonstrated vaccine-enhanced mesothelin-specific
T cell responses, and in patients with increased Teff/
Treg (CD8/Foxp3) ratios within their tumors [3]. These
results suggested that targeting the TGF-β pathway might
further enhance antitumor immune response induced by
vaccine therapy. Therefore, in this study, we tested this
hypothesis in preclinical models of PDA and subsequently
demonstrated a significant effect of TGF-β blocking
antibodies on Tregs in a vaccine dependent manner. Our
study supports the clinical evaluation of TGF-β blocking
agents as combinational immunotherapy with cancer
vaccines.

RESULTS
TGF-β blockade in combination with GVAX
improves the cure rate of metastatic PDA in
murine tumor models
We examined whether combining GVAX with a
monoclonal pan-TGF-β neutralizing antibody, which
blocks all 3 of the TGF-β subtypes (αTGF-β), TGF-β
1,2, & 3, could improve the anti-tumor activity of GVAX
in two hepatic metastatic PDA models. The metastatic
PDA tumor model was established by hemispleen
injection of Panc02 or KPC tumor cells [25]. αTGF-β
or IgG isotype controls were administered either as a
monotherapy or in combination with GVAX (Figure 1A).
For the Panc02 model, αTGF-β or IgG isotype control was
administered 3 times per week for 3 weeks while GVAX
was administered once weekly for three weeks on days
4, 11 and 18 post tumor inoculation. The KPC model
treatment regimen consisted of αTGF-β or IgG controls
dosed on days 3, 5, and 7 post tumor inoculation with a
single GVAX vaccination on day 4.

Mice in the liver metastasis model bear a high
burden of malignant cells. Vaccine-based monotherapy has
been shown to cure only approximately 10% of the mice.
αTGF-β therapy alone did not cure any mice in this model.
Combinatorial GVAX and αTGF-β therapy significantly
improved the cure rate of mice compared to IgG control
treatment and αTGF-β monotherapy (35% vs. 0%, p < 0.05)
in the Panc02 tumor cell hemispleen model (Figure 1B).
When compared with GVAX plus IgG, the possibility of
combinatorial GVAX and αTGF-β having improved cure
rates cannot be excluded (35% vs. 10.5%, p = 0.07). Similar
experiments were performed to investigate this effect in
the KPC tumor cell hemispleen PDA model (Figure 1C).
Again, the possibility of the combination of GVAX and
αTGF-β having improved cure rates when compared
to GVAX plus IgG (30% vs. 11%, p = 0.13) cannot be
excluded (Figure 1D). These data suggest that, although
TGF-β blockade itself was not found to have an antitumor
activity in the tumor model tested here, TGF-β blockade is
able to enhance the antitumor activity of GVAX.
TGF-β blockade increased the cure rate with
GVAX to approximately 30%, suggesting that other
immunosuppressive pathways need to be targeted
simultaneously. We have previously showed that targeting
the PD-1 pathway in combination with GVAX can enhance
the cure rate to approximately 40% [26]. Therefore, we
tested the combination of αTGF-β and αPD-1 antibody
with GVAX (Figure 1E) and found that both blocking
agents together can increase the cure rate with GVAX to
50% and significantly improve median overall survival
versus GVAX and αTGF-β therapy alone (33 days vs. 82.5
days, p < 0.05) (Figure 1F and 1G). This result suggests
that TGF-β targets a non-PD-1 pathway, and its blockade
can enhance PD-1 blocking activity.

significantly lower in the combinatorial GVAX αTGF-β
group compared to the GVAX monotherapy (12,211 vs.
34,067 CD4+ T cells per liver, p < 0.05) (Figure 2C).
When looking specifically at CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs
(Figure 2D), GVAX therapy induced intratumoral Tregs,
suggesting that Tregs confers a checkpoint for vaccineinduced T cell responses. However, the combinatorial
group had a significantly lower percentage of Tregs
among all TILs as well as a reduction in the total absolute
number of Tregs within the TME when compared to
GVAX monotherapy (3.4% vs. 6.8%, p < 0.05; 461 vs.
2,629 Tregs per liver, respectively, p < 0.05) (Figure 2E
and 2F, respectively). By contrast, αTGF-β monotherapy
did not decrease either the percentage of Tregs or its
absolute number within the TME compared to the IgG
control. Notably, combinatorial GVAX and αTGF-β
therapy resulted in a significantly higher percentage
(Supplemental Figure 1A) and total number (Supplemental
Figure 1B) of non Treg CD4+ T cells within the TME
compared to GVAX with IgG and αTGF-β monotherapy
(p < 0.05 for all). Therefore, our data suggest that αTGF-β
therapy reduces Tregs within the TME in the setting of
combinational therapy with both GVAX and αTGF-β.

TGF-β blockade enhances antitumor effector
T cell responses within the TME in a GVAX
therapy dependent manner
Next, we examined whether Teffs in the TME
are affected by TGF-β blockade. Interestingly, neither
GVAX therapy nor αTGF-β therapy changed the
percentage of CD8+ TILs compared to control treatment
(Figure 3A). As previously observed [26], GVAX therapy
enhanced the absolute number of CD8+ TILs within
the TME (Figure 3B), while αTGF-β therapy had no
effect on the absolute number of CD8+ TILs. However,
the combination of GVAX and αTGF-β significantly
enhanced both the percentage and absolute number
of CD8+ TILs. In contrast, the percentage of IFNγ
producing cells among CD8+ TILs was not changed by
GVAX treatment (Figure 3C). However, αTGF-β did
significantly increase the percentage of IFNγ producing
cells among CD8+ TILs as a monotherapy but more in
combination with GVAX. Importantly, both the CD8+
T cell to Treg ratio and the CD8+IFNγ+ T cell to Treg ratio
within the TME were enhanced by αTGF-β therapy in a
GVAX therapy dependent manner (Figure 3D and 3E,
respectively).
To analyze antitumor antigen specific responses, we
analyzed the IFNγ production of CD8+ TILs incubated
with irradiated Panc02 tumor cells (Figure 4A). Both
GVAX and αTGF-β therapy enhanced the tumor-specific
Teff response as a monotherapy but significantly more
as combination therapy. In contrast, tumor-specific Teff
response in splenocytes was not enhanced by αTGF-β,
GVAX or the combination (Figure 4B).

TGF-β blockade reduces tregs in the PDA TME
in a GVAX therapy dependent manner
Our prior analysis of dissected human PDA lymphoid
aggregates showed that TGF-β signaling pathways were
downregulated and intratumoral Tregs were decreased
in vaccinated patients who had longer survival [3]. We
therefore examined whether there is an improved antitumor
efficacy of TGF-β blockade in combination with vaccine
therapy. We first evaluated the CD4+ T cell population
within the TME of metastatic Panc02 tumor bearing mice.
Tumor-bearing mice were treated with either αTGF-β or
IgG control on days 3, 5, and 7. GVAX was administered
once on day 4 (Figure 2A). On day 10, the livers were
harvested for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
analysis of liver infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL).
The percentages of CD4+ TILs among all TILs were
significantly lower in the combinatorial treatment group
compared to GVAX monotherapy (28.3% vs. 48.4%,
p < 0.0001) and αTGF-β monotherapy (28.3% vs. 48.6%,
p < 0.01) (Figure 2B). The total number of CD4+ TIL was

DISCUSSION

Taken together, these results suggested that GVAX
therapy leads to an increased CD8+ T cell presence in
the TME; however, it does not enhance the general IFNγ
production in these CD8+ TILs, in spite of enhancing the
tumor-specific IFNγ production. In contrast, αTGF-β
therapy does not increase CD8+ T cell presence within the
TME, but enhances the general IFNγ production of these
CD8+ TILs. Thus, αTGF-β therapy further enhances the
tumor-specific IFNγ production in CD8+ TILs in a GVAX
therapy dependent manner.

To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration
that TGF-β blockade partially depletes Tregs and
enhances tumor-specific Teffs in a vaccine dependent
manner. Our data show that that the combination of
GVAX therapy and TGF-β blockade has direct effects
on the tumors by enhancing CD8+ T cell infiltration and
decreasing the presence of immune suppressive Tregs in
the TME. Moreover, enhanced tumor specific CD8+ T cell

responses were seen within the tumors in mice treated with
combinatorial therapy. Importantly, these were not seen in
the periphery, implying that the antitumor immune response
is activated at the TME level. Finally, combinatorial GVAX
and αTGF-β lead to improved clinical responses in this
preclinical metastatic pancreatic cancer model.
The findings in this study also validated our
previous study [3] showing that the TGF-β pathway
is downregulated in the vaccine-induced lymphoid
aggregates in the PDAs of patients who had a longer
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

survival following vaccine therapy and also demonstrated
enhanced T cell responses to tumor antigens as well as
enhanced intratumoral Teff:Treg ratios. Although the role
of TGF-β in reducing Tregs in the TME is supported by
previous reports, our results also explain why TGF-β
blocking agents were not previously found to be very
effective as single agents. Our study may identify a more
effective way of targeting Tregs by combining the TGF-β
blockade with cancer vaccines that recruit both Teffs and
Tregs into the TME.

It remains unknown why TGF-β blockade only
targets Tregs in the presence of vaccine therapy (Figure 5).
It is possible that the signals induced by vaccine therapy
coordinate with TGF-β blockade antibodies to target
Tregs. More likely, TGF-β blockade only targets vaccineactivated Tregs, but not tumor-residential Tregs. It cannot
be excluded that TGF-β blockade directly inhibits the
immunosuppressive signaling in vaccine-induced CD8 T
cells. The role of TGF-β in Treg development may also
lie in the activation of Tregs by the immune response to
antigens. One possibility is that TGF-β blockade decreases
the Treg number or function and subsequently enhances
the effector T cell function in response to the vaccine
therapy. Anti-TGF-β monotherapy does have the effect
of increasing the percentage of IFNγ producing cells
among CD8+ TILs as a monotherapy. This is anticipated
as published literature shows that TGF-β blockade can
activate Teffs through other mechanisms, likely by
removing the immunosuppressive signaling secondary to
TGF-β acting directly on the Teffs [27, 28].
Targeting Tregs is not sufficient to break the
tolerance in the TME in all PDA tumor-bearing mice.
The same logic would apply to solely targeting Tregs
in human PDA patients. We found only approximately
30% of mice were cured with the combination of TGF-β
blockade and GVAX. Similarly, we previously found
[26] that the combination of anti-PD-1 antibody and
GVAX cured approximately 40% of tumor-bearing mice.
Therefore, to maximize the effect of immunotherapy,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

both PD-1 and Treg pathways should be targeted. In
addition, given the pleotropic roles of TGF-β signaling
pathways, other immune cell subtypes remain to be
examined for a comprehensive understanding of the
mechanisms underlying the antitumor effect of the
GVAX and TGF-β combination. Moreover, other
immunosuppressive pathways remain to be identified
and targeted to achieve improved cures that can
eventually be tested in patients with PDA.
Our preclinical metastatic PDA model focuses
on metastases to the liver, which is the most common
metastatic site of human PDA. In particular, the TME
in this mouse model reflects that seen in human PDA.
Nevertheless, this is still an experimental model as
pancreatic cancer patients with liver metastases cannot
be cured by the pancreatic cancer GVAX alone [3–4].
The advantage of this model over the autochthonous
mouse model is that the tumor formation is timely and
spatially controlled, allowing a large sample size in single
experiments. Our results suggest that a potentially more
effective immunotherapy strategy includes the pancreatic
cancer vaccine in combination with TGF-β  inhibitor.
Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as αPD-1 antibodies
may be added to further optimize the immunotherapy
strategy once the immune modulating effects of the triple
combination of GVAX, TGF-β inhibitor and αPD-1
therapy are further characterized in the preclinical models.
Thus, the immunotherapy strategy supported by our
preclinical studies warrants testing in human pancreatic

Mouse IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA)
CD8+ T cells from liver infiltrating lymphocytes and
splenocytes were isolated using CD8 negative isolation
kits (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Irradiated Panc02 tumor cells were added
to isolated CD8 T cells at a ratio of 5:1 (2 × 105 CD8+
T cells combined with 4 × 104 Panc02 tumor cells) and
were subsequently incubated for 18 hours in 5% CO2 at
37°C. The ELISA assay was then conducted using mouse
IFNγ ELISA Ready-SET-Go assay per the manufacturer’s
protocol (eBioscience).

The cure rates are calculated as the percentages of
mice that remain free of tumor according to the necropsy
examination at the end of the experiment (Day 90 following
the tumor implantation). Statistical analysis for comparison
of cure rates were evaluated using χ2 test. Mean values
between groups for cell number, percentage and cytokine
expression were evaluated using an unpaired Student’s t test.
P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
