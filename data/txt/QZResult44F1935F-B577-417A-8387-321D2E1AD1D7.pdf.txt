Abstract

Author Manuscript

The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) bestows cancer cells with increased stem cell
properties and metastatic potential. To date, multiple extracellular stimuli and transcription factors
have been shown to regulate EMT. Many of them are not druggable and therefore it is necessary
to identify targets, which can be inhibited using small molecules to prevent metastasis. Recently,
we identified the ganglioside GD2 as a novel breast cancer stem cell marker. Moreover, we found
that GD3 synthase (GD3S)—an enzyme involved in GD2 biosynthesis—is critical for GD2
production and could serve as a potential druggable target for inhibiting tumor initiation and
metastasis. Indeed, there is a small-molecule known as triptolide that has been shown to inhibit
GD3S function. Accordingly, in this manuscript, we demonstrate that the inhibition of GD3S
using shRNA or triptolide compromises the initiation and maintenance of EMT instigated by
various signaling pathways, including Snail, Twist and TGF-β1 as well as the mesenchymal
characteristics of claudin-low breast cancer cell lines (SUM159 and MDA-MB-231). Moreover,
GD3S is necessary for wound healing, migration, invasion and stem cell properties in vitro. Most
importantly, inhibition of GD3S in vivo prevents metastasis in experimental as well as in

spontaneous syngeneic wild-type mouse models. We also demonstrate that the transcription factor
FOXC2, a central downstream mediator/effector of several EMT pathways, directly regulates
GD3S expression by binding to its promoter. In clinical specimens, the expression of GD3S
correlates with poor prognosis in triple negative human breast tumors. Moreover, GD3S
expression correlates with activation of the c-Met signaling pathway leading to increased stem cell
properties and metastatic competence. Collectively, these findings suggest that the GD3S-c-Met
axis could serve as an effective target for the treatment of metastatic breast cancers.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a normal developmental process where by
epithelial cells lose their epithelial characteristics, such as cell-cell adhesions, and undergo a
dramatic remodeling of the cytoskeleton that culminates in the acquisition of a motile
mesenchymal phenotype.(1–3) This complex series of morphological changes is
accompanied by the downregulation of epithelial markers (e.g., E-cadherin) and the
upregulation of mesenchymal markers (e.g., N-cadherin and vimentin). EMT occurs during
embryogenesis as well as in tissue repair, fibrosis, and cancer.(4–6) During cancer
progression, the EMT process endows cancer cells with the ability to metastasize. EMT and
metastasis are regulated by distinct signaling molecules present in the tumor
microenvironment (e.g., transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), Wnt, tumor necrosis
factor-α (TNF-α), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and Notch),(7–9) and a variety of
intracellular transcription factors (e.g., Snail, Twist, and Goosecoid).(10–16

Cells that undergo EMT also acquire self-renewal capabilities, express stem cell-associated
CD44highCD24low cell-surface markers, and become resistant to chemotherapy.(17–22) We
recently found that epithelial cells induced to undergo EMT behave similar to mesenchymal
stem/stromal cells (MSCs).(23) Furthermore, the ganglioside GD2, normally known to be
expressed in MSCs, is also expressed on the cell surface of breast CSCs and can be used for
their isolation.(24) Although suppression of GD3 synthase (GD3S), the rate-limiting enzyme
for GD2 biosynthesis, hampers mammosphere formation and stem cell properties,(24) its
role in metastasis is not known. Among various signaling pathways, c-Met (HGF receptor)
is frequently deregulated in many cancers, and is known to promote invasion, survival, and
metastasis.(25–33) Moreover, GD3S expression has been shown to enhance the proliferation
of MDA-MB-231 cells through the activation of c-Met.(34) In this manuscript, we describe
that GD3S not only regulates EMT and CSC properties, but also metastasis in vivo. GD3S
regulates stem cell function via c-Met and the expression of GD3S is regulated by FOXC2, a
transcription factor functioning downstream of several EMT signaling pathways. In
addition, we report that GD3S expression is high in EMT/CSC-enriched claudin-low/triple
negative human breast cancers and that its expression correlates with poor patient survival.

RESULTS
GD3S is necessary for the initiation and maintenance of EMT

Author Manuscript

Earlier, we found that the ganglioside GD2 serves as a marker for breast CSCs and that the
enzyme GD3S is essential for GD2 biosynthesis.(24) Since CSCs and cells that have
undergone EMT share many properties, we investigated whether GD3S is necessary for
maintaining the mesenchymal status of cells experimentally induced to undergo EMT
(HMLE-Snail, HMLE-Twist) as well as established breast cancer cell lines (SUM159,
MDA-MB-231). For this, we used shRNA to suppress GD3S expression and found that
inhibition of GD3S expression substantially altered the morphology of each cell type,
causing increased clustering of cells into epithelial-like islands with the establishment of
cell-cell contacts and reduced fibroblastic morphology (Figure 1a). Furthermore, the
expression of the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, fibronectin and vimentin were reduced
to varying degrees in the absence of GD3S (Figure 1b).
Likewise, the inhibition of GD3S activity in the aforementioned cells using the small
molecule inhibitor triptolide(35) induced an epithelial-like morphology (Figure 1c)
accompanied by a reduction in the expression of mesenchymal markers (Supplementary
Figure 1a) without changing the rate of cell proliferation (Supplementary Figure 1b). In
addition, we observed increased expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin in HMLESnail, HMLE-Twist, and MDA-MB-231 cells, but not in SUM159 cells (Figure 1b and
Supplementary Figure 1a). Collectively, these findings suggest that GD3S is necessary for
the maintenance of mesenchymal properties of both cells induced to undergo EMT as well
as mesenchymal-appearing breast cancer cell lines.

Since the induction of EMT in tumors can generate new CSCs and/or replenish the existing
CSC pool, deterring the mechanisms underlying the initiation of EMT is as important as
targeting cells that have already undergone EMT. To examine the potential role of GD3S in
the initiation of EMT, we utilized a TGF-β1 inducible model and report that blocking GD3S
activity prevented the acquisition of a spindle-like morphology in TGFβ-treated (2 ng/ml)
MCF10A cells (Figures 1d, e and Supplementary Figure 1c). We observed similar results
using the mouse mammary EpH4Ras epithelial cell line (Supplementary Figure 1d), further
supporting the notion that GD3S is necessary for TGF-β1 mediated induction of EMT. In the
same manner, we found that the Snail-ER fusion protein, known to elicit EMT in the
presence of 4-OHT,(19) failed to confer an overt mesenchymal morphology, when GD3S
expression was suppressed using shRNA (Figures 1f and g) or triptolide (Figures 1h and i).
Accordingly, the induction of mesenchymal markers was delayed in these cells compared to
control counterparts (Figures 1g, i). GD3S expression is high in cells that have undergone
EMT as well as in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells when compared to cells with
no EMT features (Supplementary Figure 1e) which further underscores the links between
GD3S and EMT properties. Collectively, these findings show that GD3S plays a critical role
in the maintenance of a mesenchymal phenotype in cells that have undergone EMT, as well
as in the initiation of EMT in response to Snail, Twist, and TGF-β1 in several model
systems.

GD3S regulates invasion and motility of cancer cells

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Passage of cells through an EMT not only promotes the acquisition of stem cell properties
but is also known to confer concomitant migratory and invasive capabilities.(1–3) To test
whether GD3S also regulates invasion, HMLE-Snail and MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured
in a 3D laminin-rich extracellular matrix Matrigel (3D lrECM). As expected, vehicle-treated
cells grew as highly invasive stellate structures (Figure 2a). In sharp contrast, when we
inhibited GD3S expression using triptolide, cells formed non-invasive multicellular
structures (Figure 2a) with the basement membrane intact as indicated by the presence of a
continuous laminin V layer (Figure 2b). Moreover, the number of invasive acinus structures
was significantly decreased in triptolide-treated lrECM cultures (Figure 2c). Similar results
were obtained using MDA-MB-231 and HMLE-Snail cells expressing GD3S shRNA
(Figures 2d and e). We also employed MCF10A cells known to form highly organized
multicellular acini with an intact basement membrane(36) when cultured in 3D lrECM.
However, in the presence of TGF-β1, MCF10A cells form irregular invasive structures with
a disrupted basement membrane. We found that concurrent exposure to triptolide
considerably decreased TGF-β1 mediated invasive acinus formation and restored the
integrity of the basement membrane when compared to vehicle-treated cells (Figure 2f).
Finally, we also investigated the role of GD3S in cell migration using a scratch assay and
found that inhibition of GD3S expression by triptolide (Figure 2g) or shRNA-mediated
silencing (Figure 2h) reduced migration significantly in MDA-MB-231 and HMLE-Snail
cells. Collectively, these findings show that GD3S is necessary for EMT as well as EMTassociated cell migration and invasive properties.
GD3S plays an important role in metastasis

In order to examine the role of GD3S in the regulation of metastasis, we injected 4T1 cells
(10,000) orthotopically into the mammary fat-pad of syngeneic wild type BALB/c mice.
Once the mice had developed palpable tumors (Figure 3b), we treated one set with triptolide
—which inhibits GD3S, mesenchymal markers (Figure 3a) as well as GD2 expression in
4T1 cells (Supplementary Figure 2a)—and the other set with vehicle. The vehicle-treated
mice developed lung metastasis as evidenced by strong luminescence in the lungs, whereas
the triptolide-treated mice had significantly decreased luminescence in the lungs (Figure 3c),
indicating a reduced metastatic burden. To examine the role of GD3S in primary tumor
formation and metastasis, we suppressed the expression of GD3S using shRNA in 4T1 cells.
Upon confirming the knockdown (Supplementary Figure 2b), we injected 4T1 cells
expressing control-shRNA or GD3S-shRNA (100,000) orthotopically into the mammary fatpad of syngeneic wild type BALB/c mice. Remarkably, the GD3S-shRNA expressing 4T1
cells yielded primary tumors which were significantly smaller in size compared to those
generated by control-shRNA 4T1 cells, with the exception of one mouse (Supplementary
Figure 2c). In addition, mice harboring the control-shRNA expressing 4T1 cells developed
large lung foci as evidenced by strong luminescence in the lungs, whereas the mice injected
with GD3S-shRNA expressing 4T1 cells exhibited significantly reduced luminescence in the
lungs, consistent with a markedly reduced metastatic burden (Supplementary Figure 2d). To
confirm that the reduction in lung nodules in mice harboring GD3S-shRNA expressing 4T1
cells was not due to the reduction in primary tumor size, we investigated the role of GD3S in
experimental metastasis. For this, we injected 0.5 × 106 RFP/luciferase-labeled MDAOncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 June 04.

MB-231 cells via the tail vein and subsequently treated the mice with either vehicle or
triptolide for six weeks and analyzed for the presence of lung metastases using
bioluminescent imaging.(24, 35) Whereas mice harboring vehicle-treated or control shRNA
expressing MDA-MB-231 cells developed metastases (Figures 3d, e), inhibition of GD3S
using triptolide or shRNA significantly reduced the metastatic burden (Figures 3d, e).

Using hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) staining, we further confirmed the presence of large
metastatic foci in the lungs of mice injected with control-shRNA expressing MDA-MB-231
cells (Figure 3f) but not in mice injected with GD3S-shRNA expressing MDA-MB-231
cells. Similarly, we only detected metastatic foci in the lungs of mice injected with MDAMB-231 cells and subsequently treated with vehicle (Figure 3f) but not in mice injected with
MDA-MB-231 cells and subsequently treated with triptolide. In order to distinguish whether
GD3S regulates seeding of the cells to the lung or the expansion of seeded cells into
macroscopic nodules, we performed immunofluorescence using anti-RFP on the lungs of
mice injected with RFP-labeled MDA-MB-231 cells and treated with triptolide or RFPlabeled MDA-MB-231 cells expressing GD3S-shRNA relative to their respective control
mice. While, we observed extensive RFP staining indicative of the presence of large
metastatic foci in the lungs of mice injected with control-shRNA expressing MDA-MB-231
cells (Figure 3f, lower panel) or vehicle-treated MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 3f, lower
panel), we did not find colonies of RFP-positive cells in mice injected with GD3S-shRNA
expressing MDA-MB-231 cells or in the triptolide-treated mice harboring MDA-MB-231
cells. However, we did observe numerous RFP-positive single cells in the lungs of mice
harboring MDA-MB-231 cells expressing GD3S-shRNA or mice harboring MDA-MB-231
cells that were treated with triptolide, even though we did not observe lung nodules in these
animals (Figures 3f, lower panel). These findings suggest that inhibition of GD3S does not
compromise the seeding of cells to the lung but that it prevents the expansion of solitary
disseminated tumor cells to macrometastatic lesions. Collectively, these data suggest that
GD3S plays an important role in regulating experimental metastasis.

Author Manuscript

In order to examine the role of GD3S in EMT in vivo, 4T1 tumor samples were processed
for histology and immunostaining with GD2 as well as EMT markers (E-cadherin and
vimentin). Using H & E staining, we showed that inhibition of GD3S limits the invasion of
the tumor into the surrounding tissue rendering the tumor smooth at its edges with a
histology characteristic of a non-invasive tumor (Supplementary Figure 2e). GD2 was
increased at the invasive front of vehicle-treated tumors whereas its expression was
significantly reduced in triptolide-treated samples (Figure 3g). E-cadherin was localized
mostly to the membrane in triptolide-treated tumors (Figure 3h), whereas staining was
diffuse in vehicle-treated tumors. Conversely, vimentin expression was reduced (Figure 3i)
in triptolide-treated 4T1 tumors compared to vehicle-treated samples. We also cultured
MDA-MB-231 cells in 3D lrECM and exposed them to vehicle or triptolide. Acini were
stained with laminin V as well as E-cadherin and N-cadherin. Inhibition of GD3S using
triptolide inhibited N-cadherin expression (Supplementary Figure 2f, upper panel) whereas it
induced laminin V and E-cadherin (Supplementary Figure 2f, lower panel). Collectively
these data show that inhibition of GD3S inhibits EMT in vitro and in vivo.

GD3S expression is regulated by NF-kB via FOXC2 and predicts poor clinical outcome

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Since the transcription factor FOXC2 is a downstream mediator of multiple different EMT
signaling pathways,(37) we investigated whether FOXC2 could regulate GD3S expression.
For this, we silenced FOXC2 expression in MDA-MB-231 and HMLE-Snail cells using
shRNA and analyzed GD3S expression. We observed a significant reduction in GD3S
mRNA, as well as GD3S protein, following silencing of FOXC2 in HMLE-Snail and MDAMB-231 cells (Figures 4a-c). To examine whether FOXC2 directly regulates GD3S
expression, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay using HMLESnail cells and found that FOXC2 preferentially binds to a region around 1.0 kb (-1.0 kb)
upstream of the GD3S transcription start site (Figure 4d), thus confirming that GD3S is
transcriptionally regulated by FOXC2. Consistent with this, using an in vitro wound healing
assay, we observed concomitant induction of both FOXC2 and GD3S at the wound site
(Supplementary Figure 2g). Since, triptolide is known to inhibit GD3S, as well as NF-kB,
(38) and NF-kB is known to regulate FOXC2,(39) we examined whether NF-kB could
regulate GD3S via FOXC2. For this, we overexpressed an IkB super-repressor mutant (IKBSR), known to inhibit NF-kB, in MDA-MB-231 and HMLE-Snail cells and found that the
transcripts encoding GD3S and FOXC2 were reduced following overexpression of IKB-SR
(Figures 4e and f). Furthermore, overexpression of FOXC2 in these IKB-SR expressing cells
restored the expression of GD3S (Figures 4g, h). To further confirm that NF-kB and FOXC2
promote EMT in a GD3S-dependent manner, we overexpressed FOXC2 in GD3S-silenced
MDA-MB-231 cells and found that FOXC2 overexpression was not able to rescue either the
EMT phenotype (Figure 4i) or mammosphere formation (Figure 4j) in the absence of GD3S.
We also observed that overexpression of FOXC2 in MDA-MB-231 cells made them
resistant to triptolide (Supplementary Figures 3a-e). Collectively, these findings indicate that
GD3S expression is regulated by NF-kB via FOXC2. Moreover, our bioinformatic analyses
indicate that GD3S expression is high in claudin-low/TNBCs (Figure 4k) and that it
correlates with poor patient survival (Figure 4l).
GD3S regulates EMT and metastasis via activation of the c-Met signaling pathway

Author Manuscript

A recent study demonstrated that GD3S could enhance the proliferation and primary tumor
growth of MDA-MB-231 cells via c-Met-signaling.(28) In order to test whether GD3S
expression correlates with the active and phosphorylatable form of c-Met, we analyzed the
expression of phosphorylated c-Met across a panel of cell lines that have undergone EMT or
exist in a mesenchymal state. Interestingly, we observed elevated phospho-c-Met (p-c-Met)
in cells with EMT/CSC properties (MDA-MB-231, SUM159, HMLE-Twist, -Snail, and TGF-β1) relative to their epithelial counterparts (MCF-10A, HMLE-vector) even though all
the cells expressed similar levels of total c-Met (Figure 5a). Moreover, the pattern of c-Met
phosphorylation strongly correlates with GD3S expression in all of the cells examined
(Figure 5a). To investigate if GD3S expression is regulated by c-Met, we treated the cells
expressing high GD3S and p-c-Met with SU11274, a c-Met inhibitor, and found that
SU11274 is capable of reducing the expression of vimentin and increasing E-cadherin levels
in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 5b). Furthermore, SU11274 treatment substantially altered
cell morphology causing increased clustering of cells into epithelial-like islands with
prominent cell-cell contacts and reduced fibroblastic morphology (Figure 5c). Lastly, the

sphere-forming capacity of these cells was also significantly reduced in the presence of
SU11274 (Figure 5d and Supplementary Figure 3f). While we observed loss of EMT/CSC
functions in the presence of SU11274, we did not see any change in the expression of GD3S
(Figure 5b) suggesting that c-Met signaling functions downstream of GD3S.
To investigate whether GD3S regulates the activation of c-Met, we examined the presence
of total-c-Met as well as p-c-Met in MDA-MB-231 cells expressing GD3S-shRNA
compared to the control-shRNA. Indeed, we found no change in total c-Met protein, but a
significant decrease in active p-c-Met protein as well as its downstream signal mediator
phospho-Akt (Figure 5e) suggesting that GD3S regulates only the function of c-Met and not
its expression.

Author Manuscript

To further examine if activation of c-Met is sufficient to rescue the EMT/CSC properties in
the absence of GD3S, we ectopically expressed a constitutively active form of c-Met (TprMet)(29) in MDA-MB-231-shGD3S cells. Expression of Tpr-Met successfully restored the
mesenchymal properties of these cells, even in the absence of GD3S, as evidenced by the
acquisition of a mesenchymal-like morphology (Figure 5f), elevated expression of vimentin
(Figure 5g) and enhanced mammosphere-forming efficiency relative to the control vectorexpressing cells (Figure 5h). Next, we tested these cells for their ability to seed metastasis in
vivo and found that mice injected with MDA-MB-231-shGD3S-Tpr-Met cells had
significantly more lung metastases and reduced event-free survival compared to mice
injected with MDA-MB-231-shGD3S-vector control cells (Figure 5i).

DISCUSSION
Author Manuscript

Recent studies have clearly shown that the EMT process can promote the generation of
CSCs,(19) which contribute to therapy resistance, tumor relapse and metastasis.(17, 18, 21,
22) To achieve an optimal clinical outcome, it is imperative: 1) to identify and target cancer
cells with EMT/CSC properties, preexisting within a tumor, and 2) to prevent the de novo
generation of CSCs via EMT during therapy. In this study, we report that GD3S is expressed
at high levels in claudin-low/TNBC cell lines and patient tumors and that it is necessary for
the acquisition and maintenance of EMT/CSC properties in multiple EMT models and
claudin-low/triple negative breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
inhibiting GD3S using shRNA or the small molecule inhibitor triptolide could provide an
effective strategy for the inhibition or reversal of the mesenchymal phenotype as well as
metastasis in breast cancer.

Author Manuscript

Although GD2 synthase (GD2S) is directly responsible for GD2 biosynthesis, we previously
found that GD3S, and not GD2S, is the rate-limiting enzyme in GD2 biosynthesis in cells
that have undergone EMT as well as in mesenchymal-looking established breast cancer cell
lines.(24) Moreover, the results presented here, along with our earlier findings,(24) clearly
show that GD3S is functionally important both for mesenchymal properties as well as stem
cell function. Although, it is not clear how an enzyme involved in GD2 biosynthesis might
regulate EMT, migration, invasion and metastasis, we speculate that GD2—the product of
the GD3S biosynthetic pathway—may play a pivotal role in regulating these attributes either
in an inter- or intra-cellular manner. Furthermore, we have established links between GD3S

expression and activation of the c-Met signaling pathway. Moreover, our findings
demonstrate that GD3S is important for the initiation of EMT in response to TGF-β1 as well
as Snail and Twist. In addition, we have shown that NF-kB—known to respond to numerous
inflammatory stimuli—can indirectly regulate GD3S transcription via the transcription
factor FOXC2, a central mediator of multiple EMT programs. Thus, we speculate that GD3S
may possibly play an important role in regulating EMT properties in response to a variety of
EMT-promoting signals emanating from the tumor microenvironment including TNF-alpha.
With these considerations in mind, we propose that GD3S is likely to be an important
therapeutic target for multiple EMT pathways operating in breast tumors.

Author Manuscript

Whereas inhibition of GD3S, using shRNA or triptolide, significantly reduced the metastatic
burden in mice, it also reduced primary tumor growth. This suggests that GD3S and,
possibly GD2, may be important for the expansion of tumor cells in vivo but not in vitro,
because inhibition of GD3S did not affect cell proliferation rates in vitro. This is further
evidenced upon closer examination of the lungs in the mice injected with GD3S shRNAexpressing cells or treated with triptolide, in which we observed numerous presumably
dormant solitary tumor cells that failed to grow into macroscopic nodules. These data
suggest that GD3S is important for the differentiation/expansion of cells after they have
seeded to the lung. Indeed, this fits well with our data that inhibition of GD3S inhibits c-Met
signaling, which is important for the sustained proliferation and self-renewal properties of
CSCs.(40

Author Manuscript

Our data indicate that GD3S expression is high in TNBCs and that its expression predicts
poor clinical outcome, consistent with the notion that GD3S-mediated generation of GD2
enhances stem cell properties and may be responsible for the aggressive nature of these
tumors and the poor clinical outcome observed. Since GD3S is an enzyme and there is a
small molecule inhibitor available to inhibit its expression, we believe that our data attest to
the potential efficacy of triptolide for the treatment of TNBCs and for eradicating CSCenriched tumors. Our findings also suggest that targeting GD3S or c-Met signaling could be
effective against tumor progression and metastasis. The findings presented here establish
GD3S as a novel functional gene specific to cells that have undergone EMT as well as
mesenchymal-looking breast cancer cells and suggest that GD3S could serve as a novel
therapeutic target for mesenchymal-appearing triple negative claudin-low tumors. Since
targeted agents against GD3S, e.g. triptolide,(41) are currently in clinical trials, we envisage
that the optimal clinical outcome will only be achieved by using triptolide or c-Met inhibitor
to eradicate CSCs in combination with standard-of-care therapies that target the
differentiated cells of the tumor bulk and that this approach will be effective for treating
primary tumors and metastases.

Plasmids and viral transduction

Author Manuscript

The method used for the production of lentiviruses and amphotropic retroviruses as well as
the transduction of target cells was previously described.(42) IKB SR puromycin resistant

For western blotting, proteins were extracted by lysing cells in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche,
Nutley, NJ, USA). Protein was quantified using the Bradford Assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA,
USA) and 50 µg of total protein was resolved using 4-12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE gels
(NuPage, Invitrogen) and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were probed with
primary antibodies, including anti-β-actin (Sigma A3853, St. Louis, MO, USA), FOXC2
(developed by Dr. Naoyuki Miura, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Japan), Ecadherin (BD, 61081, San Jose, CA, USA), fibronectin (BD, 610077), N-cadherin (BD,
610910), vimentin (Novus, NB200-623, Littleton, CO, USA), GD3 synthase (Abcam,

Cruz, sc-11769-R), Smad (Santa Cruz, sc-6032), p-Akt (Cell signaling, 9271S), Akt (Cell
signaling, 9272). Following incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
species-specific antibodies, immunoreactive proteins were detected using
chemiluminescence (ECL Plus, GE Healthcare, Barrington, IL). Immunofluorescence
staining of cells was performed as previously described (37) and formalin-fixed paraffinembedded tissue sections were stained as described(43) using the above mentioned

Institutional policies. To assess the experimental metastatic potential of cells, 5 × 105 MDAMB-231- control-shRNA and GD3S shRNA cells labeled with RFP-firefly luciferase were
injected into NOD/SCID mice via the tail vein. Mice were assessed weekly for metastasis
via the intraperitoneal injection of D-Luciferin (Caliper LifeSciences). After allowing 10
minutes, in vivo bioluminescence was assessed using the IVIS imaging system 200 series
(Xenogen Corporation). Mice were monitored for lung metastasis and sacrificed after 6
weeks, at which time the lungs were surgically removed and fixed using Bouin's fluid and
the number of lung tumor nodules was counted using a dissection microscope. Lungs were
further subjected to H & E staining and stained for RFP to ascertain the presence of MDAMB-231 cells. To assess the inhibitory effect of triptolide on experimental metastasis, 0.5 ×
106 MDA-MB-231 cells labeled with RFP-firefly luciferase were injected into NOD/SCID
mice via tail vein injection. Thereafter, triptolide (0.15 mg/kg/day) was administered
intraperitoneally on a daily basis. Mice were sacrificed after 6 weeks, and lung metastatic
nodules were quantified as detailed above.

To examine the role of GD3S on tumor formation and spontaneous metastasis, 0.1 × 106
4T1-control-shRNA and 4T1-GD3S shRNA cells were injected orthotopically into the
mammary fat pad of BALB/c mice. Mice were assessed weekly for tumor size and
metastasis via the intraperitoneal injection of D-Luciferin. Tumors and lung metastases were
measured after sacrificing the mice at 3 weeks. To confirm the role of GD3S on the
progression of metastasis, 10,000 4T1 cells were injected into BALB/c mice and once
palpable tumors had formed, one set of mice was treated with triptolide and the other set was
treated with vehicle. Tumors and lung metastases were measured after sacrificing the mice
at 5 weeks. To ascertain the role of Tpr-Met on experimental metastasis in the absence of
GD3S, 0.5 × 106 MDA-MB-231-GD3S shRNA-vector and MDA-MB-231-GD3S shRNATpr-Met cells, labeled with RFP-firefly luciferase, were injected into NOD/SCID mice via
tail vein injection. Mice were assessed weekly for metastasis via the intraperitoneal injection
of D-Luciferin. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve was generated.
Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plus kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. All qRT-PCR experiments were run in triplicate and a mean value was used for
the determination of mRNA levels. Relative quantification of the mRNA levels was
performed using the comparative Ct method with GAPDH as the reference gene and with
the formula 2−ΔΔCt.
Scratch assays

Author Manuscript

Cells (approximately 3 × 105 cells/well) were seeded in culture dishes and allowed to adhere
for 8 to 10 h in medium containing 0.5% FBS in the case of MDA-MB-231 and only
medium without FBS in the case of HMLE-Snail cells. A scratch was done using a sterile
pipette tip and the dish was filled with fresh medium. Wound closure was monitored and
recorded over time.
