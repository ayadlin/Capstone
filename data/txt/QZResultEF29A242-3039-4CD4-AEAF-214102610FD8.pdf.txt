Abstract
A novel acetylenic tricyclic bis-(cyano enone), TBE-31, is a lead
compound in a series of tricyclic compounds with enone
functionalities in rings A and C. Nanomolar concentrations of
this potent multifunctional molecule suppress the induction
of the inflammatory protein, inducible nitric oxide synthase,
activate phase 2 cytoprotective enzymes in vitro and in vivo,
block cell proliferation, and induce differentiation and
apoptosis of leukemia cells. Oral administration of TBE-31
also significantly reduces formation of aflatoxin-DNA adducts
and decreases size and number of aflatoxin-induced preneoplastic hepatic lesions in rats by >90%. Because of the two
cyano enones in rings A and C, TBE-31 may directly interact
with DTT and protein targets such as Keap1 that contain
reactive cysteine residues. The above findings suggest that
TBE-31 should also be tested for chemoprevention and
chemotherapy in relevant models of cancer and against other
chronic, degenerative diseases in which inflammation and
oxidative stress contribute to disease pathogenesis. [Cancer

Introduction
Cancer is the leading cause of death in people under ages 85
years in the United States, and mortality from this disease is not
declining at an appreciable rate (1). Therefore, there is an
immense need to develop new compounds and strategies to
decrease the incidence and mortality of cancer. There are
numerous processes that participate in the transformation of a
normal cell to a malignant state, as hundreds of different genes
have been found to be mutated frequently in breast and
colorectal cancers (2, 3). Both inflammation and oxidative stress
are key components contributing to the process of carcinogenesis
(4–7). Uncontrolled proliferation, failure to differentiate correctly,
and the ability to evade apoptotic processes are also highly
pertinent to this disease. Therefore, compounds that prevent or

reverse these processes should be useful as chemopreventive and
chemotherapeutic agents (8).
Over the past decade, we have successively reported that a
series of novel pentacyclic oleanane triterpenoids, including
2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO) and its
methyl ester (CDDO-Me) and imidazolide (CDDO-Im) potently
inhibit the ability of cytokines to induce inducible nitric oxide
synthase (iNOS) in primary mouse macrophages or in RAW264.7
macrophage-like cells. These semisynthetic triterpenoids also
induce phase 2 cytoprotective enzymes, inhibit proliferation, and
induce differentiation and apoptosis of cancer cells, and are
effective for the prevention and treatment of cancer in a variety
of preclinical animal models (9). CDDO-Me (10) is currently in
early clinical trials for the treatment of cancer.
More recently, we have described the total synthesis and
preliminary biological properties of novel tricyclic compounds
with the same enone functionalities in rings A and C required
for the potent biological activities of CDDO (11, 12). Moreover,
structure-activity studies indicate that the entire structure of
CDDO might not be necessary for potency. In designing tricyclicbis-enone (TBE) compounds (Fig. 1), we wished to avoid some of
the limitations of synthetic oleanane triterpenoids, in which only
a single functionality at C-17 could be modified and an
expensive 11 step synthesis is required to convert oleanolic acid
into CDDO. In contrast, the TBEs are entirely synthetic and,
thus, are not hindered by limited functional groups or by steric
hindrance, and these new compounds may have more structural
diversity, better stability, and enhanced pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic profiles compared with the oleanane triterpenoids. An early TBE-compound, TBE-9, is nearly equivalent to
CDDO in potency, both in vitro and in vivo (11, 13), so we have
continued the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of new
TBE analogues. The acetylenic tricyclic bis-(cyano enone), TBE31 [(F)-(4aa,8aa,10ah)-1,2,4a,6,8a,9,10,10a-octahydro-8a-ethynyl1,1,4a-trimethyl-2,6-dioxophenanthrene-3,7-dicarbonitrile], synthesized from cyclohexanone as a starting material, is much more
active than CDDO (12). Here, we report that TBE-31 potently
inhibits iNOS, activates the phase 2 response, and induces
differentiation and apoptosis of cancer cells. TBE-31 also is
orally available and is exceptionally effective at blocking both the
formation of aflatoxin-B1 (AFB1)-DNA adducts and AFB1-induced
tumorigenesis in vivo; moreover, it has better pharmacokinetic
and/or pharmacodynamic properties than many pentacyclic
oleanane triterpenoids.

and CDDO-Im.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. The synthesis of the TBEs and CDDO-Im have been described
(11–15). Compounds were dissolved in DMSO, and controls containing

equal volumes of DMSO (V0.1%) were included in all experiments. Sources
of reagents and antibodies were as follows: H2DCFDA (Molecular Probes);
antibodies against iNOS, HO-1, InBa, Id1, and Id2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies); pSTAT3 (Cell Signaling Technology); PARP (Upstate); and CD11b-RPE
(Dako). Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) was obtained from Sigma Co.
In vitro assays. U937 and RAW264.7 cells, from the American Type
Culture Collection, were grown in RMPI supplemented with 5% or 10% fetal
bovine serum, respectively. Cells were treated with TBEs or CDDO-Im, and
cell extracts were analyzed by Western blotting with iNOS, HO-1, pSTAT3,
InBa, Id1, and Id2 or tubulin antibodies, by flow cytometry for production
of ROS or induction of CD11b, or for NQO1 enzyme activity. For
proliferation assays, cells were treated with compounds for 3 d, pulsed
with 3H-thymidine for 2 h, and its incorporation into cells measured by
scintillation counting. Apoptosis was analyzed by fluorescence-activated
cell sorting using the TACS Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection kit (R & D
Systems) or by Western blotting with PARP antibodies. Additional details
are included in the figure or table legends using previously published
methods (15–18).
TBE-31 absorption spectra. One microliter of TBE-31 ( freshly dissolved
in acetonitrile) was added to 999 AL of 20 mmol/L Tris HCl/0.005% Tween
20 (pH 8.0; final concentration of TBE-31, 0.1 mmol/L). The UV spectrum
was recorded by using a double-beam UV/VIS spectrophotometer (Hitachi
Instruments, Inc.). Then, 1 AL of DTT ( final concentration, 1 mmol/L) was
added, and the spectrum was recorded again to test for changes in
absorbance. DTT was present at the same concentration in the reference
cuvette.

Figure 2. TBEs block the induction of iNOS and induce phase 2 cytoprotective proteins. RAW264.7 mouse macrophage-like cells (A and B ) or U937 cells (B)
were treated with TBEs or CDDO-Im (Im) and IFN-g (10 ng/mL) for 18 h (A) or with compounds alone for 6 h (B ), and cell lysates were immunoblotted with iNOS,
HO-1, or tubulin antibodies. Hepa1c1c7 cells were grown for 24 h and then treated with serial dilutions of compounds for 48 h. The concentration required to double
(CD ) the specific enzyme activity of NQO1 was used to quantify inducer potency (C ). D , U937 cells were treated with TBEs or CCDO-Im for 24 h. H2DCFDA
was added for 30 min, and then the cells were challenged with 250 Amol/L tBHP for 20 min to induce the formation of ROS. The mean fluorescence intensity of
10,000 cells per group was detected by flow cytometry, and results are expressed as percent of control.

TBE-31 Prevents Liver Carcinogenesis

Figure 3. Increasing concentrations of TBEs induce differentiation, inhibit proliferation, and activate apoptosis in U937 leukemia cells. U937 cells were treated
with various concentrations of TBE-31 and CDDO-Im for 4 d, and CD11b expression was analyzed by flow cytometry (A ) or were treated with 100 nmol/L TBE-31 or
30 nmol/L CDDO-Im for 8 to 24 h, and Western blots of cell lysates were probed with Id1 and Id2 antibodies (B). To measure proliferation, cells were treated with
TBEs or Im for 3 d and then evaluated using a [3H]thymidine incorporation assay (C ). U937 cells also were treated for 24 h, and Western blots were probed with PARP
(cPARP, cleaved PARP) and tubulin antibodies to verify the induction of apoptosis (D ). A, anisomycin (positive control, 10 Ag/mL).

Tissue levels. CD-1 male mice (n = 4 per group) were gavaged
with 1 Amol TBE or CDDO-Im dissolved in DMSO or DMSO alone. Six
hours later, tissues were harvested and blood was collected into
heparinized tubes. Tissues and blood were extracted in acetonitrile,
separated by reverse phase liquid chromatography (Waters 2695 HPLC
and Waters XTerra MS C18 5-Am particle column with an 8 min 46–94%
acetonitrile gradient), and detected using a single quadrupole mass
spectrometer with electrospray ionization (Waters Micromass ZQ).
Standard curves generated by serially diluting known concentrations of
drug in control tissue extracts and Waters MassLynx 4.1 software were
used to calculate tissue levels (19). All samples were within the range of
the standards.
In vivo studies with aflatoxin. For the AFB1 adduct studies, male F344
rats (Harlan) were gavaged with TBEs or CDDO-Im dissolved in a vehicle of
10% DMSO, 10% cremophor, and 80% PBS. Forty-eight hours later, rats were
gavaged with AFB1 (25 Ag per rat) in DMSO. Rats were sacrificed 2 h after
treatment with AFB1, and DNA from flash-frozen livers was isolated and
analyzed for levels of AFB1-DNA adducts by liquid chromatography-mass
spectrometry (LC-MS) as described (20). To examine hepatic foci, rats were
gavaged with TBE-31 or CDDO-Im on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
morning for 3 successive wk. Beginning on the second week, AFB1 (25 Ag
per rat) was gavaged each Monday through Friday afternoon for 2 wk. Five
weeks after the final doses of drug and AFB1, rats were sacrificed, and
multiple sections of the left lateral lobe of the liver were fixed in acetone
(4jC) and embedded in paraffin. Liver sections were stained for expression
of glutathione S-transferase P (GST-P) positive foci and analyzed as
previously published (20).
Statistical analysis. Linear regression was used to determine if there
was a trend in the results with increasing doses of TBE-31. A Student’s t test
(Stata Corporation) was used to compare the relative efficacy of TBE-31 and
CDDO-Im for reduction of tumor burden.

Results
TBEs inhibit the production of iNOS and ROS and upregulate phase 2 enzymes. Because chronic inflammation can
drive carcinogenesis (7, 21), our primary screen for testing new
chemopreventive agents is their ability to block the production of
iNOS. In RAW264.7 macrophage-like cells stimulated with IFN-g,
0.1 to 0.3 Amol/L of all of the TBEs reduced iNOS protein, but
TBE-31 is clearly the most potent TBE and is comparable in
potency to CDDO-Im (Fig. 2A), one of the most potent known
semisynthetic derivatives of oleanolic acid (17, 20). The TBEs also
effectively reduced iNOS protein levels in RAW cells stimulated
with lipopolysaccharide (data not shown). Low nanomolar
concentrations of the TBEs and CDDO-Im also induced the
phase 2 cytoprotective proteins heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1; Fig. 2B)
and NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1; Fig. 2C) in a
variety of cells; TBE-31 is the most potent compound in the
NQO1 assay. An expected outcome of the activation of phase 2
enzymes is a reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS). In U937
cells treated with TBEs or CDDO-Im for 24 hours and then
challenged with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP) to produce ROS,
all of the TBEs reduced ROS levels by 45% to 67% compared with
control cells (Fig. 2D). TBE-31 and CDDO-Im are at least 10-fold
more potent than the other TBEs in this assay, as TBE-31 and
CDDO-Im were effective at 0.01 to 0.1 Amol/L, whereas 1 Amol/L
concentration of TBE-9, TBE-28, and TBE-30 were needed to
reduce ROS levels.
TBE-31 induces differentiation, blocks proliferation, and
induces apoptosis in U937 leukemia cells. Because CDDO-Im is

Figure 4. TBE-31 directly interacts with cysteine residues of Keap1 and blocks both the degradation of InBa and constitutive STAT3 phosphorylation in HepG2
hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Spectrophotometric analysis (A) of 0.1 mmol/L TBE-31 before (gray line ) and after (black line ) the addition of 1 mmol/L DTT. RAW cells
(B) and HepG2 cells (C ) were pretreated with TBE-31 or CDDO-Im for 24 or 2 h, respectively, stimulated with TNFa for 15 min, and then immunoblotted with
InBa and tubulin antibodies. D, HepG2 cells were also treated for 2 h and then immunoblotted with pSTAT3 and tubulin antibodies.

a potent inducer of monocytic differentiation (16), we treated U937
human leukemia cells with TBE-31 and CDDO-Im for 4 days and
then measured expression of the CD11b (CR3 complement
receptor) cell surface marker. As shown in Fig. 3A, CDDO-Im
increased expression of CD11b 2- to 4-fold, but TBE-31 increased
CD11b expression >10-fold compared with the vehicle-treated
controls. Both TBE-31 and CDDO-Im also decreased protein levels
of Id1 (Fig. 3B), a key protein that inhibits differentiation in
leukemia cells (22, 23), at the same concentrations that increased
CD11b expression. Neither TBE-31 nor CDDO-Im reduced Id2
protein levels. TBE-31 and CDDO-Im at 0.1 Amol/L also
significantly reduced proliferation of both human U937 leukemia
and RPMI 8226 myeloma cells (Fig. 3C ). At even higher
concentrations of TBE-31, PARP cleavage (Fig. 3D) and increased
Annexin V staining (data not shown) were observed in U937 cells.
In the PARP assay, TBE-31 was slightly less active than CDDO-Im,
as PARP cleavage occurred with 0.3 Amol/L of CDDO-Im but not
with TBE-31. TBE-31 also inhibited proliferation and induced
apoptosis in a variety of other human cancer cells, including Jurkat
leukemia cells, 8226 myeloma cells, MCF-7 breast cancer cells, and
A549 lung cancer cells, although higher concentrations of TBE-31
were needed to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in the
MCF-7 and A549 adherent epithelial cells than in leukemia and
myeloma cells grown in suspension (data not shown).
Targets of TBE-31. In Figs. 2 and 3, we showed that TBE-31
blocked the induction of the iNOS inflammatory protein, activated
phase 2 enzymes such as HO-1 and NQO1, inhibited proliferation,

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (16). August 15, 2008

and induced apoptosis. The multifunctional nature of TBE-31 is
similar to CDDO and its analogues (9), and both TBE-31 and CDDO
contain a,h-unsaturated carbonyl groups in their A and C rings.
These functional groups suggest that TBE-31 may undergo Michael
addition with nucleophilic targets containing reactive sulfhydryl
residues. Indeed, TBE-31 directly interacts with DTT (Fig. 4A);
adding DTT to a 100 Amol/L solution of TBE-31 at pH 8 caused
both an increase in the wavelength of maximum absorption from
242 to 268 nm and hypochromism, a decrease in the height of the
absorption peak. Interestingly, the wavelength increase at maximum absorption was only 18 nm with TBE-9 (data not shown)
versus 26 nm with TBE-31 under identical conditions. Spectroscopic examination of the reaction of TBE-31 with murine
recombinant kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1; data
not shown) revealed a virtually identical difference spectrum,
strongly suggesting that TBE-31 reacts with cysteine residues of
Keap1. Currently, detailed investigations of the structure of Michael
adducts of TBE-31 with protein targets are in progress. Because the
TBEs can form Michael adducts, it is likely they will interact with
multiple protein targets and signal transduction pathways, as has
been found with the oleanane triterpenoids (9). Although IKK is a
direct molecular target of CDDO-Im and CDDO-Me (24, 25), the
concentrations of CDDO-Im and TBE-31 that inhibited iNOS and
activated phase 2 enzymes (Fig. 2) did not block the degradation of
InBa in RAW cells (Fig. 4B). However, pretreatment with TBE-31 at
concentrations of at least 1 Amol/L inhibited the degradation of
InBa in both RAW (Fig. 4B) and HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma

cells (Fig. 4C) challenged with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) a.
Another known target of CDDO-Im is phospho-signal transducers
and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3; ref. 15), and TBE-31
reduced constitutive phospho-STAT3 levels in HepG2 cells (Fig. 4D)
after only 2 h of treatment. In contrast, pSTAT3 levels were not
affected by CDDO-Im treatment within 2 hours (Fig. 4D), although
by 24 hours, pSTAT3 levels were markedly lower with both TBE-31
and CDDO-Im (data not shown).
Tissue distribution and stability studies. The potent induction of phase 2 enzymes and the reduction in iNOS protein
(Fig. 2) by TBE-31 suggested it could be a useful drug for the
prevention of cancer. To determine appropriate target organs for
chemoprevention studies, 1-Amol doses of TBE-9, TBE-31, and
CDDO-Im were administered by gavage to male CD-1 mice
(Fig. 5A). After 6 hours, blood and tissues were harvested
and analyzed by liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy. The
highest levels of TBE-31 were detected in the liver (0.7 Amol/kg)
and pancreas (0.5 Amol/kg), but only low levels were found in the
lung and brain. The levels of TBE-31 in blood were much higher
(1 Amol/L) than with CDDO-Im (0.04 Amol/L). When TBE-31 and
CDDO-Im were incubated at 37jC in human plasma, only 41% of
the original CDDO-Im sample was present after 4 hours and only
16% could be detected 24 hours later (Fig. 5B). In contrast, 75%
and 32% of the original TBE-31 sample remained after 4 and
24 hours, respectively. Although CDDO-Im was converted to
CDDO, no new degradation products were detected from TBE-31.
To determine the optimal route of administration, mice were
given TBE-31 by gavage, i.v., or i.p. injection. TBE-31 markedly
increased expression of HO-1 protein in the liver with both i.p.
injection and gavage (Fig. 5C), and because oral administration is

preferable to i.p. injection for delivery of a drug, TBE-31 was given
orally in an in vivo carcinogenesis study.
TBE-31 reduces formation of aflatoxin-DNA adducts and
carcinogenesis in the livers of rats. Because of the similar
potency of TBE-31 and CDDO-Im (Figs. 2–4), the ability of CDDO-Im
to suppress hepatic tumorigenesis induced by AFB1 (20), and the
high levels of TBE-31 found in the liver after gavage (Fig. 5A), we first
tested whether TBE-31 could inhibit the formation of hepatic
aflatoxin-DNA adducts. Pretreatment with TBE-31 for 48 hours
significantly (P < 0.05) reduced formation of aflatoxin-N7-guanine
adducts in a dose-dependent manner, up to 85% at the highest
dose used (Fig. 6A). Both TBE-31 and CDDO-Im also significantly
(P < 0.05) increased enzyme activity of quinone reductase in the
livers of rats treated with AFB1 (data not shown). TBE-31 was more
potent than CDDO-Im in this assay, which historically underestimates chemopreventive potential against hepatic preneoplastic
lesions induced by aflatoxin (20, 26). In a short-term model of
hepatic tumorigenesis, both TBE-31 (at doses up to 60 Amol/kg) and
CDDO-Im (10 Amol/kg) were well-tolerated, as there was no weight
loss in any of these groups compared with the aflatoxin-treated rats.
Both the number (P = 0.001) and diameter (P = 0.024) of GSTP–positive foci in liver were significantly decreased with increasing
doses of TBE-31, and the focal volume percent of foci (analogous to
tumor burden) was also significantly (P < 0.005) reduced in a dosedependent manner in all treatment groups. At the highest doses of
TBE-31 (30 and 60 Amol/kg), no foci were seen (Fig. 6B). Even at the
lowest dose of 0.3 Amol TBE-31/kg, the total tumor burden of
preneoplastic GST-P–positive foci was reduced over 90%, from an
average of 1.73 in the control group to 0.15 in the treated group. At
10 Amol/kg, TBE-31 and CDDO-Im were equipotent (P = 0.6) and

or by gavage to male CD-1 mice (3–4 per group). After 6 h, livers were harvested and homogenized, and Western blots of tissue lysates were probed with HO-1
and tubulin antibodies.

almost completely prevented the development of foci with
reductions of prenoplastic lesions by >99%.

Discussion
We have shown that low nanomolar concentrations of TBE-31,
a new TBE with an acetylene group at C-8a, inhibit the induction of
the inflammatory protein, iNOS; induce the phase 2 enzymes HO-1
and NQO1 and, thus, block the production of ROS; induce
differentiation; and suppress proliferation in U937 leukemia cells.
At low micromolar concentrations, TBE-31 prevents the degradation of IKBa, reduces constitutive STAT3 phosphorylation, and
induces apoptosis. TBE-31 also blocks the ability of aflatoxin, a
known human carcinogen, to form adducts with DNA and reduces
the burden of aflatoxin-induced preneoplastic foci in liver by 90%
to 100%. It is equivalent to, or even slightly more potent than,
CDDO-Im, one of the most active compounds ever tested in these
assays, and is more stable in human plasma.
Activation of the phase 2 enzyme system to detoxify potential
carcinogens and to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress is an
emerging strategy for preventing cancer in both animals and
humans (27, 28). This cytoprotective response is regulated by
transcription factor NF-E2–related factor-2 (Nrf2), which, under
quiescent conditions, is retained and targeted for degradation
through interaction with its cytosolic repressor Keap1. In response
to environmental stimuli or small molecules that can react with
sulfhydryl groups, Keap1 loses its ability to repress Nrf2, which
subsequently undergoes nuclear translocation and binds to
antioxidant-response elements in the promoter regions of target

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (16). August 15, 2008

genes, resulting in their transcription. Although all of the TBEs
induce the phase 2 enzymes HO-1 and NQO1 (Fig. 2), TBE-31 is
clearly the most potent TBE in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 6), and it
significantly reduced formation of both AFB1-DNA adducts and
prenoplastic foci in the livers of rats challenged with aflatoxin
(Fig. 6B). The potency of TBE-31 is similar to or better than that of
the oleanane triterpenoid CDDO-Im for inhibiting hepatic tumorigenesis induced by aflatoxin, and this chemoprevention is
dependent on activation of Nrf2 (20). Notably, both CDDO-Im
and TBE-31 are 100 times more potent than has been reported for
oltipraz, which inhibits activation of aflatoxin in humans (29).
Essentially all known inducers of phase 2 enzymes modify
sulfhydryl groups (30), and covalent interactions with specific
cysteine residues on Keap1 activate Nrf2 (31). As shown in Fig. 4A,
TBE-31 directly interacts with DTT. However, Keap1 is only one of
many regulatory proteins in the cell that contains reactive
cysteines (32). Proteins in the nuclear factor-nB and Jak-Stat
pathway are also regulated by key cysteine residues, and TBE-31
prevents the degradation of IBKa and reduces levels of constitutive
pSTAT3 in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Fig. 4). There are
undoubtedly other cellular targets of the TBEs, as TBE-31 also is a
potent inducer of U937 leukemia cell differentiatsion and apoptosis
(Fig. 3); the protein targets that regulate these processes are not
known. Targeting critical protein networks regulated by reactive
cysteines is required for other multifunctional compounds such as
15-deoxy-D (12,14)-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) and is emerging as
a powerful strategy for developing chemopreventive drugs (32–34).
To identify the multiple targets of TBE-31, a biotinylated TBE, such

as has been described for the oleanane triterpenoids (24, 35),
should also be synthesized. The present studies also suggest that
TBE-31 should be tested in additional preclinical animal models to
determine whether it should be considered for further clinical
development as a chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic agent.
