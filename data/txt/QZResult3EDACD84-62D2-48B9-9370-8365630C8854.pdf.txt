ABSTRACT
Background: Activated PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway frequently occurs in metastatic
or recurrent cervical carcinomas. However, the clinical benefits of matched therapy, a
therapeutic approach targeting a specific mutational abnormality, have not yet been
established.
Methods: We analyzed the outcomes of patients with metastatic or recurrent
cervical carcinomas who had a test for PIK3CA mutation and/or PTEN loss/mutation,
and received ≥1 phase I therapeutic regimen between January 2006 and June 2013.
Results: Patients with adenocarcinoma had fewer PIK3CA mutations (14%), and
survived longer (median, 14.2 months) than those with squamous cell carcinoma
(48% and 7.2 months; p = 0.016, and 0.001, respectively). Matched therapy targeting
the activated PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway led to a favorable rate of SD ≥ 6 months/CR/
PR (53%) and significantly longer progression-free survival (median, 6.0 months)
than non-matched therapy (11% and 1.5 months; p = 0.08 and 0.026; respectively).
In patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, the presence of PIK3CA
mutations was associated with a significantly longer overall survival (median,
9.4 months) than the absence of PIK3CA mutations (median, 4.2 months; p = 0.019).
Conclusions: Matched therapy targeting the activated PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
provided meaningful clinical benefits. Thus, further evaluation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway targeted therapy is warranted, especially in metastatic or recurrent
squamous cell carcinoma.

of long-term survival after they have undergone curative
surgical resection and/or chemoradiotherapy [4, 5].
Patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancers
who are not amenable to radical local excision or curative
chemoradiotherapy, have a poor prognosis [6, 7]. Palliative
systemic therapies such as platinum-based doublets plus
an anti-angiogenic agent as the standard of care for firstline treatment yield modest survival gains of 3.7 months
[8–10]. Subsequent conventional chemotherapeutic
regimens result in increased toxicity with limited clinical

INTRODUCTION
Cancer of the uterine cervix is one of the most
common gynecologic malignancies and causes of death
worldwide [1]. In the United States, more than 12,000
women were diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2013,
and more than 4,000 patients died from this disease [2].
Squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma account for
about 95% of all cervical cancers [3]. Most patients who
are diagnosed with early-stage disease have a high rate

and June 30, 2013, had a test for PIK3CA mutation and/or
PTEN loss/mutation in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments-certified molecular diagnostic laboratory,
and received treatment in at least one phase I clinical
trial, were evaluated. Follow-up was defined as the time
of the initial office visit after the patient was referred to
the phase I clinic until death or February 28, 2014. This
study was conducted in accordance with MD Anderson’s
Institutional Review Board guidelines.

benefit [11]. The overall poor prognosis of these patients
warrants the urgency for the development of novel
therapeutic regimens [12, 13].
There are three classes of phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K) isoforms [14]. Class I PI3Ks are heterodimeric lipid
kinases composed of the p110 catalytic subunit and the
p85 regulatory subunit. Three major p110 isoforms have
been described: p110α (PIK3CA), p110β (PIK3CB), and
p110δ (PIK3CD) [15, 16]. PI3K and PTEN counterpoise
each other on conversion between phosphatidyl-inositol4-5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and phosphatidyl-inositol-3, 4,
5-trisphosphate (PIP3) [17, 18]. Upon activation through
either PIK3CA mutation or PTEN loss/mutation, PI3K
phosphorylates PIP2 to PIP3, which facilitates recruitment
and activation of AKT to initiate a cascade of downstream
signaling events including the mTOR complex, a major
downstream pathway [16]. Therefore, a regimen including
a PI3K inhibitor and/or an mTOR inhibitor can be utilized
to target PIK3CA mutation and/or PTEN loss/mutationmediated activated PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway [19].
This strategy is defined as matched therapy: a therapeutic
regimen including an agent (either as a single agent or
as a part of a combination regimen) that is known to
directly inhibit a specific mutation, and/or to inhibit its
key downstream pathways, such as treatment with a
PI3K inhibitor, an mTOR inhibitor, or these agent-based
regimens for a cancer patient carrying a PIK3CA mutation
and/or PTEN loss/mutation [20].
Our previous study and others have documented
that the activated PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is frequently
identified in patients with metastatic or recurrent cervical
cancers [21–25]. We hypothesized that cervix cancer
patients with aberrations in this pathway would achieve
clinical benefit (defined as objective response and
prolonged stable disease) when treated with PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathway targeted agents. In this article, we further
our previous study by limiting patients who only have
either squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of
the cervix in order to reach definitive conclusions, which
will be applied to facilitate future drug development by
choosing appropriate therapeutic regimens for appropriate
cancer patients. Herein we document a clear observation
of antitumor responses with acceptable toxicity from
PI3K/AKT/mTOR matched therapy, representing an
important new therapeutic strategy for a patient population
possessing limited treatment options.

Data collection

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Two individuals independently reviewed patients’
electronic medical records at MD Anderson and
crosschecked the collected data. Clinical information that
was collected included race, prior treatment history (e.g.,
surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy), date of
birth, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance
status at the initial phase I clinic visit, mutation profiling
of the tumor specimen including PIK3CA mutation and/or
PTEN loss/mutation status, phase I clinical trial therapies,
and clinical outcomes: severe adverse event (SAEs),
progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and
objective responses including complete remission (CR),
partial response (PR), and stable disease for 6 months or
longer (SD ≥ 6months).
SAEs were defined as toxic effects that were grade 3
or higher according to the National Cancer Institute
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0
or v4.0 (http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html) [26].
Clinical objective responses were evaluated according to
the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version
1.0 or 1.1 per individual study protocols [27, 28]. PFS was
defined as the interval from the date of initial treatment to
the first objective documentation of disease progression,
the time of death if it occurred, or the last date of contact
on February 28, 2014, at which time the patients’ data
were censored. OS was estimated from the date of the
initial phase I clinical trial therapy to death or the last
date of contact on February 28, 2014, at which time the
patients’ data were censored.
Enrollment of an eligible patient into a specific
phase I trial depended on the availability of the phase I
trial at the time of presentation and the preference of the
treating physician according to good clinical practice. If a
phase I trial was unsuccessful, another available phase I
trial was introduced as long as a patient was eligible and
willing to participate.

Patient selection

Statistical analyses

Consecutive patients with metastatic or recurrent
cervical carcinoma (either squamous cell carcinoma or
adenocarcinoma) who were referred to the Department of
Investigational Cancer Therapeutics (A Phase I Clinical
Trials Program) at MD Anderson between January 1, 2006,

Categorical data were described using contingency
tables. Continuously scaled measures were summarized
with descriptive statistical measures (i.e., the median with
the range), whereas PFS and OS rates were estimated
using the Kaplan-Meier method. Patients who were

carcinoma (n = 31) who had a test for PIK3CA mutation
and/or PTEN loss/mutation and underwent treatment in at
least one phase I clinical trial in the Phase I Clinical Trials
Program were included in this study. Patient characteristics
and molecular profiling are listed in Table 1. All patients
had received at least one prior systemic chemotherapeutic
regimen for metastatic or recurrent disease (median 2
regimens, range 1 to 4) and underwent molecular
marker studies in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments-certified molecular diagnostic laboratory.
Twenty-two patients were found to harbor PIK3CA
mutations and/or PTEN loss: 17 (33%) of 51 tested
patients with PIK3CA aberrations (E545K = 8, E542K = 4,
H1047L = 1, H1047R = 1, E545K and D549H  =  1,

still alive at the time of data analysis were censored at
that time. Fisher’s exact test was used to assess the
associations between categorical variables and mutation
status. Statistical inferences were based on two-sided tests
at a significance level of p < 0.05. Statistical analyses were
carried out using SPSS Statistics version 22 (IBM Inc.,
Armonk, NY).

E542K and M1043I = 1, amplification = 1); 7 (18%) of
40 tested patients with PTEN loss (n = 6) and/or mutation
(R173C = 1); and 2 patients have both of PIK3CA
mutation (E545K) and PTEN loss. Further analyses
revealed that patients with squamous cell carcinomas were
significantly younger and more likely to carry PIK3CA
mutations than those with adenocarcinomas (p = 0.034
per independent samples t-test for age and p = 0.016 per
Fisher’s exact test for PIK3CA mutations, respectively).
Approximately 20% (n = 11/55) and 36% (n = 4/11) of the
referred patients received subsequent second- and thirdline phase I trial therapies.

achieved SD ≥ 6 months/CR/PR (CR = 2, PR = 8, and
SD ≥ 6 months = 9), and the median PFS in this group
was 3.6  months (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3–5;
Figure 2A). Of 15 patients with PIK3CA mutations and/
or PTEN loss/mutations who received matched therapy,
53% achieved SD ≥ 6 months/CR/PR (CR = 1, PR = 5
and SD  ≥ 6 months = 2), and the median PFS in this
group was 6.0 months (95% CI, 3.2–8.8). These results
compared favorably with nine patients who did not receive
matched therapy targeting activated PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway: 11.1% achieved PR (PR = 1; p = 0.08), and the
median PFS in this group was 1.5 months (95% CI, 1.2–
1.8; p = 0.026; Figure 3A); as well as with seven patients
without PIK3CA mutation and PTEN loss/mutations
who received therapies targeting activated PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathway: 14% achieved PR (PR = 1, p = 0.16) and
the median PFS in this group was 1.5 months (95% CI,
0.4 – 10.6; p = 0.06).
Of 11 patients who received their second phase I
clinical trial therapy, 27% achieved SD ≥ 6 months/CR/
PR (PR = 1 and SD ≥ 6 months = 2), and the median
PFS in this group was 4.2 months (95% CI, 3.0–5.4). Of
4 patients who received their third phase I clinical trial
therapy, no patient achieved SD ≥ 6 months/CR/PR.

Severe adverse events
All patients were included for analyses of SAEs;
a total of 450 cycles of therapy were administered
according to 38 phase I clinical trials [21]. During their
first phase I trial therapy, approximately 20% of patients
(n = 11/55) experienced 19 episodes of SAEs: neutropenia
and thrombocytopenia (n = 5 each, 9%); hyponatremia
(n = 2, 4%); and hypokalemia, hypomagnesaemia,
hypophosphatemia, mucositis, fatigue, bowel perforation,
and bacterial infection (n = 1 each, 2%). During the
second phase I trial therapy, only 1 (9%) of 11 patients had
an SAE (fatigue). Subsequently, no patient experienced
an SAE before all 4 patients progressed within the initial
8 weeks of their phase I trial therapy. In patients who
received PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway targeted therapeutic
regimens, no apparent difference was observed between
patients with PI3KCA mutation and/or PTEN loss/
mutation and those without.

Overall survivals
All patients were included in survival analyses. The
median OS was 9.1 months (95% CI, 7.1–11.1 months;
Figure 2A). Patients with metastatic or recurrent
adenocarcinomas had a significantly greater median
OS of 14.2 months (95% CI, 7.8–20.6) than those with
squamous cell carcinomas (OS = 7.2 months; 95% CI,
5.3–9.1; p = 0.001), as shown in Figure 2B. Patients
with PIK3CA mutation and/or PTEN loss/mutation who
received matched therapy, achieved a median OS of
10.1 months (95% CI, 5.9–14.3), compared with those
who did not (7.7 months; 95% CI, 1.6–13.8; p =  0.43;

pathway achieved meaningful clinical benefit from a
number of novel therapeutics administered in a phase I
cancer center. Of particular interest were the objective
responses, prolonged stable disease and PFS among these
patients treated with PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway targeted
agents matching the somatic aberrations in this pathway.
We conclude from these observations that targeted therapy
among these patients with pathway potentiation is a viable
strategy for further development.

Patients with metastatic or recurrent carcinoma of
the cervix have limited therapeutic treatment options,
particularly those in whom combination chemotherapy
(without or with anti-angiogenesis agents) have been
administered [11, 29, 30]. The Gynecologic Oncology
Group (now NRG Oncology) developed phase II queues
to explore chemotherapeutic (GOG 127 series, GOG
128 series) and biological agents (GOG 227 series) in this
setting. Reflecting the poor anticipated outcomes in these

Figure 4: Kaplan-Meier plots for survivals. In Figure 4A for in patients with squamous cell carcinoma, PI3KCA mutations (in

green) were associated with a median OS of 9.4 months (n = 14; 95% CI, 8.1–10.7), significantly longer than wild-type PI3KCA (in blue)
with 4.2 months (n = 15; 95% CI, 2.2–6.2; p = 0.019). In Figure 4B for patients with adenocarcinoma, PI3KCA mutations (in green) were
associated with a median OS of 19.4 months (n = 3; 95% CI, 0–43.6), compared to wild-type PI3KCA (in blue) with 14.2 months (n = 19;
95% CI, 4–24.4; p = 0.754).

Figure 5: Kaplan-Meier plots for survivals. In Figure 5A for in patients with squamous cell carcinoma, PTEN aberrations (in green)

were associated with a median OS of 6 months (n=3; 95% CI, 2–10), similar to PTEN intact (in blue) with 7 months (n = 21; 95% CI,
3.1–10.9; p = 0.762). In Figure 5B for patients with adenocarcinoma, PTEN aberrations (in green) were associated with a median OS of
11.3 months (n = 4; 95% CI, 0–22.6), similar to PTEN intact (in blue) with 15.7 months (n = 16; 95% CI, 7.1–24.3; p = 0.791).

higher prevalence of PIK3CA mutations. However, they
displayed lower antitumor activity to currently available
phase I clinical trials at MD Anderson associated with
significantly shorter OS than patients with metastatic or
recurrent adenocarcinoma of the cervix. Second, matched
therapy targeting the activated PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
in patients with metastatic or recurrent squamous cell
carcinoma of the cervix led to a favorably higher rate

patient cohorts, the statistical decision rules were powered
to evaluate “inactive” therapy at ≤ 15% for chemotherapy
and ≤ 10% response and/or ≤ 10% non-progression at
6 months, respectively. This provides context upon which
to examine the findings in this study.
Several observations are of note. In general, patients
with metastatic or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma
of the cervix were significantly younger, and had a

of SD ≥ 6 months/CR/PR as well as significantly longer
PFS and OS than non-matched therapy. However, in
patients with metastatic or recurrent adenocarcinoma
of the cervix, there was no significant difference in OS
associated with matched therapy in spite of a higher
rate of SD  ≥  6  months/CR/PR and significantly longer
PFS, which might be owing to at least three potential
factors: lower prevalence of the activated PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathway, intrinsic sensitivity to novel phase I
trial therapy available at MD Anderson phase I service,
and the presence of PIK3CA mutation and/or PTEN loss/
mutation that cannot stratify for aggressiveness of disease.
Third, PIK3CA mutation, but not PTEN loss/mutation,
was associated with significantly longer OS, indicating
the differential effects of these genetic aberrations on
sensitivity to matched therapy, as well as matched patients
and the preferential choices of the treating physicians in
the Phase I Clinical Trials Program, MD Anderson for
assigning patients to matched therapy.
Of 136 patients with PIK3CA-mutation and/or
PTEN-loss/mutation advanced solid tumors seen in our
phase I clinic, 25% achieved SD ≥ 6 months/CR/PR
(95%CI, 0.18–0.33) after receiving matched therapy
targeting the activated PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, and
a median PFS of 2.5 months (95% CI, 1.8–3.2) [31].
These outcomes were significantly lower than those
reported in the current study of patients with PIK3CAmutation and/or PTEN-loss/mutation metastatic or
recurrent carcinoma receiving matched therapy. Several
confounding factors might have contributed to these
differences. Almost half of the patients with metastatic
or recurrent cervical carcinoma, especially those with
squamous cell carcinoma, presented with PIK3CA
mutation and/or PTEN loss/mutation, and this proportion
was significantly higher in patients with advanced solid
tumors (48% versus 22%, p = 0.002), suggesting that
the activated PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is a driving
mechanism for the survival of cervical carcinoma cells.
Another factor is that concurrent mutations or specific
molecular profiles might be more important than a single
gene mutation. PIK3CA mutation was more prevalent in
patients with KRAS mutation than in patients with wildtype KRAS [31], whereas in this report, a low frequency
of KRAS mutation was found in metastatic or recurrent
cervical carcinomas, and in squamous cell carcinomas
specifically, no KRAS mutation was identified in any of the
26 tested patients (Table 1). Since PIK3CA mutation and/
or PTEN loss/mutation with simultaneous KRAS mutation
were associated with significantly lower antitumor activity
and shorter PFS than PIK3CA mutation and/or PTEN
loss/mutation without simultaneous KRAS mutation, two
or more coexisting mutations constitute different classes
of mutation profiles that predict responses to various
biologically targeting agents and/or their combinations
and render matched therapy more complicated than
expected. When developing efficacious regimens to target
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the activated PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, metastatic or
recurrent squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix might
be an appropriate clinical model to be tested in early-phase
clinical trials because of their high prevalence of PIK3CA
mutation and/or PTEN loss/mutation as previously
reported [15, 32–35] and their lack of simultaneous KRAS
mutation, in agreement with the hypothesis that coexisting
KRAS mutation become resistant to regimens targeting the
activated PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.
When considering the clinical relevance of our
findings, several limitations should be kept in mind.
First, matched therapy includes not only phase I clinical
trials of a single agent targeting the activated PI3K/
AKT/mTOR pathway, but also phase I clinical trials
of an agent targeting this pathway in combination with
other biologically targeted agents or conventional
chemotherapeutic agents. The importance of using an
agent to target the activated PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
might be overestimated since tumor control might be
induced by simultaneous inhibition of other key targets
and/or processes by the combination regimens. Second,
patients with poor clinical outcomes may have been
selectively excluded from being referred to a phase I trial
because of rapid tumor progression, poor performance
status, insufficient organ function, severe comorbidity,
economic issues, and inaccessibility of treatment. Third,
molecular studies of mutation profiles were usually
conducted on archival tumor specimens whenever
available, regardless of whether the specimens had been
treated in a phase I clinical trial. Finally, we had a limited
sample size available for subgroup analyses, which
confounded the ability to validate statistical significance
in category assessment. Therefore, conclusions from this
retrospective study should be considered preliminary
evidence to generate hypotheses, which require further
validation in larger prospective studies.
In conclusion, our results showed that almost half
of the patients with metastatic or recurrent squamous cell
carcinoma of the cervix had PIK3CA mutation and/or
PTEN loss/mutation without coexisting KRAS mutation,
providing an appropriate patient population to the test
efficacy of a regimen including a single agent targeting
the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway or a combination regimen
with either another biologically targeted agent and/or
conventional chemotherapeutic agent. Matched therapy
targeting a specific mutation has provided apparent
clinical benefits for cancer patients. Complicated mutation
profiles might be more important and useful than a single
gene mutation in predicting antitumor activity and clinical
efficacy to a specific regimen [36–40]. Therefore, future
development and evaluation of novel regimens targeting
the activated PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway for the purpose
of translating high antitumor activity to prolonged survival
benefit is warranted in larger prospective clinical trials for
the treatment cervical carcinoma, especially squamous cell
carcinoma.
