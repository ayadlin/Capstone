ABSTRACT
Estrogenic modulation of pain is an exceedingly complex phenomenon. However,
whether estrogen is involved in discogenic low back pain still remains unclear. Here,
immunoreactivity staining technique was used to examine the expression level of
the estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ) and a pain related neuropeptide, Substance P
in the lumbar intervertebral discs to analyze the relationship between the ERs and
Substance P. Nucleus pulposus tissues of 23 elderly female patients were harvested
during spinal surgeries and made to detect the immunoreactivity staining of ERα,
ERβ and Substance P. The colocalization and intensities of ERs and Substance P
were explored and evaluated respectively. The correlations between changes of ERα,
ERβ and Substance P were also assessed. Our results revealed that Substance P
colocalized with ERα and ERβ both in cytoplasm and nucleus of the nucleus pulposus
cells. HSCORE analysis indicated that Substance P negatively correlated with both
ERα and ERβ expression. Collectively, the crosstalk between ERs and Substance P
might exist in the disc tissue. Estrogen-dependent pain mechanism might partly be
mediated through ERs and Substance P in the nucleus pulposus of the elderly females.
Estrogen and its receptors might be drug targets in discogenic low back pain diseases.

INTRODUCTION

The intervertebral disc (IVD) related pain is a
significant proportion in cases of chronic back pain [7],
imparting a large socioeconomic burden on the healthcare
system. However, the mechanism of discogenic low back
pain remains unclear [8, 9]. Some investigations showed
the involvement of estrogen on IVD health [10]. Besides,
the estrogen decrease during menopause contributes to the
progressive decrease of the IVD height [11]. The estrogen
receptors (ERs), ERα and ERβ, are the main mediators of
estrogen action. ERβ gene expression has been detected
in human IVD annulus cells [12], but the expression of
ERα and the relationship between estrogen receptors and
discogenic pain have not been established.
Substance P, secreted by nerves and inflammatory
cells, is a tachykinin that serves as a neurotransmitter and a

Recently, estrogen was indicated to play an
important role in pain modulation [1]. Low back pain was
commonly reported after menopause and suggested to
be linked to estrogen in women. However, observational
studies examining exogenous estrogen’s influence on back
symptoms provided mixed results. Some clinical studies
examining relationships between exogenous estrogen use
and back pain symptoms reported a negative effect [2-4],
whereas, a favorable effect [5] and no clear association
[6] has also been indicated. The mechanisms by which
estrogen modulates back pain appear to be highly
complex.

sensory marker related to pain [13], and might be involved
in the inflammation pain of several tissues [14-16].
Substance P have been also described within the lumbar
IVD in humans. Hence, IVD might be a pain generator
[17]. Meanwhile, the influence of estrogen on the
Substance P expressions in the synovium of osteoarthritis
joints has been reported, which provided valuable insights
into the involvement of estrogen in chronic osteoarthritis
pain [18]. In this study, the relationship between the
expressions of estrogen receptor and Substance P were
investigated in IVD tissue.

and Substance P was identified in the native chondrocytelike cells of the nucleus pulposus tissue in IVD. Control
immunohistochemistry study revealed that a brown
coloration as a positive immunoreactivity of ERα, ERβ
and Substance P in the nucleus pulposus cells of the
elderly men. No staining was detected when antibody
was pre-incubated with a blocking peptide (Figure 1). As
shown in Figure 2, both cytoplasmic and nuclear staining
of ERα, ERβ and Substance P immunoreactivity were
observed in the nucleus pulposus cells of the female.

Correlation analysis between changes of ERs and
Substance P in the nucleus pulposus

such as bone and articular cartilage [19, 20]. Much more
prevalence of chronic pain conditions in women than
men suggested a possible link between estrogen and
pain pathogenesis [21]. However, the role of estrogen in
regulating nociception remains unclear. Thus, the present
study aimed to evaluate whether a possible correlation exit
between ERs and Substance P in human IVD tissue. The
data indicated that Substance P colocalized with both ERα
and ERβ in the nucleus pulposus of the elderly females.
HSCORE analysis showed that the change of Substance
P protein staining was negatively associated with that of
ERα and ERβ protein. Estrogen might directly regulate
pain in IVD through ERs. ERs were partly involved in
intervertebral discogenic pain in the elderly women.
Some literature showed that menopause can
accelerate IVD aging. Estrogen can prevent the

Coexpression of ERs and Substance P in human
nucleus pulposus indicated that there might exit correlation
between them. To determine the potential relationship
among them, correlation analysis was performed (Figure
4). HSCORE value of Substance P staining negatively
correlated with both ERα (r = -0.807, P < 0.01, Figure 3a)
and ERβ (r = -0.884, P < 0.01, Figure 3b) HSCORE data.

DISCUSSION
It has been reported that estrogen could influence
the metabolism of the IVD and associated structures

degeneration and preserve the health of the IVD. Estrogen
deficiency might induce disc degeneration in postmenopausal women and produce low back pain associated
with disc degeneration [22]. The presentation of ERα
and ERβ in nucleus pulposus in our study confirmed
that effects of estrogen on IVD metabolism could be
direct. The influence of estrogen might be cell- and site
specific [23, 24]. 17β-estradiol increased the binding
of muscimol to GABA-A-receptors in the female rat
spinal cord and decreased the contents of Substance P

[25]. Estradiol could exert antinociceptive effects via an
interaction with α-2 receptors and serotonin receptors in
a rat model of inflammatory hyperalgesia [26]. In studies
on either ERα or ERβ knockout mice, the sex difference
in basal mechanical pain threshold and inflammatory
hypersensitivity was eliminated suggesting a fundamental
role of ERα and ERβ in nociception in female mice
[27]. Both ERα and ERβ appeared to be involved in
pain transmission and modulation but might be acting at
distinct levels of the pain pathways [28]. However, the

substantial contribution of estrogen to the IVD related
pain remains unclear, although hormonal factors are
generally associated with chronic musculoskeletal pain in
women [29-34]. Osteoarthritis (OA) is also more common
in women after menopause. As for female IVD, females
might be more susceptible to disc degeneration than males.
MR-based disc degeneration grading study of the elderly
subjects demonstrated that females had more severe disc
degeneration than males at all lumbar levels [35]. Clinical
studies also noted that women seem to be more susceptible
to the deterioration of spine [36]. A randomized, placebocontrolled, clinical trial reported that estrogen-alone use
in postmenopausal women could reduce the frequency of
joint pain [21]. In women with breast cancer, the arthralgia
related to aromatase inhibitor therapy has been noted [37].
Our study demonstrated that Substance P was negatively
associated with that of ERα and ERβ protein in IVD.
Estrogen-dependent pain mechanism might be mediated
through ERs in the nucleus pulposus of females. A novel
estrogen-dependent mechanism should be studied further
in chronic musculoskeletal pain, including pain generated
from IVD.
Colocalization of Substance P with both ERα and
ERβ in the nucleus pulposus of females were demonstrated
in our study. There might be crosstalk between Substance P
and ERs. It has been reported that Substance P expression
increased in the painful degenerate IVD [38]. Some study
also reported that estradiol could mediate sex differences
in formalin-evoked substance P release in rats [39]. In the
synovium of OA joints, estrogen might partly influences
intraarticular neurogenic inflammation by modulating
the expressions of Substance P [18]. 17β-estradiol could
decrease the contents of Substance P in female rats [25].
Therefore, we speculated that estrogen might influence the
expression and/or the release of Substance P through ERs
in IVD. Substance P can trigger neurogenic inflammation,
including vasodialtion, plasma extravasation and mast cell
degranulation, thereby leading to hyperalgia [40]. The
peripheral blood level of Substance P increased in women
with burns [41], whiplash injury [42], femoral neck
fracture [43], and complex regional pain syndrome [44]. In
the synovium of OA joints, estrogen might partly influence
intraarticular neurogenic inflammation by modulating the
expressions of Substance P [18]. Ovarectomy could induce
hyperalgesia, and treating with estrogen could counterbalance the lost of ovaries [45-47]. The present study
also support an anti-nociceptive role for estrogen in pain
sensitivity in IVD tissue. It has been demonstrated that
exogenous estrogen therapy attenuates the hyperalgesic
state in ovariectomized animals, but its mechanism should
be fully clarified, especially in IVD tissue.
Several limitations should be noted in the present
study. First, healthy disc tissue was not included in
this study. The expression features of ERα, ERβ and
Substance P might be different between healthy and
pathologic status. Second, Semiquantitative assessment
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of immunohistochemical results is highly subjective.
Although both investigators used the same grading
in our study, there also has a potential for subjective
misinterpretation. Third, there was lack of pain assessment
related to the findings in the present study. Therefore,
future studies using a larger sample size on the ERα, ERβ
and Substance P expression related to pain assessment
should provide more meaningful data.
In summary, ERα, ERβ and Substance P are
expressed in human IVD tissue of the elderly woman.
Substance P colocalized with both ERα and ERβ in the
nucleus pulposus of woman. Substance P expression level
negatively correlated with that of both ERα and ERβ.
Estrogen might directly regulate pain in IVD through
ERs. Estrogen-dependent pain mechanism might partly
be mediated through the crosstalk between ERs and
Substance P in the nucleus pulposus of the elderly females.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and samples harvest
Human IVD tissue was obtained at surgery, with
informed consent of the patient or relatives. Study
protocols were approved by the Institutional Review
Board and the local Ethics Committee of our institution.
Each subject was identified only by number. Twentythree elderly female patients(mean age: 69.3± 2.6 years;
ranging 65-77 years), who underwent disc excision
and/or posterior lumbar interbody fusion for lumbar
disc degeneration and discogenic low back pain were
selected. All women were in post-menopause status.
Discography was used for diagnosis. Patients with tumor,
infection, immunological and endocrine disease were
excluded. All samples were obtained from L4/5 or L5/S1
levels. No multiple disc levels were used in the present
study. After removing the herniated disc tissue, nucleus
pulposus tissues at the center of an intervertebral disc were
harvested during spinal surgeries as previously reported
[48, 49]. Cartilaginous endplates and annulus fibrosus
tissues were discarded to ensure the identity of the nucleus
pulposus tissue as much as possible [50-55]. The nucleus
pulposus tissue was immediately washed with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) and was routinely fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde followed by embedded in paraffin
for immunostaining.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed according
to our previously described procedure [56, 57]. Paraffin
sections (5µm thick) of the IVD tissue were treated with
xylene to remove paraffin and rehydrated in graded alcohol
baths followed by three rinses with PBS. Slides were

immunostained with the streptavidin-biotin peroxidase
(SABC) technique. The IVD tissues of the elderly men
were used as the control for ERα, ERβ and Substance P
expression. Control experiments were incubated with the
antibody pre-incubated with a blocking peptide.
Antigen retrieval was performed by heating the
sections in 10 mmol/L citrate buffer (pH 6.0) up to 95
o
C for 10 min and allowing them to cool down to room
temperature for 20 min. Then sections were incubated
in 1% H2O2 for 15 min for blocking the endogenous
peroxidase activity. After preincubation with 5%
normal goat serum (Vector, S-1000) for 30 min at room
temperature, sections were incubated overnight at 4oC
at room temperature with rabbit polyclonal antibody of
ERα (Santa Cruz, sc-543, 1:100 dilution), ERβ (Abcam,
ab3576, 1:100 dilution) and Substance P (Boster, BA0126,
1:100 dilution). Then sections were incubated with the
corresponding biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector,
BA-1000), applied for 30 min at a dilution of 1:200,
followed by a triple wash in PBS. Finally, the sections
were incubated in ABC complex (Vectastain ABC kit,
Vector Cat#PK-6100) for 30 min at room temperature.
Staining was visualized with DAB peroxides substrate
solution for 3 min, followed by rinsing in distilled water
briefly. The slides were dehydrated in graded ethanol,
cleared in xylene, and mounted with Permount medium
after counterstaining with Gill’s hematoxylin solution for
3 min.

dark. The nucleus were visualized blue using a filter 330380 nm and positive labeled expression with green by
filter 465-495 nm, with red by filter 530-600 nm. Control
staining was performed on adjacent serial sections and
consisted in replacing the primary antibody with 0.1%
BSA in PBS.

Semi-quantitative analysis of ERs and Substance
P staining intensities
The intensities of ERα, ERβ and Substance P
immunoreactivity were semi-quantitatively evaluated
using the following intensity categories: 0, no staining;
1, weak but detectable staining; 2, moderate or distinct
staining; 3, intense staining. We normalized images
background and variability in staining based on the
negative control of the samples. For every sample, after
summing the percentages of cells that stained at each
intensity group and multiplying that by the weighted
intensity of the staining, a HSCORE value was derived.
The formula HSCORE = Σii×Pi, where i represents the
intensity scores, and Pi is the corresponding percentage of
the cells, was used for calculation. Three tissue sections
from each IVD sample were randomly obtained and
five randomly selected areas were evaluated for every
tissue slide under the microscope with 200×original
magnification. The percentage of the cells at each
intensity group within these areas was determined by two
investigators blinded to the type of the IVD tissues. The
average score was used.

Dual label immunofluorescence staining
Colocalization of ERs and Substance P was explored
using immunofluorescence study. As we previously
described [58], the slides were immersed to a boil
(99oC~100oC) in 0.01M sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0)
for 10 minutes. After the nonspecific binding was blocked
with normal 5% goat serum (Vector, S-1000), slides
were incubated overnight with a rabbit anti-Substance P
antibody (Boster, BA0126, 1:100 dilution), followed by
the Alexa Fluor® 594 Goat anti-rabbit (Invitrogen, A11037)
incubation 30 min at room temperature in dark, washed
with PBS 3*3 times. Then added rabbit anti-ERα antibody
(Santa Cruz, sc-543, 1:100 dilution) incubating 30min
at room temperature in dark, followed by Alexa Fluor®
488 Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (Invitrogen, Cat:A11034)
fluorescent conjugated secondary antibodies for 30min,
washed with PBS 3*3min times. Finally, the slides were
mounted with 2-(4-amidinophenyl)-6-indolecarbamidine
dihydrochloride (DAPI) mounting solution (5 µg/ml)
(Invitrogen, P36935). As for the rabbit anti-ERβ antibody
(Abcam Inc., ab3576, 1:100 dilution), incubated overnight
at 4oC. On the following day, the slides were washed with
PBS and then incubated with Alexa Fluor® 488 Goat AntiRabbit IgG 30min at room temperature, then washed with
PBS and followed by DAPI staining as the same before.
All sildes were evaluated by 50i Nikon microscope in

Statistical analysis
Data from ERα, ERβ and Substance P
immunohistochemistry scores in the IVD tissue were
normally distributed as tested by Kruskal-Wallis (H)
test. Quantitative data regarding HSCORE analysis
are presented as mean ± SD. The correlations between
changes of ERα, ERβ, ERα/ERβ and Substance P were
assessed by means of Pearson’s correlation coefficient
test. A P value of < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant. Statistical analysis was performed using the
SPSS 17.0 statistical package (SPSS Inc., USA).
