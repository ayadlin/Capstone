BACKGROUND: The purpose of the current study was to describe the outcomes of patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-overexpressed=amplified (HER21) early breast cancer who received adjuvant or neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based
therapy and were subsequently retreated with trastuzumab for metastatic disease. METHODS: A total of 353 patients with metastatic
HER21 breast cancer who were treated with trastuzumab as part of their first-line treatment for metastatic disease were identified. A
total of 75 patients had received adjuvant or neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy for early breast cancer, and 278 had not. Clinical outcomes of patients who had or had not received prior trastuzumab were compared using Cox proportional hazards regression
and logistic regression analyses. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: The clinical benefit (complete
response, partial response, or stable disease of  6 months) rates were 71% in the group who did not receive prior trastuzumab and
39% in the group previously treated with trastuzumab. The adjusted odds ratios were 0.28 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.130.59; P 5.0009) for clinical benefit rates and 0.39 (95% CI, 0.18-0.82; P 5.038) for objective (complete or partial) response rates. In
the univariate analysis, the median overall survival rate was longer in the group who did not receive prior trastuzumab (36 months vs
28 months) (hazards ratio, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.07-2.01 [P 5.022]). The multivariate analysis found no significant difference in overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: When treated with trastuzumab for metastatic disease, patients with HER21 breast cancer without prior exposure to trastuzumab were found to have superior clinical outcomes to those with prior exposure. Prior trastuzumab exposure should
be considered in treatment algorithms and in HER2-targeted clinical trial enrollment for metastatic disease. Cancer 2014;120:1932–8.

INTRODUCTION
The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, also known as ERBB2) gene encodes a growth factor tyrosine kinase receptor that belongs to a family of 4 transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases that mediate cell growth, differentiation, and survival.1 The HER2 protein is overexpressed in 20% to 25% of invasive breast cancers,2-4 and its
overexpression portends an unfavorable prognosis because of its inherently more aggressive biology.5,6 HER2 protein
overexpression or HER2 gene amplification is associated with an increased metastatic potential and a decreased overall survival rate.2 Previously, the most effective adjuvant systemic regimen for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer was a
combination of anthracyclines and taxanes.7 To our knowledge, trastuzumab was the first humanized monoclonal antibody that directly targeted the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor.8 Some of trastuzumab’s antitumor effects are
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, inhibition of HER2 extracellular domain cleavage, activation of phosphatase
and tensin homolog, and inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase=AKT survival signaling.9
Trastuzumab was first approved for the treatment of metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer because it provided remarkable improvements in response rate, time to disease progression, duration of response, and overall survival when
combined with chemotherapy.10 Because of its usefulness in the metastatic setting, trastuzumab was studied in the

adjuvant setting, in which it resulted in improvements in
clinical outcomes when given in combination with or after
chemotherapy. Five randomized, phase 3 clinical trials
demonstrated significant improvements in disease-free
and overall survival rates when trastuzumab was administered in conjunction with adjuvant chemotherapy for
patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer.11-14
The integration of trastuzumab-based therapy into the
adjuvant setting changed the course of the disease in
women with HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer.
Despite this success, trastuzumab resistance still represents a clinical challenge. The majority of patients with
metastatic breast cancer whose disease initially responds
to trastuzumab develop resistance within 1 year of treatment initiation, and approximately 5% to 15% of
patients with HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer
who receive adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy develop
recurrent disease.15-17
Several clinical trials have shown clinical benefit in
continuing or resuming trastuzumab-based treatment despite disease progression during or after treatment with
trastuzumab, suggesting that resistance may be partially
overcome by changing chemotherapy agents in the metastatic setting.18,19 The results of the Retreatment after HErceptin Adjuvant (RHEA) study demonstrated that in
patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, the
combination of trastuzumab plus a taxane is clinically efficacious as a first-line treatment at the time of disease recurrence after trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy.20 There is
also evidence indicating that patients previously treated
with trastuzumab and lapatinib derive clinical benefit when
retreated for metastatic disease with trastuzumab-based
therapy.21 Despite the identification of trastuzumab resistance as a significant clinical problem, continued blockade
of the HER2 pathway at the time of disease progression has
been used in the clinic as an efficacious treatment strategy.
To the best of our knowledge, limited information is
available outlining the outcomes of patients who receive
adjuvant trastuzumab for HER2-positive early-stage breast
cancer and then go on to develop metastatic HER2positive disease and receive retreatment with trastuzumab.
The current study reviewed the outcomes of patients who
were treated with trastuzumab in the first-line metastatic
setting and evaluated whether these outcomes differed
between patients who received trastuzumab in the adjuvant=neoadjuvant setting and those who did not.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We conducted a retrospective review of patients with
HER2-positive breast cancer treated at The University of

Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center with trastuzumab as
part of their first-line treatment for metastatic disease.
Patients were identified through the Breast Cancer Management System database, which is managed by the
Department of Breast Medical Oncology at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Patients were
included in the analysis if they met the following criteria:
female sex, age  18 years, diagnosis of metastatic HER2positive breast cancer between April 1998 and November
2010, and treatment with trastuzumab-based therapy in
the first-line metastatic setting. Patients who had previously received neoadjuvant or adjuvant trastuzumabbased therapy for HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer
were included. A total of 513 patients with HER2positive metastatic breast cancer were evaluated during
the time period. Of the 513 patients identified, 160
patients had presented with de novo stage IV HER2positive breast cancer and were analyzed separately. A total
of 353 patients had a history of stage I to III HER2positive breast cancer and were included in the primary
analysis. These 353 eligible patients were stratified based
on whether they did or did not receive prior (ie, adjuvant
or neoadjuvant) trastuzumab-based therapy, and clinical
outcomes were evaluated accordingly.
The Institutional Review Board at The University of
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center approved the retrospective review of medical records for the current study.
The primary tumors were staged according to the 6th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer criteria.22 The HER2 status of primary tumors was
determined using immunohistochemistry and=or fluorescence in situ hybridization.23 Tumors were classified as
HER2 positive if the protein was overexpressed on immunohistochemistry (score of 31) or if the HER2 gene was
amplified on fluorescence in situ hybridization (HER2=chromosome 17 centromere [CEP17] ratio of  2).15
The nuclear grade and estrogen receptor and progesterone
receptor expression were recorded from each patient’s pathology reports. A tumor was considered to be positive for
estrogen receptor or progesterone receptor if the respective
immunostaining showed expression in at least 10% of
cells. The grading and histologic classification of tumors
were based on the modified Black and Speer nuclear grading system24 and World Health Organization criteria,25
respectively.
Patients were followed according to the practice
guidelines in place at the time. We reviewed the medical
records to determine the patients’ response to first-line
therapy using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors,26 dates of first-line treatment, and survival

status. The United States Social Security Death Index was
also used to identify deceased patients. If a patient had
died, the date of last follow-up was considered as the date
of death. Overall survival was calculated from the date of
the initiation of first-line trastuzumab-based therapy for
metastatic disease until the time of death or last followup. Objective response was defined as a complete or partial response. Clinical benefit was defined as complete
response, partial response, or stable disease for at least 6
months. For patients with metastasis in > 1 organ, the
first site of distant metastasis was defined by prespecified
importance in the following order: brain, liver, lung,
pleura, bone, and other. The “other” category included
lymph node and soft tissue metastasis.
Statistical Analysis

Logistic regression was used to assess the association
between prior trastuzumab use and response to trastuzumab in the metastatic setting. The Kaplan-Meier method
was used to estimate survival curves from the initiation of
trastuzumab treatment in the metastatic setting. The Cox
proportional hazards regression model was used to assess
the association between prior trastuzumab use and overall
survival. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to compare response rates, clinical benefit rates,
and median overall survival durations between the group
of patients who had received prior trastuzumab and the
group who had not. The sample sizes for the multivariate
analyses were slightly smaller than those of the corresponding univariate analyses due to missing data for some
of the covariates included in the statistical models. Analyses were conducted using the SAS software (SAS Institute
Inc, Cary, NC); statistical significance was defined as
P < .05.
RESULTS
Of the 353 patients eligible for analysis, 75 had received
trastuzumab in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting and
278 had not. Table 1 shows the baseline patient characteristics stratified by prior trastuzumab exposure. The median interval from the time of diagnosis of first metastasis
to the initiation of treatment with trastuzumab in the
metastatic setting was 20.5 days (range, 0.0 days-210.0
days) in patients without prior trastuzumab exposure and
23.0 days (range, 0.0 days-435.0 days) in patients with
prior exposure. The number of deaths was 190 among
patients without prior trastuzumab exposure (68%) and
50 in the group with prior exposure (67%). The median
age at diagnosis with metastatic disease was 50 years
(range, 25 years-93 years) in patients without prior

cyclophosphamide; or doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Seventy-five patients had received adjuvant or neoadjuvant trastuzumab in combination with paclitaxel or
docetaxel, with continuous weekly administration of trastuzumab for 52 weeks. The majority of patients in both
groups had initial tumors with a high nuclear grade at the
time of presentation. The percentages of premenopausal
and postmenopausal patients were roughly equal in both
groups. The percentages of hormone receptor-negative
breast cancer were slightly different: 46% in the group
without prior trastuzumab exposure and 57% in the
group with prior exposure.
Of the 353 patients, 57 (16%) were excluded from
the response analysis due to nonmeasurable disease (39
patients) or lack of response data (18 patients). Patients
were considered not evaluable for response if they had
received radiotherapy before or concurrently with chemotherapy; undergone surgical resection of the metastatic
site of disease before receiving chemotherapy; or had isolated metastasis to bone, pleura, ascitic fluid, or skin only
(22 patients). In addition, patients with brain metastases
who had received whole-brain radiotherapy or surgery
before systemic chemotherapy were excluded from the
response analysis (17 patients). Of the 296 patients
included in the response analysis, a higher objective
response rate (51% vs 29%) and clinical benefit rate (71%
vs 39%) were observed in the group of patients without
prior trastuzumab exposure compared with the group
with prior exposure. After controlling for age, disease-free
interval, postmenopausal status, stage of disease, hormone
receptor status, and nuclear grade using multiple logistic
regression, the adjusted odds ratios were 0.39 (95%

confidence interval [95% CI], 0.18-0.82; P 5 .038) for
the objective response rate and 0.28 (95% CI, 0.13-0.59;
P 5 .0009) for the clinical benefit rate.
The median overall survival was 36 months in the
group without prior exposure to trastuzumab (278
patients) and 28 months in the group with prior exposure
(75 patients) (hazards ratio [HR], 1.47; 95% CI, 1.07-2.01
[P 5 .022]) (Fig. 1). No significant difference was noted
when the HR was adjusted for age, disease-free interval,
menopausal status, stage of disease, hormone receptor status, and nuclear grade (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.86-1.73
[P 5 .27]). The median overall survival from the time of
the original diagnosis of stage I to III disease in the 353
patients was 73 months (range, 65 months-81 months).
The analyses were repeated to include patients who
presented with de novo stage IV HER2-positive breast cancer (160 patients). As expected, the overall response and
clinical benefit rates followed similar trends when the analysis included this group of trastuzumab-naive patients.
Higher rates of objective response (57% vs 29%) and clinical benefit (76% vs 39%) were observed in the group without prior trastuzumab exposure compared with the group
with prior exposure. The adjusted odds ratios were 0.37
(95% CI, 0.17-0.79; P 5 .010) for the objective response
rate and 0.28 (95% CI, 0.13-0.58; P < .0001) for the clinical benefit rate. When overall survival was analyzed to
include the patients with de novo stage IV disease, the median overall survival was 39 months in the group with no
prior trastuzumab exposure and 28 months in the group
with prior exposure (HR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.21-2.23
[P 5 .0024]) (Fig. 2). After adjustments for age, diseasefree interval, menopausal status, stage of disease, hormone
receptor status, and nuclear grade, the HR for overall survival was 1.23 (95% CI, 0.87-1.75; P 5 .24).
For the majority of patients, the liver was the first
site of metastatic disease; there was a lower rate of liverfirst metastasis in the group previously exposed to trastuzumab compared with the group without prior exposure
(44% vs 25%) (Table 1). Of the patients categorized as
having brain-first metastasis (30 patients), 11 patients also
had liver metastases (2 patients in the group with prior exposure and 9 patients in the group without prior exposure). A log-rank test was performed to determine
whether the site of distant metastatic disease influenced
overall survival (Fig. 3). Patients with brain metastases
had the shortest median survival (17 months), followed
by patients with metastases to the lung or pleura (31
months) and those with metastases to the liver (32
months). Next, this analysis was performed with patients
stratified according to whether they had received prior

without prior trastuzumab exposure had a significantly longer median survival (33 months) than patients with liver
metastases who had received trastuzumab in the adjuvant or
neoadjuvant setting for early-stage breast cancer (19
patients) (19 months) (HR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2-3.6
[P 5 .011]) (Fig. 4). Patients with brain metastases who had
not received prior trastuzumab also had a longer median
overall survival; however, 30 patients were included in the
analysis (17 without and 13 with prior trastuzumab exposure). This sample was not large enough for a valid analysis.
DISCUSSION
In the current retrospective analysis of patients with
HER2-positive breast cancer who received front-line trastuzumab-based therapy for metastatic disease, we
observed that trastuzumab-naive patients had higher overall response and clinical benefit rates compared with
patients who had received trastuzumab in the adjuvant or
neoadjuvant setting.
To the best of our knowledge, the topic of whether
prior trastuzumab exposure affects clinical outcomes when
patients develop disease recurrence and are treated with
trastuzumab-based therapy in the first-line metastatic setting has been largely unexplored. The findings of the current study indicate that patients previously exposed to
trastuzumab derive less clinical benefit from trastuzumab
in the metastatic setting compared with trastuzumab-naive
patients. This supports other observations that disease recurrence after the use of adjuvant trastuzumab is associated

with a lower likelihood of prolonged trastuzumab use in
the advanced=metastatic setting.27
Novel therapies targeting HER2 are moving rapidly
to the clinic, and the selection and sequencing of these
therapies has become more challenging. Several recent clinical trials for the treatment of patients with advanced
HER2-positive breast cancer highlight the evolving treatment options for women with this disease. In the Clinical
Evaluation of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab (CLEOPATRA) trial, which established docetaxel, trastuzumab,
and pertuzumab as the first-line regimen in patients with
metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, only 10% of the
population had prior trastuzumab exposure, and a diseasefree interval of  12 months was required for eligibility.28
Nevertheless, it is important to note that the patients with
prior trastuzumab exposure derived benefits similar to
those who were trastuzumab-naive. In contrast, all patients
enrolled in the EGF104900 study were heavily pretreated;
these patients had received a median of 4 prior regimens,
the majority of which were trastuzumab-based (perhaps
reflecting a higher rate of HER2-positive disease). Both a
progression-free survival and overall survival benefit were
demonstrated when patients with heavily pretreated metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer were treated with a
combination of lapatinib and trastuzumab compared with
lapatinib monotherapy.29,30 Finally, in the EMILIA
(NCT00829166) study, which established adotrastuzumab emtansine as the optimal treatment in the
second-line setting, all patients had been previously
exposed to and had retained potential sensitivity to trastuzumab.31 In the current treatment algorithm for metastatic
HER2-positive breast cancer, patients who present with de

novo metastatic disease (previously untreated) or those
with prior trastuzumab exposure who have a treatment-free
interval of  6 months are offered the CLEOPATRA regimen (docetaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab) upfront.
For patients with a treatment-free interval of < 6 months,
the preference is to initiate therapy in the metastatic setting
with ado-trastuzumab emtansine. For patients with metastatic breast cancer who progress while receiving HER2directed therapy, we continue targeted agents beyond disease progression with subsequent regimens at the current
time.18
Results from the MARIANNE study (ClinicalTrials.
gov identifier: NCT01120184), a randomized trial comparing trastuzumab emtansine alone, trastuzumab plus a
taxane, and trastuzumab emtansine plus pertuzumab for
the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic breast
cancer) are eagerly anticipated to further expand the
options available to women with metastatic HER2-positive
breast cancer. Until more advances are made in biomarkerdriven research, clinicians are charged with the task of
selecting the most appropriate drug for each patient in the
best order using their best clinical judgment, and prior trastuzumab exposure should be an important consideration in
current and future treatment algorithms.
Resistance to targeted therapy is a significant problem in patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer, and potential mechanisms have been postulated and
continue to be explored.17,32 The phosphatidylinositol 3kinase pathway plays a central role in the mechanism of
resistance to trastuzumab; it can be activated by genetic
alterations or by increased upstream signaling via growth
factor receptors and is associated with poor outcomes.3335
Furthermore, mammalian target of rapamycin is a key

intracellular point of convergence for multiple cellular signaling pathways and has emerged as the most advanced
therapeutic target in treatment-resistant HER2-positive
breast cancer.36,37 The incorporation of tissue-based correlative studies into prospective trial designs will help to
expand the current knowledge base of trastuzumab resistance mechanisms in patients with HER2-positive breast
cancer and potentially inform the development of
improved therapeutic strategies and predictive markers.38
Resistance mechanisms to trastuzumab may in part
explain the worse outcomes of patients who were previously exposed to prior targeted therapy; however, it is important to consider that there may also be underlying
resistance to chemotherapy itself.
We acknowledge the limitations of the current
study. This was a retrospective study performed at a single
institution. Although to the best of our knowledge, the
current study is the largest series of its kind, the patient
population was small considering that trastuzumab has
been a well-accepted adjuvant therapy since 2005. The
majority of patients in the group who did not receive prior
trastuzumab were originally diagnosed with stage I to III
HER2-positive breast cancer in the late 1990s or early
2000s, when adjuvant trastuzumab was not yet established
as the standard of care. In addition, the eligibility criteria
for this retrospective review did not require measurable
disease, and 16% of the patients had to be excluded from
the response analysis because of nonmeasurable disease or
a lack of response data. The data regarding the first site of
distant metastasis were difficult to interpret because
patients who presented with multiple sites of disease were
classified into 1 group based on a prespecified order of importance. Finally, it is important to recognize that patients
previously exposed to trastuzumab were more likely to
have received anthracycline-=taxane-based chemotherapy,
to have had aggressive disease at the time of presentation,
to have had hormone receptor-negative disease, and to
have had a shorter disease-free interval. Because of these
limitations, definitive conclusions should not be drawn
from the results of the current study. The value of the current study lies in recognizing prior trastuzumab exposure
as we sequence available therapies in the clinic and design
intelligent clinical trials. The current study also provides a
point estimate for expected benefit from HER2-targeted
therapies tested in the metastatic disease setting.
The results of the current study demonstrate the
need for further research and emphasize the importance of
recognizing pretreated populations in selecting currently
available therapies and in future trial enrollment. The discovery of more reliable tools will enhance clinical
