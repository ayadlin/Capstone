Abstract
Gene expression profile analysis of lung cancers revealed the
transactivation of an immunoglobulin-like molecule Nectin-4
in the majority of non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLC).
Immunohistochemical staining of 422 NSCLCs showed that a
high level of Nectin-4 expression was associated with poor
prognosis for NSCLC patients (P < 0.0001), and multivariate
analysis confirmed its independent prognostic value (P <
0.0001). We established an ELISA to measure serum Nectin-4
and found that serum Nectin-4 levels were significantly higher
in NSCLC patients than in healthy volunteers. The proportion
of the serum Nectin-4–positive cases was 88 of 164 (53.7%)
NSCLCs, whereas only 3 of 131 (2.3%) healthy volunteers were
falsely diagnosed as positive, which was superior to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cytokeratin 19-fragment
(CYFRA21-1) in sensitivity and specificity. A combined ELISA
for both Nectin-4 and CEA increased sensitivity and classified
65.0% of lung adenocarcinomas as positive with false-positive
rate of 4.6%. The use of both Nectin-4 and CYFRA21-1
classified 68.3% of lung squamous cell carcinomas as positive
with false-positive rate of 6.1%. Treatment of lung cancer cells
with small interfering RNAs against Nectin-4 suppressed its
expression and cell growth. In addition, exogenous expression
of Nectin-4 increased the lamellipodia formation and the
invasive ability of mammalian cells through activation of
small GTPase Rac1. Nectin-4 might play a significant role in
lung carcinogenesis, and it should be a new candidate serum
and tissue biomarker, as well as a therapeutic target. [Cancer

Introduction
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide (1).
About 30% of patients who are diagnosed to have non–small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) are able to undergo curative resection,
whereas the remaining patients with an advanced disease are
mainly treated with chemotherapy alone or in combination with a
local treatment modality (2). In fact, the overall 5-year survival rate
of NSCLC patients still remains at only 15% (3, 4). A number of
targeted therapies were shown to be effective for a subset of

advanced NSCLC patients (5–9). However, issues of toxicity limit
these treatment regimens to selected patients.
To identify new molecules involved in pathways of carcinogenesis,
we had performed genome-wide expression profile analysis of 101
lung cancers with the cDNA microarray containing 27,648 genes and
expressed sequence tags (ESTs) (10–15). To verify the biological and
clinicopathologic significance of the respective gene products, we
have been performing tumor-tissue microarray analysis of clinical
lung cancer materials as well as RNA interference assays (16–37). This
systematic approach revealed that Nectin-4 (alias poliovirus receptor–
related 4, PVRL4) was transactivated in the majority of NSCLCs.
The Nectin family is the Ca2+-independent immunoglobulin-like
molecules consisting of four members (Nectin-1, Nectin-2, Nectin3, and Nectin-4), which are supposed to trans-interact homophilically and heterophilically, and play a role in cell-cell adhesion (38).
Nectins 1, 2, and 3 are widely expressed in adult tissues, but Nectin4 was expressed specifically in the embryo and placenta (39, 40).
Recently, Nectin-4 was indicated to be overexpressed in breast
carcinoma and have a soluble form that is released into the blood
(41, 42). In spite of the recent evidence of Nectin-4 overexpression
in cancer, the biological significance of Nectin-4 activation in
human cancer progression and its clinical potential as a
therapeutic target were not fully described.
Here, we report that Nectin-4 plays a significant role in cancer
cell growth and invasion, and could be a potential target for the
development of therapeutic agents as well as a novel serum and
tissue biomarker for lung cancer.

Materials and Methods
Clinical tissue samples. Primary lung cancer samples as well as their
corresponding normal tissues adjacent to resection margins from patients,
who had no anticancer treatment before tumor resection, had been
obtained earlier with informed consent (11). The histologic classification
of the tumor specimens was based on WHO criteria (43). All tumors
were staged on the basis of the pTNM pathologic classification of the
International Union Against Cancer (Table 1A; ref. 44). A total of 422
formalin-fixed samples of primary NSCLCs including 265 adenocarcinomas
(ADC), 116 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), 28 large cell carcinomas, 13
adenosquamous cell carcinomas and adjacent normal lung tissues, had
been obtained earlier along with clinicopathologic data from patients who
had undergone surgery at Saitama Cancer Center (Saitama, Japan). This
study and the use of all clinical materials were approved by the individual
Institutional Research Ethics Committees.
Serum samples. Serum samples were obtained with informed consent
from 131 healthy volunteers as controls [88 males and 43 females; median
age (F1 SD), 55.5 F 9.6 y; range, 31–83; Supplementary Table S1B] and from
86 nonneoplastic lung disease patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) enrolled as a part of the Japanese Project for Personalized

with precise follow-up record after treatments were also obtained. Group 1:
serum samples obtained with informed consent before curative surgical
resection at Kanagawa Cancer Center Hospital from 95 early stage NSCLC
patients [stage I, 48 males and 47 females; median age (F1 SD), 66.8 F 9.6 y;

consent from 62 advanced stage NSCLC patients (stage IIIB–IV) treated
later with an identical protocol of the first-line chemotherapy using both
carboplatin and paclitaxel admitted to Hiroshima University Hospital [46
males and 16 females; median age (F1 SD), 61.7 F 10.2 y; range, 35–79].

their tumors were pathologically diagnosed as NSCLCs (stages I–IV). Serum
was obtained at the time of diagnosis and stored at 150jC.
Generation of murine anti–Nectin-4 monoclonal antibody. The anti–
Nectin-4 monoclonal antibodies (clones 19–33 and 66–97) were produced
using standard method after successive i.p. injections of 20 Ag soluble
recombinant protein (Nectin-4 ectodomain) to mice.
Flow cytometry and immunocytochemical analyses. Flow cytometric
and immunocytochemical analyses were performed using anti–Nectin-4
antibody (clone 19–33), as previously described (17).
Immunohistochemistry and tissue microarray. Tumor-tissue microarrays were constructed using 422 formalin-fixed primary NSCLCs as
described elsewhere (45–47). To investigate the status of the Nectin-4
protein in clinical lung cancer samples that had been embedded in paraffin
blocks, we stained the sections using 16.25 Ag/mL of mouse anti–Nectin-4
antibody (clone 19–33) as previously described (34). Because the intensity of
staining within each tumor tissue core was mostly homogenous, the
intensity of Nectin-4 staining was semiquantitatively evaluated by three
independent investigators without prior knowledge of clinicopathologic
data using following criteria: strong positive (scored as 2+), dark brown
staining in >50% of tumor cells completely obscuring plasma membrane
and cytoplasm; weak positive (1+), any lesser degree of brown staining
appreciable in tumor cell plasma membrane and cytoplasm; absent (scored
as 0), no appreciable staining in tumor cells. Cases were defined as strongly
positive if all of the three reviewers independently classified them as such.
ELISA. Serum levels of Nectin-4 were measured by sandwich-type ELISA
that was originally developed using mouse anti–human Nectin-4 antibodies
(please see above). In brief, for detection of Nectin-4 in serum, 96-well
flexible microtiter plates (439454; NALGE NUNC International) were coated
with 5 Ag/mL of capturing monoclonal antibody to Nectin-4 (clone 19–33)
overnight. Wells were blocked with 300 AL PBS (pH 7.4) containing 5%
bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 2 h and then incubated for 2 h with 6-fold
diluted serum samples in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 1% BSA. After washing
with PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.05% Tween 20, the wells were incubated for
2 h with 10 ng/mL of biotin-conjugated monoclonal anti–Nectin-4 antibody
(clone 66–97), followed by reaction with avidin-conjugated peroxidase
(P347; Dako Cytomation) using a Substrate Reagent (R&D Systems). The

color reaction was terminated by addition of 50 AL 2N sulfuric acid. Color
intensity was determined by a photometer at a wavelength of 450 nm, with a
reference wave length of 570 nm. Standard curve was drawn for each plate
using recombinant soluble Nectin-4 proteins (Nectin-4 ectodomain). Serum
levels of Nectin-4 were calculated using dilutions of the recombinant
Nectin-4 protein (raging from 0.1–300 ng/mL) as a reference. Levels of
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in serum were measured by ELISA with a
commercially available enzyme test kit (Hope Laboratories) according to the
supplier’s recommendations. Levels of cytokeratin 19-fragment (CYFRA21-1)
in serum were measured by ELISA with a commercially available kit (DRG).
Statistical analysis. We used contingency tables to analyze the
relationship of Nectin-4 levels in tissues or serum and clinicopathologic
variables of NSCLC patients. Survival curves were calculated from the date
of surgery or diagnosis to the time of death, or to the last follow-up
observation. Kaplan-Meier curves were calculated for each relevant variable,
and for Nectin-4 expression in lung tumors or for serum Nectin-4 levels;
differences in survival times among patient subgroups were analyzed using
the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed with
the Cox proportional hazard regression model to determine associations
between clinicopathologic variables and cancer-related mortality.
In ELISA, differences in the serum levels of Nectin-4, CEA, and CYFRA211 between tumor groups and a healthy control were analyzed by MannWhitney U tests.
RNA interference assay. To evaluate the biological functions of Nectin-4
in lung cancer cells, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes against
the target genes (Dharmacon) as described (37). The target sequences of the
synthetic oligonucleotides for RNA interference were as follows: control 1 (a
nonspecific control oligo); control 2 (Luciferase: Photinus pyralis luciferase
gene), 5¶-CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGA-3¶; siRNA-Nectin-4 -#1, 5¶-ACAGUUACCACGUCUGAGGUU-3¶, siRNA-Nectin-4-#2, 5¶-AAUGGUUCAUGGCCUGUUUUU-3¶.
Rac1 activation assay. Activation of Rac1 by Nectin-4 overexpression
was detected according to the supplier’s recommendations using Rac1
activation assay kit (Cell Biolabs), and COS-7 and NIH-3T3 cells transfected
with Nectin-4–expressing pcDNA3.1-myc/His plasmid or mock plasmid and
further cultured for 48 h.

Results
Nectin-4 expression in lung tumors and normal tissues. To
search for novel target molecules for the development of
therapeutic agents and/or diagnostic biomarkers for NSCLC, we
first screened genes that showed more than a 5-fold higher level of
expression in cancer cells than in normal cells, in the majority of
NSCLCs analyzed by cDNA microarray. Among 27,648 genes and
ESTs screened, we identified Nectin-4 to be a good candidate that
showed more than a 5-fold higher level of expression in 87.5% of
NSCLCs. We confirmed its transactivation by semiquantitative
reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) experiments in 11 of 14
additional NSCLC cases (6 of 7 ADCs; 5 of 7 SCCs), and in 7 of
20 lung cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1). We subsequently
attempted to generate mouse monoclonal antibodies specific to
human Nectin-4 and obtained two independent clones, 19-33 and
66-97. As Nectin-4 was indicated to be a type I membrane protein,
we examined Nectin-4 expression on the surface of lung cancer
cells using flow cytometry with anti–Nectin-4 monoclonal antibody

www.aacrjournals.org

(clone 19–33). This analysis indicated that Nectin-4 protein was
highly expressed and localized at the plasma membranes of NCIH2170 and NCI-H358 cells, in which Nectin-4 protein had been
detected at a high level by semiquantitative RT-PCR, but not in
those of A549 and SBC-5 cells that did not express Nectin-4
(Fig. 1A). Immunocytochemical staining of the same set of lung
cancer cells with anti–Nectin-4 monoclonal antibody (clone 19–33)
indicated that Nectin-4 was detected at plasma membrane and
cytoplasm in NCI-H2170 and NCI-H358, but not in A549 and SBC-5
cells (Fig. 1B). Since the ectodomain of Nectin-4 (43.5 kDa) was
suggested to be secreted by cleavage of its extracellular portion
(41), we applied ELISA to examine its presence in the culture media
of the lung cancer cell lines. The amounts of detectable Nectin-4 in
the culture media was concordant to the expression levels of
Nectin-4 detected with RT-PCR, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence analyses (Fig. 1C), further supporting the specific
binding affinity of our monoclonal antibodies to Nectin-4. Attempts
to measure endogenous Nectin-4 protein levels in the NCI-H2170

and NCI-H358 cell lines by Western blotting using the two
monoclonal antibodies (clones 19–33 and 66–97) failed to detect
any bands on Western blots, indicating that these antibodies can be
used for recognition of a native form of Nectin-4. We further
confirmed that the two monoclonal antibodies (19–33 and 66–97)
could specifically immunoprecipitate Nectin-4 protein in myctagged Nectin-4–overexpressing COS-7 cells (Supplementary Fig.
S2, left), but not in mock-transformant COS-7 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S2, right), suggesting that these antibodies have an ability to
specifically recognize the native Nectin-4.
Northern blotting using Nectin-4 cDNA as a probe identified the
3.7-kb transcript as a very faint signal in placenta and to a lesser
degree in trachea among the 23 normal human tissues examined
(data not shown), which was concordant with previous report (39).
We subsequently examined expression of Nectin-4 protein in six
normal tissues (heart, lung, liver, kidney, trachea, and placenta), as
well as lung cancers using anti–Nectin-4 monoclonal antibody, and
found that it was hardly detectable in the former five tissues,
whereas positive Nectin-4 staining appeared in placenta and lung
tumor tissues. The expression levels of Nectin-4 protein in lung
cancer were significantly higher than those in placenta (Fig. 2A).

Association of Nectin-4 expression with poor clinical
outcomes for NSCLC patients. To further verify the biological
and clinicopathologic significance of Nectin-4, we examined the
expression of Nectin-4 protein by means of tissue microarrays
consisting of NSCLC tissues from 422 patients who underwent
surgical resection. We classified a pattern of Nectin-4 expression on
the tissue array ranging from absent/weak (scored as 0–1+) to
strong (2+; Fig. 2B). Of the 422 NSCLC cases examined, Nectin-4
was strongly stained in 245 cases (58.1%; score 2+), weakly stained
in 119 cases (28.2%; score 1+), and not stained in 58 cases (13.7%;
score 0), whereas their adjacent normal lung tissues were not
stained (Fig. 2C). We then evaluated the association between
Nectin-4 status and clinicopathologic parameters. As shown in
Table 1A, histological type (higher in ADC; P = 0.0059 by Fisher’s
exact test) and pT factor (higher in T2–T4; P = 0.0048 by Fisher’s
exact test) were significantly associated with the strong Nectin-4
positivity (score 2+). NSCLC patients whose tumors showed strong
Nectin-4 expression revealed shorter survival periods compared
with those with absent/weak Nectin-4 expression (P < 0.0001 by
log-rank test; Fig. 2D). We also applied univariate analysis to
evaluate associations between patient prognosis and other factors

including age (<65 versus z65), gender (female versus male),
histologic type (ADC versus non-ADC), pT classification (T1 versus
T2-4), pN classification (N0 versus N1+N2), smoking history
(nonsmoker versus smoker), and Nectin-4 expression status (score
0+, 1+ versus 2+). Among those parameters, strong Nectin-4
positivity (P < 0.0001), elderly (P = 0.0079), male (P = 0.0011), nonADC (P = 0.0208), advanced pT stage (P < 0.0001), and advanced
pN stage (P < 0.0001) were significantly associated with poor
prognosis. Multivariate analysis of these prognostic factors
revealed that strong Nectin-4 expression, elderly, larger tumor size,
and lymph node metastasis were independent prognostic factors
for NSCLC patients (P < 0.0001, 0.0006, 0.0006, and <0.0001,
respectively; Table 1B).
Serum levels of Nectin-4 in NSCLC patients. As the in vitro
findings had suggested a possibility of application of Nectin-4 as a
serum biomarker (Fig. 1C), we investigated whether the Nectin-4 is
secreted into sera of patients with NSCLC. ELISA experiments
detected Nectin-4 in serologic samples from the majority of the 164
patients with NSCLC (Fig. 3A); serum levels of Nectin-4 in NSCLC
patients were 2.0 F 2.5 ng/mL (mean F 1 SD). In contrast, the

www.aacrjournals.org

mean (F1 SD) serum levels of Nectin-4 in 131 healthy volunteers
were 0.6 F 0.4 ng/mL, and those in 86 patients with COPD, who
were current and/or former smokers, were 0.6 F 0.9 ng/mL. The
difference in the levels of serum Nectin-4 protein between NSCLC
patients and healthy volunteers was significant with P value of
<0.0001 (Mann-Whitney U test). The difference between healthy
volunteers and COPD patients was not significant (P = 0.103 by
Mann-Whitney U test). When classified according to histologic
types, the serum levels of Nectin-4 were 2.0 F 2.5 ng/mL in ADC
patients and 2.0 F 2.3 ng/mL in SCC patients (Fig. 3A, left). Serum
Nectin-4 was detected even in patients with operative stage tumors
(stages I–IIIA; Fig. 3A, right). Using receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curves drawn with the data of these 164 NSCLC patients and
131 healthy donors (Fig. 3B, left), the cutoff level in this assay was
set to provide optimal diagnostic accuracy and likelihood ratios
(minimal false-negative and false-positive results) for Nectin-4,
i.e., 1.0 ng/mL with a sensitivity of 53.7% [88 of 164 NSCLC; 6 of
24 (25%) stage I, 10 of 20 (50%); stage II–IIIA; and 72 of 120 (60%)
stage IIIB–IV tumors] and a specificity of 97.7% (128 of 131;

Nectin-4 level as a cancer-specific biomarker, we next examined the
relationship between serum Nectin-4 positivity and patients’ or
healthy individuals’ characteristics (Supplementary Table S1B and
C; Table 2). Serum Nectin-4 positivity was significantly associated
with pT factor (higher in T2–T4; P = 0.0039 by Fisher’s exact test) in
NSCLC patients (Table 2). Importantly, serum Nectin-4 positivity
was not associated with smoking history, gender, and age in
individual groups of lung cancer, COPD, and healthy volunteer
(Supplementary Table S1B and C; Table 2). In addition, there was
no significant association between its positivity and respiratory
function in COPD patients (Supplementary Table S1C). To evaluate
the feasibility of using serum Nectin-4 level as a tumor detection
biomarker, we also measured by ELISA serum levels of two
conventional tumor markers (CEA and CYFRA21-1) for NSCLC

patients, in the same set of serum samples from cancer patients
and control individuals. ROC analyses (Fig. 3B, left) determined the
cutoff value of CEA for NSCLC detection to be 2.5 ng/mL with a
sensitivity of 42.7% [70 of 164 NSCLC; 4 of 24 (16.7%) for stage I, 3 of
20 (15%) for stage II–IIIA, and 63 of 120 for (52.5%) stage IIIB–IV
tumors] and a specificity of 97.7%, and also determined the cutoff
value of CYFRA21-1 to be 2.0 pg/mL with a sensitivity of 39.0%
[64 of 164 NSCLC; 1 of 24 (4.2%) for stage I, 3 of 20 (15%) for stage
II–IIIA, and 60 of 120 (50%) for stage IIIB–IV tumors] and a
specificity of 96.2% (please see also Supplementary Table S1A). The
sum of the area under the ROC curve for serum Nectin-4 value was
larger than that for serum CEA or CYFRA21-1, suggesting that
Nectin-4 is likely to be a better diagnostic biomarker for NSCLC in
the aspect of specificity and likelihood.

Nectin-4 as a Therapeutic Target

We then evaluated the feasibility of using serum Nectin-4 level
as a tumor detection biomarker in combination with CEA or
CYFRA21-1. Measuring both Nectin-4 and CEA in serum can
improve overall sensitivity for detection of lung ADC to 65.0% (for
diagnosing ADC, the sensitivity of CEA alone is 42.3% and that of
Nectin-4 is 54.5%). False-positive results for either of the two tumor
markers among 131 healthy volunteers (control group) amounted
to 4.6% (6 of 131), whereas the false-positive rates for CEA and
Nectin-4 in the same control group were 2.3% (3 of 131) each. On
the other hand, Nectin-4 and CYFRA21-1 in serum can improve
overall sensitivity for detection of lung SCC to 68.3% (for
diagnosing SCC, the sensitivity of CYFRA21-1 alone is 53.7% and
that of Nectin-4 is 51.2%). False-positive results for either of the two
tumor markers among 131 healthy volunteers (control group)
amounted to 6.1% (8 of 131), whereas the false-positive rates for
CYFRA21-1 and Nectin-4 in the same control group were 3.8% (5 of
131) and 2.3% (3 of 131), respectively.
We then performed ELISA experiments using paired preoperative and postoperative (2 months after the surgery) serum samples
from NSCLC patients to monitor the levels of serum Nectin-4 in the
same patients. The concentration of serum Nectin-4 was decreased
after surgical resection of primary tumors (Fig. 3B, right). We
further compared the serum levels of Nectin-4 with the expression
levels of Nectin-4 in primary tumors in the same set of 12 NSCLC
cases whose serum had been collected before surgery (six patients
with Nectin-4–positive tumors and six with Nectin-4–negative
tumors). The serum levels of Nectin-4 showed good correlation
with the expression levels of Nectin-4 in primary tumors (Fig. 3C),
further suggesting that serum Nectin-4 was secreted from lung
tumor.
Association of serum Nectin-4 positivity with poor clinical
outcomes for NSCLC patients. We next examined by ELISA the
serum Nectin-4 levels before curative surgery in additional 95
patients with stage I NSCLC and those at diagnosis in 62 patients
with advanced NSCLC (stage IIIB–IV) who were newly diagnosed
and previously untreated, and whose clinicopathologic background
affecting prognosis was mostly identical, and found the correlation
of serum Nectin-4 positivity with clinical outcomes. The median
survival time of serum Nectin-4–positive patients with stage I
NSCLC after curative surgery or advanced NSCLC treated with an
identical protocol of chemotherapy was shorter than those of
patients with serum Nectin-4 negative (P = 0.0219 and 0.0269,
respectively, by log-rank test; Fig. 3D, top and bottom). We also
applied univariate analysis to evaluate associations between
patient prognosis and other factors including age, gender,
histologic type, disease stage, smoking history, and serum Nectin4 positivity. Univariate analysis indicated that only serum Nectin-4
positive was significantly associated with poor prognosis for early
stage NSCLC patients after surgery (P = 0.0301; Supplementary
Table S2A). In advanced NSCLCs, univariate analysis indicated
that serum Nectin-4 positive (P = 0.036) and poorer Performance
Status (P = 0.0004) were significantly associated with poor
prognosis for newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC patients
(Supplementary Table S2B). Multivariate analysis revealed that
both serum Nectin-4 positivity and poorer Performance Status
were independent prognostic factors for the NSCLC patients (P =
0.0394 and 0.0004, respectively; Supplementary Table S2B). These
results independently support the high specificity and the great
potentiality of serum Nectin-4 as a biomarker for detection of
cancer at an early stage and for predicting the early progression
of the disease.

Effect of Nectin-4 on the growth of NSCLC cells. To assess
whether up-regulation of Nectin-4 plays a significant role in the
growth and/or survival of lung cancer cells, we transfected siRNAs
for Nectin-4 to lung cancer cell lines NCI-H2170 and NCI-H358
that overexpressed endogenous Nectin-4. The levels of Nectin-4
expression in the cells transfected with siRNA for Nectin-4
(si-Nectin-4-#1 and -#2) were significantly reduced compared
with those transfected with any of the two control siRNAs
(Fig. 4A). In accordance with the suppressive effect of the siNectin-4-#1, and -#2 on Nectin-4 expression, colony numbers and
cell viability measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays were significantly reduced
(Supplementary Fig. S4A and B), but no such effect was observed
by two control siRNAs.
To further examine the effect of Nectin-4 on the growth of lung
cancer cells, we transfected plasmids designed to express Nectin-4
or mock plasmids into PC-14 cells that did not express endogenous
Nectin-4, and established two independent PC-14 cell lines
overexpressing exogenous Nectin-4 (PC-14-Nectin-4-#A and PC14-Nectin-4-#B) and two control cells (PC-14-Mock-#A and PC-14Mock-#B). MTT assay revealed that growth of the two PC-14Nectin-4 cells was promoted at a significant degree compared with
control PC-14-Mock cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A). To investigate
a potential role of Nectin-4 in vivo tumor growth, we s.c.
transplanted either PC-14-Nectin-4-#B cells or PC-14-Mock-#B
cells into BALB/cAJcl-nu/nu mice. During the 20-day observation,
all three mice that were individually transplanted with PC-14Nectin-4-#B cells showed significantly more rapid tumor growth
compared with three independent mice transplanted with PC-14Mock-#B cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B). These findings imply an
in vivo and in vitro growth promoting effect of Nectin-4.
Enhancement of cellular invasion by overexpression of
Nectin-4. As the immunohistochemical analysis on tissue microarray had indicated that NSCLC patients with Nectin-4–strong
positive tumors showed shorter survival period than those with
Nectin-4–negative or weak positive tumors, we examined a
possible role of Nectin-4 in cellular migration and invasion by
Matrigel assays using mammalian COS-7 and NIH-3T3 cells. As
shown in Supplementary Fig. S4B, cells transfected with myc/Histagged Nectin-4–expressing plasmids showed significant invasive
activity through Matrigel compared with those transfected with
mock vector.
Next, we examined the effect of Nectin-4 on the cell morphology
by transfecting myc/His-tagged Nectin-4–expressing plasmid into
COS-7 and NIH-3T3 cells. Immunocytochemical analysis using antimyc antibody for exogenous Nectin-4 and phalloidin for filamentous actin (F-actin) clearly detected that the membrane protrusions, which were strongly stained with phalloidin, was significantly
increased after transfection of Nectin-4 (Fig. 4C, top and bottom).
No such effect was observed in the cells transfected with mock
vector. Interestingly, exogenous Nectin-4 was strongly stained and
partly colocalized with F-actin at these protrusions. These results
suggest that overexpression of Nectin-4 induced lamellipodia
formation in these cells.
Activation of Rac1 by overexpression of Nectin-4. The
extension of protrusions, such as lamellipodia, is essential for cell
motility, and the formation of lamellipodia requires activation of
small GTPases Rac1 (48). We therefore examined whether Rac1
activity could be involved in Nectin-4–dependent enhancement of
the cell motility. Like other small GTPases, Rac1 regulates
molecular events by cycling between an inactive GDP-bound form

and an active GTP-bound form. In its active (GTP-bound) state,
Rac1 binds specifically to the p21-binding domain of p21-activated
protein kinase to control downstream signaling cascades. Based on
this mechanism, we attempted to investigate a possible activation
of Rac1 by Nectin-4 overexpression, using lysate from COS-7 and
NIH-3T3 cells transfected with Nectin-4–expressing plasmid or
mock plasmid, which were mixed with p21-activated protein
kinase-p21-binding domain agarose beads to affinity-precipitate
the protein complex containing GTP-Rac1 (active form). The levels
of GTP-Rac1 were elevated in COS-7 and NIH-3T3 cells transfected
with Nectin-4–expressing plasmid, compared with those transfected with mock vector (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that
Nectin-4 could enhance the lamellipodia formation and cellular
invasion possibly through activation of Rac1.

Discussion
Nectin family members are both homophilic and heterophilic
cell adhesion molecules that bind afadin, an actin filament
(F-actin)–binding protein through their cytoplasmic tails and
associate with the actin cytoskeleton, and could regulate many
other cellular activities such as movement, differentiation,
polarization, and the entry of viruses, in cooperation with other
cell adhesion molecules and cell surface membrane receptors
(38, 39). In our study, we have shown that activation of Nectin-4 is
likely to be an essential contributor to the cell growth and highly
malignant phenotype of tumors through the Rac1-signaling
pathway. Although detailed functional association between Nectin-4 transactivation and lung carcinogenesis remains to be
clarified, targeting the Nectin-4 pathway provides a large possibility
for developing new types of therapeutic drugs such as nucleic acid
drugs, monoclonal antibodies, and cancer vaccines that are
expected to have a powerful biological activity against cancer with
a minimal risk of adverse events in patients.
Possible mechanisms of antibody-based cancer therapy can be
classified into two categories (49). One is the direct action, which
can be subcategorized into three modes, (a) blocking function,
(b) stimulating function, and (c) targeting function. The other
mechanism of antibody therapy is the indirect action by the
immune system, including complement-dependent cytotoxicity
and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (49). We confirmed that two
mouse monoclonal antibodies raised against the ectodomain of
Nectin-4 (clones 19–33 and 66–97) for ELISA had no antitumor
activity in vitro when treated Nectin-4–overexressing lung cancer
cells only with the antibodies (data not shown). Because Nectin-4
was highly expressed on the surface of lung cancer cells and the
ectodomain of Nectin-4 was secreted (Fig. 1A), we need to clarify
in the future study the mechanism of carcinogenesis involving the

cell surface and/or extracellular Nectin-4. Based on the data, the
production of monoclonal antibodies targeting cell surface Nectin4 that could induce antibody-dependent cytotoxicity/complementdependent cytotoxicity activity and/or block oncogenic receptor
signals, or those neutralizing the secreted Nectin-4 would be
warranted.
We established our original ELISA system by the two mouse
monoclonal antibodies to measure serum levels of Nectin-4 and
showed that serum Nectin-4 levels were significantly higher in
lung cancer patients than in healthy volunteers. This is a great
advantage to develop practical and standardized diagnostic kits in
the clinic. Extracellular part of Nectin-4 is reported to be processed
by TACE/ADAM-17 and a soluble Nectin-4 is shed from the cell
surface and released into the extracellular space (41). Metalloprotease-mediated cleavage of some single-pass type I transmembrane proteins, such as L1CAM released by ADAM10mediated membrane-proximal cleavage, has been shown to
stimulate cellular migration and neurite outgrowth (50). The
ectodomain shedding of Nectin-4 might exert some signals
important for cancer progression. Importantly, serum Nectin-4
levels measured by our ELISA system showed higher sensitivity and
specificity (53.7% and 97.7%, respectively) than conventional serum
tumor markers for NSCLC (CEA or CYFRA21-1) that are being used
in clinical practice (Supplementary Table S1A). Furthermore, serum
Nectin-4 in patients with operable stages of NSCLC also showed
higher sensitivity (25% in stage I; 50% in stage II–IIIA) than serum
CEA (16.7% in stage I; 15% in stage II–IIIA) or CYFRA21-1 (4.2% in
stage I; 15% in stage II–IIIA). Although further validation using a
larger set of serum samples covering various clinical stages will be
required, our data presented here also indicate a potential clinical
usefulness of Nectin-4 as a serologic biomarker for NSCLC that
could be widely used in clinical practice, such as detection of
cancer, prediction of the malignant potential of tumor, and
monitoring the disease control condition after any anticancer
treatment. Finally, it should be noted that we observed activation of
Nectin-4 in more than half of a series of other types of cancers such
as bladder and cervical carcinomas we examined (data not shown),
suggesting its diagnostic and therapeutic application to a widerange of tumors.
