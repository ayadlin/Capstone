ABSTRACT:
Vimentin is an intermediate filament protein, with a key role in the epithelial to
mesenchymal transition as well as cell invasion and it is often upregulated during
cancer progression. However, relatively little is known about its regulation in cancer
cells. Here, we performed an RNA interference screen followed by protein lysate
microarray analysis in bone metastatic MDA-MB-231(SA) breast cancer cells to
identify novel regulators of vimentin expression. Out of the 596 genes investigated,
three novel vimentin regulators EPHB4, WIPF2 and MTHFD2 were identified. The
reduced vimentin expression in response to EPHB4, WIPF2 and MTHFD2 silencing
was observed at mRNA and protein levels. Bioinformatic analysis of gene expression
data across cancers indicated overexpression of EPHB4 and MTHFD2 in breast cancer
and high expression associated with poor clinical characteristics. Analysis of 96 cDNA
samples derived from both normal and malignant human tissues suggested putative
association with metastatic disease. MTHFD2 knockdown resulted in impaired cell
migration and invasion into extracellular matrix as well as decreased the fraction
of cells with a high CD44 expression, a marker of cancer stem cells. Furthermore,
MTHFD2 expression was induced in response to TGF-β stimulation in breast cancer
cells. Our results show that MTHFD2 is overexpressed in breast cancer, associates with
poor clinical characteristics and promotes cellular features connected with metastatic
disease, thus implicating MTHFD2 as a potential drug target to block breast cancer
cell migration and invasion.

INTRODUCTION

cancer cell lines [5-8]. Furthermore, vimentin expression
has been associated with poor outcome in breast cancer
[9]. Vimentin is a well-known marker of epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT), a process which plays
a crucial role in carcinogenesis by enabling cancer cell
dissemination from metastatic tumors, promoting cell
invasion as well as acquisition of therapeutic resistance
[10, 11]. During EMT, cells lose epithelial characteristics,
such as expression of keratins and E‑cadherin and gain
mesenchymal properties, such as expression of vimentin
and N-cadherin.
In addition to providing a structural scaffold to the
cell, intermediate filaments control cell motility. Various

Vimentin is a ubiquitous intermediate filament (IF)
protein normally expressed in cells of mesenchymal origin
[1]. Intermediate filaments along with microtubules and
actin microfilaments are important structural components
of the cell cytoskeleton. Vimentin has been suggested
to be the most widely expressed IF protein in mammals
[2]. In addition to mesenchymal cells, vimentin is also
expressed by migratory epithelial cells involved in
embryonic processes, organogenesis, wound healing and
tumor progression [3, 4]. Upregulation of vimentin has
been reported in various cancers and aggressive breast

reports show that vimentin plays an important role in
cell migration [12-14]. Vimentin has also been indicated
in regulation of cell survival, cell adhesion and lipid
transport [15-17]. Inhibition of vimentin filament integrity
causes mesenchymal cells to adopt an epithelial shape
[17] and downregulation of vimentin expression has been
shown to impair carcinoma cell migration and adhesion
[16]. Furthermore, transfection of vimentin antisense
oligonucleotide into invasive and vimentin-positive MDAMB-231 breast cancer cells led to significant decrease of
in vitro invasive properties, indicating a functional role
for vimentin in regulating cancer cell invasion [18]. Since
vimentin has such an important role in regulating cancer
cell migration and invasion, it has been suggested as a
potential target for cancer therapy [19].
Despite the important role of vimentin in cancer cell
behavior, relatively little is known about its regulation.
Vimentin has been suggested to be regulated by several
factors, including nuclear factor-KappaB (NF-κB),
β‑catenin/TCF, and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β),
which all have been associated with the EMT-process [6,
20-23]. TGF-β is known to enhance cell migration in
mammary epithelial cells [24]. Wu et al. located a TGF-β1
responsive element in the vimentin promoter region and
showed that TGF-β regulates vimentin expression via
Smads, AP-1 and Sp1 in myoblasts and myotubes during
differentiation [21]. Furthermore, Axl receptor tyrosine
kinase has been shown to mediate the vimentin-induced
effects on cell motility and invasion [25].
Here, we identified three novel vimentin regulating
genes in high-throughput RNAi lysate microarray screens
in metastatic basal like breast cancer cells. Further in silico
and in vitro validation in cultured breast cancer cells as
well as in clinical breast cancer samples, indicated one
of these genes, MTHFD2 (methylenetetrahydrofolate
dehydrogenase 2), as a potential drug target to block breast
cancer cell migration and invasion.

effect of target gene silencing on vimentin expression
was assessed using lysate microarray technology [27].
The integrity of the control siRNAs was validated
both at mRNA and protein level (Fig 1A). To exclude
siRNAs reducing vimentin expression due to decreased
cell proliferation, total protein amount of each spot was
measured (Fig 1B). The correlation between two replicate
screens was r=0.92, confirming the functionality of the
assay (Fig 1C). Hit selection for vimentin expression
decreasing siRNAs was done based on the Z-score values
(≤ -2, measuring standard deviations from the mean) and
amount of total protein in the spot (≥ 0.75). The siRNAs
qualified for the hit selection criteria in both or either of
the screens are presented in Table 1. All positive control
siRNAs targeting VIM (n=5) were among these siRNAs.

Hit validation.
Three siRNA target genes WIPF2, MTHFD2 and
EPHB4 were selected for further analyzes. None of these
genes have been previously described as modulators of
vimentin expression in breast cancer.
WIPF2 (WAS/WASL interacting protein family,
member 2) belongs to the family of Wiskott-Aldrich
syndrome proteins (WASP), shown to participate in WASPmediated organization of the actin cytoskeleton [28].
MTHFD2 (methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2)
is a mitochondrial enzyme with methylenetetrahydrofolate
dehydrogenase
and
methenyltetrahydrofolate
cyclohydrolase activities. In normal tissues, MTHFD2 is
expressed only during development and it participates in
formylmethionyl transfer RNA required for the initiation
of protein synthesis in mitochondria [29]. Elevated
expression of MTHFD2 has been previously associated
with increased risk of bladder cancer [30]. EPHB4 (ephrin
type-B receptor 4) belongs to a family of ephrin binding
receptors. Overexpression of EPHB4 in breast cancer has
been previously described and implicated as promoter of
cell migration and invasion as well as a survival factor in
breast cancer [21, 31, 32].
Four siRNAs per gene targeting WIPF2, MTHFD2
or EPHB4 were introduced to MDA-MB-231(SA) cells
and vimentin protein expression was analyzed 120 hours
after transfection (Fig 2A). For each target, two siRNAs
reducing vimentin protein expression by at least 25% were
selected for further validation. Target gene and vimentin
silencing was validated with qRT-PCR (Fig 2B). All
siRNAs except WIPF2 targeting siRNA_6 reduced the
target gene mRNA expression by at least 70% compared to
scrambled control. In addition, all studied siRNAs except
siEPHB4_5 reduced the expression of vimentin mRNA by
at least 29%. EPHB4 and MTHFD2 target gene silencing
was also validated on protein level (Supplementary Figure
S1). These results suggest that WIPF2, MTHFD2, and
EPHB4 regulate vimentin expression on both protein and

vimentin

Despite the strong evidence of the importance of
vimentin in carcinogenesis, its regulation has not been
thoroughly investigated. To reveal novel modulators for
vimentin expression in breast cancer cells, we conducted
two replicate RNAi screens in basal highly metastatic
MDA-MB-231(SA) cells. The siRNA library consisted of
2024 siRNAs targeting 596 genes either highly expressed
in breast or prostate cancer samples, previously associated
with metastasis or over-expressed in bone metastatic vs.
parental MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells [26]. The

expression in the same dataset showed that tumor grade
was an independent predictor of survival (data not shown),
whereas MTHFD2 expression alone was not sufficient to
predict prognosis. Based on these results and the fact that
EPHB4 had already been described as a target for breast
cancer treatment [33], MTHFD2 was chosen for more
detailed functional studies.

regulators in silico.
To analyze the in vivo relevance of the identified
vimentin regulators, published gene expression data from
normal and malignant human tissue samples was utilized.
Results from a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated
that high expression of MTHFD2 or EPHB4 associate
with poor relapse free survival (p=0.002 and p=0.011
respectively) (Fig 2C). On the contrary, high expression
of WIPF2 was associated with better relapse free
survival (p=0.029). A multivariate analysis of MTHFD2

To investigate the function of MTHFD2 in breast

in the same samples as genes involved in regulation of
cell cycle, cellular movement as well as cellular assembly
and organization processes. Genetic disorder, neurological

MTHFD2 knockdown does not significantly alter
cell proliferation.
The co-expression analysis indicated that MTHFD2
associates with processes controlling cell cycle. To
validate whether MTHFD2 knockdown directly affects
cell proliferation or induction of apoptosis, MDAMB-231(SA) cells were transfected as described and
assayed for cell viability and caspase 3/7 activity. The
results indicated that MTHFD2 depletion did not have
a significant effect on cell proliferation or induction of
apoptosis in these breast cancer cells (Fig 4B). A Plk1
targeting siRNA was used as a positive control in the
apoptosis assay.

performed. The results indicated that in normal tissues
MTHFD2 is expressed especially in blood myeloid
cells as well as in hematopoietic and mesenchymal
stem cells whereas in cancer samples, the highest
expression was seen in lymphoma and neuroblastoma
(Supplementary Figure S2). Importantly, MTHFD2
mRNA was overexpressed (p<0.005) in clinical breast
cancer samples compared to normal breast tissues (Fig.
3A). The association of MTHFD2 mRNA expression to
clinical and phenotypical parameters was also analyzed.
High MTHFD2 was associated with hormone receptor
(ER, PgR) negative, HER2 positive breast cancer as
well as with several other characteristics of poor clinical
outcome such as p53 mutation, high grade tumors, lymph
node (LN) positivity, increased risk of cancer death, basal
subtype, increased proliferation measured by Ki67 and
PCNA positivity (Fig. 3B). Results of all comparisons are
described in Supplementary Table S1.

MTHFD2 knockdown inhibits breast cancer cell
migration and invasion.
Vimentin is a regulator of cell migration and
invasion in breast cancer cells [25]. To validate the defect
in cell migration in response to MTHFD2 knockdown, a
wound healing assay was done in MDA-MB-231(SA),
BT-549 and parental MDA-MB-231 cells. These cell lines
were chosen based on mutual expression of MTHFD2
and vimentin mRNAs (Supplementary Figure S3A).
In addition to MDA-MB-231(SA) cells, MTHFD2
knockdown decreased vimentin expression also in in
BT-549 cells (Supplementary Figure S3B). The cells
were transfected with vimentin and MTHFD2 targeting
siRNAs, scratch-wounded and wound closure was
monitored for 12 hours. The results showed impaired
wound healing in all studied cell lines (Fig. 5A and
Supplementary Figure S3C). The most prominent decrease
in relative wound confluence was observed after transient
knockdown of vimentin in MDA-MB-231(SA) cells
(decreased to 58%) and similar effect was also observed
in response to MTHFD2 knockdown (decreased to 76%
with siMTHFD2_3, 73% with siMTHFD2_7). In BT-

MTHFD2 is overexpressed in breast cancer and
associates with cancer metastasis.
To further investigate MTHFD2 mRNA expression
in breast cancer and to study tissue type selectivity, a
Tissue Scan cDNA panel was used. The results suggested
that MTHFD2 mRNA is overexpressed in breast cancer
samples compared to normal breast tissues [Fig. 4A]. In
addition to breast cancer, elevated MTHFD2 levels were
detected also in colon cancer, kidney cancer and liver
cancer samples. Interestingly, MTHFD2 mRNA was

vimentin network.

549 cells MTHFD2 knockdown resulted in stronger
decrease in wound confluence (siMTHFD2_3 71%,
siMTHFD2_7 74%) than vimentin knockdown (86%).
The effect of MTHFD2 depletion on cell proliferation
was confirmed also in BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cells
(Sipplementary Figure S3D). Furthermore, the effect of
MTHFD2 knockdown on cell invasion was studied in the
most migratory cell line in this panel, MDA-MB-231(SA).
Consistent with the results from wound healing assay,
knockdown of vimentin led to the most dramatic decrease
in cell invasion to Matrigel matrix (54%, p<0.05) (Fig
5B) and similar effect was again observed in response to
MTHFD2 knockdown (siMTHFD2_3 36%, siMTHFD2_7
46%, p<0.05 for both). These results indicate that
MTHFD2 is involved in the regulation breast cancer cell
motility and invasion.

A study by Helfand et al. shows that an organized
vimentin network is required for cell motility [34]. The
morphological changes in vimentin network induced by
MTHFD2 silencing were studied in MDA-MB-231(SA)
cells. After 72 hour transient silencing of vimentin or
MTHFD2, vimentin network was clearly weaker and
deformed compared to control cells (Fig 6A). To find out
whether depletion of MTHFD2 affects cell cytoskeleton,
MTHFD2 deficient MDA-MB-231(SA) were stained for
F-actin expression (Fig 6B). The results indicated that
while MTHFD2 depletion caused a defect in vimentin
organization, it did not alter the overall cell cytoskeleton

transcription factors ZEB1, ZEB2 and SLUG, all known to
regulate E-cadherin and participate in EMT, was reduced
in response to either MTHFD2 or VIM depletion, although
the changes were not significant (Supplementary Figure
S4). Taken together, these results indicated that in addition
to vimentin, MTHFD2 depletion reduced N-cadherin
expression but did not significantly modulate ZEB1, ZEB2
and SLUG transcription in MDA-MB-231(SA) breast
cancer cells.
TGF-β induces MTHFD2 expression in breast
cancer cells. Since TGF-β has been implicated in
regulation of vimentin and promoting cell migration [21,
24], we studied whether stimulation of metastatic breast
cancer cells with TGF-β affects MTHFD2 expression.
Therefore, parental MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB231(SA) cells were stimulated with TGF-β, and MTHFD2
mRNA expression was analyzed with qRT-PCR. The

results showed elevated MTHFD2 mRNA in response to
TGF-β stimulation in both cell lines compared to untreated
control cells (Fig 7B).
MTHFD2 knockdown reduces stem cell marker
CD44. In addition to vimentin and TGF-β, the
transmembrane glycoprotein CD44 has been implicated in
cancer cell migration and invasion [35-37]. CD44 is also
a biomarker of breast cancer tumor propagating cancer
stem cells (CSCs); chemotherapy resistant cells with
metastatic activity capable of forming other cancer cell
populations [38-41]. The effect of MTHFD2 and vimentin
knockdown on the expression of CSC marker CD44 in
MDA-MB-231(SA) cells was studied with fluorescenceactivated cell-sorting analysis. The fractions of CD44low
and CD44high cells in response to MTHFD2 and vimentin
knockdown are shown in Fig. 7B. Both MTHFD2 and
vimentin silencing reduced the amount of CD44high MDA-

more epithelial phenotype. MTHFD2 acts in one-carbon
metabolism in the folate pathway. Interestingly, this
pathway can be therapeutically targeted with methotrexate
[42]. Previous studies indicate that salinomycin promotes
differentation in breast and prostate cancer cells and
monensin in prostate cancer cells [43-45]. To find
out whether  methotrexate, monensin or salinomycin
modulate MTHFD2 or vimentin expression in breast
cancer cells, MDA-MB-231(SA) cells were exposed

to 5µM concentrations of these agents for 72 hours.
Western blot analysis confirmed that these agents reduced
vimentin as well as MTHFD2 expression, although
salinomycin resulted in cell death at this concentration
(Fig 8A). This indicated that in addition to decreasing
vimentin expression these pharmacological agents also
downregulated MTHFD2 expression, which further
validated our results on the connection between vimentin
and MTHFD2 in breast cancer cells.
Cancer cells have been suggested to gain resistance
to conventional cancer therapeutics through induction of
EMT. To study whether MTHFD2 knockdown sensitizes

breast cancer cells to antineoplastic agents, MDA-MB231(SA) cells were transfected as previously described,
treated with 0.5 or 1 µM methotrexate, cisplatin or
paclitaxel for 24 hours followed by measurement of cell
viability. The raw values were compared to the non-treated
scrambled siRNA transfected control. The results indicated
that MTHFD2 silencing potentiated the anti-proliferative
effect of 0.5 µM methotrexate (Fig 8). Interestingly,
MTHFD2 inhibition had a significant additive effect
(siM_3: 38%; p<0.005 and siM_7: 45%; p<0.005) only
with methotrexate and not with paclitaxel or cisplatin,
suggesting a putative combinatorial anti-proliferative

µM methotrexate concentration, MTHFD2 silencing did
not induce an additive anti-proliferative effect, indicating
that high methotrexate concentration alone is sufficient to
block the anti-neoplastic benefit resulting from MTHFD2
depletion (Supplementary Figure S5).

and ephrin type-B receptor 4 (EPHB4) were identified.
Reduced vimentin protein and mRNA expression levels
in WIPF2, MTHFD2 or EPHB4 impaired cells were
confirmed also in validation experiments. Importantly,
knockdown of VIM, MTHFD2, EPHB4 or WIPF2 did not
have a strong effect on total protein expression, indicating
that reduced vimentin expression was not a secondary
effect caused simply by decreased cell viability.
WIPF2 has been previously described to participate
in WASP-mediated organization of the actin cytoskeleton,
whereas EPHB4 has been shown to promote breast cancer
cell migration, invasion and survival [28, 31]. Since the
biological consequences of MTHFD2 impairment in
cancer cells had not been previously studied in detail,
MTHFD2 was chosen for functional characterization.
Moreover, our in silico gene expression analysis indicated
an association with high MTHFD2 mRNA expression and
characteristics of poor outcome in clinical breast cancer
samples, indicating that MTHFD2 may promote disease
progression.
Comparison of mRNA levels between normal
human tissues indicated that MTHFD2 is highly expressed
in blood myeloid cells as well as in hematopoietic

DISCUSSION
Vimentin is a key regulator of breast cancer cell
migration and a marker for mesenchymal subtype,
characteristic of cancer cells that have undergone
epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). Despite the
clinical relevance, very little is known about vimentin
regulation in cancer. In this study, a high-throughput
RNAi screening approach was undertaken to identify
novel vimentin regulators among ~600 cancer relevant
genes in cultured breast cancer cells. The screens were
done in metastatic breast cancer cells expressing vimentin
at high levels and three novel vimentin regulators - WAS/
WASL interacting protein family member 2 (WIPF2),
methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2)

and mesenchymal stem cells whereas among human
malignancies, lymphoma and neuroblastoma showed the
highest expression. Importantly, MTHFD2 mRNA levels
were elevated also in clinical breast cancer samples in
comparison to normal breast tissues. MTHFD2 mRNA
was overexpressed especially in HER2 positive, estrogen
and progesterone receptor negative breast cancer samples
and was also associated with other disease characteristics
(such as presence of p53 mutation and lymph node
positivity) of poor outcome.
Validation of MTHFD2 mRNA expression in eight
different types of human normal and malignant tissues
confirmed overexpression specifically in breast cancer
samples. High levels were detected particularly in breast
cancer samples derived from advanced and metastatic
disease. Interestingly, MTHFD2 had been previously
associated as one of potential cancer biomarkers in
quantitative proteomic study of cultured breast cells
from normal breast tissue, primary breast cancer and
metastatic breast cancer derived from the same patient
[46]. In agreement with our preliminary results from
human tissues, MTHFD2 is known to be expressed in
tumor cells, but not in normal cells in adult mice [47].
Moreover, although MTHFD2 expression was low in
other solid tumors analyzed in this study, high levels of

MTHFD2 were detected in metastatic samples derived
from colon cancer and renal cell carcinoma patients,
indicating that MTHFD2 may promote tumor progression
also in other solid tumors. Supporting these observations,
elevated expression of MTHFD2 has been previously
associated with increased risk of bladder cancer [30].
However, in order to get conclusive results on the putative
association  between high MTHFD2 expression and
metastatic disease, additional studies with larger patient
cohorts are required.
As a distinct biochemical feature, MTHFD2
uses NAD rather than NADP, and increases
formyltetrahydrofolate content in mitochondria.
Formyltetrahydrofolate is required for thymidylate
synthesis and methylation reactions [48]. Interestingly,
NAD dependent methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase
activity was described in Ehrlich ascites cancer cells
already more than fifty years ago, and twenty five
years later as a general feature of transformed and nondifferentiated cells [49]. Our results showing elevated
MTHFD2 expression especially in cancer samples
derived from patients with a metastatic disease support
in general these conclusions associating NAD dependent
methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase activity with
transformed and non-differentiated cells. However, there

seems to be clear differences in MTHFD2 expression
between samples from the same as well as different cancer
types since MTHFD2 expression could not be detected in
all tumor samples analyzed, indicating heterogeneity in
MTHFD2 expression.
Due to the identification of MTHFD2 as a modulator
of vimentin expression in metastatic breast cancer cells
and high expression associating with poor characteristics
in clinical breast cancer samples, the cellular consequences
of MTHFD2 impairment to metastasis relevant
phenotypes were studied in more detail. Results from
previous studies indicated that MTHFD2 promotes rapid
cell growth in mice during embryonic development [47].
However, our results indicated that in highly metastatic
breast cancer cells, MTHFD2 impairment did not have
a significant effect on cell viability. Instead, MTHFD2
was identified as a critical regulator of breast cancer cell
migration and invasion. In addition to downregulating
vimentin, MTHFD2 depletion also reduced N-cadherin
expression. Moreover, MTHFD2 expression was induced
in response to TGF-β stimulation in breast cancer cells.
This indicates that in addition to vimentin, TGF-β also
regulates MTHFD2 expression. Furthermore, silencing
of MTHFD2 reduced the population of CD44 cancer
stem marker positive cells indicating that impairment of
MTHFD2 expression reduces cancer stem cell properties
in breast cancer cells. These results suggest that in
addition to decreasing vimentin expression MTHFD2
depletion also reduces other characteristics typical for
metastatic breast cancer cells. Interestingly,  MTHFD2
expression was downregulated by several anti-neoplastic
agents and treatment of MTHFD2 deficient breast cancer
cells with methotrexate showed a putative additive
anti-proliferative response, indicating that MTHFD2
can be therapeutically targeted and also promotes antiproliferative effects.
In this study we show that in addition to decreasing
vimentin mRNA and protein expression, MTHFD2
depletion also decreases CD44 protein expression on
MDA-MB-231(SA) cells. CD44 plays a central role in the
remodelling and degradation of hyaluronic acid, which
leads to cell migration, invasion and cancer metastasis.
A study by Cho et al. shows that CD44 upregulates
mesenchymal markers such as vimentin and N-cadherin
[50]. This supports our results showing that silencing
vimentin in mesenchymal type MDA-MB-231(SA)
cells decreases CD44 expression on the cell surface. In
addition, vimentin targeting siRNA was more efficient in
downregulating CD44 than MTHFD2 targeting siRNA and
the CD44 decrease was proportional to vimentin silencing.
This suggests that MTHFD2 might downregulate CD44
via vimentin. The detailed mechanism by which MTHFD2
regulates vimentin expression remains currently unknown
and requires further investigation. In concordance with
our results, a recent study by Selcuklu et al. suggests
MTHFD2 as a target for miR-9, and reports that MTHFD2
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

knockdown reduces cell migration mimicking miR-9
overexpression [51].
This study identifies WIPF2, EPHB4 and MTHFD2
as novel regulators of vimentin expression by using a
high-throughput RNAi screening approach targeting
cancer relevant genes. Analysis of MTHFD2 expression
showed overexpression in breast cancer samples compared
to normal breast tissues. High MTHFD2 expression
associated with poor clinical characteristics in breast
cancer and functional characterization indicated that
this enzyme is a putative regulator of breast cancer cell
migration and invasion. Moreover, MTHFD2 knockdown
reduced cancer stem cell properties of bone metastatic
breast cancer cells. Our results suggest that mitochondrial
enzyme MTHFD2 has a potential role in breast cancer
progression.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and antibodies
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line was from
American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Bone
metastatic MDA-MB-231(SA) cells were spontaneously
derived from MDA-MB-231 cells during long in vitro
culture [26]. BT-549 cells were obtained from Cell Lines
Service (Eppelheim, Germany). MDA-MB-231(SA) cells
were provided by Theresa Guise (Indiana University,
Indianapolis, IN) and Sanna-Maria Käkönen (University
of Turku, Turku, Finland). All cell lines were maintained
according to distributors instructions and passaged
no longer than 6 months after receive or resuscitation
of frozen aliquots. Antibodies used were as follows,
MTHFD2 (1:500, sc-100750, Santa Cruz Biotechnology
Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), vimentin (1:1000, V6630,
Sigma‑Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), β‑actin (1:5000, SigmaAldrich), Alexa Fluor 680-tagged secondary antibody
(Invitrogen Inc., Carlsbad, CA) and FITC-conjugated
mouse monoclonal anti-human CD44 (BD Pharmingen,
San Diego, CA).
Gene silencing
For gene knockdown, siRNAs (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA) were transfected to the cells using siLentFect Lipid
Reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA) in Opti-MEM
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in final concentration of 13
nM. AllStars Negative Control scrambled siRNA (siScr,
Qiagen) was used as a negative control and a vimentin
targeting siRNA as a positive control for vimentin
knockdown (siVIM, Qiagen). Detailed siRNA information
is presented in Supplementary Table S4
LMA screening, data analysis and hit selection
The custom made siRNA library consisted of 2024
siRNAs targeting 596 genes either highly expressed in
breast or prostate cancer samples, previously associated
with metastasis or over-expressed in bone metastatic vs.

parental MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells [26].
A detailed description of LMA screening has been
published previously [27]. Briefly, MDA-MB-231(SA)
cells were transfected on 384-well plates as above.
After 120 h of incubation in standard conditions, cells
were lysed and lysates printed on nitrocellulose coated
microarray FAST slides (Whatman Inc., Florham Park,
NJ). The vimentin protein expression was detected
with vimentin antibody, followed by exposure to Alexa
Fluor 680-tagged secondary antibody. For total protein
measurement, arrays were stained with Sypro Ruby
Blot solution (Invitrogen). The slides were scanned with
a Tecan LS400 (Tecan Inc., Durham, NC) microarray
scanner and an Odyssey Licor IR-scanner (LI-COR
Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) to detect Sypro and vimentin
signals, respectively. Array-Pro Analyzer microarray
analysis software (Median Cybernetics Inc., Bethesda,
MD) was used for analysing data. Enrichment factor and
P-value according to hypergeometric distribution were
calculated using the minimum Z-score value of negative
control siRNAs as a threshold. Hit limit was set to Z-score
≤ -2. To discard the effect of cell proliferation, total protein
score limit was set to ≥ 0.75. The siRNAs meeting these
criteria in either of the replicate screens were considered
as putative vimentin expression regulating hits.

(n=13) and breast cancer samples (n=957) available in the
GeneSapiens database were utilized also in the in silico
phenotype association (Miller dataset) and co-expression
analyzes. The functional gene ontology annotations were
analyzed for the co-expressed genes (R>0.5 and p<0.001)
using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) Software
(Ingenuity Systems Inc., Redwood City, CA, USA). The
survival analyzes were done using three breast cancer
patient datasets extracted from Gene Expression Omnibus
(GSE6532, GSE9195 and GSE12276). In these patient
series, the relapse-free survival was determined from the
date of diagnosis to the date of first local or distant disease
recurrence, or to the date of last follow-up. The data was
stratified into two groups, samples with high MTHFD2
expression (50%) and samples with low MTHFD2
(50%). For each gene, Kaplan-Meier plots were done by
comparing the two sample groups using log-rank statistics.
Observed differences with log-rank p-value <0.05 were
considered to be statistically significant. All statistical
analyzes were done using R.
Validation of MTHFD2 mRNA expression in clinical
samples
Tissue Scan human cancer cDNA panel (Origene,
Rockville, MD) containing 96 samples from normal (n
= 24, 3 per tissue) and malignant (n = 72, 9 per tissue)
human tissues from eight tissue types (breast, colon,
kidney, liver, lung, ovary, prostate and thyroid gland) was
utilized to validate the expression in clinical samples.
Analysis was done with qRT-PCR as above. Detailed
description of sample origin is presented in Supplementary
Table S6.

Western blotting
Western blot analysis was done using specific
antibodies mentioned above. Signal was detected with
1:4000 dilution of appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary
antibodies (all from Invitrogen Molecular Probes,
Carlsbad, CA) followed by visualization with the enhanced
chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences,
Little Chalfont, UK) and densitometric quantification with
GeneTools software (SynGene, Synoptics Ltd, UK).

Cell viability and apoptosis assays
The effects of MTHFD2 or VIM silencing on
cancer cell viability were assessed with CellTitre-Glo cell
viability assay (Promega Inc., Madison, WI) as described
[53]. Induction of caspase-3 and 7 activities was detected
with homogenous Apo-ONE assay (Promega) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Fluorometric signal was
quantified with Envision Multilabel Plate Reader (PerkinElmer, Massachusetts, MA).

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using
RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol and processed to cDNA with cDNA synthesis
kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). TaqMan
probes and primers were acquired from the Universal
Probe Library (Roche Diagnostics, Espoo, Finland)
(Supplementary Table S5). Real-time quantitative PCR
(qRT-PCR) was done with ABI Prism 7900 (Applied
Biosystems). Quantitation was carried out with RQ
manager 1.2 software using the ΔΔCT method (Applied
Biosystems). Three or more replicate samples were studied
for detection of target mRNA expression and β-actin
used as an endogenous control. Statistical significance
was determined with t-test and p-values < 0.05 were
considered statistically significant.

Wound healing assay
MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-231(SA) and BT-549
cells were transfected as above and incubated on 96well plates for 72 hours in standard conditions. A wound
was scratched across each well (Wound Maker, Essen
BioScience, MI) and wound closure was monitored hourly
with Incucyte imaging software (Essen BioScience) for
12 hours. Wound closure was determined as percentage of
wound confluence compared to respective negative control
(regarded as 100%).

Growth Factor Reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences,
Franklin Lakes, NJ) in DMEM and incubated in +37˚C
for 2-3 hours to allow gelling. The slides were placed on a
4-well cell culture plate and covered with 5 ml of growth
media containing 2% of FBS. The cells were allowed to
invade the matrix for 4 days successively increasing the
serum content of the medium to 4%, 6% and 8% FBS
by changing the medium every day. Cells were stained
for imaging using Calcein AM live-stain (Invitrogen)
1:500 in DMEM, 1 hour in +37˚C. Imaging (~75 1.87µm
stacks) was done from at least 5 different positions per
each well using a Zeiss microscope (Carl Zeiss AG,
Oberkochen, Germany) with a spinning disk confocal
unit, 20 x objective, and SlideBook 5.0 imaging software.
Z-axis projections were analyzed with the NIH ImageJ for
quantitation of the invasion area.

Statistical analyzes were done using Student’s
t-test (*, P<0.05; **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.005) and Pearson
correlation coefficient. Multivariate analysis was carried
out with Cox´s regression. Results from cultured cells are
