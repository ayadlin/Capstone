ABSTRACT
The single-agent activity of rapalogs (rapamycin and its analogues) in most tumor
types has been modest at best. The underlying mechanisms are largely unclear. In this
report, we have uncovered a critical role of GSK3 in regulating degradation of some
oncogenic proteins induced by rapalogs and cell sensitivity to rapalogs. The basal level
of GSK3 activity was positively correlated with cell sensitivity of lung cancer cell lines
to rapalogs. GSK3 inhibition antagonized rapamycin’s growth inhibitory effects both
in vitro and in vivo, while enforced activation of GSK3β sensitized cells to rapamycin.
GSK3 inhibition rescued rapamcyin-induced reduction of several oncogenic proteins
such as cyclin D1, Mcl-1 and c-Myc, without interfering with the ability of rapamycin
to suppress mTORC1 signaling and cap binding. Interestingly, rapamycin induces
proteasomal degradation of these oncogenic proteins, as evidenced by their decreased
stabilities induced by rapamcyin and rescue of their reduction by proteasomal
inhibition. Moreover, acute or short-time rapamycin treatment dissociated not only
raptor, but also rictor from mTOR in several tested cell lines, suggesting inhibition
of both mTORC1 and mTORC2. Thus, induction of GSK3-dependent degradation of
these oncogenic proteins is likely secondary to mTORC2 inhibition; this effect should
be critical for rapamycin to exert its anticancer activity.

The conventional mTOR inhibitors, rapamycin and its
analogues (rapalogs), are specific allosteric inhibitors
of mTOR. It is generally thought that these rapalogs
have weak activity against the mTORC2 while strongly
inhibiting mTORC1 activity. In the clinic, the singleagent activity of rapalogs in most tumor types has been
modest at best although some of them (e.g., everolimus)
have been approved by the FDA for treatment of several
types of cancers such as advanced renal cell cancer and
pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors [8]. Currently, it is
unclear why most types of cancers respond poorly to
rapalog monotherapy.
Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) is a ubiquitous
serine/threonine kinase with two isoforms: α and β, in
mammals, encoded by different genes [9, 10]. GSK3
regulates many cellular functions such as glycogen
metabolism, insulin signaling, cell proliferation, apoptosis
and neuronal function [9, 10]. Thus, GSK3 inhibition has

INTRODUCTION
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a
serine-threonine protein kinase belonging to the family
of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases [1].
It critically regulates various biological functions,
particularly cell growth, metabolism and survival, largely
through forming two distinct complexes with different
partner proteins: raptor (mTOR complex 1; mTORC1)
and rictor (mTOR complex 2; mTORC2) [2–4]. The
mTORC1 signaling primarily regulates cap-dependent
protein translation initiation, an essential process for
synthesis of many oncogenic proteins such as cyclin D1,
c-Myc, Mcl-1, HIF1α and VEGF [3, 4]. This signaling
pathway is often dysregulated (activated) in various types
of human cancers, largely due to hyper-activation of PI3K/
Akt and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling, and hence has
emerged as an attractive cancer therapeutic target [5–7].

been considered an attractive therapeutic strategy for
certain human diseases such as diabetes, neurodegenerative
diseases, muscle hypertrophy, and mental disorders [11,
12]. Accordingly, several potent GSK3 inhibitors have
been developed, most of which are ATP competitive
and inhibit both GSK3α and GSK3β  [12]. GSK3 has
also been implicated in regulation of oncogenesis, but
with complex patterns: it acts paradoxically as a tumor
suppressor in some cancers while potentiating growth in
others [13–15]. Because of the concern that inhibition of
GSK3 may promote oncogenesis, the progress of GSK3
inhibitors into clinical trials has been clouded [15].
Our recent study has demonstrated that maintaining
GSK3 activity is critical for mTOR kinase inhibitors to
exert their anticancer activity [16]. The current study
has focused on determining whether GSK3 activity also
impacts the anticancer efficacies of rapalogs and on
understanding the underlying mechanisms. Out results
have shown that GSK3 is also an important determinant

inhibitory effects evaluated in a 3-day monolayer culture assay (A and B), in an 8-day colony formation assay (C), by
cell cycle analysis (D) and in a nude mice xenograph model (E). (A and B), The given lung cancer cell lines were plated on 96-

well cell culture plates and treated next day with the indicated concentrations of rapamycin (Rap) alone, SB216763 (SB) or CHIR99021
(CHIR) alone (as indicated by arrow inside the graphs) or their combination. After 3 days, cell numbers were estimated using the SRB
assay and CIs were calculated with CompuSyn software and labeled inside the graphs. Data, means of four replicated determinations; Bars,
± SDs. (C), The indicated cell lines at a density of approximately 400 cells/well were seeded in 12-well plates. On the second day, the cells
were treated with DMSO, 10 nM rapamycin, 5 μM SB216763, or rapamycin plus SB216763 (SB). After 8 days, the plates were stained
for the formation of cell colonies with crystal violet dye and pictured using a digital camera. (D), The indicated lung cancer cell lines were
treated with DMSO, 10 nM rapamycin, 5 μM SB216763, or rapamycin plus SB216763 for 48 h and then harvested for cell cycle analysis by
flow cytometry. (E), H460 xenografts were treated with indicated agents. This study was done in conjunction with our previous INK128 and
SB216763 combination experiment and thus the vehicle and SB216763 groups were shared to minimally use mice (see details in “Materials
and Methods”). Tumor sizes were measured once every two days. Each measurement is a mean ± SE (n = 6). At the end of the experiment,
tumor xenografts were removed and weighed. **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001 compared with RAD001 group alone using the student t test.

in every tested cell line were far greater than 1, indicating
super-antagonistic effects. Similar antagonistic effects
were also observed in other NSCLC cell lines (e.g.,
EKVX, H226 and H292; Supplementary Fig. S1). In
a long-term colony formation assay that allows us to
repeat the treatments, the combination of SB216763 and
rapamycin was also less effective than rapamycin alone
in inhibiting colony growth of both A549 and H460
cell lines (Fig. 1C), further confirming the antagonistic
effects. Furthermore, rapamycin induced G1 arrest in both
A549 and H460 cells; however this effect was abrogated
by the addition of SB216763 (Fig. 1D). Collectively,
these results robustly indicate that inhibition of GSK3
impairs the ability of rapamycin to suppress the growth
of NSCLC cells.
We further conducted lung cancer xenograft
experiment in nude mice to demonstrate whether GSK3
activity is important for the anticancer activity of rapalogs
in vivo. RAD001 alone very effectively inhibited the
growth of H460 xenografts; however, the combination
of RAD001 with SB216763 was significantly weaker
than RAD001 alone in inhibiting the growth of the
xenografts (Fig. 1E) although it did not apparently affect
the body weights of mice (data not shown). This result was
generated in conjunction with our previous INK128 and
SB216763 combination experiment as described in our
previous study [16] and thus the vehicle and SB216763
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

groups were shared in order to minimally use mice. Hence,
it is clear that inhibition of GSK3 attenuates the ability of
RAD001 to inhibit the growth of lung cancer xenografts
in nude mice, indicating that GSK3 activity is also critical
for rapalogs’ antitumor activity in vivo.

Genetic manipulation of GSK3 expression alters
cell response to rapalogs
To further validate our finding, we examined
the impact of specific genetic inhibition of GSK3,
including gene knockdown and knockout, on cell
responses to a rapalog. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)mediated knockdown of GSK3α, GSK3β or both
were confirmed with Western blotting (Fig. 2A). In a
3-day growth-inhibition assay, knockdown of GSK3α,
GSK3β or both significantly reduced cell sensitivity
to rapamycin (Fig.  2B). Consistently, GSK3α-KO or
GSK3β-KO murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)
were drastically less sensitive to both rapamycin and
RAD001 in comparison with wild-type (WT) MEFs
(Figs. 2C and 2D). Taken together, these data further
support the notion that inhibition of GSK3 impairs cell
response to rapalogs.
Furthermore, we asked whether GSK3 activation
can increase cell sensitivity to rapamycin. To this end,
we transfected a constitutively active form of GSK3β

Following these findings, we further determined
whether basal levels of GSK3 activity are associated with
cell sensitivity to rapalogs. Here we detected basal levels
of p-GSK3 as an indication of inactivated or low GSK3
activity in a panel of 13 NSCLC cell lines by Western
blotting (Fig. 3A). These cell lines possessed different
sensitivities to rapamycin or RAD001 as determined in
a 3-day growth-inhibitory assay (Fig. 3B). Correlation
analysis showed that high p-GSK3 levels (i.e., low GSK3
activity) were significantly associated with weak growthinhibitory effect of rapamycin (r = 0.7895, P = 0.0013)

mTORC1 signaling. Furthermore we compared the effects
of rapamycin with and without SB216763 on cap-binding
of the eIF4F complex. In this experiment, rapamycin
effectively reduced the amounts of eIF4G bound to
eIF4E with increased amounts of 4EBP1 bound to eIF4E
regardless of the presence or absence of SB216763
(Fig.  4B), suggesting that inhibition of GSK3 does not
impair the ability of rapamycin to suppress cap-dependent
translation initiation either. Under the same conditions,
rapamycin decreased the levels of cyclin D1, an oncogenic
protein known to be regulated by mTORC1-mediated capdependent translation. Interestingly, co-treatment of the
cells with SB216763 and rapamycin prevented cyclin D1
reduction induced by rapamcyin in both tested cell lines
(Fig. 4A).
In addition to translation regulation, cyclin D1
is known to be regulated at the posttranslational level
through GSK3-dependent protein degradation [17, 18].
Hence, we examined other two proteins, c-Myc and Mcl-1,
known to be regulated by both cap-dependent translation
and GSK3-dependent protein degradation mechanisms
[5, 19, 20]. Like cyclin D1, rapamycin reduced the levels
of both c-Myc and Mcl-1 in 3 tested NSCLC cell lines
even early at 4 h post treatment (Fig. 4C). The presence
of SB216763 rescued the reduction of both c-Myc and
Mcl-1 induced by rapamycin (Fig. 4D). Moreover, we
tested the effects of another GSK3 inhibitor, CHIR99021,
and GSK3 knockdown on rapamycin-induced reduction
of cyclin D1, c-Myc and Mcl-1. In agreement with the
findings using SB216763, both CHIR99021 (Fig. 4E)
and GSK3 knockdown (Fig. 4F) rescued reduction of
these proteins induced by rapamycin. Thus, it is clear that
rapamycin induces a GSK3-dependent reduction of cyclin
D1, c-Myc and Mcl-1, likely independent of translation
regulation.

c-Myc and Mcl-1 (Fig. 4D). Moreover, we determined
whether rapamycin affects the stabilities of these proteins.
Compared with DMSO control, rapamycin apparently
shortened the half-lives of not only cyclin D1, but also
c-Myc and Mcl-1 (Fig. 5B), indicating that rapamycin
decreases the stabilities of these proteins. Collectively,
these data clearly suggest that rapamycin decreases the
levels of cyclin D1, c-Myc and Mcl-1 through promoting
their degradation.
It is known that the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBX4 is
involved in mediating GSK3-dependent degradation of
cyclin D1 [18] and FBXW7 mediates GSK3-dependent
degradation of both c-Myc and Mcl-1 [19, 20]. Hence, we
further determined the impact of knockdown of these E3
ligases on rapamycin-induced reduction of these proteins.
As shown in Fig. 5C, knockdown of FBX4 elevated basal
levels of cyclin D1 and rescued cyclin D1 reduction
induced by rapamycin. When FBXW7 was silenced in
both A549 and H460 cells, rapamycin failed to decrease
the levels of both c-Myc and Mcl-1 (Fig, 5D). We used
reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) to confirm the
knockdown efficacies of FBXW7 as presented (Fig. 5D,
lower panel). In addition, we also compared the effects
of rapamycin on reduction of c-Myc and Mcl-1 between
WT and FBXW7-KO HCT116 cell lines and found that
rapamycin reduced the levels of c-Myc and Mcl-1 in
HCT116 WT cells, but failed to do so in HCT116/FBXW7KO cells (Fig. 5E). Collectively, these results demonstrate
that rapamycin induces FBX4-dependent degradation of
cyclin D1 and FBXW7-mediated degradation of c-Myc
and Mcl-1, furthering the notion that rapamycin induces
GSK3-dependent degradation of cyclin D1, c-Myc and
Mcl-1.

We have recently suggested that mTORC2 is
responsible for stabilizing cyclin D1 [16]. mTORC2 was
initially suggested as a rapamycin-insensitive complex
[22, 23] and can be suppressed by prolonged exposure
to rapamycin [24]. Despite this, we wanted to determine
experimentally whether acute rapamycin treatment
affects mTORC2 formation in our tested cancer cell
lines. In addition to NSCLC cell lines (H157, A549 and
H358), we also included other types of cancer cell lines
including prostate cancer (DU145 and PC-3), head and
neck cancer (686LN) and breast cancer (MDA-MB-435)
cells. These cell lines responded to rapamycin albeit with
varied degrees (Fig. 6A). Upon rapamycin treatment for
4 h, we detected cyclin D1 reduction in all 7 tested cell
lines, Mcl-1 reduction in 6 of 7 cell lines (except for

We were interested in knowing how inhibition of
GSK3 blocks rapamycin-induced reduction of cyclin D1,
c-Myc and Mcl-1 without interfering with the suppression
of mTORC1 signaling and cap-binding by rapamycin.
Considering that GSK3 is involved in regulating
degradation of these proteins [19–21], we asked whether
rapamycin-induced reduction of these proteins is due
to enhanced protein degradation. To this end, we first
compared the effects of rapamycin on cyclin D1 reduction
in the absence and presence of the proteasome inhibitor,
MG132. We observed that rapamycin-induced cyclin D1
reduction was prevented by the presence of MG132 in all
three tested cell lines (Fig. 5A). Similarly, the presence
of MG132 rescued rapamycin-induced reduction of both

phosphorylated by mTORC2 at either hydrophobic motif
(e.g., Akt S473, PKCα S657 and SGK1 S422) or turn
motif (Akt T450 and PKCα T638) [26]. In agreement
with our previous observation [27], acute rapamycin
treatment increased Akt S473 phosphorylation in every
tested cell line; however, we did not see apparent
alteration of Akt T450 phosphorylation in any of the cell
lines. Interesting, phosphorylation (S21/9) of GSK3, a
putative Akt substrate, was only slightly increased by
rapamycin in H157 and 686LN cells, but not in other cell
lines (Fig. 6D). In contrast to Akt S473 phosphorylation,
rapamycin did not increase the phosphorlation of
PKCα and SGK1 in any of the tested cell lines. Rather
it decreased PKCα T638 phoshorylation in 4 (H157,
A549, PC-3 and MB-435) of 7 tested cell lines, PKCα
S657 phoshorylation in 3 (H157, PC-3 and MB-435)
of 7 tested cell lines and SGK1 S422 phosphorylation
in all the tested cell lines (Fig. 6D). Clearly, acute
treatment of cancer cells with rapamycin inhibits
mTORC2 assembly accompanied with suppression of
SGK1 S422 phosphorylation and increase of Akt S473
phosphorylation.

tumors [16]. Moreover, rapalogs are known to induce
Akt activation while inhibiting mTOR signaling [27,
30]; this will further result in inactivation of GSK3 and
confer resistance to rapalogs. Thus, our finding of the
critical role of GSK3 in determining cancer response
to rapalogs suggests a reasonable scientific base for the
poor efficacy of rapalog monotherapy observed in most
types of cancers. Accordingly, we suggest that additional
enhancement is needed to boost the cancer therapeutic
efficacy of rapalogs (e.g., by combination with an agent
that may potentially prevent GSK3 inactivation). In
this regard, our previous studies have shown that the
combination of a rapalog and a PI3K inhibitor (which
may activate GSK3 through suppression of Akt) exhibited
synergistic anticancer activity [30, 31]. Given that low
baseline GSK3 activity is significantly correlated with
weak growth-inhibitory effects of rapalogs in cancer cell
lines (Fig. 3), further study on GSK3 activity as a possible
predictive biomarker for rapalog-based cancer therapy is
also warranted.
Several oncogenic proteins, such as cyclin D1,
c-Myc and Mcl-1, are known to be regulated by mTORC1
signaling through cap-dependent translation [5, 32].
Although rapamycin reduced the levels of these proteins,
this study surprisingly failed to demonstrate that this
occurs through mTORC1-mediated suppression of capdependent translation, since inhibition of GSK3 prevented
reduction of these proteins without rescuing inhibition
of phosphorylation of p70S6K, S6 and 4EBP1 and
suppression of cap-binding by rapamycin (Fig. 4). Rather,
we have demonstrated that rapamycin induces GSK3dependent degradation of these proteins (Figs. 4 and 5),
revealing a novel mechanism by which rapalogs reduce
the levels of these oncogenic proteins. Our findings are in
fact in agreement with a previous report that rapamycin
induces GSK3-dependent degradation of cyclin D1 in
human breast cancer cell lines [28]. In addition to these
findings, we have further shown that the E3 ubiquitin
ligases, FBX4 and FBXW7, mediate rapamycin-induced
cyclin D1 degradation and c-Myc and Mcl-1 degradation,
respectively (Fig. 5).
Our previous [16] and current studies have
shown that both mTOR kinase inhibitors and rapalogs
induce GSK3-dependent and FBX4-mediated cyclin D1
degradation. Interestingly, we have further suggested that
mTORC2 is actually responsible for stabilizing cyclin
D1; hence inhibition of mTORC2 (e.g., with an mTOR
kinase inhibitor) triggers its degradation, as we previously
suggested [16]. It is unclear whether rapamycin facilitates
cyclin D1 degradation through the same mechanism.
The challenge is that rapamycin is generally thought to
be weak or inactive against the mTORC2. In different
systems in vitro and in vivo, rapamycin has been shown
to inhibit mTORC2; however this effect is largely due
to chronic or prolonged rapamycin treatment that can

DISCUSSION
A previous study primarily using GSK3β
knockout MEFs has suggested that GSK3β enhances
rapamycin-mediated growth inhibition and paclitaxel
sensitization [28]. The current study demonstrated that
both pharmacological and genetic inhibition of GSK3
compromised or antagonized the growth-inhibitory
effects of rapalogs in human NSCLC cells, whereas
enforced activation of GSK3 enhanced cell response
to rapalogs (Figs. 1–2). Moreover, pharmacological
inhibition of GSK3 significantly attenuated the antitumor
efficacy of rapalogs in vivo against the growth of lung
cancer xenografts in nude mice (Fig. 1). Hence this study
provides strong preclinical evidence that the presence of
GSK3 activity is critical for rapalogs to exert their growthinhibitory effects and cancer therapeutic efficacies. This
notion is further supported by our finding that low basal
levels of GSK3 activity in a panel of NSCLC cell lines
are significantly correlated with reduced cell responses to
rapalogs (Fig. 3).
GSK3 activity is known to be negatively regulated
through phosphorylation at Ser 21 (α) and 9 (β) mediated
by PI3K/Akt, PKC, p70S6K and RAS/ERK/RSK2
signaling, which are often hyper-activated in a variety
of cancer types, [29]. Hence it is reasonable to assume
that GSK3 activity should be low in the majority of
cancer types; accordingly these cancers will respond
poorly to rapalogs. Indeed, our recent pilot study has
shown that p-GSK3 is positive in up to 80% of NSCLC
specimens, suggesting suppressed GSK3 activity in these

activity than Akt S473 phosphorylation needs further
investigation.
In summary, this study has demonstrated the novel
activity of rapamycin in inducing GSK3-dependent
degradation of several oncogenic proteins including
cyclin D1, c-Myc and Mcl-1. This effect is likely the
consequence of mTORC2 inhibition and may at least
in part accounts for the growth-inhibitory effects and
anticancer activity of rapalogs (Fig. 7). Thus our findings
highlight a novel mechanism by which rapalogs exert their
biological function and anticancer activity.

eventually disrupt mTORC2 assembly [24, 33–39]. In our
study, we observed rapid reduction of cyclin D1, c-Myc
and Mcl-1 even at 4 h post rapamycin treatment (Figs. 4C
and 6B). Thus, we were interested in knowing whether
short-term or acute treatment with a rapalog suppresses
mTORC2 under our experimental conditions. Intriguingly,
we found that acute treatment with rapamycin (for 1 h)
disrupted the assembly of not only mTORC1 (mTOR
with raptor), but also mTORC2 (mTOR with rictor) in
our tested cell lines (Fig. 6C). When we reviewed the
literature carefully, a previous study in fact did show
that rictor was dissociated from mTOR at 0.5–2 h post
rapamycin in a few cell lines such as PC-3, BJAB and
Jurkat [24]. Nonetheless, there are few studies that
specifically determine the impact of acute rapamycin
treatment on mTORC2 assembly in various types of
cancer cell lines. We believe that rapamycin has an acute
inhibitory effect against assembly of the mTORC2, at
least in some cancer cell lines. Accordingly we suggest
that rapalogs, like mTOR kinase inhibitors [16], induce
GSK3-dependent degradation of cyclin D1 through
inhibition of mTORC2. Elucidation of the mechanism
by which mTORC2 inhibition triggers GSK3-dependent
degradation of these oncogenic proteins has been ongoing.
The outcome of this part of the study may reveal a novel
biological function of mTORC2 in regulation of cell
growth and survival.
Another interesting observation in this study is that
acute rapamycin treatment exerted different effects on
the phosphorylation of Akt, PKCα and SGK1, which are
known to be mTORC2 substrates [26]. Under our tested
conditions, rapamycin clearly reduced p-SGK1 (S422)
levels while increasing Akt S473 phosphorylation in every
tested cell lines (Fig. 6D). It appears that disruption of the
mTORC2 assembly is associated well with suppression
of SGK1 S422 phosphorylation. Whether SGK1 S422
phosphorylation serves as a better readout of mTORC2

were authenticated by Genetica DNA Laboratories, Inc.
(Cincinnati, OH) through analyzing short tandem repeat
DNA profile, other cell lines have not been authenticated.
These cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 or DMEM
medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum at 37°C in a
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air

m7GTP pull-down for analysis of eIF4F complex
eIF4F complex in cell extracts was detected using
affinity chromatography m7GTP-sepharose as described
previously [48].

Detection of mTORCs
mTORCs were detected by immunoprecipitating
mTOR with mTOR (FRAP; N-19) antibody followed with
Western blotting to detect raptor and rictor according to
the same procedure described previously [22, 25].

Lung cancer xenografts and treatments
Lung cancer xenograft experiments were approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC) of Emory University and conducted as
previously described [16]. Five- to 6-week old (about 20 g
of body weight) female athymic (nu/nu) mice were ordered
from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). Mice (6/group) received
the following treatments: vehicle control, RAD001 (1 mg/
kg/day, o.g.), SB216763 in DMSO (5 mg/kg/day; i.p.), and
the combination of RAD001 and SB216763. This study
was done in conjunction with our previous INK128 and
SB216763 combination experiment as described in our
previous study [16] and thus the vehicle and SB216763
groups were shared to minimally use mice.

Cell growth assay
Cells were seeded in 96-well cell culture plates and
treated the next day with the given agents. The cell number
was determined using sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay as
described previously [41]. CI for drug interaction (e.g.,
synergy) was calculated using the CompuSyn software
(ComboSyn, Inc.; Paramus, NJ).

Cell cycle analysis
Cells were harvested after a given treatment and
stained with propidium iodide for cell cycle analysis as
described previously [42, 43].

Statistical analysis
The statistical significance of differences between
two groups was analyzed with two-sided unpaired
Student’s t tests when the variances were equal or with
Welch’s corrected t test when the variances were not equal
by use of Graphpad InStat 3 software (GraphPad Software,
San Diego, CA). Data were examined as suggested by the
same software to verify that the assumptions for use of
the t tests held. Results were considered to be statistically
significant at P < 0.05.

Colony formation assay
The effects of the given drugs on colony formation
on plates were measured as previously described [44].

Western blot analysis
Preparation of whole-cell protein lysates and
performance of the Western blot analysis were the same
as described previously [45, 46].
