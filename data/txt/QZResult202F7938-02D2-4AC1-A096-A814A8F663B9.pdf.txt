ABSTRACT
Colon cancer is the third most common cancer in humans which has a high
mortality rate, and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is one of the most widely used drugs in
colon cancer therapy. However, acquired chemoresistance is becoming the major
challenges for patients, and the molecular mechanism underlying the development
of 5-FU resistance is still poorly understood. In this study, a newly designed therapy
in combination with 5-FU and NVP-BEZ235 in colon cancer cells (HCT-116 and RKO)
was established, to investigate the mechanism of 5-FU resistance and optimize drug
therapy to improve outcome for patients. Our results show 5-FU induced cell apoptosis
through p53/PUMA pathway, with aberrant Akt activation, which may well explain the
mechanism of 5-FU resistance. NVP-BEZ235 effectively up-regulated PUMA expression,
mainly through inactivation of PI3K/Akt and activation of FOXO3a, leading to cell
apoptosis even in the p53–/– HCT-116 cells. Combination treatment of 5-FU and NVPBEZ235 further increased cell apoptosis in a PUMA/Bax dependent manner. Moreover,
significantly enhanced anti-tumor effects were observed in combination treatment in
vivo. Together, these results demonstrated that the combination treatment of 5-FU
and NVP-BEZ235 caused PUMA-dependent tumor suppression both in vitro and in vivo,
which may promise a more effective strategy for colon cancer therapy.

apoptosis in normal and tumor intestinal cells [2]. However,
its response rate is less than 60%, even in combination
with other chemotherapeutic agents [3]. Therefore, a big
issue in the clinical application of 5-FU is drug resistance
[4, 5]. Some researchers believe that 5-FU resistance has
relationship with the mutation of drug target genes and the
change of the expression levels of p53, bax, Bcl-2, and BclxL [6]. But unfortunately, the precise molecular mechanism
for 5-FU resistance in colon cancer remains elusive.

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common
cancer in humans and has a high mortality rate. In the year
2012, 103 170 new cases of colon cancer were diagnosed
and 51 690 deaths occurred from colorectal cancer in the
United States [1]. The five-year survival rate for metastatic
colon cancer is less than 10%. Many therapeutic approaches
have been used for the treatment of colon cancer, including
chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immune
therapy. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is the most commonly used
drug in colon cancer therapy with the capability to induce

downstream target [7–9]. It is localized in the mitochondria
and induces apoptosis by activating Bax directly or
indirectly which leads to mitochondrial outer membrane
permeabilization (MOMP) [10, 11]. MOMP can trigger
a cascade of downstream events to initiate apoptosis,
including the release of proapoptotic factors such as SMAC,
AIF, cytochrome c and the activation of caspase cascade
[12]. The activation of PUMA by DNA damage is dependent
on p53 and is mediated by the direct binding of p53 to the
PUMA promoter region [8, 9, 13]. PUMA can also be
induced via p53-independent manner in response to serum
withdrawal as well as treatments with dexamethasone,
tunicamycin and thapsigargin (TG) [14]. FOXO3a and p73
have been established as direct transcriptional regulators of
PUMA [15, 16]. Therefore, PUMA plays an essential role
in p53-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways
[17] and cells lacking PUMA are resistant to several death
stimuli [18, 19]. Many studies have shown that PUMA
is critical in colon cancer. Activation of PUMA by drug
treatment killed the colon cancer cells which will live
longer when PUMA was deficient [20–23]. Recently, people
reported that PUMA plays an important role in promoting
the apoptosis of prostate cancer and lymphoid malignancies
[24, 25]. Meantime, PUMA was also involved in the
regulation of autophagy, neuro disease and iPSC (induced
pluripotent stem cells) generation [26–28].
AKT, also referred as protein kinase B (PKB), is
a serine/threonine kinase which has three isoforms to
share a high degree of sequence homology. All the three
members (AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3) belong to the AGC
family of protein kinases [29]. Akt resides in the cytosol
and is activated through recruitment to cell membranes
by phosphoinsitide 3-kinase (PI3K) lipid products and
phosphorylation of its Thr308 and Ser473 residues [30].
Once activated, Akt is able to promote cell survival and
proliferation through phosphorylation and inactivation
of key components in the apoptotic cascade [31, 32].
Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is also a serine/
threonine protein kinase belonging to the PI3K-related
kinase family, which regulates cell growth, proliferation,
motility, protein synthesis, and transcription [33]. It is
established that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway makes a big
contribution in many cancers, including colon cancer [34,
35]. Furthermore, activation of this pathway has been shown
to decrease sensitivity to chemotherapeutics as well as to
irradiation (IR) [36, 37], which leads to diminished treatment
success. Therefore, disrupting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway
may be a potential way for cancer therapy, or at least helpful
for increasing sensitivity to chemo and radio therapy. In fact,
there is a novel orally available dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor
NVP-BEZ235, which is currently in phase1/2 clinical trials
for advanced solid tumors as a chemotherapeutic drug [38].
Our previous study shows that PUMA promotes
Bax translocation both by directly interacting with Bax
and by competitive binding to Bcl-XL during cancer cell
apoptosis [11, 39]. While PUMA has also been shown to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mediate 5-FU induced colon cancer cell apoptosis [13,
19] and function as a critical regulator of apoptosis in
colorectal cancer cells [20–23]. However, little is known
about the molecular mechanism for 5-FU resistance in
colon cancer, and new methods should be identified for
the therapy. A recent study showed that NVP-BEZ235 is
effective on both PIK3CA-mutated and unmutated colon
cancer cell lines [40]. Therefore, NVP-BEZ235 may soon
be incorporated into the present treatment regime for
colon cancer. In the present study, we investigated the
effect and related mechanism of 5-FU, NVP-BEZ235 and
their combination treatment in colon cancer cells (HCT116 and RKO). We found that the combination treatment
significantly increased cancer cell apoptosis via a PUMAdependent manner both in vitro and in vivo.

RESULTS
Combination treatment of 5-FU and NVPBEZ235 dramatically suppressed cell
proliferation and induced apoptosis
To establish a proper dose of 5-FU and NVP-BEZ25
in our system, HCT-116 cells were treated with various
doses of 5-FU or NVP-BEZ235 respectively. Cell viability
was analyzed using Cell Counting Kit-8 after 0, 3, 6, 12
and 24 hours treatment. Cells show a decrease in viability
with increasing dose, and a correlation was observed with
posttreatment period (Figure 1A and 1B), which indicates
that the decrease of cell viability treated with 5-FU or NVPBEZ235 is dose and time dependent. However, some different
effects were seen between these two drugs. NVP-BEZ235
shows clear dose and time dependency, but for 5-FU, cell
viability just has small fluctuation among different doses
stimulation. To evaluate the efficacy of combination treatment,
HCT-116 or RKO cells were exposed to either 200 uM 5-FU
or 400 nM NVP-BEZ235 or in combination for 0, 3, 6, 12 and
24 hours. As shown in Figure 1C and 1D, cell viability has
significant decrease after the combination treatment compared
to single drug treatment, at all the time points.
Next, the status of cell apoptosis was evaluated by using
FACS analysis. HCT-116 cells were treated with 200 uM 5-FU,
400 nM NVP-BEZ235 or their combination respectively. As
shown in Figure 1E and 1F, the percentage of cell apoptosis
increased evidently after 5-FU or NVP-BEZ235 stimulation,
and this pro-apoptotic effect was potentiated when both drugs
were used in combination compared to single therapy.

It is believed that p53/PUMA signaling pathway is
very important in cell apoptosis and colon cancer therapy
[13, 19–23]. To confirm this in our experiment model,
the expression of p53 and PUMA were detected in cells
exposed to 0, 50, 100, 200 and 400 uM 5-FU. After 24

hours treatment, p53 and PUMA expression was markedly
up-regulated (Figure 2A). As a critical apoptotic marker,
cleaved PARP also increased markedly (Figure 2A). Next,
HCT-116 cells treated with 200 uM 5-FU was incubated
for 0, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours respectively. As shown in
Figure 2B, the expression of both p53, PUMA and cleaved
PRAP increased gradually over time.
To further confirm our results, parallel experiments
have been carried out in the p53–/– or PUMA–/– HCT-116
cells. The results show increased PUMA expression as well
as cleaved PARP after 5-FU stimulation in wild-type HCT116 cells (Figure 2C), which were completely inhibited in
the p53–/– HCT-116 cells, (Figure 2C and S1A), implying
p53 is required for 5-FU induced PUMA up-regulation
and apoptosis. While in the PUMA–/– HCT-116 cells, p53
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

expression was still up-regulated by 5-FU, but the cleaved
PARP did not (Figure 2C and S1B), suggesting PUMA also
contributed to 5-FU-induced apoptosis.
To observe cell apoptosis directly, morphological
examination was performed with Hoechst 33342 staining.
Chromatin condensation was observed in wild-type HCT116 cells 12 hours after 5-FU treatment, which was almost
completely restored in p53–/– and PUMA–/– HCT-116 cells
(Figure 2D). Taken together, these results revealed that
both p53 and PUMA are indispensable in 5-FU induced
colon cancer cell apoptosis.
Akt activation is a sensitive marker for cancer
cell growth, including colon cancer [34, 35]. So the
phosphorylation of Akt was investigated in our experiment
model. In theory, Akt is supposed to be inactivated after

5-FU treatment because of cell apoptosis. However,
an opposite result was observed. Akt phosphorylation
increased obviously after various doses of 5-FU
treatment (Figure 2E), implying the existence of Akt
survival pathway. Similar result was obtained after
different time points of treatment (Figure 2F), even in
the p53–/– and PUMA–/– HCT-116 cells (Figure 2G). The
activation of Akt/mTOR pathway decreased sensitivity to
chemotherapeutics as well as to irradiation (IR) [36, 37].
Therefore, this aberrant Akt activation indicates potential
mechanism of 5-FU resistance in our system.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Since 5-FU induced Akt activation may be the
potential mechanism for 5-FU resistance, inhibiting
Akt and its downstream pathways might increase the
sensitivity of 5-FU treatment and further induce cancer
cell apoptosis. To verify our hypothesis, HCT-116 cells
were treated with various doses of NVP-BEZ235, or
different time. As a result, Akt phosphorylation level
declined distinctly (Figure 3A and 3B), which indicates the

inhibition of Akt activation. Meantime, p53 expression had
no change compared with that of the control group (Figure
3A and 3B). An interesting thing is PUMA expression
was up-regulated by the NVP-BEZ235, company with
increased cleaved PARP (Figure 3A and 3B). These
results suggested that NVP-BEZ235 up-regulated PUMA
expression and induced apoptosis by inhibiting Akt/mTOR
pathway, which is in a p53-independent manner.
To further confirm our result, parallel experiments
has been performed in the p53–/– or PUMA–/– HCT-116
cells. As a result, PUMA expression and cleaved PARP
increased evidently along with Akt phosphorylation
dropping in the p53–/– HCT-116 cells (Figure 3C and S2A).
However, in PUMA–/– HCT-116 cells, cleaved PARP did
not increase in spite of Akt was inactivated (Figure 3C
and S2B). Furthermore, chromatin condensation was
observed in both wild-type and p53–/– HCT-116 cells after
NVP-BEZ235 treatment, which did not occur in PUMA–/–
HCT-116 cells (Figure 3D). Taken together, these results
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

indicated that PUMA is indispensable during NVPBEZ235 induced colon cancer cell apoptosis, while p53 is
not essential in this process.

PI3K/Akt/FOXO3a pathway plays a major role
in NVP-BEZ235-induced PUMA up-regulation
As p53 is not essential in NVP-BEZ235 induced
apoptosis, and NVP-BEZ235 is a dual PI3K/mTOR
inhibitor, PI3K, Akt, or mTOR may play a critical role in
this process. To further study the molecular mechanism and
clarify which one is dominant, another PI3K/mTOR dual
inhibitor NVP-BBD130, PI3K inhibitor Wortmannin, and
mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin (Sirolimus) were used to treat
both HCT-116 and RKO cells. As shown in Figure 4A and
4B, NVP-BBD130 had an identical effect on decreasing Akt
phosphorylation, up-regulating the expression of PUMA,
cleaved PARP and Caspase3 as that of NVP-BEZ235.

Wortmannin also effectively inhibited Akt phosphorylation,
increased PUMA expression and apoptosis, although not so
markedly as that of NVP-BEZ235. However, Rapamycin
just had a minor effect on PUMA up-regulation and
apoptosis (Figure 4A and 4B). These results suggested that
PI3K/Akt plays a dominant role, whereas mTOR has a
minor role in this process. Of course, the PI3K/mTOR dual
inhibitior NVP-BEZ235 and NVP-BBD130 are superior to
PI3K or mTOR single inhibitor to induce apoptosis.
As a direct transcriptional regulator of PUMA and
downstream target of Akt [15], the status of FOXO3a was
also detected in p53–/– HCT-116 cells in the presence of Akt
inhibitor VIII. The result shows that Akt blockade resulted
in decreased phosphorylation of FOXO3a, indicating the
activation of FOXO3a. In addition, and Akt inhibitor VIII
had almost the same function as that of NVP-BEZ235 on

PUMA up-regulation (Figure 4C). Next, FOXO3a was
deleted by shFOXO3a in p53–/– HCT-116 cells to evaluate
its function. As shown in Figure 4D, FOXO3a deletion
evidently suppressed PUMA up-regulation induced by
NVP-BEZ235. Taken together, these results indicated that
PI3K/Akt/FOXO3a plays a dominant role during NVPBEZ235 induced PUMA up-regulation and apoptosis,
while mTOR plays a minor role in this process.

treatment enhanced p53 expression but decreased Akt
phosphorylation significantly. The exciting finding is
that combination treatment had the synergistic effect on
PUMA expression, cleaved PARP and Caspase3 compared
with that of single drug treatment (Figure 5A and 5B).
Furthermore, the analogous results were obtained in HCT116 cells after long time combination treatment (Figure

treatment on cell apoptosis (Figure 5D and 5E).

so strongly as that in wild-type cells (Figure 5F and S3B).
However, in PUMA–/– cells, cleaved PARP did not increase
at all (Figure 5F and S3C), which was further confirmed
by the crystal violet and Hoechst 33342 staining results
(Figure 5G and 5H), indicating that PUMA is indispensible
in combined treatment induced cell apoptosis.

The result shows that the combination treatment effectively
activated Bax in wild-type HCT-116 cells, which did not
occur in PUMA–/– HCT-116 cells (Figure 6B). Furthermore,
over-expressed PUMA in PUMA–/– HCT-116 cells almost
completely restored Bax activation and apoptosis induced
by the combination treatment (Figure 6C). These results
indicated that PUMA is an upstream regulator which is
required for Bax activation.
To address the essential role of Bax activation in
PUMA-mediated apoptosis, wild-type or Bax–/– HCT116 cells were treated with 5-FU and NVP-BEZ235 for

[11, 39]. Here, the relation between PUMA and Bax
was investigated in HCT-116 cells with the combination
treatment of 5-FU and NVP-BEZ235. As a result, there
is a direct interaction between PUMA and Bax, which
increased significantly after treatment (Figure 6A). Next, a
conformation-specific anti-Bax monoclonal antibody (6A7)
was used to detect the activated/pro-apoptotic form of Bax.

DISCUSSION

The combination treatment caused much more
tumor suppression in vivo

5-FU only had a single effective rate of 24%,
and approximately 31% as the first-line drug of clinic
chemotherapy on colon cancer, while the increase dosage
could cause serious side-effects and drug resistance,
which limited its dosage and therapeutic effect [41, 42].
Nevertheless, it is still the most common and widely used
chemotherapeutic drug for the treatment of colon cancer.
Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanism of
the development of resistance to 5-Fu could definitely
improve its therapeutic effect. A recent report shows that
the mutation of drug target genes and the modification in
the expression levels of p53, bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL may
be involved in the 5-FU resistance [6]. Here, our results
suggest that aberrant Akt activation is a critical reason for
5-FU resistance in killing colon cancer cells. As shown in
Figure 2E–2G, Akt activation enhanced evidently in wt,
p53–/– and PUMA–/– HCT-116 cells after 5-FU stimulation,
which well explained why there is almost no change on

As combination treatment is superior to either
5-FU or NVP-BEZ235 single treatment on PUMA upregulation and cell apoptosis in vitro, we expect it will
further suppress tumor growth in vivo. To confirm it,
HCT-116 cells were injected subcutaneously into nude
mice to establish xenograft tumors. Then the mice were
treated with 25 mg/kg 5-FU by I.P. injection, or 40 mg/kg
NVP-BEZ235 by oral gavage, or their combination for 15
consecutive days. As shown in Figure 7A, the combination
treatment caused more significant tumor suppression
compared to monotherapy. Quantitative analysis displays
that the weight and volume of tumor in combination
treatment group were less than 50% of that in 5-FU or
NVP-BEZ235 single treatment group (Figure 7B and
7C). Immunohistochemistry staining of P-Akt, ki67 and
cleaved Caspase-3 further confirmed that tumor growth

cell viability after increasing doses of 5-FU treatment
(Figure 1A). Because as we all know, the PI3K/AKT/
mTOR signaling pathways not only play an important role
in normal cellular processes such as proliferation, survival,
and differentiation [43], but also frequently deregulated
in cancer cells and its constitutive activity strongly
contributes to the oncogenic process [44, 45].
Since the activation of Akt/mTOR pathway decreased
sensitivity to chemotherapeutics as well as to irradiation
(IR) [36, 37], which was activated in our system, it may
decrease the sensitivity of cells to 5-FU treatment. So we
need to inactivate Akt and its downstream pathway, which
can either increase the sensitivity of 5-FU therapy, or kill
the cells directly, or both. Here, a novel orally available
dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235, which is
currently used in clinical trials with low side-effects,
attracting our attention [38]. In the subsequent studies,
NVP-BEZ235 or was proved to effectively inhibited Akt
avtivation and induced colon cancer cell apoptosis (Figures
1, 3, and 4). NVP-BEZ235 induced cell apoptosis through
different pathway from 5-FU, because it did not affect p53
expression in wt HCT-116 cells, and killed p53–/– HCT-116
cells as wt cells (Figure 3), whereas p53 is required for
5-FU induced cell apoptosis (Figure 2). The most exciting
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

finding is PUMA expression was up-regulated by NVPBEZ235 treatment via a p53-independent way (Figure 3C),
and it is required for both 5-FU and NVP-BEZ235 induced
cell apoptosis (Figures 2C, 2D, 3C and 3D). These results
indicated that PUMA built up a crosstalk between 5-FUinduced and NVP-BEZ235-induced apoptotic pathways.
As a PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor, NVP-BEZ235 upregulates PUMA expression and induces apoptosis through
a complex pathway. To clarify it, different inhibitors
including NVP-BBD130, Wortmannin, Rapamycin and Akt
inhibitor VIII were used to compare with NVP-BEZ235 to
illustrate the effect of PI3K, Akt or mTOR during NVPBEZ235-induced apoptosis. We found that all the inhibitors,
except Rapamycin, have identical effect on Akt inactivation,
and increasing PUMA expression and apoptosis (Figure
4A–4C), whereas Rapamycin had no effect on Akt activity
and only slightly increased PUMA expression and cell
apoptosis, suggesting a minor role in this process (Figure
4A and 4B). FOXO3a was activated as a downstream target
when Akt was inactivated (Figure  4C), which plays an
essential role in PUMA regulation (Figure 4D). All these
indicated PI3K/Akt/FOXO3a is the dominant pathway, and
PI3K/Akt/mTOR is the subordinate pathway, to mediate
NVP-BEZ235-induced PUMA up-regulation and apoptosis.

Antibodies and reagents

Of course, we can not exclude other regulators, waiting
there to be discovered in the process.
As we expected, combination treatment further
increased PUMA expression and cell apoptosis (Figure
5A–5E), and PUMA is indispensible in this process
(Figure 5F–5H). Akt inhibitor VIII was also used to
treat the colon cancer cells in combination with 5-FU,
and obviously increased the sensitivity of 5-FU therapy
(Figure S3A), which further demonstrated the importance
of Akt activation in resistance. In addition, PUMA
is the direct upstream regulator for Bax activation
(Figure 6A–6C), which plays an important role in cell
apoptosis (Figure 6D–6F), indicating the combined
treatment activated the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.
For the in vivo experiments, the combination treatment
caused much more tumor suppression and apoptosis than
that of single treatment of either 5-FU or NVP-BEZ235
(Figure 7), which further confirmed our conclusion.
For the first time, our results demonstrated that
5-FU-induced Akt activation is the potential mechanism
for its resistance. NVP-BEZ235 up-regulated PUMA
expression and induced colon cancer cell apoptosis via
a p53-independent, but an Akt/FOXO3a dependent way
(Figure 8). Therefore, NVP-BEZ235 potentises the antitumor effect not only by inhibiting Akt survival pathway
but also promoting cell apoptosis through PUMA/Bax
pathway. These raise the possibility of combination
treatment to develop a promising therapeutic strategy to
enhance the effects of chemotherapy and improve clinical
outcomes for colon cancer patients with a p53 mutation.
Further studies are necessary to pinpoint whether Noxa or
Bim, the classic downstreams of p53 and Akt, is required
in this process. Meantime, more precise dose selection
should be conducted in animal and clinical studies.

Primary antibodies against p53, Phospho-Akt(S473),
total-AKT, PUMA, cleaved PARP, Ki67, and cleaved
Caspase3 were purchased from cell signaling; alphatubulin antibody was from Santa Cruz Technologies.
Lipofectamine™ Reagent was purchased from Invitrogen.
HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary
antibodies and an ECL-plus kit were from GE Healthcare.
5-FU was purchased from APP Pharmaceuticals and NVPBEZ235 was purchased from LC Laboratories. The plasmid
of expressing PUMA was kindly supplied by Jian Yu, Ph.D.
[9]. The oligonucleotide for shFOXO3a was synthesized
as 5′-CACCGACTCCGGGTCCAGCTCCACTTCAAGA
GAGTGGAGCTGGACCCGGAGTTTT TTTG-3′. NVPBBD130 was purchased from Axon Medchem. Wortmannin

Cell viability and apoptosis assays
HCT-116 or RKO cells were cultured in 96-well
microplate at a density of 5 × 103 cells/well for 24 hours.
The cells were then divided into several groups and treated
with 5-FU, NVP-BEZ235, or their combination. Cell
viability was assessed with CCK-8 (Dojindo Laboratories,
Kumamoto, Japan) at 0, 3, 6, 12 or 24 hours post-treatment
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. OD450, the
absorbance value at 450 nm, was read with a 96-well plate
reader (DG5032, Hua dong, Nanjing, China), to determine
the viability of the cells.
For analysis of apoptosis by nuclear staining, HCT116 cells were cultured on the coverslip of a chamber,
rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then
500 ml DMEM containing 5 μg Hoechst 33342 was
added in, incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 15 minutes.
Apoptosis was assessed through microscopic visualization
of condensed chromatin and micronucleation.

Female 5- to 6-week-old nude mice (Vital River,
China) were housed in a sterile environment with micro
isolator cages and allowed access to water and chow
ad libitum. 1 × 106 cells were resuspended in 100 ul of
PBS (phosphate-buffered saline solution) and injected
subcutaneously into the flanks of nude mice. Once the tumor
was measurable, mice were treated daily with 5-FU at 25
mg/kg by i.p. injection, or 40 mg/kg NVP-BEZ235 by oral
gavage, or their combination. NVP-BEZ235 was dissolved
in NMP/PEG300 (1:9), solicated in NMP firstly, and then
PEG300 was added till the final volume; 5-FU was supplied
as a stock solution. Mice were treated for 7 days a week,
and terminated after 15 days treatment. Tumor growth was
monitored by calipers, and tumor volumes were calculated
according to the formula 0.5 × length × width2. Mice were
euthanized when tumors reached ~1.0 cm3 in size.
