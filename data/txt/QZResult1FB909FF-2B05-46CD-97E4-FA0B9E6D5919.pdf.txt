ABSTRACT
Clinically HER2+ (cHER2+) breast cancer (BC) can no longer be considered a
single BC disease entity in terms of trastuzumab responsiveness. Here we propose
a framework for predicting the response of cHER2+ to trastuzumab that integrates
the molecular distinctions of intrinsic BC subtypes with recent knowledge on cancer
stem cell (CSC) biology. First, we consider that two interchangeable populations
of epithelial-like, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-expressing and mesenchymallike, CD44+CD24-/low CSCs can be found in significantly different proportions across all
intrinsic BC subtypes. Second, we overlap all the intrinsic subtypes across cHER2+
BC to obtain a continuum of mixed phenotypes in which one extreme exhibits a high
identity with ALDH+ CSCs and the other extreme exhibits a high preponderance of
CD44+CD24-/low CSCs. The differential enrichment of trastuzumab-responsive ALDH+
CSCs versus trastuzumab-refractory CD44+CD24-/low CSCs can explain both the clinical
behavior and the primary efficacy of trastuzumab in each molecular subtype of
cHER2+ (i.e., HER2-enriched/cHER2+, luminal A/cHER2+, luminal B/cHER2+, basal/
cHER2+, and claudin-low/cHER2+). The intrinsic plasticity determining the epigenetic
ability of cHER2+ tumors to switch between epithelial and mesenchymal CSC states
will vary across the continuum of mixed phenotypes, thus dictating their intratumoral
heterogeneity and, hence, their evolutionary response to trastuzumab. Because
CD44+CD24-/low mesenchymal-like CSCs distinctively possess a highly endocytic activity,
the otherwise irrelevant HER2 can open the door to a type of “Trojan horse” approach
by employing antibody-drug conjugates such as T-DM1, which will allow a rapid and
CSC-targeted delivery of cytotoxic drugs to therapeutically manage trastuzumabunresponsive basal/cHER2+ BC. Contrary to the current dichotomous model used
clinically, our model proposes that a reclassification of cHER2+ tumors based on the
spectrum of molecular BC subtypes might inform on their CSC-determined sensitivity
to trastuzumab, thus providing a better delineation of the predictive value of cHER2+
in BC by incorporating CSCs-driven intra-tumor heterogeneity into clinical decisions.

During the past decade, several pathological and
immunohistochemical (IHC) sub-classifications have
been proposed to better characterize the extensive and
heterogeneous molecular features of hormone receptorpositive and triple-negative breast cancer (BC) at the
clinical level [1-9]. This type of classification, however,
has not been extended to clinically HER2+ (cHER2+)
BC. To date, cHER2+ BC, as exclusively determined by
immunohistochemistry of HER2 protein overexpression
and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization of HER2 gene
amplification, has been largely considered a single disease
entity [10-14]. Presumably, this is due to the apparent
dominant role of the HER2 receptor itself on the biology
and clinical behavior of HER2+ cells, as well as on the
almost universal use of the anti-HER2 monoclonal
antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) to therapeutically
manage patients with cHER2+ tumors. Interestingly, the
importance of HER2 to distinguish a unique BC subtype
might be rather low when compared to the magnitude of
the BC genome expression as a whole. In other words,
the distinct and intrinsic molecular subtypes (luminal
A, luminal B, HER2-enriched [HER2e], basal-like, and
claudin-low) appear to retain their biological function
and, more importantly, their clinical outcome, regardless
of the cHER2+ status [15]. However, although the
prognostic value of cHER2+ appears to disappear when
the molecular subtype is taken into consideration, little is
known about how the co-presence of a given molecular
subtype might provide independent predictive information
for trastuzumab benefit beyond cHER2+ status.

ductal BC, we recently reported 16% of cHER2+ cases
presenting a basal-HER2+ phenotype established solely
on expression of the basal marker CK5/6 [22]. Beyond
IHC-based sub-classification studies, Prat et al. [15]
used molecular data derived from DNA, RNA, and
protein to determine intrinsic BC subtypes in more than
1,700 patients not treated with trastuzumab. This study
confirmed that cHER2+ BC had a 14.1% frequency of
the intrinsic basal-like subtype, while a similar likelihood
(14.4%) of cHER2+ occurred in intrinsic basal-like
subtypes. Interestingly, within cHER2+ tumors, HER2
gene and protein expression was significantly higher not
only in the HER2-enriched subtype but also in the basallike subtype when compared to luminal BC subtypes. All
of these studies similarly concluded that basal-HER2+
patients have the worst disease-free and overall survival
among all the HER2+ subtypes (i.e., the cHER2+ status
does not add independent prognostic value to the intrinsic
BC subtype), which was even poorer than that of highly
aggressive basal-like BC [17].

AMONG CHER2+ BCS, A BASAL-LIKE
PHENOTYPE PREDICTS THE POOREST
PRIMARY RESPONSE TO TRASTUZUMAB
Beyond confirming the notion that the occurrence
of a basal-HER2+ phenotype can delineate a subgroup of
intrinsically aggressive cHER2+ BC, a recent study by our
group was the first to reveal that basal-HER2+ patients
might not benefit from the addition of trastuzumab on
top of chemotherapy [22]. Accordingly, in the sub-cohort
of HER2+ patients (n = 69) treated with trastuzumabbased adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy, the basal-HER2+
phenotype was found to be the sole independent
prognostic marker for a significantly inferior time to
treatment failure in multivariate analysis. Chung et al. [23]
have recently confirmed that CK5/6 and EGFR expression
are predictive of worse prognosis in HER2+ BC patients
treated with trastuzumab. Given the known association
between the basal-like subtype with stronger responses to
chemotherapy compared with other molecular subtypes,
the higher recurrence rates in basal-HER2+ patients
receiving adjuvant chemotherapy and trastuzumab should
be viewed as the ability of the basal protein expression to
dictate de novo refractoriness to trastuzumab in cHER2+
patients. Although Chung et al. [23] acknowledge that
they failed to identify a significant predictive threshold
for CK5/6 expression, our study established that a simple
CK5/6-based fingerprint using a 10% positivity cutoff
might be used as a strong predictive marker of primary
refractoriness to trastuzumab [22]. These findings build
on the pioneering discoveries in 2007 by Harrys et al.
[16], who demonstrated that a particular HER2+ tumor
phenotype overexpressing genes associated with the
basal-like phenotype, including higher expression of basal
cytokeratins, exhibited intrinsic resistance to pre-operative

THE BASAL-HER2+ SUBTYPE CONFERS
THE POOREST BC PROGNOSIS AMONG
CHER2+ BCS
We are beginning to appreciate that de novo
(primary) resistance to trastuzumab might occur inside
the framework of a mixed BC subtype, in which HER2
overexpression/amplification takes place within a basallike molecular background [16-23]. While it is not yet
clear which IHC markers (e.g., CK5, CK5/6, CK14,
CK17 and/or EGFR), alone or in combination, provide
the greatest accuracy in defining basal-like BC, Chung et
al. [23] have recently described that 37% of 97 patients
with stage 1-3 HER2+ BC expressed at least one basal
marker. When considering the expression of individual
markers, the authors identified 15% of CK5/6+/HER2+,
8% of CK14+/HER2+, and 34% of EGFR+/HER2+. A
previous study from the same group reported a basalHER2+ phenotype in 9% of 131 HER2+ tumors when
considering the expression of either CK5/6 or CK14
[19]. In a large series of 713 consecutive hormone
receptor-negative invasive BC, Liu et al. [17] reported
8% of basal-HER2+ cases expressing HER2 and any
of the basal markers CK5/6, CK14, or EGFR. Using
a consecutive series of 152 HER2+ primary invasive

clinical specimens will be required to unambiguously
demonstrate the role of CSCs in clinical resistance
to trastuzumab, we should also acknowledge that
trastuzumab efficacy appears to rely, at least in part, on
its ability to directly target and inhibit CSCs in HER2+
tumors [58-65]. Moreover, HER2 protein itself appears
to be a key driver of CSCs in BC even in the absence
of HER2 overexpression/amplification [60, 64, 65],
which might explain the unexpected clinical efficacy
of adjuvant trastuzumab in cHER2-negative BC [66,
67]. Therefore, if the molecular basis for the clinical
efficacy of trastuzumab is via a CSC targeting-dependent
process, the most direct manner to resolve this scenario
is the counterintuitive proposal of the a priori occurrence
of trastuzumab-resistant HER2+ CSCs exclusively in
basal-HER2+ BC, but not in other HER2+ phenotypes.
That is, “not all HER2+ CSCs are born equal”, because
basal-HER2+ tumors continue to grow not only when
challenged with trastuzumab, but also when treated
with other anti-HER therapies (e.g., the dual EGFR/
HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib [30, 43, 68]).
Alternatively, when considering the plasticity of CSC-like
cellular states in BC [56], perhaps we need to paraphrase
Orwell to rather consider that “all HER2+ CSCs are equal,
but some HER2+ CSCs are more equal than others”. We
here propose a framework for predicting the response
of cHER2+ to trastuzumab that integrates the molecular

THE BASAL-HER2+ MIXED SUBTYPE

MULTIPLE
CSCRELATED MECHANISMS OF RESISTANCE
TO TRASTUZUMAB
There is an ever-expanding body of literature
documenting possible mechanisms of escape from
trastuzumab that share many of the same markers and
signaling pathways implicated in the biology of drugresistant cancer stem cells (CSCs) [24-44]. Given that
enrichment for CSC-like features is a well-known
molecular hallmark of highly aggressive basal-like BC
[45-57], it is reasonable to propose a causal link between
the presence of basal markers (e.g., CK5/6), an augmented
CSC activity, and primary resistance to trastuzumab in
basal-HER2+ disease. Indeed, earlier studies from our
group and others have repeatedly described that basalHER2+ cells exhibiting de novo resistance to trastuzumab
distinctively amass a majority of the known mechanisms
for trastuzumab resistance [18, 20, 21, 23, 30, 33, 44],
which are not mutually exclusive (Figure 1). The key
mediators of these mechanisms are closely linked to CSCs
[25].
While confirmation of these in vitro findings in

recently acquired data on CSC biology in BC.

highly enriched in CD44+CD24-/low M-CSCs. Moreover,
the gene expression profiles of E-CSCs resemble those
of luminal stem cells, whereas the profiles of M-CSCs
resemble those of basal stem cells in normal breast [56,
77-79]. Given this knowledge and the understanding that
different BC molecular subtypes are characterized by
distinct mutational portraits [80], a unique combination
of genetic and likely also microenvironmental factors will
ultimately contribute to the predominance of each CSC
phenotype in a given cHER2+ tumor type.
We propose that when overlapping each molecular
BC subtype across the continuum of cHER2+, where
one extreme is the complete absence of CD44+CD24-/
low
M-CSCs in HER2-enriched/cHER2+ tumors and the
other extreme is a high preponderance of CD44+CD24-/
low
M-CSCs in basal/cHER2+ and claudin-low/cHER2+
tumors, the differential enrichment of ALDH-expressing
versus CD44+CD24-/low CSCs might explain both the
clinical behavior and the primary efficacy of trastuzumab
in each mixed cHER2+ subtype (Figure 2). On the one
hand, the enrichment of ALDH-expressing E-CSCs

INTRINSIC MOLECULAR SUBTYPES,
CSCS STATES AND HER2+ BC:
RETHINKING THE PROGNOSTICPREDICTIVE VALUE OF CHER2+ TUMORS
Breast CSCs appear to exist in two different, but
reversible and therefore interchangeable, epithelial
(E)- and mesenchymal (M)-like states [56]; the first
state characterized by the expression of aldehyde
dehydrogenase (ALDH) [58, 69-73], and the second state
characterized by the CD44+CD24-/low immunophenotype
[74-76]. Importantly, while these distinct CSC
populations can be found across all the molecular/
intrinsic BC subtypes, their proportion varies significantly.
Accordingly, the number of ALDH-expressing E-CSCs
is significantly higher in HER2-enriched (HER2e) and
luminal B BC, while basal-like and claudin-low BC are

in HER2e/cHER2+ and luminal B/cHER2+ subtypes
might contribute to the known poor clinical outcome
of BC co-overexpressing ALDH and HER2 [81, 82].
Simultaneously, given that efficacy of trastuzumab
appears to relate directly to its ability to drastically
reduce the fraction of ALDH-positive cells in HER2+
BC cell populations (i.e., CSC populations defined by
high ALDH express the highest HER2 levels and remain
exquisitely sensitive to trastuzumab treatment, whereas
HER2+ BC cell populations exhibiting primary resistance
to trastuzumab maintain an intact population of ALDH+
cells following trastuzumab treatment [58]), HER2e/
cHER2+ and luminal B/cHER2+ BC will be the mixed
phenotype which will benefit greatest from trastuzumab
(Figure 2). If the highest preponderance of ALDHexpressing E-CSCs occurs in the HER2e/cHER2+ and
luminal B/cHER2+ BC subtypes and not in the luminal
A/cHER2+ subtype, this model could also explain why a
minority of patients with cHER2+ BC have an excellent
prognosis even in the absence of treatment [83, 84]. On
the other hand, the enrichment of CD44+CD24-/low M-CSCs
may contribute to the highly aggressive clinical behavior
of the basal/cHER2+ phenotype since CD44+CD24-/low
cells will endow this subtype with a mesenchymal-related
enhancement of BC progression [85-87]. Simultaneously,
since the enrichment of mesenchymal traits results in
a highly refractory response to the anti-tumor actions
of trastuzumab [20, 21, 30, 33], the basal/cHER2+ and
claudin-low/cHER2+ BC will be the phenotypes with less
benefit from this treatment.

luminal origin will be more refractory, but still capable, for
loss of an epithelial-like state, whereas basal/cHER2+ and
claudin-low/cHER2+ BC will be inherently poised to gain
a mesenchymal-like state. Indeed, our proposed model can
readily accommodate the current available data regarding
the occurrence of trastuzumab refractoriness driven by the
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenomenon
[20, 21, 34, 88-92].
JIMT-1 was the first commercial cell line established
from a HER2+ patient with intrinsic resistance to
trastuzumab, and is naturally enriched for a CD44+CD24-/
low
mesenchymal state. Interestingly, the subpopulation
of trastuzumab-refractory basal/HER2+ JIMT-1
cells exhibiting CD44+CD24-/low 	
M-CSC-like surface
markers changes over time [30]. Whereas low-passage
cultures contain ≈10% of cells with the CD44+CD24-/
low
immunophenotype, late-passage JIMT-1 cultures
accumulate ≈80% of CD44+CD24-/low cells, thus exhibiting
an almost perfect identity to the CD44+CD24-/low-enriched
phenotype constitutively occurring in the commonly
HER2-negative claudin-low subtype [90-92]. Resistance
to trastuzumab (and lapatinib) has been shown to occur
when HER2+ cells spontaneously switch from a luminal to
a claudin-low phenotype following EMT [93]. The natural
ability to acquire a trastuzumab-refractory EMT phenotype
might however be higher in HER2+ cells lacking some
key epithelial markers such as estrogen receptor and
E-cadherin, and are therefore poised to acquire a new
mesenchymal state. In contrast, HER2+ cells expressing
high levels of markers typical of the luminal phenotype
will maintain their trastuzumab-responsive epitheliallike phenotype. Thus, when contemplating a continuum
of epithelial-like and mesenchymal-like CSC states
throughout the overlapping molecular BC subtypes in
cHER2+, it becomes obvious that the EMT phenomenon
is a pivotal mechanism that, when activated, convergently
drives primary and secondary resistance to HER2-targeted
therapies (for a more detailed explanation of how the
EMT phenomenon impacts intra-tumor heterogeneity and
trastuzumab efficacy in cHER2+ BC, see BOX1).
It is noteworthy that the de novo enrichment of EMT
traits, which appears to be a major determinant of primary
resistance to trastuzumab in basal/cHER2+ BC cells, and
the spontaneous acquisition of EMT traits, which may
constitute a major determinant of acquired resistance to
trastuzumab in HER2e and luminal (A and B)/cHER2+
BC cells, both converge on a significant decrease in
HER2 expression. Our work showed that the spontaneous
enrichment of the CD44+/CD24-/low CSC-mesenchymal
phenotype in basal/HER2+ cells was coincidental with a
global decrease in HER2 expression [30]. Using luminalHER2+ BC cells, Lesniak et al. [93] reported that the
spontaneous conversion of trastuzumab-responsive
luminal/HER2+ cells to a trastuzumab-refractory CD44+/
CD24-/low phenotype through EMT was accompanied by
a strong down-regulation of HER2. These findings may

MESENCHYMAL CSC CELLULAR STATES
AND TRASTUZUMAB RESISTANCE:
PREDICTING THE CLINICAL BEHAVIOR
OF CHER2+
Our current framework of CSC-driven primary
efficacy of trastuzumab in cHER2+ also incorporates the
idea that breast CSCs have an intrinsic plasticity allowing
the transition between the epithelial-like (ALDH+) state
and the mesenchymal-like (CD44+CD24-/low) state. These
reversible transitions might endow cHER2+ tumors with
a plastic capacity for tissue invasion, dissemination, and
growth at metastatic sites, thus ultimately determining the
prognosis of each mixed cHER2+ subtype. Alternatively,
the ability of CSCs to transit from a trastuzumabresponsive epithelial-like state to a trastuzumab-refractory
mesenchymal-like state might endow cHER2+ with a
plastic degree of responsiveness to trastuzumab, thus
ultimately determining the predictive value of each
cHER2+ subtype. Once again, however, it should be noted
that the degree of plasticity that enables CSCs (and nonCSC) to transit between these states should vary among
each molecular subtype of cHER2+: cHER2+ BC of

have major clinical implications when considering the
discordance rates for HER2 expression between matching
and metastatic tumors [94], and following trastuzumabbased neoadjuvant systemic therapy [95, 96]. Notably,
cHER2+ patients whose metastatic disease has converted
to HER2-negative have a worse overall prognosis [97],
while cHER2+ patients whose residual disease following
treatment with neoadjuvant trastuzumab abrogates HER2
overexpression have a significantly poorer recurrencefree survival (RFS) [98]. If a change in HER2 status
merely reflects the heterogeneity of HER2 expression
within the tumor (i.e., trastuzumab treatment eliminates
HER2-overexpressing clones leaving only HER2-negative
tumor cells upon completion of therapy), it then follows
that trastuzumab should have an equal effect on those
tumors achieving a pathological complete response
and those tumors becoming HER2-negative. However,
the fact that the RFS is significantly better for cHER2+
patients with tumors that retain HER2 overexpression
implies that negativization of HER2 is accompanied by
an increased aggressiveness in residual disease. Basal/
cHER2+ tumors rarely exhibit a uniformly positive basal
cytokeratin expression, but instead show a partiallypositive type (“baso-luminal” [99]) often displaying

a checkerboard-type intratumoral heterogeneity [18].
Therefore, an enrichment of clones or cell clusters
with a high percentage of CSCs displaying a basal/
mesenchymal phenotype and decreased HER2 expression
might explain the poor response of basal/cHER2+ to
trastuzumab, as well as the change in HER2 expression
status (Figure 3). If a major determinant of trastuzumab
resistance in luminal and HER2e/cHER2+ tumors is the
de novo occurrence of EMT phenomena, leading to the
appearance of mesenchymal clones or cell clusters with
a CD44+/CD24-/low/HER2-low phenotype, the selection
pressure of trastuzumab treatment will similarly lead to
the emergence of trastuzumab-refractory mesenchymalCSCs, as well as a shift in the HER2 status of the tumor
(Figure 3, BOX1). Indeed, the plasticity between CSC
types ultimately will result in significant challenges
not only to the efficacy of trastuzumab itself but also
to trastuzumab-based chemotherapy. EMT phenotypic
shifts resulting in increased numbers of M-CSCs will
increase the local recurrence capacity of a given cHER2+
subtype by decreasing proliferation and thus generally
avoiding the activity of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic
agents. By increasing the proportion of trastuzumab- and
chemotherapy-refractory
low-proliferative/quiescent

M-CSCs cells at the invasive edge, a cHER2+ tumor
belonging to a given molecular subtype would also
augment its capacity of entering the circulation and
forming micro-metastases at distant sites. Genetic
diversity, epigenetic activation of signaling pathways, and
the tumor microenvironment will influence, independently
or simultaneously, the plastic capacity of M-CSCs to
transitioning back to a proliferative state driven by
E-CSCs after cessation of treatment, thus mediating local
and metastatic tumor relapses over time (BOX 1).
Forthcoming clinical studies should clarify whether
intratumoral heterogeneity in basal cytokeratins and/or
conventional EMT markers can confirm a crucial role
of HER2-negative M-CSCs in determining trastuzumab
efficacy and patient survival in cHER2+ BC. Available
in vitro data, however, appears to confirm that the degree
of intrinsic plasticity to drive the trastuzumab-refractory
CD44+/CD24-/low mesenchymal CSC state may account
for the de novo resistance to trastuzumab in basal/
cHER2+ BC. Experiments in our laboratory have shown
that trastuzumab-refractory basal/HER2+ JIMT-1 cells
can be converted into trastuzumab-responsive cells by
promoting the conversion of CD44+/CD24-/low M-CSClike states into CD24+ E-CSC-like CSC states [20].
Indeed, the depletion of SLUG, a critical regulator of
epithelial cell identity in breast development and cancer

[100], was sufficient to drastically reduce the percentage
of cells with a trastuzumab-refractory CD44+/CD24-/low
immunophenotype. Moreover, this sensitized the original
basal-HER2+ cell population by increasing the number
of trastuzumab-responsive ALDH-expressing cells
(unpublished observations). The fact that metformininduced preferential killing of CD44+/CD24-/low cells
was similarly sufficient to overcome primary resistance
to trastuzumab in basal/HER2+ xenografts in vivo [33],
lends pharmacological support to the concept that the
relative enrichment in CD44+/CD24-/low M-CSCs is a/the
key determinant of the de novo efficacy of trastuzumab.
Accordingly, diverse molecular mechanisms leading to the
reversal of the mesenchymal phenotype in HER2+ tumors
(e.g., mIR-200c-driven suppression of TGF-β signaling
[101, 102]) have been found to efficiently counteract
trastuzumab resistance and the invasion-metastasis
cascade in cHER2+ BC.

many cHER2+ BC patients ultimately die because of
disease progression. It is thus critical to increase success
rates in the adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting. Unfortunately,
no clear biomarkers have emerged as reliable predictors
of primary resistance to trastuzumab. Although newer
agents are under investigation and are expected to improve
outcomes for early-stage patients in combination with
trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy, at the moment we
cannot offer clinicians clear guidance on solutions that
can be integrated in the daily clinical routine. Because the
biologically-distinct intrinsic BC subtypes appear to retain
their individual molecular characteristics and biological
behavior regardless of cHER2+ status, prospective
studies are needed to test the concept that the overlap

of each molecular BC subtype across the cHER2+ BC
spectrum might generate an a priori prediction model of
response to trastuzumab. In this framework, the known
aggressiveness of the basal-like BC subtype confers not
only worsened outcomes for patients with cHER2 BC,
but also the poorest response to trastuzumab. Contrary to
the current dichotomous clinical model (cHER2+ versus
cHER2-), our model proposes that reclassification of
cHER2+ tumors based on CSC-related markers might
indirectly inform on their CSC-driven refractoriness to
trastuzumab, thus providing a better delineation of the
predictive value of cHER2+ in BC (BOX 1). Indeed,
an equivalent overlapping of the intrinsic BC subtypes
across the continuum of cHER2-negative BC can explain

the apparently paradoxical activity of trastuzumab in
HER2e/cHER2- and luminal/HER2- tumors [66, 67],
which accumulate HER2-dependent (but not due to gene
amplification) ALDH-overexpressing E-CSCs. This can
also explain the inefficiency of trastuzumab in basal/
cHER2- tumors, which accumulate HER2-independent
CD44+/CD24-/low M-CSCs [64, 65]. Because only
strongly ALDH-positive cells show a more aggressive
phenotype typical of E-CSCs [103], it might relevant
to evaluate whether the stem cell biomarker ALDH
could be associated with trastuzumab efficacy in a cutoff-dependent manner in cHER2+ versus cHER2- BC.
Nevertheless, it is important to stress that at least two
key questions need to be answered before a mixed
molecular/clinical classification can be implemented to
aid oncologists in the therapeutic management of HER2+
tumors.
First, it is important to address whether the plastic
transition between trastuzumab-responsive epithelial-like
CSC states and trastuzumab-refractory mesenchymallike CSC states can similarly explain the efficacy of
trastuzumab in the metastatic setting. Although Giordano et
al. [104] reported that patients with HER2+ metastatic BC
have circulating tumor cells (CTCs) undergoing EMT and
enrichment for CSC features, additional studies are needed
to determine whether EMT-CTCs [105-107] and CSCs
have prognostic or predictive value in HER2+ metastatic
BC treated with trastuzumab-based therapy. Interestingly,
overexpression of the putative CSC biomarker beta1integrin, a structural component of basal epithelial
cells, is an independent negative prognostic factor for
tumor progression of HER2+ metastatic BC treated with
trastuzumab-based chemotherapy [108]. Beta1-integrin
is constitutively overexpressed in basal/HER2+ BC cells
with de novo resistance to trastuzumab [21, 109], whereas
the expression of a heavily N-glycosylated variant
of beta1-integrin is activated during the spontaneous
conversion of trastuzumab-sensitive HER2+ luminal
cells to a trastuzumab-unresponsive HER2- claudin-low
phenotype. Our current framework therefore predicts
that a primary basal/cHER2+ or claudin-low/cHER2+
phenotype would likely remain unchanged in metastatic
disease, whereas one should expect a higher degree of
phenotypic conversion during the metastatic evolution of
primary luminal/cHER2+ phenotypes.
Second, a definition of potentially clinically
actionable groupings of cHER2+ BC that improves
prognosis and therapeutic planning, especially in the
sub-class of basal/cHER2+ and claudin-low/cHER2+ BC
patients that are not likely to benefit from trastuzumabbased therapy, should be accompanied by alternative
therapeutics able to eliminate the clinically-critical
tumor cell population of trastuzumab-unresponsive
CSC mesenchymal states. The ability of the antidiabetic drug metformin to suppress self-renewal and
proliferation of trastuzumab-resistant CSCs [33, 110,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

111] is under evaluation in the METTEN study, a phase
II, randomized, open-label, multicentric trial of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and trastuzumab with or without
metformin in women diagnosed with HER2-positive
primary BC [112]. Interestingly, the new antibody-drug
conjugate ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1, Kadcyla®),
which consists of the potent chemotherapeutic DM1
(maytansinoid) coupled to trastuzumab, has been shown
to potently and differentially target trastuzumab-refractory
mesenchymal CSCs [113]. It appears that CD44+/CD24-/
low
cells display a highly endocytic activity, thereby
rendering them particularly sensitive to antibody-drug
conjugates such as T-DM1. Indeed, treatment with T-DM1
not only depleted pre-existing CD44+/CD24-/low cells
at concentrations that failed to affect the bulk of tumor
cells, but also prevented the EMT-mediated induction of
CSC-like properties in differentiated tumor cells [113].
The unanticipated targeting of the mesenchymal state
of CSCs by T-DM1 may indeed explain the efficacy of
this recently approved antibody-drug conjugate against
the outgrowth of trastuzumab-refractory basal/HER2+
BC cells xenotransplanted in animal models [114].
Specifically, because CD44+CD24-/low mesenchymal-like
CSCs distinctively possess a highly endocytic activity, the
otherwise irrelevant HER2 can open the door to a “Trojan
horse” type approach through the employment antibodydrug conjugates such as T-DM1, which will allow a
rapid and CSC-targeted delivery of cytotoxic drugs to
trastuzumab-unresponsive basal/cHER2+ BC (Figure 4).
The extension of BC subtypes in clinical settings
such as triple-negative BC could lead to “orphan” BC
diseases that might complicate the accurate design of
powerful clinical trials with sufficient number of patients.
In contrast, the integration of a straightforward and
inexpensive IHC-based subclassification of cHER2+
BC into “basal-like/cHER2+” and “non-basal/cHER2+”
subtypes is likely to provide better-quality prognostic and
predictive information that might streamline translational
medicine for the treating oncologist. T-DM1 has received
regulatory approval for treatment-refractory HER2+
metastatic or locally advanced BC. Therefore, if T-DM1
or other new CSC-targeting agents now entering clinical
trials might improve clinical outcomes for patients
with trastuzumab-unresponsive basal/cHER2+ BC, the
reclassification of cHER2 tumors based on basal and CSCrelated markers (Figure 5) will undoubtedly lead to further
gains for women diagnosed with cHER2+ BC disease.
Nevertheless, our model proposes that a reclassification
of cHER2+ tumors based on the spectrum of molecular
BC subtypes might inform on their CSC-determined
sensitivity to trastuzumab at the level of individual
tumors (BOX1), thus providing a better delineation of the
predictive value of cHER2+ in BC by incorporating CSCdriven intra-tumor heterogeneity into clinical decisions.

CSC-DRIVEN
TUMOR
HETEROGENEITY AND TRASTUZUMAB
RESISTANCE IN CHER2+ BC

Variations in trastuzumab-responsive versus
trastuzumab-refractory CSC types across the
spectrum of cHER2+ BC

One of the greatest challenges for BC therapy is
the occurrence of intra-tumor cellular heterogeneity [115118], which negatively affects the efficacy of different
approaches to cancer treatment including biological
agents such as the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody
trastuzumab (Herceptin). Although the mechanisms
driving intratumoral variation of cellular function have
remained uncertain until recently, we are accumulating
ever-growing evidence that genetic diversity, epigenetics,
and the tumor microenvironment ultimately determine
the integrated functioning of molecular programs that
govern and maintain CSCs across the diverse molecular
subtypes of BC [119, 120]. In our current CSC-based
framework of primary resistance to trastuzumab in
cHER2+ BC, genetic (i.e., mutational landscape) and
non-genetic (i.e., epigenetic and microenvironmental)
mechanisms collectively but differentially contribute
to tumor heterogeneity of cHER2+ tumors belonging to
each molecular subtype of cHER2+ BC (i.e., luminal A/
cHER2+, luminal B/cHER2+, HER2-enriched/cHER2+,
basal/cHER2+, and claudin-low/cHER2+; Figure B1-1).

Beyond the mutation profile as a source of genetic
heterogeneity in the distinct molecular subtypes of
cHER2+ tumors, another level of epigenetic heterogeneity
arises from the nature of the cells that are responsible for
tumor maintenance and progression in each cHER2+ BC
subtype, i.e., the so-called CSCs. Despite the diversity of
genetic changes driving the different molecular subtypes,
two different types of CSCs exist in any of the cHER2+
BC subtypes: a more proliferative, epithelial-like state
characterized by the expression of the CSC marker ALDH,
and a more quiescent and invasive, mesenchymal-like
state characterized by the expression of the CD44+CD24-/
low
immunophenotype [56, 120] (Figure B1-2). This
apparently paradoxical phenomenon is suggestive of
common, shared regulatory pathways capable of directing
self-renewal and differentiation of solely two major
types of CSCs regardless of the intrinsic molecular BC
subtype in which they reside. Remarkably, however,
each molecular subtype of cHER2+ BC is expected to
exhibit significantly different frequencies of trastuzumabresponsive epithelial CSCs (E-CSCs) and trastuzumabrefractory mesenchymal CSCs (M-CSCs). Thus, claudinlow/cHER2+ and basal/cHER2+ subtypes should contain
a significant proportion of trastuzumab-unresponsive
CD44+CD24-/low-expressing M-CSCs, the HER2e/cHER2+
subtype will be characterized by a high proportion of
trastuzumab-sensitive ALDH-positive E-CSCs, the
luminal B/cHER2 would contain a lower proportion of
CSCs than HER2e/cHER2+, basal/cHER2+, and claudinlow/cHER2+ subtypes, and the luminal A/cHER2 subtype
will display the lowest proportion of cells expressing any
CSC marker.

SOURCES OF CSC-RELATED TUMOR
HETEROGENEITY IN CHER2+ BC
Cellular origin and mutation profile across the
spectrum of cHER2+ BC
Each molecular subtype of cHER2+ BC has a
different cell-of-origin (e.g., mammary stem cells, bipotent
progenitors, luminal progenitors, late luminal progenitors
or more committed, differentiated luminal cells), which
may represent a stage of developmental arrest for a
cHER2+ tumor with an origin earlier in the differentiation
hierarchy or, alternatively, transformation of a cell type
at one specific stage of development in the normal breast
tissue [91, 121, 122]. In addition to having different cells
of origin, the different molecular subtypes of cHER2+ BC
are characterized by different mutational profiles. Thus,
beyond the overexpression/amplification of HER2 shared
among all of them, each of the molecular subtypes of
cHER2+ BC have a different mutational landscape [123126], e.g., whereas the most frequent genetic alteration
expected to be found in luminal A/cHER2+ BC is the
mutational activation of PI3K signaling, basal/cHER2+
and claudin-low/cHER2+ BC subtypes almost always
contain mutations in TP53 as well as genomic alterations
in PTEN (Figure B1-2).

Plasticity of E- and M-CSC states and acquisition
of trastuzumab-refractory M-CSC-like states
The bidirectional transition between E- and
M-CSC states is mediated by plastic, EMT/MET-related
epigenetic alterations contextually regulated by signals
originating mostly in the tumor microenvironment (e.g.,
cytokines/chemokines), transcriptional regulation (e.g.,
microRNAs), or some combination thereof [56, 120, 127131]. Two types of differentiated tumor cells are derived
from the E- and M-CSC states: An epithelial type produced
by E-CSCs, which are common in most of the cHER2+
subtypes, and mesenchymal bulk tumor cells derived
from M-CSCs, which are rare in the majority of cHER2+
subtypes (i.e., luminal A/cHER2+, luminal B/cHER2+
and HER2e/cHER2+) but observable or common in the
basal/cHER2+ and claudin-low/cHER2+ subtypes. While
the epithelial or mesenchymal bulk cell progeny will

secrete signals to positively reinforce the self-renewal of
their corresponding parental E- and M-CSCs, it should be
noted that more stem-like or mesenchymal phenotype cells
can appear, and shift, at any time during tumor evolution,
leading to mixed cell populations in cHER2+ tumors with
respect to more epithelial cell properties. Thus, non-stem,
bulk epithelial tumor cells in any of the cHER2+ subtypes
of luminal origin can undergo an EMT phenotypic shift
resulting in increased numbers of trastuzumab-refractory
M-CSCs, which naturally occur at high numbers in the
claudin-low/cHER2+ subtype originating from less
committed mammary stem cells.
Moreover, there is evidence that more differentiated
tumor cells may acquire CSC properties through nuclear
reprogramming-like dedifferentiation phenomena; the
range or probability of dedifferentiation rates of bulk
tumor cells into CSC-like states [132-137], however,
is expected to be inversely proportional to the number
of cellular generations removed from being a CSC.
Although all these closely related mechanisms can de
novo repopulate CSCs in trastuzumab-treated cHER2+
BC, the intrinsic capacity to lower the epigenetic barriers
responsible for cellular plasticity will vary across the
molecular subtypes of cHER2+ tumors, thus determining
not only their varying proportions of the two E- and
M-states of CSCs, but also the proclivity to generate CSC
states via the EMT or dedifferentiation phenomena (Figure
B1-2).

to accrue epithelial characteristics, or non-CSC and CSClike epithelial cells to accrue mesenchymal characteristics.
Altered chromatin patterns during cancer development
would be a factor for evolution of cellular heterogeneity
[138] by helping to lock in specific tumor phenotypes.
On the one hand, the development of cHER2+ BC with
a luminal phenotype, which derives from committed
cell compartments in normal breast epithelium, may
evolve over a longer time course with more chromatin
evolution from bivalency to a more stable cancer-specific
promoter DNA hypermethylation. On the other hand, the
development of cHER2+ BC with a claudin-low or basal
phenotype, which derives from a more primitive and/or
less committed normal breast epithelial compartment,
might arise faster with cell phenotypes more dependent
on the retention of a more plastic, epigenetically poised
(bivalent) control of chromatin states.
Crucially, for our current framework of CSCdriven primary resistance to trastuzumab, such bivalent
modification at specific gene promoters, which facilitate
the rapid dedifferentiation of phenotypically plastic
cells to stem-like cells [127-130], would permit basaltype HER2+ cells to respond to the same stimulus in a
qualitatively different manner than luminal type of HER2+
cells. At least some of the non-stem, bulk epithelial cells
of basal/cHER2+ will be a priori poised to rapidly become
dedifferentiated into M-CSC-like states. Thus, in response
to certain microenvironments rich in EMT-inducing
heterotypic signals, basal/cHER2+ are intrinsically
expected to more rapidly switch to trastuzumab-refractory
M-CSC-like states than cHER2+ tumors of luminal
origin. Because the gain of an increasingly stable M-CSC
phenotype is apparently dependent on the sustained
presence of potent EMT-reinforcing signals [127-130],
in their absence, M-CSCs may naturally revert to a more
epithelial phenotype unless they are supported by the
appropriate epigenetic modification. Therefore, because
basal/cHER2+ tumors and cHER2+ tumors of luminal
origin are also differentially enriched with CD44+ stem
cells exhibiting bivalent chromatin configurations in
E-cadherin and other epithelial-specific genes, they will
also exhibit an intrinsically enhanced capacity to rapidly
dedifferentiate into a CD24+ proliferative epithelial state
following trastuzumab withdrawal.
M-CSCs can stably maintain their residence in the
mesenchymal state through the activation of autocrine
signaling loops that liberate M-CSCs from dependence on
continuous paracrine EMT-inducing signals originating
elsewhere within tissues [127-130]. This scenario may
naturally occur in the claudin-low/cHER2+ subtype, in
which the stable residence in a mesenchymal state will
involve a highly stable silencing of key epithelial genes
via DNA hypermethylation. This can be inherited with
high fidelity over the course of multiple successive
divisions. Nevertheless, a full spectrum of less-plastic
DNA hypermethylated to highly plastic poised states of

Intrinsic subtype-dependent plasticity of CSCs in
cHER2+ BC
Dedifferentiation and reprogramming, two highly
related versions of cancer cellular plasticity that can
generate heterogeneity across the different molecular
subtypes of cHER2+ BC through evolutionary time, will
substantially but differentially reduce the effectiveness of
trastuzumab across the spectrum of cHER2+ BC subtypes.
In other words, although these mechanisms, altogether,
could certainly contribute to the emergence of new clones
in cHER2+ tumors with respect to plasticity for evolution
and/or reversibility of tumor-initiating and self-renewal
CSC-like properties, their dynamics will be intrinsically
constrained not only by their inherited epigenetic
programming (i.e., the cell compartments from which a
given cHER2+ subtype arises), but also by the specific
genetic portraits of each molecular BC subtype.
Epigenetic mechanisms
Chromatin state shifts may be vital to dictate
plasticity in HER2+ BC cells because bivalent chromatin,
i.e., simultaneous maintenance of both active and repressed
marks at promoter regions of developmental genes [127130], may hold genes in a so-called poised state that, if
activated by specific microenvironmental signals, would
either allow non-CSC and CSC-like mesenchymal cells

chromatin will occur not only throughout the continuum
of cHER2+ molecular subtypes but also to different
extents in individual tumors, thus adding another layer
of epigenetic complexity to intratumor heterogeneity in
cHER2+ BC.

heterogeneity may ultimately dictate how new genomic
alterations acquired over time may de novo generate
new CSCs as well as clones of differentiated progeny
to differentially generate cellular heterogeneity in the
natural history of individual tumors belonging to each
molecular subtype of cHER2+ BC. That is to say, more
poised epigenetic states in individual tumors belonging
to certain subtypes of HER2+ tumor cells might generate
higher degrees of diversity in gene expression patterns that
can rapidly evolve through trastuzumab selection during
treatment, thus driving multistep epigenetic fixation of
gene expression in response to trastuzumab-based therapy.

Genetic mechanisms
Beyond epigenetic diversity-mediated tolerance
to trastuzumab, bona fide genetic mechanisms for drug
resistance classically considered to solely affect the
bulk cell populations might also augment CSC-driven
heterogeneity in cHER2+ BC if such mutations lead to
an increase in the frequency of trastuzumab-refractory
M-CSC-like states. Because cHER2+ may consist of
different sub-clones that carry a founder mutation(s) alone
or additional acquired mutations that confer trastuzumabresistant states, a pre-existing trastuzumab-resistant clone
may remain unaffected and through outgrowth can come
to dominate the entire cancer population.
For instance, in situ single-cell analyses are
beginning to illuminate the fact that the frequency and
topology of HER2 gene amplification and other key
accompanying driving mutations such as PIK3CA
significantly varies before and after treatment with
chemotherapy. Of note, chemotherapy treatment appears
to drastically modulate genetic diversity within HER2+
tumors by selecting for PIK3CA1-mutant cells, a minor
subpopulation in treatment-naïve samples. Because
activating mutations in PIK3CA, which are commonly
associated with resistance to HER2-targeting agents [140143], induce breast tumor heterogeneity by evoking cell
dedifferentiation into multipotent stem-like states and
promoting different cell fate switches [144, 145], their
selection upon treatment with chemotherapeutic agents
or other microenvironmental stresses might drastically
accelerate tumor relapse and metastatic progression by
altering the initial intrinsic phenotype of cHER2+ BC and
generating M-CSC-like states refractory to anti-HER2
therapies [146]. Because mutations are shared between
CSCs and their clonal progeny, the fact that intratumoral
cell heterogeneity significantly increases in the spectrum
of luminal-to-basal subtypes can explain how genetic
and epigenetic heterogeneity can coalesce at the CSC
level to differentially affect tumor evolution and clinical
progression in individual tumors belonging to each
cHER2+ molecular subtype (Figure B1-2).
In this integrated view, the genetic and CSC-based
developmental and/or hierarchical models of BC, often
considered as mutually exclusive when describing tumor
heterogeneity, can be harmonized by considering the CSC
state as a central biological property or epigenetic process
upon which different mutational profiles across the
subtypes of cHER2+ BC coalesce. Moreover, an intrinsic
subtype-dependent degree of plastic, epigenetically poised
(bivalent) chromatin states combined with an intrinsic
subtype-dependent degree of intratumoral cell-to-cell

THERAPEUTIC IMPLICATIONS OF
CSCS-RELATED INTRA-TUMOR CELL
HETEROGENEITY IN CHER2+ BC
The development of specific, individualized
therapeutic strategies has emphasized genomic and
phenotypic differences between major BC subtypes
but has largely been designed to target bulk tumor cell
populations. Interestingly, the HER2-targeting antibody
trastuzumab likely represents the sole currently available
agent that simultaneously targets the bulk epithelial
tumor population and the epithelial type of CSCs in BC.
Unexpectedly, this will confound stratified treatment
decisions (i.e., trastuzumab-based therapy) that are solely
based on one sole mutation biomarker (i.e., HER2 gene
amplification/HER2 protein overexpression). Indeed, the
optimum therapeutic benefit of trastuzumab-based HER2
blockade will arise when the successful reduction of both
HER2+ bulk tumor epithelial populations and HER2+-ECSC takes place in an individual cHER2+ tumor (Figure
B1-3). Conversely, poorer responses are a priori expected
in tumors belonging to cHER2+ subtypes enriched with
trastuzumab-unresponsive non-CSC mesenchymal bulk
tumor cells and M-CSCs (i.e., basal/cHER2+ and claudinlow/cHER2+), or in those with an increased proclivity to
alter their initial intrinsic phenotype.
