ABSTRACT
Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK)α converts diacylglycerol to phosphatidic acid. This
lipid kinase sustains survival, migration and invasion of tumor cells, with no effect over
untransformed cells, suggesting its potential as a cancer-specific target. Nonetheless
the mechanisms that underlie DGKα specific contribution to cancer survival have
not been elucidated. Using three-dimensional (3D) colon and breast cancer cell
cultures, we demonstrate that DGKα upregulation is part of the transcriptional
program that results in Src activation in these culture conditions. Pharmacological
or genetic DGKα silencing impaired tumor growth in vivo confirming its function in
malignant transformation. DGKα-mediated Src regulation contributed to limit the
effect of Src inhibitors, and its transcriptional upregulation in response to PI3K/Akt
inhibitors resulted in reduced toxicity. Src oncogenic properties and contribution to
pharmacological resistance have been linked to its overactivation in cancer. DGKα
participation in this central node helps to explain why its pharmacological inhibition
or siRNA-mediated targeting specifically alters tumor viability with no effect on
untransformed cells. Our results identify DGKα-mediated stabilization of Src activation
as an important mechanism in tumor growth, and suggest that targeting this enzyme,
alone or in combination with other inhibitors in wide clinical use, could constitute a
treatment strategy for aggressive forms of cancer.

INTRODUCTION

processes, and the exact tumor context for which DGKα
is an effective target have not been elucidated.
DGKα function is regulated by transcriptional and
post-transcriptional mechanisms. Distinct routes converge
and are integrated at the DGKα gene promoter region,
including those of PI3K/Akt/FoxO, p53 and Ras [12-14].
DGKα is a cytosolic enzyme, and its phosphorylation by
distinct members of the Src family kinases (SFK) lead to
its recruitment to the plasma membrane and activation
[15-18]. SFK are non-receptor tyrosine kinases that
share a common modular structure including a SH3 and
a SH2 domains involved in protein interactions, and
a myristoylation site at the N-terminus for membrane
targeting [19]. In vitro experiments with GST (glutathione
S-transferase)-purified DGKα and recombinant Src

The diacylglycerol kinases (DGK) phosphorylate
diacylglycerol (DAG) to produce phosphatidic acid (PA);
DGK thus regulate the levels of two lipids with key roles
in signaling and metabolic pathways [1]. Many reports
support a positive role for the DGKα isoform in cancer
progression. This lipid kinase assists tumor survival [24], migration and invasion [5-7]. DGKα expression is
increased in tumors compared to adjacent non-cancerous
tissue [3, 4], as well as in metastasis of the original tumor
[8, 9]. When mutated, it is a causative gene in pancreatic
cancer [10], and was recently described as a potential
target for glioblastoma treatment [11]. Nonetheless,

mapped DGKα interactions with Src SH2 and SH3 regions
[18].
Src is the most widely expressed member of the
SFK family and is relevant in many cancer types, since it
controls tumor cell proliferation, survival, migration and
invasion [20, 21]. Src regulates mitogenic and survival
signaling cascades downstream of receptors tyrosine
kinase (RTK), which are frequently mutated and/or
overexpressed in breast and colon cancer. Oncogenic Src
functions are also related to its activation downstream
of integrins to regulate survival and invasion [22]. Src
activity is predictive of poor clinical prognosis in colon
and pancreatic cancer [23, 24]. These findings have led
to substantial efforts to test the therapeutic potential
of Src inhibitors in advanced cancers such as breast
and colon, which are very frequent tumor types and
tend to present early relapse and metastasis. Although
preclinical evidence supported the use of such inhibitors,
its therapeutic effectiveness as single agents in clinical
assays for solid tumors has been discouraging [25]. This is
probably due to incomplete knowledge of the mechanisms
that control Src transforming potential and of the cancerrelated Src-regulated pathways. Src is involved in many
fundamental cellular processes, but the Src deficient mice
are viable [26]. In contrast to viral oncoproteins, Src alone
is insufficient to transform cells in vitro, and activating
mutations of SFK are rarely observed in cancer [27, 28],
suggesting further control by specific Src regulators that
promote or restrain its tumorigenic properties [29, 30].
Here we tested the hypothesis that DGKα expression
in tumor cells contributes to oncogenic SFK functions.
We analyzed the DGKα contribution to breast and colon
cancer in 3D cell cultures. These culture conditions closely
mimic the in vivo cell environment and have been used
to demonstrate the activation of transcription programs
that lead to tumor survival and drug resistance [31-33].
Tumor cell growth in 3D culture is particularly dependent
on integrin and Src signaling cascades, a property that it is
not recapitulated in 2D conditions nor in non-transformed
cells [34]. We found that DGKα silencing or inhibition
prevented cancer cell growth in 3D culture as well as
tumor growth in vivo. Analysis of DGKα expression and
Src activation under 3D conditions provided a mechanistic
link by showing that DGKα expression has a positive
regulatory function in Src activation. DGKα contribution
to this central node helps to explain why targeting of
DGKα specifically alters tumor viability, with no effect
on untransformed cell survival. We identified DGKα as
a Src-interacting partner that is necessary to sustain Src
signaling and whose targeting improved the effect of Src
and PI3K/Akt inhibitors. Our findings indicate that DGKα
might be an effective target for anti-cancer therapies, alone
or in combination with other widely used inhibitors.

DGKα is necessary for cancer cell growth in 3D
culture
DGKα has been studied in several cancer models,
where experimental evidence has shown that it mediates
various aspects of cancer cell progression. No studies have
addressed the contribution of this isoform to colon cancer
so we selected the SW480 cell line, which was derived
from a primary colorectal tumor and shows characteristics
of highly transformed cells. The contribution of DGKα to
the tumoral properties of SW480 cells was addressed by
reducing its expression using interferent RNA. Previous
validated DGKα target sequence [35, 36] efficiently
reduced the expression of the protein in SW480 cells
(Fig. S1A). Expression of DGKζ, an isoform that
complements some DGK functions in T lymphocytes,
was not altered in DGKα silenced cells (Fig. S1A). To
evaluate the contribution of DGKα during long-term
culture, the targeting sequence was cloned as shRNA in
the pSuperRetro vector; this was then used to generate
cells with stable reduction of DGKα levels (Fig. S1B).
The effect of DGKα downmodulation on longterm growth of SW480 cells was evaluated in matrigel
3D culture and on plastic, 2D culture conditions. In 3D
culture, SW480 cells showed a disorganized structure
with poor cell-cell contacts, characteristic of highly
transformed tumors [37]. Reduced DGKα expression in
3D cultures of the stably downregulated SW480 cells was
corroborated by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1A). When
compared to their control counterpart, cells with reduced
DGKα levels formed smaller colonies (Fig. 1B). DGKα
attenuation impaired cell proliferation, as revealed the
reduced number of cells incorporating EdU (5-ethynyl-2
deoxyuridine), a thymidine analogue that measures DNA
synthesis (Fig 1C).
Reduction of DGKα protein levels did not
significantly affect cell growth in 2D; these cells formed
colonies at the same extent that control cells (Fig. S2A).
The effect of reduced DGKα expression on cell growth in
either 2D or 3D conditions was compared by measuring
cell viability with a tetrazolium reduction based assay
(MTS). Simultaneous MTS measurements confirmed that
DGKα silencing affected the viability of SW480 cells only
when in 3D (Fig. S2B). These observations indicate that
DGKα, whereas dispensable for 2D cell growth, is central
for sustaining cancer cell growth in a 3D context.
Cancer cell growth in 3D induces tumorigenic traits
that cells display in vivo and are not recapitulated in 2D
culture. The contribution of DGKα to SW480 growth
in 3D suggests that this enzyme could be of interest for
cancer therapy. To study the potential of this pathway as a
target for pharmacological intervention, we next compared

the effect of diminishing DGKα protein levels with that
produced by a pharmacological inhibitor. We selected
the DGK inhibitor II (R59949) that binds to and blocks
DGKα catalytic functions [38]. R59949 is reported to
be more efficient that the other DGK inhibitor (R59022)
in blocking the Ca2+-dependent type I DGK isoforms in
vitro, mainly DGKα. R59949 inhibits purified DGKα in
the low micromolar range [38], but it is highly lipophilic
and tends to be sequestered by serum lipids when added to
cell cultures [39]. By this reason the drug is used in serum-

free culture conditions or, if serum is present, higher
concentrations must be used. In this case R59949 may
also inhibit other DGK isoforms [40]. 3D assays required
long-term cell culture in serum-supplemented media so we
first assessed the expression of additional DGK isoforms
in SW480 cells.
Data from our related studies indicated that in
addition to DGKα, SW480 cells also expressed DGKζ
(Fig. S1B). Due to the lack of efficient commercial antiDGK antibodies, we tested the expression of the remaining

DGK isoforms by RT-PCR. This analysis indicated that
SW480 cells also expressed type II DGKδ and DGKη, and
type III DGKε; but not type IV DGKι or type V DGKθ
(Fig. S3A). To discard that in our experimental conditions,
R59949 could inhibit not only DGKα, but also some of
the other expressed DGK, we determined the efficiency
and selectivity of R59949 by comparing its effects over
total DGK activity in control and DGKα silenced cells.
We have previously used 30 µM of the inhibitor to
demonstrate the DGKα-mediated control of hypoxiainducible factor-1α; this same dose has been reported by
other groups to confirm DGK function [41-43]. We thus
cultured SW480 cells for 24 h in complete medium in the
presence of R59949 at 15 and 30 µM. The lower dose had
a minimum effect over total DGK activity, whereas 30 µM
R59949 diminished DGK activity by near 25%. A similar
reduction was observed in cells with DGKα silencing, and
in this case R59949 addition did not further affect activity
(Fig. S3B).
We next investigated if the R59949-resistant
DGK activity in SW480 cells could be ascribed to the
DGKζ isoform that, as we have previously shown, has
a prominent role in controlling total DGK activity in T
cells [36, 44]. We found that DGKζ contribution was
also important in SW480 cells, since its targeting led to a
severe reduction in total DGK activity (Fig. S3B). R59949
addition to DGKζ-silenced cells fully abolished DGK
activity, confirming the drug sensitivity of the remaining
isoforms, most probably DGKα, in these cells. This agrees
with previous reports indicating the high sensitivity of
DGKα to R59949 [38, 40], and further indicates that this
isoform is the main target of R59949 in these cells.
The effect of pharmacological DGK inhibition was
next assessed using SW480 cells growing in 3D. As for
DGKα depletion, R59949 treatment of matrigel-plated
SW480 cells reduced colony formation (Fig 1D, upper
panel). Results were similar for the breast cancer cell
line MDA-MB-468, which showed spheroid-like growth
with grape-like morphology [37] (Fig. 1D, lower panels).
Quantification of EdU incorporation confirmed that,
as shown for DGKα silenced cells, R59949 treatment
diminished proliferation in the two cell lines (Fig. 1D).
Different from these two highly transformed cells,
some cell lines form well-organized acinar-like structures
that resemble normal epithelia when cultured under 3D
conditions [37]. To be appropriate for clinical use, DGKα
inhibition should have little or no effect on untransformed
cell growth. We next tested the effect of DGKα inhibition
on the Caco-2 cell line that, although it is classified as
colon cancer, forms acinar-like structures in matrigel
culture and is widely used to study colon morphogenesis
[45]. R59949-induced DGKα inhibition did not affect the
acinar-like morphology of these cells that grew at the same
extent that vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 1E, S2C). R59949
had no effect on the polarized growth of MCF-10A cells,
a breast-derived cell line that forms organized structures in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

3D culture [46], Fig.1E, S2C). These data indicate that the
disorganized growth characteristics of transformed cells
require DGKα.

DGKα depletion impairs tumor growth in vivo
Silencing of DGKα had no effect on cancer cell
growth in 2D culture, at difference from that observed
when cells were cultured in 3D. This characteristic
suggests that DGKα sustains three-dimensional
configuration in vitro, and thus possibly in vivo. We next
examined the contribution of DGKα to maintain 3D
growth in vivo, using DGKα silenced SW480 colon cancer
cells in xenograft assay models. Mice injected with stably
silenced DGKα SW480 cells developed tumors, but they
appeared later and grew less compared to control cells
(Fig. 2A). Tumors generated upon injection of DGKα
silenced cells were smaller and weighted ~50% less than
those of control cells (Fig. 2B, C). Western blot analysis
of tumor lysates confirmed that DGKα silencing was
maintained along the experiment (Fig. 2D).
To evaluate the in vivo potential of pharmacological
DGKα targeting, we also determined the effect of the
R59949 inhibitor on SW480 cell xenografts. Our group
has reported that DGK inhibitors and rapamycin have
similar effects over cell proliferation [47]. We thus chose
a dose of 10 mg/kg of the inhibitor; similar to that used
for rapamycin in xenograft assays [48]. In a pilot study,
intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of the corresponding
volume of DMSO or R59949 in DMSO resulted highly
toxic for the mice. We then selected an alternate vehicle
for R59949 administration, using the drug in emulsion
with 50% of PEG3000 in PBS. Again i.p. administration
of PEG either alone or with R59949 was toxic at long
term (50% mice from each group died following the
second dose of treatment). Finally, R59949 in emulsion
with PEG3000 was subcutaneously administrated. Mice
were injected with SW480 cells, tumors were let to grow
and R59949 was first injected when the tumors reached
a volume of approximate 150 mm3. After the initial
injection, the inhibitor was continuously injected every 48
h during 10 days, when tumors in control animals reached
the maximal authorized size (Fig. 2E). This treatment
was not toxic for the animals, as assessed by the lack of
differences in the weight of vehicle and inhibitor treated
mice (Fig. S4). R59949-treatment resulted in marked
reduction of tumor growth (Fig. 2F). The impairment
in tumor growth was statistically significant when the
volume of each individual tumor was normalized to that
measured prior inhibitor injection (Fig. 2G). Although
R59949 treatment did not result in tumor regression,
tumors excised from R59949-treated mice were smaller
and weighted less than those obtained from vehicletreated mice (Fig. 2H, I). Immunohistochemical analysis
revealed reduced Akt phosphorylation and increased
cleaved caspase 3 staining in tumors from R599499713

that pharmacological DGKα inhibition correlated with
impairment of survival pathways and increased apoptosis.

this enzyme along differentiation stages [14]. We thus
investigated if DGKα expression varied as a result of 3D
culture conditions. DGKα mRNA levels were ∼3‑fold
higher in 3D-cultured SW480 cells compared to 2D culture
(Fig. 3A), suggesting 3D-mediated upregulation of DGKα
gene expression. We found correlation between increases
in DGKα mRNA and in the total amount of DGKα
protein (Fig. 3B). Higher DGKα protein levels were also
observed for breast tumor-derived cell lines in 3D cultures
suggesting a direct correlation with 3D imposed restrains
(Fig. S5). An increase in tyrosine signaling networks,
specifically those of the Src family, is a characteristic of
colon and breast cancers [49, 50], and is critical to sustain

DGKα promotes Src activation
Our results suggested that DGKα participates in
a central node that promotes cancer cell growth in a 3D
context. Culture on matrigel matrices closely mimics
the tumor microenvironment and reproduces the cell
reprogramming that occurs in vivo. The DGKα promoter
contains several regulatory regions that, as shown in T
lymphocytes, modulate transcriptional expression of

disorganized growth under 3D conditions [51]. SW480
cells cultured in 3D conditions also showed greater Src
phosphorylation at Y419, an autophosphorylation site that
correlates with optimal Src activity. The increase in Y419
phosphorylation was accompanied by an overall increase
in the phosphotyrosine profile (Fig. 3B).
DGKα is known to be a SFK-regulated target in
T cells, as well as in cells of endothelial and epithelial
origin. A recombinant GST-DGKα version interacts with
and is phosphorylated by recombinant Src [18], and
DGKα membrane recruitment and/or activity are induced
by SFK-phosphorylation [16, 17]. Other Src effectors,
through their association with Src, facilitate an open
conformation of the kinase and thus its activation [52].
As increased Src activation in 3D conditions coincided
with higher DGKα levels, with no obvious change in Src
protein expression, we explored a possible correlation
between DGKα upregulation and Src activation.
Immunoprecipitation assays showed that endogenous
DGKα associated to Src in SW480 cells (Fig. 3C). In these
cells, DGKα silencing correlated with a notable reduction
in Src Y419 phosphorylation, indicating Src inactivation
(Fig. 3D). These observations suggest a mutual regulation
between Src and DGKα where, as described for other
SFK targets, DGKα interaction with Src facilitates Src
activation.
To study in more detail the requirements for Src
and DGKα interaction, we overexpressed both proteins
in HEK293 cells, which do not express DGKα. DGKα
was overexpressed as a Myc-tagged protein, to facilitate
its immunoprecipitation. As observed for the endogenous
proteins, the ectopically expressed DGKα interacted
with Src and phosphotyrosine analysis confirmed DGKα
phosphorylation (Fig. 3E). Treatment with the Src
inhibitor PP2 did not disrupt DGKα−Src interaction,
although it abolished tyrosine phosphorylation of DGKα.
In contrast, treatment with the DGK inhibitor impaired
DGKα−Src interaction (Fig. 3E).
To determine if the lack of DGKα−Src interaction
was a direct consequence of impaired DGK activity, we
examined the interaction of Src with a kinase-deficient
DGKα mutant. DGKα, rendered inactive by mutation
of the conserved, ATP-binding GGDG sequence [53],
interacted with Src and was tyrosine phosphorylated (Fig.
3F). This indicates that DGKα enzymatic activity was
dispensable for its interaction with Src. It also suggests
that R59949-mediated complex disruption is probably the
result of sterically hindrance following inhibitor binding
to the DGKα catalytic domain. Total phosphotyrosine
profile analysis, however, suggested increased Src activity
in cells expressing the active DGKα construct (Fig. 3F),
suggesting some contribution of DGKα activity for full
Src activation.
Determination of Src activation in HEK293 cells
was limited by the high level of ectopically expressed
Src as well as by the expression of additional SFK
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

members (see additional bands in HEK293 lysates). We
thus reconstituted DGKα-silenced SW480 cells with
wild type and kinase-dead DGKα versions (Fig. 3G).
In these conditions, full Src phosphorylation was only
reconstituted by wild type DGKα but not by the kinasedead mutant. This suggests that the enzymatic activity
of DGKα is required to achieve complete activation of
endogenous Src. R59949 treatment mimicked the effect of
DGKα attenuation and resulted in a strong reduction of Src
Y419 phosphorylation (Fig. 3H). Finally, the analysis of
Src activation in tumor lysates from vehicle- and R59949treated mice bearing SW480 induced tumors, confirmed
that treatment with R59949 in vivo also diminished Src
activation (Fig. 3I).

DGKα silencing increases cancer cell sensitivity to
Src inhibition
Despite the importance of Src in malignant
transformation, monotherapy using Src inhibitors in
clinical trials has had only modest results [54]. Aspects
of the 3D tumor environment may contribute to limit
drug effectiveness including the spatial activation of Src
and its regulation by interacting partners. The previous
experiments suggested that DGK inhibitor treatment
impaired DGKα interaction with Src, so we hypothesized
that disruption of DGKα-Src complex could not only
diminish Src activation, but also enhance its sensitivity
to pharmacological inhibitors. Treatment of SW480 cells
with the Src inhibitor PP2 diminished Src phosphorylation
similar to that observed when treating cells with the
DGK inhibitor. The dose of PP2 required to impair Src
phosphorylation was reduced when SW480 cells were cotreated with the DGK inhibitor (Fig. 4A). Decreased Src
phosphorylation correlated with diminished total tyrosine
phosphorylation and reduced expression of Cyclin D3, a
cell cycle promoter that is upregulated in many tumor cells
[55].
The effect of drug combination was also evaluated
in 3D cultures using cleavage caspase 3 as an indicator
of apoptotic cell death. In these experiments PP2 was
assayed at 10 µM, a concentration reported when using
3D conditions to avoid diffusion and lack of effectiveness
due to matrix structure [51]. PP2 treatment at this
concentration partially reduced 3D growth and promoted
apoptosis of SW480 cells (Fig. 4B, C). R59949 promoted
apoptosis to higher extent, independently of PP2 addition
(Fig. 4C). Simultaneous addition of the two inhibitors,
however, affected colony integrity as denoted by the
decrease in the percentage of intact colonies (Fig. 4B and
S6A).
Resistance to Src inhibition has been also attributed
to the presence of additional oncogenic mutations. Lack
of the PTEN phosphatase, a frequent mutation in breast
tumors, enhances Akt activation and phosphotyrosine

signaling, which diminishes the efficacy of drugs that
block RTK or SFK [56]. As for SW480 cells, simultaneous
treatment of the PTEN negative MDA-MB-468 cells
with R59949 and PP2 reduced Src phosphorylation and
Cyclin D3 levels (Fig. 4D). Different from that observed
in SW480 cells, phosphotyrosine profiles did not decrease
accordingly and even some proteins of high molecular

weight showed increased phosphorylation (Fig. 4D). PP2
treatment promoted apoptosis of MDA-MB-468 cells
grown in matrigel, although, as for SW480 cells, cell death
increased if cells were treated with R59949 (Fig. 4E, F).
Combination of PP2 with R59949 significantly increased
apoptosis compared to individual treatments (Fig. 4F), and
also increased the number of colonies with a disintegrated

integrity pattern (Fig. S6B).
Contrary to their previous effects, either individual
or combined addition of R59949 and PP2 did not affect
spheroid formation when added to 3D cultures of Caco2 or MCF-10A cells (Fig. S7). Our data concur with
previous studies showing the synergistic effect of PP2
with other inhibitors acting on the Src pathway in cancer
cells, as has been recently described for PKCα inhibitors
in breast cancer [57]. These findings strongly suggest that
DGKα targeting could render cancer cells sensitive to Src

inhibitors.

DGKα participates in the adaptive response of

DISCUSSION

exit, which blocks their transactivatory function [58].
DGKα function thus lies downstream of the PI3K/Akt
pathway and its function is expected be coupled to the
cell differentiation programs controlled by FoxO family.
Accordingly, DGKα expression in cytotoxic T populations
is repressed by activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway [14].
FoxO factors also control expression of several receptor
and non-receptor tyrosine kinases. Noteworthy, cancer
cells rely on this mechanism to trigger tyrosine kinase
signaling when PI3K or Akt inhibitors are used, which
makes them resistant to the deleterious effects of these
drugs [59, 60].
We tested whether PI3K/Akt inhibition in SW480
colon cancer cells triggered activation of Src and tyrosine
signaling, and if this correlated with transcriptional
upregulation of DGKα. PI3K or Akt-inhibited cell cultures
of SW480 cell showed increases in Src activation and in
total phosphotyrosine profiles (Fig. 5A). DGKα protein
levels increased after 24 h of treatment, a time in which Src
activation reached the maximum grade (Fig. 5A). Since in
3D culture conditions the expression of DGKα was higher
than in 2D, we next determined its levels in this condition
after PI3K inhibition. qPCR analysis of DGKα mRNA
levels in PI3K/Akt-inhibited 3D cell cultures of SW480
cells showed a 3- to 5‑fold increase in DGKα expression
relative to controls (Fig. 5B). By sustaining Src activation,
increased DGKα levels might limit the deleterious effect
of PI3K/Akt inhibitors on tumor survival. In agreement,
combined inhibition of DGK and PI3K diminished
cell growth and increased apoptosis more effectively
than PI3K inhibition alone (Fig. 5C, D). The combined
treatment also led to higher disruption of colony integrity
compared to any of the single treatments (Fig. S6A).
Increases in Src activation and DGKα protein
levels were also observed after PI3K/Akt inhibition in
MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 5E). In these cells the effects
were stronger when the PI3K inhibitor was used instead
of the Akt inhibitor, probably due to the lack of PTEN.
Changes on Src activation where not reflected in these
cells in the total phosphotyrosine profile, differently from
that observed in SW480 cells. In 3D culture conditions,
PI3K inhibition promoted apoptosis at similar extent that
R59949 (Fig. 5F, G), although the combined inhibition
of DGK and PI3K increased the number of colonies with
disintegrated structure (Fig. S6B). Inhibitors treatment did
not affect spheroid formation by Caco-2 or MCF-10A cells
when added either alone or in combination (Fig. S7).
Together these data suggest that the crosstalk
between the PI3K/Akt/FoxO and Src pathways via DGKα
provides cancer cells with a mechanism to adapt and
subvert the deleterious effects of PI3K/Akt inhibition.
DGKα targeting might therefore represent a useful and
non-explored approach to combine with and prevent
resistance to anti-cancer therapies aimed to inhibit the
PI3K/AKT axis.

Improvement of anticancer therapies requires
reliable identification of targets with a clear role in cancer
cell adaptation to the cues of the tumor microenvironment.
Three-dimensional cell culture constitutes a valuable tool
for target identification, since it resembles the conditions
that cells might encounter in vivo [61]. Compared to 2D,
3D-cultured cells show patent differences not only in
morphology, but also in the expression of various receptors
and oncogenes, and in the response to drugs [62]. Here we
identify DGKα upregulation as part of the reprogramming
that occurs when breast and colon cancer cells grow in
a 3D microenvironment. In addition, we demonstrate
that DGKα silencing or its pharmacological targeting
limits cell growth only when cells are 3D-cultured or
xenografted in immune-compromised mice, but not
during 2D cultures. Our data reinforce previous reports
supporting a positive function of DGKα in cancer, and
also provide a mechanistic link by showing that DGKα
contributes to Src activation. These findings identify
DGKα as a component of a positive feedback loop that
contributes to Src-regulated functions and as a potential
target for the development of anti-tumor therapies
Several reports indicate that DGKα sustains survival
of cancer cells, including lymphoma, melanoma and
hepatoma [2-4]. DGKα phosphorylation by Src correlates
with the activation of its lipid kinase activity [17, 18],
leading to PA generation. In this study we demonstrate
that DGKα, in addition to its previous identification as a
Src target, may also contribute to enhance Src functions.
The mechanisms that control Src hyperactivation in cancer
remain unclear [30] although it is becoming apparent
that oncogenic Src functions are largely dictated by
protein interactions that facilitate/restrict its activation.
These modulators include upstream RTK, kinases and
phosphatases that regulate Src conformation, as well
as substrates that unclamp closed/inactive Src and lead
to an open/active state [20, 63-65]. Additionally, Src
activity is conditioned by its spatial localization or
compartmentalization in distinct membrane microdomains
[66, 67]. The unique features of DGKα might allow it to
modulate Src at several levels, and thus contribute to its
oncogenic properties.
The correlation between DGKα expression and
Src autophosphorylation at Y419 correlates with the
well-established mechanism of Src activation as a
result of substrate interaction. Src modular structure
facilitates activation by its substrates through a sequential
mechanism: Src SH3 domain mediates the recognition of
targets that contain proline-rich sequences. Subsequent
phosphorylation leads to exposure of an additional Src
docking site, generally a SH2 binding motif, promoting
an open/active conformation of the kinase [21, 68]. DGKα
does not have a consensus SH3 interaction motif, but its
C-terminal region contains a proline stretch that interacts
9719

Oncotarget

with Src in vitro. This interaction drives subsequent
phosphorylation of DGKα at Y335 providing additional
anchorage to Src SH2 motif [18]. Our studies suggest that
DGKα, like FAK and CAS, might belong to the family
of Src substrates with capacity to promote Src activation.
The capacity of DGKα to trigger Src activation by
means of interaction would be independent of its function
as a PA producer. In agreement, we show that a kinase
inactive DGKα was still capable to bind Src and become
phosphorylated. Nonetheless, reconstitution experiments
strongly suggest that DGKα activity contributes to Src
activation. In this regard, recent studies have identified
motifs for binding of acid lipids, including PA, in the Src
unique and SH3 domains [69]. PA binding to Src would
thus represent an additional layer of regulation to modify
Src conformation and activity. In addition to PA mediated
Src regulation, others have shown that DGKα-generated
PA contributes to the survival and invasive properties
of cancer cells by several mechanisms. DGKα-derived
PA promotes mobilization and membrane tethering of
RCP, a modulator of Rab protein trafficking, which is
necessary for integrin recycling and cell migration in p53mutant background [7]. DGKα-PA production activates
phosphodiesterase activity, that controls cAMP levels
and the expression of cAMP responsive genes critical for
cancer cell survival including mTOR and HIF-1 [11].
Our results suggest a model in which DGKα
interaction with Src would allow mutual regulation of
both kinases in a complex, multilayered process that
would enhance PA production and Src activation. A
partial contribution of DGKα-catalytic activity may help
to explain the stronger effects on 3D growth observed
following treatment with a pharmacological inhibitor
when compared to those obtained after DGKα silencing.
Whereas both treatments decrease total DGK activity to
a similar extent, we demonstrate that R59949 treatment
also promotes disruption of the DGKα-Src complex, most
probably as a consequence of steric interference. A partial
DGKα depletion following genetic silencing (aprox. 60%
of total enzyme) would be less effective than the inhibitor
targeting complex formation.
This role for DGKα as a Src modulator helps to
understand the stronger addiction for this lipid kinase
of transformed cells when growing in 3D compared to
non-transformed, acini forming cells. This is likely the
consequence of the strict requirement that transformed
cells have for Src-mediated regulation of growth and
survival pathways in the context of matrix components.
It also explains the apparent lack of effect when cells are
grown in 2D cultures.
DGKα promotion of Src activation might also
explain the higher DGKα levels found in hepatic tumors
when compared to untransformed neighboring tissue
[4]. DGKα is increased in 20% of hepatomas, where it
is associated with high Ki67 levels and recurrence rate.
In these studies, the authors suggest that DGKα promotes
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

MEK/ERK activation by a Ras-independent mechanism.
It is tempting to suggest a function for DGKα promoting
Src signaling in this cancer type, since there is mounting
evidence of a role for Src in hepatocellular carcinoma
development [70].
Our studies define an important contribution
of DGKα to Src mediated functions. The increased
DGKα expression observed at distinct stages of cancer
progression, that is, from initial to metastatic growth
[13] correlates with the reported function of Src in
metastasis and suggests DGKα upregulation in response
to stress conditions, such as limited nutrient availability
or chemotherapy treatments. In this latter case, our
data demonstrate that DGKα expression, upregulated
in response to PI3K/Akt inhibition, contributes to Src
activation, and provide additional proof of DGKα as
part of tumor escape mechanisms. In summary, DGKα
upregulation in 3D context links the function of this
enzyme to tumor survival and drug resistance mechanisms,
and further supports development of new drug therapies
based on this lipid kinase.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and culture
MCF-10A, HEK293 and SW480 cells were
purchased from the ATCC. MDA-MB-468 was kindly
donated by Dr. L. Planelles (CNB/CSIC) and Caco-2
by Dr. A. González (CNB/CSIC). SW480 cells were
maintained in DMEM (Lonza) supplemented with 10%
FBS (GBio) and 2 mM L-Gln (Gibco). Caco-2 cells were
maintained with 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco). MCF10A cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 (Lonza, 1:1,
v/v), 5% horse serum (Gibco), 2 mM L-Gln, insulintransferrin-selenium (Gibco), 500 ng/ml hydrocortisone
(Calbiochem) and 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor
(EGF, Upstate). MDA-MB-468 cells were cultured in
Leibovitz’s medium (L15, Lonza). All cell lines were
maintained at 37ºC and 5% CO2 except MDA-MB-468,
which was cultured without CO2 in L15 medium. Identity
of the breast-derived cell lines was confirmed by STR
genotyping (Genomics Facility, IIB/CSIC, Madrid, Spain).

fluoride, 40mM β-glycerolphosphate and 1mM sodium
orthovanadate). Cell lysates were centrifuged (12000 x g,
15 min, 4ºC), and 20 µg of the resulting supernatant mixed
with lipid micelles containing the substrate. The reaction
was initiated by addition of reaction mix (1 mM ATP, 10
mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT and 10 µCi [γ-32P]
ATP) and incubated (10 min, 25ºC) in a final volume of
50 µl, and was terminated by addition of 1 N HCl. Lipids
were extracted after addition of CHCl3/MeOH (2:1 v/v).
The organic layer was recovered, dried and applied to
silica gel TLC plates, which were developed in a CHCl3/
MeOH/4 M NH4OH solvent system (9:7:2 v/v/v), dried,
and autoradiographed. A non-radioactive standard of the
reaction product was used to identify the lipid of interest.

DGK silencing
DGK-targeting was performed using the human
DGKα (nt 1153-1173) and DGKζ (nt 2290-2310)
validated sequences [35, 36, 71]. For transient silencing
the sequences were transfected as dsRNA (Ambion)
using oligofectamine (Invitrogen). A scramble dsRNA
was used as control (Ambion). Effective DGK depletion
was achieved at 72-96 h post-transfection. After 96h
the expression was recovered. For stable silencing,
64 pb double strand oligonucleotides, encompassing
the corresponding interfering 21 nt sequence and a
hairpin structure, were cloned in the pSuperRetro vector
(Oligoengine). As control the pSuperRetro construct
harboring the homolog specific DGKζ mouse sequence
was used. This control did not reduce the levels of human
DGKα or ζ. SW480 cells were infected using standard
protocols with the pSuperRetro-cloned sequencecontaining retroviruses. Cells with the retrovirus insertion
were selected by culturing in media with G418 (800 µg/
ml) until the control, non-infected cells died (∼1 week).
The pools were checked for DGK silencing, maintained in
media with G418 (500 µg/ml) and used in the long-term
experiments.

Cell Proliferation
The effect of the distinct drugs over cell proliferation
was determined by evaluating the cell viability using the
Promega Cell Titer cell proliferaton assay and according
to the manufacturer instructions. The cells were cultured in
96 well plates in either 2D or 3D conditions. Absorbance
was measured at 492 nm in a Sunrise Tecan instrument.

Expression vectors and transfection
Myc-DGKα cloned in pMT2 was a kind gift of Dr.
A. Graziani (University of Piamonte Orientale, Italy).
A kinase-dead version of the enzyme was generated,
Gly 434 to Ala, using the Quick-Change mutagenesis
kit. Oligonucleotides used were: DGKA-G434Aforw:
5´-TTGCTGTGTGGTGCAGACGGCACAGTA-3´,
DGKA-G434Arev:5´-TACTGTGCCGCTTGCACCACA
CACCAA-3´. Nucleotides underlined encoded for the
modified amino acid.
The plasmid encoding Src was generated by cloning
chicken Src into pCDNA3. Transfections were performed
with Lipofectamine LTX/Plus reagent (Invitrogen).

Cell drug treatments
The different inhibitors were added to plated cells
in complete media for the indicated time (24 to 48 h).
For DGK inhibition the DGK inhibitor II (R59949) was
used since this drug has been reported by our laboratory
and others to be much more potent and specific that DGK
inhibitor I [38, 47]. To avoid inactivation of R59949 by the
serum present in the culture medium and/or the long times
of treatment, inhibitor doses from 15 to 30 µM in DMSO
were used in the experiments.

Western blot
For lysates, cells were washed in cold PBS, and
scraped into ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Hepes pH 7.4,
150 mM NaCl, 1% TritonX-100, 10% glycerol) with
protease and phosphatase inhibitors (20 µM leupeptin, 1.5
µM aprotinin, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate,
40 mM β-glycerophosphate, 2  mM NaF). Clarified
lysates were quantified with the Pierce 660 nm Protein
Assay (Thermo Scientific), denatured in Laemmli buffer,
and resolved by PAGE. Proteins were transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) and incubated with
the indicated antibodies.
To prepare lysates from matrigel, cell cultures
were scraped into PBS with 5 mM EDTA, protease and

the substrate were prepared by sonication of the lipid in
the presence of PtdSer (10 min, room temperature (RT));
the final concentration of both lipids in the assay was 2
mM. Cells were lysed by sonication in Tris-HCl 50 mM
pH 7.5, with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (20µM

a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope.

Real time PCR

Immunoprecipitation

RNA was extracted from cell cultures using Trizol
reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized from cell
culture-extracted RNA (1 µg) after DNase (Invitrogen)
treatment and retrotranscription with Random Primers
(Applied Biosystems) and SuperScript II Reverse
Transcriptase (Invitrogen). qPCR reactions were
performed with the Power SYBR Green PCR Master
Mix (Applied Biosystems) in 10 µl final volume. PCR
conditions were as follows: 50ºC (10 min), 95ºC (2 min),
40 cycles at 95ºC (15 s) and 60ºC (1 min). Reactions
were run in triplicate with the Applied Biosystems
7900HT system. Relative expression of each gene was
calculated using the ∆∆Ct method. GAPDH was used
as control. Oligonucleotides used were: DGKAforw:
5´-CAATCACATCTGTGGGTGCGAGGA-3´,
DGKArev: 5´-TTCCCGCCACTCTTAGGATTGAC-3´;
GAPDHforw: 5´-ACAGCCTCAAGATCATCAGCAA-3´,
GAPDHrev: 5´-ATGGCATGGACTGTGGTCATG-3´.

For protein-protein interaction analysis, cells were
lysed (30 min, 4ºC) as above. Lysates (500 µg-1 mg) were
incubated (overnight, 4ºC) with appropriate antibody,
followed by 50 µl 50% protein  G-Sepharose slurry (1
h, 4ºC). Immunoprecipitates were washed thrice in lysis
buffer and once with 0.5 M LiCl. Immunoprecipitated
proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes for Western blot analysis.

3D cell culture
3D cell culture on matrigel was performed as
described [46]. Briefly, 300 µl matrigel was added
to each well of a 6-well chamber (10 cm2 surface) and
allowed to solidify (20 min, 37ºC). Cells were trypsinized,
resuspended in assay medium (normal medium with 2.5%
matrigel) and seeded (1.5 to 3 x 103 cells/cm2). Assay
medium was changed every 48 h, and cells allowed
to grow up to 14 days. For inhibitor treatment, cells
were allowed to grow for 4 days, and then treated for 2
additional days.

Xenograft model
All mouse work was carried out in accordance with
a protocol approved by the CNB/CSIC Ethics Committee
for Animal Experimentation (CEEA-CNB, no. 090004).
SW480-shRNA-control and -shRNA-DGKα cells (1.5
x 106) were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) into the flank
of female BALB/c SCID mice aged 6-8 weeks. Tumor
growth was monitored every two days and volume
estimated according to the formula: volume = (a2 x b)/2,
where a = tumor width and b = tumor length in mm. At
the end of the experiment (when control tumors reached
1 cm3, ~30 days), mice were sacrificed, tumors extracted
and weighed.
To assay the effect of the DGK inhibitor R59949
on in vivo tumor growth, SW480 parental cells (106)
were injected s.c. into the flank of female mice as
above. Pharmacological treatment was initiated when
tumors reached ≥150 mm3 (~15 days). R59949 was
administered s.c. (10 mg/kg) every 48 h for 10 days. The
tumor volume and weight of each mouse was recorded
along the treatment. Mice were sacrificed 48 h after
the last dose. Tumors were weighed and then fixed
overnight in paraformaldehyde, followed by dehydration
in graded ethanol, and embedded in paraffin for
immunohistochemical studies.

Colony formation assays
Cells (5 x 102/well) were seeded in 12-well plates
and allowed to grow for 10 days. Colonies and foci were
stained with 0.1% crystal violet solution in 20% methanol.
After extensive washing, crystal violet was dissolved in
10% acetic acid, and absorbance measured at 620 nm in a
Sunrise Tecan instrument.

Immunofluorescence
Cells were plated on matrigel-coated (60-70 µl)
8-well chambers (Ibidi) and after treatment as indicated,
were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (10 min, RT). Cells
were permeabilized with 0.5%  Triton X-100 (30 min),
blocked with 10% goat serum, 0.05% TritonX-100 in
TBS (30 min, 37ºC), and incubated with appropriate
primary antibody in incubation buffer (1% goat serum
in TBS; 3 h, 37ºC) in a humidified chamber. Secondary
antibodies (goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 or 594; both
from Invitrogen) were added and incubated (1 h, RT). To
assess proliferation, EdU (Click-iT EdU Cell Proliferation
Assays, Life Technologies) was used as recommended.
Finally, samples were incubated with DAPI (Invitrogen,
1:1000, 20 min, RT) and Alexa Fluor 488- or TRITCwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget
