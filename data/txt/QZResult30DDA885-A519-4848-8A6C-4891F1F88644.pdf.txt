BACKGROUND: Histologic response to preoperative chemotherapy is a strong prognostic factor for osteosarcoma
(OS). Thallium-201 (Tl-201) scintigraphic response to initial chemotherapy has previously been described as a predictor of histologic response. In the current study, the authors re-examined a series of patients studied using Tl-201 scintigraphy to determine the correlation between changes observed on Tl-201 scintigraphy and event-free survival
(EFS). METHODS: A total of 22 patients with biopsy-proven OS of the extremity underwent Tl-201 imaging before
and immediately after preoperative chemotherapy. The maximum pixel counts taken over the tumor divided by those
taken of a background region yielded a tumor-to-background ratio (TBR). The percentage of change in the TBR
before and after adjuvant chemotherapy, defined as the alteration ratio (AR), was correlated with EFS. RESULTS: The
median AR was 85% (range, 28-100%). The 3-year EFS was 0.72 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.48-0.86) and
the 5-year EFS was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.43-0.86). There was no association between AR and EFS detected in this cohort
(hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.95-1.02 [Somers rank correlation coefficient, 0.15]). CONCLUSIONS: Although Tl-201
scintigraphy was used as a tool for the assessment of response to chemotherapy in patients with OS, the AR did not
appear to be predictive of EFS in this small group of patients. It is necessary to use the outcome variables of ultimate
interest–EFS and overall survival– and not rely on surrogates for outcome to evaluate potential prognostic factors.

Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most commonly occurring primary malignant bone tumor in children, adolescents,
and young adults, with an incidence of approximately 600 cases each year in the United States.1 The successful treatment
of OS requires multiagent chemotherapy,2,3 as well as definitive surgical resection of the primary site of disease and any
clinically detectable sites of metastatic disease. Although combination chemotherapy has significantly improved outcomes
for patients with OS, risk-adapted therapy has not come of age because of a lack of adequately robust prognostic factors.
Currently, prognostic factors for patients with OS include site and size of the primary tumor, the presence of detectable
metastatic disease,4-6 adequacy of surgical resection, and degree of tumor necrosis after induction chemotherapy.7,8 A
Huvos grade III or IV response (90% necrosis) to induction chemotherapy is reported to be predictive of an improved
event-free survival (EFS).9,10 Tumor necrosis can be assessed only once and only after a relatively protracted period of
treatment. For this reason, noninvasive methods have been sought to serve as surrogate markers of this response. The hope
has been that these markers could predict EFS and potentially serve as early indicators of response to therapy, which could
allow for therapy modifications in poor responders without waiting for the completion of induction chemotherapy.
One of the early functional imaging modalities evaluated as a predictor of response to chemotherapy in patients with
OS was thallium-201 (Tl-201) scintigraphy. Tl-201 is a monovalent cationic radioisotope that has properties of a potassium analog.11 Although Tl-201 scintigraphy was initially used for myocardial perfusion imaging, in the 1970s its use in

tumor imaging was recognized.12 It has been suggested
that patients with OS who did not have a >80% reduction in Tl-201 uptake after preoperative chemotherapy be
considered candidates for aggressive surgical treatment.13
In the current study, we describe a follow-up to a
previously published report from our institution that
demonstrated an excellent correlation between changes on
Tl-201 scintigraphy and percentage of tumor necrosis after induction chemotherapy.14 We extended those observations by assessing the correlation between changes
observed on Tl-201 scintigraphy and EFS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
A retrospective chart review was conducted to extend the
follow-up of a series of patients previously described by
Imbriaco et al in 1997.14 This series included 22 consecutive patients (9 females and 13 males with a mean age of
14.3  5 years) with biopsy-proven, high-grade skeletal
OS diagnosed at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) between October 1993 and October 1996.
Initial staging evaluation included Tl-201 scintigraphy in
all patients. All patients received induction chemotherapy
before undergoing surgical resection. The majority of
patients received chemotherapy on or according to the
Children’s Cancer Group CCG7921 protocol with cisplatin, doxorubicin, and high-dose methotrexate. One
patient was treated on the MSKCC T12 protocol with
high-dose methotrexate, vincristine, doxorubicin, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and bleomycin and 1 patient was
treated with ifosfamide, doxorubicin, and high-dose
methotrexate. After the completion of preoperative chemotherapy and before definitive tumor resection, Tl-201
imaging was repeated. No additional chemotherapy was
given between the second Tl-201 imaging and surgical
resection. The initial histologic diagnosis was confirmed
after surgical resection. Tumor response to chemotherapy
was graded according to the criteria of Huvos et al.15 The
institutional review board at MSKCC approved the
review of medical records for this analysis.
Thallium-201 Scintigraphy
The acquisition of images and determination of an alteration ratio (AR) in each patient were described previously.14 Briefly, the maximum pixel counts taken over the
tumor divided by the maximum pixel counts taken over a
background region yielded a tumor-to-background ratio
(TBR). The TBR obtained before chemotherapy was

4148

compared with the TBR obtained after chemotherapy,
and the percentage change in the TBR was defined as
the AR.
Statistical Analysis
The goal of this follow-up study was to determine the
association between a Tl-201 scintigraphy-generated AR
and EFS. EFS was calculated from the date of surgical
resection to date of death, disease recurrence, or last follow-up. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate
the EFS function. The Somers rank correlation coefficient
was estimated, taking into account that EFS was subject
to censoring.16 A univariate Cox regression model was
used to examine the association between AR and EFS.
Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%
CIs) were reported. All statistical analyses were conducted
using SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) and R 2.9.2
(SAS Institute Inc) statistical software.

RESULTS
All patients completed pre- and postchemotherapy
Tl-201 scans, induction chemotherapy, and surgical resection of the tumor. Patient characteristics, scintigraphic
results, and histologic response to chemotherapy are presented in Table 1. In the prior article, the correlation
between AR and necrosis was described for 24 patients.14
Review of patient records for the current analysis revealed
that 2 of the subjects in the previous analysis did not have
OS. Therefore, we excluded them and used only the 22
patients with confirmed OS for the current analysis.
The median AR was 85% (range, 28-100%). Three
patients had tumors with a Huvos grade I response to
chemotherapy, 3 had a grade II response, 9 had a grade III
response, and 7 had a grade IV response. The initial publication generated from this series of patients described a
strong positive correlation (correlation coefficient, 0.93;
standard error, 10.2% [P < .001]) between the AR and
the percentage of tumor necrosis at the time of definitive
surgical resection.14
All patients resumed chemotherapy postoperatively
on or according to their original chemotherapy protocols.
No changes were made to chemotherapy regimens based
on histologic response to initial chemotherapy. Three
patients did not complete planned adjuvant chemotherapy: 2 patients died of disease after the first cycle of postoperative chemotherapy and 1 patient who developed
disease progression at a site of metastatic disease after 2
cycles of postoperative chemotherapy was switched from

Six of the 22 patients experienced disease recurrence
(3 patients in the lungs, 1 patient in bone, and 2 patients
in both the lungs and bone). All patients with recurrent
disease had died by the time of last follow-up, although 1
of these patients died of sepsis while in complete response
(CR) after the successful treatment of disease recurrence.
One patient with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis never achieved a CR and died of disease 5 months after
diagnosis. The remaining 15 patients were alive without
evidence of disease at the time of last follow-up. The median follow-up time for survivors without disease progression was 145 months (range, 28-174 months). The 3-year
EFS for all patients was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.48-0.86) and the
5-year EFS was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.43-0.86). There was no

coefficient, 0.15]). When the 4 patients with metastatic
disease were excluded, the 3-year EFS was 0.83 (95% CI,
0.5-0.94). Figure 1 describes EFS in all patients and in the
patients with localized disease whose Tl-201 scintigraphic
response to chemotherapy yielded an AR greater than or
equal to the median AR of 85% and those whose response
yielded a value less than the median AR of 85%. Because
of the small number of events (n ¼ 3) in the patient group
with localized disease, the association between AR and
EFS could not be tested using univariate analysis.

DISCUSSION
It is well established that histologic response to preoperative chemotherapy is correlated with EFS in patients with
OS.7-9,17 A previous report from our institution identified
the percentage change in uptake of T1-201 before and
after preoperative chemotherapy as being strongly correlated with the percentage of tumor necrosis documented
at the time of tumor resection.14 Multiple other groups
similarly reported thallium imaging as an indicator of

4149

response to the preoperative treatment of OS.18-23 Small
studies have suggested that T1-201 scintigraphy correlates
more significantly with histologic response to treatment
than either digital subtraction angiography19 or technetium-99m methylene-diphosphonate (MDP) bone scintigraphy.22 It is therefore tempting to extrapolate Tl-201
scintigraphic response as a predictor of outcome in
patients with OS. The current study expands on our previous institutional report to assess the association between
Tl-201 AR and EFS.
In contrast to the positive correlation demonstrated
between AR and histologic response to preoperative
chemotherapy, no association was demonstrated between
AR and EFS. This study population is representative of
the general OS population. Four of the 22 patients had
metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, the majority of
cases involved the distal femur or proximal tibia, and we
observed a 5-year EFS rate of 67%. Because the series of
patients was diagnosed and initially treated >13 years
ago, the results are unlikely to change with further followup. However, the current study is limited by the small
sample size and its retrospective nature. Given the limited
number of events, a correlation between AR and EFS
could exist, and we cannot rule out the possibility of a
false-negative result. In addition, patients with both localized and metastatic disease were included in the analysis of
an association between AR and EFS. When patients with
localized disease were examined independently, the analysis was further limited by the small number of events in
this group, and no reliable conclusions could be drawn. If
Tl-201 scintigraphy had not been replaced by dynamic
enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and [F-18]fluorodeoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography
(18FDG-PET) as the imaging modalities of interest for
the assessment of early response to chemotherapy, confirmation of the lack of an association between AR and EFS
in a larger prospective study would be required.
Several groups have reported on the use of dynamic
enhanced MRI24;25 and 18FDG-PET26-28 to evaluate
response to induction chemotherapy in patients with OS.
To the best of our knowledge, the majority of reports published to date have compared the results of noninvasive
imaging with the degree of necrosis after initial chemotherapy. A correlation between imaging and necrosis cannot be equated with a correlation between imaging and
survival. Each surrogate marker must be validated independently as in the work of Hawkins et al.28 In 2002,
Hawkins et al reported that both the standard uptake
value (SUV) after induction chemotherapy and the

4150

change in SUV with induction chemotherapy were correlated with the histopathologic assessment of response in
pediatric patients with OS and the Ewing sarcoma family
of tumors.28 They recently expanded on this series of
patients and published their experience with 18FDG-PET
as a predictor of outcome in patients with extremity OS.
They reported an association between an SUV <2.5 after
induction chemotherapy and improved progression-free
survival, which did not achieve a conventional level of significance for patients with localized disease, and they suggested a larger prospective study before establishing
18
FDG-PET response as a prognostic factor for patients
with OS.29
Tl-201 scintigraphy is no longer an imaging tool
that is used commonly in the monitoring of patients with
OS; however, the conclusions drawn from its use in this
group of patients highlight the caution that should be
taken in assessing prognostic factors. Although functional
imaging modalities are being evaluated as early indicators
of response in many cancers, it is critical to use the outcome variables of ultimate interest–EFS and overall survival– and not settle for surrogates for outcome.
