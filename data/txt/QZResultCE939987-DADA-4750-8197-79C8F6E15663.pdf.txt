Abstract
Changes in gene dosage are a major driver of cancer, engineered from a finite, but increasingly
well annotated, repertoire of mutational mechanisms1. This can potentially generate correlated
copy number alterations across hundreds of linked genes, as exemplified by the 2% of childhood
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with recurrent amplification of megabase regions of
chromosome 21 (iAMP21)2,3. We used genomic, cytogenetic and transcriptional analysis, coupled
with novel bioinformatic approaches, to reconstruct the evolution of iAMP21 ALL. We find that
individuals born with the rare constitutional Robertsonian translocation between chromosomes 15
and 21, rob(15;21)(q10;q10)c, have ~2700-fold increased risk of developing iAMP21 ALL
compared to the general population. In such cases, amplification is initiated by a chromothripsis
event involving both sister chromatids of the Robertsonian chromosome, a novel mechanism for
cancer predisposition. In sporadic iAMP21, breakage-fusion-bridge cycles are typically the
initiating event, often followed by chromothripsis. In both sporadic and rob(15;21)c-associated
iAMP21, the final stages frequently involve duplications of the entire abnormal chromosome. The
end-product is a derivative of chromosome 21 or the rob(15;21)c chromosome with gene dosage
optimised for leukemic potential, showing constrained copy number levels over multiple linked
genes. Thus, dicentric chromosomes may be an important precipitant of chromothripsis, as we
show rob(15;21)c to be constitutionally dicentric and breakage-fusion-bridge cycles generate
dicentric chromosomes somatically. Furthermore, our data illustrate that several cancer-specific
mutational processes, applied sequentially, can co-ordinate to fashion copy number profiles over
large genomic scales, incrementally refining the fitness benefits of aggregated gene dosage
changes.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer, with an annual
incidence of 35/million children aged 0-14 years4. Approximately 2% of these cases show
intrachromosomal amplification of one copy of chromosome 21, iAMP21, which defines a
distinct ALL subgroup3,5 with prognostic and therapeutic implications6,7.
In 95 patients with iAMP21 ALL enrolled in UK clinical trials, we found 3 (3.2%) with a
constitutional Robertsonian translocation between chromosomes 15 and 21, rob(15;21)
(q10;q10)c. In other ALL trials, we identified a further nine cases of iAMP21 associated
with rob(15;21)c, at a similar fraction of cases. Robertsonian translocations are
rearrangements between the short arms of acrocentric chromosomes (namely, 13-15, 21-22).
They are found in ~1 in 1,000 newborns8,9, but rob(15;21)c accounts for only 0.5-1% of
these. To confirm this, we interrogated cytogenetics databases. Only three patients among
93,000 referrals for haematological malignancies to the Munich Leukemia Laboratory and
West Midlands Regional Genetics Laboratory carried rob(15;21)c. Similarly, only 16 cases
were found among approximately 300,000 referrals to UK regional cytogenetics laboratories
for investigation of infertility or previous Down syndrome birth.
From these data, we estimate the risk of iAMP21 ALL in carriers of rob(15;21)c to be
~2700–fold increased over the general population (Supplementary table 1). This association
is remarkably specific. All patients in this study with rob(15;21)c had iAMP21 ALL,
implying that they are not predisposed to other forms of ALL, nor other cancers, as far as we
can ascertain. Furthermore, the only Robertsonian translocation associated with iAMP21

ALL was rob(15;21)c. For clarity, we use ‘rob(15;21)c’ to denote the germline configuration
and ‘der(15;21)’ to describe the rearranged and amplified chromosome in these cases.

Using cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and copy number profiling, we
studied 21 patients with sporadic iAMP21 ALL and 12 patients with ALL associated with
rob(15;21)c. Five sporadic iAMP21 and four cases associated with rob(15;21)c were
sequenced to identify genomic rearrangements10 (Supplementary table 2; Extended data
figure 1; Supplementary figure 1). We applied deductive approaches, supported by
confirmatory simulations, to reconstruct principles underlying the temporal evolution of
iAMP21 ALL. This reasoning is explored in considerable detail, together with a sample-bysample analysis, in Supplementary results, Extended data figures 3-8, Supplementary tables
3-6 and Supplementary figures 4-23.
The broad themes are illustrated by two representative cases (Figures 1-2). In PD9020a, a
patient with sporadic iAMP21, the boundaries of the amplified region are demarcated by
fold-back inversion rearrangements (Figure 1A). These indicate breakage-fusion-bridge
(BFB) repair11, previously proposed to trigger iAMP212,12,13. Breakage-fusion-bridge repair
is a mutational process initiated by a telomeric double strand (ds) DNA break that is
replicated in S phase. In G2, the two copies of the dsDNA break are fused by nonhomologous end-joining (marked ① in figure 1A). This creates a dicentric chromosome in
which the two centromeres are pulled to opposite poles during mitosis, forming an anaphase
bridge. With cytokinesis, the bridge breaks, and the process can repeat in the next cell cycle
(marked ② in figure 1A). In the region between the fold-back inversions in PD9020a, we
also found a cluster of back-and-forth rearrangements (marked ③) of all four possible
orientations, associated with copy number profiles that oscillate among three states (Figure
1A, zoomed-in panel). These clusters bear the hallmarks of chromothripsis14 (Extended data
table 1; Extended data figure 2; Supplementary results), a mutational process in which a
one-off catastrophic event shatters one or a few chromosomal regions leading to large
numbers of localized genomic rearrangements15,16.

Two features of this genomic architecture allow reconstruction of the temporal evolution of
the iAMP21 chromosome. First, the rearrangements frequently link together genomic
segments of different copy number (off-diagonal histograms, Figure 1B). Secondly, as we
traverse chromosome 21 from first to last base-pair, the copy number segments on either
side of each breakpoint position typically differ in copy number by one (Figure 1C). FISH
confirms widespread RUNX1 signals along the iAMP21 chromosome (Figure 1D). Based on
reasoning outlined in detail in Supplementary results, these features indicate that
chromothripsis occurred after two BFB cycles and was likely the final major event,
stabilising the chromosome (Figure 1E).
In PD7170a, a der(15;21) iAMP21 derived from rob(15;21)c, the picture is dominated by a
series of back-and-forth rearrangements spanning chromosomes 15 and 21 (Figure 2A-C).
Cytogenetic and FISH studies confirmed that it was the Robertsonian chromosome
undergoing rearrangement (Figure 2D-E). A sizable number of rearrangements link together
segments of different copy number (off-diagonal histograms, Figure 2B), and copy number
oscillates among three, rather than two, states. Together with occasional inverted
rearrangements with no breakpoints between the two joined ends, this pattern argues that
chromothripsis was the initiating event, and that the chromothripsis process involved both
sister chromatids of the Robertsonian chromosome (Extended data figures 7-8;
supplementary results; supplementary table 4). Importantly, the shattered sister chromatids
are repaired into one derivative chromosome, thereby amplifying the copy number of some
chromosomal regions (Figure 2F). The amplification was completed by whole chromosome
duplication of the der(15;21) chromosome through isochromosome formation (Figure 2D).

These broad temporal sequences of events are reflected in the other samples (Figure 3;
Extended data figure 6; Supplementary results). In the other four sequenced cases of
sporadic iAMP21, a telomeric fold-back inversion suggests at least one BFB cycle. In each,
this was a critical early event, defining the break between the most amplified region of
chromosome 21 and subtelomeric loss. Chromothripsis occurred after the BFB cycles in
three cases. Finally, partial or whole chromosome duplications usually completed the
evolution. In the other three sequenced der(15;21) iAMP21 cases, amplification was
initiated by chromothripsis involving both sister chromatids of the rob(15;21)c chromosome.
This appeared to be followed by further rearrangements in two cases and was completed by
whole chromosome duplications.
These data provide insight into why there is such specific enrichment of iAMP21 ALL in
carriers of rob(15;21)c. Universally, the amplification is initiated by chromothripsis that
affects both sister chromatids of the Robertsonian chromosome. This suggests that
rob(15;21)c has a structural abnormality that specifically predisposes it, after replication, to
the catastrophic shattering of chromothripsis. Using FISH, we demonstrated that the
rob(15;21)c chromosome has centromeres from both chromosomes 15 and 21, and is thus
dicentric (Figure 2E, Extended data figure 1). Our hypothesis, therefore, is that the two
centromeres of the Robertsonian chromosome can occasionally confound attachment of
mitotic spindles to the sister kinetochores, such that each chromatid connects to spindles
emanating from opposite poles (Figure 2F). During anaphase, this merotelic attachment
would lead to lagging of both sister chromatids, rendering them jointly prone to
chromothripsis. The der(15;21) iAMP21 chromosomes consistently lose the chromosome 15
centromere, shown by FISH (Figure 2E) and sequencing (Figures 2A, 3B), potentially
enhancing stability of the derivative chromosome. In sporadic iAMP21 cases,
chromothripsis frequently follows BFB cycles. While we cannot know whether
chromothripsis is an immediate consequence, it is plausible that the dicentric chromosome
created by BFB repair could trigger chromothripsis, analogous to that seen with the dicentric
rob(15;21)c17,18.

The preceding analysis provides insight into the mutational processes shaping chromosome
21, but unless the resulting chromosome profile confers a selective advantage on the clone,
it will not expand. We combined copy number profiles and gene expression data3 from
additional patients with iAMP21 ALL (Figure 4). A consensus copy number profile emerged
in which regions from ~35.9-36.4Mb and ~38.0-40.0Mb of chromosome 21 were
consistently the most highly amplified and over-expressed, including genes important in
haematological malignancies such as RUNX1, DYRK1A and ETS22.
The final stage of iAMP21 generation usually involves duplication of the whole derivative
chromosome, through whole chromosome duplication, isochromosome or ring formation.
All duplications occurred after chromothripsis, suggesting that chromothripsis might be
remodeling chromosome 21 in a non-random fashion. We used the inferred temporal
evolution of somatic rearrangements to extract and average copy number changes resulting
from chromothripsis (Figure 4). As expected, chromothripsis spared the most amplified
regions, whereas on average 1-2 copies were deleted from other parts of the chromosome.
Analysis of der(15;21) iAMP21 suggested that regions of chromosome 15 were also
consistently lost or retained, although sample numbers are small (Extended data figure 9).
Strikingly, the consensus chromothripsis landscape in iAMP21 closely mirrored the copy
number profile of chromosome 21 averaged over thousands of cancer samples across
different cancer types19,20 (p=0.0003; Figure 4C; Supplementary figures 27-30). This
suggests that chromothripsis plays a critical role in optimising the copy number landscape of

chromosome 21 to maximise the net selective advantage gained from subsequent rounds of
whole chromosome duplication.

From a detailed dissection of the mutational forces causing one particular subtype of one
particular cancer, findings with general significance have emerged. Carriers of constitutional
rob(15;21)c chromosomes are specifically but massively predisposed to iAMP21 ALL.
Usually, constitutional risk of cancer is mediated by variation in coding sequence or gene
regulation, but here it appears to be transmitted through a propensity for the Robertsonian
chromosome to undergo chromothripsis after replication. This may be because it is dicentric
and prone to anaphase bridging, which would dovetail with the frequent occurrence of
chromothripsis following BFB cycles in sporadic iAMP21 ALL. This hypothesis is
consistent with the finding that lagging chromosomes during anaphase can become
sequestered in micronuclei and subjected to chromosomal pulverisation before rejoining the
main nucleus17,18. More generally, the study of iAMP21 ALL has illustrated how largescale copy number changes can be optimised by spatially and temporally coordinated
genomic instability taking several complementary forms. BFB cycles can generate rapidfire, focal amplification; chromothripsis causes loss of multiple, non-contiguous
chromosomal regions; and whole chromosome duplication gives expansive, low-amplitude
amplification. Their combined activity, therefore, gives considerably more flexibility to
shaping large-scale chromosomal copy number profiles than any one process alone. Of
course, clones sample these mutational processes randomly, so only when the aggregate
fitness of such changes is positive will the clone have the selective advantage to expand.

METHODS SUMMARY
Information was available from 21 iAMP21 patients and 12 with iAMP21 and rob(15;21)
(q10;q10)c (Supplementary Table 2). Paired-end sequencing data were generated as 37-75bp
paired reads from 400-500bp fragments as previously described10. The deductive reasoning
for reconstructing temporal evolution of complex rearrangements followed principles
formulated previously21. Confirmatory PCR across the breakpoints was performed for the
vast majority of identified rearrangements (Supplementary results).
