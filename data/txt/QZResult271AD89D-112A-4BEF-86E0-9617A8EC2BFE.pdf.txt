Abstract
Current users of postmenopausal hormones (PMH) have f30%
to 40% lower risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), although
associations with specific types of hormones have been
inconsistent. Further, it is not clear whether some tumor types
have a different risk. We conducted a case-control study to
examine the relationship between PMH and CRC. Cases
(n = 1,004), ages 50 to 74 years, were identified from the
Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results registry in Washington from 1998 to 2002; controls (n = 1,062) were randomly
selected from population lists. Case tissue samples were obtained
for microsatellite instability (MSI) analyses. Interviews collected
risk-factor data for CRC, including detailed information on PMH.
Multivariable logistic regression models estimated odds ratios
(OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Current use of any
PMH was associated with a 20% reduction in CRC risk (95% CI
0.6–0.9). This reduction in risk was limited to women who had
taken estrogen plus progestin (EP) preparations only (OR = 0.6,
95% CI 0.5–0.9); there was no association with estrogen-only
(E alone) use (OR = 0.9, 95% CI 0.7–1.1). For women with MSI-low
or MSI-stable tumors, there was a statistically significant 40%
reduction in CRC risk associated with EP use (95% CI 0.4–0.9);
there was no clear association with MSI-high tumors. EP use was
associated with a decreased risk of CRC; however, there seemed
to be no association with E alone data that are consistent with
the recent Women’s Health Initiative findings. Progestin may
enhance the estrogenic effect of conjugated estrogen so the
combination may be more biologically active in the colon than
E alone. [Cancer Res 2007;67(15):7534–9]

Introduction
Observational evidence regarding the association between
exogenous hormones and colorectal cancer (CRC) in women has
been remarkably consistent. In a metaanalysis, Grodstein et al.
reported a statistically significant inverse relative risk of 0.66 for
current users of postmenopausal hormones (PMH) compared with
nonusers (1). We observed over 10 years ago that it seemed the two
types of treatments [unopposed estrogen and estrogen plus
progestin (EP)] yielded similar inverse effects, suggesting that
estrogen was the active agent (2). A similar reduction was observed

in studies of PMH and colorectal adenomas (3–8). Nonetheless,
some have questioned whether PMH users simply represented a
population that was healthier than women not using PMH (9, 10)
and that the inverse association was, instead, due to the attributes
of the users rather than the preparations themselves (9, 11). Any
doubts about bias, however, were resolved by the recent results of
the randomized controlled trial in the Women’s Health Initiative
(WHI) which found that PMH was indeed associated with a
reduction in CRC risk (12). In these two studies, an important
difference in effect was observed according to preparation: there
was a 40% reduction in risk associated with EP use, whereas
estrogen only (E alone) was not related to incidence (13). However,
small numbers of CRC cases limited the interpretation.
Thus, in aggregate, epidemiologic evidence supports a protective
relationship of PMH in the colorectum, yet there are many
outstanding issues. Perhaps foremost is the question raised by WHI
regarding the role of progestin in the colon and rectum. Further
questions remain regarding specific patterns of use and subgroups,
including user characteristics and tumor types, such as microsatellite unstable lesions, that may be more strongly associated
with PMH use (14). We conducted a population-based case-control
study to specifically evaluate the relationship between PMH type
and CRC incidence.

Materials and Methods
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in accordance with assurances filed
with and approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Eligible case patients
included all female residents, ages 50 to 74 years, residing in the 13 counties
reporting to the Cancer Surveillance System [a population-based registry
that is part of the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology,
and End Results (SEER) program], who were newly diagnosed with invasive
colorectal adenocarcinoma (International Classification of Diseases for
Oncology codes C18.0, C18.2-.9, C19.9, C20.0-.9; ref. 15) between October
1998 and February 2002. Eligibility for all individuals was limited to those
who were English-speaking with available telephone numbers, in which they
could be contacted. On average, cases were identified within 4 months of
diagnosis.
After cases were identified, physicians were contacted about their
patients’ eligibility for this study. If the physicians approved, the individual
was approached with an introductory letter and then by a telephone call. Of
the 1,414 eligible case patients identified, 141 (10%) were deceased, 66 (4%)
were refused by physicians to contact, 22 (2%) could not be located, and
155 (11%) declined to participate, resulting in a final sample size of 1,030
case patients and an overall response proportion of 73%.
Community-based controls were randomly selected according to age
distribution (in 5-year age intervals) of the eligible cases by using lists of
licensed drivers from the Washington State Department of Licensing for
individuals, ages 50 to 64 years, and rosters from the Health Care Financing

Administration (now the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid) for
individuals older than 64 years. Of the 1,617 potential control subjects
identified, 44 (3%) were deceased, 46 (3%) could not be located, and 453
(28%) declined to participate. The final study sample included 1,074 control
subjects (overall response of 66%).
We used a structured 60-min telephone interview to obtain information
from all study participants on known or suspected risk factors for CRC,

including use of PMH 2 years before the interview date for cases and
controls. Women were asked about their use of estrogen and/or progestin,
the date of use it was started, the date of use it was stopped, and total
duration of use. The interview also elicited other medication use,
reproductive experiences, physical activity, smoking history, selected dietary
elements, height and weight, and medical history, including use of
screening, family history of cancer, and demographic factors.
SEER registry reports were used to obtain information on cancer
characteristics, including site, stage (local, regional, distant), and histology,
along with additional demographic information. Histologic confirmation
was reported for 97% of cases. For consenting cases, we collected pathology
reports for a standardized review of cancer diagnoses, including site, stage,
histology, grade, and distant spread.
Pathology materials. Paraffin-embedded colorectal tumors and diagnostic pathology reports were requested from a sequential sample of 757
CRC cases. Consent to acquire this material was obtained from 95% of
cases, and treating institutions provided specimens for 90% of these
consenting cases (n = 648). In general, sections were cut from the most
representative tumor block and normal tissue block and stained with H&E.
Stained sections were reviewed by site pathologist(s) and a colorectal tumor
block consisting of 70% to 80% tumor cells, and a block of normal tissue
were selected for further sectioning. For microsatellite instability (MSI)
testing (and other future tumor DNA-based studies), ten 5-Ag tumor
sections were prepared. DNA was extracted from tumor and normal tissue
using tissue DNA extraction kits from QIAGEN, Inc.
MSI analysis. MSI testing was completed on 590 tumors (9% had
insufficient tissue for analysis) using nine markers: four mononucleotide
markers (BAT25, BAT26, BAT40, and BAT34C4), four dinucleotide repeats
(ACTC, D5S346, D18S55, and D10197), and one complex marker (MYCL).
These markers include the five recommended markers in the panel
proposed during the National Cancer Institute workshop on MSI for cancer
detection (16). PCR fragments were tagged with a fluorescent dye and
analyzed on an ABI3100 generic analyzer using a previously described
protocol (17). For all of the cases, we corroborated the MSI results with IHC
testing for hMLH1, hMSH2, and hMSH6. In a round-robin reading, this
approach and interpretation has been highly reproducible.
Definitions and statistical analysis. PMH use was defined as any use for
6 months or more, and then was further divided, if possible, by type of
preparation. Women were classified as E alone users if they had used
estrogen exclusively for 6 months or more and had never used progestin, and
as EP users if they had taken a combined preparation exclusively for
6 months or more. Women who had used both an E alone regimen and an EP
regimen were included as a separate category, because the interpretation of

the exposure was unclear. Current use of PMH was defined as use of
hormones f2 years before the interview date to ascertain patterns of use
before diagnosis (reference date). Duration of PMH use was defined as the
cumulative duration of all periods of use. Women were considered nonusers
if they had never used PMH or had used PMH for <6 months. Tumors
were classified as MSI-stable (MSS, 0% of loci unstable), MSI-low (>0% to
<30% of loci unstable), or MSI-high (z30% of loci unstable); unequivocal
results for at least five markers were required to classify a tumor’s MSI status.
Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the
association between PMH use and CRC incidence were estimated using
logistic regression models, adjusting for age (in 5-year intervals), body mass
index (BMI, kg/m2 in quartiles), adult onset diabetes (present, absent, or
unknown), smoking status (never, former, current), regular NSAID use of
3 months or more (yes, no), colorectal screening sigmoidoscopy history
within the past 10 years (yes, no, unknown), physical activity (in quartiles
of hours per week), and family history of CRC (present, absent, unknown).
These covariates were chosen based on a priori knowledge about risk factors
for CRC. Tests of trend were conducted by including the variable in the
model as an ordinal variable. To evaluate whether there were differences in
the OR for E alone use versus EP use, we tested the significance of the OR for
the contrast between E alone and EP using a three-level categorical covariate
(never user, E alone, and EP) in the logistic model. Covariates, such as age at
diagnosis, BMI, and tumor characteristics, were selected as effect modifiers
because they may also influence hormone levels. Tests for interactions were
assessed by a change in the log-likelihood ratio after the addition of a crossproduct term between the exposure and effect modifier. Hormone use was
unknown for 26 cases and 12 controls; after these exclusions, 1,004 cases and
1,062 controls remained for analysis. All statistical analyses were done using
SAS v8.2 (SAS Institute, Inc.); all statistical significance tests were two-sided.

suggestion of a slightly increased risk associated with former use
of E alone (OR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.0–2.2). For women who used EP, there
was no association between former use and CRC; however, current
users had a 40% reduction in risk (95% CI 0.5–0.9), although this
association seemed to be only present among women who used EP
for 5 years or more. There was a statistically significant difference in
the risk estimates for women who took E alone preparations and
women who took EP (P = 0.01). When examining time since last use

Results
The mean age was 64.2 years (range, 50–74 years) for cases and
64.5 years (range, 50–74 years) for controls. Age-adjusted selected
characteristics of cases and controls are presented in Table 1. Cases
were more likely than controls to have higher BMIs (mean BMIs,
28.1 kg/m2 versus 26.7 kg/m2), adult onset diabetes, ever smoked,
and to have had a family history of CRC. Among cases, MSI-high
status was observed in 23.7% of tumors.
For all types of PMH use, there was a statistically significant
reduction in CRC risk only among current users of PMH (OR = 0.8,
95% CI 0.6–0.9), particularly among those who had used PMH for
5 years or more (Table 2). When stratified by type of preparation,
the analysis showed no clear associations between E alone use and
CRC risk regardless of recency or duration. There was even a

(Table 3), there were again no apparent trends between time since
last E alone or EP use and CRC risk.
Associations between PMH use and CRC risk stratified by other
modifiers of hormone levels are presented in Table 4. Women, ages
70 to 74 years, had a 40% reduction in CRC risk with both E alone
and EP use. For slightly younger women (60–69 years), a reduction
in risk was seen with EP use but not with E alone use. For the
youngest women (50–59 years), there was no reduction in risk with
any type of use; indeed, there was evidence of increased risk (OR =
1.8, 95% CI 1.1–3.0) associated with use of E alone. There were no
patterns in the associations between use of either type of PMH
preparation and each of the following: BMI, family history, and
history of distal colon screening sigmoidoscopy. Associations
between CRC risk and PMH in the presence or absence of a uterus
were also examined: among women with an intact uterus, there
was a 30% reduction in risk in women who used EP compared with
nonusers. For those without a uterus, there was no statistically
significant reduction in risk (data not shown).
Associations between PMH use and CRC risk stratified by tumor
characteristics are presented in Table 5. There were no associations
between MSI-high tumors and use of PMH, regardless of preparation, but for MSI-low or MSS tumors, there was a 20% (95% CI
0.6–1.0) reduction in risk associated with any PMH use and a 40%
(95% CI 0.4–0.9) reduction in risk associated with EP use. These
effects were, however, not statistically significantly different by MSI
status (P = 0.34 for EP). Use of EP was also associated with a 40%
(95% CI 0.4–1.0) reduction in tumors with a localized stage at
diagnosis. For tumors diagnosed at a distant stage, any PMH use,
E alone and EP, were associated with a statistically significant 40%
to 50% reduction in risk. In a stratified analysis, there were no
associations between E alone use and any tumor subsite. However,
EP use was consistently associated with a 30% to 40% reduction in
risk, regardless of tumor site.

Discussion
A differential effect of PMH was observed in this study: EP use
was associated with a statistically significant inverse risk, but

www.aacrjournals.org

E alone use was not associated with CRC. Neither MSI status nor
stage at diagnosis seemed to modify the associations between PMH
use and CRC risk. Our confidence in these finding is enhanced by
the large size of the case and control groups, the population-based
nature of ascertainment, and the standardized evaluation of
hormone use and other CRC risk factors. Our MSI results were
further confirmed with immunohistochemistry testing, which
examined expression for the most commonly known mismatch
repair genes (hMLH1, hMSH2, hMSH6, hPMS2; ref. 18).
These results support previous studies of PMH and CRC by
extending the sample size, preparation specific analyses, and
molecular characterization of colorectal tumors. Observational
evidence regarding the association between exogenous hormones
and CRC in women has been remarkably consistent. Recent, pooled
metaanalyses have found a consistently inverse relationship
(20–40%) between PMH use and CRC risk (1, 19–21). Concerns
about bias in this relationship, however, persisted until the results of
the randomized controlled WHI estrogen-progestin study
(12). After an average 5.2 years of follow-up, there were 45 cases
of CRC in the combined EP group and 67 in the placebo arm (hazard
ratio 0.63, 95% CI 0.43–0.92). In the more recently terminated
E alone arm (13), the hazard ratio for CRC was 1.08; this result was
based on 62 cases in the estrogen arm and there was variation by
age (P = 0.048). There are important differences in the profiles of
women in the two treatment arms that may have affected the
results. Specifically, the E alone study enrolled slightly older women
who did not have a uterus.
Evidence from WHI suggests that there may be some effect
modification by age in the relationship between EP use and CRC
risk; although the interaction was not statistically significant, the
risk of CRC in women with ages 70 to 79 years was 0.51 compared
with 0.79 in women with ages 50 to 59 years (22). We too found that
the effect of EP was stronger in older women. Despite the
compelling evidence from WHI, there are, nonetheless, several
questions that will not be answered by that largest ever randomized
controlled trial of PMH preparations. For example, because that
study was stopped early, the effect of long-term use will not be

known; data for whether the inverse association would be stronger
among long-term users and whether it is independent of the
reduction associated with recent use will not be available. It is also
not known whether alternative regimens confer similar reductions
in risk of CRC. To our knowledge, the only other study that has
examined PMH use in relation to MSI colorectal tumors found that
recent users of hormones had a reduced risk of MSI-high tumors,
which we did not find in the present study; that study, however, used
a different set of markers for determining MSI status (14).
The major risk factors for large bowel cancer—obesity, physical
activity, and smoking—do seem to differ by sex; indeed, there is
substantial evidence that these factors have a hormonal basis
(23, 24). McMichael and Potter first suggested a role for estrogens
and progestins in preventing colon cancer (25). Although the
mechanism proposed at that time was based on changes in bile
acid metabolism synthesis, the biological actions of hormones are
myriad and are regulated by, among other things, their circulating
concentrations, the conversion to more active or less active
derivatives, and relevant receptor concentrations in the target
tissue (26). In mammary tissue, provocative studies have shown
that progesterone receptor-h elicits a response to progesterone
similar to that of estrogen. The biological mechanisms underlying
an effect of progestins in the colon are less clear, although they may
be synergistically amplifying estrogen’s effects. Also, progesterone
induces the isozyme of 17h-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase to
catalyze the conversion of the less potent estrone to the more
potent estradiol (27, 28). This effect has been hypothesized to
explain the increased risk of breast cancer associated with EP
beyond that of E alone (29). The biological mechanisms underlying
an effect of progestins in the colon are less clear, although they may
be synergistically amplifying estrogen’s effects.
Epigenetic events not involving changes in DNA nucleotide
sequences may also play a role. Estrogen and perhaps progestins may
be key factors in the pathway leading to hypermethylation [CpG
island methylator phenotype (CIMP); ref. 30], a central feature
of CRC (31) in which many genes can be silenced. In small studies
of CRC cases, an estimated 28% to 58% were CIMP+ (32–34). In vitro
and animal studies have also suggested that estrogen intervention

reduces DNA methylation of specific genes and restores protective
methylation patterns (31).
Despite the consistency of this study with other observational and clinical trials, there are limitations that should be
considered in interpreting our results. We relied, as have most
observational studies, on self-reports of hormone use. We were
unable to validate hormone use but other studies report good
agreement of self-reported use of PMH and information in medical
records (35–37). Not all eligible subjects were interviewed because
of death, refusal, and other reasons; for laboratory analyses, we
were not able to obtain tissue or have MSI testing completed on all
individuals. We also have a higher proportion of MSI-high cases
than that found in previous studies (18, 38, 39), which may indicate
differences in survival by molecular subtype, an outcome that has
been associated with MSI-high tumor status (40, 41).
The results of this large study support a role for exogenous
hormones in the genesis of CRC in women. However, they modify
the previously held belief, first postulated over 30 years ago by
McMichael and Potter, that estrogen per se is the active agent in
endogenous and exogenous hormone’s effects (25). In future
investigations the mechanisms whereby estrogens and progestins
reduce risk of CRC should be explored.
