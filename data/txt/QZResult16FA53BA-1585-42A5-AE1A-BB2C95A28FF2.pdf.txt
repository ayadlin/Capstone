Abstract

Author Manuscript

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is commonly activated in colon cancer. mTOR
complex 1 (mTORC1) is a major downstream target of the PI3K/ATK pathway and activates
protein synthesis by phosphorylating key regulators of mRNA translation and ribosome synthesis.
Rapamycin analogs Everolimus and Temsirolimus are non-ATP-competitive mTORC1 inhibitors,
and suppress proliferation and tumor angiogenesis and invasion. We now show that apoptosis
plays a key role in their anti-tumor activities in colon cancer cells and xenografts through the DR5,
FADD and caspase-8 axis, and is strongly enhanced by TRAIL and 5-fluorouracil. The induction
of DR5 by rapalogs is mediated by the ER stress regulator and transcription factor CHOP, but not
the tumor suppressor p53, upon rapid and sustained inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, and
attenuated by eIF4E expression. ATP-competitive mTOR/PI3K inhibitors also promote DR5
induction and FADD-dependent apoptosis in colon cancer cells. These results establish activation
of ER stress and the death receptor pathway as a novel anticancer mechanism of mTOR inhibitors.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents a major cancer burden worldwide, with over 1 million
new cases and over 600, 000 deaths annually (1). CRC is the third leading cause of cancer
death in the United States (1). The cancer genome project has greatly advanced our
understanding of cancer biology in the last decade, and identified frequent somatic
mutations in oncogenic kinases. For example, deregulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling
pathway is estimated in 60-70% of human colon cancers, leading to enhanced cell survival
and proliferation (2). Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine protein
kinase that regulates cell proliferation, motility, survival, protein synthesis, and transcription
(3). mTORC1 is one of the two major mTOR complexes and a main downstream effector of
PI3K/PTEN/AKT signaling in response to growth factors. mTORC1 phosphorylates
downstream targets to increase protein synthesis, including S6K1 and its substrate ribosomal
protein RPS6 and translation initiation inhibitor 4E-BP1 (3-4). Upon phosphorylation, 4EBP1 frees the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) for cap-dependent mRNA
translation. Hyperactivation of mTOR is an early and common event in colon cancer (5-7),
and generally caused by deregulation of upstream components (3).

Author Manuscript

Rapamycin is a natural product and non-ATP competitive inhibitor of mTORC1. Rapamycin
binds to cytosolic FK binding protein (FKBP12) with high affinity, and the resulting
FKBP12/rapamycin complex then interacts with mTOR1 and inhibits its function by
interfering with mTOR kinase activity or complex assembly (3). Prolonged exposure to
Rapamycin can inhibit mTORC2 in some cells (3). Phosphorylation of 4E- BP1 in cancer
cells has been reported to be much less susceptible to inhibition by Rapamycin than that of
RPS6, while the underlying mechanisms are not well understood (8). A number of
Rapamycin analogs with improved pharmacologic properties, also referred as rapalogs, have
been developed. Everolimus (RAD001), an orally available derivative of Rapamycin, and
Temsirolimus (CCI-779) have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with
refractory renal cell cancer, and in clinical trials for other solid tumors including colon
cancer (9-10). ATP-competitive mTOR or mTOR/PI3K dual inhibitors such as Torin-1 and
NVP-BEZ235 have recently been developed. Antitumor activities of mTOR inhibitors are
associated with suppression of tumor growth, angiogenesis and invasion (3).

Apoptosis is regulated by the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway (11), and extrinsic pathway
(12). The mitochondrial pathway is activated through the Bcl-2 family members Bax and
Bak (11, 13). The extrinsic pathway is activated upon binding of pro-apoptotic ligands to the
extended TNF family receptors, and negatively regualted by decoy receptors (DcRs) (12).
For example, the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) binds to
death receptor 4 (DR4), and death receptor 5 (DR5), which further recruit the adaptor Fasassociated protein with death domain (FADD) and caspase-8, leading to caspase-8 activation
(12). FADD is required for Fas- or TRAIL-induced apoptosis (12). Induction of apoptosis is

an important mechanisms of many anticancer drugs (14). Colon cancer cells deficient in
BAX are highly resistant to anticancer agent-induced apoptosis (15-18), while the role of
extrinsic pathway is much less understood.

Author Manuscript

mTOR inhibitors, particularly rapalogs, induce cancer cell apoptosis in vivo, but not in
culture at concentrations that inhibit p70S6K or RPS6 phosphorylation, or cell proliferation
(3-4). The significance of apoptosis induction in the anti-tumor activities of mTOR
inhibitors remains undefined. In this study, we show that both rapalogs and ATP-competitive
mTOR inhibitors can activate the extrinsic apoptotic pathway in CRC cells via the DR5/
FADD/Caspase-8 axis upon rapid inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. Everolimus
strongly synergizes with TRAIL and chemotherapy to induce FADD and DR5-dependent
apoptosis. FADD-dependent apoptosis is required for the antitumor activities of Everolimus
in xenografts. These results demonstrate activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway as an
antitumor mechanism of mTOR inhibitors.

Results
Rapalogs induce the activation of the death receptor pathway during apoptosis in colon
cancer cells

Author Manuscript

Everolimus and Temsirolimus induced classical apoptosis in HCT116 colon cancer cells by
48 hours at high concentrations (18-20 uM), which was unaffected in BAX knockout (BAXKO) or BAX/BAK double knockout (BAX/BAK DKO) HCT 116 cells (Fig. 1A, Fig. S1AB). The apoptosis was preceeded by induction of DR5 as early as 8 hours followed by
cleavage of caspase-3, −8 and −9, and Bid within 24 hours (Fig. 1B). RT-PCR analysis on a
panel of extrinsic apoptotic regulators showed a strong induction of DR4, DR5 and TNFR1
(Fig. 1C). Significant apoptosis was induced in three other CRC lines including RKO,
DLD1, and HT29 (Fig. 1D) by both agents, and the expression of extrinsic apoptotic
regulators most notably DR5 (Fig. 1E, 1F and Fig. S2). Unexpectedly, the treatment of
rapalogs inhibited 4E-BP1 phosphorylation much more rapidly and profoundly compared to
RPS6 phosphorylation (Fig. 1B and 1F). These results indicate that rapalogs activate the
death receptor pathway in CRC cells likely through inhibiting 4E-BP1 phosphorylation.
Rapid dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 by rapalogs leads to induction of ER stress and DR5

DR5 transcription is regulated by p53 following DNA damage (19-20) or CHOP after ER

status (Fig. 1, Figs. S2, S3A and S3 B), an p53 levels did not increase by either agent in p53
WT cells (Fig. S3). Interestingly, inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and induction of
CHOP were detected as early as 4 hours, followed by DR5 in 12 hours, only in cells treated
with Everolimus at 20 μM (Fig. 2A). Overexpression of eIF4E attenuated CHOP, DR5
induction and caspase-3 cleavage (Fig. 2B). In contrast, inhibition of 4EBP1
phosphorylation, induction of CHOP or DR5, apoptosis was absent in cells treated with
Everolimus at 50 nM or 1 μM, despite more effective inhibition of RPS6 phosphorylation
(Fig. 2A) and reversible growth suppression (data not shown). However, knockdown of

raptor, rictor, or mTOR by siRNA did not cause apoptosis or loss of p4EBP1 (Fig. S3C-D),
supporting mTOR-independent 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in CRC cells (22).
Furthermore, Everolimus treatment led to CHOP recruitment to the DR5 promoter (Fig. 2C),
and CHOP knockdown by siRNA attenuated the induction of DR4 and DR5, as well as
apoptosis and caspase activation by rapalogs (Fig. 2D and 2E). Interestingly, rapalogsinduced apoptosis was associated with strong activation of multiple ER stress markers
besides CHOP induction, such as XBP1 splicing, and upregulation of BIP, Ero1-Lα and
IRE1α (Fig. 2F). These results demonstrate that CHOP is required for DR5 and apoptosis
induction by rapalogs upon rapid inhibition of the 4E-BP1/eIF4 axis and activation of ER
stress in HCT 116 cells.
DR5 and caspase-8 are required for rapalog-induced apoptosis in CRC cells

Author Manuscript

We further determined if DR5 is required for apoptosis induced by Everolimus and
Temsirolimus. Knockdown of DR5 by siRNA significantly suppressed apoptosis and
cleavage of caspase-8 and −3 (Fig. 3A and 3B, and Fig. S4). Caspase-8 is an essential
initiator caspase of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway downstream of the death receptors.
Caspase-8 stable knockdown significantly suppressed apoptosis induced by Everolimus and
Temsirolimus (Fig. 3C and 3D), and largely rescued the long-term survival of HCT116 cells
(Fig. 3E and 3F). These results demonstrate that DR5 and caspase-8 mediate mTOR
inhibitor-induced apoptosis and long-term growth suppression in CRC cells.
FADD is required for rapalog-induced caspase-8 activation and apoptosis in CRC cells

Author Manuscript

FADD mediates caspase-8 activation downstream of Fas, TNF and death receptors. We
further determined the role of extrinsic pathway by generating the FADD knockout (FADDKO) HCT116 cells (Fig. 4A and 4B). Apoptosis and activation of caspase−3 and −8 induced
by Everolimus and Temsirolimus was blocked in FADD-KO cells to near completion (Fig.
4C and 4D), and confirmed by flow cytometry (Fig. S5A and S5B). FADD-KO HCT116
cells were highly resistant to both agents in long-term clongenic assay (Fig. 4E and 4F).
Stable expression a FADD allele lacking the caspass-8 recruiting domain (FADD-DN) also
blocked apoptosis and activation of caspases-8 and -3 in HCT 116 and RKO cells (Fig. 4G
and 4H, Fig. S5C-F). These data demonstrate that FADD-dependent caspase-8 activation is
responsible for apoptosis and long-term growth suppression induced by rapalogs in CRC
cells.
Induction of DR5 and FADD-dependent apoptosis by ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors

Author Manuscript

ATP-competitive mTOR or mTOR/PI3K inhibitors block 4E-BP1 phosphorylation more
effectively than rapalogs and induce apoptosis in cancer cells. Treatment of Torin 1 or NVPBEZ235 induced expression of DR4, DR5 or TRAIL in HCT116 cells, and FADDdependent apoptosis (Fig. 5A, 5B and 5C, Figs. S1C-D and S6). Interestingly, Torin 1induced apoptosis was dose-dependent and associated with induction of CHOP and
complete inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation but incomplete inhibition of RPS6
phosphorylation (Fig. 5C). Similar to rapalogs, Torin 1 at 50 nM or 1 μM completely
inhibited RPS6 phosphorylation by 24 hours, while induced no detectable apoptosis in HCT
116 (Fig. 5C). These results strongly suggest that mTOR inhibitors activate ER stress and

the extrinsic apoptotic pathway upon selective inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (Fig.
5D).
Everolimus sensitizes CRCs to other anticancer agents via the extrinsic pathway
mTOR inhibitors activate apoptosis via p53-independent induction of DR5. We further
hypothesized that they might sensitize CRCs to DR5 ligand TRAIL or chemotherapy that
induces DR5 via p53 such as 5-FU (Fig. 5D). As expected, TRAIL or 5-FU in combination
with Everolimus strongly induced activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 compared to single
agent (Fig. 6A). Apoptosis induced by the combinations was largely blocked in FADD-KO
cells or by DR5 siRNA (Fig. 6B and 6C). The combination of 5-FU and Everolimus
enhanced DR5 induction (Fig. 6D). Therefore, Everolimus sensitizes CRC cells to killing
via the activation of DR5 and the extrinsic pathway.

Apoptosis mediates the antitumor effect of Everolimus in a xenograft model

Author Manuscript

To establish a potential role of apoptosis in the anti-tumor activities of mTOR inhibitors in
vivo, we treated mice bearing WT and FADD-KO HCT116 xenografts with 5 mg/kg
Everolimus or the vehicle by oral gavage daily for 10 days. Everolimus treatment caused
80% reduction in tumor growth in the parental tumors, but less than 30% in the FADD-KO
tumors (Fig. 7A). Everolimus-treated tumors showed induction of DR5 associated with
strong reduction in 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (Fig. 7B). Everolimus-treated tumors showed
marked apoptosis in WT tumors as shown by TUNEL and active caspase-3 staining, which
was significantly blocked in FADD-KO tumors (Fig. 7C and 7D). The inhibition of 4E-BP1
phosphorylation or angiogenesis was similar in WT and FADD-KO tumors in response to
Everolimus (Fig. 7E and 7F). These data demonstrate an important role of the extrinsic
apoptotic pathway and inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in the antitumor activities of
Everolimus in vivo.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

The PI3K/PTEN/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway plays a key role in cell proliferation,
survival and transformation (14). Recent studies suggest that activation of mTOR signaling
is an early event in colon cancer, and its inhibition can lead to suppression of cell cycle
progression, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell motility and metastasis (5-7).
Our current study establishes that high dose mTOR inhibitors activate CHOP-dependent
induction of DR5 and apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway in colon cancer cells, upon rapid
and sustained inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. To our knowledge, this is the first
report to definitively show that apoptosis induction contributes significantly to the antitumor
activities of mTOR inhibitors such as rapalogs in vitro and in vivo.
It is well established that, at sub micromolar concentrations, rapamycin or rapalogs do not
inhibit phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 or cause apoptosis in cancer cells, despite effective
inbibition of p70SK6 or RPS6 phosphorylation. These lower doses can promote formation
of stress granules, reversible cell cycle arrest, and even apoptosis- and chemo-resistance
(23-24). Interestingly, published work indicated that Temsirolimus (CCI-779) can reach high
micromolars in the plasma of cancer patients (25-27). The highest weekly dose of CCI-779

of 250 mg/m2 (whole blood exposure of 15.5 μM) was associated with improved medium
and overall survival, including a complete response, in heavily pretreated renal cancer
patients (25). The maximum drug concentaions in tumor tissues and underlying
mechanmisms are however not known. We believe our findings therefore provide a
potentially novel and clinically relevant antitumor mechanism of rapalogs, particularily in
extrondinary responders whose tumors contain activating mTOR mutations are recently
reported (28-29).

Author Manuscript

Emerging evidence supports targeting 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and translation in cancer.
Our findings suggest that exposure to high doses of rapalogs causes a profound loss of 4EBP1 phosphorylation and mTOR activity, both are likely required for the induction of ER
stress, CHOP and DR5 and subsequent killing of cancer cells. This is consistent with that
competitive eIF4E/eIF4G inhibitor 4EGI-1 induces apoptosis (30-31), mTOR-independent
4E-BP1 phosphorylation is associated with resistance to mTOR inhibitors (22, 32-34), and
unresolved ER stress upon persistent CHOP induction leading to DR5-mediated apoptosis
(35). However, the precise mechanism underlying inhibition of p4EBP1, translation and ER
stress warrants further investigation, and we could not rule out mTOR-independent effects. It
is tempting to speculate that intermittent high dosing of rapalogs promotes more robust
antitumor responses via induction of ER stress and apoptosis in mTOR addicted cancers
partiuclairy those with activating mTOR mutations (28-29).

Author Manuscript

The major challenge in the clinical use of mTOR inhibitors is the lack of biomarkers or clear
resistance mechanisms (10). Induction of ER stress, death receptors and ligands, 4E-BP1
dephosphorylation and eIF4E/4E-BP ratio (36) might be potential biomarkers for selecting
responders or monitoring responses. Rapalogs generally have a favorable safety profile and
non-overlapping side effects with ATP-competitive inhibitors or DNA damaging agents. We
showed that Rapalogs strongly synergize with TRAIL or 5-FU to induced cancer cell killing.
Inhibitors of a variety of oncoproteins such as EGFR, MET, VEGFR, Raf, Hsp90, or Bcl-2/
Bcl-xL, can activate mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in colon cancer cells (17-18, 37-38)
Therefore, their rational combination with rapalogs might offer hopes to patients with
chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colon cancers (10) by activating both the intrinsic and
extrinsic pathways.

Author Manuscript

Apoptosis is part of the normal turn-over of intestinal epithelium and plays an important role
in colon cancer biology, therapy and prevention (39-40), while its regulation can be different
in normal and cancer cells and explored thearpuetically. For example, FADD or casaspe-8 is
required for normal development and homeostasis of gut epithelium by suppressing RIP-3
dependent necrosis in mice (41), but dispensable for the survival of human CRC cells such
as HCT116 and RKO. Rencent studies suggest functional links of ER stress and mTOR (42),
and sensitization to ER stress upon abnormal activation of mTOR in normal but not cancer
cells (43-44). Rapamycin or rapalogs suppress intestinal carcinogenesis in mouse models
with little or no long-term side effects (45-46) It will be important to determine if and how
ER stress selectively kills cells with aberrant Wnt signaling, the driver of virtually all CRC
(2).

In conclusion, our work demonstrates an essential role of the death receptor-mediated
apoptosis upon inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in the antitumor activities of mTOR
inhibitors in CRC cells and xenografts. These results provide a better understanding and
potential biomarkers of the pro-apoptotic action of mTOR inhibitors.
