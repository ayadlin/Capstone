ABSTRACT:
DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) and histone deacetylase inhibitors
(HDACi) are under investigation for the treatment of cancer, including the plasma
cell malignancy multiple myeloma (MM). Evidence exists that DNA damage and repair
contribute to the cytotoxicity mediated by the DNMTi decitabine. Here, we investigated
the DNA damage response (DDR) induced by decitabine in MM using 4 human MM
cell lines and the murine 5T33MM model. In addition, we explored how the HDACi
JNJ-26481585 affects this DDR. Decitabine induced DNA damage (gamma-H2AX
foci formation), followed by a G0/G1- or G2/M-phase arrest and caspase-mediated
apoptosis. JNJ-26481585 enhanced the anti-MM effect of decitabine both in vitro
and in vivo. As JNJ-26481585 did not enhance decitabine-mediated gamma-H2AX
foci formation, we investigated the DNA repair response towards decitabine and/or
JNJ-26481585. Decitabine augmented RAD51 foci formation (marker for homologous
recombination (HR)) and/or 53BP1 foci formation (marker for non-homologous end
joining (NHEJ)). Interestingly, JNJ-26481585 negatively affected basal or decitabineinduced RAD51 foci formation. Finally, B02 (RAD51 inhibitor) enhanced decitabinemediated apoptosis. Together, we report that decitabine-induced DNA damage
stimulates HR and/or NHEJ. JNJ-26481585 negatively affects RAD51 foci formation,
thereby providing an additional explanation for the combinatory effect between
decitabine and JNJ-26481585.

INTRODUCTION

overall survival is accomplished, the vast majority of
patients relapses and develops non-responsive disease,
demonstrating the further need for novel drugs and new
therapeutic approaches.
Epigenetic modulating agents have shown
considerable preclinical and clinical efficacy in
hematological malignancies [9, 10]. The cytidine analog
5-aza-2’deoxycytidine or decitabine is such an epigenetic
modulating agent acting as an irreversible inhibitor of
DNA methyltransferases (DNMTi). Upon replication,
decitabine is incorporated into DNA thereby trapping
DNMT enzymes in a covalent way resulting in DNA-

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell
malignancy characterized by accumulation of MM cells
in the bone marrow (BM) [1]. Nowadays, patients receive
induction therapy with different combinations of drugs
including proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory
agents, alkylators and corticosteroids based on risk
stratification. Next, if eligible, patients undergo high
dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell
transplantion and/or consolidation or maintenance
therapy [2-8]. Even though significant prolongation of

protein adducts [11]. The cytotoxic effects of decitabine
can then be explained by two modes of action. First,
trapping of DNMT enzymes leads to depletion of DNMT
and the cell loses its ability to methylate DNA. The
result is a genome-wide loss of methylation leading to
re-activation of silenced genes, genomic instability and
related anti-tumor effects. Second, the formation of DNAprotein adducts results in the activation of a DNA damage
response (DDR) that can ultimately result in apoptosis.
The activation of a DDR is initiated by recognition
of DNA lesions followed by cell cycle arrest and
recruitment of DNA repair proteins mediating repair of
the lesion. Depending on the type of lesion, different
repair pathways are elicited. Double strand break repair
is mediated by homologous recombination (HR) or nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). NHEJ takes place
throughout all phases of the cell cycle and is considered to
be error-prone. In contrast, HR takes place during S- and
G2/M-phase and is dependent on the sister chromatid and
considered to be more error-free. Consequently, during
S- and G2/M-phase, the balance between NHEJ and HR
determines which pathway will be used to repair DNA
lesions [12]. Considering DNA repair in MM, it is thought
that abnormal DNA repair pathways play an important
role in the disease onset, progression and occurrence
of resistance. This abnormal DNA repair is the result
of (epigenetic) dysregulation and/or polymorphisms of
genes involved in DNA repair and an accumulation of
chromosomal abnormalities in MM [13]. For example,
several polymorphisms in genes involved in NHEJ have
been described in MM. In addition, NHEJ activity seems
aberrant in MM cell lines and this influences the response
towards ionizing radiation [14]. Furthermore, the activity
of HR appears increased in MM [15].
Only a few studies have addressed the involvement
of DNA repair in response to decitabine. In mammalian
cells, HR has been implicated in tolerance towards DNA
protein cross-links [16]. Recently, it was demonstrated
that in Chinese hamster ovary cells, decitabine caused
DNA lesions and triggered Fanconi Anemia-dependent
HR. Fanconi Anemia-defective cells appeared to be more
sensitive to decitabine compared to Fanconi Anemia-wildtype cells, due to the predominance of error-prone NHEJ
in Fanconi Anemia-defective cells resulting into cytotoxic
chromosome aberrations [17]. However, HR and NHEJ
activity upon decitabine exposure have not yet been
adequately addressed in MM.
The histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi)
form another class of epigenetic modulating agents
with considerable pre-clinical anti-MM activity [10].
Furthermore, HDACi showed beneficial effects in
combination with conventional agents in relapsed
MM patients [18, 19]. Today, several links between
acetylation, HDACi and DNA repair mechanisms have
been established. It is realized now that protein acetylation
influences the recruitment and expression of DNA repair
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

proteins and therefore can be used as a target to modify
DNA repair pathways in response to different DNA
damaging agents [20].
There has been considerable interest in combining
DNMTi and HDACi to enhance the anti-tumor effects
of both agents [21]. The mechanism of action involves
a broad spectrum of effects that range from true
epigenetic changes, chromatin- and DNA-related effects,
disruption of the acetylome and micro-environmental
effects [10, 22]. Previous studies on these combinations
demonstrated alterations in gene expression that may
correlate with an enhanced apoptotic effect and direct
modulation of downstream apoptotic effectors [23-28].
Alternatively, the combinatory effects of decitabine and
HDACi could be related to the DDR and modulation of
the DNA repair pathways. So it would be interesting to
investigate which DNA repair pathways are activated
upon decitabine treatment in MM and how HDACi can
affect this. Therefore, we investigated the anti-MM effects
of decitabine alone and in combination with the HDACi
JNJ-26481585 (JNJ-585) using human myeloma cell lines
(HMCLs) and the syngeneic murine 5T33MM model and
tried to unravel the underlying mechanisms with a focus
on cell cycle regulation and DNA damage/repair.

RESULTS
Decitabine showed anti-MM effects both in vitro
and in vivo
To evaluate the anti-MM effects of decitabine,
we treated 4 HMCLs with different concentrations of
decitabine and determined the percentage apoptotic
cells. OPM-2 and NCI-H929 cells showed significant
induction of apoptosis from 3 days on, while RPMI-8226
and JJN3 cells were more sensitive showing increased
apoptosis already after 2 days (Figure 1A). Both in OPM2 and RPMI-8226 cells, western blot analysis revealed
a simultaneous increase in cleavage of caspase-9, -8
and -3, PARP-1 and the anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1
(Figure 1B). In addition, decitabine upregulated the proapoptotic protein BIM (all isoforms) in both cell lines
(Figure 1B) and quantitative real-time PCR revealed that
this is transcriptionally mediated (Supplementary Figure
S1). To determine the potential therapeutic effects of
decitabine in vivo, we treated 5T33MM inoculated mice
with increasing doses of decitabine. Tumor load in the
BM and serum M-spike were significantly lower for all
decitabine treatment groups (Figure 1C). Of note, we
detected no significant weight loss of the mice indicating
no major toxicity (data not shown). We also performed
a similar experiment in a survival setup. 5T33MM mice
treated with decitabine had significant higher survival
rates when compared to vehicle treated mice: 29 and 36

cells accumulated all in G0/G1-phase, while RPMI-8226
cells slightly accumulated in G2/M-phase (Figure 2B). As
the CDK-inhibitor p27 is known to regulate both G1 and
G2 checkpoints [32], we next evaluated p27 expression
and its upstream regulator SKP-2. Decitabine treatment
simultaneously upregulated p27 and decreased SKP-2
expression in both OPM-2 and RPMI-8226 cells (Figure
2C).

Decitabine negatively affects cell cycle progression
To investigate the mechanisms underlying the
anti-MM activity of decitabine, we next determined how
decitabine influences cell cycle progression in HMCLs.
Therefore, we assessed DNA content together with
BrdU-incorporation at timepoints when there is minimal
induction of apoptosis. At control conditions, BrdU
incorporation was higher for RPMI-8226 and JJN3 cells
compared to OPM-2 and NCI-H929 cells. For all cell
lines tested, we observed a significant decrease of BrdU
incorporation upon treatment with decitabine compared to
control (Figure 2A). Concordantly, DNA content analysis
revealed that all cell lines showed a decrease of cells in
the S-phase (Figure 2B). OPM-2, NCI-H929 and JJN3

foci
The decitabine-mediated effects on cell cycle
progression indicate an activation of cell cycle checkpoints
in response to DNA damage. Therefore, we assessed
whether decitabine could induce a DNA damage response
in HMCLs. For this, we treated OPM-2 and RPMI-8226

cells with decitabine for 24 and 48 hours and analyzed
gamma-H2AX foci formation, a widely used DNA
damage marker. The alkylator melphalan was included
as a positive control. We observed that both cell lines
already have around 15 to 25% gamma-H2AX positive
cells in control conditions. After decitabine treatment, the
percentages of gamma-H2AX positive cells significantly
increased in both OPM-2 and RPMI-8226 cells compared
to control and this already after 24 hours (Figure 3A,
B). Compared to melphalan, decitabine led to lower
percentages of gamma-H2AX positive cells.

inhibitor (HDACi), namely JNJ-26481585 (JNJ-585).
Previously, we have proven that JNJ-585 has potent
anti-MM effects both in vitro and in vivo [31]. To assess
whether decitabine and JNJ-585 have synergistic anti-MM
effects, we treated OPM-2 cells with different doses of
each agent alone and in combination for 72 hours. Using
the Cell Titer-Glo viability assay, we demonstrated a
synergistic interaction between both agents as evidenced
by combination indexes well below 1 (Supplementary
Figure S2). Next, we tested whether JNJ-585 could
enhance decitabine-mediated apoptosis using suboptimal
doses of both agents. As shown in Figure 4, apoptosis
was further enhanced in all cell lines tested and for OPM2 and RPMI-8226 cells this was also associated with
combinatory effects on cleavage of caspases, PARP-1 and
MCL-1 (Figure 4A, B). Simultaneously, we also evaluated
the effect of the combination on cell cycle progression.

JNJ-585 alone induced a clear G0/G1-phase arrest in all
cell lines, though less pronounced in RPMI-8226 cells
(Figure 4C). In OPM-2 and JJN3 cells, the G0/G1-phase
arrest remained after combination treatment, while in
RPMI-8226 cells a clear and significant increase of cells
in the subG1-phase was observed compared to single
agents (Figure 4C). To confirm the in vitro data, we then
tested if JNJ-585 could potentiate decitabine-mediated
effects in the 5T33MM model. Indeed, the combination of
a suboptimal dose of decitabine and JNJ-585 significantly
augmented the effects of decitabine on tumor progression

and survival (Figure 4D, E).

JNJ-585 alters the DNA repair response towards
decitabine-induced DNA damage
We next investigated the effects of JNJ585 on decitabine-mediated DNA damage. Using
immunofluorescence analysis, we found that suboptimal
doses of JNJ-585 did not change the baseline percentage
of gamma-H2AX positive cells in OPM-2 and RPMI8226 cells (Figure 5A). In addition, the combination

showed similar but not additional numbers of gammaH2AX positive cells compared to decitabine (Figure 5A).
This suggests that decitabine-induced DNA damage is
not enhanced by JNJ-585. Next, we hypothesized that
JNJ-585 might alter the DNA repair response towards
decitabine, thereby enhancing the cytotoxicity of the
DNA damage induced by decitabine. As previously
mentioned, double strand break repair is involved in
decitabine-mediated DNA lesions [16, 17]. Therefore,
we analyzed the contribution of HR and NHEJ by
evaluating the presence of respectively RAD51 and
53BP1 foci. Both OPM-2 and RPMI-8226 cells already
showed RAD51 and 53BP1 foci formation in basal
conditions (Figure 5B and Supplementary Figure S3-

S6). Decitabine alone significantly increased the number
of 53BP1 positive cells in both OPM-2 and RPMI-8226
cells, while RAD51 positive cells were increased only in
RPMI-8226 cells (Figure 5B and Supplementary Figure
S3-S6). Interestingly, JNJ-585 alone did not alter the
percentage of RAD51 positive cells compared to control
conditions in RPMI-8226 cells. However, the increase
in RAD51 positivity by decitabine was completely
abrogated by JNJ-585 (Figure 5B and Supplementary
Figure S3-S6). Moreover, in OPM-2 cells, JNJ-585 even
decreased the baseline presence of RAD51 foci and this
was even more pronounced in the combination. Although
significance was not reached, JNJ-585 slightly increased
the formation of 53BP1 foci in both cell lines (Figure

Targeting DNA repair pathways appears useful in
combination with decitabine

5B and Supplementary Figure S3-S6). The combination
increased 53BP1 foci formation to a similar extent as
decitabine. We next evaluated whether JNJ-585 could
modulate expression of the HR-related genes RAD51,
BRCA1 and BRCA2. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed
that JNJ-585 could decrease the expression of RAD51 in
both RPMI-8226 and OPM-2 cells. In addition, BRCA2
expression was downregulated in OPM-2 cells. There was
also tendency for downregulation of BRCA1 expression in
OPM-2 cells but significance was not reached (Figure 5C).

The above experiments indicate that by targeting
DNA repair responses, the cytotoxic effects of decitabine
might be enhanced. Here, we chose to target RAD51 and
PARP1/2 by respectively B02 and ABT-888. B02 is a
specific RAD51 inhibitor that has not been used in MM or
related disorders [33, 34], while ABT-888 (Veliparib) is a
PARP1/2 inhibitor [35]. B02 alone was cytotoxic in both
OPM-2 and RPMI-8226 cells as evidenced by an increased
percentage of apoptotic cells while ABT-888 alone did not

show any cytotoxicity (Figure 5D). Co-treatment of cells
with B02 sensitized both OPM-2 and RPMI-8226 cells to

compared to single agents (Figure 5D). Co-treatment with

work showing the anti-proliferative effects of decitabine
[40, 41]. In addition, BrdU incorporation decreased upon
decitabine exposure what correlates with the drop of cells
in S-phase and the observed arrest. Cell cycle arrest by
decitabine is often associated with p21 upregulation [40,
42]. However, the role of the CDK-inhibitor p27 herein
is less clear. In association with the cell cycle arrest, we
observed an upregulation of p27. It has been described
that p27 protein expression is stabilized in response to
DNA damage and may be part of a DDR pathway related
to the detrimental effects of continuous DNA damage [43].
Furthermore, we showed a simultaneous drop in SKP-2
expression. SKP-2 is responsible for p27 degradation [44],
thereby explaining the observed accumulation of p27. This
indicates that SKP-2 may be downregulated in response
to decitabine-mediated DNA damage what results in p27
accumulation and subsequent cell cycle arrest. Indeed,
earlier reports demonstrated SKP-2 downregulation and
p27 accumulation in response to DNA damage [45, 46].
Our observation that decitabine increased the
percentages of cells having more than 10 gamma-H2AX
foci is in agreement with previous studies showing
the DNA-damaging effects of DNMTi [17, 39, 40,
47]. Compared to melphalan, decitabine led to lower
percentages of gamma-H2AX positive cells demonstrating
that melphalan is more potent to induce DNA damage. Also
at the basal level, we could already detect a fair amount
of gamma-H2AX positive cells what is in line with a
previous report showing constitutive DNA damage in MM
[48]. Interestingly, the induction of gamma-H2AX positive
cells by decitabine was similar between RPMI-8226 and
OPM-2 cells and therefore cannot explain the earlier
apoptosis induction in RPMI-8226 cells. This suggest that,
not only the amount of gamma-H2AX positive cells per
se, but also the ability to repair decitabine-induced DNA
lesions determines if a cell will undergo apoptosis. HR
has been implicated in the response towards DNA-protein
cross links [16]. Furthermore, Orta et al. showed earlier
that decitabine could induce both RAD51 and 53BP1 foci
formation and proposed that HR governs protection while
NHEJ results in accumulation of cytotoxic chromosome
aberrations [17].Using 53BP1 and RAD51 as a marker
for respectively NHEJ and HR, we demonstrate that
OPM-2 and RPMI-8226 cells have a certain degree of
basal activity of both repair pathways. Upon decitabine
exposure, RAD51 foci formation remained at basal
level in OPM-2 cells, indicating that decitabine did not
stimulate signaling towards HR in OPM-2 cells. The
lack of induction of RAD51 foci in OPM-2 cells was
furthermore reflected by the accumulation of OPM-2 cells
in G0/G1-phase after decitabine exposure. Concordantly,
53BP1 foci formation was induced by decitabine what
reflects NHEJ stimulation in an attempt to repair most
of the DNA damage. Nevertheless, as RAD51 positivity
remained at basal level, part of the damage might be
repaired by HR repair. This is further supported by the

DISCUSSION
Epigenetic agents and in particular DNMTi and
HDACi are under intense investigation for their use
in cancer therapy [21]. Better understanding of the
underlying molecular effects of these agents will facilitate
the translation into the clinic. Here, we investigated the
possible induction of a DDR by decitabine in MM and
how this is affected by JNJ-585 and different DNA repair
inhibitors.
Using a panel of HMCLs, we observed the
induction of apoptosis in response to decitabine at
different timepoints. In addition to the HMCLs, we also
demonstrate significant anti-MM effects of decitabine
using the 5T33MM model. Previous work already
demonstrated a difference in sensitivity to decitabine using
a broad panel of HMCLs [36]. We confirm that RPMI8226 and JJN3 cells display a rapid onset of apoptosis
and thus a high sensitivity to decitabine. The effects on
downstream apoptotic proteins were similar in OPM-2 and
RPMI-8226 cells. Both cell lines displayed clear cleavage
of caspase proteins and PARP-1 when significant amounts
of apoptosis were detected. Simultaneously, pro-apoptotic
BIM expression was elevated both at the transcriptional
and translational level. This is in agreement with our
previous study where we showed the epigenetic regulation
of BIM in MM [29]. We also observed cleavage of antiapoptotic MCL-1 simultaneously with caspase cleavage.
In human, three splice variants of MCL-1 have been
described, namely the anti-apoptotic isoform MCL-1L
and the pro-apoptotic isoforms MCL-1S and MCL-1ES.
At the post-translational level, caspase-mediated MCL-1
cleavage has also been observed [37, 38]. This supports
our results that MCL-1 cleavage is caspase-mediated. It
is also in line with the observation of cleavage of MCL-1
upon AZA treatment in MM1.S cells [39].
One aspect that may determine sensitivity to
decitabine is the rate of decitabine incorporation.
BrdU incorporation can be used to evaluate import
and incorporation of nucleosides necessary for DNA
replication and DNA repair. We observed that RPMI-8226
and JJN3 cells incorporate more BrdU at basal conditions
compared to OPM-2 and NCI-H929 cells. In analogy,
decitabine incorporation will be higher in RPMI-8226
and JJN3 cells what may result in a faster accumulation
of lethal levels of DNA damage compared to OPM-2
and NCI-H929 cells. Preceding apoptosis, a significant
amount of cells accumulated in the G0/G1- or G2/Mphase upon decitabine treatment. This confirms earlier

cells. In contrast to OPM-2 cells, both 53BP1 and RAD51
foci formation was induced by decitabine in RPMI-8226
cells. Since these cells were arrested in G2/M-phase, both
NHEJ and HR seemed to be stimulated and may thus
compete with each other to repair DNA [12]. Given that
NHEJ is more error-prone compared to HR, the balance
between the two pathways may eventually determine
the occurrence of (lethal) chromosome aberrations
and thus cytotoxicity [17]. However, we have to note
that abnormalities in different DNA repair pathways
in different cell lines may determine which pathway is
dominant over another and if DNA lesions are successfully
repaired. For example, RPMI-8226 and to a lesser extent
OPM-2 cells have impaired capacity to successfully
complete NHEJ [14]. This impaired capacity may affect
the accumulation of cytotoxic chromosomal aberrations.
Similar to previous studies, we observed that
the combination between decitabine and the HDACi
JNJ-585 had synergistic anti-MM effects which were
associated with enhanced caspase, PARP-1 and MCL1 cleavage compared to either agent alone [25-28, 49].
We also confirmed the combinatory effects of decitabine
and JNJ-585 in vivo. At the dose used in our study,
JNJ-585 did not increase gamma-H2AX foci formation
on itself, while the level of gamma-H2AX positivity
between decitabine and the combination was similar. This
prompted us to investigate how the DNA repair response
towards decitabine is influenced in combination with JNJ585. In RPMI-8226 cells, JNJ-585 maintained RAD51
positivity at basal levels in response to decitabine while
in OPM-2 cells JNJ-585 decreased RAD51 positivity
below basal levels in combination with decitabine. In
contrast, 53BP1 positivity was largely unchanged by JNJ585 in response to decitabine. This indicates that NHEJ
activity remained stable in the combination conditions
while HR activity decreased. The effects on cell cycle
progression in the combination also support this. JNJ585 consistently induced a G0/G1-phase arrest. This
arrest was stronger than for decitabine and was also
sustained in the combination in OPM-2 and JJN3 cells.
Importantly, at the time of the G0/G1-arrest, decitabineinduced DNA damage was already present as evidenced
by the significant higher gamma-H2AX formation in the
combination. Thus, because of the G0/G1-arrest induction
(after decitabine-mediated DNA damage) by JNJ-585
and/or the inhibitory effects on HR, it seems that the
cells’ repair capacity becomes more and more restricted
to NHEJ. This then may result in a faster and stronger
accumulation of chromosomal aberrations compared
to decitabine alone, hence explaining the enhanced
cytotoxic effects of the combination. Collectively, we
report that JNJ-585 negatively influenced HR-mediated
DNA repair in response to decitabine by inducing a G0/
G1-phase arrest, inhibiting RAD51 foci formation and/or
downregulating expression of key HR genes. These effects
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

likely shift the balance of DNA repair to NHEJ and are in
favor of the hypothesis that DNA repair is a factor that
determines the onset of apoptosis by decitabine. The effect
of JNJ-585 on RAD51 are in line with results from others
demonstrating that HDACi downregulate RAD51 in
colon cancer and Chinese hamster ovary cells and inhibit
irradiation-mediated RAD51 foci formation [50, 51].
In analogy, the HDACi SNDX-275 and LBH-589 have
previously been shown to enhance cytotoxic effects of
melphalan and doxorubicin in MM [52, 53]. Interestingly,
the effects of JNJ-585 on HR genes are similar to what has
been described for bortezomib, namely downregulation
of HR-related genes (so called “BRCAness state) [54].
Our results imply that JNJ-585 may also be a candidate
compound to interfere with HR-mediated DNA repair
especially in combination with DNA damaging agents and
point towards the HR pathway being a promising target to
pursue for MM treatment [15].
Finally, we used the RAD51 specific inhibitor B02 to
prove the role of RAD51 in decitabine-induced DDR. B02
alone was cytotoxic indicating that RAD51 is a potential
target in MM, even in the absence of DNA damaging
agents. Furthermore, B02 could sensitize both RPMI-8226
and OPM-2 cells to decitabine. This is in agreement with
the effect of JNJ-585 and again indicates that by inhibiting
RAD51, the repair balance may be shifted towards NHEJ
leading to more cytotoxicity. Unexpectedly, ABT-888,
sensitized RPMI-8226 but not OPM-2 cells to decitabine.
ABT-888 (Veliparib) is a PARP1/2 inhibitor and is a
promising agent in (pre-) clinical development for solid
and hematological malignancies especially in combination
with DNA damaging agents [35, 54-56]. PARP proteins
are mainly implicated in single strand break repair but
have been shown to be important for double strand break
repair as well [57-59]. More specifically, PARP proteins
promote HR by detecting collapsed replication forks and
recruiting DNA repair factors important for HR [60]. In
addition, both NHEJ-inhibiting and -promoting roles
have been described for PARP [61, 62]. Our observation
that ABT-888 enhances decitabine-mediated apoptosis
suggests that PARP1/2 protects cells from decitabineinduced DNA damage, possibly by inhibiting NHEJ [58].
Currently, clinical trials with HDACi are ongoing.
In MM, panobinostat in combination with dexamethasone
and bortezomib was recently shown to overcome
bortezomib-resistance in relapsed/refractory MM patients
[19, 63]. Another HDACi, vorinostat, in combination
with bortezomib had also beneficial effects in refractory/
relapsed patients [18]. Furthermore, a dose escalation
study with JNJ-585 (quisinostat) in combination with
bortezomib and dexamethasone showed a good safety
profile and clinical activity in relapsed MM patients [64].
However, no reports on clinical trials using decitabine in
MM have been published, probably because of absence
of significant clinical activity. This may be explained by
the lack of decitabine incorporation in mature MM cells

which in general have a low proliferation rate. However,
proliferation is augmented in advanced stages and is
considered a bad prognostic factor [65]. In addition,
during normal development, plasma cells transit through
an immature pre-plasmablast stage characterized by
a high proliferation rate [66, 67]. Recently, a similar
MM subpopulation mediating therapeutic resistance
to bortezomib has been identified in MM patients [68].
Thus, when proliferation is higher (ie. in advanced
stages or in pre-plasmablasts), decitabine will probably
be actively incorporated what may result in a clinical
response, especially in combination with a HDACi or
DNA repair inhibitors. Interestingly, Caraux et al. reported
the existence of a residual MM cell population after high
dose melphalan and autologous stem cell transplantation
[69]. Further characterization of this MM population is
desirable as it represents cells that survived induction
therapy with bortezomib and dexamethasone as well as
high-dose melphalan and transplantation. These cells thus
may have an immature phenotype, a high proliferation
rate and ongoing DNA repair activity. Therefore, the use
of other DNA damaging agents such as decitabine and
agents that interfere with DNA repair such as JNJ-585 or
B02 may be useful to target this population at the right
moment during therapy (ie. post-transplant). Furthermore,
it has been suggested that plasticity between pre-plasma
cells and plasma cells is epigenetically regulated and
underlines clinical resistance [70]. Better understanding
of this epigenetic program will be necessary to find out
whether epigenetic modulating agents may be useful to
elucidate key elements of this epigenetic program or may
have a favorable effect on pre-plasma cell – plasma cell
transition in terms of circumventing resistance.
In conclusion, we report that DNA damage plays an
important role in the mechanisms of decitabine-mediated
cytotoxicity in MM. Notably, decitabine is less potent
than for example melphalan in inducing DNA damage
but decitabine also has epigenetic effects, definitely in
combination with HDACi. Furthermore, interfering with
DNA repair pathways using HDACi or more specific DNA
repair inhibitors appears a promising strategy to enhance
decitabine-mediated cytotoxicity. A direct implication
of the data is that deeper understanding of DNA repair
processes in MM cells can lead to more targeted
combinations with DNA damaging agents.

Western blot

100 nuclei were analyzed and nuclei with at least 10 foci
were scored as positive.

Western blot was performed as described previously
[29]. The antibodies used were all purchased from
Cell Signaling (Bioké, Leiden, The Netherlands). The
following clones of antibodies were used: caspase-3
(#9665), caspase-9 (#9502), caspase-8 (#9746), BIM
(C34C5, #2933), MCL-1 (D35A5, #5453), p27 (D37H1,
#3688), SKP-2 (L70, #4313) and ACTIN (#4967).

Prophylactic treatment of 5T33MM mice
The 5T33MM model was maintained as previously
described [30]. At day 0, naive C57BL/KaLwRij mice
were intravenously injected with 5x105 5T33MM
cells. Mice were treated with decitabine starting at
day 1 (intraperitoneal injection, 6 days/week). For the
combination experiment, JNJ-585 was administered
subcutaneously at 1.5mg/kg once every other day.
Mice were sacrified after 3 weeks, when vehicle treated
5T33MM mice showed clear signs of morbidity (hind
limb paralysis). For the survival study, the treatment
schedule continued until each individual animal showed
signs of morbidity. Blood was collected for serum M-spike
determination and BM was isolated from hind legs to
quantify tumor burden as previously described [31].

Quantitative real-time PCR
After indicated time-points, cells were harvested and
RNA was extracted by the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Venlo,
The Netherlands). 1µg of total RNA was converted into
cDNA using the First-strand cDNA synthesis kit (VWR
International, Leuven, Belgium). Quantitative real-time
PCR was performed and analyzed as previously described
[29]. Primers for BRCA1, BRCA2 and RAD51 were
purchased at Thermo Scientific (Aalst, Belgium) and ABL1 primers were bought at Integrated DNA Technologies
(Leuven, Belgium). Primer sequences were as follows (5’3’): BRCA1: forward: ACCGTTGCTACCGAGTGTCTG;
reverse:
GTGATGTTCCTGAGATGCCTTTGC;
BRCA2: forward: AACCGTGTGGAAGTTGCGTA

Cells were plated at a density of 20.000/ml three
days before treatment. After indicated timepoints,
cytospins were made and stored at -20°C. The staining
protocol was as follows: cytospins were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde and washed with Tris-NaCl 0.05%
Triton-X100 (Merck). Next, cytospins were blocked
by 2% donkey serum and incubated overnight with the
primary antibodies; gamma-H2AX (20E3, #9718; Bioké),
RAD51 (ABE257; Millipore, Overijse, Belgium), 53BP1
(100-304; Novus Biologicals, Cambridge, UK). Next,
cytospins were washed and incubated for 1 hour with
donkey anti-rabbit-FITC (Jackson ImmunoResearch,
St-Martens-Latem, Belgium). After washing, cytospins
were mounted with Vectashield (Thermo Scientific)
containing
4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI).
Immunofluorescence was observed using a Nikon Eclipse
90i with a 60X objective magnification. Pictures were
taken using a Nikon DS-Ri1 and analyzed using the
ImageJ macro PZ-FociEZ. Briefly, DAPI was used to
define the nuclei. Next, foci were counted in the nuclei by
analyzing local maxima in fluorescence intensity. At least
