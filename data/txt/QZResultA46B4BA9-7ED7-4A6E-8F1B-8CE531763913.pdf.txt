ABSTRACT
Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase1 (PARP1) has been reported as a possible
target for chemotherapy in many cancer types. However, its action mechanisms and
clinical implications for gastric cancer survival are not yet fully understood. Here,
we investigated the effect of PARP1 inhibition in the growth of gastric cancer cells.
PARP1 inhibition by Olaparib or PARP1 siRNA could significantly attenuate growth and
colony formation of gastric cancer cells, and which were mediated through induction
of G2/M cell cycle arrest but not apoptosis. FOXO3A expression was induced by PARP1
inhibition, suggesting that FOXO3A might be one of downstream target of the PARP1
effect on gastric cancer cell growth. In addition, by performing tissue microarrays
on the 166 cases of gastric cancer patients, we could observe that the expression
status of PARP1 and FOXO3A were significantly associated with overall survival (OS)
and relapse-free survival (RFS). Strikingly, combined expression status of PARP1 and
FOXO3A showed better prediction for patient’s clinical outcomes. The patient group
with PARP1+/FOXO3A− expression had the worst prognosis while the patient group
with PARP1−/FOXO3A+ had the most favorable prognosis (OS: P = 6.0 × 10−9, RFS:
P = 2.2 × 10−8). In conclusion, we suggest that PARP1 and FOXO3A play critical roles
in gastric cancer progression, and might have therapeutic and/or diagnostic potential
in clinic.

INTRODUCTION

DNA repair response to DNA damage. PARP1 has been
known to play an important role in tumor development
in breast, ovary, and skin. Moreover, in most of breast
and ovarian cancer patients (about 80%), BRCA gene,
another DNA repair gene, is frequently mutated [2]. As a
consequence, the expression of PARP1 is up-regulated to
compensate the impaired DNA repair and the tumor cells
can survive and progress despite of their presence of DNA

Gastric cancer is one of the most common
malignancies with heterogeneous clinical outcome [1], but
its mechanisms leading to development and/or progression
of tumors remain unclear. PARP1 is a kind of polymerase
that can conjugate ADP from NAD+ to target proteins
such as histones and p53, to activate their functions in

damage [2–4]. Therefore, PARP1 is thought of as one of
therapeutic targets for the development of anti-cancer
treatments particularly for BRCA-mutated tumors, and a
variety of clinical trials are actively in progress [5–11].
However, recent studies have shown that the expression of
PARP1 protein can predict poorer prognosis regardless of
the existence of a BRCA mutations [12–16], although its
action mechanisms were not fully established. Recently,
PARP1 inhibition has been addressed to attenuate the
AKT-associated phosphorylation of forkhead box O
(FOXO) transcription factors [17, 18]. Of these FOXO
transcription factors, FOXO3A has been known as a
downstream target of serine/threonine protein kinase
B (PKB)/AKT. Phosphorylated FOXO3A by AKT
interacted with 14–3–3, resulting in faster degradation of
FOXO3A protein [19, 20]. When FOXO3A is activated
by inhibition of PI3K/AKT pathway, FOXO3A can
promote a wide range of cellular effects including cell
cycle arrest, induction of autophagy, sensitization to
chemotherapeutics, inhibition of metastasis and cell
differentiation, and apoptotic cell death [21, 22]. Indeed,
decreased expression of FOXO3A protein was associated
with tumor progression in various malignancies [23, 24].
Moreover, clinically used drugs like paclitaxel, imatinib,
and doxorubicin have shown therapeutic effects through
activation of FOXO3A and its targets [25]. Collectively,
PARP1 has been implicated in AKT activity, and the
FOXO3A phosphorylation by AKT causes its nuclear
exclusion and degradation, resulting in the suppression
of its transcriptional activity. Therefore, we hypothesized
that PARP1 and FOXO3A may interact together and play
critical roles in cancer progression. Moreover, to our
knowledge, the functional and clinical roles of PARP1 in
gastric cancer were not evaluated vigorously yet.
With respect to these, in the present study, we
aimed to investigate whether the expressions of PARP1
and FOXO3A have functional and clinical significance in
gastric cancer. By performing cell culture experiments,
we could observe that PARP1 inhibition significantly
attenuated gastric cancer cell growth, and which were
mediated through FOXO3A expression. Furthermore,
by performing tissue microarrays on the 166 cases of
gastric cancer patients, we demonstrated the prognostic
predictability of the expression status of PARP1 and
FOXO3A in gastric cancer. Our results may provide new
biological and clinical insights on the expressions of
PARP1 and FOXO3A in gastric cancer progression.

assays in the three human gastric cancer cell lines of
MKN28, MKN74, and NCI-N87. Treatment of Olaparib
showed significant suppression of cancer cell growth in
a dose- dependent manner (Figure 1A, top). After 72 h
incubation, IC50 of Olaparib was approximately 10 μM
in the three different cell lines. Cell counting assays
confirmed the time-dependent growth inhibition by
Olaparib treatment. The cell numbers after treatment with
Olaparib (2.5 μM) for 5 days were significantly lower than
those of the control cells (Figure 1A, middle). Colony
formation ability was also decreased by Olaparib treatment
(Figure 1A, bottom). In addition, to confirm the Olaparib
effect through PARP1 inhibition, we performed siRNAmediated knock-down experiments. Similar to Olaparib,
knock-down of PARP1 by siRNA significantly inhibited
the proliferation and colony formation of gastric cancer
cells (Figure 1B and 1C). However, treatment of Olaparib
in the PARP1 siRNA-transfected cells had no effect on
cell proliferation, which may indicate that the tumorsuppressive effect of Olaparib is through inactivation of
PARP1 (Figure 1D). Supporting this, a previous study
has demonstrated that PARP1/2 can be trapped into a
specific DNA sites causing direct cytotoxicity, suggesting
that PARP1 is essential in Olaparib-mediated tumor
suppression [26]. Therefore, we suggest that PARP1
inhibition by Olaparib can suppress the growth of human
gastric cancer cells.

PARP1 inhibition induce FOXO3A expression
and G2/M cell cycle arrest
As described in the Introduction, FOXO3A is
thought as one of putative effector downstream target
of PARP1. To evaluate this hypothesis, we examined
the effect of Olaparib on the expression of FOXO3A.
Western blot analysis demonstrated that the treatment
of Olaparib up-regulate FOXO3A expression in both
MKN28 and MKN74 cells in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 2A). In addition, when Olaparib was treated to
the FOXO3A knock-down cells, the Olaparib–mediated
growth inhibition was rescued, in part, by knock-down
of FOXO3A expression (Figure 2B). By contrast, knockdown of FOXO3A had no effect on the expression levels
of PARP1 mRNAs as well as proteins (Figure 2C, 2D).
These results consistently support that FOXO3A is one
of downstream target for the tumor-suppressive effect of
PARP1 inhibitor. Taken together, we suggest that tumorsuppressive effect of PARP1 inhibition is mediated, at
least in part, by FOXO3A activation, although further
studies might be required to address direct signaling
mechanisms between PARP1 and FOXO3A.
FOXO3A has been known to harbor multifaceted
cell functions including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis,
autophagy, and DNA repair [18, 27]. With this concern, we
next examined whether the effect of PARP1 inhibition on
cancer growth is mediated through activation of apoptotic

process. However, we could not observe the expression
of pro-apoptotic proteins such as cleaved form Caspase 3
or Bax by Olaparib treatment, which may suggest that the
Olaparib effect is not likely to be mediated by apoptotic
process (Figure 2E).

On the other hand, FOXO3A has been known
to trigger DNA repair in response to DNA damage by
activating cell cycle arrest [28–30]. With this concern,
we evaluated the effect of Olaparib in cell cycle system
by performing flow cytometry analysis. Treatment of

frequent in the patients with low tumor stage (P = 0.019)
and early gastric cancers (EGC) (P = 0.042). Thus, we
could suggest that PARP1 expression is associated with
aggressive phenotypes while FOXO3A expression is
associated with less aggressive phenotypes of gastric
cancers.
Univariate Cox regression analysis has revealed
several clinical features associated with shorter overall
survival (OS) and/or recurrence-free survival (RFS), which
included the preoperative serum levels of CEA and CA
19–9, tumor stage, lymph node metastasis, tumor invasion
classification, and venous invasion (Table 2). In addition,
the patient group with PARP1-positive tumors showed
significant shorter OS (Hazard Ratio HR; 2.19, 95% CI;
1.424–3.370, P < 0.001) and RFS (HR; 2.143, 95% CI;
1.406–3.265, P < 0.001). Vice versa, the patients with
FOXO3A-negative tumors showed shorter OS (HR; 3.893,
95% CI; 1.800–8.416, P < 0.001) and RFS (HR; 3.453,
95% CI; 1.673–7.127, P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier analyses
also revealed that these features (i.e., tumor stage, PARP1,
and FOXO3A) could predict prognostic outcomes of OS
and RFS, respectively (log-rank test, P < 0.001, Figure 3B).
In addition, to verify whether the prognostic
significance of the PARP1 and FOXO3A expressions
are independent each other, we performed KaplanMeier plot analyses for the subgroups classified based
on the expression status of PARP1 or FOXO3A,
respectively. We could observe that the expression status
of PARP1 predicted prognostic subgroups regardless
of their expression status of FOXO3A (Supplementary
Figure S3A, S3B). Likewise, the expression status of
FOXO3A could predict prognostic subgroups regardless
of their PARP1 expression status (Supplementary
Figure S3C, S3D). Consistently, multivariate analysis also
demonstrated that tumor stage and the expressions PARP1
and FOXO3A are independent prognostic indicators for OS
and RFS (Table 2). Therefore, we could suggest that the
PARP1 and FOXO3A expressions are significantly helpful
in predicting clinical outcomes of gastric cancer patients.
In Table 1, we have observed that the expressions
of PARP1 and FOXO3A proteins were significantly
associated with Lauren classification (P  = 0.035 and
P = 0.007, respectively). This may raise a possibility that the
Olaparib effect and/or the prognostic association of PARP1
and FOXO3A might be different among the subtypes of
Lauren classification. To address this issue, Kaplan-Meier
plot analyses were performed on the each of subtypes of
Lauren classification. Regardless of the subtype, we could
observe that PARP1-positive tumors have poorer OS and
RFS, while the FOXO3A-positive tumors have favorable
OS and RFS, respectively (Supplementary Figure S4).
In addition, we examined whether PARP1 inhibition has
different effects among the tumor types. Treatment of
Olaparib suppressed the growth of both diffuse type-derived
gastric cancer cells (i.e., MKN45 and KATOIII) as well as
intestinal type-derived cells (i.e., MKN28 and MKN74),

Olaparib (10 μM) significantly increased the percentage
of G2/M phase cells (21%, 23%, and 28%, at day 1, 2,
and 3, respectively) compared to those of control cells
(11%, 15%, and 19% at day 1, 2, and 3, respectively)
(Figure 2F). In addition, when FOXO3A expression was
knocked down by siRNAs, the percentage of cells with
G2/M arrest by Olaparib was significantly decreased from
45.8% to 29.8% (Figure 2G). These results consistently
suggest that PARP1 inhibition can induce G2/M cell
cycle arrest through activation of FOXO3A in gastric
cancer cells.
Previously, impaired BRCA1/2 genes have been
known to play an important role in conferring sensitivity
to PARP1 inhibitors, providing a well-accepted DNA
repair mechanism for the tumor-suppressive effect of
PARP1 inhibitors [3, 7, 31, 32]. Indeed, we have also
observed that knock-down of BRCA1 or BRCA2 could
sensitize Olaparib effect in MKN28 gastric cancer cells
(Supplementary Figure S1). This may imply that the
Olaparib treatment might be beneficial especially to the
BRCA-impaired gastric cancer patients, although further
studies might be required to delineate the functional roles
of BRCA genes to PARP1 and FOXO3A signaling.

PARP1 and FOXO3A expressions are associated
with clinical outcomes of gastric cancer patients
Confirming the biological relevance of the PARP1
and FOXO3A expression in gastric cancer cells, we
next evaluated the clinical significance of these genes
by performing tissue microarray assays in the 166
cases of gastric cancer patients. Immunohistochemical
staining indicated that the expressions of PARP1 and
FOXO3A were mainly localized to the nuclei of tumor
cells with weak expression in the cytoplasm, therefore,
we considered only the nuclear expression of PARP1
and FOXO3A in the analysis (Figure 3A). By performing
receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis for
patients’ survival, the cutoffs for positive immunostaining
of PARP1 and FOXO3A were determined to have the
highest likelihood ratio by selecting the cutoff values at
the highest and the lowest AUC (area under the curve),
respectively. Based on this analysis, PARP1-positive
group was determined with cutoff score 7, and FOXO3Apositive group was determined with cutoff score 6
(Supplementary Figure S2).
Clinico-pathological features and the expression
status of PARP1 and FOXO3A in the cohort of gastric
cancer patients were summarized in Table 1. Overall,
positive staining of PARP1 and FOXO3A proteins
were observed in 54% (89 out of 166) and 19% (32 out
of 166) in the cohort, respectively. PARP1 expression
was more frequent in the patients with higher tumor stage
(P < 0.001), the presence of tumor invasion (P < 0.001),
lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001), and venous invasion
(P = 0.017). In contrast, FOXO3A expression was more

suggesting that Olaparib is effective to suppress gastric
cancer growth independent of the subtypes of Lauren
classification (Supplementary Figure S5).
Next, to further verify the reliability and
significance of the prognostic values of PARP1 and
FOXO3A expression, we evaluated whether the intensity
scores of PARP1 or FOXO3A expression are correlated
with clinical outcomes. We measured the intensity of
immunohistochemical staining by Allred scores for
PARP1 (Mean Allred score ± standard error; 4.8 ± 0.2)
and FOXO3A (Mean Allred score ± standard error;
3.8  ± 0.2). The patients were sub-classified based on

the Allred scores for immunostaining intensities of
PARP1 (scores 0–3, 4–5, 6–8) or FOXO3A (scores 0–2,
3–6, 7–8), respectively. We found that the patient group
with higher scores of PARP1 showed poorer prognostic
outcomes of OS and RFS (P < 0.001, Figure 4A). Vice
versa, the patient group with higher scores of FOXO3A
showed more favorable clinical outcomes of OS and RFS
(P < 0.001, Figure 4B).
On the other hand, we could observe that the
PARP1-positive tumors frequently co-expressed FOXO3A
protein (23 out of 32, P = 0.021, Chi-square test, Table 1).
Likewise, the Allred scores of PARP1 and FOXO3A

showed significant positive correlation (Spearman’s

oncogenic expression of PARP1 may lead to concomitant
expression of FOXO3A as a compensatory mechanism
to suppress tumor progression. The tumors expressing
PARP1 without counter-balanced FOXO3A expression
(i.e., FOXO3A−/ PARP1+) might acquire uncontrolled
tumor growth provoking aggressive behavior.
Considering the functional link between PARP1
and FOXO3A, we next sought whether the combined
expression status of PARP1 and FOXO3A is better in
predicting clinical outcomes of gastric cancer patients.
Strikingly, when we stratified the patients based on the
combined expression status of PARP1 and FOXO3A, the
patient group with PARP1+/FOXO3A− (n = 66) showed
the worst prognosis while the patients with PARP−/
FOXO3A+ (n = 9) showed the most favorable prognosis of
OS (P = 6.0 × 10−9) and RFS (P = 2.2 × 10−8), respectively
(Figure 4C). The patent group with PARP+/FOXO3A+
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(n = 23) or the group with PARP1−/FOXO3A− (n = 23)
showed intermediate prognostic outcomes. These results
strongly suggest that the combined expression status of
PARP1 and FOXO3A rather than the expression of each
gene is better in predicting clinical outcomes of gastric
cancer patients.

DISCUSSION
In the present study, by performing combined
analysis of experimental and clinical data, we could
demonstrate that PARP1 and FOXO3A are functionally
linked and their expression levels are useful in predicting
clinical outcomes of gastric cancer patients. We
demonstrated that PARP1 inhibition induce G2/M cell
cycle arrest but not apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. In
addition, FOXO3A was suggested as a downstream target
for the tumor-suppressive effect of PARP1 inhibitor.
Indeed, there are a few reports that suggest a possible
link between PARP1 and FOXO3A. PARP1 is activated
within a few seconds after DNA damage to interact with
and PARsylate (add poly ADP ribose) IKK gamma, and
which promote cancer cell survival via NF- κB activation
[33]. PARP1 is recruited to DNA damage sites immediately

and forms interactions with a variety of nuclear DNA
repair-related proteins such as ATM and PIASy [34].
This suggests that PARP1 inhibition can inhibit NF-κB /
IKK-mediated pro-survival signaling in cancer cells. On
the other hand, it has been suggested that ubiquitination
by IKK beta can activate FOXO3A in vitro and in vivo
[35, 36]. Moreover, PARP1 inhibitors could attenuate AKT
phosphorylation via up-regulation of PHLPP1 [37]. AKT
is known to phosphorylate and degrade FOXO3 proteins
[19, 20]. These results imply that PARP1 can regulate
FOXO3A indirectly through NF-κB or AKT pathways,
playing important roles in tumor progression. Supporting
this hypothesis, our result successfully demonstrated that
FOXO3A is a possible downstream target of PARP1,
although further studies might be required to delineate the
precise molecular mechanisms on the PARP1 mediated
regulation of FOXO3A expression.
In addition, we have addressed clinical utilities of
PARP1 and FOXO3A expression for gastric cancer patients.
Survival analyses using tissue microarrays have successfully
demonstrated that the expression of PARP1 and FOXO3A
are independent prognostic indicators (OS and RFS) for
gastric cancer patients. We have also observed that PARP1
is frequently co-expressed with FOXO3A. According to this
discrepant result, we hypothesized that PARP1 expression
by oncogenic stimuli may induce FOXO3A expression
to attenuate cancer progression as a negative feedback.
Thus, if there is a defect in the compensatory expression
of FOXO3A, tumors may progress to harbor uncontrolled
aggressive behaviors. This raises an idea that induction
of FOXO3A in cancer cells could be a new therapeutic
strategy for gastric cancer treatment.
In conclusion, our results from cell culture
experiments and clinical data analysis consistently indicate
that the expression of PARP1 and FOXO3A play pivotal
roles in gastric cancer progression. Undoubtedly, PARP1
and FOXO3A can be new prognostic and therapeutic
targets for gastric cancer management.

previous study [38]. In this study, we included 166 cases
out of 177 cases of the previous gastric cancer specimens,
because the 11 cases were unsuitable for establishing
new tissue-microarrays. The patients underwent radical
gastrectomy between January 1997 and December 2005
at Chonbuk National University Hospital. The patients’
tumor stages (originally 50 cases for the each stage I, II, III,
and IV) were matched for the gender, age (± 2 years), and
calendar year of surgery- (± 2 years) based on the 6th edition
of AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging
system. Thereafter, we re-staged the 166 cases according to
the guidelines of the 7th edition of the AJCC staging system
and reviewed them according to the criteria of the World
Health Organization (WHO) classification. This study
was approved by Chonbuk National University Hospital’s
institutional review board. Informed consent was provided
according to the Declaration of Helsinki. The patients were
grouped according to their age, sex, preoperative serum
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19–9 levels,
tumor stage (I and II vs. III and IV), presence of lymph
node metastasis, presence of distant metastasis, presence of
venous invasion, histologic types according to the WHO
classification, histologic grade of tubular and papillary type
carcinomas, Lauren classifications, and tumor invasion
[early gastric carcinoma (EGC) vs. advanced gastric
carcinoma (AGC)]. The follow-up end point for patients
survival and recurrence-free survival was the date of the
last contact or the date of death through December 2011.

Western blotting
Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) and lysed with lysis buffer containing
protease and phosphatase inhibitors at 4°C for 30 min.
After centrifuging the lysates at 10,000 rpm for 10
min, equivalent amounts of each protein lysates were
resolved by 6%, 10%, or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred onto nitrocellulose
membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked for 1 h
in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris buffered saline
containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and then incubated for
1 h at room temperature or at 4°C overnight with primary
antibody diluted in TBST containing 3% BSA. After three
washes with TBST, membranes were incubated for 1 h with
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies
(1:3000 or 1:5000 dilutions) in TBST containing 1%
BSA. The immunoblots were visualized by an enhanced
chemiluminescence kit obtained from West-Q ECL
Platinum Solution obtained from GenDEPOT (Barker, TX).

MTT assay
Cells (2 × 103) were seeded in 96-well plates and
incubated at 37°C in a humidified incubator containing 5%
CO2 overnight. After treatment of reagents for indicated
time period, 20 μL MTT solution (5 mg/mL in phosphate
buffer) was added to each well and incubated for 2 h. The
blue crystalline precipitate in each well was dissolved in
DMSO (200 μL), and the visible absorbance at 595 nm of
each well was quantified using a microplate reader.

Tissue microarrays
Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffinembedded tissue-microarray blocks. One 3.0 mm core
per case was analyzed in a tissue-microarray. The tissue
sections were treated with a microwave antigen retrieval
procedure in pH 6.0 sodium citrate buffer for 20 minutes.
The following markers were used: PARP1 (H-300) (1:100,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and FOXO3A
(D19A7) (1:100, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA).
Two pathologists (Jang KY and Kim KM) have evaluated
the immunohistochemical staining of PARP1 and FOXO3A
in tissue microarrays by consensus without knowledge of
the clinicopathological information. The scoring for the
immunostaining for PARP1 and FOXO3A was performed
according to the Allred scoring system, which is generally
used for evaluation of nuclear expression [39, 40]. The
nuclear staining intensity was scored as 0 (no staining),
1 (weak staining), 2 (intermediate staining), or 3 (strong
staining). The area of staining was evaluated using the
following scores: 0, no staining cells; 1, 1% of the cells
stained positive; 2, 2–10% of the cells stained positive; 3,
11–33% of the cells stained positive; 4, 34–66% of the cells
stained positive; and 5, 66–100% of the cells stained positive.
Thereafter, the sum of intensity score and proportion score
was used for further analysis. The maximum sum score was
8 and the minimum sum score was zero.

Flow cytometry analysis
After treatment with the Olaparib or FOXO3A
siRNA, cells were harvested and washed twice with PBS
and fixed in 70% cold ethanol at 4°C overnight. Before
analysis, cells were washed twice with PBS, then resuspended with 400 μL PBS and treated with 100 μg/
mL RNase A (Sigma-Aldrich) and 50 μg/mL propidium
iodide (PI) (Sigma-Aldrich). After incubation for 30 min
at 37°C, the cells were subjected to DNA content analysis.
PI fluorescence was analyzed with FACS CantoII (Becton
Dickinson). Data from at least 10,000 cells were analyzed
with BD FACSDIVA 7.0 (Becton Dickinson). Cell cycle
distribution was calculated with ModiFit LT software.

Patients and specimens
Tissue microarray analysis was performed using
gastric adenocarcinoma specimens, which were used in a
