Abstract
Response to immunocytokine (IC) therapy is dependent on natural killer cells in murine neuroblastoma (NBL)
models. Furthermore, killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR)/KIR-ligand mismatch is associated with
improved outcome to autologous stem cell transplant for NBL. Additionally, clinical antitumor response to
monoclonal antibodies has been associated with specific polymorphic-FcgR alleles. Relapsed/refractory NBL
patients received the hu14.18-IL2 IC (humanized anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody linked to human IL2) in a
Children's Oncology Group phase II trial. In this report, these patients were genotyped for KIR, HLA, and FcR
alleles to determine whether KIR receptor–ligand mismatch or specific FcgR alleles were associated with
antitumor response. DNA samples were available for 38 of 39 patients enrolled: 24 were found to have autologous
KIR/KIR-ligand mismatch; 14 were matched. Of the 24 mismatched patients, 7 experienced either complete
response or improvement of their disease after IC therapy. There was no response or comparable improvement of
disease in patients who were matched. Thus KIR/KIR-ligand mismatch was associated with response/improvement to IC (P ¼ 0.03). There was a trend toward patients with the FcgR2A 131-H/H genotype showing a higher
response rate than other FcgR2A genotypes (P ¼ 0.06). These analyses indicate that response or improvement of
relapsed/refractory NBL patients after IC treatment is associated with autologous KIR/KIR-ligand mismatch,
consistent with a role for natural killer cells in this clinical response. Cancer Res; 70(23); 9554–61. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
The therapeutic role of natural killer (NK) cells in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) has been
well described. Ruggeri et al. (1) first reported on the
phenomenon of killer immunoglobulin-like receptor

(KIR)/KIR-ligand incompatibility and response to HLA-haploidentical HSCT, primarily in adult patients with acute
myeloid leukemia (AML). According to this analysis, a difference in HLA between the donor and recipient such that
the donor KIR receptors lack their cognate ligand in the
recipient results in improved leukemia control. Leung et al.
defined the principle of missing KIR ligand (designated here
as KIR/KIR-ligand mismatch), in which the HSCT recipient
lacks 1 or more HLA class-I ligands for the HSCT donor's
inhibitory KIRs (2). The KIR/KIR-ligand mismatch principle
posits that a difference in HLA between the donor and
recipient is not necessary for the benefit of KIR-HLA mismatching. They found that response of pediatric patients
with AML and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) to haploidentical HSCT could be predicted by the presence of this
KIR/KIR-ligand mismatch. An analysis of results of HLAidentical T cell–depleted sibling HSCT also revealed a benefit of KIR/KIR-ligand mismatch (3). KIR/KIR-ligand mismatch also extends to the autologous transplant setting.
Because the genes encoding for KIR and HLA class I KIR
ligands are inherited independently, it is possible for an
individual to be KIR/KIR-ligand mismatched with himself.
This scenario has been implicated as a favorable prognostic
factor in pediatric solid tumor patients following autologous
HSCT (ASCT) (4, 5). To date, there have been no reports
relating KIR/KIR-ligand mismatch and response of cancer

patients to immunotherapy or other treatments outside of
the HSCT or allogeneic NK cell infusion settings (6).
Several groups have investigated the role of fragment c
gamma receptor (FcgR) polymorphisms in the response of
cancer patients to rituximab, the chimeric anti-CD20 immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb). Some have
found an association between FcgR genotypes for higheraffinity FcgR alleles (FcgR2A-131 H/H and FcgR3A-158 V/V
genotypes) and response to rituximab-based therapy (7–9).
Association between FcgR genotype and response, for both
FcgR2A (found largely on neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages) and FcgR3A (found predominantly on NK cells) genotypes, has now been observed in cancer patients receiving other
mAbs (i.e., cetuximab and trastuzumab) as well (10, 11). Cheung
et al. (12) reported a correlation between FcgR2A polymorphism and response of neuroblastoma (NBL) patients to the antiGD2 murine IgG3 mAb, 3F8, plus granulocyte macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). In that study, progression-free survival was associated with the FcgR2A 131-R/R
alleles with the highest affinity for the 3F8 murine mAb.
GD2 is a disialoganglioside that is expressed on human
melanoma and NBL cells. Our recent Children's Oncology
Group (COG) phase III study has shown a significant improvement in overall survival and event-free survival for children
receiving an immunotherapy regimen of a chimeric anti-GD2
mAb (ch14.18-IL2) in combination with interleukin 2 (IL2) and
GM-CSF (13). The hu14.18-IL2 immunocytokine (IC) is a
fusion protein linking a molecule of IL2 to the carboxyl
terminus of each of the IgG1 heavy chains of the humanized
anti-GD2 mAb hu14.18. Tumor response to this IC in mice is
superior to the antitumor effects of comparable amounts of
anti-GD2 mAb infused together with comparable amounts of
IL2 (14). Antitumor effects in mice are primarily dependent on
NK cells in a murine model of NBL (15), with better responses
seen in the face of less-established disease (16). Furthermore,
augmented major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I
expression on murine NBL was associated with escape from
IC-mediated immunotherapy, implying a role for MHCinduced inhibition of NK cell function (17). Our recent phase
II COG trial has demonstrated antitumor activity for hu14.18IL2 in children with relapsed or refractory NBL (18).
In this study we evaluated the role of genotypes for KIR, KIR
ligands (HLA class I), and FcgR polymorphisms, in the
response of relapsed/refractory NBL patients to hu14.18-IL2
from our phase II trial (18).

Materials and Methods
Patients
Patients included in this analysis were eligible for and
enrolled on a COG phase II trial of hu14.18-IL2 (ANBL0322);
the clinical findings from that study have been reported separately (18). In brief, children (ages 1–21 years) with refractory or
recurrent NBL who met all study criteria were enrolled in 1 of 2
strata. Stratum 1 included 15 patients with measurable disease
(using standard radiographic criteria). Stratum 2 included 24
patients with disease that was not measurable by standard
imaging, but was evaluable by 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine

www.aacrjournals.org

(MIBG) scan and/or bone marrow histology. DNA samples were
available for 38 of the 39 enrolled patients. Informed consent
was obtained from Institutional Review Board–approved clinical protocols for all patients and/or their families.
Hu14.18-IL2
The clinical grade hu14.18-IL2 IC (EMD 273063) was generously provided by Merck Serono (Darmstadt, Germany) via
Dr. Toby Hecht, and the NCI-Biological Resources Branch
(Frederick, MD).
KIR/KIR-ligand genotyping
KIR genotyping was performed on patient DNA samples by
PCR sequence-specific primer technique (SSP Unitray assay;
Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA). KIR-ligand typing was
performed at low resolution on the same samples for HLA-B
and -C loci by reverse PCR-SSO methodology (LifeMatch
assay; Gen-Probe, Inc., Stamford, CT) and for high-resolution
HLA-C alleles by direct sequencing (AlleleSEQR assay; Abbott
Labs, Des Plaines, IL).
FcgR genotyping
Genotyping of FcgR2A 131-H/R (rs1801274) and FcgR3A
158-F/V (rs396991) polymorphisms were detected using pyrosequencing and TaqMan (19). Forward and reverse primers
are given in Table 1. PCR was performed in 25 mL reactions
using 2X PCR Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI) with
5 pmole forward, 0.5 pmole reverse, and 4.5 pmole of universal
biotin primer. The biotinylated PCR products were isolated
with Streptavidin-Sepharose HP (GE Healthcare, Piscataway,
NJ) and Sepharose beads. Allele quantification was performed
using a Pyrogold reagent kit (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP,
enzyme, and substrate mixtures) on the PSQ HS96A system
(Biotage AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Negative controls were
included on each plate. Plates were read on a PSQ HS
pyrosequencer using PSQ HS 96A SNP analysis software
version 2.1 in AQ mode.
To account for variation in the accuracy of FcgR3A 158-V/F
allele frequency determination, standard curves were generated by using synthesized biotin-labeled DNA oligonucleotides. Two oligonucleotides with either a "T'' or "G'' in the
mutation position (representing F and V alleles, respectively)
were combined in ratios (10:0, 9:1, . . .1:9, 0:10) and underwent
pyrosequencing. The expected and observed allele frequencies
were plotted. Backwards fitting was used to find the most
parsimonious fit.
Genotyping of FcgR3A 158-V/F mutation polymorphisms
was confirmed using TaqMan SNP genotyping assay
(C_25815666–10, Chr-1, DIS484) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions on a 7300 Real-Time PCR system
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). This TaqMan Assay
uses primers and probes that are predesigned and validated by
the company. The probes are conjugated with VIC-MGB or
FAM-MGB dyes, 1 to each allele. The amount of volume
required for each 25 mL reaction was TaqMan Genotyping
PCR Master Mix 12.5 mL and TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay
1 mL. The reaction conditions were as follows: 95 C for
10 minutes, and 50 cycles of 92 C for 15 seconds and 60 C

for 1 minute. Plates were read by the 7300 Real-Time PCR
system according to manufacturer protocols.
Statistical methods
Fisher's exact test was used to examine the association
between 2 categorical variables (i.e., KIR mismatch versus
response/improvement, genotype versus response/improvement, and KIR mismatch versus stratum). Chi-square test of
homogeneity was used to determine whether there was a
difference in distributions of KIR mismatch/match and FcgR
genotypes between our study population and others’ (5, 12).
For the analysis of the association between genotype and
response/improvement, FcgR2A were dichotomized into H/H
versus H/R or R/R, and FcgR3A into V/V versus V/F or F/F.
Statistical significance was defined as a 2-tailed P < 0.05, and a
P value from 0.05 to 0.1 was regarded as marginally statistically
significant. Because of the exploratory nature of this study, no
multiplicity adjustment was made for significance tests.

Results
KIR/KIR-ligand genotyping
The 4 inhibitory KIR genes (KIR2DL1, KIR2DL2, KIR2DL3,
KIR3DL1) evaluated in this study and their corresponding
KIR-ligands (HLA-C1, HLA-C2, or HLA-Bw4) are listed in
Table 2. KIR/KIR-ligand mismatch was defined as absence
of 1 or more HLA alleles known to be ligands for the inhibitory
KIR genes present, using previously published criteria (2). The
specific KIR and KIR-ligand genotypes for all 38 patients (with
DNA available) are shown in Table 3. Two patients showed
evidence for only 2 of the 3 inhibitory KIR gene specificities
evaluated in this study; the other 36 patients had all 3
inhibitory KIR gene specificities present. KIR/KIR-ligand mismatch was observed in 24 of 38 patients whereas in 14 of 38
patients these were matched (Table 4). This ratio of matched
to mismatched genotypes, when using this set of KIR genes
and KIR ligand genes, is not significantly different (P ¼ 0.93)

from that reported for the set of NBL patients undergoing
ASCT reported by Venstrom et al. (5).
FcgR genotyping
FcgR genotyping data for all patients tested are also
included in Table 3, and is summarized in Table 4. The
genotype distributions for both FcgR2A and FcgR3A were
in Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE). The FcgR2A 131-H/R
genotype was more prevalent (16 of 38 patients) than the H/H
genotype (10 of 38) and R/R genotype (12 of 38) (P value of
HWE is 0.34). Two of 38 patients (patients 8 and 35) were
excluded from the analysis of FcgR3A genotyping (and relevant analyses of associations) due to discrepant results of
pyrosequencing and TaqMan; both patients were F/V by
pyrosequencing and F/F by TaqMan. If patients 8 and 35
are included in the analyses as either F/F or F/V the relevant
statistical analyses, as do their conclusions, remain virtually
unchanged. The FcgR3A 158-F/F and F/V genotypes were
equally prevalent (both present in 17 of 36 patients) in this
patient population, whereas the V/V genotype was present in
only 2 patients (P of HWE ¼ 0.39). These distributions of the
FcgR2A (P ¼ 0.5) and FcgR3A (P ¼ 0.92) genotypes were not
significantly different from those reported for the population
of NBL patients reported by Cheung et al. (12).
Clinical response to hu14.18-IL2
The clinical details for this phase II trial have been reported
separately (18). Individual response and stratum data are
included in Table 3. For the purposes of the associations
examined in this report, 5 patients (2, 10, 22, 27, and 29) showed
a complete response (CR). These CRs lasted 13, 9, 20, 30, and >35
months, respectively. Two additional patients (3 and 22) were
scored as showing stable disease, but showed clear clinical signs
of improvement (clearing of all marrow disease and MIBG
improvement not quite meeting partial response criteria for
patient 3, and resolution of all MIBG-detectable disease with
near clearing of marrow disease for patient 22). All 5 patients
with CR and the 2 with "improved'' status were in stratum 2.

the 24 stratum 2 patients, there was a trend (that did not meet
criteria for statistical significance) toward a similar association of mismatch and response/improvement (7 of 7) versus
nonimprovement (11 of 17) (P ¼ 0.13, Table 5, Mismatch

In addition, there appeared to be a greater fraction of KIR/

statistical significance (P ¼ 0.08, Table 5, Mismatch versus

FcgR. The FcgR2A genotype data analysis for association
with response suggests, with marginal statistical significance,
that patients with the H/H genotype showed a higher likelihood of response/improvement (Table 6, P ¼ 0.06). In
contrast, there was no suggestion of association between

FcgR3A genotype and response/improvement to IC (P ¼
1.0, Table 7).

Discussion
NK-mediated lysis of NBL cell lines in vitro is augmented by
the addition of IL2 (20), especially when using NK cells from
patients receiving IL2 (21). Furthermore, NK-mediated antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) is augmented when the NK cells are obtained following in vivo
administration of IL2 (22). Initial studies with chimeric
anti-GD2 antibody, ch14.18, fused with human IL-2
(ch14.18-IL2), demonstrated NK-mediated regression of local
and disseminated murine NBL (15). Similar results were later
seen in murine NBL models with administration of hu14.18IL2 (16). As escape from this NK-mediated response to

hu14.18-IL2 was associated with upregulation of MHC class I
on NBL cells (known to induce inhibitory responses via Ly-49
receptors on murine NK cells) (17), we hypothesized that
similar relationships may influence the clinical response
to hu14.18-IL2. To test this hypothesis, it was first necessary
to identify a population that shows some clinical response to
hu14.18-IL2.
Our recently reported phase II study of hu14.18-IL2 in
patients with relapsed or refractory NBL demonstrated CR
or improved disease in 7 of 38 treated patients (18). All 7 of
these responding/improved patients were in stratum 2 (evaluable but not radiographically measurable disease), consistent
with our preclinical data showing greater detection of antitumor activity in animals with less tumor burden (16).
Although the role of KIRs has been evaluated in the setting
of autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantation and
infusions of allogeneic NK cells following lymphodepletive
chemotherapy (1–6), it has not been studied for association
with antitumor response in patients receiving only cytokines
or mAbs for immunotherapy. We hypothesized that children
with recurrent/refractory NBL, who received the hu14.18-IL2
in our phase II COG study, would demonstrate greater
response to IC in the presence of KIR/KIR-ligand mismatch.
When the data were analyzed for all 38 patients who had
provided DNA samples, 24 of them were found to be KIR/KIRligand mismatched, and all 7 of the responding or improved
patients were found in this group (P ¼ 0.03, Table 5, Mismatch
versus response/improvement of all patients). Because the
KIR/KIR-ligand interaction is primarily a mechanism controlling NK cell activity, this result is consistent with the murine
data showing that the anti-NBL effect of ch14.18-IL2 and
hu14.18-IL2 is primarily mediated by NK cells (15–17). Even
prior to the administration of hu14.18-IL2, there is a trend
toward greater KIR/KIR-ligand mismatch in the patients who

enter stratum 2 than in stratum 1 (P ¼ 0.08, Table 5, Mismatch
versus both strata 1 and 2). If additional data validate this
trend, it would suggest that a child's endogenous KIR/KIRligand status might play a role in the clinical pattern of relapse;
namely, the patients who are KIR-mismatched may be less
likely to relapse with "bulky'' (measurable/stratum 1) disease.
Similarly, if additional data validate the trend (P ¼ 0.13) that
KIR/KIR-ligand mismatch is associated with response within
Stratum 2 patients (Table 5, Mismatch versus response/
improvement for patients in stratum 2 only); the presence
of Stratum 2 status and KIR/KIR-ligand mismatch might be
considered as eligibility criteria for future treatment with
hu14.18-IL2 for children with relapsed or refractory NBL.
The roles of the activating Fc receptors involved in ADCC,
FcgR2A ,and FcgR3A, have been demonstrated in response to
rituximab, cetuximab, and trastuzumab (7–11). Cheung et al.
(12) have found an association between FcgR2A polymorphism
and outcome of NBL patients receiving the murine anti-GD2
IgG3 antibody, 3F8, but only when given in combination with
GM-CSF. This result suggests that when neutrophils or monocytes/macrophages are activated with GM-CSF, they facilitate
clinically meaningful ADCC via the high-affinity alleles of
FcgR2A for 3F8 (12). This response was unlikely to be NKmediated, as FcgR2A is not present on NK cells. As preclinical
data and our current results (Table 5, Mismatch versus
response/improvement of all patients) suggest that NK cells
are playing a role in the clinical response to hu14.18-IL2 in NBL
patients, we initially hypothesized that the response/improvement of NBL patients to the IgG1-containing IC might be
associated with the presence of the high-affinity FcgR3A
158-V/V genotype (influencing NK function), and not the
high-affinity FcgR2A 131-H/H genotype reflecting neutrophil
and macrophage ADCC. However, we found that patients with
the H/H genotype for FcgR2A did show a trend toward higher

response rate, which was of marginal statistical significance
(P ¼ 0.06). Clearly these comparisons are underpowered. Even
so, the near significant association of improvement with the
FcgR2A 131-H/H genotype would be consistent with the activation of some neutrophil or macrophage-mediated ADCC. IL2
treatment is known to induce release of GM-CSF by IL2
responsive cells (23), and it is possible that activation of ADCC
by these FcgR2A-bearing cells is resulting from GM-CSF production stimulated by the IL2 component of the IC.
Given the infrequency of the FcgR3A 158-V/V genotype in
the general population, with only 2 of our 36 genotyped
patients identified with this genotype, it is no surprise that
a statistically significant association was not seen between
this genotype and response. However, this lack of statistical
significance cannot be equated with the lack of proof in this
study due to inadequate sample size with a highly unbalanced
design. Even so, it may be surprising that none of the 7
patients who showed response or improvement had this V/
V genotype. This very preliminary result would suggest that
there may not be an association between the V/V genotype
and improvement in this population when treated with
hu14.18-IL2. The lack of an association with FcgR3A alleles
and response (even if confirmed in a larger sample) does not
necessarily indicate that NK cells are uninvolved in mediating
ADCC. Rather, it could suggest that there is no advantage for
high versus lower affinity FcgR3A alleles in this setting of ICmediated ADCC. We have recently shown that some NK cells
can use their IL2 receptors to recognize the membrane-bound
IL2 on tumor cells coated with tumor-reactive IC (Gubbels
et al., submitted manuscript). This results in NK adhesion to
the IC-coated tumor cells, activation of an immune synapse,
and subsequent tumor cell destruction, apparently without
requiring Fc receptors (Buhtoiarov et al., submitted manuscript). In the face of this IL2 receptor–facilitated IC-mediated
killing, high-affinity FcgRs on the NK cells might not be
needed. In other words, although high-affinity FcgRs play
an important role in the clinical effects of FcR-mediated
ADCC using conventional mAbs, they might not be as important for NK mediated antitumor effects of ICs. This might
enable NK cells with the F/V or F/F FcgR3A alleles to mediate
comparable in vivo destruction to that mediated by cells with
V/V alleles. Clearly, these are speculative hypotheses as the

results were obtained from a limited number of subjects and
must be extended to a larger population to draw firmer
conclusions.
The COG plans to perform a follow-up study of hu14.18-IL2
in stratum 2 patients, to further characterize these responses.
That follow-up study should provide additional data to better
test the associations analyzed in this report. Furthermore, the
KIR/KIR-ligand mismatch might also be further tested by
genotyping of subjects participating in larger trials of clinically
effective mAbs that mediate ADCC, such as ch14.18, rituximab, cetuximab, and trastuzumab (7–11).
In summary, we conclude that response or improvement of
relapsed or refractory NBL patients following treatment with
hu14.18-IL2 is associated with KIR receptor–ligand mismatch,
consistent with a role for NK cells in this clinical response.
Although there appears to be no statistical significance of
FcgR genotype in response of NBL patients to IC in this COG
trial, further clinical and in vitro data are needed to better
clarify the potential roles of FcgR2A and FcgR3A in these
clinical responses.
