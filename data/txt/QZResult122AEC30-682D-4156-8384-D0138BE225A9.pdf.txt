Abstract
Metastatic spread of melanoma to the central nervous system (CNS) is a common and devastating
manifestation of disease progression, which, despite its clinical importance, remains poorly understood with
respect to underlying molecular mechanisms. Using a recently developed preclinical model of spontaneous
melanoma CNS metastasis, we have identiﬁed alterations in expression of endothelin receptor B (EDNRB) as a
potential factor that inﬂuences brain metastatic potential. Induced overexpression of this gene mediated
enhanced overall metastatic disease, and resulted in an increased incidence of spontaneous CNS metastases.
In contrast, the overexpression of other highlighted genes, such as BCL2A1, did not affect the incidence of CNS
metastases but nevertheless appears to facilitate intracranial tumor growth. The prometastatic effect in the CNS
associated with EDNRB appears to be mediated by the interaction with its ligands resulting in enhanced tumor
cell proliferation and thus intracranial melanoma growth. That EDNRB contributes to melanoma metastasis is
underscored by the fact that its therapeutic inhibition by the EDNRB-speciﬁc inhibitor A192621 translated into
improved outcomes when treating mice with either visceral metastases or intracranial tumors. The identiﬁcation
of an inﬂuential role of EDNRB in CNS melanoma spontaneous metastasis may provide both a target for
therapeutic intervention as well as a potential prognostic marker for patients having an increased predisposition
for incidence of CNS melanoma metastases. Cancer Res; 72(19); 4909–19. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Melanoma metastasis to the central nervous system
(CNS) is a common end-stage manifestation of malignant
progression for this type of cancer and remains a signiﬁcant
clinical treatment challenge. The incidence of brain metastases in melanoma patients, which is among the highest in
all tumor types, highlights a particular predilection of
metastasis to the brain by this tumor type (1), and is
invariably associated with poor prognosis. Lack of efﬁcacy,
likely in large part, occurs as a result of poor penetration of
these agents across the blood-brain barrier (BBB; 2, 3). The
recent success achieved with vemurafenib for melanoma
represents an important step toward improving the prognosis of patients (4, 5) and highlights the importance of

identifying molecules that are speciﬁcally relevant to this
cancer type that can in turn be used as effective targets for
novel therapies.
Ironically, however, as the ability to treat systemic visceral
metastatic disease in other cancer improves, the problem of CNS
metastatic disease is becoming more common (6–9). Indeed, the
importance of CNS as sanctuary site for cancers such as metastatic melanoma is underlined by the fact that even when
patients achieve long-term remission, 50% of them will experience CNS metastases as the only site of relapse (10–12).
With the aim of studying the biology and treatment of
melanoma brain metastasis, we recently reported the generation of stable variant human melanoma cell lines capable of
metastasizing spontaneously to CNS from a primary orthotopic tumor transplant (13). This model of spontaneous metastasis presents a rigorous challenge to tumor cell spread in a
manner that closely recapitulates the multistep dissemination
and clinical presentation of melanoma metastasis. Here we
report our efforts using these unique brain metastatic lines
(named 131/4-5B1 and 131/4-5B2) to elucidate molecular
alterations that appear to contribute to the progression to the
brain metastatic phenotype, one of which is endothelin receptor-B (EDNRB).

develop the visceral metastatic variant 113/6-4L as well as the
brain metastatic variants 131/4-5B1 and 131/4-5B2. The methodology used is outlined in Supplementary Fig. S1. All variants
were karyotyped and then Illumina genotyped to ensure lack of
mouse genomic contamination.
Microarray analysis
The gene expression proﬁles of cell lines were assessed on
the HEEBO human genome set (44K Agilent-like oligo set from
Invitrogen). Both brain metastatic cell lines (131/4-5B1 and
131/4-5B2) were compared with the poorly metastatic parental
cell line WM239A and a derived highly metastatic variant 113/
6-4L. Additional comparisons examined the expression proﬁle
of 113/6-4L relative to WM239A using 2 different passage
numbers, incorporating a dye swap.
Conﬁrmation of clinical and functional relevance
The expression of EDNRB and BCL2A1 in brain metastatic
variants and in clinical samples was conducted as described in
"Supplementary Materials and Methods."
Effect of gene upregulation on intracranial melanoma
growth
EDNRB or BCL2A1 cDNA was transduced into the 113/6-4L
parental cell line and implanted intracranially. To this end,
25,000 6-4EDNRB cells were delivered using stereostatic set up.
Control mice were implanted with the 113/6-4L-cell line
transduced with the empty vector (6-4vector). Mice were
monitored regularly and sacriﬁced when they developed signs
of distress (e.g., lethargy, scrufﬁness, body weight loss >12%).
Brains were sectioned and immunostained with HMB45 antibody to detect the presence of intracranial tumors. The crosssectional area of these tumors was measured using Axiovision
4.6 software. Cross-sections from 6-4EDNRB and 6-4 vector
were further immunostained for Ki67.
Effect of EDNRB inhibitor A192621 on lung metastases
and intracranial melanoma growth
Mice were implanted orthotopically with 131/4-5B2 melanoma cell line and primary tumors resected, as described
above. Mice were treated with either 60 mg/Kg A192621 or
vehicle by daily gavage for over 5 months (n ¼ 4). Treatment
was initiated 1 week postprimary tumor resection. At the end
of treatment period, mice were sacriﬁced and lungs excised,
ﬁxed, sectioned, and immunostained for HMB45 to detect the
presence of melanoma metastases.
To examine whether A192621 could have an effect on
intracranial melanoma tumors, mice were implanted as
above with 131/4-5B2 melanoma cells. Mice were treated
with 60 mg/Kg A192621 or vehicle. Treatment was initiated 4
days posttumor cell inoculation and continued until mice
began to show signs of distress as above. Brains were
sectioned and immunostained for HMB45. To examine
whether cyclosporin A could improve the penetration of
A192621 across the BBB, mice were treated by means of daily
gavage with either cyclosporin A (50 mg/Kg daily gavage) þ
A192621 vehicle or cyclosporin A (50 mg/Kg) þ A192621
(60 mg/Kg). Mice were treated for 2 weeks, brains were

excised, immunostained, and cross-sectional area measured
as above.

Results
Gene expression proﬁle changes in the spontaneous
brain-metastasizing variant cell lines
Microarray analysis was conducted to discern the nature of
possible molecules/pathways that underlie the alterations
responsible for the unique spontaneous brain metastatic phenotype of the 131/45B1 and 131/4-5B2 variant cell lines. Our
model allows the examination of the sequence of transcriptional changes that occurs in the transition from poorly
metastatic (i.e., WM239A parental cell line) to highly visceral
metastatic variant (i.e., the 113/6-4L variant that metastasizes to sites such as lung and liver) and ﬁnally to the brain
metastatic phenotype (i.e., the 131/4-5B1 and 131/4-5B2 variant cell lines). The lineage relationship of these cell lines is
shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. The nature of expression
changes noted in metastatic variants relative to poorly metastatic variants is shown in Table 1.
Relevant to the brain metastatic phenotype, our analysis
shows that the 131/4-5B1 and 131/4-5B2 cell lines have
similar expression proﬁles to one another but these are
different from those of their visceral (lung/liver) metastatic
parental cell line 113/6-4L, when using 113/6-4L or WM239
as a baseline for all comparisons (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
The brain metastatic cell lines showed enrichment of a
number of genes involved in cell development, neurogenesis,
locomotion, and cell localization. Analysis of genes present
in the comparison of 131/4-5B1 or 131/4-5B2 versus 113/64L, but not in the comparison of 11/6-4L versus WM239,
showed differential expression in 87 genes in the variant
brain metastatic cell lines (44 genes upregulated and 43
downregulated). Among these, 28 showed an upregulation of
1.5-fold or more and 24 showed a downregulation greater
than or equal to 0.67-fold (Table 2). Quantitative real-time
PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to conﬁrm the changes in gene
expression noted by microarray analysis. To this end, multiple passages of brain metastatic variants and parental
highly metastatic (visceral metastatic only) 113/6-4L were
compared. To ensure that alterations in gene expression
were caused by the therapeutic regimen used to treat the
mice from which the brain metastatic variants were derived
(i.e., metronomic chemotherapy using the combination of
vinblastine and cyclophosphamide), 131/4-5B1 and 131/45B2 were further compared with other visceral metastatic
variants (named 113/7-4L and 113/8-2L). Both 7-4L and 8-2L
were derived from mice that had been similarly implanted
with 113/6-4L and exposed to the same therapeutic regimen.
Some genes such as dopachrome tautomerase (DCT) and
candidate of metastasis (COM1) showed the expected upregulation in 131/4-5B1 and B2 in comparison with to 113/64L, but were also upregulated in the visceral metastatic 113/
7-4L and 113/8-2L cell lines. Genes chosen for further studies
were those that showed signiﬁcant upregulation in both 131/
4-5B1 and B2 versus the 113/6-4L cells (but not in 113/7-4L
and 113/8-2L). These genes included, among others, EDNRB
and BCL2A1 (Supplementary Fig. S2B and S2C and Fig. S3).

Below we describe the efforts undertaken to examine the
relevance of these genes to CNS metastatic disease.
EDNRB is expressed in clinical samples of melanoma CNS
metastases
To discern the possible relevance of EDNRB to the clinical
brain metastatic phenotype, we used real-time PCR (RTPCR) to examine whether this gene was expressed in a panel
of 17 clinical samples of CNS melanoma metastases (Fig. 1A).
Eleven of the samples showed strong EDNRB expression. The

remaining samples showed lower levels of expression. In
contrast, the expression of the other endothelin receptor
subtype, EDNRA, was not upregulated in the brain metastatic cell lines and showed signiﬁcantly lower levels of
expression in the panel of clinical samples of brain metastases when compared with EDNRB (Supplementary Fig. S4A
and S4B, respectively).
We conducted immunohistochemistry on independent clinical samples to compare the levels of EDNRB expression in
melanoma brain metastases relative to visceral metastases

EDNRB overexpression enhances metastatic potential
To examine the signiﬁcance of EDNRB upregulation to the
process of spontaneous metastatic disease (both visceral and
CNS), we made use of lentiviral vectors to induce stable
alterations of EDNRB expression in the visceral metastatic
113/6-4L cell line (Supplementary Fig. S5A–S5C). We used
these cells to examine the effect of EDNRB upregulation on
the spontaneous metastasis. The induced overexpression
of this gene resulted in enhanced metastatic potential, leading

was characterized symptomatically as breathing difﬁculty and
that resulted both in a signiﬁcantly shorter median survival
of mice that had been implanted orthotopically with the 64EDNRB cells (84.5 days) compared with control cells transduced with empty lentiviral vector (6-4vector; 134.5 days;
Logrank test P < 0.05; Fig. 2A) and a higher hazard ratio (HR
¼ 3.26). More pertinent with respect to the role of this gene to
its contribution to spontaneous CNS metastatic disease, we
noted a higher incidence of brain metastases in the mice

(Fisher's exact test P < 0.05). Importantly, this enhanced
incidence of metastatic disease was limited to the CNS because
other organs such as liver and kidney failed to show any
alterations in frequency of metastatic disease between EDNRB
overexpressing cells and the vector control (Fig. 2B). Overall,
these results suggest that EDNRB upregulation contributes to a
prometastatic role, which can ultimately result in increased
melanoma seeding/colonization of the CNS.

expressing cell line, we examined whether EDNRB could
facilitate preferential melanoma proliferation within the CNS
microenvironment. We postulated that this effect may be the
result of interaction of EDNRB with its ligands (endothelin-1,
-2, or -3) to induce melanoma proliferation. In this regard, high
levels of expression of endothelin-3 (ET3) have been noted in
the brain (14). We also noted expression of ET3 and lower
expression of ET1 in severe combined immunodeﬁcient mice
(SCID) mice (Supplementary Fig. S6A). In this case, expression
of ET3 was primarily associated with neurons in the cortex and
cerebellum (Supplementary Fig. S6B–S6D). Thus, it is possible
that interaction of EDNRB with ET3 may lead to enhanced
tumor growth in organs such as the brain in which these

molecules are expressed, and thus lead to an increased incidence of CNS metastases. Indeed, as would be expected by the
higher levels of EDNRB expression, both brain metastatic
cells lines showed greater proliferation in the presence of ET3
(Fig. 3A) compared with the visceral metastatic variant 113/
6-4L cell line. Moreover, this enhanced proliferation could be
blocked by the addition of the EDNRB-speciﬁc inhibitor
A192621. In the absence of ET3, A192621 failed to induce a
signiﬁcant inhibitory effect (Supplementary Fig. S7A).
We have previously reported that the brain metastatic cell
lines 131/4-5B1 and B2, when compared with visceral metastatic parental variants, display enhanced proliferation in the
presence of brain-conditioned media (CM; 13). We asked
whether this effect could be the result of interaction of EDNRB
with endothelins present in the microenvironment of the CNS.
Our results show that the enhanced proliferation mediated by
brain-CM could be blocked by the EDNRB inhibitor A192621
(Fig. 3B), implicating the endothelins as major drivers of CNSstimulated proliferation in the brain metastatic melanoma cell
lines. However, because the inhibitory effect mediated by
A192621 may be inﬂuenced by mechanisms other than EDNRB
inhibition (15), we examined whether this effect could also be
achieved through genetically mediated downregulation of
EDNRB. Stable knockdown of this gene was achieved by shRNA
and a number of clones were chosen that showed signiﬁcant
knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S5C). When cultured in the
presence of brain-CM, selected knockdown cell lines for B2
showed decreased proliferative potential when compared with
control cell lines (respective 131/4-5B2 cell line transduced
with empty vector PLKO (plasmid lentiviral cloning vector);
Supplementary Fig. S7B and S7C).
Collectively these results implicated the EDNRB axis as a
potentially relevant factor that facilitates melanoma cell
growth within the CNS. To directly examine whether overexpression of this molecule could indeed lead to preferential
growth of EDNRB overexpressing cells once they have reached
the CNS, we implanted EDNRB overexpressing cells (64EDNRB) intracranially in SCID mice. Our results showed that
6-4EDNRB cells implanted intracranially gave rise to larger
tumors than those associated with 6-4 vector cells (Fig. 3C–E,
Supplementary Fig. S7D). These larger tumors also showed
increased levels of cell proliferation as denoted by the presence
of higher levels of Ki67-positive cells (Fig. 3F). In contrast, the
overexpression of EDNRB failed to enhance tumor cell proliferation in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S7E) and in the case of
orthotopic (subdermal) implantation this overexpression led
to a slight delay in subdermal tumor growth (data not shown).
The relevance of EDNRB was further examined by inducing
stable knockdown in the brain metastatic variant 131/4-5B2.
When implanted intracranially, the knockdown cell lines (B2hp2136 and B2-hp3119) generated signiﬁcantly smaller tumors
when compared with the empty vector control (B2 PLKO; Fig.
3G and H).

whether this inhibitor could also affect visceral metastases or
intracranial melanoma growth in vivo. Using the 131/4-5B2

daily treatment with A192621 (60 mg/kg, daily gavage) mediated signiﬁcant suppression of visceral metastatic disease
leading to both a longer median survival (125 days for
A192621 treated mice versus 84 for vehicle control; P < 0.05)
as well as an improved HR (0.28; Fig. 4A). Despite the efﬁcacy
noted in this setting, A192621 given in the same fashion
(60 m/Kg daily gavage for 1 month) failed to induce an
inhibitory effect against intracranially implanted 131/4-5B2

BCL2a1 expression enhances tumor cell survival in CNS
leading to intracranial tumor growth
The ability of EDNRB overexpression to mediate increases in
spontaneous CNS metastasis is contrasted with that of other
genes highlighted by our expression proﬁle analysis. In the
case of BCL2A1 for instance, its expression was noted to be
signiﬁcantly higher in the brain metastatic variants (compared
with parental 113/6-4L; Supplementary Fig. S2C) and was also
noted in a majority of clinical samples of CNS melanoma
metastases (13 out of 17 samples showed moderate levels of
expression; Fig. 5A). Although a number of studies have noted
speciﬁc upregulation of BCL2A1 in melanomas (20), no direct
correlation has been established between expression and metastatic potential. Our results show that the induced overexpression of BCL2A1 in the 113/6-4L cell line mediates a robust
spontaneous visceral prometastatic effect which nevertheless
did not translate into a signiﬁcant increase in incidence of
spontaneous CNS metastases or in the distribution of metastases in other organs (Fig. 5B and C). Nevertheless, we found
that intracranially implanted 6-4BCL2A1 cells gave rise to larger
tumors than those from similarly implanted 6-4vector cells
(Fig. 5D–F; Supplementary Fig. S7D). This suggests that the
overexpression of BCL2A1 does not inﬂuence the dissemination of tumor cells from the primary tumor or from lung
metastases, but that it may exert a postextravasation metastatic effect once the melanoma cells have reached the CNS (i.e.,
colonization of secondary site). Given the antiapoptotic function ascribed to BCL2A1 (21, 22), it is possible that its overexpression may enhance tumor cell survival leading to larger

efﬁcacy might be ascribed to the inability of A192621 to cross
the BBB (17); a limitation that is common to most chemotherapeutic agents presently available.
The impermeability associated with BBB is the result of
multiple factors; included among these is the presence of
numerous efﬂux pumps (18). Previous studies have shown
that inhibition of the efﬂux pump P-glycoprotein (PGP) can
result in increased levels of drugs within the brain parenchyma
(19). Therefore, we examined whether a combination of
A192621 with a known PGP-inhibitor, such as cyclosporin A,
could mediate improved penetration and permeability of the
EDNRB inhibitor and thus result in an improved therapeutic
effect against intracranial melanomas. In vitro examination
showed that A192621 did not act synergistically with cyclosporin A to induce increased cellular toxicity against 131/4-5B2
melanoma cells (i.e., similar toxicity was noted for cyclosporin
A alone and its combination with A192621; Supplementary Fig.
S7F). This combination did result in increase levels of toxicity
in mice (indicated by loss of weight and lethargy). As such,
treatment could only be conducted for 2 weeks. Nevertheless,
at the end of this treatment period we noted that mice treated
with the combination of A192621 þ cyclosporin A had smaller
intracranial melanomas compared with mice treated with
cyclosporin A alone (Fig. 4C–E; t test P < 0.05). These results
highlight both the relevance of EDNRB axis to melanoma brain
metastases and the involvement of PGP, likely among other
factors, in preventing effective delivery of the EDNRB inhibitor
A192621 to the brain parenchyma.

intracranial melanomas (as well as higher visceral metastatic
potential). Indeed, we have found that the brain metastatic
variants show enhanced resistance to inhibitory/proapoptotic
agents such as TNF-a and that this resistance can be attributed
in part to the overexpression of BCL2A1 (Supplementary Fig.
S8A and S8B). Within the context of the CNS, such an effect
could mediate resistance to the inhibitory activity that activated microglial cells (through the release of factors such as
TNF-a) appear to play against intracranial tumors (23).

Genes Relevant to Spontaneous CNS Melanoma Metastasis

targeted therapeutic approaches can be facilitated by ﬁrst
improving our understanding of the molecular and cellular
mediators, and pathways, that are relevant to the brain metastatic phenotype (24, 25). Thus far, knowledge of the factors that
contribute to the prevalence of melanoma CNS metastases is
meager. In this regard, it is unclear whether the genes that
regulate visceral metastases are also relevant to brain metastatic
disease or whether spread to CNS is mediated by brain-speciﬁc
mechanisms. Resolution of this important issue can have
an inﬂuential role on the identiﬁcation of relevant therapeutic
targets as well as the design of treatment strategies (preventive
vs. interventive; 1). Previous work suggests that in breast
cancer, a number of genes previously shown to be relevant to
this and various other cancer types can mediate metastatic
spread to both CNS and lungs (26). It is possible that in a similar
manner the extremely high incidence of CNS metastases in
malignant melanoma may be reﬂective of alterations in gene
expression that occur commonly in this cancer type and which
can inﬂuence visceral and brain metastatic disease. The evidence presented here appears to support such a hypothesis and
implicates the upregulation of EDNRB as an important
contributor to metastatic colonization and growth/survival in
the brain.
Our results provide direct evidence that EDNRB overexpression leads to enhanced metastatic aggressiveness of
melanoma and decreased median survival as a result of
advanced metastatic disease to lungs. This data correlate
well and extends previous studies, which have implicated
EDNRB as a marker of melanoma progression affecting
processes relevant to metastatic disease (27–29). Beyond
this role, evidence obtained from our model now implicates
EDNRB also as relevant factor in increasing the incidence of
spontaneous CNS metastases and promoting intracranial
melanoma growth. This effect appears to be mediated, at
least in part, through the interaction EDNRB with its ligands,
potentially ET3 which is highly expressed in the brain, so as
to enhance melanoma cell proliferation within the CNS. It is
possible that the high levels of EDNRB may also contribute
to increase the incidence of brain metastases by facilitating
other processes such as invasion and angiogenesis. Because
ET1 and ET3 are highly expressed in lungs (14), a similar
interaction of EDNRB with these ligands may mediate the
increased metastatic lung disease associated with EDNRB
overexpression. The fact that BCL2A1 overexpression did
not affect the incidence of spontaneous CNS metastases and
yet translated into enhanced intracranial tumor growth
highlights the different results that can be obtained when
using spontaneous or experimental metastasis models. It
would be interesting to examine whether other genes previously suggested to be relevant to melanoma CNS metastases (e.g., STAT3, TGFb-2, melanotransferrin; 30–32) can
indeed confer enhanced spontaneous CNS metastatic potential or whether their effect is only associated with facilitating
growth at the secondary site.
Overall, our results suggest that alterations in EDNRB
expression may be an important aspect of the stepwise progression of melanoma to the brain metastatic phenotype.
Because EDNRB also appears to inﬂuence visceral metastatic

disease, targeting of the EDNRB signaling pathway might
represent a promising therapeutic approach for anti-CNS
melanoma therapy. EDNRB inhibitors have already shown
signiﬁcant preclinical effects with respect to inhibiting the
growth of primary melanoma (33), in contrast, their effectiveness in treatment of melanoma CNS metastases has not been
examined. This is critical because agents that show efﬁcacy in
primary tumor therapy models may lack activity when treating
metastatic disease (34). Our identiﬁcation of the potential
relationship of EDNRB with brain metastases lends support
for such efforts being conducted and indeed this is being
pursued in ongoing studies in our laboratory.
An important aspect in the design of effective therapeutic
treatments against CNS metastases is the unique requirement that therapeutic agent show not only activity against
the tumor but also the ability to cross the BBB (35, 36). In
this respect, as reported here, we have found that despite the
in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity ascribed to A192621
EDNRB-speciﬁc inhibitor, and its signiﬁcant efﬁcacy against
visceral metastatic disease, it was not able to inhibit the
growth of intracranially implanted melanomas, at least
when given alone. This lack of efﬁcacy could be a consequence of poor penetration of this agent across the BBB. The
improved outcome associated with the combination of
A192621 with a PGP inhibitor (cyclosporin A) seems to
bolster the hypothesis that the lack of A192621 permeability
is, at least in part, because of this efﬂux pump which is
known to be highly expressed by brain endothelial cells. The
efﬁcacy of A192621 (at least in combination with cyclosporin
A) to inhibit intracranial melanoma suggests that the development of BBB-permeable EDNRB inhibitors could provide
an effective approach for treatment of CNS metastases. It is
worth noting that the signiﬁcant efﬁcacy achieved with
A192621 against visceral disease in our studies contrasts
the minimal effect achieved with other EDNRB inhibitors in
clinical trials (i.e., bosentan). It is likely that these differences
may be ascribed to a more effective binding and inhibition of
EDNRB achieved with A192621 (37, 38). Another important
difference is that our studies were conducted in an adjuvantlike setting (i.e., against residual disease and aimed at preventing the eventual emergence of overt metastases) rather
than in the advanced stages of metastatic disease commonly
studied in clinical trials. Given that no effective adjuvant
therapies against malignant melanoma are presently available, a reexamination of the use of EDNRB inhibitors in this
setting in clinical trials may be warranted.
Examination of other genes highlighted by our microarray
studies (which are likely to play a role in brain metastases) is
being conducted. This analysis may provide additional targets for therapy. Interestingly, none of the genes highlighted
in our analysis of melanoma brain metastatic disease overlap with those previously noted as inﬂuential to the brain
metastatic scenario in breast cancer (26, 39). This suggests
that the brain metastatic phenotype may not have a
common genetic signature across various cancer types but
rather that each cancer type likely makes use of different
mechanisms to effectively colonize the CNS. Our results
provide identiﬁcation of potential prognostic molecular

markers of melanoma brain metastases which are critical for
identifying patients that are at higher risk of developing CNS
metastases who could beneﬁt from early aggressive preventive treatment.
In addition to potentially shedding light on mediators that
may be relevant to brain metastasis, our model can also
serve as a tool to examine the efﬁcacy of novel antimelanoma therapies. Recent successes achieved with BRAFV600E
inhibitors highlight the importance of this mutant protein to
melanoma metastasis (4). Our model expresses this predominant mutation, thus it represents an important tool to
examine its relevance to brain metastatic disease and the
effects of its inhibition in therapy against CNS metastases.
