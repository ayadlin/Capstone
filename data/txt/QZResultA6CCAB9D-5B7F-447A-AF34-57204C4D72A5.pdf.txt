ABSTRACT
We recently found that trastuzumab benefit may be lower in a small subset of
early breast cancer (BC) patients (pts) with tumors expressing high levels of both
hormonal receptors (HRs), i.e. triple positive (TP). To better investigate the role of
HRs in HER2 positive BC, we retrospectively identified 872 TP BC pts treated with
adjuvant chemotherapy alone (cohort A-366 pts), or plus trastuzumab (cohort B-506
pts). Relapse-free-survival (RFS) and breast-cancer-specific-survival (BCSS) were
evaluated. Trastuzumab improved RFS and BCSS in all the subsets analyzed, but the
effect on BCSS in tumors expressing both HRs in >30% of cells (TP30), and even on

RFS in tumors with both HRs expressed in >50% of cells (TP50) was not significant.
Distinct patterns of relapse were observed in TP50 and no-TP50 tumors, the former
showing low and constant risk in the first 5 years, a late increase beyond 5 years and
modest trastuzumab effect. Trastuzumab effect tended to disappear in pts whose
tumors expressed ER in >50% of cells. Multivariate analysis of RFS confirmed a
significant interaction between trastuzumab and ER expression, with benefit confined
to pts whose tumors expressed ER in ≤50% of cells.
Our data suggest that the pattern of relapse of TP tumors with high HRs is similar
to that of “luminal”, HER2 negative tumors, without clear benefit from adjuvant
trastuzumab, which remains the standard treatment even in TP tumors. Confirmatory
findings on the extent to which quantitative expression of HRs may impact clinical
behavior of HER2 positive BC are warranted.

in all breast cancer subsets, including TP tumors, with the
unique exception of a small cohort of tumors expressing
very high levels (≥50%) of both HRs (TP50) [13].
In order to better define and interpret the outcome
of adjuvant treatment specifically in this relevant subset,
we expanded our initial cohort of TP, early breast cancer
patients treated with chemotherapy with or without
trastuzumab in the routine clinical practice by adding data
collected in nineteen Italian oncologic centres.

INTRODUCTION
Approximately 25% of breast cancers overexpress the
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) and have
an aggressive clinical behaviour [1]. About half of HER-2
positive breast cancer also express hormone receptors (HRs),
even if HER-2 positive tumors often, though not always,
express HRs at lower levels compared with HR positive/
HER-2 negative tumors [2]. Overall, the use of trastuzumab
combined with chemotherapy has dramatically improved
prognosis in all stages of HER-2 positive breast cancer
[3-5]. There has been a general consensus in fact, that the
HER-2 oncogene, when overexpressed, is the dominant
driver of breast cancer biology, regardless of HR status [6],
and current guidelines support the use of anti-HER-2 agents
combined with chemotherapy in all the disease settings.
Even though treatment with HER-2 targeted agents in all
stages of HER-2 positive breast cancer has shown benefit
independently on HR status, it is now being increasingly
clear that the magnitude of such benefit may differ by HR
status. In the adjuvant setting recent reports of outcomes
by tumor subtype demonstrated that HR positive/HER2 positive tumors show usually different behavior and
response to therapy, as well as distinct timing and pattern
of relapse in comparison to HR negative/HER-2 positive
tumors [6-10]. Yet, no data on outcome are specifically
reported on tumors expressing HER-2 and both HRs, i.e.,
estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR).
The subset of “triple positive” (TP: ER/PgR/HER-2 positive)
tumors might represent a distinct entity with a particularly
favourable prognosis, and the combination of chemotherapy,
HER-2 blockade and endocrine treatment, in some instances,
might be considered an overtreatment. Thus far, only few
studies evaluated the degree of HRs expression in HER-2
positive disease, together with its influence on treatment
efficacy and prognosis [11, 12] and, to our knowledge, no
study has focused on TP treatment outcomes.
In a recent work we analyzed data from a large
historic cohort of HER-2 positive early breast cancer
patients treated with chemotherapy alone or with
sequential trastuzumab at various Italian cancer centres
between 1998 and 2011. Results were in key with a clear
benefit of adding trastuzumab to adjuvant chemotherapy

RESULTS
Patient and tumor characteristics
Overall, we retrospectively identified 872
consecutive, TP positive, early breast cancer patients
treated in routine clinical practice in nineteen Italian
cancer centers between January 1998 and December 2011.
Main baseline patient and tumor characteristics
are reported in Table 1. Overall, the HER-2 gene was
overexpressed (3+) in 716 (82.1%) and amplified in 156
tumors (17.9%). Among the patients enrolled, 366 (41.9%)
and 506 (58%) patients received adjuvant chemotherapy
without (cohort A) and with trastuzumab (cohort B),
respectively. Median age and menopausal status were well
balanced between the two cohorts. Conversely, patients in
cohort B had more frequently higher stage, grade 3 and
high Ki67 tumors, compared with those in cohort A.

Adjuvant treatment
Data on adjuvant treatments are reported in
Table 2. Overall, among 872 enrolled patients, 34.4%
patients received anthracycline-based, 8.4% taxanebased, 44.8% anthracycline+taxane-based, and 12.4%
anthracycline-taxane-free chemotherapy. Anthracyclinebased regimens were more common in cohort A (51.4%)
than in cohort B (22.1%). Conversely, more patients
received anthracycline+taxanes-based regimens in cohort
B (62.5%), compared to cohort A (20.2%). A comparable
proportion of patients in both cohorts received 6 or more
cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy (71.3% and 78.3% in
cohort A and B, respectively). Trastuzumab was given

sequentially in 28% of the patients, and concomitantly
with chemotherapy in 72% of the patients. The majority
of patients (93.2%) received the three-weekly schedule
of trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose, followed by threeweekly doses of 6 mg/kg), with a median duration of
52 weeks (range, 6-75). All but 70 patients (8%) started
standard adjuvant hormonal therapy upon completion of
chemotherapy. Radiotherapy was given when indicated,
according to the Institutional guidelines.

To study the effect of different cutoffs of HRs
expression in TP tumors we defined a TP30 (both ER and
PgR expressed in >30% of tumor cells) and a TP50 (both
ER and PgR expressed in >50% of tumor cells) populations.
Estimates of 3- and 5-year RFS and BCSS in the overall, the
TP30 and the TP50 populations are summarized in Table 3.
Adjuvant trastuzumab (cohort B) was associated with a RFS
and BCSS benefit in the overall study population. In addition,
no differences were observed in outcomes depending on
treatment schedule (weekly or three-weekly, concomitant or
sequential with chemotherapy), and use of regimens including
anthracyclines and taxanes (data available upon request).
However, the BCSS advantage in the TP30 populations and
both the RFS and BCSS advantages in the TP50 populations
failed to reach statistical significance (Table 3). To further
explore the potential effect of having both ER and PgR
expressed in more than 50% of tumor cells, we compared
the annualized hazards of RFS for cohort A and B patients
in the overall, TP50, and no-TP50 (i.e. remainder patients,
whose tumor do not have simultaneous expression of ER and

DISCUSSION

PgR in >50% of tumor cells) populations (Figure 2, panels
a, b and c, respectively). In the no-TP50 population, relapse
events tended to occur during the initial 5 years at a constant
rate and the effect of trastuzumab in reducing relapse events
appeared constant over this time-interval (Figure 2, panel c).
Conversely, in TP50 patients (Figure 2, panel b) a clear effect
of trastuzumab could not be observed and in both cohorts
the hazards of relapse tended to increase slightly beyond 5
years of follow-up. We performed a STEPP analysis to relate
increasing percentages of cells staining positively for ER
(Figure 3, panel a) and for PgR (Figure 3, panel b) with the
risk of relapsing at 5 years according to cohort. For ER, we
observed a clear reduction in such risk beyond 50% of tumor
cells staining positively, whereas no such effect was seen for
increasing PgR expression. At multivariate analysis factors
related to increased risk of relapse at 5 years were presence of
multifocality, high tumor grade, advanced stage at diagnosis,
no adjuvant endocrine therapy, no adjuvant trastuzumab and
ER≤50%. Since we found a significant 2X2 interaction of
ER expression with the effect of trastuzumab (p = 0.01), in
the final model we report the effect of trastuzumab across
the two strata of the ER50 variable, together with the other
variables independently associated with RFS (Table 4). In the
ER>50 stratum, trastuzumab showed no significant effect on
5-year RFS.

In this retrospective analysis, we sought to expand
our previous observation that in patients with operable
HER2-positive breast cancer, high co-expression of both
the ER and PgR (“triple-positivity”-TP) could mitigate
the effect of trastuzumab administered with adjuvant
chemotherapy [13]. In fact, in the RETROHER study,
we found little benefit of adjuvant trastuzumab in 163
women with HER2-positive operable breast cancer whose
tumors were positive for both the ER and PgR in ≥50%
of tumor cells. We thought that this initial observation
deserved further investigation. To better study the
influence of degree and pattern of HRs expression on
clinical behavior and trastuzumab efficacy, we recruited
872 patients with TP breast cancer selected on the basis
of a HER2-positive status and simultaneous expression of
both ER and PgR in at least 1% of the tumor cells. Our
first finding was that hazard ratios for RFS and BCSS
were consistently in favor of trastuzumab in the overall,
TP30 and TP50 populations, although differences failed
to achieve statistical significance for BCSS in the TP30,
and for RFS and BCSS in the TP50 populations. Fiveyear absolute, trastuzumab-related RFS gains were 9.5%
and 6.9% for TP30 and TP50 patients respectively, with

apparently no effect on BCSS (0.9% and 1.7% for TP30
and TP50 patients, respectively). Corresponding figures
in the overall population were 11.7% and 3.4% for RFS
and BCSS, respectively (Table  3). A second finding of
our study was that the annualized hazard of relapse in
TP50 patients differs profoundly from that of patients
whose tumors do not have simultaneous expression of ER
and PgR in >50% of tumor cells (No-TP50) (Figure 2).
Furthermore, in this latter group of patients, a favorable
effect of trastuzumab was seen early and persisted for
4-6 years from surgery. Conversely, for TP50 patients
the annualized hazard of disease relapse tended to remain
low and constant for about 6 years from surgery and to
increase thereafter, with no clear pattern regarding the
effect of trastuzumab. The third finding of our study
was that expression of the ER in >50% of tumor cells
was associated with a potential reduction in the effect
of trastuzumab on RFS, and a statistically significant
interaction could be demonstrated at the multivariate
analysis (Table 4). Taken together, these results suggest
that trastuzumab added to chemotherapy must remain a
standard of care in patients with HER2 positive tumors,
regardless hormone receptor status. However, quantitative
expression of HRs may influence the clinical behavior of
HER2-positive breast cancer, with potentially relevant
implications in the estimation of risk and timing of relapse
and, finally, on treatment choices.
In the interpretation of these results we must
consider obvious biases that are related to the
retrospective methodology that we used. Cohort A and
B were sequential and not parallel, resulting in median
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

follow-up in cohort A being twice as long as that of
patients in cohort B. Consequently, more disease relapses
and breast cancer deaths may have occurred in cohort
A just because of longer observation time. Although
HER2-positivity confers early metastatic potential,
long term follow-up of the adjuvant HERA trial shows
events beyond 5 years in patients receiving trastuzumab
[14]. Therefore, we could not exclude that 60 months of
median follow-up of cohort B of our study is insufficient
to capture all the events.
Furthermore, because of the non-randomized
design, some imbalances were seen in cohort A and B
with respect to histopathological features. Although more
frequently high-stage, high-grade and highly proliferating,
tumors in cohort B were also more frequently high in
HRs expression than patients in cohort A (Table 1). This
is another factor that may have biased the comparison of
outcomes between the two cohorts.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the ER/
PgR expression level is just a surrogate for molecular
subtyping, and quantitative analysis of ER and PgR
status was not centralized, but extracted from the medical
charts of the patients at each participating Institution.
As a consequence, inter-laboratory variability and bias
cannot be excluded and should be taken into account in
interpreting our results [15].
Several adjunctive variables, not investigated in the
present study, such as the level of stromal Lymphocyte
Tumor Infiltration (sTIL) and PIK3CA mutations,
EGFR or PTEN expression, along with distinct intrinsic
molecularly-defined subtypes, may have influenced

outcomes [16-21]. Despite the numerous potential biases,
we believe in the biological and clinical plausibility of
our results and in their potential implications for further
research in this area.
In HER2-negative breast cancer, a number of
studies have confirmed that late disease-related events
are common in HRs positive patients [22]. This translates
into a time-dependent hazard ratio for HRs positive vs
HRs negative tumors [23, 24]. This same phenomenon
was recently observed in women enrolled in the adjuvant
Tykerb Evaluation after Chemotherapy (TEACH) clinical
trial [25], where patients with HER2 positive operable
breast cancer not receiving adjuvant trastuzumab were
randomized to adjuvant lapatinib or observation at a
median time from diagnosis of 70 months. A recent report
focusing on patients assigned to the placebo arm revealed
that HR status (positive vs negative) had a time-varying
effect on the hazard of disease relapse [26]. HRs positive
tumors showed a slowly decreasing hazard compared
with HRs negative tumors, which showed a higher and
more rapidly declining hazard of disease-relapse during
follow-up. At approximately 6 years, the two annualized
hazard curves tended to cross. This observation confirms
that HR status (positive vs negative) may influence clinical
behavior also in HER2-positive breast cancer.
Since high expression of ER and PgR is regarded
as a proxy for an “endocrine-responsive” behavior we
decided to focus our analysis on TP tumors [27]. In line
with the previously mentioned results, we could show
that, within HER2-positive/HRs positive breast cancers,
the expression of either or both ER and PgR in >50% of
tumor cells identifies entities that behave like “endocrineresponsive” tumors. Additionally, STEPP analysis could
show a sharp reduction in the effect of trastuzumab in
tumors expressing the ER in more than 50% of the cells.
An intriguing retrospective evaluation of eight
predictive genes associated with HER2 or ER in the
NSABP-B31 trial showed that high-levels of ESR1 mRNA
expression may be associated to low trastuzumab benefit
[28]. We may hypothesize that the high ER expression
level in a subset of patients in the present study might be
representative of the subgroup with higher ESR1 mRNA
expression.
Conversely to widespread belief in the early
2000s, it is now widely recognized that HER2 positive
tumors are not homogeneous and that HRs coexpression represents a robust biomarker of both the
clinical behavior and the effect of anti-HER2 treatments
[29]. This latter factor emerged clearly in the neoadjuvant setting, when results of the NEO-ALTTO
and NEO-SPHERE trials, evaluating neoadjuvant
taxanes with anti HER2 treatments in HER2-positive
patients, showed a clear reduction in pCR when the
tumor co-expressed HRs, mirrored by very high pCR
in HER2-positive/HRs negative tumors [30, 31].
Further observations from retrospective studies in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the metastatic and neoadjuvant setting also suggested
a potential relationship between degree of HRs
expression and response to trastuzumab treatment, with
reduced activity in patients with high-expression [11,
12]. Additionally, while predicting shorter disease-free
survival in HER2-positive/HRs negative tumors, failing
to achieve a pCR following neoadjuvant treatment
does not preclude favorable long-term outcomes in
HER2-positive/HRs positive tumors [32]. This effect
on outcome is clearly due to the fact that, despite
being acknowledged as a predictor of resistance to
endocrine therapy, in the context of HER2 inhibition,
HER2-positive/HRs positive tumors can partially
recover endocrine-responsiveness [33-35]. Indeed,
a retrospective study confirmed long progressionfree survival in women assigned to trastuzumab and
maintenance endocrine therapy after stable disease
or tumor response to first-line chemotherapy and
trastuzumab [11]. The biology behind HER2-positive
breast cancer provides explanations for this clinical
diversity, calling into cross-talk between the HER2 and
HRs pathways [29, 32, 36]. Traditionally, this crosstalk has been considered unidirectional, where aberrant
HER2 function could provide escape to endocrine
therapy. Recent data suggest bidirectional and dynamic
cross-talk, where also the HRs pathway could provide
escape to HER2-inhibition. A neoadjuvant study
of HER2 targeting agents and endocrine therapy
showed an increase in pCR when both treatments are
administered concomitantly, thus confirming preclinical
models [37]. Biological diversity has been recently
further clarified in the most comprehensive molecular
characterization of breast cancer, which clearly shows
that two distinct HER2 positive breast cancer exist
[38]. One is the HER2-enriched mRNA subtype,
which is characterized by increased expression of
tyrosine-kinase receptor like FGFR4, EGFR, and of
genes mapping on the HER2 amplicon. The other is
the luminal mRNA subtype positive, with increased
expression of luminal genes like BCL2, GATA3 and
ESR1. One major phenotypical difference between
these two subgroups is the expression of hormone
receptors, which is rare in the former, and frequent in
the latter subtype. Unfortunately, immunohistochemical
surrogates of these two distinct biological entities are
barely obtainable in the clinic, being the mere positivity
for either the ER or PgR a definition that could
encompass both subtypes. Therefore, additional markers
of the “luminal/HER2-positive” phenotype are awaited
to better exploit biological diversity in the clinic. A
recent report from Neoadjuvant Breast Symphony trial
compared a multigene classifier (Blue-Print 80-gene
assay) to conventional IHC/FISH to predict pCR to
chemotherapy plus HER2 block. The Blue-Print (BP)
assay re-classified more than 1 over 5 tumors, and the
group with the biggest change was the TP group, where
17940

the BP-defined “luminal” subgroup showed the lower
pCR to trastuzumab (11%), compared to that of the BPdefined HER2 (45%); the pCR increased with doubleblock including pertuzumab [39].
Overall, we provide evidence that the clinical
behavior of TP breast cancer could depend upon
quantitative expression of HRs, with highly co-expressing
tumors behaving in a luminal fashion, i.e., low but
constant hazard of relapse in the initial 5 years after
surgery, and possibly, slow increase thereafter resulting
in late recurrences. Furthermore, increasing expression
of ER seems to be associated with reduced trastuzumab
effect. We believe, however, that future studies should
try to address this issue with appropriate methodology
because of the potential implications on treatment tailoring
according to the biological diversity of HER2-positive
breast cancer.

satellite centers and was conducted in compliance with
Helsinki Declaration.

Statistical analysis
Associations between categorical variables were
tested by the Pearson Chi Square test or the Fisher Exact
test, when appropriate. Relapse-free survival (RFS, time
from surgery to any invasive or non-invasive breast
cancer recurrence, either local, regional, contralateral or
distant) and breast cancer specific survival (BCSS, time
from surgery to death in patients who had developed
metastatic disease) where chosen as outcome variables of
interest. For both RFS and BCSS, patients dying without
prior evidence of metastatic disease were censored at the
date of their last follow-up visit. Median follow-up was
calculated with the reverse method [40]. Kaplan-Meier
curves of RFS and BCSS were compared by the log-rank
test, with statistical significance set at p≤0.05. The impact
of independent variables of interest on 5-years RFS was
studied by univariate and multivariate logistic regression
model. Odds Ratios are reported together with their 95%
confidence intervals (95% C.I.). For the multivariate
analyses we adopted a stepwise regression (forward
selection) method by selecting significant variables upon
univariate analysis. Enter limit and remove limit were
p = 0.10 and p = 0.15, respectively. The annual hazard
function, giving the risk of disease at a specified time
conditional on remaining disease-free up until that point
in time, was estimated by cohorts and by HR status using
splines, with separate splines fit for the cohort and by HR
status. The subpopulation treatment effect pattern plot
(STEPP) analysis was performed to evaluate treatmenteffect heterogeneity when HRs expression is measured
on a continuous scale. STEPP graphically explores the
patterns of treatment effect across overlapping intervals
of the HRs values [41]. The SPSS software (SPSS version
21.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA) and R-Software
(version 3.2.1) were used for statistical evaluations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Our cohort included patients with early TP tumors
routinely treated in the adjuvant setting in nineteen Italian
oncologic centres over a period of thirteen years (from
1998 to 2011). Written informed consent was obtained
from all patients. Information on demographics, clinical,
histopathological and molecular features, adjuvant
therapies and outcomes were retrieved from the patients’
medical records. Anonymized data were entered into an
ad hoc database. Two cohorts were analyzed: patients who
received adjuvant chemotherapy without trastuzumab,
mostly until 2005 (cohort A), and patients who received
adjuvant chemotherapy followed by or combined with
trastuzumab (cohort B) since 2006, when adjuvant
trastuzumab was approved in Italy. Endocrine treatment
and radiotherapy were sequentially given whenever
indicated according to standard guidelines.
Pathology assessment was performed on surgical
specimens by the pathologists at the participating centers
as per National standards. ER and PgR status were
determined at each center by immunohistochemistry
according to local standards. Positivity was considered
at a cutoff of ≥1 % of tumor cells stained. Ki-67 was
tested using the mAb MIB1 (Dako) and regarded high
if >14 % of the cell nuclei were immunostained. HER2
overexpression was tested using the polyclonal antibody
A0485 (Dako), and was considered positive if grade 3+
staining intensity by immunohistochemistry, or grade
2+ with gene amplification by fluorescence, silver
or chromogenic in situ hybridization was detected.
Definitions and cutoffs for HER2 positivity were the same
as those used in the pivotal trastuzumab adjuvant trials. If
missing, the molecular features were centrally evaluated
in formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections,
whenever available. This study was approved by the
institutional ethical committee of the coordinating center
(Regina Elena National Cancer Institute of Rome) and
