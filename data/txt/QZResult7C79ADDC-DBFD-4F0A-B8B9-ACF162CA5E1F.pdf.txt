ABSTRACT
Early studies indicated that mast cells in prostate tumor microenvironment might
influence prostate cancer (PCa) progression. Their impacts to PCa therapy, however,
remained unclear. Here we found PCa could recruit more mast cells than normal
prostate epithelial cells then alter PCa chemotherapy and radiotherapy sensitivity,
leading to PCa more resistant to these therapies. Mechanism dissection revealed that
infiltrated mast cells could increase p21 expression via modulation of p38/p53 signals,
and interrupting p38-p53 signals via siRNAs of p53 or p21 could reverse mast cellinduced docetaxel chemotherapy resistance of PCa. Furthermore, recruited mast cells
could also increase the phosphorylation of ATM at ser-1981 site, and inhibition of ATM
activity could reverse mast cell-induced radiotherapy resistance. The in vivo mouse
model with xenografted PCa C4-2 cells co-cultured with mast cells also confirmed that
mast cells could increase PCa chemotherapy resistance via activating p38/p53/p21
signaling. Together, our results provide a new mechanism showing infiltrated mast
cells could alter PCa chemotherapy and radiotherapy sensitivity via modulating the
p38/p53/p21 signaling and phosphorylation of ATM. Targeting this newly identified
signaling may help us better suppress PCa chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance.

microenvironment [3–5]. However, the impacts
of these infiltrating immune cells together with
the inflammatory cytokines they secrete on PCa
progression and therapies remain unclear.
Mast cells have been reported to play important
roles in allergy or angiogenesis [6, 7]. In PCa, mast
cells increase during development of PIN in TRAMP
mice and human tissue [8]. Our early results showed
that mast cells could enhance PCa cell invasion via
increasing stem/progenitor cell population [9]. ADT
with enzalutamide could increase PCa neuroendocrine
(NE) differentiation capabilities via recruitment of
infiltrating mast cells [10].
Chemotherapy with docetaxel has been proved to
be able to improve survival of PCa patients at castration
resistant stage [11, 12]. However, the chemo-resistance

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most
common diagnosed cancer worldwide, and the most
common cancer in men of developed countries [1]. It
is well known that androgen- androgen receptor (AR)
signals play key roles in PCa progression. Androgen
Deprivation Therapy (ADT) to reduce or prevent
androgens binding to AR is the major treatment for the
advanced PCa. However, it will eventually relapse and
develop into castration resistance after 1–2 years of
treatment [2].
More evidence suggested that PCa progression
might be associated with inflammatory cells
infiltration. PCa treated with ADT may result in
recruitment of various immune cells, including T
cells, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, mast cells,

may develop rapidly without clear mechanism [13, 14] and
its linkage to inflammation also remains unclear. Similarly,
though radiotherapy (RT) for localized PCa also contribute
to improved survival of patients [15], the influences of
immune responses on RT remain to be further elucidated
[16, 17].
Here we found infiltrating mast cells could enhance
PCa resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy via
activation of p38/p53/p21 and ATM signals.

Together, results from Figure 1A–1B suggest that
PCa may have better capacity than normal prostate to
recruit mast cells.

Recruited mast cells alter the PCa chemotherapy
sensitivity
To study the potential consequences of PCa cells
to recruit more mast cells, we then applied the co-culture
system to assay the chemo-sensitivity of PCa under
docetaxel treatment (Figure 2A), and results revealed
that after recruitment of more mast cells, the PCa C4-2
cells became more resistant to docetaxel chemotherapy of
both 24 and 48 hours (Figure 2B). Similar results were
also obtained when we replaced PCa C4-2 cells with
CWR22Rv1 cells (Figure 2C).
Interestingly, we also found that recruited mast cells
could inhibit docetaxel-induced cell apoptosis in C4-2 and
CWR22Rv1 cells with decreased apoptosis marker of clea­
ved PARP and cleaved caspase3 expression (Figure 2D–2E).
Together, results from Figure 2A–2E suggest that
infiltrating mast cells could decrease docetaxel-induced
PCa cell apoptosis and enhance PCa cells’ resistance to
docetaxel.

RESULTS
Prostate cancer recruits more mast cells than
normal prostate
Previous studies suggested that several tumors,
including PCa, might be able to recruit mast cells [9, 10,
18]. Using the Boyden chamber migration system (see
the cartoon in Figure 1A), we found here that PCa C4-2
cells have better capacity than normal prostate RWPE-1
cells to recruit more mast cells (Figure 1B). Similar results
were also obtained when we replaced C4-2 PCa cells with
PCa CWR22Rv1 cells (Figure 1B).

Mechanism why recruited mast cells could alter
PCa cells chemotherapy sensitivity

colony formation assay, we found C4-2 cells alone had
better sensitivity to radiotherapy than those co-cultured
with mast cells (Figure 4A). Similar results were
also obtained when we replaced C4-2 PCa cells with
CWR22Rv1 cells (Figure 4B).
Using another approach to measure the radiation
sensitivity with the alkaline-comet assay, we found the
PCa cells (C4-2 and CWR22Rv1) co-cultured with mast
cells had less DNA damage after radiotherapy compared
with the control group (Figure 4C–4D).
Together, results from Figure 4A–4D suggested
that recruited mast cells could also enhance PCa cells’
resistance to radiotherapy.

To dissect the molecular mechanism how recruited
mast cells could alter PCa chemotherapy sensitivity, we
focused on the p38-p53-p21 signals since early studies
indicated that they might play key roles in altering
chemotherapy sensitivity [19]. As shown in Figure 3A,
the expression of phosphorylation-p38 (p-p38), p53 and
p21 were increased in PCa C4-2 and CWR22Rv1 cells
after co-culture with mast cells (Figure 3A). Furthermore,
we also found that the expression of phosphorylation-p38
(p-p38), p53 and p21 were increased even in the presence
of DTX (Supplementary Figure S1A).
We then applied the interruption approach with the
inhibitor of p38 (SB23580) to suppress phosphorylation
of p38. Results showed that inhibition of p38 signaling
could partially reverse the mast cell-induced expression of
p-p38, p53 and p21, with partially restoration of PCa cells
sensitivity to docetaxel treatment (Figure 3B–3C). When
we knocked down p38, we also obtained the similar results
(Supplementary Figure S1B). Furthermore, knocking
down p53 or p21 could also partially reverse mast cellinduced PCa docetaxel resistance (Figure 3D–3G).
Together, results from Figure 3A–3G and
Supplementary Figure S1A–S1B suggested that infiltrating
mast cells could induce PCa cells resistance to docetaxel
via activating p38/p53/p21 signaling.

Mechanism dissection why recruited mast cells
could alter radiotherapy sensitivity
To dissect the molecular mechanism how recruited
mast cells alter PCa radiotherapy sensitivity, we focused
on the expression of ATM, the key player in response
to radiation [20, 21]. We found that the expression of
phosphorylated ATM (ser-1981) was increased after coculture with mast cells in C4-2 and CWR22Rv1 cells
(Figure 5A), but the activity of another key molecule ATR
had no change (Supplementary Figure S2A).
We then applied the interruption approach with ATM
kinase inhibitor KU-55933 to see if inhibition of ATM
activity could abolish co-culture-induced radiotherapy
resistance of PCa cells. As shown in Figure 5B, addition
of ATM kinase inhibitor could reverse co-culture-induced
radiotherapy resistance of PCa cells.

Mast cells enhance PCa cells chemotherapy
resistance in vivo
To demonstrate the in vitro cell lines results above
in the in vivo mouse model, we subcutaneously injected
PCa cells into 6 to 8 week old male nude mice. 8 mice
were injected subcutaneously with 1 × 106 C4-2 cells preco-cultured with mast cells for 1 week, as a mixture with
Matrigel, 1:1 and another 8 mice were injected with 1 × 106
C4-2 cells, as a mixture with Matrigel, 1:1. After 2 weeks,
the mice were then treated with docetaxel (15 mg/kg,
2 times/week) for another 3 weeks before sacrifice.
The results, after continue monitoring the growth
curve of these two groups mice, revealed that mice pretreated with mast cells showed more resistance to docetaxel
(Figure 3H) , with bigger tumor volume and heavier tumor
weight than those in the control group (Figure 3I). Results
from IHC staining of p-p38 and p21 were also in agreement
with in-vitro co-culture studies, showing that infiltrating
mast cells could increase p-p38, p21 and ki-67 expression,
but decrease cleaved caspase3 expression (Figure 3J).

DISCUSSION
Docetaxel is a well-established anti-microtubule
chemotherapy agent. Microtubules are dynamic
filamentous proteins that play key roles in a range of
cellular functions providing integrity and preserving
cellular architecture and cellular protein transport [22,
23]. Docetaxel-based chemotherapy showed some
improvement of approximately 3 months in median
overall survival in PCa when compared with mitoxantrone
treatment [24]. However, most patients with docetaxel
chemotherapy still suffered from progression of their
disease within 1 year from the start of treatment [25],
suggesting that there exist some molecular mechanisms
that lead to the development of docetaxel resistance.
Early mechanism dissection suggested that
docetaxel resistance might be linked to altering the AR
signals including AR gene amplification, AR mutations,
and overexpression of AR co-regulators [26]. Other ARindependent mechanisms involved the modulating the
Akt/PI3K and MAPK/ERK [27, 28], mTOR [29], nuclear
factor-kappa B (NFκB)/IL-6 [30] and Hedgehog [31]
signaling pathways. Furthermore, the interactions between
cancer cells and the surrounding microenvironment

we are also interested to see the effect of recruited mast

[32, 33], as well as their secreted cytokines and growth
factors (for example, IL-6 and stromal cell-derived factor
1), and altering the ECM [34] may also play key roles to
development of docetaxel resistance.
Our results indicated that infiltrating mast cells could
increase phosphorylation of p38 and interruption of this
increased p38 could reverse mastcell-induced docetaxel
resistance. This is interesting since P38 has been shown to
play a dual role in progression of different cells: functions
asmediators of apoptosis in some selective cells including
neurons [35, 36] or cardiac cells [37, 38], yet also function
as pro-tumorigenic role with positive correlation to bad
prognosis in cancers. For example, p38 may lead to
survival or proliferation of some cancers, including breast
cancer [39], colorectal cancer [40], prostate cancer [41].
Here we found that infiltrating mast cells could increase
phosphorylation of p38 and that inhibition of p38 could
reverse mastcell-induced docetaxel resistance.
The tumor suppressor p53 has an essential role in
promoting antitumor drug response in its wild-type state,
and tumor cells harboring wild-type p53 are generally
recognized as being more sensitive to antitumor agents
[42], which is consistent with the concept that activation
of wild type p53 is sufficient to induce cell death [43].

Unfortunately, such tumor cells do eventually
become resistant to therapy [44, 45], and mutant or p53null tumor cells undergo apoptosis are also involved in
the development of chemotherapy resistance [46, 47]. For
example, overexpression of wild-typep53 may be linked to
the increased resistance to cisplatin-based chemotherapy
in breast and ovarian cancer [48, 49], as well as in
docetaxel resistancein PCa cells [19, 50].
Here we found that recruitment of mast cells to PCa
cellsinduced docetaxel resistance via increased expression
of wild-type p53. Although it has also been reported that
DU145 (mutant p53) and PC3 (p53 null) cells were less
sensitive than LNCaP and C4-2 cells expressing functional
p53 in response to docetaxel, The reason for the conflict
among these conclusions remains unclear while a possile
explanation lies in the different passages or variants of
prostate cancer cells used by different laboratories.
P21, the downstream gene of p53, functions as a
regulator of cell cycle progression by binding to CDK/
cyclin complexes, is associated with testicular cancer
andovarian cancer resistance to cisplatin chemotherapy
[51–53], and itsincreased expression is also associated
with PCa cells docetaxel resistance [19, 54]. Here we
found that infiltrating mast cells in PCa could also lead to

increased p21 expression and its cytoplasmic accumulation
via modulation of p38 signal, and that knocking down p21
could reverse mast cell-induced doxetaxel resistance.
Currently, radiationtherapy is one of the most
common definitive treatment options for localized prostate
cancer, and recent advances in volumetric based intensity
modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and image guided
radiation therapy (IGRT) have permitted radiation dose
escalation beyond 75Gy with external therapy, which has
reduced both biochemical failure rate and the development
of metastasis [55, 56]. However, a significant number of
patients undergoing radiation therapy will develop locally
persistent/recurrent tumors [57]. One possible reason
for these failures is that there exists a subpopulation of
prostate tumor cells with intrinsic radioresistance within
the tumor. The ATM protein kinase is a key component of
the signal transduction pathway activated byDNA damage
[20, 21], and adiation can induce rapid intermolecular
autophosphorylation which leads to dimer dissociation and
ATM kinase activation [58]. The activated ATM protein
kinase may then co-ordinate DNA damage response to
alter the cell cycle checkpointsand DNA repair (e.g., p53)
system [58, 59]. Cells lacking functional ATM protein
show increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation [60]. Here
we also found that infiltrating mast cells in PCa could
induce PCa radiation resistance via activation of ATM
signals. It has also been reported that ATM could activate

p53 in response to DNA damage [59, 61, 62]. We found
mast cells could increase ATM phosphorylation and p53
expression, but when we applied the ATM kinase inhibitor
KU-55933, it failed to abrogate the mast-cell-induced
increased expression of p53, which implied that increased
expression of p53 induced by mast cells is due to the
activation of p38 signal instead of ATM activation.
Mast cells play a key role in the pathogenesis of
cardiovascular diseasesand cancers via secreting a variety
of cytokines includingTNF-α, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL10, IL-13, IL-14 and IL-16 [63–65]. We screened some
candidates potentially activating p38 signal including IL4, IL-5 and IL-6 [66–68], and results revealed that IL-6
increased in the medium of both C4-2 and CWR22Rv1
cells after co-culture with mast cells (Supplementary
Figure S3). Interestingly, it is reported that increased
expression of IL-6 could also activate ATM via increasing
its phosphorylation [69]. Based on these results and
reports, mast cell-induced activation of p38 and ATM
signals may go through increased expression of IL-6 after
co-culture with PCa cells.
In summary, infiltrating mast cells can promote PCa
chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance via activating
p38/p53/p21 and ATM signals (Figure 6). Future studies to
target these newly identified signals may provide us with
a new potential therapeutic approach to better battle PCa
chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance.

Mast cell recruitment assay

Western blot analysis

Mast cell migration was detected by using a 24well transwell assay. Briefly, prostate cells conditioned
mediums were placed in the lower chamber of a 24-well.
Mast cells (1 × 105 cells) were then seeded in the upper
chamber. The upper and lower chamber were separated by
an 8 μm polycarbonate filter coated with fibronectin (10
μg/ml, sc-29011 Santa Cruz) and dried for 1 hr in the hood.
The chambers were incubated for 4 hours at 37°C, Filters
were then scraped, washed, fixed with cold methanol,
and stained with 1% toludine blue. Cell migration was
measured by counting the number of cells attached to
the lower surface of the filter. Each conditioned medium
was tested in triplicate. The results were expressed as the
average of the number of migrating cells.

Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and proteins (20
μg) were separated on 10–12% SDS/PAGE gel and then
transferred onto PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica,
MA). After blocking membranes, they were incubated with
appropriate dilutions (1:1000) of specific primary antibodies.
