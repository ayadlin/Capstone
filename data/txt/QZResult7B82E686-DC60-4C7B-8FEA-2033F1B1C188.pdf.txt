BACKGROUND: A study was undertaken to examine the patterns of systemic therapy use in conjunction with radiation therapy for patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancer. METHODS: Between December
1, 2005 and May 11, 2009, 2874 patients with newly diagnosed head and neck squamous cell cancer who were scheduled to receive radiotherapy and/or drug therapy were registered in a prospective national database. The database
was specifically analyzed to examine patients who received chemotherapy in conjunction with definitive radiotherapy.
RESULTS: A total of 1144 patients received systemic therapy in conjunction with radiotherapy; 645 (56%) patients
received agents concurrent with radiation therapy, 49 (4%) patients received chemotherapy before radiotherapy
(induction), 224 (20%) patients received chemotherapy before and during radiotherapy (sequential), and 226 (20%)
patients received chemoradiation after surgery. Single-agent cisplatin, single-agent cetuximab, and carboplatin plus
paclitaxel were, in order, the 3 most commonly prescribed concurrent regimens. Concurrent cisplatin was more frequently used in the academic setting compared with the community setting (P ¼ .0015). Postoperative chemoradiation, rather than radiation alone, was more commonly used in academic centers compared with community practice
centers (P ¼ <.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The LORHAN (Longitudinal Oncology Registry of Head and Neck Carcinoma)
database is a useful barometer of current US practice patterns and can be applied to analyze future trends in the
combined modality management of head and neck cancer. Sequential chemotherapy is used frequently, but cisplatinbased concurrent chemoradiation remains the most commonly used regimen for locally advanced head and neck

KEYWORDS: head and neck cancer, chemotherapy, radiation, registry.

At the time of diagnosis, the majority of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) present with
locoregionally advanced disease in which the cure rate with surgery or radiation alone is achievable but many would consider inadequate. Combined modality treatment with systemic agents and radiation is a potential treatment option for
these patients. Randomized phase 3 studies have demonstrated the superiority of radiation therapy plus concurrent cisplatin (100 mg/m2 on Days 1, 22, and 43) compared with radiation alone in the treatment of unresectable locally advanced
HNSCC and for organ preservation or postoperative adjuvant therapy in the presence of high-risk pathologic features,
particularly positive margins or extranodal extension.1-4 The use of radiation therapy plus concurrent antiepidermal
growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody, cetuximab, has also demonstrated improved outcomes for patients with
locally advanced HNSCC compared with radiation alone.5 Emerging data with induction and sequential chemotherapy
regimens have shown promising results, but have also served to add to the confusion regarding the optimal treatment
approach for patients with locally advanced HNSCC.6,7 Availability of new radiation techniques and altered fractionation
schedules offer further advancements for patients, but can further complicate decision making regarding selection of systemic therapy.8-10
In the routine management of locally advanced HNSCC, it is uncertain to which degree oncologists adhere to evidenced-based practices such as defined by randomized controlled phase 3 studies (level 1 evidence) or by category 1-based

National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. No
large-scale databases are available that have accurately
tracked information regarding chemotherapy utilization
in conjunction with radiation for locally advanced
HNSCC. Such data are pertinent to the design of future
clinical trials, but are also critical to gain understanding as
to the impact of the results of important clinical trials
upon the routine management of HNSCC.
LORHAN (Longitudinal Oncology Registry of
Head and Neck) is a prospective national registry
designed to examine patterns of care of head and neck
cancer patients in the United States. The LORHAN database collects baseline disease-specific information and
treatment data including chemotherapy and radiation
therapy, from community as well as academic practices.
We conducted the following analysis of the LORHAN
database to examine current practice patterns of US physicians who prescribed chemotherapy in conjunction with
radiation therapy for newly diagnosed HNSCC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
The LORHAN database was started in 2005. Patients eligible for enrollment into the registry must have had a new
diagnosis of cytologically or histologically confirmed carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx,
nasopharynx, larynx, or neck lymph node metastasis from
an occult primary tumor. Patients must have been a candidate for chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy at the
time of study registration, be aged 18 years, and have
signed an institutional review board-approved consent.
Patients participating in a therapeutic clinical trial were
eligible for entry in the LORHAN registry.
Data entry in the LORHAN registry was electronic,
incorporating encrypted point-to-point data transfer via
secure HTTP protocols. For patients who received
chemotherapy, data were collected regarding type of
chemotherapy, dose, number of cycles, and timing of
chemotherapy with respect to radiation and surgery.
Other core baseline data collected for the registry included
demographics, clinical characteristics, radiation treatment. Data forms were collected at predesignated time
points: at baseline, after completion of initial treatment, 1
year, 2 years, 3 years, and/or at the time of disease progression, relapse, or development of a new primary cancer.
Entry of data from each time point was locked only after
reviewed for accuracy by the investigator at the institutional site. Compensation to centers was provided on a

1680

per case basis to cover regulatory fees, personnel, and data
management costs. Payment was dispensed in increments
after locking of data at predesignated time points.
Participating institutions were self-designated as
being community practice or academic centers. Patients
from 103 participating institutions (22 academic, 81
community), with broad representation of all geographic
regions of the United States, were enrolled in the
LORHAN registry between December 1, 2005 and May
11, 2009. Patients were included in this analysis if they
had completed and locked baseline and initial therapy
forms. Patients included in the present analysis must also
have received systemic therapy (including classic cytotoxic
drugs or biologic targeted agents) in conjunction with definitive radiation therapy.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses used chi-square, t test, and other nonparametric tests as appropriate, for 2 sample comparisons.
All tests were performed under a 2-sided null hypothesis
with a 2-tailed P value of .05 to reject the null. All analyses were performed using R (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing), version 2.11.0 or greater.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
At the time of analysis, 2874 patients were registered in
the LORHAN database, of whom 2363 patients had
locked baseline assessments and 1747 patients had completed and locked initial therapy forms. Characteristics of
patients with locked baseline assessments are shown in Table 1 for all patients and subdivided by type of institution
in which patients were treated—academic or communitybased. Participating institutions have enrolled patients
from 35 states, representing all major regions of the
United States. More patients (n ¼ 1009) were registered
from academic institutions than from community practice sites (n ¼ 738).
Distribution of Treatment Modalities
A total of 1617 (93%) patients received radiation as a
component of their therapy regimen; 468 (27%) patients
received radiation therapy alone or surgery followed by
radiation therapy. Of the 1144 (65%) patients who
received chemotherapy in conjunction with radiotherapy,
645 (56%) patients received chemotherapy concurrent
with radiation therapy, 49 (4%) patients received chemotherapy before radiotherapy (induction), 224 (20%)
patients received chemotherapy before and during

radiotherapy (sequential), and 226 (20%) patients
received chemoradiation after surgery (see Table 2). To
examine differences in the pattern of utilization of these
treatment modalities between academic and community
practices, relative uses of each modality within each group
were compared. No differences were observed in the relative
frequency of use of concurrent chemoradiation or sequential
chemotherapy. Overall, induction chemoradiation was not
frequently used but was disproportionately more commonly
used in the community setting (P ¼ .046).
Chemotherapy Regimens
Table 3 shows initial prescribed regimens for patients who
received systemic treatment in conjunction with radiation. For patients who received radiation therapy with

Cancer

concurrent systemic therapy, cisplatin alone was the most
commonly prescribed regimen and was more commonly
used in the academic setting compared with the community setting (P ¼ .0015). Of patients who received singleagent cisplatin, approximately 15% received a weekly dosing schedule of cisplatin (data not shown). The next most
common regimens were single-agent cetuximab, followed
by carboplatin plus paclitaxel; no intergroup differences
were observed with respect to the use of these regimens
between institution type.
When chemotherapy was used before radiation
therapy (for induction or sequential treatment) the most
common regimens, in descending order, were: cisplatin,
5-fluorouracil, plus docetaxel; cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil,
docetaxel, plus cetuximab; and cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil,

To examine whether specific patient characteristics
influence the selection of concurrent chemotherapy, we

Cisplatin, relative to cetuximab, was more commonly prescribed in patients with nasopharyngeal cancer.
To examine factors associated with tolerability of
concurrent systemic therapy, a logistic regression analysis
of characteristics associated with dose reduction of either
cisplatin or cetuximab was performed. Overall, no difference in the rate of dose reductions was observed between
single-agent cisplatin and single-agent cetuximab (data
not shown). As shown in Table 5, for patients receiving
either cisplatin or cetuximab, chemotherapy dose reductions were less frequent in patients treated in the community setting, and in patients who were treated on a clinical
trial. In patients with Zubrod PS 3, systemic therapy
dose reductions were significantly more common.

Postoperative Adjuvant Therapy
Table 6, presents the distribution of treatment by center
type, among patients who received postoperative adjuvant
therapy (n ¼ 364). The use of chemoradiation was
higher in the academic setting at 66% as compared with
56% in the community setting, Correspondingly, the
use of radiation alone was higher in the community setting at 34% as compared with 46% in the academic setting (Table 6; P value ¼ .0179). We examined systemic
agents used concurrently with radiation after surgery.
As shown in Table 7, only single-agent cisplatin or
cetuximab was commonly used in concurrent chemotherapy regimens. In comparison, cisplatin was more
commonly used at academic centers than in community

centers, whereas, with respect to cetuximab use, no difference was observed based on center type.

DISCUSSION
In the present study we used a nationwide, prospective,
head and neck cancer database to analyze the current practice patterns of US oncologists with respect to utilization
of systemic therapy in conjunction with radiation therapy
for head and neck cancer. Unlike other available databases, the LORHAN registry collects patient data prospectively from the time of the initiation of definitive
therapy. In contrast, Surveillance, Epidemiology and End
Results (SEER) and National Cancer Database do not
track detailed information regarding radiation, chemotherapy drugs, supportive care, and outcomes. Hospital
and pharmacy data can be used to examine utilization of
chemotherapy, but not in a disease-specific manner or in a
way such that chemotherapy use, delivered concurrent
with radiation, can be captured. Likewise, the data from
SEER and National Cancer Database are limited by lacking association of specific treatment data with detailed disease-specific clinical information. Increasing availability
of the electronic medical documentation with integrated
chemotherapy order entry software holds the promise of
disease-specific data extraction and outcomes analysis.
However, retrospective data extraction from the electronic
medical record is severely limited because of the incompleteness of data. Furthermore, wide scale multi-institutional analysis is hampered by the use of multiple software
platforms that further magnify the problem of inhomogeneous data collection. The prospective design and careful
selection of predesignated data fields of the LORHAN
database overcome these pitfalls and permit the usefulness
of the data.
Identification of patient subgroups that are more
likely to achieve maximal benefit from concurrent chemoradiation versus from induction/sequential chemoradiation has not been well defined in the literature.
Considerable controversy presently exists regarding the
relative benefits of concurrent cisplatin-based chemoradiation versus induction or sequential therapy.11 Two
large phase 3 clinical trials using induction and sequential
have recently been reported.6,7 However, these trials only
compared the effectiveness of specific induction chemotherapy regimens, and did not examine the inherent value
of induction chemotherapy versus no induction. The
existing data from large phase 3 studies supports the
notion that concurrent cisplatin-based chemoradiation is

1684

superior to radiation alone and represents the highest
level of evidence for management of locally advanced
HNSCC.1-4 It has been speculated that the use of induction chemotherapy has proliferated in the routine management of locally advanced HNSCC, despite lack of
randomized, controlled phase 3 studies (level I evidence)
directly comparing induction (or sequential) therapy
versus concurrent chemoradiation. Our analysis confirms
this impression. Furthermore, because the LORHAN
registry is ongoing, we will be able to compare future
trends with past patterns of induction/sequential therapy
use such that, for instance, the impact of future phase 3
studies can be assessed.
Level I evidence supports the use of concurrent cisplatin as well as concurrent cetuximab; we show also the
frequent use of other concurrent chemotherapy regimens,
for which only lower level of supporting evidence exists.
The vast majority of patients (80%) in the registry had
optimal PS with Zubrod scores 1. However, approximately 20% of registered patients had suboptimal PS
(Zubrod 2), which in part may explain the use of potentially less intensive, and less well studied, concurrent regimens. Forty-eight percent of LORHAN registry patients
(excluding nasopharynx, salivary, unknown primary, and
sinus cancer cases) had oropharyngeal carcinoma. Based
upon studies that have examined human papillomavirus
(HPV) in squamous cell carcinoma, showing that approximately 60% of oropharyngeal carcinomas are associated
with HPV, we can estimate that as much as 30% of registry patients may have HPV-related disease.12 We speculate that physician preference for using noncisplatin
regimens may result as an attempt to tailor less toxic treatment to this more favorable prognostic group. The
LORHAN registry tracks data as to whether HPV testing
is performed. It will therefore be possible to test this
hypothesis as the use of HPV testing becomes more
widespread.
Two phase 3 studies have demonstrated the superiority of postoperative concurrent cisplatin plus radiation
therapy compared with postoperative radiation alone.3,4
Combined analysis of these trials, EORTC 22931 and
RTOG-Intergroup trial 9501, identified poor prognostic
factors that enable prediction of patients most likely to
benefit from postoperative chemoradiation.13 We
observed that in academic centers, compared with community centers, postoperative chemoradiation was more
frequently used than postoperative radiation alone. Definitive conclusions regarding this observation are limited
because of the lack of other information (such as

Cancer

Analysis of Chemo-RT for HNSCC in the US/Wong et al

extracapsular lymph node extension or surgical tumor
margin status) that would allow further analysis. However, we can speculate that this observation may be
because of more high-risk patients referred to academic
centers for surgical therapy. Alternatively, it is possible
that high-risk patients are proportionately equally represented in the community setting, but that the pattern of
practice is divergent from evidence-based guidelines such
as category 1 National Comprehensive Cancer Network
guidelines.14 Finally, the gain achieved with chemoradiation over radiation alone in the postoperative setting is
modest, and comes at the cost of increased toxicity profiles. It may be that concerns about toxicity, as well as the
expertise of centers to nurture patients through challenging treatment regimens, influence the use of combined
regimens at various centers.
Although the information presented here provides
a representation of the current pattern of utilization
of chemotherapy for the multimodality management of
head and neck cancer in the United States, we recognize
the limitations of these data. Academic and community
practice centers that voluntarily agreed to participate in
the LORHAN registry may have done so as a result of a
particular interest or expertise in the field of head and
neck oncology. Therefore, it is conceivable that the database may reflect biases in practice patterns that may not
necessarily be representative of the general US oncology
community. It is also possible that some participating centers were selective in the decision to register qualifying
patients; however, it is likely that this potential bias is
diluted given the large number of patients and participating centers in the registry. An ideal head and neck cancer
registry would include all HNSCC patients rather than
selected patients who meet eligibility criteria; this is however not practical. For the purpose of this study, it is not
necessary for each participating center to enroll every
patient to gauge their pattern of practice. Compared with
SEER or National Cancer Database, it is plausible that
the LORHAN registry may not accurately reflect the demographic features of the US head and neck cancer
patient population. However, detailed demographic information was captured in the LORHAN registry and
appears to be consistent with other head and neck cancer
demographic reports. Comprehensive analysis of demographic data and association with clinical outcome will be
the subject of future inquiry and is beyond this scope of
this report.
In summary, we report, to our knowledge, the first
broad snapshot of the practice patterns of US oncologists

regarding the utilization of systemic therapy in conjunction with radiation and/or surgery for locally advanced
HNSCC. We show that cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiation is the most frequently used regimen, and that
concurrent cetuximab plus radiation is the next most
commonly used regimen; both regimens are consistent
with category 1 level of evidence in National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.14 A substantial proportion of patients in the United States receive induction or
sequential chemoradiation for locally advanced HNSCC
despite a lower level of evidence to support their use. We
conclude that the LORHAN database is a useful tool to
gauge current practice patterns and will be valuable in the
future for comparison of evolving trends of the combined
modality management of head and neck cancer. The data
presented here may contribute to the design of future clinical trials. Moreover, the impact of major clinical trials
may also be assessed using this prospective database.
