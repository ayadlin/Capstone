ABSTRACT:

Selenium compounds are known as cancer preventive agents and are also able to
ameliorate the toxicity associated with anti-cancer radiation and chemotherapy in
mouse models. Sensitivity to the toxicity of chemotherapy is also modulated by the
circadian clock, molecular time-keeping system that underlie daily fluctuations in
multiple physiological and biochemical processes. Here we show that these two
mechanisms are interconnected. By screening a library of small molecules in a cellbased reporter system, we identified L-methyl-selenocysteine as a positive regulator
of the core clock protein, BMAL1. L-methyl-selenocysteine up-regulates BMAL1 at the
transcriptional level both in cultured cells and in mice. We also show that in tissue
culture selenium exerts its action by interfering with TIEG1-mediated repression
of Bmal1 promoter. Selenium treatment fails to protect BMAL1-deficient mice from
toxicity induced by the chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide but does protect
Clock mutant mice deficient in circadian rhythm control but having normal BMAL1.
These findings define selenium as circadian modulator and indicate that the tissue
protective effect of selenium results, at least in part, from up-regulation of BMAL1
expression and subsequent enhancement of CLOCK/BMAL1-mediated transcription.

INTRODUCTION

been extensively investigated and multiple mechanisms
have been proposed, suggesting that the biological
effects of this compound are likely highly pleiotropic.
Traditionally, many aspects of selenium action have
been attributed to its anti-oxidant activity. In the form of
selenocysteine, it is incorporated into several anti-oxidant
enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin
reductases, which are important for regulating the balance
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in an organism [7].
More recently, several aspects of selenium action have
been linked to both positive and negative regulation
of transcription factors that are involved in control of
normal cellular proliferation and cellular responses to

Selenium is an essential trace element of fundamental
importance to human health due to its anti-oxidant, antiinflammatory and anti-viral activities [1]. Various forms
of selenium (both organic and inorganic) have been
shown to have chemopreventive effects in a variety of
malignancies, including breast and prostate cancer [2, 3].
An organic form of selenium, L-methyl-selenocysteine
(MSC), acts as a selective modulator of the therapeutic
efficacy and systemic toxicity of anticancer drugs in a
variety of human tumor xenograft models [4-6].

stress conditions, such as NFκB, Sp1 and Sp3 [8], HIF1α [4] and p53 [9]. Taken together, these data imply that
selenium may modulate various pathways and that this
regulation is likely to be tissue-specific.
Many aspects of mammalian physiology are
controlled by the activity of components of the circadian
clock (reviewed in [10]. This evolutionarily conserved
system is comprised of a network of transcriptional
and translational feedback loops that drive 24-hr-based
oscillations in RNA and protein abundance of key clock
components [11, 12]. This, in turn, translates into 24-hr
periodicity in expression of a large number of output genes
[13]. The molecular mechanism of circadian oscillation is
operative in virtually all mammalian tissues and thereby
influences a wide range of physiological and metabolic
processes in a tissue-specific manner [14].
One of the important processes that are modulated
by the circadian clock is an organism’s response to
genotoxic stress, such as that induced by anticancer drug
and radiation treatments. Previously, using circadian
mice deficient in different components of the circadian
clock, we established a molecular link between the
functional status of the major circadian CLOCK/BMAL1
transcriptional complex and the sensitivity of normal
tissues to toxicity induced by the chemotherapeutic agent
cyclophosphamide (CY) [15]. These data, together with
our more recent work [16, 17], allowed us to define
circadian transcriptional activators as potential targets for
pharmacological modulation aimed at protecting normal
tissues from damage induced by genotoxic treatments.
Here we report that selenium up-regulates the core
circadian protein, BMAL1, by relieving the GC-box/
TIEG1-mediated repression of Bmal1 promoter The in
vivo effect of selenium was found to be tissue-specific in

RESULTS
A cell-based readout system reveals selenium
compound as a circadian clock modulator
Our previous studies identified CLOCK/BMAL1
transcriptional activity as a target for pharmacological
intervention to, among other potential applications,
reduce the toxicity associated with genotoxic anti-cancer
treatments [16]. To identify small molecules capable
of modulating CLOCK/BMAL1 activity, we designed
a readout system based on mouse fibrosarcoma L929
cells expressing high levels of endogenous CLOCK and
BMAL1, positive regulators circadian transcriptional
machinery, transduced with Per1-driven luciferase
reporter construct (L929-Per1) [18]. By screening a
chemical library of known pharmacological agents
(LOPAC, Sigma, 1280 compounds total) in this system,
we identified 14 inhibitors and 17 activators of Per1
promoter as our major hits (Supplementary Tables 1 and

that selenium-induced changes in BMAL1 were detected
in the liver, but not in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN),
the central pacemaker of the circadian system. Consistent
with this tissue-specificity, systemic administration of
selenium did not affect circadian behavioral parameters;
however, it did result in a significant increase in animals’
resistance to toxicity induced by the chemotherapeutic
agent, cyclophosphamide. These data reveal novel
mechanisms of selenium action that are linked to
regulation of the core clock components.

acid (MSA, a form of MSC optimized for in vitro studies)
showed that treatment with MSA specifically induced
an increase in Per1-driven luciferase activity in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 1A). A significant increase in
reporter signal can be detected as early as 6 hrs after MSA
treatment reaching its maximum at 18 hrs post incubation
(Fig. 1B). This promoter induction is reversible, as after
removal of MSA, activity of Per1-driven luciferase
remained high for ~6 hrs, after which it returned to its
basal level within ~ 24 hrs (Fig. 1C).

of our screening approach. Other compounds from this
list, however, have not been previously linked to circadian
function. Thus, among the chemicals identified as potent
upregulators of Per1 promoter we were intrigued to find
an organic selenium compound, L-methyl selenocysteine

by MSA suggested that selenium may exert its effect at the
level of transcriptional activation. To determine which of
the clock genes could be targeted by selenium, we tested
the affect of MSA on basal promoter activity of Clock,
Bmal1, Per1, Per2 and Cry1 genes using a luciferase
reporter assay. Of all the promoters tested, only Per1
and Bmal1 were up-regulated by MSA, with the Bmal1
promoter showing the highest fold of activation (Fig. 2A).
MSA-induced activation of Bmal1 gene transcription
was confirmed by measuring levels of corresponding
endogenous Bmal1 mRNA in L929 cells at different
times after MSA treatment (Fig. 2B). The peak time of
RNA expression (4 hrs after incubation with MSA) is
tightly coupled with increase in BMAL1 protein (Fig.
2C), whereas kinetics of modest increase in PER1 protein
suggests that it is dependent on the activation of BMAL1
(Fig. 2C). Consistent with this, suppression of BMAL1
by specific siRNA completely blocked the stimulatory
effect of MSA on CLOCK/BMAL1-driven activation
of the Per1 promoter (Fig.2D). The abundance of other
clock transcripts and proteins including CLOCK, PER2,

A.

CRY1 and CRY2 was not affected by MSA (data not
shown). Together, these data suggest that MSA-induced
activation of the Per1 promoter results from up-regulating
the Bmal1 gene followed by an increase in abundance and
presumably activity of the corresponding protein.

The effects of selenium on BMAL1 are mediated
through transcriptional repressor TIEG1
Since our results in tissue culture demonstrated
that MSA activates the Bmal1 promoter, we sought to
determine the region important for this regulation. It has
been previously reported, that Bmal1 is regulated by two
transcription factors REV-ERBα (transcription repressor)
and RORα (transcription activator) competing for the
same RORE element in its promoter region [24-27]. More
recently, the glucose-inducible gene Tieg1, which encodes
an Sp1 family transcription repressor, was identified as
another important regulator of Bmal1 transcription. The
Sp1 and Sp1-like transcription factors have been linked

the putative core promoter of the mBmal1 gene.  The transcription start site of ORF is designated +1. Potential TIEG1 binding sites are
underlined. The Bmal1 promoter fragments used (Bmal1-61 and Bmal1-17) are indicated by bold number above the truncation sites (-17 and

one of three Bmal1 promoter fragmented reporter genes (816bp, 61bp, or 17bp upstream from +1bp transcription start site). 18hour post
transfection cells were treated with or without indicated concentrations of selenium (MSA) and harvested 9 hours later to be analyzed for
luciferase expression. (C). Selenium-mediated up-regulation of Bmal1 gene is compromised in a promoter lacking the two most proximal
TIEG1 sites. Bmal1-816 was used as a template to generate a promoter lacking the two proximal TIEG1-sites, which were previously
determined to be responsible for Bmal1 gene repression [32]. The primer used in the site-directed mutagenesis is shown below the two
TIEG1 proximal sites, and the specific mutated base pairs are shown in red. Cells were transfected with either wild-type Bmal1-816 reporter

and probed with anti-BMAL1 antibody. Each lane represents tissue lysate obtained from an individual animal. Actin was used to control

secondary antibody (red). DAPI (blue) was used to stain the nuclei of all cells. SCN sections obtained from untreated Bmal1-/- mice are

to the regulation of several genes by selenium [28-30].
The mechanism of selenium regulation has not been
elucidated, but is likely to involve regulation of zincfinger DNA binding. Previous analysis of the Bmal1
promoter revealed three potential Sp1 binding sites in
proximity to the transcription initiation site [31]; and
of these three sites, the two most proximal Sp1-binding
sites were shown to bind TIEG1 and repress Bmal1 gene
promoter [32](Fig. 3A). To test whether selenium might
inhibit TIEG1 binding to these proximal Sp1-binding sites,
truncated Bmal1 promoters that included the two most
proximal TIEG1-binding sites (Bmal1-816 and Bmal161) and one that excluded TIEG-binding site (Bmal1-17)
were used in a luciferase transcription assay. MSA was
shown to upregulate Bmal1 promoters that included the
proximal TIEG1-sites and MSA effect was ablated with
a Bmal1 promoter lacking the proximal TIEG1 sites (Fig.
3B). To further confirm the importance of the proximal
TIEG1 repressor binding sites in MSA effect on Bmal1
expression, the Bmal1-816 plasmid construct was used
as a template in site-directed mutagenesis to generate
specific point mutations of the proximal TIEG1 sites
using the primer depicted in Figure 3A. The Bmal1
promoter lacking the two most proximal TIEG1 sites
was compromised for MSA-induction (Fig. 3C). We
next asked whether the circadian regulated TIEG1 might
overcome the upregulation of Bmal1 promoter by MSA.
Cells were co-transfected with Bmal1-816bp reporter
gene and empty vector or increasing amounts of TIEG1
expression plasmid. The transcriptional luciferase results
clearly show that high levels of ectopic TIEG1 represses
Bmal1 expression even in the presence of MSA (Fig. 3D).
These data suggest that selenium mediates its effects on
Bmal1 expression at least in part through the two most
proximal TIEG1 elements.

for normal circadian variations in BMAL1 levels in the
liver, tissue samples were collected at two time points,
ZT04 and ZT10. Similar to acute induction in response to
a single administration, systemic administration caused a
significant increase in BMAL1 protein levels in the liver
at both times tested (Fig. 4C-F). At the same time, despite
the ability of selenium to cross the blood-brain barrier
[33], no increase in BMAL1 immunoreactivity was
detected in the SCN of animals fed with MSC compared
to animals fed with PBS (Fig. 4G) independent of time of
brain collection.
The BMAL1 abundance in the liver directly correlated
with the amount of selenium when it was administered
as a dietary supplement in the form of sodium selenite
(Fig. 4H,I). These diet-associated differences correlated
with the levels of Per1 mRNA expression measured at
its normal peak time at ZT10 (Fig. 4J). Consistent with
the lack of selenium effect on the abundance of BMAL1
in the SCN, circadian behavioral parameters were not
affected by the type of diet (Fig. S1, Table S3). These
data suggest that selenium affects the level and activity
of BMAL1 in a tissue-specific manner and that seleniummediated regulation of BMAL1 may play an important
physiological role in liver-specific processes.

Selenium treatment ameliorates toxicity induced
by the chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide
in vivo
Previously, we showed that sensitivity to the
chemotherapeutic drug CY is modulated by the functional
status of the CLOCK/BMAL1 transcriptional complex
and that animals deficient in positive components of the
molecular clock (Clock mutant and Bmal1-/- knockout
mice) demonstrated enhanced sensitivity to CY-induced
toxicity [15]. These data, together with the known ability
of selenium to reduce chemotherapy-associated toxicity
and our finding that selenium can modulate CLOCK/
BMAL1 activity via up-regulation of BMAL1, prompted
us to test whether selenium could rescue CY-sensitive
circadian mutant mice from drug-induced toxicity. To
test this hypothesis, we administered MSC to wild type,
Clock/Clock mutant and Bmal1-/- knockout mice that
received CY according to a previously described schedule
[5, 15]. As expected, Clock/Clock and Bmal1-/- mice
were significantly more sensitive to CY-induced toxicity
manifested by severe hematopoietic syndrome. Selenium
administration alleviated CY-induced toxicity in Clock/
Clock mice, bringing both the survival rate (Fig. 5A) and
number of circulating lymphocytes (Fig. 5B) to levels
comparable to those of wild type animals. The rescuing
effect correlated with an increase in BMAL1 protein
levels in the livers of Clock mutant mice (Fig. 5D). In
contrast, mice with genetic disruption of the Bmal1 gene
were non-responsive to rescuing effect of selenium as both

Selenium administration increases the abundance
of the BMAL1 protein in vivo
To test whether selenium has a similar stimulatory
effect and kinetics on BMAL1 protein in vivo as observed
in culture, we administered it in the form of MSC to mice
as a single i.p. injection (10 mg/kg). The injection was
performed at ZT03, when Bmal1 expression is normally
at its lower daily levels and livers were collected 1hr and
3hrs post injection. Similar to our results obtained in tissue
culture, selenium administration caused a significant
increase in Bmal1 RNA (Fig. 4A) and protein (Fig. 4B).
Next, we tested whether this increase could be induced
by prolonged systemic administration of selenium. For
this, we administered MSC via gavage daily for a period
of 2 weeks, and measured levels of BMAL1 protein in
two tissues: the liver, which is the major metabolic tissue
with prominent circadian regulation, and in neurons of the
SCN, the site of the mammalian master clock. To account

kinetics of mortality and loss of circulating lymphocytes
following the CY exposure (Fig. 5A,C) These data
confirm that the rescuing effect of selenium in vivo is
mediated, to a large extend, through BMAL1. The ability

indicate days of CY injection. Treatment with MSC dramatically increased the 25-day survival rate of CY-treated Clock/Clock mice but had
no effect on survival of Bmal1 knockout animals. The experiment was performed three times with similar results. (B) Selenium treatment
decreases CY-induced neutropenia and leukocytopenia. Total white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils (Neut) and lymphocyte (Lymph) counts
in peripheral blood of wild type and Clock mutant mice treated with PBS or MSC and CY as described for Fig. 5A. MSC-induced increase
in survival of CY-treated Clock mutant mice correlates with significant increase in the number of circulating lymphocytes (Student’s t-test
p=0.015, n=5/group). (C) Selenium has no effect on the number of circulating lymphocytes in CY-treated Bmal1-/- mice. Mice were treated
with PBS or MSC and CY as described in Fig. 5A. The cell count data are mean values for 8 mice. Please note that absolute values cannot
be directly compared between the Clock/Clock (Fig. 4A) and Bmal1-/- mice since the experiments were not performed simultaneously. (D)
Selenium administration increases BMAL1 protein abundance in the livers of Clock/Clock mice. Western blot analysis of liver extracts of
five individual Clock/Clock mice fed with either PBS or MSC with anti-BMAL1 and anti-CLOCK antibodies. No effect on CLOCK-∆19
expression level was detected. (E) Selenium increases CLOCK-Δ19/BMAL1-mediated activation of a responsive promoter. HEK293T
cells were transfected with Per1-Luciferase reporter, HA-BMAL1 and either full-length wild type CLOCK or deletion mutant CLOCK
(CLOCK-Δ19) and treated with indicated concentrations of MSA. Luciferase activity of cell lysates was normalized with β-Gal. Bars
represent mean values ± standard error. Asterisk indicate statistically significant increase in promoter activation; *p=0.0011, **p=0.0012

Together, these results suggest that selenium ameliorates
CY-induced toxicity via its stimulatory effect on BMAL1
resulting in upregulation of CLOCK/BMAL1-mediated
expression of target genes critical for survival/recovery of
hematopoietic cells in the face of genotoxic stress.

effect on SCN-governed rhythms in locomotor activity.
It is important to note that the lack of systemic effect of
selenium on circadian rhythmicity presents an advantage
from the therapeutic standpoint, as it allows for modulation
of response to genotoxic treatments in a tissue-specific
manner without disturbing the central clock.
Tissue specificity of the observed effects may also
be the underlying reason for the selectivity of seleniummediated protection for normal, as opposed to tumor,
tissues. Testing of a large panel of tumor cell lines and
animal tumor models would be needed to determine how
universal the selectivity of BMAL1-mediated protective
effects towards normal tissues is. Quite interestingly,
recent reports demonstrated that in mammary gland,
selenium administration induces upregulation of another
circadian protein, PER2, in a BMAL1-independent
manner [39, 40] and that this upregulation may underlie
tumor preventive properties of selenium compounds. Thus,
both cytoprotective and chemopreventive functions of
selenium are likely to be exerted through the components
of the molecular clock in a tissue-specific manner and
presumably via different mechanisms.
Additional work is needed to fully understand the
mechanism, by which the increase in CLOCK/BMAL1
activity ameliorates CY-induced toxicity. Our previous
work has suggested that CLOCK/BMAL1-dependent
modulation of the lymphocyte survival/recovery rate is an
important factor in determining the in vivo drug response
and survival in clinical therapy [15]. Consistent with this,
studies with Bmal1-/- mice revealed the involvement
of BMAL1 in differentiation of pre-B to mature B cells
although direct molecular targets are still not known [41].
Another potential mechanism may involve BMAL1dependent regulation of ROS homeostasis [42], which
would protect against their excessive accumulation in
response to genotoxic stress and thereby ameliorate
drug-induced tissue damage. However, regardless of a
precise molecular mechanism, the reported here ability of
selenium to modulate activity of circadian transcriptional
complex without affecting central clock, opens new
possibilities for clinical applications. If previously we
considered clock-targeting pharmaceuticals mostly as
resetting agents (with the goal to reset molecular clocks
in drug- and radiation-sensitive tissues to times of
higher resistance to genotoxic treatment), now we have
a compound capable of minimizing the damaging effects
of genotoxic treatments by constant up regulation of
circadian transcriptional activators in a tissue-specific
manner. Since selenium is an essential trace element that
is approved for clinical use it should be considered in
clinical trials as chemo- and radiotherapy adjuvant.

DISCUSSION
Cancer treatment involves frequent use of highly
toxic compounds that commonly induce severe adverse
effects reducing efficacy of therapy, creating risks of
acquisition of additional diseases and reducing quality
of life of cancer patients. That is why development of
new therapeutic approaches allowing overcoming side
effects of chemotherapy and radiation is highly desirable.
In this respect, the components of the molecular clock
are attractive therapeutic targets: they are ubiquitously
expressed in virtually all tissues including those that
determine an organism’s sensitivity to genotoxic
treatments and more experimental evidence suggest that
key circadian proteins can directly or indirectly modulate
stress response pathways [17].
High-throughput screening of libraries of small
organic molecules is one of the main tools for the discovery
of bioactive compounds. This approach was successfully
used recently to identify chemical compounds affecting
basic circadian parameters (circadian period, amplitude
and phase of rhythmicity) in circadian-synchronized cells
[35, 36]. We reached similar goals using non-synchronized
readout system that enabled selection of compounds
modulating average level of activity of circadian
transcriptional machinery revealed by the expression
of the reporter driven by CLOCK/BMAL1-dependent
circadian promoter. To our surprise, this screening
approach identifies organic selenium compounds as potent
up-regulators of Per1 promoter.
Selenium is an essential trace element that has
two major clinical applications: tumor prevention and
protection against DNA damage induced by anti-cancer
therapy. Studies in cell-based model systems as well as
several clinical trials have conclusively demonstrated
that selenium supplementation ameliorates radiationinduced mucositis in mice treated with fractionated doses
of ionizing radiation [37] as well as radiation-induced
diarrhea in treatment of patients with cervical and uterine
cancers [38]. Our findings provide a plausible mechanism
behind tissue protective effects of selenium by linking
it to circadian regulation of gene expression. This study
suggests that selenium is capable of tuning circadian
transcriptional machinery to the higher activity associated
with maximum resistance by upregulating BMAL1
expression.
Our data, as well as other reports [39, 40], show
the effect of selenium to be highly tissue-specific.
Thus, no changes in BMAL1 levels were detected in
the SCN; accordingly, selenium administration has no

and

library

Screening conditions were optimized by testing the
assay for temporal and spatial signal variability using
several 96-well plates as described in [18]. Luciferase
readings of untreated cells (constant high luciferase
signal) and cells treated with Actinomycin D (background
signal) were used to calculate Z-factor using the equation:

Animals
Female Clock mutant mice [43-45] were backcrossed
to C57BL/6J mice for 19 generations. Female Bmal1
-/mice [46] were backcrossed to C57BL/6J for 13
generations. Animals of 8-10 weeks old were synchronized
to a 12h light: 12h dark cycle (LD 12:12) for at least 2
weeks before the experiment. Animals received selenium
in the form of MSC either through a single i.p. injection
at 10mg/kg or by gavage (once a day at ZT10) for 14
days at 7.5mg/kg daily [5]. For long-term experiments,
selenium was administered with selenium supplemented
diet (Harlan TD.01652; 3ppm of selenium) in the form
of selenium selenite. Control animals received either
regular (0.1ppm of selenium, TD.96363) or seleniumdeficient diet (<0.01ppm; TD.92163). To assess acute
effects of selenium on clock genes expression, tissue
samples were collected 1 hr and 3 hrs after a single i.p.
injection. In long-term experiments, tissue samples were
collected after 14-days of MSC administration at two
time points, ZT04 and ZT10. In all experiments tissue
samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at -800 C until RNA and protein extraction. When
MSC administration was combined with CY treatment,
intraperitoneal injections of CY (150 mg/kg) were done
at days 8, 10 and 12 as described previously [15]. CYinduced toxicity was assessed by mortality and body
weight loss. The loss of 20% of the original body weight
was considered an endpoint of the experiment. All animal
studies were conducted in accordance with the regulations
of the Committee on Animal Care and Use at the Roswell
Park Cancer Institute.

[49].
Absence of spatial (edge effects) and temporal artifacts
and Z-factor between 0.6 and 0.8 validated the assay.
For screening, cells were plated onto the white
clear-bottom 96-well tissue culture plates at 3x104/well
in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS without phenolred. JANUS automated liquid handling system (Perkin
Elmer) equipped with pin tool (V&P Scientific, Inc) was
used to deliver 100-120 nl of each of 1280 compounds
present in LOPAC library to the 96-well assay plates.
Luciferase activity was measured in 24-30 hrs after
compound delivery using Bright-Glo Luciferase assay
system and GloMax luminometer (Promega) according
to manufacture’s protocol. Every compound that either
reduced or increased the luciferase signal by more than
4 standard deviations was selected as a primary hit.
Primary hits that reduced the luciferase signal were tested
for general toxicity individually using CellTiter-Blue
cell viability kit (Promega) according to manufacturer’s
protocol.

Transient transfection and luciferase reporter
assay
HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected in 24well plates with plasmid DNA (the final DNA amount was
adjusted to 300 ng with pcDNA3 vector) using FuGene
reagents (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
10 ng of pcDNA3-βGal was included for normalization of
transfection efficiency. Cells were collected for analysis
30h after transfection. Luciferase activity was measured
with Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI)
according to manufacturer’s protocol. βGal activity was

for the immunohistochemical detection of BMAL protein
using a standard immunofluorescence technique using
primary antibody against BMAL1 at 1:100 dilution
followed by secondary antibody staining (DyLight594conjugated donkey anti-guinea pig IgG antibody, Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) at
1:400 dilution. Sections were mounted with Prolong Gold
Antifade reagent containing DAPI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) and analyzed with Axio Imager Z1 microsocpe
(Zeiss) equipped with epifluorescence. Images were
collected with Hamamatsu OTCA-R2 digital camera and
AxioVision software.

RNA isolation and real-time PCR analysis
Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using
RNeasy RNA extraction kit (Qiagen). Total RNA was
isolated from livers using TRIZol reagent (Invitrogen)
according to manufacturer’s protocol. TaqMan real-time
RT-PCR was performed using the following ABI premade primers/probes sets:
Clock: Mm00455950-m1
Bmal1: Mm00500226-m1
Per1: Mm00501813-m1
Per2: Mm00478113-m1
Cry1: Mm00514392-m1
Cry2: Mm00546062-m1
Reactions were run on 7500 real-time PCR system
(Applied Biosystems) and relative mRNA abundance was
calculated using the comparative delta-Ct method with
Gapdh mRNA as a standard as previously described [13].

Behavioral analysis
Mice were singly housed in cages equipped with
a running wheel at 12h light:12h dark cycle (LD12:12)
for at least 2 weeks before being released into constant
darkness (DD). Activity data were collected as previously
described [43, 45]. The analyses were performed using
ClockLab software (Actimetrics, Inc, Evanston, IL).

siRNA-mediated suppression of gene expression

Total Blood Cell Analysis

Cells were seeded onto 24-well plates and transfected
with siRNA against clock genes (siGENOME SMART
pool, Dharmacon) according to manufacturer’s protocol.
Reduction in protein levels was evaluated in tissue lysates
collected 72 hrs post transfection by Western blotting with
specific antibody. siGenome non-targeting siRNA was
used as a negative control and Cyclophillin B siRNA was
used as a positive control for efficiency of transfection.

Hematological evaluation of blood composition was
performed two days after the last CY injection. Peripheral
blood obtained from the retroorbital sinus was collected
into EDTA-treated tubes; the complete blood cells counts
with WBC differentials were measured by using Advia
120 hematology system (Bayer) and analyzed with the
software application for C57BL/6J mice. All control
parameters were within the range previously described for
this mouse strain.

Western blot analysis and antibodies

Statistical Analyses

Endogenous CLOCK and BMAL1 were detected
with anti-CLOCK and anti-BMAL1 antibodies raised in
guinea pig (Cocalico Biologicals, Inc., Reamstown, PA)
according to the protocol described in [51]. Anti-actin
antibody was purchased from Sigma (St.Louis, MO).
HRP-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit, anti-mouse and
anti-guinea pig antibodies were purchased form Jackson
Laboratory.

Statistic significance in mRNA and protein levels
was evaluated with Student’s t-test. P values <0.05 were
considered statistically significant.
