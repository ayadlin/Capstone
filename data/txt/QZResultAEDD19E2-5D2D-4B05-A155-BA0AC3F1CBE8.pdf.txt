Abstract
A critical event in the apoptotic cascade is the proteolytic activation of procaspases to active caspases.
The caspase autoactivating compound PAC-1 induces cancer cell apoptosis and exhibits antitumor activity
in murine xenograft models when administered orally as a lipid-based formulation or implanted s.c. as a
cholesterol pellet. However, high doses of PAC-1 were found to induce neurotoxicity, prompting us to
design and assess a novel PAC-1 derivative called S-PAC-1. Similar to PAC-1, S-PAC-1 activated procaspase-3 and induced cancer cell apoptosis. However, S-PAC-1 did not induce neurotoxicity in mice or dogs.
Continuous i.v. infusion of S-PAC-1 in dogs led to a steady-state plasma concentration of ∼10 μmol/L for
24 to 72 hours. In a small efficacy trial of S-PAC-1, evaluation of six pet dogs with lymphoma revealed
that S-PAC-1 was well tolerated and that the treatments induced partial tumor regression or stable disease in four of six subjects. Our results support this canine setting for further evaluation of small-molecule
procaspase-3 activators, including S-PAC-1, a compound that is an excellent candidate for further clinical
evaluation as a novel cancer chemotherapeutic. Cancer Res; 70(18); 7232–41. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Members of the caspase family of cysteine proteases are
key players in both the initiation and execution of apoptosis. These enzymes exist in the cell as low-activity zymogens (proenzymes) that are proteolytically activated to the
mature, highly active enzyme. Most critical to apoptosis is
the proteolytic conversion of procaspase-3 to caspase-3. As
both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways converge to activate procaspase-3, and as caspase-3 has >100
cellular substrates, the activation of procaspase-3 to caspase-3 is a pivotal and committed event in the apoptotic
cascade. Interestingly, procaspase-3 is overexpressed in a
variety of tumor histologies, including breast cancer (1),
colon cancer (2), lung cancer (3), lymphoma (4), neuroblastoma (5), melanoma (6), and liver cancer (7), suggesting
that a small molecule that activates procaspase-3 could
have selectivity for cancer cells versus normal cells.
In 2006, we reported the discovery of a small molecule,
called PAC-1 (Fig. 1A), which enhances procaspase-3 activAuthors' Affiliations: Departments of 1 Biochemistry, 2 Chemistry,

ity in vitro, induces death in cancer cells in culture, and
has efficacy in multiple mouse xenograft models when administered orally as a lipid-based formulation or implanted s.c. as a cholesterol pellet (8). PAC-1 activates
procaspase-3 in vitro through the chelation of inhibitory
zinc ions (9), and derivative synthesis and evaluation reveal that the biological activity of PAC-1 is tied to having
an intact ortho-hydroxy N-acyl hydrazone zinc-chelating
motif (10). Evidence suggests that PAC-1 induces apoptotic death in cancer cells through the chelation of zinc
from procaspase-3, most notably the colocalization of a
fluorescent PAC-1 derivative with sites of cellular caspase-3 activity (10).
As the first procaspase-activating compound, experiments with PAC-1 can begin to define the potential of procaspase-3 activation as a viable anticancer strategy. To
further develop PAC-1 as an experimental therapeutic for
the treatment of cancer in humans, we sought to characterize the effect of this compound when administered i.v.
and in more sophisticated in vivo tumor model systems,
specifically canines with spontaneous cancer. The evaluation of experimental therapeutics in pet dogs with cancer
offers many advantages over murine xenograft models (11).
Herein, we report toxicity studies of i.v. administered PAC-1
in mice, and the discovery of a novel PAC-1 derivative
(called S-PAC-1) that induces apoptosis in cancer cell lines
in culture, is well-tolerated in mice and research dogs, and
has moderate activity in a small trial of canine patients
with spontaneous lymphoma. These results show the feasibility of S-PAC-1 administration to pet dogs with lymphoma as a means to evaluate the therapeutic potential of this
class of compounds.

Canine Clinical Trial with S-PAC-1

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
U-937, Jurkat, SK-MEL-5, HeLa, MDA-MB-231, and EL4
cells were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (authenticated by short tandem repeat analysis)
and maintained at low passage number. Two canine B-cell
lymphoma lines (17-71 and GL-1) were provided by
Dr. Steve Suter (North Carolina State University, Raleigh,
NC). All cultures were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillinstreptomycin and grown at 37°C and 5% CO2. PAC-1 was
synthesized as previously described (8). S-PAC-1 was
synthesized as described in the Supplementary Data.
Ac-DEVD-pNA was synthesized as previously described
(12). Chelex-treated HEPES-NaCl buffer is 50 mmol/L
HEPES and 300 mmol/L NaCl and is treated with Chelex
resin for 1 hour before use.
EGTA fluorescence titration assay
EGTA fluorescence titration assay was performed according to a developed protocol (13) exactly as previously
reported (10).
Recombinant expression, purification, and evaluation
of uncleavable procaspase-3 mutant (D3A)
Procaspase-3 D3A was expressed and purified exactly as
previously reported (10).
Procaspase-3 activation
Recombinantly expressed, zinc-free procaspase-3 D3 A
(7.5 μmol/L) in Chelex-treated HEPES-NaCl was incubated
in the presence of ZnSO4 (10 μmol/L), and the basal activity
was assessed by addition of Ac-DEVD-pNA substrate
(200 μmol/L) and monitored at 405 nm with a SpectraMax
plate reader (Molecular Devices). After the basal activity
was determined, DMSO, PAC-1, or S-PAC-1 was added
to each sample to a final concentration of 50 μmol/L.
Activity of each stock was assessed as described above every
20 minutes. The slope of each data set was used to determine the activity of the protein. Protein activity was normalized to a percent activity at each time point using a
zinc-free sample as 100% activity and the DMSO control
as 0% activity controls.
Apoptosis and cytotoxicity assays
Induction of apoptosis was assessed exactly as previously
reported (10). Cell death IC50 values were assessed by sulforhodamine B assay exactly as previously reported (10) or by
MTS assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol.
Toxicity determinations of PAC-1 and S-PAC-1
PAC-1 and S-PAC-1 were formulated in 2-hydroxypropyl-βcyclodextrin (HPβCD; ref. 14) as described in the Supplementary Data. C57/BL6 mice were administered varying doses of
either PAC-1 or S-PAC-1 via tail vein injection. Mice were
monitored by observation for a period of 24 hours for signs

www.aacrjournals.org

of toxicity, including sensitivity to touch, hypothermia,
hunched posture, agitation, and rapid or depressed breathing.
Pharmacokinetics of S-PAC-1 in healthy research dogs
and dogs with lymphoma
Four healthy male hound dogs weighing at least 30 kg were
used for all preclinical pharmacokinetic studies. All dogs received a single dose of S-PAC-1 via i.v. injection. After a 2week washout period, three dogs received a dosing regimen
predicted to achieve and maintain a steady-state plasma concentration of 10 μmol/L, that is, i.v. S-PAC-1 delivered as a
constant-rate infusion comprising a 10-minute loading dose,
followed by a constant maintenance dose for 24 hours. Dogs
with lymphoma were treated with i.v. S-PAC-1 in a constantrate infusion for either 24 or 72 hours. For all dogs and dosing strategies, blood was drawn from the lateral saphenous
vein and centrifuged, and plasma was stored at −80°C until
analysis.
Toxicologic assessment of S-PAC-1 in healthy
research dogs
Toxicity of S-PAC-1 administration was determined by
serial weekly complete blood counts, serum biochemistry
panels, and animal caregiver gastrointestinal toxicity observational scores adhering to the Veterinary Co-operative
Oncology Group Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (VCOG-CTCAE).
Antitumor assessment of S-PAC-1 in dogs
with lymphoma
Caliper measurement was performed according to the
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
method (15). Briefly, the longest linear length measurement
was recorded for four pairs of peripheral lymph nodes (mandibular, prescapular, inguinal, and popliteal), with the summation of these values giving a RECIST score. In addition to
caliper measurements for all four sets of peripheral lymph
nodes, computed tomography (CT) scans were performed
on the mandibular lymph nodes in every patient, allowing
for accurate and objective measurement of maximal lymph
node linear length.

Results
In vivo toxicity of PAC-1
In an effort to characterize the feasibility and tolerability
of i.v. administered PAC-1, toxicity testing of PAC-1 (when
administered in HPβCD via tail vein injection) was carried
out with C57/BL6 mice and is summarized in Supplementary Table S1. Mice that received PAC-1 exhibited transient
neurotoxicity with onset occurring within 5 minutes of drug
administration and resolution occurring within 2 hours.
Mice that received only the HPβCD vehicle did not exhibit
any clinically observable toxicity. The observed neurotoxicity of PAC-1 in mice did not seem to be species specific, as
grand mal seizure activity in one healthy dog was elicited
when administered 25 mg/kg of PAC-1 as a 5-minute i.v.

infusion. Adverse side effects in this dog were transient and
not life limiting.
Given the known affinity of PAC-1 for zinc in vitro (9), and
the data suggesting that PAC-1 binds cellular zinc (10), we hypothesized that the neurotoxicity observed in mice and dogs
administered PAC-1 in HPβCD was caused by the chelation of
intracellular zinc at N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors within the central nervous system (CNS). This hypothesis
is consistent with data from in vivo studies of other zinc chelators that induce a neurologic phenotype reminiscent of
what we observed with PAC-1 (16, 17). Indeed, in silico analysis of PAC-1 to predict the partitioning across the bloodbrain barrier (BBB; ref. 18) shows that PAC-1 has a calculated
logBB of −0.07. This logBB would correlate to a partitioning
ratio of 1.0:0.85 between the blood and the brain, suggesting
that a significant amount of PAC-1 may be entering the CNS.
Several studies have indicated that chelation of intracellular
zinc stores relieves tonic suppression of NMDA receptors, resulting in neuronal hyperexcitation (17, 19).
Design of S-PAC-1
In an effort to overcome the undesirable side effect of neurotoxicity, we hypothesized that a derivative of PAC-1 that

7234

Cancer Res; 70(18) September 15, 2010

had a lower propensity to cross the BBB would exhibit
decreased neurotoxicity and allow for dosing at higher
concentrations. Based on the structure-activity relationship
previously reported (10), it was predicted that a polar functional group installed on the benzyl ring of PAC-1 should
decrease the predicted logBB while maintaining the activity
of the parent compound. As such S-PAC-1 (Fig. 1A), a sulfonamide derivative of PAC-1, was designed as a compound predicted to have a markedly decreased ability to cross the BBB
(logBB of −1.26, providing a predicted blood/brain ratio of
1.0:0.055). See Supplementary Data for the synthetic route
to S-PAC-1.
S-PAC-1 binds zinc in vitro
The activity of S-PAC-1 was characterized in several
biochemical assays analogous to previously performed PAC1 studies (9, 10). An EGTA competition titration experiment
(13) was used to determine the binding constant for the
S-PAC-1–Zn2+ complex. In the presence of EGTA, the changes
in the fluorescence of the S-PAC-1–Zn2+ complex were used
to plot a formation curve (Fig. 1B). Using the known binding
constant of EGTA, the free zinc concentration can be calculated and used to determine the binding constant of the

S-PAC-1–Zn2+ complex. This complex has a Kd of 46 ± 5 nmol/L
compared with 52 ± 2 nmol/L for PAC-1–Zn2+ (10).
S-PAC-1 activates procaspase-3 in vitro
The ability of S-PAC-1 to activate recombinantly expressed
procaspase-3 in the presence of exogenous zinc was assessed
in vitro. To ensure that the enzymatic activity of the proenzyme was being monitored, a proteolytically uncleavable
mutant of procaspase-3 was used in which the three aspartic
acid cleavage site residues are mutated to alanine (D9A/D28A/
D175A; refs. 9, 20). This uncleavable form of procaspase-3 is
not capable of processing to the mature active caspase-3, thus
ensuring that any increase in activity observed is due to an
increase in the activity of the proenzyme rather than autoproteolysis of the proenzyme. As shown in Fig. 1C, S-PAC-1 rapidly
(within 5 minutes) enhances the enzymatic activity of the
proenzyme by relief of zinc-mediated inhibition, although to
a lesser degree than PAC-1.

and analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 1D). Both PAC-1 and
S-PAC-1 treatment lead to a similar increase in the population of apoptotic cells (Annexin V positive, PI negative).
In an effort to determine an appropriate treatment strategy for the evaluation of S-PAC-1 in vivo, the time dependency
of S-PAC-1 cytotoxicity was evaluated. U-937 cells were treated with S-PAC-1 for various lengths of time. After treatment
with S-PAC-1, cells were washed to remove compound and
cultured in growth medium without compound. Cell death
was assessed at 72 hours for all treatment times. An IC50
value was determined for each exposure time and reported
in Table 1. At times shorter than 6 hours, the IC50 value was
greater than the highest concentration tested. Between 12
and 24 hours, the IC50 value rapidly decreased to a minimum
and showed little variation over the course of the subsequent
48 hours. These time dependency experiments suggest that
S-PAC-1 will be most effective in vivo if cancer cells are exposed to the compound for at least 24 hours.

S-PAC-1 induces death in multiple cancer cell lines
in culture
Having confirmed that S-PAC-1 chelates zinc and activates
procaspase-3 in vitro, the antineoplastic activity of S-PAC-1
was assessed against a panel of human, canine, and murine
cancer cell lines using the sulforhodamine B assay (21). The
72-hour IC50 values for PAC-1 and S-PAC-1 are reported
in Table 1. Both PAC-1 and S-PAC-1 have micromolar cytotoxic IC50 values against all lymphoma cell lines tested regardless of the species of origin. U-937 cells treated with
DMSO, 50 μmol/L PAC-1, or 50 μmol/L S-PAC-1 for 12 hours
were assessed by Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining

S-PAC-1 has no detectable neurotoxic effect in mice
Having confirmed the activity of S-PAC-1 in vitro and in
cell culture, the toxicity of S-PAC-1 (when administered in
HPβCD via tail vein injection) was assessed in C57/BL6 mice
and is summarized in Supplementary Table S1. S-PAC-1 exhibited no observable toxicity at any dose tested. Given the
dramatically reduced neurotoxic effect of S-PAC-1, pharmacokinetic analysis was performed to compare the plasma
concentrations achievable with PAC-1 and S-PAC-1. Mice
were treated with 20 mg/kg PAC-1 (the dose at which significant neurologic symptoms first appear), 50 mg/kg PAC-1
(the dose where acute neurologic symptoms are present),

concentrations were determined by HPLC. Administration of 125 mg/kg S-PAC-1 provides a peak plasma concentration of ∼170 μmol/L and a half-life of ∼1 h.

the next 24 h. Blood was drawn at the times indicated, and the S-PAC-1 serum concentration was determined by HPLC. Continuous infusion of S-PAC-1
was well tolerated and successful in establishing a steady-state serum concentration of S-PAC-1 in dogs.

and 350 mg/kg S-PAC-1 (the highest dose tested) via tail vein
injection. Serum was analyzed by high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) to provide the pharmacokinetic
profiles for S-PAC-1 and PAC-1 (Fig. 2A). At the PAC-1 dosage
that induced mild neurotoxicity (20 mg/kg), peak plasma
concentrations were ∼50 μmol/L. In contrast, a 350 mg/kg
dose of S-PAC-1 provided peak plasma levels of ∼3,500
μmol/L without any signs of neurotoxicity.
S-PAC-1 has a short half-life in mice
S-PAC-1 (125 mg/kg) was administered to mice via i.p.
injection and found to have a short half-life (∼1 hour,
Fig. 2B); it was predicted that the mice would need to be
treated with a 350 mg/kg dose of S-PAC-1 every 2 hours to
achieve and maintain a minimum plasma concentration of
10 μmol/L over a course of 24 hours. Although this frequent
dosing regimen for S-PAC-1 (i.p. every 2 hours for 24 hours)
was technically feasible, further evaluation of S-PAC-1 as a
novel therapeutic agent using murine tumor models was

7236

Cancer Res; 70(18) September 15, 2010

not methodologically practical. As such, we sought to further
investigate S-PAC-1 in a larger mammalian experimental system, specifically healthy and spontaneous cancer-bearing
dogs, which conferred greater practicality for the maintenance
of S-PAC-1 steady-state concentrations for prolonged periods of time.
Assessment of S-PAC-1 in research dogs
Healthy research hound dogs were used for pharmacokinetic and toxicity investigations of S-PAC-1. First, four research hound dogs were treated with 25 mg/kg S-PAC-1
(solubilized in HPβCD) via i.v. injection over 10 minutes.
In addition to pharmacokinetic analysis, the hematologic
and nonhematologic tolerability of single-dose, i.v. S-PAC-1
administration was monitored in research dogs weekly for 4
consecutive weeks (Supplementary Table S2A). As shown in
Fig. 2C, the peak plasma concentration resulting from this
25 mg/kg i.v. bolus dose was ∼150 μmol/L. From analysis of
the pharmacokinetic profile, the half-life of S-PAC-1 in dogs

was calculated to be 1.09 ± 0.02 hours (Table 2). Additionally, single-dose, i.v. S-PAC-1 treatment was well tolerated
by all four research dogs, and no short- or long-term
adverse events were observed with these animals as a result
of treatment.
Based on the half-life of 1.09 ± 0.02 hours in dogs, continuousrate infusion was explored in an attempt to maintain a steadystate serum concentration of S-PAC-1 during the course of the
treatment. Three healthy research dogs were used to determine if S-PAC-1 could be safely administered via a continuous-rate infusion regimen, and to determine appropriate
dosing levels to maintain plasma concentrations above ∼10
μmol/L. Each dog received a different dose of S-PAC-1
(Fig. 2D) with an initial loading dose via i.v. infusion over
the course of 10 minutes followed by a maintenance dose delivered by an infusion pump for an additional 24 hours. Each
dog was observed throughout the course of the 24-hour infusions for adverse reactions, and blood was drawn at intervals
to assess the pharmacokinetic profile of S-PAC-1 treatment. In
addition, following completion of S-PAC-1 infusion, research
dogs were evaluated for hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity weekly for 4 consecutive weeks. During this period, no
dogs exhibited hematologic parameters outside of reference

ranges (Supplementary Table S2B), and no adverse events
were reported by animal care staff.
S-PAC-1 administered as a 24-hour continuous-rate infusion can be safely given to research dogs and easily reaches
micromolar steady-state plasma concentrations that correlate with dose escalation (Fig. 2D). Based on these results,
it was predicted that a 7 mg/kg loading dose and 3 mg/kg/h
constant-rate infusion would be sufficient to achieve a
steady-state plasma concentration of ∼10 μmol/L.
Assessment of S-PAC-1 in dogs with lymphoma
Having confirmed the in vitro activity of S-PAC-1 and having shown that the compound can be safely administered via
continuous-rate infusion and that steady-state plasma concentrations of S-PAC-1 of >10 μmol/L may be achieved for
a 24-hour duration, a small (n = 6) clinical trial of clientowned pet dogs with spontaneous lymphoma was conducted.
The aim of this trial was to show the feasibility of dosing SPAC-1 in dogs with lymphoma and to determine if therapeutic serum levels of compound could be achieved via this
dosing regimen. Pet dogs presented or referred to the
Small Animal Clinic at the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign (UIUC) College of Veterinary Medicine were

considered for enrollment in the clinical trial (see Supplementary Data for inclusion criteria). Dogs that entered the
study received treatment with S-PAC-1 as a single entity drug
for 4 weeks and were followed for an additional 2 weeks after
drug withdrawal.
Toxicity and pharmacokinetics of S-PAC-1 in canine
lymphoma patients
Six patient dogs received treatment with S-PAC-1 via one
of two treatment regimens (summarized in Table 3). Patients
enrolled in the first treatment regimen (n = 3) received a
once-a-week 24-hour continuous infusion of S-PAC-1 for four
weekly cycles. Patients enrolled in the second treatment
regimen (n = 3) received a 72-hour continuous infusion
of S-PAC-1 every other week for two treatment cycles.
Blood was collected during each S-PAC-1 treatment cycle
for pharmacokinetic analysis. In addition, blood was collected from all pet dogs at each scheduled follow-up visit
to characterize hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity.
Between administrations, patients were monitored by pet
owners for gastrointestinal toxicity observational scores adhering the VCOG-CTCAE (22). All patients enrolled in
either treatment regimen did not show any clinically sig-

nificant hematologic or nonhematologic toxicity (Supplementary Table S2C and D). Only minor adverse events
were reported by pet owners, such as self-limiting and localized irritation at the infusion site (n = 4), transient loss
of appetite (n = 1), and mild diarrhea (n = 3). All adverse
reactions subsided within 48 hours of the end of each
treatment cycle. Serum analysis indicated that all patients
had measurable serum concentrations of S-PAC-1, as
shown in Fig. 3. In accordance with our prediction from
the healthy research dogs, an infusion with a loading dose
of 7 mg/kg and a constant-rate infusion of 3 mg/kg/h was
sufficient to achieve steady-state plasma concentrations of
>10 μmol/L in the majority of treatments.
Antitumor activity of S-PAC-1
Given the small number of patients included in this clinical study, antitumor activity of S-PAC-1 cannot be conclusively determined. However, of the six patients treated, one
patient (patient 1) showed a partial response with a ∼30%
reduction in both caliper RECIST score and the mandibular
lymph node measurements by CT scan over the course of the
4-week treatment (Fig. 4A and B). During treatment, this dog
received a 24-hour continuous i.v. infusion of S-PAC-1 once a

infusion was generally successful in achieving the target plasma concentration (10 μmol/L) for either 24 h (A, dogs 1–3) or 72 h (B, dogs 4–6). Data
labels indicate doses (loading dose, mg/kg; continuous infusion dose, mg/kg/h) administered during the clinical trial. Blood was drawn at various times
throughout drug administration, and serum concentration was determined by HPLC.

ter S-PAC-1 treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1) most likely
represents the induction of apoptosis in malignant lymphocytes; however, a small percentage of this shift may be due to
nonmalignant lymphocytes and stromal cells.

week (total of four treatments). Following the four treatment
cycles, drug administration was withdrawn and the dog was
monitored by RECIST for 2 subsequent weeks. After discontinuation of S-PAC-1 treatment, the RECIST scores for this
dog increased dramatically (days 36 and 42). In addition to
this partial response, three patients showed stable disease
(patients 2–4), whereas two patients showed disease progression (patients 5 and 6), as indicated in Table 3. The rapid
increase in RECIST scores after drug withdrawal shown in
patient 1 is representative of the effect of drug withdrawal
in all patients.
Analysis of lymph node aspirates from two dogs (patients
1 and 2) shows the presence of the procaspase-3 drug target
before treatment as well as an increase in cleaved caspase-3
after treatment with S-PAC-1 (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Lymph node aspirates collected from these dogs with lymphoma consisted of >90% malignant lymphocytes based on
cytologic evaluation. Based on the predominance of malignant lymphocytes, the observed shift in cleaved caspase-3 af-

S-PAC-1 is the first compound in the PAC-1 class (and the
first small-molecule activator of procaspase-3) to be evaluated in a clinical trial of cancer patients. As such, the evaluation of S-PAC-1 in a clinical setting is a proof of concept for
the strategy of direct procaspase-3 activation as an anticancer therapy. Compounds in the PAC-1 class activate procaspase-3 via chelation of inhibitory zinc ions (10). Intracellular
zinc is found principally in tightly bound complexes in metalloproteinases, zinc finger domains, and other metal binding proteins; however, ∼10% of cellular zinc is believed to
exist in a loosely bound, labile pool (23). Several studies implicate labile zinc as an endogenous antiapoptotic regulator
(24–26), and chelation of the loosely bound pool of zinc is an
emerging anticancer strategy (9, 10, 27). Thus, the evaluation
of S-PAC-1 is also a proof of concept for the chelation of the
labile zinc pool as an anticancer therapy.
It is perhaps not surprising that high doses of PAC-1 induce neurotoxicity, given its zinc chelation properties and
predicted BBB permeability. Zinc homeostasis is important
in the CNS (28), and NMDA receptors require bound zinc
to provide a tonic inhibition (17). NMDA receptors bind to
zinc with a low affinity (Kd = 5.5 μmol/L; ref. 29), which suggests that a zinc chelator with a higher affinity for zinc such
as PAC-1 (Kd = 52 nmol/L) would be able to successfully sequester zinc from these receptors. Several studies indicate
that intracellular zinc chelation results in hyperexcitation
of these receptors (16), resulting in symptoms such as uncontrolled muscle movement and seizure (17, 30). One strategy
for reducing the permeability of a compound through the
BBB is to increase the polarity of the molecule (18). Addition
of the sulfonamide functional group is a good candidate for
such polarity increase, as the aryl sulfonamide motif is common in several small-molecule therapeutics. The dramatically different neurotoxic effects of S-PAC-1 and PAC-1 suggest
that S-PAC-1 is considerably less BBB permeable and may be
the more attractive drug candidate.
Spontaneously arising cancers in pet dogs share many similarities with human cancers, including histologic appearance, tumor genetics, molecular targets, biological and
clinical behavior, and response to therapy (31). Of these
spontaneous canine cancers, multicentric lymphoma is the
most common, occurring in 13 to 24 of every 100,000 dogs
(32). The clinical progression and treatment of multicentric
B- or T-cell canine lymphoma has many of the same characteristics of non–Hodgkin lymphoma in humans. Canine lymphoma and human non–Hodgkin lymphoma both respond
clinically to the same cytotoxic drugs such as doxorubicin,
vincristine, and cyclophosphamide. These drugs are components of the CHOP treatment protocol, first-line therapy
for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in humans (33). When
administered to dogs, CHOP will induce complete clinical

remission in ∼90% of dogs diagnosed with lymphoma (34,
35). Similar to the human response, the majority of dogs
who achieve remission with CHOP therapy will experience
disease relapse (36). Given the commonalities between
human and canine lymphoma, evaluation of S-PAC-1 in a
canine lymphoma clinical trial may provide important translational information for the development of S-PAC-1 as a
novel human therapeutic.
Although inconclusive in this study design, it is highly encouraging that four of six patients achieved partial response
or stable disease for 4 weeks in duration, as canine lymphoma is generally a rapidly progressive malignancy with dramatic enlargement of peripheral lymph nodes within weeks
of disease diagnosis. As shown in Table 3, one dog enrolled in
the current study (patient 1) was in remission for 5 months
after CHOP therapy and was recently diagnosed with recurrent lymphoma. On enrollment in the study, this dog showed
a ∼30% reduction in tumor size in response to S-PAC-1 treatment. This partial response is significant given the comparatively short treatment duration (4 weeks for S-PAC-1 versus
19 weeks for CHOP), and that the dose of S-PAC-1 administered does not seem to be near the maximum tolerated dose.
In conclusion, we have discovered S-PAC-1 as a procaspase-activating compound that can be safely administered
in vivo, and have identified pet dogs with lymphoma as a
tractable model for the assessment of small-molecule procaspase-3 activation as an anticancer strategy. The use of this
large animal model allows drug administration via continuous-rate i.v. infusion, something necessary with S-PAC-1 (due
to its short half-life in vivo) and not practical in murine
tumor models. S-PAC-1 induces apoptotic death in cultured

cancer cells, with similar activity to the parent compound
PAC-1. Whereas high doses of PAC-1 (when administered
in HPβCD) induce neurotoxicity in vivo, S-PAC-1 does not
cause this effect at serum concentration ∼70-fold higher. SPAC-1 can be safely administered to mice, research dogs, and
dogs with lymphoma and shows encouraging clinical effect
in this preliminary evaluation. Given the absence of neurotoxicity with S-PAC-1 and the large safety window observed
in mice, it is anticipated that S-PAC-1 will prove to be safe at
escalated doses, and thus, its further evaluation in cancer patients is warranted.
