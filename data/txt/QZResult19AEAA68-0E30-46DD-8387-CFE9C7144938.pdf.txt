BACKGROUND: Although controversial, evidence suggests statins may reduce the risk of advanced prostate cancer
(PC), and recently statin use was associated with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) reductions among men without PC.
The authors sought to examine the association between statin use and PSA recurrence after radical prostatectomy
(RP). METHODS: The authors examined 1319 men treated with RP from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer
Hospital (SEARCH) Database. Time to PSA recurrence was compared between users and nonusers of statin at surgery using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for multiple clinical and pathological features. RESULTS: In
total, 236 (18%) men were taking statins at RP. Median follow-up was 24 months for statin users and 38 for nonusers.
Statin users were older (P < .001) and underwent RP more recently (P < .001). Statin users were diagnosed at lower
clinical stages (P ¼ .009) and with lower PSA levels (P ¼ .04). However, statin users tended to have higher biopsy
Gleason scores (P ¼ .002). After adjusting for multiple clinical and pathological factors, statin use was associated
with a 30% lower risk of PSA recurrence (hazard ratio ‘‘HR’’, 0.70; 95% confidence interval ‘‘CI’’, 0.50-0.97; P ¼ .03),
which was dose dependent (relative to no statin use; dose equivalent<simvastatin 20 mg: HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.66-1.73;
P ¼ .78; dose equivalent ¼ simvastatin 20 mg: HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.32-1.00; P ¼ .05; dose equivalent>simvastatin 20
mg: HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.27-0.93; P ¼ .03). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of men undergoing RP, statin use was associated with a dose-dependent reduction in the risk of biochemical recurrence. If confirmed in other studies, these findC 2010 American Cancer Society.

The efficacy of statin medications in improving cholesterol profiles and reducing cardiovascular mortality is well
described and backed by high-quality, level I evidence.1 Statins also have excellent safety profiles and are well tolerated,2
and because of this risk-benefit ratio are the most commonly prescribed drug class in the United States.3
Recently, attention has focused on whether statins influence cancer incidence and outcomes. Laboratory studies
show statins have antineoplastic properties that are both cholesterol-mediated4,5 and non-cholesterol-mediated.6
Epidemiologic studies examining whether statins lower risk of overall prostate cancer (PC) have been conflicting.1,7-9
However, several large prospective cohort studies found statins may be associated with reduced risk of advanced PC,

although the numbers of men with advanced disease are
small.10-14 Recently, we found that in men without PC,
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels declined after starting
statins, and this decline was independently proportional to
the statin dose and the amount by which cholesterol levels
lowered.15 This may represent an objective marker of statins’ influence on prostate biology, but the PSA lowering
could theoretically complicate cancer diagnosis.
Because of the complexity of these potential PSA
changes and the different risks for overall versus advanced
PC, it is more feasible to examine the influence of statins
in subsets of men, including those already diagnosed and
undergoing treatment.
Some studies suggest that statins may reduce biochemical progression in men undergoing external beam
radiotherapy,16,17 although not all studies agree.18 One
prior study examined statin use among men undergoing
radical prostatectomy (RP) and found no change in the
risk of biochemical recurrence; however, statin dose, duration of therapy, and other important potential confounding variables were not controlled for.19 Thus, we sought
to study the association between statin use and outcomes
in men undergoing RP within the Shared Equal Access
Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database.20

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
After obtaining institutional review board approval from
each institution, data from patients undergoing RP between
1988 and 2008 at 5 Veterans Administration (VA) Medical
Centers across the country were combined into
SEARCH.20 SEARCH does not include patients treated
with preoperative androgen deprivation or radiation therapy. Within SEARCH, 2320 patients were available for
analysis. However, statin data were unavailable from 1 center and thus, patients from that center were excluded (n ¼
345). We also excluded 53 (2%) patients in whom PC was
diagnosed after transurethral resection of the prostate, 214
(9%) with unknown clinical stage, 39 (2%) with unknown
biopsy Gleason scores, 2 (<1%) with unknown race, 46
(2%) with unknown preoperative PSA, and 38 (1%) with
missing follow-up data. Finally, we excluded 264 (11%)
men treated before 1996, as very few men (6 of 264) before
1996 were on statins, resulting in a population of 1319.
Follow-Up
As this was a retrospective analysis, follow-up protocols
were not predetermined and were left to the discretion of
the treating physicians at each of the 4 centers. Biochemi-

3390

cal recurrence was defined as a single PSA >0.2 ng/mL, 2
concentrations at 0.2 ng/mL, or secondary treatment for
detectable postoperative PSA. Men receiving adjuvant
therapy 6 months after surgery for an undetectable PSA
were considered as nonrecurrent at the time of adjuvant
therapy, and their follow-up was censored at that point.
Statistical Analysis
Type and dose of statin and duration of use before and after
surgery were ascertained by examining the pharmacy database within the VA computerized medical records. Statin
use of 1 day before surgery was considered sufficient to be
classified as a statin user. Doses were translated into dose
equivalents (DEs) based on published guidelines, with simvastatin 20 mg being assigned a value of 1.21 Because few
patients were on very high (4) or very low (<0.5) DEs,
DEs were analyzed categorically as <1, 1, and >1. Differences in demographic and clinicopathological factors
between statin users and nonusers were examined using t
tests and chi-square tests for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. For non-normally distributed continuous variables, rank sum tests were used. Differences in
recurrence risk between statin users and nonusers were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards analyses.22 The relationship between statin use and biochemical recurrence was
tested to ensure that the assumptions of the proportional
hazards model were not violated. With 236 statin users and
1083 nonusers accrued over a 12-year period (1996-2008)
with a maximum follow-up of 12 years, using a 2-sided logrank test of the difference in biochemical recurrence-free
survival with a P value of .05, our power is 0.82 to detect a
hazard ratio (HR) of 0.70 in favor of statin users.
Analyses predicting recurrence risk were adjusted for
either clinical factors (age at surgery, year of surgery, race,
body mass index [BMI], biopsy Gleason score, preoperative
PSA, center, clinical stage, percentage of biopsy cores containing cancer) or clinical and pathological factors (pathological Gleason score, extracapsular extension, seminal
vesicle invasion, positive margins, positive lymph nodes).
Center (1-4), BMI (<25, 25.0-29.9, 30-34.9, 35 kg/
m2), race (white, black, nonwhite-nonblack), clinical stage
(T1c, T2/T3), and Gleason score (6, 7, 8) were analyzed as categorical variables, whereas age, year of surgery,
percent of biopsy cores containing cancer, and the natural
log of PSA were analyzed as continuous variables.
The association between statin use and time to PSA
recurrence adjusted for the multiple clinical and pathological features was illustrated graphically by computing the
Kaplan-Meier survival curve23 for the referent group

(statin nonusers). For statin users, the curve was estimated
by multiplying the survival function of the referent group
(statin nonusers) by the HR for statin use obtained from
the multivariate Cox model (Multivariate 2). The influence of statin dose on this relationship was modeled by
creating a 4-tier categorical variable (no statin use, <1
DE, 1 DE, >1 DE).
As some studies suggest that statins may preferentially affect aggressive prostate cancer,10-14 we determined
if the association between statin use and recurrence differed depending on pre- and postoperative risk assessment.
We stratified patients first into preoperative risk categories
according to D’Amico et al24 (low risk ‘‘PSA 10, clinical
stage T1c/T2a, and Gleason score 6’’, intermediate risk
‘‘PSA >10 but 20, clinical stage T2b, or Gleason score
7’’, high risk ‘‘PSA >20, clinical stage T2c, or Gleason
score 8’’) and postoperatively by whether the disease was
organ confined (organ confined ‘‘T2, margin negative,
lymph node negative’’ vs non-organ confined ‘‘T2 with
positive margins, T3a/T3b or lymph node positive’’). Similar stratified analyses were done for age (median 61 vs
>61 years), race (white, black, nonwhite-nonblack), and
BMI (<25, 25.0-29.9, 30-34.9, and 35 kg/m2).
All statistical analyses were performed using Stata
9.2 (StataCorp, College Station, Tex).

RESULTS
Clinical and Pathological Characteristics
A total of 236 (18%) men were taking statins at the time
of surgery. On average, statin users were 2.0 years older
(P < .001), yet had significantly lower median PSA levels
(P ¼ .04). Statin users had a higher probability of being
white (P < .001) and higher BMI (P ¼ .005), presented
with lower clinical stage (P ¼ .009), yet higher biopsy
Gleason scores (P ¼ .002), and were operated on more
recently (P < .001) (Table 1).
At surgery, statin users were more likely to have highgrade disease in the pathological specimen (P ¼ .001).
However, there were no significant differences in the rates
of extracapsular extension, positive margins, seminal vesicle
invasion, or lymph node metastases (Table 1). After adjusting for multiple clinical characteristics, the increased risk of
high-grade pathological disease was no longer statistically
significant (P ¼ .20), and there remained no significant differences in odds of extracapsular extension, positive margins, or seminal vesicle invasion. Overall, 260 (20%) men
received radiation therapy after surgery, 158 (12%)
received hormonal therapy, and 84 (6%) received both. Af-

function of the referent group (statin nonusers) by the hazard ratio obtained from the multivariate Cox model.

ter stratifying by statin use, there was no difference in the

Biochemical Disease Recurrence
Biochemical recurrences occurred among 304 (23%)
men: 37 (16%) statin users and 267 (25%) nonusers.
Overall, statin use was not associated with biochemical recurrence (HR, 0.90; 95% confidence interval ‘‘CI’’, 0.681.19; log-rank P ¼ .45) (Table 2). However, after adjusting for multiple clinical (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51-0.98;
P ¼ .04) or clinical and pathological features (HR, 0.70;
95% CI, 0.50-0.97; P ¼ .03), statin users had significantly
lower biochemical recurrence risk (Fig. 1) (Tables 2
and 3).

PSA was logarithmically transformed.

To determine which factor had the greatest impact
on strengthening the inverse association between statin
use and recurrence risk, we added each covariate to the
multivariate model (Multivariate 2) 1 at a time. Adding
Gleason score (either biopsy or pathological) generated
the largest shift in HR for statin use. However, when
stratified by pathological Gleason score (6, 7, 8), statin use on multivariate analysis still trended toward an
inverse association with biochemical recurrence across all
strata of Gleason scores (data not shown).
A post hoc analysis of the influence of statin dose on
biochemical recurrence risk found only doses 1 DE
were associated with lower risk, whereas a DE <1 was not
associated with recurrence (Table 4). Thus, we repeated
the full multivariate model categorizing statin use as nonuse/<1 DE versus 1 DE. In doing so, 1 DE of statin
use was associated with a 46% reduced risk of biochemical
recurrence (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.35-0.83; P ¼ .005). We

also found that duration of statin use before surgery was
not associated with recurrence (data not shown). As 89%
of men had documented statin use at least up to within
3 months of their last PSA follow-up, we could not assess
the association between postsurgical statin duration and
biochemical recurrence.

As depicted in Table 2.

We previously found that statin use in men without
PC was associated with a 4.1% decline in PSA.15 Thus,
for a PSA of 0.2 ng/mL, the cutoff used to define recurrence, a 4.1% decline would translate into an adjusted
PSA of 0.192 ng/mL. Given a median PSA doubling time
among recurrent patients of 15.1 months within
SEARCH,20 this would translate into an approximate 27
day delay in diagnosing recurrence among statin users. After subtracting 27 days from the time to recurrence among
all recurrent statin users and repeating the multivariate
analysis adjusting for clinical and pathological factors, the
results are essentially unchanged (data not shown).
The protective association observed for statin users
overall held across strata of D’Amico preoperative risk categories (P-interaction ¼ .47), whether the cancer was
organ-confined at surgery (P-interaction ¼ .53), and
across race (P-interaction ¼ .50) and age strata (Pinteraction ¼ .65). However, statin users in each of the 3
lowest BMI categories (n ¼ 37: <25 kg/m2; n ¼ 101:
25.0-29.9 kg/m2; n ¼ 59: 30-34.9 kg/m2) had a reduced
recurrence risk, whereas statin users in the highest BMI
category (n ¼ 22: 35.0 kg/m2) had increased recurrence
risk. When stratified into <35.0 versus 35.0 kg/m2, statin use in the highest BMI category (35.0 kg/m2) was
associated with increased recurrence risk (HR, 17.3; 95%
CI, 3.39-88.1; P ¼ .001) relative to nonusers, whereas statin use among men with BMI <35.0 kg/m2 (HR, 0.60;
95% CI, 0.41-0.86; P ¼ .006) was associated with
decreased risk (P-interaction ¼ .001). Similar results were
obtained when statin use was categorized as 1 DE versus
<1 DE/no use. Specifically, statin use 1 DE was associated with a 59% reduced risk of biochemical recurrence
(HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.25-0.67; P < .001) among men
with a BMI <35.0 kg/m2, but an increased risk of recurrence among men with a BMI 35.0 kg/m2 (HR, 15.7;
95% CI, 3.25-75.4; P ¼ .001) (P-interaction ¼ .001).
Statin users had shorter follow-up. In addition to
using time-to-event analyses and controlling for year of

3394

surgery in all analyses, we further explored if the protective
association observed for statin users was a result of followup bias by dividing our patients into groups based up 4year blocks (1996-1999, 2000-2003, and 2004-2008; Table 5). There were roughly equal numbers of men in each
group, and follow-up was similar for statin users and nonusers except in the most recent group, wherein statin users
had a 5 months shorter median follow-up. When stratified by year of treatment, statin use was associated with
lower recurrence risk within each year stratum, although
this did not always reach statistical significance because of
smaller numbers, and men on higher doses of statins had
reduced recurrence risk across all year strata.

DISCUSSION
Mounting evidence suggests that statins may influence
prostate biology, and although controversial, statins may
reduce the risk of advanced PC.10-14 However, studying
statins as primary prevention for PC poses logistical and
financial challenges.25 We sought to examine the influence of statins in men with PC undergoing RP. In our
cohort, statin users differed significantly from nonusers at
presentation. Statin users had lower PSA and clinical
stages, but were older, and had higher BMI and higher biopsy Gleason scores. After adjusting for these and other
clinical and pathological variables, statin users were 30%
less likely to recur after surgery (P ¼ .03), while men taking 1 DE, were 46% less likely to recur (P ¼ .005). If
confirmed in other studies, a randomized controlled trial
(RCT) of statins among men undergoing prostatectomy
may be warranted.
Recent evidence has pointed to statins potentially preventing cancer. Laboratory evidence shows that statins inhibit inflammation,26 angiogenesis,27 cell proliferation,28
migration/adhesion,29 and invasion,30 and promote apoptosis selective for tumor cells.31 Studies with PC cells have
also been encouraging, suggesting that statins may inhibit

PC growth and development.32 The mechanisms through
which statins inhibit cancer processes can be classified into
cholesterol-mediated and non-cholesterol-mediated. By
altering serum cholesterol levels, statins alter the cholesterol
composition of cell membrane domains that are involved
in intracellular signaling.5 Some of these signaling pathways
have been implicated in PC development and growth.4,33
Statins may influence prostate biology through non-cholesterol-mediated, or direct, pathways too. For example, statins induce apoptosis through inhibition of cell cycle
enzymes34 and have antiangiogenic and anti-inflammatory
properties that may inhibit PC development and subsequent progression.6
Initial observational studies suggested that statins
reduced PC risk.7,35 However, subsequent studies, including meta-analyses of RCTs of statins and cardiovascular
outcomes, found no association between statin use and
overall PC.1,9,36-44 Recently, 5 large prospective cohort
studies confirmed that statins were not associated with
overall PC risk, but observed that statins were associated
with reduced risk of advanced disease, although the number of cases of advanced cancer were small.10-14 In these
studies, the risk of advanced disease declined with longer
duration and/or higher dose.
A few studies examined whether statins augment PC
therapies. A study of 938 patients undergoing brachytherapy found that statin users (n ¼ 191) had significantly
lower PSA levels, a lower percentage of positive biopsy
cores, and smaller prostates. Although they tended to have
improved PC-specific and overall survival, this was not
statistically significant in multivariate analysis.45 A study
of 871 men undergoing external beam radiation therapy
(EBRT) found improved 10-year PSA-free survival for
statin users (76% vs 66%; P ¼ .01), which held after multivariate adjustment (P ¼ .03).16 Another study of 719
men undergoing EBRT found similar benefit for statin
users after multivariate adjustment.17 However, a third
study of 968 men undergoing EBRT found that statin
use, in multivariate analysis, was not significantly predictive of PSA-free survival.18
A recent retrospective cohort study of 1351 men
undergoing RP found statin users had lower preoperative
PSA levels, tumor volumes, and percentage of prostate
involved with cancer.46 Furthermore, statin users had
lower rates of adverse pathological features in the RP specimen. However, biochemical recurrence was not evaluated
as an outcome in this study.
In our study, despite being older with higher BMI
and Gleason scores, 3 adverse risk factors for recurrence,

on crude analysis statin users trended toward reduced recurrence risk (HR, 0.90; P ¼ .45). After adjusting for the
differing clinical and pathological factors, statin users
had a significant 30% lower recurrence risk (P ¼ .03).
Of note, another series by Mondul et al also found a
generally similar association between statin use and
decreased recurrence risk after prostatectomy (unpublished data).
We also observed that statin use at doses <1 DE
were not associated with recurrence risk, whereas 1 and
>1 DE appeared to equally reduce recurrence risk. This
apparent dose threshold at simvastatin 20 mg (ie, 1 DE)
is identical to the dose relationship we previously
observed in our study of statin use and PSA levels.15
Although also a VA-based study, that study cohort was
comprised of markedly different men: healthy men without PC. Thus, as we have now seen similar findings across
2 populations, this may reflect a statin dose threshold to
influence prostate biology, although more study is
needed.
Time to recurrence after surgery correlates with risk
of PC progression and death.47 With 35% of men experiencing biochemical recurrence within 10 years after RP,
there is a clear potential for statins.48 Given that statins
appear to lower PSA values,15 1 potential explanation is
statins merely delay the diagnosis of recurrence. However,
on average, statin use lowers PSA by only 4%,15 thus in
men with PSA values around 0.2 ng/mL, a cutoff for
determining biochemical recurrence, it is unlikely that statin use would meaningfully alter observed time to recurrence. Further studies examining the PSA doubling time,
time to metastases, or time to death among statin users
with recurrent PC are needed.
Although we did not identify any modification of
the statin effect across different categories of pre- or postoperative risk, age, or race, we did notice differences across
BMI categories. Specifically, for those in the highest BMI
category (35 kg/m2), statins were associated with an
increased recurrence risk. This finding may be spurious,
as only 22 men in this BMI category used statins. However, a case-control study examining statin use and risk of
PC diagnosis found statins protective for lower BMI categories, but for obese men (BMI 30 kg/m2) statin use
was associated with increased risk (odds ratio, 1.8; 95%
CI, 1.1-3.0).49 Another prospective cohort study, however, found no interaction between statin use and BMI in
the setting of risk of PC diagnosis.10 Thus, the relationship between statins and PC among obese men warrants
further investigation.

Statin users differed significantly from nonusers.
Although we controlled for multiple clinical and pathological variables, it is possible that residual confounding
could explain the reduced recurrence risk. Specifically,
statin users may have had differences in diet, exercise,
smoking, and screening behaviors. Unfortunately we were
not able to capture these data. Poor diet, lack of exercise,
and smoking have all been linked to adverse prostate cancer outcomes. As statin use is indicated for hyperlipidemia
and myocardial infarctions, conditions linked with the
above lifestyle factors, it is possible that these poor risk
lifestyle factors were more prevalent among statin users.
Thus, one would expect statin users to be more likely to
recur after surgery. Yet we observed the opposite. Pertaining to screening behavior, the prevailing assumption is
that men on statins represent a group more likely to seek
preventive care and thus more likely to be screened for
both hyperlipidemia and PC.10 This theoretically would
translate into earlier diagnoses at earlier disease stages.
Indeed, statin users were diagnosed at lower clinical stages.
However, if we apply the same assumed bias postoperatively, statin users would have greater postoperative surveillance, potentially again biasing against statin users, as
the closer patients are followed after surgery, the sooner a
recurrence would be detected. Thus, taken together,
although we unfortunately cannot capture information on
diet, exercise, smoking, and screening behavior, we estimate that if available and adjusted for, these data would
only have further strengthened the inverse association
between statins and recurrence. In addition, we did not
assess if nonusers of statin at surgery subsequently started
statins. As such, our control group may be contaminated
with statin users, causing a further underestimation of the
effect of statins.
Our study did not have sufficient power to examine
PC-specific or overall mortality, as too few men met these
endpoints. In our cohort, the median follow-up of 3 years
was relatively short. However, prior data with 6-year
mean follow-up found that nearly 2=3 of recurrences occur
within 3 years after surgery, and those recurring after 3
years are less likely to be fatal and thus of unclear clinical
significance.47 Thus, we believe we have captured the majority of recurrences. As statin use only became prevalent
in the early 2000s, it is expected that nonusers would have
longer follow-up and more recurrences overall. However,
in addition to using time-to-event analyses and adjusting
for year in all of our analyses, when we stratified our
results by year of surgery, we observed that the protective
association held across all strata of year of surgery.

Conclusions
In this group of men undergoing RP, statin use was significantly associated with a reduced biochemical recurrence
risk, which was dose dependent. Our findings require
confirmation in other settings and in particular to determine whether statins are associated with a reduction in
metastases and/or PC-specific and overall mortality. Further retrospective studies may help elucidate the optimal
timing to start a statin, but if the association between statin use and reduced recurrence risk holds regardless of the
timing of statin use before surgery, an RCT placing men
undergoing RP on statins may be warranted. Given that
statins have proven efficacy in preventing cardiovascular
mortality, if it is definitively proven that statins reduce recurrence after surgery, then the potential influence statins
could have on overall and disease-specific mortality is
substantial.
