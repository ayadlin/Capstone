BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are commonly used
antihypertensive medications that have been reported to affect aberrant angiogenesis and the dysregulated inflammatory response.
Because of such mechanisms, it was hypothesized that these medications might affect the tumor response to neoadjuvant radiation
in patients with rectal cancer. METHODS: One hundred fifteen patients who were treated with neoadjuvant radiation at the University
of Wisconsin (UW) between 1999 and 2012 were identified. Univariate analyses were performed with anonymized patient data. In a
second independent data set, 186 patients with rectal cancer who were treated with neoadjuvant radiation at the Queen’s Medical
Center of the University of Hawaii (UH) between 1995 and 2010 were identified. These data were independently analyzed as before.
Multivariate analyses were performed with aggregate data. RESULTS: Among patients taking ACEIs/ARBs in the UW data set, a significant 3-fold increase in the rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant therapy (52% vs 17%, P 5 .001) was
observed. This finding was confirmed in the UH data set, in which a significant 2-fold–increased pCR rate (24% vs 12%, P 5 .03) was
observed. Identified patient and treatment characteristics were otherwise balanced between patients taking and not taking ACEIs/
ARBs. No significant effect was observed on pCR rates with other medications, including statins, metformin, and aspirin. Multivariate
analyses of aggregate data identified ACEI/ARB use as a strong predictor of pCR (odds ratio, 4.02; 95% confidence interval, 2.067.82; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The incidental use of ACEIs/ARBs among patients with rectal cancer is associated with a significantly

INTRODUCTION
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are common medications
that treat hypertension through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Renin is an enzyme that cleaves angiotensinogen peptide to produce the decapeptide angiotensin I, which in turn is cleaved by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
to produce the octapeptide angiotensin II.1 Angiotensin II acts on angiotensin receptors to exert vasoconstriction and fluid
retention. Multiple additional angiotensin peptides and ACE substrates have been identified, and this suggests the potential for additional and diverse physiologic functions.2 In particular, ACE is specifically expressed at high levels in monocytes during the process of differentiation and maturation into macrophages or dendritic cells.3,4 In the setting of ischemic
heart disease, ACEIs/ARBs confer a survival benefit, and this may be mediated through effects on angiogenic remodeling5
and through the modification of proinflammatory cytokine dysregulation and macrophage-mediated responses to
lipoproteins.6
In the context of malignancy, preclinical pharmacologic and genetic studies suggest that ACEIs/ARBs may also affect
tumorigenesis through effects on angiogenesis and immunosurveillance by macrophage and T-cell lineages.7 Select retrospective clinical studies support this possibility,8,9 whereas other studies have shown no association between ACEI/ARB
use and the incidence of cancers.10-12 In the setting of an established tumor, retrospective clinical studies suggest that

cancer-specific survival may be improved in the setting of
pancreatic13 and non–small cell lung cancer14 among
those patients taking ACEIs/ARBs. It remains unclear
whether this results from a direct effect of ACEIs/ARBs or
whether these agents modulate tumor responses to other
therapeutics. Additional studies have demonstrated an
impact of ACEIs/ARBs on the normal tissue response to
radiation therapy and resulting reduced rates of cardiopulmonary, renal, and brain toxicity after local or total body
radiation or chemoradiation.15-21
Multiple preclinical studies suggest that agents targeting angiogenesis and/or tumor immune surveillance
have the capacity to modulate tumor responses to radiation.22,23 However, it has not yet been determined
whether ACEIs/ARBs, by affecting angiogenesis or
immune tolerance, can affect tumor responses to radiation. Rectal cancer is commonly treated with neoadjuvant
radiation therapy and, therefore, enables a direct pathologic assessment of responses to neoadjuvant therapy at
the time of surgical resection. We hypothesized that
ACEIs/ARBs might be able to modulate tumor responses
to neoadjuvant chemoradiation among patients with
locally advanced rectal cancer. To test this hypothesis,
using 2 independent single-institution databases, we conducted a retrospective clinical review to evaluate the correlation of incidental ACEI/ARB use with pathologic
response rates among rectal cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant radiation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Collection

With institutional review board approval, we identified
the medical records of 261 patients with rectal cancer
treated at University of Wisconsin (UW) Hospital and
Clinics between January 1, 1999 and July 1, 2012. Of
these 261 patients, 115 underwent neoadjuvant radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy followed by curative-intent
surgery. The data collected for these 115 patients included
the following: age, sex, date of diagnosis, prior diagnosis
of inflammatory bowel disease or diabetes, use of specific
medications at the time of the radiation consultation
(ACEIs/ARBs, metformin, aspirin, or statins), clinical
and pathological staging (American Joint Committee on
Cancer, 7th edition), tumor grade at biopsy and surgery,
pretreatment hemoglobin and carcinoembryonic antigen
(CEA) levels, neoadjuvant radiation and chemotherapy
treatment regimen, completion of neoadjuvant treatment,
time from radiation to surgery, tumor size in the pathology specimen, surgical margin, number of lymph nodes
2488

sampled, number of lymph nodes positive for malignancy,
lymphovascular space invasion, adjuvant chemotherapy
regimen and number of cycles, acute and chronic toxicities (graded according to Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events, version 2.0), pathologic complete
response (pCR), local recurrence (LR), distant recurrence,
overall survival (OS), vital status, and date of last followup. Patients with a pCR were defined as having no evidence of a primary tumor on a posttherapy pathological
examination (ypT0).
After the analysis of the UW data set, institutional
review board approval was obtained to generate a second
database from the medical records of 186 patients with
rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant radiotherapy or
chemoradiotherapy followed by curative-intent surgery at
the Queen’s Medical Center of the University of Hawaii
(UH) between 1995 and 2010. Data collected for this
database included all the factors in the UW data set except
for the adjuvant chemotherapy regimen and acute and
late toxicities. The UH data set did incorporate additional
data on patient ethnicity, biopsy histology, and the type
of surgical procedure.
Statistical Analysis

The UW rectal cancer database was generated to test the
hypothesis that ACEIs/ARBs might affect responses to
neoadjuvant radiation in rectal cancer patients. Because of
the modest size of the database, a decision was made to
generate a second database from a distinct patient population to confirm the statistical significance of the association between the use of ACEI/ARB medications and the
response to radiation among patients with rectal cancer.
The UH database was then generated by investigators
from UH.
Statistical analyses of anonymized patient data were
conducted with JMP Pro 10 and SAS software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The chi-square test was used for a univariate evaluation of nominal variables versus binary
outcomes (ACEI/ARB use or pCR), and a Student t test
was used for a univariate analysis of continuous variables
for the same. A 2-tailed Fisher’s exact test was used for
evaluating associations with acute and late toxicity. Missing data were excluded from analysis. In the UW data set,
complete demographic, medication, treatment, survival,
recurrence, and toxicity data were available for all patients.
Two patients had missing data for clinical staging and
pCR, and 4 patients were missing a component of pathology staging. Fifteen patients were missing the biopsy
grade. Pretreatment CEA and hemoglobin levels were not
available for 47 and 34 patients, respectively. In the UH

data set, complete demographic, ACEI/ARB use, pCR,

missing data for the biopsy grade, 34 were missing data
for the pathologic stage, 2 were missing data for recurrence, 17 were missing data for chemotherapy, 70 were
missing data for pretreatment CEA levels, and 81 were
missing data for pretreatment hemoglobin levels. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate correlates of
pCR, and Cox proportional hazard models were used to
evaluate correlates of time to LR and OS. OS, LR-free survival, and metastasis-free survival curves were estimated
with the Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test was
used to compare survival in 2 or more groups. For all analyses, a 2-sided P value < .05 was considered to be statistically significant.
RESULTS
Enhanced Response to Neoadjuvant Radiation
in Rectal Cancer Patients Taking ACEIs/ARBs

Between 1999 and 2012, 115 patients with rectal cancer
were treated with neoadjuvant radiation therapy at UW.
The median duration of follow-up was 4.1 years. Patient
demographics and tumor characteristics are listed in Table
1. Twenty-five of the 115 patients (21.7%) were taking an
ACEI/ARB at the time of their radiation oncology consultation. No significant difference was observed in this UW
database between the cohort of patients taking an ACEI/
ARB and those not taking these medications with respect
to age (P 5 .16), sex (P 5 .23), pretreatment hemoglobin
(P 5 .95), pretreatment CEA (P 5 .60), clinical stage
(P 5 .94), or biopsy grade (P 5 .42; Table 1).

In the UW database, patients taking ACEIs/ARBs
experienced a significantly increased rate of pCR to neoadjuvant therapy in comparison with patients not taking
an ACEI/ARB (52% vs 17%, P 5 .001; Fig. 1A).
Although the analysis of variance was significant for the
association of pCR with the collective ACEI/ARB medications versus no ACEI/ARB therapy (P 5 .0065), we did
not detect a significant difference when we compared
pCR rates between patients taking different ACEIs/ARBs.
Rates of pCR by medication were as follows: benazepril (2
of 3), candesartan (1 of 1), lisinopril (8 of 17), losartan (1
of 2), monopril (1 of 1), olmesartan (0 of 1), and no
ACE/ARB (15 of 90). All ACEIs in this cohort were of
the dicarboxylate group except for monopril (phosphonate group). In contrast to ACEIs/ARBs, no significant
difference was observed in the rate of pCR to neoadjuvant
radiation among patients in this UW database who were
taking statins (n 5 19; pCR rate, 42% vs 21%; P 5 .13),
glitazones (n 5 4; pCR rate, 75% vs 22%; P 5 .056), aspirin (n 5 24; pCR rate, 33% vs 22%; P 5 .42), or metformin (n 5 4; pCR rate, 50% vs 23%; P 5 .47) versus
those not taking these respective medications (Supporting
Fig. 1 [see online supporting information]).
Treatment patterns and outcomes from the UW
data set are listed in Table 2. No significant difference was
observed between patients taking an ACEI/ARB and
those not taking these medications with respect to the
type of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (P 5 .11), the duration of radiation therapy (P 5 .84), the total dose of radiation therapy (P 5 .56), the time from neoadjuvant
treatment to surgery (P 5 .34), or the use of adjuvant
chemotherapy (P 5 .48; Table 2). Although no difference

the 2 groups (Table 1), the cohort taking ACEIs/ARBs

5 .57), sex (P 5 .21), pretreatment hemoglobin (P 5

.60), or biopsy grade (P 5 .44; Table 3).
Similarly to the patients in the UW database,
patients in the UH data set who were taking ACEI/ARB
medications experienced a significant 2-fold increase in
the rate of pCR to neoadjuvant therapy in comparison
with those not taking these medications (24% vs 12%,
P 5 .03; Fig. 2A). The mean duration of radiotherapy
was approximately 38 days for both groups (P 5 .84), and
there was no significant difference in either the total dose
of radiation therapy (P 5 .62) or the time from radiotherapy completion to surgery (P 5 .34). In the KaplanMeier analysis, ACEI/ARB use did not significantly affect
LR-free survival (P 5 .43), metastasis-free survival (P 5

Multivariate analyses were performed with the aggregate
UW and UH data. In this combined data set, ACEI/

ACEIs/ARBs Affect Response in Rectal Cancer/Morris et al

DISCUSSION
In 2 independent databases from very distinct rectal cancer patient populations, we report a significant positive
correlation between the use of ACEI/ARB medications
and pCR rates after neoadjuvant treatment (Figs. 1A and
2A). This effect was robust, and ACEI/ARB use was associated with 3- and 2-fold–enhanced rates of pCR in the
UW and UH data sets, respectively. In the multivariate
analysis, the use of ACEIs/ARBs more strongly predicted
the likelihood of a pCR than the clinical stage or biopsy
grade did (Table 4). Although the inclusion criteria for
the design of this study specified patients undergoing neoadjuvant radiation, the frequent use of concurrent chemoradiation in the UW and UH data sets precluded our
ability to determine whether the impact of ACEI/ARB
use on pCR rates in this study might be mediated through
an effect on tumor responses to radiation, chemotherapy,
or both.
Patient and treatment characteristics were well balanced in both the UW database and the UH database
between the cohort of patients who were taking ACEIs/
ARBs and those not taking these medications. This list of
identified covariates includes parameters such as the time
to surgery and the pretreatment levels of CEA and hemoglobin, which have previously been identified as predictors of pCR in rectal cancer.24-27 In contrast to ACEIs/
ARBs, other medications, including aspirin, statins, glitazones, and metformin, did not significantly affect pCR
rates among rectal cancer patients, although patients taking these medications experienced nonsignificant trends
toward higher pCR rates (Supporting Fig. 1 [see online
supporting information]). These data support a potentially specific therapeutic effect for ACEIs/ARBs and
argues against a confounding effect, although the impact
of untested covariates, including comorbid medical conditions, cannot be excluded.
In these data sets, the use of ACEIs/ARBs did not
significantly affect LR-free survival, metastasis-free survival, or OS. Prior studies have consistently identified a
positive association between pCR and improved rates of
locoregional disease control and OS.28-31 However, in
these databases from UW and UH, the association of
pCR with LR and OS rates did not reach significance.
This suggests that our 2 data sets were underpowered with
respect to patient numbers and/or the duration of followup for the purpose of detecting an association between
ACEI/ARB use and LR or OS. Such associations were not
considered primary endpoints in the design of this study.
However, we do believe that if we had a greater number of
patients in our database or additional databases, we would

have the power necessary to detect significant changes in
LR and OS rates. Indeed, the aggregate data set combining the UW and UH data suggests a trend of increased OS
and LR-free survival in rectal cancer patients with a pCR
to neoadjuvant therapy (Supporting Fig. 2 [see online
supporting information]).
The mechanism by which ACEI/ARB therapy may
lead to improved pCR rates is not well understood. It is
biologically plausible that ACEIs/ARBs might affect the
response to neoadjuvant therapy among patients with rectal cancer. Prior studies suggest that ACEIs/ARBs may
affect vascular remodeling by suppressing vascular endothelial growth factor production and improving defective
angiogenesis.21-34 In the context of malignancy, multiple
preclinical studies indicate that ineffective angiogenesis in
tumors results in poor vascularization and leads to
impaired perfusion and oxygenation with a resultant relative resistance to radiation and many chemotherapeutics.22 It is, therefore, possible that ACEIs/ARBs may
antagonize aberrant angiogenesis within a tumor and that
this may result in a pruning effect that could reduce vascular leakiness and thereby improve tumor perfusion and
pCR rates after neoadjuvant treatment.
An alternative mechanism for how ACEIs/ARBs
may increase pCR rates in rectal cancer patients after neoadjuvant therapy could be related to the role of ACEIs/
ARBs in modulating dysregulated inflammation and macrophage activity.7 Macrophages may have a protumor
effect when they are localized within the necrotic center of
colorectal tumors but may confer an antitumor effect
when they are concentrated at the tumor periphery.35 It is
plausible that ACEIs/ARBs affect macrophages within the
colorectal tumor microenvironment and that this could
affect pCR rates to neoadjuvant therapy. Ongoing and
anticipated studies examining biopsy and surgical pathology specimens from patients in our UW and UH databases may shed further light on these potential
mechanisms.
The potential for ACEIs/ARBs to positively affect
tumor responses to chemoradiation is all the more remarkable when it is placed in the context of prior studies
showing a role for these agents in reducing certain normal
tissue toxicities after radiation.15-21 The specific molecular
and cellular mechanisms that may underlie this dichotomy remain obscure. We do not observe an effect of
ACEIs/ARBs on radiation-related toxicities in the current
study. However, prior preclinical studies have also not
observed an effect of these medications on the gastrointestinal side effects of radiation,36 which are likely to predominate in our patient population.

Original Article

In conclusion, we present evidence from 2 independent and diverse patient data sets demonstrating a positive association between the use of ACEIs/ARBs and
pCR after neoadjuvant treatment of rectal cancer. A weakness of this study is that this evidence is derived from retrospective data sets. In light of the low cost and
established safety of ACEIs/ARBs, a prospective investigation is warranted to evaluate the capacity of these agents
to enhance tumor responses to chemoradiation therapy in
patients with rectal cancer.
