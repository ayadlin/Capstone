ABSTRACT
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a sub-population of cells within cancer tissues
with tumor initiation, drug resistance and metastasis properties. CSCs also have
been considered as the main cause of cancer recurrence. Targeting CSCs have been
suggested as the key for successful treatment against cancer. Tumorsphere cultivation
is based on culturing cancer cells onto ultralow attachment surface in serum-free
media under the supplementation with growth factors such as epidermal growth
factor and basic fibroblast growth factor. Tumorsphere cultivation is widely used
to analyze the self-renewal capability of CSCs and to enrich these cells from bulk
cancer cells. This method also provides a reliable platform for screening potential
anti-CSC agents. The in vitro anti-proliferation activity of potential agents selected
from tumorsphere assay is more translatable into in vivo anti-tumorigenic activity
compared with general monolayer culture. Tumorsphere assay can also measure the
outcome of clinical trials for potential anti-cancer agents. In addition, tumorsphere
assay may be a promising strategy in the innovation of future cancer therapeutica
and may help in the screening of anti-cancer small-molecule chemicals.

INTRODUCTION

CSCs are a sub-population of cancer cells with properties
of tumor initiation. CSC propagate through asymmetric
division; similarly, differentiated daughter cells form
tumor bulk [3] and normal stem cells differentiate into
multiple cell types within a tissue or organ via asymmetric
division. CSCs hijack the cellular mechanisms in the
maintenance of self-renewal property of normal stem cells
to maintain the high tumorigenicity of these cancer cells
[4]. CSCs targeting has been considered as the key for
successful cancer treatment with the increasing relapse
rate of cancers toward current chemo or radiotherapy and
the link between CSCs and drug resistance of cancers [5].

Cancers consist of several varieties of cell types
such as cancer cells, stroma cells, endothelial cells, and
immune cells; cancers are considered as tissues with
heterogeneity [1]. Phenotypic and functional diversity
arise among cancer cells. In the past two decades, the
identification of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and the power
of these cells in the establishment of new tumors during
experimental implant in animal hosts [2] enabled CSCs
to gain much attention in the field of cancer research.

CSCs were demonstrated to be resistant to gemcitabineinduced apoptosis [25], the drug frequently used to treat
pancreatic cancer patients. We have demonstrated that
silencing of heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) or treatment of
HSP inhibitors potentiated breast CSCs to the suppressive
effect of Hsp90 inhibitors [26]. Recent study also reveals
that tumor transforming factor (TGF)-β signaling in
squamous cell carcinoma CSCs enhanced glutathione
metabolism and decreased the efficacy of anti-cancer
drugs [27]. The invasive phenotype of cancer cells is
driven through the epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) program [28]. Induction of EMT in immortalized
human mammary epithelial cells by EMT-related
transcriptional factors (twist or snail) or TGF-β1 could
increase the expression of CD24-CD44+ [29].CD24-CD44+
breast CSCs isolated from primary human breast cancer
specimens and expressed markers associated with EMT
[29]. The direct regulation of Bmi1 by twist, one of the
regulatory transcriptional factors in EMT process, has been
demonstrated that these two molecules could cooperate to
promote the EMT process and tumor initiation capacity
of head and neck squamous carcinoma cells (HNSCC)
[30]. We have previously shown that Hsp27 regulated the
self-renewal of breast CSCs and controlled their invasive
phenotype through downregulation of snail [31]. Wettstein
et al. further supported our finding by demonstrating that
the inhibition of Hsp27 promoted snail degradation and
prevented TGF-β induced EMT [32]. Hermann et al.
discovered that CXCR4 expression in CD133+ pancreatic
CSCs determined the metastatic potential to liver without
affecting their tumor initiation capability [33], which
presented the concept of metastatic CSCs. Recently, Gao
et al. discovered that knockdown of CD44, a marker for

The first experimental description of CSCs was
demonstrated in a leukemia study in 1997 by John Dick’s
group [6]. Only a subset of acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) cells could transfer AML from patients to nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/
SCID) mouse hosts [6]. These AML-initiating cells were
found to carry the cell surface markers of CD34+CD38similar to normal haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)
[6], implying that normal HSCs are the cell origin of
leukaemic transformation. The identification of AMLCSCs led scientists to search corresponding CSCs in solid
tumors, including brain [7], breast [8-11], colon [12],
head and neck [13], liver [14], lung [15], ovarian [16],
pancreatic [17], and prostate [18], as summarized in Table
1.
The characteristics of CSCs include tumor initiation,
resistance to chemo or radiotherapy, metastasis and
involvement of tumor vascularization. The propagation
of CSCs to maintain the tumor initiation ability refers
to self-renewal of CSCs [3] and signaling pathways in
maintenance of self-renewal of normal stem cells are also
found to be activated in CSCs, including B lymphoma
Mo-MLV insertion region 1 homolog (Bmi1) [19], sex
determining region Y-box 2 (Sox2 )[20], Wnt/β-catenin
[21] and octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4)
[22]. CD24-CD44+ breast CSCs were noted to be more
resistant to radiation than non-CSCs [23]; and these cells
not only survived radiation treatment but also induced into
the active cell cycle to proliferate [24]. CD133+ pancreatic

CSCs of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), diminished the
metastatic ability in the experimental mouse model [34].
This work demonstrated the function of CSC marker in
the regulation of metastasis. CSCs could also contribute
to tumor vascularization. The CD44+ ovarian cancer cells
have been determined to transdifferentiate into endothelial
progenitor cells (EPCs). When CD44+ ovarian cells
were cultured with Matrigel, these cells expressed EPC
marker CD34 through a vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) independent inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B
kinase β (IKKβ)-dependent mechanism [35]. Wang et al.
observed that a subpopulation of CD133+ glioma CSCs
expressed the marker of vascular endothelial-cadherin
(CD144), which displayed characteristics of endothelial
progenitors [36]. Blocking the VEGF signaling pathway
suppressed the maturation of these tumor endothelial
progenitors (CD133+CD144+) into endothelium; and
the inhibition of Notch signaling pathway abolished the
transition of glioma CSCs into endothelial progenitors
[36]. Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) is another type of tumor
vascularization that forms vessel-like channels by tumor
cells without the involvement of endothelial cells [37].
Liu et al. demonstrated that CD133+ MDA-MB-231 cells,
which have been demonstrated as CSCs in Brca1-deficient
mouse mammary tumors [38], formed VM structures in
triple negative breast cancer tissues [39]. These reports
suggested that CSCs may support tumor vascularization
through direct transdifferentiation into endothelial cells,
EPCs or through the VM mechanism.
CSCs are considered as a small population of cancer
cells within a bulk tumor mass. The first and essential
step in studying CSCs is to separate them from the entire
tumor population. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) is the first method to isolate CSCs and is based
on the differential expression of cell surface markers by
labeling CSCs with fluorescent-conjugated antibodies
and isolating by FACS cell sorter. The identification of
AML-CSCs or breast CSCs by CD34+CD38- [6] or CD24CD44+ [8] surface markers, respectively, is the two top
known examples. In addition to surface markers, FACS
could also be applied to fluorescent-based substrates such
as BODIPY aminoacetaldehyde (Aldefluor substrate)
for isolation of cells with intracellular ALDH activity
(ALDHbright cells); these subpopulation of cancer cells
have been identified as CSCs in several types of cancers
[40]. Side population (SP) analysis is also a method in
applying FACS isolation of CSCs, which is based on the
efflux of Hoechst 33342 fluorescent dye [41]. Although SP
analysis is considered as an alternative marker to isolate
CSCs with no known surface markers, Broadley et al.
reported that SP cells were insufficient for CSC phenotype
in glioblastoma multiforme [42]. The other fluorescencebased isolation of CSCs is dependent on the cellular
proteasome activity. Vlashi et al. first demonstrated that
the use of the fluorescence protein ZsGreen fused to the
carboxylterminal degron of ornithine decarboxylase
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to differentiate the intracellular proteasome activity
among cells, CSCs of human glioma or breast cancer
cells displayed a phenotype of reduced 26S proteasome
activity [43]. The reduced 26S proteasome activity of
CSCs has been also observed in HNSCCs [44]. Although
FACS-based isolation of CSCs seems to be promising,
the limitation or disadvantage of CSC isolation by FACS
is the availability of fluorescent-conjugated antibodies
or substrates as well as the high cost of cell sorter.
FACS-based isolation of potential CSCs requires further
functional examinations to approve their CSC properties,
such as in vivo tumorigenicity, in vitro drug resistance,
cell invasion behavior, or self-renewal capability through
tumorsphere assay.
Compared with FACS-based method, isolation of
CSCs through tumorsphere cultivation does not require
a background knowledge on cell surface markers.
Tumorsphere cultivation for CSC isolation was first
described by Singh et al. in brain tumors [45], a culture
method originally used to isolate neural stem cells
[46]. In the study of neural stem cells, the formation
of neurospheres was considered as an assay of selfrenewal capability according to further examination of
the multilineage differentiation ability of these floating
spheroid cells [46]. This stem cell cultivation method is
based on plating single cell suspension at a proper cell
density on ultralow attachment surface with the serumfree culture medium in supplementation with several
defined growth factors such as epidermal growth factor
(EGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and neural
survival factor [47]. Tumorspheres derived from human
primary brain tumor specimens expressed markers of
neural stem cells (CD133 and nestin) and could further
induce multilineage differentiation into neuronal cells or
astrocytes . In 2005, Ponti et al. applied the mammosphere
cultivation method in in vitro propagation of mammary
stem/progenitor cells to isolate breast CSCs from primary
breast cancer specimens and established human breast
cancer cell lines [48]. Mammospheres derived from
breast cancer cells expressed CD24-CD44+ markers and
displayed a great tumorigenicity when xenotransplanted
into mammary fat pads of NOD/SCID mice [48]. To date,
tumorspheres are successfully cultured from varieties
of cancers such as colon [49], HNSCC [50], lung [51],
pancreatic [52], prostate [53], melanoma [54], ovarian [55]
and thyroid [56] cancer. Tumorsphere cultivation is widely
accepted as a functional assay of self-renewal property of
CSCs [47].

TUMORSPHERES DISPLAY ALL THE
CHARACTERISTICS OF CANCER STEM

been proven to display characteristics of CSCs. Dieter
et al. applied tumorsphere cultivation to analyze the

colon cancer cells-derived tumorspheres stimulated the in
vitro tube formation of EPCs from human umbilical cord
blood through secretion of VEGF [68]. Tumor microvessel
density was significantly higher in tumors derived from C6
rat glioma tumorspheres compared with cells cultured as
monolayer, which was mediated by VEGF and stromalderive factor-1 secreted by tumorspheres [69]. When
melanoma tumorspheres grown on Matrigel matrices, the
developed laminin-associated networks were negative
with the expression of CD31 and positive with CD144
indicating the feature of VM [70]. These laminin networks
within melanoma tumorspheres were diminished by
knockdown of nestin [70]. We previously demonstrated
that mammospheres derived from human breast cancer
cells displayed VM activity when plated on a Matrigel
coated surface [71]. The VM activity of breast CSCs was
mediated by EGF-induced Hsp27 phosphorylation [71].
These results support that tumorsphere cells could be
considered as the enrichment of CSCs according to the
capability to contribute to tumor vascularization

cellular heterogeneity within colon CSCs [57]. The
frequency of sphere-forming cells in the entire human
primary colon cancer cells was low but the formed colon
tumorspheres displayed a significant tumorigeneicity
when xenotransplanted into the kidney capsule of
immunodeficient IL2RG−/− mice compared with fresh
tumor cells derived from the respective original tumor
sample [57]. Coulon et al. also demonstrated that human
neuroblastoma cells selected by tumorsphere cultivation
displayed increased in vivo tumorigenicity in orthotopic
microenvironment compared with cells propagated in the
presence of 10% serum [58]. In the genetically engineered
mouse model of breast cancer, 1000 dissociated cells
from 3-week-old tumorspheres derived from tumors of
mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-Neu or MMTVWnt mice could form tumors when transplanted into the
mammary fat pads of Rag-/- mice [59]. Morrison et al. also
demonstrated that tumorsphere forming cells in murine
ling cancer cell lines were more tumorigenic than adherent
cells in the syngeneic host [60]. These reports demonstrate
that tumorsphere cells display capability in tumor
initiation. CSCs are known to display highly invasive
phenotype, which is driven through the EMT program
[61]. Lichner et al. found that tumorspheres derived from
renal cell carcinoma cells showed elevated expression
of mesenchymal markers [62]. Tumorspheres derived
from human ovarian cancer cell lines displayed a greater
in vitro invasive ability and in vivo metastasis than their
parental counterparts [55]. We have also demonstrated
that tumorspheres derived from HNSCC cells displayed
EMT signatures such as low expression of epithelial
marker E-cadherin and high expression of mesenchymal
markers such as vimentin, Slug and zinc finger E-boxbinding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) [63]. Nonaka et al. found
an elevated invasive ability in tumorspheres derived from
RSV-M mouse glioma cells associated with the differential
expression of metastatic genes [64]. In addition, tumor
cells from metastatic site have been reported to be more
easily engrafted in immunocompromised mice than those
from the primary site. Lee et al. demonstrated that brain
metastases of non-small cell lung cancer showed an
increased successful rate in the establishment of patient
derived xenografts (PDXs) than primary specimens [65].
Tumorspheres from these PDXs were shown to maintain
their brain metastatic feature [65]. These reports illustrate
the invasive property of tumorsphere cells. Tumorspheres
derived from a poor differentiated human HCC cell line
were determined to be resistant to several anti-cancer
drugs, which was associated with the elevated expression
of ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 [66]. The
resistance of doxorubicin was observed in mammospheres
derived from MCF7 breast cancer cells and was associated
with p62-mediated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor
2 activation [67]. These reports establish that tumorpsheres
display the capability to resist therapy, which is also one of
the features of CSC. The supernatant of HCT116 or HT29

TUMORSPHERES AS A RELIABLE
ASSAY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF
ANTI-CANCER AGENTS
Concepts: The discovery of anti-cancer agents is
typically by examining the in vitro cytotoxic effect of rapid
proliferation cancer cells in 2-dimension (2D) adherent
condition. After identifying CSCs, the heterogeneity of
tumor cells in response to anti-cancer agents becomes an
important issue in drug screening. As described above,
drug resistance is one of the main features of CSCs and
a mechanism of tumor relapse. Identifying agents with
anti-CSC activity has been considered as the key for a
successful cancer therapy [3-5]. In addition, phenotypic
heterogeneity occurs in the CSC population. For example,
the markers of breast CSCs have been described as
CD24-CD44+ [8] or ALDHbright [10]. CD24-CD44+ cells
without ALDH activity could not form tumors when
xenotransplanted into mammary fat pads of NOD/SCID
mice [10]. The existence of heterogeneity among CSCs
indicates that analyzing the expression of CSC markers in
response to potential anti-cancer agents may not a suitable
assay to determine their anti-CSC activity. In contrast to
2D monolayer method or analyzing the change of CSC
markers, tumorsphere assay is considered as a more
reliable platform in the discovery of anti-CSC agents.
Significance: Tumorsphere assay has been widely
accepted ro determine self-renewal capability in studying
CSC biology. Examining the in vitro anti-self-renewal
activity of potential anti-cancer agents by tumorsphere
assay could reflect their in vivo anti-tumorigenic activity.
Morrison et al. used proteomic analysis to compare
proteome between MCF7 cells derived from tumorspheres
and 2D monolayer culture and results revealed that
galectin-3 was overexpressed in MCF7 tumorspheres
1218

Oncotarget

[60]. N-acetyllactosamine, an inhibitor of galectin-3,
both inhibited in vitro tumorsphere formation and in vivo
tumorigenicity of MCF7 cells [60]. Hongisto et al. found
that drug sensitivity to 102 anti-cancer compounds between
2D monolayer cultured cells and tumorspheres derived
from JIMT1 breast cancer cells was different; when
compared the gene expression profiles in different culture
methods, tumorspheres derived from Matrigel coated
surface showed most closely resembled to xenografted
tumors [72]. It strongly suggests that tumorsphere assay
is more suitable than 2D monolayer method in screening
anti-cancer agents. Kim et al. compared the antiproliferation activity between doxorubicin and paclitaxel
in carcinogen-induced primary murine tumor cells with
monolayer or tumorsphere assay [73]. Two chemotherapy
drugs displayed a similar anti-proliferation activity in
monolayer culture; however, doxorubicin showed a better
anti-proliferation activity than paclitaxel in tumorsphere
assay [73]. Such differences may result from the different
gene expression files between cells derived from 2D
monolayer or tumorsphere method as Hongisto et al.
observed [72] or the different chemical properties among
compounds. Indeed, doxorubicin displayed a greater in
vivo anti-tumor activity than paclitaxel when tested using
tumor cell transplantation mouse model [73]. These results
provide evidence to support that tumorsphere assay is a
more translatable platform than 2D monolayer method in
screening anti-cancer agents.
Feasibility: Established human cancer cell lines or
primary tumor cells isolated from enzymatic digestion of
cancer patient biopsy could be used as initial materials for
CSC enrichment through tumorsphere cultivation without
any background knowledge in CSC-specific markers. The
cultivation of tumorspheres could be easily conducted in
laboratories with their own cell culture equipment but no
FACS cell sorter.
Methodology/strategy: Ultralow attachment culture
surface is required for tumorsphere cultivation, which
can be purchased from commercial companies or homemade by coating tissue culture plates/dishes with 1%
agar [74] , polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate polymer as
12% (w/v) [75], or growth factor reduced Matrigel [72].
Although tumorsphere assay is a relatively low-cost
method in screening of anti-cancer agents or in the study
of CSC biology, the culture conditions of tumorsphere
may influence the interpretation of the results. For
example, the initial seeding cell number is important
should be carefully distinguished between tumorspheres
or cell aggregates. To avoid cell aggregation, filtering
cell preparation is suggested with 40 µm cell strainer to
obtain single-cell suspension before seeding; cell density
should be less than 10 cells/µL [76]. We also recommend
the addition of methylcellulose with concentration
of 0.5% to 1% in tumorsphere culture medium o
prevent cell aggregation. The cultivation condition of
tumorsphere may be cancer type-dependent. Although
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the tumorsphere assay used in most studies is based on
serum-free condition under the supplement of EGF and
bFGF, several reports also included low concentration of
serum. Cao et al. demonstrated that fetal bovine serum
and β-mercaptoethanol were essential for the tumorsphere
formation of mouse neuroblastoma cells derived from
MYCN transgenic mice [77]. Matrigel could also be
benefit in tumorsphere formation, especially for quiescent
CSCs [76]. When counting the number of tumorspheres,
the diameter of tumorspheres must be observed. A floating
cell clump with a diameter less than 50 µm should not
be considered as a tumorsphere. Testing the drug effect
is highly suggested by applying a secondary tumorsphere
formation with dissociated single-cell suspension from
primary tumorspheres. The use of a 100 µm cell strainer
to obtain spheres with a diameter large than 50 µm is
recommended for the collection of primary tumorspheres.
The results of tumorsphere assay could be displayed as the
changes of total number or size of formed tumorspheres.
The CSC characteristics of formed tumorspheres should
be determined before using the tumorsphere assay as the
platform in screening anti-CSC agents. Tumorigenicity
is the most important feature to be examined. Others
include the expression of self-renewal-related genes (i.e.
Bmi1, Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, etc.), invasive phenotype,
and resistance to conventional chemotherapy drugs or
radiation.
Recent progress/examples: Zhou et al. demonstrated
that 8-quinolinol preferentially inhibited the sphere
formation capability of MCF7 breast cancer cells and
displayed a better therapeutic effect and relapse prevention
when combination with paclitaxel in MCF7 xenograft
mouse model [78]. By using tumorsphere assay, we have
demonstrated that quercetin, a plant flavonoid compound,
inhibited the self-renewal capability of HNC-CSCs
through the downregulation of stemness genes (Oct4,
Nanog, nestin) and mesenchymal markers (vimentin,
N-cadherin, Twist) [79]. Quercetin also displayed an antiCSC activity in breast cancer cells through downregulation
of Hsp27 expression [31]. We also discovered that
resveratrol
(3,4’,5-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene),
a
polyphenolic compound primarily isolated from red wine,
could inhibit tumorsphere formation in the in vitro and
in vivo tumorigenicity of HNC-CSCs through induction
of apoptosis of HNC-CSCs [63]. Wen et al. reported
a phase II trial of buparlisib, a phosphatidyinositol-3
kinase inhibitor, which has been demonstrated to inhibit
the growth of human glioma tumorsphere in recurrent
glioblastoma patients. Buparlisib was discovered to be
well-tolerated in patients and showed reduction of Akt
phosphorylation in 4/6 of evaluable patients [80]. Applying
Yamanaka factors to reprogram immortalized mammary
epithelial cell line MCF10A, Nishi et al. recently reported
a method to establish induced CSC-like cells for in vitro
screening of potential anti-CSC agents [81]. Withaferin A,
an Ayurvedic medicine constituent, displayed an activity

in reduction of stemness and self-renewal capability,
which determined by alkaline phosphatase activity
and tumorsphere formation with minimal effect in cell
viability by 2D culture and WST-8 assay [81]. This report
demonstrated the advantage of tumorsphere cultivation

when compared with the 2D monolayer method in current
development of anti-cancer drugs or cancer vaccine. For
example, tumorsphere assay is used as one of outcome
measurements in a clinical trial to evaluate the effect of
mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1/2 (TORC1/2)

Figure 1: Suggested screening flowchart in the discovery of anti-CSC agents with tumorsphere assay. The source of

primary tumorspheres can be the established cancer cell lines or primary cancer cells from enzymatic dissociated cancer tissues. Primary
tumorspheres could be collected by 100 µm cell strainer and processed to lysate preparation for identification of CSC-specific tumor
antigens through dendritic cell presentation and T cell stimulating property. The primary tumorspheres could also be enzymatic dissociated
into single cell suspension for secondary tumorsphere formation examination. The potential anti-CSC agents could be tested at this stage.
The effects of potential agents will be determined by counting the number and/or the size of formed secondary tumorspheres. The agent with
the ability to reduce secondary tumorsphere formation can be selected; the in vivo anti-tumorigenic effect of the agent can be determined;
and a study on the molecular mechanisms in targeting CSCs can be conducted. Clinical evaluations can be further conducted after obtaining
the results of CSC-specific antigen discovery or anti-tumor efficacy of selected anti-CSC agents. CSC, cancer stem cells; DCs, dendritic

TOCR1/2 inhibitors, BEZ235 or INK128, enhanced the
mammosphere formation of triple negative breast cancer
cells through activation of Notch signaling pathway [82].
This finding implies that the combination of Notch and
TORC1/2 inhibitors should be considered in the clinical
trials of TORC1/2 inhibitors for triple negative breast
cancer. The involvement of tumorsphere assay in clinical
trials is summarized in Table 2.

activity in binding and anti-proliferation effect to brain
tumorspheres [92]. Snyder et al. recently demonstrated
that the expression of podocalyxin in breast cancer cells
is required for the formation of mammospheres; and
podpcalyxin antibodies displayed a therapeutic potential
to block tumor growth and metastasis in vivo [93]. The
immune responses in against CSCs can only be studied
in immunocompetent host. The identification of CSCs
in murine tumor cell lines provides a good model to
investigate the tumor immunology and immunotherapy
of CSCs. Morrison et al. discovered that tumorspheres
derived from HM-LLC murine Lewis lung carcinoma
cells displayed CSC properties [60]. We have also shown
that Sca-1+ 4T1 murine breast cancer cells could formed
tumorspheres and are highly tumorigenic when compared
with Sca-1- counterparts [94]. The discovery of murine
CSCs provides an opportunity to further understand the
immunology of CSCs and develop immunotherapy to
target CSCs. Recently, Xu et al. demonstrated that the
expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) was
elevated in tumor-propagating cells in a mouse model of
lung squamous cell carcinoma, which was induced by
biallelic inactivation of Lkb1 and Pten [95]. Such results
indicate that the need for testing the application of antiPD-L1 therapy in breaking down the immune suppression
tumor microenvironment. Tumorsphere cultivation also
provides an advantage in establishing short-term patientderived cancer cell lines for the clinical evaluation
of dendritic cell-based immunotherapy. Wang et al.
conducted a phase I clinical trial of immunotherapy in the
treatment of HCC patients with autologous dendritic cells
with patient-derived tumorspheres [96]. The efficiency
rate for short-term patient-derived HCC tumor cells with
tumorsphere cultivation in the clinical trial of Wang et
al. was 100%, whereas the successful rate using standard
tissue culture techniques was only less than 50% [96].
Figure 1 shows our view on tumorsphere assaybased discovery of anti-CSC agents. Established human
cancer cell lines or primary tumor cells isolated from
enzymatic digestion of cancer patient biopsy could be
used as the initial materials for CSC enrichment through
tumorsphere cultivation (primary tumorspheres). After
the dissociation of formed primary tumorspheres, CSCs
will be obtained and can be used to examine the anti-selfrenewal activity of potential agents by testing the effect
in the formation of secondary tumorspheres. Agents
with disruption on secondary tumorspheres formation
can be selected for further examination of the antitumorigenicity activity in immunocompomised mouse
model and investigation of the underlying molecular
mechanisms by cDNA microarray or protein array-based
pathway screening. Moreover, the enriched CSCs from
primary tumorspheres can be used as the source of CSCspecific antigens. Through dendritic cell presentation and
capability analysis in stimulating T cell proliferation/
activation, CSC-specific antigens could be identified. The

APPLICATION OF TUMORSPHERE
CULTIVATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT
OF CANCER IMMUNOTHERAPY
Recently, cancer immunotherapy is considered
to provide great potential in future cancer therapy [83].
However, CSCs have been reported to escape from antitumor immunity. Schatton and Frank found that the tumorassociated antigen (TAA) MART-1 was not expressed on
the surface of ABCB5+ melanoma CSCs [84]. Busse et al.
compared the expression of TAAs between tumorspheres
and the parental adherent cell lines and found no obvious
difference in the expression of TAAs; however, the
downregulation of major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) molecules was observed in tumorspheres [85].
Wu et al. discovered that breast CSCs were resistant to
the cytotoxic killing by autologous or allogenic natural
killer (NK) cells which were mediated by microRNA20a-induced downregulation of MICA and MICB, two
ligands for the NK activating receptor NKG2D [86].
Another report demonstrated that CD133+ glioma CSCs
did not express MHC class I or NK cell activating
ligands indicating that these cells were resistant to the
surveillances of adaptive and innate immunity [87].
MCF7 cells that survived from NK cells-mediated
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity showed
CSC phenotypes including CD24-CD44+ markers and
mammosphere formation capability [88]. CSCs from
transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate expressed
Tenascin-C to inhibit T cell receptor restricted T cell
proliferation by interacting with integrin α5β1 expressed
on surface of T cells [89]. Although the immune evasion
property of CSCs is being reported, other reports provided
evidence that inducing CSC-specific immune responses is
possible. Visus et al. using ALDHA1 peptide to generate
ALDHAl-specific CD8+ T cells and demonstrated that
these T cells killed more than 70% of ALDHbright cells in
established human carcinoma cell lines [90]. Adoptive
transfer of ALDHA1-specific T cells inhibited xenograft
tumor growth in immunodeficient mice model [90]. By
using tumorspheres as the source of tumor antigen, Xu et
al. demonstrated that vaccination of dendritic cells with
irradiated glioma tumorspheres increased the survival
rate of mice with tumor [91]. Zhu et al. discovered
an internalizing human single chain antibody with

results from in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of the selected
anti-CSC agents or the identified CSC-specific antigens
could be used as background knowledge for clinical
evaluation trials. At this stage, tumorsphere assay could
serve as one of the outcome measures.

For the past decades, CSCs have been identified in
several types of cancers. This specific subpopulation of
cancer cells participates in tumor initiation, resistance to
treatment, metastasis, and tumor vascularization; the key
for a success cancer therapy is to target CSCs. Cancer cells
capable of forming tumorspheres share characteristics with
CSCs. Such kind of cultivation method leads scientists
to study the biology of CSCs without any background
knowledge on CSC markers. Tumorsphere assay could
also serve as a reliable platform both in the innovation of
anti-CSC agents and the development of CSC-targeting
immunothersapy. Several reports have been shown that
the screening results from tumorsphere cultivation are
more reliable than those from 2D monolayer methods
[73, 81]. Given that the immune evasion features of CSCs
in some cancer types result from the downregulation of
MHC molecules, enhancing the antigen presentation
in CSCs must be considered during the development of
CSC-targeting immunotherapy. Moreover, understanding
the expression of immune checkpoint molecules, such as
PD-L1 or indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase , in tumorspheres
of each cancer types can provide useful information when
applying immune checkpoint therapeutics against cancers.
We believe that tumorsphere assay based-drug discovery
of anti-cancer agents will provide more translatable results
compared with those obtained from the traditional 2D
monolayer culture system.
