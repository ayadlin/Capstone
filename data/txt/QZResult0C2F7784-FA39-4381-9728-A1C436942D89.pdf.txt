Abstract
In acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), leukemic cell-microenvironment interactions within various niches (stromal/
osteoblastic or sinusoidal endothelial cell niches) have a role
in leukemia cell survival and drug resistance. The AML
leukemic cells express platelet/endothelial cell adhesion
molecule–1 (CD31) and CD38, two adhesion molecules that
could interact with microenvironmental elements, i.e., CD31
on the surface of marrow endothelial cells (CD31/CD31 and
CD38/CD31 interactions) and hyaluronate (CD38/hyaluronate
interactions). We report a physical association of these two
antigens on the plasma membrane of myeloid leukemic cells.
In this context, in vitro experiments done using interactionblocking anti-CD31 and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies
(CLB-HEC75 and OKT10, respectively) indicate that an excess
of CD31 on the cell membrane of leukemic cells (CD31/CD38
MFI ratio >1) promotes a homotypic interaction with marrow
endothelial cells, resulting in higher transendothelial migration. Conversely, an excess of CD38 (CD31/CD38 MFI ratio <1)
allows leukemic cells to be entrapped within the bone marrow
microenvironment through hyaluronate adhesion. The results
obtained in vitro using fluorescence resonance energy transfer, co-capping, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments,
and hyaluronate adhesion and transendothelial migration
assays, are supported by immunophenotypic characterization
of marrow leukemic cells from 78 AML patients on which
CD38 expression levels were found to be positively correlated
with those of CD31. Importantly, the excess of CD31 in those
samples was associated with a higher peripheral WBC count.
These findings indicate that bone marrow retention of AML
cells depends on CD31 and CD38 coexpression levels. [Cancer

Introduction
Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is characterized by
uncontrolled proliferation within the bone marrow of malignant
myeloid progenitors and the egress of these abnormal cells into
the circulation. A major problem in the treatment of AML
remains the recurrence of the pathology following chemotherapy,
which is due to resistant leukemic cells localized in the bone

marrow. It has been shown that cell-cell or cell-matrix adhesion
processes are involved in chemoresistance (1). The retention of
leukemic cells in the bone marrow compartment is controlled by
interactions between the cells and elements of the marrow
microenvironment.
In vivo, marrow endothelial cells play an important role in the
trafficking of hematopoietic cells by acting as gatekeepers
separating the stroma from the sinusoidal lumen. The marrow
vascular niche consists of a network of thin-walled and fenestrated
sinusoidal vessels. Venous sinusoids are the site of large-scale
traffic of cells between the extravascular hematopoietic compartment and the blood stream. In comparison with typical basement
membranes in other tissues, the marrow sinusoidal basement
membrane has a discontinuous nature, lacking network organization. Moreover, this membrane presents an exceptionally large
quantity of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG; ref. 2). This
structural organization promotes the interactions between the
hematopoietic cells and the marrow endothelium.
The CD31 and CD38 cell surface antigens are expressed in all
AML subtypes, but their expression varies considerably from one
patient to another. Human platelet/endothelial cell adhesion
molecule–1 belongs to the immunoglobulin gene superfamily (3).
It is expressed on endothelial cells and AML cells and has been
identified as having a role in transendothelial migration via
homophilic interaction (4). Human CD38 is a transmembrane
glycoprotein present on AML cells whose extracellular domain
contains an enzymatic site that can generate cyclic ADP ribose
(cADPR) and ADPR from nicotine adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)
and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) from
NADP+ (5). Moreover, three hyaluronate-binding sites have been
reported in CD38, two of which existing in the extracellular domain
of this antigen (6). CD31 and CD38 are known to be ligands of
CD31 in homophilic and heterophilic interactions (7). Because
CD31 is expressed on the entire endothelial cell surface and CSPG
is able to complex with hyaluronate (8, 9), we postulated that the
balanced control between extramedullary dissemination and
marrow retention of leukemic cells may depend on the cell surface
expression of CD31 and CD38 on leukemic cells via CD31/CD31
interactions with the vascular wall and CD38/hyaluronate interactions with the extracellular matrix.
In the present study, we report that CD38 and CD31 are
important for leukemic cell trafficking in AML. We show a physical
association of these two antigens on the plasma membrane of
leukemic cells. In this context, an excess of CD31 (CD31/CD38 ratio
>1) promotes a homotypic interaction with marrow endothelial
cells, resulting in higher transendothelial migration. Conversely, an
excess of CD38 (CD31/CD38 ratio <1) allows leukemic cells to be

entrapped within the marrow microenvironment through adhesion
to hyaluronate. The strategy adopted for this study included the
analysis of the distribution of CD38 and CD31 on the cell surface,
the effects of CD38 overexpression on the in vitro adhesion to
hyaluronate, and the effects of anti-CD31 and anti-CD38 blocking
monoclonal antibodies (mAb) on the in vitro adhesion to marrow
endothelium and transendothelial migration of leukemic cells. The
results obtained in vitro were supported by the immunophenotypic
characterization of marrow leukemic cells of 78 consecutive AML
patients on which we found that CD38 and CD31 expression levels
were positively correlated, and that an excess of CD31 (CD31/CD38
ratio >1) was associated with a higher peripheral WBC count.

Materials and Methods
Human cells and reagents. Marrow cells of 78 adult patients (Table 1)
presenting de novo AML were analyzed from samples collected after
obtaining informed consent from each patient and approval by the ethics
committee of the University Hospital of Tours. HL-60 and U937 (ECACC)
were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 20 AmoL/L L-glutamine supplemented
with 10% FCS, 100 units/mL penicillin G, and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin
(Invitrogen). The TrHBMEC cell line (10) was cultured in a-MEM with
ribonucleosides with 5% FCS, 100 units/mL penicillin G, 100 Ag/mL
streptomycin, and 0.25 Ag/mL amphotericin B (Bristol-Myers Squibb) in
gelatin-coated flasks.
Phenotype analysis by flow cytometry. The cells were incubated with
the following mAbs from BD Biosciences: APC-conjugated anti-CD45
immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1; HI30), PE-conjugated anti-CD34 IgG1 (8G12), PEconjugated anti-CXCR4 (12G5), FITC-conjugated anti-CD31 IgG1 (WM59),
FITC-conjugated anti-CD38 IgG1 (HIT2), PE-conjugated anti-CD44 IgG2b
(G44-26), FITC-conjugated anti-CD44 IgG1 (IM7), and FITC- or PEconjugated isotypic controls. CD168 (HMMR) expression was evaluated
using purified goat polyclonal antibody and goat IgG as negative control,
followed by FITC-rabbit anti-goat IgG (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Fluorescence resonance energy transfer and co-capping experiments. FRET experiments were carried out on a FACSCalibur flow
cytometer as previously described (11). Purified anti-CD38 mAb (T16,
Beckman Coulter) was conjugated with Cy3 dye using FluoroLink MAb Cy3
Labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). Leukemic cells were incubated at 4jC
for 1 h with the anti-CD38 Cy3-conjugated mAb alone or in combination
with FITC-conjugated anti-CD31 FITC- or anti-CD49d mAbs (WM59 and
HP2/1, respectively). For capping experiments, the cells were incubated with
the purified mouse anti-human CD31 mAb (CLB-HEC75) or CD49d (HP2/1)
for 30 min on ice, washed, and reacted with TRITC-labeled goat anti-mouse
Ig (GaM; Sigma) on ice. Samples were then moved to 37jC for 30 min to
induce capping, after which ice-cold PBS plus 0.5% bovine serum albumin
(BSA) containing 0.1% azide was added. The cells were maintained on ice
for counterstaining with biotinylated mAbs against CD38 (AT13/5, Serotec)
and further incubated with FITC-conjugated streptavidin (Sigma). Cells
settled on poly–L-lysine–coated coverslips (Sigma) were observed at room
temperature with a DMR microscope (Leica Microsystems).
Co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Cells were lysed in
10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mmol/L KCl, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.1 mmol/L
EGTA, and 10% [vol/vol] NP40 containing protease inhibitors. Western blot
analyses of CD38 CD44 and CD168 were done as described (12).
Immunoprecipitation was done with 2 Ag anti-CD31 goat polyclonal Ab
or goat IgG as negative control. Immune complexes were captured with
protein A/G PLUS-Agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and subjected to
SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-CD38 goat polyclonal Ab. All
antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The reactions
were developed with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the
ECL Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences).
Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA of HL-60 and
U-937 leukemic cell lines was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen). The relative
quantification of CD38, CD44, and HMMR gene expression was done by
real-time PCR on an ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System. cDNA

was generated using random primers and M-MLV RT (Invitrogen). Q-PCR
reactions were carried out in a total volume of 10 AL on 25 to 50 ng of cDNA
using TaqMan Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and Universal
ProbeLibrary assays designed with the ProbeFinder software (Roche
Applied Science). The primer sequences and Universal Probe numbers
used are available upon request. ABI Prism 7900HT SDS was programmed
to an initial step of 2 min at 50jC and 10 min at 95jC, followed by 50 cycles
of 15 s at 95jC and 1 min at 60jC. All reactions were run in triplicate, and
the average values were used for quantification. The human LOC100008588
(18S rRNA) predeveloped TaqMan assay (Applied Biosystems) was used as
the endogenous control to normalize the expression values of CD38, CD44,
and HMMR (DCT = Cttarget
Ctendogenous control). Relative fold differences
were determined using the DDCT method.
Hyaluronate adhesion assays. Culture dishes with grid (35 mm;
Sarstedt) were coated with hyaluronate (Sigma) at 10 Ag/mL in PBS
overnight at 4jC. The cells were incubated with anti-CD44 blocking mAb
(BU75, Ancell) or anti-CD38 blocking mAb (OKT10, Prof. F. Malavasi,
Laboratory of Immunogenetics, Turin, Italy) and plated into the dishes.
After incubation for 2 h at 37jC, adherent leukemic cells were counted in
10 separate microscope fields at 100 magnification (DMIL; Leica
Microsystems). Hyaluronate-specific adhesion was calculated as follows:
(number of cells adhering to hyaluronate-coated dish) (number of cells
adhering to PBS-coated dish).
Adhesion to TrHBMEC and transendothelial migration assays. The
experiments were done using anti-CD38 (OKT10) and anti-CD31 (CLBHEC75, Monosan) blocking mAbs. Before adhesion/migration assays,
leukemic cells were preincubated for 1 h at room temperature with
blocking mAbs. The percentage of adhesion/migration in the presence of
blocking mAbs was compared with the percentage obtained with the
isotypic control. Adhesion of HL-60 and U937 cells to the TrHBMEC cell line
was studied using a conventional adhesion assay using 51Cr-labeled cells
(13), where the cells were labeled with 51Cr2O4Na2 (100 ACi/5  106 cells;
Life Science Products) and were added to the endothelial cell monolayer.
For the transmigration experiments, TrHBMEC cells were seeded on 5-Am
microporous membranes (Transwell, Corning Incorporated) coated with
fibronectin (Sigma). Confluency was verified by light microscopy after
fixation in 100% methanol and May-Grünwald-Giemsa staining. Leukemic
cells were added to the upper chamber in 0.1 mL of assay medium, and
0.6 mL of assay medium with 200 ng/mL of stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1;
R&D Systems) was added to the lower compartment. The membrane
expression of CXCR4 on leukemic cells was checked by indirect
immunofluorescence staining using mouse anti-human CXCR4 IgG2a
(12G5, BD Biosciences). Transendothelial migration was allowed to proceed
at 37jC in 5% CO2 for 24 h. The migrated fraction was counted in the
bottom well of the migration chamber using a Malassez chamber. The cells
were then stained with FITC-conjugated anti-CD146 (S-Endo1, Biocytex)
and APC-conjugated anti-CD45 (HI30, BD Biosciences), and the percentages
of leukemic cells (CD146 CD45+) were determined.
Scanning electron microscopy. Adhering TrHBMEC cells were fixed
with a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde and 1% glutaraldehyde for at least
1 h at room temperature, and then preparations were stored at 4jC. The
preparations were postfixed for 30 min with 1% osmium tetroxide in
phosphate buffer. Preparations were dehydrated in progressive concentrations of ethanol (50–100%), dried by the critical point method (CO2), and
mounted on stubs. Then, a thin layer of platinum was deposited with a
Magnetron sputtering device. Preparations were studied under an FEG
Gemini 982 scanning electron microscope (Zeiss).
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were done with Statview
software, version 4.5 (Abacus Concept Inc.) using the Mann-Whitney
U test, Wilcoxon test, m2 contingency test, and z test for nonzero
correlation, as appropriate. The level of significance was set at 0.05.

Results
CD31 and CD38 are closely associated on myeloblastic
leukemic cells. We investigated a lateral association between
CD38 and its ligand CD31 on HL-60 and marrow AML cells using

fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), co-capping and coimmunoprecipitation strategies. FITC-conjugated anti-CD31 induced a 98.3 F 21.7% increase in geometric mean fluorescence
intensity (MFI) of Cy-3 on HL-60 cells. Conversely, the MFI of Cy3
was not clearly affected using FITC-conjugated anti-CD49d (+15.0
F 3.0%). The association being significant and specific, as shown
by the lack of energy transfer with anti-CD49d mAb, these results
suggest a physical association of CD31 and CD38 on leukemic cells
(Fig. 1A). Because a very stringent way of demonstrating protein
association in living cells is to impair the cell surface distribution of
one protein by capping it with a mAb and investigating whether a
second protein moves with it or co-caps, we conducted co-capping
experiments with HL-60 and marrow AML cells. Capping of CD31
was first induced with CLB-HEC75 in cell suspensions at 37jC. The
cells were then fixed and labeled with anti-CD38 mAbs. CD31 and
CD38 displayed very similar patterns of labeling following capping.
To determine the specificity of this assay, we induced capping of
CD49d with clone HP2/1 and investigated whether it also capped
CD38. As illustrated in Fig. 1B, CD38 was not co-capped with
CD49d, showing that the colocalization observed for CD31 and
CD38 was specific. Consistent with these findings, CD38 coimmunoprecipitated with CD31 in HL-60 cells, whereas no CD38
could be detected when immunoprecipitating with control goat
IgG (Fig. 1C).
CD38 promotes the adhesion of AML cells to hyaluronate.
Leukemic cells were treated with all–trans-retinoic acid (ATRA; or
left untreated) to induce CD38 overexpression and were then
plated onto a hyaluronate-coated dish. As verified by quantitative
reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), Western blot, and flow
cytometry, ATRA effectively induced overexpression of CD38 in

all experiments (Fig. 2A). Because CD44 and CD168 are also able to
interact with hyaluronate on leukemic cells (14, 15), we verified
that ATRA exposure did not increase their basal level of mRNA and
protein expression (Fig. 2A). Because CD44 can also promote
adhesion to hyaluronate, all in vitro adhesion assays were done
in the presence of anti-CD44 blocking mAb to minimize its role.
As expected, these antibodies inhibited the adhesion to hyaluronate in all experiments (data not shown). HL-60 and U937 cells
exposed to ATRA exhibited a 9.2 F 2.7- and 2.1 F 0.1-fold increase
in CD38 expression (S/N of MFI), and a 44.7 F 10.9% and 38.5 F
5.4% increase in adhesion to hyaluronate (n = 5, P < 0.001), respectively. Five experiments were also done with marrow leukemic cells
from AML patients with more than 80% marrow blastosis (Table 1).
The leukemic cells exposed to ATRA exhibited an average of 26.3 F
11.4% increase in CD38 expression (S/N of MFI) and 40.3 F 10.0%
increase in adhesion to hyaluronate (Fig. 2A). These results are
further supported by the fact that anti-CD38 (OKT10) and antiCD44 mAbs were found to inhibit, with the same order of
magnitude, the adhesion of untreated HL-60 cells to hyaluronate
(52.9% and 34.1%, respectively; data not shown). Together, these
results suggest that CD38 participates in the in vivo adhesion of
marrow AML cells to the extracellular matrix.
CD31 is more effective than CD38 in promoting adhesion of
leukemic cells to marrow endothelium. The roles of CD31 and
CD38 antigens in the adhesion of human leukemic cells to the
marrow endothelium were studied using anti-CD31 (CLB-HEC75)
and anti-CD38 (OKT10) blocking mAbs in assays with HL-60 and
U937 cells plated on the confluent monolayer of a human marrow
endothelial cell line (TrHBMEC). As presented in Fig. 2B, adhesion
of HL-60 and U937 cells at 4jC was inhibited by CLB-HEC75 (by

CD31/CD38 and Marrow Retention of Myeloid Leukemia

Figure 1. Membrane localization of CD31 and CD38 on
myeloblastic cells. A, FRET analysis of HL-60 cells stained
with Cy3-conjugated anti-CD38 mAb and FITC-conjugated
anti-CD31 mAb or anti-CD49d mAb as negative control.
FITC was excited at 488 nm, and Cy3 emissions were
collected at more than 600 nm. Each quadrant shows Cy3
emissions in the absence and presence of the indicated
FITC-conjugated mAb. A right shift indicates FRET.
B, co-immunoprecipitation assay. Top, cell lysate (500 Ag)
from HL-60 cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation
(IP ) with anti-CD31 goat polyclonal Ab or goat IgG. The
antibody-captured proteins were analyzed by Western
blotting with anti-CD38 antibody. C, co-capping experiment
with HL-60 cells and marrow AML blast cells. The cells
were capped with purified anti-CD31 mAb or anti-CD49d
mAb as control and TRITC-conjugated GaM for 30 min at
37jC. The experiment was blocked by the addition of cold
PBS, and counterstaining was done with biotin-conjugated
CD38 mAb and streptavidin-FITC. Cells were fixed and
analyzed with a Leica microscope using LUCIA software.
Original magnification, 400. The data are representative
of experiments done with HL-60 cells and AML marrow
leukemic cells.

62.5 F 3.2% and 42.7 F 8.4%, respectively) and OKT10 (35.2 F 4.1%
and 24.4 F 7.8%, respectively). CD38-mediated adhesion is known
to be weak and selectin-like. As expected, OKT10 did not affect
adhesion at 20jC (data not shown; ref. 16). Together with the
higher level of inhibition of adhesion to the endothelium observed
with CLB-HEC75, this suggests that CD31 is more effective than
CD38 in mediating interactions between leukemic cells and bone
marrow endothelial cells. These results are supported by similar
assays done with HL-60 and U937 cells previously exposed to
ATRA, in which the increase in CD38 expression (Fig. 2A) did
not change the effects of OKT10 (36.1 F 2.3% and 16.1 F 5.9%
inhibition of adhesion after ATRA exposure, respectively). As
shown by flow cytometry analysis, ATRA weakly modified the
expression of CD31 on these cells (Fig. 2B, right). Because the ATRA
exposure induced a high increase in CD38 expression, the lower
effect of CLB-HEC75 on adhesion to TrHBMEC (50.1 F 2.4% and
67.1 F 7.4% after ATRA exposure, respectively) could be due to a
lower quantity of non-colocalized CD31 antigens.
CD31 is more effective than CD38 in promoting transendothelial migration of leukemic cells through marrow
endothelium. To further investigate the roles of CD31 and CD38
antigens in the transendothelial migration of leukemic cells, we
used blocking mAbs in a Transwell system, where SDF-1 was used
as a chemoattractant for CXCR4+ leukemic cells (Fig. 3A).
TrHBMEC cells were cultured until confluency on the 5-Am
microporous membrane (Fig. 3B). Confluency of the endothelial
cells was checked by microscopy analysis after May-GrünwaldGiemsa staining (Fig. 3C). The CXCR4 expression was not different
from the previously reported French-American-British (FAB)
subgroups (17). The ability of CXCR4+ leukemic cells to migrate

www.aacrjournals.org

in response to SDF-1 was also verified after staining with PKH26
fluorescent dye (Fig. 3A). The levels of transendothelial migration
displayed by HL-60 cells and leukemic cells of AML patients were
3.5 F 0.4% and 10.2 F 3.9%, respectively (data not shown). As
presented in Fig. 4A, anti-CD31 mAb blocked transmigration of
HL-60 cells across the TrHBMEC monolayer by 49.7 F 6.3%, and
inhibition was lower (29.2 F 4.1%) using anti-CD38 mAb (n = 5;
P < 0.0001). The difference was not due to selective transmigration
of smaller cells because their forward scatter was not different.7
Moreover, we verified the absence of CD45 CD146+ cells in the
lower chamber of the Transwell system in all experiments (data not
shown). Transendothelial migration experiments were also done
using marrow leukemic cells of seven AML patients, and the effects
of blocking mAb were analyzed in terms of antigen density on the
cell surface (Fig. 4B). In all cases, CXCR4 was expressed on these
cells (data not shown). The inhibition of migration by anti-CD31
blocking mAb ranged from 2.3% to 66.3% of controls and was
correlated with CD31 expression level (R = 0.9236; P < 0.0001) as
shown in Fig. 4C, indicating that migration blocking was stronger
when the expression of CD31 on AML leukemic cells was higher. In
contrast, migration in the presence of anti-CD38 blocking mAb was
about 80% that of the control level (range from 70.6% to 89.6%)
without correlation with CD38 expression level (Fig. 4C), suggesting
a minor role in the transendothelial migration process.

malignant cell dissemination in vivo, we studied the phenotypes of
marrow leukemic cells and the peripheral WBC counts of 78
consecutive adult patients with newly diagnosed de novo AML.
Patient characteristics, peripheral WBC counts, and the expression
of CD31 and CD38 antigens for each FAB subtype are presented in
Table 1. Expression levels of CD38 and CXCR4 were not different in
terms of FAB subtypes, whereas CD31 expression was higher on the
M4/M5 FAB subtypes (P < 0.0001). The peripheral WBC count was
statistically influenced by the CD31/CD38 ratio. As presented in
Fig. 5A, an excess of CD31 antigen was associated with an
increased WBC count in peripheral blood when comparing patients
with ratio >1 to those with ratio <1 (P < 0.0001). Interestingly,
peripheral WBC count was correlated with the CD31/CD38 ratio
(R = 0.5286; P = 0.0129), whereas such a correlation was not found
when considering CD38 or CD31 expression on marrow leukemic
cells separately. In comparison with the group of patients with
ratio <1, the group with ratio >1 was characterized by higher
expression of CD31 (S/N MFI = 7.9 F 1.4 versus 4.0 F 0.5, P =
0.0081) and lower expression of CD38 (S/N MFI = 5.0 F 0.7 versus
8.6 F 1.1, P = 0.0058). Moreover, although the CD31/CD38 ratio was
higher in AML (myelo)monocytic subtypes when comparing FAB
M4/M5 to FAB M0/M1/M2/M3 subtypes (1.21 F 0.08 and 0.72 F

0.08, respectively; P < 0.0001), the median peripheral WBC count in
the subgroup of patients with a CD31/CD38 ratio >1 was higher
when considering each FAB subtype separately (Fig. 5B). These
findings are in accordance with the results of the in vitro functional
analyses and are supported by a correlation between the expression
levels of membrane CD31 and CD38 on marrow leukemic cells (R =
0.6621; P < 0.0001). Thus, as shown in Fig. 5C, marrow leukemic
cells expressed CD38 and CD31 simultaneously, suggesting a
heterotypic model of CD38/CD31 interaction in accordance with
the colocalization of these two antigens shown in vitro.

Discussion
In this study, we focused on the role of CD31 and CD38 cell
surface antigens in controlling this process via the CD38/
extracellular matrix and CD31/marrow endothelial cell interactions.
CD38 has been mostly studied in immune cells (reviewed in ref.
18), on which CD38 ligation delivers activation/antiapoptotic
signals and induces cytokine production. Many groups have shown
that its short cytoplasmic tail is not required for CD38-mediated
signal transduction. CD38 is localized on lipid microdomains (rafts)
within the plasma membrane (19), and its intrinsic ineptitude to

described in Table 1. The effects of ATRA on the
expression of CD38, CD44, and CD168 in HL-60
and U937 cells were evaluated by quantitative PCR,
Western blot, and flow cytometry. In quantitative
PCR experiments (lower right ), mRNA levels were
determined by calculating the DCT values where the
levels of mRNA for CD38, CD44 (all isoforms), and
HMMR (CD168 ) are normalized according to the
endogenous control gene LOC100008588 (18S

(DCt) and the relative fold difference after ATRA

50 Ag lysate protein, which were analyzed with antiCD38, anti-CD44, and anti-CD168 antibodies and
reprobed with a-tubulin (lower line ) to verify equal
loading. The flow-cytometric expression of CD38,

transduce signals is overcome by working in physical and functional
association with specialized signaling molecules such as TCR/CD3,
BCR, and CD16 on the cell surface of lymphocytes (20–22) and with
CD83, CD11b, and CCR7 on mature monocyte-derived dendritic
cells (23). The ability of CD38 to contribute to molecular complexes
on the cell surface of myeloid leukemic cells has not been reported
to date. CD31 is a ligand of CD38 (7), and we showed here using
FRET and co-capping experiments that CD31 and CD38 are closely
associated on AML cells. Interestingly, this colocalization was not
been found on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells (24). The
fact that it is known that CD38 and CD31 are polymorphic in the
white cell population may explain this difference (25, 26). Moreover,
the specific CD38 molecular complex on these lymphoid cells could
physically hamper their lateral association with CD31 on the cell
surface. Our experimental results are supported by a correlation
between CD38 and CD31 expression on marrow leukemic cells from
this cohort of 78 de novo AML patients. This simultaneous
expression has also been reported on CLL B cells and marrow
neoplastic plasma cells (27–29). The small number of CD31 or CD38
molecules not engaged in the CD31/CD38 membrane complex on
leukemic cells could therefore interact more easily with the
microenvironment and promote either extracellular matrix anchorage or transendothelial migration.

www.aacrjournals.org

Hyaluronate is a key component of the extracellular matrix and
is abundant at the periphery of the marrow microvasculature (30),
whose basal membrane specifically presents a huge quantity of
CSPG (2) known to complex with hyaluronate (9). Nishina et al. (6)
reported two hyaluronate-binding sites in the extracellular domain
of CD38. We verified the functionality of these [B(X7)B] motifs by
demonstrating that the ATRA-induced up-regulation in CD38
expression concomitantly increased cell adhesion to hyaluronate.
A high number of CD38 molecules on the cells may therefore
promote mechanical cell anchorage to the extracellular matrix
in vivo. In certain cases, hyaluronate binding can modify the AML
cell biology, such as the CD44/hyaluronate interaction known to
induce differentiation (31). In contrast to CD44, the cytoplasmic
tail of CD38 is very short and probably unable to transduce signals
after hyaluronate binding. In accordance with this hypothesis,
Todisco et al. (32) reported that hyaluronate is not able to induce
the marked inhibition of the leukemic myelopoiesis observed after
CD38 ligation by anti-CD38 mAb in the presence of stromal feeder
layers mimicking the in vivo marrow microenvironment.
CD31 plays a role in transendothelial migration of various CD31+
cell types such as CD34+ hematopoietic cells (33, 34), lymphocytes
(7, 16), and monocytes (4). Because CD31 is distributed over the
entire endothelial cell surface (8), it could interact with CD38 or

CD31 expressed on marrow AML cells. We developed a model of
leukemic cell trafficking using the TrHBMEC cell line that
expresses CD31 and retains the morphology, phenotype, and
function of primary marrow endothelial cells (10). By analogy to
studies on mature lymphocytes, CD38 and CD31 expressed on AML
leukemic cells (17) could be important for the adhesion of leukemic
cells to marrow microvascular endothelial cells and for the
transendothelial migration process (7, 16). The role of the CD38/
CD31 interaction has been clearly shown for lymphocytes in the
adhesion to endothelium process (7), and a similar role for AML
cells has recently been suggested (35). Nevertheless, the CD38/
CD31 interaction is selectin-like, weaker than that of CD31/CD31
(16). In accordance with this, our results show that anti-CD38
blocking mAb induces a decrease in adhesion of leukemic cells
to the endothelium only in experiments done at 4jC to minimize
integrin-mediated binding (16). Moreover, the strong up-regulation
of CD38 after ATRA exposure does not affect the effects of antiCD38 blocking mAb used at saturating concentrations. The low
levels of migration displayed by leukemic cells in the transendothelial migration experiments are in agreement with the
findings of other groups who also used marrow endothelial cells
(33, 34, 36). The results indicated a major role of the CD31/CD31
interaction and a minor role of the CD38/CD31 interaction in
promoting leukemic cell transmigration. In contrast to anti-CD38

blocking mAb, which induces a slight and invariable inhibition of
migration, anti-CD31 mAb reduces this process all the more
strongly when the antigen is highly expressed on AML cells.
All these elements support the concept that the densities of
CD31 and CD38 antigens on the cell surface of leukemic cells are
critical to promoting either their marrow retention via the CD38/
hyaluronate interaction or their extramedullary dissemination via
the CD31/CD31(endothelial cell) interaction. Evaluation of peripheral leukocytosis and the densities of these two antigens on the
marrow leukemic cells of 78 de novo AML patients supports this
concept. In accordance with the results reported by Brouwer et al.
(17), the expression of CD31 was higher in the M4/M5 FAB
subgroup, and peripheral WBC counts showed no correlation with
the levels of expression of this antigen. However, when considering
the concomitant expression of CD31 and CD38 using the CD31/
CD38 ratio, we show that an excess of CD31 (ratio > 1) is associated
with a higher peripheral WBC count. Hyaluronate is abundant in
lymph nodes (14), which participate in its catabolism (reviewed in
ref. 37). Interestingly Jaksic et al. (27) applied the concept of the
CD31/CD38 ratio to study the distribution of CLL B cells. They
reported that a higher CD38 expression was associated with
lymphoid compartments, particularly lymph nodes, and that these
results suggested a functional interaction between CD38 and
hyaluronate.

between the CD31/CD38 ratio (S/N of MFI) and peripheral WBC count without discrimination of FAB subtypes (A) and in each FAB subtype (B ). The results are
represented using box plots in which the bottom of each box is the 25th percentile and the top is the 75th percentile. Medians are drawn inside the boxes. The lower and
upper adjacents show the 10th and 90th percentiles, respectively. o, patients below the 10th and above the 90th percentiles. C, correlation between CD31 and
CD38 expression on marrow leukemic cells of AML patients. Data are expressed as S/N of MFIs obtained by flow cytometry. D, schematic diagrams of a proposed
model to explain the concomitant roles of CD31 and CD38 in the marrow retention of AML leukemic cells. CD31 and CD38 are closely associated on the cell
surface. An excess of CD31 promotes their egress to the circulation through homophilic CD31 interaction with marrow endothelial cells. Conversely, an excess of
CD38 promotes cell attachment to hyaluronate, whereas the interaction between CD38 and CD31 on marrow endothelial cells is too weak to counteract matrix
anchorage, resulting in weaker egress of leukemic cells to the peripheral blood.

CD38 and CD31 could interact with other structures found in the
marrow microenvironment and possibly involved in the cell
migration process. CD31 is able to recognize avh3 integrin on
the endothelial cell surface, but these molecules interact on the
same cell surface in a cis manner (38) and do not act as counterreceptors in mediating leukocyte transmigration (39). Moreover, it
has been reported that CD38 and cADPR are required for
chemotaxis of human monocytes and dendritic cells in response
to SDF-1, the ligand of CXCR4 (40, 41). Because the SDF-1/CXCR4
axis plays a key role in the control of leukemic cell dissemination
(42–45), these elements suggest that a functional interaction
between CD38 and CXCR4 might contribute to leukemic cell
anchorage in the marrow microenvironment.
In conclusion, the results presented here lead us to propose a
model in which CD31 and CD38 are closely associated on AML
cells and where excess of CD31 promotes egress of the cells from
the marrow compartment, whereas an excess of CD38 enhances
their anchorage to the marrow microenvironment (Fig. 5D). Most
investigators are aware that cell-microenvironment interactions
within various niches (stromal/osteoblastic or sinusoidal endothe-

lial cell niches) have a role in leukemia stem cell survival and drug
resistance (1, 46, 47). In this sense, recent therapeutic strategies
(CXCR4 antagonists) propose to release AML cells from their
adhesive sites to render them more chemosensitive (48). To this
end, our results predict the potential benefits of new therapeutic
approaches targeted at CD38 and CD31 to prevent the acquisition
of a chemoresistant phenotype.
