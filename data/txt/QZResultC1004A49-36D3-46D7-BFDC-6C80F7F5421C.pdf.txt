Abstract
Resistance to available hormone therapies in prostate cancer
has been associated with alternative splicing of androgen receptor
(AR) and speciﬁcally, the expression of truncated and constitutively active AR variant 7 (AR-V7). The transcriptional activity of
steroid receptors, including AR, is dependent on interactions with
the HSP90 chaperone machinery, but it is unclear whether HSP90
modulates the activity or expression of AR variants. Here, we
investigated the effects of HSP90 inhibition on AR-V7 in prostate
cancer cell lines endogenously expressing this variant. We demonstrate that AR-V7 and full-length AR (AR-FL) were depleted
upon inhibition of HSP90. However, the mechanisms underlying
AR-V7 depletion differed from those for AR-FL. Whereas HSP90
inhibition destabilized AR-FL and induced its proteasomal deg-

radation, AR-V7 protein exhibited higher stability than AR-FL and
did not require HSP90 chaperone activity. Instead, HSP90 inhibition resulted in the reduction of AR-V7 mRNA levels but did not
affect total AR transcript levels, indicating that HSP90 inhibition
disrupted AR-V7 splicing. Bioinformatic analyses of transcriptome-wide RNA sequencing data conﬁrmed that the secondgeneration HSP90 inhibitor onalespib altered the splicing of at
least 557 genes in prostate cancer cells, including AR. These
ﬁndings indicate that the effects of HSP90 inhibition on mRNA
splicing may prove beneﬁcial in prostate cancers expressing ARV7, supporting further clinical investigation of HSP90 inhibitors
in malignancies no longer responsive to androgen deprivation.

Introduction

androgen/androgen receptor (AR) axis that promote continued
AR transcriptional activity. Novel androgen biosynthesis inhibitors (e.g., abiraterone acetate) and AR antagonists (e.g., enzalutamide) overcome several of the mechanisms underlying persistent AR transcriptional activity and have been shown to extend
overall survival of patients with CRPC (2, 3).
AR belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors, whose members are ligand-responsive transcription factors. The AR gene is located on Xq11-12; it
contains eight exons that encode a protein of 919 amino
acids (AR-FL). It is composed of four functional domains: the
amino-terminal transcription activation domain (NTD),
which possesses a ligand-independent transcriptional function (AF-1); the DNA-binding domain (DBD), which binds to
speciﬁc DNA sequences named androgen-responsive elements
(ARE); the hinge region, which includes a part of the nuclear
localization signal; and the carboxy-terminal ligand-binding
domain (LBD), which has a ligand-dependent transcriptional
activity (AF-2). Multiple alternatively spliced AR variants (ARV) have been identiﬁed and translated from alternatively
spliced AR mRNAs (4). These variants typically contain exons
1–3, but lack portions of the carboxy-terminal LBD, and may
be constitutively active (5, 6). AR-Vs have been shown to
drive androgen-independent cell proliferation in a manner
that is resistant to antiandrogens, including enzalutamide (7).
The expression of AR-Vs is higher in CRPC compared with
primary hormone–na€ve prostate cancer and is reported to be

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and a
leading cause of male cancer mortality in Western societies (1).
Androgen deprivation remains the mainstay of treatment for
patients with advanced stage disease. However, the response to
suppression of gonadal androgens is not durable, and the transition of metastatic disease to a lethal castration-resistant prostate
cancer (CRPC) is inevitable. It is now widely recognized that
CRPC progression results from many different alterations of the

mostly lacking in normal prostate epithelium (5, 6, 8–11).
Constitutively active AR-Vs have been implicated as a mechanism of resistance to current hormonal therapies targeting
the LBD (7, 12–15).
One of the best characterized variants, and the most frequently detected in CRPC to date (11), is the AR-V7 (also
termed AR3), which contains exons 1–3 and 16 unique amino
acids that arise from cryptic exon 3 (6). AR-V7 localizes constitutively to the nucleus and facilitates AR-FL nuclear localization in the absence of androgen (14). AR-V7 upregulation
mitigates the ability of the AR antagonist enzalutamide to
inhibit AR-FL nuclear trafﬁcking (14). AR-V7 may also direct
a distinct transcriptional program to AR-FL, including the
transcription of several cell cycle–related genes in addition to
canonical androgen-responsive genes (11, 16). Recent clinical
studies have linked AR-V7 expression in circulating tumor cells
(CTC) and CRPC tissue with resistance to enzalutamide and
abiraterone (17, 18). This highlights an urgent need for alternative treatment strategies targeting AR-Vs.
HSP90 is a molecular chaperone essential for the late stage
maturation, stability, and function of a large number of client
proteins involved in key signal transduction pathways in prostate cancer, including AR, AKT, and the glucocorticoid receptor
[GR (NR3C1) approved name; refs. 19–21]. A key requirement
for the transcriptional activity of steroid receptors is the interaction of unbound receptor with the HSP90 chaperone machinery. This interaction occurs exclusively through the LBD via
direct binding to HSP40 and HSP70 (22, 23). In prostate cancer
cells, inhibition of HSP90 chaperone activity impairs the nuclear translocation of AR-FL and enhances the degradation of ARFL protein, resulting in decreased AR-FL transcriptional output
(20, 24, 25) and prostate cancer cell proliferation (26, 27).
Conversely, recent studies have suggested that AR-V7 nuclear
translocation and transcriptional activity does not require
HSP90 activity (28, 29), although HSP90 has been proposed
as a therapeutic target in CRPC.
Several HSP90 inhibitors are undergoing clinical trial (29, 30).
In this study, we investigated the effect of HSP90 inhibition in
prostate cancer cells expressing AR-V7. We demonstrate that
HSP90 inhibition reduces expression of AR-V7. Interestingly, we
show that AR-V7 downregulation is not due to a traditional
client–chaperone mechanism but results from disruption of AR
splicing following HSP90 inhibition.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and drug treatment
22Rv1 (#CRL-2505), VCaP (#CRL-2876), and PC3 (#CRL1345) cells were obtained from the ATCC and grown in their
recommended culture medium, containing 10% FBS at 37 C in
an atmosphere of 5% CO2. LNCaP95, an androgen-independent cell line derived from long-term continuous culture of
LNCaP cells, were cultured in red-phenol free RPMI1640

Cell growth inhibition
Cell growth inhibition was assessed using the sulforhodamine
B assay (32). The GI50 was calculated as the drug concentration
that inhibits cell growth by 50% compared with control growth
using GraphPad Prism software.
Cell-cycle analysis
Cell cycle distribution and sub-G1 populations were analyzed
by ﬂow cytometry using propidium iodide staining (33). Data
were analyzed with the FlowJo Software.
Cell lysis and Western blot analysis
Whole cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Pierce) supplemented
with protease inhibitor cocktail (cOmplete, Roche). The nuclear
and cytosolic subcellular fractions were prepared using the NEPER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Kit (Pierce) according to
the manufacturer's instructions. To obtain detergent-soluble and
detergent-insoluble fractions, cells were lysed in TNESV buffer
(1% NP40 detergent, 0.5% deoxycholate, 50 mmol/L Tris-Cl (pH
7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5 mmol/L EDTA) for 20 minutes on ice.
The NP40 detergent–insoluble pellet fraction was resuspended in
RIPA lysis buffer with protease inhibitors by brief sonication.
Protein extracts (20 mg) were separated on 4% to 12% NuPAGE
Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) by electrophoresis and subsequently
electrotransferred onto Immobilon-PPVDF Membranes of 0.45mm pore size (Millipore). Details of primary antibodies used are
provided in Supplementary Table S1. Chemiluminescence was
detected on Amersham Hyperﬁlm ECL (GE Healthcare Life
Sciences). In some experiments, the FluorChem Q Imager and
Software was used for annotation and analysis of images, including densitometry.
Reverse transcription and qRT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cells using the RNeasy Plus Mini
Kit (Qiagen) and from formalin-ﬁxed and parafﬁn-embedded
(FFPE) tissue using the RNeasy FFPE Kit (Qiagen) as per manufacturer's instructions. RNA (5 mL) was reverse transcribed into
cDNA using the First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche). qRTPCR was carried out on ViiA 7 System Real-Time PCR System (Life
Technologies) using the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems). The assays used in this study are listed in
Supplementary Table S2. Fold change in mRNA expression levels
was calculated by the comparative Ct method, using the formula
2DDCt and human RPLPO (large ribosomal protein) as calibrator.
The vehicle-treated sample was set to 1.
Coimmunoprecipitation
Whole-cell lysates were obtained using Pierce IP Lysis Buffer
(Thermo Scientiﬁc). Protein extracts (approximately 1 mg of total
protein) were precleaned by protein A/G PLUS-Agarose (Millipore), and extracts were incubated with the respective antibodies
(1 mg) overnight at 4 C. Immune complexes were collected by
protein A/G PLUS-Agarose beads, analyzed by immunoblotting,
probed with the protein A/G HRP-conjugated secondary antibody
(Thermo Scientiﬁc), and visualized using an ECL chemiluminescence (Thermo Scientiﬁc).
Transfection
PC3 cells (3  105) were plated on 6-well plates and reverse
transfected using the X-tremeGENE HP DNA Transfection Reagent

(3 ml/well; Roche; ref. 34). The plasmid constructs (1 mg DNA/
well) used were pcDNA3.1-AR-V7 (encoding the V7-truncated
AR isoform, a gift from Dr. Jun Luo, Johns Hopkins University,
Baltimore, MD) and F527-AR (encoding the full-length AR;
ref. 34).
Tumor xenograft studies
Subcutaneous 22Rv1 solid tumor xenografts were prepared by
serial passaging in male NMRI nu/nu mice (Harlan). Tumors were
measured twice weekly with microcalipers and tumor volumes
determined using the formula: (length  breadth2  0.5). Drug
treatment was started when tumors were well established
(mean tumor volume, 120 mm3). Onalespib was dissolved in
17.5% (w/v) hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin and administered
intraperitoneally at 70 mg/kg twice a week for 2 weeks or 80
mg/kg once weekly (35). For pharmacodynamic analyses, tumorbearing animals were sacriﬁced at indicated time points after a
single dose of onalespib at 80 mg/kg (typically 4/time point).
IHC
IHC for AR N-terminus domain (AR-NTD), HSP72, Ki67, and
cleaved caspase-3 was performed on 4-mm FFPE tumor sections.
Details of the IHC assays are provided in Supplementary Table S3.
Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin (TCS Biosciences
Ltd), dehydrated, and mounted with DPX mountant (Sigma). All
sections were scored by a pathologist blinded to treatment
information.
RNA sequencing
Total cellular RNA was extracted and puriﬁed using the RNeasy
Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA integrity was determined by Bioanalyzer
2100 (Agilent Technologies), and only samples with RNA integrity numbers 9.5 were used. RNA (500 ng) was prepared into a
library using the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina) and
then clustered and sequenced on a Hi-Seq 2000 (Illumina) using
TruSeq v3. An average of around 40 million paired end reads were
sequenced per sample. The experiment was repeated three times.
The paired end raw reads in FASTQ format were aligned to the
reference human genome (hg19) using TopHat v2.0.7. The library
and mapping quality were estimated using Picard tools (http://
broadinstitute.github.io/picard). The alternative splicing events
(SE, RI, MXE, A5SS, and A3SS), based on Ensembl v61 annotation, were accessed using MATS v3.0.8 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/pmc/articles/PMC3333886/).
Statistical analyses
Effects of different treatments were compared using the Student
t test, Mann–Whitney test, or ANOVA. Survival analysis was
performed by Kaplan–Meier methods and log-rank analysis using
quadruplication of the tumor as surrogate endpoint. In the RNA
sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis, the supportive reads of each
alternative splicing event were counted, with the inclusion level
being estimated using a Bayesian model as described by Shen and
colleagues, 2012 (36). Pairwise comparisons of each splicing
event were performed among treatments using the Markov chain
Monte Carlo method coupled with a simulation-based adaptive
sampling procedure to calculate the P value (36). Sample replicates were used to control variability within-treatment groups.
The FDR was obtained by the Benjamini–Hochberg method with
an FDR < 0.05 being employed for the differential alternative
splicing signiﬁcance assessment.

Results
HSP90 targeting inhibits proliferation of prostate
cancer cells expressing AR-V7
We initially examined the effects of the ﬁrst-generation HSP90
inhibitors tanespimycin (17-AAG) and alvespimycin (17-DMAG)
and the second-generation HSP90 inhibitor onalespib (AT13387)
on cell proliferation in human prostate cancer cell lines expressing
the AR-V7, including 22Rv1, VCaP, and LNCaP95. Previous
studies had established the expression status for both AR-FL and
AR-Vs in these cell lines (5, 6, 28). HSP90 inhibition reduced cell
proliferation in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown).
Onalespib and alvespimycin potently inhibited the growth of
the androgen-dependent cell line VCaP and also the growth of the
androgen-independent 22Rv1 and LNCaP95 cell lines, which are
resistant to the AR antagonist enzalutamide (Table 1; refs. 7, 11).
Our results conﬁrmed previous observations that AR-V7 expression does not confer resistance to HSP90 inhibitors in prostate
cancer cells (29).
HSP90 targeting depletes AR-FL and AR-V7 in prostate cancer
cell lines
We then investigated the effect of HSP90 inhibition on AR-FL
and AR-V7 protein levels in prostate cancer cells expressing both
the AR-FL and AR-V7. Onalespib reduced AR-FL protein irrespective of AR-FL status (i.e., wild type or mutant) in a concentrationand time-dependent fashion in VCaP and 22Rv1 cell lines (Fig. 1).
Notably, onalespib caused similar depletion of AR-V7 protein
in the 3 cell lines tested (Fig. 1). AR-FL and AR-V7 depletion
was accompanied by a concentration-dependent (data not shown)
and time-dependent depletion of various HSP90 clients, including
AKT, ERBB2, CRAF (RAF1), and GR (Supplementary Fig. S1).
HSP72 (HSPA1) and HSP27 (HSPB1) were induced by HSP90
inhibition, associated with the heat shock factor1 (HSF1)–mediated stress response, conﬁrming HSP90 target engagement (37).
Similar results were observed with ﬁrst-generation HSP90 inhibitors (geldanamycin, tanespimycin, and alvespimycin); however,
tanespimycin resulted only in modest depletion of AR-FL and
AR-V7 at the concentrations used in VCaP and 22Rv1 cells (Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3). As DT-diaphorase/NQO1 plays a role
in primary and acquired resistance to tanespimycin (32, 38), we
evaluated constitutive protein expression levels in prostate cancer
cell lines to clarify whether lower sensitivity to tanespimycin was
due to different expression of the enzyme. Low levels of DTdiaphorase/NQO1 protein were detected in 22Rv1 and VCaP cells,
respectively, by immunoblotting, possibly explaining the differences in effect seen with tanespimycin compared with alvespimycin and onalespib (data not shown). We should note that all the
HSP90 inhibitors we had tested inhibit both a and b HSP90
isoforms. We conﬁrmed depletion of AR-V7 protein when the
expression of both the HSP90 isoforms was reduced simultaneously by siRNA knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S4).

Importantly, in time-course experiments, the kinetics of
AR-V7 protein loss in response to HSP90 inhibition differed
from that for AR-FL (Fig. 1C and D). Onalespib induced a
reduction of AR-FL protein within 4 hours. In VCaP cells, ARFL was reduced in a time-dependent fashion, with maximal
depletion reached at 48 to 72 hours, but in LNCaP95 AR-FL,
protein level remained constant. Depletion of AR-V7 was ﬁrst

noted after 12 to 24 hours, reaching maximal depletion at
48 to 72 hours when AR-V7 was hardly detectable. The
timing and degree of AR-V7 depletion was similar in VCaP
and LNCaP95. These results conﬁrmed AR-FL depletion following HSP90 inhibition and also indicated for the ﬁrst time
that AR-V7 protein level is also decreased when HSP90 is
inhibited.

induced accumulation of high-molecular weight ubiquitinated
AR-FL forms that were redistributed to the detergent-insoluble
fraction (Fig. 2A). Such accumulation of high-molecular weight
AR-V7 forms was not observed, suggesting the lack of involvement of the proteasomal pathway in AR-V7 depletion by
onalespib (Fig. 2A).
To determine whether the observed decrease in AR-V7 protein in onalespib-treated cells was the result of altered protein
stability, we treated VCaP with the protein synthesis inhibitor
cycloheximide in the presence or absence of onalespib (Fig. 2B
and C). When protein synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide, AR-V7 stability was greater than AR-FL (Fig. 2B), suggesting that AR-V7 has a longer half-life than AR-FL. Onalespib

AR-V7 protein is more stable than AR-FL and is not directly
affected by HSP90 inhibition
HSP90 inhibition results in protein client destabilization
and degradation by the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway (39).
Ubiquitinated proteins ﬁrst accumulate in the cytosol and
become aggregated and relocated in the detergent-insoluble
fraction of cells when proteasomes are inhibited. To evaluate
whether AR-V7 protein depletion was due to increased proteasomal degradation after HSP90 blockade, we examined the
impact of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 on AR-V7 depletion
by onalespib. VCaP cells were treated with onalespib in the
presence or absence of proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 24
hours. As expected, addition of MG132 to onalespib treatment

HSP90 inhibition decreases AR-V7 expression

treatment signiﬁcantly reduced AR-FL protein levels, indicating
increased degradation of AR-FL (Fig. 2B and C, top). Conversely, AR-V7 protein stability was not affected as demonstrated by
similar levels of AR-V7 in the presence of onalespib (Fig. 2B and
C, bottom). To further conﬁrm that the effect of onalespib was
not due to protein destabilization and increased protein degradation, we also investigated the effects of onalespib in the ARnegative PC3 cell line transiently transfected with plasmid
constructs carrying AR-FL and AR-V7 cDNA. Onalespib treatment in this transient transfection system resulted in the
depletion of transiently expressed AR-FL, but not AR-V7 protein, conﬁrming that the effect of HSP90 inhibition on AR-V7
was not due to destabilization or a direct effect on AR-V7
protein (Supplementary Fig. S5).
AR-V7 bypasses direct HSP90 binding
A key requirement for steroid receptor activity is the interaction of unliganded receptors with the HSP90 chaperone
machinery (40). To further examine the relationship between
AR-V7 and HSP90, we determined by coimmunoprecipitation
assays whether AR-V7 and HSP90 protein complexes exist
in prostate cancer cells that endogenously express the variant
(Fig. 2D). As expected, AR-FL formed a complex with HSP90
when the cells were cultured in androgen-depleted media
(Fig. 2D, top). In contrast, AR-V7 did not coimmunoprecipitate
detectable amounts of HSP90 (Fig. 2D, bottom). This was in
agreement with results of Gills and colleagues in PC3 cells
exogenously expressing the AR-V7 (29). Also, in keeping with a
previous report (7), using subcellular fractionation we conﬁrmed that AR-V7 entered the nucleus independently of HSP90
activity (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicated that AR-V7 protein, unlike AR-FL, does not require the
HSP90 chaperone.
HSP90 inhibition induces AR-V7 mRNA downregulation
To evaluate whether AR-V7 depletion was due to the downregulation of AR mRNA expression, we next examined the levels of
AR transcripts following onalespib treatment (Fig. 3A). In VCaP,
22Rv1, and LNCaP95 cells treated for 24 hours with onalespib,
AR-FL mRNA levels were not signiﬁcantly altered (data not
shown). AR-V7 mRNA levels, however, were signiﬁcantly
decreased by onalespib in a concentration-dependent fashion
(Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S6). Onalespib treatment at
0.6 mmol/L for 48 hours decreased AR-V7 mRNA level by 72 %
(Fig. 3A). To distinguish between transcriptional and posttranscriptional effects on AR-V7 mRNA, we examined the effect of
onalespib treatment on mRNA stability. VCaP cells were treated
with onalespib or vehicle in combination with the transcriptional
inhibitor actinomycin D (ACTD). Onalespib treatment did not
signiﬁcantly alter the AR-V7 (Fig. 3B) and AR-FL (data not shown)

mRNA levels in the presence of ACTD, suggesting that the decrease
in AR-V7 mRNA in onalespib-treated cells was not due to reduced
stability of the mRNA. These results, coupled with the lack of
depletion of AR-FL mRNA, suggested that onalespib reduced the
generation of AR-V7 mRNA. To test this, we evaluated levels of
unspliced AR pre-mRNA in 22Rv1 cells using three different sets of
primers/probes (AR-5, AR-6, and AR-7; Supplementary Table S2)
directed against different regions of the unspliced AR cDNA
(intron 8–exon 9, intron 3, and exon 2–intron 2). Onalespib did
not reduce levels of unspliced AR and AR-FL but only AR-V7
mRNA levels (Fig. 3C), suggesting that HSP90 inhibition specifically altered pre-mRNA splicing and impaired the generation of
AR-V7 mRNA.
HSP90 inhibition disrupts alternative splicing in prostate
cancer cells
HSP90 inhibition elicits a dual effect in cells: the depletion of
client proteins and the activation of a heat shock response
(HSR) mediated by HSF1 activation (41). It has been reported
that the splicing of mRNA precursors is broadly repressed on
heat shock (42–44). To evaluate global changes in splicing
pattern associated with HSP90 inhibition, we treated VCaP cells
with onalespib (0.3 and 0.6 mmol/L) for 24 hours and performed RNA-Seq analysis. The two different concentrations of
onalespib (0.3 and 0.6 mmol/L) resulted in largely overlapping
splicing changes (Supplementary Table S4; Fig. 4A). Onalespib
treatment introduced 743 alternative splicing events involving
557 genes (FDR < 0.05; Supplementary Table S4). In keeping
with data following heat shock, we observed a signiﬁcant
increase in the retention of introns in transcripts and decreased
exon skipping (Fig. 4C; refs. 42, 43). Furthermore, RNA-Seq
analyses conﬁrmed a reduction of AR-V7 cryptic exon expression (Fig. 4B). Pathway analyses showed that genes involved in
splicing, including processing of capped intron–containing premRNA(R) and spliceosome(K), as well as heatshock-related
pathways, were signiﬁcantly enriched (FDR < 0.05) in the
alternative splicing events induced by HSP90 inhibition (Supplementary Table S5).
Onalespib exhibits antitumor activity against
AR-V7–expressing 22Rv1 tumor xenografts
We next evaluated the effect of onalespib on tumor growth and
AR-V7 levels in 22Rv1 subcutaneous solid tumor xenografts.
Onalespib was administered intraperitoneally at 70 mg/kg in a
twice a week schedule (35). Onalespib reduced tumor growth
signiﬁcantly when administered twice a week (P < 0.001 against
the vehicle control; Fig. 5A) and signiﬁcantly prolonged survival
(Fig. 5B). Weekly treatment at 80 mg/kg did not show signiﬁcant
beneﬁt, suggesting that more frequent dosing is required in this
fast growing model (data not shown). A single administration of

onalespib at 80 mg/kg caused increases in cleaved caspase-3 and
wide areas of necrosis together with reduced Ki67 expression were
observed 48 and 72 hours after drug administration (Fig. 5C).
Reduction in total AR as assessed by an antibody directed against
the AR-NTD was observed (Supplementary Fig. S8). After a single
dose of onalespib AR-V7, mRNA was reduced by 20% after 6 and
24 hours (P < 0.05; Fig. 5D), whereas AR-FL levels were not
signiﬁcantly altered (Fig. 5E). Levels of mRNA at 48 and 72 hours
after drug administration were not evaluated due to the low
amount and poor quality of RNA extracted from these tumors,
in which signiﬁcant tumor cell killing and necrosis were observed
(Fig. 5C). Onalespib treatment also signiﬁcantly downregulated
PSA expression in tumors 24 hours following treatment (Supplementary Fig. S7). Upregulation of HSP72 mRNA and protein by
IHC conﬁrmed HSP90 target engagement (Fig. 5F and Supplementary Figs. S8 and S9).

Discussion
In this study, we examined the effects of HSP90 inhibition in
prostate cancer cell lines expressing the AR-V7 variant. In vitro, the
ﬁrst-generation HSP90 inhibitors tanespimycin and alvespimycin
and the second-generation HSP90 inhibitor onalespib induced
cell growth inhibition and degradation of client proteins, including AR-FL, AKT, and GR. For the ﬁrst time, we demonstrated that
the truncated splice variant AR-V7 protein is depleted when
HSP90 is inhibited. Our results conﬁrmed that AR-V7 protein,
unlike AR-FL, does not require the HSP90 chaperone for its
function and suggested that the mechanism underlying AR-V7
depletion upon HSP90 blockade was not directly linked to
interaction of AR-V7 protein with the HSP90 chaperone. We
demonstrated that AR-V7 mRNA levels were downregulated when
HSP90 was inhibited in a concentration- and time-dependent
fashion. Previous studies have linked heat shock to widespread,
but selective, repression of splicing (42, 43). We therefore hypothesized that the heat shock response induced by HSP90, through
the release of HSF1, can similarly broadly impact alternative
splicing. We have shown that onalespib treatment introduced
743 alternative splicing events involving 557 genes. In keeping
with published data evaluating the impact of heat stress, we
observed a signiﬁcant increase in retention of introns in transcripts and decreased exon skipping (42, 43). Pathway analyses
showed that genes critically important to splicing, including
processing of capped intron–containing pre-mRNA and spliceosome genes, as well as heat shock–related pathways, were significantly enriched in the alternative splicing events induced by
HSP90 inhibition.
Further studies are required to elucidate the complex and multiple mechanisms that can underlie the alternative splicing disruption observed upon HSP90 inhibition. A previous study identiﬁed
the serine/arginine–rich (SR) splicing factors U2AF65 and ASF/SF2
as critical to AR-V7 splicing (45). The function of SR splicing factors
is regulated by their complex interaction with kinases, including the
SR protein kinases (SRPK) and CLK, as well as phosphatases that
regulate their phosphorylation status (46). SRPK1 interacts with
various chaperones and cochaperones, including HSP70, HSP40,
and AHA1 (47). Alternative splicing is also extensively regulated by
signal transduction pathways, whereby signaling cascades can link
the splicing machinery to the exterior environment (48, 49). HSP90
is heavily involved in the function of key nodes in these pathways.
For instance, AKT can directly phosphorylate SR proteins (50) or

2740 Cancer Res; 76(9) May 1, 2016

indirectly regulate SR protein by activating SRPK (51). In addition,
repression of splicing following heat stress has been related to the
SR protein SRP38 (SRSF10) dephosphorylation by the phosphatase PP1 (PPP1CA; ref. 43).
Other groups have evaluated the effect of HSP90 inhibition
on AR-V7 function and activity. Shaﬁ and colleagues used
LNCaP stably transfected with AR-V7 cDNA and demonstrated
no effect on AR-V7 protein levels (52). Gillis and colleagues
demonstrated that AR-V7 transcriptional activity is not altered
by HSP90 inhibition in PC3 cells transfected with prespliced
AR-V7 driven by an ARR2-probasin luciferase (29). They also
demonstrated AR-V7 does not bind HSP90 by coimmunoprecipitation using a FLAG-tagged AR-V7 transfected in PC3 cells.
Our results in cell lines with endogenous AR-V7 support these
observations. However, Gills and colleagues also reported that
treatment of VCaP cells with the second-generation HSP90
inhibitors, luminespib (AUY922) and HSP990, increased ARV7 protein (29), and Shaﬁ and colleagues reported no effect of
geldanamycin on AR-V7 in 22Rv1 cells (52). Their results are
incongruent with what we have observed with different HSP90
inhibitors in three prostate cancer cell lines expressing the ARV7 (VCaP, LNCaP95, and 22Rv1).
In conclusion, our observations conﬁrm that AR-V7 protein
functions independently of HSP90 and that AR-V7 is not a
direct HSP90 client (29). However, we have demonstrated for
the ﬁrst time that HSP90 inhibition leads to the depletion of
AR-V7 protein by downregulating AR-V7 mRNA splicing. AR-V7
splicing was decreased by HSP90 inhibition in prostate cell
lines resistant to androgen depletion and enzalutamide, suggesting that HSP90 inhibition remains a viable approach to
block the generation and possibly the upregulation of AR-V7 in
CRPC. Our data demonstrate a novel mechanism of action for
this class of drugs in prostate cancer cells. Onalespib and other
HSP90 inhibitors are now being tested in proof-of-concept
clinical trials (53, 54). These have included a phase I study of
onalespib in combination with abiraterone acetate in patients
no longer responding to abiraterone (ClinicalTrials.gov identiﬁer: NCT01685268; ref. 55). The impact of HSP90 inhibitors
on not only AR-FL and AR-V7, but also AKT and GR, makes
HSP90 inhibitors a class of drugs that merits further evaluation
against metastatic prostate cancer.
