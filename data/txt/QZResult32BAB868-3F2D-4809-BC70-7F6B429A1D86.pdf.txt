ABSTRACT
Background: Multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) is a rare, systemic
lymphoproliferative disorder driven by interleukin (IL)-6 overproduction. Siltuximab,
an anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody, has demonstrated durable tumor and symptomatic
responses in a multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled study of MCD.
Methods: This preplanned safety analysis was conducted to evaluate the longterm safety of siltuximab treatment among 19 patients with MCD who had stable
disease or better and were enrolled in a phase-1 study and subsequent ongoing, openlabel, phase-2 extension study. Dosing was 11 mg/kg administered intravenously
every 3 weeks, per protocol, or every 6 weeks at the investigator’s discretion. Safety
monitoring focused on potential risks associated with the anti-IL-6 mechanism of
action. Investigator-assessed disease control status was also documented.
Results: Median treatment duration for the 19 patients was 5.1 (range 3.4, 7.2)
years, with 14 (74%) patients treated for >4 years. Grade-≥3 adverse events (AEs)
reported in >1 patient included hypertension (n = 3) and nausea, cellulitis, and fatigue
(n = 2 each). Grade-≥3 AEs at least possibly attributed to siltuximab were leukopenia,
lymphopenia, and a serious AE of polycythemia (n = 1 each). Hypertriglyceridemia
and hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol) were reported in 8 and 9 patients,
respectively. No disease relapses were observed, and 8 of 19 patients were able to
switch to an every-6-week dosing schedule.
Conclusions: All MCD patients in this extension study have received siltuximab
for a prolonged duration (up to 7 years) without evidence of cumulative toxicity or
treatment discontinuations and with few serious infections. All patients are alive,
demonstrate sustained disease control, and continue to receive siltuximab.

of the current study, no standard of care was established
for MCD [2]. Systemic manifestations of MCD include
fever, fatigue, night sweats, wasting, weight loss, and
loss of appetite [3]. While clinical manifestations vary,

abnormalities (eg, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and elevated
acute-phase proteins) are common [1, 4]. Treatment
with siltuximab, an anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody
with high affinity for human IL-6, has demonstrated
efficacy in patients with Castleman disease treated in
a phase 1 clinical trial [5, 6]. More recently, results
from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
study confirmed that siltuximab treatment can yield
durable tumor and symptomatic responses, resolution
of anemia, and improvement in inflammatory disease
parameters in patients with MCD [7] and led to the recent
approvals from the Unites States (US) Food and Drug
Administration [8] and European Commission [9] of
siltuximab for the treatment of patients with MCD who
are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative and
human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) negative.
In phase 1 evaluations, the siltuximab safety profile
was consistent across all dose levels tested. Thus, a
recommended dose of 11 mg/kg was determined based
on efficacy and adequate suppression of C-reactive
protein (CRP) at that dose level. In the aforementioned
randomized study [7], the incidences of grade-≥3 adverse
events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) were
similar between siltuximab and placebo. The most
commonly reported grade-≥3 AEs included fatigue (9%)
and night sweats (8%); infusion reactions were relatively
infrequent (8%) and generally of low grade (1 anaphylactic
reaction led to siltuximab discontinuation) [7]. This safety
profile, however, relates to median treatment durations of
8.5 (range 0.03, 60.5) months (phase 1) [5] and 12.3 (range
0.03, 33.9) months (randomized study) [7]. Thus, this
long-term extension study provides a unique opportunity
to characterize the long-term safety profile of treatment
with siltuximab in patients with MCD.

(range 1.6, 5.0) years while in the phase 1 study. From the
start of the phase 1 study to the data cutoff for the current
interim analysis (January 2013), these patients received
a median of 81 (range 49, 129) doses of siltuximab over
a median of 5.1 (range 3.4, 7.2) years, with 14 (74%) of
patients treated for longer than 4 years. At the time of the
analysis, 11 patients received treatment at q3wks dosing and
8 patients received treatment at q6wks dosing (for 1 patient,
this meant a continuation of the dosing interval within
the phase 1 study). Among these 8 patients, the median
treatment duration on the extended (q6wks) dosing interval
was 11 months (range 5.8 months to 3.8 years). Of note, 1
additional patient started in this study with 4 cycles q6wks
dosing and continued with q3wks dosing. All 19 patients are
alive and continue to receive siltuximab treatment.

Safety
Over the combined time course of the phase 1 and
extension studies (median 5.1 years; range 3.4, 7.2 years),
all patients reported at least 1 AE of any grade, with
upper respiratory tract infection (90%); nausea (63%),
vomiting (58%); diarrhea (53%); hypercholesterolemia
(total cholesterol; 47%); and pain in extremities,
hypertriglyceridemia, headache, rash, and hepatic function
abnormal (42% each) being the most commonly reported
(Figure 1). The most common AEs ( >20%) reported in
the extension study alone were upper respiratory tract
infection (63%); diarrhea (32%); and fatigue, arthralgia,
and pain in extremities (21% each). Those considered
at least possibly attributed to siltuximab were reported
in 6 patients during the extension study and included
pneumonia, tooth abscess, constipation, increased
hemoglobin, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperbilirubinemia,
chronic otitis media, and upper respiratory tract infection
(5% each) and grade-3 leukopenia and lymphopenia (5%
each). When assessed by length of patient treatment/
follow-up, the incidences of AEs for the different system
organ classes were similar or lower during the treatment
periods of 2–4 years and >4 years when compared with
the initial 2 years of treatment (Table 2). In most patients,
the highest grade of AE reported was either grade 2
(37%) or grade 3 (53%); 2 (11%) patients had a grade-4
AE. Grade-≥3 AEs were most commonly reported in the
following system organ classes: gastrointestinal, 6 (32%);
infections, 5 (26%); blood/lymphatic system, 4 (21%);
and general disorders/administration-site, 4 (21%). Most
grade-≥3 AEs were each reported in only 1 patient;
exceptions included 3 (16%) patients with hypertension
and 2 (11%) patients each with nausea, cellulitis, and
fatigue. No patient developed an infusion-related reaction,
nor did any patient develop antibodies against siltuximab
during the extension study.
Also for the combined phase 1 and extension
studies, 5 (26%) patients had SAEs, including 3 (16%)
patients with SAEs during the extension study. Two of
these SAEs (syncope and dyspnea) were considered

RESULTS
Baseline characteristics and disposition
Between April 2011 and January 2013, 19 of the 37
patients with MCD from the previous phase 1 siltuximab
study [5] were enrolled in the study extension and continued
to receive siltuximab at 4 US sites. When these patients
initially commenced siltuximab treatment in the phase 1
study, the median age was 44 (range 18, 76) years and the
median disease duration was 4.8 months (37% of patients
were newly diagnosed). Among the 12 patients with prior
systemic therapy, rituximab (n = 8) and corticosteroids (n
= 6) were the most commonly used (Table 1). Of these 19
patients, 10 (53%) had hyaline vascular and 9 (47%) had
plasmacytic histological subtype. Five patients had a body
mass index (BMI) >40 when entering the extension study,
and an additional 3 had a BMI >30.
At the time of enrollment in the extension study,
the 19 participating patients had received a median of 58
(range 29, 97) doses of siltuximab over a median of 3.3

unrelated to siltuximab, and 1 SAE (polycythemia) was
considered at least possibly attributed to siltuximab.
Twenty days after the third dose of siltuximab in the
extension study (and also following 31 doses in the phase
1 study), a male patient developed grade-3 secondary
polycythemia (hemoglobin of 18.8 g/dL). This SAE
led to hospitalization, resolved with hydration and anticoagulation treatment without complications, and did not
recur despite continued siltuximab treatment. Following a
3-week dose delay, this patient continued siltuximab and
has received 25 cycles (total of 56 doses including phase
1 exposure) as of the cut-off date for this safety analysis.
Nine (47%) patients had a dose delay due to an AE,
4 of which occurred during the extension study and 1 of
which was due to an AE possibly attributed to siltuximab;
no patient discontinued siltuximab due to an AE.
Infections, hyperlipidemia, neutropenia, thrombocy­
topenia, gastrointestinal perforations, infusion-related
reactions, and liver function abnormalities were further
analyzed as AEs of interest in this long-term safety analysis
(Table 3). Most infections were low-grade. Common
infections, irrespective of grade, for the extension study
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

were upper respiratory tract infection (63%), sinusitis
(11%), nasopharyngitis (11%), and pneumonia (11%).
Two (11%) of the extension-study patients reported 1 or
more serious infections during the phase 1 study (abscess
limb, cellulitis, device-related infection, peritoneal
infection, pyelonephritis, vulval abscess, staphylococcal
wound infection); no serious infections were reported
during the extension study. No unusual viral infections
or reactivations were observed; 7 (37%) patients had—
and are currently receiving—prophylactic acyclovir or
valacyclovir; 5 (26%) patients were receiving antivirals
at baseline, prior to any siltuximab treatment, and 6 (32%)
were receiving antiviral prophylaxis during the extension
study. Similarly, no opportunistic fungal infections were
seen. Across the combined phase 1 and extension studies,
the overall incidence of grade-≥3 serious infections was
0.02 per patient-year.
Although hypercholesterolemia (total choles­terol;
47%) and hypertriglyceridemia (42%) were common
among these 19 patients during the phase 1 study, these
elevations were low-grade (9 grade-1 hypercholesterolemia;
5 grade-1 and 3 grade-2 hypertriglyceridemia); 1 patient had

incidence of all-grade hypertriglyceridemia was 0.13 per
patient-year. Of the 19 patients, 6 (32%) had been receiving
lipid-modifying therapy prior to the phase 1 study and 9
(47%) received such therapy during the extension study.
Two patients reported neutropenia, including 1 grade-3 event,
during the extension study; the overall incidence of grade-≥3
neutropenia was 0.01 per patient-year. Thrombocytopenia
(26%) was reported only during the phase 1 study and with
no grade-≥3 events. Because hypertriglyceridemia has
previously been observed in patients who received siltuximab
[5, 6] or other IL-6-inhibiting agents, such as tocilizumab [10,
11], and because siltuximab’s mechanism of action involving
IL-6 blockade may decrease platelet and neutrophil counts in
patients, mean values over time for triglycerides, neutrophils,
and platelets were recorded and are shown in Figure 2A–2C.
Hepatic function abnormalities were reported in 8 (42%)
patients, including 3 grade-1, 4 grade-2, and 1 grade-3 events
during the phase 1 study, while none were reported during
the extension study. Of the 8 patients with hepatic function
abnormalities, 3 had alanine aminotransferase elevations
and 4 had aspartate aminotransferase elevations prior to
receiving siltuximab, while none had abnormal bilirubin
prior to receiving siltuximab. Three patients had grade-2
abnormal total bilirubin during the phase 1 study. No patients
discontinued treatment with siltuximab or had dose delays
due to hepatic abnormalities.

control, including 8 patients whose treatment interval
was lengthened from q3wks to q6wks due to established
prolonged CR. The one additional patient who started in
the extension study on a q6wks dosing interval showed an
increase of clinical symptoms and was switched back to
q3wks dosing after 4 infusions, upon which the symptoms
resolved. The median duration of disease control from
the start of the extension study was 1.5 (range 1.4, 1.6)
years. As such, the overall survival rate in these 19 patients
following a median of 5.1 years of follow-up in the
combined phase 1 and extension studies is 100%.

DISCUSSION
We have previously reported on a phase 1 study [5]
comprising 37 patients with Castleman disease treated
with the anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody siltuximab,
which directly neutralizes IL-6, a key cytokine in the
pathogenesis of MCD. Nineteen patients experienced
significant clinical benefit from siltuximab treatment and
transitioned to an extension study in order to continue
receiving therapy. Disease control was maintained
in all patients during the extension study, and with a
median follow-up of 5.1 (range 3.4, 7.2) years from the
onset of siltuximab, the overall survival rate of these
19 patients was 100%, with nearly three quarters of
patients receiving treatment for longer than 4 years.
The efficacy of siltuximab in MCD has recently been
confirmed in an international randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled study [7], which has led to the first
regulatory approval of siltuximab for MCD in the US
[8] and European Union [9]. Both in the phase 1 [5] and
subsequent randomized study [7], in addition to radiologic
response and symptom control, significant improvement in
inflammatory markers and normalization of hemoglobin
and albumin were also noted.

Efficacy
At the time of extension study start, 1 patient had
CR, 11 had PR, and 7 had stable disease (SD) based on
independent review of radiographic images obtained
during the phase 1 study. During the extension study,
investigator assessment of disease control was documented.

Patients

The present cohort of patients with MCD received
a median of 81 (range 49–129) siltuximab doses. Overall,
siltuximab was well-tolerated, and none of the patients
discontinued therapy. During the study period of >5
years, the most common AEs of any grade were upper
respiratory tract infection, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
and hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol). Adverse
events that occurred during the extension study and were
considered at least possibly attributed to siltuximab included
pneumonia, tooth abscess, constipation, leukopenia,
lymphopenia, increased hemoglobin, hypertriglyceridemia,
hyperbilirubinemia, chronic otitis media, and upper
respiratory tract infection. Incidence of SAEs was low;
during the extension study, 1 patient also developed
a grade-3 SAE, polycythemia, which was considered
treatment-related. Over time, the blood counts remained
stable, and no unusual opportunistic infections were
observed. The overall incidence of grade-≥3 neutropenia
was 0.01/patient-year, and the incidence of grade-≥3 serious
infections was 0.02/patient-year. Low-grade elevation of
total cholesterol and triglycerides was common—47% and
42%, respectively—but all were manageable with lipid
modified agents; 6 (32%) patients received lipid-modifying
agents prior to siltuximab treatment and 9 (47%) received
them during the extension study. A BMI > 30 was recorded
in 7 of the 19 patients prior to siltuximab treatment and
in 8 of 19 patients at the start of the extension study. The
incidences of AEs occurring ≤2, >2–4, and >4 years after
initiation of siltuximab therapy were similar, indicating no
cumulative toxicity. No infusion reactions or development
of antibodies against siltuximab were noted during this
extension study. In total, 9 patients were dosed at q6wks
intervals from the start of the study or switched during the
study. Eight of them maintained q6wks dosing throughout
the study. One patient had to return to a q3wks treatment
interval for symptom control that was maintained with
continued dosing at q3wks. Per protocol, patients were only
allowed to receive treatment either q3wks or q6wks.
Of note, these findings are limited in that they
present on an open-label, single-arm extension study
offered to patients who were responding to siltuximab
treatment.
Nonetheless,
long-term
siltuximab
administration was associated with effective long-term
disease control with a favorable toxicity profile including
when administered over years and is an important addition
to the therapeutic armamentarium for MCD.

Patients with MCD previously enrolled in the openlabel phase 1 siltuximab study were 18 years or older,
HIV-negative and HHV-8-negative, and presented with
active symptomatic MCD. Patients were eligible for the
extension study if: 1) their disease did not progress while
receiving siltuximab, 2) they had no clinically significant
toxicity of grade 2 or higher than the baseline value from
the phase 1 study, and 3) they received the last siltuximab
administration within 6 ± 2 weeks before the first study
extension dose was administered.

Study design
This is an ongoing, open-label, multicenter, singlearm, phase 2 extension study (NCT01400503) to assess
the safety of long-term treatment with siltuximab in MCD
patients who were previously treated in a siltuximab phase
1 study (NCT00412321). The preplanned safety analysis
reported here was conducted 21 months after the start of
patient enrollment in the extension study and includes 19
patients from the preceding phase 1 siltuximab study.
Patients received siltuximab as a 1-hour intravenous
infusion at 11 mg/kg every 3 weeks (q3wks). The
treatment interval could be lengthened to 6 weeks
(q6wks) at the investigator’s discretion for patients with
documented radiographic response (confirmed partial
[PR] or complete [CR] response) for >6 months. Dose
delays of up to 3 weeks were permitted for management
and/or resolution of AEs. All patients were treated with
study agent until they progressed, withdrew consent, or
experienced unacceptable toxicity.

Study evaluations
Adverse events were graded according to the
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Physical examinations
and clinical hematology and chemistry tests were
performed prior to the cycle 1 dose and every 3 cycles
thereafter for patients receiving the q3wks regimen or
every other dosing visit for patients receiving the q6wks
regimen. Lipid panel analyses were done prior to cycle
1 dose and every 6 months thereafter. Investigators
assessed disease control during screening; at cycles
4, 7, and 10; every 6 months thereafter; and within 4
weeks following the time of siltuximab discontinuation.
Laboratory assessments for erythrocyte sedimentation
rate (ESR), CRP, and fibrinogen were performed at these
same timepoints. For those who discontinued treatment,
survival status and subsequent MCD therapies were to
be collected until the patient was lost to follow-up or
withdrew consent for the study, until 50% of patients
died, or until the end of the study—whichever occurred
first. Survival status will be collected twice a year for

Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize
data. No formal hypothesis testing was performed. The
sample size of this extension study was determined by the
eligibility of patients transitioning from the phase 1 to the
phase 2 study and not dictated by statistical calculation.
Demographics and disease characteristics were reported
from the phase 1 study [5]. Exposure and safety data from
the 19 patients who were enrolled in the phase 1 study and
in the extension study were combined for analysis. Due
to the long treatment duration, safety analyses included
both cumulative incidence for all AEs and incidence per
patient-years of exposure for AEs of clinical interest.
Efficacy was assessed using central imaging data during
the phase 1 study and using the investigator’s assessment
of disease control (specifically, proportions of previouslyresponding patients and siltuximab-naïve patients who
maintained disease control) and duration of disease control
during the phase 2 extension study.
