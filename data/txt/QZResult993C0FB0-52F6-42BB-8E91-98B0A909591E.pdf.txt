BACKGROUND: Serum and plasma levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) correlate with prognosis in patients with
metastatic breast cancer (MBC). VEGF binds to 2 receptors on endothelial cells, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. RPI.4610 (Angiozyme0) is an
antiangiogenic ribozyme targeting the VEGFR-1 mRNA. Preclinical and phase 1 studies suggested that RPI.4610 is a well-tolerated
agent with clinical activity in solid tumors. The authors’ trial evaluated the efficacy of RPI.4610 in the treatment of patients with progressive MBC. METHODS: This phase 2, multicenter, single-arm study was designed to assess the objective response rate of RPI.4610
in patients with MBC who had experienced disease progression with at least 1 course of chemotherapy for MBC. Patients received
daily subcutaneous injections of RPI.4610 100 mg/m2 for 12 weeks. RESULTS: Most patients (93%) had received at least 2 lines of
chemotherapy previously; 69% of patients had received at least 3 lines of chemotherapy. Median follow-up was 2.76 months (range,
0.89-36.6 months). No partial responses nor complete responses were found. Median progression-free survival was 1.41 months (95%
confidence interval [CI], 1.35-1.45). The median overall survival from start of treatment was 11.89 months (95% CI, 4.11-23.66).
Treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were primarily grade 1 to 2 in intensity. Most common AEs were: injection site reactions,
abdominal pain, anorexia, chromaturia, constipation, dyspnea, fatigue, headache, pain at the injection site, nausea, vomiting, and fever.
CONCLUSIONS: Although RPI.4610 demonstrated a well-tolerated safety profile, its lack of clinical efficacy precludes this drug from

INTRODUCTION
Within the intricate web of angiogenesis and its importance in the pathogenesis of malignancies, vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) has established an important role in tumor growth and dissemination. Serum and plasma levels of
VEGF, a mitogen specific for vascular endothelial cells, correlate with prognosis in patients with metastatic breast cancer
(MBC).1 VEGF binds to 2 receptors on endothelial cells, flt-1 (VEGFR-1) and flk-1/KDR receptor (VEGFR-2).2 Both
of these receptors have shown roles in VEGF-induced cellular proliferation. Blockade of flt-1 has resulted in inhibition of
tumor proliferation and metastasis of solid tumors.3,4 The expression of the flk-1 receptor is involved in endothelial cell
proliferation, as well as regulation of cell to cell interactions.5,6 Given these findings, interruption of VEGF signaling may
be an effective means to reduce tumor growth.
One mechanism of inhibiting VEGF activity lies in the use of hammerhead ribozymes, which are trans-acting,
RNA-based enzymes that bind and cleave the mRNAs that encode for the VEGF receptor proteins in a sequence-specific
manner.7,8 This sequence specificity results from direct base pairing of a ribozyme to nucleotides in the target RNA. Ribozyme cleavage of mRNA prevents normal translation and results in a decrease in the expression of the encoded proteins.
RPI.4610 (Angiozyme; Sirna Therapeutics, San Francisco, Calif) is an antiangiogenic ribozyme targeting the
VEGFR-1 mRNA, thus reducing the cell surface receptor and its soluble form (sVEGFR-1). RPI.4610 has effectively
decreased VEGF expression, tumor growth, and metastasis in animal models of solid tumors.8-10 Phase 1 clinical studies
have demonstrated that RPI.4610, when administered as monotherapy or in combination with carboplatin, was well tolerated and had activity in advanced solid tumors.7,11 Dose and schedule of RPI.4610 were determined by previous experience in preclinical and phase 1 studies. Initially, animal studies established the safety of daily subcutaneous dosing of
RPI.4610, at doses up to 300 mg/m2/d, in mouse and monkey models. A subsequent phase 1-2 trial established that the
300-mg/m2 dose, administered subcutaneously, was well tolerated. In addition, pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated
that RPI.4610, when administered in the dose and schedule used in this study, resulted in good bioavailability and

prolonged plasma concentrations. As the results of the
preclinical and phase 1 studies suggested that RPI.4610 is
a safe agent that may produce meaningful clinical
responses in patients with MBC (MBC), this phase 2 trial
was developed to evaluate the efficacy of RPI.4610 in the
treatment of patients with progressive MBC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility

Women aged 18 years with MBC who had progressive
disease after at least 1 chemotherapy regimen were eligible
for inclusion. If the patient had experienced disease progression on endocrine therapy, she was eligible to enroll in
this study 7 days after completing the endocrine therapy.
If patients had recently been treated with chemotherapy
or immunotherapy, they became eligible for enrollment
in the study after they had fully recovered from the toxicity of the previous chemotherapy. Patients had to have at
least 1 radiographically measurable target lesion as
assessed by the investigator. Documentation of the progressive metastatic disease could occur by a suitable imaging study, biopsy, or physical examination. Eligible
patients had to have a Karnofsky performance status of at
least 70%, and their survival should be estimated to be >3
months. Women of childbearing potential had a negative
pregnancy test before enrollment and were advised to use
effective barrier contraceptive measures beginning 1
month before enrollment and continuing for 1 month
past the end of the trial. In addition, eligibility criteria
required adequate organ function: aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase <3  the upper limits of normal, total bilirubin 1.5  the upper limit of
normal (unless the patient had a history of Gilbert syndrome), alkaline phosphatase that 2.5  the upper limits of normal, creatinine 2 mg/dL, white blood cell
count 3  109/L, hemoglobin 9.5 g/dL, platelet count
100  109/L, prothrombin time <15 seconds, and
international normalized ratio <1.5.
Exclusion criteria included: prior treatment with an
antiangiogenic agent, bone-only metastatic disease, presence of brain metastases based upon baseline computed
tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging of the
head, major surgery within 28 days before starting the
study, systemic infection requiring antibiotics within 28
days before study initiation, pregnancy or lactation, significant cardiac disease (New York Heart Association class
III or IV) or other systemic disease that would interfere
with the ability of the patient to undertake the study,
uncontrolled hypertension, concomitant intake of anticoCancer

agulants or immunosuppressive agents, and recent drug
or alcohol use.
Study Design

This phase 2, multicenter, single-arm study was designed
to assess the objective response rate of RPI.4610 in
patients with progressive MBC who had failed at least 1
course of chemotherapy for metastatic disease. The centers included: Cleveland Clinic, City of Hope National
Medical Center, University of California at San Francisco,
University of Colorado Health Science Breast Center,
Providence Portland Medical Center, and The University
of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. The study was
conducted under the Investigational New Drug application submitted by Ribozyme Pharmaceuticals, Inc. After
approval by each institution’s institutional review board,
patients received daily subcutaneous injections of
RPI.4610 100 mg/m2 for 12 weeks, during which the
patients underwent clinical assessments that included
imaging studies, performance status evaluations, and clinical safety evaluations. Patients who did not progress were
eligible to continue on the study medicine indefinitely.
All patients were reassessed at 6-week intervals; this evaluation included performance of CT of the body location at
which disease had been noted on the screening CT, as well
as locations for which the patient noted new symptoms. If
the CT demonstrated complete or partial response, then a
confirmatory CT was to be performed within 4 to 6
weeks. Response to RPI.4610 was evaluated by Response
Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors based on the percentage of complete responders and partial responders
during the 12-week trial.12
The primary efficacy objective of this study was to
determine the objective response rate of tumors to
RPI.4610 in patients with progressive MBC who have
failed at least 1 regimen of chemotherapy. The secondary
objective was to determine the percentage of patients with
stable disease at 12 weeks and at 24 weeks after initiation
of RPI.4610 therapy.
Treatment Plan

RPI.4610 was supplied as a lyophilized drug (225 mg in
each 10-mL vial). The clinical pharmacist reconstituted
the drug with 0.45% normal saline. Each patient was then
supplied with dispenser kits, a cooler, and ice packs for
transport of the drug from the clinic. Drug was stored in
the refrigerator, and the patient (or caregiver) removed a
vial of drug from the refrigerator just before use.
Patients self-administered RPI.4610 100 mg/m2
subcutaneously on a daily basis for 12 consecutive weeks.
Calculation of the dose was performed by the dispensing

pharmacist, who determined the daily dose based upon
the body surface area (BSA) as measured on day 1. If the
patient’s BSA was >2.25 m2, the dose of RPI.4610 was
capped at 225 mg/d. The same dose was used for a given
patient throughout the trial, and no dose reductions were
allowed. Dose volume was calculated according to the following formula: (100 mg/m2  BSA)/150 mg/mL.
Patients were allowed to continue on RPI.4610 treatment
after 12 weeks if there had been no documented disease
progression.
Initially, study drug was dispensed every 2 weeks
during the first 12 weeks of study. Subsequently, patients
were provided with a 21-day supply. Only patients who
took at least 70% of their intended dose or had progressive disease were considered evaluable for the secondary
efficacy analysis. In addition, during the course of the
study, patients maintained a daily diary that listed the
volume of drug administered, the date and time that the
drug was administered, the location where the drug was
administered, and deviations from the prescribed dose
volume.
Efficacy Assessment and Response Criteria

During the first 12 weeks, each patient had tumor measurements within 2 weeks of registration, at week 7, and at
week 13. After the first 12 weeks of the study, patients
entered a maintenance phase, during which they underwent tumor measurements every 6 weeks. Tumor measurements were also taken upon the patient’s withdrawal
from the study. Response was defined according to
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors guidelines.12 All measurable lesions, up to a maximum of 5
lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total that were representative of all involved organs, were identified as target
lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. All other
lesions were identified as nontarget lesions and were also
recorded at baseline. The best overall response was defined
as the best response recorded from the start of treatment
until disease progression, taking as reference the smallest
measurements recorded since the treatment started. Duration of overall response was measured from the time that
measurement criteria were met for complete response or
partial response until the first date at which recurrence or
progressive disease was objectively documented. Stable
disease was measured from the start of treatment until the
criteria for progression were met, taking as reference the
smallest measurement recorded since the treatment
started. Levels of biomarkers, including sVEGFR-1, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (sVCAM), and soluble
(s)E-selectin were assayed at baseline and after 6 weeks of
4100

therapy, to determine whether changes in these biomarkers correlated to clinical response.
Statistical Design and Methodology

The primary efficacy analysis was response to treatment.
The trial was designed to test the hypothesis that the
response rate (complete response þ partial response) to
RPI.4610 would be >5%, using data on all patients on an
intent to treat basis. The median duration of response,
median progression-free survival, and median overall survival were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Duration of response was calculated as the number of days
from the date of response to the date of progression. Progression-free and overall survival were calculated as the
number of days from first dose of RPI.4610 to the date of
disease progression and death, respectively.
Sample size was determined using exact binomial
probabilities. A sample of 40 patients, provided the trial
92.4% power to detect that the response rate was greater
than 5%, using a one-sided exact binomial test with a significance level of 0.05, when the true response rate was 20%.
Toxicity Assessment

Physical examination and performance status assessment
occurred before initiation of therapy, every 6 weeks during the study, and upon patient withdrawal from the
study. Adverse events were evaluated continuously
(through daily patient diaries) and graded according to
the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Grading
Scale (version 2.0). Hematology, blood chemistry, and
urinalysis were assessed at baseline, every 6 weeks during
the study, and upon patient withdrawal from the study.
Correlative Studies

To determine the relationship between soluble vascular
biomarkers and response to RPI.4610, serum samples
were drawn from patients at baseline and after 6 weeks
(43 days) of treatment for 31 of the patients. These samples were evaluated for levels of sVEGFR-1, sVEGFR-2,
sVCAM, and sE-selectin. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assays specific for each protein target were used (R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, Minn).
RESULTS
Patients

Between April 8, 2001 and August 9, 2002, 45 patients
received treatment at 7 sites. Patient demographic characteristics and baseline disease characteristics are listed in
Table 1. Overall, the trial patients represented a heavily
pretreated population. Most patients (93%) had received
at least 2 lines of chemotherapy previously; 69% of
patients had received at least 3 lines of chemotherapy

complete responses were found. At the time of analysis, all
evaluable patients had demonstrated progression of disease. Median progression-free survival was 1.41 months
(95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35-1.45; Fig. 1). Of the
45 patients included in the survival analysis, there were 20
deaths, and 25 patients were lost to follow-up/censored.
The median overall survival from start of treatment was
11.89 months (95% CI, 4.11-23.66; Fig. 2).

(Table 2). In addition, 6 (13%) patient had received prior
taxanes, 2 (4%) had received anthracyclines, and 35
(78%) had been treated with both taxane-based and
anthracycline-based chemotherapy previously. Twentyfive (56%) patients had received prior endocrine therapy.
Efficacy

Progression-free survival information was available on 45
patients, and analysis is based on this population. Median
follow-up was 2.76 months (range, 0.89-36.6 months),
based on time from start of treatment until death or
becoming lost to follow-up. No partial responses or

Tolerability

RPI.4610 demonstrated an acceptable safety profile.
There were no treatment-related deaths. Treatmentrelated adverse events (AEs) were generally manageable
and primarily grade 1 to 2 in intensity. The most common
adverse effects were: injection site reactions, abdominal
pain, anorexia, chromaturia, constipation, dyspnea, fatigue, headache, pain at the injection site, nausea, vomiting, and fever. Interestingly, the adverse effects typically
associated with VEGF inhibition, including hypertension,
proteinuria, and thrombosis, were not seen with this
regimen.
In total, 39 patients had at least 1 treatment-related
event. Injection-related skin reaction/discomfort
accounted for the greatest number of AEs (n ¼ 24). Seven
patients demonstrated gastrointestinal disorders, such as
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and constipation. Two
patients discontinued therapy because of treatmentrelated AEs, relating to cholestatic jaundice and neuropathy. In total, 3 patients developed grade 3 to 4 toxicity,
related to cholestatic jaundice, arthralgias, and neuropathic pain (Table 3). Missed doses occurred in 11 (24%)
patients. Three (6.7%) patients had dose modifications.

increase when comparing day 43 to baseline concentrations
(838  39 pg/mL to 663  34 pg/mL; P < .001; n ¼ 31).
In contrast, sVEGFR-2 and sE-selectin levels remained

VEGF levels were assessed at baseline and after 43 days of
therapy in 26 patients. VEGF levels were below the limits
of detection in 15 patients at baseline and in 12 patients at
day 43 with no apparent changes. As no objective responses
to RPI.4610 monotherapy were seen, there appeared to be
no correlation between changes in these biomarkers and
clinical response.

However, despite advances in the treatment of MBC,
only 2 further targeted agents have shown the ability to
improve progression-free (and/or overall) survival: bevacizumab and trastuzumab.14,15 Thus, the need for improvements in personalized medicine clearly exists, and this
study attempted to widen the realm of treatment regimens
for patients with MBC. Unfortunately, although the
study demonstrated that RP14610 is a well-tolerated
agent, with a manageable adverse event profile, this agent
did not demonstrate significant efficacy in this heavily
pretreated patient population.
The lack of efficacy seen in this study is likely multifactorial. First of all, this agent was used in a group of
patients who had received multiple prior chemotherapy
regimens (median, 4; range, 1-11). Notably, only 1 published trial has shown that bevacizumab, another agent
that is active against VEGF, has improved progressionfree survival; this trial used bevacizumab in the first-line
setting.14 Thus, utilization of RPI.4610 in this chemotherapy-refractory patient group decreased the probability
of discovering a significant response. In addition, experiences with previous targeted agents active against vascular
endothelial growth factor, such as bevacizumab, have
demonstrated the need for using these agents in combination with cytotoxic therapy to attain significant clinical
benefit.16 However, at the time of the conception of this
trial, a phase 1 study by Weng and colleagues had demonstrated evidence suggesting that RPI.4610 monotherapy
was clinically effective, leading to the choice of this regimen.11 Although Weng et al had used doses up to 300
mg/m2/d, the 2 responses noted in the phase 1 trial had
occurred in patients who received lower doses (10 mg/m2/
d and 100 mg/m2/d), supporting the use of this dose for
the current trial.
The correlative study findings raised interesting
questions. The finding of a decline in sVEGFR-1 but not
sVEGFR-2 in these patients confirms the selectivity of
this agent and suggests that target inhibition occurred. In
addition, similar to a colorectal cancer trial finding that
high levels of sVCAM correlated with poor outcomes, the
findings of significant elevations in sVCAM in all evaluated patients in this trial appeared to serve as a possible
Cancer

early predictor of poor response.17 In contrast, studies
involving bevacizumab have demonstrated that changes in
sVEGFR-2 and sVCAM-1 levels were not predictive of
response.18
Interestingly, the adverse event profile for this regimen differed significantly from other agents such as bevacizumab that target VEGF. RPI.4610 was associated with
fatigue, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and abdominal
discomfort; it did not cause any reported incidence of
hypertension, proteinuria, or thrombosis. These findings
raise the question of whether target inhibition occurred.
Previous phase 1 data has demonstrated that RPI.4610
demonstrated acceptable bioavailability when given at
these doses. However, although localization of RPI.4610
has been verified in tumor samples in a small population
of patients, the heterogeneity of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2
staining in the vascular endothelial cells of the tumor samples precluded determination of the relative effect of
RPI.4610 on VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 expression. In
addition, although previous pharmacokinetic studies have
shown that RPI.4610 demonstrated acceptable bioavailability (mean, >50%), higher levels may be required to
ensure target inhibition.11 Thus, the question of whether
adequate inhibition of VEGF signaling occurred remains
a viable issue. This may suggest that synthetic anti-RNA
molecules do not effectively or efficiently cross the cell
membrane or that the biology is more complex than simply blocking selective RNA.
Based upon the evidence presented, RPI.4610 is a
well-tolerated agent that has limited efficacy in patients
with MBC. Its struggle in the field of breast cancer echoes
the toils of antisense regimens that have also been used
against this disease. Therapies such as the Bcl-2 antisense
oligonucleotide have confirmed the dilemma of achieving
target inhibition. In a phase 1-2 study of G3139, a Bcl-2
antisense oligonucleotide, no additional efficacy was
found when G3139 was combined with doxorubicin and
docetaxel.19 Pretreatment and post-treatment biopsies
demonstrated that G3139 did not significantly inhibit
Bcl-2 expression in the majority of the tumors sampled.
Similarly, a recent trial of OGX-011, an antisense oligonucleotide that inhibits clusterin expression, demonstrated that this drug, whether delivered as monotherapy
or in combination with docetaxel, had insufficient activity
to warrant further investigation.20 Like our study, OGX011 was associated with decreased serum clusterin levels
in the majority of patients, but this decline in serum levels
did not correlate with activity.
One issue that is crucial pertains to the assessment of
target inhibition. Pretreatment and post-treatment biopCancer

September 1, 2012

sies are crucial to this assessment, and timing may be key
in this endeavor. For example, if a drug produces significant apoptosis, a biopsy that is timed too late may miss
the peak of apoptosis. To address such a possibility, trials
such as the phase 1 trial of AEG35156 (an antisense to
human x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis) also measured levels of full-length and/or caspase-cleaved cytokeratin 18
(M65/M30), the ratio of which correlates with apoptosis.21 Beyond the issue of timing, there is the key issue of
whether synthetic anti-RNA molecules effectively or efficiently cross the cell membrane.
In conclusion, although RPI.4610 demonstrated a
well-tolerated safety profile, its lack of clinical efficacy precludes this drug from further development. Unfortunately, the shortcomings of RPI.4610 echo the inability of
the anti-RNA molecules to successfully inhibit their target. With the exception of fomivirsen, which is a direct
intravitreal injection for the treatment of cytomegalovirus
retinitis, these agents have been unable to produce clinical
responses that would lead to further drug development.
This lack of success suggests that, beyond inhibition of
RNA, further investigation of modalities to enable target
inhibition is essential to advance this field.
