Abstract
The binding of exogenous nicotine to nicotinic acetylcholine
(ACh) receptors (nAChR) and the binding of endogenous ACh
to both nAChR and muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChR)
stimulate growth of both small cell and non–small cell lung
carcinomas. Understanding how cholinergic signaling is upregulated in lung cancer may suggest new therapeutic
approaches. Analysis of 28 squamous cell lung carcinomas
(SCC) showed increased levels of A5 and B3 nAChR mRNA and
increased levels of ACh associated with increased levels of
choline acetyltransferase mRNA and decreased cholinesterase
mRNAs. Lynx1, an allosteric inhibitor of nAChR activity, was
also decreased in SCC. Thus, cholinergic signaling is broadly
increased in SCC caused by increased levels of receptors,
increased levels of ligands, and decreased levels of receptor
inhibitors. Partially explaining the cholinergic up-regulation
seen in SCC, incubation of the H520 SCC cell line with nicotine
increased levels of ACh secretion, increased expression of
nAChR, and, as measured by electrophysiologic recording,
increased activity of the expressed nAChR. Consistent with
these effects, nicotine stimulated proliferation of H520 cells.
One approach to blocking proliferative effects of nicotine and
ACh on growth of lung cancers may be through M3 mAChR
antagonists, which can limit the activation of mitogenactivated protein kinase that is caused by both nicotinic and
muscarinic signaling. This was tested with the M3-selective
muscarinic antagonist darifenacin. Darifenacin blocked nicotine-stimulated H520 growth in vitro and also blocked H520
growth in nude mice in vivo. Thus, cholinergic signaling is
broadly up-regulated in SCC and blocking cholinergic signaling can limit basal and nicotine-stimulated growth of SCC.

Introduction
Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer death in the
United States with deaths in 2007 estimated to exceed 160,000 (1).
Lung cancer is classified into small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC),
which accounts for approximately 14% to 20% of cases, and non-

SCLC (NSCLC), which accounts for the remaining cases. NSCLC
consists primarily of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and
adenocarcinoma. Despite improvements in responses to increasingly sophisticated combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy (2), survival remains low. Thus, the development of new
therapeutic approaches is clearly needed.
Smoking is associated with the vast majority of lung cancer (3).
Although the primary mechanism of smoking-induced carcinogenesis derives from carcinogens in smoke, recent data show that
nicotine and nitrosamines in smoke bind to nicotinic acetylcholine
(ACh) receptors (nAChR) on lung cancers to stimulate growth and
potentially tumor progression (4–9). Expression of nAChR is seen
in both SCLC and NSCLC (4, 10–12). Expression of nAChR in lung
cancers derives from expression of nAChR in normal lung cells.
Normal bronchial epithelial cells express nAChR as part of a
cholinergic autocrine loop (13–16) in which all proteins needed for
cholinergic signaling are present, including the ACh-synthesizing
enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the vesicular ACh
transporter (VAChT), the high-affinity choline transporter CHT1,
the ACh hydrolyzing enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and
butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), nAChRs, and muscarinic ACh
receptors (mAChR). We and others have also shown that the
interaction of ACh with both nAChR and mAChR stimulates cell
proliferation (11, 17–20), and we have previously reported that
SCLC similarly express this cholinergic autocrine loop and that
muscarinic antagonists can inhibit SCLC cell proliferation.
Whereas the expression of nAChR in SCC has been described,
the expression of the complete cholinergic autocrine loop in SCC
has yet to be described. In this article, we show that SCC, like SCLC,
expresses a cholinergic autocrine loop. Lam and colleagues (10)
recently reported in a series of NSCLC (predominantly adenocarcinomas) that some nAChRs are changed in tumor relative to
normal lung and that nicotine exposure seems to change receptor
expression. As we show here, changes in cholinergic signaling in
SCC are not limited just to nAChR expression but large changes in
ACh synthesis and degradation are also present. Given the upregulation of cholinergic signaling in lung cancer, the role of
smoking and continued stimulation of cancer cells by nicotine is of
obvious importance. The interaction of nicotine with its receptor
can lead to receptor inactivation or receptor activation depending
on receptor subtype and cell type. Here, we show that nicotine upregulates both nAChR expression and activity.
West and colleagues (4) and Tsurutani and colleagues (21) have
shown Akt activation by nicotine, and our lab and other
laboratories have also shown mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) activation by nicotine (6, 22–24). Endogenous ACh
released from lung cancers signals through both nAChR and

mAChR and also leads to Akt and MAPK activation (22). Because
MAPK is activated by both nicotinic and muscarinic pathways and
we have previously shown that M3 muscarinic antagonists
decrease basal MAPK activation as well as blocking ACh-induced
MAPK and Akt, M3 muscarinic antagonists present a potential
approach to blocking both nicotinic and muscarinic proliferative
pathways. In this article, we also show that muscarinic M3
antagonists can block basal proliferation of SCC as well as nicotinestimulated SCC proliferation.

Materials and Methods
SCC cell lines and SCC samples. The SCC cell line H520 [American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC)] was used for most studies and maintained
as recommended by ATCC. For analysis of expression of cholinergic RNAs
and Western blot analysis, 28 frozen archival SCC samples were obtained
from the tumor bank of the Department of Pathology of the Oregon Health
and Science University (OHSU). For 6 of the 28 samples, adjacent normal
tissue was also available. H&E-stained slides of the samples were reviewed

to confirm diagnosis and establish degree of differentiation. For immunohistochemical analysis of cholinergic gene expression, another 31 archival,
paraffin-embedded SCC samples were obtained from the OHSU Department
of Pathology. For high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis
of ACh content of SCC, an additional eight SCC and eight normal lung
samples were obtained form the OHSU tumor bank. An additional six SCC
cell lines (H647, H1703, H1869, H2066, HTB-58, and HTB-59) from ATCC
were also screened for cholinergic components and responses.
Real-time PCR and Western blots. Real-time PCR was used to quantify
cholinergic gene expression in tumor samples as previously described
(11, 25). Total RNA and protein in SCC and the normal lung tissues were
prepared with TRI-reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.; ref. 26). The
probes and primers used in real-time PCRs were as described previously
(11) or are listed in Supplementary Table S1. All reactions were run in
triplicate and RNA levels were normalized to 18S RNA expression as an
internal standard. In addition, no-reverse transcriptase controls were run
with all RNAs to check for genomic DNA contamination. Western blot
analysis was performed as described previously (25) using actin as an
internal standard. Antibodies are as described below for immunohistochemistry.
Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry was performed as
previously described (11, 15, 22). Antibodies used were anti-ChAT
(MAB305); anti-AChE (MAB337) from Chemicon International, Inc.; antiVAChT (H-V005) from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals; anti-CHT1 generously
provided by R. Blakely (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN; ref. 11); and
anti-Lynx1 as previously described (25). Muscarinic receptor antibodies
were as follows: anti-M2 (WR-3791) from R&D Systems and anti-M3 (H210)
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (11, 15, 25). Nicotinic receptor antibodies
were as follows: anti-a3 (mAb356), anti-a4 (mAb299), anti-a7 (mAb319),
anti-h2 (mAb3724), and anti-h4 (mAb337) as described by Song and
colleagues (11) and Sekhon and colleagues (15) and anti-h3 from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. Immunostaining was independently scored by two readers
on a scale from 0 to 4, where 0 = no staining, 1 = focal weak staining,
2 = diffuse weak staining or focal strong staining, 3 = diffuse medium
staining, and 4 = diffuse strong staining. The readers were blinded to each
other’s results and other reads on the slides.
ACh assay. ACh synthesis by SCC was assayed by HPLC as described
previously (11). For measurement of ACh in tissue, 100 to 200 mg of samples
were homogenized in 2 mL of 90% methanol containing 0.1 mol/L formic
acid and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min. Supernatant (1 mL) was
lyophilized and stored at 80jC. The dried samples were dissolved in 80 to
120 AL of the HPLC mobile phase and filtered and 10 AL were injected into
the HPLC. Each sample was measured at least in duplicate. Standard ACh
(2 nmol/L) was added to 2 mL 90% methanol and processed as above for
determination of ACh recovery. For measurement of ACh secretion by SCC
cell lines, 500,000 cells in 1 mL fresh medium were plated into each well of

24-well dishes and neostigmine (5  10 5 mol/L; Sigma-Aldrich) was added
to all dishes to inhibit ACh degradation. Twenty-four and 48 h after plating,
supernatants were collected, frozen on dry ice, and stored at 80jC.
Calcium fluorometry. Changes in SCC cell line intracellular calcium
concentration [Ca2+]i elicited by ACh was measured fluorometrically using a
FlexStation (Molecular Devices Corp.) as described previously (22). Drugs
used (ACh, carbachol, mecamylamine, and atropine; Sigma-Aldrich) were
diluted to desired concentrations with HBSS supplemented by 20 mmol/L
HEPES plus 2 mmol/L CaCl2 and applied at the concentrations shown in
the results.
Electrophysiology. Cells were transferred to a recording chamber
mounted on the stage of a Leica microscope and perfused with Krebs
solution with the following composition (in mmol/L): 140 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.8
CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 5 glucose (pH 7.3; osmolarity, 300 mOsm). Cells
were perfused at 2 to 3 mL/min with bathing solution at room temperature.
Drugs were applied by fast step perfusion system (SF-77B perfusion, Warner
Instruments). To isolate inward currents, an internal pipette solution with the
following composition was used (in mmol/L): 130 CsCl, 1 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2,
10 EGTA, 10 HEPES, and 4 Mg-ATP (pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH). Wholecell currents were recorded from H520 cell using standard patch-clamp
techniques (27). The resistance of the recording pipettes was 3 to 5 MV.
Cells were voltage clamped at 60 mV. A MultiClamp 700B (Axon
Instruments) was used to record whole-cell currents. Voltage clamp
protocols, data acquisition, and analysis were performed using DigiData
1322A interface and pClamp9 software (Axon Instruments).
Cell proliferation assay. H520 SCC cells were used to determine the
ability of the M3 antagonist darifenacin to inhibit nicotine-stimulated
proliferation. Cells were plated at a concentration of 2,500 per well as
described above. The following day, cells were changed to medium
containing 1% FCS plus drugs as described in Results. Cell density was
monitored using the CellTiter-Blue assay (Promega Corp.) as previously
described (22).
Nude mice studies. For tumor xenograft growth studies, male mice
(nu/nu; Charles River Laboratories) were injected with H520 SCC tumor cells
and treated with the M3 receptor antagonist darifenacin and tumor growth
was monitored. Darifenacin was generously provided by Novartis Pharma
AG. H520 cells were grown as described above, and 5  106 cells were
injected s.c. into the right flank of each mouse as described previously (22).
Tumors were allowed to grow for 1 wk, and then drug administration was

initiated and continued for the next 4 wk. Darifenacin was dissolved in 50%
DMSO/50% PBS and administered by s.c. implanted osmotic minipumps
(Alzet model 2004) at doses of 6.0 mg/kg/d. Control animals received
minipumps filled with 50% DMSO/50% PBS. Tumor volume was determined
weekly by measuring with calipers (volume = height  width  depth).
The study was terminated after 4 wk of drug administration. Ten animals
were used per group. At sacrifice, tumors were removed and weighed.
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as mean F SE. Data of real-time
PCR and Western blot analysis were analyzed by t test using NCSS 2004
statistical software. EC50 and IC50 in the Calcium fluorometry were
calculated with the SoftMax program 4.0.1 provided by Molecular Devices.
Cell proliferation was analyzed by one- or two-way ANOVA followed by
Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison tests.

Results
Expression of cholinergic mRNAs and proteins in SCC. Realtime PCR was performed to characterize cholinergic gene
expression in 28 SCC tumors and 6 adjacent normal tissues as
described in Materials and Methods. Frozen SCC samples were
obtained from the OHSU tumor bank and diagnosis and histologic
grade were confirmed by examination of H&E-stained sections of
the same tumors. As shown in Fig. 1A, the enzymes necessary for
the synthesis and degradation of ACh were all present in SCC.
ChAT was significantly increased in SCC compared with adjacent
normal tissue, whereas levels of CHT1 and VAChT were not
significantly changed (Fig. 1A). Levels of mRNA that encode
proteins that serve to limit cholinergic signaling, AChE, BChE, and
Lynx1, were all significantly decreased in tumors compared with
controls (Fig. 1A). All nicotinic receptors measured in tumors
trended higher than in normal tissues and levels of a5 and h3 were
significantly increased in the tumors (Fig. 1B). Levels of M2 mAChR
mRNA were significantly decreased in tumors compared with
controls, whereas significant differences between tumors and
controls were not seen in levels of M3 and M4 mAChR mRNA
(Fig. 1C). Changes in cholinergic protein levels as measured by
Western blot analysis mirrored changes in RNA levels and

significant decreases in levels of AChE, M2, and Lynx1 between
tumors and controls were observed (data not shown). Levels of M3
and M4 by Western blotting were not significantly different between
groups (data not shown). The differences in cholinergic mRNAs
between tumors and normals tended to increase as tumors became
less differentiated. Levels of ChAT, a5 nAChR, and M3 mAChR
trended higher in less differentiated SCC and levels of Lynx1 and
AChE RNA trended lower in less differentiated SCC (Fig. 1D).
Next, the expression of cholinergic proteins in SCC by
immunohistochemistry was determined in 31 SCC tumors (Fig. 2).
As can be seen in Fig. 2A, consistent with the analysis of mRNA
expression, the majority of SCC expressed the proteins needed to
both synthesize ACh and to respond to ACh through both the
nicotinic and muscarinic cholinergic pathways. Representative
staining for ChAT, CHT1, and AChE is shown in Fig. 2B.
Approximately 60% of SCC expressed ChAT by immunohistochemistry and essentially all expressed at least one subtype of nicotinic
or muscarinic receptors. Thus, the majority of SCC can synthesize
ACh and almost all would respond to exogenous ACh or nicotine.
In addition, as listed in Materials and Methods, seven SCC cell
lines were analyzed for ChAT and cholinergic receptor expression.
Similar to the tumor samples, all SCC cell lines examined expressed
at least one subtype of nicotinic or muscarinic receptor and six of
seven cell lines expressed ChAT (data not shown). Six of seven SCC
lines examined also showed increased intracellular calcium in
response to ACh challenge. Because the H520 SCC cell line proved
the most amenable for patch clamp analysis, it was used for more
detailed studies as described below.
ACh is elevated in SCC. Because the presence of the enzyme to
synthesize ACh does not guarantee actual production of ACh, levels
of ACh were assayed in eight additional tumor samples and eight
normal lung samples (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 3A, high levels of ACh
were present in six of eight tumor samples but nearly undetectable
in all but one normal lung sample. This is consistent with the
dramatic difference in ChAT mRNA levels between tumor and
adjacent normal tissues shown in Fig. 1A and the decreased levels
of cholinesterase shown in Fig. 1D. As shown in Fig. 3B, nicotine
exposure may play a role in up-regulating ACh levels in tumors as
incubation of the H520 SCC cell line with nicotine mildly, but
significantly, increased ACh secretion by SCC cells under conditions
(10% FCS) in which nicotine did not increase cell number.
Nicotine up-regulates and activates nicotinic receptors in
SCC. To assess how chronic nicotine exposure affects nAChR
expression and activity, H520 cells were incubated with nicotine
and activity of nicotinic receptors in SCC H520 cells was
measured by whole-cell voltage clamp. As shown in Fig. 4A,
incubation in 2 Amol/L nicotine for 48 h up-regulated nAChR
expression as shown by immunostaining. As shown in Fig. 4B, the
nAChRs expressed in SCC are active with both a7 nAChR and
non–a7-containing nAChR currents. Application of 100 Amol/L
nicotine to a H520 cell voltage clamped at 60 mV elicited a
transient inward current (Fig. 4B), and mean peak nicotineinduced inward current (Inic) was 120.4 F 11.5 pA (n = 9).
Desensitization time constant for Inic was 8.9 F 3.9 s (n = 5). The
EC50 for receptor activation by nicotine was 57 Amol/L, and the
Hill coefficient was 1.1 (data not shown). Currents induced by
100 Amol/L nicotine were reversibly suppressed by 30 Amol/L
mecamylamine, a nonselective nAChR antagonist, and by 20
nmol/L methyllycaconitine (MLA), a specific a7-specific nAChR
antagonist (Fig. 4B). Nicotine-induced inward current was reduced
85 F 5% (n = 4) by mecamylamine and 76 F 7.6% (n = 4) by MLA.

content of normal lung and SCC tumors. ACh content of tumors expressed as
pmol/g wet weight. ACh content of tumors was significantly higher than normal
lung (note data plotted on log scale). B, nicotine increased ACh secretion by
H520 SCC cells in culture. H520 cells (0.5 million) were plated in 24-well plates
and incubated overnight. On the second day, fresh medium containing 50 Amol/L
neostigmine and nicotine at the concentrations shown was added. After an
additional 24 or 48 h of incubation, ACh content in the medium was measured.
Columns, mean of four experiments; bars, SD. *, P < 0.02, compared with
control.

These studies show that H520 cells express both functional a7
nAChR and non–a7-containing nAChR. Recording from single
cells showed that chronic exposure to nicotine resulted in
increased activity of the nAChR expressed in the cultured SCC
cells (Fig. 4C and D). Thus, chronic nicotine exposure both upregulates and activates nAChR expression in SCC.
We have previously reported that M3 muscarinic antagonists
can block SCLC growth by targeting MAPK proliferative pathways, which are activated by both nicotinic and muscarinic
cholinergic receptors. Given that SCC express similar nAChR and
mAChR as SCLC, this suggests that M3 antagonists might
similarly inhibit proliferation in SCC. H520 cells express
functional mAChR as shown by the ability of atropine to block
the ACh-induced increase in intracellular calcium (Fig. 5A). As
shown in Fig. 5B, the selective M3 mAChR antagonist darifenacin
blocked the nicotine-induced increase in H520 cell proliferation
in vitro. Darifenacin also significantly inhibited growth of H520
SCC xenografts in nude mice (Fig. 5C and D). This suggests that

Cholinergic Signaling in Squamous Cell Lung Carcinoma

SCC tumor growth can be blocked by targeting the activated
cholinergic pathways present in SCC.

Discussion
Lung cancer expresses an intrinsic cholinergic signaling system
such that exogenous nicotine and endogenous ACh can stimulate
tumor growth. As we show here, the cholinergic system in SCC is
up-regulated at multiple levels. This up-regulation combined with
smoking by most lung cancer patients provides not only a
considerable proliferative stimuli but also a pathway to target for
new therapeutic approaches to lung cancer.
In early studies, Schuller (28) showed that nicotine stimulated
growth of lung cancer cell lines and Maneckjee and Minna (29)
showed that nicotine blocked the inhibitory effect of opiates on lung
cancer cell line growth. Subsequent studies have shown that nicotine
acting through nAChR activates lung cancer growth through both
the Akt and MAPK pathways (4–9). Similarly, ACh acting through
mAChR as well as nAChR has been shown to lead to cell proliferation
by activation of MAPK [extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2
(ERK1/2)] and stimulation of cell cycle progression (17, 18, 30).
Studies from our laboratory showed that lung cancers express
nAChR and mAChR as part of a stimulatory autocrine cholinergic
pathway and that, in addition to cholinergic receptors, lung cancers
synthesize and secrete ACh and express cholinesterases (11).

SCCs are derived from bronchial epithelial cells. Thus, not
surprisingly, normal bronchial epithelial cells also express a
cholinergic autocrine loop (13). However, as shown in Figs. 1–3,
cholinergic signaling is markedly up-regulated in SCC compared
with normal lung. As shown in Fig. 1A, ChAT is strongly upregulated in SCC, whereas cholinesterases are down-regulated. This
combination of increased synthesis and decreased degradation
causes dramatic increases in ACh content of tumor compared with
normal lung as shown in Fig. 3A. Thus, SCCs secrete increased
levels of ACh to provide an endogenous proliferative stimuli to
both mAChR and nAChR. The mechanism underlying the increased
ChAT expression in SCC is not clear, although nicotine itself
stimulates ACh secretion from H520 cells in culture (Fig. 3B). The
observation of decreased cholinesterases in SCC is consistent with
the results of Martinez-Moreno and colleagues (31) who reported
decreases in AChE and BChE activity in both SCC and large cell
carcinoma of the lung. The potential importance of decreased
cholinesterase in tumor growth is further supported by Cabello and
colleagues (32) who showed that long-term treatment of rats with
cholinesterase inhibitors led to increased formation of mammary
carcinomas that could be blocked by administration of the
muscarinic antagonist atropine.
There is also a striking reduction in the levels of Lynx1 in SCC
(Fig. 1A). Lynx1 is a member of a newly described family of
allosteric modulators of nicotinic receptor activity (33–35). Lynx1

has been shown to attenuate responses to ACh and to increase the
extent to which ACh and nicotine desensitize nAChR (33). In brain,
Lynx1 knockout mice show dramatically increased responses to
nicotine (36). Our laboratory has recently shown that Lynx1,
the nAChR accessory protein, is expressed in normal bronchial
epithelium (25). We now find that Lynx1 is widely expressed in SCC
but is expressed at significantly lower levels in tumors than
adjacent normal tissue. Thus, decreases in Lynx1 would be
expected to potentiate SCC responses to exogenous nicotine and
endogenous ACh.
As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, nicotinic receptors are expressed in
the majority of SCC consistent with their expression in normal
bronchial epithelium (25). Consistent with West and colleagues (4),
nAChR subunits, including a3, a5, a7, a9, and h2, were found in
most SCC (Figs. 1 and 2). M2, M3, and M4 mAChR subtypes were
also found to be expressed in SCC (Figs. 1 and 2). These results
imply that SCC might have homomeric nAChR containing a7 or a9
subunits and heteromeric forms containing both a and h subunits.
We did not check for a10, but given its wide expression in
peripheral tissue, it is also likely present in SCC and could form
heteromers with a9 (37). There were no significant differences in
levels of a3, a7, a9, and h2 nAChR subunits and M3 and M4
mAChR receptor between SCC and the adjacent normal tissues but
levels of a5 and h3 nAChR subunits were significantly higher in
tumor than normal tissues. The presence of increased levels of
a5 and h3 subunits would suggest that growth of some SCC might
be sensitive to mecamylamine, which is an inhibitor of heteromeric
nAChR subtypes. Consistent with this, Zhu and colleagues (38)
have shown that mecamylamine inhibits secondhand smoke
stimulation of Lewis lung cancer cells in nude mice and we have

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (12). June 15, 2008

previously shown that mecamylamine inhibits growth of SCLC cells
in vitro (11). Interestingly, levels of M2 receptors were decreased
and we have previously reported that M2 activation seems to
inhibit lung cancer growth (39).
Lam and colleagues (10) recently examined expression of nAChR
in a series of NSCLC. Interestingly, they did not see the increase
in a5 and h3 we observed but instead saw a small decrease in a4
and h4, which we did not observe. However, their series was
primarily adenocarcinomas with only 6 of 66 being SCC. In their
individual results, levels of a4 and h4 did in fact seem higher in
SCC than adenocarcinomas. Differences in receptor expression
between lung adenocarcinomas and SCCs are to be expected
because they derive from different lung cell types that also have
different patterns of receptor expression. These differences show
how important it is to fully characterize the different nAChR
receptor expression by different lung cancer types as this may
affect responses to therapy. Lam and colleagues (10) also reported
a striking difference in nAChR receptor expression between
adenocarcinomas from smokers and nonsmokers. SCC in never
smokers is less common than adenocarcinoma in never smokers
(3), so, not surprisingly, none of the SCC in the series we studied
came from nonsmokers so we could not examine effects of
smoking on receptor expression. In addition, we did not have
pack-year histories or gender identification associated with the
tumors. It is quite possible that the number of pack-years of
exposure to exogenous nicotine might affect nAChR receptor
expression patterns by the tumors. The role of gender on
cholinergic expression patterns is also of great interest given the
significantly higher frequency of lung adenocarcinomas in never
smoker women than never smoker men (40).

Cholinergic Signaling in Squamous Cell Lung Carcinoma

What makes the expression of nAChR in lung cancer so
significant is that the majority of patients are smokers and many
continue to smoke even after diagnosis. Thus, the nAChR in lung
cancers are continually exposed to nicotine. The effect of nicotine
on nicotinic receptor activity is highly complex and has been
extensively studied in brain. In some neurons, chronic nicotine
exposure can up-regulate and inactivate nAChR (41); in other
systems, chronic nicotine up-regulates and activates nAChR (42).
Nicotine has also been recently shown to act as a chaperone and
increase targeting of mature nAChR to the cell membrane (43).
As shown in Fig. 4A, nicotine increased expression of nAChR in
H520 SCC cells. This is consistent with the finding of Lam and
colleagues (10) and consistent with our previous finding that
chronic nicotine increases nAChR expression in normal lung cells
(15). Importantly, the up-regulation of nAChR expression is
associated with increased receptor activity as shown by whole-cell
voltage clamp recordings (Fig. 4). Antagonist studies show activity
of both homomeric a7 nAChR and non–a7-containing heteromeric nAChR (Fig. 4B).
In comparing levels of expression of components of the
cholinergic signaling pathway between the normal and neoplastic
lung samples, it is striking that all the significant changes were in
the direction of increased cholinergic signaling in the tumors. First,
levels of ACh increased in tumors reflecting increased ChAT and
decreased cholinesterase expression. The increased levels of tumor
ACh would then be able to stimulate proliferative pathways
through both muscarinic and nicotinic mechanisms. Cholinergic
stimulation of growth would likely be increased as levels of some
nAChR subunits are increased, and levels of inhibitory M2
muscarinic receptors are decreased. Nicotinic receptors would
also likely show less desensitization from endogenous ACh and
exogenous nicotine as levels of Lynx1 are decreased. Finally, we
have shown that nicotine up-regulates nAChR activity, so smoking
will amplify responses to the increased levels of ACh found in lung
cancers as well as amplify responses to continued smoking. Thus,
the changes seen in cholinergic signaling in SCC strongly support a
role for nicotine to stimulate growth and progression of the
tumors. Consistent with this, continued smoking has been shown
to have a negative correlation on lung cancer survival (44–46).
Therefore, in smokers with lung cancer, tumors would be
stimulated both by endogenous ACh and exogenous nicotine. Each
by itself is capable of stimulating proliferation of tumor cells and
the combination of both has the potential to provide an additive
stimuli to proliferation.
The mechanisms underlying the differences in cholinergic
expression between tumors and normal lung remain to be
determined and require further studies. The differences may derive
from the cells of origin of SCC in that expression of nAChR,
mAChR, and ChAT is normally greater in bronchial epithelium
than lung parenchyma. Alternately, differences may reflect the
effects of nicotine-stimulating cholinergic expression in the tumor,
reflect increased proliferation by the tumor, or reflect other
changes related to tumorigenesis. Finally, it is possible that the
differences could reflect sampling differences between normal and
tumor tissue in which the normal samples do not represent a good
sampling of normal large airway epithelium.
The up-regulation of cholinergic signaling in SCC suggests that
this pathway can be targeted for therapeutic intervention. A model
of the cholinergic pathway is shown in Fig. 6, and as can be seen,
there are multiple potential targets. West and colleagues (4) have
shown that Akt pathway can be effectively used to block nicotine-

www.aacrjournals.org

associated proliferation, and Trombino and colleagues (47) have
shown that nAChR antagonists can inhibit growth of mesotheliomas. We have chosen to focus on the muscarinic receptor as a
potential target because oral muscarinic antagonists are well
tolerated and in wide clinical use for overactive bladder (48) and
inhaled muscarinic antagonists are widely used for chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (49). We have previously reported
that M3 muscarinic antagonists can block growth of SCLC cell lines
in vitro and in nude mice xenografts by preventing ACh- and
nicotine-induced increases in MAPK phosphorylation as well as
lowering basal levels of MAPK phosphorylation. Because of the
inhibitory effects of M3 antagonists on SCLC proliferation, we
investigated their effects on proliferation of SCC.
As shown in Fig. 5A, the H520 line expresses muscarinic
receptors as shown by the ability of the nonselective muscarinic
antagonist atropine to block the ACh-induced increase in
intracellular calcium. M3-selective antagonists similarly blocked
the ACh-induced increase in intracellular calcium (data not
shown). The M3-selective mAChR antagonist darifenacin also
blocked the proliferative effect of nicotine on H520 cells (Fig. 5B).
This is consistent with our prior report that darifenacin blocks
both basal and ACh-induced phosphorylation of MAPK (pERK1/2;
ref. 22), and as shown in Fig. 6, MAPK activation represents an
intersection of both nAChR and mAChR activation. Finally, as
shown in Fig. 5C and D, darifenacin also significantly inhibited
growth of SCC cells both in vitro and in nude mice. This suggests
that M3-selective antagonists may have clinical utility to slow the

Figure 6. Model of cholinergic signaling in SCC. Exogenous nicotine activates
MAPK and Akt proliferative pathways through nicotinic cholinergic receptors.
Endogenous ACh similarly activates both MAPK and Akt pathways through both
muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. Thus, muscarinic antagonists have potential
to block proliferation induced both by exogenous nicotine and endogenous ACh
as well as antagonizing the up-regulation in cholinergic signaling induced by
nicotine.

growth and progression of SCC by blocking the proliferative stimuli
caused by endogenous and exogenous cholinergic stimulation.
Given their widespread clinical use, it may be possible to derive
epidemiologic data on lung cancer survival from individuals
treated long term with M3 antagonists, although such studies
have yet to be reported.
