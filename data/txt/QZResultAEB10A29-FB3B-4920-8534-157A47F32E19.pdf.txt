ABSTRACT
Cyclin E/Cdk2 kinase activity is frequently deregulated in human cancers,
resulting in impaired apoptosis. Here, we show that cyclin E/Cdk2 phosphorylates
and stabilizes the pro-survival Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1, a key cell death resistance
determinant to the small molecule Bcl-2 family inhibitors ABT-199 and ABT-737,
mimetics of the Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3). Cyclin E levels were elevated and
there was increased association of cyclin E/Cdk2 with Mcl-1 in ABT-737-resistant
compared to parental cells. Cyclin E depletion in various human tumor cell-lines and
cyclin E-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts showed decreased levels of Mcl-1 protein, with
no change in Mcl-1 mRNA levels. In the absence of cyclin E, Mcl-1 ubiquitination was
enhanced, leading to decreased protein stability. Studies with Mcl-1 phosphorylation
mutants show that cyclin E/Cdk2-dependent phosphorylation of Mcl-1 residues on its
PEST domain resulted in increased Mcl-1 stability (Thr92, and Thr163) and Bim binding
(Ser64). Cyclin E knock-down restored ABT-737 sensitivity to acquired and inherently
resistant Mcl-1-dependent tumor cells. CDK inhibition by dinaciclib resulted in Bim
release from Mcl-1 in ABT-737-resistant cells. Dinaciclib in combination with ABT-737
and ABT-199 resulted in robust synergistic cell death in leukemic cells and primary
chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient samples. Collectively, our findings identify a
novel mechanism of cyclin E-mediated Mcl-1 regulation that provides a rationale for
clinical use of Bcl-2 family and Cdk inhibitors for Mcl-1-dependent tumors.

INTRODUCTION

Bcl-xL [1] and deregulation of the cell cycle machinery
due to increased cyclin E activity [2-4]. Cyclin E/cyclindependent kinase (Cdk) 2 plays a crucial role in signaling
cascades that govern phosphorylation of a wide range
of substrates. These include E2F, Rb, nucleophosmin,
and NPAT (nuclear protein, ataxia-telangiectasia), which
contain a Cdk2-binding motif and are involved in both
physiological and pathological cellular processes [3, 5].

The balance between cell proliferation and death
is vital for normal growth, differentiation, and tissue
homeostasis. Deregulation of proteins involved in these
processes drive tumor progression and contributes to
malignant phenotype. Tumorigenesis primarily involves
overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1, Bcl-2, and

Oncogenic signaling by cyclin E gives rise to malignant
phenotypes characterized by genomic instability, impaired
apoptosis, and drug resistance, as observed in breast,
ovarian, lung, and hematologic malignancies [5].
Mcl-1 is a labile pro-survival Bcl-2 family member
that has variable expression levels during the cell cycle,
suggesting that cell cycle regulatory proteins modulate
Mcl-1 protein levels [6, 7]. Mcl-1 plays a prominent role in
evading mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization
by sequestering Bcl-2-homology domain 3 (BH3)-only
proteins in response to various apoptotic stimuli. Mcl-1 is
also involved in critical physiological processes, such as
mitochondrial homeostasis, apoptosis, autophagy and cell
cycle regulation, as well as maintenance and development
of hematopoetic stem cells [8]. Post-translational
modifications of Mcl-1, primarily by phosphorylation,
have a significant contribution to the control of Mcl-1
expression that determines cellular state as well as cellular
fate. The N-terminal proline, glutamic acid, serine and
threonine regions (PEST) domain of Mcl-1 encompass
170 residues that are unique among Bcl-2 family
members. They contain putative regulatory residues and
motifs responsible for Mcl-1 phosphorylation, proteolytic
cleavage, and ubiquitination [1, 8]. Phosphorylation of
Mcl-1 at Thr92, Ser121, and Thr163 residues, which is
primarily mediated by ERK-1/JNK/p38, results in Mcl-1
stabilization [9, 10]. Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) destabilizes Mcl-1 by phosphorylating Ser155 and
Ser159 [11, 12]. However, this process requires a priming
kinase, ERK/JNK, to phosphorylate Mcl-1 Thr163 [8].
Cell-cycle-associated phosphorylation of Mcl-1 by Cdk1/
Cdk2 facilitates Bim sequestration [7] or degradation
during mitosis [6, 13]. Although regulation of Mcl-1
during mitosis has been reported [14], the role of enhanced
cyclin E/Cdk2 activity in impaired apoptosis and drug
resistance has not been defined.
ABT-737/ABT-263 (navitoclax) and ABT-199
(venetoclax) are small molecules that inhibit Bcl-2 family
proteins by binding to two hydrophobic pockets formed
by the BH3 domain contained in all Bcl-2 family members
[15]. ABT-199 has shown dramatic clinical activity in
Bcl-2-dependent hematologic malignancies, most notably
in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell
lymphoma [16]. We have previously reported that Mcl-1
levels determine sensitivity to both ABT-737 and ABT199 in acquired and inherently resistant leukemic cells
[17, 18]. Mcl-1 anti-apoptotic function in ABT-737resistant (ABT-R) cells is enhanced by phosphorylation
on its Thr163 and Ser64 residues, which increases Mcl1 stability and Bim sequestration, respectively [17].
In this study, we show that both cyclin E and Mcl-1
expression are increased in ABT-R cells. We define Mcl-1
as a substrate of cyclin E/Cdk2 that is phosphorylated at
Ser64, Thr92, and Thr163, modifications that are critical
for Mcl-1 stability and function. Targeting cyclin E using
Cdk inhibition, alone or in combination with the BH3

mimetics ABT-737 or ABT-199 substantially reduces
survival of Mcl-1-dependent tumor cells. Our data reveal a
novel functional role of cyclin E/Cdk2 in Mcl-1 regulation
and provide strategies to overcome Mcl-1-mediated drug
resistance in lymphoid malignancies as well as solid
tumors.

RESULTS
Cyclin E regulates Mcl-1 protein levels
In cells that developed resistance to the Bcl-2
inhibitor ABT-737, phosphorylation of Mcl-1 on Thr163
and Ser64 increased its stability and Bim sequestration
[17]. Immunoblot analyses indicate that in addition
to Mcl-1, cyclin E levels were also higher in ABT-R
compared to parental cells. There was no change in Cdk2
and cyclin A, while cyclin B1 levels were decreased
(Figure 1A). To investigate how cyclin E affects Mcl-1
expression, cyclin E levels were down-regulated in PC3,
H1299, HEK293T, and Reh ABT-R cells by siRNAmediated knockdown. Mcl-1 levels were diminished
significantly upon knockdown of cyclin E, but not cyclin
A. Cyclin E knockdown had no effect on the levels
of Cdk2, cyclin A, cyclin B1, and pro-survival Bcl-2
proteins (Figure 1B and 1C). In siCyclin E-expressing
cells there was no change in Mcl-1 mRNA levels (Figure
1D). Moreover, no significant differences in the cell cycle
profile were observed in ABT-R compared to parental
cells or after cyclin E knockdown in PC3 and H1299 cells
(Supplementary Figure S1A and S1B). To conclusively
demonstrate that cyclin E regulates Mcl-1 expression, we
investigated Mcl-1 levels in cyclin E-/- mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (MEFs) [19]. There was a two-fold decrease
in Mcl-1 protein expression in cyclin E-/- compared to
wild type (WT) MEFs, with minimal reduction in Mcl-1
mRNA levels (Figure 1E, 1F, and 1G). Reconstitution of
cyclin E expression in cyclin E-/- MEFs with HA-cyclin
E confirmed that Myc-Mcl-1 levels were higher in the
presence of constitutively active cyclin E (Figure 1H).
Importantly, HA-cyclin E also rescued endogenous Mcl-1
levels that were initially decreased after downregulating
cyclin E (Figure 1I). These results suggest that cyclin E
regulates Mcl-1 protein predominantly at post-translational
level.

Cyclin E/Cdk2 associates with and stabilizes Mcl1 protein
To define the mechanism responsible for cyclin
E-mediated Mcl-1 regulation, we examined the
interaction of Mcl-1 with cyclin E and its consequence
on Mcl-1 stability. Mcl-1 was immunoprecipitated from
parental and ABT-R Reh cells. Immunoblotting analyses

with Mcl-1 in ABT-R compared to parental cells (Figure
2A). This association was confirmed by reciprocal
immunoprecipitation with cyclin E and immunoblotting
for Mcl-1 (Figure 2B). There was no association of cyclin
E with the pro-survival protein Bcl-2 in Reh parental

and ABT-R cells (Supplementary Figure S2). Similar
interactions between Mcl-1 and Cyclin E were detected in
HEK293T and H1299 epithelial tumor cells (Figure 2C).
Mcl-1 is a labile protein that has a short half-life
[1, 8]. In order to understand the functional importance
of its association with cyclin E/Cdk2, we determined the

cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor. Mcl-1 halflife was substantially decreased in siCyclin E-expressing
H1299, PC3 and in cyclin E-/- MEFs (Figure 2D-2F).

These findings indicate that the cyclin E/Cdk2 complex
increases Mcl-1 stability, as indicated by its decreased
protein turnover.

Cyclin E/Cdk2 mediates Mcl-1 phosphorylation
and Bim sequestration

for cyclin E/Cdk2-dependent phosphorylation. There
was no significant change in expression levels of Mcl-1
phosphomimetic mutants in WT MEFs (Supplementary
Figure S4A) with the exception of Mcl-1 T92E/T163E.
Thr92 and Thr163 phosphorylation enhance Mcl-1
stability [8]; hence the observed elevated Mcl-1 T92E/
T163E levels were expected. There was no change in
expression levels of Mcl-1 alanine mutants in WT and
cyclin E-/- MEFs (Supplementary Figure S4B-S4C). In
order to understand the direct impact of cyclin E/Cdk2mediated phosphorylation on Mcl-1 stability, we expressed
Myc-Mcl-1, alone and together with HA-cyclin E, in WT
and cyclin E-/- MEFs. Importantly, the Mcl-1 half-life was
substantially decreased in cyclin E-/- compared to WT
MEFs and then increased substantially when HA-cyclin
E was co-expressed (Figure 4A, 4B, and 4E). Subsequent
half-life studies with Myc-Mcl-1 mutants revealed that
phosphorylation at Thr92 and Thr163, but not Ser64 or
Ser121, increased Mcl-1 level and half-life as compared
to the WT-Mcl-1 construct in cyclin E-/- MEFs (Figure 4C4G). Mcl-1 half-life with Myc-Mcl-1 T92A, T163A and
T92A/T163A was comparable with WT-Mcl-1 in cyclin
E-/- MEFs (Figure 4H, 4I). These data suggest that cyclin
E/Cdk2 stabilizes Mcl-1 by phosphorylating Thr92 and
Thr163.
We reported that ABT-R cells have increased
Mcl-1:Bim interaction when Mcl-1 is phosphorylated
on Ser64 [17]. To conclusively determine whether the
cyclin E/Cdk2-dependent phosphorylation sites on Mcl1 affect its interaction with Bim, endogenous Bim was

The Mcl-1 N-terminal domain contains putative
regulatory motifs that are rich in PEST residues, and is
predicted to have a low structural complexity [8]. To
determine how cyclin E/Cdk2 phosphorylated Mcl-1 to
enhance its stability and function, we defined the sequence
S/TPXX as the Mcl-1 motif that is phosphorylated by
cyclin E/Cdk2 (Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure
S3A). This sequence is similar to X-1(S/T0)P+1X+2(K/
R+3) that is present in known Cdk2 substrates [20].
Substrate affinity studies show that short synthetic
peptides containing such sequences act as efficient
substrates for cyclin-Cdk complexes [20]. Structural
modeling of selected S/TPXX sequences within the Mcl-1
PEST domain supports the notion that these sites can be
phosphorylated by cyclin E/Cdk2 (Supplementary Figure
S3B-S3I).
To directly test the role of cyclin E/Cdk2-dependent
phosphorylation of Mcl-1, we generated phosphomimetic
and alanine mutants at sites within the PEST domain
(Ser64, Thr92, Ser121, and Thr163) that matched the
putative Cdk2 phosphorylation motif. Myc-tagged Mcl-1S64E, T92E, and T163E proteins exhibited higher steadystate levels than WT-Mcl-1 when expressed in cyclin
E-/- MEFs, while the Mcl-1 S121E expression level was
lower (Figure 3B). These results indicate that the 64SPPS67,
92
TPAR95, and 163TPPP166 Mcl-1 motifs are substrates

immunoprecipitated from cyclin E-/- MEFs transfected with
Myc-tagged WT or the S4E T92E, T163E or S64A Mcl1 mutants. Immunoblot analyses indicated an increased
association of Bim with S64E Mcl-1 as compared to WT,
T92E and T163E Mcl-1 (Figure 4J). Interestingly, Mcl1:Bim association was completely abolished when Mcl1-S64A construct was used as compared to Mcl-1 WT

and S64E (Figure 4K). This finding suggests that cyclin
E/Cdk2-mediated phosphorylation on Ser64 enhances the
anti-apoptotic function of Mcl-1 by Bim sequestration.
These results indicate that Mcl-1 phosphorylation,
mediated by cyclin E/Cdk2, enhances Mcl-1 stability and
function.

analyses with Annexin V-PI and flow cytometry (Figure
7A and 7B). These findings indicate that inhibiting
cyclin E/Cdk2 activity enhances the sensitivity of Mcl-1dependent tumors to BH3 mimetics.

DISCUSSION
Mcl-1 plays a pivotal role in evading cell death in
response to various apoptotic stimuli in solid tumors and
hematologic malignancies [8]. Cancer cells modulate Mcl1 by exploiting a number of redundant pathways regulating
at transcriptional, translational, and post-translational
levels. Regulation of Mcl-1 at post-translational level
is primarily mediated by phosphorylation by Cdk1,
Cdk2, JNK, ERK, and GSK-3β [1]. Upstream signaling
pathways regulate these kinases that phosphorylate the
Mcl-1 PEST domain, which plays a decisive role in Mcl-1
stability [23, 24] and binding of BH3-only proteins [7].
Based on the experimental evidence presented here and
our previous findings [17], we propose a mechanism for
cyclin E/Cdk2-dependent Mcl-1 regulation in mediating
chemoresistance to Bcl-2 inhibitors. We define cyclin E,
but not cyclin A, as a regulatory partner for Cdk2 activity
that stabilizes Mcl-1 and determines the response to BH3
mimetics (Figure 7C). We found that in the absence of
cyclin E in ABT-737 resistant cells, Mcl-1 protein levels
were substantially reduced, with no effect on Mcl-1
mRNA. Previous studies have shown that Mcl-1 levels
are a critical resistance determinant to ABT-737 and
ABT-199 treatment [17, 18, 25]. Mcl-1 stability, that was
enhanced in acquired and inherent ABT-737/199 resistant,
as compared to sensitive cells [17, 18], was prevented in
the absence of cyclin E. Post-translational modification on
Mcl-1 N-terminal region determine its stability [26]. We
show that the Mcl-1 N-terminal region has Cdk2-specific
phosphorylation motifs at Ser64, Ser121, Thr92, and
Thr163 residues. Except Ser121, levels of mutant Mcl-1
with phosphomimetic changes at Ser64, Thr92, and Thr163
were higher than WT Mcl-1. As expected, conversion of
Thr92, Thr163, and Ser64 to alanine decreased Mcl-1
stability and ability to sequester Bim. Consistent with our
results, it has been reported that Ser121 phosphorylation
did not have any effect on Mcl-1 stability [27] and hence
did not increase its protein levels. We show that cyclin E/
Cdk2-mediated phosphorylation at: (i) Thr92 and Thr163
increased Mcl-1 stability and (ii) Ser64 increased Mcl1’s ability to sequester Bim. Our results regarding the
function of these residues on Mcl-1 are consistent with
previous reports [7, 8, 23, 24]. Mcl-1 levels predict the
response to anti-tubulin chemotherapeutics and ABT-737
in patients harboring loss-of-function in the FBW7 (F-box
and WD repeat domain containing 7) tumor suppressor
gene [13, 28, 29]. Interestingly, cyclin E is also a target
of FBW7 [30] and FBW7 mutations deregulate cyclin E
and Mcl-1 levels in primary tumors [31]. We show that
Mcl-1 phosphorylation by cyclin E/Cdk2 is critical for

BH3 mimetics in combination with Cdk
inhibitors overcome cyclin E/Cdk2-mediated
chemoresistance
As many tumors depend on Mcl-1 for
chemoresistance [1, 21, 22], we investigated whether
targeting cyclin E/Cdk2 could sensitize cancer cells to
BH3 mimetics. Mcl-1 levels were decreased in PC3 and
H1299 cells following cyclin E knockdown. Caspase-3
was proteolytically cleaved following ABT-737 treatment
only in PC3 and H1299 cells with reduced cyclin E levels
thus overcoming Mcl-1 mediated ABT-737 resistance
(Figure 6A). In Reh ABT-R cells Mcl-1 levels were
down-regulated after cyclin E depletion and caspase-3
was cleaved. However, there was no additional increase
in caspase-3 cleavage with ABT-737 treatment (Figure
6A). Further extending this approach to targeting Cdks
pharmacologically with the small-molecule inhibitor
dinaciclib (SCH727965; 10 nM) resulted in reduced cyclin
E and cyclin A levels, PARP cleavage, and decrease in
metabolic activity (Figure 6B and 6H). No changes were
seen in mRNA levels of Mcl-1 and Bim (Figure 6C and
6D). There was no change in expression levels of Mcl-1
and other Bcl-2 family proteins at lower concentrations
of dinaciclib. To study the effect of dinaciclib on Mcl1:Bim interaction, Mcl-1 was immunoprecipitated in
parental and resistant Reh cells following dinaciclib
treatment. Immunoblotting analyses with Bim indicate
that there was higher Mcl-1:Bim association in Reh
ABT-R compared to parental cells that was disrupted
following dinaciclib treatment (Figure 6E). This result was
confirmed by reciprocal immunoprecipitation with Bim
and immunoblotting for Mcl-1 after dinaciclib treatment
(Figure 6F).
Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) DOHH2
and SU-DHL-16 cells, which have high Mcl-1 protein
levels and are resistant to ABT-199 [18], showed high
sensitivity to dinaciclib + ABT-199 (Figure 6G, 6H), a
combination that was highly synergistic (CI<0.2) (Figure
6J). DLBCL OCL-LY-19 cells with low Mcl-1 levels that
are sensitive to ABT-199 [18] showed similar synergism
to the combination of these two agents (Figure 6J). There
was no additional cell death with the dinaciclib + ABT-737
combination as compared with dinaciclib alone treatment
in Reh ABT-R (Figure 6I). Importantly, primary patientderived CLL cells showed high sensitivity to dinaciclib
+ ABT-737 or ABT-199, as indicated by cell viability

diminished Mcl-1 ubiquitination, thereby preventing cell
death.
Targeting Mcl-1 by induction of the BH3-only
protein Noxa [17] or by inhibiting MEK [32] or PI3K
[18, 33] pathway can accelerate ABT-737- and ABT199-mediated cell death. As these Bcl-2 inhibitors do not
target Mcl-1, it limits their applicability to solid tumors
where Mcl-1 is abundant [21, 22]. Based on our findings,
Mcl-1 protein levels were decreased following cyclin E
depletion. ABT-737 treatment in solid tumors depleted
of cyclin E resulted in proteolytic clevage of caspase-3.
However, in acquired ABT-R cells depleted of cyclin E

there was no further activation of caspase-3 following
ABT-737 treatment. This is expected, as ABT-R cells are
Mcl-1 dependent and therefore Bim is sequestered by Mcl1 and not Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL [17]. Since ABT-737 is a Bcl-2
and Bcl-xL specific BH3 mimetic, it does not target Mcl1 to have any additional effect in cyclin E-depleted Reh
ABT-R cells. ABT-737 treatment in ABT-R cells triggers
activation of MAPK/ERK pathways that have been shown
to phosphorylate Mcl-1 at Thr163 residue [9] and it plays
additional role in Mcl-1 stability [17]. Nevertheless, since
Mcl-1 levels were down-regulated following cyclin E
depletion that resulted in caspase-3 cleavage, it suggests

B. ABT-199 (10 nM) alone or in combination with dinaciclib (10 nM). Cell viability was determined by Annexin V-PI staining, represented

Schematic illustration of the role of Cyclin E/Cdk2 in Mcl-1 protein regulation. Inhibition of cyclin E/Cdk2 destabilizes Mcl-1 by inhibiting
its phosphorylation on Ser64, Thr92, and Thr163 residues resulting in: (i) Mcl-1 ubiquitination and degradation and (ii) Bim release from
the Mcl-1-Bim complex, causing Bax activation and cell death.

cyclin E/Cdk2-mediated regulation of Mcl-1 in ABT-R
cells.
Since therapeutic strategies that utilize Mcl-1specific inhibitors have so far been ineffective and that
Mcl-1 deletion may have serious side effects [26, 34, 35],
there is a need for novel ways to target Mcl-1 regulation
to overcome its role in chemoresistance [1]. Aberrant
activation of CDKs leads to cell-cycle dysregulation,
which is a hallmark of all human cancer. CDK inhibition
for targeting cancer has shown therapeutic potential
and subsequently many pan-CDK inhibitors have been
considered for clinical development. However, their
non-specific activity has caused undesirable effects and
hindered their further development [36]. Dinaciclib, a
potent selective multi-CDK inhibitor (Cdk1, Cdk2, Cdk5,
and Cdk9) is under clinical development [36-38]. As
compared to previous CDK inhibitors such as flavopiridol,
it has shown reduced toxicity and enhanced clinical
efficiency in patients with CLL, multiple myeloma,
and solid tumors [36, 39, 40]. Higher concentrations of
dinaciclib were shown to down-regulate Mcl-1 levels
by targeting its transcriptional control by Cdk9 [41].
Our results show that dinaciclib at a concentration of 10
nM, when combined with ABT-199 or ABT-737, shows
potent synergistic cell death in leukemic cell lines and
primary CLL patient samples. Low concentration of
dinaciclib would be desirable and achievable in certain
clinical settings. Dinaciclib disrupted the Mcl-1/Bim
interaction in Reh ABT-R cells with no changes in protein
and mRNA levels. This indicates that Mcl-1, which was
phosphorylated at Ser64 and Thr163 in ABT-R cells [17],
is inhibited by dinaciclib treatment, resulting in Bim
release and subsequent apoptosis.
Taken together, our findings provide a mechanism
for cyclin E/Cdk2-mediated phosphorylation of Mcl-1 as
a determinant of enhanced Mcl-1 stability and function.
Cdk inhibitors can target the increased Mcl-1 levels that
are critical for mediating chemoresistance. Our data
support a rational for using dinaciclib in combination with
venetoclax in clinical trials.

antimycotic (Gibco, Life Technologies, Gaithersburg,
MD). Reh ABT-R cell lines were generated and cultured
as described [17]. Myc-Mcl-1 was a gift from Dr. Wenyi
Wei (Harvard Medical School). HA-cyclin E was used as
described [42]. The Mcl-1 mutants were generated using
QuikChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent
Technologies). siMcl-1, siControl (Dharmacon-GE);
siCyclin A, siControl (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA) were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to manufacture’s
instructions. Reh ABT-R cells were transfected with
siControl or siMcl-1 using an Amaxa Nucleofector Kit
R (Lonza, Walkersville, MD) (program number I-009)
according to the manufacture’s protocol. ABT-737 and
ABT-199 were obtained from AbbVie (Chicago, IL, USA),
dinaciclib from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA),
and cycloheximide (20 µg/ml) from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO).

Patient samples
Peripheral blood samples from CLL patients were
obtained with the patients’ informed consent according to
protocols approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional
Review Board according to the Declaration of Helsinki.
Lymphocytes were purified by Ficoll-Paque PLUS
(GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburgh) gradient
centrifugation and used immediately [25].

Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation
Cell pellets were lysed and protein lysates
were prepared as described [17]. Proteins were
resolved on SDS-PAGE followed by transferring to
nitrocellulose membranes and incubated with primary
antibody. For ubiquitination experiments, MG132 and
N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to lysis
buffer with dithiothreitol (Sigma-Aldrich) to prepare
lysates. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described
[17]. Briefly, cells were lysed with CHAPS (Sigma)
buffer and equal amount of protein were incubated with
primary antibody overnight at 4°C. Protein A agarose
beads (Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA)
were added to all samples, followed by 1 h of incubation
at 4°C. After washing 3 times with CHAPS, the beads
were eluted with loading buffer supplemented with
2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich) and immunoblotting
was performed. Primary antibodies were for Mcl-1, Bim
(BD-Biosciences), Mcl-1 (Rockland Immunochemicals,
Gilbertsville, PA) Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, cyclin E (HE12), cyclin
E (HE111), cyclin E (M-20), cyclin B1, cyclin A (H432),
Cdk2 (M2) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA),
cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling), and β-actin (SigmaAldrich). The secondary anti-mouse and -rabbit antibodies
were purchased from Thermo-Fisher Scientific (Waltham,

GRANT SUPPORT

Cell viability and cell cycle analysis

This study was supported by the National Institutes
of Health (NCI) grant CA127264 to A. Almasan.

Cell viability was determined as described
[17] using fluorescein-conjugated Annexin V-PI (BD
Biosciences) on a BD FACS Calibur flow cytometer. In
order to measure cell viability, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H
tetrazolium inner salt (MTS) assay (Promega, Madison,
WI, USA) was used and percentage reduction in metabolic
activity was calculated as described [43]. For cell cycle
analysis, cells were fixed with 70% ethanol and incubated
on ice for 15 min. The cells were then stained with solution
containing propidium iodide (PI) (50 µg/ml), RNase A (0.1
mg/ml), Triton X (0.05%) for 40 min at 37°C. Following
incubation, 500 µl of PBS was added to each sample and
cells were analyzed on a BD FACS Calibur flow cytometer
(Beckton Dickinson, Mansfield, MA). The data for cell
viability and cell cycle were processed using the CellQuest
Version 5.2.1 software. The results were normalized to
survival of vehicle control cells treated with ethanol or
DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich).
