Abstract
Author Manuscript

Activation of a cellular stress response and the transcription factor XBP1 in dendritic cells has
now been shown to limit the cells' ability to stimulate antitumour immune responses in a mouse
model of ovarian cancer.

Author Manuscript

Cells in the microenvironment of a tumour are exposed to stressful events. This is due in
part to a lack of oxygen and nutrients that leads to malfunction of the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER), the cellular organelle responsible for protein folding. The result is an accumulation of
unfolded proteins — a state referred to as ER stress. Cancer cells use a signalling pathway
known as the ER stress response to survive in this environment. Whether this pathway also
affects non-cancer cells in the tumour microenvironment, which are exposed to similar
conditions, was not known. Writing in Cell, Cubillos-Ruiz et al.1 show, in a model of
ovarian cancer, that induction of the ER stress response in tumour-associated dendritic cells
disrupts the cells' ability to promote adaptive antitumour immunity.
Dendritic cells (DCs) are a type of immune cell found in all tissues. DCs are classed as
antigen-presenting cells (APCs) because they present characteristic molecular structures
(antigens) expressed by tissue cells to the immune systems T cells and so elicit tissuespecific T-cell responses2. In the tumour environment, DCs sample, process and present
tumour-cell-associated antigens and are thus potent inducers of T-cell responses that can
eliminate target tumour cells. Other APCs include tissue-resident macrophages and
circulating monocytes. Although these are less potent than DCs, they can also modulate Tcell effector responses2.

The key role of T-cell responses in cancer treatment has been firmly established in recent
years through the remarkable clinical success of strategies aimed at increasing the activation
of tumour-targeting T cells. These therapies operate through the engineering of T cells to
carry receptors that bind strongly to tumour antigens or by blocking inhibitory molecules on
T cells to increase T-cell function. However, only subsets of patients respond to these
treatments, and there is an urgent need to identify other brakes on antitumour immunity.
Although interactions between T cells and DCs typically occur in tissue-draining lymph
nodes, it is now clear that DC presentation of tumour antigens also occurs in the tumour
itself, suggesting that DCs in the tumour microenvironment can substantially influence the
functions of antitumour T cells. Thus, it is crucial to assess the characteristics of tumourassociated DCs and to identify molecules for maximizing local antigen presentation that

might also be potential drug targets. Altered DC function is common in tumours, and
different mechanisms that underlie DC dysregulation in the tumour microenvironment have
been identified, including reduced DC accumulation at the tumour site3 and increased
immuno suppression induced by soluble factors (cytokines) that are produced by tumour
cells or their surrounding tissue4.

The ER stress response is mediated by several signalling molecules, among which the
enzyme IRE 1α and its target transcription factor XBP1 are the most evolutionarily
conserved. XBP1 has been shown to promote tumour growth when expressed in cancer
cells5. Using a mouse model of ovarian cancer, Cubillos-Ruiz et al. show that damaging
molecules called reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulate in tumour-associated DCs, and
that ROS cause lipid degradation (by peroxidation) and the accumulation of lipid byproducts, which in turn leads to the ER stress response and XBP1 activation (Fig. 1).
Analysis of the genes expressed by these DCs revealed that a lipid-synthesis program is
induced in XBP1-expressing cells but not in those lacking XBP1.
The authors went on to show that deletion of the gene that encodes XBP1 in cells expressing
CD11c (an integrin protein expressed at high levels on DCs), or delivery of short inhibitory
RNA molecules that inhibit XBP1 expression, led to reduced lipid accumulation in DCs,
increased DC antigen-presentation capacity, greater accumulation of T cells in the ovarian
tumours and reduced tumour growth. Scavenger molecules that eliminate lipids and reduce
ROS levels similarly improved DC antigen-presentation ability, suggesting that XBP1's
function in enhancing tumour formation is at least partly due to the induction of lipid
biosynthesis in DCs.

Author Manuscript

Although DCs express high levels of CD11c in the steady state, other APCs such as
macrophages and monocyte-derived cells can also express CD11c (ref. 2), and so the
therapeutic benefit of XBP1 deletion in CD11c-express-ing (CD11c+) cells might not solely
reflect its effect on DCs. XBP1 has an important role in the physiology of APCs under
homeostatic conditions: deletion of XBP1 in non-tumour DCs compromises their survival6
and antigen-presentation ability7, and loss of XBP1 in activated macrophages reduces
cytokine release in response to microbial stimuli8. These findings contrast with CubillosRuiz and colleagues' demonstration that XBP1 deletion in tumour-associated CD11c+ cells
does not compromise DC survival and improves their antigen-presentation function. Such
surprising results suggest that the pro-immunogenic homeostatic function of XBP1 is
subverted in tumour-associated DCs. The extent to which the tumour or its environment
promotes XBP1 activation or subverts its function should be explored further.

Author Manuscript

Increased lipid accumulation has been observed in tumour-associated CD11c+ cells in
tumour-bearing mice and in patients with cancer9. Whether the lipid-laden CD11c+ cells
described in these studies represent bona fide DCs, monocyte-derived cells or macrophages
will need to be addressed by cell-specific assays. Lipid accumulation in macrophages has
also been linked to neurodegenerative diseases and atherosclerosis, and it will be interesting
to explore whether XBP1 contri butes to the progression of these conditions.

Cubillos-Ruiz and colleagues' results extend previous studies10,11 showing that metabolic
changes, for example increased breakdown of the amino acids arginine and tryptophan in
tumour-associated DCs, alter T-cell effector function. Greater understanding of the extent of
metabolic alterations in tumour-associated DCs should help to identify yet other pathways of
immune dysregulation in tumours. In the meantime, the authors' finding that XBP1 deletion
in DCs increases T-cell infiltration of tumours and reduces tumour growth is a timely
addition to the pressing search for target that increase antitumour T-cell function.

Figure 1. XBP1 activation inhibits presentation of tumour antigens

Antitumour immune responses rely on dendritic cells (DCs) to present molecular structures
(antigens) from tumour cells to T cells, which can then kill the antigen-bearing tumour cells.
Cubillos-Ruiz et al.1 show that damaging molecules called reactive oxygen species (ROS),
which are produced in tumour-associated DCs, induce an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress
response. The ER stress pathway leads to expression of the transcription factor XBP1, which
induces lipid synthesis. The resulting accumulation of lipids in the DCs reduces their ability
to present antigens and thus impairs antitumour T-cell responses. Macrophage cells may also
contribute to the ER stress response.
