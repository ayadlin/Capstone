ABSTRACT
Quantification of tumor necrosis in cancer patients is of diagnostic value as the
amount of necrosis is correlated with disease prognosis and it could also be used to
predict early efficacy of anti-cancer treatments. In the present study, we identified
two near infrared fluorescent (NIRF) carboxylated cyanines, HQ5 and IRDye 800CW
(800CW), which possess strong necrosis avidity. In vitro studies showed that both
dyes selectively bind to cytoplasmic proteins of dead cells that have lost membrane
integrity. Affinity for cytoplasmic proteins was confirmed using quantitative structure
activity relations modeling. In vivo results, using NIRF and optoacoustic imaging,
confirmed the necrosis avid properties of HQ5 and 800CW in a mouse 4T1 breast
cancer tumor model of spontaneous necrosis. Finally, in a mouse EL4 lymphoma tumor
model, already 24 h post chemotherapy, a significant increase in 800CW fluorescence
intensity was observed in treated compared to untreated tumors. In conclusion, we
show, for the first time, that the NIRF carboxylated cyanines HQ5 and 800CW possess
strong necrosis avid properties in vitro and in vivo. When translated to the clinic,
these dyes may be used for diagnostic or prognostic purposes and for monitoring
in vivo tumor response early after the start of treatment.

damage or sudden metabolic failure and is involved in
cancer development and treatment [1, 2]. The amount
of tissue necrosis is of diagnostic value in many cancer
types, since a high degree of necrosis is an indicator of

rapid and aggressive tumor growth and is often correlated
with poor prognosis [3–10]. Moreover, necrosis can also
be induced by injury caused to tumor tissue by anti-cancer
treatments. Finally, therapeutic approaches that initially
induce apoptotic cell death often result in secondary
necrosis, as a natural outcome of the complete apoptotic
program [11]. Accurate quantification of the amount
of tissue necrosis has great potential for pre- clinical
and clinical applications, especially in monitoring anticancer efficacy at an early stage of treatment instead of
at the end of therapy. However, the existing modalities
and methods as for example standardized uptake values
(SUVs) of FDG-PET, determination of tumor markers
or of specific tumor mRNAs all lack the accuracy for a
broad and routine application [12, 13]. Therefore, the long
lag- time in determining therapy outcome causes loss of
valuable treatment time in non-responding patients that
will receive expensive treatment and are unnecessarily
exposed to side effects. Early evaluation of the therapy
efficacy would therefore facilitate the growing call for
individualized cancer treatment, allowing the clinician to
adjust the therapy based on tumor response, resulting in
higher survival rates and cost-efficacy [1, 2].
In vitro, cell necrosis is often measured using dyes
such as Eosin, Propidium Iodide (PI), TO-PRO-3 and
Trypan Blue, which enter necrotic cells upon loss of
membrane integrity and cannot permeate living cells. PI
and the cyanine TO-PRO-3 subsequently intercalate into
DNA [14–16] rendering them potentially mutagenic, which
has hampered their clinical use. Perfetto et al. showed
that amine-reactive cyanines could also be employed
to discriminate between living and dead cells in vitro
[17, 18]. The amine-reactive group on such cyanines
can covalently interact with free amino moieties that are
available on every protein. Because these amine-reactive
compounds are incapable of passing intact cell membranes,
only extracellular membrane proteins of living cells are
labeled. However, as soon as cells lose their membrane
integrity, cytoplasmic proteins become available for dye
binding, leading to an accumulation of these agents in dead
cells. Though, this principle cannot be employed in vivo,
as immediately after injection, these reactive cyanines will
non-specifically interact with all proteins accessible.
In vivo, MRI in combination with non-specific
contrast agents, such as Dotarem, have been employed to
visualize necrosis. However, with this procedure it was
impossible to reliably distinguish healthy from necrotic
tissue or neoplastic growth [19]. Consequently, the focus
shifted towards the development of compounds that could
selectively target necrotic tissues. Already in 1988, Epstein
and colleagues developed monoclonal antibodies against
nuclear antigens, allowing specific targeting of necrotic
tissue present in solid tumors [20]. However, the use of
antibodies is limited due to their size, resulting in limited
tissue penetration, as well as the induction of unwanted
immune responses [21].

Necrosis avid contrast agents (NACAs) are
another class of compounds that specifically accumulate
in necrotic tissue, these are categorized in porphyrin
and non-porphyrin-based compounds. NACAs, such
as the well-known compound hypericin, are assumed
to specifically bind proteins, peptides and nucleotides
that become available upon loss of cell membrane
integrity [22, 23]. However, most of these compounds
have poor solubility, high tendency to aggregate, are
photo-toxic and lack specificity, which are the main
reasons why there are currently no clinically approved
NACAs available [23, 24]. Therefore, there is an unmet
need for non-toxic, small-molecule based probes that can
target necrosis with high specificity for diagnostic imaging
and treatment follow-up.
In the present study, using several in vitro, cell
death, assays, we identified the near infrared fluorescent
(NIRF) carboxylated cyanines, HQ5 and 800CW as new
non-toxic water soluble NACAs. These NACAs bind to
intracellular cytoplasmic proteins of cells that have lost
membrane integrity. We employed quantitative structure
activity relations (QSAR) modelling to predict the overall
trajectory of these dyes to their cellular localization sites.
In contrast to amine-reactive or maleimide containing
cyanines, used for protein labeling, carboxylated cyanines
cannot covalently interact and are therefore indicated as
non-reactive. Next to in vitro studies, we also characterized
the necrosis avid properties of HQ5 and 800CW in an
in vivo 4T1 mouse breast cancer model of spontaneous
tumor necrosis and in an EL4 murine lymphoma model
in which cell death was induced by chemotherapy. In
these animal models, due to their small size, whole
body imaging using NIRF imaging, or multi-spectral
optoacoustic (OA) imaging, is well suited as a light
penetration depth of several cm can be obtained in this
part of the spectrum [25]. The actions of the cyanines were
compared to those of the blood pool agent 800CW-PEG.

represented as, D = dead cells, L = living cells). Cell viability was confirmed by bioluminescent imaging (BLI). After 15 min incubation of
the cells with HQ5 or 800CW and subsequent washing, a strong fluorescent signal was obtained from the area of dead cells. The 800CWPEG signal was almost absent both in the areas of living and dead cells. c. FACS analyses performed with viable 4T1-luc2 cells and 4T1luc2 cells treated with GA (4 uM) or Sta 3 uM) treatment, followed by staining with HQ5 or 800CW. The fluorescence intensity of HQ5 or
800CW stained dead cells was significantly increased compared to that of viable cells. FACS analyses were also performed with viable
and GA treated cells, subsequently stained with 800CW-EGF, 800CW-2DG and 800CW-PEG. The fluorescence intensity of both 800CWEGF and 800CW-2DG, in dead cells, was increased compared to viable cells. Using 800CW-PEG, there was no detectable difference in
fluorescence intensity between viable, dead and unstained cells.

the rim of living cells (L) in the periphery. Moreover,
bioluminescent imaging (BLI) measurements, indicated
that no bioluminescent signals were obtained from the dead
cells in the center of the well while the surrounding living
cells produced strong signals. In contrast, HQ5 or 800CW
incubated wells showed a strong fluorescent signal in the
area of dead cells, but not in the area of living cells. The
non-specific contrast agent 800CW-PEG, however, showed
minimal affinity for dead cells.
The results obtained from the dry ice assay were
confirmed by FACS analysis (Figure 1c). 4T1-luc2 cells

our FACS experiments showed that the commercially
available NIRF imaging probes 800CW-2DG and 800CWEGF in which 2-Deoxyglucose (2-DG) or epidermal
growth factor (EGF) are conjugated to the side chains of
800CW, also specifically accumulated in dead 4T1-luc2
cells However, the non-specific contrast agent 800CWPEG did not accumulate in dead cells.

with AVF phosphatidylserine (PS) staining, as visualized
in the merged image. The intracellular distribution of
HQ5, PI and AVF staining in a single necrotic 4T1-luc2
cell is shown in Figure 2b. PI selectively stained the cell
nucleus whereas AVF membrane staining was spread
unevenly over the entire cell surface leaving the nucleus
unstained. The uneven distribution of the stain may be
explained by the loss of membrane integrity. HQ5 showed
a more uniform granular staining pattern and did not colocalize with the nuclear stain PI or AVF. Furthermore,
Figure 2c–2d shows that the granular HQ5 staining to a

great extent co-localizes with Mito-tracker (mitochondria)
but not with Lyso-tracker (lysosomes). Moreover, HQ5
also reveals a unique perinuclear staining.
Confocal microscopy could not be performed using
800CW as our system is not suitable for the detection of
800 nm fluorescence.
Specific cyanine affinity towards membrane and
cytoplasmatic proteins was examined on SDS-PAGE using
isolated membrane- and cytoplasmic protein fractions of
4T1-luc2 cells. As shown in Figure 3a, HQ5 and 800CW
strongly stained several protein bands in the cytoplasmatic
fraction, but not in the membrane fraction. There was

Coomassie blue staining indicated that proteins were
abundantly present in both fractions.
Furthermore, also affinity of the cyanines towards
serum albumin was examined using SDS-PAGE analysis.
As depicted in Figure 3b, HQ5 shows a stronger dosedependent binding to BSA compared to 800CW, although
binding only occurred at micromolar concentrations

of cryo-sections (Figure 4b) and showed co-localization
with TUNEL staining in parallel paraffin tumor sections
(Figure  4c). As shown in Figure 4d, 800CW and bioconjugated receptor targeting probes 800CW-2DG and
800CW-EGF also strongly accumulated in the necrotic
areas of tumors, indicated by a co-localization with
TUNEL staining. In contrast, 800CW-PEG did not
co-localize with TUNEL staining and most of its
fluorescence signal was localized in the tumor periphery.
Furthermore, we employed 3D Multi-Spectral
Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT) imaging to visualize
the location of HQ5 in the tumor in vivo. As shown in
Figure  5, the HQ5 OA signal co-localized with the
deoxygenated haemoglobin signal present in the center of
the tumor and not with the oxygenated haemoglobin signal
present in the viable rim of the tumor, confirming necrotic
core localization.

Animal model with tumor necrosis
The necrosis avid properties of the cyanines were
evaluated in an animal model of 4T1-luc2 breast tumors,
which, during growth, spontaneously develop a necrotic
core. As shown in Figure 4a, the BLI signal obtained from
these tumors has a lower intensity in the center compared
to the periphery of the tumor, which is indicative of the
presence of a necrotic core. As expected, FLI of the
cyanine HQ5 showed strong accumulation of fluorescence
in the necrotic center of the tumor.
Localization of HQ5 fluorescence in the necrotic
core of the tumor was confirmed in 3D reconstructions

relatively few studies have addressed the possible role
of necrosis as a biomarker for clinical applications. As
a result, clinical probes that specifically image or target
necrosis are currently unavailable. Consequently, we

assay showed a selective staining of dead cells using the
carboxylated cyanines HQ5 and 800CW. However, no
dead cell staining was observed with the macromolecule,
800CW-PEG (25-60 kDa). Nevertheless, the smaller
800CW-conjugated probes, 800CW-EGF (6 kDa) and
800CW-2DG (1 kDa), also selectively stained dead cells.
The results obtained in the dry-ice assay were confirmed
by FACS analysis. The difference in necrosis avidity
between 800CW and its PEG conjugated form might be
due to the relatively large size of PEG which may cause
steric hindrance, as 800CW is maximally 4% of the mass
of the conjugate. In line, de Boer et. al. recently showed
that macromolecule cetuximab-IR Dye 800CW was also
unable to accumulate in tumor necrosis [28]. The binding
to dead cells of the carboxylate forms of 800CW and HQ5
might be unexpected since these compounds, in contrast
to the NHS-ester and maleimide forms, do not contain a
reactive group and mainly serve as “dye-only” control to
examine potential retention of the compound. In addition,
for 800CW it has been shown that after i.v. injection it
does not retain in the body and is rapidly cleared via the
kidneys [29].
Confocal microscopy showed no uptake of any
stain in living cells. Nevertheless, after GA treatment
we observed HQ5 staining coincided with PI but not
with AVF staining. As PI selectively targets cells that
have lost membrane integrity, this characteristic is most
likely also involved in the dead cell targeting of HQ5.
This indicates that HQ5 does not stain apoptotic cells but
specifically targets necrotic cells. On a single cell level
HQ5 staining did not co-localize with either AVF or PI
staining and the granular HQ5 staining pattern appeared
to be cytoplasmic. The cellular localization of 800CW
could not be examined due to the absence of specific 800
nm microscope settings. We confirmed the cytoplasmatic
protein binding of our cyanines by SDS-PAGE analyses
using isolated cell membrane and cytoplasmic protein
fractions of 4T1-luc2 cells. These fractions were
incubated with each dye and we observed that both bound
to cytoplasmic and not to the membrane protein fractions.
The pattern of protein binding of HQ5 and 800CW to
cytoplasmic proteins partly overlapped and also showed
preference for a different subset of proteins. This is most
likely due to the different physical-chemical properties of
these compounds.
Using a QSAR model [30, 31], which is based on
the chemical characteristics of HQ5 and 800CW, the
expected cellular localization was further explored. The
selective accumulation of these dyes in dead cells requires
consideration of both dye and cell properties; the former
being summarized in Figure 1. The major species of both
HQ5 and 800CW under physiological conditions are
anionic (Z values of −1 and −4 respectively). Moreover,
both dyes have conjugated systems of moderate size
(CBN values of 34 and 31). Consequently, the QSAR
model predicts both dyes will bind to proteins, albeit
not extremely strongly, affinity being due both to ionic
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

attractions with cationic protonated amines and to various
non-ionic interactions (van der Waals forces). However,
in other respects the dyes differ markedly. Whilst
800CW is extremely hydrophilic (logP = −9.4) and lacks
amphiphilicity (AI = 0), HQ5 is lipophilic and extremely
amphiphilic (logP = 5.0 and AI = 12.5). Necrotic cells
have two characteristic features, which are significant
in this context. Their membranes, including those of
the plasmalemma and mitochondria, are permeabilized,
permitting the passage of impermeable dyes [32, 33].
As a result, the mitochondrial hydrophobic proteins are
more easily accessed by dyes entering the necrotic cell.
Moreover, protein denaturation will have increased the
number of protein molecules with surface hydrophobic
domains [34].
The hydrophilic character of 800CW renders it
membrane impermeable [31] and so it can only enter
permeabilised cells. Once within them, its accumulation
will be favored by the enhanced dye-binding commonly
found with denatured proteins [35]. As this dye is not
amphiphilic, is does not bind significantly to serum
albumin. HO5, however, is a lipophilic dye which based
on our calculations could possibly enter cells by passive
diffusion [31]. The reason that we do not find this in our
in vitro assay and confocal analysis is most probably due
to the fact that HQ5 is very amphiphilic and will bind to
serum albumin. It has been shown that amphiphilicity is
correlated with serum albumin affinity [31, 36]. Binding
to serum albumin of HQ5 was confirmed by us using
SDS-PAGE analysis. Once the cells have lost membrane
integrity, HQ5 bound to albumin will enter the cells
and will bind to proteins with hydrophobic domains,
such as those common in mitochondria, or those which
are denatured [37]. This is in line with the confocal
microscopy data showing that HQ5 for a large part
co-localizes with Mitotracker. From the QSAR model it
is clear that, although HQ5 and 800CW have different
chemical characteristics, both can bind to proteins but
probably using different mechanisms. This is also reflected
in the difference in binding patterns of the two dyes on
SDS-PAGE, showing that they target similar and partly
different cytoplasmic proteins. Further detailed studies are
needed to elucidate the exact mechanism of binding of the
dyes to necrotic cells.
Dyes with large conjugated systems (CBN > 40),
but lacking amphiphilicity, such as Coomassie Blue and
Evans Blue, are predicted by the QSAR model to bind
strongly to all proteins [31]. Such dyes are therefore not
expected to show selective uptake into necrotic cells, but
will bind to whatever proteins are first contacted.
The question that remains is if, in vivo, 800CW
and HQ5 specifically target necrotic tissues or that
these compounds non-specifically localize in and
around necrotic sites because they comprise blood pool
characteristics? For example, previous studies indicated
that blood pool contrast agents can be employed to
indicate tissue injury, due to their passive leakage from
39043

Oncotarget

blood vessels at sites of tissue damage. In addition, blood
pool agents are employed to detect tumors because of
their ability to accumulate in tumor tissue, as a result
of a process known as the enhanced permeability and
retention (EPR) effect [38]. This process is characterized
by the ability of macromolecules (>20 kDa), or small
molecules bound to serum albumin, to accumulate in
tumors as a result of their passive leakage from abnormal
tumor vasculature. In contrast, small molecules (<20 kDa),
which possess no affinity for blood proteins, do not retain
and rapidly penetrate the interstitial space of tumors and
subsequently diffuse freely back into the blood pool or
the lymphatic system. Therefore, the increased retention
of blood pool agents at or in the vicinity of tissue damage
sites or in tumors is not due to a specific interaction
with necrotic tissue, but is merely the result of reduced
diffusion velocity of large molecules out of the tissue
compartment.
Previous studies and our study show that 800CW
possesses very low affinity for blood proteins and
consequently rapidly extravasates after i.v. injection
[39]. This indicates that the small molecule 800CW is
not a blood pool agent and, therefore, will retain in tissue
because of a specific binding to intracellular proteins
of necrotic cells. The in vivo specificity of 800CW for
necrotic tissues is strengthened by the observation that this
compound strongly co-localizes with TUNEL staining,
a feature that is not observed with the blood pool agent
800CW-PEG. Similar to 800CW, HQ5 also shows a strong
co-localization with TUNEL staining in necrotic areas in
tumors. However, in contrast to 800CW, HQ5 can bind to
serum albumin and thus potentially serves as blood pool
agent. Similarly, the photosensitizer Hypericin, which
is currently under pre-clinical investigation because of
its necrosis avid properties, also possesses affinity for
albumin [40]. In contrast, the well-known blood pool
agent Evans Blue, which also strongly binds to serum
albumin, has been shown to target the viable rim of tumors
rather than the necrotic core [41]. Moreover, based on
the observation that of the albumin binding compounds
Gadophrin-2 and MP2269, only the first possessed NACA
properties Ni et al. [23] stated that necrosis-avidity is an
outstanding feature beyond the general pharmacological
process of albumin-binding mediated drug transportation.
Combined, it might be concluded that the role of blood
protein binding in the mode of action of this particular
group of NACAs needs, to be established.
In our 4T1-luc2 tumor necrosis model, HQ5 and
800CW showed co-localization with TUNEL staining, and
the same was true for the 800CW-EGF and 800CW-2DG
conjugated probes and not for 800CW-PEG. Therefore, it
is important to note that 800CW-EGF and 800CW-2DG,
that are specifically designed and have been extensively
used to target the EGF receptor (EGFR) and the Glucose
receptor-1 (GLUT) [42, 43], also have strong necrosis
avidity due to the presence of CW800 which can direct
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

these probes towards necrotic cells. This new finding
has to be taken into consideration when interpreting
experimental results obtained with 800CW-EGF and
800CW-2DG [29, 44–46].
The necrosis avidity of HQ5 and 800CW was further
investigated in a well-known model of chemotherapy.
We showed that 800CW could be used to monitor early
treatment efficacy. This feature is of great significance
since in current clinical practice the efficacy of anticancer treatment can only reliable be established late
during treatment or after completion of the treatment.
Therefore, currently non-responding patients receive an
expensive treatment and are unnecessarily exposed to side
effects [1, 2]. Finally, it is worth mentioning some of the
limitations of the present study, which include the use of
athymic mice, the use of transplanted and not spontaneous
tumors and the usage of only one type of anti-cancer
treatment, namely chemotherapy.

OA imaging, a technique in which a pulsating light
signal is transformed into an ultrasound wave, provides
much deeper tissue penetration (approximately 5 cm) and
higher resolution than other optical imaging modalities
currently available. This technology can revolutionize
medical imaging in clinical practice. With the development
of a handheld MSOT scanner, with applications in breast
and melanoma imaging, the clinical translation of OA
imaging is already materialized and may also ease the
translation of our necrosis probes to the clinic especially
since we have shown that HQ5 can be detected using
MSOT [47–50].
However, for detection of tumors deep within the
body, when measurements beyond the maximal optical
or OA penetration depth are required, the dyes have to
be radiolabeled in order to allow their visualization
with standard clinical imaging modalities like SPECT
or PET. Our preliminary results show that radiolabeling
of a structural analogue of HQ5 with Indium-111, using
the chelate DTPA is feasible and that this probe still
specifically accumulates in necrotic cells in vitro and in
necrotic cores of tumors (unpublished data). Moreover,
from an economical point of view it is worth to mention
that the production costs of the cyanines, especially when
synthesized in bulk amounts are low and that the rates for
radio labeling and subsequent SPECT/PET scanning will
be comparable to those of other clinically used SPECT/
PET probes.
The concept of employing tissue necrosis, as a
biomarker for diagnostic and prognostic purposes of
disease, is not new. With the objective to target and
image necrotic tissue, already back in 1988 Epstein and
colleagues developed several so called TNT antibodies [20]
and more recently Ni and colleagues [22, 40, 51,  52]
reported on the specific necrosis avid properties of the
39044

Oncotarget

photosensitizer Hypericin in small animals. However,
both compounds were examined not just for their potential
as contrast agents, but also for their possible usage in
cancer treatment by coupling of Iodine-131 used for local
radionuclide therapy. In this way, when the necrosis avid
agent has accumulated in the necrotic core of the tumor, the
cancer is selectively irradiated and killed from the inside.
After showing proof of concept, in animal studies [53], the
TNT antibodies even reached clinical phase I and II studies
[54]. However, for both TNT antibodies and Hypericin,
full clinical translation is hampered because of increased
concern about adverse effects and other drawbacks based
on their physical-chemical properties [54, 55]. No such
concerns are expected with the employment of the NIRF
cyanines examined in this study. NIRF cyanines are
successfully used already for more than a decennium for
experimental and clinical experimental purposes including
fluorescence image guided surgery without serious side
effects [56]. In addition, toxicity studies by Marshall and
colleagues, showed that 800CW carboxylate administrated
as a single intravenous or intradermal dose of 20 mg/kg,
which is about 100-fold above the maximum dose utilized
in our experiments, did not result in any pathological
evidence of toxicity in rats [29]. Therefore, our necrosis
avid carboxylated NIRF dyes can potentially be used
clinically to image necrotic tissue for diagnostic and
prognostic purposes, to detect treatment response in tumors
and for drug delivery.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the
carboxylated cyanines 800CW and HQ5, as well as 800CW2DG and 800CW-EGF, possess strong necrosis avid
properties. The molecular mechanism of necrosis avidity
involves targeting of cytoplasmic proteins after loss of
cell membrane integrity. Using NIRF imaging in different
mouse models of cancer, we showed that these dyes can be
applied to detect spontaneous tumor necrosis, which is of
diagnostic and prognostic value. Moreover, we showed that
they can be utilized to monitor early treatment responses in
tumors after anti-cancer therapy and potentially they can
also be used for drug delivery. Therefore, when translated
to the clinic, these compounds might become of great value
in cancer diagnostics and treatment.

800CW-2-Deoxyglucose (800CW-2DG), 800CW-epidermal
growth factor (800CW-EGF) and 800CW-polyethylene
glycol (800CW-PEG) were obtained from LI-COR
Biosciences.

Cells and culture conditions
4T1-luc2 murine mammary cancer cells
(PerkinElmer) were cultured in complete RPMI1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). EL4 murine
lymphoma cells were cultured in complete Iscove’s
Modified Dulbecco’s Medium (Life Technologies). Cells
were transduced with a lentivirus for the expression of
CBG99 luciferase under the control of the constitutive
promoter PGK as described previously to create
EL4-CBG99-luc [57].

Dry ice dead cell assay
In vitro, cell death was studied using a cryo-induced
cell death assay, which detailed procedures have been
described previously [26]. Briefly, a bar of dry ice was
applied to the underside of the culture well confluent with
4T1-luc2 cells for 15 sec. Subsequently, the cells were
incubated with HQ5, 800CW or 800CW-PEG, respectively
(100 nM, 15 min, room temperature (RT), in the dark).
After gentle washing with PBS, the samples were scanned
for fluorescence imaging (FLI) using an Odyssey Infrared
Imager 9120 (LI-COR). For bioluminescence imaging
(BLI), D-luciferin solution (25 μg/μl; SynChem Inc.) was
added for 10 min incubation. BLI measurements were
then acquired using an IVIS Spectrum imaging system
(PerkinElmer).

FACS analyses
The detailed procedures for flow cytometry of cells
after inducing cell death have been described previously
[26]. Briefly, 4T1-luc2 cells were incubated in the
presence or absence of gambogic acid (GA, 4 μM, 24 h,
Calbiochem) or Staurosporine (Sta, 3 μM, 24 h, SigmaAldrich). Cells were then collected and re-suspended in
100 μl PBS. The cell suspensions were incubated in the
dark for 15 min at RT with one of the cyanines (200 nM).
Alternatively, cells were stained with the commercially
available cell death probes AVF and PI (PromoKine)
in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocols. Flow
cytometry was performed using a BD LSR II or Canto II
Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences). The data was analyzed
using FlowJo software.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
QSAR modelling
Estimation of the structure parameters for
carboxylated HQ5 and IRDye 800CW (800CW) and the
integration of the parameters with appropriate QSAR
models was carried out as detailed elsewhere [30, 31].

Confocal microscopy

Cyanines

4T1-luc2 cells were cultured in a glass bottomed
culture dish (MatTek Corp.) until 80% confluent. Cell
death was induced by incubation with GA (3 μM, 1 h).
Subsequently, the cells were washed gently with PBS and

HQ5 carboxylate was obtained from Ilumicare
BV  (Rotterdam, The Netherlands). The dyes 800CW,

15 min at RT. AVF and PI were used in accordance with the
manufacturer’s protocols. Afterwards, samples were imaged
using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope (Leica).

3D fluorescent cryomicrotome imaging of a tumor
was reconstructed according the previous published
methods [58]. In brief, tumor samples were immersed
in carboxymethylcellulose sodium solvent (Brunschwig
Chemie, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) mixed with 5%
Indian ink (Royal Talens, Apeldoorn, The Netherlands)
and frozen for at least 24 hrs at −25°C. After each cut,
tumor epi-illumination outline images were acquired
at an excitation wavelength of 440 nm/20 nm (central
wavelength and bandwidth) and an emission wavelength
of 435 nm/25 nm, with 300 ms illumination time. Images
of tumor fluorescence were acquired at an excitation
wavelength of 640 nm/50 nm and an emission wavelength
of 712 nm/75 nm, 5000 ms illumination. All tissue
samples were imaged in one session with camera binning
set at 2048 × 2048 pixel resolution, with a corresponding
in-plane resolution of 17 μm. Prior to further analysis,
images were converted to 8 bit grey scale.

SDS-PAGE analyses
Cytoplasmic and membrane protein samples of
4T1-luc2 cells were prepared using a subcellular protein
fractionation kit (Thermo Scientific) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Samples of protein extracts
(2 μg per lane) were incubated with either HQ5 or 800CW
(1 μM) for 15 min at RT in the dark. For Bovine serum
albumin (BSA) commercial preparations of BSA (5 μg per
lane, Life Technologies) were incubate with either HQ5
or 800CW (0.1, 0.5 and 2 μM, respectively) for 15 min
at RT in the dark. Subsequently, samples were mixed
with SDS-PAGE sample buffer without indicative blue
dye and loaded onto reduced 12.5% SDS polyacrylamide
gel. The precision plus protein marker (BIO-RAD) was
loaded to one extra lane. After running SDS-PAGE, the gel
was processed for FLI using the Odyssey Infrared Imager
9120 scanner. Finally, protein samples were stained
with Coomassie brilliant blue staining (BIO-RAD) and
photographed.

MSOT imaging
A group (n = 3) of female athymic nude-Fox1nu
mice was inoculated with 4T1 cells and subjected to
MSOT measurements. MSOT measurements were
performed using the inVision 256-TF system (iThera
Medical GmbH, Munich, Germany) according to the
protocol described previously [59, 60]. In brief, the mice
were anesthetized and placed in supine position in the
animal holder throughout the entire imaging process.
Cross-sectional multispectral OA image datasets were
acquired through the tumor at eight different wavelengths
in the NIR window (690, 700, 710, 740, 760, 780, 800
and 900 nm). MSOT datasets are reconstructed using the
interpolated model-matrix inversion. Afterwards, linear
spectral unmixing is applied to each set of multiwavelength
images to resolve biodistribution of the different tissue
chromophores and the contrast agent, i.e. oxygenized and
deoxygenized haemoglobin and HQ5 [61].

Animals
Female athymic mice (BALB/c nu/nu, 6 weeks old)
were acquired from Charles River Laboratories (L’Arbresle
Cedex, France). All experimental procedures were
performed under isoflurane gas anesthesia (3% induction,
1.5–2% maintenance) in 70% pressurized air and 30% O2,
unless stated differently. Animals were sacrificed by
cervical dislocation at the end of the experimental period.
The animals were housed per 4–5 animals in individually
ventilated cages with ad libitum access to food and water.
All animal experiments were assessed for animal health &
ethics and approved by the Animal Welfare Committee of
Leiden University Medical Center, the Netherlands. All
mice received humane care and were kept in compliance
with the Code of Practice Use of Laboratory Animals in
Cancer Research (Inspectie W&V, July 1999).

Chemotherapy of murine lymphomas
Two randomized groups mice (n = 3) received
a subcutaneous (s.c.) inoculation with 1 × 105 EL4CBG99-luc murine lymphoma cells on the upper
back. 11 days after inoculation, the animals either
received chemotherapy consisting of i.p. injection of a
combination of cyclophosphamide (CTX, 100 mg/kg;
Baxter BV, The Netherlands) and etoposide (ETO,
70 mg/kg; Pharmachemie BV, The Netherlands) or
remained untreated. After 24 h, all animals received
an i.v. injection of 800CW (5 nmole per mouse).
FLI  measurements were performed another 24 h after
injection using the IVIS spectrum. Whole body BLI
measurements were performed, before and 24 h after
injection of the chemotherapeutic agents, 10 min after i.p.
administering D-luciferin (150 mg/kg). After FLI, all mice

Spontaneous tumor necrosis model
Mice (n = 5) received orthotopic inoculations of
2 × 104 4T1-luc2 cells beneath the upper mammary fat
pad. Trypan Blue (Sigma-Aldrich) exclusion was used to
examine the viability of the tumor cells before injection.
After three weeks, tumors were formed, containing a
spontaneous necrotic core. Whole body BLI and FLI
measurements were performed using the IVIS Spectrum,
with either 10 min post D-luciferin (150 mg/kg) per
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection or 24 h post HQ5 (2 nmole
per mouse) per i.v. injection.
