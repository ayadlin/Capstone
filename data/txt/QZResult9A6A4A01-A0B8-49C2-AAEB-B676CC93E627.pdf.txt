Abstract
Reprogramming energy metabolism, such as enhanced glycolysis, is an Achilles’
heel in cancer treatment. Most studies have been performed on isolated cancer
cells. Here, we studied the energy-transfer mechanism in inflammatory tumor
microenvironment. We found that human THP-1 monocytes took up lactate secreted
from tumor cells through monocarboxylate transporter 1. In THP-1 monocytes,
the oxidation product of lactate, pyruvate competed with the substrate of proline
hydroxylase and inhibited its activity, resulting in the stabilization of HIF-1α
under normoxia. Mechanistically, activated hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α in THP-1
monocytes promoted the transcriptions of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 and
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, which were the key enzyme of prostaglandin
E2 synthesis and gluconeogenesis, respectively, and promote the growth of human
colon cancer HCT116 cells. Interestingly, lactate could not accelerate the growth of
colon cancer directly in vivo. Instead, the human monocytic cells affected by lactate
would play critical roles to ‘feed’ the colon cancer cells. Thus, recycling of lactate for
glucose regeneration was reported in cancer metabolism. The anabolic metabolism of
monocytes in inflammatory tumor microenvironment may be a critical event during
tumor development, allowing accelerated tumor growth.

Introduction

lactate is a metabolic key player as well as a core signaling
molecular in cancer.
Lactate is an anion and therefore requires
transporters to efficiently cross cell membranes. This
function is predominantly exerted by monocarboxylate
transporter (MCT) [6]. The transport of lactate is important
for tumors, not only to prevent cellular acidification
through exporting lactic acid, but also to sustain growth
and metastasis through importing lactate [7]. Of the MCT
families, MCT1 and MCT4 play predominant roles in the
majority of cancer cells. There is a preferential expression
of MCT1 in normoxic cells with oxidative potential [8],
whereas MCT4 expression is predominant in glycolytic/
hypoxic cells [9]. Lactate is primarily exported by

Warburg effect is a common feature of cancer
cells. In over 70% of all human cancers worldwide, the
glycolysis-related genes are overexpressed [1].Thus,
tremendous amounts of researches in the field of tumor
glycolysis and lactate metabolism are being in progress.
To meet the need of rapid growth, cancer cells increases
glucose uptake and accumulates lactate. This phenomenon
clearly indicates that lactate is not a surrogate of tumor
hypoxia. More than a metabolic waste, the lactate anion is
known to participate to cancer aggressiveness, including
metastasis, radio resistance, angiogenesis and immune
escape of tumor cells [2-5]. These findings suggest that

MCT4 from glycolytic tumor cells or stromal cells [10],
whereas is taken up by MCT1 to participate carbohydrate
metabolism.
Previous studies concerning glycolytic metabolism
dysfunction gave more attentions on the biochemical
regulation and certain factors in isolated tumor cells
and tumor cell lines, and ignored recycled nutrients
between cells in tumor microenvironment. Tumor
microenvironment, which contains stromal fibroblasts,
inflammatory cells, vascular endothelial cells and so on,
is critical for the initiation and progression of cancer.
Currently, the team of Prof. Lisanti reported a new
energy-transfer mechanism “Two-Compartment Tumor
Metabolism” between cancer cells and cancer associated
fibroblasts to reflect that the production, consumption
and recycle of nutrients [11, 12]. Inflammation is the
indispensable part of tumor microenvironment, and
works at all stages of tumorigenesis. Production of
tumor-promoting cytokines by immune/inflammatory
cells, such as prostaglandin E2 (PEG2), results in the
activation of transcription factors and induces expression
of genes promoting cancer development [13]. As above
described, though some studies involving in the recycle
metabolism of cancer associated fibroblasts have been
conducted [11], rare crosstalk was investigated between
the cancer glycolytic metabolism and tumor inflammatory
microenvironment.
Here, we explored energy-transfer mechanism
of human monocytic cells in tumor inflammatory
microenvironment. THP-1 monocytes were one of
most widely used cell lines to investigate the function
and regulation of monocytes and macrophages, and an
important tool to mimic the inflammatory cells in tumor
microenvironment. Interestingly, our experimental
evidence indicates the “Two-Compartment Tumor
Metabolism” occurred THP-1 monocytes and colon
cancer cells. We found lactate secreted by cancer cells
promote the synthesis of PGE2 of THP-1 monocytes
through stabilizing hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) in normoxia. HIF-1α is a critical oncogene and
transcription factor involving in the metabolic switch from
oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) toward an altered
glycolysis [14]. HIF-1α is also capable of modulating
the transcription of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase
2 (COX2), which is the key enzyme for PGE2 synthesis
[15, 16]. Usually, HIF-1α is controlled by cellular oxygen
concentrations via prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) and the
von Hippel–Lindau (vHL) complex, and is easily degraded
in normoxia. However, recent studies demonstrate that
HIF-1α is stabilized even under normoxic conditions
by the products of glycolysis, lactate and pyruvate [5,
17]. Therefore, lactate from cancer cells functions as
an onco-metabolite, stabilizing HIF-1α and stimulating
mitochondrial biogenesis in adjacent monocytic cells.
In addition to oxidation by lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH), lactate became the raw material and engaged in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

gluconeogenesis in THP-1 monocytes. The transcriptional
upregulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase
(PEPCK) by HIF-1α was responsible for the surge of
lactate to gluconeogenesis.
In this context, human monocytic cells recycle
lactate to glucose, serving as a high-energy mitochondrial
“fuel” for cancer cells growth. The metabolic feedback
loop in tumor inflammatory microenvironment drives
tumor-inflammation co-evolution. The deep-going
studies of the metabolic regulation in tumor inflammatory
microenvironment will provide fresh insight into the
cancer metabolism, and help us finding the new targets for
cancer therapies.

exhibits
active
gluconeogenesis-like character
In 2010, a novel theory named “Reversed Warburg
effect” challenge the millstone of cancer biology studying,
which supported the idea of stromal-epithelial metabolic
coupling in the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, we
suspected whether there was a similar “Two-Compartment
Tumor Metabolism” model in the inflammatory tumor
microenvironment.
In order to investigate the glycolysis metabolism
of inflammatory cells in the tumor microenvironment,
we cultured human colorectal cancer HCT116 cells for
48 h and used the condition medium (CM) to stimulate
human THP-1 monocytes for various times. Surprisingly,
the glucose in CM did not decrease until THP-1 was
stimulated for 12 h (Figure 1A); and the lactate in CM
was little changed (Figure 1B). This phenomenon is
seemed that THP-1 monocytes used the lactate in CM
for regeneration of glucose instead of energy production,
which exactly is similar to the process of gluconeogenesis.
To further identify the speculation that THP-1 monocytes
came into gluconeogenesis in the inflammatory tumor
microenvironment , we co-cultured THP-1 monocytes
with HCT116 cells by using Milli hang culture well.
As a result, though the secreted lactate increased gently
within 12 h (Figure 1A), the glucose in the co-cultured
medium still appeared an ascending trend for 12 h coculture, and declined later(Figure 1B). We even contacted
HCT116 cells with THP-1 monocytes, and obtained
the consistent result in the change of glucose amount
(Figure S1A). Besides in human colon cancer HCT116
cells, we also tested this model in other human cancer
cell lines, including human colon cancer HT29 cells,
Caco2 cells, human hepatoma HepG2 cells, and human
breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. The trends of lactate
and glucose in the models of other cancer cell lines were

the same as that of HCT116 cells (Figure S2A and S2B).
Especially, glucose in both CM and co-cultured medium
for THP-1 monocytes appeared ascending trend first, and
declined later (Figure S2B). All the results suggested
that the gluconeogenesis of THP-1 monocytes could
be triggered by cancer cells in the inflammatory tumor
microenvironment.

increased (Figure S2C). These results demonstrated that
cancer cells promoted the generation of PGE2 of THP-1
monocytes.

Lactate was taken up through MCT1 and
promoted the gluconeogenesis and PGE2
generation of THP-1 monocytes

The generation of PGE2 of THP-1 monocytes was
promoted by colorectal tumor HCT116 cells

Based above phenomenon, we wondered what the
signaling molecules released by cancer cells, stimulated
the gluconeogenesis and PGE2 generation of THP-1
monocytes. Considering all the three culture models of
THP-1 monocytes (including simulated with CM, cocultured in hang culture well, and contact co-cultured)
resulted in glycogenesis and increased PGE2 secretion, we
exclude the influence of cell contact and pointed to some
certain molecules secreted by cancer cells. After HCT 116
cells were cultured for 48 h, the culture supernatant liquid
accumulated lactate and contained little glucose (Figure
S1C and S1D). Lactate is the byproduct of “Warburg
effect” as well as the raw material gluconeogenesis.
Therefore, we picked out lactate to explore its functions
from the numerous of factors in inflammatory tumor

PGE2 is a bioactive lipid that can elicit a wide range
of biological effects associated with inflammation and
cancer. Subsequently, the influences of cancer cells on
PGE2 secretion of inflammatory cells were investigated.
We detected the content of PGE2 in the culture medium
by ELISA method. Compared with the THP-1 monocytes
cultured solely, the release of PGE2 in THP-1 monocytes
stimulated with culture supernatant liquid of HCT116,
or co-cultured with HCT116 cells using hang culture
well (Figure 1C), or contact co-cultured (Figure S1B),
were all increased. As well, the release of PGE2 in THP1 monocytes stimulated by other cancer cell lines were

microenvironment.
When HCT116 cells were cultured alone for 48 h,
the concentration of lactate reached nearly 5 mM (Figure
S1C). Therefore, for mimic the acidic environment, we
added lactate solution to the glucose-free culture medium
and used 5 mM as an initial reference concentration to
stimulate THP-1 monocytes. As a result, the lactate in the
medium was decreased, and glucose generation and PGE2
release were both increased along with the increased
concentration or time of lactate stimulation (Figure 1D to
1I, and Figure S1B). Instead, little influence on cell growth
was observed (Figure S1E, S1F and S1G).
Among monocarboxylate transports (MCT) family,
MCT1 and MCT4 were mainly responsible for the export
and import of lactate, respectively. Upon the stimulation
of lactate, MCT1 protein expression of THP-1 monocytes
was increased, but MCT4 not (Figure 2A). Moreover,

stimulation of THP-1 monocytes with CM of HCT116
cells(Figure 2C), or co-cultured with HCT116 cells using
hang culture well (Figure 2D), resulted in the upregulation
of MCT1 protein expression as well. In the models based
on other cancer cells, MCT1 protein expressions of THP1 monocytes were enhanced by stimulated of CM or cocultured with cancer cells (Figure S3).
To further verify the effects of lactate and MCT1,
we used 4-(Chloromercuric) benzoic acid (PCMB, MCT1
inhibitor [18]) to inhibit the lactate uptake (Figure 2E and
2F). PCMB inhibited the lactate-induced gluconeogenesis
and PGE2 production in THP-1 monocytes (Figure 2G and
2H). The glucose generation and PGE2 secretion in THP1 monocytes stimulated with CM, were also inhibited by
PCMB (Figure 2I and 2J).
The above results showed that lactate was
an important inducer of the gluconeogenesis and

cultured and CM culture, the level of PEPCK as well as
FBPase of THP-1 monocytes were increased (Figs. 3C,
3D and 3E). On the other hand, COX2 is an enzyme to
produce PGE2. In the studies the mRNA expression and
protein expression of COX2 were both increased in THP-1
monocytes upon the lactate treatment, as well as in cocultured and CM cultured THP-1 monocytes (Figure 3B
to 3E). Beside, expressions of COX2 and PEPCK protein
in THP-1 monocytes cultured in CM or with cancer cells
were enhanced in the models based on other cancer cells
(Figure S3)
To verify our results in vivo, we modeled mice
bearing acute colitis and colitis-associated cancer (CAC).
The immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that
both the colitis group and CAC group showed high level
of COX2 (Figure 3F). In addition, apparently higher level
of PEPCK was only observed in CAC group (Figure 3F).
To distinguish the monocytes with colon cancer cells
, F4/80 was used to mark monocytes[19]. The tissue
immunofluorescence results showed both the colitis group
and CAC group showed high expression of COX2 (Figure
3G). However, the high expressions of PEPCK (Figure

Lactate upregulated the transcription of PEPCK
and COX2 in THP-1 monocytes both in vitro and
in vivo
From the above results, we inferred that lactate
acted as a key regulator of glucose and PGE2 generation
in THP-1 monocytes co-cultured with HCT116 cells.
Glucose-6-phosphatase
(G6Pase),
fructose-1,6bisphosphatase (FBPase) and phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxykinase (PEPCK), are the three key rate-limiting
enzymes controlling gluconeogenesis. To investigate the
further mechanism, we assayed the influence of lactate
on these rate-limiting enzymes of gluconeogenesis firstly.
Levels of the three enzymes were little changed in THP-1
monocytes cultured alone (Figure 3A and 3E). And 10 mM
lactate could increase the protein and gene expressions of
PERCK in THP-1 monocytes, instead had little effects
on G6Pase and FBPase (Figure 3B and 3E). Under co-

that monocytes with high expression of HIF1α were only
appeared in colon tissue of CAC group (Figure 4F and
4G).
The stabilization of HIF1α was regulated by its
posttranslational hydroxylation via PHDs. Although
lactate could increase HIF-1α mRNA transcription,
lactate (10 mM) still induced HIF-1α protein expression
in the presence of the transcription inhibitor Actinomycin
D (5μg/ml) (Figure 4H), suggesting lactate could affect
the stabilization of HIF-1α protein. Therefore, we
tested whether lactate could interfere with the proline
hydroxylase (PHD) reaction, which hydroxylate 2
proline residues of HIF-1α. Considering that PHD
activity requires 2-oxoglutarate as a substrate and may
therefore be influenced by other carboxylates [20, 21], we
designed competition experiments between lactate and
2-oxoglutarate in normoxic THP-1 monocytes. Addition
of 2-oxoglutarate to THP-1 monocytes reduced the
abundance of HIF-1α induced by lactate in a concentration
dependent manner (Figure 4I). Moreover, we detected
hydroxylated HIF-1α level to reflect PHD activity. As a
result, the level of hydroxylated HIF-1α was decreased
in co-cultured, lactate-treated, and CM-stimulated THP-

HIF-1α is a key regulator of tumor
microenvironment, which regulates the transcription of
many factors involving with metabolism, inflammatory
response, and so on. HIF-1α was degraded quickly in
normoxic environment (Figure 4B). Whereas after THP-1
monocytes were stimulated with lactate under normoxia,
the protein expression of HIF-1α sustained stable
during 20 h and was upregulated upon 10 mM lactate
(Figure 4A). In the co-cultured and CM cultured THP-1
monocytes, HIF-1α appeared to stable as well in normoxic
environment (Figure 4C and 4D). Moreover, the mRNA
levels of HIF-1α in THP-1 monocytes stimulated with
lactate, or CM, or co-cultured with HCT116 cells using
hang culture well, were all increased (Figure 4E). The
changes of HIF-1α protein in the models based on other
cell lines also presented the consistent results as above
(Figure S3). Meanwhile, in vivo immunohistochemical
staining and tissue immunofluorescence demonstrated

2 levels. To examine the transcriptional regulation of
HIF-1α on COX2 and PEPCK, THP-1 monocytes were
treated with increasing concentrations of the hypoxia
surrogate deferoxamine mesylate (DFX, a specific HIF1α inducer [22]) 500 μM for 12 h. As a result, the DFX
treatment stabilized HIF-1α and increased COX-2 and
PEPCK protein levels in THP-1 monocytes in normoxia
(Figure 5A). Additionally, inhibiting HIF-1α induction
using 200 μM YC-1[23] abolished the up-regulation
of COX-2 and PEPCK (Figure 5A). In the co-cultured
and CM cultured THP-1 monocytes, YC-1 blocked the
increase of COX-2 and PEPCK proteins (Figure 5B and
5C). And lactate-increased COX-2 and PEPCK (Figure

generation (Figure 5F), were all reversed by YC-1. These

results demonstrated that HIF-1α was involved in the
upregulation of COX2 and PEPCK in THP-1 monocytes
Then we found the nuclear translocation of HIF1α were increased in THP-1 monocytes upon lactate
stimulation and co-cultured (Figure 5G). The tissue
immunofluorescence results also demonstrated a strong
nuclear translocation of HIF-1α (Figure 4G, Merge 2).
These prompted the function of HIF-1α as a transcription
factor. HIF-1α has been shown to bind HRE on promoters
of target genes and activate their transcription[24], and
COX-2 promoter and PEPCK promoter were both reported
to contain a functional HRE[15, 25].

To test the physical interaction of HIF-1α with
the HRE of the human COX-2 promoter and human
PEPCK promoter, we used biotinylated double-stranded
oligonucleotides of COX2 and PEPCK containing HRE,
respectively, to pull-down HIF-1α. Because HIF-1α might
be not the unique transcriptional regulator of COX2 or
PRPCK, human HIF-1α recombinant protein was used to
indicate the binding site of HIF-1α with COX2 or PRPCK
promotor. The bound protein complexes were analyzed
by EMSA. As shown in Figs. 6A and 6B, HIF-1α bound
to the WT HRE oligonucleotide but not to a similar
oligonucleotide with the HRE mutated. In the co-cultured,

CM cultured, and lactate stimulated THP-1 monocytes,
the binding capacity of HIF-1α to the WT oligonucleotide
of COX-2 promoter and PEPCK promoter were increased
(Figure 6C and 6D). These results indicated that HIF-1α
directly bound with the HRE derived from the COX-2
promoter and PEPCK promoter. ChIP analysis showed
that HIF-1α could bind to the promoter of COX-2 in cocultured, CM cultured as well as lactate stimulated THP1 monocytes endogenously (Figure 6E). Furthermore,
to investigate the transcriptional activation of COX2
and PEPCK promoter, we constructed the pGL3-BasicCOX-2-promoter reporter gene plasmid and pGL3-BasicPEPCK-promoter reporter gene plasmid, which contained
the corresponding promoters with wild-type HRE
sequence. Lactate promoted the transcriptional activity
of COX-2 and PEPCK promoter in THP-1 monocytes,
as well as in co-cultured and LS stimulated THP-1
monocytes (Figure 6F and 6G).

All together, these results suggested that COX-2 and
PEPCK were the target genes of HIF-1α. Lactate promoted
the HIF-1α-regulated positive transcription of COX-2 and
PEPCK in THP1 monocytes.

In the inflammatory tumor microenvironment, the
cancer cells and the inflammatory cells work cooperatively.
In the above studies, we found the lactate secreted from
colorectal cancer HCT116 cells, could promote the PGE2
and glucose synthesis of THP-1 monocytes. Therefore,
we subsequently investigated the influence of THP-1
monocytes on the progression and growth of cancer cells.

HCT116 cells co-cultured with THP-1 monocytes were
stronger than the HCT116 cells cultured alone. Moreover,
the protein level of c-myc was increased in co-cultured
HCT116 cells (Figure 7D). The other significant change
was the activation of MAPK pathway, especially ERK

(PDHK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glucose
transporter 4 (Glut4), and phosphofructokinase 3
(PFBFK3) were all increased (Figure 7D). In further
studies, we found the mobility and the capacity resisting
apoptosis of HCT116 cells were both strengthened under
the treatment of PGE2 (Figure S5A and S5B). And PGE2
activated AKT, ERK, p38 to promote the cell growth
(Figure S5C); and upregulated the protein expressions of
HKII, Glut4, and PFBFK3 to increased glycolytic capacity
of HCT116 cells (Figure S5D). Besides, in other cell lines,
including HT29, Caco2, MDA-MB-231 and HepG2 cells,
THP-1 monocytes upregulated the expressions of c-myc,
p-ERK, HKII, glut4 (Figure S4).
To investigate the effect of inflammatory
microenvironment in cancer growth in vivo, we developed
another in vivo model beside CAC model. We mixed
THP-1 monocytes and HCT116 cells in 1:1 proportion,
and inoculated cell suspension on nude mice. We found
that the tumor in HCT116+/THP1+/lactate- group had
significantly strong growth capacity (4.6 folds) than
HCT116+/THP1-/lactate- group (Figure 7E and 7F).
However, THP-1 monocytes alone (HCT116 -/THP1+/
lactate- group and HCT116 -/THP1+/lactate+ group) had
little tumorigenicity (Figure 7E), removing the interference
of THP1 monocytes on tumor size and weight. Therefore,
these result suggested that THP-1 monocytes promoted the
growth of human colon HCT116 cells in vivo.
Then we added 20 mM lactate to the Matrigel
mixing with cell suspension, and inoculated. The tumor
weight of the group that contained THP-1 monocytes, the
tumor in HCT116+/THP1+/lactate+ group was still bigger
HCT116+/THP1-/lactate- group (Figure 7E). Interestingly,
20 mM exogenous lactate did not showed advantage
growth of xenograft in both HCT116+/THP1-/lactate+
group and HCT116+/THP1+/lactate+ group (Figure 7E).
However, we analyzed HE staining and found that the
HCT116+/THP1+/lactate+ group showed the strongest
inflammatory infiltration, and the HCT116+/THP1+/
lactate- group is the next strongest (Figure 7G and 7H).
These results demonstrated that lactate did not promote
tumor growth directly, but influenced the inflammatory
monocytes around cancer cells. Based on this speculation,
we detected the expressions of HIF-1α, COX2 and
PEPCK in tumor tissue, and marked monocytes by F4/80
(Figure 8). Compared HCT116-/THP1+/lactate- group with
HCT116+/THP1-/lactate- group, we found the expressions
of HIF-1α, COX2 and PEPCK were up-regulated,
especially in monocytes. And exogenous lactate could
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

further enhance the levels of HIF-1α, COX2 and PEPCK
of THP-1 monocytes.
Taken together, lactate in tumor microenvironment
influenced THP-1 monocytes and increased the
expressions of HIF-1α, COX2 and PEPCK. Then THP1 monocytes “fed” colorectal tumor HCT116 cells to
promoted tumor growth.

Discussion
Tumor lactate can predict for metastases and overall
survival of patients in several types of human cancers.
Although lactate was initially considered merely as an
indicator of the glycolysis of normal tissue physiology,
many evidences recently transposed to the tumor situation
indicate that lactate directly contributes to tumor growth
and progression. Here, we modeled the inflammatory
tumor microenvironment by co-culture human cancer
cells with THP-1 monocytes, and reported a new energytransfer mechanism of “Two-Compartment Tumor
Metabolism” inflammatory tumor microenvironment.
As shown in Figure 7I, the lactate from cancer cells is
secreted into the microenvironment, and taken up by
surrounding THP-1 monocytes through MCT1. In addition
to being used as a fuel for oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS), lactate brought significant influences to THP1 monocytes. On one hand, lactate oxidation increases
the pool of intracellular pyruvate, which competes with
2-oxoglutarate from PHD, resulting in HIF-1α protein
stabilization and HIF-1 activation. Transcription of COX2
is up-regulated, prompting the synthesis of PGE2. On the
other hand, lactate in THP-1 monocytes was recycled for
gluconeogenesis pathway and synthesize glucose again.
The upregulation of PEPCK plays an important role.
Both COX2 and PEPCK were targeted genes of HIF1α. Finally, THP-1 monocytes nourish cancer cells and
accelerated tumor growth.
Long before 20th century, lactate was largely
considered as a dead-end waste product of glycolysis,
resulting in muscle fatigue and acidosis-induced tissue
damage. The discovery of Cori Cycle, and emergence
of the concept “lactate shuttles” amplified the biological
function of lactate[26-28]. These pioneering advances
in the lactate activities in normal tissues have only
recently been translated into new insight of tumor.
Rather than a metabolic intermediate, lactate acts as
a signaling molecule and plays significant roles in
cancer development. Increasing evidences indicate that
lactate in tumors is a fuel for the oxidative metabolism
of oxygenated tumor cells [10, 29, 30], a power for the
metastasis of tumor and endothelial cells[31, 32], and an
important contributor to angiogenesis [33]. Although, the
growth-promoting effect of lactate in some certain cancer
cells was reported [34], our studies showed that exogenous
lactate did not show the direct benefit for tumor growth
of HCT116 cells (Figure 7F). We even found that high
16207

concentration of exogenous lactate was cytotoxic to tumor
(Figure S6). One reason for this result was the significantly
down-regulated expression of MCT during the transition
from normality to malignancy in human colon[35]. The
low expression of MCT1 in colon cancer was beneficial
for the development of cancer, and correlated with the
deregulation of many butyrate-responsive genes that are
involved in the processes of apoptosis, proliferation and
differentiation in colon carcinoma tissue. Although lactate
could not accelerate tumor growth directly, we found
that lactate influenced monocytes in inflammatory tumor
microenvironment (Figure 8), promoting the development
of cancer. Besides, several studies have shown that lactate
influences vascular endothelial cell, tumor-associated
fibroblasts, tumor-associated macrophages, and other

immune cells to promote tumor angiogenesis, invasion,
metastasis and immune escape.
Along with the raise of “tumor microenvironment”
conception, THP-1 cell line became an important tool to
mimic the inflammatory cells in tumor microenvironment.
It has been reported that THP-1 monocytes owned the
capability to behave distinct functional programs in
response to different microenvironmental signals, such as
microbial stimuli or cytokines[36]. In our studies, THP-1
monocytes were affected by the lactate from tumor and
then “fed” cancer cells, promoting tumor development.
Lactate acted as a hypoxia-mimetic able to activate the
transcription factor HIF-1 originally in THP-1 monocytes.
The underlying pathway required lactate oxidation into
pyruvate to compete with 2-oxoglutarate (a by-product of

the TCA cycle) for the control of PHD activity. Activated
HIF-1α in THP-1 monocytes increased the transcription of
COX2, promoting PGE2 synthesis. In addition to PGE2,
human monocytes “fed” cancer cells with high-energy fuel
glucose, which was generated by the recycle of lactate.
The transcriptional upregulation of rate-limiting enzyme
(PEPCK, FBPase, and G6Pase) in gluconeogenesis
were responsible for the glucose generation. Beside the
HIF-1α-mediated transcription of PEPCK, we found
that the protein level of FBPase was upregulated in cocultured condition (Figure 3D). The induction of HIF1α by DFX and the inhibition of HIF-1α by YC-1 had
little influence on FBPase expression (Figure S7A and
S7B), suggesting that FBPase was not the targeted gene
of HIF-1α. Therefore, some other transcription factor,
including peroxisome proliferator activated receptors
(PPARs), PPARγ coactivator 1α (PGC1α), and estrogenrelated receptors (ERRs), were investigated. PPARs
modulate the expression of genes regulating glucose
and lipid metabolism, forced glycolysis-dependent
cancer cells into “metabolic catastrophe” [37]. PGC1α
is a transcription coactivator that interacts with several
nuclear receptors known to bind gluconeogenic promoters,
such as PPARs[38]. The degradation of PGC1α downregulated the gene expressions of PEPCK and G6Pase
[39]. And ERRs and PGC1α work in concert to regulate
mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolic pathways [40,
41]. We found that the cotransfection of PGC1α and
ERRα increased the expressions of FBPase and PEPCK;
and the cotransfection PGC1α with PPARγ upregulated
FBPase as well (Figure S7D and S7E). Although there
was little influence on the expressions of PPARγ, PGC1α
and ERRα. In THP-1 monocytes co-cultured with HCT116
cells (Figure S7C), lactate could bind with PPARγ and
affect it directly. Through molecular docking study, we
found lactate could not bind with PGC1α, and had quite
low binding activity with ERRα, but had a high and stable
affinity with the binding site between PGC1α and PPARγ
(Figure S7F). All these results suggested that HIF-1α
was not the unique factor affected by lactate in tumor
microenvironment. The search for the factors that be
modulated by lactate will provide infinite possibilities for
future cancer therapeutic approaches.
Lactate export and uptake is a MCT-dependent
process. The normoxic cells with oxidative potential
have the preference to express MCT 1; instead glycolytic/
hypoxic cells favor MCT4. Accordingly, MCT4 facilitates
the release of lactate from glycolytic cells [42, 43],
and MCT1 could primarily mediate lactate uptake by
oxygenated cells in tumors [8, 44]. Here, we found the
lactate uptake in THP-1 monocytes was dependent on
MCT1. So far, no specific small molecule inhibitor or
blocking antibody selective for MCT has been identified.
Due to the significance of lactate in cancer progression,
therapeutic agents targeting MCT1could exert multiple
anticancer influences. A first MCT1 inhibitor, AZD3965,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

is currently entering Phase I/II clinical trials for advanced
solid tumors [7] (http://science.cancerresearchuk.
org/). Although many of the biological activities of
lactic acid in tumors could be targeted therapeutically
with MCT inhibitors, most intrinsic activities of the
lactate anion remain to be identified, characterized and,
potentially, tailored for therapy. Recently, mTOR inhibitor
rapamycin was reported as a pharmacological inhibitor
of lactate generation in cancer cells[45]. Rapamycin
decreases lactate production independent of respiration
by suppressing mTOR-mediated activation of HIF1α[46]. Over production of lactate by tumors can lead
to fatal lactic acidosis in cancer patients [47]. Therefore,
rapamycin may be used to treat lactic acidosis both
in cancer patients. More importantly, over produced
lactate stromal cells or tumor cells could be inhibited
by rapamycin, resulting in the fail of energy-transfer
mechanism of feeding cancer cells. The modulation of
lactate in tumor microenvironment provides a new insight
for cancer therapy.
Tumor cells perform a metabolic switch to produce
intermediates for increased cell growth and division.
This appears to be a very early event in carcinogenesis,
at least in a significant number of cases observed so
far. On the basis of our current knowledge, it is too
early to draw firm conclusions about a causative role
of deregulated glycolysis in tumorigenesis. Here, we
demonstrated the energy-transfer mechanism of cancer
metabolism in inflammatory tumor microenvironment.
THP-1 monocytes recycle lactate to feed cancer cells with
glucose and PGE2 in favor of cancer progression. This
studies provide a potential relationship between metabolic
disorder and inflammatory. Trying to elucidate the “hen
and egg problem” in the sequence of inflammatory events,
metabolic deregulation, genetic alterations, and acquisition
of functional malignancy represents an exciting challenge
in experimental cancer research.

Cell culture

Western blotting

HCT116 cells and THP-1 monocytes were
respectively cultured in McCoy’s 5A medium (Sigma, St
Louis, MN) and RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, Carlsbad,
CA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco,
Carlsbad, CA), 100 U/mL benzyl penicillin and 100 μg/
mL streptomycin. Cells were cultured in a humidiﬁed
environment with 5% CO2 at 37°C.
For conditional culture of human THP-1 monocytes,
HCT116 cells were cultured as above for 48 h. Then the
condition medium (culture supernatants) were collected
and used to stimulate THP-1 monocytes for different times
(3, 6, 9, 12, 20, 24 h). THP-1 monocytes were cultured
alone as controls.
For co-culture of human colon cancer HCT116 cells
with human THP-1 monocytes, HCT116 cells were seeded
in 24-well plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) at a density of
4×104 cells per well and grown to 80% confluence. THP1 monocytes were collected by centrifugation (600 g for
10 min), washed, and added to the HCT116 cell culture
at 10:1 for 24 h using Milli hang culture well. THP-1
monocytes were cultured alone as controls.

Proteins were isolated using lysis buffer, incubated
in SDS buffer, separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and
electroblotted onto PVDF membranes. Immunoreactive
protein bands were detected using an Odyssey Scanning
System (LI-COR Inc., Superior St., Lincoln, NE, USA).
The following antibodies were used for Western blotting:

β-actin-sense
(5′-TCCTTCCTGGGCATGGAGTC-3′),
β-actin-antisense
(5′-TTCTGCATCCTGTCGGCAATG-3’).
The relative gene expressions were analyzed using
quantitative RT-PCR with β-actin as an internal control.

Lactic acid production
To determine the generation of lactic acid, medium
were collected and assayed following the manufacturer’s
instructions of the Lactic Acid production Detection kit
(KeyGen, Nanjing, China). The assay was detected using a
spectrophotometer (Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA) at 570
nm.

Glucose uptake assay
For the analysis of glucose uptake, the Amplex
Red Glucose Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR) was
used. Culture medium was collected and diluted 1:4000
in water. The amount of glucose in the medium was then
detected using the Amplex Red Assay according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The detection was performed
by spectrophotometer (Thermo, Waltham, MA) at Ex/Em
= 530 nm/590 nm.

Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy
Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in
PBS at 20 min intervals, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton
X-100, and blocked with 3% BSA for 30 min. Tissue
sections were heat fixed, deparaffinized and rehydrated
through a graded alcohol series (100%, 95%, 85%, 75%)
to distilled water. Tissue sections were boiled in citrate
buffer at high temperature for antigen retrieval, and
treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide to block endogenous
peroxidase activity. The slides were incubated with a
protein-blocking agent (kit 9710 MAIXIN, Maixin-Bio
Co., Fujian, China) prior to the application of the primary
antibody.

PGE2 Quantification
PGE2 level was determined in growth medium using
PGE2 ELISA kit (KeyGen, Nanjing, China) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Levels of cytokines were
expressed in pg/mL.

1α recombinant protein (0.8 μg/ sample, Abcam Ltd,
HK, China) or nuclear extracts (8 μg/sample) were
incubated with biotin-labeled oligonucleotides and
biotin-labeled mutant oligonucleotides (Sequences of the
oligonucleotides were listed in Figure S8D) in reaction
buffers, for 30 min at room temperature. DNA-protein
complexes were separated from free oligonucleotides on
6% native polyacrylamide gels. The gels were visualized
with the Bio-Rad Infrared system and quantified using
Image LabTM software (Bio-Rad, Berkeley, CA, USA).

Incubation with primary antibodies was done
overnight at 4°C. Then the nuclei were stained with
4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, Mo) 20 minutes before imaging. A laser scanning
confocal microscope FV10-ASW [Ver 2.1] (Olympus
Corp, MPE FV1000) was used for co-localization analysis.

Cell transfection and luciferase reporter assay
The transcriptional activities of HIF-1α to COX2 or
PEPCK were analyzed by luciferase reporter gene assays.
pGL3-Basic-COX2-luc plasmid and pGL3-Basic-PEPCKluc plasmid (Beyotime, Nantong, China) containing COX2
or PEPCK binding motifs (Sequences of the plasmids were
listed in Figure S3A and S3B) using the Lipofectamine
2000TM reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The luciferase reporter gene
plasmids were added to equalize the total amount of DNA
(4 μg/well in a 6-well plate) while the Renilla luciferase
reporter was used at 0.4 μg/well in a 6-well plate and
served as the normalization control. After 12 h, luciferase
assays were performed with the Luciferase Reporter Gene
Assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and detected
using Luminoskan ascent (Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA).

Colitis and colitis-associated cancer animal
models
Female and male C57BL/6 mice, 35-40 days old,
weighing 18-22 g, were supplied by Shanghai Laboratory
Animal Center, China Academy of Sciences (Certificate
No. 122). The mice were raised in air-conditioned rooms
under controlled lighting (12 h light/day) and provided
with food and water at discretion. Animal care and surgery
protocols were approved by the Animal Care Committee
of China Pharmaceutical University. All animals were
treated and used in a scientifically valid and ethical
manner. A total of 30 mice (male:female = 1:1) were
randomly divided into the following 3 groups (10 mice
/group): normal (negative control group), DSS (Colitis
group), and AOM/DSS (azoxymethane-based colitisassociated cancer, CAC group).
In the acute colitis model, mice were given 3.5%
DSS in drinking water for 7 days. DSS-treated groups
received 0.9% normal saline in a comparable volume by
the same route. Normal control mice received filtered
water alone. Mice were sacrificed on Day 7 and clinical
parameters and pathology were evaluated.
Colitis-associated cancer (CAC) was induced
as described previously [48]. Briefly, on day 1, mice in
carcinoma group were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with
12.5 mg/kg AOM (azoxymethane , Sigma, St Louis, MN)
and maintained on a regular diet and water for 5 days.
After 5 days, mice received 2.5% DSS (dextran sulfate
sodium, MP Biomedicals Inc., Irvine, CA) in drinking
water for 5 days. After this, mice were maintained on
regular water for 14 days and subjected to two more DSS
treatment cycles. Body weight was measured every week.
On day 95, mice were sacrificed.
In both the acute colitis and the CAC model the
mice were examined daily for behavior, water/food
consumption, body weight, stool consistency, and the
presence of gross blood in the stool or at the anus.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay
ChIP assay was performed following previously
published protocols with some modifications. Cells were
cross-linked with formaldehyde, quenched with glycine,
sonicated on ice and centrifuged at 4°C. Mixtures were
incubated with anti-COX2 or anti-PEPCK or pre-immune
IgG with rotation at 4°C overnight and then incubated
with Protein A/G Agarose at 4°C for 6 h. Finally, immune
complexes were captured by Protein A/G Agarose and
eluted with elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 M NaHCO3) at
37°C for 30 min. Cross-linking was reversed at 65°C for
4 h in a high salt buffer (0.2 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH
6.5, 10 mM EDTA, 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K). Extracted
and dissolved immunoprecipitated DNA was quantified
by real-time PCR with primers encompassing the COX2
or PEPCK binding sites. Primers for COX2 or PEPCK
promoter quantification were listed in Figure S8C.
An equal volume of non-precipitated (input) genomic
DNA was used to correct for the differences in PCR
amplification efficiencies and amounts of DNA. The PCR
analyses were performed using the Real-time PCR kit
(TaKaRa Biotechnology Co. Ltd., Dalian, China).

BALB/c nude mice (35–40 days old) with body weight
ranging from 18 to 22 g were supplied by the Academy
of Military Medical Sciences of the Chinese People’s
Liberation Army (Certificate No. SCXK-(Army) 2007004). Forty nude mice were randomly assigned to six
groups. Three of the groups were respectively injected
with Matrigel plug containing 100 μl 106 HCT116
cells suspension alone, or 100 μl 106 THP1 monocytes
suspension alone, or 200 μl suspension mixed with
HCT116 and THP1 cells (1:1), and 20 mM lactate. The
other three groups respectively injected with Matrigel plug
containing 100 μl 106 HCT116 cells suspension alone, or
100 μl 106 THP1 monocytes suspension alone, or 200 μl
suspension mixed with HCT116 and THP1 cells (1:1), and
lactate was replaced by an equal volume of saline. Tumor
growth was determined every 3 days. Longest and shortest
diameters were measured with an electronic caliper and
the formula of a prolate ellipsoid was used to calculate the
volume of the tumor. On day 21, mice were sacrificed. The
plugs were dissected and used for histological analysis and
immunohistochemistry assay as described below.

We used our protein-ligand docking software
package GOLD to dock lactate molecular into estrogenrelated receptor alpha (ERRα) or the bind site of
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma
(PPAR-γ) with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α), respectively.
Molecular docking was performed following the method
of Sun et al. (2010). We then ranked each protein according
to the GOLD fitness score. Molecular interactions were
observed using Discovery Studio (Accelrys, San Diego,
CA).

Statistical evaluation
Data are presented as mean ± SD from triplicate

Wound healing assay
The wound healing assay is used to study directional
cell migration in vitro. HCT116 cells were seeded in a
six-well plate and allowed to attach overnight to 80%
confluency. Subsequently, cell monolayers were wounded
by white pipette tips and washed with PBS twice to
remove floating cells. Cells were then co-cultured with
THP-1 monocytes or incubated in 200 nM PGE2 for 24
h. Cells migrated into the wound surface and the number
of migrating cells was determined under an inverted
