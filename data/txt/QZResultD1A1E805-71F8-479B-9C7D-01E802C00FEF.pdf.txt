Abstract
T-cell inﬁltration is known to impact tumor growth and is associated with cancer patient survival. However, the
molecular cues that favor T-cell inﬁltration remain largely undeﬁned. Here, using a genetically engineered mouse
model of melanoma, we show that CXCR3 ligands and CCL5 synergize to attract effector T cells into cutaneous
metastases, and their expression inhibits tumor growth. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with chemotherapy
induced intratumoral expression of these chemokines and favored T-cell inﬁltration into cutaneous tumors. In
patients with melanoma, these chemokines were also upregulated in chemotherapy-sensitive lesions following
chemotherapy, and correlated with T-cell inﬁltration, tumor control, and patient survival. We found that
dacarbazine, temozolomide, and cisplatin induced expression of T-cell–attracting chemokines in several human
melanoma cell lines in vitro. These data identify the induction of intratumoral expression of chemokines as a novel
cell-extrinsic mechanism of action of chemotherapy that results in the recruitment of immune cells with
antitumor activity. Therefore, identifying chemotherapeutic drugs able to induce the expression of T-cell–
attracting chemokines in cancer cells may represent a novel strategy to improve the efﬁcacy of cancer
immunotherapy. Cancer Res; 71(22); 6997–7009. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
T-cell inﬁltration is a known predictor of patient survival in
several cancers, including colorectal and ovarian cancers, non–
small cell lung carcinomas, and melanomas (1–5). T-cell–
adoptive therapies represent an attractive approach to treating
cancers and have yielded some promising results in melanoma,
even though complete clinical responses are only observed in a
minority of patients (6). Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration approved the ﬁrst therapeutic cancer vaccine
(sipuleucel-T) for advanced prostate cancer (7). However, even
when cancer vaccines induce immune responses in the majority of patients, only a few beneﬁt from the treatment (8, 9). This

antitumor immune responses, whether spontaneous or
induced, is the most disturbing paradox of tumor immunology
(10). The so far limited success of therapeutic cancer vaccines
is largely due to our incomplete understanding of the mechanisms preventing the action of T cells locally. T-cell recruitment
to the tumor is one of the potential rate-limiting steps in
immunotherapy, and thus, intratumoral chemokines are likely
to have a major impact (11, 12). Gene expression proﬁling
studies have shown that intratumoral expression of chemokines, indeed, correlate with T-cell inﬁltration (13). Therefore,
identifying drugs that favor T-cell trafﬁcking to the tumors is
essential to improve cancer vaccines.
Chemotherapy acts, in part, by direct induction of apoptosis
in cancer cells. In addition, selected chemotherapies may
promote immunogenic cell death, which stimulates the antitumor immune response (14). Chemotherapy can also induce
stress signals leading to increased susceptibility of cancer cells
to immune attack (15). In melanoma, mixed responses to
chemotherapy are frequently observed (16). Therefore, we
sought to understand the signals responsible for T-cell trafﬁcking to cutaneous tumors in melanoma and to determine
whether they are altered by chemotherapy.
We recently described the RETAAD model of melanoma
(17). RETAAD mice develop spontaneous uveal melanomas
that metastasize to the skin and visceral organs (18). Tumorbearing animals mount a strong antitumor T-cell response, but
although this response controls the outgrowth of visceral
metastases, they have no effect on cutaneous tumors. We

suspected that differential T-cell trafﬁcking might explain this
apparent paradox. Using global transcriptome analysis, we also
analyzed cutaneous metastases resected from patients with
melanoma before and after chemotherapy and found increased
T-cell inﬁltration into the chemotherapy-sensitive tumors (19).
The aim of this study is to identify molecular cues controlling T-cell inﬁltration into cutaneous tumors and to ﬁnd
treatments promoting T-cell inﬁltration. We address this
question in the RETAAD model and in patients with melanoma
treated with chemotherapy. Our ﬁndings indicate that chemotherapy works, in part, through the induction of chemokine
expression in cancer cells and the subsequent recruitment of T
cells into the tumors.

Construction of expression plasmids
CCL5- and CXCL9-expressing plasmids are described in
Supplementary Fig. S3. Brieﬂy, RNA from lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages was reverse transcribed, PCR
ampliﬁed using speciﬁc primers for Ccl5 (50 -primer
TACCGAGCTCGGATCCATGAAGATCTCTGCAGCTG; 30 -primer AAACGGGCCCTCTAGAGCAGGGTCAGAATCAAGAAACC),
and Cxcl9 (50 -primer TACCGAGCTCGGATCCGCCACCATGAAGTCCGCTGTTC; 30 -primer GCCCTCTAGACTCGAGCTCTTATGTAGTCTTCCTTG). PCR products were cloned into
pcDNA3.1 Hygro(þ; Invitrogen) at BamHI/XbaI sites (for Ccl5)
and at BamHI/XhoI sites (for Cxcl9). Chemokine-expressing and
control plasmid preparations were tested for endotoxin using
Limulus amebocyte lysate assay (Lonza, 50-647U).

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and antibodies
The B16-F10 (Cat Nr CRL-6475) and HTB-71 cell lines were
from American Type Culture Collection. The Melan-ret cell
line was previously described (20). The 4 human melanoma
cell lines (M88, M102, M131, and M134) were kindly provided
by J-B Latouche and P. Musette. The anti-CXCR3 antibody
was produced by immunizing CXCR3-deﬁcient mice with
L1.2 cells expressing mouse CXCR3, as described previously
(21).
Mice and patients
Animal care and experimental procedures were approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the
Biological Resource Center, A STAR, Singapore. Human tumor
samples, patient demographics, and clinical characteristics
can be found in Nardin and colleagues (19).
Gene expression analysis
Expression of immune genes relative to Gapdh (for mouse)
and ACTB (for human) was measured by quantitative real-time
PCR (qRT-PCR) as previously described (18). DCt and primer
efﬁciency were used to calculate the relative expression.
Expression of chemokine and chemokine receptor genes
was determined by qRT-PCR with the Mouse Inﬂammatory
Cytokines and Receptors RT2 proﬁler PCR array system
(SABiosciences), and data analysis was conducted according
to the manufacturer's instructions.
Immunoﬂuorescence
Formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded sections (5 mm) were
immunolabeled for CD3 (Acris SM1754P; 1:50) using the protocol previously described (18).
Flow cytometry analyses
Single-cell suspensions were obtained by digestion with
Collagenase A (1 mg/mL) and DNase I (0.1 mg/mL; Roche) in
RPMI for 20 minutes. After red blood cell lysis, Fc receptors
were blocked with anti-mouse CD16/CD32 for 30 minutes
before incubation with antigen-speciﬁc antibodies at 1:50
dilution for 20 minutes. All antibodies were from Biolegend,
except those speciﬁc for CCR1, CCR2, and CCR5 which were
from R&D Systems.

In vivo experiments
RETAAD T-cell migration to skin tumors. Tumor-bearing RETAAD mice (aged between 30 and 50 weeks) were
injected subcutaneously in the right ﬂank with 2  105 B16F10luc cells (Xenogen). Mice were euthanized when the tumor
diameter reached 1 cm. The B16 transplanted skin tumor and 1
or 2 RETAAD skin tumors were collected from the same mouse.
T-cell inﬁltration into tumors was measured by ﬂow
cytometry.
In vivo transfection of cutaneous tumors
Tumor-bearing RETAAD mice (30–50 weeks) were used. For
each mouse, 2 to 7 cutaneous tumors were transfected with 5
mg of pcDNA3.1(þ)-CCL5 or pcDNA3.1(þ)-CXCL9 or empty
plasmid using in vivo JetPEI transfecting reagent (Polyplus
Transfection). The mice were injected 3 times on alternate days
for 5 days. On day 6, the mice were euthanized and the tumors
excised, weighed, and divided into 2 parts. One part was used
for intratumoral mRNA expression of Ccl5, Cxcl9, Cxcl10, Ifng,
Gzma, and Gzmb by qRT-PCR; the other was dissociated and
analyzed for immune cell inﬁltration by ﬂow cytometry. For
Ccl5 and Cxcl9 coinjection studies, 2.5 mg of pcDNA3.1
(þ)-CCL5, pcDNA3.1(þ)-CXCL9, empty plasmid, or a combination of 5 mg of pcDNA3.1(þ)-CCL5 and pcDNA3.1(þ)-CXCL9
were injected into cutaneous RETAAD tumors using the
protocol described previously. T-cell inﬁltration and intratumoral chemokine expression were measured as previously
described.
Chemotherapy and adoptive transfer
Rag1/ mice were injected subcutaneously with 106 Melanret cells. When tumors became palpable, mice were treated for
2 consecutive days with 2 mg temozolomide or vehicle
[dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)] only. On the following day, mice
were injected intravenously with 107 in vitro activated T cells
puriﬁed from C57BL/6 with or without 2 mg anti-CXCR3
antibody. T-cell inﬁltration and intratumoral expression of
chemokines were measured 24 hours after transfer.
Chemotherapeutic drug treatment and chemokine gene
expression
Human melanoma cells were seeded into 12-well plates
(4  105 per well). Forty-eight hours later, drugs were added

at indicated concentrations. RNA extraction was conducted as
described previously, and the expression of CCL5, CXCL9, and
CXCL10 was analyzed by qRT-PCR.
Multiplex analysis of chemokine/cytokine production by
tumor cells
Concentrations of various cytokines/chemokines in the
supernatant of drug-treated cells were analyzed using multiplex bead-based assays based on xMAP technology, combining
both the 21-plex (MF0-005KMII) and 27-plex (M50-0KCAF0Y)
kits from Bio-Rad and according to the manufacturer's
protocol.

Results
Limited T-cell inﬁltration of cutaneous tumors
In RETAAD mice, CD8þ T cells control the outgrowth of
visceral metastases but have no effect on cutaneous tumors
(Lengagne and colleagues, 2008 and Supplementary Fig. S1).
We hypothesized that the lack of control of skin tumors by T
cells results from the absence of T-cell inﬁltration or from the
loss of function of inﬁltrating T cells. To measure T-cell
inﬁltration, we collected 22 cutaneous and 4 visceral metastases from RETAAD mice and compared the density of CD3þ T
cells by ﬂow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 1A, the median
percentage of CD3þ T cells was 2.7 times higher in visceral
metastases than in cutaneous tumors (2-tailed Mann–Whitney, P ¼ 0.04). Immunoﬂuorescent staining of tumor sections
conﬁrmed that T cells were more abundant in visceral tumors

Statistical analyses
Normalized gene expression data were log-transformed
and initially compared using a manova multivariate analysis.
This was followed by post-hoc testing using Student t test or
ANOVA. P values for multiple comparisons were adjusted
using Bonferroni correction. Other parameters (tumor
weight, tumor area, and percentage of tumor-inﬁltrating
cells) were compared using nonparametric tests (Mann–

(14.5 vs. 4.5 cells/ﬁeld of view; 2-tailed Mann–Whitney, P ¼
0.0007; Fig. 1B, right). Using qRT-PCR, we were able to analyze a
greater number of tumors, especially smaller ones. In a preliminary experiment, we veriﬁed that intratumoral expression
of Cd3g faithfully reﬂected T-cell inﬁltration (Pearson's r ¼
0.75, P < 0.0001, linear regression slope ¼ 0.927; Supplementary
Fig. S6A). qRT-PCR analysis revealed that markers of T cells
(Cd3g, Cd4, Cd8a, Ifng, Prf1b, and Gzmb) were less expressed in
cutaneous metastases (n ¼ 20), conﬁrming that there were
fewer inﬁltrating T cells compared with visceral metastases (n
¼ 10; 1-tailed t test, P ¼ 0.001; Fig. 1C). Expression of both Cd4
and Cd8a was lower in cutaneous tumors, suggesting that both
compartments were affected (P ¼ 0.026 and 0.023, respectively). Tumor weights were inversely correlated with the percentages of CD3þ, CD4þ, and CD8þ inﬁltrating cells (Pearson's
r ¼ 0.67, 0.58, and 0.64 and P ¼ 0.009, 0.02, and 0.01,
respectively), suggesting that the few inﬁltrating T cells were
able to control tumor growth (Fig. 1D).
Taken together, these data show that both CD4þ and CD8þ
T cells poorly inﬁltrate cutaneous tumors in RETAAD mice.
This observation is likely to explain the lack of T cell control
over cutaneous tumors.
T cells inﬁltrate exogenous skin tumors
To determine whether the poor inﬁltration of T cells into
cutaneous tumors was due to an intrinsic defect in T cells from
RETAAD mice or a feature of the tumors themselves, we
compared autochthonous RETAAD and transplanted B16
cutaneous tumors. B16 cells were injected subcutaneously
into tumor-bearing RETAAD mice. Fourteen days after injection, the transplanted B16 and autochthonous RETAAD
tumors were excised and T-cell inﬁltration was measured. As
shown in Fig. 2A, CD3þ, CD4þ, and CD8þ T cells were,
respectively, 11-fold, 9-fold, and 11-fold more abundant in
B16 than in RETAAD tumors (2-tailed Mann–Whitney,
P < 0.01).
These data show that T cells from RETAAD mice have the
capacity to inﬁltrate cutaneous tumors. Therefore, the paucity
of T cells in RETAAD cutaneous tumors is most likely due to the
tumor environment being poorly permissive to T-cell
inﬁltration.
T-cell inﬁltration of exogenous skin tumors correlates
with high chemokine expression
Chemokines present in tumors are likely to play a major
role in T-cell recruitment. Therefore, we compared the
repertoire of chemokines expressed in autochthonous
RETAAD tumors and transplanted B16 tumors grown in
RETAAD mice using low-density PCR arrays. Thirty-nine
genes, including 26 chemokines and 13 chemokine receptors, involved in inﬂammation were analyzed by qRT-PCR.
As shown in Fig. 2B, 14 of the 26 chemokines analyzed were
differentially expressed in transplanted B16 compared with
autochthonous RETAAD tumors (open squares; P < 0.05, fold
change > 2), with the vast majority of these chemokines (12
of 14) being more highly expressed in B16 tumors. Cxcl9 and
Cxcl10 were the two most differentially expressed chemokines, with 105- and 42-fold greater expression in B16

7000

tumors, respectively. Five additional chemokines, Ccl2, Ccl3,
Ccl4, Ccl7, and Cxcl5 were at least 10-fold more highly
expressed in B16 tumors than in autochthonous RETAAD
tumors.
To gain further insight into the possible role of these
differentially expressed chemokines in T-cell recruitment, we
analyzed the expression of the corresponding chemokine
receptors on peripheral blood T cells from RETAAD mice.
CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, CCR5, and CXCR3 expressions were analyzed by ﬂow cytometry on naive, central memory, and effector
memory T cells. The chemokine receptor CXCR3 was highly
expressed by several subsets of circulating T cells, whereas
CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5 were only expressed at marginal levels
(Fig. 2C). CCR2 was expressed by 25%  2% of effector memory
CD4þ T cells. CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, and CCR5 were highly
expressed on various subsets of myeloid cells (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Within the CD4þ T cells, 4%  1.9% of the central
memory and 58%  10% of the effector memory cells expressed
CXCR3 (Fig. 2D), whereas among the CD8þ T-cell population,
93%  3.6% of the central memory and 75%  5.7% of the
effector memory cells expressed CXCR3.
CXCR3 has only 3 known ligands: CXCL9, CXCL10, and
CXCL11. Therefore, our data strongly suggest a role for CXCL9
and CXCL10 in T-cell recruitment into cutaneous tumors.
Transfection of RETAAD skin tumors with Cxcl9 induces
T-cell inﬁltration
To directly show the role of CXCR3 ligands in T-cell recruitment, we transfected established RETAAD autochthonous
tumors with a plasmid encoding CXCL9. RETAAD mice bearing multiple cutaneous metastases (median weight ¼ 60 mg)
were selected for this experiment. The mice received three
intratumoral injections on alternate days. In each mouse, 1 or
2 tumors were injected with the CXCL9-encoding plasmid and
1 or 2 tumors were injected with a control plasmid. On day 6,
tumors were excised, weighed, and T-cell inﬁltration was
assessed by ﬂow cytometry. As shown in Supplementary Fig.
S4A, injection of the CXCL9-encoding plasmid induced a 60fold increase in intratumoral expression of Cxcl9 measured by
qRT-PCR at day 6. Expression of Cxcl10 was not affected.
Importantly, CXCL9 transfection resulted in a 6-fold increase
in both CD4þ and CD8þ T-cell inﬁltration into RETAAD
cutaneous tumors (1-tailed Mann–Whitney, P ¼ 0.0026 and
0.0025, respectively; Fig. 3A). Injection of the control plasmid
did not signiﬁcantly alter the T-cell inﬁltrate (Supplementary
Fig. S4B).
To characterize CXCL9-recruited T cells, we analyzed the
expression of several effector molecules by qRT-PCR. The
expression of Ifng, Gzma, and Gzmb was enhanced in
CXCL9-treated tumors compared with control tumors by 7-,
5-, and 5-fold, respectively (1-tailed t test, P ¼ 0.006, 0.01, and
0.02, respectively; Fig. 3B). Moreover, using ﬂow cytometry, we
detected a 43% increase in tumor cell death (1-tailed Mann–
Whitney, P ¼ 0.03) in treated tumors compared with control
tumors (Fig. 3C).
Taken together, these observations show that CXCL9
attracts effector T cells exhibiting type 1 polarization and
cytotoxic potential.

Mice were euthanized at day 16, tumors were collected and

multiple comparison posttest. H, surface expression of CCR5 on CD4þ and CD8þ T cells in peripheral blood (n ¼ 6) and TIL (n ¼ 16). Mann–Whitney U test,
1-tailed. All data are representative of 3 independent experiments conducted. Statistical differences between groups are represented by    , P < 0.001;

, P < 0.01;  , P < 0.05; ns, nonsigniﬁcant. C, control plasmid; Tr, tumors injected with the Cxcl9 plasmid; Tf, Melan-ret transfected with Cxcl9 plasmid.

Cxcl9-expressing Melan-ret tumors were on average 10 times
smaller (1-tailed Mann–Whitney, P ¼ 0.004; mean weight ¼
0.14 g vs. 0.014 g) than control tumors (Fig. 3D), and this was
associated with a 4-fold increase in Cxcl9 expression and a 3fold increase in Cd3g expression (Fig. 3E). When the same
experiment was repeated in Rag1/ mice, there was no
signiﬁcant difference in the growth of Cxcl9-transfected and
control tumors (Fig. 3F). These data show that Cxcl9 expression
inhibits tumor growth and that this inhibition is dependent on
a lymphoid cell population.
CXCL9 synergizes with CCL5 to recruit T cells
Knowing that CXCL9 promotes T-cell recruitment and
that chemokines often act in concert, we then asked whether
other chemokines expressed in RETAAD tumors were also
involved in T-cell inﬁltration. By comparing a set of 37 cutaneous or visceral tumors, we found that Ccl5 expression was
highly correlated with Cd3g expression (Pearson's r ¼ 0.65,

7002

Cancer Res; 71(22) November 15, 2011

P ¼ 4.75e-6; Supplementary Fig. S5). Surprisingly, RETAAD
circulating T cells express very low levels of the known receptors of CCL5, namely, CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5 (Fig. 2C). Therefore, secretion of CCL5 by the T cells may account for the
observed correlation. Alternatively, CCL5 might play a role in Tcell attraction, for example, by synergizing with CXCR3 ligands.
To test the latter hypothesis, RETAAD cutaneous tumors were
transfected with a plasmid encoding CCL5 alone, CXCL9 alone,
or a combination of both plasmids. Suboptimal doses of the
CXCL9 plasmid were used. The mice were injected 3 times on
alternate days for 5 days. On day 6, the tumors were harvested,
weighed, and analyzed for CD3þ T-cell inﬁltration by cytometry and qRT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 3G, treatment with CCL5
plasmid alone did not lead to enhanced T-cell inﬁltration.
Similarly, treatment with suboptimal doses of CXCL9 plasmid
had only a marginal effect. However, the combination of both
CCL5 and CXCL9 resulted in a synergistic increase in T-cell
inﬁltration (1-way Kruskal–Wallis, P ¼ 0.03) and Cd3g

expression within the tumors (1-way ANOVA, P < 0.0001). This
synergistic effect was observed for both CD4þ and CD8þ T cells
(Supplementary Fig. S6B).
This increased inﬁltration of T cells in tumors coinjected
with CCL5 and CXCL9 plasmids was not due to CCL5-mediated
increase in CXCL9 production (data not shown). Conversely,
T cells may undergo changes in chemokine receptor expression
upon inﬁltration into the tumor. Therefore, we compared
CCR5 expression on tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes (TIL;
n ¼ 16) and blood lymphocytes (n ¼ 6). Interestingly, we
detected a small but reproducible increase in the percentage of
CCR5-expressing CD4þ and CD8þ (40% and 80% increase,
respectively) in TIL compared with blood lymphocytes
(Fig. 3H).
Altogether, these data show a synergy between CXCL9 and
CCL5 for T-cell recruitment and suggest that CCR5 upregulation in the tumor microenvironment may favor T-cell retention
in CCL5-expressing tumors.
Chemotherapy induces chemokine production in human
melanoma cell lines
Chemotherapy is known to alter the transcriptome of
cancer cells and has been reported to modify their proﬁle
of chemokine secretion (22). Therefore, we tested 3 chemotherapeutic drugs commonly used to treat stage IV melanoma (temozolomide, cisplatin, and dacarbazine), for their
ability to induce T-cell–attracting chemokines in vitro. Five
human melanoma cell lines (HTB-71, M88, M102, M131, and
M134) were included in the study. Transcription of the CCL5,
CXCL9, and CXCL10 genes was measured by qRT-PCR 72
hours after drug treatment. As shown in Fig. 4A, each drug
and each cell line displayed a unique pattern of chemokine
expression; at least 2 T-cell–attracting chemokines were
actively transcribed in all cell lines after treatment with at
least one drug. Temozolomide strongly induced all 3 chemokines in M102 and M134, and CXCL10 in HTB-71 and
M131 (>10-fold increase). Cisplatin induced all 3 chemokines
in M102 but only the CXCR3 ligands in M134 and CXCL10 in
M88. Dacarbazine induced all 3 chemokines in HTB-71.
Dose–response relationships were observed for temozolomide and cisplatin (Fig. 4B), but no reproducible dose–
response relationships were observed for dacarbazine. This
is likely due to the fact that dacarbazine requires conversion
into the active metabolite 5-(3-methyltriazen-1-yl)imidazole-4-carboxamide, which relies on spontaneous catalytic
reaction in vitro whereas liver enzymatic activity carries out
this step in vivo. Therefore, we focused on temozolomide
(which shares the same active metabolite as dacarbazine)
and cisplatin for the rest of the study. Figure 4C shows the
kinetics of CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10 induction in M102 cells
following treatment with 100 mg/mL temozolomide. Transcription of CXCL10 was detectable as soon as 24 hours after
treatment, whereas CXCL9 and CCL5 transcription was only
detected at 48 and 72 hours. Under these experimental
conditions, cell death was not observed before 48 hours,
showing that CXCL10 transcription preceded cell death. In
fact, for lower concentrations of temozolomide, CXCL9 and
CCL5 expression also preceded cell death (data not shown).

We conﬁrmed that CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10 mRNA were
translated into proteins by analyzing supernatants of M102
cells 72 hours after treatment with temozolomide (100 mg/mL)
or cisplatin (10 mg/mL). Using ELISA and Luminex-based BioPlex suspension arrays, culture supernatants were tested for a
variety of secreted proteins, including 28 cytokines, 7 additional chemokines, and 10 angiogenic and growth factors. As
shown in Fig. 4D, temozolomide induced more than 9-fold
increase in the secretion of 5 chemokines (CCL2, CCL5, CXCL8,
CXCL9, and CXCL10) and 1 chemokine-like factor (MIF),
whereas cisplatin induced CXCL8, CXCL10, and MIF. Importantly, none of the other factors was signiﬁcantly induced
(Table 1).
Altogether, these data show that 3 chemotherapeutic drugs
commonly used for the treatment of human metastatic melanoma induce speciﬁc expression of chemokines involved in Tcell attraction.
Enhanced chemokine expression and T-cell inﬁltration
in cutaneous tumors from mice treated with
temozolomide
We next determined whether chemotherapy could facilitate
intratumoral T-cell inﬁltration by inducing chemokine expression in cutaneous tumors. Rag1/ mice bearing subcutaneous
Melan-ret tumors were ﬁrst treated with temozolomide and
then adoptively transferred with in vitro activated T cells.
Tumors were collected and analyzed for chemokine expression
by qRT-PCR and T-cell inﬁltration by cytometry. As shown
in Fig. 5A, temozolomide treatment induced signiﬁcant upregulation of Ccl5, Cxcl9, and Cxcl10 (1-tailed t test, P ¼ 0.01, 0.02,
and 0.0003, respectively). Importantly, this enhanced chemokine expression was associated with a more than 50% increase
in CD3þ T-cell inﬁltration. Moreover, this increase was
completely suppressed by anti-CXCR3 blocking antibody. This
indicates that temozolomide-induced chemokines are functional and are able to attract T cells into cutaneous tumors.
Enhanced expression of CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10 after
chemotherapy is associated with tumor control and
superior survival of patients with melanoma
We previously showed increased T-cell inﬁltration in chemotherapy-sensitive tumors of patients with melanoma treated with dacarbazine (19). In the previous study, we carried out
global transcriptome analysis of 33 cutaneous metastases
resected before or after chemotherapy. We now reanalyzed
these data, asking whether there were any chemokine whose
expression correlated with T-cell inﬁltration. Among all the
genes coding for chemokines, CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10 were
the most signiﬁcantly correlated with CD3Z and CD8A expression, and among the most signiﬁcantly correlated with CD4
(Fig. 6A). We next compared CD4 and CD8A expression in 3
categories of tumor samples: those that expressed low levels of
the 3 chemokines, those that expressed high levels of CCL5 or
high levels of CXCR3 ligands, and those that expressed high
levels of CCL5 and high levels of at least 1 CXCR3 ligand. This
comparison revealed a clear synergy between CCL5 and CXCR3
ligands for T-cell inﬁltration (Fig. 6B). To determine whether
chemotherapy had any impact on chemokine expression, we

Figure 4. Chemotherapeutic drugs induce chemokine expression in human melanoma cells in vitro. Temozolomide, cisplatin, and dacarbazine were tested on 5
different human melanoma cell lines (HTB-71, M88, M102, M131, and M134) for their effect on CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10 production. A, CCL5, CXCL9, and
CXCL10 expression was measured by qRT-PCR in cells treated with either temozolomide (100 mg/mL), cisplatin (10 mg/mL), or dacarbazine (100 mg/mL) for 72
hours. Data show the fold change in chemokine expression in drug-treated cells over control cells. B, M102 cells were treated with increasing dose of
temozolomide (0, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 mg/mL) or cisplatin (0, 1.3, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/mL) for 72 hours and the expression of CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10
was measured by qRT-PCR. Comparisons were done using 2-way ANOVA. C, kinetics of CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10 expression in M102 cells at 6, 12, 24,

of 40 different cytokines, chemokines, angiogenic factors, and growth factors in the supernatants of drug-treated and control cells were determined using
multiplex immunobeads technology. Data are presented as fold change in protein production from drug-treated cells compared with control cells. Only

compared CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10 expression in tumors
before and after therapy. As shown in Fig. 6C, whereas dacarbazine did not induce any signiﬁcant changes in chemotherapy-resistant tumors, that is, progressing lesions, an increase in
CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10 expression was observed after
treatment in chemotherapy-sensitive tumors (1-tailed t test,
P ¼ 0.006, 0.017, and 0.041, respectively). CD4 and CD8A
expression was also signiﬁcantly increased in chemotherapy-sensitive tumors (P ¼ 0.0004 and 0.0009, respectively;

Fig. 6D). Manova multivariate analysis showed that chemokines and T-cell markers were signiﬁcant predictors of the
response to chemotherapy (Wilks test, P ¼ 0.0014). Post-hoc
tests showed that expression levels of CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL5,
CD4, and CD8A were all signiﬁcant predictors of tumor
response (P ¼ 0.00022, 0.00024, 3.2e-5, 4.1e-5, and 2.7e-5,
respectively). Finally, Kaplan–Meier analysis showed that
patients exhibiting higher chemokine expression after chemotherapy survived longer (P ¼ 0.0002; HR ¼ 35; Fig. 6E).

Taken together, these data show that chemotherapy induces
enhanced expression of CXCR3 ligands and CCL5 in chemotherapy-sensitive tumors. Furthermore, increased expression
of these chemokines translates into enhanced T-cell inﬁltration, improved tumor control, and prolonged overall survival.

Discussion
In this study, we show that CXCR3 ligands and CCL5 are the
main determinants of T-cell inﬁltration into cutaneous melanoma tumors. Moreover, we show that chemotherapy induces
expression of these chemokines in human melanoma cell lines
and that chemotherapy-induced chemokines correlate with Tcell inﬁltration in mouse and human melanoma tumors.
Finally, chemotherapy-induced chemokines is associated with
tumor control and prolonged patient survival.
Although antitumor T cells are often detected in the blood
of patients with melanoma, their presence only rarely translates into favorable clinical outcome (23). This applies to
spontaneous T-cell responses as well as those induced by
cancer vaccines; the vast majority of patients with cancer
undergoing therapeutic vaccination have enhanced antitumor
T-cell responses, but only a small percentage control their
tumors. Several explanations have been proposed for this
apparent paradox, including local immune suppression, tumor
immune editing, and escape from immune attack (reviewed in
ref. 24). In RETAAD mice, we found that the main reason why T
cells do not control cutaneous tumors is because they fail to
trafﬁc to these tumors. We previously showed that cutaneous
tumors are not immune-edited: resected cutaneous tumors are
recognized ex vivo by antimelanoma T cells (17); moreover,
CD8þ T cells retain their functionality in vivo and control
visceral metastases (18). We now show that very few T cells
inﬁltrate RETAAD skin tumors in comparison with the
RETAAD visceral tumors or transplanted B16 skin tumors.
The few T cells that inﬁltrate RETAAD skin tumors apparently
retain their functionality because their density correlates
inversely with tumor size. Moreover, transduction of CXCR3
ligands and CCL5 into the cutaneous tumors results in

7006

Cancer Res; 71(22) November 15, 2011

increased T-cell inﬁltration and reduced tumor growth. In
patients with melanoma, tumor regressions have been
observed with similar frequencies of tumor-inﬁltrating T cells
(25, 26). Therefore in this model, differential T-cell trafﬁcking is
the main reason for tissue-speciﬁc control of metastases.
Importantly, we extended this ﬁnding to cutaneous tumors
from patients with melanoma treated by chemotherapy. In
these patients, tumor control and prolonged survival are
positively associated with increased T-cell inﬁltration and
intratumoral expression of CXCR3 ligands and CCL5.
Several correlative studies have highlighted the importance of CCL5 and CXCR3 ligands in the progression of
cutaneous melanoma. Harlin and colleagues identiﬁed several chemokines whose expression is associated with CD8þ
T-cell inﬁltration; however, this study did not distinguish
between chemokines that attract T cells and those that are
produced by T cells (13). In patients with stage III disease,
expression of CXCR3 by circulating memory T cells correlates with prolonged survival (27). IFN-a, a known inducer of
CXCL9 and CXCL10, is approved for adjuvant treatment of
high-risk (stages IIb and III) cutaneous melanoma (28, 29).
On the basis of our data, it is tempting to speculate that
induction of CXCR3 ligands participates in the antimelanoma activity of IFN-a. Expression of CXCL10 by peripheral
blood mononuclear cell of patients with melanoma has been
reported to correlate with tumor control (30). Interestingly,
CXCR3 expression in cutaneous melanoma correlates negatively with lymphocyte inﬁltration (31). The mechanism
underlying this correlation is unclear but this study suggests
that cancer cells expressing CXCR3 might escape the
immune response by competing for chemokines able to
attract T cells. Expression of a nonfunctional allele of CCR5
results in decreased survival of patients with melanoma
receiving immunotherapy (32). CXCR3 ligands and CCL5
have also been involved in other types of cancer, including
colorectal and Ewing's sarcoma (33, 34).
Our study also reveals a striking synergism between CXCR3
ligands and CCL5 in attracting T cells into melanoma tumors of
both humans and mice. At this stage, the exact mechanism

Chemotherapy-Induced T-cell Attraction

Figure 6. Enhanced chemokine expression in human melanoma skin tumors after chemotherapy correlates with increased T-cell inﬁltration, tumor control, and
patient survival. A total of 33 cutaneous melanoma tumors from 13 stage III or IV patients were collected before and after chemotherapy. Gene expression
was measured by qRT-PCR. A, CD4 or CD8A expression correlates with CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10 expression in the tumors. Spearman correlation, 1-tailed
with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. B, the expression of CD4 and CD8A was compared between tumors with high or low expression of CCL5 and

expression of CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCR3 as well as CD4 and CD8A was compared between cutaneous tumors before (pre; n ¼ 13) and after chemotherapy
(post; n ¼ 22). Tumors collected after treatment were divided into chemotherapy resistant (CT-R; n ¼ 12) or chemotherapy sensitive (CT-S; n ¼ 10). Differential
gene expression between tumor samples collected before treatment and chemotherapy-sensitive tumors was assessed by 1-tailed t test on log-transformed
expression values. E, Kaplan–Meier analysis of patient survival with high- or low- intratumoral chemokine expression after chemotherapy. Statistical

accounting for this synergy is unclear because circulating T
cells only express very low levels of CCL5 receptors. In fact, less
than 2% of CD8þ T cells in the RETAAD mice express CCL5
receptors. CCL5 transfection did not enhance CXCL9 expression in the tumor and transfection of CCL5 alone has no effect
on T-cell attraction. However, we did observe an increased
percentage of CD4þ and CD8þ T cells expressing CCR5 among
the TIL, suggesting either that CCR5-expressing T cells are
preferentially attracted into the tumor or that upon inﬁltration, T cells upregulate CCR5. We propose that intratumoral
expression of CCL5 might facilitate the retention of CCR5expressing T cells, thereby augmenting the percentage of
CCR5þ TIL. We could not directly test this hypothesis in
patients with melanoma, but we did ﬁnd that intratumoral

expression of CXCR3 ligands and CCL5 in chemotherapytreated tumors does lead to a synergistic increase in T-cell
inﬁltration.
This study provides evidence for a novel mode of action of
chemotherapeutic drugs. First, we show that dacarbazine,
cisplatin, and temozolomide induce expression of T-cell–
attracting chemokines in several melanoma cell lines. Transcription of CCL5, CXCL9, and/or CXCL10 was induced in all
tested cell lines, even though each cell line displayed a unique
proﬁle of response to the chemotherapeutic drugs. Timecourse experiments showed that under most experimental
conditions tested, transcription of the chemokine genes preceded cell death. Secretion of the chemokines was conﬁrmed
for one of the cell lines. Chemokine induction was highly

speciﬁc because of 48 soluble factors analyzed, only 5 chemokines and 1 chemokine-like factor were signiﬁcantly induced
by temozolomide; whereas only 2 chemokines and 1 chemokine-like factor were induced by cisplatin. Treatment of tumorbearing mice with temozolomide also induced intratumoral
chemokine expression and CXCR3-dependent T-cell inﬁltration. Chemotherapies are known to alter the cancer cell
transcriptome (reviewed in ref. 35). By damaging the tumor
and stimulating a wound healing response, chemotherapy may
also induce epithelial–mesenchymal transition and favor the
outgrowth of cells with higher motility and invasiveness (36); it
may also select drug-resistant cells with stem cell and metastasis-initiating properties (37). Levina and colleagues previously reported that in vitro treatment of some human cancer
cell lines with doxorubicin or cisplatin induces expression of
several cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, which
protect the cancer cells from drug-induced apoptosis (22).
These previous reports identiﬁed cancer cell alterations that
limit chemotherapy-induced cell death. By showing that chemotherapy can alter cancer cell phenotype in a way that
favorably impacts immune cell trafﬁcking to the tumor, this
study reveals a novel mechanism of action of common chemotherapeutic agents. Chemotherapy induces clinical
responses in about 20% of patients with melanoma (16). In
our limited cohort, tumor regression or stabilization was
observed in 6 of 13 patients and 11 of 20 tumors resected
after chemotherapy. Remarkably, enhanced expression of
CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10 after chemotherapy correlated

with tumor response. Importantly, prolonged patient survival
was associated with enhanced chemokine expression after
chemotherapy.
In conclusion, this study identiﬁes CXCR3 ligands and CCL5
as the main determinants of T-cell inﬁltration into cutaneous
metastases and shows that chemotherapy, by inducing expression of these chemokines within human tumors, may trigger Tcell inﬁltration and tumor control, resulting in prolonged
patient survival. Therefore, screening for chemotherapeutic
products able to induce the expression of T-cell–attracting
chemokines in cancer cells may identify drugs that improve the
efﬁcacy of immunotherapy.
