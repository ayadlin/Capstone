ABSTRACT
Background: Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is an enzyme that tumors use
to create a state of immunosuppression. Indoximod is an IDO pathway inhibitor.
Preclinical studies demonstrated that indoximod combined with chemotherapy was
synergistic in a mouse model of breast cancer. A phase I 3+3 trial was designed to
study the combination of docetaxel and indoximod.
Methods: Docetaxel was administered at 60 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks
dose levels 1-4 and 75 mg/m2 for dose level 5. Indoximod was given at 300, 600,
1000, 2000, and 1200 mg PO twice daily continuously for levels 1-5, respectively.
Serum drug levels were measured.
Results: Twenty-seven patients were treated, with 22 evaluable for response.
DLTs included grade 3 dehydration (level 1), hypotension(level 4), mucositis (level 4)
and grade 5 enterocolitis (level 2). Dose level 5 is the recommended phase II dose. The
most frequent adverse events were fatigue (58.6%), anemia (51.7%), hyperglycemia
(48.3%), infection (44.8%), and nausea (41.4%). There were 4 partial responses
(2 breast, 1 NSCLC, 1 thymic tumor). No drug-drug interactions were noted.
Conclusions: Docetaxel plus indoximod was well tolerated with no increase in
expected toxicities or pharmacokinetic interactions. It was active in a pretreated
population of patients with metastatic solid tumors.

the G1 phase of the cell cycle [3, 4]. IDO can deplete the
local tryptophan supply, thereby blocking the proliferation
of reactive T lymphocytes [3, 4].
Immune cells are often present at the tumor site,
not only to recognize and eliminate malignant cells,
but conversely to aid the tumor in evasion of immune
destruction [5]. Recent literature has determined that IDO
can be used by tumor cells to avoid elimination by the host
immune response [6]. It was hypothesized that an inhibitor
of IDO would increase the effectiveness of the T-cell

INTRODUCTION
Indoleamine 2,3-dioxgenase (IDO) is a tryptophancatabolizing enzyme that inhibits the immune response.
IDO was first discovered as an enzyme of the placenta,
essential for the prevention of fetal rejection by maternal
T cells [1]. It was later determined that IDO played a
critical role in the modulation of autoimmunity and
transplantation [2]. Because T cells are sensitive to
tryptophan deficiency, depletion causes growth arrest in

response against tumors leading to growth inhibition.
Indoximod (D-1-methyl-tryptophan) was developed as an
inhibitor of the IDO pathway. The proposed mechanism
of action is reversal of the downstream effects of IDO
activation through amino acid sensing and mTOR
pathways [7]. Preclinical data support the ability of
indoximod to reverse IDO-mediated immune suppression
[8]. The immunosuppressive activity of IDO leads to an
increase in the number of T-regulatory cells, as measured
by their Foxp3+/CD4+/CD25+ phenotype. Indoximod
has also been shown to reduce the number of T-regulatory
cells [9].
In a study with MMTV-Neu mice, researchers
looked at the activity of indoximod with and without
paclitaxel [10]. Mice with palpable tumors were treated
with control vehicle, indoximod, paclitaxel, or indoximod
with paclitaxel. A taxane was chosen based on evidence
that it increased effector T cells at the tumor site [11]. The
combination produced significantly more tumor regression
than either agent alone. This synergistic effect was lost
when the experiment was repeated in immunodeficient
mice, demonstrating that the benefit was dependent on
an anti-tumor immune response. Additional preclinical
data suggested that indoximod can synergize with other
chemotherapy agents, such as doxorubicin and platinum
salts [10]. The single-agent phase I trial of indoximod
demonstrated very good oral bioavailability and a mild
toxicity profile with no significant myelosuppression, and
no maximally tolerated dose was identified up to 2000 mg
orally twice daily [12]. Based on the preclinical data and
good safety profile of single-agent indoximod, we initiated
a phase I trial to investigate the combination therapy of
docetaxel plus indoximod in patients with metastatic solid
tumors.

lines of therapy, and could have received prior docetaxel in
the adjuvant (but not metastatic) setting. Any patient who
received prior experimental immunotherapy consisting
of targeted monoclonal antibodies was excluded.
However, patients who received prior therapy with
approved monoclonal antibodies such as bevacizumab,
cetuximab, panitumumab, or trastuzumab were eligible.
Patients were accrued through the Southeast Phase 2
Consortium consisting of the following locations: H. Lee
Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Billings
Clinic Cancer Center, Massey Cancer Center, Lineberger
Comprehensive Cancer Center, and the Winship Cancer
Institute of Emory University. Both men and women and
members of all races and ethnic groups were eligible for
this trial.

Study design
The protocol was approved by the National Cancer
Institute’s Cancer Therapeutics Evaluation Program and
conducted in accordance with all federal and institutional
guidelines. All patients provided written informed consent
under an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol
prior to initiation of any study procedure (University of
South Florida IRB, FWA# FWA00001669).
The study followed a 3+3 escalation design to
determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The
MTD is defined as the highest dose level in which less
than or equal to one out of six patients experiences
a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). DLTs were defined
as 1) non-hematological grade 3 or greater toxicity
probably attributable to therapy and not to underlying
disease, 2)  absolute neutrophil count of less than 500/
mL for longer than 7 days or neutropenic fever requiring
hospitalization despite the use of white blood cell colonystimulating factors and dose reduction of docetaxel to
60 mg/m2, 3) grade 4 thrombocytopenia (<25,000/mL),
and 4) dose delay due to hematological toxicity for more
than 14 days. Grade 3 hypophysitis and dermatitis were
the only exceptions to the DLT rule.
This phase I study evaluated the safety of docetaxel
at 60-75 mg/m2 in combination with escalating doses
of indoximod (Table 1). Dose level 5 was amended
after accrual to dose level 4 was completed due to
pharmacokinetic data from the monotherapy trial that
revealed maximal absorption was reached at 1200 mg PO
twice daily.
Indoximod was supplied by the National Cancer
Institute’s Pharmacy Branch and NewLink Genetics
Inc (50 mg and 200 mg hard gelatin capsules). It was
administered orally twice daily for 21-day continuous
cycles on an empty stomach. Docetaxel was prepared with
a single-dose diluent containing 13% ethanol in water and
was then administered intravenously over 1 hour. Standard
supportive medications, including dexamethasone and
anti-histamines as required, were used with docetaxel.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patient eligibility
Eligibility for this study included patients with
advanced solid tumors, age greater than 18 years, life
expectancy greater than 4 months, Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2, and

The primary endpoint of this trial was to determine
the MTD of the indoximod/docetaxel combination using
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 4.0.
Secondary endpoints included the determination of the
pharmacokinetic data and the overall objective response
rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) 1.1 criteria.

were used to determine levels of indoximod and
docetaxel in plasma. The methods were validated per
ICH/FDA guidelines. Plasma samples were prepared for
chromatographic injections by protein precipitation (PPT)
in both instances. However, methods were conducted as
separate analysis due to the vast differences in analyte
characteristics.
Indoximod calibration and quality control samples
were made by adding known amounts of indoximod
to blank plasma. Indoximod-d3, stable isotope labeled
internal standard, was used in the assay. A Sirocco 96well PPT plate (Waters Corp, Milford, MA) was utilized
similar to the manufacturer’s suggestion. Samples were
injected into a ThermoAccela/TSQ Quantum LC/MS/
MS system (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA). Mobile
phase consisted of water and methanol, both containing
0.1% acetic acid. Gradient pumping conditions were run,
and samples were maintained at 4°C in the autosampler
during sequences. Indoximod was separated using a Luna
C18 (2 x 50 mm, 3 μm) column (Phenomenex, Inc.,
Torrance, CA). Electrospray ionization was employed,
and multiple reaction monitoring was conducted
in positive mode utilizing the following molecular
transitions; 219  →160 and 222 →163 for indoximod
and indoximod-d3, respectively. Peaks were detected
and integration was performed with Thermo LC Quan
software.
The calibration and quality control samples for
docetaxel were made in similar fashion as previous
with blank plasma. Docetaxel–d9, stable isotope labeled
internal standard, was utilized for this analysis. Protein
precipitation was carried out in an Ostro 96-well PPT plate
(Waters Corp) according to the manufacturer’s suggestion.
The same instrument and mobile phase was used as
previously described. Samples were maintained at 8°C in
the autosampler during sequences, and gradient pumping
conditions were used. Docetaxel was separated using a
Zobrax SB C18 (2.1 x 50 mm, 3.5 μm) column (Agilent
Technologies, San Jose, CA). Electrospray ionization was
utilized, and multiple reaction monitoring was conducted
in negative mode tracking the following molecular
transitions: 806 →672 and 815 →672 for docetaxel and

Safety evaluations
Complete blood counts and metabolic panels were
obtained at baseline and every 3 weeks. Pituitary function
tests (thyroid stimulating hormone, free T4, leutinizing
hormone, follicular stimulating hormone, and adrenocortical
hormone) were obtained at baseline and every 6 weeks.
Patients underwent complete physicals and adverse event
evaluation once each cycle and as clinically indicated.

Response ealuation
Overall response rate was determined via the
criteria described by the RECIST 1.1 guidelines. Baseline
evaluations were conducted within 14 days prior to the
start of therapy. Scans were performed within 4 weeks
prior to the start of therapy. Patients were then reevaluated
every 6 weeks with diagnostic CT scans. The best overall
response achieved during study therapy was recorded
for each patient. The response data presented herein
underwent independent radiology review. The duration
of overall response was measured from the time criteria
were met for complete or partial response until the first
date that recurrent or progressive disease was documented.
In patients exhibiting response or disease stabilization,
treatment was continued until 1) disease progression,
2) intercurrent illness that prevented further treatment,
3) unacceptable adverse events despite appropriate
supportive care, or 4) patient withdrawal from trial.

for detection of peaks and integration.
Calibration curves were generated for each run,
and patient sample concentrations were back-calculated
from the corresponding regression line using LC Quan.
The assays are linear from 5 to 2500 ng/mL for both
indoximod and docetaxel. Recovery of indoximod from
plasma is on average greater than 95%. Inter- and intraassay variability was less than 9% with a relative mean
error of less than 10% for indoximod. Docetaxel average
recovery from plasma was determined to be greater than
78%. Docetaxel assay inter- and intra-assay variability
was less than 11% with a relative mean error of less
than 6%. Plasma concentration-time data for both drugs
was analyzed by non-compartmental pharmacokinetic
methods using Phoenix WinNonlin 6.3 (Pharsight Corp.,
Mountain View, CA). Data in the terminal, log-linear
phase were analyzed by linear regression to estimate
terminal elimination rate constant and half-life. These
additional pharmacokinetic parameters were also
determined: AUC0-48, AUC0-inf, Cmax, Tmax, clearance, and
volume of distribution.

day 10 and was not evaluable for response. Three patients
withdrew consent during cycle 1 and were not assessed for
the response endpoint. Twenty-two patients were included
in the response analysis. Figure 1 shows a chart of patient
flow through the trial.

Adverse events
Table 3 lists the frequency of any grade 3, 4, or
5 toxicities that occurred, as well as any grade 1 or 2
toxicity with a frequency greater than 25% regardless
of attribution. Adverse events occurring with the
highest frequency included grade 1 anemia, fatigue,
and hyperglycemia (41%, 45%, and 38%, respectively).
Common grade 3/4 adverse effects included neutropenia
and febrile neutropenia (both 13%).

Dose-limiting toxicities
DLTs included grade 3 dehydration at level 1,
grade  5 colitis at level 2, and grade 3 hypotension and
mucositis at level 4. The grade 5 colitis was caused by
sudden mesenteric ischemia leading to sepsis. The death
was determined unlikely to be related to indoximod by
the site investigators, as well as after thorough safety
review by the protocol monitoring committee. Dose level
5 (75 mg/m2 of docetaxel + 1200 mg PO twice daily of
indoximod) was administered to 6 patients without a DLT
and thus was deemed the maximally tolerated dose level.

RESULTS
Patient population
Patient demographics are outlined in Table 2.
Patients with a variety of cancers were enrolled; however,
most primary sites were categorized as non-small cell lung
carcinoma (34%) or breast (28%). Eighty-six percent of
patients received treatment in the metastatic setting before
entering the study. Of the four untreated patients, one
withdrew consent during cycle 1 and was unevaluable for
response. One of the breast cancer patients was assigned to
dose level 1 after relapsing within six months of adjuvant
dose dense doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide/paclitaxel
chemotherapy. The second breast patient relapsed on
adjuvant endocrine therapy and was assigned to dose
level 2. The fourth patient was a stage IIIB unresectable
lung cancer patient who initially was treated with
cisplatin/pemetrexed/vorinostat plus radiation, then had
progression of disease and was assigned to dose level 3.
Patients received a median of five prior therapies, mostly
consisting of chemotherapy. Almost all patients were
ECOG performance status 0 or 1.

Response rate
The overall objective response rates are summarized
in Table 4. Four patients achieved a partial response
(18%), one patient achieved stable disease for longer
than 6 months (4%), nine patients achieved stable disease
for less than 6 months (36%), and eight patients had
progressive disease (36%).
Figure 2 is a waterfall plot of each patient’s best
overall response. Four breast cancer patients achieved a
reduction in tumor burden (64.8%, 33%, 14.6%, and 6.2%
reduction of target lesions). The best of these responders
was the untreated breast cancer patient in dose level two
who had received only adjuvant endocrine therapy prior
to study entry. Two non-small cell lung cancer patients
showed a reduction in tumor size (56.5% and 8.2%), as
well as one patient with thymic cancer (78.3% reduction).
The durations of the objective responses were 15.4 and 5.9
months in the two breast cancer patients. In the lung cancer
and thymic cancer patients the duration of response was
7.1 and 5.9 months respectively. It should be noted that the
thymic cancer patient discontinued therapy secondary to
fatigue and not due to confirmed radiographic progression
of his disease. None of the objective responders were
previously treated with docetaxel. Five patients showed
only a slight increase in tumor burden with less than 10%
growth of target lesions.

Patient flow
Thirty-three patients were screened for the study
with five failing to meet all screening criteria. Twentynine patients were then registered for treatment. Two
patients withdrew consent during cycle 1, with 27 patients
initiating treatment. One patient began treatment, was
then found to be ineligible after the first cycle, and was
replaced. One patient (dose level 2) expired on cycle 1,

no interaction with docetaxel. When comparing
AUC(0-inf) on day 1 with AUC(ss) on day 8, results were
nearly the same. Figure 3 represents AUC comparisons.
The Cmax of indoximod on day 8 was higher than on day
1 at two dose levels (600 and 1000 mg), but the standard
deviation among the patients may have contributed. Doseindependent pharmacokinetic parameter estimates for
indoximod can be found in Table 5.
The pharmacokinetics results for docetaxel do not
appear to be affected by indoximod. The results of the two
dose levels evaluated were similar to results reported in
single-agent studies [13]. Dose was proportional to AUC
and Cmax for the study population. Half-life reported
here for the entire population, 20.9 (±7.8) hours (n=23),
was also similar to previous evaluations. Docetaxel
pharmacokinetics by dose level can be found in Table 6.

patients, combination strategies will need to be explored as
a way to overcome immune suppression mediated by other
pathways. Indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase represents one
such pathway, and there are efforts underway to see how
IDO inhibition can be used to boost the efficacy of other
immunotherapies [17]. Another important consideration
is that the efficacy of some chemotherapeutics and
targeted monoclonal antibodies is in part dependent on
their ability to promote an effective anti-tumor response
[18-21]. Therefore, combining immunomodulators with
chemotherapy or targeted agents to boost this immune
response is a logical next step.
This phase I trial provides important information
on the feasibility and safety of this chemoimmunotherapy
approach using a taxane and an IDO pathway inhibitor.
The multiple indications of docetaxel will allow this
combination to be tested in a variety of solid tumors
that overexpress IDO, such as breast cancer, non-small
cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, gastric cancer, and
oropharyngeal cancer [8]. Indoximod appears to be ideal
from a safety standpoint in that it does not add significantly
to the toxicity burden or myelosuppression imposed by
the chemotherapy agent. Nadir counts were not routinely
obtained due to the high baseline incidence of neutropenia
(>90%) from single-agent docetaxel, which would
make it difficult to ascertain the impact of indoximod
on asymptomatic neutropenia. This is especially the

DISCUSSION
The field of cancer immunotherapy is undergoing
a renaissance due to a greater understanding of the
complex regulatory pathways that cause tumor-related
immunosuppression. Checkpoint inhibitors such as
ipilimumab and nivolimumab demonstrated dramatic
responses and durable long-term disease control in a
fraction of patients with melanoma and non-small cell
lung cancer [14-16]. To increase the clinical benefit to

case in a smaller phase I, pretreated patient population
with diminished bone marrow reserves. Therefore, our
safety evaluations focused on clinically relevant febrile
neutropenic events or prolonged myelosuppression that
would delay subsequent therapy. The febrile neutropenia
rate of 14% was not significantly greater than what
has been described in phase III trials, but it should be
noted that these historical rates were shown in first-line
metastatic patients [22].
The challenge of fully assessing increased toxicity
from an investigational compound added to an agent
such as docetaxel within a small phase I trial is difficult.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

However, our ongoing randomized phase II combination
trial in first-line metastatic breast cancer patients
incorporates interim safety analyses with early stopping
rules for excessive toxicity. This will allow a more
adequately powered and meaningful assessment regarding
whether the combination of docetaxel and indoximod is
more toxic than docetaxel monotherapy. As far as the
activity of the combination is concerned, any definitive
comparative interpretation between the combination and
historical activity of docetaxel monotherapy is not possible
in this small, heterogeneous group of patients. The fact
that 4 of the 8 breast cancer patients showed some degree

of anti-tumor activity is an encouraging preliminary signal
and warrants further investigation.
A final point that merits discussion is the rationale
for the dose selection. While there is a slight increase in the
response rate between 75 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 docetaxel
in breast cancer patients, there is no significant difference
in time to progression between the two doses [22]. Also,
the higher toxicity of the 100 mg/m2 dose makes it difficult
to administer in metastatic patients in combination with
other investigational agents [23]. Many combination trials
have used the 75 mg/m2 docetaxel dose as their preferred
recommended phase II/III dose in patients with metastatic
breast cancer for these reasons [24, 25]. A single 1200
mg dose of indoximod almost totally saturates the gut,
and higher doses do not significantly increase peak
serum levels. This serves as our justification for moving
forward with the recommended phase II dose of 75 mg/
m2 of docetaxel in combination with twice daily 1200
mg of indoximod. A limitation of this data from a small
phase 1 trial is that one cannot exclude the possibility that
indoximod could exert better immunomodulatory effects
at slightly higher or lower dose levels of docetaxel.
In summary, we found encouraging activity in
a pre-treated population of patients with metastatic
disease. According to the pharmacokinetic data, there
were no drug-drug interactions between indoximod
and docetaxel. The combination was well tolerated
with a toxicity profile similar to docetaxel alone. The
recommended phase II dose is 75 mg/m2 of docetaxel
every 3 weeks in combination with 1200 mg indoximod
PO twice daily. The response and safety data support the
conclusion that this combination is feasible to administer
and should be investigated further in a larger randomized
phase II trial. A randomized, double blind, placebocontrolled phase II study of docetaxel plus indoximod
in metastatic breast cancer patients (NLG201) is now
accruing patients.
