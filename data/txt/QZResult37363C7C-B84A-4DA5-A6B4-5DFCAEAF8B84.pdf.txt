BACKGROUND. Pemetrexed-cisplatin chemotherapy is the standard of care in the
first-line treatment of unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Second-line cytotoxic therapy is considered for a growing group of patients, but the
optimal treatment has not been defined to date. Gemcitabine and vinorelbine
have shown activity in the first-line setting. The objective of this study was to
evaluate the activity and toxicity of the gemcitabine-vinorelbine combination in
pemetrexed-pretreated patients with MPM.

METHODS. From January 2004 to September 2006, 30 consecutive patients who
were pretreated with pemetrexed with or without a platinum-derivative were
enrolled. Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 and vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 were administered
intravenously on Days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks. Treatment was repeated for a maxi-

mum of 6 cycles or until progression or unacceptable toxicity.

RESULTS. A partial response was observed in 3 patients (10%; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 2.1–26.5%), and 10 patients (33.3%; 95% CI, 17.3–52.8%) had stable
disease after treatment. Overall, 13 patients (43.3%; 95% CI, 25.5–62.6%) achieved
disease control. The median time to progression was 2.8 months (range, 0.6–12.1
months), and the median survival was 10.9 months (range, 0.8–25.3 months).
Hematologic toxicity was acceptable, with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurring in
11% of patients and thrombocytopenia occurring in 4% of patients; no case of
febrile neutropenia was observed. Nonhematologic toxicity generally was mild.

CONCLUSIONS. The gemcitabine and vinorelbine combination was moderately
active and had an acceptable toxicity profile in pemetrexed-pretreated patients
with MPM. The role of second-line treatment in MPM needs to be evaluated in
prospective trials in large series of patients who are stratified according to previous treatment and prognostic factors. Cancer 2008;112:1555–61.  2008 American Cancer Society.

alignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive tumor
that usually has a poor prognosis. Its incidence is increasing
throughout most of the world, and it is predicted that it will rise in
the next 10 to 20 years.1 Most patients with MPM are not amenable
to radical surgery, and systemic therapy is the only potential treatment option for the majority of patients. The combination of cisplatin (Platinol; Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, NY) and pemetrexed
(Alimta; Eli-Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, Ind) has recently
become the standard of care in the first-line treatment of MPM. In
fact, this combination significantly improved the response rate (RR),
time to progression (TTP), overall survival (OS), and quality of
life compared with cisplatin alone.2 For patients who are unfit
to receive a cisplatin-based chemotherapy, pemetrexed alone3 or

combined with carboplatin (Paraplatin; Bristol-Myers
Squibb4) has been proposed as an alternative treatment choice.
The role of second-line chemotherapy in MPM is
not yet established. Two small trials dedicated to
second-line chemotherapy with the cisplatin analog
ZD0473 (cis-amminedichloro [2 methylpyridine] platinum [II]; AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, Cheshire,
United Kingdom) and with the combination of raltitrexed (Tomudex; AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals) and
oxaliplatin (Eloxatin; Sanofi-Aventis, Paris, France)
did not report efficacy but demonstrated the possibility of recruiting patients with good performance
status to second-line studies.5,6 In addition, case
study reports and Phase II studies that included
some pretreated patients have provided evidence
that additional response is possible after second-line
chemotherapy.7–9 Recently, a noteworthy activity of
pemetrexed, both alone and combined with carboplatin, as second-line treatment after prior platinumbased chemotherapy was reported.10 In a randomized, multicenter Phase III study examining pemetrexed as second-line chemotherapy versus best
supportive care (BSC), treatment with pemetrexed
provided clinical benefit with a statistically significant improvement in TTP, whereas improvement in
OS was not reported, possibly because of the influence of poststudy chemotherapy (PSC) on the BSC
arm.11 However, because pemetrexed-based regimens
are being used increasingly in the first-line setting,2,12 second-line chemotherapy should focus on
other compounds in the future.
Gemcitabine (Gemzar; Eli-Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, Ind) and vinorelbine (Navelbine; Pierre
Fabre, Castres, France) have shown some activity as
single agents13–15 or in combination16–19 in first-line
treatment of MPM. Gemcitabine showed an activity
as a single agent ranging from 0% to 31%,13,20 and it
is not known to be cross-resistant with pemetrexed.
Moreover, as a single agent or in combination, gemcitabine was the most commonly used agent in PSC
patients who were treated in the Phase III pemetrexed trial21 and is considered 1 of most interesting
drugs to explore in the second-line setting after
pemetrexed-based chemotherapy. However, the cumulative cisplatin neurotoxicity and ototoxicity limit
the enthusiasm for a cisplatin/gemcitabine combination approach in a second-line setting.16,17 Alternatively, carboplatin22–24 and oxaliplatin7,25,26 could be
combined with gemcitabine. Vinorelbine is the only
vinca alkaloid with proven single-agent activity in
MPM. Treatment of 29 assessable MPM patients with
weekly vinorelbine 30 mg/m2 produced a partial
response (PR) rate of 24% and an improvement in

general physical symptoms in 41% of patients.15 In a
dose-finding study, Delord and colleagues observed
that the coadministration of gemcitabine and vinorelbine did not enhance the toxicity profile of either
drug in patients with advanced, previously treated
malignancies. Moreover, this regimen demonstrated
activity in a pretreated patient with MPM.27 On the
basis of this background, the objective of the current
study was to assess the antitumor activity and toxicity of the combination of gemcitabine and vinorelbine in a population of pemetrexed-pretreated
patients with MPM.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
Patients were eligible for this trial if they had histologically confirmed MPM that was not amenable to
curative surgery and that was relapsing or progressing after 1 prior pemetrexed-based chemotherapy
regimen. Eligibility criteria included age >18 years,
an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
performance status (PS) 2, and an estimated life
expectancy 12 weeks. Adequate organ function was
required along with an absolute neutrophil count
1.5 3 109/L, platelets 100 3 1109/L, hemoglobin
9 g/dL, bilirubin 1.5 times the upper limit of normal, aspartate and alanine transferase levels 3
times the upper limit of normal, and creatinine <2.0
mg/dL. Patients who were receiving palliative radiation therapy for painful lesions were allowed to enter
the trial provided the patient had measurable disease
outside the irradiated site.
Previous treatment without pemetrexed-based
chemotherapy, documented brain metastases, serious
comorbidities, or other malignancies were not allowed.
Written, informed consent was obtained from each
patient before beginning treatment.
Treatment
Patients received gemcitabine at the dose of 1000
mg/m2 intravenously as a 30-minute infusion followed by vinorelbine administered as a bolus infusion at the dose of 25 mg/m2. Both drugs were given
on Days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks. Standard antiemetic
prophylaxis with intravenous metoclopramide was
used before chemotherapy. Treatment was administered on an outpatient basis. Patients who demonstrated no disease progression continued treatment
for a maximum of 6 cycles or until the withdrawal
criteria were met.
Dose adjustments at the start of a subsequent
cycle of therapy were based on hematologic and
nonhematologic toxicity observed during the preced-

ing course. Any patient who required a dose reduction continued to receive a reduced dose for the
remainder of the study. The administration of the
next cycle was delayed in the case of: 1) an absolute
neutrophil count of <1.5 3 1109/L and/or a platelet
count of <100 3 109/L; 2) any grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity (except for nausea/vomiting) that did
not resolve to grade 1 or less; or 3) an ECOG PS >2.
If these toxicities had not resolved by Day 28, then
the dose was reduced for the next cycle at 75% of
the previous dose level.
No other systemic anticancer therapies were permitted. Patients were allowed supportive care measures and symptomatic treatment for any drug-related
toxicity.

Patient Assessment
Baseline assessment included a complete medical
history, physical examination, and complete blood
count and chemistries. A chest and abdomen computed tomography (CT) scan was obtained at baseline.
Patients were staged according to the International
Mesothelioma Interest Group Tumor, Lymph Node,
Metastasis (TNM) staging system.28
Best tumor response was evaluated according to
validated hybrid unidimensional and bidimensional
criteria.2 No confirmatory scans were conducted on
patients who exhibited a PR or stable disease (SD).
Treatment toxicity was evaluated according to the
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria
version 3.0 grading system.29 Dose intensity (DI) was
assessed separately for gemcitabine and vinorelbine
in patients who received at least 2 cycles of chemotherapy as the median dose in milligrams per square
meter per week. The percentage of planned DI delivered for both drugs also was calculated and reported
as the relative DI (RDI).
After completion of the study treatment, patients
were evaluated every 2 months with chest and abdomen CT scans until disease progression. Patients also
were followed for survival until death or last contact
if they remained alive.
Study Design and Statistical Analysis
This study was planned as a single-institution Phase
II trial. Patients were enrolled prospectively. The
sample size of the trial was calculated according to
the Simon 2-stage design,30 with a type I and II error
of <10% each, to differentiate between an RR of 10%
and a response of 30%. According to this model, initial analysis was planned after 14 patients had been
treated, and there was further accrual to a total of 25
patients if at least 1 objective response was observed

1557

in the first 14 patients. The planned accrual period
was 24 months.
The primary endpoints of the study were tumor
RR and tolerability; secondary endpoints included
TTP and OS. TTP was defined as time from study
entry (first day of study treatment) until the time of
patient progression (as demonstrated on radiologic
or clinical examination) or death from any cause.
Patients without any evidence of progressive disease
were censored at the date of the last follow-up. OS
was calculated as the time from study entry until
death from any cause; patients who were alive at the
date of last follow-up were censored at that date. The
Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate actuarial
survival and follow-up.31,32 Survival rates were analyzed according to the following variables: age (<70
years vs 70 years), ECOG PS (0 vs 1 vs 2), histology
(epithelial vs nonepithelial), European Organization
for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) prognostic score (good score vs poor score),33 response to
previous pemetrexed-based chemotherapy (PR or SD
vs progressive disease), and TTP on previous pemetrexed-based chemotherapy (<6 months vs 6
months). The impact of these variables on TTP and
OS was evaluated by using the Gehan Wilcoxon
test.34 Statistical analyses were performed by using
the software package Stata 10 (STATA Corp, College
Station, Tex).

RESULTS
Patients Characteristics
Between January 2004 and September 2006, 30 consecutive patients who progressed after pemetrexedbased chemotherapy were enrolled. Their characteristics are listed in Table 1. There were 22 men and 8
women. The median age was 66 years (range, 46–85
years). Most patients had a PS 1 (83%), an epithelial histologic subtype (70%), and a poor EORTC
prognostic score (73%). Twenty-five patients (84%)
had chest involvement only, whereas the remaining
patients also had extrathoracic tumor sites. All
patients had previously received a pemetrexed-based
chemotherapy, and a PR and SD were reported in 6
patients (20%) and 15 patients (50%), respectively.
Four patients (13%) had previously received pemetrexed as single agent, and 26 patients (87%) had
received it in combination with a platinum agent,
including cisplatin in 1 patient and carboplatin in 25
patients.
Efficacy
Twenty-nine of the 30 patients were evaluated for
response, and 1 refused further treatment after 1

Treatment Delivery and Toxicity
In total, 111 cycles of chemotherapy were delivered,
and dose reductions occurred in 19 cycles (17% of all
cycles). Patients received a median of 3 cycles of
treatment (range, 1–6 cycles). Twenty-five patients
(83%) received 2 or more cycles; in these patients,
the median delivered DI was 13.73 mg/m2 per week
for vinorelbine (RDI, 82.4%) and 583.33 mg/m2 per
week for gemcitabine (RDI, 87.5%).
Treatment generally was tolerated well. Hematologic toxicity was the most frequently reported side
effect (Table 3), with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia
observed in 3 patients (10%). No episodes of febrile
neutropenia were reported. Nonhematologic toxicity
generally was mild (Table 3). One death occurred
during the treatment because of pneumonitis
(without neutropenia) in a patient with SD who previously underwent extrapleural pneumonectomy. At
the end of chemotherapy, among 13 patients achieving disease control, ECOG PS was stable in 9
patients, improved in 2 and worsened in 2.

DISCUSSION
Second-line chemotherapy is being used increasingly
in MPM, because patients who achieve a clinical
benefit from first-line chemotherapy frequently still
are healthy at the time of disease progression. However, to date, the role of second-line chemotherapy
in MPM has not been proven, and few data are available to select effective drugs. In particular, prospective
trials of second-line chemotherapy in pemetrexedpretreated patients with MPM are lacking (Table 4).
In a retrospective analysis of patients who were treated in the Phase III pemetrexed trial, approximately
42% of all patients received some form of PSC. This
group of patients had a significantly prolonged survival. However, because PSC was not randomized, it
is impossible to know whether the reduced risk of
death was associated with PSC or whether patients
who had prolonged survival were able to receive
more PSC.21 In fact, the crucial point is to distinguish
between the clinical/radiologic stability caused by
treatment effect and the natural history of disease.
To our knowledge, only 2 randomized studies have
demonstrated that chemotherapy may be better than

BSC in patients with MPM.11,35 In particular, vinorelbine plus BSC in the first-line setting produced an
improvement in terms of OS compared with BSC
alone, although the difference was not statistically
significant,35 whereas pemetrexed in the second-line
setting provided clinical benefit with a statistically
significant improvement in terms of TTP, but not in
terms of OS.11
In the current study, we tested vinorelbine combined with gemcitabine in a population of patients
who progressed after receiving pemetrexed-based
chemotherapy. Hematologic and nonhematologic
toxicities were mild. Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was
observed as the main toxicity in 3 patients (12.5%).
One death occurred during the treatment because of
pneumonitis (without neutropenia) in a patient with
SD who previously underwent extrapleural pneumonectomy.
The low rate of reduced cycles and the high
median delivered DI of both study drugs provided
evidence of good tolerability of this regimen in this
group of patients. Although quality of life was not
evaluated in our study, we observed that ECOG PS
remained roughly stable in most patients who
achieved disease control. Overall, the RR (10%), disease control rate (43.3%), TTP (2.8 months), and OS
(10.9 months) were in line with data reported in the
literature (Table 5). It is noteworthy that the proportion of patients who had SD was considerable. Emerging data suggest that the survival outcomes
faithfully reflect the drugs’ activity and should represent the best treatment endpoints in patients with
MPM in view of the marked difficulty in assessing
radiologic response.36,37 Fennell et al. demonstrated
that the radiologic response did not appear to be

correlated with survival improvement.38 A recent
overview of the EORTC Lung Cancer Group pointed
out that replacement of the RR by TTP as the primary endpoint would allow a better selection of
clinically active drugs.39 In our study, PFS was not
designed as the primary endpoint. However, considering the 3 EORTC categories (although they were
not derived from second-line studies), our regimen
demonstrated an activity between insufficient and
moderate. Accordingly, the PFS rate at 6 months was
31%, which is in the range of regimens with poor activity in the first-line setting, but it could be revalued
in view of the second-line setting of our combination
and the characteristics of our population.
The majority of our population (73%) had a poor
EORTC prognostic score, which is expected to be
associated with a shorter survival.33 Indeed, stratifying our data for EORTC score, patients who had
good scores had a significantly improved OS compared with patients who had poor scores (Table 2).
Similarly, OS was significantly longer in patients who
had a good ECOG PS. In addition, as reported in randomized trials of second-line therapy in patients
with small cell and nonsmall cell lung cancer, in our
MPM population, disease progression during firstline therapy and a shorter interval from completion
of first-line therapy were correlated with shorter TTP
and OS after second-line treatment (Table 2).
In conclusion, the results from this study suggest
the feasibility of giving second-line chemotherapy to
patients with MPM. Unfortunately, the results remain
modest, although chemotherapy could be offered to
these patients for palliation. However, MPM should
be considered an ideal field in which to test new
chemotherapy agents as well as new therapeutic strategies, including antiangiogenic compounds, small

molecules or monoclonal antibodies that target different molecular pathways, and gene therapy.40
Although it has been demonstrated that targeted
therapy with epidermal growth factor receptor and
platelet-derived growth factor receptor inhibitors and
antiangiogenic drugs is ineffective in unselected
patients, an improvement in our knowledge of the
major molecular pathways involved in MPM should
define proper targets for the systemic treatment of
this disease. Reinduction of apoptosis by manipulating its critical control points (tumor necrosis factor
10 receptor, histone deacetylases, and the proteasome), the inhibition of hepatocyte growth factor
and its receptor c-Met, the inhibition of angiogenesis, and evaluating the synergism between chemotherapy and targeted therapy all are interesting fields
in which to develop new, effective treatments. The
role of second-line treatment in MPM needs to be
evaluated in prospective trials on large series of
patients stratified according to previous treatment,
prognostic factors, and biologic features.
