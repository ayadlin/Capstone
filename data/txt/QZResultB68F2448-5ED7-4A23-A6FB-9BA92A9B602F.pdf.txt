oncogenes, and DNA damage. Increased p53 activity is associated
with cell cycle arrest, through increased expression of the cyclindependent kinase inhibitor p21Waf-1(3) and the induction of
apoptosis, via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway (4). Not
surprisingly, the inactivation of the p53-dependent pathway is a
key event in tumor initiation and progression. The loss of p53
activity is a major mechanism through which tumors become
resistant to apoptosis, escape the control of their local microenvironment, and become insensitive to many types of therapeutic
intervention. The majority of cancers harbor point mutations in
p53, most of which are in the central region of the protein
responsible for DNA binding (5).
Unlike other solid tumors, melanomas typically lack p53
mutations and retain expression of the wild-type (WT) protein,
often at high levels (6–9). This is surprising, given the highly
malignant nature of melanoma and its great resistance to
therapeutic intervention. Evidence suggests that melanoma cells
can tolerate high levels of transcriptionally active p53 (9) and have
an abnormal p53 response following DNA damage (6). It is
therefore likely that p53 is not a functional tumor suppressor in
melanoma. One of the major mechanisms of p53 inactivation in
melanoma is through the increased expression of Mdm2 (and its
human homologue Hdm2), a nuclear protein that binds to,
promotes the nuclear export of, and subsequently degrades p53
through its intrinsic E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (10). In addition to
its role in proteasomal degradation, Mdm2 also inhibits the
transcriptional activity of p53 activity through specific binding at
key residues (11). More than 50% of primary invasive and
metastatic melanoma samples overexpress Hdm2 at the protein
level, and it is likely that this contributes to functional inactivation
of p53 in melanoma (12). p53 function can also be negatively
regulated by another protein, which is structurally related to Mdm2
called Mdm4 (and its human homologue HdmX; ref. 13). Although
there is evidence that some melanoma cell lines overexpress Mdm4
(14), the exact relationship between p53 function and Mdm2/
Mdm4 expression remains to be unraveled (15).
p53 can be pharmacologically activated in cancer cell lines
through a variety of mechanisms, leading to the induction of
apoptosis (16–19). Of these, two groups have identified glycogen
synthase kinase (GSK) 3h as a major regulator of p53 localization
and expression (20, 21). Although GSK3h has received little
attention as a possible therapeutic target from the cancer research
community, several very recent studies have suggested that
inhibiting GSK3h may induce apoptosis in colorectal carcinoma
cells through a p53-dependent pathway (18, 19). Classically, GSK3h
was described as a key regulator of glycogen metabolism and is
also known to regulate other processes, such as apoptosis in

Abstract
Unlike other tumors, melanomas harbor wild-type (WT) p53
but exhibit impaired p53-dependent apoptosis. The mechanisms for the impaired p53 activation are poorly understood
but may be linked to the high expression of the p53 suppressor Mdm2, which is found in >50% of melanoma lesions.
Here, we describe an organometallic glycogen synthase kinase
3B (GSK3B) inhibitor (DW1/2) as a potent activator of p53
and inducer of cell death in otherwise highly chemoresistant
melanoma cells. Using RNA interference and pharmacologic
approaches, we show that p53 is required for the cytotoxic
effects of this organometallic inhibitor. The DW1/2 compound
was barely able to induce cell death in melanoma cells with
p53 mutations, further confirming the requirement for p53WT in the cytotoxic effects of the GSK3B inhibition. Mechanistic analysis of the p53-dependent cell death indicated an
apoptotic mechanism involving depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase cleavage, and elevated
NOXA expression. The effect of p53 was not simply due to
passive up-regulation of protein expression as adenoviralmediated overexpression of p53 was not able to induce cell
death. Treatment of melanoma cells with DW1/2 was instead
found to decrease levels of Mdm2 and Mdm4. The importance
of Mdm2 down-regulation in DW1/2-induced apoptosis was
confirmed by treating the p53-WT cells with the p53/Mdm2
antagonist Nutlin-3. Taken together, our data provide a new
strategy for the pharmacologic activation of p53 in melanoma,
which may be a viable approach for overcoming apoptotic
resistance in melanoma and offer new hope for rational
melanoma therapy. [Cancer Res 2007;67(1):209–17]

Introduction
New approaches to melanoma treatment are urgently needed (1)
and the search is on to identify new targets for intervention. One
target which has been little explored in melanoma therapy is the
so-called ‘‘guardian of the genome,’’ the p53 tumor suppressor
protein (2). Typically, p53 becomes activated in response to a range
of stimuli, such as growth factor withdrawal, the acquisition of

Cell culture. Human melanocytes and melanoma cells were isolated and
cultured as described by Smalley et al. (28). The lentiviral vector short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs for p53 were developed in the laboratory of
Dr. Maria Soengas (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) based on
published sequences (29, 30). The p53 adenovirus was from Dr. Wafik
El-Deiry (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; ref. 6). Melanoma
cells that were WT for p53 (WM793, 1205Lu, and WM115) or harbored p53
mutations (WM852, WM983A, WM983B, and WM164) have been sequenced
previously (6, 7).
Adherent cell proliferation analysis. Cells were plated into a 96-well
plate at a density of 2.5  104 per mL and left to grow overnight. Cells were
treated with increasing concentrations of DW1, DW2, or DW1/2 in
triplicate. In each instance, cells were left to grow for 72 h before being
treated with 20 AL 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) reagent for 3 h (Sigma, St Louis, MO). After this time,
medium was rapidly removed and the resulting crystals were solubilized in
DMSO. Absorbance was read in a plate reader at 540 nm. Absorbance
readings were subtracted from the value of blank wells, and the reduction in
cell growth was calculated as a percentage of control absorbance in the
absence of any drug. Data show the mean of at least three independent
experiments F SE.
Western blot analysis. Proteins were extracted and blotted as described
by Smalley et al. (28). After analysis, Western blots were stripped once and
reprobed for h-actin to show even protein loading. Antibodies to
phosphorylated GSK3h, phosphorylated p53, cleaved caspase-9, cleaved
caspase-3, Bcl-2, BAD, Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and
Bax were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The polyclonal

neurons, protein synthesis, cell proliferation, microtubule dynamics, cell motility, and Wnt signaling (22–24).
In the current study, we explore whether tumors with p53-WT,
such as melanoma, may benefit from strategies that pharmacologically activate the p53 pathway. Here, we describe for the first time
the anticancer activity of organometallic GSK3h inhibitors,
represented by DW1/2 (25, 26). Treatment of melanoma cells with
these compounds leads to the nuclear accumulation of p53, downregulation of Mdm2 and Mdm4, increased NOXA expression, and
apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway. Similar results were seen
when the melanoma cells were treated with Nutlin-3, an antagonist
that disrupts the p53/Mdm2 binding interaction leading to
enhanced p53 activation and apoptosis (27).

Materials and Methods
Synthesis of DW1 and DW2 and DW1/2. The synthesis of the
compounds DW1 and DW2 and DW1/2 were described previously by
Williams et al. (25), where DW1 corresponds to compound ‘‘1-OH.’’ The
racemic mixture DW1/2 was separated into the pure enantiomers DW1 and
DW2 with a ChiralPak AD-H analytic high-pressure liquid chromatography
column (Daicel/Chiral Technologies, West Chester, PA) using a gradient of
hexanes and ethanol (7:3 to 1:4 in 20 min) with a flow rate of 0.95 mL/min.
The compound structures are given in Fig. 1A.
In vitro kinase assays. In vitro kinase assays were done as described
previously by Williams et al. (25).

antibody to Mdm4 (HdmX) was from Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery,
TX). The monoclonal antibody to h-actin was from Sigma and the
monoclonal antibody for p53 (DO-1) was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA).
Monoclonal antibodies to GSK3h, h-catenin, Mdm2, p21, p27, and NOXA
were from BD Biosciences (Franklin Lakes, NJ).
Three-dimensional spheroid growth. Melanoma spheroids were
prepared using the liquid overlay method and treated as described
previously (31).
Cell cycle analysis. Cells were plated into 10-cm dishes at 60%
confluency and left to grow overnight before being treated either with
DW1/2 (100 nmol/L–1 Amol/L) for 24 h or with Nutlin-3 (5–20 Amol/L;
Cayman Chemical Co. Ann Arbor, MI), LiCL (30 mmol/L), or SB216763
(20 Amol/L) for 24 to 72 h. Cells were then treated and analyzed as
described previously (31).
Flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential (#y m). After the treatment of the cells with DW1/2
(300 nmol/L or 1 Amol/L, 24 h), cells were washed once with Annexin
binding buffer [10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 140 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L
CaCl2], resuspended in 100 AL binding buffer containing 1 AL FITCconjugated Annexin V (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and 25 nmol/L
tetramethylrhodamine, methyl ester, perchlorate (TMRM; Molecular Probes,
Eugene, OR), and incubated at 37jC for 15 min. Cells were then analyzed for
Annexin V fluorescence (green) and TMRM retention (red fluorescence)
using flow cytometry.
Immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells were seeded thinly onto
ethanol-sterilized glass coverslips in six-well plates and left to grow
overnight. After which they were treated with either DW1/2 (1 Amol/L), LiCl
(30 mmol/L), SB216763 (20 Amol/L), or Nutlin-3 (15 Amol/L) for 24 h before
being fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v)
Triton X-100. Samples were then blocked in PBS containing 1% bovine
serum albumin. Primary antibody incubations to p53, pH2AX, pATM (all at
1:100; Calbiochem), or cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; Cell
Signaling Technology) were done at 37jC for 1 h under humidified
conditions. Slides were prepared as described by Smalley et al. (28).
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end
labeling staining. Cells were thinly seeded onto coverslips in six-well
plates and left to adhere overnight. Cells were treated with DW1/2
(100 nmol/L–3 Amol/L) for 72 h before being fixed and permeabilized in
4% formaldehyde and 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100. Cells were then treated using
fluorescein/terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick
end labeling (TUNEL) reagents from an in situ cell death detection kit
(Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) for 1 h before being washed and
treated with antifade. Cells were analyzed as for immunofluorescence.

lines (WM793, WM115, WM164, WM852, and 1205Lu; Fig. 1C).
Often the pharmacologic profile of drugs in two-dimensional cell
culture is not predictive of the response in three-dimensional
melanoma spheroid culture (31). To investigate this further,
spheroids formed from 1205Lu cells were implanted into a threedimensional collagen I gel and treated with DW1/2 (1–10 Amol/L)
for 72 h. It was found that 1 Amol/L DW1/2 markedly reduced cell
viability of the spheroid, as shown by the loss of green staining and
increased red staining and lack of invasion into the surrounding
collagen (Fig. 1D).
Treatment with DW1/2 induces apoptosis through the
intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. Cell cycle analysis showed
that treatment of melanoma cells (WM793 and 1205Lu) with
DW1/2 for 24 h led to a concentration-dependent increase in the
number of cells in the sub-G1 population, suggesting that DW1/2
was inducing apoptosis (Fig. 2A). At the highest concentration
(1 Amol/L), levels of apoptosis were 47% and 65% in the 1205Lu
and WM793 cells, respectively. In other studies, cells were treated
with drug for 24 h, fixed, stained, and labeled using a TUNEL kit.
Again, like the cell cycle analysis, increasing concentrations of
DW1/2 increased the level of TUNEL staining (data not shown).
To investigate the mechanism of apoptosis, cells were treated with
1 Amol/L DW1/2 for 0, 2, 6, and 24 h, and protein was extracted
and probed for expression of the cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-9
(Fig. 2B). Caspase-9 was cleaved rapidly (<6 h) and caspase-3 was
cleaved after 6 h of drug treatment. Following DW1/2 treatment,
there was little change in levels of Bcl-2, Bax, or BAD (Fig. 2B).
However, there was a marked reduction in levels of phosphorylated
BAD after 2 h of DW1/2 treatment. A prolonged treatment of
the cells with DW1/2 (24 h) led to increased expression of NOXA
(Fig. 2B). Further evidence for DW1/2-induced apoptosis through
the intrinsic pathway was shown by an increase in Annexin V
positivity and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Dw m) as
measured by loss of TMRM staining (Fig. 2C). These processes
started as early as 3 h, with rapid progression during subsequent
time points (6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h; Fig. 2C). To confirm whether the
DW1/2 had any selectivity for tumor cells over normal cells,
primary human skin melanocytes derived from foreskins were
treated with increasing concentrations of DW1/2 (30 nmol/L–
1 Amol/L) for 24 h followed by Annexin V staining and flow
cytometry (Fig. 2D). It was noted that only very little apoptosis was
seen in the melanocytes (6%) following 1 Amol/L DW1/2 treatment
(24 h) compared with 31% in the 1205Lu melanoma cells at the
same drug concentration. In other studies, we looked at the ability
of DW1/2 to reduce the growth of primary human skin fibroblasts
in MTT assays and found a markedly weaker antiproliferative effect
relative to that seen for WM793 melanoma cells (Supplementary
Fig. S1A). To determine the cross-reactivity of DW1/2 on other
major melanoma survival pathways, we also looked at levels of
phosphorylated Akt and phosphorylated ERK. It was noted that
there was a substantial decrease in phosphorylated Akt activity
after 2 h of DW1/2 treatment but little effect on phosphorylated
ERK levels (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
GSK3B as a potential pharmacologic target of DW1/2induced apoptosis. It has been suggested that GSK3h activity may
be involved in the regulation of p53 expression. DW1/2 is a highly
potent inhibitor of GSK3h in in vitro kinase assays (25). Protein
expression studies revealed that GSK3h was highly expressed in all
melanoma cell lines tested (Fig. 3A). Probing of the same protein
extracts revealed that GSK3h was constitutively phosphorylated at
Ser9 (Fig. 3A). In spite of this, DW1/2 was still able to inhibit GSK3h

Results
The novel organometallic kinase inhibitors block the
growth of melanoma cells in both two-dimensional and
three-dimensional culture models. In vitro kinase assays
revealed the IC50 values for DW1 to be 2 and 2.5 nmol/L for
GSK3a and GSK3h, respectively, and the IC50 values for DW2 to be
9 and 15 nmol/L for GSK3a and GSK3h, respectively, at an ATP
concentration of 100 Amol/L. Treatment of 1205Lu melanoma cells
with increasing concentrations (3 nmol/L–3 Amol/L) of DW1,
DW2, and DW1/2 for 72 h (structures shown in Fig. 1A) led to
concentration-dependent reduction in cell growth (Fig. 1B). In
agreement with the in vitro kinase data, it was noted that DW2 was
less potent than DW1. However, as the racemic mixture DW1/2
displayed similar potency to DW1 and did not require resolving, all
subsequent experiments were done on this compound. DW1/2 had
growth-inhibitory activity against a panel of five melanoma cell

Figure 2. DW1/2 induces apoptosis in human melanoma
cells via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. A, DW1/2
induces concentration-dependent apoptosis in human
melanoma cells. 1205Lu and WM793 cells were treated
with increasing (100 nmol–1 Amol/L) concentrations
of DW1/2 for 24 h. Cells were then harvested and
ethanol-fixed before being stained with propidium iodide
and analyzed using flow cytometry. B, DW1/2 induces
cleavage of caspase-3 (Casp-3 ) and caspase-9 (Casp-9)
and reduces levels of phosphorylated BAD (p-BAD ) and
increases NOXA expression in melanoma cells. 1205Lu
cells were treated with DW1/2 (1 Amol/L) for 6, 16, and
24 h, after which proteins were extracted. Resulting
proteins were resolved by Western blotting and probed for
expression of cleaved caspase-3, caspase-9, Bcl-2, Bax,
BAD, phosphorylated BAD, and NOXA. Equal protein
loading was confirmed by stripping the blots and reprobing
for actin expression. C, phosphatidylserine externalization
in 1205Lu cells was determined using Annexin V staining
and reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential (Dw m)

activity in 1205Lu cells and increase levels of h-catenin expression
(Fig. 3B). Similar results were also seen when the cells were treated
for 24 h with the unrelated GSK3h inhibitor LiCl (30 mmol/L;
Fig. 3B). In other studies, we treated melanoma cells with two other
GSK3h inhibitors, LiCl and SB216763, and found that both were
able to increase nuclear p53 accumulation (Fig. 3C) and induce
substantial levels of apoptosis (Fig. 3D).
DW1/2 up-regulates nuclear p53 expression and induces
apoptosis in melanoma cells with p53-WT. Nonselective GSK3h
inhibitors, such as LiCl, up-regulate p53 expression (Fig. 3C). To
investigate the possible role of p53 in the proapoptotic activity of
DW1/2, melanoma cells that were p53-WT (1205Lu) and p53-mut
(WM852) were treated with DW1/2 (1 Amol/L) for 24 h and stained
for p53 expression. It was found that DW1/2 up-regulated nuclear
levels of p53 in the 1205Lu cells (Fig. 4A and B) but not the WM852
cells (data not shown). Interestingly, nuclear staining for p53 was
seen in the WM852 in the absence of drug treatment, but this did
not alter following administration of DW1/2.
Treatment of WM852 cells with DW1/2 (1 Amol/L) for 24 h did
not increase the proportion of cells in the sub-G1 apoptotic
phase of the cell cycle and was instead associated with increased
G2-M phase arrest (Fig. 4C). Similar results (<10% apoptosis)
were also seen with other p53-mut cell lines (WM983A and

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (1). January 1, 2007

WM983B; Supplementary Fig. S1C). Further evidence for the p53dependent effects of DW1/2 came from apoptosis studies where
either 1205Lu or WM852 cells were drug treated for 24 h followed
by staining for either TUNEL or cleaved PARP (Fig. 4D). In each
case, DW1/2 treatment increased levels of both TUNEL and
cleaved PARP staining in the 1205Lu cells but not the WM852
cells.
p53-dependent apoptosis can also arise indirectly, as a consequence of DNA damage and through the generation of reactive
oxygen species (ROS). As some metal ions, such as platinum, can
induce p53 expression following DNA damage, we investigated
whether the ruthenium-based DW1/2 compound also induced a
DNA damage response. Treatment of 1205Lu cells for
0, 2, 6, or 24 h (1 Amol/L) did not lead to an increase in the
nuclear staining of phosphorylated H2AX or phosphorylated
ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), which are both markers of
DNA damage (Supplementary Fig. S2A). In contrast, treatment
of the same cells with cisplatin led to increased phosphorylation of
both H2AX and ATM after 24 h of treatment. As further evidence
of DW1/2 working through a non-DNA damage–mediated p53
induction mechanism, we showed the rapid up-regulation of the
p53 target gene p21 after 6 h of DW12 treatment (Supplementary
Fig. S2B). Finally, we investigated whether DW1/2 induced

reduction of Mdm2 and Mdm4 expression (>2 h; Fig. 5D). In
contrast, cisplatin (40 Amol/L) induced a much slower upregulation of p53 expression, which was seen only after 24 h of
treatment (data not shown).
Pharmacologic activation of p53, but not p53 overexpression, induces apoptosis in p53-WT melanoma cells. Nutlin-3
activates p53 through the disruption of the p53/Mdm2 interaction
(27). Here, we show that 24-h treatment of the p53-WT 1205Lu
melanoma cells with Nutlin-3 leads to nuclear accumulation of p53
(Fig. 6A). In contrast, treatment of p53-mut melanoma cells with
Nutlin-3 had little effect on either p53 expression or nuclear localization (data not shown). Treatment of the p53-WT 1205Lu cell line
with Nutlin-3 (10 Amol/L) was associated with up-regulation of the
p53 transcriptional target p21 as well as p27 (Fig. 6B). In contrast,
no up-regulation of either p21 or p27 was seen following Nutlin-3
treatment in the p53-mut cell line WM852 (Fig. 6B). Cell cycle
analysis of p53-WT 1205Lu cells showed that Nutlin-3 induced a
progressive accumulation of cells in the sub-G1 phase, indicating
that this compound was inducing apoptosis (Fig. 6C). Similar
experiments in the p53-mut cell line WM852 revealed little apoptosis following Nutlin-3 treatment (Fig. 6C). It was important to
ascertain whether p53-dependent apoptosis in melanoma cells was
the result of inhibiting the p53/Mdm2 complex or only increased
p53 expression. To investigate this point, we infected p53-WT
and p53-mut cells with an adenovirus for p53. It was noted that
overexpression of p53 induced apoptosis in the p53-mut WM852
cells but not the p53-WT 1205Lu cells (Fig. 6D). Western blot
analysis confirmed that the adenoviral infection led to increased
p53 expression in both melanoma cell lines (data for 1205Lu is
shown in Fig. 6D).

apoptosis through a ROS-dependent mechanism by pretreating
the cells with the antioxidants TROLOX (200 Amol/L; Supplementary Fig. S3) or N-acetylcysteine (5 Amol/L) and found that there
was no protection from DW1/2-induced apoptosis.
Knockdown of p53 reduces DW1/2-induced apoptosis in
p53-WT melanoma cells. As melanoma cells have abnormalities
in many apoptotic pathways, it is often difficult to compare
between cell lines. To overcome this, we investigated the role of p53
in DW1/2-induced apoptosis within a defined, isogenic system
where p53 was knocked down in WM793 cells using a stable shRNA
lentiviral vector system (29, 30). After green fluorescent protein
(GFP)–based selection studies, two p53 shRNA clones (p53.1 and
p53.2) gave significant protein knockdown (>90%; Fig. 5A). Control
vectors with mutated shRNA sequences were identical to
uninfected controls (data not shown). The functional knockdown
of p53 protein in the WM793 cells was shown following treatment
of the cells with Nutlin-3 (15 Amol/L, 48 h; Fig. 5A). In the WM793p53 cells, there was little apoptosis following Nutlin-3 treatment
and the cells continued to proliferate (sub-G1, 4%), whereas the
control cells underwent apoptosis (sub-G1, 27%).
Treatment of the WM793-p53 RNA interference cells with
increasing concentrations of DW1/2 was associated with significantly less apoptosis (P < 0.05) than seen in the WT cells (Fig. 5B
and C), with 54.2 F 3.3% and 26.1 F 2.7% apoptosis being induced
following DW1/2 treatment (1 Amol/L) in the WM793 and WM793p53 cells, respectively.
To investigate the effects of DW1/2 on p53 regulation, cells were
treated with drug for increasing periods before being probed for
expression of p53, Mdm2, and Mdm4. It was noted that there was a
rapid increase in p53 expression (<2 h) with a slower but marked

least partly inactivated in melanoma cells, which is most likely a
consequence of constitutive high Akt activity (33, 34). Although
GSK3h was Ser9 phosphorylated in the melanoma cells, DW1/2
treatment was still able to up-regulate h-catenin expression in the
1205Lu melanoma cells, showing that the melanoma cells still
possessed some GSK3h activity that could be blocked by these
compounds. The lower selectivity of DW2 over DW1 in the MTT
assays shows that growth inhibition was directly correlated with
the ability of these compounds to inhibit GSK3 in the in vitro
kinase assay. Similar h-catenin-stabilizing and growth-inhibitory
results were also seen following treatment with two other GSK3h
inhibitors, SB216763 and LiCl.
Several studies have suggested that intracellular signaling is
modified by the tumor microenvironment (31, 35, 36). Our previous
studies have shown that melanoma cells derived from metastases
become completely resistant to the growth-arresting activity of
inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and mitogenactivated protein/ERK pathways when grown as three-dimensional
collagen-implanted spheroid (31). Here, we show that the 1205Lu
cells still respond well to the DW1/2 when grown under these

Unlike many other tumors, melanomas express p53-WT (6, 7)
but exhibit impaired p53-dependent apoptosis. In the current
study, we investigated two classes of drugs that activate p53
through different mechanisms. First, we characterized an organometallic kinase inhibitor with high affinity for GSK3h and show
that it induces p53-dependent apoptosis in human melanoma
cells. Second, we showed that Nutlin-3, a p53/Mdm2 antagonist,
induces a similar p53-dependent apoptosis. It is therefore suggested that the pharmacologic manipulation of p53 in melanoma
could represent a novel approach to therapy.
Here, we report for the first time the remarkable anticancer
activity of DW1/2 on human melanoma cells. In most of the
melanoma cell lines tested, 300 nmol/L of the DW1/2 were able to
maximally inhibit cell growth. DW1/2 represents a member of a
series of organometallic kinase inhibitors derived from the class of
indolocarbazole alkaloids (e.g., staurosporine) with very high
selectivity for GSK3h (25, 26, 32).
All of the melanoma cells tested had high levels of the Ser9
phosphorylated form of GSK3h, suggesting that this kinase was at

apoptosis in a defined isogenic system where melanoma cells with
p53-WT (WM793) had the p53 stably knocked down using a
lentiviral shRNA (WM793-p53). Knockdown of p53 in WM793 cell
line was found to significantly reduce the levels DW1/2-induced
apoptosis by 48%, suggesting that p53 played an important role in
DW1/2-mediated apoptosis. The fact that total suppression of
apoptosis was not achieved can be either explained by the fact that
the levels of p53 knockdown were not sufficient to completely
abolish all DW1/2-mediated apoptosis or that there are other
p53-independent apoptosis mechanisms involved in the activity of
DW1/2. The fact that the WM793-p53 cells also display a blunted
response to the p53/Mdm2 antagonist Nutlin-3 shows that levels of
p53 knockdown achieved are sufficient to block p53-induced
apoptosis, suggesting that DW1/2 may have additional mechanisms
of apoptosis induction. The p53 dependency of GSK3h inhibitor/
chemotherapy–mediated apoptosis has been shown previously in
two separate studies using the HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cell
lines, which either express or were null for p53 (18, 19). In these
studies, it was shown that a panel of GSK3h inhibitors (SB 216763,
purvalanol A, and LiCl) only induced p21 expression (indicative of
p53 activity) and sensitized the cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in the p53-expressing cells and not in the p53-null cells (18, 19).

conditions, suggesting that there is no acquisition of drug
resistance to DW1/2 under three-dimensional culture conditions.
Treatment of melanoma cells that were WT for p53 (p53-WT)
with DW1/2 led to the rapid induction apoptosis via the intrinsic
caspase-9/caspase-3 mitochondrial pathway. Treatment of the
melanoma cells with other GSK3h inhibitors, such as LiCl and
SB216763, were also found to induce apoptosis. The p53 pathway
is a major activator of mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis. Consistent with this, treatment of p53-WT cells with DW1/2 led to the
up-regulation of nuclear p53 expression. Interestingly, in p53-mut
cells, the levels of p53 were high in the absence of the DW1/2 and
were not altered following treatment, suggesting that mutations in
p53 rendered the cells unresponsive to DW1/2. This was further
shown by the fact that melanoma cells with mutated p53 (WM852,
WM983A, and WM983B) did not undergo any (WM852) or very
little (<10%; WM983A and WM983B) apoptosis following administration of DW1/2. The possible role of GSK3h in the observed upregulation of p53 expression in melanoma cells was also confirmed
when cells were treated with LiCl and SB216763.
Tumor cells are genetically heterogeneous and harbor many
mutations that work together to suppress apoptosis. To account for
this, we further explored the role of p53 in DW1/2-induced

been shown that melanoma cells with p53-WT can tolerate high levels
of exogenous p53 (9). It therefore seems likely that DW1/2 may
function in a similar manner to Nutlin-3 in freeing the p53 from its
suppressors rather than only increasing p53 expression. To investigate this further, we treated the 1205Lu cells with DW1/2 and looked
for up-regulation of p53 and down-regulation of Mdm2 and Mdm4.
Treatment with DW1/2 induced a rapid increase in p53 expression,
a rapid down-regulation of Mdm4 expression (<2 h), and a slower
down-regulation of Mdm2 (6 h). Recent studies have shown that
both Mdm4 and Mdm2 play important roles in regulating p53 function, with Mdm4 regulating p53 activity and Mdm2 being more responsible for p53 stability (15). To our knowledge, this is the first report
showing the pharmacologic down-regulation of Mdm4 expression.
Several recent studies have begun to shed light on the GSK3hmediated regulation of p53 expression. It has been suggested that
GSK3h cooperates with Mdm2 to directly regulate the export of p53
from the nucleus via phosphorylation of p53 at Ser315 and Ser376
(20). Our own studies revealed a transient increase in Ser6 but not
Ser315 phosphorylation of p53 following DW1/2 treatment (data not
shown). Others have shown that overexpression of GSK3h directly
reduces levels of p53 expression through the direct phosphorylation
of Mdm2 (21).

To further investigate whether p53 activation was a bona fide
approach for the induction of apoptosis in melanoma, we next
tried Nutlin-3, another drug known to increase p53 activity,
through disruption of the p53/Mdm2 interaction (16, 27). Like
DW1/2, Nutlin-3 also increased nuclear accumulation of p53 in
p53-WT melanoma cells. Like DW1/2, Nutlin-3 also increases the
transcriptional activity of p53, as shown by the increased
expression of p21Waf-1 in p53-WT cells but not in p53-mut cells.
In a similar manner, Nutlin-3 also induced apoptosis in p53-WT
melanoma cells but not p53-mut cells. In this instance, onset of
apoptosis was slower (>48 h) than that seen to DW1/2, which
induced significant apoptosis after 24 h of treatment.
To gain further insight into the mechanisms behind the
proapoptotic activity of DW1/2 and Nutlin-3, we overexpressed
p53 in both p53-WT and p53-mut melanoma cells using an adenoviral vector. It was found that p53 overexpression only induced
apoptosis in the p53-mut cells and not in the p53-WT cells. This
suggested that mere overexpression of p53 was not sufficient to
induce apoptosis and that the p53-WT cells possessed other mechanisms to suppress p53-induced apoptosis. Indeed, others have
shown the poor transcriptional activation of p53 target genes in
p53-WT melanoma cells following DNA damage (37). It has also

GSK3b Inhibitors in Melanoma Therapy

Acknowledgments

Here, we have shown for the first time that activation of p53,
using either the novel organometallic kinase inhibitor DW1/2 or
the Mdm2/p53 antagonist Nutlin-3, led to the efficient induction of
apoptosis in human melanoma cells. At present, GSK3h inhibitors
are being explored in both preclinical and clinical settings for a
wide range of disease states from diabetes to neurodegeneration
(38). The fact that melanomas harbor p53-WT, which can be
activated pharmacologically, makes GSK3h inhibitors and Nutlin-3
attractive novel therapeutic approaches.
