Abstract
Glioma stem cells (GSC) possess tumor-initiating potential and are relatively resistant to conventional
chemotherapy and irradiation. Thus, they are considered to be major drivers for glioma initiation, progression,
and recurrence. However, the precise mechanism governing acquisition of their drug resistance remains to be
elucidated. Our previous study has shown that inhibitor of differentiation 4 (ID4) dedifferentiates Ink4a/Arf/
mouse astrocytes and human glioma cells to glioma stem-like cells (induced GSCs or iGSCs). In this article, we
report that ID4-driven iGSCs exhibit chemoresistant behavior to anticancer drugs through activation of ATPbinding cassette (ABC) transporters. We found that ID4 enhanced SOX2 protein expression by suppressing
microRNA-9* (miR-9*), which can repress SOX2 by targeting its 30 -untranslated region. Consequently, ID4mediated SOX2 induction enhanced ABCC3 and ABCC6 expression through direct transcriptional regulation,
indicating that ID4 regulates the chemoresistance of iGSCs by promoting SOX2-mediated induction of ABC
transporters. Furthermore, we found that short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of SOX2 in ID4-driven iGSCs
resulted in loss of cancer stemness. Moreover, ectopic expression of SOX2 could dedifferentiate Ink4a/Arf/
astrocytes and glioma cells to iGSCs, indicating a crucial role of SOX2 in genesis and maintenance of GSCs.
Finally, we found that the significance of the ID4-miR-9*-SOX2-ABCC3/ABCC6 regulatory pathway is recapitulated in GSCs derived from patients with glioma. Together, our results reveal a novel regulatory mechanism by
which ID4-driven suppression of miR-9* induces SOX2, which imparts stemness potential and chemoresistance
to glioma cells and GSCs. Cancer Res; 71(9); 3410–21. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common and
aggressive form of brain malignancies, remains mostly incurable and has about 1-year median survival postdiagnosis,
despite considerable advances in diagnosis, therapies, and
understanding of its molecular pathways (1–5). Recent studies
have revealed that a cancer-cell subpopulation in brain
tumors—glioma stem cells (GSC)—exhibits tumor-initiating
ability, self-renewal, and aberrant differentiation and is
responsible for glioma initiation and progression (6, 7). Interestingly, GSCs are remarkably resistant to chemotherapy and
irradiation, which are first-line treatment options for patients
with malignant gliomas (8, 9). Therefore, GSCs are considered
major culprits for glioma recurrence after therapy (10).

Although resistance to temozolomide is associated with
the expression of O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase,
which is abundantly detected in CD133-positive GBMs (11), a
major cause of chemoresistance in GSCs is the activation of
multiple drug resistance genes, such as those encoding ATPbinding cassette (ABC) transporters (8). ABC transporters can
cause efflux of molecules across the cell membrane by using
ATP and are highly expressed in normal and cancer stem cells
compared with their differentiated counterpart cells (12, 13). A
recent study has shown that PI3K/Akt signaling, which is
activated by PTEN loss, confers chemoresistance to GSCs by
enhancing ABCG2 activity (14). However, the mechanism
underlying the expression of various ABC transporters
involved in the chemoresistance of GSCs remains poorly
understood.
MicroRNAs (miRNA or miR) are an evolutionarily conserved group of small noncoding RNAs that play pivotal roles
in regulating most biological processes of normal development and various diseases, including cancers, by suppressing
mRNA stability and/or translation (15). Recently, the biological consequences of miRNAs have been revealed in many
studies showing that miRNAs specifically regulate maintenance and differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESC) and
induce pluripotent stem cells (iPSC; ref. 16). For example, miR145, which is highly upregulated during differentiation, can

repress pluripotency in human ESCs by suppressing many
reprogramming factors, including OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4 (17).
Conversely, miR-291-3p, miR-294, and miR-295, which are
specifically expressed in ESCs, can increase the efficiency of
iPSC genesis by inducing OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4 (18). These
reprogramming factors are upregulated in various human
malignancies, and some are encoded by classical oncogenes
(19–21). In addition, SOX2 is highly expressed in patients with
glioma and plays a crucial role in GSC maintenance (22).
However, the precise roles, such as tumor initiation, selfrenewal, aberrant differentiation, and chemo/radioresistance,
of these reprogramming factors in GSC nature remain to be
elucidated.
Previously, we have shown that inhibitor of differentiation 4
(ID4) induces dedifferentiation of Ink4a/Arf/ mouse astrocytes, generating GSC-like cells (iGSCs) through activation of
cyclin E and Notch signaling (23). However, the molecular
mechanism governing the chemoresistance of ID4-driven
iGSCs has not been elucidated. In this article, our data show
that ID4 confers chemoresistance to GSCs by inducing
the expression of 2 SOX2-mediated ABC transporters—ABCC3
and ABCC6—through direct suppression of miRNA-9*
(miR-9*), a SOX2-targeting miRNA.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and conditions
Human glioma cell lines (A172, A1207, LN18, and LN229)
were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection
and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/high
glucose supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone), 1% penicillin
and streptomycin (Life Technologies), and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine (Life Technologies). Human glioma stem cells (hGSC-1,
hGSC-2, and hGSC-3; ref. 24) and glioma cells were grown in
suspension culture with neurobasal medium (NBE; Invitrogen) supplemented with modified N2, B27, epidermal growth
factor (EGF; 20 ng/mL; R&D Systems), and basic fibroblast
growth factor (bFGF; 20 ng/mL; R&D Systems). For neurosphere-formation assays, cells were seeded at a density of 2
cells/mm2 in 12-well plates and then grown in suspension with
NBE supplemented with N2, B27, EGF, and bFGF (all 20 ng/
mL), as described previously (23). EGF and bFGF were
replaced every 3 days, and the neurosphere numbers were
determined after 14 days.
Luciferase reporter gene assay, RNA analysis, plasmid and
gene transduction, Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence
assay, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay, fluorescence activated cell-sorting (FACS) assay, in vivo tumorigenicity assay, apoptosis analysis, side population cell analysis,
and statistical analysis were done. Details of experimental
procedures are provided in the Supplementary Information.

Results
ID4 primes anticancer drug resistance through
induction of ABC transporters
To investigate whether ID4 confers chemoresistance to
cells, we established ID4-overexpressing glioma cells (A172-

www.aacrjournals.org

ID4 and A1207-ID4) by transduction of retroviral vectorencoding ID4 genes, as well as ID4-depleted cells (LN229shID4) using short hairpin RNA interference (shRNAi). Compared with their controls, cell death evaluated on flow cytometric analysis revealed that A172-ID4 and A1207-ID4 were
significantly resistant whereas LN229-shID4 was sensitive to
1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU)-induced apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S1). Our previous study has shown
that ID4 allows Ink4a/Arf/ astrocytes and glioma cells to
acquire GSC properties through activation of cyclin E and
Jagged1-Notch1 signaling (23). Thus, we examined whether
these pathways were required for ID4-mediated antiapoptosis
by treating cells with BCNU, in combination with purvalanol A
(a cyclin E inhibitor; ref. 25) and/or DAPT (a Notch inhibitor),
and found that cyclin E and Notch signaling were not involved
in ID4-mediated chemoresistance of A172, A1207, and LN229
(Supplementary Fig. S1). A recent study had shown that GSCs
acquire anticancer drug resistance through PI3K/Aktmediated ABCG2 activation (14) and, therefore, we investigated whether ID4-driven chemoresistance was associated
with ABC transporter activity. First, we cotreated cells with
BCNU and the pan-ABC transporter inhibitor verapamil (14)
and found that verapamil suppressed BCNU-induced apoptosis in A172-ID4 (Fig. 1A) but not in LN229-shID4 (Fig. 1A),
indicating that ID4 causes cells to retain chemoresistance, at
least in part, through ABC transporter activity.
Next, we carried out semiquantitative real-time PCR (RTPCR) analysis to examine which ABC transporters are differentially regulated by ID4 and found that the levels of ABCC3,
ABCC6, and ABCA2 were significantly elevated in A172-ID4
(Supplementary Fig. S2A) and the levels of ABCC3, ABCC4,
ABCC6, and ABCG2 were increased in Ink4a/Arf/ astrocyteID4 (Supplementary Fig. S2B). On the contrary, the levels of
ABCC2, ABCC3, ABCC6, and ABCG2 were markedly reduced in
LN229-shID4 (Supplementary Fig. S2C). In addition, we examined the expression of ABC transporters in 2 human GSCs
(hGSC) derived from GBM patients (24) and found that the
levels of ABCC3 and ABCC6 were diminished in ID4-depleted
hGSC1 (Supplementary Fig. S2D) and the levels of ABCC3,
ABCC6, and ABCG2 were decreased in ID4-depleted hGSC2
(Supplementary Fig. S2E). Thus, to further investigate a possible role of ABC transporters in ID4-driven chemoresistance,
we focused on ABCC3 and ABCC6. We depleted ABCC3 and
ABCC6 in ID4-overexpressing cells by using shRNAi and
confirmed their depletion in A172-ID4 and A1207-ID4 by
quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot assays
(Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig. S3A and B). The depletion of
ABCC3 and ABCC6 in ID4-overexpressing cells resulted in a
marked increase in apoptosis (Fig. 1C), suggesting that ID4mediated chemoresistance to BCNU is partially attributed to
increased ABCC3 and ABCC6 expression.
ID4 upregulates SOX2 by suppressing miR-9*
expression
The preceding data raise the question pertaining to how ID4
upregulates ABCC3 and ABCC6 mRNA expression, because
ID4 is a helix–loop–helix (HLH) protein that lacks a DNAbinding domain, and it can suppress transcription by acting as

a dominant-negative transcriptional repressor (26). During the
investigation of regulatory mechanisms pertaining to ID4driven ABCC3 and ABCC6 expression, we found that the ID4
level correlated with SOX2 protein expression—that is,
increased SOX2 protein levels were observed in A1207-ID4
and A172-ID4, whereas decreased SOX2 protein levels were
observed in LN229-shID4 (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. S4;
ref. 23). In addition, SOX2 protein levels correlated with ABCC3
and ABCC6 protein levels in these cells. Interestingly, qRT-PCR
analysis revealed that ID4-induced SOX2 protein levels were
not correlated with its mRNA levels (Fig. 2A), indicating that
ID4 might regulate SOX2 expression at the posttranscriptional
level. Emerging evidence suggests that various biological processes are regulated by miRNAs that act as negative regulators
of gene expression at the posttranscriptional level (15). Therefore, we attempted to explore miRNAs based on 3 criteria: (i)
miRNAs that can target the 30 -untranslated region (UTR) of
SOX2 (examined using bioinformatics programs such as PicTar, TargetScan, miRBase, and Miranda); (ii) miRNAs that are
enriched in brain tissues and are involved in differentiation
of neural stem cells (NSC) or progenitors; and (iii) miRNAs
that possess E-boxes—ID4-responsive elements—in their

3412

promoters. Consequently, we found that one such candidate
is miR-9*, known to be specifically expressed during brain
neurogenesis (27, 28). To validate our bioinformatics criteria,
we initially carried out a TaqMan microRNA detection assay
and found that miR-9* expression was significantly decreased
in A1207-ID4 and A172-ID4 but enhanced in LN229-shID4
(Fig. 2B). The luciferase activity of the reporter construct
containing 3 copies of the miR-9*–binding motif (27) was
dose-dependently elevated in 293T cells cotransfected with
ID4 (Fig. 2B) and, in addition, significantly elevated in A1207ID4 and A172-ID4 (Fig. 2B), indicating that miR-9* activity was
lower in ID4-overexpressing cells. A 6-bp sequence in the 50 ends of miR-9* was perfectly complementary to SOX2–30 -UTR
(Supplementary Fig. S5A). To determine whether this predicted
binding site was responsible for SOX2 repression, we created
luciferase reporter constructs containing either wild-type
(WT) or miR-9*-binding site-mutated SOX2–30 -UTR (Supplementary Fig. S5A; ref. 17). WT, but not mutated SOX2–30 -UTR,
repressed its reporter activity in LN229-shID4 but increased in
A1207-ID4 (Fig. 2C), indicating that ID4 enhances SOX2 expression, in part, by suppressing miR-9*. The miR-9* transcripts
are located in 3 loci of human chromosomes: chromosomes

Figure 2. ID4 upregulates SOX2 protein by inhibiting miR-9* expression. A, Western blot analysis showed that SOX2, ABCC3, and ABCC6 protein levels were
decreased in LN229-shID4 compared with control LN229-shScrambled and increased in A1207-ID4 and A172-ID4 as compared with their controls. qRT-PCR
was carried out to examine SOX2 mRNA levels in these cells. B, miR-9* levels increased in A1207-ID4 and A172-ID4 and decreased in LN229-shID4. The
luciferase activity of the reporter gene containing 3 copies of the miR-9*–binding motif was dose-dependently elevated in 293T cells after transfecting different
concentrations of ID4. Furthermore, this activity was significantly increased in ID4-overexpressing A1207 and A172 compared with their controls. C, the

and increased in ID4-depleted LN229. Luciferase reporter assays revealed that the transcriptional activity of the reporter gene containing the c1ORF61
promoter was elevated in LN229-shID4 but decreased in A1207-ID4 and A172-ID4; *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01.

1 (hsa-miR-9-1), 5 (hsa-miR-9-2), and 15 (hsa-miR-9-3). In
particular, the hsa-miR-9-1 transcript is located in the intron
region of the C1orf61 gene whereas hsa-miR-9-2 and hsamiR-9-3 transcripts are located in the intergenic region.
Because the C1orf61 gene has 3 conserved "E-box" elements
in its promoter (Supplementary Fig. S5B), we carried out
qRT-PCR to measure C1orf61 mRNA expression and found
that its mRNA level was markedly diminished in A1207-ID4
and A172-ID4 but significantly increased in LN229-shID4
(Fig. 2D). Furthermore, ID4 overexpression decreased the
luciferase activity of the reporter gene containing the
C1orf61 gene promoter and ID4 knockdown enhanced
C1orf61 promoter–luciferase activity (Fig. 2D), indicating
that ID4 suppresses miR-9* expression through transcriptional repression of the C1orf61 gene.

SOX2 promotes anticancer drug resistance through
ABCC3 and ABCC6 expression
We wondered whether SOX2 was associated with ID4mediated chemoresistance to anticancer drugs. Therefore,
we established several SOX2-overexpressing glioma cells
(A1207-SOX2, A172-SOX2, LN18-SOX2, and LN229-SOX2)
by transducing the retroviral vector-encoding SOX2 gene.
In addition, we employed shRNAi to downregulate SOX2 in
LN229 (LN229-shSOX2), which expresses a high level of
endogenous SOX2. All SOX2-overexpressing glioma cells
showed a marked decrease in apoptosis when treated with
BCNU (Fig. 3A). On the contrary, LN229-shSOX2 was significantly sensitive to anticancer-drug-induced apoptosis
when treated with BCNU, etoposide, and staurosporine
(Fig. 3A, far right graph). SOX2, a member of the SRY-related

exerted an antiapoptotic effect through induction of ABCC3

occurred (Fig. 3C). The depletion of these mRNAs in A1207SOX2 and A172-SOX2 resulted in significant resistance to
BCNU (Fig. 3C), indicating that SOX2 causes anticancer drug
resistance by inducing ABC transporters. Among several
putative binding sites for SOX2 in their promoter regions,
2 sites in each ABCC3 and ABCC6 promoter were highly
conserved and contained a predicted SOX2-binding consensus motif (Supplementary Fig. S5C). We created luciferase
reporter genes containing the promoter regions of ABCC3

ID4 regulates anticancer drug resistance via SOX2
activation
To investigate whether ID4 endows chemoresistance to
glioma cells by SOX2-mediated induction of ABCC3 and
ABCC6, we stably depleted SOX2 in ID4-overexpressing cells
(A1207-ID4-shSOX2 and A172-ID4-shSOX2), using shRNAi, or
reconstituted SOX2 in ID4-depleted cells (LN229-shID4-SOX2)
by transduction of a retroviral vector-encoding SOX2 gene that
lacks its own 30 -UTR (to avoid a possible miR-9*–driven
repression) and confirmed SOX2 expression in these cells
using qRT-PCR (Fig. 4A). Notably, Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses revealed that SOX2 expression in
LN229-shID4-SOX2 was similar to that in control LN229
(Fig. 4A; Supplementary Fig. S6). Next, we conducted qRTPCR to determine expression levels of ABCC3 and ABCC6 in
A1207-ID4-shSOX2 and A172-ID4-shSOX2 and found that, as
expected, ABCC3 and ABCC6 in these cells were diminished to
levels similar to those of their parental cells (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, reconstitution of SOX2 in LN229-shID4 resulted in
increases in ABCC3 and ABCC6 expression at levels similar
to those of control cells (Fig. 4B). We then examined the
chemoresistance of A1207-ID4-shSOX2 and A172-ID4-shSOX2
to BCNU and found that SOX2 knockdown in these cells led to
a marked increase in apoptosis (Fig. 4C). Conversely, reconstitution of SOX2 in LN229-shID4 rescued the chemoresistance to BCNU at a level similar to that of parental LN229
(Fig. 4C). In summary, these data indicate that SOX2-mediated
induction of ABCC3 and ABCC6 plays a crucial role in the
acquisition of anticancer drug resistance of ID4-overexpressing cells.
SOX2 promotes tumorigenicity and self-renewal of
glioma cells
SOX2 plays pivotal roles in maintaining stemness properties
of NSCs and GSCs (22, 31, 32). Furthermore, ectopic overexpression of SOX2, along with other reprogramming factors,
including OCT4, KLF4, and c-MYC, reprograms somatic cells
into iPSCs (16). However, the functional role of SOX2 in
gliomagenesis, particularly in GSC biology, has not been
studied. Therefore, we subcutaneously inoculated SOX2-overexpressing glioma cells in immunocompromised mice and
compared their tumorigenic potentials with control cells. We
found that A1207-SOX2 and A172-SOX2 displayed a marked
increase in tumor growth (Fig. 5A and B). Moreover, SOX2
overexpression caused Ink4a/Arf/ astrocytes to have
tumorigenic potential (Supplementary Fig. S7A), indicating
an oncogenic effect of SOX2. A1207-SOX2, A172-SOX2, and
Ink4a/Arf/ astrocyte-SOX2 accelerated tumor sphere formation—a hallmark of GSCs (Fig. 5A and B; Supplementary
Fig. S7B; refs. 6, 7)—when grown in serum-free medium
supplemented with EGF and bFGF, which is a reliable suspension culture condition for NSCs and GSCs to form neurospheres and maintain their stemness (33). Furthermore, these
results imply that SOX2 might be causally connected to ID4mediated switching of glioma cells to iGSCs. To address this
possibility, we examined the tumor sphere–forming ability of
ID4-overexpressing glioma cells with or without SOX2 knockdown. Consistent with our previous study (23), tumor sphere

3416

numbers were significantly increased in A1207-ID4 and A172ID4 compared with their controls. However, SOX2 depletion in
these cells dramatically repressed their tumor sphere–forming
abilities, partially attributed to a decreased proliferation as
determined by BrdU incorporation assay (Fig. 5C; Supplementary Fig. S8A and B).
To further investigate the functional role of SOX2 in the
ID4-driven acquisition of stemness of iGSCs, we carried out
qRT-PCR to examine stem cell markers and their differentiated progeny markers in ID4-overexpressing glioma cells
with or without SOX2 knockdown. Consequently, we observed
that stem cell markers (Nestin, CD133, and CD15) were
markedly increased in A1207-ID4 and A172-ID4 compared
with their controls (Fig. 5C). However, SOX2 knockdown in
these cells dramatically repressed stem cell marker expression
and, instead, induced differentiated lineage marker expression, including GFAP and S100b (astrocyte), Tuj1 (neuron), as
well as NG2 and Olig2 (oligodendrocyte; Fig. 5C). Notably,
GFAP expression was predominantly elevated by SOX2 depletion in A1207-ID4 whereas Tuj1, Olig2, and NG2 levels were
dramatically increased in A172-ID4-shSOX2 (Fig. 5C), suggesting that aberrant differentiation of GSCs into a particular cell
type is not likely to be determined by loss of SOX2. A serial
passage analysis revealed that the tumor sphere–forming
ability of A1207-SOX2 is gradually increased after 3 consecutive passages, although it is less effective than that in A1207ID4. Furthermore, FACS analysis showed that, compared with
controls, stem cell marker–positive cell populations increased
in A1207-ID4 and A1207-SOX2 grown in NSC culture conditions (NBE medium supplemented with EGF and bFGF)
whereas
differentiation
marker-positive
populations
increased in these cells grown in differentiation culture conditions (NBE medium supplemented with 5% FBS) for 7 days
(Fig. 5D). In addition, we found that differentiation markerpositive cell populations decreased in A1207-ID4 and A1207SOX2 in NSC cell culture conditions (Supplementary Fig. S9).
Tumors derived from A1207-ID4 and A1207-SOX2 contained
increased stem cell marker–positive cells compared with
tumors derived from controls (Supplementary Fig. S10A–C).
Together, these data indicate that SOX2 regulates, at least in
part, ID4-driven iGSC genesis and maintenance and that SOX2
can reprogram glioma cells into iGSCs.
The ID4-miR-9*-SOX2 regulatory axis primes ABCC3/6mediated chemoresistance in hGSCs derived from GBM
patients
Consistent with previous observations that serum-free
medium supplemented with EGF and bFGF facilitates maintenance of GSC features whereas media supplemented with
FBS robustly differentiates GSCs into several differentiated
lineages (33), we found that the 5% FBS-containing medium
allowed our hGSCs (hGSC1, hGSC2, and hGSC3; derived from
GBM patients; ref. 24) to be cells expressing various differentiated lineage markers (Fig. 6A; Supplementary Fig. S11).
Furthermore, ID4 and SOX2 protein were markedly reduced in
these differentiated hGSCs (Fig. 6A), indicating a plausible
connection between loss of ID4 and SOX2 and hGSC differentiation. To investigate whether the ID4-miR-9*-SOX2

regulatory axis is also required for ABCC3 and ABCC6 expression in these hGSCs, we depleted ID4 in hGSC1 and hGSC2 and
found that ID4 knockdown resulted in a significant increase in
miR-9* levels but a marked reduction in ABCC3 and ABCC6
expression (Fig. 6B). Similar to verapamil treatment, ID4
depletion led to decrease in side population of hGSCs
(Fig. 6C). Both hGSC1-shID4 and hGSC2-shID4 showed substantial increases in BCNU-induced apoptosis as compared
with their controls (Fig. 6D). Together, these findings suggest
that the ID4-miR-9*-SOX2 regulatory axis plays a crucial role
in controlling ABC transporter–mediated chemoresistance in
both patient-derived hGSCs and human iGSCs.

elevated in A1207-control–driven tumors that were treated
with BCNU every 3 days for a total of 9 days (Fig. 7B;
Supplementary Fig. S12). In addition, we found that ABCC3
and ABCC6 mRNA levels significantly correlated with ID4
levels in human GBM specimens (Fig. 7C).

Discussion
In the present study, we show a novel ID4-miR-9*-SOX2
regulatory pathway, where SOX2 plays crucial roles in controlling (i) the chemoresistance of GSCs by inducing ABCC3
and ABCC6, (ii) acquisition of self-renewal potential in glioma
cells, and (iii) maintenance of stemness in ID4-driven iGSCs
and GSCs derived from GBM patients (Fig. 7D).
In contrast to most ABC transporters (ABCC1, ABCC2,
ABCC4, and ABCC5) that are abundantly expressed in various
anatomic regions of the normal brain, ABCC3 and ABCC6
expressions are rarely detectable in normal brain tissues (34).

ished the sensitivity of cancer cells to anticancer drugs, such
as etoposide, doxorubicin, and daunorubicin, in a cell-type–
dependent manner. However, no previous report has
described the substrate specificity and role of ABCC3 and
ABCC6 in the anticancer drug resistance of GSCs. miRNAs
determine fundamental biological processes and human cancer initiation and progression through negative regulation of
gene expression (15, 35). In particular, several miRNAs are
involved in the development of anticancer drug resistance of
many human malignancies by repressing ABC transporters.
For example, miR-328, hsa-miR-519c, and hsa-miR-520h can
repress ABCG2 expression by directly targeting its 30 -UTR in
breast and pancreatic cancer cells (36–38). However, our
findings revealed that ABCC3 and ABCC6 are not direct
targets for miR-9*; instead, their expression is transcriptionally upregulated by SOX2, which is elevated by ID4-mediated
suppression of miR-9*. Moreover, we found that ABCG2 is
upregulated in several ID4-driven iGSCs and GSCs derived
from patients. Thus, ABCG2 might probably be involved in

ID4-mediated chemoresistance of iGSCs and GSCs to BCNU.
However, the expression of ABCG2 in primary GSCs and ID4driven iGSCs tested in this study differs from that in a previous
report showing that ABCG2 activity in GSCs is determined by
its cell-membrane localization and not by its expression levels
(14). Our findings suggest that ABCC3 and ABCC6 may be
bona fide GSC-relevant ABC transporters that are associated
with chemoresistance because their expression was found to
be elevated in most ID4- and SOX2-driven iGSCs and patientdriven GSCs tested but not in glioma cell lines.
SOX2 and other reprogramming factors, such as Nanog,
OCT4, and c-MYC, are frequently upregulated in poorly differentiated tumors (39) and have a high correlation with tumor
regrowth and metastatic recurrence (40). SOX2 depletion in
GSCs promotes differentiation and losses of stemness and
tumorigenicity (22). TGF-b signaling enhances GSC stemness
and tumorigenicity by inducing SOX4-mediated SOX2 expres-

GSC features and plays a crucial role in the maintenance of
cancer stemness in ID4-driven iGSCs and GSCs derived from
GBM patients. Furthermore, similar to a previous study
revealing that the EWS-FLI-1 oncogene can reprogram primary cells to display the cancer stem cell phenotype by
derepressing miR-145–mediated inhibition of SOX2 (41),
our findings elucidate the induction of SOX2 by ID4-mediated
suppression of miR-9* in GSCs and the sufficiency of SOX2 in
reprogramming glioma cells to generate GSCs. Although
several studies have reported that miR-145 is ubiquitously
expressed in many tissues and functions as a potent SOX2
repressor in ESCs and iPSCs (17, 42, 43), we believe that miR-9*
is a bona fide SOX2 repressor in NSCs and GSCs, because miR9* expression is predominantly restricted in differentiated
brain cells in vivo and in vitro, and is inversely associated
