ABSTRACT
The cell surface glycoprotein CD44 is expressed in cancer cells and has been used
as a therapeutic target in preclinical studies. However, the ubiquitous expression
of CD44 in numerous cell types, including hematopoietic cells, has hindered its
application in targeted therapy. Here, we demonstrated that CD44 was activated on
breast cancer cells but was inactive on normal cells in vitro and in vivo. We analyzed
34 clinical primary tumor and normal breast tissues and demonstrated that CD44
was in an active state on breast cancer cells but in an inactive state on normal cells.
Furthermore, based on the binding property of CD44 with its ligand hyaluronan (HA),
we self-assembled HA-coated nanoparticles and studied their selective targeting
efficacy. Our results indicate that HA-coated nanoparticles bearing the CD44 ligand
selectively targeted cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo, killing breast cancer cells
while sparing normal cells. Our study suggested that the active state of CD44 plays
a crucial role in the selective targeting of breast cancer cells by avoiding nonspecific
toxicity to CD44-quiescent normal cells. These findings may provide a new idea for
the selective targeting of cancer cells in other human cancers.

INTRODUCTION

preclinical and clinical trials of anti-CD44 therapy
have become possible (Patent Nr. 7507537, Patent Nr.
5916561). At present, the most effective strategy for CD44
targeted anti-cancer therapeutics is anti-CD44 antibodies.
The most exciting news to come from such strategies is
that a CD44 antibody-drug conjugate exhibited clinical
successes in both metastatic breast cancer and squamous
cell carcinoma (SCC) [5, 6]. Despite these promising
results, CD44 targeting was not completely successful in
clinical practice [7, 8], and clinical trials involving antiCD44 antibody were halted due to various toxicities [5, 7].
Consistent with clinical limitations, the laboratory
results for CD44 targeting are not convincing. As
mentioned above, in addition to being over-expressed in
tumors, CD44 is also widely expressed in almost every

Breast cancer remains a leading cause of morbidity
and mortality in women worldwide, and the selection of
proper treatment for an individual with a specific type
of breast cancer is urgently needed to improve survival
[1, 2]. Although new specific targets for breast cancer
treatment are rapidly emerging, many problems remain
to be resolved. It is likely that the most common and
serious obstacle regarding current treatments is low target
specificity, which drastically influences the efficacy and
adverse effects. CD44, a cell-surface glycoprotein, is
highly expressed in tumors, especially in breast cancer
[3, 4]. Along with the development of humanized CD44
antibodies by multiple pharmaceutical companies, recent

cell type in humans and mice [9, 10]. Initial trials with
drugs conjugated to CD44 antibodies are complicated by
various toxicities, which are partly due to the fact that
anti-cancer drugs conjugated to a CD44 antibody may
induce toxicity in both cancer and normal cells. Therefore,
the effectiveness and safety of CD44 in targeting
chemotherapy must be clarified.
The main ligand for the CD44 receptor is hyaluronan
(HA), a glycosaminoglycan that is synthesized in a wide
range of sizes up to ~107 Da. HA could act as a targeting
carrier coating on nanoparticles because it is a water
soluble, non-immunogenic polysaccharide with multiple
functional groups available for chemical conjugation. HA
reduces systemic toxicity by delivering a higher relative
dose to tumors in mice [11, 12]. However, most of these
studies focused on the chemical properties of HA and
underestimated its potential to selectively target CD44.
HA acts through CD44 to regulate cell proliferation
and motility. The interaction of CD44 with HA is strongly
influenced by the state of CD44 activation [13, 14]. As
previously reported, CD44 exists in two distinct states
that differ in HA-binding affinity: active or inactive [15].
However, many examples indicate that CD44-positive
cells do not bind HA, whereas only activated CD44
binds and internalizes HA. Inactive CD44 can not bind
HA unless it is activated by appropriate stimuli, such as
numerous cytokines, growth factors, and alterations in
the cellular context [16, 17]. Many types of cells express
CD44 at various levels, yet HA binding is not detectable
[18] or exclusively stimulated under particular conditions
[19]. These reports suggest that CD44 activation at
appropriate times and locations might play a vital role
in biological processes, such as cancer progression, and
could therefore be used as a specific target in anti-cancer
therapy. However, the role of activated CD44 in previous
targeting therapy efforts was not sufficiently addressed.
Thus, it is important to identify differences in CD44 ligand
binding capacities of cancerous and normal tissues or
cells.
In this study, we aimed to investigate the role
of CD44 activation states in targeting therapy to breast
cancer cells. We determined that two different states of
CD44 exist between human breast cancerous and normal
cells from pathological specimens and cell lines. Selfassembling HA-coated nanoparticles were prepared to
selectively target tumor cells with activated CD44 in vivo.
Our study suggests that CD44 on cancer tissues and cancer
cells is considerably more active compared with CD44
from normal control cells and that this activation plays
a crucial role in selectively targeting therapy to breast
cancer cells.

Different activation states of CD44 in clinical
normal and malignant breast tissues
CD44 expression and activation states were
analyzed in 34 frozen normal and cancerous breast
tissue sections. Breast carcinoma tissues were surgically
resected, and normal breast tissues were obtained from
patients who had undergone reduction mammoplasties.
The pathologic characteristics of this series of carcinomas
are presented in Table 1. Immunohistochemical analysis
demonstrated that CD44 was expressed on both cancerous
and normal tissue samples (Fig. 1A). The MSI for CD44
detected on the surface of normal breast tissues (median:
160031.17) did not significantly differ from that of the
MSI for cancerous tissues (median: 158634.25) (Fig. 1B).
To evaluate CD44 activity in clinical samples, we
used the affinity probe biotin-labeled HA, which only
binds to CD44 in its active conformation [24]. The results
demonstrated increased HA binding on cancerous tissues
with a median MSI of 56834.5 compared with minimal
or low binding on the corresponding normal tissue with
a median MSI of 1.9795 (Fig. 1A and 1C), indicating
the presence of two distinct states of CD44 activity
determined by microenvironments.
Furthermore, we examined the relationship between
activated CD44 and tumor grade, histological type, tumor
size, lymph node metastasis stage, age at diagnosis,
estrogen receptor status, progesterone receptor, Her 2
receptor, and Ki 67. Despite the obvious differences
between cancerous and normal breast tissues, no
significant association was observed between activated
CD44 expression and these tumor characteristics (Table
1), indicating no correlation between CD44 activation and
clinical tumor parameters. In addition, further examination
revealed that alterations of CD44 states can occur within
the breast tumor microenvironment (Fig. S1). HA binding
of CD44 on normal cells was observed when normal
cells were co-cultured with breast cancer cells, indicating
that the conversion of CD44 from an inactive state to an
active state (Fig. S1). This result provides evidence for
the specific location of active CD44 within the tumor
microenvironment.

Two CD44 activation states in normal and breast
cancer cell lines
To further confirm that the two activation states
of CD44 are differentially located, we assessed CD44
expression and fl-HA binding activity on four breast
cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, BT-549,

and Hs578T) and four normal cell lines (PBMCs, NIH3T3,
CV-1, and NFs). The peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) from 10 donors and NFs derived from 3 adults
were assessed. The results from flow cytometry analysis
indicated that CD44 expression was abundant in all four
breast cancer cell lines and four normal cell lines; no
significant difference between normal and cancer cells was
noted (Fig. 2A). However, significantly increased fl-HA
binding was observed in cancer cell lines compared with
normal cells (Fig. 2B). These results indicated that the
CD44 activation state differs in normal and cancer cells,
revealing striking similarities to the observations made in
clinical tissues.
To determine whether the CD44 expression pattern is

altered in these four breast cancer cell lines compared with
the four normal cells, we next determined the expression
of CD44 variants. Using a primer pair spanning the entire
variant region in a reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) assay, each transcribed CD44 variant
isoform is theoretically amplified as described previously
[25]. Our results indicate that the CD44 expression pattern
differed between normal cells and cancer cells (Fig. 2C).
Human breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-468, BT-549,
and Hs578T) were characterized by the appearance of
several bands on agarose gel electrophoretograms when
examining the CD44 variant region with a primer pair
spanning the entire variant region. These results were
consistent with previous reports [26]. By contrast, almost

no expression of the CD44v gene was observed in normal
cells (Fig. 2C). Similarly, changes in expression patterns
were detected in normal cells and cancer cells by western
blotting using an immunoblotting antibody against the
standard region of CD44 (Fig. 2D). Although altered CD44
mRNA and protein expression patterns were detected
in three of four cancer cell lines tested, which might be
attributed to the heterogeneity of cancer cell lines, no
obvious difference was noted regarding the fl-HA binding
activity of the four cancer cell lines as analyzed in Fig. 2B,
suggesting that factors other than CD44v expression affect

the different CD44 activation states noted between normal
and cancer cells.

was mixed with the lipid molecules and assembled into
lipid clusters, which were subsequently covalently coated
with HA to form HA-Lipid-PTX nanoparticles. HAfree Lipid-PTX nanoparticles were prepared similarly
with the omission of HA. The particle size distribution
and polydispersity index (PDI) were determined by
light scattering using particle-sizing systems. HA-free
nanoparticles (Lipid-PTX) exhibit size ranges of 100
nm in diameter with a PDI of 0.118, and HA-coated
nanoparticles exhibit size ranges of 120.5 nm in diameter
with a PDI of 0.160. These values are within the range of
those previously reported for paclitaxel carriers [28].
Lipid-PTX clusters and HA-Lipid-PTX exhibited
globular shapes as evidenced by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images (Fig. 3A). In addition, the Zeta potentials
of Lipid-PTX clusters and HA-Lipid-PTX nanoparticles
were -12 mV and -29 mV, respectively, suggesting that the
clustering structure is stabilized by HA coating.

Activated
CD44

internalization of HA-coated nanoparticles

To examine whether HA-coated nanoparticle
treatment selectively increases cytotoxicity in breast
cancer cells via activated CD44, an MTT (3-(4,
5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide)
assay was performed to assess in vitro cytotoxicity.
Normal cells (CV-1) and breast cancer cells (MDAMB-231) were treated with HA-Lipid-PTX and LipidPTX. The results indicate that breast tumor cells (MDAMB-231) with active CD44 appeared more sensitive to the
cytotoxic activity of HA-coated nanoparticles than CD44inactive normal cells (CV-1) (Fig. 3C). MDA-MB-231 cell
growth was hindered, indicative of severe cytotoxicity.
By contrast, CV-1 cell growth was largely unaffected,
indicating only minor cytotoxicity. HA-free nanoparticles
demonstrated low cytotoxicity in each cell line. Cells
treated with an equal dose of HA or free PTX exhibited
minimal effects on growth in each cell line (Fig. 3C).
To further define the role of activated CD44 in cell
cytotoxicity, a blocking experiment on CD44 binding
with HA was performed. Treatment with an anti-CD44
mAb strongly decreased HA-coated nanoparticle-induced
cell cytotoxicity in MDA-MB-231 cells, but no obvious
effects were noted in CV-1 cells (Fig. 3D), suggesting that
activated CD44 mediates the increase in breast cancer cell
selective cytotoxicity.

the

The induction of internalization was analyzed
using a confocal imaging system after incubating the
cells with HA-coated nanoparticles using a fluorescent
marker (coumarin 6) as a model drug. CD44-active breast
tumor cells (MDA-MB-231) exhibited more efficient
internalization of the HA-coated nanoparticles compared
with CD44-inactive normal cells (NIH3T3, CV-1) (Fig.
3B). These results indicate that HA-coated nanoparticles
selectively bind to activated CD44 compared with inactive
CD44. Moreover, the compartmentalization of fluorescent
particles in intracellular vesicles of tumor cells provides
clear evidence for successful endocytosis of HA-coated
nanoparticles.
Additionally, after pre-treatment with free HA
to block the binding site of activated CD44 on the cell
surface, cellular internalization of HA-coated nanoparticles
was significantly decreased, and the level of inhibition
were similar to those observed with CD44 antibody pretreatment in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3B). These results
suggest the specific binding of HA-Lipid-PTX to active
CD44 on the cancer cell surface. However, pre-treatment
with free HA or the blocking CD44 antibody exhibited no
obvious effects on the internalization of nanoparticles in
CD44-inactive NIH3T3 and CV-1 cells. The differential
uptake efficiency of HA-coated nanoparticles observed
between normal and cancer cells is potentially induced by
activated CD44.

Activated CD44 mediates selective targeting in
vivo
In vivo imaging was used to illustrate the selective
targeting of HA-coated nanoparticles to activated CD44
but not resting CD44 in normal tissues in vivo. Qdot800labeled HA-coated nanoparticles were injected into veins
of mice bearing MDA-MB-231 xenografts. This injection
caused an intense fluorescent appearance of the Qdot800
at the tumor site (Fig. 4A), mostly likely due to specific
binding of HA to activated CD44 in the xenografts. Under
identical conditions, systemically administered HAfree control nanoparticles (Lipid-PTX.Qdot800) did not
accumulate at the tumor site (Fig. 4A). PBS-treated mice
bearing MDA-MB-231 xenografts were used as negative
controls.
Organ-specific biodistribution was analyzed to
further assess the effect of activated CD44 on the targeting
selectivity of HA-coated nanoparticles in vivo. For these
experiments, 24 h after the administration of nanoparticles
coated with or without HA, considerably stronger signals
were detected in the tumor regions of mice administered
a HA-coated nanoparticles injection compared with mice
receiving a HA-free nanoparticle injection (Fig. 4B and
4C). Notably, the relative organ uptake of HA-coated
nanoparticles in tumors 24 h post-injection is strikingly

increased compared with other organs (Fig. 4C), thus
demonstrating effective targeting mediated by activated
CD44 in vivo.

selectively targeting CD44 in tumor cells is crucially
needed for this approach to work.
Our experiments regarding the different states
of CD44 activation demonstrate that CD44 is active on
cancerous breast cells but inactive on normal cells. Our
unique data indicate that selective targeting mediated by
HA is dependent on the distinct activation state of CD44. It
is plausible that only active CD44 possesses the capability
to bind with its ligand HA and that inactive CD44 cannot
bind HA [13, 24]. Previously published studies on CD44
expression and CD44-mediated internalization are riddled
with paradoxes and apparent contradictions. Some reports
suggested that the amount of HA internalized in many cell
lines is not directly proportional to CD44 receptor density,
and cells that exhibited 10-fold increased CD44 receptor
expression internalized similar amounts of HA-conjugate
[27]. However, until now, the function of CD44 and its
activation state in the properties of these particular cells
have received little attention.
In this study, we demonstrate that two distinct
CD44 states exist and that these states differ in human
breast cancerous and normal tissue: active CD44 is found
on cancer cells and inactive CD44 is found on normal
cells. All patients with primary invasive ductal carcinoma
of the breast (stage I-III) were diagnosed pathologically
and clinically, and the specimens were obtained before
any treatments were administered. The results indicate
high CD44 expression on both breast cancer tissues and
normal control tissues. However, the HA-binding abilities
of CD44 were significantly higher for cancer tissues
compared with normal tissues, strongly suggesting that a
discordant relationship of CD44 expression and activation
exists between cancerous and normal breast tissues. Our
results also demonstrate that quiescent CD44 on normal
cells could be activated in tumor microenvironments
(Fig. S1 in S1 Supplemental Data), providing additional
evidence for the specific active state of CD44 on tumor
cells. However, the mechanisms for this are not clear.
Previous studies demonstrated that cancer cells typically
produce several variant forms of CD44 in addition to the
standard CD44, whereas some tumor types, e.g., gliomas,
produce mainly the standard form [33]. Other works
indicated that variants of CD44 are significantly amplified
in numerous tumor types compared with normal processes
[34]. However, all forms of CD44 include an N-terminal,
membrane-distal, hyaluronan-binding domain that exhibits
significant homology with other forms, harboring similar
features of “activation” for HA-CD44 interaction. Our
HA-CD44 binding experiments covered all variants of
CD44 for native HA can bind to any activated CD44
variant.
Following findings in human breast tissues, we
performed similar experiments using cultured cells to
further identify the differences regarding CD44 active
states. Among the eight cell lines tested, most of the cells
expressed high levels of CD44. However, the HA-binding

Activated CD44 sensitizes breast cancer to drug
treatment in vivo
We next investigated whether the treatment of
breast tumors with HA-coated nanoparticles inhibits
xenograft growth and sensitize xenografts to paclitaxel
treatment. HA-Lipid-PTX, Lipid-PTX, taxol, or PBS was
administered intravenously into mice with MDA-MB-231
cell xenografts 4 times every 5 days. The group with HAlipid-PTX treatment exhibited significant reduced tumor
volume of xenografts compared with mice treated with
PBS, HA, taxol, or Lipid-PTX at 20, 25 and 30 days (Fig.
5A).
A decrease in body weight is considered a global
marker of toxicity. Therefore, we evaluated weight
changes in mice after intravenous administration of the
nanoparticles. HA-Lipid-PTX nanoparticles were well
tolerated and did not cause any significant decrease in body
weight or obvious skin toxicity (Fig. 5B). In comparison,
mice treated with taxol exhibited reduced body weight
(up to 5% by day 25). All mice were sacrificed on day
30, and tumors were excised for volume measurement
and histological analysis. The tumors from mice in the
HA-Lipid-PTX treatment group were obviously smaller
compared with other groups (Fig. 5A). Histological
analyses by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining
provided additional confirmation that the HA-coated
nanoparticles exhibited marked selective cytotoxicity to
tumor cell xenografts. H&E staining revealed that tumor
sections from the HA-Lipid-PTX treatment group were
considerably less cellular, whereas tumor sections from
other groups contained tightly packed cells (typical of
adenocarcinomas) interspersed with blood sinuses (Fig.
5C).

DISCUSSION
Anti-CD44 antibodies have been exploited for
targeted delivery of anti-cancer agents to several types
of carcinomas, including breast, colorectal, and lung
cancers [29, 30]. Although these antibodies exhibited
some promise, drugs conjugated to CD44 antibodies
caused various toxicities in human patients in initial trials
[7, 8], largely limiting their utility in the clinic. The main
toxicity of mAb-conjugates was directed against skin
and hematologic cells [31, 32], most likely due to CD44
expression in these cells. Therefore, the wide expression
of CD44 in normal tissues is a complicating factor in
CD44 antibody-conjugated drug-induced toxic epidermal
necrolysis and hematologic toxicity, thus making selective
and safe antibody-based cancer therapy impossible. Thus,

capacities significantly differed. Breast cancer cells
exhibited significantly increased binding activity compared
with normal cells, and these results are consistent with the
results from patient-derived tissues. Moreover, our data
revealed that the expression patterns of variant CD44
differed between normal and cancer cells and that cancer
cells were more likely to express CD44v isoforms than
normal cells. CD44v isoforms are implicated in drug
resistance [35], and their expression correlates with
adverse outcomes in patients with breast [36], colon [29]
and gastric carcinoma [37]. However, in the four cancer
cells we assessed, CD44v expression patterns exhibited a
high degree of heterogeneity and were not associated with
HA binding capacities, suggesting that CD44v expression
might not serve as the main cause of the different CD44activation states noted in normal and cancer cells.
Fluorescence microscopy analysis revealed a high level
of internalization of the HA-coated nanoparticles by
breast cancer cells, whereas minimal internalization was
noted in normal fibroblast cells. These results suggest
that HA-coated nanoparticles can distinguish between
the different states of CD44 on normal and cancerous
cells. Furthermore, HA-coated nanoparticles induced
enhanced cytotoxicity in breast cancer cells, whereas no
obvious effects were noted in normal cells. These results
strongly suggest that the unparalleled phenomenon of
CD44 expression and activation might promote selective
CD44 targeting therapy. It is likely that HA distinguishes
activated CD44 on tumor cells from normal cells, and the
use of HA as a selective targeting carrier might serve as a
promising avenue for systemic anti-cancer therapeutics.
As the main ligand for CD44, HA was used as a
drug carrier coating on liposomes or nanoparticles to
deliver drugs [27]. However, for the HA-associated anticancer study, most of the studies focused on the chemical
properties of HA [12, 38]. Few studies have attempted to
investigate the features of CD44. In this study, the targeting
of HA-coated nanoparticles was compared between
cancerous and normal cells in vitro and in vivo. The data
suggested that this carrier system potentially represents
a promising candidate for selectively targeted drug
delivery to the tumor rather than adjacent normal tissues.
To further confirm the differential targeting efficiency of
HA-coated nanoparticles between normal and cancerous
cells, we performed an in vivo experiment wherein a
breast cancer xenograft model was established in nude
mice, and HA-Lipid-PTX nanoparticles were administered
systemically. The HA-Lipid-PTX biodistribution profile in
vivo exhibited significantly increased uptake by the tumor
compared with HA-free nanoparticles. In addition, mice
with high CD44 expression and active breast cancer cells
displayed smaller tumor volumes and increased cellular
necrosis after HA-Lipid-PTX treatment, suggesting it
is a considerably more effective treatment strategy. By
contrast, no obvious cytotoxicity was observed in other
organs. The results suggested that HA-Lipid-PTX induces
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

severe cytotoxicity in CD44-active human breast cancer
cells in vivo and exerts no effect on normal cells and
organs. Therefore, this study suggests that the HA-coated
carrier system might represent a promising candidate for
selectively targeted drug delivery to CD44-active tumors
rather than CD44-quiescent adjacent normal tissues.
In summary, this study demonstrates a novel
approach for selective therapy by nanoparticle targeting
mediated through the interaction of HA with activated
CD44. The selective toxicity of HA-coated nanoparticles
for breast cancer cells demonstrated in this study should
encourage the clinical evaluation of this nanoparticle in
the treatment of breast cancer patients.

(Alabaster, AL, USA). PTX, semisynthetic from Taxus sp.,
minimum 97%, and 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino-propyl)
carbodiimide (EDAC) were purchased from Sigma.
Courain6 and Qdot 800 were purchased from Invitrogen.
All other chemicals were of reagent grade or higher.

Immunohistochemistry
For immunostaining, frozen sections (8 µm) were
prepared, fixed in acetone, air dried, and then stored at
−80℃. After abolishment of endogenous peroxidase
activity (0.3% H2O2, 20 minutes), tissues were
rehydrated with PBS and blocked with 3% BSA in PBS
for 30 minutes. Then, sections were treated with primary
antibodies specific for CD44 for 60 minutes at room
temperature. Detection was achieved with compatibleconjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen, CA, USA) and
Horse radish-peroxidase–conjugated (HRP-conjugated)
ABC amplification system.

Cell culture
Normal cell lines, mouse fibroblast cell line NIH3T3
and monkey kidney cell line CV-1, were bought from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured
15292

Oncotarget

CD44 activation analysis in cell lines

in RPMI-1640 medium. The primary dermal fibroblasts in
normal skin (NFs) derived from 3 adults were obtained and
cultured as previously reported [20]. Human peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were harvested using
Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. Ficoll-Paque PLUS
(GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Chalfont St Giles, UK)
was overlaid with 5mL EDTA blood and centrifuged at
room temperature for 20 minutes at 500g. Cells were then
collected, washed twice with phosphate buffered saline
(PBS). Four human breast tumor cell lines (BT549, MDAMB-231, MDA-MB-468 and T47D) were obtained from
ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 U/
ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. All cells were
grown to 85% confluency for experiments.

Fluorescein-labeled HA (fl-HA) binding was used to
determine the CD44 activation state. Cells were incubated
with 40 µg/ml fl-HA (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for
1 h at 4°C as described previously [22]. Then, the cells
were treated with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)
and washed three times in PBS. After fixation with 1%
paraformaldehyde, plasma membrane-bound fl-HA was
analyzed using a flow cytometer (Beckman-Coulter, Brea,
USA). Cancerous and normal cells were washed with
PBS. Cells were incubated with 40 µg/ml fl-HA for 1 h at
4°C. After washing with PBS, plasma membrane-bound
fl-HA was analyzed using a flow cytometer.

Quantification of the expression of CD44 variants

Preparation of HA-coated nanoparticles

Cells were harvested and total RNA was purified
using TRIzol reagent. For reverse transcription, a random
nonamer-oligo dT combination was used as the primer.
To assess the variable CD44 regions, a PCR reaction was
performed with a human-specific primer pair (forward
primer: 5’-AGT CAC AGA CCT GCC CAA TGC CTT
T, reverse primer: 5’-TTTGCT CCA CCT TCT TGA CTC
CCA TG-3’ [25]. The PCR reaction mixture contained 5 μl
10 × PCR buffer with Mg2+ (Takara), 8 μl dNTP mix (2.5
mM each), 2.5 μl DNA polymerase (5 U/μl), 2 μl of each
primer, 2 μl cDNA and 28.5 μl sterilized water for a final
volume of 50 μl. The cycling conditions were 95°C for 5
min; 95°C for 30 sec, 52°C for 1 min, and 65°C for 2 min
for 40 cycles; and an extension step at 65°C for 5 min.
PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and
detected with a Gel Doc 2000 (Bio-Rad) after ethidium
bromide staining.
Total cell lysates were collected, and equal
quantities of protein were separated via 8% sodium
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE) and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride
(PVDF) membrane. PVDF membranes were blocked with
Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 5% skimmed milk
powder for 1 h, washed for 1 h in TBS, and incubated with
CD44 (156–3C11, Cell Signal) or β-tubulin monoclonal
antibody (mAb, Cell Signal) at 4°C for 3 h. Then, the
membranes were washed with TBS/Tween 20 (TBS/T)
buffer three times (5 min each time) and incubated with
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated polyclonal
secondary antibody for 1 h. The membranes were
developed using the enhanced plus chemiluminescence
assay (Thermo, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Images were analyzed using Image Pro-Plus
6.0.

Nanoparticles preparation was performed as our
previously reported protocol with some modifications(21).
HA was dissolved in acetate buffer (0.1M, pH 4.5) to a
final concentration of 2 mg/ml and pre-activated by
incubation with EDACat the concentration of 40 mg/ml
for 2 h at 37℃. PTX and lipids (DLPE: DLPG mole ratio
of 7:3) were dissolved in ethanol separately, then mixed
together. Drug loading was at 1:4 drug-lipid (w/w). The
solution was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure
in a Buchi Rotary Evaporator Vacuum System, hydrated
by sterile water, then heated at 45℃ for 2 h and sonicated
for 10 min in a bath sonicator. The activated HA was
added to the lipid-drug suspension with pH adjusted to
9.0 by adding NaOH and incubated over night at 37℃.
Excess reactive agents and by-products were removed by
extensive dialysis against ddH2O, pH 8.2.

CD44 expression analysis in cell lines
Cultured cells were harvested and washed with
washing buffer (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4).
A single cell suspension (106 cells/ml) was incubated
with specific antibodies or isotope control antibodies on
ice for 1 h. Cells were washed three times with washing
buffer, and 1 µl of the anti-CD44 antibody was added for
1 h on ice. Cells were analyzed using a flow cytometer
(Beckman-Coulter, Brea, USA), and at least 6,000
cells were analyzed per sample. All experiments were
performed at least twice.

Tumor xenograft mouse model

Statistical analysis

All protocols involving mice were evaluated and
approved by our Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee and performed under veterinary supervision.
The breast cancer xenograft model was established in
nude mice by injecting MDA-MB-231 cells as previously
described [23]. Nude mice at 5 to 6 weeks of age received
a subcutaneous injection of 1.0 × 106 MDA-MB-231
cells. Tumor growth was monitored by palpation, and
the date of detectable tumor onset was noted. Tumor
size was measured with calipers, and tumor volume
was calculated based on the assumption of an ellipsoid
shape. Representative data were obtained from five
mice per experimental group, and the entire experiment
was repeated in three independent trials. Mice received
intravenous injections of PBS (as a negative control), taxol
(as a positive control), HA-Lipid-PTX, or HA-free LipidPTX 4 times every 5 days. Tumor growth and mouse body
weight were monitored until day 30, at which time the
mice were sacrificed, and the tumor tissues were excised
for histological analysis.

CD44 expression and activation levels were
analyzed by integral optical density (IOD) values with
Image Pro Plus V6.0 for Windows (Media Cybernetics,
Inc., Rockville, MD, USA). Briefly, after intensity
rectification, IODs were obtained as the ratio of the sum
optical density (OD) to the sum area. Most of the data
were expressed as a median or a range, and the median
was presented as the mean staining intensity (MSI). MannWhitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to determine
whether the association between activated CD44 and
breast cancer progression was modified by other factors.
The following covariates were included in the analyses:
tumor grade (categorized as grade 1, 2, or > grade 3),
histological type (categorized as invasive duct carcinoma
vs. non-invasive duct carcinoma), tumor size (categorized
as a grade 1, 2, or > grade 3), lymph node metastasis stage
(categorized as no vs. yes), age at diagnosis (categorized
as < 50 years vs. ≥ 50 years), estrogen receptor status
(categorized as positive vs. negative), progesterone
receptor (categorized as positive vs. negative), HER2
(human epidermal growth factor) (categorized as positive
vs. negative), and Ki 67 (categorized as < 20% vs. ≥ 20%).
Statistical significance in this study was set at P < 0.05,
and all of the reported P-values are 2 tailed. All analyses
were performed with SPSS v.16 for Windows (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA) or SigmaPlot v12 for Windows (Systat
Software, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA).

In
vivo
targeting
characteristics
and
biodistribution of HA-coated nanoparticles
The biodistribution and tumor accumulation profiles
in live animals were imaged using the IVIS Imaging
system (Xenogen 200). A 670 nm-pulsed laser diode was
used for the excitation, and the Qdot800 fluorescence
images were obtained using a 790-nm emission filter. To
estimate the time-dependent excretion profile, the total
Qdot fluorescence intensity per selected region (1000
mm2) in the entire body was calculated as a function of
time. The tumor targeting characteristics of HA-NPs were
evaluated by measuring the Qdot fluorescence intensity
at the tumor site (40 mm2). All data were calculated
using the region of interest (ROI) function in the
Analysis Workstation software (ART Advanced Research
Technologies Inc., Montreal, Canada), and values are
presented as the mean ± SE (standard error) for groups of
three animals.
Major organs and tumors were dissected from
MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice 24 h after intravenous
injection of HA-coated nanoparticles. Fluorescence
images of dissected organs and tumors were obtained
using an IVIS imaging system. The tissue distribution
of nanoparticles was quantified by measuring Qdot800
fluorescence intensity at the ROI. All values are expressed
as the mean ± SE for groups of three animals.

Statement of translational relevance
Breast cancer is one of the most aggressive types of
cancer, and nonspecific toxicity to normal tissues is the
greatest challenge in targeted therapy. Few therapeutic
approaches have proved to be effective on breast tumortargeting. Through the study of patient-derived tumor
specimens, we discovered that CD44 is active on breast
cancer cells but inactive on normal cells. Our work
15294

Oncotarget

demonstrates that hyaluronan (HA), the principal CD44
ligand, can be used as a drug carrier to selectively target
cancerous cells, thus preventing nonspecific toxicity
to quiescent normal cells. Our study may provide new
insight for targeting chemotherapy, particularly tumors
with highly expressed and activated CD44.
