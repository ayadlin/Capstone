BACKGROUND: The value of pretreatment (initial) prostate-specific antigen (iPSA) and biochemical recurrence (BR) as prognostic factors for survival remains unclear. The authors sought to determine why using
randomized trial data with 7-year minimum follow-up. METHODS: In the Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology
Group 96.01 trial, 802 men with T2b, T2c, T3, or T4 N0 prostate cancer (PC) were randomized to radiotherapy alone or with 3 or 6 months neoadjuvant androgen deprivation between 1996 and 2000. Cox modeling
was used to identify outcome predictors at follow-up landmark points. RESULTS: Higher iPSA was found to
be a potent predictor of BR–free survival (P < .01) but was not prognostic for prostate cancer–specific survival (PCSS) from randomization. Patients experiencing BR had unfavorable initial prognostic factors compared with patients who did not. After BR, these factors were not prognostic for PC death in models
adjusted for time to BR (TTBR). In these models, TTBR predicted PCSS more satisfactorily than the occurrence of BR itself. Survival probability 5 years after BR exceeded 90% for men with TTBR 4 years; however, it dropped to 44%  6% for men with TTBR <1 year. After BR, rapid PSA doubling time (DT), low
iPSA, and short TTBR were identified as the most important predictors of inferior PCSS. CONCLUSIONS:
When BR occurs, prognostic factors for survival change. Low iPSA, short TTBR, and rapid PSA DT take
over at this point, providing reasons why iPSA and occurrence of BR alone predict PCSS unsatisfactorily.

Original Article

It has long been recognized that a patient’s pretreatment
(initial) prostate-specific antigen (iPSA) level is a good
predictor of biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS)
after radical prostatectomy1-4 or curative radiotherapy.5-9
Its value in predicting prostate cancer (PC)-specific survival (PCSS) has been less clear. iPSA was a powerful predictor of BRFS, but did not predict PCSS in the TransTasman Radiation Oncology Group 96.01 trial. Comprehensive longitudinal PSA histories, failure site details, and
secondary therapeutic intervention (STI) outcome data
were generated by this trial.
The value of biochemical recurrence (BR) by itself
as a predictor of PCSS has been questioned in recent
years,5,10–13 because survival after BR is highly variable.
The most straightforward answer to the question, ‘‘What
is 5-year survival after BR?’’ is ‘‘Anything between 25 and
100%!’’
The 96.01 trial data have allowed us to determine
how iPSA, and BR and its timing, relate to PCSS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

PSA rise should continue after Phoenix BR over a 6month period. Death was attributable to PC if it occurred
in the context of progressive PC.
STI refers to any anticancer therapy initiated at or
after BR. Time to STI was defined as months from BR to
start date of STI.
The trial’s follow-up schedule has been described
previously.14 Rising PSA levels were monitored every
2 months. Investigations, including biopsy, computed tomography scanning, chest x-ray, and isotope bone scan,
were mandated by suggestive symptoms, or if PSA levels
reached 20 ng/mL. Recurrence diagnosis guidelines
were established in 1999 to encourage identification of
failure site before initiation of STI.

PSA Doubling Time Estimation
PSA doubling time (DT) estimates were derived using
PSA values between Phoenix BR and the initiation of STI
or last contact if STI had not been commenced. Estimates
were obtained from the slope of the regression line of best
fit through the log-transformed PSA values selected.

Study Design
All patients provided written informed consent before
recruitment to this randomized controlled trial.
The trial was opened in 1996 after institutional ethical approval of the protocol at participating Australian
and New Zealand sites. A total of 802 eligible patients
receiving radiotherapy (XRT) (66 grays [Gy] delivered
using 2-Gy daily fractions) for locally advanced PC were
randomized to receive 0, 3, or 6 months neoadjuvant
maximal short-term androgen deprivation (STAD).
Detailed study design is described elsewhere.14 Patients
were stratified by age (<70 years, 70-80 years, or >80
years), stage (T2b/T2c or T3/T4), tumor differentiation
(well, moderate, or poor), and initial PSA level (<20 or
20 ng/mL).

Endpoints and Follow-up
Key endpoints were BRFS and PCSS. BR was defined
using a modification of the Phoenix method.15-18 Time to
BR (TTBR) using the Phoenix definition is years from
end of XRT to a PSA rise of 2 ng/mL above the post-treatment nadir value. The modification stipulated that the

Analytical Strategy
To understand why iPSA predicts BRFS but not PCSS,
PCSS probability was estimated from randomization and
Phoenix BR, adjusting for covariates that might be of
prognostic importance at these time points (ie, treatment
arm, stratification variables, TTBR, PSA DT, and initiation of STI). Because TTBR is known to predict PCSS,
we sought to determine whether it has better predictive
value than the occurrence of BR itself by comparing models of PCSS, 1 including the pretreatment prognostic variables alone and the other with the addition of TTBR as a
categoric variable. In the first pair of analyses, PCSS was
measured from time of Phoenix BR, and these nested
models were compared using the likelihood ratio test to
determine whether the inclusion of TTBR improved the
original model.
In the second pair of analyses, PCSS was measured
from randomization using BR as a time-dependent covariate, defined as a binary (no/yes) variable in 1 model and
as a TTBR categoric variable in the other. These 2 nonnested models were compared using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC),19 which assigns a score to each
Cancer

PSA and Prognosis/Denham et al

model based on its log-likelihood and number of parameters. When 2 models are compared in this way, the
model with the lowest AIC score is preferred, particularly
if its AIC score is >10 less than its immediate rival, indicating that the model is highly likely to be superior to its
rivals from a statistical perspective. The AIC therefore
determined if replacement of the BR (no/yes) variable by
the time to BR categoric variable provided a better model
for PCSS from randomization.

Statistical Methods
Time to endpoint events was derived by the KaplanMeier technique.20 In BRFS and PCSS analyses, patients
lost to follow-up or who died of unknown causes were
censored at time of last follow-up or death if they
remained continuously free of any sign of PC since treatment. Unadjusted and adjusted hazards ratios (HRs) and
95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were obtained from
Cox proportional hazards models.21 All Cox models
were adjusted for age (continuous), iPSA (<10, 10 and
<20, 20 and <50, or 50 ng/mL), Gleason score
(GS) (2-6, 7, or 8-10), stage (T2b, T2c, or T3/T4), and
treatment arm. BR, TTBR, and PSA DT were treated as
categoric covariates in all survival models as described
below. In this dataset, hazard of cancer death from randomization does not correlate linearly with TTBR or
PSA DT, and the hazard for men with TTBR 4 years
or PSA DT 24 months was similar to that for men
without BR. TTBR was therefore converted into a categoric variable with 5 categories: <1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to
4, and 4 years or no BR. PSA DT was constructed as a
categoric variable on the basis of cut points shown to
have discriminative value (3, 6, and 12 months). Men
who experienced BR but whose PSA DT could not be
estimated (usually because STI was commenced immediately) had a hazards of cancer death similar to men with
PSA DT in the range of 3 to 6 months. The variable
comprised 5 categories: <3 months, 3 to 6 months and
BR without PSA DT estimated, 6 to 12 months, 12 to
24 months, and 24 months.
In models comparing the prognostic importance of
BR with TTBR from randomization, these variables were
treated as time-dependent covariates. BR was coded as a
binary (no/yes) covariate. TTBR was coded as a categoric
variable using the cut points described above.

The prognostic impact of STI was adjusted for by
treating STI as a time-dependent binary covariate (no/
yes) with time measured from Phoenix BR. In these models, age was determined at Phoenix BR and was coded as a
continuous covariate.
Univariate comparisons between subgroups were
assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test or the chisquare test. In Cox regression analyses, significance was
determined by the Wald test. All analyses involving trial
arms were conducted on an ‘‘intention to treat’’ basis,
and 2-sided probability levels <.05 were considered to
be statistically significant. The closeout date was June 30,
2007.

RESULTS
In Table 1, a breakdown of prognostic characteristics of
the 96.01 trial population is provided at randomization,
Phoenix BR, STI, and PC death. Figure 1 presents a
CONSORT diagram indicating number of patients failing protocol treatment and receiving STI. Of the total
802 eligible men, 454 (57%) failed primary treatment
(436 [54%] with BR), 342 (43%) received STI, and 241
(30%) died (125 [16%] because of PC). Before analyses,
an additional 6 patients (2 unknown deaths and 4 losses
to follow-up) were reclassified as PC deaths because of a
history of progressive disease.

Pretreatment Prognostic Factors
Univariate analyses indicated wide separation between
iPSA subgroupings for BRFS (Fig. 2A), indicating a
strong prognostic correlation, but with limited separation for PCSS (Fig. 2B) suggesting a weak correlation.
This was confirmed in Cox proportional hazards models
(not shown) with iPSA as a categoric variable, and
adjusting for pretreatment age, GS, stage, and treatment
arm. In these models, increasing iPSA category was
found to be a powerful independent predictor of BRFS,
with HRs increasing from 1.58 to 3.80 (all P values
<.01) relative to the PSA <10 ng/mL category, but not
for PCSS.
All other pretreatment variables were independent
predictors of BRFS. In the model for PCSS from randomization, increasing GS grouping (GS7: HR, 1.96; 95% CI,
1.27-3.04 [P ¼ .003]; GS8-10: HR, 3.04; 95%CI,

of modeling PCSS from randomization using the same
covariates plus treatment arm, the Cox model of PCSS
from Phoenix BR produced markedly different results.
This model, which is shown in Table 2, indicated that
previously important covariates had reduced effect sizes.
Gleason grouping and T classification were seen to have
less influence on survival. Remarkably, however, increasing PSA category became a predictor of increasing survival
probability. In particular, men with iPSA <10 ng/mL
were found to have significantly inferior PCSS after BR
relative to men in all iPSA categories 10 ng/mL. This
prognostic effect is shown in Figure 3A. In exploratory
Cox models of PCSS (not shown), we found that iPSA
levels 10 ng/mL were associated with decreased hazard
of PC death in men with tumors with a GS of 7 to 10
(HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.29-0.77 [P ¼ .003]), but not in
men with tumors with a GS of 2 to 6 (HR, 0.75; 95% CI,
0.25-2.12 [P ¼ .60]).
A second model (shown in Table 3) was constructed
to determine whether TTBR could assist in explaining
variation in the data. A likelihood ratio test comparison
between the 2 models, shown in Tables 2 and 3, indicated
that the inclusion of TTBR had produced a significantly
superior model (likelihood ratio chi-square test, 47.14;
Cancer

October 1, 2009

P < .0001). In this second model, increasing TTBR was
seen to decrease the hazards of PC death, with HRs for
men in TTBR categories <1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 4
years decreasing from 16.82 to 2.20 relative to the TTBR
4 year category. Other important features of this model
include the disappearance of the prognostic significance
of GS and T classification. Survival expectation 5 years after Phoenix BR was 44%  6% for men with TTBR <1
year; however, for men with TTBR 4 years, it was 93%
 5% (Fig. 3B). Similar findings were obtained when
these 2 models were corrected for STI using a time-dependent covariate based on time from Phoenix BR to initiation of STI (data not shown).
These findings lead us to determine whether TTBR
has greater prognostic potential for PC death than BR as
an event from the time of randomization. In the 2 models
presented in Tables 4 and 5, BR as a time-dependent binary (no/yes) covariate has been compared with TTBR as
a categoric time-dependent covariate, after adjusting for
treatment arm and stratification variables. As a time-dependent binary (no/yes) covariate, BR is associated with
an increased hazard of PC death (HR, 81.6; 95% CI,
23.1-288 [P < .0001]) (Table 4). As a time-dependent
categoric variable, decreasing TTBR is associated with

together, the 2 pairs of models (Tables 2 and 3, and Tables
4 and 5) indicate that TTBR has far greater prognostic
value than the occurrence of BR itself.

increasing hazards of early PC death. The TTBR 4 year
category is associated with a very low hazard of PC death,
whereas decreasing TTBR categories are associated with
continuously increasing hazards of PC death (from 12.6
to 186.7). An objective comparison of the BR and TTBR
models using the AIC indicated that the model with
TTBR as a categoric variable produced a superior description of the data. The AICs for the 2 models were 1421
and 1337, respectively, resulting in a (very large) differ4482

In Table 6, the prognostic impact of PSA DT and the initiation of STI were assessed in a model of PCSS from
Phoenix BR including covariates age at BR, pretreatment
variables, treatment arm, and time to Phoenix BR (as a
categoric variable). In this analysis, decreasing PSA DT
emerged as the strongest predictor of early cancer death.
Decreasing TTBR category remained prognostic, but at
lower HRs than in earlier models. Increasing age was
found to be a significant, but weak, predictor of inferior
survival.
The correlation between PSA DT and PCSS is
depicted in Figure 4. Survival probability 5 years after
Phoenix BR was 32%  7% for men with a PSA DT <3
months, but was 95%  5% in men with PSA DTs 24
months.

DISCUSSION
It is commonly accepted that disease recurrence after primary treatment selects out a subgroup of patients with
poor prognostic characteristics. However, to our knowledge, less attention has been devoted to the way prognostic characteristics themselves change when disease
recurrence occurs. In our prospectively collected trial
dataset, prognostic factors for early cancer death were
observed to change dramatically at BR. Highly prognostic
Cancer

factors at randomization, such as high GS grouping and T
classification, lost their prognostic importance, whereas
factors such as shorter TTBR, PSA DT, and low iPSA
became powerful predictors of PC death at this time
point. These findings explain some important paradoxes.
In our dataset, increasing iPSA values before initial therapy are strongly associated with an increasing probability
of BR. Because death from PC rarely occurs unless BR
occurs, the finding in our dataset and others that iPSA
does not predict early cancer death after initial therapy
appears paradoxical. By demonstrating that iPSA levels
10 ng/mL are favorable prognostic factors when compared with levels <10 ng/mL once BR has occurred, we
provide an explanation. Our findings also explain why the
occurrence of BR is an unsatisfactory predictor of subsequent survival. We have shown that prognostic factors
that become apparent at BR, namely TTBR and PSA DT,
are far more satisfactory predictors of subsequent cancer

death than the occurrence of BR itself. Survival expectations 5 years after Phoenix BR were 44% for men with
TTBR <1 year and 32% for those with PSA DT values
<3 months. For men with TTBR 4 or PSA DT 24
months, survival probability exceeded 90%; 8 years after
randomization, the corresponding probabilities were
100% and 95%, respectively, which is very similar to the
98% probability for men who never experienced BR.
The adverse prognostic significance of shorter
TTBR and PSA DT is not difficult to understand. Shorter
disease-free interval after initial treatment is strongly predictive of early cancer death for most recurrent malignancies, and TTBR is an expression of disease-free interval.
Conversely, short PSA DT is known to be associated with
the progression of occult metastatic disease and rapid proliferation. Together with bulky invasive primary tumors,
these are all well-recognized factors that contribute not
only to an early disease recurrence but to an early death after disease recurrence.
At first sight, the adverse prognostic significance of
iPSA values <10 ng/mL appears difficult to explain.
However, it is widely recognized within the clinical com4484

munity that high-grade tumors associated with low serum
PSA levels are particularly aggressive and have a poor
prognosis. Laboratory studies suggest that such tumors
are likely to be more common than appearances suggest.
Stege et al22 found an inverse correlation between serum
and tissue PSA levels, suggesting that serum PSA concentrations reflect leakage of PSA into the circulation because
of disruptions of the malignant epithelial basement membrane and to the dysfunctional tumor microvasculature,
rather than intracellular PSA concentrations. In highgrade tumors with poor outcomes, low tissue PSA concentrations were found, whereas in good-prognosis, lowgrade tumors the reverse was true. Not surprisingly, tumor
tissue PSA concentrations were found to be a far better
predictor of adverse prognostic features and poor outcome
than serum PSA levels. In men with PSA levels <10 ng/
mL, Steuber et al23 also found that PSA level is an unsatisfactory predictor of extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, and BR. However, in contrast, serum human

kallikrein 2 concentration was greatly superior, raising
hopes that this marker may have an important future role
in pretreatment assessment.
Although not particularly common, aggressive
tumors associated with low PSA levels are more abundant
in a population of men with locally advanced cancers,
such as the current study population, than in a population
of men with earlier cancers, in which pretreatment PSA
levels <10 ng/mL are commonplace. Because the most
aggressive tumors will be the first to recur, these tumors
will be even more abundant in men with locally advanced
cancers who have experienced BR, as in our study group.
Therefore, our analyses are doing nothing more than

exposing the finding that there is a modestly sized subgroup of men with extremely aggressive tumors, who at
the time of presentation have locally advanced tumors
with low serum PSA levels. They also replicate a finding
made in other studies24-31 that pretreatment PSA levels
>10 ng/mL have no prognostic significance when BR
occurs and PSA levels are low. Because the majority of
these studies have involved men undergoing prostatectomy, with less advanced cancers than in the present
study, it is not surprising that the prognostic significance
of pretreatment PSA at the time of BR has not attracted
attention previously.
Most previous studies have concluded that high
tumor grade is an adverse prognostic feature after
BR.24,26-28,30,31 This contrasts with our experience and
could relate to differences in case composition between
these series and ours. For example, the relative prognostic
importance of tumor grade could be greater in men
selected for radical prostatectomy, or it could also relate to
the more accurate tumor grading that is possible from
prostatectomy specimens.
In conclusion, the 96.01 trial data indicate that factors predicting early PC death at the time of disease recurrence reflect unfavorable biologic characteristics in the
recurrent tumor (shorter TTBR, rapid PSA DT, and low
iPSA) and are different from the factors that determine

outcome before initial treatment. In particular, high
iPSA, which is an important predictor of BR after initial
treatment, is not a predictor of early PC death after disease
recurrence. Furthermore, TTBR is a far better indicator
of prognosis than the occurrence of BR itself. These findings explain why iPSA and the occurrence of BR are
unsatisfactory predictors of PC mortality.
