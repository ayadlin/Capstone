Concept and Viability of Androgen Annihilation
for Advanced Prostate Cancer
James L. Mohler, MD1,2

There remains no standard of care for patients with a rising prostate-specific antigen level after radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy but who have no radiographic metastases, even though this is the second largest group of patients with prostate cancer (CaP) in
the United States. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) may cure some men with advanced CaP based on single-institution series
and a randomized clinical trial of immediate versus delayed ADT for men found to have pelvic lymph node metastasis at the time of
radical prostatectomy. ADT may be more effective when initiated for minimal disease burden, which can be detected using PSA after
radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy, and if more complete disruption of the androgen axis using newer agents decreases the
chance that androgen-sensitive cells survive to adapt to a low-androgen environment. Androgens may be “annihilated” simultaneously using a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone antagonist or agonist to inhibit testicular production of testosterone, a
P45017A1 (CYP17A1) inhibitor to diminish metabolism of testosterone via the adrenal pathway and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) via the
backdoor pathway, a 5a-reductase (SRD5A) inhibitor to diminish testosterone reduction to DHT and backdoor metabolism of progesterone substrates to DHT, and a newer antiandrogen to compete better with DHT for the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain.
Early initiation of androgen annihilation for induction as part of planned intermittent ADT should be safe, may reduce tumor burden
below a threshold that allows eradication by the immune system, and may cure many men who have failed definitive local therapy.

INTRODUCTION
The Clinical Challenge Posed by Advanced Prostate Cancer

Earlier detection of prostate cancer (CaP) due to increased awareness and use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has
changed the presentation of CaP from mostly advanced to mostly localized. In spite of earlier detection and improved local
therapy, approximately 30% of men fail potentially curative treatment and CaP remains the second most common cause
of death in American men. In 2013, it was estimated that 29,720 men would die of CaP in the United States.1 PSA can be
used to identify patients who have failed radiotherapy or surgery, who are likely to develop metastatic disease, and who
have minimal tumor burden. There remains no standard of care for patients with rising PSA but who have no radiographic
metastases, even though this is the second largest group of patients with CaP in the United States.
Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Advanced CaP

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been the standard initial therapy for metastatic disease for more than 6 decades,2
but it is considered palliative and is associated with long-term cardiovascular and metabolic risks. Continuous use of ADT
predisposes to weight gain, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, metabolic syndrome,
osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and cognitive decline.3-5 An alternative approach is to reserve
ADT until the time of metastatic disease progression and=or symptomatic disease. A meta-analysis informed the American
Society of Clinical Oncology Guideline that concluded immediate compared with deferred ADT decreased CaP-specific
mortality but increased nonspecific CaP-specific mortality, and thus had no effect on overall survival.6 CaP recurs during
ADT due to continued transactivation of androgen receptor.7 Elevated levels of androgen receptor8 or molecular alterations in androgen receptor can increase response to low (castrate) levels of androgens. More recently, CaP has been found
to synthesize testicular androgens,7,9 most likely from dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione,10-12 weak androgens

Intraprostatic dihydrotestosterone (DHT) without testosterone as a precursor may result from the backdoor pathway, especially when androgen metabolism pathways are
altered by treatment.15-17 These new insights into the
mechanisms of failure of ADT allow speculation that an

adjuvant therapy for patients with high-risk localized disease. Immediate ADT improved survival and may have
cured some men who were found to have pelvic lymph
node metastases at the time of radical prostatectomy; 17
patients (36%) who were immediately treated versus 28
patients (55%) who received delayed ADT had died with
a median follow-up of 11.9 years.18 Benefit also was demonstrated when neoadjuvant=concurrent=adjuvant ADT
was used with radiotherapy for patients with locally
advanced or high-risk disease.19-21 The ADT regimens
among the radiation trials varied from 2 years to lifelong
therapy. The optimal duration of ADT needed to achieve
a survival benefit is not known, and the benefits observed
may derive from ADT improving the efficacy of local
therapy or ADT controlling micrometastases.
An intermediate position is to use ADT to induce
remission but then follow an intermittent ADT program
to minimize side effects while still providing the benefits
of ADT. A review of 19 published phase 2 studies and interim results from 8 phase 3 studies suggests that intermittent ADT reduces side effects by decreasing exposure to
ADT while not adversely impacting survival.22 A natural
extension of this logic is to use intermittent ADT earlier
in the disease, which allows an opportunity to determine
whether induction ADT induces remission that can be labeled cure when the PSA criterion for a second cycle of
intermittent ADT is never reached.

Can More Complete ADT Cure CaP?

Serum PSA levels can be used to identify patients who
have failed radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy and
have minimal tumor burden. No randomized trial to date
has examined the benefits of administering ADT versus
observing patients who have developed biochemical disease recurrence, but because ADT is the only treatment
available to community oncologists and urologists, it is
becoming the de facto standard treatment. Adding additional agents to enhance standard ADT has the potential
to increase the extent and duration of response to ADT
and even cure some men with detectable PSA after surgery
or radiotherapy for clinically localized CaP.
Metastatic or locally advanced CaP (Fig. 2, left column) is treated with ADT, which is considered delayed
ADT. The extent of response is determined by the relative
distribution of CaP cells among 3 compartments.
Androgen-dependent CaP cells undergo apoptosis that
decreases tumor volume.2 Androgen-sensitive CaP cells
survive and remain static.23,24 The androgen-sensitive
cells could adapt to a castrate androgen microenvironment by amplifying,25 hypersensitizing,26 or mutating27
their androgen receptor to allow transactivation by weak
adrenal androgens or castrate levels of testicular androgens. In addition, these androgen-sensitive cells could alter their androgen metabolism pathway to produce
testicular androgens7 from weak adrenal androgens.10

Figure 3. Androgen annihilation is shown delivered by simultaneous use of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone
agonist or antagonist (1), cytochrome P45017A1 (CYP17A1)
inhibitor (2), SRD5A inhibitor (3), and antiandrogen (4). T indicates testosterone; DHT, dihydrotestosterone; AR, androgen
receptor.

Androgen-independent CaP cells not only survive ADT
but continue to grow. The volume and growth rate of
androgen-independent CaP cells and the rate of adaptation of androgen-sensitive CaP cells to castrate levels of
testicular androgens and their subsequent growth rate
determine the duration of response to ADT.
Radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy may control
CaP within the prostate or radiation field, respectively.
CaP that remains after failed local therapy has a reduced tumor volume that is composed of a similar distribution of
CaP cells among the androgen-dependent, androgen-sensitive, and androgen-independent phenotypes (Fig. 2, right
column). Application of ADT would eliminate androgendependent CaP cells so that tumor volume declines to the
volume of the androgen-sensitive and androgenindependent CaP cells. Androgen-dependent CaP cells
most likely fail to survive castrate levels of circulating
androgens; reductions beyond a testosterone threshold produced no further declines in tumor volumes in preclinical
studies.28 However, the effect of further reduction in circulating and tissue testicular androgens using new agents
remains unclear.29 A preclinical finding supports this concept; the androgen-sensitive Dunning H tumor could be
cured only when ADT was combined with chemotherapy
when treatment was initiated at low tumor volumes.23 Tumor volume after ADT may be reduced further if the
androgen-sensitive CaP cell compartment is reduced. The
androgen-sensitive CaP cell compartment could be reduced
if circulating androgens were lowered further, if production

of testicular androgens by intracrine metabolism was curtailed, and if more effective androgen receptor blockade
caused some or all of these cells to undergo apoptosis before
they adapted and grew in a castrate microenvironment.
Androgen annihilation (Fig. 3) attempts to deprive
CaP cells that are “hanging on” after standard ADT of the
necessary mechanisms to survive and adapt to their new
castrate microenvironment by intensifying the attack on
the androgen axis. Further attack on the androgen axis
may prevent or decrease the likelihood of androgensensitive CaP cells adapting to castrate levels of testicular
androgens by impairing the changes in androgen metabolism necessary to produce testicular androgens from weak
adrenal androgens, by either augmenting the adrenal
(CYP17A1) or backdoor (SRD5A and CYP17A1) pathways. Immediate application of androgen annihilation
may reduce residual tumor volume to that of only the
androgen-independent CaP cells. Hence, the timing of
the initiation of ADT as well as the extent of the response
to ADT will impact the tumor volume that remains after
failed local therapy and ADT. Cure could result if the
remaining tumor volume composed of only androgenindependent CaP cells was below a threshold that could
be dealt with immunologically.
Can the Immune System “Finish the Job,”
Especially When Tumor Volume is Low?

ADT causes apoptosis of androgen-dependent CaP cells
that should deliver intracellular antigens to the immune
system. Theoretically, ADT may autovaccinate one
against one’s own CaP. Preclinical data provide support
for the concept of combining ADT and immunotherapy.30,31 Neoadjuvant ADT was associated with infiltration of the prostate by lymphocytes, macrophages, and
dendritic cells and inflammation.32 The mechanisms
whereby ADT can improve immune response by increasing T cells produced by the thymus, increasing B cells produced by the bone marrow, and decreasing T-regulatory
tumor-infiltrating cells have been reviewed.33 The Immunotherapy for Prostate AdenoCarcinoma Treatment
(IMPACT) study demonstrated that sipuleucel-T
extended median survival by 4.1 months and improved 3year survival by 38% compared with placebo34 when
administered to men with castration-recurrent CaP. If
immunomodulation produces a survival benefit in
patients with advanced disease, immunomodulation (or
the native immune response) may be more beneficial
when minimal CaP remains after failed local therapy.
Cure for metastatic CaP has been described rarely,
but an examination of survival plots always reveals
2631

Review Article

approximately 20% of men alive 4 years after ADT,
although numbers at risk are small and extended followup is reported rarely.35-38 A subgroup analysis suggested
that patients with minimal tumor burden had better
responses to complete androgen blockade than those
treated with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone
(LHRH) agonist alone.36 A secondary analysis of another
randomized trial of men with locally advanced or asymptomatic metastatic disease demonstrated that early intervention with ADT was more effective than deferred
intervention.39 ADT improves survival and may cure
some patients when applied in the adjuvant setting after
definitive local therapy, especially when it is initiated
when metastatic burden is low, such as in men who were
found to have pelvic lymph node metastases at the time of
radical prostatectomy.18,40 Approximately 47% of men
who received immediate and continuous ADT for lymph
node metastatic disease were alive without evidence of disease compared with 14% of men in the deferred ADT
arm. These results differ from population-based studies
that demonstrated no benefit to early ADT41 and are confounded by high rates of biochemical progression-free survival after operation alone.42 A phase 3 trial of continuous
versus intermittent ADT among men with PSA levels
>3 ng=mL after failure of primary or salvage radiotherapy43 produced similar disease-specific and overall survival rates and both arms demonstrated surprisingly low
levels of CaP-specific mortality. After failed radical prostatectomy, a case series reported that all 52 men who underwent induction ADT achieved an undetectable serum
PSA level (< 0.1 ng=mL) and that response continued in
9 men after a median follow-up of 62 months (range,
20 1-87 1 months).44 These men who may be cured had
usually experienced biochemical disease recurrence only
after failed local therapy (5 patients) or had clinically
localized CaP (3 patients). These findings have led some
clinicians to suggest that more complete ADT for patients
with CaP should be initiated at the earliest time, when
CaP tumor burden is smallest.45-47
Evidence That More Complete ADT Is Safe and
Perhaps Efficacious

Androgen annihilation (Fig. 3) could include the simultaneous use of 1) an LHRH agonist (leuprolide or goserelin) or antagonist (degarelix); 2) an older large
(bicalutamide or flutamide) or newer small (enzalutamide or ARN-509) antiandrogen; 3) a nonspecific
CYP17A1 inhibitor (ketoconazole) or a newer, more specific CYP17A1 inhibitor (abiraterone, orteronel
[TAK-700], or galeterone [Tok-100]); and 4) a SRD5A
2632

inhibitor that inhibits SRD5A type 2 (SRD5A2) (finasteride) or SRD5A types 1 and 2 (SRD5A1,2) (dutasteride). Previous trials have demonstrated the safety and
sometimes efficacy of drugs proposed for androgen annihilation when used alone or in combinations of up to 3
drugs.44-46,48-51 Tissue levels of testicular androgens and
androgen-regulated gene expression persisted when an
LHRH agonist, bicalutamide, dutasteride, and ketoconazole were administered for 3 months before radical prostatectomy was performed.52 Tumors were intermediate
to high risk and most likely bulky but, of 35 men, 2 had
no residual cancer and 9 had a tumor volume of < 0.2
cm3. More complete ADT may remain noncurative, clonally simplify the tumor, and hasten tumor growth and
progression.53,54 Well-designed clinical trials are essential
because a member of each of the 4 drug classes has not
been used together in men with CaP.
LHRH agonist versus antagonist

LHRH antagonists (abarelix and degarelix) are chemically
modified LHRHs, and hence pure antagonist peptides,
that have pharmacological activity against CaP.55 A phase
2 study revealed that abarelix given as monotherapy did
not induce an initial surge of testosterone, DHT, luteinizing hormone, or follicle-stimulating hormone and that
castration was nearly immediate after the initial dose.55,56
A multicenter phase 3 trial compared the efficacy of
LHRH agonist and antiandrogen against abarelix alone in
patients with advanced CaP.57 Abarelix achieved a castrate
serum level of testosterone more rapidly than
combination therapy and avoided the testosterone surge
characteristic of agonist therapy, but the 2 treatments similarly reduced serum PSA, and achieved and maintained
castrate levels of testosterone.
Antiandrogen

Bicalutamide and flutamide are “older” antiandrogens
that are used with LHRH agonists in the first 7 to 10 days
of treatment to prevent androgen flare in men with skeletal metastases in weight-bearing bones or symptoms.
However, their use as a single agent has been shown to be
effective in the treatment of advanced CaP.45,58 Nevertheless, there is a sense in the urological community, not
founded in clinical trials, that flutamide alone is not sufficient for ADT because it causes a reflex increase in luteinizing hormone and testosterone levels. Furthermore, in
vitro data have suggested that flutamide, at high concentrations, can interact with the androgen receptor.59
Finally, bicalutamide, even at a dose of 150 mg daily,
Cancer

produced no improvement in overall survival compared
with placebo.60
Enzalutamide is a second-generation antiandrogen
that demonstrated selective, potent affinity for androgen
receptor and lacked agonist androgen receptor activity in
castration-recurrent CaP models.61 Compared with bicalutamide, enzalutmide has a greater binding affinity to
androgen receptor. Enzalutamide was found to extend
survival by 5 months compared with placebo in patients
with castration-recurrent CaP who were treated previously with docetaxel.62 ARN-509 is an even newer antiandrogen,63 about which less has been reported.
SRD5A inhibitor

SRD5A2 is the dominant SRD5A isozyme in benign
prostate tissue and SRD5A1 may be upregulated in
patients with CaP; inhibition of both isozymes may be
more effective for CaP treatment or prevention. Dutasteride, a dual SRD5A inhibitor, has been shown to decrease
serum DHT to a greater extent than finasteride, a
SRD5A2 inhibitor (94.7% vs 70.8%).64 Treatment with
dutasteride for 6 to 10 weeks before prostatectomy
resulted in almost complete suppression of intraprostatic
DHT, increased apoptosis, and decreased microvessel
density. A phase 2 study of dutasteride for castrationrecurrent CaP treated a total of 25 men with asymptomatic castration-recurrent CaP with 3.5 mg of dutasteride
daily for 2 to 9 months.65 Dutasteride was safe but rarely
produced even biochemical responses in men with
castration-recurrent CaP.
LHRH agonist and antiandrogen

Combined androgen blockade (CAB) was reported initially to provide a substantial survival benefit in patients
with metastatic CaP compared with either LHRH agonist
or orchiectomy alone.36,39,66 Most clinicians now accept
that CAB appears to be well tolerated but neither delays
the time to disease progression nor increases the duration
of survival in patients with metastatic CaP. In what to my
knowledge is the largest and best-designed trial to date,
1387 patients were randomized to orchiectomy with or
without flutamide and demonstrated no survival benefit
for CAB.37 Southwest Oncology Group Grade 2 or higher
diarrhea and anemia were more frequent in the flutamide
group than the placebo group (P 5 .002 and P 5 .024,
respectively), although the incidence of toxicity associated
with both treatments was low. When 603 patients with
metastatic CaP were randomized to receive leuprolide plus
placebo or flutamide, moderate diarrhea occurred more
often in the group treated with flutamide (P < .001),
Cancer

although tolerability was similar in both groups.36 When
373 patients with locally advanced or metastatic CaP were
randomized to goserelin or goserelin and flutamide, time
to relief of bone pain was shorter in the CAB group,
whereas the incidence of diarrhea and increased blood
transaminases was higher in the CAB group.67
Antiandrogen and SRD5A inhibitor

The combination of finasteride and flutamide in the treatment of patients with advanced CaP demonstrated effectiveness and minimal side effects.45 Twenty-two men with
locally advanced (6 patients) or lymph node metastatic (16
patients) CaP were treated with finasteride and flutamide
and 21 responded with a decrease in PSA from a mean of
42.9 ng=mL to 3.6 ng=mL after 3 months and 3.1 ng=mL
after 24 months. Sexual function was maintained in 86%
of patients, liver and renal function remained normal in all
patients, 33% of patients experienced diarrhea, and 19%
of patients developed gynecomastia; no patient discontinued treatment due to side effects.
LHRH agonist and antiandrogen and SRD5A
inhibitor

Three agent androgen blockade (LHRH agonist plus antiandrogen plus finasteride) was administered to 110
patients with clinical T1 to T3 CaP for a median of 13
months followed by finasteride maintenance therapy.49
All patients achieved undetectable PSA levels (< 0.1
ng=mL), only 9 patients (8%) had a PSA level > 4.0
ng=mL after a median follow-up of 3 years, all patients
recovered normal testosterone levels, no patients required
the reinstitution of treatment, and toxicity was minimal.
A search of the PubMed database revealed no reported
updates of this experience.
CYP17A1 inhibitors

Recognition of the importance of weak adrenal androgens
as substrates for intracrine synthesis of testicular androgens was first tested using adrenalectomy among patients
with recurrent CaP after castration by Huggins and
Scott,68 then demonstrated by Geller et al,69 confirmed
by our group9 and then accepted by the field. Testicular
androgens can be produced by recurrent CaP from adrenal androgens10-12or cholesterol.13,14
CYP17A1 is an enzyme necessary for the intracrine
metabolism of testosterone from progesterone via the
“cholesterol pathway.” CYP17A1 also is necessary to produce DHT from SRD5A reduced progesterone metabolites through the “backdoor pathway” (Fig. 1).
Ketoconazole is a nonspecific weak inhibitor of
2633

Review Article

CYP17A1 that has antitumor properties but considerable side effects. Testicular extracts and radiolabeled
CYP17A1 steroid substrate identified abiraterone, a
potent, selective, irreversible inhibitor of CYP17A1.
Continuous CYP17A1 inhibition increases levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone, which can result in a syndrome of secondary mineralocorticoid excess. The
mineralocorticoid excess can be prevented by either a
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist or low-dose glucocorticoids. A phase 3 study demonstrated that the median overall survival in patients randomized to
abiraterone plus prednisone was 14.8 months versus
10.9 months in those randomized to placebo plus prednisone (P < .001).51 The study’s secondary endpoints
also favored the treatment group, and were all statistically significant, including time to PSA progression
(10.2 months vs 6.6 months), progression-free survival
(5.6 months vs 3.6 months), and PSA response rate
(29% vs 6%). Adverse events were observed more commonly in the group treated with abiraterone (comparing
treatment with placebo for all tumor grades) and
included fluid retention (31% vs 22%) and hypokalemia
(17% vs 8%). However, grade 3=4 hypokalemia (3.8%
vs 0.8%) and grade 3=4 hypertension (1.3% vs 0.3%)
were infrequent.
Orteronel and galeterone, produced by Millennium=Takeda (Osaka, Japan) and Tokai Pharmaceuticals (Cambridge, MA), respectively, currently are in
clinical trials and each has theoretical advantages that
may make them better drugs than abiraterone. Orteronel is a napththylmethylimidazole derivative that
selectively inhibits 17,20-lyse70 but may offer an
advantage over abiraterone because it is nonsteroidal
and may not require the coadministration of prednisone. Orteronel has been characterized thoroughly in
human cell lines and cynomolgus monkeys.71 Two
phase 3 evaluations of orteronel at a dose of 400 mg
twice daily are ongoing in men with metastatic
castration-recurrent CaP, and include the administration of concomitant prednisone; the postdocetaxel
trial appears not to have met the primary endpoint.72
3-beta-hydroxy-17-(1H-benzimidazole-1-yl) androsta5, or 16-diene (galeterone), is another CYP17 inhibitor that has demonstrated antiandrogenic activity and
is in preclinical development. Galeterone was found
to be more potent than castration in a xenograft
model.73 A unique feature of this compound is the
ability to reduce androgen receptor protein levels, in
contrast to bicalutamide or castration, which increased
androgen receptor protein expression.74 Administering
2634

abiraterone and its relatives earlier in the course of
ADT may produce responses of greater magnitude
and duration and further the goal of turning CaP that
recurs after failed curative therapy into a chronic
disease.
Challenges

At each step in the processes of uptake, reservoir, reduction, degradation, and excretion of testosterone and
DHT, genetic polymorphisms in critical enzymes and
proteins may result in substantial interindividual variation
that may affect the response to ADT or androgen annihilation. In addition, genetic polymorphisms may affect the
pharmacokinetics of the different ADT agents that result
in a variation of effect that impacts the response of
patients with CaP. The causes of interpatient variability in
the extent and duration of response to ADT remain
unknown, but could result in part from the variation in
the level of androgen receptor activity observed among
patients with CaP,75,76 polymorphisms in transporters
that have been correlated with the duration of response to
ADT,77,78 polymorphisms in SRD5A2 that have been
associated with the risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia
and CaP,79 and responses to SRD5A inhibitors that
appear to be cell line-specific80 (and most likely patientspecific).81 Finally, patients with recurrent CaP after radical prostatectomy and=or radiotherapy may experience
bowel and urinary symptoms and sexual dysfunction.82,83
ADT may cause decreased energy, fatigue, depression,
and hot flashes.84-86 The effect of androgen annihilation
on health-related quality of life is unknown, and may be
more prevalent and=or severe than that reported for
standard ADT. If androgen annihilation improves the duration of PSA response, the impact on health-related quality of life must be delineated to inform patient decisionmaking.
