Activation of Protease-Activated Receptor-1

Abstract
Metastatic breast cancer shows extreme tropism for the bone
microenvironment, leading to the establishment of osteolytic
metastases. Perpetuation of tumor-induced osteolysis requires
a continuous supply of osteoclast precursors migrating into
the bone microenvironment that can subsequently differentiate into mature osteoclasts and resorb bone. Thus, identification and subsequent targeting of chemoattractants of
osteoclast precursors that are up-regulated at the tumor-bone
interface represents a potential avenue to interrupt osteolysis.
We report that cathepsin G, a serine protease, plays a vital
role in the bone microenvironment by modulating tumorstromal interaction in a manner that favors tumor establishment and regulates chemotaxis of monocytes, a subset of
which has the potential to differentiate into osteoclasts. Our
data show that cathepsin G–induced chemotaxis of monocytes
is mediated by proteolytic activation of protease-activated
receptor-1 (PAR-1). Attenuation of PAR-1 activation abrogates
cathepsin G–mediated induction of monocyte chemotaxis.
We also show that in vivo inhibition of cathepsin G reduces
the number of CD11b+ osteoclast precursors and mature osteoclasts at the tumor-bone interface. Together, these data suggest that therapeutic targeting of both PAR-1 signaling in
osteoclast precursors as well as cathepsin G at the tumor-bone
interface has the potential to reduce osteolysis by inhibiting
the recruitment, differentiation, and activation of osteoclast
precursors. [Cancer Res 2009;69(7):3188–95]

Introduction
Nearly 200,000 women in the United States are diagnosed with
breast cancer annually and over 40,000 women every year
ultimately succumb to breast cancer (1). Of those that succumb
to their disease, nearly all are found to have bone metastases that
are predominantly osteolytic in nature (2). These osteolytic lesions
carry significant consequences, including hypercalcemia, increased
risk of pathologic fracture, and intractable bone pain (2), which
both dramatically decrease the quality of life and increase mortality
for breast cancer patients. Thus, understanding the complex
dialogue that occurs between tumor cells and cells of the bone
microenvironment that distort normal bone physiology in a way
that favors osteolysis becomes important for designing new
therapeutic strategies to combat this serious health problem.

As malignant tumor cells enter the bone microenvironment,
they release signaling molecules that initiate a vicious cycle that
promotes both tumor cell growth and osteolysis (2, 3). The ratelimiting step of this cycle is the signaling that occurs between
osteoblasts and osteoclasts because this requires cell to cell contact
to bring receptor activator of nuclear factor-nB (RANK) ligand
(RANKL) on the surface of osteoblasts and RANK on the surface
of osteoclast precursors into contact. Our recent data show that
this requirement can be bypassed via cleavage of RANKL from the
cell surface of osteoblasts by cathepsin G, generating soluble
RANKL (sRANKL) that relieves the necessity of cell-cell contact
and allows widespread osteoclast activation and enhanced osteolysis (4). Cathepsin G expression is up-regulated at the tumor-bone
interface of mammary tumor–induced osteolytic lesions (4).
However, even with the increased generation of sRANKL, there
must be continuous recruitment of osteoclast precursors that can
become activated for osteolysis to continue to occur. Identification
of a chemoattractant that is up-regulated at the tumor-bone
interface that is responsible for recruiting osteoclast precursors
would represent a point in the cycle that could potentially be disrupted with therapeutic targeting. Cathepsin G has previously been
shown to be a chemoattractant for monocytes, and a subset of
monocytes serves as osteoclast precursors (5). Thus, up-regulation
of cathepsin G at the tumor-bone interface is potentially important
in perpetuating osteolysis via recruitment of monocytes. Consequently, in this report, we sought to confirm that cathepsin G is
a chemoattractant for osteoclast precursors and then sought to
delineate the signaling pathway used by cathepsin G in the chemoattraction of osteoclast precursors.
One receptor family that has been previously implicated in
protease-induced chemoattraction is the protease-activated receptors (PAR). These G protein–coupled receptors (GPCR) are
activated when the NH2 terminus is cleaved by proteases
generating a tethered ligand that can bind intramolecularly and
initiate signaling (6). The mammalian genome encodes four
members of the PAR family (6). This family of receptors is involved
both directly and indirectly in the chemotaxis of a variety of cell
types. Direct activation of the PARs has been shown to affect the
migration of eosinophils (7), monocytes (8), and breast cancer cells
(9–12). The PAR family of receptors has also been shown to
indirectly influence the migration of prostate cancer cells and
monocytes through increased production of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1; refs. 13, 14). Here, we report that
cathepsin G–mediated recruitment of osteoclast precursors
requires proteolytic activation of PAR-1, which potentially
increases osteolysis by indirectly increasing the number of
activated osteoclasts.

Cathepsin G and Osteoclast Recruitment

Figure 1. Cathepsin G is a
chemoattractant for monocytes via a
proteolytic mechanism. A, cathepsin G
showed a concentration-dependent
induction of monocyte chemotaxis.
At the highest concentrations, it induced
chemotaxis similar to MCP-1, a known
monocyte chemoattractant. Bars, SD.
***, significantly different from cells

B, representative fields from HBSS alone,
MCP-1 (10 ng/mL), and cathepsin G

inhibitor of the proteolytic activity of
cathepsin G, effectively eliminated

monocytes. Bars, SD. ***, significantly

Fico/Lite-Monocytes (Atlanta Biologicals) per standard procedures. The
blood samples were obtained using protocols approved by the Institutional
Review Board of the University of Nebraska Medical Center. A chemotaxis
assay was set up using a three-tiered chemotaxis chamber (Neuro Probe)
and the following chemoattractants: HBSS alone (negative control); 10 and
100 ng/mL of MCP-1 (positive control); and 100 ng/mL, 1 Ag/mL, 5 Ag/mL,
and 10 Ag/mL of cathepsin G. Each chemoattractant was plated in
triplicate. For each well, ten 250-Am fields were counted.
N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone inhibition chemotaxis
assay. To test whether the proteolytic activity of cathepsin G is necessary
for its ability to serve as a chemoattractant, the chemotaxis assay was
repeated using HBSS, 1 Ag/mL cathepsin G, and 1 Ag/mL cathepsin G
preincubated with 1 mmol/L N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone
(TPCK; Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at 37jC. TPCK is an inhibitor of the
chymotrypsin-like group of proteases and is a potent inhibitor of cathepsin
G (4, 15, 16). TPCK has also previously been shown to be nontoxic to
osteoclast precursors/osteoclasts (4).
PAR expression in monocytes. Human PBMCs were isolated as
described. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Total
RNA (5 Ag) was used for reverse transcription. First-strand cDNA was

www.aacrjournals.org

generated using oligo(dT)18 (Fermentas) and SuperScript II RT (Invitrogen).
The resulting cDNA (2 AL; 1:10 dilution) was used in the reactions with
gene-specific primers. The following gene-specific primers were used: PAR1 , 5¶-GTGATTGGCAGTTTGGGTCT-3¶ and 5¶-GCCAGACAAGTGAAGGAAGC-3¶; PAR-2, 5¶-TGCTAGCAGCCTCTCTCTCC-3¶ and 5¶-CCAGTGAGGACAGATGCAGA-3¶; PAR-3, 5¶-GGCACAGGAGAGCAAACTTC-3¶ and 5¶CTGCAAAGATGAGGGCTTTC-3¶; PAR-4, 5¶-CAGACTTCCTGGAGGAGTGG3¶ and 5¶-GTTGTTGTTGAGCTCGTTGG-4¶; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase , 5¶-AGCCTCGTCCCGTAGACAAAA-3¶ and 5¶-GATGACAAGCTTCCCATCTCG-3¶. PCRs were carried out using a PTC-100
Programmable Thermal Controller (MJ Research) under optimal conditions.
PCR fragments were separated on 2% ethidium bromide containing agarose
gel and analyzed using a MultiImage Light Cabinet (Alpha Innotech Corp.).
PAR activation chemotaxis assay. To determine if PAR-1 activation
leads to chemotaxis of monocytes, the chemotaxis assay was repeated
using HBSS alone (negative control), 10 and 100 ng/mL of MCP-1 (positive
control), 1 and 5 Ag/mL of cathepsin G, and 1 and 5 Ag/mL of PAR-1
agonist (AnaSpec). Because PBMCs do not express PAR-2, PAR-2 agonist
(AnaSpec) was also used as a negative control at concentrations of 1 and
5 Ag/mL.

Figure 2. PAR-1 activation results in induction of monocyte chemotaxis. A, human monocytes expressed PAR-1 and PAR-3 at the mRNA level but not PAR-2 or
PAR-4. GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. B, PAR-1 peptide agonist induced chemotaxis of monocytes but less than cathepsin G at similar
concentrations. PAR-2 peptide agonist had no effect on monocyte chemotaxis because monocytes do not express PAR-2. Bars, SD. ***, significantly different from cells
incubated with medium alone by post hoc analysis using Bonferroni’s correction.

PAR-1 inhibition chemotaxis assay. To evaluate the role of PAR-1 in
cathepsin G–mediated chemoattraction, the chemotaxis assay was repeated
using HBSS (negative control), 5 Ag/mL cathepsin G, 5 Ag/mL cathepsin G
plus blocking anti–PAR-1 antibody, and 5 Ag/mL cathepsin G plus
nonblocking anti–PAR-1 antibody. The blocking antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) and the nonblocking antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
were both used at a final dilution of 1:200 (17).
Pertussis toxin/cholera toxin inhibition chemotaxis assay. To
determine what subunits of the GPCR are activated during cathepsin
G–mediated chemotaxis, the chemotaxis assay was repeated using HBSS,
5 Ag/mL cathepsin G, and 5 Ag/mL PAR-1 agonist using monocytes that
had been preincubated with 100 ng/mL pertussis toxin (PTX; SigmaAldrich) for 2 h at 37jC, monocytes that had been preincubated with
10 Ag/mL cholera toxin (CTX) for 2 h at 37jC, or monocytes not pretreated.
Conditioned medium treatment of RAW 264.7 and Cl66 cells. RAW
264.7, a murine monocyte/macrophage cell line, and Cl66 mammary tumor
cells were seeded onto 100-mm dishes at a density of 1  106 per dish. Cells
were grown in DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% vitamins, 1%
L-glutamine, and 0.08% gentamicin (DMEM complete medium). The cells

were incubated overnight. The following day, the concentration of FBS was
reduced to 1%. The cells were then allowed to grow for 48 h, at which time
conditioned medium was collected for each of the cell lines.
RAW 264.7 cells were then seeded onto six-well plates at a density
of 5,000/cm2. The cells were then grown in DMEM complete medium plus
10%, 25%, or 50% Cl66-conditioned medium. Simultaneously, Cl66 cells
were seeded onto six-well plates at a density of 5,000/cm2. The cells were
then grown in DMEM complete medium plus 10%, 25%, or 50% conditioned
medium from RAW 264.7 cells. At the end of 4 d, total RNA was isolated as
previously described and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was done
for cathepsin G using gene-specific primers.
In vivo inhibition of cathepsin G using TPCK. Cathepsin G function
was inhibited using TPCK in a murine bone invasion model as previously
described (4). Cl66 tumor cells (1  105) mixed with growth factor–reduced
Matrigel were implanted on the dorsal skin flap over the calvaria of female
BALB/c mice. Tumor growth was monitored twice a week. Beginning 7 d
after tumor implantation, mice were injected s.c. with TPCK at 50 mg/kg/d
(n = 4) or 50 AL DMSO (n = 4) for 21 d. Mice were sacrificed at day 31 after
implantation and necropsied for examination of osteolytic lesions.
All studies were done in accordance with the Institutional Animal Use
and Care Committee of the University of Nebraska Medical Center.
Immunohistochemistry for CD11b. CD11b is a marker for osteoclast
precursors (18–25). Sections from TPCK-treated animals or control (DMSO)–
treated animals were rehydrated and endogenous peroxidase activity
was quenched. Antigen retrieval was then performed by boiling sections in
10 mmol/L sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 11 min. Sections were blocked
using goat serum. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4jC with
antibody directed against CD11b (Caltag Laboratories) diluted 1:20 in
blocking solution. After washing, sections were incubated for 1 h at room
temperature with biotinylated anti-rat IgG diluted 1:200. After washing again,
sections were incubated with avidin-biotin complex (Vectastain ABC, Vector
Laboratories) for 45 min at room temperature. Sections were then washed
and developed using 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine (Vector Laboratories) substrate.
The sections were then counterstained with hematoxylin. Species-specific IgG
isotype was added in lieu of primary antibody as a negative control, and these
sections showed no detectable staining. For each section, f8,000 cells were
counted. The CD11b staining index was calculated by dividing the number of
labeled cells by the total number of cells and multiplying by 100. The CD11b
staining index was calculated for each section.
Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining. Sections from TPCKtreated animals or control (DMSO)–treated animals were rehydrated using

from 100 ng/mL to 10 Ag/mL (Fig. 1A and B). Even in response
to as little as 100 ng/mL cathepsin G, induction of chemotaxis
was statistically significant compared with control. The highest
concentration used, 10 Ag/mL, induced chemotaxis at a level
similar to 100 ng/mL MCP-1 (Fig. 1A and B).
Cathepsin G–induced chemotaxis of monocytes occurs via a
proteolytic mechanism. Next, we used TPCK, an inhibitor of the

a series of xylenes and ethanols. Then, the slides were incubated in tartrateresistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining solution (Sigma-Aldrich) at
37jC for 2 h. After washing with deionized water for 10 min, counterstaining was done with Gill Hematoxylin 3 solution for 2 min. Slides were
washed with running tap water for 10 min and then mounted with aqueous
mount. The total number of TRAP-positive, multinucleated osteoclasts over
the entire length of the tumor-bone interface was then counted for each
section using a light microscope. The total number of osteoclasts was then
divided by the length of the tumor-bone interface to get the number of
osteoclasts per millimeter of tumor-bone interface.
Statistical analysis. ANOVA was performed for statistical comparison of
multiple groups. P < 0.05 was considered significant. If significance was
found in the ANOVA, then post hoc analysis was performed to compare
specific groups using Bonferroni’s correction, where the significance level
was determined by dividing 0.05 by the number of comparisons to be made.
Where only two groups were tested, the Student’s t test was used. P < 0.05
was considered significant.

Results
Cathepsin G is a chemoattractant for monocytes. MCP-1 is
known to induce monocyte chemoattraction. It was used in a
monocyte chemotaxis assay as a positive control, whereas HBSS
alone was used as a negative control. Cathepsin G showed a
concentration-dependent induction of monocyte chemotaxis

significant inhibition of cathepsin G–induced chemotaxis of monocytes following TPCK treatment (Fig. 1C). These data show that
induction of chemotaxis of monocytes by cathepsin G occurs via a
proteolytic mechanism.
Monocytes express PAR-1 and PAR-3. PCR was used to examine the expression of the PARs by monocytes. Monocytes express
both PAR-1 and PAR-3 but do not express PAR-2 or PAR-4 at
the mRNA level (Fig. 2A). PAR-1 was expressed at a higher level
than PAR-3.
PAR-1 activation induces chemotaxis of monocytes. To
determine if PAR-1 activation is potentially involved in cathepsin
G–induced chemotaxis of monocytes, a PAR-1 peptide agonist
was used to evaluate chemotaxis. A PAR-2 peptide agonist was
also used as a negative control because monocytes do not express

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (7). April 1, 2009

PAR-2. As expected, the PAR-2 agonist did not induce chemotaxis
of monocytes and did not differ from HBSS alone (Fig. 2B). The
PAR-1 agonist did induce chemotaxis of monocytes at a level that
was statistically significant compared with control but did not
induce the same level of chemotaxis as cathepsin G at similar
concentrations (Fig. 2B).
Cathepsin G induces chemotaxis of monocytes via proteolytic cleavage of PAR-1. To attempt to show that the mechanism
by which cathepsin G induces chemotaxis of monocytes is via
proteolytic cleavage of PAR-1, blocking antibody to PAR-1 was
used. Blocking antibody to PAR-1 significantly reduced cathepsin
G–mediated chemotaxis, although it did not eliminate it (Fig. 3).
A nonblocking antibody to PAR-1 had no effect on the ability of
cathepsin G to induce chemotaxis of monocytes (Fig. 3), confirming

that proteolytic cleavage of PAR-1 mediates cathepsin G–induced
chemotaxis of monocytes.
Cathepsin G–mediated activation of PAR-1 results in
signaling via GAi/o. The PARs are GPCRs that are known to signal
through a variety of pathways (26, 27). PTX is a known inhibitor of
the Gai/o subunits of GPCRs, whereas CTX is a known inhibitor of
the Gas subunit of GPCRs (28). PTX eliminated the ability of the
PAR-1 agonist to induce chemotaxis, whereas CTX had no effect,
suggesting that PAR-1 is inducing chemotaxis via the Gai/o subunits (Fig. 4). Similarly, PTX reduced cathepsin G–induced
chemotaxis, whereas CTX had no effect, suggesting that cathepsin
G–induced chemotaxis occurs, at least partially, through a Gai/o
subunit–mediated mechanism (Fig. 4).
Interaction of mammary tumor cells with osteoclast
precursors regulates cathepsin G expression. To determine
which cells up-regulate the expression of cathepsin G during the
migration of breast tumor cells into the bone microenvironment,
we examined whether conditioned medium from Cl66 cells modulates cathepsin G expression by osteoclast precursors and vice
versa. First, cathepsin G baseline mRNA expression was examined
in human PBMCs and RAW 264.7 cells, a murine monocyte/
macrophage cell line, as well as in the mammary tumor cell lines
4T1, Cl66, and Cl66M2. All cell lines expressed cathepsin G at the
mRNA level (Fig. 5A). Cl66 cells increased expression of cathepsin
G when treated with RAW 264.7–conditioned medium (Fig. 5B).
Similarly, RAW 264.7 cells increased cathepsin G expression
when treated with Cl66-conditioned medium (Fig. 5C). Although
Cl66 cells showed more marked up-regulation of cathepsin G
expression, the baseline expression was higher in RAW 264.7 cells
(Fig. 5D). Thus, RAW 264.7 cells treated with Cl66-conditioned
medium showed higher overall expression of cathepsin G than Cl66
cells treated with RAW 264.7–conditioned medium.
Inhibition of cathepsin G in vivo reduces osteoclast
precursors at the tumor-bone interface. We used CD11b as a
marker for osteoclast precursors (18–25). We stained sections from
the tumor-bone interface of mice bearing Cl66 tumors treated with
either control treatment (DMSO) or TPCK, a cathepsin G inhibitor.
There were significantly less CD11b+ osteoclast precursors at the
tumor-bone interface of TPCK-treated animals (Fig. 6A and B).
Inhibition of cathepsin G in vivo reduces osteoclasts at the
tumor-bone interface. TRAP staining was used to identify mature,
multinucleated osteoclasts at the tumor-bone interface. We stained
sections from Cl66 tumor-bearing mice that were treated with
either control treatment (DMSO) or TPCK. Treatment with TPCK
significantly reduced the number of osteoclasts at the tumor-bone
interface (Fig. 6C and D).

Discussion
As mammary tumor cells enter the bone microenvironment,
they secrete soluble factors that initiate a vicious cycle leading to
both tumor growth and osteolysis (2). Continuation of the vicious
cycle depends on a continuous supply of osteoclast precursors that
can be activated by RANKL. Without this influx of osteoclast
precursors to the site of metastasis, the cycle would be disrupted.
A subset of the hematopoietic lineage of monocytes/macrophages
serves as osteoclast precursors. To date, the chemoattractant
responsible for ensuring this continuous supply of osteoclast
precursors remains unclear.
Cathepsin G plays an important role in amplifying the vicious
cycle by shedding the extracellular domain of RANKL, which

www.aacrjournals.org

enhances RANKL-mediated osteoclast activation (4). In this study,
we have identified an additional role for cathepsin G in the
induction of chemotaxis of osteoclast precursors to the site of
metastasis. We hypothesized that as tumor cells enter the bone
microenvironment, a cycle thus ensues whereby osteoclasts produce increased cathepsin G as they interact with tumor cells, which
recruits additional osteoclast precursors that can differentiate
and produce more cathepsin G, leading to further recruitment
of osteoclast precursors. The amplification of cathepsin G production and continuous recruitment of osteoclast precursors ensures
perpetuation of the cycle.
Induction of chemotaxis of monocytes is dependent on the
proteolytic activity of cathepsin G. One family of receptors
that requires proteolytic cleavage to be activated and that has
previously been shown to play a role in chemotaxis is the PARs.
We found that monocytes express both PAR-1 and PAR-3. Because PAR-1 is extensively involved in chemotaxis (7, 12, 14) and
it was expressed at the highest level by monocytes, we first
examined whether cathepsin G–induced chemotaxis occurs via
PAR-1 activation.
Activation of PAR-1 by a small peptide, PAR-1 agonist, induced
chemotaxis of monocytes but to a lesser extent than similar
concentrations of cathepsin G. Because monocytes do not express
PAR-2, we used a small peptide, PAR-2 agonist, as a negative
control. To link cathepsin G–mediated induction of chemotaxis to
PAR-1 activation, we used two different anti–PAR-1 antibodies: a
blocking antibody that prevents proteolytic activation and a
nonblocking antibody that recognizes PAR-1 but does not prevent
proteolytic activation. The blocking antibody significantly reduced
induction of chemotaxis. Conversely, the nonblocking antibody
had no effect. Taken together, these results confirm that cathepsin
G–mediated induction of chemotaxis is partially mediated by
proteolytic activation of PAR-1.
PAR-1 is a GPCR that initiates signaling through several different
pathways. Because PAR-1 mediates numerous effects through a
myriad of signaling pathways, we sought to determine if Gas and/
or Gai/o are involved in cathepsin G–mediated induction of
chemotaxis. PTX constitutively activates Gai/o subunits, which
prevents further activation, whereas CTX constitutively activates
the Gas subunit, preventing further activation (28). Monocytes
pretreated with CTX did not show reduced chemoattraction in
response to cathepsin G. PTX significantly reduced cathepsin
G–mediated induction of chemotaxis, which shows the involvement of the Gai/o subunits.
We have previously reported that cathepsin G is up-regulated at
the tumor-bone interface of mammary tumor–induced osteolytic
lesions (4). To evaluate the source of cathepsin G in the bone
microenvironment, we looked at expression in 4T1, Cl66, and
Cl66M2 (murine breast cancer cell lines), RAW 264.7 cells (murine
monocyte/macrophage cell line), and human PBMCs. All cell
lines tested expressed cathepsin G at the mRNA level. We observed
up-regulation of cathepsin G in both RAW 264.7 cells treated
with Cl66-conditioned medium and Cl66 cells treated with RAW
264.7–conditioned medium, suggesting that both osteoclasts and
tumor cells likely contribute to the observed up-regulation of
cathepsin G at the tumor-bone interface. Although the most
significant up-regulation was observed in the Cl66 cells treated
with RAW 264.7–conditioned medium, the baseline expression

with RAW 264.7–conditioned medium. Hence, although both
Cl66 cells and osteoclasts up-regulate cathepsin G expression as
tumor cells interact with the bone microenvironment, osteoclasts
likely make the most significant contribution. This agrees with our
previously reported immunohistochemistry data that showed
moderate positivity for cathepsin G in Cl66 cells at the tumorbone interface and strong positivity for cathepsin G in osteoclasts (4).
Serine proteases such as cathepsin G are stored in azurophilic
granules of neutrophils, and the major physiologic function of
these proteinases is commonly thought to be the intralysosomal
degradation of engulfed debris or microorganisms. However, it has
become evident that cathepsin G plays a crucial role in extracellular proteolytic processes at sites of inflammation (4, 29–36).
Our immunohistochemical analysis shows diffused cytoplasmic
cathepsin G expression in osteoclasts and malignant cells at the
tumor-bone interface (4). In our in vitro coculture experiments,
we observed cathepsin G activity in cell-free supernatant (data not
shown). A previous report has shown that cathepsin G is found
in gingival tissue during periodontal disease (37). Furthermore,
activation of neutrophils with inflammatory cytokines induced
release of cathepsin G into the extracellular space and increased
the membrane-bound form of catalytically active cathepsin G
(5, 32, 34–37).
These data, taken as a whole, suggested that inhibition of
cathepsin G in vivo would potentially reduce the number of
osteoclast precursors at the tumor-bone interface, which would
have the potential to reduce osteolysis. We have previously
reported that inhibition of cathepsin G in vivo does, in fact,
significantly reduce the bone destruction index (4). Here, we show
that one potential mechanism for the observed reduction in the
bone destruction index, in addition to the reduction in sRANKL
that we previously reported (4), is a reduction in the number of
osteoclast precursors at the tumor-bone interface. We used CD11b
as a marker for osteoclast precursors (18–25) and observed
significantly fewer CD11b+ osteoclast precursors in TPCK-treated
animals, suggesting that cathepsin G is responsible for the
recruitment of osteoclast precursors to the site of mammary
tumor–induced osteolysis.
The question remaining to be answered was whether reduction of CD11b+ cells at the tumor-bone interface would translate
into a reduction in the number of mature osteoclasts. We did

observe significantly fewer mature osteoclasts at the tumor-bone
interface of TPCK-treated animals. This suggests that inhibition
of cathepsin G does, in fact, reduce the number of osteoclast
precursors migrating to the tumor-bone interface, which in turn
depletes the pool of osteoclast precursors and reduces the number
of osteoclasts.
Little is known about cathepsin G in the physiologic bone
microenvironment. In fact, cathepsin G knockout mice have no
morphologic defects in bone development (38), suggesting that
cathepsin G may be an ideal target in mammary tumor–induced
bone lesions as side effects would likely be minimal. Furthermore,
despite apparently normal bone development in cathepsin G
knockout mice and no known physiologic roles for cathepsin
G in the bone microenvironment, other pathophysiologic roles in
the bone microenvironment have been established, including
periodontitis (39), rheumatoid arthritis (40), and tumor-induced
osteolysis (4).
In conclusion, we report that cathepsin G serves as a chemoattractant for osteoclast precursors via proteolytic activation of
PAR-1. The up-regulation of cathepsin G at the tumor-bone interface of mammary tumor–induced osteolytic lesions thus serves to
increase osteoclast differentiation via the generation of sRANKL
(4) as well as by ensuring there is a continuous supply of osteoclast precursors that can be differentiated by the newly generated
sRANKL. Other factors, including interleukin-8, are also likely
involved. However, for the first time, we report the involvement
of cathepsin G and have delineated portions of its downstream
signaling pathway.
