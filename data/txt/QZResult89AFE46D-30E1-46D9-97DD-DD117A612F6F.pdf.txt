Abstract
Drugs that target the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor
(IGF-IR) and/or insulin receptor (IR) are currently under
investigation for a variety of malignancies including breast
cancer. Although we have previously reported that IGF-IR
expression in primary breast tumors is common, the activation
status of this receptor has not been examined in relation to
survival. Phosphorylated IGF-IR/IR (P-IGF-IR/IR) and its
downstream signaling partner phospho-S6 (P-S6) were evaluated immunohistochemically in tumor tissue microarrays
representing 438 cases of invasive breast cancer. P-IGF-IR/IR
(n = 114; P = 0.046) and total levels of IR (n = 122; P = 0.009)
were indicative of poor survival, whereas total IGF-IR (n = 112;
P = 0.304) was not. P-IGF-IR/IR and P-S6 were coordinately
expressed in primary breast tumors (likelihood ratio, 11.57;
P = 6.70  10 4). Importantly, P-IGF-IR/IR was detected in all
breast cancer subtypes (luminal, 48.1%; triple negative, 41.9%;
and HER2, 64.3%). In vitro, the IGF-IR/IR inhibitor BMS-536924
decreased phospho-RSK and P-S6, and significantly suppressed
the growth of breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, SUM149, and
AU565 representing the luminal, triple negative, and HER2
subtypes, respectively, in monolayer and soft agar. BMS-536924
also inhibited growth in tamoxifen resistant MCF-7 Tam-R cells
while having little effect on immortalized normal breast
epithelial cells. Thus, we can determine which patients have
the activated receptor and provide evidence that P-IGF-IR/IR is
a prognostic factor for breast cancer. Beyond this, P-IGF-IR/IR
could be a predictive marker for response to IGF-IR and/or
IR-targeted therapies, as these inhibitors may be of benefit in
all breast cancer subtypes including those with acquired
resistance to tamoxifen. [Cancer Res 2008;68(24):10238–46]

expressed in a wide range of tumors including those that arise in
the breast. Several studies indicate that IGF-IR activation is
associated with the growth, invasion, and metastasis of breast
cancer (1) and where estrogen receptor (ER) is present, also
interplays with this steroid hormone receptor to promote growth
(2). The expression of constitutively active IGF-IR in the mammary
gland leads to the development of tumors (3) while overexpression
of a constitutively activated IGF-IR (CD8-IGF-IR) is sufficient to
cause transformation of immortalized human mammary epithelial
cells and growth in immunocompromised mice (4). Conversely,
silencing IGF-IR with small molecules inhibits the growth of
mammary cells (IGF-IR-Sal) expressing constitutively activated
IGF-IR in a xenograft model (3). As well, IGF-IR neutralizing
antibodies suppress the growth of breast cancer cells implanted as
xenografts (5). Furthermore, transgenic mice that express activated
IGF-IR in the mammary gland under a doxycycline inducible
promoter developed tumors at 2 months of age (6). Thus, IGF-IR
signaling is important for the development of breast tumors and
cancers continue to depend upon this pathway for sustained
growth and survival.
Given the importance of IGF-IR in tumor growth, it has become
an attractive molecular target for therapy and small molecules
as well as antibodies are being developed to inhibit this pathway
(7–10). Although most of them are directed against IGF-IR, some
also inhibit insulin receptors (IR), which could be additionally
beneficial given that IGF-IR and IR form heterodimers (11, 12) and
that the IR itself has been shown to be important in cancers (13).
For example, two recent dual specificity inhibitors, BMS-554417
and BMS-536924, were found to target both the IGF-IR and IR and
were active in vivo (4, 14, 15). Although these compounds can lead
to hyperglycemia, there is recent preclinical evidence that this
adverse effect can be attenuated by the use of metformin.5
The IGF-IR pathway is also implicated in resistance to targeted
therapies including those that target the ER and the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) family members EGFR and HER2.
For example, IGF-IR is reportedly up-regulated during the
acquisition of tamoxifen resistance. The continuous exposure of
MCF-7 cells to tamoxifen resulted in the eventual emergence of
resistant cells, called MCF-7 Tam-R, which use IGF-IR for their
growth (16, 17). Activation of the IGF-IR signaling cascade has
also been reported in models of resistance to agents that target

the EGFR family (16, 18–20). It is therefore rational to inhibit the
IGF-IR pathway to prevent or attenuate the development of
resistance (21) and to use IGF-IR inhibitors in circumstances where
acquired resistance has developed over time.
Understanding the clinical role of IGF-IR/IR signaling in
different subtypes of breast cancer is also very important in the
treatment of patients because each subtype has a clinically
distinct outcome and therefore requires a different treatment
protocol. ER-positive luminal breast cancers usually have better
outcomes compared with the aggressive ER-negative, HER2, and
triple-negative groups (22). Tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors are
generally the first line therapy for luminal patients, whereas
trastuzumab is prescribed for HER2 overexpressing breast cancer
patients. Unfortunately, there is currently no targeted treatment
for triple-negative breast cancers. These tumors do not express
ER, progesterone receptor (PR), nor do they overexpress HER2,
and 65–80% of patients usually die within two years of diagnosis
(23, 24). The relative importance of IGF-IR/IR signaling in
different types of breast cancer is still unclear.
Previously, we have shown that total IGF-IR expression in
breast cancer was evident in 87% of primary breast tumors by
screening a cohort of 930 patient samples (25). At that time, we
were unable to determine whether or not the receptor was
activated because suitable antibodies were not available, although
a subsequent small study indicated that activation of IGF-IR is
detectable in clinical disease (26). Given the growing interest in
IGF-IR as a target for cancer therapy (27), and the development of
several new drug candidates against IGF-IR (28), it is timely that
we now evaluate the role of activated IGF-IR/IR in the large series
of primary breast tumors in relation to patient survival as well as
the potential application of IGF-IR/IR inhibitors in key subtypes
of this disease.
In this study, we report that activated IGF-IR/IR is predicative of
poor outcomes for breast cancer patients after screening 438
primary tumor tissues. We further show that the downstream
protein phospho-S6 was correlated with P-IGF-IR/IR expression in
these clinical specimens. Using MCF-7 (as a model ER-positive
luminal breast cancer), SUM149 (as a model for ER-negative
triple-negative breast cancer), and AU565 (representing HER2
overexpressing breast cancer) cell lines, we also show that the small
molecule IGF-IR tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitor, BMS-536924 (10),
actively inhibited growth of all cell lines, including a tamoxifen
resistance MCF-7 subtype, in two-dimensional (collagen matrix)
and three-dimensional (soft agar) culture systems.

Materials and Methods
Clinical breast cancer tissue microarray construction. The tissue
microarray (TMA) was composed of duplicate cores from 438 primary
breast tumors. Construction of the TMA and the clinical correlates were
previously described by us (29–31).
Optimization of phospho-IGF-IR/IR staining. Previous studies by this
group (JG, HJ, RN) showed that IGF-IR is highly expressed and activated in
DU145 prostate cancer cells that had acquired resistance to gefitinib
(DU145/TKIR; ref. 16). This activity is reversible using IGF-IR TK inhibitors
such as AG1024 (16). To ensure specificity of staining obtained with the
phospho-IGF-IR (Tyr1131)/IR (Tyr1146; Cell Signaling Technologies #3021)
antibody to be used for the current clinical studies, we first evaluated this
antibody within the DU145/TKIR cells. These cells were maintained in
DCCM-1 medium containing 1 Amol/L gefitinib and plated at 7.5  103
cells/22 mm2 coverslip and grown to 60% confluence as previously
described (16). The DU145/TKIR cells were then treated with or without

20 Amol/L of the IGF-IR–selective TK inhibitor AG1024 for 24 h (16).
The cells were immunostained on coverslips for phosphorylated IGF-IR/IR
using the above antibody or evaluated by immunoblotting, as previously
described (16). P-IGF-IR/IR staining was detected as a crisp plasma
membrane signal in the DU145/TKIR cells while treating with 20 Amol/L
AG1024 depleted this staining (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Findings
were corroborated by an equivalent profile by Western blot analysis
with this antibody (Supplementary Fig. S1B ). Sections (5 Am) of
formalin-fixed/paraffin-embedded DU145/TKIR cell pellets were subsequently stained using this antibody as applied in the clinical assay
procedure (see below). Again, the DU145/TKIR cells stained at the plasma
membranes, whereas there was no staining was seen in R-(IGF-IR-null)
fibroblast paraffin-embedded pellets (a kind gift from V. Macaulay,
Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, Oxford, United Kingdom and
R. Baserga Kimmel Cancer Centre, Philadelphia; ref. 32), further confirming
appropriate antibody performance for the clinical assays (Supplementary
Fig. S1C) and providing appropriate positive and negative assay controls,
respectively.
P-IGF-IR/IR staining. After initial antibody verification as described
above, primary breast tumors were stained with the P-IGF-IR/IR antibody
in the formalin-fixed paraffin embedded TMAs. Initially the 5-Am sections
from the TMA had endogenous peroxidases blocked with 3% hydrogen
peroxide for 5 min. Antigen retrieval was performed by heating the slides
in a pressure cooker in EDTA buffer (pH 8) followed by cooling for 10 min
in gently running tap water. The slides were then blocked in 0.02%
Tween/PBS for 5 min and incubated in P-IGF-IR/IR antibody (diluted
1:20 in PBS) overnight at 23jC. After 3 washes in PBS, rabbit EnVision
peroxidase-labeled polymer antibody (Dako; #K4011) was applied for 2 h at
23jC. The slides were developed with 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine (DAB)/H2O2
chromagen for 8 min and counterstained with hematoxylin (EMD
Chemicals, Inc.). Internal positive and negative control slides for the
TMA assay comprised 5-Am sections of the formalin-fixed/paraffin
embedded DU145/TKIR cell pellets and R-(IGF-IR-null) fibroblast pellets,
respectively. Tumors showing no staining were considered P-IGF-IR/IR
negative, whereas plasma membranous weak, moderate, or strong staining
was considered positive.
Phospho-S6 ribosomal protein staining. To assess ribosomal P-S6,
the TMA slides were incubated at 60jC before deparaffinization and
rehydration. Antigen retrieval was performed by heating the slides in
citrate buffer at 98jC for 30 min. After cooling and washing with PBS,
endogenous peroxidases were blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide for
10 min. The slides were blocked with DAKO protein block (Dako
Cytomation Protein Block Serum-Free) and stained with rabbit
polyclonal P-S6 ribosomal antibody (Cell Signaling; Ser235/236) at a
dilution of 1:200 overnight at 4jC. After a PBS wash (3 min), followed by
two 0.02% Tween/PBS washes, the secondary antibody was applied
directly to the slides [Dako Cytomation Envision R system; anti-rabbit
horseradish peroxidase HRP] for 30 min. The arrays were then washed
with PBS/Tween 20 (0.1%) and stained with Nova Red (Vector NovaRED
substrate kit from Vector laboratories) for 1 min and counterstained with
Hematoxylin for 30 s. Specimens with no staining were considered
negative for P-S6, and those with any level of cytoplasmic staining were
considered positive.
Immunohistochemistry for IGF-IR, IR, and other markers. Total IGFIR staining and scoring was performed according to Nielsen and colleagues
(25). For total IR, following dewaxing and rehydration, endogenous
peroxidases were blocked using 3% hydrogen peroxide (5 min). Antigen
retrieval was performed by pressure-cooking in sodium citrate buffer (pH 6)
for 2 min. After cooling for 10 min in gently running tap water, slides were
washed in PBS and blocked with 0.02% Tween/PBS for 5 min. The IR
antibody was applied at (60 AL of 4 Ag/mL in PBS) to each section overnight
at room temperature (#GR36 Calbiochem mouse anti-human IR-h-subunit).
After one wash in PBS (3 min), followed by two 0.02% Tween/PBS washes,
the secondary antibody (mouse EnVision peroxidase labeled polymer
antibody) was applied for 1.5 h at room temperature. The slides were again
washed as above, and then an EnVision DAB chromagen was applied to
sections for 10 min. Aqueous methyl green (0.5%) was used as a

Statistical analysis of the TMA data. Correlations between P-IGF-IR/
IR, IR, IGF-IR, P-S6S235/236, P-AktS473, Ki67, and ER staining in the
clinical samples were determined using a Spearman’s test (SPSS
software, version 13). Patient survival was determined using Breslow
univariate statistical analysis and Kaplan-Meier curves. Patients who were

missing diagnostic or survival information were excluded from analysis.
Results were considered statistically significant with a P value of <0.05.
Models of breast cancer subtypes and BMS-536924. Hormoneresponsive parental MCF-7 and the tamoxifen-resistant subline MCF-7
Tam-R were routinely grown in 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) phenol
red–free RPMI (Life Technologies/Invitrogen). Tam-R cells were grown with
the addition of 100 nmol/L 4-OH-tamoxifen (Sigma) to sustain resistance.
Cell culture for the triple-negative breast cancer model SUM149 cells
(Astrand) was as previously described (33). AU565 cells (American Type
Culture Collection), our model of HER2 overexpressing breast cancer cells,
were cultured in 10% FBS RPMI (Life Technologies/Invitrogen). HTRY cells
were immortalized human breast epithelial cells developed from HMEC
cells at Wake Forest University, USA (34), and were grown in the same
medium as SUM149. Human telomerase–immortalized breast epithelial
(184htrt) cells were grown as previously described (35). All cell lines were
grown at 37jC with 5% CO2. BMS-536924, a small molecule TK inhibitor of
IGF-IR, was kindly supplied by Bristol Myers Squibb. The drug was dissolved
in DMSO and stored at 20jC until use.
Immunoblotting. MCF-7, SUM149, AU565, MCF-7 Tam-R, and HTRY
cells were seeded at 5  105 cells in 6-well plates containing complete
medium. Cells were serum starved for 24 h then treated with either DMSO
or 4 Amol/L BMS-536924 for 1 h followed by IGF-I stimulation for 15 min.
Cells were lysed as previously described (36) and proteins were evaluated by
immunoblotting. Membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin
in TBS-T for 1 h then incubated with Phospho-IGF-IR h (Tyr1135/1136)/IR
h (Tyr1150/1151) antibody (Cell Signaling #3024) overnight at 4jC. Rabbit
HRP secondary antibody (Cell Signaling) was used and membranes were
visualized with Amersham ECL Western Detection Kit (GE Healthcare) on
X-ray film. Membranes were also immunoblotted for P-S6S235/236, total
IGF-IR (Santa Cruz #713), phospho-p90RSKS380 (Cell Signaling #9340), and
total RSK (Cell Signaling #9347). Actin (Cell Signaling #4968) was used as a
loading control.
In vitro proliferation assay of the IGF-IR inhibitor. Cells (MCF-7,
MCF-7 Tam-R, SUM149, AU565, and HTRY) were seeded in 96-well plates
(collagen I coated; BD) at 5,000 cells per well in 100 AL of appropriate
medium. Collagen-coated plates were used as they best represent of the
epithelial-stromal environment that breast cancer cells normally encounter.
Collagen I was selected because it constitutes one of the most abundant
extracellular matrix proteins in the breast (37). BMS-536924 was diluted in
medium and added accordingly to each well 24 h postseeding to give final
concentrations of 0 (DMSO only), 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, or 4.0 Amol/L. There were four
replicate wells for each treatment and the experiments were repeated in
triplicate. MCF-7 and MCF-7 Tam-R cells were also treated with BMS536924 in serum-free (SF) medium containing IGF-I (100 ng/mL) or IGF-I
plus estradiol (10 nmol/L; Sigma). After 72 h of drug treatment, medium was
aspirated and the cells fixed and stained with 100 AL of 2% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) with 1 Ag/mL Hoechst (Sigma) for 30 min. After washing
once with PBS, cells were stored in PBS at 4jC. The plates were analyzed on
a high-content screening instrument, the ArrayScan Reader (Cellomics).
Twenty fields were counted for each replicate well and the results were
presented as an average F SD.
Soft agar assays. MCF-7 and MCF-7 Tam-R cells were plated at 2.5  104
cells per well of a 6-well plate, whereas SUM149 (1  104) and AU565
(5  103) were plated in a 24-well plate in 0.6% soft agar as previously
described (30). BMS-536924 was added at the time of seeding to the cell
layer (DMSO control, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Amol/L). Colonies were counted after
28 to 30 d. Each treatment was performed in triplicate on two separate
occasions.

In this cohort of 438 patients, tumors were immunostained

P-S6 in MCF-7 and SUM149 cells but not in AU565 cells. Because
P-IGF-IR/IR was not correlated with P-Akt in the TMA, we
queried if the effect on P-S6 could be through an alternative
pathway such as RSK. Indeed, we found that in all cancer cell
lines, P-RSK decreased with BMS-536924 drug treatment (SUM149
> MCF7 > AU565; Fig. 3B).
The drug suppressed growth of MCF-7 cells in a dose-dependent
manner from 0 to 4 Amol/L (Fig. 4A, left). We also showed that
BMS-536924 inhibited the growth of MCF-7 cells when stimulated
with either IGF-I or IGF-I/estradiol. Consistent with this finding,
BMS-536924 had a robust inhibitory effect on the growth of the
MCF-7 cells in soft agar (Fig. 4A, right). SUM149 cells were
also sensitive to inhibition of P-IGF-IR with BMS-536924 in
both monolayer (Fig. 4B, left) and soft agar (Fig. 4B, right) in a
dose-dependent manner. AU565 showed a decrease in growth
(Fig. 4C, left and right) with addition of BMS-536924; however, it
was not as striking as the inhibition seen in MCF-7 or SUM149

385) of cases. Positive P-IGF-IR/IR immunostaining was associated
with poor survival when assessed at 15 years (n = 114; 55.3%
positive; 44.7% negative; Breslow P = 0.046; Fig. 2A). Total IR
expression in this cohort was also associated with poor survival
(n = 122; 59.0% positive, 41.0% negative; Breslow P = 0.009; Fig. 2B),
whereas IGF-IR was not (n = 112; 37.5% positive, 62.5% negative;
Breslow P = 0.304; Fig. 2C).
P-IGF-IR/IR is positively correlated with P-S6. To understand
what signaling pathway may be affected, we immunostained for
P-Akt and P-S6, both of which are activated by IGF-I and insulin
in vitro. Activated IGF-IR/IR was directly correlated with expression of P-S6, with 68% of cases having detectable levels of both
(likelihood ratio, 11.57; P = 6.70  10 4). P-IGF-IR/IR was also
significantly correlated with Ki67 (P = 0.018) but not with P-Akt,
ER, IR, or IGF-IR (Table 1). It seemed that P-Akt (P = 0.104; Table 1)
was a less reliable indicator of P-IGF-IR/IR, suggesting that P-S6
(P = 6.54  10 4; Table 1) is a better sentinel marker for these
receptors, although there was a weak positive correlation between
P-S6 and P-Akt (Spearman’s Correlation, 0.102; P = 0.085). There
was also no correlation with the ER (Table 1), suggesting that
P-IGF-IR/IR–targeted inhibitors may benefit patients independent
of their hormone receptor status.
P-IGF-IR/IR spans all breast cancer subtypes. Because
P-IGF-IR/IR was not correlated with ER, we looked at its
distribution throughout this cohort. Importantly, P-IGF-IR/IR was
expressed in all breast cancer subtypes (Fig. 3A), implying that it
may represent a therapeutic target with broad relevance in this
disease. In our series, the luminal subtype comprises the largest
proportion of breast cancers (n = 181 of 226), followed by the triple
negative (n = 31 of 226), and HER2 overexpressing (n = 14 of 226)
subtypes. We found that P-IGF-IR is detectable in about half of all
breast cancers regardless of subtype, with luminal having 48.1%
expression (n = 87 of 181), triple negative having 41.9% (n = 13 of
31), and HER2 overexpressing with 64.3% (n = 9 of 14).
Furthermore, we determined that P-IGF-IR/IR was not specific to
a particular subtype (likelihood ratio, 1.96; P = 0.38).
BMS-536924 suppresses the growth of breast cancer
subtypes in vitro. The TMA findings prompted us to evaluate
the potential of IGF-IR/IR inhibition in vitro using MCF-7,
SUM149, and AU565 cell lines, as representatives of luminal,
triple-negative, and HER2 overexpressing breast cancers, respectively. Each cell line showed activated P-IGF-IR/IR in the presence
of IGF-I, and in each case receptor activation was inhibited by
BMS-536924 (Fig. 3B). We observed a concomitant reduction in

IGFR-IR Inhibition Spans All Breast Cancer Subtypes

Figure 4. BMS-536924 inhibits growth in
all breast cancer subtype cell lines in both
monolayer (left ) and soft agar (right ). In
monolayer (left ), (A ) MCF-7 cells, (B)
SUM149 cells, and (C ) AU565 cells were
treated with DMSO or 0.5 to 4 Amol/L
BMS-536924 for 72 h, followed by Hoechst
staining and cell counting. MCF-7 cells
were also treated in SF medium containing
IGF-I (100 ng/mL) or IGF-I plus estradiol
(E2; 10 nmol/L). CM, complete media.
For soft agar assays (right ), DMSO or
BMS-536924 (0.5–2 Amol/L) was added at
the time of seeding to the cell layer.

cells. To address the possibility that IGF-IR/IR inhibition would be
valuable in situations where tumor cells have acquired drug
resistance, we also studied the tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 Tam-R
cell model. We observed that MCF-7 Tam-R cells express activated
IGF-IR/IR and that activation can be blocked by the addition of
BMS-536924 (Fig. 5A). As in the other breast cancer cells tested,
this drug inhibited the growth of MCF-7 Tam-R cells in monolayer
(Fig. 5B, top) as well as in soft agar (Fig. 5B, bottom), implying that
these tamoxifen-resistant cells require IGF-IR/IR for their growth
and survival. Finally, we evaluated the effects of BMS-536924 in the
normal breast epithelial models, HTRY and 184htrt cells. Although
this drug blocked signaling in the HTRY cells (Fig. 5C), the drug did
not significantly inhibit on growth in monolayer (Fig. 5D). A similar
trend was also observed in 184htrt cells (data not shown).

Discussion
In this study, we found that P-IGF-IR/IR is detectable in tumors
of all breast cancer subtypes and is associated with increased
probability of breast cancer–related deaths. We also observed a
strong correlation between P-IGF-IR/IR and P-S6 in primary
tumors, suggesting that the latter maybe be a useful downstream
marker for activation or inhibition of this pathway. As such, P-S6
staining was reportedly used as a predictive marker for agents
targeting mammalian target of rapamycin in sarcomas (38). More
importantly, we observed no correlation between total IR or total
IGF-IR and P-IGF-IR/IR or P-S6, further upholding the prognostic
value of P-S6 as specific marker for IGF-I receptor activation in
primary tumors. Monitoring P-S6 down-regulation, as we did with
BMS-536924 where this surrogate marker was suppressed in three

Figure 5. BMS-536924 inhibits cell growth in
tamoxifen-resistant cells, MCF-7 Tam-R cells.
A, Western blot showing that BMS-536924
decreases P-IGF-IR/IR, P-RSK (top band, arrow )
and downstream P-S6 in MCF-7 Tam-R cells. Cells
were treated with DMSO or BMS-536924
(4 Amol/L) for 1 h followed by IGF-I stimulation
(100 ng/mL for 15 min). Loading control is actin.
B, BMS-536924 inhibits growth in both monolayer
(top ) and soft agar (bottom) in MCF-7 Tam-R cells.
In monolayer, cells were treated with DMSO or 0.5
to 4 Amol/L BMS-536924 for 72 h, followed by
Hoechst staining and cell counting. In soft agar,
DMSO or BMS-536924 (0.5–2 Amol/L) was added
at the time of seeding to the cell layer and colonies
were counted after 28 to 30 d. BMS-536924 does
not profoundly reduce growth in HTRY cells.
C, HTRY (immortalized human breast epithelial)
cells show a complete reduction in P-IGF-IR,
whereas P-S6 is only slightly decreased with
BMS-536924 treatment. P-RSK was not observed
in these cells, as there is no top band by Western
(arrow ). D, the drug does not significantly perturb

of four cell lines, may therefore be useful in determining response
to IGF-IR inhibitors.
Because we observed no correlation of P-IGF-IR/IR with P-Akt
in the clinical specimens, we were curious if in vitro the decrease
in P-S6 could be linked to an alternate signaling route. The serine
threonine kinase RSK is downstream of mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and does
not rely on signaling through Akt (39). Although RSK is relatively
unknown in the breast cancer field, it has the same recognition
sequence as Akt, binding to substrates with RxRxxS motifs (40).
Thus, we probed for activation of RSK and show that P-RSK is
decreased with BMS-536924 treatment in MCF-7, SUM149, and
AU565 cells. Although AU565 cells showed only a partial
suppression of P-RSK, this may be because they also express
amplified HER2, which activates the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH
kinase and MAPK pathways and, subsequently, P-S6. Recent
evidence demonstrating that HER signaling confers resistance to
BMS-536924 (41) supports this conclusion. To our knowledge,
there is only one other study showing that RSK may have a role in
breast cancer (42). Thus, the discovery that inhibition of IGF-IR/
IR causes a decrease in P-RSK, and therefore, inactivation of P-S6

is novel and brings new insight into the mechanism of action of
BMS-536924.
In contrast to studies showing that total IGF-IR protein
expression is correlated with ER in breast cancer tumors (12), we
find that P-IGF-IR/IR is not correlated with this steroid hormone
receptor. This result was also suggested in early studies with a
different phospho-IGF-IR antibody (26) in a small (n = 64)
historical, paraffin-embedded, primary breast cancer series. In
fact, we show that P-IGF-IR/IR has an equal distribution across
all breast tumor subtypes and is found in about half of all
specimens independent of ER status. Taken together with our data
showing that P-IGF-IR/IR expression is correlated with poor
outcome, whereas total IGF-IR is not, we therefore suggest that
activated IGF-IR is more indicative of disease biology than
total IGF-IR level. This observation may also explain why other
groups report differing prognosis based on total IGF-IR versus ER
status (12).
The IGF-IR/IR family is complex, with structural homology
between IGF-IR and IR, allowing the formation of hybrid receptors
consisting of an IGF-IR ah-chain complexed with an IR ah-chain
(11, 12, 43). Because immunohistochemistry cannot distinguish

between the holoreceptor and hybrid receptors, we interpret
positive staining with P-IGF-IR/IR, IGF-IR, and IR antibodies as
evidence for either or both types of receptors. Although our results
provide new evidence for the relation of IGF-IR/IR family members
to clinical outcome, we cannot address the issue of relative
importance of activation of IGF-I, insulin, or hybrid receptors.
Importantly, the observation that P-IGF-IR/IR is related to
outcome whereas IGF-IR is not is consistent with the notion that,
unlike HER2-neu, IGF-IR/IR is not constitutively active in cancers
rather depend upon ligand binding. Furthermore, the observation
that IR is correlated with poor survival in this cohort is of interest
in the context that high levels of insulin have been associated with
adverse outcome in breast cancer patients and in various tumor
models (13). Additional work is needed to evaluate the clinical
relevance of this finding.
Because P-IGF-IR/IR is expressed in all subtypes of breast
cancer, we assessed the effect of BMS-536924 in in vitro models of
each. Treating both ER-positive MCF-7 cells and ER-negative
SUM149 and AU565 cells with this inhibitor resulted in suppression
of cancer cell growth in a dose-dependent manner, although AU565
cells, which overexpress HER2, were not as sensitive to BMS536924. We also do not see a corresponding decrease in P-S6 in the
AU565 cells, likely due to HER2 being the dominant receptor TK for
these cells when it is not therapeutically blocked. These results are
consistent with the studies of Chakraborty and colleagues (44), in
which they observed cross-talk between IGF-IR and HER2 and a
synergistic growth suppression that was achieved only by
combining inhibitors to both receptors.
The significant growth inhibition in the triple-negative breast
cancer model, SUM149, is noteworthy as it raises the possibility
that at least a subset of these aggressive cancers may be inhibited
by targeting IGF-IR/IR. Furthermore, the evidence that BMS536924 inhibits growth of MCF-7 Tam-R cells suggests that
blocking IGF-IR signaling may also benefit those with acquired
tamoxifen resistance. Our finding that activation of IGF-IR is
important in both tamoxifen-responsive and tamoxifen-resistant

breast cancer cell models is complemented by the preliminary
clinical study reported from Gee and colleagues (26) who showed,
using an alternative phospho-IGF-IR antibody, that immunostaining is readily detectable in tamoxifen-responsive, de novo
tamoxifen-resistant, and also acquired tamoxifen-resistant clinical
breast cancer samples. We also show that although BMS-536924
can block signaling in HTRY cells, it does not greatly effect growth
in these normal breast epithelial cells, suggesting that this
pathway is not critical for survival in normal cells.
The importance of the IGF-IR pathway for the growth of many
types of cancer including breast has led to the development of
inhibitors directed against this target and several on-going clinical
trials (8, 9). We show for the first time that P-IGF-IR/IR is
associated with poor survival in breast cancer, and thus, it may be
used as a candidate prognostic biomarker. Furthermore, identification of tumors with activated IGF-IR/IR may allow selection of
patients that will benefit from individualized therapies that inhibit
this pathway. We also provide evidence that the IGF-IR/IR inhibitor
BMS-536924 shows preclinical activity in all breast cancer subtypes
and in a model of acquired resistance to antiestrogens. These
findings raise the possibility that IGF-IR/IR inhibition may be
broadly useful in treatment of all breast cancers, and justify clinical
research.
