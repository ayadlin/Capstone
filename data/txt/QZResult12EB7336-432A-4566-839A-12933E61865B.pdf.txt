Abstract
HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) are widely used in the clinic to sensitize tumorigenic cells for treatment with other
anticancer compounds. The major drawback of HDACi is the broad inhibition of the plethora of HDAC-containing
complexes. In acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), repression by the PML-RARa oncofusion protein is mediated by
an HDAC-containing complex that can be dissociated by pharmacologic doses of all trans retinoic acid (ATRA)
inducing differentiation and cell death at the expense of side effects and recurrence. We hypothesized that the
context-speciﬁc close physical proximity of a retinoid and HDACi-binding protein in the repressive PML-RARaHDAC complex may permit selective targeting by a hybrid molecule of ATRA with a 2-aminoanilide tail of the
HDAC inhibitor MS-275, yielding MC2392. We show that MC2392 elicits weak ATRA and essentially no HDACi
activity in vitro or in vivo. Genome-wide epigenetic analyses revealed that in NB4 cells expressing PML-RARa,
MC2392 induces changes in H3 acetylation at a small subset of PML-RARa–binding sites. RNA-seq reveals that
MC2392 alters expression of a number of stress-responsive and apoptotic genes. Concordantly, MC2392 induced
rapid and massive, caspase-8–dependent cell death accompanied by RIP1 induction and ROS production. Solid and
leukemic tumors are not affected by MC2392, but expression of PML-RARa conveys efﬁcient MC2392-induced cell
death. Our data suggest a model in which MC2392 binds to the RARa moiety and selectively inhibits the HDACs
resident in the repressive complex responsible for the transcriptional impairment in APLs. Our ﬁndings provide
proof-of-principle of the concept of a context-dependent targeted therapy. Cancer Res; 74(8); 2328–39. 2014 AACR.

promyelocytic leukemia gene (PML) in more than 95% of the
cases (1, 2). Despite that the majority of APLs carry this t(15;17)
translocation, rare alternative RARa-containing fusion proteins have been described (3–5). In the treatment of APL, the
efﬁcacy of pharmacologic doses of ATRA is due to its ability to
release the HDAC-containing repressive complexes bound to
PML-RARa (6) and to recruit the multi-subunit HAT complex
on RARE. Besides having this desired therapeutic effect on APL
blasts, ATRA binds to and activates the nuclear receptors
(RARa, b, or g) that bind to speciﬁc DNA responsive elements
(RARE; refs. 7, 8), thereby affecting a variety of biologic processes in essential all cell types, such as cell proliferation,
differentiation, and apoptosis (9, 10).
The PML-RARa–mediated epigenetic block of gene transcription (11, 12) can also be overcome by HDAC inhibitors
(HDACi) allowing cells to restart differentiation or proapoptotic
events (13). Activation of differentiation programs, inhibition of
the cell cycle, and eventually induction of apoptosis are among
the key antitumor activities of HDACi in cancer therapy (7, 11,
14–16). HDACi cause enzymatic inhibition and/or the release of
HDACs from repressive complexes permitting HAT recruitment, histone acetylation, chromatin decondensation and, ultimately, transcription activation of tumor-suppressor genes
(TSG) or other genes crucial for the normal functioning of the
cells (7). The major drawback of HDACi in treatment is the
broad inhibition of the plethora of HDAC-containing complexes.

MC2392 Induces PML-RARa Context-Selective Cell Death

MS-275/Entinostat is one of the most potent and widely
used HDACi with micromolar afﬁnity for class I HDACs
and with selectivity for HDAC1, HDAC3, and HDAC8 (17–
19). MS-275 promotes differentiation, apoptosis, and inhibits
the proliferation of multiple cancer cell lines (20). The effects of
MS-275 have been examined in human leukemia and lymphoma cells (U937, HL-60, K562, and Jurkat). When administered at
a low concentration (e.g., 1 mmol/L), MS-275 exhibited potent
antiproliferative activity inducing p21CIP1/WAF1-mediated
growth arrest and expression of differentiation markers
(CD11b) in U937 cells (14, 21). However, at higher concentrations (e.g., 5 mmol/L), MS-275 potently induced cell death and a
very early increase in death receptor signaling (22) as well as in
reactive oxygen species (ROS), followed by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytosolic release of cytochrome c (23).
The use of HDACi in combination with other anticancer
agents (epi-drugs such as 5-aza-20 -deoxycytidine and retinoic acid) is one way forward to a promising application
against cancer. In patients with leukemia, and particularly in
the elderly, clinical studies combining ATRA treatment with
HDACi are in progress (24). For example, valproic acid has
for many years been and still is used as an antiepileptic drug
and inhibits preferably class I HDACs although in the high
micromolar to millimolar range. Moreover, even though
there were a lot of concerns regarding toxic side effects of
HDACi in the clinical setting due to the roles of HDACs in
multiples pathways, until now clinical trials mostly showed
manageable side effects (25). The combination of ATRA with
an HDACi could result in improved antitumorigenic activity
(24).
Here, we exploited the synergy between HDACi and ATRA by
generating and testing a single hybrid molecule, named
MC2392 on APL cells. Genome-wide epigenetic analysis
revealed that MC2392 is a weak retinoid. In contrast with the
genome-wide effects of MS-275 on histone H3 acetylation,
MC2392 induces acetylation at only a small subset of PMLRARa–binding sites in NB4 cells line. RNA-seq analysis showed
that MC2392 alters the expression of a number of stressresponsive and apoptotic genes differently from ATRA. Importantly, the hybrid compound acts in a context and PML-RARa
fusion protein-dependent fashion to induce rapid and massive
cell death, RIP1 induction, and ROS production. We propose a
model in which this hybrid compound binds to the RARa via its
retinoid moiety and selectively inhibits the HDACs contained
in the repressive complex via the MS-275 part. Taken together,
MC2392 is a promising candidate for apoptosis-based therapy
of APL, representing a new and effective, single hybrid drug
able to modulate multiple cell death pathways. Our study
convincingly shows that the targeting of multiple signaling
pathways by a single hybrid drug is a feasible and attractive
paradigm for new cancer therapies.

Results
MC2392 inhibits HDAC activity of the PML-RARa
complex and maintains retinoid activity
We set out to exploit the possibility to combine the active
parts of the HDACi MS-275 and the retinoid, ATRA, yielding
MC2392 (Fig. 1A). To explore the activities of this hybrid
compound, U937 cells were treated for 24 hours with 5
mmol/L MC2392, its parent compound MS-275 (Entinostat)
a class I inhibitor and the class I/II HDAC inhibitor SAHA
(Vorinostat). In contrast to the reference compounds, MC2392
did not result in a net increase of histone acetylation (Fig. 1B).
Moreover MC2392 did not induce p21 protein expression (Fig.
1B) corroborating that at this concentration the molecule has
reduced or no HDACi activity as compared with MS-275.
MC2392 exerted only minimal (if any) inhibitory action on
HDAC1 and HDAC4, nor did it display SIRT1-modulating
activities in vitro (Fig. 1C). Our premise for the design of
MC2392 was that the close physical proximity of a retinoid
(PML-RARa) and an HDACi-binding moiety (HDAC1 and/or
4) could convey context-speciﬁc inhibitory activity by a
hybrid molecule spanning the physical distance. To investigate
this assertion, PML-RARa was immunoprecipitated from HeLa
cells after transient transfection with PML-RARa and assayed
for HDACi activity. Indeed, MC2392 inhibits the HDAC(s)
resident in the PML-RARa repressive complex similarly to
SAHA (Fig. 1D).
To investigate whether MC2392 acts as a retinoid, its potential to activate the ATRA-responsive luciferase reporter (RARE3tkluc) was ﬁrst tested in transient transfected HeLa that
expresses endogenous RAR and RXR. MC2392 activates RARE3
tkluc weakly compared with ATRA (Fig. 1E). Consistent with
these observations, quantitative real-time PCR in NB4 cells
showed a similar low response to MC2392 for the RNA expression of speciﬁc genes known to be retinoid modulated (34, 35)
such as HOXA1, IRF1 and, to a lesser extent, TNFa (Supplementary Fig. S1A), as compared with ATRA, suggesting that
MC2392 still maintains at least part of its retinoid activity.
Finally, Western blot analyses of PML-RARa following
MC2392 treatment showed rapid degradation of PML-RARa
in NB4 cells (Fig. 1F) as has been reported for ATRA (36, 37).
Taken together the results show that MC2392 acts as a weak
retinoid when compared with ATRA implying that it binds to
RARa, activates RARa signaling, as well as induces the degradation of PML-RARa (Fig. 1F). We tentatively conclude that
MC2392 is an HDACi in the context of the PML-RARa-HDAC
repressive complex.
MC2392 induces local H3 acetylation
We showed that the HDACi activity of MC2392 is indeed
apparent in the context of the PML-RARa-contained HDAC
complexes implying that acetylation may be altered at PMLRARa genomic binding sites. To examine whether MC2392
induces local epigenetic alterations, ChIP-seq proﬁling was
performed using the H3K9K14ac antibody in NB4 cells treated
with ATRA, MS-275, MC2392, or solvent, DMSO. In DMSOtreated cells, H3K9K14 acetylation appeared in the typical
sharp narrow peaks. Treatment with the HDACi MS-275 had

a dramatic effect on the genomic acetylation landscape:
H3K9K14ac peaks were dampened and spreading of acetylation occurred (Fig. 2A). In line with the absence of global
HDACi activity (Fig. 1B), MC2392 did not affect the overall
distribution of H3K9K14ac. Genomic annotation of the peaks
called by MACS (38) with a P value of 106 (32) revealed a small
percentage of H3K9K14ac-binding sites at promoter regions
(8.74%) while the major portion of the peaks were located in the

gene body (52.11%) or intergenic (34.19%; Fig. 2B). Importantly,
MC2392 did induce low but reproducible local changes in
acetylation at some PML-RARa binding sites such as at RARb
promoter or TGM2, ICAM1 gene (Fig. 2C). The RARb is avidly
transcriptionally induced by ATRA and expectedly H3 acetylation is induced at promoter region. These data suggest
speciﬁcity and selectivity of MC2392 toward at least some
PML-RARa binding sites and reinforced the similar, although

weaker, retinoid activity of MC2392 as compared with ATRA
(Fig. 1E and Supplementary Fig. S1A).
To substantiate our ﬁndings we examined the 1,000 most
signiﬁcantly changed acetylation peaks after ATRA induction
in PML-RARa/RXR binding regions. The intensity plots covering the region of 10 kb up- and downstream for cells treated
with ATRA and MC2392 show acetylation increases following
MC2392 treatment although to a lower level and after longer
treatment times as compared with ATRA (Fig. 2D): a vivid
increase is already apparent after 4 hours of ATRA treatment
whereas a similar response amplitude is reach only after 48
hours of MC2392 treatment.
The normalized tag numbers (in treated and untreated
samples) were counted for all binding regions and clustered
using k-means. This analysis identiﬁed 20 clusters (Supplementary Fig. S1B), among which in particular cluster 2 and
cluster 9 showed H3K9K14ac peaks that responded similarly to
ATRA for 4 and 24 hours, and to MC2392 for 24 and 48 hours

though with a strong timely delay (Fig. 3A). Moreover, Gene
Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that the regulated genes in
cluster 2 are functionally linked to leukocyte differentiation
(Supplementary Fig. S1C). The overlap between H3K9K14ac
peaks in cluster 2, and PML-RARa–binding sites (33) revealed a
common set of 191 loci, suggesting that indeed a subset of
H3K9K14ac peaks are associated with PML-RARa/RXR. The
overlap between cluster 9 H3K9K14ac peaks, and PML-RARa–
binding sites revealed a common set of 183 regions, suggesting
that also here a subset of induced H3K9K14ac peaks are
associated with PML-RARa/RXR (Fig. 3B, top).
Recent studies analyzing the genome-wide PML-RARa–
binding sites not only identiﬁed DR2 and DR5 elements as
the primary PML-RARa response elements but also regions
containing DR1, DR3, and DR4 motifs (33, 39). We found that

identiﬁed the DR1 element in the 191 H3K9K14ac peaks of
the cluster 2 that are regulated by MC2392 (Fig. 3B, bottom).
This suggest that a proper conﬁguration, that is, spatial
position of the PML-RARa with respect to the HDAC(s)
in the repressive complex is an important prerequisite for
MC2392 to physically bridge the RAR and HDAC(s) moieties
and consequently cause inhibition of HDAC activity.
MC2392, but not ATRA, induces H3K9K14 acetylation at
proapoptotic genes
Our analysis also revealed cluster 8 consisting of 774 regulated genes that showed an opposite epigenetic response to
MC2392 as compared with ATRA treatment (Fig. 3C) that is
induction by MC2392 and reduction by ATRA. The assignment
of genes in this cluster to biologic functions (Fig. 3C, bottom)
revealed enrichment for regulation of cell death. De novo motif
search showed enrichment of the NF-E2–related factor-2
(NFE2L2, Nrf2) and Fos (AP1) response element each present
at about 10% of H3K9K14ac peaks (Fig. 3D). Note that the
stress-responsive transcription factors Nrf2 is reported to play
a role in protection against oxidative stress-induced cellular
damage. ChIP experiments coupled with quantitative PCR
showed enrichment of Nrf2 over speciﬁc responsive element
(ARE) of target genes after MC2392 treatment, conﬁrming an
early Nrf2-mediated transcriptional response during oxidantinduced cell death, differently from ATRA, which reduces the
binding of Nrf2 to the ARE enhancer region (Supplementary
Fig. S1D).
Finally, we found an increase in transcription in the target
genes that encode antioxidant proteins or enzymes to buffer
the intracellular redox activities, such as FTH1, GCLM, GCLC,
NQO and HMOX, STK17A. Conversely, ATRA inhibits/reduces
the expression of these Nrf2 target genes (Supplementary
Fig. S2A).
MC2392 and ATRA induce expression of apoptotic genes
at transcriptional level
To analyze the expression changes induced by MC2392, we
performed transcriptome proﬁling on MC2392 and ATRAtreated NB4 cells. The gene expression values from RNA-seq
data were calculated by quantifying the number of sequence
tags for each genes using Genomatix (40, 41). Scatter plots
show the general differences of gene expression of MC2392
versus ATRA after 24 and 48 hours (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
Moreover, functional annotation clustering of differentially
expressed genes by Gene Ontology (GO; PANTHER) analysis
revealed that genes upregulated in response to MC2392 are
enriched for terms associated with protein transport, response
to stress and apoptosis induction. Moreover, ATRA upregulated genes are enriched for terms associated mostly to protein
transport and metabolic processes (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
The hierarchical clustering analysis supports these data (Supplementary Fig. S2D).
Moreover, MC2392 downregulated genes are enriched for
terms associated with metabolic processes and pathway analysis showed the decreased expression of components that
drive cell growth, proliferation, and cell communication such
as JAK/STAT and integrin pathway (data not shown).

Cancer Res; 74(8) April 15, 2014

Analysis of the transcription level of the 148 genes associated
with apoptosis (http://www.reactome.org) revealed main differences between ATRA and MC2392 (Supplementary Fig. S2E
and Supplementary Materials) such as the fast induction of
TRAF2, E2F1, DYNLL2, and DBNL following MC2392 but not
ATRA treatment. Next, we selected several MC2392-modulated
genes related to apoptosis and oxidative stress, which are also
modulated in the H3K914ac levels (Fig. 3 and Supplementary
Fig. S1) upon MC2392 but not ATRA treatment and examined
transcription factor binding. This revealed an increased occupancy of c-Jun, c-Fos, and NRF2 in a time- and MC2392dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. S3), corroborating
and extending our observations that the apoptotic action of
the MC2392 is causally bound to the modulation of cell death
and redox pathways in response to modulation of AP1 and
NRF2 bindings and their downstream pathways. Taken together, the transcriptome and histone H3 acetylome analysis
strongly point to a differential effect of MC2392 as opposed
to ATRA on apoptotic genes.
MC2392 induces cell death in APL cells
Genome-wide epigenetic and transcriptome analysis have
provided strong indications that MC2392 effects are distinct
from those elicited by ATRA in particular on apoptotic genes.
Therefore, we assessed the activity of MC2392 on NB4 proliferation, cell-cycle progression, granulocytic differentiation,
and apoptosis induction in comparison with MS-275, SAHA,
and ATRA (Fig. 4). Interestingly, analysis of NB4 clonogenicity
in semisolid media upon MC2392 treatment (Fig. 4A, left)
revealed a clear loss of clonogenic activity at 105 mol/L. In
addition, two MC2392 analogs that differ for the position of the
amino group at the anilide ring (position 2, 3, and 4 in MC2392,
MC2678, and MC2677, respectively; ref. 42) were used. The
MC2678 and -2677 compounds do not display HDAC inhibition
(data not shown) and MC2677 has been previously described to
inhibit the growth of a number of tumor cell lines, including
prostate, head and neck, squamous carcinoma, and neuroblastoma (42, 43). In contrast to MC2392 and MS-275, MC2678 and
MC2677 are unable to induce a proliferation arrest of NB4 cells
(Fig. 4A, right). MC2392 increased the pre-G1 fraction (Fig. 4B),
a measure of cell death induction but did not induce major
changes in the cell-cycle phases (Fig. 4C). MC2392 did also
induce an increase of the CD11c levels to 24%, thus inducing
maturation of APL cells similar to ATRA, MC2677, and MC2678
(Fig. 4D) but the MC2678 and MC2677 compounds did not
induce apoptosis (Fig. 4B).
Induction of cell death by MC2392 is not dependent on
differentiation as MC2392 readily induces cell death but not
differentiation of the ATRA-resistant NB4 subclone, NB4R4
(Fig. 4E and F; refs. 26, 27). Note that as a result of the acquired
mutation in the ligand-binding domain, PML-RARa can bind
ATRA but it is thought that the binding does not induce the
conformational change needed to dissociate the repressive
complex and recruit activating proteins (26). Thus, the cell
death activity of MC2392 acts independently from maturation
and is likely linked to the HDAC inhibition of the resident
repressive complexes. Taken together, our analysis shows that
MC2392 indeed acts as a weak retinoid in line with the

transcriptome and histone H3 acetylome data but clearly has
acquired additional properties or such that were "masked" in
ATRA and MS-275. Moreover, our results corroborate and
extend the rapid response to the apoptosis/cell death versus
slow differentiation in response to MC2392 treatment.
MC2392-induced cell death involves ROS and caspase-8
To gain insight into the mechanism(s) by which MC2392
initiates cell death, caspases-8, -9, and -3/7 activities in NB4
cells were analyzed. Similarly to SAHA, MC2392 notably induced caspase activation with caspase-8, -9 (initiator caspases),
caspase-3/7 (effector caspases; Fig. 5A and B) and mitochondrial potential activated in NB4 cells (Fig. 5C), thus indicating
that the cell death induced by MC2392 is caspase dependent.
MS-275–induced cell death is caspase-8 dependent and related
to TRAIL induction (22). To identify the molecular pathway
we evaluated the levels of known players of apoptosis, such
as FAS, TRAIL, FADD, caspase-8, and -3/7, Bcl2 and Bid in NB4
cells after 24 and 48 hours treatment. As shown in Fig. 5D and
Supplementary Fig. S3A, MC2392 induced the extrinsic apo-

ptotic pathway, increased the expression of FasL, Fas, and
TRAIL similarly to what has been reported for MS-275 (22).
MC2392 also induced degradation of Bid into the apoptotic
factor t-Bid, mitochondrial depolarization (Fig. 5D) and Bcl2
downregulation (Supplementary Fig. 4B). Next, NB4 cells were
treated with MC2392 and H2O2 with and without the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). The data suggest that MC2392
mediates a ROS-dependent cell death associated with the
generation of ROS (Fig. 5E and F). We further observed
increased H2AX phosphorylation, which is a hallmark of
ongoing DNA damage as a result of increased ROS (44, 45).
The response of APL cells to MC2392 includes the generation of
ROS as a consequence of Bid cleavage, which triggers mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. As both caspase-2 and
caspase-8 are capable of cleaving the proapoptotic Bid we set
out to investigate whether caspase-2 or caspase-8 are responsible. MC2392 induced caspase-2 activation, which is fully
blocked by the caspase-2 inhibitor Z-VDVAD-FMK (Fig. 6A).
However, cell death mediated by MC2392 stayed unaltered
(Fig. 6A, right). MC2392-mediated cell death is also not NOX-

dependent, given that Apocynin, a NOX-speciﬁc inhibitor, is
not able to block apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S3C). Furthermore, NF-kB is neither induced nor transcriptionally activated
by MC2392 (Supplementary Fig. S4D and S4E). In contrast,
when the pan-caspase inhibitor ZVAD (data not shown) or the
caspase-8 inhibitor IETD are used together with MC2392, NB4
cell death is fully abolished (Fig. 6B), strongly suggesting that
the MC2392 mechanism of cell death is caspase-8–dependent.
Surprisingly, necrostatin-1 (NEC-1), the known RIP1 kinase
and necroptosis inhibitor, completely abrogated MC2392 cell
death (Fig. 6C), thus suggesting a RIP1-mediated cell death.
Consistent with these observations, analysis for RIPK1 expres-

2336

sion showed both a strong upregulation upon MC2392 and a
full abrogation with NEC-1 (Fig. 6D). Finally, in line with our
hypothesis, MC2392 induces cell death speciﬁcally in a PMLRARa but not in RARa or PML-driven way (Fig. 4F and data not
shown).
Taken together, our data revealed that at the level of
acetylation, MC2392 induces much fewer changes as compared
with ATRA. Moreover, MS-275 resulted in genome-wide dampening and broadening of all acetylation sites (Fig. 2A), whereas
MC2392 affected acetylation only at a subset of PML-RARa
sites (DR1-2 type). Finally, transcriptome analysis corroborated and extended that MC2392 affects apoptotic genes.

Discussion
Epigenetic modiﬁcations can be reversed by epi-drugs that
are promising for antitumor therapy. In patients with leukemia, HDACi are widely used in combination with ATRA,
resulting in improved antitumorigenic activity. Here, we identiﬁed and characterized the mechanism of action of MC2392, a
compound merging the HDACi part of the well-known MS-275
to ATRA. When compared with both ATRA and MS-275,
MC2392 displays similar as well as divergent characteristics.
Despite being inactive as an HDACi standard in vitro biochemical assays, MC2392 speciﬁcally inhibits the HDACs contained
in the PML-RARa repressive complex (Fig. 1D). MC2392
induces degradation of PML-RARa (Fig. 1E) and differentiation
of NB4 cells (Fig. 4D). Genome-wide epigenetic analysis shows
that MC2392 induces increased acetylation at a small subset of
PML-RARa sites with preponderance for DR1 and -2 type (Fig.
3B) distinct from acetylation at PML-RARa sites induced by
ATRA. This MC2392 characteristic is particularly interesting
and classiﬁes it as a novel class of drugs that need precise
protein-protein "positioning" to function. Moreover a speciﬁc

respect to the HDAC(s) in the repressive complex is likely an
important prerequisite for MC2392 to bridge the RARa and
HDAC(s) moieties and consequently inhibition of HDAC
activity.
The fact that MC2392 may represent the ﬁrst RARa-driven
HDACi is corroborated by (i) its inactivity on human recombinant HDACs in vitro, (ii) its inability to modify general
histone and/or tubulin acetylation; (iii) its selective HDACi
action on PML-RARa complexes; (iv) its enhanced ability to
induce apoptosis in APL cells but not in other leukemia or solid
cancer models. The fact that MC2392 induces apoptosis in NB4
cells and increases caspases-8, -2, and -9 activity suggests that
MC2392 activate both mitochondrial and death receptor apoptotic pathways. Although MC2392 is able to activate the
extrinsic pathway by inducing FAS and TRAIL, the death
response to MC2392 includes also the generation of ROS as
a possible consequence of the cleavage of Bid (Fig. 5D and F).
Indeed, the cleavage of Bid in APL cells occurs concurrently
with early generation of ROS, thereby contributing to cell
death by promoting mitochondrial release of cytochrome c.
For this reason, normally the death receptor pathway (extrinsic

De Bellis et al.

pathway) converges with the mitochondrial pathway (intrinsic
pathway) through caspase-mediated cleavage and activation
of Bid. Furthermore, both the induction of RIP1 by MC2392
and the abrogation of cell death operated by NEC-1, an
inhibitor of RIP1, dictate a complex scenario in which, alternatively to apoptosis, necroptotic pathways may lead to mitochondrial depolarization and cell death of NB4 APL cells. Of
note, both ATRA and MS-275 have been previously shown to
function via TRAIL and FAS induction (16, 22). Moreover, the
fact that the MC2392 caspase-8–dependent apoptosis can be
abrogated by NEC-1 supports a model in which mixed types of
cell death can occur, displaying shared features of both necroptosis and apoptosis. Clearly, MC2392-induced apoptosis occurs
in response to oxidative stress and is orchestrated by stressresponsive transcription factors. Nuclear translocation of NRf2
and subsequent induction of its target genes via antioxidant
stress response element (ARE) may function to buffer oxidative
stress response. Moreover, MC2392 induces the modulation of
a large number of stress-responsive genes (Supplementary Fig.
S2A) and apoptotic genes (see Supplementary Materials and
Methods). Finally, the evidence that apoptosis occurs in APL
independently from a "classical" ATRA response is suggested
both by the MC2392 action in Zn-inducible PLZF-RARa
expression in U937 cells (28, 29) as well as by its activity on
NB4R4 cells (26, 27). Note that in both PLZF-RARa U937 cells
and in NB4R4 cells ATRA signaling stays impaired upon
treatment (27, 46, 47). Excitingly, given that MC2392 is not an
HDACi in vitro, MC2392 is able to exert its HDAC inhibition
only when driven by its ATRA moiety to PML-RARa and
thereby colocalized to HDAC-containing repressive complexes
(Fig. 4). In this way, MC2392 relieves the HDAC repressive
complex and allows induction of cell death in ATRA responsive
and in bona ﬁde APL ATRA-resistant cells. Accordingly,
MC2392 is not inducing apoptosis in solid tumor such as
prostate or breast cancer (data not shown). Moreover, ChIPseq proﬁles show that MC2392 induces changes in H3 acetylation at a small subset of PML-RARa/RXR binding regions but
also in regions not regulated by ATRA (Figs. 2 and 3). Unlike

natural retinoids, MC2392 exerts distinct biologic effects,
inducing partial differentiation and promoting apoptosis, possibly similarly to As2O3. MC2392 displays a minimal or no
cytotoxicity in other kind of tumor cells. Collectively, these data
underpin the speciﬁcity and selectivity of the MC2392. In
conclusion, MC2392 represents the creation of a single chemical entity with dual action thus reﬂecting the concept of a
laboratory-created ad hoc drug, which as a single drug can
overcome resistance in cancer.
