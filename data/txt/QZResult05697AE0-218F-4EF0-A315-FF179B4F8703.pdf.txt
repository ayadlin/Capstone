Abstract
The nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway and its leading
gene excision-repair cross-complementary 1 (ERCC1) have been
shown to be up-regulated in hepatocellular carcinomas even in
the absence of treatment with chemotherapeutics. The aim of
this study was to determine the mechanism involved in NER
regulation during the liver cell growth observed in hepatocellular carcinoma. Both NER activity and ERCC1 expression were
increased after exposure to the epidermal growth factor (EGF)
in cultured normal and tumoral human hepatocytes. These
increases correlated with the activation of the kinase signaling pathway mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)/ERK that is known to be
a key regulator in the G1 phase of the hepatocyte cell cycle.
Moreover, EGF-mediated activation of ERCC1 was specifically
inhibited by either the addition of U0126, a MEK/ERK inhibitor
or small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of ERK2. Basal
expression of ERCC1 was decreased in the presence of the
phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor and small hairpin
RNA (shRNA) against the PI3K pathway kinase FKBP12rapamycin-associated protein or mammalian target of rapamycin. Transient transfection of human hepatocytes with
constructs containing different sizes of the 5¶-flanking region
of the ERCC1 gene upstream of the luciferase reporter gene
showed an increase in luciferase activity in EGF-treated cells,
which correlated with the presence of the nuclear transcription factor GATA-1 recognition sequence. The recruitment of
GATA-1 was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation
assay. In conclusion, these results represent the first demonstration of an up-regulation of NER and ERCC1 in EGFstimulated proliferating hepatocytes. The transcription factor
GATA-1 plays an essential role in the induction of ERCC1
through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway,
whereas the PI3K signaling pathway contributes to ERCC1 basal
expression. [Cancer Res 2007;67(5):2114–23]

helix-disturbing lesions such as bulky DNA adducts formed by
chemicals and radiation exposure (1). This pathway removes
interstrand and intrastrand adducts and is also active against a
variety of endogenously generated oxidative lesions (2). Excisionrepair cross-complementary 1 (ERCC1) has a leading role within
the NER process because of its involvement in the excision of DNA
adducts (3). It acts in a complex with XPF to make the incision 5¶ to
the lesion site (4).
Both NER activity and ERCC1 expression are increased in
platinum-resistant cell lines and tumors (5). The more the cells are
resistant, the more the NER is induced. Accordingly, low levels of
ERCC1 mRNA are associated with increased sensitivity of cell lines to
platinum and increased incidence of malignancies, such as lung,
head and neck, and ovary. Similarly, a large clinical study has recently
shown a close relationship between ERCC1 protein expression and
cisplatin-based chemotherapy efficiency in non-small-cell lung
cancer (6).
DNA damage induced by cisplatin, alkylating agents, and
ionizing radiation results in the activation of c-Jun-NH2-kinase
(JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase, a subfamily of mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) in the Ras pathway, and enhanced
transcription and expression of activated protein 1 (AP-1)–
regulated genes (7, 8). The nuclear transcriptional factor AP-1 is
a dimeric complex of basic leucine-zipper proteins, most often
made up of either homodimers of c-Jun or heterodimers of c-Fos
and c-Jun (7). The direct involvement of oncogenic H-Ras in the
development of resistance of tumor cells to cisplatin and other
chemotherapeutic agents and ionizing radiation has been shown in
different cell lines and associated with increased DNA repair
activity (9, 10). A marked up-regulation of ERCC1 by the activated
H-Ras through an increase of AP-1 transcriptional activity has
recently been reported in NIH3T3 and MCF-7 cells (11).
In addition to JNK, another MAPK, the extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK), is stimulated in response to oncogenic
H-Ras and cisplatin treatment (12). ERK is essential for cell survival
and division, and its functional activity is greatly increased in
human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) compared with normal
liver (13, 14). ERK is known to be activated by growth factors such
as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and hepatocyte growth factor.
Moreover, EGF has been reported to enhance ERCC1 expression in
some tumoral cell lines (15). Recently, we found that some essential
NER proteins, including ERCC1, were augmented in HCC in the
absence of any treatment with chemotherapeutics, as well as in
fibrotic and cirrhotic livers, especially in necroinflammatory
samples, thereby suggesting that their increase could be, at least
in part, related to factors other than the recognized peculiar
chemoresistance of HCC (16, 17). Because cell proliferation is
augmented in HCC and cirrhotic livers and DNA integrity must be

ERCC1 Increase in EGF-Stimulated Hepatocytes

controlled before its replication, we postulated that the NER is
modulated during liver cell growth.
In this study, we analyzed NER activity as well as the expression
of several essential NER proteins in hepatocytes treated by EGF.
The results provide evidence that the phosphoinositide-3-kinase
(PI3K) pathway is implicated in the basal expression of ERCC1, and
that both NER activity and ERCC1 expression are augmented
during hepatocyte growth mediated by EGF. ERCC1 induction is
dependent on the MAP/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
kinase (MEK)/ERK pathway in the late G1 phase of the cell cycle
and involves the transcriptional factor GATA-1.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals. U0126, LY29004, and EGF were obtained from Promega
(Charbonnières, France) and DMSO was from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO). PD98059, SB203580, and SP600125 were supplied from Calbiochem
(Darmstadt, Germany).
Liver cell cultures and treatments. Human liver samples were obtained
from nine patients undergoing liver resection for primary or secondary
hepatomas. Access to this material was in agreement with French laws and
fulfilled the requirements of the local ethics committee. Hepatocytes were
isolated by a two-step perfusion procedure as previously described (18).
The cells were plated at a density of 105 cells/cm2 in 60-mm-diameter dishes
in 2 mL of Williams’ E medium (Eurobio, Les Ulis, France) containing 2.5
mmol/L glutamine, bovine serum albumin (1 mg/mL), insulin (5 Ag/mL),
and penicillin (100 IU/mL)-streptomycin (100 Ag/mL) and supplemented
with 10% FCS (v/v). Twenty-four hours after plating, the medium was
replaced with fresh medium without FCS but with 5  10 5 mol/L
hydrocortisone hemisuccinate (Aventis, Antony, France) and renewed
everyday thereafter.
HepaRG cells derived from a human hepatocarcinoma has been well
characterized for their ability to mimic hepatocyte differentiation (19, 20).
These cells were seeded at a density of 4  104 cells/cm2 in Williams’ E
medium containing 2.5 mmol/L glutamine, insulin (1 Ag/mL), penicillin
(100 IU/mL)-streptomycin (100 Ag/mL) and supplemented with 10% FCS.
The medium was renewed every 2 to 3 days.
Primary hepatocytes were treated with EGF (50 ng/mL) after
synchronization at the restriction point, i.e., 48 h after seeding (21, 22).
HepaRG cells were cultivated in serum-supplemented medium, followed by
24 h in serum-deprived medium before EGF (50 ng/mL) treatment at
different times after seeding.
To efficiently inhibit the kinases, cells were pretreated with the various
inhibitors dissolved in DMSO for 45 min, then exposed to EGF (50 ng/mL)
from 30 min to 48 h. Control cells received the same amount of DMSO that
did not exceed 0.5%.
RNA isolation and quantitation of gene products of interest. Realtime quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was done on total RNA extracted with SV
Total RNA Isolation Kit (Promega) and with the fluorescence dye SYBR
Green methodology using the PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA) on an ABI Prism 7000. Results were normalized with the
relative expression of 18S. Primer pairs were ERCC1 forward, TAGCGGAGGCTGAGGAACA; ERCC1 reverse, GGCGACGTAATTCCCGACT; 18S
forward, CGCCGCTAGAGGTGAAATTC; and 18S reverse, TTGGCAAATGCTTTCGCTC.
Small interfering and short hairpin RNA transfection assay. Primary
human hepatocytes and HepaRG cells were plated at the density of 7  104
and 3  104 cells/cm2, respectively, in 35-mm-diameter dishes and after
48 h transfected for 5 h with 200 AL OPTIMEM, 5 AL Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and 5 or 15 AL of 20 Amol/L small interfering
RNA (siRNA) or 3 Ag small hairpin RNA (shRNA), depending on the gene to
be knocked out 48 h later. The sequences for ERK2 RNA interference were
duplex 1, sense r(GUGUUGUGUCAACAAGAGCTT)dTdT; duplex 2, sense,
r(CACCACCUGUGAUCUCAAGTT)dTdT. SiRNA and shRNA directed
against rat ERK2 and a nucleotide sequence targeting no protein,
respectively, were used as negative controls.

Total cell extract preparation. After washing in PBS, cultured cells
were scraped in homogenization buffer [60 mmol/L h-glycerophosphate, 15
mmol/L p-nitrophenylphosphate, 25 mmol/L MOPS (pH 7.2), 15 mmol/L
EGTA, 15 mmol/L MgCl2, 2 mmol/L DTT, 1 mmol/L vanadate, 1 mmol/L
NaF, 1 mmol/L phenylphosphate, 100 Amol/L benzamidine, protease
inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) supplemented
with 100 Amol/L phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride]. Samples were then
centrifuged 5 min at 1,000g, and supernatants were immediately stored at
20jC in blue loading buffer, whereas an aliquot was kept apart for protein
estimation by the Bradford’s method (23).
Immunoblotting analysis. Cell lysates were resolved by denaturating
SDS-PAGE (10% gel). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes
and hybridized for 3 h with diluted (1:200) mouse monoclonal ERCC1
antibodies for human (Interchim, Montluçon, France) or rat (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) samples, or with rabbit antiserum
anti-XPF (1:1,000; kindly provided by Dr. Wim Vermeulen, Erasmus Medical
Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands), or with anti-phosphoERK antibody
(1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) that detects phosphorylated (and, therefore, activated) ERK1/2. Hybridization with a polyclonal
antibody (1:2,000) that recognizes ERK1 and ERK2 (Cell Signaling
Technology) was also used to assess siRNA efficiency in inhibiting ERK2.
The same blots were subsequently stripped and reprobed with either ERK1/
2 or mouse monoclonal heat shock clathrin (HSC70; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) at 1:3,000 to verify equal amounts of the protein in the
various samples. Blots were also hybridized with anti-p70S6K phosphorylated on residue Thr389 (1:500) or anti-phospho-p90RSK on residue Ser380
(1:1,000) antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). Proteins were detected by
the Amersham enhanced chemiluminescence kit procedure.
Reporter gene constructs and transient transfection. Several
constructs containing different sizes of the ERCC1 5¶-flanking region
upstream the firefly luciferase gene have been used for transfections
of HepaRG cells. The pERCC1-GL3 ( 4,000) construct containing the
5¶-flanking region ( 4,000 to +1 nt) of the human ERCC1 gene upstream
of the firefly luciferase reporter gene was a gift from Dr. Lars Borrmann
(Center for Human Genetics, Bremen, Germany) and has been previously
described (24). ERCC1 promoter fragments were PCR amplified and
cloned directly into the KpnI-SacI site of luciferase reporter gene plasmid
pGL3-basic (Promega). Suitable restriction sites for subcloning were
generated using a reverse primer 5¶-extended to encompassing the
Sac I restriction site: 5¶-ATCGAGCTGCCGGCCTCTCTGGCCCCGCT-3¶.
To include the KpnI restriction site, the forward primers 5¶-extended
were as follows: 5¶-ATCCCATGGATCTCCCATCCCAGACCTGC-3¶ for
pERCC1-GL3( 477); 5¶-ATCCCATGGGACAAGGAATATGAGCAAGC-3¶
for pERCC1-GL3( 730); 5¶-ATCCATGGATGACCCTGGGTTATGGCAG-3¶
for pERCC1-GL3( 975); and 5¶-ATCCCATGGTGTCCCTCACTGAACTGTAA-3¶ for pERCC1-GL3( 1,389).
HepaRG cells were transfected with the jetPEI kit (Polyplus, Illkirch,
France). Cells were cotransfected with the pRL-SV40 vector that codes for
Renilla luciferase (Promega) plus the pERCC1-GL3 constructs. Similar
experiments were done with a basic control consisting of the promoterless
pGL3-luciferase construct (pGL3-basic) and a pGL3-promoter plasmid
containing the SV40 promoter upstream of the luciferase gene. About
100 AL of NaCl 150 mmol/L containing 1 Ag of promoter construct
pERCC1-GL3 along with 0.1 Ag of the pRL-SV40 DNA and 2 AL of jetPEIGal were added to 500 AL of Williams’ E medium with HepaRG cells at the
density of 3  104 cells/cm2. One hour before transfection, cells were
either treated or untreated with EGF, and incubation after transfection
lasted 24 h before performing the dual luciferase assays ( firefly and
Renilla; Promega).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. HepaRG cells, grown to
subconfluence, were maintained in serum-free medium for 2 days, then
exposed to 50 ng/mL EGF for 3 h. At the end of treatment, the cells
were washed and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature
for 10 min. The following steps were done essentially as previously
described (25). Immunoprecipitation was done overnight with GATA-1
(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), p-c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and
Ets-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. Five microliters of DNA

preparations were subjected to amplification by using the primers 5¶GACAAGGAATATGAGCAAGC-3¶ ( forward primer) and 5¶-GCAGGTCTGGGATGGGAGAT-3¶ (reverse primer) corresponding to the region 730/ 458
of the ERCC1 promoter.
Host cell reactivation assay. HepaRG cells at 3  104 cells/cm2 were
transfected with the jetPEI kit (Polyplus). Before transfection, luciferase
reporter gene plasmids were damaged with increasing UV doses (J/cm2;
Biolink, Vilber Lourma, Marne-la-Vallée, France). A total of 500 AL of
transfection medium (serum-free Williams’ E medium) containing 1 Ag of
luciferase reporter plasmid were added to HepaRG cells, along with 0.1 Ag of
the pRL-SV40 DNA and 4 AL of jetPEI-Gal. One hour after transfection, cells
were either treated or untreated with EGF and incubated for 24 h. Dual
luciferase assays were then done.
Flow cytometer analysis. One day after seeding, serum-supplemented
medium was discarded and replaced by fresh serum-deprived medium for
the following 24 h. For proliferation assays with synchronized cells, HepaRG
cells were either treated or untreated with EGF for 7 to 24 h. DNA stained
with propidium iodide (CycleTest Plus DNA reagent kit; BD Biosciences, San
Jose, CA) was then quantitated through the FACScalibur flow cytometer.
Each measurement was conducted on 10,000 events and analyzed on Cell
Quest and Modfit Mac V2 Softwares (BD Biosciences).
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as the mean F SD. The
statistical analyses were carried out using Student’s t test with Statistica
software program (StatSoft, Maisons-Alfort, France). A P value <0.05 was
considered as statistically significant.

exposed to EGF (50 ng/mL) for different times. The percentages of S phases
were determined by flow cytometry. B, NER activity was measured by the host

EGF increases NER activity in human hepatoma HepaRG
cells. First, the influence of EGF on HepaRG cell proliferation
activity was estimated by treating the cells with 50 ng/mL EGF for
either 7, 12, 24, or 30 h. HepaRG cells were used 2 days after plating
and arrested in the G1 phase by a 24-h serum starvation before
either addition of the growth factor or not. In control culture, only
3.8 F 1.8% cells were found in the S phase as measured by flow
cytometry analysis (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, in EGF-treated cultures,
the percentage of S phase reached 22 F 2% after a 24-h treatment.
A stimulating effect was no longer observed after 30 h of treatment.
Second, to estimate the effect of EGF on NER activity, the host cell
reactivation assay was done. The cells were transfected with UVdamaged plasmids containing a luciferase reporter gene unable to
express luciferase activity unless repaired by NER. A dose response
was evidenced in control cells transfected with the differently
damaged plasmids: the more the plasmids were irradiated, the
less the luciferase reporter gene was expressed. Twenty-four–hour
EGF-treated cells exhibited a significant enhanced repair of UVdamaged plasmid after an irradiation of 0.08 J/cm2 (Fig. 1B).
NER increase is correlated with ERCC1 expression. To further
elucidate the mechanism by which EGF increased NER activity in
HepaRG cells, we analyzed the expression of the main enzymes
involved in the NER machinery. The levels of mRNA encoding XPA,
XPB, XPC, XPD, XPF, XPG, ERCC1, CSA, CSB, and hHR23B were
estimated in proliferating HepaRG cells (3 days after seeding) using
the RT-qPCR approach. Interestingly, only ERCC1 mRNA levels
were significantly augmented after EGF treatment (Table 1). The
increase was evidenced at the mRNA and protein levels after 3 h,
peaked after 7 to 12 h, and was still significant after 24 h (Fig. 2A
and B). Because EGF is known to stimulate cell proliferation
through the activation of the MAPK pathway, phosphorylation of
ERK was studied by immunoblotting. Phosphorylated ERK was
shown as early as 30 min after EGF treatment and was still
observed after 24 h (Fig. 2B).
Because a 7-h treatment with EGF seemed to be optimal for
ERCC1 increase at both mRNA and protein levels as well as for ERK

activation in our culture conditions, this duration of treatment was
selected to study the EGF effect on HepaRG cells at different times
of culture. As illustrated in Fig. 2C and D, EGF increased ERCC1
mRNA and protein levels, whether the cells were treated 1, 3, or
6 days after seeding corresponding to 19%, 13%, and 6% of cells in
S phase, respectively (data not shown). No change was observed in
XPF protein content after EGF treatment (Fig. 2D).
ERCC1 increase by EGF is related to MAPK MEK/ERK. In
standard culture conditions, primary human hepatocytes are
blocked in the G1 phase. To determine whether ERCC1 was also
increased in dividing normal adult human hepatocytes, nine
distinct primary human hepatocyte populations were treated with
EGF for 7 h. In all experiments, ERCC1 mRNA levels were found to
be augmented in cell populations stimulated by the growth factor
(Fig. 3A). The increase factor ranged between 2 and 8, and when

the median increase factor was compared with that measured in
HepaRG cells, it was found to be similar in both cultures (4.0 versus
3.3). ERCC1 increase was confirmed at the protein level in EGFtreated human hepatocytes by immunoblotting (Fig. 3B).
EGF has a broad specificity on MAPK pathways. It can activate
p38 and JNK pathways that are implied in stress signaling and
apoptosis as well as MEK/ERK and another kinase pathway, PI3K,
that are involved in cell survival and proliferation of hepatocytes.
To characterize the role of these kinases, ERCC1 induction upon
an EGF treatment of human hepatocytes was assessed in the
presence of specific inhibitors of the different pathways (Table 2).
SB203580 (5 Amol/L) and SP600125 (15 Amol/L), used to block,
respectively, the p38 and JNK pathways, did not prevent ERCC1
induction by EGF. By contrast, preventing MEK/ERK activation by
EGF with two specific inhibitors, U0126 (50 Amol/L) and PD98059

(75 Amol/L), led to a strong reduction of ERCC1 mRNA induction.
This effect was more important with U0126 likely due to a higher
stability and efficacy of this compound toward MEK/ERK
inhibition (26). Interestingly, inhibition of the PI3K pathway by
LY29004 (10 Amol/L) resulted in a decrease of ERCC1 basal
expression and, consequently, a decrease of ERCC1 mRNA levels in
cells treated with EGF (Table 2). Involvement of the MEK/ERK
pathway in ERCC1 mRNA induction by EGF was confirmed in nine
independent primary human hepatocyte populations by both RTqPCR and immunoblotting using U0126 as a specific inhibitor
(Fig. 3A and B).
Second, we extend our results to human tumoral hepatocytes in
which U0126 treatment led to an inhibition of ERCC1 mRNA and
protein levels. To confirm the influence of the MEK/ERK pathway
on ERCC1 expression, we used two distinct sequence-specific
siRNAs, allowing to specifically inhibit ERK2, the main isoform
increased by EGF. Our results showed that ERCC1 transcripts were
no longer activated by EGF in HepaRG cells when ERK2 was
inhibited with either D1 or D2 duplex (Fig. 4A); this finding
was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 4B). The same observation
was made with primary human hepatocytes (data not shown).
Moreover, phosphorylation of p90RSK, recognized to be
activated by ERK1 and 2 in response to growth factors (27),
decreased in the presence of siERK2 (Fig. 5B). Similarly, phospho-

p70S6K diminished when ERK2 was abolished, confirming that
p70S6K is located downstream ERK2 in both human hepatoma
cells and normal hepatocytes (Fig. 4B; ref. 28).
To establish the influence of the PI3K pathway in basal and EGFinduced ERCC1 expression, human hepatocarcinoma cells HuH7
were transfected with two distinct shRNA directed against FKBP12rapamycin-associated protein or mammalian target of rapamycin
(FRAP/mTOR), a protein kinase of the PI3K signaling pathway
(29). Western blot analysis showed a 60% decrease in FRAP/mTOR
expression in the presence of shRNA, compared with hepatocytes
treated with control-shRNA (Fig. 4C). In the presence of FRAP/
mTOR shRNA, ERCC1 basal expression highly decreased. Induction
by EGF still occurred at a lower extent than in corresponding
control cells. Taken altogether, these results showed that ERK2 is
essential for ERCC1 increase by EGF, whereas the PI3K pathway
plays a role in basal expression of ERCC1. Interestingly, as a
positive control, shRNA against the EGF receptor completely
blocked ERCC1 induction by EGF but not basal expression
(Fig. 4C), confirming the crucial role of the EGF receptor in the
induction of ERCC1 mediated by EGF.
Mechanisms involved in ERCC1 mRNA increase by EGF. To
further understand the mechanisms of ERCC1 induction by EGF,
we first determined whether an active transcriptional activity was
required. Human hepatocytes were cotreated with actinomycin

(nt 23,054–23,062; M63796), suggesting that at least one of these
three factors is involved in ERCC1 regulation by EGF (Fig. 5A).
Consequently, to determine whether AP-1, Ets-1, or GATA-1–
binding sequences were involved in the transcriptional activation
of the ERCC1 gene after EGF treatment, we did a chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay using corresponding specific
antibodies and a nonspecific immunoglobulin G as a negative
control (Fig. 5B ). An increase of a specific PCR product
corresponding to GATA-1 was readily detected, whereas no change
was evidenced in c-Jun and Ets-1 PCR products after EGF
treatment, thereby suggesting that only GATA-1 is involved in
ERCC1 induction mediated by EGF through the MAPK pathway. To
confirm this result, pERCC1-GL3 ( 730) mutated in the GATA-1
binding site was transfected in HepaRG cells, and as illustrated in
Fig. 5C, ERCC1 induction by EGF was totally suppressed. Moreover,
the presence of U0126 completely abolished GATA-1 binding to
ERCC1 promotor, confirming the implication of MEK/ERK
pathway in ERCC1 induction (Fig. 5D).

Discussion

(3 Ag/mL) and EGF for 7 h. No ERCC1 mRNA induction was
detected in the three different cell populations exposed to
actinomycin (data not shown).
To determine whether regulatory sequences present in the 5¶flanking region of the ERCC1 gene were involved in its transcriptional activation, a series of constructs containing different
deletions of the ERCC1 promoter upstream the luciferase reporter
gene was transfected in HepaRG cells. Transfection with a pERCC1GL3 ( 4,000) led to a 5-fold induction after a 24-h EGF treatment
(data not shown). The pERCC1-GL3 ( 1,389), pERCC1-GL3 ( 975),
and pERCC1-GL3 ( 730) constructs containing the corresponding
5¶-flanking regions of the ERCC1 promoter upstream of the firefly
luciferase reporter gene and obtained after successive deletions of
the ERCC1 5¶-flanking region also led to a significant induction
(Fig. 5A). By contrast, a nearly complete loss of activity was
observed with the pERCC1-GL3 ( 477) construct, suggesting that
the region between 477 and 730 contains some regulatory
sequences essential for ERCC1 responsiveness to EGF in human
hepatocytes. This region is also implicated in the basal expression
of ERCC1 as a high drop was observed between the two constructs.
A myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1) transcription factor is also localized
at position 509 to 503 but does not seem to be implicated in
this decrease contrary to the other one at position 324 to 298
recently reported to repressively regulate ERCC1 expression upon
cisplatin exposure in ovarian cancer cells (30). Moreover, the
decrease was much higher in hepatic cells than in HeLa cells (data
not shown); this could be due to the presence of the hepatospecific
sequence HNF1 at position 584/ 591.
Analysis of human ERCC1 promoter sequence with TFSEARCH
(31) led to identify several transcription factor motifs that could be
activated by the MEK/ERK pathway. In particular, that region
contains two Ets-1 motifs located from 541 to 550 (nt 23,079–
23,088; M63796) and from 598 to 606 (nt 23,136–23,145;
M63796), one GATA-1 motif located from 491 to 499 (nt
23,030–23,040; M63796), and two AP-1 motifs located from 591
to 600 (nt 23,129–23,136; M63796) and from 515 to 523

In the present report, we show that both NER activity and
expression of ERCC1 increased in both normal and tumoral human
hepatocytes induced to proliferate under stimulation by EGF. The
increase seems to be directly correlated to the activation of the
MEK/ERK pathway and the transcriptional factor GATA-1.
The peak of NER increase occurred after a 7-h treatment with
EGF of normal adult hepatocytes corresponding to mid-late G1
phase and paralleling increased activation of the MERK/ERK
signaling pathway (21). It is well known that the late G1 progression
and commitment to DNA replication are controlled by growth
factors, such as EGF, through the activation of the MERK/ERK
pathway that allows hepatocytes to cross the restriction point.
Similarly, an increase in NER activity and ERCC1 expression was
observed in vivo around 8 to 10 h after partial hepatectomy in
synchronized rat regenerating hepatocytes (late G1 phase; data not
shown). The increase of ERCC1 occurring in the late G1 phase might
be essential to eliminate DNA adducts before the S phase to avoid
nucleotide misincorporations and, consequently, possible mutations in DNA. Further investigations would be necessary to clarify
this mechanism of induction in the presence of DNA adducts and to
characterize ERCC1 regulation during the other cell cycle phases,
especially the G2-M transition. All these results, which are totally
supported by those obtained with HepaRG cells, favor the
conclusion that NER is up-regulated during hepatocyte growth
stimulated by growth factor, whether the cells are normal or
transformed. The increase in NER activity and ERCC1 expression by
EGF treatment is therefore not specific of tumoral hepatocytes.
However, it must be borne in mind that although in normal adult
liver, hepatocytes are quiescent, in HCC they are in a growing state,
and the MEK/ERK signaling pathway is constantly activated (14),
making our present observations in total agreement with those
showing ERCC1 up-regulation in HCC compared with normal liver
in vivo (16).
To more precisely investigate the regulation of NER capacity
during hepatocyte proliferation, the main rate-limiting proteins
were analyzed. Among the seven essential NER transcripts studied
in proliferating normal and tumoral hepatocytes, only the
expression of ERCC1 was up-regulated in parallel to NER activity.
Even XPF that forms an heterodimer with ERCC1 remained
unchanged, leading to the conclusion that ERCC1 could be rate

limiting in the NER process and consequently directly related to
hepatocyte growth. The absence of any change in XPF content is
supported by the fact that only a low XPF amount is required for
ERCC1 activity (32). These observations contrast with those
reported in various cell lines and tumors resistant to platinumbased chemotherapeutic agents as well as in fibrotic/cirrhotic
livers and hepatocellular carcinoma in which additional NER
proteins were also found to be increased (16, 17, 33, 34). Such
discrepancies are unclear and they could be explained by the
involvement of factors other than EGF-stimulated growth activity
in the induction of NER proteins, in particular a production of

reactive oxygen species and/or proinflammatory mediators in the
in vivo situations. Further studies are required to clarify this point.
MEK/ERK and PI3K are the two major signaling cascades
controlling the mitogenic response of hepatocytes to growth
factors, whereas JNK and p38 are rather linked to stress signaling
and apoptosis. To show the direct involvement of these kinases in
ERCC1 regulation, specific inhibitors were used. The specific
inhibitors, U0126 and PD98059, for MERK/ERK prevented ERCC1
induction. Addition of SP600125 and SB203580, specific inhibitors
of, respectively, JNK and p38 pathways, was without effect, whereas
LY29004, a PI3K inhibitor, decreased the basal level of ERCC1. The

implication of ERK2 in ERCC1 induction was confirmed by the
inhibition of this regulation in liver cells transfected with siRNA
ERK2. Furthermore, we confirmed that the PI3K pathway
decreased ERCC1 basal expression by using shRNA against
FRAP/mTOR, a key kinase involved in this pathway (28, 29). These
findings led to the conclusion that mostly ERK2 regulated the
growth factor induction of ERCC1 expression in proliferating
normal and tumoral hepatocytes, whereas the PI3K pathway was
mainly involved in ERCC1 basal expression.
In cisplatin-resistant cell lines, ERCC1 was found to be markedly
augmented by activated H-Ras through an increase in AP-1
transcriptional activity and a direct interaction of c-Jun and

www.aacrjournals.org

c-Fos to AP-1 binding sites of the ERCC1 promoter (11). Two AP-1
motifs were found to be crucial, a distal one, identical to our 515
to 523 sequence, and a proximal one located from 362 to 368.
A mutation in either motif resulted in a 40% inhibition, whereas a
double mutation gave a marked inhibition reaching 80% in NIH3T3
and MCF7 cells. In HepaRG cells, transfection experiments with
constructs containing successive deletions of the ERCC1 gene
5¶-flanking region clearly indicated that most of the responsiveness
of ERCC1 promoter to EGF was located between 730 and 477,
showing that the proximal AP-1 motif was not involved. Based on
our ChIP experiments, the distal AP-1 motif seemed to be similarly
not implicated. These results led us to postulate that the increase

in NER activity and ERCC1 expression in EGF-stimulated
hepatocytes results from a different mechanism from that
occurring in cisplatin-resistant nonhepatic tumoral cells. This idea
has been reinforced by recent data demonstrating a synergistic
interaction between the transcription factors AP-1 ( 375 to 355)
and MZF1 ( 324 to 298); such an effect is responsible for ERCC1
promoter activity activation upon cisplatin exposure in ovarian
cancer cell lines (30) and seems not implicated in ERCC1
regulation by EGF.
The ERCC1 promoter region between 730 and 477 contains
several binding sites for other transcriptional factors including two
Ets-1 and one GATA-1. Ets-1 has been shown to be correlated with
increased cisplatin resistance and to activate various genes,
including ERCC1, in human ovarian carcinoma cells (35). Moreover,
a synergic action with c-Fos on different target genes has been
suggested (36), and this factor has also been reported to be a
potential target for reactive oxygen species and to be regulated by
growth factors. ChIP experiments did not support the involvement
of Ets-1 in ERCC1 induction in EGF-treated hepatocytes.
GATA-1 belongs to a family of transcriptional factors with two
conserved zinc finger DNA-binding motifs and currently comprising six members (37). It is abundantly expressed and regulates the
transcription of many cell cycle genes in erythroid cells (38). Little
knowledge exists regarding its involvement in the regulation of
human liver genes; however, it has been shown to regulate the
expression of the HFE gene (39). Our results using the ChIP
approach and mutant GATA-1 clearly show that GATA-1 plays an
essential role in EGF-mediated induction of ERCC1 through the
MAPK signaling pathway. This conclusion is in agreement with a
recent report showing that GATA-1 is a MAPK substrate in
hematopoietic cell lines and contains at least six constitutive
phosphorylation sites (40). It is, moreover, supported by our
recent observation that GATA-1 protein content is also increased
by EGF in HepaRG cells (data not shown). In addition, ERCC1
mRNA induction by EGF was also abolished by LY29004, a specific
inhibitor of the PI3K/AKT pathway, suggesting that GATA-1 is
similarly a PI3K substrate, as recently shown in erythroid cells
(41). All these observations lead to the conclusion that GATA-1
can be activated by both the MERK/ERK and the PI3K signaling
pathways in hepatocytes. Further studies are, however, needed to
dissect the PI3K implication and to identify the sites of
phosphorylation in GATA-1 implicated in ERCC1 induction
through the two kinase pathways.
The present study shows that NER was increased by EGF
independently of any exogenous genotoxic stress in growing
normal and tumoral hepatocytes. Moreover, ERCC1 knock-out
mice display features of senescence, profound cell abnormalities in

the liver including accelerated hepatocyte polyploidy, the level of
ploidy being the same in 3-week-old ERCC1 / mice as in 2-yearold wild-type mice, and blockage of hepatocytes in the G2 phase
(42), and die before weaning from liver failure (42, 43). They are
also infertile and show increased levels of DNA strand breaks and
oxidative DNA damage in the testis (44). Moreover, reduction of the
ratio of chromatid exchanges to breaks in ERCC1-deficient cell
lines has been attributed to the loss of the recombination repair
process rather than the NER (45). Indeed, unlike other NER
proteins, ERCC1 and XPF are also involved in the recombination
repair pathways distinct from NER (46, 47). It has been shown that
DNA double strand breaks (DSB) can arise from aborted stalled
replication fork, and that interstrand cross-links occurring during
normal metabolism or cancer chemotherapy can form DSB
through progression in the S phase (48, 49). Interstrand crosslinks–induced DSB require ERCC1/XPF to be repaired (48, 50).
Consequently, it may be postulated that ERCC1 increases during
EGF-stimulated liver cell growth could favor repair of DNA lesions
by NER before replication and by recombination during the
replication phase. On this basis, NER and ERCC1 increase could be
interpreted as a protective response of the hepatocytes to the risk
of DNA damage before replication and the ERCC1 increase as not
exclusively related to NER augmentation.
To our best knowledge, our results represent the first demonstration of a direct correlation between cell proliferation stimulated by
a growth factor and up-regulation of NER activity and ERCC1
expression and provide evidence that ERCC1 increase is related to
the activation of MEK/ERK. Moreover, whereas AP-1, known to be
activated by factors other than growth factors, such as oxidative
stress, as well as Ets-1 have been shown to be implicated in ERCC1
increase during cisplatin-based chemotherapy and exposure of cell
lines to cisplatin, another transcriptional factor, GATA-1, seems
to be primarily involved in ERCC1 induction through the MAPK
pathway.
