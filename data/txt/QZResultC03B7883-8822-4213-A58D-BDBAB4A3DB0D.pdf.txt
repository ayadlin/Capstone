Why RECIST Works and Why It Should Stay

Abstract
Assessing that the efﬁcacy of a cancer therapeutic is an integral part of its path to regulatory approval, we review
the history that led to our current assessment method, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).
We describe the efforts of Moertel and Hanley to standardize response assessments in lymphoid malignancies and
how this was adapted in the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Two decades later, RECIST was advanced
to streamline WHO and improve its reproducibility. We describe the ways in which thresholds established by
Moertel and Hanley to provide accuracy and reproducibility evolved to become measures of efﬁcacy and why they
have been valuable. While we recognize RECIST is far from perfect—in need of modiﬁcation as a measure of
efﬁcacy for some agents and in some diseases—for the majority of solid tumors, it is very valuable. We argue that
over time, the efﬁcacy thresholds established by WHO and then RECIST have proved their worth, and we
summarize 10 years of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals in solid tumors to support our
position that current RECIST thresholds should be retained. Cancer Res; 72(20); 5151–7. 2012 AACR.

Background
In recent decades, the practice of cancer medicine and
the technology of experimental cancer therapy have reached
progressively higher levels of scientiﬁc sophistication. . . .
There is, however, one essential element of this
experimentation which is perhaps too frequently forgotten
amidst such technical sophistry, namely, the actual
measurement of the study end point. The culmination of
most experimental therapeutic trials for solid tumors
occurs when a man places a ruler or caliper over a lump
and attempts to estimate its size. With this is introduced the
inevitable factor of human error. Although the ultimate aim of
therapy is increased survival, only few of our current
approaches achieve that goal. To search for antitumor
activity in a new modality by using survival as an
endpoint is a far too complex and time-consuming effort
and one that is frequently confused by the multiple therapies
that may be attempted in any single patient (1).

The quotation above is from a classic article by Moertel and
Hanley that appeared in the journal Cancer in 1976. It is a must
read for anyone interested in the history of clinical trials in
oncology and provides the background for how Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) came to be.
Although much (all) of the paragraph above could be written
today, it was in this Cancer submission more than 36 years ago

that the "modern era" of drug assessment began. Those were
exciting times. Nearly a decade earlier in Cancer Research,
Moxley and colleagues had ﬁrst reported on the "Intensive
combination of chemotherapy and X-irradiation in Hodgkin's
disease" (2). Not long after the Cancer Research submission, the
use of combination chemotherapy was put on solid footing
when De Vita and colleagues at the National Cancer Institute
reported on the use of MOPP [Mustargen (mechlorethamine;
Lundbeck) þ Oncovin (vincristine; Eli Lilly) þ procarbazine þ
prednisone] chemotherapy in advanced Hodgkin disease (3).
But as therapies and regimens began to proliferate, it became
apparent that one investigator's assessment of response (beneﬁt) might differ greatly from that of a colleague, and hence a
"common language" was needed. Thus, it was that 16 experienced oncologists treating lymphoma (all men!) gathered to
decide what would be considered a reliable measure of
response to a therapy (1). Their task that day was simple—
measure 12 solid spheres representing "simulated tumor
masses" ranging in size from 1.8 to 14.5 cm in diameter using
"usual clinical methods" that in this era meant calipers or
rulers. Their goal was to establish the amount of shrinkage that
could not be ascribed to operator error and that would not be
found if a placebo was administered. Importantly, the goal was
not to decide what would be clinically meaningful or important,
but rather what could be measured reliably. The "masses" were
arranged randomly on a soft mattress and covered with a layer
of foam rubber measuring either 0.5 or 1.5 inches in thickness.
The participants were unaware that 2 pairs of these masses
were identical in size, allowing Moertel and Hanley to gauge
how internally reproducible each investigator was. The masses
were measured in 2 dimensions perpendicular to each other,
and the product of the perpendicular diameters was calculated.
The results were as follows: When the same investigator
measured 2 identical size spheres, he incorrectly concluded

there was a difference of 50% in the product of the perpendicular diameters, only 6.8% of the times. Comparing the result
obtained by 2 investigators measuring the same sphere, Moertel and Hanley found that only 7.8% of the times, their calculations of the product of the perpendicular diameters differed by
50% (1). Thus, in only 6.8% to 7.8% of the times did the
measurements of 2 identical masses differ by more than
50%. In comparison, differences of 25% in the product of the
perpendicular diameters were found in an unacceptably high
19% and 24.9% of comparisons. Thus, Moertel and Hanley
concluded that "In the clinical setting, it is recommended that
the 50% reduction criterion be employed and that the investigator should anticipate an objective response rate of 5% to
10% due to human error in tumor measurement."
Within 5 years, the 50% difference in the product of the
perpendicular diameters was endorsed when Miller and colleagues reported the recommendations of a World Health
Organization (WHO) initiative to develop standardized
approaches for the "reporting of response, recurrence and
disease-free interval" (4). Propagating the practice begun by
Moertel and Hanley, the WHO criteria recommended that
tumors be "measured in two dimensions by ruler or caliper
with surface area determined by multiplying the longest diameter by the greatest perpendicular diameter." Disappearance of
all-known disease was scored as a complete response (CR),
whereas a designation of a partial response (PR) was allowed if
in either a single or multiple masses, there was a "50% decrease
in the sum of the products of the perpendicular diameters of the
multiple lesions." Both required conﬁrmation with "2 observations not less than 4 weeks apart." Note here that a "50% or
more decrease in total tumor load" is not quite accurate, as the
sum of the perpendicular diameters whereas "short hand" for
volume in fact does not measure volume or "tumor load." But
the important point is the 50% threshold that Moertel and
Handel had chosen as an operationally optimal value had
evolved to become the threshold for efﬁcacy. And in turn, it
was further endorsed in 2000 when the now widely used
RECIST was proposed as a replacement for the WHO criteria
(5, 6). These authors recognized the "arbitrary origins" of the
50% WHO criteria when they said that "the deﬁnition of a
partial response, in particular, is an arbitrary convention—
there is no inherent meaning for an individual patient of a 50%
decrease in overall tumor load." But despite this, they chose in
RECIST a nearly identical threshold for response—a 30%
reduction in one dimension. Instead of calculating the product
of the perpendicular diameters, RECIST measures only one
dimension—the longest diameter. If one thinks of a sphere, a
30% reduction from 1 to 0.7 in the longest diameter yields a
product of the perpendicular diameters of 0.49 (0.7  0.7 ¼
0.49)—a value that is essentially indistinguishable from the 0.5
proposed by Moertel and Hanley and adopted by WHO.
With this as background, one can understand how, some
might argue, we took an operational deﬁnition and adapted it
as a measure of efﬁcacy—without supporting data—and that
we must establish measures of efﬁcacy that are based on data.
But as we will argue, while it may have been fortuitous, Moertel
and Hanley, the authors of WHO, and those who developed
RECIST got it right.

Desist Using RECIST? The Issues
But then why do some investigators, such as Benjamin and
colleagues (7), advocate discarding RECIST? Some complain
that in phase I/II trials, the 30% arbitrary cutoff point to score a
response leads us to "miss" some active agents. They question
why we should deem an agent ineffective simply because it
cannot shrink tumor size by 30% in one dimension. Others
object that in phase III trials, the RECIST deﬁnition of progression (20% above baseline or above nadir) underestimates
beneﬁt by shortening progression-free survival (PFS). Are these
valid arguments, or will we be discarding a measure of efﬁcacy
validated time and again and replacing it with an alternative
that will be, in all likelihood, equally or more ﬂawed? We will
look at these individually, but ﬁrst let us be clear about the
issues. In a phase I/II trial, a drug might be exceptionally active
in one patient but never score a PR in another. Such a drug
might have value in a very speciﬁc patient population but in an
unselected group of patients would be considered by most to
be ineffective. This is not an argument about the validity of
RECIST, but rather an argument about whether drugs should
be developed in selected cohorts or in the general population.
Similarly, in a phase III study, "relaxing the RECIST criteria"
could result in longer PFS values, allowing one to argue that a
drug "helps patients live longer without suffering disease
progression." The merits or lack thereof of such an adjustment
can be discussed, but again this is not an argument about the
validity of RECIST, but rather an argument about what should
be considered disease progression.
Let us also accept that RECIST is not perfect. There are
speciﬁc cases—diseases, even therapies—in which RECIST
underperforms. Not all cancers behave equally, and how drugs
kill cancer cells varies greatly. We may need to make adjustments for some cancers such as gastrointestinal stromal tumor
(GIST) or mesothelioma (8–11). In GIST, for example, investigators incorporated tumor density on computed tomographic (CT) scan and one-dimensional measurement of tumor
lesions in their assessment of a population of patients who
were divided into good and poor responders by the criterion of
a decrease in standardized uptake value (SUV) of <2.5 measured by 2[18F]ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET). Compared with the deﬁnition of
response according to RECIST, they identiﬁed an 83% response
rate in contrast to the 45% response rate obtained with
RECIST. In addition, the responders identiﬁed by these criteria
had a longer time to progression than nonresponders (10),
while in mesothelioma, investigators had developed and validated modiﬁed RECIST adapted to the unique growth pattern
of this pleural-based disease (8). But note here that while we
may assess response with methodologies other than conventional imaging studies such as CT and MRI, or by adjusting how
we measure tumors, thresholds will nevertheless have to be
established and validated, much as we do with RECIST.
We may also need to make adjustments for certain therapies, notably vaccines and even some immunomodulatory
therapies that do not bring about immediate effects but that
may have delayed responses (12–15). Ipilimumab, for example,
is a fully human, IgG1 monoclonal antibody that blocks

Why RECIST Works and Why It Should Stay

cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), a negative regulator of T cells, augmenting T-cell activation and
proliferation. With this agent, delayed responses as well as
short-term tumor progression before delayed regression have
been observed, albeit in an uncertain percentage of patients
(12, 15). And with vaccines, one would not expect an immediate
response that manifests as a difference in PFS but rather a
difference in overall survival (OS; ref. 14). Such was the case
with sipuleucel-T, where the median for time to disease
progression (TTP) was 11.7 weeks compared with 10.0 weeks
for placebo (P ¼ 0.052), whereas median survival was 25.9
months for sipuleucel-T and 21.4 months for placebo (P ¼ 0.01;
ref. 13). Thus, for certain tumor types and particular classes of
therapy, adjustments may need to be made.

RECIST and the Deﬁnition of Response
So let us then turn to the ﬁrst concern: Is the RECIST
threshold of 30% that deﬁnes response in phase I/II studies
too rigid? Are we discarding "active agents" after phase I/II
studies because we use RECIST? The answer to these questions
is clearly no—at least with regard to agents that are worth
pursuing. While Moertel and Hanley were looking for an
"operational deﬁnition," they were aware of the importance
of identifying a measure of efﬁcacy (1). Moertel had extensive
experience in the care of patients, and with Hanley, Moertel
had concluded, in our opinion correctly, that "certainly under
real life circumstances, a 25% regression must be considered
meaningless, and even a 50% regression is questionable." And
why did they think this? Because they noted that "the natural
course of a malignant solid tumor is to grow. This rate of
growth will be variable, and in a review of published human
data. . .a reasonable median for tumor-volume doubling
time. . .could be estimated as approximately 60 days." And
given this doubling time, Moertel and Hanley likely thought
that 25% to 50% regressions would not prolong survival much
more than 2 months and they likely felt that this was nowhere
near the cures so many thought the future promised. Were they
correct in their estimates? In fact, their estimate of a tumor
doubling time of 60 days seems not to have been too far-off as
documented by a more recent and more extensive review (16).
And so Moertel and Hanley would argue and we would agree
that drugs that reduce tumors by less than 30% in a majority of
patients should not be pursued in an unselected population, as
they would likely not have a great impact on survival.
To be sure that many disagree with this and believe that less
than 30% is meaningful, arguing that stable disease (SD) may be
valuable and should not be ignored [(ref. 17); by deﬁnition, SD
is a change in tumor quantity that qualiﬁes as neither response
nor progression. The latter is deﬁned in RECIST as a 20%
increase in the largest diameter.] The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), correctly in our view, has not been
willing to include the rate of SD as part of the overall response
rate (ORR; deﬁned as the sum of CR and PR), considering that
indolence is often indicative of the underlying disease biology
rather than a consequence of any drug effect (18, 19). Those
who disagree have usurped the term "clinical beneﬁt" and
used it to deﬁne a "clinical beneﬁt rate" (CBR) that includes

www.aacrjournals.org

CR þ PR þ SD. But clinical beneﬁt was a term coined as a
"patient-centered endpoint" delineated to assess the beneﬁt of
gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer. Clinical beneﬁt tells us
nothing about tumor size but informs us about something
very important: how well a patient feels. As deﬁned for pancreatic cancer, clinical beneﬁt includes a composite of measurements of pain (analgesic consumption and pain intensity),
Karnofsky performance status, and weight. Furthermore, this
deﬁnition of clinical beneﬁt required a sustained (4 weeks)
improvement in at least one parameter without worsening in
any others (20). As a patient-centered endpoint, "clinical
beneﬁt" is something a patient experiences and not something
that a physician discerns. For patients who enroll in clinical
trials, the overwhelming majority of whom at enrollment have
few, if any, symptoms, the suggestion they have derived "clinical beneﬁt" from a therapy that has not shrunk their tumor and
in fact may not have even slowed its inherent biology is
scientiﬁcally bankrupt (21). Indeed, there is evidence SD is
of little or no value. An analysis of more than 140 phase II
clinical trials that examined both "targeted" and "cytotoxic"
therapies found that, unlike ORR (CR þ PR), SD rates did
not correlate with either PFS or OS (22). The lack of
correlation with survival endpoints occurs because SD is
not a measure of substantive tumor reduction and consequently does not alter the survival trajectory. Thus, SD as a
measure of drug efﬁcacy has no value and should not be
used as a response endpoint unless standardized deﬁnitions are developed and these are shown to correlate with
meaningful changes in clinical outcome, especially survival.
Note here that correlations of ORR and survival endpoints
could be increased if the response threshold was greater
than 30% shrinkage. Similarly, if SD was more narrowly
deﬁned, such as responses covering the range from 20%
to 29%, for example, or as stability lasting for many
months, it might correlate with survival endpoints,
although never as well as ORR (22–24).

RECIST and the Deﬁnition of Progression
And what about concerns that RECIST deﬁnes progression
too rigidly? The current RECIST deﬁnition of progression—a
20% increase above baseline or nadir—has merit in that a 20%
increase in one dimension is a 173% increase in volume when
one thinks of a sphere. Especially for a patient whose tumor
does not shrink, but only grows, a 173% increase in volume is
not a trivial amount. Unfortunately, most of us are lulled by the
thought that it has "only increased by 20%." But should we be
complacent if the tumor load has almost doubled? To be sure,
one can persuasively argue whether a value that is 12% above
original, and 20% above a 10% nadir, should be classiﬁed as
"progression"—especially if it has occurred over 6 months. But
84% of original from a nadir of 70% is concerning, and if this
amount of change was observed over a 6-week interval, it is
especially so. A discussion of what constitutes "disease progression" is beyond the scope of this opinion, but it is important
to recognize that progression is not only about quantity, it is
about quantity over time—and we believe that new paradigms
that consider both quantity and time need to be pursued

Why RECIST Works and Why It Should Stay

(25, 26). Discussions about RECIST thresholds for progression
that do not consider the time element overlook a very important variable.

Validation of RECIST
But more importantly with regard to the value of RECIST,
whether referring to response or progression, is the fact it has
been validated time and again by oncology drug development.
Before advocating "clinical beneﬁt rate" and including SD as a
measure of efﬁcacy, before lowering the bar so as not to miss
"active agents," the sobering data in Table 1 should be examined. Summarized therein are drugs approved by the FDA in
metastatic solid tumors over the past 10 years. Cytotoxic and
targeted therapies are itemized, including many of the therapies that promised so much, but ultimately disappointed. The
29,312 patients enrolled represent a fraction of those evaluated,
as this number does not include patients enrolled in the phase
II trials that preceded these phase III studies and the thousands
enrolled in conﬁrmatory phase III trials. The median gain
achieved in PFS with our new therapies in these past 10 years
is a marginal 2.15 months. The median gain in OS has been 2.16
months. No one can look at these data, which include 48 FDA
drug approvals over 10 years, and argue that our "screening
threshold" is too high and that we are missing active agents. Do
we really want to lower the threshold and spend the next 10

years achieving even less than we have in the just completed 10
years? Do we want to enroll thousands of patients in trials that
prolong life for 1 month? We think there is unanimity on this
point and the answer is NO! We wanted RECIST to guide drug
development and approval. We wanted it to discriminate the
good from the not so good. We wanted a valid and meaningful
threshold. We may have not yet achieved the ideal, but one
thing is clear, lowering the efﬁcacy bar will not get us closer.
To be sure, RECIST is not perfect. As we noted, there are
speciﬁc cases where RECIST underperforms. But for the majority of metastatic solid tumors, the proving ground for most
cancer therapeutics, RECIST has been and will continue to be
valuable. We would argue that while RECIST has been and will
always remain an imperfect tool, it and WHO before it have
proved their worth over time and should not be changed. Unless
of course we want to raise the bar for efﬁcacy and, like Moertel,
look for much greater beneﬁts. In that effort, count us in!
