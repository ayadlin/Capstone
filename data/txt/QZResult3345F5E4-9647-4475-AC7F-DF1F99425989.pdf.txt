ABSTRACT
Several randomized trials have demonstrated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
patients with activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations can
achieve favorable clinical outcomes on treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs). EGFR mutation is considered as a predictive marker for efficacy of EGFR-TKIs
in NSCLC. Here we show miR-200c overexpression was correlated with the epithelial
phenotype and sensitivity to gefitinib in EGFR wild-type NSCLC cell lines. Up-regulated
miR-200c could regain the sensitivity to gefitinib in the EGFR wild-type cell lines
and miR-200c could regulate epithelial to mesenchymal transition through PI3K/AKT
and MEK/ERK pathways. NSCLC patients at advanced stage (N=150) who received
EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib or erlotinib) as second- or third-line therapy from September
2008 to December 2012 were included in the study. In 66 NSCLC patients with wildtype EGFR, high levels of miR-200c expression was associated with higher disease
control rate (DCR), longer progression-free survival (PFS) and longer overall survival
(OS) compared with low miR-200c expression subgroup. In the subgroup with EGFR
mutation, the trend remained the same but not statistically significant. Overall, these
findings indicated that miR-200c might be a predictive biomarker for sensitivity to
EGFR-TKIs in advanced NSCLC patients with wild-type EGFR.

on treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(EGFR-TKIs) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)
inhibitor [2–4]. Unfortunately, only minority patients have
these driver mutations. About 3–5% of NSCLC patients
harbor ALK-rearrangement [5–7], and about 30–40%
East Asian patients harbor EGFR mutation (EGFR-MUT)
[8–10]. Though the majority of NSCLC patients were
EGFR wild type (EGFR-WT), there are still 3–15%
of them respond to EGFR-TKIs with a disease control
rate (DCR) of 40–60% [8, 11–13], which suggests that

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancerrelated mortality worldwide and non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 80% of lung cancer [1].
Recently, with the identification of several oncogenic
drivers, personalized therapy has gained prominence
in patients with advanced NSCLC. Patients harboring
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation or
ALK/ROS1 fusion may experience unprecedented success

a subgroup of EGFR-WT patients benefit from EGFR
inhibitor treatment. Therefore, to achieve optimal
outcomes, EGFR-WT patients who may benefit from
EGFR-TKIs treatment should be identified.
Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is
featured as loss of E-cadherin expression and simultaneous
increase of mesenchymal biomarkers expression. This in
turn enhances tumor cell motility and plays a crucial role
in tumor metastasis and drug resistance. Studies have
suggested that acquisition of mesenchymal phenotype
is associated with acquired chemo-resistance and confer
primary resistance to trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody
against HER2/neu receptor [14, 15]. In NSCLC patients,
EMT was reportedly associated with resistance to EGFRTKIs. Further, mesenchymal markers were found to be
more frequently expressed in clinical samples of acquired
resistance of EGFR-TKIs [16, 17].
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding
RNAs. By binding with 3’-UTR of targeted mRNA, they
inhibit or down-regulate protein expression and regulate
complex biologic processes, such as cell differentiation,
proliferation and apoptosis. miRNAs can act as either
oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes in different types of
cancers [18, 19]. Recently, miR-200c had been reported to
be involved in the resistance of antiestrogen drugs in breast
cancer cells [20]. Moreover, it is also found that miR-200c
acted as the main suppressor of EMT and was downregulated in several kinds of tumors including lung cancer
[21]. Thus, we hypothesized that miR-200c is associated
with the resistance of EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC patients.
To better clarify the function of miR-200c in NSCLC
and its association with the efficacy of ­EGFR-TKIs,

we performed a comprehensive analysis of miR-200c
expression with EMT status, and its effect on resistance of
EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC cell lines. Further, we investigated
the feasibility of miR-200c expression to predict the
outcomes of EGFR-TKIs in 150 advanced NSCLC
patients.

RESULTS
MiR-200c was down-expressed in the NSCLC cell
lines primarily resistant to EGFR-TKIs
Seven NSCLC cell lines (PC9, A549, H1299, H23,
H460, H1975 and PC9/R) were selected to evaluate
their miR-200c expression by qRT-PCR. These cell lines
displayed diverse sensitivities to gefitinib according to
cell growth inhibition assay by MTT (Figure 1A). Among
them, PC9 was a gefitinib-sensitive cell line and PC9/R
was an acquired resistant cell line to gefitinib, other
5 cell lines were primarily resistant to gefitinib. The
characteristics of cell lines are listed in Supplementary
Table S1. The results showed that miR-200c expression
was decreased, and ZEB1, the potent target of miR-200c
was increased in all 5 primary resistant NSCLC cell lines,
compared with PC9 (Figure 1B, 1C).
The expression of E-cadherin and vimentin in
7 NSCLC cell lines were screened using Western blot
analysis and immunocytochemistry. The results showed
that vimentin was overexpressed, while E-cadherin was
downexpressed in primary resistant NSCLC cell lines
(Figure 1D and 1E).

MiR-200c regulated EMT by targeting ZEB1 in
NSCLC cells

gefitinib sensitivity in A549 and H1299, but not in
H1975 (Figure 5A-5C). T790M could be the main cause
of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in H1975. MiR200c could upregulate the expression of E-cadherin and
trigger MET in H1975, but cannot reverse the resistance
to gefitinib owing to T790M existence. Inversely, blocking
miR-200c expression of PC9 caused resistance of gefitinib
compared with parental and NC cells (Figure 5D).

Expression of miR-200c in A549, H1299 and
H1975 cell lines was upregulated through infection with
GFP labeled LV-hsa-miR-200c. To restrain miR-200c
expression, PC9 cell line was transfected with miR-200c
inhibitor. The infection efficiency was about 80%-90%
(Figure 2).
Several studies have proved that mRNA of ZEB1
was the target of miR-200c in different cancers, such as
ovarian cancer and bladder cancer [21, 22]. As shown
in Figure 3(A, B), LV-hsa-miR-200c upregulated miR200c expression and mRNA of ZEB1 was reduced
in the 3 cell lines. Conversely, treatment of PC9 cell
line with miR-200c inhibitor suppressed miR-200c
expression and induced up-regulation of mRNA of
ZEB1 according to qRT-PCR analysis. Western blot and
immunocytochemistry suggested that overexpression
of miR-200c led to a significant increase of E-cadherin
and apparently decrease of ZEB1 in A549, H1299 and
H1975 in protein level, meanwhile, a slight decrease
of vimentin was observed (Figure 4A, B). In contrast,
NC cells did not display any alteration of vimentin and
ZEB1 expressions (Figure 4A, B). A slight decrease of
E-cadherin was detected after downregulation of miR200c by transfection of its inhibitor in PC9 (Figure 4B).
However, miR-200c suppression did not change the
protein expression of ZEB1 obviously (Figure 4B). This
phenomenon can be attributed to very low expression
of ZEB1 in PC9, and Western blotting was not sensitive
enough to detect protein expression. All the results
above suggested that miR-200c was a crucial regulator
of EMT by targeting ZEB1, and high-expression of
miR-200c might result in mesenchymal-to-epithelial
transition (MET). Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate
that miR-200c may decrease ZEB1 to inhibit EMT in
NSCLC.

EGFR-TKIs resistance induced by miR-200c
downexpression was mediated through PI3K/
AKT and MEK/ERK pathway
PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK signal pathways are
the main downstream pathways of EGFR. To explore
the downstream mechanisms of miR-200c mediated in
EGFR-TKIs resistance, we detected pAKT and pERK
expression before and after LV-hsa-mir-200c infecting
A549, H1299 and H1975. We found that pAKT and
pERK were repressed when miR-200c was upregulated
(Figure 6A-C). Moreover, phosphorylation of AKT and
ERK were markedly activated after silencing miR-200c
expression in PC9 by miR-200c inhibitor (Figure 6D).

Patient characteristics
A total of 150 patients with advanced NSCLC were
included into this study. The median age was 59 years
(range, 30–81 years). The proportions of male patients,
ever smokers and patients with adenocarcinoma accounted
for 56.0%, 27.3% and 67.3%, respectively. Patients
received a median of two prior chemotherapy regimens
(range, 1–2 regimens). MiR-200c expression levels were
detected in all of the 150 patients. Mutations of EGFR
were successfully performed in 139 patients, including
73 patients with activated EGFR mutation and 66 with
EGFR wild type, while the other 11 failed the test owing
to poor quality of DNA. The expression of miR-200c was
significantly lower in EGFR-WT groups than EGFRMUT group (0.04802±0.01533 vs. 0.11297±0.04634,
P = 0.049). There was no significant association between
the miR-200c expression level and other characteristics
such as age, gender, smoking status, histological type and
so on (Table 1).

Ectopic expression of miR-200c resulted in partial
restoration of gefitinib sensitivity in NSCLC cells
We investigated whether miR-200c expression
could affect gefitinib sensitivity in the NSCLC cell
lines. Interestingly, upregulation of miR-200c increased

EGFR-TKIs treatment and 41 (27.3%) were still alive
at the last follow-up date of December 30, 2012. The
median progression free survival (PFS) and overall
survival (OS) for the evaluable patients in this study
were 6.6 months (95% CI: 3.6–9.6 months) and 14.1
months (95% CI: ­9.7–18.5 months), respectively.
The PFS in EGFR-MUT patients treated with
EGFR-TKIs was significantly longer than that of EGFRWT patients (12.0m [95%CI: 10.46–13.54m] vs. 1.7m
[95%CI: 1.00–2.40m], P<0.0001). Patients with high level
of miR-200c expression (n=67) had longer PFS than those
with low-expression (n=83) regardless of EGFR status
in the whole population (12.0m [95%CI: 7.37–16.63m]
vs. 5.00m [95%CI: 1.82–8.18m], P=0.009, Figure 7).
Univariate analysis showed lower risk of progression in
patients of female, never smoker, ECOG PS≤1, age≥65,
EGFR activated mutation and high level of miR-200c
expression (Table 2). In multivariate analysis, EGFR
mutations [Hazard ratio(HR): 0.29, 95%CI: 0.19–0.45,
P< 0.0001], high level of miR-200c expression (HR: 0.55,
95%CI: 0.36–0.84, P=0.006) and ECOG PS ≤1 (HR: 0.41,
95%CI: 0.21–0.80, P =0.009) remained independent
predictors of PFS (Table 2).
As for overall survival, patients with high level of
miR-200c expression lived longer than those with low level
(21.0m [95%CI: 11.95–30.06m] vs. 10.5m [95%CI: 7.27–
13.73m], P =0.006). Female, never smoker, ECOG PS≤1,
adenocarcinoma, EGFR activated mutation and high level of

miR-200c expression were the main predictors for longer OS
in univariate analysis. While multivariate analysis found that
only EGFR activated mutation (HR: 0.30, 95%CI: 0.19–0.48,
p< 0.0001) and high level of miR-200c expression (HR: 0.57,
95%CI: 0.37–0.88, P =0.011) were still independent
predictors for longer overall survival (Table 2).

High level of miR-200c correlates with longer
PFS, longer OS and higher DCR in EGFR-WT
NSCLC patients
Our data was further analyzed according to the
EGFR mutation status. When analysis was limited to
the EGFR-WT subgroup, patients with high miR-200c
expression had significantly better clinical outcomes
than those with low expression in terms of DCR (57.7%
vs. 27.5%, P =0.014), PFS (5.0 m [95%CI: 1.41–8.59]
vs. 1.2 m [95% CI: 0.89–1.51), P =0.001, Figure 7], OS
(9.6m[95%CI: 4.27–14.93] vs. 5.0m[95%CI: 3.90–6.10],
P =0.037) respectively, and a numerically higher ORR
(11.5% vs. 2.5%, P=0.292). While no difference in PFS
(15.0m[95%CI: 12.46–17.54m] vs. 11.0m[95%CI:
9.62–12.38m], P =0.404; Figure 7), OS (28.0m[95%CI:
20.34–35.66m] vs. 19.0m[95%CI: 15.86–22.14m],
P=0.100), DCR (85.3% vs. 83.7%, P =0.835) and ORR
(56.1% vs. 58.1%, p=0.850) were observed between high
and low miR-200c expression cohorts among EGFR
mutation and unknown group.

In addition, in the subgroup of EGFR-WT
patients, univariate analysis identified ECOG PS≤1
and miR-200c highly expressed were associated with
longer PFS, while multivariate analysis showed that
only high level of miR-200c expression could predict

a longer PFS(HR: 0.38, 95%CI: 0.21–0.70, P =0.002).
For overall survival, both univariate analysis and
multivariate analysis demonstrated that high level of
miR-200c expression was the only predictor for longer

DISCUSSION

for the outcome of EGFR-TKIs in advanced NSCLC
patients with EGFR-WT.
Several phase III clinical trials have showed that
EGFR mutation was a main predictor for the efficacy
of EGFR-TKIs [4, 23]. However, there is about 15%
of Caucasian and 30%–40% of Asian NSCLC patients
harbor EGFR-MUT, and the majority of these patients
are EGFR-WT [13, 24]. As for patients with EGFRWT, several studies had been performed to confirm
whether EGFR-TKIs worked in this subgroup of NSCLC
patients. The TAILOR trial [11] from Italy, DELTA [25]
from Japan and CTONG0806 [12] from China indicated
chemotherapy is superior to EGFR-TKIs as a secondline therapy in patients with EGFR-WT. However, on the

In this study, we observed that miR-200c regulated
EMT by targeting ZEB1 in NSCLC cell lines and high
expression of miR-200c can increase sensitivity to
gefitinib. Additionally, resistance to gefitinib induced by
miR-200c down regulation implicated the activation of
PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways. Finally, our clinical
results showed that in EGFR-WT patients with high miR200c expression could benefit more from EGFR-TKIs than
those with low miR-200c expression, while no such effect
was observed in the EGFR-MUT subgroup. This is the
first comprehensive study to have found that miR-200c
overexpression might be a potential predictive biomarker

other side, we also found that a part of these patients could
also benefit from targeted therapy. The ORR and PFS of
EGFR-TKIs were 3–14.7% and 1.3–2.4 months, while the
DCR reached as high as 52.8% in the DELTA trial, which
indicates that a considerable part of EGFR-WT patients
could benefit from EGFR-TKIs.
The EGFR protein expression and gene copy
number are the most commonly evaluated biomarkers in
the EGFR-WT subgroup [26]. A phase II trial from China
showed that erlotinib is not superior to pemetrexed as a
second-line therapy in EGFR-WT NSCLC patients who
are EGFR FISH-positive [27]. Further, the meta-analysis
data from SATURN and BR.21 showed that EGFR IHCpositive or FISH-positive was not strong enough to select
suitable patients for EGFR-TKIs therapy [28]. Recently,
the PROSE study, which used VeriStrat test to predict the
efficacy of EGFR-TKIs, demonstrated EGFR-unknown
or EGFR-WT NSCLC patients with VeriStrat “good”
classification would have similar efficacy in secondline therapy using either chemo or EGFR-TKIs [29].
However, larger prospective studies are needed to confirm
these results. There are no validated and reproducible
biomarkers to identify proper EGFR-WT patients to
receive EGFR-TKIs treatment.
MiRNAs play key roles in carcinogenesis and the
maintenance of malignant phenotypes. Their aberrant
expression can affect clinical efficacy of chemotherapy
or even targeted therapy in several cancers. Our previous
research showed that overexpression of miR-21 and
miR-214 are associated with acquired resistance of
EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC [30, 31]. In this study, our results
demonstrated that elevated miR-200c could reverse the
phenotype of NSCLC cell lines from mesenchymal to
epithelial. We validated that ZEB1 was the target of
miR-200c in NSCLC cell lines, which was in line with
the other studies [21, 22]. Previous studies have shown
that persistent activations of PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK
pathways are considered as two crucial mechanisms
leading to EGFR-TKIs resistance [32, 33]. Meanwhile,
PI3K/AKT pathway also plays a vital role in EMT and
PI3K inhibitors and can reverse the progression of EMT
[34, 35]. This study showed that upregulated miR-200c
could partially resensitize the primary resistant NSCLC cell
lines to gefitinib and suppress the activation of PI3K/AKT
and MEK/ERK pathways. All the results mentioned above
showed that close relationships exist between miR-200c,
EMT, PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK signal pathways, which
contribute to the resistance of EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC.
This is the first study to demonstrate that miR200c overexpression might be an independent predictor
of longer PFS and OS together with superior DCR
in NSCLC patients with EGFR-WT. We found that
patients with a higher level of miR-200c expression had
a significantly higher DCR (57.7% vs. 27.5%, P=0.014),
longer PFS (5.0  vs. 1.2 months, P =0.001), longer OS
(9.6 vs. 5.0 months, P =0.037) and numerical higher ORR
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(11.5%  vs.  2.5%, P =0.292) compared with those with
lower expression. The same significant difference could
not be shown in the EGFR-MUT subgroup, suggesting
that miR-200c may be only a predictive marker for EGFRTKIs efficacy in EGFR-WT patients. We also found that
patients with EGFR mutations were more likely to have a
miR-200c overexpression.
With the development of molecular subtype in
lung cancer, NSCLC patients with EGFR-WT had
been identified to carry several new “driver mutations”,
including KRAS, HER2, and BRAF mutations, as well
as ALK, ROS1, and RET gene fusion. Recent evidences
presented BRAF and KRAS oncogenes are involved in the
TGF-β1 pathway which play an important role in induction
and maintenance of EMT in colon carcinoma  [36].
Another study on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in
lung cancer suggested that homogeneous mesenchymal
phenotype was observed in ALK-rearranged CTCs, which
indicated EMT may be triggered by ALK tyrosine kinase
activation and then promotion of tumor cell migratory
properties [37]. EMT appears to be a potential factor
behind the “driver mutation” that influences the sensitivity
to EGFR-TKIs. Recently, our study found that, comparing
with mesenchymal phenotype, epithelial phenotype was
associated with a significantly higher ORR, longer PFS
and OS after EGFR-TKIs therapy in advanced NSCLC
patients with EGFR-WT [38]. Similar results were
also observed in the biomarker analysis in BATTLE
study. While, clarifing the epithelial or mesenchymal
phenotype should have enough tumor tissue and using the
complex laborious procedures of immunohistochemistry
with complicated evaluation standards and subjective
assessment of pathologists. MiR-200c as the main
contributor to EMT could reverse resistance to gefitinib
in this study, which may become a suitable and promising
surrogate to judge the phenotype of tumor.
In conclusion, we found that miR-200c overexpression could reverse the mesenchymal phenotype of
cells to epithelial phenotype by targeting ZEB1 in NSCLC,
which could also re-sensitize EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC cell
lines with primary resistance. Moreover, miR-200c overexpression could predict a better efficacy of EGFR-TKIs
in advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR-WT. Our finding
warrant further clinical studies to investigate the role of
miR-200c expression in guiding the tailored EGFR-TKIs
therapy in advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR-WT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell line and cell culture
Seven human NSCLC cell lines, including PC9,
PC9/R, H23, A549, H1975, H460 and H1299, were
cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM)
(Hyclon, Longan, UT) containing 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) with

37°C with 5% CO2. The characteristics and IC50 of these
cell lines to gefitinib are listed in Supplementary Table S1.

miRNA inhibitor using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After 72 h, qRTPCR, MTT assay, and western blot analysis were performed.

RNA isolation and quantitative reversetranscrip­
tase polymerase chain reaction for
miR-200c

Lentivirus Infection
Lentivirus (8×108 TU/mL) packaging of green
fluorescent protein (GFP) LV-hsa-mir-200c and negative
control (NC) were constructed in Genechem (Shanghai,
China). Cells (1×103) were plated on to 96-well plates 24h
before LV-hsa-mir-200c and negative control were added
to infected H1975, A549 and H1299 at different volumes
to determine the best multiplicity of infection (MOI) value
at which concentrations no virus toxicity effect on cells
was found. 96h after infection, the GFP gene expression
was observed under fluorescence microscope, and the
infected cells were collected for subsequent culture. The
experiment was repeated three times.

Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol
Reagent (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan), and total miRNA of
FFPE tissues was extracted by miRNeasy FFPE kit
(QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). miR-200c and U6-specific
cDNA were synthesized using gene-specific primer.
Reverse transcription was performed using the RevertAid
First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit(Thermo scientific,
Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
miR-200c was quantified in Stratagene Mx3000PTM
(Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) by reversetranscriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) using
SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa) and normalized to U6
according to the manufacturer’s protocols. All qRT-PCRs
were performed in duplicate. Primers were listed in
Supplementary Table S2. Relative quantification of miR200c expression was calculated using the 2-ΔCT formula.
The cut-off point for miR-200c expression in our
study was determined from the “minimum P value”
and lowest Hazard ratio for PFS and OS from every
5 percentile of 2-ΔCT of miR-200c expression. The best
cut-off value to predict both PFS and OS (Supplementary
Table S4) was fixed at the 55th percentile (2-ΔCT=0.01385).
MiR-200c was defined as high expression when
2-ΔCT≥0.01385 and as low expression when 2-ΔCT<0.01385.

Western blot analysis
Proteins were extracted using ReadyPrep Total
Protein Extraction Kit (Bio-rad). Protein extracts (25μg)
were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred
onto nitrocellulose membranes (Pall, Port Washington, NY)
using a Bio-Rad Tetra blotting module. The membranes
were blocked in TBS that contained 5% nonfat milk
powder for 2h before incubation with rabbit monoclonal
antibody diluted in TBS/5% nonfat milk powder overnight
at 4°C. Subsequently membranes were washed with TBST
and incubated for 2h with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)
conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2500, KPL, Gaithersburg,
MD) at room temperature. All the rabbit monoclonal
antibodies were purchased from Epitomics (Burlingame,
CA), including Akt1 phospho (pS473) (1:2000), Akt1
(1:10000), Vimentin (1:5000), E-cadherin (1:5000) and
ZEB1 (1:2000). Rabbit anti-GAPDH antibody (1:2500)
was detected simultaneously as a loading control. Specific
proteins were detected using an ECL kit (Thermo scientific)
and Gel doc XR (Bio-rad). Protein band densities were
calculated by using Quantity one (Bio-rad). Densitometry
results were normalized against GAPDH expression.

Cell growth inhibition assay
The cells were seeded onto 96-well plates at a
density of 5×103 overnight. Gefitinib (AstraZeneca, Luton,
UK) was added in a dose-dependent manner and the
cells were incubated for 72h. After adding 20μL of MTT
(5mg/mL) into each well, cells were incubated at 37°C for
4h. Finally, the supernatant was discarded and 200μL of
DMSO was added to each well to dissolve the precipitate.
The optical density was assessed at 570 nm using a
96-well microplate reader (Bio-rad, Hercules, CA).
Each experiment was repeated in triple. IC50 was defined
as the concentration needed for 50% reduction in the
absorbance.

Immunocytochemistry
In the previous day, 105 cells were plated on 24
wells containing glass coverslips. The coverslips were
washed three times by PBS, and then cells were fixed
by paraformaldehyde for 30 min and treated with Triton
X-100 to increase permeability of cell membrane. Then
cells were washed thrice in PBS, followed by blocking of
the endogenous peroxidase by 3% hydrogen peroxidase
for 15 min and 5% nonfat milk powder for 2h to block
nonspecific binding. Subsequently cells were incubated

Transfection of miR-200c inhibitor
MiR-200c inhibitor and its negative control
oligonucleotides (Supplementary Table S3) were obtained
from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Cells were planted into
6-well plates (2×105 cells/well) and transfected with

with diluted primary antibodies (1:150) at 4°C overnight.
After washing 3 times in PBS, cells were incubated with
HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:100; KPL) for 1 h
at room temperature. Immunoreactivity was demonstrated
using diaminobenzadine (Invitrogen) for increased
sensitivity. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin
and covered with a cover glass. The negative controls were
incubated with a solution that was devoid of any primary
antibody.

We used the SPSS statistical software package
(version 17.0; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL) to perform the
statistical analysis. Differences of miR-200c expression
between two groups were assessed by the Mann-Whitney
U test or Student's t test. A Chi-square test or Fisher exact
test was used to analyze the association between miR200c expression level and clinical characteristic variables,
ORR and DCR. PFS was defined as the period from the
date of EGFR-TKIs administration to the date of disease
progression or death. OS was calculated as the time from
the beginning of therapy to death or the last follow-up
date. All time-to-event outcomes were estimated using
the Kaplan-Meier method and compared across groups
with the log-rank test or the Cox proportional hazards
model. All statistical tests were two-sided, and statistical
significance was defined as P<0.05.

Patients and sample collection
NSCLC patients in advanced stage who received
EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib or erlotinib) as second- or thirdline therapy from September 2008 to December 2012
were included in the study. All patients had formalinfixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples for EGFR
mutation status and miRNA expression analysis. The
tumor tissues were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin,
and stored as paraffin-embedded archival until use. All
tissues were reviewed by experienced pathologists for
confirmation of histological type and tumor content of
>30%. Paraffin sections were then cut at a thickness of
5 μm. DNA and RNA were extracted from 6 pieces of the
paraffin-embedded slides. Objective tumor response was
determined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST version 1.1). The patients underwent
computed tomography scan covering target lesions
4–6 weeks after the initiation of EGFR-TKIs treatment and
then every 8 weeks or when indicated by symptoms. This
study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai
Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji University, and written
informed consent was obtained from each participant
before the initiation of any study-related procedures.
