ABSTRACT
Data on long-term survival and prognostic significance of demographic factors and
adverse events (AEs) associated with sorafenib, an orally administered multikinase
inhibitor in Chinese population with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are limited.
Outcome data from adult patients (n = 256) with advanced RCC who received
sorafenib (400 mg twice daily) either as first-line or second-line therapy between
April 2006 and May 2013 were analyzed retrospectively. The primary endpoint was
median overall survival (OS), determined to be 22.2 (95% CI: 17.1–27.4) months,
and the secondary endpoint was overall median progression-free survival (PFS),
determined to be 13.6 (95% CI: 10.7–16.4) months at a median follow-up time of
61.8 (95% CI: 16.2–97.4) months. Analysis of the incidence of AEs revealed the
most common side effect as hand-foot skin reactions (60.5%) followed by diarrhea
(38.7%), fatigue (35.5%), alopecia (34.0%), rash (24.6%), hypertension (21.5%)
and gingival hemorrhage (21.1%). Multivariate regression analysis revealed older
age (≥ 58 years), lower Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center score, time from
nephrectomy to sorafenib treatment, number of metastatic tumors and best response
as significant and independent demographic predictors for improved PFS and/or
OS (p ≤ 0.05). Alopecia was identified as a significant and independent predictor
of increased OS, whereas vomiting and weight loss were identified as significant
predictors of decreased OS (p ≤ 0.05). Sorafenib significantly improved OS and PFS in
Chinese patients with advanced RCC. Considering the identified significant prognostic
demographic factors along with the advocated prognostic manageable AEs while
identifying treatment strategy may help clinicians select the best treatment modality
and better predict survival in these patients.

biology and the cytogenetics of advanced RCC have
provided unique insights into the underlying mechanisms
contributing to its histological and biological diversity [2].
Consequently, targeted agents, including inhibitors
of tyrosine kinase, vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
have revolutionized the therapeutic landscape in the
management of patients with metastatic RCC (mRCC)

INTRODUCTION
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a heterogeneous
group of tumors with distinct genetic and metabolic
defects. It encompasses diverse clinical, histopathological,
and molecular factors, which also have a role in
differential prognosis and therapeutic responses [1].

[3, 4]. The efficacy of sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor,
in RCC has been previously confirmed in Phase II and
Phase III trials, leading to its approval by the US Food
and Drug Administration in December 2005 as the
first targeted agent to show clinical activity in RCC as
reviewed earlier [5]. Since then, an array of targeted
drugs (tyrosine kinase inhibitors sunitinib, axitinib, and
pazopanib; the VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab;
and the mTORs temsirolimus and everolimus) have been
introduced and are now approved for clinical use [3, 6, 7].
Previous studies, including the pivotal TARGET trial,
have demonstrated promising evidence for sorafenib
administered at a dose of 400 mg twice daily both as a
first-line and second-line therapy for advanced RCC
primarily in the western population [7, 8]. These studies
have shown varying improvement in progression-free
survival (PFS), overall response rates, overall survival
(OS), tolerance, and quality of life compared with other
investigational agents including interferon, IFNα2a,
tivozanib, temsirolimus, AMG 386, and axitinib [8–11].
There has been a considerable increase in the
incidence of RCC and the associated mortality rates
in China, which were estimated to be 2.2% and 1.2%,
respectively, for all new cases of cancers excluding
non-melanoma skin cancer according to GLOBOCAN
worldwide estimates of cancer incidence published by
the International Agency for Research on Cancer for
2012 [12]. As reviewed earlier, previous studies have
shown sorafenib as a potential targeted agent with a
manageable  toxicity profile when used even at higher

doses (1200–1600 mg/day) or in combination with other
agents such as interferon, bevacizumab, temsirolimus,
gemcitabine, fluorouracil, and cisplatin for treating
Chinese patients with RCC [5]. Sorafenib was found
to be more effective in the Chinese population when
compared with the western population both as first-line
and second-line treatment after failure of treatment with
cytokine in patients with advanced RCC, but with a
relatively higher rate of adverse events (AEs), particularly
hand-foot skin reactions and alopecia. [5] However,
data on the long-term survival of Chinese patients with
advanced RCC treated with sorafenib are limited. The
present study determined the potential of sorafenib
treatment on the long-term survival in Chinese patients
with metastatic RCC (mRCC) and further evaluated the
prognostic factors associated with OS and/or PFS.

RESULTS
Baseline demographics
Between April 2006 and May 2013, a total of 317
patients with mRCC treated with sorafenib were screened
at the Department of Urology, Fudan University, Shanghai
Cancer Center. In all, 256 patients (age 19–89 years,
median 58 years) met the inclusion criteria and were
considered for the analysis. The other 61 patients were
lost to follow-up. The baseline demographics and clinical
characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Overall, 53.1%
of the patients were aged ≥ 58 years and 71.5% were

contributes valuable insights into the long-term survival
of Chinese patients with advanced RCC treated with
sorafenib as first-line or second-line therapy.
The findings from our study suggest that sorafenib is
effective in improving the OS and PFS in Chinese patients
with advanced RCC both as first-line and second-line
treatment, with a manageable toxicity profile. Median OS
was found to be 22.2 months in our study, which seemed
to be higher than that reported in earlier studies in the
Chinese and western populations (11.7–17.8 months).
Median PFS (13.6 months) and clinical benefit rate
([CR+PR+SD], 87.1%) were also found to be consistent
with the previous reports from China (PFS, 9.6–15 months;
clinical benefit rate, 80%–88%) and appeared to be greatly
improved than those reported in western populations (PFS,
5.5–6.6 months; clinical benefit rate, 84%–85%). The
objective response rate ([CR+PR], 18.4%) was similar or
lower than that reported in previous studies from China
(16.7%–36.6%), but was higher than the reports from the
western populations (4.0%–10.2%) [5, 13–20]. However,
the baseline demographics and clinical characteristics of
the patients included in this investigation were different
from the previous western studies [8–11]. The observed
improvements in survival, therefore, need to be further
validated in future trials or propensity matched studies
comparing the efficacy of sorafenib between Chinese
patients and Western populations. Ethnic differences
were earlier demonstrated to influence incidence rates
and survival rates in RCC [22]. Overall, the better clinical
outcomes of sorafenib treatment in Chinese patients with
advanced RCC compared with patients of western origin
are probably due to the difference in ethnicity and the
associated differences in molecular features as reviewed
earlier [5]. Polymorphism of cancer susceptibility genes,
which in turn may be associated with the ethnicity, was
earlier suggested as a potential predictor of outcome and
toxicity of tyrosine kinase inhibitors including sorafenib
[5, 23, 24].
The multivariate analysis of prognostic demographic
factors revealed older age (≥ 58 years) to be a significant
predictor of improved PFS and OS in patients with

model for analysis. Older age, lower MSKCC score,
lower number of metastatic organs, and best tumor
response were found to be significant and independent
predictors for improved PFS and OS. Additionally,
time from nephrectomy to sorafenib treatment also
significantly predicted improved PFS but not OS
(p ≤ 0.05; Figure 2A and 2B).

Adverse events
Analysis of AEs in the included patients revealed
the most common side effect as hand-foot skin reactions
(60.5%) followed by diarrhea (38.7%), fatigue (35.5%),
alopecia (34.0%), rash (24.6%), hypertension (21.5%), and
gingival hemorrhage (21.1%). The AEs recorded in >1%
of the included patients during the study period and their
grades are listed in Table 3. Univariate analysis revealed
the incidence of most of the commonly encountered AEs
such as hand-foot skin reactions, alopecia, rash, diarrhea,
and hypertension to be associated with increased OS,
while other AEs such as vomiting, albuminuria, and
weight loss were associated with decreased OS (p ≤ 0.05)
(Table 4). The probable prognostic factors with a p < 0.1
were entered into the multivariate Cox proportional
regression model for analysis. Multivariate analysis
revealed alopecia to be a significant and independent
predictor for increased OS, whereas vomiting and weight
loss were identified as significant predictors for decreased
OS (p ≤ 0.05) (Figure 3).

DISCUSSION
The efficacy and tolerability of sorafenib in the
treatment of advanced RCC is well established in the
global population, while the data on long-term survival
are primarily from the western population [5, 7, 8,
13–21]. Long-term survival rates following sorafenib
treatment are, however, limited in patients of Asian
origin, particularly China, wherein there is an increasing
incidence of RCC contributing to increased mortality
and reduced survival. The present retrospective study

however suggests similar incidence of AEs in first-line
and subsequent lines of sorafenib therapy in patients with
mRCC [28].
Although not significant in multivariate regression
model, univariate analysis of prognostic demographic
variables in our study also indicated high BMI
(≥ 23.1 kg/m2), lower ECOG performance status, clear cell
subtype of RCC, lower tumor nucleus grade and time from
nephrectomy to sorafenib treatment to be associated with
better outcomes including PFS, and/or OS with sorafenib
treatment in Chinese patients. Previous studies also
reported an association of pre-operative obesity, a cause of
RCC, with better prognosis and improved OS in patients
with RCC [29, 30]. Several explanations for this were
reviewed by these authors, including increased fat between
the kidney and Gerota’s fascia in obese patients acting
as a barrier to further invasion of cancer cells and better
nutritional status contributing to improved survival, while
cachexia associated with underweight patients predicted
poorer prognosis [29, 30]. This observation is further
strengthened by our recent report wherein higher visceral
adiposity, a comprehensive indicator of nutritional status
and biological factors, was found to correlate strongly
with reduced mortality in the patients who received
VEGF-targeted therapy [31]. Treatment with sorafenib
as an anti-angiogenic agent was earlier suggested to be
less effective for non-clear cell subtypes of RCC [32]. As
reviewed earlier, deregulated VEGF or mTOR pathways
associated with the inactivation of the von Hippel Lindau
(VHL) gene are important therapeutic targets in clear

metastatic RCC treated with sorafenib (p ≤ 0.05).
Sorafenib was thus confirmed to be effective in elderly
patients, as illustrated in earlier studies [8, 25]. The
baseline MSKCC score was also found to be a significant
and strong predictor for both PFS and OS. Lower scores
predicted improved PFS and OS, while higher scores
predicted decreased PFS and OS, suggesting poorer
prognosis. Tanigawa et al. [26] also reported favorable
prognosis according to the MSKCC risk groups to be a
significant and strong factor for predicting superior PFS in
patients with advanced RCC on sorafenib treatment from
Japan. This observation was earlier attributed to the higher
levels of VEGF in patients with higher MSKCC scores
compared with patients with lower scores at baseline [9].
The involvement of multiple organs in mRCC in our study
significantly predicted reduced PFS and OS, as reported
earlier [27]. In addition, the best tumor response was also
identified as a significant predictor for  improved PFS
and OS in the order of CR > PR > SD > PD (p < 0.05).
Furthermore, the time from nephrectomy to sorafenib
treatment was also found to be a significant predictor
of improved PFS and OS. There was no statistically
significant difference in PFS as well as OS when
sorafenib is administered as the first-line or second-line
treatment after cytokine or sunitinib therapy for mRCC.
These results suggest similar benefits of sorafenib in
first- and second-line patients as demonstrated earlier
in a nonrandomized, open-access trial [16]. AEs were
not compared between lines of sorafenib treatment in
our study. Expert opinion based on available evidence

Sorafenib-induced hypertension was associated with
improved median OS (p ≤ 0.02), although it was not a
significant predictor of OS in our study as reported earlier
[44]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies
in cancer patients treated with sorafenib revealed a
significantly higher incidence of hypertension in patients
with RCC, and the occurrence was further suggested
to be associated with improved prognosis [45]. AEs
such as vomiting, albuminuria, and weight loss were,
however, found to be associated with significantly
reduced median OS in our study (p ≤ 0.05). Anorexia
with or without nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea related to
targeted therapies for RCC, presented as dramatic weight
loss, was associated with deteriorated quality of life
and survival. Albuminuria ≤ Grade 2 was reported to be
common in patients treated with VEGF inhibition, but
is rarely ≥ Grade 3 or nephrotic and is suggested to be
associated with renal dysfunction and/or hypertension,
which in turn may affect OS. Overall, the potential
emergence of certain low-grade AEs such as hand-foot
skin reactions and hypertension is, therefore, advocated in
patients with advanced RCC treated with sorafenib to be
associated with improved survival [6, 46–49].
The retrospective design and the sample size of this
study may be inadequate to comprehensively determine
the prognostic significance of sorafenib on OS in Chinese
patients with mRCC.
This study provides a valuable insight into the
long-term safety and efficacy of sorafenib as a first-line
or second-line therapy to treat advanced RCC in patients
from China. The identified significant prognostic baseline
predictors for improved clinical outcomes with respect
to PFS and/or OS were higher age, low MSKCC score,
time from nephrectomy to sorafenib treatment, number of
metastatic tumors, and best response. Alopecia, an AE of
prognostic significance, was identified as an independent
and strong predictor for improved OS, whereas vomiting
and weight loss were significant predictors for decreased
OS. The identified prognostic factors and AEs will be
helpful in establishing realistic patient expectations and in
guiding treatment decisions to help the clinicians employ
the most suitable treatment strategy involving sorafenib in
order to improve the survival in these patients.

cell RCC. Improved clinical outcomes with targeted
agents including sorafenib were, therefore, advocated in
patients with RCC of the clear cell subtype but not the
non-clear cell subtype [33]. Lower grade (grade 1–2) of
tumors based on necrosis, illustrated to be associated with
improved PFS and OS in our study, was earlier reported as
an independent predictor [34].
The AE profile in our study, compared with data from
patients of western origin reported in the TARGET study,
revealed a higher incidence of hand-foot skin reaction
(60.5% vs. 30%), alopecia (34% vs. 27%), hypertension
(21.5% vs. 17%), and anemia (16% vs. 8%). However,
these results are consistent with the earlier reports on
the tolerability of sorafenib in Chinese patients with
advanced RCC, as well as in patients with hepatocellular
carcinoma in the Asian-Pacific trial [5, 14, 15, 17–20, 35].
This observation may again be attributed to the difference
in ethnicity and the associated differences in molecular
features as explained earlier. There were also events of
bleeding, liver dysfunction, and angina similar to reports
from earlier studies in Chinese patients with advanced
RCC treated with sorafenib [5, 15, 20]. Univariate
analysis of the prognostic significance of AEs encountered
in this study with the median OS revealed a significant
association of hand-foot skin reaction, alopecia, rash,
diarrhea, and hypertension towards improved median
OS in Chinese patients treated with sorafenib (p ≤ 0.05).
Multivariate analysis, however, revealed alopecia to
be a significant, independent and strong predictor for
improved OS, while vomiting and weight loss were
identified as significant predictors for decreased OS.
The higher incidence of AEs related to skin reactions
and its association with the OS corroborate the findings
from earlier studies including pooled safety analyses of
sorafenib in the treatment of solid tumors, including RCC,
which have demonstrated a significant association of the
severity of the skin reactions with the time to progression
[5, 36–39]. A single-center retrospective study from Japan
suggested that sorafenib induced hand-foot skin reaction
was associated with improved best tumor response, and
PFS was a useful biomarker of clinical outcome in patients
with mRCC [40]. Although continuous dosing of sorafenib
in patients with advanced RCC was earlier suggested to
be associated with an increased incidence of diarrhea, its
prognostic significance related to survival in these patients
is lacking [20, 41]. Diarrhea was, however, suggested to
be an independent positive prognostic factor for prolonged
OS in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma treated with
sorafenib [37, 42, 43]. Our study reported a high incidence
of hypertension, mainly Grade 1 or Grade 2. This
observation was similar to a previous study that reported
a higher incidence of low-grade sorafenib-induced
hypertension in Chinese patients with advanced RCC that
was managed effectively with antihypertensive therapy,
with no reports of associated cardiac events, hypertensive
stress, dose reduction, or treatment discontinuation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This retrospective study was approved by the
institutional review board of Fudan University, Shanghai
Cancer Center, Shanghai, China. Consecutive patients
with mRCC who provided informed consent and were
treated with sorafenib were screened in the Department
of Urology, Fudan University, Shanghai Cancer Center
between April 2006 and May 2013 for inclusion in this
study. Adult patients with follow-up data available for
at least 1 year with baseline computed tomography (CT)
scans that revealed at least one measurable metastatic

were presented as proportions. The follow-up duration
was calculated using the reversed Kaplan-Meier method.
The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to evaluate the data for
normality distribution. OS and PFS were estimated using
the Kaplan-Meier method with Rothman’s 95% CI and
compared across the groups using the log-rank test. The
Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate
the prognostic value of the investigated parameters. All
p values were two-sided and were considered significant
if p value was < 0.05. The concordance index and the
proportion of 2 variance explained (R) were computed to
assess the prediction performance for survival (PFS, OS).

lesion (≥ 10 mm in greatest diameter) and at least one
follow-up CT scan after treatment assessed as per the
Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)
criteria were included for analysis. Patients who were
lost to follow-up were excluded from this study. Patient
records were retrospectively reviewed and the CT scans
were reviewed independently by a senior radiologist.

Treatment and follow-up
Patients were administered sorafenib either as first-line
or second-line treatment for mRCC. All patients received
oral sorafenib 400 mg twice daily on a continuous dosing
schedule, at an interval of 12 hours. Treatment was continued
until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Dose
reduction to 400 mg once daily was allowed for unacceptable
toxicities including Grade 3 or 4 hematological toxicity, skin
toxicity, hypertension, and/or hepatic dysfunction as defined
by the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.0 at
the discretion of the attending urologists.
Follow-ups were scheduled for all patients every
month during their treatment with sorafenib or every
3 months after the discontinuation of their treatment in
case of unacceptable toxicity. Assessments included
protocol-mandated evaluation of complete history,
physical examination, and routine laboratory tests
(complete blood count, serum electrolytes, and liver and
renal function tests). Tumor changes were assessed with
a CT scan starting at 6 weeks after the initiation of the
treatment using the best response as per the RECIST
criteria and PFS. Follow-up RECIST measurements were
ordered every 6–8 weeks during the treatment and at every
follow-up visit after the termination of the treatment.

The primary end point was OS (calculated from
the date of the first dose of sorafenib to the date of death
or last follow-up) and the secondary end point was PFS
(time from the first administration of sorafenib to the first
documentation of disease progression or death from any
cause). The safety outcome measures were incidence of
AEs from the first administration of sorafenib to the last
follow-up. Exploratory analysis included evaluation of the
effect of important prognostic factors such as age, gender,
MSKCC score, ECOG performance, previous nephrectomy,
previous systemic therapy and number of metastatic tumors
with PFS and OS, and the association of AEs with OS.
