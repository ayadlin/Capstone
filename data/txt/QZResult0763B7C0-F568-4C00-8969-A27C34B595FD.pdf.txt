Abstract
Intracellular supply of dTTP is a highly regulated process
and has been a key target for chemotherapeutic drug
development. Thymidylate kinase (TMPK) is the key enzyme
for dTTP formation in both de novo and salvage pathways. In
this study, we used lentiviral-based small hairpin RNA to
silence TMPK expression in p53(+/+) and p53( / ) HCT-116
colon cancer cells. This approach was sufficient to decrease
the dTTP pool gradually without affecting p53 expression
and generating cytotoxicity. TMPK knockdown significantly
increased doxorubicin sensitivity dramatically in p53proficient, p53-null HCT-116, and LoVo colon cancer cells.
The decrease in the dTTP pool using this approach augmented
the DNA damage response and enhanced apoptotic induction
after exposure to low-dose doxorubicin, leading to cell death.
In contrast, silencing of thymidylate synthase which blocks the
de novo pathway was incapable of sensitizing p53-null HCT-116
cells to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis because of the compensation by the salvage pathway. Our results suggest the
lentiviral delivery of small hairpin RNA targeting TMPK in
combination with a low dose of doxorubicin as a new approach
to kill colon cancer cells regardless of p53 status. [Cancer Res

Introduction
There are two major pathways controlling dTTP synthesis in
cells, a de novo and a salvage pathway. In the de novo pathway,
thymidylate synthase (TS) catalyzes the rate-limiting step of dUMP
conversion to dTMP (1). In the salvage pathway, thymidine kinase
(TK) is a key enzyme, transferring the terminal phosphate of ATP
to the 5¶-hydroxyl group of thymidine to form dTMP (2).
Subsequent phosphorylation of dTMP by thymidylate kinase
(TMPK) gives dTDP, which is then anabolized to dTTP by dNDP
kinase for DNA synthesis (1). Therefore, TMPK is a key enzyme for
dTTP formation via both the salvage and de novo pathways.
The high demand for deoxynucleotide triphosphate supply in
DNA synthesis in cancer cells makes dTTP metabolism a key
target for chemotherapeutic drug development. 5-Fluorouracil
(5-FU) and 5-fluoro-2¶-deoxyuridine have been the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agents (3). 5-FU–based treatment
inhibits cancer cell growth and initiates apoptosis by inhibiting
TS in the de novo pathway and by direct misincorporation of

fluoronucleotides into RNA and DNA (3). Multiple cellular factors
can influence the sensitivity of cancer cells to 5-FU (4, 5),
including the expression levels of genes involved in the
metabolism of 5-FU (6, 7), its targeted enzyme TS (8–10), the
genetic status of p53 (11, 12), and DNA mismatch-repair genes
(13). In particular, the loss of p53 function (due to its high
frequency of mutation) decreases the 5-FU responsiveness in
cancer cells (14, 15). Because >50% of tumors harbor p53
mutations (16), it would be important to develop a strategy that
can specifically perturb the synthesis of dTTP and damage cancer
cells regardless of the p53 status and the cellular differences in
the metabolic conversion of these anticancer agents.
TMPK is the key enzyme for catalyzing the reaction converting
dTMP to dTDP (17). Therefore, it controls dTTP synthesis from
either the de novo or salvage pathway. In this study, we used RNA
interference (RNAi) to deplete TMPK in isogenic p53(+/+) and
p53( / ) colon cancer HCT-116 cells (18). Because the lentiviral
system is a feasible approach to apply RNAi technology in
molecular therapy (19–21), we generated lentivirus expressing
TMPKshRNA to silence TMPK expression in p53 (+/+) and
p53( / ) HCT-116 cells and to examine its effect on the dTTP
pools. In addition, we assessed whether this strategy would have
therapeutic potential in combination with genotoxic agents in cell
killing.
Doxorubicin, an inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase II, has been
widely used as a chemotherapeutic agent which acts by
introducing double-strand breaks on DNA in proliferating cells
to trigger apoptosis (22). The use of doxorubicin in cancer
therapy has been limited by its cytotoxicity and the development
of cellular resistance. Lack of p53 function is also associated with
doxorubicin resistance (15). Therefore, it is more attainable to use
a lower dosage of doxorubicin in combination with the new drug
in triggering apoptosis regardless of tumor p53 status for cancer
therapy. In this study, we sought to impair the DNA repair
process by depleting dTTP, thus sensitizing cancer cells to
doxorubicin-induced death regardless of the genetic p53 status.
Our experimental results show that specific depletion of TMPK
expression decreases the dTTP pool in HCT-116 cells, rendering
colon cancer cells susceptible to doxorubicin-induced death.

Targeting TMPK for Doxorubicin Sensitization
Dharmacon siGenome SMART pools and Lipofectamine 2000 was from
Invitrogen. Dialyzed serum was purchased from Life Technologies.
Cell culture. HCT-116 p53(+/+) and p53( / ) cells were kindly
provided by Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD; ref. 18). HCT-116 cells were cultured at 37jC in a
humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere in McCoy’s 5A medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum, and LoVo cells were maintained in F12K
medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum. 293FT cells were cultured
at 37jC in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere in DMEM with 10% fetal
bovine serum.
Construction of lentiviral vector. Using the BLOCK-iT Lentiviral RNAi
Expression System (Invitrogen), we constructed a lentiviral-based small
hairpin RNA (shRNA). Nucleotides 509 to 527 of hTMPK open reading
frame and nucleotides 1017 to 1036 in the 3¶-untranslated region of the
hTS gene were chosen as the target sequence, and the random sequences
derived from hTMPK and hTS were scrambled. We synthesized one strand
of oligonucleotide containing the target sequence followed by a
7-nucleotide short loop and sequence that was the reverse complement
of the initial target sequence. The oligonucleotides in pairs were annealed
and inserted into pENTR/U6 RNAi cassette to generate an entry construct.
The lentiviral constructs were then individually cloned by recombination
of the U6 RNAi cassette into the pLenti6/BLOCK-iT-DEST vector.
Lentiviral shRNA production for infection. 293FT producer cells
(6  106 cells) were cotransfected with the ViraPower packaging Mix
(containing a mixture of the pLP1, pLP2, and pLP/VSVG plasmid) and
pLenti6 scrambleshRNA, TMPKshRNA, or TSshRNA plasmid by Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen). At 72 h after transfection, supernatants containing
lentivirus were collected and concentrated. The titer of lentivirus was
determined by transducing HCT-116 cells with the virus stock at serial
dilution for colony formation in culture medium containing blasticidin
(5 Ag/mL). The lentiviral scrambleshRNA, TMPKshRNA, and TSshRNA stocks in
1 mL of medium containing 8 Ag/mL of polybrene were used to infect
2.5  105 cells with a multiplicity of infection of 18, 17.2, and 20, respectively,
for 6 h, after which the supernatants were replaced with complete medium
for the subsequent assays.
TK1 siRNA transfection. After 1 day of lentiviral scrambleshRNA or
TSshRNA infection, cells were transfected with or without 100 pmol of hTK1
siRNA with Lipofectamine 2000 for 6 h.
MTS cytotoxicity assay. After 48 h of lentiviral shRNA infection, 4  103
cells per well were seeded onto 96-well plates and allowed to grow for
24 h prior to doxorubicin treatment for a further 24 h. Cell viability was then
measured by MTS assay (Promega; ref. 25).
Doxorubicin uptake measurement. The cellular uptake of doxorubicin
was quantified by measuring the fluorescence intensity using a spectrofluorometer. After lentiviral scrambleshRNA or TMPKshRNA infection for 48 h,
3  105 cells were seeded on six-well plates overnight then treated with
doxorubicin at different concentrations for 1 h. Cells were then trypsinized
and lysed in 50 AL of 0.4% SDS followed by the addition of 1 mL of butanol
and centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatants were
subjected to fluorescence measurement using a spectrofluorometer at
wavelengths of 470 nm (excitation) and 590 nm (emission).
Whole-cell dTTP pool extraction and pool size determination. Cells
(1  106) were washed twice with 1 mL of cold PBS and extracted with 1 mL
of ice-cold 60% methanol at 20jC overnight, followed by centrifugation for
30 min at 16,000  g. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and
dried under vacuum. The residue was dissolved in sterile water and stored
at 20jC for dTTP measurement based on the method of Sherman and
Fyfe (26).

Apoptosis analysis. An Annexin V-FITC apoptosis kit (Oncogene
Research Products) was used to detect apoptosis. Cells were trypsinized
and suspended in PBS at f1  106 cells/mL prior to staining with Annexin
V-FITC for fluorescence microscopy.
Colony formation assay. Cells were seeded at 4,000 cells/100 mm dish.
After treatment, cells were washed with PBS and refreshed with growth
medium. After culture for 14 days, surviving colonies were fixed with 100%
ice-cold methanol, stained by crystal violet for counting.
Immunostaining of ;H2AX foci. Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min then blocked with 5.5% goat serum for 1 h. Following
blocking, cells were stained with anti-gH2AX antibody (1:500) for 2 h at
room temperature then stained with anti-mouse TRITC antibody (1:100)
and 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 1 h. After mounting overnight,
gH2AX foci were observed by fluorescent microscopy.

Results
Silencing of TMPK decreases the dTTP pool in p53(+/+) and
p53( / ) HCT-116 cells. p53(+/+) and p53( / ) HCT-116 cells
were infected by lentivirus expressing TMPK and scrambled
shRNA, and the expression levels of TMPK, TK1, TS, and dTTP
pool and cell growth were determined in each day after infection.
In both cell lines, the level of TMPK was significantly decreased
after 1 day of TMPKshRNA lentiviral infection with a persistent
silencing effect for 3 days without changing the expression level of
TK1, TS, and p53 (Fig. 1A). In parallel samples, we found that the
steady state level of dTTP was gradually reduced and reached 50%
reduction after TMPK silencing for 3 days (Fig. 1B), demonstrating
the essential role of TMPK in dTTP formation. TMPK knockdown
reduced the cell growth rate of p53(+/+) cells more prominent than
that of p53( / ) cells (Fig. 1C). Because the basal level of dTTP
pool was much higher in p53( / ) HCT-116 cells, it is possible
that the decrease of dTTP pool by silencing of TMPK in p53-null
cells did not reach a range that would severely affect DNA
replication for cell proliferation.
We further examined the effect of TMPK depletion on cell cycle
distribution. After lentiviral infection for 3 days, p53(+/+) and
p53( / ) HCT-116 cells were subjected to flow cytometric analysis.
There were 2-fold more S phase cells in p53( / ) cells than in
p53(+/+) cells, which was well correlated with the difference in
dTTP pool size. TMPK knockdown caused an 8% and 11% increase
of G0/G1 cells with a corresponding decrease in G2-M fraction in
p53(+/+) and p53( / ) cells, respectively (Fig. 1D), indicating that
the G1-S progression was affected by the decrease of dTTP level.
Because we did not detect the sub-G1 population, the growth
retardation in cells depleted of TMPK was unlikely to be due to
cytotoxicity.
Sensitization of HCT-116 cells to doxorubicin by TMPK
depletion in colon cancer cells. These infected and control cells
were then treated with doxorubicin at various concentrations, from
0.001 to 10 Amol/L for 24 hours, and cell viability was measured.
The IC50 of doxorubicin was f6.9 and 8.8 Amol/L in scrambled
shRNA-infected p53(+/+) and p53( / ) HCT-116 cells, respectively. Infection with virus expressing TMPKshRNA dramatically

HCT-116 cells were infected with lentiviral TMPKshRNA or scrambleshRNA (SC ) for 6 h. Following lentiviral shRNA infection at 0, 1, 2, and 3 days, cells were
subjected to (A ) Western blot analysis with anti-p53, hTS, hTK1, hTMPK, and h-tubulin antibodies, and (B ) dTTP pool size measurement (columns, mean of three

was plated into a 96-well plate at 1  103 cells per well. Following overnight culture, the growth of the infected cells at each day was measured by MTS assay
(points, mean of four to six experiments; bars, SE; P value calculated using a two-tailed Student’s t test). Left, p53(+/+) HCT-116 cells; right, p53 ( / )

Targeting TMPK for Doxorubicin Sensitization

decreased the doxorubicin IC50 to 0.7 and 0.5 Amol/L in p53(+/+)
and p53( / ) cells, respectively (Fig. 2A). Because TMPK
depletion did not change doxorubicin transport in cells at various
dosages of doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 2B), the significant increase
of doxorubicin sensitivity by TMPK depletion was not due to more
doxorubicin uptake in both p53-proficient and p53-null colon
cancer cells. Clonogenicity assays were also performed in cells
infected with or without lentivirus delivering shRNA against TMPK
with exposure to 0.5 Amol/L of doxorubicin for 24 hours. After
refreshment with drug-free growth medium, the ability of p53proficient and p53-null cells with TMPK knockdown alone
exhibited 20% to 30% reduction of the colony formation efficiency,
whereas exposure to 0.5 Amol/L of doxorubicin alone suppressed
the clonogenicity of p53-proficient but not p53-null cells (Fig. 2C).
TMPK knockdown in combination with doxorubicin treatment
drastically reduced the number of surviving colonies in both cell
lines. Clearly, TMPK depletion significantly enhances the cell killing
effect by low-dose doxorubicin exposure. Of note, a 3-fold
difference in colony formation was still seen in the p53-proficient
and p53-null cells depleted of TMPK with doxorubicin treatment,
suggesting the contribution of p53 in suppressing cell survival.
Silencing of TMPK also increased doxorubicin sensitivity f8-fold
in another human colon cancer cell line, LoVo (Fig. 2D). Thus,
lentivirus expressing TMPKshRNA should be considered as a
chemosensitizer for doxorubicin in killing colon cancer cells.
Amplification of doxorubicin-induced DNA damage
response by TMPK depletion. We then investigated whether the
decrease in the dTTP pool by TMPK knockdown augments DNA
damage response induced by doxorubicin by examining histone
gH2AX foci formation, which is a marker for persistent DNA
damage due to double-strand breaks (27, 28). Treatment with lowdose doxorubicin (0.5 Amol/L) was unable to clearly cause gH2AX
foci formation in p53(+/+) cells and p53( / ) cells (Fig. 3A). With
TMPK shRNA viral infection, both p53(+/+) and p53( / ) cells
displayed strong gH2AX foci after treatment with low-dose
doxorubicin. Because TMPK depletion by itself did not induce
gH2AX foci formation in these cells (Fig. 3A), these results suggest
that TMPK depletion is able to intensify DNA damage lesions
induced by doxorubicin. The Western blot analysis further showed
specific induction of p53 by doxorubicin treatment, and the extent
of p53 induction was further increased in cells with TMPKshRNA
virus infection (Fig. 3B). Apparently, dTTP reduction enhances p53
induction in response to DNA double-strand break damage.
Consistent with p53 induction, p21 expression was increased by
doxorubicin treatment; however, TMPK knockdown did not further
promote the extent of p21 induction, probably because apoptosis,
instead of cell cycle arrest, predominates in p53(+/+) cells depleted
of TMPK. In p53-null cells, TMPK knockdown markedly enhanced
doxorubicin-induced ATM activation in contrast to the moderate

amount of phosphorylated ATM detected in p53-proficient cells,
indicating that a reduction in the dTTP pool enables p53-null cells
to synergize with doxorubicin-induced DNA damage in the
activation of the ATM checkpoint pathway.
To know whether there is an increase of dTTP synthesis to
coordinate with DNA repair after DNA damage, HCT-116 p53(+/+)
and p53( / )cells were treated with doxorubicin for 24 hours and
harvested for dTTP pool determination (Fig. 3C). It turned out that
the dTTP level in p53-null cells was increased 3-fold to 3.5-fold after
doxorubicin treatment as compared with a moderate 1.6-fold to
2.6-fold increase in p53-proficient cells. These results not only show
the increase of dTTP level being associated with DNA damage
response but also suggest that the cellular p53 context affects the
magnitude of dTTP synthesis in response to doxorubicin treatment.
Lack of doxorubicin sensitization effect by TS knockdown in
p53-null cells. It has been shown that silencing TS expression by
small double-stranded RNAs in combination with TS inhibitor
compounds was able to increase cell killing in a RKO variant
expressing high levels of TS (29). In this study, we also tested the
effect of TS depletion on doxorubicin sensitization by generating
lentivirus expressing TSshRNA for infecting p53(+/+) and p53( / )
HCT-116 cells. Three days after infection, cells were harvested for
Western blot analysis. Expression of TSshRNA specifically depleted
TS protein in both cell lines (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, we found that
TS depletion resulted in the elevation of TK1 expression in both
cell lines and a concomitant increase of p53 level in p53(+/+) cells.
We then treated these cells with doxorubicin at a concentration
range of 0.001 to 10 Amol/L. The IC50 of doxorubicin was 6.79 and
2.13 Amol/L for p53(+/+) HCT-116 cells infected by lentiviral
scrambleshRNA and TSshRNA, respectively. As for p53( / ) cells, TS
depletion had no effect on doxorubicin sensitivity (Fig. 4B). Thus,
unlike TMPK knockdown, the increased susceptibility of HCT-116
cells to doxorubicin following TS depletion requires the participation of p53.
Differential effects of TMPK and TS depletion on apoptotic
induction after low-dose doxorubicin treatment in p53-null
cells. We further compared the effect of TS and TMPK knockdown
on doxorubicin-induced apoptosis by FITC-labeled Annexin V
staining. It seems that low-dose doxorubicin or TMPK knockdown
alone had no effect on apoptotic induction (Fig. 5A). Depletion of
TMPK followed by doxorubicin treatment resulted in essentially all
p53-null and p53-proficient cells becoming Annexin V–positive, an
indication of extensive apoptosis (Fig. 5A). In contrast, TS
knockdown caused p53(+/+) but not p53( / ) HCT-116 cells to
undergo apoptosis following 1 Amol/L of doxorubicin treatment
(Fig. 5B). In conclusion, the combination treatment of low-dose
doxorubicin with TMPK depletion was more effective than with TS
knockdown in inducing the apoptosis of colon cancer cells
deficient of p53.

delivering TMPKshRNA or scrambleshRNA as described in the legend to Fig. 1 were collected at 48 h, and were plated into a 96-well plate at 4  103 cells per well.
Following overnight culture, cells were treated with various concentrations of doxorubicin as indicated for 24 h, and cell viability were measured by MTS assay
(points, mean of four to six experiments; bars, SE). B, after infection for 48 h, cells were plated at 3  105 cells/well and treated with doxorubicin at the concentrations
indicated. After 1 h, cells were harvested to measure doxorubicin uptake (columns, mean of six experiments; bars, SE). C, cells post-infected for 72 h were
seeded in 100-mm dishes at 4,000 cells/dish. Following treatment with or without 0.5 Amol/L of doxorubicin for 24 h, cells were washed with PBS and refreshed
with growth medium. After 14 days of culture, surviving colonies were fixed, stained by crystal violet, and counted (columns, mean of three independent
experiments; bars, SE; *, P = 0.03; **, P < 0.001; ***, P < 0.0001 based on a two-tailed Student’s t test). D, LoVo cells were infected without or with lentiviruses
delivering TMPKshRNA or scrambleshRNA (SC ) and were split into two pools. One pool, after transfection for 72 h, was used for Western blot analysis with anti-p53,
hTMPK, and h-tubulin antibodies. Another pool of cells was plated into a 96-well plate at 4  103 cells per well for the determination of doxorubicin sensitivity as
described (points, mean of six experiments; bars, SE).

Contribution of the salvage pathway in compromising TS
knockdown. Notably, TK1 protein expression level was elevated in
cells depleted of TS and the steady-state level of dTTP was
significantly increased after doxorubicin treatment. Therefore, one
possible explanation for p53-null cells irresponsive to TS knockdown in doxorubicin sensitization is that dTTP synthesis via the
salvage pathway might be able to compensate for the loss of
de novo synthesis. To verify this speculation, we then depleted both
TS and TK1 in p53-null cells followed by doxorubicin sensitivity

measurement. Concordant with the results observed in silencing of
TMPK, simultaneous knockdown of TK1 and TS was able to
sensitize p53-null cells to doxorubicin-induced death (Fig. 6A).
Furthermore, to substantiate the role of the salvage pathway, we
used dialyzed serum to deprive exogenous thymidine supply and
incubated cells depleted of TS for doxorubicin treatment. As a
comparison, a parallel set of cells were treated with doxorubicin in
the dialyzed-serum medium containing 10 Amol/L of thymidine.
We found that TS knockdown decreased the doxorubicin IC50

from 9.1 to 1.3 Amol/L in p53( / ) cells in medium containing
dialyzed serum, whereas the presence of thymidine abolished the
doxorubicin sensitization by TS depletion (Fig. 6B). Clearly, dTTP
synthesis via the thymidine-dependent salvage pathway contributes to the insensitivity of p53-null cells to TS depletion with
doxorubicin treatment.

Discussion
De novo synthesis of dTTP has been an important targeted
pathway for chemotherapy. Because intracellular synthesis of
dTTP is also dependent on the salvage pathway, in this study,
we disrupted both de novo and salvage pathways in dTTP supply
simultaneously by depleting the expression of TMPK using
lentiviral delivery of shRNA targeting TMPK. Our results showed
that this approach effectively decreased the dTTP pools in
p53(+/+) and p53( / ) HCT-116 cells without inducing cytotoxicity. With exposure to genotoxic agent doxorubicin, we found
that TMPK knockdown was capable of sensitizing p53-null and
p53-proficient HCT-116 cells to doxorubicin killing. Because p53
is not functional in 50% of tumors (16), and drug resistance to

chemotherapy has been largely attributed to the status of p53
(15), our data suggest that lentiviral-based shRNA targeting
TMPK has the potential to improve the chemotherapeutic
efficacy of low-dose doxorubicin treatment for colon cancer
cells regardless of the p53 status.
In this study, we also tested the effect of TS depletion on
sensitizing HCT-116 cells to doxorubicin. Although TS knockdown
increased doxorubicin sensitivity f3-fold in p53(+/+) cells, the
sensitization effect was much less than TMPK depletion. In
particular, it was noted that knockdown of TS but not of TMPK
by itself already increased the p53 level. This result is related to
the previous findings showing that p53 is induced upon inhibiting
TS by 5-FU or antifolate treatment due to the misincorporation of
dUTP into DNA (30). Considering the alteration in expression
levels of TK1 and p53, the molecular effect of TS knockdown
seems to be quite distinct from that of TMPK depletion. The
difference is probably because the TS knockdown, like 5-FU
treatment, leads to an increase of dUTP formation which in turn
generates a DNA damage signal (31), whereas TMPK depletion
might simply result in dTMP accumulation and a decrease in the
dTTP supply. In this report, we did not assess the effect of TS

hTS, hTK1, hTMPK, and h-tubulin antibodies. B, a proportion
of cells after lentiviral TSshRNA or scrambleshRNA infection and
without infection was collected for doxorubicin sensitivity
determination as described in the legend to Fig. 2.

Figure 5. Differential effects of TMPK and TS depletion on doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in p53-null cells. FITC-labeled Annexin V apoptosis assay. p53 (+/+) and
p53 ( / ) HCT-116 cells were infected with or without lentiviral TMPKshRNA for 72 h, treated with 0.5 Amol/L of doxorubicin for 24 h (A ), or infected with or without

depletion on the cellular dTTP and dUTP levels because our assay
method for dTTP measurement was unable to distinguish dUTP
from dTTP. Therefore, it remains to be determined whether
sensitization of p53(+/+) HCT-116 cells to doxorubicin by
silencing of TS is accomplished due to a decrease of the dTTP
pool or due to dUTP-mediated DNA damage effect.
Very interestingly, we observed that up-regulation of TK1 was
associated with TS knockdown in p53(+/+) and p53( / ) HCT-116
cells. In contrast with p53(+/+) cells, TS depletion in p53( / )

cells had no effect on increasing doxorubicin sensitivity. In this
study, we showed that simultaneous silencing of TK1 and TS
significantly increased doxorubicin sensitivity in p53-null cells.
Moreover, TS knockdown was also able to sensitize p53-null cells to
doxorubicin in dialyzed-serum medium devoid of exogenous
thymidine. These data suggest that TS depletion up-regulates the
expression of TK1 in the salvage pathway to provide sufficient
dTTP in p53-null cells, thereby allowing these cells the capability to
repair DNA for survival during doxorubicin treatment.

Targeting TMPK for Doxorubicin Sensitization

Consistent with the role of TMPK in catalyzing the merging
reaction from the salvage and de novo pathways for dTTP
formation, we showed that dTTP reduction was effectively achieved
by silencing TMPK in HCT-116 cells. Unlike TS knockdown,
silencing of TMPK did not significantly increase the p53 level, even
though the pool size of dTTP was reduced to half. Therefore, the
reduction of dTTP pool by itself was insufficient to induce DNA
damage response. In response to DNA double-strand breaks, cells
activate the ATM pathway to arrest the cell cycle and initiate the
repair process (32–34). In p53-null cells, the extent of ATM
phosphorylation induced by doxorubicin exposure was markedly
increased by the silencing of TMPK, indicating that the change in
the dTTP pool amplifies the signal for ATM-mediated checkpoint
pathways. As for p53(+/+) cells, silencing of TMPK increased the
magnitude of p53 expression induced by doxorubicin treatment

with a rather moderate increase in ATM activation. It is not yet clear
whether the difference of the cell cycle distribution in p53-proficient
and p53-null cells contributes to the differential effect of dTTP
reduction on the extent of doxorubicin-induced ATM activation.
Despite these molecular differences in response to TMPK depletion
in combination with low-dose doxorubicin treatment, p53(+/+) and
p53( / ) HCT-116 cells all displayed intensified DNA damage
lesions, as shown by a marked increase of gH2AX staining, and
underwent apoptosis. At present, it is reasonable to assume that the
decrease in the cellular dTTP pool might impair the repair process
necessary for cell survival, thereby severing the extent of DNA
damage and triggering apoptotic activation through the p53dependent and p53-independent pathways.
Because TMPK knockdown was unable to sensitize normal IMR90 fibroblasts to doxorubicin (data not shown), it is likely that

p53 ( / ) HCT-116 cells were infected with or without
lentiviral TSshRNA. A, after infection for 24 h, cells were
transfected with or without hTK1 siRNA for another
24 h and were used for doxorubicin sensitivity
determination as described in the legend to Fig. 2.
B, infected cells were incubated in medium containing
10% dialyzed serum in the presence or absence of
10 Amol/L of thymidine for 48 h and used for doxorubicin
sensitivity determination.

cancer cells with high proliferative rates are more susceptible to
the synthetic lethality of TMPK depletion and low doses of
doxorubicin. In conclusion, our study data showed several
advantages of using lentiviral shRNA targeting TMPK in combination with doxorubicin in cancer treatment. First, it has a low
cytotoxicity toward normal cells. Second, it activates apoptosis
effectively in cancer cells regardless of the p53 status. Third, this
approach has a therapeutic potential in treating colon cancer cells
that are resistant to 5-FU due to a variety of cellular factors that
affect the metabolism of 5-FU.
