Abstract
Chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity is a significant problem associated with successful treatment of many
cancers. Tubulin is a well-established target of antineoplastic therapy; however, tubulin-targeting agents, such as
paclitaxel and the newer epothilones, induce significant neurotoxicity. Eribulin mesylate, a novel microtubuletargeting analogue of the marine natural product halichondrin B, has recently shown antineoplastic activity,
with relatively low incidence and severity of neuropathy, in metastatic breast cancer patients. The mechanism of
chemotherapy-induced neuropathy is not well understood. One of the main underlying reasons is incomplete
characterization of pathology of peripheral nerves from treated subjects, either from patients or preclinically
from animals. The current study was conducted to directly compare, in mice, the neuropathy-inducing
propensity of three drugs: paclitaxel, ixabepilone, and eribulin mesylate. Because these drugs have different
potencies and pharmacokinetics, we compared them on the basis of a maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Effects of
each drug on caudal and digital nerve conduction velocity, nerve amplitude, and sciatic nerve and dorsal root
ganglion morphology at 0.25  MTD, 0.5  MTD, 0.75  MTD, and MTD were compared. Paclitaxel and
ixabepilone, at their respective MTDs, produced significant deficits in caudal nerve conduction velocity, caudal
amplitude and digital nerve amplitudes, as well as moderate to severe degenerative pathologic changes in dorsal
root ganglia and sciatic nerve. In contrast, eribulin mesylate produced no significant deleterious effects on any
nerve conduction parameter measured and caused milder, less frequent effects on morphology. Overall, our
findings indicate that eribulin mesylate induces less neuropathy in mice than paclitaxel or ixabepilone at
equivalent MTD-based doses. Cancer Res; 71(11); 3952â€“62. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Peripheral neuropathy is a common dose-limiting toxicity
of many chemotherapeutic regimens. Chemotherapy-induced
peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) causes numerous debilitating
symptoms, impairs functional capacity, and results in dose
reductions or possible cessation of chemotherapy. As a consequence, effective chemotherapeutic regimens with a lower
propensity to induce neuropathy would be favored.

Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related
death among women in the Unites States. Many patients
progress from early-stage breast cancer to metastatic disease
within short periods of time. Although several chemotherapeutic agents exist for metastatic disease, the overall prognosis
remains poor, with the 5-year survival rate approximating to
only 23% (1).
Paclitaxel is often administered as first-line therapy in
breast cancer patients with metastatic disease, achieving
overall response rates in the range of 30% to 60%, or 20%
to 40% when used as second-line or salvage therapy (2).
Taxanes are among the most effective antineoplastic agents
against many cancers, but their side effect of peripheral
neurotoxicity has limited their use (3, 4). Chronic neuropathic
pain affects between 20% and 50% of women after their breast
cancer treatment (5). Another chemotherapeutic agent administered to metastatic breast cancer patients whose cancer is
resistant or no longer responding to paclitaxel is the recently
approved ixabepilone, which is a semisynthetic analogue of
epothilone B with antineoplastic activity against taxane-resistant cell lines (6â€“8). Although ixabepilone may be useful for
the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer,
it induces neuropathy in up to 72% of patients (9). Both
ixabepilone and paclitaxel are microtubule-stabilizing agents
that promote polymerization of microtubules (10). However,

Neuropathy Induced by Eribulin, Paclitaxel, and Ixabepilone

the precise mechanisms of paclitaxel- and ixabepiloneinduced neurotoxicities are not yet completely understood
(11â€“13). One of the reasons for this is the incomplete characterization of function and pathology of peripheral nerves in
chemotherapy-treated subjects, either from patients or preclinically from animals. Further studies in this area are, thus,
warranted.
Eribulin mesylate (previously E7389), another promising
microtubule-targeting agent, is currently undergoing Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) fast-track review. Recently,
positive results from randomized phase II and III trials of
eribulin mesylate in patients with advanced metastatic breast
cancer have been reported (14, 15). Eribulin mesylate is a
structurally simplified, macrocyclic, ketone analogue of halichondrin B, and it inhibits microtubule dynamics through a
novel mechanism relative to other tubulin-targeting agents,
including the taxanes, Vinca alkaloids, and epothilones. It
binds with high affinity and specificity to positively charged
ends of microtubules, thereby suppressing microtubule
dynamics (16). Preclinically, eribulin mesylate has shown
potent anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo (17). Preliminary
reports from clinical observations of therapy with eribulin
mesylate suggest that, at efficacious exposures, there is relatively low incidence and severity of neuropathy (18). Based on
this finding, preclinical studies were conducted to directly
compare maximum tolerated dose (MTD) regimens (and
equivalent fractions thereof) of paclitaxel, eribulin mesylate,
and ixabepilone for neuropathy induction in mice, which was
evaluated by parameters including nerve conduction velocity
(NCV), amplitude, and sciatic nerve and dorsal root ganglia
(DRG) morphologic endpoints. In this article, we describe our
findings from this study.

Materials and Methods
Test materials
The following chemicals were used in this study: eribulin
mesylate (synthesized at Eisai Research Institute, Andover,
MA) was stored at 80 C in the dark. Paclitaxel (C47H51NO14)
was purchased from LC Laboratories and stored at 20 C in
the dark until required for use. Ixabepilone (C27H42N2O5S) was
purchased from Myoderm Medical and stored at 4 C in the
dark.
Formulations
Eribulin mesylate was dissolved in 100% anhydrous
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich; catalogue no.
D2650) to produce a 10-mg/mL stock solution, which was
separated into aliquots and stored in the dark at 80 C until
the day of administration. On each day of administration, the
stock solution was thawed and diluted with saline to a final
concentration of 0.25 mg/mL in 2.5% DMSO/97.5% saline to
yield dosing solutions in a 10-mL/kg volume.
Paclitaxel was dissolved in ethanol (100%) at 10% of the final
desired volume and vortexed for 2 to 3 minutes. An equal
volume of cremophor (10% of final volume) was then added
and the mixture was re-vortexed for about 10 minutes. Immediately prior to injection, ice-cold saline was added to make up

www.aacrjournals.org

a final volume (as 80% of final) and the solution was maintained on ice during dosing. Dosing solutions were made
freshly every day and dosed in an administration volume of
10 mL/kg.
Ixabepilone was purchased as part of an IXEMPRA kit
(Bristol-Myers Squibb) for clinical administration. The ixabepilone solution was prepared according to instructions provided in the package insert. Basically, the kit consists of 2 vials,
1 containing 47 mg ixabepilone powder and the other containing 23.5 mL diluent, which were stored in the refrigerator at
4 C. The total volume of the diluent was added to the total
amount of powder; therefore, after reconstitution, the concentration of ixabepilone in the solution was 2 mg/mL. [The
diluent supplied consists of a sterile nonpyrogenic solution of
52.8% (w/v) purified polyoxyethylated castor oil and 39.8%
(w/v) dehydrated alcohol.] The formulated ixabepilone stock
solution (2 mg/mL) was immediately aliquoted and stored at
80 C until use. On each experimental day, the stock solution
was diluted by adding 50% ethanol/50% cremophor with
subsequent vortexing to yield a resultant solution that
was 5 times the required dosing concentration. Finally,
4 volumes of PBS were added, while vortexing, to achieve
a final dosing concentration of 10 mL/kg.
Animals
Female BALB/c mice (approximately 7â€“8 weeks of age at
onset of dosing) were used for all experiments. Mice were
obtained from the Harlan Laboratories Inc. and maintained
with ad libitum access to water and a standardized synthetic
diet (Harlan Teklab), both before and during the course of the
study.
Animal housing and procedure
Room temperature and humidity were maintained at 20 
2 C and 55  10%, respectively. Artificial lighting provided a
12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle (light 7 AMâ€“7 PM). All
experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of Eisai, Baltimore, MD, and
conformed to all of the applicable institutional and governmental guidelines for the humane treatment of laboratory
animals.
MTD determination
For each experimental compound, an MTD on a (Q2D  3)
 2 weeks schedule (every other day for 3 injections with a 2day rest between weekly cycles for a total of 6 injections) was
determined using groups of 10 mice each. MTD was defined as
the highest dose level at which no more than 10% deaths
occurred and/or at which no mice displayed more than 20%
individual weight loss and/or overt clinical signs of distress
and/or inability to eat and drink, thus requiring euthanasia.
Doses chosen for the MTD studies were based on antitumor
activity and/or neuropathy-inducing doses in mice as previously described (12, 17, 19, 20). Doses used for eribulin
mesylate were 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, and 1.75 mg/kg per dose
administration. Doses used for paclitaxel were 20, 25, 30, 35,
40, and 45 mg/kg per dose administration. Doses used for
ixabepilone were 2.0, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0 mg/kg per

dose administration. All injections were administered into the
caudal vein at a volume of 10 mL/kg.
Mice were weighed 3 times a week during the 2-week
treatment period and for 2 weeks following completion of
dosing. day 1 refers to the first administration of experimental
compound or vehicle. day 12 refers to the day when all 6 doses
of chemotherapeutic/vehicle had been administered. day 26
refers to the final experimental day (2 weeks after completion
of dosing). Clinical signs and survival were monitored daily.
NCV and amplitude measurement
Baseline NCV was measured 1 week prior to initiation of
dosing in 50 mice. Mice were subsequently randomized into 5
treatment groups such that mean digital NCVs (as well as all
other parameters) for each group of 10 mice were equivalent.
Each group then received vehicle or chemotherapy (at MTD,
0.75  MTD, 0.5  MTD, or 0.25  MTD) on a (Q2D  3) 
2 week schedule. Posttreatment nerve conduction measurements were made 24 hours after last chemotherapy dose.
During all recording sessions, mice were anesthetized with
2% isoflurane (by inhalation, for induction and maintenance)
and placed in a prone position. Throughout testing, animals
were positioned on a warm heating pad with rectal temperature monitored and maintained between 37.0 C and 41.0 C.
Platinum subdermal needle electrodes (Grass Technologies)
were used for both recording and stimulation. NCV and the
peak compound action potential amplitude were assessed in
both caudal and digital nerves. Caudal and digital NCVs were
recorded orthodromically from recording sites at the proximal
tail and the lateral malleolus, respectively. Supramaximal
stimulation was achieved using a constant-voltage squarewave pulse (0.02- to 0.05-millisecond duration) isolated from
ground and produced by the MP100 (BIOPAC Systems Inc.).
Each nerve segment stimulation was repeated for at least 3
times, up to a maximum of 6 times, with increasing voltage
until the maximal response had been achieved, as evidenced
by no further increase or a reduction in amplitude in spite of
increase in voltage. Neuroelectric signals were impedance
matched and differentially amplified with a gain of 20,000
and a frequency band of 20 to 3 kHz using a BIOPAC MP100
and AcqKnowledge software version 3.7.3 (BIOPAC Systems
Inc.). Latencies were scored from stimulus onset, and amplitudes from baseline, using computer cursors. Latency measurements were scored to the nearest 0.01 milliseconds, and
amplitude measurements were scored to the nearest 0.01 mV.
Differences in measurements across groups were determined by direct statistical comparisons (ANOVA, followed
by Tukey's post hoc comparisons; Prism Graphpad Software,
version 4.03) of the amplitude and conduction velocity data.
Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05.
Caudal NCV was recorded from electrodes in a bipolar
configuration at the base of the tail (at the hairline); the
stimulating cathode was positioned 35 mm further distally.
Digital NCV was recorded using stimulation at the base of the
second toe and recording at the level of the lateral malleolus.
The distance traveled was measured for each mouse and, in
general, was between 9 and 14 mm. The response latency at
supramaximal stimulation divided by the distance between

3954

Cancer Res; 71(11) June 1, 2011

the electrodes used for recording and stimulating provides a
measure of the conduction velocity in the nerve segment
under investigation. Amplitudes measure the baseline-to-peak
amplitude of the neural response.
Sciatic nerve and DRG histology
Immediately after recording of final nerve conduction
parameters, 5 randomly selected mice from each group were
chosen for nerve/DRG excision. Sciatic nerve segments were
dissected from the region immediately before the trifurcation
of the sciatic nerve (into the common peroneal, tibial, and
sural branches); L4 and L5 DRG were dissected from the spinal
cord. Samples were then fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde and 4%
paraformaldehyde/2% glutaraldehyde, respectively. Samples
were processed and resin-embedded according to previously
published protocols (21â€“24) and used for light microscopic
determinations. After embedding, samples were cut in 1-mm
semi-thin sections with a microtome RM2265 (Leica Microsystems GmbH), and sections were stained with toluidine blue
for light microscopic examination under a Nikon Eclipse E200
light microscope (Nikon). Section codes were masked before
examination such that 2 independent examiners were unaware of the treatment administered to the examined animal.

Results
Eribulin mesylate
As expected in this MTD-finding experiment, mice treated
with 1.5 and 1.75 mg/kg eribulin mesylate on a (Q2D  3)  2week schedule displayed significant body weight losses averaging between 14% and 17% (Fig. 1A) as well as clinical signs
characterized by piloerection, general unkempt condition, and
decreased motor activities. Average weight losses in groups
treated with eribulin mesylate at doses 1.25 mg/kg or less were
minimal (<10%), and mice in these groups displayed no overt
clinical signs. Weight lost was completely recovered following
cessation of dosing. The MTD of eribulin mesylate was determined to be 1.75 mg/kg when administered according to this
regimen, with an average group weight loss of 17%.
After 2 weeks of dosing with eribulin mesylate, there were
no observed deficits in either caudal or digital NCV or
amplitude (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, dosing eribulin mesylate at
MTD (1.75 mg/kg) produced a significant increase in caudal
amplitude compared with the control, and a similar trend was
noted for 0.75  MTD (1.31 mg/kg). A possible explanation for
this paradoxical finding may be dehydration of the tail in these
high-dose groups. Because the amplitude of the response to
nerve stimulation is a measure of the density of the responding fibers, decreased tissue volume secondary to dehydration
may present as an artifactual increase in amplitude. However,
as high-dose paclitaxel- and ixabepilone-treated mice also
exhibited similar weight loss without accompanying augmentation of caudal amplitude, this may not be the only explanation of this finding. The underlying reason for this observation
will require further study.
A dose-dependent effect on sciatic nerve morphology was
evident with 0.5  MTD (0.875 mg/kg) to MTD (1.75 mg/kg)
doses of eribulin mesylate. At these doses, eribulin mesylate

caused severe pathologic changes consistent with axonal
degeneration (Fig. 5C). Axonal degeneration seemed to affect
both large- and small-diameter fibers, and no regenerative
figures (e.g., thin myelinated fibers) were present. The
severity of axonopathy was milder but still clearly evident

their cytoplasm appeared much darker than normal neurons
(Fig. 6C). Dose-dependent axonal degeneration was present
in the proximal axons at 0.5  MTD and greater (Fig. 6C;
Supplementary Fig. 2S).
Ixabepilone
All mice receiving ixabepilone doses greater than 3.0 mg/kg
on a (Q2D  3)  2-week schedule suffered appreciable weight
loss (more than 20% of original weight) and displayed overt
clinical signs of nonâ€“well-being (including piloerection and
unkempt coats); these animals were euthanized before the end
of the planned doses. Moderate weight losses (between 11%
and 15%) were observed in the middle-dose groups (2.75 and
3.0 mg/kg ixabepilone), which reversed during the 14-day
recovery/observation period after cessation of dosing. In
contrast, 2.5 mg/kg or lower dose of ixabepilone caused
minimal weight loss (10%), no overt clinical signs, and
was well tolerated by mice. Minimal clinical signs were
observed in the 2.75- and 3.0-mg/kg dose groups. The MTD
of ixapebilone on a (Q2D  3)  2-week schedule was
determined to be 3 mg/kg (Fig. 1C).
After 2 weeks of dosing with ixabepilone, a clear doseâ€“
response for decreasing caudal NCV and amplitude was
evident (Fig. 4A and B). Doses of 0.5  MTD to MTD (1.5â€“

www.aacrjournals.org

3 mg/kg) caused significant reductions in caudal NCV,
whereas doses of 0.75  MTD to MTD (2.25â€“3 mg/kg) caused
significant reduction in caudal amplitude. At MTD (3.0 mg/
kg), ixabepilone significantly reduced both digital NCV and
amplitude (Fig. 4C and D).
Ixabepilone at doses below the MTD (0.75â€“2.25 mg/kg)
generally had minimal effect on the morphology of nerve
fibers, although rare and sporadic alterations were present
in sciatic nerves (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Sciatic nerves
from mice receiving MTD of ixabepilone (3 mg/kg) showed
severe and frequent pathologic changes, represented by
different stages of axonal degeneration. As shown in Figure
5D, axonal degeneration seemed to affect both small- and
large-diameter fibers, although no regenerative figures (e.g.,
thin myelinated fibers) were present. Ixabepilone, at its
MTD, caused very severe, frequent, morphologic alterations,
both in neuronal and in glial compartments (Fig. 6D) of the
DRG. The neurons had dark cytoplasmic inclusions, often
localized to the perinuclear area. Moreover, clear vacuolations and swelling phenomena were evident in the cytoplasm of satellite cells. Changes were indicative of severely
injured and degenerating cells. Furthermore, adverse effects
of ixabepilone administration were evident with other doses.

dark inclusions and degenerating neurons, as well as
vacuoles of satellite cells, were also evident in the 0.75 

Discussion
Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity is a major
clinical problem representing the dose-limiting side effect of
many antineoplastic drugs, and it has a significant negative
impact on the quality of life and often results in treatment
delays or discontinuation (25â€“27). Indeed, neurotoxic side
effects associated with chemotherapies are second in frequency only to hematologic toxicities. Unlike the hematologic
side effects for which there are known effective treatments,
neurotoxicity side effects cannot be effectively treated or
prevented (28, 29). Neurotoxicity may develop as a consequence of treatment with platinum analogues (e.g., cisplatin,
oxaliplatin, carboplatin), taxanes (e.g., paclitaxel, docetaxel),
Vinca alkaloids (vincristine), and, more recently, thalidomide
and bortezomib as well as epothilones (9, 30). The degree and
type of neuropathy depend on the chemotherapeutic drug,
dose intensity, and cumulative dose. Recovery from peripheral

neurotoxicity symptoms is often incomplete, and a long
period of regeneration is sometimes required to restore
function.
Microtubule-targeting agents were first introduced into
clinical oncology in the 1960s and are essential components
in the therapy of many cancers, including lymphoma as well as
breast, ovarian, lung, and head and neck cancers (31). In spite
of their associated neurotoxic side effects, these agents, in
general, remain the most effective treatment options for
survival prolongation in advanced disease (32). The anticancer
effects of tubulin-targeting agents generally derive from their
ability to bind to microtubules, interfere with mitotic spindle
formation, and ultimately to block mitosis, resulting in cell
death. However, because somatic neurons do not divide, the
neurotoxic effects of tubulin-targeting agents could derive
from effects on interphase microtubules not involved in
mitosis. Although some information exists, our understanding
of the mechanisms behind the neurotoxic effects of tubulintargeting agents is far from complete. Further studies of the
neurotoxic side effects of tubulin-targeting chemotherapies
are thus warranted (33).
For the past 20 years, several chemotherapy-induced
neuropathy animal models have been published, most
commonly using rodents. Similar to the human situation,
chemotherapy-induced neuropathy rodent models are characterized by neurophysiologic deficits and morphologic

Neuropathy Induced by Eribulin, Paclitaxel, and Ixabepilone

alterations in DRG and myelinated nerve fibers (23, 34â€“36).
Somewhat surprisingly, in spite of the existence of such
models, to our knowledge, there has never been a systematic
comparison of the various microtubule-targeting agents in
preclinical models.
Eribulin mesylate, a nontaxane microtubule dynamics inhibitor belonging to the halichondrin class of antineoplastic
agents, is a structurally simplified macrocyclic ketone analogue of halichondrin B, a natural product originally isolated
from the marine sponge Halichondria okadai (17). Eribulin
mesylate is currently undergoing development for the treatment of advanced breast cancer and other solid tumors. Other
microtubule-targeting agents used to treat breast cancer
patients, including paclitaxel and ixabepilone, display a common dose-limiting toxicity of peripheral neuropathy. The
purpose of this study was to investigate neuropathy-inducing
effects of eribulin mesylate, compared with those of paclitaxel
or ixabepilone, in mice.
All 3 chemotherapeutic drugs have antineoplastic activity in
various animal models (6, 7, 17) and human cancer conditions
(2, 37, 38). Importantly, all 3 compounds have shown efficacy
in multiple in vivo cancer efficacy models at doses often less
than the MTD described in this study in the case of eribulin
mesylate (17), or generally comparable with the MTD, in the
case of paclitaxel (17) and ixabepilone (6, 7).
For example, eribulin mesylate has shown efficacy in a
human breast (MDA-MB-435) cancer xenograft model in
athymic mice at doses between 0.25 and 1.0 mg/kg using
a (Q2D  3) 4 weeks schedule (17). These efficacious doses
are lower than the MTD described in this study (1.75 mg/kg).
Paclitaxel has shown antineoplastic effects in the same
breast xenograft model at 25 mg/kg, similar to the MTD
described in this study (30 mg/kg; ref. 17). Ixabepilone has
shown antitumor activity in mouse models, including for
breast cancer [KPL4, Pat-21], at a dose range of 3.2 to 6.0 mg/
kg administered Q2D  5 or Q4D  3 (6, 7), which is also
similar to the ixabepilone MTD (3 mg/kg) employed in this
study. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the mice
used in this study received similar (paclitaxel, ixabepilone)
or greater (eribulin mesylate) exposures than those required
for efficacy.
Because these drugs have different potencies and pharmacokinetics, we compared them on the basis of MTD by
using a neuropathy-inducing dosing regimen (Q2D  3) for
2 weeks. Once MTDs were defined as 1.75 mg/kg eribulin
mesylate, 30 mg/kg paclitaxel, and 3.0 mg/kg ixabepilone,
we administered 0.25  MTD, 0.5  MTD, 0.75  MTD, and
MTD and evaluated their effects on NCV, amplitude, and
morphology of sciatic nerves and DRG. Using these comparisons, ixabepilone and paclitaxel dosed on a (Q2D  3)
for 2 weeks schedule were found to produce significant
deficits in conduction parameters of caudal and digital
nerves at doses of 0.5  MTD or more. In contrast, eribulin
mesylate induced no deficits in any monitored nerve conduction parameter (velocity or amplitude) at any dose
tested, including MTD (1.75 mg/kg). Similarly, although
all compounds produced morphologic changes in DRG and
sciatic nerves at MTD, the changes induced by eribulin

mesylate were noticeably fewer and less severe than those
seen with paclitaxel or ixabepilone at their respective
MTDs. Because all 3 agents target tubulin, the question
arises as to why eribulin mesylate is less damaging to
neurons in this mouse model.
Paclitaxel and ixabepilone are considered microtubulestabilizing agents because they promote polymerization of
microtubules and increase polymer mass in cells. In contrast, eribulin mesylate is a microtubule-destabilizing agent
because it binds to the Vinca-binding domain of tubulin and
inhibits tubulin polymerization, thereby inducing cell-cycle
arrest and apoptosis (10, 39). At low concentrations, both
stabilizers and destabilizers suppress microtubule dynamics
without changing polymer mass (40, 41). As the understanding of the interactions of tubulin-targeting agents at the
molecular level increases, differences in activity and side
effects may become clearer. Differences in microtubulebinding properties may have significant effects on the toxicity profile of each agent (10, 36).
In this context, Jordan and colleagues found that eribulin
mesylate affects microtubule growth phases, as opposed to
the shortening phase, in association with sequestration of
tubulin into aggregates (42). Eribulin mesylate binding
along microtubule sides has at least 10-fold lower affinity
than at the positive ends (16). This is in contrast to the
binding pattern of paclitaxel and ixabepilone, which each
affect both the growth and shortening phases of microtubule dynamics, and each of which are thought to target
the same, or close to the same, binding site on b-tubulin
(10, 43). As neuronal microtubules seem responsible for
intracellular transport of essential molecules along the
axon, it is possible that binding along the microtubule
sides may inhibit transport of essential molecules with
resulting peripheral neurotoxicity (44). These theories
require further investigation.
In spite of the limitations of this study, such as its relatively
short duration and small sample size, the findings suggest
that, if these animal studies are corroborated in the clinical
setting, eribulin mesylate could have a positive impact on the
side effect profile of cancer patients receiving microtubulebased therapies.
