Abstract
B-RafV600E inhibitors have been suggested to promote tumor regression with the help of host immunity, but
this hypothesis has not been examined directly in detail. In this study, we proﬁled immunologic changes in
the tumor microenvironment and tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in a B-RafV600E/Pten-driven murine
model of melanoma after administration of the B-RafV600E small molecule inhibitor PLX4720. In this model,
we found that as tumors developed, they gradually acquired immunosuppressive features, including
accumulation of regulatory T cells (Treg) and CD11bþ/Gr-1þ myeloid cells and loss of Th1 effector functions
on CD4þ TILs, such as CD40L and IFNg expression. PLX4720 administration promoted development of a
more immune stimulatory microenvironment associated with a relative increase in CD40L and IFNg
expression on intratumoral CD4þ TILs and a reduced accumulation of Tregs and CD11bþ/Gr-1þ myeloid
cells. Strikingly, CD40L or IFNg blockade compromised the ability of PLX4720 to inhibit melanoma growth.
Supporting this result, agonistic CD40 antibody was sufﬁcient to evoke antitumor immunity and suppress
tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice. Taken together, our results establish the critical role of immune-related
changes, with key contributions for CD40L and IFNg signaling in the antitumor responses triggered in vivo by
B-RafV600E inhibitors. Cancer Res; 74(12); 3205–17. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Melanoma is considered a highly aggressive form of
cancer and its resistance to chemotherapy results in highmortality rates (1, 2). More than 50% of melanomas contain
the V600E mutation in the B-Raf kinase gene (BrafV600E),
which causes constitutive activation of B-Raf and the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway
that contributes to malignancy by increasing cellular glycolysis, anabolic metabolism, proliferation, and suppressing
apoptosis (1, 3, 4). Selective inhibitors targeting the oncogenic BrafV600E, but not wild-type B-Raf kinase, have been
shown to trigger apoptosis and reduce proliferation in
melanoma cell lines in in vitro cell culture and in vivo animal
models. Importantly, treatment of patients with metastatic
melanoma harboring BrafV600E mutation with the oral Braf
inhibitors, vemurafenib and dabrafenib, prevents tumor
progression in a high frequency of patients and in some

cases induces tumor regression, and vemurafenib improves
overall survival compared with chemotherapy (1, 4, 5).
Despite the initial therapeutic beneﬁts of vemurafenib,
resistance to treatment inevitably occurs within a few
months and this progressive form of melanoma seems
intractable to current therapies (4). Multiple mechanisms,
including additional mutations in RAS kinase and other
proteins in the MAPK pathway, are involved in developing
resistance to BrafV600E inhibitors (4).
Tumors are inﬁltrated by several types of immune cells,
including T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and macrophages that have the potential to kill tumor cells or curb their
growth via production of cytotoxic molecules, chemokines,
and inﬂammatory cytokines (6, 7). However, their antitumor
functions are commonly suppressed by other immunoregulatory immune cells, such as regulatory T cells (Tregs),
myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC, categorized by
CD11bþ/Gr-1þ surface staining), alternative activated
macrophages (often referred to as M2-like macrophages),
and immature or tolerogenic dendritic cells that also accumulate within the tumor microenvironment (8). In addition
to blocking antitumor immune responses, these immunomodulatory cells can also promote tumor growth and metastasis through secretion of angiogenic factors (e.g., VEGF).
Intratumoral T cells also upregulate inhibitory receptors,
such as PD1, TIM3, CTLA4, and LAG3, which further repress
antitumor effector functions upon ligand binding in the
tumor microenvironment (9, 10). Importantly, recent clinical
trials have found that blocking CTLA4 and PD1 signaling

with monoclonal antibodies can evoke preexisting antitumor
immunity and cause partial or, in some cases, complete
tumor regression in a fraction of patients (11, 12). In contrast
to the negative signaling pathways controlled by PD1 and
CTLA4, CD40:CD40L signaling and costimulatory ligands,
including CD70 and CD86, have been suggested to provide
positive signals that boost antitumor immunity (13–16).
These studies demonstrate the potential power of immunotherapy in treating cancer, but the issue remains that a large
number of patients are unresponsive to these immunotherapies for reasons that are not entirely clear.
The BrafV600E mutation has a direct role in driving cellular
transformation, but multiple studies suggest that it also indirectly modulates the tumor microenvironment. For instance,
tumors treated with BrafV600E inhibitors displayed increased T
lymphocyte inﬁltration and expression of melanoma antigens,
MHCI, and PDL1 expression (17–21). Similarly, mice engrafted
with a melanoma cell line and treated with the vemurafenib
analogue PLX4720 also demonstrated increased T-cell inﬁltration in tumors and responsiveness to antigens (18, 22). The
antitumor effects of PLX4720 in this engraftment model was
particularly dependent on CD8 T cells and could be enhanced
by CD137 agonistic mAb treatment, suggesting that BrafV600E
inhibitors can sensitize tumors to certain immunotherapies
(22). In contrast, another study concluded that PLX4720
decreased T-cell inﬁltration in the tumors and were unable
to enhance antitumor responses in conjunction with CTLA4
blockade (23). Thus, more investigation is needed to better
characterize the nature of the tumor microenvironment in
melanoma and how BrafV600E inhibitors affect the function of
inﬁltrating immune cells. Elucidating signals that create a
more immunostimulatory tumor microenvironment by
BrafV600E inhibitors could offer mechanistic insight into drug
action and potentially identify new drug targets for improving
anticancer therapies.
This study focused on the effects of PLX4720 on antitumor
immunity in an inducible murine melanoma model that
provides a highly physiologically relevant setting for studying
the complex interplay between tumor, stromal, and immune
cells in the tumor microenvironment. We found that as
tumors grew the tumor microenvironment gradually acquired
immunosuppressive features, including accumulation of
Tregs and CD11bþ/Gr-1þ myeloid cells and reduced effector
functions of tumor-inﬁltrating CD4 T cells. Importantly,
PLX4720-stimulated host antitumor immune responses that
inhibited tumor progression through CD40L- and IFNgdependent mechanisms. Interestingly, blockade of CD40:
CD40L or IFNg signaling differentially affected the immunoregulatory cells in the tumor microenvironment, suggesting
these signaling pathways operate in a nonoverlapping manner. We also demonstrated that agonistic anti-CD40 antibody
treatment alone was effective to inhibit tumor growth in
this model. These ﬁndings reveal that host immunity is a
critical component of B-RafV600E inhibitor-mediated tumor
suppression and provide new immunotherapeutic targets,
such as CD40 and IFNg, for enhancing antimelanoma immunity that could be used in conjunction with B-RafV600E inhibitors or other immunotherapies.

Materials and Methods
Mouse breeding and tumor induction
The BRafCA; Tyr::CreER; Ptenlox4-5 (Braf/Pten) mice were
previously described (3) and Pmel TCR transgenic mice were
purchased from Jackson laboratory (24). For local tumor
induction, 3-week-old Braf/Pten mice were administrated with
1 mL 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT; 8 mg/mL in ethanol) topically
on the back skin and examined every week for melanoma
growth. All animal experiments were performed according to
the approved protocols of Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee.
Tumor digestion
Tumors were minced in digestion media (Hank's Balanced
Salt Solution with 0.5 mg/mL collagenase IV and 200 mg/mL
DNase), incubated at 37 C for 1 hour and ﬁltered to remove
undigested tumor pieces. Single-cell suspensions were then
incubated with 2-mL ACK lysis buffer (Invitrogen), washed
and resuspended in complete RPMI.
Flow cytometry and cell sorting
Single-cell suspensions from tumors or splenocytes were
incubated with anti-Fc receptor antibody (2.4G2) on ice for 15
minutes in FACS buffer (PBS with 1% FBS and sodium azide).
The cells were then stained with the appropriate antibodies in
2.4G2-containing FACS buffer on ice for 30 minutes. For
intracellular cytokine staining, T cells were stimulated with
phorbol 12—myristate 13—acetate (PMA)/ionomycin (Sigma
Aldrich) and Brefeldin A for 5 hours, stained with surface
antibodies and then ﬁxed in Cytoﬁx/Cytoperm buffer (BD Biosciences) or transcription factor staining buffer (ebioscience)
and stained with antibodies to detect intracellular cytokines or
FoxP3, respectively. All samples were acquired on LSRII ﬂow
cytometer and analyzed Flowjo. Cell sorting was performed on
BD FACS Aria in Yale Cell Sorter Core Facility. Tumor-inﬁltrating dendritic cells (TIDC) were sorted based on the following markers: CD45þ/CD3/CD11cþ/Gr-1. TAMs were sorted
based on the following markers: CD45þ/CD3/CD11bþ/Gr1/F4/80þ. Antibodies against CD45 (A20), CD8 (53-6.7), CD3
(145-2C11), CD44 (IM7), CD11c (N418), CD11b (M1/70), Gr-1
(RB6-8C5), IFNg (XMG1.2), IL2 (JES6-5H4), TNFa (TN3-19),
FoxP3 (FJK-16s), MHCII (M5/114.15.2), and CD70 (FR70) were
purchased from eBioscience. Antibodies against CD4 (RM4-5),
F4/80 (BM8), CD40L (MR1), MHCI (KH95), CD80 (16-10A1),
and CD40 (3/23) were from Biolegend and anti-CD86 (GL1) was
from BD Biosciences.
In vivo treatment of PLX4720 and agonistic anti-CD40
antibody
Five weeks after tumor induction, tumor-bearing BrafV600E/
Pten mice were fed with normal or PLX4720-containing chow
(417 mg PLX4720/kg; generously provided by Plexxikon) for
another 21 days. Tumor weight and tumor-inﬁltrating immune
cells were assessed following treatments. In some cases, the
Braf/Pten mice (either on normal or PLX4720-containing
chow) were administered anti-CD40L (MR1) or -IFNg (XMG1.2;
250 mg/mouse i.p.) or control vehicle (PBS) every 3 days from

weeks 5 to 7. Alternatively, Braf/Pten mice were treated with
control IgG or agonistic anti-CD40 antibody (FGK45; 250 mg/
mouse) every 3 days from weeks 6 to 8. Tumor growth was
determined by measuring the tumor height with a caliper every
3 days and at the end of treatment, tumors were resected and
tumor weight and immune response were determined.
T-cell proliferation assay
Splenic cells of Pmel TCR transgenic mice were collected
and CD8þ Pmel T cells were enriched by negative CD8 T-Cell
Enrichment Kit (Stemcell Technologies). Na€ve CD8þ Pmel T
cells were further puriﬁed by removing CD44þ cells with Biotin
Selection Kit (Stemcell Technologies). Puriﬁed na€ve Pmel
cells were then loaded with 2 mmol/L CFSE at room temperature for 15 minutes. CFSE-labeled na€ve CD8þ Pmel T cells
were mixed with TIDCs in a 5:1 ratio in the presence of 1 mg/mL
gp100. For agonistic anti-CD40 antibody, the cell mixtures
were incubated with 50 mg/mL of IgG (Bioxcell) or agonistic
anti-CD40 antibody (FGK45; Bioxcell) during this period. Proliferation of CD8þ Pmel T cells was determined by FACS
analysis to measure CFSE dilution.
RNA puriﬁcation and quantitative real-time RT-PCR
For RNA puriﬁcation, TRIzol (Invitrogen) reagent was used
to extract total RNA according to manufacturer's instruction
and cDNAs were synthesized using SuperScript II Reverse
Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time PCR was
performed on Mx3000P qPCR System (Agilent Technologies)
with iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Primer
sequences to indicated mRNAs were listed in Supplementary
Table. Ct values were measured and relative gene expression
was calculated using DDCt method.
Statistics
Data were presented in means  SD. Statistical analysis was
performed by unpaired Student t test and P value < 0.05 was
considered as statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
BrafV600E/Pten melanomas acquire an
immunosuppressive microenvironment during
tumorigenesis
We ﬁrst examined the immune cell inﬁltrate in melanomas
in the Tyr-creERT2/BrafV600E/Ptenlox mice. In this system,
application of 4-HT to the skin initiates melanoma formation
by introducing constitutively active form of B-Raf kinase
(BrafV600E) and Pten deletion in melanocytes (3, 25). It takes
approximately 8 weeks for these tumors to grow to a size more
than 200 mm2 and mice usually die within 10 weeks after tumor
induction (3). To examine if there were any changes in the
tumor microenvironment associated with tumor progression,
we collected tumor samples from mice at early stages (5 weeks)
and advanced stages (8 weeks) after 4-HT induction and
examined multiple properties of the intratumoral immune
cells using ﬂow cytometry (Fig. 1A). Several notable observations were made during this longitudinal study. First, the
frequency of tumor-inﬁltrating CD4þ and CD8þ T lymphocytes

www.aacrjournals.org

increased as tumors progressed and CD4þ T cells were the
dominant T-cell population in this model (Fig. 1B). In addition,
we found that the frequency of CD11bþ/Gr-1þ cells (commonly
referred to as MDSCs) increased, but the populations of
TIDCs (CD45þ/CD11cþ/Gr-1) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) (CD45þ/CD11bþ/F4/80þ/Gr-1) decreased as
the tumor grew (Fig. 1B). Gating criteria for above myeloid
cell populations are shown in Supplementary Fig. S1; note
40% of TIDC expressed F4/80 as reported previously (26).
We also determined the frequency of FoxP3þ Tregs among
tumor-inﬁltrating CD4 T cells and found that FoxP3þ Tregs
accumulated in the tumors over time (Fig. 1C). Importantly,
the frequency of FoxP3þ Tregs in the spleen of tumor-bearing
animals did not change over this time period, indicating that
the increase in intratumoral Tregs was unique to the tumor
microenvironment and not because of systemic increases in
Tregs in the animals.
The increase in two immunosuppressive cell types, CD11bþ/
Gr-1þ cells and Tregs, in BrafV600E/Pten melanomas prompted
us to assess the effector functions of tumor-inﬁltrating T
lymphocytes. We did not detect statistically signiﬁcant
changes in effector cytokine production in tumor-inﬁltrating
CD8 T cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). However, the percentage
of IFNg, TNFa, and IL2-producing CD4 T cells decreased as
tumors grew (Fig. 1D). Intriguingly, the loss of cytokine production between early and advanced tumor stages also correlated with a decrease in expression of the costimulatory
ligand CD40L on the FoxP3 (non-Treg) CD4 T cells (Fig. 1E).
Taken together, these results showed that as BrafV600E/Pten
melanomas grew, the tumor microenvironment acquired multiple immunosuppressive features wherein Tregs and MDSCs
accumulated, and critical CD4 T-cell helper and effector functions decayed. These changes might lead to ineffective antitumor immune responses and the establishment of a protumorigenic microenvironment.
Accumulation of immature antigen-presenting cells and
M2-like macrophages in BrafV600E/Pten melanomas
CD40:CD40L signaling is a critical licensing mechanism that
enhances maturation of dendritic cells and macrophages and
helps boost CD8 T-cell activation and expansion under lessinﬂammatory conditions (27, 28). In macrophages, CD40:
CD40L signaling promotes the development of classically
activated (M1)-like macrophages that produce IL12 to help
TH1 differentiation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
nitric oxide (NO) to eliminate pathogens or cancer cells
(13, 28–30). In contrast, tumors typically contain alternatively
activated (M2)-like macrophages that produce IL10, VEGF, and
matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) that assist type-2 immune
responses and/or dampen immune responses to promote
wound healing (31). Although a variety of mechanisms can
regulate macrophage skewing from M1 ! M2-like states in
tumors, it has not been well explored if this involves changes in
CD40:CD40L signaling within the tumor microenvironment
(8, 32, 33). Because the expression of CD40L declined on CD4 T
cells as BrafV600E/Pten melanomas progressed, we postulated
that the maturation or activation status of TIDCs and TAMs
might also be affected. Interestingly, in early-stage tumors

(5 weeks), we observed relatively high amounts of MHC
class I and II and costimulatory ligands (CD70, CD80, and
CD86) expression on both TIDCs and TAMs. However,
the expression of these proteins declined substantially in the
advanced stage tumors present at 8 weeks (Fig. 2A).
We next probed the macrophages for M1- and M2-like
markers during tumor progression, and found that the
expression of M1-like cytokines Il1b, Il6, and Il12 declined
whereas the expression of Tnfa and M2-like genes, including Arg1, Chi3l3, Mr1, and Mmp9, increased (Fig. 2B). This
result indicated more M2-like macrophages resided in latestage tumors. Moreover, TIDCs isolated from advanced
BrafV600E/Pten melanomas lost their capacity to stimulate
gp100-speciﬁc (Pmel) CD8 T-cell proliferation as compare to
TIDCs isolated from early stage of tumors (Fig. 2C). Taken
together, these results showed a gradual loss of mature
antigen-presenting cells (APC), but an accumulation of
M2-like macrophages as BrafV600E/Pten melanomas grew.
To test whether APCs in advanced BrafV600E/Pten melanomas were responsive or nonresponsive to CD40:CD40L signaling, we incubated the TAMs and TIDCs puriﬁed from
advanced BrafV600E/Pten melanomas with control IgG or
agonistic anti-CD40 antibody (FGK45) overnight. Indeed,
TAMs were responsive to CD40:CD40L signaling and M1like gene expression was upregulated more profoundly than

3208

Cancer Res; 74(12) June 15, 2014

M2-like gene expression (Fig. 2D). In addition, FGK45 mAb
enhanced the ability of the advanced staged TIDCs to
stimulate na€ve Pmel CD8 T cell activation and proliferation
(Fig. 2E). These data suggest that TIDCs and TAMs in
advanced BrafV600E/Pten melanomas had developed tolerogenic features commonly associated with tumors such as
reduced expression of MHC and costimulatory ligands and
that the TAMs had undergone an M1 ! M2-like phenotypic
switch. However, both TIDCs and TAMs of advanced staged
melanoma were sensitive to CD40:CD40L signaling, suggesting a model whereby as the tumors grow, the loss of CD4
T cell CD40L expression may contribute to the decline in
APC maturation and thus, T-cell activity.
PLX4720 treatment inhibits accumulation of
immunoregulatory cells and restores effector functions
of tumor-inﬁltrating CD4 T cells
Although host immunity has been implicated in the
antitumor effects of BrafV600E inhibitors in melanoma, it is
not clear which immune signaling pathways are most affected by BrafV600E inhibitors and how these pathways alter the
tumor microenvironment and antitumor immune responses.
Therefore, we next sought to determine whether PLX4720
therapy could alter the phenotype or function of tumorinﬁltrating immune cells. We induced BrafV600E/Pten

melanomas and after 5 weeks the mice were treated with
normal chow or that which contains PLX4720 (PLX diet) for
another 3 weeks (Fig. 3A). As expected, PLX4720 treatment
signiﬁcantly decreased tumor weight (Fig. 3B). In agreement
with recent studies, we also observed a 5-fold increase in the
number of CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes (Fig. 3C) inﬁltrating
PLX4720-treated melanomas, but not the spleen, and this
was conﬁrmed by anti-CD3 immunohistochemical staining
of tumor sections (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. S3; refs. 18
and 19). In addition, the frequency of intratumoral FoxP3þ
Treg CD4 T cells was reduced 3- to 4-fold after PLX4720
treatment, whereas no effect was observed in the spleen
(Fig. 3E). These results suggested that PLX4720 affected the
recruitment of Tregs into tumors or directly modulated
inducible-Treg (iTreg) formation in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, these data imply that PLX4720 preferentially promoted the accumulation of FoxP3 CD4 T cells

www.aacrjournals.org

(non-Tregs) within the tumors, which may contain "helper"
cells to boost antitumor responses.
Because we found that expression of effector cytokines from
intratumoral CD4 T cells declined during tumor progression,
we next tested whether PLX4720 treatment affected CD4 T-cell
cytokine production. After PLX4720 therapy, a larger fraction
of tumor-inﬁltrating CD4 T cells produced IFNg (i.e., TH1
cells; Fig. 3F). However, PLX4702 treatment did not affect the
CD4 T-cell production of IL2 and TNFa. More notably,
PLX4720 treatment also augmented the expression of CD40L
on intratumoral CD4 T cells (Fig. 3G). Intriguingly, PLX4720
treatment robustly promoted PD1 expression on intratumoral
CD4 T cells and the frequency of PD1þ CD4 T cells (Supplementary Fig. S4), supporting a similar observation in
human melanoma following vemurafenib treatment (21).
These results demonstrate that BrafV600E inhibitors have a
potent immunostimulatory activity in the BrafV600E/Pten

BRAF Inhibitor-Induced Antitumor Immunity

murine melanoma mouse and can greatly boost the effector
T-cell:Treg ratio and TH1 effector and helper functions within
tumors.
Next, we investigated whether PLX4720 treatment also
modulated the frequency or phenotype of tumor-inﬁltrating
myeloid cells. First, we noted that PLX4720 therapy reduced
the frequency of intratumoral CD11bþ/Gr-1þ cells by 4- to
5-fold and slightly decreased the frequency of TAMs, but
no in the TIDCs (Fig. 3H). PLX4720 therapy also enhanced
the maturation status of both TAMs and TIDCs (Fig. 3I),
suggesting that intratumoral APCs might possess a higher
capability to activate and expand T cells and promote
TH1-polarized differentiation. Altogether, these ﬁndings
demonstrated that PLX4720 treatment had potent immunostimulatory effects on the phenotype and function of
innate and adaptive immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. PLX4720 treatment promoted the expression of
IFNg and CD40L on CD4 T cells, MHC, and costimulatory
ligands on APCs and repressed accumulation of Tregs and
CD11bþ/Gr-1þ population, which collectively, may lead to
enhanced antitumor immune responses.
PLX4720 suppressing tumor growth is partially
dependent on CD4 T cells
Next, we investigated whether T cells contribute to PLX4720
antitumor effect. Tumors were induced in BrafV600E/Pten mice
and 5 weeks later the mice were treated with PLX4720 with or

without TIB210 or GK1.5 mAbs for 15 days to deplete CD8 or
CD4 T cells, respectively (Fig. 4A). The depleting antibodies
reduced both splenic and intratumoral CD8 or CD4 T cells
after 15 days of treatment (Supplementary Fig. S5). Surprisingly, the reduction in tumor growth by PLX4720 treatment
did not depend on CD8 T cells, but was partially dependent
on CD4 T cells (Fig. 4B–E). These results suggest that CD4
T cells play a more dominant role in the PLX4720-mediated
antitumor response than CD8 T cells. Note, we also examined
whether the elevated CD70 expression on APCs after PLX4720
therapy contributed to its ability to reverse tolerant CTLs
and retard tumor growth (14, 15, 34), but found that blocking
CD70 did not perturb the ability of PLX4720 to inhibit
tumor progression in any detectable manner (Supplementary
Fig. S6).
PLX4720 therapy enhances maturation of APCs and
decreases accumulation of Tregs in BrafV600E/Pten
melanomas in a CD40L-dependent manner
Because the antitumor response of PLX4720 treatment
was compromised when CD4 T cells were depleted, it is
possible that augmented effector and helper CD4 T-cell
functions contribute to PLX4720-mediated immunostimulation of tumor microenvironment. CD40:CD40L signaling
can augment immune surveillance of tumors by enhancing APC maturation, boosting macrophages' cytotoxicity,
and elevating CTL proliferation and effector functions

(13, 27–29, 35). To determine if increased CD40L expression
on intratumoral CD4 T cells during PLX4720 treatment was
functionally relevant, we blocked CD40L signaling during
PLX4720 treatment using the anti-CD40L antibody (MR1;
ref. 36). Tumors were induced in BrafV600E/Pten mice and
5 weeks later the mice were treated with PLX4720 with or
without anti-CD40L mAb (MR1) for 2 weeks. We found
that blocking CD40:CD40L signaling strongly interfered
with the antitumor effects of PLX4720 treatment because
the BrafV600E/Pten melanomas grew in the PLX dietþMR1
treated animals at rates similar to, but slightly less than
untreated vehicle-injected control animals (Fig. 5A–C). MR1
treatment by itself did not have a signiﬁcant effect on tumor
growth in animals on normal chow diet. These results
demonstrate that CD40:CD40L signaling was required for
the suppression of tumor growth by PLX4720 therapy and

suggest that host immunity contributes to the therapeutic
effects of BrafV600E inhibition on melanoma growth.
Further comparison revealed that the reduction in inﬁltrating Tregs observed during PLX4720 treatment was also
dependent on CD40L signaling because greater percentages
of Tregs were found in PLXþMR1–treated tumors as compared with those given PLX-alone (Fig. 5D). Similarly, CD40L
signaling was important for the signiﬁcant increase in total
CD4 and CD8 T cells in the melanomas caused by PLX4720
treatment (Fig. 5E). In contrast, CD40L blockade did not
affect the ability of PLX4720 treatment to reduce CD11bþ
/Gr-1þ population frequencies (Fig. 5F). Next, we sought to
test if the enhanced maturation of intratumoral APCs
observed during PLX4720 treatment was dependent on
CD40:CD40L signaling. Indeed, CD40L blockade prevented
PLX4720 therapy-induced elevation of MHC class I and

BRAF Inhibitor-Induced Antitumor Immunity

CD70 on both TAMs and TIDCs (Fig. 5G). These experiments show that several of the notable immunostimulatory
effects of PLX4720 on the microenvironment of melanoma
depend on CD40L signaling, including the increased effector
T-cell:Treg ratio and maturation status of APCs. These
ﬁndings provide novel mechanistic insight into therapeutic
effects of Braf inhibitors in melanoma and implicate host
immunity as a critical part of the antitumor effects of these
types of drugs.
IFNg contributes to reduction of intratumoral CD11bþ/
Gr-1þ myeloid cells upon PLX4720 treatment
In addition to CD40L, IFNg is another antitumor immunologic factor that can promote MHC expression on both
APCs and tumor cells, trigger tumor cell senescence and
polarize M1-like macrophages (37, 38). Because the frequency of IFNg-producing CD4 T cells was increased in the
tumors after PLX4720 therapy, we next investigated if IFNg
itself was also involved in PLX4720-mediated antitumor
responses by blocking IFNg with the mAb XMG1.2 at the
time of PLX4720 treatment. This showed that the therapeutic effects of PLX4720 were compromised in mice receiving
IFNg-neutralizing mAb because, as observed with blocking
CD40L, the tumors in these mice grew at rates comparable

to those left untreated (Fig. 6A–C). IFNg-neutralizing antibody did not escalate tumor growth in mice receiving chow
diet. We then examined which changes in the tumor microenvironment induced by PLX4720 therapy were IFNg dependent. First, in contrast to anti-CD40L blockade, IFNg blockade had minimal effect on altering intratumoral Treg frequency in either the normal- or PLX-diet fed mice (Fig. 6D).
However, we found that blocking IFNg suppressed the
PLX4720-induced increase in inﬁltrating CD4 and CD8 T
cells into the tumors, albeit the effects on CD4 T cells were
insigniﬁcant (Fig. 6E). Although no notable changes in
percentage of TAMs or TIDCs were observed when IFNg
was blocked during PLX4720 treatment (Supplementary Fig.
S7), the frequency of CD11bþ/Gr-1þ myeloid cells increased
considerably in the tumors (Fig. 6F). This suggested that
IFNg-blockade affected CD11bþ/Gr-1þ myeloid cells accumulation in tumors. We also examined the expression of
MHCI and CD70 on TAMs and TIDCs and found that IFNg
blockade prevented PLX4720-induced upregulation of these
proteins on APCs (Fig. 6G). Overall, these data showed that
IFNg was necessary for the PLX4720-mediated maturation of
APCs and reduction of intratumotal CD11bþ/Gr-1þ myeloid
cells, which likely contributed to antitumor effects of
PLX4720 in BrafV600E/Pten melanomas.

Agonistic anti-CD40 antibody elicits antitumor response
and promotes maturation of intratumoral APCs in
BrafV600E/Pten mice
The above ﬁndings reveal that the CD40:CD40L and IFNg
signaling pathways have potent antitumor activities during
PLX4720 treatment, identifying new therapeutic opportunities to treat melanoma. Because agonistic anti-CD40 mAb
treatment can evoke antitumor immune responses, we
sought to evaluate the antitumor responses of agonistic
anti-CD40 mAb in the BrafV600E/Pten murine melanoma
model. To this end, BrafV600E/Pten melanomas were allowed
to progress for 6 weeks, and then the mice were injected with
control IgG or agonistic anti-CD40 antibody (FGK45; 250
mg/mouse) every 3 days for another 15 days. This experiment
revealed that agonistic anti-CD40 mAb treatment could
restrict tumor growth considerably (Fig. 7A–C). Importantly,
mice treated with FGK45 mAb exhibited splenomegaly, yet

no signiﬁcant increases of intratumoral CD4 and CD8 T
cells or CD11bþ/Gr-1þ myeloid cells were observed (Supplementary Fig. S8A–S8D). However, the number of splenic
and intratumoral Tregs was increased by FGK45 treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S8E). Notably, agonistic anti-CD40
mAb treatment augmented the maturation status of both
TAMs and TIDCs in BrafV600E/Pten melanomas (Fig. 7D).
We observed that neither CD45 cells (including both tumor
and stromal cells) directly isolated from BrafV600E/Pten
melanomas nor a Braf/Pten-derived melanoma cell line
expressed CD40 by ﬂow cytometry (Supplementary Fig.
S9), lessening the possibility that FGK45 triggers antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) of tumor
cells. We next examined whether T cells are required for
FGK45-dependent restriction of tumor growth, and surprisingly, T-cell depletion did not compromise the antitumor
effects of FGK45 mAb treatment (Fig. 7E and F). Altogether,

BRAF Inhibitor-Induced Antitumor Immunity

these results suggest that the apparent decline in CD40:
CD40L signaling that occurs during BrafV600E/Pten melanoma progression contributes to the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment, and augmentation of
CD40 signaling via agonistic anti-CD40 mAb is a signiﬁcant
form of immunotherapy, that can operate independently of
T cells, to reduce BrafV600E/Pten melanoma growth.

Discussion
BrafV600E is a common driver-oncogene in melanoma and
other cancers. Clinically available BrafV600E inhibitors suppress tumor growth and it has been suggested that antitumor host immunity can be enhanced by these drugs (18–21).
This study aimed to investigate the immune responses
during tumor progression in an inducible BrafV600E/Ptenlox
murine melanoma model and identify how the BrafV600E
inhibitor PLX4720 altered the tumor microenvironment and
inﬁltrating immune cells. We wanted to determine whether
particular aspects of immune functions, cell types, or signaling pathways contributed to the therapeutic effects of
BrafV600E inhibition, as previously intimated by some studies
in patients with melanoma (18–23, 39, 40). We found that the
tumor microenvironment in BrafV600E/Pten melanomas
acquired multiple immunosuppressive features, including
accumulation of Tregs, CD11bþ/Gr-1þ myeloid cells, and
immature APCs. Furthermore, intratumoral CD4 T cells lost
their ability to exert effector (IFNg) and helper (CD40L)
functions. Surprisingly, PLX4720 therapy augmented the
expression of CD40L and IFNg on tumor-inﬁltrating CD4
T cells and impeded intratumoral accumulation of Tregs
and CD11bþ/Gr-1þ myeloid cells. To our knowledge, this is
the ﬁrst report that these particular CD4 T cell functions can
be modulated by BrafV600E inhibitor treatment. Moreover,
we also found that treatment with an agonistic anti-CD40
mAb provided signiﬁcant therapeutic beneﬁts in suppressing melanoma growth and enhancing maturation of APCs
in the BrafV600E/Pten melanoma model. Altogether, these
ﬁndings support the model that CD40L is critical in mounting protective antimelanoma immunity and have important
implications in clinical trials involving immunotherapy.
Possibly, combinational therapy with anti-CD40 agonists
plus vemurafenib, anti-PD1, or anti-CTLA4 will enhance
patient outcomes.
Vemurafenib and other BrafV600E inhibitors were originally
believed to affect cell proliferation and trigger apoptosis and
senescence on tumor cells harboring BrafV600E mutation. However, a number of studies revealed that BrafV600E inhibitors
might boost immunosurveillance of tumors in both patients
and mice. Using melanoma cell line engraftment models in
mice, several effects of Braf inhibition have been reported,
such as increased tumor-inﬁltrating T lymphocytes, reduced
intratumoral Tregs and CD11bþ/Gr-1þ myeloid cells, and
decreased CCL2, IL1a, and IL1b expression of tumor cells
(18–23, 39, 40). Although these studies suggested that host
immunity is critical to maximize the therapeutic efﬁcacy of
BrafV600E inhibitors, tumors arising from engrafted cell lines
are likely more immunogenic and most certainly do not fully

www.aacrjournals.org

recapitulate the microenvironment of tumors that arise endogenously in vivo. Therefore, elucidating which elements of
the immune system are involved in the antitumor effects of
BrafV600E inhibitors and how BrafV600E inhibitors relieve the
immunosuppressive restraints imposed by the tumor microenvironment in a more pathophysiologically relevant murine
model may enhance the development of antimelanoma immunotherapies. For this reason, we took the advantage of the
inducible BrafV600E/Pten melanoma model to investigate
these important questions in a more physiologic manner.
Our results showed that PLX4720 treatment signiﬁcantly promoted tumor inﬁltration of T cells that depended on CD40:
CD40L and IFNg signaling. However, PLX4720 treatment has
also been shown to decrease intratumoral lymphocyte frequencies in BrafV600E/Pten melanoma model (23, 40) and the
discrepancy between these studies might be because of different methods of tumor-inﬁltrating immune cell isolation
and/or calculation of cell numbers (41). Our analysis went
further and identiﬁed several previously unrecognized immunostimulatory effects of PLX4720 treatment on the immune
microenvironment of tumors. Although adoptive CD4 T-cell
transfer can help to establish antitumor immune responses
(42, 43), the precise mechanisms are poorly understood and
a recent report showed that CD4 T lymphocytes are required
to re-establish antitumor immunity upon oncogene inactivation (44). In agreement with these ﬁndings, our results reveal
that CD4 T cells contribute to PLX4720-induced antitumor
responses and delineate underlying immune signaling pathways (e.g., IFNg and CD40L) that break an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.
Although we found that PLX4720 therapy augmented the
effector and helper functions of tumor-inﬁltrating CD4 T cells
and diminished the accumulation of intratumoral Tregs in
BrafV600E/Pten melanomas, the underlying mechanism(s) by
which PLX4720 induces these immunostimulatory properties
remain unclear. In addition to inhibiting B-Raf kinase, some
BrafV600E inhibitors also paradoxically enhance C-Raf kinase
activity by promoting heterodimerization between C-Raf and
wild-type B-Raf (4). Although recent studies showed that
PLX4720 and vemurafenib do not affect T lymphocyte functions and viability in a broad range of concentrations (4), this
does not necessarily rule out that the effects we observed are
independent C-Raf activity alteration. Moreover, the BrafV600E
mutation remodels the metabolic activities of cancer cells and
BrafV600E inhibitors can decrease glycolysis and glutaminolysis
and elevate oxidative phosphorylation in melanomas (45–47).
Given that nutrients, such as glutamine, arginine, and glucose,
are critical for effector T-cell function and differentiation (48),
it is possible that PLX4720-induced changes in tumor metabolism may indirectly lead to TH1 or M1-like polarization in
T cells and macrophages, respectively. Additional studies are
needed to further elucidate the mechanisms by which PLX4720
treatment enhances immune activity and these could reveal
previously unappreciated mechanisms of immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment.
Melanoma cells have been shown to promote accumulation
of Tregs and possibly CD11bþ/Gr-1þ myeloid cells by secreting
large amount of CCL2 and VEGF (18, 22), and accumulation

of these immunomodulatory cells could dampen the activity
and helper functions of T cells in tumors (8, 32, 33). Interestingly, our results demonstrated that CD40L and IFNg blockade during PLX4720 treatment differentially affected the inﬁltration of intratumoral Tregs and CD11bþ/Gr-1þ myeloid
cells, respectively, indicating that the accumulation of these
cells in tumors is likely governed by distinct pathways. Because
CD11bþ/Gr-1þ myeloid cells are immature myeloid cells and
IFNg can promote their differentiation into macrophages
both in vitro and in vivo (38, 49), PLX4720 therapy might reduce
the size of the CD11bþ/Gr-1þ myeloid cells population by
interfering with their recruitment or promoting their differentiation in an IFNg-dependent manner. However, CD40L
blockade can ameliorate autoimmune disease and rejection
of cardiac allograft by inducing Treg formation and suppressing T- and B-cell activation and antibody production (36).
Therefore, it is possible that the loss of CD40L signaling on
T cells as tumors progress might facilitate Treg formation and
impede T-cell activation within tumors. We also found that
administration of agonistic anti-CD40 mAb alone could suppress tumor progression in this model of melanoma. Agonistic
anti-CD40 antibody has been shown to be a new therapeutic
option for a variety of cancers in preclinical studies and
humanized anti-CD40 antibodies are under phase I trial
(13, 27, 29). Activation of intratumoral macrophages and/or
rejuvenation of exhausted or tolerized T cells might underlie
the antitumor effects of this drug, but it is not clear if agonistic
anti-CD40 antibody could potentiate the therapeutic efﬁcacy
of other immunotherapies. Because anti-CD40 treatment
impedes BrafV600E/Pten melanoma growth in a T-cell–independent manner, it is possible other immunotherapies that
enhance TIL recruitment or function may act in synergy with
anti-CD40 mAb treatment and provide alternative forms of
treatment for BrafV600E inhibitor-resistant melanomas.
Collectively, we found that PLX4720 treatment created a
immunostimulatory tumor microenvironment, in part, by
augmenting CD40:CD40L and IFNg signaling. A future goal
will be to evaluate the therapeutic efﬁcacy of treatments that
enhance CD40L and IFNg signaling in combination with
BrafV600E inhibitors or other immunotherapies. After prolonged treatment, tumor cells acquire resistance to BrafV600E
inhibitors with additional mutations in MAPK pathways and
other signaling cascades. However, tumor cells may gain
resistance to immune attack by these additional mutations.
For example, a recent study showed that activation of the

MAPK pathway can elevate PDL1 expression in BrafV600E
inhibitor-resistant melanoma cells, which could dampen
T-cell activity and antitumor immunity (50). Interestingly, our
results showed that BrafV600E inhibition augmented PD1
expression on inﬁltrating T cells, and a similar observation
has been reported in humans (21). These ﬁndings raise the
possibility that intratumoral CD4 T cells might become more
sensitive to the PD1:PDL1 signaling pathways after vemurafenib treatment, which would support combining PD1 blockade with BrafV600E inhibitor treatment to inhibit tumor growth
or possibly delay resistance to BrafV600E inhibitors. It would be
an important issue for future studies to examine whether
CD40:CD40L and IFNg signaling would be diminished in
BrafV600E inhibitor-resistant melanoma and whether immunotherapies that provide these immune stimuli could be
utilized to treat BrafV600E inhibitor-resistant melanomas.
