ABSTRACT
The tumor microenvironment has been suggested to participate in tumorigenesis,
but the nature of the communication between cancer cells and the microenvironment,
especially in response to anticancer drugs, remains obscure. We determined that
activation of the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein delta (CEBPD) response to Cisplatin
and 5-Fluorouracil in cancer-associated macrophages and fibroblasts contributed to
the metastasis, invasion, acquired chemoresistance and stemness of cancer cells by
in vitro and in vivo assays. Specifically, reporter and in vivo DNA binding assays were
used to determine that Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a CEBPD responsive gene and serves
a protumor role upon anticancer drug treatment. Finally, a PTX3 peptide inhibitor
RI37 was developed and assessed the antitumor effects by in vivo assays. RI37
could function as a promising inhibitor for preventing cancer progression and the
metastasis, invasion and progression of drug-resistant cancers. The identification
of PTX3 provided a new insight in the interaction between host and tumor and the
RI37 peptide showed a great opportunity to largely reduce the risk of invasion and
metastasis of cancer and drug-resistant cancers.

INTRODUCTION

Previous studies have indicated that the tumor
microenvironment provides a protective niche for cancer
progression [1-4]. Clinical evidence also showed a strong
association between the number of tumor-associated
macrophages (TAMs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts
(CAFs) and poor prognosis in several types of cancer
[5-8]. TAMs are primarily a macrophage subpopulation
with an M2 phenotype [9] and the CAFs detected are
predominantly myofibroblasts [10], both of which
respond differently to various microenvironmental
signals and serve as a source of cytokines released
in the cancer-initiating cell microenvironment [11].
However, the responses of M2 macrophages/TAMs

Anticancer drug resistance is one of the major
challenges in cancer therapy. The majority of cancer
patients receive chemotherapy after surgical intervention.
However, even when chemotherapy appears successful,
cancer patients still face the risk of recurrence of the
same or a drug-resistant cancer. Therefore, understanding
the relationship between host and tumor may inform the
identification and design of more effective therapies to
overcome the spread or recurrence of cancer and improve
the outcome of cancer therapies.

and myofibroblasts/CAFs to anticancer drugs and the
consequent effects, including the metastasis, invasion,
acquired chemoresistance and stemness of cancer cells,
remain largely uninvestigated.
CEBPD belongs to the CCAAT/enhancer binding
protein (C/EBP) family of transcription factors. Under
normal physiological conditions, CEBPD is not highly
expressed, but it can be upregulated by a variety of
extracellular stimuli, including IL-1β, prostaglandin
E2 (PGE2) and TNFα [12-14]. CEBPD regulates or coregulates a wide range of inflammatory factors, such as
TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, CXCL1 [15], chemokines, monocyte
chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) and IL-10 [16, 17].
CEBPD is thought to function as a tumor suppressor in
cancer cells because the loss of CEBPD promotes tumor
progression [18]. Clinically, the silencing of CEBPD has
been observed in many cancers, including cervical cancer,
hepatocellular carcinoma, prostate cancer, leukemia and
breast cancer [15]. We previously demonstrated that the
polycomb group complex and DNA methyltransferase
mediated the hypermethylation of the CEBPD promoter
in cervical cancer cells [18]. Interestingly, a recent study
showed an increase in mammary tumor multiplicity and
a decrease in lung metastasis in Cebpd-/-/HER2/neu mice
[19]. This result is consistent with the possibility that
CEBPD acts as a tumor suppressor in cancer cells but may
contribute to invasion and metastasis in stromal cells in the
tumor microenvironment. Importantly, our study showed
that an increase in the CEBPD level in M2 macrophages in
response to PGE2 resulted in enhanced production of IL10 and PTX3 and had a protumor effect [17]. However, the
details of CEBPD biology in the tumor microenvironment,
as well as its biological impacts and potential application
in cancer therapy, remain largely unknown.
Pentraxins are a family of evolutionarily conserved
proteins that function at the crossroads between innate
immunity, inflammation, matrix deposition and female
fertility [20]. PTX3 consists of a C-terminal domain
similar to those of classical pentraxins, such as C-reactive
protein and serum amyloid P component, and an unrelated
N-terminal domain [21]. PTX3 synthesis is stimulated by
a variety of molecules that participate in the inflammatory
process, including LPS, IL-1β and TNFα [22, 23]. PTX3
is mainly composed of octamers that are covalently
linked by intra- and inter-chain disulfide bonds [24] and
glycosylation has been suggested to modulate PTX3
function during inflammation [23]. Previously, we
found that PTX3 is a downstream target of CEBPD in
macrophages and functions to reduce the macrophagemediated phagocytosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma
cells. Moreover, although a high PTX3 abundance has
been observed in the serum of several cancers, including
liposarcoma, prostate cancer, lung cancer and breast
cancer [25-27], the precise role of PTX3 in tumorigenesis
remains largely uninvestigated.
In this study, we elucidated the biology of the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

CEBPD response to anticancer drugs in cancer-associated
macrophages and fibroblasts. We found that activation
of CEBPD in the tumor microenvironment contributed
to the metastasis, invasion, acquired chemoresistance
and stemness of cancer cells. We next demonstrated
that PTX3, a gene that is directly regulated by CEBPD,
can fully support the protumor role of CEBPD in the
tumor microenvironment. We further developed a PTX3
inhibitor RI37 peptide to prevent CEBPD/PTX3 axisinduced cancer malignancies and reduce the metastasis
and invasion of drug-resistant cancers.

RESULTS
Activation of CEBPD in M2 macrophages and
myofibroblasts/CAFs contributes to the acquired
chemoresistance, stemness, migration and
invasion of cancer cells
The critical role of the microenvironment in cancer
progression and response to therapies, such as radiation
and anticancer drugs, is being increasingly recognized
[1, 2, 28-31]. However, the molecular components of the
interaction between cancer and host cells remain largely
uninvestigated. Importantly, as well as breast cancer cells
(Fig. S1), the transcription factor CEBPD was induced in
THP-1 M2-like macrophages (THP-1/M2), mouse M2
macrophages, HFL1 myofibroblasts (HFL1-MF) cells
and cancer associated fibroblast/F28 (CAF/F28) cells
upon treatment with Cisplatin (CDDP) or 5-Fluorouracil
(5-FU) (Figure. 1A). This observation prompted us to
examine whether anticancer drug-induced upregulation of
CEBPD in the tumor microenvironment contributed to the
stemness of cancer cells and to the metastasis and invasion
of anticancer drug-resistant cancer cells.
First, we found that conditioned media from
CEBPD-expressing THP-1/M2 or CAF/F28 cells
attenuated E-cadherin and increased N-cadherin, Twist1
and Snail2 transcripts in MDA-MB231 (MB231) cells
(Figure. 1B) and enhanced sphere formation of MB231
cells (Figure. 1C). Moreover, conditioned media from
CDDP- or 5-FU-treated THP-1/M2 or CAF/F28 cells
lacking CEBPD reverse the expression of EMT/stemness
markers and significantly inhibited this sphere-forming
ability in vitro (Figure. 1B and 1C) and tumorigenicity
in NOD/SCID mice (Figure. 1D). These results indicate
that increased expression of CEBPD in M2 macrophages
and myofibroblasts/CAFs contributes to the stemness of
cancer cells. We also assessed whether CEBPD in THP-1/
M2 cells and CAF/F28 cells contributed to the anticancer
drug resistance exhibited by cancer cells. We found that
MB231 cells were sensitized to CDDP and 5-FU when
they were cultured in conditioned media from THP-1/M2
or CAF/F28 cells lacking CEBPD (Figure. S2).

M2 or CAF/F28 cells regulated transcription of EMT (E-cadherin and N-cadherin) and cancer stem cell (Twist1 and Snail2) markers in

Next, following the generation of CDDP-resistant
mCherry fluorescent MB231 (mcCDRMB231), 5-FUresistant mCherry fluorescent MB231 (mcFURMB231),
CDDP-resistant mCherry fluorescent 4T1 (mcCDR4T1)
and 5-FU-resistant mCherry fluorescent 4T1 (mcFUR4T1)
cell lines (Figure. S3), we assessed the effect of anticancer
drug-induced CEBPD in M2 macrophages and CAFs on
the metastasis and invasion of drug-resistant cancer cells.
Conditioned medium from CEBPD-expressing THP1/M2 or CAF/F28 cells promoted the migration and
invasion of mcCDRMB231 cells (Figure. 2A). Moreover,
conditioned media from CDDP- or 5-FU-stimulated
THP-1/M2 cells, mouse M2 macrophages, HFL1-MF
cells and CAF/F28 cells also promoted the migration and
invasion of mcCDRMB231, mcFURMB231, mcCDR4T1
and mcFUR4T1 cells (Figure. 2B and Figure. S4A). In
contrast, these effects were attenuated when conditioned
medium from M2 macrophages or myofibroblasts/CAFs
lacking CEBPD was used (Figure. 2B and Figure. S4A).
We further assessed the in vivo effects of activated
CEBPD in stroma on the CDDP treatment of CDDPresistant cancer cells. First, mcCDRMB231 cells were
co-transplanted with THP-1/M2 cells carried control
knockdown vector (shC-M2MΦ) or CEBPD knockdown
vector (shD-M2MΦ) or CAF/F28 cells with control
knockdown vector (shC-CAF) or CEBPD knockdown
vector (shD-CAF) into NOD-SCID mice. After CDDP
treatment, the mcCDRMB231 cells co-transplanted
with shC-M2MΦ cells showed greater growth than
those co-transplanted with shD-M2MΦ (Figure. 2C
and 2D). Moreover, cancer growth was enhanced in
mcCDRMB231/shC-CAF co-transplants upon CDDP
treatment compared with mcCDRMB231/shD-CAF cotransplants (Figure. 2C and 2D). In agreement with the
results showing increased growth compared with THP1/M2 or CAF/F28 cells without CEBPD, the number
of metastatic and invasive mcCDRMB231 cells in the
lungs was increased in co-transplants with shC-M2MΦ
or shC-CAF cells upon CDDP treatment (Figure. 2E).
Next, mcCDR4T1 cells were co-transplanted with mouse
Cebpd+/+ or Cebpd-/- M2 macrophages or myofibroblasts
into NOD-SCID mice. After CDDP treatment,
mcCDR4T1 tumors were larger in size and showed greater
metastatic activity when co-transplanted with Cebpd+/+
M2 macrophages or myofibroblasts than co-transplants
with Cebpd-/- M2 macrophages or myofibroblasts (Figure.
S4B). These results suggest that drug-induced CEBPD
activation in the tumor microenvironment promotes the
migration and invasion of chemoresistant cancers.

preventing the macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of
tumor cells [17]. To further dissect the participation and
regulation of the PTX3 gene in response to CDDP and
5-FU in the tumor microenvironment, the expression of
PTX3 gene and the effects of the PTX3 were investigated,
respectively, by following in vitro and in vivo assays.
The PTX3 transcript and protein levels were significantly
increased in response to both CDDP and 5-FU in THP1/M2 and CAF/F28 cells (Figure. 3A and 3B). The
CDDP- and 5-FU-induced PTX3 reporter activities were
attenuated by the knockdown of CEBPD (Figure. 3C). An
in vivo DNA binding assay further showed that the binding
of CEBPD to the PTX3 promoter was induced upon CDDP
or 5-FU treatment (Figure. 3D). These results indicate
that CEBPD activates PTX3 transcription in response to
treatment with CDDP or 5-FU by directly binding to its
promoter region in M2 macrophages and CAFs.

PTX3 is involved in the CEBPD-induced acquired
chemoresistance, stemness and metastasis/
invasion of cancer cells
We found that the activation of CEBPD in M2like macrophages and CAFs contributed to stemness
and the migration and invasion of cancer cells that were
both susceptible and resistant to drugs. We further tested
whether PTX3 contributed to CEBPD-enhanced protumor
activity. Conditioned media from THP-1/M2 or CAF/
F28 cells lacking PTX3  could reverse the E-cadherin
transcripts but attenuated N-cadherin, Twist1 and Snail2
transcripts in MB231 cells (Figure. S5A). Moreover, the
conditioned media from THP-1/M2 or CAF/F28 cells
lacking PTX3 could decrease in vitro sphere-forming
ability and in vivo tumorigenicity in MB231 xenografted
NOD/SCID mice (Figure. 4A and 4B). It also increased
sensitivity of MB231 cells in response to CDDP and 5-FU
(Figure. S5B) and decreased the in vitro migration and
invasion of CDDP-treated mcCDRMB231 or 5-FU-treated
mcFURMB231 cells (Figure. 4C). We further assessed the
effects of PTX3 by examining in vivo tumor growth and
metastasis/invasion of mcCDRMB231 cells upon CDDP
treatment in a PTX3-enriched or depleted environment.
mcCDRMB231 cells were co-transplanted with THP-1/
M2 or CAF/F28 cells into NOD-SCID mice. Upon CDDP
treatment, the co-transplants that were stably expressing
the PTX3 knockdown vector (shP) were smaller and
exhibited less metastatic activity compared with cotransplants of mcCDRMB231 cells with shC-M2MΦ or
shC-CAF cells (Figure. 4D-4F). These results indicate that
activated PTX3 in M2 macrophages or CAFs promotes the
growth, metastasis and invasion of drug-resistant cancers.
The data also suggest that PTX3 could be a therapeutic
target for the development of a potent anticancer drug.

or without CDDP or 5-FU. C. mcCDRMB231 (MBR) cells were implanted into immunodeficient NOD-SCID mice. Stable THP-1/M2

subcutaneously co-inoculated with mcCDRMB231 (MBR) cells into NOD-SCID mice. The mice were treated with or without CDDP (5
mg/kg). Tumor size was measured with external calipers and tumor volume was calculated using the standard formula: V = (w x l2) x 0.52,
where l is the length and w is the width of the tumor (n=6 per group). The mice with mcCDRMB231-xenografted tumors in Figure 2C

all the above bvPTX3-induced phenomena (Figure. 5C5E). These results implied that glycosylation of PTX3
at Asn220 is critical for its protumor function. We next
synthesized the PTX3 peptides RI37 (amino acids 200236) and KT44 (amino acids 255-298) and tested their
antitumor effects (Figure. 6A). We found that RI37
suppressed the growth, metastasis and invasion of drugresistant cancers in vivo (Figure. 6B-6E). This study
implied that RI37 may be an antagonist of PTX3-enhanced
sphere-forming ability, anticancer-drug resistance,
migration and invasion of cancer cells.

The loss-of-function assay indicated that PTX3
contributed to CDDP- and 5FU-induced protumor effects
in drug-susceptible and resistant breast cancer cells,
respectively. In addition, a recent study showed that
glycosylation of Asn220 is important for PTX3 regulation
of inflammation and immunity [23, 32]. Recombinant
PTX3 proteins purified from insect cells (bvPTX3) has no
effect on the proliferation of MB231 cells (Figure. 5A and
5B), promotion of sphere-forming ability in vitro (Figure.
5C), enhancement of anticancer-drug resistance (Figure.

vitro (Figure. 5E). Importantly, the recombinant bvPTX3

CEBPD is induced by many inflammatory factors
and in turn contributes to the activation of many
inflammatory factors in macrophages [15, 33]. An
increase in mammary tumor multiplicity and a decrease
in lung metastasis were observed in HER2/neuTg

mice lacking CEBPD [19]. In the current study, we
demonstrated a novel function of CEBPD: the molecule
plays a protumor role in noncancerous cell types, such
as fibroblasts and macrophages, in the context of the
cancer microenvironment. Previously, CEBPD was
suggested to be involved in M1 macrophage polarization

[34]. Our preliminary data showed that the loss of
CEBPD attenuated the differentiation of both M1 and
M2 macrophages by verifying their macrophage markers
following differentiation by GM-CSF or M-CSF-treated
primary mouse monocytes (Ju-Ming Wang’s unpublished
results). The result indicated that CEBPD contributes
to both M1 and M2 macrophage differentiation but the
detailed regulation of CEBPD-mediated M1 and M2
macrophages needs to be further investigated. We showed
that the activation of CEBPD in M2 macrophages and
myofibroblasts/CAFs promoted sphere-forming ability
and the metastasis and invasion of both responsive and
drug-resistant cancers. Our data suggest that CEBPD plays
an important role in microenvironment-mediated cancer
progression. Our study also indicates that the dissection
of CEBPD biology in the tumor microenvironment could
suggest targets for developing anticancer reagents, such as
the RI37 peptides demonstrated here, that may be used for
cancer therapy in the future (Figure. 6F).
CAFs and TAMs increase tumor cell growth and
motility, ultimately facilitating cancer cell escape from
the primary tumor and thereby inducing metastatic
spread. Recently, chemotherapies directed against some
of these targets, which are overexpressed by breast
tumor cells as well as by TAMs and CAFs in a tumor
microenvironment, resulted in the elimination of tumor
growth, progression, metastasis and recurrence in mouse
tumor models. Previously, we suggested that PGE2activated CEBPD may play a protumor role in the tumor
microenvironment [17]. In this study, we found that
CEBPD was also activated by CDDP and 5-FU in TAM
and CAF cells (Figure. 1A). In addition to its functions
in immunosuppression and inhibition of cancer cell
phagocytosis by activated macrophages [17], we revealed
a novel CEBPD function in the tumor microenvironment,
namely, the promotion of sphere-forming ability,
metastasis and invasion of drug-resistant cancers in
CDDP- or 5-FU-treated TAMs and CAFs.
In response to extracellular stresses and
inflammatory
cytokines,
several
processes,
including induction of cell migration, angiogenesis,
immunosuppression and inhibition of phagocytosis, have
been observed and are associated with inflammation.
These inflammatory responses have also been linked to
the initiation of cancer and cancer progression and even
the occurrence of chemoresistance. However, the details of
this link largely remain unclear, especially the responses
associated with anticancer drug-induced inflammation-like
environments. Pentraxin family members are characterized
by a cyclic multimeric structure and contain a conserved
carboxy-terminal domain called a pentraxin domain. In
addition to its wide use as a marker of inflammation and
infection, PTX3 has been observed at increased levels in
several cancers, as mentioned previously. However, unlike
the well-studied involvement of other pentraxin members
in cancer [35, 36], the biology of PTX3 in cancer is less

well understood.
Interestingly, as well as bvPTX3, our preliminary
results showed that the recombinant PTX3 protein
purified from mammal cells (euPTX3) has no effect on the
proliferation of various cancer cells, but in agreement with
the above observations, euPTX3 promoted sphere-forming
ability in vitro, attenuated E-cadherin and increased
N-cadherin, Twist1 and Snail2 transcripts, increased drugresistance and migration and invasion of mcCDRMB231
cells in vitro. In addition, CD44 is also expressed in
various types of cancer cells and cancer stem cells. Early
observations have demonstrated a significant correlation
between CD44 and tumor recurrence and mortality. CD44
may be an indicator of tumors and metastasis in malignant
cancers [37, 38]. It has been speculated that PTX3 could
form a complex with TSG6 and CD44 [39]. However, the
involvement of CD44 in PTX3-induced tumorigenesis
remains further investigation. As shown in Fig. S6, as well
as mbvPTX3, RI37 has no direct effect on the growth of
cancer cells. However, RI37 could attenuate the growth
of xenografted cancers (Fig. 6B and 6C). The in vivo
result implies that PTX3 can play an autocrine/paracrine
role to stimulate pro-growth factor(s) from stromal cells
surrounding cancer cells.
In the current study, we further revealed involvement
of PTX3 in the tumor microenvironment in promoting
cancer metastasis, invasion and stemness. Our findings
not only describe the biological significance of PTX3 in
tumorigenesis but also suggest that PTX3 may be a key
pro-tumorigenic player in the tumor microenvironment. In
addition, the mutant bvPTX3 and RI37 further supported
this speculation. Recently, a group showed that PTX3
inhibited FGF/FGFR-driven EMT in human A375 and
A2058 melanoma cells [40]. They further demonstrated
that PTX3 was a potent FGF antagonist and was endowed
with anti-angiogensis and anti-neoplastic activity in mouse
prostate TRAMP-C2 cancer cells [41]. As well as MB231,
A549 and HONE1 cells, our results also showed that
euPTX3 promoted the migration and invasion of prostate
cancer PC3 and LNCaP cells (Figure. S7A and S7B).
Several recent studies mentioned above [25-27] and the
current study supported the protumor role of PTX3, we
still cannot rule out the possibility that the protumor role
of PTX3 may act in a cell line-, tumor- or species-specific
manner.
Patients with recurrent cancers, especially those with
anticancer drug-resistant cancers, are always at a higher
risk because these cancers always spread faster than the
original tumor. Nevertheless, the mechanisms related to
this issue are less understood and largely uninvestigated.
The activation of CEBPD induces apoptosis of cancer
cells [18, 42]. Comparing to the activation of CEBPD in
tumor-associated stromal cells, the activation of CEBPD
is insensitive in breast cancer cells because an epigeneticmediated hypermethylation on the promoter region of

cells) or 0.5% serum in DMEM medium (conditioned
medium from CAF/F28 cells) for another 24 h. Following
centrifugation, the supernatants were collected and stocked
for further assays in this study. For the gain-of-function
assay, conditioned medium was collected from THP-1/
M2 (M2MΦ) or CAF/F28 cells 24 h after infection with

promoter can attenuate the responses of CBEPD and
its downstream targets in cancer cells [18]. Insufficient
activation of CEBPD in cancer cells has been suggested to
induce genomic instability [14]. The current study further
supports our previous study [17] showing CEBPD serves
a protumor role in tumor microenvironment. Therefore,
the dual role of CEBPD in both killing and promoting
cancer has led us to think more about how to apply and
optimize “CEBPD reactivation” to provide a useful and
safe solution when administering these chemotherapeutic
drugs. The CEBPD downstream target PTX3 that we
focused on here can provide a great opportunity for
developing a feasible translational application for cancer
therapy.

Reporter plasmids and luciferase assay
The PTX3 reporter was constructed by cutting the
DNA fragment of the PTX3 promoter from pGL2-basic/
PTX3 [49] with KpnI and HindIII and subcloning the
fragment into the pGL3-basic vector. For the reporter
assay, cells were transiently transfected using the PTX3
reporter and indicated expression vectors with the
TransIT-2020 transfection reagent (Mirus) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Eighteen hours following
transfection, the transfectants were treated with CDDP or
5-FU for another 6 h. The lysates of experimental cells
were harvested to conduct the luciferase assay.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and treatment
THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium
(Hyclone). Human lung fibroblasts (HFL1) were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).
HFL1 cells were cultured in Ham’s F-12 Kaighn’s
Modification medium (Gibco). The CAF/F28 was
established from a patient [45]. Mouse embryo fibroblasts
(MEFs) used in this study were isolated from individual
E13.5-E14.5 embryos generated by mating Cebpd null
heterozygous mice and immortalized with E1A [46].
The CAF/F28 cells, human breast cancer MB231 cells,
mouse breast cancer 4T1 cells and immortalized Cebpd+/+
(7V7) and Cebpd–/– (KO5) MEFs were maintained in
DMEM. All culture media were supplemented with 10%
FBS, streptomycin and penicillin. To generate THP-1/
M2 macrophages, THP-1 cells were treated with 320
nM PMA for 6 h and then cultured with PMA plus 20
ng/ml IL-4 and 20 ng/ml IL-13 for another 18 h [47]. To
generate primary mouse M2 macrophages, mononuclear
cells obtained from bone marrow were treated with 25 ng/
ml M-CSF in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS [48].
To generate myofibroblasts, HFL1 cells or MEFs were
treated with 5 μg/ml TGF-β for 3 days. The following
concentrations of peptide were used in this study: 10 μg/
ml PTX3 peptide (RI37 or KT44). The anticancer drugs
were then added individually for each experiment: 40 μM
CDDP or 100 μM 5-FU.

ChIP assay
The ChIP assay was performed essentially as
described by Wang et al. [50]. Briefly, following
various treatments, the experimental THP-1/M2 or
CAF/F28 cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde.
The cross-linked chromatin was then prepared and
sonicated to an average size of 500 bp. The DNA
fragments were immunoprecipitated with antibodies
specific for CEBPD or control rabbit immunoglobulin
G at 4 °C overnight. After reversal of the cross-links,
the immunoprecipitated chromatin was amplified by
primers targeting specific regions of the gene’s genomic
locus. The primers used detected sequences in the PTX3
genomic locus (5’-GCTCGGATTGGACTTGACTT-3’
and 5’-GAGGGAAATGTGGAAGTTGC-3’). The
amplified DNA products were resolved by agarose gel
electrophoresis and confirmed by sequencing.

aprotinin (1 mg/ml) and leupeptin (1 mg/ml)]. Specific
antibodies including α-tubulin (T6199, Sigma) and
CEBPD (sc-636, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used
for Western blotting.

Cell viability assay
To assess the viability of cancer stem cells
in response to anticancer drugs using the MTT
[3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide] assay (Sigma), cancer cells were pretreated with
various conditioned media as described above with PTX3
peptide as indicated in each experiment for 7 days. Then,
1×104 experimental cells were treated with CDDP or 5-FU
for another 48 h. To assess the proliferation of cancer cells
using the MTT assay, cancer cells were treated with PTX3
peptides as indicated in each experiment for 24 and 48 h.

Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) assay
Lentiviruses were produced from Phoenix cells that
had been cotransfected with various shRNA expression
vectors in combination with pMD2.G and psPAX2.
After determining the viral infection efficiency, THP1/M2 and CAF/F28 cells were infected for 48 h with
shC, shD or shP lentiviruses, each at a multiplicity of
infection (MOI) of 10. The shRNA oligo sequences
used in the lentiviral expression vectors were as follows:
shC, 5′-CCGGTGTTCGCATTATCCGAACCATCTC
GAGATGGTTCGGATAATGCGAACATTTTTG-3′;
shD, 5′-CCGGGCTGTCGGCTGAGAACGAGAACT
CGAGTTCTCGTTCTCAGCCGACAGCTTTTT-3′; and
shP, 5′- CCGGGAGGAGCTCAGTATGTTTCATCTCGA
GATGAAACATACTGAGCTCCTCTTTTTTG-3′. The
lentiviral knockdown expression vectors were purchased
from the National RNAi Core Facility located at the
Genomic Research Center of the Institute of Molecular
Biology, Academia Sinica, Taiwan.

Migration assays and matrigel invasion assay
For the migration assay, cells were seeded (3 × 104
for mcMB231, mcCDRMB231 and mcFURMB231 cells
or 5 × 104 for mCherry fluorescent 4T1, mcCDR4T1 and
mcFUR4T1 cells) in 24-well plates containing 8-μm pore
inserts (BD Biosciences). For the matrigel invasion assay,
the 8-μm pore inserts of the 24-well plates were pre-coated
with appropriate matrigel and the same cell number as
mentioned in the migration assay were seeded onto the
matrigel. Serum-free conditioned medium was placed in
the upper wells after cells adhered to the inserts. DMEM
with 10% FBS was added to the lower wells of the 24well plates. The cells inside the insert were wiped with
cotton swabs and removed after 16 hours of incubation.
The cells that had migrated to the bottom of the insert
membrane were detected by DAPI. The total number of
cells attached to the lower surface of the polycarbonate
filter insert was counted at 200X magnification under a
fluorescence microscope.

Sphere formation assay
Cancer cells were cultured with conditioned medium
as described above. Then, cells were plated in ultralow
attachment plates (Corning) at a density of 5x103 cells
per well. Cells were grown in serum-free DMEM/F12
(Gibco) supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), 20 ng/mL
EGF (Abcam) and 10 ng/mL bFGF (Peprotech). After two
weeks, the total number of spheres was counted at 100X
magnification under a microscope.

Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR)
Total RNA of experimental cells was isolated using
TRIzol RNA extraction reagent. For RT-PCR analysis,
total RNA was subjected to reverse transcription with
SuperScript III (Invitrogen). The specific oligonucleotide
primers used for the RT-PCR analysis are as follows:
