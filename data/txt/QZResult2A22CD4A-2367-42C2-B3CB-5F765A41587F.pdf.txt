ABSTRACT:
It has been demonstrated that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) can have
kinase independent activity. EGFR kinase-independent function maintains intracellular
glucose levels via sodium glucose transporter protein 1 (SGLT1) and supports cell
survival.  It is plausible that this phenomenon can apply to other receptor tyrosine
kinases. We found that transfection of insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R)
siRNA into HEK293 (human embryonic kidney) and MCF7 (metastatic breast cancer)
cells results in decreased intracellular glucose levels, whereas treatment with the
IGF-1R tyrosine kinase inhibitor OSI-906 did not affect intracellular glucose levels. In
addition, IGF-1R interacted with SGLT1 in a manner similar to that previously reported
with EGFR. The combination of IGF-1R siRNA and OSI-906 resulted in decreased
viability of HEK293 and MCF7 cell lines compared to either agent alone. Collectively,
these experiments suggest that IGF-1R, has kinase-independent biologic functions
and provide a rationale for combining anti-IGF-1R antibodies or siRNA and IGF-1R
small molecule inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION

through both kinase-dependent and kinase-independent
pathways.[15, 16]. For instance, down-regulation of
EGFR expression with small interfering (si) RNA resulted
in a decrease in intracellular glucose levels, and induction
of autophagy, as well as an increase in the sub-G1
population in metastatic prostate cancer cells.[16-18].
These observations have important clinical implications as
they suggest that mitigating EGFR signaling may require
a combination of small molecule (kinase) inhibitors and
antibodies (or siRNA). Indeed, synergy between an EGFR
kinase inhibitor and an antibody has been demonstrated in
preclinical models, and is being tested in the clinic.[19-23]
It is plausible that this phenomenon may not be unique
to EGFR and can apply to other transmembrane kinase
receptors. In our study, we explored whether IGF-1R also
demonstrated kinase-independent activity similar to that
found with EGFR.

Insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) signaling is an important metabolic pathway in
cancer.[1] IGF-1R inhibitors have shown promise in
the clinic in several different malignancies, including
Ewing’s sarcoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, and
adrenocortical carcinoma.[2-5] Both anti-IGF-1R
antibodies and small molecules directed against the kinase
activity of IGF-1R are being assessed in clinical trials.[4,
6-13] Anti-IGF-1R antibodies down-regulate cell-surface
IGF-1R, thereby preventing signaling through IGF-1R.
Small molecule kinase inhibitors, such as OSI-906, inhibit
the phosphorylation and downstream signaling of IGF-1R.
[14] While these molecules target two distinct points in
the IGF-1 signaling pathway, the end result is thought to
be the same, i.e. down-regulation of signaling through
IGF-1R.

growth factor receptor (EGFR) and other kinases signal

RESULTS

IR. Total IGF-1R remains constant following OSI-906
treatment in both cell lines, while p-Akt and p-IGF-1R are
decreased in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1b).

IGF-1R siRNA decreases total IGF-1R, p-IGF-1R,
and p-Akt

IGF-1R siRNA decreases intracellular glucose
levels

HEK293 and MCF7 cells, which both express high
levels of IGF-1R, were transfected with siRNA against
IGF-1R, and Western blotting was performed to confirm
the effect of down-regulation of IGF-1R siRNA on p-IGF1R and p-Akt.[24, 25]. IGF-1R siRNA decreased the
expression of total IGF-1R and p-IGF-1R in both cells
lines (Figure 1a.), and phosphorylation of the downstream
effector Akt was inhibited in HEK293 cells. In MCF7
cells, Akt phosphorylation was not downregulated despite
a decrease in total and p-IGF-1R levels, most likely
because Akt activation is induced in these cells via both
IGF-1R and the insulin receptor (IR).[24]. Transfection
with EGFR siRNA served as a control for the specificity
of IGF-1R siRNA. GAPDH siRNA served as a positive
control for transfection (Figure 1a).

Previously, transfection of EGFR siRNA into
metastatic prostate cancer cells resulted in decreased
intracellular glucose levels, whereas treatment with an
EGFR kinase inhibitor did not affect intracellular glucose.
[16]. GLUT is a facilitative glucose transporter, and
SGLT1 is an active glucose transporter (sodium/glucose
cotransporter [SGLT]). These proteins allow glucose
to move into and out of a cell.[26, 27] HEK293 and
MCF7 cells were transfected with non-targeted, IGF1R, SGLT1, or GLUT siRNA, and intracellular glucose
levels were measured (Figures 2a and 2b). In both cell
lines, intracellular glucose decreased significantly after
transfection with IGF-1R siRNA. This was demonstrated
in HEK293 at low/physiological extracellular glucose
levels (5 mM), and was reversible at high (25 mM)
glucose levels (Figure 2a). In MCF7 cells, transfection of
IGF-1R siRNA decreased intracellular glucose levels at
both physiological and high glucose levels (Figure 2b),
but was more pronounced at low glucose levels. SGLT1
and GLUT siRNA also decreased intracellular glucose
concentrations in both cell lines, and like IGF-1R siRNA,
the effect was only seen at low extracellular glucose
concentrations in HEK293, and was less pronounced in
MCF7 cells.

OSI-906 decreases p-IGF-1R and p-Akt
OSI-906 is a dual kinase inhibitor that inhibits both
IGF-1R and IR signaling. MCF7 cells express both IGF1R and IR (and also IR-A, the fetal isoform of IR).[24]
Hence, IGF-1R siRNA was not sufficient to decrease
p-Akt in MCF7 cells, but OSI-906 was (Figure 1b). This
is consistent with data in the literature suggesting that
Akt activation in MCF7 cells involves both IGF-1R and

p-IGF-1R in HEK293 and MCF7 cells, and p-Akt in HEK293 cells. Cells were transfected with 100 nM siRNA for 48 hours, then lysed for
Western blot analysis using appropriate antibodies. EGFR siRNA was used as a control for the specificity of IGF-1R siRNA, and GAPDH
siRNA was used as a positive control for transfection. (b) The small molecule kinase inhibitor, OSI-906, inhibits phosphorylation of IGF1R and Akt in HEK293 and MCF7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Total IGF-1R levels remain unchanged. Cells were treated for 48
hours, then lysed for Western blotting. GAPDH was used as a loading control. Blots are representative of at least three experiments.

In contrast to IGF-1R siRNA, OSI-906 did not
decrease intracellular glucose levels under any conditions
(low 5mM, medium 17 mM, or high 25 mM extracellular
glucose) when tested at concentrations up to 1 uM (Figure
2c). Concentrations of 50 nM OSI-906 demonstrated
complete (MCF7) or near complete (HEK293) inhibition
of IGF-1R kinase activity (Figure 1b), but intracellular
glucose levels remained unchanged. These results are
analogous to those obtained with EGFR siRNA versus
EGFR kinase inhibitors, and indicate that inhibition of
the kinase domain of IGF-1R has no effect on the levels
of intracellular glucose in either cell line, while downregulation of total IGF-1R decreases intracellular glucose.
[16]

performed immuno-precipitation followed by Western blot
analysis to determine if IGF-1R and SGLT1 also interact
endogenously in our cell lines (Figure 3a). When HEK293
or MCF7 cell lysates were immuno-precipitated with antiSGLT1 and Western blotted with anti-IGF-1R, a strong
band appeared (Figure 3a, top, lane 2). This was also true
when the antibodies were reversed (Figure 3a, bottom,
lane 2). GLUT, however, does not appear to interact
with IGF-1R or EGFR (Figure 3a, top and middle panels,
lane 3). Cell lysates were immuno-precipitated with antiEGFR and Western blotted with anti-SGLT1 as a positive
control for interaction with SGLT1 (Figure 3a, bottom,
lane 3).[16]. In addition to immuno-precipitation/Western
blot, interaction of IGF-1R and SGLT-1 was implicated
by experiments in which transfection of both cell lines
with IGF-1R siRNA also resulted in a decrease in SGLT1
protein expression, whereas non-targeted siRNA did not
have this effect (Figure 3b, compare lanes 3 and 4). This
is similar to results obtained for EGFR in that downregulation of total EGFR by siRNA transfection resulted
in decreased expression of SGLT1 at the protein level.

IGF-1R and SGLT1 interact in HEK293 and MCF7
cells
In the paper by Weihua et al., EGFR interacted with
SGLT1, but not with GLUT, in PC3MM2 cells.[16] We

IGF-1R, SGLT, and GLUT siRNA significantly decreased intracellular glucose levels in HEK293 cells cultured in low/physiologic (5mM)
glucose DMEM, but not in high (25 mM) glucose DMEM. (b) IGF-1R, SGLT, and GLUT siRNA significantly decreased intracellular
glucose levels in MCF7 cells cultured in low glucose, and to a lesser extent in high glucose. (c) Intracellular glucose levels were not
significantly affected by OSI-906 (10-50 nM) in either cell line in low, medium (17 mM), or high (25 mM) glucose DMEM. All experiments
were repeated at least three times and significance determined by student’s t test.

induced to increase LC3II expression (Figure 4a and 4b,
right panels) even though MCF7 lacks beclin1, a protein
important to the autophagic process.[28, 29]. Results were
confirmed by Western blot (Figure 4c and 4d). Therefore,
unlike EGFR, IGF-1R down-regulation did not result in
autophagy in these two cell lines. Interestingly, OSI-906
actually decreased the level of LC3II by Western blotting
in both cell lines. This result was seen consistently in at
least four experiments, indicating that OSI-906 may in fact
inhibit autophagy in these cells. Cell cycle analysis was
also performed to determine if IGF-1R siRNA increased
the sub-G1 population (dead/apoptotic cells) as was
found for EGFR. Results showed that IGF-1R siRNA
did not increase the sub-G1 population in either cell line
(Supplementary Figure 1).

IGF-1R down-regulation does not result in
autophagy in HEK293 and MCF7 cells
Since siRNA against EGFR was found to induce
autophagic cell death in PC3MM2 cells, we asked whether
this was unique to EGFR or if down-regulation of IGF-1R
by siRNA could also induce autophagy.[16]. Autophagy
typically occurs when the cell is under environmental
stress, such as nutrient deprivation, or pathogen infection,
and is used to degrade and recycle proteins and organelles
as a means of survival, and may result in increased or
decreased cell death depending on the circumstances.
[17, 18]. Autophagy induction was a possibility since
levels of intracellular glucose were decreased by IGF-1R
siRNA transfection in a manner similar to that observed
for EGFR.[16]. However, IGF-1R siRNA did not induce
autophagy in either HEK293 or MCF7 cells. Cells were
transfected with non-targeted or IGF-1R siRNA and then
immuno-stained for the presence of isoform II of the
autophagic protein, microtubule-associated protein 1 light
chain 3 (LC3II) (Figure 4a and 4b). Cells were analyzed
by flow cytometry. LC3B isoform II typically increases
in cells that are undergoing autophagy. Neither IGF-1R
siRNA nor OSI-906 induced autophagy in either cell line.
MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, was used as a positive
inducer of autophagy to show that both cell lines can be

IGF-1R siRNA decreases the viability of HEK293
and MCF7 cells alone and in combination with
OSI-906
We next determined whether IGF-1R siRNA and
OSI-906 affected the viability of the cells either alone
or in combination. Cells treated with 0.1% DMSO were
assigned 100% viability and were used as a negative
(vehicle) control. Cells treated with media alone were
virtually identical to DMSO only treated cultures. Prior
to assessing the effect on viability, the IC50 of OSI-906
on both cell lines was determined (approximately 3 uM

with IgG isotypic control, anti-SGLT1, anti-GLUT, or anti-IGF-1R plus protein A/G beads. Immuno-precipitated extracts were run on an
8% SDS-PAGE gel, immuno-blotted, and probed with anti-IGF-1R, anti-EGFR, or anti-SGLT1. Experiment shown is representative of at
least three experiments. Arrows indicate the interaction. (b) HEK293 and MCF7 cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO), 1 uM OSI-906,

of SGLT1 (lane 4), whereas OSI-906 has no effect on the expression of SGLT1. GAPDH served as a loading control.

for HEK293 at 96 hours and 500-750 nM for MCF7 at
96 hours and 1 uM for MCF7 at 72 hours). Hence all
viability and apoptosis experiments were carried out at 1
uM OSI-906 at 72 or 96 hours. A cell viability assay was
used to measure the number of viable cells present based
on quantification of ATP, which signals the presence of
metabolically active cells. The amount of ATP is directly
proportional to the number of cells present in culture
(see Materials and Methods). Cells were either treated
with DMSO as a control (100% viability) or DMSO
plus non-targeted siRNA, DMSO plus IGF-1R siRNA,
OSI-906 alone, OSI-906 plus non-targeted siRNA, or
OSI-906 plus IGF-1R siRNA. Treatment with 1 uM
OSI-906 significantly decreased the viability of HEK293
and MCF7 cells by approximately 26% (p<0.05) and
50% (p<0.001), respectively, at 72 hours and by 30%
(p<0.05) and 52% (p<0.001), respectively, at 96 hours
(Figure 5, compare bars A and B). Hence, OSI-906 was

more effective at decreasing the viability of MCF7 cells
than the viability of HEK293 cells at 1 uM. These data
correlate with the previously calculated IC50 for each
cell line. IGF-1R siRNA alone decreased the viability
of HEK293 and MCF7 cells by 28% (p<0.05) and 10%
(p<0.05), respectively, at 72 hours and 40% (p<0.05) and
15% (p<0.05) at 96 hours (Figure 5, compare bars A and
E). Hence, down-regulation of total IGF-1R by siRNA
transfection resulted in a statistically significant decrease
in the viability of HEK293 cells and MCF7 cells at both
time points. Cells were also transfected with non-targeted
siRNA as a negative control. There was a non-specific
decrease in the viability of both cell lines following
transfection of non-targeted siRNA, but this was not
statistically significant (Figure 5, compare bars A and C).
The inhibitory effect of OSI-906 alone compared
with IGF-1R siRNA alone varied with the cell line and the
amount of time of culture. In HEK293 cells, OSI-906 and

HEK293 and MCF7 cells were transfected with non-targeted or IGF-1R siRNA for 48 hours (top panels, a. and b.) or treated with 1 uM
OSI-906 for 48 hours (lower panels, a. and b.). Cells were washed in PBS and immuno-stained with primary anti-LC3B antibody, then
stained with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody and subjected to FACS analysis. An IgG antibody was used as an isotypic control (light

isoforms I and II were also analyzed by Western blotting following transfection of HEK293 (c) and MCF7 (d) with siRNA or treatment with
1 uM OSI-906 for 48 hrs. GAPDH expression served as a loading control. NT = non-targeted siRNA.

IGF-1R siRNA did not differ in their ability to decrease
viability at 72 hours, but IGF-1R siRNA was more
effective than OSI-906 if cultured for 96 hours (Figure
5a and 5b, compare bars B and E). In MCF7 cells, OSI906 was much more effective (p<0.001, Figure 5c and 5d,
compare A and B) than IGF-1R siRNA (p<0.05, Figure
5c and 5d, compare A and E) at decreasing viability at 72
and 96 hours (compare bars B and E), with an enhanced
decrease at 96 hours (Figure 5c and 5d)
If IGF-1R has both kinase-dependent and kinaseindependent effects, and if these effects are pertinent to
cell viability, then the combination of IGF-1R siRNA
plus OSI-906 would be expected to decrease the viability
of both cell lines more than either agent alone. Figure 5
shows the effect on the viability of HEK293 and MCF7
cells treated with the combination of OSI-906 plus IGF-1R
siRNA. Comparison of OSI-906 alone to treatment with
OSI-906 plus IGF-1R siRNA (Figure 5, bar B compared

to bar F) shows a significant enhancement of the effects of
OSI-906 in both cell lines after transfection with IGF-1R
siRNA at 72 hours and even more so at 96 hours (HEK293
p<0.05 at 72 hours, p<0.001 at 96 hours; MCF7 p<0.05 at
72 hours, p<0.001 at 96 hours). Alternatively, comparison
of DMSO plus IGF-1R siRNA (essentially IGF-1R
siRNA alone) to OSI-906 plus IGF-1R siRNA (Figure 5,
compare bar E to bar F) also shows a significant decrease
in viability of both cell lines at 72 hours (HEK293 p<0.05,
MCF7 p<0.001) and 96 hours (HEK293 p<0.05, MCF7
p<0.001). Comparing OSI-906 plus non-targeted siRNA
to OSI-906 plus IGF-1R siRNA (Figure 5 compare bar D
and F) shows that IGF-1R siRNA is significantly better
than non-targeted siRNA when combined with OSI-906 in
HEK293 cells at 72 hours (p<0.05) and MCF7 at 96 hours
(p<0.001), and shows a trend toward significance in MCF7
cells at 72 hours (p=0.07). A significant difference between
the two siRNAs was not seen in HEK293 cells at 96 hours,

perhaps because the S.E.M. was larger for this time point.
Therefore, these results suggest that the combination of
the kinase inhibitor OSI-906 and siRNA against IGF-1R
has significantly greater suppressive effects on HEK293
and MCF7 viability than either agent alone, though these
effects are more pronounced at certain time points.

such as erlotinib, results in synergistic tumor regression.
[19-21]. We therefore asked whether a kinase-independent
signal could be observed with other clinically relevant
growth factor receptors, such as IGF-1R. Indeed, recent
literature suggests that IGF-1R translocates to the nucleus
where it is thought to be involved in the transcriptional
enhancement of specific target genes, while the kinase
domain of IGF-1R is responsible for interaction with
other kinases and the activation of intracellular signaling
pathways that result in increased proliferation.[30-36]
Our data demonstrate that siRNA directed against
total IGF-1R decreases intracellular glucose levels in
both HEK293 (human embryonic kidney) and MCF7
(metastatic breast cancer) cell lines, particularly at
physiological levels of glucose (5 mM). Higher levels
of extracellular glucose can partially attenuate this effect
(Figure 2a and b). OSI-906, a small molecule inhibitor
of the IGF-1R kinase, did not alter intracellular glucose
levels. In addition, IGF-1R was found to interact with
the sodium glucose transporter protein SGLT1 in a
manner similar to that seen with EGFR. Hence, IGF-1R
(like EGFR) may play a role in maintaining intracellular
glucose levels in tumor cells in a kinase-independent
manner.
In contrast to EGFR, blocking total IGF-1R
expression by siRNA transfection did not increase the
sub-G1 (dead) cell population, nor did it induce autophagy
or apoptosis in either cell line following inhibition of IGF1R expression; however, decreased intracellular glucose
levels are not always a prerequisite for autophagy.[37]
Even so, the combination of OSI-906 plus IGF-1R siRNA
resulted in a greater decrease in cell viability in both cell
lines than with either molecule alone (Figure 5). This may
have clinical implications in that it suggests that giving an
IGF-1R antibody or siRNA together with OSI-906 may be
more effective than either agent alone. Of interest, Zeng et
al. demonstrated an increase in autophagy in breast cancer
cell line models (MCF-7, LCC6) sequentially exposed
to doxorubicin and IGF-1R/IR tyrosine kinase inhibitor;
however, autophagy in these experiments could have been
activated by doxorubicin rather than IGF-1R inhibition.
[38]
The case for using a monoclonal antibody and a
kinase inhibitor together is being studied in the clinic.
[22, 23]. We recently demonstrated that 11 of 34 patients
(32.4%) achieved stable disease for at least six months
and/or a partial/complete response with the use of the
EGFR kinase inhibitor erlotinib combined with the
EGFR antibody cetuximab.[39]. Others have shown that
combining the HER2/neu kinase inhibitor lapatinib with a
HER2/neu antibody trastuzumab prolonged progressionfree survival in patients with HER2/neu positive breast
cancer.[40, 41]. Our current results suggest that a similar
strategy may be exploitable with IGF-1R inhibition.
There are limitations to this study. For instance,
OSI-906 inhibits insulin receptor kinase as well as IGF-1R

OSI-906 and IGF-1R siRNA do not induce
apoptosis or increase the sub-G1 population in
HEK293 or MCF7 cells
EGFR siRNA increased the subG1 population in
transfected metastatic prostate cancer cells [14]. Hence,
we treated our cell lines with OSI-906 alone, IGF-1R
siRNA alone, or the combination and performed cell
cycle analysis. As stated above, there was no significant
increase in the subG1 population in either cell line after
treatment with OSI-906 or IGF-1R siRNA (Supplementary
Figure 1). FITC-Annexin V staining was also performed
to determine if our cell lines were undergoing apoptosis
after treatment with OSI-906 alone or in combination
with IGF-1R siRNA. Baseline levels of apoptosis were
slightly higher in MCF7 cells (22%). Treatment of MCF7
with OSI-906 induced only a slight increase in apoptosis
(4%) over baseline, and the combination of OSI-906 plus
IGF-1R siRNA resulted in a 7% increase in apoptosis
compared to OSI-906 alone (not significant by Student’s t
test, Supplementary Figure 2). Baseline levels of apoptosis
were lower in HEK293 cells (10%) and increased to
approximately 18% after treatment with OSI-906 alone
and increased to only 20% with the combination (not
statistically significant by Student’s t test, Supplementary
Figure 3). Neither OSI-906, IGF-1R siRNA, nor the
combination significantly induced apoptosis in MCF7
and HEK293 cells. Together, these data indicate that the
combination of OSI-906 and IGF-1R siRNA inhibits
proliferative pathways, but does not induce apoptotic cell
death in the cell lines studied.

DISCUSSION
Receptor kinases can signal through more than
one pathway. For example, CRAF was found to have
an MEK-independent role, which is critical for mitosis
and tumor progression.[15]. In addition, Weihua et al.
[16] demonstrated that siRNA directed against EGFR
resulted not only in the down-regulation of total EGFR,
but also in a decrease in intracellular glucose levels, the
induction of autophagic cell death, and an increase in
the sub-G1 population. These results were not observed
when EGFR kinase activity was inhibited, consistent
with the presence of a kinase-independent EGFR signal.
Additional preclinical data examining EGFR includes
animal models showing that the combination of antiEGFR antibodies plus EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors,

kinase. It is therefore possible that the more pronounced
decrease in cell viability observed when it was combined
with siRNA against IGF-1R could be due to the effects on
the insulin receptor itself. Still, these results suggest that
such a combination in the clinic may be worth examining.
In summary, we show that IGF-1R, like EGFR,
demonstrates a kinase-independent function. The kinaseindependent activity is related to the interaction of
IGF-1R with the sodium glucose transporter SGLT1;
indeed, down-regulation of IGF-1R suppresses SGLT1,
thereby attenuating glucose levels. Unlike EGFR,
down-regulation of IGF-1R by siRNA does not result in
increased autophagy. However, cell viability is decreased
and, furthermore, combining the kinase inhibitor OSI-906
with siRNA against IGF-1R amplifies the suppression of
viability, albeit without a significant pro-apoptotic effect.
These observations suggest that combining an IGF-1R
siRNA (or antibody) with OSI-906 is warranted in the
clinical setting. Finally, experiments are underway to
determine if other tyrosine kinase receptors also have
kinase-independent functions.

siRNA transfection was performed to determine the
effect of down-regulating IGF-1R and other molecules
on cell signaling, survival, autophagy, apoptosis, and
intracellular glucose levels. HEK293 (2.5x105) or MCF7
(5x105) cells were seeded per well of a 6 well plate and
transfected with DharmaFECT 1 siRNA lipid transfection
reagent alone (Dharmacon, Pittsburgh, PA), non-targeted
siRNA (siGENOME non-targeting siRNA #1), IGF-1R,
EGFR, SGLT, GLUT, or GAPDH siRNA (control) for 48
hours. Following transfection, cell lysates were harvested
for Western blot analysis, prepared for an intracellular
glucose assay, analyzed by fluorescence activated cell
sorter (FACS) analysis, or harvested for viability assay.

Intracellular glucose assay
Intracellular glucose levels were measured
following transfection of cells with IGF-1R siRNA or
treatment with OSI-906 to determine the effects of IGF-1R
down-regulation or inhibition of IGF-1R tyrosine kinase
activity on intracellular glucose levels. 1x104 cells per mL
were lysed in Western blotting solubilization buffer and
mixed with assay reagent (1.5 mM NAD, 1.0 mM ATP,
1.0 unit/mL of hexokinase, and 1.0 unit/mL of glucose-6phosphate dehydrogenase) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Glucose [HK] assay kit, Sigma, St. Louis,
MO). When glucose is phosphorylated by ATP, an
equimolar amount of NAD is reduced to NADH. The
consequent increase in absorbance at 340 nm of the lysate
is directly proportional to glucose concentration.

(breast adenocarcinoma) cell lines were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas,
VA), and were authenticated by short tandem repeat
analyses. Both cell lines were maintained in Eagle’s
Minimal Essential medium (EMEM) (ATCC) plus 10%
fetal calf serum (FCS) and maintained in a 37oC incubator
with 5% CO2. For cultures grown in low (5mM) or high
(25 mM) glucose, HyClone low or high glucose DMEM
were used, respectively (LabSource, Romeoville, IL).

Immuno-precipitation and Western blotting
Immuno-precipitation followed by Western blotting
was performed to determine if there was a physical
interaction between IGF-1R and glucose transporter
proteins. For Western blots, cells were washed with
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in 1x RIPA
Lysis Buffer (Millipore) plus protease inhibitors. A
modified Lowry protein assay was performed (Pierce
Biotechnology, Rockford, IL), and equal amounts of
protein were loaded onto 7.5-10% SDS-PAGE gels, and
then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting. Blots were blocked in 5.0% non-fat milk,
incubated with primary antibody (22oC for 2 hours),
washed, and then incubated with an appropriate secondary
antibody conjugated to HRP and detected by enhanced
chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech,
Piscataway, NJ). For immuno-precipitation experiments,
cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Pierce Biotechnology).
500-1000 ug per lane of lysate was pre-cleared with an
isotypic control (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (4oC for 2

Antibodies and reagents
Primary antibodies used for Western blotting
included rabbit polyclonal or murine monoclonal
antibody against IGF-1R, phosphorylated (p)-IGF-1R
(Tyr 1135/1136), Light Chain 3B (LC3B), EGFR, Akt, and
p-Akt (ser 473) (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), glucose
transporter (GLUT1), SGLT1 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA
and Millipore, Billerica, MA), and GAPDH (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Secondary antibodies
for Western blotting included anti-rabbit (Cell Signaling)
and anti-mouse (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA)
conjugated to horse radish peroxidise (HRP). OSI-906 was
purchased from ChemieTek (Indianapolis, IN). Glucose
stock (225 mM) was prepared (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
and diluted with culture media.

hours), then incubated with specific antibody plus protein
A/G beads (2-4 hours at 4oC), centrifuged, washed 4X with
RIPA buffer, resuspended in 2X sample buffer (BioRad),
and boiled before loading onto SDS-PAGE gels.

was measured by staining cell-surface phosphatidyl serine
with FITC-conjugated Annexin V. 2.5x105 HEK293 and
5x105 MCF7 cells were seeded per well of a six-well
plate and treated for 72 hours, harvested, and stained with
FITC-Annexin V and propidium iodide according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (BD Pharmingen). Cells were
analyzed using fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS)
analysis (Becton Dickinson).

Analysis of autophagy by LC3B staining and flow
cytometry
To determine if cells were undergoing autophagy,
levels of the autophagosomal protein LC3B isoform II
were measured by staining the cells with an anti-LC3B
antibody, and then analyzing by flow cytometry. HEK293
(2.5x105) and MCF7 (5x105) cells were transfected with
the appropriate siRNA or treated with DMSO (vehicle) or
OSI-906 for 48 hours, washed in PBS, and fixed by adding
2-4% formaldehyde solution for 10 minutes at 37oC.
Cells were then permeabilized by adding ice-cold 100%
methanol to pre-chilled cells to a final concentration of
90% and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. 0.5-1x106 cells
per tube were washed twice in 0.5% bovine serum albumin
(BSA) in PBS. Cells were blocked in 0.5% BSA for 10
minutes at room temperature (RT). Primary antibody (antiLC3B) was added at a 1:500 dilution and incubated for 1
hour at RT, then washed with 0.5% BSA. FITC-conjugated
secondary antibody (1:1,000) was added and cells were
incubated for 30 minutes at RT, washed, and resuspended
in 0.5 mL PBS and analyzed by fluorescence activated cell
sorter (FACS) analysis (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA).

Cell cycle analysis
Cell cycle analysis was performed to determine if
there was an increase in the sub-G1(dead cell) population
following transfection with IGF-1R siRNA or treatment
with OSI-906. Cells were fixed in 100% ethanol
and stained with propidium iodide, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (BD Pharmingen), and then
analyzed using FACS analysis.

Statistical analysis
Student’s t-test was used to assess the association
between continuous variables. All tests were two-sided,
and P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically
significant. If not otherwise indicated, error bars in all
experiments represent standard deviation error (SE).
All statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS 19
computer software (SPSS Chicago, IL).

Viability assay

Conflict of interest

Viability of the cells was assessed after treating the
cells with OSI-906, IGF-1R siRNA, or the combination.
500 HEK293 or 1x103 MCF7 cells were plated per well
of an opaque-walled 96-well plate. The CellTiter-Glo®
Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega, Madison,
WI) was used to measure the number of viable cells
present based on quantification of ATP, which signals the
presence of metabolically active cells. The amount of ATP
is directly proportional to the number of cells present in
culture. The assay was performed at RT as described in
the manufacturer’s instructions. Background luminescence
from wells containing media alone was subtracted from
experimental wells. 100 uL of CellTiter-Glo ® Reagent
was added per well containing 100 uL of culture medium.
Contents were mixed on an orbital shaker for 2 minutes
to induce cell lysis, and the plate was incubated at RT for
10 minutes to stabilize the luminescent signal. Plates were
read on a BioTek Synergy 4 plate reader (Winooski, VT).
