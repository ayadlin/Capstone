BACKGROUND: The p53 antisense oligonucleotide cenersen has been shown to sensitize acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) stem cells to DNA damaging agents. METHODS: To determine whether cenersen merits testing in larger efficacy studies, an exploratory study of cenersen in combination with idarubicin either alone or with 1 of 2 doses of
cytarabine was performed in first-salvage AML patients. Patients who either had failed to respond to a single induction course or had responded to induction but relapsed within 12 months were enrolled. Stopping rules based on an
expected 14% complete response (CR) rate were applied to each treatment arm. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients were
treated, and none of the arms was terminated for lack of activity. Nearly all patients received a single course unless
they responded. Ten of the 53 (19%) patients responded (8 CR and 2 CR with incomplete platelet recovery). There
was a positive trend for a better response rate with increasing intensity of chemotherapy in the patients refractory to
front-line treatment compared with those who had relapsed previously. One-third (17/53) of the patients received
cenersen inhibitors (acetaminophen and/or high dose antioxidants) during treatment, and none of these responded
to treatment. No unique toxicity was attributed to cenersen. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggested that
the combination of cenersen with chemotherapy may have clinical efficacy, and additional studies are warranted to

INTRODUCTION
The normal function of p53 includes protection from the effects of DNA damage and/or proto-oncogene activation by
directing defective cells to undergo either p53-dependent programmed cell death (both stimuli) or p53-dependent cell
cycle arrest and repair (DNA damage only).1 Consequently, if a premalignant cell is to progress to a full malignant phenotype, it must inhibit p53-dependent programmed cell death.2-5 In contrast, p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and repair
function appear to be frequently retained in cancer cells with wild-type p53.1,6,7 When p53 mutates, this protective function is lost but can be compensated for via gain-of-function mutant p53.8-11
Cenersen is an antisense oligonucleotide that blocks the production of both wild-type and mutant p53 to produce
anticancer effects.12-14 It has a ribonuclease H (RNase H)–dependent mechanism of action that causes the p53 messenger
RNA to be cleaved at the site to which cenersen binds.14 In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), cenersen has preferential activity against the malignant stem cells and some of the more mature progenitor cells, probably because they express high levels of RNase H.15-17 Cenersen sensitizes these AML cells, at least when they are in cycle, to atmospheric oxygen and to low

levels of many different DNA-damaging agents, including
chemotherapeutic agents used at doses that have minimal
or no effect on leukemic cells in the absence of cenersen.15
In this study, we focused on patients who were either
refractory to a single intensive front-line course of induction chemotherapy or who had relapsed <12 months after
frontline treatment. Historical data show that the
expected complete response (CR) rate for each of these
groups is 14% when treated with high-dose (1 g/m2)
cytarabine-containing regimens.18 The primary objective
was to determine the efficacy of cenersen in combination
with idarubicin and either no cyctarabine or 1 of 2 different doses (100 mg/m2 or 1 g/m2) of cytarabine.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cenersen
Cenersen is the United States Adopted Name and International Nonproprietary Name of a 20-mer phosphorothioate oligonucleotide that is complementary to a
portion of the coding sequence in p53 messenger RNA.
The specific nucleotide sequence is 50 -d[P-Thio](CCCTG CTCCC CCCTG GCTCC)- 30 .
Study Design
This was an open-label, phase 2a, randomized 3-arm study
involving treatments of increasing chemotherapy intensity
in combination with cenersen in first-salvage AML patients
18 years old. The trial was conducted using a selection
design that uses Bayesian principles to provide good frequentist properties to establish a probability of selecting the
truly active therapy regimens among those tested by rejecting any truly ineffective regimen. To be eligible, patients
were required to be refractory to 1 induction chemotherapy
course or to have obtained a CR lasting <12 months and to
have received no other salvage therapy. Other eligibility criteria included performance status of 0-2 and adequate organ
function. The study was approved by the institutional
review boards of the participating institutions, and all
patients signed informed consent.
The primary end point was CR rate. Historical data
(MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1991- 2001) indicate that

Cancer

January 15, 2012

the probability of CR for the subset of first-salvage patients
meeting the entry criteria for this study is 14%. The most
intensive (group 3) chemotherapy given in the current study
is equivalent to the cytarabine regimens given to nearly 70%
of the patients used to generate the historical control.
Treatment Plan
The treatment plan is summarized in Table 1. Patients
received therapy with cenersen via continuous intravenous
infusion (CIV) daily for 4 consecutive days. On the second day of cenersen administration, patients started a 3day course of idarubicin 12 mg/m2/day while continuing
therapy with cenersen. In addition, patients were randomized to receive no cytarabine, a daily dose of 100 mg/m2
cytarabine CIV for 7 consecutive days, or 1 g/m2 daily
CIV for 4 consecutive days (3 days for patients 60 years
of age). These schedules were selected to investigate the
optimal schedule of cytarabine to be used in combination
with cenersen and idarubicin in subsequent studies.
Patients not achieving remission after 1 course were
scheduled to receive a second course of induction chemotherapy with the same schedule as the first course. Patients
who achieved a response after 1 or 2 courses were eligible
to receive additional courses of the same regimen up to a
total of 6 at a frequency determined by the treating physician. Patients received supportive care, antimicrobials,
and other medications as required. Concomitant administration of acetaminophen and high-dose antioxidants was
prohibited by the protocol from 1 day before the start of
cenersen infusion through the end of day 6 of treatment
for a total of 7 days.
Patients underwent physical examination, complete
blood count, blood chemistry evaluation, bone marrow
aspiration, and cytogenetic analysis before the start of
therapy. During and after chemotherapy, patients were
followed with complete blood count and blood chemistry
at least once weekly, and a bone marrow aspiration was
scheduled on day 28 and then as clinically indicated to
assess response. Cytogenetic abnormalities were classified
according to the Medical Research Council criteria19 as
those conferring favorable prognosis, [t(8:21)(q22;q22)

and inv(16)], intermediate risk (diploid, þ21, þ22, þ4,
and þ8), and adverse risk (all others), and complex karyotype was defined as 3 abnormalities. Response to therapy was assessed using the definitions proposed by the
International Working Group.20
Statistical Analysis
After the initial sequential entry of 3 patients per dose
group (Table 1), the remaining patients were randomly
assigned to each of the 3 treatment groups. The outcome
of interest was CR. Historical data from the MD Anderson Cancer Center indicated that the probability of CR
among patients who failed a single induction course or
whose first CR lasted <12 months is 14% (52/372).
Denoting the probability of CR by yCR/H, we assumed
that yCR/H follows a (0.3, 1.7) beta distribution; this distribution has a mean of 0.15. We assumed that each of the
experimental treatment probabilities yCR/E1, yCR/E2, and
yCR/E3 follow the same distribution [ie, beta (0.3, 1.7)].
The early stopping rules were to terminate treatment
within each experimental arm if, compared with the historical experience, that arm’s CR rate is unlikely to
increase by a mean of 0.15. This rule was applied in each
experimental arm after each cohort of 5 patients, up to a
maximum of 15 per arm, was evaluated. The stopping
bounds generated by these rules were designed to terminate accrual to an arm if the CR rate was 0/5, 1/10, 2/
15, 3/20, 3/25, 4/30, 5/35, or 5/40. The sample sizes
above 15 (3/20 etc.) refer to the possibility that at least 1
arm would be terminated early, with accrual continuing
beyond 15 on the remaining arms.
All patients receiving at least 1 dose of cenersen constituted the intent-to-treat (ITT) population.
Ad Hoc Analyses and Definition of PerProtocol Subpopulation
Preclinical data suggested that use of acetaminophen or
antioxidants could adversely affect the potential benefit of
cenersen therapy. Although use of these agents was not
allowed by the protocol during treatment, 32% (17/53)
of the patients in the present study received acetaminophen (n ¼ 11), high-dose antioxidants (n ¼ 3), or both (n
¼ 3) during times specified by the protocol. In addition to
the 17 patients who received prohibited substances, 4
patients failed to meet the protocol entry criteria (2 patients
had multiple previous treatment failures; 1 patient had
myelofibrosis at study entry, screening bone marrow <5%
blasts, and disease that could not be monitored by bone
marrow analysis; and 1 patient received chemotherapy

420

(hydroxyurea) within 2 days from the start of study drug.
Hydroxyurea can cause p53 to undergo posttranslational
modifications that dramatically increase its half-life.
Accordingly, a per-protocol population was defined for
subset analysis that excluded the patients just described.
An ad hoc analysis was undertaken to determine the
effect, if any, of the use of acetaminophen and/or highdose antioxidants on the ability of a cenersen containing
regimen (cenersen regimen) to induce a response (CR or
complete response with incomplete platelet recovery
[CRp]). To achieve this, 11 of the 53 treated patients who
were inappropriate for this particular analysis were censored (4 did not meet entry criteria and 7 could not be analyzed for response [5 due to early death and 2 due to
uninterpretable bone marrow results]). Of the remaining
42 patients, 14 received substances prohibited by the protocol (8 acetaminophen, 3 high-dose antioxidants, and 3
both) during specified times and 28 did not. Thus, 3 of
the 17 patients who received prohibited substances could
not be evaluated for response and were, therefore, not
used in this analysis.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
The patient characteristics for the overall ITT population
for each of the treatment groups are shown in Table 2.
The ITT and per protocol populations had an identical
median age of 58 years (range, 19-88 years). There were
no significant differences among the treatment groups 1,
2, or 3 with respect to sex, age, race, or cytogenetics. Nineteen of the ITT patients (36%) were previously unresponsive to a single front-line induction course, and 34 (64%)
had relapsed from front-line therapy in <12 months.
Cytogenetic analysis was available for 49 patients, and of
these 57% had intermediate, 35% had adverse, and 8%
had favorable risk cytogenetic abnormalities.
Response to Treatment
Considering the ITT population, there were 13 patients
in arm 1, 21 in arm 2, and 19 in arm 3. None of the 3
treatment groups triggered the prospectively defined stopping rules that were established to eliminate treatments
that did not at least match the historical control of a 14%
CR rate. The ITT response rates by treatment group are
shown in Table 3. There appeared to be a trend toward
better results with increasing intensity of chemotherapy
culminating in a 21% (4/19) CR rate in group 3. Among
all 3 treatment groups, 10 patients responded to therapy

The previous therapy received by patients with response
to cenersen-based therapy is presented in Table 4.
Table 5 shows the response rates by treatment group
for the per-protocol population. The response rates of
each corresponding group appear to be better than those
seen in the ITT analysis (Table 3). The number of responders either within or between groups, however, is too
small to meaningfully test differences by cytarabine intensity. The best outcome was seen in group 3, in which the
per-protocol CR rate was 36%, whereas there was 1 CR
(13%) and 1 CRp in the 8 evaluable patients in group 1
(25%) and 3 CR (23%) and 1 CRp in the 13 evaluable
patients in group 2 (31%).
The results of the ad hoc analysis to determine what
effect the use of acetaminophen and/or high-dose antioxidants had, if any, on response to a cenersen regimen is
shown in Table 6. All 10 responders in this study were
found to be in the group of 28 evaluable patients who did
not receive these substances during treatment, whereas
none of the 14 patients who received these substances during treatment responded (P ¼ 0.0174; 95% confidence
interval, 7.5%-62.6%).

The ratio of patients in this study who were nonresponsive to a single induction course versus those relapsing
<12 months after induction treatment was in the
expected range. A disproportionate number of the group
refractory to front-line treatment (60%) responded to
therapy with cenersen (Table 7). This trend is seen in
both the ITT (CR, 26% vs 9%; CR þ CRp, 32% vs
12%) and the per-protocol populations (CR, 38% vs.
16%; CR þ CRp, 46% vs 21%). Two of the responses to
cenersen-based therapy among the patients unresponsive
to front-line induction therapy occurred in group 1, 1
occurred in group 2, and 3 occurred in group 3 (Table 4).
Duration of Remissions and Survival
After a median follow-up of 18.5 months from start of
therapy, 2 patients remain alive and in CR. The median
duration of response for all 10 responding patients was
7.9 months (range, 2-24). Patients received a median of 1
course of therapy, with 12 patients receiving 2 or more
courses of therapy (7 of these were responders). After
achieving remission, 7 patients underwent stem cell transplantation. The median duration of the response to a cenersen regimen for nontransplant patients (n ¼ 3) was 11.2

versus 6.6 months for those who received a transplant
(n ¼ 7).
The median survival for the total patient population was 5.3 months (range, 0.3-26.8) and 6.3 months
(range, 0.3-26.8) for the per-protocol population (Figure 1). Survival estimates for the 3 treatment groups are
shown in Figure 2. Seven patients (13%) died during
induction (ie, during the 30 days immediately after the
start of chemotherapy), with the cause of death reported
as respiratory failure (n ¼ 3), cardiopulmonary arrest
(n ¼ 2), sepsis (n ¼ 1), and intracranial hemorrhage
(n ¼ 1).

Six of the 10 responding patients had been refractory
to their front-line treatment. Of these, the average duration
of response after a cenersen regimen was 7.6 months (range,
2.3-24.5 months). The average response duration for the
patients responding to their original front-line treatment
was 9.7 months (range, 5.9-12.2 months) compared with
8.4 months (range, 5.4-11.6 months) after salvage treatment
with cenersen. The 2 relapsed patients who had a shorter
response duration after a cenersen regimen (220 and 163
days) compared with that following front-line treatment
(366 and 343 days) died shortly following transplantation.

death included respiratory failure/arrest (n ¼ 3); cardiopulmonary arrest (n ¼ 3); progressive disease (n ¼ 2); and
septic shock, multiorgan failure, sepsis, intracranial hemorrhage, and unknown cause (n ¼ 1 each).
Because idarubicin was included in all arms of therapy in this study, the frequency of adverse events seen in

424

this study was compared with the frequency of adverse
events described in the Idamycin package insert. Several
differences were observed in the most common toxicities
between those observed in this study and those reported
in the package insert for idarubicin used in combination
with the cytarabine regimen used for group 2: mucositis
(34% vs 50%), hemorrhage (30% vs 63%), hair loss
(13% vs 77%), and nausea and vomiting (68% vs 82%).

DISCUSSION
In phase 1 testing, cenersen was used as a single agent over
5 dose levels to treat 16 patients with AML or advanced
myelodysplasia.21 Cenersen demonstrated similar pharmacokinetics to other phosphorothioates, and no specific
toxicities were attributed to its administration. There were
no clinical responses. It was expected at the time that cenersen would have activity as a single agent based on in
vitro studies. It was subsequently found, however, that
atmospheric oxygen was supplying sufficient genomic
damage to allow for the antileukemic effect of cenersen in
vitro. Furthermore, it was shown that low-dose anthracyclines could replace the elevated oxygen level as a source of
genomic damage.15
The current phase 2a study was undertaken to clinically test the demonstrated need to combine a p53 inhibitor with a genome damaging agent to enhance the killing
of cancer cells with wild-type p53.13,14,22-25 The statistical
design of the study provided for the elimination of any of
the 3 treatment arms that did not meet a predetermined
response rate. A total of 53 patients were treated in this

was less than that used to generate the historical control
data. The CR rate in the ITT population was 15%, with a
trend toward an improving CR rate with increasing dose
of cytarabine (8%, 14%, and 21%). Thus, the primary
end point for the ITT population was not different than
the 14% historical control. However, we have insufficient
information to determine whether there is a true difference in response by cytarabine dose, particularly when
considering only patients treated per protocol.
Given the frequent use of prohibited substances in
this study, an ad hoc per-protocol population was defined
for the purpose of a subset analysis. This per-protocol
population primarily excluded patients who received the
substances prohibited by the protocol for use during treatment but also excluded patients who could not be evaluated for response or who did not meet the entry criteria.
The protocol precluded the use of acetaminophen
and high-dose antioxidants during treatment, because
these agents had been shown in vitro to block the antileukemia effect of cenersen. Human AML cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells express cytochrome
P450 that converts acetaminophen to the highly reactive
metabolite n-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI).27,28
NAPQI also has been shown to covalently bind to endogenous DNA in vivo but at low frequency.29 NAPQI alkylates cenersen and other phosphorothioates at multiple
sites but not oligonucleotides with a phosphodiester linkage.30 Thus, this alkylation mostly likely occurs on the
nonbridging sulfur in the phosphorothioate linkage.
Antioxidants scavenge free radicals that exhibit antileukemia effects on freshly obtained AML blasts when
combined with cenersen. In addition, a wide variety of
antioxidants can induce p21 independently of p53 and
thereby cause cell cycle arrest.31-35 A key component of
cenersen’s potential to sensitize cancers with wild-type
p53 to conventional cancer therapeutics is its ability to
prevent p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and repair activated by DNA-damaging agents.32-35 Failure to arrest
proliferation allows the cancer cells to replicate their damaged DNA and, in turn, activate p53-independent programmed cell death. High-dose antioxidants could stop
this process by causing cell cycle arrest and inhibiting the
therapeutic effect of cenersen.
Three lines of evidence based on comparisons
between subgroups of the treated patients suggest possible
positive trends, supportive of the notion that cenersen
might be active in AML. First, the analysis showed that

Cancer

the use of prohibited cenersen inhibitors during treatment
was associated with no responses in the 14 patients who
received 1 or both of these substances and who could be
evaluated for response. In contrast, all 10 of the responders were in the group of 28 per-protocol patients who
could be evaluated for response and who did not receive
these prohibited substances. Thus, there was a positive
trend for a correlation between treatment failure and the
administration of cenersen inhibitors (P ¼ .0174).
Second, the response rate in the ITT group was
highest among patients refractory to a single course of
induction chemotherapy (CR, 26%; CR þ CRp, 32%)
compared with the response rate (CR, 9%; CR þ CRp,
12%) for relapsed patients. In the per-protocol group, the
respective CR rates for these 2 groups were refractory CR
38% (46% CR þ CRp) versus relapsed CR 16% (21%
CR þ CRp). Based on historical controls, these 2 groups
were expected to have the same CR rate for a subsequent
course of treatment.18,36 It is possible, however, that the
remissions achieved could have been achieved with the
same chemotherapy without cenersen. Randomized studies would be required to further evaluate the possible contribution of cenersen to the responses observed in this
patient population.
Third, 8 of the 10 patients achieving a CR or CRp
in this study either had been unresponsive to front-line
treatment or had responses that lasted longer than the
responses they had to previous front-line treatment, suggesting that the addition of cenersen to chemotherapy
may contribute to achieving or obtaining an increased duration of response. There were responders in all 3 treatment groups. The 7 responders who underwent
transplantation had a shorter median duration of response
than the 3 responders who did not. This suggests
the improvement in response duration following administration of a cenersen regimen was not due to transplantation. The 2 patients who had a shorter response duration
compared with that following front-line treatment
died after transplantation. Thus, the brevity of their
response duration may not be attributable to the cenersen
regimen.
Numerous studies have established that blocking
p53 function by various means protects a wide variety of
normal cells from the toxic effects of chemotherapy or
radiation.37-40 In this study, there was no evidence that
the addition of cenersen increased the toxicity expected
from chemotherapy alone, and no unique toxicity could
be attributed to cenersen. Subsequent controlled trials
involving cenersen should seek to more precisely define

425

Original Article

any role cenersen may have in protecting patients from
adverse events resulting from cytotoxic therapies.
The adverse event profiles in this study were both
qualitatively and quantitatively within the expected ranges
for these chemotherapeutic regimens in first-salvage
patients.26 This small study failed to signal attribution of
specific or unique toxicities to cenersen.
In conclusion, the combination of cenersen with
idarubicin, with or without cytarabine, is well tolerated.
The preclinical data and the results presented here suggest
that this combination could potentially have a role in the
management of AML. To achieve the optimal potential
benefit of cenersen in this context, avoidance of antioxidants and acetaminophen are required. A placebo-controlled randomized trial is required to determine the
clinical contribution of cenersen in this setting.
