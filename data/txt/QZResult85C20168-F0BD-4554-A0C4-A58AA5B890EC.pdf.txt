SUMMARY
Rho GTPases impact a number of activities important for oncogenesis. Here we describe a small
molecule inhibitor which blocks oncogenic transformation induced by various Rho GTPases in
fibroblasts, and the growth of human breast cancer and B lymphoma cells, without affecting
normal cells. We identify the target of this inhibitor to be the metabolic enzyme glutaminase,
which catalyzes the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate. We show that transformed fibroblasts
and breast cancer cells exhibit elevated glutaminase activity that is dependent on Rho GTPases
and NFκB activity, and is blocked by the small molecule inhibitor. These findings highlight a
previously unappreciated connection between Rho GTPase activation and cellular metabolism,
and demonstrate that targeting glutaminase activity can inhibit oncogenic transformation.

INTRODUCTION

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Rho-family GTPases activate signaling pathways that influence a variety of cellular
activities ranging from actin cytoskeletal rearrangements to cell polarity and migration, cell
cycle progression, and membrane trafficking (Etienne-Manneville and Hall 2002). A
number of lines of evidence have also implicated Rho GTPases in cell growth and malignant
transformation (Vega and Ridley 2008). For example, their hyper-activation either through
mutations or the deregulation of their guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs; e.g.
members of the Dbl (for Diffuse B cell lymphoma) family) results in cellular transformation
(Erickson and Cerione, 2004). Cells expressing constitutively active Rho GTPases are able
to grow under conditions of serum deprivation and in the absence of a substratum, and have
been shown to induce tumor formation when introduced into immuno-compromised mice
(Lin et al., 1999; Fort, P., 1999). Rho GTPases have also been implicated in naturally
occurring neoplastic development, where their over-expression has been demonstrated in
advanced stage breast cancers, as well as in a variety of other cancers (Suwa et al. 1998;

Mira et al., 2000; Fritz et al., 2002; Kamai et al., 2004). In particular, two members of the
family, RhoA and RhoC, have been linked to the progression of malignancy, i.e. poorly
differentiated phenotypes, local invasiveness, and metastasis (Kleer et al., 2002; Clark et al.,
2000; Burbelo et al., 2004; Valastyan et al., 2009). Moreover, DLC1 (for Deleted in Liver
Cancer 1), whose expression is suppressed in liver cancer tissue and in a wide variety of
other cancers, is a Rho-GTPase-activating protein (Rho-GAP) and therefore it appears to
play a role as a tumor suppressor (Xue et al., 2008; Lahoz and Hall, 2008). Thus, the Rho
GTPases represent intriguing targets for anti-cancer therapies. Here we describe the
identification and characterization of a small molecule that blocks the Rho GTPasedependent transformation of fibroblasts, as well as the growth and invasive activity of
human cancer cells.

RESULTS
Identification of an inhibitor of Rho GTPase-dependent transformation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

While screening for small molecule inhibitors of the transforming capabilities of activated
Rho GTPases, we found that members of the benzo[a]phenanthridinone family blocked the
cellular transformation induced by the Rho family-GEF oncogenic Dbl, as read-out in focusforming assays and when assaying cell growth in 10% calf serum or in low (1%) serum
(Figures 1A, S1A, and 1B, respectively). The most effective molecule, designated 968, was
active at 1–10 μM (Figure 1A, right panel). The dimethyl-amine and the adjacent bromine
substitution on the phenyl ring of 968 (circled in Figure 1C) are essential for maximal
inhibition of Dbl-induced transformation, as compounds 335 or 384 showed little or no
effect (Figures 1A and S1B). 968 was a more potent inhibitor of Dbl-induced
transformation, compared to oncogenic H-Ras, when assaying focus formation in NIH 3T3
cells (Figures S1B and S1C) or growth in low serum (compare Figures 1B and S1D),
indicating that the transforming activities of Rho GTPases are particularly sensitive to this
small molecule. Treatment with 968 had no significant effects on the growth of normal NIH
3T3 cells (Figure 1D) nor did it alter their overall morphology (Figure 1E).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The guanine nucleotide exchange activities of a number of Rho GTPases are directly
stimulated by oncogenic Dbl, including Cdc42 and RhoC (Hart et al., 1994); moreover, Rac
appears to be activated in cells expressing oncogenic Dbl, most likely as an outcome of its
ablity to function in a GTPase cascade downstream of activated Cdc42 (Baird et al., 2005).
Mutated Rho GTPases that undergo constitutive GDP-GTP exchange mimic many of the
actions of oncogenic Dbl (Lin et al, 1999). Thus, we used cells transformed by different Rho
GTPases to determine whether the inhibitory effects of 968 were due to its ability to block
the signaling activity of a specific target of Dbl, such as RhoC. In fact, we found that 968
was capable of inhibiting the transforming activity of each of the Rho GTPase mutants
examined, blocking their ability to enable cells to form colonies in soft-agar (Figure 2A) and
to grow to high density (Figure 2B) or in low serum (Figure 2C), as well as inhibiting their
invasive activity (Figure 2D).
968 blocks the transforming activity of human breast cancer cells
Rho GTPases have been shown to be over-expressed and/or hyper-activated in human breast
cancer cells (Kleer et al., 2002; Burbelo et al., 2004; Valastyan et al., 2009). For example,
RhoA and RhoC are hyper-activated in the highly invasive MDA-MB231 and SKBR3 breast
cancer cell lines compared to normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) (Figure
3A). In addition, the growth of these cancer cells in low serum or in soft-agar is severely
compromised when RhoA and RhoC levels are knocked-down using siRNAs (Figures
3B-3E). Given the ability of 968 to inhibit the transformation of fibroblasts by oncogenic
Dbl and different constitutively active Rho GTPases, we were interested in examining its

potential effects on these human breast cancer cells whose transformed phenotypes are
dependent upon Rho GTPase activity. We found that 968 inhibited their ability to form
colonies in soft agar, as effectively as it blocked Dbl-induced colony formation in NIH 3T3
cells (Figure 4A). Similarly, 968 inhibited their growth in complete medium (Figure 4B), as
well as their ability to grow to high density (Figure 4C) and in low serum (Figure 4D), and
reduced their invasive activity (Figure 4E). As was the case for control (non-transformed)
fibroblasts, 968 had little if any effect on the growth or morphology of HMECs (Figures 4C,
4F, and 4G).
Identification of the target for 968

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The ability of 968 to inhibit the transforming activities of different constitutively active Rho
GTPases indicated that the target for this small molecule was not a specific binding partner
or an effector for an individual Rho protein. We set out to identify the target for 968 by
using its active moiety (circled in Figure 1C) labeled with biotin in affinity precipitation
experiments with streptavidin beads. This led to the detection of a silver-stained band on
SDS-gels, Mr ~66 kDa, that was isolated from Cdc42(F28L)-expressing NIH 3T3 cell
lysates with the biotin-labeled 968-derivative immobilized to streptavidin beads, but not
with beads alone (Figure S2A). Microsequence analysis indicated that this was the mouse
isoform-2 ortholog of human glutaminase C (GAC) (Figure S2B), one of two splice variants
of an enzyme found in kidney and other tissues, collectively referred to as kidney-type
glutaminase (KGA), that catalyzes the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate and ammonium
(Curthoys, 1995). We verified that the biotin-labeled active moiety of 968, when
immobilized on streptavidin beads, affinity-precipitated an endogenous protein that reacted
with an antibody recognizing both isoforms of KGA (Figure S2C), as well as precipitated
ectopically expressed, V5-tagged GAC (Figure 5A, top panel). Pre-incubation of E. coliexpressed, mouse GAC with 968 inhibited its enzyme activity (Figure 5A), whereas the
structurally-related compound 335, that was less effective at blocking Dbl-transformation
(Figure 1A), showed little inhibition. 968 was neither a competitive inhibitor versus
glutamine nor inorganic phosphate, an activator of the enzyme (Kenny et al., 2003),
suggesting that it acts in an allosteric manner (Figures S2D–2F).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next examined whether knocking-down the levels of KGA expression in transformed
cells using RNAi mimicked the effects of treating these cells with 968. Figures 5B and S3A
show that reducing KGA expression by using siRNAs targeting both of its isoforms
inhibited the abilities of Cdc42(F28L), Rac(F28L), and RhoC(F30L) to stimulate growth in
low serum. Similarly, knocking-down KGA expression blocked the ability of these different
constitutively activated Rho GTPases to induce colony formation in soft agar (Figures 5C
and S3B), whereas knock-downs of KGA did not significantly inhibit the growth of control
NIH 3T3 cells (Figure S3C), consistent with the inability of 968 to affect their growth
(Figure 1D). However, knocking-down KGA also strongly inhibited MDA-MB231 and
SKBR3 cells from growing in low serum (Figure 5D) and soft-agar (Figure 5E).
The importance of glutaminase activity for transformation is consistent with the dependence
of transformed/cancer cells on extracellular glutamine (Figures 6A and 6B). We reasoned
that if 968 blocks transformation by inhibiting glutaminase activity, it should also reduce the
levels of α-ketoglutarate, an intermediate in the glutamine metabolic pathway. Therefore, the
effects of 968 should be circumvented by adding a cell-permeable analog of α-ketoglutarate
(dimethyl α-ketoglutarate or DM-α-KG) to cells. Figure 6C shows that when the KGA
isoforms were knocked-down from Dbl-transformed cells, the addition of DM-α-KG
restored their ability to grow in low serum. Likewise, the addition of DM-α-KG restored the
ability of 968-treated Dbl-cells to grow in low serum (Figure 6D) and their focus-forming
activity (Figure 6E), as well as the ability of 968-treated MDA-MB231 and SKBR3 cells to
grow in low serum (Figures 6F and 6G).

The expression of the KGA isoform GAC is up-regulated in P-493 B lymphoma cells (Gao
et al., 2009), which prompted us to examine the effects of 968 on these cancer cells. Figures
7A and 7B show that 968 inhibited their growth, whereas the inactive analog 335 had
essentially no effect. Similarly, in mouse xenograft experiments where tumors were induced
by the introduction of P-493 B lymphoma cells, the intra-peritoneal injection of 968 caused
an ~50% reduction in the size of the tumors (Figure 7C). However, the over-expression of
GAC, alone, is not sufficient to induce malignant transformation (Gao et al., 2009).
Moreover, glutaminase expression in Dbl-transformed fibroblasts or in SKBR3 breast cancer
cells is similar to that of non-transformed cells (see below), suggesting that GAC works
together with other oncogenic proteins to satisfy the metabolic requirements for
transformation. This is supported by the results in Figure 7D, in which the transient
expression of GAC alone, in NIH 3T3 cells was insufficient to induce foci, whereas the
expression of GAC in cells stably expressing the Cdc42(F28L) mutant, which exhibits only
weak focus-forming activity, caused a dramatic increase in foci matching the strong
response induced by oncogenic Dbl. The increase in foci accompanying the expression of
GAC together with Cdc42(F28L) was blocked by 968 (Figure 7D) and did not occur when
the catalytically dead GAC(S291A) mutant was co-expressed with Cdc42(F28L) (Figure
7E).
Glutaminase activity is elevated in transformed/cancer cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Given that glutaminase is not over-expressed in transformed fibroblasts or SKBR3 cells, we
examined whether it is activated in these cells. Indeed, mitochondrial preparations from Dbltransformed fibroblasts exhibited much higher basal glutaminase activity (i.e. assayed in the
absence of inorganic phosphate) compared to the activity in mitochondria from nontransformed NIH 3T3 cells (Figure 8A; p = 0.001). Mitochondria from Cdc42(F28L)expressing cells showed lower basal levels of activity compared to Dbl-transformed cells (p
value = 0.019), but still higher than non-transformed cells (p = 0.023). Rac(F28L)- and
RhoC(F30L)-transformed cells also showed higher basal levels of mitochondrial
glutaminase activity compared to control cells (p = 0.019 and 0.009, respectively). The
enzyme activity in mitochondrial preparations from control cells was strongly stimulated by
the addition of inorganic phosphate (~6-fold), approaching the phosphate-stimulated activity
measured in the mitochondria from transformed cells (Figure S4A), consistent with these
two sets of cells showing similar levels of enzyme expression. Treatment of the different
transformed cells with 968 inhibited their mitochondrial glutaminase activity, with the basal
enzyme activity being much more sensitive to the small molecule inhibitor than the
phosphate-stimulated activity (Figures 8A and S4A).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Mitochondrial preparations from SKBR3 cells, as well as MDA-MB231 cells, also showed
significantly higher basal glutaminase activity, compared to normal HMECs (p = 0.003),
that was strongly inhibited when the cells were treated with 968 (Figure 8B; the top panels
show that equivalent amounts of mitochondrial protein were assayed, by using the
mitochondrial marker VDAC/Porin). The addition of inorganic phosphate to the
mitochondrial preparations from HMECs caused a marked increase in glutaminase activity
(~5-fold), and although the levels of activity were still lower than in MDA-MB231 cells
which show significantly higher KGA expression (Figure 8B, top panel), they were similar
to the phosphate-stimulated activity in the mitochondria from SKBR3 cells (Figure S4B).
Knock-downs of RhoA and RhoC in SKBR3 cells reduced their basal glutaminase activity,
without significantly affecting phosphate stimulation of the enzyme, indicating that the
increased basal activity was Rho GTPase-dependent (Figure S4C).
An important insight into how glutaminase is activated in transformed fibroblasts and
SKBR3 cells came from our finding that treatment of these cells with BAY 11-7082, which
blocks NFκB activation by inhibiting the upstream kinase IKKβ (Pickering et al., 2007),

significantly reduced their basal glutaminase activity (Figures 8C and 8D, respectively).
Knocking-down the p65/RelA subunit of NFκB in Dbl-transformed cells and SKBR3 cells
also reduced their basal glutaminase activity (Figures 8C and 8D), whereas treatment with
BAY11-7082 or knock-downs of p65/RelA had little or no effect on the direct stimulation of
the enzyme by inorganic phosphate (Figures S4D and S4E). This indicates that the effects of
blocking NFκB are specific for those signals in transformed/cancer cells that elevate the
basal levels of enzyme activity.
We then showed that the immunoprecipitation of ectopically expressed, V5-tagged GAC
from Dbl-transformed cells yielded significantly higher basal activity compared to V5-GAC
immunoprecipitated from non-transformed NIH 3T3 cells (Figure 8E). The activity
immunoprecipitated from Dbl-transformed cells was reduced when the cells were treated
with 968, as well as with an NFκB inhibitor, suggesting that V5-GAC was activated in
transformed cells through an NFκB-dependent mechanism. The enhanced basal activity for
V5-GAC immunoprecipitated from Dbl-cells was reversed by alkaline phosphatase
treatment, whereas the stimulation by inorganic phosphate was essentially unaffected
(Figure 8F). These findings suggest that NFκB does not elevate basal glutaminase activity in
transformed/cancer cells by directly affecting the expression of the enzyme itself, but rather
by influencing the expression of a protein kinase or a regulatory protein(s) that promotes its
phosphorylation.

DISCUSSION
The importance of bioenergetics and cellular metabolism in the development of cancer, and
in particular, the early observations that tumor cells exhibit elevated glycolytic activity (i.e.
the “Warburg effect” (Warburg 1956)), are receiving renewed attention (DeBerardinis et al.,
2007; Christofk et al., 2008a, 2008b). Recently, it was found that phospho-tyrosine signaling
impacts the glycolytic pathway by shifting the utilization of glucose metabolites from
energy production to anabolic processes through the regulation of the M2 (fetal) isoform of
pyruvate kinase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to
pyruvate (Christofk et al., 2008a, 2008b; Hitosugi et al., 2009). It was also recently reported
that the c-Myc-induced up-regulation of GAC expression in B lymphoma and prostate
cancer cells is essential for their proliferation and survival (Gao et al., 2009). Here we
demonstrate that transformed/cancer cells dependent on Rho GTPase-signaling activity
exhibit elevated levels of basal glutaminase activity and that blocking the activation of this
enzyme can have profound consequences for oncogenic transformation.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The discovery that glutaminase activity is required for the transforming capability of at least
three different Rho GTPases (Cdc42, Rac1, RhoC) suggests that these GTPases are linked to
the activation of this enzyme through a common signaling point of convergence. Our finding
that NFκB is essential for glutaminase activation in transformed/cancer cells helps to explain
how different Rho GTPases are able to signal an increase in basal glutaminase activity and
why their transforming activities are sensitive to 968, as NFκB is activated by Dbl and
various Rho GTPases (Perona et al., 1997; Cammarano and Minden, 2001), and is essential
for Dbl-transformation (Whitehead et al., 1999) as well as for the transformed phenotypes of
human breast cancer cells (Sovak et al., 1997). The mechanism by which NFκB mediates the
activation of this metabolic enzyme, and in particular its phosphorylation, is an important
focus of our current studies. The fact that cells treated with 968 do not exhibit elevated basal
levels of glutaminase activity suggests that this small molecule acts in an allosteric manner
to block the activation event, thus explaining how its inhibitory effects are sustained through
the isolation of mitochondrial fractions from transformed/cancer cells. The ability of 968 to
act in an allosteric manner is also consistent with our kinetic studies that demonstrate that
968 is neither a glutamine antagonist nor an active site competitive inhibitor, and likely

explains why its effects appear to be much more pronounced on transformed/cancer cells
compared to normal cells.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Recently, it has been shown that the expression of a distinct form of glutaminase, referred to
as the liver-type enzyme or GLS2, was substantially decreased in liver cancer cells and that
its over-expression reduced colony formation (Hu et al., 2010; Suzuki et al., 2010). The
liver-type enzyme has different kinetic and molecular characteristics, and is likely to be
subject to distinct modes of regulation and cellular actions compared to the kidney-type
enzymes (i.e. collectively referred to as KGA or also GLS1), whose GAC isoform was
originally identified as the target of 968. Moreover, it is possible that the liver-type enzyme
is exerting its effects in liver cancer cells through its potential ability to influence
transcription (Szeglia et al., 2009), a function that has not been ascribed to the KGA
isoforms.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

How the regulation of glycolysis in the cytoplasm and oxidative metabolism through the
citric acid cycle in the mitochondnria is balanced so that tumor cells are able to satisfy their
energy requirements and metabolic needs is not entirely understood. 13C-NMR metabolic
flux experiments have demonstrated that while proliferating cancer cells exhibit a
pronounced Warburg effect, their TCA cycle remains intact and becomes progressively
more dependent on glutamine metabolism (DeBerardinis et al., 2007). This may enable
cancer cells to use TCA cycle intermediates as precursors for biosynthetic pathways
(DeBerardinis et al., 2008), and is consistent with tumor cells exhibiting increased rates of
glutamine metabolism and consuming greater amounts of glutamine compared to normal
cells (Medina et al., 1992). The observation that different transformed cell lines and cancer
cells show elevated glutaminase activity that is dependent on Rho GTPase/NFκB-activation
provides a mechanism for how these demands for elevated glutamine metabolism are met.
Moreover, the ability of the small molecule 968 to block glutaminase activation and inhibit
the growth of transformed/cancer cells highlights the potential of this enzyme as a drugable
target and offers intriguing possibilities regarding the use of small molecule allosteric
inhibitors of glutaminase as therapeutic strategies against cancer.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cell culture and treatment with 968

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing Cdc42(F28L), RhoC(F30L), Rac(F28L), Ras(G12V), and
oncogenic Dbl were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum (Invitrogen).
Two types of human breast cancer cells, MDA-MB231 and SKBR3 cells, were cultured in
RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Normal mammary epithelial cells
(HMECs) were cultured in MEGM complete medium (Lonza). The small molecule 968 (10
μM) was added to the culture medium 5 hours after the cells were seeded. The cells were
then treated with 968 during various assays for cellular transformation.
Assays for cellular transformation and invasion
The detailed procedures for cellular transformation assays including growth in low serum,
saturation density, and colony formation in soft agar were performed as previously described
(Wang et al., 2005; Feng et al., 2006). When assaying cell growth in low serum, or
saturation density, the medium containing 968 was changed every two days. These changes
were performed every three days when assaying cell growth in soft agar.
Focus formation assays were performed with NIH 3T3 cells that were grown in 60 mm
plates and transienly transfected with 1 μg pZip-neo-GST-Dbl (in which the original
construct of oncogenic Dbl, residues 498–925, was obtained from Dr. A. Eva; Genoa, Italy)
or 2 μg pCDNA 3.1-V5-glutaminase (i.e. the mouse ortholog of the human GAC isoform).

In some cases, these transient transfections were performed using NIH 3T3 cells that stably
express Cdc42(F28L). Following transfection, the cells were trypsinized, aliquoted equally
into two 60 mm plates, and allowed to adhere overnight. On the following day, the media
was changed to DMEM plus 5% calf serum, or DMEM plus 5% calf serum and 968. A 60
mm plate of NIH 3T3 cells, or cells stably expressing Cdc42(F28L), was left untreated as a
negative control. All cells were then grown for 14 days, with media and compounds changed
every second day. Plates were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and stained with 0.4% crystal
violet.
For cell invasion assays, growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Bioscience) was diluted (30
μg in 100 μl sterile H2O), added to the top chamber (Milli Cell) and allowed to gel for 1
hour at 37°C, and then air-dried for 16 hours. Serum-starved cells were added to the upper
compartment in migration medium (DMEM with 0.5% BSA) and the chamber was placed
into 24-well dishes containing DMEM with 10% CS. After 24 hours incubation at 37°C,
migratory cells were fixed with methanol, stained with Giemsa and counted under the
microscope.
Animal studies

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The experiments with mouse xenografts were performed according to the protocols
approved by the Animal Care and Use Committees at Cornell University and The Johns
Hopkins University. In these experiments, 2 × 107 P493 human lymphoma B cells were
injected s.c. into male SCID mice (National Cancer Institute). When the tumor volumes
reached ~170 mm3, intraperitoneal injections with 968 or vehicle control were initiated and
performed daily for 12 days. Tumor volumes were calculated for the individual days of
treatment as described by Le et al. (2010).
Identification of glutaminase as the target of 968

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

968 (5-[3-bromo-4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]-2,2-dimethyl-2,3,5,6-tetrahydrobenzo[a]) and
its analogs were obtained from SPECS (Netherlands; CAS). In order to identify the
molecular target of 968, its active moiety (3-bromo-4-(dimethylamino)benzaldehyde)
(ChemBridge Corporation, San Diego) was incorporated into biotin hydrazide by reacting 3bromo-4-(dimethylamino)benzaldehyde or formaldehyde (as a negative control) at a 5-fold
molar excess overnight at 42°C, followed by reduction with cyanoborohydride coupling
buffer. The 968-biotin adduct was confirmed by mass spectrometry and incubated with
streptavidin-agarose beads equilibrated with cell lysis buffer (5 mM MgCl2, 120 mM NaCl,
10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5% NP-40, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) prior to
incubation with lysates from NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing Cdc42(F28L) (5 ml containing
~2 mg/ml total protein) for 2 h at 4°C. The beads were washed 3X with cold lysis buffer and
pelleted by centrifugation and the associated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. A
silver-stained protein band that bound specifically to the 968-biotin beads and not to the
control beads was excised and analyzed by mass spectrometry at the Harvard
Microchemistry Facility (Cambridge, Massachusetts) and identified as mouse KGA
isoform-2 (accession number NP_001106854), the mouse ortholog of the human GAC
isoform.
Mitochondrial preparations
Mitochondrial preparations were obtained using the mitochondria isolation kit from
QIAGEN following the manufacturer’s instructions. A suspension containing 2 × 107 cells
was transferred into a 50 ml conical tube and centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
The pellets were resuspended in 2 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (supplied by QIAGEN) and
incubated for 10 minutes at 4°C using an end-over-end shaker. The lysates were centrifuged
at 1000 × g for 10 minutes at 4°C, and the pellets were resuspended in a buffer supplied by

the manufacturer and disrupted by using a blunt-ended, 23-gauge needle and a syringe,
followed by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 20 minutes at 4°C. The pellets were resuspended
in 100 μl of 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 20 mM β-glycerolphosphate,
1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 20 mM sodium fluoride, and assayed for activity as
previously described (Kenny et al., 2003) and outlined below for assaying recombinant
enzyme, except that the recombinant protein was replaced by 20 μl of resuspended
mitochondrial lysate.
RNAi
The knock-down of KGA was performed using two distinct Stealth Select RNAi Duplexes
from Invitrogen directed against the two forms of the kidney-type enzyme. The RNAi
nucleotides were transiently transfected in either control NIH 3T3 cells and NIH 3T3 cells
stably expressing Cdc42(F28L), Rac(F28L), RhoC(F30L), MDA-MB231 cells, or SKBR3
cells using Lipofectamine 2000 and the relative knock-down efficiency was determined
using a polyclonal antibody that recognizes both forms of KGA (a kind gift from Dr. N.
Curthoys, Colorado State University). A non-specific oligonucleotide was used as a negative
control. Knock-downs of RhoA, RhoC, and p65/RelA were performed with siRNAs
obtained from Invitrogen and their efficiencies were determined using anti-RhoC polyclonal
antibody from Santa Cruz, and an anti-RhoA monoclonal antibody and an anti-p65/RelA
polyclonal antibody from Cell Signaling.

Assays of recombinant glutaminase activity

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Glutaminase activity assays were performed on recombinant enzyme as previously
described (Kenny et al., 2003). A plasmid encoding mouse GAC (residues 128–603) was
cloned into the pET28a vector and the protein was expressed with an N-terminal histidine
(His)-tag. The tag was cleaved using thrombin and the protein was purified by anionexchange and gel-filtration chromatography. Recombinant GAC (1 μM) was incubated with
varying concentrations of 968 in 57 mM Tris-Acetate (pH 8.6) and 0.225 mM EDTA by
rotating at 37°C for 30 minutes, in a final volume of 80 μl. 968 was diluted in DMSO such
that the volume added was constant (5 μl) for all samples, ensuring that the concentration of
DMSO (6.3% v/v) was the same in each of the assay incubations. A glutamine solution was
then added to give a final volume of 115 μl and a final concentration of 17 mM. The
reaction proceeded at 37°C for 1 h and was stopped by adding 10 μl of ice-cold 3M HCl. An
aliquot of the quenched reaction mixture (10 μl) was added to an incubation containing 114
mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.4), 0.35 mM ADP, 1.7 mM NAD and 6.3 U/ml glutamate
dehydrogenase to give a final volume of 228 μl. The reaction mixture was incubated at room
temperature for 45 minutes and the absorbance at 340 nm was recorded for each sample
against a water blank. The absorbance of the sample with just the cocktail mixture was
subtracted from each reading to calculate the activity of the enzyme.

average of 3 experiments (± s.d.).
(B) Mitochondrial fractions were prepared from equivalent numbers of the indicated breast
cancer cells that had been treated with 10 μM 968 or untreated. Top: Relative amounts of
KGA and VDAC in the mitochondrial preparations. Bottom: The different mitochondrial
fractions were assayed for basal glutaminase activity. 100% = 750 nM glutamine hydrolyzed
per minute per 105 cells. Data represent the average of 3 experiments (± s.d.).
(C) Mitochondrial fractions from NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing Dbl that were cultured for
2 days in the presence or absence of 2 μM BAY 11-7082, or transfected with control siRNA
or siRNAs targeting p65/RelA. Top: Relative amounts of KGA in the mitochondria from the
indicated cells as assessed using an antibody that recognizes both KGA isoforms, and
relative efficiencies of two siRNAs targeting p65/RelA. Bottom: The basal glutaminase
activity for the different mitochondrial fractions. 100% represents the activity for untreated
Dbl-transformed cells. Data represent the average of 2 experiments (± range).
(D) Mitochondrial fractions were prepared from HMECs, and SKBR3 cells that had been
treated with 2 μM BAY 11-7082 or untreated, or transfected with siRNAs targeting p65/
RelA. Top: Relative amounts of KGA in the different mitochondrial fractions as assessed
using an antibody that reorganizes both KGA isoforms, and relative efficiencies of two
siRNAs targeting p65/RelA. Bottom: The basal glutaminase activity for the different
mitochondrial fractions. 100% represents the activity for untreated SKBR3 cells. Data
represent the average of 2 experiments (± range).
(E) Top: V5-GAC was transiently expressed in control NIH 3T3 cells or NIH 3T3 cells
stably expressing Dbl that were treated with either 2 μM BAY 11-7082, 10 μM 968, or
untreated, and then immunoprecipitated from the different samples. Bottom: Basal activity
for V5-GAC immunoprecipitated from the different cells. Data represent the average of 3
experiments (± s.d.).
(F) V5-GAC was transiently expressed in NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing Dbl. The V5GAC was immunoprecipitated, treated with alkaline phosphatase for 1 hour at 37°C (or
untreated), and assayed for activity in the presence and absence of phosphate.
