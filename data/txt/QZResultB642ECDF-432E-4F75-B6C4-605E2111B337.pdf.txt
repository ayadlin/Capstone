BACKGROUND: Although platinum-based combinations are considered the best option of care for patients
with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), single-agent therapy is the preferred treatment for older
patients. Since the late 1990s, various combinations of third-generation agents (gemcitabine [G], vinorelbine, docetaxel, and paclitaxel) have been tested, yielding contradictory results. The authors of this report
performed a literature-based meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and tolerability of G-based doublets
compared with single-agent chemotherapy for elderly patients with NSCLC. METHODS: Data from all published, randomized, phase 3 trials that compared a G-based doublet with a third-generation single agent in
elderly patients were collected from electronic databases (Medline and the Cochrane Central Register of
Controlled Trials), relevant reference lists, and abstract books. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were calculated
for the 1-year survival rate, the overall response rate (ORR), and grade 3 and 4 toxicities. RESULTS: Four eligible trials (1436 patients) were selected from 442 studies that initially were identified. A significant difference in ORR favoring G-based doublets over single agents was observed (OR, 0.65; 95% confidence
interval [95% CI], 0.51-0.82 [P < .001]), whereas the trend toward an improved 1-year survival rate was not
significant (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.57-1.06 [P ¼.169]). Grade 3 and 4 toxicities did not differ significantly except
for thrombocytopenia (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.12-2.76 [P ¼.014]). CONCLUSIONS: G-based doublets appeared
to be effective and feasible compared with single agents in the treatment of elderly patients with advanced
NSCLC who were not suitable for full-dose, platinum-based chemotherapy. Further prospective, elderly

Gemcitabine Doublets for Elderly NSCLC/Russo et al

The standard treatment for elderly patients with
advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains a
matter of debate. Although the median age at diagnosis is
70 years,1 elderly patients with cancer are under-represented in clinical trials, mainly because of protocol exclusion criteria.2,3
The physiologic decline associated with aging may
affect chemotherapy-induced toxicities. However,
chronologic age alone cannot address individual patient
management.4 Several reports have remarked that a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) may help identify
those older individuals who are fit and are more likely to
benefit from standard cancer treatment compared with
those who are vulnerable and need tailored chemotherapy
regimens or those who are frail and are candidates for supportive care only.5 Consequently, the inclusion of CGA
in studies designed for elderly patients is strongly
recommended.6
Because of the selection of a favorable subset of elderly patients who can tolerate cancer treatment better,
older patients enrolled in clinical trials are less likely to be
representative of the whole elderly population, so that
considerable caution is needed when collecting data from
retrospective analyses of phase 3 randomized trials.7
Although the response rate and the survival rate (SR)
among elderly patients with NSCLC who receive platinum-based therapy are similar to those among younger
patients,8-10 such treatment should be considered only for
fit patients until ongoing elderly specific trial results are
presented.11
Available data regarding the efficacy and tolerability
of current chemotherapy regimens in the treatment of elderly patients with advanced NSCLC indicate that no
specific regimen can be regarded as the standard therapy
except third-generation single agents.12,13 In the phase 3
Elderly Lung Cancer Vinorelbine Italian Study, vinorelbine compared with best supportive care alone demonstrated a significant advantage in terms of the median
overall survival and better quality-of-life scores.14 Gemcitabine and taxanes also were studied extensively as singleagent chemotherapy regimens and demonstrated both
activity and tolerability in prospective phase 2 and 3 trials.15-17 Specifically, a 3-week schedule of docetaxel compared with vinorelbine improved progression-free survival
(PFS), the overall response rate (ORR), and cancer-related
symptoms but was associated with higher rates of grade 3

and 4 neutropenia.18 To improve on the results obtained
with single third-generation agents, nonplatinum thirdgeneration doublets, such as gemcitabine-vinorelbine or
gemcitabine-taxanes, were evaluated and yielded contradictory results with regard to response and SRs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Objective of the Current Study
The current literature-based meta-analysis was performed
to evaluate the efficacy (1-year SR and ORR) and the toxicity profile of third-generation doublets compared with
third-generation single agents for the first-line treatment
of elderly patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLCs.

Criteria for Selecting Studies
Only published, randomized phase 3 trials that evaluated
the benefit of adding a second third-generation drug to a
third-generation single agent in untreated elderly patients
with advanced NSCLC were selected. Because the definition of elderly based on calendar age remains unclear, and
no cutoff age has been established to date, the age of
patients enrolled in elderly specific trials may vary. We
performed an electronic search using the medical subject
headings (MeSH) term ‘‘aged, elderly,’’ which indicates
individuals ages 65 through 79 years.

Search Strategy
A thorough bibliographic electronic search of MEDLINE
(from 1966 to September 2008) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted. The following search terms were used: ‘‘randomized,’’ ‘‘phase III,’’
‘‘NSCLC,’’ ‘‘carcinoma, non-small-cell lung/drug therapy’’
(MeSH), ‘‘carcinoma, non-small-cell lung/secondary’’
(MeSH), ‘‘elderly,’’ ‘‘aged’’ (MeSH), and ‘‘antineoplastic
combined chemotherapy protocols’’ (MeSH). The search was
limited to trials that were randomized, controlled, and
published in the English language (English [lang] AND
randomized controlled trial [ptyp]). The results were supplemented with manual searches of American Society of
Clinical Oncology meeting proceedings, references of
selected articles, and published reviews. When an abstract
from a meeting and a full article referred to the same trial,
1925

Original Article

only the full article was evaluated. When 2 or more articles
reported the same data, the most recently updated data
were included.
Definition of Outcomes
Efficacy was assessed using 1-year SR as the primary outcome and ORR as the secondary outcome. The 1-year SR
is defined as the percentage of patients who remain alive
1 year after randomization, and the ORR is the percentage
of patients who have a complete or partial tumor response
according to World Health Organization criteria. Regarding toxicity, we considered both hematologic (anemia,
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) and nonhematologic
(nausea and vomiting) grade 3 and 4 side effects of
treatment.
Data Extraction
Two independent reviewers extracted data by filling in an
appropriate form. Mismatches between reviewers were
resolved through an independent review by a third investigator. The following data were collected from the identified trials: first author name, journal and year of
publication, age of patients, drugs used and administration doses, number of patients, 1-year SR, ORR, and percentage of patients who experienced grade 3 and 4
toxicities.

following as ‘‘events’’: for the 1-year SR, death; for the
ORR, nonresponse; for grade 3 and 4 adverse effects, toxicity. We also calculated 95% confidence interval (95%
CI) for each. The ORs were significant when the value 1
was not within the 95% CI. ORs <1.0 indicated a benefit
of the doublet over the single agent and, consequently, a
higher SR, a higher response rate, and less toxicity. A
pooled OR for each outcome was computed by using
fixed-effects or random-effects models according to the
Mantel-Haenszel method. The heterogeneity between trials was tested using the Cochran Q test. To allow an easier
interpretation of the results, the difference in risk between
investigational and control arms was calculated.

Statistical Analysis
Data from selected trials were analyzed using NCSS software (2007 version; Kaysville, Utah). The doublet was
considered an investigational treatment, and the single
agent was used as a control treatment. When a trial compared >2 different chemotherapy regimens, the investigational or control arm was counted twice or more in the
analysis, so that the number of comparisons was greater
than the number of included trials.
The outcomes were represented by dichotomous
variables: The 1-year SR was calculated by applying an
intent-to-treat analysis; ORR and grade 3 and 4 toxicity
analyses were performed by considering the number of
patients evaluable for response and toxicity, respectively.
The differences in efficacy and toxicity between treatment
arms were standardized through odds ratios (ORs) of an
‘‘event’’ for each treatment outcome. We considered the

RESULTS
From the 442 potentially relevant trials, 414 trials were
considered ineligible because they did not include elderly
patients, and 1 trial was ineligible because no detailed data
were available. The remaining 27 trials were analyzed
accurately, and 23 were excluded from meta-analysis (8
were not phase 3 trials, 3 included pretreated patients, 11
did not include treatment with a third-generation doublet
versus a single agent, and 1 was published twice). A full
description of the ineligible and excluded trials is available
from the authors on request. After the selection procedure, 4 trials16,19-21 that included 1436 patients (603 in
the investigational arms and 833 in the control arms) were
analyzed (Fig. 1). The lower age limit was 65 years in only
1 of the 4 trials that were included and 70 years in the
remaining 3 trials. Because several trials had >2 eligible

DISCUSSION
In this retrospective subgroup analyses of studies that used
platinum combination chemotherapy, the selected elderly
patients who were eligible for aggressive treatment, who

represented a minority of the study population, had
outcomes similar to those achieved by their younger
counterparts with acceptable hematologic and nonhematologic side effects.8-10 The age-related reduction in
the functional reserve of many organs and/or comorbidities may contraindicate cisplatin-based regimens in nonselected elderly patients because of concern regarding
patients’ tolerability. Cisplatin has a low therapeutic
ratio with significant toxicities, including nausea and
vomiting, renal function impairment requiring adequate
hydration, ototoxicity, and neuropathy. Carboplatin
administration causes lower rates of nonhematologic side
effects, although it produces more profound myelosuppression, especially in combination with other myelotoxic
agents.22
Single-agent chemotherapy (gemcitabine, vinorelbine, or taxanes) was studied first and is the approach preferred by several oncologists for the treatment of
nonselected elderly patients with advanced NSCLC.12,13
To minimize chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression,
weekly schedules have been investigated in many studies,
especially when taxanes were administered. We planned
the current meta-analysis to evaluate whether third-generation doublets could provide better results than single
agents without the increased occurrence of severe
toxicities.
The heterogeneity in data regarding age and elderly
assessment among the reviewed studies reflects the selection bias of the available elderly specific, randomized
phase 3 trials. In 2 of the selected studies,19,21 patients
with poor performance status were included together with
elderly patients, leading to a heterogeneous study population. Overall, a bad performance status predicts worse survival.23 This selection bias should not particularly affect
our findings because of the small percentage of younger
patients who had a performance status of 2 among those
enrolled in these studies.
Unfortunately, none of the studies that were analyzed in this meta-analysis reported whether CGA was
used to evaluate the elderly patients on study before
enrollment, although this may support the generalizability
of our results to an unselected elderly population. In performing a meta-analysis based on published data, only the
issues investigated by the authors can be analyzed. Furthermore, all of the selected trials started when CGA was
not used routinely in clinical practice.

Because of its favorable toxicity profile, its proven efficacy, and its synergistic action with other third-generation
agents, gemcitabine was chosen for third-generation combination regimens in randomized phase 3 trials that were
dedicated to elderly patients with advanced NSCLC. It is
noteworthy that all of the platinum-free combinations that
were selected for this meta-analysis contained gemcitabine.
Even if contradictory results were reported from
prospective trials that compared third-generation doublets
and single agents, our meta-analysis indicates a significantly increased response rate with gemcitabine-based regimens over single-agent chemotherapy and a clear trend
toward an improved 1-year SR, although the latter
improvement missed statistical significance. A possible explanation for the lack of significance in the 1-year SR may
rely on the use in the largest study of 20% lower doses of
gemcitabine and vinorelbine in combination compared
with the doses administered in the other studies that tested
the same doublet. It is possible that, with more homogeneous dosages and larger samples, a significant result may
have been achieved.
With regard to tolerability, only data on hematologic toxicities and nausea and vomiting were available, so
that no definitive conclusion could be drawn. The rate of
severe hematologic toxicities, as expected, increased when
a second drug was added to gemcitabine, but only grade 3
and 4 thrombocytopenia was associated significantly with
doublet regimens.
The analysis of available literature performed for
this review confirmed the absolute urgency of prospective
randomized clinical trials dedicated to elderly patients
with NSCLC to guide therapeutic decisions. Further trials
comparing platinum-based and nonplatinum-based regimens in the elderly already are ongoing and are using
adapted doses and schedules to obtain an effective and
well tolerated treatment.
With regard to the administration of new drugs, the
available data from retrospective subset analyses of large
randomized trials do not support their ordinary use. Bevacizumab does not appear to be particularly suitable for
elderly patients, because it may be too toxic24; whereas
pemetrexed and erlotinib, although they demonstrated
similar survival and toxicity rates between older and
younger patients, were studied in a highly selected patients
who had received previous platinum-based chemotherapy
and were eligible for second-line therapy.25,26
1929

Original Article

Although our analysis suggests that gemcitabinebased doublets should be considered for first-line chemotherapy for such elderly populations, it must be taken into
account that an overestimation of treatment effects is possible when a meta-analysis is not based on individual
patient data. Performing a meta-analysis using individual
patient data certainly would have provided more rigorous
results, even if it would have required greater human, material, and perhaps financial means.
