Abstract
The c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase and its ligand, hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF), have been implicated in the progression
of several human cancers and are attractive therapeutic
targets. PF-2341066 was identified as a potent, orally bioavailable, ATP-competitive small-molecule inhibitor of the catalytic activity of c-Met kinase. PF-2341066 was selective for
c-Met (and anaplastic lymphoma kinase) compared with a
panel of >120 diverse tyrosine and serine-threonine kinases.
PF-2341066 potently inhibited c-Met phosphorylation and
c-Met–dependent proliferation, migration, or invasion of
human tumor cells in vitro (IC50 values, 5–20 nmol/L). In
addition, PF-2341066 potently inhibited HGF-stimulated
endothelial cell survival or invasion and serum-stimulated
tubulogenesis in vitro, suggesting that this agent also exhibits
antiangiogenic properties. PF-2341066 showed efficacy at
well-tolerated doses, including marked cytoreductive antitumor activity, in several tumor models that expressed activated
c-Met. The antitumor efficacy of PF-2341066 was dose
dependent and showed a strong correlation to inhibition of
c-Met phosphorylation in vivo. Near-maximal inhibition of
c-Met activity for the full dosing interval was necessary to
maximize the efficacy of PF-2341066. Additional mechanismof-action studies showed dose-dependent inhibition of c-Met–
dependent signal transduction, tumor cell proliferation
(Ki67), induction of apoptosis (caspase-3), and reduction of
microvessel density (CD31). These results indicated that the
antitumor activity of PF-2341066 may be mediated by direct
effects on tumor cell growth or survival as well as antiangiogenic mechanisms. Collectively, these results show the
therapeutic potential of targeting c-Met with selective smallmolecule inhibitors for the treatment of human cancers.

Introduction
An emerging paradigm in oncology is that robust clinical efficacy
can be obtained with inhibitors directed toward oncogenic
receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) that are mutated or otherwise

dysregulated in selected advanced tumors (1, 2). Recent examples
of successful therapeutic intervention with RTK inhibitors include
imatinib in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) with mutant
c-Kit, erlotinib in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with mutant
and/or amplified epidermal growth factor receptor, trastuzumab in
breast cancers with amplified/elevated HER-2, and sunitinib
targeting the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-dependent vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway in renal cell carcinoma
(RCC; ref. 3). In addition to the aforementioned RTKs, c-Met is one
of most frequently genetically altered or otherwise dysregulated
RTKs in advanced cancers, implicating it as an attractive
therapeutic target (4).
c-Met is the prototypic member of a subfamily of RTKs, which
also includes RON. c-Met is structurally distinct from other RTKs
and is the only known high-affinity receptor for hepatocyte growth
factor (HGF), also known as scatter factor (SF; refs. 5, 6). Binding
of HGF to the c-Met extracellular domain results in receptor
multimerization and phosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues
at the intracellular region (5, 6). Tyrosine phosphorylation at the
c-Met juxtamembrane, catalytic, and cytoplasmic domains regulate
the internalization, catalytic activity, and docking of regulatory
substrates, respectively (6–9). Activation of c-Met results in the
binding and phosphorylation of adaptor proteins, such as growth
factor receptor binding protein 2 (Grb2)–associated binding
protein 1 (Gab1), Grb2, Src homology and collagen (Shc), and
c-Cbl and subsequent activation of signal transducers such as
phosphoinositide-3-kinase, Akt, peritoneal lymphocyte-g (PLC-g),
signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT), and
extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1 and 2; ref. 10).
c-Met and HGF are expressed in numerous tissues, and their
expression is normally confined predominantly to cells of epithelial
and mesenchymal origin, respectively (11, 12). c-Met and HGF have
been shown to be important in epithelial-mesenchymal interaction
and regulation of cell migration, invasion, cell proliferation and
survival, angiogenesis, morphogenic differentiation, and organization of three-dimensional tubular structures (e.g., renal tubular
cells) during mammalian development and tissue repair and
homeostasis (10, 13–16).
Although the controlled regulation of c-Met and HGF have been
shown to be important in mammalian development and tissue
homeostasis, their dysregulation is implicated in metastatic cancer
progression. c-Met and HGF are highly expressed relative to
surrounding tissue in numerous cancers, and their expression
correlates with poor patient prognosis (10). c-Met–activating point
mutations in the kinase domain are implicated as the cause of
hereditary papillary renal carcinoma and were also detected in
sporadic papillary renal carcinoma, lung cancers, head and neck

cancers, childhood hepatocellular carcinoma, and gastric cancer
(17–22). Furthermore, amplification of the c-Met gene locus was
detected in patients with gastric, metastatic colorectal cancer, and
esophageal adenocarcinoma (23, 24). Cell lines engineered to
express high levels of c-Met and HGF (autocrine loop) or mutant
c-Met displayed a proliferative, motogenic, and/or invasive
phenotype and grew as metastatic tumors in nude mice (25–29).
Furthermore, HGF and c-Met have been implicated in the
regulation of tumor angiogenesis through the direct proangiogenic
properties of HGF or through the regulation of secretion of
angiogenic factors, including VEGFA, interleukin-8 (IL-8), and
thrombospondin-1 (30–33).
Although a number of inhibitors of the c-Met pathway have been
identified, including HGF kringle variants/NK4, decoy receptors, or
HGF neutralizing antibodies, the therapeutic utility of these
approaches still requires clinical validation (4). Previously
described small-molecule inhibitors of c-Met (e.g., SU11274 or
PHA-665752) have been limited to in vitro studies or brief in vivo
studies and were not viable clinical agents due to poor
pharmaceutical properties and oral bioavailability (34). The present
studies describe the identification and characterization of
PF-2341066, an orally available ATP-competitive and selective
small-molecule inhibitor of c-Met. PF-2341066 potently inhibited
c-Met phosphorylation and signal transduction, as well as c-Met–
dependent oncogenic phenotypes of tumor cells and endothelial
cells in vitro and showed antitumor efficacy in tumor models at
well-tolerated doses in vivo. Antitumor mechanism-of-action
studies indicated that the antitumor activity of PF-2341066 may
be mediated by both direct effects on tumor cell growth or survival,
as well as antiangiogenic mechanisms.

Materials and Methods
Compound
PF-2341066 [(R)-3-[1-(2,6-dichloro-3-fluoro-phenyl)-ethoxy]-5-(1-piperidin-4-yl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-pyridin-2-ylamine; Supplementary Fig. S1] was
synthesized at Pfizer, La Jolla Laboratories.

Biochemical Kinase Assays
c-Met catalytic activity was quantitated using a continuous-coupled
spectrophotometric assay in which the time-dependent production of ADP
by c-Met was determined by analysis of the rate of consumption of NADH.
NADH consumption was measured by a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm
by spectrophotometry at designated time points. To determine K i values,
PF-2341066 was introduced into test wells at various concentrations in the
presence of assay reagents and incubated for 10 min at 37jC. The assay was
initiated by the addition of the c-Met enzyme.

Cells
Unless otherwise mentioned, cells were acquired from the American
Type Culture Collection. GTL-16 gastric carcinoma cells and T47D breast
carcinoma cells engineered to express human wild-type c-Met or its mutant
variant c-Met Y1235D were donated by Dr. Paolo Comoglio or Dr.
Mariaflavia DiRenzo (both from the University Torino Medical School,
Candiolo, Italy), respectively. All cells were cultured in recommended media
and serum concentration, and unless otherwise indicated, cell culture
reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Cells were maintained
at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere with 5% to 10% CO2 and maintained
using standard cell culture techniques.

Antibodies and Growth Factors
Anti–total human c-Met was acquired from Zymed/Invitrogen. AntiCD31 and anti–phospho-tyrosine (PY-20) were acquired from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. Anti-mouse c-Met was acquired from R&D Systems. Anti–

phospho–c-Met; anti–total and phospho-Gab1; anti–total and phospho-Akt;
anti–total and phospho-ERK1 and 2; and STAT5 were acquired from Cell
Signaling Technologies. Antibodies used in immunohistochemistry studies
included anti–phospho-c-Met (Biosource International/Invitrogen) and
anti-Ki67 (DakoCytomation). Growth factors used in cell assays were each
acquired from R&D Systems.

Cell Assays
All experiments were done under standard conditions (37jC and 5%
CO2). IC50 values were calculated by concentration-response curve fitting
using a Microsoft Excel–based four-parameter method.
Cellular kinase phosphorylation ELISA assays. Cells were seeded in
96-well plates in media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
and transferred to serum-free media [with 0.04% bovine serum albumin
(BSA)] after 24 h. In experiments investigating ligand-dependent RTK
phosphorylation, corresponding growth factors were added for up to
20 min. After incubation of cells with PF-2341066 for 1 h and/or appropriate
ligands for the designated times, cells were washed once with HBSS
supplemented with 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, and protein lysates were generated
from cells. Subsequently, phosphorylation of selected protein kinases was
assessed by a sandwich ELISA method using specific capture antibodies
used to coat 96-well plates and a detection antibody specific for
phosphorylated tyrosine residues. Antibody-coated plates were (a) incubated in the presence of protein lysates at 4jC overnight; (b) washed seven
times in 1% Tween 20 in PBS; (c) incubated in a horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated anti–total-phosphotyrosine (PY-20) antibody (1:500) for 30 min;
(d) washed seven times again; (e) incubated in 3,3¶,5,5¶-tetramethyl
benzidine peroxidase substrate (Bio-Rad) to initiate a colorimetric reaction
that was stopped by adding 0.09 N H2SO4; and ( f ) measured for absorbance
in 450 nm using a spectrophotometer.
Cell proliferation/survival assays. Tumor cells were seeded in 96-well
plates at low density in media supplemented with 10% FBS (growth media)
and transferred to serum-free media (0% FBS and 0.04% BSA) after 24 h.
Appropriate controls or designated concentrations of PF-2341066 were
added to each well, and cells were incubated for 24 to 72 h. Human
umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) (passage 3) were seeded in 96well plates in EGM2 media for 5 to 6 h at >20,000 cells per well and
transferred to serum-free media (Cell Applications) overnight. The following
day, appropriate controls or designated concentrations of PF-2341066 were
added to each well, and after 1 h incubation, HGF was added to designated
wells at 100 ng/mL. A 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide assay (Promega) was done to determine the relative tumor cell or
HUVEC numbers.
Tumor cell migration and Matrigel invasion assays. NCI-H441 cell
migration and Matrigel invasion were determined using a modified
commercially available kit (BD Biosciences). Briefly, cells in log growth
phase were trypsinized and suspended in serum-free media (with 0.04%
BSA) at a density of 400,000 cells/mL. Designated control or treated
suspended cells (0.5 mL) were added to each migration or invasion chamber
(i.e., plate inserts) and incubated at 37jC for 22 h. In addition, 25 ng/mL
HGF (0.75 mL) was added to the lower well of each companion plate to
attract cells from migration or invasion chamber plate inserts at the top of
the companion plate. Cells that invaded or migrated to the lower wells were
then fixed and stained with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 15 min at
37jC and washed twice with TBS, and the number of invading cells was
quantitated using Image-Pro Plus software over a composite of five
microscopic images (Media Cybernetics).
HUVEC Matrigel invasion assay. ACEA electrosensing 96-well plates
were coated with 50 AL of 0.001% fibronectin and 100 ng/mL HGF in PBS
and incubated at 37jC for 1 h and then at 4jC for 30 min. After washing
each plate with PBS at 4jC, Matrigel (BD Biosciences) diluted 1:40 in
starvation media (Cell Applications), supplemented with HGF (100 ng/mL)
and/or different concentrations of PF-2341066, was added (50 AL) to
designated wells and allowed to solidify at 37jC for 2 h. HUVEC were
subsequently collected in starvation media at 60,000 cells/mL and treated
with 100 ng/mL HGF and/or designated concentrations of PF-2341066 for
30 min at 37jC, and 100 AL of suspended cells were transferred to the top of

the Matrigel layer in the coated ACEA plate. The ACEA plate was connected
to the ACEA Device Station at 37jC, and HUVEC that invaded through
Matrigel were monitored in real time by an ACEA Sensor Analyzer for
48 h and quantitated using ACEA RT-CES Integrated Software.
Madin-Darby canine kidney cell scattering assay. Madin-Darby
canine kidney cell (MDCK) scattering assays were done as described
previously (34).
Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells vascular sprouting
assay. Approximately 500 human dermal microvascular endothelial cells
(HMVEC) (Clonetics) were added to EGM-2 medium containing 0.24%
methylcellulose and transferred to U-bottomed 96-well plates to form
spheroids overnight. Spheroids were supplemented with 2 mg/mL
fibrinogen and 4% FBS with vehicle or designated concentrations of
PF-2341066 in 48-well thrombin-coated plates and incubated in EGM-2
containing 4% FBS at 37jC and 5% CO2. Endothelial tube formation was
assessed, and images were captured on day 7 with an inverted microscope
and Olympus BX60 digital camera.
Apoptosis assay. GTL-16 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 40,000
cells per well. Designated concentrations of PF-2341066 or vehicle were
added to the wells in serum-free media, and cells were incubated in 37jC
and 5% CO2 for 48 h. The ssDNA Apoptosis ELISA kit (Chemicon) was used
to detect apoptosis.

In vivo Studies
Animals. Female or male nu/nu mice (5–8 weeks old) were obtained
from Charles River. Animals were maintained under clean room conditions
in sterile filter top cages with Alpha-Dri bedding and housed on highefficiency particulate air–filtered ventilated racks. Animals received sterile
rodent chow and water ad libitum. All of the procedures were conducted in
accordance with the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and with Pfizer Animal Care and Use
Committee guidelines.
S.c. xenograft models in athymic mice. Cells were harvested, pelleted
by centrifugation at 450  g for 5 to 10 min, and resuspended in sterile
serum-free medium supplemented with 30% to 50% Matrigel (BD
Biosciences). Cells (2–5  106 in 100 AL) were implanted s.c. into the
hind-flank region of each mouse and allowed to grow to the designated size
before the administration of compound. For studies with NCI-H441, DLD-1,
and MDA-MB-231 xenografts, MRC-5 cells were added to tumor cells at a
2:1 ratio (tumor cells/MRC-5) before implantation as a source of bioactive
human HGF.
c-Met pharmacodynamic and signal transduction studies. Athymic
mice bearing xenografts (300–800 mm3)were given PF-2341066 in water by
oral gavage at designated dose levels. At designated times following PF2341066 administration, mice were humanely euthanized, and tumors were
resected. Tumors were snap frozen and pulverized using a liquid nitrogencooled cryomortar and pestle, protein lysates were generated, and protein
concentrations were determined using a BSA assay (Pierce). The level of
total and phosphorylated protein was determined using a capture ELISA or
immunoprecipitation-immunoblotting method.
Efficacy studies. Daily treatment with PF-2341066 given in water by oral
gavage was initiated when tumors were 100 to 600 mm3 in volume. Tumor
volume was determined by measurement with electronic Vernier calipers,
and tumor volume was calculated as the product of its length  width2 
0.4. Tumor volume was expressed on indicated days as the median tumor
volume F SE indicated for groups of mice. Percent (%) inhibition values
were measured on the final day of study for drug-treated compared with
vehicle-treated mice and are calculated as 100  {1 [(TreatedFinal day
ControlDay 1)]}. Tumor regression values
TreatedDay 1)/(ControlFinal day
were determined by calculating the ratio of median tumor volumes at the
time when treatment was initiated to median tumor volume on the final
day of study for a given treatment group. Significant differences between the
treated versus the control groups (P V 0.001) were determined using oneway ANOVA.
Immunohistochemistry. Tumor specimens were fixed in 10% buffered
formalin for 24 h before being transferred to 70% ethanol. Tumor samples
were subsequently paraffin-embedded, and 4 Amol/L sections were cut and

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (9). May 1, 2007

baked onto microscope slides. Slides were incubated with the primary
antibodies then secondary antibodies and visualized using a colorimetric
method (DAB kit; DAO Envision-HARP). All of the immunostained sections
were counterstained using hematoxylin. An automated Ventana Discovery
XT Staining Module (Ventana Medical Systems) was used to conduct
histologic staining. Stained sections were analyzed using an Olympus
microscope, and quantitative analysis of section staining was done using
the ACIS system (Automated Cellular Imaging, Clarient).

Results
PF-2341066 potently inhibited the catalytic activity of c-Met
and its oncogenic variants in vitro. PF-2341066 (Supplementary
Fig. S1) was selected for further characterization based on screens
designed to identify inhibitors of c-Met. PF-2341066 was shown
to be a potent ATP-competitive inhibitor of recombinant, human
c-Met kinase activity with a mean K i of 4 nmol/L. In cell-based
assays, PF-2341066 inhibited HGF-stimulated or constitutive total
tyrosine phosphorylation of wild-type c-Met, with a mean IC50
value of 11 nmol/L across a panel of human tumor and endothelial
cell lines (Supplementary Table S1). PF-2341066 showed similar
potency against c-Met phosphorylation in mIMCD3 mouse (IC50,
5 nmol/L) or MDCK canine (IC50, 20 nmol/L) epithelial cells.
c-Met–activating mutations have been identified in several
human cancers and provide a strong rationale for clinical proof
of concept studies. To address differences in potency against
mutant variants of c-Met, PF-2341066 was evaluated for its ability
to inhibit c-Met phosphorylation across a panel of cell lines
expressing c-Met mutations (Supplementary Table S1). In these
studies, PF-2341066 exhibited improved or similar activity against
NIH3T3 cells engineered to express c-Met ATP-binding site
mutants V1092I (IC50, 19 nmol/L) or H1094R (IC50, 2 nmol/L) or
the P-loop mutant M1250T (IC50, 15 nmol/L) compared with
NIH3T3 cells expressing wild-type receptor (IC50, 13 nmol/L). In
contrast, a marked shift in potency was observed against cells
engineered to express c-Met activation loop mutants Y1230C (IC50,
127 nmol/L) and Y1235D (IC50, 92 nmol/L) compared with wildtype receptor. PF-2341066 also potently inhibited c-Met phosphorylation in NCI-H69 (IC50, 13 nmol/L) and HOP92 (IC50, 16 nmol/L)
cells, which express the endogenous c-Met variants R988C and
T1010I, respectively.
Kinase selectivity of PF-2341066. PF-2341066 was evaluated in
>120 biochemical kinase assays done at Upstate, Inc., or Pfizer and
was determined to be more than 100-fold selective for c-Met
compared with the majority (>90%) of kinases evaluated (data not
shown). In cell-based assays to follow up initial biochemical data,
PF-2341066 was >1,000-fold selective for the VEGFR2 and PDGFRh
RTKs, >250-fold selective for IRK and Lck, and f40- to 60-fold
selective for Tie2, TrkA, and TrkB, all compared with c-Met
(Supplementary Table S1). PF-2341066 was 20- to 30-fold selective
for RON and Axl RTKs (Supplementary Table S1), however;
pharmacologically relevant inhibitory activity (proposed as IC90
for 24 h) is unlikely to be achieved at efficacious doses of PF2341066 based on assessment of in vivo pharmacodynamics for
other RTK targets (data not shown). In contrast, PF-2341066
showed a near-equivalent IC50 value (24 nmol/L) against the
nucleophosmin (NPM)-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) oncogenic fusion variant of the ALK RTK expressed by the KARPAS299
human anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) cell line. These data
indicate that the pharmacologic activity of PF-2341066 is likely
mediated by the inhibition of c-Met and ALK RTKs and their
oncogenic variants. The pharmacologic properties of PF-02341066

Figure 1. PF-2341066 inhibited HMVEC
endothelial cell tubulogenesis in vitro.
HMVEC cells were plated as spheroids in a
collagen-fibrin matrix, and subsequent
endothelial cell tubulogenesis was
observed within 7 d following initial plating.
PF-2341066 was added to spheroid
cultures at day 7 at the indicated
concentrations, and the effect on the
number and length of endothelial cell
tubules was visually assessed.

in models of NPM-ALK–positive lymphoma will be described
elsewhere.7
PF-2341066 inhibited c-Met–dependent neoplastic phenotypes of cancer cells and angiogenic phenotypes of endothelial
cells in vitro. Because c-Met is implicated in a variety of tumor cell
and tumor endothelial cell functions, PF-2341066 was evaluated in
a series of cell-based functional assays. PF-2341066 inhibited
human GTL-16 gastric carcinoma cell growth (IC50, 9.7 nmol/L),
induced apoptosis in GTL-16 cells (IC50, 8.4 nmol/L), inhibited
HGF-stimulated human NCI-H441 lung carcinoma cell migration
and invasion (Supplementary Fig. S2, IC50s of 11 and 6.1 nmol/L,
respectively), and inhibited MDCK cell scattering (IC50, 16 nmol/L;
Supplementary Table S2).
In studies done using HUVEC, PF-2341066 inhibited HGFstimulated c-Met phosphorylation (IC50, 11 nmol/L), cell survival
(IC50, 14 nmol/L), and Matrigel invasion (IC50, 35 nmol/L;
Supplementary Table S2). In addition, PF-2341066 inhibited
serum-stimulated HMVEC branching tubulogenesis ( formation of
vascular tubes) in fibrin gels (Fig. 1). The strong correlation of
IC50 values for inhibition of c-Met phosphorylation and c-Met–
dependent phenotypes suggests that PF-2341066 pharmacologic
activity in these assays is mediated by the inhibition of c-Met.
Dose-dependent relationship of c-Met phosphorylation and
tumor growth inhibition by PF-2341066 in c-Met–dependent
tumor xenograft models. Due to the robust expression of
constitutively active c-Met and dependence of c-Met for tumor cell
growth and survival, GTL-16 tumors were used to evaluate the
relationship of c-Met target inhibition to tumor growth inhibition by
PF-2341066 in vivo. To evaluate c-Met inhibition by PF-2341066, GTL16 tumors were harvested at several time points following p.o.
administration of PF-2341066 over a range of doses, and c-Met
phosphorylation in tumors was quantitated by ELISA. In these
studies, PF-2341066 showed the following as shown in Fig. 2 (A and B):

At 50 mg/kg/day, 100% tumor growth inhibition correlated
with complete inhibition of c-Met phosphorylation in GTL-16
tumors sustained for 24 h. At dose levels of >50 mg/kg/day, no
further improvement of tumor growth inhibition was observed
(data not shown).
 At 12.5 mg/kg/day, 60% tumor growth inhibition correlated
with 80% to 90% inhibition of c-Met phosphorylation at 1 to 8 h,
which decreased to 50% to 60% inhibition by 16 to 24 h.
 At 6.25 mg/kg/day, nonsignificant trend toward tumor growth
inhibition correlated with 30% to 50% inhibition of c-Met
phosphorylation at 1 to 8 h with full recovery by 16 h.
The following conclusions were apparent from these analyses:
(a) complete inhibition of c-Met activity for 24 h is consistent with
complete inhibition of tumor growth [50 mg/kg; 100% tumor
growth inhibition (TGI)]; (b) potent inhibition of c-Met activity
for only a portion of the schedule is consistent with suboptimal
efficacy (12.5 mg/kg; 60% TGI); (c) inability to achieve >50%
inhibition of c-Met activity (3.125, 6.25 mg/kg) is consistent with
lack of significant TGI (Fig. 2A and B). In addition, a similar dosedependent effect of PF-2341066 on tumor growth and c-Met
phosphorylation (at 4 h) was observed using the U87MG
glioblastoma xenograft model (Fig. 2C and D). Collectively, these
studies suggest that near-complete inhibition of c-Met phosphorylation (>90% inhibition) for the duration of the administration
schedule is necessary to maximize therapeutic benefit.
Antitumor efficacy of PF-2341066 in c-Met–dependent
human xenograft models. Additional studies were done at
optimal dose levels of PF-2341066 to assess its efficacy in human
tumor xenograft models representative of cancer indications in
which dysregulation of c-Met is implicated. Due to the lack of
paracrine activation of human c-Met expressed in tumors by
mouse HGF expressed by mouse mesenchymal cells, human
xenograft models exhibiting constitutive c-Met activity were used
as follows: (a) the GTL-16 human gastric carcinoma or Caki-1 RCC
models that expresses elevated levels of constitutively active c-Met;
(b) the U87MG human glioblastoma or PC-3 human prostate
carcinoma model that expresses both HGF and c-Met comprising
an autocrine loop; or (c) coimplantation of human tumor cells

cancer) with human MRC5 fibroblasts to supply a source of
bioactive human HGF to enable species-specific paracrine
activation of c-Met.
In the GTL-16 model, PF-2341066 showed the ability to cause
marked regression of large established tumors (>600 mm3) in both
the 50 and 75 mg/kg/day treatment cohorts, with a 60% decrease in
mean tumor volume over the 43-day administration schedule
(Fig. 3A). In the GTL-16 study, each tumor decreased in volume
during the treatment cycle (50 or 75 mg/kg/day), with 9 of 14 mice
exhibiting a >30% decrease in tumor mass and one animal
exhibiting no evidence of tumor even after cessation of treatment
for 10 days (Fig. 3A). In an additional study, PF-2341066 showed the
ability to completely suppress GTL-16 tumor growth for >3 months,
with only 1 of 12 mice exhibiting a significant increase in tumor
growth over the 3-month treatment schedule at 50 mg/kg/day
(data not shown).
In the NCI-H441 NSCLC model, a 43% decrease in mean tumor
volume was observed at 50 mg/kg/day during the 38-day PF2341066 administration cycle (Fig. 3B). In the NCI-H441 study, each
tumor decreased in mass during the treatment cycle at 50 mg/kg/
day, with 3 of 11 mice exhibiting a >30% decrease in tumor mass,
and 3 animals with no evidence of tumor at the end of the
treatment cycle. In the Caki-1 RCC model, a 53% decrease in mean
tumor volume was observed associated with decreased volume of
each tumor by at least 30% at 50 mg/kg/day during the 33-day
PF-2341066 administration cycle (Fig. 3C).
PF-2341066 also showed near-complete inhibition of the growth
of established tumors at 50 mg/kg/day in the U87MG glioblastoma
or PC-3 prostate carcinoma xenograft models, with 97% or 84%
inhibition on the final study day, respectively (Figs. 2D and 3D). In
contrast, PF-2341066 p.o. given at 50 mg/kg/day did not

significantly inhibit tumor growth in the MDA-MB-231 breast
carcinoma model, or the DLD-1 colon carcinoma model (data not
shown). In each study, PF-2341066 was well tolerated at 50 mg/kg/
day for as long as 3 months or at 200 mg/kg/day for as long as
1 month, with no weight loss or evidence of overt toxicity or
histopathologic findings. Collective in vivo experiments showed
robust dose-dependent antitumor efficacy of PF-2341066 at welltolerated dose levels in a variety of diverse tumor models, which
correlated with the degree of inhibition of c-Met phosphorylation
in tumor tissue.
PF-2341066 mechanism of action in c-Met–dependent
tumor models. PF-2341066 was also evaluated for its effect on
tumor mitotic index (Ki67) and apoptosis (activated caspase-3)
using immunohistochemical (IHC) methods. A significant 4-fold
decrease in Ki67 levels by study day 4 was observed at 25 and
50 mg/kg/day PF-2341066 in the GTL-16 (Fig. 4A–C) and U87MG
(data not shown) models indicating a correlation with maximum
antitumor efficacy. In addition, the evaluation of the 50 mg/kg
dose over a time course indicated that the inhibition of
mitogenesis was markedly more potent at days 3 and 4,
suggesting that extended target inhibition maximizes this
potentially cell cycle–dependent effect (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, a
qualitative induction of activated caspase-3 at 25 and 50 mg/kg/
day was observed in the GTL-16 model and at 50 mg/kg/day in
the U87MG model (Supplementary Fig. S3). Similar to the
modulation of Ki67, the increased apoptosis was dose dependent
and correlated with the degree of antitumor efficacy of PF2341066 (data not shown).
To evaluate the potential antiangiogenic mechanism of this
compound in vivo, PF-2341066 was evaluated for time- and dosedependent modulation of microvessel density (MVD) assessed by
immunostaining for CD31 (platelet endothelial cell adhesion

molecule 1). A significant dose-dependent reduction of CD31–
positive endothelial cells was observed at 12.5, 25, and 50 mg/kg/
day in GTL-16 tumors, indicating that inhibition of MVD showed a
dose-dependent correlation to antitumor efficacy (Fig. 5A and B).
At the 50 mg/kg/day dose level, PF-02340166 showed a significant
70% reduction of CD31-positive microvessels at study day 11 (Fig.
5A and B). In contrast, the effect on MVD was less apparent in the
short-term time course study, suggesting that reduction of MVD
requires longer term administration. In contrast to the GTL-16
model, only slight effects on MVD were observed in the U87MG
model, suggesting that this potential antiangiogenic mechanism
depends on tumor type.
c-Met and HGF have also been shown to regulate the secretion of
proangiogenic factors, including VEGFA and IL-8 by tumor cells
(32, 33). Therefore, the effect of PF-2341066 on VEGFA and IL8 plasma levels was assessed to elucidate whether the effects on
MVD observed following the administration of PF-2341066 were
due to direct or indirect effects on tumor vessels. In these studies,
PF-2341066 showed a significant dose-dependent reduction of
human VEGFA and IL-8 plasma levels in both the GTL-16 and
U87MG models (U87MG, Fig. 5C). Human VEGFA and IL-8 were
not present in the plasma of non–tumor-bearing mice, indicating
that the source of these plasma proteins was the tumor tissue (data
not shown). A significant acute reduction of IL-8 or VEGFA plasma
levels was observed after 1 or 2 days of PF-2341066 administration,
respectively, in mice with size-matched tumor xenografts, indicating that observed effects were not due to differences in tumor
burden (Fig. 5D).

marked inhibition of phosphorylated c-Met, Akt, Erk, PLCE1, and
STAT5 levels was observed in GTL-16 tumors following p.o.
administration of PF-2341066 (Fig. 6). Inhibition of these signaling
events was dose dependent and was observed at pharmacologically
relevant PF-2341066 dose levels, which correlated with the
inhibition of c-Met phosphorylation, antitumor efficacy, and other
mechanistic end points in vivo (Fig. 6).

Discussion
In the present studies, we describe a novel orally available
inhibitor of c-Met and the consequences of inhibiting this RTK
target in a variety of functional assays and tumor models. This
prototype small molecule, PF-2341066, was identified as a potent
ATP-competitive inhibitor of c-Met kinase, which inhibited c-Met
phosphorylation across a panel of cell lines. The similar inhibitory
activity against c-Met human and mouse epithelial cells has
implications for interpreting potential antiangiogenic activity and
safety profile of PF-2341066 during studies in tumor xenograft
models in mice.
The clinical success with RTK inhibitors such as imatinib and
erlotinib in patient populations exhibiting mutated RTK targets
indicates that treatment of neoplasms with activating Met
mutations comprises a viable clinical strategy for PF-2341066. PF2341066 inhibited a variety of diverse mutant variants of c-Met in
cellular assays, including those located at the ATP binding pocket
(V1092I and H1094R), P-loop (M1250T), and juxtamembrane
domain (R988C and T1010I). In contrast, PF-2341066 was less
potent against the Y1230C and Y1235D mutant variants of c-Met
located near the kinase domain activation loop. These data
indicate that PF-2341066 activity is dependent on the location of

the mutation in the active site, which has unique implications in
molecular modeling of c-Met inhibitory activity. These data
indicate that selected mutations identified in papillary renal
carcinoma, head and neck, and lung cancers are effectively
inhibited by PF-2341066, and that particular mutations (e.g.,
activation loop) should be taken into account during patient
selection (17, 19, 20, 22).
Evaluation of PF-2341066 across a structurally diverse crosssection of nearly 25% of all known tyrosine and serine-threonine
kinases (35) indicated that it exhibited a high degree of selectivity
at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. The exception to
this was ALK, which was inhibited at pharmacologically relevant
(24 nmol/L) concentrations by PF-2341066 in lymphoma cell lines
expressing the NPM-ALK oncogenic fusion protein. Similar to BCRAbl in chronic myelogenous leukemia, available literature indicates
that ALK fusion proteins are a key disease driver of ALCL (36). In
the present studies, disease models selected for study of c-Met–
dependent pharmacology generally do not express ALK, suggesting
that the pharmacologic activity of PF-2341066 is likely due to the
inhibition of c-Met. However, due to the expression of wild-type
ALK in selected endothelial cell populations, the relevance of ALK
in mediating the pharmacologic activity of PF-2341066 cannot be
discounted (37, 38).
The identification of PF-2341066 as a potent and selective
inhibitor of c-Met provided some unique opportunities to
investigate the pharmacologic consequences of c-Met inhibition.
With the strong correlation between IC50 values required for
inhibition of c-Met phosphorylation and tumor or endothelial cell
phenotypes, the present studies suggest that the pharmacologic
effects of PF-2341066 are due to the inhibition of c-Met. These
collective phenotypic data indicate that potential anticancer effects

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (9). May 1, 2007

of PF-2341066 may range from (a) direct effects on tumor cell
growth and survival to (b) antimetastatic properties through
inhibition of tumor cell migration and invasion and may include (c)
potential anitangiogenic activity mediated through direct effects on
the ability of endothelial cells to form functional vasculature. In
addition, the strong correlation of inhibition of c-Met and c-Met–
dependent phenotypes by PF-2341066 indicates that c-Met
phosphorylation should function as a useful pharmacodynamic
biomarker of inhibition of c-Met–mediated function in tumors. To
this effect, studies relating pharmacodynamics to efficacy indicated
that near-complete inhibition of c-Met phosphorylation (>90%
inhibition) for the duration of the administration schedule is
necessary to maximize antitumor efficacy of PF-2341066. These
data indicate that maintaining a sufficient degree of c-Met
inhibition in patients will be critical in maximizing the therapeutic
potential of this agent, and that a strategy to measure c-Met
phosphorylation in patient tumor biopsies or surrogate tissue is
warranted.
Following the identification of optimal dose levels of PF-2341066,
studies were initiated to determine the sensitivity a variety of
tumor models to this agent. The models selected for these studies
represented different mechanisms by which c-Met has been
reported to be activated in human tumors, including (a) paracrine
activation by HGF expressed in tumor-associated mesenchymal
tissue, (b) autocrine expression of both c-Met and HGF by tumor
cells, and (c) expression of constitutively active c-Met due to
increased expression or amplification of its gene locus. In these
studies, PF-2341066 showed cytoreductive antitumor activity in
models expressing high levels of constitutively activated c-Met,
including GTL-16 gastric or Caki-1 renal carcinoma. These data
indicate that gastric carcinoma patients with amplified c-Met or

Antitumor Mechanism of a c-Met Inhibitor, PF-2341066

renal patients with high levels of constitutively activated c-Met may
comprise clinical populations that exhibit higher probability of
objective response to PF-2341066. This concept is further
supported by chemosensitivity of a panel of gastric cancer cell
lines exhibiting amplified c-Met to a putative selective inhibitor of
c-Met (39) and by increased expression and activation of c-Met in
renal carcinoma cells devoid of functional VHL (40). Similarly,
U87MG glioblastoma or PC-3 prostate carcinoma models in which
tumor cells express both HGF and c-Met each exhibited a robust
response to PF-2341066, supporting the concept that tumor types
that exhibit autocrine production of c-Met and HGF may also be
candidates for clinical studies. In contrast, although a robust
response of the NCI-H441 NSCLC paracrine model to PF-23410666
was observed, other paracrine c-Met–expressing models such as
MDA-MB-231 breast and DLD-1 colon carcinoma did not respond.
These data suggest that response of populations in which wild-type
c-Met is expressed in the absence of the constitutively active RTK
or autocrine HGF may exhibit a heterogeneous response to c-Met–
directed therapy. These data indicate that further study of
molecular determinants sensitivity to c-Met–directed therapy is
warranted. Chemosensitivity studies with selective c-Met inhibitors
across a panel of human tumor cell lines expressing wild-type

c-Met indicate that the response to these agents is heterogeneous
and associated with selected molecular characteristics (4).
In addition to understanding molecular determinants of chemosensitivity, a basic understanding of the mechanism of action of PF2341066 antitumor activity should also support a robust clinical
strategy. As described above, PF-2341066 showed a direct effect on
tumor cell growth and survival end points in vitro and dosedependent inhibition of cell proliferation and induction apoptosis
in tumors in vivo. Therefore, one mechanism of PF-2341066 is likely
mediated via direct effects on tumor cell mitogenesis and apoptosis
in tumor types in which dysregulation of c-Met is implicated in
altered tumor cell growth regulation. In addition, Ki67 and
activated casapase-3 were modulated in models that responded
to PF-2341066 but were unaffected in those that did not (data not
shown), indicating that these end points may represent markers of
antitumor efficacy.
In the present studies, PF-2341066 also showed the ability to
inhibit HGF-stimulated endothelial cell survival and migration, to
inhibit endothelial cell tubulogenesis, and to reduce MVD in the
GTL-16 model. In addition to their reported direct role in
regulating endothelial cell function, c-Met and HGF are also
implicated in the regulation of secretion of angiogenic factors by

epithelial and tumor cells. In the present studies, PF-2341066
showed a robust modulation of VEGF and IL-8 in the GTL-16 and
U87MG tumor models that correlated with its antitumor activity.
Together, these data suggest that antiangiogenic activity observed
with PF-2341066 may be mediated by direct or indirect mechanisms. If the antiangiogenic activity of PF-2341066 is dependent on
the functional expression of c-Met by tumor cells, this will have
implications in terms of the breadth of spectrum of antiangiogenic
activity across tumor types. The absence of evidence of PF-2341066
antiangiogenic activity in the U87MG model and the absence of
efficacy in the MDA-MB-231 and DLD-1 models suggest that the
antiangiogenic activity of this agent is dependent on factors that
are not common to all tumor types. Therefore, although PF2341066 showed antiangiogenic properties in selected assays and
models, it is not evident that this agent will exhibit broad spectrum
antitumor activity through an antiangiogenic activity similar to
VEGF pathway antagonists (41).
In summary, these studies illustrate the pharmacologic effects of
PF-2341066 on a variety of pro-oncogenic tumor cell phenotypes,
tumor models, and molecular mediators of cancer progression. The

broad antitumor efficacy and good safety profile of this molecule
suggest its potential as a novel agent for treatment of a variety of
cancers. The variety of different responses to PF-2341066 observed
in tumor cells and endothelial cells illustrates that this compound
is likely to exert its antitumor effects through multiple distinct
mechanisms. In addition, collective results indicate that the role of
c-Met in the progression of cancers may differ depending on the
cell lineage of origin and genetic context of a given tumor cell. The
diverse role of c-Met in different tumor types as a regulator of
tumor growth, survival, or metastasis will be a critical issue in the
clinical development of c-Met inhibitors, monitoring of patient
response, and design of clinical studies.
