Abstract
Epidermal growth factor (EGF) regulates pituitary development, hormone synthesis, and cell proliferation. Although
ErbB receptor family members are expressed in pituitary
tumors, the effects of EGF signaling on pituitary tumors are
not known. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot confirmed
EGF receptor (EGFR) and p185c-neu protein expression in GH3
lacto-somatotroph but not in adrenocorticotropic hormone–
secreting AtT20 pituitary tumor cells. EGF (5 nmol/L)
selectively enhanced baseline (f4-fold) and serum-induced
(>6-fold) prolactin (PRL) mRNA levels, whereas gefitinib, an
EGFR antagonist, suppressed serum-induced cell proliferation
and Pttg1 expression, blocked PRL gene expression, and
reversed EGF-mediated somatotroph-lactotroph phenotype
switching. Downstream EGFR signaling by ERK, but not
phosphoinositide-3-kinase or protein kinase C, mediated the
gefitinib response. Tumors in athymic mice implanted s.c.
with GH3 cells resulted in weight gain accompanied by
increased serum PRL, growth hormone, and insulin growth
factor 1. Gefitinib decreased tumor volumes and peripheral
hormone levels by f30% and restored normal mouse body
weight patterns. Mice treated with gefitinib exhibited decreased tumor tissue ERK1/2 phosphorylation and downregulated tumor PRL and Pttg1 mRNA abundance. These
results show that EGFR inhibition controls tumor growth
and PRL secretion in experimental lacto-somatotroph tumors.
EGFR inhibitors could therefore be useful for the control
of PRL secretion and tumor load in prolactinomas resistant
to dopaminergic treatment, or for those prolactinomas
undergoing rare malignant transformation. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Pituitary adenomas account for f15% of primary intracranial
neoplasms and are discovered in up to 25% of unselected autopsy
specimens. Despite their benign nature, tumor growth may lead to
critical local compressive symptoms and altered hormone
secretion resulting in distinct endocrine syndromes, depending
on the tumor cell type (1). Pituitary adenomas arise as clonal
expansions of mutated somatic cells, but the sequence of initial
transforming events are unclear and occur on a background of
chromosomal instability, epigenetic alterations, and mutations.

Given the rich vascularization of the gland, and the tight
hypothalamic control of hormone secretion, alterations within
the pituitary microenvironment including paracrine or autocrine
dysregulation and growth factor disruption may be permissive for
accelerated growth (1).
Pituitary tumors arising from the lacto-somatotroph cell lineage,
which secrete growth hormone (GH) and/or prolactin (PRL),
usually respond to medical treatment with dopamine agonists and/
or somatostatin analogues (1–3). Medical therapy may however be
limited due to dopamine or somatostatin receptor resistance (2, 3),
or drug intolerance. For adrenocorticotropic hormone–secreting
and clinically nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas, no effective drug
therapies currently exist (4, 5). The success of trans-sphenoidal
pituitary surgery is highly dependent on the experience and
expertise of the surgeon, and the size and type of tumor.
Radiotherapy, used after failed trans-sphenoidal surgery and/or
medical therapy, is associated with relatively high complication
rates (2–6). Treatment alternatives are particularly required for
recurring invasive macroadenomas and for infrequently encountered but aggressive pituitary carcinomas which respond poorly to
currently available therapies (7, 8).
Aberrant ErbB receptor activation is implicated in several
human cancers, leading to the development of novel targeted
therapeutics, including monoclonal antibodies and small compound tyrosine kinase inhibitors (9). Although ErbB receptors are
expressed in pituitary adenomas (10, 11), and are particularly
abundant in very rarely encountered pituitary carcinomas (12, 13),
the effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR)
signaling on pituitary tumors are unknown. EGFR inhibition in
hormonally inactive pituitary folliculostellate cells resulted in
reduced Pttg expression (14), a marker for pituitary tumor growth
implicated in tumorigenesis and paracrine regulation (15).
Here, we characterize EGFR-mediated pituitary signaling and
report the effects of EGFR blockade on hormonally active pituitary
tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. The results indicate that EGFR
blockade controls experimental pituitary tumor growth and
hormone secretion. EGFR inhibition could therefore serve as a
molecular target for treating patients unresponsive to currently
available forms of medical therapy.

Medicine, Philadelphia, PA). After synchronization by serum starvation
(GH3 cells in medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin for f24 h;
AtT20 in 1% FBS medium for f16 h), cells were plated onto 100 mm dishes
(f1.5  106 cell density) or six-well plates (f0.5  106 cell density),
treatment agents were added with fresh serum-depleted medium (0.2%
bovine serum albumin), and samples collected at the indicated times.
Templates for probes and Northern blot analysis. Probes for murine
POMC, Pttg1, rat GH, and PRL were generated as described (16–18). The
h-actin probe was a 1.076 kb fragment of the mouse b-actin gene (Ambion).
RNA extraction was performed using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. For Northern blot analysis, 10 to 20 Ag of
total RNA was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose, 6.4% formaldehyde gel,
transferred to a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham) and UV cross-linked.
Probes were labeled with (a-32P)CTP using the Prime-It random primer
labeling kit (Stratagene). Micro Bio-Spin chromatography columns (BioRad) were used to purify probes. Membrane prehybridization and
hybridization were performed using QuickHyb Solution (Stratagene) and
then exposed to Hyperfilm MP (Amersham) for 1 to 4 days at 70jC.
Quantitative PCR. Total RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The amount
and the integrity of RNA were assessed by measurement of absorbance at
260 and 280 nm. Before processing, RNA samples were treated with DNase I
(Amplification Grade; Invitrogen) to eliminate genomic DNA contamination. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed into first-strand cDNA using
Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) reactions were
carried out in the iQ5 Multicolor Real-time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Inc.) as previously described (19). Primer sequences
(Invitrogen) for rat vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) forward,
5¶-TCCTGTGTGCCCCTAATG-3¶; reverse, 5¶-TGGCTTTGGTGAGGTTTG-3¶;
rat Pttg1 forward, 5¶-CATAGGTGCTCTGGTCTCTGTTG-3¶; reverse, 5¶GGCATTGAGGAAGGCTGGAAG-3¶. Primer sequences for rat GH, PRL,
and b-actin have been described previously (19).
Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. After the completion of
treatments, the cells were placed on ice and washed with cold PBS. For
whole cell protein extraction, cells were lysed in 150 AL of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Sigma) containing complete protease
inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Lysates were
centrifuged at 13,000  g for 20 min at 4jC and protein concentrations
determined by Bradford’s method (Bio-Rad).
Immunoprecipitation with rabbit polyclonal anti-EGFR (3 Ag, ab2430;
Abcam), polyclonal anti-Neu (C-18, sc-284), and anti-ErbB3 (sc-285, 2 Ag;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was performed with an immunoprecipitation kit
(Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the instructions of the
manufacturer. Cells cultured in 100 mm dishes were lysed in 1 mL of lysis
buffer-1 containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail tablets
(Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Preclearing was performed with agarose G
beads (50 AL) overnight at 4jC. Immunoprecipitation with appropriate
antibody titers was performed for 1 h prior to the addition of agarose G
beads (50 AL) overnight at 4jC. After extensive washes (twice in wash
buffer-1, twice in wash buffer-2, and once in wash buffer-3 for 20 min each),
samples were resuspended in 30 AL of sample buffer (Invitrogen).
Immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibody 7.16.4 (ref. 20; 3 Ag; a
kind gift from Dr. M.I. Greene) which reacts specifically with rat p185
molecules was performed in cells lysed with modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% NaDodSO4,
0.15 mol/L NaCl, 0.01 mol/L sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 2 mmol/L EDTA,
10 mmol/L sodium PPi, 400 Amol/L sodium orthovanadate] containing
complete protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Preclearing was performed with A/G Plus-Agarose beads (20 AL;
Sigma) overnight at 4jC. Immunoprecipitation with appropriate antibody
titers was performed for 1 h prior to the addition of A/G Plus-Agarose beads
(20 AL) overnight at 4jC. Immunoprecipitates were washed six times in
washing buffer and resuspended in SDS sample buffer (pH 6.8) as previously
described (21).
Western blot analysis was performed according to the guidelines of
NuPAGE electrophoresis system protocol (Invitrogen). In brief, whole cell

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (15). August 1, 2008

lysates (f50 Ag protein per lane) or immunoprecipitation samples were
heated for 5 min at 100jC, respectively. Proteins were separated on 4% to
12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gels and electrotransferred for 1 h to polyvinylidene
difluoride (Invitrogen). Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 2% nonfat dry
milk (or 5% bovine serum albumin) in TBS-T buffer, and incubated
overnight with primary antibody. The following primary antibodies were
used: mouse anti-pERK1/2, rabbit anti-ERK1/2 (1:200; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), mouse monoclonal anti-pTyr (PY99), rabbit polyclonal
anti-EGFR (sc-03), anti-Neu, anti-ErbB3 (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
anti-pPDK1 (1:1,000; Cell Signaling), and mouse anti–h-actin (1:1,000;
Sigma). After washing with TBS-T, membranes were incubated with
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1.5 h (2% nonfat dry milk
or 5% bovine serum albumin in TBS-T buffer). Blots were washed and
hybridization signals measured by enhanced chemiluminescence detection
system (Amersham).
Flow cytometric cell cycle analysis. Treatments were added after
synchronization in fresh serum-depleted medium and samples collected at
the indicated times. Cells were washed and fixed in 50% ice-cold ethanol
and cell cycle analysis was performed as previously described (14).
In vivo experiments. Female athymic NCR-NU mice (8–10 weeks of age)
were purchased from Taconic Farms, Inc., and maintained in a laminar airflow unit under aseptic conditions. The research protocol was approved and
the care and treatment of experimental animals were in accordance with
institutional guidelines. Mice were fed with a commercial pelleted diet and
tap water ad libitum, and were allowed to acclimatize for 1 week. For s.c.
injections, rat GH3 cells (1.8  106, 0.2 mL of suspension) were injected in
both flanks of each mouse. When average tumor volumes reached 3 to
5 mm in diameter (day 1), mice were stratified by tumor volume into two
groups of 12 mice (16 tumors per group). Although all 24 mice received twosided injections of GH3 cells, in some cases, tumor growth was not
observed, so the groups were formed to contain equal numbers of mice
harboring one (8 mice per group) or two tumors (4 mice per group). Vehicle
solution (1% Tween 80; 200 AL) versus gefitinib (125 mg/kg) were
administered via oral gavage daily (Monday to Friday) for a total of
14 weekday doses over 18 days. The maximum tolerated dose (150 mg/kg)
of gefitinib in NCR-NU mice has been determined previously (with similar
administration schedules; refs. 22, 23). A group of mice (n = 12) with no
injection of GH3 cells received vehicle solution per oral gavage daily to
establish baseline values. Every 3 to 4 days, mice were weighed and tumor
volumes measured with a caliper and calculated using the formula, p/6 
large diameter  small diameter2. On the last treatment day (day 18), within
f3 h of drug administration, after determination of body weight and tumor
volume, mice were euthanized; cardiac blood collected with 255/8-gauge
syringes (Becton Dickinson) and primary tumors excised and weighed.
Fragments of each tumor were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin
for immunohistochemical staining, preserved in RNAlater solution (Qiagen)
for subsequent RNA extraction and frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent
protein extraction.
Immunofluorescence. Slides containing tissue sections were baked for
20 min at 60jC, washed in xylene, ethanol gradient (100%, 95%, 85%, and
75%), and then double-distilled water. For detection of EGFR expression,
slides were placed into boiling EDTA (1 mmol/L; pH 8) and incubated in a
steamer for 15 min (Black and Decker). Slides were blocked in 5% goat
serum and then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4jC.
The following antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-EGFR (1:50,
ab2430; Abcam), guinea pig polyclonal anti-PRL (1:200; courtesy of Dr. A.F.
Parlow, National Hormone and Peptide Program, Harbor-UCLA Medical
Center, Torrance, CA). Following washes, slides were incubated with Alexa
Fluor goat anti-rabbit 488 (H+L) secondary antibody (1:500; Invitrogen) for
1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained using 1:500 Topro-3 iodide
1 mmol/L solution (1:250 in PBS, Molecular Probes, Inc.) for 15 min at room
temperature, afterwards, slides were mounted with Prolong Gold anti-fade
reagent with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes, Inc). Confocal microscope images were obtained using a TCS-SP confocal scanner
(Leica Microsystems). In order to detect contributions of autofluorescence
in these paraffin-embedded tissues, a spectral imaging approach was
used. The confocal spectrophotometer was set to detect specific FITC

EGFR-Mediated Prolactinoma Cell Regulation

Figure 1. EGFR expression and time-dependent effects of EGF on hormone mRNA expression. A and B, GH3, MMQ, and AtT20 cells were serum-starved overnight
and total protein extracted. A, immunoprecipitation (IP ) was performed with an EGFR antibody (ab2430) and immunoblotting performed with a different EGFR
antibody (sc-03). B, immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed with Neu (C-18) antibody (sc-284). C, GH3 cells were serum-starved for 24 h and
subsequently treated with EGF (5 nmol/L). Total RNA was extracted at the times indicated and GH mRNA expression determined by Northern blot. Subsequently,
membranes were stripped and reblotted with specific probes for PRL and b-actin, respectively. The ratio of GH or PRL mRNA vs. b-actin mRNA was calculated by
densitometric analysis of each treatment group. The GH/b-actin ratio and PRL/b-actin ratio of the control groups at 24 and 48 h were set as 1.0. Relative mRNA
expression levels were normalized to these control groups. C, control; S, serum; columns, mean relative mRNA expression levels; bars, SE (top ). *, P < 0.05;

fluorescence in the range of 505 to 540 nm. A second channel detecting
autofluorescence with wavelengths from 560 to 600 nm was used. Both
channels were color-coded and merged. Green color represents specific
fluorescence from FITC and red color represents autofluorescence. The
staining was strong and autofluorescence was very low in comparison to
the specific signal. Only erythrocytes showed appreciable autofluorescence
and appear dark orange in the images. A Leica PlanApo 20 0.7 N.A. lens
was used for overview images and a PlanApo 40 1.2 N.A. lens was used for
high-magnification images.
Hormone assays. RIA for rat GH and PRL were performed in duplicate,
using reagents provided by the National Hormone and Peptide Program,
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, CA. Iodination of GH and PRL
(5 Ag) with iodine-125 (500 ACi; Perkin-Elmer Life & Analytical Sciences)
mixed with 0.1 mg of Iodo-Gen (Pierce) was performed using 10 mL
columns prepared by G-75 Sephadex (Sigma Chemical, Co.). Low interspecies cross-reactivity of the GH and PRL assays is shown in Fig. 5Bb.
Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) was measured by RIA after acid-alcohol
extraction using a kit specific for rat and mouse IGF-I (Diagnostic System
Laboratories). Thus, in Fig. 5Bb, baseline IGF-I levels are also shown.
Statistical analysis. Cell cycle phases were analyzed by ModFit LT
software (version 2.0, Becton Dickinson). NIH Image 1.59 software was used
for densitometric analysis of specific bands in Northern and Western blots
and comparisons were evaluated using two-tailed Student’s t test. Results
are expressed as mean F SE of independently performed experiments.
Relationships between numerical variables were summarized by Pearson
( for normally distributed variables) or Spearman ( for nonnormally
distributed variables) correlation coefficients. Group differences in serum
GH, PRL, and IGF-I levels and postmortem tumor weights were assessed by
Student’s t test (normally distributed variables) or the Wilcoxon rank sum

test (nonnormally distributed variables). Tumor volumes were transformed
by cube roots for the purpose of linearization. Linear growth models
(intercept and slope) were estimated for changes in tumor volume and
weight across time, using maximum likelihood methods and a mixed
models approach similar to repeated measures ANOVA. The covariance
structure was estimated with an autoregressive model. Analyses were
performed using SAS version 9.1. For all tests, statistical significance was set
at P < 0.05.

Results
EGFR expression and function in pituitary tumor cell lines.
Immunoprecipitation with a specific EGFR antibody (ab2430) and
subsequent immunoblotting (1005) revealed the expression of the
170 kDa EGFR in GH3 cells, whereas expression was not detected
in MMQ and AtT20 pituitary cells (Fig. 1A). Similar to EGFR
expression, immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with Neu
(C-18) antibody (sc-284), which detects ErbB2 and ErbB4, showed
the expression (f185 kDa) of these related kinases in GH3 but not
in MMQ or AtT20 cells (Fig. 1B). Mouse 3T3/A31 and human A431
cell lysate extracts served as positive immunoreactive controls
(Supplemental Fig. S1A).
In lacto-somatotroph GH3 cells, EGF treatment (5 nmol/L)
potently enhanced both baseline and serum-induced PRL mRNA
abundance (Fig. 1C). EGF induced PRL mRNA gene expression by
f4.1-fold (P < 0.05) at 48 hours. Serum alone also induced PRL
expression f3.2-fold, and cotreatment with serum and added EGF

further enhanced this effect to > 6-fold (Fig. 1C). EGF modestly
attenuated GH mRNA expression (Fig. 1C), and the growth factor
did not induce S phase entry (Supplemental Fig. S1B). In contrast
to the observed effects in GH3 cells, EGF treatment for up to 48
hours did not alter AtT20 cell POMC gene expression (data not
shown).
Effect of gefitinib on pituitary tumor cell proliferation and
gene expression. Treatment with increasing concentrations of
gefitinib (0.1–10 Amol/L) dose-dependently attenuated seruminduced S phase entry in GH3 cells (Fig. 2B) and suppressed seruminduced Pttg1 mRNA expression (Fig. 2A). Gefitinib treatment
modestly stimulated baseline and serum-induced GH, and
inhibited PRL mRNA expression (Fig. 2A).
In contrast to GH3 cells, the percentage of AtT20 cells in S phase
as well as serum-induced Pttg1 mRNA expression (>2.5-fold) was
unaffected by increasing concentrations of gefitinib (0.1–10 Amol/L;
data not shown). Gefitinib also did not alter POMC mRNA
expression at 24 and 48 hours in AtT20 cells (data not shown).
The dose-dependent effects of gefitinib on GH3 and AtT20 cell
proliferation are shown in Fig. 3C. Cells were incubated for 4 days
with increasing doses of gefitinib. Doses as low as 0.1 Amol/L led to
a f15% (P < 0.001) attenuation of GH3 cell number, with a dosedependent decrease of f72% (P < 0.001) at 10 Amol/L. AtT20 cell
numbers were not altered at these doses.
The observed EGF-induced lactotroph phenotype in GH3 cells
(Fig. 1C) was reversed by pretreating cells with gefitinib prior to
induction with EGF (Fig. 2D). The dose-dependent effects of
gefitinib on the EGF-mediated lacto-somatotroph phenotype were
evident at concentrations (5–10 Amol/L) which induced GH mRNA

levels, whereas the lowest concentration tested (0.1 Amol/L)
selectively abrogated EGF-induced PRL gene expression.
ErbB family member expression in GH3 cells. Induction of
GH3 cells with EGF (5 nmol/L; Fig. 3Aa) or serum (data not shown)
rapidly (within 5 minutes) induced tyrosine phosphorylation of
several proteins sized >160, f95, f70, and f40 kDa. As shown in
Fig. 3A, proteins sized f170 to 180 kDa were most prominently
phosphorylated, corresponding to the approximate size of EGFR
and related receptor members. EGF, but not serum, also induced
tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins f55 kDa in size, whereas
phosphorylation by serum was more sustained (>2 hours; data not
shown), as compared with the transient EGF effects (5–15 minutes).
The dose-dependency of gefitinib on EGF-induced tyrosine
phosphorylation is shown in Fig. 3Ab.
Activation of ErbB receptor members was confirmed by
immunoprecipitation with receptor-specific antibodies (Fig. 3B).
EGF (5 nmol/L) induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR which
was blocked by gefitinib pretreatment (1 Amol/L; Fig. 3Ba).
B104-1-1 murine fibroblasts transformed by constitutively active
oncogenic rat neu variant p185neu were used as a positive control
for immunoprecipitation with the monoclonal antibody 7.16.4
(Fig. 3Bb). In contrast to B104-1-1 cells, GH3 cell neu tyrosine
phosphorylation was only observed in response to ligand
activation, suggesting that the cells express the proto-oncogenic
cellular homologue p185c-neu (Fig. 3Bb). Potent tyrosine phosphorylation of p185c-neu was observed both in response to EGF (an
EGFR receptor ligand) and HRG (6 nmol/L, an ErbB3/4 ligand;
Fig. 3Bd), indicating p185c-neu as the preferred ErbB family
heterodimerization partner in this cell line. Gefitinib pretreatment

cells were serum-starved for 24 h and pretreated with gefitinib (7.5 Amol/L) and/or U0126 (5 Amol/L), LY294002 (5 Amol/L), or GF109203X (1 Amol/L) for 30 min prior
to induction with serum (15% HS, 2.5% FBS). Twenty-two hours after induction with serum, cells were fixed and cell cycle analysis performed by flow cytometry.

Potent ErbB3 tyrosine phosphorylation was detected in response to
the receptor ligand HRG (Fig. 3Bd), whereas low levels of ErbB3
tyrosine phosphorylation were occasionally detected in response to
EGF (shown in Fig. 3Bd), suggesting modest ligand-induced EGFR/
ErbB3 heterodimer formation.
GH3 cell proliferation signaling pathways. To identify the
signaling pathways involved in GH3 cell proliferation, we blocked
key signaling molecules prior to serum-induced release into the cell
cycle. Inhibitors were screened at concentrations of 10 Amol/L
(data not shown). Blockade of Rho, Src, and JAK tyrosine kinases by
Y-27632, PP2, or JAK inhibitor I did not alter serum-induced cell
proliferation. However, inhibition of MEK, phosphoinositide-3-

www.aacrjournals.org

kinase (PI3K), and protein kinase C (PKC) with U0126, LY294002,
and GF109203X suppressed the number of cells entering S phase.
To analyze the mechanisms for gefitinib-mediated inhibition of
pituitary cell proliferation, the drug was tested together with
specific pathway inhibitors (Fig. 3C). For these experiments,
gefitinib was employed at doses of 7.5 Amol/L and the lowest
active concentrations of U0126, LY294002 (5 Amol/L), and
GF109203X (1 Amol/L) were used as derived from dose-response
experiments (data not shown).

(P < 0.001), respectively (Fig. 3C). Cotreatment with gefitinib and
the aforementioned signaling blockers prior to serum induction
led to further attenuation of cell proliferation. The results of
combined EGFR and ERK or PI3K inhibition were within the
expected additive range of single agent treatments, whereas
greater-than-additive effects were observed for combined EGFR
and PKC signaling blockade.
Effects of gefitinib on EGF and serum-induced ERK and
PDK1 signaling. The time-dependent phosphorylation of EGFR
and subsequent ERK1/2 activation are depicted in Fig. 4. Similar to
results observed in the total phosphotyrosine blots (Fig. 3A), EGFmediated ERK activation seemed to be transient, lasting for up to
60 minutes (Fig. 4A), whereas serum induced a more sustained
effect (up to 4 hours; Fig. 4C), and also modestly stimulated PDK1
phosphorylation (peaking at 5 to 10 minutes; Fig. 4C). Pretreatment
with gefitinib dose-dependently suppressed EGF-induced EGFR

phosphorylation (Fig. 4B) and blocked both EGF and seruminduced ERK phosphorylation with a similar potency (Fig. 4B and
D). EGF did not induce ERK phosphorylation in AtT20 cells (data
not shown), consistent with no detectable EGFR expression
(Fig. 1A) and gefitinib did not alter serum-induced PDK1
phosphorylation (Fig. 4D).
Effects of EGFR blockade on lacto-somatotroph tumor
growth and hormone expression. To evaluate in vivo effects of
gefitinib on lacto-somatotroph tumor growth and hormone
regulation, GH3 cells were implanted subcutaneously into female
athymic NCR-NU mice. In vehicle-treated animals, relative tumor
volume increased progressively, achieving 26-fold change from
baseline at 18 days. In gefitinib-treated animals, relative tumor
volume was attenuated by f50% overall (Fig. 5Aa). Gefitinib
treatment reduced absolute tumor volume from 865 F 94 mm3 to
580 F 110 mm3 versus controls by day 18 (Fig. 5Ab). Tumor volume

weeks of age) with GH3 pituitary tumor cells (1.8  106, 0.2 mL of suspension). When tumor volumes reached 3 to 5 mm in diameter (day 1), animals were stratified
by tumor volume into two groups of 12 mice (16 tumors). Vehicle solution (1% Tween 80; 200 AL) vs. gefitinib (Gf, 125 mg/kg) were administered via oral gavage daily
(Monday to Friday) for a total of 14 weekday doses over 18 treatment days. A group of mice (n = 12) with no injection of GH3 pituitary tumor cells received vehicle

correlated with postmortem tumor weight at day 18 (0.88,
P < 0.001). Analysis of all tumors (n = 31) showed estimated slope
values of 0.33 and 0.25, respectively, i.e., slower growth rate in the
drug-treated group (P < 0.05).
Vehicle-treated animals harboring tumors gained weight (f18%)
as compared with age-matched mice not injected with tumor cells
(slope for mean weight increase per day, 0.27; Fig. 5Ba). Gefitinib
treatment slowed the excessive weight gain, starting at day 8, and
peaking at the end of the experiment (slope value, 0.04; P < 0.001).
Differences in body weight (>4 g) could not be ascribed to differences in tumor weight (f50 mg). Although anorexic effects

of gefitinib cannot be excluded, at maximum tolerated dose
(150 mg/kg) in NCR-NU mice, weight loss does not exceed 10%
(22, 23), and weight loss was not observed compared with vehicletreated animals not harboring tumors. Gefitinib treatment
decreased serum GH, PRL, and IGF-I levels to 74% (not significant),
75% (P = 0.036), and 66% (P = 0.011), respectively (Fig. 5Bb).
Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed both EGFR and PRL
expression in tumor tissue (Figs. 5C and 6B). EGFR immunoreactivity was especially prominent in peripheral areas of the tumor
(Fig. 5Ca and b). Heterogeneous EGFR staining was also observed
in tumor cells within the solid core area (Fig. 5Ca and c), whereas

(Fig. 5Cd), serving as an internal negative control.
Tumor protein and RNA samples were paired in vehicle and
gefitinib-treated animals according to tumor volumes. Western blot
of tumor protein samples revealed f23% (P < 0.05) decreased
tumor ERK1/2 phosphorylation from gefitinib-treated animals
(n = 16; Fig. 6Aa and b). Q-PCR also showed decreased PRL mRNA
levels in four of six tumors, and decreased Pttg1 mRNA expression
in five of six volume-matched paired tumor samples. Overall,
intratumoral PRL and Pttg1 gene expression decreased by 35% (not
significant) and 37% (P < 0.05), respectively (Fig. 6Ac). These results
were confirmed by Northern blots of paired tumor extracts with

sufficient RNA available (Fig. 6Ad). Intratumoral GH and VEGF-A
mRNA levels assessed by Q-PCR (Fig. 6Ac) were not altered by
treatment. In contrast, PRL immunoreactivity was suppressed in
tumor cells after drug treatment (Fig. 6B).

Discussion
EGFR expression has been detected in normal anterior pituitary
hormone-secreting cells (24), and EGF induces cell proliferation
of nontumorous pituitary cells (25, 26). EGF induces lactotroph
differentiation (27, 28), and targeted expression of a dominant
negative EGFR in transgenic mice blocks both somatotroph and

lactotroph development (29). Pituitary TGFa, an EGFR ligand, is
up-regulated prior to the development of estrogen-mediated
lactotroph hyperplasia in rats (30), and lactotroph TGFa overexpression in transgenic mice results in hyperplasia and adenoma
formation (31), suggesting a role for EGFR in lactotroph
tumorigenesis. Varying levels of EGFR binding have been reported
in human pituitary tumors (10, 32–34), particularly in invasive
adenomas (34) or carcinomas (13).
Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting confirmed that
EGFR protein is expressed in lacto-somatotroph GH3 cells (35).
As neither MMQ or AtT20 corticotroph cells express EGFR family
members (Fig. 1A and B), the nonresponsiveness of these cell lines
to the tested ligands and drugs was not surprising. In contrast, our
results confirmed EGF-mediated induction of the lactotroph
phenotype in GH3 cells, with marked induction of PRL transcription. The specificity of EGFR signaling was shown by suppression of
EGF-mediated PRL induction by gefitinib (as low as 0.1 Amol/L).
EGFR inhibition with gefitinib also reversed serum-induced
lactotroph differentiation and cell proliferation, indicating a role
for EGFR signaling in the mitogenic response. These results
suggested that additional serum factors may lead to EGFR
activation, which in turn, is required for PRL gene transcription
and induction of cell proliferation.
ErbB (HER) family receptor overexpression, ligand binding, or
oncogenic mutations lead to homodimerization or heterodimerization and subsequent induction of kinase activity. Several EGFR,
ErbB3, and ErbB4 ligands have been identified, and ErbB2 is the
preferred dimerization partner. The specific pattern of dimer
formation determines the specificity of downstream signaling ( for
review see ref. 9). Monoclonal antibodies directed against
extracellular domains of ErbB receptors as well as small molecule
tyrosine kinase inhibitors allow targeted inhibition of tumor ErbB
receptor signaling (9).
As ErbB receptors are expressed in rat GH3 cells (Fig. 1A and B),
we examined mechanisms for ErbB family expression and
activation. The rat neu oncogene encodes p185neu with intrinsic
tyrosine kinase activity, which differs from its cellular homologue
p185c-neu by a single transmembrane amino acid substitution (Val664 ! Glu), resulting in constitutive activity of the intrinsic kinase
(36). With the use of the monoclonal antibody 7.16.4, which reacts
specifically with rat p185 molecules, we observed tyrosine
phosphorylation of the precipitated receptor only after ligand
induction, suggesting the expression of proto-oncogenic cellular
p185c-neu in GH3 cells, compared with oncogenic and constitutively
active p185neu expression in B104-1-1 controls (Fig. 3B). Gefitinib
prevented EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR and
p185c-neu. In addition to the activation of ErbB3, induction with the
ErbB3 ligand heregulin also activated p185c-neu, indicating that
p185c-neu was the preferred dimerization partner in GH3 cells.
However, the occasional detection of low-level ErbB3 tyrosine
phosphorylation in response to EGF (an EGFR ligand) also suggests
the potential of EGFR/ErbB3 heterodimer formation in GH3 cells.
EGFR signaling involves diverse cell-specific intracellular pathways and patterns of dimer formation (9), and we show that
EGFR-related pathways activated by serum-induced GH3 cell
proliferation include ERK, PI3K, and PKC. Combined treatment
with gefitinib and the PKC inhibitor GF109203X resulted in marked
induction of the G0-1 phase (Fig. 3C), suggesting that the
antiproliferative effects of EGFR and PKC inhibition are mediated
by blockade of different signaling molecules. However, given the
heterogeneity of PKC signaling (37), and the broad PKC isoform

www.aacrjournals.org

blockade achieved, specific involvement of particular PKC isoforms
or novel isoform members cannot be excluded, as described
for EGF-mediated regulation of the PRL promoter in GH4/GH4C1
cells (38).
As the results of combined EGFR and ERK or PI3K inhibition
were within the expected additive range of monotherapies
(Fig. 3C), we examined the direct effects of EGF and serum on
EGFR/ERK and PDK1 (which mediates PI3K-dependent Akt
phosphorylation; ref. 39) activation. Both EGF and serum induced
rapid ERK phosphorylation, whereas serum activated PDK1, with
sustained ERK activation, similar to patterns observed for tyrosine
phosphorylation. Thus, transient EGFR-mediated ERK activation
may be sufficient for the induction of PRL gene expression;
however, sustained ERK phosphorylation and associated nuclear
accumulation (40–42) as well as stimulation of other signaling
pathways such as PI3K are necessary for serum induction of
pituitary cell mitogenesis. The duration and strength of ERK
activation elicits different cellular growth responses, i.e., proliferation versus differentiation (43). Concentrations of gefitinib as
low as 0.1 Amol/L effectively suppressed EGFR and ERK phosphorylation, but not PDK1. Thus, the results shown here suggest
that the blockade of EGFR/ERK, and not PI3K signaling, mediate
gefitinib inhibition of GH3 cell proliferation.
Injection of nude mice with GH3 cells resulted in the formation
of large tumors and increased circulating serum PRL, GH, and
IGF-I levels. Vehicle-treated animals harboring tumors showed
increased weight gain during the course of the experiment, likely
due to excessive GH and IGF-I levels. Treatment with gefitinib
decreased tumor volume, serum hormone levels, and an attenuated
weight curve comparable to that of non–tumor-bearing controls.
In vivo antiproliferative activity of gefitinib was evidenced by
lowered slope values for mean tumor volume increase in treated
animals, and reduced Pttg mRNA expression in ex vivo tumor
tissue. The failure of EGFR inhibition to completely block the
growth of already established tumors can be ascribed to doserelated tumor drug penetration, heterogeneity of EGFR expression,
and possible receptor down-regulation in central tumor areas with
high cell density, as shown in Fig. 5C. Similar to the in vitro results,
ex vivo analysis showed down-regulation of PRL but not GH mRNA
expression. Thus, reduced peripheral tumor GH/IGF-I levels were
likely the result of tumor load reduction, whereas serum PRL
reduction likely occurred consequent to intratumor PRL gene and
protein suppression. In vivo involvement of EGFR/ERK signaling
was confirmed by demonstrating the reduction of ERK activity in
treated tumor samples.
The results shown here suggest that EGFR inhibition could be
useful for treating a subset of aggressive pituitary tumors with
established EGFR expression, even if expression levels are relatively
low, as EGFR expression levels do not necessarily predict gefitinib
sensitivity (22, 44, 45). The results highlight the potential for
screening postoperative pituitary tumor specimens for ErbB family
expression. Inhibition of EGFR homodimerization and/or heterodimerization may block direct mitogenic signals by ErbB ligands
or inhibit ErbB receptor transactivation by other stimuli (46, 47)
required for induction of cell proliferation. In addition to the
beneficial effects of tumor load reduction, potent inhibition of
EGFR-mediated PRL gene expression could abrogate dramatic
PRL elevations seen in patients with malignant prolactinomas.
These infrequent neoplasms usually exhibit a slowly progressive
malignant phenotype with metastasis, whereas resisting most
forms of conventional therapy including dopamine agonists,

alkylating compound temozolomide (48, 49), or new generation
PRL receptor antagonists (50), targeted EGFR inhibition could
represent an alternative treatment for patients with EGFRexpressing malignant prolactinomas.
