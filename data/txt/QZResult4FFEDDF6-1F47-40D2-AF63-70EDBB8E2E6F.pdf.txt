ABSTRACT
Apo2 ligand/tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (Apo2L/
TRAIL) is a promising anticancer drug due to its tumor-selective cytotoxicity. Here we
report that TRAIL exhibits distinct effects on the mitochondrial networks in malignant
cells and normal cells. Live-cell imaging revealed that multiple human cancer cell
lines and normal cells exhibited two different modes of mitochondrial responses
in response to TRAIL and death receptor agonists. Mitochondria within tumor cells
became fragmented into punctate and clustered in response to toxic stimuli. The
mitochondrial fragmentation was observed at 4 h, then became more pronounced
over time, and associated with apoptotic cell death. In contrast, mitochondria within
normal cells such as melanocytes and fibroblasts became only modestly truncated,
even when they were treated with toxic stimuli. Although TRAIL activated dynaminrelated protein 1 (Drp1)-dependent mitochondrial fission, inhibition of this process
by Drp1 knockdown or with the Drp1 inhibitor mdivi-1, potentiated TRAIL-induced
apoptosis, mitochondrial fragmentation, and clustering. Moreover, mitochondrial
reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated depolarization accelerated mitochondrial
network abnormalities in tumor cells, but not in normal cells, and TRAIL caused
higher levels of mitochondrial ROS accumulation and depolarization in malignant
cells than in normal cells. Our findings suggest that tumor cells are more prone than
normal cells to oxidative stress and depolarization, thereby being more vulnerable
to mitochondrial network abnormalities and that this vulnerability may be relevant
to the tumor-targeting killing by TRAIL.

INTRODUCTION

pathways [5, 6]. However, multiple cancer cell types such
as malignant melanoma, glioma, and non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) cells are resistant to TRAIL treatment
despite expressing DRs on their cell surface. Moreover,
TRAIL-responsive tumors acquire a resistant phenotype
that renders TRAIL therapy ineffective [7, 8]. Therefore,
overcoming TRAIL resistance is necessary for effective
TRAIL therapy, and small molecules that can potentiate
TRAIL effectiveness are urgently required.
Persistent depolarization of the plasma membrane

Apo2 ligand/tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosisinducing ligand (Apo2L/TRAIL) is a member of the tumor
necrosis factor cytokine superfamily, which has emerged
as a promising anticancer drug, because it induces
apoptosis in cancer cells with minimal cytotoxicity toward
normal cells [1-4]. TRAIL binds to two death receptors
(DRs), TRAIL receptor (TRAIL-R)1/DR4 and TRAIL-R2/
DR5 to trigger the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic

potential is an early event essential for apoptosis and
caspase-3 activation in human malignant cells that is
induced by diverse pro-apoptotic agents including antiFas antibody, arsenic trioxide, and the mitochondrial toxin
rotenone [9-11]. We previously showed that depolarization
is an early and prerequisite event during TRAIL-induced
apoptosis in malignant tumor cells such as melanoma,
leukemia, and NSCLC. TRAIL dose- and timedependently induces robust depolarization in these cells
after a time lag of 2−4 h [12, 13]. Moreover, persistent
depolarization induced by high K+ loading or ATPsensitive K+ channel inhibitors sensitizes melanoma cells.
This sensitization is associated with increased intrinsic
and endoplasmic reticulum death pathways. A number
of pro-apoptotic responses, including mitochondrial
reactive oxygen species (mROS) generation, collapse of
mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and oxidation
of cardiolipin within mitochondria are potentiated.
All of these events are known to cooperatively lead to
mitochondrial membrane integrity disruption, a gate
keeping player to the release of pro-apoptotic proteins
such as cytochrome c. In contrast, TRAIL and membranedepolarizing agents alone or in combination minimally
induce apoptosis in normal melanocytes, though the
cells express DR4 and DR5 on their surfaces. These
observations suggest that malignant cells are more prone
than normal cells to the depolarization-triggered apoptosis.
However, the precise mechanisms by which depolarization
potentiates mitochondrial dysfunction remain unclear.
Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles with a
reticular network that is regulated by the balance between
fission and fusion. Mitochondrial morphology is critical
for cell function and apoptosis [14, 15]. The mitochondrial
network depends on the delicate balance between two
antagonistic machineries responsible for fission and fusion
of the mitochondrial membrane. Mitochondrial network
dynamics is controlled by dynamin-related proteins with
GTPase activity, namely mitofusin 1/2 (Mfn1/2), optic
atrophy 1 (OPA1), and dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1).
Mfn1/2, and OPA1 act in concert to regulate mitochondrial
fusion and cristae organization, while Drp1 regulates
mitochondrial fission [16, 17]. A well-balanced fission
and fusion is required for healthy mitochondria, because
either process is essential for cell function and survival.
However, the role of the mitochondrial network in cancer
cell apoptosis is a matter of debate, because controversial
results have been reported about the role of mitochondrial
fission. Mitochondrial fission is thought to be essential
for mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and
cytochrome c release [18]. However, an increasing body
of evidence suggests that mitochondrial fission is proapoptotic or anti-apoptotic, depending on the cell type and
the applied apoptotic stimuli [19—24].
In an attempt to elucidate the role of mitochondrial
fission in cancer cell apoptosis, we previously studied
the effect of enforced mitochondrial fusion due to Drp1

inhibition, on TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Both Drp1
knockdown and the Drp1 inhibitor, mitochondrial division
inhibitor-1 (mdivi-1) [25], inhibits mitochondrial fission,
and kills and sensitizes cancer cells to the apoptosis [26].
These effects are generally observed among different
cancer cell lines. Moreover, the sensitization is associated
with increased intrinsic pathway activity and is preceded
by depolarization, MMP collapse, mROS generation, and
cardiolipin oxidation. In contrast, mdivi-1 and TRAIL,
alone or in combination induced minimal apoptosis in
normal melanocytes and fibroblasts. These observations
suggest that mitochondrial fission acts as an anti-apoptotic
factor in a tumor-specific manner. These findings led us to
investigate the possible role of the mitochondrial network
in TRAIL-induced cancer cell apoptosis. Here we report,
for the first time, that TRAIL induces pro-apoptotic
mitochondrial network abnormalities in human malignant
cells, but not in normal cells. We also demonstrated that
this difference is attributed to the distinct sensitivities of
these cells to ROS and depolarization, which are required
for the pro-apoptotic mitochondrial network abnormalities.

RESULTS
TRAIL induces punctate mitochondria and
their clustering in human cancer cells, but not in
normal cells
As reported earlier [12], TRAIL dose-dependently
increased apoptotic cell death in A375 melanoma cells.
Until 24 h, treatment with up to 100 ng/ml of TRAIL
induced a moderate (<30%) increase in the number
of annexin V-positive cells. On the other hand, 72 h of
treatment with 25 ng/ml of TRAIL caused a modest
increase in the number of annexin V-positive cells
(18.2 ± 0.7 %, n = 4) while treatment with 100 ng/ml
of TRAIL substantially increased the cell population
(59.8 ± 2.9 %, n = 4). Therefore, we used 25 ng/ml and
100 ng/ml TRAIL, respectively as a weak and strong
inducer of apoptosis throughout the present study. Then,
we determined whether TRAIL affected mitochondrial
network dynamics in these cells. The cells were treated
with recombinant human TRAIL for various time periods,
stained with the mitochondria-targeting dye MitoTracker
Red CMXRos, and then their mitochondrial network
were analyzed using a cell imaging system equipped
with digital inverted microscope. In control cells, the
mitochondria mainly consisted of a tubular morphology
of ~ 12 μm, a hallmark of well-balanced fission and
fusion (Figure 1A, left). TRAIL treated cells showed
multiple mitochondrial network abnormalities in a doseand time-dependent manner. After 24 h of treatment with
TRAIL (25 ng/ml), a modest mitochondrial truncation
took place (Figure 1A, middle), resulting in short

mitochondria of the average length of ~9 μm (Figure 1C).
Upon stimulation with a higher concentration of TRAIL
(100 ng/ml), substantial mitochondrial fragmentation
occurred (Figure 1A, right), resulting in extremely short
mitochondria of the average length of ~ 3 μm (Figure
1C). The majority of the mitochondria became punctate
and clustered. Time course experiments indicated that for
TRAIL (100 ng/ml), a modest truncation was observed as
rapidly as 30 min, while punctate mitochondria and their
clustering were first detected at 4 h and then became more
pronounced over time (Figure 1B). Next, we examined
whether this phenomenon is specific for melanoma cells

or generally observed among multiple cancer cell types.
The mitochondria within A549 NSCLC cells exhibited
moderately fragmented network even in the absence of
stimulus (Figure 2A, top left). After TRAIL treatment,
clustering of punctate mitochondria became clear (Figure
2A, top right). Similarly, the mitochondria within two
osteosarcoma cell lines MG63 and HOS also became
fragmented into punctate and clustered after TRAIL
treatment (Figure 2A, middle and bottom). These results
show that TRAIL induces similar mitochondrial network
abnormalities in different human cancer cell types. Then,
we examined whether these mitochondrial network

were plated on a chambered coverglass and treated with soluble recombinant human TRAIL (25, 100 ng/ml) for 24 h A. or TRAIL (100

for mitochondrial network. For each sample, pictures of three different visual fields (totally ~ 40 cells in a single sample) were randomly

abnormalities are specific for tumor cells. As shown in
Figure 2B, TRAIL treatment resulted in modest fission,

and fibroblasts. These results indicate that TRAIL evokes

manner.

network abnormalities and cell death, we compared
the effects of two different anti-DR4/5 antibodies with
different pro-apoptotic activities on mitochondrial
network. An anti-DR5 antibody (αDR5; MAB631 1 μg/
ml) was equipotent to TRAIL (100 ng/ml) at inducing
apoptotic cell death, while an anti-DR4 antibody
(αDR4; MAB631) was ineffective [27] (see Figure 5C).
Treatment with αDR4 resulted in modest fragmentation
of mitochondria in A375 cells (Figure 3A, middle), while
treatment with αDR5 resulted in considerable increases
in punctate and clustered mitochondria (Figure 3A,
bottom). Similar distinct effects of αDR4 and αDR5 on
mitochondrial morphology were observed in A2058
cells (Figure 3C). These observations were confirmed
by mitochondrial length measurements (Figure 3B, 3D)
as well as confocal imaging (Figure 3E). These cells

The mitochondrial network abnormalities are
associated with cell death
Microscopic analyses showed that healthy cells
possess tubular, elongated, or modestly fragmented
mitochondria, while morphologically damaged cells
regularly harbor punctate and clustered mitochondria.

abnormalities by using melanoma cells and melanocytes
as representatives of malignant cells and their normal
counterpart, respectively. Then, we examined the effect
of TRAIL on phosphorylation of Drp1 at Ser616, since
this event is essential for mitochondrial fission [16].
Immunoblot analyses using an antibody directed against
Drp1 phosphorylated at Ser616 (pDrp1 Ser616) indicated
that TRAIL treatment increased the level of pDrp1 Ser616.
Figure 4A shows the representative blots using A375
cells. The level of pDrp1 Ser616 clearly first increased
at 2 h, and thereafter keeping the level for at least 4 h
(Figure 4A, top). On the other hand, the level of pDrp1
at Ser637, which inhibits mitochondrial fission [16], was

basic responses to TRAIL, we investigated the precise
mechanisms that cause the mitochondrial network

first observed at 30 min, reaching the maximum at 1 h, and
thereafter declining (Figure 4A, middle). We also checked
the possible changes in the expression levels of Drp1,
Fis1, and Mfn1 and found that their expression levels were
marginally changed (Figure 4B). To determine whether
the pro-apoptotic mitochondrial network abnormalities
were attributed to the Drp1 pathway, we analyzed
the effect of TRAIL on the mitochondrial network in
A375 cells in which Drp1 protein levels were downregulated by siRNA interference as previously reported
[26]. Compared to control cells treated with irrelevant
scrambled siRNA, cells treated with siRNA targeting Drp1
exhibited significantly elongated mitochondrial network,
indicating that mitochondrial fission is impaired in these
cells (Figure 4C, lower left and 4D). Nevertheless, the
Drp1 knockdown significantly enhanced TRAIL-induced
mitochondrial fragmentation and clustering (Figure 4C,
lower right). As a result, the average mitochondrial length
became significantly shorter than that observed in control
cells treated with TRAIL (Figure 4D). To verify these
observations, we also examined the effect of mdivi-1, a
potent Drp1 inhibitor, which can inhibit mitochondrial
fission in multiple human cancer cell types and sensitizes
them to TRAIL-induced apoptosis [26]. Mdivi-1 treatment
elongated mitochondria in some cells while it promoted
modest mitochondrial fragmentation in others. Totally,
no significant increase in the average mitochondrial
length was observed compared to non-treated control
cells (Figure 4E, lower left, 4F). However, similar
to Drp1 knockdown, Mdivi-1 treatment significantly
accelerated TRAIL-induced mitochondrial fragmentation
and clustering (Figure 4E, lower right), resulting in
mitochondria with the average length of ~ 2 μm (Figure
4F). Collectively, these results show that although
TRAIL induces Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission,
this process inhibits rather than mediates mitochondrial
network abnormalities.

MMPhigh CASP-3high cells. In control cells, the majority
of the cell population (77.3 ± 1.1%) was MMPhigh CASP3low, and other minor populations were MMPlow CASP3low (17.6 ± 1.4%), MMPhigh CASP-3high (3.5 ± 0.6%), or
MMPlow CASP-3high cells (1.7 ± 0.5%) (N = 4), indicating
that MMP is intact and there is minimal caspase-3
activation (Figure 5B). Treatment with TRAIL resulted
in a significant increase in MMPlow CASP-3low cells up
to 42.2 ± 3.9%, concomitant with a significant decrease
in MMPhigh CASP-3low cells down to 42.3 ± 1.6%. In
addition, MMPlow CASP-3high and MMPhigh CASP-3high
cells were increased up to 9.0 ± 3.0% and 6.5 ± 2.2%,
respectively. This indicates that TRAIL induces significant
MMP collapse and caspase-3 activation. Treatment with
αDR5 induced similar effects, while the αDR4 caused only
modest MMP depolarization and minimal caspase-3/7
activation. Moreover, TRAIL and αDR5 were similarly
able to induce apoptosis, while αDR4 minimally induced
apoptosis (Figure 5C, 5D). Although KCl and mdivi-1
alone had minimal effects, these two drugs significantly
potentiated the pro-apoptotic effects of TRAIL and
αDR5. They also significantly augmented αDR4-induced
apoptosis to levels comparable to that induced by TRAIL
and αDR5 alone. These results show the correlation among
depolarization, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis.

Depolarization potentiates the αDR4-induced
mitochondrial network abnormalities
Next, we examined whether depolarization affects
the effects of αDR4 on the mitochondrial network. Figure
6A shows the representative confocal pictures in A2058
cells. Upon high K+ loading, some mitochondria became
elongated while other became moderately fragmented,
as observed after αDR4 treatment. However, when KCl
and αDR4 were applied together, mitochondria primarily
became punctate and clustered (Figure 6A). Moreover,
these mitochondria harbored damaged or fragmented
nuclei. Similar to KCl, mdivi-1 also potentiated αDR4induced mitochondrial network abnormalities (Figure
6A). Judging from the mitochondrial morphology and
the average mitochondrial length, Mdivi-1 and KCl
potentiated the αDR4–induced mitochondrial network
abnormalities to a similar extent (Figure 6B and 6C).
Similar results were obtained with A375 cells (data not
shown).

Correlation among depolarization, mitochondrial
dysfunction, and apoptosis
Considering that depolarization is a key proapoptotic event in TRAIL-induced apoptosis [12, 13], we
hypothesized that it might play a role in the mitochondrial
network abnormalities. To test this possibility, first we
analyzed the capacity of the αDR4 and the αDR5 to evoke
depolarization. As shown in Figure 5A, flow cytometric
analyses using the anionic dye bis-oxonol showed that
TRAIL and αDR5 dose-dependently and significantly
induced depolarization, while αDR4 only modestly
induced depolarization. Next, we analyzed the collapse
of MMP and caspase-3 activation, two key events in
the intrinsic pathway by flow cytometry. Based on their
staining, cells were divided into four groups, MMPlow
CASP-3low, MMPlow CASP-3high, MMPhigh CASP-3low, or

Normal cells are resistant to DR-mediated
depolarization, mROS accumulation, and
mitochondrial network abnormalities
Our earlier studies show that depolarization and
mROS mutually regulate one another during TRAILinduced apoptosis [13, 28]. Therefore, we determined
whether the TRAIL-induced depolarization in melanoma

cells was also ROS-dependent. Treatment with MnTBaP,
a superoxide dismutase-mimetic at concentrations ranging
from 3 to 30 μM dose-dependently reduced TRAILinduced depolarization in A375 cells, although the effects

of MnTBaP were usually more pronounced for TRAIL
(25 ng/ml) than for TRAIL (100 ng/ml) (Figure 7A). As
a result, MnTBaP (30 μM) inhibited the depolarization
induced by TRAIL (25 ng/ml) by 61.1 ± 3.7% (N = 3).

On the other hand, depolarization induced by high K+
loading was minimally affected by MnTBaP treatment
(Figure 7A). These results show that TRAIL specifically
induces depolarization in a ROS-dependent manner in
these cells. Next, we analyzed the ability of TRAIL to
induce depolarization in melanocytes in which TRAIL
induces minimal pro-apoptotic mitochondrial network
abnormalities. TRAIL, αDR5 and αDR4 all induced
minimal depolarization in melanocytes, while high K+
loading caused substantial depolarization comparable
to that observed in A375 cells (Figure 7B), indicating
that melanocytes are specifically resistant to TRAILinduced depolarization. Since mROS appears to regulate
depolarization, we next compared mROS generation
between these two cell types using MitoSOX Red. This
dye localizes to mitochondria and serves as a fluoroprobe
for selective detection of superoxide in these organelles
[29, 30]. Consistent with our earlier study [28], TRAIL
treatment substantially increased mROS levels in A375
cells (Figure 7C). αDR5 also dose-dependently increased
mROS levels while αDR4 had minimal effect. In contrast,
all of these agents only modestly increased mROS levels
in melanocytes. We also found that unlike tumor cells,
minimal punctate mitochondria and their clustering were
observed in normal cells even when αDR4 was applied
together with KCl or Mdivi-1 (Figure 7D). Collectively,
these findings suggest that normal cells are more resistant
than tumor cells to DR-mediated depolarization, mROS
accumulation, and mitochondrial network abnormalities.

(Figure 3A, 3B). Previous studies have shown that
mitochondrial clustering precedes cytochrome c release
during etoposide-, anti-Fas- or arsenic trioxide-induced
apoptosis in leukemia cells [31, 32]. The authors also have
shown that mitochondrial clustering occurs upstream of
caspase-3 activation, and is specifically associated with
intrinsic death pathway, suggesting the pro-apoptotic role.
Hyperfusion of mitochondria caused by fission inhibition
is observed in different cancerous cells and in normal cells
upon stimulation with diverse stimuli. Tondera et al. [33]
have shown that in several cell types including mouse
embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), mitochondria hyperfuse
to form highly-interconnected networks in response to
a number of apoptotic stimuli such as UV irradiation,
actinomycin D and cycloheximide. This stress-induced
mitochondrial hyperfusion (SIMH) requires OPA1, MFN1
and the mitochondrial inner membrane protein, stomatinlike protein 2 (SLP-2), and is adaptive to metabolic
insults. SIMH is a pro-survival response against stressinduced apoptosis, as evidenced by the higher sensitivity
of cells deficient in MFN1 or SLP-2 to actinomycin D
and UV irradiation. Moreover, enforced mitochondrial
hyperfusion, due to the expression of dominant-negative
mutant of Drp1 or membrane-associated ring finger 5,
promotes NF-B activation, and the expression of antiapoptotic genes such as Bcl-XL, X-linked inhibitor of
apoptosis protein, and FLICE-inhibitory protein, in
human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293), HeLa cells, and
MEFs [34]. On the other hand, mitochondrial hyperfusion
induced by knockdown of Drp1 or mitochondrial fission
factor, delays cell cycle progression and promotes
G2/M accumulation and caspase-dependent cell death
in U2OS osteosarcoma cells [35]. These observations
suggest that mitochondrial hyperfusion is pro-apoptotic.
Thus, at present the role of mitochondrial hyperfusion
in cancer cell apoptosis is controversial. Consistent with
our previous study [26], Drp1 knockdown and mdivi-1
treatment increased elongated mitochondria in tumor
cells (Figure 4C-4E). However, unlike Drp1 knockdown,
we also observed modest mitochondrial fragmentation
in some mdivi-1 treated cells (Figures 4E, 6A). Totally,
we observed no significant increase in the average
mitochondrial length (Figure 4F). Similar dual effects
were observed in KCl treated cells (Figure 6A). In our
systems, mitochondrial network abnormalities occurred
sequentially; mitochondrial truncation associated with
local mitochondrial elongation was first observed at
early time points (30 min) after TRAIL treatment while
mitochondrial fragmentation and clustering regularly
became prominent only at late time points (4-24 h)
(Figure 1B). Moreover, while αDR4 or KCl alone
induced mitochondrial truncation and local mitochondrial
elongation, their combined application caused
substantial mitochondrial fragmentation and clustering.
This suggests that the two modes of mitochondrial
network abnormalities are not independent events but

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we show that TRAIL exerts
distinct effects on the mitochondrial networks in
malignant cells and normal cells. TRAIL induced heavy
fragmentation of mitochondria into punctate and their
clustering in multiple human cancer cell lines (Figures
1, 2A) and predominantly caused moderate fission
in normal cells such as melanocytes and fibroblasts
(Figure 2B). Analyses using agonistic αDR4 and αDR5
antibodies indicated that these effects are attributed to
DR ligation (Figure 3A, 3B). Considering that TRAIL
induced apoptosis in cancer cells, but not in normal
cells, it is possible that moderate fission is adaptive while
mitochondrial fragmentation and clustering are proapoptotic. Consistent with this view, the clustering of
punctate mitochondria was specifically associated with cell
damage as well as nuclear fragmentation and chromatin
condensation, the hallmarks of apoptosis (Figures 3E,
6A). Moreover, it is likely that the punctate mitochondria
results from mitochondrial swelling, a consequence of
mitochondrial dysfunction and integrity collapse. In
addition, the observation that αDR4 lacking the proapoptotic activity (Figure 5C, 5D) induced moderate

Figure 8: A hypothetical model for the tumor-selective mitochondrial network abnormalities induced by TRAIL. In

response to DR agonists such as TRAIL, tubular mitochondria in normal cells undergo Drp1-dependent fission and then fuse to restore the
tubular network (upper panel). This may make normal cells resistant to the stress. On the other hand, in tumor cells, relatively higher levels
of mitochondrial ROS (mROS) accumulation occur and then mROS evoke depolarization, which promotes mitochondrial fragmentation
and clustering. Consequently, a smaller number of mitochondria can restore the tubular network through the fission-fusion homeostasis
described above. Hence, this mitochondrial morphology homeostasis can be anti-apoptotic by counteracting pro-apoptotic (irreversible)
mitochondrial network abnormalities, impairment of the Drp1-dependent fission by Drp1 knockdown or mdivi-1 accelerates mitochondrial
fragmentation and clustering, and cell death. mROS accumulation also causes mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) collapse, resulting
in the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), mitochondrial swelling and collapse of mitochondrial integrity, a
central gatekeeper of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Mitochondrial swelling and depolarization may cooperatively facilitate the formation
and clustering of damaged punctate mitochondria. Either or both of mitochondrial fragmentation and clustering may promote apoptotic
cell death.

possibly are related. Collectively, it is possible that the
dual response is either pro-survival or pro-apoptotic
depending on its duration time or amplitude. Interestingly,
mitochondrial hyperfusion like SIMH, may inherently
be an adaptive, pro-survival response, which may be
restored thereafter while mitochondrial hyperfusion may
act as a pro-apoptotic response when it lasts persistently,
as reported by Westrate et al [35]. Consistent with the
impact on mitochondrial network, TRAIL induced the
phosphorylation of Drp1 at Ser616 or Ser637. Moreover,
the duration time for which the phosphorylated proteins
persisted was often different; pDrp1 Ser616 lasted
for at least 4 h while pDrp1 Ser637 declined within
2 h (Figure 4A). Since pDrp1 Ser616 is essential for
mitochondrial fission while pDrp1 Ser637 inhibits it [16],
this may provide a bias toward mitochondrial fission over
mitochondrial fusion. In fact, mitochondrial fragmentation
and clustering progressed at late timing after TRAIL
treatment. Given that mitochondrial hyperfusion results
from mitochondrial fission inhibition, it might play a role
in TRAIL-induced cell death, although we can observe
only local mitochondrial elongation in some cells. Further
investigation is necessary to determine this view.
Since mitochondrial fragmentation and clustering
were accelerated rather than inhibited by Drp1 knockdown
and by mdivi-1 treatment, Drp1-dependent mitochondrial
fission may counteract the pro-apoptotic mitochondrial
network abnormalities. This is also in accordance with
our earlier observations that these two interventions
potentiate TRAIL-induced mitochondrial dysfunctions
and apoptosis [26]. Collectively, these observations
suggest that the mitochondrial fragmentation observed
here may be different from the reversible Drp1-dependent
mitochondrial fission and may be irreversibly committed
to mitochondrial dysfunction.
It is noted that mitochondrial fragmentation can
occur in a Drp1-independent manner. Dimmer and
colleagues have recently shown that down-regulation
of LETM1, an inner mitochondrial membrane protein,
leads to Drp1-independent fragmentation and clustering
of mitochondria and cell death [36]. This event is
not caused by an imbalance in the fission-fusion
equilibrium but is related to ion homeostasis disruption,
since LETM1 functions as K+/H+ antiporter. This is
interesting when considering that TRAIL-induced
mitochondrial fragmentation and clustering is augmented
by depolarization, a major cause of ion homeostasis
disruption and associated with cell death. Considering
the similarity in their observations and ours, it is
possible that similar Drp1-independent ion homeostasismediated mechanisms underlie in the TRAIL-mediated
mitochondrial fragmentation. Further studies on the
possible role of LETM1 and ion homeostasis disruption
in the mitochondrial fragmentation in the pro-apoptotic
mitochondrial abnormalities are currently underway.
Another important finding in this study is that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

persistent depolarization is required for the proapoptotic mitochondrial network abnormalities, though
depolarization per se, did not cause mitochondrial
fragmentation and clustering (Figure 6A). αDR4, which
could induce minimal mitochondrial fragmentation and
clustering (Figures 3A, 3C, 3E, 6A), also induced minimal
depolarization together with minimal mitochondrial
dysfunction, caspase-3 activation, and apoptosis (Figure
5A-5D). However, in the presence of KCl or mdivi-1,
αDR4 induced substantial mitochondrial fragmentation
and clustering (Figure 6A). In addition, a considerable
level of apoptosis, comparable to that induced by TRAIL
or αDR5 alone, was observed under these conditions,
while KCl or mdivi-1 alone caused minimal apoptosis
(Figure 5C, 5D). These results suggest that depolarization
plays a pivotal role in the progression from non-apoptotic
to the pro-apoptotic mitochondrial network abnormalities,
though further studies are necessary to elucidate the
mechanisms by which depolarization elicits these effects.
It may be worthwhile to determine the molecular
basis of the tumor-specific mitochondrial network
abnormalities, because central targeting can be exploited
to enhance the induction of tumor-targeting apoptosis. In
expansion of our earlier work using Jurkat leukemia cells
[13], we found that mROS also contributed to TRAILinduced depolarization in melanoma cells (Figure 7A).
More importantly, DR ligation preferentially induced
depolarization and mROS accumulation in malignant cells
over normal cells (Figure 7B, 7C)
Collectively, our results imply that higher
depolarization and mROS accumulation in malignant
cells cause the tumor-selective mitochondrial network
abnormalities, leading to apoptosis (Figure 8).
In summary, we demonstrate in this paper that
TRAIL induces the mitochondrial network abnormalities
associated with apoptotic cell death in human malignant
cells, but not in normal cells and that depolarization
plays a critical role in this process. To our knowledge,
these findings are the first to show that TRAIL affects
the mitochondrial network in human malignant cells and
may provide insight into the molecular basis of the tumortargeting killing effect of TRAIL.

with 20 nM MitoTracker Red CMXRos and Hoechst
33342 (Dojindo) in HBSS for 1 h at 37°C in the dark in
a 5% CO2 incubator. The cells were then washed with
and immersed in FluoroBriteTM DMEM. Images were
obtained and analyzed using an EVOS FL Cell Imaging
System (Life Technologies Japan) equipped with digital
inverted microscope at ×1200 magnification. MitoTracker
Red and Hoechst 33342 signals were captured using Texas
Red and DAPI Light Cubes, respectively. For confocal
imaging, samples were observed using a laser scanning
microscopy with Airyscan (LSM 700 and 880, CarlZeiss microscopy Japan, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with
a oil-immersion objective (Plan Apochromat 63x/1.4;
Carl Zeiss) with 555/561 and 405 nm laser.. Images were
enlarged and analyzed for mitochondrial length using the
free NIH ImageJ software (NIH, USA) and ZEN lite 2012
(Carl-Zeiss).

Cell culture
The human melanoma cell lines, A549 cells
(human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line), and
osteosarcoma cell lines were obtained from Health
Science Research Resource Bank (Osaka, Japan). Human
dermal fibroblasts from facial dermis were obtained from
Cell Applications (San Diego, CA). These cell lines were
cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM;
Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich) (FBS/DMEM) in a 5% CO2
incubator. Normal human epidermal melanocytes were
obtained from Cascade Biologics (Portland, OR), and
cultured in DermaLife Basal Medium supplemented with
DermaLife M LifeFactors (Kurabo, Osaka, Japan). Cells
were harvested by incubation in 0.25% trypsin-EDTA
(Life Technologies Japan) for 5 min at 37°C.

Depolarization analysis
Depolarization was measured by flow cytometry
using bis-oxonol, an anionic dye that increases in
fluorescence intensity upon membrane depolarization,
as previously described [12]. Briefly, cells (4×105
cells/500 μl) suspended in HBSS were incubated with
100 nM dye for 15 min at 37°C, and then incubated with
the agents to be tested for 4 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2containing atmosphere. Subsequently, 1×104 cells were
counted for their fluorescence using the FL-2 channel
of a FACSCalibur and analyzed using the CellQuest
software. The data were expressed as F/F0, where F0
is the fluorescence in unstimulated cells and F is the
fluorescence in stimulated cells.

Apoptosis
Apoptotic cell death was quantitatively assessed by
double-staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)conjugated annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) as
previously described [12]. Briefly, cells (2 × 105/well)
in 24-well plates were incubated with the agents to be
tested for 24 h in FBS/DMEM at 37°C. Subsequently, the
cells were stained with FITC-conjugated annexin V and
PI using a commercially available kit (Annexin V FITC
Apoptosis Detection kit I; BD Biosciences Japan). The
stained cells were evaluated in the FACSCalibur (BD
Biosciences Japan) and analyzed using CellQuest software
(BD Biosciences). Four cellular subpopulations were
evaluated: viable cells (annexin V-/PI-); early apoptotic
cells (annexin V+/PI-); late apoptotic cells (annexin V+/
PI+); and necrotic/damaged cells (annexin V-/PI+). Annexin
V+ cells were considered to be apoptotic cells.

Caspase-3/7 activation and MMP collapse
Activation of caspase-3/7 and MMP collapse were
simultaneously measured by flow cytometry as previously
described [12]. Briefly, cells (2 × 105 /ml) in 24-well plates
were treated with the agents to be tested for 24 h in 10%
FBS/DMEM at 37°C, and then stained with the dual
sensor MitoCaspTM kit (Cell Technology, Mountain View,
CA). Caspase-3/7 activation and MMP were evaluated
using FACSCalibur according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, and the data were analyzed using CellQuest
software.

Mitochondrial network imaging acquisition and
length measurements
The mitochondrial network was analyzed by
staining with the mitochondria-targeting dye MitoTracker®
Red CMXRos (Life Technologies Japan) as previously
described [26] with minor modifications. Briefly, cells in
FBS/DMEM were placed at the density of 5 × 104/300 μl/
well on an 8-well chambered coverglass (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Rochester, NY) and treated with the agents to
be tested for 24 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. After
removing the medium by aspiration, the cells were washed
with Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS), and stained

mROS levels were measured using MitoSOXTM
Red (Life Technologies Japan) by flow cytometry and
the signals were calibrated as previously described [28].
Briefly, cells (5 × 105 /500 μl) suspended in HBSS were
incubated with the agents to be tested for 4 h at 37°C and

then incubated with 5 μM MitoSOX for 15 min at 37 °C
for loading. The cells were washed, resuspended in HBSS
on ice, centrifuged at 4°C and then analyzed for their
fluorescence using FACSCalibur. The data were analyzed
using CellQuest software and expressed as F/F0, where
F0 is the fluorescence of unstimulated cells and F is the
fluorescence of stimulated cells.

Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance
followed by the post-hoc Tukey test using an add-in
software for Excel 2012 for Windows (SSRI, Tokyo,
Japan). All values were expressed as mean±SE, and P <
0.05 was considered to be significant.

Drp1 knockdown

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Mitochondrial fission was inhibited by downregulating Drp1 expression using small interfering RNA
(siRNA) as previously described [26]. Cells (2.5 × 105 /
well) were plated in six-well plates and transfected with
20 nM of either Drp1-targeting siRNA (#sc-43732, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or scrambled control
siRNA (#sc-37007, Santa Cruz) using Lipofectamine
RNA/Max Kit (Life Technologies Japan) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions and cultured for 72 h at 37 °C
in a 5% CO2 incubator.

Immunoblotting

The authors declare no conflicts of interest.
The level of Drp1 was determined by
immunoblot analysis, as previously described [26]. The
phosphorylation of Drp1 was assessed by immunoblotting.
Briefly, cells (1.5 × 105/ml) were washed twice with
ice-cold PBS, lysed with RIPA buffer (Nacalai Tesque,
Kyoto, Japan) containing protease inhibitors, and
homogenized by sonication using a Bioruptor UCD-250
(Cosmo Bio, Tokyo, Japan). After centrifugation, the
resulting supernatant was measured for protein content
using a Pierce BSA Protein Assay Kit (Themo Fisher
Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
After heating at 70°C for 10 min, samples (15‒20 μg
protein) were subjected to reducing sodium dodecyl
sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
using a 10% separation gel (Life Technologies) and
transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes
(Life Technologies). The membranes were blocked
with Blocking One (Nacalai Tesque) for 1 h at room
temperature, washed with Tris-buffered saline containing
0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T), and then incubated with primary
antibody; phosphor-Drp1 (Ser616; #3455) or phosphorDrp1 (Ser637; #4867) (Cell Signaling Technology Japan,
Tokyo, Japan) overnight at 4 °C. After washing with
TBS-T, the membranes were incubated with secondary
antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The signal was
detected with the ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection
Reagent (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) using
GAPDH (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) as a loading control.
