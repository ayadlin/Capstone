ABSTRACT
Non-cytotoxic concentrations of microtubule targeting agents (MTAs) interfere
with the dynamics of interphase microtubules and affect cell migration, which could
impair tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. The underlying mechanisms however are
still ill-defined. We previously established that directed cell migration is dependent
on stabilization of microtubules at the cell leading edge, which is controlled by
microtubule +end interacting proteins (+TIPs). In the present study, we found that
eribulin, a recently approved MTA interacting with a new class of binding site on
β-tubulin, decreased microtubule growth speed, impaired their cortical stabilization
and prevented directed migration of cancer cells. These effects were reminiscent of
those observed when +TIP expression or cortical localization was altered. Actually,
eribulin induced a dose-dependent depletion of EB1, CLIP-170 and the tubulin
polymerase ch-TOG from microtubule +ends. Interestingly, eribulin doses that
disturbed ch-TOG localization without significant effect on EB1 and CLIP-170 comets,
had an impact on microtubule dynamics and directed migration. Moreover, knockdown
of ch-TOG led to a similar inhibition of microtubule growth speed, microtubule capture
and chemotaxis. Our data suggest that eribulin binding to the tip of microtubules and
subsequent loss of ch-TOG is a priming event leading to alterations in microtubule
dynamics and cancer cell migration.

INTRODUCTION

processes. Survival of cancer patients treated with
microtubule targeting agents (MTAs) is frequently limited
by tumor resistance to chemotherapies and progression
towards invasive and metastatic grades. Detailed
characterization of MTA binding to tubulin identified
distinct binding pockets, offering alternative opportunities
for treatments against tumor resistant to a site-specific
class of MTAs [2]. Consequently, a continuous effort
in natural product and medicinal chemistry generated
a wealth of MTAs with a diverse array of chemical
structures. Recently, eribulin (Halaven), a synthetic
analog of the sponge metabolite halichondrin B [3,

Natural products such as vinblastine and paclitaxel
are important anti-tumoral drugs [1]. Their mode of action
involves primarily the destruction of the microtubule
cytoskeleton forming the mitotic spindle, leading to cell
cycle arrest in mitosis and ultimately to cancer cell death.
At usual clinical doses, common side effects of these
chemotherapeutics are decreased neutrophil blood count,
due to the targeting of the fast renewing hematopoietic
tissues, and peripheral neurotoxicity which is thought
to occur via the poisoning of microtubule-rich neuronal

4], has been approved for the treatment of metastatic
breast cancer patients previously treated with regimens
including a taxane [5-7]. In phase III clinical trial, eribulin
significantly improved overall survival of women heavily
pretreated for metastatic breast cancer, highlighting a
clinical benefit of eribulin after failure of other regimens.
Several arguments have been put upfront to
challenge the idea that the antimitotic action is the sole
mechanism by which MTAs impede tumor progression [8,
9]. Targeting the few rapidly dividing cells in human solid
tumors cannot explain the effectiveness of these drugs,
leading to the hypothesis that MTAs also target interphase
cells [10]. This is supported by the observation that noncytotoxic concentrations of MTAs inhibit intracellular
trafficking [11]. Moreover, MTAs abrogate cancer and
endothelial cell migration at doses that affect microtubule
dynamics, without impacting microtubule mass [12].
Nevertheless, the underlying molecular mechanisms are
still unclear, even though studies suggested that MTA
might function by affecting localization of the EB1 +endbinding protein [13, 14]. The dynamics and stability of the
microtubule cytoskeleton is mainly regulated by proteins
interacting directly with microtubules and belonging to
distinct functional categories [15]: nucleating proteins
(including γ-tubulin), structural proteins (such as Tau and
MAP2), motors (dyneins and kinesins) and +end tracking
proteins or +TIPs (like EB1 or CLIP-170). We investigate
how cues controlling the complex network of microtubuleassociated proteins regulate cancer cell migration. In
particular, we have characterized signaling pathways by
which the ErbB2/HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase regulates
the cortical localization of EB1-binding proteins, allowing
capture and stabilization of EB1-decorated microtubules
at the leading edge of migrating breast cancer cells [1619]. We established that interference with +TIP expression
or localization prevents chemotaxis of breast cancer cells
in response to a gradient of heregulin (HRG), an ErbB
receptor ligand.
The activity of eribulin on metastatic breast cancer
may be due in part to an effect on cancer cell migration.
In the present study, we have investigated the effect of
eribulin on tumor cell motility and microtubule dynamics.
We found that subnanomolar concentrations of eribulin
impaired breast cancer cell chemotaxis and prevented
microtubule extension towards the leading edge. The
defect in peripheral microtubules was indistinguishable
from the one generated by the disturbance of the
membrane-associated protein complex and the +end
complex that are involved in microtubule capture at the
cell cortex [18]. Interestingly, eribulin treatment disturbed
the +end localization of EB1 and CLIP170, but also of
the tubulin polymerase ch-TOG. Finally, knocking down
ch-TOG recapitulated the effects of anti-chemotactic
concentration of eribulin suggesting that displacement of
ch-TOG from microtubule tip might be a priming event
in eribulin-induced disturbance of cancer cell migration.

We performed a cytotoxicity assay on three different
breast cancer cell lines representative of various molecular
breast cancer subtypes, and compared the effects of
eribulin with those of other MTAs, i.e. paclitaxel and
vinblastine (Figure S1). The ErbB2-overexpressing SKBr3
cells were the most sensitive to eribulin, relative to the

0.3 nM) than vinblastine (IC50 0.9 nM) and paclitaxel (IC50
2.2 nM) in SKBr3 cells (Figure S1B). Since the SKBr3
cells are a model cell line for investigating the role of
microtubules in cell migration, we focused our study on
this cell line. Upon addition of HRG, an ErbB2-activating
ligand, SKBr3 cells form wide protrusions, populated
by microtubules that extend to the cell periphery [16,

17]. Treatment with subnanomolar concentrations of
eribulin for 4 hours was not cytotoxic (Figure S2) and
did not affect HRG-induced membrane protrusions, but
strongly inhibited the extension of microtubules in these
protrusions (Figure 1A). This was reminiscent of the
phenotype observed when the interaction between the MTcapture complex at the plasma membrane and the +TIP
complex was disturbed [18]. Therefore, we evaluated
the number of cells displaying a captured microtubule
phenotype (i.e. cells with a large number of microtubules
extending within protrusions) vs. the number of cells in

which microtubules remained at a distance from the cell
periphery. The percentage of cells displaying microtubule
capture decreased in a dose-dependent manner starting
from eribulin doses as low as 0.1 nM (Figure 1B).
Noticeably, at 0.5 nM, eribulin reduced the percentage
of cells with captured microtubules as efficiently as the
knockdown of EB1, a master +TIP (Figure 1B).

HRG gradient for 4 hours (Figure 2A) and 8 hours (Figure
S4). We determined that exposure to 0.1 nM eribulin was
sufficient to strongly limit the efficiency of cell forward
migration (Figure 2B) and completely disorient migrating
cells (Figure 2A), similarly to EB1 down-regulation.
Interestingly, eribulin did not affect other parameters of
cell motility such as cell migration speed and directness,
even when increasing the concentration of eribulin to 0.5
nM and the exposure time to 8 hours (Figure 2B).

Eribulin prevented chemotaxis of breast cancer
cells

Inhibition of chemotaxis by eribulin occurred
in the absence of detectable effects on EB1 and
CLIP-170 comets

We previously established that defects in
microtubule capture at the cell cortex led to strongly
disturbed HRG-induced chemotaxis of breast cancer cells.
Thus, we measured the impact of eribulin on chemotaxis,
by tracking SKBr3 cells as they migrated in response to an

Since exposure to subnanomolar concentrations
of eribulin and EB1 knockdown have similar effects on
cortical microtubules and directed cell migration, we
analyzed whether eribulin treatment affected the function
of EB1 and of the microtubule- and EB1-binding protein
CLIP-170. Eribulin did not alter the expression levels of
EB1 or CLIP-170 (Figure S3B). Localization of EB1 and
CLIP-170 by immunofluorescence revealed an evident
loss of these proteins from microtubule +ends when cells
were treated with 1 nM of eribulin (Figure 3). At 0.1 nM
of eribulin, despite an obvious defect in microtubule
capture at the cortex, microtubules still appeared decorated
with EB1 and CLIP-170 comets. To quantify the impact of
subnanomolar concentrations of eribulin on +TIP comets,
we measured the length (Figure 4A) and the number
(Figure 4B) of EB1 and corresponding CLIP-170 comets.
The density of EB1 comets was strongly decreased
starting from 0.5 nM eribulin; EB1 comet number was
slightly decreased at 0.1 nM of eribulin, but this was
not significant for the corresponding CLIP-170 comets
(Figure 4B). The length of the remaining EB1 and CLIP170 comets was also considerably reduced above 0.5 nM
eribulin; but it was not significantly impacted by 0.1 nM
of eribulin (Figure 4A). Collectively, our results show
that the inhibition of microtubule capture and chemotaxis
by 0.1 nM of eribulin is not associated with a detectable
change in the length and density of +TIP comets, and thus
cannot be merely explained by the loss of EB1 or EB1associated +TIPs.

Since 0.1 nM eribulin treatment disturbed
microtubule capture, we examined whether this might be a
consequence of altered microtubule cytoskeleton dynamics
in SKBr3 cells. Because the treatment did not change EB1
comets, we measured microtubule dynamics by tracking
EB1 comets in SKBr3 cells stably expressing EB1-GFP.
We have previously verified that the SKBr3.EB1-GFP
cell line had the same sensitivity to eribulin than parental

SKBr3 cells (Figure S1C, IC50 value of 0.3 nM). Using the
+TipTracker software, we calculated multiple parameters
of microtubule dynamics and in the presence of eribulin at

0.1 nM, we observed an increase in the percentage of slow
microtubule tracks (Figure S5) and globally a significant
decrease in microtubule growth speed (Figure 4C) and
growth length (data not shown) relative to control, with
no significant change in the growth lifetime (Figure 4C)
or in rescue and catastrophe frequencies (data not shown).

Recruitment of ch-TOG at microtubule +ends was
altered by the anti-chemotactic dose of eribulin
The effect of 0.1 nM eribulin treatment on
microtubule capture and directed migration did not
correlate with the loss of EB1 or EB1-associated proteins.
Thus, we searched for other possible eribulin effectors that
could mediate its effects on microtubule capture. Among
+TIPs, ch-TOG was a relevant candidate: it is a tubulin
polymerase associating with the very tip of microtubules,
which tracks microtubule +ends independently of EB1
[20-22]. We observed that in SKBr3 cells ch-TOG had a
specific spot-like localization clearly distinct from EB1
comet-like labeling (Figure S6 and 5E). We found that
when ch-TOG expression was down-regulated (Figure
S3A), microtubule capture at the cell cortex was decreased
by 20% (Figure 5A) which was equivalent to the effect of
0.1 nM eribulin-treatment (Figure 1B). Down-regulation
of ch-TOG also prevented HRG-dependent chemotaxis
(Figure 5B), with no effect on cell migration speed
(data not shown). Noticeably, down-regulation of chTOG significantly reduced microtubule growth speed
(Figure 5C). These similarities between the effects of
0.1 nM eribulin treatment and depletion of ch-TOG on
microtubule dynamics and cancer cell migration raised
the possibility that eribulin disturbed ch-TOG localization
or function. Thus, we analyzed the impact of eribulin on
ch-TOG localization at the tip of microtubules (Figure 5D
and 5E). We observed a strong reduction of the number of
ch-TOG positive microtubule +ends, with a 44% decrease
at 0.1 nM of eribulin compared to untreated cells (Figure
5D). We have verified that eribulin treatment was not
altering the expression of ch-TOG (Figure S3C).
We further assessed that 0.1 nM-eribulin was
primarily delocalizing ch-TOG rather than EB1 from
microtubule +ends by determining the number of EB1
comets harboring a ch-TOG labeling in treated and
untreated cells (Figure 5E). We observed that in treated
cells, many microtubule +ends had lost ch-TOG labeling,
but still harbored EB1 comets: there was 25 % less chTOG labeled EB1 comets in eribulin treated cells relative
to untreated cells. These results indicate that low doses
of eribulin disturbed the recruitment of ch-TOG to
microtubule +ends and that the loss of ch-TOG induced a
decrease in microtubule growth speed and in microtubule
capture, and abrogated directed migration.

DISCUSSION

EB1 localization, we explored the impact of eribulin on
EB1. The anti-chemotactic dose of 0.1 nM eribulin had
no significant effect on EB1 and CLIP-170 localization,
but induced a detectable loss of ch-TOG from the
microtubule +ends. In addition, the down regulation of
ch-TOG also led to inhibition of microtubule growth rate,
microtubule capture and chemotaxis. Collectively, these
results suggest that eribulin-dependent delocalization of

ch-TOG from microtubule +end is sufficient to decrease
microtubules growth speed, independently of EB1, which
in turn affects microtubule capture at the cell cortex and
specifically prevents steering of cells in the direction of
the chemoattractant.
The observation that low doses of eribulin affect
primarily ch-TOG is consistent with recent models
suggesting that ch-TOG and EB1 bind to separate loci on
microtubule ends: ch-TOG associates with the frayed tip
of microtubules, whereas EB1 requires complete lateral
interactions of protofilaments [20, 23]. Yet the two proteins
are linked functionally, as the active incorporation of
GTP-tubulin dimers by ch-TOG maintains the generation
of new binding sites for EB1. This is probably why we
observed a strong decreased in the number of EB1 comets
upon ch-TOG knockdown (Figure S6) and upon treatment
with high doses of eribulin that have a drastic effect on
ch-TOG localization (Figure 5D).
Eribulin appears to impact microtubule dynamics
slightly differently than many antimitotic drugs, such as
vinblastine, by not altering catastrophe frequencies [4, 24].
In addition, eribulin inhibits the binding of vinblastine to
tubulin non-competitively indicating a different site of
interaction on β-tubulin [25]. In vitro, eribulin acts by
specifically affecting growth phases, in accordance with
our results in cells where it decreased microtubule growth
rate (Figure 4C) and length (data not shown). Eribulin
does not affect dynamic instability at microtubule minus
ends. It was also calculated that it binds to microtubule
with a maximum of 15 sites per microtubule [24]. These

pharmacological characteristics suggest that eribulin
targets more specifically the microtubule +ends.
We observed that ch-TOG localization at the
microtubule ends is remarkably sensitive to eribulin
treatment, relative to other +TIPs. How does eribulin
induce the loss of ch-TOG from microtubule +ends? We
speculate that by poisoning microtubule +ends, eribulin
binding to tubulin at substoichiometric concentrations
[4, 24] disturbs the binding of the tubulin polymerase chTOG, thereby impacting tubulin polymerization which
translates in a decrease of microtubule growth speed; this
does not require the delocalization of EB1 which occurs
at higher eribulin concentrations in our cancer cell model.
Molecular docking suggests that halichondrin B/eribulin
binds near β-tubulin loops H11-H11’ and H3’-H3 at the
interdimer interface [26] (Figure S7). Highlighting the
amino-acid residues of β-tubulin that are predicted to be
in contact with eribulin [26] and the amino-acid residues
of β-tubulin involved in the interaction with TOG1 domain
[27], shows that the presumed binding pocket of eribulin
and the β-tubulin-TOG interface are in close vicinity
(Figure 6). Therefore we speculate that, upon binding to
β-tubulin, eribulin induces a conformational change that
destabilizes the ch-TOG-tubulin complex. Recently, cocrystallization of tubulin dimers as parts of a TTL-T2S
complex with rhizoxin, maytansine or PM060184 revealed
a previously undescribed binding site on β-tubulin [28].
This site is shaped by loops S3-H3, S5-H5 and H11-H11’
and is located nearby the eribulin/halichondrin B docking
site (Figure S7), suggesting that eribulin belongs to the

Figure 6: The predicted eribulin binding site and the TOG-β-tubulin interface are juxtaposed. The model of the TOG1-

tubulin complex depicted by Ayaz et al [27] (PDB 4FFB) was used to highlight the amino-acid residues (sphere representation) of tubulin
that were predicted to be in contact with eribulin [26] in green, in contact with TOG1 in red or in contact with both in yellow. In the right

same family of MTAs. Binding of MTAs at this site would
directly prevent the addition of tubulin dimers at the
+end. Noticeably, T-DM1, a maytansinoid conjugated to
Trastuzumab was approved specifically for the treatment
of ErbB2/HER2-positive metastatic cancer [29], indicating
the potential benefit of targeting this novel MTA binding
site. Further experimentation will be necessary to
investigate how eribulin affects the interaction of ch-TOG
with the +end of microtubules and/or with tubulin dimers.
We previously found that localization at the cell
cortex of the EB1-interacting proteins APC (adenomatous
polyposis coli) and the spectraplakin ACF7 is required
for both microtubule capture and chemotaxis [18, 19],
underpinning a central role of EB1-mediated microtubule
anchoring at the leading edge for directed migration. How
does the loss of ch-TOG from microtubule +ends lead to a
defect in microtubule capture? Ch-TOG might mediate the
interaction of microtubules with proteins localized at the
cell cortex and thereby participates to microtubule capture
and stabilization. While we cannot exclude that ch-TOG
associates directly with cortical components, microtubule
+end cortical interactions are more likely driven by EB1,
which is known to bind SxIP motif-containing cortical
proteins [18, 22, 30-32]. Reconstitution experiments
strongly suggest that ch-TOG allosterically enhances
the binding of EB1 to the microtubule +end [22]. This is
consistent with the loss of EB1 from microtubule +ends
upon down regulation of ch-TOG in primary neurons,
NIH-3T3 fibroblasts [33, 34] and our own breast cancer
cell model (Figure S6). Thus, the impact of eribulin
on microtubule capture might be the consequence of
indirectly disturbing EB1 localization, as a result of the
loss of ch-TOG. These results also suggest reconsidering
the mechanism whereby low concentrations of other
MTAs, that decrease EB1 comet length, affect endothelial
and cancer cell migration [13, 14, 35].
Because SLAIN1 and 2 proteins were shown to act
as crosslinkers between EB1 and ch-TOG and participate
to the recruitment of ch-TOG to microtubule +ends [33],
one cannot exclude their possible contribution to eribulin’s
effect. However, it was observed that, in HeLa cells
where endogenous SLAIN proteins are expressed at low
levels, ch-TOG was not recruited to EB1 comets, but was
distinctively detected ahead of EB1 comets; strikingly,
overexpression of SLAIN led to perfect comet-like colocalization of ch-TOG and EB1 [20]. The localization
of ch-TOG ahead of EB1-comets in SKBr3 cells suggests
that SLAIN proteins do not have a major impact on chTOG recruitment on microtubule +ends. In addition,
downregulation of both SLAIN1 and 2 in neurons did not
affect microtubule growth rate; whereas downregulation
of ch-TOG induced a decrease in microtubule growth rate
in neurons [32] and in many other cellular models [32,
33, 35], including ours. Altogether these data indicate that
eribulin primarily displaces ch-TOG from microtubule
+ends.

While EB1 might mediate some of the effects
of eribulin on microtubule capture and chemotaxis, it
is important to observe that at 0.1 nM, eribulin barely
affected EB1 comet density and length, but prevented
directed migration, suggesting an alternative mechanism.
Interestingly, this low dose of eribulin induced a decrease
in microtubule growth speed, similar to the one observed
upon ch-TOG down regulation. This raised the possibility
that the change in microtubule growth speed was
responsible for preventing microtubule capture at the cell
cortex. We propose that directed migration rely on a tight
synchronization of microtubule assembly and leading edge
progression. Thus, slowing down microtubule growth at
protrusion inception would disconnect microtubules
from the fast forward progression of the leading edge,
thereby preventing their capture. In vitro, ch-TOG
strongly synergizes with EB1 for catalyzing the tubulin
incorporation at microtubule +ends to reach the 10-20
µm.min-1 microtubule growth speeds observed in cells
[22], indicating that it is a key physiological regulator
of microtubule growth. A recent study highlighted the
importance of a tight control of microtubule growth
speed during mitosis [36]. Indeed, colorectal cancer cell
lines presenting chromosome instability showed high
microtubule growth speed that was dependent on the
activity of the TACC3-ch-TOG complex. Interestingly,
microtubule growth speed could be brought back to values
found in chromosomally stable cell lines by either downregulation of ch-TOG or by subnanomolar concentrations
of microtubule interacting agents. Therefore, microtubule
growth speed may be a key factor for the regulation of
microtubule capture at both chromosome kinetochores
during cell division and cell cortex during cancer cell
migration.
The present study highlights that impairing
specifically the dynamics of the microtubule +end by
disturbing the associated protein, ch-TOG, inhibits some
aspects of cancer cell migration. Thus, further discovery
and development of compounds targeting specifically
microtubule +end, and the interaction of ch-TOG with
tubulin, may provide treatments of advanced cancers
therapeutics with improved therapeutic windows.

cells per well. Effect of the drugs on cell viability was
assessed with a sulforhodamine B assay [37] after 72 h of
drug exposure. The final concentration of DMSO (0.5%)
was the same for both drug-treated and control cells.

Transfection of siRNA and cDNA
Transfection of siRNA (30 pmoles) and cDNA
(3 µg) was performed by nucleofection (kit V) as
recommended (Lonza, Cologne, Germany). siRNA against
EB1 (sense strand: UUAAAUACUCUUAAGGCAUTT),
ch-TOG (sense strand: GAAAUACUCUUAAUUCUAATT)
and
LacZ
(control
siRNA;
sense
strand
GCGGCUGCCGGAAUUUACCTT) were synthesized
by Life technologies. Efficiency and specificity of siRNA
are presented in figure S3A. cDNA coding for EGFP-αtubulin was obtained from Clontech (Mountain View, CA);
mCherry-α-tubulin was a gift from Gia Voeltz, University
of Colorado, Boulder (Addgene plasmid # 49149).

Immunocytochemistry
SKBr3 cells were seeded at 105 cells per well in a
12-well plate containing collagen-coated glass coverslips.
After 48 h of culture, cells were treated with drugs (or
DMSO) for 4 h before addition of 1 nM of heregulin β1
(HRG; R&D Systems, Abingdon, United Kingdom) with
DMSO or drug for 30 min. Cells were fixed with methanol
containing 1 mM EGTA at -20°C for 10 min, followed by
4% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature.
In the case of ch-TOG labeling, cells were simply fixed
with methanol at -80°C for 10 min. Immunolabeling
was performed with antibodies against EB1 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), CLIP-170 (Synaptic Systems,
Goettingen, Germany), α-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich) or chTOG (a generous gift from Dr Lynn Cassimeris, Lehigh
University Bethlehem, PA) and secondary antibodies
labeled with DyeLight 405, AlexaFluor 488 or 594
(Jackson ImmunoResearch Europe, Suffolk, UK).
Images were acquired on a structured light ApoTome™
microscope (Zeiss, Münich, Germany) equipped with a
63x 1.4 plan ApoChromat objective and an Axiocam™
MRc5 camera.

Quantitation of the cell population with captured
microtubules by time-lapse video microscopy
SKBr3 cells expressing EGFP-α-tubulin were
either transfected with the indicated siRNA for 48 h, or
pretreated with 0.5% DMSO alone or with eribulin for 4 h,
before stimulation by 5 nM HRG and determination of the
percentage of cells showing captured microtubules over a
period of observation of 30 min. Detailed procedure has
been described previously [17].

Migration in Dunn chambers, cell tracking and
quantitation of chemotaxis
SKBr3 cells plated on collagen-coated coverslips
were exposed to a HRG gradient (10 nM HRG in the
outside well) in Dunn chambers. SKBr3 cells were
tracked for 4 to 8 h in the presence of eribulin. Detailed
procedure has been described previously [19]. Tracks
were analyzed using the Chemotaxis and Migration Tool
of ImageJ to calculate cell migration speed, directness
and forward migration index along the axis parallel to the
gradient (yFMI). The Rayleigh test for unimodal clustering
of directions was used to test directionality in the HRG
gradient. Distribution of directions was considered
uniform (random migration) for p>0.05. Definitions and
equations used to calculate these migration parameters are
presented in Supplemental Material and Methods.

Western blotting
Cells were lysed in a NP-40 based lysis buffer (50
mM Tris pH 7.5, NP-40 1%, 120 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM
EDTA, 1 mM DTT) supplemented with protease and
phosphatase inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics). Samples
were prepared as described previously [19]. Samples were
run on Novex NuPAGE Bis-Tris 4-12% polyacrylamide
gels (Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA) using a MOPS
based running buffer (50 mM MOPS, 50 mM Trisbase,
0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.7). Proteins were
transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and detected by
chemoluminescence using primary antibodies against EB1
(Pharmingen, BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA), α-tubulin
(Sigma-Aldrich), and ch-TOG (Ecrins Therapeutics,

Measure of microtubule dynamic parameters
SKBr3 cells stably expressing EB1-GFP (SKBr3.
EB1-GFP) were grown on collagen-coated glass bottom
dishes (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany) for
48 h. Medium was changed for DMEMgfp-2 (Evrogen,
Moscow, Russia) supplemented with 5 nM HRG. After

10 min, images of EB1-GFP comets were acquired
every 60 ms during 1 min, with a confocal spinning-disk
microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a 100x-oil objective and
a 491 nm laser with power tuned at 30%. For assessing
microtubule dynamics, images were analyzed with the
MatLab plug-in plusTipTracker [38]. The quality of the
movies was assessed by examining comet detection and
track linkage performance. Movies with high rate of false
positive or false negative detection were not used for
tracking. The same parameters were used for all movies:
search radius range: 5 to 12 pixels; minimum track length:
4 frames; maximum gap length: 12 frames; maximum
forward angle, 50°; maximum backward angle, 10°;
maximum shrinkage factor: 1.5; fluctuation radius, 1.5
pixels. Frame rate: 0.8 s-1 and pixel scale: 133 nanometers.

EB1 and CLIP-170 comet length was measured
using ImageJ and a line histogram plug-in (George
Patterson, Biophotonics Section, NIH). Each comet was
measured from head to tail using pixels with intensities
above 15. EB1 and CLIP-170 comet density in SKBr3 was
estimated using the spot detector function of freeware ICY
(icy.bioimageanalysis.org). Background noise was reduced
with ImageJ and a Gaussian filter was applied over images
with ICY. Spot detection was calibrated with size filtering:
from 3 to 3000 pixels; and scale: 3-7 pixels. The EB1 and
CLIP 170 comets detection was done over an identical
300 µm2 region of interest in protrusions. Images were
checked for false positive and false negative detection.
The presence of ch-TOG labeling at the tip of microtubule
+ends at the periphery of SKBr3 cells was manually
assessed on images displaying double fluorescent
labelling for tubulin and ch-TOG. The percentage of chTOG positive microtubules was determined on a total of
50 microtubules per cell in ten cells per condition in two
independent experiments. In an independent experiment,
the percentage of EB1 comets displaying a ch-TOG
labeling, irrespective of its fluorescence intensity, was
determined in a 900 µm2 area in five cells per condition.
In individual experiments, exposure time for each
fluorescence channel was the same for each condition
analyzed.
