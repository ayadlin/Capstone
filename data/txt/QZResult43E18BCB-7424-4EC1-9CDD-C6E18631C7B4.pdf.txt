BACKGROUND. The current study was conducted to determine the effect of goserelin and bicalutamide on progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer who were in second or greater complete disease remission.

METHODS. Patients received bicalutamide at a dose of 50 mg orally daily and
goserelin at a dose of 3.6 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks. CA 125 was obtained
monthly, with computed tomography performed every 3 months. Correlative studies included serum luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, vascular
endothelial growth factor, free testosterone, and androstenedione and the germline polymorphisms CYP19A1 and androgen receptor.

RESULTS. Between October of 2000 and October of 2002, 35 patients were enrolled. Three patients (9%) received therapy at the time of first disease remission
and were removed from the study, and 1 patient (3%) was removed for liver function test abnormalities. The most frequent toxicities were grade 1 alkaline phos-

noted between androgen receptor repeat number, genotype, allelotype, or haplotypes and PFS.

CONCLUSIONS. The use of goserelin and bicalutamide did not appear to prolong
PFS in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer in second or greater complete disease remission. The number of patients in disease remission at given time points
may serve as a clinical trial endpoint for future studies of consolidation therapy.

‘‘consolidation’’ or ‘‘maintenance’’ approaches to
patients in complete primary or subsequent disease
remission.4
A variety of hormones influence ovarian function,
although their role in ovarian carcinogenesis has been
controversial.5–7 Several studies have demonstrated the
predominance of androgen receptor (AR) (present in
67–96% of cases) over estrogen receptor (ER) (present
in 32–55% of cases) and progesterone receptor (PR)
(present in 46–52% of cases) in ovarian carcinoma.8–11
Plasma concentrations of androgens are greater than
those of estrogens during the late follicular phase of the
menstrual cycle12 and in the postmenopausal ovary, in
which 15-fold higher concentrations are noted in the
ovarian vein compared with peripheral vein serum.13
Some studies have shown that patients with ovarian
cancer have higher levels of circulating androgens
before the diagnosis of cancer is made than are found
in women without cancer14; others have refuted this
finding.15 Gonadotropin receptors also have been
shown to be expressed in at least 50% of ovarian surface
epithelial cells.16 In animal studies in F1-Wx/Wv mice,
which normally uniformly develop bilateral complex
tubular adenomas correlated with a 4-fold increase in
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), treatment with goserelin versus placebo
resulted in the significant suppression of gonadotropins
(P 5 .0005) and no tumor development (P 5 .00005).17
Finally, recent data have shown the importance of the
suppression of vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) in regulating ovarian cancer growth.18,19 Moreover, it has been suggested that loss of ovarian function
promotes tumorigenesis by resulting in increased
gonadotropins, which promote vascularization via increased levels of VEGF.20 Recent data also have supported the finding that testosterone replacement in
castrated rats increases mRNA levels of VEGF.21
This phase 2 study evaluated the hypothesis that
the inhibition of the androgen axis could result in a
decrease in tumor recurrence by inhibiting AR, reducing circulating gonadotropins, and suppressing
androgen-mediated VEGF production. Patients with
ovarian cancer in disease remission received goserelin
(a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue) and
bicalutamide (an oral nonsteroidal antiandrogen),
with progression-free survival (PFS) as the primary
endpoint and correlative studies characterizing androgens, AR, and coregulators as secondary endpoints.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
Eligible patients had 1) histologic confirmation of
epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian

2449

tube cancer at the time of diagnosis; 2) undergone
initial surgical cytoreduction and chemotherapy with
at least 1 platinum-containing regimen; 3) failure of
the primary regimen as manifested by recurrent disease; and 4) were in a complete clinical disease
remission (CR) after additional chemotherapy or surgery. Complete clinical remission was defined as a
CA 125 level 35 U/mL, negative physical examination, and no definite evidence of disease by computed tomography (CT) scan. Lymph nodes and/or
soft-tissue abnormalities measuring 1.0 cm are often present and may not be considered definite evidence of disease. Patients were permitted to have
entered a second or any subsequent clinical CR.
Patients had to have a Karnofsky performance status
(KPS) 60% and adequate organ function (defined as
an absolute neutrophil count 1500/lL, a platelet
count 100,000/lL, total bilirubin and serum creatinine 1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal, and aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline
phosphatase levels 2.5 times the institutional upper
limit of normal). Patients were excluded from the
study if they had received any investigational drug or
radiotherapy during the 4 weeks before study entry,
or had any uncontrolled cardiac, pulmonary, metabolic, renal, gastrointestinal, infectious disease, or
other history that placed them at an unacceptable
risk for participation in the study. The therapeutic
use of warfarin was not permitted.

Treatment Plan
The pretreatment evaluation included history and
physical examination, assessment of KPS, complete
blood cell count, hepatic function profile, serum creatinine, serum CA 125 level, electrocardiography, and
CT scan. During treatment, patients were evaluated
monthly with physical examination, and all laboratory
studies were repeated. CT scan was repeated every
3 months or sooner at the discretion of the investigator if disease progression was suspected. Bone density
was assessed within 6 months of the initiation of the
study, and yearly while the patient remained on study.
Patients received bicalutamide at a dose of
50 mg orally continually, and goserelin was administered at a dose of 3.6 mg subcutaneously every
4 weeks. No dose interruptions or modifications were
performed for grade 1 or grade 2 hematologic toxicity
or grade 1 nonhematologic toxicity. Patients were
removed from study for any hematologic toxicity of
> grade 3, unacceptable  grade 2 nonhematologic
toxicity, or at patient request.
Correlative Studies
Peripheral blood (20 mL) was obtained at baseline to
measure VEGF, FSH, LH, free testosterone, androste-

nedione, and estradiol levels. Repeated measurements were obtained every 12 weeks and at the time
of treatment failure. Germline DNA was extracted
from peripheral blood lymphocytes using standard
laboratory techniques. The trinucleotide CAG repeats
in exon 1 of AR was amplified using previously published primers.22 The short, long, and mean numbers
of repeats were calculated and evaluated for associations with PFS. The transcriptional transactivation
function of the AR protein in vitro is correlated inversely with the length of the polyglutamine tract
encoded by this repeat.23,24
Genotypes for 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) (rs4646, rs10046, rs2414096, and rs727479) in
CYP19A1 were determined. These haplotype-tagging
SNPs are representative of approximately 90% of the
genetic variation in the coding region of CYP19A1.
Recent data indicate that these haplotypes are associated with circulating hormone levels.25,26 Genotyping
was performed using a TaqMan allelic discrimination
assay detected on an ABI prism 7900 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster, Calif) with
high-fidelity reagents. The genotype completion rate
was 95%. Bayesian statistical methods were used to
reconstruct haplotypes from diploid genotype data.
This methodology was performed using the PHASE
program (version 2.1) by Stephens et al.27,28 Single loci
genotypes and haplotypes were compared with patient
outcome using the Fisher exact and log-rank tests. All
statistical tests were 2-sided.
Tissue blocks were requested to obtain unstained
slides. Representative slides of malignant tissue
(from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks)
were stained via immunohistochemistry for AR, PR,
and ER. Standard immunoperoxidase techniques
were used by the core facility at the Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center as outlined in the laboratory
procedures manual (1995 revision). Slides were
reviewed by the investigating pathologist (K.P.). A
semiquantitative method of scoring the staining pattern was used. Staining intensity was recorded as
weak (W), moderate (M), or strong (S). The quantity
of staining was expressed as a percentage of the tumor with 5% staining considered to be positive.

Study Endpoints
The endpoint of the current study was PFS. PFS was
defined based on the data from Rustin et al.29 Treatment failure was characterized by 1) evidence of tumor recurrence on physical examination or 2)
radiographic evidence of disease recurrence using
RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid
Tumors) criteria. Patients were removed from the
study at the time of treatment failure.

All patients provided written informed consent.
The protocol was approved by the institutional
review board annually.

Statistical Considerations
The objective of the current study was to estimate
the PFS for this intervention with the administration
of subcutaneous goserelin and oral bicalutamide in
patients in second or greater CR. The second PFS
was measured as the interval from the initiation of
secondary therapy to the date of the second disease
recurrence (PFS2). The third or fourth PFS was measured as the interval from the initiation of the third
or fourth therapy to the date of the third or fourth
disease recurrence (PFS3 or PFS4). PFS (protocol)
was defined as the time from the protocol start date
to disease progression or last follow-up for the
patients who did not develop disease progression.
PFS intervals were reported in months. The first PFS
(preprotocol intervention) was measured as the time
interval from the initiation of primary therapy to the
date of first disease recurrence (PFS1).
Historically, in the group of patients with a second or greater CR, the median PFS2 is 9 months to
10 months.30 We planned to accrue 35 patients at an
accrual rate of 3 patients per month, with follow-up
after accrual for an additional 2 years. A minimum
follow-up of 18 months was required to enable us to estimate the median time to disease recurrence with a 95%
confidence interval (95% CI) given by  4.5 months.
This degree of improvement was selected arbitrarily as
clinically meaningful. The 95% CI was computed
under the exponential survival model. We would
examine the treatment further if we observed a median
of >13.5 months.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Thirty-five patients were enrolled in the study from
October of 2000 to October of 2002 as described in
Table 1. The median age of the patients was 53 years
(range, 41–70 years) with a median KPS of 90%
(range, 80–100%). The majority of patients had stage
III (80%) or stage IV (11%) disease at the time of diagnosis, according to the TNM staging system. The
majority of patients (74%) underwent an initial optimal surgical cytoreduction. The majority had papillary serous (86%) or endometrioid (9%) histology,
with a minority having clear cell (5%) histology. All
patients received taxane and platinum-based primary
chemotherapy. Twelve patients (34%) underwent second-look assessment and 13 patients (37%) received
additional consolidation therapy. Twenty-three patients

(66%) underwent a surgical procedure at the time of
disease recurrence. The majority of patients were enrolled on protocol in second CR (60%), with other
patients enrolling in third (26%) or fourth (6%) CR.
Three patients (9%) received protocol therapy in first
disease remission after disease persistence and were
excluded from analysis. The median time from the
last administration of chemotherapy to the initiation
of protocol therapy was 1.6 months (range, 0.4–15.4
months). The median time on protocol therapy was
5 months (range, 5–24 months).

Treatment Toxicities
Three patients (9%) were treated in first disease remission and were removed from the analysis. One patient
(3%) was removed from treatment due to toxicity
(patient choice secondary to grade 2 elevated liver
function tests), 28 patients were removed for disease
progression, 1 patient was removed for newly diagnosed breast cancer, 1 patient withdrew consent, and
1 patient completed the planned 24 months of therapy and ended treatment in disease remission. Treatment was generally well-tolerated with no grade 3 or
4 toxicities attributed to protocol treatment. Grade 2
toxicities occurred in only a few patients as outlined
in Table 2: fatigue (8%), hemoglobin (3%), hot flashes
(3%), vaginal dryness (3%), and geranyl-geranyl
protein transferase type II (GGPT) elevation (3%). The

common being an elevation in the alkaline phosphatase level (54%), fatigue (57%), and hot flashes (43%).
Bone density examination was performed at baseline
and every 6 months while the patient received treatment. Considered categorically, baseline bone density
scores were normal (17%), osteopenia (63%), and
osteoporosis (20%). Seventeen patients had at least 1
follow-up study (6 months on study), and 1 of 17 had
a decline in bone density by 1 category.

Primary Treatment Endpoint: PFS
The PFS for patients receiving protocol therapy in
second disease remission (PFS2) (21 patients) was
11.4 months (95% CI, 10.2–12.6 months). The PFS for
patients receiving protocol therapy in third or fourth
disease remission (PFS3 or 4) (10 patients) was
11.9 months (95% CI, 10.8–14.1 months). The PFS
from the start of protocol therapy or PFS (protocol)
was 4.6 months (95% CI, 3.0–5.7 months) (Table 3).
The PFS (PFS1) for all evaluable patients on protocol (prestudy intervention) was 21.7 months (95%
CI, 16.1–31.4 months).
Exploratory Endpoints
For patients receiving protocol therapy in second disease remission only (21 patients), 3 patients (14%)
had a PFS2 > PFS1, with differences of 2.9 months,
15.4 months, and 38.6 months, respectively, as illu-

Table 5 describes the patients receiving protocol
therapy in second CR or greater and remaining disease free at given time points. The proportion of
patients remaining in second disease remission
among the 32 patients in second or greater CR versus

6 months, 72% at 9 months, 47% at 12 months, 28%
at 15 months, 22% at 18 months, 19% at 21 months,
and 13% at 24 months. Figure 1 shows the PFS
curves for all patients treated in second or greater
CR (Fig. 1A), and depicts the group treated in second
CR separately (Fig. 1B).

Immunohistochemistry
Nineteen patients (54%) had tumor blocks adequate
to obtain unstained slides for immunohistochemistry.
The results of AR, ER, and PR staining are shown in
Table 6. Eleven of 19 patients (58%) demonstrated
AR expression (defined as weak or strong and 5%
of cells with receptor), 14 patients (74%) demonstrated PR expression, and 10 patients (53%) demonstrated ER expression. Only 6 of the tested patients
(21%) were found to have all 3 receptors present.
Serum Levels of LH, FSH, and VEGF
Serum levels of LH, FSH, androstenedione, and VEGF
are summarized in Figure 2 as boxplots. The levels of
LH and FSH were uniformly suppressed in all patients
by the second month. Variability in VEGF levels
between patients is illustrated, but VEGF suppression
was not noted in treated patients. Testosterone and
androstenedione levels were low at the time of study
entry, and no further changes could be observed.

of 15 months as a cutoff point for the time-specific

a similar manner for CYP19A1. There were no associations found between single loci testing or haplotypes and any metric of PFS.

DISCUSSION
There is significant interest in investigating nontoxic
consolidation or maintenance therapeutic strategies
for patients with ovarian cancer in both primary and
secondary CR. Recent clinical data support the modest efficacy of aromatase inhibition in preselected
ER-positive patients with ovarian cancer, supporting
a possible role for hormonal manipulation.31 Likewise, the hypothesis that the inhibition of the andro-

gen axis could result in a decrease in tumor recurrence by inhibiting AR, thereby reducing circulating
gonadotropins, and by suppressing androgen-mediated VEGF production was soundly formulated from
preclinical data.8,12,14,16,17,21 The use of goserelin and
bicalutamide was found to be well-tolerated, with
the majority of toxicities reported as grade 1 or grade
2. Only 1 patient was discontinued from the study
because of toxicity. With regard to the primary efficacy endpoint, the intervention did not increase the
PFS to the predetermined value of 16.5 months
necessary for considering this approach worthy of
further study. Although not effective as a disease
remission maintenance strategy, it should be noted
that gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs have
demonstrated variable activity for patients with
measurable disease, with responses ranging from
12.5% (PFS of 8.7 months) to 4.3%, a small proportion of patients with stable disease, and minimal toxicity.32–34 Recognizing the modest activity of generally
short duration, it still may be reasonable to use this
or other hormonal strategies in patients with measurable disease who have no other more effective
options remaining, and who have a favorable toxicity
profile. However, current study data suggest that further investigation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone
analogs as a consolidation strategy is not warranted.
A lack of efficacy in prolonging disease remission
was noted despite the finding that the majority of
patients (58%) had positive AR staining by immunohistochemistry; this finding is in keeping with previously

Several additional observations can be drawn
from this study. With regard to our patient population, we demonstrated that sufficient numbers of
patients do return to CR (all of whom did so after
platinum-based reinduction chemotherapy) to justify
the study of interventions with the goal of prolonging
disease remission. We learned that not restricting the
study population to those in second CR results in
patients receiving the intervention at the third and
sometimes fourth CR timepoints, which unnecessarily complicates the analysis. For future studies, we
recommend restricting patients to second CR.
Furthermore, having no time restriction with regard
to when patients begin protocol therapy once CR is
reached resulted in a short median time from last
chemotherapy of 1.6 months, but ranged from 0.4 to
15.4 months. For comparisons with the literature, it
is necessary to report PFS2 or PFS3 as the time from
the initiation of chemotherapy to disease progression. For future studies, we will institute an eligibility
criterion requiring patients to enter the study within
4 months of their disease returning to CR.
Because the majority of patients in the current
study (21 patients) received protocol therapy in second CR, we considered them separately as well
as part of the total patient population. The use of
goserelin and bicalutamide resulted in a PFS2 of
11.4 months in this cohort of patients treated at the
time of second CR, and this is within the range of
patients reported in the literature who were treated
at the time of second disease recurrence and followed with observation.35
Recent data have suggested that a simple determination of the median PFS may not be the most suitable endpoint for consolidation trials. Other suggested
endpoints have included the proportion of patients
achieving a second CR that is longer than the first,3 or
patients continuously in CR at given time points.36 In
our study, 3 of 21 patients with a second CR had a second CR that was longer than the first (14%), with 2 of
these patients (9.5%) having clinically meaningful differences. This fits with previously published data that
second CRs are infrequently longer than the first, and
that these protocol-treated patients are similar to
those who are observed. No unique features could be
identified among the 3 patients with a second CR that
was longer than the first (none had undergone secondary surgery), and there were no detectable differences noted in hormone levels. AR was not present in
any of these patients. Finally, the percentage of
patients in CR at different time points is reported, and
this may serve as a potential benchmark for subsequent studies once validation using a larger observed
dataset is performed.

The use of goserelin and bicalutamide did not
appear to prolong the PFS of patients with epithelial
ovarian cancer in a second or greater CR. The number of patients with a second CR that was longer
than the first remained infrequent. The number of
patients remaining in CR at given timepoints is
reported herein and may serve as a clinical trial endpoint for future consolidation studies if validated in
sufficient numbers of patients.
