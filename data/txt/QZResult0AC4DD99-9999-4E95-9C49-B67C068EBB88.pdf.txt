BACKGROUND: The Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG) 77B trial examined the relative efficacy of levamisole, single-agent oral cyclophosphamide, and the classic combination of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5fluorouracil (CMF) against no adjuvant systemic therapy in high-risk breast cancer patients. The authors report the
results from that trial after a potential follow-up of 25 years. METHODS: Between 1977 and 1983, 1146 premenopausal
patients who had tumors >5 cm or positive axillary lymph nodes were assigned randomly to 1 of 4 options: no systemic therapy, levamisole 5 mg weekly for 48 weeks (the levamisole arm), oral cyclophosphamide 130 mg/m2 on
Days 1 through 14 every 4 weeks for 12 cycles (the C arm), or oral cyclophosphamide 80 mg/m2 on Days 1 through 14
plus methotrexate 30 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 intravenously on Days 1 and 8 every 4 weeks for 12 cycles
(the CMF arm). RESULTS: The 10-year invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) rate was 38.6% in the control arm compared with 55.5% in the C arm, 48.8% in the CMF arm, and 35.2% in the levamisole arm. Compared with the control
arm, the hazard ratio for an IDFS event was 0.62 in the C arm (P ¼ .001) and 0.70 in the CMF arm (P ¼ .01). The hazard ratio for death was 0.70 in both the C arm (P ¼ .02) and the CMF arm (P ¼ .02) at 10 years, and the overall survival (OS) benefit was maintained during 25 years of follow-up. No significant differences were observed in IDFS or
OS between the C arm and the CMF arm or between the levamisole arm and the control arm. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with controls, both cyclophosphamide and CMF significantly improved disease-free survival and OS, and the
benefits persisted for at least 25 years in premenopausal patients who had high-risk breast cancer. Cancer

In 1971, Nissen-Meyer and colleagues presented their first report on the efficacy of short-term, single-agent cyclophosphamide (C) as adjuvant treatment for early breast cancer.1 A few years later, a similar benefit was demonstrated with single-agent melphalan by the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) and with prolonged C,
methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) by the Milan group.2,3 Results from a few other trials of monotherapy (mainly
melphalan) and several trials of polychemotherapy (mainly CMF) were published in the succeeding 10 years and have
been combined in a series of meta-analyses by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group (EBCTCG).4-7 Indirect comparison of monochemotherapy and polychemotherapy revealed a significantly less favorable effect of monotherapy. Consequently, polychemotherapy turned out to be used more widely and, thus, is documented better.
Levamisole is a succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor that has been used as an immunosuppressive agent in childhood
nephritic syndrome and as an anthelmintic in animals.8,9 Anticancer effects of levamisole have been explored primarily as

adjuvant therapy in patients with colon cancer Dukes type
B2-B3 and type C.10,11 The mechanism of action of levamisole remains largely unresolved. Originally, it was presumed that levamisole had an immunostimulant effect;
however recent studies suggest that it has an antiangiogenic effect.12 Here, we report the 25-year results of the
Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG) 77-B
trial, which randomized premenopausal women with
high-risk, early breast cancer to receive either radiotherapy
alone, or radiotherapy plus levamisole, or radiotherapy
plus oral C, or radiotherapy plus classic CMF.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This open-labeled, randomized, phase 3 trial involved
centers nationwide in Denmark.13 The organization of
the DBCG and the design of the clinical database have
been described previously in detail.14
Patients
The 77-B trial included premenopausal women who
underwent complete resection for a unilateral, invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast by mastectomy with axillary
sampling or clearance (level I and part of level II). Patients
were required to have axillary lymph node metastases,
tumors >5 cm, or invasion of the deep fascia without distant metastasis. Informed consent was obtained from each
patient before the start of treatment.
Pathologic Procedures
Classification of histologic type according to the World
Health Organization, grading (ductal carcinomas) according to Elston and Ellis,15,16 examination of tumor margins, invasion into skin or deep fascia, measurement of
gross tumor size, total number of lymph nodes identified,
and total number of metastatic lymph nodes were evaluated and reported prospectively. Estrogen, progesterone,
and HER2 receptor proteins were not measured.
Treatment
Eligible patients were assigned to radiotherapy alone (control), radiotherapy plus 2.5 mg/kg of levamisole on 2 consecutive days each week for 48 weeks, radiotherapy plus
12 cycles of single-agent C 130 mg/m2 orally on Days 1
through 14 every 4 weeks, or radiotherapy plus 12 cycles
of CMF (C 80 mg/m2 orally on Days 1 through 14, methotrexate 30 mg/m2 intravenously on Days 1 and 8, and 5fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 intravenously on Days 1 and 8)
every 4 weeks. Guidelines for dose modification were
reported previously.13

2082

Endocrine therapy (eg, tamoxifen or ovarian suppression) was not permitted. Radiotherapy was given concomitant with chemotherapy to the chest wall and
regional lymph nodes, and 2 different schedules were used
(40.92 grays [Gy] in 22 fractions at 5 fractions per week
or 36.60 Gy in 12 fractions at 2 fractions per week).
Follow-Up
Treatment-related adverse events and findings on clinical
examination were recorded every 4 weeks during the first
year, then every third month during the second year, every
6 months during the third to fifth years, and annually
thereafter up to a total of 10 years. In addition, long-term
follow-up was acquired on survival through linkage to the
Danish Central Population Registry and on second
primary nonbreast cancers through linkage to the population-based Danish Cancer Registry. However, myelodysplastic syndrome is not reported to the Danish Cancer
Registry. Hemoglobin levels, white blood cell counts, and
platelet counts, were determined on Day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle. Additional biochemical tests and imaging
studies were obtained when indicated by existing symptoms or signs.
Statistical Analysis
The DBCG Data Center undertook a central review,
query, and analysis of data. Follow-up was quantified in
terms of a Kaplan-Meier estimate of potential followup.17 Overall survival (OS) was calculated as the elapsed
time from the date of randomization until death, irrespective of the cause of death. Invasive disease-free survival
(IDFS) was defined as the duration of survival without
invasive locoregional recurrence, distant metastases, contralateral invasive breast cancer, second primary nonbreast
invasive cancer, or death irrespective of the cause.
Primary efficacy analyses included comparisons of
IDFS and OS between active treatment with C, CMF,
and levamisole versus the control arm. A 5-year recruitment period was intended; and, with a yearly enrollment
of 300 patients, the sample size would approximate 1500
patients. The expected 5-year IDFS was 65%. With 730
patients in each comparison arm and an additional 2-year
follow-up, the trial could approach an 80% power (2sided alpha ¼ .05) to detect a 10% improvement in 5year survival. Secondary comparisons, including comparisons between the C and CMF arms, were not specified in
advance. The overall recruitment period was not changed
when the steering committee decided to close the levamisole arm and, later, the control arm.

Six patients emigrated and were censored 6 to 27 years after randomization.

OS and IDFS were analyzed unadjusted according
to an intent-to-treat principle, and the treatment regimens
were compared using the log-rank test. To avoid bias, we
restricted the intent-to-treat analysis to patients who
actually were included during the study period when randomization took place in all study arms for each specific
comparison. For multivariate analysis of patients who
were treated according to protocol, a Cox proportional
hazards regression model was applied to assess the
adjusted hazard ratio of IDFS and OS by treatment regimen and to explore interactions. Factors that were
included in the multivariate analyses were age (40 years,
41-45 years, 46-50 years, and 51-59 years), tumor size (02 cm, >2-5 cm, and >5 cm), lymph node status (0-3 positive lymph nodes, 4-9 positive lymph nodes, and >9 positive lymph nodes combined with 0-9 lymph nodes
examined or >9 lymph nodes examined), histologic type
and grade (ductal grade 1 and unknowns, ductal grade 2,
ductal grade 3, and other histologic types), and treatment.
Invasion of the deep fascia was of no significance and was
not included. Interactions between treatment and the
covariates age, positive lymph nodes, and tumor size were
investigated in categories and in separate models. Proportional hazards assumptions were assessed by using Schoenfeld residuals and by including a time-dependent
component in the model for each covariate. The hazard
rates for histologic type and grade were not proportional;

Cancer

therefore, stratification was used. To comply with the proportional hazards assumption regarding treatment regimens, separate estimates were included according to the
time since randomization. For OS, the Wald test was used
to assess heterogeneity. Associations between regimen and
other characteristics (excluding unknowns) were analyzed
by using chi-square or Fisher exact tests. P values are 2tailed, and no adjustment was applied that took into
account the number of comparisons. Details regarding
the calculation of standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for
second primary cancers have been described previously.18
Statistical analyses were done with the SAS 8.2 software
program package (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
DBCG trial 77B was open from November 1977 to January 1983, and Table 1 shows the cumulative assignment
to the 4 treatment arms. The levamisole arm was closed in
December 1979 because of side effects, and the patients
who were receiving levamisole were discontinued in case
of side effects. An interim analysis at closure suggested
that the levamisole arm could not gain superiority, a consideration that also led to closure of the control arm in
January 1981.19 Recruitment to the single-agent C and
CMF arms was closed in January 1983 after a second interim analysis.13 Complete follow-up for survival analysis

was available for 1140 patients (99.5%), whereas 6
patients emigrated 6 to 27 years after randomization.
Thirteen patients were lost to follow-up for recurrence,
and 61 patients were excluded in the per-protocol analysis
(Table 1). The randomization was well balanced, and
there were no significant differences between the 2 chemotherapy arms (Table 2) or between the control arm and
the 2 chemotherapy arms at the closure of randomization
to the control arm (data not shown). Apart from malignancy grade, no significant differences were observed
between the levamisole arm and the control arm at the
time the levamisole arm was closed. For each of these
comparisons, patients who were randomized within the
relevant strata were included in the analyses according to
the intent-to-treat principle.
Treatment
The per-protocol patients received a mean of 22 weeks of
treatment with levamisole, 44 weeks of C, and 41 weeks
of CMF. The proportion of patients that received treatment for 36 weeks was 0.30 for levamisole, 0.83 for C,
and 0.75 for CMF.

Invasive Disease-Free and Overall Survival
This analysis was conducted 25 years after closure of
recruitment to the chemotherapy arms. With a median
estimated potential follow-up of 10 years, 557 first events
were observed, including 112, 71, 183, and 191 first
events in the control, levamisole, C, and CMF arms,
respectively (Table 3). IDFS was improved significantly
for the C and CMF arms compared with the control arm
with hazard ratios [HRs] of 0.62 (95% confidence interval
[CI], 0.46-0.83; P ¼ .001) and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.53-0.93;
P ¼ .01), respectively (Fig. 1, Top). The middle chart in
Figure 1 illustrates the Kaplan-Meier curves in the C arm
versus the CMF arm; in this curve, no significant difference was noted in IDFS at 10 years (HR, 0.95; 95% CI,
0.77-1.16; P ¼ .59). A significant difference in IDFS also
was not demonstrated between the levamisole and the
control arm (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.74-1.43; P ¼ .86)
(Fig. 1, Bottom). When adjusting for baseline characteristics, including age, lymph node status, tumor size, histologic type, and grade, the effect of treatment on IDFS was
broadly similar to the result obtained when accounting for
treatment alone for C versus control (adjusted HR, 0.60;
95% CI, 0.47-0.78; P < .0001), for CMF versus control
(adjusted HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.46-0.77; P < .0001), for
levamisole versus control (adjusted HR, 1.16; 95% CI,

0.70 (95% CI, 0.52-0.95; P ¼ .02); for CMF versus control, the HR was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.52-0.94; P ¼ .02); and,
for levamisole versus control, the HR was 1.01 (95% CI,
0.72-1.42; P ¼ .95). There was no significant difference
in survival between the chemotherapy arms at 10 years (C
vs CMF: HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.90-1.38; P ¼ .32).
With a median estimated potential follow-up of 25
years, 753 of 1146 patients had died. With prolonged follow-up, there was no significant difference in survival
between the control arm and the C arm (HR, 0.80; 95%
CI, 0.63-1.03; P ¼ .08), whereas a significant difference
was observed between the control arm and the CMF arm
(HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.57-0.93; P ¼ .01). Still, there was
no significant difference in survival between the C arm
and the CMF arm at 25 years (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.921.29; P ¼ .32). After adjusting for baseline characteristics,
a significant difference in survival was conserved between
the control arm and the C arm (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.510.86; P ¼ .002) and between the control arm and the
CMF arm (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.45-0.77; P ¼ .0001).
Figure 2, Top indicates that there was change in
HRs for survival with time, and an exploratory Cox multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that the survival
benefits from C and CMF were obtained primarily during
Years 5 through 10 (Fig. 2, Bottom). In the multivariate
analysis, there was a statistically significant interaction
between time period and treatment with C (P ¼ .007)
and CMF (P ¼ .03).
A qualitative interaction (P ¼ .01) for mortality was
observed between time since randomization and treatment with levamisole. In the first 5 years, a nonsignificant,

Cancer

detrimental trend was observed (levamisole vs control:
HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.86-1.89; P ¼ .23) compared with a
significant benefit of levamisole after 5 years (HR, 0.64;
95% CI, 0.42-0.97; P ¼ .03). The adjusted HR for OS in
the first 5 years was 1.26 (95% CI, 0.83-1.92; P ¼ .29) in
the levamisole arm compared with the control arm, and
after 5 years the HR was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.43-1.04; P ¼
.07) (P ¼ .03 for interaction).
Figure 3 illustrates the effects of C and CMF on survival within subgroups of baseline characteristics; and,
because no statistical evidence of heterogeneity comparing
C and CMF was revealed regarding the effect on OS compared with the control arm, those groups were analyzed as
a single group in the exploratory subgroup analyses. There
was a statistically significant interaction between tumor
size and chemotherapy in which patients with small
tumors experienced a more favorable outcome with chemotherapy (P ¼ .01 for interaction). No other interactions
between the baseline characteristics and chemotherapy
were statistically significant.
Toxicity
Serious adverse events were reported in the levamisole
arm in terms of agranulocytosis in 2 patients and leucopenia in 13 patients. Overall treatment with levamisole was
discontinued in 50% of patients because of toxicity as
reported previously.19 Toxicities the first year after randomization and ovarian suppression mediated by chemotherapy also have been reported previously.13
In total, 100 patients (9%) developed a second nonbreast primary cancer. Of these, 12 cancers developed

patients were diagnosed with lung cancer, and this was the
only site with a significantly increased risk (SIR, 2.09;
95% CI, 1.36-2.83). The risk of lung cancer did not differ
significantly between patients who were randomized to
receive radiotherapy alone (SIR, 2.23), radiotherapy plus
levamisole (SIR, 1.57), C (SIR, 1.93), or CMF (SIR,
2.32). Bladder cancer was reported in 5 patients who had
received C (SIR, 3.17; 95% CI, 0.39-5.94), in 3 patients
who had received CMF (SIR, 1.93; 95% CI, 0.00-4.12),
and in none of the patients who received levamisole or
radiotherapy alone. Acute leukemia was reported in 2
patients who received C (SIR, 6.21; 95% CI, 0.00-14.8),
in 2 patients who received CMF (SIR, 6.14; 95% CI,
0.00-14.6), in 1 patient who received levamisole (SIR,
13.3; 95% CI, 0.00-39.4), and in none of the patients
who received radiotherapy alone. In addition, 56 other
second primaries were reported in 17 different sites without any distinctive pattern.

DISCUSSION
In this 25-year analysis of DBCG trial 77B, we observed a
significant improvement in IDFS and OS after treatment
with oral C or classic CMF compared with patients who
did not receive adjuvant systemic therapy. The survival
benefit arose for the most part 5 to 10 years after randomization, and the survival benefits achieved at 10 years persisted up to 25 years after randomization. The time
dependency is apparent in both the adjusted and the
unadjusted analyses. No significant difference in IDFS or
OS was observed between the patients who received oral
C and those treated who received classic CMF; however,
this was not a primary analysis, and the study was not
powered adequately to address this issue. However, as
expressed in the relatively narrow CI (HR, 1.09; 95%CI,

0.92-1.29), the number of events in the explanatory 25year mortality analysis would have allowed us to detect a
relatively small size effect.20 In our study, there was a significant interaction between treatment and tumor size, in
which patients with tumors >5 cm experienced a less
favorable outcome with the use of chemotherapy.
To our knowledge, this is the only report to demonstrate a comparable effect of monotherapy with oral C
and classic CMF. Our results indicate that, clinically, C is
the most important drug in the CMF combination. A
meta-analysis that included <3500 patients from the current trial and from another 12 trials comparing single-

agent mephalan (11 trials) or fluorouracil (1 trial) with
CMF or CMF-like regimens reported significantly better
DFS and OS with polychemotherapy compared with single agents.5 Indirect comparisons within the EBCTCG
meta-analysis also demonstrated the significant heterogeneity of effects according to regimen, and prolonged
chemotherapy was associated with the largest clinical benefit. However, major differences have been demonstrated
between C and melphalan, including high versus low bioavailability and extensive versus modest metabolization.21
Therefore, whether the results obtained with melphalan
in adjuvant trials may be generalized to C remains questionable. Bonadonna and colleagues reported long-term
benefits of classic CMF in premenopausal, high-risk
patients but did not specify whether the survival benefit
was related to time elapsed.22 The EBCTCG meta-analysis published in 2005 identified no significant trend
between Years 0 to 4, Years 5 to 9, and Years 10 to 14 in
the ratio (polychemotherapy vs control) of the annual
death rates.7 The absolute gain observed in the meta-analysis was at least twice as great for 15-year survival as it was
for 5-year survival. The results from our trial and from the
trial by Bonadonna et al indicate that further follow-up is
desirable with the aim of making the 25-year results available within the EBCTCG.
The dose and schedule of C have been considered

combination regimen. Indirect and retrospective comparisons have suggested, however, that classic CMF using
oral C is superior to intravenous CMF. Classic CMF with
oral C was used in the current study and, to our knowledge, has not been compared directly with intravenous
regimens or with regimens that included a lower dose intensity of C in randomized trials in the adjuvant setting.
In a retrospective cross-trial comparison, we have demonstrated a 30% increase in the risk of recurrence and death
when shifting from the current classic CMF regimen to
intravenous and less dose-intense, 3-weekly or 4-weekly
CMF regimens.23 The intended dose of C in the current
trial was 80 mg/m2 given as part of the CMF regimen
compared with 100 mg/m2 in the original Milan trial.3 A
retrospective subgroup analysis of the Milan trial indicated that the very small subgroup of 42 patients that
received a dose intensity of 85% had a better outcome,
but evidence of an interaction between dose intensity and
outcome has not been presented. The NSABP evaluated
dose intensity and total dose of intravenous, 3-weekly C
combined with doxorubicin in trials B22 and B25 and
could not demonstrate any benefits even with a 4-fold
increase in the dose of C.24,25
Amenorrhea, defined as the absence of menstrual
bleeding for 3 months in the first year, was slightly more
frequent in the patients who received C (70%) compared
with patients who received CMF (63%).26 However, in
the absence of information on estrogen receptor status,
biochemical monitoring of ovarian function, and prolonged follow-up regarding menstrual bleeding, we are
unable to analyze in detail the possible impact of amenorrhea. Chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea in general has
been associated with a therapeutic benefit, especially in
very young women with hormone-sensitive breast cancer,
although controversy remains.27
The risk of second primary cancers did not increase
significantly for all sites combined, and lung cancer was
the only site with a significantly increased risk. Lung cancer potentially is inducible by postmastectomy radiotherapy, and the risk seems to be related inversely to age.18
These findings emphasize the importance of improving
selection criteria for radiotherapy and the techniques used
for radiotherapy planning.
We observed a possible long-term survival benefit of
adjuvant levamisole, but this was counteracted by a trend
in the opposite direction during the first 5 years. Because
of the early closure of the levamisole arm, the comparison
had low power. Our finding has no clear clinical relevance
but warrants caution against early analyses of newer and

2088

possibly more potent antiangiogenic agents. Our results
are in agreement with the overview published in 1992, in
which the EBCTCG compiled the early results from 2154
patients in 9 trials and demonstrated no significant benefit
with drugs that were considered to be immunostimulants.5 An update of the EBCTCG analyses could be considered worthwhile in light of the current findings.
Our study has 3 substantive clinical implications.
First, C should continue to be recognized as an essential
component of chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting.
Survival benefits were observed with single-agent C and
with CMF, and there is a lack of direct comparisons indicating whether regimens without C are inferior to regimens that contain it. Second, early and late results
differed, and >10 years of follow-up were necessary to
demonstrate a lack of proportionality between HRs.
Long-term follow-up may be particularly important in
trials that evaluate antiangiogenic drugs. A difference
between early and late results also warrants caution
against replacing adjuvant trials with neoadjuvant trials.
Third, the risk of second cancers was increased only marginally and seemed to be related more closely to radiotherapy than to systemic therapies.
