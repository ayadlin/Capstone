BACKGROUND: In the AZA-001 trial, azacitidine (75 mg/m2/d subcutaneously for Days 1-7 of every 28-day cycle)
demonstrated improved survival compared with conventional care regimens in patients with International Prognostic
Scoring System-defined intermediate-2- or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome and World Health Organizationdefined acute myeloid leukemia with 20% to 30% bone marrow blasts. METHODS: This secondary analysis of the
AZA-001 phase 3 study evaluated the time to first response and the potential benefit of continued azacitidine treatment beyond first response in responders. RESULTS: Overall, 91 of 179 patients achieved a response to azacitidine;
responding patients received a median of 14 treatment cycles (range, 2-30). Median time to first response was 2
cycles (range, 1-16). Although 91% of first responses occurred by 6 cycles, continued azacitidine improved response
category in 48% of patients. Best response was achieved by 92% of responders by 12 cycles. Median time from first
response to best response was 3.5 cycles (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.0-6.0) in 30 patients who ultimately
achieved a complete response, and 3.0 cycles (95% CI, 1.0-3.0) in 21 patients who achieved a partial response. CONCLUSIONS: Continued azacitidine therapy in responders was associated with a quantitative increase in response to a
higher response category in 48% of patients, and therefore may enhance clinical benefit in patients with higher-risk

The prognosis of patients with International Prognostic Scoring System-defined intermediate-2- or high-risk myelodys-

plastic syndrome (MDS) is poor, with a median survival of 1.2 and 0.4 years, respectively.1 Most deaths are attributable to
infection, hemorrhage, complications related to anemia or transfusions, or transformation to acute myelogenous leukemia
(AML). Consequently, the primary goals of treatment for patients with International Prognostic Scoring System-defined
intermediate-2- and high-risk disease are to improve bone marrow function, suppress AML transformation, and prolong
survival. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the only potentially curative treatment for MDS. However, the vast
majority of patients with MDS are ineligible for transplantation because of advanced age, comorbidities, or the lack of a
suitable donor.2
The international phase 3 trial AZA-001 established that the cytidine nucleoside analog azacitidine significantly prolonged median overall survival by >9 months and significantly delayed median time to AML transformation by >6
months compared with conventional care regimens.3 Azacitidine was also associated with significant improvements in
other clinically relevant outcomes, including reductions in transfusion need, hospitalization and intravenous antimicrobial

use,3 and improvements in quality of life.4 In this trial,
treatment with azacitidine was continued regardless of
response until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity; patients assigned to azacitidine were treated for a median of 9 cycles.3
Azacitidine is incorporated into both DNA and
RNA. DNA incorporation decreases DNA hypermethylation, allowing the re-expression of previously silenced
genes that may include tumor suppressor genes.5 The
incorporation of azacitidine into DNA is cell cycle Sphase dependent and requires exposure during multiple
cycles of DNA replication,6 with hypomethylation occurring gradually; therefore, multiple or prolonged exposure
to the drug is required for maximal demethylation. Furthermore, when azacitidine is discontinued, aberrant promoter methylation and gene silencing return. Results
from previous clinical studies suggest that continued azacitidine therapy may increase patient benefit.7-10 Therefore, we conducted a secondary analysis of data from the
AZA-001 patients who achieved a response to azacitidine
therapy, to determine the time to first response, and
whether continued treatment was associated with further
improvement in response category.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This analysis included all patients who responded to azacitidine during the phase 3, international, multicenter,
randomized, controlled, parallel-group, open-label AZA001 trial; this has been described in full previously.3 The
original phase 3 trial (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00071799)
was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki,
approved by the institutional review boards of the participating study sites, and all patients provided written
informed consent. Eligible patients had International Prognostic Scoring System-defined intermediate-2- or high-risk
MDS and French-American-British–defined refractory
anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation, or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with 10%
bone marrow blasts and a white blood cell count <13 
109/L.1,11 Patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 to 2 and
estimated life expectancy of 3 months were included,
whereas those with treatment-related MDS, prior azacitidine, decitabine, or chemotherapy treatment, or planned
allogeneic stem cell transplantation were ineligible.
The protocol specified that azacitidine should be
administered subcutaneously at a dose of 75 mg/m2 daily
for the first 7 days of each 28-day cycle, and for at least 6

2698

cycles. Treatment was to be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity was observed. After
treatment discontinuation, all patients were followed until
death or study completion. All patients could receive best
supportive care, including the use of granulocyte colonystimulating factors for neutropenic infection, but the use
of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents was prohibited.
Blood counts and bone marrow biopsies were analyzed according to the International Working Group 2000
criteria.12 Blood counts were performed weekly for the first
2 cycles and every other week thereafter. Bone marrow aspirates and biopsies were performed as required, or at a minimum of every 16 weeks. Response to treatment was
classified according to International Working Group 2000
criteria12: complete response (CR) was investigatorassessed; partial response (PR) was investigator-assessed;
and major or minor hematological improvement was programmatically derived. Median time to first response was
evaluated from date of randomization, and median time
from first to best response was evaluated from the date of
the first response to best response. For these endpoints,
actual cycles were calculated by dividing the number of
days on treatment by 28 days, while excluding dose interruptions. Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion independence
was defined as the absence of RBC transfusions for 56
consecutive days during the treatment period. Median
times and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier13 methods stratified by International Prognostic Scoring System and
French-American-British classification. Median time to
RBC transfusion independence and the median duration
of RBC transfusion independence were analyzed using
patients who were transfusion dependent at baseline. All
analyses were performed using SAS 9.13.

RESULTS
Of the 179 patients who were assigned to azacitidine treatment, 91 (51%) achieved a response (CR, PR, or hematological improvement). The baseline characteristics of
these 91 responders are shown in Table 1. Median patient
age was 69 years (range, 42-83 years). Most patients were
male (78%) and had RAEB (66%), an ECOG performance status score of 0 to 1 (95%), and multiple cytopenias
(97%). In addition, 57 (63%) patients were RBC transfusion dependent at baseline.
Responding patients (those who achieved CR, PR,
or hematological improvement) received a median of 14
cycles of azacitidine (range, 2-30; Table 2). The median

28 days, 320 (27%) were 29 to 35 days, and 234 (19%)
were longer than 35 days. Cycle delays with azacitidine
occurred primarily because of the extended time necessary
for nadir and hematological recovery.
The median number of cycles to any first response
(CR, PR, or hematological improvement) was 2 (range, 116; Fig. 1); 1 patient achieved a first response of CR after

2 cycles of therapy. The median number of cycles to a first
response of PR (n ¼ 6) or hematological improvement (n
¼ 84) was 4 (range, 2-8) and 2 (range, 1-16), respectively.
Overall, 91% of responding patients achieved their first
response within 6 cycles. Of the remaining 9% of patients,
all achieved their first response by 12 cycles, except 1
patient who had first response at Cycle 16. Also of these
9% of patients, 1 achieved a PR and 7 a hematological
improvement, including 2 patients who later improved to
CR and PR, respectively. The first response achieved was
also the best response in 52% of patients. Of the remaining 48% of patients, continued azacitidine treatment after
initial response led to achievement of a higher response
category (Fig. 2). In these 48% of patients with an
improved response after a first response, the median number of additional cycles from first response to best
response was 3 (range, 1-11). By Cycle 12 of treatment
with azacitidine, 92% of responding patients had achieved
their best response. None of the 6 patients who achieved a
PR as the first response improved to CR; however, 44
(52%) of 84 patients who achieved a hematological
improvement as their first response went on to achieve either a CR or PR as their best response. Among 30 patients
who ultimately achieved a CR, median time from first to
best response was 3.5 cycles (95% CI, 3.0-6.0; Table 3).
In the 21 patients who achieved a best response of PR, the
median time from first to best response was 3.0 cycles
(95% CI, 1.0-3.0). After the maximum level of response
was achieved, azacitidine treatment was continued for a
median of 8 additional cycles (range, 0-27).
A total of 57 responders in this analysis were RBC
transfusion dependent at baseline (ie, had transfusions
during the 56 days before randomization). Of these, 88%
achieved RBC transfusion independence at some stage
during treatment with azacitidine. Median time to RBC
transfusion independence was 1.6 months (95% CI, 1.22.1), and the median duration of RBC transfusion independence was 13.0 months (95% CI, 7.2-20.9).

who achieved a response during treatment with azacitidine is shown.

Figure 2. Time to best response after first response in patients treated with azacitidine is shown. The vertical line on the y-axis
represents the 52% of patients whose first response was their best response. The remaining 48% of patients had an improvement
in their first response with continued azacitidine therapy; they all improved from a first response of hematological improvement
(HI) to either partial response (PR) or complete response (CR).

DISCUSSION
The purpose of this secondary analysis of the AZA001 trial was to provide a better understanding of the
timing and pattern of response to azacitidine therapy
in patients with higher-risk MDS. Considering that
91% of first responses occurred within 6 cycles, the
data from this study suggest that outcomes with azaci-

2700

tidine should be evaluated after a minimum of 6
cycles of treatment. In the remaining 9% of patients
with stable disease at 6 cycles, continued therapy
beyond 6 cycles resulted in achievement of a first
response.
This analysis shows that although most responses
occurred within 6 cycles, continued azacitidine therapy

led to a further improvement in response category in
almost half (48%) of all responders with a median of 3
additional cycles, and that 92% of patients achieved their
best response by Cycle 12. In a randomized phase 3 trial
conducted by the US Cancer and Leukemia Group B,
which compared azacitidine with best supportive care,
most responses occurred during the third or fourth month
of azacitidine therapy.7 A subsequent combined analysis
of 3 sequential azacitidine Cancer and Leukemia Group B
studies showed that first response to azacitidine occurred
after a median of 3 cycles.8 The phase 3 Cancer and Leukemia Group B study also showed that 90% of responses
occurred within the first 6 cycles of treatment and that
best response generally occurred 2 cycles after the first
response—all of which is consistent with the current findings. Taken together, these data suggest that although
some effects of azacitidine manifest promptly, additional
courses are usually necessary before best response is
achieved. Therefore, continuing azacitidine therapy offers
the best chance of enhanced benefit if treatment is tolerated and there is no evidence of disease progression.10
This information on the timing of responses should be
useful in monitoring the progress of a patient during
treatment.
Possible explanations for the observed pattern of
response to azacitidine may lie in its modulatory effects on
the MDS clone. The cytotoxic and hypomethylating
effects of azacitidine depend on the incorporation of its
metabolite into newly synthesized RNA and DNA.5,14-17
Multiple cell cycles may have to occur before sufficient
drug is incorporated to mediate sustained alterations in
gene expression.7,8 Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrate
a short plasma half-life for azacitidine, making it difficult
to explain how the rapid hypomethylating effect can occur
in cell populations where few cells are in cell cycle S-

phase.18 However, Gore et al9 showed that clinical
response to azacitidine in patients with MDS correlated
with pharmacokinetic measures of drug exposure and azacitidine-induced hypomethylation, providing some of the
first evidence to directly link the drug target effects of azacitidine with clinical outcomes. Moreover, after the first
cycle of treatment, they observed heterogeneous methylation of alleles in bone marrow cells and an incomplete
demethylation pattern in 3 responding patients. This observation suggests that azacitidine-induced hypomethylation occurs progressively within the MDS clone and that
maximal demethylation may require multiple exposures
to the drug.9 Furthermore, once azacitidine treatment is
stopped, aberrant promoter methylation and gene silencing return, suggesting that prolonged treatment will be
needed to maintain inhibition of DNA methylation.19
Although Fenaux et al3 demonstrated a major survival benefit with azacitidine compared with conventional
care regimens, the CR rates achieved with azacitidine in
this setting have been modest, leading to the hypothesis
that attainment of a CR is not essential for the survival
benefit observed with azacitidine.3,8,20,21 Improved survival has also been noted despite the persistence of the
MDS-associated cytogenetic clone or the emergence of
new abnormal cytogenetic clones in some patients.7,20
Therefore, azacitidine may affect the differentiation and
growth of the MDS clone without necessarily eradicating
it, suggesting that repetitive and prolonged exposure to
azacitidine may be necessary for both the initial effects
and the subsequent augmentation of response.
In summary, our findings demonstrate that,
although some MDS patients respond rapidly to azacitidine therapy (eg, in early treatment cycles), continued azacitidine therapy results in a qualitative increase in
response quality in almost half of the responders. These
data support the continued use of azacitidine in responding patients as long as the patient continues to benefit.
