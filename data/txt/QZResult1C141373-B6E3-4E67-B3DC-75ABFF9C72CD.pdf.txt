Abstract
TRAIL can induce apoptosis in some cancer cells and is an immune effector in the
surveillance and elimination of developing tumors. Yes, some cancers are resistant
to TRAIL. Delphinidin, a polyphenolic compound contained in brightly colored fruits
and vegetables, has anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-tumorigenic activities.
Here we showed that delphinidin sensitized TRAIL-resistant human prostate cancer
cells to undergo apoptosis. Cells treated with delphinidin and TRAIL activated the
extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of caspase activation. TRAIL-induced apoptosis in
prostate cancer cells pretreated with delphinidin was dependent on death receptor
5 (DR5) and downstream cleavage of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3). In conclusion,
delphinidin sensitizes prostate cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by inducing
DR5, thus causing caspase-mediated HDAC3 cleavage. Our data reveal a potential
way of chemoprevention of prostate cancer by enabling TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.

INTRODUCTION

later progresses to a large metastatic lesion [3]. However,
therapeutic strategies for this disease are limited because
chemotherapy and radiation therapy are largely ineffective,
and metastatic disease frequently develops even after
potentially curative surgery [4-6]. Therefore, developing a
novel therapeutic strategy for prostate cancer has become
an important medical need.
Tumor necrosis factor - related apoptosis - inducing
ligand (TRAIL) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor
(TNF) family of cytokines. TRAIL exerts proapoptotic
effects on malignant cells without any harmful effects to
normal cells. Endogenous TRAIL triggers death signaling
via receptor-mediated apoptosis through its interaction

Prostate cancer is one of the most frequently
diagnosed, non-cutaneous neoplasms in men and the
second leading cause of cancer-related mortality among
men in the United States. Prostate cancer is unique among
human cancers because of its striking age-dependent
incidence and variable penetrance. Genetic, epigenetic,
and environmental factors, including diet, also contribute
to the prostate carcinogenesis process [1, 2]. In other
words, the development of prostate cancer in humans
presents as a multistage process, involving a small latent
carcinoma of low histological grade at its onset, which

with these death receptors (DRs) on the surface of cancer
cells [7]. Five members of the death receptor family have
been identified that can bind TRAIL. The death receptors,
DR4 (TRAIL-R1) and DR5 (TRAIL-R2), contain both
two cysteine-rich extracellular TRAIL-binding domains
and a cytoplasmic death domain that are required for
transmitting a cytotoxic signal [8, 9]. The decoy receptors,
DcR1 (TRAIL-R3) and DcR2 (TRAIL-R4), also possess
binding ability for TRAIL, but they do not transmit
apoptotic signals due to a nonfunctional death domain [10,
11]. Finally, TRAIL initiates programmed cell death upon
binding to DR4 and/or DR5, which induces clustering
of the bound DRs (forming a microaggregate within the
cell membrane), and promotes the recruitment of the
adaptor molecule FADD (FAS-associated death domain).
This results in the formation of DISC (death inducing
signaling complex) and subsequent effector caspases.
TRAIL-mediated apoptosis can also be induced by the
intrinsic pathway, with the implication of mitochondrial
dysfunction, and the extrinsic pathway [12]. Caspase-8,
which contains a death effector domain, is activated by a
death receptor signaling pathway, and caspase-9, which
contains a caspase activation and recruitment domain
(CARD), is activated by a mitochondrial death signaling
pathway [13]. The link between the extrinsic and intrinsic
signaling pathways is formed by the BID (BH3-interacting
domain death agonist) protein, which is cleaved and
activated by caspase-8. Then, active caspase 8 cleaves
and directly activates downstream effector caspases (3, 6
and 7), which ultimately cut vital cellular substrates and
cause apoptosis [14, 15]. BCL-2 family proteins, which
comprise both anti-apoptotic members such as BCL-2 and
MCL-1 and pro-apoptotic molecules such as BAX, play
an important role in the regulation of the mitochondrial
apoptotic pathway [16]. TRAIL treatment results in upregulation of DR5 expression, activation of caspase-8
and BID, leading to BAX conformational changes and
translocation to the mitochondria. This, in turn, causes a
loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and release of
cytochrome c into the cytoplasm, followed by activation
of caspase-3, and induction of caspase-dependent
apoptosis [17]. Inhibitor of Apoptosis proteins (IAPs)
can block executioner caspases. Specifically, XIAP and
survivin are potent inhibitors of caspase 9, while cIAP-2
and XIAP can inhibit caspases 3 and 7 [18, 19]. p53 can
act in both the extrinsic pathway to up-regulated TRAIL
receptors directly in a p53-dependent manner or to activate
pro-apoptotic elements, such as BAX through the intrinsic
apoptotic pathway [20]. More recently, enhancement of
p53 acetylation levels strongly correlates with protein
stabilization and activation in response to cellular stress
and is indispensable for p53 transcriptional activity [21,
22].
However, some tumor cells - including prostate
cancer and gliomas - are resistant to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis [23-26]. Failure to undergo apoptosis has been
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

implicated in the resistance of cancer cells to TRAIL
surveillance, and, therefore, in tumor development
[14]. In addition, an obstacle to effective therapy is that
prostate cancer, similar to many other cancers, develops
resistance to TRAIL [27-29]. Thus, researchers are
currently seeking to identify TRAIL sensitizers which is
capable of overcoming TRAIL resistance in cancer cells.
Novel agents, such as natural compounds, are needed
to overcome this resistance and to improve TRAIL
efficacy. Recently, a variety of agents, such as various
types of isoflavones [30], ursolic acid [31], carnitine [32],
salirasib [33], monensin [34], and 2-tellurium-bridged
β-cyclodextrin [35], have been reported to sensitize tumors
to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Recently, cancer prevention
research reports have shown that chemopreventive agents,
such as curcumin, EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate), and
resveratrol, have the therapeutic potential to sensitize
prostate cancer cells to TRAIL [36-38]. In this study, we
examined this hypothesis to determine whether delphinidin
enhances the therapeutic potential of TRAIL and induces
apoptosis of TRAIL-resistant prostate cancer LNCaP cells.
Furthermore, resistance to TRAIL is an important
therapeutic problem that may be resolved by combination
treatments, but it act by various mechanisms, including
the restoration of caspase-8 expression or decrease in
c-FLIP levels [39, 40]. Because most agents used in
such combinations are inherently toxic, it is imperative
to find nontoxic agents, such as HDAC inhibitors
(HDACi), which have recently entered clinical trials and
exert their antitumor effects by inducing growth arrest,
differentiation, and apoptosis [41-44]. To date, eighteen
distinct HDACs have been identified and classified into
four groups based on their structural divergence, namely,
class I, II, III, and IV HDACs [45, 46]. There are three
classes of mammalian HDAC enzymes, class I comprising
HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8; class II HDACs
comprising HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC6, HDAC7,
HDAC9, and HDAC10; and a third class of NADdependent SIR2 deacetylases [43-45]. These HDACs
are involved in modulating most key cellular processes,
including apoptosis, autophagy, transcriptional regulation,
metabolism, DNA damage repair, cell cycle control,
senescence, and chaperone function [47]. However,
HDACs have been found to function incorrectly in cancer.
Therefore, HDAC inhibition by an HDAC inhibitor or by
HDAC cleavage has been explored as a chemotherapeutic
strategy to interfere with aberrant HDAC activity in
human cancers. Several studies have demonstrated that a
combination strategy of an HDAC inhibitor with a TRAIL
sensitizer has emerged as a potent strategy to prime cancer
cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in a variety of human
cancers [48]. Recently, HDAC cleavage has been shown to
play an important role in apoptosis in response to various
cellular stimuli. For example, the apoptosis induced by
cleaved HDAC3 or enhanced by c-JUN deficiency during
osmotic stress is suppressed by exogenous expression of
9971

c-JUN, indicating that the down-regulation of c-JUN by
HDAC3-dependent transcriptional repression plays a role
in regulating cell survival and apoptosis [49]. Caspasedependent HDAC3 degradation, which is involved in the
regulation of E2F-1 transcription, has also been observed
in neuronal apoptosis [50]. Notably, Fabrice E and
colleagues demonstrated the role of HDAC3 in apoptosis
control. They showed that C-terminal cleavage of HDAC3
is caspase dependent and accumulates in the cytoplasm.
The cleavage and cytoplasm re-localization of HDAC3
caused by apoptosis stimuli induces apoptosis of cells via
the activation of proapoptotic genes and the inhibition
of anti-apoptotic genes [51]. Thus, cleaved HDAC3 is
indispensable for inducing cell apoptosis.
Anthocyanins are naturally occurring flavonoids
that are responsible for the bright colors of many fruits
and vegetables. Anthocyanins are organic compounds,
which are derivatives of the glycosylation of aglycon
anthocyanidin, and more than 500 kinds of compounds,
with differences in the number of added sugars, are
estimated to exist. As representatives of anthocyanidins,
delphinidin, pelargonidin, cyanidin, and malvidin are
naturally occurring [52-54]. Delphinidin, one of the major
anthocyanidins present in these fruits and vegetables, is
a diphenylpropane-based polyphenolic ring structure
that carries a positive charge on its central ring [55].
Delphinidin possesses anti-oxidant [56], anti-inflammatory
[57], anti-angiogenic [58] and anti-mutagenic activity
[59], and was recently reported to inhibit invasion of
breast cancer cells [60]. Other studies have revealed
that delphinidin inhibits proliferation and induces
apoptosis in many different cancer models including
colon, uterine, breast, and prostate [61-64]. However, dd
effects of delphinidin on TRAIL-induced apoptosis and
the underlying molecular mechanisms for those effects in
prostate cancer cells.
In this study, we demonstrated that delphinidin
potently sensitized human prostate cancer cells to TRAILmediated apoptosis via DR5 induction and the caspasedependent pathway. Furthermore, we showed for the first
time that cleavage of HDAC3 had a critical role in this
caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway on TRAIL-induced
apoptosis in the presence of delphinidin. Therefore, The
combination delphinidin with TRAIL could be attractive
strategy for the treatment of TRAIL-resistant prostate
cancer.

assay and western blot analysis to assess PARP cleavage,
we confirmed this differential sensitivity to the antiproliferative effects and apoptosis in a dose- and timedependent manner, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1B and
1C, TRAIL treatment for 12 h LNCaP cells were refractory
to a TRAIL-induced anti-proliferative effect to a dose as
high as 100 ng/ml, while treatments with 50 ng/ml TRAIL
resulted in approximately 50% inhibition of cell growth in
Du145 cells. Apoptosis was activated in both LNCap and
Du145 cells upon treatment with 150 ng/ml and 50 ng/
ml of TRAIL for 12 h, respectively, as confirmed by the
results for PARP cleavage (Fig. 1D).
We first measured the effect of delphinidin on cell
viability and PARP cleavage using western blot analysis
in human prostate cancer cell lines. We examined whether
delphinidin induced apoptosis in LNCaP and Du145 cells.
Cells were treated with various low-dose concentrations
(0-90 μM) of delphinidin for 12 h. We then observed that
low-dose delphinidin did not inhibit cell viability (Fig.
2A) and PARP cleavage (Fig. 2B) in LNCaP and Du145
cells, respectively. Next, we examined the effect on cell
viability and PARP cleavage of combining delphinidin
(0-30 μM) with 50 ng/ml TRAIL. Delphinidin strongly
synergized with TRAIL to induce an anti-proliferative
effect in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). As shown
in Fig. 2D, in TRAIL-resistant LNCaP cells no cleavage
of PARP occurred upon treatment with 50 ng/ml TRAIL
alone, but TRAIL treatment cleaved PARP in the presence
of 10 μM delphinidin. In contrast, in TRAIL-sensitive
Du145 cells PARP cleavage was induced by TRAIL
treatment even in the absence of delphinidin. To further
investigate the anti-proliferative and proapoptotic effects
of delphinidin, we examined whether delphinidin could
sensitize LNCaP and Du145 cells to TRAIL-mediated
cell growth inhibition and to induce apoptosis. LNCaP
and Du145 cells were treated for 12 h with delphinidin
(30 μM) along with various concentrations of TRAIL.
Figure 2E shows that after 12 h delphinidin treatment
synergistically sensitized the anti-proliferative effect in
response to TRAIL. The co-treatment with delphinidin
(30 μM) and various concentrations of TRAIL similarly
induced PARP cleavage in TRAIL-sensitive Du145
cells and TRAIL-resistant LNCaP cells (Fig. 2F). These
results suggest that delphinidin increases the apoptotic
ability of TRAIL in prostate cancer cells. In subsequent
experiments, we used TRAIL-resistant LNCaP cells to
reveal the delphinidin-induced sensitization mechanisms
of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.

resistant LNCaP cells, apoptotic cell death and nuclear
fragmentation/shrinkage was monitored by cell
morphology and DAPI staining. As shown in Fig. 3A, the
morphology of LNCaP cells was significantly altered by
the combination of TRAIL with delphinidin, but not by
either individual treatment. The nuclear morphology in
DAPI-stained cells was destroyed during TRAIL-mediated
apoptosis in the presence of delphinidin (Fig. 3B).
To further explore the apoptosis-inducing
mechanism, we examined the activation and expression
of caspase proteins. Preferentially, to determine whether
combined treatment with delphinidin and TRAIL induces
caspase-dependent apoptosis, LNCaP cells were incubated
for 12 h with 50 ng/ml TRAIL and 30 µM delphinidin
in the presence or absence of zVAD, a general caspase

inhibitor. As shown in Figure 3C, treatment with zVAD
remarkably reduced the ability of delphinidin to sensitize
LNCaP cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. As expected
from the zVAD antagonism, co-treatment with TRAIL and
delphinidin induced a significant cleavage of caspase-3
and caspase-7 on western blot analysis (Fig. 3D). The
levels of cleaved initiator caspase-8 and caspase-9 were
enhanced by co-treatment with TRAIL and delphinidin,
and were completely inhibited by zVAD (Fig. 3D). As
shown in Fig. 3E-G, treatment with zVAD dramatically
repressed the activity of caspase-3/7, caspase-8 and
caspase-9 in LNCaP cells and attenuated the sensitization
induced by the combined treatment with TRAIL and
delphinidin.

caspase-8, caspase-9, and cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-7 were reduced by zVAD treatment on western blot analysis (D). (E-G) TRAIL
and delphinidin dramatically induced activation of caspases in LNCaP cells. LNCaP cells were pretreated for 30 min with or without zVAD

and caspase-9 were inhibited by zVAD treatment. All data are expressed as the mean ± SD for triplicates (*P<0.05 vs. -TRAIL/-DEL;

TRAIL-induced apoptosis in cells pretreated
with delphinidin involves both the DR5 and the
intrinsic apoptotic pathways

TRAIL-induced apoptosis by delphinidin. Co-treatment of
LNCaP cells with delphinidin and TRAIL resulted in the
up-regulation of BAX expression, and siRNA-mediated
knock-down of BAX markedly inhibited delphinidinstimulated TRAIL-induced caspase-3 activation (Fig.
4B, bottom). Because the combined treatment with
TRAIL and delphinidin leads to the modulation of
BCL-2 family proteins related to the intrinsic apoptotic
pathway - including the IAPs, MCL-1, and p21 - we
evaluated the mRNA expression of these proteins in
LNCaP cells. As shown in Fig. 4D, co-treatment resulted
in the up-regulation of BAX and p21 as well as DR5 in
LNCaP cells; whereas, it significantly reduced the mRNA
expression level of XIAP, cIAP-2, Bcl-2, survivin and
MCL-1.

Because DR5 on the cell surface trigger apoptosis
dependent on TRAIL binding, we investigated whether
delphinidin induced DR5 protein expression in a dosedependent manner in LNCaP and Du145 cells. As
shown in Fig. 4A, delphinidin treatment up-regulated
the expression of DR5 protein in a dose-dependent
manner, siRNA-mediated suppression of DR5 effectively
blocked delphinidin-stimulated TRAIL-induced caspase-3
activation (Fig. 4B, upper) and apoptosis (Fig. 4C).
Next, we investigated whether the modulation of BAX
proteins is involved in the sensitization of LNCaP cells to

in LNCaP and Du145 cells. LNCaP and Du145 cells were treated for 12 h with different concentration of delphinidin (0, 10, 30, 50 µM),
and western blot analysis was performed using antibodies against DR5. (B and C) DR5 and BAX expression is critical for the sensitization
of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. LNCaP cells transfected with the scrambled siRNA, DR5 siRNA, or BAX siRNA were further treated with
30 μM delphinidin and 50 ng/ml TRAIL for 12 h. (B) Western blot analysis demonstrated inhibition of caspase-3 cleavage by knockdown of
DR5 or BAX and (C) their corresponding antiapoptotic effects. The apoptotic cell death was determined by MTT assay (left) and TUNEL
assay (right) kit as described in Materials and Methods. (D) Co-treatment of delphinidin and TRAIL regulates the expression of various
apoptosis-related genes at transcriptional level. LNCaP cells were treated with TRAIL (T, 50 ng/ml) and/or delphinidin (D, 30 µM) for 12 h.
The expression level of each gene was analyzed by qRT-PCR using total mRNA from LNCaP cells, treated with delphinidin and/or TRAIL,
and compared with control LNCaP cells. Fold-change was calculated by 2--△△Ct relative quantitative analysis. The data are expressed as the
mean ± SD for triplicates (*P<0.05 vs. -TRAIL/-DEL).

TRAIL. HDAC3 activity (Fig. 5C) was also reduced
by co-treatment with TRAIL and delphinidin. In the
combined treatment with delphinidin and TRAIL, siRNAmediated suppression of HDAC3 more effectively blocked
the expression of survivin, BCL-2, XIAP, BID, and cIAP2, and increased the expression of BAX compared with
siRNA HDAC3 alone (Fig. 5D). Also, interestingly, the
levels of acetylated p53 and total p53 increased more
markedly in the combined treatment with delphinidin and
TRAIL compared with either alone Fig. 5D. Conversely,
exogenously expressed HDAC3 increased the expression
of antiapoptotic factors survivin, BCL-2, XIAP, BID and
cIAP-2 in a dose-dependent fashion, and remarkably
decreased the expression of proapoptotic factors BAX, p53

and acetylated p53, antagonizing the negative and positive
effects of the delphinidin plus TRAIL combination (Fig.
5E). Additionally, combined treatment with TRAIL and
delphinidin led to apoptosis and cleavage of HDAC3 in
TRAIL-resistant LNCaP cells as well as TRAIL-sensitive
Du145 cells (Fig. 5F and 5G). Taken together, these results
demonstrate that the cleavage of HDAC3 contributes to
the sensitizing effect of delphinidin on TRAIL-mediated
apoptosis, which involves the regulation of mitochondrial
proteins, IAPs, p53, and acetylated p53.

HDAC3 cleavage is regulated by DR5-mediated
effector caspases activation and accelerated the
delphinidin-induced sensitization of TRAILmediated apoptosis

activity. This finding suggests that prostate cancer cells are
capable of amplifying apoptotic signaling initiated by DR’s
through the recruitment of the mitochondrial pathway, as
observed in other cell types. Given that TRAIL is known
to trigger apoptosis through binding to its cell surface
death receptors, DR4 and DR5, the expression levels of
these death receptors may be critical to determining the
intensity and/or duration of TRAIL-induced apoptotic
signaling [8, 9, 66]. We recently showed that the DR5
up-regulating agent, neobavaisoflavone, effectively
stimulates TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in prostate cancer
cells via the intrinsic pathway [67]. In this study, we find
that delphinidin increases the protein level of DR5 in
prostate cancer cells. A siRNA-mediated DR5 knockdown
effectively inhibits the apoptosis induced by delphinidin
plus TRAIL, confirming the functional significance of
DR5 up-regulation in delphinidin-stimulated TRAILmediated apoptosis. In addition, combined treatment
with delphinidin and TRAIL transcriptionally regulates
expression of anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic molecules
as well as DR5. Notably, co-treatment with delphinidin
and TRAIL significantly reduced the mRNA expression
level of MCL-1, XIAP and cIAP-2. Human MCL-1 is an
anti-apoptotic member of the BCL-2 protein family with
similar BH (BCL-2 homology)-multidomain structures
as BCL-2 and BCL-XL [16, 68]. Recently, it has been
reported that increased MCL-1 expression likely confers
additional protection against tBID in TRAIL-treated BAXdeficient cells [19]. It follows that in cells with elevated
MCL-1 expression, tBID is bound by MCL-1 [69],
and all of tBID’s proapoptotic activities are inhibited.
Thus, we speculate that down-regulation of MCL-1
by delphinidin plus TRAIL might play a critical role in
delphinidin-stimulated TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Also,
the potent inhibitors of caspases, XIAP, cIAP-2, and
survivin, are down-regulated by delphinidin plus TRAIL.
Furthermore, it is reported that salirasib, an S-farnesyl
cysteine analog, reduces survivin mRNA expression
in human hepatocarcinoma cell lines, and protein
expression of survivin markedly decreases after 48 h of
treatment with 150 mM of salirasib, coinciding with the
beginning of TRAIL sensitization. It is therefore tempting
to speculate that salirasib-induced inhibition of survivin
has an important role in this process [33]. Therefore, our
data suggest that sensitization of LNCaP cells to TRAILinduced apoptosis by delphinidin occurs through DR5 upregulation and caspase-dependent mitochondrial pathways
(Fig. 6D).
HDAC3 is an important component of nuclear
receptor co-repressor (N-CoR)-silencing mediator for
retinoid and thyroid receptor (SMRT) co-repressor
complexes that include G protein suppressor pathway
2 (GPS2), transducin β-like 1 (TBL1), and transducin
β-like X-linked receptor 1 (TBLR1) [70]. We find that
cleavage of HDAC3 contributes to the sensitizing effect
of delphinidin on TRAIL-mediated apoptosis involving

As shown in Fig. 6A, in the combined treatment
with delphinidin and TRAIL DR5 siRNA more effectively
inhibited the activation of effector caspases (caspase-3
and -7) and the cleavage of HDAC3 compared with the
scrambled siRNA. Therefore, this result demonstrated
that activity of effector caspases and HDAC3 cleavage
is altered by DR5, which plays a critical role in the
delphinidin-induced sensitization of TRAIL-mediated
apoptosis. Because HDAC3 is caspase-dependent in some
cell types, we examined the possible involvement of active
effector caspases in HDAC3 cleavage. Pretreatment with
the caspase 3/7 inhibitor DQMD inhibited the delphinidin
and TRAIL-induced activation of caspase 3/7 and
remarkably blocked truncation of HDAC3 (Fig. 6B),
suggesting that HDAC3 is cleaved by effector caspases
during co-treatment. DNA fragmentation represents a
characteristic hallmark of apoptosis. TUNEL assay is
an established method for detecting DNA fragments. To
investigate whether combined treatment of delphinidin
and TRAIL can induce apoptotic cell death through
HDAC3, TUNEL staining was performed. As shown in
Fig. 6C, apoptotic cell death by delphinidin and TRAIL
combination treatment was significantly increased by
HDAC3 siRNA (3.5-fold) compared with the scrambled
siRNA (2.1-fold), suggesting that cleavage of HDAC3
accelerates the sensitizing effect of delphinidin on TRAILmediated apoptosis.

DISCUSSION
TRAIL, also known as APO2L, is a member of the
TNF family of death receptor ligands and has significant
potential for use in cancer therapy because of its potent
ability to selectively kill cancer cells while leaving
normal cells unharmed [65]. The selectivity of TRAIL
to trigger apoptosis in cancer cells has led to the clinical
development of recombinant TRAIL and TRAIL-receptor
agonists as an anticancer therapy. TRAIL-based therapies
are now in Phase I and II clinical trials (www.clinicaltrials.
gov). However, TRAIL will probably not be viable as a
single agent since the majority of tumor cells are resistant
to TRAIL. Combination therapy (with chemotherapy
or radiation) is therefore essential for the use of TRAIL
against refractory tumors.
In our current report, we find for the first time
that delphinidin, a major anthocyanidin, is capable of
sensitizing highly resistant prostate cancer cells to TRAILmediated apoptosis. Caspase-dependent pathways of
apoptosis are involved in this process, as evidenced by a
strong induction of caspase-3/7, caspase-8 and caspase-9

the regulation of mitochondrial proteins. HDAC3 is
cleaved, and cleaved HDAC3 localizes to the cytoplasm
and can no longer deacetylate histones on the promoters
of its proapoptotic targets upon apoptosis induction.
Histones on these promoters can become hyperacetylated,
thereby allowing the transcriptional activation of these
proapoptotic genes and cell progression into apoptosis
[51]. Truncated HDAC3, which is generated by caspase-7
cleavage during the early phase of osmotic stress, binds
to the c-JUN promoter region in a c-JUN-dependent
manner, deacetylates histones, and thereby represses
c-JUN transcription. The abrogated c-JUN expression,
which down-regulates c-JUN activation occurring during
the early stage of exposure to stress, promotes osmotic
stimulation-induced cell apoptosis [49]. Thus, we
speculate that delphinidin-stimulated TRAIL-mediated
apoptosis is accelerated by the transcriptional activation of
proapoptotic genes via cleavage of HDAC3. In addition,
we reveal that co-treatment with delphinidin and TRAIL
induces DR5 up-regulation and downstream cleavage of
HDAC3 by effector caspases. Similar to the repression
of c-JUN by cleaved HDAC3, HDAC4 is cleaved in
a caspase-3-dependent manner [71, 72], causing the
N-terminal fragment of HDAC4 to translocate into the
nucleus and to represses transcription of myocyte enhancer
factor-2C (MEF2C) [72]. We believe that the consistency
of mechanistic action supports our model suggesting
that HDAC3 cleavage by the effector caspases critically
contributes to delphinidin-facilitated TRAIL-mediated
apoptosis.
In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that
a combination of delphinidin and TRAIL can effectively
induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Also, we find
that delphinidin-mediated TRAIL sensitization in prostate
cancer cells seem to be associated with activation of
effector caspases via induction of the DR5 pathway,
leading to HDAC3 cleavage-dependent mitochondrial
apoptosis. Therefore, our study provides a possible
therapeutic application of delphinidin and TRAIL for
treatment of prostate cancers that are resistant to TRAIL.
