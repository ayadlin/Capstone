Skin Tumorigenesis Stimulated by Raf Inhibitors Relies Upon
Raf Functions That Are Dependent and Independent of ERK
Eszter Doma, Christian Rupp, Andrea Varga, Florian Kern, Bettina Riegler, and Manuela Baccarini

Abstract
RAF inhibitors achieve unprecedented but mainly transient clinical responses in patients with melanoma
whose tumors harbor an activating BRAF mutation. One notable side-effect of RAF inhibitors is the stimulation of
cutaneous skin tumors, arising in about 30% of patients receiving these drugs, which are thought to develop as a
result of inhibitor-induced activation of wild-type Raf in occult precursor skin lesions. This effect raises the
possibility that less manageable tumors might also arise in other epithelial tissues. Here we provide preclinical
evidence supporting this disquieting hypothesis by showing that the RAF inhibitors PLX-4032 (vemurafenib) and
GDC-0879 precipitate the development of cell-autonomous, Ras-driven tumors in skin and gastric epithelia. The
magnitude of the effects correlated with the inhibitors' relative abilities to induce ERK activation. Epidermisrestricted ablation of either B-Raf or C-Raf prevented PLX-4032–induced ERK activation and tumorigenesis. In
contrast, GDC-0879 induced ERK activation and tumorigenesis in B-Raf–deﬁcient epidermis, whereas C-Raf
ablation blocked GDC-0879–induced tumorigenesis (despite strong ERK activation) by preventing Roka–
mediated keratinocyte dedifferentiation. Thus, inhibitor-induced ERK activation did not require a speciﬁc Raf
kinase. ERK activation was necessary, but not sufﬁcient for Ras þ Raf inhibitor-induced tumorigenesis, whereas
C-Raf downregulation of Roka was essential even in the face of sustained ERK signaling to prevent differentiation
and promote tumorigenesis. Taken together, our ﬁndings suggest that combination therapies targeting ERKdependent and -independent functions of Raf may be more efﬁcient but also safer for cancer treatment. Cancer

Introduction
RAF inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic patients with melanoma whose cancers harbor the
BRAF mutation V600E, which increases kinase activity and
leads to the constitutive activation of the MEK/ERK pathway
(1–3). The side effects of the drugs are mild but include the
development, in up to 30% of the patients, of keratoacanthomas or cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cSCC). In
cultured cells, Raf inhibitors can paradoxically stimulate Raf
kinase activity and MEK/ERK activation, particularly in the
presence of activated Ras. The precise mechanism of action of
the Raf inhibitors is yet unclear; activation/dimerization
induced by the direct binding of the drugs to the Raf kinase
domain (4, 5), relief of autoinhibitory P-loop phosphorylation
(6), and a more complex mechanism involving reactivation of
desensitized B-Raf (7) have been proposed to explain inhibitor-induced ERK activation. Inhibitor-induced ERK activa-

tion could potentially account for the development of therapy-related tumors in the patients with melanoma. These
tumor harbor Ras mutations with variably increased frequency (from 17% to 60% in different studies; refs. 8–10). In
addition, inhibitor treatment accelerates tumor development
in a mouse model of chemical skin carcinogenesis (8), which
partially depends on H-Ras and involves a strong inﬂammatory response (11). It is thus yet unclear whether Ras activation, in the absence of other mutations or of inﬂammation, is
enough to license Raf inhibitor-driven tumorigenesis and
whether B-Raf or C-Raf (Raf-1) is essential for the development of drug-induced epithelial tumors.
To test the effect of Raf inhibitors on tumor-prone epidermis, we used a transgenic mouse model in which the expression of a dominant active, farnesylated Son of Sevenless (SOS-F)
in keratin 5 positive basal keratinocytes leads to the development of epidermal tumors (K5-SOS-F transgenic mice; ref. 12).
This system has the advantage of being cell autonomous and
not dependent on inﬂammation, which is absolutely necessary
to support the growth of chemically induced skin tumors (11).
These 2 features allow us to focus on the effect of the inhibitors
on the signaling operating in premalignant cells, reducing the
impact of other cell compartments (inﬂammatory cells) supporting tumorigenesis. In addition, the transgenic model
mimics the situation of spontaneous human cSCC, in that it
induces Ras and Erk activation in the absence of somatic Ras
mutations (13), which are comparatively rare event in drugrelated tumors (9).

Raf Inhibitors and Skin Carcinogenesis

Materials and Methods
Mouse strains and inhibitor treatment
Mouse strains and genotyping have been previously
described (14). Strains were maintained on a 129Sv/Bl6 (F1)
background. Animal experiments were authorized by the
Austrian Ministry of Science and Communications, following
the approval by the Ethical Committee for Animal Experimentation. GDC-0879, PLX-4032, synthesized and formulated
according to published procedures (WO2006/084015 and
WO2007/002325), and, in selected experiments GSK1120212
(trametinib) and Y-27632 were applied daily by gavage (100
mg/kg GDC-0879 in 0.5% Natrosol, citric acid pH 3.0; 100 mg/kg
PLX-4032, high-bioavailability formulation in 5% Klucel, HCl
pH 3.2, WO2010/114928; 0.5 mg/kg GSK1120212 in DMSO/1%
Natrosol; 2  15 mg/kg Y-27632 in 0.5% Klucel). The Rok
inhibitor Fasudil was added to the drinking water (exchanged
every 3–4 days) at a concentration of 2 mg/mL.
Histological analysis
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemistry were performed as described (14). For BrdU
incorporation, mice were injected with BrdU (12.5 mg/g body
weight) 1 hour before tissue isolation.
Cell culture
Mouse keratinocytes were isolated and maintained as
described (14). HaCaT cells (15) were obtained from the DKFZ
and SCC cell lines (16) were kindly provided by Gian-Paolo
Dotto and maintained as previously described (16). COS7 cells
were bought from Genlantis and maintained according to the
manufacturer's instruction. The cell lines were not authenticated in our lab but were used shortly after resuscitation of
early passages (<5) of the original material received from the
provider. A total of 70% conﬂuent cells were treated with
inhibitors for 1 hour at 32 C or at 37 C for the COS7 cells.
Site-directed mutagenesis
Point mutation was introduced with the QuickChange SiteDirected Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) using pcDNA FLAGtagged C-Raf as a template and the primers 50 -gtggctgttctgcgcaaaacacaccatgtgaacattctg-30 (forward) and 50 -cagaatgttcacatggtgtgttttgcgcagaacagccac-30 (reverse). The mutation was
veriﬁed by sequencing.
Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation
For ex vivo immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation, keratinocytes were prepared as previously described (17), but
instead of plating the cells were subjected to differential
centrifugation to enrich for speciﬁc epidermal layers. The
K5þ/K10þ layers were pooled and processed further for
immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. Cultured cells or
epidermis were lysed with Laemmli buffer at 95 C for 5
minutes. Lysates were immunoblotted using the following
primary antibodies (1:1000): a-A-Raf, a-B-Raf, and a-pCoﬁlin
(Santa Cruz); a-C-Raf and a-SOS (BD Biosciences); a-pMEK,
a-tMEK, a-pERK, and a-panERK (Cell Signaling); a-Coﬁlin,
pRSK, pELK, cyclin D1, and cFos (Abcam); a-GAPDH (Millipore) and FLAG (Bethyl). Immunoprecipitation was performed

www.aacrjournals.org

as previously described (18) using a-B-Raf (Santa Cruz),
a-C-Raf (Cell Signaling), or Roka antibodies (BD Biosciences)
coupled to ProteinG-Sepharose beads (Invitrogen). Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged C-Raf was carried out using AntiFLAG M2 afﬁnity gel (Sigma-Aldrich).
Ras activation assay
Ras-GTP was pulled down from keratinocyte lysates using
immobilized C-Raf RBD according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Cytoskeleton Inc.).
Statistical analysis
Values are expressed as mean (SD) of at least 3 independent experiments. P values were calculated using the 2-tailed
Student t test. A P value <0.05 is considered statistically
signiﬁcant.

Results
We have treated the K5-SOS-F transgenic mice with 2
selective Raf inhibitors: PLX-4032 (vemurafenib; refs. 1–
3, 19), currently used in the clinical treatment of melanoma;
and GDC-0879 (20, 21), which is not used in the clinic but has
higher afﬁnity for Raf and reportedly increases proliferation in
mouse epidermis (5). The estimated IC50 values of the inhibitors at 1 mmol/L ATP concentration are similar for wild-type
B-Raf and C-Raf; in both cases, GDC-0879 is more potent with
an IC50 of 34 or 180 nmol/L against B- or C-Raf, respectively,
compared with the 530 and 1100 nmol/L IC50 of the tool
compound PLX-4720, the precursor of PLX-4032 (5). The
inhibitors, applied daily by gavage, could be detected in mouse
plasma (Fig. 1A); in particular, the plasma exposures to PLX4032 were comparable to those necessary to achieve melanoma
regression in patients (1, 2). Both drugs caused a range of skin
phenotypes in K5-SOS-F transgenics, including the growth of
preexisting tumors and the thickening of the epidermis of tail,
eyelids, and ears (Fig. 1B and C). These phenotypes were
already evident after 5 to 7 days of inhibitor treatment. The
mice rapidly lost weight (around 20% in 1 week; Fig. 1D) and
had to be euthanized. Necropsy revealed papilloma development in the squamous epithelia of esophagus and forestomach
in 13 of 13 animals/inhibitor (Fig. 1E), likely causing weight loss
and death. These epithelia express K5, but they do not develop
tumors in the absence of inhibitor treatment. All phenotypes
were most marked in GDC-0879-treated animals and correlated with an increase in proliferation (% BrdUþ cells) and a
decrease in differentiation (% of epidermal layers positive for
K10, expressed by suprabasal keratinocytes) in the affected
tissues, and with a strong increase in ERK phosphorylation
(Fig. 2A–C). Neither inhibitor caused tumor development,
toxicity, or any other overt adverse effects in WT mice, indicating that the phenotypes depended on concomitant Ras
activation. Some thickening of the tail, accompanied by
increased ERK phosphorylation and proliferation but not by
dedifferentiation, could be observed at late time points in
GDC-0879–treated WT animals (Supplementary Fig. S1). ERK
activation in vivo was paralleled by MEK/ERK activation in
cultured wild type and K5-SOS-Fþ premalignant mouse keratinocytes treated with low concentrations of the inhibitors,

portantly, heterodimerization could be clearly detected in
epidermal lysates of inhibitor-treated animals (Fig. 3C and
D). GDC-0879 was more effective than PLX-4032 in inducing
ex vivo MEK/ERK activation and Raf heterodimerization, in
good correlation with the more pronounced effects achieved
in vivo at lower GDC-0879 plasma exposures (Fig. 1A).

Importantly, the MEK inhibitor trametinib reduced both Ras
and RasþRaf inhibitor-induced tail tumor formation, indicating that activation of the ERK pathway is necessary for this
process (Supplementary Fig. S3).
The existing literature predominantly indicates that
inhibitor-induced ERK activation in cultured cells depends
on C-Raf (4, 5, 7). Raf inhibitors might simply induce
conformational changes that promote the folding of the
Raf kinase domain and therefore dimerization (4, 5), or
preclude autoinhibitory P-loop phosphorylation (6). Alternatively, there might be a more complex mode of action,
involving the inhibition of B-Raf activity and release of
inactive B-Raf from a cytosolic complex, which, in Rastransformed cells, leads to B-Raf plasma membrane localization and formation of a Ras/B-Raf/C-Raf complex (7). To
investigate which of these models is operating in vivo during
Ras- and Raf inhibitor-driven tumorigenesis, we combined

the K5-SOS-F transgenic mice with epidermis-restricted
B-Raf or C-Raf ablation (K5-SOS-F;b-rafKOep and K5-SOSF;c-rafKOep, knockout in the epidermis). Using these mice,
we have previously demonstrated that both the development and the maintenance of Ras-driven tumors absolutely
require the presence of C-Raf, not as an Erk activator but
rather as an endogenous inhibitor of the cytoskeleton-based
kinase Roka (Rock2), which induces keratinocyte differentiation (14). The effect of B-Raf ablation is milder, but it still
leads to an impressive reduction of tumor number and size
that correlates with reduced ERK activation in the epidermis (22). Both K5-SOS-F;c-rafKOep and K5-SOS-F;b-rafKOep
mice were more resistant to treatment with Raf inhibitors.
Neither strain experienced dramatic weight loss or death.
Epidermis-restricted B-Raf or C-Raf ablation protected
K5-SOS-Fþ animals from the effects of PLX-4032 (Supplementary Fig. S4). However, treatment with GDC-0879, a

Raf Inhibitors and Skin Carcinogenesis

Spontaneous regression of therapy-related cutaneous SCC
upon discontinuation of inhibitor treatment has been
observed in the clinic (9). In the K5-SOS-F transgenic mice
treated with PLX-4032 (clinically relevant situation), tail
tumors continued to develop after inhibitor treatment
stopped (Supplementary Fig. S6A). This result was expected
because the SOS-F transgene can drive the tumors independently of inhibitor treatment. However, the mice regained
some weight (Supplementary Fig. S6B) and the thickening of
the esophageal epithelia brought about by the Raf inhibitor
stopped (Supplementary Fig. S6B). In addition, the interruption of GDC-0879 treatment, which induces tail tumors in

more potent Raf activator, induced the development, albeit
delayed, of large tail tumors in 8 of 8 K5-SOS-F;b-rafKOep
mice (Fig. 4A and B). Thus, B-Raf is required for Ras-induced
tumorigenesis (22), and speciﬁcally tumorigenesis induced
by Ras þ PLX-4032, but this requirement is alleviated by
treatment with GDC-0879. In contrast, 22 of 22 K5-SOS-F;
c-rafKOep mice were resistant to GDC-0879 treatment and
merely showed moderate thickening of the tail epidermis
and lengthening of claws (Fig. 4A and B and Supplementary
Fig. S5A). Importantly, Ras is activated at similar levels in
K5-SOS-F, K5-SOSF;c-rafKOep, and K5-SOS-F;b-rafKOep primary keratinocytes (Fig. 4C).

induced gene products (cFos, cyclin D1) in the epidermis
of vehicle- or inhibitor-treated K5-SOS-F;c-rafKOep and K5SOS-F;b-rafKOep mice (Fig. 5). In all cases, GDC-0879–
induced ERK downstream signaling was activated at comparable levels in the B- and C-Raf–deﬁcient epidermis. To
obtain a more quantitative measure of these changes, we
monitored signaling in K5þ/K10þ epidermal lysates (Fig.
6A). This method revealed a reduction in the amount of
C-Raf, B-Raf, and Roka in inhibitor-treated mice, irrespective of their genotype; in contrast, the amount of coﬁlin was
increased. The basis of these changes is currently unknown.
Irrespective of this, the experiment shows similar ERK
downstream signaling in inhibitor-treated B- and C-Raf–
deﬁcient epidermis, although there was a tendency toward
increased ERK signaling in vehicle-treated C-Raf KO tissue
(Figs. 5 and 6A; ref. 22); in contrast, phosphorylation of the

C-Raf, likely because of stimulation of signaling through ARaf (Supplementary Fig. S7). C-Raf-deﬁciency, however, was
sufﬁcient to reverse RasþGDC-0879 induced de-differentiation. K10-negative cells were conﬁned to the basal layer, and
reinstatement of differentiation correlated with the presence
of pCoﬁlin (Fig. 4E and F) and the absence of pSTAT3 and
nuclear Myc staining (Supplementary Fig. S5B), a sign that
Roka signaling was activated in the epidermis of inhibitortreated K5-SOS-F;c-rafKOep mice (14). Proliferation, differentiation, ERK, and coﬁlin phosphorylation were indistinguishable in vehicle and PLX-4032-treated K5-SOS-F;c-rafKOep and K5-SOS-F;b-rafKOep mice (Supplementary Fig. S4A
and S4B). To exclude the possibility that the ablation of B- or
C-Raf has different effects on downstream ERK signaling, we
tested the phosphorylation of cytosolic (RSK) and nuclear
(ELK1) ERK targets, as well as the expression of ERK-

Figure 6. GDC-0879 activates ERK signaling without interfering with the C-Raf/Roka interaction. A, immunoblot analysis of epidermal lysates (K5þ/K10þ cells)
from mice of the indicated genotypes treated with GDC-0879 for 8 days. B- and C-Raf, phosphorylated ERK (pERK), total (tERK), phosphorylated RSK (pRSK),
cFos p62 and p40, cyclin D1, Roka, phosphorylated coﬁlin (pCoﬁlin), and total (tCoﬁlin) were detected by immunoblotting. GAPDH is shown as a
loading control. The upregulation of cFos is most clearly seen in the p40 product. B, complex formation between C-Raf and Roka is increased in B-Raf KO
epidermis and is not affected by GDC-0879 treatment in vivo. Roka (top) or C-Raf (bottom) were immunoprecipitated from epidermal lysates obtained
from mice of the indicated genotypes, untreated or treated with GDC-0879 for 8 days. The presence of Roka, B-Raf, and C-Raf was visualized by
immunoblotting. Note the reduced amount of C-Raf i.p. loaded in lane 2 of the top panel. C, Raf dimerization is dispensable for the C-Raf/Roka interaction.
FLAG-tagged wild-type C-Raf or a dimerization mutant incapable of Raf dimerization was expressed in COS-7 cells. GDC-0879–treated or control cells were
lysed and the presence of Roka and B-Raf in the FLAG-C-Raf immunoprecipitates as well as ERK and coﬁlin phosphorylation in the lysates was determined
by immunoblotting.

Rok downstream target coﬁlin was abolished by GDC-0879
in B-Raf–deﬁcient epidermis, but was maintained in C-Raf–
deﬁcient epidermis (Fig. 6A).
We next investigated whether Raf inhibitors had any inﬂuence on the interaction between Roka and C-Raf by immunoprecipitating Roka from epidermal lysates of GDC-0879
or vehicle-treated mice. We found that inhibitor treatment
did not affect the amount of C-Raf co-precipitating with Roka,
but that more C-Raf bound to Roka in B-Raf–deﬁcient lysates;
B-Raf could not be detected in Roka immunoprecipitates
from epidermal lysates of vehicle- or inhibitor-treated mice
(Fig. 6B). This result was conﬁrmed by assessing the amount
of Roka and B-Raf in C-Raf immunoprecipitates from the
same epidermal lysates. In addition, a Raf dimerization-deﬁcient C-Raf mutant (4) failed to form heterodimers with B-Raf
but it still bound to Roka in a manner similar to wild-type
C-Raf in both untreated and Raf inhibitor-treated cells. Consistently, ERK but not coﬁlin phosphorylation was affected
by GDC-0879 treatment or by the expression of the Raf
dimerization-deﬁcient C-Raf mutant (Fig. 6C). These results
show that C-Raf homodimer formation is not required for
Roka binding or inhibition. They are in line with our previous
data showing that C-Raf/Roka interaction is a nonkinase
function of C-Raf mediated by the N-terminal regulatory
domain of C-Raf (17, 23, 24) and further support the hypothesis
that Ras þ Raf-inhibitor–induced tumors requires both Rafmediated ERK activation and a kinase-independent Roka
inhibition by C-Raf.
To causally link blockade of tumorigenesis and maintenance
of differentiation to the lack of C-Raf's inhibition of Roka, we
treated K5-SOS-F;c-rafKOep mice with both Raf and Roka
inhibitors (Figs. 7 and S8). Medium-term (18 days) treatment
with the selective and potent Rok inhibitor Y-27632, which
reactivates tumor development in K5-SOS-F;c-rafKOep epidermis (14), promoted proliferation in the GDC-0879 treated
K5-SOS-F;c-rafKOep forestomach (Supplementary Fig. S8A);
and longer treatment with another Rok inhibitor, Fasudil,
inhibited differentiation and induced proliferation as well as
the development of squamous cell carcinomas of the forestomach. This was accompanied by loss of coﬁlin phosphorylation (Fig. 7A–C). Surprisingly, cotreatment with Fasudil did
not induce tumor formation in the epidermis. This seems to
be because of a side-effect of the inhibitor in the epidermis,
namely the concomitant inhibition of Rok signaling and ERK
phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S8B), sporadically
observed in other tissues (25–27). ERK inhibition by Fasudil
is not observed in the forestomach (Fig. 7B), reinforcing
the concept that both ERK activation and the dimming of
Rok signaling are required for the formation of Ras plus Raf
inhibitor-driven epithelial tumors.

Discussion
Our results provide formal proof that Raf inhibitors increase
Ras-dependent ERK activation in vivo, and show that Ras
activation sufﬁces, in the absence of other mutations and
tumor-promoting inﬂammation, to render keratinocytes more
prone to forming tumors upon treatment with Raf inhibitors.

The development of drug-induced tumors in the K5-SOS-Fþ
esophagi and forestomachs, where cells express K5 but do not
give rise to tumors unless treated, indicates that Raf inhibitors
expand the spectrum of epithelial tumors induced by Ras
activation. Relevant for drug use in patients, both KRAS and
BRAF mutations can be detected in high-grade Barrett's
intraepithelial neoplasias and in Barret's adenocarcinoma (28).
Our results support a model in which inhibitor-driven Raf
and ERK activation are necessary and sufﬁcient for hyperproliferation of the epidermis; in the presence of SOS-F, differentiation is suppressed, leading to tumor formation (Supplementary Fig. S9). This is consistent with the assumption that the
level of ERK activation is rate limiting for tumorigenesis (1), a
concept that advocates the combination therapies using Raf
and MEK inhibitors (29) currently being tested in clinical trials
(30, 31). In support of this, PLX-4032, a weaker promoter of Raf
activation and ERK phosphorylation, does not lead to
increased proliferation in wild-type epidermis (Supplementary
Fig. S1); similarly, reducing ERK activation by cotreatment with
Trametinib (Supplementary Fig. S3) or by ablation of either BRaf or C-Raf (Supplementary Fig. S4) abrogates SOS-F–and
PLX-4032–induced ERK activation and tumorigenesis; thus, Band C-Raf are equally important in the context of PLX-4032induced pathway activation.
In contrast to PLX-4032, GDC-0879 can induce sustained
ERK activation and proliferation in WT epidermis, and
increases Ras-driven tumorigenesis in the absence of B-Raf
(Fig. 4). Taking into account that GDC-0879–induced ERK
activation is reduced in cells expressing a C-Raf dimerization
mutant (Fig. 6C; ref. 4), the most likely explanation for this
ﬁnding is that GDC-0879, but not PLX-4032, can facilitate Raf
activation in the context of C-Raf homodimers or of heterodimers containing A-Raf, as previously reported (5). In support
of this, GDC-0879 but not PLX-4032 is able to induce ERK
activation in keratinocytes lacking both B-Raf and C-Raf
(Supplementary Fig. S7).
Mechanistically, the fact that GDC-0879 sustains ERK activation in the absence of both B- or C-Raf in vivo indicates that Band C-Raf are redundant in this context and therefore that
conformational changes leading to kinase maturation/dimerization involving A-Raf (4, 5), rather than a more complex
mechanism involving reactivation of desensitized B-Raf (7),
are responsible for Raf/ERK activation and keratinocyte proliferation. Because Raf heterodimerization is not readily
detected in other cell types (5, 7), these data suggest a potential
explanation for the selective effects of the drugs on the squamous epithelia.
The increase in ERK activation and proliferation is necessary
but not sufﬁcient for the development of tumors; concomitant
dedifferentiation, induced by SOS-F and requiring C-Raf as
endogenous inhibitor of the Roka signaling pathway, is also
indispensable (Supplementary Fig. S9). This concept is clearly
illustrated by the lack of tumor development in SOS-Fþ,
C-Raf–deﬁcient epidermis treated with GDC-0879, despite
increased ERK activation and proliferation (Figs. 4 and 5); and
by the induction of squamous cell carcinomas in the forestomach of K5-SOS-F;c-rafKOep mice treated with both Raf and
Roka inhibitors (Fig. 7).

homodimerization, but it is increased in SOS-Fþ, B-Raf–deﬁcient epidermis; whether B-Raf ablation frees up an additional
pool of C-Raf for Roka interaction or whether more indirect
mechanisms are responsible for this effect is currently unclear.
Collectively, our results verify the disquieting hypothesis
that Raf inhibitors dramatically exacerbate Ras-driven tumorigenesis in vivo, and extend the range of target tissues to gastric
epithelia. Drug-induced epidermal tumors develop in mice
with epidermis-restricted B-Raf ablation, whereas C-Raf ablation prevents tumorigenesis despite increased ERK activation
by enforcing keratinocyte differentiation. These data suggests
that combination therapies targeting kinase and nonkinase
functions of Raf may be more efﬁcient and safer for the
treatment of skin tumors.
