ABSTRACT
MicroRNA-381 (miR-381) is a highly expressed onco-miRNA that is involved in
malignant progression and has been suggested to be a good target for glioblastoma
multiforme (GBM) therapy. In this study, we employed two-dimensional fluorescence
differential gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) and MALDI–TOF/TOF-MS/MS to identify 27
differentially expressed proteins, including the significantly upregulated neurofilament
light polypeptide (NEFL), in glioblastoma cells in which miR-381 expression was
inhibited. We identified NEFL as a novel target molecule of miR-381 and a tumor
suppressor gene. In human astrocytoma clinical specimens, NEFL was downregulated
with increased levels of miR-381 expression. Either suppressing miR-381 or enforcing
NEFL expression dramatically sensitized glioblastoma cells to temozolomide (TMZ),
a promising chemotherapeutic agent for treating GBMs. The mechanism by which
these cells were sensitized to TMZ was investigated by inhibiting various multidrug
resistance factors (ABCG2, ABCC3, and ABCC5) and stemness factors (ALDH1, CD44,
CKIT, KLF4, Nanog, Nestin, and SOX2). Our results further demonstrated that miR381 overexpression reversed the viability of U251 cells exhibiting NEFL-mediated TMZ
sensitivity. In addition, NEFL-siRNA also reversed the proliferation rate of U251 cells
exhibiting locked nucleic acid (LNA)-anti-miR-381-mediated TMZ sensitivity. Overall,
the miR-381-NEFL axis is important for TMZ resistance in GBM and may potentially
serve as a novel therapeutic target for glioma.

INTRODUCTION

patients and has been shown to restrain tumor growth
for a few months, its resistance is common and accounts
for many treatment failures[4, 5]. Recent studies have
linked this drug resistance to the altered expression
of miRNAs, and therefore, miRNA-based approaches
modulating the sensitivity to TMZ could help to overcome
chemoresistance[6-11].
It is known that miRNAs play important roles
in cancer cell proliferation, aggressiveness and

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most
malignant form of glioma, is highly aggressive and
neurologically destructive [1, 2]. Despite the combination
of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the average
life expectancy of GBM patients is only 15 months [3].
Although temozolomide (TMZ), a DNA alkylating
antineoplastic drug, has been used universally in GBM

metastasis[12]. It has been reported that miR-195,
miR-455-3p and miR-10a* are highly expressed in the
induced TMZ-resistant U251R cell line and that miR195 inhibition enhances TMZ-induced cell death[6].
Additionally, combined treatment of miR-21 inhibitor
with TMZ significantly enhances human glioblastoma
stem cell apoptosis[7], and miR-143, as a tumor
suppressor, sensitizes glioma cells to TMZ by targeting
N-RAS[8]. Interestingly, miR-125b inhibitor boosts the
chemosensitivity of glioblastoma stem cells to TMZ
by targeting Bak1[9], whereas the miR-128, miR-149
and miR-181 families enhance the chemosensitivity of
glioblastoma cells to TMZ by targeting Rap1B[10, 11].
Furthermore, miR-381 is involved in the
development and progression of multiple types of
cancers, such as prostate cancer[13], renal cancer[14],
lung cancer[15], ovarian cancer[16] and glioma[17,
18]. Additionally, miR-381 has been shown to modulate
sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents. For example,
miR-381 increases the sensitivity of renal cancer cells to
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) by inhibiting WEE1[14], and miR381 modulates the MDR phenotype in leukemia cells
and increases their drug uptake[19]. Notably, miR-381
expression is significantly higher in drug-resistant than in
drug-sensitive ovarian cancer tissues. Our previous study
indicated that miR-381 plays an oncogenic role and is
involved in the pathogenesis of GBM[17]. Furthermore,
silencing miR-381 inhibits the growth of intracranially
transplanted GBM in rats, as determined by magnetic
resonance imaging[18]. Here, we explored the effects of
miR-381 inhibition on the chemosensitivity of GBM cells
to TMZ.
The NEFL gene encodes a type IV intermediate
filament, which forms heteropolymers that functionally
maintain the neuronal caliber and play an important role
in intracellular transport of neurotransmitters to axons
and dendrites[20]. NEFL is located on chromosome 8p21,
which has been identified as a genetic locus frequently
affected by both heterozygous and homozygous deletions
in a variety of common human cancers, including prostate
cancer[21], breast cancer[22, 23] and head and neck cancer
(HNC)[24, 25]. These characteristics implicate NEFL as a
potential tumor suppresser gene. NEFL is downregulated
by its hypermethylation in breast cancer[23] and HNC[25].
Downregulated NEFL expression due to hypermethylation
was associated with resistance to cisplatin-based
chemotherapy, and re-expression of NEFL significantly
increased the sensitivity of HNC to the drug through the
mTOR pathway[25].
Based on research suggesting that miR-381
promotes the growth of glioblastoma cells[17, 18], we
performed 2D-DIGE and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry
to screen differentially expressing proteins regulated by
miR-381. We identified NEFL as a novel target of miR381 that was apparently downregulated in GBM, and
we showed that inhibition of miR-381 enhanced the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

sensitivity of NEFL-mediated stemness factors to TMZ in
GBM.

RESULTS
Differentially expressed proteins regulated by
LNA-anti-miR-381
After performing 2-D DIGE, the Cy2, Cy3, and Cy5
channels of the individual gels were imaged and analyzed
using the DeCyder 5.0 software. As shown in Figure 1A,
39 matched protein spots had significant differences in the
signal intensity between the U251 cells transfected with
LNA-anti-miR-381 or LNA-anti-miR-NC, suggesting
that these proteins were differentially expressed. Fifteen
of the 39 proteins were significantly upregulated in U251
cells transfected with LNA-anti-miR-381 inhibitor as the
ratio of the protein in U251- LNA-anti-miR-381 to that
in U251- LNA-anti-miR-NC was ≥ 2 (P ≤ 0.05), while
24 out of 39 proteins were significantly down-regulated
( P ≤ 0.05). The 39 protein spots were excised from the
gel in Figure 1B, digested with trypsin and identified by
MALDI-TOF MS peptide mass fingerprinting. Twenty
seven differentially expressed proteins were successfully
identified by MS (Table 1), and were functionally involved
in metabolism, proliferation,signal transduction, structural
protein, translation, cell death, autophagic, cytoskeleton
organization, chaperone and so on (Table 1, annotation
using the Swiss-Prot database).
To verify their differential expression, the U251LNA-anti-miR-NC and U251-LNA-anti-miR-381 cell
lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies
against annexin I (ANXA1), neurofilament, light
polypeptide 68 kDa (NEFL), glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP), heat shock 70 kDa protein 8 isoform 1 (HSPA8),
aspartate aminotransferase 1 (AST1), Septin 2, Cathepsin
D (Cath D) and caldesmon 1 isoform 2 (CALD1). As
shown in Figure 1C, the relative levels of ANXA1,
NEFL, GFAP, HSPA8, Septin 2 and Cath D expression
to the levels of the GAPDH control were upregulated in
U251-LNA-anti-miR-381-transfected cells, compared to
U251-LNA-anti-miR-NC cells, but NEFL expression was
particularly upregulated. In contrast, the relative levels of
AST1 and CaMBP expression to GAPDH control levels
were downregulated in U251-LNA-anti-miR-381 cells.
These two independent lines of evidence demonstrated
that these proteins were regulated by LNA-anti-miR-381
inhibitor in glioblastoma cells.

NEFL is a new target molecule of miR-381
The differentially expressed protein NEFL has been
thought to be a putative target of miR-381 by miRanda
(Fig. 2A). Therefore, HEK293 and U251 cells were co3149

transfected with the wild type (WT) or mutated (Mut)
NEFL luciferase reporter vector, together with miR-381
or miR-NC, for 24 h. Luciferase activity was significantly
reduced in cells transfected with WT NEFL and miR381, but not in the cells transfected with Mut NEFL and
miR-381 (Fig. 2B). Quantitative real time (qRT) PCR and
western blotting analysis indicated that the expression of
the NEFL mRNA and protein was downregulated in miR381-treated U251 cells (Fig. 2C and D) but was increased
in LNA-anti-miR-381-transfected cells (Fig. 2E and F).
These results suggest that miR-381 directly targets NEFL

by binding to its seed region in their 3’-UTRs.

NEFL is reduced in glioma tissues and cell lines,
and its overexpression suppresses the proliferation
and invasion of U251 cells
First, we analyzed the expression of NEFL in the
glioblastoma cell lines U251 and U87. We showed that
the NEFL protein level was reduced in glioblastoma
cells compared to non-tumor brain tissues (Fig. 3A).

Interestingly, the expression of NEFL was slightly
higher in U87 than U251 cells, and the U87 cells were
less resistant to TMZ than the U251 cells (Fig. S1C).
Compared with cells transfected with the empty vector,
NEFL overexpression inhibited the proliferation (Fig. 3B),
migration (Fig. 3C), and invasion (Fig. 3D) of the U251
cells. We also used U87 cells to assess the role of NEFL
in regulating the cell proliferation (Fig. S1A) and invasion
(Fig. S1B) of GBM cells, and these results were consistent
with those of the U251 cells.
Our previous study showed that relative to normal
adult brain, miR-381 was highly expressed in different
brain cancer subtypes, including GBM[17]. Therefore,
we measured the expression levels of NEFL in 12 normal
brain tissues and 52 astrocytoma samples. RT-qPCR
assays showed that NEFL expression was significantly
decreased in the astrocytoma samples compared with
the normal brain tissues (Fig. 3E). We then divided
the astrocytoma samples into grade I (n=15), grade II
(n=12), grade III (n=14), or grade IV (n=11) according
to WHO classification. NEFL was downregulated in
the 4 astrocytoma groups compared with the normal
brain group (p≤0.01; Fig. 3F). However, the NEFL
expression in high-grade tumors (WHO Grades III and
IV) showed no significant differences compared to that
of low-grade tumors (WHO Grade I and II) (Fig. 3F).
Immunohistochemistry analysis of the NEFL expression

in normal brain and astrocytoma tissues showed a similar
result (Fig. 3G). Moreover, we analyzed the expression
pattern of miR-381 in tissues using in situ hybridization
(Fig. 3G). Because NEFL is a target molecule of miR381, we also determined the correlation between NEFL
and miR-381 in astrocytoma samples. We observed that
NEFL was inversely correlated with miR-381 expression
in the analyzed astrocytomas (n=15) (Spearman’s
correlation, r = -0.8179) (Fig. 3H), which suggested that
NEFL acts as a putative tumor suppressor in glioma and
that both downregulated NEFL and upregulated miR-381
expression are involved in gliomagenesis.

NEFL increases the chemosensitivity of
glioblastoma cells to TMZ by regulating
multidrug resistance and stemness factors
Resistance to TMZ is one of the major causes of
failed GBM chemotherapy; therefore, it is critical to
discover new strategies that increase the effectiveness
of TMZ treatment. After NEFL overexpression (Fig. 4A
and B) or NEFL knockdown (Fig. 4C and D), we treated
U251 cells with different concentrations of TMZ. As
shown in Figure 4E, when compared to control group
cells, NEFL overexpression significantly increased the
chemosensitivity of U251 cells to TMZ treatment, as

observed by the significant suppression of cell viability
after TMZ treatment and by the inverse correlation of
the drug concentrations to cell viability. However, NEFL
siRNA decreased the chemosensitivity of the cells to TMZ
treatment (Fig. 4F). To identify the mechanism by which
NEFL enhances the chemosensitivity of glioblastoma cells
to TMZ, the expression of multidrug resistance factors was
analyzed by RT-qPCR. NEFL overexpression significantly
downregulated the multidrug resistance factors ABCG2,
ABCC3, and ABCC5 in U251 cells, both at the protein
(Fig. 4B) and mRNA level (Fig. 4G). Similar results
were obtained for U87 cells (Fig. S1E). Furthermore,
the expression of ABCG2, ABCC3, and ABCC5 was

upregulated after inhibiting the expression of NEFL (Fig.
4D and H).
We also analyzed the expression of the stemness
factors ALDH1, CD44, CKIT, KLF4, Nanog, Nestin, and
SOX2. NEFL overexpression decreased the expression of
ALDH1, CD44, CKIT, KLF4, Nanog, Nestin, and SOX2
(Fig. 4I), whereas silencing NEFL increased the expression
of ALDH1, CD44, CKIT, KLF4, Nanog, Nestin, and
SOX2 (Fig. 4J). The above-mentioned data indicate that
NEFL increases the chemosensitivity of glioblastoma cells
to TMZ by regulating multidrug resistance and stemness
factors. We observed similar results in U87 cells (Fig.
S1E).

the sensitivity of U251 cells to TMZ (Fig. 5B), while
silencing the expression of NEFL with siRNA resisted the
sensitizing effects of LNA-anti-miR-381 to TMZ (Fig.
5B). Subsequently, the multidrug resistance and stemness
factors were also investigated using RT-qPCR. LNAanti-miR-381 downregulated the expression of multidrug
resistance factors (ABCG2, ABCC3, and ABCC5) and
stemness factors (CD44, CKIT, KLF4, Nanog, and
Nestin2) in these cells (Fig. 5C and D). Interestingly, when
NEFL expression was interfered with during the LNA-

anti-miR-381 treatment, the expression of the multidrug
resistance factors (ABCG2, ABCC3, and ABCC5) and
stemness factors (CD44, CKIT, KLF4, Nanog, and
Nestin2) (Fig. 5C and D) was restored. We observed
similar results in U87 cells (Fig. S1F). These results
suggested that NEFL siRNA reverses the proliferation rate
of LNA-anti-miR-381-transfected, TMZ-sensitive U251
cells. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show that
miR-381 regulates the chemosensitivity of glioblastoma
cells to TMZ treatment through expressing NEFL.

Figure 5: NEFL-siRNA reverses the sensitivity of LNA-anti-miR-381-treated cells to TMZ. A: U251 cells transfected with

LNA-anti-miR-NC or LNA-anti-miR-381 were forced to repress the expression of NEFL, were treated with various concentrations of TMZ
for 48 h and were then submitted to CCK8 assays. The results showed that LNA-anti-miR-381 significantly increased the chemosensitivity
of U251 cells to TMZ. Silencing the expression of NEFL inhibited the effects of LNA-anti-miR-381. B: U251 cells transfected with LNAanti-miR-NC or LNA-anti-miR-381 were forced to repress the expression of NEFL, were treated with 100 μM TMZ for the indicated
times, and were then subjected to CCK8 assays. The results showed that transfected LNA-anti-miR-381 decreased the proliferation of
U251 cells and enhanced their sensitivity to TMZ. NEFL-siRNA prevented the sensitizing effects of LNA-anti-miR-381 to TMZ. C: RTqPCR analysis showing that the mRNA level of multidrug resistance factors (ABCG2, ABCC3, ABCC5) were repressed in U251 cells after

miR-381 mimics disrupt the sensitization of NEFL
to TMZ in glioblastoma cells

their chemosensitivity. Furthermore, cell viability in the
presence of TMZ (100 μM) was assayed at different time
points. NEFL overexpression significantly prevented
the proliferation of U251 cells in the presence of TMZ;
however, this inhibited proliferation was restored by
miR-381 overexpression (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, miR381 overexpression increased the expression of multidrug
resistance factors and stemness factors that were blocked
by NEFL overexpression combined with TMZ treatment
(Fig. 6C and 6D). These results suggest that NEFL induces
chemosensitivity of U251 cells to TMZ treatment in an
miR-381-dependent manner.

We then investigated whether miR-381 is
involved in the NEFL-mediated increased sensitivity
of glioblastoma U251 cells to TMZ by transfecting
the cells with miR-381 mimics (pre-transfected with
vector or NEFL) for 8 h and then treating the cells with
different concentrations of TMZ. Cell viability was
then determined after 48 h of treatment. As shown in
Figure 6A, the overexpression of NEFL in U251 cells
significantly increased their chemosensitivity to TMZ
treatment, whereas miR-381 overexpression inhibited

Figure 6: miR-381 disrupts the sensitization of U251 cells to TMZ via NEFL. A: U251 cells were transfected with either empty

vector or NEFL and were forced to overexpress miR-381. Subsequently, the cells were treated with various concentrations of TMZ for 48
h and then submitted to CCK8 assays. The results showed that NEFL overexpression significantly increased the chemosensitivity of U251
cells to TMZ treatment. miR-381 inhibited the effects of NEFL. B: U251 cells were transfected with either empty vector or NEFL and were
forced to overexpress miR-381. The cells were then treated with 100 μM TMZ for the indicated times and then subjected to CCK8 assays.
The results showed that NEFL decreased the proliferation and enhanced the sensitivity of U251 cells to TMZ, while miR-381 inhibited
the sensitizing effects of NEFL to TMZ. C: RT-qPCR analysis showing that the mRNA levels of multidrug resistance factors (ABCG2,
ABCC3, ABCC5) were repressed in U251 cells after NEFL overexpression and were restored by miR-381. D: RT-qPCR analysis showing
that the mRNA level of stemness factors (CD44, CKIT, KLF4, Nanog, and Nestin) were repressed in U251 cells after NEFL overexpression

NEFL sensitizes glioblastoma cells to TMZ by
inhibiting the mTOR pathway

pathway, was then analyzed in U251 cells (Fig. 7A and B).
Restoration of NEFL expression using a pcDNA3.1/NEFL
vector suppressed p70S6k phosphorylation in U251 cells
(Fig. 7A), whereas downregulation of NEFL expression
by miR-381 resulted in increased phosphorylation of
ribosomal protein S6 and p70S6k in U251 cells (Fig. 7B).
NEFL modulation of mTOR pathway activation
indicated a role for mTOR activity in cellular TMZ
responsiveness. To test this possibility, we examined the
effects of an mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, on U251 cells.
The cells were treated with 40 μM rapamycin for 24 h,
incubated with different concentrations of TMZ, and then
submitted to CCK8 assays 24 h later. The rapamycin
treatment increased the chemosensitivity of the U251 cells
to TMZ (Fig. 7C), and most importantly, the combined
treatment of TMZ and rapamycin significantly inhibited
U251 cell growth (Fig. 7D).

TMZ can induce the activation of AMPK in
glioblastoma cells, while the activation of AMPK inhibits
mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling[26]. Tuberous
sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) functions as a molecular
inhibitor of the mTOR oncogenic pathway[27], and NEFL
has been shown to bind TSC1 and stabilize the TSC1/2
complex[28]. Furthermore, the downregulation of NEFL
has been shown to lead to abnormal activation of the
mTOR pathway[25]. Therefore, we hypothesized that the
abnormal expression of NEFL leading to mTOR pathway
change would confer TMZ resistance.
To test this hypothesis, we examined the status
of the mTOR pathway and the effects of altered NEFL
expression in U251 cell lines overexpressing NEFL
(Fig. 7A) or miR-381 (Fig. 7B). Consistent with our
hypothesis, mTOR pathway activity was inhibited upon
NEFL overexpression. The phosphorylation of ribosomal
protein S6 and p70S6k, critical downstream substrates of
activated mTOR and known indicators of an active mTOR

of many cancers[13-18]. Our previous research indicated
that miR-381 is highly expressed in different grades of
astrocytomas. We also showed that miR-381 targets the
LRRC4 gene, a known tumor suppressor of glioma, that
overexpression of LRRC4 downregulates the expression
of miR-381, and that the interaction between miR-381
and LRRC4 is involved in glioma growth[17]. LNA-antimiR-381 oligonucleotides inhibited the proliferation of
glioblastoma cells in vitro and the growth of intracranial
transplanted glioblastoma model in vivo, as determined
by magnetic resonance imaging[18], which suggests that
miR-381 is a good target for glioma therapy.
In this study, we analyzed the effects of miR-381
on the proteomic profiles of glioblastoma cells using
the 2D-DIGE method. Compared with control cells, 39
proteins were differentially expressed in the LNA-antimiR-381-treated U251 cells. Twenty-seven proteins,
identified by MADLE-TOF-MS/MS, were functionally
involved in processes such as metabolism, proliferation,
signal transduction, cell structure, translation, cell death,
autophagy, inflammation, and cytoskeleton organization,
among others, and some were and chaperones. Western
blotting analysis indicated that ANXA1, NEFL, GFAP,
HSPA8, Septin 2 and Cath D were upregulated, while
AST1 and CALD1 were downregulated in LNA-anti-miR381-treated U251 cells.
Annexin I, which belongs to a family of Ca(2+)dependent phospholipid-binding proteins, is an
important anti-inflammatory factor[29]. NEFL, a type
IV intermediate filament, comprises the axoskeleton
and plays a key role in intracellular transport to axons
and dendrites[20]. GFAP, one of the major intermediate
filament proteins of mature astrocytes, is used as a
marker to distinguish astrocytes from other glial cells
during development[30]. HSPA8, a member of the heat
shock protein 70 family, functions as a chaperone and
binds to nascent polypeptides to facilitate their correct
folding[31]. Septin 2, a conserved family of polymerizing
guanosine triphosphate-binding protein, localizes to
the metaphase plate during mitosis and is crucial for
chromosome congression and segregation[32]. Cath
D, a lysosomal aspartyl protease, is associated with
autophagy, collagen catabolism, extracellular matrix
disassembly and organization[33]. AST1 is a pyridoxal
phosphate-dependent enzyme that plays a role in amino
acid metabolism and in the urea and tricarboxylic acid
cycles[34]. CALD1, a calmodulin- and actin-binding
protein, is a potent inhibitor of actin-tropomyosinactivated myosin, MgATPase, and modulates Ca(2+)dependent inhibition of smooth muscle contraction[35].
We observed that miR-381 affected the metabolism,
proliferation, and signal transduction of glioma cells
through regulating these proteins. Considering that
NEFL is a direct target of miR-381, we focused on the
relationship between LNA-anti-miR-381, NEFL, and
TMZ chemosensitivity.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

GBM is the most aggressive and deadly form of
glioma, and TMZ is a promising chemotherapeutic agent
for these types of cancer; however, resistance develops
quickly and at a high frequency[4, 5]. Several studies
have suggested that miRNAs are novel players in the
development of chemoresistance. Ectopically expressed
miR-34a sensitizes colorectal cancer cells to 5-FU[36],
and miR-211 in combination with ionizing radiation (IR)
and TMZ treatment significantly induces glioma cell
apoptosis and DNA fragmentation[37]. In this study, we
found that targeted inhibition of miR-381 promotes the
effects of TMZ and that transfection of LNA-anti-miR-381
in combination with TMZ treatment more potently inhibits
cell proliferation compared to TMZ treatment alone.
Thus, it is important to note that targeted inhibition of
miR-381 offers a new modulation strategy to overcome
chemoresistance of glioma to TMZ treatment.
NEFL, a potential tumor suppresser [21, 22, 24], is
associated with resistance to cisplatin-based chemotherapy,
and re-expression of NEFL in HNC significantly increases
the sensitivity of the cells to the drug[25]. Our study
indicated that NEFL is a new target molecule of miR-381
and is downregulated in astrocytoma. Overexpression
of NEFL significantly suppressed the proliferation and
invasion of U251 cells and enhanced the chemosensitivity
of glioblastoma cells to TMZ. More importantly, the
inhibition of NEFL expression by siRNA recovered TMZ
resistance after upregulating NEFL expression, which
induced TMZ sensitivity, by transfection of an miR381 inhibitor. Correspondingly, overexpression of miR381 disrupted the sensitization of glioblastoma cells to
TMZ. Thus, the miR-381-NEFL axis is critical for TMZ
resistance in GBM, and targeted inhibition of miR-381 or
NEFL restoration may offer a new strategy to overcome
chemoresistance of glioblastoma to TMZ treatment.
Cancer stem cells are a small population of
cells within a tumor that tend to share some common
features with stem or progenitor cells, including selfrenewal and differentiation capability[38]. These cancer
stem cells (CSCs) are thought to be responsible not
only for primary tumorigenesis but also for resistance
to chemotherapy and subsequent cancer recurrence.
Accumulating evidence has suggested that chemotherapy
failure might be blamed for the existence of CSCs[39],
and a variety of mechanisms have been proposed to
contribute to CSC chemoresistance, including relative
quiescence, expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporters and/or multidrug resistance transporter 1
(MDR1), a more robust DNA repair capability, and the
elevated expression of antiapoptotic proteins[38]. All of
these characteristics together make CSCs a particularly
challenging target for chemotherapy[40]. ALDH1, CD44,
CKIT, KLF4, Nanog, Nestin, and SOX2 are important
stem cell markers. ALDH1, as a novel stem cell marker
in human GBM-positive glioblastoma cells, is involved
in giving brain tumors stem cell capacity[41]. CD44, a
3157

Oncotarget

glycoprotein transmembrane receptor, is a marker of stem
cells from a variety of normal and neoplastic tissues and
is associated with treatment resistance of glioma[42]. The
interaction between hyaluronan and CD44 activates the
stem cell marker Nanog, Stat-3-mediated MDR1 gene
expression, and ankyrin-regulated multidrug efflux in
breast and ovarian tumor cells[43], and it can also lead
to Bcl-2 expression and chemoresistance in breast cancer
cells[44]. CD44+/CD24-/Low CSCs display resistance to
conventional chemotherapy. Interestingly, inhibition of
Cdk2 kinase activity selectively targets and restores the
chemosensitivity of SUM149PT in a CD44+/CD24-/Low
stem-like subpopulation of triple-negative breast cancer
cells[45]. CKIT is a type 3 transmembrane receptor for
mast cell growth factor (MGF) and is a known stem
cell factor. Secondary c-Kit mutations confer acquired
resistance to RTK inhibitors in c-Kit mutant melanoma
cells[46], and KIT copy number gain may be a mechanism
by which melanomas acquire therapeutic resistance to
imatinib[47]. In addition, promoter hypermethylation of
KLF4 inhibits the chemosensitivity of cervical carcinoma
to cisplatin [48]. Nanog expression has been found in
multipotent brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs) and found to
vary from early generation to late generation-BTSCs[49].
TALEN-mediated Nanog disruption results in less
invasiveness, more chemosensitivity and reversal of EMT
in HeLa cells[50], and knockdown of Nanog enhances
the chemosensitivity of liver cancer cells to doxorubicin
by reducing MDR1 expression[51]. Nestin is expressed
primarily in nerve cells, might contribute to the initiation,
promotion, and progression of tumors and is associated
with chemotherapy resistance[52,53]. SOX2 is required
for stem-cell maintenance in the central nervous system,
and Sox2-dependent activation of Wnt signaling drives
the development of tamoxifen resistance in cancer stem/
progenitor cells[54].
Our research indicated that either suppressing miR381 or enhancing NEFL expression sensitizes glioblastoma
cells to TMZ by inhibiting stemness factors (ALDH1,
CD44, CKIT, KLF4, Nanog, Nestin, and SOX2). Our data
suggested that targeted inhibition of miR-381 enhances the
sensitivity of cells to TMZ in glioblastoma by inhibiting
stemness factors and that NEFL regulates the expression
of stemness factors.
CD133 is recognized as an important marker to
identify and isolate CSCs[55]. Many studies have shown
that CD133+ cells are highly chemoresistant[56,57], for
example, those in small cell lung cancer[56]. CD133+
melanoma stem-like cells confer resistance to taxolinduced apoptosis [57]; however, Jian Wang et al. showed
the negative expression of CD133 in U251 and U87
cells[58]. We analyzed the expression of CD133 using
real-time qPCR, and the results showed that the expression
level of CD133 in U251 cells is very low (data not shown).
Cancer stem cells are recognized to be the origin
of cancer and the basis of cancer malignant phenotypes,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

including multidrug resistance[38]. The multidrug
resistance factors ABCG2, ABCC3, and ABCC5
belong to the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) transporters[59], which function as xenobiotic
transporters and may play a major role in multidrug
resistance[60]. Downregulation of ABCG2 expression
decreases the chemoresistance of glioblastoma cancer
stem cells[61], and ABCC3 and ABCC5 have been
reported to be expressed higher than the other ABCC
subfamily members in glioma[62, 63]. Furthermore,
high expression of ABCC3 and ABCC5 in tumor biopsy
samples is linked to a higher risk of death[63, 64].
ABCC3 is expressed more in differentiated glioma cells
and regulates multidrug resistance[65, 66], while ABCB1
and ABCC4 are important multidrug resistance factors.
Drug-resistant CD133+ CSCs isolated from U138MG
cells exhibit increased expression of ABCB1 and ABCC4
[67]; therefore, because the U251 and U87 cell lines are
CD133-, we did not focus on ABCB1 and ABCC4.
Our data demonstrated that either suppressing miR381 or enforcing NEFL expression inhibited the expression
of multidrug resistance factors (ABCG2, ABCC3, and
ABCC5) in glioblastoma cells in the presence of TMZ.
These data suggested that targeted inhibition of miR-381
enhances the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to TMZ by
inhibiting NEFL-mediated expression of stemness and
multidrug resistance factors.
In summary, our present research shows that miR381 is a good target for glioma therapy, and that targeted
inhibition of miR-381 enhances the sensitivity of GBM to
temozolomide through the regulation of stemness factors
by NEFL. Moreover, the miR-381-NEFL axis is critical
for TMZ resistance in GBM and may potentially serve as
a novel therapeutic target for glioma.

The LNA-anti-miR-381 induced differential
expression of proteins in glioma cells was characterized by
2-D DIGE analysis, as described previously[68]. Briefly,
U251 cells were transfected with LNA-anti-miR-381 or
LNA-anti-miR-NC as control. The U251- anti-miR-NC
and U251- anti-miR-381 cells were harvested, and the
proteins in cell lysates were extracted. Subsequently,
these lysate proteins were treated using the ReadyPrep
2D Clean-up kit, according the manufacturers’ instruction
(Bio-Rad). The lysate proteins were re-suspended in lysis
buffer (8 M urea, 4% w/v CHAPS, 30 mM Tris-Cl, pH
8.5), and determined for their protein concentrations using
BCA (Pirece, USA). These proteins were labeled with 400
pmol of fluorescence dye per 100m g of lysates proteins
using the DIGE labeling solution (GE Healthcare). A
total of 20 mg of proteins from each group was mixed
with the same volume of DIGE 2 × buffer (8 M urea, 4%
w/v CHAPS, 2% w/v DTT, 2% v/v Pharmalytes 3–10 for
IEF), and 20 mg of individual samples were diluted in
rehydration solution (8 M urea, 0.5% w/v CHAPS, 0.2%
w/v DTT, and 0.2% v/v Pharmalyte pH 3-10) and loaded
on IPG strips (18 cm, pH 3–10, non-linear, GE Healthcare)
for 2-D gel electrophoresis. Fluorescence images were
acquired using the Ettan DIGE imager (GE Healthcare),
and the DIGE gels were analyzed using the DIA module
of the Decyder software (Version 6.5, GE healthcare). To
prepare gels for capturing the spots of interest, 500~1000

mg of proteins were subjected to 2-D DIGE on IPG strips
and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The protein
spots of interest were excised and destained with 25 mM
ammonium bicarbonate/50% acetonitrile (CAN), followed
by in-gel digestion with 0.01 mg/ ml trypsin (Promega,
USA) in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 15 h at 37°C.
The hydrolysates were collected, and the tryptic peptides
were extracted from the gel pieces sequentially with 5%
TFA at 40°C for 1 h, and with 2.5% TFA, 50% ACN
at 30°C for 1 h. The extracts were pooled, lyophilized,
and stored at -20°C until use. Gel pieces from a ‘‘blank’’
region and from BSA molecular mass marker were used
as negative and positive controls, respectively. The peptide
mixtures were re-dissolved in 0.5% of TFA, and 1 ml of
peptide solution was mixed with equal volume of matrix
(4-hydroxy-alpha- cyanocinnamic acid, HCCA in 30%
ACN/0.1% TFA), followed by spotting on the target plate.
Individual protein peptides were identified by MALDITOF mass spectrometry on a 4700 proteomics analyzer

Luciferase reporter assay
The 3’-UTR of NEFL were synthesized and
annealed, then inserted into the SpeI and HindIII sites of
pMIR-reporter luciferase vector (Ambion) at downstream
of the stop codon of the gene for luciferase. For its
mutagenesis, the sequences complementary to the binding
site of miR-381 in the 3’-UTR (NEFL:CTTGTAT) was
replaced by TACTTGAC. These constructs were validated
by sequencing. U251 cells were seeded into a 24-well
plate for luciferase assay. After cultured overnight, cells
were cotransfected with the wild-type or mutated plasmid,
pRL-TK plasmid, and equal amounts of miR-381 or miRNC. And the pRL-TK control vector was transfected
as a control. Luciferase assays were performed 24 h
after transfection using the Dual Luciferase Reporter
Assay System (Promega, WI, USA). Firefly and Renilla
reniformis luciferase activities were measured 24 h
later. Experiments were performed in three independent
replicates.

Quantitative real time-PCR analysis
Real-time PCR was carried out as previously
described[69]. RNA was isolated from harvested cells
or human tissues with Trizol reagent according to the
manufacturer’s instruction (Invitrogen, CA, USA). Realtime PCR reactions were performed using SYBR Premix
DimerEraser (Takara, Dalian, China) and human GAPDH
or U6 snRNA was used as an endogenous control for
mRNA or miRNA detection, respectively. Expression of
each gene was quantified by measuring Ct values and
normalized using the 2-ΔΔct method relative to U6 snRNA
or GAPDH. The primers used in this study were depicted
in supplementary Table 2.

Cell viability assay
Cell viability was determined by the CCK8 assay.
Briefly, 2000 cells/well were seeded into 96-well plates
and were treated by miRNA or plasmid vector transient

*) are implicated in acquired temozolomide resistance
in glioblastoma multiforme cells. Cancer Lett. 2010;
296(2):241-8.

The chemosensitivity of the cell was determined by
the CCK8 assay. Briefly, cells were seeded and transfected
with miRNA or Plasmid using the Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) transfection agent . After 12 h, the cells were
reseeded in 96-well plate s at a density of 4,000 cells per
well and treated with TMZ (12.5-800µM) for 48 h. Cell
survival was analyzed using the CKK8 kit (Beyotime
Institute of Biotechnology, Jiangsu, China) and absorbance
was read at 450 nM on a microplate reader (Bioteck).
Data were from three separate experiments with four
replications each time.

All experiments were performed three times and
data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism 5 (La Jolla,
CA, USA). The correlation between miR-381 expression
and NEFL levels in tumor tissues were analyzed using
Spearman’s rank test. Differences between the variables
of the groups were tested using the Student’s t-test or oneway ANOVA, using the SPSS 15.0 program. A p-value of
<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant
result.
