BACKGROUND: Efficacy trials have shown that antiviral therapy improves the outcomes of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus
(HBV) infection. However, prospective data regarding the effect of antiviral therapy on the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC), especially among patients without cirrhosis, are limited. The authors examined the impact of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
(TDF) on the incidence of HCC using a validated prediction model. METHODS: The incidence of HCC in patients treated with TDF
was obtained in the pivotal TDF registration studies after 384 weeks of follow-up. The predicted risk of HCC in individual patients
was calculated using the Risk Estimation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Chronic Hepatitis B (REACH-B) model, which estimates
HCC incidence for up to 10 years based on age, sex, alanine aminotransferase level, hepatitis B e antigen status, and HBV-DNA.
Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated comparing the observed and predicted numbers of HCC cases in the study
cohort. RESULTS: Among 634 patients with evaluable baseline biopsies, 152 had cirrhosis (Ishak fibrosis score of 5 or 6) and 482 did
not. During the 384 weeks of study, 14 cases of HCC were reported, with 4 occurring within the first year. The incidence of HCC was
0.37% per year in the study as a whole (0.28% among patients without cirrhosis and 0.65% among patients with cirrhosis). Among
patients without cirrhosis, the observed incidence of HCC was significantly lower than predicted (SIR, 0.40; 95% confidence interval,
0.199-0.795). The last HCC case in a patient with cirrhosis occurred around week 192 with an SIR of 0.51 (95% confidence interval,
0.231-1.144) reported at week 384. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the REACH-B risk calculator, long-term therapy with TDF was associated
C 2015 Ameriwith a reduced incidence of HCC among patients without cirrhosis who met treatment criteria. Cancer 2015;121:3631-8. V

INTRODUCTION
With approximately 240 million individuals with chronic infections globally, hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a leading cause of
chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).1,2 Despite widespread implementation of universal
vaccination, chronic hepatitis B (CHB) continues to be a major public health problem.
In a given patient, factors including male sex, presence of cirrhosis, diabetes, environmental exposures (eg, alcohol,
smoking, and aflatoxin), and family history affect HCC risk.3-5 In recent data, HBV-DNA levels, hepatitis B e antigen
(HBeAg) status, and HBV genotype were reported to be associated with HCC development,3 with the presence of cirrhosis and high HBV-DNA levels considered major drivers of HCC risk.3,6,7 In light of the variability of HCC risk in individual patients,8 several nomograms have been developed to assess a patient’s risk of HCC.9-11 The Risk Estimation for
Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Chronic Hepatitis B (REACH-B) model uses age, sex, HBeAg status, and serum alanine

aminotransferase (ALT) and HBV-DNA levels to estimate a patient’s HCC risk up to 10 years if untreated.10 It
was developed in patients without cirrhosis and validated
in a multicenter hospital cohort that included patients
with cirrhosis.
Several agents currently are approved for the treatment of CHB, including interferon-a and nucleos(t)ide
analogues (NA)s. Several large randomized controlled
trials have shown that antiviral therapy can lead to
improvement in serum aminotransferase levels, HBeAg
loss, hepatitis B surface antigen loss, a reduction in
HBV-DNA levels, improvement in liver histology, and
regression of cirrhosis.12,13 Anti-HBV therapy has been
associated with a reduced risk of HCC.14 However, to
the best of our knowledge, studies to date have shown
benefits limited to patients with cirrhosis, with the majority of those data derived from retrospective studies
based on patients clinically selected for antiviral therapy.
Whether antiviral therapy confers beneficial effects on
HCC in patients without cirrhosis, and how long after
treatment initiation these effects may occur, are to our
knowledge, undefined.
Ideally, a long-term placebo-controlled trial would
provide the most definitive answers regarding anti-HBV
therapy in the development of HCC. Given the wellaccepted benefits of therapy, placebo-controlled trials
would be unethical, at least in patients who are candidates for treatment according to various guidelines.
Herein, we used data from the registration trials for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) to assess the impact of
antiviral therapy on the occurrence of HCC, focusing on
patients without cirrhosis. We used the REACH-B
model to estimate the expected incidence of HCC had
trial participants not been treated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design

Data from TDF registration studies GS-US-174-0103
(HBeAg-positive; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT001168
05) and GS-US-174-0102 (HBeAg-negative; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00117676) were used.15,16 Patients provided informed consent and the study was approved by the
ethics committees of the participating institutions. Patients
aged 18 to 69 years were randomized 2:1 to receive TDF or
adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) for 48 weeks in a double-blinded
manner, followed by open-label TDF for up to 384 weeks.
Race was based on self-report. Patients were required to be
positive for hepatitis B surface antigen for 6 months before
enrollment with evidence of active HBV infection (ie,
3632

detectable HBV-DNA and elevated ALT). Patients with cirrhosis (Ishak fibrosis scores of 5 or 6) were included in the
studies. Patients with a history of HCC or prior clinical hepatic decompensation were excluded. No patient experienced hepatic decompensation during the current study.
Liver biopsies were performed at baseline and at weeks
48 and 240 and were evaluated using the Knodell and Ishak
scoring systems by a single independent pathologist blinded
to patient treatment and visit number.
Although virologic efficacy was the primary endpoint of the current study, participants continued to
receive routine care at each site, including screening, diagnosis, and treatment for HCC according to local practice
guidelines and conventions. Although HCC was not a
prespecified study endpoint, it was captured as a predefined adverse event. The current analyses are based on
data obtained at week 384.

Statistical Analysis

Standard descriptive statistics of patients by baseline cirrhosis status were conducted. Observed HCC incidence
along with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method stratified by baseline cirrhosis status.17
Predicted HCC incidence was calculated using
REACH-B,10 a Cox regression model relating HCC risk
to sex, age, ALT level, HBeAg status, and DNA level.
We obtained coefficients of the Cox model and baseline
disease-free survival at years 3, 5, and 10 from Yang
et al.10 Detailed survival estimates in yearly increments
from 1 to 10 were obtained from the REACH-B authors.
We used linear interpolation to estimate the baseline
disease-free survival for events occurring between full
calendar years.
REACH-B estimates the numbers of HCC cases as follows. The HCC-free survival probability in patient i at time
t is
Si ðtÞ5½S0i ðtÞexpðXi bÞ
in which S0i ðtÞ is the baseline survival probability for
patient i at time t, b is a vector of the coefficients from the
REACH-B model, and Xi is a vector of the baseline characteristics of the patient. Expected number of events for a
subject is

Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated as a
ratio of observed over predicted HCC cases in the studies
for particular time intervals. The 95% CIs were calculated
by Poisson regression without covariates with an offset
equal to loge (number of predicted cases).18 Exposure
time for subjects who dropped out prematurely is from
baseline to the time of dropout (ie, predicted HCC cases
reflected the number of subjects “at risk” at a given time
point and are not based on the initial sample size).
Our primary analysis compared the observed versus
predicted HCC incidence in patients without cirrhosis.
SIRs were calculated over 384 weeks, with additional sensitivity analyses of patients with cirrhosis and Asian patients,
and the exclusion of those who had HCC diagnosed during
the first calendar year of the study. We also considered
other HCC prediction models, including the CU-HCC
(Chinese University-Hepatocellular Carcinoma) and
GAG-HCC (Guide with Age, Gender, HBV DNA, Core
promoter mutations and Cirrhosis-Hepatocellular Carcinoma) risk scores to further validate our findings.9,11 Last,
we examined whether REACH-B applied to post-48-week
on-treatment data matches the observed HCC cases. SIRs
and 95% CIs were calculated as described above.

Cirrhosis was defined as an Ishak fibrosis score of 5 or 6.

RESULTS
Among 641 patients randomized and treated in studies
102 and 103, 7 individuals did not have sufficient histological data for inclusion in the current analysis. Of the
remaining 634 patients, 482 did not have cirrhosis (76%)
whereas 152 patients (24%) had cirrhosis at baseline
(Table 1).
A total of 14 HCC cases were observed. Timing and
characteristics of the HCC cases are summarized in Supporting Information Figure 2 and Table 2. Of the 14
cases, 9 patients were HBeAg negative, 6 had cirrhosis at
baseline (all Ishak fibrosis score 6), and 12 patients were
male (Supporting Information Table 1).
The annual HCC incidence in the study as a whole
was 0.37% (95% CI, 0.20%-0.62%), and was 0.65%
(95% CI, 0.24%-1.40%) among patients with cirrhosis
and 0.28% (95% CI, 0.12%-0.56%) among patients
without cirrhosis (Fig. 1). Known risk factors for HCC
such as older age, advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, and genotype C were observed when comparing those who did and
did not develop HCC, although the small number of
HCC cases reduces the power of the analysis (Table 2).
There was no indication that variables such as high HBVDNA or ALT levels influenced the incidence of HCC in
these patients treated with an effective antiviral agent.

Figure 1. Observed incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) by baseline cirrhosis status in studies 102 and 103. All
14 cases of HCC were depicted in this plot. Overall, the incidence of HCC in studies 102 and 103 was 37.0 per 10,000
person-years (0.37% per year), whereas among patients with
cirrhosis the incidence was 64.5 per 10,000 person-years
(0.65% per year) and among patients without cirrhosis, the
incidence was 28.4 per 10,000 person-years (0.28% per
year). *Asterisk indicates patients completing 384 weeks in
the study as defined by protocol; 4 of 402 patients completing week 384 did not have baseline biopsy data available.

Table 3 presents observed and predicted cases of
HCC among patients without cirrhosis. Three patients
developed HCC within the first 48 weeks of randomization. By the time the third case occurred, REACH-B predicted 1.92 HCCs to have developed, which translated to
an SIR of 1.56 (95% CI, 0.50-4.84), indicating that there
were 1.56 times more HCC cases than expected. Subsequently, the SIRs dropped below 1, indicating a lowerthan-expected HCC incidence. The SIRs progressively
decreased and by the time the eighth patient with HCC
was diagnosed, the SIR was 0.48 (95% CI, 0.24-0.96)
and was statistically significant. At the end of the 384
weeks of follow-up, 20.11 cases were predicted by the
REACH-B model compared with 8 observed cases. At
that time point, the SIR was 0.40 (95% CI, 0.20-0.80),
representing a 60% reduction in HCC incidence (Fig. 2
Top).
Table 4 compares the observed number of HCCs in
patients with cirrhosis and what would be predicted by
the REACH-B score. For the 6 HCC cases in this group
of patients, the SIR ranged from 0.69 to 1.32. It is interesting to note that there were no new HCC cases observed
in this group after the sixth patient was diagnosed around
week 192 (Fig. 2 Bottom). As of the end of the follow-up
(week 384), the SIR was 0.51 (95% CI, 0.23-1.14),
although it was not statistically significant.
Because the diagnosis of cirrhosis in the REACH-B
study was made on clinical grounds rather than via a liver
biopsy, we also considered using laboratory data to define

analyses in the current study were based on histological
definitions of cirrhosis (Ishak fibrosis scores of 5 of 6).
When a platelet count <1503103/lL or serum total bilirubin >2 mg/dL was used as a surrogate criteria for cirrhosis, greater than two-thirds of patients with cirrhosis
(108 of 152 patients) were misclassified as not having cirrhosis, whereas <10% of patients without cirrhosis (43 of
482 patients) were categorized as having cirrhosis. If these
laboratory criteria were used to exclude cirrhosis, the SIR
in patients without cirrhosis would be 0.22 (95% CI,
0.10-0.50).
We conducted a sensitivity analysis of the 189 Asian
patients (148 patients without cirrhosis, 39 patients with
cirrhosis, and 2 with nonevaluable biopsies). During the
follow-up, 6 patients developed HCC. At baseline, 1
patient had cirrhosis and 5 did not. The sixth case was
diagnosed at 6.1 years of follow-up (SIR, 0.81; 95% CI,
0.36-1.81). At week 384, the SIR was reduced to 0.66
(95% CI, 0.30-1.48), indicating that the effect of TDF
among Asian patients is in the same direction as the overall population, whereas the small number of events likely
precluded statistical significance.
Results of a similar analysis among non-Asian
patients are shown in Supporting Information Table 3.
In another sensitivity analysis (Supporting Information Table 4), we excluded patients who developed HCC
during the first year of study, because it is likely that these
tumors represented prevalent cases at the time of study
enrollment. As expected, this reduced the SIRs; at week

Figure 2. Observed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases
versus predicted HCC incidence over time among patients
(Top) without and (Bottom) with cirrhosis. (Top) The 8 cases
of HCC observed (dots) in patients without cirrhosis were
plotted against the predicted incidence of HCC (hashed line)
using the Risk Estimation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma in
Chronic Hepatitis B (REACH-B) algorithm over 384 weeks. At
the time the eighth HCC case was observed, the standardized
incidence ratio was 0.48 (95% confidence interval, 0.2410.963). At the end of the 384 weeks, the standardized incidence ratio was 0.40 (95% confidence interval, 0.199-0.795),
representing a 60% reduction in the incidence of HCC. (Bottom) The 6 cases of HCC observed (dots) among patients
with cirrhosis were plotted against the predicted incidence of
HCC (hashed line) using the REACH-B algorithm over 384
weeks. There were no additional cases observed after the
case that occurred around week 192.

384, the SIR was 0.25 (95% CI, 0.10-0.60) in patients
without cirrhosis and was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.18-1.03) in
patients with cirrhosis.
A third sensitivity analysis considered the CU-HCC
and GAG-HCC models to predict HCC occurrence
(Supporting Information Table 5). The CU-HCC model
classified 283 patients as being at low risk, 128 as being at
intermediate risk, and 61 as being at high risk, predicting
22.5 HCC cases to occur by year 5. In comparison, we
observed 13 HCC cases at year 5 in the current study. The
GAG-HCC model categorized 356 patients as being at

low risk and 116 as being at high risk. It predicted 20.9
cases by year 5. Thus, the 2 models were consistent in suggesting that the risk of HCC in the patients in the current
study was reduced by approximately one-third.
Supporting Information Table 2 examines the
REACH-B prediction using on-treatment data. In studies
102 and 103, both HBV-DNA and ALT levels were
greatly affected during the first 48 weeks of therapy. At
week 48, the mean change in HBV-DNA was -5.20 log10
IU/mL (Wilcoxon signed rank, P<.001) in patients
treated with TDF and -3.96 log10 IU/mL (P<.001) in
patients treated with ADV, with no differences noted
between patients with and without cirrhosis (-4.81 log10
IU/mL vs -4.71 log10 IU/mL, respectively; Wilcoxon
rank sum, P 5 .38). ALT was significantly reduced in
both groups, with 78.3% of patients treated with TDF
and 72.6% of patients treated with ADV achieving normal ALT (Fisher exact test, P 5 .13). The percentage of
patients with normal ALT at week 48 was also similar
between patients with and without cirrhosis (71.5% and
78.4%, respectively; P 5 .09). HBeAg status was also significantly affected by antiviral therapy (percentage of
HBeAg-positive patients: 41.5% at baseline vs 30.5% at
week 48; P<.001). Obviously, the remaining parameters
in the REACH B model, age and sex, were not affected by
antiviral therapy. Using week 48 on-treatment data, the
REACH-B model grossly underestimated the number of
HCC cases. SIRs ranged between 1.91 and 3.89 for
patients without cirrhosis, indicating that the prediction
using on-treatment data underestimates the actual incidence by approximately 2-fold to 4-fold (Supporting
3635

Original Article

Information Table 2). The magnitude of underestimation
was even more dramatic in patients with cirrhosis (SIR
range, 3.46-143.51).
DISCUSSION
Understanding the impact of antiviral therapy on HCC
incidence in patients with CHB is important for both
individual patient management and public health policy.
The results of the current study demonstrate that HCC
incidence in patients without cirrhosis treated with TDF
was lower than expected. The effects of TDF became noticeable at approximately 2 years of therapy and eventually
reached a SIR of 0.40, or a 60% reduction in incidence by
week 384. Subsequent sensitivity analyses replicated the
overall trend, further supporting the observation that
TDF therapy is associated with HCC risk reduction.
HCC remains the most dreaded complication in
patients with CHB. A major recent advance in our understanding of the natural history of HBV infection is the
relation between serum HBV-DNA concentration and
future risk of HCC.7 This discovery was made in the Risk
Evaluation of Viral Load Elevation and Associated
Liver Disease/Cancer-Hepatitis B Virus (REVEAL-HBV)
study, which prospectively followed a community-based
cohort of untreated patients with HBV infection in Taiwan.7 Derived from this cohort, the REACH-B model
estimates HCC risk in patients without clinical evidence
of cirrhosis.10 It was subsequently validated in an external
cohort from 3 hospitals located in Asia, including 18.4%
of patients with cirrhosis.10 To the best of our knowledge,
the accuracy of models such as REACH-B in non-Asian
populations is not established. A recent study of entecavir
use on HCC reported low discriminatory performance in
white individuals.19 However, another study has suggested that the REACH-B model was accurate in a large
North American cohort of patients with CHB with different genotypes.20
After initial data that suggested interferon therapy
was associated with a reduced risk of HCC,21 subsequent
studies evaluated the effect of long-term NAs on HCC
incidence. In what to our knowledge is the only randomized controlled trial conducted to date, lamivudine and
placebo were compared in treatment-naive patients with
advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis and active hepatitis.22 After a
mean treatment of approximately 3 years, lamivudine
reduced the risk of HCC by 51%. Several nonrandomized
studies, including a recent US study in a geographically
and racially diverse study population, have shown a similar degree of risk reduction (ie, approximately 50%).23
Another recent study demonstrated a benefit for NA

therapy in the postoperative prognosis of patients with
HBV-related HCC.24 Compared with these recent observational studies, the data from the current study are
unique in that they were prospectively collected in a rigorous trial setting. The current study data also included
baseline histological data to specifically identify patients
without cirrhosis. Our results remained robust when cirrhosis was defined by surrogate clinical indicators, emulating the method by which REACH-B and other models
were developed. Because the detection of cirrhosis in routine practice is neither sensitive nor standardized, noninvasive measurements of liver fibrosis by modalities such as
transient elastography may help to enhance the accuracy
of these models.
Cirrhosis is well established as a strong risk factor for
HCC. It is likely that a part of the HCC risk reduction by
antiviral therapy is associated with regression of fibrosis and
cirrhosis, which have been demonstrated with long-term
NA therapy.12 In the data from the current study, HCC
risk reduction was more pronounced in patients without
cirrhosis, which suggests that suppression of viral replication has a direct impact on hepatic carcinogenesis independent of its effect on fibrosis. The current study data in
patients with cirrhosis must be considered with caution for
several reasons. First, the REACH-B model, based on
patients without overt evidence of cirrhosis, most likely
underestimates the incidence of HCC in patients with cirrhosis. One potential interpretation of our data may be that
TDF therapy reduced the risk of HCC in patients with cirrhosis at least to the level expected in patients without cirrhosis. Second, it is likely that a longer observation may
demonstrate continued HCC risk reduction.
The full impact of antiviral inhibition on HBVrelated oncogenesis remains uncertain. Clearly, with
potent NA therapy, HBV-DNA and ALT levels change
promptly. Our 48-week on-therapy data suggest that
HCC risk reduction did not parallel the rapid decrease in
HBV-DNA or ALT and that it takes >1 year of therapy
for the risk to be altered significantly. The data from the
current study support a recent observational study that
reported that risk scores decline during therapy and that
the scores at baseline or after 1 year of therapy did not predict HCC incidence well,19 although not all studies
agree.25 Ultimately, patients with active hepatitis meeting
antiviral therapy indication remain at an increased risk of
HCC, even when compared with those with inactive disease.26 Clinicians and patients must remain vigilant
regarding HCC surveillance in accordance with standard
guidelines and taking into account individual risk factors,

even when appropriate HBV-DNA suppression and ALT
normalization are achieved.27,28
There are limitations to the current study. Statistical
power to demonstrate the desired effect of TDF therapy
was limited by the small number of HCC cases despite the
study’s large denominator, which in and of itself is a result
of TDF therapy substantially reducing HCC incidence.
This limited our ability to conduct subgroup analysis. In
the strictest sense, REACH-B is only applicable in Asian
patients without cirrhosis. We reported only 5 Asian
patients without cirrhosis who developed HCC. Although
the sensitivity analysis of Asian patients without cirrhosis
was not statistically significant, this and prior studies,
including our analysis using the CU-HCC and GAGHCC models, demonstrated a consistent effect of therapy,
with an approximately one-third reduction in HCC. Second, HCC was not a predefined endpoint of the current
study, and rather, was considered to be an adverse event.
Although it is possible that the rigor with which HCC
cases were reported may not have been as high as primary
endpoints, there is no evidence in the current study to suggest systematic flaws in the diagnosis of HCC itself. We
made random inquiries to select study sites to verify the
practice of reporting HCC cases. There were no aberrant
instances that would cause us to question the validity of an
HCC diagnosis. Third, patients enrolled in clinical trials
tend to have earlier stages of liver disease with lower risks
of HCC, although approximately one-quarter of the individuals enrolled in the current study had cirrhosis (Ishak
fibrosis score of 5 or 6) at baseline. However, the lack of
an untreated control group makes this point difficult to
evaluate.
The observed incidence of HCC in patients without
cirrhosis who were treated with TDF was lower than that
expected based on a well-validated prediction model, suggesting the benefits of antiviral therapy in reducing HCC
beyond its impact on prevention and regression of fibrosis
and cirrhosis. Although these are encouraging data for
patients being treated with TDF, they must not be extrapolated to patients who do not meet current treatment criteria. Finally, HCC prediction models should not be
applied using on-therapy data because they underestimate
HCC incidence. Patients should continue to be monitored for HCC, following established guidelines, regardless of therapeutic response.
