Optimizing Therapy for Patients With
Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia in
Chronic Phase

Identification of BCR-ABL as the defining leukemogenic event in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) revolutionized
the treatment of the disease. Imatinib, a potent BCR-ABL inhibitor, is the standard of care for the first-line treatment
of patients with chronic-phase CML because of its high long-term response rates and favorable tolerability profile
compared with previous standard therapies. However, resistance to imatinib develops in 2% to 4% of patients annually. For patients with acquired cytogenetic resistance to standard-dose imatinib (400 mg daily), imatinib dose escalation (600-800 mg daily) is an excellent first option for managing patients and achieving cytogenetic responses.
However, for patients with primary resistance to imatinib, hematologic disease recurrence, or emergent BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations, imatinib dose escalation may not be sufficient to control the disease. For these patients, the
potent second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors dasatinib and nilotinib are available. Both agents provide effective therapeutic options for patients with imatinib resistance or intolerance. For the current overview, the authors
reviewed the data supporting the use of both dasatinib and nilotinib in imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant
patients, and they have highlighted the future of CML therapy. Overall, the article is intended to offer physicians a
comprehensive review of the current literature and to provide data supporting various treatment options for patients

Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), which accounts for 15% of adult leukemias in Western countries, can occur

at any age, although the incidence of the disease increases with age.1 CML is characterized by a translocation that involves
fusion of the Abelson oncogene (ABL) located on chromosome 9q34 with the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) on chromosome 22q11.2. The reciprocal translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) results in a shortened chromosome 22 called the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, 22q-, which encodes the cytoplasmic fusion protein BCR-ABL. This protein has constitutive
tyrosine kinase activity, which stimulates hematopoietic transformation.2-7 Various translocation breakpoints and differential messenger RNA splicing result in different isoforms of BCR-ABL associated with specific leukemia types (Fig. 1).3,8
The predominant isoform of BCR-ABL is a 210-kDa protein that is present in >90% of patients with CML.8

Use of Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitors for the Treatment of CML
Imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib all are approved BCR-ABL inhibitors for use in the treatment of patients with CML.
However, all 3 inhibit tyrosine kinases other than BCR-ABL. Imatinib targets BCR-ABL, ABL, ABL-related gene (ARG)
product, C-kit receptor (KIT), the platelet-derived growth factor receptors alpha (PDGFRa) and PDGFRb, and colonystimulating factor 1 receptor (c-FMS).9-13 Dasatinib targets several kinases, including BCR-ABL, ABL, ephrin type-A receptor 2 (EPHA2), KIT, PDGFR, and sarcoma (Src) family members14; whereas nilotinib inhibits BCR-ABL, ABL,
ARG, KIT, and PDGFR (Table 1).15,16

Imatinib is the standard of care for first-line treatment of
chronic-phase CML (CML-CP) because of its high longterm response rates and favorable tolerability profile compared with previous standard therapies. Imatinib, as an

effective inhibitor of BCR-ABL, targets a key initiation
event in the development of CML (Fig. 2).17-19
After phase 1 studies,18,19 a phase 2 study of imatinib was initiated in 532 interferon alpha (IFN)-resistant/
refractory patients who had late-phase CML-CP.20 Imatinib was associated with high response rates: A major cytogenetic response (MCyR) was observed in 67% of
patients, a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) was in
observed in 57% of patients, and a complete hematologic
response (CHR) was observed in 96% of patients. Imatinib also conferred survival benefits, with 6-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates of
61% and 76%, respectively. Imatinib also was well tolerated, as serious grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) were
uncommon, occurring in <5% of patients. At the 6-year
cutoff, 255 patients (56%) discontinued the study: Eight
percent discontinued treatment because of AEs.
The superiority of imatinib over IFN was established in the phase 3 International Randomized Study of
Interferon and STI571 (IRIS) trial.21,22 In that study,
1106 treatment-naive patients with CML-CP were
randomized to receive either imatinib 400 mg daily or
IFN plus cytarabine (n ¼ 553 patients each).22 At 18
months, an MCyR was achieved in 87% of patients who
received imatinib compared with 35% of patients who
received IFN (P < .001). Most imatinib-treated patients
experienced a CCyR (76.2% vs 14.5% with IFN;

P < .001). A major molecular responses (MMR), defined
as a decrease 3-log in BCR-ABL transcripts compared
with a standardized baseline value, occurred in 39% of
imatinib-treated patients versus 2% of IFN-treated
patients (P < .001) (Fig. 3).21 The MMR rate was higher
in patients who achieved a CCyR (57% for imatinib vs
24% for IFN; P ¼ .003). After 6 years of imatinib therapy, long-term response rates remained high.23,24 Of the
456 patients who achieved a CCyR on imatinib therapy,
325 patients (71%) were still on study treatment and
maintained a CCyR at 6 years. From Year 1 to Year 6, the
annual event rate (loss of CHR, loss of MCyR, progression to accelerated phase/blast crisis [AP/BC], or death)
on imatinib decreased over time (3.3%, 7.5%, 4.8%,
1.7%, 0.8%, and 0.4% for Years 1-6, respectively).23
There was a downward trend in the risk of disease
progression on imatinib, with a 0.4% event rate (including loss of response) and a 0% rate of transformation to
AP/BC between Years 5 and 6. Approximately 83% of
patients were event-free, and 93% were free of progression
to AP or BC at 6 years on imatinib treatment. The estimated 6-year survival rate for all patients who received
imatinib as initial therapy was 88%, and the rate was 95%
for CML-related deaths only. The 6-year PFS (without
progression to AP/BC) occurred in 97% of patients who

achieved a CCyR within 6 months compared with 80%
of patients without a CCyR at this early time point (P <
.001) (Fig. 4). The IRIS study demonstrated that, in addition to its efficacy advantages, imatinib was tolerated better than high-dose IFN.22 Grade 3/4 AEs, including
fatigue, depression, myalgias, arthralgias, neutropenia,
and thrombocytopenia, were more common in the IFN
arm. AEs in the imatinib arm were mostly grade 1 or 2.
The most common grade 3/4 AEs among the patients
who received imatinib were neutropenia (14%), thrombocytopenia (8%), anemia (3%), and elevated liver
enzymes (5%). These AEs were not cumulative and
decreased over time, occurring mostly in Years 1 and 2,
and the rates decreased to <2% after Year 4.25 Typically,
severe cytopenias can be managed effectively in patients
who receive imatinib 400 mg daily by temporary withdrawal of imatinib. After resolution of the cytopenia, imatinib may be restarted at a lower dose of 300 mg daily and,
if tolerated, imatinib 400 mg daily can be resumed. However, if cytopenia persists and has an adverse impact on
the course of imatinib therapy, then nilotinib or dasatinib
may be used as alternative treatment options for these
patients.
Follow-up at 6 years revealed that imatinib has a
favorable long-term safety profile.23 No new serious AEs
were identified between Years 5 and Year 6. Furthermore,
first-line treatment with imatinib did not affect later

success on salvage therapies (IFN, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]).26,27 The survival
benefits of imatinib could not be determined in the IRIS
study because of the high rate of patient crossover, but
they were confirmed by historic comparison studies.28,29
A retrospective comparison of newly diagnosed patients
with CML who received imatinib (n ¼ 279) or IFN (n ¼
650) at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer
Center (MDACC) demonstrated improved response and
survival for imatinib-treated patients.28 CCyR rates were
87% for imatinib-treated patients versus 28% for IFNtreated patients (P < .001). Survival was correlated with
cytogenetic response for both imatinib and IFN, suggesting that the survival benefits of imatinib were a result of
the high cytogenetic response rates induced by this drug.
The estimated 5-year survival rate was significantly higher
(88%) for imatinib-treated patients compared with IFNtreated patients (63% P ¼ .001). The benefits of imatinib
were observed in all prognostic risk groups. Another retrospective study that examined outcomes from the imatinib
arm of the IRIS trial and the IFN/cytarabine arm of the
CML91 trial was in complete concordance with the
MDACC study.29 The safety, response, and survival
advantages of imatinib over IFN has led to broad acceptance of imatinib as the drug of choice for initial therapy
of CML.21-23
Assessing imatinib response and resistance

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network
(NCCN) and the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) recommend similar monitoring schedules for patients who are
treated with imatinib.1,30,31 When a patient initiates treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), bone marrow
cytogenetics should be measured every 6 months until a
CCyR is achieved and then every 1 to 3 years as long as
MMR is stable. BCR-ABL transcript levels should be
monitored at least every 3 months and every 3 to 6
months once a CCyR is reached.31 To assess MMR, major
guidelines recommend determining BCR-ABL transcript
levels every 3 months to 6 months using real-time, reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis and should be expressed according to an international
scale.31 In patients with rising BCR-ABL levels, transcript
testing may be performed more frequently, and BCRABL mutation analysis may be considered. Definitions of
imatinib response are provided in Table 2.30 Updated
ELN recommendations have been elaborated. Updated
NCCN guidelines are available now, and physicians
should use either the updated ELN or NCCN documents

as resources for the management of their patients moving
forward.
There is debate over the definition of ‘‘rising’’ transcript levels and the threshold at which such a rise should
constitute a change in therapy. A 2-fold increase in BCRABL transcript levels has been associated with detectable
BCR-ABL mutations.31 Some investigators advocate
mutational analysis for patients who experience a 2-fold
to 10-fold rise in BCR-ABL transcript levels by quantitative PCR.32 In a prospective study of 90 patients who had
CML in CCyR on imatinib, an increase in BCR-ABL
RNA levels >3.2-fold was a significant predictor of disease recurrence and may be an appropriate threshold for
considering a change in therapy.33 Conversely, in a more
recent study, Kantarjian et al observed that, for most
patients in CCyR during imatinib therapy, a rising transcript level did not generally increase the risk of progression.32 Only those patients who lost an MMR or who
never achieved an MMR were at increased risk for disease
progression when transcript levels increased more than 1log as determined by PCR.
In all instances of rising transcript levels, it is important to determine whether the patient was fully compliant
with their imatinib therapy. Imatinib trough blood level
concentrations at 4 weeks into therapy have been associated with outcome.34 Imatinib blood level testing also
may be useful when a patient does not achieve or has lost
an optimal response, exhibits signs of potential drug-drug
interactions, or is experiencing unusually severe side

effects. However, the results of individual imatinib blood
level tests should be considered with caution, because they
may not be a true reflection of long-term imatinib blood
levels and, thus, may not necessarily have an impact on
the course of therapy.
Resistance to imatinib developed in 2% to 4% of
patients annually. In the IRIS trial, the estimated annual
event rate after the start of imatinib therapy was 3.3% in
the first year, 7.5% in the second year, 4.8% in the third
year, 1.5% in the fourth year, 0.8% in the fifth year, and
0.4% in the sixth year.23 The most common cause of secondary imatinib resistance is point mutations in BCRABL that prevent effective binding of imatinib but may
retain kinase activity.35-39 These mutations are clustered
primarily within the kinase domain of BCR-ABL (ABL
exons 4-10).40 They exhibit differential relative resistance
to imatinib in vitro.36 Representatives of high-level resistance mutations are Y253F/H or E255K/V.36 Mutation
T315I has no residual sensitivity to imatinib and also confers resistance to second-generation TKIs.15,41 Mutations
associated with intermediate resistance include M244V,
M351T, H396P/R, and F359V.42 High-dose imatinib
may prevent the development of mutations that confer
imatinib resistance.43
The prognostic impact of BCR-ABL mutations is
difficult to determine, and routine mutational analysis is
not recommended currently in the absence of treatment
failure or suboptimal response.40,44,45 Suboptimal imatinib response, for instance, may be caused by BCR-ABL–
independent factors, such as lack of compliance with
long-term therapy. The NCCN and the ELN recommend
continuation of standard-dose imatinib or dose escalation
to 600 mg or 800 mg daily in patients who have a suboptimal response.1,30 Treatment options for patients without
an adequate response to imatinib include high-dose imatinib, a second-generation TKI (such as nilotinib or dasatinib), a clinical trial, or allogeneic HSCT.1,30
High-dose imatinib

On the basis of the IRIS results, the recommended
starting dose of imatinib is 400 mg once daily. However,
higher doses currently are being investigated in previously
treated, slowly responding patients; patients with loss of
response; and populations with treatment-naive CML. In
a study of patients with recurrent/refractory CML-CP, a
dose increase of imatinib to 800 mg daily led to a CHR in
65% of patients, and 56% of patients who previously
were unresponsive to 400 mg daily achieved a CCyR or a
partial cytogenetic response.46 Several other studies have

Cancer

March 15, 2010

confirmed the efficacy of high-dose imatinib (600 mg or
800 mg daily) in patients who had suboptimal responses
to standard-dose imatinib. Investigators at MDACC evaluated long-term efficacy in 84 patients with CML-CP
who had dose escalation on imatinib.47
At a median follow-up of 61 months, 69% of patients
remained alive. A CCyR was achieved in 34 patients
(40%), including 33 of 63 patients (52%) with cytogenetic
failure and 1 of 21 patients (5%) with hematologic failure.
Responses were long lasting: An MCyR lasted a median of
5 years. The 3-year event-free and OS rates were 47% and
76%, respectively. Another evaluation of 23 patients with
CML-CP who received imatinib dose escalations for cytogenetic or molecular suboptimal responses to standard
doses of imatinib supported these findings.48 All 10
patients who had a cytogenetic suboptimal response
obtained a CCyR after a median of 4 months on high-dose
imatinib, and 5 of 13 patients (38%) who had a suboptimal
molecular response achieved an MMR after a median follow-up of 11 months. A retrospective analysis of dose escalation among patients who were randomized to receive
first-line imatinib in the IRIS trial demonstrated that many
patients can achieve improved, durable responses with an
increased dose of imatinib.49 Among the 33 patients who
met IRIS criteria for dose escalation, 17 patients (52%)
achieved the clinical hematologic or cytogenetic response
that they failed to achieve or previously lost. Nine of those
patients (27%) achieved an MCyR. Thus, imatinib dose
escalation can restore sustained molecular and cytogenetic
responses in patients with failure or suboptimal response to
standard-dose imatinib.
High-dose imatinib also has demonstrated high
cytogenetic and molecular response rates in patients with
newly diagnosed CML-CP. In a cohort of 114 newly diagnosed patients who received 800 mg daily imatinib, highdose imatinib was associated with improved rates of
CCyR (P ¼ .0005), MMR (P ¼ .00001), and complete
molecular response (P ¼ .001) compared with a historic
control group that received standard-dose imatinib.43 A
phase 2 dose-escalation study in imatinib-naive patients
who were started on 600 mg daily and increased to 800
mg daily if response criteria were not met further demonstrated CCyR and MMR rates that exceeded those of the
IRIS trial.50
These promising results prompted the initiation of
several prospective randomized trials evaluating high-dose
imatinib in newly diagnosed patients. The randomized
phase 3 Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Optimization and Selectivity (TOPS) study evaluated 400 mg (standard-dose

imatinib [SD-IM]) versus 800 mg (high-dose imatinib
[HD-IM]) in patients with newly diagnosed, previously
untreated CML-CP. The primary endpoint of the trial
was the MMR rate at 12 months. Preliminary results from
the study indicated that the CCyR was significantly better
at 6 months with HD-IM (45% SD-IM vs 57% HD-IM;
P ¼ .0146), but there was no statistical difference in
CCyR at 12 months (66% SD-IM vs 70% HD-IM).51
MMR rates were higher with HD-IM at 3 months and 6
months compared with SD-IM (12% vs 3% at 3 months,
P ¼ .0011; 34% vs 17% at 6 months, P ¼ .0002)
although no difference in the MMR rate at 12 months
was observed (46% vs 40%; P ¼ .20). However, there was
a trend toward improved MMR at 12 months in patients
who had high Sokal risk scores (26% SD-IM vs 41% HDIM; P ¼ .16).51 The ELN also performed a randomized
study of standard-dose imatinib (400 mg daily) versus
high-dose imatinib (800 mg daily) as front-line therapy
for patients with high Sokal risk CML-CP in which the
CCyR rate at 12 months was the primary endpoint.52
There was no difference in the CCyR rate at 12 months in
the intention-to-treat analysis. CCyR was correlated with
mean daily dose, where the rate of CCyR was 86% among
patients who received a median daily imatinib dose of 600
mg to 800 mg compared with 66% for patients who
received a median daily dose <600 mg (P ¼ .013).
Other potential dosing strategies for imatinib currently are being explored. An ongoing phase 3 study is comparing SD-IM (400 mg daily) versus induction with HDIM (800 mg daily) for 6 months, followed by a dose reduction to SD-IM in pretreated patients.53 Early results indicate that significantly more patients who received HD-IM
induction followed by maintenance achieved an MCyR
than patients who received SD-IM at 12 weeks and 24
weeks (P ¼ .01 and P ¼ .009, respectively). Furthermore,
more patients on HD-IM achieved a CCyR at 12 weeks,
24 weeks, and 48 weeks (12 weeks: 6.2% vs 24.5%; P <
.001; 24 weeks: 20% vs 44%; P < .001; 48 weeks: 37% vs
48%, nonsignificant). High-dose imatinib was associated
with higher rates of AEs, including grade 3/4 anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia,53,54 along with rash, diarrhea, myalgia, superficial edema, and dyspnea.54
For nontrial patients who have CML-CP, the recommended starting dose of imatinib should be 400 mg
daily based on long-term data from the IRIS trial and on
confirmatory data from the TOPS study.24,51 It has been
demonstrated that imatinib 800 mg daily is an effective
strategy for overcoming resistance to imatinib 400 mg
daily and can be tolerated long-term, as demonstrated in

1424

the studies of imatinib dose escalation from the IRIS and
MDACC studies and from the TOPS study.47,49,51
Second-Generation TKIs
Nilotinib

Nilotinib is a derivative of imatinib that is highly
selective against ABL. It is 30-fold more potent than imatinib at inhibiting BCR-ABL in vitro.15,55 Nilotinib also
inhibits ARG, KIT, PDGFR-a, and PDGFR-b15 but
does not affect Src, fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT-3),
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, or epidermal
growth factor receptor kinases. Nilotinib is active against
most imatinib-resistant mutants except T315I in both cell
culture and murine models.15,55,56
In a dose-ranging (50 mg once daily to 600 mg twice
daily) phase 1 study in 119 patients with imatinib-resistant CML, nilotinib demonstrated activity in all phases of
CML.57 Eleven of 12 patients who had CML-CP (92%)
had a CHR. Thirty-three of 46 patients (72%) who had
CML-AP had a hematologic response, and 22 patients
(48%) had a cytogenetic response; 13 of 33 patients
(39%) with CML-BC had a hematologic response, and 9
patients (27%) had a cytogenetic response. Responses
were comparable among patients with or without BCRABL mutations. Results from that phase 1 study led to the
recommended dose of 400 mg twice daily.
Approval of nilotinib was based on a phase 2 trial of
patients with imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant
CML in all phases. Among patients with CML-CP (N ¼
321; 71% imatinib resistant and 29% imatinib intolerant),58,59 158 of 206 patients (77%) who did not have a
CHR at baseline achieved a CHR during nilotinib therapy. An MCyR was noted in 186 patients (59%), and
44% achieved a CCyR. Most of those patients (84%)
maintained an MCyR for >18 months, and the response
was rapid (median time to MCyR, 2.8 months). The 18month survival rate was 91%.
Nilotinib also has demonstrated activity in patients
who failed both prior imatinib and prior dasatinib.60
Among 37 evaluable patients with CML-CP, 81%
achieved a CHR with nilotinib therapy, 38% achieved an
MCyR, and 18% achieved a CCyR.
Nilotinib has a favorable overall tolerability profile.57 Nilotinib was associated with very low rates of pleural or pericardial effusions (approximately 1; none have
been grade 3/4).58 The most common grade 3/4 AEs associated with nilotinib therapy were thrombocytopenia
(20%-33%), neutropenia (13%-31%), elevated bilirubin
(7%), and elevated serum lipase (5%-15%).57,58,61 Food

foods that are known to inhibit hepatic metabolic pathways like CYP3A4 should be avoided. Patients with baseline corrected QT (QTc) prolongation should not receive
nilotinib, and medications that prolong the QTc interval
should be avoided on nilotinib therapy.
Low rates of cross intolerance with imatinib have
been reported in nilotinib-treated patients.63 Only 1% of
patients with imatinib intolerance caused by nonhematologic AEs experienced a recurrence of similar grade 3/4
AEs during nilotinib therapy and did not lead to dose
reductions or discontinuations. Of 39 patients who had
imatinib intolerance because of hematologic AEs, only 7
(18%) discontinued nilotinib therapy because of a recurrence of similar grade 3/4 AEs; all occurred in patients with
CML-CP who experienced intolerable thrombocytopenia.
In a recent subanalysis of a phase 2 study of nilotinib
treatment in patients with CML-CP that compared those
with and without a baseline mutation, the response to
nilotinib did not differ statistically between the 2
groups.64 Only patients who harbored BCR-ABL mutations with lower sensitivity to nilotinib in vitro (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] >150 nM) had less
favorable responses, and 13%, 43%, and 9% of patients
who harbored the Y253H, E255V/K, and F359V/C
mutations achieved an MCyR, respectively. No patients
who had these baseline mutations achieved a CCyR.
Thus, imatinib-resistant patients with BCR-ABL mutations benefit from nilotinib therapy except perhaps
patients with Y253H, E255V/K, F359V/C, and T315I
mutations. Approximately 20% of patients had newly detectable BCR-ABL mutations during nilotinib therapy,
and this appeared to be more frequent in patients who
had baseline mutations (30%) compared with those who
had no baseline mutation (11%).
Dasatinib

Dasatinib is an ABL kinase inhibitor that binds the
active conformation of the ABL kinase domain and also
targets similarly structured Src family kinases. There has
been debate and there is conflicting evidence regarding its
ability to also bind the inactive confirmation.65,66 Dasatinib is approximately 300 times more active than imatinib
in vitro toward unmutated BCR-ABL.41 Dasatinib inhibits all imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutants except
T315I41 and possibly F317L.67,68 It inhibits PDGFRs
and KIT more potently than imatinib or nilotinib and

Cancer

March 15, 2010

also inhibits the ephrin receptor tyrosine kinases68 and the
Src family kinases.69
Results from phase 2 trials led to the approval of
dasatinib in the United States, the European Union, and
other regions for use in imatinib-resistant CML.70-73 In
SRC/ABL Tyrosine Kinase Inhibition Activity Research
Trial C (or the START-C trial), dasatinib was administered at 70 mg twice daily to 387 patients who had CMLCP and resistance (n ¼ 288) or intolerance (n ¼ 99) to
imatinib.70 After a median follow-up of 15.2 months,
91% of patients achieved a CHR, 59% achieved an
MCyR, and 49% achieved a CCyR. Responses to dasatinib were durable, and 97% of patients who achieved an
MCyR maintained this response at 18 months. Survival
rates were noteworthy, with PFS and OS rates of 90% and
96%, respectively.
Grade 3/4 hematologic toxicities in the phase 2
study of patients with imatinib-resistant or imatinibintolerant CML-CP were thrombocytopenia (48%), anemia (22%), neutropenia (49%), and leukopenia (27%).70
Dasatinib also was associated with grade 3/4 nonhematologic AEs, including pleural effusion in 6% of patients.70
To minimize dasatinib-related toxicity while maintaining
efficacy, a dose-optimization study was initiated.74 In that
phase 3 trial, 670 patients with imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant CML-CP were randomized to receive 1
of 4 doses of dasatinib: 100 mg once daily, 50 mg twice
daily, 140 mg once daily, or 70 mg twice daily. Patients
who received dasatinib once daily (100 mg once daily)
achieved an MCyR rate comparable to that achieved by
patients who received dasatinib twice daily (70 mg twice
daily). It is noteworthy that the rates of grade 3/4 hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities, including pleural
effusions, were decreased with 100 mg once-daily dasatinib dosing.74 Currently, a once-daily dose of 100 mg is
approved for patients with CML-CP based on these findings. Dasatinib at 70 mg twice daily and 140 mg once
daily currently are dosing options for patients with CMLAP and CML-BC. The once-daily dosing of dasatinib in
patients with CML-AP and CML-BC produced comparable rates of hematologic and cytogenetic response.75,76
Patients with baseline QTc prolongation should be
treated with caution on dasatinib therapy.
The efficacy of dasatinib in patients with CML-CP
who failed prior imatinib does not appear to be compromised in patients who have BCR-ABL mutations after
imatinib therapy.77 After 2 years of follow-up, response
rates were similar in patients with a mutation compared
with those without a mutation. Only patients who

1425

Review Article

harbored mutations that had low sensitivity to dasatinib
in vitro (IC50 >3 nM; including Q252H, E255K/V,
V299L, and F317L) had lower response rates (MCyR,
34%; CCyR, 25%) compared with patients who harbored
mutations that had greater sensitivity to dasatinib (IC50
3 nM; MCyR, 58%; CCyR, 47%). Thus, imatinib-resistant patients with BCR-ABL mutations may benefit
from dasatinib therapy, except perhaps patients with
Q252H, V299L, F317L, and T315I mutations.
Currently, physicians must choose between nilotinib and dasatinib for patients with resistance to imatinib
in the absence of head-to-head trials comparing these 2
agents. Thus, decisions on which agent to choose must be
based on the individual patient. Overall, the efficacy of
these agents is comparable for patients with CML-CP
who are resistant to imatinib. A minority of patients with
imatinib resistance may harbor BCR-ABL mutations that
are less sensitive to either nilotinib or dasatinib.64,77 For
patients with T315I mutations, a clinical trial or allogeneic stem cell transplantation should be considered. However, the majority of patients, regardless of mutation
status, will be candidates for effective therapy with either
agent. The other critical factor to consider when choosing
therapy is the overall safety profile of the agent as well as
the patient’s preexisting conditions. For example, patients
with a history of pulmonary disease might be suited better
for nilotinib therapy, whereas patients with a history of
severe pancreatitis may be suited better for dasatinib therapy. Overall, the final choice of therapy should be tailored
to the individual patient.
The Future of CML Therapy
Possibly the most promising future developments in
CML therapy will be the use of second-generation TKIs,
such as nilotinib or dasatinib, in the front-line setting.
Nilotinib treatment (800 mg daily) is being assessed in
patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP in several
ongoing studies. In a study that is being conducted at
MDACC, a CCyR was achieved in 97% of patients
within 6 months of therapy and 50% of patients achieved
an MMR by 6 months of therapy. Both CCyRs and
MMRs were maintained for 12 months.78 In another
study, the Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche
dell’Adulto (GIMEMA) CML Working Party reported a
97% CCyR rate on nilotinib by 6 months and an MMR
rate of 75%.79 Dasatinib also has been evaluated as frontline therapy in a phase 2 study that is being conducted at
MDACC. At 6 months, the rate of CCyR was 94%, and
the MMR rate was 36%.80 Although these data are prom-

1426

ising, the use of second-generation TKIs in patients with
newly diagnosed CML-CP cannot be recommended until
the results of ongoing phase 3 studies of nilotinib versus
imatinib and dasatinib versus imatinib have been
reported.
Other TKIs are currently in development for CML.
Bosutinib is a dual inhibitor of both the ABL and Src kinases.81-83 Bosutinib is more active than imatinib in vitro
and has minimal activity against PDGFR or c-kit.84,85 In
preliminary data from the phase 2 portion of a phase 1/2
study investigating bosutinib in patients with CML-CP
and resistance or intolerance to imatinib, 75 of 96 evaluable patients (78%) achieved a CHR, 47 of 106 (44%)
achieved an MCyR, and 35 (33%) achieved a CCyR.86
An MMR was achieved in 27 of 85 patients (32%), of
which 15 (18%) were complete molecular response
(CMR). The most common AEs were gastrointestinal and
usually were grade 1/2, manageable, and improved spontaneously after 3 or 4 weeks. Bosutinib also has demonstrated activity in patients with CML in AP and BC with a
similar safety profile.87 Imatinib-based combinations are
being studied and may increase the efficacy of imatinib
and decrease the risk of resistance.88-92 The efficacy and
tolerability of IFN maintenance therapy after experimental imatinib/IFN induction has been explored in an
attempt to avoid the need for lifelong imatinib therapy.93
Although imatinib has revolutionized therapy for
patients with CML-CP, responding patients must continue imatinib therapy indefinitely. Recently, there have
been attempts to investigate the feasibility of discontinuing imatinib therapy in patients who achieve a long-term
(>2 years) CMR. The Stop Imatinib (STIM) trial has
been initiated with the goal of evaluating molecular remissions after imatinib discontinuation.94 Molecular relapse
occurred in 41% of patients, and 96% of recurrences
occurred within the first 6 months after discontinuation.
Although all patients who developed disease recurrence after imatinib discontinuation remained sensitive to imatinib treatment, it is unclear what the long-term
consequences of allowing relapse might be for treatment
outcomes. Currently, routine discontinuation of imatinib
in responding patients cannot be recommended outside
of a clinical trial.
Conclusions
Many outstanding issues remain in the field of CML therapy. These include the role of molecular testing in routine
patient monitoring, the preferred second-line treatment
regimen for patients with imatinib failure, the role of

nilotinib and dasatinib as first-line CML therapy, and the
future use of novel treatment approaches and combination therapies in both newly diagnosed and treated
patients. Results from ongoing studies that have been initiated to address these issues are eagerly anticipated.
