Abstract
Because of the central role of the endothelium in tissue
homeostasis, protecting the vasculature from radiationinduced death is a major concern in tissue radioprotection.
Premitotic apoptosis and mitotic death are two prevalent
cell death pathways induced by ionizing radiation. Endothelial
cells undergo apoptosis after radiation through generation
of the sphingolipid ceramide. However, if mitotic death is
known as the established radiation-induced death pathway for
cycling eukaryotic cells, direct involvement of mitotic death in
proliferating endothelial radiosensitivity has not been clearly
shown. In this study, we proved that proliferating human
microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) undergo two waves
of death after exposure to 15 Gy radiation: an early premitotic
apoptosis dependent on ceramide generation and a delayed
DNA damage–induced mitotic death. The fact that sphingosine1-phosphate (S1P), a ceramide antagonist, protects HMEC-1
only from membrane-dependent apoptosis but not from DNA
damage–induced mitotic death proves the independence of
the two pathways. Furthermore, adding nocodazole, a mitotic
inhibitor, to S1P affected both cell death mechanisms and fully
prevented radiation-induced death. If our results fit with the
standard model in which S1P signaling inhibits ceramidemediated apoptosis induced by antitumor treatments, such
as radiotherapy, they exclude, for the first time, a significant
role of S1P-induced molecular survival pathway against
mitotic death. Discrimination between ceramide-mediated
apoptosis and DNA damage–induced mitotic death may give
the opportunity to define a new class of radioprotectors for
normal tissues in which quiescent endothelium represents
the most sensitive target, while excluding malignant tumor
containing proproliferating angiogenic endothelial cells that
are sensitive to mitotic death. [Cancer Res 2007;67(4):1803–11]

Introduction
For decades, DNA damage was considered as the principal cause
of cell death induced by ionizing radiation. DNA double-strand
breaks, which generate chromosomal aberrations, induce mitotic
death (e.g., clonogenic or reproductive death). Mitotic death is a
slow process occurring after a variable number of cell cycles (1),

characterized by anaphase bridges, exclusion of micronuclei from
the nucleus (2), cell enlargement (3), and generation of polyploid
cells (4). Besides mitotic death, DNA damage is also involved in
radiation-induced apoptosis by initiating signalization pathways
that lead to the subsequent induction of a wide range of genes,
such as ATM (5) or p53 (6). New developments showed that other
cell compartments are also involved in radiosensitivity. Indeed,
cell membrane also represents a major target in radiation-induced
apoptosis (7). Activation of the acid sphingomyelinase enzyme
pool on the outer cell membrane layer potentiates sphingomyelin
hydrolysis to ceramide, inducing membrane rearrangement, raft
formation, and apoptotic signal transduction (8).
By supplying nutriments and oxygen, the endothelium network
maintains tissue homeostasis. Vasculature represents a highly
differentiated tissue where endothelial cells are quiescent in most
of the normal physiologic conditions, except during tissue repair.
Endothelium dysfunctions, such as loss of nonproliferating status
during tumor angiogenesis, are involved in severe pathologies (9).
Because of these physiologic outputs, understanding the death
mechanism of the endothelial cell has a genuine relevance. In vitro
radiosensitivity of endothelial cell has been essentially studied by
clonogenic assays (10, 11). If clonogenic assay measures the
capacity of the irradiated cell to divide into colony, correlation
between clonogenic assay and mortality is partial. Indeed,
clonogenic assay is related as much to survival and proliferation
as to death, without discriminating the different types of death.
New developments in radiobiology, such as generation of
transgenic murine models, allowed to better define factors involved
in endothelial cell radiosensitivity. In vitro (12) and in vivo (13)
studies showed the crucial roles of acid sphingomyelinase enzyme
activation and a rapid ceramide generation in radiation-induced
endothelial cell death. Ionizing radiation acts directly on bovine
aortic endothelial cell membrane preparations devoid of nuclei,
proving that ceramide generation after irradiation is independent
of DNA damage and cell cycle regulation induced by DNA doublestrand breaks (14). Furthermore, invalidation of acid sphingomyelinase (asmase) gene in mice inhibited the radiation-induced
endothelial cell apoptosis (15), which leads to tissue response as
injury to the central nervous system (16), gastrointestinal
syndrome (13), or blood-brain barrier disruption (17). Microvascular apoptosis has also been characterized by tumor response to
high-dose radiotherapy. A 15 Gy irradiation of fibrosarcoma or
melanoma tumor cells transplanted in mice rapidly induced a
massive endothelial cell apoptosis via acid sphingomyelinase
activation, which led to tumor regression (18). These results
showed the importance of the acid sphingomyelinase and ceramide
pair in endothelial cell apoptosis in normal or tumor tissue

integrity after ionizing radiation, as well as the critical role of
endothelial cell in maintenance of normal or tumor integrity.
Pharmacologic alteration of the ceramide metabolic pathway
should modulate endothelial cell death and tissue response.
Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a ceramide metabolite, is a
bioactive sphingolipid that has been characterized as a potent
signal transduction–inducing molecule that exerts diverse biological responses, such as cellular differentiation, hypertrophy,
proliferation, migration (19), and cell survival (20). S1P protection
mechanisms seem to occur when apoptosis is dependent on
ceramide generation (21). Indeed, S1P was shown to protect
human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) from C2-ceramide–
mediated apoptosis (22). In vivo studies using C57Bl/6 mouse
model showed that S1P pretreatment in ovarian bursa protects
mice from chemotherapy- or radiotherapy-induced sterility
through inhibition of ceramide-mediated apoptosis in oocytes
(23, 24). Ceramide/S1P balance has the capacity to modulate cell
apoptosis and tissue radiosensitivity. However, no study has
validated the potential protecting effect of S1P on endothelial cells
after high-dose radiation.
If previous studies showed that quiescent endothelial cells,
found in normal tissue, died by ceramide generation–dependent
apoptosis after exposure to high dose of radiation (13, 17, 25, 26),
the death mechanisms have not been explored for proliferating
endothelial cells, which are present in pathologic tissues such as
tumor angiogenesis. In this study, we propose to investigate the
contribution of two major death pathways (i.e., DNA damage–
induced mitotic death and ceramide generation–induced apoptosis) involved in radiosensitivity status of the proliferating
endothelial cell. Because of its radioprotective effects in several
cell models toward a large spectrum of stresses, the involvement
of S1P in protecting proliferating endothelial cells will be more
specifically studied in these two major radiosensitive pathways.

Materials and Methods
Cell Culture and Treatments
Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) were kindly provided by F.J. Candal (Center for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA; ref. 27).
HMEC-1 cells were seeded at a density of 20,000/cm2 and allowed to
reach subconfluence for 5 days in MCDB 131 medium (Invitrogen, Cergy
Pontoise, France) supplemented with 15% FCS, 10 ng/mL epidermal growth
factor, 2 Ag/mL hydrocortisone, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin, referred to as endothelial cell complete
medium.
Irradiations of subconfluent HMEC-1 cells were carried out in a Faxitron
CP160 irradiator (Faxitron X-ray Corporation, Buffalo Grove, IL) at a dose
rate of 1.48 Gy/min and a total dose between 2 and 30 Gy. Two hours before
irradiation, cell medium was changed to low-serum medium (MCDB 131
medium supplemented with 0.1% FCS, 2 Ag/mL hydrocortisone, 2 mmol/L
L-glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin).
Different pharmacologic drugs were added to the low-serum medium
2 h before irradiation: 1 Amol/L fumonisin B1 (Biomol, Philadelphia, PA)
or 1 Amol/L S1P (Biomol; prepared as previously described in ref. 23).
Exceptions were made for desipramine (50 Amol/L; Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Quentin-Favier, France), which was added 15 min before irradiation
and removed 1 h after, and nocodazole (0.1 Ag/mL; Sigma-Aldrich), which
was added 24 h after radiation for another 24 h.

Detection of Apoptosis
Cell counting assay. As previously described (28), apoptotic fraction was
calculated by taking the ratio of floating cell number to total cell number
( floating + adherent). Floating cell population represented the nonadherent
cells in the culture medium, and loosely adherent cells were derived from

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (4). February 15, 2007

two PBS washes of the monolayer. Adherent cells were trypsinized. Cell
number of both fractions was determined using Malassez slides.
Detection of apoptotic marker Apo2.7. Apo2.7 (7A6 antigen) has been
described as a mitochondrial marker of apoptosis (29). Adherent and
floating cells, either pooled or not, were washed twice with PBS, and labeled
with the monoclonal antibody (mAb) anti–Apo2.7-phycoerythrin (clone
2.7A6A3) according to the supplier’s recommendations (Immunotech,
Marseilles, France). Acquisitions were done on a FACSCalibur flow
cytometer (BD Biosciences, Le Pont de Claix, France), and data were
analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences).

Cell Cycle Analysis
[3H]thymidine incorporation. Sixteen hours after irradiation, HMEC-1
cells were incubated with low-serum medium containing [3H]thymidine
(1 ACi/mL) for 8 h. Cells were then trypsinized and harvested with a Titertek
cell harvester (Flow Laboratories, Rickmansworth, United Kingdom) on
glass fiber filter (Wallac Perkin-Elmer, Courtaboeuf, France). Cells were then
dried and incubated with Betaplate scintillation liquid (Wallac Perkin-Elmer).
h Radioactivity was counted by using a scintillation spectrometer (Wallac
Perkin-Elmer). [3H]thymidine incorporation was analyzed with the Microbeta Windows Workstation software (Wallac Perkin-Elmer).
Propidium iodide staining. Floating and adherent cells were pooled,
washed with PBS, fixed in 70% ethanol for 20 min at 20jC, and stained
with 40 Ag/mL propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) and 100 Ag/mL RNase
(Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) for 30 min at 37jC in the dark. Cell cycle
phases were quantified using Flow Jo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR).

DNA Damage Assessment
Detection of phosphorylated histone H2AX. For the detection of DNA
double-strand breaks after irradiation, staining for phosphorylated H2AX
(gH2AX) was conducted as described previously (30). Cells were trypsinized,
washed with PBS, and fixed in 70% ethanol overnight at 20jC. Cells were
rehydrated for 10 min in PBS/4% FCS/0.1% Triton X-100, and resuspended
in 200 AL of mouse mAb against gH2AX (clone JBW301; Euromedex,
Mundolsheim, France; 1:500 dilution in PBS/2% FCS/0.1% Triton X-100) for
2 h at room temperature. Cells were washed in PBS/2% FCS/0.1% Triton
X-100 and resuspended in secondary antibody, a phycoerythrin-conjugated
goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab¶)2 fragment (Beckman Coulter, Roissy, France;
1:100 dilution in PBS/2% FCS/0.1% Triton X-100) for 1 h at room
temperature. Cells were washed and resuspended in 20 Ag/mL 7-aminoactinomycin D (Sigma-Aldrich) before analysis with a BD FACSArray
Bioanalyser (BD Biosciences). Analyses of flow cytometry data were
conducted using CellQuest software.
Cytogenetic analyses. Twenty-two hours 30 min after 15 Gy irradiation,
colchicine (0.1 Ag/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) was added for 1 h 30 min before
collecting the cells. Then, cultures were trypsinized and suspended in
hypotonic solution (0.075 mol/L KCl), incubated for 20 min at 37jC, and
fixed in methanol/acetic acid (3:1). Cell suspensions were dropped on slides
and dried. Slides were processed according to the fluorochrome plus
Giemsa method by Perry and Wolff (31) to score mitotic index (percentage
of metaphase), chromosomal aberrations, and number of cell divisions done
posttreatment. Cell culture duration postirradiation was determined to
score chromosomal aberrations exclusively from the first division.
Telomeres were detected by a (C3TA2)3PNA-Cy3 probe (Perceptive
Biosystem, Boston, MA), whereas centromeres were detected by a Pancentromere probe (Cambio, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Hybridized
metaphases were captured with a charge coupled device camera (Zeiss,
Jena, Germany) coupled to a Zeiss Axioplan microscope and were processed
with the ISIS software (MetaSystems, Altlussheim, Germany). At least 100
metaphases were examined for each sample. We scored chromosome
rearrangements, such as dicentrics or multicentrics, rings, and excess
acentrics (i.e., we did not score the acentric generated with one dicentric
chromosome). To determine the number of breaks per metaphase, the
number of breaks per type of aberration was assigned as follows: one
dicentric (two breaks), one tricentric ( four breaks), one quadricentric (six
breaks), one pentacentric (eight breaks), one ring (two breaks), and one
minute or one acentric (one break).

S1P Radioprotection of Proliferating Endothelial Cells
Detection of micronuclei. Floating and adherent cells were pooled
48 h after 15 Gy irradiation, washed with PBS, spread on slides with a
Cytospin (Thermo Electron Corp., Waltham, MA) at 800 rpm for 2 min, fixed
in paraformaldehyde (0.5%) for 30 min, and permeabilized with Triton
X-100 (0.1% in PBS) for 10 min. Slides were washed twice with PBS,
incubated in 5 Ag/mL propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 mg/mL
RNase (Qiagen) for 1 h at 37jC in the dark, and rinsed in 10 mmol/L Tris.
Cells were visualized with a 400 lens on a fluorescent microscope
(Axiovert 200-M; Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany).

Statistical Analysis
All values were reported as mean F SD or SE as indicated. Data were
analyzed using the Student’s t test or the Mann-Whitney test (SIGMASTAT
software, Jandel Scientific, Erkrath, Germany). Differences were considered
as significant at P < 0.05 unless indicated otherwise.

Results
Irradiation induces endothelial cell apoptosis in a dose- and
time-dependent manner. Exposure of subconfluent HMEC-1 to

X-rays results in a dose- and time-dependent decrease in the
number of adherent cells and increase in the number of floating
cells. Twenty-four hours after radiation, 38.3 F 4.9%, 48.6 F 12.2%,
and 75.2 F 4.9% less adherent cells were quantified, respectively,
in 5, 15, or 30 Gy irradiated cells compared with unirradiated cells.
Floating cells in the culture medium increased with dose.
Compared with control, 2-, 4.5-, and 6.5-fold higher floating cells
were quantified in 5, 15, or 30 Gy conditions, respectively (Fig. 1A).
The single dose of 15 Gy is chosen for the rest of the study because
of the physiologic relevance of endothelial cell apoptosis after
irradiation at high dose (13). The use of the apoptotic mitochondrial marker Apo2.7 confirms the induction of apoptotic cells after
radiation (23.8% apoptotic cells 24 h after 15 Gy versus 8.4% for
control; Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the fact that 90.2% of the floating
cells are Apo2.7 positive validated our cell counting assay as an
apoptotic assay (Fig. 1B). Similar to the dose-dependent quantification of endothelial cell death, we follow the generation of
apoptotic HMEC-1 cells as a function of time. After a single 15 Gy

irradiation, two waves of floating cells were observed: the first
one reached a plateau at 25% of apoptotic cells 6 h postradiation
until 24 h; the second one started 24 h postradiation increasing to
66 F 20.2% of floating cells at 72 h (Fig. 1C) and reaching a peak of
>86% at 92 h (data not shown).
Inhibition of ceramide pathway by S1P or desipramine
blocks early apoptosis but not late death. To confirm that
radiation-induced apoptosis in HMEC-1 cells is mediated by acid
sphingomyelinase activation–induced ceramide generation, as
shown in endothelial cells in vivo in the central nervous system
(16) or in gastrointestinal syndrome (13), experiments were carried
out using the acid sphingomyelinase inhibitor desipramine.
Apoptotic counting assay done 24 h postirradiation shows that

50 Amol/L desipramine pretreatment significantly decreased
apoptosis by 52.4%, compared with the 15 Gy control (P = 0.003),
to background level of nonirradiated cells (Fig. 2A). Nevertheless,
desipramine treatment does not inhibit the late apoptosis observed
at 72 h during the second wave of death (39.4 F 1.4% of apoptosis
for control and 42.5 F 1.4% for desipramine-treated cells; P > 0.1).
Besides the acid sphingomyelinase pathway, de novo biosynthesis
by ceramide synthase represents another major ceramide generation pathway activated in endothelial cells after radiation (26, 32).
To evaluate the specificity of the acid sphingomyelinase pathway,
the ceramide synthase inhibitor fumonisin B1 was used. We
observed no difference between radiation-induced apoptosis of
1 Amol/L fumonisin B1–treated HMEC-1 and untreated cells, 24 and

S1P Radioprotection of Proliferating Endothelial Cells

72 h after 15 Gy irradiation (Fig. 2A), proving the major role of
the acid sphingomyelinase and ceramide pair in HMEC-1 early
radiosensitivity.
Because of the ceramide/S1P rheostat model, we investigated
if S1P could protect HMEC-1 from radiation-induced apoptosis
mediated by ceramide generation. Two hours of pretreatment with
1 Amol/L S1P lowered the number of apoptotic cells by 2-fold,
24 h after 15 Gy, nearly to the background level (30.5 F 5.2%
of apoptosis for control and 15.3 F 3.4% for S1P-treated cells,
P = 0.013; Fig. 2B). Apo2.7 staining (Fig. 2C) and terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL)
assay (data not shown) confirmed S1P radioprotection, which
pointed out a significant 33.3% and 21.2% decrease in apoptotic
HMEC-1 cell percentage in 15 Gy irradiated condition pretreated
with 1 Amol/L S1P compared with the 15 Gy control, respectively.
The specificity of the S1P radioprotection was determined by
dihydro-S1P, a sphingolipid related to S1P. Indeed, 2 h of 1 Amol/L
dihydro-S1P pretreatment does not inhibit the HMEC-1 apoptosis
rate 24 h after 15 Gy (data not shown).
Although S1P inhibits radiation-induced apoptosis in HMEC-1
cells 24 h after radiation, protection by S1P is not effective in the
late death wave. Indeed, no statistical difference in floating cell
counting assay was found 72 h after 15 Gy irradiation between the
S1P-treated and untreated conditions (36.9 F 12.8% for S1P-treated
group versus 42.7 F 8.5% for vehicle-treated group; P > 0.5; Fig. 2B).
Results are confirmed by Apo2.7 staining (Fig. 2D). After exposure
to 15 Gy radiation, we observed percentages of death of 43.9% for
control and 42.5% for S1P-pretreated cells.
S1P does not protect HMEC-1 from DNA damage and
mitotic catastrophe. The fact that desipramine or S1P has no
action on late death shows that the second wave of death is
independent of acid sphingomyelinase activation–induced ceramide generation and membrane signaling. DNA damage–induced cell
death is also a major cell death pathway after X-ray radiation (33).
Cells containing gH2AX foci (each focus represents a single DNA
double-strand break) were quantified by fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS) analysis as a function of time, irradiation, and S1P
treatment. Maximum gH2AX-positive cell ratio was observed
within the window between 30 min and 1 h after exposure to
15 Gy radiation (83.2 F 6.7% in sham condition versus 74.3 F 11.2%
in S1P condition 30 min postradiation, P > 0.5; Fig. 3A). Furthermore, no difference in the mean of fluorescence intensity, representing the number of foci per cell, was observed at the different
time points of the experiment (data not shown). Similar kinetic
profiles of DNA double-strand break induction and their repair,
represented by the increase and the decrease of gH2AX-positive
cells, respectively, were observed in HMEC-1 cells treated or not by
S1P (Fig. 3A).
Irradiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks leads to chromosomal rearrangements, mitotic catastrophe, and death. Radiation-induced chromosomal damage, quantified by the number of
chromosomal breaks per metaphase, was studied 24 h after
exposure to radiation. Because of the high level of cell death and
low level of metaphases observed after exposure to 15 Gy radiation,
chromosomal breaks per metaphase were analyzed in HMEC-1
cells irradiated at 0, 2, and 5 Gy. First, we observed that the
percentage of breaks per metaphase increased in a dose-dependent
manner, independent of treatment with S1P or its vehicle (0 Gy,
P = 0.5; 2 Gy, P > 0.3; 5 Gy, P > 0.5; Fig. 3B). Furthermore, no
difference in quality of breaks, such as multicentric, acentric, and
minute chromosomal damages, was observed in irradiated

Experiments carried out at 10 and 15 Gy irradiation showed the
same rate and types of breaks per metaphase tendencies when
HMEC-1 cells were treated with S1P or its vehicle (data not shown;
metaphase number is too small for statistical distribution).
Severe chromosomal damage fails to produce correct chromosomal segregation after mitosis, which results in micronuclei
exclusion and leads to mitotic death (1). To assess the mechanism

of death during the second-wave postirradiation, micronuclei
formation was quantified 48 h after exposure to 15 Gy radiation.
A 3.3-fold increase of cells with one or more micronuclei was
observed after radiation compared with nonirradiated cells,
proving that the late death represents cells that are dying by
mitotic death (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, pretreatment with S1P does
not inhibit the amount of cells with one or more micronuclei after
irradiation [S1P + 15 Gy treatment (28.8 F 2.1%) versus 15 Gy
treatment (28.7 F 2.7%); P > 0.9; Fig. 3C].
S1P does not modulate cell cycle inhibition involved in
mitotic death. Mitotic death is considered to be a slow process
occurring after a variable number of cell cycles (34). To confirm the
nonprotective effect of S1P during the mitotic death wave,
proliferation and regulation of cell cycle were studied after
radiation. First, we ensured that S1P radioprotection into the first
wave of apoptotic death is not due to an upsurge of endothelial cell
proliferation using [3H]thymidine incorporation assay. In nonirradiated HMEC-1 cells, 24 h after S1P treatment, proliferation
increased by 1.2-fold compared with untreated cells, confirming
the proangiogenic action of S1P (Fig. 4A; ref. 35). However, after
15 Gy irradiation, cell proliferation decreased by 7.3- and 8.9-fold
for sham- and S1P-treated cells, respectively, but no difference
between vehicle or S1P-treated cell proliferation was observed
(P > 0.8; Fig. 4A). Results were confirmed by analysis of mitotic
index. Twenty-four hours after a dose range of 2 to 15 Gy, HMEC-1
mitotic index decreased in a dose-dependent manner. No statistical
difference between S1P-treated cell mitotic index and control was
observed ( for 15 Gy, P > 0.7; Fig. 4B).
Cell cycle distribution 24 h after 15 Gy irradiation was examined
by propidium iodide incorporation (Fig. 4C). Unirradiated cultures
maintained a typical cell cycle distribution of asynchronous
populations (G1, 41 F 6.8% for control and 43.4 F 4.6% for S1P;
S, 15.8 F 8% for control and 18.4 F 6.1% for S1P; G2-M, 23.1 F
11.2% for control and 19.6 F 4.8% for S1P). As already been shown,
irradiation-induced G2-M arrest was observed in HMEC-1 since
6 h postirradiation. Moreover, S1P does not modulate the efficiency
or the kinetic of the G2-M cell cycle control after irradiation.
Twenty-four hours after exposure to 15 Gy radiation, 48.2 F 8.2%
of the control cells were arrested in G2-M versus 50 F 5.5% for
S1P-treated cells (Fig. 4C; P > 0.6).
Combination of S1P and nocodazole treatments highly
protects proliferating endothelial cell by inhibiting ceramide
apoptotic pathway and mitotic death, respectively. Because cell
cycle has to be processed to develop mitotic death, we used
nocodazole, which inhibits microtubule formation, to block or
delay mitotic death. Forty-eight hours after 15 Gy irradiation, 30.6%
decreased cell death was observed in nocodazole-treated HMEC-1
compared with control cells (Fig. 5A). S1P treatment showed no
significant difference between S1P or sham-treated irradiated cells,
thus confirming data shown in Fig. 2B and D (P > 0.2; Fig. 5A).
To further validate that HMEC-1 radiation-induced death involves
two different mechanisms (e.g., ceramide-mediated apoptosis and
DNA damage–mediated mitotic death), HMEC-1 were treated with
S1P before irradiation and with nocodazole after irradiation.
Enhancements of radioprotection by 2- and 1.5-fold were observed
when 15 Gy irradiated HMEC-1 cells were treated by S1P +
nocodazole (P V 0.001) and by nocodazole alone (P V 0.001;
Fig. 5A), respectively.
Because of their involvement in mitotic death, micronuclei
incidence was determined in irradiated HMEC-1 to validate the
protection by dual S1P + nocodazole treatments (Fig. 5B). First, as

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (4). February 15, 2007

expected, treatment by S1P did not modify the incidence of
micronuclei in irradiated HMEC-1 (P > 0.9; Fig. 5B). Moreover, cell
population irradiated and treated with nocodazole contains 40.5%
fewer cells with micronuclei compared with control (P = 0.004;
Fig. 5B). Better radioprotection was observed when cells were
treated with S1P and nocodazole together. In this condition,
incidence of cells with micronuclei decreased to 37.5% compared
with untreated cells (P V 0.001; Fig. 5B).

tion studies and micronuclei assays correlated the second wave
of death with DNA damage generation and mitotic death, the
definitive involvement of which was proven by inhibition of late
cell death by nocodazole, a mitosis inhibitor.
DNA damage triggers molecular pathways controlled by key
molecular node, especially ceramide synthase and p53. In bovine
aortic endothelial cells, fumonisin B1 blocked X-ray–induced death
through inhibition of ceramide synthase, making it an attractive
target to explain our late cell death phenomenon (32). In our
endothelial cell model, maximum tolerated dose of fumonisin B1
was not able to inhibit the second wave of death, meaning that
ceramide synthase activation does not seem to be involved in
radiation-induced HMEC-1 mitotic death. The major discrepancy
between Liao’s study and ours is the proliferation status of the
endothelial cells. X-ray experiments in bovine aortic endothelial
cells have been realized using quiescent endothelial cells, excluding
the mitotic death analysis, whereas our experiments allowed use
of proliferating HMEC-1 cells to study the involvement of mitotic
death and its molecular factors in endothelial cell radiosensitivity.
HMEC-1 cells are immortalized with SV40 large T-antigen, which
inactivates p53 and might modify DNA damage–induced apoptosis
and cell cycle arrest. However, previous results have shown that
acid sphingomyelinase– and ceramide-mediated apoptosis induced
in microvascular endothelium was independent of p53 status. At
the difference of invalidation of asmase gene, disruption of p53 in
mice neither modified high-dose radiation–induced endothelial cell
apoptosis inside the lamina propria and around the crypt nor
inhibited small intestine necrosis or animal death timing (13). Our
first wave of death in HMEC-1 is dependent on acid sphingomyelinase activation and ceramide generation, in which SV40 is not
known to be interfering with. Mitotic death occurs after cell cycle
G2 arrest. If p53 is known to regulate cell cycle after ionizing

Discussion
The effect of endothelial cell radiosensitivity in tissue damage
and tumor regression to high-dose radiation has been previously
described (13, 18, 36). Confluent endothelial cells have been shown
to die after radiation through generation of proapoptotic factor
ceramide (14). However, if mitotic death represents the established
radiation-induced death pathway for most dividing eukaryotic
cells, involvement of mitotic death in proliferating endothelial cell
radiosensitivity has not been distinctly shown. In this study, we
prove that proliferating endothelial cells undergo mitotic death if
ceramide-mediated death is inhibited by S1P (Fig. 6).
Apoptotic cell count, Apo2.7 staining, and TUNEL assay of
irradiated HMEC-1 cells showed that HMEC-1 radiosensitivity
comprises two waves of death. The first wave of death, between 0
and 24 h postradiation, depended on acid sphingomyelinase
activation and ceramide generation because desipramine treatment was able to inhibit this early endothelial death. The second
wave of death occurring 24 h after radiation was insensitive to
desipramine treatment and thus independent of acid sphingomyelinase/ceramide apoptotic pathway (Fig. 6). Chromosomal aberra-

radiation, especially by inducing G1 arrest through increase of p21
expression, different studies also showed that X-ray–induced
apoptosis occurring after G2 arrest might be independent of p53
(37–39). We ultimately prove the relevance of the two waves of
death by confirming data obtained in the SV40-immortalized
endothelial cell, in human primary macrovascular endothelial cells.
Indeed, S1P is able to protect human primary macrovascular
endothelial cells from the first wave of radiation toxicity at 24 h but
not from the second wave of death observed at 72 h (data not
shown), as shown in HMEC-1. Further studies will help to better
understand the molecular pathways involved in the second wave
of death.
Pretreatment of HMEC-1 with a therapeutic relevant dose of S1P
protects against early apoptosis, which is dependent on ceramide
generation induced by radiation exposure, but not the late death,
which is dependent on DNA damage. Moreover, S1P action in
irradiated HMEC-1 cells seems specific, because other sphingolipids, such as dihydro-S1P, do not enhance radioprotection (data
not shown). A key function of S1P is to mediate vascular growth by
enhancing endothelial cell proliferation. This proproliferative
action of S1P could explain its radioprotective activity. This
survival mechanism has already been embodied by lovastatin,
a lipid-lowering molecule, which inhibits HUVEC radiosensitivity
at late time point after radiation, partially by an increase of
endothelial cell proliferation (40). Our results using [3H]thymidine
incorporation or mitotic index analysis showed that S1P does not
protect microvascular endothelial cell by an upsurge of proliferation (Fig. 4A and B). Apo2.7 apoptotic staining definitely proves
direct inhibition of ceramide-mediated apoptosis by S1P treatment
(Fig. 2C). Our results fit with the main dogma of the ‘‘ceramide/S1P
rheostat,’’ which determines the death and survival status of cells
exposed to lethal stress (41). Moreover, our study is the first one to
show the pharmacologic input of S1P in modulation of microvascular endothelial cell apoptosis after exposure to a high dose of
ionizing radiation.
To understand the absence of S1P protection toward mitotic
death, we wondered if S1P interfered with DNA damage–controlled
pathway. We first studied the rate of loss of gH2AX, a
phosphorylated histone localized in a DNA repair foci (42). The
fact that S1P- or vehicle-treated cells throughout expressed a
similar percentage of cells with foci and a similar average number
of foci per cell (mean value) proves that S1P pretreatment does not
affect the rate of DNA double-strand breaks induced by ionizing
radiation and does not confer an enhancement of repair
machinery. Because insufficiently repaired or misrepaired doublestrand breaks might lead to chromosome breaks, deletions, and
translocations (43), we also analyzed the percentage of breaks per
metaphase with respect to the ionizing radiation dose. S1P
pretreatment did not modulate the rate of breaks by metaphase
(quantitative analysis) or the types of breaks, such as ring, acentric,
and multicentric (qualitative analysis), induced by increasing dose
of ionizing radiation (Fig. 3B; and data not shown).
Chromosomal abnormalities, appearance of micronuclei, and
cell cycle modulation, which we all validated in our endothelial cell
model, are the main characteristic events of mitotic death (1).
Furthermore, mitotic death requires a transient G2-M arrest and
also takes a longer incubation period (>24 h) until execution of cell
death compared with premitotic apoptosis (39). As previously
shown by Khodarev et al. (11), we also observed by propidium
iodide staining the strong G2-M arrest and the dead cells in sub-G1
phase 48 h postradiation, characteristic of the mitotic death.

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (4). February 15, 2007

Mitotic death was thought to be exhibited mainly by nonhematopoietic cell lineages, although the involvement of mitotic
death in proliferating endothelial cell radiosensitivity has not been
clearly shown, except when endothelial cells are irradiated after
angiostatin pretreatment (10).
Modulating the early ceramide-dependent death by S1P and the
late DNA damage–dependent death by nocodazole affected
proliferating endothelial cell death after radiation and showed
the independence of the two waves of death. Compared with shamirradiated cells, S1P pretreatment does not reduce the amount
of cells with micronuclei, a mitotic death marker, explaining
the high level of mitotic death observed 48 h postradiation in
both conditions. Differences in late death and micronuclei rates
(Fig. 5A and B, respectively) between nocodazole-treated and S1P +
nocodazole–treated irradiated cells are explained by the fact that
S1P and nocodazole treatment gives an additive protection,
whereas nocodazole treatment prevents or delays endothelial cell
only from late death. Other studies already showed that S1P
protects cells from genotoxic agents (21, 23, 24, 44). However, none
of these studies were able to discriminate protection due to
inhibition of ceramide-mediated apoptosis from the one dependent
on DNA damage radiosensitivity. Our extensive study on proliferating endothelial cell death after radiation represents the first study
to exclude S1P radioprotection from the process involving
interaction with DNA repair machinery or cell cycle modulation.
As recently pointed out (45), S1P metabolism has taken center
stage in cancer development and treatment. High expression of
sphingosine kinase 1, an enzyme transforming sphingosine to S1P,
in tumor cell was correlated with low patient survival (46).
Treatment of nude mice by sphingosine kinase 1 inhibitors reduced
gastric and mammary adenocarcinoma tumor growth (47).
Neutralizing by mAb, the pathophysiologic S1P secreted by cancer
cells and platelets in the serum delayed the growth of the tumor
by preventing angiogenesis (48). Thus, chronic secretion of S1P
appears to play a major role in tumorigenesis by protecting tumor
cells and by enhancing microvascularization induced by other key
proangiogenic growth factors [vascular endothelial growth factor
and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF); ref. 45]. These
protumoral sides of S1P are counterbalanced by the fact that S1P
radioprotection, at a therapeutic, single, relevant low dose, is
specific on ceramide-dependent endothelial cell apoptosis. This
offers a promising approach for pharmacologically improving the
radioprotection of normal tissues. Indeed, adult normal tissue
vasculature is quiescent (49) because of the equilibrium between
angiogenic promoters and inhibitors (9). Because of this nonproliferative status of endothelial cells, DNA damage–induced
mitotic death cannot be the main observable type of death,
explaining why endothelial cells died exclusively by the acid
sphingomyelinase/ceramide–mediated apoptosis: acid sphingomyelinase knockout mice have an endothelium resistant to ionizing
radiation in brain, lung, and intestine tissues compared with wildtype mice or knockout mice for DNA damage–sensing factors, such
as DNA-PK, ATM, or p53 (13, 16, 26). Like bFGF injection, S1P
treatment should modulate ceramide in endothelial cells in vivo
and protect normal tissues from radiation-induced toxicity.
However, pathologic endothelial cells have the capacity to divide
(9). This proliferating status opens the door to mitotic death, which
S1P is not able to block. All of these important biological issues
warrant more intensive future in vivo investigation. Mitotic death
induced by radiotherapies and most of the chemotherapies are
developed to target essentially cells with high proliferating

capacity. Our data prove that S1P radioprotection is only due to
inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase/ceramide–mediated apoptosis.
In this circumstance, S1P protection will not be ubiquitous:
Therefore, selective protection by S1P of early apoptosis but not
mitotic death may give the opportunity to define a selective
radioprotector for normal tissues, in which quiescent endothelial
cells represent the most sensitive target, but not tumor containing
endothelial cells with high proliferating characteristics, which will
be sensitive to mitotic death.
