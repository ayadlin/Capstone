Abstract
Resistance to apoptosis is a recurrent theme in colon cancer. We have shown previously that the 7transmembrane spanning receptor OX1R for orexins promotes robust apoptosis in the human colon cancer
cell line HT29 through an entirely novel mechanism involving phosphorylation of tyrosine-based motifs in OX1R.
Here, we investigated the status of OX1R in a large series of human colorectal tumors and hepatic metastases. All
primary colorectal tumors regardless of their localization and Duke's stages and all hepatic metastases tested
expressed OX1R mRNA and/or protein. In sharp contrast, adjacent normal colonocytes or hepatocytes as well as
control normal tissues were negative. Next, we showed that nine human colon cancer cell lines established from
primary tumors or metastases expressed OX1R mRNA and underwent important apoptosis on orexin-A
challenge. Most interestingly, orexin-A also promoted robust apoptosis in cells that are resistant to the most
commonly used drug in colon cancer chemotherapy, 5-fluorouracil. When human colon cancer cells were
xenografted in nude mice, orexin-A administered at day 0 strongly slowed the tumor growth and even reversed
the development of established tumors when administered 7 days after cell inoculation. Orexin-A also acts by
promoting tumor apoptosis in vivo because caspase-3 is activated in tumors on orexin treatment of nude mice.
These findings support that OX1R is an Achilles heel of colon cancers, even after metastasis or chemoresistance.
They suggest that OX1R agonists might be novel candidates for colon cancer therapy. Cancer Res; 71(9); 3341–51.

Introduction
Colon cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality in many
countries (1). Molecular genetic studies have identified key
genes whose mutations or altered expression can cause colon
cancer (2). Many observations also indicated that colon cancer
growth is under the control of a variety of peptide growth factors
(3) acting at tyrosine kinase receptors or G-protein–coupled
receptors (GPCR). Among those receptors, epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) is prominent in colon cancers (4) due to
its autoactivity and also because it can be transactivated by
GPCRs (5). It is a therapeutic target because antibodies directed
against EGFR have shown efficacy in colorectal cancer (4).

Much less is known about receptors and/or peptides that
inhibit growth and/or promote apoptosis of colon cancer cells.
Some years ago, we reasoned that besides growth factors or
peptide hormones that promote colon cancer growth (3), we
should be able to find natural peptides behaving as suppressors of colon cancer growth. We tested this hypothesis by
screening the ability of a large series of peptide hormones and
neuropeptides to inhibit the growth of the human colon
cancer cell line HT29 cultured in the presence of fetal calf
serum (FCS; ref. 6). We made 2 hits with orexin-A and orexin-B
which appear to be robust growth inhibitors (6). Orexins do
not alter cell cycle but promote strong apoptosis by inducing
cytochrome c release from mitochondria to cytosol and
activation of caspase-3 and caspase-7 (6).
Orexin-A and orexin-B (7), also named hypocretin-1 and
hypocretin-2 (8), were discovered as hypothalamic peptides
that are encoded in a prepro-orexin precursor. The 2 peptides
are present in hypothalamic neurons that regulate sleep,
wakefulness, feeding, breathing, reward system, or drug addiction (9). Functions of orexins have been also described in a few
peripheral tissues (10, 11), but expression of orexins at the
periphery remains debatable (11–13). Classically, the actions
of orexins are mediated by two 7-pass transmembrane receptors OX1R and OX2R (7), the activation of which induces
cellular calcium transients through Gq-dependent and -independent pathways (14).

Voisin et al.

We showed that OX1R triggers apoptosis by an entirely
novel mechanism (15, 16) which is not related to Gq-mediated
phopholipase C activation and cellular calcium transients (13).
Orexins induce tyrosine phosphorylation of 2 tyrosine-based
motifs in OX1R, ITIM and ITSM, resulting in the recruitment
of the phosphotyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, the activation of
which is responsible for mitochondrial apoptosis (15, 16).
Given that (i) failure of tumor cells to undergo apoptosis
translates into tumor progression and chemotherapeutic
resistance and (ii) apoptosis emerges as a potential target
for cancer treatment (17, 18), it was important to determine
the status of orexin receptors and orexin-induced apoptosis in
colon cancer. In the present work, we addressed this question
by studying the expression of orexin receptors in a large series
of primary colonic tumors and also in hepatic metastases. We
also investigated the ability of orexins to promote apoptosis in
a large panel of colon cancer cell lines. We show that the
receptor OX1R is not present in normal colon or liver but is
aberrantly expressed in all primary tumors and hepatic metastases tested. Futhermore, we show that orexins promote
apoptosis in most of the colon cancer cell lines tested including in cells which are resistant to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), the
most commonly used drug in colon cancer chemotherapy (4).
Finally, we showed that orexins strongly reduced the development of tumors in nude mice xenografted with human
colon cancer cells. Because peripheral expression of orexins is
debatable (13), we also studied the expression of the orexin
precursor mRNA by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in
primary colon tumors, hepatic metastases, and normal colon
and liver samples. No orexin precursor mRNA could be
detected in any samples. These data indicate that OX1R
may be considered as a new valuable gate to apoptosis which
could be openable by exogenous orexins or OX1R agonists
in colon cancer even after metastasis and chemoresistance to
5-FU.

Materials and Methods
Tissue collection
Thirty-eight archival specimens of formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded human colonic carcinomas were selected to offer a
sampling according to the severity of the disease and the
different sites of the large intestine (see Table 1). Biopsy
samples obtained during endoscopy of normal adults suffering
from irritable bowel syndrome were also studied. Several
frozen unfixed tissues were used for qRT-PCR: 10 colonic
carcinoma, 5 nontumoral colon tissues, 10 hepatic metastasectomies, and 7 nontumoral hepatic tissues. Tissues were
used in accordance with the requirements of the Human
Research Committee of Hospital Bichat, Paris. Hypothalamus
cDNAs prepared from human normal brains were obtained
from Clontech.
Cell lines culture
The human colon cancer cell lines were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection. The cell lines were established from resected tumors (19, 20) as follows: HT29, SW480,
SW48, Caco-2, LS174T, and HCT116 from primary colorectal

adenocarcinomas; T84 from lung metastases; SW620 from
lymph node metastases; Colo205 from ascite metastases;
and LoVo from left supraclavicular metastases. The HT29FU cell line which resists to 1 mmol/L 5-FU was obtained as
described (21, 22). Cell lines were biannually verified by
morphology and growth characteristics and were mycoplasma
free (PCR). Cells were routinely cultured in 25-cm2 plastic
flasks (Costar) and maintained at 37 C in humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/air in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium
(DMEM) containing 4.5 g glucose/L, supplemented with 10%
FCS (Invitrogen). Caco-2 cells were grown in DMEM with 20%
FCS and 1% nonessential amino acids. Colo205 cells were
grown in RPMI 1640, LoVo cells in Ham's F12, and T84 cells in
50% DMEM/50% Ham's F12 supplemented with 10% FCS.
Immunohistochemical procedures
Five-micrometer thick sections were incubated at 37 C with
a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against human OX1R
(OX1R11-A; Alpha Diagnostic International) diluted 1:50 (20
mg/mL). Thereafter, sections were incubated with biotinylated
secondary antibody diluted 1:200, and finally with the avidin–
biotin complex diluted 1:100 (Kit ABC Vectastain; Vector
Laboratories). The peroxidase activity was revealed by the
diaminobenzidine and nuclei were counterstained with
Mayer's hemalum. Negative controls were obtained by omitting the primary antibody, by replacing the latter by normal
rabbit IgG, or by preincubation of the primary antibody with
the homologous immunogen peptide (OX1R11-P; Alpha Diagnostic International). It was also verified that 50 mg of the
hOX1R immunogen peptide per mL of diluted antiserum
totally abolished the signal. In separate experiments, we have
shown that the anti-OX1R antibody stains CHO cells expressing the recombinant OX1R, whereas no staining could be
observed in parental non-transfected CHO cells (not shown).
The intensity of immunostaining was evaluated on the basis of
3 criteria: the estimation of the percentage of immunoreactive
cells on the totality of the section; the intensity of the
immunoreactivity expressed as negative (), discrete to weak
and moderate (þ), strong (þþ), or intense (þþþ); and the
identification of the cellular components which expressed the
immunoreactivity.
Quantification of apoptotic cells by Annexin V labeling
Apoptotic cells were determined using the Guava Nexin Kit
(Guava Technologies) which discriminates between apoptotic
and nonapoptotic cells as described (6). Cells were incubated
in the absence or presence of fresh medium containing 1
mmol/L orexin-A. After 48 hours, apoptotic cell staining was
analyzed with a Guava PCA system (15). Results are expressed
as the percentage of apoptotic Annexin V/PE (phycoerythrin)positive cells and are the means of 3 independent analyses.
qRT-PCR procedure
Total RNAs in cultured cells and in frozen unfixed tissue
sections were extracted using NucleoSpin RNA II kit
(Macherey-Nagel). Quality and integrity of RNA were evaluated using an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies,
Inc.). Real-time PCR amplification was carried out using a

sizes were 85, 103, 148 and 119 bp, respectively. Ct (threshold
cycle value) values were converted into quantities relative
(Qrel) and corrected for PCR amplification efficiency, using the
following formula: Qrel ¼ 2[DCt (sample) DCt (sample)].
Tumorigenicity assay in nude mice
Exponentially growing LoVo, HT29, or HCT116 cells were
harvested, washed with PBS, and resuspended at a concentration of 1  107/mL. Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal
injection of Rompun 2%, Clorketam 1000 in 140 mL of 0.9% (w/
v) NaCl. Cells (106/100 mL) were then inoculated subcutaneously into the flank of mice. All nude mice developed
tumors following injection of 106 LoVo, HT29, or HCT116
cells. Tumor development was followed by caliper measurements in 2 dimensions (L and W), and the volume (V) of the
tumor was calculated by the formula for a prolate ellipsoid
(V ¼ L  W2 3.14/6) as reported (23). For treatment with
orexin-A, the peptide was dissolved at a concentration of 1
mg/mL in PBS and 0.112, 1.12, or 11.2 mmoles/kg of body
weight were administered daily by intraperitoneal injection.
Control mice received PBS. The body weight of mice was
similar after 30 days of treatment with and without orexin-A,
that is, 24.7  1.4 g (n ¼ 6) and 23.2  0.6 g (n ¼ 6),
respectively. No adverse effect of orexin could be observed
during treatment. Cleaved caspase-3 (C92 605; BD Pharmingen; 1:200 dilution) expression was studied by immunohistochemistry on selected paraffin sections of tumors developed in
nude mice (24).

Results
OX1R is aberrantly expressed in human colon tumors
ex vivo
We investigated OX1R expression in colonic adenocarcinomas versus normal colonic epithelium by immunohistochemistry. All the 38 tumors tested (Table 1) were immunoreactive
for OX1R (Fig. 1). The immunostaining was specific, as it
disappeared after incubation of the OX1R antibody with its
homologous immunogen peptide (Fig. 1) or when the primary
antibody was omitted (not shown). On sections, 50% to 100%
of cells were immunoreactive (Table 1). In contrast, normal
proximal and distal mucosae of patients with irritable bowel
syndrome, taken as controls, did not express OX1R (Fig. 1A).
This is in good agreement with qRT-PCR experiments which
also failed to detect any OX1R mRNA in the same tissue
samples (Table 2). The mean percentages of immunoreactive
cells were similar in the proximal and distal colon, that is, 82%
and 83%, respectively. In these 2 sites, there was no correlation
between the numbers of cells showing OX1R expression and
the severity of the tumor. The same holds true for the intensity
of immunostaining which was also independent of the severity
of the tumor, variable from one tumor to another and between
cells within a tumor. Immunostaining was observed in neoplastic glands, whereas normal glands and still normal colonocytes remained negative for immunostaining (Fig. 1C and
D). OX2R mRNA was not detectable by qRT-PCR in any colon
cancer tested (Table 2). We conclude that OX1R is aberrantly
expressed in epithelial cells during colon carcinogenesis.

Cancer Res; 71(9) May 1, 2011

The immunoexpression of OX1R in colon cancer cells was
detected predominantly intracellularly in cytoplasm and/or
nucleus as well as at the plasma membrane with a variability
depending on the tumor (Fig. 1). For the whole of colonic
cancers, the immunoreactivity predominated for 58% of them
in the cytoplasm, 47% in nuclei, whereas membranes were
seen in 34%. Dysplatic mucosae neighboring cancers showed a
variable immunolabeling. Because the main paradigm of 7transmembrane spanning receptors (25), including orexin
receptors (13), is activation at the plasma membrane by
external ligands, we further explored the cellular distribution
of OX1R in HT29 cells in which external orexins promote
apoptosis (6). When immunostaining was performed on HT29
cell pellets under the same procedure as that used for colon
tumors, very similar data were obtained, that is, labeling of
intracellular compartments and the plasma membrane (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Because orexins were previously claimed to be present in
the gut (26), though this view is now debatable (13), we tested
the possible presence of the orexin precursor mRNA in 10
colonic tumors. No orexin precursor transcript could be
detected in any colon tumor (Table 2) under conditions in
which specific amplification products were detected in human
hypothalamus taken as a control tissue where orexins are
mainly produced (7, 8). These data indicate that colon tumors
express the orexin receptor OX1R but not the orexin peptides.
OX1R is aberrantly expressed in human hepatic
metastases from colorectal cancers ex vivo
Next, we raised the question of whether OX1R present in
primary colon tumors were still expressed after migration in
their main site of metastasis (e.g., the liver). A collection of
10 human hepatic metastases was investigated for the
expression of OX1R transcripts using qRT-PCR. Seven samples of normal liver tissue which are adjacent to metastases
were used as controls. As shown in the Figure 2A, expression
of OX1R mRNA was obtained in all hepatic metastases. In
contrast, qRT-PCR experiments failed to detect any OX1R
mRNA in normal liver samples (Fig. 2A). The expression of
OX1R mRNA was similar in liver metastases and primary
colon tumors (Fig. 2 and Table 2). We confirmed these data
by investigating OX1R expression by immunohistochemistry
in hepatic metastases (Fig. 2B). All metastatic tumors studied expressed OX1R, whereas adjacent normal hepatocytes
remained negative. It is also worth noting that no orexin
precursor mRNA could be detected by qRT-PCR in human
liver (Table 2). Altogether, these data indicated that after
colon cancer cell migration to the liver, metastatic nests still
express OX1R.
OX1R mRNA expression and orexin induced apoptosis
in human colon cancer cell lines including
5-FU–resistant cells
A large collection of colon cancer cell lines was investigated for the expression of OX1R transcripts using qRT-PCR.
Expression of OX1R mRNA could be detected in all colon
cancer cell lines but one (i.e., HCT116; Fig. 3A). No mRNA for
the other orexin receptor subtype OX2R could be detected in

induced apoptosis (Fig. 3B) and subsequent reduction in
cell number (Supplementary Fig. S2) in all colon cancer cell
lines tested but one (i.e., HCT116). Similar results were
obtained with orexin-B (data not shown). It is worth noting
that these effects were observed in culture medium containing FCS which promotes robust cell growth. The extents of
apoptosis were variable from one cell line to another (Fig. 3).
Quite interestingly, they are strongly correlated with the
amounts of OX1R mRNA detected in the various cell
lines (Fig. 3C). Altogether, these data indicated that functional OX1 receptors that are able to promote apoptosis
are readily expressed in most of the colon cancer cell lines.

The most commonly used drug in colon cancer chemotherapy 5-FU is able to induce apoptosis in colon cancer
cells, but development of drug resistance is a primary cause
of failure of chemotherapy (4). To investigate the functionality of OX1R in 5-FU–resistant colon cancer cells, we used
the HT29-FU cell line in which a long-term 5-FU exposure
selected cells resistant to the drug (21). The expression of
OX1R mRNA was similar in HT29-FU cells and parental
HT29 cells (Fig. 3A). We verified that 5-FU up to 1 mmol/
L did not promote apoptosis or reduction in cell number
(Supplementary Fig. S3) in HT29-FU cells, whereas it was
quite active in the parental HT29 cells (Fig. 4). Orexin-A was
able to induce strong apoptosis in the HT29-FU cells which

ments, treatment of LoVo tumors in nude mice was initiated
7 days after inoculation of LoVo cells. It appeared that
orexin-A (1.12 mmoles/kg) very rapidly and strongly reversed
the development of established tumors (Fig. 5B). Immunohistologic examination of LoVo tumors developed in control
and orexin-A–treated mice revealed that they were poorly
differentiated adenocarcinomas in both cases (not shown).
Characterization of apoptosis in LoVo tumors developed in
nude mice was followed by immunochemical staining of
activated caspase-3 in paraffin sections of tumors (Supplementary Fig. S4). Weak and intense stainings of activated
caspase-3 were observed in control and orexin-A–treated
mice, respectively. Quite interestingly, the amount of OX1R
mRNA measured by qRT-PCR in resected LoVo tumors was
very similar in control and orexin-A–treated mice (not
shown), suggesting that long-term treatment with orexin
did not downregulate OX1R mRNA levels.
Two other human colon cancer cell lines which expressed
or not OX1R (Fig. 3) were also xenografted in nude mice (e.g.,
HT29 and HCT116, respectively). Treatment of mice developing HT29 tumors with orexin-A resulted in drastic reduction of

Discussion
In this work, we showed that ectopic expression of the
orexin receptor OX1R is a very frequent event in colon
tumorigenesis regardless of the location of primary cancer
in proximal or distal large intestine and also of their severity
from Duke's A to Duke's C grade. Indeed, OX1R is expressed in
all 38 colorectal tumors tested but not in normal glands,
still showed negative expression in normal colonocytes and
control nontumoral colonic mucosa of patients with irritable
bowel syndrome. This aberrant expression is maintained after
metastatic migration of colon cancer cells to the liver which
does not itself express OX1R in healthy conditions. We also
showed that activation of OX1R by exogenous orexins in colon
cancer cell lines established from primary tumors or metastases results in robust cell apoptosis and subsequent reduction in cell number. The proapoptotic action of orexins is also
instrumental in colon cancer cells which have been selected

Orexin Receptor in Colon Cancers and Liver Metastases

(21) for their ability to resist to the most commonly used drug
in colon cancer chemotherapy (i.e., 5-FU; refs. 4, 27). Finally,
orexins also strongly decrease the development of tumors in
vivo in 2 models of colon cancer cells xenografted in nude
mice. Altogether our data suggested that the orexin receptor
OX1R represents a new promising gate to apoptosis in colon
cancers which could be openable by exogenous orexins or
OX1R agonists.
The molecular mechanisms whereby OX1R is aberrantly
expressed during colon cancer progression are still unknown.
The gene encoding OX1R maps to the human chromosomal
region 1p33 (7). Chromosome 1p and the 1p32-36 loci have
been shown to undergo genetic changes including deletions in
human colorectal tumorigenesis (28). It could be hypothesized
that deletions in chromosome 1 may hinder the repression of
OX1R gene that occurs in normal colon.
OX1Rs are expressed in all hepatic metastases of colorectal
cancer (Fig. 2) and in colon cancer cell lines established from
lymph nodes, ascite, or lung metastases (Fig. 3A). This is an
important point for 2 reasons: (i) The status of a given receptor
may be different in primary tumors and metastases. For
example, the EGFR status in primary colorectal tumors does
not correlate with EGFR expression in related metastatic sites
(29). A loss of EGFR expression was observed in a significant
number of lymph node and liver metastases (29, 30), an event
which has evident implication for treatment with EGFRtargeted antibodies (29). The status of OX1R appears to be
similar in primary colorectal tumors and liver metastases. This
is crucial if we consider that OX1R could represent a new
target in colon cancer therapy or for metastases imaging.
Indeed, the possibility to use OX1R-targeted agonists to
induce apoptosis of cancer cells is more relevant in metastases, including micrometastases, than in the primary tumor
which can be resected. (ii) The liver is the main site of
colorectal cancer metastasis. The status of OX1R in hepatic
metastases appears to be suitable for imaging of micrometastases. The high affinity of OX1R for orexins makes this
target convenient for radioisotopic imaging with 111In-labeled
OX1R agonists as described previously for in vivo imaging of
tumors with radiolabeled peptides (31). For imaging, it is also
crucial that normal liver cells do not express OX1R (Fig. 2). In
that respect, OX1R appears to be much more interesting for
imaging than vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) receptors
(32) which are not only expressed in colon cancers (33) but
also highly expressed throughout the normal human gut (34,
35) and liver (36).
The current view of the 7-pass transmembrane OX1R
mediating apoptosis follows a mechanism that involves orexin
binding at the plasma membrane triggering tyrosine phosphorylation of 2 tyrosine-based motifs ITIM (15) and ITSM
(16) in OX1R and subsequent recruitment and activation of
the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 (13, 15, 16). The first steps of
OX1R-driven apoptosis appear to occur at the plasma membrane level in agreement with the localization of OX1R at the
cell surface of tumors and cultured cells. However, OX1R was
also detected intracellularly in cytoplasm and/or nucleus in
colon tumors and HT29 cells. The reason why OX1R is
expressed intracellularly in colon cancers and its biological

www.aacrjournals.org

significance, if any, are not known. Many GPCRs have been
shown to be resident at intracellular sites (37–39). The presence of intracellular GPCRs in colon cancer cells has been
previously reported for other peptide receptors (40) and
alteration of receptor trafficking in cancer cells has been
reported (41).
Failure of tumor cells to undergo apoptosis translates into
malignant potential and chemotherapeutic resistance (18).
Any means to selectively induce apoptosis of cancer cells
versus normal cells should be considered as of tremendous
interest (42). The ability of orexins to promote apoptosis in
colon cancer cells in culture is well correlated to the expression of OX1R mRNA supporting the idea that OX1R level is
determinant for the induction of apoptosis. Because all colorectal tumors and hepatic metastases express OX1R, the tumor
cells should be amenable to apoptosis in vivo if simulated by
OX1R agonists. Most of the colon cancer cell lines established
from primary tumors or metastases undergo apoptosis on
challenge with orexins. In contrast, normal colonic epithelial
cells and liver cells do not express OX1R and do not undergo
orexin-induced apoptosis thereby (6). This represents an
important feature in view of the possible use of OX1R as a
therapeutic target. OX1Rs induce apoptosis through the
intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway (6). Colon cancer cells
also express Fas receptors (43) which, as death receptors,
induce apoptosis through the extrinsic apoptosis pathway (17,
18, 42). Unfortunately, most colon cancer cell lines are resistant to Fas ligand–mediated apoptosis even if they are positive
to FasR (18). In contrast, normal colonic cells and hepatocytes
remain exquisitely sensitive to Fas-mediated apoptosis (18)
strongly limiting the potential use of FasR agonists as candidates for chemotherapeutic intervention (18). Attempts to use
TNF and Fas ligand as an apoptosis-based therapy in colon
cancer have also been thwarted by induction of NF-kB–
mediated inflammation and fulminant hepatic failure, respectively (42). The OX1R clearly does not suffer from such limits,
as orexins do decrease tumor development in vivo in models of
human colon cancer cells xenografted in nude mice and do
not bring about any observable adverse effect upon long-term
treatment whatever the doses of orexin-A used up to 11.2
mmoles/kg.
In vivo experiments with human colon cancer cells
xenografted in nude mice show that orexin-A is very
efficient in slowing the tumor growth. It works at a dose
as low as 0.112 mmoles/kg and reaches a maximal effect at
1.12 mmoles/kg. Not only orexin-A is able to drastically slow
tumor growth when administered at the same time as cell
inoculation (day 0), but most interestingly, it also reverses
very rapidly the growth of already established tumors (see
Fig. 5B). It has been shown previously that orexins inhibit
cultured colon cancer cell growth by inducing apoptosis
without altering cell cycle (6). It is likely that orexins also
reduced tumor growth in vivo by promoting apoptosis,
as we showed by immunostaining (see Supplementary
Fig. S4) that caspase-3 is activated in tumors upon orexin
treatment.
The orexin receptor OX1R in colon cancer might be
considered as a new type of gene in cancer, as it is aberrantly

expressed as a functional protein whose function, when
activated by an agonist, is to promote apoptosis of the
cancer cell. The colon cancer cells unexpectedly provide a
new gate to promote their death by apoptosis which was not
present in the normal colonocyte from which they derive. In
this context, an important question arises: are OX1Rs activated in colorectal primary tumors or metastases in vivo?
Several lines of evidence support that the answer is no: (i)
Colon tumors do not express the orexin precursor mRNA,
suggesting that OX1Rs in colon cancer cells might not be
activated by an autocrine loop. (ii) The major source of
orexins is the hypothalamus. The sites of synthesis of orexins
in the periphery are still debatable (11, 13). Although early
immunohistochemical studies detected orexins in small
intestine, stomach and pancreas in rodents (26), further
qRT-PCR experiments identified orexin precursor mRNA
in rat testis but not in most other peripheral tissues including gut and liver (12). In this article, we have shown that
normal human colonic mucosa and liver tissues do not
express the orexin precursor mRNA. (iii) A few studies
reported the radioimmunologic detection of very low concentrations of orexin-A in human plasma but results
between laboratories probably need to be interpreted with
caution (11). Anyway, the reported levels of orexin-A in
human plasma are very low, in the range between 2 and
40 pmol/L, in comparison of the Kd of the human OX1R (i.e.,
7 nmol/L; ref. 16), making very unlikely that the elusive
blood-borne orexins can activate OX1R in colon cancer.
Altogether, our data and the literature suggest that the
OX1Rs aberrantly expressed in colon cancer cells are most
probably not activated by endogenous orexins in vivo. Therefore, it may be suggested that OX1Rs in colorectal cancer
constitute a gate to apoptosis which probably remains
unopened in vivo but could be openable by therapeutic
administration of exogenous orexins or OX1R agonists.

The development of long-lived peptide agonists or nonpeptide agonists of orexin receptors will represent an important
advance not only in neuroscience (44) but also in colon
cancer research. The OX1R, orexins and forthcoming OX1R
agonists might be novel candidates for colorectal cancer
therapy.
In conclusion, we provide evidence that OX1R is aberrantly
expressed in all primary colorectal tumors and metastases and
that its activation by exogenous orexins result in robust
apoptosis of colon cancer cells in culture and strong decrease
of tumor development in mice xenografted with colon cancer
cells in vivo. Another remarkable property of OX1R-mediated
apoptosis in colon cancer cells is that it remains efficient in
HT29-FU cells that have been selected for their ability to resist
to 5-FU. In this context, the orexin receptor OX1R represents
an Achilles heel of colon cancer and is a new promising
therapeutic target.
