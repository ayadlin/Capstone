ABSTRACT
In situ models of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-induced carcinoma
develop into metastatic carcinoma, which is associated with drug resistance and
disease recurrence in human breast cancer. Ras GTPase-activating protein SH3
domain-binding protein 1 (G3BP1), an essential Ras mediator, has been implicated
in cancer development, including cell growth, motility, invasion and apoptosis. Here,
we demonstrated that the upregulation of G3BP1 activates the EMT in breast cancer
cells. Silencing Smads almost completely blocked this G3BP1-induced EMT, suggesting
that this process depends on the Smad signaling pathway. We also found that G3BP1
interacted with the Smad complex. Based on these results, we proposed that G3BP1
might act as a novel co-factor of Smads by regulating their phosphorylation status.
Moreover, knockdown of G3BP1 suppressed the mesenchymal phenotype of MDAMB-231 cells in vitro and suppressed tumor growth and lung metastasis of 4T1 cells
in vivo. Our findings identified a novel function of G3BP1 in the progression of breast
cancer via activation of the EMT, indicating that G3BP1 might represent a potential
therapeutic target for metastatic human breast cancer.

Many signaling pathways participate in the EMT,
including the TGF-β, Notch, Ras, Wnt and Hedgehog
signaling pathways [5, 6], and the Smad signaling is
necessary for TGF-β-induced EMT. Smads interact
with EMT-promoting transcription factors that comprise
epithelial repressors, such as Snail, Twist and Zeb, and
mesenchymal activators (MeA), including β-catenin, AP-1
and TCF, resulting in the formation of EMT-promoting
Smad complexes (EPSCs) to induce the EMT [7].
Moreover, ectopic Smad2 or Smad3, in combination with
Smad4, enhances TGF-β-induced EMT, whereas dominantnegative Smad2, Smad3, or Smad4 blocks the TGF-βinduced EMT in NMuMG breast epithelial cells [8, 9].
G3BP1
was
initially
identified
as
a
ubiquitously expressed cytosolic 68 kDa protein that
co-immunoprecipitates with the GAP SH3 domain [10].

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, breast cancer has become the most
common and fatal cancer among women worldwide [1].
The predominant cause of death and obstacle to successful
treatment of this disease is metastasis. Because the
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) can convert
benign tumors into invasive and metastatic tumors, it
plays a critical role in the regulation of tumor progression
and metastasis [2–4]. The EMT is a developmental
process that enables polarized epithelial cells to undergo
multiple biochemical changes to exhibit the phenotypes
of mesenchymal cells, including enhanced migratory and
invasive capacities and elevated resistance to apoptosis [2].

Because RasGAP is the primary negative regulator of Ras
and because the RasGAP SH3 domain is important for
oncogenic Ras signaling pathways [11], G3BP has been
implicated in regulation of the Ras signaling pathway.
Both G3BP1 and G3BP2 are dramatically overexpressed
in human cancers, especially breast cancer, suggesting
that they may be related to cancer progression [12, 13].
Recent evidence has suggested that the overexpression of
the N-terminal of G3BP enhanced the motility and invasion
of PDAC cells [14, 15]. Previously, we demonstrated that
G3BP knockdown inhibited HCT116 cell growth via the
induction of apoptosis [16]. Furthermore, we reported that
G3BP knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion
of H1299 cells by suppressing the Src/FAK-associated
signaling pathway [17]. This evidence suggested that
G3BP1 may participate in the regulation of cell invasion
and migration.
Therefore, in this study, we hypothesized that
G3BP1 participates in the EMT to induce tumor metastasis
in human breast cancer. Because G3BP1 is overexpressed
during breast cancer, we aimed to investigate whether
G3BP1 was involved in the EMT and to elucidate the
mechanism by which G3BP1 regulates tumor metastasis
in human breast cancer.

EMT markers via western blot and immunofluorescence
staining. As shown in Figure 1B and 1D, expression of the
epithelial cell-cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin and the
intermediate filament protein Keratin 19 was dramatically
decreased, whereas the mesenchymal markers Fibronectin
and Vimentin were significantly upregulated in G3BP1overexpressing clones. Several transcription factors, such
as SIP1, Snail1 (Snail), Snail2 (Slug), and ZEB1, inhibit
E-cadherin expression, which serves as a key event in the
disruption of tight cell-cell contacts, thereby activating the
EMT. Consistently, overexpression of G3BP1 increased
the levels of Snail, Slug and ZEB1. Taken together, our
data indicated that overexpression of G3BP1 induced the
EMT in MDCK cells.

Overexpression of G3BP1 induces the EMT in
MCF-7 cells
To investigate the role of G3BP1 in breast cancer
progression, G3BP1 was overexpressed in MCF-7 human
breast cancer cells, and the levels of EMT markers
were then examined. The results showed that MCF-7
cells transiently transfected with G3BP1 exhibiting a
mesenchymal-like phenotype (Figure 2A, left). As shown
in Figure 2A on the right, expression of the epithelial
markers E-cadherin and Keratin 19 was decreased, whereas
that of the mesenchymal markers Fibronectin, Vimentin,
Snail, Slug and ZEB1 was increased, indicating that
overexpression of G3BP1 induced the EMT in MCF-7
cells. Moreover, overexpression of G3BP1 significantly
promoted MCF-7 cell migration and invasion (Figure 2B).
In addition, we established two stably G3BP1overexpressing clones (G3BP1(+)-1 and G3BP1(+)-2) and a
Mock clone transfected with an empty vector. Consistently,
the stably G3BP1-overexpressing clones exhibited a
mesenchymal-like phenotype and enhanced migratory and
invasion capacities compared with those of the Mock clone
(Figure 2C and 2E). Moreover, expression of the epithelial
markers E-cadherin and Keratin 19 was decreased and that of
the mesenchymal markers Fibronectin, Vimentin, Snail, Slug
and Zeb1 was increased, suggesting that overexpression of
G3BP1 induced the EMT in MCF-7 cells (Figure 2D).

RESULTS
Overexpression of G3BP1 induces the EMT in
MDCK cells
Polarized MDCK epithelial cells converted into
migratory fibroblasts in response to the addition of
conditioned medium from cultured fibroblasts; this
method has been used extensively as a model of the
EMT in vitro[18]. Therefore, we employed this model
to investigate whether overexpression of G3BP1 could
induce EMT and enhance the migration and invasion
of MDCK cells. By transfecting with pCDNA3.1G3BP1, we generated two stably G3BP1-overexpressing
MDCK cell lines that displayed increased expression of
G3BP1 compared with MDCK cells transfected with the
pCDNA3.1-Mock vector (Figure 1B and 1D). Concomitant
with the increase in G3BP1 expression, characteristic
morphological changes associated with the EMT were
observed in the G3BP1(+) clones. The stably G3BP1overexpressing cells exhibited a spindle-like rather than
cobblestone-like fibroblast morphology (Figure 1A).
Moreover, the two stably G3BP1-overexpressing cell
lines grew despite the lack of intercellular tight junctions,
indicating a mesenchymal-like phenotype, whereas the
Mock vector-transfected cells maintained their cobblestonelike phenotype in the presence of strong cell-cell adhesions.
Our results also demonstrated that G3BP1 promoted
MDCK cell migration and invasion (Figure 1C). Enhanced
migratory capacity and invasiveness characterize cells
that have undergone the EMT. To address whether
G3BP1 induces the EMT, we then examined the levels of

Downregulation of G3BP1 suppresses the
mesenchymal phenotype in MDA-MB-231 cells
The above results demonstrated that overexpression
of G3BP1 induced the EMT in MDCK and MCF-7 cells.
To verify whether these changes associated with the EMT
were specifically induced by G3BP1, the G3BP1 gene was
silenced using siRNA in highly metastatic MDA-MB-231
breast cancer cells. We found that G3BP1 knockdown
decreased the levels of the mesenchymal markers and
increased the levels of the epithelial markers (Figure 3A,
right). Consistent with these changes of EMT markers,
the G3BP1-silenced MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited tight
cell clusters (Figure 3A, left) and decreased cell migration

stably G3BP1 shRNA-expressing clones (G3BP1(-)-1
and G3BP1(-)-2) by transfecting the pGU6/neo-shG3BP1
or pGU6/neo-control vector into MDA-MB-231 cells.
Consistently, the results indicated that the stably G3BP1silenced clones exhibited an epithelial-like phenotype
(Figure 3C); expression of the epithelial markers E-cadherin
and Keratin 19 was increased and that of the mesenchymal
markers Vimentin, Snail, Slug, Fibronectin and ZEB1
was decreased (Figure 3D). Moreover, the migratory and
invasion capacities were significantly reduced (Figure 3E).
Taken together, these results suggested that downregulation
of G3BP1 suppressed the EMT.

pathway, we investigated whether G3BP1-mediated
EMT depends on the absence or presence of TGF-β. As
expected, we found that G3BP1 knockdown abolished
the TGF-β-induced EMT in MCF-7 cells (Figure S3A).
In addition, knockdown of G3BP1 significantly inhibited
TGF-β-induced cell migration and invasion (Figure S3B)
which further suggested an important role of G3BP1 in
the regulation of TGF-β-induced EMT. These results also
indicated that the regulation of G3BP1 on EMT in MCF-7
cells didn’t depend on the absence or presence of TGF-β.
Given that activated Smads could upregulate EMT
associated transcription factors Snail, Slug and Zeb1
expression [19], we wondered which transcription factors
contributed to G3BP1-induced EMT. We then examined
the translocation of Smads induced by G3BP1 via
western blotting in MCF-7 cells. As shown in Figure S4,
G3BP1 promoted the shuttle of Smads from cytoplasm to
nucleus which agreed with the changes in the expression
of Snail1, Slug and ZEB1(Figure 2A, right). Moreover,
upregulation of G3BP1 promoted the transcriptional
expression of SNAIL, SLUG and ZEB1 (Figure 4H). The
most remarkable change in mRNA expression was SLUG,
thus we assumed Slug plays the most important role in
G3BP1-induced EMT. Furthermore, we co-transfected
siRNA-Slug and pCDNA3.1- G3BP1 in MCF-7 cells,
and found that knockdown of Slug could reverse G3BP1
mediated EMT (Figure 4I).
Taken together, these results demonstrate that
G3BP1 overexpression contributes to the activation
of Smads, which induces EMT transcription factors
expression. Slug plays the most important role in G3BPinduced EMTs in MCF-7 cells.

Smads activation and Slug upregulation
mediated G3BP1-induced EMT
To further explore the mechanism of the G3BP1induced EMT, we focused on the Smad signaling pathway,
which is known to play a major role in EMT-induced cancer
progression and metastasis. We hypothesized that G3BP1
participates in the Smad signaling pathway to mediate
the EMT. To address this hypothesis, we examined the
effect of G3BP1 on the Smad signaling pathway by either
overexpressing G3BP1 in MCF-7 cells or silencing G3BP1
in MDA-MB-231 cells. Transiently increasing G3BP1
expression caused a dramatic activation of Smad2/3 in
MCF-7 cells compared with Mock-treated MCF-7 cells
(Figure 4A). To further confirm that G3BP1 activates
Smads, we used siRNA or shRNA to knock down G3BP1
expression. Transfection with G3BP1 siRNA resulted in a
substantial decrease in Smad2/3 phosphorylation in MDAMB-231 cells (Figure 4D), suggesting that G3BP1 was
required for Smad activation. Similarly, the phosphorylation
of Smad2 and Smad3 was increased in stably G3BP1overexpressing MCF-7 cell clones (Figure 4C), whereas
it was decreased in stably G3BP1-downregulated MDAMB-231 cell clones (Figure 4F).
Next, TGF-β was also introduced into different
human breast cancer cell lines. We found that Smad2/3
phosphorylation was significantly increased in both TGFβ-treated MCF-7/G3BP1(+) and MCF-7/Mock cells
compared with TGF-β-untreated cells (Figure 4B). This
stimulatory effect was dramatically enhanced in G3BP1overexpressing MCF-7/G3BP1(+) cells compared with
MCF-7/Mock cells. However, the TGF-β-mediated
increase in Smad2/3 phosphorylation was detected in
MDA-MB-231/Mock cells but not in MDA-MB-231/
G3BP1(-) cells (Figure 4E). Moreover, GAP161, a
G3BP1-targeting peptide that inhibits G3BP1 and
displays promising anti-cancer activity [16], was applied
to MDA-MB-231 cells. Following the downregulation
of G3BP1 in response to GAP161, the phosphorylation
of Smad2 and Smad3 was decreased (Figure 4G). These
data indicated that G3BP1 participated in the regulation
of Smad signaling pathway. To extend our finding that
G3BP1 mediated the activation of the Smad signaling

G3BP1 interacts with smads
Because G3BP1 affected the phosphorylation of
Smad2 and Smad3, we hypothesized that G3BP1 plays
a direct role in recruiting Smad signaling molecules.
Endogenous interactions between G3BP1 and Smad2/3/4
were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assay in MDAMB-231 cells (Figure 5A). These interactions were also
found in MCF-7 cells (data not shown). The results of the
reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation suggested that G3BP1
activated Smad signaling by recruiting the Smad2/3 complex.
To identify which component directly bound to G3BP1,
we repeated co-immunoprecipitation assay using various
antibodies and lysates from MDA-MB-231 cells transfected
with siRNA targeting Smad2, Smad3 or Smad4. The results
indicated that knockdown of Smad2 and Smad4, but not
Smad3, disrupted the G3BP1-Smad interactions, suggesting
that G3BP1 directly binds to the Smad2/4 complex (Figure
5B). Together, our data suggest that G3BP1 acts as a novel
binding partner to the Smad complex that activates Smad
signaling by recruiting the Smad2/4 complex.
We next determined whether Smads were necessary
for G3BP1-induced EMT. MCF-7 cells were transfected
with pCDNA3.1-G3BP1 together with siRNA targeting

reduced the mesenchymal phenotype (Figure 6A and 6B,

after 4T1 cell inoculation, the 4T1-luc/Mock tumors
induced significantly increased bioluminescent signals
at primary and secondary sites (primarily in the lungs),
whereas the G3BP1-knockdown 4T1/G3BP1(-) tumors
were smaller at the primary site and were noninvasive at
secondary sites (Figure 7A). As shown in Figure 7B, the
average weight of the 4T1/Mock tumors was much larger
than that of the 4T1-luc/G3BP1(-)-1, 4T1-luc/G3BP1
(-)-2 and 4T1-luc/G3BP1(-)-1/2 tumors, suggesting that
G3BP1 significantly promoted tumorigenesis and growth
in this orthotopic breast cancer model and that G3BP1
downregulation suppressed primary tumor growth.
Furthermore, the 4T1-luc/G3BP1(-) tumors formed no
visible metastases, whereas the hosts of the 4T1-luc/
Mock cells exhibited an average of 12 metastatic nodules
in the lungs (Figure 7C and 7E, upper).
Metastases in the lungs of mice carrying tumors were
confirmed via H&E staining and the lung weight (Figure 7D
and 7E, lower). We found many micrometastases in the lungs
of mice carrying Mock tumors, in stark contrast with the
few micrometastases detected in the lungs of mice carrying
G3BP1(-)-1, G3BP1(-)-2 or G3BP1(-)-1/2 tumors. Next, we
confirmed that the G3BP1(-)-1, G3BP1(-)-2, G3BP1(-)-1/2
and Mock tumors continued to maintain their epithelial or
mesenchymal phenotypes in vivo. As shown in Figure 7F,
the Mock tumors maintained high expression of G3BP1
post-implantation, whereas the G3BP1(-)-1, G3BP1(-)-2
and G3BP1(-)-1/2 tumors displayed negligible expression of
G3BP1. The G3BP1-downregulated tumors also displayed
positive expression of E-cadherin and Keratin19, whereas
the Mock tumors were positive for Fibronectin. Furthermore,
expression of the transcription factors that regulate
E-cadherin, such as Snail, Slug and ZEB1, was significantly
decreased in G3BP1-downregulated tumors. Taken together,
these data suggested that the downregulation of G3BP1
suppressed 4T1 tumor growth and metastasis in vivo.

and tumorigenesis, TGF-β was the first inducer demonstrated
to activate the EMT in mammary epithelial cells [24].
In response to TGF-β, TβR-I is phosphorylated by TβRII,
leading to the C-terminal phosphorylation of Smad2 and
Smad3, which then form a trimer with Smad4 and translocate
into the nucleus to associate and cooperate with DNA-binding
transcription factors to regulate target gene transcription [25].
In this study, we found that G3BP1 involved in the activation
of Smad signaling pathway. Overexpression of G3BP1
enhanced the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3, whereas
downregulation of G3BP1 attenuated the phosphorylation of
Smads in the presence or absence of exogenous TGF-β1.
TGF-β1 plays an important role in inducing EMT, we also
found that silencing G3BP1 abrogated the TGF-β-induced
EMT process (Figure S3A, B), which indicated that G3BP1
is crucial for TGF-β-induced EMT.
The RT-PCR results revealed that the mRNA
expression levels of TGFBR2 and TGFB1 were
upregulated in G3BP1-overexpressing MCF-7 cells
(Figure S2). Silencing G3BP1 attenuated the activation
of Smad2/3 without altering the expression of TβRII or
TGF-β1. We speculated that this enhanced expression of
TβRII and TGF-β1 occurred due to feedback activation
in response to the G3BP1-mediated activation of
Smad2/3.
The activated Smads induce EMT via three families
of transcription factors, resulting in repression of epithelial
marker gene expression and activation of mesenchymal
gene expression. We found that overexpressed G3BP1
increased nuclear localized activated Smads, which
may promoted the transcriptional expression of SNAIL,
SLUG and ZEB1. And Slug played the most important
role as knockdown of Slug inhibited the G3BP1-induced
changes in the expression of marker genes (Figure 4I).
E-cadherin repressor Slug is reported to overexpress in
numerous cancer and promote cancer cells to become
motile and invasive through downregulating epithelial
markers and upregulating mesenchymal markers [26].
As Smad complex binds to the promoter of Slug and
induces expression of Slug [27], we speculated that
G3BP1 promoted the EMT mainly via the activated Smads
through the upregulation of Slug.
Although Smad2 and Smad3 are key elements
in the Smad signaling pathway, they may play distinct
roles in the induction of the EMT in breast cancer.
A recent study reported that the activation of Smad3,
but not Smad2, was essential to induce the EMT in
normal mammary epithelial cells [28]. Likewise,
Smad2 knockdown strikingly enhances metastatic
potential, whereas the loss of Smad3 prolongs the
latency and delays the growth of bone metastases in
MDA-MB-231 cells [29].Those reports indicate that
Smad3 is more critical than Smad2 for induction of
the EMT during breast cancer. In addition, Smad4 is
necessary for the TGF-β-induced EMT and metastasis
of breast cancer cells to bone [30]. We got similar result

DISCUSSION
We previously reported that G3BPs played an important
role in inducing the invasion and metastasis of human lung
cancer H1299 cells via the Src/FAK-associated signaling
pathway [17]. In this study, the overexpression of G3BP1
induced the EMT in a model of MDCK cells. Although
G3BP1 was overexpressed in many tumor samples compared
to healthy tissue [21], the up-regulation of G3BP1 promoted
an invasive and metastatic phenotype in non-metastatic
breast cancer MCF-7 cells, whereas the down-regulation of
G3BP1 suppressed this invasive and metastatic phenotype in
metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Despite previous
reports demonstrating that G3BP1 was associated with cell
motility and invasion [14, 22], our study provided the first
evidence that G3BP1 mediates the EMT in breast cancer cells.
The EMT was initially described in the early 1980s by
Elizabeth Hay [23]. Although a variety of factors and signals
have been shown to induce the EMT during embryogenesis

METHODS

shown in Figure S1 that Smad3 knockdown strikingly
affected the expression of EMT marker genes. To
validate which Smad is critically responsible for the
G3BP1-induced EMT, we used multiple Smad-targeted
siRNAs to transiently knock down various Smads.
We also found that knockdown of specific Smads
influenced the expression of various EMT markers
during G3BP1 overexpression. G3BP1 failed to alter
the expression of these EMT markers following Smad
knockdown, verifying that G3BP1 acts upstream of the
Smads and induces the EMT via the Smad signaling
pathway. As shown in Figure 5C, Smad3 knockdown
nearly abolished the G3BP1-mediated changes in the
expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers, and
silencing Smad2/4 partially blocked these changes. We
speculate that Smad3 is more crucial than Smad2/4 for
the G3BP1-induced EMT in breast cancer.
The in vivo co-immunoprecipitation assay
indicated that G3BP1 co-precipitated with Smad2,
Smad3 and Smad4 and that these interactions similarly
occurred via the Smad complex. As noted above, G3BP1
may interact with the Smad2/4 and Smad3/4 complexes.
Individually silencing the Smads to elucidate their
direct interactions with G3BP1 suggested that G3BP1
binds to Smad2/4. G3BP1, which is necessary for the
phosphorylation of Smad2/3, might act as a novel cofactor to regulate the phosphorylation status of Smads.
It will be interesting to investigate how the co-factor
G3BP1 acts on Smads.
Aside from these in vitro experiments on the
G3BP1-induced EMT, we evaluated the G3BP1mediated regulation of primary tumor metastasis
in vivo. Our data indicated that G3BP1 downregulation
suppressed primary tumor growth and lung metastasis of
mouse 4T1 breast cancer cells. Thus, G3BP1 knockdown
inhibited breast cancer metastasis to the lungs. We
have previously demonstrated that the RasGAPderived peptides 38GAP and GAP159 potentiate the
cytotoxicity of cisplatin to HCT116 cells [16, 31, 32].
Herein, GAP161 inhibited the expression of G3BP1 and
attenuated the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 in
a dose-dependent manner, consistent with the results of
G3BP1 siRNA treatment (Figure 4D). Thus, GAP161
may represent a novel therapeutic agent for breast
cancer metastasis.
The EMT is a complex process that is associated
with the initiation of cancer stem cells and increases
in cell aggressiveness, invasion and metastasis, drug
resistance and disease recurrence in breast cancer and
other carcinomas regulated by the Smad signaling
pathway [33–36]. In the present study, we provided
the first evidence that G3BP1 induces the EMT via the
Smad signaling pathway. Moreover, our study not only
elucidated the mechanism by which G3BP1 induces the
EMT but also provided a potential therapeutic target for
the invasion and metastasis of breast cancer.

Cell culture
The Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK), MDAMB-231 (human breast cancer), MCF-7 (human breast
cancer), human embryonic kidney (HEK)293T and 4T1luc (mouse breast cancer) cell lines were purchased from
the Cell Culture Center of Peking Union Medical College
(Beijing, China). The MDCK, MCF-7 and HEK-293T
cells were cultured in DMEM (HyClone, Logan, UT,
USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (TBD,
Tianjin, China).The 4T1-luc cells were cultured in 1640
medium (HyClone) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (TBD). The MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in
L-15 medium (HyClone) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (Gibco, US). All cultures were routinely
tested for mycoplasma and for the retention of their
respective morphology and growth characteristics.

Plasmids and cell lines
pCDNA3.1-G3BP1 was generated via PCR and
confirmed via sequencing analysis. Stable cell lines
were selected using hygromycin. G3BP1 shRNAs were
synthesized and cloned into the pGPU6/Hygro vector
by Shanghai GenePharm (Shanghai, China) as described
previously [17]. Stable transfectants were identified via
selection using G418.

siRNA interference and transfection
The siRNA sequences used were synthesized
by Ribobio Technology (Guangzhou, China). The
siRNA sequences were as follows: G3BP1, 5′-GCAA
CAGUAUUUCGGUAUAdTdT-3′; Smad2, 5′-GGUGA
AGAAGCUAAAGAAAdTdT-3′; Smad3, 5′-CCGCAU
GAGCUUCGUCAAAdTdT-3′; Smad4, 5′-GCC AUAGU
GAAGGACUGUUdTdT-3′; SLUG, 5′-GCAUUUGCA
GACAGGUCAAdTdT-3′ and control Mock siRNA,
5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUdTdT-3′. Cells at 40–
60% confluence in six-well culture dishes were transfected
with siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Alternatively, cells at 40–60% confluence
were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmid
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Reagents and antibodies
TGF-β1 was purchased from R&D Systems
(Minneapolis, MN, USA). The cell-permeable peptide
GAP161 was synthesized by Wuhan KatyGen Pharma­
ceuticals (Hubei, China). These peptides were dissolved
in deionized water at a final concentration of 10 mM

their suppliers included the following: G3BP1 (TT-Y)
for immunoprecipitation and G3BP1 (H-10) for immunoblot
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA);
E-cadherin from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington,
KY, USA); Keratin 17/19, Vimentin, Slug, Snail, ZEB1,
Smad2, Smad3, phospho-Smad2 (Ser465/467), phosphoSmad3 (Ser423/425) and β-actin from Cell Signaling
Technology (Danvers, MA, USA); and Fibronectin from
Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA).

The 6- to 8-week-old female mice (BALB/c) were
purchased from the Institute for Experimental Animals
of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (Beijing,
China). The 4T1-luc cells were suspended at a final
concentration of 5.0 × 106 cells/mL in PBS, and 5.0 ×
105 4T1-luc cells in 0.1 mL of PBS were injected into
the second mammary fat pad. On day 41, the mammary
tumors and lungs were removed and weighed. The lungs
were fixed in formalin overnight before evaluating lung
metastasis, and the numbers of metastatic nodules on the
lung surface were counted. For histological examination,
the primary tumor was sectioned into two parts. One half
was used for western blot analysis; the other half and the
lungs were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin
blocks for slicing into thin sections. The paraffinized
sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
according to standard protocols. The stained sections
were photographed using a Leica microscope (Leica,
Wetzlar, Germany).

Immunoprecipitation and western blot
Cell supernatants were harvested and lysed in RIPA
buffer (Cell Signaling Technology) 48 h after treatment,
and the protein concentration was determined using an
Enhanced BCA Protein assay kit (Beyotime, Jiangsu,
China). Then, 1 mg of total protein was subjected to
immunoprecipitation using the appropriate antibodies
as indicated overnight at 4°C with gentle agitation,
followed by incubation in Protein A/G PLUS-Agarose
(Santa Cruz, CA, USA) for 4–6 hours at 4°C. For western
blot, the precipitated proteins or whole-cell lysates were
subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA,
USA). The membranes were then probed with the
indicated antibodies, and the immunoreactive bands were
developed using an ECL detection system (Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA).

Optical imaging and histological analysis
On day 41, before euthanizing the mice, an optical
molecular imaging system was used to evaluate primary
tumor growth and metastasis. The luciferase substrate
D-luciferin (150 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally, and
the animals were placed into a warmed stage inside the
camera box of an IVIS Imaging System (Xenogen, Alameda,
CA, USA) to observe the tumor and the lungs. Measurements
were performed as previously described [37].

Immunofluorescence
MDCK cells and their derivatives were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton-X100
and blocked in 5% BSA. The slides were then incubated
in primary antibodies overnight at 4°C followed by
Alexa Fluor 488- and/or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated
secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). The nuclei were
stained with Hoechst 33258. Images were obtained under
a fluorescence microscope (TE2000-U, Nikon) and were
analyzed using the corresponding software.
