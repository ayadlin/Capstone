Abstract
Protein kinase C-D (PKCD) plays an important role in DNA
damage–induced apoptosis. We have previously shown that the
PKCD inhibitor rottlerin protects against cisplatin-induced
apoptosis acting upstream of caspase-9. In the present study,
we have investigated if rottlerin regulates caspase-2 activation.
Knockdown of caspase-2 by siRNA inhibited processing of
apical caspase-9 and caspase-8, whereas depletion of caspase-9
had little effect on caspase-2 processing. Rottlerin inhibited
activation and processing of caspase-9 and caspase-8 and
cleavage of poly(ADP)ribose polymerase. We made a novel observation that rottlerin induced down-regulation of caspase-2
but not of caspase-3, caspase-7, caspase-8, or caspase-9. Pharmacologic inhibitors of PKC, such as Gö 6983 and bisindolylmaleimide, or depletion of PKCD by siRNA had no effect on
the down-regulation of caspase-2 by rottlerin. The proteasome
inhibitor MG132 reversed caspase-2 down-regulation by rottlerin, whereas calpain inhibitor had no effect. These results
suggest that rottlerin induces down-regulation of caspase-2 via
PKCD-independent but ubiquitin proteasome–mediated pathway. Furthermore, down-regulation of caspase-2 by rottlerin
can explain its antiapoptotic function during DNA damage–
induced apoptosis. [Cancer Res 2008;68(8):2795–802]

Introduction

Materials and Methods

Apoptosis is a genetically determined cell suicidal program that
removes unwanted, redundant, and damaged cells and is required
to maintain a balance between cell proliferation and cell death (1).
Apoptosis is initiated by the activation of caspases, a family of
interleukin-1h converting enzyme–like cysteine proteases that
specifically cleave proteins after aspartate residues (2–4). Whereas
caspase-8 and caspase-9 participate in the initiation phase of
apoptosis, caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7 are involved in the
execution phase of apoptosis. Activation of these executioner
caspases results in the cleavage of critical cellular proteins,
including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), DNA-dependent
protein kinase, lamin B, and protein kinase C-y (PKCy; refs. 3, 5).
Caspase-2 is a unique caspase that can serve both as initiator and
executioner caspase (6–10).
There are two major pathways of cell death. The extrinsic
pathway is triggered by binding of ligand to members of tumor
necrosis factor-a receptor superfamily, causing activation of
procaspase-8 followed by activation of a caspase cascade (11).
DNA-damaging agents are known to activate the intrinsic or

mitochondrial pathway by inducing the release of mitochondrial
cytochrome c, which allows Apaf-1 to interact with the initiator
procaspase-9 to form an active apoptosome complex, resulting in
activation of effector caspases, such as caspase-3 and caspase-7
(4). Recent studies from various laboratories have established a
role for caspase-2 during genotoxic stress–induced apoptosis
(7, 12–25).
PKCy is a substrate for caspase-3, and it is believed that
proteolytic activation of PKCy is necessary for DNA damage–
induced apoptosis (26–29). We have previously shown that
rottlerin, a pharmacologic inhibitor of PKCy, inhibits activation
of caspase-3 and caspase-9 induced by the DNA-damaging
anticancer agent cisplatin (30, 31), suggesting that PKCy acts at
an early stage of DNA damage–induced apoptosis that precedes
activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9. Several studies showed that
caspase-2 is activated early in response to DNA damage acting
upstream of mitochondria, suggesting that it functions as an apical
caspase (7, 13, 21, 32, 33). Because rottlerin inhibits cisplatininduced processing of caspase-9, we wanted to know if it acts
upstream of caspase-2. We made a novel observation that rottlerininduced down-regulation of caspase-2 via ubiquitin proteasome–
mediated pathway. Furthermore, the ability of rottlerin to induce
caspase-2 down-regulation was independent of its ability to inhibit
PKCy.

were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to
PVDF membrane. Immunoblot analyses were performed as described
previously (30).

0.1% CHAPS, and 5% glycerol. The release of 7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (AFC) was measured at excitation wavelength 400 nm and
emission wavelength 505 nm using a SPECTRAMAX 340 microplate reader
(Molecular Devices) and SOFTmax PRO software.

Results
Rottlerin induces down-regulation of caspase-2. We have
previously shown that rottlerin acts upstream of caspase-9 during
cisplatin-induced apoptosis (31). Because caspase-2 has been
shown to act as an apical caspase during DNA damage–induced
apoptosis, we wanted to know if rottlerin acts upstream of

caspase-2. Figure 1 shows that caspase-2 siRNA effectively
depleted caspase-2 in HeLa cells and ovarian cancer 2008 cells
but it did not decrease the levels of other caspases, such as
caspase-8, caspase-9, (Fig. 1A), caspase-3, and caspase-7 (data not
shown). Because proteolytic processing of caspase-2 is not
essential for its activation (36), we also determined caspase
activity using a fluorogenic substrate of caspase-2. Both
constitutive and cisplatin-induced caspase-2 activity was attenuated in cells transfected with caspase-2 siRNA compared with
cells transfected with control siRNA (Fig. 1B). Depletion of
caspase-2 was associated with inhibition of cisplatin-induced
proteolytic processing of caspase-8 and caspase-9, and cleavage of
PARP and PKCy in both HeLa and 2008 cells (Fig. 1A). The effect
of caspase-2 knockdown on the inhibition of caspase activation
and cleavage of PARP or PKCy was more pronounced in HeLa
cells compared with 2008 cells, presumably because reduction of
caspase-2 level by siRNA was less in 2008 cells compared with
HeLa cells. These results suggest that depletion of caspase-2
inhibits cisplatin-induced apoptosis.
Because caspase-9 is believed to be the initiator caspase during
DNA damage–induced apoptosis, we compared how depletion of

Results are representative of at least two separate experiments.

Figure 2. Effect of rottlerin on cisplatin-induced caspase activation. 2008 cells
were pretreated with 10 Amol/L rottlerin for 45 min and then treated with the
indicated concentrations of cisplatin for 20 h. Total cell lysates were processed
either for caspase activity assay using fluorogenic substrates (Table 1) or for
Western blot analysis. Arrows, processed forms. GAPDH was used to control for

caspase-2 or caspase-9 affects cisplatin-induced processing of each
other in HeLa cells (Fig. 1C). Although knockdown of caspase-2
decreased processing of caspase-8 and caspase-9, depletion of
caspase-9 did not decrease the processing of these caspases as
determined by the amount of cleaved caspases. Knockdown of
either caspase-2 or caspase-9 decreased cisplatin-induced cleavage
of PARP, although caspase-2 knockdown was more effective. These
results suggest that caspase-2 acts upstream of caspase-9 during
cisplatin-induced apoptosis.
We then examined the effect of rottlerin on cisplatin-induced
caspase activation. We monitored processing of caspases by
Western blot analysis (Fig. 2). Because activation of caspase-2 and
caspase-9 may not require proteolytic processing (36), we
analyzed samples from the same experiment for caspase activity
using fluorogenic peptide substrates (Table 1). Pretreatment of

2008 cells with rottlerin inhibited cisplatin-induced activation
of caspase-2, caspase-8, and caspase-9 (Table 1) and processing of
caspase-8 and caspase-9 (Fig. 2). Interestingly, rottlerin induced
down-regulation of caspase-2. Figure 3 shows that treatment of
HeLa cells with rottlerin for 7 hours or longer induced downregulation of caspase-2 but not of other caspases, such as
caspase-3, caspase-7, and caspase-9. We have previously shown
that cisplatin or rottlerin had no effect on caspase-2 using a
caspase-2 antibody purchased from Transduction Laboratories
(30). This antibody was later discontinued by the company. We
therefore used several antibodies that recognize different epitopes
to monitor down-regulation of caspase-2. These antibodies also
showed decrease in caspase-2 in cells treated with caspase-2
siRNA (Fig. 1A and C; data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3, both
mouse monoclonal antibody to caspase-2 obtained from BD
PharMingen and rat monoclonal antibody from Alexis showed
similar time course of caspase-2 down-regulation. Thus, the effect
of rottlerin on caspase-2 down-regulation was not due to epitope
masking.
The effect of rottlerin on caspase-2 down-regulation is
independent of PKCD inhibition. Because rottlerin is an
inhibitor of PKCy, we compared the effects of rottlerin with
other inhibitors of PKC on caspase-2 down-regulation. Whereas
rottlerin is believed to be a specific inhibitor of PKCy (37), BIM,
and Gö 6983 inhibit all PKC isozymes albeit with different
potencies (38). cPKCs are most sensitive and can be inhibited at
nanomolar concentrations, whereas nPKCs can be inhibited at
submicromolar concentrations in in vitro kinase assays. As shown
in Fig. 4A, rottlerin induced down-regulation of caspase-2 as well
as proteolytic processing of PKCy in both HeLa and 2008 cells.
Rottlerin alone caused a slight increase in proteolytic cleavage of
PKCy and PARP. This is consistent with our previous report that
rottlerin by itself could cause a small increase in cytochrome c
release (31). The PKC inhibitors Gö 6983 or BIM caused a modest
decrease in the proteolytic activation of PKCy as determined by
the levels of catalytic fragment (CF) of PKCy. These inhibitors,
however, had little effect on caspase-2 down-regulation in HeLa
cells.
Because rottlerin is a pharmacologic inhibitor and it may act
on additional targets besides PKCy, we also examined if depletion
of PKCy by siRNA leads to down-regulation of caspase-2. siRNA
against PKCy caused efficient depletion of PKCy in both HeLa
and 2008 (Fig. 4B) cells but did not affect the levels of other PKC
isozymes (data not shown). Knockdown of PKCy failed to induce
down-regulation of caspase-2 in these cells. In fact, depletion of
PKCy seems to increase caspase-2 level slightly. Furthermore,
rottlerin induced down-regulation of caspase-2 in PKCy-depleted

cells (Fig. 4B and C). These results suggest that the effect of
rottlerin on caspase-2 down-regulation was independent of PKCy.
Because PKCy functions as a proapoptotic protein and rottlerin
is believed to inhibit PKCy, we examined the consequence of PKCy
knockdown on the activation of caspases and cleavage of PARP in
HeLa cells. Figure 4D shows that cisplatin caused a concentrationdependent increase in the processing of caspase-2, caspase-8,
caspase-9, and caspase-3, and cleavage of PARP. PKCy siRNA
effectively depleted PKCy in HeLa cells. Although cisplatin caused a
concentration-dependent increase in the levels of catalytic
fragment of PKCy in control siRNA–transfected cells, we were
unable to detect PKCy-CF in cells transfected with PKCy siRNA.
Depletion of PKCy by siRNA, however, attenuated but did not
prevent processing of caspases and cleavage of PARP. PKCy
knockdown had little effect on the processing of caspases in 2008
cells (data not shown). Thus, the antiapoptotic effect of rottlerin
may be independent of PKCy.
Rottlerin induces caspase-2 down-regulation via the proteasome-mediated pathway. We then examined the mechanism
by which rottlerin induces down-regulation of caspase-2. Rottlerin
induced down-regulation of caspase-2 in both HeLa (Fig. 5A) and
2008 (Fig. 5B) cells but it did not induce down-regulation of
caspase-9, caspase-3, caspase-8, or caspase-7. We compared the
ability of several protease inhibitors in preventing caspase-2 downregulation by rottlerin in HeLa cells (Fig. 5A). Two different
proteasome inhibitors, MG132 and PSI, inhibited rottlerin-induced
down-regulation of caspase-2 in HeLa cells. ALLN, an inhibitor of
the proteasome, cathepsins, and calpains, also inhibited caspase-2
down-regulation by rottlerin. In contrast, the calpain inhibitor
calpeptin failed to prevent rottlerin-induced down-regulation of
caspase-2. Figure 5B shows that pretreatment of 2008 cells with
MG132 before rottlerin treatment also blocked rottlerin-induced
down-regulation of caspase-2. These results suggest that rottlerin
triggers caspase-2 down-regulation via the proteasome-mediated
pathway.
Because MG132 inhibited caspase-2 down-regulation by rottlerin,
we examined if MG132 could reverse the effect of rottlerin in
protecting cells against cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Figure 6A
shows that pretreatment of HeLa cells with MG132 before cisplatin
treatment enhanced caspase-2 processing and cleavage of PARP,
whereas pretreatment with rottlerin induced caspase-2 downregulation and inhibited PARP cleavage. Cisplatin-induced processing of caspase-3 was not inhibited by MG132 but was apparently
enhanced. The increase in caspase-3 processing by MG132 was
associated with an increase in proteolytic processing of PKCy
(Fig. 6B). Although pretreatment of cells with MG132 before
rottlerin treatment inhibited caspase-2 down-regulation, it failed to
enhance cisplatin-induced caspase activation or PARP cleavage
(Fig. 6A).
We also examined the effect of MG132 on caspase activity
using a fluorometric assay. Consistent with the Western blot
analysis (Fig. 6A), MG132 enhanced cisplatin-induced activation
of caspase-2, but rottlerin inhibited caspase-2 activation even
when cells were pretreated with MG132 (Fig. 6C). Thus, rottlerin
may also inhibit caspase-2 activation and processing.

Discussion
In the present study, we made a novel observation that rottlerin
induces down-regulation of caspase-2, and this may explain the
ability of rottlerin to protect against DNA damage–induced

apoptosis. Down-regulation of caspase-2 by rottlerin was triggered
by the proteasome-mediated pathway. Furthermore, the effect of
rottlerin on caspase-2 down-regulation was independent of its
ability to inhibit PKCy.
Rottlerin was originally identified as a specific inhibitor of PKCy
(37). Since the demonstration that PKCy is a substrate for caspase3, there have been numerous studies that used rottlerin to link
PKCy with DNA damage–induced apoptosis (39). We have
previously shown that rottlerin inhibited cisplatin-induced caspase
activation and cell death, suggesting that PKCy not only acts as a
substrate for caspase-3 but also regulates caspase activation (30).
Rottlerin not only inhibited activation of caspase-3 but it also
inhibited processing of caspase-9 (31). We proposed that rottlerin
acts at an early stage before caspase-9 activation to regulate
cisplatin-induced cell death (31).
Caspase-9 is believed to be the apical caspase during DNA
damage–induced apoptosis, although recent studies suggest that
caspase-2 may act upstream of caspase-9 (7, 13, 21, 24, 32, 33). Our
results show that knockdown of caspase-2 inhibited the processing
of caspase-9 and caspase-8. In contrast, knockdown of caspase-9
failed to inhibit processing of caspase-2 and caspase-8. These results
suggest that caspase-2 may indeed act upstream of caspase-9 during
cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Although rottlerin inhibited activation
and processing of apical caspase-8 and caspase-9, we made an
unexpected observation that rottlerin induced down-regulation of
caspase-2. Rottlerin, however, did not influence the levels of other
caspases, such as caspase-3, caspase-7, caspase-8, and caspase-9.
It is conceivable that down-regulation of caspase-2 by rottlerin may
inhibit activation and processing of caspase-9 and downstream
caspases.
Because PKCy plays an important role in DNA damage–induced
apoptosis, it is conceivable that rottlerin induces caspase-2 downregulation via PKCy-dependent pathway. However, several studies
reported that rottlerin acts on additional targets besides PKCy
(40–46). For example, rottlerin acts as a mitochondrial uncoupler
independent of its effects on PKCy (40, 43, 46). We therefore
compared the effects of rottlerin with other pharmacologic
inhibitors of PKC. Rottlerin inhibits PKC isozymes with IC50 values
for PKCy (3–6 Amol/L), cPKCs (30–40 Amol/L), and PKCq, PKCD, and
PKC~ (80–100 Amol/L; ref. 37). BIM inhibits all PKC isozymes with

rank order of potency a > hI > q > y > ~ (38). Although cPKCs are
inhibited at nanomolar concentrations, nPKCs are inhibited at
submicromolar concentrations. One of the caveats with the use of
these broad specificity PKC inhibitors is that they inhibit multiple
PKC isozymes, which may have opposite effects on apoptosis. For
example, we have shown that inhibition of PKCa by cPKC-specific
inhibitor Gö 6976 or knockdown of PKCa by siRNA enhanced
cisplatin-induced apoptosis (47). Thus, depending on the concentrations of these inhibitors, they may increase or decrease activation
of caspases and proteolytic cleavage of PKCy and PARP. We have
found that although 1 Amol/L BIM or Gö 6983 attenuated proteolytic

cleavage of PKCy, they did not induce caspase-2 down-regulation.
Furthermore, silencing of PKCy by siRNA failed to induce caspase-2
down-regulation. These results suggest that the effect of rottlerin on
caspase-2 down-regulation was PKCy independent.
PKCy may be activated by cofactors or by proteolytic activation.
During apoptosis, cleavage of PKCy at the hinge region by caspase-3
removes the autoinhibitory regulatory domain leading to its proteolytic activation (39). Because down-regulation of caspase-2
prevents activation of downstream caspases, including caspase-3,
it also decreases proteolytic activation of PKCy, which is cleaved
by caspase-3. To determine if inhibition of PKCy processing by

caspase-2 knockdown was responsible for the antiapoptotic effect
of rottlerin, we examined the effect of PKCy knockdown on caspase
activation and cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Silencing of PKCy had
modest effect on the processing of caspase-2 and caspase-9, and
cleavage of PARP in HeLa cells, but it had little effect on the
processing of caspases in 2008 cells (data not shown). Because
rottlerin effectively inhibited processing of these caspases in both
cell types, these results suggest that rottlerin acts on additional
targets besides PKCy.
To understand how rottlerin induces caspase-2 down-regulation,
we compared the effects of several protease inhibitors, including
calpain inhibitor calpeptin and proteasome inhibitors MG132 and
PSI. Only proteasome inhibitors were able to prevent rottlerinmediated down-regulation of caspase-2, suggesting that rottlerin
triggers caspase-2 down-regulation via proteasome-mediated pathway. Because MG132 prevents caspase-2 down-regulation by
rottlerin, we expected that pretreatment with MG132 would reverse
the protective effect of rottlerin on cisplatin-induced cell death.
However, MG132 had no effect on rottlerin-mediated protection
against cisplatin-induced cell death. One possibility is that caspase-2
is not important for cisplatin-induced cell death, and thus, inhibition
of caspase-2 down-regulation has no effect on cisplatin-induced cell
death. This is unlikely because knockdown of caspase-2 by siRNA
inhibited cisplatin-induced cell death. Rottlerin also prevented
activation of caspase-2 even when caspase-2 down-regulation was
prevented by MG132. Thus, rottlerin not only induces caspase-2
down-regulation but it also inhibits caspase-2 activity.
It has been shown that the proteolytic fragment of PKCy
generated by caspase-3–mediated cleavage is necessary for DNA
damage–induced apoptosis (26–29). It has also been reported that
PKCy is a substrate for caspase-2 because recombinant PKCy was
cleaved by recombinant caspase-2 in vitro (19). The authors
suggested that caspase-2 is primarily responsible for doxorubicininduced cleavage of PKCy because 5 Amol/L caspase-3 inhibitor
zDEVD partially blocked doxorubicin-induced PKCy cleavage,
whereas 10 Amol/L caspase-2 inhibitor zVDVAD completely
blocked it. Thus, inhibition of caspase-2 may inhibit proteolysis
of PKCy. We, however, failed to detect any cleavage of PKCy in

MCF-7 cells (48) that lack functional caspase-3 (49), although these
cells express caspase-2 (20). Furthermore, we have shown that
caspase-2 acts upstream of caspase-3. Thus, inhibition of caspase-2
by zVDVAD is expected to inhibit caspase-3 and, thus, cleavage of
PKCy. Regardless of whether PKCy is cleaved by caspase-3 or
caspase-2, rottlerin can still inhibit apoptosis by directly inhibiting
the catalytic fragment of PKCy generated by these caspases.
Consequently, even when caspase-2 down-regulation is inhibited by
proteasome inhibitors, rottlerin can still prevent cisplatin-induced
apoptosis. Thus, one possibility is that rottlerin not only acts
upstream of caspase-2 to regulate its level, but it also acts
downstream of caspase-2 and caspase-3 to directly inhibit PKCy
catalytic fragment.
There are, however, controversies whether rottlerin inhibits
PKCy or not. Gschwendt et al. (37) have shown that rottlerin
directly inhibits PKCy catalytic activity, whereas Davies et al. (50)
failed to show inhibition of PKCy activity by rottlerin in vitro. Our
results show that knockdown of PKCy, which inhibited cisplatininduced generation of PKCy catalytic fragment, had modest effect
on the processing of caspases, suggesting that rottlerin may act on
additional targets besides PKCy. Several studies have shown that
mitochondrial uncoupling effect of rottlerin could contribute to
apoptosis in a PKCy-independent manner (41, 46). These studies,
however, do not explain how rottlerin exerts its antiapoptotic
function during DNA damage–induced apoptosis. We have found
that rottlerin inhibited processing of caspase-2 as well as caspase-9,
caspase-3, and caspase-7 even when caspase-2 down-regulation
was inhibited by MG132, suggesting that rottlerin acts upstream of
caspase-9 in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor.
The mechanism of caspase-2 activation remains elusive.
Caspase-2 can function both as an apical as well as an effector
caspase. It has been reported that caspase-2 is processed by
caspase-3, and this processing could result in an amplification loop
(20). Because caspase-3 is a substrate for PKCy and phosphorylation of caspase-3 by PKCy results in its activation (51), inhibition of
PKCy by rottlerin may inhibit caspase-3 and further processing of
caspase-2. Blockage of caspase-2 processing may in turn result in

Down-regulation of Caspase-2 by Rottlerin

Figure 6. Effect of MG132 and rottlerin on caspase activation. A, HeLa cells were pretreated with or without MG132 for 30 min before treatment with rottlerin
for another 30 min. Cells were then treated with or without the indicated concentrations of cisplatin for 14 h. Cells were processed for Western blot analysis with the
indicated antibodies. Tubulin was used to control for loading differences. Arrows, processed forms of caspases and PARP. B, HeLa cells were treated with MG132,
rottlerin, and cisplatin as described above and processed for Western blot analysis. C, caspase-2 activity was determined using VDVAD-AFC as the substrate as
described under Materials and Methods. Columns, mean of four separate measurements; bars, SE.

feedback loop. Thus, proteolytic activation of PKCy may be
dependent on the generation of the processed form of caspase-2.
In summary, we have shown that caspase-2 functions as an
apical caspase during DNA damage–induced apoptosis, and
rottlerin acts upstream of caspase-2 via PKCy-independent
pathway. We made a novel observation that down-regulation of
caspase-2 by rottlerin rather than inhibition of PKCy activity can
explain the antiapoptotic function of rottlerin.
