Abstract
Although recent clinical trials of BRAF inhibitor combinations
have demonstrated improved efﬁcacy in BRAF-mutant colorectal
cancer, emergence of acquired resistance limits clinical beneﬁt.
Here, we undertook a comprehensive effort to deﬁne mechanisms
underlying drug resistance with the goal of guiding development
of therapeutic strategies to overcome this limitation. We generated
a broad panel of BRAF-mutant resistant cell line models across
seven different clinically relevant drug combinations. Combinatorial drug treatments were able to abrogate ERK1/2 phosphorylation in parental-sensitive cells, but not in their resistant counterparts, indicating that resistant cells escaped drug treatments
through one or more mechanisms leading to biochemical reactivation of the MAPK signaling pathway. Genotyping of resistant
cells identiﬁed gene ampliﬁcation of EGFR, KRAS, and mutant

BRAF, as well as acquired mutations in KRAS, EGFR, and MAP2K1.
These mechanisms were clinically relevant, as we identiﬁed emergence of a KRAS G12C mutation and increase of mutant BRAF
V600E allele frequency in the circulating tumor DNA of a patient
at relapse from combined treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors. To identify therapeutic combinations capable of overcoming
drug resistance, we performed a systematic assessment of candidate therapies across the panel of resistant cell lines. Independent
of the molecular alteration acquired upon drug pressure, most
resistant cells retained sensitivity to vertical MAPK pathway suppression when combinations of ERK, BRAF, and EGFR inhibitors
were applied. These therapeutic combinations represent promising strategies for future clinical trials in BRAF-mutant colorectal
cancer. Cancer Res; 76(15); 4504–15. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

melanomas and 5%–8% of colorectal cancers (1). The most
frequent BRAF mutation (V600E) affects the kinase domain,
mimics BRAF phosphorylated state, and leads to constitutive
activation of the protein (1). In colorectal cancer, BRAF mutations
are associated with hypermethylated tumor subtypes and are
linked with aggressive, less-differentiated, and therapy-resistant
disease (2). Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients with
BRAF V600E–mutant tumors show poor sensitivity to the EGFRtargeted mAbs panitumumab and cetuximab and display poor
prognosis with a median overall survival of only about 6 to 9
months (3).
BRAF V600E–mutant tumor types do not respond uniformly
to BRAF-targeted therapy (4). Targeted inhibitors of mutant
BRAF alone, or in combination with inhibitors of its downstream effector MEK, induce high response rates in BRAFmutant melanoma (5, 6); in contrast, a phase I study of mCRC
patients has shown that the BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) vemurafenib has no clinical beneﬁt when given as monotherapy (7).
The molecular basis of this discrepancy has been partly
explained by dissimilar EGFR expression levels between these
two malignancies. Intrinsic resistance of colorectal cancer cells
to BRAF or MEK-targeted agents is mediated by the release of
a feedback loop, which activates EGFR signaling, leading to

Activating mutations in the BRAF oncogene occur in approximately 7% of human malignancies, including 50%–60% of

Resistance to BRAF Combination Therapies in Colon Cancer

reactivation of MAPK signaling and often to upregulation of
parallel PI3K–AKT pathways, triggering proliferation and survival (8–10). Melanomas are sensitive to BRAFi as they originate from the neural crest and do not express EGFR, making
this feedback loop ineffective. On the other hand, colorectal
cancers arise from epithelial cells in which EGFR is generally
constitutively expressed.
These preclinical studies have provided the rationale for testing
dual/triple vertical blockade of the MAPK pathway by targeting
EGFR, BRAF, and MEK in BRAF-mutant mCRC patients. Combinations targeting EGFR, BRAF, and the prosurvival PI3K pathways
are also being explored. Clinical objective responses have been
seen in 20%–40% of patients treated with doublet or triplet
combinatorial regimens (11–13).
Nevertheless, preliminary clinical evidence from phase Ib trials
shows that responses are limited in duration (4, 11–16). The
molecular basis underlying intrinsic or acquired resistance to
these drug combinations in BRAF-mutant mCRC has not been
comprehensively deﬁned. The mechanisms by which cancer cells
evade targeted therapies are usually molecularly heterogeneous,
but they often converge downstream in the pathway, which was
originally blocked by the targeted agent. For instance, cell lines
and mCRC patients that become resistant to single-agent cetuximab or panitumumab show a variety of molecular mechanisms
that converge in reactivating the MAPK pathway, including mutations in the drug-binding sites of EGFR, RAS/RAF ampliﬁcation, or
mutations, or genetic alterations leading to activation of alternative receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) such as MET or HER2
(reviewed in ref. 17). Similarly, BRAF-mutant melanomas that
become refractory to BRAF and/or MEK inhibitors (MEKi) also
show a variety of molecular mechanisms leading to reactivation of
MAPK and/or AKT signaling. These include increased expression
of RTKs such as PDGFRb, IGF-1R, and EGFR; overexpression of the
COT kinase; mutation of MEK1 (MAP2K1) and MEK2 (MAP2K2)
kinase; MITF or NRAS mutations; ampliﬁcation, or alternative
splicing of the BRAF gene; CDKN2A loss; or genetic alterations in
the PI3K–PTEN–AKT pathway (reviewed in ref. 18).
On these premises, we hypothesized that heterogeneous genetic alterations leading to reactivation of the MAPK pathway could
be responsible for acquired resistance to regimens cotargeting
EGFR, BRAF, MEK, and PI3K in colorectal cancer patients, despite
vertical pathway suppression at multiple key nodes. To perform a
comprehensive assessment of the landscape of potential acquired
resistance mechanisms, we cultured BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer cell lines in the presence of seven distinct clinically relevant
combinatorial regimens until the emergence of resistant derivatives. These cell lines were subjected to genetic, biochemical, and
functional analyses to identify molecular alterations underlying
drug resistance. As in vitro modeling of acquired resistance in
cancer cell models has proven effective in identifying resistance
mechanisms that occur clinically (19–21), these ﬁndings may
predict those mechanisms of resistance likely to arise in patients.
These preclinical models also represent valuable tools for key
functional studies aimed at identifying effective strategies to
overcome drug resistance.

Materials and Methods
Generation of drug-resistant cell lines
WiDr parental cells were a gift from R. Bernards (The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) in July 2011.

www.aacrjournals.org

HROC87 parental cells were shared by M. Linnebacher (University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany) in September 2011. VACO432
parental cells were obtained from Horizon Discovery in March
2011. The genetic identity of parental cell lines and their resistant
derivatives was conﬁrmed by short tandem repeat proﬁling (Cell
ID System; Promega) not fewer than 2 months before drug
proﬁling experiments. BRAF-mutant HROC87, VACO432,
and WiDr cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes at a density of
5  106/plate and treated with drug combinations as indicated in
Supplementary Table S1. Additional information is provided in
Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Drug sensitivity assay
Cell proliferation and cytotoxicity were determined by cellular
ATP levels (CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Assay; Promega) and DNA
incorporation of a ﬂuorescent cyanine dye (CellTox Green; Promega) after 72-hours drug treatment, respectively. Additional
information is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods and Supplementary Table S2.
Western Blot analysis
Protein quantiﬁcation, SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and
chemiluminescent detection were performed as described previously (19). Detailed information is provided in Supplementary
Materials and Methods.
Gene copy number analysis qPCR
Cell line DNA (10 ng) was ampliﬁed by quantitative PCR using
the GoTaq QPCR Master Mix (Promega) with an ABI PRISM
7900HT apparatus (Applied Biosystems). HER2, MET, EGFR,
KRAS, and BRAF gene copy number was assessed as described
previously (19). Data were normalized to a control diploid cell
line, HCEC (22), and expressed as the ratio between resistant and
the corresponding parental cells. Primer sequences are reported in
Supplementary Table S3.
FISH
Dual color FISH analysis was performed using Chr7q
(7q11.21)/BRAF (7q34) probes, Chr7q/EGFR (7p12) probes,
Chr12q (12q12)/KRAS (12p12.1) probes (Abnova), and all
probe pairs were labeled with FITC and Texas Red, respectively.
Details are provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Candidate-gene mutational analysis
Cell line DNA was extracted by Wizard SV Genomic DNA
Puriﬁcation System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's
directions. The following genes and exons were analyzed by
automated Sanger sequencing by ABI PRISM 3730 (Applied
Biosystems): KRAS (exons 2, 3, and 4), NRAS (exons 2 and 3),
BRAF (exon 15), EGFR (exon 12), MAP2K1 (exons 2 and 3),
MAP2K2 (exon 2). Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary
Table S3.
Droplet digital PCR
Genomic DNA from colorectal cancer cells was ampliﬁed using
ddPCR Supermix for Probes (Bio-Rad) using BRAF V600E assay
(PrimePCR ddPCR Mutation Assay, Bio-Rad). Droplet digital PCR
(ddPCR) was then performed according to the manufacturer's
protocol and the results reported as percentage or fractional

abundance of mutant DNA alleles to total (mutant plus wildtype) DNA alleles, as described previously (23).
Viral infection
The lentivirus production, cell infection, and transduction
procedures were performed as described previously (24). WiDr
cells were transduced with a lenti-control vector or a lentiviral
vector carrying a mutated hBRAF V600E cDNA (a gift of Maria
S. Soengas, CNIO, Madrid, Spain) or EGFR WT cDNA (a gift
from Dr. C. Sun and Prof R. Bernards, The Netherlands Cancer
Institute, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). VACO432 cells were
transduced with a lentiviral vector carrying EGFR G465R–
mutant cDNA (25).
Clinical samples
A chemorefractory mCRC patient was enrolled in the
CMEK1622110 clinical trial (clinical trial registration ID:
NCT01543698) at Niguarda Cancer Center, Milan, Italy. The
patient was treated with the BRAFi encorafenib (LGX818) in
combination with the MEKi binimetinib (MEK162) from September 2013 to March 2014, obtaining a partial response in
January 2014, followed by radiologic progression in March
2014. Blood samples from this patient were obtained at baseline
(September 2013) and at progression (March 2014) through a
separate liquid biopsy research protocol approved by the Ethics
Committee at Ospedale Niguarda, Milan, Italy. The study was
conducted according to the provisions of the Declaration of
Helsinki, and the patient signed and provided informed consent
before sample collection.
Next-generation sequencing analysis
Germline DNA was obtained from PBMC (Promega, ReliaPrep
Tissue Kit), while cell free circulating DNA of tumor origin
(ctDNA) was extracted from 2-mL plasma using the QIAamp
Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Libraries were prepared with Nextera Rapid
Capture Custom Enrichment Kit (Illumina Inc.), according to the
manufacturer's protocol, as described previously (23). The custom-panel included the coding region of 226 genes, as detailed
previously (23). Further details are provided in Supplementary
Materials and Methods.
Bioinformatics analysis
NGS bioinformatics analysis was performed as described previously (23). Mutational analyses were the result of comparison
between pre- and post-treatment samples. Details are provided in
Supplementary Materials and Methods.

Results
Generation of models of acquired resistance to combinatorial
therapies targeting EGFR–BRAF–MEK–PI3K
We selected three BRAF V600E–mutant colorectal cancer
cell lines, HROC87, WiDr, and VACO432, which are resistant
to single-agent BRAFi or MEKi, but sensitive to combined
BRAFi/MEKi or their combinations with cetuximab (Supplementary Fig. S1). To gain a comprehensive understanding of
potential therapeutic resistance mechanisms in BRAF-mutant
colorectal cancer, cell lines were cultured until resistant derivatives emerged in the presence of seven different drug combinations currently being explored in clinical trials. The drugs

4506 Cancer Res; 76(15) August 1, 2016

included the BRAFi dabrafenib, encorafenib, and vemurafenib; the MEKi selumetinib and trametinib; the EGFR-targeted
antibody cetuximab; and the selective PI3K-a inhibitor
(PI3Ki) alpelisib (Fig. 1A). A total of eleven resistant cell line
models were generated. Two independent resistant cell populations were obtained by growing VACO432 cells with vemurafenib and cetuximab (VþC) and these were therefore indicated as resistant A (R.A) and resistant B (R.B). Resistance to
drug treatment was conﬁrmed by cell viability assay comparing parental and resistant cell derivatives. All resistant cell
models were clearly refractory at all drug concentrations tested
(Fig. 1B).
Cells with acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitor combinations
display biochemical reactivation of MAPK signaling
Prior studies indicate that tumors with acquired resistance
to BRAF or EGFR-targeted agents in monotherapy maintain
sustained levels of MEK/ERK or (occasionally) AKT phosphorylation even in the presence of drug (19, 26–29). We
tested whether the same biochemical rewiring could occur in
cells made resistant to combinations of therapies targeting
EGFR-BRAF-MEK-PI3K. Amounts of total MEK, ERK, or AKT
proteins were not substantially different between parental
cells and their resistant counterparts. However, variation of
their phosphorylation levels (pMEK, pERK, or pAKT) was
evident after drug treatment. Some, but not all, resistant
models displayed increased phosphorylation of AKT at
Ser473 upon drug treatment. However, every resistant model
showed sustained levels of ERK phosphorylation despite
drug treatment, in stark contrast to parental cells in which
robust inhibition of ERK phosphorylation was observed with
all treatments (Fig. 2).
Overall, these analyses indicate that combinatorial EGFRi/
BRAFi/MEKi/PI3Ki treatments abrogate ERK phosphorylation in
parental-sensitive cells, but that their resistant counterparts can
sustain MAPK signaling in the presence of these therapeutic
combinations (Fig. 2).
Acquired molecular alterations in BRAF-mutant colorectal
cancer cell lines confer resistance to BRAF inhibitor
combinations
To identify likely candidate drug resistance mechanisms leading to biochemical reactivation of MAPK signaling, we focused
our analysis on components of the MAPK pathway by performing
copy number analyses of HER2, EGFR, MET, KRAS and BRAF and
Sanger sequencing of the most pertinent exons of EGFR, KRAS,
NRAS, BRAF, MAP2K2, and MAP2K1.
Quantitative PCR on genomic DNA extracted from resistant
cells showed no changes in HER2 or MET gene copy number while
EGFR, KRAS, or BRAF gene copy number increased in three WiDr
derivatives resistant to VþS, DþC or SþC, respectively (Fig. 3A).
All gene ampliﬁcations were only found in the resistant cell
populations and were conﬁrmed by FISH analyses (Fig. 3B).
Sanger sequencing of hotspot regions of EGFR (exon 12), KRAS
(exons 2, 3, and 4), NRAS (exons 2 and 3), BRAF (exon 15),
MAP2K1 (exons 2 and 3), and MAP2K2 (exon 2) revealed
acquired gene mutations in eight cell lines, as summarized
in Table 1. All resistant cell populations retained the original
BRAF V600E mutation. All other mutations found in resistant cells
were not detected in their parental counterparts by conventional
Sanger sequencing.

exon 2 KRAS mutations in driving resistance to BRAFiþEGFRi
(30). Our data suggest that exon 4 KRAS mutations can also
promote resistance. In addition, KRAS ampliﬁcation was identiﬁed in WiDr resistant to BRAFiþEGFRi (DþC). KRAS ampliﬁcation was found in the post-treatment biopsy of a colorectal
cancer patient with acquired resistance to the combination of
encorafenib and cetuximab (30). These ﬁndings suggest that
the cell models generated in this work have the potential to
recapitulate clinically relevant resistance mechanisms.
Increased BRAF gene copy number was seen in WiDr resistant
to MEKiþEGFRi (SþC). Selective ampliﬁcation of mutant BRAF
V600E allele was previously identiﬁed in a BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer patient with acquired resistance to BRAFiþEGFRi
(30), in colorectal cancer cell lines with secondary resistance to
the MEKi selumetinib (31, 32), as well as in melanoma patients
upon progression on the BRAFi vemurafenib (33), but not yet
implicated in refractoriness to combined MEKiþEGFRi. To
assess whether BRAF gene ampliﬁcation had occurred in an
allele-selective manner, we performed digital PCR analyses.
WiDr parental cells carried 1 mutant and 3 wild-type alleles
of BRAF, while their SþC resistant derivatives displayed a 9:1
mutant/wild-type ratio (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Western blot
analysis with a diagnostic antibody speciﬁc for the V600E
variant showed that the mutant protein was selectively overexpressed (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Finally, we validated that
ectopic overexpression of mutant BRAF in WiDr parental cells
can confer resistance to combined MEKiþEGFRi (Supplementary Fig. S2C and S2D).

4508 Cancer Res; 76(15) August 1, 2016

Two different MAP2K1 mutations leading to the V211D and
L115P amino acid changes were identiﬁed in HROC87 and
VACO432 resistant to MEKiþEGFRi (SþC) and BRAFiþMEKi
(DþT), respectively. These mutations have previously been
reported to confer resistance to MEK allosteric inhibitors in
melanoma and colorectal cancer by preventing drug binding
(27, 34), so they were not subjected to further functional
validation.
Interestingly, ampliﬁcation of EGFR was found in WiDr
resistant to BRAFiþMEKi (VþS). Although EGFR signaling has
been implicated in intrinsic resistance to BRAFi monotherapy
in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer (8, 9), EGFR gene ampliﬁcation has not previously been established as a potential
resistance mechanism in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer. This
result is consistent with previous observations that induction
of EGFR protein expression can drive resistance to BRAFi or
MEKi in melanoma (35). Ectopic overexpression of EGFR in
WiDr parental cells was able to confer resistance to combined
BRAFiþMEKi or BRAFiþEGFRi (Fig. 4A and B). Importantly,
however, the triple combination of BRAFiþEGFRiþMEKi was
able to restore sensitivity in resistant cells carrying EGFR ampliﬁcation (Fig. 4C).
A single point mutation affecting the ectodomain of EGFR
(G465R) was found in VACO432 VþC (R.B). Although this
variant has previously been shown to disrupt receptor–antibody
interaction, leading to cetuximab or panitumumab resistance in
RAS/BRAF wild-type colorectal cancers (25), mutations affecting
the EGFR ectodomain have not been reported previously as

in disrupting anti-EGFR Ab binding, the ability of the EGFR
G465R mutation to promote resistance was speciﬁc to BRAFi þ
EGFRi combinations with anti-EGFR antibodies only, and kinase
inhibition of EGFR by geﬁtinib was able to restore sensitivity in
combination with BRAFi (Fig. 4F).

KRAS, and BRAF were labeled with Texas Red (red signal) and chromosome 7
(Chr7) and 12 (Chr12) with FITC (green signal). EGFR gene ampliﬁcation was
found extrachromosomally as double minutes, while a focal intrachromosomal
ampliﬁcation of KRAS and BRAF loci could be identiﬁed.

Clinical acquired resistance to combined therapy with BRAF
and MEK inhibitors
Identiﬁcation of clinical acquired resistance mechanisms to
targeted therapy combinations was performed by genotyping of
liquid biopsy samples. Plasma samples taken before treatment
and after disease progression were collected from a patient with
BRAF V600E–mutant colorectal cancer who had achieved a
partial response on a RAF/MEK inhibitor combination (clinical
trial registration ID: NCT01543698). ctDNA was extracted and
subjected to molecular proﬁling by NGS analysis of a custom
panel of 226 cancer-related genes (23). The analysis revealed
that the percentage of reads carrying TP53 p.R282W–mutated
allele were consistent between the baseline and the progression
plasma (Fig. 5), indicating similar ctDNA content in both
samples. In contrast, the proportion of BRAF V600E–mutant
reads at resistance was twice as much as those in the baseline,
suggesting selective ampliﬁcation of the BRAF-mutant allele.
NGS analysis revealed concomitantly the emergence of a KRAS
G12C allele, which was undetectable in the pretreatment sample. These results indicate that the mechanisms of resistance to
target inhibitors identiﬁed in cell lines could faithfully recapitulate those found in clinical samples.
Overall, we observed that a diverse array of molecular mechanisms can drive acquired resistance to clinically relevant therapeutic
combinations targeting the EGFR–BRAF–MEK–PI3K pathways in
BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer. However, we also found that each
of these heterogeneous resistance mechanisms converges on a
common signaling output to promote resistance reactivation of
MAPK signaling, suggesting that it may be possible to devise a
universal targeted combination strategy capable of overcoming
multiple resistance mechanisms.

potential resistance mechanisms in the context of BRAF-mutant
tumors. To investigate the role of this mutation, we induced
ectopic expression of EGFR G465R in VACO432 parental cells.
Analysis of transduced cells indicated that the EGFR G465R
mutation is able to sustain ERK phosphorylation and cell proliferation in the presence of combined VþC treatment (Fig. 4D

Vertical combined suppression of the MAPK pathway has

On the basis of our observations that all resistant cell models
show persistent MAPK signaling activation (Fig. 2), we postulated
that they could retain sensitivity to suppression of the pathway
downstream. In this regard, previous data indicate that some
melanomas with acquired resistance to BRAFi monotherapy can

MEKi blockade (36). In addition, vertical triple blockade of EGFR
þ BRAF þ MEK displayed the highest ability to suppress ERK
phosphorylation in BRAF V600E colorectal cancer cells (37) and
this combination has been shown to induce response rates of up
to 40% in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer patients (11). Similarly,
previously published reports have documented promising preclinical activity of ERK inhibition in BRAFi or MEKi-resistant
melanoma models (27, 38, 39) as well as in MEKi þ BRAFi or
BRAFi þ EGFRi–resistant BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer cells
(30). However, it has not yet been established whether ERK
inhibitors might exhibit improved ability to overcome resistance
when given as monotherapy, or in combination with BRAFi
and/or EGFRi. Accordingly, we hypothesized that acquired resistance to BRAFi combinations could be overcome by more pro-

found MAPK pathway suppression achieved by triplet combinations or by the incorporation of ERK inhibitor–based combinations. To test these hypotheses, the effect on viability was systematically tested across all resistant cell line models for all drug
combinations used to generate resistant derivatives, as well
as combinations incorporating the ERK inhibitor (ERKi)

As expected, parental cell lines were highly sensitive to all drug

selection protocol. This suggests that resistance mechanisms
emerging under the selective pressure of these speciﬁc drug
combinations are capable of conferring resistance to that class
of inhibitors, and are unlikely to be related to any unique
properties of the speciﬁc drugs used.
Interestingly, the addition of PI3Ki to BRAFi þ EGFRi treatment
did not robustly affect viability in any of the resistant cells relative
to BRAFi þ EGFRi alone. This ﬁnding is consistent with initial
results of a clinical trial comparing encorafenib and cetuximab to
encorafenib, cetuximab, and alpelisib, which have not demonstrated a clear beneﬁt in response rate or progression-free survival
with the addition of the PI3K inhibitor alpelisib (12, 40). In
marked contrast, the triple combination of BRAFi þ EGFRi þ
MEKi showed improved efﬁcacy in many models relative to either
BRAFi þ EGFRi, BRAFi þ MEKi, or MEKi þ EGFRi alone. Finally,
the addition of BRAFi and/or EGFRi to ERKi appeared to improve
efﬁcacy in some resistant models relative to ERKi alone, suggesting
that ERKi may best be administered as part of therapeutic combinations in future clinical trials for BRAF-mutant colorectal
cancer. Indeed, analysis of resistant cell lines indicated that ERK
inhibition could induce cytotoxicity, which was further enhanced
when combined with BRAFi and/or EGFRi (Supplementary Fig.
S3A and S3B).

Discussion
Over the past few years, BRAF inhibitors have demonstrated
striking clinical efﬁcacy in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma.
However, BRAF inhibitors are not equally effective in other BRAFmutant cancer histologies (4). Preclinical studies deﬁning EGFR
and MAPK pathway reactivation as key drivers of BRAFi resistance
in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer have provided the rationale for
testing double or triple combinations of therapies targeting EGFR/
BRAF/MEK/PI3K in this disease (11–13, 15, 16).
Unfortunately, while these approaches have led to improvements in response rate in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer patients,
preliminary clinical observations have indicated that, following
an initial response, acquired resistance in BRAF-mutant colorectal
cancer patients typically emerges after a few months of treatment

www.aacrjournals.org

(11–13, 15). The mechanisms underlying acquired resistance in
BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer cells remain poorly characterized.
In this study, we undertook a comprehensive effort to develop
models of secondary resistance to a spectrum of seven clinically
relevant combinatorial therapies to more robustly deﬁne the
landscape of molecular mechanisms leading to acquired resistance in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer. Our results indicate that
the mechanisms leading to acquired resistance to these combinations can be genetically heterogeneous, but appear to converge on
the reactivation of the MAPK signaling pathway at the biochemical level, suggesting that it might be possible to develop universal
combination strategies capable of overcoming multiple resistance
mechanisms. We acknowledge that no in vivo models were generated or assessed in this study, thus limiting our observations to
cancer cell–autonomous drug resistance mechanisms. However,
analyses of plasma samples at baseline and at acquired resistance
to BRAF combinatorial therapy, in a BRAF-mutant colorectal
cancer patient, revealed genetic alterations consistent with those
identiﬁed in cell models, thus underscoring the clinical relevance
of the broad panel of resistant lines generated in this work. As
microenvironment and nongenomic mechanisms of drug resistance may also occur, future studies based on the analysis of BRAFmutant murine models and patient samples will be needed to
expand our knowledge on this aspect.
In our resistant cell line panel, we identiﬁed several novel
mechanisms of acquired resistance not previously reported in
BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer. In particular, we identiﬁed an
EGFR G465R ectodomain mutation in a cell line with acquired
resistance to the combination of a BRAFi and anti-EGFR antibody.
While this mutation has been established as a mechanism of
acquired resistance to anti-EGFR antibody monotherapy in RAS/
BRAF wild-type colorectal cancer due to disruption of antibody
binding (25), this class of mutations has not previously been
implicated in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer. Our observation
warrants assessing for EGFR ectodomain mutations in BRAFmutant colorectal cancer patients upon acquired resistance to
BRAFi and anti-EGFR antibody combinations. Importantly, we
found that a resistant model harboring this mutation retained
sensitivity to BRAFi and an EGFR kinase inhibitor, as well as to
downstream inhibitor combinations, such as BRAFi þ MEKi. We
also identiﬁed EGFR ampliﬁcation as a novel potential mechanism of acquired resistance in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer.
Interestingly, unlike the EGFR ectodomain mutation, EGFR
ampliﬁcation conferred cross-resistance to BRAFi þ EGFRi, BRAFi
þ MEKi, and MEKi þ EGFRi combinations, likely as a consequence of increased EGFR signaling ﬂux, and retained sensitivity
only to the triple combinations of BRAFi þ EGFRi þ MEKi and
ERKi þ BRAFi þ EGFRi. The ﬁnding that EGFR signaling leads to
MAPK feedback reactivation and resistance during BRAFi monotherapy, but also can contribute to acquired resistance to MAPK
combinatorial inhibition, highlights the central role of EGFR in
the biology of BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer.
Molecular analyses of our resistance cell line panel also identiﬁed the presence of several resistance mechanisms previously
identiﬁed in the setting of acquired resistance in BRAF-mutant
colorectal cancer, including KRAS mutation or ampliﬁcation,
BRAF V600E ampliﬁcation, and MAP2K1 mutation (30), thereby
underscoring the likely importance of these speciﬁc mechanisms
within the spectrum of acquired resistance in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer and supporting the likelihood that these speciﬁc
alterations may be frequently observed in patients. This is also

anti-EGFR therapies underpin a central role for KRAS in this
disease. Analysis by standard sensitivity sequencing has typically
identiﬁed KRAS and BRAF mutations in a mutually exclusive
fashion in colorectal cancer (41–43). To explain these observations, it has been suggested that concomitant oncogenic activation of KRAS and BRAF would be counter-selected during tumorigenesis, as it would result in activation of cell-cycle–inhibitory

Resistance to BRAF Combination Therapies in Colon Cancer

proteins of the Ink4/Arf locus, leading to oncogenic stress and
senescence (44). Nevertheless, the use of more sensitive techniques, such as droplet digital PCR, has recently revealed that lowallele frequency KRAS mutations could coexist with BRAF V600E
in colorectal cancer samples (7). These rare subclones may be
present but might possess an unfavorable ﬁtness compared to
clones with only mutant BRAF. However, the selective pressure of
BRAF-directed therapy may improve the proliferation rate of the
double mutant clones while reducing the viability of cells bearing
only mutant BRAF, thus driving outgrowth of resistant BRAF/
KRAS double mutant clones. Indeed, a recent study analyzing
tumor biopsies from BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer patients
obtained prior to BRAF-directed therapy revealed that more than
50% bear low-frequency KRAS mutations (7). This ﬁnding might
be explained by the "Big Bang" model (45), whereby tumors grow
predominantly as a single expansion producing numerous intermixed subclones, where the timing of an alteration rather than
clonal selection for that alteration is the primary determinant of
its pervasiveness. Similarly, it is possible that some of the other
common acquired resistance mechanisms we have observed in
BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer, such as BRAF V600E ampliﬁcation and MAP2K1 mutation, may also pre-exist in rare tumor
subclones. Indeed, we previously found that rare tumor cells with
BRAF ampliﬁcation could be identiﬁed in pretreatment tumor
biopsies from BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer patients (32). Altogether, these observations suggest that KRAS as well as other
resistance alterations could develop at an early stage of BRAFmutant colorectal tumorigenesis, thus laying the seeds for the
eventual emergence of acquired resistance. In a resistant cell
model and in our patient, BRAF combinatorial therapies have
resulted in the appearance of at least two concomitant resistance
mechanisms. Indeed, the lower percentage of KRAS-mutant allele
in comparison with the TP53 founder mutation suggested that
this variant may have been present in only a fraction of tumor cells
distinct from the BRAF V600E–ampliﬁed subset. These data are
consistent with previous reports in melanomas resistant to BRAFi,
either as monotherapy or in combination with MEKi, in which
multiple resistance mechanisms have been described to cooccur
in individual patients (46, 47).
The observation that all resistance mechanisms identiﬁed in
our cell panel converge to reactivate MAPK signaling has important clinical implications. As it may not be practical to design
speciﬁc therapeutic strategies against each of the individual
acquired resistance mechanisms observed in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer, there would be clear clinical advantages to developing a more "universal" therapeutic strategy targeting a common
signaling output that would be capable of overcoming a spectrum
of potential resistance mechanisms. By systematically comparing
multiple drug combinations designed to achieve more optimal
MAPK pathway suppression across the molecular landscape of
acquired resistance mechanisms in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer, we were able to identify the most promising therapeutic
candidates to overcome resistance. Although a few resistant cell
lines showed only modest sensitivity to these combinations,
suggesting the possibility that these models might harbor additional MAPK-independent resistance mechanisms, overall we
observed that the combination of BRAFi þ EGFRi þ MEKi or
ERKi in combination with BRAFi and/or EGFRi displayed superior
activity across the vast majority of resistant models. Therefore,
these combinations may represent the most promising strategies
for evaluation in clinical trials for patients with BRAF-mutant

www.aacrjournals.org

colorectal cancer. Notably, the triple combination of BRAFi þ
EGFRi þ MEKi is currently being evaluated in clinical trials, and
preliminary results suggest improved response rate and progression-free survival compared with the individual doublet combinations (48), which is consistent with our ﬁndings, and suggests
that improved activity against the common resistance mechanisms in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer may account in part for the
improved clinical efﬁcacy observed.
Consistent with our ﬁndings, previously published reports
have documented promising preclinical activity of ERK inhibition
in BRAFi- or MEKi-resistant cell line models (27, 38, 39) and in
MEKi þ BRAFi and BRAFi þ EGFRi–resistant BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer cells (30), supporting ERKi as key potential components of future clinical trial strategies for this disease. While it is
likely that secondary mutations in ERK1/2 may limit the longterm efﬁcacy of ERKi (49), it remains an important and unanswered question as to whether it is best to administer ERKi as
monotherapy or whether ERKi might be more effective as part of
drug combinations in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer. Indeed, it is
possible that ERK inhibition alone might trigger survival-promoting feedback loops through alternative pathways that might be
optimally suppressed with therapeutic combinations. To help
guide future clinical trial strategies, our study begins to address
this critical question, and suggests that ERKi appears to be more
effective against the spectrum of acquired resistance mutations in
BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer when administered in combination with BRAFi and/or EGFRi inhibitors. In fact, the triplet
combination of ERKi þ BRAFi þ EGFRi appeared to be the most
effective combination strategy overall across our panel of resistant
cell line models. Thus, our study suggests that initial clinical trials
of ERKi in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer patients should prioritize therapeutic combinations with BRAFi and EGFR inhibitors.
