Author Manuscript

The systematic translation of cancer genomic data into knowledge of tumor biology and
therapeutic avenues remains challenging. Such efforts should be greatly aided by robust
preclinical model systems that reflect the genomic diversity of human cancers and for which
detailed genetic and pharmacologic annotation is available1. Here we describe the Cancer Cell
Line Encyclopedia (CCLE): a compilation of gene expression, chromosomal copy number, and
massively parallel sequencing data from 947 human cancer cell lines. When coupled with
pharmacologic profiles for 24 anticancer drugs across 479 of the lines, this collection allowed
identification of genetic, lineage, and gene expression-based predictors of drug sensitivity. In
addition to known predictors, we found that plasma cell lineage correlated with sensitivity to IGF1
receptor inhibitors; AHR expression was associated with MEK inhibitor efficacy in NRAS-mutant
lines; and SLFN11 expression predicted sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitors. Altogether, our
results suggest that large, annotated cell line collections may help to enable preclinical
stratification schemata for anticancer agents. The generation of genetic predictions of drug
response in the preclinical setting and their incorporation into cancer clinical trial design could
speed the emergence of “personalized” therapeutic regimens2.

Human cancer cell lines represent a mainstay of tumor biology and drug discovery through
facile experimental manipulation, global and detailed mechanistic studies, and various highthroughput applications. Numerous studies have employed cell line panels annotated with
both genetic and pharmacologic data, either within a tumor lineage3–5 or across multiple
cancer types6–12. While affirming the promise of systematic cell line studies, many prior
efforts were limited in their depth of genetic characterization and pharmacologic
interrogation.

Author Manuscript

To address these challenges, we generated a large-scale genomic dataset for 947 human
cancer cell lines, together with pharmacologic profiling of 24 compounds across ~500 of
these lines. The resulting collection, which we termed the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia
(CCLE), encompasses 36 tumor types (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table 1 and
www.broadinstitute.org/ccle). All cell lines were characterized by several genomic
technology platforms. The mutational status of >1,600 genes was determined by targeted
massively parallel sequencing, followed by removal of variants likely to be germline events
(Supplementary Methods). Moreover, 392 recurrent mutations affecting 33 known cancer
genes were assessed by mass spectrometric genotyping13 (Supplementary Table 2 and
Supplementary Fig. 1). DNA copy number was measured using high-density single
nucleotide polymorphism arrays (Affymetrix SNP 6.0; Supplementary Methods). Finally,
mRNA expression levels were obtained for each of the lines using Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0
arrays. These data were also used to confirm cell line identities (Supplementary Methods,
Supplementary Figs. 2–4).

Author Manuscript

We next measured the genomic similarities by lineage between CCLE lines and primary
tumors from Tumorscape14, expO, MILE and COSMIC datasets (Fig. 1b–d, see
Supplementary Methods). For most lineages, a strong positive correlation was observed in
both chromosomal copy number and gene expression patterns (median correlation
coefficients of 0.77, range = 0.52–0.94, p < 10−15, for copy number and 0.60, range = 0.29–
0.77, p < 10−15, for expression, respectively; Fig. 1b–c, Supplementary Table 3 and 4), as
has been described previously3–5,15. A positive correlation was also observed for point
mutation frequencies (median correlation coefficient = 0.71, range = −0.06–0.97, p < 10−2
for all but 3 lineages, Supplementary Fig. 5), even when TP53 was removed from the dataset
(median correlation coefficient = 0.64, range = −0.31–0.97, p < 10−2 for all but 3 lineages;
Fig. 1d, Supplementary Table 5). Thus, with relatively few exceptions (Supplementary
Information), the CCLE may provide representative genetic proxies for primary tumors in
many cancer types.

Given the pressing clinical need for robust molecular correlates of anticancer drug response,
we incorporated a systematic framework to ascertain molecular correlates of pharmacologic
sensitivity in vitro. First, 8-point dose response curves for 24 compounds (targeted and
cytotoxic agents) across 481 cell lines were generated (Supplementary Tables 1 and 6, and
Supplementary Methods). These curves were represented by a logistic sigmoidal function
with a maximal effect level (Amax), the concentration at half- maximal activity of the
compound (EC50), a Hill coefficient representing the sigmoidal transition, and the
concentration at which the drug response reached an absolute inhibition of 50% (IC50).

Broadly active compounds, exemplified by the HDAC inhibitor panobinostat, showed a
roughly even distribution of Amax and EC50 values across most cell lines (Fig. 2a). In
contrast, the RAF inhibitor PLX4720 displayed a more selective profile: Amax or EC50
values for most cell lines could be categorized as “sensitive” or “insensitive” to PLX4720,
with sensitive lines enriched for the BRAFV600E mutation (Fig. 2a). To capture
simultaneously the efficacy and potency of a drug, we designated an “activity area” (Fig. 2b
and Supplementary Fig. 6). The 24 compounds profiled showed wide variations in activity
area, and those with similar mechanisms of action clustered together (Supplementary Fig. 7).

Author Manuscript

Genomic correlates of drug sensitivity may be extracted by predictive models using machine
learning techniques6,10. We therefore assembled all CCLE genomic data types into a matrix
wherein each feature was converted to a z-score across all lines (Supplementary Methods).
Next, we adapted a categorical modeling approach that utilized a naive Bayes classification
and discrete sensitivity calls, or an elastic net regression analysis16 for continuous sensitivity
measurements. Both approaches were applied to all compounds with or without gene
expression data (Supplementary Methods). Prediction performance was determined using
ten-fold cross-validation, and the elastic net features were bootstrapped to retain only those
that were consistent across runs (Supplementary Methods).

Author Manuscript

Out of >50,000 input features, the regression-based analysis identified multiple known
features as top predictors of sensitivity to several agents (Supplementary Table 7 and
Supplementary Fig. 8 and 9), with robust cross-validated performance (Supplementary Fig.
10 and 11). For example, activating mutations in BRAF and NRAS were among the top four
predictors of sensitivity in models generated for the MEK inhibitor PD-032590110 (Fig. 2c).
Additional predictive features for MEK inhibition included expression of PTEN, PTPN5,
and SPRY2, which encodes a regulator of MAPK output. KRAS mutations were also
identified, albeit with a lower predictive value (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Tables 8–9 and
Supplementary Fig. 8).

Author Manuscript

Additional top predictors included EGFR mutations and ERBB2 amplification/overexpression for Erlotinib8 and Lapatinib17, respectively; BRAFV600E for RAF inhibitors
(PLX472018 and RAF265); HGF expression and MET amplification for the MET/ALK
inhibitor PF-234106619; and MDM2 over-expression for Nutlin-320 sensitivity. Variants
affecting the EXT2 gene, which encodes a glycosyltransferase involved in heparin sulfate
biosynthesis, were significantly correlated with Erlotinib sensitivity (Supplementary Fig.
12). This observation is intriguing in light of a report linking heparin sulfate with erlotinib
sensitivity21. In addition, NQO1 expression was identified as the top predictive feature for
sensitivity to the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG, a quinone moiety metabolized by
NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1). NQO1 produces a high-potency intermediate
(17-AAGH2)22, and has previously been identified as a potential biomarker for Hsp90
inhibitors23.
Since some genetic/molecular alterations occur commonly in specific tumor types, lineage
may become a confounding factor in predictive analyses. Indeed, a classifier built using the
entire cell line dataset performed suboptimally when applied exclusively to melanoma
derived-cell lines (Fig. 2d), whereas a model built with only melanoma cell lines performed

better (Fig. 2d). Predictive features in the melanoma-only model showed a strong overexpression of genes regulated by the transcription factors MITF and SOX10 (Supplementary
Table 10), recently identified as predictive of RAF inhibitor drug sensitivity within a
melanoma-dominated cell line collection.

Author Manuscript

On the other hand, lineage emerged as the predominant predictive feature for several
compounds. For example, elastic net studies of the HDAC inhibitor LBH589 (panobinostat)
identified hematologic lineages as predictors of sensitivity (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig.
9). Interestingly, most clinical responses to panobinostat and related compounds (e.g.,
vorinostat and romidepsin) have been observed in hematological cancers. Similarly, most
multiple myeloma cell lines (12 of 14 lines tested) exhibited enhanced sensitivity to the
IGF-1 receptor inhibitor AEW541 (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Fig. 8 and 9) and showed
high IGF1 expression (Fig. 2f). Interestingly, elevated IGF1R expression also correlated
with AEW541 sensitivity (Supplementary Fig. 9). The CCLE results suggest that multiple
myeloma may be a promising indication for clinical trials of IGF-1 receptor inhibitors24 and
that these drugs may have enhanced efficacy in cancers with high IGF1 or IGF1R
expression.

Author Manuscript

While BRAF and NRAS mutations are known single-gene predictors of sensitivity to MEK
inhibitors, several “sensitive” cell lines lacked mutations in these genes, whereas other lines
harboring these mutations were nonetheless “insensitive” (Fig. 2c). The elastic net
regression model derived from the subset of cell lines with validated NRAS mutations
identified elevated expression of the AHR gene (which encodes the aryl hydrocarbon
receptor) as strongly correlated with sensitivity to the MEK inhibitor PD-0325901 (Fig. 3a).
This finding was intriguing in light of prior studies suggesting that a related MEK inhibitor
(PD-98059) may also function as a direct AHR antagonist25. We therefore hypothesized that
the enhanced sensitivity of some NRAS-mutant cell lines to MEK inhibitors might relate to a
coexistent dependence on AHR function.

Author Manuscript

To test this hypothesis, we first confirmed the correlation between AHR expression and
sensitivity to MEK inhibitors in a subset of NRAS-mutant cell lines (Fig. 3b and
Supplementary Fig. 13). Next, we performed shRNA knockdown of AHR in cell lines with
high or low AHR expression (Fig. 3c). Silencing of AHR suppressed the growth of three
NRAS-mutant cell lines with elevated AHR expression (Figs. 3d–f), but had no effect on the
growth of two lines with low AHR expression (Figs. 3g–h). The growth inhibitory effect was
confirmed with two additional shRNAs, where evidence for a dose-dependent knockdown
effect was also apparent (Figs. 3i–j). We also tested the hypothesis that allosteric MEK
inhibitors may function as AHR antagonists by measuring the effect of PD-0325901 and
PD-98059 on endogenous CYP1A1 mRNA, a transcriptional target of AHR in some
contexts. Both compounds reduced CYP1A1 levels in NRAS-mutant melanoma cells
(IPC-298 and SK-MEL-2; Fig. 3k) but not in neuroblastoma cells (CHP-212, Fig. 3k),
suggesting that other factors may govern CYP1A1 expression in the latter lineage. Together,
these results suggest that AHR dependency may co-occur with MAP kinase activation in
some NRAS-mutant cancer cells, and that elevated AHR may serve as a mechanistic
biomarker for enhanced MEK inhibitor sensitivity in this setting.

We also looked for markers predictive of response to several conventional chemotherapeutic
agents (Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 6) and identified SLFN11
expression as the top correlate of sensitivity to irinotecan (Fig. 4a), a camptothecin analog
that inhibits the topoisomerase I (TOP1) enzyme. SLFN11 expression also emerged as the
top predictor of topotecan sensitivity (another TOP1 inhibitor; Supplementary Figs. 8 and
14). Overall, 12 of 16 lineages showed significant SLFN11 associations for topotecan or
irinotecan sensitivity (Pearson’s r ≥ 0.2, Supplementary Fig. 14b). This finding was
independently validated using data from the NCI-60 collection (Supplementary Fig. 15).
SLFN11 knockdown did not affect steady-state growth sensitivity profiles (Supplementary
Fig. 14d–f).

Author Manuscript

All three Ewing’s sarcoma cell lines screened showed both high SLFN11 expression and
sensitivity to irinotecan (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 14). Ewing’s sarcomas also exhibited
the highest SLFN11 expression among 4,103 primary tumor samples spanning 39 lineages
(Fig. 4c), suggesting that TOP1 inhibitors might offer an effective treatment option for this
cancer type. Toward this end, several ongoing trials in Ewing’s sarcoma are examining
irinotecan-based combinations, or the addition of topotecan to standard regimens26. For
some lineages with high SLFN11 expression, (e.g. cervical adenocarcinoma) topoisomerase
inhibitors already comprise a standard chemotherapy regimen. In other tumors where
topoisomerase inhibitors are commonly used (e.g., colorectal and ovarian cancers), a range
of SLFN11 expression was observed, raising the possibility that high SLFN11 expression
might enrich for tumors more likely to respond. If confirmed in correlative clinical studies,
SLFN11 expression may offer a means to stratify patients for topoisomerase inhibitor
treatment.

Author Manuscript

By assembling the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), we have expanded the process
of detailed annotation of preclinical human cancer models (www.broadinstitute.org/ccle).
Genomic predictors of drug sensitivity revealed both known and novel candidate biomarkers
of response. Even within genetically defined sub-populations—or when agents were broadly
active without clear genetic targets—predictive modeling studies identified key predictors or
mechanistic effectors of drug response. Future efforts that increase the scale and add
additional types of information (e.g., whole genome/transcriptome sequencing, epigenetic
studies, metabolic profiling or proteomic/phosphoproteomic analysis) should enable
additional insights. In the future, comprehensive and tractable cell line systems provided
through this and other efforts27 may facilitate numerous advances in cancer biology and
drug discovery.

Methods Summary
A total of 947 independent cancer cell lines were profiled at the genomic level (data
available at www.broadinstitute.org/ccle and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) using
accession numbers GSE36139) and compound sensitivity data was obtained for 479 lines
(Supplementary Table 11). Mutation information was obtained both by using massively
parallel sequencing of >1,600 genes (Supplementary Table 12) and by mass spectrometric
genotyping (OncoMap), which interrogated 492 mutations in 33 known oncogenes and
tumor suppressors. Genotyping/copy number analysis was performed using Affymetrix

Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 and expression analysis using the GeneChip Human
Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. 8-point dose response curves were generated for 24
anticancer drugs using an automated compound-screening platform. Compound sensitivity
data were used for two types of predictive models that utilized the naive Bayes classifier or
the elastic net regression algorithm. The effects of AHR expression silencing on cell viability
were assessed by stable expression of shRNA lentiviral vectors targeting either this gene or
luciferase as control. The effect of compound treatment on AHR target gene expression was
assessed by quantitative RT-PCR. A full description of the Methods is included in the

a. Distribution of cancer types in the CCLE by lineage. b. Comparison of DNA copynumber profiles (GISTIC G-scores) between cell lines and primary tumors. The diagonal of
the heatmap shows the Pearson correlation between corresponding sample types. Because
cell lines and tumors are separate datasets, the correlation matrix is asymmetric: the top left
showing how well the tumor features correlate with the average of the cell lines in a lineage,
and the bottom right showing the converse. c. Comparison of mRNA expression profiles
between cell lines and primary tumors. For each tumor type, the log-fold-change of the
5,000 most variable genes is calculated between that tumor type and all others. Pearson
correlations between tumor type fold-changes from primary tumors and cell lines are shown
as a heatmap. d. Comparison of point mutation frequencies between cell lines and primary
tumors in COSMIC (v56), restricted to genes that are well represented in both sample sets
but excluding TP53 which is highly prevalent in most tumor types. Pairwise Pearson
correlations are shown as a heatmap. *The correlations of esophageal, liver, and head and
neck cancer mutation frequencies are restored when including TP53.

Figure 2. Predictive modeling of pharmacologic sensitivity using CCLE genomic data

Author Manuscript

a. Drug responses for Panobinostat (green) and PLX4720 (orange/purple) represented by the
high-concentration effect level (Amax) and transitional concentration (EC50) for a sigmoidal
fit to the response curve (b). c. Elastic net regression modeling of genomic features that
predict sensitivity to PD-0325901. The bottom curve indicates drug response, measured as
the area over the dose-response curve (activity area), for each cell line. The central heatmap
shows the CCLE features in the model (continuous z-score for expression and copy-number,
dark red for discrete mutation calls), across all cell lines (x-axis). Bar plot (left): weight of
the top predictive features for sensitivity (bottom) or insensitivity (top). Parenthesis indicate
features present in >80% of models after bootstrapping. d. Specificity and sensitivity (ROC
curves) of cross-validated categorical models predicting the response to a MEK inhibitor,
PD-0325901 (activity area). Mean true positive rate and standard deviation (n=5) are shown
when models are built using all lines (“Global categorical model” in blue and orange), or
within only melanoma lines (green). e. Activity area values for LBH589 (panobinostat)
between cell lines derived from hematopoietic (n=61) and solid tumors (n=387). The middle
bar = median, box = inter-quartile range, and bars extend to 1.5x the inter-quartile range. f.
Distribution of activity area values for AEW541 relative to IGF1 mRNA expression. Orange
dots: multiple myeloma cell lines (n=14); blue dots: cell lines from other tumor types
(n=434). Box-and-whisker plots show the activity area or mRNA expression distributions

Figure 3. AHR expression may denote a tumor dependency targeted by MEK inhibitors in
NRAS-mutant cell lines

Author Manuscript

a. Predictive features for PD-0325901 sensitivity (varying baseline activity area) in
validated NRAS-mutant cell lines. b. Growth inhibition curves for NRAS-mutant cell lines
expressing high (red) or low (blue) levels of AHR mRNA in the presence of the MEK
inhibitor PD-0325901. c. Relative AHR mRNA expression across a panel of NRAS-mutant
cell lines (arrows indicate cell lines where AHR dependency was analyzed). d–h.
Proliferation of NRAS-mutant cell lines displaying high (d–f) and low (g–h) AHR mRNA
expression, after introduction of shRNAs against AHR (red lines) or luciferase (blue lines).
i. (left) Proliferation of IPC-298 cells (high AHR) after introduction of additional shRNAs
against AHR (shAHR_1 and shAHR_4; green and purple lines, respectively) or luciferase
(control shLuc; blue line); (right) corresponding immunoblot analysis of AHR protein. j.
Equivalent studies as in (i) with using SK-MEL-2 cells (high AHR). k. Endogenous
CYP1A1 mRNA expression in the neuroblastoma line CHP-212 or the melanoma lines
IPC-298 and SK-MEL-2 after exposure to vehicle (blue) or MEK inhibitors (PD-0325901,
green or PD-98059, purple). Error bars: standard deviation between replicates, with n=12
(b), n=3 (c), n=6 (d–k).

Figure 4. Predicting sensitivity to topoisomerase I inhibitors

Author Manuscript

a. Elastic net regression analysis of genomic correlates of irinotecan sensitivity is shown for
250 cell lines. b. Dose-response curves for three Ewing’s sarcoma cell lines (MSS-ES-1,
SK-ES-1, and TC-71) and two control cell lines with low SLFN11 expression (HCC-56, and
SK-HEP-1). Grey vertical bars: standard deviation of the mean growth inhibition (n=2). c.
SLFN11 expression across 4103 primary tumors. Box-and-whisker plots show the
distribution of mRNA expression for each subtype, ordered by the median SLFN11
expression level (line), the inter-quartile range (box) and up to 1.5x the inter-quartile range
(bars). Sample numbers (n) are indicated in parentheses.
