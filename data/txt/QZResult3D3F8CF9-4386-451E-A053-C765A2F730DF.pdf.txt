ABSTRACT
Cancer dormancy is a stage in tumor progression in which residual disease
remains occult and asymptomatic for a prolonged period. Cancer cell dormancy is the
main cause of cancer recurrence and failure of therapy. However, cancer dormancy is
poorly characterized and the mechanisms of how cancer cells develop dormancy and
relapse remain elusive. In this study, 5- fluorouracil (5-FU) was used to induce cancer
cell dormancy. We found that cancer cells escape the cytotoxicity of 5-FU by becoming
“dormant”. After exposure to 5-FU, residual non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells
underwent epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), followed by mesenchymalepithelial transition (MET). These EMT-transformed NSCLC cells were in the state of
cell quiescence where cells were not dividing and were arrested in the cell cycle in
G0-G1. The dormant cells underwent an EMT showed characteristics of cancer stem
cells. P53 is strongly accumulated in response to 5-FU-induced dormant cells through
the activation of ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) and TGF-β/
Smad signaling. In contrast to the EMT-transformed cells, MET-transformed cells
showed an increased ability to proliferate, suggesting that dormant EMT cells were
reactivated in the MET process. During the EMT-MET process, DNA repair including
nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) is critical
to dormant cell reactivation. Our findings provide a mechanism to unravel cancer cell
dormancy and reactivation of the cancer cell population.

main cause of cancer recurrence and failure of therapy
[2,3]. Cancer dormancy is characteristic of cell quiescence
where cells are not dividing but at arrest in the cell cycle
in G0-G1. Disseminated tumour cells (DTC) escaping
apoptosis are likely in a dormant cell-cycle arrest stage
[4]. Chemotherapy, which uses drugs to destroy cancer
cells, is a main type of cancer treatment. Nevertheless,
chemoresistance and tumor recurrence after chemotherapy
remain a major etiology of the morbidity and mortality in

INTRODUCTION
Patients with cancer can develop local or
disseminated recurrence after therapy and long periods
of latency, which is a major obstacle preventing cure
and long-term survival in patients [1]. This latency can
be explained by cancer dormancy, a stage in cancer
progression in which residual disease is present but
remains asymptomatic [1]. Cancer cell dormancy is the

cancer patients [5]. It is assumed that dormant cells are
chemotherapy resistant because they are not dividing.
Cancer cells evade chemotherapy drugs by becoming
“dormant”. However, cancer dormancy is poorly
understood, and the mechanisms of how cancer cells
develop dormancy and relapse remain elusive. Oncogenic
signaling might not always be dominant and stem cell
quiescence and stress signaling could overcome oncogenic
signals, allowing tumor cell survival in a dormant state [1].
Accumulating evidence suggests that a subpopulation
of cancer cells exhibit stem-like properties [6]. It is well
recognized that these cancer stem cells (CSCs) are related
to cancer recurrence, metastasis and drug resistance. There
appears to be a causal relationship between CSCs and
the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in solid
tumors [7–10]. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),
and its reverse process mesenchymal-epithelial transition
(MET), refer to the transition in cells between an epithelial
phenotype and a mesenchymal phenotype. Emerging
empirical evidence suggests that there are plenty of
molecular and phenotypic associations between EMT and
drug resistance [11–14]. EMT-transformed cells are also
linked with decreased proliferation or quiescence [5,15].
In this study, we used the chemotherapeutic drug
5- fluorouracil (5-FU), which is an S phase-active
chemotherapeutic agent, with no activity when cells are
in G0 or G1 phase, to induce cancer cell dormancy. We
found that cancer cells that escape cytotoxicity of 5-FU
by becoming “dormant” displayed EMT followed by
MET. The dormant EMT cells showed characteristics
of cancer stem cells. P53 was strongly accumulated in
response to DNA damage and caused cancer cell arrested
in G0-G1 through the activation of ubiquitin ligase
anaphase-promoting complex. During the EMT-MET
process, DNA repair, including nonhomologous end
joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR),
is critical to dormant cell reactivation. Our findings
provide a mechanism to unravel cancer cell dormancy
and regain tumorigenicity. Our study also suggests
therapies that prevent relapse by either sustaining tumor
dormancy by inhibiting DNA repair or by selectively
enhancing chemotherapy sensitivity by inhibiting
APC/C activity.

F-actin. F-actin was assembled into actin stress fibers in
cells underwent EMT, which appeared to have increased
intercellular separation and showed increased formation of
pseudopodia. In contrast, cells underwent MET displayed
cell-cell junction and little formation of pseudopodia
(Figure 1C). We examined the expression of the epithelial
marker E-cadherin and mesenchymal markers, such as
N-cadherin, vimentin, fibronectin, snail, and slug in these
two processes. Enhanced mRNA expression levels for
mesenchymal markers were observed in EMT, along with
an enhanced mRNA expression level for E-cadherin. In
MET, the expression levels of the typical mesenchymal
markers were obviously decreased compared with those in
EMT (Figure 1D, Supplementary Figure S1).

APC/C signaling pathways are activated in
dormant cells underwent an EMT
Cell cycle analysis showed that S-phase entry was
blocked in NSCLC cells that underwent EMT, and cells
were arrested in G0/G1 phase after exposure to 5-FU
(Figure 2A). EMT-transformed cells showed decreased
proliferation detected using an EdU assay, indicating
cells that underwent EMT were in their dormant stage.
On the other hand, following EMT transformation, METtransformed cells showed increased proliferation similar
to untreated control cells (Figure 2B), indicating that
dormant cells were capable of regaining tumorigenicity
during MET.
The cellular response to DNA damage is controlled by
the tumor suppressor p53, which results in cell-cycle arrest
followed by DNA repair. Following treatment with 5-FU, the
expression level of p53 was increased in the residual NSCLC
cells that underwent EMT (Figure 2C). To investigate if the
cell cycle regulation was mediated by anaphase-promoting
complex or cyclosome (APC/C) activation, we performed
an ubiquitination assay in which cells underwent sequential
EMT and MET. The immunoprecipitation was performed
with an antibody recognizing cyclin A2, followed by
detection of endogenously ubiquitinated proteins with
an anti-ubiquitin antibody. The amount of ubiquitinated
cyclin A2 (essential for G1/S and the G2/M transitions)
was increased in EMT-transformed NSCLC cells (Figure
2D). Treatment with the APC/C inhibitor TAME led to the
accumulation of non-degraded cyclin A2 (Figure 2E). To
further investigate if the ubiquitin lagase function is p53dependent, we electro-transfected p53 siRNA and p21
siRNA in EMT- and MET-transformed cells. Knockdown
of p53 and p21 led to an increase of cyclin A2 and decrease
of ubiquitinated cyclin A2 (Figure 2F). We then verified
that the APC/C substrates SKP2, cyclin A2, cyclin D1 were
degraded in EMT-transformed cells. The changes in p27,
p21, and p53 levels were inversely related to the changes in
Skp2 levels (Figure 2C). Knockdown of p21 or inhibition
of APC/C by TAME sensitized NSCLC cells to 5-FU
(Figure 2G). However, knockdown of p53 did not enhance

we demonstrated that 5-FU induced cancer cell dormancy

repair during cell cycle in 5-FU induced EMT-transformed
cells. A COMET assay showed long comet tails after
treatment with 5-FU, and the comet tails were shorter in
the cells underwent EMT, which is indicative of DNA
repair during EMT. There were no substantial differences
in the comet tails between MET-transformed cells and
unexposed control cells, indicating that DNA repair occurs
in both EMT and MET processes (Figure 5A, 5B). The
expressions of the NER, BER, HR and NHEJ pathway
DNA repair-related molecules, including XPC, DDB2,
BRCA1, RAD51, KU70, and others were increased in cells
underwent EMT. NER and BER pathway DNA repairrelated molecules including XPC, DDB2, UNG, SMUG1,
and XRCC1 were decreased in MET-transformed cells
compared with EMT-transformed cells. However, the
activation of imprecise repair HR and NHEJ pathways was
maintained in MET-transformed cells, which is consistent
with the regained ability to proliferate in MET (Figure
5C). RI-1 and AZD8055, which are RAD51 inhibitor
and DNA-PK inhibitor respectively, could sensitize
NSCLC cells to 5-FU (Figure 5D, 5E). In an Array-CGH
assay, the evaluation of DNA copy number changes was
performed by comparing a DNA test isolated from A549
cells underwent EMT or MET against a normal reference
DNA of control A549 cells. A graphical presentation of
the regions of gain (blue) and loss (red) was shown in
Figure 5F. These abnormalities in cells underwent EMT
included gains in chromosome 18,19 and chromosome X.
Losses in chromosome 17 and 19 were shown. Compared
to EMT, cells underwent MET showed more copy number
abnomalities (Figure 5F).

5-FU-induced dormant EMT-transformed cells
display characteristics of CSCs
The acquisition of an EMT phenotype is associated
with tumor aggressiveness and metastasis. Chemotherapyinduced EMT-transformed NSCLC cells showed enhanced
migration and invasion compared with untreated control
and MET cells, with higher expression of metastasisrelated molecules MMP2, MMP9, and caldesmon (Figure
3A, 3B). These EMT-transformed NSCLC cells exhibited
increased expression of CSC marker genes including
CD133, ALDH1, nanog, oct4, c-kit, KLF5, ABCG2,
ABCG5, and others (Figure 3C). EMT-transformed cells
showed more resistance to 5-FU than untreated control
and MET-transformed cells. The sphere formation
ability of EMT-transformed cells was significantly
enhanced compared with that of untreated control and
MET-transformed cells (Figure 3D). Overall, it was
demonstrated that the cells that underwent EMT after
5-FU treatment displayed CSC characteristics.

5-FU induced dormant EMT-transformed cells
are mediated by TGF-β/smad-slug pathway
The TGF-β/smad pathway is a canonical pathway
in the regulation of EMT; meanwhile, blockade of the
pathway was shown to stimulate MET [16]. To identify
whether the pathway is involved in 5-FU induced EMTMET process, we co-transfected SMAD luciferase
reporter plasmid and the pRL-TK vector (10:1) into
untreated control, EMT- and MET-transformed NSCLC
cells. As a result, NSCLC cells underwent EMT showed
increased luciferase activity (Figure 4A). In EMTand MET-transformed cells, increased expressions of
Smad2 and slug were detected. Smad2 was distributed
predominantly in the nucleus of EMT-transformed cells.
There was a corresponding decline in both smad2’s
nuclear translocation and slug’s expression in cells
underwent MET (Figure 4B). LY2109761, the TGF-β/
smad pathway inhibitor, can reverse 5-FU-induced
EMT and inhibit the expression of slug and nuclear
translocation of Smad2 in NSCLC cells underwent EMT
(Figure 4C, 4D). Considering the above, we can conclude
that 5-FU induced the EMT-MET process through TGF-β/
smad-slug signaling.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we found that dormant cancer cells
induced by 5-FU underwent EMT and MET, which is
driven by the TGF-β signaling pathway. In response to
DNA damage, p53 activated APC/C and induced cancer
cell cycle arrest in G0-G1. The dormant cancer cells
underwent EMT displayed characteristics of CSC. DNA
repair occurred during cell dormancy, and eventually the
cells continued to multiply, resulting in the reappearance
of the cancer (Figure 6).
Dormant cancer cells are believed to be involved
in chemotherapy resistance, cancer recurrence and
metastases [17,18]. 5-FU and other chemotherapeutic
drugs were used to enrich the dormant cancer cells
[19,20]. Dormancy is a state in which cancer cells
aggressively escape damage-induced apoptosis and
repair cytotoxic lesions, rather than a passive response to
pharmaceutical therapy. Potential therapeutic approaches
for dormancy are now drawing more attention from basic
and clinical researchers [21]. Several mechanisms can
explain cancer dormancy, including impaired angiogenic
capacity, immunosurveillance and the disruption of
crosstalk between growth factor and adhesion signaling

[1, 22]. Inhibition of ERK signaling was observed in
dormant cancer cells and led to cellular tumor dormancy
through G0-G1 arrest [1, 23]. Stem cell quiescence and
stress signaling might overcome oncogenic signals,
allowing tumor cell survival in a dormant state [1,17,18].
The TGF-β/smad signaling pathway plays a critical
role in regulating the fate of stem cells [24]. Smad2 is
one of the key components downstream of the TGF-β
signaling pathway. It was well documented that Smad2
promotes CSC self-renewal and maintenance [8, 25–27].
The TGF-β/smad pathway is also the key activator in
EMT. Our experimental data showed that the TGF-β/
smad pathway was directly involved in 5-FU induced
EMT-MET. During the EMT-MET process, Smad2 was
shown to be translocated to the cell nucleus. Slug is an
important EMT transcription factor and could be directly
upregulated by the TGF-β/smad pathway [28]. Similar
results were found for Slug expression. Inhibition of the
TGF-β/smad pathway with LY2109761 prevented 5-FUinduced EMT and translocation of Smad2 to the nucleus.
This demonstrated that activation of TGF-β/smad-slug
pathway induce cancer dormancy.

5-FU is a fluoropyrimidine anticancer drug that
disrupts cellular metabolism by inhibiting synthesis of
purines and pyrimidines, thus disrupting DNA synthesis
and RNA translation in target cells [29]. P53 is the core
sensor in response to DNA damage. Under multiple
cellular stress conditions, p53 functions to block cell
cycle progression transiently unless proper DNA repair
occurs [30–33]. APC/C is a type of multifunctional
ubiquitin-protein ligase that targets various substrates for
proteolysis inside and outside of the cell cycle [34]. In
the regulation of the DNA damage checkpoint response,
APC/C is activated and promotes a broad range of
substrates’ proteolysis, such as cyclin A, skp2, cyclin B,
securing, etc. [35]. Recent studies revealed that APC/C
can be activated in a p53 and p21-dependent DNA damage
response [36, 37]. p53 signaling is also involved in the
maintenance of mouse ESC self-renewal by upregulating
nanog [38]. In this study, after exposure to DNA damage
drugs, the residual cancer cells underwent a process of cell
cycle arrest in the p53-p21-APC/C dependent pathway.
Activation of the p53-p21-APC/C pathway contributed to
cell cycle arrest through ubiquitin-dependent degradation

of cyclin A2 and cyclin B1. In addition, the TGF-β/smad
cascade could activate the APC/C complex, mediating
Skp2 degradation and cell cycle arrest [39], suggesting
that the TGF-β/smad pathway may interact with p53-p21APC/C to synergistically regulate cell cycle arrest induced
by 5-FU. Accordingly, we assume that inhibiting the p53p21-APC/C pathway may enhance chemotherapy efficacy
of 5-FU. As proposed, knockdown of p21 or inhibition of
APC/C by TAME could obviously increase cancer cells’
chemosensitivity to 5-FU, which is consistent with studies
demonstrating that TAME could inhibit the mitotic block
and increase paclitaxel efficacy [40].
There appears to be a causal relationship between
CSCs and EMT in solid tumors [10]. EMT and its reverse
process MET represent cells not only with transition
of phenotype, but also the alteration of oncogenic
characteristics. In our study, EMT induced by 5-FU induce
cancer cells with CSC characteristics. However, enhanced
mRNA and protein expression levels of E-cadherin were
observed in the 5-FU-induced fibroblastoid-shape cells
(Figure 1, Supplementary Figure S1). E-cadherin is
expressed in most normal epithelial tissues [41]. Although
downregulation of E-cadherin is a very typical marker of
EMT, loss of E-cadherin expression is not a prerequisite

for EMT and cell motility in some specific situations
[42–45]. The selective loss of E-cadherin can cause
dedifferentiation and invasiveness in human carcinomas,
leading E-cadherin to be classified as a tumor suppressor
[46]. Other research also found that expression level of
E-cadherin was increased in dormant cancer cells [47].
E-cadherin can induce an increase in the level of the
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(kip1) and a late
reduction in cyclin D1 protein [48]. We presume that,
like p53, E-cadherin arrests cancer cells in G0-G1 phase
and induces cancer cell dormancy. Knocking down the
expression of E-cadherin enhanced the sensitivity of
cancer cell to 5-FU (Supplementary Figure S1).
How dormant cancer cells are reactivated and
regain malignant proliferation remain to be elucidated.
In our experiment, we found through the EMT-MET
process, residual cancer cells escape the cytotoxicity
of 5-FU by becoming dormant and regain malignant
proliferation ability by DNA repair. G1 phase arrest is
always accompanied by DNA repair. In this respect, we
sought to investigate the efficacy of DNA repair after
DNA damage. A comet assay showed that 5-FU caused
DSBs, and, in the EMT-MET process, the DSBs were
repaired. Cells that underwent EMT and MET showed

activation of XPC, XRCC1, BRCA1, RAD51, KU70,
etc., indicating that dormant cells utilize DNA repair
to regain the ability to proliferate. 5-FU-induced DNA
damage triggered most DNA repair pathways including
nucleotide excision repair (NER), base excision
repair (BER), homologous recombination (HR) and
nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). However, in MET,
DSB were repaired mainly by NHEJ. DNA DSBs can be
repaired by one of two major pathways: non-homologous
end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination
(HR), depending on whether cells are in G1 or S/
G2 phase, respectively [49]. There are canonical and
alternative pathways of NHEJ involved in end-joining
of the broken DSBs [50]. In contrast to canonical NHEJ,
which is considered as a guardian of genomic stability,
alternative NHEJ is considered a major source of
genomic instability [51,52]. Emerging evidence suggest
that defects in a main repair pathway for DSBs and NHEJ
lead to upregulation of an alternative or “back-up” repair
that can create chromosomal deletions and translocations
[49,53]. Our data suggest that the NHEJ pathway that is
activated during MET increases the genomic instability
of NSCLC cells and allows dormant EMT-transformed
cells to regain ability to proliferate.
This study provides an in vitro model that uses 5-FU
to induce dormant EMT-transformed cells and reactivated
MET-transformed cells. It is important to investigate the
cellular or serum biomarkers to help detect the dormant
status. This study also offers two possibilities : First, to
prevent reactivation of dormant cancer cells by inhibiting
NHEJ DNA repair, and second, to enhance chemotherapy
sensitivity by inhibiting APC/C activity and reducing
chemotherapy-resistant dormant cancer cells.

Total RNA was isolated from cells using Trizol®
reagent (15596-026, Invitrogen, USA). cDNA was
synthesized from the total RNA with RevertAid First
Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (K1622, Fermentas,USA).
Real-time PCR was performed using the Bio-Rad IQTM5
Multicolor Real-Time PCR detection System (Bio-Rad,
USA). The data were analysed using iQ5 software.
mRNA PCR quantification used 2ΔΔCt method against
the GAPDH for normalization. The data are representative
of the means of three experiments. Student’s t-test was
applied to compare two or more values; P <0.05 indicated
that there was a significant difference. The qPCR protocol
was 95°C for 30 sec and 40 cycles of 95°C for 5 sec and
60°C for 30 sec. A final melting curve analysis (60–95°C)
was conducted. The standard curve was produced using a
slope of approximately -3.32 (~100% efficiency). RT-PCR
primers were listed in Table 1.

Cytoskeleton staining
After fixation of 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for
20min, cell cytoskeleton staining was performed by using
Phalloidin-FITC (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO,USA)
at the final concentration of 1μg/ml for 1.5 h at 37°C,
then nucleus was co-stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI) (C1002, Beyotime Biotechnology,
Hangzhou, China) for 3 min at room temperature.
Representative pictures were photographed with FSX100
(Olympus) in random fields.

In vitro migration and invasion assays
In vitro cell migration and invasion assays were
performed using transwell chambers (3422, Corning,
USA). For invasion assay, before cell seeding, transwell
plates(Corning, 356234) were coated with Matrigel (BD)
and placed in the cell culture hood for 1 hour at 37°C.
200 ¼l of the cell suspension (1×105 cells per well) was
seeded in the inserts and cultured in serum-free medium.
Normal growth medium were placed in underneath wells.
The cells were then cultured for 16 h (migration) and 24h
(invasion). Migrated cells were fixed in 100% methanol
and stained with 0.1% crystal violet (w/v). Invasive cells
on the lower surface of the membrane were stained by
dipping inserts in the staining solution for 20 minutes.

SMAD luciferase reporter assay

The antibodies were used as follows: p53 (sc-126, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA), p27 (sc-528, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, CA, USA), Ub Antibody (sc-9133, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA), β-actin (sc-47778, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA); skp2 (ab183039,Abcam,
USA); p21 (10355-1-AP, Proteintech,), cyclin A2 (182021-AP, Proteintech,), cyclin B1 (55004-1-AP, Proteintech),
slug (12129-1-AP, Proteintech); smad2 (86F7, Cell
Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA); Histone 3 (AH433,
Beyotime Biotechnology, China); GAPDH (TA802563,
Origene, USA).

SMAD luciferase reporter plasmid (GM-021043,
Genomeditech, USA) was used to investigate whether
TGFβ/smad signaling pathway was activated in the
process of EMT induced by 5-FU. After seeded in 12-well
plate overnight, cells were co-transfected with SMAD
luciferase reporter plasmid and Renilla luciferase vector
pRL-TK vector (Promega) at a ratio of 10:1. pRL-TK was
co-transfected to normalize the transfection efficiency
in each experiment. Cells were cultured for additional
36 h. Luciferase activity of each group was measured
by Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System referring to
the manufacturer’s instructions(Promega, E1910). The
firefly luciferase and renilla activities were measured with
PAEASIFMTM Detection Platform (Beckman Coulter).
The relative luciferase activity was represented by the
ratio of firefly luciferase activity to renilla luciferase
activity. Experiments were performed in three independent
replicates and data were shown as means.

EdU cell proliferation assay
Cell proliferation was detected with Click-iT®EdU
Microplate Assay Kit (C10310-3, Ribobio, Beijing,
China). Cells were planted in 24 well plate (1×105
cells/well). EdU (50¼M, 300¼L) which is modified
by fluorescence was added into wells and incubated in
chamber for 3 hours as the protocol indicates. After EdU
staining, cells were counterstained with DAPI. EdUpositive cells was imaged randomly by fluorescence
microscope FSX100 (Olympas, Japan) and the ratio of
positive ones was counted.

Western blot assay
The cell lysate used for western blotting was
extracted using RIPA lysis buffer (CW2333,Cwbio,
Beijing, China) containing protease inhibitors (Roche,
Germany). Nucleoprotein was obtained by using
Nucleoprotein Protein Extraction Kit (P0027,Beyotime
Biotechnology, Hangzhou, China). Proteins were
quantified using the BCA Protein Assay Kit
(CW0014,Cwbio, Beijing, China). The western blot
system was established using a BioRad Bis-Tris Gel
system according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Bio-Rad, CA, USA). Briefly, Approximately 50 μg of
protein were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred
to PVDF membranes (ISEQ00010,Millipore, Danvers,
MA, USA). The membranes were blocked by 5% nonfat
milk. The membranes were incubated with the primary
antibody overnight at 4°C, followed by a brief wash
with PBST and incubation with secondary antibody
for 1 h at 37°C. An anti-GAPDH antibody control was
purchased from Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA) and
was used as a loading control. Finally, ECL solution
(WBLUC0100,Millipore,USA) was added to cover the
blot surface and the signals were captured and the intensity
of the bands was quantified using the Bio-Rad ChemiDoc
XRS+ system(Bio-Rad, CA, USA). For detecting the
ubiquitination of cyclin A2, cells were treated with MG132 (20μM, 8h) (M8699,Sigma), then total protein was
collected using lysis buffer added with N-Ethylmaleimide
(E3876, Sigma,USA). Cyclin A2 was immunoprecipitated
with cyclin A2 antibody (4°C, 12h), followed with Protein
A/G PLUS-Agarose (Santa Cruz, sc-2003) incubation
(4°C, 4h). The precipitates were washed with lysis buffer
for 3 times, then eluted and boiled in sample loading buffer
and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis.

Si-RNA interference
For small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments,
siRNA duplexes were used to reduce p53, p21 and
E-cadherin protein expression, respectively (Ribobio,
China). Briefly, cells were trypsinized and 1×106 cells
were suspended in 100μl Opti-MEM or medium without
FBS, then added with 5 μL of 20 μM siRNA duplexes, and
electro-transfected by using Super Electroporator NEPA21
(NEPA GENE, Japan). Cells were then transferred to 35mm tissue culture dishes with 2 mL RPMI1640 medium.
The siRNA sequences for knockdown of target genes are
shown in Table 2.

Cell-cycle analysis
Cells (2×106/mL) were fixed with 70% cold ethanol
overnight, then incubated in ice-cold PBS containing 50
mg RNase A (Takara, Japan) at 37°C for 1 hour. Cells were
treated with propidium iodide at the final concentration
of 5μg/ml (ST511, Beyotime Biotechnology, Hangzhou,
China), and incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature.
Then, cells were subjected to flow cytometry for analysis.

Cell count assay
After treatment, cells were washed with PBS and
fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 20min. then,
cells were stained with 1% (w/v) crystal violet dye
(C0121, Beyotime Biotechnology, Hangzhou, China). The
number of cells was quantified by counting the cells in six
random fields under a lighted microscope.

Alkaline comet assay
The alkaline comet assay was done according to
the procedure of alkaline Comet assay kit (GMS10074.3,
Genmed Scientifics, USA) with minor modification.
Briefly, 3× 105 cells were pelleted and resuspended in
1mL PBS. 10 ¼L sample of resuspended cells were then
mixed with an equal volume of prewarmed low–melting
point agarose. The agarose-cell mixture was placed on
fully frosted (one side) slide precoated with agarose
and spread it gently with a coverslip. After 10 min at
4°C, the slides were immersed in precooled (4°C) lysis
solution for 80 min in a dark chamber. After soaking
with electrophoresis buffer for 30 min, the slides were
subjected to electrophoresis (20V, 140mA) for 20 min.
Finally, the cells were stained with 10μg/ml propidium
iodide (Beyotime Biotechnology, ST511), and individual
cells were viewed using an Olympus FSX100 fluorescence
microscope. DNA damage was quantified in at least 50
randomly selected comets per slide, and DNA damaged
cells with comet’s tail were canculated and statistically
analysed.
