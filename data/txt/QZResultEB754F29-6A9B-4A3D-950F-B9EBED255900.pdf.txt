Abstract
We have previously reported that bispecific antibodies directed
to different target antigens on lymphoma cells and to the death
receptor CD95/Fas/Apo-1 selectively kill these cells, thus
providing an attractive strategy for the selective stimulation
of CD95 on the surface of tumor cells. Here, we further explore
the general applicability of this approach under more stringent
conditions using various bispecific antibodies directed to
different target antigens on glioblastoma cells which express
relatively low levels of CD95. We found that bispecific CD95
antibodies targeting the neuronal glial antigen-2 induce
CD95-mediated apoptosis selectively in glioblastoma cells
expressing this target antigen. A recombinant bispecific
single-chain antibody was as effective as a chemically
hybridized F(ab¶)2 fragment with identical specificities. In
contrast, a bispecific F(ab¶)2 fragment binding to the epidermal
growth factor receptor on the glioblastoma cells failed to
induce apoptosis. This is most likely due to the exclusively
unicellular binding of this particular fragment to target cells
expressing both the epidermal growth factor receptor and
CD95. If this type of binding in a cis configuration is favored by
a particular bispecific antibody, rather than a bicellular
binding in trans, effective cross-linking of CD95 does not
occur and apoptosis is not induced. To facilitate bicellular
binding in a trans configuration, we constructed a bispecific
antibody directed to the extracellular matrix protein tenascin.
As expected, this reagent was the most effective of all the
antibodies tested. The presence of sensitizing reagents such as
cycloheximide and various cytostatic drugs further enhanced
antibody-mediated killing of the tumor cells. We believe that
these results may point the way to a successful application of
bispecific CD95 antibodies in experimental tumor therapy.

Introduction
CD95/Fas/Apo-1 is a cell surface receptor capable of inducing
apoptotic death of human cells (1, 2). Similar to the physiologic
ligand of this receptor, CD95L, agonistic anti-CD95 antibodies may
induce apoptosis if binding to CD95 occurs in a multimeric format,
e.g., as pentameric IgM or self-aggregating IgG3. Alternatively, antiCD95 antibodies may be cross-linked by Fc receptors on neighboring
cells or by secondary antibodies to achieve agonistic activity (3).

Because many tumor cells express CD95, the use of agonistic
anti-CD95 antibodies for tumor therapy has been vigorously
pursued after initial characterization of prototypic CD95 antibodies (4, 5). However, it soon became obvious that, at least in
its most simple form of applying agonistic anti-CD95 antibodies
or recombinant CD95L to patients, this approach fails because
many normal cell types express functional CD95 and may be
killed by agonistic antibodies. In mice, for example, agonistic
anti-CD95 antibodies induce severe liver cell apoptosis and acute
hepatic failure (6). Several strategies have been suggested to
overcome the toxic side effects induced by such antibodies, e.g.,
by using compounds which attenuate the liver toxicity of these
reagents (7, 8).
We have previously shown that bispecific F(ab¶)2 fragments
[bs-F(ab¶)2] with specificity for CD95 and different target
antigens on lymphoma cells, such as CD20 and CD40, induce
the apoptosis of cells positive for CD95 and the respective target
antigen. Lymphoma cells expressing CD95 but no target antigen
were not killed (9). Subsequently, Samel et al. reported similar
results using recombinant fusion proteins consisting of a singlechain antibody directed to the tumor-associated fibroblastactivating protein and the CD95L protein (10). In our view,
bispecific reagents of the described kind may constitute an
attractive strategy to increase the specificity of agonistic antiCD95 antibodies. It is obvious, however, that using those
antibodies for tumor cell killing faces not only a specificity,
but also a sensitivity problem: many tumor cells have lost their
susceptibility to CD95-mediated cell death either by downregulation of CD95 or by tilting the balance of proapoptotic
and antiapoptotic intracellular proteins towards resistance (11,
12). In fact, the apoptosis-resistant phenotype has been linked to
an increased metastatic potential in tumor cells (13). This
sensitivity problem is now well recognized and numerous
compounds have been described which are capable of enhancing
the susceptibility of tumor cells towards apoptotic cell death
in general and towards CD95-mediated apoptosis in particular
(14–18).
In this article, we extend the approach of selective CD95
stimulation with bispecific antibodies using various target
antigens expressed on glioblastoma cells. We have noted in
preliminary experiments that CD95 expression on such cells, as
well as on other solid tumor cells, is considerably lower than that
found on the lymphoma cell lines used in our previous experiments. This necessitated the exploration of the activity of CD95triggering bispecific antibodies under more stringent conditions.
In particular, we assessed the influence of antibody format, nature
of the target antigen, and combination with sensitizing reagents,
with the aim of identifying compounds which are optimally suited
for the induction of selective CD95-mediated apoptosis in tumor
cells.

the respective ordinate.

Materials and Methods
Cells and reagents. The SKMel63 melanoma cell line was a gift from
Dr. Brigitte Gückel (Department of Gynecology, University of Tübingen,
Tübingen, Germany). The glioblastoma cell lines, U87MG and LN-18, were
kindly provided by M. Weller, Department of Neurology, University of
Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany. SKMel63 cells and the lymphoma cell line
SKW6.4 (American Type Culture Collection) were kept in RPMI 1640 and
both glioblastoma cell lines in DMEM, supplemented with 100 units/mL
penicillin, 100 Ag/mL streptomycin, 50 Amol/L of h-mercaptoethanol,
1 mmol/L of sodium pyruvate, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum.
Hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies directed at neuronal glial
antigen-2 (NG2; 9.2.27) and CD40 (G28-5) were kindly provided by R.A.
Reisfeld, La Jolla, CA and purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection, respectively. Antibodies were purified from hybridoma supernatant using protein A affinity chromatography. The antibody directed to
tenascin (BC24) was purified from mouse ascites (Sigma) also using protein
A affinity chromatography. The purified antibody directed to epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR; mAb 425) was kindly provided by Merck
Darmstadt (Darmstadt, Germany). The CD95 antibody (Apo-1) and switch
variants derived thereof have been previously described (3). The CD95 crosslinking antibody directed against mouse Fcg portions was purchased from
Dianova; it was used at 10 Ag/mL. Purified CD95L and the pan-caspase
inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK were obtained from Alexis Biochemicals, Gruenberg,
Germany. Cycloheximide and EDTA were purchased from Sigma. The
topoisomerase-I inhibitor Topotecan was obtained from SmithKline
Beecham Pharma and the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478 was from
Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Agonistic peptides derived from the second
mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC) with the sequences
AVPIAQKRQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK and AVPIAQKGGGRRRRRRRRGC were
synthesized as amides by Dr. M. Fotin-Mleczek, Institute for Cell Biology,
University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany; histone deacetylase inhibitors
valproic acid and soberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, were kindly provided by
M. Bitzer, Medical Clinic III, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany.
Generation of bispecific antibody fragments. Bispecific F(ab¶)2
fragments were prepared by selective reduction and reoxidation of hinge
region disulfide bonds as described previously. The reaction conditions used
prevent the formation of homodimers and allow effective hybridization of
modified Fab¶ fragments of the parental antibodies (19). For this study, we
hybridized the IgG2a variant of the Apo-1 (CD95) antibody to antibodies
directed against the glioblastoma-associated antigens NG2, EGFR, CD40,
and tenascin and obtained four bispecific constructs termed NG2  CD95,
EGFR  CD95, CD40  CD95, and TEN  CD95. An equimolar mixture of

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (4). February 15, 2008

modified, nonhybridized Fab¶ fragments of the parental anti-NG2 and antiCD95 antibodies was used as a control in some experiments (Fab¶ mix).
Generation and characterization of the bispecific single-chain
antibody bsscFv NG2  CD95. mRNA from the mouse IgG2a/n producing
hybridoma anti–Apo-1 was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy Kit (Qiagen).
Oligo-dT (15) primer and the cDNA synthesis kit (Roche) were used for
the generation of double-stranded cDNA. The blunted double-stranded
cDNA was circularized with the T4-DNA-Ligase (Roche) at 16jC. For
the amplification of both unknown variable antibody gene segments,
oligonucleotides specific for the constant region of g2a (2a-back, 5¶-catgcaaatgcccagcacctaacctcttgggtg-3¶; 2a-forward, 5¶-gaggacagggcttgattgtgggccctctgggct-3¶) and n (CK-back, 5¶-acttctaccccaaagacatcaatgtcaag-3¶; CK-forward,
5¶-tgttcaagaagcacacgactgaggcacctcc-3¶) were used in an inverse PCR.
Specific amplicons (heavy 1,600 bp; n 900 bp) were cloned into the TOPO
pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and the unknown VH and VL domains were
sequenced. For the generation of a single-chain Fv fragment, VH and VL
domains were amplified with overlapping primers adding an oligonucleotide stretch coding for a glycin-serin linker, (G4S)3, and assembled in a
SOE-PCR. AgeI and SfiI restriction sites were added 5¶ and 3¶, respectively,
for an in-frame insertion in an eukaryotic expression vector for bispecific
fusion proteins as previously described (20). This resulted in an expression
vector with an insert coding for a 57-kDa bispecific single-chain Fv
fragment containing the variable regions of the anti–Apo-1 (CD95)- and the
NG2 antibody 9.2.27 in the following 5¶ to 3¶ orientation: VH-CD95–VL-CD95–
VH-NG2–VL-NG2. The mouse myeloma cell line Sp2/0 was transfected with the
linearized vector and selected with G418 (1 mg/mL).
The bispecific single-chain antibody was purified from cell culture
supernatant by protein L affinity chromatography and characterized as
previously described for the bsscFv antibody r28M (21). Analysis on SDS
page yielded a single band corresponding to the expected molecular weight
of 57 kDa.
FACS analysis. To determine the antigen expression level on glioblastoma cells, these cells were incubated for 1 h at 4jC with a saturating
concentration (5 Ag/mL) of the respective parental antibodies, washed and
stained with phycoerythrin-labeled F(ab¶)2 fragments of a goat anti-mouse
IgG antibody (Dianova) at dilutions recommended by the manufacturer.
Isotype controls were purchased from BD PharMingen. Cells were analyzed
in a FACSCalibur equipped with the CellQuest Pro software (Becton
Dickinson).
Cell killing assays. To measure direct apoptosis of U87MG cells, cells
were labeled with 51Cr (100 ACi/mL) for 1 h, washed, plated in triplicate in
96-well microtiter plates (3.5  104/well) and incubated for 20 h with
bispecific tumor antigen  CD95 constructs. For bystander lysis experiments,

Tumor Cell Killing with Bispecific CD95 Antibodies
2  104 51Cr-labeled SKW6.4 cells per well were incubated with bispecific
CD95 antibodies in the absence or presence of tumor cells expressing the
relevant target antigens (4  104 / well) for 20 h. The percentage of killed
tumor cells was calculated according to the standard formula (cpmx
cpmspont) / (cpmmax cpmspont) where cpmmax is radioactivity released by
detergent-treated target cells and cpmspont is spontaneous release in the
absence of antibodies.
Alternatively, the viability of LN-18 cells was determined by seeding 3.5 
104 tumor cells/well in 96-well plates. After antibody treatment in the
presence or absence of cycloheximide, the cell culture medium was
removed and surviving cells were stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 20%
methanol for 20 min at room temperature. The plates were washed
extensively under running tap water, air-dried, and surviving cells were
quantified by measuring absorbance at 550 nm in an ELISA reader
(Spectramax 340; Molecular Devices).

Results
Selective killing of tumor target cells by bispecific antibodies does not depend on the antibody format but on the
nature of the target antigen used. We first constructed bispecific
CD95 antibodies directed to three different target antigens on
glioblastoma cells: NG2, EGFR, and CD40. The antibodies were
generated as chemically hybridized bispecific F(ab¶)2 fragments [bsF(ab¶)2]. The antibody targeting NG2 was constructed in addition as
a recombinant bispecific single-chain Fv antibody (bs-scFv) as
described in Materials and Methods. In Fig. 1, binding of the NG2-

and EGFR-targeting constructs to CD95 expressing SKW6.4
lymphoma cells and to SKMel63 cells expressing the target
antigens NG2 and EGFR is depicted. A somewhat reduced binding
to CD95 was noted for the recombinant bispecific single-chain
antibody (A). Likewise, binding of this reagent to its target antigen
NG2 was slightly reduced if compared with the bs-F(ab¶)2 with NG2
 CD95 specificity (B). Obviously, the expression of NG2 on the
SKMel63 cells largely exceeds that of EGFR (note the different
scales for the mean fluorescence intensity values in Fig. 1B).
However, in the context of the following experiments, it is more
interesting that the avidity of the EGFR targeting bs-F(ab¶)2 seems
to be superior to that of the NG2 targeting antibodies.
We then tested the capability of these antibodies and the bsF(ab¶)2 targeting CD40 (CD40  CD95) to induce apoptosis in two
glioblastoma cell lines with different antigenic profiles. The
U87MG cell line expresses CD95 and the three target antigens
used for the construction of bispecific antibodies in these
experiments: NG2, EGFR, and CD40. In contrast, the LN-18 cell
line expresses only one of these antigens, EGFR. On both cell lines,
CD95 expression is more than one magnitude lower (Fig. 2A and
B) than previously observed on various lymphoma cells (9). In all
experiments, both constructs containing a NG2 specificity, the
bispecific single-chain and the F(ab¶)2 fragment, induced significant
and comparable killing of U87MG cells (Fig. 2C) indicating that
the somewhat reduced binding activity of the single-chain

antibody does not affect its function substantially. In general, the
extent of apoptosis induction by the NG2 targeting antibodies was
somewhat lower than that induced by the cross-linked parental
anti-CD95 antibody. Without sensitization, apoptosis reached 10%
to 30% after 20 h depending on the somewhat variable sensitivity
of the tumor cells in different experiments. For all antibodies,
maximal killing required sensitization by the protein synthesis
inhibitor cycloheximide. In the presence of cycloheximide, a
moderate induction of apoptosis was noted even for the bispecific
antibody targeting CD40, an antigen expressed at relatively low
levels on the U87MG cells. Bispecific antibodies recognizing EGFR
were even less effective than those targeting CD40 (Fig. 2C),
although the expression of EGFR exceeds that of CD40 on this cell
line (Fig. 2A).
The EGFR targeting bs-F(ab¶)2 also failed to induce apoptosis in
LN-18 cells. On these cells, EGFR expression is higher than on
U87MG, whereas NG2 and CD40 are not expressed (Fig. 2B). Thus,
although more sensitive to CD95-mediated apoptosis than U87MG
cells, the LN-18 cells are not killed by any of the bispecific
antibodies discussed thus far. This remained true in the presence of
cycloheximide: the standard concentration of this reagent alone
induced f40% apoptosis, and none of the bispecific antibodies
further increased this percentage (Fig. 2D).
In all experiments described above, inhibition of killing by the
caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK confirmed that cell death was due
to the induction of apoptosis (data not shown). Taken together,
these findings show that (a) bispecific antibodies with NG2 
CD95 specificity in two different formats induce apoptosis
selectively in cells carrying the NG2 antigen and (b) failure of
the EGFR targeting bispecific antibody cannot be attributed to an
insufficient binding avidity or to a low EGFR expression level on
the target cells.
In subsequent experiments, we ruled out that failure of the
EGFR targeting bs-F(ab¶)2 was due to modulation of the EGFR or
to the stimulation of antiapoptotic pathways by this receptor. Using
flow cytometry, we could not detect the down-regulation
of EGFR expression under the experimental conditions used.
Moreover, AG1478, an inhibitor of intracellular EGFR signaling,

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (4). February 15, 2008

did not enhance the activity of the EGFR  CD95 bs-F(ab¶)2 (data
not shown).
Successful killing of target cells with bispecific antibodies
requires trans engagement of CD95 and the target antigen. To
determine whether the EGFR  CD95 bs-F(ab¶)2, is capable of
inducing apoptosis in innocent bystander cells, we labeled CD95sensitive SKW6.4 lymphoma cells which neither express NG2 nor
EGFR with 51Cr. Bystander lysis of these cells was then assessed in
the presence and absence of the two glioblastoma cell lines used as
targets in the experiments described above. In these experiments,
CD95 and the target antigen are provided on different cells and the
glioblastoma cells expressing NG2 and EGFR, respectively, allow for
a bicellular binding of the bispecific antibodies, and thus, for
effective cross-linking of CD95 on the SKW6.4 bystander cells.
Figure 3 shows that in these experiments, the EGFR  CD95 bsF(ab¶)2 induces apoptosis in SKW6.4 bystander cells if EGFRexpressing glioblastoma target cells were also present. In fact, the
bispecific F(ab¶)2 fragment targeting EGFR was even more effective
than the one binding to NG2 if LN-18 cells were used as ‘‘transpresenting cells.’’ As expected, bs-F(ab¶)2 targeting the NG2 antigen
failed to induce bystander killing in the presence of LN-18 cells
because these cells do not express NG2. In conclusion, these
experiments confirm that the EGFR  CD95 bs-F(ab¶)2 is
functionally active in a bicellular trans configuration and that it
fails, however, if bound in a unicellular fashion to target cells
expressing EGFR and CD95 on the same cell surface (see Fig. 4).
Obviously, the ability to cross-link CD95 in a trans configuration
varies with the target antigen used.
We then reasoned that target antigens that are expressed on the
extracellular matrix rather than on the target cell itself might be
particularly suited for trans presentation of anti-CD95 within a
bispecific construct. Therefore, we generated a bispecific CD95
antibody targeting tenascin, an extracellular matrix protein known
to be produced by most glioblastoma cells. In Fig. 5, it is shown
that this antibody induces apoptosis in both cell lines, U87MG and
LN-18. The efficiency of killing was comparable to that of crosslinked parental anti-CD95 antibody. In most experiments, it
exceeded that of the NG2 targeting bs-F(ab¶2) (Fig. 6). In contrast,

Tumor Cell Killing with Bispecific CD95 Antibodies

Figure 4. Induction of apoptosis by bispecific antibodies
directed to a tumor-associated antigen (TAA ) and the
death receptor CD95 requires cross-linking of CD95, that
is binding in a trans (A) rather than in a cis (B )
configuration. In the absence of the tumor-associated
antigen, neither of these is possible and apoptosis does
not occur (C ). TAA-negative but CD95-positive cells
may be killed in the presence of tumor-associated
antigen–positive cells ‘‘presenting’’ the bispecific antibody
in trans. Note that effective trans presentation can occur
despite the presence of CD95 and possibly cis binding on
the presenting cells provided that the expression of the
tumor-associated antigen exceeds that of CD95 (D ).
In analogy to the situation in D, trans presentation may be
preferred if a tumor-associated antigen is expressed on
the extracellular matrix rather than on the tumor cell itself.

killing of CD95-sensitive SKW6.4 cells by the TEN  CD95
construct was negligible (data not shown).
Various cytostatic drugs enhance CD95-induced apoptosis
of tumor cells. In most of the experiments described above,
induction of maximal apoptosis in tumor cells by the bispecific
antibodies required sensitization by cycloheximide, a reagent
inhibiting protein synthesis. In initial experiments, we recognized
that the sensitizing function of this reagent could be substituted by
several cytostatic drugs of which the anthracycline doxorubicin and
the topoisomerase inhibitor topotecan were the most effective
(data not shown). Figure 6 shows that topotecan also enhances
apoptosis induction by the bispecific antibodies targeting NG2 and
tenascin, respectively.
In contrast, several other reagents reported to enhance the
sensitivity of cells towards TRAILR- or CD95-mediated apoptosis,
such as HDAC inhibitors or agonistic SMAC peptides, failed to

enhance the apoptotic activity of the NG2  CD95–bispecific
antibodies (data not shown).

Discussion
The starting point of this study was our previous finding that
bispecific antibodies directed to CD95 and different target antigens
on lymphoma cells induce apoptosis selectively in cells carrying the
respective target antigen. Because CD95 expression on solid tumor
cells is generally lower than on lymphatic cells, the activity of
bispecific antibodies targeting antigens on such cells was unclear.
We found that bispecific CD95 antibodies directed to NG2 as a
target antigen could induce selective apoptosis under these more
stringent conditions. This holds true not only for the bispecific
F(ab¶)2 format used in most of our experiments: we could show for
the first time that a bispecific CD95 antibody in a recombinant

single-chain format exerts comparable activity. Recombinant
bispecific antibodies are viewed as an attractive alternative option
for large-scale production, which is still a considerable hurdle for
the clinical evaluation of bispecific antibodies.
Despite a clearly demonstrable effect, killing by all bispecific
antibodies was not as effective as that reported previously using
lymphoma cells as targets. To reach maximal apoptosis, the
presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide was
required. Given the relatively low amount of CD95 on the
glioblastoma cells, these findings were not unexpected. What
was surprising, however, was the almost complete failure of the
EGFR  CD95 antibody. This failure could neither be explained by
inferior EGFR expression or antibody affinity, nor was it due to
the induction of antiapoptotic signaling after stimulation of the
EGFR. The most likely explanation for this phenomenon was
provided by experiments in which the EGFR  CD95 antibody
was used to kill 51Cr-labeled CD95-sensitive but EGFR-negative
bystander cells in the presence of EGFR-positive ‘‘presenting cells’’
which allow bicellular binding of the bispecific antibody and
effective cross-linking of CD95 on the bystander cells. In this
situation, the bispecific EGFR  CD95 antibody turned out to be
fully active in killing the EGFR-negative bystander cells. Therefore,
we hypothesize that the failure of this construct to induce the
apoptosis of EGFR-positive cells is due to its preferential binding
in a ‘‘unicellular’’ cis configuration when EGFR and CD95 are
expressed on the same cell. This prevents effective mutual crosslinking of CD95 in trans, which is obviously required for the
effective stimulation of CD95 with bispecific antibodies (see
Fig. 4).
In conclusion, the experiments discussed above indicate that
the activity of bispecific antibodies stimulating CD95 does not
only depend on the overall expression—but also on a particular
architecture of the target antigen in the cell surface, allowing
optimal ‘‘presentation’’ of the CD95 specificity in a trans
configuration. Thus, antigens expressed by the extracellular matrix
around tumors, such as tenascin and the fibroblast-activating
protein used by Wajant et al. as a target antigen for the

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (4). February 15, 2008

construction of bifunctional CD95L fusion proteins (10), might be
particularly suited for effective targeting with bispecific CD95
antibodies. Tenascin is a well-known extracellular matrix protein
produced by glioblastoma cells (22) and radiolabeled antibodies
directed to this protein have been used for the immunotherapy
of patients with gliomas (23). The bispecific tenascin  CD95
antibody we have constructed turned out to be the most effective
of all bispecific CD95 antibodies tested. This does not formally
prove, but strongly argues for, the hypothesis that successful
stimulation of CD95 with bispecific antibodies requires mutual
cross-linking by trans-bound antibodies. In this context, it should
be noted that the activity of chemically hybridized bispecific
F(ab¶)2 fragments was comparable to that of a bispecific singlechain antibody, indicating that the flexibility of the physiologic
hinge region does not limit effective ‘‘trans presentation.’’
On the one hand, the hypothesis discussed above poses some
restrictions in considering the general applicability of the concept
of selective stimulation of the CD95 death receptor with bispecific
antibodies, when the target antigen and CD95 are expressed on
the same cell. Some, but not all, bispecific constructs might work
in the desired way and allow effective CD95 cross-linking under
these conditions. On the other hand, our results might provide
some clues as to which target antigens might be particularly
suitable for the selective induction of apoptosis with bispecific
reagents.
Nevertheless, the direct apoptosis-inducing activity of agonistic
CD95 antibodies faces another restriction by the well-established
resistance of many tumor cells towards apoptosis in general.
CD95-mediated killing of such cells requires sensitization with
reagents blocking protein synthesis, such as cycloheximide.
Because it has been reported that conventional cytostatic drugs
may sensitize tumor cells towards apoptosis, we tested a panel of
these reagents together with bispecific CD95 antibodies. We
found that several of these drugs act synergistically with CD95
agonists, topotecan and doxorubicin being the most effective. We
have also tested several compounds which have been reported to
interfere with death receptor–mediated apoptosis in a more

defined way, such as (a) HDAC inhibitors (17), (b) specific
peptides mimicking the function of the apoptosis-enhancing
SMAC protein (24), and (c) the alkyl-lysophospholipid edelfosine
(25). A clear-cut synergizing effect was not observed in any of
these cases. Perhaps the most obvious explanation for this is that
the complex interplay of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic signaling
within the cell may differ considerably if different cell lines are
used. Nevertheless, we have identified some conventional
cytostatic drugs capable of enhancing the selective induction of
apoptosis by bispecific CD95 antibodies. Thus, the concept of
selective CD95 stimulation using bispecific antibodies or fusion

by

Dr. L. W. Alvarez on meson physics has been tentative
ly scheduled. On Tuesday night, June 23, Dr. L. H.
Gray of the Hammersmith Hospital, London, will speak

ERRATUM

The following correction should be made in the arti
cle by Beck and Valentine, â€œThe
Aerobic Carbohydrate
Metabolism
Glycolysis
substitute

of Leukocytes
in Health and Leukemia.
I.
and Respiration,â€•
November,
1952, page 821;
for the last paragraph:

The data in Table 3 permit several interesting calcu
lations.

If one compares

the amount

of glucose

actually

disappearing with the sum of the amount equivalent to
lactic

acid

produced

plus

that

equivalent

to 02 con

by the glucose utilized by 16 per cent in CLL. If the as
sumption is made that, in this respect, the myeloid and
lymphoid celLsof leukemia are similar to those of nor
ma! blood, it may be that the computed

normal figure

represents a summation of the myeloid (M) and
lymphoid (L) cells that make up the normal leukocyte
population.

Thus,

if M = +0.27

and

L = â€”0.16 and

the normal differential is 65 per cent M and So per cent
L, then

0.65 (+0.27)
+ 0.35 (â€”0.16) = +0.12
sumption, it is seen that the amount of glucose â€œcleav
age productsâ€•exceeds the amount of glucose utilized b
a figure identical to the observed +0.12 for normal
12 per cent in N and 27 per cent in CML and is exceeded leukocytes.
