of Glioblastoma by Reversing the Warburg Effect

Abstract
Glioblastoma multiforme is the most aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. Overexpression of the EGF
receptor (EGFR) is recognized as a widespread oncogenic signature in glioblastoma multiforme, but the
complexity of its contributions is not fully understood, nor the most effective ways to leverage anti-EGFR
therapy in this setting. Hypoxia is known to drive the aggressive character of glioblastoma multiforme by
promoting aerobic glycolysis rather than pyruvate oxidation carried out in mitochondria (OXPHOS), a phenomenon termed the Warburg effect, which is a general feature of oncogenesis. In this study, we report that
hypoxia drives expression of the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK1) and EGFR along with the hypoxiainducing factor (HIF)-1a in human glioblastoma multiforme cells. PDK1 is a HIF-1–regulated gene and our
ﬁndings indicated that hypoxia-induced PDK1 expression may promote EGFR activation, initiating a feedforward loop that can sustain malignant progression. RNAi-mediated attenuation of PDK1 and EGFR lowered
PDK1-EGFR activation and decreased HIF-1a expression, shifting the Warburg phenotype to OXPHOS and
inhibiting glioblastoma multiforme growth and proliferation. In clinical specimens of glioblastoma multiforme,
we found that immunohistochemical expression of PDK1, EGFR, and HIF-1a were elevated in glioblastoma
multiforme specimens when compared with normal brain tissues. Collectively, our studies establish PDK1 as a key
driver and candidate therapeutic target in glioblastoma multiforme. Cancer Res; 73(24); 7277–89. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Glioblastoma multiforme is a metabolically active, primary
adult brain tumor that evades multimodal therapy, leading to
short survival times. Patients with glioblastoma multiforme
have poor prognosis despite surgery and adjuvant chemoradiation with the majority dying within two years. This is
commonly attributed to the diverse and heterogeneous signaling mechanisms present in glioblastoma multiforme that
overcome pharmacotherapy. On the contrary, pervasive metabolic signatures have been identiﬁed, particularly the dependence upon glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS) with elevated lactate production regardless of
oxygen availability. This bioenergetic state, when associated
with increased glucose metabolism, results in tumorigenesis
and tumor progression and a phenomenon termed the Warburg effect (1–6). The end result is such that despite functionally complex pathways, convergence occurs to some degree at
the mitochondrial level. These metabolically active pathways

in tumor cells are regulated by an upstream cascade of
signaling mechanisms involving known growth factor receptor
tyrosine kinases (RTK) implicated in tumorigenesis and in
regulating glucose homeostasis (7, 8). Aberrant receptor kinase
signaling is the primary mode contributing to malignant
phenotypes with deﬁned oncogenic signatures in human cancers, including glioblastoma multiforme. We propose that the
ubiquitous EGFR activation observed in glioblastoma multiforme is associated with dysregulated metabolic responses and
cell proliferation, making it an ideal target for therapy. However, clinical trials targeting EGFR alone using RTK inhibitors
have been met with failure, emphasizing the fact that downstream pathways may serve as the primary modulator of tumor
behavior.
Several studies have reported that pyruvate dehydrogenase
along with its inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK),
a gatekeeper of glucose oxidation, can be targeted for regulating glucose oxidation and OXPHOS (9, 10). Interestingly,
PDK1 is involved in cancer cell–associated glycolysis and
mitochondrial dysfunction (11, 12). In this report, we demonstrated that oncogenic tyrosine kinases, when activated,
orchestrate oncogenic signals to the mitochondria to activate
PDK1, thereby promoting cancer cell metabolism and tumor
growth. Although our knowledge of upstream signaling events
in glioblastoma multiforme tumorigenesis has increased in
recent years, the mechanisms and metabolic changes contributing to the aggressive nature of these tumors remain elusive.
We further hypothesize that identiﬁcation of EGFR–protein
complexes regulating cell metabolism with which EGFR
associates are critical for understanding control of cellular

proliferation, growth, and survival. Here, we present evidence
of the functional signiﬁcance and interaction of EGFR with
mitochondrial PDK1. This mitochondrial interaction was
found to be diminished after treatment with their respective
inhibitors, silencing, or using human umbilical cord blood
stem cells (hUCBSC). Similarly, we found evidence that dichloroacetate (DCA), a speciﬁc inhibitor of PDK1 (13), reduced
EGFR phosphorylation and thereby reduced the EGFR-induced
tumor growth.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and plasmids
EGFR, pEGFR, PDK1, GFP, COX-2, caspase-3, caspase-9,
cytochrome c, SMAC, and GAPDH antibodies were purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology along with erlotinib hydrochloride, geﬁtinib hydrochloride. HIF-1a was purchased from
Abcam; PDK inhibitor DCA and Cobalt Chloride were from
Sigma; si-RNA constructs for PDK1 and PDK4 knockdown were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. The short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) construct for EGFR was discussed previously (14). Plasmid over-expressing EGFR (Cat# 32751) and
HIF-1a (Cat#18955) were obtained from Addgene. L-Lactate
assay kit (Cat# 1200011002) was obtained from Eton Biosciences. Trans-AM HIF-1 kit (47596) was purchased from
Active Motif. Isolation of intact mitochondria from cultured
glioblastoma multiforme cells and surgical biopsies was
performed using Mitochondria Isolation Kit (Pierce
Biotechnology).
Cell culture
U251 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection and were grown in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle
Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone) and
1% penicillin–streptomycin (Invitrogen). U251 cell lines were
tested and authenticated according to the providers' instructions. Xenograft cell line 5310 (a kind gift from Dr. David James
at the University of California, San Francisco, CA), authenticated as described previously (15) was grown in RPMI-1640
medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin at 37 C.
Preparation and culture of hUCBSCs
Human umbilical cord blood samples were collected from
the umbilical vein of newborns with informed maternal consent according to the protocol approved by the Institutional
Review Board at the University of Illinois College of Medicine at
Peoria (Peoria, IL). hUCBSC harvests were processed within 24
hours of collection, with viability of more than 90%. Isolation,
culture, and expansion of hUCBSCs were performed as
described previously (14).
Quantitative real-time PCR
The mRNA expression levels of EGFR and PDK1 were
detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) using the
iCycler iQ (Bio-Rad) in the cDNA isolated from the hGBM
biopsies using the primer sequences listed in Supplementary
Table S1. The fold changes obtained are normalized to the

normal brain control. Each sample was run in triplicate for the
target gene and the internal control gene GAPDH.
Western blot analysis, immunoprecipitation, and
immunoﬂuorescence labeling
Proteins extracted from cultured cells and tissue lysates was
followed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with
corresponding antibodies, as described previously (14). Densitometry quantitation was determined using the Image J
software (NIH, Bethesda, MD). Equal loading was conﬁrmed
by stripping and reprobing the membranes with GAPDH/
COX2 antibodies. For immunoﬂuorescence analysis, cells were
ﬁxed and incubated with primary antibodies, Alexa Fluor dyeconjugated secondary antibodies, and 40 , 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) according to standard protocols (14). Cells
were examined using Olympus BX61 confocal microscope with
a 60-Å oil immersion objective. SPOT basic and SPOT advanced
software was used to deconvolute Olympus BX61 images
(Diagnostic Instruments).
Immunohistochemistry of hGBM specimens and in vivo
tissue sections
hGBM surgical biopsy specimens were obtained from Saint
Francis Medical Center (Peoria, IL) and processed in accordance with the UICOMP Institutional Review Board–approved
protocols. Serial sections of six human specimens (normal
human brain, hGBM-1, hGBM-2, hGBM-3, hGBM-4, and
hGBM-5) and mouse xenograft tissue sections were stained
with the EGFR, PDK1, HIF-1a, and COX2 antibodies as
described previously (14). Images were acquired by using an
Olympus BX61 ﬂuorescence microscope and processed using
SPOT advance software.
Transfections and generation of stable cell lines
Cells were plated at a density of 4  105/60 mm dish 18 hours
before transfection. Transfection was carried out using XtremeGENE (Roche) reagents according to the vendor's
instructions. Transfected cultures were selected with G418
(400 mg mL1) for 10 to 14 days. At that time, antibioticresistant colonies were picked, pooled, and expanded for
further analysis under selective conditions.
L-Lactate

assay from cell culture media and tissue
extracts
To measure lactate contents, cells and tissues were
extracted with cold 80% ethanol (tissue/solvent ratio 1:8) and
centrifuged at 10,000  g at 4 C for 30 minutes. The supernatants were collected and diluted with water at different
dilutions. The lactate contents were then assayed using the
lactate assay kit (Eton Bioscience).
HIF-1a transcription activity assay
HIF-1a transcriptional activity was analyzed by using
TransAM HIF-1 Transcription Factor Assay Kit (Active Motif)
following manufacturer's instructions. Brieﬂy, nuclear extracts
were added onto a 96-well microplate coated with oligonucleotides containing hypoxia response element (59-TACGTGCT39) from the erythropoietin (EPO) gene. HIF dimers present in

and the tumor volume (mm3) of control, Fl-EFGR, or FlEFGRþDCA–treated 5310 cells were compared.

Mitochondria isolation and subcellular fractionation
Mitochondrial extracts were prepared using a kit (Pierce;
Cat# 89801). Tissues, around 50 to 200 mg, subjected to
fractionation were washed with 2 to 4 mL of PBS and were
then cut into small pieces for trypsin treatment, followed by a
series of centrifugations to obtain cytosolic and mitochondrial
fractions. Mitochondrial proteins (60 mg) and cytosolic proteins (30 mg) were analyzed by immunoblotting analyses. COX2
(cytochrome c oxidase subunit II) and GAPDH were used as
respective loading controls.

Intracranial injections
Fl-EGFR-5310 cells (5  105) were injected intracranially into
four mice per group on the right side of 4-week-old female
athymic nude mice under isoﬂuorane anesthesia with the aid
of a stereotactic frame. The calvarium of each anesthetized
mouse was exposed through a midline incision and a burr hole
was drilled 1 mm lateral (right) and 2 mm anterior to the
bregma. Two weeks after tumor implantation, the mice were
intravenously injected with 100 mg/kg body weight of DCA.
Following tumor cell injection and treatments, mice were
observed daily until they reached a moribund state, at which
time they were euthanized and their brains removed and
processed for histopathologic analysis. All experiments were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
of the University of Illinois College of Medicine at Peoria.

Hypoxia and other treatments
U251 and 5310 cells were exposed to 1 to 3 cycles of hypoxia
and normoxia. Each hypoxic cycle consisted of a period of 24
hours in 1% oxygen followed by 24-hour recovery under
normoxic conditions. During this reoxygenation period, cells
were provided with fresh medium. In another experiment,
hypoxic conditions were obtained by incubating cells in 150
mmol/L CoCl2 at different time points as described previously
(16). In another experiment, U251 and 5310 cells were treated
with either 5 mmol/L erlotinib or geﬁtinib hydrochloride for 9
hours; 1 mmol/L DCA for 1 hour.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis and graphical presentation was done using
quantitative data from Western blot analysis and other assays
were evaluated for statistical signiﬁcance using GraphPad Prism
4.0. Data for each treatment group were represented as means 
SEM and compared with other groups for signiﬁcance by oneway ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc test (multiple
comparison tests) using GraphPad Prism version 3.02. Results
presented in this study are the representative images of three
independent experiments (n ¼ 3) and results are expressed as
mean  SE ( , P < 0.05;  , P < 0.01;  , P < 0.001).

MTT and TUNEL assay
Cell growth from exponentially growing U251 and 5310 cells;
and their respective treatments including si-PDK1, sh-EGFR,
DCA (1 mmol/L), Fl-EGFR (full-length EGFR), Fl-EGFRþDCA,
Fl-EGFRþsiPDK1 was measured using the MTT assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen).
To evaluate cell death, TUNEL assay was performed in both
U251 and 5310 cells treated with si-PDK1 following manufactures instructions (Roche).
EGFR phosphorylation antibody array
Around 500 mg of total cell lysates from the 5310- control
and treated cells were subjected to EGFR phosphorylation
antibody array (Ray Biotech) by following the manufacturer's
instructions.
Subcutaneous tumors
Female nude mice of 6- to 8-week-old (Harlan Labs) were
subcutaneously injected on the right ﬂanks with 1  106 FlEGFR-5310 cells. Tumor formation was assessed every 4 to 5
days. Tumor growth was recorded by measuring two perpendicular diameters of the tumors over a 5-week time course
using the formula 4p/3  (width/2)  (length/2). Dicholoroacetate (DCA), an inhibitor for PDK1 was injected on the
site of tumor at a concentration of 100 mg/kg body weight on
the 13th and 15th day after tumor implantation. The tumors
were harvested and weighed at the experimental endpoint

Results
EGFR and PDK1 coexpress in surgical biopsies of
glioblastoma multiforme patients
Activation of EGFR in glioblastoma multiforme earlier has
shown to increase glucose uptake and lactate production
through NF-kB–dependent signaling cascade, promoting
tumor development (17). Studies conducted on aberrant
FGFR1 revealed its common existence in tumors regulating
the Warburg effect (18). Recent studies revealed that targeting
PDK by DCA shifts cancer cell metabolism from glycolysis
to OXPHOS by dephosphorylating mitochondrial pyruvate
dehydrogenase (13). Furthermore, to better understand how
tyrosine kinase signaling in conjunction with PDK1 regulates
the Warburg effect, we ﬁrst analyzed the expression of EGFR
and PDK1 in ﬁve different human glioblastoma multiforme
(hGBM) surgical specimens along with the normal brain.
Interestingly, hGBMs 1, 3, and 4 showed high levels of EGFR
and PDK1, whereas hGBMs 2 and 5 showed moderate expression when compared with the normal brain. Consistent with
these results, immunohistochemical analysis of all the hGBMs
showed similar increased levels of pEGFR and PDK1. However,
reduced EGFR, pEGFR, and PDK1 levels were observed in
normal control brain sections (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig.
S1). The hGBM specimens were then tested for EGFR and PDK1
mRNA expression by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and were
shown to express the increased transcripts when compared

with the normal brain (Fig. 1B). Similarly, Western blot analysis
conﬁrmed our immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR ﬁndings
(Fig. 1C). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation (IP) studies using
PDK1 antibody demonstrated pEGFR expression in hGBMs 1,
2, 4 and 5; whereas using pEGFR antibody, we observed PDK1
expression in all the hGBM specimens tested in the present
study. Of note is the normal brain, which showed no or minimal
expression in both experimental conditions (Fig. 1D). These
observations show a novel link between EGFR and PDK1
signaling and suggest that this association might play a critical
role in regulating glioma cell metabolism.
DCA treatment and silencing of PDK1 suppresses EGFR
expression in glioblastoma multiforme
Previously, we demonstrated the effectiveness of antiEGFR–targeted therapy using EGFR inhibitors such as

7280

Cancer Res; 73(24) December 15, 2013

erlotinib, geﬁtinib, and AG1478 (14). Therefore, we sought
to investigate the efﬁcacy of these drugs against the gatekeeper of glycolysis, PDK1. Both geﬁtinib and erlotinib were
able to effectively suppress PDK1 and EGFR. However,
erlotinib treatment was observed to suppress them more
effectively. (Fig. 2A and B). We extended our study by
engineering glioma cell lines, U251 and 5310, to stably
express either Fl-EGFR (3639 bp) or stably knockdown EGFR
(sh-EGFR) by transfection. sh-EGFR–treated U251 and 5310
cells showed reduced expression levels of EGFR, pEGFR, and
PDK1, whereas Fl-EGFR-U251 and 5310 cells demonstrated
increased levels of EGFR, pEGFR, and PDK1 (Fig. 2C–F). To
consolidate our hypothesis regarding EGFR and PDK1 crosstalk, we next examined whether PDK inhibitors also regulate
EGFR expression. We treated U251 and 5310 cells with 1
mmol/L DCA for 1 hour and observed that DCA treatment

PDK1 Suppresses EGFR-Mediated Glioma Metabolism

Figure 2. RTK inhibitors, sh-EGFR, DCA, and si-PDK1 reduce EGFR/PDK1 cross activation in U251 and 5310 cells. A, U251 and 5310 cells were grown
in serum-starved medium containing 5 mmol/L erlotinib or geﬁtinib for 9 hours. Cell lysates were evaluated for the expression levels of total and phosphorylated
EGFR and PDK1. B, quantitative estimation of A. C, downregulation of EGFR by an EGFR-speciﬁc shRNA resulted in loss of PDK1 expression in
both U251 and 5310 cells when transfected for 72 hours. Corresponding whole-cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-pEGFR, anti-EGFR, and anti-PDK1
antibodies. GAPDH served as a loading control (pSV, plasmid for scrambled vector). D, quantitative estimation of C. E, Fl-EGFR stable cells of U251
and 5310 were immunoblotted with anti-EGFR, anti-pEGFR, and anti-PDK1 antibodies, showing a marked increase in expression of these proteins in
the Fl-EGFR stable cells. F, quantitative estimation of E. G, U251 and 5310 cells were grown in serum-starved medium containing 1 mmol/L DCA for 1 hour.
Western blot analysis of these cell lysates showed the expression levels of total and phosphorylated EGFR as well as PDK1. H, quantitative estimation
of G. I and K, downregulation by PDK-speciﬁc siRNAs (PDK1 and PDK4) resulted in a pronounced decrease in EGFR and pEGFR expression in U251 and 5310
cells following 72 hours of transfection. PDK1 shRNA resulted in a more pronounced decrease in EGFR and pEGFR expression. J and L, quantitative
estimation of I and K, respectively. Results from three independent experiments are shown as mean  SE ( , P < 0.05;   , P < 0.01;   , P < 0.001).

reduced the expression levels of both EGFR and PDK1 (Fig.
2G and H). Furthermore, to verify if PDK1 silencing exerts
similar effects as evidenced by DCA, we transfected U251
and 5310 cells with si-PDK1, which signiﬁcantly inhibited
( , P < 0.01) the expression of both total and phosphorylated
forms of EGFR (Fig. 2I and J). To ensure that the inhibition of
EGFR with si-PDK1 is not an off target effect, we transfected
glioma cells with si-PDK4 and surprisingly observed a minimal reduction of EGFR and pEGFR (Fig. 2K and L). These
results showed that in glioblastoma multiforme cells, DCA or
silencing of PDK1, exhibited a comparable response to
erlotinib, geﬁtinib or sh-EGFR treatments.

Hypoxia mediates EGFR and PDK1 interaction in
mitochondria
It was earlier identiﬁed that the gene encoding PDK1 is
induced by hypoxia and is a direct target of HIF-1 (19).
Furthermore, Franovic and colleagues reported a clinical
correlation between tumor hypoxia and EGFR expression,
resulting in tumor progression and poor clinical outcome
(20). In the present study, we exposed U251 and 5310 cells to
hypoxia (1% oxygen) or normoxia for 24, 48, and 72 hours. In
another experiment, we exposed U251 and 5310 to the hypoxia
mimicking compound, CoCl2 at a concentration of 150 mmol/L
for 3, 6, and 9 hours. Immunoblotting analysis was performed

to analyze the induction of HIF-1a in both experiments.
Increased HIF-1a levels were observed at 72 hours in U251
cells and 48 hours in 5310 cells in hypoxic conditions, whereas
in cells treated with CoCl2, HIF-1a expression maximized at 6
hours in both the cell lines (Fig. 3A). To determine the
involvement of HIF-1a in regulating EGFR and PDK1 signaling,
we immunoblotted HIF-1a against the cell lysates of si-PDK1,
Fl-HIF-1a, sh-EGFR, and Fl-EGFR. The si-PDK1 and sh-EGFR

treatments showed decreased HIF-1a expression, whereas a
substantial increase was noted in Fl-EGFR, Fl-HIF-1a- U251,
and 5310 cells (Fig. 3B). We next investigated whether EGFR
and PDK1 expression were regulated by HIF-1a by measuring
its activity in U251 and 5310 cells subjected to various treatments using ELISA-based Trans-AM HIF-1a kit (Active Motif).
Interestingly, increased HIF-1a activity was observed in FlEGFR cells, whereas activity was attenuated in si-PDK1 and

points. In another experiment, hypoxic conditions were induced using 150 mmol/L CoCl2. Increased HIF-1a expression was observed at 72 hours
for U251 cells and 48 hours for 5310 cells. For cells treated with CoCl2, both cell lines showed an increase at the time point of 6 hours. B, downregulation of both
PDK1 and EGFR using their respective shRNAs resulted in decreased expression of HIF-1a in U251 and 5310 cell lysates. Stably expressing Fl-EGFR
in both U251 and 5310 cells showed increased expression of HIF-1a as compared with the control. GAPDH served as the loading control. C, HIF-1a
activity was measured using TransAM HIF-1 Transcription Factor Assay Kit. Increased HIF-1a was noted with EGFR overexpressing cells, whereas
downregulation of both PDK1 and EGFR showed a decrease in HIF-1a activity. D, representative immunohistochemical staining of HIF-1a in human
glioblastoma multiforme patient specimens and normal brain. All ﬁve tissues showed a strong positivity of HIF-1a (bar, 100 mm). E, mitochondrial fractions of
U251 and 5310 cells were immunoblotted with anti-PDK1 and anti-pEGFR antibodies, with COX2 serving as the loading control. Results showed decreased
mitochondrial expression for siPDK1 and shEGFR treatments, whereas increased expression was noted for PDK1 and pEGFR in Fl-EGFR–treated cells.
These aforementioned samples were immunoprecipitated with pEGFR and immunoblotted against PDK1. The same blots were stripped and reprobed with
anti-pEGFR antibody. F, dual immunohistochemical staining for colocalization was conducted on the control brain and hGBM specimens with
anti-PDK1, anti-pEGFR, and anti-COX2 antibodies followed by the secondary antibodies conjugated with ﬂuorophores for red (PDK1), green (pEGFR), and
blue (COX2) ﬂuorescence, respectively. Representative merged images show the cells expressing PDK1, pEGFR, and COX2 (bar, 100 mm). G, furthermore, we
carried out immunocytochemistry on normoxic and 48-hour–induced hypoxic-treated U251 and 5310 cells to study the expression of PDK1-pEGFR. PDK1 is
conjugated with Alexa Fluor-594 (red), pEGFR was conjugated with Alexa Flour-488 (green), and COX2 is conjugated with Alexa-Flour-647 (blue; bar, 200 mm).
All experiments were performed in triplicate (n ¼ 3). Results from three independent experiments are shown as mean  SE ( , P < 0.05;   , P < 0.01).

PDK1 Suppresses EGFR-Mediated Glioma Metabolism

sh-EGFR cells when compared with their respective controls.
These results demonstrated a positive feed-forward loop
between HIF-1a, PDK1, and EGFR (Fig. 3C). It is understood
that a majority of glioblastoma multiforme tumors are hypoxic
and that this hypoxic setting induces HIF expression in glioblastoma multiforme- cell lines and primary cultures (21, 22).
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed abundant expression
of HIF-1a in ﬁve hGBM specimens used in this study compared
with the normal brain control (Fig. 3D), suggesting that HIF-1a
expression plausibly controls the RTK coupled glioma metabolic pathway. Furthermore, PDK1 is listed as one of the HIFregulated mitochondrial target genes that mediate functional
changes observed in hypoxia (23). In addition, we conducted
immunoblot analysis on the mitochondrial isolates and
observed reduced mitochondrial levels of PDK1 and pEGFR

in si-PDK1, sh-EGFR–treated U251 and 5310 cells, whereas
increased levels were observed in Fl-EGFR–treated cells compared with their respective controls. To further conﬁrm PDK1
association with EGFR in the mitochondria, we conducted
immunoprecipitation analysis on the mitochondrial lysates
obtained from the aforementioned treatments using pEGFR
antibody. We observed increased pEGFR-PDK1 interaction in
Fl-EGFR treatments, whereas si-PDK1 and sh-EGFR treatments showed a suppressed interaction (Fig. 3E). To verify
the existence of pEGFR-PDK1 interaction in the mitochondria
in hGBM specimens, we performed immunocolocalization
studies with PDK1, pEGFR, and COX2 antibodies. We recorded
a signiﬁcant pEGFR(Green)-PDK1(Red)-COX2(Blue) interaction in ﬁve hGBM specimens as indicated in white, when
compared with the normal counterpart (Fig. 3F), highlighting

PDK1/pEGFR complex using appropriate secondary antibodies. Each experiment was performed in duplicate with each sample (n ¼ 2). PDK1 (red) and

the fact that targeting this interaction occurring at the mitochondria might be effective in modulating cell metabolism.
Finally, we examined the role of hypoxia in EGFR and PDK1
mitochondrial interaction by immunoﬂuorescence analysis on
48-hour–induced hypoxic samples. Increased pEGFR and
PDK1 mitochondrial localization was observed in both U251
and 5310 hypoxic cells, when compared with their respective
normoxic controls (Fig. 3G). In both the experiments (Fig. 3F
and G and Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B), we used COX2 to
identify mitochondria. These data provide evidence that
EGFR–PDK1 interaction at the mitochondria is upregulated
under hypoxia, uncovering a previously uncharacterized mechanism of HIF1-EGFR-PDK1 activation in both glioblastoma
multiforme cell lines and patient specimens.
Stem cell treatment inhibits EGFR-PDK1 interaction
in vivo
Previously, we showed that hUCBSCs reduced EGFR translocation to the mitochondria in glioblastoma multiforme cells,
highlighting the existence of hUCBSC-mediated antagonism of
EGFR in mitochondria (24). In light of our ﬁndings that EGFR
colocalizes with mitochondrial PDK1 (Fig. 3F and G), we asked
whether hUCBSC could regulate their localization. To study
this further, we conducted immunohistochemical analysis on
mice brain tissue sections of control and hUCBSC-treated
U251 and 5310 cells. Interestingly, we observed a great degree
of pEGFR-PDK1 localization on COX2 in both U251 and
5310 control sections, indicating the interaction, whereas
hUCBSC treatment reduced pEGFR–PDK1 interaction
(Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S3), suggesting that this
interaction might be required to modulate PDK1-EGFR–
mediated cell metabolism. Furthermore, Western blotting
conducted on the in vivo U251 and 5310 controls and their
respective treatments with hUCBSC revealed a marked
decrease in the individual expression levels of PDK1, EGFR,
and pEGFR. However, minimal expression of pEGFR and
PDK1 was observed in hUCBSC controls (Fig. 4B and C). We
next fractionated control and hUCBSC-treated tissues of
U251 and 5310 to investigate the expression of PDK1 and
EGFR. hUCBSC treatment reduced both the mitochondrial
(Fig. 4D and E) and cytoplasmic levels of (Fig. 4F and G)
EGFR, pEGFR, and PDK1when compared with the controls,
thereby suggesting that hUCBSC treatment may be effective
in regulating cancer cell metabolism by reducing the expression of signature molecules PDK1 and EGFR and their
mitochondrial association.
si-PDK1 induces apoptosis, decreases cell proliferation
and lactate release in glioblastoma multiforme
Several articles suggested that targeting metabolically
important key enzymes such as pyruvate dehydrogenase
kinase (9), lactate dehydrogenase (9, 25), or pyruvate kinase
(26), increase apoptosis and decrease proliferation and tumor
growth. Similarly, our Western blot analysis conducted on cell
lysates obtained from si-PDK1–treated U251 and 5310 cells
probed with caspase-3, caspase-9, cytochrome c, and SMAC
showed their increased expression (Fig. 5A) compared with
their respective controls, suggesting the induction of apopto-

sis. In addition, apoptosis in response to si-PDK1 treatment
showed 75% and 82% TUNEL positivity in U251 and 5310 cells
respectively, when compared with the controls (Fig. 5B). We
next sought to study whether si-PDK1 contributed to deregulated cell survival using a MTT assay. U251 and 5310 cells were
stimulated with si-PDK1, sh-EGFR, 1 mmol/L DCA, Fl-EGFR,
Fl-EGFRþDCA, and Fl-EGFRþsi-PDK1. Reduced proliferation
was observed in si-PDK1, DCA, and sh-EGFR–treated U251 and
5310 cells; however, cells stimulated with Fl-EGFR demonstrated increased proliferation. Notably, both si-PDK1 and
DCA treatments were effective in reducing the cell proliferation in U251 and 5310 cells expressing Fl-EGFR (Fig. 5C). We
further examined potential metabolic changes initiated by siPDK1 treatments in U251 and 5310 cells. Both the control
glioblastoma multiforme cells showed increased aerobic glycolysis as indicated by increased lactate production; however,
si-PDK1, sh-EGFR, and DCA treatments maximally reduced
the production of lactate. Conversely, Fl-EGFR treatment
increased the lactate production, indicating that EGFR overexpression facilitated the induction of aerobic glycolysis.
Reduced lactate release in the Fl-EGFR cells exposed to DCA
underscores that silencing PDK1 targeting EGFR might effectively reduce lactate production, mitigating cells towards
oxidative phosphorylation (Fig. 5D). Similarly, hUCBSC treatment reduced lactate release in treated extracts compared
with their respective controls. Interestingly, hUCBSC control
samples alone showed minimal lactate production (Fig. 5E).
Experiments conducted using hGBM samples showed a relative abundance of lactate compared with the normal brain (Fig.
5F), indicating that a greater portion of lactate was derived
through glycolysis. Taken together, our data show that si-PDK1
not only induced apoptosis, but also reduced EGFR-mediated
cell proliferation and lactate production in glioblastoma
multiforme.
DCA treatment abrogates EGFR phosphorylation and
suppresses the tumorigenic ability of glioblastoma
multiforme cells in vivo
Reduced levels of EGFR in si-PDK1- or DCA-treated U251
and 5310 cells prompted us to further study the associated
mechanism by using an EGFR phosphorylation antibody array.
We subjected 5310- control, Fl-EGFR, and Fl-EGFR þ 1 mmol/L
DCA for analysis. EGFR phosphorylation array revealed substantial inhibition of EGFR(Tyr845) by 75%, EGFR (Tyr1045) by
50%, EGFR (Tyr1086) by 90%, EGFR (Tyr1148; Tyr1173) by 60%,
EGFR (Ser1046/1047; Ser1070) by 50.2%, 48.8%, ErbB2
(Tyr1112) by 82.4%, ErbB2 (Tyr1221/1222) by 40.4%, ErbB2
(Ser1113) by 50.33%, and ErbB3 (Tyr1289) by 68.9% in DCAtreated Fl-EGFR 5310 cells, thus conﬁrming the existence of
functional cooperativity and interaction between these proteins (Fig. 6A). Having demonstrated that a diminution of
EGFR by DCA treatment had substantial in vitro effects, we
next sought to determine its effects on in vivo behavior. We ﬁrst
implanted the Fl-EGFR-5310 cells into the right ﬂanks of
athymic nude mice. The data in Fig. 6B show that cells from
Fl-EGFR-5310 cells formed tumors with increased kinetics,
whereas tumor growth was remarkably suppressed when
the same numbers of cells injected were treated with two

PDK1 Suppresses EGFR-Mediated Glioma Metabolism

Discussion
Cell metabolism in cancer is a diverse network of dynamic
pathways utilized by the cells to synthesize and obtain energy
for an altered "cellular goal"- one that represents exponential
growth rather than homeostatic mechanisms. To support
growth and proliferation, cancer cells have to signiﬁcantly
transform cellular metabolism by deregulating the expression
of several key proteins. A well-known oncogenic metabolic
signature in glioblastoma multiforme is increased glycolysis
despite the presence of oxygen, termed the Warburg effect.
Several important oncogenes involved in the progression of
common human cancers including glioblastoma multiforme,
have been found to be involved in the regulation of glycolysis.
For example, Yang and colleagues showed an important mechanistic interplay between the EGFR and NF-kB pathways in
cancer metabolism during tumor development (17). Hitosugi
and colleagues reported that oncogenic tyrosine kinases such
as FGFR1, localized in the cancer cell mitochondria, phosphorylate and activated mitochondrial PDK1 to promote cancer cell
metabolism and tumor progression (18). Typically, EGFR
shares extensive sequence homology with other receptor tyrosine kinase subfamilies such as FGFR, VEGFR, and PDGFR, and
clinical studies with speciﬁc EGFR inhibitors such as geﬁtinib
and erlotinib revealed that FGFR can also be targeted to
patients with lung cancer bearing active FGFR signaling pathways (27). In view of these ﬁndings, we hypothesized that EGFR
phosphorylation might interact and activate PDK1 in glioblastoma multiforme. Our ﬁndings therefore emphasize the importance of studying the mechanisms linking EGFR with other
potential targets, eventually translating to novel treatment
strategies.
In high necrotic core areas in any given tumor, the
amount of oxygen observed is extremely low, thereby accelerating the cells to adapt to hypoxia mediated by HIF-1
stabilization. Furthermore, HIF-1 is known to transcribe and
express several glycolytic genes that critically regulate cell
death and apoptosis including PDK1 and EGFR (20, 28, 29).
In this study, we conﬁrmed that both PDK1 and EGFR
expression were signiﬁcantly correlated with HIF-1a expression in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. As PDK1 and
EGFR reside in different subcellular compartments, we
questioned their location of intracellular interaction. PDK1
is known to function in the mitochondria and a few studies
have already conﬁrmed that EGFR translocates to the mitochondria (24, 30). To begin addressing this question, we
conducted immunoﬂuorescence studies and found that
PDK1 colocalizes with EGFR in the mitochondrial matrix.
Our question whether hypoxia meditated by HIF-1a activation affects EGFR-PDK1 localization was addressed by
observing increased EGFR–PDK1–COX2 interaction in hypoxic conditions, when compared with decreased or minimal
interaction in normoxic conditions, suggesting that hypoxia
meditated by HIF-1a stabilization may be required for PDK1
and EGFR interaction (Fig. 5G). Although this mechanism
appears speculative, PDK1-EGFR interaction might provide
starting points in targeting glioma cell metabolism.
Furthermore, after examining the expression of EGFR and
PDK1 involved in human glioblastoma multiforme glycolytic

www.aacrjournals.org

pathway, we then evaluated potential therapeutic modalities
by correlating in vivo prognosis with in vitro test results. We
have earlier reported that stem cells derived from human
umbilical cord blood can be effectively used as an alternative
therapy in targeting glioblastoma multiforme (14). Here,
immunohistochemical analysis revealed that hUCBSC treatment reduced EGFR-PDK1 interaction and subcellular fraction experiments and further showed that hUCBSC effectively reduced EGFR and PDK1 expression, both at the
mitochondrial and the cytoplasmic levels. Further studies
are warranted to determine how hUCBSC functionally regulates cancer cell metabolism. We also were able to demonstrate that silencing of PDK1 exhibited apoptotic and
anti-proliferative effects on U251 and 5310 cells. Our results
presented in this study correlated with previous reports
regarding the effect of DCA (31). In addition, both si-PDK1
and DCA treatments suppressed lactate production in U251
and 5310 cell lines, and sh-EGFR treatment also demonstrated similar results. Conversely, hGBM tissues demonstrated a great fold of lactate production conﬁrming the
occurrence of typical metabolic remodeling reﬂective of the
Warburg effect. Collectively, the effect of siPDK1, DCA, and
sh-EGFR treatment shifted U251 and 5310 glioma cell
metabolism towards oxidative phosphorylation. Preliminary
data supporting the use of DCA in glioblastoma multiforme
begs further analysis, particularly with regard to ubiquitous
EGFR-mediated growth mechanisms. Here, we sought to
verify whether DCA treatment reduces EGFR–PDK1 interaction, although previous reports substantiate its activity
against PDKII in glioblastoma multiforme (18).
Our observations with DCA suggested that inhibition of
either PDK1 or EGFR or both may affect cancer cell metabolism in vitro. These ﬁndings compelled us to explore the
existence of an uncovered mechanism by which PDK1 regulates EGFR and its activity. To explain this, we used an EGFR
phosphorylation antibody array. It was interesting to ﬁnd that
DCA-treated 5310-EGFR expressing cells demonstrated a
reduced expression of multiple EGFR phosphorylation sites,
including Tyr845, suggesting that 5310-EGFR expressing cells
might in part rely on PDK1 expression for EGFR phosphorylation. In contrast, 5310 cells alone demonstrated basal EGFR
phosphorylation levels. Earlier ﬁndings by Demory and colleagues that phosphorylation of EGFR at Tyr845 is essential for
mitochondrial translocation (29), provides strong support to
our conclusions regarding reduced EGFR phosphorylation
with DCA treatment. Further evidence substantiates that DCA
treatment decreased tumor growth in some xenograft models
(13, 32, 33) and in human patients (34). In the present study, we
generated a subcutaneous and intracranial tumor model by
injecting 5310-Fl-EGFR cells. DCA treatment reduced the
EGFR-induced subcutaneous tumor by 60% and intracranial
tumor by 80%. Our current ﬁndings reveal for the ﬁrst time that
DCA treatment reduces EGFR-induced glioblastoma tumor
growth, highlighting the distinct functions of PDK1/DCA
relative to tumor development. The illustrated mitochondrial
functions of EGFR, its role in regulating mechanisms for
glioblastoma metabolism, and its interaction with PDK1 provide important insights into glioblastoma tumor progression

and targets for treating glioblastoma. In summary, our work
suggests that PDK1 may serve as a novel therapeutic target in
treating glioblastoma along with EGFR. Targeting this protein
complex may result in further treatment avenues in the
metabolic modulation of glioblastoma.
