Abstract
Development and progression of cancer is accompanied by
marked changes in the expression and activity of enzymes
involved in the cellular homeostasis of fatty acids. One class of
enzymes that play a particularly important role in this process
are the acetyl-CoA carboxylases (ACC). ACCs produce malonylCoA, an intermediate metabolite that functions as substrate
for fatty acid synthesis and as negative regulator of fatty acid
oxidation. Here, using the potent ACC inhibitor soraphen A, a
macrocyclic polyketide from myxobacteria, we show that ACC
activity in cancer cells is essential for proliferation and
survival. Even at nanomolar concentrations, soraphen A can
block fatty acid synthesis and stimulate fatty acid oxidation
in LNCaP and PC-3M prostate cancer cells. As a result, the
phospholipid content of cancer cells decreased, and cells
stopped proliferating and ultimately died. LNCaP cells predominantly died through apoptosis, whereas PC-3M cells
showed signs of autophagy. Supplementation of the culture
medium with exogenous palmitic acid completely abolished
the effects of soraphen A and rescued the cells from cell death.
Interestingly, when added to cultures of premalignant BPH-1
cells, soraphen A only slightly affected cell proliferation and
did not induce cell death. Together, these findings indicate
that cancer cells have become dependent on ACC activity to
provide the cell with a sufficient supply of fatty acids to permit
proliferation and survival, introducing the concept of using
small-molecule ACC inhibitors as therapeutic agents for
cancer. [Cancer Res 2007;67(17):8180–7]

Introduction
Development and progression of cancer is typically accompanied
by changes in the expression and activation of proteins involved in
the synthesis, transport, and metabolism of fatty acids (1, 2). The
protein that has been studied most extensively in this respect is
fatty acid synthase (FASN), the enzyme that catalyzes all terminal
steps in the synthesis of saturated long-chain fatty acids (3).
Overexpression of this enzyme is found already in the earliest
stages of tumor development and becomes more pronounced as
the tumor progresses (4–7). To gain more insight into the role of
FASN overexpression in cancer cells and to explore its potential as
a target for antineoplastic intervention, several chemical compounds, including cerulenin, c75, and Orlistat, were used as FASN
inhibitor (8–15). Although these inhibitors are not monospecific

and are effective only at micromolar concentrations, inhibition of
FASN invariably resulted in growth arrest and induced cell death
selectively in cancer cells (8–15). Similar observations were made
when FASN was down-regulated by RNA interference (16).
Another class of enzymes that play a key role in the cellular
homeostasis of fatty acids are the acetyl-CoA carboxylases (ACC).
ACCs are biotin-containing enzymes that catalyze the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA. In humans, there are two
ACC isoforms, ACC1 (M r = 265,000) and ACC2 (M r = 280,000), that
are encoded by two separate genes (17). ACC1 is mainly cytosolic
and fuels the malonyl-CoA pool that is used as C2-unit donor for
de novo synthesis of long-chain fatty acids by FASN and for
subsequent chain elongation. ACC2 is associated with the
mitochondria and regulates a second pool of malonyl-CoA that
governs fatty acid oxidation through inhibition of carnitine
palmitoyltransferase I, the enzyme that facilitates the entry of
long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria for h-oxidation (4, 18).
Both enzymes show a high degree of sequence homology and are
similarly regulated through a combination of transcriptional,
translational, and posttranslational mechanisms. In cancer cells,
both ACC isoforms have been shown to be overexpressed
coordinately with FASN (4, 5) and are activated downstream from
mutations in tumor suppressors, including LKB1 and BRCA1
(19–22). However, treatment of cancer cells with 5-(tetradecycloxy)2-furoic acid (TOFA), a classic inhibitor of ACC, did not affect cell
proliferation and failed to induce apoptosis (23, 24). Preincubation
of cells with TOFA even protected cells from FASN inhibitor–
induced cytotoxicity. On the basis of these data, it was concluded
that accumulation of malonyl-CoA is the main mediator of the
cytotoxic effects of FASN inhibition and ACC was abandoned as a
potential target for cancer intervention.
Recently, two studies have shown that silencing of ACC1 by
RNA interference causes growth inhibition and induces cell death
almost to the same extent as observed after silencing of FASN
gene expression (25, 26). These findings suggest that apart from
malonyl-CoA accumulation, inhibition of lipogenesis per se may
cause cancer cell death and that ACC may be a target for
antineoplastic therapy after all. However, up to now, no reports
have been published on the use of chemical ACC inhibitors to
block the proliferation of cancer cells, nor could in the ACC1
knockdown experiment the involvement of local increases in
malonyl-CoA levels (due to compensatory activation of ACC2)
be excluded.
Here, we report on the use of a highly potent ACC inhibitor
soraphen A. Soraphen A is a natural macrocyclic polyketide
originally isolated from the myxobacterium Sorangium cellulosum.
It displays potent antifungal activities that have been attributed to
its ability to bind to the biotin carboxylase domain dimer interface
of eukaryotic ACCs, thereby disrupting the oligomerization of the
enzyme and inhibiting its activity (27–32). Soraphen A has been
shown to inhibit also human ACCs in an isoform-nonselective

manner (31). We show that soraphen A, at nanomolar concentrations, blocks lipogenesis and enhances fatty acid oxidation in
prostate cancer cells. Cancer cells stop proliferating and ultimately
die. When soraphen A was added to cultures of premalignant cells,
no cytotoxic effects were observed. These findings suggest that
cancer cells have become dependent on ACC activity to provide the
cell with sufficient fatty acids to proliferate and survive. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first report to introduce the concept of
using ACC inhibitors as therapeutic agents for cancer.

Figure 1. Soraphen A decreases the ability of cancer cells to synthesize fatty
acids and increases fatty acid oxidation. A, cells were seeded in a 6-cm dish
at a density of 4  105 per dish (LNCaP) or 1  105 per dish (PC-3M, BPH-1).
The next day, cells were treated with soraphen A, as indicated, and etomoxir
(final concentration, 10 Ag/mL). After 20 h, cells were exposed to [2-14C]acetate
for 4 h. Cellular lipids were extracted and [2-14C]acetate incorporation was
measured by scintillation counting. Results are representative of three
independent experiments. Columns, means of triplicate measurements; bars,

indicated. After 24 h, [1-14C]palmitic acid was added for 6 h and the incorporation
of radiolabel into CO2 was measured. Results are representative of three

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and cell culture. LNCaP and BPH-1 cells, obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection, were maintained at 37jC in a humidified
incubator with a 5% CO2/95% air atmosphere in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 10% FCS (Invitrogen). For experiments on the effects of R1881 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) on LNCaP cells, cells were seeded in medium
supplemented with 5% charcoal-treated serum as described previously (33).
For routine maintenance of BPH-1 cells, 70 nmol/L testosterone and 1%
insulin-transferrin-selenium mixture (Invitrogen) was added to the culture
medium. PC-3M-luc-C6 cells ( further referred to as PC-3M) were obtained
from Xenogen Corporation and were maintained at 37jC in a 5% CO2/95%
air atmosphere in MEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% sodium pyruvate,
1% MEM vitamin solution, and 1% MEM nonessential amino acids
(Invitrogen). Nonmalignant human skin fibroblasts were cultured as
described previously (25). Soraphen A, purified from the myxobacterium
S. cellulosum, was provided by Drs. Klaus Gerth and Rolf Jansen (Hemholtz
Zentrum für Infektionsforschung GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany).
[2-14C]acetate incorporation assay and quantitation of lipid species.
Cells were seeded at a density of 4  105 per dish (LNCaP) or 1  105 per dish
(PC-3M and BPH-1) and treated with soraphen A or vehicle (ethanol) as
indicated. Etomoxir (Sigma Chemical) was added to a final concentration of
10 Ag/mL to prevent oxidation of fatty acids. Twenty hours after treatment,
[2-14C]acetate (57 mCi/mmol; 1 ACi/6-cm dish; Amersham International plc)
was added to the cultures. Four hours later, cells were washed with PBS,
scraped, and resuspended in 0.9 mL PBS (Invitrogen). Lipids were extracted
using the Bligh-Dyer method (33). 14C incorporation into lipids was measured
by scintillation counting and normalized for sample protein content. To
analyze 14C incorporation into different lipid classes, lipids were separated by
TLC and were quantitated using a Phosphor Imager screen (Molecular
Dynamics; ref. 33). Quantitation of phospholipids and free cholesterol was
carried out as described previously (34, 35).
Measurement of fatty acid oxidation. Cells were seeded at a density of
4  105 (LNCaP) or 1  105 (PC-3M and BPH-1) in T25 flasks and treated
with soraphen A as indicated. After 24 h, cells were incubated with
[1-14C]palmitic acid (54 mCi/mmol; 0.5 ACi/6-cm flask; Sigma), complexed
to fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA; see below). Flasks were made
airtight by using stopper tops. After 6 h, 200 AL KOH (10 N) was added with
a syringe to a center well containing a folded Whatman filter paper.
Subsequently, 1 mL of 12% perchloric acid was added to the medium
through the stopper tops using a syringe, without touching the cells, to
release the labeled CO2 from the medium. The flasks were placed for a
minimum of 1 h at 37jC to trap labeled CO2. Finally, the filter paper was
removed and transferred to a scintillation vial for radioactivity counting.
Proliferation/cytotoxicity assays and fluorescence-activated cell
sorting analysis. At the indicated time points after treatment, cells were
collected and cell number and viability were determined using a trypan blue
dye exclusion assay (14). For experiments on the mechanism of cell death,
50 Amol/L N-benzoyl-oxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (z-VADfmk; Sigma) or 10 mmol/L 3-methyladenine (Sigma) was added to the
culture medium of cells 24 h ( for z-VAD-fmk) or 48 h ( for 3-methyladenine)
after treatment with soraphen A or vehicle. Palmitic acid (Sigma) was
dissolved in ethanol at a final concentration of 5 mmol/L and complexed to
fatty acid-free BSA (Sigma) by adding 4 volumes of a 4% BSA solution in
0.9% NaCl to 1 volume of palmitic acid (5), and incubated at 37jC for 1 h to
obtain a 1 mmol/L stock solution of BSA-complexed palmitic acid. This
complex was added to the culture medium at a concentration of 75 Amol/L
and effects on cell death were examined by trypan blue staining. Cell
proliferation was also quantitated using the bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd)
labeling and detection kit III (Roche Diagnostics) at 72 h after treatment.
For fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, cells were trypsinized and fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol for 1 h, 96 h after treatment with
soraphen A. After fixation, cells were washed twice with PBS containing
0.05% Tween 20 and resuspended in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20,
0.5 mg/mL propidium iodide (Sigma), and 1 mg/mL RNase A (Sigma).
Analysis of samples was done using the CellQuest and Modfit software on a
FACSort cytometer (Becton Dickinson).

Detection of apoptosis. Cells were plated in 6-cm dishes and treated
with soraphen A as indicated. After 96 h, Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) was added
to the culture medium of living cells; fragmentation of the nucleus into
oligonucleosomes and chromatin condensation were detected by fluorescence microscopy using a filter for Hoechst 33342 (365 nm). Apoptosis was
also determined with an Annexin V–FITC/Propidium Iodide Apoptosis
detection kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The cells were washed and subsequently incubated with Annexin
V–FITC for 15 min at room temperature and counterstained with
propidium iodide ( final concentration 1 Ag/mL). Afterward, apoptosis
was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy using a dual-filter set for FITC
and propidium iodide.
Detection of autophagy. To study the formation of autophagic vacuoles,
the localization of LC3, a specific marker of autophagosomes, was
monitored. LC3 was expressed as an amino-terminal fusion with green
fluorescent protein (EGFP) using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) for LNCaP
cells and FuGene (Roche) for PC-3M cells. The plasmid encoding EGFP-LC3
was provided by Prof. Dr. Tamotsu Yoshimori (Department of Cell Genetics,
National Institute of Genetics, Shizuoka-ken, Japan; ref. 36). Cells were
subsequently treated with soraphen A or vehicle for 96 h. As a positive
control, cells were washed thrice with PBS and incubated with HBSS
(Invitrogen) for 6 h. Autophagy was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy
using a filter set for EGFP. Autophagic vacuoles were also visualized by
labeling with the fluorophore monodansylcadaverine (Sigma). Cells were
incubated with 0.05 mmol/L monodansylcadaverine in PBS at 37jC for
10 min before fixation using a 4% paraformaldehyde solution in PBS for
10 min at room temperature (37–39). Intracellular monodansylcadaverine
was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (excitation wavelength 380 nm,
emission filter 525 nm).

Immunoblotting. For Western blot analysis of the cleavage of poly(ADPribose) polymerase (PARP) or LC3, cells were seeded at a density of 4  105
(LNCaP) or 1  105 cells (PC-3M) per 6-cm dish and treated with soraphen
A or vehicle. After 96 h, cells were washed with PBS and lysed in a reducing
NuPage sample loading buffer (Invitrogen). As previously described (33),
equal amounts of protein were separated on NuPage gels (Invitrogen) and
processed for immunoblot analysis for cleaved PARP (Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc.) or LC3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), which recognizes
both the cytosolic LC3-I as well as the membrane-associated LC3-II form.
Equal loading of proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting for a-tubulin
(Cell Signaling Technology).
Statistics. Statistical analyses were done using one-way ANOVA with
Tukey’s multiple comparison test; P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant. All data are means F SE.

Results
Soraphen A decreases fatty acid synthesis and increases
fatty acid oxidation in prostate cell lines. LNCaP and PC-3M
prostate cancer cells and premalignant BPH-1 cells were treated with
increasing concentrations of soraphen A. Fatty acid synthesis was
measured by exposing the cells for 4 h to [2-14C]acetate after
pretreatment with etomoxir, an irreversible inhibitor of carnitine
O-palmitoyltransferase-1 (40) to block fatty acid oxidation. Cellular
lipids were extracted and the incorporation of [2-14C]acetate into
cellular lipids was measured using scintillation counting. Figure 1A
shows that in all cell lines, soraphen A treatment led to a dosedependent decrease in lipid production. Inhibition of [2-14C]acetate

incorporation was already seen at concentrations as low as 1 nmol/L
and was maximal at f100 nmol/L (Fig. 1A).
Fatty acid oxidation was measured by adding [1-14C]palmitic acid to
the medium. Conversion of [1-14C]palmitic acid to 14C-labeled CO2
was measured by scintillation counting. Soraphen A enhanced the
oxidation of fatty acids by 2- to 7-fold, depending on the cell line
(Fig. 1B).
Soraphen A decreases the amount of phospholipids of
prostate cancer cells. The major end product of fatty acids in
cancer cells are phospholipids (41). Therefore, the effect of
soraphen A on this lipid class was studied with [2-14C]acetate. In
all cell lines tested, soraphen A induced a dramatic dose-dependent
decrease in de novo synthesis of phospholipids (Fig. 2, top panels).
Already at a concentration of 10 nmol/L soraphen A, labeling
of phospholipids had dropped to 13% of control levels. Labeling
of cholesterol was unaffected. Quantitation of total amounts of
phospholipids revealed a dose-dependent decrease of phospholipids down to 50% to 60% of control in prostate cancer cells.
Interestingly, in BPH-1 cells, no significant changes in phospholipid
levels could be observed (Fig. 2, bottom panels). Levels of
cholesterol were unaffected in all cell lines.
Soraphen A inhibits proliferation and induces cell death
selectively in cancer cells. To explore the effect of soraphen A on
cell proliferation and cell survival, cells were collected at different
time points after treatment with soraphen A, stained with trypan
blue, and counted. Treatment of LNCaP and PC-3M cells with
soraphen A resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the number
of viable cells. By contrast, BPH-1 cells (Fig. 3, top panels) and
nonmalignant human skin fibroblasts (data not shown) continued
to proliferate normally.

These results were confirmed by BrdUrd incorporation (data not
shown); treatment of cells with soraphen A for 72 h resulted in a
significant decrease in proliferation in LNCaP and PC-3M prostate
cancer cells. In the BPH-1 control cell line, effects of soraphen A
were less prominent.
Furthermore, trypan blue staining indicated soraphen A to cause
cell death in the LNCaP and PC-3M cell line. The percentage of
dead cells increased dose-dependently, reaching 50% and 30% in
LNCaP and PC-3M cells, respectively, at 120 h after treatment with
1 Amol/L soraphen A (Fig. 3, bottom panels). In the BPH-1 (Fig. 3,
bottom panels) and nonmalignant fibroblasts (data not shown),
however, there was no evidence for an increase in cell death caused
by soraphen A.
These effects of soraphen A were confirmed by FACS analysis. As
shown in Table 1, soraphen A induced an accumulation of cancer
cells in the G0-G1 phase and in the sub-G1 fraction and caused a
marked reduction of cells in the S and the G2-M phase. In BPH-1
cultures, no increase in sub-G1 cells was observed and the effects
on the various phases of the cell cycle were much less pronounced
than in the cancer cell cultures.
Soraphen A induces apoptosis in LNCaP cells and autophagy
in PC-3M cells. To test whether soraphen A–treated cancer cells
die through induction of apoptosis, cells were stained with the
nuclear dye Hoechst 33342. As illustrated in Fig. 4A, LNCaP cells
treated with 100 nmol/L soraphen A displayed DNA condensation
and nuclear fragmentation, which are typical hallmarks of
apoptotic cell death. The presence of apoptosis in LNCaP cells
was confirmed by staining with propidium iodide (a membrane
impermeable dye) and Annexin V–FITC (a protein that binds with
high affinity to the phospholipid phosphatidylserine). In healthy

or 1  105 per dish (PC-3M, BPH-1). Twenty-four hours later, cells were treated with soraphen A as indicated. At different time points after treatment, cells were
collected and stained with trypan blue; the number of viable cells and percentage of dead cells were counted. Results are representative of three independent
experiments. Points and columns, means of triplicate measurements; bars, SE. Top panels, viable cells. Significantly different (P < 0.05) from control (0 nmol/L) after

cells, phosphatidylserine is located almost exclusively on the inner
side of the cellular membrane, whereas in apoptotic cells, it is
translocated to the outer membrane leaflet. LNCaP cells stained
positive for Annexin V–FITC, which reflects apoptosis. Some cells
stain positive both for Annexin V–FITC and propidium iodide, a
pattern reflecting membrane disruption, which is characteristic for
later stages of apoptosis or necrosis (Fig. 4A). Ninety-six hours after
treatment with soraphen A, we also observed the cleavage of PARP,
a major substrate of the apoptosis effector caspase-3 (Fig. 4B). As
lipogenesis, cell proliferation, and cell survival of LNCaP cells are
regulated by androgens (33, 42), we examined the effect of
soraphen A in the absence and presence of the synthetic androgen
R1181. As expected, R1881 dose-dependently affected proliferation
and survival; however, it did not influence the efficacy nor did it
change the mode of cell death caused by soraphen A, as measured
by trypan blue exclusion and Hoechst staining, respectively (data
not shown).
In PC-3M cells, treatment with soraphen A for 96 h did not induce
DNA condensation and nuclear fragmentation and failed
to induce PARP cleavage and led to the appearance of Annexin
V–FITC–negative and propidium iodide–positive cells, indicating
necrosis (Fig. 4A). These data show that PC-3M cells do not undergo
apoptosis. To examine alternative mechanisms of cell death,
we studied the effect of soraphen A on the localization of LC3, a
marker of autophagy (Fig. 4A). During autophagy, cytosolic LC3-I
is processed to form the membrane-associated LC3-II, which is

associated with autophagosomes. In PC-3M cells, transfected with a
plasmid encoding EGFP-LC3, soraphen A caused a redistribution of
EGFP-LC3 into vesicular structures, as visualized by fluorescence
microscopy, which is indicative of autophagic cell death. This was
also confirmed by Western blotting for endogenous LC3 (Fig. 4B),
revealing a major shift from the cytosolic LC3-I form to the
membrane-associated LC3-II form. The involvement of autophagy
was further correlated by staining with monodansylcadaverine.
Under specific fixation conditions, monodansylcadaverine is
retained in autophagosomal membranes (37, 39). In PC-3M cells
treated with soraphen A, monodansylcadaverine-positive structures
could be visualized starting from 48 h (data not shown), reaching a
maximum after 96 h, again indicating autophagy (Fig. 4A). Signs of
autophagy were absent in LNCaP cells.
To confirm the involvement of apoptosis and autophagy in
LNCaP and PC-3M cells, respectively, trypan blue–positive cells
were counted after treatment with soraphen A and z-VAD-fmk or
3-methyladenine, inhibitors of apoptosis and autophagy, respectively. In LNCaP cells, a significant reduction of trypan blue–
positive cells was seen in the presence of z-VAD-fmk, thereby
confirming the apoptotic nature of cell death in LNCaP cells.
Adding an inhibitor of apoptosis to soraphen A–treated PC-3M
cells could not prevent cell death, whereas simultaneous treatment
with soraphen A and 3-methyladenine prevented the cells from
dying (Fig. 4C). Taken together, these data indicate that the
majority of the observed cell death in PC-3M cells treated with
soraphen A cannot be attributed to apoptosis, but instead is caused
by autophagy.
Palmitic acid suppresses the cytotoxicity of soraphen A in
cancer cells. To examine whether the death-inducing effects of
soraphen A are in fact due to cellular depletion of fatty acids,
LNCaP and PC-3M cells were incubated with soraphen A in
medium supplemented with exogenous palmitic acid and dead
cells were counted by trypan blue staining. As illustrated by Fig. 5,
palmitic acid reduced the percentage of dead cells from apparently
30% to 5% to 10% (similar to control levels), indicating that
addition of palmitic acid almost completely rescues cells from
soraphen A–induced cell death. These effects were not caused by a
reduction in the uptake or efficacy of soraphen A. In fact, although
palmitic acid reduced [2-14C]acetate incorporation in cellular lipids
(as expected), soraphen A reduced [2-14C]acetate incorporation to
the same level as in the absence of palmitic acid (Fig. 5B). This
indicates that the observed cell death in prostate cancer cells is
caused by depletion of fatty acids.

Discussion
Here, we show that ACC activity plays a cardinal role in the lipid
homeostasis of cancer cells. Treatment of LNCaP and PC-3M
prostate cancer cells with soraphen A, a highly powerful dual
inhibitor of ACCs with a well-known and unique mechanism of
action (31, 32), potently inhibited lipid synthesis and increased fatty
acid oxidation. Cells stopped proliferating and were arrested in the
G0-G1 phase of the cell cycle. A substantial fraction of the cells
ultimately died. In LNCaP cells, soraphen A activated the apoptosis
program, whereas in PC-3M cells, cell death was associated with
the induction of autophagy. Although it remains unclear why the
two cancer cell lines died through different mechanisms, several
lines of evidence point to a shortage of lipids as the main trigger of
cell death: (a) cell death in both cell lines was accompanied by a
significant decrease in the cellular levels of phospholipids; (b)

administration of exogenous palmitic acid completely rescued the
cells from cell death; and (c) in the premalignant prostatic cell line
BPH-1, which did not display a significant change in the cellular
levels of phospholipids upon exposure to soraphen A, no induction

of cell death was observed. As dual inhibition of ACCs by soraphen
A blocks the formation of malonyl-CoA, these findings provide final
evidence that a decrease in the cellular fatty acid supply per se may
cause cancer cell death. These observations do not preclude that

increases in malonyl-CoA may also be involved in the mechanism
of cell death induced by inhibition of FASN. They do, however,
indicate that ACCs play an essential role in the lipid homeostasis in
cancer cells and that, in addition to FASN, ACCs may also be
attractive targets for antineoplastic intervention. One interesting
observation in this respect is the differential sensitivity of the
cancer cells and the premalignant cells to soraphen A. Despite the
fact that soraphen A decreased [2-14C]acetate incorporation in
phospholipids in the premalignant cells, it did not evoke significant
changes in the phospholipid content. Concomitantly, the proliferation and survival of premalignant cells were only marginally
affected by the compound. The reason for this insensitivity remains
poorly understood and is subject to further investigation. As BPH-1
and PC-3M proliferated at similar rates, the relative insensitivity of
the premalignant cells cannot be explained merely by differences in
growth rate. It is possible that the differential selectivity is caused
by the somewhat lower rate of fatty acid oxidation in BPH-1 cells.
An attractive alternative explanation is that cancer cells and
premalignant cells exhibit differences in transporter-mediated
uptake of exogenous lipids, providing a basis for cancer selective
effects of ACC and FASN inhibitors. At high concentrations, the
uptake of exogenous fatty acids becomes transporter independent,
overriding differences in fatty acid uptake. This feature may also
explain why no induction of cell death was seen previously with
TOFA (23). TOFA is a fatty acid derivative that is rapidly
metabolized in cancer cells and at high concentrations may even
rescue cells from fatty acid depletion (43, 44). As serum levels of
fatty acids in healthy individuals are even higher than those in
medium used for supplementation, one might argue that ACC
inhibitors would have no effect on cancer cells in vivo. Systemic
administration of ACC inhibitors, however, is expected to decrease
levels of circulating lipids (45). Perhaps more importantly, recent

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (17). September 1, 2007

findings have indicated that cancer cells express decreased levels of
lipoprotein lipase (46). This would reduce the access of cancer cells
to circulating lipids and provide another mechanism to render
cancer tissue more prone to fatty acid depletion by ACC and FASN
inhibitors than normal tissue. Although soraphen A is a unique new
tool to study the role of altered fatty acid metabolism in cancer
cells, to test in vivo it would require a different pharmaceutical
formulation due to its poor water solubility and its low
bioavailability. With the recent surge of interest in this class of
enzyme inhibitors also for other medical applications, including
treatment of the metabolic syndrome (45, 47), new compounds
may become available, allowing to test the concept of ACC
inhibition for antineoplastic therapy.
In conclusion, to our knowledge, this is the first study showing
that a chemical ACC inhibitor completely blocks fatty acid
synthesis and decreases phospholipid levels in cancer cells.
Inhibition is already evident at nanomolar concentrations and
results in induction of cell death selectively in cancer cells, thereby
further underscoring the potential of lipogenesis inhibition (and
more in particular ACC inhibition) for future antineoplastic
therapies.
