Abstract

Author Manuscript

Tumor vessels are characterized by abnormal morphology and hyper-permeability that together
cause inefficient delivery of chemotherapeutic agents. Although VEGF has been established as a
critical regulator of tumor angiogenesis, the role of mechanical signaling in the regulation of
tumor vasculature or tumor endothelial cell (TEC) function is not known. Here, we show that the
mechanosensitive ion channel TRPV4 regulates tumor angiogenesis and tumor vessel maturation
via modulation of TEC mechanosensitivity. We found that TEC exhibit reduced TRPV4
expression and function, which is correlated with aberrant mechanosensitivity towards ECM
stiffness, increased migration and abnormal angiogenesis by TEC. Further, syngeneic tumor
experiments revealed that the absence of TRPV4 induced increased vascular density, vessel
diameter and reduced pericyte coverage resulting in enhanced tumor growth in TRPV4 KO mice.
Importantly, overexpression or pharmacological activation of TRPV4 restored aberrant TEC
mechanosensitivity, migration and normalized abnormal angiogenesis in vitro by modulating Rho

Introduction
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing capillaries, is critical for
solid tumor maintenance, growth and progression as it ensures proper oxygen and nutrient
delivery to the tumor. However, the tumor vasculature is structurally and functionally
abnormal, as characterized by its high tortuosity, non-uniform pericyte coverage and hyperpermeability1, 2. These abnormal vessels cause irregular blood flow and distribution,
impaired oxygen delivery and impede immune cell function, which together lead to
inefficient delivery of anti-cancer agents causing tumor cell resistance to radiation and
chemotherapies3-5. Conventional anti-angiogenic therapies focus on either neutralizing the
effect of soluble angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) using
specific antibodies or inhibiting VEGFR kinase activity6-8. These conventional antiangiogenic strategies showed only modest success in clinical trials due to the development
of resistance (evasive or intrinsic) as tumor endothelial cells (TEC) became refractory to
anti-VEGF therapy over time3-5. These findings led to the emergence of a new concept
called “vascular normalization”, i.e. transient inhibition of tumor angiogenesis leading to
normalization of tumor vasculature which improves the efficacy of chemo- and radio
therapies 1, 2. Although vascular normalization combined with chemotherapy have shown
transient benefits, clinically they failed to exhibit long term beneficial effects owing to these
strategies still being focused onVEGF-targeted therapies, despite their shortcomings 2, 9, 10.
Infact, recent positron emission tomograpy (PET) imaging results have demonstrated a rapid
decrease in the delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs to tumors post anti-VEGF therapy, in
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients 11.Therefore, an urgent need arises for the
development of novel vascular normalization strategies.

In addition to soluble stimuli, such as VEGF and PDGF (platelet derived growth factor)
local mechanical cues conveyed by the extracellular matrix (ECM), due to cyclic
deformation of blood vessels and hemodynamic forces, are also potent inducers of
directional capillary growth and vascular remodeling in vitro and in vivo 12-16. Endothelial
cells (ECs) sense mechanical forces associated with tissue distortion through integrin
receptors that mediate their adhesion to the surrounding ECM12, 14, 15, 17. Unlike normal
ECM, the tumor ECM becomes stiffer as a result of continuous remodeling of matrix
components by tumor cells and stromal fibroblasts. Further, the tumor vasculature is hyperpermeable due to irregular basement membrane and poor pericyte coverage and therefore
releases plasma components into the surrounding extracellular space, eventually leading to

increased ECM stiffness. Cells sense changes in ECM stiffness through integrin receptors
which transduce these mechanical signals into the cell through the actin cytoskeleton. As
shown previously in tumor epithelial cells18, 19 and TEC20, this increase in ECM stiffness
also feeds back to enhance integrin-mediated Rho/ROCK (Rho-associated kinase) activity
and contraction that can lead to aberrant mechanosensitivity of TEC.

Author Manuscript

One of the earliest responses of cells to mechanical force is the influx of calcium through the
activation of mechanosensitive ion channels21-23. Although activation of these channels is
thought to be independent of integrin mechanosensing, several lines of evidence indicate that
both integrins and mechanosensitive ion channels are well connected22, 24-28. We have
previously shown that the application of cyclic strain to normal endothelial cells (NEC)
induces cell reorientation through activation of mechanosensitive Transient Receptor
Potential Vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) ion channel-dependent calcium influx, which in turn activates
additional integrins and causes down-stream cytoskeletal reorganization16. Importantly,
siRNA knockdown of TRPV4 channels inhibited mechanical strain-induced reorientation of
NEC, thus confirming their key role in endothelial cell mechanosensitivity. Notably,
endothelial cell mechanosensitivity strongly influences vascular formation and patterning20,
and thus, tumor vessel malformations could arise from deregulation of TEC
mechanosensing. Indeed, we have previously shown that TEC fail to reorient in response to
cyclic strain, exhibit aberrant mechanosensitivity to ECM stiffness and undergo abnormal
angiogenesis in vitro. Importantly, this abnormal TEC behavior resulted, at least in part,
from abnormally high basal Rho activity20. However, the upstream signaling molecule or the
molecular mechanism(s) governing high Rho-mediated aberrant mechanosensitivity and
angiogenesis by TEC remain unknown. In the present study, we explored whether the
mechanosensitive TRPV4 ion channel is a key determinant of TEC dysfunction leading to
tumor angiogenesis and abnormal vasculature.

Results
Tumor endothelial cells express lower levels of TRPV4 and TRPV4-dependent calcium
influx

Author Manuscript

We and others have previously shown that TRPV4 channels are functionally expressed in
endothelial cells and act as mechanosensor of cyclic stretch and flow16, 29. We also
demonstrated that TRPV4 channels induce mechanical force-dependent calcium influx in
integrin specific manner in endothelial cells and this TRPV4-dependent
mechanotransduction regulates cyclic strain–induced endothelial cell reorientation16.
Interestingly, we found that tumor derived endothelial cells (TEC) failed to reorient in
response to cyclic strain similar to that of TRPV4 knockdown endothelial cells suggesting
TEC may mimic TRPV4 knockdown phenotype 20. Because mechanical force (cyclic
strain)-induced reorientation in endothelial cells is dependent on TRPV4 channels16, we
investigated whether these channels contribute to the abnormal mechanosensitivity of
TEC20. TEC and normal EC (NEC) used in the present study have been isolated and
characterized for EC markers, EC function and mechanosensing at different passages20, 30.
We first compared TRPV4 expression levels between NEC and TEC using Western blot
analysis. While NEC exhibited strong expression of TRPV4,16, 31 it was significantly lower

in TEC (Fig.1A, B). To determine the functional implications of lower TRPV4 expression in
TEC, we measured calcium influx in Fluo-4/AM loaded cells, in response to the addition of
specific TRPV4 activators, GSK1016790A or 4-α-PDD. By using calcium imaging, patchclamp, siRNA knockdown and TRPV4 null cells, we have previously demonstrated that
these compounds specifically activates TRPV4-mediated calcium influx in endothelial
cells16, 31. GSK1016790A (100 nM) induced calcium influx in both NEC and TEC but the
influx in TEC was decreased by almost 40-50% compared to NEC (p≦0.001) (Fig.1C, D).
Another TRPV4 agonist, 4-α-PDD (10 μM) also induced a rapid calcium influx in NEC,
which was again significantly reduced by ∼40% (p≦ 0.01) in TEC (Supplementary Fig.S1
A, B). These results demonstrate that TRPV4 expression and function (calcium influx) are
impaired in TEC.

Next, to confirm if TRPV4 expression level contributes to tumor angiogenesis in vivo, we
induced tumors in TRPV4 KO and WT mice (C57BL/6) by subcutaneously injecting mouse
Lewis lung carcinoma cells (LLC). We found that tumor growth was 2-3 times greater in
TRPV4 KO mice compared to WT mice at day 21 (Fig.2A). Importantly,
immunohistochemical analysis revealed that tumors in TRPV4 KO mice exhibited a greater
fraction of hyper-dilated (malformed) vessels with significantly larger vessel diameters
(p≦0.05) compared to WT mice (Fig. 2, B, C). In contrast to tumor vessels in WT mice,
those in TRPV4 KO mice exhibited poor pericyte coverage, as determined by very weak αSMA staining, indicating the immature nature of these vessels. (Fig. 2D, E). Further, the
tumors from TRPV4 KO mice exhibited increased microvessel density compared to tumors
from WT mice (Supplementary Fig.S2 A, B). Next, we assessed the leakiness of TRPV4 KO
vessels by performing permeability assays using TRITC-dextran (3000 MW) perfusion, via
tail vein injections. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed increased TRITC staining
within the tumor tissue, surrounding the vessels, in TRPV4 KO mice compared to WT
tumors suggesting that TRPV4KO vessels are indeed hyperpermeable (Suppl Fig.S3). Taken
together, these results clearly suggest that TRPV4 plays a critical role in modulating tumor
angiogenesis and the absence of TRPV4 can lead to abnormal tumor angiogenesis
(immature (leaky) vessels), possibly through altered mechanotransduction exhibited by
endothelial cells.
TRPV4 overexpression restores mechanosensitivity and reduces abnormal cell
migration in tumor endothelial cells

Author Manuscript

The above findings suggest that lower levels of TRPV4, a known mechanosensor in
endothelial cells 16, 22, 32, 33 may contribute to the previously reported aberrant
mechanosensitivity of TEC in response to ECM stiffness and cyclic strain 20. Since ECM
stiffness is known to increase in tumors 19, which can also influence TEC spreading,
migration and tube formation, we investigated if overexpression of TRPV4 might rescue the
abnormal mechanosensitivity exhibited by TEC. To achieve this, we expressed a human
TRPV4-EGFP construct in TEC; EGFP fluorescence revealed that more than 80% cells were
transfected with TRPV4-EGFP (Supplementary Fig. S4A). We found that overexpression of
TRPV4 increased GSK1016790A-induced calcium influx in TEC by almost 4-fold (p≦
0.01) compared to EGFP-alone expressing cells (Supplementary Fig.S4 B, C). The other

TRPV4 specific activator, 4-α-PDD, also increased calcium influx in these TRPV4transfected TEC cells compared to EGFP-expressing controls (not shown).

To explore if TRPV4 overexpression influences TEC mechanosensitivity towards ECM
stiffness, we next cultured TRPV4-overexpressing TEC on transglutaminase linked gelatin
gels of varying stiffness (370 and 2280 Pa; representing intermediate and high stiffness,
respectively) which mimic the stiffness of tumor ECM 19 for 6 h and compared their degree
of spreading20 with that of control EGFP-expressing cells (Fig. 3A, B). In past studies, we
found that both NEC and TEC spread similarly on low stiffness (98 Pa) gels20. However, in
that study, NEC exhibited increased spreading on intermediate stiffness (370 Pa) which
reached plateau at high stiffness (2280 Pa) while TEC continue to increase their spreading
with increased stiffness. Therefore, in the present study, we focused on intermediate (370
Pa) and high (2280 Pa) stiffness gels. We found that NEC (expressing only EGFP) spread to
similar extent on both intermediate and high stiffness gels (370 and 2280 Pa) further
confirming that the spreading of NEC reached plateau at 370 Pa (Fig.3 A, B), similar to our
previous study20. On the other hand, spreading of TEC (expressing only EGFP) was
significantly more on high stiffness gels compared to intermediate stiffness gels (Fig.3 A,B).
In contrast, TEC-TRPV4-EGFP exhibited reduced spreading on high stiffness gels
compared to TEC-EGFP alone, with no significant difference between intermediate and high
stiffness substrates (Fig. 3A, B) suggesting that TRPV4 overexpression restored substrate
mechanosensitivity in these cells. We did not find any change in NEC spreading when
TRPV4-EGFP was overexpressed (data not shown). To further confirm that TRPV4
overexpression restores mechanosensitivity, we exposed TEC-EGFP and TEC-TRPV4EGFP cells to cyclic strain, which is widely used to test endothelial cell mechanosensitivity,
as previously described16. As shown earlier20, we found that TEC-EGFP failed to reorient
while TEC overexpressing TRPV4-EGFP significantly oriented in response to cyclic strain
(data not shown).

Since cell migration is dependent on mechanosensing of matrix stiffness and is a critical
component of angiogenesis, we next explored if TRPV4 overexpression which normalized
mechanosensitivity also influence TEC migration. To demonstrate this, we chose substrates
of intermediary stiffness, as they supported optimal TEC cell spreading with or without
TRPV4 overexpression. Consistent with their abnormal mechanosensitivity, TEC exhibited
high cell migration speed (40 μm/h; (Fig.3 C, D), which was significantly suppressed (10
μm/h) when cells were transfected with TRPV4 (Fig.3 C, D). Further, we found that NEC
migrated at a speed of 10 μm/h (Supplementary Fig.S5) suggesting that overexpression of
TRPV4 normalized TEC cell migration to that of NEC. Taken together, all the above
findings clearly demonstrate that TRPV4 expression restored mechanosensitivity in TEC
and normalized migration.

formation and if so, further determine the molecular mechanisms that underlie this process.
First, TEC expressing TRPV4-EGFP or EGFP alone were tested for their ability to form
capillary networks using a Matrigel® based in vitro 2D angiogenesis assays. We have
previously shown that TEC form robust tubes when plated at low density (2 × 104 cells/
well) on Matrigel (2D) but at high density (8 × 104 cells/ well), these cells form tubes and
then undergo multicellular retraction with disruption of tubular networks20. Importantly,
TEC cultured within (rather than on top of) Matrigel formed tubular structures that were
abnormally dilated and non-uniform, an abnormal morphology 20; (Fig. 4A) reminiscent of
that observed within the cancer microvasculature in vivo, whereas NEC reorganized into
tubular structures of relatively uniform size under similar culture conditions. These findings
suggest that TEC are capable of tube formation in both 2D and 3D Matrigels. However, they
collapse on 2D Matrigel due to high contraction mediated by cumulative high Rho
activity 34, but form abnormal tubes in 3D. Therefore, we used both 2D and 3D Matrigel
assays to determine if TRPV4 overexpression could normalize abnormal tube formation by
TEC. To achieve this, first, we plated TEC expressing EGFP alone or overexpressing
TRPV4 (expressing TRPV4-EGFP) at high density (8 × 104 cells/ well) on Matrigel for 2D
tube formation. As expected, TEC expressing EGFP alone, formed tubes at high density (8 ×
104 cells/ well) but these formed tubes underwent multicellular retraction and collapsed (Fig.
4A). In contrast, TEC overexpressing TRPV4 formed a robust tubular network, with
quantitative analysis revealing a significant increase (almost 10 fold) in tube length in
TRPV4-expressing TEC compared to EGFP-expressing counterparts (Supplementary
Fig.S6). Interestingly, we did not find any change in tube formation by NEC either
expressing EGFP alone (Fig.4A) or overexpressing TRPV4-EGFP (not shown). We also
found that TRPV4 overexpression normalized tube formation in 3D Matrigels (Fig4A).

Author Manuscript

Next, we examined if pharmacological activation of TRPV4 normalizes abnormal tube
formation in vitro. For this, we activated TRPV4 in TEC using the small molecule activator
of TRPV4, GSK1016790A (GSK; 100 nM). We found that, similar to TRPV4
overexpression, TEC, but not NEC, treated with GSK formed robust tubes at high plating
density (8 × 104 cells/ well) (Fig.4B). Since activity-dependent regulation of ion channels
was shown in various cancers35, 36, we then asked if activation of TRPV4 with GSK
modulates TRPV4 expression in TEC. We found that treatment of TEC with GSK for 24 h
significantly increased TRPV4 protein expression (Fig. 4C). These results demonstrate that
TRPV4 overexpression or pharmacological activation by GSK normalizes abnormal
angiogenesis exhibited by TEC through the restoration of mechanosensitivity towards ECM
stiffness and thus identifies TRPV4 as a critical mediator of angiogenesis.

Author Manuscript

To understand the molecular mechanism downstream of TRPV4 that mediates normalization
of angiogenesis, we focused on Rho which regulates endothelial contraction that is required
for partial rounding of endothelial cells during tube formation (34). We have previously
demonstrated that TEC (expressing only EGFP) showed high basal Rho activity 20 which is
the reason for abnormal collapse of TEC on 2D Matrigel, when plated at high densities.
However, we found that overexpression of TRPV4-EGFP significantly reduced this high
basal Rho activity exhibited by TEC (approximately ½-fold lower; p≦0.001) (Fig.4 D). We
found that TRPV4 activator GSK1016790A (100 nM) also inhibited high basal Rho activity

in TEC (Supplementary Fig.S7) suggesting that TRPV4 is a critical modulator of Rho
activity in TEC.
TRPV4 specific small molecule activator GSK1016790A normalizes tumor vasculature in
vivo and reduces tumor growth in combination with Cisplatin

Author Manuscript

Finally, we explored if pharmacological activation of TRPV4 induces tumor vascular
normalization/maturation in vivo and improves efficacy of chemotherapeutic drug
(Cisplatin). To achieve this, we injected TRPV4 activator GSK1016790A intraperitonially
every day for 14 days in WT mice that had developed palpable tumors (around 100 mm3,
after 7 days). Cisplatin was given once per week starting 2-4 days after GSK treatment and
tumor growth was monitored every week until day 21. First, we examined vessel maturity in
tumors by staining for pericyte coverage. We observed that the vessels in GSK and GSKCisiplatin-treated tumors, but not in control or Cisplatin treated ones, showed increased
pericyte coverage (Fig.5A, B) suggesting that TRPV4 activation normalized tumor
angiogenesis and induced vessel maturation which may help efficient delivery of Cisplatin.
Consistent with this observation, we found that tumor growth was markedly reduced in
GSK-Cisplatin treated animals (Fig.5C), but not in control or Cisplatin treated mice,
suggesting the improved delivery of Cisplatin due to the normalization of vessels by TRPV4
activation.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Tumor angiogenesis has been widely shown to be regulated by soluble growth factors such
as VEGF and fibroblast growth factor (FGF). However, regulation of tumor angiogenesis by
mechanical forces is not well known. In the present study, we found that tumor endothelial
cells express lower levels of TRPV4, a mechanosensitive ion channel, which is a key
upstream signaling molecule that regulates tumor endothelial cell mechanosensitivity, tumor
angiogenesis and tumor vessel maturation. Importantly, we demonstrate that overexpression
of TRPV4 normalizes aberrant TEC mechanosensitivity, migration and angiogenesis through
modulation of Rho activity. We further confirmed these findings in vivo by demonstrating
that TRPV4 KO mice lacking this mechanosensing molecule exhibit severe tumor vessel
malformations, characterized by increased vessel diameter, length and density, and enhanced
tumor growth. Finally, we demonstrated that administration of the specific small molecule
TRPV4 activator, GSK1016790A induced vessel maturation and, in combination with a
chemotherapeutic drug, Cisplatin, reduced tumor growth in WT mice. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate a role for TRPV4 in angiogenesis in vitro
or in vivo.

TRPV4 channels are non-selective calcium ion channels ubiquitously expressed in
endothelial cells that act as a mechanosensor of cyclic strain and shear stress in endothelial
cells 16, 22, 29, 32, 33, 37. We have previously shown that endothelial cells express functional
TRPV4 channels (Fluo-4 imaging, patch-clamp) and that these channels mediate mechanical
signals from integrin to integrin that are critical for reorientation of NEC in response to
cyclic strain 16. The fact that EC isolated from tumors fail to reorient in response to cyclic
strain and exhibit aberrant mechanosensitivity towards substrate stiffness20, suggested that

TRPV4 channel signaling might be altered in these cells. Indeed, we found that TEC express
low levels of functionally active TRPV4 channels compared to NEC. TRPV4 protein usually
exhibits two bands that are below and above of 100 kDa in Western blots16,29,53-56.
Although the upper band has been demonstrated to be the glycosylated form of TRPV453
which influences its membrane translocation and activity, we did not find any significant
difference in terms of the relative amount of each band in NEC or TEC, suggesting that
TRPV4 expression is down-regulated. Consistently, TRPV4 expression has been shown to
be modulated by microRNA -20357. However, it is not clear how tumor cells or tumor
stroma may influence TRPV4 expression in TEC. Importantly, we demonstrate that TRPV4
overexpression or pharmacological activation by a small molecular activator, restored
mechanosensitivity to matrix stiffness and cyclic strain, reduced migration and normalized
the abnormal angiogenesis exhibited by TEC in vitro.

The aberrant mechanosensitivity of TEC is known to be mediated by high basal Rho
activity20; however, the molecular mechanism up-stream of Rho responsible for this
abnormal behavior is not yet known. Here, we show that overexpression of TRPV4
significantly inhibited high basal Rho activity in TEC. This reduction in basal Rho activity
could possibly inhibit the high basal contraction of TEC 34 which then may be responsible
for the restored mechanosensitivity of these cells towards substrate stiffness and
normalization of angiogenesis. In fact, transient inhibition of Rho kinase with Y-27632 can
normalize TEC responses to cyclic strain20. Although the exact molecular mechanism
through which TRPV4 regulates Rho activity is not known, it is plausible that TRPV4 exerts
its effects by modulating integrin activation, which has been shown to be sensitive to
mechanical force-induced TRPV4-dependent calcium influx16. Importantly, binding of
integrins to ECM transiently inhibit Rho activity38, 39 and facilitate cell shape changes,
leading to cell spreading and reorientation. Interference with binding of additional integrins
using function blocking antibodies also significantly inhibits TRPV4-dependent cyclic
strain-induced CE reorientation16.

Author Manuscript

Although TRPV4 role in endothelial migration was shown 40, the role of TRPV4 in
physiological or pathological angiogenesis is not demonstrated. Our results demonstrating
TRPV4 overexpression normalized tube/vessel formation in 2D Matrigels, coupled with
increased vessel malformations and enhanced tumor growth in TRPV4 KO mice, confirms
that TRPV4 plays a critical role in tumor angiogenesis. Further, combination of GSK and
Cisplatin, but not each them alone, inhibited tumor growth suggesting that TRPV4
activation-induced vascular maturation improved the efficacy of Cisplatin. These findings
have significant value in vascular normalization therapies directed towards the treatment of
cancer. Since the initial proposal that tumors rely on neovascularization for their survival and
growth41, 42, angiogenesis has become a potential target for cancer therapy. In fact, multiple
angiogenesis inhibitors have now been identified, and some clinically approved (e.g.,
Avastin), that inhibit the growth of a wide variety of experimental tumors in many animal
models albeit with limited success in patients. Although VEGF is required for normal
proliferation and migration of EC, it is important to emphasize that the tumor vasculature in
certain cancers, such as in renal cell carcinoma, is largely refractory to therapies designed to
alter VEGF signaling, as growth factors are redundant for angiogenesis 3-6, 43. Nevertheless,
current vascular normalization therapies still focus on targeting soluble growth factors such

as VEGF and PDGF 2, 10, 44-51. Notably, recently it was shown NSCLC patients treated with
humanized VEGF antibody, bevacizumab reduced both perfusion and net influx rate of
[(11)C] docetaxel within 5 h as measured by PET. Further, it was demonstrated that these
effects persisted even after 4 days11. Importantly, these findings show no evidence for a
substantial improvement in drug delivery to tumors by anti-VEGF treatment and highlight
the importance of drug scheduling and supports further studies to optimize scheduling or the
use of anti-angiogenic drugs.

Author Manuscript

Thus, our results showing that a mechanosensitive ion channel, TRPV4 regulates tumor
angiogenesis through the modulation of Rho-dependent mechanosensitivity of TEC and, a
small molecule activator of TRPV4, GSK1016790A together with Cisplatin, inhibits tumor
growth, suggests TRPV4 as a target for developing a novel mechanotransduction-based
therapy for vascular normalization. To our knowledge, TRPV4 channels have not previously
been studied as potential therapeutic targets in angiogenesis, therefore we believe that
elucidation of TRPV4-dependent mechanotransduction mechanisms and their role in
angiogenesis may open entirely new avenues for developmental therapeutics for cancer as
well as other angiogenic disorders, such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic
retinopathy.

Normal (NEC) and Tumor (TEC) endothelial cells were obtained from a transgenic
adenocarcinoma mouse prostate (TRAMP) model, as previously described20, 30. Cells were
plated on fibronectin (FN) or gelatin-coated tissue culture dishes and grown in a defined
medium composed of low glucose DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum, 10% Nu Serum IV,
VEGF(1ng/ml) basic fibroblast growth factor (3 ng/ml), heparin salt (0.1 mg/ml), 1%
insulin-transferrin-selenium and antibiotic/mycotic mix. Cells were cultured in a 37°C,
5%CO2 incubator, split at ∼90-95% confluence, and used between passages 11-22. These
cells (NEC and TEC) were characterized for the presence of endothelial markers and
function. We found that both of these cells expressed endothelial markers including
CD31(PECAM-1), VE-cadherin, Von Wildebrand Factor (vWF), endothelial nitric oxide
synthase (eNOS) and bind to isolectin-IB4 as measured by FACS, Western blotting, RT-PCR
and immunocytochemistry. In contrast, these cells do not express mesenchymal markers αSMA and PDGFR-β receptor20, 30. NEC and TEC formed robust tubular structures/sprouts
in 2D and 3D Matrigel/Fibrin gel angiogenesis assays further confirming that these are
functional EC 20, 30. We have shown these EC retained their endothelial phenotype and
TRPV4 expression (not shown) even up to 22 passages20.
Transfection
Cells were transfected with TRPV4-EGFP (kind gift of Dr. Jendrach, Germany) or EGFP
constructs using targefect (targetingsystems)31. The transfection efficiency was found to be
80-90%.

bottom dishes and loaded with Fluo-4/AM (1-4 μM) for 30 min, washed 3 times in calcium
medium (136 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl,1.2 mM MgSO4, 1.1 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 5
mM NaHCO3, 5.5mM glucose, and 20 mM Hepes. pH 7.4). Cells were stimulated with
TRPV4 activators 4-α-PDD (Sigma-Aldrich; 10 μM) or GSK1016790A (100 nM) in
calcium medium16, 22, 31. Calcium imaging was performed on Leica SP2 Confocal
Microscope or Olympus FluoView 300 confocal microscope and analyzed using Leica/
Olympus software and Microsoft Excel. We have previously confirmed that TRPV4
channels are expressed in WT and NEC and that TRPV4 activators 4-α-PDD (10 μM) or
GSK1016790A (100 nM) specifically induce calcium influx in TRPV4 expressing but not
TRPV4 null endothelial cells in the calcium containing media31.

Cells were lysed in TritonX-100 with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Boston
Bioproducts). Cell lysates were separated by electrophoresis on 8% SDS- polyacrylamide
gels and transferred to Immobilon ® polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane
was blocked in 5% milk in TBS with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-Tw) for 1 h. The blot was then
incubated with the following primary antibodies anti-TRPV4 (1:300) (Alomone), anti-Actin
(1:1000). The ECL (Pierce West Pico) method was used with anti-rabbit (Jackson
Laboratories) at a dilution of 1:10,000 and developed using Kodak X-ray film or Protein
Simple. Results were quantified using Image J software.

In vitro angiogenesis assays

Author Manuscript

Growth factor-reduced Matrigel® (BD Biosciences) was plated on 48 well plates and kept at
37°C in an incubator for 30 min. Cells overexpressing TRPV4-EGFP or EGFP alone (2-8 ×
104 cells/well) were plated on Matrigel and incubated at 37°C for 16-18 h20. For 2D assays
performed in the presence or absence of TRPV4-specific agonist, cells were treated with
GSK1016790A (100nM) prior to plating. Tube formation was quantified by obtaining
images as described below.
Microscopy, image analysis and statistics

Author Manuscript

The expression of EGFP-TRPV4 in EC was visualized using a Nikon Eclipse TE 2000-E
microscope (Nikon, Japan) fitted with a CoolSnap HQ digital camera (Photometrics) or
Olympus IX72 fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Japan). The cells spread on flexible
gelatin hydrogels were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde while cells forming tubular
structures were left untreated, and samples from both studies were imaged using a Nikon
Diaphot 300 phase contrast microscope (Nikon, Japan) fitted with a Hamamatsu digital
camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan) or Olympus IX72 fluorescence microscope
(Olympus, Japan). Image analyses were performed using ImageJ software (NIH). For cell
spreading studies, TEC cell areas were measured by tracing cell perimeter and normalized as
described previously20. At least 30 cells were evaluated. For cell migration experiments, live
cell images were recorded with a CCD camera (Hamamatsu, Tokyo, Japan) on a Nikon
Eclipse TE 2000-E microscope (Nikon, Japan) or Olympus IX81 fluorescence microscope
(Olympus, Japan) equipped with phase contrast optics and processed using the Image J. The
microscope was also equipped with an on-stage heater that maintained the temperature at
37°C at all times, and the culture medium was covered with a thin layer of mineral oil to
prevent evaporation. Cell migration was measured by marking the centroids of the migrating
cell recorded at 20 min intervals over 2 h and then used to calculate the speed of cell
migration. All data are expressed as mean ± SEM and evaluated for differences using
student's t-test and/or one-way ANOVA.
Syngeneic tumor model in mice and analysis of tumor growth, vascular malformation
and angiogenesis

Author Manuscript

All the experiments were performed according to approved protocol by Northeast Ohio
Medical University, IACUC. Mouse Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells (2 × 106) were
subcutaneously injected in the flank region of wild type C57BL/6 mice (WT) or TRPV4
knockout mice in C57BL/6 background (KO). Tumor size was measured using calipers at 7,
14 and 21 days and tumor volume was calculated according to the formula V=
4/3*Pi*Length/2*(width/2)2. At day 21, mice were euthanized and tumor tissues were
collected and fixed for immunohistochemistry or stored at -80°C. To measure tumor
angiogenesis, tumor tissue sections of 10 μm thicknesses were stained with anti-CD31
(PECAM-1) to visualize the microvessels, α-SMA to stain pericytes and DAPI to label the
nuclei. Images were acquired using Olympus IX72 microscope and the microvessels density,
diameter (Feret) and length were calculated using Image J software. For the in vivo drug
experiments, six to eight mice/group were used and the animals were divided in to four
groups: 1) WT (control) 2) WT + TRPV4 activator 3) WT + Cisplatin and 4) WT + TRPV4

activator + Cisplatin. Once the tumors were palpable (after 7 days), the mice were daily
given an intraperitonial (i.p) injection of TRPV4 agonist GSK1016790A (10 μg/kg) to
groups 2 and 4 until day 21. The anti-cancer drug Cisplatin (3 mg/kg/week) was
administered i.p. once/week to groups 3, and 4, 3 days post treatment with TRPV4 activator,
until day 21. The WT control received saline as a vehicle.

i.p. everyday starting from day 7 (after palpable tumors were observed) until 21 days.
Cisplatin was injected i.p. (once/week) 3 days after the injection of GSK1016790A. Frozen
sections of tumors (10 μm thickness; from 21 day) were stained with CD31 (green) and αSMA (red) to measure pericyte coverage (matured vessels). B) Quantitative analysis of
pericyte covered microvessels in tumors from control, GSK, Cisplatin, and GSK + Cisplatin
treated mice. The results shown are mean ± SEM from 3 independent experiments. The
significance was set at p≦ 0.05. C) Tumor volumes among mice groups. Note that tumor
growth was reduced in GSK + Cisplatin (*) treated mice. However, treatment with either of
the drug alone did not inhibit tumor growth, indicating that GSK treatment improved
Cisplatin delivery through the normalization of the abnormal tumor vasculature.
