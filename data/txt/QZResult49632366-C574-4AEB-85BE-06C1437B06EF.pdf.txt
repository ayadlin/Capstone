BACKGROUND: Huachansu, a Chinese medicine that comes from dried toad venom from the skin glands of
Bufo gargarizans or B. melanostictus, has been used in the treatment of various cancers in China. The
authors conducted a pilot study, using a phase 1 trial design, of huachansu in patients with advanced cancer. METHODS: Huachansu was administered intravenously for 14 days followed by 7 days off (1 cycle).
Without significant adverse events or progressive disease, treatment continued beyond 2 cycles. The dose
of huachansu was escalated as follows with 3 patients per cohort: 10 (level 1), 20 (level 2), 40 (level 3), 60
(level 4), and 90 (level 5) mL/m2. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (hepatocellular cancer, n ¼ 11; nonsmall cell
lung cancer, n ¼ 2; pancreatic cancer, n ¼ 2) were enrolled in the trial, and no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)
were found. Eleven patients had no drug-related toxicity greater than grade 1. Six (40%) had stable disease
(median duration, 6.0 months; range, 3.5-11.1 months). One of these patients (with hepatocellular cancer)
had 20% regression (duration, 11 months) (dose level 1). Quality of life improved for patients with stable disease. Plasma bufalin concentration reached maximal levels at the end of the 2-hour infusion and was proportional to the amount of drug being administered (0.81-3.38 ng/mL). CONCLUSIONS: No DLT was
observed with the use of huachansu at doses up to 8 higher than typically used in China. Six patients had

Original Article

Chansu , initially recorded in traditional Chinese
medicine >1000 years ago, is dried toad venom or dried
secretion from the skin glands of Bufo gargarizans or B.
melanostictus.1 It has been used as a local anesthetic, a cardiotonic agent, and a diuretic,1,2 and is widely used to
treat cancer at oncology clinics in China.1-3
Huachansu is a sterilized hot water extract of dried
toad skin that has been prepared for injection. It is manufactured by Anhui Jinchan Biochemistry Company Ltd.
in Huaibei, China (Chinese Food and Drug Administration [FDA] ISO9002). The chemical components and
pharmacologic activity of huachansu have been investigated since the 1980s. Its 2 primary biologically active
chemical components are indole alkaloids (bufotenine,
bufotenidine, cinobufotenine, and serotonin) and steroidal cardiac glycosides (>28 have been identified, including bufalin, resibufogenin, cinobufagin, cinobufotalin,
marinobufagin, and bufotalin).3 Recent studies have demonstrated that bufalin, resibufogenin, and cinobufagin are
the 3 major cardiac glycosides to which the antitumor activity of huachansu can be attributed.4 A recent review article posits the emerging role of cardiac glycosides in the
prevention and/or treatment of proliferative diseases such
as cancer and suggests that Na,K-ATPase is a possible
drug target for this group of compounds. Cardiac glycosides are involved in complex cell-signal transduction
pathways and result in selective control of human tumor
but not normal cellular proliferation; thus, cardiac glycosides may represent a promising form of targeted cancer
chemotherapy.5
Chinese clinical trials conducted since the 1970s
have shown repeatedly that huachansu has anticancer activity. For example, total response (complete response
[CR] plus partial response [PR]) rates of 10% and 16%
were observed in patients with advanced hepatocellular
carcinoma and lung cancer, respectively, with only mild
adverse effects.6,7 Furthermore, when used in combination with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, huachansu synergistically enhanced the efficacy of the conventional
therapies and reduced their toxicity.8
Although this seemingly well-tolerated traditional
medicine is commonly used in China and is approved by
the Chinese FDA, no formal trials of the agent have been
done that examine dose-toxicity relationships. The doses
generally used in China are 20 mL/m2 or 20-25 mL. We
felt that this agent merited further exploration using a
5310

more formal, Western medicine-based approach, and that
this pilot trial should also explore a broader range of doses.
Therefore, we conducted a collaborative study between
Fudan University Cancer Hospital and The University of
Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center that is part of the
International Center of Traditional Chinese Medicine for
Cancer (funded in part by R21CA108084 and
U19CA12153031 from the National Cancer Institute).
Herein, we report the results of our pilot study, using a
phase 1 clinical trial design, of huachansu in patients with
hepatocellular carcinoma, nonsmall cell lung cancer, or
pancreatic cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Patients with stage III or IV hepatocellular carcinoma,
nonsmall cell lung cancer, or pancreatic cancer were considered eligible for enrollment in the trial, which was conducted at the Fudan University Cancer Hospital, in
Shanghai, China. Inclusion criteria were as follows: 18
years of age; histologic or cytologic diagnosis of 1 of the 3
aforementioned cancers with measurable lesions; life expectancy of at least 3 months; performance status of 60
(Karnofsky performance status scale); and adequate organ
function. Patients also must not have received any previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy for at least 3 weeks and
have recovered from any toxic effects of such therapy.
Patients previously treated with huachansu must have discontinued treatment at least 6 months earlier. Exclusion
criteria were central nervous system involvement; need for
concurrent radiotherapy or other chemotherapy; leukemia
or myelodysplastic syndrome; pregnancy or lactation;
symptomatic peripheral neuropathy; concurrent infection
requiring intravenous antibiotics; and a history of allergy
to toad skin products. Patients were prohibited from taking other medicines, herbs, supplements, and tonics.
Written informed consent, indicating the patients’ awareness of the investigational nature of this study, was
obtained from all patients.

Study Design
The study was collaboratively designed and conceived by
faculty from the Fudan University Cancer Hospital and

M. D. Anderson, and the protocol was approved by both
institutional review boards. Two nurses from Fudan University Cancer Hospital spent 3 months at M. D. Anderson undergoing research nurse training and 2 physicians
underwent 2 months of faculty research training. During
the course of the trial, faculty and staff from M. D. Anderson visited Fudan University Cancer Hospital 4 times to
review the trial, and video conferences were conducted
twice each month.
Patients were treated in cohorts of 3 per dose level
at 5 dose levels. For each subsequent cohort of patients,
dose escalation depended on the toxicity profile in the
previous cohort. The typical dose of huachansu used in
China is 20-25 mL (approximately 15 mL/m2). The
planned dose escalation schedule for huachansu was as
follows; level 1, 10 mL/m2; level 2, 20 mL/m2; level 3,
40 mL/m2; level 4, 60 mL/m2; and level 5, 90 mL/m2.
The treatment was repeated daily for 14 days followed by
7 days off (1 cycle). In the absence of treatment delays,
treatment was continued beyond 2 cycles. After 2 cycles,
most patients received other treatments in combination
with huachansu.
Anhui Jinchan Biochemistry Company Ltd. provided the drug for this trial from the same lot. There are
several quality control strategies in place to improve
and ensure product quality. The toad skins are acquired
from designated source provinces (Anhui and Shandong) in China, and the skin samples are only collected
in the fall. There is an established fingerprinting for the
toad skin raw material, the semifinal extracts, and final
product of huachansu. In addition, to eliminate the variation in the extracts of the toad skins collected from
different geographical regions, each final product lot is
a mix, at a fixed ratio, of toad skin extracts prepared
from each source province. Finally, analytical methods
have been established to monitor the quality of extract
and product. As a regular quality control measure, the
concentrations of certain compounds in the extract are
measured, and high performance liquid chromatography fingerprinting is compared in the semifinal and
final products. On the basis of these quality control
methods, huachansu has good consistency and
reproducibility.
The consistency of 3 separate lots of huachansu were
analyzed at M. D. Anderson, and levels of bufalin (18.019.5 ng/mL) and resibufogenin (17.7-19.0 ng/mL) were

remarkably close (<10% variation). In addition, molecular fingerprinting of 3 lots showed they were very similar.
In each lot, there were 7 individual peaks with peak areas
>2% of total peak area. The 7 peaks among the 3 lots had
similar retention time and peak area (<20% variation).
Although there was good consistency from lot to lot, it
was considered best for this trial to use huachansu processed in a single lot.

Outcomes Measures
Toxicity in each cohort of 3 patients treated at a particular
dose level was graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (http://ctep.info.
nih.gov). Response and progression were evaluated using
the criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumors (RECIST) committee.9
Evaluation of quality of life was preformed using the
M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) pretreatment and then weekly thereafter. The MDASI consists of
a core list of symptoms that are common to all cancer
diagnoses and treatments. The MDASI was found to have
good reliability and validity in a study of >500 outpatients with cancer.10

Patient Evaluation
Pretreatment evaluations included a complete history and
physical examination; complete blood count; differential,
platelet, and renal and hepatic function tests; cardiac perfusion scan; electrocardiogram; and radiologic imaging
studies and tumor marker evaluation to document the
extent of disease. Radiologic tests were done no more than
1 month before the start of treatment, and all other tests
were done no more than 2 weeks before the start of therapy. Patients also completed the high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) within 2 weeks of the start of
treatment.
On-study assessments included history and physical
examination after each of the first 2 cycles and weekly
assessments of complete blood count, platelet count, and
differential; hepatic and renal function tests; electrocardiogram, and MDASI. Appropriate radiologic and tumor
marker studies were repeated after the first 2 courses of
therapy.

Determination of Plasma Bufalin Content

Table 1. Patient Characteristics

To delineate the role of bufadienolides in antitumor efficacy and the cardiac toxicity of huachansu, we drew 5 mL
of blood for testing at the following time points: predose;
midinfusion; end of infusion; 24 hours after infusion;
Day 14 of cycle (predose); and Day 21 of cycle (before the
next infusion cycle). To prepare the sample for the determination of the plasma bufalin content, we diluted 1.5
mL of plasma with 1.5 mL of phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) and then applied to a preconditioned Sep-Pak solid
phase extraction cartridge (3 mL/100 mg, Waters Corp.,
Milford, Mass). The column was then washed with 3 mL
of water and bufalin was eluted with 3 mL of ethyl acetate,
after which the effluent was collected and evaporated. The
dried sample was then shipped to M. D. Anderson for
analysis of bufalin content, where the extract was reconstituted in 100 lL methanol:0.2% formic acid (1:1) before
analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem
mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). The specific bufalin
content was determined using a validated assay previously
developed at M. D. Anderson.
An LC-MS-MS analytical method was developed for
measuring levels of bufadienolide levels, including bufalin,
cinobufagin, resibufogenin, and cinobufotalin, in the huachansu injection as well as in human plasma specimens.
The limit of detection of this method was around 0.15 ng/
mL. The levels of bufalin, cinobufagin, cinobufotalin, and
resibufogenin in the huachansu injectant used in this phase
1 clinical trial were 14.3  0.03, 3.35  0.1, 21.5  0.22,
and 24.5  2.18 ng/mL, respectively. However, because
studies have shown that bufalin is the major bufodienolide
with the most pronounced anticancer activity,11-13 we
measured only the bufalin concentration in plasma by LCMS-MS. Reverse-phase HPLC electrospray ionization mass
spectrometry (MS) was performed using a Micromass
Quattro Ultima tandem mass spectrometer (Waters Corp,
Milford, Mass) equipped with an Agilent 1100 HP binary
pump high-pressure liquid chromatography inlet. Bufalin
was separated using a Luna C8 5l (4.6  100 mm) LC
column (Phenomenex, Torrence, Calif). The mobile phase
consisted of 0.2% formic acid (aqueous), pH 3.0, and
methanol; the flow rate was 250 lL/min, with a column
temperature of 50 C. The sample injection volume was 25
lL. The mass spectrometer was operated in the electrospray
positive-ion mode, with a cone voltage of 75 V. Fragmenta-

had a grade I rash during maintenance therapy with huachansu that lasted 1 week.
Cardiovascular toxicities

One patient who received the level 1 dose had grade
I premature ventricular contraction on Day 20 that
resolved on the same day. The same patient also had grade
II hypertension 16 hours after treatment, which resolved
by 4 hours later. There were no other abnormities
observed on the serial electrocardiograms for other
patients.
Other toxic effects

observed. Eleven patients had no drug-related toxicity
greater than grade I. Events known to be or suspected of
being related to either huachansu or to the disease state are
shown in Table 2. There were no abnormalities in hepatic
and renal function tests.
Toxicities by body system are described below.
Hematologic toxicities

Two types of hematologic toxicity were associated
with huachansu use. One patient developed grade I
thrombocytopenia on Day 6 after receiving the level 2
dose, but this resolved after 27 days. Another patient
developed grade I leukopenia on Day 14 after receiving
the level 4 dose, but this resolved after 7 days.

Grade I myalgia was noted in 1 patient treated with
the level 1 dose that occurred 50 days after medication
was started (maintenance therapy), and this condition
persisted for the duration of treatment; grade II dyspnea
occurred on Day 4 in 1 patient given a level 3 dose; the
dyspnea resolved within 30 minutes. Finally, persistent
grade I dizziness occurred in 1 patient 5 days after receiving a level 5 dose.
Maximum Tolerated Dose
There were no grade III/IV adverse events. As a result, no
dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were established. In addition, no cardiac toxicities were observed.

Gastrointestinal toxicities

Response

One patient given the level 1 dose of huachansu had
loss of appetite starting on Day 10, but the patient recovered his appetite after 30 days. One patient who received
the level 2 dose had grade I constipation on the first day,
but this condition resolved after 7 days. One patient given
the level 5 dose developed grade I diarrhea 2 days after
receiving the medication, and the toxicity did not resolve
until the completion of the study.

One patient with hepatocellular cancer dropped out of
the study after 1 cycle of treatment because the patient
had bone metastasis that needed radiation and refused to
provide a new computed tomography (CT) scan (Patient
9, Table 3). Therapy was classified as having failed in this
patient (Table 3). Six (40%) had stable disease, and 9
(60%) had progressive disease. One patient with hepatocellular carcinoma treated with the level 1 dose had a 20%
reduction in tumor mass RECIST9 and stable disease in
response to huachansu alone that lasted for 11.1 months
(Table 3, Fig. 1). a-Fetoprotein (AFP) levels dropped
from 138 to 70 lg/L after 4 cycles of treatment and then
started to climb again after 8 cycles (107 lg/L). One
patient with hepatocellular carcinoma treated with the
level 2 dose who also had metastases to the lung had stable
disease in response to huachansu alone that lasted 8.0

Mucocutaneous toxicities

Two types of mucocutaneous toxicity were
observed: dental ulcers and rashes. A grade II dental ulcer
occurred in 1 patient a day after receipt of a level 1 dose,
but this condition resolved by 3 days later. One patient
who received a level 5 dose had a grade II rash on Day 21
that lasted 20 days; another patient given a level 2 dose

months. Four other patients had stable disease for 6, 3.5,
8, and 5.5 months, respectively (see Table 3). AFP levels
were examined in all patients.

Plasma Bufalin Determination
Table 4 shows a clear dose-dependent increase in bufalin
levels (bufalin levels in the plasma from patients given
level 1 and 2 doses were too low for detection). Although
no formal kinetics analyses were performed because of our
limited data, it was clearly shown that maximum levels of
bufalin were reached 2 hours after the infusion. Accumulation of bufalin within patients (at least in plasma) over
the dosing period was not observed, as evidenced by the
absence of detectable bufalin in samples collected 24
hours after the drug infusion. Similarly, the plasma bufalin concentration in all the samples collected on Day 14
was not higher than that at 2 hours after the first day’s
infusion, again suggesting a lack of accumulation of the
drug in plasma.

Quality of Life Outcomes
There were no significant changes over time in patients’
overall cancer-related symptoms as assessed by the
MDASI during the first cycle of treatment (baseline:
28.7  26.1; week 1: 29.8  30.8; week 2: 29.5  32.3;
week 3: 30.0  33.5; week 4: 30.3  32.3; t test for paired
data compared with baseline) and no association between
symptoms and treatment dose (data not shown).
Although there was a large variance in cancer-related

Anderson Symptom Inventory.

symptoms among patients and among patients by the
dose levels they received starting at baseline, this was
attributed to the initial extent of disease and remained relatively stable within the groups of patients by dose during
the first cycle of treatment. Not surprisingly, patients with
stable disease showed a reduction in their MDASI scores
over time, and patients with progressive disease showed an
increase in their MDASI scores over time, although the
differences between the 2 groups did not reach statistical
significance, likely because of the small sample size
(PROC MIXED procedure in SAS V9.1.3 ) (see Fig. 2).

DISCUSSION
In this trial, there were no DLTs associated with the
administration of huachansu, although we gave doses considerably higher than the conventional doses used in
China (conventional doses ¼ 20-25 mL; our highest
dose ¼ 162 mL). The grade I and II side effects that may
have been related to huachansu observed in this study
were hematologic, gastrointestinal, mucocutaneous, and
cardiovascular in nature (Table 2). These side effects did
not appear dose related, and it was unclear for many of
them whether they were genuinely related to the drug or
rather to the underlying disease. Eleven (73%) patients
had no toxicities greater than grade I. Importantly, significant cardiac toxicity was not observed despite the administration of high doses of this cardiac glycoside-containing
compound. There were also no statistically significant
changes in cancer-related symptoms associated with the
administration of huachansu. The dose was not escalated
5315

Original Article

beyond level 5 (ie, 90 mL/m2, for a total of 162 mL),
although no DLTs were detected at this high dose, as this
was already approximately 8 the dose generally used in
China (20-25 mL), and because of the observation of stable disease at the low doses that are comparable to the
dose commonly used.14
Although there were no complete or partial
responses in this study, some patients had stable disease (6
of 15 patients with a median duration of 6 months [range,
3.5-11.1 months]). Of particular note, 1 patient with hepatocellular carcinoma had a 20% reduction in tumor
mass that lasted for more than 11 months.
Several studies have suggested the potential therapeutic value of cardiac glycosides such as digoxin, oleandrin, and bufalin in the treatment of various cancers.15-21
Bufadienolides (cardiac glycosides derived from chansu),
including bufalin, cinobufagin, and epoxybufanolides,
have been found to inhibit tumor cell proliferation and
induce apoptosis in human leukemia HL-60 and U937
cells, prostate cancer PC3 and DU145 cells, and human
epidermoid carcinoma KB cells.12,13,21,22 These glycosides induce differentiation and apoptosis in a broad range
of human leukemia cell lines through alteration of expression of c-myc and bcl-2. In addition, it was found that
bufalin inhibited proliferation of human leukemia U927
cells by the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase
via a signaling pathway that included Ras, Raf-1, and
mitogen-activated protein kinase-1.23 Furthermore,
research suggests that bufalin induces cell cycle changes in
human leukemia cells by reducing levels of topoisomerase

Studies conducted in China have suggested that
huachansu can inhibit tumor cell growth and improve
immunologic function.24 Indeed, in vitro experiments
showed that huachansu suppressed the growth of various
human cancer cell lines25,26 and inhibited the proliferation of MGC-80-3 and SMMC-7721 cells by causing S
phase cell cycle arrest and inhibiting bcl-2 expression.27 In
addition, we previously found that the proliferation of
human melanoma BRO cells was inhibited by huachansu
via G2/M cell cycle arrest (unpublished observations, P.
Yang). This anticancer activity might be associated with
activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) pathway, as evidenced by increased phosphorylated of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) in
BRO cells (unpublished observations, P. Yang), suggest5316

ing that cardiac glycosides at least partially contribute to
the anticancer activity of huachansu.11 The same product
that was used in the in vitro work was used in this trial.
Furthermore, huachansu has previously been found to
markedly inhibit the biosynthesis of DNA and RNA in
H22 ascites hepatoma cells28 and was also effective in
reducing tumor volume and increasing survival in mice
bearing Lewis lung tumor cells.29 Therefore, huachansu
appears to have important antineoplastic properties that
warrant further clinical testing.
We were not able to conduct formal pharmacokinetic analyses in this trial, largely because huachansu is
not a conventional drug. Rather, it is a complex extract
containing multiple chemical components. There are few
biomarkers or specific chemical constituents that could be
used to assess pharmacokinetic parameters, and our preclinical research suggests that the antitumor activity of
huachansu can be attributed to multiple components of
the extract and not a single active principal ingredient.
This is 1 of the challenges of researching natural products.
Despite these challenges, it should be noted that the product has a uniform manufacturing process, and 3 different
lots tested had virtually identical proportions of bufalin
and fingerprints. We were able to measure, in a limited
fashion, plasma concentrations of bufalin, a known cardiac glycoside that has been reported to have anticancer
activity against multiple cancer cell lines.12,13,21,22 Bufalin
was not detected in the plasma of patients who received
level 1 and 2 doses, probably because of the relatively low
level of bufalin in the huachansu injection and the minimum detection level of 0.15 ng/mL using our assay.
Regardless, we were at least able to quantify the bufalin
levels in the patients who received dose levels 3 to 5. There
was a dose-dependent increase in bufalin levels, with maximum levels of bufalin reached 2 hours after the infusion
and no suggestion of accumulation of the drug in plasma,
which may be because of the drug’s short half-life. Given
that the patient with stable disease and 20% tumor
shrinkage was treated with the level 1 dose, there was no
clear correlation between the plasma bufalin content and
antitumor effect of huachansu. However, the small number of patients precluded making an association between
dose and response. A phase 2 clinical trial of huachansu is
currently ongoing at the Fudan University Cancer Hospital for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. This is
part of the International Center of Traditional Chinese
Cancer

Pilot Study of Huachansu/Meng et al

Medicine for Cancer funded by the National Cancer
Institute. Patients are randomized and treated with gemcitabine and huachansu (20 mL/m2) or gemcitabine and
placebo. The 20 mL/m2 dose of huachansu in that trial
was chosen based on historical use and on our finding of
the best response at the lower doses in the current trial.
We conclude the huachansu is well tolerated, even at doses
8 those normally administered in China, and that as a
single agent, it can result in disease stabilization in a subset
of patients.
