Summary
In normal cells p53 is activated by DNA damage checkpoint kinases to simultaneously control the
G1/S and G2/M cell cycle checkpoints through transcriptional induction of p21cip1 and Gadd45α.
In p53 mutant tumors, cell cycle checkpoints are rewired, leading to dependency on the p38/MK2
pathway to survive DNA-damaging chemotherapy. Here we show that the RNA binding protein
hnRNPA0 is the “successor” to p53 for checkpoint control. Like p53, hnRNPA0 is activated by a
checkpoint kinase (MK2) and simultaneously controls both cell cycle checkpoints through distinct
target mRNAs, but unlike p53 this is through the post-transcriptional stabilization of p27Kip1 and
Gadd45α mRNAs. This pathway drives cisplatin resistance in lung cancer demonstrating the
importance of post-transcriptional RNA control to chemotherapy response.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Cytotoxic chemotherapy is a mainstay of cancer treatment, yet the molecular mechanisms
that govern sensitivity or resistance to these agents in different tumor types are incompletely
understood. Many of the most commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs exert their effects by
causing DNA damage, leading to the activation of a complex signaling network that
facilitates cell cycle arrest and/or cell death. During tumor evolution, however, many, if not
all tumors disrupt components of the DNA damage response network (DDR) to escape
oncogene-induced senescence (Bartkova et al., 2006), ultimately contributing to genomic
instability. Cytotoxic anti-cancer chemotherapy works in large part by exploiting these DDR
differences between normal and tumor cells (Ciccia and Elledge, 2010; Jackson and Bartek,
2009). Some tumor types, such as testicular cancers, show a >80% response rate to
chemotherapy (Kelland, 2007). In others, such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
however, only ~30% of patients respond favorably to cytotoxic platinum-based
chemotherapy while the remaining ~70% receive little to no benefit and suffer from drugrelated toxicity (Socinski, 2004). Hence, NSCLC is an ideal system to interrogate molecular
mechanisms of intrinsic drug resistance. Importantly, the identification of chemotherapy
resistance mechanisms could, in principle, both delineate new targets for pharmacological
intervention and identify those patients most likely to benefit from specific therapeutic
regimens while limiting the extent of toxicity associated with non-selective administration.

Loss or mutation of the tumor suppressor p53 occurs in approximately 50% of all tumors
(Cheok et al., 2011). We recently demonstrated that p53-deficient cells and tumors become
dependent on the p38/MK2 pathway for survival in response to topoisomerase inhibitors or
platinum-based compounds (Morandell et al., 2013; Reinhardt et al., 2007), two classes of
commonly used chemotherapeutic agents. Those observations suggested that
pharmacological targeting of MK2, or its downstream effectors, might promote greater
clinical efficacy of chemotherapy in p53-deficient tumors (Morandell et al., 2013; Reinhardt
et al., 2007). It is also possible that the activity of this pathway could be used to predict the
efficacy of chemotherapy. However, measuring MK2 expression levels or activation status as
biomarkers of chemotherapy response is likely to be hampered by difficulties in directly

assaying MK2 activity in tumor cells, as well as the presence of high levels of MK2
expression in tumor-infiltrating stromal cells such as macrophages (Morandell et al., 2013).
A thorough mechanistic understanding of tumor-specific MK2 effectors, however, could
provide novel biomarkers that would facilitate the identification of subsets of patients most
likely to benefit from chemotherapy.

Author Manuscript

We recently found that MK2 post-transcriptionally controls the G2/M checkpoint through
the RNA binding protein (RNA-BP) hnRNPA0 promoting Gadd45α mRNA stabilization and
protein production (Reinhardt et al., 2011; 2010). In addition to loss of the G2/M
checkpoint, MK2 depleted p53-null cells also lose the DNA damage-induced G1/S
checkpoint. The molecular mechanism underlying this G1/S checkpoint bypass, the relative
contributions of different cell cycle checkpoints to chemotherapy sensitization, and the
mechanistic basis for synthetic lethality between the p53 and MK2 pathways in response to
DNA damaging chemotherapy have remained elusive.

A focused screen implicates p27Kip1 as an hnRNPA0-dependent G1/S regulator

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

As shown in Fig 1A, in addition to regulating the G2/M checkpoint, loss of hnRNPA0
results in a pronounced loss of the DNA damage-induced G1/S checkpoint in p53-null
H1299 NSCLC cells (see also Fig S1A and S1B). Depletion of Gadd45α, the only known
hnRNPA0-target mRNA involved in cell cycle control (Reinhardt et al., 2010), however,
failed to recapitulate the effect of hnRNPA0 knockdown on the G1/S checkpoint (Fig 1A,
compare orange, blue and green arrows; see also Fig S1A), indicating that hnRNPA0 must
regulate the G1/S checkpoint through a different target mRNA(s) (Fig 1B). To identify
putative hnRNPA0-target mRNAs that might control the G1/S checkpoint in these p53deficient H1299 cells, we next performed a focused mRNA expression screen following
hnRNPA0 depletion, looking for altered regulation of mRNAs whose protein products have
been implicated in regulating the G1/S transition in different contexts (Fig 1C). Based on the
assumption that hnRNPA0 regulates the stability of its target mRNAs, as has been shown for
Gadd45α (Reinhardt et al., 2010), and thus their mRNA levels, we measured the expression
of these G1/S regulators by qRT-PCR in cells depleted of hnRNPA0 by RNAi in the
presence or absence of doxorubicin-induced DNA damage. Treatment of H1299 cells with
doxorubicin led to a number of changes in the mRNA levels of several G1/S regulators,
however only one of these mRNAs, p27Kip1 appeared to be regulated in an hnRNPA0dependent manner (Fig 1C). We confirmed this effect of hnRNPA0 on p27Kip1 mRNA
induction using a second independent siRNA targeting a second distinct sequence within
hnRNPA0. This independent siRNA efficiently depleted hnRNPA0 at both the mRNA (Fig
1D) and protein level (Fig 1E) and prevented the induction of both p27Kip1 and Gadd45α
mRNAs in response to DNA damage (Fig1D). Furthermore the marked induction of p27Kip1
protein levels that we observed after doxorubicin treatment was blunted by hnRNPA0
knockdown (Fig 1E). Together these data indicate that a single RNA-binding protein,
hnRNPA0, regulates the DNA damage-induced G1/S checkpoint independently of
stabilizing Gadd45α and that this G1/S checkpoint may instead be mediated by DNA
damage-induced induction of p27Kip1.

The most well established mechanism for p27Kip1 regulation occurs at the level of protein
stability through the action of the ubiquitin ligase Skp2 (Frescas and Pagano, 2008). To
investigate whether increased protein stability could account for the up-regulation of p27Kip1
protein after DNA damage (Fig 1E) we measured p27Kip1 protein half-life after doxorubicininduced DNA damage by blocking translation with cycloheximide (Fig 1F and Fig S1B).
Surprisingly, despite a two- to threefold increase in total p27Kip1 protein levels (Fig 1E),
doxorubicin treatment led to a slight decrease in p27Kip1 protein stability (Fig 1F and S1B),
indicating that the observed induction of p27Kip1 following DNA damage does not result
from increased protein stability. Since hnRNPA0 is known to regulate Gadd45α in a DNA
damage-dependent manner through stabilization of its mRNA (Reinhardt et al., 2010), we
hypothesized that the increased p27Kip1 levels seen after DNA damage could be due to a
similar stabilization of p27Kip1 mRNA. To test this, we treated H1299 cells with doxorubicin
for 16 hr, then added actinomycin D to the culture medium to prevent new transcription and
measured p27Kip1 mRNA decay by qRT-PCR. Doxorubicin treatment led to a fourfold
increase in the half-life of p27Kip1 mRNA (Fig 1G), similar in magnitude to the observed
increase in total p27Kip1 mRNA levels (Fig 1C and 1D). Next, we set out to examine
whether the regulation of p27kip1 by hnRNPA0 is mediated by direct binding. In vitro
binding experiments with a fragment of the p27kip1 3′ UTR harboring putative hnRNPA0
binding sites (Fig S1C) (Wang et al., 2013) and the purified recombinant hnRNPA0 RNA
recognition motifs (RRMs) (Fig S1D and S1E) suggest that hnRNPA0 protein binds directly
to the p27kip1 mRNA via the 3′ UTR. Taken together, these observations suggest that the
observed up-regulation of p27Kip1 in response to DNA damage occurs primarily at the posttranscriptional level through increased mRNA stability mediated by hnRNPA0.
p27Kip1 controls the DNA damage-induced G1/S checkpoint in p53-deficient cells

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

p27Kip1 is a prototypical CDK inhibitor that binds and inhibits Cyclin A and E/CDK2 and
Cyclin D/CDK4 complexes to promote G1 arrest during entry into quiescence (Toyoshima
and Hunter, 1994). However a role for p27Kip1 in the establishment of the G1 checkpoint in
response to DNA damage has not been well described. This potential role for p27Kip1 as a
DNA damage-induced G1/S checkpoint regulator would likely be particularly important in
cells with defects or mutations in the p53 pathway since those cells lack the p21(Cip1)dependent G1/S checkpoint (see Fig 4E), and p27Kip1 and p21 perform largely overlapping
functions. To test whether this MK2/hnRNPA0/p27Kip1 pathway that we have characterized
was causally responsible for loss of the G1/S checkpoint in p53-null MK2/hnRNPA0
depleted cells, we knocked down p27Kip1 using RNAi (Fig 2A) and monitored the integrity
of the G1/S checkpoint by flow cytometry. In control RNAi-treated cells, a substantial
fraction of the population (~15-20%) remains arrested in G1 (Fig 2B, top right panel and
S2A top middle panel) 16 hr after doxorubicin treatment, but this G1 arrest was almost
completely ablated upon p27Kip1 knockdown (Fig 2B, bottom right panel and S2A bottom
middle panel). Quantification from three independent experiments revealed a near complete
loss of G1 cells in the p27Kip1 knockdown condition (Fig 2C). We confirmed that the loss of
the G1 population in p27Kip1 depleted cells was due to inappropriate progression through the
cell cycle, rather than G1-driven cell death, using EdU (5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine) labeling,
a thymidine analog that is incorporated into DNA during active synthesis in S-phase (Buck
et al., 2008) (Fig 2D). As shown in Fig 2E, DNA damage induced by1 μM doxorubicin

resulted in a 90% decrease in EdU incorporation when assayed within the 1 hour window
between 15 and 16 hr after treatment, relative to undamaged control cells (Fig 2E, black
bars; see also Fig S2C) due to implementation of G1/S and intra-S phase checkpoints.
However, depletion of p27Kip1 with either an siRNA or an shRNA targeting distinct
sequences in the p27Kip1 mRNA, resulted in a greater than 2-fold increase in EdU
incorporation at this timepoint after damage, (Fig 2E, red bars; see also Fig S2C) suggesting
that p27Kip1 depleted cells had indeed entered into S-phase due to loss of the G1/S
checkpoint (Fig 2B). Importantly, depletion of p27Kip1 had no significant effect on EdU
incorporation in the absence of DNA damage (Fig S2B). Furthermore, the magnitude of
enhanced EdU incorporation following p27Kip1 knockdown mirrored that seen with
hnRNPA0 knockdown (Fig 2E, white bars see also Fig S2C) indicating that p27Kip1 is the
major hnRNPA0-target mRNA controlling the G1/S checkpoint.

MK2-mediated phosphorylation of hnRNPA0 in response to DNA damage induces binding
to its target RNAs

Author Manuscript

Since MK2 is an important upstream regulator of hnRNPA0 function through
phosphorylation of a single residue, serine 84 (Fig 3A) (Reinhardt et al., 2010; Rousseau et
al., 2002), we next examined the role of MK2 on induction of p27Kip1 mRNA. As shown in
Figure 3B and 3C, depletion of MK2 by RNAi prevented both the DNA damage-induced
phosphorylation of serine 84 of hnRNPA0 (Fig 3B) and completely ablated p27Kip1 mRNA
induction following doxorubicin treatment (Fig 3C). This finding that p27Kip1 mRNA is
induced in an MK2 and hnRNPA0-dependent manner suggests a direct interaction between
hnRNPA0 protein and p27Kip1 mRNA (Fig S1D-E) that can be modulated by
phosphorylation of hnRNPA0 by MK2. To test this, we performed an RNA immunoprecipitation experiment using H1299 cell lines stably expressing HA-tagged WT hnRNPA0
(HA-hnRNPA0-WT), or a mutant version in which the MK2 phosphorylation site was
mutated to an alanine (HA-hnRNPA0-S84A). As shown in Fig 3D, doxorubicin-induced
DNA damage led to an eightfold increase in the association of p27Kip1 mRNA with HAhnRNPA0-WT and a fourteen fold increase in the association of Gadd45α mRNA (Fig 3D).
In contrast, mutation of the MK2 phosphorylation site in hnRNPA0 (Fig 3D, right-most
bars) completely eliminated these DNA-damage induced associations. Together with the
previous in vitro binding experiments (Fig S1D and S1E), these data indicate that p27Kip1
mRNA is stabilized in response to DNA damage through a direct interaction with hnRNPA0
in an MK2-regulated manner.
MK2 phosphorylation of hnRNPA0 promotes its cytoplasmic accumulation in response to
DNA damage

Author Manuscript

MK2 phosphorylation of serine 84 of hnRNPA0 is clearly important for its interaction with
its target mRNAs p27Kip1 and Gadd45α (Fig 3D) (Reinhardt et al., 2010) but the molecular
basis has remained elusive. Other members of the hnRNP family of RNA binding proteins
shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm under steady state conditions, but in response
to certain extracellular stimuli they can be preferentially retained in one of the two subcellular compartments (Shyu and Wilkinson, 2000). To determine whether hnRNPA0 subcellular localization was altered by DNA damage, we subjected H1299 cell lines that stably
expressing HA-hnRNPA0-WT or HA-hnRNPA0-S84A, to doxorubicin treatment, and

examined their localization by subcellular fractionation and by immunofluorescence
microscopy of intact cells. In undamaged cells, hnRNPA0 was predominantly nuclear, as
assessed by western blotting of fractionated lysates for the HA-tagged protein, lamin A (a
nuclear marker) and γ-tubulin (a cytoplasmic marker) (Fig 3E compare lanes 1 and 3). This
was further confirmed by immuofluoresence in whole cells using antibodies against the HA
tag (Fig 3F, top row). Doxorubicin-induced DNA damage led to a decrease in the nuclear
fraction of hnRNPA0 (Fig 3E, compare lanes 1 and 2) with a concomitant increase in its
cytoplasmic abundance (Fig 3E, compare lanes 3 and 4). This was further substantiated by
whole cell imaging (Fig 3F 2nd row, and Fig 3G), indicating that DNA damage induces the
cytoplasmic relocalization of hnRNPA0. Strikingly, the non-phosphorylatable HAhnRNPA0-S84A mutant displayed a similar nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution to HAhnRNPA0-WT in the basal undamaged state (Fig 3E, lanes 5 and 7), but its localization was
entirely unaltered by doxorubicin treatment (Fig 3E, compare lanes 5 and 6; Fig 3F, rows 3
and 4, and Fig 3G). Quantification of the imaging data from multiple experiments revealed a
~30% increase in cells with predominantly cytoplasmic HA-hnRNPA0-WT upon
doxorubicin treatment that was not observed in the cells expressing the HA-hnRNPA0-S84A
phospho-defective form (Fig 3G). Taken together, these biochemical and image-based data
indicate that MK2-mediated phosphorylation of hnRNPA0 leads to an increase in its
cytoplasmic localization in response to DNA damage where it is well positioned to bind to
and stabilize its target mRNAs p27Kip1 and Gadd45α.
Synthetic lethality between hnRNPA0-loss and a defective p53 pathway in response to
chemotherapy

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Since loss of hnRNPA0 abrogates both the G1 checkpoint through p27Kip1 (Fig 1 and 2) and
the G2/M checkpoint through Gadd45α (Reinhardt et al., 2010), thereby reducing the time
for DNA repair prior to the next cell cycle transition, we hypothesized that hnRNPA0depleted cells would be sensitized to killing by DNA damaging chemotherapy. To test this,
cell death was assayed by measuring cleaved caspase 3 in control or hnRNPA0-depleted
H1299 cells in response to doxorubicin-induced DNA damage. As shown in Figure 4A,
knockdown of hnRNPA0 in human p53-deficient/null H1299 cells resulted in two-fold more
cell death in response to low-dose doxorubicin as compared to control RNAi-treated cells
(Fig 4A, black vs white +Dox bars). The effect of hnRNPA0 depletion on cisplatin-induced
cell killing was even more pronounced, resulting in a fourfold increase in death compared to
the control vehicle-treated cells (Fig 4B; black vs white +Cis bars). Furthermore, we could
recapitulate these findings from human NSCLC cells with two independent shRNAs in a
genetically defined murine cell line KP7B (Fig 4C and S4A) (Doles et al., 2010) derived
from a K-RasG12D;p53−/− NSCLC tumor model (Jackson, 2005). We further confirmed that
our acute measure of cell death in response to DNA damaging chemotherapy reflected longterm survival of these cells using both colony formation assays (Fig S4B) and fluorescencelabeling based competition assays (Fig S4C and S4D). These data indicate that loss of
hnRNPA0 sensitizes p53-null cells to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy.
Many human tumors are not entirely p53-deficient (i.e. null), but instead have point
mutations in critical “hotspot” regions of this prominent tumor suppressor. To determine

hnRNPA0 loss, we knocked down hnRNPA0 by RNAi in a panel of p53-mutant and p53WT NSCLC cell lines, treated them with cisplatin, and assayed cell death (Fig 4D and S4FH). As shown in Figure 4D hnRNPA0 knockdown enhanced cisplatin-induced cell death in
all p53-mutant cell lines to varying degrees, with H2009 and H1734 cells being the most
responsive (Fig 4D first two bars). Both of these cell lines express a homozygous p53R273L
mutant protein, the most common p53 mutation found in NSCLC, accounting for >5% of all
p53 mutations (http://p53.free.fr/Database/p53_cancer/p53_Lung.html). Analysis of p53
target gene expression by qRT-PCR confirmed a largely abrogated p53 response in the p53mutant cell lines (Fig 4E). P53 mutations that functionally disable the WT protein often lead
to stabilization of p53 proteins due to loss of a p53-driven MDM2-mediated negative
feedback (Olive et al., 2004). Indeed our p53-mutant cell lines were characterized by high
basal levels of p53 that were not further stabilized upon DNA damage (Fig 4E), in marked
contrast to the WT cell lines that expressed low basal levels of p53 that was substantially
induced upon DNA damage (Fig 4E). Since not all p53 mutations disable p53 function
equivalently, it has been proposed that higher p53 protein expression can be used as a
surrogate marker for more disabling p53 mutations (Morandell et al., 2013; Reinhardt et al.,
2007; Tsao et al., 2007; Yemelyanova et al., 2011). Interestingly, we observed that basal p53
levels (as measured in Fig 4E) were highly correlated with the extent to which hnRNPA0loss induced chemo-sensitization in our cell line panel (Fig 4F, R2 = 0.8903, p = 0.016),
suggesting that p53 expression might serve as a generalizable biomarker for the extent to
which cells are dependent upon the hnRNPA0 pathway for survival following treatment with
DNA damaging chemotherapy.

Clearly both p53-null and mutant cells are sensitized to DNA damaging chemotherapy while
p53 WT cells appear be unaffected by hnRNPA0 loss. To distinguish whether this synthetic
lethal interaction between p53 loss of function and hnRNPA0 depletion was due to chronic
adaptive changes in cells with abrogated p53 responses, or an acute effect of p53 loss of
function, we then performed combination hnRNPA0/p53 knockdown experiments in p53
WT H1944 cells (Fig 4G). Depletion of hnRNPA0 alone had no demonstrable effect on
cisplatin-induced cell death in this p53-proficient cell line (Fig 4G, compare 2nd and 4th
white bars). As expected, p53 knockdown completely abrogated cisplatin-induced cell death
(Fig 4G, compare 2nd white bar and 2nd blue bar). Strikingly, combined knockdown of
hnRNPA0 on a background of p53 depletion re-sensitized these cells to cisplatin-induced
cell death (Fig 4G, compare 2nd and 4th blue bars and Fig S4H). Similar results were
obtained with Doxorubicin treatment in A549 cells, a second p53 WT cell line, upon single
and combined hnRNPA0/p53 knock-down (Fig S4I). These data suggest that targeting of
hnRNPA0 can sensitize cells that have acutely lost p53 function to DNA damaging
chemotherapy.
To address the importance of MK2 phosphorylation of hnRNPA0 in mediating cisplatin
resistance, we performed knockdown-rescue experiments with WT and mutant hnRNPA0 in
KP7B cells (Fig S4J). Endogenous hnRNPA0 was knocked-down with a retroviral shRNA
targeting the 3’ UTR followed by reconstitution with either HA-hnRNPA0-WT or HAhnRNPA0-S84A cDNA of human origin (Fig S4J, upper panel, note mobility shift due to the
2X HA-tag). These cells were then treated with cisplatin and assayed for cell death (Fig S4J,
middle panel). Knockdown of hnRNPA0 increased cell death in response to cisplatin (Fig

S4J, bottom panel, compare 2nd black bar and 2nd white bar) while re-expression of HAhnRNPA0-WT completely abrogated this effect (Fig S4J, bottom panel, compare 2nd white
bar to 4th white bar). In stark contrast, re-expression of HA-hnRNPA0-S84A failed to rescue
the hnRNPA0 knockdown phenotype (Fig S4J, bottom panel, compare 2nd white bar and 6th
white bar). These data suggest that phosphorylation of hnRNPA0 is not only required for its
interaction with target mRNAs, but also required for cells to resist killing by chemotherapy,
potentially due to a requirement for damage-induced hnRNPA0 cytoplasmic localization
(Fig 3).
Reduced hnRNPA0 activity promotes cisplatin efficacy in vivo in a murine p53-deficient
NSCLC model

Author Manuscript

To determine whether hnRNPA0 promotes resistance of established lung tumors to cisplatinbased chemotherapy in vivo we took advantage of a transplantable model of NSCLC (Doles
et al., 2010; Morandell et al., 2013). In this model, KP7B cells are transplanted in syngeneic,
immune-competent recipient mice (Fig 5A) (Doles et al., 2010). The advantages of this
model over a traditional xenograft approach are threefold: First, tumors arising in recipient
mice are pathologically and molecularly indistinguishable from the tumors from which they
were derived (Doles et al., 2010), which are themselves strikingly similar to their human
counterparts (Jackson, 2005; Sweet-Cordero et al., 2004). Second, the cells give rise to
tumors in the correct anatomical location in the presence of a fully functional host immune
system. Lastly, and most importantly for our studies, this model is highly tractable and
allows genetic manipulation of proteins of interest prior to transplantation.

We generated stable KP7B cell lines by introduction of an hnRNPA0-specific shRNA that
efficiently knocked down its intended target (Fig S5A), along with a retrovirus expressing
luciferase to facilitate imaging of response to therapy (Fig 5A). These cell lines were then
transplanted into multiple syngeneic recipient mice, and tumors were allowed to form until
strong bioluminescence was observed in the lungs of all animals (16 days posttransplantation) in order to assess therapeutic response in established tumors. While no
significant difference in bioluminescence was observed between control and hnRNPA0depleted tumors in the absence of DNA damaging chemotherapy (Fig 5B-C and Fig S5B,
pre-treatment condition), upon treatment with cisplatin, control tumors continued to grow
rapidly but growth of hnRNPA0-depleted tumors was markedly suppressed (Fig 5B-C).
MicroCT imaging of a second cohort of animals treated with a single high dose of cisplatin
(10 mg/Kg) confirmed the superior response of hnRNPA0-depleted tumors to chemotherapy
(Fig S5B and S5C-D). Consistent with the short term tumor response data, mice transplanted
with hnRNPA0-proficient cells obtained no significant survival benefit from cisplatin
treatment (Fig 5D, compare red and blue lines, p=0.52) indicating that tumors in this model
are entirely recalcitrant to cisplatin-based chemotherapy (Doles et al., 2010). In contrast,
animals transplanted with hnRNPA0-depleted tumors displayed a significant survival benefit
upon cisplatin treatment (Fig 5E, compare red and blue lines, p<0.0001) indicating that the
acute tumor growth effect we observed in response to therapy (Fig 5B-C) directly translated
into an extension of lifespan in this murine NSCLC model (Fig 5D-E). Taken together, these
data indicate that the presence of hnRNPA0 promotes resistance of established lung tumors
to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in vivo.

hnRNPA0 promotes resistance to chemotherapy through stabilization of p27Kip1 and
Gadd45α mRNAs

Author Manuscript

Our data demonstrate that in response to DNA damaging chemotherapy, MK2-mediated
phosphorylation of hnRNPA0 stabilizes the mRNAs of p27Kip1 and Gadd45α to control the
G1/S and G2/M checkpoints, respectively (Fig 6A). However, the relative contributions
provided by either of these two target mRNAs to the overall enhanced chemo-sensitivity of
hnRNPA0 knockdown cells/tumors (Fig 4-5) is unknown. To determine this, we depleted
p53-null H1299 cells of either p27Kip1 alone, Gadd45α alone, or both RNAs simultaneously.
The isolated or combined knockdown of p27Kip1 and Gadd45α had no significant effect on
untreated cells, indicating that loss of these two proteins is not acutely toxic to cells in the
absence of DNA damage (Fig 6B and S6A-B). Knockdown of either of these hnRNPA0target mRNAs individually had no effect on cell death in response to cisplatin (Fig 6B, red
and blue bars compared to the black bars) or doxorubicin (Fig S6B). Strikingly, however, codepletion of both hnRNPA0-target mRNAs resulted in a markedly enhanced amount of cell
death, and fully recapitulated the effect of hnRNPA0 knockdown on response to cisplatin
(Fig 6B, compare white bars and purple bars) and doxorubicin (Fig S6B). Taken together,
these data indicate that MK2/hnRNPA0 promotes the resistance of p53-defective cells to
chemotherapy by the combined action of stabilizing both p27Kip1 and Gadd45α mRNAs to
control the G1/S and G2/M checkpoints, respectively.
Reduced levels of hnRNPA0-target mRNAs correlate with favorable response to adjuvant

The observation that the MK2/hnRNPA0 pathway promotes resistance to chemotherapy in
NSCLC models through the coordinate post-transcriptional control of the p27Kip1 and
Gadd45α regulated DNA damage G1/S and G2/M checkpoints suggests that human tumors
with low levels of activity through this pathway, either by means of natural heterogeneity or
pharmacological intervention, might be more likely to respond to cisplatin-based
chemotherapy. To test this, we made use of data from the NCIC CTG JBR10 clinical trial in
which stage 1B and 2 NSCLC patients had their tumors surgically resected and were then
either observed or given cisplatin/vinorelbine adjuvant chemotherapy (Winton et al., 2005).
This dataset was selected for analysis for several reasons. First, banked snap-frozen tumors
from a subset of patients were subjected to gene expression profiling prior to therapy, thus
facilitating identification of genetic determinants of therapeutic response (Zhu et al., 2010).
Second, this trial had a control/observation arm thus allowing for factors that regulate
response to therapy (predictive markers) to be differentiated from those that affect tumor
growth per se (prognostic markers). Unsupervised clustering on p27Kip1 and Gadd45α
expressions was used as a surrogate for assessing activity through the MK2/hnRNPA0
pathway and two distinctive clusters were identified (Fig S6C); one cluster with high
expression of p27Kip1 and Gadd45α and the other with low expression. We focused our
analysis on stage 2 patients (Table 1) as adjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to be
beneficial mainly in this subset of early stage patients (Winton et al., 2005). As shown in
Figure 6C, patients with high expression of p27Kip1 and Gadd45α did not benefit from
adjuvant chemotherapy (Fig 6C, compare orange and green lines, HR 1.48, 95%CI
0.47-4.67, p=0.502). Whereas, patients with low levels of these hnRNPA0-target mRNAs
received significant benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy (Fig 6D, compare orange and green

lines, HR 0.23 95%CI 0.07-0.71 p=0.011). Importantly, patients in the observation arm of
the trial whose tumors express low levels of p27Kip1 and Gadd45α appeared to show the
poorest survival of all groups analyzed (Fig 6D, orange line) similar to mice harboring
hnRNPA0-depleted tumors (Fig 5D and 5E, compare blue line in 5D to the blue line in 5E,
p=0.0023). Moreover, only consideration of both p27kip1 and Gadd45α expression together,
but neither alone, had a significant association with therapeutic response (Fig S6D). Since
our data from a panel of NSCLC cell lines indicated that high basal p53 protein levels
correlated with superior response to hnRNPA0 knockdown-induced chemo-sensitization
(Fig 4D-F), we further stratified patients based upon p53 immuno-histochemistry status: p53
IHC positive/putatively mutant and p53 IHC negative/putatively WT (Tsao et al., 2007).
While the number of patients is very small, the data suggests that patients whose tumors
express low levels of p27Kip1 and Gadd45α, and additionally have stabilizing p53 mutations,
benefit most from adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy (Fig S6E-F). Taken together, these
murine (Fig 5) and human clinical data (Fig 6 and S6) indicate that hnRNPA0 promotes
resistance to chemotherapy in p53-mutant NSCLC through p27Kip1 and Gadd45α (Fig 6A).
Mutual exclusivity of the p53 and MK2/hnRNPA0 pathways is ensured by p53/p21-mediated
suppression of hnRNPA0

Author Manuscript

To ascertain the molecular basis for the p53 context-dependence of hnRNPA0 for DNA
damage tolerance, we next investigated whether there is a regulatory relationship between
p53 and hnRNPA0. We noted than when p53 proficient cells were treated with doxorubicin,
a marked suppression of hnRNPA0 protein levels was observed (Fig 7A, compare lanes 1
and 2 and first two black bars), that was not seen in p53-null cells (see Fig 1E). To examine
whether this reduction in hnRNPA0 required p53, we knocked-down p53 with siRNA,
treated the cells with doxorubicin, and measured hnRNPA0 protein levels. The pronounced
decrease in hnRNPA0 following DNA damage that we observed previously was largely
ablated upon p53 knockdown (Fig 7A) suggesting that p53 or its downstream effectors
actively suppresses hnRNPA0. Conversely, activation of p53 even in the absence of DNA
damage was sufficient to suppress hnRNPA0. In these experiments treatment of A549 cells
with the MDM2 inhibitor Nultin 3a to upregulate p53 resulted in down-regulation of
hnRNPA0 protein and mRNA in control siRNA transfected cells (Fig 7B, left and right
lower panels, black bars), but not in p53-depleted cells (Fig 7B, red bars). These findings
suggest that the drop in hnRNPA0 protein levels is likely a consequence of decreased mRNA
levels, either due to decreased transcription, or to post-transcriptional destabilization of the
hnRNPA0 mRNA.

Author Manuscript

Since many RNA binding proteins are auto-regulated or regulated by other RNA-BPs at the
post-transcriptional level, and the hnRNPA0 3′ UTR is long and highly conserved (Fig S7A)
we first examined whether hnRNPA0 mRNA was destabilized upon p53 activation. To test
this we measured hnRNPA0 mRNA stability in Nutlin 3a-treated cells in the same manner as
we had assessed p27kip1 stability in response to doxorubicin (Fig 1G). As shown in Figure
7C, the half-life of hnRNPA0 mRNA dropped from ~16 hr in vehicle treated cells to ~6 hr
following p53 activation with Nutlin 3a. Moreover, half-life estimates averaged from
multiple experiments revealed a ~50% decrease in hnRNPA0 mRNA half-life upon p53
activation (Fig 7D), closely mirroring the drop seen in total hnRNPA0 mRNA levels (Fig

7B, right panel, black bars). Since p21 is the primary effector of p53-mediated G1/S
checkpoint control, we next asked whether suppression of the hnRNPA0 successor pathway
was p21-dependent. We knocked down p21 using siRNA in A549 cells, treated them with
Nutlin 3a to activate p53 (Fig 7E, left panel) and measured hnRNPA0 protein and mRNA
levels. Indeed, the repression of hnRNPA0 mRNA (Fig 7E, right panel) and hnRNPA0
protein (Fig S7B) was largely ablated by depletion of p21. While the precise molecular basis
for this p21-dependent hnRNPA0 mRNA destabilization remains to be determined, these
findings clearly point to an important role for p21 induction in suppression of hnRNPA0
expression. These data suggest that rather than functioning in parallel pathways, the primary
p53/p21 and the successor MK2/hnRNPA0 pathways of cell cycle checkpoint control are
mutually exclusive, and that this is ensured by suppression of the successor pathway at the
level of hnRNPA0 mRNA destabilization (Fig 7F).

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Post-transcriptional control of gene expression is becoming increasingly appreciated as a
target of the DNA damage response (DDR). Several unbiased screens have implicated RNA
binding proteins (RNA-BPs) as one of the most enriched classes of genes involved in
activating and modulating the DDR (Beli et al., 2012; Matsuoka et al., 2007; Paulsen et al.,
2009; Reinhardt et al., 2010). To date, however, there are few examples of RNA-BPs that
have been implicated as functionally important in the execution of specific cellular decisions
in response to DNA damage, or had their relevant target RNAs interrogated in this regard
(Abdelmohsen et al., 2007). Here we have shown that the RNA-BP hnRNPA0 is a major
substrate of the checkpoint kinase MK2, and that it enforces cell cycle arrest and promotes
resistance to DNA damaging chemotherapy through two distinct target mRNAs that
respectively control the G1/S and G2/M DNA damage checkpoints in cultured cells and in
vivo. These findings indicate that in addition to modulating the DDR itself, RNA-BPs are
intimately involved in critical life and death decisions. More broadly, recent advances in the
high-throughput identification of RNA-protein interactions, such as High Throughput
Sequencing CrossLink Immuno-Precipitation (HITS-CLIP) (Darnell, 2010), should help to
elucidate the role of other RNA-BPs identified in recent screening approaches and may shed
light on the breadth and extent of post-transcriptional control of gene expression in the
context of the DDR.

Our work demonstrates that hnRNPA0 regulates p27kip1 expression in a context-specific
manner in response to DNA damaging chemotherapy and complements a growing body of
literature documenting the critical contribution of post-transcriptional control by multiple
regulators (e.g. miR-221, DND1 and Pumillio) to p27kip1 expression (Kedde et al., 2007;
2010). The binding of hnRNPA0 to p27kip1 mRNA appears to occur via the 3′ UTR but in a
region that is distinct from that of miR-221, DND1 or Pumillio (Kedde et al., 2007; 2010).
Together these data indicate that the p27kip1 3′ UTR acts as a platform for different posttranscriptional regulators dependent upon the extra-cellular cues (e.g. growth factors, DNA
damage etc) and genetic context (e.g. p53 mutation) in which a specific cell exists.
MK2 activation of cell cycle checkpoints in p53-compromised cells promotes resistance to
doxorubicin or cisplatin-based chemotherapy, raising the possibility that targeting this

pathway in human tumors may preferentially kill p53-mutant tumor cells while sparing p53WT normal cells (Morandell et al., 2013; Reinhardt et al., 2007). MK2 controls the G2/M
checkpoint by regulating the activity of the RNA-BP hnRNPA0 and causing stabilization of
Gadd45α mRNA (Reinhardt et al., 2010). Here we have shown that, in addition to regulation
of the G2/M checkpoint, hnRNPA0 also enforces a G1/S checkpoint through stabilization of
p27Kip1 mRNA. Traditionally p27Kip1 is regarded as the major CDK inhibitor that induces
G1 arrest upon contact inhibition or during terminal differentiation (Hsieh et al., 2000;
Polyak et al., 1994) but a role for p27Kip1 in control of the DNA damage checkpoints has
largely been overlooked with two notable exceptions (Cuadrado et al., 2009; Liontos et al.,
2010). Our data clearly implicate p27Kip1 as the major controller of the G1/S checkpoint
following DNA damage in p53-null cells. Interestingly, a previous report implicated p27Kip1
in long-term maintenance of cell cycle arrest in p53-WT A549 cells after long-term
exposure to doxorubicin (Cuadrado et al., 2009). In that study p27Kip1 was only important
for controlling the G1/S checkpoint once the initial wave of p53-p21 activity had diminished
(Cuadrado et al., 2009). In agreement with these observations, we show that in those same
p53-WT A549 cells acute (24 hr) activation of p53 by doxorubicin or MDM2 inhibition
suffices to down regulate hnRNPA0 in a p53/p21-dependent manner. These data support a
mutual exclusivity model where p27Kip1 control of the G1/S checkpoint only becomes
essential in cells that do not have an active p53-p21 pathway and thus fail to suppress
hnRNPA0 (Fig 7F). Interestingly, Gadd45α is a transcriptional target of p53 in response to
DNA damage, but in p53-null cells is induced by the MK2/hnRNPA0-dependent
stabilization of its mRNA. Therefore, Gadd45α control of the G2/M checkpoint is
functionally maintained in the absence of p53 by a switch from transcriptional to posttranscriptional control (Fig 7F). Together these data indicate that hnRNPA0 is the
“successor” to p53 for checkpoint control in response to DNA damaging chemotherapy and
that a mechanistic switch from transcriptional control of p21 and Gadd45α to posttranscriptional control of p27Kip1 and Gadd45α enforces the G1/S and G2/M checkpoints
and drives chemo-resistance (Fig 7F).

Intrinsic drug resistance is a major obstacle to the successful treatment of human
malignancies. Some patients receive significant benefit from cytotoxic DNA-damaging
chemotherapy but identifying these patients a priori is a significant challenge (Kelland,
2007). Here, we have shown that p53-null/mutant NSCLCs rely on an MK2/hnRNPA0/
p27Kip1/Gadd45α pathway to promote cell cycle arrest and resist killing by chemotherapy.
In light of our findings in tumor cell lines and animal models, we investigated whether the
status of this pathway correlated with therapeutic response in NSCLC patients. Consistent
with our experimental data, we observed that stage 2 NSCLC patients with low levels of
hnRNPA0-target mRNAs received significant benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy after
surgical resection that was exacerbated still further when analyzing patients with p53-mutant
tumors, while those with high levels of MK2/hnRNPA0-target mRNAs did not. While our
findings in this well-annotated small patient cohort will require independent large scale
verification, our data suggests that the use of p27Kip1 and Gadd45α mRNA levels in
combination with p53 IHC as predictive “biomarkers” could identify a subset of patients at
diagnosis that are most likely to benefit from platinum-based chemotherapy. Our data
therefore highlight a critically important unifying role for the cytoplasmic MK2/hnRNPA0

p53-successor pathway in dictating tumor response to therapy in NSCLC through posttranscriptional control of two distinct cell cycle checkpoints (Fig 7F).

Experimental Procedures
RNA-IP and qRT-PCR

Author Manuscript

RNA-IPs were performed as described previously (Reinhardt et al., 2010) with the addition
of 4-thiouridine (4SU) labeling prior to drug treatment. Briefly, H1299 cells expressing HAhnRNPA0 were treated with 100 mM 4SU for 24 hr, followed by treatment with 2 uM
doxorubicin for 16 hr. At the end of doxorubicin treatment cells were washed once in icecold PBS and crosslinked at 365 nm as described (Hafner et al., 2010). Cells were then
scraped in ice-cold PBS and RNA-IP performed as described previously (Keene et al., 2006;
Reinhardt et al., 2010) using HA-agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich). For qRT-PCR analysis
RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's
instructions and 1 g of total RNA was used for reverse transcription using the superscript III
first-strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen) and oligo-dT priming as per the manufacturer's
instructions. For qPCR cDNA was amplified using SYBR green PCR mastermix (Applied
Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's cycling conditions for 40 cycles on a Bio-Rad
C1000 Thermal Cycler. Data were analyzed using the delta-delta Ct method as described
previously (Cannell et al., 2010) and plotted as fold change versus control.

50,000 KP7B cells, labeled with GFP-Luciferase, were transplanted into 10-12 week old
syngeneic C57BL6/Jx129-JAE male recipient mice 6 hr after 5 Gy whole body irradiation as
described previously (Doles et al., 2010). Tumors were allowed to form for approx. 2 weeks
and tumor growth was measured by microCT imaging on a eXplore CT120-whole mouse
MicroCT (GE Healthcare) (45- m resolution, 80 kV, with 450- A current) as described
previously (Doles et al., 2010) or bio-luminescent imaging on a IVIS Spectrumbioluminescent and fluorescent imaging system (Xenogen Corporation). For all imaging
procedures animals were pre-anesthesized with isoflourane. For drug treatments, cisplatin
was dissolved in saline and injected IP at 10 mg/kg for single high dose treatment, or with 7
mg/kg once weekly for a total of three weeks for low dose treatment. Mice were sacrificed
when moribund or when they had lost 20% of their initial body weight, whichever occurred
sooner, according to MIT Committee on Animal Care guidelines. All mouse studies were
approved by the MIT Institutional Committee for Animal Care (CAC), and conducted in
compliance with the Animal Welfare Act Regulations and other federal statutes relating to
animals and experiments involving animals and adheres to the principles set forth in the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, National Research Council, 1996
(Institutional Animal Welfare Assurance no. A-3125–01).

follow-up information was also obtained after Research Ethics Board approval for chart
reviews. Expression of p27Kip1 and Gadd45α mRNAs in 133 non-small cell lung cancer
samples profiled by using Affymetrix U133A (Zhu et al., 2010) represented by probe set
209112_at and 203725_at, respectively. Two clusters were identified based on the
expressions of p27Kip1 and Gadd45α using hierarchal clustering (Sturn et al., 2002). The 2
clusters were defined as low and high expressed groups based on the expression of these two
genes (Fig S6C). For survival analysis, lung cancer specific survival was used as the survival
endpoint and Cox proportional hazards regression (SAS v9.3, SAS Institute Inc, Cary) was
used to estimate the hazard ratio and test the significance. A p value of less than 0.05 was
considered as significant. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining and scoring for p53 protein
on tissue microarray (TMA) was described in detail in (Tsao et al., 2007). Briefly, 4μm
sections from TMA were mounted onto slides. DO7 antibody for p53 (NovoCastra
Laboratories, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom) was diluted at 1:200 and applied to
the sample which were microwave heated for antigen retrieval. The dilution was optimized a
priori to ensure that there was no stain on normal tissue. Staining intensity was qualitatively
scored from 0 (absent) to 3 (strong), and the percentage of tumor cells with nuclear staining
was estimated. A sample with more than 15% cells with intensity scored 1 and above was
defined as IHC positive.
Statistical Analysis—Unless otherwise, specified, all p values were calculated using a
two-tailed student's T-Test in Graphpad Prism.

Significance
Platinum-containing regimens are frontline DNA damaging therapies for non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC), yet the molecular mechanisms that drive resistance to
chemotherapy are incompletely understood. Here we show that NSCLC tumors with
mutations in p53 (~50%) are critically dependent on the activity of a post-transcriptional
MK2/hnRNPA0 pathway for resistance to chemotherapy. hnRNPA0 regulates both
p27Kip1 and Gadd45α to enforce cell cycle checkpoints, allowing DNA repair and
tolerance to chemotherapy. Analysis of hnRNPA0-target mRNAs in NSCLC patients
demonstrates that activity of this pathway correlates with therapeutic response. Thus, prescreening of patients for the activity of the MK2/hnRNPA0 pathway may predict a subpopulation of patients likely to benefit most from chemotherapy.
