is thought to be an active participant in the process of cancer
initiation, progression, and metastasis (2, 3). In many solid tumors,
the stroma is increasingly recognized to be important in promoting
tumor proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and chemoresistance
(2, 4). However, despite the abundant desmoplastic reaction that
is a hallmark of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, the role of tumorassociated stroma in pancreatic cancer is not well described.
Pancreatic stellate cells are myofibroblast-like cells that were
originally identified as the source of the fibrosis in chronic pancreatitis (5) and are now thought to be responsible for the dense
stroma associated with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (6). Pancreatic
stellate cells are similar to hepatic stellate cells, which are important effector cells in hepatic fibrosis (7–9). Both pancreatic and
hepatic stellate cells stain positive for vimentin, desmin, and a
smooth muscle actin (aSMA) and contain vitamin A–storing lipid
droplets in the cytoplasm, indicating that they are neither fibroblasts nor smooth muscle cells (5). The precise role of pancreatic
stellate cells in tumor-stroma interactions in pancreatic cancer
has not been well defined, in part because of the difficulty in obtaining primary HPSCs in sufficient quantities for study. Once
isolated, HPSCs can only be passaged for a limited number of times
before undergoing senescence. Most studies using pancreatic
stellate cells have used cells isolated from rats (10, 11), with
relatively few studies using primary HPSCs from pancreatic cancer
(12, 13). Detailed characterization of the role of pancreatic stellate
cells in human pancreatic cancer progression would provide a
set of potential targets for stromal-directed therapy. In addition,
pancreatic cancer–associated stromal factors may also serve as
tumor biomarkers and possible targets for cancer prevention.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of
primary HPSCs on pancreatic tumor progression and response to
therapy in vitro and in an orthotopic model of pancreatic cancer.
For this purpose, we isolated human adenocarcinoma-associated
pancreatic stellate cells from resected surgical specimens. These
cells were immortalized and examined for their influence on
pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. We found that the
stellate cells had several effects that promoted the progression
of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

Abstract
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is characterized by a dense background of tumor associated stroma originating from abundant pancreatic stellate cells. The aim of this study was to
determine the effect of human pancreatic stellate cells (HPSC)
on pancreatic tumor progression. HPSCs were isolated from
resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma samples and immortalized with telomerase and SV40 large T antigen. Effects of HPSC
conditioned medium (HPSC-CM) on in vitro proliferation,
migration, invasion, soft-agar colony formation, and survival
in the presence of gemcitabine or radiation therapy were
measured in two pancreatic cancer cell lines. The effects of
HPSCs on tumors were examined in an orthotopic murine
model of pancreatic cancer by co-injecting them with
cancer cells and analyzing growth and metastasis. HPSC-CM
dose-dependently increased BxPC3 and Panc1 tumor cell
proliferation, migration, invasion, and colony formation.
Furthermore, gemcitabine and radiation therapy were less
effective in tumor cells treated with HPSC-CM. HPSC-CM activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt pathways
in tumor cells. Co-injection of tumor cells with HPSCs in an
orthotopic model resulted in increased primary tumor
incidence, size, and metastasis, which corresponded with the
proportion of HPSCs. HPSCs produce soluble factors that
stimulate signaling pathways related to proliferation
and survival of pancreatic cancer cells, and the presence
of HPSCs in tumors increases the growth and metastasis of
these cells. These data indicate that stellate cells have an
important role in supporting and promoting pancreatic cancer. Identification of HPSC-derived factors may lead to novel
stroma-targeted therapies for pancreatic cancer. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is characterized by a highly
malignant phenotype resistant to currently available systemic
therapies; incidence rates are nearly equal to mortality rates (1).
The extremely dense desmoplastic infiltration that is characteristic
of pancreatic adenocarcinoma is unique among solid tumors, and
may impede effective systemic treatments on a molecular level.
Importantly, in many tumor types, the local microenvironment

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. BxPC3 and Panc1 pancreatic tumor cells were obtained
from American Type Culture Collection. Tumor cells were cultured in
DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 10% FCS with 2 mmol/L glutamine and
penicillin/streptomycin (both from Invitrogen) at 37jC in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2.
Human pancreatic stellate cells (HPSC) were prepared by the outgrowth
method (12). Fresh tissue was obtained from residual pancreatic adenocarcinoma specimens from patients undergoing primary surgical resection
at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. All human

DMEM/10% FCS. The media were changed to serum-free DMEM and cells
were cultured for 48 h. Media were collected, centrifuged at 1,000  g for
10 min, and the supernatant was concentrated with Centricon YM3 filters
(Millipore). Protein content of the concentrated HPSC conditioned media
(HPSC-CM) was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and
aliquots were stored at 80jC until use. For all functional assays using
HPSC-CM, conditioned media from immortalized and nonimmortalized
HPSCs were used and produced similar results.
Proliferation assay. BxPC3 and Panc1 cells were seeded at 3,000 per
well in 96-well plates and cultured in DMEM/10% FCS. Medium was
changed to serum-free DMEM for overnight incubation. Concentrated
HPSC-CM was added to cells at varying concentrations (0.1, 0.25, 0.5,
1.0 Ag/AL); serum-free DMEM was added to control wells. Cell growth
was analyzed at 24, 48, and 72 h with the MTS reagent (Promega) added
1 h before taking the spectrophotometric reading, according to the
manufacturer’s directions.
Invasion assays. For studies of cell invasiveness, BioCoat Matrigelcoated invasion chambers (BD Biosciences) were used. Briefly, 2  104
BxPC3 or Panc1 cells in 500-AL serum-free medium were added to the
upper chamber. Medium containing 10% FCS or concentrated HPSC-CM
(0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 Ag/AL) was added into the lower chamber. Serum-free
medium was added to the lower chamber of control wells. The cells were
allowed to invade the Matrigel for 48 h at 37jC in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.
The noninvading cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed
with a cotton swab. Cells were fixed in methanol, stained with hematoxylin,
and air-dried. Invading cells in three adjacent microscope fields for each
membrane were counted at 20 magnification.
Soft-agar colony formation. BxPC3 or Panc1 cells were plated in
24-well plates (104 per well) with 0.3% agar on a 0.6% agar (Noble agar,
Becton Dickinson) underlayer containing HPSC-CM, serum-free medium, or
DMEM containing 10% FCS. HPSC-CM was replenished daily on the top
layer. Cells were cultured for 15 days and colonies were counted in 10
random fields per well.

samples were obtained in accordance with the policies and practices of the
Institutional Review Board of The University of Texas M. D. Anderson
Cancer Center. Briefly, tumor samples were minced and seeded in six-well
plates containing 15% FCS/DMEM, L-glutamine (2 mmol/L), penicillin/
streptomycin, and amphotericin. After f5 days, cells were able to grow out
from the tissue clumps. Medium was changed every 3 days. All cells were
maintained at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. When HPSCs
grew to confluence, cells were trypsinized and passaged 1:3.
Cell purity was determined by immunohistochemistry for aSMA,
vimentin, and desmin, as well as morphology (spindle-shaped cells with
cytoplasmic extensions) and positive staining with Oil Red O (lipid
inclusions were visualized). Antibodies used were antihuman aSMA (clone
1A4), anti-vimentin (clone V9), and antihuman desmin (clone D33; all from
DAKO). For the assays using nonimmortalized primary HPSCs, passage
numbers 5 to 12 were used.
HPSCs were immortalized using a HPSC line derived from the pancreatic
tumor of a patient who had received no prior therapy before surgery.
Lentiviral vectors with human telomerase (hTERT) or SV40 large T antigen
(TAg) were produced by transfection of 293 cells. Plasmids containing
TAg (pHIV7-CNPO-TAg) and hTERT (pHIV7-CNPO-hTERT) have been
described in detail (14) and were kindly provided by Dr. Jiing-Kuan Yee
(City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA). After 48 h, viral
supernatant was collected and added to HPSCs. HPSCs carrying the hTERT
or SV40-T were selected in 1 to 3 mg/mL G418 for 3 weeks (Invitrogen). The
presence of SV40-T was confirmed by Western blotting (Santa Cruz
Biotech). Expression of aSMA and vimentin was confirmed as described
above (Fig. 1). To quantify growth rate, cells were grown in six-well plates
and counted every 2 days. Doubling time was calculated as (0.301  Dt) /
(log10 N/N 0), where Dt represents the difference in time, measured in hours,
and N 0 and N represent the number of cells at the initial and end time
points.
Preparation of conditioned media. HPSCs, both primary and
immortalized, were grown to 70% to 80% confluence in 20-cm2 dishes in

Western blot analysis. To evaluate activation of the mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt pathways in the presence of HPSC-CM,
BxPC3 cells were grown in six-well plates in 10% DMEM to 70% confluency,
serum starved overnight, and treated with HPSC-CM (1 Ag/AL) for 0 to 120
min. Cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed. Cell lysates were prepared
and separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes
were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 5% nonfat milk in 0.1% Tween,
washed, and incubated overnight at 4jC with one of the following antibodies:
total p44/42, phospho p44/42 (Thr202/Tyr204), Akt, or phospho Akt (Ser473), all
from Cell Signaling Technology. Immunodetection was done with the
corresponding secondary Alexa Fluor 680–conjugated antibodies. Fluorescence was detected with the Odyssey fluorescent imager (Li-Cor Biosciences).
Response to chemotherapy and radiation treatment. BxPC3 cells
were seeded in eight-well chamber slides (1  105 per well) in DMEM with
10% FCS. After incubation overnight, cells were washed and medium was
changed to DMEM + 10% FCS, with or without HPSC-CM (1 Ag/AL). Cells
were treated with either 100 Amol/L gemcitabine (Eli Lilly) or vehicle alone.
After 48 h, apoptotic cells were analyzed with the terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay
(ApopTag, Chemicon) and nuclei were stained with 4¶,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI). Cells were counted using Simple PCI software
(Compix, Inc.). The ratio of apoptotic cells was calculated as (number of
cells positive for TUNEL / number of nuclei stained with DAPI)  100.
Experiments were done in duplicate and 10 random fields were counted for
each condition.
The effect of HPSC-CM on tumor cell response to radiation was done in a
similar fashion. After addition of HPSC-CM (or DMEM with 10% FCS for
control wells), cells were exposed to either 0 or 100 Gy of ionizing radiation.
After 24-h incubation, caspase activation was detected using Magic Red kit
(Immunochemistry Technologies, Inc.) and cell nuclei were stained with
DAPI. The percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis and the total number of
nuclei were counted using Simple PCI software (Compix, Inc.). Experiments
were done in duplicate and 10 random fields were counted for each
condition.
Orthotopic model of pancreatic cancer. All animal experiments were
reviewed and approved by the University of Texas M. D. Anderson
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. An orthotopic nude mouse
model of pancreatic cancer using BxPC3 pancreatic tumor cells labeled with
firefly luciferase (BxPC3-FL) has previously been described by this lab (15).
All mice were divided into groups receiving intrapancreatic injections of (a)
BxPC3-FL alone, either 0.5  106 or 1  106 per mouse; (b) BxPC3-FL with
immortalized HPSCs, in varying tumor-to-stroma ratios (1:1, 1:1, or 1:5); or
(c) immortalized HPSCs alone (0.5  106 or 1  106). All cell suspensions,
including the mixtures of BxPC3 and HPSCs, were injected in a 50-AL
volume of HBSS. Bioluminescent imaging was done weekly to follow the
luciferase signal from BxPC3 cells. Mice were sacrificed and tumors were
harvested and measured.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was done using GraphPad
Prism (GraphPad). Comparisons were made using two-tailed Student’s
t test and significant difference was defined as P < 0.05. Data are shown as
mean F SE.

with either SV40 Tag alone or both hTERT and SV40-TAg was
not significantly different compared with nonimmortalized HPSCs
(data not shown).
Conditioned medium from HPSCs stimulates pancreatic
tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and colony formation in
soft agar. The addition of conditioned medium from immortalized
HPSCs (expressing SV40 Tag and hTERT) to BxPC3 cells induced an
increase in tumor cell proliferation compared with serum-free
medium controls (Fig. 2A). The effect was dose dependent and a
significant increase in proliferation compared with serum-free
medium control wells was observed at 0.5 Ag/AL (301.7% of control
F 43.1%; P < 0.005). Cell proliferation with the highest dose of
HPSC-CM (1 Ag/AL) was equivalent to medium containing 10%
FCS. Panc1 cells were more sensitive to HPSC-CM because a
significant increase in proliferation was observed with amounts as
low as 0.25 Ag/AL in a dose-dependent fashion. Maximal effects of
HPSC-CM on Panc1 cell proliferation were similar to those
observed in BxPC3 cells and again were equal to the effects of
10% FCS (Fig. 2A).
HPSC-CM also induced a dose-dependent increase in BxPC3 and
Panc1 cell migration and invasion (Fig. 2B; data on cell migration
not shown). BxPC3 invasion was induced with as little as
0.1 Ag/AL HPSC-CM [3.4 F 1.78 versus 0.4 F 0.51; P < 0.0001].
Stimulation of BxPC3 invasion increased with the dose of HPSCCM to a maximum of 21.5 F 6.2. HPSC-CM induced an even greater
increase in cell migration of Panc1 cells than BxPC3, similar to its
effects on cell proliferation. The minimum dose of 0.1 Ag/AL HPSCCM stimulated a 19-fold increase in Panc1 invasion compared with
serum-free medium (P < 0.0001). The maximum dose of 1.0 Ag/AL
HPSC-CM resulted in Panc1 invasion at a higher level than medium
containing 10% FCS (48 F 15 versus 28.3 F 3.4; P < 0.001).
To determine whether secreted factors from stromal fibroblasts
affect anchorage-independent growth of tumor cells, soft-agar
colony formation assay was done in the presence or absence of
HPSC-CM. With the addition of HPSC-CM, BxPC3 cells formed
more colonies in soft agar compared with serum-free medium
control (Fig. 2C; 146.7 F 7.6 for 0.5 Ag/AL HPSC-CM, 178.7 F 13.6
for 1 Ag/AL HPSC-CM, and 105.3 F 5.5 for serum-free medium;
P < 0.005). Similarly, Panc1 cells formed a higher number of
colonies in soft agar with the addition of HPSC-CM in a dosedependent manner (144 F 6.6 for serum-free medium, 171 F 11.5
for 0.1 Ag/AL HPSC-CM, 209 F 12.7 for 0.25 Ag/AL HPSC-CM, 261 F
23.1 for 0.5 Ag/AL HPSC-CM, and 371 F 20.2 for 1.0 Ag/AL HPSCCM; P < 0.005, versus serum-free medium).
Conditioned medium from nonimmortalized HPSCs also stimulated tumor cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, from
0.25 to 1.0 Ag/AL for both BxPC3 and Panc1 tumor cell lines
(Fig. 2D). The stimulatory effects of HPSC-CM from nonimmortalized HPSCs on tumor cell migration, invasion, and soft-agar
colony formation were comparable to HPSC-CM from immortalized HPSCs and are not shown.
Pancreatic stellate cells inhibit effects of chemotherapy and
radiation on tumor cells. The addition of HPSC-CM to BxPC3
cells treated with gemcitabine (100 Amol/L) resulted in an
inhibition of apoptosis (38.9 F 3.1% apoptosis with serum-free
medium versus 9.4 F 1.1% apoptosis with HPSC-CM; P < 0.0001;
Fig. 3). There was no significant difference in total cell number in
the presence of gemcitabine with or without addition of HPSC-CM.
Similarly, after exposure to 100-Gy radiation, BxPC3 cells that
were treated with HPSC-CM (1 Ag/AL) showed less apoptosis
compared with cells grown in 10% DMEM (29.9% F 6.9 versus 66.8

Results
Primary culture and immortalization of HPSCs. Pancreatic
stellate cells were isolated from residual tissue from a fresh human
pancreatic adenocarcinoma surgical specimen and their identity
was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining for aSMA and
vimentin (data not shown). After lentiviral transfer of hTERT and
SV40-TAg and selection in G418, HPSCs continued to express aSMA
and vimentin (Fig. 1). The growth rate of HPSCs was highest for cells
immortalized with both hTERT and SV40-TAg compared with cells
transduced with SV40-TAg alone or nonimmortalized HPSCs
(doubling time, 12 versus 42 versus 113 h, respectively). HPSCs
immortalized with hTERT and SV40-Tag showed no evidence of
senescence at >100 passages. Morphology of HPSCs immortalized

blotting. Phosphorylated Erk1/2 was increased in cells treated with
HPSC-CM compared with control cells beginning at 5 min and
persisted until 120 min after treatment (Fig. 5). Similarly, addition
of HPSC-CM activated Akt 5 min after stimulation and continued
for 60 min. Compared with serum-free controls, stimulation with
HPSC-CM resulted in 43% increase in Erk1/2 activation at 15 min
and 125% increase in Akt activation at 5 min. Similar results were
observed in Panc1 cells (data not shown).

was comparable to the higher tumor cell number (1  106) for
every given tumor-to-stroma ratio. These results suggest that
HPSCs compensate for a lower tumor cell number and can
promote tumor initiation to result in tumor development
equivalent to the higher tumor cell number.
Interestingly, the proportion of mice that developed distant
metastases also increased with the number of HPSCs injected. With
a low tumor cell number (0.5  106 per mouse), none of the mice
developed metastases (Fig. 6B). When the same number of tumor
cells was mixed with HPSCs, the incidence of metastasis increased
in a dose-dependent manner with the proportion of stromal
fibroblasts (14.3% versus 40%; tumor-to-stroma ratio, 1:1 versus 1:5,
respectively). Metastases were predominantly intraperitoneal,
lymphatic, and hepatic; none were visible grossly or with IVIS
imaging in other organs. At a higher tumor cell number (1  106 per
mouse), the incidence of metastasis was higher than with a lower
starting number but was further increased in a concentrationdependent manner by the presence of stellate cells. As expected, no
metastatic lesions were identified in mice that received HPSCs only.
The presence of stromal fibroblasts affected not only tumor
incidence but also tumor size. As the proportion of HPSCs
increased relative to tumor cells, the total weight of the pancreas
including tumor increased (Fig. 6C). In the mice that received
tumor cells alone (0.5  106 per mouse), the weight of the pancreas
was 0.22 F 0.01 g and not significantly different than the pancreas
weight of mice that received HPSCs only. As the proportion of
HPSCs increased in the mixture, the weight of the pancreas
increased [0.46 F 0.18 versus 0.82 F 0.22 g; tumor-to-stroma ratio,
1:1 versus 1:5, respectively (means F SE)]. The mean pancreatic
weight in the group with tumor-to-stroma ratio 1:5 was significantly different from the group with tumor cells only (P < 0.05).
The increasing tumor burden was reflected in the IVIS signal

The histology of primary and metastatic tumors was confirmed

having a significant fibrotic component to the tumor (16), which is
not well recapitulated in orthotopic nude mouse models of pancreatic cancer that use injection of cultured human tumor cells.
Thus, to evaluate the contribution of stromal fibroblasts to the
growth of pancreatic cancer in vivo, we co-injected HPSCs with
BxPC3 tumor cells. To follow tumor progression in real time,
BxPC3 cells were labeled with firefly luciferase and bioluminescence was measured as previously described (15, 17). The
proportion of HPSCs in the co-injection relative to tumor cells
varied from 1:0 tumor-to-stroma ratio to 1:5, which reflects the
greater abundance of stroma typically observed in human
pancreatic adenocarcinomas.
The incidence of tumor formation increased when mice were
injected with both HPSCs and tumor cells. In the group injected
with equal numbers of tumor and stromal cells (0.5  106
cells/mouse), only 57% of mice formed tumors in the pancreas
(Fig. 6A). However, in the groups injected with 5-fold higher
number of stromal cells compared with tumor cells (tumorto-stroma ratio 1:5), pancreatic tumor formation was 100%.
No tumors developed when mice received HPSCs alone (0.5 or
1  106 per mouse).
None of the mice that received BxPC3 cells only at 0.5  106 per
mouse developed pancreatic tumors, but when the number of
BxPC3 cells was increased to 1  106, 43% of mice developed
tumors. Thus, the presence of HPSC stromal fibroblasts contributed to the initiation of tumor formation, particularly with a low
number of tumor cells. When HPSCs were present in equal or
greater numbers to tumor cells, the incidence of tumor formation
was increased compared with tumor cells alone, and the incidence

Discussion
The importance of the local tumor microenvironment to tumor
progression has been recognized for many years and highlighted in
several reviews (2, 3, 18). Insight into the role of tumor-associated
stroma in breast and prostate cancer has recently been described
(4, 19–27); however, in contrast, there is little known about the
possible contribution of the stroma to pancreatic cancer growth
and metastasis. This is particularly unfortunate as pancreatic
cancer has an especially abundant stroma. Using a new model of
human cancer-associated stellate cells, we found that conditioned
medium from HPSCs stimulated pancreatic tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth in a
dose-dependent manner. Moreover, conditioned medium from
HPSCs inhibited the response of tumor cells to chemotherapy and
radiation. These observations indicate that soluble factors are
produced by stellate cells that stimulate proliferation and survival
of pancreatic cancer cells. We also observed that co-injection of
stellate cells increased tumor incidence, growth, and metastasis in
an orthotopic model of pancreatic cancer. Taken together, these
studies indicate that the abundant stroma of pancreatic cancer
plays an important role in the aggressiveness of this disease.
Previously, a relevant cell model to study pancreatic cancer–
associated stromal fibroblasts did not exist. Although the
pancreatic stellate cell has been identified as the cell responsible

whelmingly abundant relative to neoplastic epithelial cells (16).
This is the first study to co-inject HPSCs with cancer cells in an
orthotopic model of pancreatic cancer; however, other investigators have also found that the presence of pancreatic stellate cells
increases growth of pancreatic cancer cells in s.c. xenograft models
(12, 30, 31).
The extensive stromal component of solid tumors has been
postulated by other groups to influence tumor response to chemotherapy (32, 33). In the current study, we have confirmed this
hypothesis. We observed HPSC-mediated inhibition of pancreatic
cancer cell responses to gemcitabine and radiation. Interestingly,
Ohuchida et al. (34) also found that radiation treatment of stromal
fibroblasts increases the invasiveness of pancreatic cancer cells even
more than nonirradiated fibroblasts. Thus, by including the stromal
contribution to pancreatic cancer, our xenograft model with coinjection of HPSCs and pancreatic tumor cells may be a more clinically relevant model of pancreatic adenocarcinoma than previous
xenograft models of tumor cells alone.
The mechanism responsible for the increased survival of pancreatic cancer cells treated with conditioned medium from stellate
cells is not certain. We observed that such treatments resulted in
the activation of both proliferation related (Erks) and survival

for stroma production in both chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic
cancer (5, 6, 28), few studies have used pancreatic stellate cells from
human pancreatic adenocarcinoma samples due to the relative
paucity of available fresh tumor specimens and the limited life span
of primary cells. Immortalization of rat (10) and human (29)
stellate cells has previously been found to be useful because
primary cells grow slowly and eventually senesce after 10 to 15
passages. Our study is the first report of the use of immortalized
primary HPSCs derived from pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Previous
studies in other solid tumors have suggested that phenotypic
differences exist between stromal cells derived from tumors and
normal tissues (23). Therefore, these tumor-derived cells are the
most relevant cell model to study the role of pancreatic cancer–
associated stromal fibroblasts.
We found that the effects of HPSCs on pancreatic cancer
were dose dependent. In vitro, this was manifest as a direct
concentration dependence of the effects of conditioned media.
In vivo, a tumor-to-stroma ratio of at least 1:1 or higher resulted
in the most dramatic increase in tumor growth and metastasis.
The higher proportion of stromal cells compared with tumor cells
is consistent with the histologic appearance of human pancreatic
adenocarcinoma, in which the desmoplastic stroma is over-

microenvironment, was recently shown to influence the number of
brain cancer stem cells (nestin+ and CD133+; ref. 39). Thus,
targeting the ‘‘niche’’ or unique microenvironment of the cancer
stem cells may be an effective therapeutic strategy. The mechanisms responsible for this effect are not completely understood,
but the observation suggests an important role for stellate cells in
tumor initiation.
The current study is limited to a single HPSC line isolated from a
single patient with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The effects of
stromal fibroblasts from different individuals may vary, as has been
shown in prostate cancer (40). Our lab has isolated HPSCs from
several other patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma but these
have not yet been immortalized. Another potential limitation of
this study is the two-dimensional nature of the in vitro experiments. It is increasingly recognized that two-dimensional models
of cancer can differ significantly from three-dimensional models
in cell morphology and behavior of tumor and stromal cells
(20, 41–43). It is likely that in three-dimensional cultures, HPSCs
may express genes that were not identified in our study, either
alone or in coculture with tumor cells. Finally, our study focuses on
cancer-associated fibroblasts as the sole stromal element interacting with tumor cells. However, many other cell types in the stroma
are known to influence tumor cells, of which the best studied are
the endothelial cells and pericytes that compose the vascular
compartment. Other cell types in the stroma, such as immune cells
(44) and adipocytes (45), also interact with tumor cells to mediate

related (Akt) pathways; these processes may be mediated by
interleukin-1h and transforming growth factor-h, both of which are
secreted by pancreatic stellate cells (35). Additional candidate
molecules that may mediate tumor-stromal interactions have been
identified by gene expression profiling of stromal fibroblast cocultured with CFPAC1 pancreatic cancer cells (36). Of the genes
identified, COX-2 was markedly augmented in both cancer cells
and fibroblasts when cultured together and was shown to mediate
invasion of CFPAC1 cells. In contrast, other stromal-derived factors
may suppress tumor growth. Sato et al. (37) found that SPARC was
overexpressed in stromal fibroblasts in pancreatic cancer and exogenous SPARC decreased proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells
in vitro. Thus, the interactions between tumor and stromal fibroblasts are quite complex and further studies will be necessary to
positively identify the factors and signaling mechanisms involved
in these interactions.
Another important observation in the current study was that the
presence of HPSCs increased the incidence of tumor formation
when limiting numbers of cancer cells were injected. Inclusion of
stellate cells allowed the injection of low numbers of cancer cells
that otherwise were unable to form tumors. This supports the
hypothesis that stellate cells provide a microenvironment that is
particularly advantageous to pancreatic cancer cells. It is possible
that stromal fibroblasts may interact with pancreatic cancer stem
cells, which have recently been described by Li et al. (38). The
tumor vasculature, another important component of the tumor

Figure 6. Co-injection of HPSCs with BxPC3 tumor cells in an orthotopic nude mouse
model of pancreatic cancer results in increased tumor incidence, metastasis, and tumor
size. HPSCs were injected with BxPC3 cells (either 0.5  106 or 1  106) in varying
tumor/stroma ratios. At 8 wk, mice were sacrificed and primary tumor incidence (A )
and metastasis (B ) were quantified. C , pancreatic tumors were weighed and the
luciferase signal from a representative mouse in each group is shown. D , H&E staining

in prevention of tumor development as well. The identity of these
stellate cell derived factors and their mechanisms of action are
the subject of ongoing investigations and may lead to novel
therapies directed toward the microenvironment of pancreatic

malignant behavior. Thus, a more physiologically relevant model
for human pancreatic adenocarcinoma would be one that includes
all stromal cell types along with tumor cells in a three-dimensional
environment, a model which is the subject of active investigation in
our laboratory.
In conclusion, our data provide evidence that stromal fibroblasts and tumor cells interact to promote tumor progression in
pancreatic cancer. The stroma also impairs tumor cell response
to chemotherapy and radiation. Moreover, in an orthotopic
model of pancreatic cancer, stromal fibroblasts enhanced tumor
growth, metastasis, and initiation. Our lab is currently investigating several stroma-specific factors associated with pancreatic
cancer and we hope to elucidate the specific mechanisms of
action of these molecules. With this information, targeting the
stroma in pancreatic cancer may not only be effective in treat-
