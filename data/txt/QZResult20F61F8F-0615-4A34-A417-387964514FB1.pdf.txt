ABSTRACT
Purpose: To evaluate the short-term efficacy and safety of recombinant human
endostatin (Endostar) combined with chemoradiotherapy for the treatment of
advanced, locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
Materials and Methods: Between March 2010 and October 2013, a total of 22
patients with stage rIII-IVb locally recurrent NPC underwent salvage radiotherapy
with Endostar in Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center. Intensity-modulated
radiotherapy (IMRT) was delivered. Platinum-based chemotherapy was used in
a neoadjuvant protocol. Endostar was continuously administered intravenously
(105 mg/m2) for 14 days (Days 1–14) from the first day of treatment during a 21-day
cycle. Tumor response and treatment toxicities were observed.
Results: Until January 2014, the median follow-up time was 13 months (range,
4–41 months). All patients completed the planned radiotherapy. A complete response
was achieved in 20 patients, and a partial response was achieved in 2 patients. The
incidence of grade 3–5 late radiation injury in this study was 50% (11/22) and that
of nasopharyngeal mucosal necrosis was 31.8% (7/22).
Conclusions: Endostar combined with chemoradiotherapy may be effective in
decreasing both the incidence of nasopharyngeal mucosal necrosis. Studies with a
larger sample size and longer follow-up are warranted.

stereotactic radiotherapy and brachytherapy, are effective
in highly selected patients with small recurrent lesions
within the nasopharynx, whereas chemotherapy alone
achieves only a palliative effect for patients with a bulky
tumor burden or for those with poor physical performance.
All of the above-mentioned treatments are usually limited
by the size, extent, and location of the tumor, as well
as by patient intention and consultation of radiation
oncologists and surgeons. In general, radiotherapy (RT)
and/or chemotherapy are suitable for the treatment of

INTRODUCTION
Recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has
a unique set of pathological and clinical characteristics.
The management of recurrent NPC remains a challenging
clinical problem. There is no standardized protocol or
guideline for the management of locally recurrent NPC.
The major salvage therapies of local recurrent NPC
include local treatment and systemic chemotherapy.
Aggressive local treatment methods, including surgery,

all recurrent T classification cases, but salvage surgery
is performed for early recurrent disease (T1-T2a) or for
certain highly selected recurrent T2b cases confined to
the superficial parapharyngeal space and for recurrent T3
disease confined to the base wall of the sphenoid sinus
[1, 2]. Therefore, external beam radiotherapy is still an
important modality and is sometimes the sole choice for
the salvage treatment of locally recurrent NPC patients.
Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has
gradually been accepted as the preferred choice for the
re-irradiation of locally recurrent NPC because of its
dosimetric superiority. However, even with IMRT, reirradiation is associated with a high incidence of late
complications and, consequently, toxicity-related death.
In recent years, the 5-year local control rate of the patients
with locally recurrent NPC who were treated with IMRT
was enhanced to 80.7%-85.8%, but the 5-year OS rate was
only 38%-44.9% [1, 3, 4].
After the initial course of treatment, the sensitivity
of locally recurrent tumor tissue to chemoradiotherapy
would decrease significantly due to tissue fibrosis and
vascular changes. To improve outcome, a minimal reirradiation dose combined with effective agents is another
choice. In recent years, targeted therapy has become a
promising anti-tumor treatment, ranked after the current
three primary anti-tumor methods: surgery, radiotherapy
and chemotherapy. When combined with surgery,
radiotherapy or chemotherapy, targeted therapy has shown
additive and synergistic effects [5–9].
Endostar is a new recombinant human endostatin
injection synthesized in China and is a multi-target
tumor cell inhibitor. Endostar can inhibit tumor growth
primarily through direct inhibition of vascular endothelial
cell proliferation via multiple targets such as vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), vascular endothelial
growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and platelet-derived
growth factor receptor (PDGFR). It can also exert an
antitumor effect via vascular normalization [10]. In the
clinical setting, Endostar has already shown encouraging
results for some tumors [11, 12].
On the basis of apparent benefits of Endostar in
other malignancies, we implemented the use of Endostar
with advanced locally recurrent NPC patients treated at
our department. We conducted this retrospective study to
report the outcome in these patients.

responses (PR) in 2 patients. Residual nasopharyngeal
tumor in one patient was noted to have continuously
shrunk in subsequent follow-up, and the patient underwent
observation. Residual cervical lymph nodes in the other
patient did not continuously shrink over time; therefore,
the patient underwent surgical excision and postoperative
radiotherapy 4 months after the completion of IMRT.
Treatment failures were as follows: regional lymph
node recurrence and multi-site metastasis including
the liver, lung and mediastinum in 1 patient; and liver
metastasis in 1 patient. A total 4 patients died. Two deaths
were attributed to tumor metastasis, 1 to nasopharyngeal
hemorrhage and 1 to radiation temporal lobe necrosis. The
1-year and 2-year OS, local-regional failure free survival
(LRFFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and
progression-free survival (PFS) rates were as follows:
OS, 93.3% and 66.4%, respectively; LRFFS, 89.3%
and 78.1%, respectively; DMFS, 90.0% and 78.8%,
respectively; and PFS, 92.3% and 52.7%, respectively.

Toxicity
No grade 5 toxicity (death) occurred during treatment.
Acute ≥ grade 3 toxicities included cardiotoxicity (1 patient),
mucositis (3 patients) and myelosuppression (3 patients). Late
≥ grade 3 toxicities were documented as follows: radiation
encephalopathy in 4 patients; and nasopharyngeal mucosal
necrosis in 7 patients (among these 1 patient experienced
nasopharyngeal hemorrhage). The clinical characteristics of
the patients with or without necrosis of the nasopharyngeal
mucosa are listed in Table 2. The median fractionation dose
of patients with nasopharyngeal mucosal necrosis was
significantly higher than that of patients without necrosis
(2.20 Gy versus 2.00 Gy, p = 0.01).

DISCUSSION
Salvage treatment of locally recurrent NPC is a very
difficult issue. Patients with early stage disease may be
curable. In contrast, the treatment options for advanced
locally recurrent NPC patients (rT3-T4) are very limited,
and re-irradiation is the only choice in most circumstances.
Poon et al [13] adopted concomitant chemoradiotherapy
with adjuvant chemotherapy to treat 35 locally recurrent
NPC patients, 66% of whom were staged as rT3-T4,
and the 2-year OS and PFS rates were only 45% and
23%, respectively. Chua et al [14]. reported that 1-year
locoreginal progression-free, distant metastasis-free
and OS rates of 56% , 90% and 63% respectively, after
a median follow-up time of 11 months; the 1-year local
progression-free rate of rT4 in NPC patients was only
35% versus 100% for rT1–3 patients. In 2004, we began
to treat locally recurrent NPC patients using IMRT, and
we previously reported that the 2-year OS rate of rT1–2
patients was 85%, whereas that of rT3–4 patients was
only 56% [1, 3, 15]. Taken together, the treatment of

advanced locally recurrent NPC is a significant challenge
for oncologists.
In recent years, targeted therapy has become
another promising treatment method for malignancies.
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and VEGFR
are strongly expressed in head and neck squamous cell
carcinomas (HNSCC), including NPC. Several studies
of HNSCC have demonstrated that a variety of targeted
drugs perform anti-tumor activity and yield encouraging
clinical outcomes by blocking these specific receptors.
Chan et al [16] conducted a phase II study to evaluate the
activity and safety of cetuximab plus carboplatin in 60
patients with advanced locally recurrent or metastatic NPC
who experienced treatment failure after platinum-based
chemotherapy. The results showed an overall response
rate (RR) and disease control rate (DCR) of 11.7% and
60.0%, respectively. Cohen et al [17] performed a phase I/
II study to treat 48 recurrent or metastatic HNSCC patients
using Erlotinib and Bevacizumab. The objective RR and
DCR were 15% and 46%, respectively. Argiris et al [18]
reported the treatment outcomes of a phase II study to
evaluate the efficacy of pemetrexed and Bevacizumab in
40 recurrent or metastatic HNSCC patients. The objective
RR and DCR were 30% and 86%, respectively.
Endostatin is a broad-spectrum angiogenesis
inhibitor and tumor suppressor. Ye et al [19] performed
a randomized, open-label, phase II, multicenter clinical
trial in patients with advanced HNSCC and recurrent
or metastatic NPC using paclitaxel and cisplatin with
or without adenovirus-encapsulated endostatin (E10A)
administered by intratumoral injection. E10A plus
chemotherapy were well tolerated. The authors detected
an objective RR that rose to 39.7% in the E10A group,
comparing favorably with that reported in trials using
Bevacizumab [17, 18]. The authors also assessed
molecular biomarkers related to angiogenesis in patient
serum before and after the first administration of E10A.
The serum VEGF levels in E10A treated patients were
significantly lower in the CR+PR groups than in the SD
(stable disease) +PD (progressive disease) groups, which
supports the hypothesis that endostatin suppresses VEGFstimulated endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and
tumor angiogenesis.
Endostar (recombinant human endostatin injection),
a type of human angiogenesis inhibitor, exerts anti-tumor
effects by inhibiting the function of endothelial cells and
reducing tumor angiogenesis [10]. To our knowledge, no
data have been previously reported regarding the efficacy
and safety of Endostar for the treatment of recurrent NPC.
Our retrospective analysis showed that Endostar plus
IMRT yielded quite promising tumor control and survival
results for advanced locally recurrent NPC patients. The
RR, CR, 1- and 2-year OS rates reached 100.0%, 90.9%,
93.3% and 66.4%, respectively, which were significantly
superior to results reported in the literature [1, 3, 13, 20].

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

These findings exceeded our expectations and suggested
the potential efficacy of Endostar in the treatment of
advanced locally recurrent NPC patients.
In recent years, the 5-year local control rate of the
patients with locally recurrent NPC treated with IMRT
was enhanced to 80.7%-85.8%, but the 5-year OS rate
was only 38%-44.9% [1, 3, 4]. Late radiation injury is
the major reason for treatment failure and has become
the most important concern in the re-irradiation of locally
recurrent NPC patients. Han et al [1] reported that the
incidence of grade 3–5 radiation injury was 70.7% after
the second course of radiotherapy in recurrent NPC (rT3–
4, 75.3%), of which 40.6% suffered from nasopharyngeal
mucosal infection and/or necrosis (more than 70% in rT3
and rT4 patients). Among these patients, severe cases
would develop deadly nasopharyngeal hemorrhage. In
addition, Qiu et al [20] reported that 70 patients with
radiologic or pathologically proven locally recurrent NPC
were treated with IMRT. Only fifty-seven percent were
staged as rT3–4. Sixty-five patients received the planned
radiation therapy (median dose, 70 Gy), and 5 patients had
their treatment terminated between 50 and 60 Gy because
of acute mucositis. Late grade 3–4 toxicities were noted in
25 patients (35.7%). Eleven patients (15.7%) had posterior
nasal space ulceration, 17 (24.3%) experienced cranial
nerve palsies, 12 (17.1%) had trismus, and 12 (17.1%)
experienced deafness.
The incidence of late grade 3–5 radiation injury
in this study was 50% (11/22), and the incidence of
nasopharyngeal mucosal infection and/or necrosis was
31.8% (7/22), which is substantially lower than that
noted in historic data regarding advanced recurrent NPC.
Endoscopic examination results of the patients previously
treated with IMRT alone in our center and treated with
Endostar + IMRT in this study are shown in Figure 1.
Endothelial cell apoptosis induced by radiotherapy
can damage the integrity of the vascular barrier, resulting
in tissue edema and hypoxia. Meanwhile, hypoxia also
leads to VEGF upregulation; consequently, this situation
contributes to increased vascular permeability and
tissue necrosis [21–23]. Endostar can participate in all
tumor angiogenic processes. Endostar combined with
chemoradiotherapy may be effective in decreasing both
the incidence and degree of nasopharyngeal mucosal
necrosis. First, Endostar could normalize abnormal
vessels surrounding the tumor in the irradiation field
and improve the blood supply to necrotic tissue. Second,
Endostar could decrease the immature vascular number to
reduce oxygen consumption, enhance hypoxic tolerance,
reduce inflammatory exudation and strengthen the
recovery capability of necrotic tissue by downregulation
of VEGF activity [10, 11]. Zheng et al [25] determined
that Endostar could increase radiotherapy sensitivity and
attenuate radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) by vascular
normalization and downregulation of the expression of

the inflammatory mediator-transforming growth factor
β1 (TGFβ1). Chen et al [26] found that Endostar could
decrease liver inflammation and hepatocyte necrosis in the
CCl4-induced liver fibrosis model. Their data indicate that
Endostar might play a role in counteracting liver fibrosis
and hepatocyte necrosis through the TGFβ and VEGF
transduction pathways.
The time course of “vascular normalization” is
also a crucial factor that should be taken into account
when Endostar and chemoradiotherapy are combined.
Peng et al [11] demonstrated that the Endostar vascular
normalization time window was within approximately
3 days after Endostar administration in the CNE-2 and
5–8F NPC xenograft models. In addition, the combination
of radiation with Endostar showed enhanced antitumor effects during the normalization time induced
by delivering Endostar. The authors also investigated
the underlying mechanisms that suggested that during
the normalization window, Endostar might increase the
pericyte coverage of NPC tumor vessels via upregulation
of a powerful endogenous anti-angiogenic and antitumor
factor-Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) and
downregulation of VEGF, thus inhibiting VEGF signaling
that can be attributed to the local increase in oxygenation
and decrease in tissue necrosis and edema.
In addition, the median fractionation dose of the
patients developing nasopharyngeal mucosal necrosis
(2.20 Gy) was significantly higher than the dose of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

those without necrosis (2.00 Gy), implying that a high
fractionation dose may be one of the important and notable
causes of nasopharyngeal mucosal necrosis.
For advanced locally recurrent NPC, Endostar
combined with chemoradiotherapy yielded better shortterm efficacy and good tolerance. Endostar may alleviate
nasopharyngeal mucosal necrosis after the second course
of radiotherapy.
A prospective study is warranted to confirm the
results we obtained from our retrospective analysis and
we have already begin to work on it.

Follow up

Among all the locally recurrent NPC patients who
received treatment from March 2010 to October 2013
in our Center, a total of 22 patients matched the criteria.
There were 5 females and 17 males, with a median age
of 45 years (range, 28–61 years). Magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) of nasopharynx and neck was performed
for the staging evaluations. Positron emission tomography
computed tomography (PET-CT) was performed at the
physician’s discretion. Restaging demonstrated rIII, rIVa,
and rIVb in 11, 8, and 3 patients, respectively.

The first follow-up visit was evaluated after IMRT
completion. Afterwards, the patients were followed up at
1 and 3 months post-completion, and then every 3 months
for the first 3 years and every 6 months thereafter.
OS was defined as the time from the first day
of treatment to the date of death or the final follow-up.
LRFFS was defined as the time from the first day of
treatment until the date of local or regional failure. DMFS
was defined as the time from the first day of treatment
until the date of distant metastasis. PFS was defined as the
time from the first day of treatment until the date of local/
regional recurrence or distant metastasis or death.

Treatment
All patients underwent IMRT. An MRI with or
without PET-CT showed that gross tumor volume (GTV)
was contoured. The clinical target volume (CTV) was
delineated, including the GTV plus a 1–1.5-cm margin.
The CTV also included the entire nasopharynx and the
positive lymph node regions. When the GTV was adjacent
to critical organs at risk (OARs), for example, the spinal
cord, temporal lobe or brainstem, the margin of the CTV
was adjusted to no more than 3 mm, depending on the
proximity of critical structures. A detailed description of
OARs contouring and the delivery procedure of IMRT
are provided in our previous reports [1]. The median
prescribed dose of IMRT was 64 Gy (60–68 Gy)/32
fractions (28–33 fractions), and the median fractionated
prescribed dose was 2.10 Gy (1.88–2.29 Gy).
Among the 22 patients, 18 received cisplatin-based
neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Details of the chemotherapy
regimens are shown in Table 1.
Endostar
was
continuously
administered
intravenously at a dose of 105 mg/m2 for 14 days (Days
1–14) from the first day of treatment during a 21-day
cycle. The detailed schedules of Endostar are shown in
Table 1.

Statistical analyses
SPSS 21.0 statistical package was used to analyze
the data. The OS, LRFFS, DMFS and PFS rates were
analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Log-rank tests
were used to detect differences between the groups. The
differences between continuous variables were compared
with t test. The differences between categorical variables
were compared with the Chi-squared test. All statistical tests
were two-sided, and p < 0.05 was considered significant.

authors read and approved the final manuscript.

Short-term efficacy was assessed 3 months after
the completion of IMRT. The residual tumor was
evaluated according to clinical examinations (including
nasopharyngeal endoscopy) and MRI. Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST
v1.1) was used to assess the treatment response of
recurrent soft tumor lesions within the nasopharyngeal
cavity.
Acute toxicities were evaluated according to the
Common Toxicity Criteria 3.0 of the American National
Cancer Institute; late toxicities were graded according to
the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Late Radiation
Morbidity Scoring Scheme. Evaluation of acute toxicity
(occurring between the start of treatment and 90 days
after the end of radiotherapy) was performed once a week
and late toxicity (occurring > 90 days after the end of
radiotherapy) was conducted at least once every 3 months.
