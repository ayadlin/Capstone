Abstract
Osteoclasts mediate bone destruction in breast cancer skeletal
metastases. Cathepsin K is a proteinase that is secreted by
osteoclasts and degrades bone. Here, immunohistochemistry
revealed that cathepsin K was expressed not only by
osteoclasts but also by breast cancer cells that metastasize
to bone. Following intratibial injection with cathepsin K–
expressing human BT474 breast cancer cells, tumor-bearing
mice treated with a clinical dosing regimen of cathepsin K
inhibitor (CKI; 50 mg/kg, twice daily) had osteolytic lesions
that were 79% smaller than those of tumor-bearing mice
treated with the vehicle. The effect of CKI was also studied in a
mouse model in which the i.v. inoculation of human B02
breast cancer cells expressing cathepsin K leads to bone
metastasis formation. Drug administration was started before
(preventive protocol) or after (treatment protocol) the
occurrence of osteolytic lesions. In treatment protocols, CKI
(50 mg/kg, twice daily) or a single clinical dose of 100 Mg/kg
zoledronic acid (osteoclast inhibitor) reduced the progression
of osteolytic lesions by 59% to 66%. CKI therapy also reduced
skeletal tumor burden by 62% compared with vehicle, whereas
zoledronic acid did not decrease the tumor burden. The
efficacy of CKI at inhibiting skeletal tumor burden was similar
in the treatment and preventive protocols. By contrast, CKI
did not block the growth of s.c. B02 tumor xenografts in
animals. Thus, CKI may render the bone a less favorable
microenvironment for tumor growth by inhibiting bone
resorption. These findings raise the possibility that cathepsin
K could be a therapeutic target for the treatment of bone
metastases. [Cancer Res 2007;67(20):9894–902]

Introduction
Bone metastases are common complications of breast cancer
(1, 2). They can be fatal or may rapidly impede the quality of life (1, 2).
Bone-residing breast cancer cells do not directly destroy bone (2).
Instead, they secrete molecules like parathyroid hormone–related
protein, interleukins (IL-6, IL-8, and IL-11), and prostaglandins that
stimulate osteoclast activity, leading to osteolysis (2–6).
Osteoclasts are large multinucleated cells formed by fusion of
mononuclear monocyte-macrophage progenitors whose differen-

tiation is principally regulated by receptor activator of nuclear
factor-nB ligand and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (7).
Osteoclasts are the bone resorptive cells. They resorb bone by
secreting protons and a lysosomal cysteine proteinase, cathepsin K
(7). Protons dissolve bone mineral and provide an acidic microenvironment enabling cathepsin K to degrade the demineralized
collagenous matrix (7). The most compelling evidence that cathepsin K is involved in osteoclast-mediated bone resorption comes
from the demonstration that cathepsin K–knockout mice display
an osteopetrotic phenotype associated with a severe impairment of
the resorptive activity of osteoclasts (8).
The observation that osteoclasts play a pivotal role in the
formation of osteolytic lesions has provided the rationale for using
bisphosphonates as potent inhibitors of osteoclast-mediated bone
resorption in the treatment of breast cancer patients with bone
metastases (1). Bisphosphonates bind avidly to bone mineral, and
those containing a nitrogen moiety in their structure target
osteoclast farnesyl diphosphate synthase, a key enzyme in the
mevalonate pathway (9, 10). The inhibition of farnesyl diphosphate
synthase by nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates prevents the
prenylation of small GTPases that are essential for osteoclast
activity and survival, thereby causing a reduction of bone
resorption (1). Yet, in the clinic, bisphosphonate treatment is only
palliative and does not provide a life-prolonging benefit to the
majority of patients with advanced cancer (1). New therapeutics
targeting osteoclast activity are therefore required. They could be
used in combination with bisphosphonates to more efficiently treat
breast cancer patients with bone metastases.
This need could be fulfilled by cathepsin K inhibitors (CKI). They
have successfully been used in the treatment of bone loss
associated with osteoporosis (11). In addition, cathepsin K is
expressed by human breast cancer cells in skeletal metastases (12),
suggesting that CKIs could target not only osteoclasts but also
tumor cells. Here, we present experimental evidence that a CKI,
alone or in combination with nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate
zoledronic acid, reduces breast cancer–induced osteolysis and
skeletal tumor burden in animals.

Materials and Methods
Drugs and reagents. CKIs and zoledronic acid [1-hydroxy-2-(1Himidazole-1-yl)ethylidene-bisphosphonic acid, used as a disodium salt]
were obtained from Novartis Pharma AG. The structure of CKI has
previously been reported (11, 13). CKI was dissolved in 65% (v/v)
cremophor EL and 35% (v/v) absolute ethanol, and this solution was used
as the vehicle for in vitro and in vivo experiments. Zoledronic acid was
dissolved in PBS.
Breast cancer cell lines. Human BT474 breast carcinoma cells were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Human B02 breast
carcinoma cells are a subpopulation of the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell

line specifically selected for its high efficiency to metastasize to bone after
i.v. inoculation (14). A mouse mammary carcinoma cell line (CCL-51) stably
transfected to express cathepsin K has been provided by Novartis and was
used here as a positive control for Western immunoblotting experiments.
Characteristics of the BT474, B02, and CCL-51 breast cancer cell lines have
been described elsewhere (13–15). BT474, MDA-MB-231, B02, and CCL-51
cells are routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with
10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) and 1% (v/v) penicillin/
streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37jC in a 5% CO2 incubator.
Reverse transcription and PCR. Total RNA from BT474, B02, and
MDA-MB-231 cells was extracted using Total RNA Isolation System
(Promega). cDNA was synthesized using Moloney murine virus-1 reverse
transcriptase (Promega). A 399-bp fragment of cathepsin K was amplified
using 5¶-CAGCAAAGGTGTGTATTATGATGAAAGC as the forward primer
and 5¶-ATGGGTGGAGAGAAGCAAAGTAGGAAGG as the reverse primer.
PCR reactions were run using a program consisting of 1 cycle at 94jC
for 5 min, and then 40 cycles of 94jC for 30 s, 54jC for 15 s, and 72jC
for 30 s.
Breast cancer tissue specimens. The autopsy files of the Department
of Pathology (Pr. J. Boniver, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire of Liège,
Belgium) were searched for diagnosis of disseminated breast cancer with
histologically proven bone metastases during the period of 1991 to 1998.
Slides were retrieved and clinical history was obtained. Two breast cancer
patients deceased of disseminated disease, including bone metastases,
were selected for this study (case A: primary breast carcinoma with bone,
liver, and lung metastatic lesions; case B: primary breast carcinoma with
bone, liver, and renal metastatic lesions). Twelve additional specimens of
bone metastasis were also randomly selected for the present study. Soft
tissue metastases were fixed in formalin, dehydrated, and paraffin
embedded. Formalin-fixed bone specimens were decalcified with a
solution of EDTA and hydrochloric acid (Decalcifier II, Surgipath Europe
Ltd.) or with a solution of formalin (20%) containing 5% (v/v) nitric acid.
Paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were sectioned at 5 Am. Slides were then
processed for immunostaining.
Antibodies and immunodetection of cathepsin K. The presence of
cathepsin K in human breast cancer tissue specimens, experimental bone
metastases, and s.c. tumor xenografts was immunodetected with a rabbit
polyclonal antibody (Biovision) followed by immunoperoxidase staining
(ABC Vectastain Elite kit, Vector Laboratories, Inc.) according to the
supplier’s instructions. Tissue sections were first deparaffinized in xylene
and rehydrated in graded ethanols. Blocking of the endogenous peroxidase
activity was carried out by immersing the slides in 1.2% hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2) in methanol for 30 min. For antigen retrieval, the slides were heated
at 95jC during 40 min in 0.01 mol/L citrate buffer (pH 6.0), then incubated
with normal goat serum (1:20) to block the nonspecific serum-binding sites.
The anti–cathepsin K antibody (1:1,000 in PBS) was added and incubated
overnight at 4jC in a humidified chamber. After washing in PBS, slides were
incubated for 30 min with a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:200),
washed again with PBS, then incubated with the avidin-biotin-peroxidase
complex. Peroxidase activity was developed by addition of a solution of
3,3¶-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Vel) and 0.03% H2O2 in PBS.
Slides were then counterstained with Carazzi’s hematoxylin and washed in
distilled water. After dehydration in graded alcohols, the slides were
coverslipped. Negative control experiments included omission of the first
antibody and preincubation of slides with a 100 molar excess of cathepsin K
before antibody use.
The immunodetection of cathepsin K in BT474, B02, MDA-MB-231, and
CCL-51 whole protein extracts was done by Western blotting with an anti–
cathepsin K mouse monoclonal antibody (Novocastra) diluted 1:500 in TBS
containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. The remainder of the experimental
procedure was as previously described (14).
Scoring of cathepsin K immunostaining in human breast cancer
tissue specimens. The immunostaining intensity was evaluated independently by two investigators (A.B. and V.C.). The intensity of the staining was
scored arbitrarily as follows: negative (), weak (1+), moderate (2+), and
strong (3+). In case of disagreement between examiners, slides were
reviewed and a consensus opinion was obtained.

In vitro tumor cell invasion assay. This assay was done essentially as
previously described (6, 14, 15). Tumor cell invasion experiments were
conducted using Bio-Coat cell chambers (Becton Dickinson) consisting of
24-well companion plates with cell culture inserts containing 8-Am pore
size filters coated with Matrigel (37 Ag/filter). Untreated or CKI-treated B02
cells (0.25  105/500 AL) were seeded in culture inserts (upper chamber)
and the chemoattractant (10% FBS) was placed in each well of a companion
plate (lower chamber). After a 24-h incubation at 37jC in a 5% CO2
incubator, noninvading cells were removed and the invading cells on the
under surface of the filter were fixed and stained. Membranes were
mounted on glass slides and the cells from 10 random microscopic fields
(400 magnification) were counted. All experiments were run in duplicate,
and invasion was expressed as the number of invading cells per square
millimeter.
Animals. All procedures involving animals including housing and care,
method of euthanasia, and experimental protocols were conducted in
accordance with a code of practice established by the local ethical
committee (CREEA, Lyon, France). Studies were routinely inspected by the
attending veterinarian to ensure continued compliance with the proposed
protocols. Four- or 10-week-old female BALB/c homozygous (nu/nu)
athymic mice were obtained from Charles River.
Animal model of intraosseous tumorigenesis. For intraosseous tumor
xenograft experiments in anesthesized 10-week-old nude mice, a small hole
was drilled with a 30-gauge sterile needle through the left tibial plateau with
the knee flexed. Using a new sterile needle fitted to a 50-AL sterile Hamilton
syringe (Hamilton Co.), a single-cell suspension (5  105 in 30-AL PBS) of
BT474 cells was carefully injected in the bone marrow cavity. Fourteen days
after tumor cell inoculation, CKI (50 mg/kg, twice daily) or the vehicle was
given to animals by i.p. injection during 28 days. On day 42 after tumor cell
inoculation, radiographs of anesthetized mice were taken with the use of
MIN-R2000 films (Kodak) in an MX-20 cabinet X-ray system (Faxitron X-ray
Corp.). The osteolytic lesion area on radiographs was measured using a
Visiolab 2000 computerized image analysis system (Explora Nova) and the
extent of bone destruction per animal was expressed in square millimeters,
as previously described (6, 14, 15). Anesthetized mice were killed by cervical
dislocation after radiography on day 42.
Animal model of bone metastasis. The bone metastasis experiments in
mice were conducted as previously described (6, 14–16). B02 cells (5  105
in 100-AL PBS) were inoculated into the tail vein of anesthetized nude mice.
In this model, animals usually develop bone metastases 18 days after tumor
cell inoculation, as judged by radiography (6, 14–16). Radiographs of
animals were taken 18, 25, and 32 days after tumor cell inoculation, as
described above. At sacrifice (day 32), metastatic hind limbs were collected
for peripheral quantitative computed tomography (CT), histology, and
histomorphometric analysis.
For treatment protocols, mice were first analyzed by radiography on
day 18, and tumor-bearing mice were distributed among the different
treatment groups to balance these groups for the extent of bone
destruction at baseline. Metastatic animals were then treated with CKI,
alone or in combination with zoledronic acid. For the preventive
protocols, CKI treatment of animals began on the day of tumor cell
inoculation (day 0). CKI (50 mg/kg) or the vehicle was given twice daily by
i.p. injection from day 18 to day 32 (treatment protocols) or from day 0 to
day 32 (preventive protocols). A single dose (100 Ag/kg) of zoledronic acid
was given to mice by s.c. injection on day 18 (treatment protocol only).
This bisphosphonate dose is equivalent to the clinical dose of 4 mg every
3 to 4 weeks, after adjustment for the different molecular weights of the
commercial clinical formulation (290.1, free acid monohydrate) and the
research-grade compound (401.6, disodium salt, 4.75 hydrate) used in this
study.
Animal model of s.c. tumorigenesis. B02 breast cancer cells (106) were
inoculated s.c. (200 AL) into the right flank of nude mice, as previously
described (6). Twenty-one days after tumor cell inoculation, when tumor
xenografts became palpable, mice were randomized into two groups: one
group received CKI (50 mg/kg, twice daily), administered i.p., whereas the
other group received the vehicle only. Tumor size was assessed by external
measurement of the length (L) and width (W) of tumor xenografts. Tumor

Cathepsin K and Breast Cancer Bone Metastasis

Results
Cathepsin K expression in human breast cancer bone
metastases and breast cancer cell lines. As a first step toward
studying the role of cathepsin K in breast cancer bone metastases,
we did immunohistochemistry for cathepsin K expression in
primary breast tumors, metastatic lesions, and breast cancer cell
lines. Primary breast tumors and their matching metastatic lesions
from two patients were initially studied (see cases A and B in
Materials and Methods). As illustrated in Fig. 1A (case A), cathepsin
K was strongly expressed in breast cancer cells of a bone metastasis (image 2) as opposed to that observed in the primary tumor
(image 1) and matching lung and liver metastases (images 3 and 4,
respectively). Similar results were obtained with case B (data not
shown). This observation led us to extend our study and investigate
the expression of cathepsin K in bone metastatic specimens from
12 patients with advanced breast cancer. The scoring of the
cathepsin K staining intensity in these bone metastatic specimens
showed a moderate to strong staining in tumor cells from 11 out of
12 bone metastases, whereas a weak staining of tumor cells was
observed in 1 bone metastatic specimen. For all of the bone
metastatic specimens studied, the intensity of the cathepsin K
staining in osteoclasts was stronger than that observed in tumor
cells. Moreover, human breast cancer cell lines (BT474, B02, and
MDA-MB-231) also expressed cathepsin K, as judged by both PCR
and Western immunoblotting (Fig. 1B). Because of the expression
of cathepsin K in breast cancer cells and osteoclasts, we next
examined whether a CKI could inhibit breast cancer–induced bone
destruction in animals.
Effect of a CKI on bone destruction in an animal model of
intraosseous tumorigenesis. We used an experimental model in
which immunocompromised mice display radiographic evidence of
osteolytic lesions 14 days after intratibial inoculation of human
BT474 breast cancer cells (13). Tumor-bearing mice were treated
with CKI (50 mg/kg, twice daily) or the vehicle from day 14 to day
42 after tumor cell inoculation. This dosing regimen of CKI was
calculated on the basis of the daily 50-mg clinical dose of CKI that
is given in phase II trials for the treatment of osteoporosis (11).
Radiographic analysis on day 42 revealed that tumor-bearing
animals treated with CKI had osteolytic lesions (mean F SD,
0.43 F 0.4 mm2/mouse; n = 8 mice) that were 79% smaller [95%
confidence interval (95% CI), 62–95%; P = 0.016] than those of
tumor-bearing mice treated with the vehicle (mean F SD, 2 F 1.4
mm2/mouse; n = 8 mice; Fig. 2). The inhibitory effect of CKI on
cancer-induced bone destruction was confirmed by three-dimensional micro-CT reconstruction of metastatic tibiae (Fig. 2).
To further assess the therapeutic efficacy of CKI on bone
destruction, experiments were next conducted in a mouse model of
bone metastasis caused by human B02 breast cancer cells, in which
CKI treatment started before (preventive protocol) or after
(treatment protocol) immunocompromised animals develop osteolytic lesions.
Effect of a CKI on the progression of established breast
cancer bone metastases (treatment protocol). We used a mouse
model of breast cancer bone metastasis in which animals display
radiographic evidence of osteolytic lesions in hind limbs 18 days
after i.v. inoculation of B02 tumor cells (6, 14–16). The effect of CKI
(50 mg/kg, i.p., twice daily) was studied on the progression of
established osteolytic lesions by using a treatment protocol in
which drug administration to tumor-bearing mice was initiated on
day 18 after tumor cell injection. We then compared the effect of

www.aacrjournals.org

this CKI dosing regimen with that of a single dose of bisphosphonate zoledronic acid (100 Ag/kg of body weight) administered
s.c. to animals on day 18 after tumor cell injection. The effect
of CKI in combination with zoledronic acid was also examined.
The dosage of 100 Ag/kg zoledronic acid was calculated to be
equivalent to the 4-mg clinical i.v. dose given to breast cancer
patients with bone metastases (see Materials and Methods for
further details on the dose).
Radiographic analysis on day 32 after tumor cell injection
revealed that tumor-bearing animals treated with CKI had
osteolytic lesions that were 66% (95% CI, 53–79%; P < 0.001)
smaller than those of tumor-bearing mice treated with the vehicle
(Table 1; Fig. 3A). Similarly, tumor-bearing animals that were
treated with zoledronic acid had osteolytic lesions that were 59%
(95% CI, 48–69%; P < 0.001) smaller than those of vehicle-treated
animals (Table 1; Fig. 3A). The inhibitory effect of zoledronic acid
on progression of osteolytic lesions did not differ statistically
significantly from that observed with CKI. In addition, the use of
CKI in combination with zoledronic acid did not further reduce
the progression of osteolytic lesions in metastatic animals (Table 1;
Fig. 3A). These results were confirmed by three-dimensional microCT reconstruction of metastatic hind limbs (Fig. 3A).

bP < 0.001, compared with the vehicle-treated group by ANOVA followed by a Fisher’s PLSD test.

Histomorphometric analysis of hind limbs with metastases
showed that mice treated with CKI, zoledronic acid, or the
combination of CKI with zoledronic acid had statistically
significantly higher BV/TV ratios (indicating a prevention of bone
loss) than vehicle-treated animals (Table 1). For instance, treatments with CKI, zoledronic acid, and CKI + zoledronic acid
increased the BV/TV by 59% (95% CI, 44–96%), 125% (95% CI,
91–163%), and 102% (95% CI, 69–135%), respectively, compared
with vehicle (P < 0.001 for all three regimens). Zoledronic acid
(alone or in combination with CKI) was statistically significantly
more effective (P = 0.001 and P = 0.05, respectively) than CKI alone
in increasing the BV/TV ratio (Table 1). This higher BV/TV ratio
was due mainly to the increased trabecular bone area that can be
viewed on Goldner’s trichrome–stained tissue sections of bones
from animals treated with zoledronic acid, alone or in combination
with CKI (Fig. 3A).
CKI, alone or in combination with zoledronic acid, statistically
significantly decreased the TB/STV ratio (a measure of the skeletal
tumor burden) by 60% (95% CI, 40–84%; P < 0.001) and 74% (95%
CI, 44–98%; P < 0.001), respectively, compared with vehicle (Table 1;
Fig. 3A). The TB/STV ratio for CKI alone did not differ statistically
significantly from that obtained with CKI in combination with
zoledronic acid (Table 1; Fig. 3A). By contrast, a single dose of
zoledronic acid decreased the TB/STV ratio by only 0.5% (95% CI,
0.7–11%; Table 1; Fig. 3A).

CKI-treated animals did not have a loss of the body weight at the
end of the treatment protocol when compared with vehicle-treated
animals [19 F 1.5 g (n = 9) and 18.9 F 1.4 g (n = 8), respectively].
Effect of a CKI on the formation of experimental breast
cancer bone metastases (preventive protocol). We next studied
the effect of this dosing regimen of CKI (50 mg/kg, twice daily) on
the formation of bone metastases by using a preventive protocol in
which drug administration was initiated at the time of B02 breast
cancer cell inoculation. Zoledronic acid is only approved for the
treatment of patients with advanced cancer (1) and is not yet
registered for use in the preventive setting.
Radiographic monitoring of the formation of osteolytic lesions in
animals 18, 25, and 32 days after tumor cell inoculation indicated
that CKI substantially reduced bone metastasis formation as early
as day 25 (Fig. 3B). In the treatment protocol, CKI did not reduce
the formation of osteolytic lesions on day 25 (data not shown). Yet,
on day 32, the extent of inhibition of bone destruction in the
treatment protocol [66% inhibition (95% CI, 53–79%)] was similar
to that observed in the preventive protocol [61% inhibition (95% CI,
39–84%); Tables 1 and 2].
Histomorphometric analysis of metastatic hind limbs revealed
that mice treated with CKI had a BV/TV ratio increased by 155%
(95% CI, 81–237%; P < 0.001) compared with vehicle (Table 2). A
preventive dosing regimen of CKI was more effective than a
treatment dosing regimen in increasing the BV/TV ratio (Tables 1

and 2). These results may be explained by the total cumulative
dose of CKI administered to animals in the preventive setting
(3,200 mg), which was 2.3-fold higher than in the treatment
setting (1,400 mg).
Compared with the vehicle, a preventive CKI dosing regimen
also reduced the skeletal tumor burden by 54% (95% CI, 16–93%;
P = 0.007; Table 2). However, the efficacy of CKI at inhibiting
skeletal tumor burden in this preventive setting did not differ
significantly from that observed in the treatment setting [62%
inhibition (95% CI, 40–84%); Table 1]. We would have expected the
preventive dosing regimen to have inhibited skeletal tumor burden
more than what we observed because the cathepsin K immunostaining of bones bearing metastatic lesions revealed that B02 breast
cancer cells strongly expressed cathepsin K in situ (Fig. 3C). We
therefore examined whether the dosing regimen of CKI used in our
bone metastasis model could directly affect the growth of s.c. B02
tumor xenografts in animals.

Effect of a CKI on the growth of s.c. breast cancer xenografts
in vivo. We used a mouse model of tumorigenesis in which human
B02 breast cancer cells were injected s.c. to immunocompromised mice. At the time the volume of tumor xenografts reached
f200 mm3 (21 days after tumor cell injection), animals were treated with CKI (50 mg/kg, i.p., twice daily) or the vehicle for 32 days
(day 52). At the end of the protocol (day 52), the total cumulative
dose of CKI given to each mouse was 3,200 mg.
Compared with the vehicle, CKI did not inhibit the growth of s.c.
tumors in animals (Fig. 4A), whereas the same total cumulative
dose of CKI reduced skeletal tumor growth (Table 2). Immunohistochemistry of s.c. tumors revealed that cathepsin K was strongly
expressed in B02 cells (Fig. 4A, inset).
Effect of a CKI on breast cancer cell invasion in vitro. Tumor
cell invasion is an early process occurring during breast cancer
bone metastasis formation (2). It involves the degradation of the
basement membrane by tumor-derived proteases. It has previously

been proposed that cathepsin K expressed by prostate cancer cells
may contribute to the invasive potential of these cells (17). We
therefore investigated whether CKI could interfere with breast
cancer cell invasion.
The pharmacokinetic profile of a single dose of 50 mg/kg CKI revealed that concentrations in the bone marrow reached 105 mol/L.
CKI concentrations in the range of 107 to 104 mol/L were therefore chosen to study the effect of the drug on B02 cell invasion
in vitro. As shown in Fig. 4B, CKI dose-dependently inhibited B02
cell invasion through basement membrane Matrigel, reaching halfmaximal inhibitory concentration at 105 mol/L.

Discussion
In breast cancer skeletal metastases, bone destruction is
mediated by osteoclasts (2). Osteoclasts resorb bone by secreting
protons and cathepsin K. Protons dissolve bone mineral and
provide an acidic microenvironment, enabling cathepsin K to
degrade the demineralized collagenous matrix (7). Matrix metalloproteinases are also involved in this resorptive process (18, 19).
However, cathepsin K is a key proteinase in bone resorption (7, 8).
The results presented here first show that cathepsin K is
expressed not only by osteoclasts but also by breast cancer cells.
Similar findings showing the presence of cathepsin K in breast and
prostate cancers have previously been reported (12, 17). In addition,
we found that breast cancer cells in bone metastases overproduced
cathepsin K compared with the expression observed in the primary
tumor and soft tissue metastases of the same patient. Although
more patients with advanced cancer need to be investigated to
clearly address this question, our results are in accordance with the
osteomimicry theory (20, 21), suggesting that cancers metastasizing
to bone must express bone-related genes to grow and thrive in the
bone microenvironment. Because cathepsin K was expressed by
osteoclasts and bone-residing breast cancer cells, we therefore
reasoned that a therapeutic approach using a CKI could be an
effective way to treat breast cancer bone metastases.
Our results show that a clinically relevant dose of CKI substantially reduced osteolysis in two different mouse models of breast
cancer bone metastasis. Moreover, we showed that CKI therapy
produced meaningful antitumor effects in bone. We surmise that
this reduction of skeletal tumor burden is due to the antiresorptive
activity of CKI, which, in turn, deprives breast cancer cells of bonederived growth factors that are required for tumor growth. This
assumption is first supported by our finding that the preventive
dosing regimen of CKI that inhibited skeletal tumor burden did
not inhibit the growth of s.c. tumor xenografts in animals. Moreover,
using the experimental model of B02 breast cancer bone metastasis,
we found that CKI had a similar inhibitory effect on skeletal tumor
burden in the treatment and preventive protocols. Yet, B02 cells
residing at the bone metastatic site did express cathepsin K. If a
decreased skeletal tumor burden on CKI therapy was the result of a
combined effect of the drug on B02 cells and osteoclasts, we would
have expected the preventive dosing regimen to have inhibited
skeletal tumor burden more effectively than what we observed. Our
results are therefore reminiscent of those obtained in different
mouse models of bone metastasis in which it was found that
osteoprotegerin, a direct inactivator of osteoclasts, causes a
reduction of skeletal tumor burden, whereas it does not inhibit the
growth of tumor cells in soft tissues (22–25). Thus, it is most likely
that CKI renders the bone a less favorable microenvironment for
tumor growth by inhibiting osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.

The function of cathepsin K in breast cancer cells is currently
unknown. Our results show that CKI inhibited B02 cell invasion
in vitro, suggesting that cathepsin K could contribute to the
invasive potential of B02 breast cancer cells. As discussed above,
the clinical dosing regimen of CKI that we used did not, however,
exhibit direct antitumor activity in vivo. Perhaps, a higher dosing of
CKI would have been required to target tumor-derived cathepsin K
in vivo. However, given that bone turnover in rodents is three to
five times higher than in humans (26), we chose to use a dose of
50 mg/kg (twice daily) CKI that corresponds to a realistic clinical
situation. We anticipate that higher doses of CKI, which are well
above the current clinical dosing regimens, could generate side
effects. For example, in a recent placebo-controlled trial, 5-, 10-, 25-,
and 50-mg daily doses of a CKI (balicatib) or placebo were given to
675 postmenopausal women with osteopenia/osteoporosis, and the
results obtained at 12 months show that balicatib increases the
bone mineral density (27). However, there was a higher incidence of
skin adverse events (mainly pruritus) with a daily dose of 50-mg
balicatib (27).
Our contention that drugs like CKI should be used in preclinical
studies at doses relevant to human clinical testing is reminiscent of
the use of bisphosphonates in preclinical studies, in which high
doses of these drugs not only reduce skeletal tumor burden by
inhibiting bone resorption but also exhibit direct antitumor activity
(28). There is much debate about the clinical relevance of these
experimental findings because high doses of bisphosphonates are
not feasible in humans as a result of concerns about renal toxicity
(1). Moreover, the bisphosphonate dosing regimens that have been
approved for the treatment of cancer patients with skeletal
metastases to date have shown no convincing antitumor effects
(1). In this respect, using our mouse model of B02 breast cancer
bone metastasis, we have recently reported that a single dose of 100
Ag/kg zoledronic acid, calculated to be equivalent to the 4-mg i.v.
dose given to patients, does not inhibit skeletal tumor burden (16).
We confirmed here that tumor-bearing mice that were treated with
a single clinically relevant dose of 100 Ag/kg zoledronic acid had
less bone destruction, but not less skeletal tumor burden, than
vehicle-treated animals. By contrast, if zoledronic acid is administered at a low dosage over shorter treatment intervals, the same
total cumulative dose of 100 Ag/kg zoledronic acid does exhibit
direct antitumor activity (16). For instance, we have shown that a
weekly dosing regimen of 50 Ag/kg zoledronic acid substantially
reduces skeletal tumor burden. These results are explained by the
prolonged exposure of the bone marrow to the bisphosphonate,
enabling a direct effect on tumor cells that reside in bone (16). It
is interesting that Kim et al. (29) recently reported that zoledronic
acid (used at a dosage of 25 Ag/kg, twice daily) in combination with
imatinib (a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor) and paclitaxel (a
chemotherapeutic agent) produced a significant preservation of
bone structure and decreased skeletal tumor burden in experimental bone metastasis of human prostate cancer when compared
with each individual drug separately. Because CKI and zoledronic
acid have different molecular targets in osteoclasts (9–11), we used
them as a combination therapy in the hope that a greater inhibitory activity on the progression of established bone metastases
might be attainable. We found that a single dose of 100 Ag/kg zoledronic acid did not statistically significantly improve the efficacy
of CKI on inhibition of tumor-induced osteolysis and skeletal
tumor burden. Conversely, a weekly dosing regimen of 50 Ag/kg
zoledronic acid was so effective at inhibiting skeletal tumor burden
when used as a single-agent therapy that the combination with CKI

did not further decrease the tumor burden (unpublished results).
Although doses and schedules of administration of CKI and
zoledronic acid need to be optimized, our results suggest that
combination therapy might be an effective way to maximize the
antiresorptive (and antitumor) effects of these drugs.
In conclusion, our preclinical study shows for the first time that
a CKI reduces breast cancer–induced osteolysis and skeletal tumor
burden. Our findings also support a promising future for the use of
CKIs in combination with other molecularly targeted antiosteoclastic agents in the treatment of experimental bone metastases
and, perhaps, in the treatment of breast cancer patients with
advanced disease.
