ABSTRACT
Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) promoter hypermethylation has been frequently
observed in colorectal cancer (CRC). The association between APC promoter methylation
and clinicopathological significance in CRC is under investigation. We performed a
meta-analysis to quantitatively evaluate the significance of APC methylation in CRC.
The study included a total of 24 articles and 2025 CRC patients. The frequency of
APC promoter hypermethylation was significantly higher in colorectal adenoma than
in normal colorectal tissue, OR was 5.76, 95% CI, 2.45-13.56; p<0.0001, I2=0%.
APC promoter more frequently hypermethylated in CRC stage I compared to normal
colorectal tissue, OR was 13.42, 95% CI, 3.66-49.20; p<0.0001, I2=31%. The risk
of incidence of CRC was significantly correlated to APC promoter hypermethylation,
pooled OR was 9.80, 95%CI, 6.07-15.81; p<0.00001, I2=43%. APC methylation was
not associated with grade, stage of CRC as well as tumor location, patients’ gender, and
smoking behavior. The results indicate that APC promoter hypermethylation is an early
event in carcinogenesis of CRC, could be a valuable diagnostic marker for early-stage
CRC. APC methylation is not significantly associated with overall survival in patients
with CRC. APC is a potential drug target for development of personalized treatment.

prevent CRC-related mortality. During last decade, epigenetic
alterations have been reported to play an important role in many
cancers initiation, progression, and metastasis [1, 2]. DNA
methylation within CpG island in promoter region of genes is
associated with the loss of gene expression and is observed in
many types of cancers including CRC. Adenomatous polyposis
coli (APC), a suppressor gene, is located at chromosomal band
5q21-q22 and consists of 15 exons. APC was discovered by
genetic linkage analysis in familial adenomatous polyposis
(FAP) and was reported by Kinzler [3], Nishisho [4], Joslyn

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common
types of cancer worldwide and results from the accumulation
of genetic and epigenetic alterations in colonic mucosa cells,
which ultimately leads to colorectal adenoma, advanced to
invasive and metastatic CRC. Unfortunately, the prognosis
of CRC in late stages is still poor and the search of novel
diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers is highly desired to

The frequency of APC promoter hypermethylation
was similar between low and high grade of CRC,
pooled OR was 1.01, 95%CI, 039-2.61; p=0.99, I2=81%
(Figure 5). There was no difference when comparing the
frequency of APC promoter hypermethylation between I/
II stage and III/IV stage of CRC, pooled OR was 0.85,
95%CI, 0.63-1.15; p=0.29, I2=0% (Figure 6).
3. There was no statistically significant association
between APC methylation status and other clinical
parameters, including tumor location, gender and smoking
status of CRC patients.
Proximal versus distal: OR was 0.87, 95%CI, 0.671.13, p=0.31, I2=0% (Figure 7).
Male versus female: OR was 1.55, 95%CI, 0.881.52, p=0.31, I2=0% (Figure 8).
Smoker versus non-smoker: OR was 1.63, 95%CI,
0.88-2.99, p=0.12, I2=0% (Figure 9).
4. Overall survival was analyzed by selecting
Colorectal Adenocarcinoma (TCGA, Nature 2012)
[10] and gene APC via cBioPortal for provisional
data. The survival curve was plotted on 236 cases
(methylation HM27) which included 72 cases with APC
hypermethylation (methylation beta-value was more
than 0.3) and 164 cases with APC low methylation
(methylation beta-value was more than 0.3). T-test
p-value was 0.5798, indicating APC methylation was not
significantly associated with overall survival in patients
with CRC (Figure 10).

[5] and Groden [6]. Recently APC is thought of as a negative
regulator in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Loss of APC
function leads to the destabilization and degradation of betacatenin, and the nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin results
in the activation of T-cell factor/LEF target gene and initiates
tumorgenesis [7, 8]. APC along with several other inactivated
genes plays a prognostic indicatory role in squamous cell and
adenocarcinoma of esophagus, bladder and lung cancers [9].
In the past two decades, APC promoter hypermethylation was
frequently observed in sporadic and familial CRC. However,
the association between clinicopathological significance and
APC methylation was under investigated. The present article
aims to summarize the most recent findings concerning the use
of epigenetic (mainly related to DNA methylation) biomarkers
for CRC diagnosis, progression, and response to treatment.

RESULTS
Identification of relevant studies
36 publications were identified by the search method
as described above. Eleven of those were excluded due
to laboratory studies, non-original articles (review), or
studies irrelevant to the current analysis. Eventually, there
were 24 studies included in the final meta-analysis as
shown in Figure 1.

Study characteristics

Sensitivity analyses and publication bias

24 studies published from 2004 to 2015 were eligible
for meta-analysis. A total of 1396 samples including CRC,
colorectal adenoma and normal control tissues from Greece,
Iran, Sweden, Vietnam, China, South Korea, Japan, UK,
Kashmir, Czech Republic, Australia, Netherland, Germany,
Norway, and USA were included in the analysis. Their basic
characteristics are summarized in Table 1.

To minimize the effect of confounders, a sensitivity
analysis, in which one study was removed at a time, was
conducted to assess the result stability. The pooled ORs
were not significantly changed, indicating the stability of
our analyses. The funnel plots demonstrates no obvious
asymmetry (Figure 11A-11H), suggesting the absence
of publication biases in the meta-analysis of APC
hypermethylation and clinicopathological features.

clinicopathological features

DISCUSSION

1. The inactivation of APC through promoter
hypermethylation in adenoma and CRC.
APC promoter hypermethylation was an
early event in carcinogenesis. The frequency of
APC promoter hypermethylation was significantly
increased in adenoma than in normal colorectal
tissues, OR was 5.76, 95%CI, 2.45-13.56; p<0.0001,
I2=0% (Figure 2). APC promoter was more frequently
hypermethylated in CRC stage I than normal
colorectal tissue, OR was 13.42, 95% CI, 3.66-49.20;
p<0.0001, I2=31% (Figure 3). The risk of incidence
of CRC was significantly correlated to APC promoter
hypermethylation, pooled OR was 9.80, 95%CI,
6.07-15.81; p<0.00001, I2=43% (Figure 4).
2. APC promoter hypermethylation was not
associated with grade and stage of CRC.

CRC is thought to develop from adenomatous
polyps following the accumulation of mutations which
includes the activation of oncogenes and the inactivation
of tumor suppressor genes [11–15]. Tumor suppressor
genes associated with CRC include APC, p53, BRAF and
DCC [10, 15], and the loss of APC has been observed
in approximately 70-80% of CRC [16–19], but the
association between APC promoter methylation and
clinicopathological significance in CRC is unclear. The
current study systematically reviewed all published
evidence before July 2016 and synthesized data from
three studies and 196 adenoma samples using a metaanalysis. Our result indicated that the APC promoter is
5.76 times more frequently hypermethylated in adenoma
46469

three studies (Xu et al.) reported low frequency of APC
methylation in CRC (7.7%) compared to other studies
(APC methylation rate arranged from 17.9% to 62.8%),
two studies (Dimberg at al. and Michailidi et al.) reported
high rate of APC methylation (65.3% and 85.7%) in
normal colorectal tissues compared to other studies
(APC methylation rate arranged 0-25%). The frequency
of APC hypermethylation was similar between CRC
and adenoma (data not shown), this result is consistent
with previous study [21]. Our results suggest that APC
promoter hypermethylation is an early event during
colorectal carcinogenesis. Previous evidence suggest
that APC methylation is not a “second hit” in two hit
model of APC mutation in tumor [22]. This explains
why APC promoter hypermethylation was an early event
during the development of CRC. As the changes in APC
promoter hypermethylation are reversible, demethylation
with drug could delay carcinogenesis and progression of
CRC. Previous studies showed that adenoma formation
in APC min/+ was inhibited by 5-aza-deoxycitidine,

than in normal colorectal tissue. In addition, the frequency
of APC hypermethylation in CRC stage I was 13.42
times higher than in normal colorectal tissue. Patients
with early-stage CRC could expect a long survival with
surgery alone, but about 50% stage III and 25% stage
II will relapse and need adjuvant chemotherapy [20].
Therefore, APC hypermethylation as a valuable early
diagnostic marker could contribute to making the decision
whether or not to accomplish chemotherapy. Ding et al
published a meta-analysis of the association between APC
promoter methylation and colorectal cancer, in which the
APC promoter hypermethylation has not been analyzed in
early-stage CRC.
We pooled 12 studies and included 762 CRC
samples and 343 normal colorectal tissues, and the data
demonstrated the frequency of APC hypermethylation in
CRC was 9.8 times higher than in normal colorectal tissues;
the heterogeneity was 43%. We removed three studies
that caused higher heterogeneity (the heterogeneity was
83%, OR was 4.35, 95% CI was 1.56-12.12). One of the

a demethylation agent [23]. In addition, Eads et al
demonstrated that the expression of full-length Dnmt3b1
enhanced the number of colon tumors in APC min/+ mice
by approximately twofold and increased the average size of
colonic microadenomas [24, 25]. Taken together, APC is a
potential drug target for the development of personalized
therapy in patients with CRC; further investigation is
required in future.
Among the included studies, the frequency of APC
methylation have varied greatly from 17.9% to 62.8%.
This phenomenon maybe due to ethnic differences,
different PCR primers used in the detection, as well as
cancer heterogeneity. According to recent classification
system, CRC is classified into two major groups: 1)
hypermutated cancers with either microsatellite instability
due to defective mismatch repair or ultramutated
cancers with DNA polymerase epsilon proofreading
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mutations; 2) non-hypermutated, microsatellite stable
cancers with a high frequency of DNA somatic copy
number alterations, which showed common mutations
in APC, TP53, KRAS, SMAD4 and PIK3CA. APC
methylation is present more often in the first group of
tumors with microsatellite-stable compared to the second
group with microsatellite instability [26–29]. In addition,
the APC methylation was inversely associated with TIMP3,
TP53 and BRAF methylation [27]. Previous publications
reported that APC was less frequently mutated alone, more
commonly mutated with KRAS, TP53, PIK3CA and SMAD
[22, 27], suggesting that the APC mutation occurs early in
carcinogenesis, the alterations of other genes were involved
during the transition from adenoma to carcinoma. APC
methylation combined with the mutation of other genes
could be a valuable biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis
of CRC. Further study is necessary to substantiate this issue.

We pooled seven studies and included 964
samples and analyzed the relationship of APC promoter
methylation with the grade of CRC; the power was 0.89,
which indicated that APC promoter hypermethylation is
not associated with grade. Furthermore, present analysis
showed that APC promoter hypermethylation is not
correlated with stages of CRC, since the power of the

study is small, further study with a larger number of
samples is need to confirm this relationship.
Consistent results were shown in sensitivity
analyses, indicating the stability of our analyses. All funnel
plots did not show any obvious asymmetry, suggesting
there is no publication bias in the meta-analysis. This
study has several potential limitations. First, selection bias

may exist since only publications in English and Chinese
were included in the present study, which could affect
the accuracy of results in certain extent. Caution should
be taken when our findings are interpreted. Second, the
possibility of information, selection biases and unidentified
confounders could not be completely excluded because
all of the included studies were observational. Third,
our results showed that there is no significant correlation
between APC methylation and gender, smoking behavior
of CRC patients as well as tumor locations; since the
power of the study is small, further evaluation with a
larger number of samples is required in future.
In summary, our meta-analysis indicates that
APC promoter hypermethylation is an early event of
carcinogenesis of CRC, and APC methylation combined

with the mutation of other genes could be a valuable
biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of CRC. APC
promoter methylation is not significantly associated with
overall survival in patients with CRC. APC is a potential
drug target for development of personalized therapy.

Statistical analysis
Review Manage 5.3 from the Cochrane
Collaboration was used for data analysis. Odds Ratio
with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). This statistic was
complemented with the I2 statistic, which quantifies the
proportion of the cumulative variation across studies
that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance. When
heterogeneity was not an issue (I2 values <50%), a fixed
effect model was used to calculate parameters. When there
was substantial heterogeneity (I2 values ≥50%), a randomeffects model was used to pool data and attempt to identify
potential sources of heterogeneity based on subgroup
analyses. Two sided statistical tests and p-value were used.

Study selection
Studies were included if they met the following
inclusion criteria: 1) investigation APC methylation
status and clinicopathological significance in CRC. 2)
case-control, and cohort studies published as original
studies. 3) studies that provided sufficient data to calculate
ORs and 95% confidence interval (CI).
Exclusion criteria were: 1) lack of sufficient data
on APC methylation and clinicopathological features in
CRC, 2) reviews, case report, conference abstract and
expert opinion and letters, 3) all publications regarding in
vitro studies.

Evaluation for publication bias
The presence of publication bias was assessed
by funnel plots of logarithm of odds ratios versus their
standard errors [32].

Quality assessment

Author contributions

The quality of each study was individually evaluated
by each investigator utilizing Newcastle-Ottawa quality
assessment scale [31]. All observational studies were
considered moderate to high quality, with median
Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale of 7 (range,
6-9) (data not shown).
