Abstract
Vaccines that can coordinately induce multi-epitope T cell–
mediated immunity, T helper functions, and immunologic
memory may offer effective tools for cancer immunotherapy.
Here, we report the development of a new class of recombinant
protein cancer vaccines that deliver different CD8þ and CD4þ
T-cell epitopes presented by MHC class I and class II alleles,
respectively. In these vaccines, the recombinant protein is fused
with Z12, a novel cell-penetrating peptide that promotes efﬁcient protein loading into the antigen-processing machinery of
dendritic cells. Z12 elicited an integrated and multi-epitopic

immune response with persistent effector T cells. Therapy with
Z12-formulated vaccines prolonged survival in three robust
tumor models, with the longest survival in an orthotopic
model of aggressive brain cancer. Analysis of the tumor sites
showed antigen-speciﬁc T-cell accumulation with favorable
modulation of the balance of the immune inﬁltrate. Taken
together, the results offered a preclinical proof of concept for
the use of Z12-formulated vaccines as a versatile platform for
the development of effective cancer vaccines. Cancer Res; 75(15);

Introduction

ing cells (APC), such as dendritic cells (DC), without the limitation of restriction to a single MHC allele. Another strength is longlasting epitope presentation recently described in DCs loaded
with proteins (5). Furthermore, proteins require uptake and
processing by DCs to achieve MHC restricted presentation of
their constituent epitopes. This reduces the risk of inducing
peripheral tolerance as has been shown after vaccination with
short peptides that do not have such stringent processing requirements (6). However, most soluble proteins are generally degraded
in endolysosomes and are poorly cross-presented on MHC class I
molecules and are therefore poorly immunogenic for CD8þ T-cell
responses (7). Several approaches have been developed to
improve protein delivery, including chemically linked antigens
to the B subunit of Shiga toxin (8), cloning with the large
adenylate cyclase from Bordetella pertussis (9) or antigen linked
to anti-DEC-205 antibody (10). The latter was further developed
to a human antibody for clinical use (11). To improve the efﬁcacy
of protein-based vaccine delivery, we propose to use a vector with
a small molecular size, easy to fuse with the antigen and very
versatile. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPP) are peptides of 8 to 40
residues that have the ability to cross the cell membrane and enter
into most cell types (12, 13). Alternatively, they are also called
protein transduction domain (PTD) reﬂecting their origin as
occurring in natural proteins. Recently, a study comparing three
different CPPs (including TAT and polyR) with the antibody
against the DC receptor SIGN demonstrated that polyR is more
potent than TAT to deliver protein to DCs and that similar
antigen presentation was achieved by DCs loaded with either
polyR or the anti-DC-SIGN antibody, at least in vitro (14). Therefore, the interest remains very high to identify a CPP allowing
efﬁcient multi-epitopic antigen delivery for cancer immunotherapies. Recently, a CPP derived from the viral protein ZEBRA
was described to transduce protein cargoes across biologic

The immune system can recognize and to some extent eliminate tumor cells; however, this antitumor response is often of low
amplitude and inefﬁcient. Boosting this weak antitumor response
with therapeutic vaccination has been a long sought goal for
cancer therapy. Different approaches were evaluated in preclinical
and clinical development, including short peptide vaccines (1),
long-peptide vaccines (2), and proteins. For the latter, disappointing phase III clinical trial results in melanoma and non–small cell
lung cancer indicate that ideal protein vaccines and protocols have
yet to be established (3, 4). Nevertheless, in these clinical trials,
lack of clinical efﬁcacy was not attributed to the protein nature of
the vaccine per se, which if properly formulated, presents many
advantages. Indeed, protein can potentially allow multi-epitopic
(CD8þ and CD4þ epitopes) antigen delivery to antigen-present1

membranes by both direct translocation and lipid raft-mediated
endocytosis (15). We hypothesized that these two mechanisms of
entry should promote both MHC class I and II restricted presentation of cargo antigens to CD8þ and CD4þ T cells, respectively.
Therefore, we investigated whether this CPP (here called Z12, or
its variant called Z13) was able to deliver multi-epitopic peptides
to DCs, and subsequently to promote CTL and Th cell activation
and antitumor function. To achieve this, we engineered a new
generation recombinant vaccine by fusing a CPP to a multiantigenic protein. This novel chimeric protein was efﬁciently
delivered to APCs and led to multi-epitopic MHC class I and II
restricted presentation. Our vaccine promoted an integrated
immune response with persistent CD8þ effector T cells homing
to the tumor site, Th1 polarized CD4þ T cells as well as potent
antitumor immunity in different tumor models, including
glioma.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
The DC line 2114 was derived from spleen tumors in CD11c:
SV40LgT-transgenic C57BL/6 mice (16); it resembles normal
splenic CD8a conventional DCs, but is grown in normal culture
medium without addition of cytokines: IMDM-GlutaMax supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 10 mmol/L HEPES, 50
mmol/L b-mercaptoethanol, 50 U/mL penicillin, and 50 mg/L
streptomycin (all from Life Technologies). All tumor lines are
syngeneic to C57BL/6 mice. GL261-QUAD is a transfectant of the
GL261 mouse astrocytoma expressing multiple model antigens,
including chicken ovalbumin (OVA)257–264 (presented by Kb)
and OVA323–339 (presented by I-Ab), and was kindly provided by
J. Ohlfest (University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN); it has
previously been described (17). For survival experiments, tumorigenicity of the line was enhanced by prior in vitro selection using
cycles of coculture of glioma cells with normal C57BL/6 splenocytes in culture medium containing 100 IU/mL human recombinant IL2 (Novartis). Subsequently, GL261-QUAD was cultured
in DMEM-GlutaMax, 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 10 mmol/L
HEPES, with 1 mg/mL puromycin and 500 mg/mL of G418 to
maintain expression of the transgenes. EG7 is an OVA transfectant
from the EL4 Thymoma cell line. EG7 cells were cultured in RPMIGlutaMax, 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 10 mmol/L HEPES, with
400 mg/mL of G418 to maintain expression of the transgenes. B16LCMV-GP is a lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-GP33–
41 transfectant of B16 melanoma. B16-LCMV-GP cells were cultured in DMEM-GlutaMax, 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 10 mmol/L
HEPES, with 1 mg/mL of G418 to maintain expression of the
transgenes. The cells were treated 48 hours with 50 U/mL IFNg
prior to injection.
Mice
Female C57BL/6J mice (CD45.2) were purchased from Charles
River Laboratories. T-cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice were all
on a C57BL/6 background, but in some cases expressed congenic
markers used for their identiﬁcation after adoptive transfer. P14
transgenic mice that express a TCR directed against MHC class I
restricted epitope (LCMV)-GP33–41 were kindly provided by H.
Pircher (University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany). SMARTA
TCR transgenic mice, expressing a TCR for the MHC II restricted
epitope LCMV-GP61–80 were kindly provided by P. Ohashi (University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada). OT1, OT2, and D011.10

mice express TCR speciﬁc for OVA epitopes (OT1: MHC class I–
restricted OVA257–264; OT2 and DO11.10 MHC class II–restricted
OVA323–339). They were kindly provided by P. Romero (University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland), T. Sch€
uler (Institute of
Immunology, Charite Berlin, Berlin, Germany), or B. Huard
(University of Grenoble, Grenoble, France). All animals used in
this study were between 6 and 12 weeks of age at the time of
experiments. These studies have been reviewed and approved by
the institutional and cantonal veterinary authorities in accordance
with Swiss Federal law on animal protection.
Proliferation tests
Bone marrow–derived DCs (BMDC) were prepared from
C57BL/6 mice as previously described (18), and used at day 9
to 10 of culture as APCs for proliferation tests. Brieﬂy, BMDCs
were loaded with 0.3 mmol/L of the indicated protein or peptide
for 4 hours at 37 C, washed three times, then matured overnight
at 37 C with 100 ng/mL LPS (from Salmonella abortus, equi S-form;
Enzo Life Sciences). Antigen-loaded mature BMDC were then
mixed at a ratio of 1:10 with the indicated TCR transgenic mouse
splenocytes that had been stained with 10 mmol/L 5-(and 6)
carboxyﬂuorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE; Life Technologies). After 5 days coincubation of spleen cells and BMDCs,
antigen-speciﬁc proliferation was assessed by ﬂow cytometry,
measuring CFSE dilution on CD8 and live-gated cells.

Cell preparation
Peripheral blood and spleen mononuclear cell suspensions for
ﬂow cytometry were isolated on lymphocyte separation medium
1077 (GE Healthcare). To obtain brain-inﬁltrating leukocytes
(BIL), mice were transcardially perfused with Ringer's solution
prior to cell isolation, as previously described (19).
In vivo cytotoxicity assay
For target cell preparation for the in vivo cytotoxicity assay,
spleen cells from C57BL/6 CD45.1 congenic mice were pulsed
with 10 mmol/L OVA257–264 peptide (or vehicle control), then
labeled with either CellTrace Violet Proliferation Kit (Life
Technologies), as described in the manufacturer's protocol,
or with CFSE, as described for proliferation tests. They were
injected i.v. and in parallel analyzed by ﬂow cytometry to
determine the input ratio. After 16 hours, splenocytes were
isolated, stained with CD45.1- and CD45.2-speciﬁc antibodies to distinguish transferred cells, and the proportions of
CFSE and Violet-stained target cells were determined by ﬂow
cytometry. Percentage vaccine-induced peptide-speciﬁc in vivo

cytotoxicity was calculated according to the following
formula:
1  [(target þ peptide/target  peptide) vaccinated/input ratio
target  peptide:target þ peptide  (target þ peptide/target 
peptide)na€ve]  100.
Antibodies and ﬂow cytometry
For surface staining, after FcR blocking, the following mAb were
used: CD4 (RMA4-4), CD8 (53-6.7), CD11b (M1/70), CD19
(6D5), CD45.1 (A20), CD45.2 (104), CD62L (Mel-14), Ly6C
(AL21), and Ly6G (1A8) all from BD Biosciences. KLRG1 (2F1/
KLRG1) was from BioLegend. Dead cells were identiﬁed with
LIVE/DEAD yellow ﬂuorescent reactive dye (L34959) from Life
Technologies and were excluded from analyses. MHC-peptide
multimers were from ProImmune, Immudex or P. Guillaume
(University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland). Multimer gating strategy used a dump gate (CD4, CD11b, and CD19) and
excluded dead cells. Intracellular cytokines were stained after
restimulation with the indicated peptides for 6 hours in the
presence of Brefeldin A (GolgiPlug; BD Bioscences) with mAb

were from Caltag. Anti-Foxp3 (FJK-16S) and control isotype were
from eBioscience. Fixation and permeabilization was carried out
using BD Biosciences (for cytokines) and eBioscience (for Granzyme B and Foxp3) kits according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were analyzed using a Gallios ﬂow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) and results were processed with FlowJo (TreeStar,

membrane-bound peptide prior to BMDC transduction, an
acid wash (0.2 mol/L Glycine, 0.15 mol/L NaCl pH 3) was
performed, essential to remove membrane-bound CPPs; omitting this step resulted in higher ﬂuorescence (data not shown),
similar to previous observations using trypsin (21). For the

Results and Discussion
Z12 efﬁciently transports a cargo into the cytosolic
compartment of DCs
Induction of tumor-antigen speciﬁc CD8þ T cells is an essential
requirement of a therapeutic cancer vaccine. To achieve this, the
vaccine vector must deliver antigens into the cytosol, to access the
processing pathway that leads to presentation of immunogenic
peptides on MHC class I molecules. Because CPPs have the
potential to transport cargoes across cellular membranes
(12, 13), we tested whether the 42 residue Z12 fragment of the
ZEBRA CPP (Supplementary Fig. S1) was able to deliver its
cargo to the cytosol of DCs, and subsequently to induce CD8þ
T cells.
Z12 efﬁciently transduced through the cell membrane of
BMDCs (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Around 80% of the cells were

transduced within 4 hours of incubation with 900 nmol/L ﬂuorescein-conjugated Z12 (FAM-Z12-OVALP), with 60% of DCs
transduced with 300 nmol/L of the CPP. The retro-isomer of the
well-described CPP derived from the HIV-Tat (Tat57–49) has been
described to be a better transporter than Tat49–57 (22). We
compared the transduction efﬁcacy in BMDCs of Z13 and
Tat57–49 at concentrations as low as 300 nmol/L (Supplementary
Fig. S3B) and observed a faster and higher transduction efﬁcacy of
Z13 in this experimental setting. Although the mechanism of CPPmediated transduction remains controversial, it is generally
accepted that the dominant pathway is endocytosis (23). Endosomal escape is often essential for biologic activity of the compound transported and can be considered as the limitation of
CPPs in drug development (23). To determine whether Z12
transported its cargo into the cytosol (rather than uniquely the
endosomal compartment), we used the b-lactamase reporter
system and its membrane-permeable substrate (CCF2AM) that
allows monitoring of free cytosolic protein. This reporter system
uses live cells and thereby avoids cell ﬁxation artifacts that could
wrongly indicate cytoplasmic uptake unrelated to CPP function
(21). A direct correlation between protein concentration and
transduction efﬁciency of the 36-kDa cargo was observed (data
not shown), with b-lactamase activity detected with Z12 concentrations as low as 100 nmol/L. At 300 nmol/L of b-lactamase
alone, no cleavage of CCF2AM was observed (data not shown).

A CPP-Based Cancer Vaccine

These data contrast with previous studies reporting inefﬁcient
cargo transduction to the cytosol at low CPP concentrations or
with large molecular cargoes (24). Thus, Z12 as a CPP offers the
advantage of cytosolic antigen delivery without the necessity of
complex modiﬁcations to improve endosomal escape (24).
In order to test whether cytosolic Z12 and its cargo efﬁciently
entered the MHC class I–restricted processing pathway, we loaded
BMDCs with a long peptide composed of 16 residues incorporating the OVA257–264 epitope fused to the CPP (Z12-OVALP;
Supplementary Fig. S1). Processing and presentation of this MHC
I–restricted epitope was monitored by measuring the proliferation of na€ve, monoclonal OVA257-264–speciﬁc CD8þ T cells from
OT1 TCR transgenic mice in vitro. Z12-OVALP–loaded BMDCs
cross-presented the (OVA)257–264 epitope to OT1 T cells, inducing
proliferation that was comparable with either CPP-loaded
BMDCs, or with BMDCs loaded with a saturating concentration
of OVA257–264 peptide (Fig. 1A). This result conﬁrms that Z12 is a
CPP allowing the cytosolic delivery of an antigen that can then be
processed and presented by MHC class I molecules. Although Z12
is highly efﬁcient at transducing DCs delivering cargo antigens for
MHC class I presentation, this has also been shown for other
CPPs, including penetratin (25), LAH4 (26) and TAT (27).
Indeed, based on such observations, some groups have used in
vitro CPP-transduced DCs as vaccine vectors (28). However, for
clinical development, protein vaccination rather than a DC-based
vaccine is a more straightforward option.
To determine whether Z12 could promote cross-presentation in
vivo, by transducing endogenous DCs, we used a stringent ex vivo
assay detecting expansion of the rare endogenous, polyclonal,
OVA-speciﬁc CD8þ T cells. Mice were vaccinated with Z12-OVALP
combined with either the TLR3 agonist Hiltonol, the TLR4 agonist
MPLA, or the TLR7 agonist R848 (Resiquimod) as adjuvants.
In addition, Hiltonol was also tested in combination with an
agonistic anti-CD40 antibody, which has been described to promote APC function (29). Z12-OVALP elicited cross-presentation
in vivo when combined with any of these adjuvants, as evidenced
by OVA257–264–speciﬁc CD8þ T-cell frequency measured by staining with H-2Kb-OVA257-264-multimer staining (Fig. 1B). Notably,
this high magnitude immune response relied principally on Z12
action because vaccination with equimolar amounts of
OVA257–264 long peptide, but without the CPP (OVALP; Supplementary Fig. S1), did not elicit detectable OVA-speciﬁc CD8þ T
cells (Fig. 1B), even after a third vaccination (data not shown). The
potency of Z12-OVALP to prime CD8þ T cells in vivo with only 10
nmol peptide is remarkable. Indeed, a comparable response could
only be achieved by exploiting the unique synergistic properties of
the a-Galactosylceramide adjuvant with the B subunit of Shiga
toxin (8), or with TAT at a concentration of 100 mmol (30).
Z12 vaccination promotes persistent CD8þ T cells with potent
cytotoxic function that home to the tumor site
Persistent effector cells are one of the critical requirements for a
potent cancer vaccine. We therefore monitored the expansion and

persistence of the pool of antigen speciﬁc T cells in the peripheral blood after multiple vaccinations (Fig. 2A). Multimerþ cells
were either signiﬁcantly increased when combined with MPLA
as adjuvant, or maintained with four vaccinations over 6
months when combined with Hiltonol (Fig. 2B). This longterm persistence of OVA257-264–speciﬁc T cells without antiCD40 is particularly noteworthy, because although vaccination
with the OVA257–264 short synthetic peptide can be efﬁcient, the
response was reported to be short lived without anti-CD40
antibody (31). In our experiments, there was a reduction of the
frequency of these OVA-speciﬁc CD8þ T cells in blood when
anti-CD40 antibody was combined with Hiltonol (Fig. 2B),
although this may be a consequence of the rat origin of this
antibody. Despite the overall reduction in multimerþ cells, it is
possible that anti-CD40 antibody induces more central or
effector memory T-cell populations (32). Consistent with this
hypothesis, we observed elevated proportions of a central
memory-like population within the multimerþ CD8þ T cells
(CD62Lþ KLRG1) in mice injected with Hiltonol and antiCD40 antibody (Supplementary Fig. S4A); these cells would be
expected to accumulate in secondary lymphoid tissues. As
expected, most antigen-speciﬁc T cells displayed an effector
phenotype with expression of KLRG1 and absence of the lymph
node homing receptor CD62L (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Next,
we assessed cytotoxic function of the persistent effector cells by
performing an in vivo killing experiment 7 weeks after the last
vaccination. Peptide-speciﬁc cytotoxicity of 47% to 90% was
observed in the spleen after 16 hours (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig. S5). Thus, even mice with only modest proportions of
speciﬁc CD8þ T cells measured by multimer analysis in the
periphery (Fig. 2B) may exhibit robust cytotoxic function in the
tissue (Fig. 2C).
Polyclonal immune response against gp100 self-antigen after
Z13 vaccination
Next, we assessed whether our CPP could elicit an immune
response against the self-/tumor-associated antigen gp100. On
the basis of the results described in the previous section, we
used three vaccinations when Hiltonol was used as adjuvant
and four vaccinations with MPLA (Fig. 3A and B), using
equimolar amounts of short peptides as control. At sacriﬁce,
the gp100-speciﬁc immune response was ﬁrst assessed by ELISPOT (data not shown), and then after one week of restimulation using MHC-peptide multimer staining. The short peptides did not elicit any gp100-speciﬁc immune response with
any adjuvant used (Fig. 3), whereas all mice vaccinated with
Z13-OVACD4gp100CD8 and Hiltonol were positive for gp100speciﬁc T cells. Vaccination with Z13-OVACD4gp100CD8 and
MPLA as adjuvant elicited still induced a gp100-speciﬁc
immune response in 3 of 4 mice (Fig. 3B), but potency was
less with this adjuvant. Thus, our CPP-based vaccine is able to
elicit immune response against the challenging self-/tumorassociated-antigen gp100.

Z12 vaccination promotes effector CD8þ T cells homing to the
tumor site
An effective cancer vaccine must induce T-cell homing to the
tumor site. We tested whether this occurred after vaccination with
the OVA-containing vector Z12-MultiE (Supplementary Fig. S1)
in the orthotopic GL261 murine glioma model. Tumor-bearing
mice were vaccinated twice with Z12-MultiE (Fig. 4A), and the
BILs were then isolated and analyzed (Fig. 4B). Although a low but
signiﬁcant proportion of antigen-speciﬁc T cells was observed in
peripheral blood (up to 1.2% of CD8þ T cells), there was a very
high accumulation of antigen-speciﬁc T cells in the BILs, with a
mean value of 39.8% of CD8þ T cells staining with the H-2KbOVA257-264-multimer. This efﬁcient accumulation of T cells in the
tumor bed could be related to the adjuvant we used, because
Hiltonol was previously shown to promote T-cell homing to the
brain in glioma-bearing mice through the expression of CXCL10
at the tumor site, and VLA-4 and CXCR3 on T cells (33, 34). In the
GL261-QUAD glioma model, there is also a signiﬁcant spontaneous antitumor immune response detectable in nonvaccinated
mice (Fig. 4B). Nevertheless, after two vaccinations with Z12MultiE the frequency of OVA257–264-speciﬁc cells CD8þ T cells in
the BILs was doubled, with OVA-speciﬁc cells representing the
majority of the CD8þ T cells in some vaccinated mice. Thus, as
discussed for cytotoxicity measured in the spleen, immune
responses measured in the target tissue (here the critical tumor
site) may be orders of magnitude higher than those observed in
the blood. However, although speciﬁc T cells inﬁltrating the
tumor site are a necessary component of an efﬁcacious cancer
vaccine, they are not sufﬁcient for antitumor function unless they
can maintain their function within the immunosuppressive
tumor microenvironment (19). We therefore assessed whether
and how vaccination with Z12 inﬂuences the balance of tumorinﬁltrating leukocytes. A signiﬁcant change in the CD4:CD8 ratio
was observed, with an increased inﬁltration of KLRG1þ, granzyme
Bþ effector T cells (Supplementary Fig. S6A–S6C). Furthermore,
Foxp3þ CD4þ regulatory T cells (Treg; Fig. 4C) were signiﬁcantly
reduced in BILs after Z12-mediated vaccination. In a recent study,
poly-IC (as well as CpG-ODN) were reported to be favorable
adjuvants to use with peptide vaccination to improve the antigenspeciﬁc T effector:Treg ratio in tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes
using adoptively transferred monoclonal T cells (35). Thus, our
results with a polyclonal immune response conﬁrm the interest of
a TLR3 agonist (Hiltonol in our study) in conjunction with the
Z12 CPP-based vaccine. We validated the importance of these
vaccination-induced phenotypic changes by measuring antigenspeciﬁc IFN-g and TNFa expression by T cells in BILs from tumorbearing mice; 53.3% of CD8þ T cells from vaccinated mice were
cytokine positive, whereas only 7.3% of nonvaccinated mice
expressed IFN-g and/or TNFa (Supplementary Fig. S7A). Overall,
the expression of effector cytokines was signiﬁcantly lower in the
control group as compared with the vaccinated mice (Supplementary Fig. S7B). Thus, although antigen-speciﬁc CD8þ T cells
were clearly present in the BILs of nonvaccinated tumor-bearing
mice (Fig. 4B), these cells were functionally impaired unless
rescued by Z12-MultiE vaccination. An additional factor that
could explain the potency of Z12 vaccination is the presence of
protumoral myeloid cells within the brain tumor microenvironment. Indeed, we observed that the prominent CD45highCD11bþ
population present in BILs of most nonvaccinated mice was often
greatly diminished in vaccinated animals (Fig. 4D and Supplementary Fig. S6D); monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells

3028 Cancer Res; 75(15) August 1, 2015

(MDSC) were particularly affected by vaccination (Fig. 4E and
Supplementary Fig. S6E). Intriguingly, the proportions of
CD11bhigh cells were inversely correlated with H-2Kb-OVA257–
þ
CD8 T cells (Fig. 4F). Using the same glioma
264-multimer
model, modulation of Gr1-expressing CD11bþ cells with antiCD40 was recently reported to promote type I immunity and
reduce Treg cells, but principally when combined with COX-2
blockade (36). Moreover, protumoral myeloid cells are considered to be associated with malignancy in human glioma (37). Our
data suggest that a Z12-based vaccine adjuvanted with Hiltonol
and anti-CD40 antibody impacts on protumoral myeloid cells in
glioma. This mechanism may contribute to the robust and longlasting effector response, and accumulation of tumor-speciﬁc
CD8þ T cells within the tumor site that we observe.
Z12 delivers antigenic cargo to both MHC class I and MHC class
II processing pathways
Optimal antitumor immunity is associated with both CD4þ
and CD8þ T-cell responses (38, 39). To determine whether
this could be achieved with our CPP-based vaccine, we used
Z12 to deliver recombinant OVA protein (Z12-OVA, Supplementary Fig. S1) to BMDCs in a T-cell proliferation assay.
We observed proliferation of both CD8þ and CD4þ OVAspeciﬁc T cells from OT-1 and OT-2 TCR transgenic mice,
respectively. This indicates that Z12 is able to transport protein
into both MHC class I and II processing compartments of
BMDCs (data not shown). In order to target cancer cells
with heterogeneous antigen expression, a cancer vaccine
should ideally stimulate multiple speciﬁcities of tumor-speciﬁc CD4þ and CD8þ T cells; we therefore engineered Z12MultiE carrying ﬁve different T-cell epitopes (Supplementary
Fig. S1) to test this. We loaded BMDCs with Z12-MultiE and
ﬁrst assessed multi-epitopic presentation of the three CD8þ
epitopes and two CD4þ epitopes in vitro. All epitopes were
presented (albeit with varying efﬁciency), based on proliferative responses of TCR transgenic T cells speciﬁc for each of
the antigens (Fig. 5A). The capacity to target multiple tumor
antigens is essential to avoid outgrowth of antigen negative
tumor cells, as has been reported in a clinical trial targeting a
single epitope of EGFRvIII in glioblastome (40).
To demonstrate Z12-mediated multi-epitopic cargo delivery
to professional APCs in vivo, we adoptively transferred CFSE
labeled na€ve T cells from the respective TCR transgenic mice for
each MHC restricting allele before vaccination. The multi-epitopic cargo was efﬁciently processed and presented by endogenous APCs in vivo, inducing proliferation of adoptively transferred P14 and OT1 CD8þ T cells and SMARTA CD4þ T cells
from TCR transgenic mice (Fig. 5B). Therefore, Z12-MultiE
vaccination facilitates delivery of peptide epitopes in the cargo
to all of the MHC class I and class II alleles expressed in C57BL/
6 mice (H-2 Kb, Db, IAb). Development of CPPs such as Z12 for
human glioma therapy, with antigen cargoes restricted by
different MHC alleles would be an attractive approach to
circumvent the reported capacity of glioblastoma cells for MHC
downregulation, in which selective HLA-A2 loss was observed
in many tumors (41).

A CPP-Based Cancer Vaccine

responses were detected to all three CD8þ T cell epitopes
incorporated in the Z12-MultiE protein (Fig. 6A), including
the self-/tumor-associated antigen gp100. The Z12-based vaccine elicited antigen-speciﬁc CD8þ and CD4 T cells expressing
TNFa and IFNg (Fig. 6B; refs. 38, 42) but no IL4 expression
(data not shown), conﬁrming induction of functional MHC
class I- and II–restricted T cells with type I polarization. Evidence from animal models (38, 42) as well as clinical trials (43)
points to the importance of type I immune response for brain
tumor immunotherapy. To determine the therapeutic impact of
our vaccination approach, we treated mice with three different
tumor models: EG7 thymoma, B16 melanoma and GL261
astrocytoma. Although EG7 are OVA transfected, these tumors
are aggressive (median survival of 20–23 days: Fig. 7A–C). We
treated the mice in this challenging therapeutic window, vaccinations starting 5 days after tumor implantation. As expected
from previous studies, the long peptide vaccine displayed a
higher efﬁcacy compared with short peptides, with an increase
of the median survival to 24 days (44). Adding Z13 to the long
peptide vaccine resulted in a signiﬁcant increase of the median
survival to 30 days (Fig. 7A). Similar results were obtained by
targeting the LCMV-GP33–41 viral antigen expressed by B16LCMV-GP melanoma cells, with median survival extending
from 31.5 days in nontreated mice to 38 days in mice receiving
two vaccinations (Fig. 7C). Our CPP not only improved the
modest efﬁcacy of long-peptide based vaccines (Fig. 7A and B)
but it also converted an inefﬁcacious protein vaccine into a
therapy with highly signiﬁcant clinical beneﬁt (Fig. 7E and F).
Moreover, in a challenging brain tumor model, we treated mice
bearing orthotopic GL261-QUAD brain tumors with a Z12based protein vaccine: this induced a very potent and durable
therapeutic effect. Indeed, long-term survival up to 100 days
was observed in vaccinated mice (Fig. 7G). Surviving vaccinated
mice (7 of 8) sacriﬁced at this time point were totally asymptomatic and had no macroscopic evidence of tumor. Therefore,
the in vitro predicted CPP properties of Z12, together with
favorable modulation of multiple elements of the immune
inﬁltrate that we observed, are fully validated in a therapeutic
vaccination setting, with induction of durable antitumor
immunity in an orthotopic glioma model.

Concluding Remarks
Therapeutic cancer vaccines must all exploit the potential of
DCs to elicit tumor-speciﬁc T cells. Our design and development
of a therapeutic cancer vaccine based on a Z12 or Z13 fused to a
multi-epitopic protein has overcome many shortcomings of previous CPPs (28) or protein-based vaccines. Namely, the Z12/Z13
facilitates induction of a robust integrated immune response,
comprising both CD4þ and CD8þ T cells. For anticancer immune
responses, this is a major advance over the previously reported
CD4þ T cell-bias for protein vaccines (45). Moreover, eliciting a
multi-epitopic response with a protein rather than minimal
peptide epitopes offers the opportunity for generating peptides
binding to multiple MHC alleles. An additional strength of
protein-based vaccines in contrast to short peptides is the requirement for antigen processing, thus reducing the risk of peripheral
tolerance induction (2). Moreover, providing antigen in a protein
form may promote sustained stimulation of T cells through
intracellular antigen depots in DCs (5). On the basis of our in
vivo data, Z12/Z13 is strongly immunostimulatory. Indeed, our

www.aacrjournals.org

Z12 CPP-based vaccine induces durable immune responses and
shows therapeutic efﬁcacy even in different tumor models, including a challenging orthotopic brain tumor model. Moreover, this
robust therapeutic effect did not require additional treatment
modalities such as checkpoint blockade, cell transfer, local delivery to the tumor bed, or approaches to dampen local or systemic
immunosuppression (46). Although ultimate clinical efﬁcacy
may beneﬁt from such approaches, it will be advantageous to
move toward rapid clinical development with a vaccine vector
that is sufﬁciently potent to have clinical impact even as a
monotherapy. The unique properties of Z12/Z13 and its capacity
to stimulate powerful and broad antitumor immunity against an
aggressive glioma in the challenging site of the CNS conﬁrms its
potential to be a key component of next generation cancer
immunotherapies.
