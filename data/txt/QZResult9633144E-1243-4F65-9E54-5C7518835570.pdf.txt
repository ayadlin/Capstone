Activation of the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor AhR Promotes
Retinoic Acid–Induced Differentiation of Myeloblastic
Leukemia Cells by Restricting Expression of the Stem Cell
Transcription Factor Oct4
Rodica P. Bunaciu and Andrew Yen

Abstract
Retinoic acid (RA) is used to treat leukemia and other cancers through its ability to promote cancer cell
differentiation. Strategies to enhance the anticancer effects of RA could deepen and broaden its beneficial
therapeutic applications. In this study, we describe a receptor cross-talk system that addresses this issue. RA
effects are mediated by RAR/RXR receptors that we show are modified by interactions with the aryl hydrocarbon
receptor (AhR), a protein functioning both as a transcription factor and a ligand-dependent adaptor in an
ubiquitin ligase complex. RAR/RXR and AhR pathways cross-talk at the levels of ligand–receptor and also
receptor–promoter interactions. Here, we assessed the role of AhR during RA-induced differentiation and a
hypothesized convergence at Oct4, a transcription factor believed to maintain stem cell characteristics. RA
upregulated AhR and downregulated Oct4 during differentiation of HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. AhR
overexpression in stable transfectants downregulated Oct4 and also decreased ALDH1 activity, another stem
cell–associated factor, enhancing RA-induced differentiation as indicated by cell differentiation markers
associated with early (CD38 and CD11b) and late (neutrophilic respiratory burst) responses. AhR overexpression
also increased levels of activated Raf1, which is known to help propel RA-induced differentiation. RNA
interference-mediated knockdown of Oct4 enhanced RA-induced differentiation and G0 cell-cycle arrest relative
to parental cells. Consistent with the hypothesized importance of Oct4 downregulation for differentiation,
parental cells rendered resistant to RA by biweekly high RA exposure displayed elevated Oct4 levels that failed to
be downregulated. Together, our results suggested that therapeutic effects of RA-induced leukemia differentiation depend on AhR and its ability to downregulate the stem cell factor Oct4. Cancer Res; 71(6); 2371–80. 2011

Introduction
Because malignant cell transformation is often associated
with a maturational block, mechanisms of overcoming the
differentiation block have engendered therapeutic interest.
Retinoids have been shown to induce differentiation and have
antiproliferative activities against skin, head and neck, breast,
uterine, cervical, and liver cancer, although the most effective
activity is against acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL; refs. 1–3).
Retinoic acid (RA) is known to induce cell differentiation
through RAR/RXR nuclear receptor activation. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is another nuclear receptor with a proposed
role in differentiation. Recently, AhR has been shown to propel

breast cancer (4) and liver cancer (5) cell differentiation. AhR
has been found to be expressed in all tissues analyzed. It is
present in the cytosol and in the nuclei. Two AhR functions are
known, both being ligand dependent. It is a basic helix-loophelix/Per-Arnt-Sim (bHLH-PAS) transcription factor (6) and
also an adaptor in the cullin 4B ubiquitin ligase complex (7). The
transcriptional activity is the most studied, especially in the
regulation of detoxification enzymes such as CYP1A1 (8). The
role in the ubiquitin complex is emerging and has been found to
be important for estrogen receptor a and androgen receptor
degradation (9).
It has been shown that a limited number of transcription
factors are needed to induce the self-renewing pluripotent
stem cell state (10–12). Yamanaka and coworkers proposed
Oct4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-Myc (10), whereas Thomson and
coworkers proposed Oct4, SOX2, NANOG, and Lin28 (11) as
essential factors for inducing the self-renewal stem cell state.
A number of subsequent publications showed that, under
certain conditions, the number could be further reduced to
Oct4, SOX2, NANOG (13), or only Oct4 (14). Thus, Oct4 is the
only currently known essential regulator/inducer of induced
pluripotent stem cells among the Yamanaka/Thomson

factors. As such, Oct4 becomes a prominent candidate as a
regulator of cell differentiation caused by the embryonic
morphogen RA.
There are reasons to suspect that RAR/RXR-, AhR-, and
Oct4-controlled pathways are interrelated. The RAR/RXR and
AhR pathways are known to cross-talk. For example, these
receptors compete for SMRT protein and are upregulated by
the same chemicals (15). In the case of the estrogen receptor
(ER), another nuclear receptor which can also form heterocomplexes with RXR, AhR binds to ER response elements in
target gene promoters (16). AhR can also target ER for
degradation, a manifestation of the AhR cytosolic function
(7). There may ergo also be multiple levels of cross-talk
between AhR and RAR /RXR. Some findings suggest that
cross-talk between the AhR and RA pathways occurs during
cell differentiation. Teratogenic effects such as cleft palate and
hydronephrosis can be induced by retinoids (17) and also by
an AhR agonist, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (18). In
fish, RA and its receptors are required both for AhR transcription and for embryonic development of blood vessels and
bones (19).
We conducted an in silica search for putative response
elements in the Oct4 promoter/enhancer region, using Genomatix software. We have found very close putative response
elements for AhR/ARNT (225 to 249þ) and RAR/RXR (230 to
254þ) in Oct4B 50 sequences and also AhR/ARNT (82 to 106þ)
and RAR/RXR (108 to 132þ) in Oct4A, the form with stem cell–
promoting properties, 50 sequences. There was also another
AhR site in each promoter region and another 4 RXR and
7 RXR sites for Oct4B and Oct4A, respectively. It is indeed
known that the Oct4 promoter contains RA response elements
responsible for Oct4 repression (20), but this might occur in
cooperation with AhR in view of the sequence analysis, as well
as with the coincidence of teratogenic effects driven by
activating the RA or AhR pathways.
The present report shows that RA upregulates AhR
expression and downregulates Oct4 when inducing the
myeloid differentiation of HL-60 human leukemia cells. If
these changes are of functional significance, we expect cells
overexpressing AhR to differentiate faster than the parent
cell line after RA treatment. Similarly, we expect cells
expressing less Oct4 (Oct4 knockdown cells) to differentiate
faster than their parent cell line. We created these stable
transfectants and found that this was the case. AhR overexpression downregulated Oct4 and increased the amount of
activated Raf1, which is known to drive RA-induced differentiation, and differentiation was enhanced. Differentiation
was measured by the CD38 and CD11b cell surface markers
and by the functional differentiation marker, inducible oxidative metabolism, namely, the respiratory burst characteristic of mature myeloid cells. Oct4 siRNA knockdown
enhanced RA-induced differentiation, too. The results suggest that RA-induced differentiation depends on AhR and
the mechanism involves downregulation of Oct4. The HL-60
cell line, a human myeloid (FAB M2) precursor cell capable
of induced myeloid or monocytic differentiation, was used as
an experimental system for RA-induced myeloid differentiation. It is an archetype model for the mechanism of action of

RA that has been highly studied with many specific features
of the RA-induced differentiation process very well defined.
It is also a PML-RARa–negative system still responsive to RA
and therefore it has the potential to highlight pathways
involved in RA-induced differentiation that might be
exploited in cancers other than APL.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and treatments
HL-60 human myeloblastic leukemia cells were grown in
RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated FBS (both
from Invitrogen) and 1 antibiotic/antimycotic (Sigma) in a
5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 C. The cell lines were
derived from the original isolates and were a generous gift of
Dr. Robert Gallagher and maintained in this laboratory. RAresistant cells (RH cells) were created by maintaining the cells
in high-density cultures (above 2  106 cells/mL) and treating
them with 9 mmol/L RA once every 2 weeks. For treatments,
all-trans-RA; Sigma) was added from a 0.5 mmol/L stock
solution in ethanol with a final concentration of 1 mmol/L
in culture. Valproic acid (VPA) was added to a final concentration of 1 mmol/L. The VPA treatment was 4 hours before
the RA treatment, and all the times of indicated endpoints are
with respect to RA treatment as the start. Experimental
cultures were initiated at a density of 0.1  106 cells/mL.
The RH cells were kept at normal density and no RA for a week
before the experiments. Viability was monitored by 0.2%
trypan blue (Invitrogen) exclusion and routinely exceeded
95%. All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise mentioned.
Ectopic expression
The AhR overexpressor in pCMV6-XL4 vector was obtained
from OriGene. The Oct4 siRNA in U6.1/Neo was purchased
from GenScript. For transfection in HL-60, 50-mg plasmid and
50-mL Lipofectamine 2000CD (Invitrogen) were incubated in
450 mL serum-free RPMI on ice for 15 minutes and then used
to resuspend 10  106 cells and electroporated immediately at
300 mV.
CD38, CD11b quantification
Expression of cell surface differentiation markers was
quantified by flow cytometry. A total of 0.5  106 cells were
collected from cultures and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm in a
microfuge for 5 minutes. Cell pellets were resuspended in
200 mL 37 C PBS containing 2.5 mL of antibody, APC, or PEconjugated CD11b or CD38, as indicated in the Results section
(all from BD Biosciences). Following 1-hour incubation at
37 C, cell surface expression levels were analyzed by flow
cytometry (BD LSRII flow cytometer; BD Biosciences). APC
fluorescence is excited at 633 nm and collected with a 660/20
band-pass filter. PE fluorescence is excited at 488 nm and
collected with a 576/26 band-pass filter. Undifferentiated
control cells were used to determine the fluorescence intensity
of cells negative for the respective surface antigen. The gate to
determine percent increase of expression was set to exclude
95% of the control population.

AhR Downregulates Oct4

Respiratory burst quantification
Respiratory burst, a functional differentiation marker, was
measured by flow cytometry. A total of 1  106 cells were
collected and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 minutes in a
microfuge. Cell pellets were resuspended in 500 mL at 37 C PBS
containing 5 mmol/L 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-20 ,70 -dichlorodihydro–fluorescein diacetate acetyl ester (H2-DCF; Molecular
Probes) and 0.2 mg/mL 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate
(TPA; Sigma). Both, H2-DCF and TPA stock solutions were
made in DMSO at concentrations of 0.2 mg/mL and 5 mmol/L,
respectively. A control group incubated in H2-DCF and DMSO
only was included. Cells were incubated for 20 minutes at 37 C
prior to analysis by flow cytometry (BD LSRII). Oxidized DCF
was excited by a 488-nm laser and emission collected with a
530/30 nm band-pass filter. The shift in fluorescence intensity
in response to TPA was used to determine the percentage of
cells capable of inducible oxidative metabolism (21). Gates to
determine percent positive cells were set to exclude 95% of
control cells not stimulated with TPA.
Cell-cycle quantification
A total of 1  106 cells were collected by centrifugation and
resuspended in 200 mL of cold propidium iodide (PI) hypotonic staining solution containing 50 mg/mL propidium
iodine, 1 mL/mL Triton X-100, and 1 mg/mL sodium citrate.
Cells were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour and
analyzed by flow cytometry (BD LSRII), using 488-nm excitation and emission collected with a 576/26 band-pass filter.
Doublets were identified by a PI signal width versus area plot
and excluded from the analysis (21, 22).
Nuclear Oct4 quantification
At total of 1  106 cells were collected from cultures and
centrifuged at 1,000 rpm in a microfuge for 5 minutes,
resuspended in 200 mL of cold PI hypotonic solution as
previously described for nuclei isolation (23), incubated on
ice for 15 minutes, centrifuged again at 1,000 rpm for 5 minutes, fixed by resuspension in 100 mL of PBS with 2% paraformaldehyde (PFM; Alfa Aesar), and incubated at room
temperature for 10 minutes followed by addition of 900 mL
of ice-cold methanol to obtain a 90% methanol solution.
Following incubation for 1 hour at 20 C samples were
washed 2 times in hypotonic solution and resuspended in
200 mL PI hypotonic solution containing 2.5 mL of Oct4 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) primary antibody. Following a 4 C overnight incubation period, nuclei were washed once with 1 mL
PI hypotonic solution and stained with secondary AlexaFluor
350 goat anti-rabbit antibody for 1 hour and then analyzed by
flow cytometry (BD LSRII) after 1 wash in PBS. Excitation was
at 325 nm and emission was collected with a 440/40 band-pass
filter. Nuclei unstained with the primary antibody but incubated with the secondary antibody were used to generate the
background signal. Logic gates were set to include all the
nuclei, and the results are given as the percentage of the mean
fluorescence intensity of untreated nuclei.
Aldehyde dehydrogenase enzymatic activity assay
ALDH1 enzymatic activity was measured using the Aldefluor kit (Stem Cell Technologies) as described by Ginestier

www.aacrjournals.org

and coworkers (24), with the modification that the cells were
incubated with the substrate at 37 C for 50 minutes instead of
40 minutes.
Protein detection by Western blotting
A total of 2  107 cells were lysed for total lysate, using
200-mL lysis buffer (Pierce) and lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4 C after 3 cycles of
freeze-thaw. For detection of nuclear proteins, 100 mL hypotonic lysis buffer was used to obtain the nuclei, which were then
lysed in RIPA buffer (Sigma) as previously described (23). For
AhR detection, 25 mg protein (total and nuclear lysates) was
resolved on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. The same amount of
protein was used on 12% gels for the other proteins. The
electrotransfer was for 1 hour at 300 mA. The membranes were
incubated with the indicated primary antibody at 4 C overnight. Anti-AhR antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
All the others were from Cell Signaling. Horseradish peroxidase–linked anti-mouse [for extracellular signal regulated
kinase (ERK) 1/2] or anti-rabbit (for all others) IgG secondary
antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) and ECL (GE Healthcare) were used for detection. All blots were repeated 3 times.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were done using SYSTAT 8.0 software.
Means of treatment groups of interest were compared using
the paired sample t test. All treatment groups were compared
with control cells at the same time point. The data represent
the means of 3 repeats  SEM. A P value of <0.05 was
considered significant.

Results
RA-induced differentiation correlates with increased
AhR levels and decreased Oct4 nuclear levels
RA treatment of HL-60 cells induces expression of a series of
phenotypic markers consistent with induced differentiation.
CD38 receptor expression can be detected within 6 hours of
treatment, and 100% of the cells express it within 24 hours.
CD38 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein, expressed on
several leukocytes and early hematopoietic precursor cells
(25), that can signal through Raf and ERK activation (26).
Expression of CD11b, an integrin receptor subunit that is also
a marker for myeloid differentiation, occurs with slower
kinetics than CD38 post–RA treatment. After expression of
these markers, G0 cell-cycle arrest becomes apparent by
approximately 72 hours of RA treatment. Similarly, inducible
oxidative metabolism, a functional marker that is the antimicrobial respiratory burst of neutrophils, also finally
becomes apparent (Fig. 1A). As RA induces this phenotypic
conversion, AhR expression is upregulated without nuclear
translocation (Fig. 1B) and nuclear Oct4 protein abundance is
downregulated (Fig. 1C). The upper band on the AhR detected
on the 7.5% gel may reflect phosphorylation-induced gel
mobility retardation, as AhR is well known to be phosphorylated upon activation (27). In contrast to Oct4, Oct1 is not
downregulated (Fig. 1D). We have previously shown that BLR1
receptor expression is essential for RA-induced differentiation

Figure 2. AhR upregulation correlates with propelled differentiation and decreased nuclear Oct4 levels. AhR overexpressors treated with RA present
CD38 (6 hours; P < 0.005; A), CD11b (72 hours P ¼ 0.012; B), and respiratory burst (72 hours P ¼ 0.02; C) faster than WT cells treated with RA. Flow

toward neutrophils and that BLR1 expression depends on the
transcriptional activity of Oct1 (28). Although Oct1 and Oct4
have structural and functional similarities, only Oct4 confers
pluripotency (29), consistent with their differential regulation
observed here. As expected for differentiating cells (24, 30),
and consistent with previous reports showing that RA downregulates ALDH (31), we found that ALDH1 enzymatic activity
is downregulated by 1 mmol/L RA treatment, assessed 48
hours posttreatment as cells undergo differentiation
(Fig. 1E). In sum, RA-induced phenotypic conversion to a
differentiated cell is associated with AhR upregulation and
Oct4, but not Oct1, downregulation.

AhR upregulation enhances RA-induced differentiation,
increases Raf pS621 phosphorylation, and decreases
levels of nuclear Oct4
To determine whether RA-induced AhR expression
has functional significance for differentiation, AhR-stable
transfectants were created. Overexpression of AhR in stable
transfectants enhances RA-induced differentiation. There is a
significant increase of RA-induced CD38 and CD11b expression compared with parental cells (Fig. 2A and B). Inducible
oxidative metabolism, the respiratory burst functional differentiation marker, is also enhanced (Fig. 2C). AhR expression
by itself decreases nuclear Oct4 protein levels (Fig. 2D).

Figure 3. AhR upregulation leads to increased Raf pS621 phosphorylation and decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Cell lysates collected 48 hours after RA
treatment (52 hours after VPA treatment) were resolved on 7.5% gel for AhR detection and 12% gel for all the other proteins. Twenty-five micrograms of protein
were loaded per well. For treatment, RA final concentration was 1 mmol/L and VPA was 1 mmol/L. A, AhR protein levels and pS621 Raf are increased in
overexpressors untreated and in RA- and/or VPA-treated cells. B, AhR protein is upregulated and posttranscriptionally modified by RA treatment as shown
72 hours posttreatment by Western blotting. AhR seems to largely reside in the cytosol. C, VPA antagonizes ERK phosphorylation. C, control; V, valproic acid.

Consistent with our hypothesis that AhR upregulation propels
differentiation, ALDH1 activity is downregulated (P ¼ 0.0079)
in AhR overexpressors compared with wild-type (WT) cells
(Fig. 2E). Figure 3A shows a Western blot confirming the
overexpression of AhR in the AhR-stable transfectants
[control WT HL-60 vs. control AhR-transfected HL-60]. AhR
is well known to be phosphorylated upon activation (27), and
resolution of the protein on a 7.5% gel shows phosphorylationinduced gel retardation consistent with this. AhR protein in
AhR overexpressors, as in WT cells, did not translocate to the
nucleus (Fig. 3B). AhR has a known cytosolic function acting
as a ligand-dependent adaptor in the cullin 4B ubiquitin ligase,
whereby it has been found to decrease ER expression and
might decrease nuclear Oct4 levels in a similar way (7).
RA-induces mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling which is necessary to propel differentiation (32, 33). The
MAPK signaling utilizes Raf, activation of which is necessary
to induce terminal myeloid differentiation (34). One might
anticipate from the present results that AhR expression
resulting in enhanced RA-induced CD38 expression would
also result in enhanced Raf activation betrayed by S621
phosphorylation. Western blot analysis confirms that the
AhR-transfected cells had enhanced Raf activation (Fig. 3A,
control wt HL-60 vs. control AhR-transfected HL-60). Surprisingly, enhanced Raf activation due to AhR overexpression does
not result in increased ERK phosphorylation compared with
basal levels in parental WT controls. RA treatment has been
found to cause phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (32, 33), which is
confirmed here (Fig. 3C). But AhR overexpression suppresses
that, suggesting a potential negative regulatory relationship
between AhR and ERK. Interestingly, the reverse has been
reported by Chen and coworkers (35), who showed that upon
ERK kinase inhibition, AhR protein level accumulates. The
results thus show that AhR expression enhances Raf activa-

tion, which is consistent with previously reported results on
Raf propulsion of differentiation (34). They also suggest the
conjecture that Raf can do this independent of activating ERK,
possibly reflecting Raf functions other than activation of MEK
(MAP/ERK kinase)/ERK such as its nuclear translocation (23)
and association with nuclear proteins such as Rb (36), which is
a target downregulated by RA (37, 38)
VPA, an HDAC inhibitor, is known to induce expression of
cytochrome family members that are transcriptionally upregulated by AhR (39). One might thus anticipate that VPA could
cause AhR expression and enhance RA-induced differentiation. Figure 3A confirms AhR upregulation by VPA, alone or in
combination with RA. VPA causes enhanced Raf activation
(Fig. 3A). However, as for AhR overexpression, VPA suppresses
ERK activation in the absence or the presence of RA, although
total ERK protein is upregulated (Fig. 3C). VPA thus causes
AhR overexpression with corresponding signaling effects previously found associated with AhR upregulation.
The ability of VPA to upregulate AhR-motivated testing its
effects on differentiation. VPA treatment induced the expression of the CD11b cell surface differentiation marker early after
treatment (24 hours). RA-induced CD11b expression was also
enhanced by cotreatment with VPA at 24 hours after treatment
(Fig. 4A). VPA also caused downregulation of nuclear Oct4
expression (Fig. 4B and C). RA, AhR, and VPA thus all cause
downregulation of Oct4, motivating the conjecture that Oct4
downregulation facilitates differentiation. Interestingly, all
conditions achieved a similar amount of Oct4 downregulation,
possibly reflecting tight control of Oct4 expression.
Decreased levels of nuclear Oct4 propel RA-induced
differentiation
RA and increased AhR expression caused Oct4 downregulation. To determine whether Oct4 downregulation is functionally

cells was carried out setting the logical gate to exclude 95% of the
untreated cells. VPA by itself blunts Oct4 expression at a level comparable
with RA-downregulated Oct4 levels (as shown 48 hours posttreatment),

significant and facilitates RA-induced differentiation, Oct4
siRNA knockdown stable transfectants were created. The
decreased nuclear Oct4 in stable transfectants is confirmed
by flow cytometry (Fig. 5A) with a P value of 0.013. The knockdown achieved was comparable with the RA-induced reduction
in expression. Although the Oct4 knockdown by itself does not
precipitate differentiation, as evidenced by lack of CD38 or
inducible respiratory burst, it does significantly (P < 0.05)

www.aacrjournals.org

enhance RA-induced CD38 expression, inducible oxidative
metabolism (Fig. 5B and C), and increase in the percentage
of cells in G1/0 (P ¼ 0.015; Fig. 5D). It is noteworthy that the
siRNA knockdown was demonstrable and statistically significant, but was modest; hence, even a relatively small apparent
reduction in Oct4 can have demonstrable effects on facilitating
RA-induced differentiation.
RA-resistant cells have increased levels of nuclear Oct4
after RA treatment
If Oct4 is essential for maintaining cellular stem-like properties—such as self-renewal and immature phenotype—and
decreasing Oct4 levels facilitate RA-induced differentiation,
then the failure of RA-resistant cells to differentiate may be
associated with a failure to decrease expression of nuclear Oct4
after RA treatment. An RA-resistant derivative of the parental
cells was created by subjecting cells maintained at high density
to repeated high doses of RA. The resulting resistant cells
grown from such treatment had lower levels of AhR that failed
to be up regulated by RA (Fig. 6A). Although the RA-resistant
cells have higher basal expression levels of CD38 before RA
treatment than WT cells, RA treatment failed to increase
expression levels of CD38 (Fig. 6B). RA-induced CD11b expression was also blocked in the resistant cells (Fig. 6C). Consistent
with this, there is no RA-induced G0 block, and the G1/0, S, and
G2 distribution is unaffected by RA treatment (Fig. 6D). The
resistant cells had higher basal levels of Oct4 (P ¼ 0.0043;
Fig. 6E) and treated with RA failed to downregulate Oct4 levels.
The significantly higher nuclear Oct4 levels in RA-resistant cells
than in WT cells are consistent with the hypothesis that Oct4
downregulation promotes cell differentiation.

Discussion
The present studies show that when RA induces myeloid
differentiation of lineage uncommitted human myelomonocytic leukemia cells, HL-60, it causes upregulation of AhR and
downregulation of nuclear Oct4. The functional significance of
this was tested. Ectopic overexpression of AhR enhanced Raf
activation, known to propel differentiation; downregulated
Oct4, suggesting a downstream function of Oct4; and
enhanced RA-induced differentiation indexed by cell surface
markers and functional differentiation. Furthermore, VPA
induced AhR upregulation and also enhanced RA-induced
differentiation. Downregulation of Oct4 in siRNA stable transfectants also enhanced RA-induced differentiation, confirming
the anticipated downstream role of Oct4 downregulation in
facilitating differentiation. Interestingly, the modulation of
AhR and Oct4 expression levels to have these effects apparently does not have to be large. Consistent with a suggested
role for Oct4 downregulation in differentiation, RA-resistant
HL-60 cells created by high-dose RA treatment had elevated
Oct4 levels that did not downregulate. In sum, we have found
that RA induces AhR upregulation and Oct4 downregulation,
where AhR expression negatively regulates Oct4, and both
occurrences promote RA-induced differentiation.
The finding that AhR overexpression and knockdown of
Oct4 expression enhanced the induction of differentiation by

Figure 5. Oct4 is instrumental in propelling differentiation. A, confirms Oct4 downregulation in Oct4 knockdown cells. The results of flow cytometric
analysis of PFM-fixed cells are expressed as mean fluorescence of the entire population. B, six hours after RA treatment a significantly greater number
of cells (P < 0.05) expressed CD38. C, oxidative metabolism is enhanced in Oct4 knockdowns (P ¼ 0.03). Flow cytometric assay of live cells was carried out
setting the logical gate to exclude 95% of the untreated cells (B and C). D, Oct4 downregulation increases the percentage of cells in G0 with no
treatment [P ¼ 0.01 (c vs. d)] or with RA treatment [P ¼ 0.015 (a vs. b)] at 48 hours. In RA-treated cells, S is significantly lower in Oct4 knockdowns
(flow cytometry of PI-labeled nuclei). C, control a,b,c,d, and *, statistically significant differences at the indicated P-values.

RA is novel but consistent with other findings. Oct4 is known
to support dedifferentiated stem cells (14, 29). RA, which
induces differentiation, was reported to repress Oct4 protein
expression (40), and we show here that AhR is involved in Oct4
downregulation by RA. RAR, RXR, AhR, and ER are members of
nuclear receptor family of transcription factors binding as
heterodimers and known for their cross-talk (7, 9, 15). In the
case of AhR and ER, it has been shown that AhR can bind to ER
response elements and augment ER responses (41). In HL-60
cells, estradiol at low doses stimulates proliferation and at
high doses inhibits proliferation, similar to the dose–response
effects of RA, suggesting the possibility of cross-talk between
estrodiol and RA (42). Furthermore, estradiol/ER signaling has
been found to enhance RA-induced HL-60 cell differentiation
(43). Cross-talk between estrogen and RA has also been shown
at the nuclear level, where for instance overlapping of ERE and
RARE occurs as for the lactoferrin gene (44). ER could potentially thus be involved in relating AhR and RAR signaling and
cross-talk. In the case of the Oct4A promoter, the AhR and
RAR response elements are very close; hence, multiple ways of
cross-talk could be possible, for example, by cooperation in
protein–DNA binding, in recruiting cofactors, and inducing
chromatin changes responsible for modulation of Oct4 gene
expression. There are thus a number of reasons to anticipate

2378

Cancer Res; 71(6) March 15, 2011

that RAR, AhR, and Oct4 might be interrelated and that
anticipation is borne out in the currently reported findings.
It has also been shown that AhR participates in ER and AR
degradation by functioning as a ligand-dependent substraterecognizing component of an ubiquitin ligase complex (7).
Although it is beyond the scope of our present study to
elucidate the mechanism of Oct4 downregulation by AhR,
the fact that AhR was reported to downregulate other protein
levels supports our report.
We found that AhR expression and its possible phosphorylation drive up Raf pS621 levels. Raf as part of the Raf/MEK/
ERK MAPK signaling module has been found to be needed in
RA-induced differentiation (34). ERK activation has been
found with RA-induced differentiation. But the role of Raf,
although important, is not fully mechanistically defined. We
have previously shown that Raf pS621 accumulates in the
nuclei during RA-induced differentiation and others have
shown that AhR phosphorylation increases its nuclear activity.
The fact that VPA increases Raf pS612 levels but inhibits
occurrence of ERKpTEpY and that AhR overexpression due to
ectopic expression also blunts RA-induced ERK activation
suggests that ERK activation is not absolutely necessary. Of
relevance, ERK has been found to be capable of acting as a
scaffold to facilitate signaling without actual activation (45).

Figure 6. RA-resistant cells had low levels of AhR and RA treatment did not upregulate AhR (A), did not change the CD38 at 24 hours (B) and CD11b at
72 hours (C) levels, nor the cell-cycle phase distribution (D), and present higher nuclear Oct4 basal levels than WT cells (E; flow cytometry). C, control a,b,

The cumulative evidence points to the importance of Raf
activation in contributing propulsion to RA-induced differentiation.
The current statistics associated with APL continue to show
a relatively high recurrence rate together with a poor survival
despite a very high rate of remission after the standard RAinduced differentiation therapy. The results presented here
are of potential clinical significance. They show that in the
standard RA-induced differentiation induction therapy the
downregulation of stem cell–promoting factor, Oct4, is important in overcoming the maturation block and that this process
is AhR dependent. Furthermore, VPA can promote aspects of
this process.
