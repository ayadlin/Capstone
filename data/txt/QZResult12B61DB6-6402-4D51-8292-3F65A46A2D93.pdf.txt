Androgen Receptor on the Move: Boarding the Microtubule
Expressway to the Nucleus

Abstract
Recent studies have shown that the microtubule-stabilizing drug paclitaxel, which is commonly used for the
treatment of prostate cancer, inhibits signaling from the androgen receptor by inhibiting its nuclear accumulation
downstream of microtubule stabilization. This mechanism is independent of paclitaxel-induced mitotic arrest
and could provide an alternative mechanism of drug action that can explain its clinical activity. In this review, we
highlight the importance of signaling and trafﬁcking pathways that depend on intact and dynamic microtubules,
and, as such, they represent downstream targets of microtubule inhibitors. We showcase prostate cancer, which is
driven by the activity of the androgen receptor, as recent reports have revealed a connection between the
microtubule-dependent trafﬁcking of the androgen receptor and the clinical efﬁcacy of taxanes. Identiﬁcation
and further elucidation of microtubule-dependent tumor-speciﬁc pathways will help us better understand the
molecular basis of clinical taxane resistance as well as to identify individual patients more likely to respond to
treatment. Cancer Res; 72(18); 4611–5. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
In 2012, prostate cancer will be diagnosed in more than
240,000 men, with approximately 28,000 deaths attributable to
prostate cancer (1). Prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease,
driven primarily by androgen receptor (AR) signaling, and has
been traditionally treated with androgen deprivation therapy
(ADT). Although our understanding of the molecular basis of
prostate cancer has signiﬁcantly increased over the past
decade, for men who develop metastases, the principle of ADT
is essentially the same as it was ﬁrst proposed 60 years ago: to
interfere with androgen signaling (2). The goal of ADT is to
block active AR signaling, either by eliminating the ligand or
affecting the receptor directly. Although most patients with
prostate cancer are initially sensitive to androgen withdrawal,
loss of sensitivity to ADT occurs, leading to the development of
castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC; ref. 3). Similarly, even
with the introduction of new and more effective therapies that
target the androgen axis, such as the CYP17A1 inhibitor
abiraterone, which targets the central synthesis of testosterone, and the AR antagonist MDV3100, ADT is not curative (3).
The molecular disturbances that contribute to prostate cancer
progression in the setting of castrate levels of circulating
androgen have been reviewed elsewhere (4–7), but almost
universally allow for the continued function of the AR as a

transcription factor, resulting in androgen-driven prostate
cancer growth. Consequently, targeting the androgen axis has
remained a key concept in the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
In 2004, the combination of docetaxel plus prednisone was
established as the standard of care for ﬁrst-line treatment of
patients with CRPC, making taxanes the ﬁrst class of chemotherapy drugs shown to improve survival in CRPC (8, 9). At the
cellular level, the taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel, and cabazitaxel) bind b-tubulin and stabilize microtubules, resulting in
mitotic arrest and cell death (10, 11). Microtubules are dynamic
cytoskeletal polymers critically important for several cellular
functions, including structural support and the formation of
the mitotic apparatus. During cell division, microtubule
dynamics increase signiﬁcantly (4–100 fold) to enable fast
"search and chromosome capture" functions required for
mitosis (10). Therefore, drugs that stabilize microtubules, like
the taxanes, interfere with mitotic cell progression by suppressing microtubule dynamics. This key observation, supported by
numerous in vitro studies, has led to the common belief that the
clinical activity of taxanes stems from their antimitotic activity
(12). However, this mechanism of action has not helped us
understand the molecular basis of clinical response and resistance to taxane chemotherapy, as this model applies primarily
to rapidly dividing cells and tissues. It is important to emphasize here that patients' tumors have signiﬁcantly lower rates of
cell division than cancer cells growing in vitro. For example,
prostate cancer doubles every 33 to 577 days (13, 14), in
contrast to the rapidly dividing prostate cancer cells grown
in tissue culture with doubling times between 30 to 48 hours
(15, 16); therefore, mitotic arrest alone cannot account for the
therapeutic beneﬁt of taxane-based chemotherapy (17, 18).
Thus, the effects of taxanes on interphase microtubules and the
cellular pathways that depend directly on intact microtubules

could provide an alternate mechanism of action for this class of
drugs. Although this notion challenges the existing paradigm of
taxanes exerting their clinical activity exclusively through
inhibition of mitosis, by shifting the focus to interphase
microtubules, it provides a unique opportunity to dissect
how these drugs work and why they are not effective in all
tumor types and all patients. The question is then raised of
what are the functions of interphase microtubules that are
critical for the growth and survival of the tumor?

Interphase Microtubules as Targets for Taxane
Chemotherapy
In interphase cells, microtubules cover the entire area of the
cell's cytoplasm, originating from the microtubule-organizing
center (MTOC), right outside the nucleus, and extending all
the way to the plasma membrane, providing ample surface for
protein–protein interactions. In epithelial cells, microtubules
display an inherent polarity, having their slow-growing minus
end embedded in the MTOC and their fast-growing plus end
oriented toward the plasma membrane. This polarity is used by
microtubule-based motor proteins, moving cargoes either
toward the nucleus (dynein) or toward the plasma membrane
(kinesins), thereby allowing for the directional ﬂow of signal
information within the cell, which ultimately dictates cell
function (19–21). All of these qualities make microtubules
centralized nodes of dynamic signaling pathways (22), which
remain largely unexplored and their therapeutic potential
unexploited.
We have focused our efforts into identifying pathways that
depend on intact and dynamic microtubules, disruption of
which by taxane treatment would be fatal for tumor cell
survival. We have shown that the activity of certain transcription factors depends on the chemomechanics of the microtubule cytoskeleton and, therefore, these factors represent
downstream targets of taxane activity. These factors include
the tumor suppressor p53, which requires intact microtubules
and the dynein minus-end–directed motor protein for trafﬁcking and effective nuclear accumulation (23, 24), and the
hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a), of which the activity is
tightly regulated by microtubule dynamics through microtubule-dependent mRNA trafﬁcking to sites of active protein
translation (25, 26). Interestingly, this mechanism does not
apply to renal cell carcinoma (RCC), in which HIF-1a regulation
is independent of microtubules (27). These results can potentially explain the lack of taxane clinical activity in RCC;
identiﬁcation of the cellular factors that link HIF-1a to microtubules that are missing or are deregulated in RCC can provide a
new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of this lethal disease.
Additional proteins of which the translocation is microtubule mediated are the retinoblastoma protein (28), the glucocorticoid receptor (29), and the parathyroid hormone receptor
protein (PTHrP; ref. 30). Komlodi-Pasztor and colleagues
provide a detailed list of other proteins that trafﬁc on or
associate with microtubules (14).
In prostate cancer, speciﬁcally, we and others have recently
shown that taxane chemotherapy impairs AR signaling activity,
not through mitosis, but by impairing AR nuclear translocation

4612

Cancer Res; 72(18) September 15, 2012

and inhibiting subsequent transcriptional activation of androgen response element (ARE)–containing target genes (31, 32).
Other recent studies showed that paclitaxel-induced inhibition
of AR activity is mediated by FOXO1, an AR-suppressive
nuclear transcription factor (33), and that docetaxel treatment
can downregulate the expression of AR and prostate-speciﬁc
antigen in prostate cancer cell lines (34).
Prompted by the established clinical activity of taxanes in
CRPC, together with the fact that AR continues to drive disease
progression despite prior antiandrogen therapies (35), we set
out to investigate the role of tubulin and the impact of
microtubule-targeting drugs on AR trafﬁcking and signaling.
The results presented in our recent study (31) provide a
mechanistic insight for the clinical activity of taxanes in CRPC
by revealing an unconventional link between a nuclear transcription factor and the chemomechanics of the microtubule
cytoskeleton. As illustrated in Fig. 1, AR associates with microtubules and is trafﬁcked toward the nucleus with the aid of the
minus-end–directed motor protein dynein. It is well established that upon ligand binding, AR dimerizes and the ligand–
receptor complex translocates to the nucleus (36). However,
the mechanism enabling this translocation was previously
unknown. The recent studies (31, 32) identify microtubules
as the "highway tracks" that enable the rapid and targeted
nuclear "delivery" of AR, which is required for its transcriptional activity. What remains to be solved, however, is whether
AR binds microtubules directly, remaining tethered in the
cytoplasm and associating with dynein only after ligand binding, or whether AR associates with dynein in the cytoplasm
and, following ligand binding, the ligand–receptor complex
gets recruited to the microtubule for trafﬁcking. Recent data
from our laboratory support the ﬁrst model, as we show that
AR association with microtubules is diminished in the presence of ligand (Fig. 2) and that the coprecipitation of AR with
dynein is enhanced following ligand stimulation (30). These
results suggest that unliganded AR, at steady state, is tethered
to the microtubule cytoskeleton and that, upon ligand binding,
the complex associates with dynein and is released from the
microtubule. In vitro studies using recombinant AR protein
and puriﬁed microtubules are required to further investigate
AR-binding afﬁnity to microtubules. Regardless of direct or
indirect binding of AR to the microtubule, dynein's function is
critical for the trafﬁcking not only of AR but also other proteins
for which nuclear localization is critical to their respective
physiologic roles, such as p53 (23), retinoblastoma protein (28),
and PTHrP (30). With the implication of dynein in this mechanism, it has also become important to decipher the role of the
dynein accessory proteins that mediate cargo recognition
speciﬁc for AR. This information will enable the development
of dynein small-molecule inhibitors, which in combination
with taxane chemotherapy, could prove signiﬁcantly beneﬁcial
to patients with CRPC.

Using the Microtubule–AR Axis to Understand
Clinical Taxane Resistance in Prostate Cancer
The model presented in Fig. 1 provides a basis for understanding clinical taxane resistance in prostate cancer.

Androgen Receptor Activity Depends on Intact Microtubules

Figure 1. Proposed model of taxane mechanism of action in prostate cancer. This model represents a novel mechanism of action for taxanes in prostate
cancer, which implicates this class of drugs in critical interphase cellular functions such as AR intracellular transport and signaling. In the model, AR associates
with microtubules and translocates to the nucleus via the motor protein dynein. This transport is made possible because of the inherent polarity of
microtubules, which is recognized by the minus-end–directed motor protein dynein, to transport cargoes toward the nucleus. Taxanes, which bind to and
hyperstabilize microtubules, inhibit this trafﬁcking and subsequently prevent AR from reaching the nucleus and activating target genes. This mechanism of
action predicts that the combination of a taxane with an inhibitor of AR ligand synthesis (i.e., abiraterone) or with inhibitors of AR–ligand interaction
(i.e., MDV3100) would be synergistic in the clinical setting, as there will be inhibition of the AR signaling axis by 2 different but converging pathways.
Additionally, the model predicts that a small-molecule inhibitor of dynein would similarly impair AR nuclear accumulation and would also be synergistic in
combination with a taxane. Finally, the model suggests that a putative small-molecule inhibitor targeting the interaction between AR and microtubules
or dynein could be used therapeutically for CRPC treatment.

Darshan and colleagues (31) showed that perturbation of the
microtubule–AR axis is an important determinant of taxane
activity, independent of mitosis, as AR cytoplasmic sequestration in circulating tumor cells isolated from patients with

Figure 2. Ligand treatment decreases the association of AR with
microtubules. A microtubule cosedimentation assay using whole-cell
lysate from PC3:mCh-tub cells transfected with GFP–AR[(wild-type (wt)]
was carried out in the presence or absence of the synthetic
dihydrotestosterone analogue (R1881, 10 nmol/L). Brieﬂy, a total of 1 mg of
precleared cell extract [high-speed supernatant (HSS)] from the
transfected cells was incubated for 30 min with 10 mmol/L exogenous
puriﬁed bovine brain tubulin and subjected to a cycle of polymerization with
20 mmol/L paclitaxel at 37 C. The samples were centrifuged at 100,000g to
separate the microtubule polymers [warm pellet (WP)] from the soluble
tubulin dimers [warm supernatant (WS)], resolved by SDS-PAGE and
immunoblotted for the presence of AR and tubulin. Note that R1881
treatment decreases the amount of AR protein that cosediments with the
microtubule polymer, as can be seen by the shift from 85% to 44% of AR in
the WP [%P ¼ 100 WP/(WPþWS)]. Protein quantiﬁcation was done using
ImageJ (NIH) software. Tubulin was detected as microtubule polymers in
the WP fraction in both conditions. HSP, high-speed pellet.

CRPC signiﬁcantly correlated with clinical response to taxane
chemotherapy.
Taxanes bind b-tubulin, suppress microtubule dynamics,
and hyperstabilize the microtubule cytoskeleton by inducing
the formation of microtubule bundles, a hallmark of effective
drug-target engagement. Microtubule bundling is the ﬁrst
cellular insult that leads to disruption of downstream pathways. This mechanism implies that taxane chemotherapy
should be most effective against tumor types in which microtubule-dependent pathways drive tumor progression, like the
AR pathway in prostate cancer.
Despite the success of taxanes in CRPC treatment, their
efﬁcacy varies from patient to patient, whereas it remains
unclear why individual patients respond to paclitaxel but not
docetaxel and vice versa, even though these drugs share the
same mechanism of action and a common binding site on
b-tubulin. In 2010, the docetaxel analogue cabazitaxel was
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the
treatment of patients with CRPC who previously failed docetaxel-based therapy (37). This approval highlights, once again,
the activity of this class of drugs in CRPC, while raising the
question of ﬁnding what the molecular basis of clinical taxane
resistance is. According to the model presented here, clinical
taxane resistance could arise as a result of the following: (i)
impaired drug uptake, potentially due to the presence of Pglycoprotein or other drug transporters; (ii) impaired binding
to b-tubulin, possibly due to the presence of tubulin mutations
at the drug-binding site or overexpression of bIII tubulin
isotype; (iii) the presence of AR mutations or splice variants
that do not require microtubule-based transport; and (iv)
dysregulation of dynein–cargo interaction.

For the ﬁrst possibility, limited studies have not suggested
a signiﬁcant correlation between P-glycoprotein expression
and response to taxane treatment in patients with prostate
cancer (38). Similarly, tubulin alterations, such as b-tubulin
mutations or altered isotype expression, have not been
associated with response to taxane-based therapy in CRPC
either (39). Conversely, alterations of AR have been extensively studied in CRPC, albeit not in the context of taxane
resistance. Recent studies have shown the presence of
alternatively spliced AR variants, such as ARv567 and ARV7, which arise following castration (40–43). These variants
lack the ligand-binding domain, are insensitive to ADT, and
are constitutively active in the nucleus, which allows for
continuous AR transcriptional activity. The ARv567 variant
was shown to be present in 59% of patients with CRPC and
to arise in response to ADT or to the newer AR-targeted
therapies, such as abiraterone (44). The frequency of this
molecular alteration in CRPC makes it imperative to determine whether these variants are under microtubule control,
similar to wild-type AR, and whether they would respond to
taxane treatment. Our model predicts that any AR variant
lacking the microtubule- or dynein-binding domain would
be insensitive to taxane treatment and, thereby, has the
potential to serve as a predictive biomarker of clinical taxane
activity. Finally, for the dysregulation of dynein–cargo
interaction, our model predicts that any aberration and/or
mutation in the dynein motor protein that impairs cargo
(AR) recognition and/or transport should lead to taxane
resistance.

Therapeutic Implications and Perspectives
The model presented herein suggests that simultaneous
targeting of different pathways that inhibit AR signaling may
result in greater or more durable antitumor effects. Speciﬁcally,
combination of a taxane, which interferes with AR nuclear
translocation, with an inhibitor of androgen synthesis (e.g.,
abiraterone) or an inhibitor of AR–ligand interaction, such as
MDV3100, which also inhibits AR nuclear accumulation (by
yet-to-be deﬁned mechanism; ref. 45), could yield enhanced
therapeutic efﬁcacy. To this end, a phase I trial is currently
testing the combination of docetaxel and abiraterone in
patients with CRPC. More importantly, understanding the
precise mechanisms by which prostate cancer cells circumvent

AR signaling inhibition will allow development of novel, more
targeted therapies. For instance, the development of a smallmolecule inhibitor of dynein, or of the dynein–AR interaction,
could be added to the space of CRPC therapy. Similarly, the
recent identiﬁcation of an N-terminal–targeted AR inhibitor,
which has the potential to target both AR wild-type and
variants as the N-terminal domain is conserved (46, 47), should
be synergistic in combination with a taxane. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms used by a prostate cancer cell to
bypass AR inhibition as well as the cellular factors that regulate
AR signaling in CRPC is required to develop approaches that
will allow men to live with metastatic prostate cancer beyond
the 1 to 2 years typically associated with responses to chemotherapy after ADT.

Summary
In summary, our group's work highlights the importance of
microtubule-dynein–dependent trafﬁcking for transcription
factors, such as AR, that require rapid and targeted nuclear
translocation upon speciﬁc stimuli. In addition, this work
challenges the existing paradigm whereby the clinical activity
of taxanes in prostate cancer is attributed solely to the drugs'
antimitotic effects and it highlights the therapeutic importance of the signaling events that are impaired downstream of
drug-induced microtubule disruption.
