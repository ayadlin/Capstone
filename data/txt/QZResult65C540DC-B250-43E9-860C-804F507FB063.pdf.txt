Abstract
Endocrine treatment regimens for breast cancer that target
the estrogen receptor-a (ERa) are effective, but acquired resistance remains a limiting drawback. One mechanism of
acquired resistance that has been hypothesized is functional
substitution of the orphan receptor estrogen-related receptor-a
(ERRa) for ERa. To examine this hypothesis, we analyzed ERRa
and ERa in recurrent tamoxifen-resistant breast tumors and
conducted a genome-wide target gene proﬁling analysis of
MCF-7 breast cancer cell populations that were sensitive or
resistant to tamoxifen treatment. This analysis uncovered a
global redirection in the target genes controlled by ERa, ERRa,
and their coactivator AIB1, deﬁning a novel set of target genes
in tamoxifen-resistant cells. Beyond differences in the ERa and
ERRa target gene repertoires, both factors were engaged in

similar pathobiologic processes relevant to acquired resistance.
Functional analyses conﬁrmed a requirement for ERRa in
tamoxifen- and fulvestrant-resistant MCF-7 cells, with pharmacologic inhibition of ERRa sufﬁcient to partly restore sensitivity
to antiestrogens. In clinical specimens (n ¼ 1041), increased
expression of ERRa was associated with enhanced proliferation
and aggressive disease parameters, including increased levels of
p53 in ERa-positive cases. In addition, increased ERRa expression was linked to reduced overall survival in independent
tamoxifen-treated patient cohorts. Taken together, our results
suggest that ERa and ERRa cooperate to promote endocrine
resistance, and they provide a rationale for the exploration of
ERRa as a candidate drug target to treat endocrine-resistant
breast cancer. Cancer Res; 75(4); 720–31. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

stimuli classically induced by estrogens (3). Beyond the widespread improvements by these treatment regimens, the frequent
onset of antiestrogen resistance remains a major limitation (4),
underlining the clinical need for alternative drug targets.
A compelling body of evidence suggests involvement of another nuclear hormone receptor, estrogen-related receptor-a (ERRa),
in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. Increased ERRa expression
was found in mammary tumors and correlated with an impaired
disease-free and overall patient survival (5, 6). The pathophysiologic relevance of ERRa has been further demonstrated in vivo, as
ERRa inhibition in xenograft systems reduces breast tumor
growth, and in HER-2/neu–driven breast cancer mouse models,
ERRa knockout delays tumor formation (7, 8). Despite the
structural relationship, ERa and ERRa share only 33% homology
in their ligand-binding domains, resulting in the insensitivity
of ERRa to classical ERa ligands such as estrogen and tamoxifen
(9–11). Because of the lack of known natural ligands, ERRa is
classiﬁed as orphan receptor, whereas its transcriptional activity
can be abrogated by small-molecule inhibitors (i.e., XCT790;
ref. 12).
ERRa and ERa possess a high sequence homology in their
central DNA-binding domains (68%), and therefore each recognize the others cognate-binding motif (9, 13). Identiﬁcation of a
subset of common target genes (e.g., pS2; refs. 14, 15), raised
the hypothesis that ERRa bypasses the requirement for ERa in
endocrine-resistant breast cancers and fuels resistance. This concept has been corroborated by the interplay of ERRa and known
determinants of antiestrogen resistance such as HER-2/neu and
the coactivator AIB1 (6, 8, 16). As a versatile nuclear hormone

The ligand-activated transcription factor ERa is a key driver of
the breast cancer phenotype in around 70% of patients (1).
Accordingly, endocrine treatment modalities targeting ERa, such
as the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) tamoxifen or
downregulator (SERD) fulvestrant (Fulv; SERM) constitute the
basis for therapeutic intervention in ERa-positive tumors (2).
Fulvestrant as a pure ERa antagonist and tamoxifen as partial
antagonist counteract the pro–proliferative and antiapoptotic

receptor regulator, AIB1 not only regulates ERa's transcriptional
activity (17), but likely dictates ERRa activity by functioning as
substitute "protein ligand" (6). However, its inﬂuence on tamoxifen resistance is still controversial.
The substantial cross-talk between ERa and ERRa emphasizes
the need to elucidate their concerted action in endocrine-resistant
breast carcinomas. Beyond recent reports that focused on tamoxifen-induced ERa cistromes (18–20), no comprehensive map of
ERa-, ERRa-, and AIB1-binding events in relation to gene expression had so far been described in the tamoxifen-resistant setting.

ERRa and ERa in Antiestrogen Resistance in Breast Cancer

Thus, we analyzed ERRa, ERa, and AIB1 in recurrent tamoxifenresistant breast cancers and conducted a genome-wide target gene
proﬁling in tamoxifen-resistant and -sensitive MCF-7 cell culture
models. Furthermore, we performed functional analyses of
ERRa's role in treatment sensitivity and assessed its predictive
impact on patient's response toward endocrine therapy.

Materials and Methods
Fresh-frozen, formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded breast cancer
specimens and patient characteristics
Fresh-frozen primary pretreatment (tumor set I) and secondary
locoregional tamoxifen–resistant (tumor set II) breast cancer
specimens were collected between 2001 and 2012 at the University Woman's Hospital Heidelberg (Germany) or obtained from
the PATH tumor bank (Munich, Germany; ref. 21). All patients
from tumor set II received tamoxifen therapy, and the relapse
occurred within the time of or upon completion of treatment. All
patients signed informed consents, and the study was approved by
the Ethical Committee of the Universities of Heidelberg or Bonn,
respectively. Tumor set III, deﬁned as ERaþ (IRS-score 3) has
been described before (22) and comprises like tumor set IV and
the publicly available dataset GSE9893, used for survival analyses,
pretreatment primary tumors. These patients received adjuvant
tamoxifen therapy (22, 23) with a standard duration of 5 years.
The median follow-up time was 58 (tumor set IV) and 65.9
(GSE9893) months. Additional patient characteristics are
described in Supplementary Table S1.
Cell lines
Antiestrogen-sensitive (#Wt) and -resistant (#TamR and
#FulvR) MCF-7 cells were from R.I. Nicholson (Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK) and derived as previously described
(24, 25). Cell line authentication was assessed using short
tandem repeat proﬁling. #Wt cells were routinely grown under
"maintenance" culture conditions in RPMI containing 5%
fetal calf serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin,
2.5 mg/mL fungizone, and 4 mmol/L glutamine. #TamR and
#FulvR cells were cultured in "experimental" medium [phenolred–free RPMI, 5% charcoal-stripped, steroid-depleted fetal calf
serum, antibiotics, fungizone, and glutamine as indicated
above] and supplemented with 100 nmol/L 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT) or fulvestrant. If not other speciﬁed, #Wt cells were
cultured under "experimental" conditions and 4OHT and fulvestrant were withdrawn from #TamR and #FulvR cells
72 hours before experiments.
Western blot analysis, RNA isolation, quantitative real-time
PCR, and microarray gene-expression proﬁling
Western blot analysis, RNA isolation, quantitative real-time
PCR (qRT-PCR), and microarray gene-expression proﬁling (Agilent 4  44 k) were performed as described previously (6), and
outlined in the supplements with antibodies and primers
depicted in Supplementary Tables S2 and S3.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation and ChIP-Seq
Hormone-depleted MCF-7 cells were treated with 4OHT (1
mmol/L) or DMSO for 1 hour. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) was performed using the Transcription-Factor-ChIP-Kit
(Diagenode) with minor modiﬁcations and library preparation
according to the NEBNextChIP-Seq Sample-Prep Master-Mix
Set 1.

www.aacrjournals.org

Enrichment of biologic processes
Network discovery of enriched target genes in #TamR (vs. #Wt)
was computed with Ingenuity Systems IPA (www.ingenuity.com).
Cell viability assays
Cells were treated every 2 days with 4OHT (100 nmol/L),
fulvestrant (100 nmol/L), and XCT790 (1 mmol/L) and viability
was monitored with the CellTiter-96 Aqueous-Non-Radioactive
Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega).
Lentiviral knockdown and Click-iT-Edu cell proliferation
assays
Production of lentiviral particles targeting ERRa (TRCN0000022179 and TRCN0000022181; Sigma-Aldrich) and a nontargeting control shRNA (SHC002) was conducted as described
previously (26). Proliferation was assessed by the Click-iT-EdU
Cell Proliferation Kit (Life Technologies).
Immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays
The tissue microarray (TMA) was comprised of primary formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded (FFPE) breast tumor samples
(tumor set III and IV). Upon ERRa staining (Abcam), data were
analyzed as described before (22).
Kaplan–Meier survival analyses
ERRa mRNA expression values were retrieved from a tamoxifen-treated primary breast cancer gene-expression proﬁling metaset deposited at NCBI-GEO database (GSE9893; ref. 23). ERRa
protein expression was assessed by IHC in tumor set IV.
Statistical analyses and bioinformatic computation
Statistical analyses and bioinformatic computation were performed as outlined in the supplements. P values are listed in
Supplementary Table S4.
Additional information is provided in the Supplementary
Materials and Methods.

Results
ERa and ERRa in recurrent tamoxifen-resistant breast
carcinomas and MCF-7–based breast cancer models of
endocrine resistance
ERa and ERRa mRNA expression was analyzed in a cohort of
19 relapsed breast tumors, which emerged during or after
completion of long-term adjuvant tamoxifen treatment (tumor
set II, Supplementary Table S1). Comparison with primary
treatment-na€ve breast carcinomas (tumor set I) revealed a
minor downregulation of ERa ( , P ¼ 0.0169), although most
tumors remained ERa positive, and slight upregulation of ERRa
( , P ¼ 0.0477) in tamoxifen-resistant cases (Fig. 1A).
To assess the suitability of in vitro model systems for functional
analyses, ERa and ERRa expression was studied in a tamoxifen(#TamR) and a fulvestrant (#FulvR)-resistant MCF-7 subline. In
comparison with the corresponding antiestrogen-sensitive parental strain (#Wt), #TamR and #FulvR cells were characterized by a
slight and complete reduction in ERa expression, respectively,
which is in good agreement with published data (Fig. 1B;
refs. 25, 27), regardless of short-term treatment with the respective
antiestrogens. Furthermore, an increase in ERRa was detected in
the #TamR subline. Hence, the cell lines can be considered as
eligible models to investigate the impact of ERa and ERRa on
endocrine resistance.

In addition, cell proliferation assays conﬁrmed the treatment

increased proliferation rate in the presence of tamoxifen, but a
decrease upon fulvestrant treatment, #FulvR cells displayed crossresistance to both antiestrogens.
In the following, we elucidated whether resistant cells retain
canonical ERa signaling. For this purpose, MCF-7 #Wt, #TamR,

and #FulvR cells were treated with estradiol (E2) or 4OHT, and the
relative mRNA expression of the established ERa target genes pS2,
PgR, and CCND1 (28) was measured using qRT-PCR (Fig. 1C). As
expected, supplementation of the cell culture media with estradiol
resulted in a marked increase in target gene expression in #Wt
cells, a feature not observed upon administration of the partial
antagonist tamoxifen. In contrast, #TamR cells displayed a highly
variable response pattern. Whereas the estradiol-dependent pS2

levels (left) were lower in #TamR cells, estradiol-induced PgR
(middle) was expressed to a similar extent as in the #Wt subline.
Irrespective of the presence of estradiol or tamoxifen, CCND1
(right) exhibited high baseline expression levels in #TamR, but in
accordance with the other target genes was lost in ERa-negative
fulvestrant-resistant MCF-7 cells. These ﬁndings indicate a disengaged target gene regulation in tamoxifen-resistant cells at selected
promoters. Moreover, we delineated the phosphorylation status
of ERa S118 as a classical activation marker in ERa-positive #Wt
and #TamR cells (Fig. 1D). In #Wt cells, phosphorylation was
induced in a ligand-dependent manner, whereas high baseline
levels of phosphorylated ERa S118 were present even in untreated
#TamR cells.
Furthermore, we investigated ERa's ability to induce target gene
expression in refractory tamoxifen-resistant breast tumors (tumor
set II). The progesterone receptor (PR) serves as a reliable surrogate marker to assess ERa functionality in FFPE patient tumor
material (29). Analyses of the complete set (n ¼ 20) of immunohistochemically stained specimens revealed that 76.5% of ERapositive tumors coexpressed PR, whereas the remaining 23.5%
lacked notable PR expression (Table 1). Correspondingly, ERa
retains its capability for canonical downstream signaling in the
majority of tamoxifen-resistant tumors. In combination with the
sensitivity of tamoxifen-resistant cells toward ERa loss (as
assessed by the SERM fulvestrant; Supplementary Fig. S1B), the
modiﬁed ERa activity on selected target genes in vitro and the
slightly increased ERRa expression in tamoxifen-resistant cells
suggest that global adaptions in the target gene regulation of the
nuclear receptors might contribute to endocrine resistance.
Genome-wide landscape of ERa-, ERRa-, and AIB1-binding
sites in tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 cells
To map ERa- and ERRa-binding events in the endocrineresistant setting across the genome, we selected the ERa- and
ERRa-expressing MCF-7 #Wt and #TamR cells and subjected them
to ChIP sequencing (ChIP-Seq) after tamoxifen or vehicle
(DMSO) treatment. In addition, AIB1 was included into the
experimental setup to evaluate its binding pattern in resistant
cells. The ChIP reaction was monitored by the detection of
precipitated protein–DNA complexes using Western blot analysis
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). The ChIP-Seq approach identiﬁed a
vast enrichment of ERa upon tamoxifen treatment on classical
target genes such as TMPRSS3 and GREB1 (18) in #Wt cells,
underlining the robustness of the method (Fig. 2A top, for the
complete panel Supplementary Fig. S2B). Compared with the ERa
frequency distribution, ERRa and AIB1 predominantly showed
lower but broader peaks (Fig. 2B and C top; Supplementary Fig.
S2C–S2D). The ChIP-Seq data were further validated by ChIP–
qRT-PCR conﬁrming the recruitment of all factors to known and
newly identiﬁed cognate-binding elements (ERa: TMPRSS3,
GREB1; ERRa: ESRRA, BMP7; AIB1: E2F4, CELF3; Fig. 2A–C,
bottom; Supplementary Fig. S3).
Different ERa, ERRa, and AIB1 target gene repertoires between
tamoxifen-sensitive and -resistant breast cancer cells
Hierarchical clustering of all ChIP-Seq peaks, occupied by
either ERa, ERRa, or AIB1 under any treatment condition (Fig.
2D), demonstrated clearly binding clusters speciﬁc for MCF-7 #Wt
or #TamR cells. Because binding of a transcription factor not
necessarily implies a biologic outcome on transcriptional level,
gene-expression proﬁling was conducted under the same exper-

imental conditions. Hierarchical clustering of the top differentially regulated transcripts again revealed distinct transcriptional
networks between #Wt and #TamR cells (Fig. 2E; Supplementary
Table S5). These ﬁndings are in accordance with the SAM analyses
(FDR < 0.01), which unraveled a large proportion of signiﬁcantly
upregulated (1,060) and downregulated (1,429) transcripts in
#TamR compared with #Wt cells.
Subsequently, we interrogated the target gene repertoires of
ERa, ERRa, and AIB1 in detail (Fig. 3; Supplementary Table S6)
and dissected the global ERa chromatin occupancy in response to
tamoxifen. Tamoxifen facilitated a rapid recruitment of ERa to
DNA interaction sites in #Wt cells (Fig. 3A, left). Hitherto unexpected was the inverse recruitment pattern in the #TamR subline,
as we observed reduced chromatin binding of the ERa/tamoxifen
complex in comparison with the nonligand-bound receptor (Fig.
3A, right). We further applied consensus-binding motif analyses
to assess whether ERa still executes genomic signaling in tamoxifen-treated #TamR cells. The classical estrogen-response element
(ERE; ref. 18) emerged as the most prevalent ERa DNA interaction
site, approving maintenance of canonical genomic signaling in
tamoxifen-resistant cells (Fig. 3B).
To identify functionally relevant target genes, high-afﬁnity–
binding events were combined and set in relation to expression
changes. Beyond a minor proportion of common ERa target genes
in untreated cells [DMSO: n ¼ 86 (15.4%); Fig. 3C, left] and a
slight upregulation upon tamoxifen administration [4OHT: n ¼
224 (27.5%); Fig. 3C, right], the majority remained unique in #Wt
and #TamR cells. Closer examination of the total number of ERa
target genes in #Wt (DMSO, n ¼ 180; 4OHT, n ¼ 725) and #TamR
(DMSO, 466; 4OHT, 315) sublines further uncovered ligandindependent binding of ERa in tamoxifen-resistant cells in line
with previous data (19).
Substantial differences were also observed for the ERRa and
AIB1 target gene repertoires in tamoxifen-sensitive compared with
-resistant sublines. Only 14.7% of ERRa target genes were commonly regulated in #Wt and #TamR cells (Fig. 3D), whereas a
higher degree of overlap was observed for AIB1 target genes
(26.5%, Fig. 3E). Correspondingly, the majority of targets were
differentially controlled between #Wt (total target genes: ERRa,
n ¼ 221; AIB1, n ¼ 270) and #TamR cells (total target genes: ERRa,
n ¼ 280; AIB1, n ¼ 389). This lack of cross-binding reactivity was
maintained independent of the applied tamoxifen treatment
(data not shown). Thus, we uncovered a global reprogramming
of ERa, ERRa, and AIB1 target regulation in tamoxifen-resistant
breast cancer cells.
We further investigated whether AIB1 speciﬁcally colocalizes to
ERa or ERRa target genes in tamoxifen-resistant cells. However,
we did not observe marked quantitative alterations with functional relevance in the overlapping target gene spectra (Supplementary Fig. S4A–S4B). Although we did not notice pronounced
AIB1 expression changes in tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 cells, we
surprisingly detected a signiﬁcant downregulation of AIB1 mRNA
in relapsed tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer specimens (Supplementary Fig. S4C–S4D). As our data did not provide an indication
for an involvement of AIB1 in the development of resistance, we
focused on the impact of ERa and ERRa in subsequent analyses.
ERa and ERRa functionally cooperate to promote endocrine
resistance beyond their distinct target cistromes
To examine, whether ERa and ERRa regulate similar or different target spectra in tamoxifen-resistant cells, the overlap of these

ERRa and ERa in Antiestrogen Resistance in Breast Cancer

spectra was determined. Surprisingly, despite a small subset of
commonly regulated genes, striking differences were observed
for their target cistromes in both tamoxifen-sensitive and
-resistant MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3F; Supplementary Fig. S4E and
Supplementary Table S7). Comparison of the relative percentage of shared target genes in #Wt (DMSO, 26.5%; 4OHT,
25.5%) and #TamR cells (DMSO, 15%; 4OHT, 23.3%) unraveled an even smaller proportion of common target genes in
resistant cells.
To elucidate the functional relevance of deregulated target
genes, which were speciﬁcally enriched in resistant cells,
deregulated networks were inferred using Ingenuity (Supplementary Table S8). ERa target genes were associated with
cellular processes such as proliferation and cell death (e.g.,
MAP4K4, MYB, and TET2, Fig. 3G). Although ERRa induced a
different set of downstream effectors (e.g., CCNE1, PDGFC, and
RUNX1), these were associated with similar pathophysiologic
processes (e.g., proliferation), suggesting a functional redundancy between ERa and ERRa. Furthermore, we identiﬁed
common ERa and ERRa target genes, which have been already
linked with different forms of resistance in other tumor types
(e.g., ADD3; ref. 30).
The potential of ERa to promote endocrine-resistant breast
cancer proliferation and to predict patient outcome has been
demonstrated earlier (31, 32). Correspondingly, we set out to
assess the impact of ERRa on the proliferation behavior in MCF-7
#Wt, #TamR, and #FulvR cells, as another antiestrogen-resistant
model, using lentiviral-mediated shRNA knockdown. Western
blot analyses conﬁrmed effective silencing of ERRa expression
and cell proliferation assays detected a signiﬁcant reduction in
proliferation of #TamR and #FulvR cells upon ERRa knockdown
with two independent shRNAs that was not evident in #Wt cells
(Fig. 4A). Remarkably, #TamR cells were stronger affected from
ERRa loss than #Wt cells, suggestive for a higher requirement of
resistant cells on functional ERRa signaling. Comparable effects
of the ERRa knockdown on proliferation were achieved in the
presence of the respective antiestrogens (Supplementary Fig. S5),
indicating that the contribution of ERRa to overcome the tamoxifen- and fulvestrant-induced growth inhibition is not tightly
linked to the ERa function.
The transactivation properties of ERRa can be abolished with
the small-molecule inhibitor XCT790 (12). Administration of
XCT790 impaired the viability of MCF-7 #TamR and #FulvR cells
to a stronger extent than #Wt cells as measured by MTS assays (Fig.
4B).
Next, we interfered simultaneously with the function of ERRa
and ERa (Fig. 4C). Dual targeting of ERa and ERRa resulted in a
signiﬁcant reduction of cell viability in #TamR cells. This ﬁnding
was conﬁrmed in cells cultured in the presence of fulvestrant
instead of tamoxifen (Fig. 4D). Similar effects were further
observed in #FulvR cells (Fig. 4C and D, bottom). In accordance
with the established cross-resistance of fulvestrant-resistant breast
cancers toward tamoxifen (33), #FulvR cells were unresponsive

toward tamoxifen, but were partly resensitized toward fulvestrant
upon simultaneous inhibition of ERRa.
As ERRa sustained proliferation in vitro, we investigated its
impact on cell proliferation in breast cancer specimens. ERRa
and KI-67 protein expression was determined by immunohistochemical staining of a TMA covering 1,041 informative ERapositive primary breast carcinomas (Fig. 4E and for extended
panel Supplementary Fig. S6, Supplementary Table S1, tumor
set III). ERRa was primarily located in the nucleus, although we
also observed weak cytoplasmic staining. We here considered
solely nuclear staining in line with our focus on the transcriptional activities of ERRa. In good agreement with the in vitro
ﬁndings, strong nuclear ERRa expression, found in approximately 13% to 20% of tumors, associated with a higher proliferation index ( , P ¼ 0.0033, Fig. 4F). Within the same
cohort, we observed a positive dependency between ERRa
expression and increased p53 expression ( , P ¼ 0.0042) and
the association with AIB1 ( , P < 0.0001, Supplementary Table
S9), which has been previously reported by our group in
another patient cohort (6).
ERRa associates with a shortened overall survival in endocrinetreated patients with breast cancer
As the in vitro ﬁndings suggested an involvement of ERRa in
the pathogenesis of tamoxifen resistance, we examined the
potential of ERRa expression to predict patients' outcome upon
tamoxifen treatment. ERRa mRNA expression data were
retrieved from a gene-expression proﬁling dataset (GSE9893;
ref. 23) of adjuvant tamoxifen-treated primary breast tumors.
Subsequent Kaplan–Meier estimates revealed a signiﬁcantly
reduced overall survival (OS;  , P ¼ 0.02905, Fig. 5A) for
patients with high ERRa-expressing tumors. Likewise, the predictive power of ERRa on protein level was analyzed by IHC.
The above-mentioned TMA contains a subset of patients
with a tamoxifen monotherapy treatment history (tumor
set IV). Analysis of this patient cohort again uncovered
a correlation between ERRa expression and a shortened OS
( , P ¼ 0.00974, Fig. 5B).
The impact of standard clinicopathologic parameters on survival was evaluated in multivariate analyses for both patient
cohorts (Table 2). Cox analyses revealed the following independent predictors for an early recurrence upon endocrine therapy:
ERRa [HR, 3.30;  , P ¼ 0.0118 (GSE9893) and HR, 2.72;  , P ¼
0.007 (tumor set IV)], grade [HR, 2.74;  , P ¼ 0.0047 (GSE9893)]
and PR [HR, 0.39;  , P ¼ 0.0442 (GSE9893)]. ERRa was the only
factor identiﬁed in both patient cohorts and also upon stratiﬁcation to grade and PR in the GSE9893 dataset, ERRa was still the
only signiﬁcant factor (HR, 3.72;  , P ¼ 0.0095, Supplementary
Table S10).
Altogether, these data emphasize that high ERRa expression in
breast tumors correlates with a diminished response toward
endocrine therapy underlining the contribution of ERRa to the
acquisition of endocrine resistance.

Discussion
Integrated molecular analyses uncovered a multitude of
mechanisms underlying antiestrogen resistance, which initially
appeared as attractive targets for therapeutic intervention in breast
cancer (4). However, in line with the anticipated heterogeneity of
drug-tolerant cell populations, the monotherapeutic efﬁcacy of
most of them yielded disappointing results in the clinic, highlighting the need for alternative drug targets and combined treatment
approaches. ERRa has been identiﬁed as a prognostic biomarker
for an unfavorable patient outcome in mammary carcinomas
(5, 13, 34), underlining a pathophysiologic relevance of ERRa in
the etiology of breast cancer.

Nevertheless, the role of the interplay between ERRa and
ERa in endocrine resistance has been basically undetermined.
Our combined in vitro and tumor data suggest that ERa and
ERRa adopt a novel set of target genes in tamoxifen-resistant
cells, and that they functionally cooperate to promote endocrine resistance, despite the apparent existence of speciﬁc target
gene spectra. We further provide evidence that ERRa is a
predictor of reduced patient survival upon tamoxifen therapy,
and that its inhibition leads to a reduced proliferation in
endocrine-resistant cells.
Because of the limited availability of respective patient material, only few studies so far included tamoxifen-resistant recurrent
tumors. Apart from the overall diminished ERa expression, which
is in good agreement with earlier reports (35, 36), three quarters of
tamoxifen-resistant tumors retained the capacity for canonical
ERa signaling as assessed by the surrogate marker PR. The target
gene-speciﬁc differential ERa-driven transcriptional response
found in tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 cells, and the selective regulation of target genes, which are linked to endocrine resistance
(e.g., CCND1; ref. 4), denotes that ERa actively primes expression
of target genes with relevance to resistance. This hypothesis is
supported by the reversal of the tamoxifen-resistant phenotype
upon disruption of the DNA-binding ability of ERa (37) and the
recent identiﬁcation of mutations in ERa in endocrine-resistant
tumors (38, 39). For ERRa, there is currently no appropriate
readout system available to access its activation status in breast
tissue, but the slight upregulation in tamoxifen-resistant tumors
and MCF-7 cells point at a causative role of ERRa in the acquisition of resistance.
Although AIB1 seems to function as the major coactivator of
ERa and ERRa in primary breast cancer (6, 17), conﬂicting results
have been generated with respect to its role in tamoxifen resistance. The cumulating evidence, which argues against a strong
contribution (40, 41), is consistent with our data as we detected a
downregulation of AIB1 in recurrent tamoxifen-resistant tumors.
The genome-wide reprogramming of ERa and ERRa to a newly
acquired set of target genes raises the hypothesis that this redirection drives endocrine resistance. This assumption is in accordance with similar ﬁndings by Hurtado and colleagues and Ross-

ERRa and ERa in Antiestrogen Resistance in Breast Cancer

Innes and colleagues (19, 20), who evaluated ERa-binding sites
identiﬁed by ChIP-Seq, but did not focus on the global combination with transcriptional changes.
In the past, the structural relationship between ERRa and ERa
and the corresponding existence of a few commonly regulated
target genes (e.g., pS2; refs. 9, 14), led to the hypothesis that ERRa
circumvents the requirement for ERa in antiestrogen-resistant
breast carcinomas. Our data unambiguously demonstrate the
existence of speciﬁc target repertoires for ERa and ERRa in
tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells, implying that both engage
in different transcriptional activities. Because ERRa is not directly
affected by ERa antagonists such as tamoxifen (11), it can stimulate target gene expression independently of ERa to promote
tamoxifen resistance. The resulting relative small proportion of
overlapping target genes (15%–26.5%) is compatible with earlier
reports that uncovered a distinct binding site preference in endocrine-responsive breast cancer (15, 42).
ERRa and ERa are regulated by oncogenic pathways, such
as EGFR- or HER-2/neu, which are often inappropriately
activated in antiestrogen resistance (4, 16, 43) and affect
posttranslational modiﬁcations on nuclear hormone receptors. Irrespective of the presence of a ligand, tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 cells are characterized by a constitutive phosphorylation of ERa at S118, which stimulates ligand-independent
activation and reduces ERa's afﬁnity for DNA and tamoxifen
binding (44). If inappropriate growth factor signaling indeed
induces ligand-independent ERa binding via S118 phosphorylation and a corresponding target gene adaption on the
genome-wide scale, our data provide a plausible biologic
explanation for the clinically observed phenomenon that
activated growth factor signaling abrogates response toward
endocrine therapy (4).
ERRa's mode of action is poorly understood, but it appears
to act in a constitutive active cell context-, and promoterdependent manner (14, 45, 46). It is assumed to possess
speciﬁc signaling activities in dependency of the intrinsic breast
cancer subtypes (15). As it has been hypothesized that Luminal
B carcinomas, which largely overlap with antiestrogen-resistant
tumors (47), evolve from endocrine-responsive Luminal A
tumors (47–49), a subgroup switch would provide a rational
explanation for the changed ERRa target spectrum in tamoxifen-resistant cells.
Despite the existence of entirely different transcriptional
networks, we identiﬁed ERa and ERRa target genes in tamoxifen-resistant cells that feed into similar resistance-promoting
processes such as cell proliferation (i.e., ERa, CCND1 and
ERRa, CCNE1; ref. 4), indicative for a functional redundancy.
Several lines of evidence from our analyses underscore that the
predicted functions of speciﬁc deregulated target genes in
resistant cells indeed have phenotypic implications regarding
proliferation: First, we found a positive relationship between
ERRa and the proliferation marker KI-67 in a large panel of
ERa-positive breast carcinomas. Second, our functional analyses unraveled that tamoxifen-resistant cells have a higher
requirement for ERRa than sensitive cells to sustain proliferation. The comparable phenotype in fulvestrant-resistant cells
may point at a broader function of ERRa in the adaption
toward endocrine therapy in permanently ERa-depleted cell
populations. This idea is in good agreement with earlier in vitro
and mouse xenograft experiments, which also indicated an
indispensable role of ERRa for the proliferation of ERa-nega-

www.aacrjournals.org

tive breast cancer cells (7, 42). Importantly, the preclinical
observations were reﬂected by the clinical course: ERRa expression correlated with a reduced OS in independent endocrinetreated patient cohorts.
Currently, drugs targeting ERRa that possess the desired
properties for a clinical application are not yet available, but
a principle druggability of the transcription factor has been
demonstrated in vitro and in vivo (7, 42). Moreover, the respective ERRa knockout mouse is characterized by a fairly moderate
phenotype (50), which increases the likelihood of tolerable
side effects.
In conclusion, we identiﬁed ERRa as a potential key mediator
of endocrine resistance and underline the prevailing view that ERa
preserves a pivotal role in tamoxifen-resistant breast carcinomas.
Despite the existence of distinct ERRa and ERa target repertoires,
their concerted action presents a potential resistance scenario and
reinforces the concept of combinatorial targeting strategies directed against both nuclear receptors. Hence, we provide a rationale to
consider ERRa as a potential drug target in endocrine-resistant
breast carcinomas that do not respond to ﬁrst-line antiestrogen
therapy.
