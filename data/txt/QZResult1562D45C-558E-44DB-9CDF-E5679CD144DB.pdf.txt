BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is treated with conventional induction chemotherapy shortly after diagnosis for the
majority of patients aged 65 years. A recent report suggested a substantial decline in the early, or 1-month, mortality rate in patients
treated on clinical trials over the past 2 decades. It is unknown whether a similar improvement has been observed in the general population. METHODS: The authors examined the 1-month mortality rate in a large population-based series of 9380 patients with AML
who were aged 65 years and were diagnosed and treated with chemotherapy between 1973 and 2010. RESULTS: A significant
decline was observed in the 1-month mortality rate from 18.7% among patients diagnosed from 1973 through 1977 (95% confidence
interval [95% CI], 16.4%-21.2%) to 5.8% for those diagnosed between 2008 and 2010 (95% CI, 4.5%-7.6%) (P <.001). The median overall survival improved significantly from 6 months (95% CI, 5 months-7 months) in 1973 to 1977 to 23 months (95% CI, 16 months-20
months) in 2008 to 2010 (P <.001). Although age and geographic variation were found to significantly influence the 1-month mortality for the period between 1973 and 1977, these differences in 1-month mortality were no longer significant among patients with AML
who were treated more recently (2008-2010). CONCLUSIONS: Over the past 4 decades, early mortality has become uncommon in
younger patients (aged 65 years) with newly diagnosed AML undergoing induction chemotherapy. It is encouraging that the
improvements noted in 1-month mortality rate among a selective cohort of patients in clinical trials have also been observed in a

INTRODUCTION
Without treatment, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is uniformly fatal within weeks to months.1 For the past 40 years,
most younger patients (aged 65 years) with AML have received treatment combining infusional cytarabine with an
anthracycline (most commonly daunorubicin, using the 7 1 3 regimen) shortly after diagnosis.2,3 With this combination,
the complete remission rate in patients aged <60 years ranges between 60% and 80%.4,5 The complete remission rates in
patients aged >60 years are significantly lower.6,7 Primary refractory disease is reported in approximately 15% to 30% of
younger patients, depending on the series and type of induction therapy. The remaining patients with AML experience a
fatal complication within 1 month of diagnosis (known as early death or treatment-related mortality).8-10 Death most
commonly occurs from infectious or bleeding complications related to cytopenias. The risk of mortality decreases significantly 4 weeks from the time of treatment initiation.10
Retrospective data combined from 2 large cohorts of patients treated on clinical trials have indicated that 1-month
mortality has declined significantly over the past 2 decades.11 The reasons for this decrease may be related to improved
supportive measures during the period of bone marrow aplasia, including empiric initiation of potent, broad-spectrum
antibiotics and antifungals; strict adherence to guidelines regarding the management of neutropenic fever; and improved
transfusion support before count recovery.
However, to our knowledge it remains unknown whether the decline in early mortality rates reported among highly
selected patients treated on clinical trials and in tertiary care centers has also been observed in the general population. It
has been estimated that only 5% to 10% of patients with AML participate in clinical trials.12 In the current study, we set

out to examine the 1-month mortality in a large
population-based series of patients with AML undergoing
chemotherapy using a representative national sample.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population

Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
(SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute, we
obtained information regarding all 10,940 patients diagnosed with a first primary AML (International Classification
of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd Edition [ICD-O-3] histology
codes 9840, 9861, 9865, 9867, 9870-9874, 9891, 98959897, 9910, 9920, 9930, and 9931) between the age of 18
years and 65 years during the period January 1, 1973
through December 31, 2011 in 9 SEER regions (San
Francisco-Oakland, Connecticut, Detroit [Metropolitan],
Hawaii, Iowa, New Mexico, Seattle [Puget Sound], Utah,
and Atlanta [Metropolitan]) for which data were available
since 1973. We excluded those patients diagnosed with
acute promyelocytic leukemia (ICD-O-3 code 9866). The
cancer registrar recorded AML patients based on the interpreting pathologist’s documentation. We excluded, in a
hierarchical manner, 54 patients who were diagnosed by
death certificate only, 81 who had 0 days of survival, and
1425 who did not have a record of ever having received
chemotherapy. The final study population included 9380
patients. For each AML case, we obtained information routinely abstracted from the medical record regarding patient
age at diagnosis, race/ethnicity, and stage of disease at diagnosis, as well as treatment within the first 12 months after
diagnosis. We also obtained vital status as of December 31,
2011 and the underlying cause of death from the death
certificate.
For analysis of the effect of time period on 1-month
mortality, we divided the cohort into 5-year increments
based on date of diagnosis. For analysis of the effect of geographical location, we divided the 9 SEER regions into 3
categories based on 1-month mortality from 1973 through
1977: lowest early death rate (Detroit [Metropolitan]); intermediate early death rate (Atlanta [Metropolitan], Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, San Francisco-Oakland Standard
Metropolitan Statistical Area [SMSA], Seattle [Puget
Sound], and Utah); and highest early death rate (New Mexico). We assessed the 1-month mortality in these 3 cohorts
over time, using the same 5-year increments.

mortality rate (and associated 95% confidence intervals
[95% CIs]) from the vital status recorded in SEER with
follow-up through December 31, 2010 by year of diagnosis. We calculated the 1-month mortality rate event as
death occurring within 1 month of the recorded date of
AML diagnosis.
Linear regression weighted on standard error was
used to measure and test for the statistical significance of
the annual trend in 1-month mortality rates across time
periods. Regressions and calculations of the coefficient of
determination [R2] and b statistics were performed using
SAS statistical software (version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc,
Cary, NC). All P values reported were 2-sided, and those
that were <.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed by one of us (L.T.).
This project was overseen by the Institutional Review
Board of the Cancer Prevention Institute of California.
RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics

The baseline characteristics of the 9380 patients who met
the inclusion criteria between 1973 and 2010 are presented
in Table 1. As expected, there was an elevated male-tofemale ratio (1.23:1), and non-Hispanic white individuals
represented the majority of patients (75.4%). The incidence of AML increased with advancing age, whereas the
median age at diagnosis over the study period remained
unchanged (50 years for entire cohort). The incidence rate
of AML remained stable when measured in 5-year increments from 1973 to 2010. The 1-month mortality rate for
the entire cohort was 10.4% (95% CI, 9.8%-11.0%).
We observed changes in the composition of AML
diagnoses with respect to histologic classification over time.
The introduction of the cytogenetic-based World Health
Organization classification in 2001 and the associated
change in diagnostic codes to ICD-O-3 provided more
granularity in AML subtyping (Table 2). The new classification of AML entities led to a decrease in the percentage of
patients coded as 9861/3 (AML) from 78.6% in 1973
through 2000 to 46.4% in 2001 through 2010. For those
entities in which the cytogenetic-based classification is not
relevant, such as 9840/3 (acute erythroid leukemia), the
percentage of patients reported remained stable (2.1%
from 1973-2000 and 2.1% from 2001-2010).

Statistical Analysis

Effect of Time Period of Diagnosis on Median
OS and 1-Month Mortality Rate

We used the SEER*Stat software program (version 6.7;
National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Md) to calculate
overall survival (OS) rates, median OS, and 1-month

We assessed whether the time period of diagnosis affected
the median OS. Throughout the study period, the median
age at diagnosis ranged between 50 years and 52 years

(Table 3). However, during this time, we observed a significant improvement in the median OS from 6 months
(95% CI, 5 months-7 months) in patients diagnosed
between 1973 and 1977 to 18 months (95% CI, 16
months-20 months) in patients diagnosed between 2003
and 2007. At the time of analysis, patients diagnosed in
2009 and 2010 did not have adequate follow-up with
which to calculate their median OS, but the median OS
for patients diagnosed in 2008 had improved further to
23 months (95% CI, 20 months-31 months) (P <.001)
(Table 3) (Fig. 1). Linear regression analysis confirmed a
strong linear trend for improvement in median OS over
time (R2, 0.86) (Fig. 1).

4.5%-7.6%). Weighted linear regression analysis revealed
a strong linear trend in the 1-month mortality rate (R2,
0.78) (Fig. 2), with a steady annual decrease of approximately 0.4% per year (b 5 2.3755). It is interesting to
note that we observed a similar decline in 2-month mortality over the study period (data not shown). Together, in
2007

our cohort over time, we observed a parallel increase in
median OS and a decrease in 1-month mortality.
Impact of Age on 1-Month Mortality Rates

To examine the effect of age on the 1-month mortality
rates of patients with AML, we divided the cohort into 3
age groups spanning approximately 15 years each (Table
4). For all 3 age groups, the 1-month mortality rate was
found to be highest for 1973 through 1977, with older
patients experiencing the highest rates of early death (Table 4) (Fig. 3). Over the study period, a significant
improvement in the 1-month mortality rate was observed
in all age cohorts. The largest absolute improvements
were noted in older patients (an approximately 15% absolute decrease in 1-month mortality for patients aged

51-65 years over the entire time period). Linear regression analysis demonstrated a strong trend toward a
decrease in 1-month mortality in all age cohorts (Fig. 3).
For all age cohorts, the 1-month mortality rate was lowest in the most recent time period (2008-2010), without
significant differences in 1-month mortality observed
among age cohorts (P 5 .3347 between the cohort aged
51-65 years and the cohort aged 18-35 years, and
P 5 .2531 between the cohort aged 36-50 years and the
cohort aged 18-35 years). In summary, 1-month mortality rates appear to have improved among patients with
AML who are aged 65 years, with particular benefit
noted in patients aged 51 to 65 years at the time of
diagnosis.

We next examined whether location at diagnosis had an
effect on 1-month mortality. We examined the 1-month
mortality rate in the 9 SEER regions, and found improvement over time in each region (Fig. 4A). We further divided the 9 SEER regions into 3 groups based on the 1month mortality in the earliest time period included in
the current analysis (1973-1977); the 1-month mortality
rate in these 3 groups was then evaluated over time. Little
absolute improvement in the 1-month mortality rate was
observed in the group with initial low early death, decreasing minimally from 9.1% (95% CI, 3.5%-22.4%)
between 1973 and 1977 to 7.1% (95% CI, 2.7%-17.9%)
between 2008 and 2010 (Table 5) (Fig. 4B). Conversely,
the results of the current analyses revealed significant

declines in 1-month mortality in the cohorts of patients
with high and intermediate early death rates. This mismatched improvement in the 1-month mortality resulted
in a convergence of the early death rates observed among
patients with AML from all geographic areas for the 2008
through 2010 period (Fig. 4B). As such, the results of the
current study demonstrated a lack of significant differences in 1-month mortality in the period between 2008 and

has decreased by nearly 70% over the same time frame.
This improvement in 1-month mortality was noted in all
patient cohorts, independent of age or geographic region
at the time of diagnosis. The current study results also
indicated that the 1-month mortality has particularly
improved among patients aged 51 years to 65 years, and
among those from certain geographic areas with high and
intermediate initial 1-month mortality rates.
The reasons for the decreases in 1-month mortality
remain largely unexplained, because there is no clear
inflection point in the observed improvement over time.
Recently, significant improvements in survival attributable to supportive care were reported in patients with hematologic malignancies after allogeneic transplant, and
similar mechanisms likely account for the improvements
observed in the patients with AML reported herein.13
Bleeding and infections are the most common issues leading to treatment-related early death; relevant advances in
the management of patients with AML who are undergoing aggressive chemotherapy over this time period
include rigorous prophylactic platelet transfusions and
breakthroughs in the management of infectious complications, particularly fungal disease.14-16
The observations in the current study are particularly powerful because the study data set was derived from
a large, representative, national cohort identified from the
high-quality SEER program. The program covers 28% of
new cancer diagnoses in the United States, although the
coverage was lower in 1973 when SEER was established
and when the data collection for this study began. In addition, the patient characteristics in the current study cohort
2010

have generally remained similar over time (Table 1).
Although improvements in early death rates have been
reported among patients participating in AML clinical trials,11 such beneficial effects in outcomes are frequently
not observed in individuals receiving therapy in the “real
world.”17 In addition, only 5% to 10% of patients with
AML in the United States are estimated to participate in
clinical trials, potentially limiting the generalizability of
those findings.12 In fact, in a highly curable subtype of
AML, acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a clear disparity exists between the low early death rates observed on
clinical trials (approximately 10%) compared with the
much higher rates noted in population-based analyses
(ranging from approximately 15%-30%).18-21 These differences in outcomes exist even though recent data have
indicated that >70% of patients newly diagnosed with
APL participate in research protocols.22 However, in contrast to the findings noted among patients with APL, the
current study results in a cohort of patients with AML
drawn from the general population noted improvements
over time in 1-month mortality that were comparable to
those observed in a large clinical trial-based population.11
An unusual finding in the current study was the large variability in 1-month mortality based on geographic location
in the earliest time periods; further study should be
devoted to answering this question.
The current study had the benefit of being large and
representative, but has several important limitations.
SEER data do not contain details regarding what type of
chemotherapy regimen patients received (including the
potential need for reinduction chemotherapy), compliance to therapy, or when chemotherapy was initiated.
Therefore, if delays existed in diagnosis or the initiation of
treatment, the 1-month survival rate we reported might
instead be a less meaningful 2-week or 3-week survival
rate for some patients; however, we also observed a
decrease in 2-month mortality over the same time period,
which suggests that the trend in improvement is valid
regardless of variations in the timing of initiation of
chemotherapy. The SEER data set also does not include
standard baseline characteristics often used to riskstratify patients with AML such as performance status,
white blood cell count, percentage of bone marrow
blasts, and cytogenetics, although it seems unlikely that
these characteristics would vary significantly over time in
the population.5 During the study period, the percentage
of blasts needed to make the diagnosis of AML changed
from 30% to 20%; however, this change in classification
would affect any longitudinal study of patients with
AML.

Improvements in Early Death Rate in AML/Percival et al

Although the median age at the time of AML diagnosis is reported to be 67 years, we chose to limit the current
study population to patients between the ages of 18 years
and 65 years.23 First, we performed our analyses only
among those patients confirmed to have received at least 1
dose of chemotherapy, which is not universally considered
in patients aged >65 years at the time of diagnosis. In fact,
a recent analysis of a SEER-Medicare-linked database of
patients aged >65 years with newly diagnosed AML demonstrated that only 40% of these patients receive chemotherapy.24 In addition, the cohort of 9380 patients we
selected likely received relatively homogenous therapies,
because population-based registries have previously shown
that only 5% of patients aged <65 years are not treated
with induction chemotherapy.3,25 Finally, it has been previously demonstrated that advanced age in patients with
AML is associated with disproportionately high early mortality, decreased treatment rates, and a decreased use of conventional induction chemotherapy with a preference for
lower-intensity regimens such as low-dose cytarabine or
hypomethylating agents.26-29 The goal of the current study
was to examine patients likely to have undergone standard
induction chemotherapy, and patients aged >65 years
likely did not meet that criterion.30 We would expect that
only a small minority of patients in the current study cohort
would have been treated upfront with hypomethylating
agents because azacitidine was only approved by the US
Food and Drug Administration in 2004 and is typically
used in patients aged >60 years.
Overall, the improvements in early mortality and OS
observed in the population-based cohort of patients with
AML in the current study are reassuring and consistent
with clinical trial results.11 Previous analyses have determined that age and performance status are the 2 most important variables influencing treatment-related mortality in
patients with AML.10 The results of the current study failed
to demonstrate a significant inflection point in the early
death rates or OS for younger patients with AML, suggesting that advances in routine clinical care during the study
period are responsible for the progressive and continuous
improvements we observed. Finally, the current study
results suggest that concerns regarding increased early mortality should not be a deterrent to induction chemotherapy
in patients aged <65 years with AML.
