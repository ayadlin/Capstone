BACKGROUND: Patients affected by relapsed or primary refractory lymphomas currently have a poor prognosis and
no standard salvage treatment options. This study was carried out to assess the efficacy and safety of a dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and oxaliplatin as salvage therapy in those patients, replacing cisplatin with oxaliplatin in
the standard dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin scheme. METHODS: Seventy patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin or Hodgkin lymphoma were treated from September 2001 to September 2007. The median age of patients was 51 years (range, 19-75 years). Histological subtypes were: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n ¼
47) and Hodgkin lymphoma (n ¼ 23). The overall response rate was 73% (51 of 70), with 30 (43%) complete remissions and 21 (30%) partial remissions. Fifty-two patients were treated with dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine,
and oxaliplatin as second-line chemotherapy. Forty-eight patients were enrolled in an autologous stem cell transplantation program; forty (83%) finally proceeded to high-dose consolidation and autografting. RESULTS: No grade 3 or
4 nonhematological toxicity was demonstrated; in particular, no renal or neurotoxicity was reported. After a median
follow-up period of 21 months (range, 2-87 months), 22 (31%) patients had died. Probabilities of 2-year progressionfree survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 44% and 71%, respectively. In the chemosensitive patients, the PFS
and OS were 52% and 83%, respectively. The only factor that significantly correlated with better OS was the response
to therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and oxaliplatin  rituximab is an effective and feasible outpatient regimen for salvage therapy in patients affected by relapsed or refractory
lymphoma. Moreover, the feasibility and efficacy of this scheme as an in vivo chemosensitive test in patients in autoC 2010 American Cancer Society.

About 40% to 60% of patients affected by aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) fail to achieve complete remis-

sion (CR) after an anthracycline-based first-line chemotherapy or relapse after obtaining CR.1 The majority of patients
with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) can be cured with initial treatment, but at least 15% to 20% of them experience early
relapse or have refractory disease.2 All these patients are generally characterized by a poor prognosis and will thus need a
salvage chemotherapy. High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is the most
successful approach for chemosensitive patients, although advanced age or comorbidity can prevent the patient from being
put forward for a bone marrow transplantation. It is absolutely necessary to offer an effective, well-tolerated, and possibly
mobilizing salvage chemotherapy with lower toxicities. The most widely accepted salvage regimens are platinum-containing (such as dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin; etoposide, Solu-Medrol, high-dose cytarabine, and platinum; adriamycin (ADR), solumedrol, cytarabine (ARA-C), cisplatin (CDPP) (ASHAP); ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide) or

ifosfamide-based (mesna, ifosfamide, mitoxantrone, etoposide; methylprednisolone, cytarabine, cisplatin
[MINE-ESHAP], ifosfamide, methotrexate VP16
[IMVP16]).3-8 Dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin
has been previously demonstrated in a long-term followup study to have a response rate of 43%, with a median
survival of 6 months.9 This regimen has also been used in
patients with indolent NHL and as a salvage regimen in
refractory or relapsed HL. In a paper by Olivieri et al,10
the sequence dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin
debulking mobilization followed by autologous stem cell
transplantation demonstrated that it was feasible and
effective in a high percentage of patients with high-grade
NHL and HL. The addition of rituximab to the dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin regimen in patients
with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
has proven to be more effective, leading to a higher percentage of complete remission and similar overall remission compared with dexamethasone, cytarabine, and
cisplatin alone.11
Oxaliplatin is a third-generation platinum compound with a different spectrum of cytotoxicity than cisplatin or carboplatin. It has be proven to be effective in
solid tumors, such as cisplatin-refractory ovarian carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, and small cell lung cancer.
Compared with cisplatin, oxaliplatin has a minor renal or
auditory toxicity. The first report of oxaliplatin activity in
refractory or recurrent NHL is by Germann et al.12 Of 22
pretreated patients affected by refractory or relapsed Bcell lymphoma, oxaliplatin at a dose of 100 mg/m2 or 130
mg/m2 has shown a 40% overall response rate in the different histological subgroups. Its safety and efficacy thus
represent a good option for salvage regimen in heavily pretreated patients.13,14
In the present study, we modified the dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin regimen, replacing cisplatin with oxaliplatin and administering cytarabine on Days
2 and 3 to evaluate efficacy and safety in 70 refractory or
relapsed patients affected by aggressive NHL or by HL,
who were treated as outpatients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Seventy patients affected by relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell NHL and HL were followed from 2001 to
2007 at the Departments of Hematology of Alessandria,
Florence, Siena, and Turin Hospitals and were evaluated
in a multicenter retrospective analysis. Inclusion criteria
were: histological proven diagnosis of aggressive high-

4574

grade NHL or HL according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, documented relapse after
previous chemotherapy or disease resistant to chemotherapy, older than 18 years, and no previous platinum-containing chemotherapy.
Oxaliplatin was delivered as a 2-hour intravenous
infusion at a dose of 130 mg/m2 on Day 1. Cytarabine
was given on Days 2 and 3 at a dose of 2 g/m2 intravenously (first dose: 3-hour infusion on Day 2 at 3:00 PM
and second dose: 3-hour infusion on Day 3 at 8:00 AM),
and dexamethasone 40 mg was administered orally from
Days 1 to 4. Rituximab was administered on Day 0 at a
dose of 375 mg/m2 in patients with NHL. (This began in
2003 when the Italian health authorities allowed the use
of the monoclonal antibody, anti-CD20, in diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma.) The cycle was repeated every 3 weeks
for a total of 2 to 6 cycles.
Peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization and
PBSC harvest were planned after the second cycle of dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and oxaliplatin in
patients who were candidates to receive a high-dose therapy with ASCT. All patients who were candidates for mobilization had to have a negative bone marrow histology
before the apheresis.
Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was routinely
administered from Day 7 to Day 12. As supportive care,
patients received allopurinol 300 mg daily, and cotrimoxazole and sulfamethoxazole 960 mg twice a week for
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis.
Patients had blood samples taken on Day 7 or Day
10 and before starting the next cycle. In case of persistent
hematological toxicity grade 3 on the day of treatment, all
drug treatments were delayed until the blood count recovered; whereas in case of grade 3 nonhematological toxicity, treatment was stopped. CR was defined as the
complete disappearance of any radiological or biological
lesions present at diagnosis and the absence of new lesions.
Partial remission (PR) was defined as regression by >50%
of the measurable lesions and the absence of new lesions.
Stable disease was defined as the regression by <50% of
all measurable lesions without the appearance of any new
lesions. Progressive disease was defined as the appearance
of new lesions or the growth of any initial lesion by
>50%. Nonresponders (NRs) were those patients who
obtained less than PR or discontinued treatment because
of adverse effects and those who died.15
Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the start
date of salvage treatment until death from any cause or
until last patient contact, whereas disease-free survival

(DFS) was taken from the date of CR (for relapsed
patients we used the date of second complete remission)
to the date of relapse or of last contact, and the curves
were measured only using patients in CR after induction
therapy. Progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated
from start of salvage treatment until progression, relapse,
death, or last follow-up. Toxicity was defined according
to the WHO toxicity grading scale.

Statistical Analysis
All included patients were considered in the statistical
analysis. OS, DFS, and PFS were estimated according to
the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test was used to
assess the significance of differences for each prognostic
factor in the univariate analysis. The Cox proportional
hazards regression model and the logistic regression models were used to assess how patients’ characteristics predict
DFS and OS. Our data were analyzed using the Statistical
Package for Social Science.16 The limit of significance for
all analyses was defined as P ¼ .05. A 2-tailed test was
used in all calculations.

RESULTS
From 2001 to 2007, 70 patients were treated at the hematology departments of Alessandria, Florence, Siena, and
Turin hospitals. All patients were evaluated and included
in the statistical analysis. Table 1 shows the patients’ characteristics. Median age was 51 years (range, 19-75 years);
there were 45 men and 25 women; 47 (67%) had diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma, and 23 (33%) had HL.
At diagnosis, according to the Ann Arbor Classification, 7 (10%) patients were at stage I, 22 (31%) at stage
II, 20 (29%) at stage III, and 21 (30%) at stage IV.
Twenty (29%) patients had B symptoms, and 22 (31%)
had bulky disease. According to the International Prognostic Index, when considering only the NHL patients,
there were 18 patients at low, 16 at low/intermediate, 9 at
intermediate/high, and 4 at high risk. The overall number
of cycles administered was 233, and the median number
was 4 (range, 2-6). Thirty-four patients received 2 cycles
of chemotherapy; 24 patients received 4 cycles, 2 patients
received 5 cycles, and 10 patients received 6 cycles. Fiftytwo patients received dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and oxaliplatin as second-line therapy and 18 as

third-line (4 after high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT).
Twenty-three patients were considered to have primary
tumors refractory to induction therapy. In refractory
patients, dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and oxaliplatin therapy was used as a chemosensitive test to take
patients toward a high-dose therapy and subsequently
ASCT. Forty-eight patients were enrolled in an ASCT
program; 46 (96%) of the 48 had an adequate peripheral
stem cell collection, and 2 patients did not. The ASCT
program was finally performed in 40 (83%). Autologous
stem cell transplantations were planned in 25 patients
with NHL and successfully performed in 19 of them. Six
patients did not perform the ASCT, in 2 of them because
of lack of PBSC collection and in the other 4 because of
disease progression. Among the Hodgkin patients, ASCT
was planned in 23 cases and performed in 21 of them; 1
patient refused the procedure, and for the other patient
the therapeutic program was modified to a reduced-intensity allogeneic transplantation. No dose reduction was
required. Treatment was delayed in 29 (12%) cycles
mostly because of hematological toxicity. Eight patients
did not complete the planned therapy; the reason for stopping treatment was disease progression. Nineteen (40%)
of 47 NHL patients did not receive rituximab.
Response to Treatment
The response rate was evaluated 1 month after completion
of therapy. After the induction therapy, the overall
response rate was 73% (51 of 70), with 30 complete
remissions (43%) and 21 partial remissions (30%); 19
patients were refractory (27%). The only factor that significantly affected obtaining a response to therapy was the

time from diagnosis to dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and oxaliplatin therapy. Complete remission was
significantly higher in patients treated with salvage therapy >1 year from diagnosis (53%) in comparison with
those relapsed within 1 year (34%) (P ¼ .01). According
to histological subtypes, the overall response rate was 72%
and 74% in NHL and HL, respectively. In NHL patients,
we did not find any differences in terms of overall
response according to whether rituximab was used or not
used (respectively, 78% and 75%). Twenty-three (33%)
patients had refractory primary tumors; 5 achieved CR
and 6 PR, with an overall response rate of 48%. Eight
(73%) of these responding patients performed ASCT,
and the remaining 3 did not because of advanced age.
Only 4 (33%) out 12 patients who did not respond to
dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and oxaliplatin
were treated with ASCT. Finally, 40 (83%) of 48 patients
proceeded to high-dose consolidation and autografting.
Twenty-seven patients were in CR, 9 were in PR, and 4
had active disease at the moment of transplantation. After
high-dose therapy and autologous transplantation, 1
more patient achieved CR (28 CRs), 2 patients progressed
rapidly and died, and the other 10 were alive but with
active disease.
OS and Event-Free Survival
At the time of this analysis, the median follow-up was 21
months (range, 2-87 months), 48 (69%) patients were
alive, and 22 (31%) had died, 21 because of disease progression and 1 because of sepsis. Overall survival was 71%

at 2 years and 58% at 5 years (Fig. 1). According to the
histotype, it was 58% at 2 years and 39% at 5 years in
NHL patients and 95% at 2 years and 89% at 5 years in
HL patients (P ¼ .001) (Fig. 2). OS was statistically significantly better (P ¼ .0004) in patients with chemosensitive disease in comparison to refractory disease (83% vs
38% at 2 years). Patients who underwent the programmed ASCT showed a significantly better overall survival rate, in comparison with those who did not (P ¼
.01). In univariate analysis, OS was significantly affected
by the histotype (Hodgkin vs non-Hodgkin: P ¼ .001),
response to salvage therapy (CR vs PR and NR: P ¼
.000), remission status at ASCT (P ¼ .001), and performance of autologous PBSC transplantation (P ¼ .0004). In

multivariate analysis, only remission status at ASCT was
notable (P ¼ .004).
PFS was 44% at 2 years and 35% at 5 years; according to histotype, it was 35% at 2 years and 23% at 5 years
in NHL patients and 64% at 2 years and 50% at 5 years in
HL patients (P ¼ .008) (Fig. 3). PFS was statistically better (P ¼ .01) in patients with chemosensitive disease in
comparison to the refractory patients (52% vs 28% at 2
years). In the univariate analysis, PFS was significantly
affected by response to salvage therapy (CR vs PR and
NR: P ¼ .000), remission status at ASCT (P ¼ .000), and
performed autologous PBSC transplantation (P ¼ .01).
In the multivariate analysis, only the response to salvage
therapy was notable (P ¼ .0000).

Stem Cell Mobilizing Capacity of
Dexamethasone, High-Dose Cytarabine,
and Oxaliplatin
Adequate stem cell mobilization was obtained in 46 of 48
eligible patients. The median peak number of CD34þ
progenitors was achieved at Days 11 to 13. The median
number of collected CD34þ cells was 6.35  106/kg
body weight (range, 2-20.1). Forty-two of 46 patients collected CD34, with 1 leukapheresis.

Toxicity
Grade 3 and 4 toxicity was mainly hematological (see Table 2); no severe bleeding complications were reported;
and in 11 (16%) patients, prophylactic platelets transfusions were occasionally required. No grade 3 or 4 nonhematological toxicity was demonstrated; in particular no
renal or neurological toxicity was reported (see Table 2).
No toxic deaths were recorded.

DISCUSSION
The present study demonstrates that the dexamethasone,
high-dose cytarabine, and oxaliplatin regimen effected
great activity in 70 patients with relapsed or refractory
Hodgkin or NHL and that this regimen also shows a high
mobilizing efficacy.
The results of the PARMA trial17 demonstrated that
patients who undergo high-dose therapy followed by
ASCT after an adequate response to dexamethasone,
cytarabine, and cisplatin chemotherapy have better failure-free survival and OS rates than patients who only
received dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin. After
the publication of this trial—the only reported study of
patients treated with randomized therapy for relapsed disease—investigators assumed that all regimens were equivalent to dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin in
achieving remission and that any regimen that would
induce a response in a patient with relapsed disease would
have results as good as those for dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin followed by stem cell transplantation.
Overall response rates ranging from 55% to 67%, including CR rates ranging from 15% to 31%, have been previously reported with dexamethasone, cytarabine, and
cisplatin in patients with NHL previously treated with
chemotherapy.3,16,18,19 The results of the dexamethasone,
high-dose cytarabine, and oxaliplatin regimen was first
reported in a paper by Machover et al.20 The overall
response rate and complete remission were, respectively,
73% and 53% in a cohort of 15 patients with different
histologies. Although experimental data for a synergistic
interaction between cytosine arabinoside and oxaliplatin
(L-HOP) are not available, the activity observed in this
study suggests that synergy might occur. Recently, other
studies tested the efficacy and safety of platinum derivative
oxaliplatin in polichemotherapy.21-23 The present study
confirms that the dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine,
and oxaliplatin regimen has significant activity in patients
with NHL or HL who had received prior treatment. Seventy-three percent of the patients responded to therapy,
and 43% attained a CR. No differences were observed in
different histotypes (73% in NHL and 74% in HL).
Forty-eight patients were programmed to receive a stem
cell transplantation; in 46 (96%) of the 48 patients, the
dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and oxaliplatin regimen proved to be highly effective at mobilizing a sufficient number of stem cells, and 40 (83%) patients of these
48 patients underwent high-dose therapy with BCNU
etoposide, aracytin, melphalan (BEAM) and stem cell
transplantation. The dexamethasone, high-dose cytara-

4578

bine, and oxaliplatin regimen proved to be an effective
mobilizing regimen; moreover, it helped in preparing a
large number of relapsed or refractory patients for stem
cell transplantation. Dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and oxaliplatin induced an overall response in 48%
of refractory patients, and 8 out 23 patients with primary
refractory disease (35%) had the possibility of receiving
high-dose therapy and an autologous stem cell transplantation. Dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and oxaliplatin therapy was administered to all patients as
outpatients; the use of oxaliplatin reduced the amount of
fluid and avoided prehydration, and no renal toxicity was
observed. Toxicity was within acceptable limits of tolerance. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia WHO grade 2
to 4 occurred in 55% and 54% of patients, respectively.
However, they were of short duration, did not require
hospitalization and did not result in complications. The
dose-limiting toxic effect of oxaliplatin is sensory peripheral neuropathy. In our transient, peripheral patients, neuropathy was experienced by 14% of the assessable
patients. Neuropathy of grade >2 was not observed in the
present study. Our data confirm that the combination of
L-HOP with high-dose Aracytine did not change the incidence or characteristics of sensory neuropathy. No other
clinically significant extrahematological toxicity was
recorded in the study (see Table 2).
The OS and PFS are significantly higher in patients
with HL in comparison with NHL because HL patients
were treated after first relapse, with the intention to perform high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT. As reported in
the multivariate analysis, the pre-ASCT status is the only
condition that significantly affects a better OS and PFS,
confirming the indispensable role of an effective salvage
therapy.
In conclusion, the present study confirms that dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and oxaliplatin therapy
is highly active for the treatment of patients with HL or
NHL, whether or not they are candidates for high-dose
chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation. The regimen
was able to mobilize adequate numbers of circulating
CD34þ cells, and hematopoietic engraftment occurred
within the expected time in patients receiving ASCT.
Time to neutrophil (>0.5  109/L) and platelet (>20 
109 L) recovery was, respectively, 11 and 16 days. Moreover, this regimen has toxicity characteristics that compare
favorably with those reported in dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin; that patients can be treated as outpatients is also an advantage. The lack of renal toxicity
reported for oxaliplatin-containing regimens means that it

can be considered as a treatment for elderly patients. Our
large cohort of patients confirms that the dexamethasone,
high-dose cytarabine, and oxaliplatin regimen has promising activity, with an acceptable toxicity profile, and could
be a favorable treatment option for relapsed or refractory
lymphoma patients regardless of whether they are eligible
for an autologous transplant.
