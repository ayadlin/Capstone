Abstract
Osteosarcoma is a malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents characterized by intrinsic therapeutic resistance. The IGF2 is expressed at elevated levels in osteosarcoma after treatment with chemotherapy, prompting an examination of its functional contributions to resistance. We found that continuous
exposure to IGF2 or insulin in the absence of serum created a dormant growth state in osteosarcoma
cells that conferred resistance to various chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro. Mechanistic investigations
revealed that this dormant state correlated with downregulation of downstream signaling by the IGF1
receptor, heightened cell survival, enhanced autophagy, and the presence of extracellular glutamine.
Notably, inhibiting autophagy or depleting glutamine was sufﬁcient to increase chemotherapeutic sensitivity
in osteosarcoma xenografts in mice. Clinically, we conﬁrmed that IGF expression levels were elevated in
human osteosarcoma specimens from patients who received chemotherapy. Together, our results suggest
that activation of IGF or insulin signaling preserves the survival of osteosarcoma cells under chemotherapeutic stress, providing a drug-resistant population that may engender minimal residual disease.
Attenuating this survival mechanism may help overcome therapeutic resistance in osteosarcoma. Cancer

Introduction
Osteosarcoma is the most common nonhematogenous
malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents. Death
from osteosarcoma is largely attributable to the unchecked
survival of a chemoresistant cells, and clinical outcomes have
not changed substantially over the past 20 years (1–3).
Characterization of the mechanisms of such chemoresistance will thus be a key to the development of novel therapeutic options.
The emergence of drug-resistant cancer cells has been
attributed to stochastic events mostly associated with genetic
mutations (4, 5). However, the mutation-based mechanism is
thought to occur over a relatively long time period and may
therefore not account for the rapid emergence of latent drugtolerant cells. Instead, nonmutational alterations after the
onset of therapy induced by the modiﬁed microenvironment
also can give rise to a drug-tolerant state in cancer cells (4, 6, 7).
Also importantly, resistant subpopulations of cancer cells,
possibly identical to cancer stem cells, may initially be present
within tumors, and their subsequent enrichment by therapy
may be responsible for the recurrence of disease (8–10).
Because pre-existing resistant subpopulations, such as cancer
stem cells, have not yet been fully ascertained in osteosarcoma,
elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying such

therapy-induced alterations in cancer will be important for
the development of new treatments.
We recently developed a mouse model of osteosarcoma
based on the overexpression of c-MYC in bone marrow
stromal cells derived from Ink4a/Arf knockout mice. Injection of highly tumorigenic cells (designated AXT cells) into
syngeneic mice results in the development of lethal osteosarcoma with metastatic lesions that mimics human osteoblastic osteosarcoma (11). We previously showed that
cellular heterogeneity as well as therapeutic resistance in
this model can be brought about by soluble factors released
from the tumor microenvironment (12).
In the present study, we identiﬁed IGF2 as a soluble factor
whose gene was expressed at an increased level in osteosarcoma tumors after chemotherapy. Despite its function as a
growth factor, IGF2 ensured cell survival with arresting cell
cycle and conferred a drug-tolerant state in osteosarcoma
cells. These effects of IGF2 were mimicked by insulin. Our
ﬁndings implicate IGF2 and possibly insulin signaling in the
therapeutic resistance of osteosarcoma.

Materials and Methods
Human osteosarcoma samples
Osteosarcoma tissues were obtained from each patient at
the time of biopsy (T1) and surgical resection after neoadjvant
chemotherapy (T2). All patients received basically same chemotherapy, and all samples were approved for analysis by the
ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University
(Kyoto, Japan). Characteristics of each patient in detail are
described in Table 1.
Cell culture
AXT cells and human SAOS2 and U2OS (ATCC) were maintained in IMDM (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10%
FBS. For continuous exposure to mouse or human IGF2 (R&D
Systems) or human insulin (Sigma-Aldrich), cells were incubated overnight in serum-containing medium, washed with
serum-free medium, and cultured in DMEM containing high
glucose supplemented with 2 mmol/L GlutaMAX (Life Technologies) and either 50 ng/mL IGF2 or 50 nmol/L insulin.
Medium was replaced 3 times a week, and the cells were
subjected to analyses at 12 hours after a medium change unless
indicated otherwise.
Cell proliferation assay
Cell viability was measured with Cell Titer-Glo Assay kit
(Promega). The detailed experimental scheme is shown in
Supplementary Materials and Methods and Supplementary
Fig. S1D.
Tumor xenograft model
All animal care and procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines of Hoshi University (Tokyo, Japan)
and Keio University. For establishment of tumor xenografts,
AXT cells (1  106) were suspended in PBS and injected
subcutaneously into 8-week-old female C57BL/6 mice (SLC)
on day 0. The schedule of administration of drugs is described
in Supplementary Materials and Methods.

Reverse transcription-PCR
For patient samples, total RNA was isolated using RNeasy
Mini Kit (QIAGEN) and treated with a DNase-one kit (QIAGEN) to remove gDNA. Reverse transcriptase (RT) reaction
was performed using 1 to 2 mg of total RNA with the
SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Realtime PCR was performed in triplicate using SYBR Green
reagent (Applied Biosystems). cDNA from human liver was
obtained from Human MTC PanelI (Clontech). HOS cells
were obtained from ATCC. The abundance of target mRNAs
was determined relative to that of ACTB mRNA. For mouse
samples, total RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and
real-time PCR analysis was performed as described previously (12). Sets of primers for real-time PCR are listed in
Supplementary Table S1.
RNAi
AXT cells were subjected to reverse transfection for 24 hours
under serum-containing IMDM with Silencer Select siRNAs for
Atg7 (s92536 or s92538; siRNAs 1 and 2, respectively) or with a
control siRNA (Life Technologies), each at a concentration of
50 nmol/L. The detailed experimental scheme is shown in
Supplementary Materials and Methods and Supplementary
Fig. S1E.
Flow cytometry
Cells were ﬁxed for 1 day with ice-cold 70% ethanol,
washed with PBS, and incubated for 1 hour on ice with
Alexa Fluor 647–conjugated Ki67 antibody (Cell Signaling
Technology). Then, cells were washed and suspended in PBS
containing propidium iodide at 10 mg/mL and RNase A
(Sigma-Aldrich). DNA damage was evaluated using Alexa
Fluor 647–conjugated gH2AX antibody and an isotype control antibody according to the manufacturer's instructions
(Cell Signaling Technology). At least 10,000 live cells were
analyzed by FACS Verse (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star).
Time lapse imaging
AXT cells were cultured either in serum- or IGF2-containing medium for 1 or 8 days before analysis, respectively. Cells incubated in the IGF2-containing medium
were also exposed to serum beginning at 17.75 hours after
the onset of analysis. Images were obtained as previously
described (13).
Immunoblot analysis
Cells were lysed with Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad). For
preparation of a tumor homogenate, small fragments were
suspended in the same buffer and disrupted using Biomasher
(Nippi) and ultrasonic treatment. Immunoblot analysis was
performed as previously described (11, 12). Actin or a-tubulin
was examined as a loading control.
Transmission electron microscopy
Sample preparation and acquisition of images was performed as described elsewhere (14).

IGF/Insulin Signaling Induces Dormancy in Osteosarcoma

Immunostaining
Immunohistochemical analysis was performed as previously described (11, 12) using antibodies to GFP (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) and LC3 (MBL). For immunoﬂuorescent
staining, cells were ﬁxed with ice-cold acetone for 5 minutes
for Ki67 and phospho-histone H2AX or 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes for phospho-histone H3, respectively,
washed 3 times with PBS, exposed to PBS containing 3% BSA
for 1 hour, and stained with antibodies to Ki67, phosphohistone H2AX, or phospho-histone H3 (Cell Signaling
Technology). Alexa Fluor 488, 555, or 594–conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Life Technologies.
Nuclei were stained with TOTO3 (Life Technologies) or
40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories).
Stained cells were observed with a confocal microscope
(LSM510; Zeiss) or a ﬂuorescence microscope.
Measurement of the activity of Gst
Gst activity was measured by Gst activity assay kit (Abcam).
Values were divided by each cell number and the activity per
cell was calculated.
Statistical analysis
All assays were performed at least in triplicate and data are
presented as means  SD and analyzed by the Student t test
unless indicated otherwise.

Results
IGF2 ensures survival of osteosarcoma cells in the
absence of serum
Environmental soluble factors are known to alter the
characteristics of cells. To clarify the mechanisms underlying emergence of chemoresistance of osteosarcoma, the
expression of various soluble factors was examined. After
exclusion of highly expressed molecules without the treatment of chemotherapeutic agents, which were previously
described (12), we found IGF2 as one of the candidates
whose mRNA abundance was originally low but signiﬁcantly upregulated after chemotherapy. The amount of Igf1
mRNA was unaffected (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig.
S1A). This effect was even more pronounced in tumor
cells sorted by GFP, which was overexpressed in AXT cells
but not observed in GFP-negative nontumor cells. Serum
IGF2 level was signiﬁcantly increased in tumor-bearing
mice and further slight increase was induced by chemotherapy (Supplementary Fig. S1B). On the basis of these
ﬁndings, we investigated the role of IGF2 in osteosarcoma
cells.
We ﬁrst examined the effect of IGF2 on cell proliferation. IGF2 slightly stimulated proliferation in the presence of
serum (Fig. 1B). Whereas withdrawal of serum results in cellcycle arrest followed by cell death, the addition of IGF2 was
found to support AXT cell survival after serum withdrawal.
Mitotic cells were scarcely observed in AXT cells cultured in
the presence of IGF2 (Fig. 1C). Insulin and IGF1 share downstream signaling pathways with IGF2 (15), and they also
supported the survival of AXT cells after serum withdrawal

www.aacrjournals.org

(Fig. 1D, data not shown). In contrast, FGF2 had no such
effect. The human osteosarcoma cell lines SAOS2 and U2OS
survived in the absence of serum to a greater extent than did
AXT cells. Although mitotic cells or many surviving cells were
detected even under serum-free condition for 3 or 10 days,
respectively, in U2OS cells (Supplementary Fig. S1C); therefore, the effect of IGF2 was undervalued, the survival of both
human cells was also signiﬁcantly enhanced by the presence
of IGF2 (Fig. 1E). These ﬁndings indicated that IGF2 and
insulin ensure osteosarcoma cell survival under serum-free
conditions.
Dormancy-like state induced by long-term exposure to
IGF2 or insulin
All AXT cells were dead under serum-free condition
within 10 days, whereas ﬂow cytometric analysis of live cells
revealed that the G0–G1 fraction and the proportion of Ki67negative (nonproliferating) cells was signiﬁcantly increased,
whereas the S and G2–M fractions were signiﬁcantly
decreased for AXT cells maintained in IGF2-containing
medium compared with those maintained in serum-containing medium (Fig. 2A and B and Supplementary Fig. S2A–
S2C). AXT cells that had been arrested in IGF2 medium reentered the cell cycle 24 hours after exposure to serum.
Similar cell-cycle arrest and downregulation of Ki67 expression were apparent both in AXT cells exposed to insulin and
in SAOS2 cells exposed to IGF2 (Fig. 2C and D and Supplementary Fig. S2D–S2F).
To clarify the effect of IGF2 on cell cycle at the single-cell
level, we performed time-lapse video microscopy. AXT cells
cultured in serum-containing medium proliferated rapidly
to achieve conﬂuence within 1 day with a doubling time of
462  30.3 min (n ¼ 5; Fig. 2E). In contrast, most cells
cultured in the presence of IGF2 had not entered mitosis
during observation for up to 19 hours, although some cells
entered the cell cycle. The arrested cells progressed into
mitosis after subsequent exposure to serum (Fig. 2E and
Supplementary Movie S1). The abundance of cyclins was
downregulated in the IGF2-treated cells; however, this
downregulation was reversed on exposure of the cell to
serum (Fig. 2F). The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib also
partially restored cyclin levels in IGF2-treated cells (Supplementary Fig. S2G), suggesting the involvement of proteasome-mediated degradation. Similar to IGF2, insulin mediated the reversible downregulation of cyclin expression in
AXT cells. Together, these ﬁndings suggested that continuous exposure to IGF2 or insulin in the absence of serum
maintains survival under dormancy-like state of osteosarcoma cells.
Long-term exposure leads to attenuation of
responsiveness to IGF2 in AXT cells
To gain insight into the mechanism underlying the
dormancy-like state, we examined signaling downstream
of the IGF1 receptor (IGF1R). Binding of ligands to IGF1R
triggers activation of signaling by the PI3K–Akt pathway
(15). Removal of serum resulted in the dephosphorylation
of Akt as well as of p70S6K and S6 in 2 hours (Fig. 3A).

Exposure of the serum-deprived cells to IGF2 induced a
transient increase in the phosphorylation levels of these
proteins, which had started to decline by 3 hours. To determine whether the transient nature of these effects of IGF2
was due to a loss of activity, we refreshed the IGF2-containing medium for the ﬁnal 30 minutes of each incubation.
However, such replenishment of IGF2 did not restore the
phosphorylation levels of Akt and, more clearly, p70S6K and
S6 at 12 hours (Fig. 3A). This attenuation of responsiveness

was also apparent in cells cultured for 3 days under the
presence of IGF2 (Fig. 3B). These cells fully responded to
IGF2 24 hours after the ﬁnal supplement of IGF2. However,
this activation was rapidly downregulated and subsequent
replenishment could not lead to the same level of activation
of p70S6K and S6 as the initial response (Fig. 3B). Notably,
downregulation of signaling apparent in cells cultured in
the presence of IGF2 or insulin for 7 days was fully reversed
by exposure of the cells to serum (Fig. 3C). We obtained

similar results with the human osteosarcoma cell lines
SAOS2 and U2OS (Fig. 3D and E). A low level of signal
activation was still apparent in AXT cells exposed to IGF2
or insulin for 7 days. Inhibition of Akt activity resulted in the
decrease of cell viability to a greater extent than in the
presence of serum, suggesting that this low level of activation is critical to support cell survival (Supplementary
Fig. S3A). IGF1R appeared to be constitutively activated in
AXT cells cultured in the presence of IGF2 (Supplementary
Fig. S3B). These ﬁndings suggested that the dormancy-like
state elicited by continuous exposure of osteosarcoma cells
to IGF2 is partially attributable to downregulation of survival signaling caused by attenuation of responsiveness of
IGF1R signaling pathways to IGF2.

Dormancy-like state confers resistance to anticancer
drugs
Given that slowly cycling cells are resistant to anticancer
agents (16), we examined whether the dormancy-like state
alters the sensitivity of osteosarcoma cells to such agents.
Whereas exposure of AXT cells to IGF2 in the presence of
serum did not affect the sensitivity of the cells to adriamycin, that in the absence of serum reduced the sensitivity
compared with that apparent in the presence of serum
(Fig. 4A and B). The same reduction of sensitivity could
also be observed concerning cisplatin and methotrexate.
Treatment of AXT cells with insulin conferred a similar level
of drug resistance (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. S4A and
S4B). Similar results were also obtained with the human

replacement. Cells were also subjected to medium replenishment at 3, 6, and 12 hours and incubation for 1 hour before protein collection. C, AXT
cells were either cultured with IGF2 or insulin (Ins) for 7 days or exposed to IGF2 or insulin for 6 days and then incubated with serum for 1 day. D, SAOS2 or
U2OS cells were either maintained in serum-containing medium or deprived of serum for 3 hours and then exposed to IGF2 for the indicated times. E, SAOS2 or
U2OS cells were either cultured with IGF2 for 10 or 6 days, respectively, or exposed to IGF2 for 9 or 5 days and then incubated with serum for 1 day.

osteosarcoma cell lines SAOS2 and U2OS exposed to IGF2
(Fig. 4D).
To elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the reduced
sensitivity, we examined the amount of phosphorylated histone H2AX (gH2AX), a marker of DNA damage (17, 18). The
proportion of AXT cells found to be highly positive for gH2AX
increased to 65.7% and 52.4% after treatment with adriamycin
or cisplatin, respectively, in serum-containing medium. In
contrast, the corresponding values for cells cultured in the
presence of IGF2 were only 38.6% and 31.5%, respectively.
Conversely, the proportion of gH2AX-negative cells was higher
for AXT cells cultured with IGF2 than for those cultured with
serum (Fig. 4E and Supplementary Fig. S4C and S4D). In
addition, we found signiﬁcant upregulation of Gsts and their
enzymatic activity (Fig. 4F and G), suggesting that detoxication
process is enhanced under IGF2-mediated dormancy-like state
compared with in the presence of serum (19).
These ﬁndings suggested that the dormancy-like state of
osteosarcoma cells by long-term exposure to IGF2 renders the

cells resistant to cytotoxicity induced by chemotherapeutic
drugs.
Survival in IGF2 medium is dependent on glutamine and
autophagy
To gain further insight into the mechanism underlying the
dormancy-like state, we examined the effects of various agents.
Consequently, those related to glutamine metabolism or
autophagy showed similar or greater cytotoxic effects on AXT
cells cultured in the presence of IGF2 or insulin than on those
maintained in the presence of serum (Fig. 5A and B and
Supplementary Fig. S5), implicating these processes in the
dormancy-like state. Depletion of glutamine from IGF2- or
insulin-containing medium resulted in total suppression of
AXT cell survival (Fig. 5C).
The conversion of LC3I to LC3II is indicative of an increase in
autophagy ﬂux (20, 21). The accumulation of LC3II in AXT cells
cultured in the presence of serum suggests the constitutive
activation of autophagy. The ratio of LC3II to LC3I appeared

even greater in AXT cells maintained in IGF2-containing medium than in those cultured in the presence of serum (Fig. 5D),
suggestive of a more pronounced increase in autophagy ﬂux.
Treatment of chloroquine resulted in the accumulation of LC3II
by blocking autophagy in its ﬁnal step (22). Electron microscopy
revealed the presence of a greater number of vacuoles, including
autophagosomes with a double-membrane structure, in the
cytoplasm of AXT cells cultured with IGF2 compared with those
maintained in the presence of serum (Fig. 5E). Consistent with
these ﬁndings, knockdown of Atg7, an E1-like enzyme required
for autophagy (21, 23), not only reduced the abundance of LC3II
(suggestive of inhibition of autophagy; Fig. 5F) but also attenuated the viability of AXT cells maintained in the presence of
IGF2 or insulin (Fig. 5G and H). Thus, the maintenance of
osteosarcoma cell survival by IGF2 or insulin appears to be
dependent on enhancement of autophagy.
Suppression of autophagy and depletion of glutamine
enhance the antitumor activity of chemotherapeutic
agents in vivo
We investigated whether the suppression of autophagy ﬂux
or depletion of glutamine might have an antitumor effect in
vivo. Chloroquine, baﬁlomycin A, or L-asparaginase enhanced
the antitumor activity of the combination of adriamycin, ifos-

famide, and methotrexate (Fig. 6A). Treatment with L-asparaginase, which hydrolyzes asparagine and glutamine to produce
aspartate and glutamate, respectively (24), reduced the serum
concentration of glutamine and increased those of glutamate
and aspartate (Supplementary Fig. S6A). The chemotherapeutic
drugs alone increased the expression of LC3 in some tumors
(Fig. 6B and C), suggesting that autophagy ﬂux could be
increased by chemotherapy. Additional treatment with chloroquine or baﬁlomycin A had a more pronounced effect on LC3
accumulation in tumors than in chemotherapy alone (Fig. 6B
and C), likely reﬂecting the effective inhibition of autophagy
(22). Combined treatment with chemotherapy and these agents
not only resulted in a reduction in tumor size but also induced
severe damage to osteosarcoma cells and a consequent loss of
solidity within tumors compared with the effects of chemotherapy alone (Fig. 6C and Supplementary Fig. S6B). Collectively, these ﬁndings suggested that a combination of agents
targeted to the dormancy-like cells and conventional chemotherapy is a potential therapeutic option for osteosarcoma.
Increased expression levels of IGFs after chemotherapy
in human osteosarcoma
We ﬁnally analyzed seven paired pre- and postchemotherapy human osteosarcoma samples to examine the correlation

between the expression levels of IGFs and chemotherapy (Fig.
6D and Table 1). IGF1 expression tends to be upregulated after
chemotherapy in all tumor samples. In contrast, IGF2 expression basically varied between samples and both downregulation and upregulation were observed after chemotherapy.
However, notably, in OS-1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 with favorable
prognosis, IGF2 level was decreased after chemotherapy, otherwise the cases (OS-3, 7) did not achieve successful clinical
course. In addition, a case (OS-7) whose expression level of
IGF2 was markedly upregulated after chemotherapy exhibited
poor response to chemotherapy.

Discussion
We have here shown that the expression level of Igf2 was
elevated in osteosarcoma cells damaged by chemotherapy.
Although serum-free condition induced cell death, presence
of IGF2 or insulin could guarantee survival of AXT cells, which,
consequently, caused dormancy-like state, as evidenced by
reduced expression of Ki67, downregulation of cyclins, and

decreased activation level of survival signaling. Importantly,
subsequent exposure to serum released the cells from the
dormancy-like state.
Components of the microenvironment have increasingly
been implicated in the maintenance of normal tissue stem
cells in a dormant state (25, 26). AXT cells were established
from bone marrow stromal cells of Ink4a/Arf knockout mice
and harbor a mutant form (R267C) of p53 (data not shown).
Although the stress-activated protein kinase p38 or changes in
the activity of related signaling molecules have been suggested
to regulate quiescence in cancer cells (27, 28), the mechanisms
underlying the induction of quiescence in the cells whose
machinery for arresting cell cycle is almost impaired like AXT
remain to be elucidated.
Growth factor signaling networks incorporate negative
feedback system to maintain homeostasis (29). Previous
reports suggest that activation of the IGF/insulin signaling
is limited by feedback inhibition, which is mediated by the
PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway. Activated S6K phosphorylates
IRS proteins, which induces degradation of IRS proteins,

reduction of their interaction with IGF1R and insulin receptor, or the inhibition of their downstream signaling. Negative
feedback from downstream effectors has also been implicated in the insulin resistance that results in impaired
glucose tolerance in diabetes (30–32). Similar negative feedback might contribute to the dormant osteosarcoma cells
under continuous exposure to IGF2 or insulin. The constitutive activation of IGF1R in AXT cells exposed to IGF2
might partially support this notion.
A very recent report suggests the direct implication of
IGF2 in the emergence of therapeutic resistance in cancer
(33). Overexpression of IGFs and IGFRs is commonly
observed in human osteosarcoma and is implicated in
disease pathogenesis (34–37). Because of the difﬁculty in
obtaining sufﬁcient numbers of pre- and postchemotherapy
human samples, we have not reached deﬁnite conclusion.
However, analysis of seven paired specimens suggests the
possibility that IGF signaling can modulate therapeutic
sensitivity in human osteosarcoma. Activation of IGF signaling in regions that are separated from the vasculature
might allow the survival of stressed tumor cells until resuming proliferation after "angiogenic switch" (38). Such "niches"
or "hotbeds" of surviving tumor cells might thus engender
minimal residual disease (Supplementary Fig. S6C).
The survival of osteosarcoma cells supported by IGF2 or
insulin was found to be dependent on enhanced autophagy
ﬂux and glutamine availability. Both intra- and extracellular
increased glutamine levels were suggested to be linked to
upregulation of autophagy ﬂux and protection from cell
death (39, 40). Quiescent hematopoietic stem cells have also
been suggested to be dependent on autophagy ﬂux for their
survival (41, 42). In addition, inhibition of metabolic
processes or autophagy ﬂux in quiescent ﬁbroblasts or
therapy-induced senescent lymphoma cells resulted in cell
death (43, 44). Therefore, intracellular events underlying
IGF2- or insulin-mediated dormancy in osteosarcoma cells

might be common to quiescence induced in other cell types
by other stimuli. Targeting of IGF- or insulin-mediated
dormant cancer cells combined with conventional therapies
might thus provide a ﬁrmer basis for the development of
new options to overcome therapeutic resistance in individuals with osteosarcoma.
