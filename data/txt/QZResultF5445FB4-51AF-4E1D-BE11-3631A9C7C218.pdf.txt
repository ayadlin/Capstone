ABSTRACT
Compelling epidemiologic evidence indicates that obesity is associated with a high
risk of human malignancies, including thyroid cancer. We previously demonstrated
that a high fat diet (HFD) effectively induces the obese phenotype in a mouse model
of aggressive follicular thyroid cancer (ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice). We showed that HFD
promotes cancer progression through aberrant activation of the leptin-JAK2-STAT3
signaling pathway. HFD-promoted thyroid cancer progression allowed us to test other
molecular targets for therapeutic opportunity for obesity-induced thyroid cancer.
Metformin is a widely used drug to treat patients with type II diabetes. It has been
shown to reduce incidences of neoplastic diseases and cancer mortality in type II
diabetes patients. The present study aimed to test whether metformin could be a
therapeutic for obesity-activated thyroid cancer. ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice were fed HFD
together with metformin or vehicle-only, as controls, for 20 weeks. While HFDThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice had shorter survival than LFD-treated mice, metformin had no
effects on the survival of HFD-ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice. Remarkably, metformin markedly
decreased occurrence of capsular invasion and completely blocked vascular invasion
and anaplasia in HFD-ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice without affecting thyroid tumor growth.
The impeded cancer progression was due to the inhibitory effect of metformin on
STAT3-ERK-vimentin and fibronectin-integrin signaling to decrease tumor cell
invasion and de-differentiation. The present studies provide additional molecular
evidence to support the link between obesity and thyroid cancer risk. Importantly,
our findings suggest that metformin could be used as an adjuvant in combination
with antiproliferative modalities to improve the outcome of patients with obesityactivated thyroid cancer.

such as increased tumor size, extrathyroidal invasion,
and advanced tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) stage
independent of age, sex, and other confounding factors
[7]. These compelling epidemiologic data on the positive
correlation of obesity with the risk of thyroid cancer
prompted us to explore the molecular basis underpinning
such a correlation.
We used a mouse model of follicular thyroid
cancer (ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice) to elucidate the underlying
mechanisms. ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice express a potent
dominantly negative thyroid hormone receptor β (TRβPV)

INTRODUCTION
The incidence of thyroid cancer, the most common
malignancy in endocrine organs, has been increasing
rapidly in the past decades [1, 2]. At the same time, the
rates of obesity and metabolic syndrome have also risen.
Recent epidemiologic studies have shown a positive
association of obesity with thyroid cancer incidence [3–
6]. Many retrospective studies of patients with papillary
thyroid cancer (PTC) show that a higher body mass index
is correlated with a more aggressive PTC phenotype,

These results suggest that metformin could be beneficial
for patients with obesity-activated thyroid cancer.

and haplo insufficiency in the Pten gene (phosphatase and
tensin homologue deleted from chromosome 10) [8]. We
fed ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice a high fat diet (HFD) to induce
obesity marked by increased body weight, enlarged fat
cells, and elevated serum leptin levels [9]. Biochemical
and histopathologic analyses showed that the obese ThrbPV/
PV
Pten+/−mice exhibit more aggressive tumor progression
with increased tumor cell proliferation, shortened survival,
and frequent occurrence of anaplasia [9]. Moreover, we
also identified leptin-JAK2-STAT3 signaling as one
pathway that mediates the obesity-induced aggressive
tumor progression. Thus, these findings not only provide
direct molecular evidence to support the link between
obesity and thyroid cancer risk, but also open the
possibility of using ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice to test potential
molecular targets for treatment of obesity-induced thyroid
cancer.
More recently, we treated ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice with
a STAT3-specific inhibitor, S3I-201, aiming to block the
STAT3-downstream signaling to delay obesity-exacerbated
thyroid cancer progression [10]. We found that S3I-201
effectively inhibits HFD-induced aberrant activation of
STAT3 and its downstream targets to markedly inhibit
thyroid tumor growth and prolong survival. S3I-201 also
acts to decrease expression of the key regulators of the
epithelial-mesenchymal-transition, i.e., vimentin and
matrix metallo proteinases, to block anaplasia and lung
metastasis [10]. Thus, using HFD-ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice, we
have shown that inhibition of the STAT3 activity would
be a novel treatment strategy for obesity-induced thyroid
cancer.
With the availability of HFD-ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice
as a preclinical mouse model, we expanded the search
for other potential treatment modalities for obesityinduced thyroid cancer. We considered metformin
(1,1-dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride), the most widely
used antihyperglycemic drug for treatment of type II
diabetes patient sowing to its effectiveness, safety profile,
and affordability [11, 12]. In addition to its anti-diabetic
effect, epidemiologic evidence suggests that metformin
may lower cancer risk, increase healthy life span and
improve outcomes among diabetic patients [13–19].
Numerous studies have shown that metformin could
reduce the risk of developing solid tumors [20], such as
colorectal, liver, pancreatic, stomach, breast, and thyroid
cancer [20–24]. Recently, several studies have reported
that metformin inhibits cell proliferation in thyroid cancer
cells including medullary, anaplastic, and PTC cell lines
[20, 25–27]. Still lacking, however, is direct molecular
evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of metformin in
the treatment of obesity-induced thyroid cancer in vivo. In
the present studies, we treated HFD-ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice
with metformin and evaluated its effects on survival, tumor
growth, tumor cell invasion, and occurrence of anaplasia.
We found that metformin markedly decreased occurrence
of capsular invasion and completely blocked vascular

RESULTS
Metformin delays thyroid tumor progression in
ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice with HFD-induced obesity
Previously, we reported that the diet-induced obesity
in ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice promoted thyroid carcinogenesis
by reducing survival rate, increasing tumor growth, and
advancing tumor stages [9]. To evaluate the effect of
metformin on obesity-activated thyroid carcinogenesis,
we analyzed survival, body weight, and thyroid weight in
low fat diet (LFD)- or HFD-ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice. Figure
1A-a shows that the survival of HFD-ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice
was significantly shorter than LFD-ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice.
However, metformin had no apparent effect on the
survival of LFD-ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice (Figure 1A-b) or
HFD-ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice (Figure 1A-c). Consistent with
our previous findings [9], the body weight of HFD-ThrbPV/
PV
Pten+/−mice was significantly higher than LFD-ThrbPV/
PV
Pten+/−mice (Figure 1B-a, data set 1 vs data set 3, n=711). However, metformin had no significant effect on
the body weight of LFD- and HFD-ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice
(Figure 1B-a). We next evaluated the effect of metformin
on thyroid tumor growth. As reported previously [9], the
thyroid weight of HFD-ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice was clearly
higher than LFD-ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice (Figure 1B-b,data
set 1 vs data set 3, n=7-11). However, metformin had no
significant effect on the thyroid tumor growth of LFDThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice (Figure 1B-b, data set 1 vs data set
2, n=11-13), and HFD-ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice (Figure 1B-b,
data set 4 vs data set 3, n=6-7).
We further evaluated the effect of metformin on
thyroid tumor progression by comparing histopathologic
characteristics of ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice with different
treatments at the same age. Consistent with our previous
observations, HFD promoted tumor progression from
extensive hyperplasia (Figure 2A, panel a) and early
vascular invasion (panel b) in the thyroid of LFD-ThrbPV/
PV
Pten+/−mice to the more advanced stages of vascular
invasion (panel e) and anaplasia (panel f). The frequency
of occurrence of such pathologic changes promoted by
HFD is clearly shown in Figure 2B (see open bar 1 versus
bar 3 in panels a, b, and c). It is important to note that
treatment of LFD-ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice with metformin
reverted tumor progression from vascular invasion (Figure
2A, panel b) to hyperplasia (panel d). More impressively,
metformin markedly reverted the tumor phenotypes from
vascular invasion (Figure 2A, panel e) and anaplasia
(panel f) to hyperplasia (panels g and h) in HFD-ThrbPV/
PV
Pten+/−mice. The beneficial effects of metformin on the
pathological changes are clearly evident in Figure 2B in
that no occurrences of vascular invasion and anaplasia

were detected in HFD-ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice treated with
metformin (compare bar 4 with bar 3 in panels b and
c). These results indicate that metformin treatment was
effective in blocking tumor progression.

HFD-induced tumor progression, we first evaluated the
changes brought about by metformin in the key regulators
of the Leptin-JAK2-STAT3 signaling. As shown in Figure
3A-I, metform in lowered p-STAT3 (Y705) protein levels
in thyroid tumors of HFD-ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice (compare
lanes 10-12 to lanes 4-6) without changing the total STAT3
protein levels (panel b). The quantitative analysis of the
ratios of p-STAT3 (Y705) versus total STAT3 indicated
that the HFD-induced activation of STAT3 signaling
(Figure 3A-II, bar 3) was attenuated by metformin (Figure
3A-II, bar 4). We further carried out immunohistochemical
analysis to determine the protein abundance of p-STAT3

Metformin inhibits the STAT3 signaling pathway

Previously, we elucidated that the activation of
leptin-JAK2-STAT3 signaling accounts for the HFDinduced promotion of thyroid tumor progression in ThrbPV/

(Y705) in thyroid tumor cells in ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice.
Consistent with the results from western blot analysis,
metformin didnot affect the protein levels of p-STAT3
in the tumor cells of LFD-ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice (Figure
3B-I, panel d versus panel b; also see the quantitative
data: Figure 3B-II, bar 2 versus bar 1). In contrast,
p-STAT3 signals clearly had higher intensity in vehicletreated HFD-ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice than in LFD-ThrbPV/
PV
Pten+/−mice (Figure 3B-I, compare panel f with panel
b; Figure 3B-II, bar 3 versus bar 1). Metformin treatment
reduced the p-STAT3 signals in thyroid tumor cells of
HFD-ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice (Figure 3B-I, compare panel h
with panel f; also see the quantitative data: Figure 3B-II,
bar 2 versus bar 1). Taken together, these data indicate that
metformin acted to inhibit the activation of STAT3.

Leptin mediates its effects not only via STAT3, but
also via extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) [28].
We therefore evaluated the activity of ERK by examining
p-ERK protein levels. HFD elevated p-ERK (T202/204)
without significant changes in total ERK protein levels
(Figure 4A-I-a and 4A-I-b, lanes 4-6 versus lanes 1-3;
also see the quantitative data: Figure 4A-II-a, bar 3 versus
bar 1). Metformin treatment reduced p-ERK protein levels
(Figure 4A-I, lanes 10-12 versus lanes 4-6; also see the
quantitative data: Figure 4A-II-a, bar 4 versus bar 3).
Therefore, leptin-mediated activation of STAT3 and ERK
pathways was attenuated by metformin.
Since metformin blocked thyroid tumor progression
of HFD-ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice, we next focused on the
analysis of regulators affecting cytoskeletal structure,

cell motility, and migration. We first examined whether
vimentin protein levels were affected by metformin.
Vimentin is a type III intermediate filament protein and
is a major cytoskeletal component in mesenchymal cells.
Vimentin is often used as a marker for cells undergoing
epithelial-mesenchymal-transition
(EMT)
during
metastatic progression. Vimentin is positively regulated
by STAT3 [29, 30]. Moreover, biochemical analyses
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

demonstrated direct interaction of vimentin with ERK,
which promoted ERK activation and enhanced vimentin
transcription [31, 32]. In line with these findings, we
found that elevated vimentin in thyroid tumors of HFDThrbPV/PVPten+/− mice was inhibited by metformin, thereby
decreasing the extent of EMT (Figure 4A-I, panel c, lanes
10-12 versus lanes 4-6; also quantitative data: Figure
4A-II-b, bar 4 versus bar 3) to suppress cell invasion.

We next evaluated whether extracellular matrix
components were affected by metformin in thyroid tumor
cells of HFD-ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice. Fibronectin (FN) is a
high molecular weight protein of the extracellular matrix
that binds to membrane-spanning receptor proteins, known

as integrins. FN plays a major role in cell adhesion,
migration, and metastasis [33, 34]. Recent studies
suggest that metformin treatment could reduce tumor cell
invasion in pancreatic cancer [35]. Metformin treatment
of diabetetic patients is associated with low recurrence of

cervical lymph node metastasis of differentiated thyroid
cancer [36]. Indeed, we found that FN protein abundance
was higher in thyroid tumors of HFD-ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice
than in LFD-ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice (Figure 4B-I, panel a,
lanes 4-6 versus lanes 1-3; quantitative data: Figure
4B-II-a, bar 3 versus bar 1). Metformin treatment lowered
FN protein abundance in thyroid tumor cells of HFDThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice (Figure 4B-I, panel a, lanes 10-12
versus lanes 4-6; quantitative data: Figure 4B-II-a, bar 4
versus 2).
Increased integrin expression levels contribute
to earlier metastatic potential of thyroid cancer [37].
For example, integrin α6 has been reported to mediate
progression of papillary thyroid cancer [38]. Therefore,
we further evaluated the protein levels of FN receptors
such as integrins α6, β1, and β3 in thyroid tumors of LFDor HFD-ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice. We found that integrin α6
(Figure 4B-I, panel b), integrin β1 (panel c), and integrin
β3 (panel d) were similarly elevated as FN in the thyroid
tumors of HFD-ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice (Figure 4B-I, lanes
4-6 versus lanes 1-3; quantitative data: Figure 4B-II-b,
4B-II-c, and 4B-II-d, bar 3 versus bar 1). Metformin
similarly suppressed the protein levels of integrin α6
(panel b), integrin β1 (panel c), and integrin β3 (panel d)
(Figure 4B-I, lanes 10-12 versus lanes 4-6; quantitative
data: Figure 4B-II-b, 4B-II-c, and 4B-II-d, bar 3 versus bar
1). Taken together, these results indicate that metformin
treatment was effective in attenuating HFD-activated
EMT and the FN-integrin signaling pathway to suppress
invasion and anaplasia of tumor cells in HFD-ThrbPV/
PV
Pten+/−mice.

there were additional pathways affected by metformin that
could reduce the tumor cells invasion. The identification of
such pathways would await future studies.
The findings that metformin blocked vascular
invasion of thyroid tumors of ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice are
in line with the reports in which the anti-angiogenic
effects of metformin were described in colon cancer
[39], HER2+ tumor cells [40] and breast tumors [41,
42]. In colon cancer, metformin was shown to down
regulate tumor angiogenesis and augment the antitumor
effect oxaliplatin [39]. In HER2+ tumor cells, metformin
treatment decreased microvessel-induced inhibition of
tumor angiogenesis [40]. In breast tumors, metformin
reduced tumor microvessel density and attenuated tumor
angiogenesis [41, 42]. While metformin was shown to
have anti-neoplastic effects in diabetic patients with
differentiated thyroid cancer [25], whether metformin
has anti-angiogenic effects in thyroid cancer progression
remains to be elucidated.
That metformin could block cancer cell invasion
and anaplasia, but not tumor growth, suggested that
the molecular pathways of anti-diabetic and anticancer
actions of metformin could differ in vivo. Although the
detailed molecular basis underlying the metabolic effects
of metformin are not completely understood, the primary
molecular mechanism mediating this effect appears
to be the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase
(AMPK) and the subsequent inhibition of mammalian
targets of rapamycin (mTOR) [43–45]. Intriguingly, no
significant changes in the AMPK-mTOR-p70S6K and
AMPK-mTOR-4EBP1 signaling pathways were detected
in thyroid tumors of HFD-ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice (data not
shown). These results suggest that metformin treatment
had not led to the changes of protein synthesis and lipid
metabolism during thyroid carcinogenesis of HFD-ThrbPV/
PV
Pten+/−mice as expected for its anti-diabetic effects. This
notion is consistent with our findings that metformin
treatment did not affect tumor growth (Figure 1B-b).
We have shown previously that in the thyroid of ThrbPV/
PV
Pten+/−mice, PI3K-AKT is highly activated to drive
aggressive tumor growth [8]. Knowing that AKT is also
a downstream target of activated insulin signaling [46],
we speculate that highly activated AKT signaling could
interfere with the AMPK signaling via cross talk such that
the metformin-mediated inhibition of AMPK could be
blunted in the thyroid of HFD-ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice. This
conjecture raises the possibility that the effectiveness of
metformin as an antiproliferative drug would depend on
the genetic abnormalities and altered signaling pathways
of thyroid cancer. That AMPK sensitivity to metformin
inhibition could be modulated by cellular context is not
without precedent. It has been shown that p53 is involved
in mediating the energy-conserving response to AMPK
activation and that loss of p53 heightens the metformininduced energy stress on cancer cells, implying that
metformin may have increased efficacy in p53-deficient

DISCUSSION
In the present studies, we used the preclinical
model of ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice fed with HFD to test the
effect of metformin on obesity-activated thyroid cancer
progression. Treatment of HFD-ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice with
metformin for 20 weeks had no effect on the survival
or the thyroid tumor growth of these mice. Remarkably,
however, the treatment reduced the occurrence of capsular
invasion and abrogated the development of vascular
invasion and anaplasia. Since the endpoint of metformin
treatment was 20 weeks, which did not allow sufficient
time for metastasis to occur, we were unable to evaluate
the effect of metformin on the development of metastasis.
Using molecular and biochemical analyses, we found that
metformin attenuated the activity of STAT3-ERK-vimentin
and FN-integrin signaling to reduce the occurrence of
capsular invasion and blocked vascular invasion and
anaplasia. However, the altered FN-integrin signaling
may not be the only pathway that led to the reduced tumor
cell invasion by metformin. We found that metformin also
suppressed the occurrence of thyroid tumor cell invasion
in LFD-treated ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice, but no changes in the
FN-integrin signaling. These observations suggested that

tumors like ovarian cancer [47]. In addition, recent
studies showed that cancer cell lines with mutations in
mitochondrial DNA genes have an increased response
to metformin [48]. In line with these observations, an
ongoing clinical trial is currently evaluating the effect of
metformin on dosing of levothyroxine (T4) required for
TSH suppression in patients with differentiated thyroid
cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov; Identifier: NCT01341886). The
outcome of this trial should uncover how the sensitivity
of TSH response to T4 is modulated by metformin and
could further support the notion that the effectiveness of
metformin is subject to modulation by cellular regulators.
The present studies showed that metformin failed
to exert antiproliferative effects to inhibit HFD-induced
tumor growth in ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice. Still, metformin
was effective in delaying thyroid cancer progression
by reducing the frequency of capsular invasion and
abrogating the development of vascular invasion and
anaplasia. These findings suggest that metformin would
be useful in preventing the metastatic spread of thyroid
cancer. These findings also suggest that metformin would
be useful as an adjuvant in combination treatment with
other antiproliferative drugs. In view of metformin’s
safety and affordability, we would expect that clinical
trials could soon be extended to test the effectiveness of
metformin to treat differentiated and de-differentiated
thyroid cancer. In addition to ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice, other
mouse models have recently been developed to study
thyroid cancer [49–54], and it would be possible to use
different mouse models mimicking different types of
thyroid cancer to assess the effectiveness of metformin
in those models. Furthermore, these preclinical studies
might also lead to the identification of genes that could
potentially enhance metformin’s effects, as well as genes
that could render metformin insensitive. The findings of
these proposed preclinical studies would be very helpful
in the consideration of using metformin to improve the
outcome of patients with thyroid cancer.

housed in SPF (specific pathogens free) animal facility,
were administrated HFD diet from the age of 6 weeks until
the end of the study. Metformin (cat#M1566, Spectrum,
Gardena, CA, USA) was diluted in drinking water (0.5
mg/ml) [55], and the solution was changed weekly. They
were monitored until they reached the age of 21 weeks, or
they became moribund with rapid weight loss, hunched
posture, and labored breathing. After the mice were
euthanized, the thyroids were dissected for weighing,
histologic analysis, and biochemical studies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Preparation of whole-cell lysates from thyroid
glands has been described previously [50]. The protein
sample (30 μg) was loaded and separated by SDS-PAGE.
After electrophoresis, the protein was electrotransferred
to a poly vinylidenedifluoride membrane (Immobilon-P;
Millipore Corp., Billeria, MA, USA). The antibodies
phosphorylated STAT3 (1:500 dilution), total-STAT3
(1:1,000 dilution), p-ERK (1:500 dilution), total-ERK
(1:1,000 dilution), vimentin (1:1,000 dilution), and
GAPDH (1:1,000 dilution) were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). Antibodies
for fibronectin (1:200 dilution), integrin α6 (1:200
dilution), integrin β1 (1:200 dilution), integrin and
β3 (1:200 dilution) were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Dallas, TX, USA). The blots were stripped
with Re-Blot Plus (Millipore, Billeria, MA, USA) and
reprobed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to GAPDH.

Histopathologic analysis
Thyroid glands, lungs and inguinal fat were
dissected and fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and subsequently
embedded in paraffin. Five-micrometer-thick sections
were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
For each animal, single random sections of thyroid
were examined. For thyroids, morphologic evidence of
hyperplasia, capsular invasion, and vascular invasion was
routinely examined in that single section.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was conducted as
previously described with some modifications [50]. For
the antigen retrieval step, slides were heated in 0.05%
citraconic anhydride solution (pH 7.4; Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA) at 98°C for 60 minutes followed
by treatment with rabbit anti-p-STAT3 antibody (1:100
dilution, Cell Signaling, Denver, MA, USA) and anticleaved caspase 3 antibody (dilution 1:300, cat. 9661,
Cell Signaling) at 4°C overnight. The antigen signals
were detected by treatment with the peroxidase substrate

Mice and treatment
The National Cancer Institute Animal Care and Use
Committee approved the protocols for animal care and
handling in the present study. Mice harboring the ThrbPV
gene (ThrbPV/PVmice) were prepared via homologous
recombination, and genotyping was carried out using the
PCR method, as previously described [8]. Pten+/−mice
were kindly provided by Dr. Ramon Parsons (Columbia
University, NY, USA). ThrbPV/PVPten+/−mice were
obtained by first crossing Pten+/−mice with ThrbPV/PVmice
followed by further crossing the heterozygous offspring
ThrbPV/+Pten+/− with ThrbPV/+Pten+/−mice. The high fat
diet (HFD) (60 % Kcal from fat) was purchased from
Research Diets (New Brunswick, NJ, USA). The mice,
