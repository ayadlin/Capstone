BACKGROUND: Few studies have quantified temporal patterns of cause-specific mortality in contemporary cohorts of men with
early-stage seminoma. Given that several management strategies can be applied in these patients, each resulting in excellent longterm survival, it is important to evaluate associated long-term sequelae. In particular, data describing long-term risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD) are conflicting. METHODS: We identified 9193 men diagnosed with stage I seminoma (ages 15-70 years) in the population-based SEER registries (1973-2001). We calculated survival estimates, standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), and adjusted
hazard rates (AHRs). RESULTS: During 121,037 person-years of follow-up (median, 12.3 years), 915 deaths (SMR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.16-1.32)
were reported, with significant excesses for suicide (n 5 39; SMR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.06-1.98), infection (n 5 58; SMR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.803.00), and second malignant neoplasms (SMNs; n 5 291; SMR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.61-2.03), but not CVD (n 5 201; SMR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.801.05). After radiotherapy (78% patients), CVD deaths were not increased (n 5 158; SMR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.76-1.04), in contrast to SMN
deaths (n 5 246; SMR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.67-2.14). SMN mortality was higher among patients administered radiotherapy than among those
not given radiotherapy (AHR, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.99-1.88; P 5.059), with a cumulative 15-year risk of 2.64% (95% CI, 2.19-3.16). Suicide,
although rare, accounted for 1 in 230 deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Modern radiotherapy as applied in this large population-based study is
not associated with excess CVD mortality. Although increased all-cause mortality exists, cumulative SMN risk is considerably smaller
than reported in historical series, but additional follow-up will be required to characterize long-term trends. The increased risk of suiC 2013 American Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Stage I testicular seminoma is the most common malignancy in American men ages 20-45 years. Adjuvant radiotherapy, single-agent carboplatin, or active surveillance can be applied following standard orchiectomy, with each
approach yielding a 10-year survival rate approaching 100%. Because each management strategy for seminoma
can result in an average gain of at least 40 years of life,1 quantification of the late effects of alternative therapies
is important in terms of clinical decision making. Recent studies2,3 suggest that 50%-80% of US men with stage
I seminoma still receive adjuvant radiotherapy based in part on assumptions that contemporary radiotherapy techniques, which deliver substantially less dose to normal tissues, are not associated with excess second malignant
neoplasms (SMNs), as reported in surveys that included populations treated in the 1940s and 1950s.4,5 Moreover,
the evidence for increased risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD) following modern radiotherapy is conflicting,6 in
contrast to the large, significantly elevated risks observed in older surveys.5,7
The present study was undertaken to quantify nontesticular cancer causes of death and associated temporal patterns
among a large number of men with stage I seminoma in a population-based setting. The study was limited to patients
diagnosed during or after 1973, when high-energy linear accelerators, which reflect modern treatments, were widely used.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Vital status was ascertained through December 31,
2006. We evaluated deaths from testicular cancer and
other medical causes.

Data Sources

The NCI SEER program assembles population-based
data on US cancer incidence,8 also collecting information
on patient demographics, tumor morphology, stage, first
course of treatment, and vital status. This study was
exempt from institutional review board review.

Statistical Analysis

The study cohort was characterized with descriptive statistics. Cumulative incidence of death, time to specific cause
of death,10 and all-cause mortality11 were calculated from
time of seminoma diagnosis. Age- and sex-adjusted standardized mortality ratios (SMRs)12,13 for specific causes of
death were calculated using year 2000 US population
data.14 The SMR for the entire study period was calculated. Cox15,16 and Fine and Gray17 multivariable analyses were used to evaluate the effect of radiotherapy on allcause and cause-specific mortality.
Results are presented as SMRs and adjusted hazard
ratios (AHRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs)
and P values. A 2-sided P < .05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were conducted using SAS
version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and R version
2.12.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,
Austria).

Study Cohort

A total of 9561 men diagnosed with stage I testicular
seminoma (ICD, 3rd edition, histological codes 9060/3
through 9064/3) as a first primary cancer between
January 1, 1973, and December 31, 2001, at ages 1570 years were identified. We excluded patients for
whom tumor stage (n 5 11), race (n 5 62), or radiotherapy was unknown (n 5 199), for whom a radioisotope
was administered (n 5 19), or cause of death was
unknown (n 5 77). The final cohort consisted of
9193 men.
Patients were classified according to tumor (T)
stage, race, and receipt of adjuvant radiotherapy as
initial treatment. The proportion of adults in the
patient’s county of residence with less than a high
school education was selected as the sociodemographic indicator, as used previously.2,9 We classified
education level as low (>25%), intermediate (15%25%), or high (<15% without a high school
education).

RESULTS
Descriptive Characteristics

Of 9193 men, 94% were white, 97% had T1/T2 disease,
and 78% received radiotherapy (Table 1). Men who were
and were not treated with radiotherapy were similar in

97,357 and 23,680 person-years of follow-up, respectively. Patients residing in counties with a low education
level were less likely to receive radiotherapy (P < .001).
Causes of and Risk of Death

After a median follow-up of 12.7 years for men treated
with radiotherapy and 10.9 years for those who were not,
915 men (10.0%) died, resulting in a 15-year overall survival rate of 91.2% (95% CI, 90.5-91.9; Fig. 1). The 5
most common causes of death were SMN (n 5 291), cardiovascular disease (n 5 201), testicular cancer (n 5 73),
infection (n 5 58), and suicide (n 5 39); see Figure 2.
Other medical causes of death with 25 cases were cerebrovascular disease (n 5 27) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; n 5 25). Compared with the ageadjusted general male population, men diagnosed with
stage I seminoma had significantly increased risks of overall
mortality and death due to SMN, infection, and suicide
(Table 2) whether or not they received radiotherapy. Mortality from cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease,
or COPD was similar to that in the general population.
Effect of Radiotherapy on Mortality Outcomes

After adjustment for age at diagnosis, education level,
race, and tumor stage, men who received radiotherapy
Cancer

were less likely to die from any cause (P < .001) and had a
lower risk of mortality from either testicular cancer
(P < .001) or infection (P < .002) than men who had not
received radiotherapy (Table 3). There was no difference
in cardiovascular mortality (P 5 .930) between the 2
groups.
After adjustment for age at diagnosis, education
level, race, and tumor stage, men who received radiotherapy were more likely to die from SMN than those
who had not received radiotherapy (AHR, 1.36; 95% CI
0.99-1.88; P 5 .059). The cumulative risk of death due
to SMN at 15 years was 2.64% (95% CI, 2.19-3.16) in
men who received radiotherapy and 1.77% (95% CI,
1.17-2.59) in those not given radiotherapy. Of 246
deaths from SMN after radiotherapy, 75 (30%) were
due to cancers at sites included in standard infradiaphragmatic fields (ie, stomach, small intestine, colon, rectum, liver, gallbladder and ducts, pancreas, kidney, and
bladder). Mortality due to these tumors was elevated
only among men who received radiotherapy (SMR,
1.79; 95% CI, 1.43-2.25; Table 4). In contrast, significant excesses for cancer sites typically not included in
standard radiation fields were observed among both
men who had (SMR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.52-2.05) and had
not (SMR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.06-2.07) received
radiotherapy.
We also evaluated site-specific patterns of death for
SMN with 25 cases observed. Mortality due to pancreatic cancer was 2.5- to 3.4-fold higher than in the general
population for both men who had (SMR, 3.35; 95% CI,
2.32-4.84) and had not (SMR, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.12-5.92)
received radiotherapy (Table 4). In contrast, the higher

risk of death due to lung cancer was observed only after
radiotherapy (SMR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.07-1.71), with
increases limited to men treated in the 1970s (SMR, 2.22;
95% CI, 1.60-3.07); excess deaths were not evident after
1980 (SMR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.68-1.25).
DISCUSSION
We report for the first time to our knowledge significantly
increased all-cause mortality among US men with stage I
seminoma. Our large population-based study is unique in
that it focused on patients diagnosed after the introduction of linear accelerators into clinical practice. Importantly, no increase in CVD deaths was apparent, although
excess mortality from SMN, suicide, and infection
occurred. Death from testicular cancer was rare.
The extent to which modern radiotherapy for testicular cancer may increase the risk for life-threatening complications, such as CVD and SMN, was recently
2774

identified as key research questions in both a 400-page
national report18 and during an international consensus
conference.19 Although some studies have shown elevated
risks for either CVD incidence7,20 or CVD mortality5 in
testicular cancer survivors compared with the general population, we found no evidence of excess mortality. Zagars
et al5 reported increased risks of CVD death in stage I
seminoma patients given radiotherapy (SMR, 1.63; 95%
CI, 1.08-2.36), but included patients dating to the 1950s
and 1960s. In addition, a higher placement of the superior
borders for subdiaphragmatic radiotherapy fields in this
cohort may have resulted in larger incidental cardiac
doses. Both Wethal et al20 (Norway) and Huddart et al7
(Great Britain) also reported elevated 2-fold risks of CVD
(RR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.04-5.3; and RR, 2.40; 95% CI,
1.04-5.45, respectively) after radiotherapy for seminoma.
Reasons for varying results between European studies and
our US-based survey may be due not only to differences in
the underlying populations, but also to variations in the
distribution of baseline cardiovascular risk factors, including diet, energy balance, and physical activity. Analytic
studies based on large numbers of seminoma patients will
be required to determine the extent to which cardiac doses
from modern subdiaphragmatic radiotherapy may be
associated with CVD.
Prior studies have demonstrated increased suicidal
ideation and increased suicide rates among other cancer
survivors,21 but we show for the first time to our knowledge significant suicide excesses in stage I seminoma,
which persisted for 10 years after diagnosis. This finding
is especially disturbing in view of the otherwise excellent
prognosis for these patients. It is well established that
depression and anxiety exist at the time of testicular cancer
diagnosis.22 Moreover, a survey of 1408 Norwegian testicular cancer survivors found that anxiety disorders
remained significantly increased at a median follow-up of
11.3 years compared with age- and sex-matched controls.23 Depression, anxiety,24 and male sex24 are established risk factors for suicide. However, in a
comprehensive study of suicide among cancer patients,
risks were largest close to the time of diagnosis and associated with poor prognosis, metastatic disease, older age,
and lack of treatment options,25 which are not applicable
for stage I seminoma. In our series, we examined temporal
trends over 2 decades and found significantly increased
risks for 10 years. This finding requires confirmation in
other series. In the interim, in view of the known psychological distress reported among testicular cancer survivors,22,23 clinicians should continue to be attentive to
patients’ psychosocial concerns.

The increase in all-cause mortality that we observed
was driven largely by SMN. However, in contrast to other
studies,4,6,26 our study did not include patients treated in
the 1940s through 1960s, when cobalt or kilovoltage irradiation, which delivers much higher integral doses to normal tissues, was applied. Although we found a marginally
significantly increased risk of SMN mortality in men who
had received radiotherapy compared with men who had
not, the 15-year cumulative risk (2.64%; 95% CI, 2.193.16) was considerably smaller than that reported in other
surveys.5,6,27 Our lower estimates likely reflect the use of
modern radiotherapy techniques, in which smaller fields
and lower doses are used. Based on statistical models,
Zwahlen et al28 estimated that new radiotherapy
approaches for stage I seminoma will result in a 50%-66%
decreased risk of SMN. Our results provide preliminary
support for these statistical predictions.
Our significant 80% excesses in SMN mortality
confirm findings in institutional surveys5,29 and mirror
increases in SMN incidence reported in population-based
studies.4,6 Excess SMN deaths occurred among men who
received radiotherapy and among those who did not.
Explanations for excesses among the latter group include,
first, possible misclassification in the SEER program
because adjuvant radiotherapy is likely underreported.30
Second, cytotoxic drugs, which may be given to treat
relapsed seminoma, have been associated with excess second cancers in other studies.4,6,26 Finally, in any

examination of SMN risk, inherently increased risks associated with the first cancer diagnosis should be
considered.19
Men with lower socioeconomic status were less
likely to receive radiotherapy (P < .001), as reported previously.2 We now also show that patients not given radiotherapy were more likely to die from testicular cancer than
radiotherapy-treated patients. This observation was unexpected in view of the almost negligible risks (<1%) of
seminoma-specific mortality in surveillance studies.31
Thus, a lack of receipt of radiotherapy, the well-established standard of care in the United States during the
study period, may reflect either a lack of access to health
care or low-quality health care, both of which could place
patients at increased mortality. Prior large-scale US surveys of cancer patients have convincingly shown that
lower socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with both
increased numbers of cancer deaths and increased allcause mortality, underscoring the importance of further
study of the effect of health disparities on outcomes. We
also observed that seminoma patients not given radiotherapy were more likely to die of HIV-related illness, with
lower SES also associated with poorer survival in HIVpositive patients in other series.32,33 Although HIVinfected patients experience the same 5-year testicularcancer-specific survival rate as do uninfected patients,34
they demonstrate excess mortality because of HIV-related
illness.35,36
Limitations in our study are those inherent to the
SEER program. Radiotherapy fields and doses, which
may influence the risk of SMN and CVD,37 are not collected by the SEER registries nor is information on the cytotoxic drugs assembled. In the evaluation of SES, we
analyzed county-level information because individual
data in this regard are also not collected.
Nonetheless, we have shown that men with stage I
seminoma have a higher risk of dying from nontesticular
causes than the age-adjusted US male population, including SMN and suicide, but, importantly, not CVD. Modern adjuvant radiotherapy may still increase SMN
mortality, but absolute risks appear to be considerably
lower than reported in older series.4-6 Alternatives to
radiotherapy, such as surveillance, should still be offered
to patients. Additional study of the role of health disparities in outcomes in stage I seminoma patients should also
be addressed in analytic studies that take into consideration detailed treatment information and patient demographic factors. Confirmation of the increased risk of
suicide is needed, and patients should continue to receive
psychosocial support as needed.38
