BACKGROUND: The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma
(UTUC) is poorly defined, both before and after nephrouretectomy. Although multimodal treatment paradigms for
UTUC are under-developed, this has important implications on patients’ ability to receive cisplatin-based combination
chemotherapy (CBCC). METHODS: Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the Modification
of Diet in Renal Disease formula in 336 patients with UTUC, who were treated at the Cleveland Clinic by nephroureterectomy since 1992. An eGFR cutoff of 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 was used to determine the presence of CKD and eligibility for CBCC. RESULTS: Median age was 72 years and median preoperative eGFR was 59 mL/min/1.73m2. Before
nephroureterectomy, only 48% of patients were eligible to receive CBCC and this decreased to 22% postoperatively
(P < .001). In the 144 patients with pT2-pT4 and/or pN1-pN3 disease who are suitable to receive CBCC, these proportions were 40% and 24%, respectively (P ¼ .009). Although 50 patients overall received some form of perioperative
chemotherapy, only 3 and 11 patients received neoadjuvant and adjuvant CBCC, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: CKD is
prevalent in the UTUC population and a minority of patients has an optimal eGFR to receive neoadjuvant CBCC.
Nephrouretectomy may eliminate CBCC as a therapeutic option in 49% of high-risk patients if it is deferred to the adjuvant setting. Multimodal treatment strategies for UTUC should focus on neoadjuvant chemotherapy, as few patients
are eligible for adjuvant CBCC because of the substantial decline in eGFR caused by nephroureterectomy. Cancer

Upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) includes urothelial malignancies occurring within the renal pelvis and ure-

ter. These tumors account for approximately 5% of all urinary tract cancers, which occur far more commonly in the bladder.1
Although UTUC commonly present as high-grade and advanced stage cancers, multimodality treatment paradigms for this
malignancy are underdeveloped because of its low incidence and the paucity of data from randomized trials. As such, the
standard treatment of UTUC is surgical excision by nephroureterectomy (NU), or distal ureterectomy in select patients with
distal ureteral tumors. Oncologic outcomes following definitive surgical management of high-grade and/or muscle-invasive
UTUC have been poor, with estimates of cancer-specific survival ranging between 60% and 80% at 5 years.2-4
The relatively poor outcomes of NU for invasive UTUC may be because of a multitude of factors, including delays
in diagnosis and treatment, more aggressive tumor biology, and inferior treatment strategies. Regarding the latter, there is
increasing evidence that the removal of an increasing number of lymph nodes at the time of radical cystectomy for invasive

bladder cancer leads to improved survival.5-7 In contrast,
retroperitoneal or pelvic lymph node dissection is not uniformly performed for UTUC.2,3,8-10 Likewise, the management of patients with invasive bladder cancer at risk
for recurrence typically involves radical cystectomy and
perioperative cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy
(CBCC), in either the neoadjuvant or the adjuvant setting. Few patients with UTUC receive neoadjuvant or
adjuvant CBCC and there is a paucity of evidence in
the literature (either from retrospective series or clinical
trials) of a benefit.2,3,8-10
The use of neoadjuvant methotrexate, vinblastine,
doxorubicin, and cisplatin (MVAC) chemotherapy for
invasive bladder cancer before definitive local treatment
confers an approximately 7% absolute improvement in
overall survival compared with cystectomy or primary
radiotherapy alone.5-7 Although similar evidence in
support of adjuvant CBCC is lacking, many in the genitourinary oncology community extrapolate from the neoadjuvant MVAC experience and hypothesize that the
benefits of CBCC are likely to be similar if it is administered in the adjuvant setting. By the same logic, perioperative CBCC for UTUC is frequently deferred to the
adjuvant setting, particularly given the inability to document the presence of invasive UTUC before NU.
The decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR) caused by NU may render a substantial number
of patients ineligible to receive CBCC if it is deferred to
the adjuvant setting. Patients undergoing radical nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma have a significantly
increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD; defined as
eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) compared with
those treated by nephron-sparing surgery.11 In a recent
study, 26% of kidney cancer patients had CKD preoperatively, which increased to 65% postoperatively for those
treated by radical nephrectomy.11 The prevalence of
CKD in the UTUC patient population, before and after
nephrouretectomy, is poorly defined. Compared with the
renal cell carcinoma population, patients with UTUC are
typically older and have a higher prevalence of comorbid
medical conditions, often related to tobacco use, which
may compromise renal function. Likewise, some patients
may have compromised renal function because of obstructive uropathy caused by the UTUC itself. In some populations, analgesic nephropathy is the cause of UTUC, again
with compromise of renal function. Thus, the presence of
pre-existing and NU-induced CKD may have important
implications on patients’ ability to receive perioperative
CBCC. Patients who are unable to receive CBCC may

2968

have compromised survival based on the inferiority of carboplatin versus cisplatin in the management of advanced
urothelial carcinoma.12
In the present study, we evaluated the renal function
of patients with UTUC before and after NU to determine
the proportion of patients with optimal renal function to
be considered for CBCC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Between 1992 and 2008, 470 patients with known or suspected urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis and/or ureter were treated at Cleveland Clinic (Cleveland, Ohio) by
NU, ureterectomy, nephron-sparing surgery, and/or endoscopic resection. The focus of this study is 336 patients
who underwent NU for UTUC and had sufficient data
for analysis of renal function and oncologic outcomes.
Patients undergoing partial nephrectomy (n ¼ 8), ureterectomy without nephrectomy (n ¼ 18), endoscopic resection (n ¼ 48), or having incomplete data (n ¼ 60) were
excluded. A subgroup of patients at high risk for recurrence (n ¼ 144) was identified based on the presence
of muscle-invasive UTUC and/or lymph node-positive
disease at the time of NU. Patient information and
follow-up data were obtained from an institutional
review board-approved database.
Pathologic staging was performed according to the
2002 American Joint Committee on Cancer guidelines
based on archived pathology reports. Selected cases were
re-reviewed by a genitourinary pathologist to determine
stage, grade, and the presence of lymphovascular invasion
when not initially available. All postoperative creatinine
levels and clinical information pertaining to renal function were obtained from the electronic medical records,
contact with referring physicians, or patient-completed
questionnaires. Preoperative creatinine levels were
obtained within 1 month of NU and the lowest creatinine
level obtained within 3 months after NU or before initiation of any adjuvant therapy was selected as the postoperative creatinine level.13 The eGFR was calculated using the
abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease
(MDRD) study equation (GFR in ml per minute per

<60 mL/minute/1.73m,2 according to National Kidney
Foundation guidelines.15,16
The preferred initial treatment approach for patients
with UTUC at Cleveland Clinic during the time period
of this study was definitive surgical resection with or

without lymphadenectomy. The decision to perform a
lymph node dissection and extent of this dissection varied
widely according to surgeon preference and technique.
Only those patients with locally advanced disease were
considered for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Adjuvant
chemotherapy was administered only to patients with
advanced pathological features (pT2 or pN1-pN3) and
who had adequate health and renal function to receive it.
However, among these patients, the decision to administer adjuvant chemotherapy was left to the discretion of the
treating physician and no standardized protocols were
employed at our institution during this time period. In
general, patients were followed postoperatively with regular clinical assessments, cystoscopy, urinary cytology, renal
function determinations, and imaging studies of the chest,
abdomen, and pelvis. Survival was determined by chart
review and telephone contact, and death from any cause
was verified using the Social Security death index.17
Statistical analyses were performed by using JMP
version 8.0 (SAS, Cary, NC). Kaplan-Meier survival
methodology was used to generate survival estimates and
curves. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare
nonparametric continuous data and chi-square and Fisher
exact tests to compare nominal data. The study was conducted according to Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act guidelines and received institutional
review board approval.

RESULTS
Data on 336 patients that underwent NU are depicted in
Table 1. Median age was 72 years (interquartile range
[IQR], 62-78) and 79% of patients had no or minimal
comorbidity (Charlson comorbidity index ¼ 0 or 1).
Overall, high-risk features (as defined by the presence of
muscle-invasive disease and/or lymph node metastasis)
were present in 144 patients (43%). At histological analysis, high-grade UTUC was present in 75% and stage was
Ta/Tis, T1, and T2 or higher in 35%, 21%, and 45% of
patients, respectively. Retroperitoneal and/or pelvic
lymph node dissection was performed in 78 (23%)
patients, and 32 (41%) of these patients had lymph node
metastasis (10% overall). Over a median follow-up of 19
months (IQR, 5-42), 154 patients (46%) died, 94 of
whom died from progressive UTUC. Overall, the median
and 3-year survival were 42 months (95% confidence
interval [CI), 33-51) and 54% (95% CI, 48-61), respectively. Considering only those patients with high-risk
features, the median and 3-year survival were 16 months

administered to 43 patients (13% of all patients, 30% of

CBCC in 11 patients, carboplatin-based regimens in 18,
and other regimens in 6 (Table 2).
The cancer-specific survival for patients with highrisk features was significantly reduced compared with
those without high-risk features (3-year survival 31%
[95% CI, 21-41] vs 86% [95% CI, 79-93]; P < .001)
(Fig. 1). The cancer-specific survival for high-risk patients

appropriately be considered for CBCC, the proportions
of ineligible patients before and after NU are 60% and
76%, respectively (P ¼ .009). Thus, the opportunity to
receive CBCC after NU was lost in 61% of patients (and
49% of high-risk patients) able to receive it preoperatively
(Table 4).

DISCUSSION
CKD is associated with a significant increase in cardiovascular events and death from any cause, independent of
competing comorbidities.18 CKD may also render
patients ineligible to receive CBCC because of concerns
of nephrotoxicity. Although CKD as a consequence of
radical nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma has been
reported previously, the present study is the first to document and quantify the risk of CKD associated with NU
for UTUC and the consequence of NU-induced eGFR
decline in terms of the delivery of perioperative CBCC. In
the present study, we demonstrate that CKD is present in
52% of patients with UTUC at the time of diagnosis. Following NU, a median 21% relative reduction in renal
function was observed and the proportion of patients with
CKD increased significantly to 78%. Based on a minimum eGFR of 60 mL/min/1.73m2 to receive CBCC,
61% of NU patients (and 49% of high-risk patients) were
rendered ineligible to receive CBCC by NU. These findings have important implications for the management of

patients with UTUC, as NU may eliminate a potentially
important therapeutic option for patients at risk for
metastatic cancer progression.
Because of concerns of nephrotoxicity, tolerability
and/or ease of administration, carboplatin (or other
agents) may be substituted for cisplatin in patients with
urothelial carcinoma in need of chemotherapy. In the
present series, CBCC was administered to only 3 of
8 patients (38%) receiving neoadjvuant therapy and 11 of
36 (31%) patients receiving adjuvant therapy. However,
carboplatin-based and other noncisplatin based regimens
are widely considered to be inferior to MVAC and gemcitabine-cisplatin.12,19-21 For example, in a randomized trial
of MVAC versus methotrexate-vinblastine-carboplatin in
patients with metastatic UC, a significantly reduced
cancer-specific survival was seen in patients receiving methotrexate-vinblastine-carboplatin (median 9 vs 16 months,
P ¼ .03).19 A single-study arm phase 2 trial of neoadjuvant paclitaxel-gemcitabine-carboplatin for muscleinvasive UC of the bladder also reported fewer pathologic
complete responses than had been reported in other trials
of neoadjuvant CBCC in similar patients.22 Thus, any

Cancer

June 15, 2010

substitution for CBCC as adjuvant therapy after NU for
high-risk UTUC because of NU-induced eGFR decline is
likely to lead to inferior results.
Given the lack of prospective trials of perioperative
chemotherapy for UTUC, it is common practice to
extrapolate from the bladder cancer experience as there is
little evidence to suggest that UTUC differs biologically
from UC of the bladder. The use of neoadjuvant CBCC
before definitive local treatment for invasive UC of the
bladder is supported by level I evidence of an overall
survival benefit in a randomized trial by the Southwest
Oncology Group and a meta-analysis of other randomized trials.5-7 In the former, a 25% and 40% relative risk
reductions in all-cause and cancer-specific mortality,
respectively, was observed in patients receiving 3 cycles of
MVAC before radical cystectomy compared with radical
cystectomy alone.5 A 5% absolute improvement in survival was also reported in a meta-analysis of 11 other phase
3 trials of neoadjuvant CBCC before radical cystectomy
or primary radiotherapy.6,7 Similar evidence for adjuvant
chemotherapy for invasive UC of the bladder is lacking,
although the existing trials have been limited by the use of

2971

Original Article

suboptimal regimens, flawed methodology, and/or inadequate power.23-29
The use of perioperative chemotherapy for UTUC
is controversial as there is no definitive evidence of a benefit but certain potential for toxicity. To our knowledge,
there are currently no open or planned trials evaluating
the role of neoadjuvant or adjuvant CBCC for UTUC.
Thus, if 1 is to employ perioperative CBCC in the management of patients with UTUC, it must (by necessity) be
based on extrapolation from the bladder cancer experience
and the feasibility of its administration in the neoadjuvant
or adjuvant setting. Regarding the latter issue, our results
indicate that only 48% of patients have sufficient eGFR
to receive neoadjuvant CBCC and this proportion
decreases to only 22% after NU. Thus, if perioperative
CBCC is to be given to patients with UTUC, it should be
administered in the neoadjuvant setting as roughly 50%
would be rendered ineligible to receive it if deferred to the
adjuvant setting due to NU-induced CKD. Although it is
difficult to establish the presence of muscle-invasive
UTUC before NU, the presence of biopsy-proven, highgrade UTUC in the presence of a sizable mass on preoperative imaging may be sufficient evidence to justify neoadjuvant CBCC. The level I evidence in favor of neadjuvant
CBCC for UC of the bladder (and lack of evidence of
adjuvant CBCC) is further justification for administering
perioperative CBCC for UTUC in the neoadjuvant
setting.
Similar to previous reports, the outcome of patients
with muscle-invasive and/or lymph node-positive UTUC
was poor.2-4 Factors that may have contributed to the relatively poor outcome of these patients in our series and
others was the under-utilization of a complete retroperitoneal and/or pelvic lymphadenectomy and perioperative
CBCC. If perioperative CBCC is to be adopted as a standard treatment paradigm with NU for UTUC, it should
ideally be supported by evidence from prospective clinical
trials. Given the relative rarity of this disease, such a trial
would require multi-institutional collaboration within the
cooperative group or intergroup mechanisms. Based on
the results of our study, it would also seem rational that
the design of such a trial should include neoadjuvant
(rather than adjuvant) CBCC. In the absence of such
a trial, physicians must rely on the available evidence for
the potential benefits and harms of perioperative CBCC
when making treatment recommendations for patients
with UTUC.
The impact of radical nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma on the development of CKD has renewed the em-

2972

phasis on nephron-sparing approaches for small renal
masses. In a recent update of its treatment guidelines for
small renal masses, the American Urological Association
recommends nephron-sparing approaches whenever
feasible.30 Given the incidence of pre-existing CKD in
patients with UTUC and the substantial risk of NUinduced CKD, it is appropriate to reconsider the role of
NU for all patients with UTUC. Tumors that are small,
noninvasive, low-grade, and amenable to a complete
resection or ablation may be effectively treated by the ureteroscopic approach (the risk of tumor seeding has limited
the appeal of the percutaneous endoscopic approach).
The development of smaller and more functional flexible
ureteroscopes and laser fibers has facilitated the treatment
and surveillance of UTUC. Currently, ureteroscopic
management is generally considered only for patients with
a solitary kidney, pre-existing CKD, or who are unfit to
undergo NU. However, given the risk of CKD with NU
and the low risk of progression associated with small, lowgrade lesions, ureteroscopic laser ablation may be a reasonable alternative for these patients. However, given the
inaccuracy of clinical grading and staging for UTUC and
the risk of recurrence, close surveillance is mandatory for
patients managed endoscopically.

CONCLUSION
In this retrospective analysis of a large case series of NU
for UTUC, we observed that NU caused a 21% median
relative reduction in renal function and that less than 50%
of patients with sufficient renal function to receive CBCC
preoperatively had sufficient renal function after NU to
receive it postoperatively. The use of perioperative CBCC
for UTUC is controversial. If 1 adopts a strategy of
perioperative CBCC for UTUC, our study suggests that it
should be administered in the neoadjuvant setting because
of the decline in renal function caused by NU.
