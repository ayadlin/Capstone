ABSTRACT
Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is strongly induced by hypoxia and its
overexpression is associated with poor therapeutic outcome in cancer. Here, we report
that hypoxia promotes tumour heterogeneity through the epigenetic regulation of
CAIX. Based on hypoxic CAIX expression we identify and characterize two distinct
populations of tumour cells, one that has inducible expression of CAIX and one that
does not. The CAIX+ve population is enriched with cells expressing cancer stem
cell markers and which have high self-renewal capacity. We show that differential
CAIX expression is due to differences in chromatin structure. To further investigate
the relationship between chromatin organization and hypoxic induction of CAIX
expression we investigated the effect of JQ1 an inhibitor of BET bromodomain proteins
and A366 a selective inhibitor of the H3K9 methyltransferase G9a/GLP. We identified
that these drugs were able to modulate hypoxic CAIX expression induction. This
further highlights the role of epigenetic modification in adaption to hypoxia and also
in regulation of heterogeneity of cells within tumours. Interestingly, we identified
that the two subpopulations show a differential sensitivity to HDAC inhibitors, NaBu
or SAHA, with the CAIX positive showing greater sensitivity to treatment. We propose
that drugs modulating chromatin regulation of expression may be used to reduce
heterogeneity induced by hypoxia and could in combination have significant clinical
consequences.

INTRODUCTION

factor (VEGF), pH regulation e.g. carbonic anhydrase
9 (CA9), and alterations in cellular metabolism e.g.
lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDHA) by binding to hypoxiaresponse elements (HRE) in their promoters [2]. CAIX
catalyzes the reversible hydration of CO2 to bicarbonate
and a proton. This enables tumours to maintain a more
neutral intracellular pH (pHi) which promotes survival but
produces a more acidic extracellular pH (pHe) [3] which
promotes invasion and metastasis. The expression of
CAIX is associated with poor survival in most cancers,
[4, 5 ,6].
Cancer stem cells (CSC) generate cancer cell

During tumour development, rapid expansion and
growth of cancer cells creates poorly vascularized regions,
characterized by hypoxia, with irregular blood flow, low
pH and nutrient starvation conditions which select for a
more aggressive tumour phenotype [1].
Cellular responses and adaptation to hypoxia
are mediated partly through stabilization of hypoxia
inducible transcription factors (HIFs). The HIFs induce
the transcription of many hypoxia-response genes,
involved in angiogenesis e.g. vascular endothelial growth

heterogeneity commonly observed in clinical samples.
However, most treatment strategies fail to address tumour
heterogeneity sufficiently. Hypoxia is linked with stem
cell niches. For example, the transcription factors HIF1α
and HIF2α have been linked to the stimulation of cancer
stem cells (CSCs) in glioblastoma [7, 8]. Wicha et al
showed that hypoxia induced by inhibition of angiogenesis
increases the population of breast CSCs in xenografts [9].
Accordingly, the poor patient survival and therapeutic
resistance that is associated with hypoxia may be a
result of increased proportion of CSCs in tumours [10].
Therefore, combination studies of currently identified
stem cell markers with hypoxic markers may give a direct
insight into the relationship between tumour heterogeneity
in response to hypoxia and the role of stem cells.
A promising hypoxic marker for such studies is
CAIX since its expression in normal tissues is limited
to niches that correspond to sites harboring adult stem
cells [11]. In addition, CAIX expression is required
for the maintenance of CSC, and plays a role in the
invasive potential of breast cancer cells and production of
mammospheres [12, 13].
In this study we demonstrate that there is marked
heterogeneity in CAIX expression within cancer cell
lines, in contrast to many other HIF-target genes. The
subpopulation that selectively induces CAIX is associated
with the regulation of stemness. Our results provide further
support to the notion that hypoxic regions serve as stem
cell niches, with CAIX being a key stem cell regulator. The
intracellular heterogeneity can be suppressed by inhibitors
of a “reader” and a “modifier” of chromatin. We propose
that strategies targeting the hypoxic subpopulations using
inhibitors of chromatin regulation will help to develop
new combination therapies against hypoxia and CAIX.

expression was confirmed by Western blotting (Figure
1C). Importantly, HIF1α was analysed after the sorted
populations were allowed to recover from hypoxia for
1 week, then re-exposed to 0.1% O2 for 24 hours. Both
populations produced the same levels of HIF1α but
CAIX remained differentially expressed (Figure 1B).
Moreover, under hypoxia in both populations only CAIX
had differential expression compared to the well-validated
hypoxia regulated genes LDHA, pyruvate dehydrogenase
kinase 1 (PDK1) and adenylate kinase 4 (AK4) (Figure
1B, 1C).

Only the CAIX+ve population of the MCF7 sorted cells has the ability to recapitulate the
original expression pattern
We then performed two rounds of sorting of
hypoxia-induced MCF-7 cells into CAIX+ve and
CAIX-ve populations. After 3 weeks in culture both
cell populations were reexamined for CAIX expression
using FACS analysis. The CAIX+ve population had
recapitulated the original unsorted phenotype, generating
both populations of CAIX+ve and CAIX-ve cells. The
CAIX-ve cells were not capable of reforming both
populations and they remained mainly negative for CAIX,
showing only a very low levels of CAIX expression
(Figure S4A). In order to further enrich for CAIX+ve cells
and CAIX-ve cells, a second round of FACS sorting was
performed. The extreme high 10% of CAIX positive cells
and the extreme low 10% of CAIX negative cells were
sorted and cultured in normoxic conditions for six months.
During long-term culture (6 months), the CAIX+ve cells
became heterogeneous, containing both CAIX+ve and
CAIX-ve populations when exposed to hypoxia, and thus
recapitulated the original unsorted expression pattern,
whereas the CAIX-ve cells continued to be homogenous,
and negative for CAIX expression after exposure of the
cells to 0.1% O2 hypoxia (Figure 2A). Thus we generated
CAIX+ve and CAIX-ve cell lines. We verified the CAIX
expression status in these at both, mRNA and protein
levels (Figure 2B, 2C).

RESULTS
Differential expression of CAIX under hypoxia
To determine the induction profile of CAIX we
performed a 72 hour time course under 0.1% O2. The
maximum expression of CAIX was at 72 hours both at
RNA (Figure S1A) and protein level (Figure S1B and
Figure S2). Therefore, subsequent hypoxic (0.1% O2)
experiments were performed at 72 hours. FACS analysis
in four cell lines, MCF-7, HCT116, SW1222 and MDAMD-231 showed that under hypoxic conditions (72 hours,
0.1% O2) there were two populations, in the first 3 cell
lines, which differentially expressed CAIX (Figure 1A).
The percentage of CAIX positive cells ranged from 30%
to 50% in the four cell lines tested (Figure S3A and S3B).
Using FACS sorting both CAIX positive (CAIX+ve)
and CAIX negative (CAIX-ve) cells were isolated from
the hypoxia incubated MCF-7 cell line, and CAIX

Molecular signature of the MCF-7 CAIX positive
and negative populations
In order to identify genes and pathways differentially
expressed between CAIX+ve and CAIX-ve cells, RNA
sequencing was performed. Cells were treated with
hypoxia (0.1% O2) for 72 hours then stained for CAIX
expression followed by cell sorting and RNA extraction.
2093 genes showed a greater than 2 fold up-regulation in
the CAIX-ve population and 2670 showed a greater than 2
fold up-regulation in the CAIX+ve population. Comparing
the gene expression pattern of these two populations under
hypoxia, and the unsorted population under hypoxia with

(Figure 4A). CAIX silencing in the CAIX+ve cell line
led to reduced gene expression of ALDH1 (p < 0.05, n
= 3), TWIST1 (p < 0.05, n = 3), and ABCC2 (p < 0.001,
n = 3), WNT2 (p < 0.01, n = 3), LIN28 (p < 0.01, n = 3),
but it did not effect the expression of SOX2 (Figure 4B),
showing that CAIX is involved as a mechanism as well
as a marker. In addition, the protein expression levels of
ALDH1 in the CAIX+ve cells sorted from two different
cells lines, MCF7 and HCT116 were also higher compared
to the CAIX-ve cells (Figure S4B).

(Hyp* = Corrected hypergeometric pValue)
a breast cancer hypoxia expression signature [14] showed
a similar core hypoxia response, with no difference in
expression of well established hypoxia genes (Figure 3A).
Interestingly, CAIX was the only hypoxia inducible gene
distinguishing these two populations. Furthermore, the
non-hypoxia regulated expression pattern of the CAIX+ve
population was significantly different from both the CAIXve and unsorted cells (Figure 3B). Strikingly, KEGG
pathway analysis showed that the differential CAIX+ve
signature was significantly enriched for pathways involved
in stem cell maintenance, such as the ABC transporters,
Wnt and Hedgehog signaling, tumour invasion and
metastasis (Table 1). In contrast, the CAIX-ve signature
was enriched for cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction,
MAPK signaling pathway, osteoblast differentiation and
ECM-receptor interaction pathway (Table 2).

The CAIX+ve cells are enriched for stem cell like
properties compared to CAIX-ve cells
We showed that only CAIX+ve cells possess the
capacity to drive the original heterogeneous phenotype, a
characteristic property of stemness [15, 16]. Importantly,
the MCF-7 CAIX+ve cell line had significantly higher
ALDH enzymatic activity (p < 0.01, n = 3) compared to
the MCF-7 CAIX-ve cell line (Figure 5A) as analysed
by the ALDEFLUOR assay. This is consistent with our
hypothesis as high ALDH activity is associated with
the self-renewal capacity and ability to recapitulate the
heterogeneity of the parental tumour [17]. Interestingly,
basal-like breast cancers, which are associated with stem
cell phenotypes and high ALDH1 expression also show
high CAIX expression [17, 18]. Moreover, our notion
that the CAIX+ve population is enriched with stem-like
cells is further supported by the fact that these cell has
the capacity to form significantly more second-generation
mammospheres compared to the CAIX-ve cell line (Figure
5B, p < 0.05, n = 3), a property known to be associated
with mammary stem/progenitor cells [13]. Interestingly,
there is no change in cell viability under normoxic or
hypoxic conditions between CAIX+ve and CAIX-ve cells
(Figure S5).

The CAIX+ve cells are enriched with cells
expressing stem cell markers
Several of the stem cell related genes were validated
by Q-PCR and were differentially expressed in the MCF-7
CAIX+ve sorted cells. We found that in CAIX+ve cells
expression of ALDH1 (p < 0.001, n = 3), WNT2 (p < 0.01,
n = 3), TWIST1 (p < 0.001, n = 3), LIN28 (p < 0.001,
n = 3), ABCC2 (p < 0.01, n = 3), IGF1 (p < 0.001, n =
3), SOX2 (p < 0.05, n = 3), was significantly upregulated

may affect the gene expression patterns, in vivo analysis
of effects of CAIX knockdown was conducted to assess if
there was concordance of these in vitro observations. To
this end, we produced a CAIX knockdown MDA-MB-468
(breast cancer) cell line using stable shRNA. The CAIX
knockdown significantly reduced xenograft growth rate (p
< 0.05, n = 5), (Figure 6C). Gene ontology analysis of
genes revealed that genes associated with stemness were
more highly expressed in the CAIX expressing xenografts
of MDA-MB-468 compared to the knockdown (Table S1).
Q-PCR analysis confirmed significantly higher expression
of stem cell associated gene such as: TWIST1 (p < 0.05,
n = 4), JAG2 (p < 0.05, n = 4), OCT4 (p < 0.05, n = 4)
and NANOG (p < 0.05, n = 4) (Figure 6D) in the CAIX
expressing xenografts of MDA-MB-468 compared to the
knockdown. The genes tested are stem cell marker genes.
There may be some differences in the relative expression
and dependence on stem cell related genes in different
systems i.e MCF-7 (ER positive breast cancer cell line)

We selected the SW1222 colon cancer cells
instead of MCF-7 breast cancer for our in vivo studies
in order to avoid the potential confounding effects of
estrogen supplementation. SW1222 has been previously
utilized successfully to model differential stem cell
phenotypes in this way previously [10] and has two
clear CAIX subpopulations (Figure 1A). These cells
differentially express the hypoxic marker CAIX (Figure
1A). Importantly, only the SW1222 CAIX+ve population
expresses the CD44+CD24+ stem cell markers [10]
(Figure S6). The SW1222 CAIX+ve cells formed tumours
significantly faster (p < 0.05, n = 5) than the CAIX-ve
population, when implanted at 1000 cells (Figure 6A) and

versus MDA-MB-468 (triple receptor negative breast
cancer). In addition to this, previous studies have shown
that CAIX is upregulated in basal-like breast tumours
[19], which are characterized by their stem like phenotype
[20]. Given the above and the fact that MDA-MB-231 and
MDA-MB-468 are basal-like breast cancer cell lines, we
postulate that the more uniform expression of CAIX in
these cell lines is due to the higher proportion of stem like
cells in these cell lines (Figure S7).

digestion. The MCF-7 CAIX-ve cells displayed a more
“closed” chromatin state as shown by the low accessibility
to nuclease digestion, which correlates with low mRNA
expression of CA9 (Figure 7A). In contrast, the MCF-7
CAIX+ve cells under hypoxia adopted a more “open” and
accessible chromatin state around CA9 promoter region,
which is associated with high expression of CA9 (Figure
7A). Interestingly both populations under normoxic
condition have a compact “silenced” chromatin.
To verify this data we performed chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) on MCF-7 CAIX+ve
and CAIX-ve cell lines to evaluate the levels of the
tri-methyl H3K9 histone, a well-validated marker of
heterochromatin. Under hypoxic conditions the MCF7 CAIX-ve cell line had significantly (p < 0.05, n = 3)
higher levels of tri-methyl H3K9 histone compared to
the MCF-7 CAIX+ve cell line, confirming the nuclease

digestion assay (Figure 7B). Given that HIF induces the
transcription of CA9 by binding to HRE in its promoters
we hypothesized that this interaction should be reduced
in our CAIX-ve cells. A significant (p < 0.05, n = 3)
reduction in binding of HIF1α to the CA9 promoter of
the negative population was identified as determined by
ChIP (Figure 7C). In addition, MCF-7 CAIX+ve and
CAIX-ve cell lines were treated with A366 a selective
inhibitor of the H3K9 methyltransferase G9a/GLP. A366
treatment under hypoxic conditions significantly increased
the level of CAIX expression in both MCF-7 CAIX+ve
and CAIX-ve cells as analysed by FACS (CAIX+ve p <
0.01, n = 3; CAIX-ve p = 0.01, n = 3)(Figure S8A and B),

and western blot (Figure S8C). The drug treatment impacts
on chromatin in both populations leading to the change
in CAIX expression, which may indicate that the effect
of A366 could be indirect. A366 did not affect HIF1α
stabilization (Figure S8C) levels of an alternative HIF
target gene LDHA.
Further to this MCF-7 CAIX+ve and CAIX-ve
cell lines were treated with a selective inhibitor of the
bromodomain family JQ1. JQ1 significantly reduced
CAIX expression (CAIX+ve p < 0.05, n = 3; CAIX-ve
p = 0.05, n = 3) (Figure 7D), but did not affect HIF1α
stabilization or LDHA expression (Figure 7E).

by affecting their survival. SAHA treatment significantly
(p < 0.05, n = 3) reduced the number of colonies of the
MCF-7 CAIX+ve cell line (Figure 8C) compared to the
colonies of the MCF-7 CAIX-ve cell line. Additionally, we
evaluated the CAIX expression in untreated and SAHAtreated colonies of the MCF-7 CAIX+ve cell line after
the 10d recovery. The expression of CAIX in the SAHA
treated colonies was significantly (p < 0.05, n = 3) reduced
compared to the untreated colonies (Figure S10).
To understand if the sensitivity of CAIX+ve cells to
SAHA was dependent on the CAIX status we transfected
the MCF-7 CAIX+ve population with CAIX RNAi or Scr
RNAi and then treated with SAHA for 72 hours under
hypoxic conditions. After 72hours SAHA was removed
from the medium, then cells were allowed to recover
for another 24hours under normoxia and the cell growth
was assessed by cell counting. Treatment with SAHA
significantly reduced cell growth of the cells transfected
with Scr RNAi (p < 0.05, n = 3) compared to the MCF-7
CAIX knockdown cells (Figure 8D). Moreover, growth
of the MCF-7 CAIX+ve cell line (p < 0.01,n = 3) was
also reduced as compared to the MCF-7 CAIX-ve cell
line (Figure 8D). These results suggest that expression of
CAIX confers sensitivity to SAHA treatment in the MCF-

Previous studies have shown that HDAC inhibitors
(NaBu and SAHA) induce early differentiation in
embryonic stem cells, by reducing the expression of key
regulatory stem cell genes such as SOX2, NANOG, and
OCT4 [10, 21, 22]. Given the above we tested the effect
of NaBu treatment on CAIX expression. We observed that
NaBu treatment caused a significant downregulation of
CAIX (p < 0.01, n = 3) expression and the expression of
the colon cancer stem cell marker CD133 (p < 0.05, n =
3) (Figure S9).
In order to verify this result we also investigated
the effect of SAHA, in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell
line. SAHA treatment significantly downregulated the
expression of CAIX (p < 0.05, n = 3) and the expression
of the breast cancer stem cell marker CD44 (p < 0.05,
n = 3) (Figure 8A). The expression of HIF1α was not
downregulated upon SAHA treatment, but the two
validated HIF and hypoxia regulated genes PDK1 (44%
reduction) and AK4 (80%) were, although to a lesser
extent than CAIX (95%) (Figure 8B).
Next we investigated whether SAHA induced CAIX
downregulation specifically targets MCF-7 CAIX+ve cells

using pharmacological inhibitors of chromatin modulators.
Given the higher levels of H3K9 methylation in the
CAIX promoter of the negative cells, we considered that
inhibition of the H3K9 methylation might induce CAIX
in this population. For this reason, we used a selective
inhibitor of the H3K9 methyltransferase G9a/GLP
(A366). In agreement with our hypothesis, treatment
with A366 resulted in induction of CAIX expression in
the CAIX-ve population. We also tested the effect of
inhibiting a chromatin modification reader, which reads
ξ-N-acetylation of lysines, by treatment with JQ1. JQ1
disrupts the binding of BET bromodomains to acetyl
lysines in the chromatin, a crucial event for the recruitment
of transcription factors necessary for gene activation.
In line with this, JQ1 treatment significantly reduced
CAIX expression. This highlights the role of epigenetic
modification in adaption to hypoxia and also in regulation
of heterogeneity of cells within tumours. Drugs targeting
chromatin modifiers influence CAIX levels and as such
may be used to reduce or target intra-tumour heterogeneity
and synergize with anti-VEGF therapy.
In conclusion, using CAIX as a hypoxic marker we
have identified for the first time a marked heterogeneity
in response to hypoxia within three tumour cell lines,
associated with major biological differences. We also
identified that NaBu and SAHA treatment lead to
elimination of the CAIX+ve population as well as a
significant reduction in the expression of the stem cells
associated genes CD44 and CD133. Consistent with this,
treatment of HT29 and CaCo2 colon cancer cell lines
with NaBu also causes a reduction in the expression of
CD133 and CD44 [26]. Additionally, it has been shown
that HDAC inhibitors induce early differentiation in
embryonic stem cells (ES), by reducing the expression of
key regulatory stem cell genes such as SOX2, NANOG,
and OCT4 [21, 22]. The differential sensitivity to
HDAC inhibitors may explain the relatively poor results
with this drug class in solid tumours, and suggests that
combinations targeting different hypoxic populations
should be investigated. The epigenetic mechanism that
drives the consistent induction of these two populations
implies a key differential hypoxia program that is
important for survival of a subpopulation of stem cells
in a pH buffer zone. We propose that strategies targeting
intra-tumoural heterogeneity using inhibitors of chromatin
regulation of heterogeneous expression, including the
regulation of CAIX could in combination have significant
clinical consequence.

DISCUSSION
Solid tumours, including breast cancer, are
composed of heterogeneous cell populations that interact
in complex networks. CAIX heterogeneity is associated
with disparities of many stem cell genes. Previous
studies have shown that CAIX expression is associated
with stem cell niches in normal tissues [11], and plays a
crucial role in the invasive potential of breast cancer cells
and mammospheres [12, 13]. Here we demonstrate that
the CAIX+ve gene signature was significantly enriched
for pathways and genes which have been shown to play
an important role in the recurrence and maintenance of
cancer stem cells [23], [24]. Accordingly, we also show
that only CAIX+ve cells possess the capacity to drive the
original heterogeneous phenotype, consisting of CAIX-ve
and CAIX+ve cells in long-term culture, a characteristic
measurement of stemness [15, 16]. Interestingly, our data
show that suppression of CAIX in vitro and in vivo causes
a significant downregulation of breast cancer stem cell
signatures. This suggest that CAIX does not serve only as
a marker for the enrichment of hypoxic cancer stem cells,
but its expression induces some stem cell phenotypes.
Inhibition of the carbonic anhydrase activity of CAIX
has been previously shown to deplete cancer stem cells
in tumours [12] in vivo suggesting that it is the ability
of CAIX to regulate pH that is key for stem cells. It is
unlikely that all CAIX+ve cells are stem cells per se or
that CAIX-ve cells have no stem cells. Nevertheless,
it is intriguing that the CAIX induction program is so
strongly associated with genes commonly expressed in
stem cells. One possibility is that this creates an extensive
microenvironment of regulated pH around the fewer stem
cells, a syncytial pH rim, as we showed previously in
spheroid models of CAIX expression [25].
We would suggest a term for this population, the
hypoxia induced ‘stem cell pH buffer zone’ producing
a pH-protected zone enriched for stem cell populations,
but having properties conducive to protect them from
environmental stress.
Alterations in global levels of specific modifications,
such as methylation or acetylation generate an additional
layer of epigenetic heterogeneity at the cellular level in
tumour tissues. Here we demonstrated that the molecular
mechanism underlying the differential expression of CAIX
is due to hypoxia induced reorganization of chromatin
structure. The CAIX-ve cells have a relatively “closed”
and transcriptionally silent CAIX promoter region
under hypoxia compared to a transcriptionally active
and “open” configuration in the CAIX+ve population.
We investigated the relationship between chromatin
organization and hypoxic induction of CAIX expression

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Methyl-Histone H3K9 ChIP Kit (Epigentek, Brooklyn,
NY) according to manufacturer’s instructions.

Cell culture

Aldefluor assay

Cells were maintained in a humidified incubator
at 5% CO2 and 37ºC. 5%. All cell lines were maintained
in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Hypoxic
incubations (0.1% O2, 5% CO2,) were performed using an
INVIVO2 400 hypoxic workstation (Pro-Lab Diagnostics).
Cells were treated with SAHA (Sigma) at 2 µM, NaBu
(Sigma) at 5 mM, JQ-1 at 200 nM. A366 and JQ-1 were
a gift from Dr Susanne Muller-Knapp (Target Discovery
Institute, University of Oxford, UK). Spheroids were
generated following the method described in [27].

To detect ALDH activity in cells, we used the
ALDEFLUOR kit from Stem Cell Technologies, according
to manufacturer’s instructions.

Generation of mammospheres
MCF-7 cells were detached, washed and plated
in a 6 well low attachment plates (Corning), filled with
3mL MammoCult Basal Medium and supplemented with
MammoCult proliferation Supplements, 4 µg/mL Heparin,
0.48 µg/mL Hydrocortisol and penicillin (100 U/mL),
streptomycin (100mg/mL). MCF-7 mammospheres were
started forming after day 4-6 and were processed at day
10. Secondary generation mammospheres were generated
by incubating the primary mammospheres with 1 X
Trypsin EDTA solution (PAA Laboratories) for 2-3 min
and resuspended in the above medium and plated again
in the low attachment plates. After 7 days the capacity of
cells to generate secondary mammospheres were tested
by visualizing the cells with the inverted light microscope
(Axiovert).

Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry was carried out as previously
described [28]. Samples were analyzed using a
DakoCytomation Cyan machine, or sorted using a
MoFlo cell sorter (Beckman Coulter). The bottom 10%
of CAIX negative subpopulation and the top 10% of
CAIX positive subpopulation were collected for further
experiments. The following primary antibodies were used
FITC conjugated CAIX (R&D systems), APC conjugated
CD133 (Miltenyi Biotec), APC conjugated CD44 antibody
(BD Biosciences) and PE conjugated CD24 antibody (BD
Biosciences).

Production of stable CAIX knockdown MDAMB-468 cells

Chromatin analysis

To knockdown CA9 in MDA-MB-468, the HuSH29 shRNA targeting CA9 (TR314250) and empty vector
(R20003) were purchased from Origene. The shCA9
sequence was cloned into pcDNA3.1. Cell lines were
transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Cell line pools were grown
under selective pressure [0.4 mg/mL G418 (Invitrogen)]
until no mock-transfected cells remained.

The quantitative assessment of chromatin states of
CAIX+ve and CAIX-ve cells was performed using the
EpiQ Chromatin analysis kit according to manufacturer’s
instructions (BioRad). Briefly CAIX+ve cell line and
CAIX-ve cell line were plated in 48 well culture plate to
80-95% confluent and exposed for 72hrs in 0.1% O2 or
they were maintained under normoxic conditions. Three
wells remained undigested and the other 3 wells were
digested with DNase nuclease I for 1 hour. Following
extraction and purification of the genomic DNA. The
nuclease sensitivity was assessed by qPCR (with primers
as shown in Table S6). The data were analysed using EpiQ
Chromatin Kit Data Analysis Tool (www.bio-rad.com/
epiq) The GAPDH region was used as a positive reference
gene region for an open chromatin.

Immunoblotting
Cell lysates were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE
and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane.
Primary antibodies were used at 1:1,000 unless otherwise
stated. The following antibodies were used, mouse antiHIF1α, (BD Transduction Laboratories, USA), mouse
anti-CAIX (Gift form J. Pastrorek, Institute of Virology,
Slovak Republic), goat anti-LDHA (Santa-Cruz), goat
anti-PDK1 (Santa-Cruz), goat anti-AK4 (Santa-Cruz),
mouse anti-ALDH (BD Biosciences), mouse anti-β actin
(Sigma). Blots were quantified with image analysis in
ImageJ.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
Immunoprecipitation assays for HIF-1α were
performed using the Upstate EZ ChIP Kit Reagents
and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay for
trimethylated H3K9 was done using the EpiQuik Triwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Real-time PCR (Q-PCR)

Office licence. SW1222 cells were exposed in hypoxia
for 72h and then were sorted in CAIX+ve and CAIX-ve
population. 1000 CAIX+ve, CAIX-ve and 200 CAIX+ve,
CAIX-ve cells were inoculated in six to seven-week old
male NSG mice subcutaneously in the lower flank with
100μL Matrigel (BD Bioscience). MDA-MB-468 EV and
shCA9 cells were inoculated in six to seven-week old
female BALB/c NuNu mice subcutaneously in the lower
flank with 1x107 with 50μL Matrigel (BD Bioscience).
Tumour growth was monitored three times per week
measuring the length (L), width (W) and height (H) of
each tumour using calipers. Volumes were calculated
from the formula 1/6 x π x L x W x H. When tumours
reached 1.44 cm3 the mice were sacrificed by cervical
dislocation. Ninety minutes prior to sacrifice, mice
were injected intravenously with 2 mg of pimonidazole
(Hypoxyprobe-1; Chemicon International, USA) as
described previously [33].

RNA extraction and the quantitative PCR protocol
have been described previously (33). The sequences of the
primers used are showing in Table S2.

RNA-sequencing and gene expression array
analysis
RNA was extracted as described above. The RNAseq was performed according to the sample preparation
guide (Illumina, TruSeq RNA). TopHat [29] was used to
align RNA-Seq reads to the human genome build 37.1.
Bedtools [30] was used to summarize the number of reads
per exon per transcript. Threshold for transcript presence
was set to 15 reads. Samples were then normalized using
the total number of mapped reads. The logarithm base 2
of the ratio of counts between conditions was estimated
and a filter was applied to select genes with an absolute
logarithm greater than 1; this is equivalent to one fold
change up- or down-regulation between conditions.
Enrichment for KEGG pathways (http://www.
genome.jp/kegg/) was performed using Genecodis 2.0
[31, 32]; Ensembl IDs (GRCh37 assembly) were used
as reference, hypergeometric test was used and false
discovery rate threshold was set to 0.05.
For Illumina expression. Briefly, RNA concentration
was normalized to 50ng/ul of which 11ul used to produce
biotin-labelled complementary RNA (cRNA) using
Illumina TotalPrep-96 RNA amplification kit from
Ambion #4393543. 750ng of biotin-labelled cRNA
from each sample was hybridized according to Illumina
whole-genome gene expression direct hybridization
assay from Illumina #11286340 to high-density Illumina
Human oligonucleotide arrays Human HT-12_V4_0_
R1_15002873_B; designed to detect 47,231 transcripts.
The Fluorescence emissions were quantitatively detected
using iScanner and data were extracted using BeadStudio
v20111.1 Software (Illumina Inc) which were imported
to GeneSpring GX 12.1 (Agilent Technologies, Inc.,
Santa Clara, CA) ; normalized with Shift to 75 percentile
and baseline transformed to median of all samples to
identify significantly differentially expressed genes with
FDR (Benjamini-Hochberg) corrected P-value cut off at
< 0.01. Functional and pathway analysis carried out on
differentially expressed genes to identify statistically
over-represented ontologies in the list using Database
for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery
(DAVID; Huang da et al., 2009b; Huang da et al., 2009a).

Gene silencing by RNA interference
Transfections of siRNA duplexes targeting CAIX or
a scramble control (scr) (ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool)
at a final concentration of 20 nM, were performed in
Optimem (Invitrogen), using Oligofectamine reagent
(Invitrogen). The sequences of siRNA used to target CAIX
were 118898, 9567 and 9473 (Invitrogen).

Clonogenic assay
CAIX+ve and CAIX-ve cells were seeded at
a density of 1000 cells per 6 cm dish in triplicates
and treated with 2 µM SAHA for 72h under hypoxic
conditions, untreated control cells were also included in
the experiment. After 72h the dishes incubated in hypoxia
were returned to normoxia for 10 days and allowed to
form colonies. Cell colonies were fixed and stained with
Methylene blue for 1 hour. Visible colonies were counted
using a ColCount automated colony counter (Optronix).

Statistical analyses
Statistical analysis and graphs were performed using
GraphPad Prism® v4.0 software (GraphPad). Statistics
were carried out using non-paired Student’s t-tests and
significance is represented by *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
and ***p < 0.001. Error bars represent mean ± Standard
Deviation (SD).
