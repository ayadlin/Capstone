BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of sorafenib, an oral vascular endothelial
growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, when added to standard radiotherapy and temozolomide in the firstline treatment of patients with glioblastoma multiforme. METHODS: After initial surgical resection or biopsy, patients
with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme received concurrent radiotherapy (2.0 grays [Gy]/day; total dose,
60 Gy) and temozolomide (at a dose of 75 mg/m2 orally daily), followed by 6 months of maintenance therapy with
temozolomide (at a dose of 150 mg/m2 orally on Days 1-5 every 28 days) and sorafenib (at a dose of 400 mg orally
twice daily). Patients were re-evaluated every 2 months; the primary endpoint of the trial was progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: A total of 47 patients were treated; 34 had undergone previous debulking surgery. Nineteen
patients withdrew from treatment before the initiation of maintenance therapy with temozolomide and sorafenib (12
because of early tumor progression). Twenty-eight patients (60% of enrolled patients) received 4 months of maintenance therapy with temozolomide and sorafenib, and 9 patients (19%) completed the planned 6 months of maintenance therapy. The median PFS for the entire group was 6 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 3.7-7 months),
with a 1-year PFS rate of 16%. The median overall survival was 12 months (95%CI, 7.2-16 months). Maintenance therapy
with temozolomide and sorafenib was found to be well tolerated by most patients, with no grade 3/4 toxicity
(according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria [version 3.0]) reported to occur in >10% of
patients. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of sorafenib did not appear to improve the efficacy of treatment when compared with the results expected with standard therapy. A substantial percentage of patients (40%) did not receive
any maintenance sorafenib, most often because of early disease progression. The administration of angiogenesis
inhibitors concurrently with radiotherapy and temozolomide may optimize the opportunity to improve therapy.

Glioblastoma multiforme, the most common primary brain tumor in adults, remains an incurable malignancy
with a short expected survival. For many years, optimal therapy for glioblastoma included maximal surgical cytoreduction
followed by high-dose radiotherapy. With this approach, the median survival was approximately 10 to 12 months.1,2
Recently, the addition of temozolomide concurrently with radiotherapy, and for 6 months after the completion of radiotherapy, was proven superior to treatment with radiotherapy alone.3 With this new treatment standard, the expected median survival is 14.6 months, with a 2-year survival rate of 26.5%.
Currently, several new targeted agents are undergoing evaluation in the treatment of patients with glioblastoma multiforme. Several signaling agents are known to be frequently overexpressed in glioblastoma, including vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor, and epidermal growth factor.4
Currently, the antiangiogenesis agents have been evaluated most extensively in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme.

Bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody, has
produced response rates of up to 50%, with a median survival in the range of 7 to 9 months, when administered
either alone or with irinotecan to patients with recurrent/
refractory glioblastoma.5-9 To the best of our knowledge,
the role of bevacizumab in the combined modality firstline treatment of patients with glioblastoma multiforme
has not been fully assessed to date; however, pilot studies
have demonstrated the feasibility and safety of the
concurrent administration of bevacizumab and radiotherapy.10,11
Inhibition of the angiogenesis pathway can also be
accomplished by intracellular inhibition of the VEGF
receptor. Sorafenib is a multitargeted oral tyrosine kinase
inhibitor, with inhibitory effects on the VEGF receptor,
PDGF receptor, and the Ras/Raf signaling pathway.12
Sorafenib has demonstrated activity and received US
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the
treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.13 Inhibition of the VEGF receptor accounts for at
least part of the activity of sorafenib in renal cell carcinoma. Sorafenib currently is being evaluated in several
other solid tumors, but to the best of our knowledge has
not been previously evaluated in the treatment of patients
with glioblastoma multiforme.
In this phase 2 trial, we added sorafenib to oral
temozolomide, after concurrent radiotherapy and temozolomide, in the first-line treatment of patients with glioblastoma multiforme. We report herein the results of this
multicenter, community-based phase 2 study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This phase 2 trial was initiated in April 2007, and was performed at selected sites in the Sarah Cannon Oncology
Research Consortium (Table 1). Before patients were enrolled, institutional review board approval was obtained
by all participating sites.

ern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0
or 1; age 18 years; and adequate bone marrow, liver,
kidney, and cardiac function.
Patients were excluded for the following reasons:
inability to swallow whole pills; active cardiac disease or a
history of myocardial infarction within 6 months; uncontrolled hypertension; known human immunodeficiency
virus, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C infection; history of
thrombotic or embolic events within the last 6 months;
women who were pregnant or lactating; and a history of
bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy. Patients who were
receiving a stable dose of warfarin for previous thromboembolic events were eligible if their International Normalized Ratio was stable and within therapeutic range. In
addition, standard exclusions for patients receiving antiangiogenesis agents were in effect for this trial (hemoptysis
or other bleeding event within 4 weeks of study entry; serious nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture; major surgery within 4 weeks of the initiation of treatment with
sorafenib; and concurrent use of CYP3A4 inhibitors or
inducers).
Before entering this trial, all patients were required
to provide written informed consent.

Eligibility
To be eligible for this trial, patients were required to have
histologically confirmed supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme (World Health Organization grade 4). Maximal
surgical resection or debulking was recommended when
possible; however, patients with inoperable glioblastomas
were also eligible. No previous treatment with radiotherapy, local chemotherapy (eg, Gliadel [polifeprosan 20
with carmustine implant] wafer), or systemic therapy was
permitted. Additional eligibility criteria included an East-

Pretreatment Evaluation
Before therapy was initiated, all patients underwent complete history, physical examination, complete blood
count, chemistry profile, prothrombin and partial thromboplastin time, and urinalysis. Radiologic evaluation
included magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head,
which was performed after any surgical procedure and
before the beginning of therapy. Tumor measurements
were performed in all patients before the initiation of
therapy.

Treatment
All patients entering this study were initially treated with
concurrent radiotherapy and temozolomide. After the
completion of radiotherapy, patients received no treatment for 4 weeks and then began 6 months of follow-up
treatment with concurrent oral temozolomide and sorafenib (Fig. 1).
Initial combined modality therapy was administered
using standard doses of radiotherapy and temozolomide.3
All patients received radiotherapy in single daily fractions,
Monday through Friday, at a dose of 2.0 grays (Gy)/day
to a total of 60 Gy. Radiotherapy techniques were similar
to those described by Stupp et al in their pivotal trial of
temozolomide and radiotherapy.3 Beginning on Day 1 of
radiotherapy, temozolomide at a dose of 75 mg/m2 orally
was given daily, continuing through the final day of
radiotherapy.
After the completion of combined modality therapy,
patients had a period of 4 weeks with no treatment. After
4 weeks, they began 6 months of treatment with temozolomide administered at a dose of 150 mg/m2 orally on
Days 1 through 5, repeated every 28 days. In addition,
they received sorafenib at a dose of 400 mg orally twice
daily on a continuous schedule. All therapy was withdrawn after the completion of 6 months of temozolomide
and sorafenib.
The use of steroids was permitted for cerebral edema
throughout the study. Every attempt was made to maintain or decrease the daily steroid dose, as clinically indicated. If patients were receiving steroids before the
initiation of radiotherapy, the steroid dose could not be
weaned below a dexamethasone dose of 2 mg twice daily
until after radiotherapy was completed.

Dose Modifications
During combined modality therapy, all attempts were
made to administer radiotherapy without interruption.
Patients with grade 4 toxicity that was considered to be
because of radiotherapy had treatment interrupted for
1 week, or until the toxicity decreased to grade 3 or less,
with resumption of dosing at that time. Radiotherapy was
also discontinued for a platelet count of <20,000/lL, and
was restarted when the platelet count rose above this level.
During radiotherapy, the temozolomide dose was
modified for myelosuppression. Temozolomide was continued as long as the absolute neutrophil count (ANC)
remained >1500/lL and the platelet count remained
>100,000/lL. If the ANC was between 1000 and 1500/
lL or the platelet count was between 75,000 and
100,000/lL, a 25% dose reduction occurred. If the ANC
was <1000/lL or the platelet count was <75,000/lL,
temozolomide was withdrawn for 1 week, and restarted at
a 75% dose only after the ANC rose to >1500/lL and the
platelet count rose to >100,000/lL. The dose of temozolomide was reduced to 75% after any episode of neutropenia and fever, and was also reduced for any reversible
grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity.
During maintenance therapy with temozolomide
and sorafenib, the dose of temozolomide was lower, but
the criteria for dose reductions were the same as described
earlier. The most common expected toxicities with sorafenib were skin toxicity and hypertension. For the first episode of grade 2 skin toxicity, sorafenib was interrupted
until resolution, and then restarted at the same dose. If the
toxicity recurred or skin toxicity was grade 3/4, sorafenib
was again interrupted until resolution, and then restarted
at a 50% dose. Patients with grade 3 hypertension had

3665

Original Article

sorafenib interrupted until their blood pressure could be
controlled with standard measures; sorafenib could then
be restarted. Sorafenib was discontinued for grade 4
hypertension. For other reversible grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicities, sorafenib was decreased to a 50% dose.
Determination of Response
All patients underwent repeat MRI scans after the completion of combined modality therapy. Patients with no evidence of disease progression continued treatment with the
combination of temozolomide and sorafenib, with subsequent MRI scans performed at 8-week intervals until tumor progression was documented. Radiologic response
was defined using the criteria established by Macdonald
et al.14
Statistical Analysis
The purpose of this nonrandomized phase 2 trial was to
obtain preliminary efficacy data regarding this novel firstline treatment regimen. Progression-free survival (PFS)
was the primary efficacy endpoint. Secondary efficacy
endpoints included objective response rate and overall
survival.
The expected median PFS produced by standard
first-line therapy (radiotherapy and temozolomide
followed by 6 months of temozolomide) is reported to be
7 months.3 An improvement in PFS by 25% (ie, from
7 months to 9 months) would be a clinical result considered worthy of the further investigation of this regimen.
To detect such a difference, the inclusion of 46 evaluable
patients in this phase 2 trial was necessary.
PFS was defined as the interval from the initiation of
study treatment until the date of disease progression or
death. Overall survival was defined as the interval from
the first day of treatment until the date of death. All
patients who received at least 1 dose of therapy were
included in the toxicity analysis. Toxicity was graded
according to the National Cancer Institute Common
Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0). Survival curves were constructed according to the method of Kaplan and Meier.15

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between April 2007 and July 2008, 47 patients were enrolled into this clinical trial. Patient characteristics are
detailed in Table 2. The median age of the patients was 54
years; 31 patients (66%) were male. Thirty-seven patients

toma before study entry (only 1 complete resection was
performed), whereas 10 patients (21%) had only undergone a biopsy. In the 10 patients who did not undergo
surgical resection, the tumor was either multifocal (5
patients) or in an unfavorable area for resection (5
patients). Thirty-five patients (74%) were receiving dexamethasone during combined modality therapy.
Treatment Received
Forty of 47 patients (85%) completed the initial combined
modality therapy with temozolomide and radiotherapy.
Seven patients (15%) failed to complete this treatment for
the following reasons: tumor progression in 2 patients, worsening neurologic symptoms in 2 patients, treatmentrelated toxicity in 2 patients, and intercurrent illness (pneumonia) in 1 patient. Thirty-nine of the 40 patients who
completed combined modality therapy completed the
planned radiotherapy dose without any interruptions
related to treatment toxicity. One patient had a 2-day interruption in radiotherapy while hospitalized for treatment of
a deep venous thrombosis. After the 4-week interval without treatment, 28 of the 40 patients who completed radiotherapy had maintenance therapy initiated with
temozolomide and sorafenib. Twelve patients did not begin
maintenance therapy for the following reasons: tumor progression in 8 patients, patient/physician decision in 3
patients, and treatment-related toxicity in 1 patient.
The median duration of treatment with temozolomide and sorafenib was 4 months (range, 1-6 months).

Efficacy
The best responses recorded during therapy were as follows: partial response in 6 patients (13%), stable disease
in 25 patients (53%), and disease progression in 13
patients (28%). Three patients who discontinued treatment before completing radiotherapy were unevaluable
for response.

Toxicity
Treatment-related toxicity during maintenance treatment
with the combination of temozolomide and sorafenib is
detailed in Table 3. Maintenance treatment was well tolerated by most patients, with grade 3/4 toxicity being
uncommon. Grade 3/4 toxicities attributed to sorafenib
included hand-foot skin reaction (7%), fatigue (7%), and
skin rash (4%). In addition, 11 patients developed grade
2 skin toxicity related to sorafenib (either rash or handfoot skin reaction); 10 of these patients required dose
reduction (7 patients) or treatment discontinuation (3

DISCUSSION
The availability of agents targeting novel cellular pathways
has improved the possibility of developing better treatments for patients with glioblastoma multiforme. To our
knowledge to date, experience with several angiogenesis
inhibitors has confirmed the importance of the angiogenesis pathway in the growth and progression of

3667

Original Article

glioblastoma multiforme. Bevacizumab has been investigated more extensively than other agents in the treatment
of patients with glioblastoma. Several studies have demonstrated objective response rates of up to 50% with bevacizumab, either alone or with irinotecan, in patients with
recurrent or refractory glioblastoma.5-9 These data led to
the recent FDA approval of bevacizumab for the treatment of patients with refractory glioblastoma.
The activity of angiogenesis inhibitors in refractory
glioblastoma has led to interest in incorporating these
agents into first-line combined modality therapy. In the
trial reported herein, we added sorafenib, an oral inhibitor
of the VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase, to standard firstline therapy with radiotherapy and temozolomide.
Because safety data were lacking with regard to the concurrent use of sorafenib with high-dose radiotherapy to
the brain, we added sorafenib to temozolomide after the
completion of radiotherapy. With this novel treatment
program, efficacy results similar to the traditional combination of radiotherapy and temozolomide were achieved
(median PFS and overall survival of 6 months and
12 months, respectively). Maintenance therapy with
temozolomide and sorafenib was found to be well
tolerated by the majority of patients; however, a large
number of patients (40%) withdrew from the therapy
program before receiving any sorafenib, usually because of
early tumor progression and/or progressive neurologic
symptoms.
Several factors may have contributed to the apparent
failure to improve treatment efficacy by adding maintenance sorafenib. First, a large number of patients were
unable to receive sorafenib, usually because of early tumor
progression and/or clinical deterioration during combined modality therapy. We considered the possibility
that some of these patients may have been removed from
treatment prematurely because of pseudoprogression.
However, this appears unlikely because only 3 of the 8
patients who â€˜â€˜progressedâ€™â€™ after radiotherapy were able to
receive further treatment, and the other 5 died within
2 months. Second, it is possible that our patients represented a group with an unusually poor prognosis. However, the demographics (including the percentage with
unresectable tumors) are similar to those of other reported
studies.3,16-18 The complete resection rate (as determined
from the surgeonâ€™s description) was relatively low in the
current study patients; however, this determination is
somewhat subjective. Third, to the best of our knowledge,
the amount of penetration of sorafenib into central
nervous system tumors is unknown. The penetration of

3668

sorafenib into the brain was low to moderate when
administered to normal rats.19 However, the blood-brain
barrier is known to be compromised in patients with glioblastoma, and it appears unlikely that sorafenib would
penetrate less well than bevacizumab, a large protein.
Finally, the addition of small molecule tyrosine kinase
inhibitors to chemotherapy has not consistently improved
treatment results, even when both components of therapy
have individual efficacy.20,21
Recently, phase 2 studies have demonstrated the feasibility of administering concurrent radiotherapy and
temozolomide with bevacizumab as first-line therapy.11,22
In a group of 70 patients, bevacizumab (administered at a
dose of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) was administered concurrently with standard doses of radiotherapy and temozolomide; this treatment was followed by maintenance
temozolomide and bevacizumab. The median PFS was 13
months, which compares favorably with retrospective
results of conventional radiotherapy and temozolomide at
the same institution (median PFS of 8.1 months).11 A definitive, randomized phase 3 trial comparing standard
radiotherapy and temozolomide, with or without bevacizumab, as first-line therapy for patients with glioblastoma
is currently accruing patients.
In summary, the addition of sorafenib to temozolomide maintenance as part of first-line therapy for glioblastoma did not appear to substantially improve the results
expected with traditional combined modality therapy.
The high early dropout rate in the current study (before
the administration of any sorafenib) impaired the ability
to critically assess the role of sorafenib in this setting.
Future investigation of sorafenib or other inhibitors of
angiogenesis should include concurrent treatment with
radiotherapy. Continued evaluation of agents inhibiting
other critical pathways, including phosphotidylinositide
3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, is also critical for improving
the dismal prognosis of patients with glioblastoma.
