ABSTRACT
Mammalian apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease 1 (APE1), a ubiquitous
and multifunctional protein, plays an essential role in the repair of both endogenous
and drug-induced DNA damages in the genome. Unlike its E.coli counterpart Xth,
mammalian APE1 has a unique N-terminal domain and possesses both DNA damage
repair and transcriptional regulatory functions. Although the overexpression of APE1
in diverse cancer types and the association of APE1 expression with chemotherapy
resistance and poor prognosis are well documented, the cellular and molecular
mechanisms that alter APE1 functions during tumorigenesis are largely unknown.
Here, we show the presence of full-length APE1 and N-terminal truncated isoforms
of APE1 in tumor tissue samples of various cancer types. However, primary tumor
tissue has higher levels of acetylated APE1 (AcAPE1) as well as full-length APE1
compared to adjacent non-tumor tissue. We found that APE1 is proteolytically cleaved
by an unknown serine protease at its N-terminus following residue lysine (Lys) Lys6
and/or Lys7 and after Lys27 and Lys31 or Lys32. Acetylation of these Lys residues
in APE1 prevents this proteolysis. The N-terminal domain of APE1 and its acetylation
are required for modulation of the expression of hundreds of genes. Importantly, we
found that AcAPE1 is essential for sustained cell proliferation. Together, our study
demonstrates that increased acetylation levels of APE1 in tumor cells inhibit the
limited N-terminal proteolysis of APE1 and thereby maintain the functions of APE1
to promote tumor cells’ sustained proliferation and survival.

oxidative and drug-induced DNA damages in the genome
via the base excision repair (BER) pathway [1–3]. In
addition to its DNA repair function, APE1 also activates
the DNA-binding activity of many stress-inducible
transcription factors (TFs) including c-Jun, P53 and NF-kβ
through its redox activator (Ref-1) function [4–7]. Finally,
APE1 has a third and distinct function; it also functions

as a direct transcriptional co-activator or co-repressor of
many genes involved in cell growth and chemotherapeutic
drug resistance [7–12].
APE1 is essential for embryonic development [13]
as well as for cell viability and/or proliferation in culture
[14, 15]. Human APE1 has an N-terminal disordered
domain (1-42 amino acid; aa) and possesses both DNA
repair and transcriptional regulatory activities [16]. The
N-terminal domain contains the nuclear localization signal
[17] and multiple Lys residues that can be modified by
acetylation and ubiquitination [18–20]. The C-terminal
portion (aa 61-318) of APE1 is essential for DNA repair
function (AP-endonuclease activity) [21]. Previously, we
reported that Lys6 and Lys7 in the N-terminal domain
of APE1 can be acetylated (AcAPE1) by the histone
acetyltransferase (HAT) p300 in cultured cells and this
acetylation modulates the transcriptional co-regulatory
activity of APE1 [9, 11, 18]. Other Lys residues (Lys27,
31, 32 and 35) in the N-terminal domain of APE1 are also
found to be modified by acetylation in HeLa cells and
mutation of these residues can modulate the DNA damage
repair activity of APE1 [19].
Overexpression of APE1 in tumor cell lines and
various cancer tissues including lung, ovarian, colon,
glioma, head and neck, breast, and prostate have been
observed [22–24]. APE1 levels, as well as its altered
subcellular localization, have been associated with tumor
promotion and progression as well as poor prognosis
and lack of responsiveness to chemotherapy [24–26].
Knockdown or impairment of the redox or DNA repair
function of APE1 by small molecules inhibitors inhibits
tumor cell proliferation and sensitizes cells to a variety of
chemotherapeutic agents [24, 27–29]. Given the elevated
levels of APE1 in tumor cell lines and cancer tissues of
diverse origins, this enzyme has emerged as an important
therapeutic target [24, 26].
Overexpression of APE1 in a variety of cancers
as well as its association with chemotherapy resistance
and poor prognosis has been well documented. Little is
known about how the different functions of APE1 may be
regulated via alteration of post-translational modifications
during tumorigenesis. In this study, we show that the
post-translational regulation of APE1 in tumor tissue is
distinct from that observed in cultured cells. Specifically,
we observed that primary tumor tissues have higher
levels of AcAPE1 as well as full-length APE1 compared
to adjacent non-tumor tissues. We characterized that
the N-terminal domain (1-33 amino acids) of APE1
is cleaved by a limited proteolysis in both tumor and
adjacent non-tumor tissue. However, in tumor tissue, the
N-terminal limited proteolysis of APE1 is reduced by
the enhanced acetylation of multiple Lys residues in this
domain. Modulation of APE1 or AcAPE1 levels in tumor
cells alters expression of hundreds of genes and APE1
acetylation is essential for sustained cell proliferation.

Presence of full-length APE1, N-terminal
truncated APE1 isoforms and elevated
levels of AcAPE1 in tumor samples
We compared APE1 levels in non-small cell lung
carcinoma (NSCLC) tissue samples to the adjacent
non-tumor tissue from patients. Western blot analysis
using anti-APE1 antibodies (Ab) revealed increased
levels of APE1 in the tumor tissue compared to
adjacent non-tumor tissue (Figures 1A & 1B). Notably,
the predominant APE1 band observed in all nontumor tissue had faster mobility compared to the 37
kD band corresponding to APE1 present in cultured
lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells and full-length (FL)
recombinant (Rec.) APE1 (Figures 1A&1C). By contrast,
all tumor tissue demonstrated a prominent FL APE1 and
the faster-migrating APE1 bands (Figures 1A &1B). In
contrast, NEIL1, another DNA BER enzyme, was present
as a single band in both tumor and adjacent normal
tissues from NSCLC patients (Figure S1). As expected,
we observed a significant increase in PCNA level, a
marker for cell proliferation in tumor extracts compared
to non-tumor (Figure 1D). The two APE1 isoforms and
their differential abundance patterns were also observed
in tumor versus adjacent non-tumor tissue in colon and
pancreatic cancer patients (Figure 1E & 1F). Together,
these data suggest the presence of two isoforms of APE1
in a variety of cancer types.
Next, we investigated the acetylation status of
APE1 in NSCLC tissue utilizing our previously generated
AcAPE1-specific Ab [9, 11]. Specifically, this AcAPE1specific Ab was generated using the N-terminal peptide
containing 1-13 amino acids (aa) with acetylated Lys
at position 6 [9]. We have previously shown that this
Ab is highly specific in recognition of AcAPE1 species
acetylated at Lys6 position and does not cross react with
50-fold excess of unmodified APE1 [9]. Furthermore, this
antibody recognized ectopic WT APE1 but was unable
to detect non-acetylable K6R/K7R APE1 mutant protein
[7, 30]. Using AcAPE1 Ab we found that the levels of
AcAPE1 in tumor-adjacent non-tumor tissue were below
the level of detection. However, AcAPE1 levels were
significantly increased in all tumor tissue (Figure 2A).
Likewise, we observed a significant increase in AcAPE1
levels in colon and pancreatic cancer tissue relative to nontumor controls (Figure 2B & 2C). Immunohistochemical
analysis confirmed increased nuclear AcAPE1 staining
in tumor compared to non-tumor tissue (Figure 2D). The
near complete absence of AcAPE1 in NSCLC-adjacent
non-tumor tissue (Figure 2A) raises the possibility that
APE1 may be truncated at the N-terminus. In fact, we
observed that in tumor-adjacent non-tumor tissue extract,
APE1 was not detected by the Ab specific to the APE1

N-terminal peptide (residues 1-14), but a significant APE1
band was present in corresponding tumor tissue extracts
(Figures 2E & S2). As expected, the faster-migrating
band in adjacent-non-tumor tissue was observed when
the same immunoblots were probed with an Ab raised
against full-length APE1 (Figure 1A). The absence of
APE1 splice variants in either tumor or non-tumor tissue
as confirmed by RT-PCR (data not shown) eliminates the
possibility that alternative RNA splicing produces the
N-terminally deleted APE1 isoform. These collective
data strongly suggest that both full-length APE1 and its
N-terminal truncated isoform are present in tumor and
tumor-adjacent non-tumor tissue and that elevated levels
of AcAPE1 are also present in tumor tissue compared to
adjacent-nontumor tissue.

tumor or tumor-adjacent non-tumor tissue extract. Two
truncated forms of APE1 were produced in the absence
of protease inhibitors (Figure 3A, left panel), and were
identical to the APE1 isoforms observed in the patient
tissue samples (Figure 3A, right panel). This data
indicates that both tumor and tumor-adjacent non-tumor
tissue extracts have proteolytic-processing activity that
cleaves recombinant APE1 in vitro in the absence, but
not in the presence, of protease inhibitor cocktails (Figure
3A). Moreover, by incubating a constant amount of
recombinant APE1 with increasing amounts of non-tumor
tissue extracts, the shift from FL to two truncated forms
of APE1 occurred in a dose- and time- dependent manner
indicating a limited proteolysis of FL APE1 (Figures 3B,
3C & 3D). Extracts isolated from tumor-adjacent tissues
of patients with colon, pancreas, ovarian and lung cancer
(Figure S3), as well as resected normal tissues from the
ovary, endometrium, fallopian tubes and peripheral blood
mononuclear (PBMN) cells of healthy persons (Figure
3E), also demonstrated APE1-specific cleavage activity
in this in vitro assay. Extracts from cultured A549 cells

Putative serine protease(s) cleaves APE1 after
Lys6 or Lys7, Lys27 and Lys31 or 32

also showed APE1 cleavage activity, albeit to a much
lesser extent (Figure 3F). Like APE1, histone H3 has
positively charged unstructured N-terminal (1-35 aa)
domain. DNA glycosylase NEIL1 has a C-terminal
(289-389 aa) unstructured domain [31, 32]. However,
the absence of cleavage of either recombinant Histone
H3 or NEIL1 (Figure S4) in this in vitro assay indicates
that the protease(s) responsible for APE1 cleavage in
the tissue extracts does not cleave all proteins that have
unstructured N- or C-terminal domain. Using specific
inhibitors of various classes of proteases, we identified
the APE1-cleaving protease(s) to be serine protease(s)
as both reversible serine protease inhibitor AEBSF
and irreversible trypsin-like serine protease inhibitor
leupeptine completely prevented APE1’s proteolysis
(Figure 3G). By contrast, cysteine-specific inhibitor E64,
or aspartic acid protease inhibitor pepstatin A did not
prevent the proteolysis of APE1. Thus, the proteolysis of
the N-terminal domain of APE1 is mediated by a trypsinlike serine protease(s).

To determine the nature of the truncated N-terminal
forms of APE1, we isolated the two APE1 isoforms
generated after proteolysis by SDS-PAGE and transferred
them to a nylon membrane for N-terminal sequencing by
Edman degradation. Cleavage following residue Lys6
and/or Lys7 generated the higher molecular weight
proteolytic product (top band), the lower molecular
weight proteolytic product resulted from cleavage of
the N-terminal segment following Lys27, Lys31 and/
or Lys32 (Figure 4A). Thus the lower molecular weight
band corresponds to a mixture of un-resolved APE1
bands cleaved after residues Lys27 and Lys31 or Lys32.
Taken together these data indicate that a currently
unknown protease(s) cleaves APE1 in between Lys6
and 7 or after Lys7 and also after Lys27 and Lys31
or 32; thus generating primarily two N-terminally
truncated isoforms of APE1 (N∆7 and N∆27 or N∆32;

FL APE1 in tumor tissue. This raises the question of what
specifically protects APE1 molecules from N-terminal
cleavage in tumor cells. One or multiple mechanisms
may be involved in regulation of limited proteolysis of
APE1. Previously, we discovered that the N-terminal
Lys6/7/27/31/32 residues of APE1 can be reversibly
acetylated in cells [18, 19]. Because these residues are
also susceptible to cleavage by APE1-specific serine
protease(s) (Figure 4A) we postulated that acetylation of
these residues may prevent proteolytic cleavage of APE1
in tumor tissue. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found
that the protease(s) present in tissue extracts were unable
to cleave recombinant acetylated APE1 (Figure 4D and
4E). Thus it is possible that acetylation of the N-terminal
Lys residues protects APE1 from limited proteolysis and
the increased acetylation level of APE1 in tumor tissues
is one of the mechanism by which tumor cells prevent
N-terminal proteolysis of APE1.

domain of APE1 prevents proteolyticcleavage in tumor tissue
Despite the presence of the APE1-specific
proteolytic-processing activity in both tumor and adjacentnon-tumor tissue extracts, we observed significant levels of

the AcAPE1 Ab. Confocal microscopy data indicated that
AcAPE1 staining was strictly nuclear, whereas APE1 was
observed both in nucleus and cytoplasm in primary lung

hypothesized that APE1 and its acetylation regulate
expression of diverse sets of gene and promotes cell
proliferation. To explore this possibility, we first examined
the effect of various doses of three different APE1-sepcific
siRNA oligonucleotides on downregulation of endogenous
APE1 level in A549 cells. Figure 5C shows that while
APE1-specific siRNA1 and siRNA2 were highly effective
in decreasing the APE1 protein level in a dose-dependent
manner, siRNA3 had not much effect. Furthermore,
consistent with previous reports by us and others [9, 27,
33], we observed a significant (>80%) reduction in the
APE1 protein level at a 80 nM dose of siRNA, without
having any off-target effects as evidenced by the absence
of changes in the α-tubulin and HSC70 protein levels
(Figure 5C). Using Affymetrix HGU133 Plus 2.0 array,
we compared the gene expression profile of A549 control
cells to APE1-depleted A549 cells as well as A549 cells

in which the AcAPE1 levels were further increased
by treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor,
trichostatin A (TSA; Figure 6A & S6). Bioconductor/R
Limma-based data analysis identified modulation of 743
unique genes in APE1-depleted cells compared to control
(fold change ≥ 1.25; list of genes in Supplementary Table
1). Further analysis of TSA-treated control versus TSAtreated APE1-depletion identified up- or down-regulation
of 732 unique genes (fold change ≥ 1.25; genes list in
Supplementary Table 2). A representative Heat Map
(Figure 6A) revealed the set of genes, affected either by
modulating endogenous APE1 level (control vs. APE1siRNA2) or its acetylation (TSA-treated control vs. TSAtreated APE1 siRNA), that are likely to be specifically
regulated by acetylation of APE1. Using Real Time RTPCR analysis we validated the expression of some of
these genes involved in cell proliferation: SFN, RAC1,
CCNA2, H2AFY, CDK2, HDGFRP3 in control vs. APE1knockdown (K/D) A549 cells with both APE1-siRNA1
as well as APE1-siRNA2 (Figure 6C). The similar
expression patterns of these genes after downregulation
of APE1 level by two independent APE1-specifc siRNA
confirms that these genes are regulated by APE1 (Figure
6C). Ingenuity Systems based pathway analysis showed
a significant proportion of genes involved in cell survival
and proliferation pathways are deregulated by elevated
AcAPE1 in A549 cells (Figure S7) with a strong linkage
to cancer (Figure S8).
To further confirm that the N-terminal domain
of APE1 and its acetylation are involved in modulating
gene expression, we examined the effect of ectopic WT,
non-acetylable K6R/K7R (RR) or N-terminal 42 aa
deleted (N∆42) APE1 mutants. We used immortalized
bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells which express low
levels of APE1 for ectopically expressing these mutants
(levels are shown by Western blot analysis in Figure S9).
A representative Heat Map (Figure 6B) revealed that
many of the same gene were up- or down-regulated in
RR and N∆42 expressing cells relative to the WT control
( list of genes shown in Supplementary Tables 3 and
4), thus confirming the role of APE1 N-terminal region
in gene regulation through acetylable Lys residues. A
Venn diagram analysis (Figure S10) also showed that
a significant proportion of the genes that were up- or
down-regulated in the WT versus N∆42 comparison were
similarly differentially expressed in the WT versus RR
analyses comparison. We further validated the expression
of some of these genes involved in cell proliferation
such as HMGA1, TGM2, CDKN1B, CDK2, EMP1 and
FOSL1 in BEAS-2B cells expressing WT vs. RR (Figure
6D, left panel) or WT vs. N∆42 APE1 (Figure 6D,
right panel). Ingenuity Systems based pathway analysis
displayed that significant proportion of genes involved
in cell growth and survival pathways are affected in the
absence of N-terminal domain of APE1 or its acetylation
(Figure S11).

The requirement of APE1 acetylation for regulation
of expression of diverse sets of gene in multiple pathways
raise the possibility that elevated levels of AcAPE1 in
tumor may be essential for sustained proliferation of
tumor cells. We sought to determine the requirement of
the acetylation of APE1 for cell proliferation. We used
our previously generated HEK293TAPE1siRNA cells stably
expressing APE1 siRNA under an inducible doxycycline
promoter. Inducible-downregulation of endogenous APE1
in HEK293TAPE1siRNA cells by doxycycline (Dox)-treatment
[11], significantly decreased the number of viable cells.
This effect could be rescued by ectopically expressing
WT APE1 but not with the non-acetylable K5R, K5Q and
NΔ33 mutants (Figure 6E). Our data show that acetylation/
deacetylation cycles of Lys residues the N-terminal
domain of APE1 also play an essential role in cell growth
and proliferation because mutation of the five acetylable
Lys (Lys 6,7,27,31 &32) residues to either non-acetylable
Arginine (K5R) or acetylation mimic K5Q mutant affects
the cell growth and proliferation. Furthermore, using a soft
agar assay, we found that stable expression of WT APE1,
but not the N-terminal deleted APE1 mutant enhances
the anchorage-independent growth of BEAS-2B cells
(Figure 6F). Together, these data suggest that not only the
N-terminal domain but also acetylation/deacetylation of
Lys residues in this domain plays an essential role in cell
growth and proliferation.

DISCUSSION
Over the last 20 years, APE1 expression and its
subcellular localization has been primarily examined
in fixed, paraffin-embedded, tissue-sections from
diverse cancer types and matched controls using
immunohistochemical techniques [24, 26]. By contrast,
in the present study, using immunoblot analysis of cancer
tissue lysates we discovered that post-translational
regulation of APE1 in tumor tissue is distinct from that
observed in fixed tissue section and cultured cells. A
consensus exists among several studies that all (tumor
and transformed) cell lines contain predominantly fulllength APE1 [7, 9, 11, 34, 35]. In contrast, we observed
that in tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissue APE1 is
proteolytically cleaved at its N-terminus by a currently
unknown serine protease(s). Enhanced acetylation of
APE1 in tumor cells inhibits this proteolysis and our data
show that the acetylation of N-terminal domain of APE1
is involved in modulating the expression of genes involved
in sustained cell proliferation and/or survival. Thus,
increased APE1 acetylation levels in tumor cells and the
resulting inhibition of N-terminal limited proteolysis of
APE1 represent a novel mechanism by which cancer cells

maintain APE1 functions and thereby sustain expression of
genes associated with cell cycle progression and survival.
Our novel findings of limited N-terminal proteolysis
of APE1 and the existence of two APE1 isoforms in
cancer were unexpected because this phenomenon was
not reported previously. The failure to observe these
isoforms previously is likely due to the fact that unlike
our current study that employed immunoblot analysis,
most of the earlier studies utilized immunohistochemical
analysis of tissue-sections. Using immunoblot analysis
of various cancer tissue samples, we have established
the presence both full-length APE1 and its truncated two
isoforms in cancer. However, unlike tumor and adjacent
non-tumor tissue extracts from cancer patients, all cultured
cell lines have predominantly full-length APE1 [7, 34,
35]. This raises the question regarding what signals and/
or conditions trigger the APE1 N-terminal proteolysis
in tumor and in adjacent non-tumor tissue. We postulate
that multiple signals are essential for activation of APE1proteolysis in tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissue. The
tumor microenvironment, which is characterized by acute/
chronic hypoxia, low extracellular pH levels, elevated
oxidative stress and altered interaction of tumor cells with
stromal cells, likely contributes to the activation of the
APE1 proteolysis by the protease [36]. In addition, the
presence of the truncated isoforms of APE1 in adjacent
non-tumor tissues suggests that the surrounding nonmalignant tissue is likely to be influenced by the adjacent
tumor. It is also now clear that interplays between tumor
cells and the microenvironment are complex and exert
a profound influence on adjacent-normal tissue [36].
Cleavage of the APE1 N-terminus by a protease under
certain conditions is not unprecedented. Indeed, previous
studies have shown that the APE1 N-terminal domain
(1-33 aa) is cleaved after induction of DNA damage in
HL60 cells [37]. Similarly, inhibition of protein synthesis
or mitochondrial electron chain transportation was shown
to induce the cleavage of N-terminal 33 amino acids of
APE1 in HeLa cells [34]. It has also been shown that
APE1 is targeted and cleaved at Lys 31 by Granzyme
A (GzmA), a highly abundant serine protease found in
cytotoxic granules of T-lymphocytes during cytotoxic
T-cell-mediated apoptosis [38]. Still, the APE1-specific
serine protease described in this study is unlikely to be
GzmA given its presence in many tissues. Our data show
that serine protease cleaves APE1 at or after multiple Lys
residues in the N-terminal domain of APE1 that undergo
posttranslational modification by acetylation in cells.
However, the protease was unable to cleave the N-terminal
domain of APE1 when it is acetylated. We should point out
that in addition to these five acetylable Lys residues the
N-terminal domain (1-42 aa) of APE 1 contains multiple
Lys and arginine residues including Lys 3, Lys 24, Lys 25,
Lys 35, Arg 4 and Arg18. However, our in vitro cleavage
assay of recombinant APE1 by tissue extracts revealed that

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the protease cleaves specifically at or after acetylable Lys
6, 7 and Lys27, 31 and 32. Because these Lys residues
can be acetylated in cells and APE1 acetylation is
enhanced in S-phase, higher levels of AcAPE1 in tumor
cells is consistent with the predominant presence of fulllength APE1 in tumor tissue compared to adjacent nontumor tissue. Moreover, earlier studies demonstrated that
APE1 acetylation level increased after oxidative and /
or genotoxic stress or under inflammatory condition in
cells [30, 39].Thus we propose that alteration of APE1
acetylation level in tumor cells in vivo could be one of the
mechanisms by which proteolysis of APE1 is prevented
under malignant condition. However, we cannot eliminate
the possibility of involvement of other mechanisms
including some other posttranslational modifications of
APE1 and/or the protease itself in regulation of APE1
cleavage. Our lab is currently working on this issue.
Our study raises one fundamental question about
the role of N-terminal domain of APE1 and its acetylation
in cells. It is intriguing to note that unlike its E. coli
counterpart Xth, mammalian APE1 is unique in that it has
a disordered N-terminal 42 aa extension and possesses
both DNA repair as well as transcription regulatory
functions [40]. We showed earlier that all cells irrespective
whether they are primary normal or transformed or tumor
have AcAPE1 [7, 9]. This suggests that AcAPE1 performs
some important functions in cells. Consistent with this
idea, previous studies by our group and others have
shown that acetylation/deacetylation of the Lys residues
of APE1 modulates both its transcriptional regulatory
function and DNA repair function via maintaining
association and dissociation of APE1 with the partner
proteins [9, 19, 41, 42]. Studies by our group and
others have shown that the N-terminal 33 aa of APE1 is
required for interaction with its many interacting partners
proteins [8-11, 35], and APE1 acetylation modulates their
interactions [9, 11, 19]. We showed earlier that APE1
acetylation enhances its interaction with YB-1 and could
promote chemotherapeutic drug-resistance by modulating
expression of the key drug efflux transporter protein
MDR1 [9, 11]. Moreover, previous studies have revealed
the association of APE1 with RNA Pol II complex and
with TFs including p53, YB-1, estrogen receptor and
coactivators like p300 on the promoter bound complexes
of many genes [8, 11, 43]. Consistent with this, our current
study show that deletion of APE1 N-terminal domain or
modulation of its acetylation in multiple tumor cell lines
affects expression of hundreds of genes essential for cell
survival and proliferation. Although validation of these
results with patients’ primary tumor samples is important,
however, our gene expression data with A549 as well as
immortalized lung epithelial BEAS-2B cell line revealed
significant overlap of the genes that are affected after APE1
downregulation or in the absence of N-terminal of APE1
or its acetylation. Moreover, our IPA analysis revealed

22599

Oncotarget

that the APE1 N-terminal domain and its acetylation
regulate expression of genes that are linked to sustained
cell proliferation and growth. Thus our data strongly
suggest that APE1 and its acetylation play an important
role in activation of a subset of proliferation-specific as
well as housekeeping genes for maintaining sustained
proliferation and survival. Because the N-terminal domain
and the acetylable Lys residues of APE1 modulates both
its transcriptional regulatory and DNA damage repair
functions, it is expected that acetylation/deacetylation
cycles of Lys residues the N-terminal domain of APE1
also play an essential role in cell growth and proliferation.
Supporting this, we showed earlier that all cultured tumor
cell lines have higher AcAPE1 levels compared to nontumorigenic cell lines [7, 9]. In this study, we discovered
an additional role of acetylation of APE1 in tumor
cells in regulating the limited N-terminal proteolysis of
APE1 under malignant condition. Thus, we propose that
under malignant condition in vivo cell-cycle-dependent
increased APE1 acetylation in proliferating cancer cells
not only inhibits proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminal
domain but also facilitates its transcriptional regulatory
function to promote cell proliferation and survival [7,
19, 41]. In summary, our study demonstrates that the
N-terminal domain of APE1 is cleaved by an unknown
serine protease in tumor. Enhanced APE1 acetylation in
tumor cells prevents this proteolysis and thereby maintains
transcriptional regulatory function of APE1 and promote
cell proliferation and survival.

and the supernatants were stored at −80°C. Tissue extracts
equivalent to 40-60 μg of total protein were separated by
SDS/PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis with
different α-APE1 antibodies (Abs): mouse monoclonal Ab
(1:2000 dilution, Novus Biologicals; # NB100-116); rabbit
polyclonal Ab (1:300 dilution) raised against the whole
protein [44]; N-terminal 1-14 aa specific goat polyclonal
Ab (1:200 dilution, Novus Biologicals; # NB100-897).
α-NEIL1 Ab at 1:1000 dilution [45], α-PCNA Ab at 1:1000
dilution (Calbiochem; # NA03), α-HSC70 at1: 5000
dilution (B6-Sc7298, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), α-αTubulin at 1: 2000 dilution (Sigma: # T6199) Abs were
used. The affinity-purified AcAPE1 Ab (1:200 dilution)
was raised against the N-terminal 1-13 aa containing
peptide with acetylated Lys6 residue as described earlier
[9, 11]. Tissue lysates prepared in the absence of protease
inhibitors were used in the experiments for analyzing the
effect of cellular protease(s) on recombinant APE1.

In vitro cleavage assay
Recombinant APE1 was purified as described
previously [46]. APE1 protein (1 microgram) was
incubated for 45 min at 37°C with extracts isolated from
tumor or adjacent non-tumor tissue in the presence or
absence of protease inhibitors. Western blot analysis was
performed with different α-APE1 Abs on 100 nanograms
of APE1. For dose and time course-experiments, 6 μg of
APE1 was incubated with either increasing amounts (100
ng-20 μg) of tissue extracts for 45 min or with 10 μg of
tissue extracts for different time periods in the absence of
protease inhibitors and subjected to SDS/PAGE followed
by Coomassie Blue staining.

(Sigma; ID: SASI_Hs01_00027147,) and universal
control (Sigma) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)
following manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were harvested
after 72 hrs. and total RNA was isolated before or after
4 hour treatment with TSA (100 ng/ml; Calbiochem).
Generation of Wild-type (WT) APE1, N-terminal 42
amino acid deleted (NΔ42), mutant APE1 expression
constructs in a pcDNA3 vector backbone and with
FLAG-tagged WT APE1, K6R/K7R (RR), or N-terminal
33 amino acid deleted (N∆33) mutant APE1 in PCMV5.1
expression plasmid was described earlier [8–11]. Single
or combination mutations of residues K6,7,27,31,32 to
glutamine (K5Q) or arginine (K5R) in FLAG-tagged WT
APE1 were generated using a site-directed mutagenesis
Kit (Stratagene) following manufacturer’s protocol. Cells
were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 followed by
protein and RNA isolation after 48 hrs.

RNA from control and experimental samples in three
biological replicates was submitted to UTMB Molecular
Genomics Core Facility for carrying out micro-array
based gene chip hybridization. An Affymetrix HGU133
Plus 2.0 array comprised of more than 54000 probe sets
that corresponds to approximately 30,000 characterized
genes was used. Data analysis was performed in
Bioconductor/R using the CEL files. The R module/
package Affy was used to perform the pre-processing
steps which includes the RMA method for background
correction and quantile normalization. Linear Models for
MicroArray (Limma) was used to fit linear models for
analyzing designed experiments and the assessment of
overall gene expression and contrast analysis comparing
the experimental groups [47]. The significance of a gene
is calculated using the eBayes function that computes
moderated F-statistics combing the t-statistics from all
the available contrasts. This F-statistics determines if
genes are differentially expressed across any contrast. The
p-value is calculated based on the moderated t-statistics
and F-statistics followed by FDR adjustment. Further, the
modules topTable and decideTests were used to extract
and summarize the results. To estimate overlap between
two analyses, Venn Diagrams were created using the
method “global” in the function “decideTests”. Heat maps
were created on genes significant at p value < 0.001 or
0.00001. Finally the probe sets with fold change ≥ 1.25
(for up-regulated genes) and ≤ 0.8 (for down-regulated
genes) were selected and uploaded to Ingenuity Systems
based Pathway Analysis (IPA, Redwood City, California)
for functional analysis. All microarray data have been
submitted to NCBI following the guidelines for Minimum
Information About a Microarray Gene Experiment
(MIAME) and the accession number is GSE74572.

Cell cycle analysis
BJ-hTERT cells were synchronized by serum
starvation in medium containing 0.05% serum for 72 hrs.
Cells at Go/G1 stage were then supplemented with serum
to allow cell cycle progression and cell lysates were
prepared at different time points. Cell cycle studies were
performed as previously described by FACS analysis at
UTMB’s Flow Cytometry Core Facility [11].

Immunostaining
Overnight cultured cells on cover slips were fixed
for 10 min at room temperature with solution containing
4% paraformaldehyde, 10 mM PIPES buffer pH 6.8, 2
mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl2, 7% sucrose, 100 mM KCl, 50
mM NaF, and 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate. Cells were
rinsed in PBS for 20 min, followed by permeabilization
with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, and then re-rinsed.
Cells were incubated in blocking solution (3% bovine
serum albumin in PBS) for 30 min followed by 1 hour
incubation with primary Abs. Rabbit α-AcAPE1 (1:50)
and mouse α-APE1 (1:100), in blocking solution at room
temperature were used. After three 10 minute washes in
PBS, cells were incubated with Alexa-Fluor 488, 568
and 633-conjugated secondary Abs in blocking solution
(Molecular Probes/Invitrogen). Finally, cells were washed
with PBS, counter stained with DAPI Ab (Invitrogen;
1:1000), and mounted. Images were obtained using a Zeiss
LSM-510 confocal microscope with a 63X, 1.4 numerical
aperture oil immersion objective at Confocal Imaging
Laboratory at UNMC.
