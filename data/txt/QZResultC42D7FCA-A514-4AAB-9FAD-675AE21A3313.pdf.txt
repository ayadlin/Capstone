ABSTRACT
An outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has been reported in South and Central
America and the Caribbean. Neonatal microcephaly potentially associated with ZIKV
infection has already caused a public health emergency of international concern.
Currently, there are no clinically effective vaccines or antiviral drugs available to treat
ZIKV infection. The methyltransferase domain (MTase) of ZIKV nonstructural protein
5 (NS5) can sequentially methylate guanine N-7 and ribose 2′-O to form m7NGpppA2′Om
cap structure in the new RNA transcripts. This methylation step is crucial for ZIKV
replication cycle and evading the host immune system, making it a target for drug
design. Here, we present the 1.76 Å crystal structure of ZIKV MTase in complex with
the byproduct SAH, providing insight into the elegant methylation process, which will
benefit the following antiviral drug development.

INTRODUCTION

S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) as a byproduct (Figure
1A). This methylation step is crucial for ZIKV replication
cycle and evading the host immune system [12, 13].
Defects in MTase are lethal for flaviviruses, which makes
MTase a potential target for rational drug design against
flaviviruses. Although the crystal structure of ZIKV MTase
bound to SAM and 7-methyl guanosine diphosphate
(7-MeGpp) was recently published [14], the stepwise of
catalytic mechanism is still largely unknown. Here, we
present the 1.76 Å crystal structure of ZIKV MTase in
complex with the byproduct SAH, providing insight into
the elegant methylation process, which will benefit the
following antiviral drug development.

Zika virus (ZIKV), a member of the Flavivirus
genus in the family Flaviviridae, is transmitted primarily
by Aedes mosquitoes. It has attracted the attention
worldwide due to the severe threats to public health [1–6].
ZIKV infection during pregnancy may cause microcephaly
in newborn infants [3–7] and is also considered as a trigger
of Guillain-Barré syndrome [7, 8]. ZIKV is closely related
to Dengue Virus, West Nile Virus, and other flaviviruses.
There are no clinically effective vaccines or antiviral drugs
available to treat ZIKV infection to this date.
ZIKV nonstructural protein 5(NS5) is a
multi-domain protein, which has an N-terminal
methyltransferase domain (MTase) and a C-terminal
RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) domain. The
MTase can sequentially methylate guanine N-7 and ribose
2′-O to form m7NGpppA2′Om cap structure in the new RNA
transcripts [9–11]. The methylation starts with transferring
the methyl group from the donor S-adenosylmethionine
(SAM) to the methyl acceptor and then leaves the

the structure of PDB ID: 5KQR [14] as the original
search model with the Rfree of 19.9% and Rwork of
17.2% (Supplementary Table 1). The MTase forms a
well-defined 3D structure consisting of nine α-helixes
(cyan, α1-α9), nine β-strands (magenta, β1-β9), and
multiple loop regions. Together, the α4-α8, β2-β8, and
interspersed loops form the Rossman fold, which is a
protein structural motif that binds nucleotides (Figure 1B,
Supplementary Figure 1). In this structure, the byproduct
SAH binds in the pocket of the N-terminal portion of the
Rossman fold, which is primarily surrounded by α4-α6,
β2, β3, β5, and adjacent loop regions. Clear electron

density can be identified for SAH (Figure 1B and
Supplementary Figure 2). In the complex structure, SAH
is stabilized by hydrogen bond network formed between
the ligand and the adjacent residues. Among them, H110,
E111, V130, and D131 form the hydrogen bonds with
the adenosyl group of SAH; S56, W87, and D146 form
the hydrogen bonds with the homocysteine group of
SAH (Figure 1C–1D). The ligand comes in contact with
residues K105, G106, and E111 by ionic interactions.
Furthermore, the side chains of F133, V132, and I147
can stack together with the base of SAH to enhance
hydrophobic interactions (Figure 1C).

The conformational changes of ZIKV MTase
upon converting SAM to SAH

K28, and K29 in α2 helix have significant conformational
changes in both the backbone and the side chains. The
main chain moved as far as 1.1 Å and caused the binding
channel to shrink. Additionally, the residues ranging from
21 to 29 form a well-define α helix (α2) in our structure
instead of a random coil in the published structure with
7-MeGpp (PDB ID: 5KQS).
Taken together, both the SAM/SAH binding pocket
and the 7-MeGpp binding channel decreased in size upon
converting SAM to SAH during catalysis.

In order to understand the stepwise catalytic
mechanism for ZIKV MTase, we compared our structure
with the published MTase structure in the presence of
7-MeGpp and SAM (Figure 2A). The overall structure
of ZIKV MTase in complex with SAH is very similar
with the reported one (PDB ID: 5KQS) with a RMSD of
0.242 Å (205 out of 266 Cαs). Meanwhile, the byproduct
(SAH) was overlaid quite well with the substrate (SAM).
However, we found that the size of the substrate/
byproduct-binding pocket decreases dramatically upon
converting SAM to SAH. The binding pocket was closed
mainly through two gatekeeper residues: E149 and H110.
And the surface area of the binding pocket decreased
from 907 Å2 to 867 Å2. Additionally, the top region of the
binding pocket forms a defined α helix (α6) instead of a
random coil.
Interestingly, we noticed that the 7-MeGpp binding
channel (Figure 2B) is significantly narrower in the
presence than in the absence of 7-MeGpp. No obvious
conformational changes were observed for the top region
of the binding pocket, which is composed of the residues
E149, S150, S151, and S152. However, the bottom region,
which comprises residues M19, S20, A21, L22, E23 in the
loop connecting α1 and α2, and residues F24, Y25, S26,

DISCUSSION
ZIKV MTase structure is highly conserved in the
genus Flavivirus. The comparison of our structure and
those of other flavivirus MTases has shown that this
protein is well conserved among the genus. The RMSD
between the structure of ZIKV MTase and those of
Dengue virus (for 230 Cαs, PDB ID: 4V0Q [15]), yellow
fever virus (for 227 Cαs, PDB ID: 3EVA [16]) and West
Nile virus (for 228 Cαs, PDB ID: 2OY0 [17]) are 0.52 Å,
0.47 Å and 0.53 Å, respectively. The high homology of
flavivirus MTases suggests that it could be a drug target to
develop wide-spectrum antivirals.
The conformational changes of both SAM and
7-MeGpp binding sites of MTase upon converting SAM
to SAH during catalysis has not been reported for any

and Rfree of 19.9%. The Ramachandran plot generated
by PHENIX software package showed that the residues
located in the favored and allowed regions are 98.1%

flavivirus. In our study, the comparison of these structures
at high resolution provides accurate details to elaborate
the stepwise catalytic mechanism for flavivirus MTase,
providing the structural basis for rational drug design
against ZIKV or other flaviviruses. The future research
will focus on the structures of MTase in complex with
initial substrate GpppA-RNA, final product m7NGpppA2′OmRNA, and other transition state mimics to elucidate the
RNA capping mechanisms, which is essential for the viral
replication cycle and evading host immune system.

COOT and PYMOL (The PYMOL Molecular
Graphics System, Version 1.8 Schrödinger, LLC) were

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protein expression and purification

Protein structure accession number

The ZIKV MTase (residues 1–266) coding fragment
was inserted to the BamHI and XholI restriction sites of the
pET28b-SUMO vector for expression in the Escherichia
coli BL21 (DE3). Cells were grown in LB medium
at 37°C and then induced by 0.5 mM isopropyl-β-Dthiogalactopyranoside at 16°C. The cells were harvested
and resuspended in lysis buffer A (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0,
0.5 M NaCl, 5% glycerol and 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol)
and lysed by high pressure homogenization. The
supernatant after centrifugation was loaded onto the NiNTA column (GE). The column was washed using buffer
A supplemented with 20 mM imidazole and eluted using
buffer A supplemented with 250 mM imidazole. After
concentration by ultrafiltration, protein sample was diluted
into buffer B (50 mM HEPES, pH7.5, 0.5 M NaCl, 5%
glycerol), and the fraction containing (His)6-SUMO-ZIKV
MTase was cleaved with ULP protease at 4°C overnight.
The protein sample was then re-loaded on the Ni-NTA
column to remove the (His)6-SUMO and the ULP protease
and further purified by sequential chromatography: cation
exchange column (Hi Trap SP 5 ml, GE) and gel-filtration
column (Superdex 75 10/300 GL, GE). MTase was finally
concentrated to 10 mg/ml (0.33 mM) and mixed with 1.98
mM SAH prior to crystallization.

The refined coordinates have been deposited in the
PDB under accession number 5WXB.
