Urothelial carcinoma (UC) remains a significant health problem affecting an estimated 68,810 people in 2008 alone in the US. The majority of patients with metastatic disease develop disease recurrence, and long-term survival rates are poor.
There is no standard of care for the treatment of patients with UC after the failure of cisplatin-based regimens in the first-line setting. Efforts to improve second-line treatment have led to the evaluation of single agents such as vinflunine
and pemetrexed, and multidrug combinations with cytotoxic and targeted agents,
including trastuzumab and bevacizumab. The authors reviewed the activity of
several single agents and combination regimens in patients with UC. Emerging
strategies for the measurement of response in clinical trials were also outlined.

ladder cancer is the fourth most common malignancy in men
and the ninth most common in women in the US, with an estimated 68,810 new cases (51,230 men and 17,580 women) and
14,070 deaths (9950 men and 4120 women) for the year 2008.1
Approximately 25% of patients initially present with advanced (muscle-invasive or metastatic) disease, in which systemic chemotherapy
is an immediate component of definitive therapy. The majority of
patients present with superficial disease (ie, tumors that do not
invade the muscularis mucosa) with a generally favorable prognosis.
However, even these favorable tumors may require more intensive
intervention over time. Approximately 70% of patients with superficial disease develop disease recurrence, with 10% to 20% ultimately
progressing to muscle-invasive disease.2 Despite definitive surgery
with cystectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection, approximately
50% of these patients develop disease recurrence and require systemic chemotherapy within 5 years.3 Greater than 90% of bladder
cancers diagnosed in the US are transitional cell carcinomas of the
urothelium.4 It is important to note that these tumors also arise
from the urothelial lining of the urinary collecting system, including
the ureter, renal pelvis, and urethra; these tumors behave in a manner similar to those originating in the bladder. Thus, urologists and
oncologists alike refer to these tumors as urothelial carcinoma (UC),
and virtually all of the chemotherapy trials include UC from all primary sites.

Second-line Therapy for Bladder Cancer/Gallagher et al

Over the past 25 years, clinical trials have
demonstrated that UC is a chemotherapy-sensitive
malignancy. However, early responses to chemotherapy are not typically durable, and the vast majority
of patients develop disease recurrence with no current standard of care in the second-line setting. This
article will review the role of chemotherapy in UC
and provide an additional focus on the evaluation of
therapies in the second-line setting, including published clinical trials as well as the development of
novel targeted agents.

CHEMOTHERAPY FOR BLADDER CANCER
Chemotherapy for metastatic disease
Before the era of modern chemotherapy, the median
survival of patients with recurrent or metastatic UC
was 6 months.5,6 Historically, cisplatin and methotrexate were found to be the most active agents7;
however, the combination did not offer a significant
benefit over either drug alone.8,9 Cisplatin, methotrexate, and vinblastine chemotherapy achieved a
response rate (RR) of 56% and a median overall survival (OS) of 8 months.9 With the introduction of the
4-drug regimen of methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (M-VAC), combination chemotherapy demonstrated a high overall RR and a
median survival of 13 months.10 In this landmark
study, complete responses (CRs) were observed,
resulting in the first reports of long-term survival.
Subsequently, 2 prospective randomized trials established M-VAC as the standard of care in the metastatic setting, demonstrating a survival benefit over
cisplatin alone by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG)11 and over a cisplatin combination
regimen (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin).12 However, although the ECOG randomized trial
confirmed the increased median survival associated
with M-VAC, the long-term survival of approximately
5% was clearly disappointing.13
Two strategies were evaluated in randomized
trials to try to improve chemotherapy benefits over
those reported with M-VAC: increasing drug delivery
of the M-VAC regimen and testing entirely new
agents. The former strategy involved rapidly recycling
M-VAC therapy at 2-week intervals using neutrophil
growth factor support (termed high-dose M-VAC).
Although this approach improved drug delivery and
dose intensity, it failed to improve survival when
compared with conventional M-VAC.14,15 The second
strategy examined drugs found to have single-agent
activity in UC (such as docetaxel and gemcitabine),
and tested them in combination with cisplatin. The
combination of docetaxel and cisplatin was found to

1285

be inferior to M-VAC.16 In contrast, a phase 3 trial
comparing M-VAC with the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) was largely successful. This
trial demonstrated a similar efficacy with RRs of 49%
versus 46%, an identical time to disease progression
(7.4 months in both arms), and similar median survivals (14.8 months vs 13.8 months) in the M-VAC and
GC arms, respectively, and therefore failed to reach
its primary objective of detecting a 33% difference
between the treatment arms. Patients in the GC arm
also experienced less neutropenia, mucositis, and
neutropenic fever.17 Similar efficacy with less toxicity
in favor of the GC arm as well as evidence of longterm survival were confirmed at the time of 5-year
follow-up.18 On the basis of these data demonstrating
comparable activity with far less toxicity, GC has
largely replaced M-VAC as the standard first-line
therapy for patients with metastatic bladder cancer.
Poor renal function limits the ability to use cisplatin-based regimens in patients with UC. The median age for patients with bladder cancer is 68 years
and a declining glomerular filtration rate occurs as
part of the normal physiology of aging. In addition,
many of these patients have concomitant medical
illnesses, such as vascular disease and diabetes mellitus, which further compromise renal function.
Three small phase 2 trials comparing cisplatin with
carboplatin reported similar overall RRs (ORRs),
with less toxicity noted in the carboplatin arms.19-21
A European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) phase 3 trial of M-VAC versus carboplatin and paclitaxel closed early because
of poor accrual.22 Trials of carboplatin-based regimens in patients with normal renal function have
demonstrated encouraging ORRs in the range of
30% to 40%, but the CR rates are lower and they are
paralleled by shorter median survivals of 8 months
to 10 months.23,24 These results appear inferior to
those noted with M-VAC or GC, and therefore carboplatin should not be routinely substituted for cisplatin in patients who can receive cisplatin-based
chemotherapy.
In an effort to improve clinical outcomes, triplet
chemotherapy regimens have been investigated. The
first study reported a median survival time of 20
months for the regimen of ifosfamide, paclitaxel, and
cisplatin,25 but was not pursued in a randomized
trial. In a pair of phase 2 studies of gemcitabine and
paclitaxel with either cisplatin or carboplatin, the
overall survival was 15.6 months and 14.7 months,
respectively.26,27 The former regimen of paclitaxel,
cisplatin, and gemcitabine (PCG) was recently tested
against the GC regimen in a randomized trial by the
EORTC.28 This large, multicenter, phase 3 study of

1286

CANCER

greater than 600 patients demonstrated that PCG
provided a better ORR compared with GC in patients
with locally advanced and metastatic UC, and that
the median survival with PCG was 2.9 months longer
than with GC. However, the trial design, which was
testing for a 4-month difference in median survival,
indicated no significant difference in the duration of
either progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival. It is interesting to note that patients with bladder primary tumors appeared to fare better with the
triplet regimen. Thus, based on the lack of substantial clinical improvement, the PCG triplet combination be recommended for routine use, and GC
remains the standard of care.

Prognostic Factors
A prognostic factor–based model of survival was
developed based on 203 patients from 5 clinical trials
who were treated with M-VAC for unresectable or
metastatic UC.29 The presence of a Karnofsky performance status <80 or visceral (lung, liver, or bone)
metastasis was found to have an impact on survival,
with median survival times for patients with 0, 1, or
2 of these risk factors reported at 33.0 months, 13.4
months, and 9.3 months, respectively. This model
may be used in clinical trials to stratify patients
according to the number of risk factors for trials
evaluating chemotherapy in the first-line setting. It
has also been confirmed in an independent study of
patients receiving the PCG triplet,30 but it is unclear
whether the same clinical features have prognostic
capability in the second-line setting. Although one
might expect performance status and visceral metastasis to remain important factors, other factors may
impact the response to second-line therapy, such as:
1) whether a patient responded to first-line chemotherapy; 2) the duration of time between first-line
treatment and disease recurrence31; 3) prior exposure
to cisplatin; and 4) whether chemotherapy was administered in the perioperative or metastatic setting.32
In the second-line setting, evidence-based practice
stems from the results of small phase 2 studies with
differences in outcome due in part to differences in
patient characteristics between studies, indicating
that caution is needed when interpreting results.
Second-line Single-agent Therapy
Several chemotherapeutic agents have been studied
in the second-line setting in UC. In general, RRs
were low, and median survival times were modest.
Evidence for benefit was limited to phase 2 studies;
unfortunately, to our knowledge randomized trials
have not been reported to demonstrate a survival
benefit for chemotherapy compared with supportive

care alone. Despite the limitations of these small
phase 2 studies, valuable information has been
obtained, particularly the finding that response in
the second-line setting is much less frequent than in
initial chemotherapy. This phenomenon is expected
because it has been observed in many other malignancies. Phase 3 data in the colorectal cancer model
provide an excellent example of this phenomenon,33
in which previously untreated patients were randomized to receive 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin with
either irinotecan or oxaliplatin. At the time of disease
progression, irinotecan or oxaliplatin was replaced by
the alternative agent. First-line response rates were
nearly identical (56% vs 54%); as second-line treatment, response rates declined to 15% with the
change to oxaliplatin and 4% with the change to irinotecan. A similar pattern is evident in the phase 2
data for single agents studied in UC (Table 1).
Several older agents have been studied in
patients with recurrent UC, and among these, only
ifosfamide was found to have sufficient activity to
warrant its inclusion in combination chemotherapy.
Topotecan, pyrazoloacridine, piritrexim, and oxaliplatin all failed to demonstrate substantial activity.34-37
Ifosfamide, the oxazophosphorine analogue of cyclophosphamide, is active in patients with both transitional cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma
histologies. The ECOG evaluated ifosfamide as second-line therapy in 56 evaluable patients with UC;
there were 5 CRs and 6 partial responses (PRs) (20%;
95% confidence interval [95% CI], 10%-32%).38
The taxanes have demonstrated modest activity
in UC, with both docetaxel and paclitaxel found to
have substantial activity when used as single agents
in previously untreated patients. An ECOG phase 2
trial in 26 patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC evaluated first-line therapy with paclitaxel
by 24-hour continuous infusion administered every
21 days. Eleven of 26 (42%) patients demonstrated
an objective response, with 7 achieving a CR.39 Similarly, in the first-line setting, docetaxel administered
on a 3-week schedule achieved an ORR of 31%.39
As expected, second-line studies of taxanes in
patients with UC report lower RRs than noted in
chemotherapy-naive patients. Thirty patients who
failed to respond or developed disease recurrence after
1 prior cisplatin-based regimen were treated with
docetaxel every 21 days. Four of 30 (13.3%) patients
achieved a PR in lymph nodes or soft tissue; the estimated median duration of survival for all patients
was 9 months (median follow-up of 14 months).
Myelosuppression was frequent, and dose reductions
for adverse events were needed in 18 (60%)
patients.40 Weekly paclitaxel was evaluated in 31

patients with progressive UC who had received 1
prior systemic chemotherapy regimen.41 Three (10%)
patients achieved a PR with a median time to disease
progression of 2.2 months and a median overall survival of 7.2 months.
Similar to taxanes, the epothilones are a class of
agents that competitively bind to microtubules and
inhibit microtubule dynamics. Interestingly, specific
mutations associated with paclitaxel resistance may
not confer epothilone resistance, suggesting that resistance to epothilones may be independent of taxane resistance. The ECOG evaluated the epothilone
analog BMS-247550 in patients with recurrent UC at
a dose of 40 mg/m2 over 3 hours administered every
3 weeks in 45 patients, 17 of whom had received
prior taxanes.42 Twelve patients experienced grade 4
toxicity, and 1 died of cardiac failure. Five patients (3
previously treated with a taxane-containing regimen)
obtained a PR (12%). The median PFS was 2.7
months (95% CI, 1.8 months-4.1 months), and the
median overall survival was 8 months (95% CI, 4.9
months-9.8 months). The recommendation by the
investigators was not to pursue further study of this
drug in patients with UC.
Gemcitabine has been studied extensively at
different doses and schedules in both previously
treated and untreated patients, illustrating the complexity in interpreting the results. Of the 3 trials in

untreated patients, an ORR of 45.5% was demonstrated with a dose of 1200 mg/m2 on a 3-week
schedule.43 In 2 other studies, the same dose on
Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 4-week schedule resulted in a
28% ORR and a median OS of 13.5 months44 and a
24% ORR and median OS of 8 months, respectively.45 A reduced dose of gemcitabine at 1000 mg/
m2 on the same schedule led to a 29% ORR and a
median OS that exceeded 13 months.46 Three studies have investigated gemcitabine in the secondline setting. A phase 1 study of 15 patients, 14 of
whom had previously received M-VAC, reported an
encouraging 27% ORR with doses ranging from 875
to 1370 mg/m2.47 Two phase 2 studies evaluating
gemcitabine at a dose of 1250 mg/m2 on a 4-week
and 3-week schedule revealed a 23% ORR and an
11% ORR, respectively.48,49 The pooled ORR from
the 192 patients treated on these 7 studies was
25%; however, the variable responses and different
doses and schedules used make it difficult to identify the optimal dose and schedule of gemcitabine.50 In contrast to the taxanes, it is unclear from
these studies whether gemcitabine is less active in
the second-line compared with the first-line setting.
On the basis of the activity of other antifolates in
UC, it is not surprising that pemetrexed, a multitargeted antifolate, is active as well. Paz-Ares et al to
our knowledge were the first to report the activity of

1288

pemetrexed in UC, in which the trial started at a
dose of 600 mg/m2, but with a reduction to 500 mg/
m2 after observing unacceptable toxicity in the first 6
patients.51 On an intent-to-treat basis, 29% (95% CI,
14%-48%) of patients achieved an objective response.
There were 3 early deaths, which the authors partially attributed to the lack of vitamin supplementation. Investigators quickly found that the addition of
folic acid and vitamin B12 markedly decreased the
incidence of toxicity while maintaining efficacy. A
subsequent multicenter study led by Indiana University reported the use of pemetrexed in previously
treated patients who received pemetrexed at the
approved dose of 500 mg/m2 every 21 days; all
patients received vitamin B12, folic acid, and dexamethasone prophylaxis.52 Of the 47 patients on the
trial, 3 (6.4%) achieved a CR and 10 (21.3%) achieved
a PR, for an ORR of 27.7% (95% CI, 15.6%-42.6%).
The median OS was 9.8 months (95% CI, 5.1
months-14.6 months). A third trial of pemetrexed in
UC was performed by investigators at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), using the
same dose of 500 mg/m2 every 21 days with standard
folate and B12 prophylaxis.53 A total of 13 patients
were enrolled, but an objective response was noted
in only 1 of 12 evaluable patients, for an ORR of 8%
(95% CI, 0%-29%). The trial was discontinued
because this level of activity did not meet the
requirements of the optimal 2-stage Simon design.
One can conclude that all 3 trials independently confirm modest single-agent activity based on the overlapping 95% confidence limits or ORR observed in
each trial.
Vinflunine has demonstrated superior antitumor
activity with reduced neurotoxicity in numerous in
vivo tumor models when compared with other vinca
alkaloids, including vinblastine, vincristine, and
vinorelbine.54 In a proof of principle study, the preclinical assessment of vinflunine demonstrated clear
cytotoxic activity in the murine MB-49 bladder cancer cell line.55 Vinflunine was thus a logical candidate to study in UC. The first trial was initiated at a
dose of 350 mg/m2, but the toxicity profile after the
initial 6 patients warranted a dose reduction to 320
mg/m2 for the remaining 51 patients; the majority of
patients had developed disease recurrence or progression within 12 months of initial chemotherapy.
Nine of 51 patients achieved a PR for an ORR of 18%
(95% CI, 8.4%-30.9%). Five of the 9 responses noted
in this trial were at sites of visceral metastases, with
several responses reported in the lung and liver.31
Objective response rates were noted in 8 of 34 (24%)
patients previously treated in the metastatic setting,
and 1 of 17 (6%) patients treated in the neoadjuvant

or adjuvant setting. The median duration of response
was 9.1 months (95% CI, 4.2 months-15.0 months),
the median PFS was 3.0 months (95% CI, 2.4
months-3.8 months), and the median OS was 6.6
months (95% CI, 4.8 months-7.6 months). Grade 3 of
4 neutropenia was observed in 67% of patients; however, 5 (10%) patients experienced febrile neutropenia. No grade 3 of 4 sensory neuropathy or renal
function impairment was reported. Grade 3 of 4 constipation was observed in 8% of patients, and grade
3 nausea and vomiting was observed in 4% and 6%
of patients, respectively.31
In a larger phase 2 study, vinflunine was administered to 150 patients with platinum-refractory UC.
Patients with prior pelvic irradiation, who were aged
75 years, had a Karnofsky performance status of 90
or 80, or had renal impairment (creatinine clearance
60 mL/min) received a dose of 280 mg/m2; all
other patients received a dose of 320 mg/m2. Interim
data from 114 patients (150 planned) indicated an
ORR of 14.9%, and the median duration of response
was 6.8 months (95% CI, 5.6 months-9.5 months).
Forty-eight (42%) patients had stable disease. Myelosuppression was noted with grade 3 of 4 neutropenia
(59%), anemia (17%), and thrombocytopenia (4%).
Febrile neutropenia occurred in 8 (7%) patients.
Grade 3 of 4 constipation (14%) and fatigue (11%)
were also noted. There was a low incidence of peripheral sensory neuropathy; grade 3 paresthesia was
observed in 1 (0.1%) patient.56

Combination Chemotherapy
Multidrug combinations have been investigated in
previously treated patients with metastatic UC;
response rates are variable, yet generally higher than
those noted with single agents. However, a higher
response rate does not necessarily translate into an
improvement in OS, and toxicity can be substantial
in the previously treated patient population. A survey
of all the studies of combination chemotherapy in
the second-line setting is beyond the scope of this
review; however, 2 studies using the combination of
gemcitabine and paclitaxel illustrated the difficulty in
interpreting the literature. Both studies used different
doses and different schedules, and were conducted
in diverse previously treated patient populations. In
1 study, patients were treated with 21-day cycles of
gemcitabine (at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 on Days 1
and 8) and paclitaxel (at a dose of 175 mg/m2 on
Day 1) or a 14-day cycle of gemcitabine (at a dose of
1250 mg/m2 on Day 1) and paclitaxel (at a dose of
120 mg/m2 on Day 2).57 The ORR for all 30 patients
was 44%, but the median survival was greater for the

Second-line Therapy for Bladder Cancer/Gallagher et al

21-day schedule (13 months vs 9 months, respectively). A second study reported on an every-otherweek regimen of gemcitabine (2500 to 3000 mg/m2)
and paclitaxel (150 mg/m2) in 40 patients who had
previously received M-VAC in the perioperative or
metastatic setting, with a median OS of 8 months
and 12 months, respectively.58 These observations
raise the question of whether efficacy was related to
the combination or related instead to the timing of
the prior chemotherapy (either neoadjuvant/adjuvant
or for metastatic disease), statistical chance because
of small numbers, or the doses and treatment schedule. In the latter study, grade 3 of 4 neutropenia
occurred in 32% of patients, 3 patients developed
febrile neutropenia, and 1 died from gastrointestinal
bleeding and neutropenic sepsis. This trial’s reported
toxicity illustrates the increased adverse effects and
uncertain survival benefit for combination chemotherapy, and why many treating physicians prefer
single-agent treatment in the second-line, noncurative setting.

Targeted Therapy in UC
Conventional chemotherapeutic agents have been
successfully used in UC but, as our understanding of
tumor biology increases, there is a growing interest
in targeted, pathway-based therapies. Several molecular pathways have been shown to play a role in the
biology of UC and are therefore an area of therapeutic opportunity. Two receptor tyrosine kinases, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and erb-B2
(HER-2) are often overexpressed in invasive UC. In 9
patients with UC who were treated with trastuzumab,
a monoclonal antibody that targets HER-2, no
responses were noted. This may be related to the low
incidence of erb-B2 gene amplification in UC, an important predictor of response in patients with breast
cancer.59 Another study investigating the combination of paclitaxel, carboplatin, gemcitabine, and trastuzumab reported a 73% RR in 32 HER-2–positive
patients (by immunohistochemistry 51%, fluorescence in situ hybridization in 13%, and serology in
12%).60 Despite the high RR, these study results were
disappointing, in that the survival was similar to this
combination without the trastuzumab. Gefitinib, an
oral EGFR antagonist, was combined with GC in 55
chemotherapy-naive patients with locally advanced
or metastatic UC; the combination achieved a RR of
51% and a median OS of 14.4 months, which are
very similar to those obtained with GC alone, suggesting that gefitinib does not add substantially to
the efficacy of GC.61

1289

To our knowledge, there is limited experience
with targeted agents in previously treated patients
with UC; the reports on a pair of phase 2 studies
have been disappointing.62,63 There were no significant responses noted among 20 patients treated with
the proteosome inhibitor bortezomib, and there were
only 2 PRs reported among 59 patients treated with
lapatinib, an erb-B2 and EGFR dual tyrosine kinase
inhibitor.
Tumor angiogenesis also appears to play a major
role in the development of bladder cancer and holds
potential promise clinically. Microvessel density, a
histologic marker of angiogenesis, has been associated with poor prognosis in patients with UC.64
High vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
mRNA expression and high serum VEGF levels are
also reported to be poor prognostic indicators.65,66
MSKCC investigators recently reported the early
results of the clinical activity of sunitinib in previously treated patients.67 A second study from Spain
recently confirmed this activity in the first-line setting, and final results from both studies are
awaited.68 Because sunitinib reportedly has a substantial impact on time to disease progression in
other malignancies, the University of Michigan has
launched a randomized phase 2 trial evaluating the
role of sunitinib as maintenance therapy immediately after first-line chemotherapy, testing time to
disease progression as the trial endpoint. The ECOG
has opened a phase 2 trial (E1804) of sorafenib in
patients with recurrent UC to determine the ORR
and 4-month PFS rate. The Princess Margaret Hospital and the National Cancer Institute of Canada are
performing a similar phase 2 study. Bevacizumab, a
monoclonal antibody that targets VEGF, is also under
study in patients with UC. An ongoing phase 2 trial
at MSKCC is evaluating the combination of gemcitabine, carboplatin, and bevacizumab in patients with
advanced UC who are unable to receive cisplatin
chemotherapy. The Cancer and Leukemia Group B
plans a phase 3 trial of GC plus bevacizumab versus
GC plus placebo in patients tolerant of cisplatin.
Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) is a
small-molecule inhibitor of histone deacetylase
(HDAC) that binds directly to the enzyme’s active
site and inhibits purified HDAC activity. HDAC inhibition suppresses the growth of bladder cancer cell
lines in culture and in mice bearing EJ and UM-UC3 bladder xenografts.69 The California/Pittsburgh
Cancer Consortium is conducting a phase 2 study of
SAHA in patients with advanced UC. The Southwest
Oncology Group is also conducting a phase 2 study
(SWOG 0400) of depsipeptide, another HDAC inhibitor, in previously treated UC patients.

Measuring Response in Clinical Trials
The majority of published trials in patients with
advanced UC use either the World Health Organization or Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) criteria to assess response. Both systems
measure the anatomic size of lesions and define
response as a change in the size of the lesion beyond
a certain threshold. The boundaries in each system
are different and were arbitrarily chosen. Both methods of evaluating response may not be optimal for
many of the newer agents, in which functional
changes are observed in the absence of anatomic
changes. Many of the newer targeted therapies are
cytostatic or inhibit angiogenesis, and stable disease
may be the most appropriate endpoint. Stable disease lasting 3 months has been reported in 27% of
patients treated with sunitinib for metastatic renal
cell cancer, leading to its approval for treatment.70
Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography imaging can only be used if the lesions are
FDG avid at baseline. To our knowledge to date, limited data are available and FDG-PET cannot be
recommended for widespread use and is still considered investigational.71
The treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors
(GISTs) offers an excellent example of the difficulties
encountered when measuring response to newer
agents. GISTs can increase in size because of intratumoral hemorrhage or myxoid degeneration representing a response to treatment. In addition,
intratumoral solid components may increase without
an overall increase in the size of the target lesion.72
Choi et al incorporated tumor density into a model
to measure response of GISTs to imatinib, and found
that this was a reliable and useful indicator of
response.73 These criteria are currently being evaluated in a multicenter study. The advanced capabilities of modern computed tomography and magnetic
resonance imaging may overcome the shortcomings
of RECIST. In addition to functional imaging, molecular techniques including molecular imaging probes
and image-based biomarkers are currently under
active investigation.74
Challenges for Clinical Research in UC
Poor accrual has been the main obstacle to clinical
research in UC, due partially to a lower incidence of
disease when compared with other diseases, but
additional factors also contribute. Whereas clinical
trials are frequently offered to patients with more
common cancers, such as breast, lung, and colon
cancer, trials in UC are often overlooked by patients
and physicians in favor of approved therapies. This is
particularly true in the first-line setting. Enrollment

in clinical trials for previously treated patients is better than for chemotherapy-naive patients. Having
received more than 1 prior therapy often makes
these patients ineligible for second-line clinical trials,
because most study criteria are restricted to 1 prior
regimen. Furthermore, patients with UC belong to an
older age group, and the presence of medical comorbidities can exclude their participation in clinical
research.

Conclusions
Advances in systemic chemotherapy have improved
the duration and the quality of life for patients with
UC. Despite this progress, the median survival for
patients with advanced UC has plateaued over the
past 2 decades and remains at approximately 1 year.
Although cure is possible in a small subset of
patients, long-term survival rates remain very poor.
RRs in the second-line setting are modest, and the
trials typically have few patients, underscoring the
finding that no single agent has been approved by
the US Food and Drug Administration for recurrent
UC after primary chemotherapy. Single-agent therapy
is most frequently used in this setting, and several
single agents have response rates between 10% and
20%. However, to our knowledge long-term benefits
or even a survival advantage over supportive care
alone have not been demonstrated to date. Agents
currently under study hold some promise based on
either early reported clinical benefits or rational UC
biology. In the interim, recurrent UC is a malignancy
for which improvement in treatment options is
urgently needed, and patients should be offered participation in clinical trials.
