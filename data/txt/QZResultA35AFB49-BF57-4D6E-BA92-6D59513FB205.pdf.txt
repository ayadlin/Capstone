BACKGROUND: Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL), nasal-type, is a distinct entity of lymphoid tissue.
ENKTL is sensitive to radiotherapy (RT), but the prognosis is poorer than for other types of early lymphoma. The
treatment schedule is controversial. METHODS: A phase 2 study was conducted of ‘‘sandwich’’ protocols, with earlier
RT after an initial 2 to 3 cycles of LVP (L-asparaginase, vincristine, and prednisone), followed by further ‘‘consolidation’’ cycles. Patients aged 18 years and older who had previously untreated ENKTL and localized lesions in the upper
aerodigestive tract were enrolled. The primary endpoints were objective response rate and complete remission rate.
The secondary endpoints were 2-year overall survival, 2-year progression-free survival, and toxicity. This study is registered with www.Chictr.org, number ChicTR-TNC-00000394, and is ongoing for long-term follow-up. RESULTS:
Twenty-six patients completed total therapy, which resulted in 88.5% response that included 21 patients (80.8%) with
complete response (CR) and 2 patients (7.7%) with partial response. Three (11.5%) of 26 patients progressed during
therapy. With a median follow-up of 27 months (range, 4-35 months), the 2-year overall survival was 88.5%, and the
2-year progression-free survival was 80.6%. Patients with CR had better prognosis than patients without CR. Only 2
patients (7.7%) experienced grade 3 leukocytopenia. No grade 4 toxicity or treatment-related deaths were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The research showed that the ‘‘sandwich’’ protocol of LVP combined with RT was a safe and effective treatment for localized nasal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, and the results warrant further investigation into this

Extranodal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL), nasal-type, is a distinct entity according to World

Health Organization classification of tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues. It has an incidence of <1% of all
lymphomas in Western countries1 and accounts for 7% to 10% of lymphomas in East Asia and Latin America.2,3 Up to
75% of patients have stage I or II disease in the nasal cavity and its adjacent sites.4,5 ENKTL is sensitive to radiotherapy
(RT), but the prognosis is poorer than for other types of early lymphoma.6-8 Reported 5-year overall survival (OS) for
patients with localized nasal ENKTL who are treated with RT alone has been shown to range from 35% to 66%.9-12
Moreover, 5-year OS for these patients treated with CHOP-like chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone/prednisolone) followed by involved-field RT is less than 50%.11,13-15

LVP and RT for Nasal NK/T-Cell Lymphoma/Jiang et al

Some nonanthracycline regimens, such as L-asparaginase, cisplatin, ifosfamide, methotrexate, and etoposide,
are known to be effective in improving overall response
rates (ORR) and survival.16 At present, concurrent chemoradiotherapy with some nonanthracycline regimens is
recommended for treatment of nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma.17 In particular, L-asparaginase–based chemotherapy has shown a remarkable effect even in relapsed and
refractory disease, with an ORR of 67% to 86% and a
complete remission (CR) rate of 46% to 55.6%.18-21
Until now, there has been no report of its use in the treatment of newly diagnosed localized ENKTL.
Several retrospective studies have suggested that early
or ‘‘up-front’’ RT improves the ORR and OS.9,12,22-24
‘‘Sandwich’’ protocols, with earlier RT after an initial 2 to 3
cycles of chemotherapy followed by further ‘‘consolidation’’
cycles of chemotherapy, improve the control of both local
and systemic disease. These protocols are feasible treatment
options for several kinds of tumors, but are not the usual
practice in local ENKTL. To explore a more effective therapeutic strategy for newly diagnosed, localized ENKTL, we
conducted a phase 2 study of ‘‘sandwich’’ LVP (L-asparaginase, vincristine, and prednisone) and RT. This study
examines the efficacy and tolerance of this protocol.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Criteria
To be eligible for enrollment, patients had to have the following characteristics: previously untreated ENKTL,
nasal type, as defined by the World Health Organization
classification,25 with primary site in the upper aerodigestive tract; be at least 18 years of age; have disease classified
as Ann Arbor stage IE or IIE; and have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0
to 2. Patients also had to have adequate hematologic function (ie, hemoglobin >9.0 g/L, absolute neutrophil count
>1500/lL, and platelets >100,000/lL), hepatic function
(ie, total bilirubin 2 times the upper limit of normal, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase
levels 2.5 times the upper limit of normal), renal function (ie, serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL, creatinine clearance  50 mL/minute), and normal electrocardiogram
results. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy or lactation,
and any coexisting medical problems of sufficient severity
to prevent full compliance with the study protocol.
Patients with ENKTL not located in upper aerodigestive
tract sites, such as in skin or the gastrointestinal tract, were
excluded. All patients provided written informed consent.

approved by the ethics committee. (ChicTR-TNC00000394)

Treatment and Dose Modifications
Chemotherapy was started within 7 days after registration.
The LVP doses and administration schedule were as follows: L-asparaginase 6000 IU/m2 given intravenously on
days 1 through 5, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 given intravenously on day 1, and prednisone 100 mg given orally on
days 1 through 5. Chemotherapy was repeated every 3
weeks. After 2 cycles of chemotherapy, RT was started,
and then chemotherapy was given for 2 to 4 cycles at 1
week after the completion of RT. If a patient developed
grade 4 hematologic toxicity, doses of L-asparaginase were
decreased by two-thirds for all following cycles. All drugs
were administered only if the absolute neutrophil count
was >1500/lL and the platelet count was >75,000/lL
before each cycle. Two units of L-asparaginase was carried
out according to the instructions for skin test. LVP was
replaced by a CHOP regimen if the skin test was positive,
and was reintroduced if the skin test was negative in the
next cycle. The total number of cycles includes the
CHOP regimen. The definition of a positive skin test is
according to descriptions in the drug prescribing information, and manifests as skin redness, itching, and swelling.
Sudden onset of wheezing, itching, rash, face swelling,
agitation, and low blood pressure are judged to be an allergic reaction and prohibit further use of this drug.
All patients were treated with a photon beam of 6
MV. Three-dimensional conformal treatment planning
was used. The clinical target volume (CTV) of limited
stage IE disease included the nasal cavity, bilateral frontal
ethmoid sinuses, and the ipsilateral maxillary sinus. For
patients with extensive stage IE disease, CTV was
extended to the involved organs and/or tissues. For stage
IIE disease, CTV also included the affected cervical lymph
node area. The planning target volume included the CTV
with a 5 mm margin. Supplementary doses of radiation in
the ethmoid sinus and cervical lymph nodes were supplied
by an electron beam. The RT prescription was 56 Gy in
28 fractions, once a day, and 5 fractions every week. RT
was postponed until the toxicity was reduced to grade 2 if
one or more of the following adverse events were
observed: grade 4 leukopenia or neutropenia, platelet
count <25,000/lL, any grade 3 nonhematologic toxicities except for mucositis or dysphagia related to radiation,
and/or ECOG performance status  3.

Evaluation
Baseline evaluations were performed 14 days before
enrollment. Pretreatment clinical investigations included
history taking, physical examination, complete blood
count, serum biochemistry with lactate dehydrogenase,
bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy, endoscopic
examination of the nasal and oral cavities by nasopharyngeal endoscopy, computed tomography and/or magnetic
resonance imaging of the head and neck, and computed
tomography of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis. The cases
were staged according to the Cotswold modification of
the Ann Arbor staging system. All these examinations
were repeated before RT, at the end of treatment, and every 3 months thereafter to monitor disease progression.
We calculated the international prognostic index and the
NK/T-cell lymphoma prognostic index, which includes
the presence of ‘‘B’’ symptoms, lesions at stages III or IV,
elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase concentration, and
lymph node involvement.26
Treatment response was assessed according to standardized response criteria for non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas.27 The primary endpoints were CR and ORR, which
was calculated as the proportion of patients classified as
having CR or partial response (PR). The secondary endpoints were 2-year OS and 2-year progression-free survival (PFS), and toxicity, which were evaluated according
to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
Criteria of Adverse Events, version 3.0.
Statistical Analysis
The study was designed as a trial with a 1-sided hypothesis
that the ‘‘sandwich’’ protocol is superior to the historical
control. Retrospective studies have shown that the CR
rate for CHOP and CHOP-like chemotherapy with RT
for untreated, localized nasal I/II ENKTL was approximately 50%.28 The hypothesis was proposed because the
‘‘sandwich’’ protocol was expected to have a CR rate of
approximately 80%, and thus would be more effective
than the historical control. The required sample size was
26 eligible patients for an 80% power to detect a difference with a type I error of 0.05. The planned sample size
was 29 patients, with the expectation that 10% would be
ineligible.
Survival estimates were calculated using the KaplanMeier method. In subgroup analyses, survival curves were
compared by the log-rank test. A 2-sided P value of <.05
was considered significant. All analyses were performed
using SPSS Statistics, version 13.0, software (SPSS, Chicago, Ill).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
A total of 26 patients from West China Hospital of
Sichuan University were enrolled in the study from July
2008 to November 2009, and all patients completed
treatment according to the schedule. The characteristics
of the patients are summarized in Table 1. All patients
were in the low or low/intermediate risk categories according to the international prognostic index, and 8 patients
were classified as group III or IV according to the NK/Tcell lymphoma prognostic index.26
Response
A total of 106 cycles of chemotherapy were carried out,
including 98 cycles of LVP and 8 cycles of CHOP. All
patients completed the RT. After the first 2 cycles of
chemotherapy, the ORR was 92%, which included 11
cases with CR and 13 cases with PR, whereas the disease
was stable for 2 patients. After RT and subsequent chemotherapy, 11 patients remained in CR, 10 patients with PR
achieved CR, 2 patients remained in PR, and 1 patient
was found with bone marrow infiltration. At the end of
treatment, the ORR was 88.5%, including 21 patients
with CR (80.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 65.62%95.92%) and 2 with PR (7.7%). For 3 patients (11.5%),
the disease progressed during therapy (Figure 1).
Relapse and Survival
The median follow-up time for the 26 patients was 27
months (range, 4-35 months). During the therapy and
follow-up period, 5 of 26 patients (19.2%) experienced
disease progression. Three patients progressed during
therapy: 2 had bone marrow infiltration and died approximately 1 month later, and 1 patient had a new lesion in
the skin of the right thigh, which was treated with the
GDP (gemcitabine, cisplatin, and dexamethasone) regimen; the patient was still surviving at 19 months of
follow-up. Another 2 patients experienced disease progression in the follow-up period: in 1 patient, a new lesion
was found in the skin of his left hip 12 months after the
end of treatment. He was treated with the GDP chemotherapy regimen and RT but experienced systemic progress and died 29 months after diagnosis. The other
patient, who was still in partial remission at the end of
treatment, experienced disease progression in the oropharynx area outside the border of the radiation field 2 months
after the end of treatment, and died from bleeding of the
tumor during second-line chemotherapy. All other
patients are being followed. At the time of this report, the

Toxicity
Chemotherapy was well tolerated. The most common
adverse event was a positive reaction to the L-asparaginase
skin test. The skin test was positive in 23.1% of patients
and 7.5% of cycles. Four patients followed the CHOP
regimen instead of LVP for only 1 cycle, because the skin
test was positive; these patients finished the other cycles
with LVP smoothly during follow-up treatment. Two
patients used the CHOP regimen for 2 cycles. One
patient with negative skin test had skin rashes in most
cycles of LVP, but this was relieved after intravenous
injection of calcium and oral administration of loratadine.
Nonhematologic toxicities were minimal, and most toxicities were grade 1, comprising mainly nausea, vomiting,
and abnormal liver function. Hematologic toxicity was
tolerable; grade 3 toxicities developed in only 2 patients
(7.7%) with leukocytopenia but without fever and infection. No patients suffered from the following problems:
pancreatitis, elevated glucose level, or blood clotting disorder because of receiving L-asparaginase.
Mucositis and dermatitis were common during RT,
but most cases were grade 1 and 2; the grade 3 mucositis
and dermatitis rates were 23.1% and 11.5%, respectively.
No patient experienced grade 4 side effects during RT.
There were no grade 4 toxicity or treatment-related
deaths. Details of side effects are listed in Table 2.

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, there are no relevant reports about
‘‘sandwich’’ LVP and RT for untreated, localized nasal
ENKTL. The CR rate for CHOP-like chemotherapy
alone has been shown to be <40%,13,22,23,29-31 with a 5year failure-free survival ranging from 25% to 40%.5,32
The mechanisms of ENKTL resistance to anthracycline
may be related to the high expression of P-glycoprotein by
lymphoma cells.33 L-Asparaginase acting as an antitumor
agent could block the supply of asparagine, which cannot
be synthesized by ENKTL tumor cells, thus causing death
of the tumor. L-Asparaginase–based chemotherapy had a
remarkable effect on relapsed and refractory ENKTL.18-21
It has been reported that a patient with multiple subcutaneous lesions ENKTL who was treated with L-asparaginase combined with vincristine and prednisolone received
CR lasting longer than 2 years.21 In this study, we used Lasparaginase in combination with vincristine and prednisone. The ORR was 92%, and the CR rate was 46% in all
patients and 76.9% in those limited to stage IE after the
first 2 cycles of LVP chemotherapy. LVP regimens

showed remarkable antitumor activity for untreated stages
I/II of ENKTL.
RT and chemotherapy are both important for treatment of localized ENKTL, but the optimal dose, combination, and sequence are still undefined. A number of
studies have been carried out to address this. A prospective
trial with concurrent RT (50 Gy) and 3 courses of DeVIC
(dexamethasone, etoposide, ifosfamide, and carboplatin)

achieved a CR rate of 77% and an 81% ORR, with a 2year OS rate of 78%.34 In another study with concurrent
RT and weekly cisplatin followed by VIPD (etoposide,
ifosfamide, cisplatin, and dexamethasone) chemotherapy,
the ORR and the CR rate were 83.3% and 80.0%, respectively, and the 3-year OS rate was 86.28%.35 In our study,
we performed a ‘‘sandwich’’ protocol and achieved an
encouraging response rate: the ORR was 88.5% (23 of 26

described above.
The dose of RT is still controversial in treatment of
ENKTL. A previous study suggested that radiation doses
of >54 Gy might be required to obtain in-field control in
patients with localized ENKTL,24 but other trials have
recommended a dose <50 Gy.10,36,37 An increase in the
dose of RT might improve local control but could
decrease the tolerance to treatment. The radiation dose of
56 Gy in our study achieved a 92.3% (24 of 26 patients)
CR rate, and no local relapse occurred in the radiation
field during the follow-up period. Moreover, we used 3dimensional conformal RT, and radiation toxicities were
tolerated.
LVP chemotherapy was well tolerated in our study.

grade 3 toxicity developed in only 2 (7.7%) patients who
had leukocytopenia, but without fever, infection, or dose
modification. However, hematologic toxicity in the above
2 studies was common, with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia of
62% and 91%, respectively; fever and infection were also
common in those studies.34,35 Although the rate of a positive skin test in our study was a little higher, no side effects
associated with allergy were found.
In this study, the 2-year OS is 88.5%, and the 2-year
PFS is 80.6%. The induction of CR strongly affected
both OS and PFS rates. Patients who did not achieve CR
after treatment usually progressed after a short time,
which means the CR rate may be higher, and OS may be
greater (Figure 3). Although the survival benefit should be
demonstrated in a randomized, phase 3 study, it is not feasible to conduct a randomized study because ENKTL is a
rare disease.

Original Article

This study is the first prospective study of ‘‘sandwich’’ LVP and RT for untreated, localized nasal NK/Tcell lymphoma. This treatment protocol produced a significant short-term curative rate and was generally well
tolerated, with particularly mild hematologic side effects.
Because the follow-up time was relatively short and the
sample size was small, we cannot definitely state that this
model is the best model, and further study is warranted.
