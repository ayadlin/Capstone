Abstract

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) often features the up-regulation of the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh)
pathway leading to activation of Gli transcription factors. SCLC cells secrete bombesin (BBS)-like
neuropeptides (BLPs) that act as autocrine growth factors. Here, we show that SCLC tumour
samples feature co-expression of Shh and BBS-cognate receptor (Gastrin-Releasing Peptide
Receptor: GRPR). We also demonstrate that BBS activates Gli in SCLC cells, which is crucial for
BBS-mediated SCLC proliferation because cyclopamine, an inhibitor of the Shh pathway,
hampered the BBS-mediated effects. BBS binding to GRPR stimulated Gli through its
downstream Gαq and Gα12/13 GTPases, and consistently, other Gαq and Gα13 coupled receptors
(such as muscarinic receptor, m1, and thrombin receptor, PAR-1) and constitutively active GαqQL
and Gα12/13QL mutants stimulated Gli. By using cells null for Gαq and Gα12/13, we demonstrate
that these G proteins are strictly necessary for Gli activation by BBS. Moreover, by using
constitutively active Rho small G-protein (Rho QL) as well as its inhibitor, C3 toxin, we show that
Rho mediates GPCR-, Gαq- and Gα12/13-dependent Gli stimulation. At the molecular level, BBS
caused a significant increase in Shh gene transcription and protein secretion that was dependent on
BBS-induced GPCR/Gαq-12/13/Rho mediated activation of NFκB, which can stimulate a NFκB
response element in the Shh gene promoter. Our data identify a novel molecular network acting in
SCLC linking autocrine BBS and Shh circuitries, and suggest Shh inhibitors as novel therapeutic
strategies against this aggressive cancer type.

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is one of the leading cause of cancer-related death in the Western countries.1
Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is a very aggressive, highly metastasizing and lethal lung
cancer type and it accounts for about 15% of all lung cancers.1 SCLC is regarded as a
neuroendocrine tumour because of its ability to synthesize various hormone peptides that
can act as paracrine and autocrine growth factors.2

Author Manuscript

The vertebrate family of hedgehog extracellular ligands is represented by three members:
Desert (Dhh), Indian (Ihh) and Sonic (Shh) hedgehog. Shh is the best-characterized family
member and it is involved in a wide variety of developmental events. In humans, Shh gene
is located on chromosome 7 (7q36) and its heterozygous mutations result in
holoprosencephaly.3 Shh signals are transduced, at the cell surface, by two transmembrane
proteins, Patched (Ptch) and Smoothened (Smo). Ptch is a 12-pass membrane protein that
binds directly to Shh ligands and inhibits Smo function. Smo is a 7-pass transmembrane
protein required to transduce the Shh signal. Shh/Ptch binding leads to the de-repression of
Smo. In turn, Smoregulates canonical (Gli dependent) signaling, resulting in activation of
the Gli transcription factor, and non canonical (Gli independent) signaling leading to
activation of heterotrimetic Gi and small GTPase RhoA proteins. Non canonical Shh
signaling is also activated independently of Smo, through Ptch regulation of cell survival.45

Author Manuscript

Shh binding to Ptch phenocopies the genetic loss of Ptch.6 In the absence of Ptch, Smo
constitutively activates Shh pathway.7 Shh acts both as a short-range and a long-range
diffusible morphogen and regulates epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in many organs.8 It
is expressed in the embryonic lung epithelium while Ptch is found in mesenchymal cells,
this system representing a model for epithelial-mesenchymal interaction in lung
development.9

Author Manuscript

Gain-of-function of Shh pathway is associated with many different tumours.10 The fact that
upregulation of Shh signalling occurs in familial cancer, such as basal cell carcinoma (BCC)
and medulloblastoma, indicates that it is sufficient to initiate tumour formation.11 Recent
findings demonstrate that deregulation of Shh signalling is also required for tumour
maintenance, as neoplastic cells depend on Shh activity for survival and proliferation.10
Based on the evidence that Shh pathway is an important regulator of lung development12
and that several tumors of neuroendocrine origin overexpress molecules of the Shh pathway,
Watkins and colleagues have found that SCLCs are dependent on Shh pathway for tumour
development and maintenance.13 Moreover, genetically engineered mice require Shh
signaling for SCLC initiation, progression, and tumor maintenance.14
SCLC derived cell lines require conditioned medium to grow in culture, suggesting that they
need autocrine/paracrine growth factors to proliferate.15, 16 These growth factors have been
identified as different neuropeptides. The prototypical neuropeptide secreted by SCLC cells

is Gastrin-Releasing Peptide (GRP), the mammalian homologue of the amphibian bombesin
(BBS).2, 17 GRP has a carboxyl-terminal peptide similar to that of BBS, and binds to the
same receptor as BBS. BBS/GRP receptor (GRPR) is a 7- transmembrane-spanning protein
that couples to heterotrimeric G proteins of the Gαq and Gα12/13 families. Since most of the
SCLC cells express not only GRP/BBS but also its cognate GRPR, GRP/BBS has been
recognized as autocrine growth factor for SCLC cells as it sustains cell proliferation,
survival, angiogenesis, local invasion and distant metastases.16, 18 The presence of this
receptor/ligand pair is regarded as a marker of tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis and
its inhibition represents an attractive target for SCLC therapy.2, 19 Here we demonstrate a
functional interaction between Shh and BBS pathways in SCLC.

RESULTS
Author Manuscript

BBS promotes proliferation of SCLC cells through Shh pathway

Author Manuscript

BBS functions as autocrine growth factor in SCLC cells cell growth.2 In order to test a
relationship between the BBS and the Shh pathways, we measured DNA synthesis rate of
H378 SCLC cells. As shown in figure 1A, BBS treatment increased DNA synthesis;
interestingly, this proliferative effect was sharply reduced when the cells were treated with
cyclopamine, a specific inhibitor of the Smo receptor6 (Fig. 1A). Soluble Shh (pSec-N-Shh)
(Supplementary Informations, Fig. S1) had a proliferative effect on H378 cells that was
abolished by cyclopamine, which hence served as an experimental control (Fig. 1A). To
confirm that other SCLC cells also responded to BBS and Shh stimulation, we cultured a
panel of different SCLC cell lines for 72 hours in the presence of BBS or Shh ligand and
counted total number of cells. Figure 1B shows that BBS and Shh increased number of
H209, H378 and H510A cells. Interestingly, other SCLC cells known to be negative for
bombesin-like immunoreactivity, H82 and H133916, 18-20 did not show the same response
(Fig. 1B).
Co-expression of Shh-Gli1 and GRPR in human SCLCs
To verify in vivo the correlation between the Shh and the BBS pathways, we performed
immunohistochemical analysis on a set of 84 human SCLC samples with Shh and GRPR
specific antibodies. Representative stainings are shown in figure 1C, and the dataset is
reported in figure 1D. Interestingly, the majority of the SCLC samples examined were
positive for Shh (77.4%) and GRPR (66.7%). Overall, 56% of the cases showed coexpression of Shh and GRPR (p=0.04).

Silencing of Shh in SCLC cells abolishes proliferation, invasion and colony formation in
response to BBS
To investigate whether the Shh pathway participates in the effects of BBS on SCLC cells,
we stably silenced Shh in H209 cells by using three shRNA targeting plasmids and
generating different mass culture populations (sh Shh MP1, MP2, MP3). Figure 1E shows
the level of Shh protein knock-down, using tubulin as loading control. When testing the
proliferative rate of these newly generated cells, we observed that Shh knock-down cells
grew more slowly than H209 cells stably transfected with scrambled shRNA; moreover they
did not respond to BBS stimulation (Fig. 1F). Nonetheless, treatment with Shh ligand was

able to rescue the knock-down effect and to increase number of cells (Fig. 1F). To evaluate
the effect of Shh silencing on other biological properties of H209 cells, we tested the ability
of Shh knockdown cells to perform invasive growth in Matrigel and to form colonies in soft
agar. As shown in figure 1G, when embedded in 3D Matrigel the shRNA scrambled cells
were able to proliferate and generate large colonies in response to BBS and, to a lesser
extent, in response to Shh ligand. On the contrary, Shh silenced cells did not proliferate.
Once again, stimulation with Shh ligand reverted the effect of silenced Shh (Fig. 1G).
Similarly, when testing the ability of the cells to form colonies in soft agar, we observed that
Shh knock-down cells generated only few small colonies; on the contrary, cells stably
transfected with scrambled shRNA generated large colonies whose number and size was
further increased in response to BBS (p<0.01)(Fig 1H, I).
BBS stimulation activates the Shh-Gli1 pathway

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The transcriptional output of the Shh signaling is mediated by the Gli transcription factors.
To investigate the possibility of a direct interaction between the Shh and the BBS pathways,
we engineered a reporter plasmid (Gli-Luc), where the luciferase gene was under the control
of 8 Gli1-responsive elements (Supplementary Informations, Fig. S1A) and produced
mutant (Ptch insensitive) Smo (SmoA1) and soluble N-Shh (Supplementary Information,
Fig. S1A, B). We stably transfected GRPR in NIH3T3 cells and used for further experiments
these NIH-GRPR expressing cells together with H209, H378, and H510A SCLC cells that
express BBS and GRPR endogenously.18 In NIH3T3-GRPR, H209, H378, and H510A cells,
but not in H82 and H1339, BBS stimulation significantly increased Gli-luciferase activity
(Fig. 2A). This activation was abolished when Shh was silenced in H209 cells,
demonstrating once again that Shh mediates the effect of BBS in SCLC cells (Fig. 2B).
Moreover, Gli-Luc activation was paralleled by accumulation of Gli1 protein into the
nucleus, as tested by immunofluorescence in both, NIH-GRPR and H378 SCLC cells (Fig.
2C); in basal conditions, upon serum deprivation, Gli1 was mainly located into the cytosol,
while it redistributed to the nucleus upon stimulation with 100 nM of BBS (Fig. 2C). Same
results were also obtained by Western blotting of sub-cellular nuclear fractions where SP1
was used as a loading control (Fig. 2D).
G protein αq and α13 promote activation of the Shh-Gli1 pathway

Author Manuscript

GRPR signals through heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein Gαq and Gα12/13.
Evidence that BBS activated the Gli-mediated transcription, prompted us to investigate
whether this activation was mediated by Gαq and Gα12/13. We first checked if other GPCR
coupled to Gαq or Gα12/13 activated Gli-Luc. We used parental NIH3T3 cells endogenously
expressing thrombin (Thr) receptor PAR-1, coupled to Gα12/13, and transfected NIH3T3
cells exogenously expressing muscarinic receptor (m1), coupled to Gαq. Stimulation with
both Thr (ligand for PAR-1) or carbachol, Cch, (a cholinergic agonist ligand for m1)
activated Gli-Luc (Fig. 3A); SmoA1 was used as positive control (Fig. 3A).
To check if Gαq and Gα13 were able to directly activate Gli, we transiently transfected
NIH3T3 cells with wild type (WT) or activated (QL) GTPase-deficient forms of Gα13, Gαq,
Gαs, or Gαi. Constitutively active Gα13 and Gαq induced Gli-Luc response, to a similar

extent as GαiQL, a known mediator of the signaling downstream of Smo receptor21 (Fig.
3B). Differently, GαsQL was unable to activate Gli (Fig. 3B).

Author Manuscript

To clarify the role of Gαq, and Gα13 in mediating BBS-dependent Gli1 response, we used
mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) knock-out for Gαq/11 or Gα12/1322Supplementary
Informations, Fig. S2). In these MEFs, we evaluated the activation of Gli-Luc upon transient
transfection with empty vector, m1 or GRPR receptors followed by stimulation with Thr,
Cch and BBS, respectively. As shown in figure 3C, Thr was ableto induce a Gli-Luc
response in wild type (+/+) MEFs while the effect was lost in Gα12/13 knockout (-/-)
fibroblasts and was reduced in Gαq/11 -/-MEFs, suggesting that Thr can signal to Gli mainly
through Gα12/13. On the other hand, Cch was not able to elicit a Gli-Luc response in
Gαq/11-/- cells and its function was reduced in Gα12/13 -/- MEFs (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, the
effect of BBS on Gli-luciferase activation was lost in both knockout MEFs, indicating that,
although Gαq/11 or Gα12/13 subunits can signal to the nucleus independently, they may be
both required for the full stimulation of Gli by BBS (Fig. 3C).
BBS mediated Gli activation is dependent on Rho and is sensitive to C3 toxin

Author Manuscript

Monomeric Rho GTPase is the main effector of Gαq and Gα13 proteins and BBS leads to
rapid Rho activation.23, 24 Moreover, Rho has been involved in Hh signaling.4, 5 To address
the possibility that Rho could mediate the BBS activation of Gli,we transfected a
constitutively active form of Rho (Rho QL) in NIH3T3-GRPR cells. Rho QL resulted in the
stimulation of the Gli-Luc reporter, when compared to the SRF-Luc reporter, a bona fide
Rho target (Fig. 3D). Moreover the Clostridium botulinum C3 toxin, which specifically
ADP-ribosylates at residue 41 and inhibits Rho25, blocked Gli activation in response to
BBS, Thr or Cch and in response to Rho QL in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 3D, E), as well as in
response to BBS in H378 and H209 cells (Fig. 3F). All together our results support that the
small GTPase Rho plays an important role in regulating signaling to Gli in response to BBS.
Activation of a Shh autocrine loop in cells stimulated with BBS

Author Manuscript

Previous studies have shown that several GPCRs (including GRPR) activate Nuclear Factor
κB (NFκB) through different mechanism, initiated by heterotrimeric G- proteins and
converging on IκB phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NFκB (reviewed in26).
Moreover, Rho is able to activate NFκB.27 Thus, we tested whether in SCLC cells BBS
signals to NFκB through Rho. Figure 4A shows that in NIH-GRPR cells BBS potently
activated NFκB Luc, and that a specific inhibitor of NFκB (IκBαM) completely abolished
this activation. Interestingly, C3 toxin also impaired BBS-mediated NFκB activation (Fig.
4A). To study the role of NFκB in regulating the BBS mediated signal to Gli, we transiently
transfected IκBαM in NIH-GRPR cells and observed a reduced activation of Gli Luc upon
BBS treatment (Fig. 4B). IκBαM did not affect the activation of Gli Luc mediated by active
Smo receptor (Smo A1), hence serving as a specificity control (Fig 4B). A recent study has
characterized Shh as a direct target of NFκB; NFκB binds to the Shh promoter and triggers
its transcription.28 We therefore tested whether BBS would directly stimulate Shh
transcription through NFκB activation. BBS stimulation significantly increased the mRNA
levels of Shh in NIH-GRPR and H378 SCLC cells, and this effect was lost in the presence
of IkBαM (Fig 4C). A similar result was observed by Shh Western blot in NIH-GRPR cells

transfected with IkBαM or Rho inhibitor C3 (Fig. 4D). Of direct relevance to SCLC
biology, H378 and H209 SCLC cells stimulated with BBS showed a remarkable increase in
Shh protein levels aligned with its impact in Shh gene expression (Supplementary
Informations, Fig. S3). All together, these results suggest that BBS activates Shh production
through a Gαq/Gα12/13-Rho-NFκB mediated pathway, and that in turn this likely causes Gli
activation.
The Smo antagonist cyclopamine synergizes with Bortezomib and Cisplatin in SCLC cells

Author Manuscript

To test the dependency of the BBS effect on the Smo receptor, we performed Gli-Luc assay
in the presence of cyclopamine (Cyc), an inhibitor of Smo.6 Our results indicate that Smo
block resulted in substantial inhibition of BBS dependent Gli-Luc activation in NIH-GRPR
cells as well as in H378 SCLC cells (Fig. 5A). Moreover, parallel pharmacological
inhibition of Smo (with cyclopamine) and use of Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor able to
block NfkB,29 abolished BBS-mediated proliferative effect in H209 cells, suggesting that
Shh and NFκB pathways are both involved in the response of SCLC cells to BBS (Fig. 5B).
On the contrary, NFκB Luc activation by BBS was not affected by cyclopamine
(Supplementary Informations, Fig. S4), thus indicating that the activation of NFκB is
independent on Smo. As a control, IkBαM reduced cell proliferation in response to BBS in
H209 without affecting their survival, albeit C3 toxin abolished the BBS effect on cell
proliferation and also limited their survival under the same experimental conditions
(Supplementary Informations, Fig S5).

Author Manuscript

SCLCs are poorly responsive to conventional therapies, and they quite often develop
resistance to routinely used chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin.30 We treated H378
cells with cisplatin in the presence or absence of cyclopamine. Figure 5C shows that, while
as expected cisplatin treatment had only modest effect in reducing cell viability,30
cyclopamine instead induced a significant reduction of living cells. More interestingly, the
combination of cisplatin with cyclopamine resulted in a dramatic decrease of cell viability
(Fig. 5C).

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

Signaling pathways that play a crucial role during development may also be implicated in
tumorigenesis.31 The Hedgehog pathway represents one important example of this concept.
Loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the inhibitory receptor of the pathway,
Patched (Ptch), are responsible for an inherited cancer predisposition syndrome known as
Gorlin or naevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS).11 Mammalian sonic hedgehog,
Shh, a secreted ligand, mediates epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during lung
development by regulating signals involved in branching morphogenesis12 and the loss of
Shh results in severe lung defects in mice.32
Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a very aggressive tumour with neuroendocrine features.2
Autocrine growth factors secreted from SCLC cells belonging to the bombesin (BBS) like
peptide (BLP) family, mainly gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and its cognate receptor
(GRPR), promote growth and invasion.33 Significant SCLC growth inhibition in vitro as
well as in vivo has been achieved by different strategies blocking either BBS or GRPR.34

Shh signalling is activated in SCLCs, where it promotes both tumour development and
maintenance.13 However, no mutations in Shh pathway components have been found in
SCLCs13 and therefore the mechanisms of Shh activation in SCLC remain unclear.14
Our data show that BBS induces proliferation of SCLC cells and this effect is blocked by
cyclopamine, an inhibitor of Smo. Moreover, we demonstrate that BBS activates the GliLucreporter through G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) mediated activation of Gαq and
Gα12/13 proteins and through downstream activation of Rho. BBS mediates also NFkB
activation through the same G proteins, and our results are aligned with the proposed model
that NFkB may in turn bind to the Shh promoter directly and stimulate Shh transcription,
thus generating an autocrine signaling loop initiated by BBS that results in Shh ligand
production (Fig. 6).

Author Manuscript

Our findings shed light on the mechanism underlying Shh pathway activation in SCLC. The
expression of BBS/GRPR-Shh pairs in many other cancer types, such as glioblastoma,35
gastrointestinal tract tumors,36 pancreatic cancers,37 head and neck squamous
cellcarcinomas38 and neuroblastomas39 and the observation that the Shh pathway is
increased in these malignancies opens the possibility that the mechanism described here can
be more general, and maybe operational also in other cancer types. Furthermore, the
existence of an autocrine loop starting from BBS and leading to Shh production can also be
important in initiating paracrine signaling between cancer and stroma cells; accordingly,
several reports suggest that the paracrine Shh production by tumor cells is able to activate
Gli signaling in stromal cells and viceversa.40, 41

Author Manuscript

More than 50 compounds have been isolated thus far that act as inhibitors of the Hh
pathway; at least five of them are in clinical trials (Cur-61414, IPI-926, GDC-0449, XL139,
LDE-225).42 A recent study suggested that inhibition of the Shh pathway in mouse models
cooperates with chemotherapy to delay SCLC recurrence.14 In this framework, our data may
open new therapeutic approaches for this aggressive disease, as it may be possible to target
the autocrine activation of GRPR, and/or disrupt their downstream pathways resulting in the
local Shh secretion, as part of future combined anti-cancer therapies for SCLC.

(forward) and 5'-GGAGCGGTTAGGGCTACTCT-3' (reverse); GAPDH: 5'ACAGTCAGCCGCATCTTCTT-3' (forward) and 5'-ACGACCAAATCCGTTGACTC-3'
(reverse). Fluorescent threshold values were measured in triplicate, and fold changes were
calculated by the formula 2-(sample 1 ΔCt - sample 2 ΔCt), where ΔCt is the difference
between the amplification fluorescence thresholds of the mRNA of interest and the GAPDH
mRNA.
Proliferation assays

Thymidine incorporation: Proliferation of H378 cells was measured as amount of DNA
synthesis. Cells were pretreated with cyclopamine for 48 hours and grown over night in low
(2.5%) serum medium +/- BBS stimulation. [H3]-thymidine was added to a final
concentration of 1μCi/ml and cells were incubated for 6 hours at 37°. Cells were then
washed twice in cold PBS, incubated 10 minutes at 4° with 6% trichloroacetic acid
(TCA),washed twice in water and lysed is 0.5 N NaOH for 1 hour at 37°. Thymidine
incorporation was measured with a scintillation counter, and values were reported as DPM
(disintegrations per minute). Cell count: The cell count was performed using a TC10
Automated Cell Counter (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Cell Titre Blue assay: Cells were plated at 1,000 cells/well in a volume of 35 μl
of DMEM supplemented with 2.5% FBS. CellTiter-Blue reagent (Promega, Madison, WI,
USA) (10 μl) diluted (1:1) in culture medium was added to each well. Plates were incubated
at 37 °C, in 5% CO2 for 6 hours and then transferred to room temperature for overnight

incubation, at dark. Cell viability was measured by dye reduction with an EnVision
Multilabel plate reader at an excitation wavelength of 530 nm and emission wavelength of
590 nm (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The raw data were smoothed using loesscorrection and subsequently normalized to the median of the negative controls and log2transformed (loess-log normalization).
Soft agar colony formation assay and growth in 3D matrigel
Cells (20.000) were plated in 60mm dishes and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for colony
formation. After 15 days, colonies were fixed with 10% (v/v) methanol for 15 min and
stained with crystal violet for 30 min for colony visualisation. Each count was performed in
triplicate.

For outgrowth in Matrigel, 10.000 cells were mixed with 160 μl of Matrigel (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and plated in 35 mm dishes containing a glass coverslip.
After hardening, cells were overlaid with 2 mL growth medium and incubated at 37 degrees
for up to 8 days.
Immunohistochemistry

Author Manuscript

Archival frozen lung tissue samples from 84 patients affected by SCLCs were retrieved from
the files of the Pathological Anatomy, Department of Surgery of the University of Pisa
uponinformed consent. All tumor samples were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded for
microscopic examination. The most representative paraffin block of each tumor was selected
for analysis. Histologic diagnosis and pathologic features were obtained by 2 pathologists
(G. Alì and G. Fontanini) according to the World Health Organization (WHO) 2004
histologic criteria.46 Immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) was performed on 3-μm tissue
sections. After deparaffinization through serial xylene baths, sections were rehydrated
through a graded series of ethanol and water baths (5 minutes each). After a deionized water
wash (3 minutes), the sections were heated to 98°C for 40 minutes to unmask target
antigens, then cooled at room temperature and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
for 3 minutes. After treatment with peroxide block, sections were washed again in PBS and
incubated with power block reagent (Biogenex Laboratories, San Ramon, CA, USA) for 30
minutes. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Gli, rabbit polyclonal anti-GRPR and rabbit polyclonal antiShh were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and were used overnight
at 4°C at 1:50, 1:20 and 1:30 dilution respectively. After washing with PBS,
immunoreactivity was obtained by using the Super Sensitive Polymer-HRP Detection
System (Biogenex, Fremont, CA, USA), following manufacturer's instructions. After rinsing
with PBS for 3 minutes, sections were incubated 20 minutes at room temperature with Super
Enhancer Reagent, followed by incubation with Poly-HRP reagent. The reaction was
developed using 0.05% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride until adequate color
development was seen. A negative control was obtained by omitting primaryantibody. Two
pathologists (G. Alì and G. Fontanini) evaluated and graded immunohistochemical staining
by scoring separately the percentage of positive tumor cells (< 10%; ≥ 10%) and their
staining intensity (0/1+: 2+; 3+). The pathologists were blinded to clinico-pathologic
characteristics of the patients. All experiments were approved by the “Comitato etico per la

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using a paired, two-tailed Student's t test or Mann
Whithney test (IHC) (GraphPad Prism 3.0, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA), and
differences were considered to be statistically significant at a value of p <0.05. Data analysis
was performed using GraphPad Prism 5.03 (GraphPad Software). All values were expressed
as the means ± standard error (SE) or standard deviation (SD). Differences were considered
significant at p value <0.05. Student's t-test was used to analyze the differences between
control and treatment groups.

Figure 6. Schematic representation of the mechanism of action of bombesin on the Shh pathway
in SCLC cells

Bombesin activates GRPR receptor that is linked to Gαq and Gα12/13 proteins. Gαq and
Gα12/13 signaling involves Rho, that stimulates a variety of transcription factors, such as
NFkB. Activation of NFkB increases production of Shh, which in turn activates Gli through
Ptch and Smo membrane receptors on the same cell (autocrine signaling) or neighbouring
cells (paracrine signaling).
