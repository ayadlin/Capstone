BACKGROUND: This study aimed to apply the International mRCC Database Consortium (IMDC) prognostic model in metastatic non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma (nccRCC). In addition, the survival outcome of metastatic nccRCC patients was characterized. METHODS: Data on 2215 patients (1963 with clear-cell RCC [ccRCC] and 252 with nccRCC) treated with first-line VEGFand mTOR-targeted therapies were collected from the IMDC. Time to treatment failure (TTF) and overall survival (OS) were compared
in groups with favorable, intermediate, and poor prognoses according to IMDC prognostic criteria RESULTS: The median OS of the
entire cohort was 20.9 months. nccRCC patients were younger (P <.0001) and more often presented with low hemoglobin (P 5.014)
and elevated neutrophils (P 5.0001), but otherwise had clinicopathological features similar to those of ccRCC patients. OS (12.8 vs
22.3 months; P <.0001) and TTF (4.2 vs 7.8 months; P <.0001) were worse in nccRCC patients compared with ccRCC patients. The
hazard ratio for death and TTF when adjusted for the prognostic factors was 1.41 (95% CI, 1.19-1.67; P <.0001) and 1.54 (95% CI, 1.331.79; P <.0001), respectively. The IMDC prognostic model reliably discriminated 3 risk groups to predict OS and TTF in nccRCC; the
median OS of the favorable, intermediate, and poor prognosis groups was 31.4, 16.1, and 5.1 months, respectively (P <.0001), and the
median TTF was 9.6, 4.9, and 2.1 months, respectively (P <.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Although targeted agents have significantly
improved the outcome of patients with nccRCC, for the majority survival is still inferior compared with patients with ccRCC. The

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) arises from the kidney parenchyma and is a complex aggregate of several malignant subtypes.1
According to the World Health Organization classification system, the major subtypes are clear-cell RCC (ccRCC), papillary RCC (pRCC), chromophobe RCC (chRCC), unclassified RCC (unRCC), and RCC of the collecting duct.2
In ccRCC, the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) gene is inactivated in 80% to 90%, and as a consequence, the vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways are deregulated.1,3 Agents that
target members of these pathways have supplanted immunotherapies and have been internationally recognized as the

standard-of-care therapy in metastatic RCC (mRCC).4
Because the VEGF and mTOR pathways are particularly
important for the biology of ccRCC, randomized phase 3
clinical trials were performed in patient cohorts that were
exclusively or predominately composed of ccRCC
patients.5-9 To date, the 20% of patients with non-clear
cell renal cell carcinoma (nccRCC) included in the temsirolimus phase 3 study are the largest cohort that has been
investigated in a randomized phase 3 trial of targeted
agents.7 Therefore, the clinical outcomes of patients who
have nccRCC and were treated with VEGF- and mTORtargeted agents remain undefined.
The International mRCC Database Consortium
(IMDC), or Heng model, has proven to be a useful prognostic tool in major clinical trials of novel targeted therapies.10 This model has 6 independent predictors of poor
survival: Karnofsky performance status (KPS) <80%,
time from diagnosis to treatment interval <1 year, anemia, hypercalcemia, neutrophilia, and thrombocytosis.
According to the number of poor prognostic factors,
patients were segregated into favorable-, intermediate-,
and poor- risk groups, with 0, 1-2, and 3 factors, respectively. The model was developed and externally validated
without consideration of the histological RCC subtypes.11,12 It was assumed that the results were largely
affected by the ccRCC subtype because it was the predominant histological subtype in the development and validation cohort.11,12 Therefore, it is unclear whether the
IMDC prognostic model can be applied in nccRCC.
This study aimed to characterize the applicability of
the IMDC prognostic model and the survival outcome of
patients with nccRCC who were treated with first-line
VEGF and mTOR inhibitors. For this purpose, we
assessed the time to treatment failure (TTF) and overall
survival (OS) in ccRCC and nccRCC patients. We
applied the IMDC prognostic model to the nccRCC
patients and evaluated its discriminatory ability. This
study was performed as a large retrospective analysis by
the IMDC, a worldwide collaboration of academic
centers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Populations

The International mRCC Database Consortiums includes
20 academic centers from Canada, the United States,
Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Denmark. Data were
collected from August 15, 2008, until October, 10, 2012.
At the time of analysis, the database covered data of 2370
patients who had received first-line targeted therapy
3000

between 2003 and 2012. Patients were excluded from
analysis because of unknown histological subtypes
(n 5 153) and unknown treatment initiation date
(n 5 2).
All centers obtained local institutional review
board approval before including data in this large
retrospective study. Baseline patient characteristics
included demographic, clinicopathological, and laboratory data as described in the development study of
the IMDC risk model.11 Survival data were retrospectively collected from medical chart reviews and
publically available records. Uniform data templates
were used to ensure consistent data collection at each
institution. Patients may have been treated in part in
clinical trials or with the standard of care according
to national cancer guidelines.
Statistical Analyses

The primary objective of this study was to prove the
applicability of the IMDC prognostic model separately in
nccRCC. The secondary objective was to characterize
clinical outcomes in terms of TTF and OS of nccRCC
compared with ccRCC in patients treated with targeted
therapies. OS was defined as the period between targeted
therapy initiation and date of death, or it was censored on
the day of the last follow-up visit. TTF was defined as the
period between treatment initiation and progression, drug
cessation, or death, or it was censored at the last follow-up
visit. Progression was determined according to clinical criteria that made continuation of treatment impossible or
radiographic criteria using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors.
Patient and tumor characteristics of ccRCC and
nccRCC patients were compared using the chi-square
test. OS and TTF were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier
method, and differences between histological groups were
examined with the log-rank test or the Wald chi-square
test from the Cox regression adjusted for the IMDC risk
factors.
We applied the IMDC model (presence/absence of
the 6 predetermined prognostic factors to determine the
favorable-, intermediate-, and poor-risk groups)11,12 to
nccRCC patients using Cox regression. Concordance
indices (c-index) were computed to test the predictive accuracy of the IMDC prognostic model; a c-index of 0.5
indicates no predictive accuracy, and an index of 1 shows
perfect predictive accuracy.13
The statistical analyses were performed using SAS
version 9 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), and P < .05 (2 sided)
was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
Characterization of the Clinical Outcome

Comparing nccRCC with ccRCC in Treatment
Outcomes

The study cohort was composed of 2215 patients. Overall, 1963 patients (88.6%) had ccRCC, and 252 (11.4%)
had nccRCC. Tumors with a clear-cell component/mixed
ccRCC and nccRCCs (n 5 21) were considered ccRCC
based on the study design of previously reported phase 3
randomized clinical trials in mRCC.10,14 Tumors with
nccRCC histology included papillary RCC (n 5 151,
59.9%), chromophobe RCC (n 5 37, 14.7%), collecting
duct RCC (n 5 7, 2.8%), unclassified RCC (n 5 34,
13.5%), and RCC with Xp11 translocation (n 5 4,
1.6%). Nineteen patients were coded as nccRCC by the
study center without further information on the exact
nccRCC subtype. We did not analyze pRCC separately in
groups of type I and type II because our database does not
contain this information. The comparison of patient characteristics revealed that nccRCC patients were younger
(P < .0001) and had more baseline anemia (P 5 .014)
and neutrophilia (P 5 .0001). Otherwise, ccRCC and
nccRCC patients had similar clinicopathological characteristics (Table 1).
In the whole cohort, the median overall survival
time after targeted therapy initiation was 20.9
months (95% CI, 19.7-22.6 months), with 798
patients (36%) remaining alive at the time of analysis. The median follow-up in living patients was 22.3
months (IQR, 10.8-38.4 months). The first-line targeted therapies had been stopped in 1898 of 2215
patients (86%) at the time of analysis. The median
time on the first-line targeted therapies was 7.2
months (range, 01-911 months).

Patients with nccRCC were significantly more often
treated with mTOR therapies in first- (6.8% vs 1.5%,
P < .0001) and second-line (44.7% vs 30.9%,
P 5 .011) therapy. Treatment response data to firstline therapy were available for 1801 of 2215 patients
(81%). In ccRCC patients, the best response rates to
first-line therapies were 1.1% complete response (CR),
26.8% partial response (PR), 50.2% stable disease
(SD), and 21.9% progressive disease (PD), whereas it
was 1.0% CR, 14.9% PR, 50.0% SD, and 34.1%
PD in nccRCC patients (P < .0001). For first-line
therapy, the median TTF was 7.8 months (95% CI,
7.2-8.1 months) and 4.2 months (95% CI, 3.7-5.2
months) in ccRCC and nccRCC, respectively (HR,
1.57; 95% CI, 1.37-1.80; P < .0001; Table 2, Fig.
1A). Second-line therapy achieved best response rates
of 0.4% CR, 11.3% PR, 49.6% SD, and 38.7% PD
in ccRCC patients and 8.5% PR, 45.1% SD, and
46.3% PD in nccRCC patients (P 5 .526). The
detailed best response rates of each subtype are shown
in Table 3. The median TTF on the second-line therapy for ccRCC and nccRCC was 3.9 months (95%
CI, 3.4-4.4 months) and 2.8 months (95% CI, 2.33.7 months), respectively (P 5 .142; Table 2, Fig.
1B). Both groups had a similar median TTF for the
third-line therapy: 4.0 months (95% CI, 3.3-4.6
months) in ccRCC and 3.4 months (95% CI, 2.4-7.1
months) in nccRCC (P 5 .544; Table 2). All treatment sequences are displayed in detail in Table 2.

Overall Survival Outcomes

The entire nccRCC cohort had a significantly shorter OS
than the ccRCC cohort; median OS was 22.3 months
(95% CI, 20.7-23.5 months) and 12.8 months (95% CI,
11.0-16.1 months) in ccRCC and nccRCC, respectively
(P < .0001; Fig. 1C). After adjustment for the IMDC risk
group criteria, patients with nccRCC tumors had a HR for
death of 1.41 (95% CI, 1.19-1.67; P < .0001; Table 3). In
subgroup analyses, median OS was 27.1 months (95% CI,
12.6-75.3 months), 14.0 months (95% CI, 10.9-17.1
months), and 10.1 months (95% CI, 5.1-13.2 months) in
chRCC, pRCC, and unRCC, respectively (Table 3, Fig.
1D). When pRCC was compared with ccRCC, the
adjusted HR for death was 1.57 (95% CI, 1.27-1.94;
P < .0001). Likewise, unRCC subtype had a higher risk for
death (HR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.14-2.56; adjusted HR, 1.51;
95% CI, 0.98-2.31). By contrast, the chRCC subtype had
comparable survival outcome with ccRCC in both univariate and multivariable analysis (adjusted HR, 0.89; 95% CI,
0.55-1.45; P 5 .646; Table 3).
IMDC Risk Model for nccRCC

We next investigated the applicability of the IMDC risk
model as a prognostic tool for TTF and OS in nccRCC.
According to the 6 predefined IMDC risk criteria, 29
(13%), 127 (57%), and 66 (30%) nccRCC patients and
3002

337 (19%), 972 (55%), and 463 (26%) ccRCC patients
were assigned to favorable, intermediate, and poor prognosis groups (P 5 .08). Among the nccRCC patients, the
median TTF of the first-line treatment in the 3 risk groups
was 9.6 months (95% CI, 3.9-16.2 months), 4.9 months
(95% CI, 3.9-5.7 months), and 2.1 months (95% CI, 1.32.9 months), see Figure 2A. The HRs were 1.57 (95% CI,
1.02-2.42) and 3.10 (95% CI, 1.94-4.95) in the intermediate and poor prognosis groups, respectively, compared with
favorable-risk patients (P < .0001). The estimated median
OS of the 3 IMDC risk groups was 31.4 months (95% CI,
14.2-78.3 months), 16.1 months (95% CI, 12.5-18.7
months), and 5.1 months (95% CI, 2.7-7.1 months); see
Figure 2B. The intermediate-risk group had an increased
HR for death of 1.97 (95% CI, 1.13-3.42), and those with
a poor prognosis had an HR of 5.69 (95% CI, 3.20-10.1;
P < .0001). The c-indices for OS with the 3 groups were
0.66 (95% CI, 0.63-0.70) for the IMDC model and 0.64
(95% CI, 0.60-0.68) for the Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center (MSKCC) risk criteria.
We then correlated each of the individual 6 IMDC
risk criteria with OS outcome in nccRCC. There was a
significant association of all prognostic factors with OS
in univariable analyses (HR range, 1.5-3.2; P < .01;
Table 4B). Given the limited numbers of patients and low
prevalence of some laboratory risk factors, we did not

have sufficient power to test all 6 risk factors in the multivariable model. However, the model yielded a c-index of
0.70 (95% CI, 0.66-0.74) when using the 6 risk factors
individually instead of collapsing them into 3 risk groups,
suggesting good discriminatory ability.
DISCUSSION
In the current study, we report 2 findings: 1) the IMDC
risk model reliably prognosticates clinical outcome in
nccRCC, and 2) in the targeted-therapy era, the majority
of nccRCC patients still have inferior clinical outcomes
compared with patients with ccRCC.
The introduction of agents targeting the VEGF and
mTOR pathways in clinical practice has revolutionized
the treatment of mRCC. Median overall survival time has
doubled when compared with historical control treatment
with immunotherapy.12 The improvement of the survival
rates is particularly true for ccRCC, which represents the
majority of mRCC. Less is known about the survival outcomes of nccRCC, which accounts for only 10%-15% of
RCC.1,2 Patients with metastatic nccRCC have a worse
3004

response to immunotherapies than do those with
ccRCC.15 Motzer et al described a median OS of 9.4
months in a cohort treated with several kinds of
cytokines.16 An early retrospective study of the targetedtherapy era described a median OS of 19.4 months in a
cohort of pRCC and chRCC patients, and this was significantly longer than the OS outcome of 13.4 months in the
sunitinib expanded-access program.17,18 The OS was very
heterogeneous, with 25.6 and 16.8 months in 2 recent
sunitinib phase 2 trials and 14.0 months in a phase 2 everolimus study.19-21 In the 2 studies demonstrating the longest OS (19.4 and 25.6 months), the rate of death events
(40%) was very low, and thus both studies may have
overestimated the median OS.17,19 In our study, 70% of
nccRCC patients had died at the time of analysis, and the
majority of nccRCC patients (93.2%) were treated with
an anti-VEGF therapy, with sunitinib the drug used most
often. This may explain the shorter median OS compared
with the smaller studies and the high concordance with
the sunitinib open-access trial.18 Moreover, the sunitinib
open-access program and the current study are the largest

cohorts to investigate survival outcomes in nccRCC.
Other studies that revealed better survival outcomes of
nccRCC may have been biased by their small sample sizes.
In our study, nccRCC patients were more often
treated with mTOR-targeted therapies than were ccRCC
patients. Dutcher et al showed that nccRCC and ccRCC
patients who were treated with temsirolimus had comparable OS and progression-free survival.22 Our study found
that nccRCC patients had a significantly inferior survival
outcome compared with ccRCC patients. Some studies restricted the nccRCC population to certain subtypes,17,19
whereas others included a wider range of nccRCC subtypes.20,21 Similar to the sunitinib open-access trial, our
study cohort included patients without restriction by
nccRCC subtype.18 However, the sunitinib open-access
program described survival outcome not separately by
nccRCC subtype.18 We found that patients with chRCC
had the best OS and those with pRCC and unRCC the
worst OS. These findings confirm the results of smaller
studies.11,23-25 In chRCC, preclinical studies have demonstrated that mTOR is activated by inactivation of its negative regulatory protein folliculin.26 Higher mTOR activity
is related to higher hypoxia-inducible factor-a production.27 Both pathways are major targets of the drugs used
in our patients. Recently, a phase 2 trial with foretinib, a
dual inhibitor of VEGFR2 and MET, demonstrated an
overall response rate of 13.5% (all PR) and a PFS of 9.3
months, with an intriguing 50% response in pRCC
patients with a germ-line MET mutation.28 In the future,
MET inhibitors may improve the survival outcome of
pRCCs patients, possibly in a selected population. However, new drugs that better consider the unique biological
properties of each nccRCC subtype are needed.
To the best of our knowledge, there is actually no
other modern prognostic model that has been assessed
exclusively in advanced nccRCC. Here, we have demonstrated that the IMDC risk criteria reliably segregated
nccRCC into 3 risk groups similar to our previous studies.11,12 Moreover, the accuracy in prognosticating the
OS was slightly higher than with the MSKCC risk model,
which was one of the most often used prognostic models
in the past.29
The current study has several limitations that merit
discussion. First, the evaluation of TTF and OS was done
at each center without an independent radiological assessment. Our results are based on a retrospective investigation of a highly heterogeneous study population. We had
to exclude 7% of the patients because of an unknown histology. There was no central pathology review, and therefore, some tumors may have been misclassified, but this

may better reflect daily clinical practice, in which dedicated kidney cancer pathologists may not be available, and
therefore results may be more generalizable.
Conclusions

The IMDC risk model is a reliable prognostication tool
that can be employed to prognosticate OS in nccRCC for
patient counseling and clinical trials design. The survival
outcome for the majority of nccRCC patients remains
lower than their clear-cell counterparts. However, chRCC
patients have a survival outcome that is comparable to
ccRCC patients.
