Abstract
The chicken anemia virus–derived protein apoptin induces apoptosis in a variety of human malignant and
transformed cells but not in normal cells. However, the mechanisms through which apoptin achieves its selective killing effects are not well understood. We developed a lentiviral vector encoding a green fluorescent
protein–apoptin fusion gene (LV-GFP-AP) that can efficiently deliver apoptin into hematopoietic cells. Apoptin selectively killed the human multiple myeloma cell lines MM1.R and MM1.S, and the leukemia cell lines
K562, HL60, U937, KG1, and NB4. In contrast, normal CD34+ cells were not killed and maintained their differentiation potential in multilineage colony formation assays. In addition, dexamethasone-resistant MM1.R cells
were found to be more susceptible to apoptin-induced cell death than the parental matched MM1.S cells. Death
susceptibility correlated with increased phosphorylation and activation of the apoptin protein in MM1.R cells.
Expression array profiling identified differential kinase profiles between MM1.R and MM1.S cells. Among these
kinases, protein kinase Cβ (PKCβ) was found by immunoprecipitation and in vitro kinase studies to be a candidate kinase responsible for apoptin phosphorylation. Indeed, shRNA knockdown or drug-mediated inhibition
of PKCβ significantly reduced apoptin phosphorylation. Furthermore, apoptin-mediated cell death proceeded
through the upregulation of PKCβ, activation of caspase-9/3, cleavage of the PKCδ catalytic domain, and downregulation of the MERTK and AKT kinases. Collectively, these results elucidate a novel pathway for apoptin activation involving PKCβ and PKCδ. Further, they highlight the potential of apoptin and its cellular regulators to purge
bone marrow used in autologous transplantation for multiple myeloma. Cancer Res; 70(18); 7242–52. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Stem cell rescue following high-dose cytotoxic chemotherapy is considered curative and has gained extensive application
worldwide as a therapeutic modality in several hematologic
malignancies (1–4). Allogeneic bone marrow transplant is the
preferred choice for most types of leukemias, but due to the
rarity of HLA-compatible donors, autologous bone marrow
transplantation is still an alternative therapeutic option. However, disease relapse remains a primary cause of death, partially
due to inefficient elimination of contaminated clonogenic
tumor cells from the autografts. Multiple pharmacologic and
immunologic approaches aiming at the elimination of

leukemic cells have been developed; however, to date, these
purging methods have shown only limited efficacy, restricting
their clinical applications (5, 6). In addition, several gene
therapy–based trials have been conducted for the selective removal of contaminating epithelial cancer cells from autografts.
However, these strategies have been shown to be inefficient
for purging of leukemia cells mainly due to the lack of efficient
gene delivery into hematologic malignant cells (7, 8).
Apoptin, a chicken anemia virus–derived protein, has been
shown to possess tumor-specific cytotoxicity (9, 10). Its expression induces apoptosis in human tumor and transformed
cells, but there is little or no cytotoxic effect in many normal
human cell lines derived from different tissues, including peripheral blood mononuclear cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial
cells (11–13). Several studies have shown that the tumorspecific killing of apoptin correlates with its phosphorylation
and its subcellular localization (14, 15). In cancer cells,
apoptin is localized in the nucleus and is phosphorylated
on Thr-108 by an as yet unknown kinase (16, 17), whereas
in normal cells apoptin is detected in the cytoplasm and is
essentially unphosphorylated. Recent studies have reported
that apoptin interacts with the p85 Src homology 3 (SH3)
domain of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K) and protein
kinase B (AKT) in MCF7 breast and PC3 prostate cancer
cell lines. The activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway by apoptin
results in the induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK2,
in turn leading to the phosphorylation of apoptin (18, 19).

PKC Regulates Apoptin Tumor-Specific Killing

In contrast, we have found no correlation between AKT
activity in human cancer cell lines and their sensitivities to
apoptin killing.3
In this study, we used a matched pair of multiple myeloma
cell lines (MM1.R and MM1.S) that show resistance (R) or
sensitivity (S) to dexamethasone, with MM1.R being derived
from MM1.S through continuous growth in dexamethasone.
These cell lines showed a marked difference in sensitivity to
apoptin-induced killing, with MM1.R being clearly more sensitive than MM1.S. Microarray expression profiling of these
cell lines showed that several kinases, including members of
the protein kinase C (PKC) family, are overexpressed in the
apoptin-sensitive cell line MM1.R compared with MM1.S cells
(see Supplementary Table S1).
PKC is a family of serine-threonine kinases, composed of at
least 13 known isoforms with a wide range of tissue distribution, subcellular localization, and function. All PKC isoforms
contain a highly conserved COOH-terminal catalytic domain
and NH3-terminal regulatory domain with an autoinhibitory
pseudosubstrate sequence (20–22). It has been well established that the activation of the classic PKC isoforms (α, β1,
β2, and γ) requires Ca2+ and a phospholipid, such as diacylglycerol (DAG) or phosphatidylserine (PS). These PKC isoforms
also contain two cysteine-rich motifs within their NH2-terminal
regulatory domain that facilitate phorbol ester (TPA) interaction and subsequent activation. The novel isoforms (δ, ε, η,
μ, θ) are also activated by DAG and phorbol esters; however,
they lack a complete C2 domain responsible for Ca2+ interaction
and are therefore Ca2+ independent. The protein structures of
atypical PKC isoforms (ζ, ι/λ) differ from the other members
of the PKC family, missing both binding regions for Ca2+ and
DAG or phorbol esters. Activation of atypical isoforms is dependent on other phospholipids, such as PS, inositol lipids,
and phosphatidic acid.
Most PKC isoforms are present in the cytosol in nonstimulated cells. Upon stimulation, several PKC isoforms migrate
to the plasma membrane where interaction with DAG induces
full activation. A number of activated PKC isoforms can also
translocate to the nucleus where they can be targeted by lipid
coactivators or other activated protein kinases (23). Furthermore, some PKC isoforms such as PKCδ can be activated by
caspase-3 cleavage to release an active catalytic domain from
the inhibitory NH2-terminal regulatory domain.
Increased level of PKC or differential activation of PKC isoforms has been linked to a variety of cancers, including breast,
lung, thyroid, and adenomatous pituitary cancers as well as
leukemias (24, 25). There is emerging evidence that PKCs play
key roles in the regulation of cell growth, apoptosis, and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. Studies involving small interfering RNA knockdown and genetic disruption of individual
PKC isoforms in mice have shown that PKCα, β, λ, ε, and ζ
preferentially function to promote cell proliferation and survival, whereas PKCδ is a critical proapoptotic kinase in many
cell types (26).

To evaluate apoptin tumor-specific toxicity in hematologic
malignancies, we developed a lentiviral vector encoding a
green fluorescent protein–apoptin fusion gene (LV-GFP-AP)
that can be efficiently delivered into hematopoietic cells. This
strategy enabled us to identify novel apoptin-interacting cellular targets. Here, we provide strong evidence for the role of PKC
family kinases, particularly PKCβ variants, in apoptin phosphorylation and consequently its tumor-specific cytotoxicity.

Materials and Methods
Additional details about the materials and methods can be
found in the Supplementary Data.
Cell lines
MM1.S (dexamethasone-sensitive) and MM1.R (dexame‐
thasone-resistant) cell lines were obtained from Dr. Tai
(Dana-Farber, Boston, MA). K562 (BCR/ABL cytogenetics),
HL60 (TPA, retinoic acid differentiation), U937 (TPA differentiation), and KG1 (monosomy 7, trisomy 8 cytogenetics) leukemic cells were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection. NB4 (t15,17 translocation) was obtained from
German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures.
HCT116 (KRAS mutation analysis) was obtained from
Prof. Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD). All cell lines
were obtained since 2006 and were tested for cell line–specific
defects before batch freezing (see above for specific assays).
Cells are regularly tested to ensure the absence of Mycoplasma
contamination, and cell morphology is regularly checked to
ensure the absence of cross-contamination of cell lines.
Construction of lentiviral vector LV-GFP-AP, lentivirus
production, and titration
LV-GFP-AP was constructed by cloning GFP-apoptin derived
from pCMV-GFP-Ap (13) into the LV-GFP lentiviral construct
(27) through replacement of GFP by GFP-AP by blunt end ligation (see Supplementary Fig. S1A). Lentiviral vectors were
produced by cotransfection of 293T cells with the secondgeneration packaging plasmid pCMVΔ8.91 and plasmid
pMDG encoding VSV-G–pseudotyped envelope (27). The titer
of lentivirus was determined by quantification of viral core
protein p24 through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) using a HIV-1 p24 capture assay kit (Perkin-Elmer).
The values were normalized against a recombinant p24 protein standard. Virus numbers were then calculated based on
the fact that a viral particle contains 2,000 p24 molecules (28, 29).
Comparable virus titers, based on p24 ELISA, were achieved
for LV-GFP and LV-GFP-AP (Supplementary Table S2).
MTT proliferation
Leukemia cell lines were infected with LV-GFP or LV-GFPAP in the presence of 4 μg/mL polybrene. Cells were seeded
at 5 × 104, 104, and 103 per well in 96-well plates for MTT assays.
On days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 postinfection, 20 μL of 5 mg/mL
MTT in PBS were added to each well and samples were incubated for 2 to 4 hours. MTT solubilization solution (100 μL)
was then added, and samples were incubated overnight.
The optical density (OD) was measured, and the OD values

were converted into percentages of the control absorbance.
The average values were obtained from triplicates.
Flow cytometric analysis
Apoptosis was assessed by propidium iodide (PI) staining.
Briefly, cells were pelleted and resuspended in PBS with 20
μg/mL of PI. The settings for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis were based on unstained parental, GFPtransduced, and PI-stained control samples. The cells were
analyzed on a BD FACSCanto II (Becton Dickinson), and
10,000 events were acquired per sample. Fluorescence data
were analyzed by FlowJo software.
Methylcellulose colony-forming assay
Normal human bone marrow cells were obtained from volunteers undergoing open heart surgery at King's College
Hospital (Ethics Committee number 05-03-125). CD34+ cells
were isolated using anti-CD34+ microbeads, and an AutoMacs
fractionation device (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's instructions. CD34+ cells were cultured in Stemspan
serum-free medium with cytokine cocktail (StemCell Technologies) for 48 hours. Mobilized CD34+ cells were infected with
LV-GFP or LV-GFP-AP at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of
100. Two days postinfection, infected CD34+ cells were analyzed
for their progenitor function by an in vitro colony-forming
assay (StemCell Technologies).
Purification of maltose-binding protein–apoptin
fusion protein
Apoptin cDNA was cloned into pMALc2 (NEB) in frame
with the maltose-binding protein (MBP), and protein was
purified from BL21 codon plus E. coli cells (Stratagene) using
an Amylose Resin kit (NEB) according to the manufacturer's
recommendations.
Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting
For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer on ice with freshly added protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). The cell debris was removed,
and 2 μg of anti-GFP (Abcam) or anti-PKCβ1 antibody (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) were added to the cell lysate for 30 minutes at room temperature under constant agitation. Twenty
microliters of washed Bio-Adembeads PAG (Ademtech) were
added to the cell lysate with antibody for 2 to 3 hours at 4°C,
and complexes were pulled down using a magnet rack.
Proteins from different cell fractions were isolated using
the ProteoJET cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extraction
kit (Fermentas) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
For Western blotting, the proteins were separated on SDSPAGE gels, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (GE
Healthcare), and blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk for 1 hour
at room temperature. The membrane was incubated with a
specific primary antibody and a horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated secondary antibody and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) detection system and exposed
to ECL film (both from Amersham Biosciences). The blot was
stripped with ReBlot plus strong antibody stripping buffer
(Millipore) and reprobed with a different antibody as required.

Antibodies against Thr-108–phosphorylated apoptin or
total apoptin were raised in rabbit against peptides H2NSLITTT(PO3H2)PSRPRTA-CONH2 and H2N-SLITTTPSRPRTACONH2, respectively (Eurogentec). All antibodies used in the
study were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology except
antibodies against MERTK, DGKH, and GFP for immunoprecipitation, which were purchased from Abcam. Antibodies
against phospho-AKT-Ser-473, phospho-PKCβ2-Thr-638,
total AKT, PI3K/p85, caspase-3, caspase-9, and GFP for Western blotting were purchased from Cell Signaling.
In vitro kinase assay
Two micrograms of MBP-apoptin fusion protein were
added to 1× kinase buffer (Cell Signaling) containing 200
μmol/L ATP and 0.2 ng of PKCβ2 kinase (Cell Signaling) or
PKCβ1 pulled down from MM1.R cell lysate. The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. Reactions were carried out under different conditions, with kinase
or without kinase, with PKCβ-specific inhibitor (Calbiochem)
or AKT-specific inhibitor (Calbiochem). The reaction was
stopped by adding 2× loading buffer and boiling for 5 minutes.
Construction of plasmids encoding PKCβ catalytic
domains and transfection of 293T
The catalytic domains of PKCβ1 and PKCβ2 were PCR
amplified from cDNA derived from MM1.R cells and cloned
into the retroviral vector pBabePuro. The forward primer introduces a start codon in a Kozak context. The sequences were
verified, and the expression of the catalytic domain was verified by Western blotting of transfected cells with PKCβ1- and
PKCβ2-specific antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Immunohistochemistry and visualization by
fluorescence microscopy
HCT116-p53−/− or MM1.R cells (5 × 104) were infected
with a lentiviral vector. At day 2 or 5, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with antibody against PKCβ1 for 1 hour
and Texas red IgG secondary antibody for 1 hour. The cells
were washed and covered with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and visualized.
Statistical analysis
Student's t test was used to determine significance.

Results
Apoptin induces tumor-specific killing of leukemia cells
A panel of leukemia cell lines as well as primary CD34+ and
PBMC cells were infected with LV-GFP or LV-GFP-AP lentiviral vectors. In general, the leukemia cell lines were found to
be more sensitive to lentiviral infection than normal cells. In
particular, multiple myeloma MM1.R and MM1.S cells were
highly sensitive to infection, requiring only a MOI of 2 to
achieve 100% transduction (Supplementary Fig. S2A; MM1.S
cells have a comparable infectivity to the parental matched
MM1.R cells; data not shown). CD34+ cells were less sensitive,
requiring a higher MOI of 100 to obtain 50% to 80% transduction efficiency. Furthermore, higher expression levels of

Fig. S2B and C).
To examine apoptin-mediated cell death, 1 × 105 cells were
infected with equal MOIs for LV-GFP and LV-GFP-AP virus.
After 5 days, cell death was determined by FACS analysis
of PI-positive cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, GFP-apoptin triggered

apoptosis in transduced leukemia cells in a dose-dependent
manner, whereas no cell death was observed in untransduced
or GFP-transduced parental cells (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, MTT
cell survival assay showed more than 90% cell death in a panel
of leukemia cell lines infected with LV-GFP-AP, whereas no
significant killing was observed with LV-GFP–infected and uninfected parental cells (Fig. 1B). Using a MOI of 100, we were

able to infect more than 80% of CD34+ cells with LV-GFP and
more than 50% with LV-GFP-AP, respectively, but the transgene expression was 2 to 3 logs lower compared with the leukemia cells (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Nevertheless, after
infection with LV-GFP-AP, CD34+ cells remained viable and
maintained the same differentiation capacity as control LVGFP–infected and uninfected CD34+ cells on methylcellulose
colony-forming assay (Fig. 1C). This indicates that apoptinexpressing CD34+ cells function normally as hematopoietic
progenitors and can differentiate into multiple lineages. The
low infectivity, low expression, and lack of toxicity shown by
the transduced CD34+ and PBMC cells show an important
potential for LV-GFP-AP as a purging agent in autologous
bone marrow transplant for leukemia.

Identification of apoptin kinase(s) by
microarray analysis
Two variants of multiple myeloma cells, which originated
from the same patient, are characterized by resistance (MM1.R)
or sensitivity (MM1.S) to dexamethasone. Using a MOI of 2, we
showed that MM1.R cells were significantly more sensitive to
apoptin-induced cell death as assessed by MTT cell viability
and FACS analysis (Fig. 2A and B). Importantly, increased sensitivity of MM1.R cells to apoptin-induced cell death was associated with a higher level of apoptin phosphorylation (Fig. 2C)
detected by Western blot analysis using an apoptin phosphospecific antibody that we have recently developed.
Expression profiling by Affymetrix microarray analysis
showed the overexpression of several kinases in MM1.R cells

compared with MM1.S cells, including PKCβ (9 fold), c-mer
proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (MERTK, 5.9-fold), and diacylglycerol kinase (DGKH, 5.2-fold). The expression levels of PKCα
(1.6-fold), PKCγ (1.5-fold), and PKCδ (1.4-fold) were slightly
higher in MM1.R cells. In contrast, PKCε expression was higher
(3.2-fold) in MM1.S cells. The detailed microarray data are provided in the supplementary materials. The highest expressing
candidates PKCβ, MERTK, and DGKH were further validated
by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR) using Sybr
Green Taqman master mix and Western blot analysis (Fig. 2D).
These experiments confirmed the microarray analysis data.
PKCβ interacts and phosphorylates apoptin in vitro
and in vivo
To further investigate the role of the identified kinases in
the phosphorylation of apoptin, MM1.R cells were infected

with LV-GFP or LV-GFP-AP. After 3 days, total cell extracts
were immunoprecipitated with GFP antibody (Abcam).
Western blot analysis of the IP complexes detected a clear
IP of both PKCβ variants with GFP-apoptin fusion protein
but not with GFP alone. The precipitated complexes were
also analyzed using antibodies against DGKH, MERTK,
AKT, PI3K/p85, PKCα, and PKCδ, but none of these proteins
were found in the GFP-apoptin immunocomplex (Fig. 3A). The
reciprocal IP using anti-PKCβ1 (Fig. 3B) or PKCβ2 antibody
confirmed the interaction of the PKCβ variants with GFPapoptin.
To further investigate whether apoptin is phosphorylated
by PKCβ, bacterial recombinant apoptin fused to MBP
(MBP-apoptin) was used as substrate with either recombinant GST-PKCβ2 protein (Cell Signaling) or with immunopurified PKCβ1. Western blot analysis confirmed enhanced

MBP-apoptin phosphorylation by recombinant PKCβ2 (top) and PKCβ1 purified from MM1.R cell lysates by IP with a PKCβ1 antibody or an unspecific
antibody (lane 2, bottom). The lower bands are heavy chains from the IP cross-reacting with the secondary antibody. The phosphorylation of MBP-apoptin
is blocked by a PKCβ inhibitor, but not by an Akt inhibitor. D, increased phosphorylation of apoptin was detected in 293T cells 48 h after cotransfection of
LV-GFP-AP with pPKCβ1-CF and pPKCβ2-CF. Expression of PKCβ1 and PKCβ2 catalytic fragments in 293T cells was detected by Western blot using
PKCβ1- and PKCβ2-specific antibodies. The same membranes were reprobed with a phosphorylated apoptin-specific antibody and anti-GFP antibody.

phosphorylation of apoptin by both PKCβ1 and PKCβ2 (Fig.
3C). Furthermore, a PKCβ-specific inhibitor resulted in diminished apoptin phosphorylation, whereas an AKT-specific
inhibitor had no such effect. The activity of the AKT inhibitor
was confirmed by Western blot analysis of AKT phosphorylation in the presence or absence of AKT inhibitor on total cell
lysate from MM1.R cells (data not shown). The level of total
apoptin detected by the apoptin antibody showed that the total amount of MBP-apoptin supplemented was similar in different samples. To obtain evidence that the PKCβ isoforms
also phosphorylated apoptin in cells, we coexpressed apoptin
with the catalytic domains of PKCβ1 and PKCβ2 (pPKCβ1-CF
or pPKCβ2-CF) or control pBabePuro in 293T cells. At 48
hours after transfection, total cell extracts were separated
on SDS-PAGE and protein expression was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-PKCβ1 or anti-PKCβ2 antibodies.
The catalytic domain fragments (CF) of both PKCβ
isoforms were detected by Western blotting with PKCβ
variant–specific antibodies (Fig. 3D). In agreement with the
in vitro data, overexpression of PKCβ-CF resulted in a significant increase in apoptin phosphorylation. In contrast, apoptin
was weakly phosphorylated by cotransfection with the empty
vector control, representing the basal phosphorylation levels
in 293T cells. Anti-GFP antibody was used on the same blot

to show similar expression levels of GFP-apoptin in different
samples. Furthermore, cell death was increased when exogenous PKCβ1-CF or PKCβ2-CF were coexpressed with apoptin
(Fig. 3D).
shRNA-mediated knockdown or drug inhibition of
PKCβ activity inhibits apoptin phosphorylation
To further show a causal link between PKCβ and apoptin
phosphorylation, MM1.R cells were infected with LV-GFP-AP
and lentiviral vectors expressing shRNA against PKCβ. The
successful knockdown of endogenous PKCβ1 and PKCβ2
protein levels by shRNA was shown by Western blotting
(Fig. 4A). A strong reduction in apoptin phosphorylation
was observed at 3 days after transduction with shRNA.
However, FACS analysis of PI-positive cells showed increased
rather than decreased cell death in cells coexpressing apoptin
together with PKCβ shRNA (Supplementary Fig. S3A and B).
This is not surprising as PKCβ isoforms are known to play an
important role in cell proliferation and their inhibition is likely
to suppress cellular growth. Moreover, we examined PKCβmediated apoptin phosphorylation using PKCβ-specific or
AKT-specific inhibitors (Fig. 4B). We found that apoptin phosphorylation was reduced 3 days after treatment with PKCβ
inhibitor or AKT inhibitor. However, PKCβ inhibition

knockdown resulted in reduced apoptin
phosphorylation. MM1.R cells were coinfected with
lentiviral vector encoding GFP-apoptin and lentiviral
construct encoding either shRNA-con (no homology to
human genome), or shRNA-F3 and shRNA-F5 directed
against PKCβ. The levels of phosphorylated apoptin

blotting of cell lysates obtained 3 d after infection. The
same blot was probed to detect phosphorylated
apoptin, GFP-apoptin, PKCβ1, PKCβ2, and γ-tubulin.

decreased phosphorylation of apoptin considerably more
than inhibition of AKT. These results collectively suggest that
PKCβ is an important apoptin kinase, but other intricate
pathways may be involved in apoptin phosphorylation and
regulation of its activation.
Apoptin differentially regulates cellular kinases and
kinase activities
We further studied the effect of apoptin on the expression and activation of other cellular candidate kinases,
which were either reported to play a role in the apoptin
activity or were identified in our microarray expression
profiling.
Infection of MM1.R cells with either control LV-GFP or
LV-GFP-AP resulted in a time-dependent increase of GFP
or GFP-AP expression. However, apoptin expression resulted
in a decreased expression of MERTK and AKT as normalized
to γ-tubulin (Fig. 5A). PKCβ1 and PKCβ2 protein levels remained unchanged, but increased phosphorylated PKCβ1,
PKCβ2, and AKT were detected in total cell extracts. Meanwhile, elevated levels of PKCβ1 and β2 in cytoplasmic membrane and nuclear fractions, representing kinase activities,
were also detected in the apoptin-transduced cells (Fig. 5B).
Interestingly, apoptin expression also induced cleavage of
caspase-9, caspase-3, and PKCδ, which correlated with apoptininduced cell death.
Furthermore, we found that in tumor cells, the cytosolic
fraction of the apoptin protein was not phosphorylated,
whereas the plasma membrane-bound, nuclear, and nuclear membrane–associated apoptin protein was significantly
phosphorylated. These data indicate that phosphorylation
plays an important role in the subcellular localization of
apoptin (see Fig. 5B). These membranes are the sites
where PKCβ is considered to be active (not in the cytosol;
ref. 30). Similar results were obtained with different cell
lines infected with LV-GFP-AP (data not shown), suggesting that apoptin is phosphorylated by the activated PKCβ
at cellular membranes.
It is widely accepted that the biological functions of PKC
isoforms depend on their intracellular localization. PKC isoforms can be localized to multiple cellular compartments,
including the plasma membrane, endosomes, endoplasmic
reticulum, Golgi, nucleus, and nuclear membrane. To study
the subcellular localization of PKCβ, MM1.R and p53deficient HCT116 cells (sensitive to apoptin killing) were
infected with LV-GFP (MOI 2) or LV-GFP-AP (MOI 8), respectively. The untransduced and GFP-transduced HCT116
cells showed a low level of cytosolic distribution of PKCβ,
whereas the apoptin-transduced HCT116 cells had increased
cytosolic levels and nuclear import of PKCβ (Fig. 5C). In the
untransduced and GFP-transduced MM1.R cells, PKCβ
mostly concentrated near the nucleus in a pattern that resembled the endoplasmic reticulum. In apoptin-transduced
MM1.R cells, activated PKCβ relocated to the nuclear membrane and also translocated into the nucleus, colocalizing
with apoptin. Apoptin-expressing MM1.R cells clearly
showed condensed apoptotic nuclei on day 5 postinfection
(Fig. 5D).

Discussion
Recently, several viral and cellular proteins that specifically
kill tumor cells have been identified. Such proteins as well as
their cellular interacting and regulatory targets are important
candidates for anticancer therapeutics. In the present study,
we have identified a novel cellular pathway involved in the
sensitization of cancer cells to apoptin.
Apoptin has been shown to be predominantly localized in
the nucleus of cancer cells, whereas in normal cells its nuclear
accumulation is severely impaired (13, 14). Several studies
indicated that phosphorylation of apoptin is crucial for its
nuclear localization and cytotoxic activity (9, 10). Here, we
provide evidence that the phosphorylation and nuclear migration of apoptin in tumor cells is mediated by PKCβ. Deletion
and point mutation studies have shown the importance of the
COOH-terminal domain (amino acids 80–121) of apoptin for
its nuclear accumulation and function (31–34). Apoptin was
shown to be phosphorylated in this domain predominantly
at Thr-108 in cancer cells (16, 17). Analysis of the apoptin amino acid sequence for potential phosphorylation sites using
NetPhos software (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos)
indicated seven putative phosphorylation sites corresponding
to the PKC kinase consensus motifs (S/TXK/R or S/TXXK/R).
These sites included Thr-108, which has been previously
shown to be phosphorylated in tumor cells but not in normal
cells (31, 32). Microarray expression profiling of multiple myeloma
cell lines with different sensitivity to apoptin identified the
PKCβ family as potential tumor-specific apoptin kinases. Our
in vitro and in vivo kinase studies and the knockdown of PKCβ
further confirmed that apoptin was phosphorylated by PKCβ.
Ludwig and colleagues have recently shown that virus infection or the treatment with the viral protein hemagglutinin
resulted in a rapid activation of PKC isoforms (35). Furthermore, besides the well-established role of PKCs in activating
the downstream RAF/MEK/ERK kinases, PKCs have been
found to directly phosphorylate several viral proteins (36, 37).
Our study provides further evidence that PKCβ may be an important cellular component that interacts with viral proteins
including apoptin. Consequently, PKCβ phosphorylates apoptin and triggers its nuclear migration where it induces the activation of multiple signaling events, involving caspase-9,
caspase-3 activation, and cleavages of PKCδ, shifting the equilibrium from survival signaling toward the activation of the
cell death machinery.
Recently, apoptin has been shown to interact with the SH3
domain of p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K and its downstream effector AKT kinase (18, 19, 38). Interestingly, the interaction of apoptin with AKT seems to trigger the nuclear
trafficking of AKT in parallel with apoptin, resulting in the
AKT-mediated phosphorylation of downstream mitogenic
cyclin-dependent kinase CDK2 and consequent phosphorylation of apoptin by CDK2 in the nucleus. However, in this
study, we have been unable to show an interaction between
apoptin and either the p85 subunit of PI3K or AKT, but we
could not entirely rule out the involvement of PI3K/AKT
pathway in apoptin phosphorylation either. Particularly, inhibition with an AKT inhibitor showed decreased apoptin

phosphorylation to some extent. In our study, apoptin expression resulted in AKT activation and rapid AKT protein
degradation, which may prevent detection due to a sensitivity problem. The inconsistencies between our study and that
of Maddika and colleagues could be due to the different intrinsic cell features in the cell types used. MCF7 cells, which
they used in their experiments, have previously been shown
by others to be caspase-3 deficient (39). It has been reported
that AKT kinases are functionally inactivated by caspase-3
cleavage in response to a variety of apoptotic stimuli and
growth factor withdrawal (40, 41). A nuclear translocation of
AKT with apoptin in MCF7 cells reported by Maddika and colleagues could therefore be due to the lack of cleavage of AKT in
the caspase-3–deficient MCF7 cells, resulting in a full-length,
active AKT that could capture and accompany apoptin into
the nucleus.
In contrast to AKT, which was destabilized by apoptin, a
consistent, stable PKCβ protein level was detected in MM1.R
cells. It is generally accepted that the transient activation of
PKCs supports cell survival, whereas a sustained activation of
PKCs induces apoptosis (21). Activation of PKCs in certain leukemia cell lines (HL60, U937, and K562) by TPA has been shown
to be associated with growth arrest and terminal differentiation
(42–44). This effect is also often accompanied by apoptosis.
Controlled cellular proliferation involves multiple mechanisms that balance increased cell numbers with subsequent
cell death. This complex process is orchestrated by many kinases and caspases (45). We observed increased cleavage of
caspase-9, caspase-3, and PKCδ during apoptin-induced cell
death in myeloma cell lines. Active caspase-8 or caspase-9 can
directly cleave and activate effector caspases, such as caspase-3,
and/or engage the intrinsic apoptotic pathway through the
cleavage of the Bcl-2 homology 3 protein Bid (46). Cleaved
Bid translocates to the mitochondria, where it triggers activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway by promoting activation of the Bcl-2 proteins Bax and Bak, which induces loss of
mitochondrial membrane potential and release of proapoptotic mitochondrial components into the cytoplasm. PKCδ is a
well-characterized and ubiquitously expressed kinase with
multiple functions (47). Full-length PKCδ is located in the cytoplasm and has been shown to promote cell proliferation,
whereas cleaved PKCδ is located in the nucleus and has proapoptotic functions. Exposure to numerous apoptotic stimuli
results in the activation of PKCδ and its translocation to the
nucleus. Our data indicate that apoptin activates both PKCδ
and caspase-3 and enhances their nuclear accumulation (data
not shown). In the nucleus, PKCδ seems to be cleaved by activated caspase-3 to generate the constitutively activated
proapoptotic cleaved form (48). Potential target substrates
of PKCδ are nuclear proteins that are involved in apoptotic

cell death such as lamin B (nuclear structural protein),
DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), Rad9 (cell cycle
checkpoint protein), p53, p73β, and STAT1 (transcription factors; refs. 20, 23, 47). Taken together, our data suggest that
cleavage of PKCδ and caspase-3 is also involved in the regulation of apoptin-mediated apoptosis, but downstream of
apoptin. This is consistent with previous reports showing that
caspase-3 is required for apoptin-induced apoptosis (12).
Cancer remains one of the leading causes of death, and
many cancer patients relapse as they become resistant to
conventional therapies. There is mounting evidence that cancer cells, including leukemia, have an intrinsic ability to prevent apoptosis (49). Here, we provide important evidence
that the ectopic expression of apoptin can restore the failing
apoptosis program in leukemia and overcome intrinsic or acquired resistance to cell death. Furthermore, apoptin was
able to effectively eliminate multiple myeloma cells that
had become resistant to dexamethasone. This study has led
to the identification of tumor-specific cellular targets such as
PKCβ, whose modulation by shRNAs and small-molecule
drugs can induce strong antileukemia effects.
In conclusion, the present study provides novel mechanisms for apoptin regulation by protein phosphorylation involving the PKC pathway. This knowledge can be applied
to understanding the role of these kinases in response to
treatment with a variety of anticancer agents. Importantly,
the evidence that our newly developed lentiviral vector expressing apoptin has no effect on CD34+ progenitor colony
formation while effectively killing multiple myeloma cells further supports apoptin as an important and ideal ex vivo
purging agent in the autologous bone marrow transplantation for human multiple myeloma.
