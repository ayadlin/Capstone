ABSTRACT
Gene amplifications are mostly an attribute of tumor cells and drug resistant
cells. Recently, we provided evidence for gene amplifications during differentiation
of human and mouse neural progenitor cells. Here, we report gene amplifications in
differentiating mouse myoblasts (C2C12 cells) covering a period of 7 days including
pre-fusion, fusion and post-fusion stages. After differentiation induction we found an
increase in copy numbers of CDK4 gene at day 3, of NUP133 at days 4 and 7, and of
MYO18B at day 4. The amplification process was accompanied by gamma-H2AX foci
that are indicative of double stand breaks. Amplifications during the differentiating
process were also found in primary human myoblasts with the gene CDK4 and NUP133
amplified both in human and mouse myoblasts. Amplifications of NUP133 and CDK4
were also identified in vivo on mouse transversal cryosections at stage E11.5. In the
course of myoblast differentiation, we found amplifications in cytoplasm indicative of
removal of amplified sequences from the nucleus. The data provide further evidence
that amplification is a fundamental mechanism contributing to the differentiation
process in mammalians.

produce characteristic muscle proteins. During early
myogenesis there is evidence for double strand breaks
of unknown origin in C2C12 cells [10]. Fork collapse
at stalled replication forks play a role in the formation
of double strand breaks [11] and both double strand
breaks and fork collapse are likely accompanying the
amplification process.
Here, we analyzed amplification during the
differentiation of skeletal muscle. Our previous studies
on gene amplification in non-malignant mammalian cells
indicated that physiological amplification events may
not only be restricted to small time windows but also
to small number of cells. In the light of this finding, we
used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to detect
gene amplifications on single cell level. In addition, we
used qPCR to monitor amplification over a time window
of several days. The extended time window was selected
to cover myogenic differentiation steps. A study from
Hayward et al 1986 on primary chicken embryo myoblasts
distinguished between prefusion stage (0-36h), fusion
stage (48-72) and postfusion stage (more than 72h) [12].

INTRODUCTION
For almost 30 years gene amplifications have
been known in the development of amphibians and flies
[1]. We recently reported gene amplifications during
differentiation in human and mouse neural stem and
progenitor cells [2, 3]. These studies raise the questions
if gene amplification is a fundamental and widespread
mechanism during the differentiation process. To further
address this issue we searched for amplification during
the differentiation of the skeletal muscle. Previously it
was hypothesized that a strong increase of alpha-actin
gene expression during chicken myoblast differentiation
may result from a gene amplification mechanism [4].
Differentiation of skeletal muscle cells is a highly
organized process with myoblasts differentiating from
mononucleate cells to multinucleate myotubes and finally
to mature myotubes. C2C12 cells derived from a mouse
myoblast cell line [5, 6] were used in many studies that
analyzed myogenic differentiation [7–9]. These cells
differentiate rapidly, form contractile myotubes and

In mouse C2C12 myoblasts maximal fusion is detectable

amplification we searched for accompanying double
strand break repair during myogenesis. We further set out
to confirm our results on primary human myoblasts and in
vivo on mouse cryosection.

performed FISH on C2C12 cells at days 3-7 following
differentiation inductions. The above time points were
selected to span the mouse myoblasts fusion process that
starts with the prefusion stage (0-36h), followed by the
fusion stage (48-72), and that is completed after 72h to
96h [12, 13].
In the FISH analysis BAC NUP133/ACTA1
identified a strong amplification in C2C12 myoblasts four
days and seven days after induction of differentiation
(Figure 1b–1d). Amplification of MYO18B was detected
in C2C12 cells four days after differentiation induction
(Figure 1b), and amplification of CDK4 three days after
differentiation induction (Figure 2b,c). Amplification
frequencies of CDK4, NUP133, and MYO18B have been
determined by analyzing 100 nuclei each (Table 1).

RESULTS
Amplification of ACTA1, NUP133, MYO18B and
CDK4 in single cells during mouse myogenesis
We analyzed C2C12 cells (ATCC), which represent
a subclone generated from a mouse myoblast cell line [5,
6]. To search for gene amplification in single cells we
used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on cells
differentiating to myotubes over a period of seven days.
We selected chromosome regions that harbor genes that
were previously shown to be involved in myogenesis
and/or to specifically show increased expression during
myogenic differentiation. The chromosomal regions
included 8qE2 containing ACTA1/NUP133, 5qF
containing MYO18B and 10qD3 containing CDK4. It was
previously shown that alpha-actin (ACTA1) and MYO18B
expression increased during myogenic differentiation
[13, 14]. CDK4 was reported as amplified in tumors of
myogenic origin [15]. In detail, the following BACs were
used for FISH analysis: BAC RP23-446H16 containing
genes ACTA1 and NUP133, RP23-6J9 containing
MYO18B and RP23-432F11 containing CDK4. In
addition, as reference we used BAC RP23-132P5 that
contained TERT which was previously not associated
with myogenic processes. We define a copy number of
the test gene as normal when both the number of signals
corresponded to the genome ploidy and its fluorescence
spot size equaled the spot size of the reference gene. An
amplified copy number is defined by an increased signal
number and/or by an increased fluorescence spot size of a
test gene compared to the reference gene. FISH analysis
on undifferentiated C2C12 cells revealed 3 signals for
ACTA1/ NUP133, 4 signals for MYO18B, 4-5 signals
for CDK4, and 4 signals for TERT gene. Representative
hybridization results of undifferentiated C2C12 nuclei
are shown in Figures 1a and 2a. These results are
consistent with the known near-tetraploid karyotype
of C2C12 cells [16]. For amplification analysis we

Amplification of ACTA1, NUP133, MYO18B
and CDK4 identified by qPCR during
mouse myogenesis
After having identified gene amplifications in
single cells, we used qPCR analysis (TaqMan) for the
detection of amplification in DNA isolated from cells
at two time points before differentiation induction
(day zero and day 2) and seven time points after
differentiation induction (1-7days) (Figure 3). The
two time points before differentiation induction were
included to identify possible gene amplification during
normal cell culture i.e. cell culture without induction
of differentiation. Since our FISH analysis showed
amplifications only in smaller numbers of cells, qPCR,
which analyzes all cells at each time point indicates such
amplifications by a comparable small increase of copy
numbers. There was a copy number increase of CDK4
as compared to other genes prior to differentiation
induction indicating an additional chromosome 10. This
is consistent with our FISH results in undifferentiated
cells that revealed 4-5 signals for CDK4. Following
differentiation induction CDK4 showed a constant
increase in copy number from day 1 to day 4. At day
5 there was a decrease in copy number of CDK4 back
to the level that was found prior to the differentiation
induction. A less pronounced but still detectable copy
number increase was found for the gene NUP133. Here,
the copy number increase was detectable after 2 days
of differentiation induction and remained at moderate
levels through days 3 to 7. PCR did not indicate copy

number increase for MYO18B. While the FISH analysis
detected a MYO18B amplification, the number of cells
that harbor this amplification was apparently too low
for a detection of an overall increased copy number
by qPCR.
For ACTA1 we found no evidence for amplification
but a slight copy number decrease both in undifferentiated
cells and throughout the differentiation process. This
finding was confirmed by two ACTA1 specific TaqMan
assays. The reduced copy number likely reflects a lower
chromosome 8q number, which was also indicated by three
fluorescence signals per nucleus in FISH experiments as
compared to the four fluorescence signals per nucleus
in FISH experiments of the reference TERT on mouse
chromosome 13qC1.

To confirm gene amplifications in an independent
species we analyzed primary human myoblasts (HSkM;
Invitrogen) by FISH. We used BAC RP4-679K16 that
includes NUP133 and ACTA1 both of which are localized
on human chromosome 1, BAC RP11-571M6 that includes
CDK4, and BAC RP11-611O2 that includes MDM2. Both
CDK4 and MDM2 are localized on human chromosome
12. Alpha-centromere probes from chromosome 1 (D1Z5)
and chromosome 12 (D12Z3) were used as references for
non-amplified sequences. Representative hybridizations
results for NUP133, CDK4 and MDM2 with corresponding
centromere probe are shown in Figure 4 a-c. We found

FISH was used to analyze gene amplifications of two chromosomal loci (MYO18B in BAC RP23-6J9 and ACTA1/NUP133 in BAC RP23446H16) in nuclei from differentiation induced C2C12 mouse myoblast cells. In keeping with the known near tetraploid C2C12 karyotype,

primary myoblasts (4b). Amplifications of CDK4
were detected after 2 days of differentiation induction
(Figure 4d), amplifications of NUP133 after 3 days of
differentiation induction (Figure 4e), and amplifications
of MDM2 after 2 days of differentiation induction (Figure
4f). The amplification frequencies of CDK4, NUP133, and
MDM2 have been determined by analyzing 100 nuclei

fast following differentiation induction. Normal blood
lymphocytes (PB) served as control standard for a diploid
karyotype. As indicated above, qPCR, which analyzes
all cells at each time points indicates amplifications of
few cells by a comparable small overall increase of copy
numbers. A copy number increase was detectable for all
genes (NUP133, CDK4 and MDM2) after one day of
differentiation induction (Figure 5). NUP133 revealed the
highest copy number increase after 1d of differentiation
induction when seeded at high density. CDK4 revealed a
copy number increase after 1, 5 and 6 days. MDM2 revealed
the highest copy number increase of all genes tested.

remains to be elucidated. Using the combined analysis
of alpha-actin as differentiation marker and interphase
FISH of BACs for the above identified amplifications,
we localized amplified sequences during myogenic
differentiation. We found amplified gene signals not only
within the nucleus but also amplifications that localized
outside the nucleus. The signals in the cytoplasm that
stained positive for alpha-actin were found for genes
ACTA1/ NUP133 (Figure 6a and 6c). These cytoplasm
signals were found specifically at days 3, 4, and 5 after
differentiation induction. The presence of DNA outside
the nucleus was confirmed by DAPI staining (Figure
6b and 6d). These data provide evidence that cells
can eliminate amplifications from the nucleus during
myogenesis.
Using simultaneous FISH with ACTA1/NUP133BAC and MYO18B-BAC again revealed strong
fluorescence signals for ACTA1/NUP133 outside the
nucleus (Figure 7a) while less pronounced signal for
ACTA1/NUP133 were found in the nucleus. Likewise,
strong fluorescence signals outside and weak signals
inside the nucleus were found for CDK4. The signal
of the reference probes MYO18B (green) (Figure 7a)
and ANO4 (green) (Figure 7b) were only found in the
nucleus. Given that ANO4 and CDK4 were localized
on the same chromosome, the finding of strong CDK4
signals outside with ANO4 signals remaining in the

nucleus argues against a random exclusion of DNA
material.

Detection of double strand breaks, repair
and single-stranded DNA during myogenic
differentiation
There is evidence for double strand breaks detected
by gamma-H2AX foci in C2C12 cells[10]. We detected
gamma-H2AX foci in C2C12 at days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 after
differentiation induction with a decrease in frequency
after 4 days. Previous studies found disappearance of
gamma-H2AX foci after 2 days [10]. Evidence for DNA
repair in gamma-H2AX foci is indicated by localization
of 53BP1 protein in those foci [17]. We found 53BP1containing gamma-H2AX foci that are indicative for
double strand break repair after 2, 3 and 5 days of
differentiation induction in C2C12 cells. Representative
immunofluorescence (IF) staining for gamma-H2AX and
53BP1 in undifferentiated C2C12 cells (a, b) and after
3 days of differentiation induction (c, d) are shown in
Figure 8. Representative immunofluorescence staining
for gamma-H2AX and 53BP1 in undifferentiated
primary human myoblast cells (a,b) and after 2 days of
differentiation induction (c,d) are shown in Figure 9.
The detection of amplification and gamma-H2AX foci
during myogenic differentiation is consistent with the

analyzed at seven time points after differentiation induction. These time points are indicated with DM (differentiation medium). ACTA1
showed no amplifications in two independent TaqMan assays (light blue and dark blue). Likewise, MYO18B showed no amplifications
(orange). CDK4 showed a copy number gain after one day of differentiation induction and the highest copy number gain after 4 days of
differentiation induction (green). NUP133 showed a copy number gain at days 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 after differentiation induction (purple).

replication stress.

basis of dermomyotome development with myoblasts and
early differentiating muscle cells, we selected embryonic
stage E11.5 for the amplification analysis. Using FISH on
cryosections from the mouse embryo we found evidence
for an amplification of both ACTA1/NUP133 and CDK4 in
the dermomyotome (Figure 11).

Correlation of gene amplification and double
strand breaks
Using a combined FISH-IF protocol, we analyzed
whether C2C12 cells bearing gene amplifications also
show an increased number of double strand breaks.
C2C12 cells were differentiation induced for 4 days and
first stained for gamma-H2AX. Subsequently, slides
were used for FISH analysis with BAC-probes specific
for ACTA1/NUP133 and CDK4. Representative gammaH2AX foci are shown in an overview picture with the
results of FISH analysis shown in enlarged display
windows. We found an overlap of cells with gammaH2AX foci and cells with gene amplifications (Figure 10).

DISCUSSION
Gene amplification is well known as mechanism
to elevate gene copy numbers during the development
of amphibians and flies [1]. Recently we reported gene
amplification during neural differentiation providing
first evidence that gene amplification as a physiological
mechanism is also established in mammals [2, 3].
Previous reports showed strongly increased alpha-actin
gene expression during chicken myoblast differentiation
[4]. Although the authors suggested gene amplification as
likely cause for differential expression of alpha-actin gene
during chicken myogenesis they could not reproducibly
demonstrate amplification of alpha-actin gene during
chicken myogenesis [12]. To follow up these findings, we
analyzed gene amplification of alpha-actin (ACTA1) in

In vivo analysis of gene amplification
To provide further evidence for a physiological role
of gene amplification, we analyzed ACTA1/NUP133 and
CDK4 for in vivo amplifications in mouse embryos. On the

myoblasts after induction of differentiation. For our FISH
analysis we used a BAC probe for a genomic region that
harbors the genes ACTA1 and NUP133. While NUP133
was confirmed to be amplified by using qPCR, qPCR
failed to confirm the gene amplification of ACTA1 that is
localized 10 kb apart from NUP133. The increased gene
expression of ACTA1 during myoblast differentiation is
likely due to other mechanisms than gene amplification.
Nevertheless, our results confirmed the amplification
of the genomic region including the genes ACTA1 and
NUP133 during myogenic differentiation.
Since gene amplifications in mammals are
largely known from tumors, it appeared legitimate
to analyze genes, which are amplified in tumors for
a possible amplification in a physiological context.
Previous studies specifically suggested a relationship
between gene amplification during tumor development
and gene amplification during differentiation. We
recently reported several genes that were amplified
both in glioblastoma development and during neuronal
progenitor cell differentiation [2]. A recent study reported
ERBB2 amplification during extravillous trophoblast
differentiation and indicated a similar amplification event
in the persistent gestational trophoblastic disease, which is
a trophoblast-originating tumor [18, 19].

Here, we tested whether genes that were amplified
in tumors of myogenic origin were also amplified during
myogenic differentiation. CDK4 and MDM2 were
amplified in leiomyosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma [15,
20]. We detected CDK4 and MDM2 amplification during
myogenesis of human primary myoblast cells (HSkM)
and CDK4 amplification during myogenesis of mouse
C2C12 cells. As for the scenario that may explain gene
amplification both in the tumor and in the physiological
context, stem cells or progenitor cells could possibly
develop into tumor cells while maintaining their capacity
for gene amplification. Alternatively, tumor cells may
regain stem cell properties including the ability for gene
amplification.
Regarding the mechanism of gene amplification,
the process underlying the amplification in normal cells is
likely different from the amplification mechanism known
for mammalian tumor cells. The breakage-fusion-bridgecycle model hypothesizes the collection of multiple copies
by subsequent cycles in the course of cell divisions [21].
In differentiating cells the copy numbers are increased
independent from cell division. The increase in normal
cells may be due to multiple firing of replication origins
and endocycling as reported for Drosophila [22]. One
of the first models of gene amplifications that were

gene in the Taqman assays and DNA from normal blood lymphocytes (PB) served as standard for normal diploid copy number. Copy
numbers are shown as mean from four technical replicates with vertical lines indicating the range. Undifferentiated HSkM cells served as
controls at day zero (0d). Differentiation induced HSkM cells were analyzed at six time points after differentiation induction. HSkM cells
were also analyzed with a high seeding density after 1 day of differentiation induction (1dmax). CDK4 showed the highest copy number
after 6 days of differentiation induction (green). NUP133 showed the highest copy number gain at day one after differentiation induction
with cells seeded at high density (1dmax) (blue). MDM2 showed copy number gains in undifferentiated HSkM cells and the highest copy
number gain at days one, five and six each after differentiation induction (yellow).

hypothesized more than 30 years ago described an "onionlike" structure created by unscheduled re-replication in
a replication bubble [23]. In our study, the clusters of
frequently enlarged FISH signals in the nucleus suggest a
re-replication mechanism. This hypothesis awaits further
experimental confirmation.
Recent studies report massive genomic
rearrangements in a single event in tumor cells referred to
as chromothripsis [24]. This phenomenon is accompanied
by DNA breaks, chromosome pulverization, and
micronuclei formation [25, 26]. If and to what extend
chromothripsis and gene amplification are related remains
to be determined. Amplification may occur in the process of
chromothripsis or alternatively chromothripsis may result
from an unfinished and derailed amplification process at
multiple replication origins in tumor cells. Although we
have limited information on an overall genome involvement

in the amplification process of differentiating myoblasts, we
have evidence for a genome-wide amplification in normal
neuronal progenitor cells. As of now, there is, however, no
evidence for a role of chromothripsis in the amplification
process in differentiating myoblasts.
Regarding the fate of amplified gene in
physiological processes, amplified chorion DNA is
removed by cell death of follicle cells in Drosophila.
We did not find evidence for cell death as a general
mechanism to remove sequences amplified during C2C12
myogenic differentiation. We found, however, evidence
for the removal of amplified DNA from the nucleus.
Using simultaneous FISH and IF we identified cells
with amplified DNA not only in the nucleus but also in
the cytoplasm of differentiation induced C2C12 cells.
Specifically, we found intense fluorescence signals for
NUP133 and CDK4 but not for the reference genes ANO4

and MYO18B outside the nucleus, arguing for a selective
exclusion of amplified sequences.
The determination of the general amplification
frequency in differentiating cells remains challenging.
First, at present the amplification frequency has been
determined only for few genes; second, co-amplifications
and heterogeneous cell population complicates an exact
calculation. An indirect indication of amplification
frequency can be made from cells with double strand
breaks. After 4 days of differentiation induction 85% of
cells revealed double strand breaks suggesting that these
cells are involved in gene amplifications. We also clarify
that this is a descriptive analysis and further functional
proof is required to support a causative link between
amplification and double strand breaks.
Genome wide DNA damage/strand breaks are
known to occur during differentiation. Induced reduction
of strand break formation leads to complete blockade
of differentiation in myoblasts [10]. Our analysis

confirmed the presence of double strand breaks (DSB)
and provided evidence for DSB repair during myogenic
differentiation. In addition, we were able to demonstrate
that cells with gene amplifications simultaneously
harbor DSBs. Our finding may also help to explain the
persistence of amplifications in tumor cells. Tumor cells
may have lost the stem cell ability to repair double strand
breaks and the ability to exclude amplified DNA from
the nucleus. Consistent with this idea is our finding,
that genes that are amplified during developmental
processes remain amplified in tumors. Examples include
CDK4, which is amplified in neural progenitor cells and
myoblasts during differentiation and ERBB2, which is
amplified in differentiating trophoblasts. These genes
were also amplified in tumors of the same origins
including glioblastoma, leiomyosarcoma and trophoblast
originating tumors. As for now, we are just at the very
beginning of an understanding of the complex scenarios
of gene amplification processes in a physiological context.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and differentiation
C2C12 (ATCC® CRL-1772TM) cells were grown in
DMEM with 10% FCS. Differentiation was induced with
change of the growth medium to DMEM supplemented
with 2% horse serum. Human primary myoblast cells
HSkM (Invitrogen) were grown in DMEM with 10%
FCS. Differentiation was induced with change of the
growth medium to DMEM supplemented with 2% horse
serum. For immunofluorescence and for fluorescence in
situ hybridization cells were grown on glass slides.

Figure 10: Double strand breaks and gene amplification in differentiation induced C2C12 cells. Combined

immunofluorescence assays and FISH were used to analyze the correlation between double strand breaks and amplification in C2C12 cells
at day four after differentiation induction. Gamma-H2AX foci are shown in red in the overview picture (e) in the center of the figure. FISH
analysis of NUP133 (pink) and CDK4 (white) is shown in the four outer pictures a-d, that represent enlarged portions of the overview
picture with each position indicated by a separate symbol (cross, asterisk, filled and empty triangle). There is an overlap of cells with
gamma-H2AX foci and cells with strong signals for NUP133 (pink) and/or CDK4 gene indicating amplifications of these genes. Nuclei
were counterstained with DAPI.

on glass slides and fixed in ice-cold methanol for 20
minutes. Human primary myoblast cells (HSkM) were
treated alike. Slides were washed in PBS for 5 minutes
and treated with 0.02% Tween-20 for 5 minutes. Slides
were RNase treated (100 µg/ml RNaseA in 2x SSC) for
1h at 37°C and pepsin treated (0.005% in 0.01 M HCl
at 37°C) for 10 minutes. Postfixation was performed
using 1% formaldehyde/1x PBS for 10 minutes at room
temperature. Hybridization and posthybridization washes
were as described previously [3].
For simultaneous fluorescence in situ hybridization
and immunofluorescence, differentiating C2C12 cells on
glass slides were fixed in ice-cold methanol for 20 minutes
and permeabilized with 0.2% Tween-20 for 5 minutes.
Postfixation was done by 1% formaldehyde/1x PBS for
10 minutes at room temperature. Slides were blocked
with goat serum, incubated for 1 h with rabbit antibody
monoclonal against muscle-Actin (ab156302, Abcam) and
detected using an Alexa-488 coupled secondary antibody
(Invitrogen). Finally, slides were dehydrated  by  an
ascending ethanol series (70%/80%/96%) and air-dried.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization
BAC clones were taken from the RP-11 (http://www.
chori.org/bacpac/) libraries of the Welcome Trust Sanger
Institute and available from SourceBioSciences, Germany.
BAC-DNA (1µg) was either labeled with Alexa-488dCTP (green fluorescence signals), with Alexa-555-dCTP
(yellow fluorescence) or with Alexa-594-dCTP (pink
fluorescence signals) using the FISHTag DNA labeling Kit
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Differentially
labeled probe DNAs (60 ng) were precipitated in the
presence of mouse or human Cot-1 DNA. Samples were
resuspended in hybridization mix (50% formamide,
2xSSPE, 10% dextrane sulphate and 4% SDS).
Differentiating C2C12 myoblast cells and control
non-differentiating C2C12 myoblast cells were grown

amplification in vivo on transversal cryosection from mouse abdominal region. The transversal cryosection is displayed as DAPI-stained
overview with the neural tube indicated (NT) a. The results of FISH experiments are visible in the enlarged section b. Amplification of
CDK4 (pink) and/or NUP133 (yellow) is indicated by enlarged signals and/or multiple signals for CDK4 and NUP133. TERT was used
as reference (green). Filled arrows indicate nuclei with NUP133 amplifications and open arrows nuclei with co-amplifications of NUP133
and CDK4. Individual cells with amplifications were detected in multiple regions of the developing myotome. Nuclei were counterstained
with DAPI. Size calibration bar is 100µm.
