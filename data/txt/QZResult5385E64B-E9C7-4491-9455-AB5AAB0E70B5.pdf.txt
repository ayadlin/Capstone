BACKGROUND. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that the inhibition of the
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway restores gefitinib sensitivity in resistant cancer cell
lines. A phase 1 study was conducted of the combination of everolimus, an
mTOR inhibitor, and gefitinib to determine a daily dose of everolimus with gefitinib in patients with advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

METHODS. Oral everolimus and gefitinib were both administered daily to patients
with progressive NSCLC. Patients were enrolled in 3-patient cohorts at everolimus dose levels of 5 and 10 mg daily. All patients received gefitinib 250 mg daily.

RESULTS. Ten patients were enrolled. The maximum tolerated dose of everolimus
was 5 mg when administered daily with gefitinib 250 mg. Two patients who were
treated at the 10 mg dose level of everolimus experienced dose-limiting toxicity,
including grade 5 hypotension and grade 3 stomatitis. Pharmacokinetic studies

demonstrated no consistent, significant interaction on the tmax, Cmax, and AUC0-8h
of either agent. Two partial radiographic responses were identified among the 8
response-evaluable patients.

CONCLUSIONS. For further study, everolimus at a dose of 5 mg daily in combination with daily gefitinib 250 mg is recommended. The 2 radiographic responses
identified are encouraging. A phase 2 trial in patients with NSCLC is under way.

he epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an important therapeutic target in the treatment of nonsmall-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). Gefitinib (Iressa, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, Wilmington, Del) and erlotinib (Tarceva, Genentech, South San Francisco,
Calif) selectively inhibit the tyrosine kinase located within the intracytoplasmic domain of EGFR and have demonstrated objective
responses in individuals with advanced NSCLC.1–3 Clinical predictors
of response to these agents include: smoking history (never-smokers),
pathology (adenocarcinoma, especially with bronchioloalveolar features), and enrollment in trials in East Asian countries.4 More
recently, somatic mutations within the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain
have been associated with sensitivity to the EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) gefitinib and erlotinib.5–7 Tumors from patients
with clinical predictors of response demonstrate a higher incidence
of EGFR mutations in exons 19 and 21.8 Tumor-specific features, such
as EGFR or HER2 gene amplification and EGFR protein expression,
may play a role as well.9–12
Despite insights into the basis of EGFR-TKI-sensitivity in NSCLC,
many patients treated with these agents fail to experience benefit.
KRAS mutations occur in 15% to 30% of patients with NSCLC and are
associated with primary resistance to these agents.13–15 For the

majority of patients with NSCLC whose tumors have
neither EGFR nor KRAS mutations, the mechanisms
for primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs are not understood. Dysregulation of downstream apoptotic pathways, such as the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/
Akt/phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) axis is a
potential explanation for resistance in these patients.16,17 PI3K mutations, PTEN deletions, PTEN silencing through promoter hypermethylation, and Akt
overexpression have been identified in 2% to 3%, 16%,
35%, and 60% to 70% of NSCLCs, respectively.18–21
Further supporting this hypothesis is the observation
that inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway restores gefitinib sensitivity in resistant cell lines.22
The mammalian target-of-rapamycin (mTOR) is a
serine-threonine kinase located downstream of Akt
and serves as a critical regulator of cellular growth
and proliferation. mTOR-dependent activity may be
essential for oncogenic transformation induced by
PI3K and Akt.23,24 Furthermore, mTOR inhibitors such
as rapamycin have been shown to cause G1 cell cycle
arrest in cancer cell lines and inhibit growth and
metastatic progression in NSCLC animal models.25
Everolimus (RAD001, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East
Hanover, NJ) is an oral mTOR inhibitor that has
undergone extensive clinical testing in the organtransplant setting.26,27 A recent phase 1 study of everolimus in patients with cancer identified 10 mg as a
biologically active dose, defined as the dose required
to inhibit its downstream effectors such as p70s6
kinase when administered on a daily schedule.28 Principle toxicities associated with everolimus include
rash, stomatitis, fatigue, leukopenia, and hypertriglyceridemia.
Our overall hypothesis is that concurrent signal
transduction inhibition within this pathway with gefitinib and everolimus would result in additive or synergistic antitumor activity in patients with advanced
NSCLC. As a first step to test this hypothesis we
designed and conducted this phase 1 trial.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility
All patients had pathologically confirmed NSCLC, either stage IIIB (with malignant effusion) or IV, or
recurrent disease. Eligibility requirements included:
progressive disease despite prior treatment with at
least 1 chemotherapy regimen including docetaxel
and either carboplatin or cisplatin; completion of
any prior treatment 4 weeks previous to study
entry; measurable or evaluable disease in a nonirradiated field; and a Karnofsky performance status of
70%. Laboratory parameters included: white blood

cell count (WBC) 3000/mL; hemoglobin 9 g/dL;
platelet count 100,000/mL; total bilirubin 1.5 3
the upper limit of normal (ULN); aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 1.5 3 ULN; and creatinine 1.5
3 ULN or creatinine clearance 60 mL/min. Patients
were excluded if they had brain metastases that
required escalating doses of corticosteroids; other
active cancer; prior treatment with any EGFR-directed therapy, such as an EGFR-TKI or antibody directed against EGFR; or were currently pregnant or
lactating. Fertile men or women not using effective
contraception were also ineligible. All patients provided written informed consent. This trial was
reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review
Board of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center.

Objectives and Definitions
The primary endpoint was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or to establish the safety
and tolerability of the final predefined dose level.
Patients who received 4 weeks of concurrent treatment with everolimus and gefitinib or those who
completed \4 weeks of concurrent treatment due to
drug toxicity were included in the analysis of drug
tolerability. Patients who developed progressive disease before completing 4 weeks of concurrent everolimus and gefitinib were replaced.
Treatment Plan
Two dose levels of everolimus were tested, 5 and
10 mg given orally once daily. All patients received oral
gefitinib 250 mg daily. Patients were enrolled in 3patient cohorts, with no intrapatient escalation. The
final dose level was predefined to include 6 patients
who completed 4 weeks of concomitant therapy.
Based on the half-life of everolimus and gefitinib, the
study was designed such that patients received a single dose of everolimus on Day 1, followed by initiation of daily gefitinib on Day 8 (Fig. 1). Patients then
began concurrent daily everolimus on Day 22.
Dose escalation was based on the toxicities
encountered through Day 28 of therapy. Toxicities
were graded using NIH Common Toxicity Criteria for
Adverse Events, v. 3.0. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)
was defined as any of the following: grade 3 diarrhea
lasting longer than 48 hours (despite loperamide);
grade 4 diarrhea; grade 3 rash; grade 3 fatigue lasting
more than 1 week; grade 4 hematologic toxicity;
grade 3 hypertriglyceridemia; any toxicity necessitating a 2-week treatment interruption; or any other
nonhematologic grade 3 or 4 toxicity. If DLT occurred
in 1 of the first 3 patients at a given dose level,
3 additional patients were treated at that dose level.

FIGURE 1. Study schema. Patients received a single dose of RAD001 on

pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential;
and baseline medical imaging that included computed tomography (CT) scanning of all relevant disease sites within 2 weeks of study entry. Patients
then provided an interval history and physical exam
weekly for the first 6 weeks and then every 4 weeks
starting in the 8th week. Laboratory evaluation, including complete blood count and serum chemistry, was
obtained in the 5th and 6th weeks and then every
4 weeks starting in the 8th week. Imaging with CT
scans was obtained in the 8th and 12th weeks, and
every 8th week thereafter.

Day 1, began daily gefitinib on Day 8, and then began concurrent RAD001
and gefitinib on Day 22. Serum samples for Karnofsky performance studies
were obtained on Days 1, 15, and 22, as depicted. Patients underwent initial
response assessment with computed tomography (CT) scan on Day 50, 4
weeks after starting concomitant therapy.

If no other patient experienced unacceptable toxicity,
dose escalation continued. If DLT occurred in 2 of 6
patients, dose escalation was stopped. The MTD was
defined as 1 dose level lower than the dose level at
which at least 2 of 6 patients experienced DLT.

Management of Toxicity, Dose Reductions, and
Interruptions
Patients were educated on the appropriate use of
loperamide for diarrhea.29 Management of grade 2 or
troublesome grade 1 rash included oral minocycline,
topical clindamycin, topical silver sulfadiazine, oral
diphenhydramine, or prednisone (short course).
Reduction or interruption of everolimus dosing
for adverse events was allowed at any time. The dose
of everolimus was reduced for any nondose-limiting
toxicity not controlled by optimal supportive measures. Patients were allowed a single dose reduction
on study. Those in the 5-mg dose cohort had everolimus discontinued; those in the 10-mg dose cohort
had dose reduction to 5 mg daily. Re-escalation was
not permitted. Dose interruptions for a maximum of
2 weeks were allowed if clinically indicated. Within 2
weeks after a dose interruption or reduction, study
drug-related toxicity must have improved by at least
1 grade and be grade 1.
Pretreatment and Follow-up Evaluations
At baseline all patients provided a history and underwent a physical examination, and laboratory evaluation including complete blood count, serum
chemistry (including total bilirubin, AST, alkaline
phosphatase, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen), and electrocardiogram within 2 weeks of study entry; serum

Pharmacokinetic Studies
Blood samples were obtained at 5 timepoints (immediately before, 1 hour after, 2 hours after, 5 hours after, and 8 hours after treatment) on Days 1, 15, and
22 (Fig. 1). Blood was separated and stored at 2208
C until analysis. Everolimus samples were sent frozen
to Novartis Pharmaceuticals SAS (Rueil-Malmaison,
France); gefitinib samples were sent frozen to Avantix
Laboratories (New Castle, Del). After liquid–liquid
extraction of the blood samples and evaporation of
the extracts, samples were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed using
WinNonlin 4.0 software (Pharsight, Mountain View,
Calif). Standard noncompartmental methods were
used to calculate the blood concentration vs time
curve within the dosing interval (AUC0-8h), peak serum concentration (Cmax), and the time at which
Cmax occurred (tmax).
Evaluation of Clinical Activity
All imaging studies were reviewed by a single reference radiologist (R.T.H.) who graded responses using
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST).30 All responses were confirmed with a followup scan 4 weeks later.
Gene Sequencing
Pretreatment tumor samples from patients with partial responses were analyzed for mutations within
KRAS exon 2 and EGFR exons 19 and 21 using methods previously described.7

Toxicity
None of the 3 patients who were initially treated with
4 weeks of concurrent therapy in the everolimus 5
mg dose level experienced DLT. After 2 of 3 patients
in the everolimus 10 mg dose level experienced DLT,
the initial 5 mg dose level was reexpanded. Selected
toxicities are presented in Table 2.
Everolimus 5 mg and Gefitinib 250 mg
Seven patients were enrolled at this dose level. One
patient developed symptomatic brain metastases
within the first week on study and was replaced. The
remaining 6 patients completed 4 weeks of concurrent everolimus and gefitinib.
No patient treated in this cohort required dose
interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of treatment due to toxicity. Among these 6 patients, treatment-related toxicities included grade 2 rash (n 5 1),
grade 1 rash (n 5 2), grade 2 stomatitis experienced as
discrete oral mucosal ulcerations (n 5 2), grade 1 stomatitis (n 5 1), grade 2 fatigue (n 5 3), grade 1 fatigue
(n 5 1), grade 1 diarrhea (n 5 5), grade 1 nausea and/
or emesis (n 5 2), and grade 2 pneumonia without
neutropenia (n 5 1). Two patients experienced grade 1
fever immediately after the first dose of everolimus. No
laboratory abnormalities thought to be possibly or
probably related to treatment were associated with
symptoms or clinically relevant findings. These toxicities included grade 3 lymphopenia, grade 2 lymphopenia, grade 1 thrombocytopenia, grade 1 anemia (all
with n 5 1), and grade 1 hypertriglyceridemia (n 5 3).
Everolimus 10 mg and Gefitinib 250 mg
Three patients were treated. Treatment-related toxicities included grade 5 hypotension with grade 3 creat-

inine and grade 4 acidosis and grade 3 hypokalemia
(n 5 1), grade 3 stomatitis with grade 2 weight loss
(n 5 1), grade 2 diarrhea (n 5 2), grade 2 hypertriglyceridemia (n 5 1), grade 1 rash (n 5 2), grade 1
fatigue (n 5 1), and grade 1 anemia (n 5 1). The
grade 5 hypotension occurred in the third patient enrolled at this dose level. This patient had metastatic
NSCLC with a large adrenal metastasis and a history
of prior pulmonary embolus for which she was
receiving daily enoxaparin. Fourteen days after starting concurrent everolimus and gefitinib, the patient
reported grade 2 diarrhea with minimal use of the
prescribed loperamide. Three days later the patient
presented to a local hospital with severe back pain,
lethargy, anorexia, and continued mild/moderate diarrhea. The patient was found to be tachypneic,
hypoxic, and experiencing new back pain of 10/10 in
severity. Studies identified prerenal azotemia and a
new right upper lobe infiltrate. Within an hour of
presentation she became hypotensive despite intravenous fluids. She elected to not be resuscitated and
died within 7 hours of presentation. At the time of
her death the differential diagnosis included pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, bowel ischemia,
tumor progression causing adrenal hemorrhage,
postobstructive pneumonia, and drug-related death.
Although her death appeared to be more plausibly
related to these other potential events, we could not
exclude the possibility that her death was a drugrelated event. Review of this patient’s pharmacokinetic data demonstrated no significant differences.
This episode and another patient’s grade 3 stomatitis
defined 2 separate DLTs within this dose level,
prompting this dose level’s closure.

Pharmacokinetics
Eight patients had complete pharmacokinetic studies
of everolimus and 9 gefitinib. One patient developed
symptomatic brain metastases within the first week
of treatment, was removed from the study, and as a
result had no Day 8 or 21 samples drawn. A separate
patient’s everolimus samples were unavailable for
study.
Table 3 displays the tmax, Cmax, and AUC0-8h of
everolimus after a single dose (Day 1) of everolimus
and after the addition of a single dose of everolimus
after patients had reached gefitinib steady-state (Day
22). The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) at
the 2 doses of everolimus averaged 20.45 ng/mL and
57.17 ng/mL, respectively. The everolimus AUC0-8h’s
obtained before gefitinib initiation were compared
with everolimus AUC0-8h’s obtained while patients
were on combination therapy with gefitinib. This
comparison demonstrated a mean decrease in evero-

changes in AUC0-8h demonstrates significant heterogeneity between patients. Among the 5 patients in
the everolimus 5 mg dose level, exposure to everolimus increased by 87% and 27% in 2 patients, and
decreased by 53% in 1 patient in the presence of
gefitinib. Gefitinib did not alter everolimus pharmacokinetics in the remaining 2 patients in this group.
Among the 3 patients in the everolimus 10 mg dose
level gefitinib did not alter everolimus pharmacokinetics in 2 out of 3 patients and increased the exposure to everolimus by 31% in 1 patient.
Neither dose of everolimus altered the steadystate pharmacokinetics of gefitinib in 6 of 9 patients,
whereas 3 patients (2 in the everolimus 5 mg group
and 1 in the everolimus 10 mg group) had increases
in the gefitinib AUC0-8h of approximately 30% in the

presence of everolimus. Table 4 demonstrates the
mean gefitinib AUC0-8h for gefitinib alone and after a
single dose of everolimus. No consistent, significant
change in the mean gefitinib AUC0-8h after a single
dose of everolimus was noted.

Eight patients underwent response assessments. Two
confirmed partial radiographic responses were identified, both treated at the everolimus 5 mg dose level.
These 2 patients were men with prior cigarette smoking histories of 25 and 45 pack-years, respectively.
One patient had a squamous cancer and the other
had an adenocarcinoma. In pretreatment tumor specimens no mutations that have previously been

DISCUSSION
The EGFR signaling pathway is an area of intense
investigation in NSCLC. Inhibition of the EGFR signaling pathway with the EGFR-TKIs gefitinib and
erlotinib has elicited impressive antitumor responses
in patients. Recent discoveries suggest that the presence of mutations in exons 19 and 21 of EGFR confer a high likelihood of sensitivity to these agents.
Unfortunately, these responses are confined to a minority of patients with advanced NSCLC. Targeting
the PI3k/Akt pathway in addition is a rational
approach to disrupt cancer cell growth beyond that
achieved with EGFR-TKI inhibition alone. Everolimus
inhibits mTOR, a downstream effector of Akt.
This trial demonstrates that oral daily everolimus
5 mg is tolerable when coadministered with oral
daily gefitinib 250 mg. Among the 6 patients who
received concurrent everolimus 5 mg and gefitinib
250 mg for 4 weeks, the adverse effects were mild/
moderate. The only toxicity identified within this
dose level that has not been reported previously is
grade 1 fever, experienced in 2 patients the night after receiving a single dose of everolimus and before
initiating gefitinib.
Everolimus 10 mg is thought to represent a biologically active dose with respect to inhibition of signaling through mTOR. When administered as a
single agent this dose of everolimus is safe and tolerable.28 Given their overlapping toxicities, it is not surprising that the 10 mg dose of everolimus was
intolerable when combined with gefitinib 250 mg.
Among patients treated in our study with everolimus
10 mg and gefitinib 250 mg, 2 experienced DLT.
The 2 radiographic responses in these patients
with chemotherapy-refractory, advanced NSCLC are
noteworthy. Neither of these 2 patients had clinical
or molecular predictors characteristic of gefitinibresponsive NSCLC.4,8 Both were male former smokers and 1 had a confirmed squamous carcinoma.

Whereas these responses may have been the result of
combined signal transduction inhibition with gefitinib and everolimus, it is also possible that they might
have happened with either agent alone. Indeed, responses to single-agent everolimus in NSCLC have
already been reported.28
Potential criticisms in the design of this study
include the limited dose escalation scheme and the
lack of correlative studies. We chose a priori to study
the 5 and 10 mg everolimus dose levels without further dose escalation based on extensive prior studies
that have suggested that everolimus 10 mg daily
would result in maximal mTOR inhibition as gauged
by p70S6 kinase and p-eLF4G inhibition.28 Further
everolimus escalation beyond this dose level risks
added toxicity without enhancing mTOR inhibition.
Based on these results, the combination of gefitinib and everolimus for patients with advanced
NSCLC is being assessed in a phase 2 trial at our
institution. Enrollment in this trial requires submission of pretreatment tumor specimens. Correlative
studies will include immunohistochemical assessment of PTEN, EGFR, HER2, p-Akt, and p70S6 kinase
expression, as well as sequencing of EGFR exons 19
and 21 and KRAS exon 2. The larger number of
patients and the inclusion of these correlative studies
will allow better characterization of the molecular
basis of responses to combined EGFR and mTOR inhibition and provide the opportunity to confirm the
efficacy of the combination of everolimus and gefitinib observed in this trial.
