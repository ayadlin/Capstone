MYC selects against reduced BCL2A1/A1 protein expression
during B cell lymphomagenesis

Rearrangements of MYC or ABL proto-oncogenes lead to deregulated expression of key-regulators of cell cycle and cell survival,
thereby constituting important drivers of blood cancer. Members of the BCL-2 family of apoptosis regulators contribute to
oncogenic transformation downstream of these oncogenes, but the role of anti-apoptotic BCL2A1/A1 in transformation and drug
resistance caused by deregulation of these oncogenes remains enigmatic. Here we analyzed the role of A1 in MYC as well as
ABL kinase-driven blood cancer in mice, employing in vivo RNAi. We report that overexpression of either oncogene leads to a
signiﬁcant increase in A1 protein levels in otherwise A1-negative B cell progenitors, indicating a key role downstream of these
oncogenes to secure survival during transformation. Knockdown of A1 by RNAi, however, did not impact on tumor latency in v-Abldriven pre-B-ALL. In contrast, A1 knockdown in premalignant Eμ-MYC mice caused a signiﬁcant reduction of transgenic pre-B cells
without impacting on tumor latency as the emerging lymphomas escaped silencing of A1 expression. These ﬁndings identify A1 as
a MYC target that can be induced prematurely during B cell development to aid expansion of otherwise cell-death-prone MYC
transgenic pre-B cells. Hence, A1 should be considered as a putative drug target in MYC-driven blood cancer.

INTRODUCTION
The role of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members as disease
promoters and mediators of drug resistance in human cancer is
well established. This prompted the development of BCL2
inhibitors, some of them well advanced in clinical trials, with
one of them recently approved for the treatment of refractory
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).1
Despite the large degree of redundancy of individual BCL-2
family proteins upon overexpression, cell type and trigger-speciﬁc
survival dependences have been noted. This led to the concept of
‘BCL-2-family addiction’ of human cancers, which means that
tumor cells depend regularly on one particular BCL-2 family
protein for cell survival, despite the fact that more such proteins
are found expressed in a given cancer cell type.2 Employing a
rapid screening method, referred to as ‘BH3-proﬁling’, the
dependence of a cancer cell on a subset of BCL-2 prosurvival
family members (BCL-2, BCL-X, BCL-W, MCL-1 or A1/BFL-1) can be
predicted with high reliability, facilitating choice of treatment.3
Recent studies in human cancer cells and cell lines, as well as
different animal models of blood cancer, including those for BCRABL-driven pre-B-ALL or MYC-driven B cell lymphomas, have
assigned critical survival roles to anti-apoptotic MCL-1 with
sometimes auxiliary roles for other survival factors, mainly BCL-X,
but quite often dispensable roles for BCL-2 itself.4,5
Although the key-role of MCL-1 or BCL-2 in tumor cell survival
and drug resistance is undisputed, little is known about the
relevance of related BCL2A1/A1 (called BFL-1 in humans), a poorly
investigated member of the BCL-2 family. A1 has been implicated
as tumor promoter or drug-resistance factor in different types of
lymphoid malignancies, including pre-B acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (pre-B-ALL), B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL),

mantle lymphoma (ML) or diffuse large-B cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
(reviewed in Ottina et al.6; Vogler et al.7 CLL and DLBCL patients
with high BFL1 mRNA expression levels show poor prognosis and
increased resistance to chemotherapeutics.8 More recent studies
further describe BFL-1 also as a resistance factor in BRAF-targeting
therapy in melanoma and BCL-2 inhibitor-treated CLL.9–11 A1/
BFL-1 is thus considered a putative therapeutic target in human
cancer, warranting its exploration in preclinical models.
Although rats and humans contain one gene encoding for A1/
BFL-1, mice contain four genes, three of them encoding for the
functional paralogues A1a, A1b and A1d. These three share more
than 95% homology at the protein as well as at the DNA level,
whereas A1c encodes a pseudogene.12 Because of this complex
genetic organization of the Bcl2a1 locus in mice, no functional
studies have been performed, leaving the role of A1 in preclinical
models of cancer unexplored. In normal tissues of adult mice, A1 is
expressed at low level in the hematopoietic system, in both
lymphoid and myeloid cells, but rapidly induced upon antigenreceptor stimulation in T and B cells or inﬂammatory cytokines as
well as lipopolysaccharide in myeloid cells and FcεRI ligation in
mast cells.13–15 Further evidence for a role of A1 in lymphocyte
survival originates from experiments where expression was
reduced by RNAi in vivo. Here B cells show increased spontaneous
and BCR-induced apoptosis in culture and, depending on the RNAi
system used, fail to accumulate in normal numbers.14,16 This
prompted us to test whether A1 is a putative therapeutic target in
B cell malignancies and whether B lymphoid tumors may be
addicted to A1 expression for survival. Therefore, we employed an
RNAi-based constitutive A1 knockdown mouse model to elicit its
effects on tumorigenesis induced by two common oncogenic
drivers of hematological disorders, c-MYC and ABL kinase. Our

ﬁndings provide evidence for a rate-limiting role of A1 in MYCdriven B cell lymphomagenesis.
RESULTS
Abelson kinase-driven oncogenic stress increases A1 protein
expression
Many members of the BCL-2 family are deregulated upon
oncogenic transformation in mouse or human cells. To test
whether A1 is also affected under such conditions, we analyzed
the impact of aberrant ABL-kinase signaling on A1 protein
expression. Similar to total bone marrow or early B cells in
mice,14 IL3-dependent BaF3 pro-B cells do express only low
amounts of A1 protein. However, upon transformation with the
p185 or the p210 variant of the BCR-ABL oncogene, protein
expression was strongly elevated (Figure 1a), a fact that correlated
well with their gained growth factor independence (not shown).
Together, this suggests that oncogenic ABL-kinase signaling
increases A1 protein levels, possibly to implement factorindependent cell survival, and that A1 may be a relevant player
for tumorigenesis or drug responsiveness in BCR-ABL+ pre-B-ALL.

v-Abl-driven pre-B-ALL is not limited by A1 knockdown
To investigate the relevance of A1 in ABL kinase-driven
malignancies, we took advantage of our recently established
mouse model. In these mice, all A1 paralogues expressed are
constitutively targeted by a single shRNA embedded in the miR30
backbone, placed in the 3′UTR of the ﬂuorescence marker Venus
and expressed under control of the hematopoiesis speciﬁc Vavgene promoter (VV-A1 mice).16 Depending on the organ, more
than 60% of all hematopoietic cells express the Venus reporter,
indicative of signiﬁcant, albeit mosaic, transgene expression
(Supplementary Figure S1a). Venus reporter expression was shown
by us to correlate well with A1 mRNA knockdown, ranging from
more than 80% in Venus+ thymocytes or bone marrow cells to
about 60% in the spleen.16 Of note, this mouse strain shows no
gross abnormalities in leukocyte subset composition, neither in
the Venus+ nor Venus-negative pool of cells, when compared with
wild-type (WT) or transgenic mice expressing a control shRNA
targeting Fireﬂy luciferase (VV-FF mice) (Supplementary
Figure S1b and Ottina et al.16
To address the role of A1 in leukemia development, we ﬁrst
performed colony-formation assays using primary bone marrow

from these animals that was transduced with p185BCR-ABL.17
No appreciable differences in colony formation were observed
between genotypes (data not shown). Next, we infected newborn
WT or VV-A1 mice with p160v-Abl encoding retrovirus and
monitored leukemia latency (Figure 1b). Infected mice of both
genotypes developed immature B cell precursor (pre-B) ALL with
similar penetrance, and latency and organ analysis by ﬂow
cytometry conﬁrmed comparable disease burden in bone marrow,
spleen and lymph nodes (Figures 1c and d; not shown).
Surprisingly, spleens from VV-A1 mice showed even higher
percentages of B220+CD43+ tumor cells when compared with
WT controls, whereas B220+CD43− B cells, representing more
mature cells, were actually lost (Figures 1c and d). It is hence
tempting to speculate that mature B cells suffer a survival
disadvantage upon A1 knockdown under conditions of stress,14
which may render them less competitive in a tumor-inﬁltrated
environment.
We next established v-Abl immortalized cell lines derived from
the bone marrow of diseased mice. These cell lines were tested for
their ability to respond to therapy. Cells were treated with imatinib
(Gleevec, Selleckchem, Munich, Germany), a clinically used BCRABL inhibitor that induces apoptosis depending on the BH3-only
protein and established A1 antagonist, BCL-2 interacting mediator
of cell death (BIM).18 In addition, we tested the response of these
tumor cells to the BH3-mimetic ABT-737 that inhibits BCL-2, BCL-X
and BCL-W but not MCL-1 or A1.19 Compared with immortalized
WT controls, cells derived from VV-A1 knockdown mice were
found more responsive to imatinib or imatinib plus ABT-737
(Figure 1e).
These data suggest that the ABL kinase-driven increase in
A1 expression is not essential for tumor development, indicating
functional redundancy with other survival proteins. Alternatively,
the knockdown efﬁcacy achieved in pre-B cells may not sufﬁce to
reveal a rate-limiting effect. Intriguingly, reduction of A1 expression sensitizes Abl-dependent tumor cells to imatinib, thereby
opening a potential therapeutic avenue to improve treatment
efﬁcacy of ABL-kinase inhibitors in BCR-ABL-driven disease.
MYC deregulation uncouples A1 expression from BCR signaling
To test if also the MYC oncogene inﬂuences A1 expression in
B cells, we analyzed A1 protein levels in BaF3 cells transduced with
a c-MYC encoding retrovirus or a control (Figure 2a). Along the
same line, we analyzed A1 expression in sorted bone marrow or
splenic B220+ sIgM+ and sIgM− B cells from WT or premalignant
Eμ-MYC or DT-A1 transgenic mice (Figure 2b). Here both BaF3
c-MYC cells and Eμ-MYC transgenic sIgM-negative B cells showed
substantially higher A1 levels than their respective controls
(Figures 2a and b). sIgM-negative B cells isolated form Eμ-MYC
transgenic spleens showed a similar increase in A1 expression
than those isolated from bone marrow. In addition, sIgM+ splenic
B cells, known to express basal levels of A1,14 increase A1 levels
further in the presence of oncogenic levels of MYC. Of note,
A1 expression was reduced by about half in Venus+ cells derived
from Eμ-MYC x VV-A1 double-transgenic (DT-A1) mice (Figure 2b).
The latter ﬁnding is in line with the previously reported degree of
A1 mRNA repression in Venus+ splenocytes of VV-A1 mice.16
Since we have shown that A1 levels in follicular B cells are
regulated by BCR signaling,14 we reasoned that A1 expression in
the context of MYC overexpression might become uncoupled
from these signals. To test this concept, we ﬁrst investigated
whether SYK inhibition is still capable to reduce A1 expression in
MYC transgenic B cells. Inhibition of SYK in WT cells that lack
exogenous MYC expression reduced A1 levels, but no effect on
A1 expression could be observed in MYC-transgenic IgM+ B cells
(Figure 2c). In line with our hypothesis, the treatment of sIgM+
MYC transgenic B cells with two different MYC inhibitors (G5 or F4)
led to an appreciable reduction of A1 protein expression

each. Membranes were reprobed for GAPDH to control for protein
loading. Figure displays one out of two independent experiments.

(Figure 2d), supporting the idea that A1 is placed under control
of c-MYC in this context.
MYC selects for sustained A1 expression during transformation
On the basis of these observations, we decided to study the role of
A1 in MYC-driven lymphomagenesis by intercrossing VV-A1 or
VV-FF mice, expressing a miR-shRNA-targeting ﬁreﬂy luciferase,
with Eμ-MYC transgenic mice. Eμ-MYC transgenic mice develop
aggressive pre-B sIgM− or sIgM+ B cell lymphomas within the ﬁrst
year of life.20 Eμ-MYC mice harboring A1 knockdown (referred to as
DT-A1 mice) did not show differences in disease-free survival when
compared with single transgenic Eμ-MYC or Eμ-MYC mice expressing the control miR-shRNA (DT-FF mice). Accordingly, disease
burden, as assessed by white blood cell counts, and splenic weight
were comparable across genotypes (Figures 3a and b).
Loss of essential survival factors, such as Mcl-1, often selects for
tumors that have escaped Cre-mediated deletion.21,22 We thus
compared transgene expression, as indicated by the Venus

us to conclude that high MYC expression selects against miRshRNA expression in DT-A1 mice in an attempt to sustain
A1 levels.

reporter, in 4–6-weeks-old premalignant mice with reporter
expression in diseased mice (Figure 3c). Flow cytometric analysis
revealed that the percentage of Venus-expressing cells was
signiﬁcantly reduced in bone marrow, blood, lymph node and
spleen of leukemic DT-A1 mice, suggesting possible counterselection of cells expressing the miR-shRNA targeting A1.
Importantly, we failed to detect reduced Venus expression in
diseased DT-FF double transgenic mice (Figure 3c). These data led

MYC-transgenic B cells with reduced A1 levels are more
susceptible to apoptosis
To test whether the loss of Venus expression, as noted in leukemic
mice, was indeed due to loss of transgene expression in B cells, we
performed more detailed ﬂow cytometric analyses on isolated
tumors. Consistent with our hypothesis of counter-selection, the
majority of B220+ B cells were found to be Venus-negative in
DT-A1 mice, whereas DT-FF tumors remained Venus+ in blood,
spleen, bone marrow or lymph nodes of moribund mice
(Figure 4a; Supplementary Figure S2).
To dissect at which stage of B cell development cells expressing
the miR-shRNA targeting A1 were counter-selected, early during
development or upon transformation, we analyzed the Venus
expression levels in premalignant mice at 5–6 weeks of age. Flow
cytometric analysis revealed that Venus-positive pre-B cells were
already signiﬁcantly underrepresented in bone marrow, spleen,
blood or lymph nodes of premalignant mice. This phenomenon
was accompanied by the proportional increase in T and myeloid
cells (Figure 4b; Supplementary Figure S2).
This suggested that the reduction of A1 expression in DT-A1
mice affects survival of premalignant B cells. Therefore, splenocytes from Eμ-MYC, DT-FF and DT-A1 were put in culture, either left
untreated or stimulated with mitogens known to induce A1
expression. After 24 h, we analyzed the percentage of viable
B cells compared with that detected straight after isolation. In line
with a role for A1 in B cell survival in the context of MYC
overexpression, we observed a strong reduction in the percentage
of viable B cells in DT-A1 splenocyte cultures, in relation to Venusexpression, when compared with Eμ-MYC or DT-FF controls.
Signiﬁcant differences were observed in untreated cultures but
also upon stimulation with IL2/4/5, lipopolysaccharide or antiCD40. Although all these treatments increased B cell survival
ex vivo to a certain degree when compared with untreated
controls, IgM stimulation selectively improved the survival of MYCtransgenic B cells expressing the shRNA targeting A1 (DT-A1+)
(Figures 5a and b). As this effect was not noted in Venus-negative
cells or cells derived from the other genotypes, we speculate that
the IgM-driven increase in A1 mRNA transcription and protein
expression may exceed the capacity of the A1 knockdown system,
thereby facilitating the survival of these cells. We conclude that
tight control of A1 expression is needed to prevent cell death
upon oncogenic stress caused by deregulation of c-MYC in
premalignant B cells.
BFL-1 transgene expression rescues B cell loss in DT-A1 mice
Despite the use of DT-FF mice as a model system controlling for
generic side effects caused by miR-shRNA overexpression, it
remained possible that the increased cell death susceptibility and
underrepresentation of Venus+ MYC-transgenic B cells noted in
DT-A1 mice might be due to a miR-shRNA-driven off-target effect
rather than a reduction in A1 expression. To exclude this
possibility, we intercrossed DT-A1 mice with animals overexpressing human BFL-1 as a transgene under control of the Vav-gene
promoter (Supplementary Figure S3a). Although Vav-BFL-1 transgenic mice did not show a substantial overexpression of BFL-1
protein in the bone marrow when compared with lymph node,
thymus or spleen, nor an increase in pro/pre-B cells
(Supplementary Figure S3a; Tuzlak et al., manuscript in preparation), transgene expression clearly prevented the loss of sIgMnegative B cells in triple transgenic (TT-A1) mice (Supplementary
Figure S3b). In fact, sIgM-negative B cells became the dominant
B cell type in all lymphatic organs in these animals (Figures 6a and b).
This observation suggested that even low-level BFL-1 overexpression

compensates for the shRNA-mediated knockdown of A1 in the
presence of oncogenic MYC, a notion further supported by the
strongly increased survival of TT-A1-derived B cells cultured ex vivo
(Supplementary Figure 3b).
DISCUSSION
Using a constitutively active model of in vivo RNAi that allows
simultaneous targeting of all A1 paralogues expressed in mice
leading to ~ 50% reduction in protein expression, thereby
circumventing possible adaptation processes associated with
complete loss of gene function, we deﬁne anti-apoptotic Bcl2a1/
A1 as a MYC target and facilitator of B cell transformation.
In contrast, A1 appears dispensable for BCR-ABL or v-Abl-driven
transformation and pre-B-ALL development, although aberrant
kinase signaling, similar to MYC overexpression, led to an increase
in A1 protein expression. On the basis of this, one may
hypothesize that deregulation of ABL kinase that activates
multiple signaling pathways enhancing proliferation and cell
Oncogene (2017) 2066 – 2073

survival, including JAK/STAT and PI3K signaling next to MYC
activation,17,23 can engage multiple Bcl-2 prosurvival proteins, and
that among those A1 exerts only a redundant role. Interestingly,
however, the combined inhibition of the v-Abl kinase by imatinib
and that of Bcl-2 proteins not under direct control of kinase
signaling using ABT-737 enhances cell death in A1 knockdown
cells. This assigns an unnoted survival role to A1 in Abltransformed early B cell progenitors that is independent of kinase
signaling and that may hence be exploited therapeutically by
combinatorial drug targeting.
Our data are also in line with the ﬁnding that survival of provs pre-B cells is differentially regulated during lymphocyte
development where these cells seem to rely on Mcl-1 and Bcl-x,
respectively (reviewed in Sochalska et al.24). Evidently, these
dependencies seem to change in response to oncogenic stress
and may assign cell type dependent roles to A1 or other BCL-2
prosurvival homologues that cannot be anticipated from their
expression pattern observed during normal hematopoiesis. This
phenomenon is best exempliﬁed by the fact that high levels of BCL-2

or BCL-X have been reported to be selected for in MYC-driven
lymphomas,25 but deletion of Bcl-2 had no impact on tumorigenesis,
while loss of Bcl-x caused only a moderate delay in tumor latency.4,5
In contrast, deletion of Mcl-1 that was never reported as overexpressed in murine MYC-driven B cell tumors effectively precluded
tumor formation and was actively selected against in mice that
eventually developed disease.22 Similar ﬁndings were made in BCRABL-driven pre-B-ALL where loss of Bcl-x had no effect on
tumorigenesis, whereas loss of Mcl-1 prevented disease.22 Together,
this suggests that MCL-1 is the key prosurvival BCL-2 protein for
immature pro- and pre-B cells during oncogenic transformation and
that one or the other BCL-2 family member may have auxiliary
function, depending on cell type, differentiation stage or oncogenic
driver. This is best seen for Bcl-x in the context of MYC overexpression. Based on our ﬁndings, A1 also appears to qualify as
auxiliary factor in MYC-driven transformation. This notion is also
underlined by the fact that the protumorigenic potential of
exogenous A1 has been demonstrated before in MYC-driven B cell
and Lck-driven T cell transformation.26,27
Deregulation of BCL-2 family member expression is well known
to associate with tumor progression and drug resistance in blood
cancer and oncogenic kinases such as BCR-ABL. BCL-2 family
members appear to repress apoptosis in part by inhibiting the
effects of proapoptotic BH3-only proteins, such as BIM or
BCL-2-associated death promoter.18 Based on our observation
that v-Abl-transgenic tumor cells expressing the miR-shRNA
targeting A1 were found more sensitive to imatinib, we conclude
that v-Abl-kinase signaling promotes survival at least in part by
increasing the ratio between A1 and BIM expression levels.
Reducing this ratio can facilitate BIM-dependent cell death, as
documented before in mature B cells exposed to SYK inhibitor
that blocks BCR-dependent A1 expression.14 Along these lines,
recent evidence uncovered that high expression of A1/BFL-1
mediates drug resistance to BRAF inhibitors that have also been
shown to act in part by stabilizing BIM levels in human
melanoma.11 Hence, the ratio between A1 and BIM may be
decisive how well malignant cells can respond to therapy.
Similarly, MYC overexpression uncouples A1 expression from
BCR signaling. Lowering A1 levels increased cell death of MYCtransgenic B cells that can be counteracted by IgM stimulation,
shown to induce A1 protein (Figure 2), or by re-expression of RNAi
resistant BFL1 (Figure 6). Similar to Bim that has been identiﬁed as
a bona ﬁde MYC target28 and the BCL2A1 promoter has been
conﬁrmed to among a large set of MYC binding loci mapped in
human B cells.29 We thus hypothesize that co-regulation of A1 by
MYC helps to antagonize the proapoptotic potential of BIM in the
context of deregulated MYC expression, thereby facilitating
transformation. As such, A1 may also be a limiting factor
antagonizing cell death induced by extensive BCR cross-linking
that appears to engage different BH3-only proteins, including BIM,
in established Eμ-MYC-tumors.30 Most strikingly, this study shows
also that resistance to apoptosis caused by loss of Bim can
be ameliorated by inhibition of SYK that acts in part by reducing
A1 expression.14
In light of the ﬁnding that the application of BH3-mimetics
induces compensatory A1 overexpression in human CLL and NHLmodel cell lines, further studies into the role of A1/BFL-1 as a
survival and drug-resistance factor in human blood cancer are
warranted. Of note, BFL1 is induced by epstein–barr virus infection
in an LMP1-dependent manner, a situation frequently found in
Burkitt lymphoma patients.31 It is currently unclear, however,
whether A1 is needed for tumor maintenance. It is safe to predict
that the selective inhibition of A1 has the potential to enhance
effects/synergize with state-of-the-art anticancer therapy even
when not active as single agent in the A1/BFL-1-dependent cancer
cell type.

MYC engages BCL2A1/A1 for lymphomagenesis
M Sochalska et al

2072

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Transgenic mice
Animal experiments were performed in accordance with Austrian
legislation (BMWF: 66-011/0006-II/3b/2014). The generation and genotyping of VV-A1, VV-FF and Eμ-MYC mice have been described.16,20 Vav-BFL1
mice were generated by pronucleus injection using the VavP vector32
encoding BFL-1 cDNA. The generation of these mice will be described in
detail elsewhere. All mice were maintained on a C57BL/6 genetic
background. Disease assessment: signs of leukemia/lymphoma were
monitored for by regular palpation three times a week, monitoring of
body weight, short breath and/or scruffy fur as well as social behavior.
Inclusion criteria for sacriﬁce: detection of enlarged lymph nodes or spleen
by palpation, weight loss of 415% and short breath.

Cell culture, virus production and reagents
All cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere containing 5%
CO2. v-Abl transduced pre-B cell lines and BaF3 cells (ATCC, Wesel,
Germany) were grown in the RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich,
Dorset, UK) supplemented with 10% FCS (Sigma-Aldrich, F7524), 250 μM
L-glutamine (PAA laboratories, Pasching, Austria, M11-004), 100 U/ml
penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (PAA laboratories, P11-010) and
50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol (Applicam, Darmstadt, Germany). Cell lines
tested negative for mycoplasma contamination by PCR (Lonza, Basel,
Switzerland). Primary hematopoietic cells were cultured in RPMI-1640
medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 250 μM L-glutamine, 50 μM
2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco, Waltham, MA, USA),
100 μM nonessential amino acids (Gibco) and antibiotics. To generate viral
supernatants encoding for v-Abl, A010 cells were plated in 100 mm dishes,
precoated with gelatine (1% in PBS) and grown to conﬂuency. Supernatant
was harvested every 8 h for 40 h, pooled and ﬁltered through a 0.45 m
ﬁlter prior to injection. For the induction of pre-B-ALL, newborn mice
were injected subcutaneously with 100 μl of v-Abl-endcoding retroviral
supernatant as described.17

Antibodies, ﬂow cytometric analysis and cell sorting
The monoclonal antibodies used were purchased from eBioscience (San
Diego, CA, USA) BioLegend (London, UK) or BD (San Diego, CA, USA). Flow
cytometric analysis or cell sorting was performed on an LSR-Fortessa or a
FACS-Aria-III, respectively (both BD). Antibodies used for ﬂow cytometry:
T-cells: 53-6.7, anti-CD8 (25-0081-82, eBioscience); RM 4-5, anti-CD4 (45-004282, eBioscience); 3C7, anti-CD25 (12-0251-83, eBioscience); B-cells: RA3-6B2,
anti-B220 (103224, Biolegend); 1B11, anti-CD43 (121204, Biolegend); 2B8,
anti–c-Kit (105813, Biolegend); II/41, anti-IgM (406509, Biolegend); 11/26C,
anti-IgD (12-5993-83, eBioscience); 6D5, anti-CD19 (115533, Biolegend);
myeloid cells: RB6-8C5, anti–Gr-1 (108404, Biolegend); S7, MI/70, anti–Mac-1
(17-0112-83, eBioscience). Biotinylated antibodies were detected using
streptavidin-RPE (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) or streptavidin coupled to
PE-Cy7, APC, APC-Cy7 or PerCP5.5 (BioLegend or eBioscience).

recognizing B220 or IgM, and analyzed further based on Venusreporter expression (IgM− cells representing pro/pre-B cells and
IgM+ cells representing immature/mature B cells). The percentage of
cells falling within each gate is shown. Data shown in (a) are
quantiﬁed in (b). Bars represent means ± s.e.m. (MYC n = 8, DT-A1
n = 13, TT-A1 n = 4 biological replicates, six independent experiments). ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc test. *P ⩽ 0.05,
**P ⩽ 0.01, ***P ⩽ 0.001. LN = lymph nodes, BM = bone marrow.
NS = not signiﬁcant.

Oncogene (2017) 2066 – 2073

Cell lysates were prepared in CHAPS-containing lysis buffer and analyzed
by immunoblotting as described.16 For detection of proteins by
chemoluminescence (Advansta, Menlo Park, CA, USA, K-12049-D50) a
rat anti-mA1 mAb, clone 6D6-1-1,33 rat anti-Bim, clone 3C5 (Enzo,
Lausen, Switzerland), rabbit anti-Mcl1 (Rockland, Hamburg, Germany,
600-401-394) and a rabbit anti-GAPDH mAb (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA,
USA, 2118, 1:5000) were used. An anti-BFL-1 polyclonal rabbit serum
was kindly provided by J Borst (NKI). Goat anti-rabbit Ig/HRP (Dako,
P0448) or rabbit anti rat-IgG heavy chain-HRP (Cell Signaling, 7077) were
used as secondary reagents.

Survival assays and chemical compounds
Splenocytes were stimulated for 24 h with 100 U/ml of mIL-2, 10 ng/ml
mIL-4, 10 ng/ml mIL-5 (all PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) and 1 μg/ml goat
anti-mouse IgM F(ab′)2 fragments (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany), 1 μg/ml
hamster anti-mouse CD40 mAb (BioLegend or BD) or 20 μg/ml or
lipopolysaccharide (Sigma-Aldrich, L2880). Prior ﬂow cytometric analysis,
cells were stained with B220-PE and CD19-APC antibodies. The percentage
of viable cells was determined using Annexin-V-Paciﬁc Blue (eBioscience,
88-8006-74). Five cell lines derived from WT and ﬁve cell lines derived from
diseased VV-A1 mice infected with v-Abl oncogene were treated with
Imatinib (Selleckchem) or ABT-737 (Selleckchem), alone or in combination.
SYK inhibitor R406 was purchased from Selleckchem. The MYC-selective

inhibitors, 10058-F4 and 10074-G5, were kindly provided by Dr Markus
Hartl, LFU Innsbruck.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA followed by Bonferoni post hoc
test, applying the PRISM Graphpad software. P values o0.05 were considered
to indicate statistically signiﬁcant differences. For statistical analysis, mean
values with s.e.m. are presented in graphs that were derived from several
independent repeats of experiments. Bartlett’s test for equal variances did not
reveal any variances that were signiﬁcantly different. Normal distribution was
assessed (for data sets n X 5) by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. For survival
analysis of tumor mice, the log rank (Mantel–Cox) test was used.
