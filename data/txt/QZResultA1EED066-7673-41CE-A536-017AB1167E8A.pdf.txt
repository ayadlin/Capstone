PURPOSE: Biomarkers that predict response or toxicity to antiangiogenic therapy are sought to favorably inform the
risk/benefit ratio. This study evaluated the association of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) genetic polymorphisms with the development of hypertension (HTN) and clinical outcome in metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (MCCRCC) patients treated with sunitinib. PATIENT AND METHODS: Sixty-three
MCCRCC patients receiving sunitinib (50 mg 4/2) with available blood pressure (BP) data and germline DNA were
retrospectively identified. A panel of candidate VEGF and VEGFR2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were
evaluated for associations with the development of hypertension and clinical outcome. RESULTS: VEGF SNP 634
genotype was associated with the prevalence and duration of sunitinib-induced hypertension (as defined by systolic
pressure 150 mmHg and/or diastolic pressure 90 mmHg) in both univariable analysis (P ¼ .03 and .01, respectively) and multivariable analysis, which adjusted for baseline BP and use of antihypertension medication (P ¼ .05
and .02, respectively). Patients with the GG genotype were estimated to have a greater likelihood of being hypertensive during treatment compared with patients with the CC genotype (odds ratio of 13.62, 95% confidence interval
[CI] 3.71-50.04). No single VEGF or VEGFR SNPs were found to correlate with clinical outcome. However, the combination of VEGF SNP 936 and VEGFR2 SNP 889 were associated with overall survival after adjustment for prognostic
risk group (P ¼ .03). CONCLUSIONS: In MCCRCC patients treated with sunitinib, VEGF SNP 634 is associated with
hypertension and a combination of VEGF SNP 936 and VEGFR2 SNP 889 genotypes is associated with overall

INTRODUCTION
Because angiogenesis is central to tumor growth, strategies for inhibiting this pathway have been a focus for drug
development.1 Early success to potentially blunt vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling was realized with
bevacizumab currently approved for use in the treatment of breast, colorectal, lung, brain, and kidney cancer.1 Complexity
of the VEGF pathway has led to the development of VEGF receptor (VEGFR) targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
that have rapidly entered the clinical arena because of their efficacy in treating cancers, particularly renal cancer.2 The
efficacy of these TKIs in inhibiting several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in the angiogenesis signaling pathway may be
responsible for both their efficacy and associated toxicity.3-5

VEGF and VEGFR2 SNPs in Sunitinib Therapy/Kim et al

In the clinical setting there is a wide heterogeneity in
therapeutic efficacy and degree of toxicity experienced by
patients treated with the TKIs, and thus far, predictors of
clinical response and/or toxicity that would aid in maximizing therapeutic index remain largely unknown. In
exploring individual susceptibility, genetic variations,
specifically single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that
reside within both coding and noncoding regions within
VEGF and VEGFR2, have shown promising potential as
biomarkers for clinical response or toxicity with VEGF
pathway targeted therapy.6-9
Hypertension (HTN) caused by the TKIs has been
shown to be dependent on the potency of these inhibitors
against VEGFR2,3 and data suggest that host susceptibility, such as preexisting HTN, can also affect the induction
of HTN during treatment with these agents. Correlation
between HTN and inhibitory effects on VEGFR2 is
strengthened by the recent finding that treatment with a
specific VEGFR2 antibody in vivo leads to a sustained
and rapid increase in blood pressure (BP).10 Based on this
observation it was inferred that VEGF, acting through
VEGFR2, can play a critical role in BP control by promoting nitric oxide synthase expression and nitric oxide
activity.10
Thus, given the central role of VEGF and VEGFR2
in angiogenesis as a mechanism for development of HTN,
it was hypothesized that SNPs within VEGF and
VEGFR2 may provide the genetic basis for the variability
in response and HTN seen in patients treated with VEGF
pathway inhibitor therapy. This study involved analysis of
a panel of 6 VEGF and 2 VEGFR2 SNPs in germline
DNA in mRCC patients during sunitinib therapy and
their correlation to HTN as well as clinical outcome, in
particular, progression free survival (PFS) and overall
survival.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Patients with metastatic clear cell carcinoma treated with
sunitinib (50 mg daily on a 4 weeks on/2 weeks off schedule) from 8/2004 to 9/2008 with available BP data
obtained in clinic were retrospectively identified. Computed tomography (CT) scans were obtained at baseline
and on average after every 2 cycles (12 weeks) of therapy
according to treating physician discretion. Dose modifications for toxicity were according to treating physician
decision. Objective response was recorded per investigator
assessment according to the RECIST criteria, version

period.
DNA Extraction from Blood and
Tumor Tissues
Genomic DNA from peripheral blood or frozen tissue
was isolated using the Puregene Blood DNA Isolation kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, Calif) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. For DNA extraction from paraffin embedded
tissue 5-lM-thick sections from microdiossected tumor
was prepared as previously described.12
SNP Analysis
A panel of candidate VEGF and VEGFR2 SNPs that has
demonstrated an association between VEGF/VEGFR
genotype and HTN or overall survival among breast
cancer patients treated with the anti-VEGF agent, bevacizumab, has been reported by Schneider et al.9 Based on
the clinical activity of sunitinib in the management of
metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (MCCRCC),
and the documented effects of sunitinib on the VEGF/
VEGFR2 signaling pathway, we sought to investigate a
possible association between an expanded panel of
VEGF/VEGFR SNPs and toxicity and outcome with
sunitinib treatment. An overview of the panel of VEGF
and VEGFR2 SNPs analyzed in this study with a description of location, reference sequence (rs)-numbers and
forward and reverse primers used for polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) amplification is outlined in Table 1.
PCR-based amplification of the sequences flanking each
SNP was performed on samples of genomic DNA derived
from peripheral blood samples and available tumor
samples. Sequencing results were confirmed by reamplification and resequencing of DNA in the reverse direction.
The PCR mix contained, 100 ng genomic DNA, 1.5 mM
MgCl2, 0.625 mM dNTPs, and 1 PCR buffer (20 mM
TrisHCl, pH 8.4, 50 mM KCl), 0.75 U Taq polymerase,
and 0.5 pmol of the forward and reverse primers in a total
of 15 lL. All PCR reactions, before submission to the
core sequencing facility, were run on a 6% nondenaturing
polyacrylamide gel to check for amplification of a single
product at the appropriate size with the aid of a marker
ladder (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, Mass). Negative
no DNA template controls did not amplify. The amplicons were sequenced using an ABI377 automated
sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif) at the
Cleveland Clinic Foundation’s Genomic Core at the

Lerner Research Institute using either the forward or
reverse PCR primer. There were several types of positive
controls. These included simply repeating the PCR and
sequencing and obtaining the same genotype, or using
identical samples that had been previously successfully
amplified for other SNPs not reported in this study, or in
the case of SNP 889 VEGFR, using different primer sets
to amplify the same 889 SNP and getting the same genotype. Sequences derived from the amplified samples were
compared with the respective wild-type VEGF or
VEGFR2 using LaserGene software (DNAStar, PerkinElmer, Foster City, Calif) to identify and characterize the
polymorphisms.

Analysis of VEGF and VEGFR-2 Haplotype
Unphased SNP genotypes were assembled into phased
haplotypes and SNPs missing directly observed genotypes
were assigned ‘‘most likely’’ genotypes using Phase
v2.1.1.14,15 Haploview v4.1 software was used to calculate
linkage disequilibrium (LD) relationships between the
SNPs and to analyze haplotype blocks.16

Definition of HTN
HTN was defined before data review as systolic blood
pressure (SBP) 150 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 90 mmHg. These cutoff values were chosen
based on the following criteria: 1) NCI CTCAE version
3.0 designation of SBP > 150 mmHg as grade I HTN,
and 2) improved outcome in metastatic renal cell cancer
(RCC) patients with axitinib-related DBP 90 mm Hg
as demonstrated in a prior analysis.13 Blood pressure (BP)
measurements used were obtained upon patient arrival to
an outpatient clinic at baseline and generally on day 28 of
each sunitinib cycle. Home BP assessments were not used
in the present data analysis.
For this study, 2 HTN variables were analyzed.
First, prevalence of HTN on sunitinib therapy was evaluated. Prevalence was defined as a binary indicator of
whether or not patients in each VEGF SNP genotype
cohort exhibited SBP 150 and/or DBP 90 at anytime

Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoints of this investigation were 2 measures of HTN (prevalence and duration, as described
above), PFS, and overall survival. PFS was measured from
the date sunitinib therapy started to the date of documented progression or death, whichever came first. Overall survival was measured from the start of treatment to
death or last follow-up. The panel of SNPs was summarized by the frequency of each genotype and all SNPs were
considered in all analyses. However, as the VEGF SNPs
2578 and 2459 were found to be in complete LD (r2
¼ 1 with the 2578A allele in cis with the 2459 18-nt
insertion allele), VEGF 2459 was not analyzed independently. Directly observed genotypes obtained from
the SNP analysis described above were used for data analysis for most patients. However, in 37% of patients, genotypes could not be determined for 1 or more SNPs
(primarily VEGF SNP 1154). In those cases best

predicted genotypes derived from the PHASE program
were used in the analysis.
The relationship between individual SNPs and the
prevalence of HTN was analyzed in univariable analysis
using the Cochran-Armitage trend test and Fisher exact
test. Linear regression models and proportional hazards
models were used to assess their association with the duration of HTN and PFS and overall survival, respectively.
The joint effect of multiple SNPs was assessed using logistic (HTN prevalence), linear (HTN duration), and proportional hazards (PFS and overall survival) models. In all
cases the models addressing HTN included terms for
baseline SBP and DBP and the use of antihypersentive
medications; and the models addressing clinical outcome
included a term for risk group status based on the Cleveland Clinic TKI classification system.17 A backward selection algorithm that initially included all SNPs and used
P ¼ .10 as the criteria for retention in the model was used
to identify which, if any, SNPs or SNP combinations
were independent prognostic factors for the outcome
being analyzed. No adjustments were made for P values
for multiple comparisons, and all data analyses were conducted using SAS version 8 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
A total of 63 patients were identified. Patient characteristics
are listed in Table 2. This was a typical metastatic renal cell
carcinoma (RCC) population of predominantly male
patients with a median age of 60 years. All patients had clear
cell histology RCC, with 89% of patients having undergone
prior nephrectomy and 63% of patients having had prior
therapy with either cytokines and/or VEGFR TKIs. 86% of
patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Sixty-two percent of
patients progressed at a median of 20.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 16.3-33.9) and 38% (24/63) have died.
Median overall survival has not been reached; however, the
estimated 1- and 2-year survival rates were 84%  5% and
70%  6%, respectively.
Baseline BP characteristics of 63 patients in the
study are summarized in Table 2. Median SBPs and
DBPs at baseline were 139 mm (range, 93-190 mm) and
80 mm (range, 47-103 mm), respectively; 38% of patients
had SBP >150 mm and/or DBP >90 mm. A total of
57% of patients (36 of 63) were being treated with
median of 1 (range, 0-4) antihypertensive medications at
baseline.

and both VEGF SNPs 634 and 1498 in univariable
analysis; with patients having the more favorable genotypes (634 CC and 1498 TT) having less HTN, P ¼
.03 in both cases. In addition, no association was seen
between the prevalence of HTN and VEGF SNPs
1154 or 936. In contrast to E2100, however, SNP
2578 was also seen to be significantly associated with
HTN; all 11 patients with an AA genotype having HTN
compared with 89% (34 of 63) of those with an AC genotype, and 71% (10 of 14) of patients with a CC genotype, P ¼ .03. Neither of the VEGFR2 SNPs analyzed
was associated with the prevalence of HTN.

In addition to being associated with the prevalence
of HTN, VEGF SNP 634, was also associated with
HTN duration in univariable analysis. Patients with the
CC genotype were hypertensive for a median of 8.9% of
the treatment period compared with 10.2% for patients

models were assessed. As described in the methods, all 7
SNPs summarized in Table 3 were initially included in the
models, as were terms for pretreatment SBP and DBP and
concurrent antihypertensive therapy. For the prevalence of
HTN after dropping SNPs unrelated to this outcome,
VEGF 634 was the only SNP found to have independent
prognostic value (P ¼ .05). Adjusting for pretreatment
SBP and DBP, and antihypertensive use, patients with the
less favorable GG genotype were estimated to have an
approximately 13- to 14-fold greater likelihood of being
hypertensive during treatment compared with patients with
the more favorable CC genotype (odds ratio of 13.62; 95%
CI, 3.71-50.04), whereas patients with a CG genotype
were estimated to have a 3-4-fold greater likelihood (odds
ratio, 3.69; 95% CI, 1.01-13.51). VEGF 634 remained
significantly associated with the prevalence of HTN after
restriction to the subset of patients who were neither hypertensive at baseline nor on antihypertensive medications pretreatment (n ¼ 24, P ¼ .05). Small subsets precluded
analysis by use or type of antihypertensive medication initiated during sunitinib therapy.
In a similarly conducted analysis VEGF SNP 634
was also the only SNP found to be an independent predictor of the duration of HTN (P ¼ .02). Adjusting for the
effects of antihypertensive therapy and pretreatment SBP
and DBP patients with the GG genotype were estimated to
be hypertensive 21% longer on average than patients with
the CC genotype (95% CI, 12%-29%). A similar trend

Cancer

was seen in the subset of patients who at pretreatment were
normotensive and not taking antihypertensive medications,
although the effect was not statistically significant.
Adjusting for the effects of prognostic risk group,17
none of the SNPs examined either alone or in combination was associated with PFS. However, there was some
suggestion that VEGF SNP 936 (P ¼ .16) and/or
VEGFR SNP 889 (P ¼ .08) may be associated with overall survival; patients with 936 CC and 889 GG genotypes
having a poorer prognosis. In multivariable analysis,
which was conducted in a manner similar to the analyses
of HTN, the joint effect of these 2 SNPs was seen to be an
independent predictor of overall survival P ¼ .03), even
after adjusting for the impact of CCF-TKI risk group (P
¼ .001). That is, patients who were CC for 936 and GG
for 889 were estimated to have an approximately 3-fold
greater risk of death than patients with other genotypes
(hazard ratio of 3.18; 95% CI, 1.12-8.99) (Fig. 2). This is
in contrast to E2100, which found an association between
overall survival and VEGF SNPs 2578 and 1154.
VEGF Haplotype Analysis
Linkage disequilibrium plots from analysis of VEGF
SNPs in genomic DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes, paired tumor from patients with lymphocyte DNA
and RCC cell lines (13 with clear cell and 1 with papillary
histologies) are given in Figure 3. Strong evidence of LD
is apparent in lymphocytic DNA, tumor DNA and renal
carcinoma cell lines. In addition, independent analysis of
the various VEGF SNPs in DNA from lymphocytes, tumor, or cell lines revealed an identical predominant haplotype with comparable frequency. It is also important to
note that SNPs 2578, 2549, 1498, and 634, 3 of
which were the SNPs most strongly associated with HTN
in univariable analysis, demonstrated strong evidence for
linkage disequilibrium; and is the likely reason 2578
and 1498 were not found to be independent prognostic
factors in the multivariable analysis.

DISCUSSION
This is the first report identifying VEGF and VEGFR2
SNPs associated with HTN or outcome in MCCRCC
patients treated with sunitinib. A key finding is the role of
VEGF SNP 634 with treatment-induced HTN as
observed here with sunitinib therapy and by Schneider et
al9 in breast cancer patients treated with bevacizumab.
The present analysis suggests VEGF SNP 634 that is
potentially involved in translational efficiency of VEGF18
is an independent predictor of the prevalence and

duration of HTN during sunitinib therapy for RCC
patients. Further, analysis of 634 (and other SNPs)
from tumor-derived DNA showed near 100% concordance with germline DNA genotypes, suggesting that the
VEGF genotypes from tumor would correlate similarly to
both occurrence and duration of HTN during sunitinib
therapy in this patient cohort. VEGF SNP 1498, which
was significantly associated with HTN in E2100,9 was also
associated with HTN in the present study, but only in univariable analysis. This lack of independent prognostic value
may be due to several reasons including the strong linkage
disequilibrium with 634 seen with genomic DNA analyzed from lymphocytes, renal tumor, and RCC lines, inherent difference in the downstream effect of VEGF and
VEGFR inhibition in targeting angiogenesis in different tumor types, effects of small sample size and the retrospective
nature of this study with variable timing of BP attainment
and management of sunitinib-induced HTN. VEGF SNP
2578, which was not associated with HTN in E2100, was
similarly prognostic in the present study in univariable but
not multivariable analysis, possibly for the same reasons as
described above.
Interestingly, for VEGF SNP 634, a higher proportion of patients (57.1%) with RCC in the current study
were G/G compared with 42.4% in patients with nonsmallcell lung cancer19 and 44.6% in a control population.19 The
etiology for this discrepancy is unclear. However, 1 hypoth-

1952

esis that may be derived from previous studies is the possible
correlation between VEGF polymorphism and the development and extent of RCC. Kawai et al,20 for example,
reported in a patient population of Japanese origin with
RCC that, although the 634 polymorphism was not
found to have a clinical effect, VEGF SNPs 2578 and
1154 were associated with metastases, pathologic tumor
stage, and survival. More recently Bruyere et al21 reported
that 460 VEGF polymorphism was a risk factor for renal
cancer in Caucasian subjects. It is difficult to reconcile these
results with the present study, however, because their focus
was on risk/prognosis for renal cancer and not treatmentrelated toxicity or outcome. Further, the small sample size of
the present cohort makes the estimation of genotype frequency imprecise.
Analysis of VEGF SNP genotypes obtained from
available tumor tissue (30 patients with paired lymphocyte
DNA) highly correlated (>98%) with those derived from
the peripheral blood. This is in agreement with prior studies demonstrating that variability seen in common polymorphic sites is usually inherited,9 suggesting that DNA
from either peripheral blood or tumor is useful for analysis
of VEGF SNPs associated with response or toxicity to sunitinib therapy in mRCC. The present study did not measure
circulating VEGF levels, but the 634 polymorphism has
been reported to affect VEGF production18 and carriers of
the 2578C, 460T, and 405 C alleles were found to have
significantly higher serum VEGF levels in patients with
ovarian cancer.22
Although individually no single VEGF or VEGFR2
SNPs was associated with overall survival, it was of interest
that VEGF 936 and VEGFR2 889 combined did have an
impact. Because VEGFR2 SNP 889 is located in the
VEGF binding domain, the polymorphism may have a
differential effect on VEGF ligand binding and its downstream signaling through VEGFR2. The lack of association with PFS implies that either this genotype is
prognostic in RCC and independent of treatment effect,
or that the cohort size lacked adequate power to detect a
treatment effect. As with several of the hypotheses generated from these data, further prospective testing in a larger
cohort, preferably with a control group, either untreated
or treated with alternative agents, is required. Although
this study did not find any association of VEGFR2 SNP
889 with HTN, van Erp et al23 reported that the T allele
was associated with increased risk for development of any
toxicity greater than grade 2. Interestingly, the unfavorable VEGF 936 CC genotype and VEGFR2 889 GG genotype was found in >65% and 78%, respectively, of the

VEGF and VEGFR2 SNPs in Sunitinib Therapy/Kim et al

Figure 3. This figure shows haploview linkage disequlibrium (LD) plots of SNPs and haplotype with frequency in genomic DNA
from peripheral blood, paired renal carcinoma obtained at nephrectomy and renal cancer cell lines cultured in vitro. The r2 value
is the square of the correlation coefficient between two loci: r2 ¼ 0, white; 0 < r2 < 1, shades of gray; r2 ¼ 1, black.

RCC cell lines analyzed in this study. Because the effect of
sunitinib in inducing HTN is possibly related to inhibition
of VEGFR2, and antibodies to VEGFR2 can induce
HTN,10 inhibitory effects of sunitinib on VEGFR2 and
circulating VEGF levels affected by VEGF SNP 634 and
93618,24 may be important determinants of treatmentinduced HTN and/or outcome. This hypothesis requires
prospective testing in a larger cohort of patients.
Although results from this study provide evidence
on VEGF and VEGFR2 SNPs as potential biomarkers of
toxicity and outcome in MCCRCC patients treated with
sunitinib, limitations include the retrospective nature of
the present study, limited number of patients, and variability in timing of BP as well as tumor measurements
between patients. Ideally, it would have been advantageous to have information on continuous monitoring of
BP or at least daily monitoring during therapy. Such frequent assessment, however, was not part of the prescribed
monitoring schedule for these patients, and is a shortcom-

ing of the study. In addition, because not all patients with
MCCRCC treated with sunitinib during this time had
blood collected for genotyping (eg, due to disease-related
anemia), it is possible that some bias may have been introduced, for example, by implicitly excluding patients who
were not genotyped, but who developed severe HTN
while on sunitinib. Furthermore, management of HTN
was physician-dependent as was sunitinib dose adjustments, both of which will need to be controlled in a uniform manner for prospective validation.
The impact of the VEGF and VEGFR2 SNPs
identified in this study to be indicators of toxicity and outcome coupled with pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies that indicate impact of increased exposure
to sunitinib on outcome and adverse events25 or biomarker response to sunitinib26 could provide a rational
basis for improving clinical benefit of treatment in
MCCRCC patients. The overlap in VEGF SNPs correlated with HTN after bevacizumab or sunitinib treatment

suggest that effects on VEGF homeostasis and pharmacogenomics of VEGF/VEGFR2 are possibly involved in
adverse toxicity observed with the combination of bevacizumab plus sunitinib in patients with RCC.27-29
In summary, VEGF SNP 634 correlates with
HTN and genotypes of VEGF SNP 936, and VEGFR2
889 correlate with overall survival during sunitinib therapy in this cohort of RCC patients. Prospective study in a
larger cohort of patients is warranted to validate these
findings as well as determine if the VEGF SNPs and
VEGFR2 SNPs identified to impact HTN in patients
treated with sunitinib are also relevant to treatment with
other TKIs used in the clinical management of RCC.
