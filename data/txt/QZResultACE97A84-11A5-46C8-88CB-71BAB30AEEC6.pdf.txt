Abstract
Cell-based drug screenings indicate that tumors displaying c-MET gene ampliﬁcation are "addicted" to MET
signaling and therefore are very sensitive to MET-targeted agents. However, these screenings were conducted
in the absence of the MET ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which is abundant in the tumor
microenvironment. Sensitivity of six MET-addicted human tumor cells to three MET kinase inhibitors
(JNJ-38877605, PHA-665752, crizotinib) and one antagonistic anti-MET antibody (DN30 Fab) was analyzed
in the absence or presence of HGF, in a stroma–tumor coculture system, and by combining anti-MET drugs
with an HGF neutralizing antibody (ﬁclatuzumab) in human HGF knock-in mice bearing c-MET–ampliﬁed
tumors. In all models examined, HGF promoted resistance to MET-targeted agents, affecting both their
potency and efﬁcacy. HGF-induced resistance was due to restoration of physiologic GAB1–mediated PI3K
activation that compensated for loss of aberrant HER3-dependent PI3K signaling. Ficlatuzumab restored
sensitivity to MET-targeted agents in coculture systems and overcame resistance to JNJ-38877605, crizotinib,
and DN30 Fab in human HGF knock-in mice. These data suggest that c-MET–ampliﬁed tumor cells—which
normally exhibit ligand-independent, constitutive MET activation—become dependent on HGF for survival
upon pharmacologic MET inhibition. Because HGF is frequently overexpressed in human cancer, this
mechanism may represent a major cause of resistance to anti-MET therapies. The ability of ﬁclatuzumab
to overcome HGF-mediated resistance generates proof of principle that vertical inhibition of both a tyrosine
kinase receptor and its ligand can be therapeutically beneﬁcial and opens new perspectives for the treatment
of MET-dependent tumors. Cancer Res; 74(22); 6598–609. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Several independent studies have identiﬁed c-MET gene
ampliﬁcation as the most predictive genetic event associated
with high sensitivity to MET-targeted agents (1). In a screen for
human tumor cell lines sensitive to PHA-66572, a MET-selective, ATP-competitive tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI; ref. 2), 5 of
5 gastric carcinoma cell lines bearing multiple c-MET gene
copies (MKN-45, GTL-16, SNU-5, Hs746T, KATO II) displayed
high sensitivity to MET inhibition (3). A similar study identiﬁed
the same gastric carcinoma cell lines plus 2 additional lung cell
lines (EBC-1, H1993), also displaying c-MET gene ampliﬁcation,

as highly susceptible to PHA-66572 inhibition (4). RNAi conﬁrmed that lung carcinoma cells bearing multiple copies of
c-MET strictly depend on MET signaling for survival and
growth (5). The same c-MET–ampliﬁed tumor cells (GTL-16,
Hs746T, SNU-5, EBC-1, H1993) were found to be highly sensitive to DN30 Fab, the Fab fragment of a monoclonal anti-MET
antibody inducing MET "shedding" (6). Recently, we (7) and
others (8) analyzed the activity of different MET-targeted
agents, including PHA-66572, JNJ-38877605 (an ATP-competitive, MET-selective TKI; ref. 9), crizotinib (a MET–ALK dual
inhibitor; ref. 10), and DN30 Fab, on different human tumor cell
lines, either bearing normal c-MET gene copy number or
displaying c-MET ampliﬁcation. Both these studies conﬁrmed
that only c-MET–ampliﬁed tumor cells are sensitive to MET
inhibition in proliferation assays, independently of whether
this was achieved by tyrosine kinase blockade or receptor
downregulation. Consistent with these experimental ﬁndings,
crizotinib displayed therapeutic activity in patients with lung
carcinoma (11) and esophagogastric adenocarcinoma (12)
bearing c-MET–ampliﬁed tumors.
Ampliﬁcation of c-MET also accounts for resistance to antiEGF receptor (EGFR) therapies in a signiﬁcant fraction of
patients treated with geﬁtinib or erlotinib (13–15). In EGFRaddicted tumors, survival and growth rely on EGFR-mediated
transactivation of the HER3–PI3K pathway (16). Focal ampliﬁcation of c-MET has been shown to result in MET-dependent

HGF Protects MET-Addicted Tumors against MET-Targeted Agents

HER3 transphosphorylation, thus permitting PI3K activation
in the presence of EGFR inhibitors (13). Interestingly, METmediated resistance to EGFR inhibitors in lung cancer can also
occur in the absence of c-MET ampliﬁcation via hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF)-induced activation of the PI3K–AKT
pathway (17, 18). In this case, however, PI3K signaling is
sustained by recruitment of the GAB1 adaptor protein—the
physiological MET signal transducer—and not by transphosphorylation of HER3 (19). Consistent with a role of HGF in
mediating resistance to EGFR inhibitors, acquired resistance
to geﬁtinib and erlotinib in patients with lung cancer is
associated with high HGF levels in the tumor microenvironment (17, 20) and in plasma (21).
Recently, 2 studies systematically investigating the effect of
growth factors on the response to targeted anticancer agents
using a wide panel of oncogene-addicted human cancer cells
identiﬁed HGF as the most relevant microenvironment-borne
source of resistance (22, 23). Both these works recognized a
recurrent theme in HGF-mediated resistance: PI3K re-activation, compensating for the survival signal transduced by the
targeted kinase. Interestingly, PI3K also represents a key
mediator of survival in MET-addicted tumor cells (13, 24).
However, surprisingly, the role of HGF in innate or acquired
resistance to MET-targeted agents has not been investigated.
In this study, we analyzed the inﬂuence of tumor microenvironment–derived HGF on the response to MET-targeted
therapy using a panel of human tumor c-MET–ampliﬁed cell
lines and 4 different MET inhibitors, including JNJ-38877605,
PHA-66572, crizotinib, and DN30 Fab. To this end, we measured sensitivity of MET-addicted cells to anti-MET drugs in
the presence of HGF and in coculture systems using HGFsecreting human ﬁbroblasts. Because mouse HGF does not
activate human MET, we also used genetically engineered
human HGF knock-in (hHGF KI) SCID mice that express
human HGF in place of mouse HGF. Using ﬁclatuzumab, a
neutralizing anti-HGF antibody (25), we examined the in vivo
relevance of microenvironment-derived HGF in determining
the response of c-MET–ampliﬁed human tumors to anti-MET
drugs.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
MKN-45, Hs746T, SNU-5, H1993, A549, A2780, U87-MG, and
MRC-5 cells were obtained from the European Collection of
Cell Cultures and cultured as suggested by the supplier. EBC-1
cells were obtained from the Japanese Collection of Research
Bioresources. GTL-16 cells have been described before (26).
EBC-1 and GTL-16 cells were maintained in RPMI (Sigma Life
Science) supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 mmol/L glutamine
(Sigma Life Science). GTL-16 and EBC-1 cells were engineered
to express luciferase by lentiviral vector technology using the
pRRL-luciferase vector as described (27). Genetic identity of
each cell line was conﬁrmed by short tandem repeat proﬁling
using Cell ID System (Promega) in November 2013.
Cell-based drug-sensitivity assays
For HGF assays, cells were seeded in 96-well plates (1,000
cells per well). The day after, cells were treated with increasing

www.aacrjournals.org

concentrations of the indicated drug in the presence of the
appropriate concentration of recombinant human HGF (R&D
Systems). After 3 days, cell number was determined using Cell
Titer Glo (Promega) with a Victor X4 multilabel plate reader
(Perkin Elmer). For ﬁclatuzumab assays, GTL-16 and EBC-1
cells were seeded in 96-well plates (1,000 cells per well) in the
presence of ﬁclatuzumab as indicated. The day after, cells were
treated with increasing concentrations of JNJ-38877605 or
DN30 Fab plus the appropriate concentration of HGF (R&D
Systems). Cell viability was determined 3 days later as above.
For coculture experiments, MRC-5 ﬁbroblasts (1,000 cells per
well) and GTL-16-luc or EBC-1-luc (1,000 cells per well) were
seeded concomitantly in 96-well plates in the presence of
ﬁclatuzumab. The day after, cell mixtures were incubated with
increasing concentrations of JNJ-38877605 as indicated. Cell
viability was determined 3 days later by measuring luciferase
activity using a Luciferase Reporter Assay System kit (Promega). Samples were analyzed with a GloMax 96 Microplate
Luminometer (Promega). Cell proliferation data were analyzed
and ﬁt using Prism software (GraphPad). HGF concentration in
conditioned medium was determined by ELISA using a human
HGF Quantikine ELISA kit (R&D Systems).
Signal transduction analysis
GTL-16, MKN-45, and H1993 cells were incubated with the
indicated drug concentrations for 24 hours (JNJ-38877605) or 48
hours (DN30 Fab) in the absence or presence of 100 ng/mL HGF
(R&D Systems) and then processed for immunoblotting as
described (28). Total cell lysates were analyzed by Western
blotting using the following antibodies: anti-phospho-MET,
anti-phospho-HER3, anti-phospho-AKT, anti-AKT, anti-phospho-ERK, anti-ERK, anti-phospho-S6, and anti-S6 (Cell Signaling Technology); anti-MET (Life Technologies); anti-HER3
(Santa Cruz Biotech). MKN-45 and H1993 cell lysates were
also analyzed by Western blotting using anti-GAB1 antibodies
and anti-phospho-GAB1 antibodies (Cell Signaling). For assessment of MET-associated phospho-proteins, cell lysates were
immunoprecipitated as described (28) using the DQ13 antiMET antibody (29) followed by Western blotting with antiphospho-HER3 antibodies (Cell Signaling), anti-phospho-GAB1
antibodies (Cell Signaling), and anti-PI3K antibodies (Millipore). For the assessment of PI3K-associated phospho-proteins, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated as above using antiPI3K antibodies (Millipore) followed by Western blotting with
anti-phospho-HER3 antibodies (Cell Signaling), anti-phosphoGAB1 antibodies (Cell Signaling), and anti-PI3K antibodies
(Millipore). MET shedding was analyzed as described (6).
Mouse models of cancer
Wild-type CB17 SCID mice and hHGF KI SCID mice were
obtained from Charles River and AVEO Pharmaceuticals,
respectively (see online Supplementary Methods). In all in vivo
experiments, tumor growth was monitored over time using a
caliper and the formula V ¼ 4/3p  (1/2x)  (1/2y)  (1/2z),
where x, y, and z are the 3 dimensions of the tumor. Cell
injection, animal randomization, and treatment were performed as indicated in the Results. The M162 human colon
carcinoma sample has been described before (30). Statistical

HGF protects MET-addicted cancer cells against MET
TKI–induced growth inhibition
To determine whether tumor microenvironment–borne
signals could inﬂuence genetically determined sensitivity to
anti-MET drugs, we incubated a panel of human tumor cell
lines displaying c-MET gene ampliﬁcation (GTL-16, MKN-45,
SNU-5, Hs746T gastric carcinoma; H1993, EBC-1 lung carcinoma) with increasing concentrations (0–1,000 nmol/L) of a
MET-selective TKI (JNJ-38877605; ref. 9) in the presence of 0, 10,
30, or 100 ng/mL recombinant human HGF. As control, we also
incubated 2 human tumor cell lines bearing normal c-MET

gene copy number (A549 lung carcinoma; U87-MG glioblastoma) and 1 human tumor cell line not expressing MET (A2780
ovary carcinoma) in the same conditions. Cell viability was
determined after 3 days by measuring total ATP content (Fig. 1).
In the absence of HGF, JNJ-38877605 inhibited MET-addicted
cell growth with IC50 ranging from 11 nmol/L (SNU-5) to 50
nmol/L (H1993) and EMAX varying between 53% (Hs746T) and
91% (MKN-45) but did not affect the growth of control cells.
In the presence of HGF, however, the sensitivity of c-MET–
ampliﬁed cells to JNJ-38877605 decreased substantially, whereas the response proﬁle of control cells remained unaltered.
HGF protected all MET-addicted cells against JNJ-38877605–
induced growth inhibition in a dose-dependent fashion. At the
maximum concentration tested, HGF caused an IC50 increase
ranging from 5 times (H1993) to 23 (Hs746T) but did not
substantially change the EMAX (Supplementary Table S1). An

identical analysis was performed on selected cell lines (GTL-16,
MKN-45, EBC-1) using two other small-molecule MET TKIs
(PHA-665752, ref. 2; crizotinib, ref. 10). In analogy to the results
obtained with JNJ-38877605, HGF decreased sensitivity of
c-MET–ampliﬁed cells to these drugs in a dose-dependent
fashion (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B). At 100 ng/mL HGF,
the IC50 of PHA-665752 increased by 5 times (GTL-16), 9 times
(MKN-45), and 13 times (EBC-1), whereas the IC50 of crizotinib
increased by 5 times (GTL-16 and MKN-45) and 24 times (EBC1; Supplementary Table S1). In contrast, the EMAX values did
not show any substantial change. These results indicate
that HGF signiﬁcantly reduces the potency of MET TKIs on
MET-addicted cancer cells.
HGF sustains HER3-independent PI3K signaling in
c-MET–ampliﬁed cells exposed to MET TKIs
In cells with normal c-MET gene copy number, MET signaling typically occurs via the multi-adaptor protein GAB1
(31). In contrast, MET signal transduction in c-MET–ampliﬁed
tumor cells is characterized by transphosphorylation of HER3,
which in turn activates various downstream pathways independently of GAB1 (13, 24). To cast light onto the molecular
mechanisms underlying HGF-induced growth rescue, we incubated GTL-16 cells with increasing concentrations (0–200
nmol/L) of JNJ-38877605 in the absence or presence of 100
ng/mL HGF. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting
using antibodies directed against different signaling molecules
(Fig. 2A). In the absence of HGF, 50 nmol/L JNJ-38877605
inhibited constitutive MET autophosphorylation to an extent
sufﬁcient for completely abrogating its downstream signal
transduction, including phosphorylation of HER3, AKT, ERK,

and S6 kinase. Interestingly, HGF partially rescued activation of
MET, AKT, ERK, and S6 but did not rescue HER3 phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). To determine the signaling pathways activated by HGF, we immunoprecipitated cell lysates with antibodies directed against MET or PI3K and examined coprecipitating phosphotyrosine proteins by Western blotting. This
analysis revealed that HGF stimulation in the presence of JNJ38877605 promotes de novo MET association with phosphoGAB1 (Fig. 2B), which becomes associated with PI3K at the
expenses of HER3 (Fig. 2C). Similar results were also obtained
by analyzing MET signal transduction in MKN-45 and H1993
cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). Taken together, these results
suggest that HGF antagonizes JNJ-38877605–induced growth
inhibition by promoting PI3K–GAB1 association rather than
by rescuing PI3K–HER3 interaction.
HGF protects MET-addicted cancer cells against antiMET antibody-induced growth inhibition
Next, we measured the ability of HGF to interfere with
growth inhibition mediated by an anti-MET antibody Fab
fragment that promotes MET "shedding" and downregulation
(DN30 Fab; ref. 6). To this end, we incubated the same panel
of MET-addicted human tumor cells with increasing concentrations (0–1,600 nmol/L) of DN30 Fab in the presence of 0, 10,
30, or 100 ng/mL HGF. Cell viability was determined after 3
days as described above (Fig. 3). In the absence of HGF, DN30
Fab inhibited the growth of cells bearing multiple c-MET
gene copies with IC50 ranging from 81 nmol/L (SNU-5) to
380 nmol/L (Hs746T) and EMAX varying between 30% (H1993)
and 87% (GTL-16) but did not affect proliferation of control
cells. Remarkably, the sensitivity of MET-addicted cells to

and one cell line not expressing MET (A2780) were also incubated in the same conditions. Cell number was determined after 3 days by measuring total ATP
content and expressed as percentage relative to the untreated control.

DN30 Fab decreased signiﬁcantly in the presence of HGF. In
GTL-16 and MKN-45 cells, an HGF concentration of 10 ng/mL
increased the IC50 by 3 and 2 times, respectively. In the
remaining four MET-addicted cell types, the lowest HGF
dose was sufﬁcient to prevent DN30 Fab from causing more
than 50% growth inhibition, thus precluding IC50 calculation
(Supplementary Table S1). In contrast to MET TKIs that
displayed reduced potency but unaltered efﬁcacy, DN30 Fab
showed both increased IC50 and decreased EMAX (Supplementary Table S1). In the presence of 100 ng/mL HGF, DN30
Fab inhibited GTL-16 and MKN-45 cell growth by 30% and
35%, respectively, whereas it did not show any measurable
inhibitory activity in SNU-5, Hs746T, H1993, and EBC-1 cells
(Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S1). These data suggest

that HGF can rescue MET-addicted cells from growth
inhibition induced by different types of MET-targeted
agents, including small-molecule kinase inhibitors and
monoclonal antibodies.
HGF restores physiologic MET signaling in anti-MET
antibody-treated MET-addicted cells
Analysis of MET levels in DN30 Fab–treated cells revealed
that HGF does not interfere with DN30 Fab–induced MET
shedding (Fig. 4A). The rescuing activity of HGF could
instead be explained by the very high MET levels in
c-MET–ampliﬁed cells. In fact, DN30 Fab completely abrogated MET expression in cells displaying normal MET levels,
but it only reduced MET expression in MET-addicted cells,

resulting in physiologic receptor levels (Fig. 4B). We hypothesized that these levels may still be competent for transducing HGF-mediated signals, thus allowing HGF to sustain
PI3K activation in DN30 Fab–treated MET-addicted cells. To
test this hypothesis, we incubated GTL-16 cells with increasing concentrations (0–1,600 nmol/L) of DN30 Fab in the

partially rescued phosphorylation of MET and AKT. To
investigate the molecular signals linking MET to AKT in
the absence of phosphorylated HER3, we immunoprecipitated cell lysates with anti-MET antibodies or with anti-PI3K
antibodies and analyzed coprecipitating phosphotyrosine
proteins by Western blotting. This analysis revealed that,
in analogy to the results obtained with JNJ-38877605, HGF
did not rescue MET-mediated transphosphorylation of
HER3 but rather promoted de novo association and transphosphorylation of GAB1 (Fig. 4D), which in turn recruited
PI3K (Fig. 4E). Similar signal transduction data were also
obtained using MKN-45 and H1993 cells (Supplementary Fig.
S3). These results support our hypothesis that residual MET
expression on MET-addicted cells allows HGF to sustain
PI3K signaling in the presence of DN30 Fab, thus permitting
cell survival and growth.

Neutralization of HGF restores sensitivity to METtargeted agents in a stroma–epithelium coculture system
To investigate whether HGF-induced resistance to METtargeted agents can be reverted by neutralizing HGF, we
incubated GTL-16 gastric and EBC-1 lung carcinoma cells with
increasing concentrations of JNJ-38877605 (0–1,000 nmol/L) or
DN30 Fab (0–1,600 nmol/L) in the presence of 50 ng/mL HGF
plus 0, 15, 30, or 60 mg/mL ﬁclatuzumab, a monoclonal
antibody directed against HGF (25). Total ATP content analysis
revealed that ﬁclatuzumab restored sensitivity to JNJ-38877605
in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 5A). Ficlatuzumab-mediated
rescue was more potent in GTL-16 cells, which are less
sensitive to HGF-mediated resistance than EBC-1 cells. Ficlatuzumab also restored sensitivity to DN30 Fab in GTL-16 cells
(Fig. 5B, left) but not in EBC-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4A). In
the latter cell model, the rescuing activity of ﬁclatuzumab
could be unmasked by lowering HGF concentration to 5 ng/mL

HGF Protects MET-Addicted Tumors against MET-Targeted Agents

GTL-16 and EBC-1 cells to JNJ-38877605 in a dose-dependent
fashion. These results suggest that paracrine secretion of HGF
represents a relevant source of resistance in this system,
although it is likely that other stroma-secreted cytokines also
contribute to promoting tumor cell survival and growth.

(Fig. 5B, right). This is explained by the fact that in EBC-1 cells, a
concentration of 50 ng/mL HGF is well above the saturation
threshold (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Because HGF is typically
provided paracrinally by the tumor stroma (32), we further
explored the therapeutic potential of ﬁclatuzumab in an in
vitro model of stroma–tumor cell coculture. Luciferase-expressing GTL-16 gastric and EBC-1 lung carcinoma cells were
cocultured with immortalized human ﬁbroblasts secreting
HGF, which reached a concentration of 100 ng/mL after 3
days of coculture. Mixed cultures of stroma–tumor cells were
incubated with increasing concentrations (0–1,000 nmol/L) of
JNJ-38877605 in the presence of 0, 15, 30, or 60 mg/mL ﬁclatuzumab, and tumor cell viability was determined 3 days after
by measuring luciferase activity. Luciferase-expressing tumor
cells alone were also subjected to the same treatment, and drug
sensitivity in the presence of stromal cells was compared with
that of tumor cells alone (Fig. 5C). Remarkably, and consistent
with the HGF concentrations measured in the coculture
system, stromal cells determined a decrease in drug sensitivity
comparable with that observed with the higher doses of
recombinant HGF. Ficlatuzumab restored sensitivity of

Ficlatuzumab sensitizes MET-addicted tumors to
MET-targeted agents in hHGF KI SCID mice
It is well established that mouse HGF binds to human MET
with lower afﬁnity and fails to activate it (33, 34). To overcome
this limitation and to explore the therapeutic potential of
ﬁclatuzumab in the appropriate context, we used hHGF KI
SCID mice, which express human HGF in place of mouse HGF
(Supplementary Fig. S5). The ability of ﬁclatuzumab to cooperate with different MET-targeted agents was analyzed using 3
distinct c-MET–ampliﬁed human tumor models. In the ﬁrst
model, EBC-1 lung carcinoma cells were injected subcutaneously into hHGF KI mice and into wild-type SCID mice as
control. When experimental tumors reached a volume of
approximately 50 mm3, mice were randomly assigned to the
following treatment arms: control; 30 mg/kg ﬁclatuzumab; 5

administration continued for a total of 34 days. B, EBC-1 cells were injected subcutaneously into hHGF KI SCID mice. Tumor-bearing animals were

C, Hs746T cells were injected subcutaneously into hHGF KI SCID mice, and the animals were immediately divided into four treatment groups: control (CTRL);
ﬁclatuzumab 30 mg/kg (F30); PEGylated DN30 Fab 5 mg/kg (D5); ﬁclatuzumab 30 mg/kg þ PEGylated DN30 Fab 5 mg/kg (F30 þ D5). Drug administration

ﬁclatuzumab. Ficlatuzumab was administered twice weekly by
intraperitoneal injection; JNJ-38877605 was administered daily
by oral gavage. Drug administration continued for approximately 1 month. Tumor volume measurement over time
revealed that JNJ-38877605 potently inhibited tumor growth
in wild-type SCID mice (84% inhibition; Fig. 6A), whereas it only
partially reduced it in hHGF KI SCID mice (49% inhibition; Fig.
6B). Ficlatuzumab alone did not have any effect in either wildtype SCID mice or hHGF KI mice. However, combination of
JNJ-38877605 and ﬁclatuzumab signiﬁcantly blocked tumor
growth (83% inhibition) in hHGF KI mice, resulting in stable
disease (Fig. 6B). ELISA of tumor cell extracts with phosphoAKT antibodies conﬁrmed our in vitro observation that HGFmediated resistance to JNJ-38877605 correlates with sustained
PI3K activity (Supplementary Fig. S6A). In the second model,
Hs746T gastric carcinoma cells were injected into hHGF KI
SCID mice as above, and mice were immediately divided
into four treatment groups: control; 30 mg/kg ﬁclatuzumab;
5 mg/kg PEGylated DN30 Fab; and 30 mg/kg ﬁclatuzumab þ 5
mg/kg PEGylated DN30 Fab. Both drugs were administered
twice weekly by intraperitoneal injection for a period of 35
days. In this system, ﬁclatuzumab and DN30 Fab reduced
tumor growth by 50% and 63%, respectively. However, their
combination was much more efﬁcient, achieving 80% tumor
inhibition and demonstrating a signiﬁcant cooperative effect
(Fig. 6B). In the last model, a human tumor sample (M162) from
a colorectal carcinoma "xenopatient" library (35) that bears
approximately 30 c-MET gene copies (30) was propagated
subcutaneously in human hHGF KI SCID mice. Animals
bearing tumors of approximately 400 mm3 were randomly
divided into 6 treatment arms: control; 30 mg/kg ﬁclatuzumab;
20 mg/kg crizotinib; 40 mg/kg crizotinib; 20 mg/kg crizotinib þ
30 mg/kg ﬁclatuzumab; and 40 mg/kg crizotinib þ 30 mg/kg
ﬁclatuzumab. Crizotinib was administered daily by oral
gavage; ﬁclatuzumab was administered twice weekly by intraperitoneal injection. Treatment continued for a total of 53 days.
Analysis of tumor burden over time revealed that ﬁclatuzumab
alone and 20 mg/kg crizotinib did not elicit any effect on tumor
growth. Increasing crizotinib concentration to 40 mg/kg
achieved 55% tumor inhibition, although drug toxicity reached
its maximum tolerability at this dose in this mouse strain.
Interestingly, the combination with 30 mg/kg ﬁclatuzumab
sensitized tumors to 20 mg/kg crizotinib (32% inhibition) and
cooperated with 40 mg/kg crizotinib, leading to tumor stabilization (78% inhibition). Immunohistochemical analysis of
tumor sections revealed that crizotinib, could not effectively
reduce phospho-S6 kinase levels in the absence of ﬁclatuzumab (Supplementary Fig. S6B), thus further strengthening the
idea that activation of the PI3K pathway plays a crucial role in
HGF-induced resistance to anti-MET drugs.

Discussion
In the present study, we report that HGF causes resistance
of c-MET–ampliﬁed cancer cells to treatment with smallmolecule MET TKIs and anti-MET antagonistic antibodies,
bypassing genetically determined sensitivity to MET-targeted
agents. Given that cells displaying high-grade, focal ampliﬁ-

6606

cation of c-MET express high levels of the MET protein,
resulting in ligand-independent, constitutive MET kinase
activation (1), this ﬁnding is somehow counterintuitive. Yet
the data presented here explain this apparent paradox at a
molecular level, providing insights into the biology of c-MET
oncogene addiction.
Tumor cells bearing normal c-MET gene copy number are
strictly dependent on HGF for MET activation that leads to
execution of a variety of HGF-dependent biologic programs,
but they do not rely on MET signaling for intrinsic survival
and growth (1). Accordingly, cells not displaying c-MET gene
ampliﬁcation are insensitive to MET inhibition in proliferation assays (3, 4, 7, 8), regardless of the presence or absence
of HGF (see Figs. 1 and 3 and Supplementary Table S1). In
contrast, c-MET–ampliﬁed, MET-overexpressing tumor cells
are "addicted" to MET signaling, which occurs independently
of ligand stimulation in normal conditions. In these cells, the
survival signal originating from MET is transduced through
an aberrant pathway that involves interaction with a partner
receptor tyrosine kinase, typically HER3 (13). Indeed, inhibition of MET in these cells resulted in HER3 inactivation
and downstream PI3K signal silencing. HGF did not rescue
HER3 activation but restored PI3K signaling through recruitment of the physiologic GAB1 adaptor (Figs. 2 and 4). This
signaling adaptor shift may be explained by the different
mechanisms of MET activation involved. MET protein overexpression increases the probability of receptor–receptor
collision, therefore equally favoring both homodimerization
(MET with MET) and heterodimerization (MET with other
receptors, including HER3). In contrast, HGF stimulation
conceivably results primarily in stabilization of MET homodimers. This could explain why HGF-induced MET activation is qualitatively different from overexpression-sustained
MET activation, and the two signals behave de facto as two
distinct redundant pathways in terms of cell survival.
The above-described mechanism makes MET-addicted cells
become "hooked on" paracrine HGF for survival when they are
challenged with MET-targeted agents. But how does HGF
activate MET in the presence of a MET inhibitor? The molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are different for
small-molecule kinase inhibitors and antagonistic antibodies.
In the case of MET TKIs, HGF-induced MET activation—due to
ligand-mediated stabilization of MET homocomplexes—is
conceivably less sensitive to MET kinase inhibition than
MET-induced HER3 transactivation. Consistent with this
hypothesis, HGF caused dose-dependent increase of MET TKI
IC50 but did not affect their EMAX (i.e., it reduced their potency
and not their efﬁcacy). However, HGF induced an IC50 increase
ranging from 5 to 24 times (Supplementary Table S1), a change
that is in line with the IC50 shifts induced by multiple rescuing
cytokines in a recent major study on targeted drug resistance
(23). In the case of antagonistic antibodies that reduce MET
expression by inducing "shedding" or internalization (6, 36, 37),
the mechanism responsible for HGF-induced rescue may rely
on the fact that expression of MET in c-MET–ampliﬁed cells is
way above the physiologic level, and antagonistic antibodies
decrease MET expression down to normal levels rather than
abrogating it (Fig. 4). Hence, even in the presence of saturating

HGF Protects MET-Addicted Tumors against MET-Targeted Agents

antibody concentrations, these MET levels may still guarantee
a normal HGF signal transduction, leading to effective compensation for loss of aberrant, HER3-mediated PI3K activation.
The peculiar biology of the MET ligand makes it highly
likely that microenvironment-derived HGF represents an
important source of innate and acquired resistance to
MET-targeted therapies. In fact, HGF is secreted by cells of
mesenchymal origin—including ﬁbroblasts, macrophages
and endothelial cells—as an inactive precursor (pro-HGF)
that accumulates in the extracellular matrix of tissues owing
to its high avidity for glycosaminoglycans. Moreover, during
tissue repair and cancer invasion, several cytokines in the
reactive interstitial compartment induce transcriptional
upregulation of pro-HGF in both ﬁbroblasts and resident
macrophages (38, 39). Conversion of pro-HGF into an active,
heterodimeric a-b ligand is catalyzed by speciﬁc proteases
abundant in the tumor microenvironment, including urokinase-type plasminogen activator, HGF activator, a variety of
proteases of the blood clotting cascade and multiple metalloproteases (40, 41). Inﬂammation further enhances proHGF conversion by upregulating matriptase and proteases of
the plasminogen activation system (42).
The importance of environmental HGF in the resistance
to targeted agents and in cancer biology in general has been
historically underestimated in preclinical studies due to the
fact that mouse HGF does not activate human MET (33, 34).
Therefore, all in vivo studies investigating the role of MET in
tumor progression and therapy conducted using human
xenografts in mice favored the identiﬁcation of cell-autonomous, HGF-independent processes but inhibited the study
of ligand-dependent phenomena. To overcome this limitation, we used an engineered mouse model in which the
mouse HGF gene was replaced by a human HGF cDNA by
homologous recombination. Unlike transgenic mice overexpressing human HGF on top of the endogenous ligand
(34), hHGF KI mice express HGF driven by the endogenous
mouse promoter and therefore maintain physiologic expression levels (Supplementary Fig. S5).
The ability of HGF-neutralizing antibodies such as ﬁclatuzumab to sensitize c-MET–ampliﬁed tumors to MET-targeted
agents generates proof of concept that vertical inhibition of a
tyrosine kinase receptor and its ligand can be therapeutically
beneﬁcial. From a clinical perspective, this possibility can be
exploited by two different approaches. It is well established
that small-molecule ATP-competitive inhibitors give rise to
off-target toxicity at high doses. In many cases, this toxicity
poses a relevant limitation to their clinical use and may lead to
clinical development interruption. Combination of an antiMET drug with ﬁclatuzumab or another anti-HGF antibody
(43, 44) would allow achieving the same therapeutic goal using

a lower dose of MET inhibitor, thereby reducing off-target side
effects. Alternatively, combination with anti-HGF antibodies
could be envisioned to enhance the pharmacologic effect of a
MET-selective drug, thus accomplishing a more favorable
therapeutic response at the highest tolerated dose. With
respect to the latter possibility, it should be kept in mind that
only a minor fraction of patients eligible for a targeted therapy
based on genetic testing respond clinically to pharmacologic
blockade of the corresponding target (45). Considering the high
levels of HGF frequently found in the tumor microenvironment, innate resistance to MET inhibitors in a signiﬁcant
percentage of these nonresponders could probably be overcome by HGF neutralization using agents like ﬁclatuzumab,
thereby contributing to increasing the overall response rate.
