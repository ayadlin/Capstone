BACKGROUND: Erlotinib is a highly active epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitor that is approved for first-line use
in lung cancers harboring EGFR mutations. Anecdotal experience suggests that this drug may provide continued disease control after
patients develop objective progression of disease (PD), although this has not been systematically studied to date. METHODS:
Patients who had Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors-defined PD who were participating in 3 prospective trials of first-line
erlotinib in advanced lung cancer were studied retrospectively, and the progression characteristics were compared between patients
with and without EGFR-sensitizing mutations. Factors were studied that influenced the time until treatment change (TTC), defined as
the time from PD to the start of a new systemic therapy or death. The rate of tumor progression was assessed by comparing tumor
measurements between the computed tomography scan obtained at the time of PD and the preceding scan. RESULTS: In total, 92 eligible patients were studied, including 42 with and 50 without an EGFR-sensitizing mutation. The EGFR-mutant cohort had a slower
rate of progression (P 5.003) and a longer TTC (P <.001). Among the patients with EGFR-mutant cancers, 28 (66%) continued
single-agent erlotinib after PD, and 21 (50%) were able to delay a change in systemic therapy for >3 months; only 2 patients received
local debulking therapy during that period. Multivariate analysis of the patients with EGFR-mutant tumors demonstrated that a longer
time to progression, a slower rate of progression, and a lack of new extrathoracic metastases were associated with a longer TTC.
CONCLUSIONS: A change in systemic therapy commonly can be delayed in patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer who objectively
progress on first-line erlotinib, particularly in those with a longer time to progression, a slow rate of progression, and a lack of new

INTRODUCTION
First-line treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for patients with
lung cancer who harbor EGFR mutations has made a transformative impact on the care of advanced non–small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC). Erlotinib, which has been commercially available in the United States since 2004, is a reversible tyrosine
kinase inhibitor (TKI) that has a response rate of 64% and a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 9.7 months when
received as first-line therapy by patients with EGFR exon 19 deletions and L858R (leucine to arginine change at codon
858) mutations.1
Anecdotal experience has described the ability to maintain disease control with erlotinib when continuing this drug
beyond objective progression of disease (PD) on a clinical trial (as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid
Tumors [RECIST]).2 Particularly in patients who have indolent or asymptomatic progression,3 this has potential as an
attractive strategy that could delay the use of more toxic cytotoxic chemotherapy. However, the feasibility and safety of
this approach is not well described in the literature, leaving many oncologists reluctant to continue erlotinib in the face of

radiographic progression. Even on the recently reported
ASPIRATION trial, which was designed to prospectively
study the efficacy of erlotinib continuation after objective
progression, 46% of patients had their erlotinib immediately stopped at the time of initial objective progression.4
Indeed, in some regions of the world, EGFR TKIs will no
longer be reimbursed by payers if radiographic progression has been identified, whether or not the clinician
believes that the patient is still benefitting from the drug.
To better define the role of postprogression erlotinib
in delaying a change in systemic therapy, a cohort of
patients who received treatment until they developed
RECIST-defined PD on 3 prospective trials of first-line
erlotinib administered within the Dana-Farber/Harvard
Cancer Center were studied. Our objectives were: 1) to
study the feasibility and effectiveness of delaying a change
in treatment after objective progression using erlotinib, 2)
to study this phenomenon in lung cancers without TKIsensitive EGFR mutations as a control cohort, and 3) to
identify patient-specific progression characteristics associated with successful postprogression treatment using erlotinib off protocol.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients with NSCLC from 3 prospective trials of firstline erlotinib who were enrolled between March 2003 and
April 2009 were studied retrospectively. All patients were
included from a phase 2 trial of first-line erlotinib in elderly patients with advanced NSCLC (clinicaltrials.gov
identifier NCT00137800), the results of which were previously published.5 Second, patients at our centers were
included from the erlotinib arm of a multicenter, randomized phase 2 trial of first-line erlotinib with or without
chemotherapy for never/light smokers with lung adenocarcinoma (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00126581),
the results of which also were previously published.6
Finally, all patients were included from a phase 2 trial of
first-line erlotinib in women with advanced lung adenocarcinoma (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00137839),
with the results also previously reported.7 Each of these
trials included prospective studies of response and the
time to progression (TTP) according to RECIST (version
1.0).2 Patients were deemed eligible for our analysis if
they initiated erlotinib on study and continued treatment
on study until they were diagnosed with objective PD
according to RECIST, allowing calculation of the TTP
for each patient. Patients who stopped treatment early
because of toxicity, withdrew consent, or died were
excluded; therefore, no patients were censored from this
TTP calculation.

EGFR genotyping was performed when feasible as
part of each study using Sanger-sequencing of exons 18
through 21 or the WAVE HS system (Transgenomic
North America, New Haven, Conn), as previously
reported.8 Because EGFR genotype is a fundamental biomarker for predicting outcome in patients who receive
erlotinib, patients who are unable to complete EGFR genotyping were excluded from this analysis. The remaining
patients were divided into 2 cohorts for comparison: those
with a TKI-sensitive EGFR mutation (the EGFR-mutant
cohort) and those without a TKI-sensitive EGFR mutation (the EGFR wild-type cohort).
The management of patients after they came off protocol because of objective progression was reviewed,
including the systemic and local therapies they subsequently received. Because erlotinib has been commercially
available in the United States since its initial approval by
the US Food and Drug Administration in 2004, patients
were able to initiate commercial erlotinib after coming off
study at the discretion of the treating provider. The time
between coming off study and either starting a subsequent
systemic therapy or death was calculated and defined as
the time until treatment change (TTC), regardless of
whether erlotinib was stopped or restarted during that period and whether or not the patient received local therapy.
The start of any new systemic therapy, including chemotherapy, investigational therapy, or an EGFR TKI other
that erlotinib, was considered a treatment change. The
time between coming off study because of PD and death
was calculated and defined as the postprogression survival.
Progression characteristics were assessed individually
for each patient. The rate of progression of measurable
disease was assessed by a thoracic radiologist (M.N.). To
focus on the progression rate at the time of PD, the
summed greatest tumor dimension on the computed tomography scan documenting progression was measured
and compared with the summed greatest tumor dimension on the immediate preprogression scan; this could be
a negative value if measurable disease had decreased while
there was progression in nonmeasurable disease. Progression imaging was also compared qualitatively with pretreatment imaging to determine the presence of new sites
of extrathoracic metastatic disease (eg, new development
of brain, bone, liver, adrenal, or other metastases). The
TTC was then studied in the context of progression characteristics, which were hypothesized to impact clinical decision making: 1) the TTP on initial erlotinib, 2) the
presence or absence of new extrathoracic metastases, and
3) the rate of progression of the measurable disease (in
centimeters per month).

Figure 1. This a chart of the patient cohort from the current analysis. Of 184 patients who were enrolled on 3 trials of first-line
erlotinib, 92 patients were eligible, including 42 with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-sensitive epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) mutations and 50 without TKI-sensitive EGFR mutations. PD indicates progressive disease.

RESULTS
In total, 177 patients from 3 trials were studied (Fig. 1).
Seventy-four patients were excluded from the analysis, 46
because they had incomplete EGFR genotyping and 28
because they stopped the study drug before developing
objective progression on erlotinib. This left 103 patients
eligible for our analysis, 11 of whom were lost to followup after coming off study and could not be evaluated. The
remaining 92 patients were the study population, including 42 who had tumors that were positive for a TKIsensitive EGFR mutation (21 exon 19 deletions,
16 L858R mutations, 5 other mutations) and 50 who had
wild-type tumors for a TKI-sensitive EGFR mutation.
The patient characteristics are presented in Table 1.
Patients in the EGFR-mutant cohort, as expected, were
more likely to be never smokers (52% vs 24%; P 5 .01),
Asians (10% vs 0%; P 5 .04), and women (88% vs 70%;
P 5 .04). The patient population mostly had stage IV disease at diagnosis (80%), and the histologic subtype of
NSCLC was almost entirely nonsquamous (98%).
Patients in the EGFR-mutant cohort had a longer TTP on
first-line erlotinib than those in the EGFR wild-type
cohort (14 months vs 1.8 months), as anticipated.
There were some differences in progression
characteristics between patients with and without a TKIsensitive EGFR mutation (Table 1). Patients in the EGFRmutant cohort had a median progression rate of 0.2 cm
per month (range, 20.1 to 2.0 cm per month), which was
slower than the median progression rate in the EGFR
wild-type cohort of 0.5 cm/month (range, 20.9 to 4.8 cm
2572

per month; P 5 .003). The likelihood of new extrathoracic metastases at the time of progression was similar in the
EGFR-mutant and EGFR wild-type cohorts (24% vs
10%, respectively; P 5 .09). The median postprogression
survival was numerically longer in the EGFR-mutant
group (median, 18.1 months; 95% confidence interval
[CI], 11.3-28.2 months) than in EGFR wild-type group
(median, 9.9 months; 95% CI, 6.4-18.8 months),
although the difference was not statistically significant
(P 5 .12).
Patients who had EGFR-mutant cancers had a significantly longer time to a change in systemic therapy
compared with those who had EGFR wild-type cancers,
with a median TTC of 3.2 months (95% CI, 0.5-1.4
months) versus 0.6 months (95% CI, 1.5-8.6 months;
P < .001) (Fig. 2). In the EGFR-mutant cohort, 6 of 42
patients (14%) died before starting a new systemic therapy; whereas, in the EGFR wild-type cohort, 16 of 50
patients (32%) died before starting a new systemic therapy. Therefore, we conducted a competing risk analysis of
TTC adjusting for death as a competing risk: The estimated cumulative incidences of treatment change at 1
month and 3 months based on these models were 26%
and 41%, respectively, for EGFR-mutant cancers and
52% and 58%, respectively, for EGFR wild-type cancers.
Twenty-three percent of patients received local therapy
during the period before a change in systemic therapy,
and the proportion was similar in both cohorts despite the
prolonged TTC in the EGFR-mutant cohort (Table 1).
The majority of local therapies were standard palliative

To characterize the prolonged TTC in the EGFRmutant cohort, management after progression on firstline erlotinib was studied (Fig. 3). Of the 42 EGFR-mutant patients, 28 continued single-agent erlotinib for 0.2

postprogression erlotinib for an additional 21 months
before starting the patient on a clinical trial.
Two patients underwent local debulking therapy, as
mentioned above. One of these patients, after nearly 6
years on erlotinib, underwent resection of a 3-cm lung
2574

tumor that was the only site of progression. After 6
months off erlotinib, she developed multifocal pulmonary
recurrence, so the erlotinib was restarted for 2 more years
until the patient was lost to follow-up and died. The other
patient, after 14 months on erlotinib, underwent stereotactic body radiation therapy to a 2.8-cm lung tumor that
was the only site of progression. Erlotinib was restarted
for 3 months, after which she developed additional intrathoracic disease and was started on a clinical trial.
To further define the characteristics that impact the
decision to delay a treatment change in patients with
EGFR-mutant lung cancer, the correlations between the 3
progression characteristics described above and TTC were
assessed in a multivariate analysis (Table 2). A longer TTP
on initial erlotinib, progression without any new extrathoracic metastases, and a slower rate of linear progression
all were associated significantly with a longer TTC.
DISCUSSION
Genotype-directed, targeted therapies are transforming
the care of NSCLC and, at the same time, are forcing us
to reconsider our approach to disease progression on targeted therapy. Many patients, after having dramatic and
durable responses to EGFR kinase inhibitors with tolerable side effects, are reluctant to change therapy based on
asymptomatic progression on imaging. Indeed, many
clinical trials specifically allow continuation of TKI therapy after objective progression if it is believed that the
patient is having clinical benefit,9 a criterion that, to date,
is poorly defined. However, experience with this approach
has not been systematically assessed. In the current study,
we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by retrospectively evaluating a cohort of patients with objective
progression on first-line erlotinib from three prospective
trials. We observed that, among patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer who are able to receive erlotinib until
they develop objective progression, most are able to delay
a change in systemic therapy for 3 months or more after
objective progression, and 21% can delay a change in systemic therapy for more than 12 months. Our findings
provide context to the recently reported results from the
IRESSA Mutation-Positive Multicenter Treatment
Beyond Progression Study (IMPRESS) trial, which demonstrated that, in patients who had EGFR-mutant lung
cancer with progression on first-line gefitinib, continuing
gefitinib when initiating doublet chemotherapy did not
improve the response rate or PFS.10 Although this trial
establishes doublet chemotherapy as the standard of care
after progression on first-line EGFR TKI, our data suggest
that this switch to doublet chemotherapy can potentially

Objective progression occurred after 14 months (m), but the patient did not develop cancer-related symptoms and did not start a new therapy
until 39 months, 2 years after progression of disease (PD). PD was defined as objective disease progression according to

Our current analysis of a cohort in the United Stated
complements the recent report from a prospective study
of this approach that enrolled in Asia (ASPIRATION),4
in which patients with advanced, EGFR-mutant lung cancer received first-line erlotinib until they developed objective progression, followed by optional postprogression
erlotinib until clinical progression prompted the treating
physician to switch therapies. Of 171 patients in that
study who had objective disease progression, 78 (46%)
were taken off erlotinib at the time of progression, and 93

(54%) were continued on erlotinib by their provider. In
the subset that continued on postprogression erlotinib,
the median clinical TTP was 14 months compared with a
median objective TTP of 11 months for those who were
taken off erlotinib.
One limitation of the ASPIRATION study is the
lack of a control arm. In our current study, we observed
that treatment with erlotinib beyond progression was relatively infeasible for patients without TKI-sensitive EGFR
mutations, with a median TTC of only 0.6 months after
progression on first-line erlotinib. This is presumably
because erlotinib is an ineffective therapy in these patients,
2575

resulting in a faster rate of progression. In addition, our
study identifies progression characteristics associated with
a longer TTC in patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer,
including a longer TTP on initial erlotinib, a lack of new
extrathoracic metastases at progression, and slower growth
of measurable disease. If prospectively validated, such
characteristics may be used by clinicians as they try to
determine which patients may be able to delay a treatment
change using postprogression erlotinib.
The favorable postprogression course we describe in
this report was observed despite the rare use of local
debulking therapies. Although 24% of patients received
local therapies, the vast majority of these received conventional palliative radiation, like that received for brain metastases and symptomatic thoracic or bone lesions. In an
uncontrolled, single-center report, investigators previously described the use of local ablative therapy (LAT) for
patients who had advanced EGFR-mutant or anaplastic
lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged lung cancers with oligoprogression on TKI therapy.11 In 25 patients who were
deemed suitable for local therapy, a median PFS of 6.2
months was observed when a TKI was restarted after
LAT. In our prospective cohort, 11 patients (26%)
delayed a change in systemic therapy for more than 6
months without receiving LAT. In another single-center
report of 184 patients who had acquired resistance to
EGFR TKIs, 18 patients (10%) with favorable outcomes
(median TTP, 19 months on initial TKI) underwent elective, noncentral nervous system, local therapy, which
resulted in a median TTC of 22 months.12 In our prospective cohort, 4 patients (10%) delayed a change in systemic therapy for more than 22 months without the
receipt of elective local therapy. The finding that many
patients on our study could delay a change in systemic
therapy without any local intervention raises the possibility that the outcomes observed in this population may be
related to the indolent biology of oligoprogressive cancers
rather than the efficacy of the local therapy itself (as in the
patient presented in Fig. 4). Before debulking therapies
like surgery or high-dose radiation become accepted
approaches for our patients with metastatic, EGFR-mutant NSCLC and an isolated site of progression, it would
be prudent to pursue controlled studies to assess the outcomes of local therapy compared with those of standard
systemic therapy for advanced disease.
The emergence of third-generation, mutant-specific
EGFR TKIs with antitumor activity against T790Mmediated resistance may change this paradigm of continuing a TKI beyond progression, given the reported
response rates >50% in patients who received AZD9291
2576

and CO-1686 and the potential for limited toxicity.13,14
The EGFR T790M mutation (threonine to methionine
substitution at position 790) has been associated with indolent growth characteristics in some preclinical and clinical studies compared with other mechanisms of
resistance.3,15 Therefore, patients who have slow progression on first-line EGFR TKI may wish to pursue a
rebiopsy for T790M testing to start a third-generation
EGFR TKI rather than continuing on a TKI until clinical
symptoms prompt a switch to second-line chemotherapy.
Indeed, the availability of clinical trials likely had an
impact on the results of this report, because 33% of
patients in the EGFR-mutant cohort started a second-line
clinical trial after first-line erlotinib; if cytotoxic chemotherapy had been their only second-line option, then these
patients may have delayed treatment change for an even
longer period. It is noteworthy that a resistance biopsy for
T790M testing is not always technically feasible: for those
with indolent progression, it may be safe to continue on a
postprogression TKI and consider attempting a resistance
biopsy at a future date.
The findings presented here have potential impact
on clinical trial design in NSCLC for patients with EGFR
mutations and other oncogenic drivers. Objective progression is currently a standard trial endpoint for regulatory approval of genotype-directed, targeted therapies.
However, we observe that objective progression is not the
same as treatment failure, because many patients can continue on targeted therapy after RECIST progression. A
similar finding has been described in ALK-rearranged
NSCLC, in which 1 study demonstrated that >50% of
patients who had acquired resistance to crizotinib continued the drug for more than 3 weeks after objective progression.16 This may mean that objective progression as
currently defined is not optimal for use as a trial endpoint
given its lack of clinical applicability. To provide context
to a PFS analysis in a randomized trial, it would be useful
if trials also reported progression characteristics like the
rate of progression, the presence of new metastases, and
the symptom burden at progression for each arm.
There are several limitations to this study. Although
EGFR genotyping to guide first-line therapy was not
standard during the period of these trials, EGFR genotype
may have been available to investigators for some of these
patients and may have influenced their decision to treat
with postprogression erlotinib off study. Although this
bias may have shortened the TTC for patients in the
EGFR wild-type cohort, our data nonetheless clearly demonstrate the feasibility of delaying treatment change in
patients with EGFR mutations who progress on erlotinib.

There is also potential bias in our use of the novel endpoint TTC to demonstrate the feasibility of delaying a
new systemic therapy. This endpoint is an intuitive evolution of time to failure of strategy, a composite endpoint like
including death, objective progression, or initiation of a
new therapeutic agent;17 and objective progression is
omitted from our definition of TTC because our hypothesis is that this radiographic event is not clinically significant for all patients. It is noteworthy that we are not able
to determine from our data whether a delay in treatment
change may have an impact on overall survival; indeed, in
a patient with symptomatic progression, delay of an effective second-line therapy is likely to have a deleterious
effect.
In conclusion, this is the first report to demonstrate
the feasibility of delaying a change in systemic therapy after RECIST progression on EGFR TKI in a prospectively
assembled cohort of patients with EGFR-mutant lung
cancer. This study complements emerging data from the
ASPIRATION study and suggests that postprogression
erlotinib can safely be adopted as a component of routine
lung cancer care. Our data support the recent revision to
the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines
for NSCLC (version 4.2015; www.nccn.org, accessed
March 3, 2015), which now recommend continued postprogression EGFR TKI in certain subtypes of progression.
The progression characteristics we describe as associated
with a delay in treatment change may aid clinicians in
their decision making as they consider continuing EGFR
TKIs after patients have objective disease progression on
confirmed on imaging.
