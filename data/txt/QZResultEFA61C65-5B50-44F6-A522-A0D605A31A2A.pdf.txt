Functional Flow Patterns and Static Blood Pooling
in Tumors Revealed by Combined ContrastEnhanced Ultrasound and Photoacoustic Imaging
Avinoam Bar-Zion1, Melissa Yin2, Dan Adam1, and F. Stuart Foster2,3

Abstract
Alterations in tumor perfusion and microenvironment have
been shown to be associated with aggressive cancer phenotypes,
raising the need for noninvasive methods of tracking these
changes. Dynamic contrast–enhanced ultrasound (DCEUS) and
photoacoustic (PA) imaging serve as promising candidates—one
has the ability to measure tissue perfusion, whereas the other can
be used to monitor tissue oxygenation and hemoglobin concentration. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the
different functional parameters measured with DCEUS and PA
imaging, using two morphologically different hind-limb tumor
models and drug-induced alterations in an orthotopic breast

tumor model. Imaging results showed some correlation
between perfusion and oxygen saturation maps and the ability
to sensitively monitor antivascular treatment. In addition,
DCEUS measurements revealed different vascular densities in
the core of speciﬁc tumors compared with their rims. Noncorrelated perfusion and hemoglobin concentration measurements facilitated discrimination between blood lakes and
necrotic areas. Taken together, our results illustrate the utility
of a combined contrast-enhanced ultrasound method with photoacoustic imaging to visualize blood ﬂow patterns in tumors.

Introduction

Contrast-enhanced ultrasound involves the use of gas-ﬁlled
microbubbles. Using special pulse sequences and processing
techniques the signal originating from the microbubbles can be
separated from the soft tissue background (3). Furthermore,
microbubbles are similar in size to red blood cells making them
ideal for the imaging of blood (4). DCEUS is an established
imaging mode for the measurement of functional tissue perfusion, providing us with insights on blood ﬂow and blood volume
inside localized tissue regions (5).
PA imaging combines optic and acoustic imaging into a single
modality. Short laser pulses directed to the tissue generate regional thermo-elastic expansion and create acoustic waves that are
detected by an ultrasound transducer at the surface of the tissue
(6, 7). By encoding optical contrast onto acoustic waves, the
penetration depth is greatly increased, while retaining the high
contrast and spectral speciﬁcity of optical imaging. PA imaging is
an excellent tool for the visualization of blood, or more specifically hemoglobin in tissue (8, 9). Furthermore, the differing
absorption spectra of deoxygenated and oxygenated hemoglobin make it possible to monitor oxygen saturation (SO2) in vivo
through the use of multiwavelength imaging, allowing for hypoxia detection in tissue.
There are two commonly accepted forms of hypoxia: diffusionlimited and perfusion-limited (2). Tumor cells located around
functional blood vessels are supplied with oxygen and nutrients.
When the distance from these vessels increases, the result is
decreased pO2 levels, characterizing diffusion-limited hypoxia.
Perfusion-limited hypoxia on the other hand is transient and
caused by irregularities in blood ﬂow within the tumor vasculature. As both the structure and functional status of tumor vasculature are important factors that affect the oxygenation of tumor
tissue, it is important to have imaging tools that can be used to
investigate changes in perfusion, such as DCEUS, and monitor
changes the oxygenation, such as PA imaging.

To ensure survival and progression, tumor cells have acquired a
number of characteristics or "hallmarks" that differentiate them
from normal cells. Theses speciﬁc traits, including the ability to
induce abnormal angiogenesis, have been a major area of focus in
cancer research (1). In addition to genetically altered cellular
characteristics, tumor microenvironmental factors, such as hypoxia, also play an important part in cancer progression and
aggressive phenotypes (2). Knowledge of changes in tumor perfusion and microenvironmental patterns is of great importance
for detecting aggressive cancer phenotypes and determining the
effects of different treatments. Therefore, there is a need for
noninvasive imaging methods capable of tracking both changes
in tumor perfusion and its microenvironment. Dynamic contrast–
enhanced ultrasound (DCEUS) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging
are two noninvasive functional imaging modalities, having the
potential to facilitate the monitoring of tumor development and
treatment efﬁciency.

Functional Flow Patterns and Static Blood Pooling in Tumors

In addition to SO2, hemoglobin concentration can also be
estimated from PA measurements. Hemoglobin is usually
purely intravascular. However, the leakiness of tumor vasculature can lead to extravasation of erythrocytes outside the vessel
walls to form static hemorrhagic regions (blood lakes) in some
tumors. Defects in the endothelial monolayer are known to
explain the leakiness of tumor vessels (10). Both blood lakes
and necrotic regions do not incorporate functional vasculature,
thus have low perfusion values and potentially high hemoglobin content.
In this study, we examined the advantages of using DCEUS
combined with PA imaging. Previous work performed using
scanners combining DCEUS and PA imaging tend to analyze
physiologic properties estimated using each modality separately
(e.g., ref. 11). This sort of analysis could miss functional characteristics that may be derived from comparing the two different
but complimenting datasets.
This study assessed the relationship between perfusion parameters measured using DCEUS, and SO2 and hemoglobin concentration measured using PA imaging in two experiments. In the
ﬁrst experiment, the spatial relationship between DCEUS and PA
parameters was studied at high resolution using two different
hind-limb tumor models with different vascular morphology. In
the second experiment, the ability of DCEUS and PA imaging to
detect global drug–induced functional perfusion and oxygenation
changes in the tumor was studied using an orthotopic model of
human breast cancer. Histopathology was used to validate the
imaging results.

Materials and Methods
Tumor models
Xenograft tumors were induced in mice using either LS174T
human colorectal cancer cells, or PC3 human prostate cancer
cells. Both cell lines were cultured in Gibco DMEM (Life
Technologies Inc.) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone).
A total of 1  106 cells were injected subcutaneously into the
left hind limb of female 8-week-old SHO mice (Charles River
Laboratories). The tumors were scanned after they reached a
depth of 4–6 mm.
Orthotopic primary breast tumors were induced using 231/
LM2-4 cells, a metastatic variant of the human MDA-MB-231
breast cancer cell line (12). A small incision in the lower abdominal skin was made above the right inguinal mammary fat pad
(MFP) of female 8-week-old SHO mice (Charles River Laboratories), followed by the injection of 2  106 cells into the exposed
MFP. The skin was then closed with surgical staples and allowed to
heal. Tumors were allowed to grow to an approximate volume of
200 mm3 before being imaged and treated. All procedures were
completed with the animal anesthetized under isoﬂurane and in
accordance with Sunnybrook Health Science Centre's approved
protocol for Animal Care and Use.
Drug induction of tumor microenvironmental changes using
Oxi-4503
Tumor ischemia was induced in the orthotopic breast tumors
model using a tubulin-binding vascular disrupting agent: Oxi4503 (OXiGENE Inc.). Each mouse was given either an intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg/kg of Oxi-4503 or injectable saline and
allowed 4 hours for the drug to take effect before being imaged
again for post-treatment effects.

Noninvasive imaging of tumors
All in vivo imaging was performed using a laser integrated
high-frequency ultrasound system (Vevo LAZR, VisualSonics
Inc.). In the ﬁrst experiment, 6 hind-limb tumors were imaged
for each tumor type. In the second experiment involving drug
induction of tumor microenvironmental changes, two groups
of mice were imaged (n ¼ 6 per group) at two separate time
points, once before the injections were given, then a second
time 4 hours after injection. All animals were anesthetized with
2% isoﬂurane (Abbott Laboratories Limited) delivered in combination with 1 L/minute oxygen. A 27G butterﬂy needle was
inserted into a lateral tail vein for intravenous injection of
the ultrasound contrast agent (UCA). A linear array transducer
with ﬁber optical bundles integrated to each side (LZ-250,
fc ¼ 21 MHz) was used to deliver light from a tunable laser
(680–970 nm). The tumor was ﬁrst imaged employing B-mode
imaging for region of interest (ROI) selection, followed by PA
and contrast mode. PA images were acquired using two alternating wavelengths (750 nm and 850 nm). Contrast-enhanced
images were collected after a 50-mL bolus injection of MicroMarker UCA (VisualSonics Inc.) using nonlinear contrast imaging. All three-dimensional (3D) PA data were acquired by
moving the transducer with a stepper motor, at a step size of
50 mm.
Image analysis
In the hind-limb experiments, the recorded PA images and
DCEUS cines were loaded into a personal computer and analyzed
ofﬂine using in-house MATLAB programs. To estimate the local
time–intensity curves (TIC) in the DCEUS movies, temporal
wavelet denoising was applied to each pixel in the scans (13).
From the denoised scans, three different perfusion parameters
were estimated, producing high-resolution parametric maps of
the tumors: peak enhancement, the difference between maximum
amplitude, and the baseline intensity of the wash-in curve, used as
an indication of the tumor blood volume; wash-in rate, the
maximum slope of the curve, used as an indication of blood
ﬂow rate; and area under the curve, the integrated difference
between the intensity value and its baseline. To estimate the local
correlation between different perfusion parameters and oxygenation level, or hemoglobin concentration estimations, the normalized correlation was assessed between each pair of parameters
for each pixel.
In the experiment of tumor microenvironmental changes
caused by the injected drug, all image analysis was completed
ofﬂine on the Vevo Lab. PA data were collected as a 3D image stack
containing 150 to 200 SO2 2D images. A ROI encompassing
the tumor was drawn for each image to determine the averaged
SO2 value for each tumor. The ROI selection was done with
reference to the anatomic B-mode image. After averaging the
contrast intensity in each ROI, global TICs were generated and
quantiﬁed using Vevo CQ. Two parameters were taken from the
TICs: peak enhancement, and wash-in rate.
Histology of tumors
All animals were sacriﬁced after the last contrast-enhanced
ultrasound imaging, for tumor tissue collection. Tumors were
excised and cut in half in the same plane as the imaging plane and
ﬁxed in formalin for 48 hours before processing. All tissues were
cut into 5-mm sections, and stained with either hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E), or immunostained with carbonic anhydrase

9 (CA9) or cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31) for hypoxia and
angiogenesis, respectively. For the ﬁrst experiment, a single set
of sections was collected from each tumor. As part of the second
experiment, four sections spaced 350 mm apart were collected
from each tumor. The Leica SCN400 (Leica Microsystems Inc.)
slide scanner was used for tumor visualization, under bright
ﬁeld at 40 magniﬁcation.
CD31 staining was analyzed with Sedeen Viewer, version
4.0.x., counting the number of vessel structures per mm2 area of
tumor slice. Necrotic regions, blood vessels, hypoxic areas, and
blood lakes were separated from viable tissue regions using
thresholding performed in MATLAB following the use of
the color deconvolution plugin in the ImageJ software. Subsequently, necrotic regions and blood lakes were classiﬁed using a
MATLAB GUI. Regions were segmented and marked as blood
lakes if they included red blood cells or plasma and were not
surrounded by endothelial cells in the matching CD31 staining.
CA9 expression was quantiﬁed in MATLAB as percentage area
of positive stain per tumor slice. To produce composite histologic images, the masks of hypoxic regions produced from CA9
stains were aligned with the masks of necrotic regions, blood
lakes, and red blood cells derived from H&E stains (Supplementary Fig. S1), using the control point registration MATLAB
function.
Statistical analysis
Statistical functions in MATLAB were used to assess the
statistical signiﬁcance of differences between the various measurements performed on PC3 and LS174T tumors. In addition
to the correlation between DCEUS and PA parameters, different
histologic parameters were compared between the two tumors.
As Gaussian distributions were not assumed, the Wilcoxon
rank-sum test was used and the results were considered signiﬁcant for values of 0.05 > P.
The program PASW Statistics 18 was used to assess the
statistical signiﬁcance of differences in mean values of DCEUS
and PA parameters and the histologic markers in response to
the Oxi-4503 treatment. A two-tailed independent samples t
test or paired samples t test was used to assess the signiﬁcance
of the mean difference.

Results
LS174T and PC3 tumor xenografts displayed signiﬁcantly
different perfusion and oxygenation patterns
Comparison of DCEUS parametric maps and processed PA
scans revealed detailed information about the spatial relationship between perfusion, oxygenation, and hemoglobin
distribution in the tumors. Sample images of these functional
maps taken from LS174T and PC3 tumors are shown in Fig. 1.
DCEUS scans of LS174T tumors presented highly perfused rim
with resolvable blood vessels in their cores. These vessels were
surrounded by many small nonperfused regions (Fig. 1C). Oxygen saturation maps showed high SO2 in the rim of the tumors
and low SO2 in their cores, corresponding well to the DCEUS
perfusion maps (Fig. 1E). In contrast to perfusion and SO2
patterns, the distribution of hemoglobin was almost uniform in
the tumor (Fig. 1G).
PC3 tumors showed distinctively different anatomic and functional maps. While the rims of PC3 tumors were highly perfused,
their core contained large poorly perfused and nonperfused

4322 Cancer Res; 76(15) August 1, 2016

regions (Fig. 1D). Large resolvable vessels were not detected in
any of the perfusion maps. High SO2 levels were measured
throughout the tumors' rim (Fig. 1F), with low SO2 detected in
the core—measured only in regions where the concentration of
hemoglobin was high enough to enable oxygen saturation estimations (Fig. 1H). However, vast core regions appeared black,
with no detectable hemoglobin concentration.
Overall tumor perfusion correlated with oxygen saturation,
but showed discrepancies when compared with hemoglobin
distribution
Different perfusion parameters were estimated from high resolution TICs produced from DCEUS scans. The parameters evaluated included peak enhancement, wash-in rate, and area under
the curve (AUC, see Fig 1C and D). Similar patterns were observed
in the tumor perfusion and oxygen saturation maps, with areas
of high SO2 reﬂective of areas of high blood perfusion. To quantify and evaluate the relationship between the different functional
parameters, the correlation between corresponding pixels in the
perfusion parametric maps and oxygen saturation maps were
assessed. A similar analysis was also performed to evaluate the
correlation between different perfusion parameters and hemoglobin concentration. On the basis of this local spatial analysis,
reasonable correlation between the perfusion AUC parameter and
SO2 was observed for both LS174T and PC3 tumors (Fig. 2A, r ¼
0.63  0.06 and r ¼ 0.49  0.10 respectively, n ¼ 6). In contrast,
the correlation between perfusion and hemoglobin concentration
varied signiﬁcantly between the two tumor models (Fig. 2B, P ¼
0.0022, n ¼ 6) and was negligible for LS174T tumors.
Vessel distribution analysis using histology showed
markedly different vascular morphology between LS174T
and PC3 tumors, conﬁrming DCEUS observations
We further examined the differences in perfusion pattern
between LS174T and PC3 tumors using immunohistochemistry.
Tumors were stained with CD31, a widely used endothelial
marker for tumor neovascularization (14, 15), to compare the
vascular morphology of the two tumor models. In LS174T
tumors, the core was characterized by large deformed blood
vessels (Fig. 3A, top right, arrows) that were separated from one
another by more than 100 mm—the resolution of DCEUS scans
taken in this study. This was reﬂective of what we observed in the
perfusion maps, where large resolvable vessels were present at the
core of the tumors. In contrast, PC3 tumors were characterized by
small vessels distributed across its core (Fig. 3A, bottom right,
arrows). In comparison with the LS174T tumors, vessels found in
PC3 tumors were located much closer to each other. CD31þ
microvessel counts showed signiﬁcantly lower density of large
vessels in PC3 tumors compared with LS174T tumors (Fig. 3B, n ¼
6, P ¼ 0.0087). In addition, LS174T tumors exhibited signiﬁcantly
higher density of open lumen vessels compared with PC3 tumors
(Fig. 3C, n ¼ 6, P ¼ 0.0022).
Discrepancies between tumor perfusion and hemoglobin
distribution were explained with further histologic analysis,
revealing hemorrhagic regions in LS174T tumors
We conducted detailed examination of CD31 and H&E stains
to understand the disagreement observed between perfusion and
hemoglobin distributions. Histology revealed distinctive morphology differences between the two tumor types, with variable
distributions of necrotic regions and blood lakes. CD31 staining

were used to differentiate functional vessels from blood lakes
based on the absence of endothelial cells (CD31þ stains) from
blood lakes' edges.
On the basis of H&E staining, LS174T tumors were characterized by a highly viable periphery (Fig. 4A, left, dark
purple), with a core that contained a mosaic of blood lakes
(light pink, dashed arrows), large deformed blood vessels, and
necrotic regions (light purple, arrowheads). The presence of
blood lakes gave insight to the discrepancy that was observed
in areas of high hemoglobin concentration where both perfusion and SO2 were low. Similar to LS174T tumors, the rims

of PC3 tumors were also composed of highly viable tissue
(Fig. 4A, right). However, the cores of PC3 tumors were
characterized by large necrotic regions, with no signs of hemorrhagic blood lakes. Necrotic regions in both tumors had low
erythrocytes content with few sparse extravasated erythrocytes
detectable (Fig. 4D, yellow arrows), pointing to the remaining
of dead vessels.
The ﬁndings regarding the different composition of LS174T and
PC3 tumors were conﬁrmed with statistical analysis. The proportion of necrotic regions in PC3 tumors were signiﬁcantly higher
than in LS174T tumors (Fig. 4B, n ¼ 6, P ¼ 0.004). On the other

hand, blood lake areas (10.94  6.61 %) were detected only in
LS174T tumors (Fig. 4C).
Histology conﬁrmation of tissue necrosis, hypoxia, and
blood lakes suggest that DCEUS and PA imaging should
be used in conjunction to separate regions of necrosis
from hypoxia
In addition to H&E and CD31, both LS147T and PC3 tumors
were also stained for CA9 to validate and compare patterns of
hypoxia in the two tumor types. To present a complete histologic
image displaying necrotic regions, blood lakes, and hypoxic
regions, CA9 and H&E images were segmented and overlaid.
A representative composite histologic image of each tumor is
shown in Fig. 5A, along with the matching oxygen saturation and
perfusion maps for comparison. Red blood cells are shown as
white dots, but are not observable in PC3 tumors in the displayed
resolution, due to the small sizes of the vessels.
Amidst the areas of necrosis and blood lakes prevalent in
the cores of LS174T tumors, there are also vast areas of
hypoxia (Fig. 5A, top left). This is correlative of the matching
oxygen saturation and perfusion maps (Fig. 5A, left, middle,
and bottom plots), where regions of low SO2 were found to
concentrate at the core of the tumors, where only sparse large
vessels were found. Areas of necrosis and hypoxia could not
be differentiated using oxygen saturation maps alone, as low
SO2 was observed in the core of the tumors even in the presence
of functional vessels. In contrast to LS174T, only small and
scarce areas of hypoxia were found in PC3 tumors, surrounding
the borders of necrotic tumor regions (Fig. 5A, top right).
Histology results were in agreement with matched oxygen
saturation maps, showing areas of low to no SO2 at the tumor
core (Fig. 5A, right middle). However, in this case, low PA
signal was a result of tissue necrosis and sparse vessels, which
limited the estimation of SO2. This was conﬁrmed by contrastenhanced perfusion maps showing large nonperfused areas
at the center of PC3 tumors. To quantitatively evaluate the
difference between the SO2 patterns in the two tumor types,
histograms of SO2 values normalized to the total tumor area
were calculated (Fig. 5B). LS174T tumor histogram showed
higher frequencies of low SO2 and much lower frequencies of
high SO2. In contrast, PC3 tumors displayed relatively similar frequencies of SO2 across the board, but had much lower
overall detected SO2, suggesting that markedly larger regions

4324 Cancer Res; 76(15) August 1, 2016

in PC3 tumors did not produce sufﬁcient PA signal. Quantiﬁcation of CA9 stains showed signiﬁcantly larger hypoxic regions in LS174T tumors compared with PC3 tumors (Fig. 5C,
n ¼ 6, P ¼ 0.0022).
Functional imaging reveals reduced perfusion and oxygen
saturation in response to Oxi-4503 treatment
Contrast assessment of tumor perfusion is shown in Fig. 6A,
which displays sample images of an Oxi-4503–treated mouse
before and after treatment. In the pretreatment image, contrast
signal enhancement can be observed in the surrounding tissue
and throughout the periphery of the tumor. This, however, is
changed 4 hours after the injection of Oxi-4503, showing a
very dark tumor center with much less signs of enhancement.
As illustrated in Fig. 6B, both groups of mice showed similar
levels of peak enhancement and wash-in rate before treatment.
However, when tumor perfusion was measured again 4 hours
after, a signiﬁcant change was observed in the Oxi-4503–
treated mice, with an 82.1% and 80.5% decrease in tumor
blood volume and ﬂow rate, respectively, P < 0.01. This
statistically signiﬁcant change was not observed with the
control mice.
PA assessment of tumor oxygenation is shown in the two
lower panels of Fig. 6A, which display sample images of an Oxi4503–treated mouse before and after treatment. Areas of high
oxygenation are shown in bright red, and dark red for low
oxygenation regions, while black represents no oxygenation or
low PA signal. From the images, it can be observed that the
tumor is well oxygenated around the periphery, with very low
oxygenation toward the center. This, however, is changed after
the injection of Oxi-4503, with very low to no SO2 signal seen
throughout the tumor 4 hours after treatment. This was
expected, as Oxi-4503 is known to induce localized hypoxia
inside the tumors as a result of vessel collapse. The averaged
percentage of SO2 for Oxi-4503–treated mice showed a 37.2%
decrease in tumor oxygenation after treatment, with P < 0.01
(Fig. 6C). This statistically signiﬁcant change was not observed
with the control.

response to Oxi-4503 treatment

in location lacking functional blood vessels. B, the number of large vessels (surrounded by more than 5 endothelial cells) per tumor area was signiﬁcantly

ﬁndings. Shown in Fig. 7A are representative images from H&E
and CA9 stains for each group. The control H&E stain displays a
large nonviable region in the inner core of the tumor (light
purple), and the adjacent image shows brown positive staining
for CA9 localized as a rim lining this inner core. However, the
Oxi-4503–treated sample presented a different pattern, with
multiple foci of CA9-positive regions found throughout the
tumor and in viable regions as shown by its H&E staining.
Figure 7C demonstrates consistency in n ¼ 6 with approximately
40% more CA9 staining than the control group. Figure 7B
presents sample sections of tumor slices from each group
stained for CD31, with positive brown staining for vessels. As
shown in the ﬁgure, the control group appears to have more

vessels per area than the drug-treated group. This ﬁnding was
conﬁrmed with all of the animals, with Fig. 7D showing that the
control group had an approximately 2-fold higher vessel density
than the Oxi-4503–treated group.

Discussion
In recent years, scanners combining several noninvasive
imaging modalities are becoming increasingly popular in clinical and preclinical imaging due to their ability to provide additional and complimentary information on the imaged tumor
(e.g., refs. 16 and 17). In this study, we examined the advantages of using DCEUS combined with PA as a diagnostic tool,

and as a tool for monitoring antivascular treatment. It was
shown that a multimodality imaging scheme combining
DCEUS and PA produce additional information about the
presence of viable tissue, hemorrhagic regions, and necrotic
areas. To the best of our knowledge, this level of discrimination
has not previously been published with the individual
modalities.
Correlation and discrepancies between perfusion maps and
oxygen saturation patterns
Previous studies have shown using histology, the spatial
relationship between hypoxic and perfused tissue regions in
speciﬁc xenograft tumors (18). Hypoxia was shown to develop
in tissue separated from functional vessels by a distance of
approximately 100 mm. On the basis of this we expected to ﬁnd
a correlative relationship between perfusion and SO2 in our
imaging maps. The pixel-wise correlation between parametric
perfusion and oxygen saturation maps in both LS174T and PC3
tumors were moderately good (r ¼ 0.63  0.06 and r ¼ 0.49 
0.10, respectively, n ¼ 6). However, it seems that a global linear
regression does not fully capture the relation between these
functional parameters. Moreover, in the LS174T tumors, low
SO2 was detected throughout the core even though large

4326 Cancer Res; 76(15) August 1, 2016

functional vessels were apparent in the DCEUS scans. Histopathologic analysis combining information from H&E, CA9,
and CD31 stains showed the presence of hypoxia but not
necrosis in the vicinity of functional vessels, in accordance
with previous studies. This inconsistency between PA SO2
estimations and histology results may be due to the fact that
tumor cells only show hypoxic stress under extremely low
oxygenation levels (2). The resolution needed for detection
of extremely low SO2 levels could be challenging for nontomographic PA scanners. These challenges are especially dominant in higher depths, due to the wavelength-dependent
absorption (19).
DCEUS perfusion maps reveal information on vascular
morphology
As single vessels could not be resolved in PA scans, DCEUS
perfusion maps were crucial in detecting difference in vascular
morphology between different regions of each tumor, and
between the two tumors types. Resolvable large vessels were
detected in the core of LS174T tumors, while the rim of these
tumors had relatively uniform perfusion. These results were
validated using histology, which showed large deformed functional vessels in the center of LS174T tumors, surround by areas of

Functional Flow Patterns and Static Blood Pooling in Tumors

information from H&E, CA9, and CD31 stains (top) are presented against SO2 images (middle panels) and perfusion maps (bottom panels). The
cores of LS174T (top left) are embedded with blood lakes (red), small necrotic regions (blue), and large hypoxic regions (yellow). Viable tumor
tissue is presented in black and red blood cells appear as white dots. In agreement, the cores of LS174T tumors are characterized by low SO2 (middle left).
The perfusion map of the LS174T tumor shows large vessels in the tumor core separated by nonperfused areas. In contrast, only small patches of
hypoxic cells are found in PC3 tumors concentrated around the rims of the vast necrotic regions (top right). The absence of hemoglobin in
necrotic regions inside PC3 tumors and low signal originating from small vessels can explain the high percentage of tumor area with low PA signal
in PC3 tumors (bottom middle). The perfusion map in the right bottom panel resembles the histologic composition of the tumor. Scale bars, 1 mm.

hypoxia (Figs. 3A and 5A, respectively). Previous studies have
shown that larger and leakier vessels are generally associated with
regions of hypoxia, afﬁrming our observations (20). In contrast to
LS174T tumors, large resolvable blood vessels could not be found
in any of the PC3 DCEUS scans, suggesting that the tumors were
composed of relatively smaller, compact vessels. This was supported by histology showing small and densely clustered vessels
in the viable regions of PC3 tumors, with minimal signs of
hypoxia (Figs. 3A and 5A, respectively). A certain (global) indication of the hypoxic nature of the LS174T tumors can be derived
from the histograms of SO2 measurements from the two tumors

4328 Cancer Res; 76(15) August 1, 2016

(Fig. 5B). These histograms show markedly higher frequencies of
low SO2 values in LS174T tumors. This is contrasted by PC3
tumors, showing extensive areas that did not produce sufﬁcient
PA signal, indicative of necrotic regions or dysfunctional vasculature. The histologic results were consistent among all tumors,
with quantitative analysis showing signiﬁcantly higher density of
large and open lumen vessels in LS174T tumors. Previous studies
have shown a positive correlation between the number of open
lumen and perfusion (21, 22). A proposed reason for increased
number of open lumen vessels was that there may be less compression from surrounding tumor cells.

Combined PA and DCEUS imaging enable distinction between
necrotic regions and blood lakes
The last aspect of the spatial correlation between DCEUS and
PA imaging presented in this study is the ability to distinguish
between necrotic regions and blood lakes. Both nonviable
tissue regions and blood lakes appear in DCEUS scans as
nonperfused regions. Comparison between perfusion maps and
PA-derived hemoglobin concentration estimations facilitate the
classiﬁcation of nonperfused areas into two categories: necrotic

regions and blood lakes. While necrotic regions include at most
sparse clusters of extravasated erythrocytes, blood lakes are
composed of large populations of red blood cells that have
escaped from leaky vessels. By using DCEUS in combination
with PA imaging the two tissue characteristics can be separated.
Nonperfused regions with high concentration of hemoglobin
would likely signify areas with blood lakes, while nonperfused
regions with low hemoglobin concentration would more likely
signify regions of necrosis. Furthermore, correlation between

perfusion and hemoglobin concentration can also help indicate
the presence of blood lakes verses necrotic tissue. In tissues
where substantial amount of blood lakes are present, correlation would likely be low, such as observed in LS174T tumors
(Fig. 2B). On the other hand, higher correlation between
perfusion and hemoglobin concentration would likely appear
in necrosis dominated tissue, such as PC3 tumors. Our observations were validated using histology, where large blood lakes
dominated LS174T tumors (Fig. 4C), while necrosis was signiﬁcantly higher in PC3 tumors (Fig. 4B).

the combination of DCEUS and PA are being developed and
the effect of improved PA resolution on the capabilities of these
multimodality scanners is a subject of future research. The
second limitation is that currently, DCEUS imaging using bolus
injections is limited to a single imaging plane. 3D ultrasound
probes have gained popularity in the past few years and the
combination of 3D DCEUS and 3D PA could decrease the
variability of the scans and enable the study of the 3D morphology of the vasculature.

Conclusions
Multimodality imaging facilitates functional assessment of
response to Oxi-4503 treatment
The ability of PA and DCEUS to facilitate functional assessment of response to Oxi-4503 treatment was examined;
Oxi-4503 was chosen for its well-researched effects of causing
tumor vessel collapse, leading to localized hypoxia, and eventually hypoxia-induced necrosis (23, 24).
DCEUS imaging was able to detect the perfusion changes in
the drug-treated group showing almost no microbubble signal
enhancement 4 hours after Oxi-4503 injection. The 80% decrease in both tumor blood volume and ﬂow rate indicators
was comparable with previous studies that demonstrated only
a small viable rim remains in the tumor after treatment with
Oxi-4503 (25). There were also, however, slight peak enhancement and wash-in rate changes observed in the control group.
These changes may have been a result of slight plane shifts, or
tumor orientation shifts between the two imaging time points.
We subsequently looked at CD31 staining of the tumor tissue
to validate our contrast ﬁndings. The histologic analysis showed a 50% decrease in the number of vessel per area in the Oxi4503 mice compared with the control. This level of microvessel
density change was slightly lower than our quantiﬁed contrast
change, which may be due to the fact that CD31 stains for all
existing endothelial cells, whereas DCEUS address functional
vasculature in real time.
Relative quantiﬁcation of SO2 was performed using reconstructed parametric maps of dual-wavelength PA imaging. We
were able to observe a noticeable decrease of around 40% in
tumor oxygenation with Oxi-4503–treated mice, whereas changes
were negligible in the control mice. Subsequent validation by
histology also showed 45% less hypoxia expression in the control
mice compared to Oxi-4503 treated. The presence of large viable
hypoxic regions 4 hours after the Oxi-4503 treatment is reasonable as some tissues can survive for more than 5 hours without
blood supply before undergoing necrosis (26).The histologic
ﬁndings in this study support PA ﬁndings of drug-induced
hypoxia.
Limitations and future research directions
There are two main limitations to the imaging methods
studied in this work. The ﬁrst is the limited resolution of
nontomographic PA imaging, both spatially and in separating
low SO2 values. New semitomographic methods that enable

In summary, DCEUS and PA produced high resolution maps
of perfusion and SO2 and hemoglobin concentration. These
physiologic parameters provide important information about
morphology and functionality of the vasculature feeding the
tumor and its microenvironment. In addition, the combination
of these two modalities enables the classiﬁcation of tumor area
to viable regions, necrotic tissue regions, and blood lakes. This
detection of blood lakes could aid in determining the leakiness
of the tumor. Furthermore, DCEUS and PA imaging were able
to monitor, with high sensitivity, known drug-induced changes
in the tumors, with close correlations to the current gold
standard histology measurements. These results were validated
quantitatively using histology. Taken together, our ﬁndings
strongly support that DCEUS and PA imaging could be effective
tools for the quantitative functional assessments of the microenvironment of various tumor models.
