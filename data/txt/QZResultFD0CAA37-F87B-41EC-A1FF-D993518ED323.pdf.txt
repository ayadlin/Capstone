ABSTRACT
Proteomic analysis identified differentially expressed proteins between zoledronic
acid-resistant and aggressive DU145R80 prostate cancer (PCa) cells and their parental
DU145 cells. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) showed a strong relationship between
the identified proteins within a network associated with cancer and with homogeneous
cellular functions prevalently related with regulation of cell organization, movement
and consistent with the smaller and reduced cell-cell contact morphology of DU145R80
cells. The identified proteins correlated in publically available human PCa genomic
data with increased tumor expression and aggressiveness. DU145R80 exhibit also
a clear increase of alpha-v-(`v) integrin, and of urokinase receptor (uPAR), both
included within the same network of the identified proteins. Interestingly, the actinrich structures localized at the cell periphery of DU145R80 cells are rich of Filamin A,
one of the identified proteins and uPAR which, in turn, co-localizes with `v-integrin,
in podosomes and/or invadopodia. Notably, the invasive feature of DU145R80 may be
prevented by blocking anti-`v antibody. Overall, we unveil a signaling network that
physically links the interior of the nucleus via the cytoskeleton to the extracellular
matrix and that could dictate PCa aggressiveness suggesting novel potential
prognostic markers and therapeutic targets for PCa patients.

resistance has led to the development and approval of
alternative novel hormonal agents such as abiraterone and
enzalutamide [2]. In addition, three other new agents have
recently been approved for the treatment of PCa, including
the first cancer vaccine Sipuleucil T, the chemotherapeutic
agent cabazitaxel, and the radiopharmaceutical
radium-223. However, despite continuing efforts in
developing novel therapeutic approaches, the overall
survival for castration-resistant metastatic disease remains
poor [2]. Hence, there is a need to better understand the
biology of the disease to develop more effective agents.
Current clinical strategies for evaluating prognosis
in PCa at the time of diagnosis include the determination
of anatomical extent, histologic grade (Gleason score) and

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly
diagnosed male cancer in the developed world [1] and a
leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality
in men worldwide. Although hormonal therapy controls
tumor growth for some time, patients eventually become
androgen refractory, leading to tumor progression and
metastasis, primarily to the bone. While the results of
chemotherapy using docetaxel are successful in some
patients with castration-resistant PCa (CRPC), others
develop chemoresistance, and clinical trials with secondline chemotherapy have been disappointing. Recently,

serum levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Although
these approaches are clear and important prognostic
factors to guide treatment in various clinical contexts, PCa
is a heterogeneous disease. Moreover, definitive molecular
markers that are able to predict prognosis are not known
at present. Thus, identifying the primary involvement
of specific pathways could maximize the benefit from
targeted therapies and help to define predictive biomarkers
in a context of an individualized treatment approach.
Dysregulation of proteins involved in cytoskeleton
organization and/or facilitating binding to extracellular
matrix has been associated with an increase of cell
ability to spread and the acquisition of resistance to
antitumor treatments in several tumors, including
prostate cancer [3].
Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (N-BPs),
such as zoledronic acid (ZOL), inhibit osteoclastmediated bone resorption and are used in clinical practice
to reduce skeletal complications and pain related with
bone metastasis of several neoplasms including PCa [4].
Accumulating evidence in both preclinical and clinical
studies indicate that ZOL might have also an anticancer
activity [5–7].
We have recently selected for the first time a ZOLresistant PCa cell line DU145R80 that exhibits a more
aggressive phenotype with increased invasive capability
and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) compared
to parental DU145 cells [8].
In the present study, to further investigate the
mechanism by which cells acquire ZOL-resistance
and invasive capability, we took advantage of the
highly sensitive two-dimensional differential in gel
electrophoresis (2-DE DIGE) to compare cellular
extracts from DU145R80 and DU145 cell lines. Applying
2-DE DIGE with dedicated software analysis and
successive liquid chromatography (LC)-tandem mass
spectrometry (MS/MS) allowed the identification of
several differentially expressed proteins. Pathway analysis
of experimental data emphasized relevant networks
that physically link the interior of the nucleus via the
cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. Accordingly,
the majority of the identified differentially expressed
proteins are involved in the regulation of cell organization
and movement and are consistent with the smaller and
reduced cell-cell contact morphology of DU145R80 cells,
most likely reflecting the reorganization of the F-actin
cytoskeleton. DU145R80 exhibit also a clear increase
of alpha-v-(αv) containing integrins, and of urokinase
receptor (uPAR), both included within the same network
of the identified proteins. Co-localization and additional
functional experiments confirmed that, unlike DU145
cells, DU145R80 cells display actin-rich structures
localized at the cell periphery where αv-integrin activation,
probably through uPAR, triggers the acquisition of an
invasive phenotype. Interestingly, by analyzing publically
available cancer microarray datasets, we also found that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

all the identified protein alterations were associated with
PCa compared to normal prostate tissue and were also
correlated with aggressive PCa.

RESULTS
Comparative proteomic analysis of DU145 and
ZOL-resistant derived subline DU145R80
DU145R80 were selected from DU145 cells by
stepwise exposure to increasing concentrations of ZOL and
showed the acquisition of a more aggressive phenotype
compared with parental cells [8]. To characterize proteins
putatively involved in the resistance to ZOL and in the
increased aggressiveness, we analyzed protein expression
from DU145R80 and DU145 cell lines after 48 h of cell
culture by a 2-DE DIGE proteomics approach. A scheme
of the procedure is shown in supplemental Figure S1. In
detail, for each condition, biological replicates (performed
in quadruplicate) were obtained and reverse-labeled by the
fluorescent cyanine dyes Cy3 and Cy5. For the internal
standard, which is generated from an equal combination
of all the samples tested in the same experiment, the Cy2
dye was used, leading to a proper quantitative comparison
of proteomic variations with statistical confidence. In
total, approximately 1,200 protein spots were constantly
detected in each gel, quantified, normalized and inter-gelmatched. To examine the differences existing between
the DU145R80 and DU145 cell lines and to corroborate
the biological validity of the biological variation results,
acquired data were processed in an unsupervised manner
using different multivariate analysis methods according to
the DeCyder 2D 7.1 EDA module. Protein spots included
in the analysis were those present in 80% of the spot maps
and with expression variation of at least ± 1.4-fold at the
95th confidence level (Student’s t test p < 0.05). Principal
component analysis (PCA) showed distinct expression
profiles between DU145R80 and DU145 cell lines as
well as a consistent reproducibility between the biological
quadruplicates (Figure 1A). According to our statistics, 21
spots detected were differentially expressed in DU145R80
compared to DU145 (Figure 1B).
LC-MS/MS was applied for protein identification,
and 15 of the 21 protein spots whose levels changed
were successfully identified (9 up-regulated and 6 downregulated in DU145R80 compared with DU145). For
each identification, the MASCOT search results are
detailed in Table 1 as follows: number of experimentalmeasured peptide masses matching the theoretical ones
obtained from Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL entries, percentage
of the protein sequence covered by the matching peptides
and probabilistic score. In Table 1, proteins were
also specified by fold change and numbers (spot no.),
correlating to corresponding spots in Figure 1B. The
identified proteins were classified, according to their

expression between DU145R80 and DU145 cells lines,
1-D and 2-D immunoblotting analyses were performed.
Proteins with identified expression changes were selected
for immunoblotting according to their known or supposed
correlation with PCa or with drug resistance based on
available literature, and at least one protein for each
functional class was analyzed (Figures1D and 2). Western
blotting analyses confirmed the 2-DE DIGE findings
reported in Figure 1D and 2A-F as spot quantification and
as standard abundance.
ALDH7A1 validation was performed by both 1-D
and 2-D Western blotting (Figure 1D). Interestingly, 2-D
immunoblotting highlighted the up-regulation of three
different isoforms of the protein, most likely derived by
different splicing sites (http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/
P49419), although we cannot exclude the possibility that
they may represent post-translational modifications of
the protein. LMNA/C antibody recognized two isoforms:
Lamin C and Lamin A, which differ for 6 amino acids at
the C terminus. A clear up-regulation was observed only
for the isoform protein species A (Figure 2A).
Those proteins validated by immunoblotting were
also evaluated for mRNA expression (Figure S2). A clear
correlation between protein and mRNA expression was
demonstrated only for FLNA, ANXA1 and ALDH7A1.
Conversely, PSMA6, eEF1γ, and LMNA mRNA
expression apparently are not modulated. LMNB2
mRNA expression was down-regulated while its protein
expression was clearly up-regulated in DU145R80
cells compared to DU145. The discrepancy between
mRNA and protein expression could indicate either
post-transcriptional modulation of those proteins and/or
the activation of a feedback inhibitory loop on mRNA
expression secondary to protein regulation.

identified differentially expressed proteins (Figure S3B).
Notably, the oncogene c-myc, which was one of the hubs
in the built network (Figure S3B), is overexpressed in
DU145R80 compared to DU145 cells and correlates with
the acquisition of an invasive phenotype [8]. Cancer was
confirmed as the IPA-predicted top altered disorder, while
the IPA-predicted top biological functions of the identified
proteins were “Cell morphology”, “Cell-To-Cell Signaling
and Interaction”, “Cellular Assembly and Organization
and Cellular Movement” (Table 2).
The molecular and cellular functions of the identified
proteins prompted us to characterize the morphology
of DU145R80 compared to DU145 cells. As shown in
Figure 3A, DU145 and DU145R80 cell lines show a
completely different morphology. DU145 cells exhibit an
epithelial, flattened morphology with a circumferential
margin closely adherent along their lateral and apical
surfaces. In contrast, DU145R80 cells assume a smaller,
rounded morphology and reduced cell-cell contact, in
agreement with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) feature of this cell line [8]. These changes in
cell morphology reflect the reorganization of the F-actin
cytoskeleton of DU145R80 cells with the appearance of
condensed actin-rich structures, consisting of membranebound ‘ring’ domains localized at the cell periphery
resembling podosomes/invadopodia (Figure 3B). Among
cytoskeleton regulating proteins, FLNA is a major actin
crosslinking protein and signaling scaffold with important
roles in regulating cell migration. Thus, we analyzed
the intracellular distributions of FLNA in DU145 and
DU145R80 cell lines. As shown in Figure  3B, FLNA
appears dispersed in the cytoplasm of DU145 cells,
apparently more concentrated in the nuclei and rarely
co-localized with actin filaments. Conversely, FLNA is
less dispersed in the cytoplasm of DU145R80 cells and
clearly co-localizes with actin-rich structures resembling
podosomes and/or invadopodia (Figure 3B). FLNA links
the peripheral actin cytoskeleton to integrins [9], which
represent a critical functional link between cytoskeleton
reorganization and the extracellular matrix. Recent studies
have shown that αv-containing integrins are functionally
involved in the maintenance of a highly migratory and
mesenchymal cellular phenotype in human PCa cells.
Furthermore, we and others have previously documented
that: i) αv-integrin activity is tightly modulated by uPAR
which promotes cell migration by interacting with the
α chain of αv-integrins [10]; ii) uPAR overexpression
in human PCa is associated with metastatic disease and
poor prognosis [11]. Accordingly with their pivotal role
in determining the acquisition of an invasive phenotype,
DU145R80 cells exhibit a clear-cut increase in both
αv-integrin and uPAR expression levels compared to
DU145 cells (Figure 4A).
Interestingly, the actin-rich structures localized
at the cell periphery of DU145R80 cells are rich in

The biological functions of the identified proteins
and morphological analysis confirmed the
invasive phenotype of DU145R80 cells
To further characterize the biological functions
and the pathways involved in the regulation of the
identified fifteen differentially expressed proteins, we
used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. The first
analysis was obtained looking for both direct (proteins
that make physical contact with one another or induce
direct chemical modifications) and indirect interactions.
In this way, the most relevant associated network function
(score 28) was “Cancer” and included approximately 80%
of the identified proteins that closely cluster together,
corroborating the biological reliability of the 2-DE DIGEproduced data (Figure S3A). The second analysis included
only direct interactions between the identified proteins and

All together, these findings strongly support the
notion that, unlike DU145 cells, DU145R80 cells, as a
consequence of cytoskeleton re-organization, display
actin-rich structures localized at the cell periphery where
αv-integrin activation triggers the acquisition of an
invasive phenotype.

(Figure  4B). According to the immunoblotting data,
DU145 cells express low levels of uPAR and αv-integrin,
mostly localized along the entire cell surface (Figure 4A
and 4B).
Furthermore, in keeping with the previously
reported higher invasive ability of DU145R80 cells [8],
we found that DU145 and DU145R80 cells exhibit a low
and high ability to invade matrigel in the presence of FBS,
(159% and 312% of the basal cell invasion, respectively)
(Figure 4D). Interestingly, when anti-αv antibody was
added to the cell suspension, the capability of DU145 and
DU145R80 cells to cross matrigel became comparable,
indicating that αv-integrin is deeply involved in the
acquisition of an invasive phenotype by DU145R80 cells.
As shown in Figure 4D, cell exposure to anti-αv antibodies
causes 55% reduction of FBS-dependent DU145R80 cell
invasion while DU145 cell invasiveness was unchanged.

datasets for tumor mRNA expression compared to adjacent
non-tumor (or normal) tissues. Interestingly, as shown in
Table 3, the results indicated that a significant increase
in mRNA levels, expressed as fold change of cancer
vs normal, was observed for all the up-regulated and
validated proteins (ANXA1, ALDH7A1, LMNA, LMNB2,
eEF1γ and uPAR) and correlated also quite well with the
fold change of DU145R80 vs DU145 presented in Table 1
and reported also in Table 3. Similarly, significantly lower
mRNA expression of PMSA6 and FLNA, both downregulated in DU145R80 cells, was detected in prostate
tumor tissue vs normal tissue. PSMA6 and FLMNA downregulation also correlates well with poor Gleason score
(Figure S4 A-B). Of note, ANXA1 and uPAR as well as
LMNA and eEF1γ mRNA levels are upregulated in the
same datasets. Taken together, these data indicated that the
modulated proteins could participate in carcinogenesis of
prostate cancer and suggest that the expression of at least
some of them might correlate with prognosis.

as an attempt to better characterize an isogenic model
of DU145 PCa cells and their derived ZOL-resistant,
aggressive subline DU145R80, previously selected by our
group [8]. The unsupervised multivariate analyses using
PCA indicated a high reproducibility between sample
replicates and demonstrated distinct expression patterns
from the two experimental groups. In addition, the 2-DE
DIGE results are based on very stringent statistical
parameters and indeed by IPA analysis we demonstrated
a strong correlation among the MS identified proteins (up
80%) consistently corroborating the biological reliability
of our results. We identified 15 proteins differentially
expressed between the two cell lines, 7 of which were also
validated by Western blotting. The molecular and cellular
functions of the identified proteins were homogeneous and
prevalently related with regulation of cell morphology,
organization, movement or cell-to-cell interaction. Indeed,
although DU145R80 was derived from DU145 upon the
sole selection in ZOL [8] and the number of differentially
expressed proteins is small, phenotypic analysis confirmed
a strikingly different morphology between the two cell
lines. The smaller, rounded and reduced cell-cell contact
morphology of DU145R80 cells, most likely reflecting the
reorganization of the F-actin cytoskeleton, is consistent
with the identified differentially expressed proteins by this
cell line compared with the parental DU145 line and is
well correlated with their increased invasive capability and
EMT features we have described before [8]. Notably, the

modulation of the identified proteins also, correlated with
increased tumor expression and tumor aggressiveness in
publicly available prostate cancer genomic data.
In detail, the structural proteins (34% of the total
proteins identified) differentially expressed between the
two cell lines could be divided into proteins involved in
cytoskeleton organization (20%) and components of the
nuclear lamina (14%).
Among cytoskeleton regulating proteins downregulated in DU145R80 compared with DU145 cells,
FLNA couples cell cytoskeleton to extracellular matrix
and integrin receptor signaling by crosslinking actin
filaments and is considered a critical protein in cell
adhesion, spreading, and migration [9]. In addition,

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

FLNA acts as a scaffold for intracellular proteins involved
in signal transduction, interacting with more than
45  proteins with diverse functions [9]. The function of
FLNA in carcinogenesis and/or in cancer cell migration
and invasion is not fully understood. Interestingly, it has
been shown that FLNA down-regulation promotes matrix
metalloproteinase secretion [19], a mechanism that may
contribute to the association of FLNA down-regulation
and cancer. In this regard, we have previously reported
that the increased invasive capability of DU145R80 cells
was paralleled by the increase in MMP9 gene expression
and secretion in culture media [8], and we confirmed
DU145R80 cells exhibit higher FBS-dependent invasive
ability in matrigel compared to DU145 cells.

included 6 of the 7 validated proteins with direct and indirect relations (ANXA1, FLMNA, PSMA6, ALDH7A1, LMNA, LMNB2)
connected with both αv (ITGAV) and uPAR (PLAUR) proteins and localized to a specific cell compartment (all colored in orange).
Network proteins are visualized by proper symbols, which specify the functional nature of protein. Each node represents a protein and its
direct (represented by solid lines) and indirect (represented by dotted lines) association with other proteins. Proteins with no background
color were undetected in the study but have been inserted by IPA to produce a highly connected network.

Conversely, another study in PCa suggested that the
localization rather than the expression of FLNA is crucial
and that a substantial increase in cytoplasmic staining for
FLNA in PCa metastatic tissue suggests a role for FLNA
in PCa aggressiveness, likely involving cell migration
[20]. An unanticipated role of cytoskeletal proteins such
as FLNA in the nucleus has also been suggested by the
findings that FLNA interacts with androgen receptor (AR)
and suppresses AR transcriptional activity [20] and by a
recent report showing that FLNA plays a role in the repair
of a variety types of DNA damage and that lack of FLNA
increases cell sensitivity to DNA damage-based cancer
therapy [21]. Although from our confocal microscopy
experiment, we cannot perform a quantitative evaluation
of FLNA distribution between nucleus and cytoplasm,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

it is evident that in DU145 cells, FLNA aggregates are
apparently more concentrated in the nuclei, dispersed in
the cytoplasm and rarely co-localized with actin filaments,
while in DU145R80 cells FLNA appears to be mostly
localized in the numerous podosomes and/or invadopodia.
Invadopodia are ventral membrane protrusions through
which invasive cancer cells degrade the extracellular
matrix and it was shown that invadopodia are the sites
where lipid raft formation and trafficking occur [22].
Notably EMT induces a massive rearrangements of the
actin cytoskeleton as well as changes in cell-cell and
cell-ECM junctions and recently it was suggested that
EMT could provoke an assembly of podosomes and
invadopodia [23]. Furthermore, a proteomic study on
prostate needle biopsy specimens also found FLNA

markedly downregulated in PCa vs benign prostatic
hyperplasia (BPH) [24], whereas a gene expression
profiling study found low levels of endogenous FLNA
in advanced and aggressive PCa compared with benign
tissues [13] (Table 3 and Figure S4).
Several transmembrane and signaling molecules
have been reported to interact with FLNA including
integrins [9, 25]. In this regard, we found higher
expression levels of αv-integrin in DU145R80 compared
with DU145 cells, suggesting that it has a role in the
different phenotypes displayed by the two cell lines.
We have previously shown that uPAR/αvβ5 vitronectin
receptor interaction positively regulates tumor cell
migration and invasion in breast cancer cells [26]. In PCa
cells, uPAR interacts and activates αvβ3 integrin, leading
to cytoskeletal reorganization and increased cell motility
[27]. Thus, uPAR not only focuses urokinase-dependent
proteolytic activity at leading edge of invading cells but
also signals to cytoskeleton through formation of complex
multiprotein units containing integrins. Indeed we also
demonstrated the overexpression of uPAR, in DU145R80
compared to DU145. Notably, uPAR overexpression
has been also confirmed in PCa tissues [14] (Table 3).
Significantly, uPAR mostly co-localized with actin fibers
at the cell surface in DU145R80 cells. We could speculate
that in DU145R80 invadopodia-like structures, uPAR
ultimately impact on αv-integrin activation resulting
in the acquisition of a more aggressive phenotype. This
hypothesis is also suggested by our data demonstrating
that DU145 and DU145R80 cell ability to cross
matrigel became comparable upon exposure to blocking
αv antibodies. However, DU145 cell invasion was not
affected by anti-αv antibodies raising the possibility that

other signaling components may be involved. It could
be the case of the metalloproteases MMP-2 that are
overexpressed by DU145R80 compared to DU145 cells
[8] and have been shown to bind integrin αvβ3 [28].
Another critical structural protein we found
up-regulated in DU145R80 is ANXA1, a calciumbinding (‘annexing’) anti-inflammatory protein that acts
extracellularly as a strong inhibitor of eicosanoid synthesis
and phospholipase A2 and that has intracellular roles in
many diverse functions, such as membrane and vesicle
trafficking, exocytosis, phagocytosis, signal transduction,
proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis [29]. Altered
expression profiles, phosphorylation, subcellular
localization, and/or specific modulation of mitogenic
signals are all possible mechanisms by which ANXA1
protein could mediate its biological effects. However, the
exact mechanisms through which ANXA1 exerts some or
all of its effects, particularly in cancer, are still not clearly
understood. Indeed, several findings concerning its role
in tumorigenesis are controversial because its expression
is reduced in certain cancers, while it is increased
in others [30]. However, ANXA1 overexpression
is associated with metastasis and poor prognosis in
multiple malignancies, including prostate cancers [14,
31, 32] (Table 3). Furthermore, there is a growing body
of evidence indicating that ANXA1 may interact with
cytoskeletal proteins such as tubulin and actin and that
these interactions could be implicated in the mechanism
of migration and invasion [33, 34]. Interestingly, it was
shown that ANXA1 is a substrate of the EGFR tyrosine
kinase, that ANXA1 is required for EGFR trafficking and
that EGF-induced phosphorylation of ANXA1 triggers
its co-localization with F-actin in the lamellipodia [35].

We  have recently found that ANXA1 and F-actin
co-localize in DU145R80 but not in DU145 cells
(Petrella A, Pucci B, Milone M. R. and Budillon A,
unpublished data). Moreover, it was shown that the
regulatory action of cell surface or extracellular ANXA1
is mediated by signaling through formyl peptide receptors
(FPRs) [36–38]. Notably, FPRs form complete signaling
units with extracellular matrix proteins such as vitronectin
and with membrane receptors such as uPAR and integrins,
which stimulate actin filament assembly and reorganization
that are critical events underlying cell migration [39–41].
Finally, a novel function of ANXA1 as a potential
regulator of pathological angiogenesis was recently
unveiled by demonstrating that ANXA1 is a new target
of the p38-MAPK pathway and that ANXA1 regulates
endothelial cell migration in response to vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [42]. In this regard,
we have previously reported that activation of p38MAPK pathway has a critical role in the induction of
ZOL resistance, as well as in the acquisition of a more
aggressive and invasive phenotype demonstrated in
DU145R80 cells. Notably in the IPA network showed in
Figure 5, p38-MAPK is one of the main hubs.
We also found increased expression of two nuclear
lamin proteins, LMNA and LMNB2, in DU145R80
compared to DU145 cells. LMNA and LMNB2 belong
to the lamins, the major architectural proteins of the cell
nucleus, which are essential for determining global nuclear
organization, regulating the movement of macromolecules
into and out of the nucleus and also providing anchoring
sites for chromatin domains, particularly those that are
enriched in silenced genes. More recently, a growing
number of human diseases have been recognized that are
linked to defects in nuclear envelope-specific proteins.
Notably, some of these disorders revealed that the nuclear
envelope not only provides a foundation that defines
nuclear architecture as a whole but also has significant
roles in cytoplasmic organization and cytoskeletal
mechanics [43].
Although lamin proteins are often aberrantly
expressed or localized in tumors, the nature of lamin
function in cancer is still unclear. It was shown that LMNA
proteins are positively involved in the malignant behavior
of PCa; indeed the overexpression of LMNA resulted in
stimulation of cell growth, colony formation, migration
and invasion in the PCa cell lines LNCaP, DU145, and
PC3 [44]. Overexpression of both LMNA and LMNB2
was reported in PCa tissues [17, 18] (Table 3). Moreover,
the presence of lamin isoform A is related to increased
invasiveness and EMT by indirect down-regulation of
E-cadherin [45].
Among other proteins differentially expressed
between DU145R80 and DU145 cells, 6% were involved
in protein fate, 40% were involved in RNA processing
and 20% were involved in the regulation of metabolism.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Some  of these proteins were described as aberrantly
expressed in cancer cells, associated with tumorigenesis
and/or with bad prognosis in several cancer types
including PCa [15, 16, 18] (Table 3). Among the
validated proteins, PSMA6, down-regulated in
DUR145R80 compared with DU145, is a very large 2.4
KDa ATP-dependent proteolytic complex that is found
in the cytoplasm and nucleus of eukaryotic cells. Of
note many proteasome substrates are known mediators
of pathways that are dysregulated with neoplasia [46].
The eEF1γ, upregulated in DU145R80, physically
interacts with the RNA polymerase II (pol II) core
subunit 3 (RPB3), both in isolation and in the context
of the holoenzyme. Importantly, eEF1γ has recently
been shown to bind vimentin promoter, and depletion
of eEF1γ causes the vimentin protein to be incorrectly
compartmentalized and to severely compromise cellular
shape and mitochondria localization [47]. According
to these observations, eEF1γ overexpression might, at
least in part, explain the up-regulation of vimentin we
have previous observed in DU145R80 [8]. ALDH7A1,
up-regulated in DU145R80, is known as an enzyme
involved in the detoxification of aldehydes generated
by alcohol metabolism and lipid peroxidation, but has
been also recently shown to be functionally involved
in PCa bone metastasis [48]. Interestingly, the altered
expression of both PSMA6 and of eEF1γ in DU14R80
can in turn affect post-trascriptionally (regulating protein
degradation or protein translation, respectively) the
expression of the other proteins, thus explaining some
discrepancy between mRNA and protein expression
(Figure S2).
In conclusion, we unveil a signaling network
that physically links the interior of the nucleus via the
cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix and that could link
changes in the cytoskeleton dynamics with altered protein
expression and dictate PCa aggressiveness. This network
is highlighted by the IPA analysis reported in Figure 5 that
included 6 of the 7 validated proteins connected with both
αv and uPAR, and localized to a specific cell compartment.
This signaling network is therapeutically relevant
for cancer but potentially also for other disorders. Indeed,
although cancer was confirmed as the IPA-predicted top
altered disorder, also connective tissue and hereditary
disorders involved a large number of the identified proteins
(Table 3). For example loss of function of FLNA has been
associated with a wide spectrum of connective tissue
and vascular abnormalities [49], glucocorticoid-induced
ANXA1 induction has been recently related with immunemediated inflammation and the pathogenesis of reumathoid
artritis [50], laminA recently has been correlated with
immune cell functions [51], while both A and B type
lamin mutations and/or defects in their expression or posttranslational processing, cause a heterogeneous group of
diseases known as laminopathies [52].

Overall, on the basis of our findings, we highlighted
novel candidate markers that could identify aggressive
PCa phenotypes, that be used to monitor anticancer
therapy in PCa patients, and/or that represent novel
targets for advanced PCa stage therapy and for preventing/
overcoming the acquisition of resistance to ZOL treatment.

The experimental design using the three-dye approach is
illustrated in Supplementary Table S1. Briefly, 50 μg of IS
containing an equal amount of sample proteins was labeled
with 400 pmol Cy2, and the two 50 μg protein samples were
labeled with 400 pmol Cy3 or Cy5. Dye-swapping among
protein samples was conducted to avoid artifacts due to
preferential labeling. Protein samples were kept on ice and
fluorescently labeled in the dark for 30 min. The reaction
was then quenched by the addition of 1 μl 10 mM l-lysine
(GE Healthcare) and the samples were kept on ice in the
dark for 10min.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Cell lines
Cell line DU145, derived from prostate cell line
models, was purchased from American Type Culture
Collections (Rockville, MD, USA). ZOL-resistant
DU145R80 cells were obtained as previously described
[8]. Both cell lines were cultured as previously
described [8].

2-DE DIGE
Isoelectrofocusing (IEF) was carried out on
preformed immobilized non-linear pH 3–10 gradient
gels of 24 cm length using an Ettan IPGphor system.
In detail, Cy2-, Cy3-, or Cy5-labeled proteins (50 μg
each) were pooled and added to the rehydration buffer to
obtain a final volume of 450 μL (8 M urea, 4% chaps,
1% Pharmalytes, 1% DTT, 0.01% bromophenol blue).
The buffer was then added to the strip and left for 16 h
at RT to ensure a complete rehydration. The IEF run was
performed according to the following electrical conditions
at 20°C and 50 μA/strip in the dark. Step 1: step and hold
100 V for 4 h; step 2: gradient 1000 V for 6 h; step 3:
gradient 8000 V for 3 h; step 4: step and hold 8000 V
for 4.40 h. After IEF, 1st dimension strips were subjected
to two equilibration steps: 15 min in 6 M urea, 2% w/v
SDS, 2% w/v DTT, 3% v/v glycerol, and 0.05 MTris-HCL
pH 6.8 followed by 15 min in 6 M urea, 2% w/v SDS,
2.5% w/v iodoacetamide, 30% v/v glycerol, 0.05 M
Tris-HCL pH 6.8, and 0.01% bromophenol blue. The
2nd dimension was then performed on 12% SDS-PAGE
homogenous polyacrylamide gels (24 cm × 20 cm ×
1 mm) using the EttanDalt Twelve Separation Unit. Gels
were cast between low fluorescent Pyrex glass plates (GE
Healthcare) to minimize background fluorescence during
scanning. Electrophoresis was performed as follows. Gels
were run in the dark at 23°C according to the following
power steps: 2 W/gel for 30 min followed by 17 W/gel for
4 h, or until the dye front reached the bottom of the gel.

Protein preparation and labeling with
DIGE dyes
All 2-DE DIGE reagents and instruments were
provided by GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburgh,
USA. Proteomic experiments were performed as described
by Bianchi et al. [53] with some modifications. The
experimental methodology used for 2-DE DIGE analysis
and protein identification is shown in Supplementary Figure
S1. Briefly, a biological quadruplicate (four independent
biological conditions) were used to give statistic confidence
to 2-DE DIGE data. DU145 (1 × 106 cells) and DU145R80
(1.5 × 106 cells) were seeded on 100-mm tissue culture
plastic dishes. Cells were collected using 1X PBS,
washed twice with PBS containing 250 mM sucrose and
stored at -80°C until use. Each sample was lysed in 8 M
urea, 4% chaps and 40 mM DTT. After 3 h of shaking at
RT, the samples were sonicated with ultrasonic waves
(amplitude 80 %, pulse 20 for 6 sec three times) on ice.
Protein concentration was evaluated by Bradford method
assay [54]. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used
as the standard for the calibration curve. Proteins were
precipitated using the 2-D Clean-Up Kit (GE Healthcare)
to remove additional salts according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Minimal protein labeling for 2-DE DIGE was
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(CyDye DIGE fluor minimal dye). Briefly, after
precipitation, proteins from DU145 and DU145R80 were
resuspended in 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% w/v chaps and
25 mM Tris and then buffered to between 8–9 pH . Protein
concentration was estimated by the Bradford assay as
described before. After quantification, the protein samples
were labeled using the fluorescent CyDyes™ (Cy2, Cy3,
and Cy5) developed for DIGE (GE Healthcare). Gel-to-gel
variation was controlled by using an internal standard (IS)
sample obtained by mixing equal amounts of proteins from
all the analyzed samples and labeled with Cy2 minimal dye.

2-DE DIGE image acquisition, analysis, 
and processing
Fluorescence signals were imaged by Typhoon Trio
laser densitometer recording band-pass filtered emission
wavelengths of 520 nm (Cy2), 580 nm (Cy3), and
670 nm (Cy5). Gels were scanned at 100 μm resolution
and the photomultiplier tube voltage was set to values
ranging between 500 and 700 V to ensure pixel intensity
maxima between 50,000 and 80,000 pixels for the three
dyes. Spot identification, background elimination, point
matching, and differential analysis of the protein

spots were completed using a 2D DeCyder software
(Differential In-Gel Analysis and Biological Variance
Analysis software module; V7.1, GE Healthcare). Each
gel image was processed in the Differential In-gel
Analysis (DIA) module of DeCyder prior to export to
the Biological Variation Analysis (BVA). In DIA, spot
detection was performed based on an estimated 10,000
spots. Background subtraction and in-gel normalization
processes were carried out automatically by the software.
The DIA workspaces were imported into BVA for manual
spot matching to the master gel. This BVA was also
employed to calculate mean average ratios and statistical
analysis between groups. The Student’s t-test was used to
calculate significant differences in the relative abundance
of individual protein spot features between two groups in
the 2-DE DIGE analysis. All missing values were treated
as absent rather than given a value of zero. Only the spots
found to be statistically significant ( p ≤ 0.05) and ratio ≥
or ≤ 1.4 were isolated for further investigation. These two
processes were performed automatically using the Batch
Processor Module, and the final result is a list that contains
the proteins differentially expressed between the two
groups analyzed. These proteins will be picked from the
preparative gels as described below. Multivariate analysis
was performed to assess global changes in DU145R80
compared to DU145. The DeCyder EDA (Extended
Data Analysis, V7.1) module was used for the principal
component analysis (PCA) that eliminates redundant
variables and reduces data complexity.

coordinates of the spots given by DeCyder were acquired
and used by an Ettan Spot Picker robot instrument to pick
spots from preparative gels and then identified the spots by
mass spectrometry. Selected protein spots stained by Deep
Purple and excised from the gel were washed in 50 mM
ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.0 in 50% acetonitrile to a
complete destaining. The gel pieces were re-suspended in
50 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.0 containing 100 ng
of trypsin and incubated for 2 h at 4°C and overnight
at 37°C. The supernatant containing the resulting
peptide mixtures was removed and the gel pieces were­
re-extracted with acetonitrile. The two fractions were then
collected and freeze-dried. The peptide mixtures were
analyzed by LC-MS/MS using the LC/MSD Trap XCT
Ultra (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) equipped
with a 1100 HPLC system and a chip cube (Agilent
Technologies). After loading, the peptide mixture (7 μl
in 0.2% HCOOH) was first concentrated at 4 μl/min in
a 40 nl enrichment column (Agilent Technologies chip),
with 0.1% formic acid as the eluent. The sample was then
fractionated on a C18 reverse-phase capillary column
(75 μm × 43 mm in the Agilent Technologies chip) at a
flow rate of 300 μl/min, with a linear gradient of eluent B
(0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) in A (0.1% formic acid)
from 7 to 50% in 35 min. Elution was monitored on the
mass spectrometers without any splitting device. Peptide
analysis was performed using data-dependent acquisition
of one MS scan (m/z range from 400 to 2000) followed
by MS/MS scans of the three most abundant ions in each
MS scan. Dynamic exclusion was used to acquire a more
complete survey of the peptides by automatic recognition
and temporary exclusion (2 min) of ions from which
definitive mass spectral data had previously been acquired.
Moreover, a permanent exclusion list of the most frequent
peptide contaminants (keratins and trypsin peptides) was
included in the acquisition method to focus the analyses
of significant data. Mass spectral data obtained from
the LC-MS/MS analyses were used to search a nonredundant protein database using an in-house version
of the MASCOT (Matrix Science, Boston, MA, USA)
software. Peptide mass values and sequence information
from LC-MS/MS experiments were used in the MS/MS
ion search taking into account the carbamidomethyl-Cys
as a fixed modification, oxidation of methionine as a
possible modification, a number of missed cleavages of
1 and precursor ion and fragment ion mass tolerances of
± 600 ppm and 0.6 Da, respectively.

Protein identification
Protein extracts were separated onto preparative
gels, and then proteins of interest were recovered from
the gels for identification. Proteins (about 500 μg) from
four sample groups were resolved on separate preparative
polyacrylamide gels and were visualized by staining
with Deep Purple Total Protein Stain according to the
manufacturer’s instruction (GE Healthcare). In detail,
the gels were fixed with a solution containing 7.5 %
acetic acid/10 % methanol, at RT with gentle agitation
overnight. The next day, the fixation solution was washed
out and replaced with washing solution (35 mM NaHCO3,
300 mM Na2CO3 in water) and shaken for 30 min at RT.
After removal of the washing solution, the gels were
stained with the Deep Purple solution (1:200 dilution
in distilled water) for 1 h at RT with gentle agitation
in the dark. The stain solution was then replaced with
7.5 % acetic acid and incubated at RT for 15 min (wash
solution). The gels were imaged at this stage by setting
the Typhoon scanner as described: excitation Green laser
(532 nm) and emission 560 LP or 610 BP filter. Once the
preparative gels were imaged, a match process was made
between these images and spot maps previously analyzed
by DeCyder 2D 7.1 software, with the aim being to find
the protein spots included in the list. In this way, the X/Y

the protein samples for the 2-DE DIGE study were
examined by 1-D or 2-D immunoblotting. In brief, 60

and transferred to a nitrocellulose membranes. For 2-D

were loaded on 7 cm length preformed immobilized nonlinear pH 3–10 gradient strips passively rehydrated using
125 μL rehydration buffer as described before. IEF was
performed according to the following electrical conditions
at 20°C and (50 uA/strip). Step1: step and hold 300 V for
0.01 h; step2: gradient 1000 V for 0.30 h; step3: gradient
5000 V for 1.30 h; step4: step and hold 5000 V for 3.06

electrophoretically transferred to a 0.45 μm nitrocellulose
membrane (GE Healthcare) in the Bio-Rad ElectroBlot
system as described for 1-D SDS-PAGE. Primary

immunoglobulins/HRP conjugate were from DakoCytomation (#P0217, 1:2000, Glostrup. Denmark), and
rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse IgG H&L HRP conjugate
(#ab6728, 1:2000) was from Abcam. Enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL) immunodetection reagents
were from GE Healthcare. The chemiluminescent signal
was detected with Image Quant LAS 500, and the
intensity was measured by ImageQuantTL image software
(GE Healthcare).

Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Cycle threshold
values (Ct) generated using Sequence Detection System
2.2.2 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA)
default parameters were exported to determine relative
mRNA abundances among genes in the classifier. All gene
expression levels were normalized to GUSB expression.
Each sample was tested in triplicate using RT-PCR and the
ABI Prism 7900 HT Sequence Detection System (Applied
Biosystems), and three independent experiments were
used to quantify relative gene expression.

Protein network analyses
The MS identified proteins which were confirmed
to change in expression were further analyzed by
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (GeneGo
Inc., St. Joseph, MI). IPA includes a manually annotated
database of protein interactions and metabolic reactions
obtained from the scientific literature. Gene names of all
the identified proteins and the corresponding mean fold
change values of the proteins were imported into IPA and
processed using the shortest path algorithm. Hypothetical
networks were built among the experimental proteins
and the IPA database proteins. The relevant pathway
maps were then prioritized according to their statistical
significance (p < 0.001), and networks were graphically
visualized as hubs (proteins) and edges (the relationship
between proteins).

Confocal microscopy
Cells (3 × 104 per sample) were allow to adhere on
glass coverslips at 37°C in humidified air with 5% CO2.
After 24 hours, slides were washed with PBS, fixed and
permeabilized with 2.5% formaldehyde-0.1% Triton
X-100 in PBS for 10 minutes at 4°C. After several washes
in PBS, slides were incubated with 10 μg/ml rabbit antiFLNA polyclonal Ab (Cell Signaling) or 2 μg/ml R4
anti-uPAR mAb for 60 min at 23°C and then exposed to
1:700 goat Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit IgG or goat Alexa
Fluor 488 anti-mouse IgG, respectively (Molecular Probes)
for 45 min at 23°C. To analyze cytoskeletal organization,
coverslips were subsequently incubated with 0.1 μg/ml
rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen) at 23°C for
45 min. For uPAR-αv double staining, slides were incubated
with 2 μg/ml anti-αv mAb (Chemicon, clone P3G8) and then
with 1:800 goat Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse IgG (Molecular
Probes) at 23°C for 60 and 45 minutes,  respectively.
Thereafter, 2 μg/ml R4 anti-uPARmAb and 1:800 diluted
rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 anti-mouse IgG (Molecular
Probes) were applied to slides at 23°C for 60 and 45 min,
respectively. In all cases, slides were mounted using 20%
(w/v) Mowiol, and cells were visualized with a 510 METALSM confocal microscopy (Carl Zeiss).

RNA isolation and quantitative RT-PCR assay
Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) was performed as
described by Milone et al. [8]. Briefly, Total RNA was
isolated using the RNeasy plus mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) as indicated by the manufacturer’s instructions
and quantified using a NanoVue Plus spectrophotometer
(GE Healthcare). Reverse transcription was performed
using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen).
Taqman probes were used to quantify RNA levels specific
for GUSB (GUSB_Hs00939627_m1), ALDH7A1
(Hs00609622_m1),
eEF1gamma
(eEf1gamma_

Clin ­Cancer Res. 2009; 15:788–796.

Invasion assays were performed in Boyden
chambers, using 8 μm pore size PVPF filters (Nucleopore)
coated with 50 μg/filter matrigel (BD Biosciences ) as
previously described [26]. Briefly, 3 × 104 viable cells
with/without 1:500 diluted blocking anti-αv monoclonal
antibody, clone 272-17E6, (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt,
Germany) or anti-Pan Akt (#MAB2055 R&D systems,
Inc, Minneapolis,MN) monoclonal antibody, the last used
as antibody negative control,were seeded in each upper
chamber in serum-free DMEM. The lower chamber was
filled with DMEM plus/minus 10% FBS as a source of
chemo-attractants. Cells were allowed to invade matrigel
for 18 hours at 37°C, 5% CO2. At the end of the assay,
cells on the lower filter surface were fixed with ethanol,
stained with haematoxylin and 10 random fields/filter
were counted at 200x magnification. The arbitrary value of
100% was given to the basal cell invasion, assessed in the
absence of serum. The experiments were performed three
times in duplicate, and the results, expressed as percentage
of the basal cell invasion.
