ABSTRACT
Here we showed that dietary NiCl2 in excess of 300 mg/kg caused the G2/M cell
cycle arrest and the reduction of cell proportion at S phase. The G2/M cell cycle arrest
was accompanied by up-regulation of phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia mutated
(p-ATM), p53, p-Chk1, p-Chk2, p21 protein expression and ATM, p53, p21, Chk1, Chk2
mRNA expression, and down-regulation of p-cdc25C, cdc2, cyclinB and proliferating
cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) protein expression and the cdc25, cdc2, cyclinB, PCNA
mRNA expression.

INTRODUCTION

and mitochondrial membrane depolarization leads to
caspase activation and DNA fragmentation which are the
hallmarks of apoptosis [15].
It is well known that cell cycle includes S (DNA
replication), M (nuclear division and cell division), G1 (the
cell-cycle gap phase between M phase and S phase), G2
(the cell-cycle gap phase between S phase and M phase)
phases, which is central to maintain homeostasis in the
multicellular organisms [16]. Loss of cell cycle control
may lead to imbalances in cell proliferation and cell
death that contribute to various disease states including
tumor formation [17, 18]. In response to various types of
DNA damages, the cell cycle regulatory molecules and
cell death signals are activated to stop cell growth and to
eliminate multiplication of genetically altered cells [19].
The G1 and G2 phases in the cell cycle play very important
roles as checkpoints in the regulation of cells proceeding
to S and M phases, respectively [19]. In damaged cells,
the cycle pauses longer in the G1 and G2 phases, which
provides more time for repair of DNA damage before
completing the next round of cell division. Prolonged cellcycle arrest can induce growth arrest or apoptosis [20-22].
Shiao et al. [23] report that Ni acetate can increase the
cell percentages in G2/M phase and apoptosis in Chinese
hamster ovary cells. Ma et al. [14] suggest that Ni NWs
significantly increase cell percentages in S phase in HeLa
cells, and our previous study suggests that NiCl2 induces
cell-cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phases in thymus [24].
Although there are some studies on cell-cycle arrest

Nickel (Ni) is a metal widely distributed in the
environment and is necessary for many industrial and
commercial uses [1-3]. As important materials in many
processes of modern industries, such as electroplating,
welding and alloy production, Ni and Ni compounds may
be released into the environment with relatively high
amounts at all stages of production, recycling and disposal
[4]. Also, Ni is a nutritionally essential trace metal for
several animal species, micro-organisms and plants, and
is a constituent of enzymes and proteins at low amount,
but Ni at higher concentrations is toxic and carcinogenic
to many organisms [1, 5, 6].
Epidemiological studies of Ni compounds from
occupationally exposed populations have accumulated
considerable evidences that exposure to both waterinsoluble and water-soluble Ni is associated with lung
and nasal cancers [7, 8], and Ni is therefore considered
as a carcinogen [4, 9]. Our own studies [10-13] have also
shown that dietary NiCl2 in excess of 300 mg/kg can
cause immunotoxicity, oxidative damage and apoptosis
in the kidney, spleen, small intestines and cecal tonsil
of broiler chickens. Interestingly, Ni nanowires (Ni
NWs) have been found to induce cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
in HeLa cells [14]. A novel Ni(II) thiosemicarbazone
complexes encourage ROS hyper-generation with
subsequent depletion of intracellular antioxidant pool,

induced by Ni- and Ni compounds, few reports focus on
the relationship between NiCl2 and cell cycle in the kidney.
Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate
how NiCl2 induced cell cycle arrest. The commercial
broilers’ growth cycle is about 42 days, and then they will
be put into use for consumption. In this period they grow
rapidly and a lot of diet will be consumed, and broilers
will easily affected by diet containing metal pollutants
(such as Ni). The aim of our study is to evaluate the effect
of dietary NiCl2 on the broilers in the period of growth. At
14, 28 and 42 days of the experiment, we monitored the
cell cycle arrest in the kidney of broiler chickens fed on
diets supplemented with various amounts of NiCl2. The
protein expression of phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia
mutated (p-ATM), p53, p-Chk1, p-Chk2, p21 p-cdc25C,
cdc2, cyclin B and proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA) protein expression and the mRNA expression

p53, p21, Chk1, Chk2, cdc25, cdc2, cyclin B, PCNA were
detected.

in cells at other stages of the cell cycle.
The cell percentages in G0/G1 phase were
significantly decreased (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) in the 900
mg/kg groups at 42 days of age when compared with those
in the control group. The cell percentages in G2/M phase
were significantly increased (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) in the
600 and 900 mg/kg groups from 14 to 42 days of age and
in the 300 mg/kg groups at 42 days of age in comparison
with those in the control group. The cell percentages in S
phase were significantly lower (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) in
the 600 and 900 mg/kg groups at 28 days of age and in the
three NiCl2-treated groups at 42 days of age than those in
the control group.

Changes of the cell cycle regulatory molecule
protein expression in the kidney
The changes of G2/M cell cycle regulatory molecule
protein expression are shown in Figures 3, 4, 5, 6.
The p-ATM and p53 protein expression was
significantly increased (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) in the 600
mg/kg and 900 mg/kg groups at 14 days of age and in the
three NiCl2-treated groups from 28 to 42 days of age when
compared with those in the control group. The p21 protein
expression was significantly higher (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01)
in the 600 mg/kg and 900 mg/kg groups from 14 to 42
days of age than those in the control group. The p-Chk1
protein expression was significantly increased (P < 0.05

DISCUSSION

Our results are consistent with the report of Shiao
et al. [23] that nickel acetate increases the cell proportion
in G2/M phase and decreases the cell proportion in S
phase in the Chinese hamster ovary cells. The reduction
of cell percentages in S phase found in this study is
also in agreement with the results that Ni(II)-containing
media reduce cell percentages in S phase in murine L-929
fibroblasts, human gingival fibroblasts and human tissue
mast cells [26]. However, there also is a report that Ni
NWs increase cell percentages in S phase in HeLa cells
[14].

This study shows the molecular control pathways of
dietary NiCl2-induced the cell cycle arrest in the kidney of
broiler chickens. We find consistent evidence that dietary
NiCl2 in excess of 300 mg/kg has adverse effects on the
renal cells. It induces cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase,
which results in cell-growth arrest or apoptosis when
damaged cells can’t be repaired [25]. Diets containing
NiCl2 also decreased cell percentages in S phase. (Figures
1 and 2)

In order to define how dietary NiCl2 induced G2/M
cell cycle arrest in the kidney, we measured G2/M phase
cell cycle regulatory molecules. The results showed
that NiCl2 increased the p-ATM, p-Chk1, p-Chk2 and
p53 protein expression, and ATM, Chk1, Chk2 and p53
mRNA expression (Figure 5 and 7). Salnikow et al. [27]
have reported that NiCl2 and nickel sulfide (Ni3S2) can
elevate the levels of p53 protein in human lung cell. There
is a similar result that NiCl2 increases p53 protein levels
in MCF-7 and A549 cells [28]. The central position of
ATM in the maintenance of genomic stability becomes
apparent by its involvement in checkpoint regulation

at the G2/M transition [29, 30]. From the results in the
present study, it is certain that NiCl2 activates the ATM
signal transduction pathways by up-regulation of ATM and
of its multiple downstream targets including Chk1, Chk2
and p53 [31, 32]. Further, NiCl2 induces G2/M phase arrest
via two different routes: the ATM-p53 and ATM-Chk1/
Chk2 pathways. These findings are similar to the report
that cadmium chloride (CdCl2) has been shown to cause
G2/M phase arrest in NRK-52E cells via elevation of p53
activity, up-regulation of cyclin kinase inhibitors p27 and
p21 expression, and down-regulation of cyclin-dependent
kinases Cdk1, Cdk2, cyclin A and cyclin B expression

MATERIALS AND METHODS

[33].

p53-dependent G2/M cell cycle arrest has also been
observed upon exposure to arsenic trioxide (ATO) and
CdCl2 in myeloma cells and rat renal proximal epithelial
cells [34]. Thus, p53 appears to be a critical mediator of at
least two or more cellular responses to a variety of DNA
damage: apoptosis, DNA repair and cell cycle arrest [35],
and p53-dependent G2/M cell cycle arrest is an important
component of the cellular response to stress [31, 36]. It
is also known that p53 can induce p21 up-regulation,
which causes cells to arrest in G2/M phase [37]. Our
results show that NiCl2 increases p21 protein and mRNA
expression, and decreases cyclin B, cdc2, PCNA protein
and mRNA expression. These results are consistent with
several studies that different stimuli can induce cell cycle
arrest through p53-dependent p21 activation [38-40].
Overall, p21 is known to induce cell cycle arrest at G2
by inhibiting cdc2 [41-43]. An inactive cdc2/cyclin B
complex does not allow cells to progress beyond the G2/M
cell-cycle checkpoint. At the same time, p21 inhibits DNA
replication and maintains G2/M cell cycle arrest through
the reduction of PCNA [37, 44-46]. The PCNA gene
product acts as an auxiliary factor for DNA polymerase
and stimulates DNA replication [47]. The limitation of
cdc2/cyclin B complex formation and the down-regulation
of PCNA expression block the passage of cells to mitosis
[48, 49]. The results obtained here are consistent with the
study that β-Mangostin can cause the p53-dependent G2/M
cell cycle arrest by down-regulating cdc2 and PCNA [50].
Concurrently, up-regulation of p-Chk1, p-Chk2
protein and Chk1, Chk2 mRNA expression indicates that
NiCl2 also activates ATM-Chk1/Chk2 pathways to inhibit
cdc2/cyclin B expression. The reduction of cdc2/cyclin
B complex induces G2/M cell cycle arrest. Joe et al. [51]
and Yoda et al. [52] have reported that ATO can increase
the protein expression of p-Chk1 and p-Chk2 in mice and
NB4, HL-6 cells. It has also been noted that Chk1 and
Chk2 are required for the initiation and maintenance of
DNA damage-induced G2/M cell cycle arrest [53, 54].
Further, Chk1 and Chk2 inhibit cdc2 via inactivating
cdc25, which can otherwise activate cdc2 trough the
phosphatase [55-57]. Our results show that NiCl2 reduces
the protein expression of p-cdc25C and the mRNA
expression of cdc25. And some studies have also shown
that Chk2 can induce G2/M cell cycle arrest through p53
up-regulation [54, 58].
In conclusion, dietary NiCl2 in excess of 300 mg/
kg causes the G2/M cell cycle arrest in the broilers kidney,
which is accompanied by the increase of ATM, p53, p21,
Chk1, Chk2 protein and mRNA expression, and decrease
of cdc25, cdc2, cyclin B, PCNA protein and mRNA
expression.

Experimental design
Two hundred and eighty one-day-old healthy
broilers were divided into four groups. There were seventy
broilers in each group. Broilers were housed in cages
with electrical heaters, and provided with water as well
as under-mentioned experimental diets ad libitum for 42
days.
To observe the time-dependent dynamic change,
we chose three time points (14, 28 and 42 days of age)
for examining cell cycle, and G2/M cell cycle regulatory
molecule protein expression and mRNA expression levels.
In this study, a corn-soybean basal diet formulated
by the National Research Council [59] was the control
diet. NiCl2 (NiCl2·6H2O, ChengDu Kelong Chemical Co.,
Ltd., Chengdu, China) was mixed into the corn-soybean
basal diet to produce the experimental diets containing
300, 600 and 900 mg/kg NiCl2, respectively.
The basis of doses (300, 600 and 900 mg/kg
NiCl2) selection: Ling and Leach reported that dietary
NiCl2 concentrations of 300 mg/kg and over resulted in
significant reduction in growth rate. Mortality and anemia
were observed in chicks receiving 1100 mg/kg nickel [6].
Weber and Reid found a significant growth reduction at
700 mg/kg NiSO4 and nickel acetate and over [60]. Chicks
fed on more than 250-300 mg/kg Ni in the diet exhibited
depressed growth and reduced feed intake [61]. Bersenyi
et al. [62] reported that supplementation of 500 mg/kg
NiCl2 reduced weight gain (by 10%), feed intake (by 4%)
and worse FCE (by 5%) in growing broiler cockerels.
According to the above-mentioned research results and
our preliminary experiment, we chose the doses of 300,
600 and 900mg/kg NiCl2 in this study for observing the
does-dependent changes.
Our experiments involving the use of broilers and all
experimental procedures were approved by Animal Care
and Use Committee, Sichuan Agricultural University.

Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry
At 14, 28, and 42 days of age, five broilers in each
group were taken for determination of the cell-cycle stages
in the kidney by flow cytometry.
The method of Cui et al. [63] was used and
performed as described by the original authors. Briefly,
the chickens in each subsample were humanely killed,
and their kidneys were immediately taken and ground to
form a cell suspension, which was filtered through a 300mesh nylon screen. The cells were washed twice with icecold phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH 7.2-7.4), and then
suspended in PBS at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/mL.
A total of 500 µL of the cell suspension was transferred

to a 5-mL culture tube. After centrifugation (600 rpm,
5 min), the supernatant was decanted, the cells were
incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark with
5 µL 0.25% Triton X-100 and 5 μL Propidium Iodide (PI)
(Cat. No.51-66211E). Finally, 500 μL of PBS were added
to each tube, and cells were analyzed by flow cytometry
(BD FACSCalibur) within 45 min of preparation. The
results were analyzed using the Mod Fit LT for Mac V3.0
computer program.

The kidneys from five chickens in each group were
taken at 14, 28, and 42 days of age and stored in liquid
nitrogen. They were then homogenized in liquid nitrogen
using a mortar and pestle.
As previously described [11], total RNA was
extracted from forzen kidney powders using RNAiso Plus
(9108/9109, Takara, Japan) following the manufacture’s
protocol. Next, cDNA was synthesized using a PrimScript™ RT reagent Kit (RR047A, Takara, Japan)
according to the manufacture’s protocol. The cDNA
product was used as a template for qRT-PCR analysis.
Sequences for target genes were obtained from the NCBI
database. Oligonucleotide primers were designed using
Primer 5 software and synthesized at Takara (Dalian,
China; Table 2).
All qRT-PCR were performed using the SYBR®
Premix Ex TaqTMⅡ system (DRR820A, Takara, Japan)
using on a Model C1000 Thermal Cycler (Bio Rad, USA).
Chicken β-actin expression was used as an internal
reference housekeeping gene. Gene expression values
from control group subsamples at 14, 28, and 42 days of
age were used to calibrate gene expression in subsamples
from corresponding experimental subsamples. All data
output from the qRT-PCR experiments were analyzed
using the 2-ΔΔCT method [64].

Determination of the cell cycle regulatory molecule
protein expression by immunohistochemistry
Five chickens in each group were humanely
sacrificed for gross examination at 14, 28 and 42
days of age. Kidneys were collected and fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde, dehydrated in ethanol and embedded
in paraffin.
The method was described by Wu et al. [11]. Kidney
slices were dewaxed in xylene, rehydrated through a
graded series of ethanol solutions, washed in distilled
water and PBS and endogenous peroxidase activity was
blocked by incubation with 3% H2O2 in methanol for
15 min. The sections were subjected to antigen retrieval
procedure by microwaving in 0.01 M sodium citrate
buffer pH 6.0. Additional washing in PBS was performed
before 30 min of incubation at 37 °C in 10% normal
goat serum (Boster, Wuhang, China). The slices were
incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibodies
(Table 1). After washing in PBS, the slices were exposed
to 1% biotinylated goat anti-rabbit/mouse IgG secondary
antibody (Boster, Wuhang, China) for 1 h at 37 °C,
and then incubated with strept avidin-biotin complex
(SABC; Boster, Wuhang, China) for 30 min at 37 °C. To
visualize the immunoreaction, sections were immersed in
diaminobenzidine hydrochloride (DAB; Boster, Wuhang,
China). The slices were monitored microscopically and
stopped by immersion in distilled water, as soon as brown
staining was visible. Slices were lightly counterstained
with hematoxylin, dehydrated in ethanol, cleared in xylene
and mounted.
The cell cycle checkpoint protein expression was
counted using a computer-supported imaging system
connected to a light microscope (OlympusAX70) with an
objective magnification of ×400. The mean intensity of
staining for each protein was quantified using Image-pro
Plus 5.1 (USA) as described previously. Each group was
measured five sections and each section was measured five
visions and averaged.

Statistical analysis
The significance of difference among four groups
was analyzed by variance analysis, and results presented
as mean ± standard deviation ( X ±SD). The variation was
measured by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test
