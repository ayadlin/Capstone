ABSTRACT
In the present study, we found that selective inhibition of histone deacetylase
2 (HDAC2) with small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) induced survivin downregulation in
a p53-dependent manner. Interestingly, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA)
or knockdown of HDAC2 induced downregulation of Mdm2, a negative regulator of
p53, at the protein level. SAHA and/or HDAC2 siRNA increased Mdm2 ubiquitination,
and MG132, an inhibitor of proteosome function, prevented HDAC2 inhibitioninduced degradation of Mdm2. Clinically, the mRNA levels of HDAC2 and survivin
were prominently overexpressed in lung cancer patients compared to normal lung
tissues. Silencing of HDAC2 enhanced the cell death caused by ionizing radiation in
lung cancer cells. Collectively, our results indicate that selective inhibition of HDAC2
causes survivin downregulation through activation of p53, which is mediated by
downregulation of Mdm2. They further suggest that HDAC2 may exert a dominant
effect on lung cancer cell survival by sustaining Mdm2-survivin levels.

INTRODUCTION

amino terminal tails of histone protein [1]. By controlling
the level of acetylation of core histones, HDACs are
generally associated with repression of transcription and
reduced gene expression [2]. In addition to interacting with
chromatin proteins, HDACs can lead to altered expression
of a large number of genes through direct interaction with
non-histone proteins, such as the transcription factors E2F
and Stat3, and the tumor-suppressor p53 [3, 4]. Several

Members of the histone deacetylase (HDAC)
family, encoded by 18 distinct genes, are divided into
four classes—class I, class IIa, class IIb, class III and
class IV—based on their homology. HDACs catalyze the
removal of acetyl groups from lysine residues located on

studies have shown that class I and II HDACs (HDAC110) are overexpressed in some cancers, including gastric
cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, and lung cancer
[5, 6]. Moreover, both altered expression and mutation
of HDACs have been linked to cancer formation and
progression, reflecting the fact that these changes in
HDACs induce aberrant transcription of key genes that
regulate important cellular functions [2]. In light of this,
class I and II HDACs have emerged as attractive targets for
anticancer therapy. In fact, two recently developed HDAC
inhibitors—vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic
acid (SAHA), Zolinza) and depsipeptide (romidepsin,
Istodax)—have been approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) as anticancer drugs [1, 7]. HDAC
inhibitors have been shown to induce apoptotic cell death
and growth arrest in various cancer cells, promote reactive
oxygen species generation, and inhibit angiogenesis
through downregulation of genes involved in regulating
angiogenesis, including hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha
(HIF1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
[8]. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) has been
shown to enhance radiosensitivity in preclinical tumor
models [9]. SAHA treatment in combination with ionizing
radiation has been reported to attenuate the upregulation
of DNA damage-repair proteins, including DNA-activated
protein kinase (DNA-PK) and the recombinase Rad51
[10]. Although HDAC inhibitors have been evaluated in
clinical trials, the different and specific roles of individual
HDACs in carcinogenesis remain unclear.
Survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis
family, is undetectable in most normal adult cells but
is frequently overexpressed in a variety of cancer cells.
It has been shown that survivin inhibits apoptosis,
promotes tumor-associated angiogenesis, and serves as a
determinant of resistance to various anticancer therapies
[11]. Survivin expression inhibits cell death induced
by various apoptotic stimuli in vitro and in vivo [12].
Notably, overexpression of survivin is detected in earlystage non-small-cell lung cancer patients, suggesting
that survivin may play a role in lung tumorigenesis [13].
It has also been reported that survivin gene expression
is transcriptionally repressed by wild-type p53, which
binds directly to the survivin promoter [14, 15]. As a
downstream factor that is highly expressed in cancer
and regulated by p53, survivin is a dual mediator of
resistance to apoptosis and cell-cycle progression [16].
Thus, regulation of the p53-survivin signaling pathway
is important for cell survival. We previously showed that
SAHA is a potential therapeutic agent by virtue of its
downregulation of survivin in lung cancer [17]. HDAC
inhibitors have been shown to induce cell death by
suppressing survivin expression in various cancer cells,
including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), renal cell
carcinoma and epidermoid carcinoma [18-22]. A better
understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the
regulation of survivin expression by specific members of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the HDAC subfamily and the role of p53 in this process
could provide a novel strategy for minimizing toxicity and
acquiring high efficacy through targeting of survivin.
In the present study, we investigated the role of
individual HDACs in regulating survivin expression. We
further explored possible molecular mechanism(s) by
which inhibition of HDAC2 negatively regulates survivin
expression and elucidated the relationship between
inhibition of HDAC2 and radiosensitivity in non-smallcell lung cancer cells. We found that inhibition of HDACs
with a chemical inhibitor or genetic knockdown of
HDAC2 downregulated survivin by increasing p53 protein
stability. Interestingly, the increase in p53 protein induced
by HDAC2 knockdown was mediated by proteosomal
degradation of the p53 negative regulator, Mdm2.
Together, these findings suggest that HDAC2 might be an
important molecular player in the regulation of Mdm2 and
survivin expression levels in lung cancer cells.

RESULTS
SAHA induces survivin downregulation through
p53 activation
In our previous report, we examined the effect
of SAHA on the expression of survivin in human nonsmall-cell lung cancer cells [17]. We found that SAHA
decreased the expression of survivin. Here, we confirmed
that SAHA induced a concentration-dependent decrease in
survivin levels in A549 cells; it also increased acetyl-p53,
p21, puma and acetyl-histone levels without expression
changes of HDACs (Fig. 1A). RT-PCR analyses showed
that survivin mRNA levels were also downregulated by
treatment with SAHA for 24 h (Fig. 1B). These results
suggest that SAHA regulates survivin expression at the
transcriptional level.
To further investigate whether p53 is associated
with SAHA-induced downregulation of survivin, we
examined survivin expression in p53 wild-type A549 cells
and p53-null H1299 cells after treatment with SAHA.
SAHA decreased survivin protein levels in A549 cells,
but did not affect survivin levels in H1299 cells (Fig. 1C).
Furthermore, knockdown of p53 with siRNA significantly
attenuated the reduction in survivin protein levels
induced by SAHA in A549 cells (Fig. 1D). In H1299
cells transfected with a p53 expression plasmid, SAHA
treatment resulted in downregulation of survivin (Fig. 1E).
We examined the level of survivin using Western blotting
in HCT116 colon cancer cell lines, p53(-/-) and p53(+/+)
after treatment with SAHA. In Fig.1F, basal survivin level
in p53(+/+) cell line are lower than p53(-/-) cell line. p53
expression was increased and survivin expression was
decreased by SAHA in p53(+/+) cell line, but SAHA did
not affect survivin levels in p53(-/-) cells. Transfection of

A549 p53-wild cells with a plasmid expressing the p53
C135Y mutant (C135Y) led to recovery survivin downregulation induced by SAHA (Fig. 1G). The p53 C135Y
expression plasmid encoding a dominant-negative mutant
can no longer interact with p53 binding sites because of a
conformational change induced by mutation of cysteine
135 to tyrosine [24]. Collectively, these results indicate the
p53 activation plays an important role in SAHA-induced
survivin downregulation.

mRNA levels, whereas SAHA or HDAC2 siRNA had no
effect on Mdm2 mRNA levels (Fig. 3E and 3F).
These results suggest that Mdm2 is downregulated
at the protein level by SAHA. To verify this, we examined
SAHA or HDAC2 siRNA effects on Mdm2 protein
expression in cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor,
MG132. As shown in Fig.4A and 4B, Mdm2 expression
levels were restored in cells co-treated with SAHA or
HDAC2 siRNA and MG132. Furthermore, ubiquitination
assays confirmed that Mdm2 was ubiquitinated after
treatment with SAHA and/or HDAC2 siRNA (Fig. 4C
and 4D). These results strongly suggest that inhibition of
HDAC2 induces p53-dependent survivin downregulation
through proteasome-mediated degradation of Mdm2.

Selective inhibition of HDAC2 induces survivin
downregulation
To identify the role of individual HDACs in survivin
expression, we transiently transfected A549 cells with
siRNA individually targeting the HDAC family members,
HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC4. Western blot
analyses showed that each selective siRNA specifically
decreased the protein level of its targeted HDAC.
Interestingly, we found that knockdown of HDAC2
changed survivin and p53 protein levels prominently (Fig.
2A).
Next, we tested the role of p53 in HDAC2 siRNAmediated downregulation of survivin in p53 wildtype A549 lung cancer cells. HDAC2 siRNA induced
an increase in p53 protein levels and corresponding
reduction in survivin protein levels dose-dependently as
well as survivin mRNA levels (Fig. 2B). When we used
two different HDAC2 siRNAs, the effect on survivin
was in same manner with Fig 2B. (Fig. 2C) Furthermore,
knockdown of p53 with siRNA significantly reversed the
HDAC2 siRNA-induced reduction in survivin protein
(Fig. 2D). These results indicate that HDAC2, among
HDAC isoforms, specifically plays a role on regulation
of survivin and p53 acts as a mediator of HDAC2
knockdown-induced survivin downregulation.

Correlation between HDAC2 and survivin
expression in lung cancer cell lines and
overexpression of HDAC2 and survivin in lung
cancer patients
To determine whether HDAC2 and survivin
expression are correlated in lung cancer cell lines, we
analyzed the expression of HDAC2 and survivin at the
protein level in A549, H460 and Lu99 cell lines (nonsmall lung cancer cell, p53 wild type). As shown in
Fig.5A, survivin expression levels in lung cancer cell
lines were highly correlated with HDAC2 expression
levels. SIRT1 and SIRT2 are classified to HDAC Class
III, and are not inhibited by SAHA. One of the nonhistone target of SIRT1, p53, is suggested to play a central
mediator of SIRT1-mediated functions in the process of
tumorigenesis and senescence. Furthermore, there are
new evidences that SIRT1 acts as a tumor suppressor
based on its role in negatively regulating beta-catenin and
survivin. [26] Therefore, we detected SIRT1 and 2 levels
as well as HDAC1-4 in lung cancer cell lines and then
confirmed that HDAC2 expression are related to survivin
regardless of SIRT1 and SIRT2. Comparison of HDAC2
and survivin mRNA expression levels between normal
and cancer were performed using TissueScan Cancer
Array (each containing cDNAs from 8 different normal
lung and 40 lung cancer patient tissues). In lung cancer
patients, survivin and HDAC2 mRNA expression were
overexpressed compared to normal lung tissues (Fig 5B).
These results indicate that expression of survivin may be
regulated by HDAC2 in lung cancer cells.

HDAC2 inhibition induces Mdm2 downregulation
through proteasomal degradation
To identify the molecular mechanism(s) underlying
the activation of p53 induced by SAHA or knockdown
of HDAC2, we investigated Mdm2 levels after treatment
with SAHA or siRNA targeting HDAC2 in A549 lung
cancer cells. Unexpectedly, we found that SAHA induced
a concentration-dependent decrease in Mdm2 protein
levels (Fig. 3A). In Fig. 3B, 3C and 3D, HDAC2 siRNA
similarly induced a marked, dose-dependent decrease
in Mdm2 levels; in contrast, siRNA targeting HDAC1
or -3 had no such an effect. To investigate the possible
mechanism responsible for SAHA-induced Mdm2
downregulation, we first performed RT-PCR to test the
expression of Mdm2 mRNA in SAHA or HDAC2 siRNAtreated cells. Nutlin-3A, used as positive control for
Mdm2 mRNA regulation [25], markedly increased Mdm2

Knockdown of HDAC2 enhances sensitivity to IRinduced cell death
Since IR can induce cell death in p53-dependent
manner [24, 27], we next determined whether HDAC2
siRNA enhanced the sensitivity of lung cancer cells to IRinduced cell death. As shown in Fig.6A, HDAC2 siRNA
markedly enhanced the sensitivity of cells to IR-induced

cytotoxicity. In colony-forming assays, HDAC2 siRNA
had a greater effect on IR sensitivity than negative control
siRNA (Fig. 6B). Fig.6C showed that cleavage of caspase
3/7 and PARP were more increased in cells treated with IR
and HDAC2 siRNA. These results suggest that antitumor
effect of HDAC2 targeting in lung cancer cells might be a
apoptotic cell death induced by DNA damage. To find the
combined effects of IR and HDAC2 siRNA treatment on
ATM/ATR signaling, we examined the levels of phosphoATM/ATR, -Chk1/2, and -γH2AX after treated with IR
or IR/HDAC2 siRNA by Western blotting. As shown in

Fig. 6D, the phosphorylation levels of Chk2 and γH2AX
were more increased in cells treated with IR and HDAC2
siRNA than those in IR alone treatment. These results
indicate that inhibition of HDAC2 by siRNA enhanced the
cytotoxicity which is consequences of the DNA damage
induced by IR in lung cancer cells. IR/HDAC2 siRNAinduced cell death was restored in cells transfected with
p53 siRNA or survivin overexpression plasmid. (Fig 6D,
6E) These results suggest that targeting HDAC2 could
be effective in the radiotherapy of non-small-cell lung
cancers harboring wild-type p53.

DISCUSSION

proteosomal degradation of Mdm2 induced by HDAC2
inhibition, we co-transfected H1299 cells with HDAC2
siRNA and expression constructs for p53 and an E3
ligase-deficient Mdm2 mutant. We found that Mdm2
was decreased by HDAC2 siRNA, suggesting that
Mdm2 self-ubiquitination is not involved in the Mdm2
downregulation induced by HDAC2 inhibition (Data
not shown). Thus, fully elucidating the regulation of p53
by HDAC will require additional studies to identify the
E3 ligase(s) responsible for Mdm2 degradation in this
pathway.
In this study, we found that expression levels of
survivin were significantly correlated with HDAC2
expression levels in p53 wild type lung cancer cell lines
although cases are not sufficient (Fig. 5A). And survivin
and HDAC2 expression levels are mostly overexpressed
in cancer patients compared to normal lung tissue (Fig.
5B). In this study, we suggest that not only survivin
downregulation plays an important role in HDAC2
inhibition-induced cell death, but targeting of the HDAC2
and survivin is the cancer selective treatment. Survivin
is rarely present in normal tissue or cells. Increased
expression of survivin and HDAC2 are detected in cancer
cells including lung cancer [13]. In addition, normal
cells are relatively resistant to HDAC inhibitor-induced
cell death [8]. HDAC inhibitor can alter the structure
and function of a broad range of proteins regulating cell
proliferation, migration, and death that are substrates of
HDACs. Cancer cells generally have multiple defects in
proteins regulating cell proliferation, cell migration, and
cell death. Thus, cancer cell may have less capacity to
compensate for the HDAC inhibitor effects than normal
cells [28].
In Fig. 6D, Chk2 phosphorylation is known to be
occurred by ATM dependent manner in response to IR
[Ref.2], however, phospho-Chk2 was more increased in
cells combination treated with IR and HDAC2 siRNA
than those in IR alone treatment, ATM-independently.
Therefore, selective depletion of HDAC2 would be
sufficient to potentiate Chk2 phosphorylation and
confer sensitivity to DNA damage. Although further
study is needed to identify the factor responsible for
phosphorylation of Chk2 induced by inhibition of HDAC2,
our study may provide insight into the mechanism by
which HDAC inhibitors potentiate radiotherapy and may
provide guidance in the further development of therapeutic
agents that more selectively inhibit HDAC2.
In conclusion, Fig. 6F depicts our proposed scheme
in which SAHA or HDAC2 siRNA treatment of lung
cancer cells results in Mdm2 downregulation and p53
activation, consequently downregulation of survivin.
Downregulation of survivin enhances the responsiveness
of the cells to ionizing radiation, then rendering the tumor
cells less resistant to ionizing radiation-induced cell death.

The potential role of HDAC inhibitors in
downregulating survivin expression has been described
previously [18-22]. SAHA, a reversible pan-inhibitor of
HDACs, inhibits class I (1, 2, 3 and 8) and II (4, 5, 6,
7, and 9) HDACs. Therefore, to identify which subfamily
of HDACs is (are) involved in regulation of survivin, we
tested several siRNAs against HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3
and HDAC4. The results (Fig.2 and Fig.3) show selective
depletion of HDAC2 dominantly mediated survivin and
MDM2 downregulation. Individual HDACs may play
distinct roles and contribute differently in cells. However,
they show massive over-compensation and share the link
in pathway. In particular, HDAC1 and HDAC2 show
compensatory and overlapping functions so that it is
complicated to indicate differing effects between specific
HDAC subsets [28]. In Fig. 3B, treatment of HDAC1
knockdown alone inhibited MDM2 to some extent. We
thought that it seems to be a compensatory action between
HDAC Class I. In this regards, various HDACs subfamily
directly or indirectly seems to affect on survivin and Mdm2
expression. In spite of such a compensation between
HDACs, siRNA of HDAC2 dominantly downregulates
survivin and Mdm2 expression compared with HDAC1
or HDAC3 siRNA. Moreover, p53 expression in protein
levels were most remarkably upregulated in cells treated
with HDAC2 siRNA other than those of HDACs siRNA.
These results suggest that suppression of HDAC2
specifically induced downregulation of survivin through
p53 activation in lung cancer cells.
Upon HDAC inhibition, p53 is stabilized and
acetylated at lysines 320, 373, and 382 [29, 30]. The
intracellular amount of p53 is primarily regulated by
the Mdm2 oncoprotein through a negative feedback
mechanism, whereby elevated levels of p53 stimulate
the expression of Mdm2, which in turn sequesters and
ubiquitinates p53, marking it for proteasomal degradation
and/or nuclear exclusion [31]. Thus, Mdm2, acting
primarily as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is a key regulator of
the p53 tumor suppressor, promoting its degradation and
also inhibiting its transcriptional activity by recruiting
histone deacetylase and corepressors to p53 [32]. In
this context, we examined the role of Mdm2 in the p53mediated downregulation of survivin induced by inhibition
of HDAC2. Interestingly, Mdm2 was downregulated
at the protein level by the HDAC inhibitor SAHA and
by siRNA targeting HDAC2 (Fig. 3). Consistently with
this, ubiquitination assays confirmed that Mdm2 was
ubiquitinated after treatment with SAHA and/or HDAC2
siRNA. These results indicate that downregulation
of Mdm2 by inhibition of HDAC2 occurred through
proteasome-mediated degradation of Mdm2 protein.
It is known that Mdm2 is capable of selfubiquitination through its E3 ligase function [33]. To
test whether self-ubiquitination was responsible for the

pairs (Origene Technologies, Rockville, MD, USA).
HDAC2 and survivin mRNA expression levels
in lung cancer patient tissue were analyzed using a
TissueScan Cancer Array from Origene Technologies,
according to the manufacturer’s protocols. In brief, after
aliquot 25 μL of the PCR pre-mix including β-actin or
HDAC2 specific primer pairs to each well (Tissue cDNAs
of each array are synthesized from high quality total RNAs
of pathologist-verified tissues), the thermocycling was
performed. The condition was followed: pre-soak 95 °C
for 10 min and 39 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 20 s.

Cell cultures and reagents
A549, H1299 and H460 human lung cancer cells
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA, USA), Lu99 human lung cancer cells,
purchased from the RIKEN cell bank (Tsukuba, Japan),
and HCT 116 colorectal cancer cells (p53 null and p53
wild) were supplied by Dr. Kee-Ho Lee (KIRAMS,
KOREA) were grown in the recommended growth
medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). SAHA
was purchased from ALEXIS Corporation (Lausen,
Switzerland). Antibodies against HDAC1, HDAC2,
HDAC3, cIAP2, Mdm2, HA, Myc and β-actin were
acquired from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA,
USA). HDAC4, SIRT1, SIRT2, histone 3, acetyl-histone
3, acetyl-histone 4, acetyl-p53 (Lys382), puma, ubiquitin,
caspase 3, cleaved PARP, p-ATM, ATM, p-ATR, ATR,
p-Chk1, Chk1, p-Chk2, Chk2, p-γH2AX, γH2AX and
survivin antibodies were acquired from Cell Signaling
Technology (Beverly, MA, USA). XIAP, caspase 7 and
p21 antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences
Pharmingen (San Diego, CA, USA), and the p53 antibody
was from Novocastra Lab. Ltd. (Newcastle, UK). The
Flag antibody, Nutlin-3A and MG132 were from Sigma.
(St Louis, MO, USA). The siRNAs targeting HDAC1,
HDAC2, HDAC3, or HDAC4 were from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. Two different HDAC2 siRNAs (siHDAC
#2 and siHDAC #3) and p53-specific siRNA were
purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX, USA).

Western blotting
Cells were harvested and lysed in RIPA buffer (50
mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P40,
0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) supplemented
with a protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche,
Mannheim, Germany). Equal amounts of protein (20-50
μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a
nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked by
incubating with 3% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline
(TBS) for 1 h and then were incubated overnight with the
appropriate primary antibodies (1000:1). Membranes were
then incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody
(3000:1) for 1 h. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized
using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham
Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK).

Measurement of cell viability

Transfections and treatments

Cell viability was determined by measuring the
mitochondrial conversion of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) to a colored
product. Cells were treated as indicated, and the medium
was exchanged with serum-free medium containing 1
mM MTT. After 2 h of incubation at 37°C, cells were
solubilized in DMSO. The amount of formazan, the
converted form of MTT, was determined by measuring
absorbance at 595 nm.

A549 cells in 1 ml of serum-free medium were
transfected with plasmid (0.1-0.2μg) or siRNA (50120 nM) for 4 h at 37°C in a CO2 incubator using
Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) as described by the
manufacturer. The media were then replaced with fresh
media containing 10% fetal bovine serum and cells were
incubated for an additional 2 h. After transfection, cells
were treated with SAHA and/or IR and analyzed as
described below. The cells were irradiated using a 137Cs
γ-ray source (Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., Canada).

Clonogenic assay

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR)

Cells were transfected with 60 nM siRNA and
incubated for 24 h. Transfected cells were seeded at a
concentration of 300-500 cells/60-mm dish. After 24 h,
cells were irradiated with different doses (1 or 2 Gy) of
IR (γ-irradiation). After culturing for 18 d, colonies were
stained using a Diff Quik kit (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan), and
the number of colonies greater than 2 mm in diameter
were counted. The surviving fraction was calculated by

Total RNA was isolated using a RNA mini kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). An aliquot of total RNA (2
μg) was transcribed into cDNA using an RT2 First Strand
kit (Qiagen). cDNA was amplified with Taq polymerase
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA) using the specific primer
