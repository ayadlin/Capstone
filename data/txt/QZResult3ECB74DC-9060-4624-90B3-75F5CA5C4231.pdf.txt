Abstract
The promise of retinoids as chemopreventive agents in breast
cancer is based on the differentiation and apoptosis induced
upon their binding to the retinoic acid (RA) receptor B (RARB).
We have previously shown that HOXA5 induces apoptosis in
breast cancer cells. In this study, we investigated whether RA/
RARB and HOXA5 actions intersect to induce apoptosis and
differentiation in breast cancer cells. We found that HOXA5
expression can be induced by RA only in RARB-positive breast
cancer cells. We have, for the first time, identified the RA
response element in HOXA5, which was found to be located in
the 3¶ end of the gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays
showed that RARB binds directly to this region in vivo.
Overexpression of RARb strongly enhances RA responsiveness,
and knocking down RARb expression abolishes RA-mediated
induction of HOXA5 expression in breast cancer cells. In
addition, there is coordinated loss of both HOXA5 and RARb
expression during neoplastic transformation and progression
in the breast epithelial cell model, MCF10A. Knockdown of
HOXA5 expression partially abrogates retinoid-induced apoptosis and promotes cell survival upon RA treatment. These
results strongly suggest that HOXA5 acts directly downstream
of RARb and may contribute to retinoid-induced anticancer
and chemopreventive effects. [Cancer Res 2007;67(17):8007–13]

Introduction
Retinoids, the natural and synthetic derivatives of vitamin A,
exert profound effects on cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis,
and morphogenesis (1). They are currently used in the treatment of
epithelial cancer and promyelocytic leukemia and are being
evaluated as preventive and therapeutic agents for a variety of
human cancers, including breast cancer (2–4). The effects of
retinoids are mainly mediated by two classes of nuclear receptors,
the retinoic acid (RA) receptors (RAR) and retinoid X receptors
(RXR; refs. 1, 5). 9-Cis-RA is a high-affinity natural ligand for both
RARs and RXRs (6), whereas all-trans-RA is a high-affinity natural
ligand only for the RARs (7). RARs and RXRs are each encoded by
three distinct genes (a, b, c), which function as ligand-activated
transcription factors (1). RARs interact with RXRs, forming RXRRAR heterodimers that bind to RA response elements (RARE) to
control the expression of RA-responsive genes in the presence of

retinoids (1). Some of the target genes are RARs themselves, in
particular the RARb gene, for which a RARE (hRARE) was
identified in the promoter region (8).
Altered nuclear receptor activities are associated with carcinogenesis. In particular, loss of RARb expression was found in a
number of malignancies, including carcinomas of lung and breast,
and squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (9–11). A
growing body of literature has shown that the anticancer effect of
RA is primarily mediated by RARh, which is a potent tumorsuppressor protein (12, 13). For example, inhibition of RARb
expression in RARb-positive cancer cells abolished the RA-induced
apoptotic effect (14). Conversely, reexpression of RARb in RARbnegative cancer cells restored RA-induced growth inhibition,
apoptosis, and decreased tumorigenicity (12, 15). In phase I/II
clinical trials of breast cancer testing a combination of all-trans-RA
and tamoxifen, RARh expression was found to be consistently
elevated in the breast tissue (16). However, how RARh exerts its
anticancer activity is still largely unknown.
HOX gene expression is regulated by RA in embryonic cells and
tissues (17). In vertebrates, there are 39 HOX genes that are
organized into four clusters (i.e., HOXA, HOXB, HOXC, and HOXD;
ref. 18). In embryonic carcinoma cells, expression of the entire
HOXB gene cluster can be induced by RA treatment (19). In
contrast, in differentiated cells and tumor cells, very few HOX
genes can be induced by RA (20). Despite efforts to identify the
RAREs for HOX genes, only five RAREs have been identified for
5 of 39 HOX genes (HOXA1, HOXB1, HOXA4, HOXB4, and HOXD4;
refs. 21–24). HOXA5 expression has been shown to be regulated by
RA in embryonic carcinoma cells and in developing mouse lung
(25, 26). No RARE has yet been identified for HOXA5. How HOXA5
expression is regulated by RA and the role of HOX gene in RAmediated cellular function is poorly understood.
Recently, our laboratory has shown that HOXA5 expression is
lost in >60% breast cancer cell lines and primary tumors (27, 28).
Overexpression of HOXA5 in breast cancer cells induced apoptosis
(27, 29). To determine if HOXA5 expression can be reactivated by
RA, we treated a variety of breast cancer cells with RA and its
analogues. We found that HOXA5 expression can be induced only
in RARb-positive breast cancer cells. Further, we identified the
RARE to which RARh binds directly. We also showed that
induction of HOXA5 is important for RA-mediated apoptosis and
cellular growth inhibition. This study suggested that HOXA5 acts
directly downstream of RARb and plays an important role in RAmediated anticancer activity.

antagonist LE135 was kindly provided by Dr. Hiroyuki Kagechika (Tokyo
Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan). Western blot analysis was
done using standard procedure with antibodies to HOXA5 (Zymed) and
RARh (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
All breast cancer cell lines except MCF10A were maintained in DMEM
with 10% fetal bovine serum. MCF10A were maintained in DMEM/F12
containing 5% horse serum, 10 Ag/mL human insulin, 0.5 Ag/mL
hydrocortisone, and 100 ng/mL cholera toxin. MCF10A, T1K.C12, and
MCFCA.1h were obtained from Fred Miller and Robert Pauley (Karmanos
Cancer Institute, Detroit, MI) and were cultured in MCF10A medium (30).
Plasmids and transient transfection. The pLc-P1-Luc was constructed
by replacing the cytomegalovirus promoter sequence of the reporter
plasmid pLc-Luc with HOXA5 promoter sequence, which was amplified
using PCR with forward primer 5¶-GAGATCTAACCTCCTTCGGCTTTGCC-3¶
and reverse primer 5¶-CAAGCTTTGTGGCTCGCGGTCGTTTG-3¶. The pLcA5GF3-Luc was generated by inserting 6.5 kb of HOXA5 downstream
sequence into pLc-P1-Luc vector. To construct the deletion plasmid D1,
pLc-A5GF3-Luc was digested with (KpnI) and (EcoRI) to release a small
fragment of the downstream sequence followed by filling with Klenow
enzyme and self-ligation with T4 ligase. Similarly, pLc-A5GF3-Luc was cut
with EcoRI/NdeI to construct D2, BsaBI/NdeI to construct D3, KpnI/AfIII to
construct D4, and KpnI/MluI to construct D5. The deletion sequences in F1
to F4 was PCR amplified with primers (F1 forward primer 5¶-AGGTACCATGAAGACATCCAGCCTCAG-3¶; F2 forward primer 5¶-AGGTACCCATGGAGAGTGCAGAGCATT-3¶; F3 forward primer 5¶-AGGTACCAGTCTGTCATCGCCTAACAA-3¶; F4 forward primer 5¶-AGGTACCGGTGCTAACGAAGAGGTCAT-3¶ and reverse primer 5¶-ACATATGCAACCACTAGGGTTCACCTG-3¶), and cloned into D1 at the KpnI/MluI sites. The oligonucleotides
containing one or three copies of either site I or II were synthesized and
inserted into pGl3-Promoter vector to generate I-1, I-3, II-1, and II-3
plasmids. Similarly, II-3M, which contained three copies of mutated site II
sequence, was constructed. The same mutations were introduced into F1
construct to generate M1 and M2 constructs, respectively.
Transient transfection experiments were done as described previously
(31). At 24 h posttransfection, the cells were treated with 1 Amol/L of RA for
another 24 h before harvesting for luciferase assay according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Promega).
Establishment of HOXA5-short hairpin RNA stably transfected cell
lines. The HOXA5 short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-expressing plasmid was
constructed by inserting the synthesized oligonucleotides (oligo 1a:
5¶-GATCTCAGCGTCGGCCGCTTA-3¶ and oligo 1b: 5¶-AGCTTAAGCGGCCGACGCTGAGATC-3¶; oligo 2a: 5¶-AGCTTAGCGGCCGACGCTGAGATCCTTTTTG-3¶ and oligo 2b: 5¶-AATTCAAAAAGGATCTCAGCGTCGGCCGCTA-3¶)
into a modified vector pBS/U6 (32). The modified vector carries both a
green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene and a neomycin gene sequence. MCF7
cells were transfected with HOXA5 shRNA-expressing plasmid and empty
vector, and selected with 500 Ag/mL of G418 for 2 to 3 weeks. The GFPexpressing colonies were pooled and used in further experiments.
Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis. Real-time
reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis was done as previously
described (31). The primers used for the PCR are as follows: HOXA5
forward: 5¶-TCTCGTTGCCCTAATTCATCTTT-3¶ and reverse primer:
5¶-CATTCAGGACAAAGAGATGAACAGAA-3¶; and RARb forward primer:
5¶-CTGGATTTGGTCCTCTGACT-3¶ and reverse primer: 5¶-CATGTGAGGCTTGCTGGGTC-3¶. Native gel electrophoresis was used to characterize the final products. Data were first analyzed using the Sequence
Detector Software SDS 2.0 (Applied Biosystems). Results were calculated
and normalized relative to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
control by using the Microsoft Excel program. All of the PCR assays were
done in triplicate, and mean values are shown in figures.
Small interfering RNA transfection. RARb small interfering RNA
(siRNA) was purchased from Dharmacon, Inc. The breast cancer cell line,
Hs578T, was transiently transfected with RARb siRNA as described
previously (29).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis was done with the ChIP (Upstate Biotechnology)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Chromatin preparations were

made from 2  106 MCF7 cells transiently transfected with vector or RARbexpressing plasmids. The PCR primers included site II-specific forward
primer 5¶-AGAAGCAGGGCATCCTGAGA-3¶and reverse primer 5¶-CAACCACTAGGGTTCACCTG-3¶, and the control forward primer 5¶-TTGTGGCTCGCGGTCGTTTG-3¶ and reverse primer 5¶-CTCGCGGTCGTTTGTGCGTC-3¶.
Apoptosis analysis. Cells (1  105) in six-well plates were treated with
the desired concentration of RA and vehicle for 6 days. A total of 5  105
cells were used for cell cycle distribution analysis as described previously
(29). The sub–G1-G0 population represents the apoptotic cells.
Clonogenic assay. Five hundred cells per well were seeded in six-well
plates and allowed to attach overnight to the plastic substrate before the
addition of the indicated concentration of retinoids or vehicle. The medium
was replaced with retinoid-free medium for 2 to 3 weeks. As the colonies
became visible, cells were fixed with methanol, stained with Giemsa (1:10 in
distilled water), and counted.

Results
Induction of HOXA5 expression by RA in breast cancer cells.
With a goal to reactivate the expression of HOXA5 and inhibit
breast cancer cell growth, we treated a variety of breast cancer cells
with different concentrations of RA. We found that HOXA5
expression was induced in three of eight breast cancer cell lines
tested (Fig. 1A). To gain additional evidence to support the concept
that RA/HOXA5 signaling pathway was specifically blocked in most
breast cancer cells, we tested RA response using reporter plasmid
containing RARE in the promoter. The results indicated that most
of the breast cancer cell lines, except for MDAMB231 cells,
responded to RA treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1). A few cell
lines, such as ZR75.1 and MDAMB435, responded strongly to RA
treatment but failed to express HOXA5 upon RA induction.
Therefore, RA regulates the expression of its target genes through
more than one mechanism in breast cancer cells.
RA regulates gene expression through binding to its receptors
(RARs and RXRs). Because RXRa and RXRh are stably expressed
during mammary carcinogenesis and progression, and RXRg is not
detected in breast cells (33, 34), we examined the expression status
of RARs in normal breast and breast cancer cell lines. RARa and
RARg were expressed in almost all of the 12 breast cancer cell lines
examined, although the expression level varied from cell line to cell
line. However, RARh expression was detected in only four cell lines
(MCF10A, MCF7, MDAMB435, and Hs578T cells; Fig. 1B ).
Interestingly, HOXA5 expression was induced by RA in three of
these four RARb-positive cell lines, suggesting that RARh
expression is important for HOXA5 induction.
Consistent with this finding, we found that all-trans-RA, which
specifically binds to RARs, strongly induced HOXA5 expression.
9-Cis-RA and 13-cis-RA, which bind to both RARs and RXRs,
moderately activated HOXA5 expression (7). 4-HPR, which
selectively binds to RARg, very weakly activated HOXA5 expression
(35; Fig. 1C ). Further, RA-induced HOXA5 expression was
competitively inhibited by RARh-specific antagonist, LE135
(Fig. 1D; Supplementary Fig. S2; refs. 36, 37).
RARE is located in the 3¶-end of HOXA5 gene. To elucidate the
mechanism of the response of HOXA5 to RA, we first generated a
luciferase construct (pLc-P1-Luc) carrying the DNA sequence
upstream of HOXA5 coding region (Fig. 2A). Transient transfection
assays showed that the upstream DNA sequence failed to confer RA
responsiveness (Fig. 2B). A previous transgenic mouse study had
shown that the downstream DNA sequence is also important for
controlling spatiotemporal expression of murine Hoxa5 in vivo (38).
To test whether the RA-responsive element is located in the 3¶-end

of HOXA5 coding region, we added the 6.5 kb 3¶-end DNA sequence
to our construct (pLc-A5GF3-Luc; Fig. 2A). The new construct
showed a strong response to RA treatment, indicating that the
RARE is located in this 3¶-end fragment (Fig. 2B).
To identify the RARE in this 6.5-kb fragment, we generated a
series of deletion constructs. Transient transfection assays clearly
showed that the ability of the reporter constructs to respond to RA
depended on a 300-bp fragment located between the 5¶ ends of D5
and F4 constructs (Fig. 2C). The sequence of this 300-bp fragment
revealed two potential RAREs, which match or closely resemble the
RA half-site consensus sequence AGGTCA. To analyze the role of
these two potential binding sites in RA responsiveness, point
mutations were introduced into each of these two sites. Mutation
of site I had no dramatic effects on the responsiveness to RA,
whereas the mutation of site II significantly blocked the increase in
reporter activity in response to RA treatment (Fig. 2C). To confirm
that the site II sequence is a functional RARE, one or three copies
of the 13-bp site I and 15-bp site II nucleotides were synthesized,
and each was inserted in front of a SV40 promoter (Fig. 2D).
Transient transfection assay showed that the second binding site,
but not the first, conferred responsiveness to RA. Further, mutation
of this putative binding motif completely abolished its responsiveness to RA treatment (Fig. 2D).
RARB directly binds to the RARE and mediates HOXA5
induction in breast cancer cells. To further confirm that RARh
expression is important for HOXA5 induction, we cotransfected
the reporter construct (pLc-A5GF3-luc) with RAR- and RXRaexpressing vectors into CV-1 cells. CV-1 monkey kidney fibroblast
cells are widely used for testing RAR isotype-specific activities,
partly due to the low or absent endogenous level of expression of
all of the RARs (7, 39, 40). Although expression of each of the
RARs and RXRa restored HOXA5 RARE function to varying levels
in CV-1 cells, RARh expression most strongly up-regulated the

www.aacrjournals.org

response of HOXA5 RARE to RA treatment (Fig. 3A). Conversely,
knocking down of RARb expression in breast cancer cell line
Hs578T cells using siRNA blunted the induction of HOXA5
expression by RA (Fig. 3B). Further, ChIP assays confirmed that
both RARa and RARh bound strongly to the site II–containing
DNA region in vivo, whereas RARg bound weakly to this region
(Fig. 3C). These experiments provide strong support for the hypothesis that RARh expression is required for HOXA5 induction in
breast cancer cells.
Because the expression of both RARb and HOXA5 has been
reported to be lost during breast cancer progression, we wanted to
test whether there is a correlation between the expression patterns
of these two genes. We examined the expression status of HOXA5
and RARb in a MCF10A model of breast cancer development and
progression using real-time PCR (Fig. 3D). Each of these cell lines is
derived from parental MCF10A, an immortalized normal breast
epithelial cell line. Upon transplantation into immunodeficient
mice, MCF10A cells do not grow; T1k.C12 grow slowly and develop
morphologic structures similar to the hyperplasic lesions and
carcinoma in situ of the human breast; whereas MCFCA.1h cells are
malignant and develop tumors that infiltrate the surrounding
tissues, thus recapitulating multiple steps of progression in breast
cancer (30). MCF10A cells express both RARh and HOXA5. During
tumor progression in this model, the expression of both HOXA5
and RARb were coordinately lost, suggesting a correlation between
the loss of HOXA5 and RARh in a biologically relevant model
system (Fig. 3D). Due to the relatively low-level expression of RARh
in each member of the MCF10A series of cells, the reduction in
RARh expression at the mRNA level does not seem to be so
dramatic. However, previous studies, using the same model system,
have shown that progression and malignant transformation of
MCF10A cells is associated with loss of the induction of RARh at
both transcription and translation levels by RA (41).

HOXA5 induction contributes to RA-induced apoptosis and
cellular growth inhibition. RARh has been shown to mediate the
growth-inhibitory effect of RA by promoting apoptosis in breast
cancer cells (12, 15). In this study, we have presented evidence that
RARh directly regulated HOXA5 expression in breast cancer cells
(Fig. 2D). To test whether HOXA5 induction is functionally
important for RA-mediated cellular growth inhibition, we generated a MCF7 breast cancer cell line stably transfected with HOXA5
shRNA. In scrambled shRNA-transfected cells, HOXA5 expression
was strongly induced by RA. In contrast, in HOXA5-specific shRNA
transfected cells, induction of HOXA5 expression was greatly
decreased (Fig. 4A). Blockage of HOXA5 induction also partially
inhibited RA-induced apoptosis. Treatment for 6 days with 1 Amol/L
of RA resulted in apoptosis of 8.1% of scrambled shRNA-transfected
cells and 3.8% of HOXA5 shRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 4B).
Consistent with this finding, clonogenic assays showed that HOXA5
shRNA-transfected cells survived significantly better than scrambled shRNA-transfected cells in response to RA treatment (Fig. 4C).

Collectively, these results suggest that HOXA5 is a direct target of
RARb and is partially responsible for RA-mediated apoptosis and
cellular growth inhibition.

Discussion
Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that HOXA5
expression is lost in >60% primary breast carcinomas, and that
introduction of the HOXA5 gene into breast cancer cells induced
apoptosis through both p53-dependent and p53-independent
mechanisms (27, 29). By identifying upstream activators of HOXA5
expression, it might be possible to devise targeted treatment
strategies. Based on findings that HOXA5 expression is induced in
embryonic stem cells and developing mouse lung by RA (25, 42), we
hypothesized that HOXA5 expression is regulated in breast cells by
the RARs and/or RXRs. As predicted, we found that HOXA5
expression is induced by RA in the majority of RARb-positive breast
cells. Further, for the first time, we defined the RARE in the HOXA5

the known RA binding site for HOXA4. D, site II is a functional RARE in MCF7 cells. Transient transfections were done to test the responsiveness of site I and II to RA.

coding region, and showed that among the RARs, RARh is the
critical determinant of induction of HOXA5 and subsequent
apoptosis induced by RA.
HOXA5 is a direct target of RARh in breast cancer cells. We
identified a specific RARE in the 3¶ end of the HOXA5 coding
region. The RARE was a direct repeat site with a 3-bp spacing
(DR3); the first half site contained a consensus RA binding motif
(AGGTCA) to which, potentially, all of RARs can bind. Our transient
transfection and ChIP assays together showed that RA induced
HOXA5 expression preferably via RARa and RARh, but other RA
receptors (RARg and RXRa), when overexpressed, can also
functionally activate HOXA5 expression. It is important to note
that regardless of the expression status of other RARs in breast
cells, HOXA5 expression was induced only in RARh-positive cells.
This observation led us to reason that RARh may be the limiting
factor for HOXA5 induction or that this specificity may be
controlled by other cofactors that display preference for RARh in
breast cancer cells. In either scenario, it seems that RARh expression is the critical determinant of induction of HOXA5 expression.
Consistent with this hypothesis, knockdown of RARh expression
significantly blunted the induction of HOXA5 expression by RA.
In addition, the expression of HOXA5 and RARh was coordinately
lost during tumor progression and malignant transformation of
MCF10A cells. These findings of an apparent preference for RARh,
however, do not exclude the possibility that, under certain

www.aacrjournals.org

conditions, HOXA5 expression can be regulated by RA via other
RAR or RXR isoforms. Also, although HOXA5 is the direct target
of RARh, we found that high expression of RARh alone may not
predict the ability of RA to induce HOXA5 expression. For instance,
MDAMB435 cells express high levels of RARh but failed to induce
HOXA5 expression after RA treatment (Fig. 1A). Similarly, we could
not restore HOXA5 induction by reintroducing RARb into RARhnegative MDAMB231 cells (data not shown), implying that
additional cellular factors are required for HOXA5 induction in
breast cancer cells.
Role of HOXA5 in RA-induced anticancer effects. Retinoids
are effective inhibitors of breast cancer cell growth. Compared with
the relatively ubiquitous expression of RARa and RARg in breast
cancer cells, RARh expression is lost in majority of breast cancer
cell lines and primary breast carcinomas (33, 43), suggesting that
RARh may play an important part in breast tumorigenesis. Several
studies have shown that RARb behaves as a tumor-suppressor gene
in breast cancer and that induction of RARh mediates RA-induced
growth inhibition and apoptosis (12, 15, 44–47). However, the
mechanism by which RARh mediates cellular growth inhibition
and apoptosis is largely unknown. In this study, we have shown for
the first time that HOXA5 is one of the direct targets of RARh in
breast cancer cells.
Our previous studies have shown that HOXA5 induces apoptosis
in a p53-dependent (27), as well as a caspase-dependent, pathway

(29) in breast cancer cells. It is interesting to speculate that HOXA5
induction in breast cancer cells may bridge the RA signaling
pathway and apoptotic signaling pathways. Consistent with this
notion, when HOXA5 induction was blunted by shRNA in breast
cancer MCF7 cells, RA-induced apoptosis was also significantly
blocked.
RA-induced gene expression in the HOX clusters. RA is not
only a cancer prevention and therapeutic agent for cancer but is
also a key morphogen in vertebrate development. Retinoids induce
body axis formation in different animal systems while specifically
regulating the HOX genes (48, 49). Although HOX genes have been
known to be induced by RA shortly after they were identified in the
vertebrate, RAREs have been found only in two genes of HOX
paralog group 1 (HOXA1 and HOXB1) and three genes from group 4
(HOXA4, HOXB4 and HOXD4; 21, 22). The RAREs for the first
paralog HOX genes are located in the 3¶-end of the coding region,

whereas the RAREs for the fourth paralog genes are located in the 5¶end of the coding regions (21–24). Despite the fact that few RAREs
have been found in HOX genes, the entire cluster of HOX genes are
sequentially activated by RA in embryonic stem cells. Several
models, including direct and indirect regulation of HOX gene
expression by RA, have been proposed to explain this sequential
activation phenomenon. In one model, the HOX genes are activated
via an RA-responsive ‘‘locus control region,’’and binding of RA to the
RARE leads to opening up the chromatin structure of this region. In a
second model, the HOX genes located at 3¶-end of the cluster are
activated directly via the RARE enhancers; the protein products of
these genes activate the next 5¶-end genes in the clusters. In a third
model, multiple RAREs control the response of HOX genes with
differing affinities for RA (50). These models do not necessarily
exclude each other. Identification of HOXA5 RARE in this study
may support the third model although more RARE sites for other

HOX genes are yet to be identified. Much remains to be understood
regarding the precise role of HOX genes in RA-mediated cell death.
