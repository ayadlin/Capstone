ABSTRACT
NKX6.3 transcription factor is known to be an important regulator in gastric
mucosal epithelial differentiation. The present study aimed to investigate whether
NKX6.3 acts as an essential tumor suppressor in gastric carcinogenesis. Absent or
reduced protein expression and decreased DNA copy number and mRNA transcript
of the NKX6.3 gene were frequently observed in gastric cancers. Overexpression
of NKX6.3 in AGSNKX6.3 and MKN1NKX6.3 cells markedly arrested cell proliferation by
inhibiting cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis through both death receptorand mitochondrial-pathways. In addition, stable NKX6.3 transfectants increased
the expression of gastric differentiation markers, including SOX2 and Muc5ac, and
decreased the expression of intestinal differentiation markers, CDX2 and Muc2. In
ChIP-cloning and sequencing analyses, NKX6.3 coordinated a repertoire of target
genes, some of which are clearly associated with cell cycle, differentiation and death.
In particular, NKX6.3 transcriptional factor was found to bind specifically to the
upstream sequences of GKN1, a gastric-specific tumor suppressor, and dramatically
increase expression of the latter. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation
between NKX6.3 and GKN1 expression in non-cancerous gastric mucosae. Thus, these
data suggest that NKX6.3 may control the fate of gastric mucosal cells and function
as a gastric tumor suppressor.

INTRODUCTION

represent different stages of the gastric carcinogenesis
cascade [3]. Even though numerous advances in the
understanding of gastric cancer have been made, the
gastric cancer still remains one of the malignancies with
the highest incidence and mortality rates worldwide [4, 5].
Many homeodomain transcription factors play
pivotal roles in cell development and differentiation.
Among the homeobox genes, NKX family members are
involved in a variety of developmental processes, such
as cell fate determination in the central nervous system,
gastrointestinal tract, and pancreas [6]. NKX6.3, a
third member of the NKX6 subfamily of NKX gene, is
expressed in the epithelium of the most distal stomach
and eventually segregates to the lower/base region of

Generally, the gastrointestinal epithelium is
characterized by a very high cellular turnover rate, which
leads to epithelial renewal every 3-5 days, and apoptosis
is a key regulator of this turnover [1]. Pluripotent stem
cells occupy a niche in the isthmus or neck region of the
gastric glands. Post-mitotic cells migrate up or down from
the neck region toward the gland and differentiate into a
variety of cell types [2]. Recent data showed that gastric
mucosal inflammation is generally believed to be caused
by chronic Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and
atrophic gastritis, while intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia

the gastric unit [6, 7]. NKX6.3 is predicted to encode a
266-amino acid protein and is located in chromosome
8p11.21 [6]. Since NKX6.3 is expressed in post-mitotic
differentiated migrant cells of gastric units and loss of
heterozygosity at chromosome 8p11 has been frequently
detected [7, 8], we hypothesized that alteration of the
NKX6.3 gene may lead to abnormal differentiation and
homeostatic imbalance of gastric mucosal epithelium and
may eventually cause gastric cancer.
In this study, we demonstrated that NKX6.3 may
play a key role in gastric carcinogenesis by affecting the
processes of differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis of
gastric mucosal epithelium.

microsatellite markers D8S464 and D8S2329, which are
located -77.692 kb and +3.659 kb from the NKX6.3 locus,
respectively. We found that 18 (51.4 %) of 35 cases were
informative at D8S2329 marker and 10 (55.6%) of them
showed loss of heterozygosity (Supplementary Figure 1).
For D8S464, 12 (34.3%) cases showed heterozygosity
and 4 (33.3%) of them revealed loss of heterozygosity
(Supplementary Figure 1). In addition, 23 (65.7%) cases
were informative at D8S464 and/or D8S2329 markers,
and 12 (52.2%) of them showed allelic loss at one or both
markers, suggesting that reduced DNA copy number at the
NKX6.3 locus is frequent in gastric cancers.
All corresponding non-cancerous gastric mucosae
expressed the NKX6.3 gene transcript, and the loss or
reduced expression of mRNA transcript was observed
in 34 (61.8%) of the 55 gastric cancer tissues analyzed
(Figure 1E). There was a positive correlation between
DNA copy number and mRNA transcript of the NKX6.3
gene in both non-cancerous gastric mucosae and cancer
tissues (P < 0.0001) (Figure 1F). To further confirm our
results, we recapitulated the NKX6.3 gene expression
from the large cohorts of gastric cancer patients that are
available from the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
database (accession numbers GSE27342). The NKX6.3
gene expression was consistently down-regulated in the
gastric cancer cohorts (Figure 1F).

RESULTS
Reduced NKX6.3 protein expression in gastric
cancer cell lines and tissues
The NKX6.3 protein was found in 35 non-cancerous
gastric mucosal tissues including fundus, corpus, and
antrum, and its expression was lost or reduced in 33
(94.3%) of 35 gastric cancers (Figure 1A). Additionally,
AGS, MKN1, MKN28 and MKN45 gastric cancer cells
also showed no expression of the NKX6.3 protein,
whereas its marked expression was detected in AGS
cells transiently transfected with NKX6.3 (Figure 1B),
confirming tissue data and suggesting a role for NKX6.3
as a tumor suppressor.

NKX6.3 inhibits cell proliferation
As shown in Figure 2A, stable NKX6.3 transfectants
of AGSNKX6.3 and MKN1NKX6.3 cells showed marked
expression of the NKX6.3 protein relative to the empty
mock stable cells, AGSMock and MKN1Mock. Cell viability
and proliferation decreased dramatically in AGSNKX6.3 and
MKN1NKX6.3 cells in a time-dependent manner (Figure
2B and 2C). In addition, AGSNKX6.3 and MKN1NKX6.3 cells
significantly reduced the number and size of surviving
colonies compared with AGSMock and MKN1Mock cells
(Figure 2D), suggesting that the NKX6.3 expression
efficiently arrests cellular proliferation.

Mutations and methylation status of the NKX6.3
gene in gastric cancers
The presence of mutation, possibly associated with
reduced or loss of NKX6.3 expression, was examined by
sequencing analysis. Unexpectedly, none of the NKX6.3
mutations were detected in 55 gastric carcinomas (data not
shown).
We next assessed the methylation status of the
NKX6.3 gene in 55 paired non-cancerous gastric mucosa
and gastric cancer tissues. Unexpectedly, all cancer
and corresponding gastric mucosa cases showed both
methylated and unmethylated DNAs for the NKX6.3 gene
(Figure 1C).

NKX6.3 induces G0/G1 and G2/M arrests
Next, we examined the potential mechanisms
underlying the NKX6.3-induced inhibition of cell
proliferation. As shown in Figure 2E, NKX6.3 expression
had a modest effect on the G1 and G2/M cell cycle
progression.
For the G1 arrest, NKX6.3 up-regulated p53 and p21
expression and down-regulated CDK4/6, Cyclin D, and
Cyclin A expression (Figure 2F). Additionally, NKX6.3
suppressed the expression of p-Cdc2, Cyclin E, Cyclin B,
Cdc25c, and CDK1 proteins at G2/M transition in both
stable cells. However, NKX6.3 did not affect Chk1 and

DNA copy number and mRNA expression of the
NKX6.3 gene were reduced in gastric cancers
In real time-QPCR analysis, the copy number
of the NKX6.3 gene was reduced in 18 (32.7%) of 55
gastric cancer DNAs, compared to the surrounding
gastric mucosa DNAs (Figure 1D). We also examined
allelic loss of the NKX6.3 gene in 35 gastric cancers with

mucosal epithelium were chosen (Figure 5B). Significant
expression changes were verified by real time RT-PCR
(Figure 5C-5E).

NKX6.3 induces apoptosis

NKX6.3 induces GKN1 expression

NKX6.3 induced apoptosis in a time-dependent
manner in AGSNKX6.3 and MKN1NKX6.3 cells, compared with
AGSMock and MKN1Mock (Figure 3A). Caspase 3/7 activity
was significantly enhanced in a time-dependent manner.
Additionally, cleaved forms of Caspase 8, Caspase 3,
and PARP were found in AGSNKX6.3 and MKN1NKX6.3 cells
(Figure 3B and 3C). Increased expression of FAS, FADD,
truncated BID, BAX, BAK1 and cytochrome C as well as
decreased expression of Bcl-XL, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 were
detected (Figure 3C). Next, we performed a JC-1 staining
assay to determine the effect of NKX6.3 on mitochondrial
membrane potential. AGSMock and MKN1Mock cells stained
with JC-1 showed red fluorescence, whereas AGSNKX6.3
and MKN1NKX6.3 cells exhibited a heterogeneous staining
with both red and green fluorescence coexisting in the
same cells (Figure 3D).

Interestingly, NKX6.3 dramatically increased the
expression of GKN1, a gastric-specific tumor suppressor,
at the mRNA level (Figure 5A). To identify a NKX6.3
binding site within the GKN1 gene promoter upstream
sequences, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay
followed by PCR was performed in AGSMock, MKN1Mock,
AGSNKX6.3 and MKN1NKX6.3 cells. We defined the region
upstream of the GKN1 gene (between -5 kb and +1
kb), overlapping with the transcription start site (TSS)
designated 0 kb. We constructed 6 reporter vectors
containing 6 kb fragments in positions P1 (-5 to +1 kb),
P2 (-4 to +1 kb), P3 (-3 to +1 kb), P4 (-2 to +1 kb), P5 (-1
to +1 kb), and P6 (TSS to +1 kb). Each fragment contained
18, 14, 10, 9, 4, and 3 putative NKX6.3 binding motifs.
As shown in Figure 6A, NKX6.3 binding activity was
detected from -5 kb to +1 kb relative to the GKN1 TSS in
AGS (Figure 6A) and MKN1 cells (Supplementary Figure
2A). Luciferase assay was performed to determine more
precisely the location of the NKX6.3 transcription factor
binding within the enriched fragment. NKX6.3 occupancy
was 20-fold enriched at the P4 region compared to the
control (Figure 6A and Supplementary Figure 2B). Thus,
the P4 promoter region was subdivided into 640, 415, 280
and 150-bp fragments containing these binding motifs
(Figure 6B), and the appropriate primers were designed
(Supplementary Table 1). Significant enrichments of 18,
14, and 12-fold were observed for the fragment containing
the first 4 binding motifs, whereas a weak 4-fold
enrichment was observed for the fragment containing the
5th binding motif (Figure 6B and Supplementary Figure
2C). In line with the results of ChIP and luciferase assays
described above, NKX6.3 dramatically increased the
expression of GKN1 at the mRNA and protein levels
(Figure 6C). There was a positive correlation between
NKX6.3 and GKN1 in non-cancerous gastric mucosal
tissues and in the NCBI GEO database (accession numbers
GSE27342) (Figure 6D). These findings suggest that
NKX6.3 may positively control the expression of GKN1.
To determine whether the tumor suppressor effect
of NKX6.3 is dependent on GKN1, we analyzed cell
viability and proliferation in AGSNKX6.3 and MKN1NKX6.3
cells after GKN1 silencing with shGKN1 (Supplementary
Figure 3). GKN1 silencing partially inhibited the effects of
NKX6.3 on cell viability, proliferation, colony formation,
and cell cycle progression (Figure 7A-7E). However,
GKN1 silencing did not affect NKX6.3-induced apoptosis,
Caspase 3/7 activity and expression of mitochondrial
pathway-related proteins or mitochondrial membrane
potentials (Figure 7F-7I). Collectively, these results

NKX6.3 regulates gastric differentiation
Next, we investigated whether NKX6.3 regulates the
expression of gastric foveolar mucin Muc5ac, goblet cell
mucin Muc2, and CDX2 genes using immunofluorescent
analysis and real-time RT-PCR. Expectedly, NKX6.3
increased protein and mRNA expression of Muc5ac
(Figure 4A) and reduced expression of Muc2 and CDX2
(Figure 4B and 4C) in a time-dependent manner in both
NKX6.3 stable cells, suggesting that NKX6.3 may induce
gastric differentiation and inhibit intestinal differentiation.
To further confirm these data, we examined the
expression of proteins that induce intestinal differentiation
at 1, 3 and 5 days after cell culture. Expectedly, NKX6.3
stable transfectants showed increased expression of the
gastric marker SOX2 and reduced expression of the Ki67, Lgr5, and CDX2 proteins (Figure 4D). These results
indicate that NKX6.3 may modulate gastric and intestinal
markers.

addition, since NKX6.3 functions as a master regulator

manner.

results suggest that NKX6.3 may function as a tumor
suppressor by inhibiting cell cycle progression in gastric
cancer.
We also found that stable expression of NKX6.3
induces apoptosis and enhances Caspase 3/7 activity in
AGSNKX6.3 and MKN1NKX6.3 cells in a time-dependent
manner (Figure 3A and 3B). In addition, expression
of apoptosis-related proteins, including FAS, FADD,
cleaved-Caspase 8, tBID, BAX, Cytochrome C,
cleaved-Caspase 3 and PARP, was detected (Figure 3C).
Furthermore, NKX6.3 significantly reduced mitochondrial
membrane potential in JC-1 staining assay (Figure 3D).
Thus, we concluded that NKX6.3 may stimulate cell death
through both death receptor- and mitochondrial-pathways.
Together with the results presented in Figure 3, our data
indicate that NKX6.3 may function as a tumor suppressor
for gastric cancer by inducing apoptosis as well as cell
cycle arrest.
In mice, NKX6.3 expression was detected in the
glandular stomach, which segregates the lower/base
region of the gastric unit, and its expression was activated
in the course of differentiation in the antral part of the
mouse stomach [6, 7]. In the human stomach, NKX6.3
expression was observed in the corpus and antrum, which
are covered by mucous-secreting columnar epithelium
(Figure 1A). Notably, NKX6.3 induced the expression of
gastric foveolar mucin Muc5ac at the protein and mRNA
level (Figure 4A), while it reduced the expression of the
goblet cell mucin Muc2 and CDX2, an intestinal-specific
homeobox transcription factor (Figure 4B and 4C). It is
widely known that altered expression of Muc5ac with the
aberrant expression of Muc2 and CDX2 was detected in
intestinal metaplasia of the stomach, which is considered
to be a preneoplastic stage of gastric carcinogenesis
[12-15]. Interestingly, NKX6.3 down-regulated the
expression of Ki-67 (proliferative marker), Lgr5 and
CDX2 (intestinal markers), and up-regulated expression
of the gastric marker SOX2 (Figure 4D). These results are
consistent with the observation that cells expressing the
mutant NKX6.3 gene may represent immature cells [7]
and suggest that NXK6.3 may play an important role in
gastric homeostasis and tumorigenesis by inducing gastric
differentiation and preventing intestinal differentiation in
gastric mucosal epithelial cells. Therefore, it is likely that
NKX6.3 depletion may render gastric mucosal epithelial
cells subject to subsequent genetic or epigenetic alterations
in tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes.
Targets of the NKX6.3 transcription factor in the
gastric mucosal epithelium are poorly characterized. In
ChIP-cloning and sequencing analyses, we identified a
repertoire of candidate NKX6.3 target genes involved
in regulation of the cell cycle, death and differentiation
(Figure 5). We confirmed by real-time RT-PCR that
NKX6.3 coordinates the expression of these genes,
including GKN1, in AGSNKX6.3 and MKN1NKX6.3 cells
(Figure 5). Previously, we demonstrated that GKN1

DISCUSSION
Loss of tissue-specific differentiation processes
is necessary for tumors to reach a primitive and poorly
differentiated state [10]. Here, we found loss or reduced
expression of NKX6.3 protein in AGS, MKN1, MKN28,
and MKN45 gastric cancer cell lines and 33 (94.3%) of 35
gastric cancer tissues (Figure 1A and 1B). To determine
whether reduced NKX6.3 expression is caused by somatic
or epigenetic changes of the NKX6.3 gene, we performed
mutational and methylation studies of NKX6.3 gene. There
were no somatic mutation and hypermethylation of the
gene (Figure 1C), suggesting that genetic and epigenetic
alterations of NKX6.3 may not play an important role in
the development of gastric cancer. To further identify the
mechanism underlying NKX6.3 inactivation in gastric
cancers, DNA copy number and mRNA transcript levels of
the NKX6.3 gene were examined by real-time QPCR and
real-time RT-PCR, respectively. Interestingly, markedly
decreased DNA copy number and mRNA transcript
expression of NKX6.3 were found in 18 (32.7%) and
34 (61.8%) of 55 gastric cancers, respectively (Figure
1D and 1E). Additionally, frequent allelic loss (52.2%)
at the NKX6.3 locus was detected in gastric cancers
(Supplementary Figure 1). These results are consistent with
previous reports describing 30% of loss of heterozygosity
at chromosome 8p11.21 [8], in which NKX6.3 resides,
as well as reduced NKX6.3 mRNA expression in gastric
cancers detected by microarray analysis [11]. When we
compared the DNA copy number with mRNA transcript
expression of NKX6.3, there was a positive correlation
between two variables in non-cancerous gastric mucosa
and cancer tissues (P < 0.0001) (Figure 1F). Furthermore,
NKX6.3 expression was significantly down-regulated in
gastric cancer cohorts (Figure 1F). These data suggest that
decreased DNA copy number and mRNA transcript of
the NKX6.3 gene may be a driving event behind NKX6.3
inactivation in gastric cancer.
Next, we asked whether NKX6.3 could control
cell growth and death. Expectedly, stable expression of
NKX6.3 showed a time-dependent inhibition of cell
viability, proliferation and colony formation in AGSNKX6.3
and MKN1NKX6.3 cells (Figure 2B-2D). There was a
concurrent increase of G1 and G2/M phases in AGSNKX6.3
and MKN1NKX6.3 cells (Figure 2E). NKX6.3 selectively
induced p53 and p21 expression and elicited concomitant
suppression of CDK4, CDK6, Cyclin A, and Cyclin
D expression in the G1/S transition. It also triggered
suppression of p-Cdc2, Cdc25c, CDK1, Cyclin B, and
Cyclin E expression in the G2/M transition, but did not
affect the expression of Chk1 and Chk2, key components
of the DNA damage signaling network (Figure 2F). These

inactivation is frequently detected in gastric cancers and
that GKN1 inhibits cell proliferation while inducing
senescence and apoptosis [16-19]. Thus, we investigated
whether NKX6.3 functions as a transcriptional factor
for GKN1. Reporter gene assay showed that NKX6.3
occupancy was 20-fold enriched at the P4 region
containing 9 putative NKX6.3 binding motifs (TAAT)
(Figure 6A and Supplementary Figure 2A and 2B).
Further deletion of the 5’ sequence resulted in progressive
loss of promoter activity. The constructs containing
the first 4 binding motifs resulted in a significant
increase in promoter activity up to 18 fold (Figure
6B and Supplementary Figure 2C), indicating that
NKX6.3 binding motifs in this region are required for
transcriptional up-regulation of GKN1. Expectedly, GKN1
expression was affected at the mRNA and protein levels
in only AGSNKX6.3 and MKN1NKX6.3 cells (Figure 6C). We
therefore concluded that NKX6.3 functions as a master
regulator of gastric mucosal epithelial cells by regulating
the expression of cell fate-related proteins and that GKN1
is one of the transcription targets of NKX6.3.
Next, we asked whether the NKX6.3 activity is
dependent on the GKN1. Interestingly, treatment with
shGKN1 showed partial ablation of the NKX6.3-induced
growth-inhibitory activity (Figure 7A-7E). However,
GKN1 silencing did not affect NKX6.3 induced apoptosis,
Caspase 3/7 activity and mitochondrial membrane
potential (Figure 7F-7I), suggesting that NKX6.3
may activate not only the death receptor, but also the
mitochondrial pathway. Overall, these data indicate that
NKX6.3 employs GKN1-dependent and -independent
mechanisms for the regulation of cell cycle and death.
In conclusion, complete loss or significantly reduced
expression of NKX6.3 protein was frequently observed in
gastric cancers. Decreased DNA copy number and mRNA
transcript of the NKX6.3 gene was a driving force behind
NKX6.3 inactivation in gastric cancers. In functional
analysis, NKX6.3 markedly arrested cell proliferation by
inhibiting cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis
through both death receptor- and mitochondrial-pathways.
In addition, NKX6.3 increased expression of the gastric
differentiation markers, including SOX2 and Muc5ac,
and decreased expression of the intestinal differentiation
markers, CDX2 and Muc2. Furthermore, NKX6.3
regulated a repertoire of target genes associated with
cell fate resulting in gastric differentiation, inhibition of
cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in GKN1dependent and independent manners. Thus, we conclude
that the NKX6.3 gene may play an important role in
the development of gastric cancer, acting as a tumor
suppressor.

Human gastric samples
A total of 55 frozen gastric cancers were obtained
from the Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital,
which is supported by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and
Family Affairs. Informed consent was provided according
to the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent
was obtained from all subjects. The study was approved by
the Institutional Review Board of The Catholic University
of Korea, College of Medicine (MC15SISI0015). There
was no evidence of familial cancer in any of the patients.

Mutational and methylation analyses of the
NKX6.3 gene in gastric cancers
Genomic DNAs from each tumor and corresponding
non-cancerous gastric mucosal cells were amplified with
6 sets of primers covering the entire coding region of
the NKX6.3 gene. The specific primers for detection of
NKX6.3 mutation were designed according to the genomic
sequence of Genbank accession No. NC_000008.11. The
primer sequences are described in Supplementary Table
2. Each polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure
was performed, as described in the literature with minor
modifications [16].
Methylation status of the promoter region of the
NKX6.3 gene was determined using sodium bisulfite
treatment of DNA followed by MSP, as described in the
literature with minor modifications [16].

DNA copy number changes and mRNA expression
of NKX6.3 in gastric cancers
After quantification of genomic DNA and mRNA
extracted from gastric cancers and corresponding noncancerous gastric mucosae, real-time SYBR Green QPCR
was performed on a Stratagene Mx 3000P QPCR system.
Specific primers for detection of the NKX6.3 DNA copy
number were designed according to the genomic sequence
of Genbank accession No. NC_000008.11. All samples
were subjected to PCR amplification with oligonucleotide
primers specific for the constitutively expressed gene,
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH),
and normalized. Primers for SYBR Green analysis were
designed based on the gene-specific non-homologous
DNA sequences. The primer sequences are described in
Supplementary Table 2.
cDNA was synthesized using the reverse
transcription kit from Roche Molecular System (Roche,
Mannheim, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. For QPCR, 50 ng cDNA was amplified using
28436

Oncotarget

Fullvelocity SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix (Stratagene,
La Jolla, CA, USA) and 20 pmol/μl of each primer
(forward and reverse) using Stratagene Mx 3000P QPCR
system, according techniques previously published [16].
Due to low Ct value, real-time RT PCR was carried out
for 45 cycles. To ensure the fidelity of mRNA extraction
and reverse transcription, all samples were subjected to
PCR amplification with oligonucleotide primers specific
for the constitutively expressed gene, glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and normalized. The
standard curve method was used for quantification of the
relative amounts of gene expression products. This method
provides unit-less normalized expression values that can
be used for direct comparison of the relative amounts of
target DNA and mRNA in different samples. All samples
were tested in duplicate, and the average values were used
for quantification. Reduced DNA copy number and mRNA
expression were defined as a mean test (cancer)/reference
(mucosa) ratio.

Stable expression of NKX6.3 was confirmed in AGSNKX6.3
and MKN1NKX6.3 cells by western blot analysis.

Measurement of cell viability, proliferation, and
colony formation
Cell viability, proliferation, and colony formation
were analyzed using MTT, BrdU and clonogenic assays,
as described previously [16-18].

Measurement of apoptosis and flow-cytometric
analysis of the cell cycle
For apoptosis assessment, annexin V-binding assay
was performed at 1 to 5 days in AGSMock, MKN1Mock,
AGSNKX6.3 and MKN1NKX6.3 cells, as described previously
[21]. To confirm whether NKX6.3 induces apoptosis
and the effects of GKN1 on NKX6.3-induced apoptosis
caused by caspase activation, we examined Caspase-3 and
-7 activity using an Apo-One Homogeneous Caspase 3/7
assay kit (Promega) as described previously [21].
For measurement of mitochondrial membrane
potential, cells were stained with the cationic dye
JC-1 (MitoPT, Immunohistochemistry Technologies),
which exhibits potential-dependent accumulation in
mitochondria.
For cell cycle analysis, the cells from each
experimental group were collected and stained with PI
for 45 min in the dark before analysis. The percentages of
cells in different phases of the cell cycle were determined
using a FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer with CellQuest 3.0
software (BD Biosciences).

Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis for the
NKX6.3 gene locus
We analyzed allelic loss with two microsatellite
markers, D8S464 and D8S2329. DNAs extracted
from tumor and corresponding non-cancerous gastric
mucosa were amplified using a thermal cycler (MJ
Research Institute, Watertown, MA, USA) with the two
microsatellite markers, as described previously [20].
The PCR products were loaded onto a SSCP gel (FMC
Mutation Detection Enhancement system; Intermountain
Scientific, Kaysville, UT, USA) containing 10% glycerol.
Complete absence or at least 50% reduced intensity of
one allele in the tumor DNA of the informative cases
was considered as LOH. To confirm theses results,
sequencing of the PCR products was carried out using
an ABI-377 automated fluorescent DNA sequencer
(Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK), according to the
manufacturer`s recommendations.

Reverse transcription and real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted following the TRIzol
Reagent (Invitrogen) protocol. Two micrograms of total
RNA was used in reverse transcription following the
Superscript III (Invitrogen) protocol. Quantitative PCR
was performed on an IQ5 optical system (Bio-rad) using
SYBR Green Q-PCR Master Mix (Bio-rad), according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Primer sequences of the
genes are described in Supplementary Tables 3-4. Gene
expression data were normalized to GAPDH.

Cell culture and transfection of NKX6.3
AGS and MKN1 gastric cancer cells lines were
cultured at 37oC in 5% CO2 in RPMI-1640 medium with
10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Complete
NKX6.3-cDNA was cloned into the expression vector
pCMV6-Myc-DDK (Origene). AGS and MKN1 cells were
transiently transfected with expression plasmids (5 µg total
DNA) in 60 mm-diameter dishes using Lipofectamine
Plus transfection reagent (Invitrogen), according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations.
We also generated stable NKX6.3 transfectants of
AGS and MKN1 cells, AGSNKX6.3 and MKN1NKX6.3, stably
expressing human NKX6.3, as well as mock transfectants,
AGSMock and MKN1Mock cells, as described previously [18].

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)

digested with KpnI and XhoI enzymes and then ligated into
a pGL4.10[luc2] vector that was digested with the same
enzymes. Luciferase reporter assay was performed using
a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega)
following the manufacturer`s protocol.

For assessing the NKX6.3 binding activity in the
promoter region of GKN1, ChIP assays were performed
using the Thermo Scientific Pierce Agarose ChIP kit
(Thermo Scientific Pierce), as described previously [18].
DNA amplification was performed by PCR using primers
for the GKN1 promoter described in Supplementary Table
1. Amplification products were separated on a 2% agarose
gel.

Statistical analysis
Student’s t-test was used to analyze the effect of
NKX6.3 on cell viability. Data are expressed as means
± S.D. from at least three independent experiments. The
linear regression, correlation, and Chi-square tests were
used to examine the association of DNA copy number
change with mRNA and protein expression of the NKX6.3
gene. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered to be the
limit of statistical significance.

Cloning of the ChIP fragments
The immunoprecipitated DNA was cloned as
described previously [22]. Briefly, the DNA isolated from
ChIP was heated at 68°C for 5 min and then cooled to
37°C. One to two units of T4 DNA polymerase were
added to the DNA and reaction mix containing repair
buffer (18 mM ammonium sulfate, 66 mM Tris [pH 8.0],
6.6 mM MgCl2, 50 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mM
of each nucleotide) and subsequently incubated at 37°C
for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by 1 μl of 0.5
M EDTA for a 50 μl reaction mix. The processed DNA
was cloned into pUC118 Hinc II/BAP vector (Takara).
Each ligation was transformed into DH-5α competent
cells (Clontech). The entire transformation was plated
onto ampicillin treated Luria broth agar plates. Randomly
picked 120 colonies with inserts were identified by PCR
using M13 primers spanning the cloning site in the vector.
Inserts > 200 bp were selected for sequencing using a
capillary automatic sequencer (3730 DNA Analyzer,
Applied Biosystem). The BLAST search of the human
genome database at NCBI was performed to locate
sequences. The possible genomic binding sequences were
identified by pattern matching. Specific sequences were
also analyzed using BLAST adjusted to short sequences
(Program = blastn, Word size = 7, Expect Value = 100,
Filter = disabled). The sequence logo was generated by
WebLogo (http://weblogo.berkeley.edu/logo.cgi).
