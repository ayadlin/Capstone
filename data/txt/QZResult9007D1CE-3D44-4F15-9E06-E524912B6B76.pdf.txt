BACKGROUND: The primary objective of this phase 2 study was to assess the objective response rate
(complete response [CR] þ partial responses [PR]), by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, of PF3512676, a CpG oligodeoxynucleotide, alone in 2 doses or in combination with dacarbazine (DTIC) in
patients with unresectable stage IIIB/C or stage IV malignant melanoma, with the aim of selecting an arm
to take forward to a phase 3 portion of the study. METHODS: A total of 184 patients were randomized to
1 of 4 treatments: PF-3512676 10 mg (low dose), at 40 mg (high dose), 40 mg plus DTIC (850 mg/m2), or
DTIC (850 mg/m2) alone. Patients received PF-3512676 subcutaneously weekly in a 3-week cycle and
received DTIC intravenously on the first week of the cycle. RESULTS: The objective response rate (PR or
CR, confirmed or unconfirmed) in the 40 mg þ DTIC arm was 16% (7 patients) compared with 8%
(3 patients) with DTIC alone. One (2%) patient in the 10-mg and 0 patients in the 40-mg arms achieved an
objective response. Best response of CR or PR or stable disease (SD), with no minimum duration defined
for SD, was achieved by 15 (33%) patients in the 40 mg þ DTIC arm, 15 (38%) patients in the DTIC-only
arm, 8 (17%) patients in the 10-mg arm, and 9 (20%) patients in the 40-mg arm. The most frequently
reported adverse events were classified as local injection site reactions or systemic flu-like symptoms, specifically fatigue, rigors, and pyrexia. CONCLUSIONS: PF-3512676 at the doses used was generally well tolerated. The modest objective response rates observed in all arms did not warrant continuation to the phase

cytosine and guanine dinucleotides (CpG motifs), which
are common in prokaryotic but underrepresented and
predominantly methylated in vertebrate DNA, act as
pharmacologic ligands for TLR9.10 B Cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are known to express TLR9 in
humans.11 CpG ODNs can specifically bind to endosomal TLR9, which induces the production of cytokines
and expression of increased levels of costimulatory molecules by B cells and pDCs.12 pDCs produce high levels of
type I interferons and can produce a variety of other cytokines and chemokines to promote Th1-like immune
responses involving other cell types, including additional
dendritic cell subsets, monocytes, natural killer (NK) cells,
and neutrophils.10,11 pDCs activated through TLR9 may
also promote antigen-specific antitumor CD4 and CD8
T-cell responses. These immunomodulatory activities
may explain the additive antitumor effects seen with single-agent CpG ODNs and the additive or synergistic activity when CpG ODNs are combined with
antineoplastic therapies in preclinical models. One hypothesis to explain this synergy is that the cytolytic activity
of the antineoplastic drug releases tumor antigens, and
pDCs that have been activated through TLR9 present
these antigens in a highly stimulatory context, leading to
the generation of tumor-antigen specific cytolytic T cells.
In vivo investigations of the antitumor effects of the
ODN PF-3512676 in rodent models indicate that it has
antitumor effects.12,13 When given via peritumoral injections, PF-3512676 prolonged survival and decreased tumor volumes in mice bearing Lewis lung cell carcinoma,
renal cell carcinoma, or neuro-2a neuroblastoma tumors.
When given via subcutaneous injections, PF-3512676
prolonged survival of tumor-bearing mice in both metastatic Lewis lung carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma
models.12,13 The immunologic mechanisms for its antitumor actions vary among tumor types; some are mediated
by NK cells, and others are T cell dependent. PF3512676 also demonstrated synergistic antitumor effects
with chemotherapy and radiation.14,15 Significant therapeutic effects were also seen with human tumor xenografts
in nude mice.16
In early phase clinical trials, PF-3512676 alone has
had some antitumor activity and a good safety profile in
patients with unresectable stage III B/C or stage IV melanoma.17 On the basis of these data, the current trial tested

of 40 mg, the combination of PF-3512676 (40 mg) with
dacarbazine (DTIC), and DTIC alone in subjects with
unresectable stage III B/C or IV melanoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Trial Eligibility
This study was conducted in North America and Europe.
Patients were required to have unresectable stage III B/C
or stage IV melanoma and measurable disease by
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).
Age >18 years, Karnofsky performance status (KPS)
>70, adequate hematologic and chemical parameters, and
lactate dehydrogenase 3 times the upper limit of normal
were required. Patients who had received prior systemic
treatment for recurrent or metastatic disease were
excluded. Patients with suspected or known central nervous system metastases, ocular or mucosal melanomas, or
preexisting autoimmune or antibody-mediated diseases
were excluded.
Patients were ineligible if they were known to have
hypersensitivity to any of the components of the PF3512676 injection or to DTIC, or if they had serious
medical or psychiatric conditions that would hinder the
their ability to fully comply with the protocol. Women
who were pregnant or lactating were also excluded.
PF-3512676
PF-3512676 injection as a solution of 10 mg/mL in preservative-free phosphate-buffered saline was supplied in
colorless glass vials containing 1 mL of solution by Coley
Pharmaceutical Group (Ottawa, Ontario, Canada). PF3512676 was administered as split doses in volumes of
1 mL per injection or less that were to be injected subcutaneously at different anatomic sites (ie, abdominal wall,
upper arm, hip, or anterior thigh). Injection sites were
rotated between dosing days.
Treatment
After informed consent was obtained and screening completed, patients were stratified by lesion location as M1a/b
versus M1c, with M1a/b defined as lesions limited to the
skin or subcutaneous tissues (‘‘localized’’), lymph nodes,
or lung (M1a/b), and M1c defined as metastatic lesions
located elsewhere in the body, and then randomized in

equal numbers to 1 of 4 treatment arms: PF-3512676 at a
low dose (10 mg in 2 5-mg injections) (10 mg), PF3512676 at a higher dose (40 mg in 4 10-mg injections)
(40 mg), PF-3512676 plus DTIC (850 mg/m2) (40 mg
þ DTIC), or DTIC (850 mg/m2) (DTIC) alone. Patients
received PF-3512676 on all 3 weeks of a 3-week cycle and
received DTIC on the first week of the cycle. Patients
randomized to either arm containing 40 mg PF-3512676
received 20 mg (2 10-mg injections) for the first 2 weeks
of their treatment period and 40 mg (4 10-mg injections)
thereafter. Response was assessed after 3 cycles of therapy
at Week 9, then every 2 cycles or 6 weeks thereafter. Toxicities were assessed according to Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events 3.0 criteria.
Pharmacokinetics
The plasma concentration of PF-3512676 was determined by treatment arm and by collection time (predose,
30 minutes, 60 minutes, 4 hours, 8  2 hours, and 24
hours post dose). The maximum level of the PF-3512676
plasma concentration, the time to maximum level, the
area under the curve to the last measurable level (AUC0last), and the elimination half life (T1=2) were computed.
AUC0-last was computed using the trapezoidal rule, and
T1=2 was computed as the natural log2/terminal slope.
Patients allocated to the DTIC arm were not included in
these analyses.
Pharmacodynamic Cytokine Assays
Cytokines assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay included interferon (IFN)-a, interleukin (IL)-6, IL12, INF-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and C-reactive protein (CRP).
Serum samples were collected before and at 2 time points
(ie, once between 8 and 18 hours, and once at 24 hours)
after each injection of PF-3512676 in the first cycle
(Cycle 1, Week 1; and Cycle 1, Week 2) and the third
cycle (Cycle 3, Week 1; and Cycle 3, Week 2). These data
from the first cycle were analyzed and are presented by
treatment arm.
Statistics
Efficacy analyses were based on the randomized-andtreated population, which was defined as all randomized
subjects who received at least 1 dose of study treatment.
3946

Safety summaries were based on the safety population,
which was defined as all subjects who received any
treatment.
This randomized study was designed as a phase 2
study that could extend to a randomized phase 3. In the
phase 2 portion, the sample size of 160 patients (40 in
each treatment group) was chosen to clinically characterize adequate numbers of patient responses, estimated to
be about 15% with chemotherapy alone. No formal statistical sample size computation was performed, but treatment arms likely to show meaningful clinical benefit
compared with DTIC alone were to be identified, and
carried forward into the phase 3 portion of the study. A
clinically meaningful improvement in response was to be
defined as greater than the historical 15% response rate of
DTIC alone. If responses were equivalent, then the regimen that was better tolerated could be carried forward.
The primary endpoint was objective response rate determined according to the investigator’s report, by RECIST,
using confirmed and unconfirmed complete or partial
responses. A 95% confidence interval for the objective
response rate (ORR) was calculated for each treatment
arm. The percentage of patients with a best response of
clinical benefit (partial response [PR], complete response
[CR], or stable disease [SD], with no minimum duration
of SD required) was calculated as well as the percentages
of patients with best response of PR, CR, SD, or progressive disease. Progression-free survival, time to progression,
and overall survival were assessed by the Kaplan-Meier
method.
Pharmacodynamic data were analyzed and summarized by using descriptive statistics by treatment arm for
each collection time point.

RESULTS
Demographics
Patient mean ages ranged from 55 to 63 years. The overall
patient mean (and median) age was 59 years, and 63%
were male. One hundred seventy-four of 176 (99%)
patients were Caucasian, with 1 Asian and 1 Hispanic
patient in the 10-mg arm. At baseline, 78% of patients
had a KPS of 90. The median time since diagnosis of
melanoma was 28 months, and 93% of patients had stage
IV (7% had stage III) disease. Forty-six percent to 47% of

PF-3512676–containing arms were comprised of patients
in the M1a/b stratum, whereas 41% of the DTIC-alone
arm was comprised of patients in the M1a/b stratum.
Four patients in the M1a/b stratum and 4 in the M1c stratum were randomized to DTIC and either elected not to
participate, or could not be treated, contributing to this
imbalance. None of the indicated demographic characteristics were statistically significantly different between the
4 groups except for prior immunotherapy, which had
been given to 56% of 40-mg þ DTIC patients compared
with only 23% of DTIC patients (P ¼ .01). Demographic
data are summarized in Table 1.

Toxicities
With the exception of 1 patient in the 40-mg arm who
suffered a myocardial infarction and died, no severe irreversible treatment-related side effects or treatment-related
deaths were noted. Treatment-emergent adverse events of
any grade were experienced by 45 (98%) patients in the
10-mg arm, 46 (100%) patients in the 40-mg arm, 45
(100%) patients in the 40-mg þ DTIC arm, and 36
(92%) patients in the DTIC arm. Fifteen patients had
treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs).
Cancer

September 1, 2009

Four patients in the 10-mg arm and 5 patients in the
40-mg arm had treatment-related SAEs; 1 patient in the
40-mg am died of a myocardial infarction. Four patients
in the 40-mg þ DTIC arm and 1 patient in the DTIC
arm had an SAE considered related to the drug.
Local injection site reactions, systemic flu-like symptoms (eg, fatigue, pyrexia, rigors), gastrointestinal disorders (eg, nausea and vomiting), and musculoskeletal
disorders (eg, arthralgia and myalgia) were frequently
reported adverse events. Injection site reactions were generally mild or moderate, although 1 patient in the 40 mg
þ DTIC arm had grade 4 (disabling) injection site pain
at 1 of the abdominal injection sites, and 2 patients in
each of the 3 PF-3512676 containing arms had grade 3
(severe) injection site reactions (erythema, pain, swelling,
and/or induration). One patient in the 40-mg þ DTIC
arm had an injection reaction of grade 2 cellulitis, with a
SAE of febrile neutropenia. Grade 3 or 4 injection site
reactions were observed in 2 patients each in the 10-mg
and 40-mg arms and in 3 patients in the 40-mg þ DTIC
arm.
Increasing the PF-3512676 dose from 10 mg to
40 mg did not markedly increase the incidence or severity
of adverse events. Grade 3 and 4 hematologic events of

in the DTIC arm. One (2%) patient in the 10-mg and 0
patients in the 40-mg arm achieved an objective response.
Clinical benefit (best response of CR or PR or SD, with
no minimum duration defined for SD) was achieved by 8
(17%) patients in the 10-mg arm, 9 (20%) patients in the
40-mg arm, 15 (33%) patients in the 40-mg þ DTIC
arm, and 15 (38%) patients in the DTIC arm.
Although not a prospectively defined endpoint, median survival was noted to be 9.4 months in the 10-mg
arm, 8.4 months in the 40-mg arm, 9.0 months in the 40mg þ DTIC arm, and 11.6 months in the DTIC arm.
Median times to progression were 2.0 months (0 censored) in the 10-mg arm, 2.1 months (4 censored) in the
40-mg arm, 2.1 months (3 censored) in the 40-mg þ
DTIC arm, and 2.2 months (7 censored) in the DTIC
arm. Response rates, overall survival, and time to progression were not different between the 4 arms, and
are summarized in Table 3. The overall survival curves in
the randomized and treated population are shown in
Figure 1. The small number of patients that showed partial responses, coupled with the censoring of a large proportion of them, prevented any meaningful estimation of
response duration.

Pharmacokinetics
PF-3512676 concentrations were measured in plasma
samples obtained predose, and 0.5, 4, 6 to 10, and
24 hours postdose. A group-mean peak plasma concentration, exposure (AUC0-last), half-life, and time to peak
plasma concentration were calculated from the first week
of chemotherapy on Cycle 1 and second week of chemotherapy on Cycle 3 for each PF-3512676 treatment arm.
Mean peak plasma concentrations occurred 1 to 4 hours
after dosing in all 3 treatment arms. Mean AUC0-last
ranged from 436,680 pg/hours/mL (10-mg arm, Cycle 1,
Week 1) to 4,774,608 pg/hours/mL (40-mg þ DTIC
arm, Cycle 3, Week 1). The T1=2 values at Week 3 in the 3
PF-3512676 arms appeared to be dose related; the values
ranged from 15.1 hours in the 10-mg arm to 29.1 and
28.9 hours in the 40-mg and 40-mg þ DTIC arms,
respectively. The complete data are shown in Table 4.

Pharmacodynamic Cytokine Assays
An exploratory objective of this study was to evaluate the
effects of PF-3512676 on serum concentrations of

selected cytokines and acute phase proteins such as CRP,
IFN-a, IL-12p40, IL-6, IP-10, and MCP-1. For comparison, serum samples were also collected at similar time
points from some patients in the DTIC study arm during
the same cycles. Mean serum concentrations of immunologic markers are presented for Cycle 1, Week 1 in Figure
2. These results demonstrate marked interpatient variability in serum concentrations of these markers. Nonetheless,
the most significant finding was the approximate 2-8–fold
increases (from baseline) in mean serum MCP-1, and 570–fold increases (from baseline) in mean serum IP-10
concentrations detectable between 8 and 24 hours in all
study arms receiving PF-3512676 injections in Cycle 1
and Cycle 3. These data are shown in Figure 2. No
changes in circulating levels of IFN-a were observed. No
clear or consistent association was apparent for the pharmacodynamic parameters and tumor response.

DISCUSSION
Bacterial DNA contains a significantly higher frequency
of CpG dinucleotides (CpG motifs) that are unmethylated, whereas in mammalian DNA, CpG dinucleotides
3950

are underrepresented and predominantly methylated.
Unmethylated CpG motifs are recognized as a danger signal by the innate immune system of mammals, and an
immune response is induced when these sequences are
encountered.10,11 These immunostimulatory activities of
bacterial unmethylated CpG DNA can also be achieved
with synthetic CpG ODNs. Engagement of TLR9 by
CpG ODN motifs induces cell signaling and subsequently triggers a proinflammatory cytokine response and
a predominantly Th1-type immune response. The resulting generation of cytokines like IFN-a and IL-12 places
CpG ODNs at the interface between innate and adaptive
immunity. CpG ODN–induced innate and adaptive
immune responses can result in protection in various
mouse tumor models,12-15 and have been shown to produce a potent adjuvant effect in models of murine vaccination against infectious disease and cancer. The rationale
for the current study was based on the activity of CpG
ODNs in binding to TLR9 on pDCs and B cells, resulting
in generation of IFN-a and IL-12, as well as preclinical
work showing the antitumor synergy of CpG ODNs and
chemotherapy. Recruitment and activation of NK cells,
neutrophils, and macrophages would lead to polarized T

helper 1–type responses, felt to be essential for achieving
an antitumor effect. The conduct of this study was also
supported by the single-agent activity seen for PF3512676 in melanoma.17 CpG ODNs have been shown
in animal models to have a potent adjuvant effect when
combined with various vaccines, and in melanoma
patients,18,19 the addition of the same ODN used in the
current trial to a peptide vaccine with adjuvant significantly amplified the yield of antigen-specific T cells.20 In
vitro, and in vivo using murine xenograft models, ODNs
have a direct antitumor effect on acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and
lymphomas.21 ODNs have also been shown to potentiate
the effects of radiation therapy in murine tumor models.22
Preliminary results from trials in patients with CLL, lung
cancer, and melanoma also suggested that ODN alone at
tolerable doses had antitumor activity.23
In the randomized phase 2 trial of this report, it was
hypothesized that a type-B CpG ODN with a phosphorothioate backbone, PF-3512676, would add to the objective response rate of DTIC as the reference arm. If
sufficient evidence had been demonstrated in the phase 2
portion of the trial that either monotherapy arm or the
combination arm was superior to DTIC alone, the best
arm with a response rate >15% would have been chosen
to take to a larger randomized phase 3 study.
In the current trial, PF-3512676 was felt to be well
tolerated. The most frequently reported adverse events
were injection site reactions or systemic reactions. Increasing the PF-3512676 dose from 10 mg to 40 mg moderately increased the incidence of these reactions,
particularly pyrexia, rigors, and headache.
The unconfirmed ORR (PR þ CR), was greatest in
the 40-mg þ DTIC arm (7 patients [16%]), compared
with 3 (8%) patients in the DTIC arm, 1 (2%) patient in
the 10-mg arm, and 0 patients in the 40-mg arm. However, only 4 (9%) patients in the 40-mg þ DTIC arm had
a confirmed objective response. Clinical benefit was similar between the DTIC and DTIC þ 40-mg arms, and
lower in the 10- and 40-mg arms.
There was no difference in overall survival between
the arms; median survival time was 9.0 months in the 40mg þ DTIC arm. Median time to progression was also
similar in all arms. The historical objective response rate
to DTIC is 8% to 15%;.24 Taking into consideration the
ORR of 16% in the 40-mg þ DTIC arm and the similar

time to progression and survival data for all 4 arms, the
results of the trial did not support continuation to the
phase 3 portion of the study. Why was the combination of
DTIC and PF-3512676 not superior to DTIC alone? The
higher dose of PF-3512676 was chosen because it was the
highest dose that could be practically tolerated over multiple cycles, and was physiologically active, producing flulike symptoms of fatigue and fever in most patients, and
increased levels of molecules induced by IFN, such as IP-10
and MCP-1, as shown in Figure 2. An explanation for the
lack of significant antitumor activity is that in the advanced
stage of melanoma (>90% of patients were stage IV),
immune therapy may be ineffective, as a result of tumorinduced suppression of an effective antitumor response. An
additional issue is that DTIC is a poorly effective agent in
melanoma, and a more effective chemotherapy regimen
may have facilitated a better antitumor effect by the CgG
ODN. In addition, the distribution of TLR9 expression in
humans and mice is very different, with murine TLR9
highly expressed on both the plasmacytoid and myeloid
subsets of dendritic cells, but present only on plasmacytoid
dendritic cells in humans.10,11 Therefore, the promising
level of murine antitumor activity for CpG ODN12-15 may
not be translatable to patients. Nonetheless, there are clinical
data from small phase 1 and 2 trials suggesting that immune
stimulatory effects of CpG ODN are intact in chemotherapy-treated patients, and that additive effects of the 2 agents
3952

are seen, particularly in nonsmall-cell lung cancer, where a
19% response rate was observed in a trial of chemotherapy
plus ODN, compared with 11% for chemotherapy alone.25
However, when those promising data were tested in a recent
phase 3 clinical trial in nonsmall-cell lung cancer that compared chemotherapy with ODN to chemotherapy alone, no
benefit was shown for the combination arm. Nonetheless,
some trials of immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy have demonstrated evidence of additive activity for the
combination. In a recent randomized phase 2 trial, anti–
CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab alone or ipilimumab plus
DTIC was evaluated in 72 patients with stage IV melanoma, for whom the primary endpoints were the overall
response rate and median survival.26 Median survival in the
combination arm was 14.8 months, compared with 11.3
months in the ipilimumab-alone arm, provoking a large
phase 3 trial of DTIC with ipilimumab compared with
DTIC alone. Clinical trials of biologic agent IFN-a added
to DTIC, however, showed no difference in survival compared with chemotherapy alone,24 and multiple trials of IL2 and chemotherapy have failed to show an improvement in
survival compared with chemotherapy despite achieving
high response rates.27 It is possible that unless immune
stimulants combined with chemotherapy include agents
with activity against immunosuppressive T regulatory cells
and myeloid suppressor cells, no further increment of benefit will be seen.

In contrast, CpG ODNs apparently have a potent
adjuvant effect when administered locally at the site of
vaccination both in animal models18,19 and in patients
with melanoma.20 The adaptive immune effects and
clinical benefit of CpG ODN in humans may only be
local, as shown in murine experiments and a clinical trial
in patients with gliomas in which CpG ODNs were
directly injected into tumors, resulting in significant
regression of disease.12,21 The promising potentiation of
chemotherapy-induced and radiation effects in murine
models may not be replicated in patients with established tumors unless direct effects on tumor cells are
required for an antitumor effect, as seen for CLL, ALL,
and lymphomas,21 but not for solid tumors. Another
unexplored issue is that there are 3 classes of CpG
ODNs: A, B (of which PF-3512676 is a member), and
C.28 It is possible that the antitumor activity of C-class
CpG ODNs in patients may be greater than that of the
B-class ODNs, and that PF-3512676 was not an optimal ODN choice. It is also possible that the greatest
utility of the CpG ODNs in humans may be as a vaccine adjuvant in infectious and neoplastic diseases, or as
a local treatment option. Furthermore, studies of TLR9
agonists could focus on a patient population at an earlier
stage of disease, or on combination therapies with TLR9
agonists and chemotherapy that reverse tumor-mediated
immune suppression, potentially allowing a greater antitumor effect. The direct depletion of regulatory T cells
might also benefit patients receiving a TLR9 agonist like
PF-3512676. Additional trials are ongoing to investigate
the potential for CpG ODN as an anticancer therapy in
combination with anti–CTLA-4 antibody and to establish its role as a vaccine adjuvant for cancer
immunization.
