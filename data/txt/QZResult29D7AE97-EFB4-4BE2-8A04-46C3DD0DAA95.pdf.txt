ABSTRACT
Esophageal cancer is the sixth most common cause of cancer-related deaths
worldwide. Novel therapeutic intervention is urgently needed for this deadly disease.
The functional role of PI3K/AKT pathway in esophageal cancer is little known.
In this study, our results from 49 pairs of human esophageal tumor and normal
specimens demonstrated that AKT was constitutively active in the majority (75.5%)
of esophageal tumors compared with corresponding normal tissues. Inhibition of the
PI3K/AKT pathway with specific inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, significantly
reduced Bcl-xL expression, induced caspase-3-dependent apoptosis, and repressed
cell proliferation and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo without obvious toxic effects.
Moreover, significantly higher expression level of p-AKT was observed in fluorouracil
(5-FU)-resistant esophageal cancer cells. Inactivation of PI3K/AKT pathway markedly
increased the sensitivity and even reversed acquired resistance of esophageal cancer
cells to chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro. More importantly, the resistance of tumor
xenografts derived from esophageal cancer cells with acquired 5-FU resistance to
chemotherapeutic drugs was significantly abrogated by wortmannin treatment in
animals. In summary, our data support PI3K/AKT as a valid therapeutic target and
strongly suggest that PI3K/AKT inhibitors used in conjunction with conventional
chemotherapy may be a potentially useful therapeutic strategy in treating esophageal
cancer patients.

INTRODUCTION

rarely exceeds 40% [3]. Local recurrence after initial
treatment is still the major cause of treatment failure in the
patients [4, 5]. Thus, a detailed study of esophageal cancer
including identification and better understanding of the
key signaling pathways responsible for development and
progression of this disease is urgently needed to develop
new treatment strategies.
Genetic abnormalities of the phosphatidylinositil-3kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway are common in human

Esophageal cancer is the 8th most common cancer
in the world. Although the incidence rate of esophageal
cancer pales in comparison with that of cancers of breast,
prostate, colon, and lung, it has a very high lethality rate,
with more than 400,000 deaths (i.e. around 90% of the
incidence of the disease) reported in 2012 [1, 2]. The

cancer, and there is increasing evidence of PI3K/AKT
being involved in the development of many types of
cancers [6, 7], thus making PI3K/AKT and its downstream
pathways promising targets for therapeutic intervention [8,
9]. However, the role of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in
esophageal tumorigenesis is not fully understood and the
feasibility of targeting PI3K/AKT as a potential treatment
for esophageal cancer has not been elucidated. Recent
immunohistochemical studies including ours showed that
PI3K/AKT is constitutively activated in human esophageal
tumor tissues [10], but studies that evaluate PI3K/AKT
signaling based on matched tumor and normal tissues are
limited. More importantly, there is currently very little in
vitro or in vivo experimental data on the effects of PI3K/
AKT inhibition on esophageal cancer.
Intrinsic
and
acquired
resistance
to
chemotherapeutic drugs in human cancer may lead to poor
treatment response or cancer recurrence. Fluorouracil (5FU) is a key chemotherapy drug for esophageal cancer.
We recently established 5-FU-resistant (FR) cell lines
by treating esophageal cancer cells with increasing
concentration of 5-FU for over one year [11], and here
we observed significantly increased expression of
phosphorylated-AKT (p-AKT), the activated form of
AKT, in the FR cells. In the present study, we aim to
demonstrate, the significance of PI3K/AKT activation in
esophageal cancer by examining the p-AKT expression
in paired clinical tumor and normal specimens, and to

determine the effects of specific inhibitors of PI3K/AKT
on caspase-3-dependent cancer cell apoptosis, esophageal
tumor growth and chemoresistance by in vitro experiments
and in vivo tumorigenesis model.

RESULTS
PI3K/AKT pathway is constitutively activated in
esophageal tumors compared with paired normal
tissues
To study whether the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway
is clinically relevant in esophageal cancer, the expression
levels of p-AKT and total AKT were determined in 49
pairs of human esophageal tumor and adjacent normal
tissues (Figure 1A). Compared with the corresponding
normal tissues, a higher p-AKT/total AKT ratio was
observed in the majority of primary esophageal tumors
studied (37 of 49; 75.5%) (Figure 1B). As seen in Figure
1C, the mean p-AKT/total AKT ratio in the tumor tissues
was about 2-fold higher than that in the paired normal
tissues (0.40 ± 0.32 versus 0.21 ± 0.17; P < 0.001).
These data highlighted the clinical relevance of the PI3K/
AKT pathway and its potential as therapeutic target in
esophageal cancer.

and total AKT were determined in 49 pairs of esophageal tumor and matched normal tissues by Western blot, and results of 6 representative

markedly abrogated these effects (Figure 2C). These data
indicated that wortmannin and LY294002 exerted dosedependent inhibitory effects on the PI3K/AKT pathway

of 59.2% and 77.3% for KYSE150 and KYSE270

xenografts showed that wortmannin treatment resulted
in inactivation of PI3K/AKT pathway and induction

levels of p-AKT and p-GSK3β, as well as increased
cleaved caspase-3. Notably, wortmannin treatment had
a better response in suppressing growth of KYSE270

resistance and lowered the proliferation rate (Figure 7B).
Furthermore, the FR cell lines which were resistant to
5-FU-induced apoptosis were rendered apoptotic by the
addition of wortmannin or LY294002, as evidenced by
the increase in sub-G1 population and cleaved caspase-3
expression (Figure 7C-D). More importantly, our in vivo
experiments showed that the resistance of KYSE410FR
tumor xenografts to 5-FU treatment in nude mice was
markedly abrogated by wortmannin treatment (Figure
7E). Taken together, the above findings indicated that
blockade of PI3K/AKT can reverse acquired resistance of
FR esophageal cancer cells to chemotherapy drugs.

Chemotherapy is now widely used in clinical
cancer treatment but development of chemoresistance
can compromise treatment or even result in recurrence
of the disease. The contribution of chemoresistance to
low survival rate of human cancer patients has therefore
prompted studies that explore the underlying mechanisms.
Here, we found increased constitutive activity of the PI3K/
AKT signaling pathway in esophageal cancer cells with
acquired resistance to 5-FU. Several in vitro studies have
shown that inhibition of PI3K/AKT pathway can sensitize
a variety of other types of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic
drugs [23, 24], but the effects of specific inhibitors of
PI3K/AKT on esophageal cancer chemoresistance have
not been reported. Our current findings showed for the
first time that wortmannin and LY294002 significantly
enhanced the sensitivity of parental esophageal cancer
cells and chemoresistant sublines to chemotherapeutic
drugs not only in vitro, but also in xenografted animal
models (Figures 6-7), which strongly suggest that
combining PI3K/AKT inhibitors and conventional
chemotherapeutic drugs may be a potentially useful
therapeutic strategy in treating esophageal cancer patients,
particularly as upfront therapy before tumors have a
chance to develop chemoresistance. This notion is further
corroborated by Yoshioka et al.’s multivariate analysis
of paired esophageal tumor samples obtained before and
after chemotherapy, which shows that p-AKT expression
is the only independent predictor of poor prognosis in
esophageal cancer patients with chemotherapy [25].
Taken together, we have demonstrated the
significance of PI3K/AKT pathway in malignant
progression of esophageal cancer, and have provided
the first evidence that PI3K/AKT inhibitors can increase
the sensitivity and even reverse acquired resistance of
esophageal cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs.
Genetic mutations in the PI3K/AKT pathway are common
in human cancer [26]. A recent study showed that patients
with gynecologic and breast cancer that have PIK3CA
mutations are more responsive to treatment with PI3K/
AKT/mTOR inhibitors than patients without mutations
[21]. The effects of PI3K/AKT inhibitors on esophageal
cancer with genetic variations in the PI3K/AKT pathway
warrant further investigation.

DISCUSSION
PI3K is a lipid kinase that generates second
messenger lipid phosphatidylinositol (3-5)-triphosphate
(PIP3), which recruits and activates a number of proteins
including AKT. AKT encodes a serine/threonine kinase,
and is activated through phosphorylation, which mediates
the activation of target genes, therefore regulating cell
proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, invasion and
metastasis. Constitutively activated PI3K/AKT pathway
is a common event in many types of cancer, and is
associated with poor prognosis and reduced survival [6,
7, 12]. In esophageal cancer, the association of genetic
variants of AKT with chemoradiotherapy response and
survival has been reported [13]. Our previous studies
demonstrated constitutive activation of the PI3K/AKT
pathway in esophageal tumor tissues and its regulation by
Id1 (inhibitor of differentiation or DNA binding) [10, 14].
In this study, Western blot analysis of clinical esophageal
tumor specimens demonstrated markedly higher p-AKT
expression in tumor tissues compared with paired normal
tissues.
The significance of PI3K/AKT and its potential
as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment have been
investigated in several types of human cancer in
preclinical studies, including renal cancer [15], lung
cancer [16], breast cancer [17], glioblastoma [18], and
neuroblastoma [19]. More importantly, the data from
phase I clinical trial suggested that treatment of the
cancer patients with PI3K inhibitors was associated with
prolonged stable disease, and phase II trials are in progress
[20, 21]. Although overexpression of PTEN (phosphatase
and tensin homolog), which acts as a lipid phosphatase
to dephosphorylates PIP3 and therefore negatively
regulates PI3K/AKT pathway, was found to suppress
esophageal cancer cell growth [22], experimental data
on direct targeting of PI3K/AKT in the preclinical setting
are limited. Our in vitro and in vivo results showed that
specific inhibitors of PI3K/AKT inhibited proliferation
and promoted apoptosis of esophageal cancer cells in a
dose-dependent manner (Figures 2-5), thus indicating the
therapeutic potential of targeting PI3K/AKT in esophageal
cancer treatment.

Tumorigenicity in nude mice

Esophageal cancer patient tissue specimens

Female BALB/c nude mice aged 6-8 weeks were
maintained under standard conditions and cared for
according to the institutional guidelines for animal care.
The esophageal cancer cells suspended in a 1:1 mixture of
PBS/Matrigel were subcutaneously injected into the flank
of mice. The mice were randomized into treatment and
control groups when the tumors reached ~5 mm diameter.
The treatment groups received wortmannin (0.3 mg/kg
or 0.6 mg/kg), 5-FU (20 mg/kg) or cisplatin (2 mg/kg)
through intraperitoneal injection twice weekly, whereas
the control groups received the vehicle only. Additional
treatment groups were given wortmannin (0.3 mg/kg)
combined with 5-FU (20 mg/kg) or cisplatin (2 mg/kg).
The body weight of mice was monitored weekly during
the experiments to evaluate overall health. Tumor size was
measured with calipers every three days and tumor volume
was calculated using the equation V= (length x width2) /2.
Tumors, together with pieces of liver, lung, and kidney,
were collected at the end of experiments for further
analyses. All the animal experiments were approved by
the Committee on the Use of Live Animals in Teaching
and Research of the University of Hong Kong.

Fresh human esophageal tumor and the
corresponding adjacent non-neoplastic esophageal tissues
were collected with informed consent and Institutional
Review Board approval from 49 patients undergoing
surgical resection of primary esophageal tumor at Queen
Mary Hospital in Hong Kong from 2011 to 2014, and at
the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhengzhou University in
Zhengzhou from 2008 to 2010. All specimens were snapfrozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80ºC.
