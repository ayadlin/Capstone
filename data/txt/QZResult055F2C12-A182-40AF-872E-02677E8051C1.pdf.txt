ABSTRACT
Androgen deprivation therapy induces apoptosis or cell cycle arrest in prostate
cancer (PCa) cells. Here we set out to analyze whether MCL1, a known mediator of
chemotherapy resistance regulates the cellular response to androgen withdrawal.
Analysis of MCL1 protein and mRNA expression in PCa tissue and primary cell culture
specimens of luminal and basal origin, respectively, reveals higher expression in
cancerous tissue compared to benign origin. Using PCa cellular models in vitro and
in vivo we show that MCL1 expression is upregulated in androgen-deprived PCa cells.
Regulation of MCL1 through the AR signaling axis is indirectly mediated via a cell
cycle-dependent mechanism. Using constructs downregulating or overexpressing
MCL1 we demonstrate that expression of MCL1 prevents induction of apoptosis when
PCa cells are grown under steroid-deprived conditions. The BH3-mimetic Obatoclax
induces apoptosis and decreases MCL1 expression in androgen-sensitive PCa cells,
while castration-resistant PCa cells are less sensitive and react with an upregulation of
MCL1 expression. Synergistic effects of Obatoclax with androgen receptor inactivation
can be observed. Moreover, clonogenicity of primary basal PCa cells is efficiently
inhibited by Obatoclax. Altogether, our results suggest that MCL1 is a key molecule
deciding over the fate of PCa cells upon inactivation of androgen receptor signaling.

INTRODUCTION

within 12 to 33 months to a more aggressive phenotype
termed castration-resistant PCa (CRPCa) concurrent with
a reactivation of the AR signaling axis. ADT induces
shrinkage of the tumor or stops its growth. On the cellular
level, the consequences of ADT on malignant prostate
epithelial cells are induction of apoptosis or cell cycle
arrest in G1 phase [2]. Obviously, cells reacting with a
cell cycle arrest and unable to induce apoptosis may be at
the basis of development of castration resistance. Hence,
in order to improve the efficiency of ADT, combination
therapies are warranted where the ADT-additive therapy
targets the G1 cell cycle-arrested PCa cells.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a firstline therapy for locally advanced and metastatic prostate
cancer (PCa). This includes the use of Gonadotropinreleasing hormone (Luteinizing-hormone releasing
hormone) agonists and antagonists suppressing the
production of testosterone, and non-steroidal antiandrogens (e.g. Bicalutamide (CasodexTM)) that inhibit
activation of the androgen receptor (AR) by competing
with its natural ligand dihydrotestosterone [1]. Despite
initial success, most patients experience progression

We hypothesized that the molecular difference
between the apoptosis- and cell cycle arrest- inducing
effects of ADT could be found among members of the
BCL2 protein family, which act as a rheostat regulating the
balance between survival and apoptosis [3]. Pro-apoptotic
proteins of this family commit cells to programmed death
by permeabilising the outer mitochondrial membrane
followed by cytochrome C release. MCL1 is a pro-survival
member of the BCL2 family and prevents activation of
pro-apoptotic BCL2-homology (BH)3-only proteins and
the effector BAK1 [4]. MCL1 expression is induced by
a number of cytokines and growth factors and is tightly
regulated at transcriptional, post-transcriptional and posttranslational levels [5]. High protein expression levels and
somatic copy-number amplifications of the MCL1 gene
have been found in several cancer types [6]. MCL1 has
superior apoptosis-inhibitory functions compared to other
BCL2 family members [7]. It confers multi-drug resistance
[8] and, moreover, resistance to ABT-737, a BH3-mimetic
inhibiting anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members with the
exception of MCL1 [9]. In contrast, Obatoclax (GX15070), which also targets MCL1, can overcome ABT-737mediated resistance [10]. Obatoclax has been assessed in
clinical studies in combinatorial approaches with existing
therapies [11–13].
Here, we demonstrate that high expression of MCL1
promotes the survival of steroid-deprived and cell cyclearrested PCa cells. Our data suggests that inhibition of
MCL1 could improve currently used ADT protocols by
targeting the G1 phase-arrested cell population.

amplifying cells (TA, CD49bhi) based on their potential
to attach to type I collagen. Consequently, stem/tumorinitiating cells (SC/TIC) were isolated from the TA
population by making use of their CD133 expression [15].
MCL1 mRNA expression was then measured by qRT-PCR
on isolated cell populations. We found that MCL1 mRNA
is increasingly expressed in malignant compared to benign
samples in SC/TIC and TA populations. Intriguingly, TIC
showed highest increase of MCL1 mRNA expression
levels compared to benign SC, which could point to
increased apoptotic resistance of TIC. Altogether, this
showed that MCL1 expression is increased in basal and
luminal prostatic compartments of cancerous compared to
benign origin.

Activation of the AR signaling axis leads to
decreased MCL1 expression levels
Next, we analyzed the role of AR signaling and
androgen deprivation on MCL1 expression levels using
established cell culture models of PCa. Surprisingly,
AR inactivation through steroid deprivation (using 10%
charcoal-stripped serum, CSS) caused an increase of
MCL1 in LNCaP and to a lesser extent in VCaP cells
compared to normal growth conditions (10 % fetal calf
serum, FCS) (Fig. 2A). This effect was lost in LNCaPabl, a derivative of the LNCaP cell line that has adapted
to steroid-deprived conditions but has retained androgen
sensitivity [16]. On the other hand, treatment with the
synthetic androgen R1881 for 48 h decreased MCL1
expression in a concentration-dependent manner in the
androgen-sensitive cell lines LNCaP, LNCaP-abl and
VCaP. MCL1 expression in the AR-negative cell lines
PC-3 and LNCaP-IL-6+ [17] did not decrease upon
R1881 treatment. To confirm the involvement of AR in
the regulation of MCL1, AR activity was inhibited by
the anti-androgen Bicalutamide (Fig. 2B) or by knocking
down its expression by means of siRNA specific for AR
(Fig. 2C). In both cases decreased MCL1 expression
through the action of R1881 could be antagonized, while
AR-negative PC-3 were unaffected by Bicalutamide
treatment. R1881 treatment was able to partly counteract
the siRNA-mediated downregulation of AR. Analysis of
explants from an in vivo experiment, where LNCaP were
xenografted subcutaneously in male nude BALB/c mice,
showed increased staining for MCL1 when animals were
castrated compared to intact mice (Fig. 2D). Similarly,
when intact animals bearing LNCaP or castrated animals
bearing LNCaP-abl xenografts received injections with
oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) targeting AR, increased
expression levels of MCL1 were observable (Fig. 2E).
To address the question whether androgenic
repression of MCL1 is a transcriptional or posttranslational mechanism, we measured MCL1 mRNA
levels 48 h after treatment with R1881 (Fig. 2F) and

RESULTS
Increased expression of MCL1 in malignant
compared to benign areas in prostate tissue
specimens
In order to assess expression of MCL1 in prostatic
tissue and to validate MCL1 as a potential target for
treatment of PCa we performed immunohistochemistry
on tissue specimens from treatment-naïve prostate cancer
(tnPCa) patients who underwent radical prostatectomy
(Fig. 1A). A significantly increased staining score
of cytoplasm-localized MCL1 could be observed in
malignant compared to adjacent benign areas (Fig.
1A, detail views; Fig. 1B, left). However, we could not
observe a positive correlation of MCL1 expression with
Gleason score (Fig. 1B, right). Additionally, we analyzed
MCL1 mRNA expression in primary basal, androgenindependent [14] cells grown from benign and malignant
biopsies from tnPCa gained after radical prostatectomy
(Fig. 1C). To determine whether MCL1 is differentially
expressed with increasing cell differentiation, we
separated committed basal (CB, CD49blo) from transit

Activation of the AR signaling axis through R1881 decreases MCL1 protein expression. PCa cell lines were steroid-deprived for ≥48 h
using medium supplemented with 10% CSS and then treated for additional 48 h in medium supplemented with 10% FCS or in medium
supplemented with 10% CSS and increasing concentrations of R1881 or vehicle (EtOH), as indicated. (B) Inhibition of AR by Bicalutamide
counteracts the effects of R1881 on MCL1 expression. LNCaP and PC-3 were steroid-deprived for ≥48 h using medium supplemented
with 10% CSS and then treated for additional 48 h in medium supplemented with 10% CSS and 1 nM R1881 or vehicle (EtOH) with 10
or 20 µM Bicalutamide (Bic) or vehicle (DMSO), as indicated. (C) Downregulation of AR by siRNA counteracts the effects of R1881 on
MCL1 expression. LNCaP were steroid-deprived for ≥48 h using medium supplemented with 10% CSS and then transfected with 30 nM
siRNA targeting AR (siAR) or control siRNA (siCont) and treated with 1 nM R1881 or vehicle (EtOH) for 48 h, as indicated. (D) MCL1
expression is increased in LNCaP xenografts grown in castrated mice. LNCaP were implanted subcutaneously in both flanks of BALB/c nu/
nu mice. When tumors became palpable animals were castrated (6 animals, 12 tumors) or left intact (6 animals, 12 tumors). Tumors were
explanted four weeks after castration and immunohistochemistry for MCL1 was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections.
Representative stainings for MCL1 of LNCaP xenografts from intact and castrated mice are shown. Statistical analysis of MCL1 intensities
of intact vs. castrated animals showed mean intensity (-/+ SD) of 1.92 (-/+ 0.29) vs. 2.25 (-/+ 0.62); n=12; p=0.1026, respectively. (E)
MCL1 expression is increased in LNCaP and LNCaP-abl xenografts after downregulation of AR by oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN). LNCaP
and LNCaP-abl were injected subcutaneously in intact or castrated BALB/c nu/nu mice, respectively. When tumors became palpable
intraperitoneal injections with 5 mg/kg control oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN_Cont, n=6) or 5 mg/kg ODN targeting the AR (ODN_AR,
n=6) were performed three times in the first week and twice in the following three weeks. After four weeks under this treatment protein
was extracted from an explanted tumor from animals bearing LNCaP or LNCaP-abl xenografts transduced with either ODN_Cont or
ODN_AR. (A-C, E) Protein expression was determined by immunoblotting using antibodies for AR, MCL1 and GAPDH, as indicated.

with control ODN (ODN_Cont) or AR ODN. (H) Androgenic regulation of MCL1 is significantly apparent after 16 h of incubation with
R1881. LNCaP were steroid-deprived for ≥48 h using medium supplemented with 10% CSS and then treated in medium supplemented
with 10% CSS and increasing concentrations of 1 or 10 nM R1881 or vehicle (EtOH) for different time points, as indicated. (F-H) MCL1

protein levels after knock-down of three known E3ligases APC/CCDC20, SCFFBXW7 and HUWE1 [18] (Fig.
S1A). MCL1 mRNA was decreased in a dose-dependent
manner through R1881 in LNCaP, while AR-negative
PC-3 cells were unaffected. On the other hand, none of
the three E3-ligases was able to antagonize the effect
of R1881 on MCL1 protein expression. Similarly, the
increased MCL1 protein expression seen in LNCaP and
LNCaP-abl xenografts after knock-down of AR (Fig. 2E)
was mediated by increased MCL1 mRNA expression
(Fig. 2G). Time course experiments following addition
of R1881 showed that androgenic repression of MCL1
was significant after 16 h at mRNA levels (Fig. 2H) and
after 24 h at the protein level (Fig. S1B). Altogether, we
concluded that androgenic signaling through the AR axis
is able to repress MCL1 protein and mRNA expression.

2H), we hypothesized that this regulation is not directly
mediated by AR but rather indirectly by another ARstimulated transcription factor. Indeed, in a genome-wide
chromatin-immunoprecipitation experiment coupled with
deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) in DuCaP cells [19] we were
not able to identify AR binding sites neighboring or within
the MCL1 gene, in contrast to other known AR targets
and, surprisingly, other BCL2 family members (Fig. 3A
and S2A).
Activated AR is a potent stimulator of cell cycle
progression from G1 to S phase in cancer cells through
the Cyclin D1/retinoblastoma/E2F1 axis [2]. Previously,
the cell cycle controller E2F1 was found to act as a
repressor of the MCL1 promoter [20]. Thus, AR might
repress MCL1 expression indirectly via E2F1 binding to
the MCL1 promoter. We confirmed E2F1-binding to the
MCL1 promoter in a ChIP experiment (Fig. 3B). E2F1
binding intensity to the MCL1 promoter was comparable
to the known E2F1 target CDC2, however only mildly
altered by the addition of R1881 implying that other cofactors regulating E2F1 transcriptional activity might be
involved.

Androgenic repression of MCL1 is a cell cycle
dependent mechanism
Since decreased expression of MCL1 at the mRNA
level was observable after 16 h R1881 treatment (Fig.

immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed on DuCaP cells treated for 1 h with 1 nM R1881 or vehicle (EtOH) using anti-AR antibodies
[19]. DNA bound to the precipitated AR complex was subjected to deep sequencing (ChIP-seq). The resulting gene list was searched
for members of the BCL2 family and results are depicted in the tables. The fold change indicates the enrichment of AR bound to the
respective sequence of R1881-treated versus vehicle-treated samples. Only the top fold regulation is shown. (B) The cell cycle regulatory
transcription factor E2F1 binds to the promoter region of the MCL1 gene. DuCaP and LNCaP cells were steroid-deprived for ≥48 h using

vehicle (EtOH). ChIP was performed using antibodies against E2F1 or control isotype IgG. DNA bound by E2F1 or control IgG was
quantified using primers against promoter regions of MCL1 or CDC2. Values were normalized to input taken before IP and are depicted as
2-dCt. (C) MCL1 is increasingly expressed in G1 and S phases, while decreased during G2/M. Various PCa cells were arrested in different

Next, we analyzed whether increased expression
levels of MCL1 through steroid-depletion could be
mediated via a G1 cell cycle arrest caused by the
inactivation of AR. To this end, we arrested PCa cells in
G1, G1/S and G2/M by serum withdrawal, thymidine excess
and nocodazole treatment, respectively (Fig. 3C and S2B).
Immunoblotting for MCL1 showed increased levels in
G1 and G1/S phases, while, as previously published [21],

decreased levels were detected after nocodazole treatment.
This effect was observable in AR-positive and –negative
cell lines showing that MCL1 levels could be increased
by G1 cell cycle arrest independently of the AR status. In
other words, androgenic regulation of MCL1 is an indirect
mechanism through AR inactivation and consequent G1
cell cycle arrest.

in LNCaP cells leads to increased apoptosis under steroid-deprived conditions. LNCaP cells were stably transduced with doxycyclineregulated short hairpin (sh) constructs targeting MCL1 (LNCaPdoxshMCL1) or Luciferase (control, LNCaPdoxshLuc). Both cell lines were
grown for 72h under full medium conditions (10% FCS) or under steroid-deprived conditions (10% CSS) and expression of sh constructs
was induced by addition of 1 µg/ml doxycycline, as depicted. (B) Overexpression of MCL1 rescues DuCaP and VCaP cells partially

full medium conditions (10% FCS) or under steroid-deprived conditions (10% CSS) and overexpression of MCL1 was induced by addition
of 1 µg/ml doxycycline. (A, B) Samples were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies against MCL1, cleaved PARP (cPARP, as an
indicator for apoptosis) and GAPDH. Representative immunoblots are shown. Numbers indicate relative ratios of densitometrical analysis

MCL1 protects PCa cells from undergoing
apoptosis under steroid-depleted conditions

expression levels, however, no significant induction of
apoptosis could be observed. Experiments with the ARnegative PC-3 and LNCaP-IL-6+ revealed that both
castration-resistant cell lines were refractory to apoptotic
induction by Obatoclax up to 10 µM (Fig. 5D and S3B).
Only a mild induction of apoptosis was observable when
Obatoclax concentration was increased up to 50 µM.
Interestingly, a dose-dependent increase of MCL1 through
Obatoclax treatment was detected. This suggests that
MCL1 is a targetable molecule in early stage PCa.

Subsequently, we analyzed the functional role of
MCL1 upregulation after AR inactivation and G1 cell
cycle arrest. LNCaP cells showed increased expression
of MCL1 under steroid-deprived conditions but only
a mild induction of apoptosis (Fig. 4A). To test the
hypothesis that upregulated MCL1 protects LNCaP
from undergoing apoptosis during steroid ablation
we made use of a doxycycline-inducible short hairpin
construct to downregulate MCL1 (shMCL1). While either
steroid deprivation, or MCL1 downregulation under
full growth conditions (10% FCS) induced apoptosis
only weakly, the combination of steroid deprivation and
MCL1 downregulation resulted in a strong induction of
apoptosis. In contrast, DuCaP and VCaP reacted with
a strong apoptotic response to steroid ablation but only
mild upregulation of MCL1 (Fig. 4B). Overexpression
of MCL1 using doxycycline-inducible overexpression of
MCL1 could partly rescue DuCaP and VCaP cells from
undergoing apoptosis when grown in CSS-containing
medium. In summary, our data shows that MCL1 acts as
a pro-survival molecule under steroid-ablated conditions
and, hence, targeting MCL1 might be a valuable addition
to a steroid deprivation protocol.

Obatoclax inhibits clonogenic potential of
primary basal tnPCa cells
Next, we tested whether primary basal, androgenindependent tnPCa cells would be sensitive to Obatoclax
treatment. As previously found in cell lines (Fig. 5A, B),
Obatoclax treatment led to a dose-dependent decrease
of MCL1 expression levels, when cells were kept under
full growth conditions (Fig. 6A). However, induction of
apoptosis as evidenced by cPARP was not observable.
Since increased MCL1 mRNA levels could be seen in
TIC compared to benign SC (Fig. 1C), we assessed the
reproductive integrity of tnPCa cells using clonogenic
assays (Fig. 6B). When cells were seeded at low density,
a decreased colony number was counted upon incubation
with 0.1 µM Obatoclax, while 1 µM was sufficient to
completely abolish clonogenic growth. This shows that
Obatoclax is effective in inhibiting the reproductive
integrity of primary basal tnPCa cells.

Induction of apoptosis after pharmacological
inhibition of MCL1 is dependent on the
progression state of PCa cells

DISCUSSION

Based on the concept that MCL1 protects cells from
undergoing apoptosis during steroid-deprived conditions,
we compared the cell death inducing properties of the
BH3-mimetic Obatoclax targeting MCL1 [10] under
various conditions: a) full growth (10% FCS), b) steroiddeprived (10% CSS), c) activation of AR signaling (10%
CSS + 1 nM R1881), d) inactivation of AR signaling by
the antagonist Bicalutamide (10% CSS + 1 nM R1881
+ 10 µM Bic). When Obatoclax was tested on LNCaP
and DuCaP cells, a concentration-dependent decrease
of MCL1 expression levels was observed (Fig. 5A). As
a consequence, apoptosis as evidenced by cPARP in
immunoblots and cleaved caspase 3/7 activity assays, was
increased. When tested under steroid-deprived conditions,
DuCaP cells were significantly more susceptible for
apoptosis induction by Obatoclax compared to full
growth conditions and the same trend could be observed
in LNCaP. Moreover, when tested under conditions where
AR was activated or inactivated through R1881 or R1881
and Bicalutamide, respectively, Obatoclax showed higher
efficiency when AR activity was blocked (Fig. 5B). The
same experiments were repeated with the LNCaP-abl
progression model (Fig. 5C and S3A). Immunoblots
showed that Obatoclax was still able to decrease MCL1

MCL1 has been proposed to have a unique role
among the pro-survival members of the BCL2 family
[5] that protect cells, and in particular cancer cells of
diverse origins, against various anti-cancer treatments.
For instance, high MCL1 expression in multiple myeloma
was correlated with recurrence after chemotherapy
and shorter survival [22] and mice bearing MCL1
overexpressing lymphomas were less sensitive to
cyclophosphamide treatment in vivo [23]. Previously,
we detected increased expression of MCL1 in docetaxel
(TaxotereTM)-resistant PCa cell lines, as well as in tissue
derived from PCa patients after neoadjuvant docetaxel
treatment [24]. Similarly, cisplatin-resistant cell lines of
various tissue origins showed high expression of MCL1
compared to their sensitive counterparts, while BCL2
and BCL2L1 were up-regulated at low frequency [25].
This shows that MCL1 is a major mediator of resistance
against chemotherapy. Here, we found that MCL1 is
also protecting against the cell death-inducing effects
of endocrine therapy. In fact, ADT-mediated G1 cell
cycle arrest could be interpreted as a partial resistance
mechanism to this therapy. Importantly, only surviving

cells (i.e. complete ADT-unresponsive or ADT-cell cycle
arrested cells) can be at the basis of a progression to a
castration-resistant disease. In consequence, targeting
MCL1 concurrent with an induction of apoptosis in the
ADT-mediated cell cycle-arrested PCa cell population
could prevent or delay development of castrationresistance.
The AR signaling axis and cell cycle progression are
two closely interlinked cellular processes that mutually
regulate each other [2]. After AR inactivation through
steroid deprivation, increased expression of MCL1 was
detectable in LNCaP, a cell line that reacts with G1 cell
cycle arrest to AR inhibition [16,26,27]. On the other hand,
a role for MCL1 as interacting partner of proliferating cell
nuclear antigen (PCNA) was proposed to inhibit cell cycle
progression in S phase [28]. During prolonged mitotic
arrest MCL1 was found to be degraded and to induce
apoptosis [21]. Furthermore, MCL1 promoted terminal
mitosis and differentiation involving p27KIP1 [29]. These
examples show that the mutual interactions of AR/cell
cycle/MCL1 signaling pathways in prostate cells result in
a highly complex network. It is however unclear whether
MCL1 is a regulator of cell cycle or whether MCL1
expression is regulated by cell cycle progression.
Pharmacological targeting of MCL1 by Obatoclax
was efficient in androgen withdrawal-sensitive LNCaP and

DuCaP, but inefficient in androgen withdrawal-insensitive
cells such as LNCaP-abl, PC-3 and LNCaP-IL-6+. This
loss of cell death-inducing activity of Obatoclax could
be due to decreased/absent expression of pro-apoptotic
BAK1 and BAX, which was previously demonstrated
in PC-3 cells [30]. Similar to our results in PCa cells, it
was found that endoplasmic reticulum stress induced
up-regulation of MCL1 and rendered melanoma cells
more sensitive to Obatoclax treatment [31]. Furthermore,
Obatoclax was able to induce apoptosis in primary
chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells previously resistant
to treatment with oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus
[32]. Sabutoclax, another BH3-mimetic targeting MCL1,
could sensitize prostate cancer cells to IL-24 mediated
cytotoxicity [33]. We deduce from these findings that
MCL1 inhibition is acting as a secondary trigger to induce
apoptosis in cells in which the primary treatment/trigger
is insufficient to cause this effect. This might also explain
the absent pro-apoptotic effect of Obatoclax on primary
PCa cells (Fig. 6A), where Obatoclax was used as a single
agent. Although the clinical development of Obatoclax has
been discontinued during this study [34], our results may
encourage further research into BCL2 family inhibitors,
and in particular in small molecules targeting MCL1. For
example, the recently identified hydroxyquinoline-derived
compound 9, shows selective MCL1 inhibitory function

Figure 7: Schematic conclusion. AR activity may be inhibited by androgen withdrawal (castration) and/or anti-androgens that

compete with the natural ligand dihydroxytestosterone (DHT) for binding. AR is an important controller of cell cycle progression. Upon
AR inactivation, PCa cells undergo apoptosis (upper arrow) or induce a G1 cell cycle arrest concurrent with cell survival (middle arrow)
and possible progression to CRPCa. Our data indicates that high expression of MCL1 protects PCa cells from undergoing apoptosis under
these conditions. Thus, combination therapies targeting AR and MCL1 could improve the current ADT protocol (lower arrow).

[35]. Possible clinical studies could select patients based
on results of a BH3 profiling assay, which measures
dependency of any or all anti-apoptotic BCL2 proteins for
cellular survival [35].
High MCL1 expression was found in various cancer
types [36]. In this study, we found a high expression of
MCL1 by immunohistochemistry in the tissue of tnPCa
patients (Fig. 1A, B), although we could not confirm a
correlation of MCL1 staining score with Gleason score, as
previously published [37]. Analysis of larger cohorts could
clarify this discrepancy. Possible mechanistic explanations
for increased MCL1 expression may be an amplification of
the MCL1 gene locus, as detected in other cancer types [6]
and cytokine and growth factor signaling resulting from
tissue inflammation known to increase MCL1 expression
[5]. Moreover, we detected also high MCL1 mRNA
expression in the TIC populations from tnPCa samples
(Fig. 1C). Similarly, MCL1 was found to be increasingly
expressed in the side population of non-small cell lung
cancer cell lines [38]. Intriguingly, inhibition of MCL1 by
Obatoclax was able to suppress self-renewal of those cells,
while we found that Obatoclax is also a potent inhibitor of
PCa clonogenicity (Fig. 6B). In addition, overexpression
of MCL1 was found to induce malignant transformation of
hematopoietic stem cells [23]. In summary, this shows that
MCL1 is increasingly expressed and plays a role in the
fate of cells in several compartments within PCa tissue and
indeed that it could play an important role in PCa tumor
initiation.
In conclusion, we demonstrate that MCL1 is an
important regulator of apoptosis in PCa cells. It is a
mediator of immediate steroid-deprivation resistance
in PCa cells that react with a G1 cell cycle arrest to AR
inactivation. Hence, our data provides a mechanistic
rationale for considering clinical studies, where MCL1
inhibiting therapies could be assessed for synergy with
the existing endocrine therapy for locally advanced and
metastatic, hormone-sensitive PCa patients (Fig. 7).

Animal experiments

[43]. In Innsbruck, the protocol had to be adapted to the
quantity of available tissue material derived from 3 mm
needle biopsies using the “outgrowth” method. In brief,
tissue from cancerous areas was collected by a needle
biopsy on fresh prostate tissue after prostatectomy.
Malignancy was confirmed by the uropathologist (G.S.)
on a section of the needle biopsy taken before in vitro
culture by routine diagnostics (haematoxylin and eosin,
and p63/alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase stainings).
Tissue was then cut into small wedges which were put
into a collagen I-coated T25 flask (Corning, Wiesbaden,
Germany). Wedges were kept in K-SFM medium (Life
Technologies, Vienna) supplemented with 2.5 µg/500 ml
EGF (Life Technologies), 25 mg/500 ml bovine pituitary
extract (Life Technologies), 2 ng/ml Leukemia inhibitory
factor (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt), 2 ng/ml stem
cell factor (Merck Millipore), 100 ng/ml cholera toxin
(SigmaAldrich, Vienna), 1 ng/ml Granulocyte macrophage
colony stimulating factor (Merck Millipore) and a mixture
of 1x antibiotics and –mycotics (Life Technologies) until
basal epithelial cells started to grow out from the wedges.
At this timepoint STO mouse embryonal fibroblasts
(ATCC, LCG Standards) previously irradiated with a dosis
of 60 Gy were added to epithelial cells to form a confluent
feeder layer. After one week tissue wedges were removed
and the described procedure with the removed wedges
was repeated twice more. Epithelial cells were grown until
80% confluence and passaged by trypsinization or seeded
into collagen I-coated (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg)
6-wells for experiments. Stem/Tumor-initiating (SC/TIC),
transit amplifying (TA) and committed basal (CB) cells
were isolated as previously described [43].

Animal protocols were approved by the Austrian
Federal Ministry for Education, Science and Culture
(BMWF-66.011/0130-II/10b/2009, BMWF-66.011/0116II/3b/2011). Xenografted tumors were grown by
subcutaneous implantation of a 0.1 ml suspension of
2x106 LNCaP cells mixed with 0.1 mL matrigel (BD
Biosciences) into both, the right and the left flanks of
anesthetized male nude mice (BALB/c/nu/nu, 4-6 weeks
old, Charles River Laboratories, Sulzfeld, Germany),
respectively. When the tumors became palpable, mice
were randomly divided into three different treatment
groups: ODN_Ctrl (5 mg/kg body weight), ODN_AR
(5 mg/kg body weight) and castration. Oligonucleotides
(ODNs) with 2`-O-(2-methoxy)ethyl modifications at
the 5` and 3`ends, respectively, and phosphorothioated
internucleotide linkages were purchased from GenXpress
(VWR, Vienna): ODN_AR 5’-*u*g*c*ugaagagtagc*a*g
*u*g-3` and ODN_Ctrl 5´-*a*g*a*ggcttgcacag*t*g*c*a3`(modified bases are indicated by an asterisk). Castration
was performed by orchiectomy of anesthetized mice.
ODNs were dissolved in 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride
solution and administered intraperitoneally at a final
concentration of 5 mg/kg mouse three times in the first
week and twice from week 2 to 4. Explanted tumors were
subdivided into two pieces and either frozen in liquid
nitrogen for Western blot analysis or fixed in buffered
formalin (4.5%) and embedded in paraffin for further
immunohistochemical staining and qRT-PCR. LNCaP-abl
cells (2x106 cells mixed with matrigel in a 1:1 ratio) were
injected into mice that received orchiectomy one week
before.

Cell cycle analysis

Clonogenic assay

The following treatments were performed to arrest
cells in different cell cycle phases: a) cycling: normal
growth conditions (medium containing 10% CSS for
LNCaP-abl or medium containing 10% FCS for all other
cell lines); b) CSS, G1: incubation with medium containing
10% CSS for 3 days; c) serum(-), G1: incubation with
medium without addition of serum for 3 days; d)
thymidine G1/S: incubation in normal growth medium
and 10 mM thymidine for 3 days; e) nocodazole, G2/M:
incubation in normal growth medium and 200 ng/ml
nocodazole for 18 hours. Cells were then harvested using
a cell scraper, fixed in 70:30 (v/v) ethanol:PBS at 4°C,
and digested with 50 µg/ml RNase A (Roche, Vienna) for
30 min at room temperature. Cells were stained with 50
µg/ml propidium iodide in PBS. Cell cycle distribution
was analyzed using the FL3-A channel of a FACSCalibur
(BD Biosciences) and visualized using FCS Express Flow
Cytometry 4 software (De Novo Software, Glendale, CA,
USA). Doublets were discriminated by plotting FL3-A
events against FL3-W and gating for singlets.

Primary basal cells were trypsinized, counted and
plated in full growth medium at a density of 30 cells/
cm² (equals 300 cells per 6-well) in triplicates. Irradiated
STO feeder cells were added to form a confluent layer
(as described above). Treatment with Obatoclax (0.1 –
10 µM) or DMSO (vehicle) was performed on the day
after seeding the cells. Medium was renewed every 2-3
days with new addition of Obatoclax and STO feeder
cells. Colonies were stained as previously described
[42]. Plating efficiency in DMSO treated samples was
calculated by the number of colonies divided by number of
cells seeded. Survival fraction was calculated by dividing
the number of colonies by the product of plating efficiency
and cells seeded.

sequence by T2A-sequence modified antisense primer. In
a second reaction the puromycin N-acetyl transferase (pac)
gene [48] was amplified using T2A-sequence modified
sense primer. The PCR-products of both reactions were
mixed and used as template for the third reaction using
the rtTA2-M2 sense- and the puromycin antisense primer.
The final 1.52 kb PCR product was purified, digested with
BamHI and NotI and cloned into the BamHI/NotI site of
pHR-SIN-CSGW (kindly provided by Mary Collins, UCL,
London, UK) exchanging the eGFP with the rtTA2-M2T2A-Puro cassette. The sequence verified plasmid was
used to generate lentiviral particles.
Lentiviral infection of target cells was performed as
described previously [45]. In brief, confluent HEK293T
were transfected with 1.5 µg lentiviral vector, 0.9
µg pSPAX2 packaging and 0.9 µg pMD-G VSV-Gpseudotyping plasmids (both vectors were kindly provided
by D. Trono, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland) by calcium
phosphate-based transfection. Target cells were infected
using 0.45 µm filtered virus containing cell culture
supernatant obtained at 48 and 72 hours after transfection
and supplemented with 1µg/ml polybrene (SigmaAldrich).
For conditional overexpression, cells were infected with
lentiviral vectors encoding sequences for rtTA2-M2,
followed by selection of puromycin (1µg/ml). Puromycin
resistant cells were superinfected with pHR-tetCMVhMCL1-ires-GFP [45].

The synthetic androgen R1881 (methyltrienolone)
was purchased from Organon (MSD, Vienna) and
dissolved in ethanol at stock concentrations of 0.1, 1, and
10 µM. Bicalutamide (CasodexTM) was obtained from
AstraZeneca (Macclesfield, UK) and dissolved in DMSO
at a stock concentration of 10 mM. Obatoclax mesylate
was purchased from Selleckchem.com (Eubio, Vienna)
and dissolved in DMSO at a stock concentration of 10
mM.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation
DuCaP and LNCaP were cultured for two days under
steroid deprived conditions using medium containing 10%
CSS. Cells were then treated in medium containing 10%
CSS with addition of 1 nM R1881 or vehicle (EtOH).
For chromatin immunoprecipitation the ChIPAb+E2F-1
kit from Merck Millipore was used following the
manufacturer´s instructions. QRT-PCR was performed on
immunoprecipitated DNA and inputs using the following
primer pairs: E2F-1 binding site on Mcl-1 promoter:
forward 5’-cgc ccc ttt ccc ctt tta tgg-3’ and reverse 5’- gaa
gac ccc gac tcc tta ctg g-3’ (derived from [20]). CDC2
primers were provided with the kit. Normalization was
done using the formula 2-dCt where dCt was calculated
as the difference between Ct(immunoprecipitation) and
Ct(input).

Statistical analysis
The statistical significances of differences between
treatment and control samples were calculated with
Student´s t-test using Graph Pad Prism. Comparison
groups are given in the figures and/or figure legends and
significances are encoded as follows: *p<0.05; **p<0.01;
***p<0.001. Statistical significances of differences in
Fig. 1B and 2D have been calculated with Mann-Whitney
U-test using Graph Pad Prism and p values are indicated
in the figure or figure legend.

Transfections, lentiviral infections and plasmids
PCa cell lines were transfected using Lipofectamine
2000 (Life Technologies) as previously described [41].
For downregulation of CDC20, FBXW7 and HUWE1
ON-TARGET plus smart pools consisting of four
specific siRNA sequences and non-targeting control ONTARGET plus smart pool (Dharmacon, ThermoScientific)
were used and cells were transfected at a concentration
of 50 nM. AR was downregulated by transfection of
30 nM with the following annealed constructs: sense
5’-GCACUGCUACUCUUCAGCAdTdT-3’
and
antisense 5’-UGCUGAAGAGUAGCAGUGCdTdT-3’,
