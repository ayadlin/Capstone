ABSTRACT
Recent studies have reported that hyper-methylation in the promoter region
of miRNAs could silence the expression of tumor suppressive miRNAs and might
play significant roles in the process of tumor development. However, the potential
mechanisms regarding how methylation of miRNA CpG Island could regulate cancer
cell chemo-resistance have not yet been studied. Using microarray and BSP (Bisulfate
Sequencing PCR) assays, we found that compared with the parent SGC7901/VCR cells,
expression of miR-129-5p was restored in SGC7901/VCR gastric cancer multi-drug
resistant cell line treated by de-methylation reagent (5-AZA-dC). Using gain or loss
of function assays, we found the over-expressed miR-129-5p reduced the chemoresistance of SGC7901/VCR and SGC7901/ADR cells, while down-regulation of miR129-5p had an opposite effect. Furthermore, three members of multi-drug resistance
(MDR) related ABC transporters (ABCB1, ABCC5 and ABCG1) were found to be direct
targets of miR-129-5p using bioinformatics analysis and report gene assays. The
present study indicated that hyper-methylation of miR-129-5p CpG island might play
important roles in the development of gastric cancer chemo-resistance by targeting
MDR related ABC transporters and might be used as a potential therapeutic target in
preventing the chemo-resistance of gastric cancer.

INTRODUCTION

Epigenetic regulation involving DNA methylation
is a heritable and enzyme-induced modification in human,
which modulate the expression of target mRNA without
direct changing of the DNA sequences. Epigenetic
modification of mRNA CpG islands has been widely
reported to down-regulate the target mRNA expression
in cancer-related malignant phenotypes [5, 6]. The hypermethylation of promoter CpG island affect not only tumor
suppressive mRNAs, but also tumor suppressive miRNAs.
The hyper-methylation in the CpG islands of miRNA
promoter can silence the expression of tumor-suppressive
miRNAs or drug sensitizing miRNAs, resulting in
oncogenic or chemo-resistant phenotypes in cancers.
Some tumor suppressive miRNAs such as miR-34a and
miR-375 have been reported to be silenced by the hypermethylation of their promoter regions and play important

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding
RNAs with approximately 19~24 nucleotides in length.
MicroRNAs can regulate expression of multiple targeted
genes by inducing translational silencing or causing
degradation of the targets through acting in association
with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) [1,
2]. It has been reported that miRNAs can regulate
many malignant phenotypes of cancer, such as cancer
cell proliferation, apoptosis, MDR, cell migration and
invasion [3, 4]. Understanding miRNA functions and the
potential malignant mechanisms requires elucidation of
the molecular pathways that are responsible for specific
biological phenomenon through the integration of the
modification and the associated targets of miRNAs.

roles in the related cancers [7, 8].
In the present study, we found that the promoter
region of miR-129-5p was hyper-methylated in gastric
cancer MDR cell lines. Furthermore, the function of miR129-5p methylation in cancer drug resistance and the
potential mechanisms were explored. Moreover, members
of the MDR associated ABC transporters were found to be
direct targets of miR-129-5p, indicating an important role
of the methylation of this miRNA in modulating MDR in
gastric cancer.

and result in the development of cancer diseases [9]. In
order to test the effects of hypo-methylation in gastric
cancer MDR cell lines, we treated the vincristine resistant
gastric cancer MDR cell line SGC7901/VCR with 2μM
de-methylation reagent 5-AZA-dC. The SGC7901/VCR
cell line was established using Vincristine with consistent
small doses’ treatment in our lab. During the induction, the
cross resistant of the cell line with other chemotherapeutic
drugs (5-FU and DDP) occur, which was called “multidrug resistance”. Using MTT, we found the IC50 values
to drugs 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), Vincristine (VCR) and
Cisplatin (DDP) were decreased after 5-AZA-dC treatment
(Figure 1A). ADR accumulation and retention assay
showed that the accumulation of 5-AZA-dC treated cells
was increased and the retention was decreased compared
with untreated cells (Figure 1B), indicating that the drug
resistant abilities of SGC7901/VCR cells were decreased
after 5-AZA-dC treatment.

we performed microarray analysis using 2μM 5-AZAdC treated MDR gastric cancer cells and the parent
SGC7901/VCR cell line was used as a negative control.
The decreased miRNAs in 5-AZA-dC treated SGC7901/
VCR cells were then calculated using ANOVO analysis.
6 miRNAs were found to be significantly down regulated
in 5-AZA-dC treated SGC7901/VCR cells compared
with SGC7901/VCR cell line. Among them, miR-1295p was chosen for further demonstration using BSP
analysis because it had a most significant difference from
the control cell line (1.63 fold increase in 5-AZA treated
SGC7901/VCR cells). (Figure 1 C).

The degree of miR-129-5p methylation was further
demonstrated using BSP analysis. As shown in Figure 2A,
the methylation degree of miR-129-5p CpG islands were
increased to 70~80% in the MDR cell lines SGC7901/
VCR and SGC7901/ADR compared with the parent
SGC7901 cell line which was only 61% methylated.
Real-time PCR showed that the expression of miR129-5p was significantly down regulated in SGC7901/

the methylation percent of MDR SGC7901/VCR and
SGC7901/ADR cells were gradually decreased in 2μM
and 4μM 5-AZA-dC treated groups compared with the
control group (Figure 2C); while the relative miR-1295p expression was gradually increased in 2μM and 4μM

increased the IC50 values of the chemotherapeutic drugs
(5-FU, VCR and DDP) compared with both negative

transfection and the parent MDR cells (Figure 3C and 3D).
To avoid the cell line-specific effect, we performed
chemo sensitivity assay again in another two gastric
cancer cell lines (MKN45 and MKN28) using transient
transfection of miR-129-5p.The transfection efficiency
of both pre-miR-129-5p and antagomirs in MKN45 and
MKN28 cells were validated using real-time PCR as
shown in supplementary figures 1A and 1C.Transient
transfection of pre-miR-129-5p in gastric cancer cell lines
also decreased the IC 50 values of the chemotherapeutic
drugs compared with the negative control groups; while
miR-129-5p antagomir had an opposite effect as indicated

in Supplementary Figures 1B and 1D.

displaying no effect on Luc-B1M, Luc-C5M and LucG1M expression (Figure 4B, 4C and 4D). In contrast,
miR-150 did not exhibit any effect on the expression of
Luc-B1, Luc-C5 or Luc-G1 (Figure 4B, 4C and 4D), in
accordance with the fact that the three 3’-UTR contains

assays using ABCB1, ABCC5 and ABCG1 antibodies.
As indicated in Figure 4E, the transient transfection of
SGC7901 cells with pre-miR-129-5p decreased ABCB1,
ABCC5 and ABCG1 protein levels, which suggests that
miR-129-5p miRNAs regulate ABCB1, ABCC5 and

level. The RNA levels of ABCB1, ABCC5 and ABCG1

antagomir alone had the ability to trigger tumor growth in
nude mice, it promoted growth and drug-resistance even
more under the treatment of anti-cancer drugs.The present
study also indicated that miR-129-5p is a candidate in the
future study for the therapeutics of gastric cancer drugresistance.

DISCUSSION
The CpG island methylation of tumor suppressive
miRNAs was widely discovered in various cancers all
over the world. The methylation modulated silencing
of miRNAs was found to play significant roles in the
malignant phenotypes of cancer development including
cell proliferation, migration and invasion, apoptosis, cell
cycle as well as MDR. For example, methylation of miR203 was found to be apparent in pre-cancerous lesions.
Ectopic expression of miR-203 was found to decrease
both the proliferation rate and anchorage independent
growth in cervical cancer cells [10]. Hyper-methylation
mediated the silencing of miR-124, which was a frequent
event in pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma. Functional
studies showed that miR-124 inhibited cell proliferation,
invasion and metastasis by targeting Rac1 [11]. MiR-34b
is silenced in human prostate cancer and the mechanism
is through CpG hyper-methylation. MiR-34b directly
targeted methyl-transferases and de-acetylases, resulting in
a positive feedback loop inducing partial de-methylation
and active chromatin modifications. Functionally, miR-34b
inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, migration/
invasion, and triggered G(0)/G(1) cell-cycle arrest and
apoptosis by directly targeting the Akt and its downstream
proliferative genes [12].
MiR-129 was firstly found to be down regulated
in undifferentiated gastric cancer tissues [13]. Later on,
miR-129 was found to exert growth inhibition and induce
cell death upon over-expression in bladder carcinoma,
hepatocellular carcinoma, esophageal carcinoma and
gastric cancer [14-17]. Methylation of miR-129-2 CpG
Island was frequently observed in various cancers such as
colorectal cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma,
hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric cancer [18-23]. In
endometrial cancer, reactivation of miR-129-2 in cancer
cells by pharmacologic induction of histone acetylation
and DNA de-methylation resulted in decreased SOX4
expression. In addition, restoration of miR-129-2 by cell
transfection also led to decreased SOX4 expression and
reduced proliferation of cancer cells [24]. In colorectal
cancer, ectopic expression of miR-129 promoted
apoptosis, inhibited cell proliferation and caused cell-cycle
arrest by suppressing a key anti-apoptotic protein, B-cell
lymphoma 2 (BCL2) [25].
In gastric cancer, the expression of miR-34b
and miR-129-3p was down regulated by DNA hypermethylation in primary gastric cancers, and the low
expression was associated with poor clinic-pathological

Anti-miR-129-5p modulated MDR in tumorbearing nude mice
To test the in vivo relationships between miR-129-5p
and MDR, we injected BALB/C nude mice subcutaneously
with gastric cancer cells. To facilitate the detection of
tumor size, a luciferase-labeled SGC7901-Luc cell line
established in our lab was used for injection.Six mice were
injected for each group. When the tumors reach around
5mm in size, the LNA (Lock Nucleic Acid) decorated
antagomir of miR-129-5p was injected into the tumors
6–8 sites of the tumors at the concentration of 110 μg/
kg/day. Three days later, the mice were intraperitoneally
injected using PBS with chemotherapeutic drugs 5-FU,
VCR and DDP two injections a week. The luciferase
signals of the tumors were tested every week under the
detection of IVIS 100 system. The luciferase signals of
tumors on the day 25, 32 and 39 were shown in Figure
5A and the analysis of signals were shown in Figure 5B.
Eight weeks after the first injection, the nude mice were
killed, and part of the tumors from the nude mice were
harvested, fixed and embedded in paraffin for further
staining. The formation of tumors was confirmed by H&E
staining (Figure 5C). Immunohistochemistry showed that
the expression of the ABC transporters ABCB1, ABCC5
and ABCG1 were increased in miR-129-5p antagomir
treated tumors compared with negative control (antiNC) treated tumors as indicated in Figure 5C. Real-time
PCR was further used to determine the expression of
miR-129-5p in the generated tumors. The results showed
that tumors with miR-129-5p antagomir treatment had a
decreased expression of miR-129-5p compared with NC
treated tumors as shown in Figure 5D.To test whether
treatment of antagomir alone would have an impact on
tumor growth in the absence of drug treatment, we tested
the effect of antagomir group compared with the NC group
with or without the treatment of the anti-cancer drug
5-FU. It is interesting that on the day 25 after injection,
the antagomir alone group grew still faster than the NC
group in both 5-FU treated or untreated mice, as shown in
Supplementary Figure 2. Both the antagomir alone group
and the NC group grew bigger in 5-FU untreated mice,
however, the NC group under PBS treatment grew even
bigger. These results suggested that although miR-129-5p

features [23]. The epigenetic repression of miR-129-2
leads to overexpression of SOX4 and the up-regulation
of SOX4 was inversely associated with the epigenetic
silencing of miR-129-2 in gastric cancer [24]. Although
previous studies found the promoter of miR-129-2 was
hyper-methylated in gastric cancer,in the present study,
we found the CpG Island of miR-129-5p was even more
hyper-methylated in gastric cancer multi-drug resistant cell
lines compared with the parent gastric cancer cell lines.
De-methylation treatment of SGC7901/VCR cells using
5-AZA-dC found an increased miR-129-5pexpression.
Furthermore, gain of function assays using pre-miRNAs
indicated that the over-expressed miR-129-5p repressed
MDR in both VCR and ADR resistant cell lines. Loss
of function assays using antagomirs, which mimics the
methylation modulated silence of miR-129-5p expression
promoted MDR in gastric cancer SGC7901 cell line. Our
findings indicate that the hyper-methylated miR-129-5p
plays a pro-drug-resistant function in gastric cancer multidrug resistant cells and that the hypo-methylation of miR129-5p might reverse MDR in gastric cancer cells.
Some studies have reported different results
regarding the expression of miR-129 in cancers. For
example, miR-129 was found to be highly expressed in
oral squamous cell carcinoma [26], esophageal cancer
[27], malignantly transformed human bronchial epithelial
cells [28], and retinoblastoma [29] compared with the
normal tissues. However, in these reports, the potential
functions or mechanisms of miR-129 in cancers were
not further explored or studied. This might be because
of the differential expression of the cancer genome
among various parts of the body.Our present study did
not focus on the comparison of miR-129-5p expression
in cancer with normal cells, but focused on the function
of hyper-methylated miR-129-5p in multi-drug resistant
cells compared with the parental cancer cells.The present
findings demonstrated that multi-drug resistant of cancer
cells could also be modulated by the hyper-methylation of
miRNA CpG island.
The ABC transporter family was known to have at
least 48 members identified in humans and 12 of them
were recognized to be putative drug transporters [30, 31].
If patients with tumors have a higher expression of various
ABC transporter pumps, they usually do not respond to
chemotherapy because the ABC transporters located
on the cytoplasm side of the resistant cell will efflux
chemotherapeutic drugs outside the tumor cells, leading
to chemo-resistance. In the present study, we found three
members of MDR related ABC transporters (ABCB1,
ABCC5 and ABCG1)were targeted by miR-129-5p, which
was a hyper-methylated miRNA in gastric cancer MDR
cell lines. Once the miR-129-5p were hyper-methylated
and silenced in gastric cancer cells, the expression of
MDR related ABC transporters (ABCB1, ABCC5 and
ABCG1) would increase and directly lead to a MDR
phenotype.

of the Experimental Animal center of the Fourth Military
Medical University. The approval ID for using the animals
was No.12566 from Experimental Animal Center of the
Fourth Military Medical University.

Cell culture and 5-Aza-dC treatment
The human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line
SGC7901 was obtained from the Academy of Military
Medical Science (Shanghai, China). Gastric cancer
vincristine resistant SGC7901/VCR cell line and
doxorubicin resistant cell line SGC7901/ADR were
constructed in our institute [32, 33]. All the cell lines
were preserved in our institute. SGC7901-Luc cells stably
expressing firefly luciferase were generated and preserved
in our lab. All of the cells were grown in RPMI1640
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37 °C with 5%
CO2 in a humidified incubator (Forma Scientific, Marietta,
OH, USA). For 5-Aza-dC treatment, cells were cultured
with 5-Aza-dC (2.5μM) for 48h, and then were harvested
for the analysis of microarray or for the detection of
miRNA expression.

Transient transfection
Transient transfection was performed with
siPORT™ NeoFX™ Transfection Agent (AM4511,
Applied Biosystems, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations. The precursors (premiRs) and antagomirs (anti-miRs) of the miR-129-5p were
obtained from Applied Biosystems (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA), supplied with negative control (NC) miRNAs
(pre-NC or anti-NC). Cells were harvested 48–72 h after
transient transfection.

Microarray
Microarray analysis was performed using a service
provider (Kangcheng Biology Corporation) in 2 to 5 µg
of total RNA from SGC7901/VCR cells and SGC7901/
VCR cells treated with 2μM 5-AZA-dC. Total RNA was
harvested using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and RNeasy mini
kit (QIAGEN) according to manufacturer’s instructions.

of the tumors (110 ug/kg/day). Three days later, the mice
were intraperitoneally injected with PBS containing VCR
(0.3mg/kg), 5-FU (5mg/kg) or DDP (2.5mg/kg) two
injections per week. The mice were injected with 100mg/
kg D-luciferin intraperitoneally five minutes before
imaging. Bioluminescent signals were detected on the 7th,
14th and 21th day after injection of the antagomir using
the IVIS 100 Imaging System (Xenogen, Hopkinton, MA).
Nude mice were killed 30 days after first injection. Their
subcutaneous tumors were harvested and fixed in 10%
formalin before paraffin embedding, then sectioned and
stained in H&E.

Intracellular ADR intensity analysis
The fluorescence intensity of intracellular ADR was
determined using flow cytometer analysis as described
before [34]. Specifically, log phase cells were plated in sixwell plates (1×106 cells/well) over night and were exposed
in ADR chemotherapeutic drugs to a final concentration of
1.3 g/ml. Cells were then cultured for 1 h and harvested
to test ADR accumulation or continuously cultured in
drug-free medium for another 2 hs, following by the
detection of ADR retention. Finally, cells were washed
twice with cold PBS and the mean fluorescence intensity
of intracellular ADR was detected using flow cytometer
analysis. The ADR-releasing index of cells was calculated
using the formula: releasing index = (accumulation value
- retention value)/ accumulation value.

Report gene assay
For reporter gene assay, cells were plated in 12-well
plates and were transfected with 2 µg of the target genes’
3’-UTR luciferase reporter plasmids (S) or the target
gene 3’-UTR mutant (M) and the empty pGL3-Control
vector (Promega Biotech Co., Ltd, Beijing, China) using
lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Cells were also co-transfected with the pre-miRNAs (150
nM, Applied Biosystems, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Assays were performed 24 h after transfection using the
Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega Biotech
Co., Ltd, Beijing, China). Firefly luciferase activities were
normalized to Renilla luciferase activities. A microRNA
precursor molecule control from Applied Biosystems
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used as one of the
negative miRNA controls and was referred to as pre-miRNC. All experiments were performed in triplicate.

In vitro drug sensitivity assay
A
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was performed to
evaluate cell growth ability as described previously [35].
5 × 103 cells transiently transfected with pre-miR-129-5p,
miR-129-5p antagomir or negative controls were collected
in 200 μl of complete medium, plated in 96-well plates
and incubated under normal conditions. Cultures were
assayed at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 days, and 490 nm absorbance
(A490) was read on a micro plate reader (168–1000 Model
680, Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA). The inhibition rates and
IC50 values were then calculated. Each experiment was
performed in triplicate and repeated for three times.

Bisulfite sequencing PCR
For bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP), Genomic
DNA was extracted from cells using TRIZOL (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA), and was then subjected to bisulfite
conversion using the EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit
(Zymo Research Corporation, Orange, CA) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. The bisulfite-converted
genomic DNA was used for the methylation analysis of
miR-129-5p with the predicted methylation primers, which
were designed according to the online primers program
“MethPrimer” (http://www.uro-gene.org/methprimer/).
The primers used for MSP are as follows: M-miR-129–F
5’ GTTGGGGAGATTTAGTTTGTT 3’ M-miR-129–R 5’
CCTACTCCAATTCCCCCTATAATAC 3’
The amplified fragments were cloned into the
pGEMT Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and five to
ten clones were randomly selected for bisulfite sequencing.

In vivo drug sensitivity assay
BALB/C nude mice at 4-6 weeks of age were
handled using best humane practices and cared for in
accordance with NIH Animal Care Institutional Guidelines
in the Experimental Animal Center of the Fourth Military
Medical University (Xi’an, Shaanxi Province, P. R.
China). 1 × 107 SGC7901-Luc cells in 0.2 ml cell culture
medium were injected subcutaneously into the left and
right upper back at a single site. Six mice were injected
for each group. When the mean tumor volume reached
100–200mm3, mice were randomized to start the injection
two consecutive days with 10 μl PBS containing miR129-5p antagomir or negative control RNAs at 6–8 sites

min, they were blocked in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 20
min and then in normal goat serum confining liquid for
40 min. After this, the sections were allowed to react over
night at 4°C with primary antibody for ABCB1, ABCC5
and ABCG1 (Santa Cruz). After rewarming for 40 min,
the slides were reacted with second antibodies (Zhongshan
Goldenbridge Biotechnology CO. LTD) for another
40 min at room temperature. Then the products were
developed with 3,3’-diaminobenzidine and counterstained
with haematoxylin.

Total RNA from cells or tumors from mice was
extracted using TRIZOL (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) with RNase-free DNase. Reverse transcription was
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(D350A, TaKaRa Biotechnology (DALIAN), Co., Ltd,
DaLian, Liaoning Province, China). qRT-PCR was
performed to determine the expression levels of each
miRNA using the exact sequences (U to T) of these
miRNAs as the forward primers and the unique q-PCR
primer from the cDNA Synthesis Kit as the reverse
primer. U6 was used as an internal control, and each
plate contained one cDNA sample for each primer as a
calibration sample. All experiments were performed in
triplicate.

Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were compared by Student’s t
test or an ANOVA test. If the test result of the homogeneity
of variances between the groups was significant, the
Mann-Whitney test was appropriately adopted.In samples
with small size (n<30) and with non-normal distribution
and/or elevated dispersion, we also used non-parametric
statistics. All statistical analyses were conducted using
SPSS software, version 14.0 (Chicago, Illinois, USA).

Western Blot
To determine the levels of protein expression, log
phase cells were harvested from 90 mm culture plates,
lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (150 mMNaCl, 50 mMTris–
HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1% SDS, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF,
1% NP40, 5 ug/ml aprotinin, and 1 ug/ml leupeptin) on
ice, and then centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 min. Total
proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Inc, Hercules, CA, USA) and blotted onto
nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences Corp.,
Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Membranes were blocked with
10% non-fat milk powder at room temperature for 2 h and
incubated overnight with primary antibodies: anti-ABCB1
(1:1000; Abcam plc. Cambridge, MA, USA), anti-ABCC5
(1:2000; Abcam plc. Cambridge, MA, USA), anti-ABCG1
(1:1500; Abcam plc. Cambridge, MA, USA), or anti-βactin antibody (1:2000; Sigma-Aldrich Co. Louis, MO,
USA). After three 5 min washes in TriethanolamineBuffered Saline Solution with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T),
membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase
(HRP) conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2000; Santa
cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Dallas, TX, USA) for 4 h at
room temperature and then washed again in TBS-T and
visualized with an enhanced chemi-luminescence kit
(ECL-kit, santa cruz biotechnology, inc.Dallas, TX, USA).
All experiments were performed in triplicate.

CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that
miR-129-5p plays an important role in antagonizing
MDR in gastric cancer cell lines by directly targeting and
inhibiting three MDR-related ABC transporters--ABCB1,
ABCC5 and ABCG1. The hyper-methylation of miR-1295p CpG island in gastric cancer MDR cells leads to an
increased expression of these ABC transporters, which
resulted in a direct drug resistance. Thus, our findings
demonstrated miR-129-5p is significant in modulating
MDR in gastric cancer and that targeting miR-129-5p
might be a potential therapeutic strategy in gastric cancer
gene therapies.
