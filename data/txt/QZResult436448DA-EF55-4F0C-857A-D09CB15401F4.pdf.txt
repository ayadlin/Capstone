ABSTRACT
In this study the detailed characteristic of the anti-cancer agent 3-bromopyruvate
(3-BP) activity in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae model is described, with
the emphasis on its influence on energetic metabolism of the cell. It shows that
3-BP toxicity in yeast is strain-dependent and influenced by the glucose-repression
system. Its toxic effect is mainly due to the rapid depletion of intracellular ATP.
Moreover, lack of the Whi2p phosphatase results in strongly increased sensitivity
of yeast cells to 3-BP, possibly due to the non-functional system of mitophagy of
damaged mitochondria through the Ras-cAMP-PKA pathway. Single deletions of genes
encoding glycolytic enzymes, the TCA cycle enzymes and mitochondrial carriers result
in multiple effects after 3-BP treatment. However, it can be concluded that activity
of the pentose phosphate pathway is necessary to prevent the toxicity of 3-BP,
probably due to the fact that large amounts of NADPH are produced by this pathway,
ensuring the reducing force needed for glutathione reduction, crucial to cope with the
oxidative stress. Moreover, single deletions of genes encoding the TCA cycle enzymes
and mitochondrial carriers generally cause sensitivity to 3-BP, while totally inactive
mitochondrial respiration in the rho0 mutant resulted in increased resistance to 3-BP.

microarrays [4]. Yeast model has proven its usefulness
as a first-line tool in discovery of mechanisms of basic
processes engaged in pathogenesis thanks to the conserved
protein interaction networks. The direct contribution
is the basic knowledge on the cell cycle regulation [5].
The discovery and analysis of apoptotic processes in
yeast allowed better understanding of the molecular
mechanisms underlying apoptosis-related diseases [6].
Heterologous expression of human proteins in yeast
cells allowed understanding of the functions of many
disease-related proteins leading to the identification of
the disease progression mechanisms. Research using
yeast has also provided relevant information regarding
molecular basis of cancer, resulting in the identification

INTRODUCTION
Research using yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has
provided much information concerning the mechanisms
of cellular metabolic processes, cell cycle regulation,
recombination, replication and repair of DNA as well as
the cell death mechanisms, protein folding and biogenesis
of organelles [1]. It is predicted that almost half of all
yeast genes (about 3000) have structural or functional
homologues in the human genome [2]. Further, yeast
genome was the first eukaryotic genome to be fully
sequenced [3], which accelerated the development of
new holistic research methods, such as usage of deletion
and overexpression libraries, two-hybrid analysis and

of new therapeutic targets. There are certain phenotypic
characteristics of yeast rendering them a perfect model
system to investigate human diseases, as many of the basic
cellular processes are well conserved [7]. New anticancer
drugs can be tested on yeast model using specific mutant
strains having some phenotype characteristics similar
to cancer cells (such as faulty cell cycle control). For
example, the molecular mechanisms of topoisomerase II
inhibitors, used as anticancer drugs, were identified using
70 yeast strains with defective checkpoint control and
faulty DNA repair [8]. Usage of proper mutants also allows
testing for sensitivity, resistance mechanisms to new drugs
as well as synergistic interactions with other drugs [9].
Like cancer cells, fermenting yeast exhibit
overexpression of glycolytic enzymes in response to
high glucose availability. Activity of the key enzymes
(i.e., hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate
kinase) is highly increased. When growing on glucose,
predominantly expressed isoform of hexokinase is HK
II which is insensitive to inhibition by its product [10].
Furthermore, the first isoform of pyruvate kinase (Pyk1p),
which is more susceptible to allosteric activation by
fructose 1,6-bisohosphate, is strongly expressed. Because
of high cytoplasmic metabolism of pyruvate only a small
amount is oxidized and utilized in the Krebs cycle [11].
Together with decreased rate of TCA, the enzymatic
activities of aconitase, isocitrate dehydrogenase and
malate dehydrogenase are diminished [12]. Homologues
of mammalian PDK (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase)
enzymes (Pdhk) and corresponding phosphatases (Pdp)
are present in yeast [13]. The activity of yeast pyruvate
dehydrogenase is regulated by its phosphorylation. The
inactive dephosphorylated form is present mainly in
cells growing on nonfermentable carbon sources, thus
generating ATP through oxidative phosphorylation [14].
The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is also regulated
through its E3 subunit (lipoamide dehydrogenase), which
expression is decreased during fermentative metabolism
[15]. Lactate dehydrogenase occurs in yeast as two
isoforms localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane.
These enzymes irreversibly convert lactate into pyruvate
and take part in the respiratory chain. The cytosolic form
of lactate dehydrogenase is still unknown in yeast [16]. In
yeast the direction of pyruvate metabolism in cytosol is
mainly dependent on pyruvate decarboxylase (Pdc) activity
[17]. Pdc converts pyruvate into acetaldehyde which is
then oxidized in mitochondria [18] or reduced to ethanol
by alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh). Although the metabolism
of pyruvate in yeast and mammalian cells is not identical,
still the general mechanism is the same – increased flux
of this pathway diminishes the availability of substrates
for aerobic metabolism, as it is in the case of hyperactive
LDH in cancer cells. All these suggest that during intense
fermentation, Pdc activation is strictly connected to the
repression of mitochondrial respiration [19].

Metabolic similarities between fermenting yeast
cells and tumor cells allow the research concerning
metabolism-targeting
anti-cancer
drugs,
e.g.,
3-bromopyruvate. 3-BP is a structural analog of pyruvic
acid and is highly reactive - it shows strong alkylating
properties toward proteins. The pyruvic chain covalently
binds to the cysteine and histidine residues changing the
protein conformation and activity. 3-BP is also a putative
inhibitor of all reactions involving pyruvate. Additionally,
it was shown to inhibit hexokinase II [20]. During the tests
on rats, mice and rabbits 3-BP exhibited high anticancer
activity [21, 22]. All of the rats carrying a hepatoma
which were treated with 3-BP, were fully cured with no
recurrence. About 70% of cancer cells were killed after
one administration and after 4 weeks of treatment the rats
fully recovered [22].
The mechanism of selective anticancer effect of
3-BP is still not fully clarified. 3-BP probably inhibits
glycolysis by acting on enzymes catalyzing reactions
involving pyruvate (i.e., LDH, PC and PDH) leading to
ATP depletion. 3-BP is also thought to cause inhibition
of hexokinase II, which may lead to apoptosis of the
cell [20, 22, 23]. Moreover, it was shown in vitro that
3-BP is able to alkylate glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) leading to its inhibition [24]. It
is also assumed that 3-BP causes generation of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) which are highly toxic for the
cell [25]. It was shown that depletion of the intracellular
glutathione strongly increased sensitivity of yeast cells to
3-BP, which suggests that 3-BP causes oxidative stress and
may deplete the pool of reduced glutathione itself [26],
which has also been shown in human erythrocytes [27].
The specific activity of 3-BP toward cancer cells may be
also due to the selective uptake into the cells. 3-BP was
shown to enter the cells through the Monocarboxylate
Transporters (MCT), transporters of lactate and pyruvate.
Research in breast cancer cells shown that butyrate, which
induces the expression of monocarboxylate transporter
MCT4, causes increased sensitivity to 3-BP [28]. It was
also shown using the KBM7 human myeloid leukemia
cell line, that MCT1 mediates the uptake of 3-BP and
that deletion of the MCT1 results in resistance to 3-BP
[29]. Moreover, it was recently presented that higher
expression of MCT1 in multiple myeloma cells correlated
with increased uptake of 3-BP, when compared to the
control cells [30]. The characteristics of transport of 3-BP
into human erythrocytes was described very recently [31].
Our recent research on 3-BP using the yeast model showed
that it enters the yeast cell mainly through the lactate/
pyruvate-H+ permease Jen1p and that it is not a substrate
for the multidrug resistance PDR efflux pumps [26].
We also showed that 3-BP is a potent antifungal agent
with very selective toxicity toward the human pathogen
Cryptococcus neoformans [32].
This is the first report showing multidirectional
influence of 3-BP on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae,

glucose-repressible. Henceforth, most of the experiments
were performed using sucrose as a sole carbon source in
culture media, unless it is stated differently.
Direct impact on cellular ATP levels and cell
viability in liquid culture of yeast during the first 5 hours
of exposition was determined. 3-BP concentrations of 1.8
mM (a sub-MIC value) and 3 mM (1.5-fold MIC) were
chosen for the experiment. ATP level values shown are
recalculated per living cell, to show the change in ATP
level in living cells, neglecting the ATP fall caused by
decreasing amount of cells being alive. The wild-type
W303-1A (Figure 1A) and a respiratory deficient mutant
(containing no mitochondrial DNA) W303-1A rho0
(Figure 1B) were chosen for the test.
In the wild-type W303-1A in the first hour of the
experiment, concentration of 1.8 mM of 3-BP did not
cause any effect on the intracellular ATP levels, however it
decreased the strain viability to about 70%. 3 mM caused
similar viability decrease, however simultaneous fall to
under 60% in the level of ATP occurred. In the W303-1A
rho0 respiratory mutant the effect on the ATP levels was
significantly stronger (about 60% and 35% of the control,

RESULTS
General toxicity of 3-BP in the yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its influence on the
intracellular ATP levels
It was crucial to determine general toxicity of 3-BP
in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains and its influence
on the intracellular ATP levels. The minimal synthetic
medium (SD) was chosen for all of the experiments
and different carbon sources were tested using the spottest method in the wild-type W303-1A strain. These
preliminary tests showed that glucose and other repressing
sugars cause relative insensitivity to 3-BP (no visible
effect at concentrations up to 3 mM in the wild-type),
whereas nonfermentable and non-repressing carbon
sources render wild-type yeast sensitive to 3-BP in the
range of 1.5-2.5 mM, depending on a strain. These results
suggested that the uptake mechanism of 3-BP could be

for 1.8 mM and 3 mM 3-BP, respectively), however
showing weaker influence on viability. In the second and
third hour of incubation further decrease in ATP levels
was shown for both strains, however viability was more
affected in the wild-type W303-1A. In the fifth hour of
the experiment both concentrations of 3-BP dropped the
ATP levels to about 20% of control in the wild-type strain.
Also in the respiratory deficient mutant 3 mM of 3-BP
caused decrease of ATP to about 20%, however 1.8 mM
3-BP only to about 35%. The viability of both strains when
treated with 1.8 mM was about 80%. When 3 mM 3-BP
was used the wild-type viability decreased to under 40%,
whereas the rho0 maintained viability of 60%.
It can be concluded that the decrease of ATP levels
is more rapid in the rho0 respiratory-deficient mutant,
however, it is not as strong as in the wild-type in the
long-term perspective. Generally, the rho0 remained
more viable during the experiment, regardless of the
3-BP concentration used, showing that the presence
of functional mitochondria causes increased overall
sensitivity to 3-BP.
The differences in susceptibility of the wild-type
W303-1A and the mitochondrial respiratory mutant W3031A rho0 to 3-BP were also tested using the spot-test method
(Figure 1C). The respiratory mutant exhibited increased
resistance to 3-BP comparing to wild-type W303-1A,
confirming the results of experiment determining the ATP
levels and viability after 3-BP treatment.

ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGD1) and sensitive
phenotype in the case of isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDH1)
and (IDH2), lipoamide dehydrogenase (LPD1), aconitate
hydratase (ACO2), mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase
(MDH1) and succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein subunit
(SDH1) mutants. Resistant phenotype was observed in the
case of citrate synthase (CIT3).
As the metabolism and flux of pyruvate may be
crucial to identify the mechanism of action of 3-BP, the
influence of functionality of the Mitochondrial Pyruvate
Carrier (Mpc) on susceptibility to 3-BP was checked.
There are three genes in yeast taking part in encoding the
mitochondrial pyruvate carrier, i.e., MPC1, MPC2 and
MPC3, with the first one being crucial for its function.
The results of the performed spot-test are presented in
Figure 2A. Comparing to the wild-type, the Δmpc1 mutant
clearly showed increased sensitivity to 3-BP with just a
minimal effect in the Δmpc2 strain and no visible effect in
the Δmpc3 strain.
Three other mitochondrial membrane proteins, i.e.,
the mitochondrial porin Por1p (VDAC), mitochondrial
phosphate carrier (Mir1p) and mitochondrial oxaloacetate
carrier (Oac1p) were also tested (Figure 2A). Deletion
of each of the POR1, MIR1 and OAC1 genes resulted in
increased sensitivity to 3-BP.
The influence of deletion of genes encoding factors
involved in the regulation of the glucose-repression system
on 3-BP sensitivity was also tested. Δtpk1 strain, having
inactive PKA (cAMP-dependent protein kinase) and both,
Δmig1 and Δyck1 strain have defective glucose repression
[33, 34]. Δcat8 cells cannot activate the gluconeogenic
pathway and are unable to grow on unfermentable carbon
sources, having faulty glucose derepression. Δtpk1, Δmig1
and Δyck1 strains exhibited sensitivity to 3-BP, whereas
Δcat8 showed resistance comparing to the wild type
(Figure 2B).

Toxicity of 3-BP in yeast mutants with disrupted
glycolytic and TCA enzymes
Taking into account that 3-BP acts on the energetic
metabolism of the cell, an experiment was carried out in
order to check whether absence of specific glycolytic and
respiratory enzymes may have influence on susceptibility
to 3-BP. A set of 40 yeast strains from the EUROSCARF
collection having deleted single genes encoding proteins
engaged in glycolysis and TCA cycle were tested.
The summary of spot-tests showing the effect of
a specific mutation on 3-BP susceptibility is shown in
Table 1.
Deletion of genes encoding cytosolic enzymes
caused highly resistant phenotype in the case of
phosphofructokinase alpha (PFK1) and moderate
resistance in the case of glucokinase (GLK1),
phosphofructokinase beta (PFK2), pyruvate kinase
(PYK2), pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC1), alcohol
dehydrogenase (ADH1), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase
(FBP1), enolase-1 (ENO1) and isocitrate lyase (ICL1).
Hypersensitivity to 3-BP was observed in glucose6-phosphate dehydrogenase (ZWF1) and pyruvate
carboxylase (PYC1) mutants and moderate sensitivity in
transketolase (TKL1) and transaldolase (TAL1).
Deletion of genes encoding mitochondrial enzymes
and subunits caused high sensitivity in the case of alphawww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Overexpression of the Whi2p causes resistance to
3-BP in yeast cells
Using yeast multicopy genomic cDNA library
(Lacroute) for FY1679-28C strain transformation, nine
transformants hyper-resistant to 3-BP were isolated. The
resistant phenotype of the selected transformants was
confirmed using the spot-test method. Plasmid DNA from
resistant transformants was isolated and sequenced. All of
the isolated plasmids contained similar parts (lengths of
4 – 7 kb) of XV chromosome. The common part of these
sequences was the WHI2 gene.
It was shown that overexpression of Whi2p renders
the cells elongated and 3-fold larger than the wild-type.
Moreover, the cells are unable to complete cytokinesis
and the budding pattern becomes polar instead of
axial, resulting in filamentous growth [35]. It has been
suggested that Whi2p connects Ras2p to the Ras-protein
kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway, by influencing Ras2p

The 3-BP sensitive/resistant phenotype of each strain is specified, comparing to the wild-type BY4741. Comparison of 3-BP

localization. It was reported that lack of functional
Whi2p results in actin aggregation, which may trigger
apoptosis on the Ras-PKA pathway. It may also result in
mitochondrial damage during the diauxic shift [36].
One of the pathways of the general stress response
in yeast is through Msn2p and Msn4p transcription factors.
They lead to the expression of many stress responsive
genes through binding to the STRE (stress response
elements). It was shown that STRE-mediated gene
expression under stress conditions is strongly reduced in
cells with deletion of the WHI2 gene, comparing to the
wild-type. Moreover Δwhi2 cells reach the stationary
phase several hours later than the wild-type. Furthermore,
Δwhi2 mutant is unable to accumulate storage glycogen
[37]. Normally, when yeast cells are starved, they arrest
in G1 phase of the cell cycle and change their metabolism
to be able to survive the unfavorable conditions. Δwhi2
mutant cells do not exhibit this response to starvation, they
carry on dividing and the mutant cells in stationary phase
become much smaller than in WT. They also often arrest
randomly in the cell cycle [38].
It was also shown that Whi2p is required for
the TOR-controlled induction of mitophagy of the
dysfunctional mitochondria [39]. However, solely
fragmentation of mitochondria is not enough to trigger its
degradation. The pathway of mitophagy is independent of
the mechanism of mitochondrial fission and it is suggested
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that Whi2p links the mitophagy machinery to the RasPKA signaling pathway [45].
To confirm that Whi2p is engaged in resistance to
3-BP, a mutant strain with WHI2 gene deleted was tested.
The Δwhi2 strain in comparison to the wildtype shows strongly increased susceptibility to 3-BP
(Figure 3A). However, growth of the Δpsr1 mutant (which
has deletion of the PSR1 gene, encoding a binding partner
of Whi2p) was only slightly weaker than of the wild-type.
To check whether expression of the WHI2 gene from
plasmid restores the resistance to 3-BP in the Δwhi2 mutant,
a spot-test using the Δwhi2 and the wild-type strain with
multicopy plasmid containing the WHI2 gene and an empty
pFL44L plasmid as a control was carried out. The presence
of a multicopy plasmid with the WHI2 gene increased
resistance to 3-BP almost equally, both in the wild type
BY4741 and the Δwhi2 strain (Figure 3B).
It can be concluded that presence of Whi2p
phosphatase is essential for resistance to 3-BP in yeast,
as its overexpression increases resistance to whereas its
deletion results in greater susceptibility to 3-BP.

and Psr2p, causes increased sensitivity to 3-BP

with Whi2p [40]. The double Δpsr1Δpsr2 mutant exhibits
similar phenotype properties to the Δwhi2 strain, i.e., reduced
STRE-mediated gene expression, hyperphosphorylation of
the Msn2p/Msn4p factors, higher sensitivity to stress (such
as heat shock or sodium stress). Interaction of Psr1p, Msn2p
and Whi2p was shown by immunoprecipitation experiments
[43]. It is possible that Whi2p is a necessary adaptor between
Msn2p and Psr1p which allows direct dephosphorylation of
Msn2p by Psr1p phosphatase. These data suggest that Whi2p
together with Psr1p/Psr2p are needed for activation of the
general stress response by interacting with Msn2p [43].
However, Whi2p and Psr1p/Psr2p are just three of many
other activators of Msn2p/Msn4p pathway (e.g., Mck1p,
Snf1p, Hog1p kinases) [41].
To check whether Whi2p-mediated resistance occurs
on the known pathway due to its binding with Psr1p/
Psr2p phosphatases, single Δpsr1 and Δpsr2 mutants and
a double mutant Δpsr1Δpsr2 in the W303-1A background
were constructed and tested (Figure 4). None of the single
Δpsr1 and Δpsr2 mutants showed different sensitivity
to 3-BP than the wild-type. This is different than in the
BY4741 background, where the single Δpsr1 showed
slightly increased sensitivity. However, in the W303-1A
background, double Δpsr1Δpsr2 mutant showed increased
susceptibility to 3-BP comparing to wild-type and the

Msn4p and Hog1p are essential for the initiation of
general stress response pathway in yeast [42]. Under stress
condition Whi2p/Psr1p phosphatase complex probably
activates Msn2p and Msn4p, which may activate the
Hog1p kinase.
Results in Figure 5A show that Whi2p-mediated
resistance phenotype in yeast is probably independent
of general stress response pathway. Deletions of genes
encoding Msn2p and Msn4p do not seem to have any
negative effects on yeast grown on 3-BP. Transformation
with multicopy plasmid containing the WHI2 gene
improves resistance to similar levels in every strain
tested (Δwhi2, Δmsn2, Δmsn4, WT) which also suggests
that resistance to 3-BP conferred by Whi2p is not due
to upregulation of the HOG pathway (Figure 6). What
is more, strain with deleted HOG1 gene (in BY4741
background) shows slightly increased resistance to 3-BP.

As the HOG pathway is responsible for resistance to
osmotic stress, growth characteristics were compared
to growth on medium with sodium chloride as a control
(Figure 5B). These results show that Whi2p-mediated
resistance to 3-BP probably does not occur via the HOG
stress response pathway. Increased resistance may occur
either because of direct Whi2p phosphatase activity or
due to existence of other unidentified signaling pathway
leading to other effectors than Hog1p.

single Δwhi2 mutant and a double mutant Δjen1Δwhi2
were constructed in the W303-1A background (Figure 7).
Both, Δwhi2 and double Δjen1Δwhi2 strains
exhibited increased sensitivity to 3-BP comparing to
the wild-type and a single Δjen1 mutant. However the
Δjen1Δwhi2 strain was proportionally more resistant to
3-BP comparing to the Δwhi2 strain, thus suggesting that
the effect of Whi2p is probably independent of the effect
of Jen1p.

Whi2 and Jen1 influences on sensitivity to 3-BP
seem to be independent

DISCUSSION
3-BP, a small-molecule alkylating agent has
been shown to be a potent and specific anticancer drug.
3-BP differs in the mode of action from the currently
available chemotherapeutics, as it directly targets the
energy metabolism of a cancer cell. Inhibition of both
glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
leads to rapid ATP depletion and apoptotic or necrotic
cell death. Moreover 3-BP exhibits little or no effect on

As the Whi2p has a pleiotropic activity, it was
checked if its influence on 3-BP sensitivity is connected
with its possible regulatory effect on expression and/
or activity of the Jen1p permease, which was shown to
transport 3-BP in yeast [26, 43]. To check whether the
resistance caused by deletion of JEN1 is connected with
the resistance caused by the overexpression of WHI2, a

normal healthy cells. In this study the characteristics of
3-BP toxicity in the yeast model are described, with the
emphasis on its influence on energetic metabolism of the
cell and chosen regulatory pathways.
The results of the experiment showing direct
influence of 3-BP on intracellular ATP levels in yeast,
suggest that the mitochondrial respiration enzymatic

machinery may be more sensitive to 3-BP than glycolysis,
still of course both pathways being inhibited, as it was
shown to happen in human cancer cells [44, 30]. Despite
the fact that in the first hour of incubation ATP decrease
is stronger in rho0 respiratory deficient mutant, it retains
higher ATP levels at the end of the incubation and shows
higher viability than the wild-type strain. The ATP

depletion in the first hour is probably stronger in rho0
cells because glycolysis is its main source of energy and
in the wild-type it takes time to affect the mitochondria
and deplete the respiratory substrates and the TCA
intermediates. This can be also due to the fact that loss of
the mitochondrial genome in rho0 mutant triggers global
reprogramming of gene expression called the retrograde
response, which is a set of signaling pathways leading from
the mitochondria to the nucleus [45]. It triggers expression
of the nuclear CIT2 gene, encoding citrate synthase-2,
to ensure proper levels of α-ketoglutarate, which is a
crucial precursor for the amino acids biosynthesis [46].
It was also shown that rho0 cells dramatically induce
expression of ABC transporter-encoding genes like
PDR5, as well as exhibit elevated transcription of loci
encoding enzymes involved in sphingolipid biosynthesis
[47]. This is however not in this case, as it was shown
that 3-BP is not a substrate for the yeast PDR system [26].
The retrograde regulation, which has been shown to be
controlled by the Rtg1p, Rtg2p and Rtg3p factors, results
in increased expression of genes involved in anaplerotic
pathways, transport of small molecules, as well as
upregulated peroxisomal activities and stress responses. It
increases over 10-fold expression of CIT2 gene (encoding
a glyoxylate cycle citrate synthase), DLD3 (encoding a
cytosolic D-lactate dehydrogenase) and PDH1 (encoding
protein involved in propionate metabolism) [48]. In cells
with dysfunctional mitochondria expression of genes
encoding enzymes of the TCA cycle that lead to the
production of α-ketoglutarate (i.e., CIT1, ACO1, IDH1 and
IDH2) is dependent on the RTG genes, unlike cells with
normal mitochondrial function, where they are regulated
by HAP2,3,4,5 transcription complex [49]. Independent
regulation of these genes, as well as upregulation of the
anaplerotic pathways may be responsible for increased
resistance to 3-BP of the rho0 cells. The 3-BP-resistant
phenotype of rho0 mutants was also shown in Candida
glabrata (unpublished data). The expression of pyruvate
carboxylase (PYC1) and acetyl-CoA synthase (ACS1)
is also upregulated in rho0 cells. Moreover, flux of
metabolites from β-oxidation of fatty acids and glyoxylate
cycle are upregulated [54]. Pyc1p supplies oxaloacetate
for gluconeogenesis and to replenish tricarboxylic acid
cycle intermediates [50]. Overexpression of PYC1 could

be a probable determinant of 3-BP-resistance in the rho0
cells, as its deletion causes sensitivity to 3-BP.
Concerning the first step of glycolysis in yeast,
hexokinase-2 (Hxk2p) is the predominant isoform when
glucose is abundant, however upon glucose depletion its
expression is repressed and hexokinase-1 (Hxk1p) and
glucokinase (Glk1p) become active. Hxk1p and Glk1p
function redundantly, their expression is upregulated in
the absence of the other one [51]. Though not strong,
resistance of Δglk1 strain to 3-BP may suggest that Glk1p
could be more susceptible to inhibition by 3-BP than
Hxk1p. In human cells it is proposed that hexokinase-2 is
the isoform sensitive to 3-BP [20].
Glucose-6-phosphate is a substrate for further
glycolytic processing, however, it may be entering the
pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) instead. Deletion of the
ZWF1 gene encoding 6-phosphoglucose dehydrogenase,
the enzyme catalyzing the first and rate-limiting step of
the pentose phosphate pathway, resulted in increased
sensitivity to 3-BP. Similar effect was visible in the Δtal1
mutant, lacking the enzyme transaldolase, which creates a
reversible link between two the PPP and glycolysis [52].
The 3-BP-sensitive phenotype which is observed when the
pentose phosphate pathway is disrupted may be explained
by the fact, that PPP is a crucial source of NADPH, which
acts as a cellular reducing power. NADPH provides the
reducing potential for most of the antioxidant enzymes,
such as glutathione and thioredoxin systems. As pentose
phosphate pathway is directly connected to the glycolytic
pathway, any change in activity of glycolytic enzymes
may influence the flux of PPP, resulting in change of the
amounts of NADPH produced [53]. It was previously
shown that disruption of the ZWF1 gene resulted in
decreased resistance to oxidants, confirming the role of
PPP in the oxidant tolerance mechanism [54]. Gorsich et
al. showed that PPP mutants were inefficient at reducing
furfural resulting in higher sensitivity to this inhibitor,
as well as to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural [55]. Moreover,
previous studies showed correlation between resistance to
sorbic acid and activity of several PPP enzymes [56].
The lack of a phosphofructokinase (PFK) probably
forces the upregulation of the PPP, resulting in higher levels
of NADH, which leads to enhanced glutathione reduction
and increased 3-BP resistance. It is also known that strain

with deleted PFK1 gene, encoding the catalytic subunit of
phosphofructokinase-1 show no Pasteur effect [57].
Moreover, induction of gluconeogenesis leads to
a higher production of glucose-6-phosphate, the key
substrate for the pentose phosphate pathway [58]. This
would be confirmed by the 3-BP-sensitive phenotype
of the Δpyc1 (pyruvate carboxylase-1), as this mutation
blocks formation of oxaloacetate from pyruvate, which is
a crucial step of gluconeogenesis. In the case of Δpyc1
the effect may be also due to the decreased anaplerosis
of the TCA cycle, caused by low levels of oxaloactetate,
which hypothesis is supported by 3-BP-sensitivity of the
Δoac1 mutant lacking the mitochondrial oxaloacetate
carrier [59].
On the other hand, lack of other gluconeogenic
enzyme, namely fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (Fbp1p),
resulted in resistance to 3-bromopyruavte. Expression
profiles showed that genes induced by the diauxic shift
are induced by oxidative stress, DNA damage and other
stress conditions [63]. It was shown that fructose-1,6bisphosphatase is also involved in ROS production in
chronologically aged cells and after MMS treatment.
Absence of FBP1 resulted in better survival of cells
treated with MMS, improved surviving of aged cells and
delayed the induction of ROS production [63], which is
consistent with the 3-BP-resistant phenotype.
Disruption of pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) and
aldehyde dehydrogenease (ADH) causes the pyruvate to
enter the TCA cycle or gluconeogenesis rather than the
pathway of ethanol production, which agrees with the
fact that active glucoeneogenesis seems to diminish the
toxicity of 3-BP. Deletion of gene enoding pyruvate kinase
(PYK2) results in increased resistance to 3-BP, possibly
also beacuse phospho-enolpyruvate is forced into the
gluconeogenic pathway.
Deletion of genes encoding TCA enzymes, i.e.,
ACO2, IDH1, IDH2, KGD1, LPD1, SDH1 and MDH1
generally resulted in increased sensitivity to 3-BP also
suggesting that preservation of the functional TCA cycle
flux is important for preventing the 3-BP-induced toxicity.
The Δkgd1 strain lacking the activity of mitochondrial
alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase is a respiratory
deficient mutant and it does not utilize glycerol, however
it has a functional respiratory chain and synthesis of other
mitochondrial enzymes is not affected. In this mutant
expression levels of aconitase, isocitrate dehydrogenase,
succinate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase as well
as dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase were not different from the
wild-type [60]. It is possible that deletion of KGD1 as well
as other genes encoding enzymes of the TCA cycle forward
of the isocitrate dehydrogenase resulted in sensitivity
to 3-BP due to activation of the glyoxylate cycle. This
would be supported by the fact that deletion of the ICL1
gene, encoding isocitrate lyase (the crucial enzyme in the
glyoxylate cycle), resulted in resistance to 3-BP.
Deletion of CIT3 gene, encoding a mitochondrial
citrate synthase, has no effect on the citrate/methylcitrate
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

synthase activity, as the other isoforms are active.
However, Cit3p is essential for growth on propionate as a
carbon and energy source. It was shown that Δcit3 exhibits
unusual pyruvate metabolism with dramatic accumulation
of acetate and isobutanol, which is probably caused by
excessive mitochondrial propionyl-CoA, resulting in
inhibition of the PDH E2 subunit [61]. The Δcit3 strain
exhibited resistance to 3-BP which may be explained
by the fact, that accumulation of acetate occurring in
this strain may lead to the downregulation of pyruvate
decarboxylation and increased which directs pyruvate
rather to mitochondria or to the gluconeogenic pathway.
It was shown that deletion of MPC genes, encoding
mitochondrial pyruvate carrier, results in impaired pyruvate
metabolism, accumulation of upstream metabolites and
depletion of TCA cycle intermediates. Δmpc mutants
exhibited increased cytoplasmic pyruvate concentrations,
depleted malate and acetyl-CoA, suggesting that they
are unable to properly convert pyruvate to mitochondrial
acetyl-CoA, which results in nonfunctional TCA cycle
and impaired ATP production. Uptake assay on isolated
mitochondria showed almost no uptake of 14C-pyruvate in
the Δmpc1 strain [62]. The sensitivity to 3-BP of the Δmpc1
and Δlpd1, together with resistance of the Δpdc1, may
suggest that increased activity of the PDH-bypass pathway
possibly increases 3-BP toxicity.
Δpor1 and Δmir1 mutants, lacking mitochondrial
porin and phosphate carrier (being the parts of the ATPsynthasome), show sensitivity to 3-BP, possibly due to
partially disrupted respiration, as well as an imbalance of
NAD/NADH, resulting in insufficient reducing buffer.
It can be concluded that when grown on medium
with 3-BP, single mutants concerning the TCA cycle
enzymes exhibit different phenotypes than rho0 strains,
possibly due to the retrograde response activated in the
latter. Generally, single deletions of genes encoding the
TCA cycle enzymes and mitochondrial carriers resulted
in increased sensitivity to 3-BP, whereas mutations in
the glycolytic pathway resulted in increased resistance
(Figures 8 and 9). On the other hand disruption of
the pentose phosphate pathway resulted in increased
sensitivity. It is probable that most of the effects of
these mutations come down to the upregulation of
gluconeogenesis and pentose phosphate pathway which
is the main source of NADPH which provides the
reducing potential for most of the antioxidant agents,
such as glutathione, which has great influence on 3-BP
susceptibility [26]. Moreover, also the TCA cycle
replenishes the pool of NADPH through mitochondrial
transhydrogenase, thus having an impact on cellular
glutathione levels [63].
It cannot be also excluded that 3-bomopyruvate
could be recognized as a mimicking substrate for one or
more enzymes engaged in metabolism of pyruvate. It has
been shown in vitro that lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
may use 3-BP as a substrate, however with over 100-fold
lower affinity than pyruvate (unpublished data).

Yeast cells grown on medium with high
concentration of glucose during the logarithmic phase
produce energy mainly by fermentation of glucose,
whereas respiration and stress response mechanisms
are repressed (the Crabtree effect). When glucose
is exhausted the diauxic shift occurs, resulting in
changes in expression levels of many proteins as well
as the upregulation of stress response pathways [42].
Cells switch to metabolism of unfermentable carbon
sources, gluconeogenic, TCA cycle, and glyoxylate
shunt genes are induced [64]. The expression of PCK1
(phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase), FBP1 (fructose1,6-bisphosphatase), MDH2 (malate dehydrogenase), as
well as ICL1 (isocitrate lyase) and MLS1 (malate synthase)
are upregulated during glucose depletion [65]. In yeast
the Ras-cAMP-PKA signaling pathway is essential for
the diauxic shift, it also regulates mitochondrial function
and ROS production. PKA (cAMP-dependent protein
kinase) is inactive during unfermenting growth and is
activated when glucose becomes abundant and lack of
PKA results in defective glucose repression [66]. The
Δtpk1 strain, lacking the subunit of PKA, shows increased
sensitivity to 3-BP, which may be due to the defect in
glucose repression mechanism. In yeast cells grown in
the absence of glucose, on media with alternative sugars,
such as sucrose, galactose, and maltose, Mig1p repressor

activity is inhibited. In the presence of glucose Mig1p
factor localizes to the nucleus repressing expression
of target genes such as SUC2 encoding invertase [42].
Cat8p is one of the factors required for activation of
gluconeogenesis during growth on unfermetable carbon
sources, therefore Δcat8 cells are unable to grow on
unfermentable carbon sources [69]. CAT8 transcription
is inhibited by Mig1p and activated by the Hap2/3/4/5p
complex. Δcat8 mutant, exhibited increased resistance
to 3-BP, whereas Δmig1 strain, having defective glucose
repression, showed increased sensitivity to 3-BP when
grown on sucrose. Similarly, the Δyck1 strain, exhibiting
faulty respiration repression by glucose [39, 40], showed
increased sensitivity to 3-BP. These results confirm that
glucose repression reduces sensitivity to 3-BP, which
effect is clearly visible in wild-type strains grown on
glucose.
PKA is also engaged in activation of metabolic flux
through glycolysis. PKA activates phosphofructokinase-2
(PFK2) [67], and indirectly also pyruvate kinase (PYK2)
through increased production of fructose-2,6 bisphosphate
which is an allosteric activator of pyruvate kinase [68].
PKA also phosphorylates the key gluconeogenic enzyme
fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1) leading to its
degradation [42]. Sensitivity of Δtpk1 cells to 3-BP may
be connected to its interaction with phosphofructokinase-2

[43]. It can, however, be excluded that WHI2-related
sensitivity to 3-BP is a consequence of disrupted general
stress response pathway, as the Δmsn2/Δmsn4 and Δhog1
strains do not exhibit sensitivity to 3-BP. Deletion of PSR1
and PSR2 genes encoding Whi2p binding partners resulted
in increased sensitivity suggesting, that Psr1p/Psr2p are
required for the Wh2p-mediated response to 3-BP.
Moreover, it was shown that lack of Whi2p leads to
actin aggregation, which is thought to induce apoptosis,
probably occurring on the Ras-cAMP-PKA pathway [42].
Δwhi2 cells exhibit nuclear fragmentation and loss of
mitochondrial DNA during diauxic shift. The Δwhi2 strain
was shown to be sensitive to 2 mM H2O2, unlike the wildtype. Mitochondria in Δwhi2 cells were reported to have
reduced membrane potential, exhibit fragmentation and
production of high levels of ROS during the diauxic shift
[42]. It has been recently explained to be a consequence of
defective mitophagy on the Ras-cAMP-PKA pathway in

and pyruvate kinase. Lack of PKA activity causes
decreased activity if these enzymes giving phenotypic
effect similar to deletion of the corresponding genes. This
however seems not to be the case, as both Δpfk2 and Δpyk2
strains exhibited increased resistance to 3-BP.
The most probable pathway of PKA influence on
3-BP susceptibility is connected with Whi2p phosphatase
and the mechanism of mitophagy. Cells without functional
Whi2p fail to enter the stationary phase. Whi2p was
suggested to be engaged in the cell cycle control, as Δwhi2
cells fail to enter G1 and arrest randomly within the cell
cycle in stationary phase [45]. These cells also fail to sense
nutritional deprivation, leading to continuous proliferation.
Sensitivity to 3-BP of the Δwhi2 which was visible even
when grown on medium with glucose, may be due to faulty
glucose-repression system in this mutant. Whi2p together
with Psr1p and Psr2p mediate the general response to
environmental stress through the Msn2p/Msn4p factors

Δwhi2 cells, resulting in reduced elimination of damaged
mitochondria [45]. This seems to be the most probable reason
for 3-BP-sensitivity of Δwhi2 and Δtpk1 (PKA) strains.
As the turnover of Jen1p was shown to be regulated
through phosphorylation by the Yck1p kinase [69], it was
possible that the phosphatase activity of Whi2p could
influence the activity of Jen1p. This however is not the
case, as the double Δjen1Δwhi2 mutant shows similar
increase in resistance to 3-BP comparing to the single
Δwhi2, as the Δjen1 mutant to wild-type.
Concluding, this study shows the multidirectional
influence of 3-BP on metabolism in yeast. The lack of
glucose-repression mechanism activity is crucial for 3-BP
toxicity, which is mainly due to ATP depletion. Glucose
present in the culturing medium, as well as genetic
disruption of the glucose-repression system decreases
toxic activity of 3-BP. Generally single deletions of genes
encoding the TCA cycle enzymes and mitochondrial
carriers cause sensitivity to 3-BP. Disruption of the
pentose phosphate pathway results in increased sensitivity
to 3-BP, probably due to the fact that PPP is a main source
of NADPH which provides the reducing potential for most
of the antioxidant agents, including glutathione. Most of
the effects on 3-BP-sensitivity of the single disruptions in
glycolytic and TCA pathways may probably be explained
by down- or upregulation of the gluconeogenesis and
pentose phosphate pathway and its influence on the
reducing buffer of the cell. Presence of yeast Whi2p
phosphatase is essential for resistance phenotype to 3-BP,
probably because of its interaction with glucose-repression
mechanism and the mitophagy of damaged mitochondria
through the Ras-cAMP-PKA pathway. It is noteworthy
that Whi2-mediated resistance to 3-BP does not occur
through the HOG stress response pathway. Moreover, the
effect of 3-BP resistance caused by disruption of the Jen1p
transporter disruption is independent of the sensitivity
effect caused by the deletion of WHI2 gene. The results
obtained in this study may help elucidate the mechanisms
of activity of 3-BP on glycolytic and TCA enzymes as
well as its influence on yeast mitochondria and glucose
repression system. However, further research is needed
concerning the influence of faulty mitophagy on 3-BP
toxicity. These findings may help to better understand the
toxic activity of 3-BP and improve its effectiveness as an
anticancer and antifungal drug.

Spot-test method

Determination of intracellular ATP levels in
yeast cells

To determine the MIC values (minimal inhibitory
concentrations) of a tested compound toward the selected
yeast strain and to compare the relative susceptibility of
several strains, the cells were grown to mid-log phase,
diluted to OD600≈0.25 and spotted (3 μl) in 10-fold serial
dilutions (100, 10-1, 10-2) onto the agar plates containing
various concentrations of a tested compound. Plates were
incubated at 28°C and photographed after 72 h, 96 h or
120 h, depending when the phenotypic effect was most
visible. The sensitivity assays were repeated a minimum of
three times. Differences in growth show variability of the
tested strain in their susceptibility to the tested inhibitor
[34]. Spot tests were performed on minimal (YNB)
medium with sucrose as a carbon source, unless stated
differently.

ATP level were determined for cells cultivated in
liquid SD medium with sucrose at 28°C. The 24h cultures
were diluted to optical density OD600 = 0.25 with fresh
SD medium. The cultures were then incubated in medium
with 1.8 mM and 3 mM 3-BP and as a control in medium
without 3-BP. At the start-point and after 1, 2, 3, 5 hours
of incubation, 50 μl of cell culture were lysed and the ATP
level was determined using the ATPlite™ Luminescence
Assay System (PerkinElmer) and PerkinElmer EnSpire®
Multimode Plate Reader. ATP levels at each time-point
were calculated as a percentage of the positive control
(without 3-BP) and were recalculated per living cells.
Viability of the cells at each time-point was determined
by plating a 100 μl sample of culture (using appropriate

Rho0 generation

Yeast colony PCR

To obtain the rho0 respiratory deficient mutant the
parental strain was incubated in liquid YP10 medium with
ethidium bromide (30 ug/ml) for 24 hours at 28°C. After
incubation cells were plated on the YPD medium. The
mutants were identified by colony size and confirmed by
the lack of growth on medium with glycerol (N3) [75].

Construction of yeast deletion-mutants

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Deletion mutants in the W303-1A background
were constructed using the method based on homologous
integration of disruption cassettes described by Wach et al.
[77]. The cassettes (KanMX6 and TRP1) were amplified
by PCR with gene-specific primers using the following
PCR program: 1:00 initial denaturation at 95°C, 30 cycles
of 0:30 95°C, 0:30 65°C, 1:00 72°C and final extension of
5:00 at 72°C. The PCR product was then used for highefficiency transformation of a specific yeast strain. Positive
transformants were isolated using selective media: SD-trp
for TRP1 cassette and YPD+G418 for KanMX6 cassette.
To confirm successful deletion of chosen genes, total
DNA was isolated from the transformed strain and control
PCR reactions were performed with gene- and cassettespecific primers using the following PCR program: 1:00
initial denaturation at 95°C, 30 cycles of 0:30 95°C, 0:30
55°C, 1:00 72°C and final extension of 5:00 at 72°C. PCR
were performed using Taq DNA Polymerase (Thermo
Scientific).

Search for multicopy suppressors of the resistant
phenotype using yeast genomic DNA library
FY1679-28C was transformed with genomic DNA
library (multicopy pFL44L plasmid) using high efficiency
transformation, plated on SD medium without uracil (100
plates) and incubated for 48 hours. Grown transformants
(200-300 colonies per plate) were then replicated on plates
with SD medium containing 3 mM 3-BP and incubated
for 120 hours. Total DNA was isolated from resistant
transformants and used for transformation of E.coli
JM109 to select and isolate plasmid DNA from total
DNA. Isolated plasmids were sequenced using M13FWD
and M13REV primers (Genomed, Warsaw, Poland) and
used for retransformation of yeast, to confirm the resistant
phenotype.
