BACKGROUND: Hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) chemotherapy delivers a high concentration of drugs both
to liver metastases and to healthy liver with specific, limiting, hepatobiliary toxicities. Relevant detoxification and cellular proliferation pathways are controlled by the molecular circadian clock in normal liver but
not in advanced tumors. In this article, the authors report their experience with chronomodulated HAI
chemotherapy as rescue therapy in heavily pretreated patients who had metastatic colorectal cancer.
METHODS: Data from all consecutive patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases who received HAI
with chronomodulated, multidrug chemotherapy regimens in the authors’ center after failure on standard
chemotherapy were reviewed for efficacy and safety. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were treated, including 76% with liver metastasis only and 24% with liver and lung metastases. Seventy-five percent of patients
had received 3 chemotherapy lines, including intravenous, chronomodulated chemotherapy in 59% of
patients. Patients received a median of 4 HAI courses (range, 1-9 courses). The most frequent grade
(according to National Cancer Institute of Canada Common Toxicity Criteria [version 3]) 3 and 4 nonhematologic toxicities were vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fatigue. No severe hematologic or hepatic
toxicities and no chemical cholangitis were reported. An objective tumor response was observed in 10
patients (34.5%), including 4 patients who subsequently underwent R0 or R1 hepatic resection. The median
progression-free survival and overall survival were 4.5 months (95% confidence limits, 2.4-6.5 months) and
18 months (95% confidence limits, 5.8-30.2 months), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: HAI chronomodulated
chemotherapy had well tolerated activity in selected, heavily pretreated patients, and the authors believe it

KEY WORDS: colorectal cancer, liver metastases, hepatic arterial infusion, chronotherapy, circadian
rhythms.

Metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC) are
limited to the liver in 30% to 60% of patients.1-3 Disease
progression in the liver leads to hepatic failure and contributes to mortality among patients with predominant
liver metastases.3 Hepatic resection is the only potentially
curative therapeutic option for these patients.4 Nearly all
patients who have metastatic disease and do not undergo
resection will die from their disease within 5 years.4,5 Systemic chemotherapy is the standard of care for patients
with unresectable metastatic disease. Intravenous (iv) 5fluorouracil/leucovorin (5-FU/LV)-based dual regimens
with either irinotecan or oxaliplatin have produced
increased median overall survival over treatment with 5FU/LV alone in patients with metastatic CRC.6-11 When
the liver is the single or prevalent disease site, hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) of cytotoxic drugs offers theoretical
advantages over standard iv administration. These include
the ability to deliver high drug concentrations and tumor
selectivity, because the major blood supply of macroscopic
tumors derives from the hepatic artery, whereas the blood
supply to normal liver mostly comes from the portal circulation.12 Original studies using fluoropyrimidine-based
chemotherapy produced higher response rates with HAI
compared with iv delivery but without demonstrating an
unequivocal survival advantage across studies. Nevertheless, 2 meta-analyses of the 7 original trials that were conducted in 600 patients who were registered identified
significant survival advantages for HAI over iv administration.13,14 Three additional studies were conducted,15-17
but only 1 trial confirmed an increased overall survival
with HAI.17 However, that study used a suboptimal reference therapy with single-agent, bolus 5-FU/LV. Finally
those studies did not define the exact role of HAI chemotherapy with 5-FU in the therapeutic strategy for metastatic CRC,18 and further investigations should be
encouraged with more active regimens.19 Irinotecan HAI
has been explored as a 5-day continuous infusion20,21 or
as a short 30-minute infusion.22,23 The data from those
explorations suggest that a higher rate of irinotecan conversion to its active metabolite SN-38 is achieved with

HAI delivery and that there is greater clinical activity with
short-duration HAI. Oxaliplatin HAI reportedly was feasible, and its combination with iv 5-FU-LV achieved a
high response rate in pretreated patients.24-29 Both the
terminal half-life of and the systemic exposure to free
plasma platinum were decreased by HAI of oxaliplatin, a
finding that supports its lower systemic toxicity compared
with iv administration.27 Such liver-directed chemotherapy
could benefit further from adjustment of the drug-delivery
pattern to the circadian clock in healthy hepatocytes.30
Normal mammalian cells contain a molecular clock
that regulates the cell cycle, apoptosis, gene expression,
and DNA repair.30-34 In contrast, cells in advanced
tumors have lost these clock-dependent rhythms.35,36 The
objective of chronomodulated chemotherapy is to take
advantage of the circadian differences between normal
cells and tumor cells by delivering high drug doses at times
when normal cells are relatively protected by low proliferative or metabolic activity, whereas tumor cells maintain
high metabolic and proliferative activities. In 2 randomized clinical studies, iv, chronomodulated chemotherapy
with 5-FU/LV and oxaliplatin reportedly delivered higher
dose intensity to improve tolerance and to increase efficacy (including overall survival in the first study) compared with the same regimen given at a constant rate of
infusion.36,37 Nevertheless, a recent, large, randomized
trial using individual dose escalation revealed a survival
advantage in men but not in women who received chronotherapy.38 The combination of both HAI and chronomodulated delivery of multidrug regimens could further
improve the therapeutic index of cytotoxic chemotherapy
in patients who have liver metastases from CRC. The
peak time of chronomodulated irinotecan at 5 AM corresponded to low proportion of S-phase cells in healthy tissues and to high Bcl-2 messenger RNA expression in oral
mucosa and, presumably, in other healthy tissues.39 The
peak time for the chronomodulated delivery of 5-FU at
4 AM corresponded to high intracellular activity of dehydropyrimidine dehydrogenase in healthy human blood
cells and to low DNA synthesis in healthy target tissues,

peak time for chronomodulated oxaliplatin at 4 PM corresponded to high reduced glutathione levels and high
circulating proteins in blood.40,42 In this article, we
report our initial experience using chronomodulated
HAI regimens in 29 consecutive patients with predominantly liver metastases from CRC who were referred to
our institution after the failure of standard treatments.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Objectives
The objective of this study was to retrospectively assess
the safety and efficacy of HAI chronomodulated chemotherapy in consecutive patients who had been pretreated
heavily for metastatic CRC.
Patient Selection
Data from all patients with histologically proven,
metastatic CRC, isolated (or predominant) hepatic
metastases, and failure on previous standard iv chemotherapy who received HAI with chronomodulated
chemotherapy in our center, were collected and analyzed retrospectively.
Study Treatment
5-FU was delivered in combination with irinotecan
and/or oxaliplatin through a hepatic arterial catheter
connected to a multichannel, programmable pump
(Mélodie, Aguettant, France) (Table 1). Courses were
repeated every 21 days or more according to patient
recovery from toxicities. Treatment was continued
until evidence of disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or patient refusal. No intravenous chemotherapy
was given simultaneously with HAI chronotherapy,
except for 2 patients who were receiving concurrent
intravenous cetuximab.

Assessment
Adverse events were collected and graded according to the
National Cancer Institute of Canada Common Toxicity
Criteria (version 3) on a standardized form before each
course of chemotherapy. Blood cell counts, biochemistry,
and tumor markers were obtained before each course. Tumor size was measured using computed tomography scans
after every third treatment course. Response was assessed
by a multidisciplinary team that included at least a radiologist, a hepatobiliary surgeon, and a medical oncologist,
according to the Response Criteria in Solid Tumors.
Hepatic surgery was attempted whenever the lesions were
deemed resectable after HAI therapy.

Statistical Analysis
Data were descriptive and are reported as percentages 
standard deviations or as the median and range. Timerelated parameters were reported using Kaplan-Meier
estimates.

RESULTS
Patients
Between March 2000 and September 2006, 29 consecutive patients met the selection criteria described previously
(Table 2). All patients had predominant metastatic liver
disease, 76% had exclusive hepatic metastases, and 24%
had both liver metastases and small lung deposits. Greater
than 50% of patients had bulky liver involvement estimated at >50% of the hepatic parenchyma. None of the
29 patients who were receiving HAI had their primary tumor left in place, and only a single patient underwent
resection of the primary tumor just before receiving HAI.
Most patients were heavily pretreated, including prior hepatic resection in 41% of patients. The median number of
previous chemotherapy lines for metastatic disease was

3 (range, 1-8 chemotherapy lines) and including prior
chronomodulated iv chemotherapy in 17 patients (58%)
and prior constant-rate HAI chemotherapy with floxuridine in 1 patient. All patients had received previous 5-FU/
LV and oxaliplatin, and 89% of patients had received previous irinotecan. All patients had progressive disease
before they received HAI, including 9 patients who had
an initial response (31%). Persistent sensory neuropathy
after previous oxaliplatin therapy was reported at baseline
in 21 patients (72%). The median interval between diagnosis of metastatic disease and onset of HAI chronotherapy was 17.7 months (25%-75% percentiles, 14.5-21.8).

Treatment
The catheter was placed in the hepatic artery through an
intercostal artery in 9 patients (31%) or during laparotomy in 20 patients (68%) for whom complete resection of
metastases was not possible. Twenty-four patients (83%)
received triple therapy with chronomodulated irinotecan,
oxaliplatin, and 5-FU. Four patients received HAI with
chronomodulated irinotecan and 5-FU (2 patients with
concomitant iv cetuximab). Two patients received chronomodulated 5-FU and oxaliplatin. One hundred thirtytwo cycles were administered (median, 4 cycles; range, 19 cycles). Treatment was discontinued because of adverse
events in 10 patients (34%) including catheter occlusion
or thrombosis after 2 to 9 cycles in 9 patients and severe
abdominal pain without evidence of thrombosis after 4
cycles in 1 patient.

in 21 patients (72.4%), and improved in 6 patients
(20.6%) during HAI. Neutropenia of any grade occurred
in 48.2% of patients, yet it reached grade 3 in only 1
patient. No episode of febrile neutropenia or neutropenic
infection was reported.
It is noteworthy that no chemical cholangitis was
reported. Compared with baseline values, transient alteration of liver function tests was reported in 9 patients
(34%). Thus, serum aminotransferase activity increased
by 3 to 95% in 8 patients, and alkaline phosphatase activity increased by 26 to 320% in 3 patients compared with
corresponding baseline values. It also is worth noting that
serum aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels
improved during HAI in the remaining group of patients.

Safety
There were no patient deaths because of toxicity. Relative
median dose intensities were 100% for irinotecan, 103%
for oxaliplatin, and 117% for 5-FU. The most frequent
grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity was abdominal
pain, which occurred in 13.8% of patients. Other grade 3
or 4 nonhematologic toxicities included diarrhea (10.3%)
and sensory neuropathy (3.4%) (Table 3). Sensory neuropathy of all grades was reported in 21 patients (72.4%)
during HAI chronomodulated chemotherapy. Nevertheless, 21 patients (72.4%) had pre-existing neuropathy at
baseline (including grade 3 in 4 patients) as a result of
prior oxaliplatin exposure (Table 2). The severity of neuropathy increased in 4 patients (13.8%), remained stable
4994

Efficacy
Ten patients (34.5%) experienced a partial response (PR),
8 patients (27.6%) had stable disease, and 11 patients
(37.9%) had progressive disease. Two of the 11 patients
who had outright progression of their disease had progressive lung metastases yet had an objective response in their
hepatic lesions. Two of the responding patients with lung
micrometastases demonstrated a major response in the
liver and stable lung disease. The characteristics of the 10
patients who achieved a PR are listed in Table 4. All
responding patients had a World Health Organization
performance status of 0 or 1. Neither concurrent lung

previous iv regimen precluded a response to HAI chronomodulated chemotherapy. Three of the patients who
attained a PR underwent further liver metastases resection
(R0 in 1 patient; R1 in 2 patients) and 1 patient with stable disease also underwent an R1 resection. The number
of HAI courses received before surgery by the 4 patients
who eventually underwent resection ranged from 3
courses (1 patient) to 5 courses (3 patients). One patient
received 2 additional courses of HAI after surgery (R1
resection; total number of HAI courses, 7). The overall
resection rate was 13.7% among 29 previously unresectable patients.
Histologically, important tumor regression with
minimal viable tumor remnants was observed in the
patient who underwent R0 resection and in the 1 patient
who underwent R1 resection. Nontumor liver parenchyma revealed minimal fibrosis in 2 patients without
vascular lesions or vascular modifications (nodular
hyperplasia with peliotic foci in 2 patients).
At a median follow-up of 53.5 months (range, 17.495.7 months), 28 patients had experienced tumor
progression, and 25 patients had died. The median progression-free survival was 4.5 months (range, 2.4-6.5
months) (Fig. 1), and the median overall survival was 18
months (range 5.8-30.2 months) since the start of HAI
(Fig. 2). The median overall survival of the 29 patients on
HAI chronotherapy was 36 months (range, 27.2-44.7
months) after the diagnosis of metastatic disease.

DISCUSSION
The outcome of patients with metastatic CRC has
improved greatly over the past 15 years as a result of the
introduction of new drugs and delivery schedules7-11 and
of a multidisciplinary approach with more aggressive surgical strategies.8,36-38,43,44 It is interesting to note that the
downstaging of unresectable liver metastases with modern
neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens has allowed potentially curative resection in up to 30% of patients across
published series.45 Furthermore, a recent analysis revealed
that pathologic a complete response to chemotherapy is a
major determinant of long-term survival and cure in
patients with metastatic CRC.44 Therefore, a pathologic
CR may represent a future surrogate endpoint.
In the current study, we attempted to deliver the
most aggressive treatment to persisting tumor cells

mainly or exclusively located in the liver by combining
the most active cytotoxic drugs, a hepatic arterial route
of drug administration, and chronotherapy. This therapeutic approach was given to heavily pretreated patients,
including 59% who had failed not only standard therapy but also iv chronotherapy. Thus, most patients
were refractory to several current standard therapeutic
options.
Our cohort study demonstrated that such an aggressive HAI therapy is feasible, well tolerated, and represents
an important rescue approach for selected patients. This
strategy can overcome drug resistance and even permit
further resection of metastasis and prolonged patient survival. Associated lung micrometastases, a frequent cause
of progressive disease for patients on HAI, remained stable
in 4 of 7 patients who were studied.
The specific toxicities of HAI consist of chemical
hepatitis and biliary sclerosis46-48 and are believed to be
the result of exposure of normal cells to high drug concentration, drug metabolism, and drug excretion. Although
the hepatic arterial route of administration favors drug
concentration in the tumor, healthy cells are not protected
adequately, particularly the bile duct cells during drug
excretion. The objective of chronotherapy is to further
protect healthy cells by taking advantage of their biologic
clock and exposing them to drugs when they are in a
period of relative rest in their metabolic and cell division

cycles.30,40 Furthermore, chronotherapy theoretically
should be more toxic to tumor cells because of poor circadian rhythm and greater cell cycle variability in malignant
tissues compared with healthy tissues.49
Although it has been demonstrated that HAI with
irinotecan or oxaliplatin is not complicated by cholangitis,20-29 it can be anticipated in as many as 30% of patients
who receive HAI floxuridine.46-48 This HAI chronotherapy regimen is well tolerated with no chemical bile
duct sclerosis, whereas chronotherapy is not expected to
decrease bile excretion of 5–FU metabolites. It is reasonable to hypothesize that healthy bile duct cells are protected
by chronotherapy or that HAI chronotherapy favors drug
metabolism into nontoxic metabolites within healthy
cells. Chemotherapy-induced cholangitis carries a poor
prognosis46-48; and the good locoregional tolerance demonstrated in the current study, if confirmed, in itself
would make chronomodulated HAI attractive. Chemotherapy-induced hepatitis was not clinically relevant, and
asymptomatic and transient elevation of liver enzymes
was observed in only 28% of patients.
Oxaliplatin-based iv chemotherapy reportedly was
responsible for severe sinusoidal obstruction syndrome,
which has unknown clinical significance, but some
possibly fatal cases have been reported.50-52 It has been
demonstrated that 5–fluorouracil and irinotecan are
responsible for hepatic steatosis and nonalcoholic

4996

steatohepatitis, which may increase postoperative morbidity.48,50,51 One concern is that higher intrahepatic
concentrations of oxaliplatin, 5–FU, and irinotecan
achieved by HAI would increase this histologic
toxicity. Histopathologic examination of healthy liver
in the 4 patients who underwent subsequent liver
resection did not demonstrate such increased toxicity.
It is interesting to note that, in the current study, oxaliplatin-related sensory neuropathy was aggravated in
only 13.8% of patients but was stable in the majority of
patients or even improved in 20.6%. This good tolerance may have been caused by the higher hepatic clearance of oxaliplatin administered by HAI administration
versus iv administration and the subsequently lower systemic exposure shown in an animal model.53 However,
previous publications in humans have reported relatively
small variations in systemic exposure after HAI oxaliplatin27 and a 42% to 48% incidence of neuropathy with
HAI oxaliplatin.27,29 Thus, multidrug chronomodulated
HAI represents an active treatment modality for
patients with metastatic CRC whose disease has become
resistant to all intravenously active drugs. HAI chronotherapy may offer the greatest long-term survival benefit
in patients with liver-only disease that remains unresectable or in patients who demonstrate disease progression
after first-line or second-line iv chemotherapy regimens.
In conclusion, the results of the current study show
that chronomodulated HAI multidrug chemotherapy is
feasible and well tolerated and demonstrates antitumor activity in selected, heavily pretreated patients. Chronomodulated HAI deserves to be assessed prospectively in
clinical trials that involve patients with earlier stage disease
and compared with conventional approaches. Currently,
novel interventional catheters have been designed especially for HAI and represent technical progress that favors
the safe development of this treatment method. Thus, an
ongoing European trial currently is investigating the
potential of conventional or chronomodulated HAI triplet chemotherapy combined with intravenous cetuximab
to increase the rate of complete resection of liver metastases from colorectal cancer.
