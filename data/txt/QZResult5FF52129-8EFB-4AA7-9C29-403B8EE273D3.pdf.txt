Abstract
Imatinib and other BCR-ABL1 inhibitors are effective therapies for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), but
these inhibitors target additional kinases including KIT, raising the question of whether off-target effects
contribute to clinical efﬁcacy. On the basis of its involvement in CML pathogenesis, we hypothesized that KIT may
govern responses of CML cells to imatinib. To test this, we assessed the growth of primary CML progenitor cells
under conditions of sole BCR-ABL1, sole KIT, and dual BCR-ABL1/KIT inhibition. Sole BCR-ABL1 inhibition
suppressed mature CML progenitor cells, but these effects were largely abolished by stem cell factor (SCF) and
maximal suppression required dual BCR-ABL1/KIT inhibition. In contrast, KIT inhibition did not add to the
effects of BCR-ABL1 inhibition in primitive progenitors, represented by CD34þ38 cells. Long-term cultureinitiating cell assays on murine stroma revealed profound depletion of primitive CML cells by sole BCR-ABL1
inhibition despite the presence of SCF, suggesting that primitive CML cells are unable to use SCF as a survival
factor upon BCR-ABL1 inhibition. In CD34þ38þ cells, SCF strongly induced pAKTS473 in a phosphoinositide 3kinase (PI3K)–dependent manner, which was further enhanced by inhibition of BCR-ABL1 and associated with
increased colony survival. In contrast, pAKTS473 levels remained low in CD34þ38 cells cultured under the same
conditions. Consistent with reduced response to SCF, KIT surface expression was signiﬁcantly lower on CD34þ
38 compared with CD34þ38þ CML cells, suggesting a possible mechanism for the differential effects of SCF on
mature and primitive CML progenitor cells. Cancer Res; 73(18); 5775–86. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
The BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), imatinib,
induces profound responses in most patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CMLCP; ref. 1). Imatinib inhibition of BCR-ABL1 correlates with
response, and reactivation of BCR-ABL1 signaling by kinase
point mutations with relapse (2). In addition to BCR-ABL1,
imatinib targets the tyrosine kinases ABL1, KIT, ARG (ABL2),
DDR1/2, PDGFR, CSF-1R, and LCK (2–4). In contrast to BCRABL1, we detected no mutations in KIT or platelet-derived
growth factor receptor (PDGFR) in patients with imatinib
resistance (5).

Imatinib's capacity to inhibit non-BCR-ABL1 targets has
expanded its use to malignancies driven by mutations of KIT or
PDGFR (6, 7), but inhibition of physiologic kinase signaling
within normal cells may be the cause of side effects such as
anemia (8), myelosuppression (9), and ﬂuid retention (10). It is
largely unknown whether coinhibition of non-BCR-ABL1 targets within CML cells has therapeutic beneﬁts.
KIT has been implicated in CML pathogenesis. BCR-ABL1–
expressing progenitors were shown to be hypersensitive to
stem cell factor (SCF) due to BCR-ABL1–induced upregulation
of its receptor, KIT (11, 12) and SCF was reported to support
growth of cytokine-dependent CML but not normal progenitors (13). Furthermore, culture of CML stem and progenitor
cells on SCF-deﬁcient stroma favors normal progenitors, suggesting that CML progenitors may be more SCF responsive
than their normal counterparts (14). Accordingly, KIT-expressing BCR-ABL1–transduced murine myeloid cells were less
sensitive to sole inhibition of either BCR-ABL1 or KIT compared with simultaneous inhibition of both kinases (15). In
primary CML CD34þ cells, SCF reduced apoptosis in response
to nilotinib (16), but it is unknown which speciﬁc pathways are
activated by SCF to confer relative TKI resistance, and whether
the requirement for KIT inhibition extends to more primitive
CML cells. We sought to determine the contribution of KIT
inhibition to the effects of TKIs on CML cells at various
differentiation stages. We ﬁnd that dual inhibition of BCRABL1 and KIT is required for suppression of mature but not

primitive CML progenitors. This differential effect is due to the
inability of primitive CML cells to activate AKT in response to
SCF upon inhibition of BCR-ABL1.

Materials and Methods
Patient samples
Bone marrow or leukapheresis was obtained from patients
with newly diagnosed CML-CP. All patients provided informed
consent to research protocols approved by the Institutional
Review Boards of the participating institutions. Normal bone
marrow mononuclear cells (MNC) were from AllCells. Cell
selection was as described previously (details in Supplementary Methods; ref. 17).
Inhibition of BCR-ABL1, KIT, MEK, and PI3K
Sole BCR-ABL1 inhibition was achieved with PPY-A (a gift of
ARIAD Pharmaceuticals; ref. 18). Sole KIT inhibition was
achieved by three methods: (i) use of a SCF-blocking antibody
K44.2 (SCF-block; Sigma-Aldrich), a human-speciﬁc antibody
that binds extracellularly to KIT and prevents SCF-induced
dimerization; (ii) BAW667, a small molecule that targets KIT
but not BCR-ABL1, the chemical structure of which is still
proprietary. The activity proﬁle of BAW667 was determined as
previously described (19, 20) and is provided in Supplementary
Table S1. Requests to obtain BAW667 should be directed to
Paul Manley, Novartis; (iii) downregulation of KIT using a
lentivirally delivered short hairpin RNA (shRNA) construct.
Dual BCR-ABL1/KIT inhibition was achieved with imatinib
or a combination of PPY-AþSCF-block, BAW667, or KIT
shRNA. Mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal–regulated kinase (MEK) inhibition was achieved with PD98059 (Cell
Signaling Technology) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)
inhibition with LY294002 (Cell Signaling Technology). For
details on vector construction, see Supplementary Methods.
Immunoblot analysis of cell lines and patient samples
Analysis of primary cells and cell lines was as previously
published (17, 21). For details and a list of antibodies, see
Supplementary Methods.
Colony assays
Hematopoietic colony-forming assays were conducted as
described previously (17). For details, see Supplementary
Methods.
Long-term culture-initiating cell assays
Murine M210B4 stromal cells plated at 5  104 cells per well
in a 24-well format were irradiated with 40 Gy. A total of 104
Lin-depleted CML cells were cultured in triplicate wells in longterm culture-initiating cell (LTC-IC) media [Iscove's Modiﬁed
Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM), horse serum, FBS, and hydrocortisone] in the following conditions: untreated, 2 mmol/L
imatinib, 1 mmol/L PPY-A, 200 ng/mL SCF-block, 1 mmol/L
PPY-A þ 200 ng/mL SCF-block. The medium was supplemented with 5 ng/mL human SCF. Half medium changes were
carried out weekly and included inhibitors at the relevant
concentrations. At intervals of 1, 3, and 6 weeks, cells were
detached with trypsin, plated in cytokine-supplemented meth-

ylcellulose (STEMCELL Technologies), and colony-forming
cells (CFC) were analyzed at 2 weeks. CFC frequencies for all
patients are reported relative to starting cell number. Individual colonies (10 per condition or as many as available) were
genotyped by FISH using a dual-color/dual-fusion BCR-ABL1
LSI probe (Abbott Molecular; ref. 17). Phþ CFC relative to
untreated are reported.
Cell proliferation assays
Viable cells were quantiﬁed using MTS as described previously (21). For details, see Supplementary Methods.
Flow-cytometric analysis of KIT expression
CD34þ cells were labeled with CD117/KIT-PerCP-Cy5.5, LinFITC, CD34-APC, and CD38-PE antibodies (BD Biosciences)
and mean ﬂuorescence intensity of CD117 in LinCD34þ38þ
and LinCD34þ38 cells was measured.
Immunoﬂuorescence
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-sorted CD34þ or
CD34þ38þ and CD34þ38 cells were incubated with or without
PPY-A (1 mmol/L) for 2 hours, followed by SCF (25 ng/mL) for
30 minutes. Cells were cytospun onto glass slides, ﬁxed with
paraformaldehyde (4% in PBS), permeabilized with methanol,
and blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin at 4 C for 18 hours.
Slides were incubated with pAKTS473 antibody (Cell Signaling
Technology) or pERK1/2Y202/204 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) overnight, washed twice for 5 minutes with PBS,
stained with an Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (Invitrogen) for 2
hours, washed three times with PBS, stained with Hoechst
stain, covered with ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen)
and coverslip, and allowed to cure overnight. Fluorescent
images were then taken with a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope
using a CRI NUANCE multispectral imaging system with
identical exposure time for each slide. Images were compiled
using IP Lab and Adobe Photoshop software.
Quantitative real-time PCR for SCF
Details are described in Supplementary Methods.

Results
Imatinib inhibits both BCR-ABL1 and KIT, PPY-A
inhibits BCR-ABL1 but not KIT, and BAW667 inhibits KIT
but not BCR-ABL1
We initially determined the speciﬁcity of imatinib, dasatinib,
PPY-A (18), BAW667 (a compound with activity against KIT,
but not BCR-ABL1), and a SCF-block. SCF-stimulated Mo7e or
Mo7ep210BCR-ABL1 cells were treated with inhibitors at concentrations reported to effectively inhibit BCR-ABL1 (if applicable; refs. 18, 22) and cell lysates were immunoblotted for
pKITY721 or pBCR-ABL1. SCF-block was titrated against KIT
to determine an appropriate working concentration (not
shown). Imatinib (2 mmol/L) and dasatinib (50 nmol/L) inhibited both BCR-ABL1 and KIT, whereas PPY-A (1 mmol/L) only
inhibited pBCR-ABL1 and BAW667 (1 mmol/L) only inhibited
pKITY721 (Fig. 1A). No KIT inhibition was seen with 10 mmol/L
PPY-A, whereas 10 mmol/L BAW667 slightly reduced pBCRABL1 (Supplementary Fig. S1). We concluded that PPY-A and

1 mmol/L PPY-A, or 200 ng/mL SCF-block  SCF stimulation as indicated. Lysates were immunoblotted for pCRKL or pKITY721. Total CRKL and total KIT are
shown as loading controls. One representative experiment is shown. Dasatinib was not tested because of cell number limitations.

BAW667 at 1 mmol/L selectively inhibit BCR-ABL1 or KIT,
respectively. SCF-block at 200 ng/mL suppressed KIT phosphorylation without affecting BCR-ABL1 activity. Similar
results were obtained in CD34þ CML cells, using CRKL as a
marker for BCR-ABL1 activity (Fig. 1B). KIT was phosphorylated in CML CD34þ cells in the absence of SCF and this
phosphorylation was reduced by imatinib or BAW667, but not
PPY-A, suggesting that some KIT activation occurs without
SCF, independent of BCR-ABL1 kinase activity. The band
corresponding to pKITY721 was not completely suppressed in
CML CD34þ cells under any conditions, including imatinib and
BAW667 treatment, suggesting that a kinase other than BCRABL1 or KIT may maintain a low level of KIT phosphorylation
in primary CML cells.

Dual inhibition of BCR-ABL1 and KIT is required for
maximal suppression of CFU-GM colony formation by
CML CD34þ cells
We initially compared colony-forming unit, granulocytemacrophage (CFU-GM) colony formation upon sole BCR-ABL1
inhibition (PPY-A), sole KIT inhibition (SCF-block), or dual
BCR-ABL1/KIT inhibition (imatinib or PPY-AþSCF-block).
Cells were plated in interleukin (IL)-3, granulocyte macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and SCF. Unlike imatinib,
which reduced colonies by approximately 80%, PPY-A suppressed CFU-GM colony formation by only approximately 30%
and SCF-block by approximately 50% (Fig. 2A). Dual BCR-ABL1
and KIT inhibition by PPY-A and SCF-block, however, reduced
colony numbers by approximately 80%, suggesting that both

were assessed in samples from
newly diagnosed CML-CP patients
(left) or normal MNCs (right)
cultured for 14 days in semisolid
medium containing IL-3, GM-CSF,
and SCF. Imatinib, PPY-A, SCFblock, or PPY-AþSCF-block were
added as indicated. Mean colony

normalized relative to untreated for
n ¼ 4 samples. Error bars represent
SEM. B, CFU-GM colonies from
untreated and PPY-A–treated
plates were pooled and lysates
were immunoblotted for pCRKL to
assess BCR-ABL1 activity (n ¼ 3).
Total CRKL is shown as a loading
control. A representative
immunoblot is shown.

BCR-ABL1 and SCF/KIT contribute independently to colony
growth. Normal CFU-GM colony formation was unaffected by
sole BCR-ABL1 inhibition (PPY-A), but suppressed by imatinib
or SCF-block, consistent with dependence on KIT signaling.
The lack of efﬁcacy of PPY-A was not due to drug instability, as
pCRKL was inhibited in PPY-A–treated colonies harvested
following the culture period (Fig. 2B). We also tested inhibitor
effects on blast-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) colony formation. PPY-A had no effect, whereas sole SCF-block reduced
BFU-E colony numbers to those observed with imatinib (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Thus, CML erythroid colony growth is
independent of BCR-ABL1 and its suppression by imatinib is
due entirely to KIT inhibition. Responses of normal BFU-E
were identical, conﬁrming that growth inhibition was cell-type
rather than CML-speciﬁc. The insensitivity of CML BFU-E to
PPY-A is not due to autocrine SCF production, as SCF is not
expressed by CML CD34þ cells and not induced by PPY-A
(Supplementary Fig. S2B).
In a second independent series of experiments, we included
BAW667 and shKIT as alternative means of suppressing KIT
activity. CD34þ cells from patients with CML or normal controls were plated with or without SCF and BAW667, PPY-A,
BAW667þPPY-A, or imatinib were added (Fig. 3A). SCF increased CML and normal CFU-GM colonies by approximately
2.1-fold and approximately 1.7-fold, respectively. BAW667
abrogated the colony increase imparted by SCF in CML and
normal cells. In addition, BAW667 reduced CML colony formation in the absence of SCF by approximately 50%, whereas
effects on normal colonies were minimal, suggesting that KIT is
constitutively active in CML but not normal progenitor cells
and contributes to their growth. PPY-A inhibited colony formation by CML progenitor cells, and this was partially rescued
by SCF, but had no effect on normal progenitor cells. Combination of PPY-A and BAW667 had effects similar to imatinib.
To speciﬁcally inhibit KIT without concerns about possible offtarget effects of biochemical inhibitors, we used a lentiviral

5778

Cancer Res; 73(18) September 15, 2013

vector for simultaneous expression of shKIT and GFP in
human cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). Without SCF, shKIT had
little effect on normal cells, but reduced colony formation of
CML CD34þ cells by approximately 45% (Fig. 3B), similar to
BAW667 alone (Fig. 3A). shKIT also abrogated the increase in
colony formation caused by SCF in both normal and CML
CD34þ cells. Finally, combining shKIT and PPY-A had similar
effects as PPY-AþBAW667 or imatinib. Altogether these data
show that CML CD34þ progenitor cells are slightly more
responsive to SCF than normal CD34þ cells and that KIT is
intrinsically active in CML but not normal cells. As a result, KIT
inhibition differentiates between normal and CML CD34þ
progenitor cells in the presence and absence of SCF, and this
differential is further increased by inhibition of BCR-ABL1.
For additional validation, we analyzed CML CFU-GM colony
growth following removal of the individual cytokines SCF, GMCSF, or IL-3. We found that removal of SCF had the most
pronounced effect; combining SCF removal with PPY-A had
effects comparable with imatinib, suggesting that the differential sensitivity of CML CFU-GM to imatinib and PPY-A is due
exclusively to their differential effects on KIT (Supplementary
Fig. S4A and S4B). It should be noted that some colony growth
is due to IL-3 or GM-CSF, evidenced by an approximately 15%
reduction of colony growth upon removal of IL-3 or GM-CSF in
the presence of PPY-A (Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B).
Removal of individual cytokines did not enhance PPY-A effects
against BFU-E colony formation (Supplementary Fig. S4C),
unsurprisingly given our ﬁnding that these cells are dependent
on KIT but not BCR-ABL1.
Dual inhibition of BCR-ABL1 and KIT is required to
suppress CML progenitor cell growth, whereas sole BCRABL1 inhibition is sufﬁcient to suppress CML stem cell
growth
Because BCR-ABL1 and KIT signaling both contribute to
survival of CML progenitor cells, we determined whether this

was also the case for more primitive CML cells, using immunophenotype or functional capacity to distinguish between
mature and primitive CML progenitor cells. LinCD34þ38þ
(representing relatively mature progenitor cells) and
LinCD34þ38 cells (representing a primitive population,
including stem cells; ref. 17) from newly diagnosed patients
with CML-CP were plated in semisolid medium supplemented
with 1 mmol/L PPY-A, 1 mmol/L BAW667, or a combination
thereof (Fig. 4A). KIT inhibition with BAW667 reduced colony
formation by approximately 49% in progenitor cells and
approximately 42% in primitive cells, respectively. In contrast,
isolated BCR-ABL1 inhibition (PPY-A) had a more signiﬁcant
effect on primitive cells (87% reduction) than on mature
progenitor cells (58% reduction). Combining KIT and BCRABL1 inhibition increased inhibition of progenitor cells by 27%
to approximately 76%, whereas inhibition of primitive cells was
only mildly increased by about 8% to approximately 95%.
We also plated CML progenitors on murine stroma for 1, 3,
or 6 weeks in the presence of PPY-A, SCF-block or both.

Although precise assignment of these populations to a speciﬁc
differentiation stage is difﬁcult, the progressively longer duration of culture permits expansion and maturation of increasingly primitive cells that are quantiﬁed by CFC assays as a
composite readout for survival, expansion, and maturation
(23). Resulting colonies were genotyped for BCR-ABL1 by FISH.
Neither sole BCR-ABL1 (PPY-A) nor sole inhibition of KIT
(SCF-block) achieved the CFC suppression seen with dual
inhibition by imatinib or PPY-AþSCF-block in week 1 and 3
colonies (Fig. 4B and C). In 6-week LTC-IC, representative of
primitive CML progenitors and stem cells, sole BCR-ABL1
inhibition achieved more than 95% suppression of Phþ CFC
(Fig. 4D) and was comparable with imatinib (P ¼ 0.8), whereas
minimal growth suppression of 6-week LTC-IC was observed
with SCF-block (Fig. 4E). Dependence on BCR-ABL1 and KIT
progressively increased or decreased, respectively, with duration of growth on murine stroma (Fig. 4E). FISH revealed a mix
of CML and LTC-IC, typical of early CML-CP (24). Although
growth suppression was variable between patients and in some

instances the absolute number of surviving colonies was small,
Phþ colonies were observed in all treatment conditions. Either
imatinib or PPY-A, but not SCF-block increased the proportion
of Ph 6-week LTC-IC relative to untreated (Fig. 4F). Altogether
these data suggest that primitive cells are less dependent on
KIT and more dependent on BCR-ABL1 and that the capacity
of KIT signaling to rescue CML cells in the presence of sole
BCR-ABL1 inhibition is largely restricted to mature CML
progenitors.
Differences in sensitivity to KIT inhibition may depend
on KIT expression
KIT has been implicated in CML pathogenesis, but it is not
precisely known how KIT and BCR-ABL1 signaling interact and
whether any such interaction may depend on the differentiation stage of the cells (12). Figures 1B and 3A and B show that
KIT is constitutively active in CML CD34þ cells in the absence
of SCF, and that inhibition of KIT activity alone reduces colony
growth, showing that KIT contributes to CML progenitor cell
growth independently of SCF. To conﬁrm this, we infected
bone marrow from 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU)–treated mice with
retrovirus for simultaneous expression of BCR-ABL1, GFP, and
shKIT or scrambled shRNA. Equal numbers of GFP-positive
(GFPþ) cells were plated in colony assays with or without SCF.

KIT shRNA signiﬁcantly reduced colony formation in the
absence and presence of SCF, conﬁrming that KIT is involved
in BCR-ABL1 transformation irrespective of receptor engagement by ligand (Fig. 5A–D).
To further characterize interactions of KIT and BCR-ABL1
signaling, we used Mo7ep210BCR-ABL1 cells. SCF rescued
Mo7ep210BCR-ABL1 cells treated with PPY-A (Fig. 6A), similar
to colony assays of CML CD34þ cells (Fig. 3A). Because KIT
signals through several canonical pathways including PI3K
and MEK (reviewed in ref. 25), we tested how BCR-ABL1
and KIT signaling inﬂuence activation of these pathways.
Mo7ep210BCR-ABL1 cells were treated with SCF  prior PPY-A
inhibition of BCR-ABL1 signaling. In the presence of active
BCR-ABL1, KIT activation of AKT (downstream of PI3K) and
ERK1/2 (downstream of MEK) was weak and short-lived.
In contrast, strong and sustained activation of AKT and
ERK1/2 occurred when BCR-ABL1 was inhibited (Fig. 6B).
Activation of AKT was associated with a reduction of Foxo3A
(Supplementary Fig. S5). Cotreatment with a PI3K inhibitor
(LY294002) completely and cotreatment with a MEK inhibitor (PD98059) partially inhibited SCF-mediated proliferation, suggesting that the SCF signal is transmitted mainly via
PI3K/AKT and enhanced by BCR-ABL1 inhibition (Fig. 6C).
To validate this ﬁnding in primary CML cells, we conducted

CD34þ cells treated with SCF  prior PPY-A treatment.
PPY-A alone or SCF alone had moderate impact on
pAKTS473 and pERK1/2Y202/204 (Fig. 6D). However, both were
strongly induced by simultaneous treatment with PPY-A and
SCF, conﬁrming the results in Mo7ep210BCR-ABL1 cells (Fig. 6B).
Inhibition of PI3K (50 mmol/L LY294002) completely and
inhibition of MEK (20 mmol/L PD98059) partially rescued the
SCF effect (Fig. 6E), validating the data on Mo7ep210BCR-ABL1
cells (Fig. 6C). Altogether these results show that SCF rescues
CML CD34þ progenitor cells upon inhibition of BCR-ABL1,
mainly via PI3K/AKT, which explains why dual inhibition of
KIT and BCR-ABL1 is required to effectively target these cells.
We next examined possible differences in signaling response
to SCF between mature (CD34þ38þ) and primitive (CD34þ38)
progenitor cells. CD34þ cells were cultured overnight in BIT
medium without cytokines and sorted, treated with SCF, PPYA, or both, and then analyzed by immunoﬂuorescence for

pAKTS473 (Fig. 7A). pAKTS473 was lower in CD34þ38 cells than
CD34þ38þ cells, as previously reported (17). PPY-A alone
minimally reduced pAKTS473 in CD34þ38þ cells. Strikingly,
SCF strongly induced pAKTS473 in PPY-A–treated CD34þ38þ
cells, analogous to Mo7ep210BCR-ABL1 cells (Fig. 6B), but had
little effect in CD34þ38 cells, suggesting that upon BCR-ABL1
inhibition CD34þ38 CML cells fail to launch a robust
pAKTS473 response to SCF stimulation. To identify the underlying mechanism, we measured CD117 (KIT) expression on
LinCD34þ38þ versus LinCD34þ38 cells and found significantly lower expression in the primitive LinCD34þ38 cells,
which may explain their decreased response to SCF and greater
vulnerability to sole BCR-ABL1 inhibition (Fig. 7B).

Discussion
Previous studies have implicated KIT in CML pathogenesis,
suggesting that the efﬁcacy of TKIs such as imatinib may be

due to their combined activity against BCR-ABL1 and KIT
(13, 15, 26). For example, KITþ BCR-ABL1–transduced murine
progenitor cells are more sensitive to dual inhibition of KIT and
BCR-ABL1 than to inhibition of either kinase individually (15).
In another study, SCF rescued CML CD34þ cells from nilotinib
but not imatinib effects and ascribed the difference to nilotinib's relatively weaker anti-KIT activity (16). However, it
remained unknown which speciﬁc pathways are activated by
SCF to confer relative TKI resistance and whether the requirement for KIT inhibition depends on the stage of differentiation.
Here, we use TKIs, shRNA and blocking antibodies to examine
whether the complimentary activity of imatinib against both
BCR-ABL1 and KIT contributes to its efﬁcacy in mature and
primitive primary CML cells.
Sole BCR-ABL1 inhibition with PPY-A modestly suppressed
CML CFU-GM colony formation in the presence of cytokines,
whereas SCF-block caused a slightly more pronounced reduction (Fig. 2A). This reduction was not exclusively dependent on
active SCF signaling, as SCF-block (Fig. 2A) or removal of SCF
(Supplementary Fig. S4A) had quantitatively similar effects to
BAW667 (Fig. 3A) or shKIT knockdown in SCF-free cultures
(Fig. 3B). These data show that KIT contributes to the proliferation of mature CML progenitors in the absence of ligand, in
accord with previous reports in BCR-ABL1–expressing cell
lines (12). Consistent with this, we detected low levels of
pKITY721 in serum-starved CML CD34þ cells that was reduced
by imatinib and BAW667 (Fig. 1B). The effects of BAW667
inhibition of KIT were maximal in cultures of CML CD34þ cells
that were supplemented with SCF (Fig. 3A, left: compare dark
bars in control vs. BAW667). Expression of BCR-ABL1 with or
without simultaneous KIT knockdown in murine bone marrow
(Fig. 5) reproduced the data on primary human CML cells,
indicating that both SCF-induced and -independent KIT activation contribute to CML progenitor cell growth. Surprisingly,
shKIT signiﬁcantly enhanced the effects of PPY-A on CML
CD34þ colony formation in the absence of SCF (Fig. 3B, top).
This could reﬂect persistence of a low level of BCR-ABL1 kinase
activity not detected by pCRKL immunoblots (27) or constitutive KIT activation that is independent of BCR-ABL1 kinase
activity. In addition, the band corresponding to pKITY721 was
not completely abolished by BAW667 or imatinib (Fig. 1B),
suggesting that a kinase other than BCR-ABL1 or KIT may
phosphorylate KIT on tyrosine 721, although this residue is
generally regarded as an autophosphorylation site. For example, SRC family kinases have been shown to phosphorylate
tyrosine 900 of KIT (28). Additional studies will be required to
distinguish between these two possibilities.
In contrast to the limited effects of targeting either BCRABL1 or KIT in isolation, simultaneous inhibition of both
kinases dramatically reduced CML CFU-GM growth. Disruption of KIT signaling was achieved with four independent
approaches (BAW667, SCF-block, SCF removal, and KIT
knockdown), all of which produced similar effects when combined with the BCR-ABL1 inhibitor PPY-A. Dual dependence of
primary CML progenitor cells on BCR-ABL1 and KIT signaling
is restricted to granulocyte precursors. Although erythroid
progenitors express both BCR-ABL1 and KIT (29), erythroid
colony formation was maximally suppressed by inhibition of

5784

Cancer Res; 73(18) September 15, 2013

KIT alone and independent of BCR-ABL1 activity, identical to
normal BFU-E (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Thus, imatinib suppression of leukemic BFU-E is due entirely to KIT inhibition
and BCR-ABL1 expression in erythroid lineage cells is not
synonymous with dependence on BCR-ABL1 (30). Accordingly,
erythrocytosis is not a feature of CML.
Unlike the balanced contribution of BCR-ABL1 and KIT
inhibition to suppression of CFU-GM colonies, effects on
primitive CML cells, deﬁned either by a CD34þ38 phenotype
(Fig. 4A) or LTC-IC functionality (Fig. 4B) were mostly due to
BCR-ABL1 inhibition. In particular, in 6-week LTC-IC assays,
which select primitive CML progenitor cells (23), both imatinib
and PPY-A reduced Phþ LTC-IC colonies by more than 95%,
consistent with an effect that requires inhibition of BCR-ABL1,
but not KIT. On the surface, the capacity of sole BCR-ABL1
inhibition to suppress primitive CML cells seems to contradict
reports by us and others that that CML stem cells are insensitive to BCR-ABL1 inhibitors (17, 31). Furthermore, previous
studies reported only modest imatinib effects on CML LTC-IC
(32, 33). The differences are readily explained by the fact that
prior studies evaluated the effects of short-term (72–96 hours)
drug treatment of CML progenitors followed by 6-week culture
on stroma without TKIs. These assays show the inability of
TKIs to effectively induce apoptosis in primitive cells, but do
not reﬂect conditions of long-term imatinib treatment. In
contrast, we examined how continuous suppression of BCRABL1, KIT, or their combination throughout the 6-week culture
period would affect LTC-IC outgrowth. Importantly, to generate an environment devoid of human cytokines, we conducted
the LTC-IC assays using unmanipulated murine (M210B4)
stromal cells (i.e., not engineered to express human cytokines).
Because most cytokines and chemokines are not cross-reactive
between species (34), these conditions minimize extrinsic
factors that might support CML stem cells despite BCR-ABL1
inhibition. In these conditions, imatinib and PPY-A resulted in
profound suppression of the most primitive cells. Notably, the
differential effects of sole BCR-ABL1 versus sole KIT inhibition
on mature versus primitive CML progenitor cells were consistent irrespective of whether the cell populations were
deﬁned by immunophenotype (Fig. 4A) or functionality (Fig.
4B–F). Given the overall profound effect of sole BCR-ABL1
inhibition on primitive CML progenitor cells, it is impossible to
exclude a small contribution of KIT inhibition to the suppression of this population. Despite small numbers of colonies, in
all samples Phþ LTC-IC survived in the presence of BCR-ABL1
inhibitors, consistent with reports of residual BCR-ABL1þ
LTC-IC and CD34þ38 cells in patients with sustained molecular response to imatinib (35, 36).
The differential sensitivity of mature and primitive CML
progenitors to sole BCR-ABL1 versus combined BCR-ABL1/
KIT inhibition suggested cell type–speciﬁc differences in the
response to SCF. We initially studied Mo7ep210BCR-ABL1 cells
and found that SCF rescued these cells from the effects of PPYA inhibition of BCR-ABL1 (Fig. 6A). Although active BCR-ABL1
blunted SCF activation of AKT and MEK, key pathways downstream of KIT (25), inhibition of BCR-ABL1 sensitized cells to
SCF. SCF rescue was completely blocked by PI3K inhibition,
but only partially by MEK inhibition, implicating PI3K/AKT as

Dual BCR-ABL1 and KIT Inhibition Suppresses CML

the critical pathway downstream of KIT (Fig. 6C). Similar
results were obtained in primary CML CD34þ cells: whereas
PPY-A or SCF alone had little effect on pAKTS473, their combination greatly increased pAKTS473 (Fig. 6D). LY294002 abrogated the SCF-induced increase in colony formation (Fig. 6E).
In contrast, basal pAKTS473 in CD34þ38 cells was low, as
previously reported in BCR-ABL1–expressing murine stem
cells and CD34þ38 CML cells (17, 37), unchanged upon
PPY-A treatment and minimally increased by SCF alone or in
combination with PPY-A (Fig. 7A). This is in stark contrast to
CD34þ38þ CML cells (Fig. 6D) and suggests that the PPY-A
sensitivity of CD34þ38 CML cells is due to their inability
to strongly activate SCF signaling upon BCR-ABL1 inhibition, possibly reﬂecting the lower CD117 expression on
CD34þ38 compared with CD34þ38þ CML cells (Fig. 7B). As
the most primitive CML cells are not strongly KIT dependent,
this may explain why no KIT mutations have been observed in
patients with imatinib resistance (5). Additional mechanisms
may be involved in blunting the SCF response of primitive
CML progenitor cells in vivo. For example, Naka and colleagues
reported that TGF-b blocks BCR-ABL1–induced AKT activation in BCR-ABL1–transduced murine stem cells (37). Because
TGF-b is reported to prevent SCF rescue of mast cells after
IL-3 withdrawal (38), it is possible that TGF-b in the microenvironment may further reduce SCF-induced rescue of
CD34þ38 CML cells.
From the drug development perspective, it is important to
consider whether there is beneﬁt to inhibiting nononcogenic
targets, or whether "surgical" inhibitors with the narrowest
possible target spectrum are preferred. Among the second- and
third-generation BCR-ABL1 inhibitors, dasatinib, nilotinib,
and ponatinib directly inhibit KIT, whereas bosutinib has no
activity against KIT (39). The clinical activity of bosutinib (40,
41) can be explained by its inhibitory activity toward SRC
kinases, which play a critical role in KIT signaling (42, 43).
Altogether our data suggest that, in vivo, CML stem cells may
survive BCR-ABL1 inhibition through a pathway other than
SCF/KIT that is not activated by M210B4 stromal cells. Therefore, the TKI resistance of primitive CML cells may simply
reﬂect the fact that these inhibitors fail to target a second
critical pathway, in contrast to the fortuitous situation in

mature progenitor cells. Identifying pathways that support
CML stem cells in the presence of BCR-ABL1 TKIs should open
new therapeutic options.
