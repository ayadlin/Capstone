BACKGROUND. The purposes of this study were to evaluate efficacy and toxicity
of the combination of carboplatin, gemcitabine, and capecitabine in patients
with carcinoma of unknown primary site (CUP).

METHODS. Patients with CUP received carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL a minute intra1

venously Day 1, gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 intravenously Days 1 and 8, and capecitabine 1600 mg/m2 orally in divided doses, Days 1–14 of a 21-day cycle for up
to 8 cycles. The primary endpoint of the study was objective response rate by
intent-to-treat analysis.

RESULTS. Thirty-three patients were treated (median age, 58 years; men:women
ratio, 19:14). Most patients had a baseline performance status of 1. The objective
response rate was 39.4% (95% CI, 22.9%–57.9%) in all patients, 36.4% in 22

months (95% CI, 5.4%–8.0%), and median survival time was 7.6 months (95% CI,
6.3–14.1). One and 2-year survival rates were 35.6% and 14.2%, respectively. The
most frequent grade 3 adverse events were neutropenia (67%), thrombocytopenia (48%), and anemia (33%).

CONCLUSIONS. The combination of carboplatin, gemcitabine, and capecitabine is
active in CUP, especially in patients with liver metastases. This regimen may be a
potential therapy for CUP patients with good performance status, particularly
those with a suspected origin below the diaphragm. Cancer 2007;110:770–5.

arcinoma of unknown primary site (CUP) accounted for
approximately 2% of all malignancies diagnosed in the United
States in 2006.1 Patients with CUP are a heterogeneous group, with
histologic subtypes including adenocarcinoma with various degrees
of differentiation, squamous cell carcinoma, poorly differentiated
carcinoma, and neuroendocrine cancer. Patients with CUP present
with metastatic disease, most commonly involving liver, lung, and/
or bone. The primary site is ultimately identified in only 15%–35%
of patients.2,3 Autopsy series have suggested the lung, pancreas, and
hepatobiliary tree as the most common sites of disease origin.4
There is no single regimen or approach to date that has demonstrated significant prolongation of survival in patients with CUP.
Progress has been made in identifying subgroups within this designation (eg, undifferentiated or neuroendocrine carcinomas) that
may benefit from specific therapy.5,6 However, for the relatively

common clinical scenario of a patient presenting
with well or moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma involving the liver, prognosis remains poor despite therapy.7–9
Cisplatin and its analog, carboplatin, are often
used in chemotherapy combinations to treat CUP.
Gemcitabine has demonstrated activity in pancreaticobiliary, breast, and nonsmall cell lung carcinomas,
as well as in carcinomas of unknown primary site.10,11
There is evidence of in vitro and in vivo synergy
between gemcitabine and the platinum compounds.12,13 In addition, gemcitabine enhances the
activity of 5-fluorouracil in vivo.14 Capecitabine is an
orally administered fluoropyrimidine that mimics the
efficacy, tolerance, and toxicity observed with lowdose, continuous-infusion 5-fluorouracil. Concomitant administration of gemcitabine and capecitabine
may result in increased cytotoxicity by reducing
intracellular deoxythymidine triphosphate concentrations through different mechanisms, thereby inhibiting DNA replication and repair and potentiating
the activity of carboplatin. Furthermore, this 3-drug
combination provides a convenient schedule of brief
intravenous treatment that is suitable for palliative
treatment programs in the outpatient setting. With
these considerations, we designed this study to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of carboplatin, gemcitabine, and capecitabine in patients with CUP. The
primary objective of this study was to estimate objective tumor-response rate with secondary objectives
including characterization of toxicity and assessment
of survival.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility
Eligibility criteria included cytologic or histologic
confirmation of metastatic carcinoma with the primary site not identified after a complete history and
physical examination, laboratory evaluation (serum
b-HCG [human chorionic gonadotropin], serum afetoprotein, and serum prostate-specific antigen in
men), and radiologic studies (computed tomography
of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, mammography in
women). In addition, immunohistochemical staining
of the tumor tissue, including studies for estrogen
and/or progesterone receptors and prostate-specific
antigen, were performed as clinically appropriate.
Further eligibility criteria included ages 18 years or
older, Zubrod performance status (PS) 2, and adequate organ function as defined by neutrophils
1500/mm3, platelets 100,000/mm3, serum creatinine 2.0 mg/dL, and bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL. Patients
with reproductive potential were required to use

771

effective contraception during treatment. One prior
chemotherapy regimen was allowed, provided it did
not contain carboplatin, gemcitabine, or capecitabine.
Patients with known brain metastases were ineligible. Patients with a subset of CUP appropriate for a
well-defined treatment approach (isolated squamous
cell carcinoma of the cervical lymph nodes, women
with isolated axillary lymphadenopathy or predominant peritoneal carcinomatosis, men \ 50 years of
age with poorly differentiated carcinoma in the mediastinum and/or retroperitoneum) were excluded.
In addition, patients could not have another active
systemic malignancy or any serious comorbid medical or psychiatric condition that could interfere with
the safe delivery of therapy. The institutional review
boards of the University of Michigan Medical School
(Ann Arbor, Mich) and Wayne State University
(Detroit, Mich) approved the trial. Written informed
consent was obtained from all patients before initiation of therapy.

Treatment
Treatment comprised 21-day cycles of carboplatin
(Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ), gemcitabine
(Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, Ind), and capecitabine (Roche,
Nutley, NJ). Carboplatin dose was targeted to an area
under the curve (AUC) of 5 mg/mL x minute (as per
the Calvert formula) and was given as a 30-minute
intravenous infusion after gemcitabine on Day 1.
Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 was administered as a
30-minute intravenous infusion on Days 1 and 8.
Capecitabine was taken orally twice daily for 14 days
beginning on Day 1 at a daily divided dose of 1600 mg/
m2 rounded to the nearest 500 mg. Morning and evening doses were taken 11 to 13 hours apart with the
odd tablet added to the morning dose, if necessary.
Hematopoietic growth-factor support was not given
with the first treatment cycle but was permitted with
subsequent cycles.
Dose Adjustments for Toxicity
Toxicity was evaluated according to the National
Cancer Institute’s Common Toxicity Criteria (NCICTC version 2.0). A cycle of treatment could begin
when absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was 1500/
mm3, platelets were 100,000/mm3, and nonhematologic toxicity had resolved to grade 1. Only gemcitabine and carboplatin doses were adjusted for
hematologic toxicity. On Day 8, gemcitabine was
given at full dose for ANC 1000/mm3 and platelets
75,000/mm3. For ANC 500/mm3 and \1000/mm3
or platelets [51,000/mm3 and \75,000/mm3, gemcitabine dose was reduced 50%. Gemcitabine was
dropped on Day 8 for ANC \500/mm3 or platelets

50,000/mm3. If a gemcitabine dose was dropped on
Day 8, carboplatin and gemcitabine doses were
reduced by 20% in subsequent cycles. Blood counts
were measured on Day 15 during cycles 1 and 2, and
if a patient experienced grade 4 thrombocytopenia at
any point in the cycle, subsequent doses of carboplatin and gemcitabine were reduced by 20%.
Patients who experienced capecitabine-related
toxicity grade 2 (diarrhea, stomatitis, esophagitis, or
hand-and-foot syndrome) had capecitabine held
until recovery to grade 1, and subsequent cycles
were dose-reduced by 25% for grade 2 and by 50%
for grade 3 or 4 toxicities. If agent nonspecific
grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity was observed at
any point, treatment was held until recovery to
grade 1, and all drugs were dose-reduced by 20%
for subsequent cycles. Dose re-escalation was not
permitted with the exception of Day 8 gemcitabinedose reductions.
Treatment continued for up to 8 cycles with
demonstration of objective response or disease stability. Patients were evaluated for response according
to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors
(RECIST) guidelines every 2 cycles.15 Criteria for removal from study included clinical or radiological
evidence of progressive disease, patient refusal to
continue therapy, treatment interruption [ 2 weeks,
or unacceptable toxicity.

Statistical Methods
This clinical trial used a standard Minimax 2-stage
design, whereby the response rate to treatment was
the primary endpoint.16 Response was defined as a
complete or partial overall best response within 6
months from the beginning of therapy. For design
purposes, a response rate of 40% was considered
clinically meaningful; a rate of 20% was considered
clinically insignificant. The total sample size was 33
patients to allow 80% statistical power to detect such
a difference in response.
All patients enrolled on the trial were considered
for calculation of the response to treatment following
the intent-to-treat paradigm. Response rate was
reported as a percentage, along with exact binomial
confidence intervals. Survival, progression-free survival, and time-to-treatment-failure were summarized by the Kaplan and Meier product-limit method.
For each time-dependent endpoint, the time interval
was calculated from the date of treatment initiation
until the date of death, death or disease progression,
or treatment failure, respectively. Patients who did
not reach the endpoint of interest were censored at
the date of their last clinical follow-up. Tumor-control rate was defined as stable disease or response at

3 months from treatment initiation. All statistical
analyses were conducted with SAS software (version
9.12; SAS Institute, Chicago, Ill), and P-values .05
were considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
Thirty-three patients were enrolled onto the study
between August 2001 and January 2006. Data were
collected until September 1, 2006. Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The median age at
study entry was 58 years (range, 21–73 years). No
patient had received prior chemotherapy or radiation
for CUP. Ten patients had 3 or more metastatic sites,
11 had 2 metastatic sites, and 12 patients had only 1
site of disease that included liver (n 5 5), lymph
nodes (n 5 3), and peritoneal cavity (n 5 4). The
majority (76%) of patients presented with visceral
disease. Seventy-three percent of the patients demonstrated a performance score (PS) of 0 or 1. Upon
histological review, patients were categorized into 1
of 4 groups, well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (n 5 22), poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (n 5 5), undifferentiated carcinoma (n 5 5),
and squamous cell carcinoma (n 5 1).

Toxicity
A median of 5 cycles was administered to each patient
(range, 1–8). Five (15%) patients completed \ 2 cycles
of therapy. There were 2 early deaths; 1 patient died
on Day 24, probably from a pulmonary embolus, and
another patient died on Day 23 from neutropenic
sepsis. Two patients discontinued treatment because
of clinical evidence of early disease progression after
the first cycle, and 1 patient requested removal from
the study, primarily because of toxicity.
In general, the treatment was well tolerated. Toxicity data are listed in Table 2. The most common
grade 3–4 toxicities were neutropenia (67%) and
thrombocytopenia (48%). Seven (21%) patients had
grade 4 thrombocytopenia, but none experienced
bleeding, and only 1 was transfused with platelets.
All 9 patients with a baseline PS of 2 experienced
complicated hematologic or nonhematologic toxicity
 grade 3 compared with 10 of 24 (42%) patients
with PS of 0–1. Twenty-three (70%) patients required
at least 1 dose reduction of carboplatin and/or gemcitabine, 12 because of toxicity that occurred during
cycle 1. Fourteen (42%) patients had a delay of treatment by 1 week, and 7 (21%) patients had the Day 8
dose of gemcitabine dropped once during treatment.
Capecitabine was dose-reduced for stomatitis or
diarrhea in 6 (18%) patients. Eighteen (54%) patients
required hospitalization during study treatment, 10
(30%) for treatment-related toxicity (neutropenic

the setting of disease progression, and 5 for other
nontreatment-related reasons (pulmonary embolism,3 non-neutropenic fever2).

Response and Survival
Thirteen of the 33 (39.4%; 95% CI, 22.9%–57.9%) registered patients had a partial response to treatment.
Median response duration was 3.9 months (range,
1.4–11.2 months). In the 22 patients with well to
moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, the response rate was 36.4% (95% CI, 17.2%–59.3%), and in
the 20 patients with liver metastasis, the response
rate was 40% (95% CI, 19.1%–64.0%). In the 10
patients with poorly differentiated or undifferentiated
carcinoma, the response rate was 50% (95% CI,
18.7%–81.3%). Twenty patients had a partial response
or stable disease through 4 cycles of therapy for a tumor control rate of 60.6% (95% CI, 42.1%–77.1%).
One patient with stable disease, according to RECIST
guidelines, underwent surgical resection of the residual hepatic disease, which demonstrated a pathologically complete remission.

By using intent-to-treat analysis, the median
time to treatment failure was 4.5 months (95% CI,
2.8–5.7). Median progression-free survival time was
6.2 months (95% CI, 5.4%–8.0%), and at 6 months,
over half (54.5%; 95% CI, 36.3%–69.6%) of the patients were alive and progression free. Median survival was 7.6 months (95% CI, 6.3–14.1 months), and
the 1-year and 2-year survival rates were 35.6% (95%
CI, 19.7%–51.8%) and 14.2% (95% CI, 4.6%–29.1%),
respectively. Four patients remained alive at 8.0
months, 9.4 months, 28.4 months, and 54.1 months
from treatment initiation. The Kaplan-Meier estimates for overall and progression-free survival for
the 33 enrolled patients are presented in Figure 1.

Serum Markers
Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was assessed before
treatment in 26 patients and at repeated post-therapy in 16 patients. Fourteen patients demonstrated
an elevated CEA at presentation (range, 5.6–1150.0
ng/mL), and 6 (43%) had a 50% or greater reduction
in CEA during therapy. The CA 19-9 tumor marker
was evaluated before treatment in 23 patients and
repeated in 13 patients. Fifteen patients demonstrated an elevated baseline CA 19-9 (range, 81–9829
U/mL), and 6 (40%) had a 50% or greater reduction
in CA 19-9 during therapy. Patients with a 50% in
an elevated serum marker survived longer than those
with elevated markers without response (median survival, 19.4 months vs 7.1 months; P 5 .03).

DISCUSSION
In 1996, approximately 50,000 cases of CUP were
diagnosed in the United States accounting for 5% of
all cancers.17 Currently, that number has been

reduced by more than half, mainly because of
improvements and access to radiologic examinations
and, more importantly, because pathologists are
making a specific designation as to a primary site,
which may, or may not, be consistent with the clinical presentation. Most patients with CUP, however,
continue to have a poor prognosis, and median survival is measured in months. Despite multiple clinical trials, a single regimen to extend both quality and
quantity of life has not been identified. Doublet or
triplet chemotherapy regimens (with or without a
platinum agent) are commonly used with reported
median survivals ranging from 4.5–13 months.9,10,18–21
In CUP, both liver involvement and multiple
sites of disease portend a poorer prognosis.6–8,22,23
Response rates and survival times are, therefore,
influenced by the proportion of patients with these
poor prognostic parameters in different studies. In 1
trial evaluating carboplatin and paclitaxel, 25% of
patients had liver metastases, and only 15% of these
patients had a response to treatment.17 In a trial that
evaluated a 3-drug regimen of carboplatin, paclitaxel,
and etoposide, only 9 (16%) patients had hepatic
involvement, and 2 of the 9 (22%) demonstrated a
partial response.19 By contrast, in our trial, more
than 60% of enrolled patients had hepatic involvement and 30% had 3 sites of disease at presentation. Despite these poor prognostic parameters, the
response rate in the subgroup of patients with liver

metastases was 40%. These differences in patient
characteristics between trials are likely reflective of
the heterogeneity of CUP.
Autopsy series in patients with CUP have suggested that if a primary is identified, up to 50% of
the time it is of lung, pancreatic, or hepatobiliary origin.3,24 If lung cancer is suspected clinically, carboplatin and paclitaxel with or without etoposide, may
be a reasonable treatment option.16,17,19 However, if
the primary is suspected to have originated below
the diaphragm or there is significant liver involvement, then carboplatin and paclitaxel may be less
favored, and a fluoropyrimidine or gemcitabine-based
treatment may be more effective.
The combination of gemcitabine, carboplatin,
and capecitabine was generally well tolerated despite
the occurrence of cytopenias frequently observed in
the first cycle. Greater toxicity was also noted in
patients with a baseline PS of 2. In those patients, an
initial dose reduction of 20% for all 3 agents must be
considered. It should be noted that granulocyte
growth-factor support was not routinely used in this
trial. Although myeloid growth factors would likely
ameliorate neutropenia, they may exacerbate thrombocytopenia, which was also dose limiting with this
regimen. In addition, the protocol specified full-dose
gemcitabine to be administered on Day 8 for a platelet count above 75,000, which, in combination with
carboplatin, led to subsequent platelet nadirs that
were under acceptable limits. Alternative scheduling
or dosing of carboplatin or substitution with oxaliplatin should be investigated to address the concern
of myelosuppression.
It may be noted that there is a close approximation of the progression-free survival curve to the
overall-survival curve. In patients with progressive
disease, 19 (68%) patients received subsequent
chemotherapy with little benefit, further demonstrating the limitations of present treatment options. The
majority (57%) of the 14 patients who did not receive
second-line therapy had a Zubrod performance status of 2 at study entry, which precluded additional
treatment that could have had an impact on their
overall survival.
In the near future, molecular characterization of
CUP may identify a primary origin of the cancer or
determine sensitivity and resistance profiles to guide
systemic treatment. Unfortunately, benefits of systemic therapy for advanced primary malignancies of
the lung, pancreas, and hepatobiliary system are limited, so the identification of 1 of these sites as the
site of origin of CUP is not likely to affect prognosis.
Despite this, our study seems to indicate that the 3drug regimen of carboplatin, gemcitabine, and cape-

Triplet Chemotherapy in Unknown Primary Cancer/Schneider et al.

citabine is active against CUP and should be considered a reasonable option for therapy, particularly for
those patients with hepatic involvement. Ultimately,
molecular identification and classification of these
tumors will open opportunities to treat patients with
targeted agents tailored specifically to the molecular
make-up of an individual patient’ malignancy.
