Abstract
Genomic instability in solid tumors participates in the oncogenetic process and is associated with the activation of the
DNA damage response pathway. Here, we report the activation of the constitutive DNA damage and checkpoint pathway
associated with complex karyotypes in samples from patients
with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We show that antagonizing CHK1 kinase with a small inhibitory compound or by RNA
interference strongly reduces the clonogenic properties of
high–DNA damage level AML samples, particularly those with
complex karyotypes. Moreover, we observe a beneficial effect
of CHK1 inhibition in high–DNA damage level AML samples
treated with 1-β- D -arabinofuranosylcytosine. In contrast,
CHK1 inhibition has no effect on the clonogenic properties
of normal hematopoietic progenitors. All together, our results
indicate that CHK1 inhibition may represent an attractive
therapeutic opportunity in AML with complex karyotype.

Introduction
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the most frequent acute leukemia in adults, is a clonal disorder characterized by the accumulation of malignant hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC)
with an impaired differentiation program. Despite considerable
progress in the therapy of AML and a high rate of complete
remission after induction chemotherapy, most patients relapse
and succumb to the disease (1). This clinical observation highlights the difficulties involved in eradicating the leukemic stem
cells that are responsible for the emergence of new leukemic
progenitor cells leading to relapse. AML is a heterogeneous disease and patients differ strongly in their response to therapy, in
the occurrence of relapse and in overall survival, according to
prognosis factors such as age and presence of molecular and/
or cytogenetic abnormalities. Many different genetic defects
are thought to underlie the heterogeneity of this disease (2).
On the basis of cytogenetic analysis, the classification of Grimwade and Schlenk (3, 4) defines three prognosis groups (favorable, intermediate, and high risk). Complex karyotype AML,

belonging to cytogenetic high-risk AML, is characterized by the
presence of at least three unrelated cytogenetic abnormalities
and accounts for 10% to 20% of AML cases. The percentage increases with age and this group is considered to have the worst
prognosis, despite intensive therapy (5).
Our understanding of the molecular basis of the emergence of
genomic instability in solid tumors has benefited considerably
from recent work demonstrating the involvement of a replication stress activating the DNA damage response pathway (6).
At an early stage of tumorigenesis, oncogene-induced DNA
damage, associated with replicative and oxidative stresses, is responsible for creating double-strand breaks, thus leading to activation of the DNA damage signaling pathway, with phosphorylation
of histone H2AX and ATM and activation of checkpoint kinases
(CHK1 and CHK2; refs. 7, 8). Activation of the DNA signaling
pathway in precancerous lesions has been suggested to constitute
an anticancer barrier (7). A limited number of studies have addressed the question of the presence of DNA double-strand break
in hematologic cancers. Constitutive DNA damage was observed
in two myeloid leukemia cell lines (K562 and HL60; ref. 9) and,
more recently, an increase in detectable DNA damage was reported in a mouse model of progression from myelodysplasia
to leukemia (10). However, as concern samples from AML patients, the status of the DNA damage signaling pathway has
not been documented.
The activation of the DNA damage pathway, through checkpoint kinase phosphorylation, leads to cell cycle arrest in S-phase
or at the G2-M checkpoint (11, 12). CDC25 phosphatases have
been shown to be the main effectors of active CHK1 (13), and
the abrogation of the activity of this kinase using small inhibitory
compounds or small interfering rna (siRNA) knockdown strategies has been reported to result in checkpoint bypass and in sensitization of the cells to DNA-damaging agents (14–17). For
instance, the use of 7-hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01), a CHK1 inhibitor, induces sensitization of AML progenitors to the nucleoside analogue 1-β-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C; ref. 18).
Moreover, several phase-1 and -2 trials in solid tumors have been
reported, for UCN-01, either alone (19–21) or in combination with
established cytotoxic agents (22, 23). These observations have led
to the recent development of checkpoint kinase-inhibitory compounds, some of which, including UCN-01, are currently being
evaluated in early clinical trials.
In the study reported here, we have investigated the existence
of constitutive DNA damage and activation of the DNA damage
pathway in a large panel of AML patient samples. Our results reveal high levels of DNA damage in complex karyotype AML and
show the high sensitivity of these cells to UCN-01. Together with

Checkpoint Targeting in Acute Myeloid Leukemia

the demonstration that CHK1 inhibition has no negative effect on
the growth of normal hematopoietic progenitors, our results
highlight the interest of this kinase for checkpoint targeting
therapy in hematologic malignancies.

Materials and Methods
Cells. Fresh AML samples were obtained, after informed consent, from
patients diagnosed at the Hematology Department of Toulouse University
Medical Centre (France). AML cells were isolated from bone marrow by
Ficoll-Hypaque density-gradient centrifugation and were cryopreserved in
Iscove's modified Dulbecco medium (IMDM) with DMSO (10% final concentration) and FCS (50% final concentration). All samples were kept
frozen in liquid nitrogen by the HIMIP collection of the U563 Institut
National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale department (n°DC2008-307-CPTP1 HIMIP). Frozen cells were thawed in IMDM medium
and immediately processed for clonogenic assays or cultured in IMDM,
10% FCS for 72 h for viability testing. For the DNA damaging treatment,
cells were cultured in IMDM, 10% BIT (StemCell Technologies) supplemented with SCF (100 ng/mL), IL3 (5 ng/mL), FLT3 (100 ng/mL) and
granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (10 ng/mL) for 24 h,
then treated with etoposide (VP-16; 17 μmol/L) for 30 min, released in
drug-free media, and finally analyzed for their H2AX phosphorylation profile. Normal bone marrow CD34+ HPCs were obtained after informed consent from discarded fragments from hematologically healthy patients who
had undergone hip surgery. Mononuclear cells from bone marrow were
obtained by Ficoll-Hypaque density-gradient centrifugation, after which
isolation of HPCs was performed by positive selection of CD34-expressing
cells using magnetic separation and EasySep procedure (StemCell
Technologies).
Pharmacologic inhibitors and antibodies. UCN-01 was provided by
the National Cancer Institute. Ara-C and other products used were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Antibodies were monoclonal and polyclonal anti–phospho-S139-H2AX (1:100 and 1:25, respectively; Upstate
Biotechnology and Cell Signaling), anti–phospho-S317-CHK1 (1:75; signaling), anti-CHK1 (1:75; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PE/Cy7-conjugated antiCD34 (1:100; Beckman Coulter), PE-conjugated anti-CD123 (1:50; BD) and
APC-conjugated anti-CD38 (1:10; Biolegend), and Alexa 488–conjugated
anti-rabbit and anti-mouse (1:500; Invitrogen).
Flow cytometry. Immunostaining was performed according to the previously described protocol (24). Samples were analyzed in an FC500 flow
cytometer (Beckman Coulter) and subsequently processed using the CXP
software. Four-color immunostaining was carried out according to the
previously described protocol (25). Samples were analyzed with LSRII flow
cytometer (BD), followed by data treatment using the BD FACSDiva software. All flow cytometry results are expressed as the ratio between mean
fluorescence intensity of the stained sample and that of its control isotypic antibody.
Immunofluorescence microscopy. Immunofluorescence studies were
performed as previously described (26). Cellular DNA was counterstained
with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Images were acquired using a DM6000
microscope (Leica microsystems) fitted with a Roper COOLsnap ES CCD
camera and subsequently processed using the MetaMorph and ImageJ
softwares.
Clonogenic assays. The percentage of leukemic cells present in patients' bone marrow is reported in Table 1. Clonogenic assays on AML cells
and on fresh human bone marrow CD34+ HPC cells were made according
to a method previously described (27).
siRNA experiments. AML cells were transfected using the Amaxa
nucleofection technology (Amaxa). Leukemic cells (5 × 106) were suspended in 100 μL of either kit V or human monocyte or human CD34+
cell nucleofector solution mixed with 30 pmol control and CHK1 siRNA
oligonucleotide sequences. These experiments were performed either with
single control and CHK1 siRNA (Quiagen and Dharmacon, as described in
ref. 28) or with a pool of siRNA (control and CHK1) as described (Dharmacon control and CHK1 SMART pool reagents #001820 and #003255,

www.aacrjournals.org

respectively; ref. 29). Cells were immediately nucleofected with an Amaxa
Nucleofector apparatus (program U-15 or Y-001 or U-008). They were
then transferred to culture prewarmed medium and divided into two
samples. One was used immediately for clonogenic assay and the second
was cultured in IMDM 10% FCS for 24 h to evaluate the CHK1 knockdown efficiency by Western blot.
Viability test. AML cells (1 × 105/well) were incubated in 100 μL of
IMDM 10% FCS with increasing UCN-01 concentrations for 72 h. To determine the percentage viability, 10 μL of Proliferation Reagent WST-1
(Roche) were added and the cells were incubated for 3 h. The absorbance
at 420 nm (Mithras LB 940, Berthold technologies) of samples corrected for
a background control allowed us to calculate the percentage viability of
AML samples and to determine the UCN-01 IC50.
Statistics. Results are expressed as means ± SEM. Statistical analyses
were performed by the unpaired Student's t test and Pearson correlation
test with Prism 4 software. Differences were considered as significant for
P values of ≤0.05.

Results
High levels of constitutive DNA damage in complex karyotype AML patient samples. We first examined the existence of
detectable constitutive DNA damage in samples of blasts from
AML patient, using flow cytometry to quantify H2AX phosphorylation (30). As indicated in Fig. 1A, obtained from two AML blast
cell samples (patients #20 and #44, Table 1 and Supplementary
Data 1) and one normal hematopoietic progenitor CD34-positive
cell (HPC) sample, flow cytometry histograms reveal a variable
level of phospho-H2AX labeling in malignant samples and confirm the absence of detectable labeling in the normal HPC sample. A series of 49 patient samples (see Table 1) was then
examined using the same assay and the phospho-H2AX level of
each was calculated (see Materials and Methods). As depicted on
the left side of Fig. 1B, normal HPC did not display any detectable DNA damage and their phospho-H2AX level was about 1
(mean, 1.31 ± 0.13; n = 7). In contrast, AML blasts from patient
samples expressed a higher and very variable level of phosphoH2AX (mean, 3.90 ± 0.36; n = 49; **, P = 0.007), indicating a
variable level of constitutive DNA damage. On the right side of
Fig. 1B, the phospho-H2AX level of the same patients is divided
into two groups according to their cytogenetic profiles (see Table 1).
The high-risk group (mean, 5.07 ± 0.86; n = 16, including 11
complex karyotype samples) displayed a significantly higher level
of phospho-H2AX than the intermediate one (mean, 3.08 ± 0.21;
n = 31; **, P = 0.007).
We next tested the variability of these AML samples with
respect to constitutive phospho-H2AX labeling as a physiologic
response to DNA injury and examined their capacity to induce
an additional level of phospho-H2AX after treatment with a genotoxic agent. To this end, we evaluated phospho-H2AX levels in
two AML samples, before and 1 h after treatment with the DNAdamaging agent VP-16. We observed in both samples a rapid increase of phospho-H2AX level (data not shown), reaching a peak,
1 hour after treatment (Fig. 1C), in the same range as the constitutive damage levels observed in some AML samples (Fig. 1B).
Thus, AML blasts samples with a certain level of constitutive
DNA damage retained the ability to increase this level in
response to a DNA-damaging agent.
Damage was not induced by freezing and thawing of the patient
material, as we found similar phospho-H2AX levels in three
samples of fresh and thawed AML cells and in one sample of
normal HPC (Supplementary Data 2).

Finally, we used immunofluorescence staining to look for phospho-H2AX–labeled cells in normal HPC and AML patient samples
(Fig. 1D). As shown, phospho-H2AX labeling of cells was only
detected in a fresh AML blast sample (patient #49), whereas fresh
normal CD34+ HPC were unlabeled.

All together, these results indicate that AML blast cells from
patients exhibit variable levels of constitutive DNA damage that
are in the range of the physiologic response to DNA injury; they
also show that samples from complex karyotype patients express
a relatively higher level of constitutive DNA damage.

Checkpoint Targeting in Acute Myeloid Leukemia

Checkpoint signaling pathway activation in AML patient
samples. To evaluate the consequence of constitutive DNA
damage on the downstream signaling pathway, we tested the
activation of CHK1 protein kinase. To this end, we quantified
CHK1 phosphorylation on the same AML sample cohort (Table 1).
As reported in Fig. 2A, the level of CHK1 activation, expressed as
the ratio between phosphorylated and total CHK1 levels, was
quite variable and distributed between 0.2 and 2.2. However, as
in the case of the phospho-H2AX level, we found a significantly
higher activation of CHK1 in cytogenetically based high-risk
AML (mean, 0.96 ± 0.13; n = 13, including 10 complex karyotype
samples) than in intermediate AML (mean, 0.52 ± 0.06; n = 20;
**, P = 0.002).
We next evaluated the presence of constitutive DNA damage
and activation of the damage signaling pathway in different
mature and immature hematopoietic subpopulations. As shown
in Fig. 2B, H2AX phosphorylation could be detected in all immature and mature leukemic subpopulations, independently of
the CD38 status. Analogous results were obtained for the activat-

ed form of CHK1, and for downstream targets of ATM/ATR
proteins. These results provide evidence that DNA damage appears at an early stage of leukemic hematopoietic differentiation.
Moreover, it is relevant to use phospho-H2AX detection in the
global leukemic population from AML patients, because DNA
damage is uniformly present in all leukemic subpopulations.
Our data indicate that the checkpoint signaling pathway is
constitutively activated early in complex karyotype samples.
AML blasts with high levels of DNA damage are more sensitive to CHK1 inhibition. The above results prompted us to evaluate the effect of CHK1 inhibition on AML blast samples. We
tested the sensitivity to a CHK1 inhibitor, UCN-01, first, of the
global leukemic population, using a viability test in liquid culture, then of AML progenitors, using a clonogenic assay. The
IC 50 for UCN-01 was calculated according the proliferation
dose-response curves (Supplementary Data 3) obtained for
a set of patient samples and is presented in Fig. 3A and B,
together with the phospho-H2AX level previously determined.
As shown in Fig. 3A, the sensitivity to UCN-01 was inversely

proportional to the DNA damage level. Moreover, the same differential effect was observed on AML progenitors (Fig. 3B). To
confirm that CHK1 inhibition was responsible for the inhibitory
effect observed on AML progenitors, we analyzed the effect of a
CHK1 knockdown induced by RNA interference using either a
smartpool (Fig. 3C, top) or a single siRNA (Fig. 3C, bottom; refs.
28, 29, 31). The clonogenic activity was determined in control
and CHK1 siRNA–transfected samples after 7 days (Fig. 3C,
right). CHK1 knockdown in these four AML samples (#9, #44,
#46, and #50), although producing only a modest decrease in

CHK1 level (Fig. 3C, left), resulted in an inhibition of clonogenicity. Together, these results indicate that progenitors and AML
cells predominantly with a high-DNA-damage level are more
sensitive to CHK1 inhibition.
CHK1 inhibition sensitizes AML progenitors with high–DNA
damage level to ara-C treatment. As previously noted, inhibition
of checkpoint kinases potentiates the effect of chemotherapy and
radiotherapy. In the light of our observations, we examined the

AML samples. As expected, the highest sensitization was observed in the samples of highest DNA damage level. Figure
4B reveals a strong correlation between the SF and the DNA
damage level for the 10 AML samples tested (***, P = 0.0005).
Importantly, the CHK1 knockdown performed on two patient
samples had a similar sensitizing effect and highly increased
the sensitivity to ara-C, with a considerable reduction of the
IC50 (Fig. 4C).
On the basis of these experiments, we conclude that CHK1 inhibition potentiates the effect of ara-C, as previously reported by
Sampath and colleagues (18), but, in addition, this effect is significantly greater in patient samples with a high constitutive DNA
damage level, such as those with complex karyotypes.
UCN-01 has no effect on normal granulomonocytic progenitors. To extrapolate the use of checkpoint kinase inhibitors to a
potential therapeutic strategy, it was essential to evaluate the specificity of this approach for AML cells and confirm the lack of effect

on normal progenitors. To address this issue, we examined the
effect of UCN-01 treatment on the capacity of normal HPC to generate granulomonocytic (colony-forming unit-granulocyte macrophage, CFU-GM) colonies. As shown in Fig. 5A, no significant
change in the number of colony-forming CFU-GM was observed
after ara-C treatment in combination with UCN-01 (10 nmol/L) in
five different normal HPC samples (similar results were obtained
with monocytic colonies; data not shown). The average of SF in
patient samples was significantly higher than in normal HPC samples (1.66 ± 0.14; n = 10 versus 1.05 ± 0.06; n = 5; *, P = 0.01; Fig. 5B).
Moreover, we observed that normal HPC were relatively insensitive
to the CHK1 inhibitor UCN-01 in clonogenic assay (Fig. 5C). The
average of IC50 for UCN-01 in AML samples was highly significantly lower than in the value obtained with normal HPC [77.9 ± 16.7
(n = 7) versus 378.3 ± 40.2 (n = 5); ***, P < 0.0001; Fig. 5D]. Proliferation dose-response curves are reported as Supplementary Data
(Supplementary Data 5).

Discussion
This study shows for the first time that cells from patients with
AML exhibit a high spontaneous level of constitutive DNA damage,
concomitant with DNA damage checkpoint pathway activation.
This activation occurs early in hematopoietic differentiation, as
it is detected in immature leukemic blast cells with a CD34+
CD38− CD123+ phenotype, which are enriched in severe combined
immunodeficient leukemia–initiating cells (32). Furthermore, activation of the checkpoint pathway is closely associated with complex karyotype samples belonging to the high-risk cytogenetic
group. This finding could have major pharmacologic consequences, because it opens a therapeutic window for new compounds targeting the checkpoint machinery. Indeed, in our work,
we show that samples from complex karyotype AML patients who
are classically resistant to conventional chemotherapy (33) respond to the combined use of ara-C with a CHK1 kinase inhibitor;
in contrast, growth of normal hematopoietic progenitors is not impaired by such treatment.
Bartkova and colleagues (7) have proposed a model in which the
activation of checkpoint signaling pathways in response to DNA
damage first constitutes a barrier to the transformation process,
preceding p53 mutations, and subsequently becomes a hallmark
of the genetic instability of the tumor. It is not clear whether a
similar process occurs in hematologic malignancies. Evidence for
an increasing activation of the nonhomologous end-joining DNA
repair machinery due to the presence of constitutive DNA damage
in two AML leukemia cell lines was previously reported (9). In this
latter study, the authors highlighted the possible role of the repair
machinery in increasing genomic instability. More recently, a study
performed in a mouse model of progression from myelodysplasia

www.aacrjournals.org

to leukemia showed that tumor progression is associated with an
increase of spontaneous DNA damage involving reactive oxygen
species (34).
Our results show that AML patient samples are also characterized by constitutive DNA damage and activation of the DNA damage checkpoint signaling pathway. Moreover, similarly to solid
tumors, complex karyotype samples, which display major genomic
instability, show the highest level of constitutive DNA damage and
checkpoint activation. Indeed, we have shown that, for AML patient samples with complex karyotype, the level of DNA damage
detected by phospho-H2AX is higher than in samples with normal
karyotype. We also report that complex karyotype samples exhibit
a significantly higher level of activated CHK1 kinase than those
with normal karyotypes.
This CHK1 activation is consistent with a scenario in which various activated oncogenes, such as NRAS or KRAS, or multiple chromosomal rearrangements, result in loss, gain, or amplification of
chromosomal material frequently observed in complex karyotype
AML (2). All these events contribute to the establishment of genomic instability. The origin of the higher genomic instability in
complex karyotype patients has not been fully elucidated. Schoch
and colleagues (35, 36) have shown a specific transcriptional pattern with an upregulation of DNA repair and checkpoint signaling
genes. Moreover, 78% of complex karyotype samples present p53
alterations, compared with 14% in other cytogenetic subtypes
(37). Haferlach and colleagues' study (37) correlated the presence
of genetic abnormalities on chromosome 17 affecting the p53 pathway with a greater resistance to all conventional drugs used in chemotherapy, highlighting the p53 role in cell cycle checkpoint
response. However, although p53 is mutated in complex karyotype
AML cells, it is difficult to know if p53 mutation contributes to the
great genomic instability observed in complex karyotype AML cells
or if p53 mutation is a consequence of the preexisting genomic instability of complex karyotype AML cells. Additional studies specifically dedicated to the investigation of cell cycle checkpoint

response and AML p53 mutation will be necessary to evaluate
precisely its impact.
In Bartkova's model, activated oncogenes, associated with replicative and oxidative stresses, are responsible for DNA injury, leading to the activation of the DNA damage signaling pathway (7).
Considering the high genetic instability of complex karyotype samples, it is more than likely that similar mechanisms operate in
AML. Among various mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapy,
it has been shown that complex karyotype AML displays a combined activity both of multidrug resistance proteins P-gp and
MDR-related protein 1, which contributes to the chemoresistance
(38). In this study, we confirm that complex karyotype AML
samples display the highest resistance to chemotherapy, even that
involving the widely used antimetabolite, ara-C, which is not a
P-gp substrate. Moreover, this poor sensitivity is also likely to be
correlated with their lower proliferative activity in comparison
with the favorable and intermediate prognosis group (39). The
weak proliferative activity explains the low incorporation of
ara-C into DNA and, consequently, contributes to the poor effect
of this treatment, which precludes complete clinical remission. In
view of the global resistance mechanisms to chemotherapy used by
complex karyotype cells, the use of checkpoint inhibitors may
represent an attractive pharmacologic strategy to increase the
efficacy of ara-C treatment in the group of complex karyotype
AML patients. Our findings strongly support this idea. First,
we show that complex karyotype samples are particularly sensitive
to CHK1 inhibition by UCN-01 and by RNA interference. More
importantly, we have shown that low concentrations of UCN-01
induce a sensitization to ara-C treatment that is particularly
marked in the high–DNA damage sample. Similar results were
obtained when UCN-01 and VP-16 were used together (data not

shown). Moreover, Sampath and colleagues (18) have shown that
UCN-01, in combination with ara-C, induces a rapid decrease of
the constitutive activation CHK1 in 8 AML samples.
Above all, we have clearly shown that the same concentration
UCN-01 has no effect on the growth and clonogenic capacity of
normal HPCs, thus indicating that such an association between
a checkpoint targeting agent and an antimetabolite has a specific
effect on abnormal hematopoiesis.
Finally, our study shows that evaluation of the DNA damage
level by flow cytometry detection of histone H2AX phosphorylation
is a very easy and direct assay to routinely select the patients for
whom such a combinative treatment may be beneficial. The use of
this simple technology could be of real interest to identify AML
patients with complex karyotype AML and high DNA damage
and to constitute the large cohort of such patients that are now
required to evaluate in detail the therapeutic potential of checkpoint inhibitors.
