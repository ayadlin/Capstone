Oncogenic mutations in PIK3CA, which encodes the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) catalytic subunit p110a, occur in B25%
of human breast cancers. In this study, we report the development of a knock-in mouse model for breast cancer where the
endogenous Pik3ca allele was modiﬁed to allow tissue-speciﬁc conditional expression of a frequently found Pik3caH1047R
(Pik3cae20H1047R) mutant allele. We found that activation of the latent Pik3caH1047R allele resulted in breast tumors with multiple
histological types. Whole-exome analysis of the Pik3caH1047R-driven mammary tumors identiﬁed multiple mutations, including
Trp53 mutations that appeared spontaneously during the development of adenocarinoma and spindle cell tumors. Further, we
used this model to test the efﬁcacy of GDC-0941, a PI3K inhibitor, in clinical development, and showed that the tumors
respond to PI3K inhibition.

INTRODUCTION
The class-IA phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) catalytic subunits,
p110a, p110b and p110d, occur as an obligate heterodimer in
complex with p85a-, p55a-, p50a-, p85b- or p55g-regulatory
subunits.1 - 3 In normal cells, PI3Ks are maintained in a basal
inactive state and become active following growth factor
stimulation and cell-surface-receptor engagement. Activated PI3Ks
phosphorylate and convert phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
(PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Elevated
cellular PIP3 levels promote the activation of PI3K effectors, which
in turn regulate a number of cellular processes, including cell
growth, proliferation and survival.1 - 3
Frequent somatic mutations in PIK3CA, the gene that encodes
p110a, have been reported in colorectal, breast and liver
cancers.4 - 6 The majority of the reported p110a mutations occur
in three hotspots---two (E542K and E545K) in the helical domain
and one (H1047R) in the kinase domain.7,8 These hotspot
mutations result in an oncogenic p110a capable of constitutively
activating downstream signaling.8 Further, the p110a mutants
when expressed in cells can lead to cellular transformation and
support tumor formation in xenograft models.4,9 - 12
Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of human
cancer serve as an important resource for understanding tumor
initiation and progression.13 GEMMs have also been used to test
therapeutics and develop treatment strategies.14 Studies aimed
at understanding oncogenic transformation by mutant Pik3ca
have primarily used cell-based systems, xenograft models
and conditional transgenic models.4,10 - 12,15 - 18 Given the high
frequency of PIK3CA mutations and ongoing efforts to develop

small-molecule inhibitors, a knock-in mouse model that can
express endogenous levels of mutant Pik3ca from its native
promoter and genomic architecture would be a valuable tool to
study tumor initiation, progression and treatment. Also, such a
model would lend itself to identiﬁcation of lesions that cooperate
with mutant Pik3ca during tumor development. With this in mind,
we generated a GEMM where we have modiﬁed the endogenous
Pik3ca allele by placing a dormant copy of an oncogenic mutant
Pik3ca exon 20, encoding H1047R, adjacent to the wild-type
coding exon 20. Prior to activation of the dormant mutant allele,
the engineered mice expressed the modiﬁed wild-type Pik3ca
(Pik3cae20mwt) allele. However, upon Cre-mediated recombination,
the mutant Pik3cae20H1047R allele was conditionally activated in the
mouse mammary glands, leading to its expression and tumorigenesis.
Although next-generation sequencing has enabled basepairlevel characterization of human tumors as they evolve and
progress,19,20 mouse models of cancer provide a deﬁned
experimentally tractable system that allows systematic sampling
and characterization of tumors as they evolve. In an effort to
characterize the tumors at the sequence level, we performed
whole-exome capture and sequencing of tumors, and identiﬁed
the emergence of spontaneous Trp53 mutations as a potential
cooperating event in spindle cell tumor and adenocarcinoma
formation. We further report additional somatic mutations and
copy-number aberrations in breast tumors from this model. In
addition to molecular characterization, we tested the ability of a
PI3K small-molecule inhibitor for efﬁcacy and show that the
tumors respond to inhibitor treatment.

RESULTS
Engineering conditionally activatable Pik3caH1047R mice
To study the role of Pik3ca mutations in tumor initiation,
development and progression, we have engineered a mouse
capable of conditionally expressing the mutant Pik3ca H1047R
allele driven by its native promoter. The engineered mouse,
Pik3cae20mwt, has a wild-type Pik3ca exon 20 that was modiﬁed to
contain ﬂanking loxP sites. The modiﬁed wild-type exon is
followed by a transcriptional stop cassette and a copy of Pik3ca
exon 20 encoding an H1047R mutation (Figures 1a -- d). A targeting
vector (Figure 1b) was used to modify the endogenous Pik3ca
locus in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Two independent
ES cell clones containing the appropriate modiﬁcation, identiﬁed
by Southern blotting (Figures 1f and g), were used to generate
chimeric mice that showed germline transmission of the
Pik3cae20mwt allele. Intercrosses involving heterozygous
Pik3cae20mwt/ þ mice resulted in progenies with the appropriate
genotypes at expected Mendelian ratios (Supplementary
Table 1). Unlike the embryonic lethality observed in Pik3ca/null mice,21 prior to Cre-mediated recombination, we found that
the homozygous Pik3cae20mwt/e20mwt animals were born at the
expected Mendelian frequency (Supplementary Table 1), indicating that the modiﬁed Pik3cae20mwt functioned analogous to the
wild-type Pik3ca allele.
Mammary gland-speciﬁc expression of Pik3cae20H1047R allele
As PIK3CA is mutated in over 25% of human breast cancers9 we
tested the role of Pik3caH1047R in breast tumorigenesis by breeding
the Pik3cae20mwt mouse to an MMTV-Cre transgenic mouse.22,23
The MMTV-Cre strain expresses P1 Cre recombinase under the
control of a mammary gland-permissive MMTV-LTR promoter,
allowing recombination and expression of Pik3cae20H1047R. We
conﬁrmed the expression of the Pik3cae20H1047R mutant allele and
the wild-type Pik3ca allele by sequencing the cDNA corresponding
to the Pik3ca mRNA extracted from the mammary glands of the
Pik3cae20H1047R/ þ mouse (Figure 1h). In contrast, RNA extracted
from kidney showed the expression of only wild-type Pik3ca from

the Pik3cae20mwt allele (Figure 1i), conﬁrming mammary-speciﬁc
expression of the mutant Pik3cae20H1047R allele.
Expression of Pik3cae20H1047R leads to enhanced mammary branch
morphogenesis
Previous studies have shown that expression of oncogenes or
loss of tumor suppressors, such as Pten, affects branching
and morphogenesis of mouse mammary glands.17,24,25
Hence, we studied the effect of expression of Pik3cae20H1047R on
mammary gland development using whole-mount staining. At
12 weeks, Pik3cae20H1047R/ þ mutant mammary glands showed
precocious lobulo-alveolar development and hyper-branched
ductal structures compared to control mammary glands
(Supplementary Figures 1a -- d). We found that there was a
B2-fold increase in ductal branch points in mutant animals
(n ¼ 6) as compared with the control group (MMTV-Cre (n ¼ 3),
P ¼ 0.003; Pik3cae20mwt/ þ (n ¼ 4), P ¼ 0.001; Supplementary Figure
1e). By 50 weeks, the Pik3cae20H1047R/ þ mutant mammary glands
showed a feathery, hyper-branched morphology compared with
the control mammary glands (Supplementary Figures 1f and g).
Further, histological sections of the Pik3cae20H1047R/ þ mutant
mammary glands showed evidence of tumor nodules at 50 weeks
of age (Supplementary Figures 1h and i). This is similar
to the mammary branching morphogenesis defects reported in
previous studies involving Pten conditional null mice and
other mammary-speciﬁc transgenic models with PI3K pathway
activation.17,24
Pik3cae20H1047R expression promotes mammary tumorigenesis
Female Pik3cae20H1047R/ þ , Pik3cae20mwt/ þ and MMTV-Cre mice
were aged to see if they develop mammary tumors. We found that
the Pik3cae20H1047R/ þ animals developed mammary gland tumors
(Figures 2a -- c), with a median tumor-free survival of 478.5 days.
The majority of the animals developed tumors in the thoracic
mammary glands (#1, 2, 3, 6 7 and 8), whereas some developed
tumors in the inguino-abdominal mammary glands (#4, 5,
9 and 10), and a few developed tumors in both thoracic

and inguino-abdominal mammary glands. In contrast to
Pik3cae20H1047R/ þ , the control Pik3cae20mwt/ þ and MMTV-Cre
animals remained tumor-free for the duration of the study. The
mammary gland tumor phenotype with a similar latency was also
observed in Pik3cae20H1047R/ þ mice derived from a second
independent targeted ES clone (line 2; Figure 2c), further
conﬁrming the speciﬁcity of the Pik3cae20H1047R expression-driven
tumor phenotype.
MMTV-LTR promoter drives gene expression in both virgin and
lactating mammary glands.22 Given this, we compared tumor
incidence in nulliparous and multiparous mice, and found that
latency was signiﬁcantly shortened from 492 to 465 days
(P ¼ 0.0002) in multiparous Pik3cae20H1047R/ þ mice as compared
with nulliparous Pik3cae20H1047R/ þ animals (Supplementary Figure 2),
suggesting that pregnancy-related mammary gland changes
potentially contribute to accelerated tumorigenesis. Alternatively,
during pregnancy, an increase in progenitor cells undergoing
Cre-mediated Pik3ca activation may contribute to the accelerated
tumorigenesis observed.26
Although the MMTV-LTR promoter directs Cre expression
starting at day 6 after birth in mammary epithelial cells primarily,
it is also known to drive expression in salivary glands and
male seminal vesicles.23 In performing histological analysis of
salivary glands from mice bearing mammary tumors and
seminal vesicles from males aged between 35 and 41 weeks, we
found no evidence of tumors (Supplementary Figures 3a and b).
However, morphologically the seminal vesicles were larger in
Pik3cae20H1047R/ þ mice as compared with the control animals.
Histological analysis of seminal vesicle cross-sections indicated an
Oncogene (2013) 318 - 326

increase in seminal vesicle ﬂuid secretion leading to ductal
distention and enlargement (Supplementary Figures 3c and d).
However, this did not affect the breeding and fertility of
Pik3cae20H1047R/ þ males.
Histology and signaling activation in Pik3cae20H1047R-driven tumors
We performed histological analysis of Pik3cae20H1047R/ þ tumors to
understand its pathological features and found that the majority
of the tumors showed features consistent with ﬁbroadenoma
(76.9% (20/26)) (Figure 2d), whereas a few showed histopathological features of adenocarcinoma (15.4% (4/26)) (Figures 2e and f)
or spindle cell neoplasia (7.7% (2/26)) (Figure 2g).
To further characterize tumors, we tested the PI3K pathway
activation status of the histologically distinct tumor types. In all
tumors types, we observed elevated pAKT and pS6-kinase
(Figure 2h), both downstream from PI3K, indicative of constitutive
activation of the pathway in these tumors.
In an effort to further understand the mammary tumor types
observed, we studied the expression of basal cytokeratin 5 (CK5),
luminal cytokeratin 18 (CK18), estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and a mesenchymal marker, vimentin, in
them (Figure 3). While we found ﬁbroadenomas and adenocarcinomas to be CK5 þ , CK18 þ , ER þ and PR þ , the spindle cell tumors
were ER/PR (Figure 3o) and CK5 (data not shown). Interestingly, this is reminiscent of the ER and PR status reported for
human mammary spindle cell tumors.27,28 In addition, the spindle
cell tumors were CK18 þ /vimentin þ (Figures 3n and p), indicating
that the cells are undergoing epithelial -- mesenchymal transition
(EMT).

anti-PR (o), anti-PR (d, h, l), and anti-CK18 and anti-vimentin (n, p) antibodies. The section in panel p was obtained from a third-passage
spindle cell tumor explant.

Genomic analysis of Pik3cae20H1047R-driven mammary tumors
Prior to performing genomic analysis of Pik3caH1047R mammary
tumors, given the long latency for tumor formation, we ﬁrst
tested whether tumor explants derived from mammary tumors
would grow as xenografts in SCID mice. The majority of
ﬁbroadenomas, adenocarcinomas and spindle cell tumors that
we tested formed tumors. Interestingly, the histology of some
xenograft tumors derived from ﬁbroadenoma explants showed
features of adenocarcinoma, indicating that ﬁbroadenomas are
likely benign and that only a subset of cells with tumorigenic
potential within the original explants contributed to the development of tumors upon passage (Supplementary Figures 4a and b).
However, the spindle cell tumor explants maintained their
histological features during passage (Supplementary Figures 4c
and d).
We performed microarray-based gene expression analyses of
different mammary tumor subtypes and control mammary glands
to further understand their molecular characteristics. Hierarchical
clustering of expression data using markers for epithelial cells,
stem cells and EMT29,30 showed that primary ﬁbroadenomas,
adenocarcinomas and tumors derived from passaging the
explants from these tumor types clustered together, indicating a
common origin and a shared set of gene expression changes
(Figure 4a). In contrast to the spindle cell type, both primary and
passaged tumors, clustered together showing features of EMT,
& 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited

suggests a distinct cellular origin or is reﬂective of a distinct set of
cooperating mutations in this tumor type (Figure 4a).
Whole-exome capture and sequencing have been applied in
identifying somatic mutations in the coding regions of genomes.31
In order to understand the emergence of secondary mutations in
the various mammary tumor types observed in our model, we
performed whole-exome capture and sequencing of a select set
of samples (Supplementary Table 2). Besides the presence of the
engineered Pik3ca H1047R mutation, the tumors also contained
several additional somatic changes (Supplementary Table 3 and
Supplementary Figure 5). We found that the ﬁbroadenomas had a
low level of somatic mutations (between 2 and 13), followed by
adenocarcinomas (between 4 and 61 mutations) and spindle cell
tumors (between 44 and 88 mutations). Notably, we found the
Trp53 I192N mutation in an adenocarcinoma and an R245H
mutation in a spindle cell tumor. The R245H mutation is
equivalent of R248H TP53 hotspot mutation found in human
cancers.32 Additionally, to understand the prevalence of the Trp53
mutation in the oncogenic Pik3ca-driven mouse tumors, we
sequenced the coding exons of Trp53 in an independent spindle
cell tumor and identiﬁed an A135V mutation (Figure 4b, and
Supplementary Tables 3 and 5). All Trp53 mutations identiﬁed in
this study occur in the DNA-binding domain and are known to
impair Trp53 function and have been reported in human
cancers.32 - 34 Further, the Trp53 mutation and the majority of

tumor 16. Similarly, tumor sample 19 was derived from passaging tumor 11. Samples 5, 7 and 8 were mammary glands from control groups.

the mutations identiﬁed in the primary spindle cell tumor were
also found in the explant-derived tumors following passage,
indicating that the primary spindle tumor was likely genetically less
heterogeneous (Supplementary Figure 5). As observed in the
spindle cell tumors, the majority of the mutations present in the
primary adenocarcinoma were also present in the tumors derived
following transplantation and passaging (Supplementary Figure 5).
Analysis of the effect of protein-altering somatic changes using
SIFT35 and/or PolyPhen36 identiﬁed 39 mutations, including
those in Plk1, Tssk2 and Smg1 kinases, to have a functional
effect suggesting that some of these may act as drivers
(Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Figure 5). Interestingly, SMG1 mutations have been reported previously in human
breast cancer.37
In addition to whole-exome mutational analysis, we proﬁled
the tumors on CGH arrays to understand chromosomal copynumber alteration. We found that both ﬁbroadenomas and
adenocarcinomas showed few regions of copy-number aberrations (Supplementary Table 4). In contrast to ﬁbroadenomas and
adenocarcinomas, we found several regions with copy-number
alterations in spindle cell tumor samples when compared with
normal mammary glands (Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary Figures 6s and 7a). Spindle cell tumors are also
characterized by two regions of chromosomal loss that fall within
Oncogene (2013) 318 - 326

chromosomes 11 and 12, both of which contain several coding
genes. In particular, deletion in chromosome 11 resulted in loss
of Nf1 (Supplementary Figure 7) and is consistent with its
downregulated expression (log2 ratio of 2.09; P ¼ 8.338e05;
Figure 4a), suggesting that the Ras -- MAPK pathway might also be
engaged in these tumors.
Pik3cae20H1047R/ þ mammary tumors respond to PI3K inhibitor
Engineered mouse models provide an ideal platform for candidate
drug testing in a preclinical setting.14 As the mice in this study
develop mammary tumors after a long latency, we used our
explant-derived tumor model to test its utility in assessing drug
efﬁcacy. Explants derived from spindle cell tumors with Trp53
mutation were implanted subcutaneously near the mammary fat
pad and treated with a PI3K inhibitor, GDC-0941,38,39 once the
tumors had reached a volume of 200 -- 300 mm3. Tumor-bearing
mice were treated in four groups of nine animals each with 50,
100 and 150 mg/kg GDC-0941 or a vehicle. We found that animals
treated with GDC-0941 showed the highest tumor growth
inhibition (TGI) of 85% at 150 mg/kg, although TGI was also
observed at the other tested doses compared with vehicle
treatment (Figure 5a), indicating that these tumors were still
dependent on the mutant Pik3ca signaling for their growth.

Further, log-rank tests of these data regarding time to progression
showed that all the drug treatment groups showed a statistically
signiﬁcant difference when compared with the vehicle-treated
animals at all the doses tested (Po0.0001 at 150 mg/kg;
Supplementary Figure 8). Consistent with the TGI observed,
tumors from mice treated with GDC-0941 showed a signiﬁcant
decrease in pAKT and pS6 at least up to 10 h following treatment
(Figure 5b), conﬁrming the contribution of PI3K inhibition in tumor
growth inhibition.
DISCUSSION
GEMMs of cancer are invaluable for understanding tumor
initiation, progression and therapy evaluation.40 In addition,
application of next-generation sequencing technologies to these
models can provide valuable information on the molecular
aberrations that arise during the evolution of tumors. Here we
describe a conditionally activatable Pik3caH1047R mouse model of
breast cancer and show that these mice develop mammary
tumors of multiple histological types, including ﬁbroadenomas,
adenocarcinomas and spindle cell neoplasia. We found that the
ﬁbroadenomas and adenocarcinomas were positive for hormone
receptors and cytokeratins (CK5 þ /CK18 þ ), indicating they are
epithelial and myoepithelial in origin. By contrast, the spindle cell
tumors, whereas being positive for cytokeratin 18, were distinct in
that they were ER/PR-negative but vimentin-positive. This is
reminiscent of human mammary spindle cell tumors.27,28
PIK3CA mutations are observed in multiple human breast cancer
subtypes, including of hormone receptor-positive (HR þ ), Her2 þ
triple-negative (TN) and metaplastic types.41 This is consistent with
the multiple histological types observed in our breast cancer
model and other published transgenic Pik3caH1047R breast tumor
models.16 - 18 However, the latency of breast tumor development
in our model is longer compared with these studies where the
Pik3caH1047R mutant cDNA was expressed under the control of
either an ROSA26 locus promoter (median survival B140 days in
line A; 4500 days in line NLST)16 or a chicken b-actin promoter
(average latency 214±22.6 days)17,24,25 following activation of its
expression using MMTV-Cre or induction of expression from a
tetracycline-inducible promoter (average latency 210 days).16 - 18
This likely reﬂects the fact that our knock-in model expresses the
mutant Pik3ca allele from its endogenous promoter present in its
native genomic conﬁguration and hence more closely mimics the
PIK3CAH1047R-driven tumorigenesis observed in human tumors.
The advent of next-generation sequencing technology has
allowed comprehensive characterization of cancers at the
sequence level.42 In applying next-generation sequencing technology, we have characterized tumors derived from our mouse
& 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited

model to understand additional hits required for breast tumor
development following expression of the Pik3caH1047R mutant
allele. Among several candidate secondary hits that may
cooperate with Pik3caH1047R, we report the occurrence of Trp53
mutations in two spindle cell tumors and one adenocarcinoma
sample. All three Trp53 mutations, R245H, A135V and I192N
(equivalent to human TP53 mutations R248H, A138V and I195N),
observed in this study occur in human cancers.32 - 34 TP53 and
PIK3CA mutations co-occur in human breast cancer.43 Recently,
loss of Trp53 has been shown to accelerate tumorigenesis in an
oncogenic Pik3ca transgenic mouse breast tumor model.16 The
spontaneous emergence of Trp53 mutations in our tumor model
mimics the cooperative TP53 lesions observed in human breast
cancer. Hence, our mouse model will be ideal to study therapeutic
intervention strategies for Pik3ca-driven mammary tumors. In line
with this, we demonstrate the utility of our model in testing the
efﬁcacy of GDC-0941, a PI3K inhibitor, in a subset of mammary
tumor with EMT features. A previous report studied the efﬁcacy of
NVP-BEZ235, a dual pan-PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, in a Pik3caH1047R
transgenic lung tumor model.15 However, given that PIK3CA
mutations are more frequent in human breast cancers, our model
can serve as a genetically deﬁned system to test the efﬁcacy of
PI3K inhibitors in breast cancer and potentially help to develop
treatment regimens for clinical drug testing. Also, the model can
be used to understand the development of resistance to targeted
therapeutics. In this context, it remains to be seen whether the
c-Myc-mediated mechanism of resistance, recently reported in a
transgenic oncogenic Pik3ca mammary tumor model, has a role in
our model system.16 - 18
Besides its utility in studying mammary tumorigenesis, this
model can be used to study other cancers where PIK3CA mutations
have been observed, by activating the mutant Pik3ca allele using
an appropriate tissue-speciﬁc Cre line. In conjunction with nextgeneration sequencing technologies, our model can be used to
discover and understand additional driver mutations that cooperate with mutant Pik3ca in other tumor types. Given that PI3K
pathway activation has been implicated in resistance to therapy,44
the Pik3caH1047R mice can also be used to model drug resistance
and study therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Generation of conditionally activatable Pik3caH1047R mice
We used a targeting vector template (Supplementary Figure 9) to assemble
the ﬁnal targeting vector. Using mouse genomic DNA from C57B/6N ES
cells as template, a 2.045-kb fragment encompassing Pik3ca exons 18
and 19 (left arm), a 588-bp region containing Pik3ca wild-type exon 20
(mid-arm), and a 3.137-kb genomic DNA containing exon 20 and an

additional 30 intronic sequence (right arm) were PCR-ampliﬁed and used
for constructing the vector. Prior to cloning into the template targeting
vector, codon 1047 encoded by exon 20 in the left arm was mutated to
code for histidine (R1047H) using standard mutagenesis techniques. In
cloning the mid-arm into the targeting template vector, the wild-type exon
20 region was modiﬁed by addition of a human growth hormone (hgh)
polyA signal present in the vector. A neomycin (neo) expression cassette
and a 4  transcriptional stop cassette45 were part of the vector used to
assemble the targeting construct. In the ﬁnal conﬁguration, the neomycin
cassette was ﬂanked by ‘frt’ sites to facilitate its excision following
modiﬁcation of the ES cells. Also, the modiﬁed wild-type exon was ﬂanked
by ‘loxP’ sites to facilitate its removal, upon which the mutant exon 20 can
be activated (Figure 1). Accuracy of the targeting vector was veriﬁed by
Sanger sequencing. The targeting construct was electroporated into C57B/
6N ES cells and selected for neomycin resistance. Appropriately targeted
ES clones were identiﬁed by 50 and 30 Southern blotting. The 50 probe
recognized a 6.6-kb wild-type fragment and a 9.1-kb fragment in the
targeted ES cell (Figures 1c and f). Similarly, the 30 probe recognized a
6.9-kb wild-type fragment and a 4.8-kb fragment in the ES cells where the
Pik3ca allele was modiﬁed (Figures 1c and g). Following removal of the neo
cassette and conﬁrmation of the architecture of the modiﬁed genomic
region encoding Pik3ca by PCR and sequencing, the ES clones were
injected into blastocysts to generate chimeric mice. A 290-bp PCR product,
as opposed to a 201-bp fragment in wild-type mice, generated using
primers 20F (AGCCAGCAGACAATAATTCTTAGCACA) and 20R (CAGTGCTT
GAACATTGGAGGTCAGT) was used to follow germline transmission and
also genotype-modiﬁed, Pik3ca allele-bearing mice. To activate the latent
Pik3caH1047R mutant allele in mammary glands, we bred this mouse with an
MMTV-Cre line (Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, ME, USA; # 003551; line A). Mice
that showed any body condition scoreo2,46 a hunched posture and
4 20% loss of body weight were killed as per the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines. Our endpoint study included
mice with tumors that reached B2500 mm3 and also those with palpable
tumors that were killed in accordance with IACUC recommendations. All
mice were maintained in our animal facility as per the IACUC guidelines.

Histological, immunohistochemical and whole-mount analysis
Five-micrometer, formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded specimens was used
for routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and histology evaluation.
For whole-mount analysis, the mammary glands were dissected, spread
and ﬁxed with Carnoy’s ﬁxative for 2 -- 4 h. Tissues were hydrated and
stained in Carmine alum overnight.
Immunoﬂuorescence staining was performed using 10-mm sections
Tissue-Tek OCT (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA, USA)-embedded frozen
samples. The sectioned samples were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for
10 min and then blocked for 30 min with PBT (PBS with 0.1% Triton)
containing 1% bovine serum albumin. The blocked sections were then
stained with an appropriate primary antibody diluted in PBT with 0.1%
bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 1C in a humidiﬁed chamber. The
slides were washed three times in PBT and then incubated with
appropriate secondary antibodies for 60 min at room temperature in a
humidiﬁed chamber. Unbound secondary antibody was removed by
washing with PBT. The Prolong Gold anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes,
Eugene, OR, USA) was used to mount the slides. Primary antibodies against
cytokeratin 5 (ab53121), cytokeratin 18 (ab668), PR (ab2764) and vimentin
(ab45939) were obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA). The ERa (Ab21) was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc (Waltham, MA, USA).
Appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa 488 or 647
(Molecular Probes) were used for detecting the bound primary antibody.

Western blot analysis
Frozen tumors were weighed and lysed with a pestle PP (Scienceware,
Pequannock, NJ, USA) in cell extraction buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science,
Indianapolis, IN, USA) 1 mM phenylmethysulfonyl ﬂuoride, and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails 1 and 2 (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). Protein
concentrations were determined using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit
Oncogene (2013) 318 - 326

(Rockford, IL, USA). For western blots, equal amounts of protein were
separated by electrophoresis using NuPage Bis - Tris 4 - 12% gradient gels
(Invitrogen) and then transferred onto nitrocellulose pore membranes
using the iBlot system (Invitrogen). The primary antibodies, pAkt (Ser473),
pAkt (Thr308), total Akt, pS6 (Ser235/236), pS6 (Ser240/242) and total S6,
were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). Antiactin antibody was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Chemiluminescence
western blotting detection (Amersham Biosciences, Pittsburgh, PA, USA)
coupled with appropriate secondary, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary IgG antibodies was used to detect the primary, antibody-bound
proteins.

DNA/RNA preparation
DNA from tumors and normal tissues was prepared using the QiagenAllPrep DNA/RNA kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). RNA samples were prepared
using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen).

Expression analysis
The quantity and quality of total RNA samples were determined,
respectively, using an ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientiﬁc,
Wilmington, DE, USA) and Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA, USA). A Cy dye-labeled cRNA preparation and array hybridization
were prepared as per the manufacturer’s (Agilent Technologies) instructions. Brieﬂy, total RNA sample was converted to double-stranded cDNA
and then to Cy dye-labeled cRNA using an Agilent Quick Amp Labeling kit.
The labeled cRNA was puriﬁed using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). cRNA
yield and Cy dye incorporation were determined using the ND-1000
spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientiﬁc). A 750-ng weight of the labeled
cRNA was fragmented and hybridized to Agilent Whole Mouse Genome
4  44 K arrays. All samples were labeled with Cy5 dye and hybridized
against a Cy3 dye-labeled universal mouse reference (Stratagene, La Jolla,
CA, USA). Samples were hybridized for 17 h at 65 1C with constant agitation
on a Pro Hybridization station HS 4800 (Tecan US, Durham, NC, USA).
Following hybridization, the arrays were washed, dried and scanned using
an Agilent scanner. The Agilent Feature Extraction software 10.7 was used
to analyze the acquired array images. The data were processed using
methods implemented in the limma R package.47 First, data were
background-corrected, after which a within-array loess ﬁt normalization
and a between-array quintile normalization were applied.48 Differentially
expressed gene signatures were obtained using limma’s linear model ﬁt
and probes with a false discovery rate-adjusted P-value of 0.05 or lower,
and a log2 fold change of at least 2, were deemed differentially expressed.
Hierarchical clustering of samples and EMT-related genes was computed
on the mean centered gene expression proﬁles using the Euclidian
distance metric and complete linkage clustering.

CGH arrays
Mammary tumor samples from Pik3cae20H1047R/ þ mice were proﬁled on
Agilent CGH arrays according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Agilent
Technologies). Brieﬂy, 500 ng DNA of both tumor and a reference sample
(C57BL/6J mouse; The Jackson Laboratory, ME, USA) were digested with
AluI and RsaI (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and subsequently puriﬁed using
the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen). Digested samples were labeled
with Cy5-dUTP (test sample) or Cy3-UTP (reference sample) using the
Genomic DNA Labeling Kit Plus (Agilent Technologies). Test samples were
pooled with the reference and subsequently puriﬁed using MicroCon
YM-30 (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Labeled probes were mixed with
Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen), 10  blocking agent and 2  Hi-RPM hybridization
buffer (Agilent Technologies), and hybridized to an Agilent 244K Mouse
Genome CGH microarray. The samples were hybridized for 24 h at 67 1C
with constant agitation using a Pro Hybridization station HS 4800 (Tecan
US). The arrays were washed, dried and scanned using the Agilent scanner
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Agilent Technologies). Individual
log2 ratios of background-subtracted signal intensities were obtained from
the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 10.7. The log2 ratios were
centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each

probe were segmented using GLAD.49 All genes within the genomic
bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were assigned the mean copynumber value of the probes within that segment. Copy-number values
X0.3 log2 ratio units represented gain and values o ¼ 0.3 log2 ratio units
represented loss.

Exome capture and sequencing
Targeted sequence capture was performed using 3 mg of genomic DNA and
the SureSelectXT Mouse All Exon kit according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (Agilent Technologies). The Mouse All Exon kit is designed to
capture 49.6 Mb of a targeted region and covers 221 784 exons within
24 306 genes. The pre-capture library was ampliﬁed using four PCR cycles,
whereas 12 PCR cycles were used in post-capture ampliﬁcation. Fragment
size distribution of post-capture ampliﬁed libraries was determined using
Bioanalyzer 2100 using a DNA high-sensitivity chip (Agilent Technologies).
Concentration of the libraries was measured by the Kapa library
quantiﬁcation kit (Kapa Biosystems, Woburn, MA, USA). Each library was
sequenced on HiSeq 2000 to generate 2  75 bp reads per the
manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The sequencing
reads were mapped to the UCSC mouse genome (NCBI37/mm9) using the
BWA software50 set to default parameters. Local realignment, duplicate
marking and raw variant calling were performed as described previously.51
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms represented in dbSNP Build 13152 were
used to remove known germline variations. In addition, variants that
were present in both tumor and normal samples were removed as germline
variations. The remaining variations present in the tumor sample, but
absent in the matched normal, were predicted to be somatic. The predicted
somatic variations were additionally ﬁltered to include only positions with a
minimum of 10  coverage in both the tumor and matched normal, as well
as an observed variant allele frequency of o1% in the matched normal. The
effect of protein somatic mutation on gene function was predicted using
SIFT35 and PolyPhen36 (Supplementary Table 3).

Sanger sequencing
Spindle cell tumor from animal #113 (Supplementary Table 2) was analyzed
for Trp53 mutations using DNA derived from formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁnembedded material. We used a pair of nested primers (outer and inner) to
PCR-amplify the Trp53 exons (Supplementary Table 5). The inner primers were
m13-tagged to facilitate sequencing. The primers used for ampliﬁcation are
provided in Supplementary Table 5. PCR was performed using Platinum Taq
kit (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer’s protocols. The following parameters
were used for PCR ampliﬁcation: 94 1C for 2 min, followed 30 cycles of
denaturation at 94 1C for 30 s, annealing at 56 1C for 30 s and extension at
72 1C for 1 min. Samples, prior to analysis, were held at 4 1C after a ﬁnal
extension at 72 1C for 8 min. PCR products were puriﬁed using the ExoSAP-IT
kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and sequenced using ABI3730xl per the
manufacturer’s instructions (Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, USA).
Sequencing reads were analyzed using Sequencher (GeneCodes, Ann Arbor,
MI, USA).

Drug efﬁcacy study
Mammary tumor pieces were implanted subcutaneously near the
mammary fat pad of 8- to 10-week-old female C.B-17 SCID beige mice
weighing between 20 and 25 g (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington,
MA, USA). Tumors were monitored until they reached a mean tumor
volume of 200 -- 300 mm3, and animals were randomly distributed into four
groups of nine animals each before initiation of dosing. Mice were orally
gavaged daily for 13 days with 50, 100 and 150 mg/kg GDC-0941 dissolved
in 0.5% methylcellulose with 0.2% Tween 80 (MCT). Tumor sizes and
mouse body weights were recorded twice weekly over the course of the
study. Tumor volumes were measured in two dimensions using a caliper
and calculated using the following formula: Tumor size (mm3) ¼ (Longer
measurement  Shorter measurement2)  0.5. Percent weight change was
calculated using the following formula: Group percent weight change ¼ ((New weightInitial weight)/Initial weight)  100. Mean tumor
volumes (±s.e.m.) and percent weight change were calculated and

plotted using Kaleidagraph (version 4.03; Synergy Software, Reading, PA,
USA). Mice with tumor volumes X2000 mm3 or with losses in body weight
of X20% from initial body weight were promptly killed based on the
IACUC guideline. To analyze the repeated measurement of tumor volumes
from the same animals over time, a mixed modeling approach was used.53
This approach addresses both repeated measurements and modest
dropouts owing to any non-treatment-related death of animals before
study end. Cubic regression splines were used to ﬁt a non-linear proﬁle to
the time courses of log2 tumor volume at each dose level. These non-linear
proﬁles were then related to dose within the mixed model. Tumor growth
inhibition as a percentage of vehicle (%TGI) was calculated as the
percentage of the area under the ﬁtted curve (AUC) for the respective dose
group per day in relation to the vehicle, using the formula:
%TGI ¼ 100  (1AUCDose/AUCVeh). To get uncertainty intervals for %TGI,
the ﬁtted curve and the ﬁtted covariance matrix were used to generate a
random sample as an approximation to the distribution of %TGI. The
random sample is composed of 1000 simulated realizations of the ﬁttedmixed model, where %TGI has been re-calculated for each realization. Our
reported uncertainty interval is values for which 95% of the time the recalculated values of %TGI will fall in this region given the ﬁtted model. The
2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of the simulated distribution were used as the
upper and lower uncertainty intervals. Plots were generated using R
(version 2.8.1; R Development Core Team 2008, R Foundation for Statistical
Computing, Vienna, Austria) and Excel. Data were analyzed using R and the
mixed models were ﬁtted within R using the nlme package.53
