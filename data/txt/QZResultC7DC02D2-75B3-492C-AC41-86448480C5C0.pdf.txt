ABSTRACT
Exercise enhances learning and memory in animals and humans. The role of
peripheral factors that may trigger the beneficial effects of running on brain function
has been sparsely examined. In particular, it is unknown whether AMP-kinase (AMPK)
activation in muscle can predict enhancement of brain plasticity. Here we compare
the effects of running and administration of AMPK agonist 5-Aminoimidazole-4carboxamide 1-β-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR, 500 mg/kg), for 3, 7 or 14 days in onemonth-old male C57BL/6J mice, on muscle AMPK signaling. At the time-points where
we observed equivalent running- and AICAR-induced muscle pAMPK levels (7 and 14
days), cell proliferation, synaptic plasticity and gene expression, as well as markers of
oxidative stress and inflammation in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and
lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) were evaluated. At the 7-day time-point, both regimens
increased new DG cell number and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein
levels. Furthermore, microarray analysis of DG and LEC tissue showed a remarkable
overlap between running and AICAR in the regulation of neuronal, mitochondrial
and metabolism related gene classes. Interestingly, while similar outcomes for both
treatments were stable over time in muscle, in the brain an inversion occurred at
fourteen days. The compound no longer increased DG cell proliferation or neurotrophin
levels, and upregulated expression of apoptotic genes and inflammatory cytokine
interleukin-1β. Thus, an exercise mimetic that produces changes in muscle consistent
with those of exercise does not have the same sustainable positive effects on the
brain, indicating that only running consistently benefits brain function.

synaptogenesis and cognitive function [1, 9]. Moreover,
running up-regulates BDNF in the perirhinal cortex [10],
a brain area that, together with the lateral entorhinal cortex
(LEC), provides significant afferent input to adult-born
DG neurons [11].
Interestingly, the peripheral triggers that may elicit
the response of the central nervous system to running
remain unclear. Blocking systemic neurotrophic factors
such as insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) preclude exerciseinduced neurogenesis [12, 13]. Muscle activation may
result in release of myokines [14] that influence other
organs, including the brain. Muscle energy metabolism is
regulated by AMP-kinase (AMPK), a key energy-sensing
enzyme that is activated by a decrease in the ATP/AMP
ratio within cells [15]. AMPK lies at the core of complex
interconnected energy-sensing networks that include
other transcriptional co-activators, such as peroxisome

INTRODUCTION
Consistent evidence is emerging from both human
and animal research that exercise benefits brain function
throughout the lifespan. Physical activity may also
translate into prevention or delay of neurodegenerative
disorders [1, 2]. In the brain, underlying mechanisms
that have been investigated include neurotransmitters,
neurotrophins, fine neuronal morphology, blood flow,
angiogenesis and hippocampal neurogenesis [1, 3]. In
particular, the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus,
a region vulnerable to neurodegeneration [4] and crucial
for new memory formation, is positively influenced
by exercise [3, 5]. Voluntary wheel running increases
new DG neuron production [3], reduces hippocampal
neuroinflammation [6, 7] and elevates neurotrophin
levels, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
[8]. BDNF signaling is involved in cell survival,

proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha
(PGC-1α) [16]. Activation of this metabolic network [17]
increases catabolism [18], and reduces anabolic processes
[19]. Pharmacological or transgenic activation of these
transcription factors in muscle can mimic effects of
exercise on endurance [20], cognition, adult neurogenesis
[21, 22], and mood [23]. Conversely, lack of functional
AMPK in skeletal muscle precludes spatial memory
improvement [22].
It remains unclear how AMPK activation in muscle
affects brain function. In previous studies AMPK agonist
5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-β-D-ribofuranoside
(AICAR) improved memory function and neurogenesis
when administered for one week, but not upon longer
treatment [21]. Therefore, we compared the time-course
of peripheral and central effects of AICAR and exercise,
measuring energy pathway activation in muscle and
indices of hippocampal and cortical neural plasticity.
In particular, we aimed to determine effects of AICAR
and running on cell proliferation [21, 24], BDNF levels
[8, 9], inflammatory cytokines [6, 7, 25], oxidative
stress [26, 27], and gene expression in DG and LEC.
Our results show that, in muscle, effects of AICAR and
exercise overlap, while in the brain, cell proliferation,
neurotrophin levels and expression of neural plasticityrelevant genes are only transiently increased by AICAR.
Indeed, fourteen days of AICAR resulted in increased
expression of apoptotic genes and inflammatory
cytokine levels, and differentially regulated oxidative
stress markers. Our data indicate that prolonged
pharmacological activation of muscle energy metabolism
may hamper brain function.

measured (Figure 1B–1G). One way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) and Fisher’s post-hoc analysis showed a
significant increase in muscle pAMPK levels after
7  days for AICAR treated and running mice (F(2, 20) =
6.72, p < 0.006). At the 7-day time-point specific posthoc comparisons showed that both ACR7 (155 ± 9%) and
RUN7 (135 ± 3%) differed significantly from CTR7 (100 ±
16%; p < 0.05). After 14 days both treatments also showed
an increase of pAMPK levels (F(2, 19) = 7.35, p < 0.004)
compared to the control group. Post-hoc comparisons
revealed a significant up-regulation of ACR14 (169 ±
16%) and RUN14 (159 ± 19%) as compared to CTR14
(100 ± 4%; p < 0.05), (Figure 1B, 1C). Furthermore, a
parallel trend towards an increase in the expression levels
of PGC-1α was detected for both treatments after 7 days
(F(2, 21) = 3.11, p = 0.066). Significant elevations in PGC1α levels were observed after 14 days (F(2, 19) = 5.03,
p < 0.02), with specific comparisons showing that ACR14
(183 ± 22%) and RUN14 (171 ± 16%) differed from
CTR14 (100 ± 12%; p < 0.05), (Figure 1D, 1E). GLUT4
protein levels were augmented by AICAR at 7 days
(F(2, 21) = 3.73, p < 0.04). Post-hoc comparisons showed
that ACR7 (134 ± 8%), but not RUN7 (117 ± 7%) differed
significantly from CTR7 (100 ± 7%; p < 0.05). After 14
days, levels of GLUT4 are robustly up-regulated by both
treatments (F(2, 19) = 4.77, p < 0.02). Specific comparisons
indicated that both ACR14 (173 ± 17%) and RUN14 (167
± 16%) differ significantly from CTR14 (100 ± 13%;
p < 0.05), (Figure 1F, 1G).

AICAR and exercise elevate brain pAMPK
To assess whether AICAR activates the AMPK
pathway in the DG and LEC, we evaluated the expression
levels of pAMPK at 7 and 14 days of treatment (n = 4–8
per group). One way ANOVA showed no significant
increase in DG pAMPK levels at 7 days for both
treatments: ACR7 (114 ± 20%) and RUN7 (112 ± 9%)
as compared to CTR7 (100 ± 7%). However, a significant
elevation was recorded at 14 days (F(2, 13) = 7.682, p <
0.01), for both ACR14 (167 ± 19%) and RUN14 (168
± 18%) as compared to CTR14 (100 ± 21%; p < 0.05).
Interestingly, in the LEC only exercise increased pAMPK
levels at both time points: (F(2, 9) = 4.69, p < 0.04) RUN7
(147 ± 9%) as compared to CTR7 (100 ± 7%; p < 0.05)
and (F(2, 13) = 3.84, p < 0.05) RUN14 (140 ± 8%) as
compared to CTR14 (100 ± 14%; p < 0.05), whereas
neither ACR7 (102 ± 17%) nor ACR14 (94 ± 24%)
differed from respective controls (Figure 2A–2B).

RESULTS
AICAR and running increase AMPK pathway
proteins in muscle
To compare effects of AICAR and exercise in
muscle, we evaluated the activation of the AMPK
pathway. Specifically, the phosphorylation levels of
AMPK (pAMPK), and the expression levels of PGC-1α
and Glucose Transporter type 4 (GLUT4) were measured.
One-month-old male mice were divided into control
(CTR), AICAR (ACR) and exercise (RUN) groups
(n = 7–8 per group) and evaluated at three different time
points (3, 7 and 14 days). All animals received daily
saline (CTR, RUN) or AICAR (ACR) injections (Figure
1A, Table 1). The RUN groups had free access to running
wheels; daily running distances were not significantly
different (F(2, 26) = 0.73, p = 0.49) between RUN3 (3420 ±
726 m/day), RUN7 (3182 ± 381 m/day) and RUN14 (2649
± 329 m/day) groups. Gastrocnemius muscle tissue was
used for western blot analysis.
At the 3-day time-point no changes were observed
in any of the proteins (pAMPK, PGC-1α, GLUT-4)

BDNF levels (F(2, 18) = 4.28, p < 0.031), as evidenced
by a post-hoc comparison between RUN14 (223 ±
32%) and CTR14 (100 ± 22%; p < 0.05), whereas
AICAR treatment did not, (Figure 2C). No significant
increase in LEC BDNF levels was observed at these
time points (Figure 2D).

in RUN14 (159 ± 30%) but not in ACR14 (131 ±
16%). Interestingly, one way ANOVA showed that
AICAR increased LEC nNOS levels both after 7 days
(F(2, 13) = 3.814, p < 0.05) and 14 days (F(2, 13) = 5.269,
p < 0.05). AICAR elevated LEC nNOS in ACR7 (200 ±
22%) as compared to RUN7 (126.3 ± 25%) and CTR7
(100 ± 28%), and in ACR14 (135 ± 12.1%) as compared
to RUN14 (107 ± 3%) and CTR14 (100 ± 6%),
(Figure 3A–3B).
VEGFa expression also differed between AICAR
and exercise, albeit in LEC but not in DG. In the DG
both at 7 days and 14 days VEGFa expression did not
differ from CTR groups: ACR7 (101 ± 8%), RUN7 (97
± 8%) CTR7 (100 ± 10%), and ACR14 (89 ± 12%),
RUN14 (113 ± 8%) CTR14 (100 ± 3%). In the LEC
VEGFa expression was significantly affected by AICAR
after 14 days (F(2, 13) = 4.625, p < 0.05). Specifically,
VEGFa expression was increased in ACR14 (193 ±
30%), as compared to RUN14 (70 ± 11%) and CTR14
(100 ± 25%), whereas seven days of treatment had no
effect: ACR7 (86.7 ± 12%), RUN7 (80.9 ± 11%), CTR7
(100 ± 14%) (Figure 3C–3D).
A remarkable decrease in DG IL-1β levels induced
by both treatments was observed at 7days (F(2.13) = 3.814,
p < 0.05). Both ACR7 (22 ± 2%) and RUN7 (45 ± 8%)
showed reduced levels of IL-1β as compared to CTR7
(100 ± 24%). An inversion of AICAR’s effect, but not
of exercise, was recorded at 14 days (F(2, 13) = 3.712,
p = 0.052). ACR14 (197.3 ± 48%) induced an increase in
IL-1β levels, but not RUN14 (128.3 ± 29%) as compared
to CTR14 (100 ± 11%). LEC levels of IL-1β were not
detectable. (Figure 3E).

Dentate gyrus (DG) cell proliferation
The thymidine analog BrdU was injected daily
for seven days prior sacrifice. BrdU positive cells were
counted in the granule cell layer. One way ANOVA
revealed a significant increase in cell proliferation at
the 7-day time-point (F(2, 21) = 5.26, p < 0.01). Post-hoc
comparisons showed that ACR7 (11444 ± 533 cells;
126 ± 6%; p < 0.05) and RUN7 (13232 ± 1286 cells;
146 ± 14%) differed significantly from control, CTR7
(9092 ± 598 cells, 100 ± 7%; p < 0.05), (Figure 2E–2G).
Furthermore, as observed for DG BDNF levels at the
14 day time-point, cell proliferation was only increased
by running (F(2, 19) = 8.40, p < 0.002). Indeed, RUN14
(10867 ± 368 cells; 143 ± 5%), but not ACR14 (7996 ±
874 cells; 105 ± 12%), differed significantly from CTR14
(7589 ± 508 cells; 100% ± 7%), (Figure 2F–2G).

Differential effects of AICAR and exercise on
oxidative stress and inflammation markers
To assess whether divergent AICAR and
exercise outcomes observed after fourteen days
of treatment may be due to oxidative stress and
or inflammation in the brain, we evaluated the
expression levels of neuronal nitric oxide synthase
(nNOS) as an oxidative stress marker, of interleukin1β (IL-1β) as inflammatory marker and of vascular
endothelial growth factor a (VEGFa) as a measure
of vascularization. Protein levels were evaluated
both in DG and in LEC at 7 and 14 days of treatment
(n = 4–8 per group). No significant increase of nNOS
was recorded in the DG after 7 days of treatment:
ACR7 (91± 22%) and RUN7 (72 ± 9%) as compared
to CTR7 (100 ± 8%). One way ANOVA showed
divergent expression levels of DG nNOS after 14 days
(F(2, 13) = 3.814, p < 0.05) with a significant increase

Running decreases DG and LEC cytokines
Effects of running and AICAR on cytokine levels
in the DG and LEC of animals treated for 7 days and 14
days (n = 3–4) was evaluated. There was no change in
DG or LEC IL-4 and IL-12 levels with both treatments
after 7 days. After 14 days both IL-4 and IL-12 levels were
significantly affected in the DG (IL-4: F(2, 9) = 4.33, p <
0.05; IL-12: F(2, 9) = 4.78, p < 0.05). Specific comparisons
evidenced that RUN14 levels of IL-4 (48 ± 12%) and IL12 (23 ± 5%) were lower than that of controls: CTR14, DG

Similarly, one way ANOVA showed significant reductions

and LEC IL-12 levels (F(2, 6) = 5.52, p < 0.05). Post hoc
analysis showed LEC RUN14 levels of IL-4 (45 ± 8%)
and IL-12 (35 ± 10%) differed from CTR14 IL-4 (100 ±
4%) and IL-12 (100 ± 14%) levels (Figure 3G).

Microarray analysis of DG tissue showed a
considerable number of genes up- and down-regulated
by both treatments; 7 days of AICAR administration
up-regulated 453 genes and down-regulated 259, while
14 days of administration up-regulated 238 and downregulated 156. Interestingly, exercise affected more
genes than drug administration, increasing expression
of 760 genes and decreasing 596 genes after 7 days, and
increasing expression of 563 genes and reducing 502
genes after 14 days (Figure 4A).
In order to study similarities of gene regulation
between groups, the overlap of affected genes was
analyzed by comparing all groups. Specifically, we
compiled a Truth table and represented the overlapping
results in a Karnaugh map. Notably, the overlap between
7 days of AICAR (ACR7) and running (RUN7) was
strikingly higher (parallel up-regulation of 192 genes and

Regulation of gene expression by AICAR and
exercise
Microarray analysis of DG and LEC tissue derived
from animals in control, AICAR treated and running
groups was performed after 7 and 14 days of treatment.
Interestingly, the array results were consistent with the
transiently beneficial effects of AICAR treatment on the
brain. Parallel effects of exercise and AICAR on DG gene
expression were observed with 7 days, but not 14 days of
AICAR treatment.

AICAR (ACR14) and running (RUN14), (only 22 genes
are upregulated and 32 down-regulated in a parallel
fashion), (Figure 4B).
GO Term gene classes significance was reported
with a selector value equals 2 or −2 (z-ratio ≥ 1.5 or ≤ −1.5,
P-value ≤ 0.05, fdr ≤ 0.3, and average signal intensity > 0).
Overall results of all GO Term classes showed differences
between running and drug administration (Figure 4E).
Such divergence is maintained when analysis is restricted

to cellular components and molecular functions GO Term
classes (Supplementary Figure S1B), while a more parallel
effect between short-time running and AICAR emerges
in biological processes (Supplementary Figure S1A and
Figure S1C). We therefore restricted our analysis to classes
more relevant to brain function and metabolic activity.
Interestingly, results showed a remarkable effect on neuronrelated gene classes in the DG: genes important for synaptic
transmission and neuropeptide signaling are down-regulated
by both exercise and short term AICAR administration.

Lateral entorhinal cortex gene expression
profile

Seven days of treatment showed pronounced overlap of upand down-regulated genes, with 361 genes similarly affected
by AICAR and exercise in the DG. Of these selected genes
(z-ratio ≥ 1.5 or ≤ −1.5, P-value ≤ 0.05, fdr ≤ 0.3, and
average signal intensity > 0), 104 genes in DG are known
to directly affect neuronal plasticity and survival.
A striking difference between AICAR and exercise
appears after 14 days of treatment: with longer running
duration (RUN14), the examined GO Term neuro-related
classes maintain or even increase the down-regulation
observed after 7 days of treatment, while 14 days of
AICAR resulted in a prominent up-regulation in the DG
(Figure 5A). The inversion of gene regulation between 7
and 14 days of AICAR led us to select 31 genes in DG
that shifted from up- to down-regulation and vice-versa
(Figure 5D). In the DG, 16 of the selected genes are
known to be involved in neuronal plasticity processes;
e.g. Grit (a.k.a. p250GAP) (ACR7 = −1.67 fold, ACR14
= 1.97 fold), which regulates axon growth [28] and whose
up-regulation was shown to inhibit BDNF-induced axonal
branching [29]; Hap1 (ACR7 = −1.20 fold, ACR14 = 1.53
fold). Grit is involved in regulation of neuronal mTORC1
signaling and neuronal morphogenesis [30] and plays a
crucial role in postnatal neurogenesis and neurotrophin
receptor sorting [31]. In addition, Hspa1a (a.k.a. Hsp72)
(ACR7 = 1.24 fold, ACR14 = −1.51 fold), identified as
an oxidative stress- neuroprotective- astrocyte activator
[32], ATPase132a (ACR7 = −1.49 fold, ACR14 = 1.18
fold), previously shown to regulate neuronal integrity,
intracellular cation flux and mitochondrial morphology
[33], as well as Yme1l1 (ACR7 = 1.84 fold, ACR14
= −1.27 fold), involved in maintaining mitochondrial
functions [34].
We also analyzed energy- and mitochondrialrelated GO Term gene classes: our study showed effects
of both treatments on DG gene regulation; classes such
as mitochondrion, metabolic process, mitochondrial inner
membrane, fatty acid and glutathione metabolic processes,
are up-regulated at each time point of the exercise regimen
and by short term (7 days) AICAR administration. Once
again, a striking inversion of gene regulation appeared
after 14 days of drug treatment, with a remarkable downregulation of the analyzed classes (Figure 6A).
Moreover, in view of the lack of increase in
hippocampal proliferation after 14 days of AICAR
administration, we evaluated apoptosis- and cell deathrelated GO Term gene classes. The results showed an
up-regulation for gene classes that enhance apoptosis
(activation or increase of frequency, rate or extent of
cell death by apoptotic process) and a substantial downregulation for gene classes that decrease apoptotic
processes (Figure 6B).

Exercise and AICAR treatment modified the LEC
gene expression profile, albeit with a different pattern
than for the DG. Seven days of AICAR administration
up-regulated 491 genes and down-regulated 369, while
14 days of administration up-regulated 520 and downregulated 290. In contrast to the DG, exercise and AICAR
affected LEC more equally, with running increasing
expression of 453 genes and decreasing 288 genes after 7
days, and increasing expression of 590 genes and reducing
397 genes after 14 days (Figure 4C). The overlap of
affected genes was analyzed by comparing all groups. The
resulting Karnaugh map is reported in Figure 4D. Similar
to gene regulation in the DG, the overlap between 7 days
of AICAR and running was strikingly higher (parallel upregulation of 160 gene and down-regulation of 103 genes)
than between 14 days of AICAR and running (only 26
genes are up-regulated and 10 down-regulated in a parallel
fashion).
The overall comparison of all GO Term classes
in the LEC showed that treatment duration is the main
factor for class profile similarity: short-term treatment
of both AICAR and exercise are more similar to each
other than to their respective long-term group (Figure
4E). Such parallel regulation is maintained when analysis
is restricted to the three GO Term class subgroups,
biological processes, cellular components and molecular
functions (Supplementary Figure S1A–S1B–S1C). More
specifically, 14 days of AICAR up-regulated neuro-related
gene classes, similar to the pattern observed in the DG of
the ACR14 group (Figure 5A). Furthermore, as observed
in the DG, longer running (14 days) down-regulated
neuro-related gene classes.
For further evaluation we selected LEC genes that
switched from up- to down-regulation between short
(ACR7) and long (ACR14) drug treatment (Figure 5E).
Of the 59 selected genes 18 are known to be involved in
neuronal survival and plasticity processes. For example,
Calr (ACR7 = −1.47 fold, ACR14 = 1.58 fold), affects Ca+
influx and is linked with neurogenesis as well as neuronal
development [35]. In addition, the genes Ddt (ACR7 =
1.46 fold, ACR14 = −1.36 fold) a possible neurotrophic
factor [36]; Ptpn1 (ACR7 = 1.62 fold, ACR14 = −1.42

impairment of AMPK activation [37]; Notch1 (ACR7 =
1.56 fold, ACR14 = −1.47 fold), important for postnatal
neurogenesis, dendritic morphology [38], and synaptic
plasticity [39]; and Rab7 (ACR7 = 1.28 fold, ACR14 =
−1.44 fold) when down-regulated affects axonal transport
and diminishes NGF retrograde signaling [40].

The microarray data also revealed genes so far
not known to play major roles in neuronal plasticity and
cognitive function, but that are nonetheless regulated in a
similar fashion and intensity to neuro-related genes.

Novel target genes in dentate gyrus
In the DG the groups ACR7 and RUN7 induced
similar regulation of 361 genes, of which only 104 are

respectively still unknown; unidentified; and play a role in
breast, lung and skin cancer [59] (Table 3).

DISCUSSION
Our study demonstrates that voluntary exercise
and AICAR administration similarly activate muscle
metabolism. Initial elevations of muscle AMPK were
observed after seven days and robust up-regulation
occurred after fourteen days of interventions. In the brain,
seven days of AICAR or running increased dentate gyrus
BDNF protein levels and cell proliferation. However,
longer pharmacological activation did not result in changes
in cell genesis or neurotrophin levels and may even be
detrimental. In particular, microarray analysis showed
an inversion of DG gene regulation, such as increased
expression of pro-apoptotic genes, with long-term AICAR
treatment. In addition, markers of inflammation were
up-regulated in the DG and LEC after fourteen days of
AICAR treatment, whereas running reduced inflammatory
cytokine levels. Thus, while both interventions may have
similar effects on muscle energy metabolism, only running
continuously benefits brain function.
AMPK activation in muscle is an important factor in
regulating mitochondrial proteins and exercise endurance

RT-qPCR validates microarray results
The qPCR results were consistent with the
microarray findings. Four relevant genes were selected
for qPCR validation of microarray results (n = 4). All
chosen genes presented a selector value equals 2 or −2
(z-ratio ≥ 1.5 or ≤ −1.5, p ≤ 0.05, fdr ≤ 0.3, and average
signal intensity > 0). RT-qPCR was conducted for Grit
and VegfA (DG) and Tnnc1 and Dbp (LEC) at 7 and 14
days of treatment. Specifically, one way ANOVA and
post-hoc analysis showed that Grit was significantly
down-regulated in DG at 7 days (F(2, 6) = 115.0, p <
0.001) for both treatments (ACR7 = 0.49 ± 0.05 fold, p <
0.05; RUN7 = 0.23 ± 0.02 fold, p < 0.05) and at 14 days
(F(2, 11) = 16.4, p < 0.001; ACR14 = 1.46 ± 0.12, p < 0.05;

training [60]. We made side-by-side comparisons in vivo
over time to determine effects of exercise and AICAR on
multiple components of the energy-sensing network in
muscle, including pAMPK, PGC-1α and GLUT4. Our
data show that all three components were up-regulated in
muscle to a similar extent by AICAR and exercise after 14
days of treatment. In human and rodent skeletal muscle,
pAMPK levels increase acutely after a bout of exercise
[61] and after 15, 30, and 60 minutes or 48 hours of brief
AICAR administration [62]. Previous studies on chronic
exercise training for 12 weeks in rodents also showed a
notable increase in basal levels of pAMPK in peripheral
tissues, such as skeletal muscle [20], liver and adipose
tissue [63]. In addition, training up-regulates PGC-1α and
overexpression of PGC-1α in muscle increases exercise
performance [64]. Indeed, the effect of AMPK activation
on PGC-1α is considered an important factor in regulating
exercise training-induced adaptations, and may also
mediate the AMPK-induced elevation in mRNA levels
of GLUT4. This is supported by research showing that
activation of AMPK in PGC-1α knock-out mice does not
induce GLUT4 expression [65]. It should be noted that
GLUT4 increased more slowly over time with running
than by compound administration, suggesting that despite
similar effects on the primary targets (pAMPK and PGC1α), AICAR and exercise may differentially activate
downstream signaling pathways. Indeed, more detailed
analysis of both interventions in muscle may further
understanding of their influence on brain function.
Several recent studies support the concept that
muscle mediated signaling factors may influence brain
plasticity. Administration of AMPK agonist AICAR
enhances endurance in sedentary mice and functions as
an ‘exercise-mimetic’ [20], improving adult neurogenesis
and memory function [21]. The effects of the compound
are likely indirect as AICAR has a low ability to
cross the blood brain barrier [66]. Upon intracerebral
infusion memory function and long-term potentiation in
hippocampal slices are reduced [67]. In addition, AICAR
does not improve spatial memory in mice selectively
lacking functional AMPK in muscle, suggesting an
indirect mechanism of action and a link between muscle
and brain [22]. Further support for the idea that muscle
energy metabolism affects brain function comes from a
recent study showing that over-expression of PGC-1α in
mouse muscle affects the kynurenine pathway and protects
these mice from stress induced reduction of synaptic
plasticity proteins in the brain, as well as from exhibiting
depression-like behaviors [23, 68]. Overexpression
of PGC-1α in muscle also has been reported to lead to
increased production of Fibronectin type III domain
containing 5 (FNDC5), a myokine that is released during
exercise [69]. Enzymatic cleavage of FNDC5 generates a
peptide called irisin, which may enter the brain and induce
hippocampal BDNF gene expression [70].

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In the brain, AMPK protein levels were up-regulated
in the DG by exercise and AICAR to a similar extent as in
muscle at the longer time-point (14 days), but not earlier
(7 days). Consistently, thirty days of running elevates
hippocampal PGC-1α levels, and eight weeks of treadmill
training elevates PGC-1α and Sirtuin 1, increasing brain
mitochondrial biogenesis [70]. In addition, eight weeks of
voluntary exercise increased phosphorylation of AMPK
in the hippocampus of senescence-accelerated mice
[71]. These changes may mediate synaptic plasticity and
spine formation [70, 72]. However, we observe that the
beneficial effects of AICAR and exercise on the brain
(increased DG cell genesis and BDNF levels at 7 days)
precede brain energy metabolism protein level changes
(at 14 days in DG and LEC), indicating these may be
unnecessary for enhancement of neural plasticity. Indeed,
in Alzheimer’s Disease mouse models, prolonged brain
AMPK activation may contribute to detrimental effects
on synaptic plasticity and memory formation, by inducing
long-lasting cellular stress and impairing protein synthesis
[73].
A novel observation in the present study is that
AICAR treatment elevates BDNF protein levels. However
the increase was observed only after 7 days of AICAR
treatment, whereas exercise consistently elevated BDNF
DG protein levels. It should be noted that our microarray
data did not show an exercise-induced increase in BDNF
mRNA in the DG at these time-points, consistent with
several other short-term [74] or short-distance studies
[75], but not other running research [76, 77] analyzing
whole hippocampus. Longer running paradigms elevate
DG BDNF mRNA levels [78]. In the LEC, no increase
in BDNF protein levels was found at 7 and 14 days with
either intervention, and a reduction in BDNF mRNA
was observed. Longer term running, however, elevates
BDNF protein levels in the adjacent perirhinal cortex
[8]. Overall, there appears to be dissociation between the
effects of the interventions on BDNF protein levels and
gene expression at the different time-points and in both
brain regions examined. These discrepancies may be due
in part to transport of BDNF from other brain regions [79].
The effects of both treatments were evaluated on
DG and LEC protein expression of the oxidative stress
marker nNOS. Running increases nNOS in the DG (after
14 days) but not in the LEC. Treatment with AICAR,
on the other hand, does not increase expression in the
DG but elevates nNOS levels in the LEC at both time
points. This differential modulation, depending both on
treatment length and brain region, led us to hypothesize
that oxidative stress modulators may be, at least in
part, responsible for the lack of improvement of brain
functions after longer AICAR treatment. Both nitric
oxide (NO) and nNOS affect neurogenesis and neuronal
differentiation in vitro [80] and in vivo [81]. Furthermore,
modulation of nNOS in rodents was shown to affect the

18305

Oncotarget

rate of neurogenesis in the DG [82]. Moreover, glucoseinhibited neurons undergo an increase in nNOS activity
and a reduction of pAMPK upon increasing glucose
concentrations [83]; this correlation between nNOS
increase and kinase reduction is similar to our findings on
LEC protein levels. AICAR increases LEC nNOS levels
without promoting AMPK activation, while running
activates AMPK with no increase in nNOS. Further
analyses of the modulation of NO by these treatments
may clarify possible direct and indirect mechanisms of
action.
In previous studies a wide range of doses and
duration of administration of AICAR showed beneficial
effects of this compound on peripheral processes. Lower
AICAR concentrations than used in our study (0.25 mg/
kg/day for two weeks) in mice improved vascular endo­
thelial dysfunction [84]. In addition, administration of
8 mg/kg/min AICAR for 2 hours significantly inhibited
glucose production in rodents [85]. We utilized the 500
mg/kg dose because previous studies showed enhanced
endurance [20] and memory function [21]. In addition,
longer durations of treatment than in our study (4 weeks
[20] and 7 weeks [86], 500 mg/kg/day) and higher dosage
(1g/kg [87, 88]) had beneficial effects on endurance
[20], glucose tolerance and systolic blood pressure [86],
myokine release [87] and skeletal muscle vascularization
factors levels [88]. In the brain, however, we observed an
increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines and angiogenic
factors, namely an increase of IL-1β levels in the DG and
an up-regulation of VEGFa in the LEC after 14 days of
AICAR treatment. Pro-inflammatory molecules are known
to affect angiogenesis. VEGFa and other angiogenic
molecules can affect inflammation in a plethora of ways
[89]. Specifically, cytokines like IL-1β and associated
angiogenic modulators are reported to be a crucial
component of brain and systemic degeneration processes
in aging [90, 91] and in degenerative diseases [92, 93, 94],
such as conversion from Mild Cognitive Impairment into
Alzheimer’s disease (for a review see [95]). Conversely,
exercise is known to reduce inflammatory processes in the
brain [6, 7, 96]. Consistently, we observed reduced levels
of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-4 and IL-12 with
running.
To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the
similarities and differences between AICAR and exercise
treatment in the DG and LEC, we performed microarray
analysis that matched the time-points of the cellular data.
Gene regulation was consistent with plasticity results,
showing a parallel regulation of neuro- and energy-related
genes at short time points. An inversion of gene expression
occurred upon prolonged pharmacological treatment. The
neuro-related gene classes are down-regulated at short
time points (ACR7 and RUN7) in the DG, and continue
to be down-regulated at the longer time point (RUN14).
However, a striking up-regulation appears when AICAR
administration is extended (ACR14), including elevation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of expression of genes important for apoptosis. In a
parallel although different way, LEC gene neuro-related
classes showed up-regulation at short time points (ACR7
and RUN7), but, as observed for the DG, gene regulation
switches to remarkable down-regulation after longer
training (RUN14). Longer pharmacological treatment
with AICAR (14 days), however, prevented the onset of
the down-regulation and maintained LEC gene classes upregulated.
Our microarray data indicate that exercise and
AICAR have a remarkable effect on gene regulation in
DG and LEC. There are substantial differences between
the two brain regions depending on the duration of the
treatment and on the gene classes considered. In the LEC
genes related to energy and mitochondrial regulation
were modified by the interventions, whereas in the DG
expression of neuro-related genes was altered. These data
show that external stimuli, such as exercise and AICAR
administration, target different functions in different brain
areas in specific ways. Indeed, many of the running studies
microarray analyses in rodents have been focused on the
hippocampus [76, 97]. Regionally-specific differences are
of interest, in the light of recent studies on gene profiles
of various human brain regions. Such studies reported
marked regional differences with aging in gene profiles
of entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, with respect to
other brain regions [98]. In addition, within the human
brain metabolic differences between cortex (high glucose
consumption) and other brain regions have been reported
[99], which may be linked directly to synaptic plasticity.
Exercise-mimetics may be a promising alternative
to physical activity in promoting brain function in aging
or neurodegenerative diseases. However, muscle AMPK
pathway activation may not predict central effects of such
interventions. Even though exercise and AICAR resulted
in similar muscle changes, in the brain differential patterns
of responsiveness to drug administration developed over
time. AICAR switched from being comparable to exercise
to upregulating markers of apoptosis and inflammation.
Thus, development of pharmacological agents that can
consistently and safely mimic effects of exercise on the
brain may prove to be challenging.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects and procedures
A cohort of 82 C75BL/6J male mice was purchased
from the Jackson laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The onemonth-old mice were individually housed in standard
conditions with food and water ad libitum. Animals were
divided into 3 groups [control (CTR), AICAR treated
(ACR), voluntary running (RUN)] for experiments of
3, 7 or 14 days duration. ACR mice received a daily
intraperitoneal injection (IP) of 5-aminoimidazole-4carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR, Toronto
18306

Oncotarget

Research Chemicals Inc., Canada) of 500 mg/kg/day,
dissolved in saline, similar to previous studies [20, 21,
22]; CTR and RUN animals received IP saline vehicle.
RUN animals had free access to running wheels.
Running distance was recorded using Clocklab software
(Actimetrics, Wilmette, IL). A subset of the mice (n = 46)
was treated in the same conditions (CTR, ACR, RUN),
but also received daily bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) IP
injections (BrdU; dissolved in 0.9% saline, filtered sterile
at 0.2 μm, 50 mg/kg body weight at 10 μg/ml; Sigma
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 7 days prior to sacrifice.
See Table 1 for complete description of the design
and experimental groups. At the end of the scheduled
treatment, animals were sacrificed after deep anesthesia
with isofluorane (Henry Schein Animal Health, OH).
The dentate gyrus (DG), lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC)
and gastrocnemius muscle (left and right) were collected
and immediately frozen and stored at –80°C for further
experiments. The subset of BrdU treated mice were
deeply anesthetized with isofluorane and transcardially
perfused with 0.9% saline. DG and LEC (left brain
hemisphere) and gastrocnemius muscle (left and right)
were collected and immediately frozen and stored at
−80°C until processing for Western Blot and ELISA
analysis. The right brain hemispheres were immediately
stored and fixed in 4% ice cold paraformaldehyde (PFA)
for 96 hours, and then equilibrated in 30% phosphate
buffered sucrose for at least 48 hours. Coronal sections
(40 μm) were taken sequentially through the rostralcaudal extent of the hippocampus using a freezing
microtome (Thermofisher, Rockville, MD) and stored at
−20°C in phosphate-buffered glycerol.

CA) was used as a marker. Comparisons to non-perfused
muscle tissue (n = 4 per group) were made as an additional
control, and showed that saline perfusion did not affect
phosphorylation and protein levels (data not shown).

ELISA assay for BDNF quantification in dentate
gyrus and lateral entorhinal cortex
BDNF quantification was performed using BDNF
Emax ImmunoAssay System (Promega, Madison WI)
according to manufacturer specifications. Briefly,
frozen tissue were thawed in Promega lysis buffer,
homogenized and then diluted 1:2.5 with ice-cold PBS;
after an acidification step, total protein concentration
was quantified via Bradford assay. Elisa polystyrene
plates were incubated anti-BDNF monoclonal antibody
(1:1000) in carbonate coating buffer before adding
protein samples or standards. After being tagged with
anti-human BDNF antibody (1:500) and with anti-IgY
horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:200), plates were
treated with Promega TMB One Solution. To stop the
reaction, 1N HCl was used. Plates were read at 450 nm
with a Multiskan Ascent Plate Reader. Results were
normalized against total protein amount.

BrdU immunohistochemistry and cell counts

broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/collection_details.jsp#C2,
Gene Ontology Database [http://www.geneontology.org/];
GAD human disease and mouse phenotype gene sets [103,
104] were used to explore functional level changes. The
data discussed in this article have been deposited in NCBI’s
Gene Expression Omnibus [105] and are accessible through
GEO Series accession number GEO #: GSE64607.

Sections (40 μm) were stained for BrdU as
previously reported [100]. Specifically, a one-in-six series
of sections (240 μm apart) was pre-incubated with 0.6%
H2O2 for 30 min, incubated in 2 N HCl at 37°C for 30 min,
and then neutralized in 0.1 M Borate buffer at RT. After
multiple washings, sections were blocked using TBS++ for
30 min at R.T., and subsequently incubated with rat antiBrdU (1:200, Accurate Chemical, Westbury NY) overnight
at 4°C. After washing in TBS and TBS++, sections were
incubated for 2 h with biotin-SP-conjugated donkey antirat IgG (1:250, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove,
PA), and then washed in TBS and incubated for 2 h in ABC
reagent (Vectastain Elite; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,
CA). The substrate 3, 3-diaminobenzidine (DAB; D4418,
Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was applied for 5 min. BrdUpositive cells were counted through a 20 × objective
(Olympus, BX51, Center Valley, PA) and multiplied by six
to obtain the total number of new DG cells [101].

RT-qPCR for illumina microarray analysis
validation
Illumina microarray data were validated with RT-qPCR
performed on the mRNA samples previously described.
Reverse transcription was carried out on 0.5 μg of RNA using
qScript cDNA Supermix (Quanta Bioscience) according to
manufacturer protocol; primers for the selected genes Tnnc1,
Bdnf, Grit, VegfA, and Hsp90 were purchased from Integrated
DNA Technologies using IDT online primer designer. The
specific sequence of each of the primers was as follows:

Microarray analysis on dentate gyrus and lateral
entorhinal cortex
Total RNA was extracted using the Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) according to the manu­
facturer’s protocol. Samples RNA amount and purity were
quantified using a Nanodrop (Thermo scientific, Waltham,
MA); the 3 most pure and concentrated samples were
chosen for microarray analysis. Samples were hybridized
to MouseRef-8 v1 Expression beadchips (Illumina)
following protocols listed on the Gene Expression
and Genomics Unit of the NIA (http://www.grc.nia.
nih.gov/branches/rrb/dna/index/protocols.htm).
Micro­
array fluorescent signals were extracted using an Illumina
BeadArray 500GX reader. The signals on each sample
are normalized by log z-transformation to obtained zscores and tests for distributions as previously described
[102]. Correlation analysis, sample clustering analysis,
and principal component analysis include all of the probes
and were performed to identify/exclude any possible
outliers. The resulting dataset was next analyzed with
DIANE6.0, a spreadsheet-based microarray analysis
program. After normalization by log z-transformation,
the statistically significant gene list for each comparison
condition was selected upon the conditions of (1) the probe
signal detection P-value ≤0.02, (2) one way ANOVA over
sample groups was P-value <0.05, (3) pairwise z-test
P-value <0.05, (4) false discovery rates are <0.30, and
(5) gene expression changes measured by z-ratio were not
less than 1.5 the mean of their absolute values. Further
clustering/correlation analyses were done based on these
selection criteria. Gene set enrichment analysis used gene
expression change values (z-ratio) for the average of all of
the genes on the microarray. Parametric analysis of gene set
enrichment (PAGE) was used [103] for gene set analysis.
Gene Sets include the MSIG database (http://www.

All primers were tested by melting curve analysis
for specificity for one single amplicon product. qPCR was
performed with SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Life
Technologies, Grand Island NY) on an Illumina Eco RealTime PCR. Results were analyzed using the Comparative
Ct method.

Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using
Statview (Abacus Corporation, Baltimore, MD). Ana­
lysis of immunoblotting, immunohistological and
enzymatic assays results were carried out with one way
analysis of variance (ANOVA). Post-hoc analysis was
performed using either Fisher’s test or Games-Howell’s
test, depending on the sample-variance and sample-size.
Results are expressed as mean ± S.E.M.
