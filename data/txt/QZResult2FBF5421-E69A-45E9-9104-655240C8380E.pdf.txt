BACKGROUND. It is believed widely that chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment occurs in a subgroup of patients with breast cancer. However, recent
reports have provided no evidence that chemotherapy affects cognition. In this
study, the authors questioned whether cognitive compromise in patients with
breast cancer is attributable to chemotherapy. In addition, the effects of therapyinduced menopause and of the erythropoiesis-stimulating factor darbepoetin a
on cognitive performance were assessed.

METHODS. A battery of neuropsychological tests was used to assess cognitive per1

formance in 101 patients with breast cancer before neoadjuvant chemotherapy
(T1) and toward the end of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (T2) with combined epirubicin, paclitaxel, and cyclophosphamide with concomitant darbepoetin a.
Repeated-measures multiple analyses of variance and a reliable-change approach
were used for statistical analyses.

RESULTS. At T1, the group means ranged below the test norms in 5 of 12 cognitive tests. At T2, multiple analyses of variance (MANOVA) indicated a significant
overall improvement in the test results (P < .001). After correcting for practice
effects, cognitive decline predominated in 27% of patients, whereas improvement
predominated in 28% of patients. Cognitive performance was not related significantly to self-reported cognitive problems, anxiety and depression, menopause,
or darbepoetin a administration.

CONCLUSIONS. Even before chemotherapy, a subgroup of patients with breast
cancer showed cognitive compromise that was unrelated to anxiety or depression. During chemotherapy, cognitive function remained stable in most patients,
improved in a subgroup, and deteriorated in another subgroup. The deterioration
may have been caused by side effects of chemotherapy, but it also may have

any patients with breast cancer report chemotherapy-associated cognitive compromise. In 1995, in the first of a series of
cross-sectional studies with early breast cancer patients, cognitive
impairment was observed after cytostatic treatment in 75% of
patients.1 Although the results of subsequent cross-sectional trials
assessing cognitive function during or after chemotherapy2–7 were
less dramatic, all of them reported substantial cognitive impairment
rates of 16% to 50%, suggesting detrimental cytostatic side effects

on cognitive function in a subgroup of patients with
breast cancer. The first 3 reports that were published
on longitudinal studies provided further support for
this hypothesis.8–10 Thus, the existence of chemo
brain has become almost universally accepted,11
although many details of the concept are controversial or obscure. The reported rates of cognitively
impaired patients vary widely, reflecting different
definitions of impairment.11 Data regarding affected
cognitive domains and the duration of cognitive disturbance are far from being congruent.5,12,13 It
remains unknown which cytostatic agents are responsible for cognitive impairment, which characteristics make patients vulnerable,14 and which biologic
mechanisms are involved.15
Some doubts regarding the evidence for chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment have been
raised by 3 recently published studies that failed to
confirm the adverse effects of chemotherapy on cognitive function.16–18 Meta-analyses also consistently
have stated that it depends on the study design
whether chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment
is observed, with more appropriate designs resulting
in less clear evidence or no evidence of chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment.19–21
Currently, we are conducting a multicenter, prospective study entitled Cognitive Impairment in
Therapy of Breast Cancer (COGITO). Cognitive function in early breast cancer patients is assessed before
the start of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, toward the
end of chemotherapy, and 1 year after the baseline
assessment. The study is ongoing; this report describes the findings from the first 2 assessments.
The objective of the study was to assess the
course of cognitive function before and after exposure to cytostatic treatment and, thus, to test the hypothesis that the cognitive dysfunction observed in
patients with breast cancer is induced by chemotherapy. Our secondary objectives were to determine the
impact of therapy-induced menopause and the effect
of concomitant medication with darbepoetin a on cognition. Darbepoetin a is a hyperglycosylated, humanrecombinant erythropoietin, and favorable effects of
erythropoietin on cognitive performance during adjuvant chemotherapy have been reported.22

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
All patients who had been included in the Preoperative Epirubicin Paclitaxel Aranesp (PREPARE) trial
between July 2003 and March 2005 at 5 gynecologic
or oncologic centers in Germany were eligible for
participation in COGITO if they were fluent in Ger-

man. Participants in the PREPARE trial are between
ages 18 years and 65 years, have breast carcinomas that measure 2 cm or inflammatory lesions,
and have no evidence of metastases. In the PREPARE
trial, patients are assigned randomly to receive
standard chemotherapy (epirubicin 90 mg/m2 and
cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 on Day 1 every 21
days for 4 cycles; paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 on Day 1 every 21 days for 4 cycles) or dose-intensified therapy
(epirubicin 150 mg/m2 on Day 1 every 14 days for 3
cycles; paclitaxel 225 mg/m2 on Day 1 every 14 days
for 3 cycles; combined cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil on Days 1 and 8 every 28 days
for 3 cycles), and are subrandomized to receive concomitant anemia prophylaxis with darbepoetin a
(Aranesp; Amgen Ltd., Munich, Germany) (1 3 4.5
lg/kg every 2 weeks; medication is suspended if hemoglobin exceeds 14 g/dL). Patients who terminated
chemotherapy prematurely continued to be included
in COGITO if they received 4 cycles of chemotherapy.
For the sake of representativeness, we did not establish rigid exclusion criteria. Instead, we performed
analyses twice—including all patients and including
only patients who were not affected by potential confounders. Features that were considered to be confounding factors were daily alcohol intake of >2
drinks, use of medication known to affect cognition,
and a history of a central nervous system disorder.
The nonnative speakers who participate in the study,
although they are fluent in German, still may be handicapped slightly on the language-related tests; thus,
not being a native speaker of German also was
regarded as a confounder.
Written informed consent was provided by all
patients. The study was approved by the ethics committees at all of the universities involved.

Assessments
The first assessment (T1; baseline) was conducted
before the start of preoperative chemotherapy and 1
week after diagnosis at the earliest. The second assessment (T2) was scheduled between the penultimate
and the final chemotherapy session—ie, approximately
5 months after the baseline assessment.
A battery of cognitive tests was compiled that
was sensitive for detecting dysfunction in a wide
range of cognitive domains. Twelve standardized and
widely used tests were included: Logical Memory I
and II (verbal memory) from the Wechsler Memory
Scale-Revised (WMS-R),23 Digit Span Forward (verbal
short-term memory, attention) and Digit Span Backward (verbal working memory) from the WMS-R,
Digit Symbol (psychomotor function, information

the Regensburg Word Fluency Test (RWT)30 with the
subtests Lexical Search, Semantic Search, Lexical
Search with Change of Category, and Semantic
Search with Change of Category (executive function).
With the word-fluency tests, parallel forms were used
to minimize practice effects.
The MWT-B,31 a validated, language-related test,
was used to estimate premorbid intelligence. Testees
are required to find correct words among nonsense
neologisms. The test was taken once at T2.
Patients’ self-reports of cognitive functioning were
covered by the Fragebogen erlebter Defizite der Aufmerksamkeit [Questionnaire of Experienced Attention
Deficits (FEDA)],32 a validated questionnaire of attention
deficits experienced in daily life, and the Cognitive Function Scale of the European Organization for Research
and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality-of-life Questionnaire C30, version 3.0.33,34 The Hospital Anxiety and
Depression Scale (HADS)35 was used to measure current
levels of depression and anxiety symptoms.
All of the assessments were conducted by 1 of 2
university-qualified psychologists, either in patients’
homes or in a hospital. Tests and questionnaires
were administered in a fixed order.

Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were carried out using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), ver-

sion 13 or 14. Statistical tests were 2-sided.
Significance was calculated with a 5% probability of
error (except for reliable-change index calculations;
see below).
For comparisons with test norms, either 1-sample t tests or binomial tests, as appropriate, were performed. Test norms for TMT-A and TMT-B were
taken from a United States normative study.28 For all
other tests, we used norms that were representative
of the German population.23–25,30 All norms were
stratified for age.
For group comparisons of the T1 and T2 results
of cognitive tests, a repeated-measures MANOVA was
carried out, thus avoiding inflation of a error by multiple testing. To determine whether differences
between an individual patient’s T2 and T1 test results
were caused by measurement error or reflected a
change in cognitive ability, we used the reliablechange index (RCI) developed by Jacobson and
Truax.36 Setting the probability of error at 10%, we
calculated the RCI for each pair of T1 and T2 test
results, using the standard deviation of the T1 test
results, and published test-retest reliabilities.23,24,27,37
Practice effects were to be expected for Logical
Memory I and II, TMT-A, TMT-B, and Digit Symbol,38,39 but not for Digit Spans Forward and Backward.23,39 To correct the RCI for practice effects, we
used practice effects observed in healthy control
groups in normative studies (Table 1).23,40,41 The D2
Test had to be excluded from this analysis because of
a lack of data about the practice effects. In addition,
the word-fluency tests were excepted from RCI analyses; because, with these tests, parallel forms were
applied that could not be compared directly.

Spearman rank correlations were calculated for
each patient’s number of deteriorated test results corrected for practice effects with self-reported cognitive
function, anxiety, and depression. Repeated-measures
MANOVAs were performed to assess effects of darbepoetin a and of therapy-induced menopause.

RESULTS
The participation criteria were met by 160 patients. Of
these, 26 patients (16%) declined to participate. For
another 21 patients (13%), it was not possible to
arrange an assessment session before the start of therapy. Of 113 patients who were recruited into the study,
4 patients were excluded as screening failures, and 109
patients completed the T1 assessment. At T2, 2
patients declined further participation, and 6 patients
had to be excluded because they discontinued chemotherapy before completing the fourth cycle (attrition
rate, 7.3%). Four of the remaining 101 patients had
received fewer chemotherapy cycles than scheduled.
At T1, 18 patients had potential confounders (see
Materials and Methods, above), including alcohol
intake in 2 patients, central nervous system disorders
in 6 patients, medications in 7 patients, and 3 patients who were nonnative German-language speakers. At T2, another 6 patients had started medications

that were considered confounding (mostly antidepressants), and 1 patient had acquired an unclear
neurologic problem (symptoms of paralysis).
With regard to premorbid intelligence and educational levels, the sample was in the above-average
range (mean intelligence quotient, 108), and 34%
had 12 years of education (compared with 22%
in the general German population matched for age).
Table 2 lists the demographic data for the sample.

Before the Start of TherapyT1
The group mean scores for 5 cognitive tests showed
significantly poorer scores than the test norms,
whereas the group mean score for 1 test was significantly better than the norm (Table 3). If 18 patients
with confounders were excluded, then the scores for
4 tests remained significantly poorer than the norms
(no longer including the RWT Semantic Search),
whereas 3 tests were significantly better (in addition,
the Digit Span Forward and the RWT Semantic
Search with Change of Category).
On an individual level, 33 patients (31%) had 2
test results in the lower 5% range, and 29 patients
(27%) had 2 test results in the upper 5% range (Fig.
1). The percentages changed marginally (30% and 27%,
respectively) if patients with confounders were excluded. The number of test results in the lower 5%
range was correlated significantly with premorbid intelligence (Spearman q ¼ 0.34; P ¼ .001), and education (Spearman q ¼ 0.39; P < .001), but not with
anxiety, depression, or self-reported cognitive function.
If the method of determining cognitive impairment used in the frequently cited study by Wieneke
and Dienst had been applied,1 then we would have
had to classify 61 patients (56%) with at least mild
cognitive impairment (>1 test result 1 standard
deviation [SD]), with 35 patients (32%) demonstrating moderate cognitive impairment (in addition, 1
test result 2 SD). If patients with confounders present at T1 were excluded, then the percentages changed marginally (31% moderately impaired).
Toward the End of ChemotherapyT2
The mean interval between the T1 and the T2 assessments was 20.9 weeks (SD, 1.3 weeks). With the
exception of 2 tests, the group mean scores were
within or above the test norms at T2 (Table 3).
Repeated-measures MANOVA of 93 data sets that
were complete for T1 and T2 indicated a significant
overall improvement [P < .001; effect size (partial Eta
squared) h2p ¼ 0.59]. Improvement reached significance in 6 tests (Table 4). Deterioration was observed
in only 1 test (RWT Semantic Search with Change of
Category) and reached significance. With that test,

Forty-eight patients received standard chemotherapy, and 53 patients received dose-intensified
chemotherapy. The results from MANOVA showed no
effects associated with the treatment arm (interaction time*treatment arm: P ¼ .64).
In the individual RCI analyses, 100 patients with
1 missing test result were included. Deterioration
predominated in a subset of 27 patients (27%),
whereas improvement predominated in 28 patients

in a lower percentage of predominant deterioration

Neither declines nor improvements were related
significantly to the number of test results in the
lower 5% range at T1. However, the number of test
results in the upper 5% range at T1 was correlated
positively with declines and negatively with further

further. Age and intelligence were not associated significantly with the number of deteriorated and improved test results.

had performed very well at T1 and still performed
well at T2 (3 and 2 test results in the upper 5%
range, respectively; no test results in the lower 5%
range), suggesting regression to the mean.
Both measures of subjective cognitive function
showed a significant increase in cognitive problems
at T2 (FEDA: P < .001; EORTC Cognitive Function
Scale: P < .001). Correlations with the number of
deteriorated test results were small and nonsignificant (FEDA: Spearman q ¼ 0.13; P ¼ .20; EORTCCognitive Function Scale: Spearman q ¼ 0.11; P ¼
.30). In addition, changes in self-reported cognitive
problems were not associated significantly with the
number of deteriorated test results.
Anxiety and depression were not correlated significantly with the number of deteriorated or improved test results, whereas all correlations of anxiety
and depression with self-reported cognitive complaints
were significant and of moderate size (eg, HADS-A
and FEDA: Spearman q ¼ 0.41; P < .001; HADS-D and
FEDA: Spearman q ¼ 0.58; P < .001).

was indeterminable, and 3 patients had terminated
participation in the study. MANOVA with age and
intelligence as covariates did not identify any significant effect of therapy-induced menopause (interaction time*induced menopause: P ¼ .29; h2p ¼ 0.16).
There were no differences between patients who
received (n ¼ 51 patients) or did not receive (n ¼ 50
patients) concomitant darbepoetin a therapy with
regard to age, intelligence, or education. MANOVA
did not identify any significant influence of darbepoetin a on changes in cognitive performance (interaction of time*darbepoetin a: P ¼ .78; h2p ¼ 0.09).

DISCUSSION
Even before the start of chemotherapy, the performances of the patients—who had above-average
educational and intelligence levels—ranged below
the test norms on 5 of 12 tests. Approximately onethird of patients showed cognitive compromise even
before treatment. This impairment rate is similar to
that reported after chemotherapy in cross-sectional

Cognitive Function During Chemotherapy/Hermelink et al.

studies. Prechemotherapy cognitive compromise has
also been observed in other studies.8,42,43
Toward the completion of chemotherapy, approximately a quarter of patients showed a decline,
whereas another quarter demonstrated improvement
of cognitive function. Practice effects were taken into
account. There was no consistent pattern of affected
cognitive domains.
Very few patients exhibited a pronounced cognitive
decline. All of them were either taking antidepressant
medication known to affect cognitive function or had
performed extraordinarily well at T1 and still had
above-average performance at T2, which may be interpreted as a regression to the mean.
The patients’ reports of cognitive problems increased during chemotherapy, and those problems
were not related significantly to cognitive test results
but, rather, to anxiety and depression. This observation is in accordance with the findings of virtually all
studies that have reported on the relations between
cognitive performance and cognitive complaints.3,5,7,18,44
Neither chemotherapy-induced menopause nor concomitant darbepoetin a administration had a significant influence on cognitive change.
The current study was limited by the absence of
a control group. Test norms were used to rate the
baseline test results, and cognitive performances during chemotherapy were compared only with the
patients’ own baseline performance. Practice effects
were estimated by using effects observed in normative samples that were matched imperfectly to our
patient group. One advantage of this study was the
homogeneity of treatment. In addition, the attrition
rate was very low, and we controlled for confounding
factors—even those that emerged after the start of
study participation, such as psychoactive medication
that commenced during chemotherapy.
Our findings cast some additional doubt on the
evidence for chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment. In cross-sectional studies that used test
norms1 or control groups consisting of healthy participants,4,6,13 cognitive compromise in the patients
may have originated before chemotherapy, like it did
in the current study. However, several cross-sectional
studies have used control groups consisting of
patients with breast cancer who were treated without chemotherapy. The results were mixed: Poorer
performances were reported among patients who
received chemotherapy,2,3,5,7 although others reported no differences16,17; the latter findings also
were supported by a meta-analysis.21
Two longitudinal studies that provided evidence
of chemotherapy effects on cognitive function were
limited by their rather small sample sizes (Wefel

1911

et al.: N ¼ 18 patients; Bender et al.: N ¼ 36 patients
at the T2 assessment). A recently published, largescale, longitudinal trial by Jenkins et al.18 did not
identify any significant differences in cognitive
changes between chemotherapy patients, nonchemotherapy patients, and healthy control individuals.
The patients were heterogeneous with regard to the
chemotherapy regimens administered, with most
patients having received only relatively low-dose
combined 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide treatment. The authors considered the regimen a possible reason why cognitive impairment did
not become apparent. However, in the current study,
all of our patients received quite high doses of chemotherapy that contained anthracycline and taxane,
and the rate of decline during chemotherapy still did
not exceed the rate of simultaneous improvement.
In contrast to Jenkins et al., we observed cognitive compromise before the start of chemotherapy.
This discrepancy between the findings may have
been caused by differences in the assessment points:
Whereas the baseline assessment took place several
weeks after surgery (mean, 41 days) in the study by
Jenkins et al., we already had assessed cognitive
function after diagnosis—ie, at a time that is known
as especially stressful. Cognitive compromise at this
particular time may indicate that the still unidentified factor affecting cognitive function before chemotherapy is related to stress-response symptoms. Without
necessarily coinciding with symptoms of depression,
stress-response symptoms may interfere with performance during cognitive testing.
Conceivably, persistent stress-response symptoms
also may have caused the cognitive compromise that
we observed during and after chemotherapy in several
studies. Posttraumatic symptoms have been identified
in subgroups of breast cancer patients even long after
the completion of treatment.45 There is some evidence
that posttraumatic stress disorder may be associated
with memory and concentration problems.46 Further
research is needed to determine whether the phenomenon of cognitive compromise associated with breast
cancer is dubbed chemo brain correctly or, instead,
should be renamed crisis brain.
The results from this study do not corroborate
the hypothesis that chemotherapy is the cause of
cognitive dysfunction in patients with breast cancer.
The possibility cannot be ruled out that the cognitive
deterioration evident in a subgroup of patients during chemotherapy is attributable to the side effects
of chemotherapy. However, in the light of the apparent cognitive compromise before chemotherapy and
improvements observed in a subgroup of patients
during chemotherapy, an alternative explanation

seems more plausible—namely, that as yet unidentified factors affect cognition in patients with breast
cancer even before chemotherapy and affect it further during chemotherapy in a subgroup of patients,
when another subgroup starts to recover.
