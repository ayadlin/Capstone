ABSTRACT
There is accumulating evidence that TrkA and its ligand Nerve Growth Factor
(NGF) are involved in cancer development. Staurosporine derivatives such as K252a
and lestaurtinib have been developed to block TrkA kinase signaling, but no clinical
trial has fully demonstrated their therapeutic efficacy. Therapeutic failures are likely
due to the existence of intrinsic signaling pathways in cancer cells that impede
or bypass the effects of TrkA tyrosine kinase inhibitors. To verify this hypothesis,
we combined different approaches including mass spectrometry proteomics, coimmunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays. We found that NGF treatment
induced CD44 binding to TrkA at the plasma membrane and subsequent activation
of the p115RhoGEF/RhoA/ROCK1 pathway to stimulate breast cancer cell invasion.
The NGF-induced CD44 signaling was independent of TrkA kinase activity. Moreover,
both TrkA tyrosine kinase inhibition with lestaurtinib and CD44 silencing with siRNA
inhibited cell growth in vitro as well as tumor development in mouse xenograft
model; combined treatment significantly enhanced the antineoplastic effects of either
treatment alone. Altogether, our results demonstrate that NGF-induced tyrosine
kinase independent TrkA signaling through CD44 was sufficient to maintain tumor
aggressiveness. Our findings provide an alternative mechanism of cancer resistance
to lestaurtinib and indicate that dual inhibition of CD44 and TrkA tyrosine kinase
activity may represent a novel therapeutic strategy.

functions in both normal tissues and cancers of different
origins [2]. In particular, NGF is produced and released
by breast cancer and tumor-associated stromal cells. Its
expression is known to drive angiogenesis [3] and to
be responsible for bone metastasis pain [4]. TrkA, the

membrane receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) of NGF, plays
an important role in NGF-mediated biological effects. TrkA
expression is associated with perineural invasion of cancer
cells [5]. Mounting evidence suggests that NGF not only
affects tumor-associated cells but also dictates cancer cell
behaviors [6]. Interestingly, in breast cancer cells, TrkA
activation is correlated with the high pro-invasive and
metastatic potential [7–9] that is associated with poor clinical
outcomes [10, 11]. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors derived from
staurosporine (K252a, lestaurtinib) are reported to exert
antitumor effects in both in vitro and preclinical in vivo
models [12]. Nevertheless, TrkA kinase inhibitors failed to
demonstrate therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials [13]. The
lack of objective responses to TrkA inhibitors in clinical trials
has been linked to insufficient bioavailability of the drugs
[14] and more recently, to an intrinsic resistance mechanism
in cancer cells involving NF-kappa B signaling [15].
Interestingly, tyrosine kinase inhibitor effects may be also due
to interactions with other membrane receptors as exemplified
by the interaction of numerous RTKs with CD44 [16]. CD44
is a cell surface glycoprotein encoded by a single 20-exons
gene that generates a standard form (CD44s) and more than
twenty variant isoforms (CD44v) [17]. CD44 is also known
as a marker of cancer stem cells [18] and its expression may
cause therapeutic failure in many cancers [19].
In this report, we demonstrate for the first time that
NGF induces TrkA/CD44 interaction independent of TrkA
phosphorylation in cancer cells. The subsequent CD44
downstream signaling is implicated in cancer cell invasion
and growth. Altogether, our findings provide an alternative
mechanism of cancer resistance to lestaurtinib and indicate
that dual inhibition of CD44 and TrkA tyrosine kinase
activity may represent a novel therapeutic strategy.

LIMA1 (LIM domain and actin-binding protein 1)
(Table 1). We then performed biotin labeling and
streptavidin pull-down to analyze NGF-induced potential
modifications of membrane associated proteins. Several
bands of increased intensity upon NGF stimulation were
observed (Supplementary Figure S1) and processed for
mass spectrometry analysis. The following proteins were
identified: RhoA (Transforming protein RhoA), RhoC (Rhorelated GTP-binding protein C), Guanine nucleotide-binding
protein subunit alpha-13, Arp2 (Actin-related protein 2),
R-Ras2 (Ras-related protein 2), Basigin (CD147) and Actin 2
(Actin cytoplasmic 2) (Table 1). There is increasing evidence
that CD44 is involved in cancer development [19], but it has
not been reported to interact with TrkA or participate in its
downstream signaling. To validate the interaction between
TrkA and CD44, we performed IP and reverse IP, using HA
and CD44 antibodies, respectively (Figure 1A and 1B). TrkA
and CD44 were co-immunoprecipitated (co-IP) in NGFuntreated control cells, and the co-IP was further increased
upon NGF treatment. We then performed a proximity ligation
assay (PLA) to determine any direct interaction between
CD44 and TrkA at the plasma membrane (Figure 1C). In the
absence of NGF, a clear PLA signal (red dots) was observed
indicating that even without stimulation TrkA binds CD44.
When cells were treated with NGF for 5 min, a 3-fold
increase in the TrkA/CD44 complexes was observed at the
plasma membrane. This increase was transient as the PLA
signal decreased to basal level after 30 min of NGF treatment.
The observed kinetics of CD44/TrkA association might be
due to TrkA shuttling as PLA experiments were performed
without membrane permeabilization. Indeed, flow cytometry
analysis showed that membrane TrkA was not significantly
altered after 5 min of NGF treatment, but was reduced after
30 min (about 25%), indicating that TrkA may be internalized
(Figure 1D). Membrane CD44 was also increased (27%) after
5 min of NGF treatment but decreased under basal levels
after 30 min (−17%) (Figure 1E). TrkA/CD44 association
was also tested in cell lines from breast, prostate, colon, head
and neck cancers (Supplementary Figure S2) although total
expression levels of CD44 and TrkA varied between the cell
lines (Supplementary Figure S2A). In PC3 prostate cancer
cells, which express relatively high levels of both CD44
and TrkA, NGF stimulation resulted in the association of
TrkA with CD44 at the plasma membrane, as demonstrated
using the PLA signal of TrkA/CD44 (Supplementary Figure
S2B). Altogether, these results indicate that NGF induces
association between TrkA and CD44 at the plasma membrane
in cancer cells of various origins.

RESULTS
CD44 association with TrkA at the plasma
membrane is enhanced by NGF stimulation
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells overexpressing HATrkA were used to examine the signaling pathways involved
in NGF response as described previously [8]. Cells were
treated with NGF for 30 min, cell lysates were then subjected
to HA immunoprecipitation (IP) or streptavidin pull-down.
Eluates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized with
colloidal Coomassie Blue staining (Supplementary Figure
S1A) and classified with gene ontology (Supplementary
Figure S1B). Several bands of increased intensity were
detected in NGF-treated cells using IP corresponding to
proteins that may be specifically bound to TrkA. These bands
were excised for identification using mass spectrometry.
Among the proteins identified, we found CD44 and several
of its known signaling partners including Ezrin, Moesin,
p115RhoGEF (Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1),
FAK1 (Focal adhesion kinase 1), ARP2C (Actinrelated protein 2/3 complex subunit 2), Alpha-actinin-1,

we found that p115RhoGEF co-immunoprecipitated
with TrkA in NGF-treated cells (Table 1). To confirm the
downstream association of p115RhoGEF to the TrkA/
CD44 complex, we used co-IP to investigate whether
they directly interact. Indeed, antibodies against the
HA tag or CD44 were able to pull down p115RhoGEF
(Figure 2A and 2B). Moreover, upon NGF treatment,
ROCK1 (the main target of RhoA and RhoC) was also
found to co-IP with TrkA and CD44 (Figure 2C and 2D).
The involvement of p115RhoGEF and ROCK1 in NGFinduced signaling was further supported by the activation
of RhoA and RhoC, which are p115RhoGEF downstream
targets (Figure 2E). In order to ascertain that CD44 is
responsible of RhoGTPase activation, we measured RhoA
and RhoC activities after CD44 invalidation by siRNA. As
shown in Figure 2F, CD44 siRNA reduced RhoGTPAse
activities for both RhoA and RhoC. We also analyzed the
invasive capacity of breast cancer cells in vitro using a
transwell system (Figure 3A–3C). We found that inhibition
of CD44 and p115RhoGEF either through siRNA or
the ROCK1 specific inhibitor Y-27632 totally abolished
NGF-induced invasion Interestingly, blocking CD44
affected neither NGF-induced TrkA phosphorylation nor
the canonical TrkA pathways that signal through Akt and
Src (Supplementary Figure S3). Together, these results
indicate that the TrkA/CD44 complex induced by NGF
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

is able to activate the RhoGTPAse signaling pathway to
enhance cell invasion, independently of TrkA canonical
pathways.

TrkA/CD44 association is independent of NGFinduced TrkA phosphorylation
Our findings that blocking CD44 abolished NGFinduced cell invasion but did not affect NGF-induced TrkA
tyrosine kinase phosphorylation, prompted us to evaluate
whether the activation state of TrkA could affect the TrkA/
CD44 association at the plasma membrane. We performed
a PLA on cells treated with TrkA tyrosine kinase inhibitor
K252a or on cells expressing TrkA kinase-dead mutant to
inhibit TrkA phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure S4).
A 2-fold increase of PLA signal was observed at the
plasma membrane after 5 min of treatment with NGF,
the PLA signal intensity returned to basal levels after
30 min of treatment (Figure  4A). Similar results were
observed in both K252a-treated cells (Figure 4B) and cells
expressing TrkA kinase-dead mutant (Figure 4C) after 5
min of treatment with NGF. These results indicated that
the interaction between TrkA and CD44 is independent of
TrkA tyrosine kinase activity. However, after 30 min of
NGF treatment, TrkA/CD44 interaction did not return to
basal levels in K252a-treated (Figure 4B) and kinase-dead

of p115RhoGEF (A and B) and ROCK1 (C and D) in the eluate. (E) NGF increases RhoGTPase activity. HA-TrkA MDA-MB-231 cells

mutant (Figure 4C) cells compared to control (Figure 4A).
This could be due to suboptimal TrkA internalization as
it has been reported that phosphorylation of TrkA offers
docking sites for cellular endocytosis machinery [21].
To verify this possibility, we performed flow cytometry
analysis to evaluate the membrane levels of TrkA
(Figure 4D). Indeed, after 30 min of NGF treatment, no
diminution of TrkA levels was observed in cells treated
with K252a compared with DMSO-treated control cells,
indicating that inhibition of TrkA phosphorylation slowed
TrkA internalization. We then measured p115RhoGEF
binding to TrkA and RhoGTPase activation in TrkA
kinase dead mutant cells. As shown in Figure 4E and
4F, p115RhoGEF binding to TrkA was still enhanced
under NGF treatment (3.8 fold increase after 30 min of
NGF treatment) (Figure 4E). Moreover, in TrkA kinasewww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

dead cells, RhoA and RhoC were activated in absence
of NGF treatment and NGF further increased these
activities. Together, these results indicate that TrkA/CD44
association and the subsequent RhoGTPase activation are
not abolished by the inhibition of TrkA phosphorylation.
In contrast, the inhibition of TrkA phosphorylation seems
to maintain TrkA/CD44 complex.

Combinational targeting of TrkA and CD44
exhibits enhanced anti-tumor activity
As the formation of TrkA/CD44 complex was
independent of TrkA phosphorylation, and TrkA tyrosine
inhibitor K252a allowed for sustained TrkA and CD44

if combinational targeting of TrkA and CD44 could more

5A and 5B, K252a treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells
reduced both the size and the number of colonies. Blocking
CD44 by siRNA only slightly decreased colony formation.
Interestingly, combined treatment of cells with K252a and
siCD44 dramatically reduced clonogenic cell growth. We
next evaluated the efficiency of these treatments in vivo
by performing tumor xenograft experiments in the SCID
mouse model. As shown in Figure 5C and 5D, lestaurtinib
(clinical derivative of K252a) or siCD44 reduced tumor
growth when compared to control (scramble siRNA).
Combined treatment of lestaurtinib and siCD44 resulted
in a dramatic reduction of tumor burden when compared to
lestaurtinib or siCD44 treatment alone. We also confirmed

the direct interaction between TrkA and CD44 in tumor
xenografts using a PLA (Figure 5E).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we report for the first time that
TrkA is associated with CD44 in cancer cells. CD44 is
the principal receptor for the large glycosaminoglycan
hyaluronan. CD44 lacks kinase activity but influences
cell behaviors such as uncontrolled growth, apoptosis
evasion, angiogenesis, cell motility and invasion through
various mechanisms [22]. CD44 directly interacts with
key intracellular regulators of the actin cytoskeleton
such as ankyrin, and members of the ezrin, radixin, and

moesin (ERM) protein families. CD44 can also function
as a co-receptor to modulate signaling from a diverse set
of membrane receptors including integrins, multidrug
resistance complex components (MDR 1, CD147) and
growth factor receptors such as EGFR, PDGFR, FGFR,
and c-Met [19]. CD44 cooperates with RTKs through
different mechanisms. For instance, CD44 transactivates
the ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimer by Src-mediated
phosphorylation of ErbB2. CD44 can also initiate growth
factor receptor signaling by interacting with various
ligands. For instance, binding of proHBEGF to CD44v3
induces cleavage of the proform and release of HBEGF
that in turn activates ErbB4. CD44v also binds to HGF/
SF and FGF and presents them to their specific RTK [23].
A splice variant of CD44 expressed in the apical ectoderm
ridge presents FGFs to limb mesenchyme and is required
for limb outgrowth [24]. In our cell models, because CD44
is co-immunoprecipitated with TrkA and we observed a
positive signal from the PLA, a direct association between
TrkA and CD44 is suggested. Alternatively, NGF is known
to bind to heparan sulfate with low affinity [25], it is
possible that NGF serves as a bridge between TrkA and
CD44. Moreover, the formation of TrkA/CD44 complex
upon NGF stimulation leads to the activation of the
canonical CD44 pathway involving p115RhoGEF, RhoA
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and ROCK1 (Figure 6). TrkA and CD44 co-expression has
been already reported in neuroblastoma cells [26] but the
authors did not examine their interaction nor the resulting
intracellular signaling. TrkA signaling has been widely
described in nerve systems and similar signaling pathways
have also been found in cancer cells. Indeed, NGF binding
to TrkA induces phosphorylation of TrkA, phospho-TrkA
then recruits various intracellular adaptors (e.g. Shc,
Grb2, or PI3K) to activate MAPK or PI3K, resulting in
cell growth or differentiation depending on the cell type.
TrkA signaling is also modulated by several co-receptors
such as p75NTR, GPCR (G protein-coupled receptor), and
Ret-5. P75NTR is a low affinity receptor and is the first
described co-receptor of TrkA. After its binding to p75NTR,
NGF has an increased affinity for TrkA [27]. In addition,
p75NTR also delays TrkA ubiquitination and sustains its
phosphorylation [28]. However, we have previously shown
that p75NTR is not involved in NGF-stimulated invasion of
breast cancer cells [8]. Transactivation of TrkA receptors
in PC12 cells and TrkB in hippocampal neurons has
been observed after treatment with adenosine or PACAP
neuromodulators, both of which act through GPCRs [29].
Trk receptor transactivation by adenosine or PACAP
requires a longer time course. Furthermore, the increase
in Trk activity can be inhibited by the use of K252a, PP1

and Src family-specific inhibitors. Trk receptors also have
the capacity to activate the Ret-51 receptor tyrosine kinase
in postnatal superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons.
Ret-51 activation does not depend on the PI3K or MAPK
pathways and occurs with a very slow kinetics, similar to
GPCR activation of Trk receptors [30].
Receptor tyrosine kinases are widely activated in
cancers, and have been the focus of targeted therapies for
several decades. TrkA is a prototypical RTK and phosphoTrkA has been correlated with the tumor aggressiveness
in breast cancer [7]. We showed that in breast cancer cell
lines, the biological effects of TrkA are mainly supported
by its phosphorylation [8, 9]. Moreover, it has been found
that NTRK1 fusion or rearrangement that constitutively
activates TrkA by phosphorylation is oncogenic in lung
tissue [31]. Altogether, these data indicate the importance
of phospho-TrkA and its canonical signaling pathways
in tumor development and suggest that tyrosine kinase
inhibitors would be good candidates for cancer therapy.
Nevertheless, despite the powerful anti-tumor effect in
vitro and in vivo [32–34], therapeutic benefits of such
compounds have not been documented. In this report,
we show that the NGF/TrkA axis engages CD44 as a coreceptor to strengthen cancer cell invasion and growth.
This interaction is independent of the kinase activity of
TrkA. Our findings provide a rational for the development
of new therapeutics by simultaneously blocking both the
kinase dependent and independent effects of TrkA.

The MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line was
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC). MDA-MB-231 overexpressing HA-TrkA or
kinase-dead TrkA were established and maintained in
culture as previously described [8]. Cells were amplified
and passaged no more than 25 times. Before treatment,
cells were rinsed twice with PBS, left for 24 h in culture
medium supplemented with 0.1% fetal bovine serum
(FBS), then treated with recombinant human β-NGF
(denoted as NGF and used at a 16 nM concentration in
all experiments) (Scil Proteins, Germany). For some
experiments, cells were pre-incubated for 1 h with the
pharmacological inhibitors K252a (10 nM) or Y-27632 (10
μM) (Calbiochem, UK) before NGF treatment.

downstream CD44 signaling. Lestaurtinib inhibits the kinase activity of TrkA and phospho-TrkA-dependent downstream signaling

including Akt. However, a phospho-TrkA-independent pathway that uses CD44 signaling may serve as an alternative pathway to strengthen
tumor aggressiveness and to escape lestaurtinib inhibition.

0.5 mM MgCl2), and then incubated (30 min, 4°C) with
a membrane-impermeable EZ-Link-Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin
(1 mg/mL; Thermo Scientific, Belgium) to label membrane
proteins. Free biotin was quenched (0.1 M glycine, 30 min,
4°C) and washed twice with ice-cold biotinylation buffer.
Cells were then incubated in pre-warmed media at 37°C
with or without NGF. Cells were then incubated with 1 mM
Dithiobis Succinimidyl Propionate (Thermo Scientific)
dissolved in hybridization buffer (10 mM HEPES pH
7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM CaCl2 and 0.2 mM MgCl2)
(30 min, 4°C) and then neutralized (20 mM Tris-HCl pH
7.5 and 150 mM NaCl) (30 min, 4°C). This incubation was
followed by cell lysis and biotinylated proteins were then
isolated by immobilization on streptavidin agarose resins
(Thermo Scientific) (3 h, 4°C). Beads were washed three
times (lysis buffer, 4°C) and eluted in Laemmli buffer
(7 min, 95°C).

lysates were then cleared by centrifugation (6,000 g, 10
min, 4°C) and stored at −80°C until analysis. Supernatants
were collected and protein concentration was determined
using the BCA assay (Sigma-Aldrich).

Immunoprecipitation
Cell lysates were pre-cleared using matching
antibody isotype and protein-G agarose beads (50%
slurry in PBS, 1 h, 4°C). Cell lysates were then incubated
with primary antibodies (2 h, 4°C) and complexes were
precipitated with protein-G agarose beads (50% slurry
in PBS, 2 h, 4°C) and eluted in Laemmli 2X buffer.
Protein-G agarose beads were obtained from Millipore
(France) and antibody isotypes from R&D Systems
(France). The primary antibodies used in this study were:
anti-HA (Roche, France) and anti-CD44 (Cell Signaling
Technologies, Ozyme, France).

spectrometer (Q-Star, Applied Biosystems, France)
equipped with a nano-electrospray ion source coupled with
a nano high pressure liquid chromatography system (LC
Packings Dionex, France) as previously described [35].

Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, lysed
in 50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1%
Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT, supplemented with protease
inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Cell lysates were prepared as
described above. RhoA-GTP or RhoC-GTP levels were
quantified as described previously [36].

Western blot
Whole cell lysates or immunoprecipitated proteins
were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and
transferred to PVDF membranes (Westran® Clear
Signal). The membranes were blocked with 5% milk or
bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBS-0.1% Tween20
(TBS-T) and subsequently immunoblotted overnight at
4°C. The membranes were then probed with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson
Immunoresearch, Beckman Coulter, France) followed
by SuperSignal West Pico Substrate (Thermo Scientific).
Chemiluminescence was detected with a Fuji LAS-4000
luminescent image analyzer. The antibodies used in this
study were as follows: anti-actin (Sigma-Aldrich), antiHA (Covance, Eurogentec, France), anti-pan-CD44,
anti-phosphoTrkA (Tyr-674/675), anti-p115-RhoGEF,
anti-ROCK1, anti-RhoA, anti-RhoC, anti-phosphoAkt
(Ser-473), and anti-pan-Akt (Cell Signaling Technologies).

Cell invasion
Invasion assays were performed as previously
described [8] in Boyden microchambers (BD Biosciences)
with 8 μm pore size membranes.

Clonogenic cell growth
Clonogenic assays were performed as previously
described [37]. After siRNA transfection, 2,000 cells were
seeded in 35 mm petri dishes. Colonies were stained with
crystal violet [35] and colonies of at least 50 cells were
counted after one week of culture.

Tumor xenograft growth in immunodeficient
mice

Flow cytometry analysis of plasma membrane
level TrkA and CD44

HA-TrkA MDA-MB-231 cells (3 x 106) were
subcutaneously injected into six-week old female
SCID mice. Two weeks after cancer cells injection,
mice were randomized into treatment groups (n = 7),
and were treated a total of three times at 3 day
intervals. Lestaurtinib (Calbiochem) was suspended
in vehicle (40% polyethylene glycol 1000, 10%
povidone C30 and 2% benzyl alcohol in distilled
water) and injected intraperitoneally. CD44 siRNA
(7.5 μg/mouse) or scramble siRNA (7.5 μg/mouse)
were delivered using in vivo jetPEI® according to the
manufacturer's instructions (Polyplus transfection) and
injected subcutaneously near the tumor mass. Tumor
volume was determined throughout the experiment by
measuring the length (l) and width (w) and calculated
as π/6 x l x w x (l + w)/2.

Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then
incubated with isotype antibody-FITC (BD Biosciences),
anti-TrkA antibody (Abcam), or anti-CD44-FITC antibody
(BD Biosciences), (1 μg in 1% SVF, 30 min, 4°C). Levels
of TrkA and CD44 were analyzed using flow cytometry
and Summit 4.5 software (Beckmann Coulter, France).

In situ proximity ligation assay (PLA)
Cells (104 cells per well) were grown on acidwashed eight-well glass slides (Thermo Scientific)
in EMEM plus 10% FBS for 24 h. After treatment,
paraformaldehyde-fixed cells were incubated with 4%
BSA (1 h, 20°C) followed by overnight incubation with
primary antibodies [rabbit anti-HA, 1:50, (Sigma); rabbit
anti-TrkA, 1:50, (Alomone, Israel); mouse anti-CD44,
1:200, (Cell Signaling Technology)]. PLA was performed
as recommended by manufacturer instructions.

Statistical analysis
Statistics were performed with GraphPad Prism
5.01 software. Quantitative variables were analyzed by
one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post-test (p < 0.001).
Data from the in vivo experiment were analyzed using the
Mann-Whitney test.

siRNA
The siRNA sequences used (100 pmol
for
each
transfection)
were
against
CD44
(GUAUGACACAUAUUGCUUC) and p115RhoGEF
(GCAGCUCUGAGAACGGCAA) (Eurogentec, France).
siCTRL (scramble siRNA) were from Life technologies.
siRNA transfection was performed using INTERFERinTM
according to the manufacturer's instructions (Polyplus
transfection, Ozyme, France).
