ABSTRACT
Reversing drug resistance with concurrent treatment confers anticancer
benefits. In this study, we investigated the potential mechanism of glucosylceramide
synthase (GCS)-mediated vinca alkaloid vinorelbine (VNR) resistance in human lung
adenocarcinoma cells. Compared with PC14PE6/AS2 (AS2) and CL1-0 cells, apoptotic
analysis showed that both A549 and CL1-5 cells were VNR-resistant, while these
cells highly expressed GCS at the protein level. VNR treatment significantly converts
ceramide to glucosylceramide in VNR-resistant cells; however, pharmacologically
inhibiting GCS with (±)-threo-1-Phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol
hydrochloride (PDMP) induced ceramide accumulation, accompanied by a decrease
in glucosylceramide. Under concurrent treatment with VNR and PDMP, an increase in
cell apoptosis could be identified; furthermore, genetically silencing GCS confirmed
these effects. In VNR-resistant cells, Bcl-xL expression was aberrantly increased,
while pharmacologically inhibiting Bcl-xL with ABT-737 sensitized cells to VNRinduced apoptosis. Conversely, enforced expression of Bcl-xL strengthened the
survival response of the VNR-susceptible cells AS2 and CL1-0. Without changes in
mRNA expression, Bcl-xL was overexpressed independent of β-catenin-mediated
transcriptional regulation in VNR-resistant cells. Simultaneous GCS inhibition and
VNR treatment caused a decrease in Bcl-xL expression. According to these findings,
an increase in GCS caused Bcl-xL augmentation, facilitating VNR resistance in lung
adenocarcinoma cells.

INTRODUCTION

the tumors, and tumor vasculature [1-7]. Cells generate
ceramide in response to stresses such as chemotherapy,
causing proliferation arrest, apoptosis, or autophagy
[8]. However, cancer cells eliminate ceramide through
ceramide glycosylation to escape death, and persistently
promoting ceramide glycosylation can select cancer cells
for drug resistance [9-12].
Multiple drug-resistant (MDR) cancers have
elevated glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) and
P-glycoprotein, and GCS promoter activity is 15-fold
higher in MCF-7-AdrR cells than in MCF-7 cells [13].

Lung cancer currently remains a major cause
of cancer deaths worldwide. The prognosis of lung
cancer is poor, and resistance to chemotherapy is the
greatest obstacle to effective cancer treatment. There are
numerous mechanisms related to drug resistance in lung
cancers, including ineffective drug delivery to the tumors,
increased drug efflux, DNA repair, drug inactivation, the
interference of target enzymes, the shortened half-lives
of drugs, apoptosis defects, lack of drug specificity to

Attenuating GCS expression and/or activity with inhibitors
or oligonucleotides selectively reverses drug resistance in
cancer cells [14, 15]. GCS up-regulates MDR1 mRNA
expression for cancer drug resistance through c-Src and
β-catenin [16]. Leukemia cells with GCS overexpression
also show increased levels of MDR1 and Bcl-2
expression, as well as a poor response to chemotherapy
[17]. Vinorelbine (VNR) is initially developed in 1979,
and is a semi-synthetic second generation vinca-alkaloid
[18]. VNR binds to tubulin as a potent inhibitor of
mitotic microtubule polymerization in chemotherapy,
and causes aberrant ROS-mediated JNK activation,
Mcl-1 downregulation, DNA damage, mitochondrial
dysfunction, and apoptosis in lung adenocarcinoma cells
[25]. Further phase III studies demonstrate the application
of vinorelbine in excellent combination with platinum in
lung cancer patients [19-21]. It has been used both as a
single agent and in combination with cisplatin for firstline treatment of advanced and metastatic non-small cell
lung cancer [19, 22-24]; however, tumors also develop
resistance in response to VNR treatment. The possible
relationship between VNR resistance and GCS expression
has not been explored.
The Bcl-2 family proteins, including proapoptotic proteins (Bax, BAD, Bak, BIM, BID, …etc.)
and anti-apoptotic proteins (including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL,
Mcl-1, …etc.), control mitochondrial outer membrane
permeabilization [25]. Bcl-2 down-regulation was found to
be a mechanism of paclitaxel resistance [26]. Expression
of Bcl-xL in several cancer cells could induce MDR [27].
In gastric cancers, MDR-1 behaves as an oncofetal protein
and had anti-apoptotic action through cross-talk with BclxL [28]. Basically, MDR-1, Bcl-xL, H. pylori, and Wnt/βcatenin signaling contribute to gastric carcinogenesis [29].
β-catenin-transduced regulatory T cells showed decreases
in c-myc and Bax but an increase in Bcl-xL [30]. In this
study, we further examined a possible mechanism by
which high expression of GCS induced Bcl-xL-mediated
anti-apoptosis in VNR-resistant lung cancer cells.

staining (Figure 1B) and annexin V/PI staining (Figure
1C), followed by flow cytometry, all revealed that VNR
significantly (P < 0.05) induced more apoptosis in AS2
and CL1-0 cells than in A549 and CL1-5 cells. Western
blot analysis showed that A549 and CL1-5 cells had
higher GCS expression than AS2 and CL1-0 cells (Figure
1D). However, RT-PCR assays showed that there was no
difference in the mRNA expression of GCS in AS2 and
A549 cells (Figure 1E). These results demonstrated that
high GCS expression in lung cancer cells resistant to
VNR and GCS expression was not regulated by mRNA
transcription.

RESULTS

Inhibition of GCS causes significant apoptosis in
high GCS expressing cancer cells

High GCS is expressed in lung cancer cells
resistant to VNR

Because A549 and CL1-5 cells were resistant to
VNR, we next examined the role of GCS in our model.
Blocking GCS plus VNR facilitated more apoptosis than
VNR alone in A549 and CL1-5 cells (P < 0.01) (Figure
3A). We knocked down GCS with siRNA (Figure 3B,
upper), and VNR plus GCS knockdown induced more
apoptosis than VNR alone in A549 cells (P < 0.05) (Figure
3B, lower). The generation of ceramide (Figure 3C,
upper) and glucosylceramide (Figure 3C, lower) in VNRtreated A549 cells with or without GCS knockdown were
confirmed as similar to the results of PDMP treatment.
These results demonstrated that GCS played an important
role in the VNR resistance mechanism.

Blockage of GCS induces ceramide accumulation
with decreased glucosylceramide
Ceramide immunostaining, followed by flow
cytometry, showed that VNR treatment caused a
significant increase in AS2 but not A549 cells. Inhibiting
GCS with PDMP all significantly (P < 0.05) induced
ceramide expression in A549 and AS2 cells, compared
to VNR treatment only (Figure 2A). We also investigated
the levels of glucosylceramide because the sphingolipid
metabolites are typically regulated during ceramide
expression. Ceramide levels are tightly regulated
through different pathways including de novo synthesis,
hydrolysis of sphingomyelin, and decreasing ceramide
metabolism. In the metabolic pathway, ceramide converts
to glucosylceramide, sphingosine-1-phosphate, and
ceramide-1-phosphate by glucosylceramide synthase,
ceramidase, and ceramide kinase, respectively [8, 32]. A
significant increased generation of glucosylceramide was
found in VNR-treated A549 cells, as compared to AS2
cells. Furthermore, PDMP decreased glucosylceramide
generation in VNR-treated A549 and AS2 cells, compared
to VNR treatment alone (P < 0.05) (Figure 2B). These
results demonstrate that inhibiting GCS caused ceramide
generation, followed by decreased glucosylceramide.

VNR works as an anticancer agent by inducing
cell growth inhibition and cell apoptosis. In our previous
study, A549 cells were much less susceptible to VNRinduced apoptosis than AS2 cells [31]. We examined the
cytotoxic effects of VNR using fluorescence microscopy.
These analyses showed that VNR treatment caused
shrinkage of A549 and AS2 cells (Figure 1A), and DAPI
staining confirmed the presence of apoptotic cells with
DNA condensation in VNR-treated cells. Nuclear PI

< 0.05) (Figure 4C). Overexpression of Bcl-xL resulted
in more resistance to VNR in AS2 (P < 0.05) (Figure 5A)
and CL1-0 lung cancer cells (P < 0.05) (Figure 5B). These
results demonstrated that expression of Bcl-xL played an
important role in modulating the response of VNR.

The Bcl-2 family of proteins includes both proand anti-apoptotic molecules, so we next examined
the expression of these proteins in lung cancer cells.
Western blot analysis showed that expression of Bcl-xL
was lower in AS2 and CL1-0 lung cancer cells than in
A549 and CL1-5 cells (Figure 4A). The Bcl-xL level in
AS2 and A549 lung cancer cells decreased gradually 48
h after VNR was treated (Figure 4B). Nuclear PI staining,
followed by flow cytometry, revealed that inhibiting BclxL with Abt737 plus VNR contributed to more apoptosis
in A549 and CL1-5 lung cancer cells than VNR alone (P

β-catenin increased in A549 cells independent of
Bcl-xL
RT-PCR assays showed that there was no difference
in the mRNA expression of Bcl-xL between AS2 and A549
cells (Figure 6A). Previous publications have shown that
β-catenin enhanced the expression of Bcl-xL [30], so we
next examined the relationship between these molecules.

DISCUSSION

There was higher expression of β-catenin in A549 cells
than in AS2 cells by western blot analysis (Figure 6B).
Pharmacologically inhibiting β-catenin with PNU74654
did not affect the Bcl-xL level (Figure 6C) or apoptosis
(Figure 6D). These results demonstrated that β-catenin
was not essential for Bcl-xL to increase in A549 cells.

As summarized in Figure 7E, this study
demonstrated a VNR-resistant strategy in lung
adenocarcinoma cells, by which an increase GCS
expression caused anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL up-regulation
to facilitate cancer cell survival in response to VNR
treatment. While this study explored why lung cancer
cells overexpressed GCS, it remains unclear how cancer
cells acquire GCS overexpression. Without changes in
the level of mRNA, a post-modification for GCS upregulation is speculated. Furthermore, in a future study,
an in vivo model is needed to confirm the combined
chemotherapeutic effects of VNR and GCS inhibition on
GCS-overexpressing lung cancers.
GCS overexpression was found in breast cancers
with metastasis but not in benign fibroadenomas or
primary tumors [33]. We theorized that different GCSexpressing lung cancer would have variable responses to
chemotherapy. Recently, more publications have reported
MDR cancers having increased GCS mRNA, protein, and
P-glycoprotein [13]. In the future, inhibiting GCS could be

Inhibiting GCS decreases the expression of BclxL.
To explore the relationship between GCS and BclxL, blocking GCS with PDMP caused decreased Bcl-xL
levels in A549 cells (Figure 7A), and GCS knockdown
also diminished the expression of Bcl-xL (Figure 7B).
Furthermore, CM-H2DCFDA staining, followed by
flow cytometric analysis, demonstrated that VNR plus
PDMP (Figure 7C) or ABT-737 (Figure 7D) significantly
increased the generation of intracellular ROS, both in
A549 (P < 0.05) and in AS2 (P < 0.01) cells. These results
demonstrated that GCS could modulate Bcl-xL expression.

an important target for patients with VNR-resistant lung
cancer. Gaucher disease type 1 would be expected to be
treated with Cerdelga (eliglustat) in the future. Cerdelga
is an orally administered GCS inhibitor that reduces
the production of glucosylceramide. The symptoms
of Gaucher disease are caused by the accumulation of
glucosylceramide in cells and tissues, leading to abnormal
blood counts, an enlarged liver or spleen, and destructive
bone disease. A new drug application filing was based on
the data from two completed phase III trials: ENGAGE
and ENCORE [34]. We expect to observe cytotoxic
effects with new GCS inhibitors, facilitating the use of
different chemotherapeutic agents in drug-resistant cancer
cell lines. Our results also demonstrated that PDMP and
GCS siRNA induced different levels of cell apoptosis. It
was surmised that PDMP may induce off-target effects
and the selection of cells with GCS silence may cause
cells gain of survival. For patients with MDR cancers,
chemotherapeutic agents combined with drugs inhibiting

GCS should be investigated in our future work.
Our previous study demonstrated that concurrent
chemoradiotherapy induced an increase in ceramide,
accompanied by a decrease in glucosylceramide that
was positively correlated with the cytotoxic effects [24].
In A549 cells with high GCS expression, VNR caused
low ceramide accumulation, following by elevated
glucosylceramide. Thus, inhibiting GCS induced
more cell death in high GCS-expressing lung cancer
cells, and the major cytotoxic effects were caused by
ceramide accumulation. However, no publications thus
far have investigated how high GCS-expressing cancer
cells resisted chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. To our
knowledge, our study was the first research to explore the
relationships among GCS, Bcl-xL, and VNR susceptibility.
We analyzed the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins
Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 in different lung cancer cells,
and high GCS-expressing cancer cells also showed
markedly increased Bcl-xL expression. VNR was treated

using A549 and AS2 cells, but Bcl-xL expression did not
show a dominant change until GCS was inhibited.
Inhibiting Bcl-xL induced more apoptosis in high
GCS-expressing cancer cells. We hypothesized that BclxL would be the key point in determining VNR resistance
in high GCS-expressing cancer cells. Overexpression of
Bcl-xL was designed to prove its anti-apoptotic role in low
GCS-expressing cancer cells. Our results demonstrated
that overexpressed Bcl-xL could induce a poor response
to VNR. GCS caused VNR resistance through the antiapoptotic effects of Bcl-xL. However, lung cancer cells
had different Bcl-xL levels but not due to transcription.
It was surmised that a less Bcl-xL in CL1-5 cells may
increase the cellular sensitivity to ABT-737 treatment.
Bcl-xL post-transcriptional modification or degradation
might affect VNR resistance. Keap1 degrades Bcl-xL via
phosphoglycerate mutase 5 [35], but it was not involved in
our model (data not shown). Post-modification of Bcl-xL
for its protein stability remains to be investigated in VNR-

sensitive and -insensitive lung cancer cells.
Because GCS up-regulates MDR1 expression
for cancer drug resistance through cSrc and β-catenin
[16], we hypothesized that Src and β-catenin might
be the target points. In addition, Ding et al. found that
β-catenin–transduced Treg cells showed enhanced BclxL expression [30]. We designed this study to explore the
relationships among Src, β-catenin, and Bcl-xL. However,
inhibiting β-catenin did not reduce the expression of
Bcl-xL, indicating an independent role for β-catenin in
the Bcl-xL increase in our model. However, inhibiting
Src plus VNR could result in more apoptosis than VNR
alone (Figure S1). We believe that Src plays some role
in VNR resistance. Blocking GCS through inhibition or
knockdown of PDMP could result in decreased Bcl-xL
expression, demonstrating that GCS contributed to BclxL-mediated cell survival in VNR-resistant lung cancer
cells.

for 2 min, and 72°C for 3 min) using a PCR controller
(GeneAmp PCR System 2400; PerkinElmer, Wellesley,
MA, USA). The PCR products were separated by 1.5%
agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium
bromide, and viewed with UV light. The relative OD of
signal protein was quantified using ImageJ software.

cells were cultured for 24 h prior to the experiments.

Intracellular ROS assay
Intracellular oxidative stress was measured by
dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate oxidation. Cells
were exposed to 20 µM 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2’,7’dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester (CMH2DCFDA) (Invitrogen) for 1 h. The cells were detected
with the FL-1 channel (515-545 nm) by FACSCalibur.
The data was analyzed analyzed using CellQuest Pro 4.0.2
software, and quantification was done using WinMDI 2.8
software. Small cell debris was excluded by gating on a
forward scatter plot.

Statistical analysis
The values are provided as the means ± standard
deviations (SDs). The groups were compared using
Student’s two-tailed unpaired t test; significance was set
at a P-value of < 0.05.

Immunostaining

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

To detect the expression of sphingolipid metabolites,
we fixed, stained, and analyzed the cells. Briefly, the cells
were fixed and permeabilized with 3.7 % formaldehyde
in PBS. After the cells were washed and stained with
primary antibody followed by an Alexa 488-conjugated
secondary antibody, the cells were analyzed using flow
cytometry (FACSCalibur). The samples were analyzed
using CellQuest Pro 4.0.2 software, and quantification
was performed using WinMDI 2.8 software. The mean
fluorescence intensity of each stain, compared with the
normalized values of untreated cells (fold increase), is
shown.
