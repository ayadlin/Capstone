ABSTRACT
Control of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with brain metastasis is clinically
challenging. This study retrospectively evaluated the efficacy of different adjuvant
therapies for 776 cases of advanced NSCLCs with brain metastasis who treated with
chemotherapy, chemotherapy plus bevacizumab, tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) alone,
or supportive care. The median progression-free survival (mPFS) and median overall
survival (mOS) of patients treated with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab were 8.5 and
10.5 months, respectively, which were better than those of patients treated with other
three therapies(P < 0.01). For patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC, the efficacy of TKI
treatment was not statistically better than that of chemotherapy plus bevacizumab
but was significantly better than that of other therapies. Moreover, for patients with
EGFR wild-type NSCLC, the mPFS and mOS after chemotherapy plus bevacizumab
were greater than those with other two therapies (P < 0.01). The local response
rate (RR)and disease control rate (DCR)with regimen including pemetrexed were
greater than those with regimen including paclitaxel (P < 0.05). Chemotherapy plus
bevacizumab was more effective for NSCLC patients with brain metastasis. Further
studies will investigate the benefit of TKI alone for patients with EGFR-mutated. For
patients with EGFR wild-type, chemotherapy plus bevacizumab did improve PFS and
OS. Furthermore, regimens including pemetrexed led to a greater RR.

INTRODUCTION

intensity modulation radiated therapy (IMRT) [6–9]. For
patients with multiple cerebral lesions, the prognosis is
still poor; the median overall survival (mOS) was reported
to be only 4–6 months after radiotherapy [10, 11] or only
approximately 1 month without treatment. Furthermore,
the quality of life of these patients is also very poor [5].
Thus, more effective treatment regimens or strategies to
control NSCLC with brain metastasis are urgently needed.
To date, the best optimal chemotherapy regimens
for NSCLC patients with brain metastases are still
deba Table  and sometimes are controversial, although
platinum compounds are still basically the first-line
NSCLC chemotherapy in the clinic. Recent studies
showed the effectiveness of pemetrexed treatment in
NSCLC patients with brain metastasis [12–14], and
molecular targeted drugs have offered new hope to these
patients [15]. Bevacizumab, the most widely used drug in

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related
deaths in the world [1] and non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% of all lung
cancer cases [1]. NSCLC is usually diagnosed at the
advanced stages of disease, and brain metastasis is a
common complication in NSCLC patients, with more
than 10% of NSCLC patients presenting with brain
metastases at their first hospital visit [2, 3] and 30%–40%
of NSCLC patients developing brain metastasis during the
course of the disease [4]. The standard treatment protocol
for patients with multiple metastases is whole brain
radiotherapy (WBRT) [5] and steriotactic radiosurgery
(SRS) used to treat solitary or oligo-metastatic disease that
contains the following techniques: gamma knife, threedimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT), and/or

anti-angiogenic therapy, has also been shown to improve
response rates, progression-free survival (PFS), and OS
compared to chemotherapy alone [16–18]. However, with
the fear of tumor-related intracranial hemorrhage (ICH)
[19], the use of bevacizumab to treat NSCLC patients
has remained fairly rare, except in one study reported
by Socinskiet al. [15] who suggested that addition
of bevacizumab to various chemotherapy regimens
or erlotinib for treating NSCLC patients with brain
metastases is safe. However, the efficacy of this strategy
remains to be confirmed. For NSCLC patients, targeted
therapy is progressing rapidly [20–30]. One example is
the targeting of mutations of epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR). Several randomized, open-label, phase
III clinical trials have compared tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs) with the routine chemotherapy, and the data
suggest that the response rate (RR) and PFS of patients
with EGFR-mutated NSCLC who receive EGFR-TKIs as
a first-line treatment are significantly greater than those
of patients who receive chemotherapy, although the OS
did not differ significantly between these two treatments
[20–30]. In addition, NSCLC patients with brain
metastasis were excluded from these studies [20–30].
Patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC do not usually
receive TKI treatment in China due to economic or other
reasons. Thus, in this study, we compared the effectiveness
of different treatment regimens in NSCLC patients with
brain metastasis using a retrospective setting to provide
valuable information for future clinical treatment of
NSCLC patients with brain metastasis.

TKIs alone, and supportive care were 5.0 months (95% CI:
4.7–5.2 months), 8.5 months (95% CI:7.7–9.3 months),
8.0 months (95% CI:6.8–9.1 months), and 1.5 months
(95% CI:1.3–1.6 months), respectively. The mPFS after
chemotherapy plus bevacizumab was significantly greater
than those of the other three treatment groups (P < 0.05),
including even the TKI treatment group (P = 0.024).
The mOS of all 776 patients was 7.7 months
(95% CI:7.4–7.9 months), and the mOS times after
chemotherapy alone, chemotherapy plus bevacizumab,
TKIs alone, and supportive care were 7.3 (95% CI:6.9–­7.6),
10.5 (95% CI:9.7–11.3), 10.3 (95% CI:9.0–11.5),
and 3.0 months (95% CI:2.8–3.2 months), respectively.
The mOS after chemotherapy plus bevacizumab was
significantly greater than that after chemotherapy alone
and after supportive care (P < 0.01), but not statistically
different from that with the TKI treatment (P = 0.836).

Association of different treatments with survival
of patients with EGFR mutated NSCLC
PFS and OS data for the 416 patients with
EGFR mutated NSCLC were stratified by the different
treatments for analysis with Kaplan–Meier curves
and the log-rank test (Figure  2). Specifically, the
mPFS of these 416 patients was 6.5 months (95%
CI: 6.1–6.8 months), whereas the mPFS times after
chemotherapy alone, chemotherapy plus bevacizumab,
TKIs alone, and supportive care were 6.0 (95% CI:
5.6–6.3), 7.5 (95% CI:6.8–8.2), 8.0 (95% CI:6.8–9.1),
and 1.0 month(s) (95% CI:0.8–1.2), respectively. The
mPFS after TKI treatment alone was significantly greater
than that after chemotherapy alone and after supportive
care (P < 0.01), but not statistically different from that
after chemotherapy plus bevacizumab (P = 0.411).
The mOS of these 416 patients was 8.3 months
(95% CI:7.9–8.7), whereas the mOS after chemotherapy
alone, chemotherapy plus bevacizumab, TKIs alone,
and supportive care was 7.7 (95% CI:7.3–8.0), 9.3 (95%
CI: 8.5–10.1), 10.3 (95% CI:9.0–11.5), and 2.9 months
(95% CI:2.6–3.1 months), respectively. The mOS after
TKI treatment alone was significantly greater than that
after chemotherapy alone and after supportive care
(P < 0.01), but was not statistically different from that
after chemotherapy plus bevacizumab (P = 0.130).

RESULTS
Patient characteristics
For the 776 patients included in this study, the median
age was 58 years;423 were male and 353 female. All
patients had brain metastasis and 37% also had pulmonary
metastasis, 24% had ossary metastasis, and 7% had hepatic
metastasis. These patients were treated with chemotherapy
alone, chemotherapy plus bevacizumab, TKIs alone, or
supportive care. However, all patients, except 61 who
received only supportive care, had received concurrent
radiotherapy (WBRT or SRS). The characteristics of these
patients are shown in Table 1, and no significant differences
were observed between the four treatment groups.

DISCUSSION

Among the total of 776 patients, 622 patients
were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. We assessed
the treatment responses for different cytotoxic drugs as
the first-line treatment (Table 2). Among patients who
received a pemetrexed regimen (n  =  278) oral taxane

In the current study, we assessed the effectiveness
of different therapeutic regimens on PFS and OS of 776
NSCLC patients with brain metastasis. We found that

chemotherapy plus bevacizumab resulted in an mPFS of
8.5 months and an mOS of 10.5 months and that these
PFS and OS were significantly greater than those with
chemotherapy alone or supportive care. However, the
efficacy of the maintenance TKI treatment of patients
with EGFR-mutated NSCLC did not differ significantly
from that of chemotherapy plus bevacizumab, but was
significantly better than that of chemotherapy alone or
supportive care. Moreover, the mPFS and mOS after
chemotherapy plus bevacizumab in patients with EGFR
wild-type NSCLC were significantly better than those
after chemotherapy alone or supportive care. Our current
study demonstrated that chemotherapy plus bevacizumab
was more effective on NSCLC patients with brain
metastasis and the adverse reactions were tolerable.
Further prospective studies are needed to confirm our
current findings.

Tumor metastasis is a multiple mechanistic process
by which tumor cells from a primary site invade and
metastasize to a secondary site, while metastasis to
the brain is even more complex. This is because tumor
brain metastases have their own characteristics. Tumor
metastasis to the brain can be divided into six basic steps:
escape from the primary site (escape), spreading into the
circulation system (dissemination), adhesion and vascular
wall (attachment), penetration of the blood–brain barrier
into the brain parenchyma (extravasation), brain microenvironment interactions (interaction), and growth in the
brain (or secondary site) (survival and proliferation) [31].
Kienast et al. [32] established a mouse brain metastasis
model by injecting tumor cells into the carotid artery and
used multiphoton laser scanning microscopy to image the
single steps of metastasis formation in real time. Their
findings revealed that the most critical step in tumor

metastasis to the brain is the blockage of tumor cells in the
microvessels, which allows them to effectively penetrate
the vessel walls, closely adhere to perivascular cells, and
form micrometastasis in the brain [32]. If tumor cells
fail to undergo these four steps, they become motionless,
decline, or die. Overall, only 1.0% ~2.4% of lung cancer
cells injected into the carotid artery completed the
metastasis process, which is lower than the 4.7% ~7.0%
of melanoma cells that complete the metastasis process
[32]. These results demonstrated that tumor cells exhibit
different biological behaviors in these fourth key steps,
i.e., the support of melanoma growth was a vascular
co-option that was dependent on the existing blood
vessels, and angiogenesis supported adenocarcinoma
metastatic cell growth. Thus, these previous findings
provided a mechanistic basis for anti-angiogenesis therapy
for lung cancer metastasis to the brain.
Bevacizumab is a recombinant, humanized
monoclonal antibody that directly targets vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [16]. The latter regulates
tumor-associated angiogenesis. Bevacizumab, combined
with platinum-based doublet regimen, is a US Food and
Drug Administration-approved first-line treatment for
patients with unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent,
or metastatic NSCLC [16, 33, 34]. In a previous phase
III study reported by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG), bevacizumab accession can significantly
improve the OS and PFS of NSCLC patients compared to
carboplatin/paclitaxel alone [16]. The results of our current
study showed that chemotherapy plus bevacizumab as the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

first-line treatment regimen was much more effective than
chemotherapy alone and comparable with TKI treatment
alone. With respect to the adverse effects of this regimen,
there were no grade 3–4 adverse reactions observed in
patients and no adverse reactions related to bevacizumab,
such as ICH, hypertension, epistaxis, proteinuria, and
hemoptysis, occurred. Thus, our finding suggests that
chemotherapy plus bevacizumab as the first-line treatment
had a better curative rate and tolerable adverse reactions
in NSCLC patients with brain metastasis, especially in
patients with EGFR wild type NSCLC.
Furthermore, previous studies have considered that
the effectiveness of chemotherapy is subject to a presumed
lack of effectiveness due to the blood–brain barrier [12].
Actually two reasons were behind the poor response: i)
Utilization rate of drug at the site of action remains low,
and ii) Intrinsic or acquired resistance to anticancer agents
[35]. This may be because overexpression or mutation
of drug-targeting enzymes leads to natural or acquired
resistance [35]. Pemetrexed has been therefore developed
to solve these problems by inhibiting at least three types
of enzymes [36]. Simultaneous inhibition of these three
enzymes at multiple sites could lead to improvement
of drug effectiveness. Thus, use of pemetrexed could
overcome intrinsic or acquired drug resistance, and
previous clinical studies confirmed the broad usefulness
of pemetrexed in the treatment of a variety of solid
tumors [36–38]. These enzymes include dihydrofolate
reductase (DHFR), thymidylate synthetase, glycinamideribonucleotide-formyl transferase [36–39]. In our current

study, the RRs and DCRs for different cytotoxic drugs did
not differ significantly, whereas the local RR and DCR for
regimens including pemetrexed were significantly greater
than those for regimens including paclitaxel. Our study
included five patients with single brain lesions that showed
CR after the treatment. This implies that pemetrexed was
able to pass through the blood–brain barrier to reach
tumor lesion. Thus, a regimen including pemetrexed may
outperform the other cytotoxic drugs.
In addition, a previous phase II clinical trial showed
that WBRT combined with the molecular targeted drug
erlotinib improved the OS of NSCLC patients with brain
metastasis, especially those with EGFR mutated NSCLC
[39]. Multiple studies suggest that WBRT combined
with TKIs was able to improve the control of disease
progression and was well tolerated [40]. The efficiency of
WBRT plus TKIs was about 70% in patients independent
of EGFR status [40], which was significantly higher than
that of WBRT or chemotherapy alone. Kim et al. treated
23 patients with EGFR-TKIs as the first line and showed
an mPFS of 7.1 months and an mOS of 18.8 months,
leading to a 82.6% control rate [41]. However, the use of
EGFR-TKIs as a first-line treatment remains controversial
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[41]. Moket al. analyzed the relevant literature and argued
that OS may not differ between EGFR-TKIs as the firstline or second-line therapy, but that this treatment strategy
can prolong the mPFS and delay the time of radiotherapy
as a first-line treatment to improve patients’ quality of life
[42]. In the current study, the efficacy of TKI maintenance
treatment in patients did not differ significantly from
that of chemotherapy plus bevacizumab, even in patients
with EGFR mutation. However, further studies are
needed before a conclusion can be drawn, because our
current study included only 75 patients who received this
treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
A total of 794 NSCLC patients with brain metastasis
were treated at Shandong Cancer Hospital & Institute
between January 2013 and January 2015. Eighteen patients
were excluded because: i) The pathological type of tumor
was not confirmed in 7 patients; ii) EGFR mutation status
was unknown in 3 patients, and iii) Survival data were
3641

Oncotarget

not available in 8 patients. Thus, 776 NSCLC patients
with brain metastasis were included in this retrospective
analysis. Among them, 50 patients were lung squamous
cell carcinoma and 726 were adenocarcinoma. There
were 416 NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation, whereas
360 patients had wild-type EGFR. In these 416 EGFRmutated NSCLC cases, 232  had Exon 19 deletion
mutation, whereas 184  had Exon 21:L858R or L861Q
mutations. The treatment regimens included adjuvant
chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus the targeted therapy
(Table 1). In addition, all 776 patients, except 61 patients
who only received supportive care, underwent concurrent
radiotherapy (WBRT or SRS). Among the 416 patients
with EGFR-mutated NSCLC, 249 were treated with
chemotherapy alone, 22 with supportive care, 75 with
TKIs alone, and 70 with adjuvant chemotherapy plus
bevacizumab treatment, including a pemetrexed regimen
(n = 37) or a taxane regimen (n = 33). All the first-line
chemotherapy were basis of platinum compounds, and
pemetrexed only for these patients. There were also 93
cases with PS ≥ 3 received different regimens of treatment
and these patients had a strong demand for more treatment;
thus, we also included them in this retrospective analysis.
Among the 360 patients with wild-type EGFR, 274 were
treated with chemotherapy alone, 39 with supportive care,
and 47 with adjuvant chemotherapy plus bevacizumab
treatment. This study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of Shandong Cancer Hospital & Institute
(Shandong, China). The patients or their guardians signed
an inform consent form before participation in this study.

software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). RRs among these
patients were compared and analyzed using the χ2 test, and
Fisher’s exact test was performed to analyze categorical
variables. The Cox regression model was used to identify
independent prognostic factors for NSCLC. mPFS and
mOS were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier curves and
statistically analyzed using the log-rank test. Two-sided
p values ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Data collection and evaluation criteria
We collected data regarding all clinicopathological
characteristics, treatment responses, and survival from
patients’ medical records. The treatment responses were
evaluated based on the RECIST 1.1 guidelines and
classified as complete response (CR), partial response
(PR), stable disease (SD), and progression of disease (PD).
CR and PR were included in the RR, whereas CR, PR,
and SD were included in the disease control rate (DCR).
Moreover, all 776 patients were followed up for a median
duration of 11.2 months, and the last follow-up date was in
May 2015. Survival data were collected through an active
follow-up based on the verification of the vital status of
these patients. OS was defined as the time from the date
patients received the first-line chemotherapy to death or
last follow-up, whereas PFS was defined as the time from
the date patients received the first-line chemotherapy
to disease progression or death. During the follow-up
period, 773 patients developed distant metastasis or local
recurrence or died of the disease.
