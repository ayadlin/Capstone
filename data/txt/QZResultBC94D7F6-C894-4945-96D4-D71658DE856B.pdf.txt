ABSTRACT
Concentrations of circulating galectin-3, a metastasis promoter, are greatly
increased in cancer patients. Here we show that 2- or 6-de-O-sulfated, N-acetylated
heparin derivatives are galectin-3 binding inhibitors. These chemically modified heparin
derivatives inhibited galectin-3-ligand binding and abolished galectin-3-mediated
cancer cell-endothelial adhesion and angiogenesis. Unlike standard heparin, these
modified heparin derivatives and their ultra-low molecular weight sub-fractions
had neither anticoagulant activity nor effects on E-, L- or P-selectin binding to their
ligands nor detectable cytotoxicity. Intravenous injection of such heparin derivatives
(with cancer cells pre-treated with galectin-3 followed by 3 subcutaneous injections
of the derivatives) abolished the circulating galectin-3-mediated increase in lung
metastasis of human melanoma and colon cancer cells in nude mice. Structural
analysis using nuclear magnetic resonance and synchrotron radiation circular
dichroism spectroscopies showed that the modified heparin derivatives bind to
the galectin-3 carbohydrate-recognition domain. Thus, these chemically modified,
non-anticoagulant, low-sulfated heparin derivatives are potent galectin-3 binding
inhibitors with substantial potential as anti-metastasis/cancer drugs.

circulating tumor micro-emboli, are both essential steps in
the metastatic cascade.
Galectin-3 is a galactoside-binding protein that
is expressed by various types of human cells. The
concentration of galectin-3 is elevated by up to 30-fold
in the circulation of cancer patients including those with
colon, breast, pancreatic, melanoma, lung, head and neck,
and ovarian cancer and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma [2–7].
Patients with metastasis have higher levels of circulating
galectin-3 than those with only localized tumors [2].
Recent studies have shown that increased concentrations

of circulating galectin-3 promote dissemination of tumour
cell metastatic spread to remote sites [8–17]. These effects
are partly attributable to its interaction with the oncofetal
Galβ1, 3GalNAcα- (TF) antigen expressed on the cancer
cell membrane-associated mucin proteins MUC1 [18]
and MUC4 [12]. The galectin-3-MUC1/4 interaction
induces MUC1/4 cell surface polarization and results in
the exposure of smaller cell surface adhesion molecules
leading to increased adhesion of disseminating tumor cells
to the vascular endothelium, and also increased aggregation
of cancer cells resulting in the potential formation of
circulating tumor emboli [9, 10]. Circulating galectin-3 also
promotes endothelial secretion of metastasis-promoting
cytokines [9] and cancer cell migration [13], proliferation
[14] and angiogenesis [15, 16]. Several biotech companies
have therefore initiated research programmes to develop
galectin-3 inhibitors for preventing metastasis. Several
have shown promise in animal models and are currently
undergoing clinical trials (e.g. GMCT-01 and GRMD-02;
GCS-100) [17].
Heparin is a heterogeneous N- and O-sulfated
glycosaminoglycan anti-coagulant that is often used
for the treatment or prevention of thromboembolism
in cancer patients. Previous studies have documented
an inhibitory effect of unfractionated heparin (UFH) in
animal models of cancer metastasis [19]. Human clinical
trials of unfractionated heparin (UFH) in cancer have,
however, been mixed, with some showing improved
patient survival and others showing no effect [20]. Part of
the unpredictability is believed to derive from the “nonspecific” effects of UFH on a wide variety of cellular
processes as a result of its interactions with many plasma
and cellular proteins due in part to its high charge [21],
and its ability to mimic heparan sulphate and interact
with complex signalling networks [22]. Up to 22% of all
plasma proteins have been shown to be extractable by
UFH affinity purification [23]. In addition, limitations on
dosage imposed by the anticoagulant activity of heparin
restrict its therapeutic efficacy as an anti-metastatic
agent. Recent clinical trials have focussed on use of low
molecular weight heparins (LMWH) in cancer and have
suggested possible survival benefit [21]. Chemically
modified heparins of lower molecular weight and
altered charge may have enhanced therapeutic ratios and
bioavailability, whilst exhibiting reduced off-target effects
(such as reduced anticoagulation properties) [24].
In a search for potential anti-metastasis agents
that target the actions of circulating galectin-3, several
chemically-modified (selectively de-sulfated) heparin
derivatives were screened and 2- or 6-de-O-sulfated
heparin derivatives were identified as potent galectin3-binding inhibitors. These chemically-modified
heparin derivatives, which show no detectable anticoagulant activity and cytotoxicity, bind to galectin-3
carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and inhibit
galectin-3-mediated cancer cell adhesion and angiogenesis
in vitro and metastasis in vivo in a mouse model.

Selectively de-sulfated, N-acetylated heparin
derivatives inhibit galectin-3 binding to
TF-expressing asialo-fetuin
Twenty-four heparin derivatives produced by
selective chemical modification and size fractionation
(Supplementary Table S3) were screened for their effects
on galectin-3 binding to the TF-expressing asialo-fetuin
(Supplementary Fig. S2). 2 or 6-de-sulfated, N-acetylated
heparin derivatives (E and F) and 2- and 6-de-O-sulfated,
N-sulfated heparin (G) produced significant inhibition of
galectin-3 binding to asialo-fetuin (Fig. 1A–1F). Note that
this binding inhibition was not observed by fully sulfated
unfractionated and unmodified heparin (Supplementary
Fig. S2). The ultra-low molecular weight sub-fractions
of these derivatives (<3000 Da; E3, F3 and G3) seem to
be more effective inhibitors of galectin-3 binding than
the unfractionated compounds on a weight basis. For
example, compound E showed a 20.0 ± 2.6% inhibition of
galectin-3 binding at a dose of 50 μg/ml, while its lower
molecular weight sub-fraction (E3) resulted in 44.9 ± 3.9%
inhibition at this concentration. Although there may be
little apparent difference between the inhibitory potency
of fractionated and unfractionated compounds on a simple
molar basis, comparisons on a weight basis may in fact
more accurately reflect available binding sites on these
polymeric molecules. When tested for their influence on
galectin-1, -4 and -8 binding to asialo-feutin under similar
conditions, none of the galectin-3-binding inhibitory
heparin derivatives showed significant inhibition of
binding by these galectins (Supplementary Fig. S3),
suggesting significant specificity for galectin-3 compared
to other galectin family members.

Low sulfated heparin derivatives inhibit
circulating galectin-3-mediated cancer
cell adhesion to endothelial monolayers
Increased cancer cell adhesion to vascular
endothelium is one of the important metastasis-promoting
effects of circulating galectin-3. As heparin derivatives
E, E3, F, F3, G and G3 each showed inhibition of
galectin-3 ligand-binding, their influence on galectin3-mediated cancer cell adhesion to primary endothelial
cells was assessed. Pre-treatment of MUC1-expressing
human melanoma ACA19+ cells with galectin-3 before
application of the cells to HUVEC monolayers resulted
in a ~50% increase of cell adhesion in comparison to the
BSA-treated control cells. Pre-incubation of galectin-3
with E, E3, F, F3, G or G3 followed by incubation with
ACA19+ and subsequent application of the cells to
HUVEC monolayers resulted in inhibition of galectin3-mediated cell adhesion in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 2).

Inhibition of selectin binding and hence of leucocyte
recruitment is another potential problem with standard
heparins used for metastasis prevention, so the effects
of the modified heparin derivatives on binding of E-,
L-, and P- selectins to their ligand sialyl Lewisx were
also tested. None of the heparin derivatives showed
detectable interference with selectin binding to sialyl
Lewisx (Table 2). Furthermore, none of the derivatives
showed any detectable cytotoxicity to cells when they
were treated at 100 μg/ml for 24 or 48 hr (Supplementary

secretion of metastasis-promoting cytokines takes over
20 hr [9–11]. The experiments were therefore designed
to capture both the short-term and longer-term effects
of circulating galectin-3 on metastasis. The mice were
injected via the tail vein with 2 μg galectin-3, equivalent
to 1.25 μg/ml blood (assuming 1.6 ml total blood volume),

subsequently given daily by subcutaneous injection
(Fig. 3A). The animals were sacrificed 5 weeks after tumor
cell injection and organs examined for metastases.
Metastasis was found to occur exclusively in the
lungs (no metastatic foci were observed in brain, liver,
kidney, spleen, stomach, colon, small intestine or heart).
In  comparison to the control group (238 ± 42 tumor
nodules per lung), the animals in the galectin-3-treated
group showed significantly more metastatic nodules
(437 ± 36 tumor nodules, p < 0.05) assessed by surface
inspection after blind labelling using a dissecting
microscope (Fig. 3B–3E). Significant reductions in tumor
numbers per lung, and lung weights were observed in the
group of animals that were treated with heparin derivatives

E (95 ± 38% reduction in galectin-3 induced metastasis,
p = 0.001), E3 (106 ± 19% reduction in galectin-3 induced
metastasis, p < 0.05) and F3 (161 ± 19% reduction in
galectin-3 induced metastasis, p < 0.01) in comparison to
the galectin-3 treated group (0 ± 18% reduction) (Fig. 3D
and 3E). A good positive correlation (R2 = 0.6) between
lung weight and tumor number was observed across all
treatment groups (Fig. 3E). There was no significant
difference in tumor nodule diameter measured from H and
E stained sections between any of the groups although data
showed a tendency towards reduced tumor diameter in E3
and F3 treated groups (data not shown). There was also no
significant difference of change of animal body weights
among the animal groups during the experimental period

(Supplementary Fig. S4A), suggesting these heparin
derivatives, like the standard heparin, have no apparent
toxicity. Notably F3 not only abolished the circulating
galectin-3-induced increase in metastasis as judged
by lung weight, but also caused a significant additional
reduction in metastasis compared to the control (control,
0.32 ± 0.03 g; F3, 0.18 ± 0.02 g; p < 0.05).
Similar effects were observed with human colon
cancer SW620 cells in this mouse model. Approximately
40% increase in the number of metastatic foci per lung
was observed in mice co-injected with a single tail vein
injection of 2 μg galectin-3 in comparison to control
mice after 7 weeks (Fig. 4A). Again, administration
of the heparin derivatives E, E3 or F3 along with

galectin-3 caused a reduction of metastatic foci per
lung in comparison to the galectin-3-treated animals
(Fig. 4B–4D; p < 0.05). A positive correlation of lung
weight versus tumor number was observed across all
treatment groups (Fig. 4E). Again, heparin F3 treatment
resulted in a greater reduction in lung weight compared with
all other groups and there were no significant differences in
animal body weights among the animal groups during the
experimental period (Supplementary Fig. S4B).
To further assess the influence of these heparin
derivatives on inhibition of galectin-3-mediated metastasis,
three different doses (10, 20 or 40 mg/kg) of compound
F3 were tested using the same dosing regimen as outlined
in Fig. 3A. Again, a significant increase in number of lung

metastatic foci occurred in mice treated with galectin-3
in comparison to the control group. Administration of
either 20 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg, but not 10 mg/kg, of F3,
caused a significant reduction in the number of metastatic
nodules (Fig. 5A and 5B). A strong positive correlation
was again observed between the tumor number and
lung weight across all treatment groups (R2=0.8;
Fig. 5C). No adverse effects or evidence of toxicity were
observed in these mice following any dose or at any
time-point. Together, these in vivo results indicate that
these chemically-modified heparin derivatives inhibit
circulating galectin-3-mediated metastasis and are
well tolerated.

recombinant galectin-3 at 2 μg/ml (Fig. 6). Pre-incubation
of galectin-3 with 1 or 100 μg/ml of each heparin
derivative inhibited exogenous galectin-3-induced increase
in endothelial tubule formation; all of the derivatives
significantly reduced and in most cases completely
abolished the galectin-3 induction in a dose dependent
manner (Fig. 6). Of note, compound F and some of the
ultra-low molecular weight sub-fractions (E3, F3, and G3)
were able to inhibit tubule formation beyond control
levels, indicating that these compounds are also able to
inhibit angiogenesis beyond that induced by exogenous/
circulating galectin-3 (Fig.  6). Indeed, when these
compounds were tested in an in vivo chick chorioallantoic
membrane angiogenesis model, compounds E and F
exhibited significant inhibitory effects on VEGF-induced
angiogenesis, particularly in the case of F which exerted
> 95% inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S5; p < 0.05).

Low sulfated heparin derivatives inhibit
galectin-3-induced endothelial tubule formation
Increased tumor angiogenesis is another
common effect of galectin-3 on cancer progression and
metastasis [15, 16, 33, 34], and some modified heparins
have previously been shown to have anti-angiogenic
properties [35]. The effects of the heparin derivatives and
their low molecular weight sub-fractions were therefore
assessed on galectin-3-mediated angiogenesis in vitro.
A 54.2 ± 16.0% increase in HUVEC tubule number, 55.1 ±
15.8% increase in tubule length and 80 ± 21.7% increase
in junction number were observed in the presence of

Low sulfated heparin derivatives inhibit

To assess whether these modified heparin derivatives
also affect endogenous galectin-3-mediated activities, we
suppressed galectin-3 expression in SW620 cells using
shRNA. The stably transfected cells showed 84% reduction
of galectin-3 expression in comparison to the un-transfected

or negatively-transfected cells (Fig.  7A). Suppression
of galectin-3 expression was seen to be associated with a
38% reduction in the adhesion of these cells to HUVEC
cells when compared with the galectin-3-expressing cells
(Fig.  7B), confirming a role of cancer cell-associated
galectin-3 in cancer cell-endothelial adhesion, as shown
by several previous studies [36, 37]. Whilst lactose and
the modified heparin derivative E3 both caused significant
inhibition (43 and 37%, respectively) of cell adhesion to
HUVEC of the galectin-3-expressing SW620Gal3+ cells,
neither of them showed an effect on the adhesion of galectin3-suppressed SW620Gal3- cells. Also, the inhibitory effect
(51%) of heparin derivative F3 on SW620Gal3+ adhesion
to HUVEC was substantially reduced in SW620Gal3- cells
(32%) (Fig. 7B). Together, these results indicate that the
heparin derivatives also inhibit cell adhesion mediated
by cancer cell-associated galectin-3. This is in keeping
with the observed further inhibition of lung metastasis
below the numbers seen in the control animals that had
not received exogenous galectin-3 (Fig. 4D and 5D), and
supports an inhibitory effect of the heparin derivatives also
on endogenous galectin-3-mediated actions in metastasis.

NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance). The 2D 1H-15N HSQC
spectra of the protein in the absence and presence of the
ligands were compared; residues whose chemical shifts
were affected by the presence of the ligands were deemed
to be either directly involved with binding the ligands or
indirectly affected due to conformational/environmental
changes. This method allows the identification of the
ligand binding sites. In the presence of lactose, resonances
from His158, Asn160, Glu184, Asn174 and Trp181
(Supplementary Fig. S6 and Fig. 8A and 8B) showed
significant chemical shift changes. These data are in
agreement with the previously published crystallography
structure of the Gal-3C-lactose complex [38] and indicate
the critical involvement of these amino acids in lactose
binding. Some of these amino acids (e.g. His158 and
Asn160) were also seen to be involved in F3 and E3
binding. In addition, the resonance of some residues such
as Phe 149, Asn160 and Thr175, which were not perturbed
by lactose binding, appeared to be affected by F3 binding.
Resonances from Phe149 and Thr 175, but not Asn 160,
appeared to be perturbed by E3 binding. The binding of
the modified heparin derivatives to galectin-3 at 1:20
titration induced a similar magnitude of chemical shift
changes to lactose, suggesting that the binding affinities of
lactose, E3 and F3 are probably similar (lactose has been
reported to bind galectin-3 with a Kd of 110 μM, [16].
These results indicate that the heparin derivatives bind to
the galectin-3 CRD domain in a similar manner as lactose,

although slightly more amino acids appear to be involved
with the E3 and F3 binding; this is not surprising given
that these heparin derivatives are larger than lactose and
hence able to form a larger carbohydrate:protein interface.
We also assessed the interaction of these heparin
derivatives with galectin-3 in solution by Synchrotron
Radiation Circular Dichroism (SRCD) spectroscopy.
SRCD spectroscopy conducted in the far-UV region
(125–260 nm) is highly sensitive to changes in protein
secondary structure [30] in solution and provides
unequivocal evidence of conformational change in
a protein upon ligand binding. It was found that the
presence of fractions E, F and G and their respective subfractions E3, F3 and G3, like lactose, all caused distinct
secondary structural changes in galectin-3. These results
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

are consistent with the NMR finding. Interestingly, each
fraction induced slightly different secondary structural
changes in galectin-3, implying distinctive modes of
interaction (Fig. 8C).

DISCUSSION
This study shows that several chemically modified,
de-O-sulfated, N-acetylated heparin derivatives are
effective galectin-3 binding inhibitors. Interaction of
these low sulfated heparin derivatives with galectin-3

Moreover, these modified heparin derivatives show no

binding to sialyl LewisX antigen and no detectable
cytotoxicity.
Galectin-3 is overexpressed by most types of cancer
cells and is involved in cancer development, progression
and metastasis. Galectin-3 is found intracellularly, on
the cell surface and also in the circulation. Cytoplasmic
galectin-3 is an apoptosis inhibitor and promotes
neoplastic transformation and tumorigenesis [39].
Galectin-3-expressed on the surface of cancer cells
acts as an adhesion molecule and promotes cancer
cell-cell and cell-matrix interaction during cancer cell
invasion and migration [40]. Extracellular galectin-3
binds to cell surface N-glycans and induces monocyte
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and T cell apoptosis thus facilitating tumor cell evasion
from immune surveillance [40, 41] whilst circulating
galectin-3 promotes disseminating tumor cell adhesion
to vascular endothelium and increases the formation of
tumor microemboli thus prolonging tumor cell survival in
the circulation [10]. Such broad cancer- and metastasispromoting actions of galectin-3 have prompted many
laboratories over recent years to explore therapeutic
strategies that target galectin-3. These include the
development of a TF antigen-mimicking vaccine,
anti-MUC1 antibodies, truncated galectin-3 form [42],
peptide-based inhibitors [43], carbohydrate-based small
synthetic inhibitors [44–47] and natural galectin-3
inhibitors such as modified citrus pectin [48]. Lactose and
galactose are themselves natural inhibitors of galectin-3,
though they have weak binding affinity [10, 11, 18].

Previous studies have shown that standard,
unfractionated heparins have a variety of anti-metastatic
activities that include inhibition of tumor growth,
inhibition of selectin-mediated tumor cell interaction
with leukocytes and endothelial cells, inhibition of
angiogenesis, growth factor-mediated processes and
the inhibition of tumor cell emboli formation [49].
Unfractionated heparin blocks binding of P- and
L-selectins and thus prevents tumor cells from forming
micro-emboli through interaction with platelets and
leukocytes. However, blocking the action of selectins may
compromise immune responses by impairing recruitment
of leukocytes. A non-anticoagulant N-acetylated heparin
reduces metastasis in P- and L-selectin deficient mice
[50] suggesting that selectin inhibition is not the only
mechanism by which heparin exerts its anti-tumor effects.
The low-sulfated heparin derivatives identified in this
study, which do not affect binding of selectins, may be
better suited to therapeutic anti-cancer use.
It is interesting that these modified heparin
derivatives, although not galactose-containing and thus
lacking the canonical binding moiety for this class of
lectins, can inhibit galectin-3 binding and galectin-3mediated cell-cell interactions. The galectin-3 carbohydrate
recognition domain (CRD), which includes 127 amino
acid residues, contains several stranded β-sheets which
form a binding pocket. More than 10 of the CRD amino
acid residues are known to be involved in galectin-3
binding to TF disaccharide as revealed by NMR analysis
[51]. Our NMR binding analysis showed that the heparin
derivatives F3 and E3 bind to the galectin-3 CRD domain,
associating with similar residues as utilised by lactose,
implying binding to the same site. The small variations in
chemical shift changes between F3, E3 and lactose were
to be expected given the differences in the ligand sizes.
In addition, circular dichroism data showed that F3 and
E3 binding, like lactose, also induced conformational
changes in galectin-3 (Fig. 8). Previous studies have
shown that several 15~16 mer synthetic peptides
identified by bacteriophage display technology are strong
galectin-3 binding inhibitors (kd 17–80 nM) [43]. These
synthetic peptides, although not modified with any
galactose residues, were reported to bind to the galectin-3
CRD and inhibit galectin-3-TF interaction, and prevent
galectin-3-mediated cancer cell adhesion, aggregation
in vitro and metastasis in vivo [52]. Thus non-galactosecontaining molecules are capable of being galectin-3
inhibitors if they possess appropriate binding properties
and conformations.
It should be mentioned that our previous studies
have reported that endotoxin content in recombinant
galectin-3 is negligible and does not affect galectin-3
activity [9]. It is therefore extremely unlikely that
endotoxin will have any influence on the effect of heparin
derivatives shown in this study. Moreover the galectin-3
effects, that were inhibitable by some of the modified
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

heparins, were themselves inhibitable by TF-expressing
glycans/lactose indicating that they were not related to any
endotoxin contamination.
It was noticed that administration of the low
molecular weight compounds E3 and F3 not only
abolished the lung metastasis induced by exogenously
introduced galectin-3, but also produced further
inhibition of lung metastasis below the numbers seen
in the control animals, that had not received exogenous
galectin-3. This implies additional anti-metastatic effects
of the compounds that are independent of interaction with
exogenous galectin-3. Endogenous galectin-3 expressed
on the surface of cancer cells [40] [both SW620 [53]
and ACA19+ [54] cells express galectin-3 and vascular
endothelial cells [55] is also known to enhance metastasis
by acting as an adhesion molecule to promote cancerendothelial cell adhesion. The discovery that suppression
of galectin-3 expression in SW620 cells by shRNA
abolished or largely reduced the inhibitory effect of
these heparin derivatives on adhesion of the cells to
endothelial cells (Fig. 7) supports this. The importance of
galectin-3 in promoting angiogenesis has been reported
previously [15, 16] so the anti-angiogenic action of these
compounds may also contribute to these additional antimetastasis effects.
It is also noteworthy that the Balb/c nude mice used
in this study have no T cells. As galectin-3 can also act
on tumor-infiltrating T cells to impair their anti-tumor
function [41], it is possible that these chemically-modified
heparin derivatives could possess additional anti-tumor
effects in cancer patients as a result of inhibition of
galectin-3-mediated T cell apoptosis.
In summary, several chemically modified, low
sulfated heparin derivatives have been identified as potent
galectin-3 binding inhibitors. These heparin derivatives
bind to the galetin-3 carbohydrate-recognition domain
and inhibit galectin-3-ligand binding and galectin-3mediated metastasis. Importantly, these chemically
modified heparin derivatives have no anti-coagulant
activities, no effect on P-, L- or E-selectin-ligand binding
and no detectable cytotoxicity. They therefore represent a
very promising new class of therapeutic agents to target
galectin-3-mediated metastasis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Production of chemically modified heparin
derivatives
Standard heparin (average MW~12–15 kDa) was
chemically modified by selective desulfation as previously
described [25]. Structural modifications were confirmed
by NMR spectroscopy (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).
Different size fractions were produced from these modified
heparins by partial depolymerisation using chemical
β-elimination [26]. Three broad size fractions were then
23682

Oncotarget

separated by subjecting the partially depolymerised
materials to gel filtration chromatography using Sephadex
G-100 (Supplementary Fig. S1). The resulting size
fractions were then assessed as ultra-low molecular
weight (<3 kDa), low molecular weight (~3–7 kDa) and
intermediate molecular weight (>7 kDa), using heparin
fractions of known sizes as reference standards.

and grown in minimal medium with 15NH4Cl as the
nitrogen source. The protein expression was induced with
1 mM IPTG when OD600 reached 0.6–0.85. Following
overnight incubation at 18°C, the cells were harvested and
lysed using a cell homogenizer. The cell supernatant was
applied to a HisTrap FF 5 ml column (GE Healthcare)
and the His-tagged recombinant Gal-3C was eluted
with 500  mM Imidazole. The eluted protein was treated
with TEV protease (1 mg of TEV protease /15 mg of the
protein) to remove the His-tag. After application onto the
HisTrap FF 5 ml column to remove the cleaved His-tag
and TEV protease, the proteins were further purified using
a Superdex75 16/60 column (GE Healthcare), the purified
recombinant Gal-3C was eluted at 220 and 260 ml. SDSPAGE analysis revealed the purity of the recombinant
Gal-3C to be >95%.

ELISA
Ninety-six well plates were coated overnight
with coating buffer (15 mM Na2CO3, 17 mM HaHCO3,
pH 9.6) containing asialo-fetuin (ASF; 20 μg/ml) or
bovine serum albumin (BSA; 20 μg/ml). Asialo-fetuin
(sigma), produced by neuraminidase treatment of fetuin
that removes terminal sialic acid and exposes galactose
residues, contains several terminal galactose residues
[27] and is a typical galectin-3 binding ligand and is
recognized by other galectin members such as galectin-1,
-2, -4 and -8 (2). Galectin-3 (2 μg/ml), heparin derivatives
(0–200 μg/ml) or lactose (100 μM) were added to a second
BSA-coated 96-well plate for 15 minutes prior to transfer
onto the assay plate for 1 hour at room temperature.
Plates were washed with PBS and probed with a biotinconjugated anti-galectin-3 antibody (0.5 μg/ml; R&D
Systems BAF1154) for 1 hour and detection was carried
out using ExtrAvidin-peroxidase and OPD (Sigma) as
per the manufacturer’s instructions. OD values were
determined at 492 nm with a reference at 595 nm using a
micro plate reader (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland).

NMR analysis
Galectin-3 interactions with lactose and the heparin
derivatives E3 and F3 were analysed by NMR at 298 K in
a Bruker 800 MHz solution-state spectrometer equipped
with cryogenic probe head. 2D 1H-15N HSQC experiments
were performed on 15N-labelled Gal-3C at a concentration
of 100 μM in 50 mM Phosphate buffer, 100 mM
NaCl  pH6.7. 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectra were acquired
at 1:1, 1:2.5, 1:5, 1:10 and 1:20 protein:ligand ratios.
Data were processed using the Bruker Software TopSpin
and analysed using CCPN software [28]. Resonance
assignments were transferred from Biological Magnetic
Resonance Bank (BMRB) Accession No 4909, with some
additional assignments made within this work. The ligand
binding sites were mapped using chemical shift changes
between Gal-3C and Gal-3C-ligand spectra [29, 30].

Synchrotron radiation circular dichroism
(SRCD) spectroscopy
SRCD was carried out using Diamond B23
beamline Module B end-station with calcium fluoride cells
of path length 0.1mm (190–260 nm). Samples that were
assessed were galectin-3 (0.5 mg/ml), alone and galectin-3
mixed with each of the six heparin derivatives (0.5 mg/ml)
in PBS. The SRCD analysis reports on structural changes
within the galectin-3 molecule upon interaction with
each heparin derivative in solution. The spectral analyses
do not describe the degree of galectin-3 inhibition but
determine whether each heparin derivative causes the
same or different changes in galectin-3 conformation.

Cell lines
ACA19+ cells, previously stably transfected with
human MUC1 of human melanoma A375 cells [31],
were a gift from Dr John Hilkens (The Netherland
Cancer Institute) in 2012. The human SW620 colorectal
adenocarcinoma cells obtained in 1998 from the European
Cell Culture Collection (Wiltshire, UK) express high
levels of cell surface MUC1 [32]. The cell lines were
last authenticated by DNA profiling (DNA Diagnostics
Center, London; May 2014). ACA19+ and SW620 cells
were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s medium
containing 10% fetal calf serum. Human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVEC) cells were maintained in
EBM-2 culture medium (EGM-2 BulletKit; Lonza).

Production of 15N-labelled recombinant
galectin-3
The cDNA sequence encoding the C-terminal
carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of galectin-3
(Gal-3C) (residues 115–250) was cloned into a pETM11A
expression vector. The vector was transformed into E.coli
BL21(DE3) strain by addition of 50 ng of the plasmid
to 50 μl of BL21 cells, followed by heat shock for 45
seconds at 42°C then 1 hr recovery in LB media at 37°C.
Transformants were selected with 32 μg/ml kanamycin
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Generation of stable galectin-3 knockdown cells
SW620 cells were seeded at 0.5 × 105 cells/ml in
96-well plates and incubated at 37°C until 50–60%
confluent. Cells were then treated with 100 ng
MISSION shRNA plasmid DNA (TRCN0000029305,
23683

Oncotarget

Sigma) or empty vector control (SHC002, Sigma)
with the transfection reagent metafectene (Biontex) in
a 1:4 plasmid:metafectene (w/v) ratio for 6 hr at 37°C.
The transfected cells were selected by treatment with
8 μg/ml puromycin over 72 hr, followed by 48 hr with
4 μg/ml puromycin. Cells were then released by trypsin,
suspended in complete culture medium to highly-diluted
cell suspension and plated in a 96-well plate. Wells
containing a single cell were identified by microscope.
Following further culture to allow cell proliferation and
colony formation, galectin-3 expression was determined
by galectin-3 immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry
to allow separate selection of galectin-3 expressing
(SW620Gal3+) and knockdown (SW620Gal3-) cells/colonies.

for 24 hr. The tubule number, tubule length and junction
number were then quantified from one low power field per
well. Tubule length was quantified using ImageJ software.

Anticoagulant activity measurements
For Factor Xa and Factor IIa assays, increasing
concentrations of heparin or heparin derivatives
(in 0.9% NaCl) were incubated for 2 minutes at 37°C with
2 nKat/ml bovine Factor Xa or bovine Factor IIa (both
from Sigma-Aldrich, in dH2O) and 0.003 IU/ml bovine
antithrombin III (Sigma-Aldrich, in 50 mM Tris HCl,
0.175  M NaCl and 7.5 mM EDTA). Two hundred  μM
Factor Xa chromogenic substrate (Sigma-Aldrich, in
dH2O) was added and samples were incubated for another
45 seconds at 37°C. The reaction was stopped with
25% glacial acetic acid. Colour change was assessed by
absorbance at 405 nm.
Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT Assay)
was carried out in a cylindrical cuvette (Behnk Elektronik).
The cuvette was pre-warmed to 37°C on a heating
block, placed in the coagulation analyser (Axis Shield
Thrombotrack) and charged with a ball bearing, normal
citrated plasma (50 μL, Technoclone), Pathromtin SL (50 μL,
Siemens) and test sample (25 μL). Following incubation for
2 minutes, pre-warmed (37°C) calcium chloride (25 μL) was
added and the coagulation analyser was initiated. Clotting
times are reported as the time at which the coagulometer was
no longer able to stir the sample. Unclotted samples after
120 seconds were recorded as ‘no clot.’
Prothrombin Time (PT Assay) was carried out in
a  cylindrical cuvette (Behnk Elektronik). The cuvette
was pre-warmed to 37°C on a heating block, placed in
the coagulation analyser (Axis Shield Thrombotrack) and
charged with a ball bearing and normal citrated plasma
(50 μL, Technoclone). Following incubation for 1 minute,
pre-warmed (37°C) test sample (50 μL) was added along
with Thromborel® S reagent (50 μL, Siemens). Upon
addition of the final reagent, the coagulation analyser
was initiated. Clotting times are reported as the time
at which the coagulometer was no longer able to stir
the sample. Unclotted samples after 120 seconds were
recorded as ‘no clot.’

Galectin-3 immunofluorescence
The transfected cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/
well into 24-well plates with glass coverslips inserted
and cultured until 50–70% confluent. Cells were washed
with PBS, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and treated
with blocking solution (1% BSA/PBS) for 45 min before
application of 2 μg/ml anti-human galectin-3 antibody
(R&D Systems) for 2 hr. After two washes with PBS,
FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution)
was applied for 1 hr. After 6 washes with PBS, the
cells were mounted using DAPI-containing fluorescent
mounting medium (Vector) and images were acquired
using an Olympus BX51 fluorescent microscope.

Adhesion assay
HUVEC cells were plated into 96-well plates at
104 cells/well and cultured for two days at 37°C. ACA19+,
SW620Gal3+ and SW620Gal3- cells were harvested using
non-enzymatic cell dissociation solution (Sigma) and
were incubated with Calcein AM (Invitrogen) at 37°C
in the dark for 30 minutes. HUVEC monolayers were
washed twice with PBS. Galectin-3 (final concentration
1 μg/ml) and heparin derivatives (final concentration
0.1–100 μg/ml) were added to HUVEC monolayers in
50 μl serum-free media (containing 0.5 mg/ml BSA). The
cells were washed twice with PBS and 50 μl of 2 × 105
cells/ml were added to each well. Cells were allowed
to adhere for 1 hr and plates were washed gently twice.
Adherent cells were lysed with 0.25% SDS and the
fluorescent intensity was measured by a fluorescence plate
reader at excitation 485 nm and emission 535 nm.

Selectin binding analysis
Recombinant human L-selectin (10 ng/ml),
P-selectin (10 ng/ml) or E-selectin (30 ng/ml) Fc chimeras
(R&D Systems) were mixed with increasing concentrations
of heparin or heparin derivatives in PBS before addition
to 96-well ELISA plates precoated with BSA-Sialyl
Lewisx (110 ng/well, R&D Systems) for 45  minutes at
room temperature. The plates were washed three times
with 200 μl of Quantikine wash buffer (R&D Systems)
and the bound selectins were detected using an HRP-anti
Fc antibody and Substrate Reagent Pack (R&D Systems)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Angiogenesis assay
Fifty microlitres per well of 10 mg/ml matrigel (BD
Biosciences) was plated in 96-well plates and allowed to
set in an incubator at 37°C. HUVEC cells were plated at
1.5 × 104 cells/well in reduced growth factor EGM-2 media
(50% kit concentration) containing galectin-3 (2 μg/ml)
without or with heparin derivative (1–100 μg/ml) or PBS

FUNDING
This study was funded by a Medical Research Council
UK grant G1000772 (to LG Yu, JM Rhodes, DM Pritchard,
EA Yates, JE Turnbull). P Sindrewicz was supported by an
MRC Industrial Case Studentship and A Hughes by a PhD
studentship funded by MRC and Diamond Light Source UK
(projects SM-9218 and SM-8596).

In vivo metastasis
Female Balb/c nude (CAnN.Cg-FOX1NU/Crl)
mice aged 6–7 weeks were purchased from Charles
River Laboratories (Margate, UK) and maintained at the
University of Liverpool in specific pathogen-free conditions
with a 12:12 hour light:dark cycle. All animal studies
were conducted with UK Home Office and local ethics
committee approval from the University of Liverpool.
Mice were administered PBS, galectin-3 (2 μg)
or galectin-3 plus 20 mg/kg heparin derivative in PBS,
via tail vein injection. Twenty four hr later, a second
intravenous injection was conducted with either 1 × 106
ACA19+ cells/mouse or 2 × 106 SW620 cells/mouse that
had been pre-incubated with PBS, galectin-3 (2 μg) or
galectin-3 plus heparin derivative (20 mg/kg) for 1 hour
prior to injection. Subcutaneous injections were then
administered daily for 3 days with either PBS or heparin
derivative (20 mg/kg). Mice were sacrificed by cervical
dislocation 5 (ACA19+) or 7 (SW620) weeks following
the tumor cell injection and organs were harvested for
macroscopic and microscopic assessment. Tumor number
on the surface of the lungs was assessed using a dissection
microscope (Motic, Redding, UK). Lung weight was also
assessed as an indicator of tumor burden.
Tissue was fixed overnight in 4% formalin,
processed and paraffin-embedded. Sections of organs
(lungs, brain, kidney, liver, small intestine, colon, stomach,
spleen) were assessed for tumor formation from H and E
sections. Lung tumor size was quantified using a graticule
and x5 objective on a light microscope. All tumors on
one section per lung were assessed for their maximum
dimension (the majority were spherical nodules).
