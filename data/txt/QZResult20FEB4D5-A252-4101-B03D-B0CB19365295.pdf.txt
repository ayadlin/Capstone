ABSTRACT
Adipose-derived stem cells are capable of differentiating into multiple cell types
and thus considered useful for regenerative medicine. However, this differentiation
feature seems to be associated with tumor initiation and metastasis raising safety
concerns, which requires further investigation. In this study, we isolated adiposederived stem cells from subcutaneous as well as from visceral adipose tissues of the
same donor and systematically compared their features. Although being characteristic
of mesenchymal stem cells, subcutaneous adipose-derived stem cells tend to be
spindle form-like and are more able to home to cancer cells, whereas visceral adiposederived stem cells incline to be “epithelial”-like and more competent to differentiate.
Moreover, compared to subcutaneous adipose-derived stem cells, visceral adiposederived stem cells are more capable of promoting proliferation, inducing the
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, enhancing migration and invasion of breast
cancer cells by cell-cell contact and by secreting interleukins such as IL-6 and IL8. Importantly, ASCs affect the low malignant breast cancer cells MCF-7 more than
the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells. Induction of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition is mediated by the activation of multiple pathways especially the PI3K/
AKT signaling in breast cancer cells. BCL6, an important player in B-cell lymphoma
and breast cancer progression, is crucial for this transition. Finally, this transition
fuels malignant properties of breast cancer cells and render them resistant to ATP
competitive Polo-like kinase 1 inhibitors BI 2535 and BI 6727.

INTRODUCTION

shows a high secretive activity and is an extensive source
of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or more specifically
adipose-derived stem/stroma cells (ASCs). ASCs are
capable of differentiating into multiple cell types such as
adipocytes, neurons, osteoblasts and retain the ability of
self-renewing [3]. By virtue of their regenerative features
like pro-angiogenic, anti-apoptotic, pro-proliferative and
multipotent differentiation, ASCs are widely considered
as a promising tool for regenerative medicine application
and tissue engineering [4, 5], such as breast reconstruction
after breast ablation in cancer patients. Unfortunately, the

Breast cancer is the second most common cancer
worldwide with 1.7 million cases and over 522,000 deaths
per year [1]. During the last years, numerous investigations
have reported a complex signaling network between breast
cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment which
affects tumor malignance and therapeutic responsiveness
[2]. Adipose tissue, a metabolically active endocrine
organ, is the most abundant stromal constituent in the
mammary gland surrounding breast cancer. This tissue

same features of ASCs that induce tissue regeneration
and vascularization are also assumed to be associated
with tumor initiation and metastasis [6] raising safety
concerns about clinical utilization. Therefore, ASCs have
been intensively investigated for their role in cancer
cell proliferation, migration and metastasis [7]. While
numerous investigations indicate that ASCs promote tumor
growth and malignant phenotypes in multiple cancer types
[7], supported by in vivo studies showing increased tumor
growth, metastatic spread and angiogenesis [7, 8], other
studies reveal a therapeutic potential of ASCs in breast
cancer models in vitro and in vivo [9, 10].
To further delineate the relationship between ASCs
and cancer progression, we have isolated ASCs from
visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue collected from
female donors undergoing caesarian section, characterized
their features and studied their impact on breast cancer
cells. To exclude variations between isolated ASCs from
different donors, we performed most of the studies with
paired visceral and subcutaneous ASCs of the same donor
with a comprehensive number. Our study reveals distinct
properties of these two types of ASCs with varied effects
on cancer cells. Interestingly, visceral ASCs are more
potent to induce the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
in breast cancer cells mediated by activating multiple
pathways in particular the PI3K/AKT signaling.

CD34 measured by flow cytometry (Table 2). Indirect
immunofluorescence staining in ASCs further underscored
the positive signals of CD90 and CD73 (Figure 1B), which
were negative in MCF-7 cells (Figure S1A). In addition,
the signals of CD14 and CD31 were undetectable in
ASCs using immunofluorescence staining (Figure S1B).
ASCs were then induced into adipogenic, neurogenic and
osteogenic cells, and the in vitro differentiation potential
was determined by lineage-specific staining. After 14 days
of neurogenic induction, 43% of visceral ASCs showed
lineage specific staining of Tuj1, a marker for class III
β-tubulin, and DCX, a marker for developing neurons,
in addition to neuronal branching among differentiated
cells (Figure 1C, 1st panel and Figure 1D). 34% of visceral
ASCs were positively stained for adiponectin, one of
the adipokines secreted by adipocytes, confirming the
adipogenic differentiation capacity (Figure 1C, 2nd panel
and Figure 1D). The osteogenic differentiation was
verified by alizarin red S staining in 15% of cells (Figure
1C, 3rd panel and Figure 1D). All these differentiation
markers were negative in non-differentiated ASCs
(Figure S1C). Moreover, compared to visceral ASCs,
subcutaneous ASCs of the same donor displayed less
differentiating capability by showing only 37% positive
in neuronal markers, 29% in adipogenic markers and 9%
in alizarin red S (Figure S1D), indicating that these two
types of ASCs exhibit not only varied morphology but also
different differential potential.

RESULTS

ASCs secrete various factors and are attracted to
breast cancer cells

Visceral and subcutaneous ASCs display distinct
morphologies and multipotent differentiation
potential

As mesenchymal stem cells are a source of many
secreted cytokines, chemokines and growth factors [13],
we analyzed next these factors in conditioned media from
cultured ASCs with human cytokine arrays. Indeed, the
array assay underscored the secretion of various cytokines,
chemokines and growth factors by both types of ASCs
(Table 3), especially IL-6, GRO, IL-8, IL-10, agiogenin
and CCL5 showed high expression levels (Figure 2A). The
secretion pattern of visceral and subcutaneous ASCs was
very similar, however, the expression level varied between
these two types of ASCs. Compared to subcutaneous
ASCs, visceral ASCs were clearly more capable of
secreting these factors (Table 3 and Figure 2A). Most of
the detected secreted factors are known to be involved in
cancer cell proliferation and progression [14].
Many studies have reported a tropism of ASCs
toward cancer cells [15]. To underline this observation,

ASCs were isolated from visceral and subcutaneous
adipose tissues, using a well-established method [11],
from female donors undergoing caesarian sections
(Table 1). These two types of ASCs displayed distinct
morphologies at their early passages 1-3: visceral ASCs
were more “epithelial”-like with an apical-basal polarity
of the tubulin and vimentin cytoskeleton (Figure 1A,
1st panel), whereas subcutaneous ASCs were more
characteristic of a fibroblast-like morphology with a
small cell body (Figure 1A, 2nd panel). Yet, ASCs isolated
from both sources exhibited typical cell surface markers
for mesenchymal stem cells described by the Society
for Cellular Therapy [11, 12]: positive for CD90, CD73,
CD146 and highly negative for CD14, CD31, CD106 and

we performed attraction assays, where we seeded visceral/
subcutaneous ASCs and breast cancer cells in separated
chambers of a culture insert with a defined cell free gap
between these two chambers. The number of membrane
protrusions of ASCs toward cancer cells, including
lamellipodia and filopodia, was evaluated evidencing
the tropism of ASCs. Both types of ASCs, especially
subcutaneous ASCs, showed an increased homing ability
toward breast cancer cells MCF-7, MDA-MB-231,
fibroblasts and cervical carcinoma HeLa cells during
the time period of 15 h (Figure 2B and 2C, and Figure
S2A and B). By contrast, the normal mammary epithelial
MCF-10A cells were not able to attract these two types
of ASCs (Figure 2B, right panel, and Figure 2C, panel 5
and 6). To corroborate these results, we stained MCF-7
and MDA-MB-231 cells after 15 h for migration markers
acetylated α-tubulin, phospho-Focal Adhesion Kinase
(p-FAK) and phalloidin. The staining of phalloidin as
well as p-FAK illustrated cytoskeleton protrusion of both
ASC types, in particular subcutaneous ASCs, toward
MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 2D). Interesting,

the staining of acetylated α-tubulin was highly intensified
on the connections between ASCs and breast cancer cells,
likely to stabilize these new formed interactions (Figure
2D). Collectively, the data indicate that ASCs can interact
with cancer cells directly via cell-cell connections and
indirectly by the secretion of various soluble factors.

Enhanced proliferation of breast cancer cells
following direct co-culture with ASCs
To address if ASCs have an effect on the
proliferation of cancer cell lines, we performed
cell viability assays. To determine the optimal ASC
concentration, cell viability assays were performed
with MCF-7 cells in the presence of increased ASC
concentrations (5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 30%). 20% of
ASCs was taken for further investigations as it displayed
the strongest promotion in MCF-7 cell proliferation
(Figure S2C). In a direct co-culture manner with 20% of
ASCs, the viability of breast cancer cells together with

ASCs was measured at indicated time points. Compared
to normal mammary epithelial cells MCF-10A (Figure
3A), low malignant breast cancer cells MCF-7 expanded
significantly faster in the presence of either visceral or
subcutaneous ASCs (Figure 3B). By contrast, visceral
ASCs affected hardly and subcutaneous ASCs even
inhibited proliferation of the highly metastatic breast
cancer cells MDA-MB-231 (Figure 3C). The stimulatory
effect of ASCs on MCF-7 was further underscored by an
increase in the mitotic marker phosphorylated histone
H3 (pHH3, S10) after five days of direct co-culture with
visceral or subcutaneous ASCs (Figure 3D). To further
underscore these data, Ruby-H2B labelled MCF-7 cells
and EGFP-H2B marked MDA-MB-231 cells were directly
co-cultured with ASCs for up to five days and the viability
of the fluorescent cells were evaluated by flow cytometry.
Compared to control Ruby-H2B MCF-7 cells, the cell
number of co-cultured Ruby-H2B MCF-7 with visceral
ASCs and subcutaneous ASCs was increased by 30%
and 13%, respectively (Figure 3E). Again, proliferation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of EGFP-H2B MDA-MB-231 cells was even slightly
reduced in the presence of visceral or subcutaneous
ASCs (Figure S2D). These different outcomes between
MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells might be ascribed to
their individual proliferation pattern associated with their
receptor composition: MDA-MB-231 cells proliferate
autonomously representing a highly invasive cell type with
a triple negative composition for estrogen receptor (ER),
progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2 (HER2), whereas less malignant MCF-7
cells, resistant to apoptosis due to the lack of caspase-3,
proliferate upon stimulation with expression for all ER,
PR and HER2 [16].
To study the impact of the direct co-culturing on
the mRNA expression, total RNA was isolated from cocultured and sorted Ruby-H2B MCF-7 cells and 12 genes
related to the cell cycle were analyzed. Five of them were
increased compared to that in control Ruby-H2B MCF7 cells (Figure 3F) whereas the remaining 7 genes p21,

and cyclin B1 were hardly affected (data not shown). The
mRNA of Aurora B and Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), two
important mitotic genes, increased slightly in Ruby-H2B
MCF-7 cells co-cultured with visceral ASCs (Figure 3F).

More interestingly, the mRNA expression level of the
transcription suppressor B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) and
cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 were highly increased (Figure
3F). All three are known to be involved in multiple cellular

processes like cell cycle regulation, proliferation, tumor
initiation and progression [17-19].

1st to 3rd row, lane 4 and 5), comparable to MCF-7 control
cells (Figure 4B, 1st to 3rd row, lane 2).
Nevertheless, subcutaneous ASCs were able
to induce EMT in MCF-7 after 21 days of indirect coculture, displayed by a changed morphology, increased
vimentin and decreased E-cadherin expression (Figure
S3D). The observation, subcutaneous ASCs induced
EMT with a significantly decreased rate and a longer time
period in MCF-7 cells (Figure S3E), might be explained
by reduced secretion of the most detected cytokines from
subcutaneous ASCs compared to visceral ASCs (Figure
2A).
It is well known that EMT reduces very often
cell proliferation [20-22]. To functionally corroborate
the EMT phenotype induced by ASCs, we performed
cell viability assays. MCF-7 control cells and MCF-7
cells indirectly co-cultured with ASCs for 14 days were
seeded into a 96-well plate for up to 96 h. While MCF7 cells indirectly co-cultured with visceral ASCs showed
a reduced proliferation rate of 33.5%, MCF-7 indirectly
incubated with subcutaneous ASCs displayed a reduction
of 16.2% at 96 h compared to MCF-7 control cells (Figure
4C). Collectively, the data imply that the indirect coculture with ASCs induces EMT in MCF-7 cells and this
transition is reversible associated with significant changes
in their cytoskeleton composition, morphological changes
and a reduced cell proliferation.

ASCs induce the epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition by indirect co-culturing
To address if ASCs could also indirectly influence
cancer cells, an indirect co-culture experiment was
performed in a transwell system. Breast cancer cells and
ASCs were seeded in individual chambers of a transwell
system for up to 14 days, where they had no direct cellcell contact but they were able to exchange their media
and secreted factors. The morphology of MCF-7 cells was
visualized at indicated time points and the first spindlelike cell shape was observed after 4 days of indirect
co-culturing (Figure S3A). During 14 days of indirect
co-culture most MCF-7 cells lost their characteristic
epithelial morphology with apical-basal polarity and
gained a mesenchymal phenotype with spindle-shaped
morphology (Figure S3A, day 7 to day 14), a process
referred to as the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT). To test if EMT is reversible, mesenchymal-like
MCF-7 cells were then cultured alone without ASCs and
the cell morphology was monitored at indicated time
points. Interestingly, a timely decrease in mesenchymallike and an increase in epithelial-like MCF-7 cells were
observed (Figure S3B). To underscore this observation,
cells were stained for confocal microscopy. Indeed, the
analysis revealed a membrane and cytoplasmic distributed
expression of N-cadherin and vimentin in MCF-7 cells
co-cultured with visceral ASCs for 14 days (Figure 4A,
3rd and 4th panel). E-cadherin was still detectable above
the background levels in these cells, but disappeared
from the plasma membrane with a diffuse distribution
in the cytoplasm (Figure 4A, 3rd and 4th panel). A similar
morphologic change and expression of vimentin and
E-cadherin were also observed in MCF-10A cells after
incubation with visceral ASCs (Figure S3C). In contrast,
MCF-7 control cells as well as MCF-7 cells co-cultured
with subcutaneous ASCs for 14 days still displayed a
strong expression of E-cadherin at the membrane and
in the cytoplasm, with nearly no detectable N-cadherin
and vimentin (Figure 4A, 1st and 2nd panel and 5th and
6th panel). To further corroborate these results, cells
were harvested at indicated time points for Western blot
analysis. MCF-7 cells indirectly co-cultured with visceral
ASCs were demonstrative for mesenchymal cell markers,
with high expression levels of fibronectin, N-cadherin and
vimentin (Figure 4B, 1st and 2nd row, and 4th row, lane 3),
as observed in ASCs (Figure 4B, 1st and 2nd row, and 4th
row, lane 6 and 7), and with losing E-cadherin (Figure 4B,
3rd row, lane 3). Also the reversibility of this process could
be observed in mesenchymal-like MCF-7 cells cultured
alone for 14 and 21 days, with a decrease in fibronectin
and N-cadherin and an increase in E-cadherin (Figure 4B,

The induced EMT is triggered by multiple
signaling cascades in MCF-7 cells
Numerous cytokines and chemokines have been
reported to be involved in the EMT process of cancer
cells via multiple signaling pathways [23]. To address this
issue, we measured at first the mRNA levels of several
cytokine genes in MCF-7 cells after co-culture with
visceral ASCs. The gene expression is demonstrated by
ΔCt value, which is reversely related to the amount of
target mRNA. Interestingly, co-cultured MCF-7 cells
showed a remarkable upregulation of IL-6, IL-8 and IL10 mRNA compared to MCF-7 control cells (Figure 5A).
The cyclin B1 mRNA level was slightly reduced in the
ASC co-cultured MCF-7 cells reflecting the reduced cell
proliferation of EMT cells (Figure 5A). Of note, the gene
expression of the transcription suppressor BCL6 was
also increased (Figure 5A). To look closely at EMT, we
performed further Western blot analysis with lysates from
control MCF-7 cells, ASC co-cultured MCF-7 cells and
MCF-7 cells exposed to hypoxia (2% O2), the late was
taken as an EMT positive control. Interestingly, compared
to control MCF-7 cells, visceral ASC co-cultured MCF-7
cells displayed an increase in transcription factors Snail,
Slug and STAT3 associated with enhanced IL-6 (Figure
5B and 5C). Moreover, an activation of the phospho-AKT
(p-AKT), p-ERK1/2 and p-FAK was also observed (Figure

To further elucidate which of these pathways is
important for the induction of EMT, MCF-7 cells were
co-cultured with visceral ASCs for 20 days in the presence
of low concentrations of Wortmannin (50 nM), a potent
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor [24], or
PD98059 (25 µM) inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein

kinase (MAPK) family [25]. Wortmannin blocked the
EMT induction in MCF-7 co-cultured with visceral ASCs
by displaying no increase in the expression of vimentin,
p-AKT and p-STAT3 compared to MCF-7 control cells
(Figure 5D, lane 1 and 3), indicating the activation of
PI3K pathway is essential for the EMT process. On the
other hand, the inhibition of the MAPK pathway with

PD98059 hardly affected the EMT induction evidenced by
increased vimentin, p-AKT and p-STAT3, and decreased
E-cadherin (Figure 5D, lane 2 and 4). To corroborate
these results, immunofluorescence staining was carried
out. While 51% of visceral ASCs co-cultured with MCF-7
cells were positive for the mesenchymal marker vimentin,
only few of these cells expressed vimentin in the presence
of Wortmannin (Figure 5E). Again, the MAPK inhibitor
PD98059 was not able to affect the EMT process in MCF7 cells co-cultured with visceral ASCs showing increased
vimentin expression (Figure 5E). These data provide
evidence that EMT of MCF-7 cells induced by ASCs is
mediated by multiple pathways, yet predominantly by the
PI3K pathway known to be activated by IL-6 and IL-8
[23], which are highly secreted by ASCs (Figure 2A).

Indirect co-culture with ASCs

growth, metastasis and drug resistance in breast cancer
cells [28, 29]. Indeed, the number of CD90 and CD73
positive stained MCF-7 cells was increased by 16% and
60%, respectively, after co-culture with visceral ASCs,
compared to MCF-7 control cells (Figure 6G). These
results further support the notion that ASCs could change
relatively differentiated MCF-7 into more progenitor state
conferring the malignant properties.

ASC signaling confers resistance to Plk1
inhibitors in MCF-7 cells
EMT is linked to drug resistance and poor prognosis
for patients [30]. Plk1 is one of the most promising targets
for molecular cancer treatment and its inhibitors block
efficiently proliferation of various cancer cells including
MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells [31, 32]. We wondered
if the EMT induction renders MCF-7 resistant to Plk1
inhibitors. MCF-7 cells, mesenchymal-like MCF-7 cells
induced by co-culturing with visceral ASCs, and visceral
ASCs were subjected to Plk1 inhibitors BI 2536, BI 6727
and Poloxin, and the cell viability and the mitotic index
were examined. Compared to control MCF-7 cells (Figure
7A), mesenchymal-like MCF-7 cells were obviously
resistant to BI 2536 and BI 6727 by showing no significant
proliferative inhibition (Figure 7B). Interestingly, Poloxin,
an inhibitor targeting the polo-box binding domain of
Plk1, displayed an inhibitory effect on those cells (Figure
7B), which requires further investigation. As expected,
visceral ASCs responded hardly to Plk1 inhibitors (Figure
7C). Treated cells were further stained for mesenchymal
marker vimentin and the mitotic marker pHH3 (S10) for
microscopy. Compared to control MCF-7 cells (Figure 7D,
upper panel), the pHH3 (S10) positive cells were clearly
reduced in ASC co-cultured MCF-7 cells (Figure 7D,
lower panel), which were vimentin positive (Figure 7D,
lower panel) indicating their mesenchymal-like phenotype.
Further evaluation corroborated a strong reduction of the
pHH3(S10) staining in mesenchymal-like MCF-7 cells
upon BI compound treatment (Figure 7E). These results
point to the notion that MCF-7 cells co-cultured with
ASCs acquire resistance to Plk1 inhibitors BI 2536 and
BI 6727, likely obtained by the changed cytoskeleton
composition and decreased proliferation rate [23].

We were then interested in the invasive property
of breast cancer cells co-cultured with ASCs. A woundhealing/migration assay was performed with different cell
lines indirectly co-cultured with ASCs. After co-culturing
with visceral ASCs, breast cancer cells MCF-7 and MDAMB-231, together with normal mammary epithelia cells
MCF-10A and fibroblasts, displayed a significantly
increased wound healing capacity compared to control
cells (Figure 6A-6D and Figure S4A-S4D). In the context
of co-culturing with subcutaneous ASCs, intriguingly,
non-tumorigenic cell lines like MCF-10A and fibroblasts
showed a slightly increased wound healing capacity,
whereas tumorigenic MCF-7 cells and metastatic MDAMB-231 cells exhibited a slower migration rate compared
to control cells (Figure 6A-6D and Figure S2A-S2D). To
examine the invasive feature of breast cancer cells, ASC
co-cultured cells were used for a well-established invasion
assay [26]. As expected, MCF-7 control cells were not
able to invade the matrigel layer of the invasion chamber,
whereas MCF-7 co-cultured with visceral ASCs displayed
a highly significant increase in the number of invading
cells (Figure 6E and 6F). Intriguingly, visceral ASCs
stimulated hardly the invasive capability of MDA-MB-231
cells, which are already highly invasive metastatic breast
cancer cells (Figure 6E and 6F). Thus, the data imply that
ASCs promote cell migration of different cell lines and
facilitates the invasion mainly in non/less invasive breast
cancer lines such as MCF-7.
The recently emerged concept of cancer stem cells
as a cell state not as a cell type [27] led to the question, if
the indirect co-culture with ASCs is sufficient to induce
the expression of mesenchymal stem cell markers in
MCF-7 cells. To answer this question, visceral ASC cocultured MCF-7 cells were measured by flow cytometry
for mesenchymal stem cell markers CD90 and CD73,
which have been shown to be correlated with tumor

DISCUSSION
The tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role
in cancer development and progression [33]. To ensure
the safety usage of ASCs in new regenerative therapy, it
is fundamental to understand the molecular interactions
between ASCs and cancer cells. A great body of work
has been done, which has shed light on this issue and
also raised the safety concerns [8-10, 34-38]. In the
current study, we have isolated ASCs from subcutaneous
34486

and visceral adipose tissues of the same donor and
systematically characterized the features of these paired
ASCs and addressed their impact on breast cancer cells.
We show that both subcutaneous and visceral ASCs
express the cell surface markers characteristic of the
mesenchymal stem cells. They display however distinct
cell morphology in culture, at least in the early passages:
ASCs from subcutaneous adipose tissues incline to be
fibroblastic-like, whereas their counterparts from visceral

adipose tissues tend to be “epithelial”-like. Moreover,
visceral ASCs are more competent of secreting soluble
factors, differentiating into other cell types and impact
more strongly on other cells, whereas subcutaneous ASCs
are more capable of homing toward breast cancer cells.
The differences between subcutaneous ASCs and visceral
ASCs could be ascribed to their different original sources
[39] and varied surroundings. In particular, the surrounded
adipocytes, namely the adipocytes in subcutaneous

and in visceral adipose tissue, exert definitely distinct
physiological functions [40]. The data might imply diverse
roles of these ASCs in vivo: subcutaneous ASCs could be
more mobile functioning in far organs and places, whereas
visceral ASCs could work more locally in near areas.
Despite differing in time and in efficiency, nevertheless,
both ASCs differentiate into other cells types, home
toward cancer cells and establish direct cell-cell contacts.
Additionally, both ASCs secret various factors involved
in autocrine and paracrine regulation and linked to tumor
initiation, growth and metastasis [41].
Furthermore, we show that, in a direct co-culture
manner, visceral ASCs promote proliferation of the low
malignant breast cancer line MCF-7, but hardly affect the
cell viability of the invasive breast cancer cell line MDAMB-231. Compared to visceral ASCs, subcutaneous
ASCs are much less competent to stimulate proliferation
of MCF-7 cells and even weakly inhibit expansion of
MDA-MB-231 cells. Interestingly, both ASCs impact
also slightly proliferation of normal mammary epithelial
cells MCF-10A. The reduced effect of subcutaneous ASCs
might be explained by a reduced expression of various
cytokines like IL-6 and IL-8 known to be involved in
breast cancer proliferation [42, 43]. The immovableness
of MDA-MB-231 cells could be due to their receptor
composition, the negative expression of ER, PR and HER2
[16], in line with the notion that triple negative breast
cancer cells respond differently to Notch, Hedgehog,
Wnt/β-catenin and TGFβ signaling pathways [44], which
are activated by ASCs [45, 46]. Furthermore, direct cellcell incubation induces an upregulation of mitotic genes
Aurora B and Plk1, cytokine genes IL-6 and IL-8 and
the oncogene BCL6 known for their tumor promoting
functions [17, 42, 47]. Intriguingly, indirect incubation
via a transwell system seems to be inefficient to promote
proliferation, indicating that a direct cell-cell contact,
possibly combined with the extracellular matrix associated
growth factors, is required for an effective proliferation.
Moreover, our results reveal that, despite varied
capability, both types of ASCs are able to induce EMT
in breast cancer cells by indirect co-culturing. This
process is illustrated by a changed morphology, altered
cytoskeleton composition and a reduced proliferation
rate. Along with the modification of the cytoskeleton, the
mRNA levels of BCL6, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 are highly
increased, which are all well documented to induce EMT
by multiple pathways in diverse cell lines [47-50]. Of
note, we show that BCL6, a crucial player involved in
B cell-lymphoma [51], is increased in MCF-7 cells upon
direct co-incubation with ASCs promoting proliferation,
as described above, and upon indirect co-culture in a
transwell system with ASCs facilitating EMT in MCF7 cells. In line with previous observation [52], our data
highlight that BCL6 is pivotal in progression of breast
cancer cells stimulated by ASCs. Furthermore, Western
blot analyses with lysates from mesenchymal-like MCFwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

7 cells display increased activation of the PI3K/AKT,
ERK1/2 and p-FAK pathways, together with enhanced
expression of the transcription factors Snail, Slug and
STAT3, also known as key players in the EMT process
[53]. The results from treatment with kinase inhibitors
suggest that the PI3K/AKT pathway is required for the
EMT induced by ASCs, whereas the MAPK pathway
seems to be dispensable for this process unlike reported
for human lens epithelial cells or ovarian cancer cells
[54, 55]. Consequently, the EMT-like MCF-7 cells show
a reinforced migration and invasion potential, and confer
resistance to Plk1 inhibitors BI 2536 and BI 6727, in
accordance with previous reports showing resistance to
other chemotherapeutic drugs [56]. Along with EMT,
MCF-7 cells express high levels of CD73 and CD90,
two cell surface markers of mesenchymal stem cells,
supporting the correlation between EMT and stemness
[57]. Our results also suggest that low malignant breast
cancer lines such as MCF-7 will be strongly impacted
by ASCs, which enforce them into a more aggressive
phenotype. In addition, subcutaneous ASCs, isolated from
donors undergoing cesarean section, appear to be less
competent in this study regarding their ability to promote
proliferation and induce EMT in breast cancer cells. It has
been reported that the reproductive state of donors hardly
impacted the features of ASCs [58], it is still conceivable
that various alterations in the pregnancy, like hormones,
growth factors and metabolism, could affect ASCs and
subsequently change their abilities. Further investigations
are required to address this issue.
In summary, we demonstrate pro-tumorigenic
effects of paired visceral and subcutaneous ASCs on
proliferation, migration and invasion behavior of various
cancer-derived cell lines. The interactions of ASCs with
breast cancer cells, via direct cell-cell communication
or indirect connection by secreting various cytokines,
chemokines and growth factors, increase the expression
of diverse cytokines, transcription factors and cell-surface
proteins, induce EMT in breast cancer cells via activating
multiple signaling pathways and render them resistant
to Plk1 inhibition. More preclinical investigations are
warranted to clarify these pro-tumorigenic effects of ASCs
in more molecular depth. In parallel, more clinical studies
with prolonged follow-up are required to address cancer
recurrence in patients treated with ASC-enriched fat grafts.

Visceral (omental) and subcutaneous (abdominal) adipose
tissues were taken from women undergoing cesarean
section. ASCs were isolated as described [11] with
modifications. In brief, obtained visceral and subcutaneous
adipose tissues were immediately washed, minced to small
pieces, and digested with 1 mg/ml collagenase type I for
1 h at 37°C. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 700
g for 10 min and the remaining blood cells were lysed by
addition of red blood cell lysis buffer (155 mM NH4Cl,
10 mM KHCO3, and 0.1 mM EDTA) for 10 min at 37°C.
To remove the lysis buffer cells were centrifuged at 700
g for 10 min and filtered through a 100-m mesh filter to
remove undigested adipose tissue. The remaining cells
were centrifuged, seeded onto 6-cm cell cultures plates in
DMEM containing 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 g/
ml streptomycin, 100 U/ml penicillin, 2 mM l-glutamine,
and 1 g/ml amphotericin-B and cultured under standard
cell culture conditions. After 24 h, non-adherent cells were
removed and the remaining cells were washed, cultured
and expanded. Early passages (P2 to P5) of isolated ASCs
were used for experiments.
To induce adipogenic differentiation, cells were
cultured with StemMACSTM AdipoDiff Media (Miltenyi
Biotec, Gladbach) for 14 days. Cells were then fixed
and stained for oil red O and adiponectin characteristic
of adipocytes. For osteogenic differentiation, ASCs were
incubated in StemMACSTM OsteoDiff Media (Miltenyi
Biotec) for 21 days, fixed and stained with 2% Alizarin
Red S (pH 4.2) to visualize calcific deposition by cells of
an osteogenic lineage. For neurogenic differentiation, cells
were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5 mM KCl, 2
µM valproic acid, 10 µM forskolin, 1 µM hydrocortisone,
5 µg/ml insulin, 0.5% ethanol and 200 µM butylated
hydroxyanisole for 21 days, and cells were stained for
class III beta-tubulin and doublecortin.

indicated time points. Cellular movement toward other
migration front was evaluated using the AxioVision
SE64 Re. 4.9 software (Zeiss). The experiments were
independently performed three times.
For invasion assay, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
cells were indirectly co-cultured with visceral ASCs in a
transwell chamber for at least 14 days. Cells were then
seeded in 24-well transwell matrigel chambers according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (Cell Biolabs Inc, San
Diego) and as previously reported [26]. Briefly, cells
(MDA-MB-231, 7.5 x 104; MCF-7, 12 x 104) were seeded
into the upper chamber of the transwell in 500 µl serumfree medium and the lower chamber was filled with 750
µl serum-free medium. After 12 h the medium of both
chambers was discarded and the invasion assay was started
by adding medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for
the next 24 h. Cells were fixed with ethanol and stained
with DAPI. Invaded cells were counted with a microscope.
The experiments were independently performed three
times.

Cell proliferation and flow cytometry
Cell proliferation assays were performed by
using Cell Titer-Blue® Cell Viability Assay (Promega,
Mannheim) as described [32]. The ratio 1:5 between
ASCs and cancer cells was used for direct co-culture
experiments. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were stably
transfected with Ruby-H2B or EGFP-H2B and selected
with geneticin (Sigma-Aldrich). The stable cell lines
were verified by flow cytometry. Both cell lines were cocultured with ASCs (5:1 ratio) in a 6-cm culture dish. After
five days, cells were analyzed using a FACSCaliburTM
(BD Bioscience, Heidelberg). The percentages of EGFP
or Ruby positive cancer cells were determined with BD
CellQuestTM Pro software (BD Bioscience).
To evaluate the mitotic fraction, MCF-7 cells and
MCF-7 cells indirectly co-cultivated with visceral ASCs
for 14 days, were seeded into slide flask chambers. After 8
h the cells were treated with 50 nM BI 2536 or 50 nM BI
6727 for 48 h. Cells were stained for phospho-histone H3
(pHH3, S10). Five pictures of each slide flask were taken
and the experiments were performed in triplicate. The
percentage of positive pHH3 (S10) cells were evaluated
using the AxioVision SE64 Re. 4.9 software (Zeiss).

RNA extraction and real-time PCR
Total RNAs of ASCs and cancer cells were extracted
with RNeasy kits with column DNase digestion according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (QIAGEN, Hilden).
Reverse transcription was performed using High-Capacity
cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems,
Darmstadt) as instructed. The probes for Aurora A,
Aurora B, BCL6, cyclin B1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, p21 and
Plk1 were obtained from Applied Biosystems. Real-time
PCR was performed with a StepOnePlus Real-time PCR
System (Applied Biosystems). The data were analyzed
using StepOne Software v.2.3 (Applied Biosystems) as
described previously [60, 64] with two methods. First is
the comparative Ct method: the relative quantity of target
gene expression is determined by comparing a reference
sample and an endogenous control to the target sample.
This method displays the gene expression as ΔCt value,
which is normalized to endogenous GAPDH and is
reversely related to the amount of target mRNA. Second
is the standard curve method which uses standards to
determine the absolute quantity of target gene expression.

Migration, invasion and attraction assay
Cell migration assays were performed
with culture-inserts from ibidi (Martinsried).
Culture-inserts (cell free gap of 500 µm) were placed in a
6-cm culture dish and both wells of each insert were filled
with cell suspension. MCF-7 (6.5 x 104), MDA-MB-231
(5.5 x 104), fibroblasts (6.5 x 104) and MCF-10A (5 x
104) cells were seeded in each well of the culture-inserts,
which were surrounded by visceral or subcutaneous ASCs.
Culture-inserts were gently removed after at least 8 h. The
cells were acquired and imaged at indicated time points
with bright-field images. Four pictures of each insert were
taken and the experiments were performed in triplicate.
The open area was measured using the AxioVision SE64
Re. 4.9 software (Zeiss).
For attraction assay, cells were placed in a 6-cm
culture dish and one well of each insert was filled with cell
suspensions either with visceral or subcutaneous ASCs
(5.5 x 104) or with the investigated cells (MCF-7, MDAwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Statistical analysis
Student’s t-test (two tailed and paired or
homoscedastic) was used to evaluate the significance
of difference between different groups. Difference was
considered as statistically significant when p < 0.05.
