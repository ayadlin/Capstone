BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare 2 weekly docetaxel-based regimens as first-line treatments for advanced gastric cancer and to investigate the expression of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine
(SPARC) and its abilities to predict treatment-related clinical outcomes. METHODS: Patients were randomly selected
to receive 3 weekly cycles of docetaxel (35 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8) plus S-1 (35 mg/m2 each twice daily on days 1-14)
(DS), or docetaxel plus cisplatin (35 mg/m2 each on days 1 and 8) (DC). Endpoints included overall response rate
(primary), survival, toxicity, and quality of life (secondary). SPARC expression in prechemotherapy specimens of primary gastric tumors was evaluated via immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS: Eighty patients were enrolled in the
study. Confirmed overall response rates were 46% (95% confidence interval, 30%-62%) for DS and 24% (95% confidence interval, 11%-38%) for DC via intent-to-treat analysis. Median progression-free survival was 7.3 and 4.9 months
and overall survival was 16.0 and 8.3 months for DS and DC, respectively. The most common grade 3 toxicity was
neutropenia. Grade 3 mucositis (18%) and hand-foot syndrome (8%) were the toxicities most associated with DS,
whereas anorexia (20%) and lethargy (20%) were more common with DC. High SPARC expression was related to
early progression (hazard ratio, 3.67; P ¼ .042) and poor overall survival (hazard ratio, 2.01; P ¼ .010) in docetaxel
chemotherapy on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes in this study favored DS over DC for further
phase 3 study. The findings suggest that split-dose weekly docetaxel alleviates hematological toxicity without compromising efficacy, and that SPARC expression may help individualize therapy in advanced gastric cancer. Cancer

Randomized studies of advanced gastric cancer (AGC) reveal the benefits of combination chemotherapy for survival and quality of life, but a globally accepted standard regimen has not been established. Old triplet regimens have been
rapidly replaced by newer drugs, including taxanes, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin, that are more effective and better tolerated
by patients. Docetaxel was the first of these drugs to be confirmed in prospective studies, and phase 2 trials of docetaxel
plus cisplatin (DC) have shown promising efficacy.1,2 Two recent randomized studies have suggested that combining
docetaxel with fluorouracil and cisplatin (DCF) increases survival, response, and clinical benefits.3,4 However, this regimen consistently produces high rates of neutropenia and nonhematological toxicity, underscoring the value of careful
patient selection and comprehensive monitoring.3,4 Therefore, dose optimization and selection of a combination partner
are emerging questions in the clinical application of docetaxel.

Phase 2 Study of Docetaxel Combinations/Jeung et al

S-1 is one of the preferred agents for the treatment
of gastric cancer in Asia. Recent randomized trials yielded
encouraging results for S-1-containing doublets.5-7 Docetaxel showed synergism with S-1 in vitro, and the response
rate was 46%-67% in several phase 2 trials.9-11 Based on
these findings, we designed a randomized phase 2 study to
determine whether S-1 or cisplatin shows greater promise
as a combination partner of docetaxel for a subsequent
phase 3 study. We adopted a weekly docetaxel regimen to
assess whether split administration improves drug tolerability and tested the predictive values of biomarkers for
treatment-related outcomes.
A variety of human malignancies, including gastric
cancer, overexpress secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), and high SPARC expression in the primary tumor is correlated with metastasis and poor
prognosis.12,13 SP/ mice exhibit increased sensitivity to
cisplatin, and SPARC is known to interact with tubulin
during development. These findings may indicate
SPARC’s role in mitosis and led us to select SPARC as a
candidate marker for docetaxel treatment.14,15

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility
Inclusion criteria were histologically confirmed gastric adenocarcinoma, recurrent or metastatic disease, age 18
years, performance score 2 by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group criteria, no prior chemotherapy for
advanced disease (adjuvant chemotherapy completed 6
months before enrollment), 1 measurable lesion, and
adequate organ function. The latter was defined as a neutrophil count 1500/lL, platelet count 100,000/lL,
serum creatinine level 1.5 mg/dL, total bilirubin level
1.25 (or 1.5)  upper limit of normal, and serum transaminase levels 2.5 (or 5.0)  upper limit of normal in
the absence (or presence) of liver metastasis. Patients were
excluded if they had concurrent active malignancy, brain
metastasis, or uncontrolled comorbidity. The institutional
ethics committee approved the trial, and all patients gave
written informed consent.
Treatment Schedule
Patients were randomly assigned to receive 3 weekly cycles
of docetaxel (35 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8) plus S-1 (35 mg/
m2 each twice daily on days 1-14) (DS), or docetaxel plus
cisplatin (35 mg/m2 each on days 1 and 8) (DC). S-1 was
prescribed according to body surface area as previously
reported.16 Chemotherapy was administered until the

occurrence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity,
or patient withdrawal.
Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was
permitted not prophylatically but therapeutically in the
event of grade 4 and/or febrile neutropenia. The next
cycle was not started unless the neutrophil count exceeded
1500/lL and the platelet count exceeded 100,000/lL.
Day 8 treatment was skipped if any hematological toxicity
grade 2 (except anemia) or nonhematological toxicity
(except alopecia, nausea, and vomiting) occurred. If toxicity grade 3 occurred, the dose for the next cycle was
reduced according to a predetermined dose modification
plan. Patients were excluded if they required 4 weeks of
rest for recovery from toxicity or if they required a dose
reduction beyond the predetermined level.
Response and Toxicity Assessment
Baseline evaluations included medical history, physical examination, complete blood count with differential, serum
chemistry/electrolytes, and electrocardiography. Baseline
tumor measurements were performed at least 3 weeks
prior to treatment. During treatment, laboratory and
physical examinations were performed weekly. Toxicity
was evaluated weekly and graded according to the
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria
(version 3.0).
Tumor measurement was conducted every 2 cycles
according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors guidelines (version 1.0). All responses were confirmed by a panel of independent intramural radiologists.
Patients were considered response-assessable if they had
overt clinical or radiological evidence of early progressive
disease (PD) within the first 2 cycles, or if they had
received a minimum of 2 cycles of treatment with at least
1 tumor measurement.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry for SPARC was performed in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded primary gastric tumors
using the EnVision method.17 Briefly, 4-lm-thick tissue
sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated. After removal of endogenous peroxidase activity and retrieval of
antigen, the slides were incubated with a 1:50 dilution of
anti-SPARC monoclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories,
CA) at room temperature for 1 hour. The slides were then
incubated with EnVision detection system reagents
(Dako, CA) and stained using diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride/peroxidase reaction (Dako). Slides were
counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin (Sigma, CA)

and scored for SPARC expression using a weighted histoscore.18 Histoscores were calculated according to the following formula: (1 percentage of cells staining weakly
positive) þ (2 percentage of cells staining moderately
positive) þ (3 percentage of cells staining strongly
positive).
Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR).
Secondary endpoints included survival, safety, and biomarker implementation. We hypothesized that the ORR
for DS and DC would be 50% and 20%, respectively.
Using a 2-sided test and assuming a ¼ 0.05 and b ¼ 0.20
(80% power), 36 patients in each treatment arm who met
tumor response evaluation were acquired. Assuming a
10% dropout rate, the final number of patients was 40 per
treatment arm. The ORR was evaluated according to
both intent-to-treat and per-protocol analyses.
Treatment group differences in ORR were tested
using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenschel test. The KaplanMeier method was used to estimate the distribution of
time to events. Progression-free survival (PFS) was determined from the date of treatment to PD or death from
any cause. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the
date of treatment to death from any cause. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards model were used to
determine the contributions of clinico-pathological or biological factors to endpoints.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Eighty patients were recruited from July 2005 to April
2007. One DS patient was ineligible due to concomitant
malignancy. Four patients were excluded from efficacy
analysis after the first cycle (3 withdrew consent [all DC]
and 1 [DS] died of toxicity). Thus, the remaining 75
patients (DS, n ¼ 37; DC, n ¼ 38) were evaluated for
response. The baseline characteristics of the 2 groups were
well balanced (Table 1).
Sixty-three patients (79%) had metastatic disease,
and the other 17 patients had recurrent disease after curative resection. All patients had at least 1 site of distant metastasis at the time of accrual (median, 2.5; range, 1-6),
and the median size of measurable lesions was 18 mm
(range, 10-108 mm). The most common nonmeasurable
lesion was primary gastric mass (n ¼ 59), and computed
tomography scans revealed peritoneal seeding in 26
patients (33%).

Treatment Results
In total, 321 cycles of DS and 218 cycles of DC were
administered, with a median of 6 cycles for DS (range, 126) and 4 cycles for DC (range, 1-16). The median treatment duration was 24 weeks (range, 3-64 weeks) for DS
and 13 weeks for DC (range, 3-82 weeks). Dose reduction
was more common in DS than DC (61% vs 39%), but
the incidence within cycle 4 was more common with DC
(DS, 50%; DC, 81%, P ¼ .056). Reasons for dose reduction included neutropenia (n ¼ 21), nonhematological
toxicity (n ¼ 15), poor patient compliance (n ¼ 2), and
investigator discretion (n ¼ 2).
The incidence of toxicity-related dose delays by
cycle 4 was similar in both groups (DS, 26%; DC, 27%).
During the entire treatment period, more treatment
delays occurred in DS due to the longer treatment duration; total delays were 72 weeks for DS and 37 weeks for
DC, with a median of 1 week (range, 1-3 weeks) for both
groups. Treatment cessation due to unacceptable toxicity
and patient refusal occurred more frequently with DC
(DS, 10%; DC, 24%). Treatment cessation decided by
the investigator occurred mainly with DS, in cases of
treatment sufficient in duration without disease progression (12 cycles) where further benefit might not be
achieved without unacceptable toxicity.
Overall, the median relative dose intensity (RDI) of
docetaxel was 0.88 for DS (range, 0.57-1.04) and 0.94 for
DC (range, 0.47-1.03). The RDI of S-1 and cisplatin
were 0.91 (range, 0.54-1.06) and 0.94 for DC (range,
0.47-1.03), respectively. In DS, the planned RDI
was maintained until cycle 4, and then slowly declined
to 0.8, whereas the RDI in DC declined steeply after
cycle 2.
Efficacy and Survival
The confirmed ORR was 46% for DS (95% confidence
interval [CI], 30%-62%) and 24% for DC (95% CI,
11%-38%) by intent-to-treat analysis (P ¼ .041). Early
PD (defined as PD or clinical deterioration within the first
2 cycles of treatment) occurred in 7 (18%) DS patients
and 11 (27%) DC patients. Response duration was 8.6
months for DS and only 4.9 months for DC. On multivariate analysis, treatment arm (DS or DC) was the only
independent factor selected for response, with a hazard ratio (DS/DC) of 0.38 (95% CI, 0.15-0.97; P ¼ .044).
At the median follow-up duration of 10.2 months
(range, 0.4-37.5 months), 77 patients exhibited disease
progression, and 71 patients had expired. The median
PFS was 7.3 months for DS (95% CI, 5.3-9.3 months)

Toxicity
There were 2 treatment-related deaths with DS from febrile neutropenia and infection. The most common grade
3 hematological toxicity was neutropenia. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 4 DS patients (10%). The number of
granulocyte-colony stimulating factor injections was similar in both groups (8 DS patients; 11 DC patients).

2053

Original Article

multivariate analysis, SPARC expression remained in the
final model for OS along with treatment arm (DS vs DC).
High SPARC showed a hazard ratio for death of 2.01
(95% CI, 1.18-3.40; P ¼ .010) (Table 2).

Figure 1. Overall survival according to expression level of
secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is
shown.

Twenty-four DS patients and 16 DC patients had
nonhematological toxicity grade 3. The median time to
grade 3 nonhematological toxicity was longer for DS (4
cycles; range, 1-15 cycles) than for DC (1 cycle; range, 1-9
cycles). Eight DS patients (33%) experienced grade 3
toxicity within the first 2 cycles, compared with all but 2
DC patients (88%). Diarrhea, mucositis, and hand-andfoot syndrome were common in DS; however, all patients
recovered with conservative care. Anorexia and lethargy
were more common in DC patients. One DS patient
underwent gastrectomy after cycle 2 for intractable bleeding due to cancer progression.
Association of SPARC Expression With
Treatment Outcome
SPARC was mainly localized in the cytoplasm or membranes of cancer cells. Histoscores for SPARC expression
did not differ between treatment groups (P ¼ .877,
Mann-Whitney U test) or other clinico-pathological parameters (data not shown). Grouping patients as ‘‘high
SPARC’’ or ‘‘low SPARC’’ according to the median value
of histoscore revealed an association of high SPARC with
early PD (P ¼ .042). On logistic regression, high SPARC
expression was the only independent variable that predicted early PD (P ¼ .042), with a relative risk of 3.67
(95% CI, 1.05-12.86).
On univariate analysis, patients with high SPARC
had significantly shorter OS than patients with low
SPARC (7.5 vs 16.0 months, P ¼ .019) (Figure 1). On

DISCUSSION
When designing this study, we already knew the randomized phase 2 trial in which DCF gave a higher ORR than
DC.19 Nonetheless, we chose DC as a treatment arm
because it had similar OS to DCF but a more favorable
nonhematological toxicity profile. The other main consideration in study design was docetaxel dosage. Early
studies evaluated triweekly docetaxel at 85-100 mg/m2
combined with 75 mg/m2 cisplatin based on phase 1
results. Subsequent studies, however, consistently raised
concerns about toxicity, notably neutropenia.1,20,21 Preclinical studies have demonstrated that docetaxel modulates the intracellular metabolism of other drugs (5-FU
and cisplatin), which explains the mechanism underlying
the synergistic effect.22,23 Therefore, we hypothesized that
split-dose weekly administration of docetaxel is a rational
approach to procure dose intensity without increasing
toxicity. Even with the strict weekly follow-up of complete blood count mandated by the protocol, only 27% of
patients suffered grade 3 neutropenia, which is remarkable compared with previous data indicating that >80%
of DCF patients have grade 3 neutropenia.4,19 Therefore, we suggest that split-dose docetaxel offers a safer
approach than a triweekly schedule and that combination
with S-1 has high efficacy for gastric cancer. However, we
also found that this weekly strategy is yet to be justified
with cisplatin. For DC treatment, the toxicity profile
seems better compared with previous data, but it is possible that the efficacy was also compromised, leading to
decreased response and survival.
We observed that DS and DC had different toxicity
profiles in nonhematological toxicities. The major adverse
event of DS was mucocutaneous toxicity, and 8% of
patients suffered grade 3 hand-and-foot syndrome. This
toxicity profile is similar to weekly docetaxel plus capecitabine, which proved to be promising in gastric cancer, as
shown by some phase 2 trials.24,25 Although the incidence
is not high, this toxicity may be troublesome for patients.
Docetaxel-induced hand-and-foot syndrome is known to
be related to the cumulative dose and occur more frequently in a weekly schedule.26 Mucositis and nail
changes that advanced to onycholysis are also combined.

after cycle 4, may have clinical implications; it causes pain
and degrades quality of life enough to significantly delay
the next treatment cycle. Therefore, early detection and
symptomatic relief are essential for better application in
clinical practice.
Although survival is not a primary endpoint, the
remarkably long OS for PFS in DS patients is noteworthy.
This discrepancy between PFS and OS may reflect multiple factors: First, DS had twice the response duration as
DC, a higher disease control rate (80% vs 64%), and a
trend toward longer disease stabilization (7.8 vs 6.2
months; P ¼ .076). Second, survival may be partly influenced by the therapy that followed the study. More DS
patients were transferred to salvage chemotherapy (69%
vs 41%), and many of them received cisplatin (23%), a
generally favorable salvage treatment in AGC.27 Ad hoc
analysis showed that 23% of the DS patients who received
second-line treatment showed an objective response, compared with only 9% of DC patients. Third, inferior survival of DC patients possibly results from an altered
schedule of weekly DC administration rather than a triweekly schedule. Finally, the favorable response and survival of DS patients may be attributable to molecular
factors involved in drug metabolism or cell signaling.
Little is known about molecular biomarkers relevant
to gastric cancer. A recent phase 3 study validated erbB2
as a criterion for treatment individualization in gastric
cancer.28 However, the prevalence of erbB2 positivity is
low in gastric cancer,29 and only 1 patient in our study
showed erbB2 immunoreactivity. We hypothesized that
pooling information from multiple pathways might yield
a clearer picture of tumor behavior and potential sensitivity to therapy. We demonstrated that high protein expression of SPARC detected in primary gastric tumor helps to
predict early PD and poor survival, which may correspond
to primary resistance to docetaxel. The underlying mechanism between SPARC and chemosensitivity is currently
unknown, but some previous studies have shown that
SPARC protects cells from stress-induced apoptosis
through interaction with integrin b1 heterodimers that
enhance integrin-linked kinase activation and prosurvival
activity.13,30 Our study is only the first suggestion of an
association between SPARC expression and clinical outcome of docetaxel treatment, and this preliminary finding
awaits confirmation in larger study groups along with in
vitro experiments. SPARC expression should be prospectively evaluated as a stratification factor in a randomized
trial to determine whether it is truly predictive of benefit
or response to docetaxel or other chemotherapy.

2056

In conclusion, we favor DS over DC for further evaluation in terms of tumor response and survival. An Asian
phase 3 trial (JACCRO GC03) comparing S-1 plus docetaxel to S-1 monotherapy has completed accrual.31 This
trial could provide more information on the combination
of S-1 and docetaxel. However, the study design was different from ours (triweekly vs weekly treatment), and we
tried higher dose intensity of docetaxel (13 vs 23 mg/m2/
week). We think that the potency of S-1-based combinations shown in the SPIRITS trial justifies further testing
in future phase 3 trials.5 We support the use of weekly
docetaxel, and our results suggest that intratumoral
SPARC expression provides molecular insights into
patient survival and chemoresistance. A better understanding of the molecular signatures of cancer may lead to
more rational and predictable chemotherapies and expand
our ability to individualize the treatment of AGC.
