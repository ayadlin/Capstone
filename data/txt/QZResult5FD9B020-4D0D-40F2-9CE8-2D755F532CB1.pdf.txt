Abstract
Intrinsic resistance to agents targeting phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway is one of the major
challenges in cancer treatment with such agents. The objective of this study is to identify the genes or pathways
that can be targeted to overcome the resistance of non–small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) to the AKT inhibitor
MK2206, which is currently being evaluated in phase I and II clinical trials. Using a genome-wide siRNA library
screening and biologic characterization, we identiﬁed that inhibition of thioredoxin reductase-1 (TXNRD1), one
of the key antioxidant enzymes, with siRNAs or its inhibitor, auranoﬁn, sensitized NSCLC cells to MK2206
treatment in vitro and in vivo. We found that simultaneous inhibition of TXNRD1 and AKT pathways induced
robust reactive oxygen species production, which was involved in c-jun-NH2-kinase (JNK; MAPK8) activation
and cell apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that the synthetic lethality interaction between the TXNRD1 and AKT
pathways occurred through the KEAP1/NRF2 cellular antioxidant pathway. Finally, we found that synthetic
lethality induced by TXNRD1 and AKT inhibitors relied on wild-type KEAP1 function. Our study indicates
that targeting the interaction between AKT and TXNRD1 antioxidant pathways with MK2206 and auranoﬁn, a
U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drug, is a rational strategy to treat lung cancer and that KEAP1
mutation status may offer a predicative biomarker for such combination approaches. Cancer Res; 73(17); 5532–43.

Introduction
Previous studies have established the critical role of the
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway in cancer cell
growth and survival; therefore, strategies that target this
pathway have been developed and tested for cancer treatment,
including lung cancer (1). MK2206 (Merck, Inc.), a smallmolecule inhibitor that targets the AKT signaling pathway, is
currently being tested in phase I and II clinical trials and has
shown promising results in terms of tumor shrinkage, disease
stabilization, and patient tolerability in patients with advanced
solid tumor (2). We previously reported that a large subset of
human non–small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells do not
respond to MK2206 (3). We and others have also reported that
combination with other agents, such as AZD6244 (an inhibitor

of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase) and erlotinib [an
EGF receptor (EGFR) inhibitor], sensitized some lung cancer
cells to MK2206 (3, 4). Those ﬁndings indicate that identiﬁcation and inhibition of additional targets are needed to
improve the efﬁcacy of targeted therapeutic agents, such as
MK2206.
Thioredoxin reductase and thioredoxin (TXNRD1/TXN) is
one of the major thiol-dependent electron donor systems in
cells; it plays a critical role in regulating the cellular redox
environment and in a wide range of cellular activities, such as
maintenance of viability and proliferation (5). Preclinical studies indicated that auranoﬁn, an orally active gold compound
and a TXNRD1 inhibitor, induced apoptosis in cancer cells and
enhanced the antitumor activities of chemotherapeutic agents
(6–10). It is currently being tested in a phase II clinical trial for
treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (11), and was
recently repurposed as an orphan drug for human amebiasis
treatment (12). Other TXNRD1/TXN inhibitors, such as PG12,
have also been tested clinically in solid tumors (13, 14). Kelchlike ECH-associated protein (KEAP1) and nuclear factor-erythroid-derived-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathways is another
major cellular antioxidant pathways. Under normal conditions,
KEAP1 binds to NRF2 and promotes degradation by cullin3
(Cul3)-based E3 ligase system (15). Activated NRF2 due to
oxidative stress can stimulate multiple antioxidant molecules
by binding to antioxidant response elements (ARE; refs. 16, 17).
Loss-of-function mutations of KEAP1 have been reported in
many cancer types including NSCLC with frequency of about
19% (18–20). KEAP1 mutations cause constitutive activation of

Synthetic Lethal Interaction between AKT and TXNRD1

NRF2, which is associated with cancer progression, treatment
resistance, and poor patient survival (21–23).
Genome-wide siRNA library screening has been used to
identify targets or networks that can be targeted for cancer
therapy. siRNA library screening has also been used to identify
synthetic lethality loci with speciﬁc drugs (24–27). Using
genome-wide siRNA library screening and biochemical and
biologic methods, we found that inhibition TXNRD1 with
siRNAs or inhibitor, auranoﬁn sensitized lung cancer cells to
MK2206 in vitro and in vivo. Our study indicates that auranoﬁn,
a TXNRD1 inhibitor and clinically proven drug that has been
used to treat rheumatoid arthritis for 25 years, could be
repurposed for lung cancer therapy in combination with
MK2206.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
Human lung cancer cell lines HCC193, H1993, H460, H1299,
H2126, H292, H1648, H838, H1395, H23, H358, H1703, H1666,
and A549 were from the Hamon Center for Therapeutic
Oncology Research at The University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center (Dallas, TX). Cell lines were maintained in highglucose RPMI-1640 supplemented with 5% FBS and cultured at
37 C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 95%
air. Cell lines have been authenticated regularly with shorttandem repeat (STR) ﬁngerprinting method.
siRNA library screening
We used the NSCLC cell line HCC193 for genome-wide
siRNA screening, because it has a high level of p-AKT and the
IC50 for MK2206 is 10 mmol/L (3) The screening concentration
of MK2206 is 1 mmol/L, a dose that can sufﬁciently inhibit
phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) in vitro and in vivo (2, 3). The
screening was conducted using a Dharmacon siRNA siGENOME (Dharmacon) library containing 84,508 siRNAs with four
unique siRNA duplexes that target each of 21,127 unique
human genes. On day 1, 2,000 cells were reverse transfected
with 0.07 mL DharmaFECT 4 in a 384-well plate, to a ﬁnal
concentration of 40 nmol/L siRNA per well. MK2206 was added
on day 3 at a 1 mmol/L ﬁnal concentration. Cell growth was
analyzed on day 5 using the CellTiter Blue method (Promega).
Raw data were log2 transformed. Data were normalized using
16 negative controls in each plate. The t statistics were conducted to compare the signiﬁcant differences between the
values of siRNA transfection and the negative control and
siRNA transfection plus MK2206 treatment. P values were
obtained using computed t statistics. b-Uniform mixture
methods were used to account for multiple tests and estimate
the false discovery rate (FDR).
Proliferation assay
The drug treatment protocol was reported in our previous
publications (3, 28). In brief, 2,000 cells was plated in 96-well
plates and treated with the indicated doses of auranoﬁn (0–0.5
mmol/L), MK2206 (0–2.5 mmol/L), or both for 72 hours. A
sulforhodamine B assay (SRB) was conducted to determine
cell viability. IC50 values of auranoﬁn and MK2206 in each cell
line were calculated using Curve Expert 1.3 software and

www.aacrjournals.org

plotted in dose–response curves. Chou–Talalay method was
used to calculate the two-drug combination index (CI) using
CalcuSyn software (Biosoft; CI, 0.2–0.9, synergism; CI < 0.2,
strong synergism; ref. 29).
Western blot analysis
Whole-cell lysates were collected using radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) reagent. Western blot analysis was conducted with 40 mg of total cell proteins and antibodies against
phosphorylated-c-jun-NH2-kinase (p-JNK), JNK, PARP, p-AKT,
AKT (Cell Signaling Technology), KEAP1, NRF2 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), and TXNRD1 (Abcam).
Gene knockdown and overexpression
Cells were transfected in a 96- or 6-well plate with siRNAs (40
nmol/L) using DharmaFECT 4, and 48 hours posttransfection,
cells were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or MK2206
for additional 72 hours. For stable gene knockdown of KEAP1,
short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) in lentivirus plasmids were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, and lentiviruses were
packaged using a kit from System Biosciences. Cells were
infected with lentiviruses containing speciﬁc shRNAs, followed
by selection with puromycin (1 mg/mL) for 4 weeks. For overexpression of dominant-negative AKT (AKT-DN) or wild-type
KEAP1 (Dsred-KEAP1), plasmids of interest were transfected
into HCC193, H1993, and H460 cells, respectively, with Lipofectamine 2000 followed by selection with G418 (500 mg/mL)
for 4 weeks.
Measuring reactive oxygen species production
The reactive oxygen species (ROS) measurement method
was described in our previous publication (30). In brief, cells
(1  106/mL) were incubated in Hank's Balanced Saline Solution containing 50 mmol/L 20 ,70 -dichlorﬂuorescein-diacetate
(DCFHDA) for 30 minutes. The cell population ﬂuorescence is
proportional to the levels of intracellular ROS generated and
was measured using ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS;
Becton Dickinson) at 588 nm emission.
Real-time PCR
The NRF2 downstream molecules glutamate–cysteine ligase
catalytic (GCLC) subunit was analyzed using real-time PCR,
as described previously (28). The primers for GCLC are forward, 50 -ctgttgcaggaaggcattgat-30 and reverse, 50 -ttcaaacagtgtcagtgggtctct-30 . Primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) are, forward, 50 -atcccatcaccatcttccag30 and reverse, 50 -atgagtccttccacgatacc-30 .
Glutathione assay
Glutathione (GSH) levels were tested using the GSH Assay
Kit (Sigma). After the indicated treatments, GSH levels were
determined using the GSH-reductase recycling assay with 5,50 dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid; DNTB) as substrate in microtiter plates, following the manufacturer's instructions.
TXNRD1 activity assay
Cells (0.5  108) were washed with PBS and extracted with
CelLytic M. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000  g for 10

minutes, and supernatants were used as the enzyme sample.
Tumor tissues (from mice) were extracted with four volumes of
0.25 assay buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail using
a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. The samples were centrifuged
for 15 minutes at 10,000  g. TXNRD1 activity was measured
with a TXNRD1 activity assay kit (Sigma) using DNTB as a
substrate.
Animal experiments
Animal experiments were carried out according to the
approved protocol (10-11-11531) by The University of Texas
MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX) Institutional
Review Board and in accordance with the Guidelines for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the NIH
(Bethesda, MD). A total of 2  106 H1993 cells were inoculated subcutaneously into the right dorsal ﬂanks of nude
mice. Treatment started when tumors reached a mean
volume of approximately 40 mm3. Animals bearing xenograft
tumors derived from the H1993 cell line were randomly
assigned to four treatment groups, with 5 mice in each
group: (i) MK2206 only (25 mg/kg; by oral), (ii) auranoﬁn
only (5 mg/kg; by intraperitoneal), (iii) MK2206 (25 mg/kg)
and auranoﬁn (5 mg/kg), and (iv) solvent only (control).
Animals were treated daily, and tumor volumes were measured blindly every 3 days. The tumor volumes were calculated using the formula length  width2  0.52. Mice were
euthanized when their tumor volume was larger than 2,000
mm3. Mean tumor growth was analyzed using the Kruskal–
Wallis test for overall signiﬁcance among different treatment groups and Mann–Whitney U test for signiﬁcance
between two treatment groups (two-tailed). Kaplan–Meier
method was used to analyze the animal survival.
Examination of NRF2 subcellular localization
Immunoﬂuorescence staining was conducted to determine
the subcellular localization of NRF2 in H1993 cells, before and
after treatment as described previously (31). NRF2 subcellular
localization was also examined with enhanced GFP (EGFP)
fusion protein (32). Images were obtained under a Carl Zeiss
Deconvolution AxioVision 4 microscope (Carl Zeiss). Nuclear
and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared with hypotonic lysis
buffer (20 mmol/L Tris pH 7.5, 5 mmol/L MgCl2, 5 mmol/L
CaCl2, 1 mmol/L dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mmol/L EDTA, and
protease inhibitor cocktail). Cells were passed through 27gauge needle on ice for 30 times followed by centrifugation
at 250  g for 5 minutes at 4 C. The supernatant was used
as cytoplasmic fraction. The nuclear pellet was thoroughly
washed in PBS and nuclear protein was extracted with RIPA.
Luciferase reporter assay
Cells (2  104) were transfected with ARE-Luc plasmid
(provided by Dr. Donna Zhang, Arizona University, Tucson,
AZ) and a Renilla-luciferase control plasmid in a 12-well plate
using Lipofectamine 2000. Forty-eight hours after transfection,
cells were treated with DMSO or MK2206 (1 mmol/L) for 1, 3, 6,
or 24 hours. Cells were then collected for luciferase activity
assay. Luciferase activity was normalized using a Renillaluciferase control.

Statistical analysis
The t statistics were used to determine the signiﬁcant differences between the survival values of cells treated with
negative control siRNA, targeted siRNA, and targeted siRNA
plus MK2206. P values were obtained using computed t statistics. b-Uniform mixture methods were used to account for
multiple tests and estimate the FDR. The correlation between
KEAP1 mutation and sensitivity to MK2206 and auranoﬁn
was determined using the Fisher exact test with two-sided
P values at 95% conﬁdence interval. Online Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software was used to conduct a signaling pathway analysis. The signiﬁcance of the in vitro cell proliferation
between and within different treatment groups were determined using Student t test (two-tailed). The signiﬁcance of
the in vivo animal study data was determined using the
Kruskal–Wallis test for overall signiﬁcance among different
treatment groups and Mann–Whitney U test for signiﬁcance
between two treatment groups (two-tailed). Kaplan–Meier
method was used to analyze the animal survival.

Results
Synthetic lethality screening identiﬁed MK2206 synthetic
lethal hits
To identify gene candidates that could be targeted to
overcome the intrinsic resistance to MK2206 in NSCLC cells,
genome-wide siRNA screening was conducted with the
Dharmacon siRNA siGENOME library in the NSCLC cell line
HCC193. The FDR of 0.1 was used as the cutoff to deﬁne the
signiﬁcant hits. Using a P value of 0.007542048 and at least
50% of growth inhibition as the cutoff, we identiﬁed 156 hits.
We analyzed the signiﬁcant hits using Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis software and found that targets in the NF-kB,
autophagy, and cellular redox regulation pathways were
synthetically lethal with MK2206 (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Table S1). Using cell proliferation assay and siRNA
knockdown, we further validated the top 10 hits, including
TXNRD1, CFLAR, ATP5J, SLC9A10, and CLN10. The results
showed that knockdown of TXNRD1, CFLAR, SCLC9A10,
AHCYL1, and CLN10 sensitized both HCC193 and H1993
cells to 1 mmol/L MK2206 (Fig. 1B and C).
TXNRD1 knockdown sensitized cells to MK2206
treatment by inducing cell apoptosis
To determine whether TXNRD1 expression levels correlate
with the sensitivity to MK2206, we examined the TXNRD1 and
P-AKT expression in 4 MK2206-sensitive and 10 MK2206resistant NSCLC cell lines based on our previous published
data (3). We found that the expression levels of TXNRD1 are
low in all 4 MK2206-sensitive cell lines, whereas the expressions of TXNRD1 are signiﬁcantly higher in 7 of 10 resistant cell
lines (P < 0.01), and there is a correlation of TXNRD1 levels with
MK2206 resistance (r ¼ 0.66; Fig. 2A). Knockdown of TXNRD1
with three different siRNAs signiﬁcantly sensitized the HCC193
and H1993 cells (Fig. 2B and C). Cell apoptosis analysis by ﬂow
cytometry conﬁrmed that TXNRD1 knockdown combined
with MK2206 induced 10% to 30% apoptosis in HCC193 and
H1993 cells within 48 hours treatment, whereas no apoptosis
was induced in the cells treated with MK2206 or siRNA only

(Fig. 2D). PARP cleavage, an apoptosis marker, was also
observed in HCC193 and H1993 cells treated with TXNRD1
siRNA and MK2206 (Fig. 2E). Those results indicate that
TXNRD1 knockdown sensitizes NSCLC cells to AKT inhibition
by inducing cell apoptosis.
TXNRD1 inhibition with auranoﬁn sensitized cells to
MK2206 treatment in vitro and in vivo
To develop a treatment strategy that would be useful
clinically, we tested the combination of MK2206 and auranoﬁn,
a TXNRD1 inhibitor that is used for rheumatoid arthritis
treatment. Inhibition of TXNRD1 by different doses of auranoﬁn was ﬁrst conﬁrmed in HCC193 cells. Approximately, 80%
of TXNRD1 activity was inhibited by 0.1 mmol/L auranoﬁn (Fig.
3A), which is consistent with a previous report (33). At 0.1
mmol/L, auranoﬁn did not affect the viability of HCC193 and
H1993 cells as was shown in Fig. 3B. We used a dose of 0.1
mmol/L, which can inhibit TXNRD1 activity but not the cell
proliferation for the combination with MK2206. Combination
of MK2206 (1 or 3 mmol/L) and 0.1 mmol/L auranoﬁn induced
signiﬁcant growth inhibition in HCC193 and H1993 cells,
P < 0.01 (Fig. 3C). Liquid colonogenic assay further conﬁrmed
that combination of 0.1 mmol/L auranoﬁn and MK2206 signiﬁcantly reduced the colony formation in HCC193 and

www.aacrjournals.org

H1993 cells more than 80% compared with vehicle or each
single treatment alone (P < 0.01; Fig. 3D and E).
To determine the synthetic lethality induced by MK2206 and
auranoﬁn in vivo, xenograft tumors were established with
H1993 cells. Single-drug treatment with MK2206 or auranoﬁn
had no effect on tumor growth, but the combination signiﬁcantly inhibited tumor growth by 85% in reduction of tumor
volumes compared with each drug alone and 90% compared
with vehicle treatment (P ¼ 0.009 in all three comparisons).
Tumor growth inhibition by auranoﬁn (AUR) or MK2206 (MK)
alone was signiﬁcant as compared with vehicle only at a late
time point (day 28; AUR vs. vehicle, P ¼ 0.023; MK vs. vehicle,
P ¼ 0.047), but the tumor volume reduction was very minimal
(5%; Fig. 3F). This combination also signiﬁcantly prolonged
animal survival (median, 76 days) compared with vehicle
(median, 31 days) or single-drug treatment (median, 34 days
for both single treatments; P < 0.001; Fig. 3G). Signiﬁcant
inhibition of TXNRD1 by auranoﬁn and auranoﬁn and
MK2206 combination treatment was conﬁrmed in animal tumor tissues (Fig. 3H). Immunohistochemical staining indicated that p-AKT was inhibited in the tumor tissue treated
with MK2206 or the combination (Fig. 3I). These results
indicate that the combination of MK2206 and auranoﬁn
induces synthetic lethality in vivo.

Combination of auranoﬁn and MK2206 induced ROS
production, which mediated cell apoptosis
Because TXNRD1/TXN is one of the major cellular redox
regulatory systems that regulate cellular ROS, we hypothesized that combination of auranoﬁn and MK2206 may disrupt the cellular ROS balance. Indeed, we found that MK2206
alone induced ROS production in HCC193 and H1993 cells
by approximately 2-fold (Fig. 4A). The combination of auranoﬁn and MK2206 induced robust ROS production by 5-fold
(P < 0.05; Fig. 4B). To determine whether ROS induction is
essential for cell apoptosis induced by MK2206 and auranoﬁn, we treated cells with the ROS blocker nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA; 20 mmol/L). NDGA blocked the ROS
production in HCC193 and H1993 cells induced by the
combination (Fig. 4C), and reversed cell growth inhibition

in both HCC193 and H1993 cells (Fig. 4D). High level of ROS
can activate JNK pathway, which mediated cell apoptosis
(34). Indeed, we observed that combination of MK2206 and
auranoﬁn induced activation and PARP cleavage in H1993
and HCC193 cells (Fig. 4E). In addition, JNK activation and
PARP cleavage were blocked by ROS inhibitor NDGA (Fig.
4F). Those results indicated that combination of MK2206
and auranoﬁn induced ROS production, which mediated the
cell apoptosis.
Synthetic lethality induced by auranoﬁn and MK2206 is

In addition to TXNRD1, KEAP1/NRF2 is another major
cellular antioxidant system. Activated NRF2 translocates
to the nucleus and stimulates gene expression, such as

Luciferase reporter assay conﬁrmed that MK22006 inhibited GCLC promoter activity in HCC193 and H1993 cells
(Fig. 5B), indicating that the transcriptional activity of
NRF2 was inhibited by MK2206. Similarly, AKT-DN inhibited the transcriptional activity of NRF2 in HCC193 and
H1993 cells in a luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 5C and D),
and reduced NRF2 in the nuclear fractions of H1993
cells (Fig. 5E). Downregulation of GCLC mRNA was also
observed in both HCC193 and H1993 cells with a time
point–dependent manner (Fig. 5F). Because GCLC is a
rate-limiting molecule for GSH synthesis and GSH is the
major ROS scavenger, we further determined GSH production in cells treated with MK2206. The GSH level was
dramatically reduced in cells treated with MK2206 or
combination in HCC193 and H1993 cells (Fig. 5G). These
results indicate that MK2206 inhibited NRF2 transcriptio-

which subsequently reduced the GSH level and resulted in
ROS induction.
Synthetic lethality induced by MK2206 and auranoﬁn
depends on the genetic status of KEAP1
The above results indicate that the synthetic lethality
induced by MK2206 and auranoﬁn is mediated by ROS through
concurrent inhibition of NRF2 and TXNRD1, two major cellular
redox regulators. Because KEAP1 mutations cause constitutive
activation of NRF2 (38, 39), which we expect will not be
inhibited by MK2206 and thereby cause resistance to MK2206
and auranoﬁn combination. To test this hypothesis, we tested 5
additional KEAP1 wild-type cell lines (H1299, H23, H358, H292,
and H1703), 5 KEAP1-inactive mutant cell lines (H460, A549,
H2126, H1648, and H838), and 2 heterozygous mutant cell
lines (H1993 and H1395) for their sensitivity to treatment with

Synthetic Lethal Interaction between AKT and TXNRD1

GSH level was reduced by MK2206 or auranoﬁn–MK2206 combination. HCC193 and H1993 cells were treated with auranoﬁn, with or without different

MK2206, auranoﬁn, or both (18, 19). All KEAP1 wild-type cell
lines and heterozygous mutant cell lines were sensitive to
MK2206–auranoﬁn combination based on the IC50s of
MK2206, which are below or close to 1 mmol/L, a clinical
achievable dose (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Table S1). In
contrast, all KEAP1-mutant cells were not responsive to the
combination treatment (IC50s of MK2206 are more than the 3
mmol/L; Fig. 6B and Table 1). Statistical analysis revealed that
the cell lines' sensitivity to the combination of MK2206 and
auranoﬁn was signiﬁcantly correlated with the KEAP1 genetic
status (P ¼ 0.0013); no correlation was found between cell lines'
sensitivity and other mutations, including KRAS and LKB1
mutations (Table 1). Combination of auranoﬁn and MK2206
induced PARP cleavage in KEAP1 wild-type H1299 but not in

KEAP1-mutant H460 cell lines (Fig. 6C). Our results indicate
that synthetic lethality induced by MK2206 and auranoﬁn
depends on the genetic status of KEAP1. Using an EGFP–NRF2
fusion protein, we conﬁrmed that MK2206 induced NRF2
nuclear exclusion in KEAP1 wild-type H1299 cells but not in
KEAP1-mutant H460 cells (Fig. 6D). Moreover, MK2206 could
not inhibit NRF2 transcriptional activity by MK2206 in KEAP1mutant H460 and A549 cells in a Luciferase reporter assay (Fig.
6E). These results indicate that constitutive activation of
NRF2 due to inactive KEAP1 mutations cannot be overcome
by MK2206, thus causing resistance to the auranoﬁn and
MK2206 combination. To further conﬁrm this, KEAP1was
stably knocked down in KEAP1 wild-type H1299 cells (Fig.
6F, left). KEAP1 knockdown rendered cells' resistance to the

(Supplementary Fig. S1). These results conﬁrmed that synthetic lethality induced by MK2206 and auranoﬁn depends on a
functional KEAP1 gene. Collectively, our results indicate that
combination of auranoﬁn and MK2206 concurrently inhibits
TXNRD1 and NRF2, two major cellular antioxidant systems in
KEAP1 wild-type NSCLC cells, and induces ROS production
and cell apoptosis. A model of synthetic lethality induced by
TXNRD1 and AKT inhibitor was shown in Fig. 6H.

Discussion
In this study, we conducted a genome-wide siRNA library
screening with NSCLC cell line HCC193 to identify the genes
that can be targeted to sensitize the cells to AKT inhibitor
MK2206. This screening revealed 156 MK2206 synthetic
lethality hits (genes) with a FDR of 0.1, and a minimum
50% inhibition with combination of siRNA and 1 mmol/L
MK2206. Those hits include previously reported autophagyrelated genes, such as MAP1LC3C, cathepsin E, and cathepsin H, and components in the NF-kB pathway, such as
CASP8 and CFLAR. Inhibition of autophagy could sensitize
the cells to PI3K/AKT inhibitor treatment, which has been
reported previously (40, 41). Other hits include ATPases and
ATP synthase members, such as ATP5J and ATP6V1B1, both
of which are Hþ transporters. The synthetic lethality interaction between AKT and ATPases may occur through the
autophagy pathway as previous studies reported that the
vacuolar membrane Hþ-ATPase plays an important role in
autophagy (42, 43). The synthetic lethality hits are related to
different pathways, and many of those hits or pathways have
cross-talk (44, 45). This screening result conﬁrmed some
previous ﬁnding such as synthetic lethality induced by
autophagy and AKT inhibition but also revealed some novel
targets, such as TXNRD1, the molecules in redox balance,
suggesting potential synthetic lethal interactions between
the redox regulation system and AKT pathways.

www.aacrjournals.org

Previous studies indicate that other pathways, such as
KEAP1/NRF2, may compensate some functions of the
TXNRD1/TXN in cancer cells especially in vivo. In addition,
oncogenic pathways such as KRAS and NF-kB also regulate the
cellular redox balance through interaction with TXNRD1 or
KEAP1/NRF2 (46–49), suggesting complicated interaction
between oncogenic signaling pathways and cellular redox
balance system. Here, we showed that concurrent inhibition
of TXNRD1 and AKT pathways with auranoﬁn and MK2206,
respectively, induced robust ROS production and NSCLC cell
apoptosis in vitro and tumor growth inhibition in vivo, which
was not achieved by each drug alone. More importantly, NDGA,
a ROS blocker, rescued the cell growth inhibition, JNK activation, and PARP cleavage induced by the auranoﬁn and MK2206
combination. Our results indicate that interruption of the
cellular redox balance plays an important role in the synthetic
lethality induced by simultaneous inhibition of TXNRD1 and
AKT. We found that MK2206 inhibited the NRF2 activity and
reduced the GSH level through downregulating GCLC expression, which is consistent with a recent study that inhibition of
mTOR reduced GSH level and induced ROS in KRAS-mutant
lung cancer (50). Because mTOR pathway is regulated by AKT,
it is also possible that MK2206-induced ROS production may
be mediated by both NRF2 and mTOR inhibition. Nevertheless,
our results indicate that targeting the interactions between the
PI3K/AKT oncogenic pathway and cellular antioxidant system,
TXNRD1 and KEAP1/NRF2, will disrupt cancer redox homeostasis and might be a promising cancer therapeutic approach.
Loss-of-function mutations of KEAP1 occur in many cancer
types and KEAP1 mutations cause constitutive activation of
NRF2 (18–20). Because the combination of auranoﬁn and
MK2206 induced synthetic lethality by simultaneous inhibition
of the TXNRD1 and NRF2 pathways, we hypothesized that
KEAP1 mutations might render cancer cells resistant to the
combination of MK2006 and auranoﬁn. Our results showed

that lung cancer cells with wild-type KEAP1 were particularly
sensitive to MK2206 and auranoﬁn, whereas cells with mutant
KEAP1 were not as sensitive. This ﬁnding was further supported by evidence that MK2206 induced NRF2 nuclear exclusion and transcriptional activity in KEAP1 wild-type cells but
not in KEAP1-mutant cells. In addition, KEAP1 knockdown
in KEAP1 wild-type cells or reexpression of functional KEAP1
in KEAP1-mutant cells reversed the sensitivity to auranoﬁn
and MK2206 treatment. These ﬁndings indicate that the
synthetically lethal activity induced by MK2206 and auranoﬁn
depends on a functional KEAP1 gene. Further study of the
genetic mutations in this pathway and their association with
drug sensitivity may be useful for the identiﬁcation of predictive biomarkers.
In summary, we identiﬁed a set of synthetic loci that
could be targeted to improve the antitumor activity of AKT
inhibitor MK2206. We discovered that the synthetic lethal
interaction between the AKT pathway and TXNRD1 occurs
through the KEAP1/NRF2 antioxidant system, and targeting
such interaction with a combination of AKT inhibitor and
auranoﬁn is a promising approach for lung cancer therapy,
with KEAP1 mutation status as a genetic biomarker of drug
sensitivity.
