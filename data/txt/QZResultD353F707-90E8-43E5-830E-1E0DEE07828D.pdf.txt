Abstract
S phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2) has been shown to be required for
spontaneous tumor development that occurs in the retinoblastoma protein (pRb)
deficient mice. Here we have demonstrated that flavokawain A (FKA), a novel chalcone
from the kava plant, selectively inhibited the growth of pRb deficient cell lines and
resulted in a proteasome-dependent and ubiquitination-mediated Skp2 degradation.
Degradation of Skp2 by FKA was found to be involved in a functional Cullin1, but
independent of Cdh1 expression. Further studies have demonstrated that FKA
docked into the ATP binding pocket of the precursor cell-expressed developmentally
down-regulated 8 (NEDD8)-activating enzyme (NAE) complex, inhibited NEDD8
conjugations to both Cullin1 and Ubc12 in PC3 cells and Ubc12 NEDDylation in an in
vitro assay. Finally, dietary feeding of the autochthonous transgenic adenocarcinoma
of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice with FKA inhibited the formation of high-grade
prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia lesions (HG-PIN) and prostate adenocarcinomas,
reduced the tumor burden and completely abolished distant organ metastasis.
Immunohistochemistry studies revealed that dietary FKA feeding resulted in marked
anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects via down-regulation of Skp2 and NEDD8 and
up-regulation of p27/Kip1 in the prostate of TRAMP mice. Our findings therefore
provide evidence that FKA is a promising NEDDylation inhibitor for targeting Skp2
degradation in prostate cancer prevention and treatment.

Introduction

complex [2]. Skp2 plays a central role in cell cycle
regulation, cellular senescence, apoptosis, metabolism,
metastasis, and cancer stem cells by ubiquitinating a
wide range of substrates, including p27, ORC1, Cdt1,
KMT2A/MLL1 and others, for targeted degradation by the
proteasome [2, 3]. Skp2 has been considered as a protooncogene and its overexpression is frequently observed

Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of death
in man in the United States and represents a major public
health burden [1]. S phase kinase-associated protein 2
(Skp2) is a substrate recognition component of a SKP1CUL1-F-box protein (SCF) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase

in many cancers including prostate cancer [4]. Skp2
overexpression in prostate cancer is positively associated
with Gleason score, tumor grade, and biochemical failure
in men treated by prostatectomy [5-7]. Overexpression
of Skp2 alone in mouse prostate epithelial cells induces
adenocarcinomas in the mouse prostate [8]. In metastatic
and castration-resistant prostate cancer, Skp2 is a key
amplified gene [9]. Importantly, multiple studies using
Skp2 knockout mice have demonstrated that Skp2 is
required for spontaneous tumor development that occurs
in the pRb, Pten and p19Arf deficient mouse models [1013]. Since either mutated or silenced Pten and Rb are
common in prostate cancer [14, 15], Skp2 represents an
appealing drug target for prostate cancer prevention and
therapy.
Kava (Piper methysticum Forst) is an ancient
drink in the South Pacific Islands [16]. An observational
study has linked Kava consumption to lower cancer
incidences in the South Pacific Island nations despite
a high portion of smokers in these populations [17].
FKA is a predominant chalcone in the kava plant,
which constitutes up to 0.46% of the kava extract [18].
Recently, we and others have demonstrated that FKA
exerted potent anti-cancer and anti-carcinogenic activity
in a variety of cell culture systems and animal models
by induction of the mitochondria mediated apoptosis in
cancer cells via up-regulation of pro-apoptotic proteins
Bax and death receptor-5 (DR5) and down-regulation of
anti-apoptotic proteins (i.e. survivin and XIAP) [19-22].
In addition, FKA was shown to preferentially inhibit the
growth of p53 mutant bladder cancer cell lines [22]. FKA
selectively induces G1 arrest in p53 wild-type bladder
cancer RT4 cells via increasing p21/Waf1 and p27/Kip1
expression and G2M arrest in p53 mutant bladder cancer
cell lines (i.e. T24, UMUC3, TCCSUP, 5637, HT1376,
and HT1197) through down-regulation of Myt1 and Wee1
and activation of CDK1 [22]. However, the anti-cancer
mechanisms and key molecular targets of FKA’s action
remain largely unknown.
In this study, we have shown that FKA selectively
inhibits the growth of pRb deficient cell lines via inducing
a proteasome-dependent and ubiquitination-mediated
Skp2 degradation. In addition, FKA functions as a potent
cell active NEDDylation inhibitor to induce Cullin1 and
Ubc12 deNEDDylation and Skp2 degradation in all tested
cancer cell lines that were derived from prostate, breast,
renal, liver, lung, colon and cervical cancers, melanoma
and osteosarcoma regardless of their genetic background.
Finally, we found that FKA significantly reduced the
formation of HG-PIN and prostate adenocarcinomas
and blocked tumor metastasis in the TRAMP transgenic
mice. The in vivo mechanisms of the action of FKA
are associated with antiproliferation and induction of
apoptosis via down-regulation of Skp2 and NEDD8 and
up-regulation of p27/Kip1.

FKA selectively inhibits the growth of Rb deficient
cells and prostate cancer cells with overexpression
of Skp2
We have demonstrated that FKA, a kava chalcone
(Supplementary Fig. 1A), is a potent apoptosis inducer
against the growth of bladder cancer cells [19], but its
effect on the growth of prostate cancer cells has not been
reported before. Fig. 1A shows that FKA at concentrations
of up to 80 µM has no inhibitory effect on the growth
of normal prostate epithelial cells (PrECs) and prostate
stromal cells (PrSCs), while it inhibits the growth of
prostate cancer cell lines DU145, PC3 and 22Rv1 by
about 93%, 78% and 60%, respectively. DU145 cells, the
only cell line among the tested cells with the Rb loss, is
the most sensitive to the growth inhibitory effect of FKA.
To reach the experimental rigor, we further used the Rb
knockout and wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblast
(MEF) pairs. At a concentration of about 64 µM, FKA
treatment of Rb deficient MEFs causes about 92% growth
inhibition whereas it only inhibits the growth of Rb wildtype MEFs by about 38% (Fig. 1B) (P<0.01). To confirm
this phenomenon, we also treated Rb knockout mouse
prostate epithelial cell line with FKA. The IC50 of FKA
was estimated to be 30 µM in mouse epithelial prostate
cells (MPEC) Rb-/- cells, compared with approximately
74 µM in MPEC wild type cells (Supplementary Fig.
1B). Furthermore, Rb knock-down by siRNAs rendered
22Rv1 cells more sensitive to the growth inhibitory
effect of FKA, which also resulted in an increase in Skp2
expression and a decrease in p27 expression (Fig. 1C
and Supplementary Fig. 1C). These results consistently
indicate that FKA selectively inhibits the growth of Rb
deficient cells.
Multiple published papers have demonstrated
that Skp2 is critically required for the Rb loss induced
tumorigenesis in mice [10-13]. We therefore examined
whether Skp2 is a potential target responsible for FKA’s
growth inhibitory effect in prostate cancer cells. Fig.
1D shows that FKA is about 5 times more effective in
inhibiting the growth of PC3 cells with overexpression
of Skp2 (Supplementary Fig. 1D) compared to PC3
cells expressing pcDNA3.1 (IC50s of FKA for PC3/Skp2
and PC3/pcDNA are about 8 and 40 µM, respectively).
These data suggest that Skp2 is a potential target of FKA
for inhibiting the growth of pRb deficient prostate cancer
cells.

FKA accelerates Skp2 protein degradation via
a proteasome- and ubiquitination-mediated
mechanism

significantly accelerated in FKA-treated PC3 cells as
compared to the control treatment after new protein
synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide. The protein
expression levels of Skp2 at different time points after
cyloheximide and FKA treatments were measured by
densitometry measurement and adjusted for loading
control β-actin levels (Fig. 2B). To examine whether the
FKA mediated down-regulation of Skp2 protein expression
is due to active proteasome–dependent degradation (a
transcriptionally-independent mechanism), we have
stably expressed Skp2-myc fusion protein in PC3 cells,
which is driven by an exogenous CMV promoter. The
PC3/Skp2 cells were then treated with 40 µM FKA for 16
hours followed by 0.1%DMSO or a proteasome inhibitor
MG132. Fig.2C shows that MG132 can rescue the effect

We next examined the effect of FKA on Skp2
expression in prostate cancer cell lines. FKA treatments
do not affect Skp2 expression at the transcriptional
levels (data not shown), but down-regulates the protein
expression of Skp2 and induces the accumulation of p27
protein, a Skp2 substrate, in prostate cancer cell lines in a
dose and time manner (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig.
2). Two Skp2 splicing variants were detected at 46 and 48
kDa and both decreased by FKA treatment (Fig. 2A and
Supplementary Fig. 2).
Fig. 2B demonstrates that Skp2 degradation is

of the FKA induced down-regulation of Skp2-myc fusion
protein, suggesting a mechanism of proteasome-dependent
degradation.
We also examined whether Skp2 degradation by
FKA is associated with ubiquitination. Extensive Skp2
ubiquitin conjugates, as defined by the appearance of
more slowly migrating forms of Skp2, were observed
after FKA or a proteasome inhibitor MG132 (a positive
control) treatment (Fig. 2D). Together, these results clearly
indicate that FKA induces a proteasome dependent and
ubiqutination mediated Skp2 degradation in PC3 cells.

mediated Skp2 degradation.
The autocatalytic ubiquintination and degradation
of Skp2 requires both the binding of Skp2 to Cullin1 and
the ability of the Cullin1 to recruit Cdc34 and Roc1/Rbx
through its B-box motifs [24]. We therefore expressed
an F-box deleted Skp2 and a B-box deleted Cullin1,
respectively, in PC3 cells, and then examined the effect
of FKA on Skp2 or ΔFbox/Skp2 protein expression. Fig.
3C shows that FKA treatment does not stimulate the
degradation of ΔFbox/Skp2 protein that cannot bind to
Cullin1. In addition, the B-box deleted Cullin1 reverses
the effect of FKA on Skp2 degradation (Fig. 3D). These
results clearly indicate that Cullin1 is involved in FKAmediated Skp2 degradation.

FKA induced Skp2 degradation is independent
of Cdh1 expression, but associated with the
functional Skp2/Cullin1 complex

FKA inhibits Cullin1 and Ubc12 NEDDylation in
prostate cancer cells

Skp2 ubiquitination and degradation can be
mediated by either (1) the Cdh1/APC E3 complex [23] or
(2) through an autocatalytic mechanism involving a Skp2bound Cullin1-based core ubiquitin ligase [24]. As a first
step towards defining the mechanism of FKA mediated
Skp2 degradation, we examined whether Cdh1 expression
is required. FKA results in a decrease in Cdh1 expression
(Fig. 3A). However, suppression of Cdh1 by siRNAs
increases Skp2 protein levels, and does not reverse the
FKA mediated Skp2 degradation (Fig. 3B). These results
suggest that Cdh1 expression is not required for FKA

Cullin1 NEDDylation is processed by the NAE
transfer of NEDD8 to E2 Ubc12 and then from Ubc12
to Cullin1 [25]. Fig. 4A shows that FKA treatment of
LNCaP and PC3 cells for 24 hours significantly decreased
the endogenously NEDDylation of Cullin1 and Ubc12.
Further experiment also showed that FKA and a known
NAE inhibitor, MLN4924, treatments markedly inhibits
the induced NEDDylation of both Cullin1 and Ubc12 by
transfection of NEDD8 into PC3 cells, as evident by the

and 2) an intervention protocol in which mice were fed
with food that was supplemented with vehicle control or
0.6% FKA starting from 12 weeks of age (when overt
cancers are established) and ending at 24 weeks of age
(Fig. 5A). Fig. 5B shows that dietary feeding of 0.3% FKA
inhibited high-grade prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia
lesions (HG-PIN) by 69% and prostate adenocarcinomas
by 43% (Ps<0.05, Fisher exact test). Fig. 5C panel a
demonstrates that 12-week FKA feeding of TRAMP mice
from age of 12 weeks significantly decreased the tumor
burden (control: 2.22±0.77g versus FKA: 1.45±0.88g, P
< 0.05, Mann-Whitney U and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).
Three mice in control group exhibited neuroendocrine
carcinoma, whereas one mouse in 0.6% FKA fed mice
has neuroendocrine carcinoma. After excluding the mice
with poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas
from the analysis [27], the mean prostate weight for
TRAMP mice in the control group is 0.80±0.16 gram
versus 0.56±0.10 gram in 0.6% FKA treatment group (p
< 0.01, Fig. 5C panel b). The number of palpable tumors
was also decreased by about 73% in TRAMP mice fed
with 0.6% FKA food compared to those fed with vehicle
control (Fig. 5C, panel c). Approximately 10.5 % (2 out of
19) mice in control group have visible metastases, whereas
no metastasis was seen in 0.6% FKA fed mice (p < 0.01,
fisher exact test). (Fig.5C). FKA feeding did not result in a
decrease in body weight or the weight of major organs. No
other signs of toxicity were identified with FKA treatments
(Data not shown).

FKA docks into the ATP binding site of the
APPBP – UBA3–NEDD8 protein complex and
inhibits Ubc12 NEDDylation in vitro
The X-ray crystal structure of the quaternary
APPBP1–UBA3–NEDD8–ATP complex (PDB ID: 1R4N)
[26] was used as the initial structure for the computational
study. The flexible ligand was docked to a rigid receptor
and assigned a score reflecting the quality of the complex
according to Surflex-dock method (Sybyl-x2.0 program).
Currently, the favorable binding pose according to the
highest-scoring of FKA in the APPBP1–UBA3–NEDD8
complex is shown in Fig. 4C.
In the current docking simulation, the result shows
that there are four groups of FKA that can form H-bonds
with the surrounding residues of amino acids. In the upper
ring of FKA, the 4´-OCH3 group forms a H-bond with H-N
(Met80) (2.307 Å) while 6´-OH group forms a H-bond
with Asp81 (1.881 Å) and Lys103 (2.011 Å), respectively.
The carbonyl group of FKA forms two H-bonds (2.624 Å
and 1.968 Å) with the NH3 group of Lys103, respectively.
In addition, the 4-OCH3 group in the bottom ring of FKA
forms a H-bond (2.115 Å) with NH group of Ile289.
In an in vitro NEDD8 conjugation assay, FKA
inhibits the formation of NEDD8-Ubc12 conjugates
in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4D) with an IC50 of
approximately 5 µM.

FKA feeding decreases proliferation, increases
apoptosis and affects the expression of Skp2, p27
and NEDD8 in prostate tissues

FKA inhibits Cullin1 NEDDylation and induces
Skp2 degradation in a wide variety of cell lines
regardless of their genetic backgrounds

Microscopic examination of immunohistochemistrystained prostate tissue sections revealed that the number
of apoptotic cells in FKA fed TRAMP mice was 7 folds
higher than it is in the control food fed mice (the number of
apoptotic cells/field in control versus 0.3% FKA group is
26.9 ± 19.2 versus 3.4 ± 2.5; P < 0.01) (Fig. 6A, panel a).
The number of Ki67-positive cells in the prostate tissues
of FKA-fed TRAMP mice was 60.3% ± 12.7% compared
with 13.5% ± 5.8% in those of vehicle control–fed mice
(P < 0.01; Fig. 6A, panel 6b). This finding suggests both
in vivo anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of FKA on
prostate tumor tissues, thus slowing the progression of
prostate cancer in the TRAMP model.
Consistent with the in vitro results described above
and the in vivo anti-proliferative and apoptotic effect of
FKA, immunohistochemistry-stained prostate tissue
sections from FKA-fed TRAMP mice also exhibits a
significant decrease in both the intensity and the number of
Skp2- and NEDD8-positive cells and an increase in p27positive cells compared with those of vehicle control–fed
mice (Fig. 6A, panel c–e).

We also have examined the effect of FKA on Skp2
expression and Cullin1 NEDDylation in different cancer
cell lines, including prostate, breast, renal, liver, lung,
colon and cervical cancers, melanoma and osteosarcoma.
Regardless of their genetic background, FKA treatment
decreased the protein levels of Skp2 and Cullin1
NEDDylation in all tested cell lines (Supplementary Fig.
4). These results indicated that FKA is a potent cell active
NEDDylation inhibitor leading to Skp2 degradation.

Dietary feeding of FKA inhibits prostate
tumorigenesis in the TRAMP model
To examine whether FKA inhibits different stages
of prostate cancer development, a cohort of mice were
treated under two different protocols: 1) a prevention
protocol in which mice were fed with food supplemented
with vehicle control or 0.3% FKA (3g/kg food) starting
from 6 weeks old of age and ending at 12 weeks of age;

p27/Kip1 in all tested cancer cell lines regardless their
genetic background (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig.
2) and in vivo in the prostate of the TRAMP mice (Fig.
5). This result suggests that Skp2 is a main target for the
anti-cancer mechanisms of FKA. FKA deserves further
investigations for targeting prevention or intervention
in subgroups of prostate cancer high-risk populations or
patients with pRb or Pten deficiency.
The down-regulation of Skp2 by FKA is not
through transcriptional regulation, but by accelerating
its degradation. Since proteasome inhibitor MG132 was
reported to regulate Skp2 expression at the transcription
level [36], we transfected PC3 cells with Myc-tagged
Skp2, which is driven by an exogenous CMV promoter.
Therefore, the protein level of Myc-Skp2 was not affected
by MG132 treatment alone, but MG132 completely
reversed the FKA-induced inhibition of Myc-Skp2
expression (Fig. 2B). This result suggests that FKA
induced Skp2 degradation is dependent on proteasome
function. We have also shown that FKA induces Skp2
ubiquitination. It is likely that FKA degrades Skp2 through
a proteasome-dependent and ubiquitin-mediated pathway.
Skp2 ubiquitination and degradation has been
reported either through a Cullin1-dependent autocatalytic
mechanism or by the Cdh1/APC/C complex [23, 24]. Our
results did not support the involvement of the Cdh1/APC/C
complex in the FKA mediated Skp2 degradation, as FKA
itself decreased the expression of Cdh1 and knockdown
of Cdh1 expression by siRNA did not prevent the FKA
mediated down-regulation of Skp2 expression (Fig. 3A
and 3B). In addition, pRb has recently been shown to be
required for the Cdh1/APC/C complex mediated Skp2
degradation [37]. However, FKA down-regulates the
expression of Skp2 regardless the genetic background of
tested cell lines in PC3 and 22Rv1 cells expressing wildtype Rb and DU145 cells harboring Rb deletion (Fig. 2A
and supplementary Figure 2). This further supports that
other Rb and Cdh1 independent mechanisms are involved
in FKA-mediated Skp2 degradation.
The F-box domain of Skp2 is required for the
auto-ubiquitination of Skp2 by the Skp1- Cullin1-Roc1
complex [24]. When the F-box domain was deleted or
Cullin1 was knocked out, Skp2 expression remained
higher under serum starvation condition and could not
be ubiquitinated in vitro [24]. We have shown that FKA
was not able to down-regulate the expression of F-box
deleted Skp2 and that ectopic expression of B-box deleted
Cullin-1 restored the FKA-mediated down-regulation
of Skp2 expression (Fig. 3C and 3D). The autocatalytic
ubiquintination and degradation of Skp2 also requires
the ability of the Cullin1 to recruit Cdc34 and Roc1/Rbx
through its B-box motifs [24]. These results support that
functional Cullin1 is required for the FKA mediated Skp2
degradation.
The activity of the Cullin1-containing ubiquitin
protein ligase complex SCFSkp2 for p27Kip1

Western blotting further confirms that that FKA
feeding decreases the protein levels of NEDDylated
Cullin1, Cullin1 and Skp2 and increases the protein
expression of the levels of p27 in prostate tissues of the
TRAMP mice (Fig. 6B, upper panels). FKA feeding did
not affect the expression of the transgenes SV40T protein
and the loading control tubulin (Fig.6B, lower panels).

Discussion
Asian/Pacific men who consume a low fat and
plant-based diet have the lowest rates of clinical prostate
cancer in the world [28, 29]. However, when Asian men
migrate to the US, rates of clinical prostate cancer increase
[28, 29]. These observations implicate an important role
of both environmental factors and dietary habits (such
as consumption of low-fat and plant-based diet) in
the incidence of prostate cancer. Therefore, one of the
strategies for prevention and treatment of prostate cancer
has focused on the use of natural and synthetic bioactive
food components. Chalcones belong to a specific class of
flavonoids, many of which occur in fruits, vegetables and
beverages (tea, coffee, beer, wine and fruit drinks) [30]. In
this study we have demonstrated that FKA, a predominant
chalcone in kava drink, selectively inhibits the growth
of pRb deficient cell lines through targeting oncogenic
protein Skp2 degradation. In addition, dietary feeding of
FKA effectively reduced the occurrence of HG-PIN and
prostate adenocarcinomas and blocked tumor metastasis
in the TRAMP model.
Skp2 is overexpressed in 86.4 % (64 of 74 samples)
of pre-malignant HG-PIN and in 557 of 622 (89.2%) of
primary prostate cancer specimens [7]. Skp2 interacts
with pRb, Pten, androgen receptor (AR), and H-Ras
in prostate cancer [4, 10-12, 31-34], and serves as a
critical converging point for these genes in regulation of
senescence [10-13]. Skp2 is a pRb target gene and pRb
represses Skp2 mRNA expression [33]. Rb also directly
binds to the N terminus of Skp2 to interfere with its
function [33]. Nuclear Pten enhances APC/Cdh1 activity
that degrades Skp2 [32]. Therefore, the elevated Skp2
levels duo to the pRb or Pten loss were suggested to be a
main contributor to tumorigenesis and cancer progression.
Indeed, genetic inactivation of Skp2 triggered a potent
senescence response to a restriction of tumorigenesis to
the prostate in the Pten deficient mice [13], and abolished
spontaneous tumorigenesis in Rb1 (+/-) mice [10-12].
Since allelic loss or reduced expression of Rb in 25% to
50% of human prostate cancer [14, 35], and Pten deletion
and/or mutations in 30% of primary prostate cancer and
63% of metastatic prostate cancer [15] were associated
with more frequent clinical recurrence, Skp2 may serve an
“Achilles’ heel” type of drug target to effectively prevent
or treat pRb and/or Pten deficient prostate cancer. Here,
we have shown that FKA effectively down-regulated
Skp2 protein levels with corresponding accumulation of

to mention: The results from analysis of Uba3−/− or
Skp2-/- embryos revealed that both the NEDD8 system
and Skp2 are critical for the control of the mitotic and
endoreduplicative cell cycle progression [39]. These
results suggested the NEDD8 system and Skp2 may
form a yet to be defined signaling axis in regulation of
the control of the mitotic and endoreduplicative cell cycle
progression. Therefore, further studies are in progress to
determine whether there is a potential direct interaction
between the NEDDylation pathway and Skp2 degradation.
Since Skp2 overexpression is frequently observed in
many cancers and associated with poor prognosis [2, 4],
as well as play a critical role in tumorigenesis, cell cycle
regulation, metastasis and metabolism [10-15], further
elucidation in the novel mechanism of Skp2 degradation
that are independent of the Cdh1/APC/C complex
may open a new avenue for designing cancer-specific
prevention and therapy.
The transgene SV40T in the TRAMP model can
bind to and inactivate pRb and p53 tumor suppressor

ubiquitylation is stimulated by linking the ubiquitin-like
protein NEDD8 to Cullin1. Similar to ubiquitination,
NEDDylation of Cullin1 is involved in sequential
attachment of NEDD8 to a thiolester within a specific
cysteine site of NEDD8-E1 (NEDD8-activating enzyme,
NAE, APP-BP1/Uba3) and NEDD8-E2 (Ubc12) [25].
Recently, the NEDD8 pathway has become an important
target for cancer therapy. MLN4924 is a first-in-class
inhibitor of the NEDD8 pathway by binding to and
inhibiting NAE [25]. Based on its promising preclinical
efficacy, MLN4924 has been advanced to Phase I clinical
trials for treatment of multiple human malignancies [38].
We have demonstrated that FKA docks into the ATP
binding pocket of the APPBP1–Uba3–NEDD8 complex
and inhibits Ubc12 NEDDylation in in vitro system and
NEDDylation of Cullin1and Ubc12 in all tested cell lines,
as well as in the prostate tissues of the TRAMP mice.
Further studies are in progress to determine whether
FKA directly bind to Uba3 or Ubc12 and interferes with
the process of NEDDylation. In addition, it is worth

NAE to Ubc12 and Cullin1. The deNEDDylation of Cullin1by FKA then results in Skp2 auto-ubiquitination and degradation.

may present new opportunity for targeting Skp2 in
prevention and treatment of cancer. The observed
inhibition of prostate tumorigenesis and subsequent
metastasis by dietary FKA is caused by selective apoptotic
death and anti-proliferative effects. The potential use of
FKA with an excellent safety profile is a major plus in
the planning of translational development of FKA-based
prevention and therapy.

proteins leading to cell transformation [40]. Skp2 is
strongly expressed in the hyperplastic/dysplastic and
prostate carcinoma regions in the TRAMP model in our
study. This model is therefore suitable for studying agents
that inhibit pRb deficient prostate cancer through targeting
Skp2. We have shown that dietary FKA effectively inhibits
all stages of prostate cancer development, which reduce
the incidences of both HG-PIN and prostate carcinoma.
Importantly, the mechanism of prostate cancer inhibition
by dietary FKA is not through down-regulation of the
transgene as the protein levels of SV40T are equal
between vehicle control and FKA fed mice. In addition,
dietary FKA completely blocked distant organ metastasis.
However, the incidence of visible distant organ metastasis
is relatively low (about 10.5%) in the TRAMP mice
generated in our study. Our study of dietary FKA on tumor
metastasis in the TRMAP model may be limited by not
enough sample size for studying metastasis. Therefore, this
result requires further validation with a primary endpoint
of metastasis using a larger sample size. In our recent
studies, we have also demonstrated that dietary FKA
increased the survival of bladder tumor bearing mice and
reduced tumor growth in the UPII-SV40 bladder specific
transgenic model. In all of our studies, dietary FAK did
not cause any body weight loss or changes in food and
water consumption and normal organ functions [20, 41].
Further pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution studies
found that FKA is concentrated in urine and accumulates
at higher concentrations in liver, kidney and prostate than
in lung via dietary supplementation [20, 42]. Therefore,
compared to other methods (i.e. intraperitoneal injection
and gavage) of FKA delivery, dietary FKA is effective
in inhibiting tumorigenesis in both bladder and prostate
cancer transgenic carcinogenesis model with satisfactory
safety profile.
In the present study, dietary FKA was found to
be effective in inhibition of proliferation and in marked
induction of apoptosis in pre-cancerous and cancerous
cells in the TRAMP model. This result is similar with our
recent observations in the FKA fed bladder cancer model
[20]. Also in consistency with the in vitro mechanisms of
FKA’s action, dietary FKA results in down-regulation of
Skp2 and NEEDylation of Cullin1 and up-regulation of
p27/Kip1 in the prostate tissues of the TRAMP model.
In summary, FKA selectively inhibits the growth of
pRb deficient cells through inducing deNEDDylation and
Skp2 degradation. The FKA induced Skp2 degradation or
down-regulation is independent of Cdh1 and the genetic
backgrounds of tested cells lines, such as pRb deletion
or p53 mutations, but requires a functional cullin1.Our
data are consistent with the model shown in Figure 7.
FKA docks into the active site of the NAE complex and
inhibits the transfer of NEDD8 to Ubc12 and Cullin1.
Then, Cullin1 deNEDDylation results in Skp2 autoubiquitination and degradation. Further investigation of
this novel Cullin1-mediated Skp2 degradation pathway

TRAMP mice study

The X-ray crystal structure of the quaternary
amyloid precursor protein-binding protein (APPBP1) –
Ubiquitin-Like Modifier Activating Enzyme 3 (UBA3)–
NEDD8–ATP complex was retrieved from the Protein
Data Bank (PDB code: 1R4N) [26] and processed in
order to remove the ligands/water molecules with the
module of Biopolymer (Sybyl-x2.0 program) [50].
Hydrogen atoms were added to the protein structure using
standard geometries with Biopolymer module. Pre-Dock
