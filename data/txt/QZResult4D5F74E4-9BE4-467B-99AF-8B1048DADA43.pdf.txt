ABSTRACT
Loss of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra (SN) is a pathological
hallmark of Parkinson’s disease (PD), which leads to the onset of motor symptoms.
Previously, our in vitro studies revealed that Angiotensin II (Ang II) induced apoptosis
of dopaminergic neurons through its type 1 receptor (AT1R), but these findings
needed to be confirmed via animal experiments. Here, using a rotenone-induced rat
model of PD, we observed an overactivation of Ang II/AT1R axis in the SN, since Ang
II level and AT1R expression were markedly increased. Furthermore, we provided
in vivo evidence that Ang II directly elicited apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons via
activation of AT1R in the SN of rats. More importantly, we showed for the first time
that oral administration of azilsartan, a newly developed AT1R blocker approved by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration for hypertension treatment, rescued the apoptosis
of dopaminergic neurons and relieved the characteristic parkinsonian symptoms in
PD rats. These results support the application of AT1R blockers in PD therapy, and
strengthen the notion that many therapeutic agents may possess pleiotropic action
in addition to their main applications.

INTRODUCTION

of rigidity, bradykinesia, resting tremor and postural
instability [8]. A number of studies have suggested a
potential relationship between hyperactivated RAS within
the basal ganglia and PD progression, since the level of
Ang II was significantly increased in the SN and striatum
of PD patients. This finding was also supported by a
series of in vitro experiments showing that Ang II, via
AT1R, induced loss of dopaminergic neurons and thus
contributed to the pathogenesis of PD [6]. Furthermore,
our previous studies using CATH.a cell revealed that Ang
II-triggered loss of dopaminergic neurons was attributed to
cell apoptosis [9, 10]. However, all these in vitro findings
need to be further confirmed via animal experiments.
In this study, we confirm that Ang II elicits apoptosis
of dopaminergic neurons through an AT1R-dependent
manner in the SN of normal rats. More importantly, we
provide the first evidence that oral administration of
azilsartan, a newly developed AT1R blocker approved
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
hypertension treatment [11], rescues the apoptosis of

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is widely
accepted as an important modulator within circulation
system, regulating the blood pressure and maintaining the
sodium and water homeostasis [1]. Angiotensin II (Ang
II) is the major effector of RAS, and most of its classical
peripheral functions were medicated by Ang II type 1
receptor (AT1R) [2]. Recently, numerous studies have
demonstrated that independent RAS existed in many other
tissues and organs including the brain [3-5]. The locally
formed Ang II plays an important functional role in the
central nervous system [6] and has also been linked to
several neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease
(PD) [7].
PD is well recognized as the second most common
neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer’s disease, and
is mainly attributed to a progressive loss of dopaminergic
neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) [8]. Decreased
viability of dopaminergic neurons leads to the onset

approximately increased by 80% when compared with
that of control rats (P < 0.05). Afterwards, we employed
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR) and western blotting to investigate whether the
expression of Ang II receptors was also changed in the
SN of this model. As indicated by Figure 3B-3F, AT1R
mRNA and protein levels in the SN of PD rat models were
respectively elevated by 84.4% and 76.9% in comparison
to control group (P < 0.05), whilst no obvious changes of
Ang II type 2 receptor (AT2R) level were observed (P >
0.05). These findings implied that Ang II/AT1R axis might
be involved in the pathogenesis of PD.

RESULTS
Ang II/AT1R axis is upregulated in the SN of a rat
model of PD

Exogenous Ang II triggers apoptosis of
dopaminergic neurons via an AT1R-dependent
manner in the right SN of rats

In this study, a rat model of PD was successfully
established using a four-week infusion of rotenone
(2.5 mg/kg/d) [12], since chronic rotenone treatment
significantly prolonged descent latency when compared
with that in the control group (Figure 1, P < 0.05).
Meanwhile, the systolic blood pressure (SBP) of rats was
not altered during this process (Figure 2, P > 0.05).
To determine whether Ang II and its receptors
were involved in the pathogenesis of PD, we first used a
commercial enzymatic immunoassay (EIA) kit to detect
the level of Ang II in the SN of PD rats. As revealed by
Figure 3A, the level of Ang II in the SN of PD rats was

To further determine the relationship between Ang
II/AT1R axis and PD pathogenesis, exogenous Ang II
was directly infused into the right SN of normal rats for
one week. During this process, the SBP of rats was not
significantly altered (Figure 4).
First, immunohistochemical staining was used to
examine the effect of exogenous Ang II on dopaminergic
neurons in the right SN of rats. As indicated in Figure 5A

azilsartan ameliorates the apoptosis of
dopaminergic neurons and rescues characteristic
parkinsonian behaviors in a rat model of PD

and 5B, exogenous Ang II triggered neuronal losses in the
right SN of rats, as Ang II (60 ng/h) significantly decreased
the number of TH-positive neurons by approximately 70%
(P < 0.05). As seen in Figure 5A and 5B, co-treatment
with losartan (200 ng/h) significantly rescued the decrease
of TH-positive neurons caused by Ang II (P < 0.05). It
should be noted that losartan (200 ng/h) alone did not
significantly influence the number of TH-positive neurons
in comparison to vehicle (P > 0.05). To further determine
whether the loss of dopaminergic neurons was attributed
to cell apoptosis, the activity of caspase-3, a key executor
of apoptosis, was determined using a colorimetric assay
kit. As shown by Figure 5C, Ang II (60 ng/h) increased
the caspase-3 activity nearly by 2.5-fold (P < 0.05) of
control, whereas co-infusion with losartan (200 ng/h)
notably abolished this increase caused by Ang II. Taken
together, these results demonstrated that exogenous Ang II
triggers apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons via an AT1Rdependent manner in the right SN of rats.

To translate the above findings into a clinically
relevant context, rats were orally administered with
vehicle or a novel AT1R blocker azilsartan (5 mg/kg/d)
during the four-week rotenone infusion (2.5 mg/kg/d).
During this process, the SBP of rats was not significantly
altered (Figure 2).
As shown in Figure 6A and 6B, the decreased
number of TH-positive neurons in the SN of PD rats
was dramatically rescued by azilsartan (5 mg/kg/d)
administration (P < 0.05). Of note, azilsartan (5 mg/kg/d)
alone did not obviously change the number of TH-positive
neurons in the SN of PD rats. The result indicated that
azilsartan rescued the loss of dopaminergic neurons. As
seen in Figure 6C, co-treatment with azilsartan (5 mg/

kg/d) also attenuated the activation of caspase-3 in the SN
of PD rats, since its activity was reduced by 1.6-fold (P
< 0.05) after azilsartan treatment. This further indicated
that azilsartan prevented neuronal losses via inhibiting
apoptotic signaling.
Afterwards, the catalepsy tests were employed to
investigate whether azilsartan can relieve the characteristic
symptoms of PD rats. As suggested in Figure 7A and 7B,
the prolonged descent latency of PD rats was significantly
shortened following azilsartan (5 mg/kg/d) treatment (P
< 0.05), indicating that azilsartan rescued characteristic
parkinsonian behaviors in PD rats. It was noteworthy that
azilsartan (5 mg/kg/d) had no obvious influence on the
descent latency when compared with the control group (P
> 0.05).

was increased in the SN of PD rats, and this was consistent
with previous observations in an animal model of PD
with dopamine depletion [15]. All these findings further
strengthened the association between overactivation of
Ang II/AT1R axis and development of PD.
Next, to further elucidate the role of brain Ang
II/AT1R axis in PD progression, we directly infused
exogenous Ang II into the SN of normal rats. We
observed that excessive Ang II triggered an obvious
loss of dopaminergic neurons in the SN of rats, since
the number of TH-positive neurons was dramatically
reduced. Meanwhile, we revealed the Ang II-induced loss
of dopaminergic neurons was at least partially attributed
to cell apoptosis, as the activity of caspase-3, a key
executioner of apoptosis, was notably enhanced following
Ang II infusion. Furthermore, the aforementioned
pathogenic effects of Ang II in the SN of rat could be
significantly reversed by co-infusion of losartan, an
AT1R blocker. These findings supported our previous
observations that Ang II triggered neuronal apoptosis via
an AT1R-dependent manner in dopaminergic neuronal
cell lines or mouse primary dopaminergic neurons [9, 16,
17]. Intriguingly, the underlying mechanisms by which
Ang II triggered apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons
seemed to be multifactorial. Previously, using CATH. a
cell, a dopaminergic neuronal cell line stably expressing

DISCUSSION
Several lines of evidence suggested a potential
association of Ang II/AT1R axis with the progression of
PD, since a significantly higher level of Ang II in the CSF
or brain tissues was observed in PD animal models as
well as patients with this disease [13, 14]. Here, in support
of these findings, we showed that the level of Ang II in
the SN was obviously elevated in a rotenone-induced rat
model of PD. Meanwhile, we also showed that AT1R level

AT1R, we demonstrated that Ang II triggered apoptosis
via enhancement of NADPH oxidase-mediated oxidative
stress [9]. Meanwhile, another in vitro study indicated
that Ang II induced apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons
by activation of autophagy through an AT1R-mediated
fashion [16]. In addition, emerging evidence suggested
that mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic signaling was
also involved in Ang II-induced apoptosis in dopaminergic
neurons [17]. Nevertheless, these potential mechanisms
needed to be further verified in vivo using PD animal
models.
It is worthy to note that our findings also implied a
therapeutic potential of AT1R blocker for PD treatment. As
a newly developed AT1R blocker, azilsartan was approved
by FDA for the treatment of essential hypertension in 2011
[18]. According to a receptor binding and function study,
azilsartan bound tightly to and dissociated slowly from
AT1R when compared with other antagonists, and thus
elicits more potent and long-lasting bioeffects in vivo [19].
Apart from its main applications, azilsartan was revealed
to exert beneficial effects in animal models of myocardial
infarction [20]. Meanwhile, azilsartan was able to
ameliorate metabolic syndrome and kidney damage in rats
with type 2 diabetes [21]. In addition, anti-inflammatory

actions of oral azilsartan treatment was also observed in an
experimental model of oral mucositis [22]. Interestingly,
in this study, we extended its application by showing that
oral administration of azilsartan for 4 weeks not only
rescued the apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons but also
relieved the characteristic parkinsonian symptoms in a PD
rat model induced by rotenone. Of note, these effects are
independent of its BP-lowering effects, since azilsartan
at the current dose (5mg/kg/d) and treatment duration
(4 weeks) did not significantly alter the SBP of PD rats.
To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating a
protective effect of chronic azilsartan administration in a
rat model of PD.
Summarily, in the current study, we provide in vivo
evidence that overactivation of brain Ang II/AT1R axis
contributes to the progression of PD. More importantly, we
reveal a protective effect of azilsartan, a newly developed
AT1R blocker, in a rat model of PD induced by rotenone.
These results further support the application of AT1R
blockers in the therapy of PD, and strengthen the notion
that many therapeutic agents may possess pleiotropic
action in addition to their main applications [23, 24].

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Ang II, losartan (an AT1R antagonist), and rotenone
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Inc. Azilsartan (a
novel AT1R antagonist) was purchased from MedChem
Express Inc.

[27]. Before implanted into animals, the pumps were
incubated in sterile saline for at least 40 h at 37oC. Rats
were fixed to a stereotactic frame (David Kopf Inc.)
after being anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (0.35
ml/100 g). Stainless infusion cannula was implanted
in predetermined coordinates for the right supranigral
placement (anteroposterior: 5.5 mm; mediolateral: 2.5
mm; dorsoventral: 7.0 mm, from bregma as a reference).
The pumps were embedded subcutaneously on the backs
of the rats.

Animals and experimental groups

Blood pressure measurements

Male Lewis rats (280-300 g) were obtained from
the Shanghai branch of the National Rodent Laboratory
Animal Resources of China. Rats were housed in an airconditioned room under 12 h light and dark cycles. Water
and food were provided ad libitum. Animal care and
experimental protocols were carried out in accordance
with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals of Nanjing First Hospital and were approved
by the Biological Research Ethics Committee of Nanjing
First Hospital.
A rat model of PD was established as described [12].
Osmotic minipumps (model 2ML4, Alzet Inc.) were filled
with rotenone or vehicle alone. Pumps were incubated at
37oC overnight in sterile saline before implantation. Rats
were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (0.35 mL/100
g), and osmotic minipumps were embedded under the skin
of the back for 4 weeks. Control rats received vehicle, and
treated rats received rotenone (2.5 mg/kg/day).
To investigate the relationship between Ang II/
AT1R axis and PD pathogenesis, male Lewis rats were
randomly divided into 4 groups: control group, Ang II (60
ng/) group, Ang II (60 ng/h) + losartan (200 ng/h) group,
and losartan (200 ng/h) group. The doses of Ang II and
losartan were chosen according to our previous studies
[25, 26]. They were continuously infused into the right
SN, alone or in combination, for one week by a osmotic
pump with an indwelling cannula (model 2004, Alzet Inc.)
[25, 27]. The details regarding supranigral infusion were
described in section 4.3.
To determine whether oral administration of
azilsartan exerts neuroprotection in PD models, rats were
randomly divided into 4 groups: control group, PD group,
PD + azilsartan (5 mg/kg/d, i.g., for 4 weeks) group and
control + azilsartan (5 mg/kg/d, i.g., for 4 weeks) group.
The dose of azilsartan was selected based on a recent
study by Hye et al [28].

SBP was measured by the tail cuff method (Visitech
Systems Inc.) at the end of treatments as described [29].
Each measurement was carried out 3-5 times to acquire a
mean SBP.

Supranigral infusion

The activity of caspase-3 in the SN of rat was
measured by a colorimetric assay as described [17].
In brief, the SN of rats were lysed in extraction buffer
(Beyotime Inc.), and the activity of caspase-3 was
analyzed with a colorimetric assay kit (Abcam Inc.)
following the manufacturer’s instructions.

Reagents and preparation

Neurological behavioral measurements (catalepsy
tests)
The catalepsy tests contained a vertical grid test and
a horizontal bar test. They were performed at the end of
treatments as described [30].
For the vertical grid test, a specific gridiron (44
cm high and 25.5 cm wide with a space of 1 cm between
wires) was used. When the rat was hung by all four paws
on the vertical grid, the stopwatch was started. When a
paw dropped from the grid, the stopwatch was stopped.
The taken time was recorded as descent latency. Maximum
descent latency time was fixed at 120 s.
For the horizontal bar test, each rat was placed
with its forepaws on a metal rod suspended 9 cm above
the floor. The taken time (descent latency) was recorded
before it climbed down from the bar. Maximum descent
latency time was fixed at 120 s.

EIA for Ang II levels in the SN
The SN of rat was dissected and homogenized, then
centrifuged (3000 r/min for 15 min at 4°C) to remove
cellular debris. The level of Ang II in the SN was measured
using specific EIA kits (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals Inc.)
as described [29]. The absorbance of every well was
determined by the spectrophotometer at 450 nm.

Colorimetric assay for caspase-3 activity

Briefly, a 7-day unilateral right supranigral infusion
was performed with osmotic pumps (model 2004, Alzet
Inc.) connecting with an indwelling cannula placed
above the dorsal mid-portion of the right SN as described

H2O2 for 30 min to quench the endogenous peroxidases.
Then the slides were dealt with 0.5% Triton-X 100 for 30
min, blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min,
and incubated at 4oC overnight with primary antibodies:
monoclonal mouse anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (anti-TH;
1:2000; Sigma Inc.). After that the sections were incubated
for 1 h in the secondary antibody: peroxidase conjugated
goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1000; Sigma Inc.). After the
diaminobenzidine reaction, sections were counterstained
with Mayer’s hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted
on slides. Cells with positive tyrosine hydroxylase
immunoreactivity (brown granules) were counted as
TH-positive cells. Cell counting was performed with a
microscope equipped with a camera by three independent
observers who were blinded to the experimental groups.

Total RNA was extracted from the SN with Trizol
(Invitrogen, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines. Equal amounts of total RNA were reverse
transcribed with the PrimeScriptTM RT Master Mix
(Takara Bio Inc) under standard conditions as described
[31]. Subsequently, quantitative real-time PCR reactions
were performed with SYBR Green Premix Ex Taq (Takara
Bio Inc) and specific primers to detect AT1R and AT2R
expressions. Meanwhile, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was adopted as an internal
control, as its expression showed minimal variation in
different tissues. Primers sequences: for AT1R: forward

Statistical analysis
Data were presented as mean±SD. Comparisons
between groups were assessed by independent samples t
test or one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed
by Tukey’s post hoc test using SPSS software (version
17.0). Differences were considered significant at P < 0.05.

Western blotting analysis
Western blotting analysis was performed as
described [32]. The SN tissues were homogenized,
the total proteins were extracted in RIPA lysis buffer
(Beyotime Inc.) and the protein concentrations were
assayed by a BCA kit (Beyotime Inc.). Different
samples with an equal amount of protein were separated
on 10-15% SDS polyacrylamide gels, transferred to
nitrocellulose filter membranes, and blocked in 5% nonfat
milk at room temperature for 2 h. The membranes were
incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies
against AT1R (1:800; Abcam Inc.), AT2R (1:1000; Abcam
Inc.) and β-actin (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology
Inc.). Afterwards, the membranes were washed with
1×TBST for three times and incubated with horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-coupled secondary antibody for 2 h at
room temperature. Finally, after rinsing with 1×TBST,
protein bands were detected with the chemiluminescent
HRP substrate (Thermo Scientific Inc.) for 5min at room
temperature and exposed to X-ray film (Fujifilm Inc.).
The signal intensity was quantified using Quantity One
software 4.6.2 (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.) and normalized
to β-actin.
