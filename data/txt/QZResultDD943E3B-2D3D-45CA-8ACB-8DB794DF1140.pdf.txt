ABSTRACT
We established two patient derived tumor cells (PDCs) from right and left
pulmonary metastatic lesions respectively of a patient with giant cell tumor. At that
time, patient-derived tumor cells from right and left surgical specimens were collected
and cultured. High-throughput screening (HTS) for 24 drugs was conducted with
a micropillar/microwell chip platform using giant cell tumor PDCs. Using 6 doses
per drug in 6 replicates for giant cell tumor PDCs, the dose response curves and
corresponding IC50 values were calculated from the scanned images using the S+
Chip Analyzer. A sensitive response was more significantly achieved for AZD4547
(FGFR2 inhibitor) in giant cell tumor PDCs originated from the right pulmonary nodule
under the micropillar/microwell chip platform using 3D culture. This sensitivity was
consistent with the target expression patterns of giant cell tumor PDCs (FGFR2-IIIC
mRNA expression in giant cell tumor PDCs originated from the right pulmonary nodule
was increased significantly as compared to those originated from left). However, in
a conventional 2D cultured MTT assay, there was no difference for IC50 values of
AZD4547 between giant cell tumor PDCs originated from right and left pulmonary
nodules. An HTS platform based on 3D culture on micropillar/microwell chips and
PDC models could be applied as a useful preclinical tool to evaluate the intrapatient
tumor/response heterogeneity. This platform based on 3D culture might reflect far
better the relation between the tumor-biology and the matched targeted agent as
compared to a conventional 2D cultured MTT assay.

INTRODUCTION

reported in 1926. One of the most common organs for
distant metastasis from GCT is lung, ranging from 1 to
9% in incidence [6–9].
Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) is a
transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that mediates
angiogenesis, as well as proliferation and survival of
cancer cells [10, 11]. Dysregulation of the FGFR gene
expression, including gene amplification and mutation, is
known to be associated with cancer progression [10, 12].
The role of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor 2 IIIC
(FGFR2 IIIC) has been underscored in GCT, especially

Giant cell tumor of bone (GCT) is an aggressive
osteolytic and potentially metastatic bone tumor, which
has a predilection anatomic sites of long bones such as
distal femur, proximal tibia and distal radius [1]. High
recurrence rates of 18–60% following aggressive surgical
resection have been reported for GCT, which rarely
undergoes malignant transformation [2–5]. However,
distant metastasis of GCTs of the bone is extremely rare.
Lung metastasis of a benign GCT of the bone was first

in osteogenic differentiation of GCT cells [13]. In
GCT, FGF-2 stimulates FGFR2 expression, resulting in
increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteopontin
expression. Inhibition of FGFR2 through siRNA decreased
the expression of osteopontin in GCT stromal cells
resulting in FGF2 ligand induced downstream signaling
pathway, and possibly cell growth inhibition [13].
We previously demonstrated that patient derived
tumor cells (PDCs) are feasible preclinical model which
closely resemble the patient tumor genome and clinical
response [14]. The micropillar/microwell chip platform
has been developed to facilitate miniaturized 3D cell
cultures and perform high throughput, biochemical
and cell-based assays [15]. Owing to the importance of
microenvironment, especially in GCTs where both stromal
and tumor cells are important components of the tumor,
we utilized 3-D HTS to screen for potentially efficacious
anti-cancer drug in metastatic GCT PDC model.

also confirmed in monolayer culture using MTT assay
(Figure 2D).

Differential expression of FGFR2 IIIc between
right and lung metastatic nodules
In order to investigate the response heterogeneity
to AZD4547 (FGFR2 inhibitor) and BGJ-398 (pan-FGFR
inhibitor) in the HTS with a micropillar/microwell chip
platform using 3D culture between giant cell tumor PDCs
originated from right and left, we measured relative mRNA
expression of FGFR2 IIIC, as target of FGFR inhibitor, via
qRT-PCR. As shown in Figure 3A, FGFR2IIIC expression
was significantly increased in PDCs originated from right
pulmonary nodule as compared to PDCs originated from
left. Moreover, we evaluated the difference of osteogenic
differentiation between giant cell tumor PDCs originated
from right and left. Osteopontin (an osteoblastic marker)
protein level was increased in giant cell tumor PDCs
originated from left [13]. However, fibroblast growth
factor (FGF) treatment promoted the osteopontin protein
level in giant cell tumor PDCs established from right
which was sensitive to FGFR inhibitor but not in PDCs
generated from left nodule (Figure 3B).

DISCUSSION

A 30-year-old man with a recurrent giant cell
tumor received sacrectomy, coccygectomy and pelvic
mass removal followed by postoperative radiotherapy
4 years ago. During regular follow-up, a chest computed
tomography (CT) scan revealed two right and left
pulmonary nodules (Figure 1A). The patient underwent
metastasectomy for the right and left pulmonary nodules.
At that time, patient-derived tumor cells from right and
left surgical specimens were collected and cultured
(Figure 1B). Cells were grown in 3D culture condition
with alginate to be screened using micropillar/microwell
chip system. 24 drugs (AZD2281, AZD4547, AZD5363,
AZD6094, AZD6244, AZD1775, everolimus, crizotinib,
dasatinib, regorafenib, LJM-716, vemurafenib, cetuximab,
GDC0449, RXDX-106, PF-02299304, lapatinib, BEZ235,
AZD2014, LEE011, staurosporin, neratinib, BGJ-398
were tested (Figure 2A). Based on the image analysis of
the 3D cell culture HTS platform using PDCs, among 24
drugs tested AZD4547 and BGJ-398 demonstrated more
significant growth inhibition of PDCs from the right
pulmonary metastatic lesion as compared to left. Using 6
doses per drug in 6 replicates for right and left giant cell
tumor PDCs, the dose response curves and corresponding
IC50 values were calculated from the scanned images
using the S+ Chip Analyzer. A sensitive response by
corresponding IC50 values was also more significantly
achieved for AZD4547 (FGFR2 inhibitor) and BGJ-398
(pan-FGFR inhibitor) in giant cell tumor PDCs originated
from the right pulmonary nodule under the micropillar/
microwell chip platform using 3D culture as compared to
left (Figure 2B and 2C). The cell proliferation assay was

In this study, we have demonstrated the
effectiveness of a new experimental preclinical platform
for high-throughput screening (HTS) of multiple drugs
combining patient-derived tumor cell (PDC) models and a
micropillar/microwell chip assay based on 3D cultures to
evaluate intrapatient tumor /response heterogeneity. HTS
for 24 drugs was conducted with a micropillar/microwell
chip platform using giant cell tumor PDCs originated from
right and left metastatic nodules, respectively. Using 6
doses per drug in 6 replicates for right and left giant cell
tumor PDCs, the dose response curves and corresponding
IC50 values for 24 drugs were calculated from the scanned
images using the S+ Chip Analyzer. A sensitive response
was more significantly achieved for AZD4547 (FGFR2
inhibitor) in giant cell tumor PDCs originated from the
right pulmonary nodule under the micropillar/microwell
chip platform using 3D culture. This sensitivity was
consistent with the target expression patterns of giant
cell tumor PDCs (FGFR2IIIC mRNA expression in giant
cell tumor PDCs originated from the right pulmonary
nodule was increased significantly as compared to those
originated from left.). Our analysis suggests that PDCs
are useful preclinical models and HTS-platform with 3D
cultured cells on the micropillar/microwell chip using
PDCs might be applied to evaluate intrapatient tumor /
response heterogeneity.
We compared the outcomes between the HTSplatform with 3D cultured cells on the micropillar/
microwell chip and a conventional MTT assay with 2D

cultured cells. For PDC models derived from right and
left metastatic nodules of a patient with giant cell tumor,
the IC50 values of AZD4547 were evaluated using these
two methods. The IC50 values of drugs tested against 3D
cultured PDCs on the chip could divide two PDC models
(right vs. left) according to molecular heterogeneity.
However, a conventional MTT assay with 2D cultured
cells didn’t draw the response heterogeneity to drug for
two PDC models (right vs. left) according to molecular
heterogeneity. This discrepancy may be caused by
the difference of reflections for tumor heterogeneity,
microenvironments, and phamacogenomic information
between 2D- and 3D-cultured cells. The difference in IC50
values between 3D and 2D cell culture systems has already
been reported and is considered a distinctive characteristic
of cells cultured in 3D systems [16, 17]. Culturing human
primary cells from patients under conditions more similar
to those in vivo, such as 3D microenvironments, can
potentially provide valuable insight into in vivo drug
efficacy as the 3D cell cultures can maintain specific
biomedical and morphological features that resemble
those of the corresponding tumor. Conventional HTS
has been based on two-dimensional (2D) cell monolayer

cultures [18]. The formation of tumor-like 3D structures
is strongly inhibited in 2D monolayer cultures by the
strong affinity of cells for most artificial surfaces and the
restriction to a 2D space. Thus, the results of HTS based
on 3D cell cultures might reflect far better the relation
between the tumor-biology and the matched targeted agent
as compared to a conventional 2D cultured MTT assay.
In addition to interpatient response heterogeneity,
understanding intrapatient response heterogeneity is also
essential for designing effective therapeutic strategies in
the era of precision medicine [19]. The functional impact
of intrapatient heterogeneity on cancer remains to be
fully understood. Intrapatient heterogeneity influences the
dynamic tumor landscape and plays a key role in shaping
response to specific therapies [20, 21]. The difference in
sensitivity to specific drugs between PDCs originating
from right and left metastatic lesions may be caused by
intertumor heterogeneity, i.e., the presence of different
genetic alterations in different metastatic tumors from
a single patient (Figure 3). With the advent of therapies
targeting specific oncogenes, it is possible to use mutation
detection strategies aimed at these oncogenes to assess
tumor specimens for intertumor heterogeneity. Such

heterogeneity is potentially important because it has been
shown to affect responses to molecularly targeted treatments
in cancers. Although we clearly recognize the significance
of intertumor heterogeneity for realizing precision medicine,
it is not easy to overcome it. It is impossible to perform
molecular profiling of multiple metastatic lesions from
the same patient to evaluate the presence of intertumoral

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

heterogeneity because of the high cost. Thus, a HTS
platform based on 3D culture of PDCs on micropillar/
microwell chips might be a useful approach for evaluating
the presence of intertumoral heterogeneity. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the intrapatient
tumor/response heterogeneity through HTS on the 3D cell
culture micropillar/microwell chip platform using PDCs.

Giant cell tumor is an aggressive bone tumor
consisting of multinucleated osteoclast-like giants
cells and proliferating osteoblast-like stromal cells.
Previous study using giant cell stromal cells from
patient specimens demonstrated that FGFR2 signaling
plays an essential role in bone development and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

promotes differentiation of immature osteoblastic
cells [13]. They specifically showed that FGFR2-IIIC
overexpression in GCT stromal cells was correlated
with activation of FGF signaling pathway leading to
osteoblastic differentiation. As shown in Figure 3,
only right lung nodule had FGFR2 IIIC overexpression

whereas FGFR2 IIIC was not overexpressed in left
lung nodule. Osteopontin, a marker for osteoblastic
differentiation, was increased by FGF ligand only in
right lung. Hence, the sensitivity to FGFR2 inhibitor
may be related to baseline FGFR2 IIIC expression
level and possibly related to baseline osteoblastic
differentiation level in each nodule which is aligned
with previous report [13].
In conclusion, An HTS platform based on 3D
culture on micropillar/microwell chips and PDC models
could be applied as a useful preclinical tool to evaluate
the intrapatient tumor/response heterogeneity. This
platform based on 3D culture might reflect far better
the relation between the tumor-biology and the matched

metastatic lesions of a single patient. Collected tissue
was minced and dissociated by enzymatic methods.
Right and left giant cell tumor patient-derived cells
(PDCs) were cultured. The cells were grown in RPMI
1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS;
Gibco BRL, Paisley, UK) and 1% antibiotic-anti-mycotic
solution (Gibco BRL). The medium was changed every 3
days, and cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified
5% CO2 incubator. PDCs were passaged using TrypLE
Express (Gibco BRL) to detach cells when they reached
80–90% confluence.

DNA/RNA extractions
Cultured cells (passage 1 to 2) were harvested
with TrypLE Express. Genomic DNA was isolated using
a QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, GmBH, Hilden,
Germany) and total RNA was isolated with an RNeasy
Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The concentrations of genomic DNA and
RNA were measured using a NanoDrop ND-100 (Nano
Drop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). Genomic
DNA and RNA were stored at –80°C.

High-throughput screening (HTS) of PDCs
originated from right and left metastatic
pulmonary nodules in the same patient on a
micropillar/microwell chip platform

Cell treatment and viability assay
After pathologic confirmation, cells were seeded at
a density of 1–2 × 106 cells/10-mm dish or 5,000 cells/
well in 96-well plates for immunoblot analysis and cell
proliferation assays and treated for 3–5 days with various
doses of drugs, as indicated. Inhibition of cell proliferation
was determined using Cell Titer Glo (Promega, Madison,
WI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Sixteen cultured two giant cell tumor PDCs (Right
vs. Left) were seeded into 3D culture media consisting
of DMEM F/12 containing 1% antibiotic-antimycotic
solution, 10 mM HEPES, B27, N2, Glutamax (Gibco
BRL), 10 nM human gastrin I, 1 mM N-acetyl-Lcysteine (Sigma Aldrich), 10 μg/ml insulin, 20 ng/ml
bFGF, and 50 ng/ml EGF (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ,
USA). After 3–5 days, the tissues were dissociated into
single cells using accutase (Gibco BRL) and prepared
for loading on the micropillar chip. The chip layout
is designed for screening 12 compounds in a single
micropillar/microwell chip, as previously described
[15]. In the micropillar chip, approximately 100 cells
are immobilized with 0.5% alginate (Sigma Aldrich) in
each micropillar. In this study, we tested 24 compounds
(AZD2281, AZD4547, AZD5363, AZD6094, AZD6244,
AZD1775, everolimus, crizotinib, dasatinib, regorafenib,
LJM-716, vemurafenib, cetuximab, GDC0449, RXDX106, PF-02299304, lapatinib, BEZ235, AZD2014,
LEE011, staurosporin, neratinib, BGJ-398) with 6
replicates per sample in two giant cell tumor PDCs (Right
vs. Left), respectively. A 40 nl droplet of cell/alginate
mixture and 950 nl droplet of media or compounds were
dispensed with a S+ microarrayer (S+ Chip Scanner,
Samsung Electro-Mechanics Co., Ltd, South Korea).
After incubation for 1 day, the micropillar chip containing
cells was transferred to a new microwell chip filled
with various test compounds and the combined chips
were incubated for 7 days to test compound efficacy as
described previously [15].

Immunoblot analysis
Total proteins from GC cell lines and PDCs were
isolated using RIPA buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche,
Mannheim, Germany) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail
(Roche), and protein concentrations were determined
using a Quick Start Bradford Protein Assay (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA). Aliquots containing 30 μg of
protein were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and electrotransferred to nitocellulose
membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5%
nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1%
v/v Tween 20, and probed overnight at 4°C with specific
antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit
or mouse IgG (Vector, Burlingame, CA, USA) was used
as a secondary antibody, and signals were detected by
chemiluminescence using ECL Western Blotting Substrate
(Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) and visualized
using LAS-4000 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). We evaluated
the expression of specific molecular markers such as
FGFR2, osteopontin corresponding to two PDCs (Right
vs. Left) used in the micropillar/microwell chip platform.
