Abstract:
The IL-6/JAK/STAT pathway is a key signal transduction pathway implicated
in the pathogenesis of many human cancers, suggesting that kinase inhibitors
targeting JAK/STAT3 may have a broad spectrum of antitumor activity. AZD1480,
a pharmacological JAK1/2 inhibitor, exhibits anti-tumor potency in multiple adult
malignancies. To evaluate the efficacy of inhibition of JAK/STAT3 signal transduction
pathway we assessed the activity of AZD1480 in pediatric malignancies using
preclinical models of three highly malignant pediatric solid tumors: neuroblastoma
(NB), rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and the Ewing Sarcoma Family Tumors (ESFT). In
this study, we employed panels of biomedical and biological experiments to evaluate
the in vitro and in vivo activity of AZD1480 in NB, RMS and ESFT. Our data indicate
that AZD1480 blocks endogenous as well as IL-6 induced STAT3 activation. AZD1480
decreases cell viability in 7/7NB, 7/7RMS and 2/2 ESFT cell lines (median EC50 is
1.5 μM, ranging from 0.36-5.37μM). AZD1480 induces cell growth inhibition and
caspase-dependent apoptosis in vitro and decreases expression of STAT3 target
genes, including cell cycle regulators CyclinD1, 3 and CDC25A, anti-apoptotic genes
Bcl-2 and survivin, the metastasis-related factor TIMP-1 and c-Myc. In vivo studies
showed AZD1480 significantly decreased tumor growth and prolonged overall survival
in tumor-bearing mice. Tumors from AZD1480-treated mice showed inhibition of
activated STAT3 as well as decreased expression of STAT3 downstream targets. Our
study provides strong evidence of the anti-tumor growth potency of JAK inhibitor
AZD1480 in pediatric solid tumors, providing proof-of principle that inhibition of the
JAK/STAT3 signal transduction could be a promising therapeutic target for high-risk
pediatric solid tumors.

Introduction

standard therapies. In contrast, patients with high-risk
aggressive NB, RMS and ESFT have a dismal outcome.
Despite the current intensive therapy, the long-term eventfree survival of high-risk NB is less than 40% [1,3], and
the long-term OS in high-risk RMS and ESFT is only
30% and 39% [4,5,6,7], respectively. In addition, toxicity
from current therapies is significant, leaving little room
for further dose intensification. Therefore, new treatment
strategies are urgently needed to improve the outcomes of
patients with these malignancies.
Targeted therapy to mutant or dysregulated signal
transduction pathway in human malignancies is a recent
approach that has shown great promise when used alone or

Since the 1950s, the overall survival (OS) of
pediatric cancer patients has increased from almost 0
to 80%. However, treatment of aggressive, high-risk
neuroblastoma (NB),  rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and
Ewing  sarcoma family tumors (ESFT) has remained a
challenge. NB is the most common extra-cranial solid
malignancy [1], RMS is the most common sarcoma
and ESFT is the second most common bone tumor
of childhood [1,2]. Children with localized, low- and
intermediated-risk NB, RMS and ESFT are mostly
curable, and have excellent long-term survival rates with

combined with conventional therapies. The Janus kinase
(JAK) signal transducer and activator of transcription
(STAT) pathway is one of them [8,9]. Activation of this
pathway involves cytokine activation of its receptor,
subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular
JAK kinases, then recruitment and phosphorylation
of STAT transcription factors. Phosphorylated STAT
proteins dimerize, translocate to the nucleus, and initiate
target gene transcription. Cytokines of the interleukin-6
family, including IL-6, oncostatin M, leukemia inhibitory
factor, are potent activators of JAK/STAT3 pathway,
predominantly activating STAT3 through JAK1 and
JAK2 [10]. Aberrant activation of JAK/STAT3 signaling,
in particular STAT3, participates in the initiation,
development and progression of human cancers via
induction of STAT3 downstream genes that encode antiapoptotic proteins, cell cycle regulators, and angiogenic
factors such as Bcl-2, CyclinD1 and VEGF[11].
Aberrant activation of JAK/STAT3 signaling has
been found in many adult and pediatric solid tumors.
Increased STAT3 activity is frequently found in a wide
variety of human tumors, including hematopoietic
malignancies (leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple
myeloma) as well as solid tumors (such as head and neck,
breast, and prostate cancers) [12,13,14,15,16,17]. JAK2
mutations are not a major cause of activated JAK/STAT3
in pediatric solid tumors. Instead, elevated levels of IL-6 in
the bone marrow and peripheral blood have been observed
to be an independent marker of poor prognosis in highrisk NB patients [18]. In vitro studies demonstrated that
bone marrow-derived IL-6 increased the proliferation and
decreased the cytotoxic drug-induced apoptosis through
activation of STAT3 in NB cells [19]. IL-6 has not been
directly studied in the pathogenesis of RMS or ESFT.
However, increased macrophage infiltration and tumor
microvascular density have been noted in tumors from
ESFT patients with poor prognoses [20]. Since tumorassociated macrophages express higher concentrations
of cytokines including IL-6 [20], increased IL-6 may
be one mechanism that leads to aberrant activation of
JAK/STAT3 pathway in pediatric sarcomas. In addition,
activation of JAK/STAT3 pathway may be maintained
by its induction of SIPR1, which has been shown to
generate an autocrine positive feedback loop in many
solid tumor cells and a paracrine feedback loop with cells
in their microenvironment [21]. Furthermore, elevated
levels of activated STAT3 are found in ESFT and RMS
tumor tissues as well as cell lines [22,23]. These findings
suggest that the aberrant activation of JAK/STAT3
pathway participates in the pathogenesis of pediatric solid
tumors and targeting key components of this pathway may
represent a promising strategy to treat these malignancies.
To test whether inhibition of the JAK/STAT3
pathway would affect the growth of pediatric solid tumors,
we evaluated the anti-tumor activity of AZD1480, an ATP
competitive inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2, which has been
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

shown to decrease the growth of adult tumors in several
pre-clinical models [24,25,26,27,28]. In this study, we
found that AZD1480-mediated inhibition of the JAK/
STAT3 pathway resulted in in vitro and in vivo suppression
of tumor growth in neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma
and Ewing sarcoma. As a proof of concept this
demonstrates that blockade of the JAK/STAT3 signaling
may have therapeutic benefit for pediatric patients with
these solid malignancies.

Results
AZD1480 treatment inhibited the growth of
pediatric solid tumor cell lines in vitro
AZD1480 activity was evaluated by MTS assay in 7
NB, 7 RMS, and 2 ESTF tumor cell lines and 2 immortal
but non-tumorigenic cell lines, ARPE19 and HEK293T.
After 72 hours, all AZD1480-treated cell lines displayed
a dose-dependent decrease in cell number (Fig. 1A). The
median EC50 in vitro was 1.5 µM. There was a 69-fold
range in EC50 values, with the most sensitive cell line
being the NB cell line SY5Y with an EC50 of 0.36 µM.
The immortalized normal cell line ARPE19 was the least
sensitive with an EC50 of 24.4 µM. As Figure 1B and Table
1 showed, 5/7 NB and 1/7 RMS cell lines were relatively
more sensitive to AZD1480 with the Panel EC50/Median
EC50 less than 0.5; 2/7 NB and 3/7 RMS showed median
sensitivity to AZD1480 (0.5< Panel EC50/Median EC50
<1.5); 2/2 ESFT and 3/7 RMS were less sensitive (1.5<
Panel EC50/Median EC50 <5). The 2 non-tumorigenic cell
lines ARPE19 and HEK293T were the least sensitive
(Panel EC50/Median EC50 >5). This shows that the tumor
cell lines were more sensitive to AZD1480-mediated
inhibition of cell proliferation than the normal cells.
Four cell lines were selected for further in vitro and in
vivo analyses: SY5Y (single copy-MYCN) and KCNR
(MYCN-amplified) from NB which were in group that
was most sensitive to AZD1480; Rh18 (RMS) which was
in the group showing intermediate sensitivity to AZD1480
and TC32 (ESFT) which was in the group showing the
least sensitivity to AZD1480.
To determine the events that led to the AZD1480induced decrease in cell proliferation, alterations in cell
cycle were analyzed by flow cytometry in cells treated
with AZD1480 for 72 hours. As shown in Figure 1C, there
was an increase in cells in the subG1 and G2/M phases
of the cell cycle with the increasing dose of AZD1480 (0
to 2.5 µM). AZD1480 treatment had little to no effect on
cell cycle distribution of the non-tumorigenic ARPE19 cell
line at these concentrations.
To assess whether the AZD1480-induced cell death
was mediated via a caspase-dependent pathway, we
performed a caspase-3/7 activity assay. AZD1480-treated

pediatric tumor cell lines showed a significant increase in
caspase-3/7 activity in all the tumor cell lines tested (Fig.
2A). AZD1480 induced an increase in caspase 3/7 activity
in KCNR, SY5Y and Rh18 at the concentration of 0.5 µM.
However, caspase 3/7 activity did not change in the TC32
cells until the AZD1480 concentration reached 2.5 µM.
In the two non-tumorigenic cell lines, AZD1480, even at
2.5uM, failed to induce a significant change in Caspase3/7
activity. This indicated AZD1480 had a specific effect on
tumor cells. To assess whether the activation of Caspase
3/7 was critical for AZD1480-induced cell death, cells
were treated with pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK
prior to AZD1480-treatment (Fig. 2B). The pan-caspase
inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK blocked, to differing extents, the
cytotoxic activity of AZD1480 in all 4 tumor cell lines.
Compared to the AZD1480-treated group, Z-VAD-FMK
treatment significantly rescued survival (Fig. 2B). These
data indicate that AZD1480 induces caspase-dependent
cell death in these 4 pediatric solid tumor cell lines.

inhibited the constitutive levels of activated JAK2 and
activated STAT3 without changing the total protein
levels of JAK2 and STAT3 (Fig 3A). Since studies
indicated that bone marrow-derived IL-6 increased the
proliferation and decreased the cytotoxic drug-induced
apoptosis through activation of STAT3 in NB cells [19],
we evaluated whether AZD1480 would affect this signal
transduction pathway. As shown in supplementary Figure
1A, IL-6Rα/gp80 protein was detected in 8/8 and gp130
protein expression was detected in 7/8 cell lines. IL-6
was detected in the conditioned medium of 4/8 cell lines
(Supplementary Fig. 1B). AZD1480 inhibited the IL6-induced activation of JAK/STAT3 signaling in vitro
(Figure 3B). To determine whether inhibition of STAT3
phosphorylation affected STAT3 target gene expression,
we analyzed the expression of selected STAT3 direct target
genes (CyclinD1, CyclinD3, Cdc25a, Bcl-2, survivin,
TIMP-1 and c-Myc) by qPCR and immunoblots. After
24 hours of AZD1480-treatment, there was a significant
decrease in the mRNA levels of 6/7 STAT3 target genes
in KCNR and SY5Y, and 7/7 STAT3 in Rh18 and TC32
(Fig. 3C). The protein levels of selected STAT3 targets
decreased, albeit to variable levels (Fig. 3D). We also
detected a significant decrease in the levels of secreted
VEGF in 7/8 tumor cell lines tested (Supplementary
Fig 2). AZD1480 also inhibited the migration ability of
KCNR and TC32 cells but not of SY5Y and Rh18 cells
using a wound closure assay (Supplementary Fig 3). These
data indicates that consistent with the decreased STAT3

AZD1480 inhibited both endogenous constitutive
and IL-6-induced STAT3 activation in pediatric
cells
As an ATP competitive inhibitor of JAK1 and
JAK2, AZD1480 was recently shown to inhibit activation
of STAT3 and depress the growth of multiple adult
tumors [25,26]. AZD1480 (0, 0.5, 1, 2.5 µM) treatment

target genes involved in cell-cycle regulation (CyclinD1,
CyclinD3, Cdc25a), apoptosis (Bcl-2, survivin and c-Myc)
as well as genes implicated in migration and invasion

in AZD1480-treated group was significantly depressed
compared to control in each cell line (P< 0.001 using a
two-way ANOVA). To evaluate the effect of AZD1480
on STAT3 activation in vivo, we collected tumor
samples from mice after 9-doses of AZD1480 or vehicle.
Western blot analyses revealed that tumors from mice
treated with AZD1480 had decreased levels of tyrosine
phosphorylated STAT3 as well as of STAT3 downstream
targets (CyclinD1,-3, Bcl-2 and Survivin) compared to the
levels in tumors from mice receiving vehicle (Fig, 4B).
This shows that AZD1480 treatment induces the inhibition
of STAT3 activity and its target gene expression in vivo.
After AZD1480 treatments were stopped, mice were
euthanized when tumor growth reached a diameter of 2 cm.

of AZD1480 treatment until mice were euthanized
indicated that there was a significant survival advantage
for the AZD1480-treated mice in groups bearing KCNR
(P=0.006), SY5Y (P=0.001), Rh18 (P=0.001) and TC32
(P=0.001) tumors compared with mice that had received
the vehicle control (Fig 5A). The median survival date
was markedly increased for mice in the AZD1480-treated
cohort vs. vehicle control in all tumor models evaluated:
KCNR (29.5 vs. 15 days); SY5Y (46 vs. 19 days); Rh18
(51 vs. 26 days) and TC32 (26.5 vs. 8 days). These data
indicated that AZD1480 treatment significantly reduced
the tumor burden and prolonged the survival of tumorbearing mice in the NB xenografts (KCNR and SY5Y)
grown in a heterotypic site as well as the RMS (Rh18) and
ESFT (TC32) xenografts grown in orthotopic sites.
Western blot analyses of proteins taken from tumors

obtain at time of euthanasia were used to evaluate changes
in gene expression (Fig. 5B). We observed a decrease in
several STAT-3 targets such as, CyclinD1, cyclinD3, Bcl-2
in the tumors treated with AZD1480. The H & E staining
of representative tumor xenografts (Fig. 6) and the images
in Supplementary Figure 5 showed that the tumors express
human-HLA antigens indicating the cells in the xenografts
were of human origin.

Discussion
Management of high-risk NB, ESFT and RMS
remains a challenge for pediatric oncologists. Effective,
targeted therapies with differing toxicity profiles from
cytotoxic drugs are needed. Dysregulation of the JAK2/

STAT3 pathway has been noted in a number of pediatric
solid tumors. We found the JAK1/2 inhibitor AZD1480
inhibited cell proliferation via induction of G2/M cell
cycle arrest and Caspase3/7-dependent apoptosis.
Moreover, AZD1480 suppressed the growth of NB,
RMS and ESFT xenografts in vivo. AZD1480 blocked
endogenous constitutive and cytokine-induced activation
of STAT3 in vitro and inhibited the activation of STAT3

in tumor xenografts. This was associated with decreased
expression of STAT3 downstream target genes such as
Bcl-2, CyclinD1 and Survivin in vitro and in vivo.
Currently, therapeutic blockade of IL-6/JAK/STAT3
signaling using IL-6 ligand-binding antibodies, IL-6R
blocking antibodies, or specific compounds that inhibit
the activity of JAK and STAT3 have been tested preclinically for prostate cancer, non-small cell lung cancer,

xenografts of NB were established by injection of 2×106 of NB cells (KCNR and SY5Y) into the right flank of 4-6 week-old female
nude mice. Orthotopic xenografts of RMS and ESFT were established by injecting 2×107 Rh18 or TC32 cells into the left gastrocnemius
muscle of SCID/Beige mice. AZD1480 treatment were initiated when tumors reaches the size at 100-200 mm3. AZD1480 and vehicle were
administered daily for up to 3 weeks (30 mg/kg QD for KCNR and SY5Y, 30 mg/kg BID for Rh18 and TC32) by oral garage. Tumor sizes
were measured three times a week. A) The graph represents a comparison of mean tumor volumes between control and AZD1480-treated

ovarian cancer, breast cancer and colon cancer. Based on
these promising studies, some approaches are in early
clinical trials for the treatment of adult solid tumors (IL6 mAb S0354 (NCT00433446), STAT3 inhibitors OPB31121 (NCT00955812), OPB-51602 (NCT01423903), and

JAK1/2 inhibitor AZD1480 (NCT01112397) which was
recently closed). However, none of these approaches has
been systematically evaluated in pediatric solid tumors.
Herein we provide evidence of the anti-tumor effect of
blocking JAK2/STAT3 pathway by using the JAK2

inhibitor AZD1480 in 3 different types of pediatric solid
tumor models.
The growth of the NB cell lines was particularly
sensitive to the anti-tumor activity of AZD1480 in vitro
with 7/7 cell lines at or below the median EC50. The
pediatric sarcoma cells were relatively less sensitive
to AZD1480 in vitro with 4/7 RMS cell lines (RD,
Rh17, Rh28 and Rh36), and 2/2 EWS cell lines (TC32
and TC71) with EC50 values greater than the median
EC50. However, the growth of the orthotopic RMS and
ESFT tumor xenografts were significantly depressed
by AZD1480. This may be due to the fact that the daily
dose of AZD1480 was doubled (compared to the NB
xenografts). It is also possible that AZD1480 mediated
anti-angiogenic activity [31,32] may contribute to the antitumor effect in the orthotopic in vivo models. In all cases it
should be noted that the mice were only treated for a total
of 21 doses (as specified by AstraZeneca) and a longer
duration of AZD1480 treatment may have resulted in an
even greater increase in survival of the mice.
Mechanistically, we showed that AZD1480 inhibits

the JAK/STAT3 pathway as measured by suppression
of several specific, well-established downstream
transcriptional targets of STAT3 in cells in vitro and
in tumor xenografts in vivo. The decreases in STAT3
phosphorylation and its downstream targets such as Bcl-2
and CyclinD1 and D3 detected in this study are consistent
with findings in previous studies in adult tumors which
found that AZD1480 induces decreases in STAT3 targets
[25,26,28]. Recently, AZD1480 has been reported to have
anti-angiogenic and anti-metastatic activity via inhibition
of VEGF and MMP9 [31,32]. In our study the levels of
TIMP-1 mRNA, a factor associated with invasiveness
and secreted VEGF, a known pro-angiogenic factor,
were decreased after treatment with AZD1480. Thus the
expression of a variety of downstream targets of activated
STAT3 was inhibited by AZD1480. While AZD1480
treatment inhibited STAT3 targets at the transcriptional
level, the decreased mRNA levels did not always result
in similar or consistent decreases in the protein levels of
the various STAT3 targets. These inconsistencies between
mRNA and protein levels of STAT3 targets may be due

proteins in the different cell lines tested. It is also possible
that the inability to decrease protein levels of Bcl-2 and
survivin which occurred in the TC32 and Rh18 cell lines
may be related to their decreased sensitivity to AZD1480
in vitro.
In this study we evaluated AZD1480 as a single
agent. The in vivo responses to AZD1480 were limited to
tumor growth inhibition, as no objective responses (tumor
regressions) were observed for either subcutaneous or
orthotopic xenografts in our study. Activated STAT3
signaling has been reported to be a marker predictive
of drug resistance [33]. Inhibition of STAT3 activity
enhances chemosensitivity of multiple tumor types to a
number of different cytotoxic agents or other targeted
agents [33,34,35]. Therefore, in our future studies, we
will evaluate agents directly targeting STAT3 alone and in
combination with chemotherapy or targeted-therapies such
as AKT and mTOR inhibitors.
In summary we provide the first pre-clinical proof
of concept of the anti-tumor potency of inhibition of
JAK/STAT3 pathway in pediatric solid tumors utilizing
AZD1480. This study indicates that blockade of JAK/
STAT3 signal transduction pathway may be a promising
therapeutic target in high-risk pediatric solid tumors.

Cells were plated in 96-well plates (3000-5000
cells per well) in triplicate, incubated overnight and then
treated with AZD1480 (0.39 to 25μM), or vehicle DMSO
for 72 hours. Where indicated a pan caspase inhibitor,
Z-VAD-FMK (50 μM) (R&D Systems, MN) was added to
cells 3 hours before AZD1480 treatment. Parallel plates
were prepared for cell viability assays using of the 3-(4,
5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt assay (MTS)
assay (Promega, WI) as previously described (34). The
absorbance (490nm) was detected using a Versamax
microplate reader (Molecular Devices, CA). Cell viability
was normalized to untreated cells. The concentration of
half-maximal effective inhibition of viability (EC50)
was determined by using Prism 4.0 software (GraphPad
Software Inc, CA). Each experiment was done in triplicate
and results were averaged.
Cell cycle analyses were as described previously
(34). Cells treated with AZD1480 or vehicle control,
DMSO, for 72 hours were harvested, washed twice
with PBS and stained with propidium iodide (SigmaAldrich Corp, MO) for DNA content determination. Flow
cytometric data were acquired using a Cytek modified
FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, CA)
and analyzed using FlowJo Software (Tree Star, OR).
Experiments were performed in triplicate.

Materials and methods
Cell lines and Reagents

Assay of Caspase3/7 Activity in vitro

Human NB cell lines (KCNR, BE2, SY5Y, AS, NGP,
LAN5 and IMR32), EWS cell lines (TC32 and TC71) and
RMS cell lines (Rh17, Rh18, Rh28, Rh30, Rh36, Rh41
and RD) were maintained as previously described [29,30]
and determined to be genetically pure using a singlenucleotide polymorphism-based genotype assay (kindly
performed by SJ Chanock, Division of Cancer Genetics
and Epidemiology, NCI). Human embryonic kidney cell
line HEK293 and human retinal pigment epithelial cell
line ARPE19 were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA).
AZD1480, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, was synthesized
and provided by AstraZeneca (Waltham, MA). For in
vitro studies, AZD1480 was dissolved as a 20mM stock
solution in DMSO and frozen in aliquots at -80°C. For
in vivo experiments, AZD1480 was suspended in water
supplemented with 0.5% hypromellose and 0.1% Tween
80 (20mg/ml), stored at 4o C and freshly made every
week. Human IL-6 was purchased from Miltenyi Biotec
(Auburn, CA). Antibodies against phosphorylated STAT3
(Y705), STAT3, CyclinD1, CyclinD3, Bcl-2 and Survivin
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies
(Beverly, MA). The GAPDH antibody was purchased
from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA).

Cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density
of 1 × 104 cells per well, in triplicate, cultured overnight
and then treated with 0, 0.5, 1 and 2.5 μM AZD1480 for
another 24 hours. The combined activity of caspase-3/7
was evaluated using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay Kit
(Promega, WI) according to the manufacturer’s instruction
[29]. Experiments were performed in triplicate.

Real-Time PCR and Protein Analyses
Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini
Kit (Qiagen, CA) and reverse-transcribed to cDNA
with SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix
(Invitrogen, CA). The levels of mRNA expression of
STAT3 target gene CyclinD1, CyclinD3, CDC25A, BCL2, Survivin, TIMP-1 and c-Myc in cells treated with
AZD1480 or vehicle were evaluated by quantitative realtime PCR (qPCR) using an ABI Prism 7000 (Applied
Biosystems, CA) with SYBR Green SuperMix according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. β-Actin was used for input
normalization. Validated primers used for detection were
obtained from RealTimePrimers.com.
Lysates of total protein were isolated using
442

Oncotarget 2013; 4: 433-445

Tumor tissue isolated at the time the mouse was
euthanized was either snap frozen and stored at -80oC
for protein analysis by western blot analyses, or fixed in
10% formalin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin–
eosin (American Histo Labs, MD) or anti-human HLA
antibodies by immunohistochemistry. All xenograft studies
were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee
of the National Cancer Institute in accordance with the
institutional guidelines (PB–023).

Qproteome Mammalian Protein Prep Kit (Qiagen, CA)
and concentrations were measured using a BCA Protein
Assay Kit (Pierce, IL). Proteins (15 μg) were separated
by SDS-PAGE gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes. Membranes were blocked by 5% non-fat
milk in TBST (0.01% Tween) for 1 hour, incubated with
primary antibodies overnight at 4o C, followed by 1 hour
incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and
then developed with Western Lighting-ECL (Perkin Elmer,
NY). Densitometric analysis of appropriately exposed
autoradiographs was performed using NIH Image 1.63
software. Relative protein levels (phosphorylated STAT3/
total STAT3, phosphorylated JAK2/ total JAK2, STAT3
downstream targets/ GAPDH) were calculated from
quantified data. Ratios shown under the representative
blots were normalized to that of untreated-control
(normalized as “1”) in each cell line. All qPCRs and
immunoblots were performed in triplicate.

Evaluation and Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with the
GraphPad Prism software. Statistical significance was
established at P< 0.05. Kaplan Meier survival curve
comparisons were performed using a two-way ANOVA.

Oncology Branch, National Cancer Institute) for his kind
assistance with the orthotropic mice models; AstraZeneca
(Boston) for provide AZD1480; Dr. Dennis Huszar
(Cancer Bioscience, AstraZeneca) for coordinating
the supply of AZD1480 and suggesting on the dose of
AZD1480 on animal models; Dr. Stanley He (Pediatric
Oncology Branch, National Cancer Institute) for editing
the manuscript; Dr. Lee Helman (Pediatric Oncology
Branch, National Cancer Institute) for critical review
and discussion on the manuscript. All xenograft studies
were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee
of the National Cancer Institute in accordance with the
institutional guidelines (Protocol Number: PB–023).
This research was supported by the Intramural Research
Program of the NIH, National Cancer Institute, and Center
for Cancer Research.

For NB xenograft model, 5-6-week-old female
athymic nude mice (Taconic, NY) were injected
subcutaneously with 2 × 106 cells (KCNR and SY5Y).
For RMS and ESFT xenograft models, SCID/Beige mice
(4–6 weeks old; Charles River Laboratories, MA) were
orthotopically injected with 2 × 106 cells (TC32 or Rh18)
per mouse into the left gastrocnemius muscle. When
the subcutaneous tumors reached 100-200 mm3 or the
minimum diameter of tumor in orthotropic mice reached
0.5 cm, mice bearing KCNR, SY5Y, TC32 or Rh18 were
randomly assigned into an AZD1480 treatment group or a
control group. The AZD1480 group received a once daily
oral gavage of AZD1480 (30 mg/kg QD per mouse for
KCNR and SY5Y, 30 mg/kg BID per mouse for Rh18 and
TC32) or vehicle alone respectively for 21 days. To detect
the effect of AZD1480 on tumor growth, tumor size was
measured three times a week using calipers and calculated
as previously described: the equation for subcutaneousxenografts in KCNR and SY5Y is (L ×W2)/4, where L =
length (millimeter) and W = width (millimeter); and for
orthotopic-xenografts of Rh18 and TC32 is (D  ×  d2)/6
× 3.12, where D is the maximum diameter and d is the
minimum diameter, respectively [29,30]. To evaluate
the effect of AZD1480 on its in vivo targets, two mice in
each group were randomly selected and sacrificed on day
9 after initiation of treatment and the tumor tissue was
frozen for analysis of protein levels of activated-STAT3
and its downstream targets by western blot analyses. These
mice were not included in either tumor growth or animal
survival analyses.
To determine the effect of AZD1480 on survival
of tumor-bearing mice, we counted the days from the
initiation of treatment (AZD1480 or control) to the
time the tumors reached a diameter of 2 cm (end point
as required by NIH Animal Care and Use Committee).
