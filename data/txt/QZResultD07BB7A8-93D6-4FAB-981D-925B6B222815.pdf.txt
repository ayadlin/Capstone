BACKGROUND. This is a phase 2 study of chemotherapy-naive patients, 70 years
of age or older, with nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were treated with
docetaxel and gefitinib. The primary endpoint was response rate (RR). Secondary
endpoints were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).

METHODS. Eligible patients were treated with docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks
and gefitinib 250 mg orally, daily. Docetaxel and gefitinib were given for 2 cycles
beyond maximal response. Gefitinib was continued until disease progression.
Comorbidities and activities of daily living were assessed (IADL).

RESULTS. Forty-four patients initiated therapy between March 2003 and May 2005.
Seventeen patients (40%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 26%–57%) had a partial
response and 48% had stable disease. The median PFS was 6.9 months (95% CI,
3.95–7.8 months). Median survival time was 9.6 months (95% CI, 4.6–16.3 months).

On univariate analyses, sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance
Status (ECOG PS), and Charlson comorbidities index (CCI) score were predictors
of improved survival. On multivariate analyses female sex was a statistically significant predictor of survival. The median survivals were 22.8 months in women and
4.8 months in men. This regimen was well tolerated, with the most common
adverse events being hyperglycemia, fatigue, and lymphopenia.
CONCLUSIONS. Docetaxel combined with gefitinib is active and well tolerated in
patients with advanced NSCLC who are 70 years of age and older. This paradigm
of treatment merits further investigation as a first-line treatment strategy. Female
sex-specific confirmatory clinical trials with this regimen may be warranted.

T

he incidence of lung cancer in 2007 is estimated to be 213,380
with 160,390 deaths. It will contribute to 31% of male and 26%
of female cancer-related deaths and is the largest cause of cancerrelated mortality in both men and women.1
Eighty-five percent of all newly diagnosed lung cancers are nonsmall-cell lung cancers (NSCLC) and 60% to 70% of patients present
with advanced and incurable disease. For those patients combination chemotherapy is essentially palliative and produces partial
responses in 20% to 35% of cases. However, symptom improvement
has been reported in up to two-thirds of patients.
Phase 3 randomized trials of doublet regimens with carboplatin,
gemcitabine, docetaxel, or paclitaxel have demonstrated equivalence

in response rates and survival, with minor variations
in toxicities.2–10 The addition of a third chemotherapeutic drug has resulted in increased toxicity without
therapeutic benefit.11,12
Although conceptually different, the addition of
gefitinib or erlotinib, both oral, specific, and potent
inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine
kinase activity (EGFR-TKI), to double-agent chemotherapy has likewise failed to improve tumor response
rates, time to progression, or overall survival compared
with chemotherapy alone in 4 large phase 3 trials.13–16
Given these results, we hypothesized that a doublet regimen consisting of 1 chemotherapy drug and
an EGFR-TKI would be similar in efficacy and have a
favorable toxicity profile compared with a doublet
chemotherapy regimen. Because this may be particularly relevant for patients who are 70 years of age or
older, we specifically targeted this population for a
first-line phase 2 trial combining docetaxel and gefitinib.17–19 Here we report the efficacy, toxicity, and
comorbidity analyses.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Eligible patients were 70 years of age with histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IIIB (cytology-positive malignant pleural effusion)/IV NSCLC.
Additional inclusion criteria included Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
(PS) of 0 or 1, WBC 3,000/lL, hemoglobin 9.0 g/
dL, platelet count 100,000/lL, total bilirubin 1.5
mg/dL, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase 2.0 3
institutional upper limit of normal, creatinine 1.5
mg/dL, measurable or assessable lesions as defined
by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST), and life expectancy of more than 12 weeks.
Patients with stable brain metastases after surgical
resection and/or cranial irradiation were eligible.
Patients who had prior chemotherapy or treatment
with any ErbB1-or ErbB2-targeted agent, major surgery
or radiation therapy, within 21 days before enrollment,
any malignancy within the last 5 years (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers or definitively treated cervical cancer), and unstable medical comorbidities were
excluded.
Study Design
The study was approved by the H Lee Moffitt Cancer
Center, Scientific Review Committee and University
of South Florida, Institutional Review Board (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT00231465). All patients gave
written, informed consent. Baseline assessments

included a history and physical examination, standard laboratory studies, computed tomography (CT)
of the chest and abdomen, CT or magnetic resonance
imaging of the brain. Lung cancer histology was classified using the 1999 WHO classification system.20
Patients were treated with 75 mg/m2 of docetaxel
administered intravenously on Day 1 with steroid
prophylaxis and 250 mg per day of gefitinib given
orally. Cycles were repeated every 21 days. Docetaxel
and gefitinib were administered for 2 cycles beyond
maximal response, after which gefitinib was continued without interruption until disease progression,
severe or intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Compliance was checked after each 21-day
cycle with a treatment diary. At the start of each
cycle patients underwent assessment of performance
status, adverse effects, physical examination and,
laboratory studies. Tumor assessment was evaluated
after every 2 cycles by clinically appropriate radiological assessment that included CT scans of the chest
and abdomen in most cases. Toxicity was graded by
the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity
Criteria, v. 2.0.21 Treatment interruptions up to 21
days were allowed.

Assessment of Functional Status and Comorbidity in
Patients Who Are 70 Years of Age or Older
Traditional oncologic functional assessments, such as
the ECOG PS, have a low sensitivity in the elderly.
Only 10% of patients deemed able to receive chemotherapy are rated ECOG 2 or higher.22 Conversely, a
geriatric functional instrument such as the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale (IADL) is more
sensitive and is an independent predictor of outcome
when compared with ECOG PS.23–25. Hence, in our
study we assessed independence by using the
Lawton and Brody IADL scale.26,27 The IADL scale
consists of 9 items: ability to use the telephone,
shopping, food preparation, housekeeping, handyman work, laundry, mode of transportation, responsibility for own medications, and ability to handle
finances.28 Responses to each item were: independent, requiring help, and unable to perform. The IADL
is a patient-filled questionnaire that was provided to
the patient at the beginning of the study, before every other cycle, bi-monthly during maintenance, and
at the time of withdrawal from the study.
Comorbidities have a major influence on treatment tolerance in elderly lung cancer patients.29
Because comorbidity and functional status do not
correlate30 and are independent predictors of mortality,31,32 we assessed comorbidities with both the
Charlson Comorbidities Index (CCI)33,34 and the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale-Geriatric (CIRS-G).31,32

Docetaxel and Ge˚tinib in Advanced NSCLC/Simon et al.

Nineteen comorbid conditions potentially affecting
survival are given a score based on previously published criteria by Charlson et al.33,34 Patients were
grouped according to the following categories (0 and
1 vs 2) based on the CCI score.
The CCI assesses a limited number of comorbidities and hence we used the CIRS-G in addition. The
Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS)35 and its variants31,32 have a structure analogous to the WHO
Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) toxicity scales. This
scale classifies comorbidities by organ systems and
grades each condition from 0 (no problem) to 4
(severely incapacitating or life-threatening condition).
An adaptation for geriatric patients (CIRS-G) was used
for this trial.31 The CIRS-G was completed by 1 of us
(M.E.) on the basis of a comprehensive history and
physical examination and laboratory reports at the
time of study entry.

Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint of the study was response.
Secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and toxicity analyses.
This study used a 2-stage design, with a target activity level of 25% and a null hypothesis activity level of
10%. The sample size calculations incorporated the
Green/Dahlbert rule, which states that the false-negative rate for the first stage will not exceed 2%. To
attain 80% power with a 5 0.05, continuation past
the first stage was contingent upon having 2
responders (CR1PR) among the first 21 evaluable
patients. Overall, the trial called for rejecting the
combination as efficacious if 7 responses were seen
in 40 evaluable patients.

Assessment of Response and Survival
Best clinical response to treatment with combination
was determined using RECIST.36 PFS was calculated
from the date of enrollment to the date of progression. OS was calculated from the date of enrollment
to the date of death. Outcomes were censored if an
endpoint was not reached by the time of last followup or if a patient was lost to follow-up. PFS and
survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier
method.37 Univariate analyses of PFS and OS used
the log-rank test to examine effects of baseline clinical factors.38 The risk factors that were significant at
the 0.25 level on univariate analyses were then examined by the multivariate Cox regression model using
forward selection with an SLE 5 0.15. Statistical
analyses were performed using SAS v. 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Patients
Forty-four patients were enrolled between March
2003 and May 2005. Table 1 lists the baseline patient
and disease characteristics. A total of 151 cycles of
docetaxel and gefitinib was administered (median 4,
range, 1–6). Median duration of gefitinib maintenance was 5 months (range, 15 days to 361 months
with 4 patients still on maintenance).
Response
Response was evaluable in 42 of the 44 patients. One
nonevaluable patient had only 1 cycle of chemotherapy and the other patient had 2 cycles of chemotherapy but did not have the follow-up CT scans to

All 44 treated patients were assessed for PFS and OS,
with a minimum follow-up of 19 months. At the time

of analysis (February, 2007) there were 33 deaths.
Ten patients are alive and 1 patient was lost to follow-up. The median OS was 9.59 months (95% CI,

The results of univariate and multivariate Cox regression for overall survival divided by the specified
categories are outlined below. The risk factors that were significant at the .25 level (gender, CCI,
CIRS-G, ECOG-PS, and IADL) were put in the multivariate Cox regression model using forward selection with selection entry criteria of 0.15. CCI, CIRS-G, ECOG-PS, and IADL were eliminated and the
only statistically significant variable that remained in the model was sex.

HR, 0.08–0.52). The median survival in women was
22.8 months, compared with a median survival of 4.8
months in men (Fig. 2A). Results of univariate and
multivariate analyses are outlined in Table 2.
Eleven patients had grade 1/2 rash and no
patients had grade 3/4 rash. In this trial there were
no differences in survival for those who had a rash
versus those who did not.

Influence of ECOG-PS, IADL Scores, and
Comorbidities on Survival
The median CCI was 0 (range, 0–4). Fifty-four percent of patients had a CCI score of 0, 23% a score of
1, and 23% a score of 2 or more. When the study
population was dichotomized by CCI score (0 and 1
vs 2) there was a statistically significant survival
difference between the lower scores versus higher
scores (12.6 months vs 4.46 months; P 5 .018; Fig.
2B). On univariate analyses, higher CCI scores predicted for worse survival (HR, 2.46; 95% CI 1.14–5.32;
P 5 .02). Patients with an ECOG-PS 0 or 1 were eligible for this study. Fifty-five percent of patients had
an ECOG-PS of 0. On univariate analyses ECOG-PS
of 0 was a predictor of improved survival over
patients with an ECOG-PS of 1 (HR, 0.40; 95% CI,
0.19–0.82; P 5 .01). The median IADL score was 28
(range, 14–28). IADL scores did not predict for
improved survival by univariate analyses (P 5 .24)

ASCO guidelines. N denotes the total number of patients receiving the specified cycle. N denotes the
number of patients having the toxicity.
* 30 patients received cycle 4 and toxicity assessments were available for 26 of the 30 patients.
Hence, 26 were used as the denominator for calculating percentages.

(Table 2). The median total score for CIRS-G was 9
(range, 1–21). There were no significant correlations
between CIRS-G and survival (P 5 .2). On multivariate analyses, however, only sex was a statistically significant predictor of improved survival (Table 2).

Second-Line Chemotherapy
Fifteen patients received second-line chemotherapy
(carboplatin plus gemcitabine, n 5 8; carboplatin
plus pemetrexed, n 5 3; pemetrexed monotherapy,
n 5 3; gemcitabine and docetaxel, n 5 1). Four
patients are still on maintenance gefitinib. In 6
patients, the poststudy treatment is unknown. Thirteen patients received no further treatment and 6
patients received palliative radiation therapy alone.
Six patients received third-line treatment, 2 of whom
were treated with erlotinib without response. Two
patients receive fourth-line treatment and 1 patient
received fifth-line treatment.
Hematologic Adverse Effects
Detailed cycle-wise hematologic adverse effects are
outlined in Table 3. Erythropoietin (EPO) and/or
granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) use
was allowed as per ASCO guidelines.39 Lymphopenia
was the most common hematologic toxicity. Only 1
patient had grade 3/4 anemia. The incidence of any
grade thrombocytopenia was also low. Two (4.5%) of

rile neutropenia (FN) and 1 (2.3%) of the 43 patients
who received cycle 2 had FN. No additional episodes
of FN were noted reflecting the use of G-CSF in subsequent cycles.

Nonhematologic Adverse Effects
Detailed nonhematologic adverse effects ‘possibly or
probably related’ to treatment are outlined in Table
4. The most common grade 3/4 adverse effects were
hyperglycemia (11%) and fatigue (9%). Hyperglycemia was attributed to the use of steroid prophylaxis
with docetaxel. The most common grade 1/2 adverse
effects were fatigue (68%), alopecia (55%), rash
(25%), hyperglycemia (20%), cough (18%), nail
changes (16%), and dyspnea (14%). Notably, there
was no grade 3 or 4 rash in this trial.
Three (7%) and 6 (14%) patients had grade 3/4
and grade 1/2 dyspnea, respectively. Dyspnea was
attributed to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbation (2), new onset pleural effusion (2), neutropenic pneumonia (1), nonneutropenic pneumonia
associated with congestive heart failure (1), bronchitis (1), shortness of breath associated with neutropenic fever (1), and deep venous thrombosis with
pulmonary embolism (1). Two patients had pulmonary infiltrates; 1 patient had pulmonary infiltrates at
baseline secondary to interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
which preceded the diagnosis of malignancy; the
second patient developed pulmonary infiltrates on
treatment in the setting of a frankly progressing
malignancy and was sent to hospice without further
diagnostic evaluation.

One patient had interstitial cystitis, attributed to
gefitinib. An exhaustive urologic work-up ruled out
other potential causes and hence this adverse event
was attributed to gefitinib. Despite discontinuation
of gefitinib there was nonresolution of cystitis and
cystitis-associated symptoms. Interstitial cystitis attributed to gefitinib has been reported previously.40,41
Dose reductions were relatively rare with this
regimen. Three (6.9%) of the 44 patients required
reduction of the dose of docetaxel and none required
discontinuation of gefitinib owing to toxicity. None of
the patients required toxicity-related treatment discontinuation in our trial.

DISCUSSION
This study represents a unique approach of combining a single chemotherapy drug (docetaxel) with a
targeted agent (gefitinib) in an effort to develop
an effective regimen with a favorable toxicity profile for patients who are 70 years of age or older.
The median age for lung cancer patients in the US
is 70 years,42 accentuating the relevance of this
approach.
Enthusiasm for combining chemotherapy with
an EGFR-TKI waned after gefitinib or erlotinib failed
to improve survival when used in combination with
platinum-based chemotherapy regimens.13–16 Our
study suggests that there may be a role for combining a single chemotherapy drug with an EGFR-TKI,
especially in an older subset of patients. In the present study, docetaxel and gefitinib was administered
to 44 unselected, previously untreated NSCLC
patients, 70 years of age or older. Median survival
time was 9.6 months which compares favorably with
the survival times achieved in elderly patients receiving vinorelbine (6.5–8.5 months),43,44 cisplatin-based
combination therapy (8.0–8.5 months),17,45 or erlotinib alone (10.9 months).46 The 88% disease control
rate (PR1SD) in our trial also compares favorably to
the multicenter phase 2 trial of erlotinib in unselected elderly patients with NSCLC reported by
Jackman et al. (51%).46
It is interesting that the elderly specific trials that
used an EGFR-TKI appear to yield superior survival
rates to studies that used chemotherapy alone (10.9
months in the trial by Jackman et al.46 and 9.6
months in our trial vs 6.5–8.5 months17,43–45). This
leads us to speculate that NSCLC in the older
patients may be more dependent on EGFR signaling
than in younger patients. This hypothesis is bolstered
by the recent report by Pham et al.47 suggesting that
smoking history may influence the probability of
having mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase do-

main in exsmokers. In their analyses, patients were
categorized as never smokers (<100 lifetime cigarettes), former-smokers (quit 1 year ago), or current
smokers (quit <1 year ago). EGFR mutations were
detected in 51% of never smokers, 19% of former
smokers, and 4% of current smokers. The number of
smoking pack-years and smoke-free years predicted
the prevalence of EGFR mutations. Indeed, in our
trial 93% of patients were former or never smokers,
with only 7% of patients smoking at the time of
study entry (Table 1). Thirty-three of the 44 patients
had either quit more than 1 year ago or had never
smoked. Hence, the favorable results of this trial
could be attributed to the inclusion of gefitinib in
the regimen. Our trial was conceived, initiated, and
well under way before the relation between the presence of sensitizing mutations and response were
first reported. Hence, correlative data looking at
EGFR mutations or EGFR gene amplification or
increased gene copy numbers by fluorescent in-situ
hybridization (FISH) with response and survival
could not be performed and this we acknowledge is
a major limitation of our trial.
There was a significant survival advantage for
females in both univariate and multivariate analyses
(HR, 0.22; 95% CI for HR, 0.09–0.51; P 5 .0005). This
survival benefit for women was not surprising and
has been previously reported especially for gefitinibbased regimens.48–50 However, the degree of benefit
(HR, 0.22) was surprising. Whether this finding is
secondary to better response to the treatment regimen by women or is secondary to differential tumor
biology in older women versus older men is unclear.
A recently reported national, population-based study
suggests that elderly women with early-stage lung
cancer had better risk-adjusted survival regardless of
the type of treatment, suggesting a differential natural history in older women.51 The study included
18,967 elderly patients with stage I and II NSCLC
diagnosed between 1991 and 1999. Women in all
treatment groups had better lung cancer-specific,
overall, and relative survival than did men (P < .0001)
even after controlling for confounders. That study,
however, evaluated survival in early-stage patients,
whereas our study was specific to patients with
advanced stage NSCLC.
Our patients had a good ECOG PS (0 or 1). On
univariate analyses, patients with an ECOG-PS of 0
did statistically significantly better than ECOG PS of
1; however, this did not hold up on multivariate analyses. In addition to PS, we evaluated the effect of
comorbidities on survival. The level of comorbidity
observed in this trial is comparable to the MILES
study (which compared gemcitabine with a combina-

2027

tion of gemcitabine and vinorelbine in elderly
patients),23 represents a higher level of comorbidity
than the general population of our Senior Adult Oncology Program Clinic,30 and a lower level than the
population of the study Frasci of et al.29 (which also
compared gemcitabine with a combination of gemcitabine and vinorelbine in elderly patients). Patients
with lower CCI scores had a statistically significant
improved survival (median survival, 12.6 months for
CCI score of 0 or 1 vs 4.5 months for CCI score of 2
or higher, P 5 .018) (Fig. 2B). Overall, males had a
higher CCI score compared with women and this difference was statistically significant (P 5 .03). However, on multivariate analyses only sex was a
statistically significant predictor of improved survival
(HR, 0.21; 95% CI for HR, 0.08–0.52, P 5 .0008), leading us to conclude that the survival advantage seen
by females cannot be entirely explained by the
increased CCI scores in males and that sex itself had
an independent influence on survival.

Conclusion
In conclusion, ‘hybrid regimens’ that combine 1
chemotherapy drug and an EGFR-TKI represents a
novel paradigm in the first-line treatment of older
patients with advanced NSCLC. A median survival
time of 9.6 months compares favorably with other
regimens tested in patients over the age of 70 years.
The regimen was well tolerated, with relatively few
high-grade toxicities. The median survival of almost
2 years for women was especially notable in this trial
and is likely to be attributable to sex-specific differences in tumor biology and to the inclusion of gefitinib in this regimen.
