Abstract
The angiopoietin-1 (Ang1)/Tie2 signaling pathway is known
to play an important role in the regulation of vascular
maturation and maintenance of vessel integrity. In this study,
we have investigated the effect of systemic Tie2 activation or
inhibition on tumor growth and metastasis. We found that
treatment with Ang1 delivered via an adenoviral vector
promoted s.c. implanted tumor metastasis to the lungs.
Ang1 treatment did not significantly increase vascular density
in the tumors but induced enlargement of blood vessels in
both the tumor and normal tissues, which increased tumor
cell dissemination into the blood circulation. Ang1 also enhanced the formation of metastatic foci in the lungs when
tumor cells were injected into the circulation via the tail
vein. The effect of Ang1 on metastasis was validated by a
simultaneous treatment with a soluble form of Tie2 (sTie2),
which led to the suppression of Ang1-induced increase of
tumor metastasis. Furthermore, using a highly metastatic tumor model, we confirmed that systemic treatment with sTie2
suppressed tumor metastasis to the lungs and lymph nodes,
whereas tumor-associated angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis were not significantly affected. This suggests that the Ang1/
Tie2 signals contribute to tumor progression by increasing
vascular entry and exit of tumor cells to facilitate tumor dissemination and establishment of metastases. [Cancer Res 2009;69(11):

Introduction
It is well known that tumor metastases, rather than the primary
tumor, are the main cause of lethality for human patients. Tumor
cells spread mainly via two pathways, the blood and lymphatic
vessels. Tumor-associated angiogenesis is required not only for
tumor growth but also for tumor metastasis to distant organs
(1–3), and tumor-associated lymphangiogenesis promotes tumor
spread via the lymphatic vessels (4–7). Furthermore, tumor cells
and/or tumor-infiltrating stromal cells secrete a variety of growth
factors such as vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) and

angiopoietins, which are actively involved in the regulation of
tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis (3, 8–10).
Angiopoietins are a family of four growth factors, which have
opposing actions in blood vascular endothelial cells. Angiopoietin-1
(Ang1) and Ang4 stimulate Tie2 phosphorylation, whereas Ang2 is
a context-dependent inhibitor/activator of Tie2 (11–13). Genetic
analyses have revealed that Tie2-mediated signal transduction is
important for the survival of vascular endothelium and angiogenic
sprouting (12, 14, 15). Deletion of Ang1 results in a similar
phenotype to that of Tie2 knockout (16), whereas mice deficient of
Ang2 display defects in lymphatic vessels. This phenotype could be
rescued in knock-in mice, wherein a cDNA encoding Ang1 was
placed in the Ang2 locus (17). Ang1 has also been shown to induce
lymphatic sprouting and hyperplasia (18, 19). These results indicate
that the angiopoietins regulate lymphatic vessel development.
Tie2 and Ang2 are up-regulated in tumor vessels (9). A soluble
extracellular domain of Tie2 (sTie2) inhibited tumor angiogenesis
and growth when applied locally to the tumor implantation site,
and when delivered via adenoviral vectors, it inhibited primary
tumor growth and metastasis at distant sites (20–22). However, it is
not clear if the sTie2 target involved is Ang1 or Ang2, or both.
Studies using ectopic expression of angiopoietins by tumor cells
have yielded contradictory results about their role in tumor growth
and metastasis. In one study, overexpression of Ang2 was shown to
inhibit tumor metastasis formation (23), whereas in another, Ang2
blocking antibody or peptide-Fc fusion protein inhibited tumor
angiogenesis and growth (24). In addition, Ang1 overexpression in
human breast cancer or squamous cell carcinoma cells inhibited
tumor growth (25, 26), but its overexpression in cervical cancer
cells promoted tumor angiogenesis (27).
To clarify the role of Ang1/Tie2 signaling in tumor metastasis, we
overexpressed Ang1 or sTie2 systemically via an adenoviral vector
in tumor-bearing mice. We show that systemic treatment with
Ang1 promotes tumor metastasis, whereas sTie2 suppresses lung
and lymphatic metastasis, without significant changes in tumorassociated blood or lymphatic vessel density or tumor growth.
Instead, we find that Ang1 facilitates tumor cell entry into the
circulation and exit from the blood vessels to the lung. This
suggests a novel role of the Ang1/Tie2 pathway in tumor
progression by regulating vascular function to facilitate tumor
dissemination and metastasis establishment.

Materials and Methods
Tumor cell lines. LNM35/Luc and LNM35/GFP tumor cells were
established and maintained as previously described (28, 29). Luciferasetagged NCI-H460 and MDA-MB435 tumor cells were established by
transducing cells with recombinant lentiviral vectors expressing firefly

luciferase, and tumor cells with stable expression of luciferase were selected
by limiting dilution (30).
In vivo delivery of recombinant adenovirus and protein analysis.
Recombinant adenoviruses expressing sTie2 (20), Ang1 (18), COMP-Ang1
(31), or h-galactosidase (AdLacZ; ref. 32) were administered via the tail vein
(0.5–1.0e+9 plaque-forming units per mouse). Blood was collected 1 wk after
the treatment, and the serum concentration of recombinant proteins was
determined by ELISA as previously described (20). To examine Tie2
activation or inhibition in lung by the treatment, mice were sacrificed 5 d
after the adenoviral administration and lung tissues were collected. Tissues
were homogenized and Tie2 phosphorylation was analyzed as previously
described (33). Results shown in Supplementary Fig. S1 validated the in vivo
agonistic or antagonistic activity of Ang1 or sTie2, respectively.
Xenotransplantation, tumor excision, and analysis. The study was
approved by the Committee for Animal Experiments of the District of
Southern Finland, and all animal experiments were done in accordance
with the institutional guidelines of Model Animal Research Center of
Nanjing University. Tumor implantation into severe combined immunodeficient mice and treatment with the recombinant adenoviruses were done
as described previously (28, 34). Primary tumors were excised 3 wk after
the tumor implantation. Mice were allowed to recover and analyzed within

5 wk. Internal organs including the lungs and axillary lymph nodes were
collected, weighed, and processed for histology.
In separate experiments, recombinant adenoviruses were administered
2 d before i.v. injection of tumor cells (3.0e+6 cells in 200 AL). Mice were
analyzed for metastasis formation using a fluorescence microscope or
in vivo bioluminescance imaging.
In vivo imaging of tumor metastasis and quantification of
bioluminescence signal. In vivo imaging was done using the IVIS Imaging
System (Xenogen) or PhotonImager (BioSpace) as previously described (28).
After the imaging, the animals were euthanized, and organs of interest were
collected and imaged ex vivo. A region of interest was manually selected,
kept constant for all samples, and quantified as photons per second or
counts per minute using the manufacturer’s imaging software.
Luciferase activity assay. Luciferase activity in blood was measured by
following the manufacturer’s instruction (Promega). Briefly, 50 AL of blood
were collected in an EDTA-containing tube. After lysing RBC, the remaining
cells were collected by centrifugation and then lysed in 20 AL of lysis buffer.
Ten microliters of cell lysate were mixed with 50 AL of the Luciferase Assay
Reagent for light measurement in a TURNER BioSystem 20/20n Luminometer [in relative light units (RLU)]. For measurement of luciferase activity
in tissues, tissue lysate was used for analysis as above.

Immunohistochemical staining. Paraffin or frozen sections (6–10 Am)
were immunostained with monoclonal antibodies against platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1; PharMingen) or LYVE-1 (28, 35).
Quantification of blood vessel number and area was done using Image-Pro
Plus (v5.1.2, MediaCybemetics).
Reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA from cultured tumor cells or
tumor tissues was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Similar amounts of
RNA from each sample were used for reverse transcription (Invitrogen) and
amplification. Specific primer pairs are as follows: human Ang1 (hAng1),
accagtcagaggcagtacatgc ( for) and gagactcttgtgaactcaaacgg (rev); mouse
Ang1 (mAng1), accagtcagaggcagtacatgc ( for) and gtcaatgagaatgttaactgcctg

( for) and cttctccagatgataacctgtgc (rev). RNA without reverse transcription
was used as a negative control. cDNA synthesis was monitored by PCR for
h-actin ( for, agcacagagcctcgcctttgccga; rev, gccaatggtgatgacctggccgtca).

Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was done with unpaired t test or
Fisher’s exact test. All statistical tests were two-tailed.

Results
Systemic treatment with Ang1 promotes tumor metastasis to
the lungs. To study the effect of Ang1 on tumor progression,
we treated mice systemically with Ang1 or COMP-Ang1 delivered
via an adenoviral vector 1 day after s.c. implantation of LNM35/Luc,
and AdLacZ was used as control. The serum level of COMP-Ang1 1
week after the treatment was 1.65 F 0.11 Ag/mL (mean F SD, n = 3).
Treatment with AdAng1 increased Tie2 phosphorylation in the
lungs (Supplementary Fig. S1), which is consistent with the previous
observation (33). Both Ang1 and COMP-Ang1 increased tumor
metastasis. Shown in Fig. 1A are representative images of lungs

from the mice treated with AdAng1 and AdLacZ. Because most of
the mice treated with AdAng1 died at about 4 weeks after surgical
removal of primary tumors due to massive metastatic tumor burden
in the lungs, mice were subsequently analyzed 3 weeks after tumor
excision. Lungs with metastatic tumor nodules were weighed, and a
statistically significant increase in lung weight was observed in the
Ang1-treated versus control group (AdLacZ: 0.20 F 0.05 g, n = 17;
AdAng1: 0.67 F 0.31 g, n = 20; P < 0.0001; Fig. 1B).
To confirm that the increase in tumor metastasis was due to
Ang1, tumor-bearing mice receiving AdAng1 were simultaneously
treated with AdsTie2. The circulating level of sTie2 1 week after
the treatment was 0.42 F 0.24 Ag/mL (n = 15), which inhibited
Ang1-induced Tie2 activation in the lungs (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Tumors were s.c. implanted and analyzed as described above.
Representative images of lungs from the mice treated with AdAng1
+ AdsTie2 are shown in Fig. 1A. sTie2 suppressed the Ang1-induced
increase of metastatic tumor burden in the lungs (AdAng1 +
AdsTie2: 0.19 F 0.01 g, n = 7; Ang1 versus Ang1 + sTie2: P = 0.0004;
Fig. 1B). However, there was no significant difference in tumor
weight between the Ang1-treated and control groups (AdLacZ: 1.80
F 0.30 g, n = 21; AdAng1: 1.74 F 0.32 g, n = 24), whereas the tumor
weight was slightly but significantly decreased in mice treated with
AdAng1 + AdsTie2 (1.55 F 0.26 g, n = 11; AdAng1 + AdsTie2 versus
AdLac: P = 0.03; Fig. 1C). Furthermore, histologic analysis confirmed

www.aacrjournals.org

that in tumor-bearing mice treated with AdAng1, the lungs were
heavily occupied by the metastatic tumor cells in comparison with a
few metastatic nodules in the control lungs (Fig. 1D).
Ang1 induces enlargement of tumor blood vessels to
facilitate tumor cell dissemination. To understand the effect of
Ang1 on tumor metastasis, the primary tumors from the treated
and control mice were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining
for PECAM-1 to visualize the tumor vasculature (Fig. 2A). PECAM1–stained vessels in five microscopic fields of the highest vessel
area (200 magnification) were quantified using Image-Pro Plus.
As shown in Fig. 2A, Ang1 increased vessel surface area
significantly (AdLacZ: 14,246.20 F 1,716.17 Am2, n = 5; AdCA1:
19,962.89 F 3,644.39 Am2, n = 5; P = 0.013). However, there was
no significant difference in PECAM-1+ vessel counts per grid
(Ang1: 117.68 F 41.71, n = 5; LacZ: 108.84 F 16.25, n = 5). As
previously reported (31), Ang1-induced vessel enlargement was
also observed in normal ear skin tissues (Fig. 2A).
To find out when the luciferase-expressing tumor cells start to
invade into the circulation, blood from tumor-bearing mice was
collected for the detection of luciferase activity. We first titrated the
minimal cell number detectable by this assay. Blood was mixed
with different numbers of luciferase expressing tumor cells for
analysis (Fig. 2B). The baseline luminescence reading for blood
samples without added tumor cells was 68.20 F 12.40 RLU (n = 5).

Therefore, any reading above 100 RLU was considered as a positive
signal. There was a barely detectable signal from 5 tumor cells in
the assay, but luminescence signals could be readily detected when
50 cells were analyzed. In the Ang1-treated mice bearing LNM35/
Luc tumors, tumor cells could be detected in the blood already at
week 1 (4 of 8), whereas none of the nine mice in the control group
gave positive signal (Fig. 2C, week 1; AdAng1: 138.0 F 77.45 RLU,
n = 8; AdLacZ: 68.78 F 10.32 RLU, n = 9; P = 0.018). There was a
dramatic increase of tumor cells in the blood from Ang1-treated
mice at week 2 (Fig. 2C; AdAng1: 1,119.2 F 860.51 RLU, n = 5;

AdLacZ: 142.0 F 41.45 RLU, n = 8; P = 0.0071). Consistent with this,
tumor metastasis to lungs occurred in all Ang1-treated mice (5 of 5)
when mice were sacrificed for analysis 2 weeks after tumor
implantation, whereas only two of eight mice showed weak signals
of metastasis in the lungs from the control group (Fig. 2D).
Quantification of lung bioluminescence is shown in Fig. 2D
(AdAng1: 37,363.60 F 36,142.35 RLU, n = 5; AdLacZ: 2,466.0 F

tumor, NCI-H460/Luc tumor cells were implanted s.c. and the mice
were treated with Ang1 as described above. Shown in Fig. 3A are
representative bioluminescent images of lungs from the tumorbearing mice treated with AdLacZ or AdAng1 when the mice were
sacrificed 4 weeks after tumor implantation. Quantification of
bioluminescence showed that Ang1 significantly increased tumor
metastasis to the lungs (photon counts per minute; AdAng1:
2,998.09 F 3,685.26, n = 11; AdLacZ: 162.01 F 229.52, n = 14;
P = 0.008; Fig. 3A). Consistent with this, tumor cell load in the
blood was increased significantly in the Ang1-treated mice starting
from week 2 (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, tumor cell dissemination to
the circulation occurred earlier in the Ang1-treated mice. There
was no detectable signal in the blood at week 1 in either the treated
or control groups. However, more than half of the Ang1-treated
mice (13 of 25) gave a positive signal in the blood, whereas only 3 of
25 mice gave a signal in the control group (P = 0.0054; Fig. 3C).
To further validate the above observation, we also used the
slow-growing MDA-MB435/Luc melanoma model. Tumor cells
were implanted s.c. and grown for 5 weeks before treatment with
AdAng1. Ang1 increased tumor metastasis to the lungs when the
mice were analyzed at week 9. Shown in Fig. 3D are
representative bioluminescent images of the lungs. Quantification
of lung metastasis as photon counts per minute (AdAng1: 4,568.85
F 5,031.62, n = 8; AdLacZ: 539.06 F 1,216.07, n = 7; P = 0.0602;
Fig. 3D) indicated increased metastasis. However, this was not
statistically significant due to a large individual variation, unless
the highest and lowest values were excluded (AdAng1: 3,377.39 F

www.aacrjournals.org

2,150.84 n = 6; AdLacZ: 91.16 F 67.76, n = 5; P = 0.0081).
Quantification of blood bioluminescence revealed a significant
increase of tumor cells in the blood from Ang1-treated mice at
week 9 (AdAng1: 716.5 F 634.35 RLU, n = 16; AdLacZ: 257.3 F
282.34 RLU, n = 15; P = 0.016).
Ang1 enhances the establishment of tumor metastasis in the
lungs. To investigate the effect of Ang1 on the establishment of
tumor metastasis, mice were treated with AdAng1 or AdLacZ 2
days before i.v. injection of LNM35/Luc tumor cells and analyzed
4 weeks later. Shown in Fig. 4A are representative images of the
lungs with metastasis. There was a significant difference in the lung
weight between the treated and control groups (AdLacZ: 0.18 F
0.04 g, n = 6; AdAng1: 0.45 F 0.26 g, n = 6; P = 0.031; Fig. 4A).
In separate experiments, LNM35/Luc tumor–bearing mice were
i.v. injected with LNM35/GFP tumor cells at week 3 after the tumor
implantation and AdAng1 treatment. There was no obvious
difference in initial number of tumor cells in the lungs between
Ang1-treated and LacZ control groups when mice were analyzed
immediately after tumor cell injection (Fig. 4B). However, more
green fluorescent protein (GFP)–positive cells could be seen in
lungs of Ang1-treated mice 1 day later (Fig. 4B), and this became
more obvious when mice were analyzed at day 8 (Fig. 4B).
To further validate the role of Ang1 in the establishment of
tumor metastasis, mice were treated with AdAng1 and AdLacZ
after surgical removal of the primary LNM35/GFP tumors at
week 3 and analyzed for metastasis in the lungs 3 weeks after the
treatment. Shown in Fig. 4C are representative images from

AdLacZ- and AdAng1-treated mice. There was a significant
increase of metastatic nodules in the Ang1-treated versus control
mice (P = 0.0374).
Blockade of Tie2 signaling inhibits lung metastasis. We
found that tumor cells used here expressed Ang1 but not Ang2
transcripts, and both Ang1 and Ang2 expression could be detected
in tumor-associated mouse stromal cells (Supplementary Fig. S2).
To investigate the role of tumor-derived angiopoietins in tumor
progression, mice were treated with AdsTie2 or AdLacZ 1 day after
implantation of the highly metastatic LNM35/Luc cells. The mice
were analyzed within 4 weeks after tumor excision using the IVIS
Imaging system. Bioluminescent signals emitted from the lungs of
tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 5A) were quantified in photons per
second (107, mean F SD; AdLacZ: 39.64 F 52.06, n = 7; AdsTie2:
11.92 F 19.44, n = 17). Lungs with metastatic nodules were
collected and weighed (AdLacZ: 0.36 F 0.13 g, n = 7; AdsTie2:
0.19 F 0.03 g, n = 17; Fig. 5B). There was a significant difference
in lung weight (P = 0.0001; Fig. 5B) and in the occurrence of lung
metastasis between the AdsTie2 and AdLacZ groups [LacZ: 13 of 13
(100%); sTie2: 11 of 20 (55%); P = 0.005; Fig. 5C].
Tumors from mice treated with AdsTie2 or AdLacZ were
surgically removed at week 3 and weighed. There was no significant
difference in tumor weight between the treated and control
mice (LacZ: 1.92 F 0.28 g, n = 12; sTie2: 1.86 F 0.34 g, n = 21). As
shown by PECAM-1 immunostaining of tumor sections, there was
no obvious difference in vessel density between the sTie2-treated

and control tumors (Fig. 5D). However, there was a trend toward
decreased vessel surface area in the sTie2-treated group (LacZ:
13,812.20 F 4,429.91 Am2, n = 6; sTie2: 11,177.08 F 3,769.72 Am2,
n = 6).
Blockade of Tie2 signaling suppresses lymph node metastasis but not tumor lymphangiogenesis. To investigate the role
of angiopoietins in tumor lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic
metastasis, LNM35/Luc tumor–bearing mice were treated with
AdsTie2 or AdLacZ. Primary tumors were surgically excised and
tumor metastasis in the lymph nodes was analyzed at week 7, as
described above. Shown in Fig. 6A are representative images of
axillary lymph nodes from tumor-bearing mice treated with

shown in Fig. 6B [LacZ: 17 of 30 (56.7%); sTie2: 0 of 20 (0%)]. The
results indicate that treatment with sTie2 significantly decreased
the rate of lymph node metastasis compared with AdLacZ control
(P < 0.0001).
Consistently, systemic treatment with Ang1 promoted lymph
node metastasis. The rate of lymph node metastasis in mice treated
with AdAng1 (17 of 19, 89.5%) was significantly increased in
comparison with the AdLacZ group (17 of 30, 56.7%; AdAng1
versus AdLacZ: P = 0.025), and a simultaneous treatment with
AdsTie2 suppressed AdAng1-induced increase of lymph node

metastasis [1 of 7 (14.3%); AdAng1 + AdsTie2 versus AdAng1:
P = 0.0008; Fig. 6B]. Bioluminescent signals emitted from the
lymph nodes were quantified at week 6: AdLacZ (14.23 F 22.06,
n = 17), AdAng1 (48.43 F 86.52, n = 19), or AdAng1 + AdsTie2
(0.62 F 1.64, n = 7; photons per second  107; Fig. 6C). These values
indicate a trend toward increased metastatic tumor burden in
the lymph nodes of AdAng1 treated mice, and the effect could be
suppressed by the simultaneous treatment with sTie2.
Lymphatic vessel density obtained by quantification of
LYVE-1–positive vessels in three microscopic fields of the highest
vessel density was 10.03 F 1.70 in AdsTie2-treated tumors (n = 8)
and 9.40 F 1.70 in the control (n = 7). This indicated that tumorassociated lymphangiogenesis was not suppressed by AdsTie2
treatment (Fig. 6D).

Discussion
In this study, we show that systemic treatment with Ang1
increases tumor metastasis to the lungs through enhancement of
tumor cell dissemination to the circulation and through promotion
of the establishment of metastatic foci. Consistently, we confirmed
that blockade of Tie2 signaling by the treatment with the soluble
Tie2 receptor suppresses spontaneous and experimental tumor
metastasis to the lungs and also the Ang1-induced increase in
tumor metastasis. In spite of the strong effects of Tie2 signals on
tumor metastasis, tumor growth and vessel density were not
significantly affected. This suggests that the Ang1/Tie2 pathway
regulates the properties of endothelial cells in the enlarged vessels
to facilitate tumor progression.
It has been shown that transgenic overexpression of Ang1 in
mouse skin results in enlargement of vessel size without increase
in angiogenic sprouting (36, 37). Treatment with COMP-Ang1, a
modified version of Ang1 with increased potency and solubility,
also induced vascular enlargement and enhanced blood flow (31).
Consistent with these findings, we observed here that Ang1 could
induce vessel enlargement in both tumor and normal tissues. The
vessel dilation effects of Ang1 may increase tumor cell
dissemination and the establishment of metastatic foci in distant
organs. Indeed, we found that systemic treatment with Ang1
promoted tumor metastasis to the lungs when tumors were s.c.
implanted and also when the tumor cells were injected via the
tail vein. The metastasis-promoting effect of Ang1 was not direct
on tumor cells per se because Tie2 transcripts could not be
detected by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) in the tumor
cells, and in vitro treatment of the tumor cells with Ang1 did
not promote their growth.5 It has recently been shown that
Ang1 could up-regulate hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in
endothelial cells (38). HGF, via signaling through MET, is known
to promote normal and neoplastic invasive growth (39). However,
we did not detect increased HGF expression in lungs by
immunostaining or RT-PCR from Ang1-treated mice in comparison with the control.6
In our previous study using LNM35/Luc cells, it was rare to find
tumor metastases in lung if primary tumors were surgically excised
2 weeks after tumor implantation (28). Here we observed that
tumor metastasis occurred much earlier in the Ang1-treated mice,
and tumor cell invasion into the circulation could be detected even

1 week after tumor implantation. Consistently, all mice treated
with Ang1 had metastatic lesions in lungs when mice were analyzed
2 weeks after tumor implantation. This effect is specific because
Ang1-induced increase in tumor metastasis could be suppressed by
the simultaneous treatment with sTie2 (20). Surprisingly, the effect
of Ang1 treatment on tumor metastasis could also be reproduced in
mice implanted with poorly metastatic or slow-growing tumors.
This suggests that the effect of Ang1 on tumor metastasis is
independent of the invasion capacity of tumor cells.
Suppression of lung metastasis by the systemic Tie2 inhibition
shown here is consistent with previous studies (20), but there was
little effect on tumor growth. Although immunostaining with
PECAM-1 did not reveal obvious difference in vessel density
between the treated and control tumors, the vessel surface area
seemed to be decreased by the treatment with sTie2. This
suggests that Tie2 signaling is not required for the angiogenic
sprouting of tumor-associated blood vessels, but rather has a role
in regulating vessel diameter and properties that promote tumor
metastasis.
Although Ang1 has been shown to be lymphangiogenic and
Ang2 plays an important role in lymphatic development during
embryogenesis (17–19), the role of Tie2 signaling in tumor lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis has not been studied
before. We found that systemic treatment with sTie2 dramatically
suppressed lymphatic metastasis. However, tumor-associated
lymphangiogenesis was not affected by this treatment. This suggests a different mechanism from that of VEGF receptor-3 inhibition, which suppressed tumor-associated lymphangiogenesis
(28, 34, 40–42). In agreement with the sTie2-mediated inhibition,
treatment with Ang1 increased the rate of lymph node metastasis.
This suggests that the Ang1/Tie2 signaling pathway is important
for tumor cell dissemination via lymphatic vessels and the establishment of tumor metastasis in lymph nodes.
In summary, we have shown that systemic treatment with Ang1
promoted the formation of metastatic foci in lungs and lymph
nodes, and that blockade of the Tie2 pathway could significantly
suppress both hematogenous and lymphatic tumor metastasis.
This suggests that targeting the Ang1/Tie2 signaling pathway could
be an effective therapy for the treatment of metastatic diseases.
Furthermore, because Ang1 has been shown to promote wound
healing (43) and because it provides a potential factor for the
treatment of cardiovascular diseases, our studies suggest that it
may be better suited for local rather than systemic delivery to avoid
the metastasis-promoting effects.
