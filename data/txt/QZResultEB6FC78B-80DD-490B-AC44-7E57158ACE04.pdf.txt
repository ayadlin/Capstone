ABSTRACT
Structure-based drug repositioning in addition to random chemical screening
is now a viable route to rapid drug development. Proteochemometric computational
methods coupled with kinase assays showed that mebendazole (MBZ) binds and
inhibits kinases important in cancer, especially both BRAFWT and BRAFV600E. We find
that MBZ synergizes with the MEK inhibitor trametinib to inhibit growth of BRAFWTNRASQ61K melanoma cells in culture and in xenografts, and markedly decreased MEK
and ERK phosphorylation. Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) and immunoblot
analyses show that both trametinib and MBZ inhibit the MAPK pathway, and cluster
analysis revealed a protein cluster showing strong MBZ+trametinib - inhibited
phosphorylation of MEK and ERK within 10 minutes, and its direct and indirect
downstream targets related to stress response and translation, including ElK1 and
RSKs within 30 minutes. Downstream ERK targets for cell cycle, including cMYC,
were down-regulated, consistent with S- phase suppression by MBZ+trametinib,
while apoptosis markers, including cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PARP and a sub-G1
population, were all increased with time. These data suggest that MBZ, a welltolerated off-patent approved drug, should be considered as a therapeutic option in
combination with trametinib, for patients with NRASQ61mut or other non-V600E BRAF
mutant melanomas.

INTRODUCTION

target inhibitors or combinations of single-target agents.
Thus, promiscuous inhibitors such as sorafenib and
sunitinib are effective at disrupting multiple nodes in cellsignaling pathways. However, since these agents may have
unacceptable side effects, dose titration is problematic [2].
The latest technologies used for new drug discovery are
in part intended to circumvent these challenges, and while
the number of new molecular entities introduced in 2014
increased, trends in drug development have been variable
[3]. An alternative approach is to utilize available drugs

The paradigm of targeted therapy, the one-drug
one-target disease approach, has issues including the
development of resistance and, thus, there is a need for new
therapeutics to target newly amplified or mutated proteins
[1]. As cancer progresses by multiple pathways, targeting
one pathway alone is usually insufficient. Consequently,
combination targeted therapies have been advocated as
a new approach to cancer treatment using either multiwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and repurpose them for other indications.
Mebendazole (MBZ; methyl N-[6-(benzoyl)-1Hbenzimidazol-2-yl] carbamate), an inexpensive chewable
anthelmintic drug, has been widely used since the early
1970s [4] and is non-toxic even when administered in
high doses [5]. MBZ acts at the colchicine-binding site
of roundworm tubulin, and disrupts its polymerization [6,
7]. MBZ does not cause side effects characteristic of other
anti-microtubule drugs, including taxanes and the vinca
alkaloids [8].
The microtubule-disrupting properties of MBZ
and other benzimidazole carbamates such as albendazole
stimulated interest in these drugs as anti-cancer agents.
MBZ inhibits mitotic spindles, induces G2/M arrest and
apoptosis in human lung cancer cells, and suppresses their
ability to form tumors in nude mice without host toxicity
[9, 10]. However, the affinity of MBZ for human tubulin
is much less than that of roundworm tubulin and it is
unlikely that circulating MBZ levels would ever reach
levels sufficient to block human tubulin in vivo. In addition
to targeting tubulin, studies by our lab and others revealed
that MBZ inhibits VEGFR-2, PDGFRA and PDGFRB at
3600 nM, 820 nM and 660 nM, respectively [11-13]. MBZ
inhibits growth of melanoma cell lines in vitro and in vivo,
accompanied by changes in tubulin polymerization, BCL2
phosphorylation and apoptosis [14]. While two clinical
trials of MBZ for glioma are currently ongoing, two case
reports for patients with either metastatic adrenocortical
cancer or metastatic colon cancer highlighted evidence
of clinical benefit. In the former case, some regression
in metastatic lesions were observed, and the cancer
remained stable on MBZ monotherapy, with the patient
tolerating treatment without side effects until progression
at 24 months [15]. In the latter case, near complete
regression of metastatic lesions in lungs and lymph nodes
and partial regression in the liver was observed [16]. A
further five patients were treated with MBZ, including
one experiencing a minor tumor response, in a reported
personal communication [17].
Current cancer therapies have focused on targeting
driver mutations, including oncogenic BRAF and
NRAS, which are frequent in melanomas. BRAFV600E
and BRAFV600K are found in 46% and 9% of melanomas,
respectively. Additionally, 10% of melanomas previously
classified as “BRAFWT” tumors actually harbor nonV600E/K mutations in BRAF. In fact, more than 30
mutations of the BRAF gene associated with human
cancers have been identified [18], many of which may
be sensitive to trametinib since these show deregulated
stimulation of MEK1/2. Acquired resistance to the targeted
therapeutics dabrafenib (GSK 2118436a; a BRAFV600E/K
inhibitor) and/or trametinib (GSK1120212; a MEK1/2
inhibitor) is associated with development of additional
mutations, including those activating NRAS. Patients
with melanomas harboring NRASmut/BRAFWT signatures
(~21% of patients) have limited treatment options and are
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

refractory to current targeted therapies.
In the current study, we report that the combination
of MBZ and trametinib suppresses proliferation of
patient-derived melanoma cell lines harboring NRASmut/
BRAFWT as determined by gene sequencing, and
significantly attenuates their growth in xenografts in
immunocompromised mice. Reverse phase protein array
(RPPA) based protein pathway activation mapping and
immunoblot analyses revealed specific inhibition of the
MAPK pathway and downstream regulation by MBZ or
trametinib alone or in combination, within 10 minutes
of drug treatment. At later time points, MBZ+trametinib
induces markers of apoptosis, including proteolytic
activation of caspase-3 and PARP cleavage, increased
caspase activity as measured by fluorometric assays and
increased levels of apoptotic sub-G1 cells. A reduction
of cells in S phase was also observed in cells exposed
to trametinib (by 24 h) or trametinib+MBZ (by 8 h),
concurrent with an increase in G2 by 24h and in G1 by
48h. Thus, these results are consistent with the suppression
of the MEK1/2 by trametinib and suppression of BRAFWT
by MBZ, leading to the combinatorial rapid shutoff of
ERK activity, as well as downstream targets of ERK. MBZ
is therefore a viable nontoxic option that can be used to
increase the effectiveness of trametinib in NRASmut/
BRAFWT melanoma.

RESULTS
In silico repurposing technology and in vitro
kinase assays show that MBZ inhibits mutant and
wild-type BRAF
Efforts to develop drugs targeting mutant BRAF led
to FDA approval of vemurafenib in 2011 and dabrafenib in
2013. While these drugs either used alone or particularly
when used in combination with MEK inhibitors such as
trametinib or cobimetinib have been extremely successful
at shrinking tumors, delaying disease progression and
prolonging survival, resistance to them commonly
develops at a median of 7-12 months typically through the
selection of variants exhibiting mutations in other kinase
pathway members, most notably NRAS. Our refined
TMFS method [12] identified MBZ as a hit with a mode
of inhibition that binds both wild type and V600E mutant
BRAF (Figure 1A, 1B). In addition, other MAPK pathway
proteins including CRAF and MEK were identified. Our
in-vitro assays confirmed that BRAF and MEK were
inhibited by MBZ in the nM range (Figure 1C), with MBZ
inhibiting both BRAFV600E and BRAFWT with a Kd of 210
and 230 nM, respectively, in agreement with previous
results with a kinase screen of MBZ, chosen for its ability
to inhibit colon cancer growth [13].

with BRAF [18], and RAF265, a RAF/VEGFR dual
kinase inhibitor [19], bind to the DFG-out (indicating
the positions of the three key amino acids aspartate,
phenylalanine, and glycine) inactive conformation of
BRAFWT and BRAFV600E at the ATP binding site. In
contrast, vemurafenib [20] and dabrafenib [21] bind to

the DFG-in active conformation of the ATP binding site.
These active conformation inhibitors are highly BRAFselective compared to other kinases [20]. Our structurebased modeling shows that MBZ binds both inactive
and active conformations of BRAF (Figure 1A, 1B). The
BRAF structural model revealed that MBZ occupies the

ATP-binding site and stabilizes both the active DFG-in
and inactive DFG-out conformations. MBZ is surrounded
by residues I463, V471, A481, K483, L505, L514, I527,
T529, W531, C532, D594, and F595, and its binding is
driven by hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions
at the ATP site. An amide proton at the 2-position and a
nitrogen atom at the N-1 position of the methyl N-(1Hbenzimidazol-2-yl)carbamate moiety of MBZ form a
significant hydrogen bond interaction with the backbone
C = O and -NH of C532 in the kinase hinge regions of
both the DFG-in and the DFG-out forms of BRAFWT
and BRAFV600E. The methyl group connected to amide
moiety of methyl N-(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)carbamate
forms a hydrophobic interaction with the indole ring of
W531, and is suitably placed, whereas larger hydrophobic
replacements would create steric hindrance due to space
constraints in the binding site between the indole side
chain of W531 and G534. Two interactions between
MBZ and BRAFV600E, but not BRAFWT include: 1) an
additional hydrophobic interaction between F593 and the
benzimidazole moiety, and 2) a water-mediated hydrogen
bond interaction between D594 and a keto group of the
methyl N-(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)carbamate moiety. These
differences explain the slightly higher Kd value observed
for BRAFWT. MBZ does not interact with the BRAF
lipophilic back pocket, unlike other BRAF inhibitors,
lowering its affinity for C-RAF.
TMFS analysis also reveals that MBZ interacts
with VEGFR2 (Figure 1D), consistent with its structural
similarity to the benzimidazole-urea VEGFR2 inhibitor
(PDB:2OH). However, MBZ showed more potency
towards BRAF (Figure 1C) than to VEGFR2 [12],
probably due to the absence of its interaction with residues
lining the ATP site back pocket, which is more important
for VEGFR2 than for BRAFV600E. In addition, the F918
phenyl ring of VEGFR2 restricts the diversified and nonplanar conformation of MBZ, compared to the W531
indole ring of BRAF. Consistent with previous studies
[14], MBZ also interacts with tubulin (Figure 1E).

strongly with trametinib in both BAK and BUL cells, but
was either antagonistic (at low concentrations) or additive
(at high concentrations) in STU cells. T and D were also
synergistic in BAK and BUL, but not STU, although
maximum inhibition was greater in T+MBZ - treated cells
(Figure 2; Supplementary Table 2, Supplementary Figure
1). Consequently, the MBZ+trametinib combination may
represent a potential therapy in NRAS mutant melanoma
cells.
To determine whether the reduced cell numbers
were due to inhibition of proliferation or increased cell
death, apoptosis and cell cycle assays were performed
in BAK and BUL melanoma cells. Caspase-3 activity
(Figure 3A, 3F), as well as a sub-G1 population (Figure
3B, 3G) was induced earlier, and to a greater extent in cells
exposed to T+MBZ than to either drug alone, indicating
that this combination rapidly and robustly induces
apoptosis. In both BAK and BUL cells, trametinib and/or
the combination of T+MBZ also decreased the percentage
of cells in S phase of the cell cycle at all time points, with
concomitant increases in G2 and G1 phases of the cell
cycle by 8 h or 24 h, respectively (Figure 3C-3E, 3H-3J).

The combination of MBZ and trametinib reduces
tumor growth in xenografts
To determine if MBZ and trametinib are effective
against BRAFWT /NRASQ61K melanoma in vivo, BAK cells
were xenografted into nude mice, and treated with MBZ,
trametinib, or their combination. Two different doses of
trametinib were administered to different groups of mice
daily by gavage (0.1 mg/kg LDT, or 3 mg/kg HDT).
A third group of mice was treated with a dose of MBZ
similar to that used for helminthic infections (40 mg/
kg on alternate days), while a fourth and fifth group of
mice received a combination of MBZ and either LDT or
HDT. These trametinib doses bracket those prescribed for
patients (from ¼- to 7-fold), and our MBZ doses are much
less than those safely used in patients based on dose per
body surface area (BSA; Materials and Methods), and are
similar to those in previous preclinical studies [22, 23].
The vehicle served as a control for the sixth group of mice.
While trametinib as a single agent did not show any
significant tumor-suppressive effects (HDT vs. control p =
0.26; LDT vs. control p = 0.65, Supplementary Table 1),
tumor growth was significantly inhibited in mice treated
with MBZ in combination with either high (HDT+MBZ
vs. vehicle p = .038) or low (LDT+MBZ vs. vehicle p =
.066) trametinib doses, although not quite to a significant
level in the latter case, without loss in weight or any other
obvious adverse effects (Figure 4A, 4B). Remarkably,
the HDT+MBZ combination group remained alive long
after the other arms had been euthanized due to the size
of the NRASQ61K melanoma xenografts at 42 days. Tumors
from xenografts collected at the termination of the

Based on the ability of MBZ to target both mutant
and wild-type BRAF, two patient-derived melanoma
cell lines (BAK and BUL) harboring the same BRAFWT/
NRASQ61K mutation profile and another melanoma cell
line (STU) with a BRAFV600K/NRASWT mutation signature
were exposed for 72 h to increasing concentrations of
dabrafenib (D), trametinib (T), MBZ, or combinations of
T+D or T+MBZ. XTT cell viability assays revealed that,
while all three cell lines exhibited resistance to dabrafenib
except at the highest doses tested, MBZ showed weak
cytotoxic activity as a single agent, but synergized

cell extracts were subjected to reverse-phase protein array
(RPPA) analysis. Unsupervised hierarchal clustering of
rows revealed that the phosphorylation of a number of
proteins associated with the MEK/ERK pathway was
down-regulated by MBZ, trametinib, or their combination,
although the response to MBZ+trametinib (T+M) was
more rapid and robust (Figure 5A). Thus, phosphorylation
of ERK and its downstream targets involved in translation,
including p90RSK, ribosomal protein S6, and eIF4E were
all concomitantly inhibited within 1 h of drug exposure,

cluster (Figure 5A; Supplementary Figure 2A). Levels of
LC3B and Beclin-1, key regulatory proteins that control
autophagy, and known ERK pathway substrates, were

of apoptosis were elevated with time, including the
proteolytically activated form of caspase-3 and cleaved

combination of MBZ+trametinib completely abrogated
ERK phosphorylation, such that phospho-ERK was
undetectable by 30 min of treatment (Figure 5C).
Consistent with the regulation of BCL2 levels by MEK/
ERK [26], BCL2, but not BCLXL levels, were slightly
reduced by MBZ+trametinib by 24 h (Figure 5D). Further,
cells treated with the MBZ+trametinib combination
exhibited marked suppression of the inactivating
phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic ERK substrate BAD
S11 [27], coincident with a time-dependent increase in

trametinib on these two processes (Figure 3).
The potential pathway for early suppression of
phospho-ERK and its targets, leading to apoptosis and
cell cycle suppression was next examined by immunoblot
analysis. Remarkably, whereas the pMEK1/2 S217/221
activating phosphorylation was not inhibited by trametinib
or MBZ alone, their combination completely abolished
detectable MEK phosphorylation within 30 min (Figure

throughout the time course for all treatment groups, the

DISCUSSION

MBZ+trametinib reduces BCL2 levels, as well as BAD
S112 phosphorylation, both of which can be explained
by the inhibition of MEK/ERK by MBZ+trametinib [26,
27], although some contribution by a lower affinity MBZtubulin interaction cannot be ruled out. Additionally, we
observe inhibition of phospho ELK1 S383 at all time
points and treatments, a mechanism previously shown
to mediate sorafenib-induced endometrial carcinoma
apoptosis by lowering MCL1 levels [33] (Figure 5A).
MBZ-induced increase in G2 levels was noted (Figure
3E, 3J), consistent with previous findings in human lung
cancer cells, [9, 10]. Other differences in the response to
MBZ observed previously may be due to the differences in
melanoma cell lines, although it should be pointed out that
the BAK cells used in the current study harbor a difficult
to treat mutation profile.
An important question is whether MBZ and
trametinib can reach sufficient concentrations in patients
to exert the anti-tumor effects observed in our current cell
culture and mouse xenograft studies. One challenge is
the relatively poor absorption of MBZ through the gut,
which has been unnecessary for the treatment of nematode
and cestode parasites resident in the human digestive
tract, where it is believed to function by binding tubulin
with an apparent binding affinity of 19 nM, but has a
much lower affinity for human tubulin (µM range; [6].
However, our results suggest that a major target for MBZ
is in fact BRAF, with a higher affinity (Figure 1C) that
might be obtained in patients. Oral MBZ can reach peak
serum concentrations similar to those used in our current
study. For example, in patients treated with chronic MBZ
for hydatid disease, a dose of 10 mg/kg/day resulted in a
mean peak plasma level of 470 nM, with some variability
between patients (0.34-1.69 μM) [34], matching half
the dose (or 6X the BSA-adjusted dose; Materials and
Methods) administered to the mice in this study (40 mg/
kg/qad; Figure 4), and a plasma concentration equivalent
to an IC80 in our cultured NRAS cells (Figure 2A). We
are currently testing different formulations of the drug to
achieve higher bioavailability and plasma concentrations.
MBZ significantly enhanced efficacy of trametinib at 0.1
mg/kg/day (LDT) or 3 mg/kg/day (HDT). Our trametinib
doses/[mouse BSA] bracket those prescribed for patients
(from ¼- to 7-fold), and our MBZ doses are similar to
those used in patients (Materials and Methods) and
have been used in previous animal studies [22]. In any
case, the trametinib dose-dependent reduction in growth
of the MBZ-trametinib treatment groups is promising
considering the difficulty treating NRAS tumors, and may
work in concert with other drugs. We have collaborated
with colleagues at Johns Hopkins who have identified
a formulation of MBZ with significantly greater oral
absorption. We have also developed an investigatorinitiated Phase IA/B clinical trial using this new
formulation of MBZ in combination with a MEK inhibitor
for patients with NRAS mutant melanoma that is currently

Our previous results [12] showed that MBZ
interacts with VEGFR in silico, which was subsequently
corroborated by other investigators who showed that
MBZ interacts with additional kinases in vitro, including
BCR-ABL and BRAF [13, 16]. In the current study, we
expanded these findings using TMFS to show the nature
of the interactions between MBZ and VEGFR, and with
BRAFWT or BRAFV600E. We also now report the novel
finding that MBZ binds both the active and inactive
forms of these BRAF proteins. The current study focuses
primarily on NRASmut/BRAFWT melanoma cells, which
account for about 21% of all melanoma cases [28-31].
These have been particularly recalcitrant to treatment,
with overall survival times that are shorter than those
of patients with melanoma harboring BRAF mutations,
and do not respond to BRAFV600 inhibitors such as
vemurafinib and dabrafenib. In fact these inhibitors
actually enhance growth of NRASmut/BRAFWT tumors
by paradoxically further activating the MAPK pathway
through induced conformational changes in wild type RAF
isoforms, inducing dimerization, membrane localization,
and activation by RAS [32]. The advantages of MBZ are
that 1) it interacts with both the active and inactive forms
of BRAF, 2) it binds wild type or mutant BRAF with
almost equal affinities, and 3) it has very low affinity for
CRAF, and therefore would not be expected to stimulate
tumor growth.
Consistent with our TMFS and kinase assays, MBZ
is toxic to patient-derived melanoma cells harboring
either WT or mutant BRAF in the presence of trametinib.
Further, MBZ+trametinib strongly suppressed the
growth of BRAFWT/NRASQ61K melanoma xenografts, and
dramatically inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation within 10
min. This also blocked phosphorylation of its downstream
targets resulting in suppression of proliferation, inhibition
of autophagy, and induction of apoptosis; at least in part
via suppression of ERK-mediated phosphorylation of
BAD, ELK1, decreased expression of Beclin and LC3B,
and decreased BCL2 levels. In light of the relative nontoxicity of MBZ, we propose that the MBZ-trametinib
combination is a compelling candidate as a therapeutic for
patients with metastatic NRAS mutant melanoma.
Previous studies showed the efficacy of MBZ in
melanoma cell culture and preclinical mouse models [14,
22, 23]. However, in our mouse xenograft model, MBZ
did not work as a monotherapy, but did strongly enhance
the effects of trametinib (Figure 4). This might be due to
the difference in mutation profiles in our study in which
BAK NRASQ61K/BRAFWT primary human melanoma
cells were used rather than the long-term culture M14
melanoma cells harboring a NRASWT/BRAFV600E
mutation profile in the previous study. Consistent with the
previous study showing BCL2 down-regulation in cells
treated with MBZ, our results likewise demonstrate that

daily and expanded to obtain sufficient cell numbers for
subsequent experiments. Mutation signatures of cell lines
were confirmed by PCR and sequencing.

Drug toxicity assays

MATERIALS AND METHODS

MBZ, dabrafenib, and trametinib were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and ActiveBiochem, respectively. 5
x 103 viable cells per well were plated in 96-well dishes
and allowed to recover for 12 h prior to drug treatment.
Cells in triplicate wells were treated for up to 72 h (based
on initial time course experiments showing maximal
effects at that time point) with different concentrations of
trametinib, dabrafenib, or MBZ alone, or a combination
of MBZ and trametinib. Negative controls were exposed
to vehicle DMSO in the same volumes. Cell viability was
assessed by an XTT assay, according to a manufacturer’s
specifications (Biotium Inc). Reduced XTT was measured
by absorbance at 490 nm on a PerkinElmer Victor3 plate
reader. Cells exposed to detergent served as a positive
control.

Proteochemometric methods
A novel rapid computational Proteochemometric
method called “Train, Match, Fit, Streamline” (TMFS)
was used to map new drug-target interaction space and
predict new uses as described [12]. The TMFS method
combines shape, topology and chemical signatures,
including docking score and functional contact points of
the ligand, to predict potential drug-target interactions
with remarkable accuracy.

Establishment and characterization of primary
human melanoma cell lines

Cell cycle analysis

Human melanoma cell lines were established from
fresh metastatic tumor tissues of consenting patients.
Tumors were analyzed for mutations in CKIT, BRAF,
and NRAS by next generation sequencing. Single cell
suspensions were prepared from freshly resected tumor
tissue specimens by mechanical mincing; no enzymatic
dissociation was used. Viable tumor cells were cultured
in Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium (IMDM)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and
antibiotics. After overnight incubation at 37˚C in 5%
CO2, floating debris was discarded and fresh complete
medium was added. Cultures were fed 2-3 times per
week, replacing half of the spent medium. Melanoma cell
lines were split when near confluence and sub-cultured at
4x104 viable cells per cm2 surface area in flasks. Cultures
were shown to be free of mycoplasma contamination
using the MycoProbe™ mycoplasma detection kit
(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). To ensure that
cultured cell lines were melanoma cells, each cell line was
stained and analyzed by flow cytometry for melanomaspecific antigens MART-1, gp100, TRP75, or melanomaassociated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. All cell lines
were early passages of less than 20.

Cells were collected, fixed in ethanol, stained
with propidium iodide (PI) to determine DNA content,
and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACStar PLus; BD
BioSciences, San Jose, CA).

Mouse xenografting
All animal experiments were performed in
accordance with the guidelines and approval of
Georgetown University Animal Care and Use Committee.
Athymic 6-week old male mice (Taconic) were acclimated
to the Division of Comparative Medicine at Georgetown
University a week prior to xenografting. 3x106 melanoma
cells were resuspended in Matrigel and injected
subcutaneously into the hind flanks of athymic mice using
a 22-gauge needle. Tumor growth was measured with
calipers, and drug treatment started when tumor volumes
reached 100 mm3, after which mice were monitored daily
for drug efficacy, as well for adverse effects, including
weight and behavior. Drugs were administered by oral
gavage. Each testing group contained three to five mice
in each of four experiments. Each tumor from each
treatment group was measured on indicated days, and all
tumor sizes were then normalized to their size at day 0
of drug treatment. All data from all four experiments was
then combined for statistical analysis, to compare every
mouse from each treatment group. The total mice for all
experiments included vehicle control (n = 13), low-dose
T (n = 12), MBZ (n = 12), high-dose T (n = 12), lowdose trametinib +MBZ (n = 12), and high-dose trametinib

Cell culture
Patient-derived melanoma cell lines (BAK and
BUL) with the same BRAFWT/NRASQ61K mutation
signature, as well as a melanoma cell line (STU) harboring
a BRAFV600K/NRASWT mutation were cultured in IMDM
with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in a 5%
CO2 incubator at 37°C. Cell growth was monitored

(AMC, Enzo Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI) as previously
described [38]. Free AMC, generated as a result of
cleavage of the aspartate-AMC bond, was monitored over
30 min with a Wallac Victor3 fluorometer (Perkin-Elmer,
Waltham, MA) at excitation and emission wavelengths of
360 and 460 nm, respectively. The emission from each
sample was plotted against time, and linear regression
analysis of the initial velocity (slope) for each curve
yielded the activity.

+MBZ (n = 15). The results were expressed as the mean
(±SD) of tumor volume in each group. After five weeks,
mice were euthanized; tumors extracts were derived for
immunoblot analysis.

Dosing
Trametinib doses were calculated relative to doses
prescribed for patients, based on weight and body surface
area for mouse and human, using the surface area to
weight ratios (m2/kg) described for mouse (.02 kg/ 0.0066
m2 = 3.0) and human (60 kg/1.6 m2 = 37) [35]. This yields
a similar constant to that calculated by Mosteller for
humans: BSA (m2) = [SQRT (H (cm) x W (kg)]*60 [36].
Our mouse “low dose” trametinib (0.1 mg/kg), adjusting
for surface area = 3 /37* (0.1 mg/kg) = 0.008 mg/kg, is
therefore equivalent to a human dose of 0.008 mg/kg * 60
kg (average body mass globally) = 0.48 mg/person/day.
For high dose trametinib, this is equivalent to 14.4 mg/
person/day. By comparison, the dose for patients is 2 mg
PO qDay. For MBZ, our dose of 40 mg/kg, adjusted for
surface area constants 3/37 (mouse/human), is equivalent
to 3/37* (40 mg/kg) * 60 kg/person = 195 mg. By
comparison, patient doses range from 100 mg one time
(pinworms) to 200 mg/kg per day for 12 weeks (hyatid
disease in children) including doses up to 6 g per day [5].
In summary, our trametinib doses/[mouse BSA] bracket
those prescribed for patients (from ¼- to 7-fold), and our
MBZ doses are much lower than those that have been
safely used in patients [5, 37], and similar to those used in
other preclinical studies [22, 23].

Reverse-phase protein arrays
Cell lysates were analyzed by reverse-phase protein
array (RPPA) [39]. Samples were diluted to 0.5 mg/
mL and dilutions printed on slides in triplicate. Slides
were immunostained with 137 different antibodies
specific for total proteins, or phosphorylated or cleaved
products. Analytes measured were chosen based on their
‘actionability” (e.g. were known drug targets for FDAapproved drugs, drugs in clinical trials, or targets of other
commercially-available compounds), as well as for and
their known involvement in tumorigenesis and cancer
biology and components in key signaling pathways that
control cell growth, motility, inflammation, autophagy,
survival, differentiation and apoptosis. All antibodies have
been pre-validated for specificity by immunoblot analysis.
Intensity values were normalized to that of total protein
for each sample stained with Sypro Ruby (Invitrogen).
Unsupervised cluster analysis http://www.hiv.lanl.
gov/content/sequence/HEATMAP/heatmap.html
was
performed for all proteins in the RPPA using the standard
bootstrap method.

Immunoblot analysis

Statistical analysis

SDS-PAGE and transfer of separated proteins to
nitrocellulose membranes were performed according
to standard procedures. Membranes were stained with
Ponceau S (0.1%) to verify equal loading and transfer of
proteins, and then incubated with antibodies specific for
pERK1/2 T202/Y204, pMEK1/2 S217/221, pBAD S-112,
total BAD, total ERK1/2, total MEK1/2, BCL2 (Santa
Cruz Biotech), BCLXL (Santa Cruz Biotech), cleaved
PARP (Cell Signaling), or GAPDH (Abcam; loading
control). Immune complexes were detected by incubation
with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
antibodies to mouse or rabbit IgG (1:3000) and enhanced
chemiluminescence (Pierce, Rockford, IL).

The results shown are based on a single experiment
in triplicate, and repeated in three independent experiments
with essentially the same results. Data from triplicates of
treatment groups were compared using Student’s t-test or
2-way ANOVA (multiple comparisons) for significance,
and p values of < 0.05 were considered statistically
significant. For tumor sizes, the rate-based T/C (tumor/
control) test of significance was used as described, using
the author’s template [40]. The results are representative
of 3 independent experiments with reproducible results.
For determining synergism, the combination index (τ)
was calculated from single dose-response curves and
combination experiments as τ = xA/XA+xB/XB, in which, for
a given cytotoxic effect, xA and xB are the concentrations
of drugs A and B in the combination, and XA and XB are
the concentrations of drugs A and B that achieve the same
cytotoxic effect when given alone [41]. A τ value of 1
indicates additivity, τ less than 1 indicates synergy, and τ
greater than 1 indicates antagonism.

Fluorometric caspase-3 activity
Cytosolic extracts, derived from pooled floating and
attached cells, were subjected to fluorometric caspase-3
activity assays using fluorescent tetrapeptide substrate
specific for caspases-3 (Ac-DEVD-aminomethylcoumarin
