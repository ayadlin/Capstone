Abstract

Tumor-Stromal Interaction in Tumor Invasion

Tumor-stromal interaction is implicated in many stages of
tumor development, although it remains unclear how genetic
lesions in tumor cells affect stromal cells. We have recently
shown that inactivation of transforming growth factor-B
family signaling within colon cancer epithelium increases
chemokine CC chemokine ligand 9 (CCL9) and promotes
recruitment of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-expressing
stromal cells that carry CC chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1), the
cognate receptor for CCL9. We have further shown that lack
of CCR1 prevents the accumulation of MMP-expressing cells
at the invasion front and suppresses tumor invasion. These
results provide the possibility of a novel therapeutic strategy
for advanced cancer—prevention of the recruitment of MMPexpressing cells by chemokine receptor antagonist. [Cancer Res
2007;67(21):10099–102]

As a model of colorectal tumor progression, we earlier
constructed compound mutant mouse strain ‘‘cis-Apc/Smad4’’ that
carries homozygous inactivation of both Apc and Smad4 genes
specifically in the tumor epithelium (11). The cis-Apc/Smad4 mice
develop intestinal adenocarcinomas that show marked invasion, in
contrast to the simple Apc mutants that develop only benign
adenomas. Like most epithelial cancers, the cis-Apc/Smad4
adenocarcinomas invade the intestinal wall as protruding glands
or sheets, a typical pattern of ‘‘collective migration’’ (12). Such type
of invasion is assumed as an early stage of epithelial cancer
metastasis because tumor collectives or clusters can be detected in
the circulation of patients with adenocarcinomas (12).
In a recent study, we found that the invading tumor glands of the
cis-Apc/Smad4 adenocarcinomas were associated with clusters of
‘‘immature myeloid cells’’ that expressed myeloid progenitor cell
marker CD34, pan-leukocyte marker CD45, and myeloid cell
marker CD11b (13). These cells did not express monocyte marker
CD14, granulocyte marker Gr-1, macrophage marker F4/80,
dendritic cell marker CD11c, T-cell marker CD3q, B-cell marker
B220, endothelial marker CD31, vascular endothelial growth factor
receptor 1 (VEGFR1) or von Willebrand factor, or myofibroblast
marker aSMA (13). Furthermore, these cells did not express
hematopoietic stem cell marker c-kit or CD133.1
To examine the mechanism underlying the accumulation of
these cells, we looked for chemokines that were increased
specifically in the cis-Apc/Smad4 polyps because chemokines
stimulate directed cell movements (see below). Among the
chemokines tested, only CC chemokine ligand 9 (CCL9) was
increased significantly in the cis-Apc/Smad4 tumor epithelium.
Because the Smad4 genes are lost only in the tumor epithelial cells,
by the genetic design of the cis-Apc/Smad4 mice, these results
indicate that loss of the TGF-h family signaling in the tumor
epithelium can promote the production of chemokine CCL9.
Consistently, we found that expression of CCL9 in mouse colon
cancer cell line CT26 was suppressed by TGF-h family ligands, such
as TGF-h, activin, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 4, and
BMP7. We further examined expression of CC chemokine receptor
1 (CCR1), the cognate receptor for CCL9, and found that the CD34+
immature myeloid cells at the invasion front express CCR1 and
migrate toward its ligand CCL9.
We then assessed the role of CCR1 in recruiting CD34+ immature
myeloid cells toward the polyps. To this end, we introduced a
homozygous Ccr1 knockout mutation into the cis-Apc/Smad4 mice
and found that lack of CCR1 prevents the accumulation of
immature myeloid cells at the invasion front. Importantly, the loss
of CCR1 dramatically suppressed tumor invasions into the smooth
muscle layer and serosa in the cis-Apc/Smad4 mice. Because
immature myeloid cells at the invasion front showed gelatinolytic

Introduction
Adenocarcinomas develop progressively from epithelial cells that
accumulate genetic lesions. A representative example in the
multistep tumor progression is seen in colon cancer. Namely,
most colorectal adenomas are initiated by inactivation of the APC
gene in the epithelial cells and progress into malignant adenocarcinomas through additional genetic alterations in the K-ras, p53,
SMAD4, and transforming growth factor-h (TGF-h) receptor type II
(TGFBR2) genes (1). These genetic lesions can contribute to tumor
progression through increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis in the tumor cells themselves.
In addition to these cell autonomous changes, it has been
recognized that the stromal cells and extracellular matrix (ECM)
surrounding the tumor epithelium play key roles in multiple steps
of tumor development (2–4). For example, tumor-infiltrating
leukocytes contribute to skin carcinogenesis (5), and cancerassociated fibroblasts (CAF) stimulate prostate tumor formation
(6), not to mention the essential roles of angiogenesis in tumor
growth (7, 8). CAFs also promote the growth of breast cancer
xenografts (9). Furthermore, depletion of tumor-associated macrophages reduces metastasis in a breast cancer mouse model (10),
suggesting that the stromal cells affect not only tumor initiation
and growth but also its metastasis. However, precise roles of the
stromal cells in tumor invasion, apparently the first step in
metastasis, have not been understood. It also remains unclear how
genetic lesions in the tumor epithelial cells, such as inactivation of
the SMAD4 or TGFBR2 genes, induce stromal cell accumulation
and activation.

activities and expressed matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 and
MMP9, these results indicate that the immature myeloid cells help
tumor invasion, at least in part through the production of MMPs.
Taken together, our recent findings indicate that loss of TGF-h
family signaling within tumor epithelium stimulates chemokine
CCL9 secretion, which results in the accumulation of CCR1+
immature myeloid cells that help tumor invasion (Fig. 1).
Because the invasion mechanism of the primary colon cancers
and that of the metastatic lesions are likely to be similar (14),
micrometastatic and colonizing cancer cells may also depend on
the immature myeloid cells for invasion into the parenchyma of the
target tissues. It should be investigated whether CCR1+ immature
myeloid cells are also recruited to the metastatic lesions and help
metastatic invasion in human colon cancer.

Bone Marrow–Derived Myeloid Cells in Cancer
Whereas CCR1+ immature myeloid cells assist tumor invasion,
other types of myeloid cells can also contribute to the tumor
growth and metastasis. For example, CD11b+ monocytes that
express Tie-2 angiopoietin receptor promote angiogenesis and
subsequent tumor growth (15). Hematopoietic cells expressing
CD11b and a granulocyte marker Gr-1 also promote tumor growth
by increasing angiogenesis and vasculogenesis (16). Interestingly, a

subset of perivascular progenitor cells that express CD11b differentiates into pericytes and stabilizes tumor vessels (17). Furthermore, hematopoietic progenitor cells that express CD11b and
VEGFR1 cluster at the premetastatic sites and support tumor
metastasis (18).
In the intestinal polyps of the cis-Apc/Smad4 mice, however, the
CCR1+ immature myeloid cells at the invasion front seem different
from these cells because they do not express VEGFR1 or Gr-1. One
of the important mechanisms that recruit CCR1+ immature
myeloid cells to the invasion front is increased secretion of its
ligand CCL9 from the cancer epithelium caused by the block in the
Smad4 signaling. The mechanisms that mediate recruitment of
other bone marrow–derived myeloid cells described above are
unclear and remain to be investigated. Once the ligand receptor
systems are identified for such cells, these cells may also become
novel therapeutic targets to inhibit their recruitment (see below).

Chemokines and Chemokine Receptors in Cancer
As mentioned above, we have revealed that immature myeloid
cells in the intestinal polyps are recruited by chemokine CCL9.
Although it has been reported that breast cancer cells release
colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) and recruit macrophages to the
tumor (10, 19), we found no expression of CSF-1 in the cis-Apc/

Figure 1. SMAD4-deficient tumor cells produce chemokine CCL9 and recruit the receptor-expressing cells that promote tumor invasion. i, the inactivation of the
TGF-h family signaling within the tumor epithelium causes increased production of chemokine CCL9 because it is suppressed by TGF-h, activin-A, and BMPs.
ii, increased levels of CCL9 recruit immature myeloid cells that carry the CCL9 receptor CCR1 from the blood to the tumor invasion front. These immature myeloid cells
produce MMP9 and MMP2 (iii ) and help the tumor epithelium to migrate and invade into the stroma en masse (iv ).

Smad4 polyps (13), excluding its contribution to the recruitment of
the CCR1+ immature myeloid cells.
Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines that direct the migration
of chemokine receptor-expressing cells. Although originally identified for leukocyte trafficking in infections, the chemokinechemokine receptor system plays important roles in organ-specific
tumor metastasis. For example, tumor cells from various types of
cancer carry chemokine receptor CXCR4 and metastasize to the
bone and lung, where its ligand CXCL12 is expressed (20).
Furthermore, we have shown that CXCR3 expressed on melanoma
and colon cancer cells promotes their metastasis to the lymph
nodes but not to the lung (21, 22). These results collectively suggest
that distinct chemokine receptors control metastasis of tumor cells
to specific organs (e.g., CXCR3 to the lymph nodes and CXCR4
mainly to the lung and bone). In addition to metastasis, tumor
promotion and growth are also aided by chemokines. Namely,
CXCL14 helps recruitment of macrophages that promote hyperplastic tumors in the stomach (23). In a breast cancer xenograft
model, CXCL12 promotes angiogenesis by recruiting endothelial
progenitor cells and stimulates tumor growth (9). Our recent study
has revealed an additional role of chemokines in tumor development (i.e., promotion of tumor invasion by CCL9). These reports
clearly indicate that chemokine-chemokine receptor interactions
play important roles at various stages in tumor development.
In cancer tissues, the major source of chemokines, including
CXCL12, seems to be the stromal cells, such as fibroblasts and
leukocytes, although it remains unclear how genetic alterations in
tumor cells cause the stromal cells to secrete chemokines. Our
study has shown that the tumor epithelial cells can secrete
chemokine CCL9 through inactivation of the TGF-h family
signaling. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that a
genetic lesion (i.e., loss of Smad4 gene in the tumor epithelial cells)
can promote chemokine production that contributes to tumor
invasion. Interestingly, another CC chemokine, CCL2, is produced
by the tumor epithelium of human ovarian cancer and correlates
with the extents of leukocyte infiltration and tumor progression
(20). These results suggest that recruitment of leukocytes by tumor
cells themselves can promote tumor progression in various types of
cancer and that chemokines and their receptors may provide novel
therapeutic targets.

CCR1 Antagonists
Although most primary tumors can be resected surgically, their
metastatic spreads are often lethal. If the tumor invasion at
the metastatic sites is also helped by CCR1+ immature myeloid
cells, it should be possible to treat or prevent it with CCR1
antagonists.
It has been reported that CCR1 binds several chemokines,
including CCL3, CCL5, CCL7, as well as CCL9, and is associated
with various autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis,
rheumatoid arthritis, and organ transplant rejection (24). Therefore, some pharmaceutical companies have developed CCR1
antagonists and are testing some compounds in phase II clinical
trials for multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis (24).
Among the reported CCR1 antagonists, one of well-characterized
compounds seems to be BX471 developed by Berlex. In competitive
binding assays, BX471 inhibits in a dose-dependent manner the
binding of CCL3, CCL5, and CCL7 to human CCR1 with K i value of
2.8, 1.0, and 5.5 nmol/L, respectively (24). Furthermore, BX471
suppresses human leukocyte migration stimulated by the CCR1

www.aacrjournals.org

ligands, but not those by ligands of CCR2, CCR5, or CXCR4,
suggesting that it is a functional antagonist with selective specificity
to CCR1. Using animal models of autoimmune diseases, many
reports suggest the efficacy of this compound as therapeutics.
Namely, BX471 reduces a clinical score in a rat experimental allergic
encephalomyelitis model of multiple sclerosis (25) and blocks rat
heart transplant rejection in combination with cyclosporine (26).
Because some CCR1 antagonists, including BX471, have already
been tested for their safety, we can advocate these compounds as
potential drug candidates for colon cancer progression.

From ‘‘Molecular Target’’ Therapy to ‘‘Cellular
Target’’ Therapy
As described above, lack of CCR1 prevented the accumulation of
MMP-expressing cells at the invasion front and suppressed tumor
invasion in the cis-Apc/Smad4 mice. Similar to the cis-Apc/Smad4
polyps, the CCR1+ cells that expressed MMP9 infiltrated at the
invasion front of some human colon cancers with TGFBR2
mutations (13), suggesting the key roles of the stromal cells that
express MMPs in invasion. Accordingly, these results provide a
novel strategy for cancer therapy that targets the ‘‘assisting stromal
cells’’ using chemokine receptor antagonists to prevent accumulation of the MMP-expressing cells.
Because MMPs degrade the ECM that separates tumor
epithelium from the initially normal stroma, they contribute to
the tumor invasion and subsequent metastasis. Consistent with
this notion, many clinical studies of colon cancer have shown that
expression levels of MMP2 and MMP9 correlate with tumor
progression (27). However, the attempts to block MMPs directly to
prevent tumor progression have failed in the extensive phase III
clinical trials. Almost all MMP inhibitors from multiple companies
could not show clinical efficiency. Even worse, some compounds
had severe side effects, such as inflammation, musculoskeletal
pain, and joint strictures (28–30).
In retrospect, the attempts to inhibit MMPs failed because they
cleave not only ECM components but also many other proteins,
including growth factor binding proteins, cytokine precursors, and
chemokines (30). The proteolysis of these MMP substrates results
in the release and/or activation of secreted factors that stimulate
stomal cell infiltration and proliferation. Therefore, it is not
surprising that systemic and prolonged inhibition of MMP
activities causes aberrant immune responses and other stromal
reactions. The ineffectiveness of MMP inhibitors may be explained
partly by the recent findings that cancer stromal cells have nonMMP proteinases that degrade ECM, such as cathepsins (31) and
uPARAP/Endo 180 (32).
Compared with the systemic ‘‘molecular target’’ therapy using
MMP inhibitors, the ‘‘cellular target’’ therapy using CCR1
antagonists may cause much less side effects because chemokines affect only tissue-specific and therefore localized cell
migration. Consistently, a mouse study indicates that the effect
of CCR1 deficiency is rather benign unless the mice are infected
(33). Instead of direct and systemic inhibition of MMPs, the
blockade of MMP-producing cell accumulation by CCR1 antagonists might help improve management of some advanced
tumors.
