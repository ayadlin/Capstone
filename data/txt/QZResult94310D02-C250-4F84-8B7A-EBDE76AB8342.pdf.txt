ABSTRACT
Point mutations in the ABL1 kinase domain are an important mechanism of
resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in BCR-ABL1-positive and, as recently
shown, BCR-ABL1-like leukemias. The cell line Ba/F3 lentivirally transduced with
mutant BCR-ABL1 constructs is widely used for in vitro sensitivity testing and response
prediction to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The transposon-based Sleeping Beauty system
presented offers several advantages over lentiviral transduction including the absence
of biosafety issues, faster generation of transgenic cell lines, and greater efficacy in
introducing large gene constructs. Nevertheless, both methods can mediate multiple
insertions in the genome. Here we show that multiple BCR-ABL1 insertions result in
elevated IC50 levels for individual TKIs, thus overestimating the actual resistance of
mutant subclones. We have therefore established flow-sorting-based fractionation of
BCR-ABL1-transformed Ba/F3 cells facilitating efficient enrichment of cells carrying
single-site insertions, as demonstrated by FISH-analysis. Fractions of unselected Ba/
F3 cells not only showed a greater number of BCR-ABL1 hybridization signals, but
also revealed higher IC50 values for the TKIs tested. The data presented highlight
the need to carefully select transfected cells by flow-sorting, and to control the
insertion numbers by FISH and real-time PCR to permit unbiased in vitro testing of
drug resistance.

leukemias involving deregulated tyrosine kinases [6, 7].
In CML, most patients show good long-term responses to
TKIs, but a considerable fraction eventually fail treatment
and experience disease progression [8-11]. Clinical TKIresistance is most frequently associated with mutations
in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) of the BCR-ABL1
fusion gene [12, 13]. The most commonly used model for
in vitro sensitivity testing of novel TKIs and the prediction
of resistance of emerging BCR-ABL1 mutants [14-19] is
the murine interleukin (IL)-3 dependent Ba/F3 cell line,
which can be rendered IL-3 independent by lentiviral (LV)
transduction with the BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase [20].
This system has also been widely used as a model for the

INTRODUCTION
The Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome and the
corresponding fusion gene BCR-ABL1 are the genetic
hallmarks of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Phpositive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) [1].
The BCR-ABL1 fusion gene [2], the alleged driver of
the malignant phenotype in these leukemias, is known to
activate several lines of downstream signaling including
the MAP kinase, mTOR, JAK-STAT, and JAK-MYC
pathways [3]. The introduction of imatinib and other TKIs
has revolutionized the therapy of Ph+ neoplasia [4, 5], and
shows great promise in the treatment of BCR-ABL1-like

discovery and characterization of other oncogenic tyrosine
kinases [21]. Nevertheless, LV-mediated introduction of
oncogenic kinases into Ba/F3 cells has several relevant
limitations and drawbacks. The transformation efficiency
by LV transduction is rather low for large constructs due to
the approximately 100-fold decreased success rate of RNA
encapsidation into infectious particles for inserts over 6 kb
in length [22], thus requiring laborious selection steps for
the generation of transduced cell lines [23]. This problem
also applies to full-length BCR-ABL1 constructs which
span over 5.8 kb. Moreover, lentiviruses tend to insert
within transcriptionally active sites, thereby increasing
the risk of mutagenesis and altered gene expression
[24-27]. Insertion of multiple copies of the construct
within the genome, which is commonly mediated by LV
transduction [25], can also result in elevated expression
levels of the transduced gene. Additionally, cells carrying
more than one copy of a gene construct with oncogenic
properties may have a growth advantage in culture, thus
possibly affecting the readout of ensuing analyses. The
observation of rather variable inhibitory concentration
(IC50) values for individual TKIs reported for the same
mutation in the BCR-ABL1 TKD might be attributable
to this phenomenon [19, 28, 29]. Finally, the procedure
of LV transduction can be very time consuming, and
is associated with relevant biosafety issues. Based on
these considerations, the Sleeping Beauty (SB) system, a
synthetic DNA transposon designed to introduce defined
DNA sequences into the chromosomes of vertebrate
animals and humans, provides an attractive alternative for
genetic transformation and insertional mutagenesis (Figure
1). The SB transposase targets TA-rich sites, preferentially
the palindromic dinucleotide repeat ATATATATAT, in
which the central TA is the canonical target site. In contrast
to lentiviruses, there is no preference for coding or noncoding regions [30]. The SB system is a fast, simple and
safe procedure for stable gene transfer facilitating efficient
transfection even of large constructs [31-34]. However,
similar to LV transduction, the SB system is also prone
to generating multiple insertions in the genome which
may be favored during the selection of engineered cells
in culture [30, 35].
We have employed the SB system to establish Ba/
F3 cell lines stably transfected with fluorescent proteins
and BCR-ABL1 constructs containing either wildtype
(BCR-ABL1WT) or various mutants including G250E
(BCR-ABL1G250E), E255V (BCR-ABL1E255V), T315I (BCRABL1T315I), F317L (BCR-ABL1F317L), and F359V (BCRABL1F359V). Lentivirally transduced Ba/F3 cell lines
bearing the same BCR-ABL1 mutant constructs were
tested for comparison. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) with gating for low fluorescence was implemented
to select cells displaying single gene construct insertions
and homogenous transgene expression, and the efficacy of
specific cell enrichment was documented by fluorescence
in situ hybridization (FISH). The approach presented is

RESULTS
Documentation of BCR-ABL1 construct
insertions by flow sorting and FISH analysis
Ba/F3 cells carrying BCR-ABL1WT, BCR-ABL1G250E,
BCR-ABL1E255V, BCR-ABL1T315I, BCR-ABL1F317L/V or
BCR-ABL1F359V constructs were generated either by
SB- or by LV-mediated gene transfer. After selection
of successfully transformed cells using a fluorescence
protein marker and IL-3 depletion, cells were either
sorted for low fluorescence, as displayed in Figure 2A
and Supplementary Figure S1, or remained unsorted.
Both flow-sorted and unselected cell fractions were
subjected to FISH analysis in order to assess the number
of construct insertions in the genome. While 92-97%
of cells obtained by low fluorescence-based flowsorting showed single hybridization signals (Figure 2B,
Supplementary Table S2), up to 67% of cells from the
unselected fraction displayed two or more signals (Figure
2A, Supplementary Table S2). Flow cytometry-based
analysis of the transformed cells displayed different types
of fluorescence distribution (Figure 3). All LV-transduced
Ba/F3 cells displayed a double peak, as presented in
Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure S1, whereas SBmediated transfection yielded three different types of
peaks prior to selection. The analysis of unselected
cells by FISH showed that the peak shape reflects the
proportion of cells with multiple gene construct insertions
(Supplementary Table S2). A double peak indicating a
very high percentage of cells carrying an elevated number
of insertions was observed in unselected Ba/F3 cells with
BCR-ABL1WT (Figure 3A). A broad peak resulting from a
lower but still relevant number of cells with more than one
insertion was detected in Ba/F3 cells with BCR-ABL1T315I
and BCR-ABL1F317L (Figure 3B). Finally, unselected Ba/
F3 cells with BCR-ABL1G250E, BCR-ABL1E255V and BCRABL1F359V revealed a slender peak revealing the presence
of single construct insertions in the vast majority of cells
(Figure 3C), indicating that further selection by flowsorting for downstream analyses may not be required.

DNA isolated from cells before flow-sorting. While most
flow-sorted cells displayed a single copy of BCR-ABL1
inserts per diploid genome, unselected cells revealed
a significantly higher average number of BCR-ABL1
insertions (Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure S2A).
Real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that flow-sorted
cells carrying single insertions of the construct provide

uniform mRNA expression levels in all transfected
cell lines tested (Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure
S2B). Moreover, BCR-ABL1 expression in these
cells corresponded to the levels detectable in clinical
specimens of patients in chronic phase of CML, based
on the experience of our European LeukemiaNet (ELN)certified reference laboratory. By contrast, unselected

lowest measurements published previously [19, 36]
while unselected cells displaying broad or double peaks
at flow-cytometric analysis showed considerably higher
values often indicating resistance to the TKI tested. In
unselected BCR-ABL1T315I LV-transduced Ba/F3 cells
which displayed multiple insertions of the construct, as
documented by FISH analysis (Supplementary Table S2),
the IC50 determined was 35 nM (Supplementary Table S2),
a value considerably higher than reported previously, and
exceeding the effective plasma concentration of ponatinib
achievable in the clinical setting with 45 mg per day [28].
Similar observations were also made in unselected Ba/F3
cells carrying other BCR-ABL1 constructs and displaying
broad or double peaks in FACS histograms, where the
IC50 values correlated with the predominant number of
insertions (Table 1) and (Supplementary Table S3).

on TKI responsiveness in vitro
Both unselected and flow-sorted Ba/F3 cells with
wildtype or mutant BCR-ABL1 constructs introduced
either by SB-assisted transfection or LV-mediated
transduction were subjected to in vitro survival assays
with increasing concentrations of nilotinib, dasatinib,
and ponatinib. The IC50 values obtained are displayed
in Table 1 and Supplementary Table S3. Cells isolated
by flow-sorting according to low fluorescence levels
(Figure 2A) revealed IC50 values corresponding to the

cells with BCR-ABL1T315I (Figure 6A) and BCR-ABL1F317L
(Figure 6B) constructs previously shown by FISH analysis
to represent a mixture of populations with one, two and
more insertions were investigated. The cells were grown in
culture under standard conditions to study their proliferative
behavior. After four weeks in culture, the cells were
subjected to FACS analysis and the histograms revealed a
major shift towards higher fluorescence levels. Subsequent
assessment by FISH analysis showed multiple hybridization
signals in virtually all cells analyzed (Supplementary Table
S4) indicating the proliferative advantage of cells with
several insertions of BCR-ABL1 constructs.

Western blot analysis was performed to compare
the impact of single and multiple BCR- ABL1 constructs
in Ba/F3 cells on the ABL1 kinase activity and its
downstream signaling by assessing phosphorylation
of the target proteins Crkl, Gab2, and Akt [37, 38].
In comparison to flow-sorted cells displaying lowfluorescence (Figure 5, lanes 3, 9, and 11), unselected
cells (Figure 5, lanes 2, 8, and 10) revealed elevated
phosphorylation levels of the downstream proteins tested,
unless the peaks of flow-cytometric analysis were slender
(Figure 5, lanes 4, 5, 6, 7, 12, and 13). The unselected
LV-transduced cells, all displaying a double peak,
likewise reveal higher phosphorylation of the important
downstream proteins in comparison to the flow-sorted
cells (Supplementary Figure S3). The data indicate
that the presence of two or more BCR-ABL1 construct
insertions in a high proportion of the cells investigated
correlates with increased kinase activity.

DISCUSSION
The importance of point mutations in the TKD of the
BCR-ABL1 fusion gene as a mechanism of TKI resistance
has rendered in vitro sensitivity testing of emerging BCRABL1 mutants a highly relevant diagnostic technique
supporting clinical decisions [14-19, 29, 39]. The most
commonly used approach to TKI sensitivity testing
is based on exploitation of the murine Ba/F3 cell line
carrying mutant BCR-ABL1 constructs introduced by LV78088

step is highly recommended for all cell preparations
displaying broad or double peaks in flow-cytometry
histograms to permit unbiased in vitro testing of drug
resistance. The clinical relevance of our observations
has far reaching consequences beyond Ph+ neoplasia.
The rapidly increasing number of reports on BCR-ABL1like leukemias involving a variety of activated kinases
highlights the relevance of TKI-based treatment and in
vitro prediction of sensitivity to these agents [6, 7, 44].
Appropriate modeling of activated and/or mutant kinases
inserted at single sites into Ba/F3 cells, as presented in this
report, is therefore of paramount importance for reliable
prediction of treatment responses to kinase inhibitors in
vitro, and opens improved possibilities for patient care
in the growing field of precision medicine and targeted
treatments.

mediated transduction [20]. Here we present an alternative
technique, the transposon-based SB system, which offers
advantages with regard to efficacy, speed, and safety [3234, 40]. Nevertheless, we have demonstrated that both
technical approaches can lead to multiple insertions of
BCR-ABL1 gene constructs which result in artificially
elevated IC50 values for the TKIs tested. Reports indicating
variable IC50 values for different TKIs tested against
individual BCR-ABL1 mutants might be attributable to this
phenomenon. This is exemplified by published IC50 values
for ponatinib against the P-loop mutation E255V including
16 nM [28], 33 nM [29], and even 56 nM [19]. The latter
two values are beyond the achievable effective plasma
concentration of the drug [28], and therefore indicate
resistance. Such observations including the data presented
underline the importance of generating Ba/F3 cells with
single insertions of mutant BCR-ABL1 constructs to
provide a basis for adequate in vitro sensitivity testing
of TKIs. Here we demonstrate that this goal is readily
achievable by flow-sorting of SB-transfected Ba/F3
cells with gating for cell fractions with defined low
fluorescence levels. The flow-sorting step does not seem
to be required if the flow-cytometry histograms reveal a
narrow peak indicating great predominance of cells with
single insertions of the respective construct. While narrow
peaks were observed in half of the cell preparations using
the SB-transfection system, they did not occur in any of
the preparations based on LV-transduction. Unselected
preparations displaying broad or double peaks in flowcytometry histograms were shown to contain relevant
proportions of Ba/F3 cells with multiple BCR-ABL1
construct insertions which resulted in artificially increased
IC50 values for the TKIs tested. Moreover, the expansion
of unselected BCR-ABL1-transformed Ba/F3 cells in
culture was shown to favor proliferation and outgrowth
of cells with multiple insertions, thereby preventing
adequate in vitro sensitivity testing. The observation of
greatly elevated IC50 values in these instances is in line
with reports on amplification of the BCR-ABL1 fusion
gene as a relevant mechanism of resistance to kinase
inhibitors [41-43]. Our data also revealed that multiple
insertions correlate with enhanced kinase activity of
BCR-ABL1 resulting in increased phosphorylation of
the adaptor proteins Crkl and Gab2, which are prominent
downstream targets implicated in leukemogenesis of Ph+
neoplasia [38]. Moreover, the mTOR signaling pathway
was also upregulated in unselected cells, as demonstrated
by elevated levels of phosphorylated Akt.
The generation of multiple gene construct insertions
in Ba/F3 cells by LV- or transposon-mediated transfer has
not been reported previously as a relevant problem in
the context of in vitro drug sensitivity testing. Our data
demonstrate that targeted flow-sorting of low-fluorescent
BCR-ABL1-transformed Ba/F3 cells facilitates enrichment
of virtually pure cell fractions carrying single insertions
of the gene construct. Employment of this selection

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cloning of BCR-ABL1 into pITR-ETP SB vector
The full-length coding sequence of BCR-ABL1
was amplified from cDNA of the K-562 cell line using
the primers BCR_pITR_FW and ABL_pITR_RV
(Supplementary Table S1) and cloned into SfiI-linearized
pITR-ETP vector containing genes for puromycin
resistance and the fluorescent protein tdTomato [33,
34, 40] using the In-Fusion Kit (Clontech Laboratories,
Mountain View, CA, USA). The resulting plasmid
pITR-ETP-BCR-ABL1WT was subjected to site-directed
mutagenesis using the complementary primer pairs
G250E_s/G250E_as. E255V_s/E255V_as, T315I_s/
T315I_as, and F317L_s/ F317_as (Supplementary Table
S1) by implementing the QuikChange II XL Kit (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations. Following targeted
mutagenesis, the 4kb fragments including the BCRABL1 TKD sequence between the SalI and SgrAI sites
on each plasmid were sequenced and subcloned back into
the pITR-ETP-BCR-ABL1WT template to ensure that no
passenger mutations have been introduced.

Generation of BCR-ABL1-expressing Ba/F3 cells
and selection by flow-sorting
The murine cell line Ba/F3 was obtained from
DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany, June, 2015) where the
cells are authenticated using PCR-based methods. Ba/
F3 were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) containing
10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific),
1% penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
and supplemented with 2 ng/ml murine IL-3 (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Cells were seeded at 3 x
105 cells/ml and kept at a density below 1.5 x 106 cells/
ml. Nucleofection of pITR-ETP-BCR-ABL1 plasmids

and transposase-encoding vector pcGlobin100x, using
4 µg and 1 µg, respectively, was performed using Cell
Line Nucleofector® Kit V (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Puromycin
(Sigma-Aldrich) was added at 1 µg/ml to the medium 24
h after transfection, followed by selection for 2-5 days.
All cells positive for the fluorescent protein tdTomato
were isolated by flow-sorting using the FACSAriaFusion
instrument (BD Bioscience,Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA)
and grown in IL-3-containing medium to a density of
0.8-1 x 106 cells /ml. IL-3-independent growth was
assessed by washing the cells three times with IL-3-free
medium followed by expansion in IL-3-free medium to
0.8-1 x 106/ml. Finally, the cells were either left unsorted
or enriched according to a defined low-fluorescence
range (Figure 2A), and used for further experiments
immediately after recovery. Fluorescence of sorted
cells was controlled one week after sorting to assess the
homogeneity of the cell population. For the unsorted
BCR-ABL1 mutant cells displaying T315I or F317L, the
changes in fluorescence were measured after one month
in culture. LV-transduced Ba/F3 cells [45] employed for
control purposes were maintained in IL3-free medium
and tested in parallel with SB-transfected cells in different
experiments.

wildtype and mutant cells, smoothed dose-response curves
were fitted using OriginPro 6.1 software (OriginLab,
Northampton, MA, USA). The IC50 values were calculated
by determining the mean of three independent experiments
each performed in quadruplicates.

Immunoblotting
A total of 15x106 Ba/F3 cells SB-transfected or LVtransduced with BCR-ABL1 were lysed using high-salt
buffer (20 mM Tris*HCl, 400 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40,
0.3% Triton X100) with Halt protease and phosphatase
inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The protein
content was assessed using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit
II (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). After denaturing the
samples in NuPAGE® LDS Sample Buffer (Thermo Fisher
Scientific), proteins were separated by electrophoresis
using NuPAGE® 4-12% Bis-Tris Protein Gels (Thermo
Fisher Scientific), transferred onto PVDF membranes
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the XCell IITM Blot
Module (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and treated with
Odyssey Blocking Buffer TBS (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE,
USA). Antibodies directed against the following targets
were used to probe the membranes: phospho-Akt (Ser473),
phospho-Gab2 (Tyr452), phospho-Crkl (Tyr207), Akt,
Gab2, Crkl (all from Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers,
MA, USA) and GAPDH (Abcam, Cambridge, UK).
The DyLightTM conjugated antibodies (Cell Signaling
Technology) were used for visualization of specific bands.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization
The analysis by FISH was performed essentially as
described [46]. Briefly, a digoxigenin-12-dUTP labelled
pITR-ETP-BCR-ABL1 plasmid was used as hybridization
probe to determine the number of BCR-ABL1 construct
insertions in the genome. Sheep antidigoxigeninfluorescein isothiocyanate 1:100 (Roche Diagnostics,
Basel, Switzerland) was used for immunodetection of
hybridized probes. Signals were analyzed using a ZEISS
Imager M2 fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena,
Germany) and the Genesis software (Applied Spectral
Imaging, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

Quantitative real-time PCR analysis
Genomic DNA was isolated using the DNeasy Blood
and Tissue Kit (QIAGEN). Total RNA was isolated with
the help of RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN) and reversetranscribed by employing the High Capacity cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The number of
BCR-ABL1 double- or single-stranded DNA molecules
was quantified on the Taqman 7500 Real Time PCR
System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the primer probe
set Hs03024784_ft (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Taqman
mouse copy number reference assays Trfc and Tert
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used for normalization of
the number of BCR-ABL1 inserts into the murine genome.
The primer/probe set Mm01197698_m1 recognizing
murine Gusb transcripts was used for normalization of the
number of BCR-ABL1 transcripts. All experiments were
done twice in triplicates. The standard curves were built
using the plasmids pITR-ETP-BCR-ABL1WT, pCMV6Gusb (Origene) and mouse genomic DNA (Promega).
Relative expression levels and copy number variations
were calculated according to the ΔΔCt method.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitor sensitivity assays
The TKIs nilotinib, dasatinib and ponatinib (all from
Selleckchem, Houston, TX, USA) were obtained as 10
mM stocks in DMSO. Imatinib was not included because
of its restricted efficacy in the presence of mutations.
Serial TKI dilutions were prepared in phenol red-free
RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and
1% penicillin-streptomycin, (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
for subsequent in vitro sensitivity assays. BCR-ABL1expressing Ba/F3 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at
3 x 105 cells/ml and incubated with the respective TKI
for 72 h at 37°C/5% CO2. Survival was assessed using
the Vybrant® MTT Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) according to a protocol provided by the
manufacturer. To estimate the IC50 of individual drugs for
