Abstract
Different kinases are expressed in different clinical subsets of breast cancer. In this study, we assessed kinase
expression patterns in different clinical subtypes of breast cancer, evaluated the prognostic and predictive values of
kinase metagenes, and investigated their functions in vitro. Four hundred twenty-eight protein kinases in gene
expression data were examined from 684 cases of breast cancer and 51 breast cancer cell lines to identify kinase
expression patterns. We tested the prognostic value of kinase metagenes in 684 node-negative patients who
received no adjuvant therapy and the predictive value in 233 patients who received uniform neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Twelve kinases were overexpressed in estrogen receptor (ER)–positive/human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 (HER2)–negative, 7 in HER2+, and 28 in ER−/HER2− cancers, respectively. We examined the functional
role of 22 kinases overexpressed in ER−/HER2− cancers using siRNA. Downregulation of these kinases caused significant subtype-specific inhibition of cell growth in vitro. Two robust kinase clusters, including an immune kinase
cluster and a mitosis kinase cluster, were present in all clinical subgroups. High mitosis kinase score was associated
with worse prognosis but higher pathologic complete response (pCR) in ER+/HER2− cancers, but not in ER−/HER2−
or HER2+ cancers, in univariate and multivariate analyses including other genomic predictors (MammaPrint,
genomic grade index, and the 76-gene signature). Conversely, higher immune kinase score was associated with
better survival in ER+/HER2− and HER2+ tumors and also predicted higher probability of pCR in HER2+ cancers.
Taken together, our results indicate that kinases regulating mitosis and immune functions convey distinct prognostic information that varies by clinical subtype. Cancer Res; 70(21); 8852–62. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Protein kinases are key regulatory proteins and also provide
attractive targets for drug discovery (1). The complete sequencing of the human genome allowed the identification of
a full repertoire of human protein kinases (2). We hypothesized that different clinical subtypes of breast cancers may
have distinct kinase expression patterns, and kinases themselves may form coexpression clusters that represent biologically important functions. These kinase clusters, or
metagenes, could have prognostic and predictive value and

may represent breast cancer subtype–specific targets (3).
The goal of this study was to identify kinases that are differentially expressed in the three clinically most important subtypes of breast cancers defined by estrogen receptor (ER)
and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)
expression. We assessed the consistency of kinase expression
patterns across multiple different human data sets and in
breast cancer cell lines. We examined the prognostic and chemotherapy response predictive values of kinase metagenes
(i.e., consistently coexpressed kinases) in patient cohorts that
did not receive any systemic therapy and in patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, respectively. Because kinases represent readily druggable therapeutic targets, we
also studied the functional consequences of downregulating
the expression of 22 different kinases using siRNA in a panel
of 15 breast cancer cell lines. For these functional experiments,
we selected kinases that were overexpressed in ER-negative
cancers and were not previously systematically studied in
the context of breast cancer.

Materials and Methods
Microarray data sets

Center/Microarray Quality Control Consortium (n = 233, Gene
Expression Omnibus accession no. GSE16716) and Miller and

colleagues (n = 251, GSE3494; ref. 4) data sets were used as discovery sets to identify differentially expressed genes between
(a) ER-positive/HER2-negative, (b) ER- and HER2-negative,
and (c) HER2-positive (with any ER) tumors, respectively.
These data sets were also used to define kinases that were consistently and highly coexpressed with one another and therefore could be combined into metagenes. To assess the
prognostic value of these metagenes, we studied three other
data sets including Wang and colleagues (n = 286, GSE2034;
ref. 5), TRANSBIG (n = 198, GSE7390; ref. 6), and Mainz (n =
200, GSE11121; ref. 7) corresponding to node-negative breast
cancers that received no systemic adjuvant therapy. We examined the prognostic value separately in each data set to assess
consistency and also in the pooled data set to improve the
power of the analysis. We assessed the chemotherapy response predictive value of the metagenes in the MDACC/
MAQC data set that included patients who received sequential
paclitaxel and 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (T/FAC) preoperative chemotherapy. The clinical characteristics of the patients included in the various data sets
used in this study are presented in Supplementary Table S1.
We also studied gene expression data from two breast cancer
cell line cohorts including a 51-cell line public data set
(ArrayExpress accession no. E-TABM-157; ref. 8) and another
15 cell lines from MDACC that were used in the functional
siRNA experiments (http://bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/
pubdata.html; ref. 9).
Normalization of gene expression data and
genomic signatures
All of the gene expression data used in this study were generated with Affymetrix HG-U133A gene chips. To have uniform
normalization across data sets, we used MAS5 normalization
with a median target array intensity of 600, and expression values were transformed to log 2 using the Bioconductor software.
This method was chosen because only normalized data were
available for the Wang and colleagues data set. The cell lines
were scaled to a target array intensity of 1,500. Uniform MAS5
normalization was necessary to compare the newly derived kinase scores with previously reported prognostic predictors (10);
we followed the same methods as described in the original articles or used the annotation provided by the investigators (6,
11, 12). To calculate the genomic grade index (GGI), we followed
the method that does not require knowledge of the histologic
grade of the samples. This method requires robust scaling with
setting of the interquartile range to 1 and of the median to 0
within each data set (13). We used the GGI threshold defined
in the Wang and colleagues data set, and we applied this
threshold to the TRANSBIG and Mainz data sets for uniformity.
Identification of kinase genes and assessment of
hormone receptor and HER2 status
Human protein kinases were identified online (http://kinase.
com/human/kinome; ref. 14). We could map 428 of the 529
known kinases to 783 probe sets on the Affymetrix HG-U133A
chip using Gene ID annotation (http://www.affymetrix.com/
Auth/analysis/downloads/na27/ivt/HG-U133A.na27.annot.csv.
zip, version November 30, 2008). When multiple probe sets

www.aacrjournals.org

targeted the same gene, we retained only the probe set with
the highest average expression value and greatest variance.
When more than one probe set met these criteria (i.e., showed
very similar values), we retained each of these sets and
considered them as separate measurements. This yielded a
final list of 540 probe sets corresponding to the 428 kinases
(Supplementary Table S2). To calculate metagene scores,
each gene was represented by a single probe set that had the
nominally highest variance.
ER and HER2 receptor status was determined based on
mRNA expression levels as described previously (15). However, positivity threshold values had to be recalculated for
this analysis because we used MAS5 normalization that is
different from the dChip normalization used in the original
publication. The cutoff points were established from the
MDACC/MAQC data, and log 2 normalized values >10.18
of the probe set “205225_at” were considered as ER positive and values >12.54 for the probe set “216836_s_at” were
considered as HER2 positive. Progesterone receptor (PGR)
and Ki67 expression were measured by probe sets
“208305_at” and “212022_s_at,” respectively, and were used
as continuous variables in univariate and multivariate
analyses.
Functional evaluation of kinases as potential
therapeutic targets by siRNA screen
We selected 22 kinases for functional evaluation that
were all overexpressed in ER-negative and HER2-negative
breast cancers and have not been systematically studied
previously. Each gene was targeted with four distinct
siRNAs obtained from Dharmacon, Inc., which were applied
to 15 different breast cancer cell lines (9 ER/HER2 negative
and 6 receptor positive). Twelve cell lines were obtained directly from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)
within 2 months of culture before being used in this study.
All the cell lines were authenticated. Three cell lines (MDAMB-231, MDA-MB-435, and MDA-MB-468) were obtained
from the ATCC within more than 6 months of culture before
being used in this study. For authentication, we performed
a gene expression profiling for each cell line as described
elsewhere (9). MDA-MB-468 resulted to be a luminal cell line
in this cohort rather than a triple-negative cell line as
described by Neve and colleagues (8). This cell line was
accordingly considered as a probably mislabeled cell line
and considered in the non–triple-negative group in the
current analysis.
We optimized the transfection conditions for each cell line
separately using three different types of negative controls including (a) cells grown in regular OptiMEM medium (Invitrogen, Inc.); (b) cells grown in in the presence of transfection
reagents only; and (c) cells transfected with control siRNA
including five different siGENOME-1, siGENOME-2, siGENOME-3, siGENOME-4 constructs and four different ONTARGETplus si RNA constructs (Dharmacon). Four different
positive controls (40 nmol/L final concentration) were used
to define optimal transfection efficiency conditions, including anti-PLK1 (polo-like kinase 1), anti-KIFF11 (kinesine family member 11), anti-COPB2 (coatomer protein β2), and

siCONTROL TOX constructs. We examined eight different
transfection reagents (DharmaFect-1, -2, -3, and -4; Xtreme
Gene; HiPerect; RNAiMax; and siPORT NeoFX) to find the
most efficient and least toxic for each cell line. Cell viability
was determined 96 hours after transfection using the CellTiter Blue cell viability assay (Promega). The optimal transfection conditions were established separately for each cell line,
defined as the most effective transfection reagent and the
best negative and positive siRNA controls that yielded the
highest Z-factor. The Z-factor was calculated as Z = 1 − (3 ×
SSD/R), where R is the dynamic range of the assay (i.e.,
the absolute difference between mean cell viability for a
given negative control and positive control) and SSD is the
sum of the SDs for the positive and negative controls. The
full siRNA screen was performed for all target genes in three
replicates in 384-well plates using the optimal transfection
conditions. Cells were seeded at a density that yielded
about 70% to 90% confluence in the control wells at 96
hours. Each plate included wells with target siRNAs (40
nmol/L per well in 50 μL of total volume) and negative
and positive siRNA controls; the plates were incubated
at 37°C for 96 hours. Percent cell viability was calculated
as follows: First, the median value of absorbance of wells
that contained medium alone was subtracted from the
absorbance readings of all other wells; next, the absorbance
readings were normalized to the negative control wells
(i.e., cells transfected with noncoding control siRNA) by
dividing the test well values with the median absorbance
obtained from the negative siRNA controls and multiplied
by 100. The average percent viability across the three replicate plates was reported for each siRNA. A cell viability
score of 100 indicates no inhibitory effect compared with
negative control wells, and 0 indicates complete lack of
viable cells. Supplementary Table S3 presents the siRNA
target sequences and Dharmacon product IDs and product
names for each of the 22 kinases that were targeted.
Unequal variance t test was used to assess significant decrease in viability compared with controls.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using the BRB-ArrayTools v 3.7.0 Patch_1 (http://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRB-ArrayTools.html) and the R software (http://www.r-project.org).
All statistical tests were two-sided. Differentially expressed
genes between ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancers
were identified by t test with adjustments for HER2 status.
The multivariate permutation test implemented by this software package to estimate false discovery due to multiple
comparisons is based on a study by Korn and colleagues
(16). This method allows for a probabilistic control of the
false discovery proportion by allowing setting the maximum
acceptable percent false-positive findings (e.g., 10%) at a predefined confidence interval (e.g., 90%) for a given set of n
genes. To control for the potentially confounding effects of
HER2 and ER status during ANOVA, these were used as
blocking variables. We used the randomized block design implemented in BRB-ArrayTools that fits two linear models to
the expression data for each gene. The full model included
the ER class variable and the block variable (i.e., HER2), and
the reduced model included only the block variable. The likelihood ratio statistics was used to test the significance of the
difference between the classes (i.e., ER− versus ER+). A similar
analysis was performed for HER2-positive and HER2-negative
cases when ER status was used as a blocking variable.
We defined kinase metagenes based on coexpression. To
be included in a metagene group, a gene had to show a minimum Pearson correlation coefficient of ≥0.4 with the other
members of the gene cluster. This was based on the empirical assessment of between-gene correlations in data sets and
represents a value that defines genes that frequently cluster
together using hierarchical clustering methods. A metagene
also had to contain a minimum of 15 genes in a given data
set to avoid defining a large number of small unstable gene
groups. For the final metagenes that were tested for prognostic or predictive values, we included only those probe sets that
were consistently present in a given kinase coexpression
cluster in both discovery data sets (MDACC/MAQC and Miller

and colleagues). The metagene score was defined as the arithmetic mean of the log 2 expression values of all gene members.
For survival analysis, we used the R-Design package
(http://www.r-project.org). Distant metastasis-free survival
was the primary end point that was available in all data sets,
and it was defined as the time from the diagnosis to distant
metastasis. To make the results comparable across data sets,
survival was right censored at 10 years. To avoid the “optimal
cutoff selection bias” (17), univariate and multivariate Cox
regression analyses were carried out by using metagene
scores as continuous variables in various clinical subgroups.
During analysis of the pooled data sets, sample source was
considered as a stratification variable. The likelihood ratio
test was used to compare multivariate models with or without metagene scores of interest. Patients with missing variables were excluded in the multivariate analysis. To plot
Kaplan-Meier survival curves, three metagene score categories were defined corresponding to low-, intermediate-, and
high-score groups, which were compared by the log-rank
test. We also tested if our metagene scores could further
risk-stratify high-risk ER-positive patients defined by other
previously reported genomic signatures. For plotting purposes, we defined the lowest 30% and the highest 25% percent
values as low and high categories. These distributions were
defined in the Wang and colleagues data set and corresponded
to scores of 7.737 and 8.54, respectively, for the mitotic kinome
metagene score (MKS). The same cutoffs were used in the other two prognostic data sets to plot survival curves.
Univariate linear logistic regression was used to evaluate
the likelihood of pathologic complete response (pCR) according to kinase metagene scores. To avoid overfitting of the
data due to the small number of events in each molecular
subgroup, a multivariate logistic regression analysis was
performed including only the variables that showed a P value
of ≤0.3 in the univariate analysis.

Results
Differentially expressed kinases between different
breast cancer clinical subtypes
In the two separate discovery data sets (Miller and
colleagues and MDACC/MAQC), 118 and 154 probe sets
were differentially expressed between ER-positive and ERnegative tumors after adjustment for HER2 status with a
false discovery proportion ≤1% (Supplementary Table S4).
Fewer probe sets, 31 and 14, were differentially expressed
between HER2-positive and HER2-negative tumors. To define the most robust and consistent differentially expressed
kinases, we introduced two further filters and removed
genes that had a P value of >0.01 or had a ratio of <1.5
of the geometric mean expression between the two classes
of comparison; these criteria had to be met in both data
sets. This left 16 genes defined as consistently overexpressed in ER+, 24 in ER−, 7 in HER2+, and 1 in HER2−
cancers in the two discovery data sets. These same genes
were tested for significant differential expression in the remaining three human data sets and in the 51-cell line data
set (i.e., validation cohorts). The results are presented in

Table 1. Supplementary Fig. S1 shows the distribution of
expression values for each individual genes in the four receptor subsets in each data set. The kinases overexpressed
in ER-positive cancers included several growth factor
receptors (ERBB3, ERBB4, FGFR3, IGFR1, and BMPR1B)
and kinases overexpressed in ER-negative tumors including
mostly intracellular kinases that regulate cell proliferation
(AURKA, AURKB, CDC2, TTK, PLK1, NEK2, BUB1, MELK,
IRAK1, and LYN). Among the HER2-associated kinases, only
CRKRS is located on chromosome 17 within the ERBB2
amplicon. Supplementary Tables S5 and S6 provide further
results of various group-wise comparisons.
Kinase metagenes are predictive of prognosis and
response to chemotherapy
We observed only two distinct groups of kinases that were
strongly and consistently coexpressed in the two discovery
data sets (Supplementary Table S7). One cluster included
12 kinases involved in mitosis, spindle checkpoint, and
G2-M transition; therefore, we refer to these as the mitosis
kinase metagene cluster (MKS). The second cluster included
15 kinases involved in the regulation of immune cells
(Supplementary Table S8); this is referred to as the immune
kinase metagene cluster (IKS).
We assessed the prognostic value of these two metagenes in node-negative patients who received no systemic
adjuvant therapy and were also not included in the definition of these metagenes. We examined the prognostic value separately in the three main clinical subsets of cancers.
The mitosis kinase score (MKS) was not prognostic in
ER-negative/HER2-negative or in HER2-positive cancers.
However, it showed strong and statistically significant association with worse survival in ER-positive/HER2-negative
cancers in each of the three data sets (Table 2). In pooled
analysis, the hazard ratio (HR) was 3.04 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 2.26–4.11; P = 3.00E−13] for a 1-unit increase
of this score. In Cox multivariate analyses performed separately in all three prognostic cohorts including Ki67, PGR
expression, age, and the Nottingham Prognostic Index, all
considered as continuous variables, the MKS remained significant (Table 3).
To plot Kaplan-Maier survival curves, we defined
two cutoff points in the Wang and colleagues data set
corresponding to the top 30% and bottom 25% scores and
applied these to the Mainz and TRANSBIG data sets. Results for the individuals data sets and for the pooled data
are shown in Fig. 1. In the pooled analysis, the 10-year distant metastasis-free survival rates for high, intermediate,
and low MKS were 0.88 (95% CI, 0.83–0.93), 0.74 (95% CI,
0.68–0.82), and 0.45 (95% CI, 0.36–0.57), respectively (logrank test P < 1.00E−10). We also tested if the MKS can further risk-stratify patients who are assigned to the high-risk
category by other prognostic scores. The MKS was able to
identify a low-risk group based on low or intermediate MKS
among the patients who were considered high risk by the
70-gene MammaPrint, the GGI, or the 76-gene Veridex signature (Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. S2). We also performed a
Cox multivariate analysis using the MKS as a continuous

the HR was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.38–0.79; P = 0.001) in the ER+/
HER2− subgroup and 0.33 (95% CI, 0.17–0.65; P = 0.001) in
HER2+ tumors (Table 2). In the Cox multivariate analysis,
the IKS remained statistically significant in two of three

pCR in ER-positive/HER2-negative cancers with an odds
ratio (OR) of 2.6 (95% CI, 1.12–7.09, P = 0.04; Supplementary Table S10). The MKS was not associated with pCR
in any of the other clinical subsets. In the univariate and
multivariate analyses, higher IKS was also significantly

Functional evaluation of 22 kinases overexpressed in
ER-negative/HER2-negative breast cancers
We assessed the functional relevance of 22 kinases overexpressed in ER- and HER2-negative cancers using an
siRNA screen including 15 different breast cancer cell lines.
Figure 3B shows the expression of the 22 genes in each of
the cell lines and the effect of the siRNAs on cell viability.
The expression levels of these genes were generally high in
triple-negative cell lines compared with the average expression
of all genes (Supplementary Fig. S3), and the expression values
tended to be higher in triple-negative breast cancer cell lines
compared with others (Supplementary Table S11), suggesting
that these cell lines may be appropriate models to study the

functional importance of these genes. Downregulation of the
expression of these genes with siRNA resulted in an overall
greater degree of growth inhibition in ER- and HER2negative cells compared with receptor-positive cell lines over
a broad range of cell viability values. Supplementary Table
S11 shows the results for individual genes; 12 genes had
statistically significantly higher (P < 0.05) growth inhibition
in ER- and HER2-negative cell lines compared with receptorpositive cells, and 6 other genes were borderline significant,
with P values between 0.05 and 0.10. The greatest absolute
growth inhibition, a 65% decrease in cell viability, in ER- and
HER2-negative cells was seen with PTK7 (protein tyrosine
kinase 7). The greatest relative growth inhibition compared
with the effects on receptor-positive cells was seen with
EPHB3 (ephrin receptor B3). Supplementary Figs. S4 and S5
show the most significant correlation plots between kinase
mRNA expression and decrease in cell viability after siRNA
knockdown in both triple-negative and non–triple-negative
cell lines.

Discussion
Different clinical subtypes of breast cancers are characterized by different gene expression patterns, distinct DNA copy
number alterations, and differential distribution of various
mutations (18–20). In this study, we examined the expression
distribution of 428 protein kinases in the different clinical subtypes of human breast cancers. Two recent articles suggested
that kinase expression patterns may be different between molecular classes of breast cancer. Finetti and colleagues (21)
identified 16 kinases involved in mitosis that distinguished luminal from basal cancers and could also define prognostic
subgroups within luminal A cancers. Speers and colleagues
(22) reported novel kinase targets for ER-negative cancers
and also found that proliferation-related kinases predict for
poor prognosis.
We focused our comparisons on ER-negative and ERpositive cancers after adjusting for HER2 status and on
HER2-negative and HER2-positive cancers after adjusting

for ER status as a confounder. We selected these receptorbased clinical categories because they reflect the current
clinical approach to breast cancer, and more complex molecular classification methods have not yet been standardized
(23). Molecular class assignment of individual cases with current methods is more variable than classification based on
ER and HER2 (24). We found that 16 protein kinases were
consistently overexpressed in ER-positive tumors across five
different data sets. This suggests that these could provide
some important biological function to sustain the growth
of ER-positive cancers. Several of these kinases were cell surface growth factor receptors (FGFR3, ERBB3, ERBB4, IGF1R,
and BMPR1B) and readily targetable with experimental
drugs. Laboratory research also supports the existence of
cross talk between ER signaling and the various epidermal
and insulin-like growth factor receptor pathways (25–27).
Our data raise the possibility that a combined blockade of
IGFR, FGFR3, and ERBB3 or ERBB4 may enhance endocrine
sensitivity. We also observed high expression of the bone
morphogenetic protein receptor 1B (BMPR1B) in ER-positive
cancer, which is particularly intriguing because these cancers
have a predilection for metastasis to the bone.
We also identified 7 kinases that were preferentially overexpressed in HER2-positive tumors and 24 kinases overexpressed in ER- and HER2-negative breast cancers. To
define potential new therapeutic targets for the latter disease
subset, which currently has no biologically targeted treatments, although poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors
emerged in early clinical trials as promising new drugs

(28), we performed a siRNA screen to target 22 kinases that
were overexpressed in ER- and HER2-negative cancers.
Twelve of these kinases showed higher growth inhibition in
ER- and HER2-negative cell lines compared with receptorpositive cells, suggesting that these kinases could play a role
in the biology of these difficult-to-treat cancers.
We also attempted to identify kinases that are frequently
coexpressed in a consistent manner. Such coexpression clusters could indicate a functional kinase unit or reflect the
presence of a particular cell type that is characterized by
these kinases. Only two robust and consistent clusters were
observed. One of these corresponded to mitosis kinases, and
the other to kinases that are mostly expressed in lymphocytes. These kinase coexpression clusters were present in
all clinical subtypes to variable extents. We evaluated their
prognostic role and found that higher expression of the
mitosis-related kinases (MKS) was strongly and significantly
associated with poor prognosis in ER-positive/HER2-negative
cancers, but not in the other subtypes. This is consistent with
numerous previous reports that indicated a major prognostic
value for proliferation markers in ER-positive cancers (29–
31). However, our MKS remained significant in the multivariate analysis even after adjustment for other proliferation
markers including Ki67 and was able to restratify patients
who were considered high risk by other prognostic gene signatures (the 76-gene signature, the GGI, and the 70-gene
MammaPrint). These results suggest that the prognostic information provided by proliferation may not be optimally

captured by the empirically developed first-generation prognostic signatures. Indeed, the performance of some previously published prognostic signatures even improved after
removing non–proliferation-related genes (31).
The IKS also provided consistent prognostic information
on multiple data sets independent of the MKS. Higher IKS
was associated with better prognosis in ER-positive/HER2negative and HER2-positive tumors (but not in ER- and
HER2-negative cancers). Previous studies that examined
the association between immune cell infiltration of breast
cancer and prognosis yielded contradictory results. Several
recent articles described various immune-related gene signatures that were prognostic in different subsets of breast
cancers and generally supported the hypothesis that the
presence of immune cell heralds better prognosis (7, 32–
34). Which arm of the immune system, humoral immunity
or T-cell– or natural killer cell–mediated effects, if any, is
responsible for the better outcome is yet to be established
and may vary from tumor subtype to subtype or even from
patient to patient.
In one homogeneously treated neoadjuvant patient cohort,
we also examined the association between these kinase
scores and pathologic response to preoperative chemotherapy. Both high MKS and IKS were associated with significantly
higher probability of pCR in ER-positive/HER2-negative and
HER2-positive cancers, respectively, but not in ER/HER2–
negative tumors. The association between higher proliferation rate and better response to preoperative chemotherapy,
particularly in ER-positive cancers, is well known (35). How-

ever, the importance of the immunologic parameters in predicting treatment sensitivity is just emerging. Two recent
reports showed that a CD40 gene signature (corresponding
to B cells) and tumor-associated lymphocyte infiltration were
both predictive of better response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (36, 37).
In summary, these results support the hypothesis that in
addition to the strong prognostic effect of proliferation,
immunologic variables also predict prognosis and chemotherapy response particularly among ER-positive and
HER2-positive cancers. We also described a core set of consistently differentially expressed kinases between various
clinical subtypes of breast cancer. These results provide a
roadmap to systematically explore the therapeutic relevance
of these cancer subtype–specific kinases.
