BACKGROUND: Rituximab combined with chemotherapy has improved the survival of previously untreated patients with follicular
lymphoma (FL). Nevertheless, many patients neither want nor can tolerate chemotherapy, leading to interest in biological
approaches. Epratuzumab is a humanized anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody with efficacy in relapsed FL. Because both rituximab and
epratuzumab have single-agent activity in FL, the antibody combination was evaluated as initial treatment of patients with FL.
METHODS: Fifty-nine untreated patients with FL received epratuzumab 360 mg/m2 with rituximab 375 mg/m2 weekly for 4 induction
doses. This combination was continued as extended induction in weeks 12, 20, 28, and 36. Response assessed by computed tomography was correlated with clinical risk factors, [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography findings at week 3, Fcg polymorphisms, immunohistochemical markers, and statin use. RESULTS: Therapy was well-tolerated, with toxicities similar to expected with
rituximab monotherapy. Fifty-two (88.2%) evaluable patients responded, including 25 complete responses (42.4%) and 27 partial
responses (45.8%). At 3 years follow-up, 60% of patients remain in remission. Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index
(FLIPI) risk strongly predicted progression-free survival (P 5.022). CONCLUSIONS: The high response rate and prolonged time to
progression observed with this antibody combination are comparable to those observed after standard chemoimmunotherapies and

INTRODUCTION
Incorporation of rituximab into chemotherapy regimens for the initial treatment of follicular lymphoma (FL) has
improved response rates, and overall survival.1-3 However, not all patients require or tolerate chemoimmunotherapy, and
there are acute and long-term toxicities. Thus, studies have evaluated noncytotoxic strategies for initial treatment of
patients with FL. Ghielmini et al published a randomized trial in which patients received 4 weekly doses of rituximab
alone or followed by rituximab maintenance every other month for 4 additional doses, demonstrating superior event-free
survival and response duration with extended treatment.4 Using this treatment schedule, the Cancer and Leukemia Group
B (CALGB) Lymphoma Committee conducted a series of phase 2 studies to explore novel biologic combinations with
promising agents in combination with rituximab. Rituximab and galiximab achieved a response rate of 72.1% with
47.6% complete responses (CRs) in untreated patients, including a 92% overall response rate (ORR) with 75% CRs in
patients with a low Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) score.5
Epratuzumab is a humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody directed against the B-cell-specific
antigen, CD22, a 135-kDa transmembrane phosphoglycoprotein found on pre-B and mature, normal, and lymphoma B
cells that acts as a signaling molecule in cellular adhesion, regulation of B-cell homing, and modulation of B-cell activation.6 Although CD22 is internalized into cells following antibody binding, the mechanisms underlying the clinical efficacy of epratuzumab are not entirely clear.7,8 The highest response rates to epratuzumab in phase 1/2 studies were

observed in patients with FL.9 No dose-limiting toxicity
was identified at doses of up to 1000 mg/m2 weekly for 4
consecutive weeks.9 Epratuzumab plus rituximab has
been tested in a 4-times weekly schedule in patients with
relapsed FL, with response rates of 54% to 67% and
remissions lasting 13 to 18 months.7,10 Nevertheless,
responses to monoclonal antibody therapy may take
weeks to months to occur.11,12 Here, we report a phase 2
trial conducted in CALGB that evaluated the combination of epratuzumab with rituximab given with extended
induction in the treatment of newly diagnosed FL.

risk according to the FLIPI were to be considered for
another phase 3 trial, but were allowed on this trial.
Study Treatment

Therapy consisted of rituximab (375 mg/m2 per dose)
and epratuzumab (360 mg/m2 per dose) (provided by
Immunomedics Corp, Morris Plains, NJ). In week 1, rituximab was administered on day 1 and epratuzumab on
day 3 to define specific toxicities. Thereafter, the antibodies were given on the same day, with rituximab administered first, followed by epratuzumab, and infusions
delivered on days 8, 15, and 22, and then on week 12, 20,
28, and 36 for a total of 8 doses over 9 months. Thirty
minutes prior to each rituximab treatment, the patient
received premedication including diphenhydramine and
oral acetaminophen.

Study Objectives

The primary objective of the study was to estimate the
ORR within 12 months of study enrollment. ORR is
defined as achievement of a CR or partial response (PR) as
the best-observed response between trial entry and 12
months from enrollment. The Simon minimax design
used had a 10% type I error rate at an ORR rate of 70%
and 90% power for an ORR of 85%.13 The experimental
therapy was considered sufficiently promising for further
investigation if at least 16 of 22 patients had an ORR
from the first stage and at least 41 patients had an OR
from the cumulative 52 patients after the second stage.
Secondary endpoints included time to progression after
treatment with epratuzumab and rituximab extended
induction therapy, the toxicity profile of the combination,
and the correlation of change in [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose
(FDG) uptake early after treatment with response rate
and time to progression.
Patient Selection

This multi-institution phase 2 trial enrolled 60 patients
from May 2008 to July 2009 by 17 CALGB institutions.
The trial was approved by the institutional review board
at each institution, and all patients gave written consent.
Eligibility criteria included age > 18 years with previously untreated, histologically confirmed FL, grade 1, 2,
or 3a with stage III, IV, or bulky (ie, single mass  7 cm)
stage II disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
performance status of 0 to 2; measureable (eg, tumor mass
> 1.5 cm) disease; no known central nervous system
involvement; and adequate baseline renal and liver function. In addition, the lymphomas were required to be
CD20-positive, but CD22 positivity was not required to
be documented at study entry. Patients classified as high
3798

Assessments

Patients were restaged during weeks 10, 24 (month 6),
and 40 (month 10), every 4 months for 2 years, then every
6 months until disease progression or for a maximum of
10 years from study entry. Responses and progression
were defined according to the revised response criteria for
malignant lymphoma.14 Computed tomography imaging
was used to define response, assessing the sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 nodes defined on
baseline imaging.
Evaluation of interim FDG positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) was exploratory, and the results
were not included in determining response to treatment
for the primary study objective. All baseline and interim
(on days 18 to 22) PET scans followed a standard protocol. No more than a 10-minute difference in the time
from injection to scanning was allowed between baseline
and interim PET scans. FDG-PET images obtained
before treatment were compared to PET scans on days 18
through 22 during epratuzumab 1 rituximab therapy by
a central reviewer blinded to clinical information, using
visual assessment based on International Harmonization
Project criteria.15 A secondary reading was performed
using Deauville criteria with the liver uptake as a cutoff
for defining positive lesions at all disease sites with focal
uptake including the bone marrow and solid organs.16 A
semiquantitative analysis was also performed by determining percent changes in maximum standardized uptake
value (SUVmax) between the baseline and interim PET
scans in up to 12 lesions measuring above 2.0 cm. Receiver operating characteristic curves for SUVmax changes
were created to determine a cutoff to define a positive and
a negative metabolic response.

Pretreatment samples for analyses of V/F 158
FcgRIIIa and FcgRIIa 131 H/R polymorphisms were
available for all patients. DNA was extracted using the
QIAamp kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Qiagen, Valencia, Calif). Assessment of the of FcgRIIIa
and FcgRIIa polymorphisms was performed as
described.17 All samples were analyzed in duplicate, with
identical results.
Tissue microarrays were constructed using duplicate
1-mm cores (Beecher Instruments, Sun Prairie, Wis) and
immunostained using an automated stainer (Benchmark,
Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, Ariz) with antibodies
to CD10 (56C6; Ventana), CD22 (Sp104; Ventana),
CD68 (PGM1; Dako, Carpinteria Calif), BCL6 (PGB6p;
Dako), MUM1 (MUM1p; Dako), FOXP1 (JC12; Abcam,
Cambridge, Mass), FOXP3 (236A/E7; Novus, Littleton,
Colo), BCL2 (124; CellMarque, Rocklin, Calif), PD1
(NAT; Abcam), and Ki67 (30-9; Ventana). Stains (except
Ki67 and CD22) were evaluated independently by 2 experienced hematopathologists blinded to clinical outcome.
Recorded scores were the average of the 2 estimates. In cases
where estimates were > 20% different, a third pathologist
reviewed the stain to resolve the discrepancy and render a
score. CD10 and BCL6 was scored as negative (0% tumor
cells), weak (1%-30% tumor cells), or strong (> 30% tumor cells) and MUM1 was scored positive with a cutoff of
> 20% in tumor cells.18,19 BCL2 was scored positive with
a cutoff of 30% tumor cells.
The architectural pattern of FOXP3-positive T cells
is an independent predictor of survival in patients with
follicular lymphoma, and FOXP3 was evaluated for follicular pattern defined by accentuation of FOXP3-positive
T cells within or around follicles.20 CD68 was scored by
counting the number of positive cells (macrophages) in
intra- and interfollicular cells per high-power field (average of 3 fields).21 FOXP1 in tumor cells was scored in
10% increments. PD1 was scored in follicles as 0 (< 2%),
11 (2%-10%); and 31 (> 10%). Nuclear Ki67 staining
was scored by image analysis (ImagePro 5.0; MediCybernetics, Rockville, Md). CD22 expresion in lymphoma
cells was scored to nearest 10% by 1 pathologist (E.D.H.).

had stable disease. One patient (1.7%) completed all
courses of treatment but was inevaluable for response
because of death due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) before the time of response assessment. Accounting for the 2-stage design, the uniformly
minimum variance unbiased estimate22 of the ORR is
88.1%, its 80% confidence interval23 is (80.9%, 93.3%),
and the P value24 is .0009, concluding that the ORR of
the study is significantly higher than 70%
All 25 patients with CR completed all treatment, as
did 25 (92.6%) of 27 patients with PRs. Four of 6 nonresponders completed all therapy, 1 died during induction,
and 1 was taken off due to progression at month 5.
At the time of this analysis, 24 (40.7%) of the 59
patients have reached a study endpoint, including 3 deaths
and 21 lymphoma progressions. Progression has been
observed in 4 of the 25 CRs, 13 of the 30 PRs, and 4 of 6
patients with stable disease.
There have been 5 deaths to date, comprising 1 endocarditis, 1 MRSA septic shock, 1 patient with stable disease
who progressed but died from necrotizing bronchopneumonia, 1 patient who progressed after achieving a PR, and
1 from cardiopulmonary collapse/peritonitis.
The median follow-up time for all patients is 2.8
years (range, 0.3-3.7 years), and 2.7 years (1.1-3.8 years)
for the 35 patients who have neither progressed nor died.
The estimated median PFS is 3.5 (95% confidence interval 5 2.6, 4.4) years, with an estimated probability of PFS
of 0.92 (95% confidence interval 5 0.81, 0.96) at 1 year,

and 0.60 (95% confidence interval 5 0.44, 0.73) at 3
years (Fig. 1). The probability of survival at 3 years is 0.91
(95% confidence interval 5 0.80, 0.96) (Fig. 2).
Correlates of Clinical Outcome

PFS was associated with FLIPI risk (P 5 .022; Fig. 3) and
84% of patients who achieved a CR remained disease-free
at 3 years. Forty-eight percent of PRs remained in remission and 17% with stable disease had neither progressed
nor died by 3 years.
There were 11 of 59 (18.6%) patients with bulky disease as defined as any single nodal mass  7 cm. The CR
rate in the patients with bulky disease was 1 of 11 (9.1%)
compared with 24 of 48 (50.0%) in those without bulky
disease (P 5 .017, Fisher’s exact test) (Fig. 2). Progressionfree survival was worse in those with bulky disease (hazard
ratio 5 2.40, P 5 .044, log-rank test) (Fig. 4).
The median time to CR was 9.2 months with a
range of 2.2 to 24.5 months. Statin use did not impact
response or PFS in contrast to prior reports.25 Neither the
visual evaluation using International Harmonization Project or Deauville criteria nor the percent change in SUVmax between baseline and day 18 through 22 of treatment
predicted CR rate, ORR, or PFS.
Toxicity/Adverse Events/Second Malignancy

The combination of rituximab and epratuzumab was
extremely well-tolerated. Infusional reactions similar to
those commonly observed with rituximab alone occurred,
with urticaria in 2 patients (3%), hypersensitivity (grade
2) in 3 patients (5%), or hypotensive events in 3 patients

(5%). Severe adverse events included 1 myocardial infarction, 2 episodes of severe fatigue (3%), 2 episodes of severe
nausea and diarrhea (3%), 2 reports of severe muscle
weakness (3%), 3 of severe pain (5%), 5 (8%) of moderate
pain, and 1 each (2%) of dyspepsia and emesis.
One patient was taken off treatment due to disease
progression after month 5, another developed line sepsis during week 3 of induction, and died with endocarditis and renal failure 2 months later. Two patients were taken off study
due to adverse events, 1 during induction (grade 4 thrombosis and myocardial infarction) and 1 following month 5
(grade 3 dyspnea, hypoxia, not otherwise specified).
Neutropenic episodes occurred infrequently (3 (5%)
patients with grade 2 and 1 (2%) patient with grade 3),
although moderate fatigue was reported by 10 (17%)
patients. Other adverse events were grade 2 or less and
occurred in less than 3% of patients. Two secondary
malignancies have been reported: 1 kidney cancer diagnosed 18 months after starting therapy and 1 colon cancer
18 months after starting therapy.
Biomarkers

There were no significant associations (P > .05) between
aberrant phenotype (CD10-negative, BCL6-negative,
FOXP1-positive, or MUM1-positive) FL and CR, OR,
or event-free survival (EFS) (Table 2). Likewise, numbers
of CD681 lymphoma-associated macrophages, FOXP3
pattern, number of PD11 T-cell, BCL-2 expression, and
Ki67 proliferative fraction showed no significant associaCancer

tion with these clinical outcome parameters. Finally, Fcg
polymorphism studies and CD22 expression level showed
no correlation with CR, response rate, or EFS (Table 3).
Of note, patients lacking of BCL6 expression appeared to
have a lower response rate (13 of 17, 76.5%) than patients
with BCL6 expression (25 of 27, 92.5%) with a shorter
PFS and hazard ratio of 0.53 for those with BCL6 expression. Although not significant, the trend (P 5 .146) is
worthy of further investigation.
DISCUSSION
Our study confirms that immunotherapy without cytotoxic
therapy can achieve durable remissions in untreated FL.
Martinelli et al26 reported that 45% of responding, previously untreated patients with FL given rituximab singleantibody therapy remained progression-free at 8 years. The
challenge has been to identify which patients will respond
with very durable remissions, and to find agents that will
amplify the activity of rituximab without adding toxicity.
In our study, epratuzumab plus rituximab (E1R)
yielded a response rate of 88.2% and an overall 3-year
PFS of 60%. The lengthy PFS observed in low and intermediate FLIPI patients after treatment with this doublet
compares favorably with those reported for both chemotherapy and non-chemotherapy-based regimens,2,5,26-28
and suggests that epratuzumab extends the efficacy of rituximab in treatment of FL.
The durable remissions observed in this study are at
least comparable to those reported for other FL regimens.
At 3 years, 60% of patients in our cohort remain in remission, compared with 64% for those treated with R3801

Epratuzumab demonstrates both cytotoxic activity against
lymphoma in vitro and immunomodulatory activity6,31,32
with the potential to improve and lengthen responses after
rituximab. Unexpectedly prolonged responses observed in
a subset of patients with relapsed FL treated with R1E in

Whereas the overall estimated 3 year PFS for our

our study was intended for lower risk FL, enrollment
included 48% intermediate and 30% high risk patients.
This patient population reflects the interest of patients
and clinicians in chemotherapy-free treatment approaches
in this setting. Eighty-four percent of patients who
achieved CR remained disease-free at 3 years; 48% of
those who achieved a PR remained in remission, with
16% of those with stable disease not yet progressed.
The response rate observed with this doublet is similar to that described by Ghielmini for previously untreated
patients given rituximab at the same dose and schedule
(90%),4 and that observed by our group for the combination of galiximab plus rituximab delivered in the same
extended induction schedule (72.1%).5 Patient selection
likely influences, in part, the observed response rates.
An important aim of our study was to evaluate
patient and tumor characteristics associated with response
or response duration after epratuzumab and rituximab
therapy. FLIPI clinical characteristics in our patients were
associated with disease-free survival (DFS) after treatment; no other patient characteristics were identified.
Observed responses to R1E were not different across the
FLIPI categories. Early response measured by change in
FDG uptake did not identify those likely to enjoy a long
DFS. With a median follow up of 2.7 years, we were
unable to confirm an association with biomarkers and
response or survival as in other trials,33-38 although it is
possible that with larger patient numbers and longer
follow-up, individual markers might identify such
patients.
There is a paucity of prospective PET data for follicular lymphoma acquired with standardized imaging protocols and interpreted with uniform interpretation criteria.
Moreover, the majority of quantitative PET analyses were
based on retrospective data evaluations.39,40 Most studies
investigating the role of PET posttreatment have demonstrated strong correlations with patient outcome.39-41
There is no firm evidence that FDG-PET plays a
role in interim response evaluation during induction therCancer

apy in patients with FL. This study is the first to assess a
potential predictive role for interim PET scan performed
very early during the course of induction therapy. Our
results did not support the use of an interim PET as a surrogate for response or survival for patients with advanced
stage FL. FDG uptake at 3 weeks after R1E likely reflects
both remaining lymphoma and an inflammatory reaction.
Other studies have failed to show a correlation between
midtreatment PET during chemoimmunotherapy and
patient outcome.40
Rituximab plus epratuzumab was extremely well tolerated, with DFS at 3 years similar to that observed after
treatment with chemoimmunotherapy, confirming that
immunotherapy may have an important role in the initial
treatment of FL, particularly among patients with FLIPI
low-risk disease. Longer follow-up will clarify the durability of responses, the patient and tumor characteristics predictive of extended disease-free survival, and analysis of
long-term toxicities associated with conventional chemoimmunotherapy regimens.
