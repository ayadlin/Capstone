Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Skp2 E3 ligase is overexpressed in numerous human cancers and plays a critical role in cell cycle
progression, senescence, metabolism, cancer progression and metastasis. In the present study, we
identified a specific Skp2 inhibitor using high-throughput in silico screening of large and diverse
chemical libraries. This Skp2 inhibitor selectively suppresses Skp2 E3 ligase activity, but not
activity of other SCF complexes. It also phenocopies the effects observed upon genetic Skp2
deficiency, such as suppressing survival, Akt-mediated glycolysis as well as triggering p53independent cellular senescence. Strikingly, we discovered a critical function of Skp2 in positively
regulating cancer stem cell populations and self-renewal ability through genetic and
pharmacological approaches. Notably, Skp2 inhibitor exhibits potent anti-tumor activities in
multiple animal models and cooperates with chemotherapeutic agents to reduce cancer cell
survival. Our study thus provides pharmacological evidence that Skp2 is a promising target for
restricting cancer stem cell and cancer progression.

and radiotherapy represent two major options for cancer treatment through inducing p53dependent cellular senescence and apoptosis (Vazquez et al., 2008). However, advanced
cancers often develop resistance to these treatments as they often lose their p53 response due
to frequent mutations on the p53 gene. In this scenario, developing cancer treatment
strategies via boosting p53-independent senescence and/or apoptosis responses is a key to
the success of advanced cancer treatments. In addition, targeting aerobic glycolysis has
recently emerged as a promising strategy for cancer therapies (Vander Heiden et al., 2009).
Cancer cells display elevated glycolysis irrespective of the presence or absence of oxygen,
which warrants cancer cell proliferation and survival. Aerobic glycolysis is orchestrated by
Akt, whose activation is achieved by its membrane translocation and subsequent
phosphorylation (Elstrom et al., 2004; Robey and Hay, 2009). As our recent reports
uncovered that distinct E3 ligases are utilized to trigger non-proteolytic K63-linked
ubiquitination of Akt (Chan et al., 2012, Yang et al., 2009), targeting E3 ligase of Akt may
serve as a promising strategy to tame cancer glycolysis.

Skp2 is an F-box protein, constituting one of the four subunits of the Skp1-Cullin-1-F-Box
(SCF) ubiquitin E3 ligase complex. Earlier studies showed that Skp2 regulates apoptosis,
cell cycle progression and proliferation by promoting ubiquitination and degradation of p27
(Nakayama et al., 2004). However, our recent report attributed a critical role of the Skp2
SCF complex in triggering non-proteolytic K63-linked ubiquitination of Akt (Chan et al.,
2012). Overexpression of Skp2 is frequently observed in human cancers and ectopic
expression of Skp2 promotes tumorigenesis in a prostate tumor xenograft model (Hershko,
2008, Lin et al., 2009). Moreover, Skp2 overexpression is found to promote cancer invasion
and metastasis, whereas its deficiency inhibits these processes (Chan et al., 2010a). Using
transgenic mouse models, we and others have illustrated that Skp2 is required for cancer
development in multiple tumor-promoting conditions, and that Skp2 deficiency triggers p53independent, p27-dependent cellular senescence/apoptosis but inhibits Akt-mediated
glycolysis (Chan et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2010). Collectively, these studies
suggest targeting Skp2 is a promising strategy for cancer treatment, thereby calling for an
urgent need to develop specific Skp2 inhibitors.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In this study, we aimed to develop a specific Skp2 small molecule inhibitor and tested its
efficacy on tumor suppression. Using structure-based high-throughput virtual screening
technologies (Zhang, 2011), we have identified 25 compounds that potentially interact with
Skp2 to prevent its binding to Skp1. Further experiments showed that one compound, called
compound #25, indeed binds to Skp2, prevents Skp2-Skp1 interaction and inhibits Skp2
SCF E3 ligase activity, which consequently suppresses survival of cancer cells and cancer
stem cells. More importantly, compound #25 also exhibits potent anti-tumor activity in
animal studies. Our study therefore offers convincing evidence that pharmacological
inactivation of Skp2 is a promising approach for cancer treatment.

Result
Identification of Skp2 small molecule inhibitors using high-throughput in silico screening
approaches
The crystal structure of Skp2-SCF complex (PDB entry code: 2AST) has demonstrated that
Skp2 directly interacts with Skp1 via its F-box domain and indirectly associates with
Cullin-1 and Rbx1 (Schulman et al., 2000; Zheng et al., 2002). Along the large Skp2-Skp1
interaction interface (2,980Å2), some residues contribute more significantly to their binding
than others; these residues are called hot spots. Based on our molecular visualization,
literature reports and hot spot analysis, we found 19 residues on Skp2 in contact with
Skp1.We grouped these critical Skp2-Skp1 contact sites into two pocket-like and distinct
regions (Figure 1A). The first region (referred as pocket 1) is close to the N-terminus of
Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 August 01.

Skp2 and is actually within the F-box motif including Trp97, Phe109, Glu116, Lys119 and
Trp127. The second region (referred as pocket 2), in proximity to the C-terminus of Skp2, is
formed by the first LRR region and some residues from the F-box (Figure 1A). Therefore
inhibitors binding to these two pockets would potentially prevent the Skp2-Skp1 complex
formation.
Based on the above predicted potential binding pockets, we performed high-throughput
virtual screening with our rigorously validated hit identification workflow (Figure S1A)
(Ahad et al., 2011; Yadav et al., 2012). We screened 120,000 diverse and commercially
available chemical compounds using our HiPCDock program (Zhang and Du-Cuny, 2009;
Zhang et al., 2008), and selected 25 hits that were predicted to bind to Skp2 (Figure S1A).
Among them, 16 hits were predicted to interact with pocket 1, nine hits bind to pocket 2 and
two hits dock on both pockets. During the selections of these hits, we considered not only
the predicted binding affinities, but also various other drug-like properties such as solubility
and molecular weight. We propose that by interacting with either (or both) of these two
sites, our hits may block the binding of Skp1 to Skp2 and thereby resulting in deconstruction
of the Skp2 SCF complex (Figure 1A).
Skp2 inhibitors prevent Skp2-Skp1 interactions and Skp2 SCF E3 ligase activity in vitro

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To test our hypothesis generated in silico, we performed in vitro GST-pull down assay to
assess which compounds from our 25 hits can prevent Skp2 and Skp1 interactions. We
found that seven of them demonstrated strong inhibition of Skp2-Skp1 complex formation at
20µM (data not shown). Next, these seven compounds were subjected to in vitro Skp2-Skp1
binding assay at lower concentration (5µM) in order to identify more potent Skp2 inhibitors
(Figure 1B). Strikingly, we revealed that SZL-P1–41 (referred to as compound #25) could
completely prevent Skp2-Skp1 interactions at this concentration (Figure 1B). Consistently,
compound #25 impeded in vivo binding of Skp2 to Skp1 in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 1C). It should be noted that another compound SZL-P1–35 (referred to as compound
#22) also reduced Skp2-Skp1 complex formation, albeit to a lesser extent compared to
compound #25 (Figure 1B). As the interaction between Skp2 and Skp1 is a prerequisite for
the integrity of Skp2 SCF complex and is crucial for executing its E3 ligase activity
(Schulman et al., 2000; Zheng et al., 2002), our data illustrated that the small molecules
identified through in silico approach indeed prevent Skp2-Skp1 association.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The canonical role of the Skp2 SCF complex is primarily to trigger ubiquitination and
degradation of its protein substrates (Chan et al., 2010b; Frescas and Pagano, 2008). Among
all canonical Skp2 substrates, p27 is the most well characterized target whose deficiency can
rescue the phenotypes observed in Skp2−/− mice, indicating that p27 is a physiological
substrate for Skp2 (Nakayama et al., 2004). Since compound #25 displayed the highest
efficacy in preventing Skp2-Skp1 complex formation (Figure 1B), we further determined its
effect on Skp2 SCF E3 ligase activity. In vivo and in vitro p27 ubiquitination assays
revealed that compound #25 inhibited Skp2-mediated p27 ubiquitination (Figures 1D and
1E). Consistent with the p27 ubiquitination assay, we found that treatment with compound
#25 induced endogenous p27 protein expression in prostate cancer cells (Figures 1F and
3E), recapitulating the phenotype upon genetic Skp2 ablation (Carrano et al., 1999).
Likewise, we found that compound #25 also induced expression of p21 (Figures 1F and 3E),
another Skp2 substrate (Bornstein et al., 2003).
Akt is a Skp2 substrate undergoing K63-linked polyubiquitination (Chan et al., 2012).
Consistent with the genetic evidence that Skp2 regulates Akt ubiquitination, compound #25
also inhibited Skp2-mediated Akt ubiquitination in vivo and in vitro (Figures 1G and 1H).
Since Skp2 is required for EGF-mediated Akt phosphorylation and activation by triggering
Akt ubiquitination, we next determined whether our Skp2 inhibitor attenuated the process.

As expected, compound #25 profoundly inhibited EGF-mediated Akt phosphorylation and
activation in various cancer cell lines (Figure 1I and Figures S1B and S1C). However,
administration of compound #25, similar to Skp2 deficiency, displayed no noticeable impact
on ERK activation (Figures S1C and S1D), underscoring the important role of Skp2 in
selectively regulating EGF-mediated Akt signaling. It should be noted that compound #25
not only abrogated Skp2-Skp1 complex formation and Skp2 E3 ligase activity, but also
downregulated Skp2 protein expression at higher dosage (20 µM) (Figures 1C, 1I and 3E
and Figures S1B and S1C). Moreover, we uncovered that compound #25 primarily caused
downregulation of Skp2 at the protein level, not mRNA level, and this reduction was
partially rescued by proteasome inhibitor (Figures S1E and S1F). Collectively, our data
indicate that the pharmacologic Skp2 inhibition stabilizes p27 and p21 expression and
inhibits EGF-mediated Akt activation.
The physical binding of Skp2 inhibitor to Skp2 prevents Skp2-Skp1 complex formation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The chemical structure of #25 disclosed in Figure 2A is characterized by 1H, 13C NMR and
LC-MS/MS analysis (Figure S2). To understand how compound #25 interacts with Skp2 and
prevents Skp2-Skp1 complex formation, we analyzed our molecular docking results. The
benzothiazole substructure of #25 is predicted to interact with residue Trp97, mainly via
aromatic stacking and polar contacts (Figure 2A). Interestingly, it is also close to a
hydrophobic pocket consisting of Trp97, Leu105, Ile108, Phe109 and Trp127 (Figure 2A).
Potentially, interaction with this hydrophobic pocket can increase the binding. The other
critical part of the inhibitor is the chromone moiety, which is extended through the pocket
formed by residues Asp98 and Trp127 and has contacts with these residues via either
hydrogen bonds or hydrophobic/aromatic interactions. Interestingly, the ethyl group on the
phenol ring does not contribute significantly to the inhibitor binding to Skp2; however, it
extends out into the region where Skp1 occupies when it binds to Skp2. Therefore this
moiety is critical for preventing Skp1-Skp2 interactions, and removal of this ethyl group
indeed abolished activity, in agreement with our structure-activity relationship studies (see
SAR analysis section below). Additionally, the piperidine group of #25 is critical for the
inhibitor binding as it interacts closely with Asp98 and Trp127.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We found that our pocket 2 inhibitors (such as inhibitor #5) have very different core
scaffolds. They bind to pocket 2 mainly via interactions with Trp128, Ser132, Trp137,
Gln158, and the large leucine-rich hydrophobic pocket formed by the first and second LRRs.
The potent Skp2 inhibitor (inhibitor #25 in Figure 1B) was predicted to bind to pocket 1, but
not pocket 2, indicating that the pocket 1 within the F-box motif is probably more critical to
the Skp2-Skp1 interaction. This notion is in agreement with previous reports underscoring
the importance of F-box motif in Skp2 SCF complex formation as well as Skp2 E3 ligase
activity (Kim et al., 2003; von der Lehr et al., 2003). Based on our modeling predictions,
residues Trp97, Asp98, Arg126 and Trp127 from Skp2 directly interact with compound #25
(Figure 2A). While Pro101, Leu105, Ile108 and Phe109 residues are involved in Skp1
binding, but not significantly contributing to the binding of #25. We next performed sitedirected mutagenesis to mutate these residues to alanine (Ala) and determined which
residues of Skp2 are critical for Skp2-Skp1 binding and Skp2 E3 ligase activity. Of these
residues, only the Skp2 Trp97Ala, Asp98Ala, and Trp127Ala mutants still retained their
binding capacity to Skp1, whereas the rest of other Skp2 mutants lost their interaction with
Skp1 (Figure 2B). The nature of the Arg126Ala mutant, which lost its ability to bind to
Skp1, precluded us to further examine the inhibitory effect of compound #25 on its E3 ligase
activity and binding to Skp1. For this reason, we focused on Skp2 Trp97Ala, Asp98Ala, and
Trp127Ala to determine the activity of compound #25 on their E3 ligase activity and
interaction with Skp1. While compound #25 abrogated E3 ligase activity of WT Skp2 and
Skp2 Trp127Ala mutant, as determined by in vivo p27 ubiquitination assay, it failed to

inhibit E3 ligase activity of Skp2 Trp97Ala and Asp98Ala mutants, (Figure 2C).
Furthermore, in vitro Skp2-Skp1 binding assays revealed that although compound #25
prevented the interaction between WT Skp2 and Skp1, it was unable to inhibit the binding of
Skp2 Trp97Ala and Asp98Ala mutants to Skp1 (Figure 2D). These results suggest that
Trp97 and Asp98 residues of Skp2 are critical sites for the binding of Skp2 to compound
#25.
To corroborate this notion, we performed the in vitro binding assay to compare the binding
affinity of compound #25 to WT Skp2 and Skp2 mutants (Trp97Ala and Asp98Ala) using
LC-MS/MS analysis. Of note, since the nature of recombinant Skp2 protein was unstable in
the absence of Skp1 (Li et al., 2005), the GST-Skp2 WT, GST-Skp2 Trp97Ala and GSTSkp2Asp98Ala mutants subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis were co-expressed, purified and
preformed complex with Skp1 (Figure S3A). In the preexisting Skp2-Skp1 complex, we
clearly detected that compound #25 readily bound to WT Skp2, but failed to interact with
the Trp97Ala and Asp98Ala mutants (Figure 2E and Figure S3B). Accordingly, our results
underscore that the binding of compound #25 to Skp2 at Trp97 and Asp98 is essential for
blocking Skp2 E3 ligase activity.
Skp2 inhibitor specifically suppresses the Skp2 SCF complex E3 ligase activity

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To evaluate the specificity of the compound #25, we determined whether compound #25
affects E3 ligase activity of other F-box proteins, such as Fbw7 and -TrCP. Although
compound #25 displayed a profound effect on Skp2-mediated ubiquitination of p27 and Akt
(Figures 1D, 1E, 1G, and 1F), it showed no appreciable effects on Fbw7-mediated
ubiquitination of c-Jun and MCL-1 or -TrCP-mediated ubiquitination of Snail and I B
(Figures 3A–3D). Consequently, compound #25 selectively stabilized expression of Skp2
substrates including p27, p21 and Notch1, but not Fbw7 substrates, such as c-Jun and
MCL-1 and -TrCP substrates, such as Snail, I B and -catenin (Figure 3E and Figure
S4A). In contrast, treatment of MLN4924, a potent inhibitor for Nedd8 activating enzyme
(NAE) that suppresses activity of Cullin-RING based ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) (Soucy et al.,
2009), attenuated Fbw7-mediated c-Jun ubiquitination (Figure S4B). Additionally,
substrates of SCF complexes, such as c-Jun, p27 and p21, were globally induced by
MLN4924 (Figure 3E). Of note, MLN4924 also induced expression of heat shock protein 27
(Hsp27), indicating that MLN4924 elicits heat shock response through globally inhibiting
intracellular proteolytic response (Figure 3E). These results underscore that compound #25
selectively targets E3 ligase activity of the Skp2-SCF complex but not other SCF
complexes.

Skp2 inhibitor restricts cancer cell survival through triggering p53-independent cellular
senescence and inhibiting aerobic glycolysis
Skp2 deficiency has a significant impact on cancer cell proliferation and survival by
triggering cellular senescence, apoptosis, or inactivation of glycolysis (Chan et al., 2011;
Chan et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2010; Yokoi et al., 2003). To test the therapeutic values of our
Skp2 inhibitor, we determined the impact of compound #25 on cancer cell proliferation and
survival. Indeed, compound #25 displayed potent effects on cell viability of prostate cancer
cell lines; including PC-3 and LNCaP cells, but only slightly affected cell viability of normal
prostate epithelial PNT1A cells (Figure 4A and Figure S5A). Our results indicate that
compound #25 has a great selectivity on proliferation of prostate cancer cells over normal
cells. We extended this finding to other cancer cell lines by showing that compound #25
favorably triggered cytotoxicity in tumorigenic lung cancer cells over non-tumorigenic lung
fibroblasts (Figure 4B and Figure S5A). Moreover, we found that it elicited a potent
suppressive effect on the viability of other human-tumor derived cell lines, including H3255

(lung), H1299 (lung), Hep3B (liver) and U2OS (osteocarcinoma), although different cancer
cell types exhibited variable sensitivity to the Skp2 inhibitor (Figure S5A).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next determined the underlying mechanism by which compound #25 regulates cancer
cell proliferation and survival. Consistent with the genetic Skp2 deficiency, our compound
#25 caused cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase (Figures S5B–5D). Also, it triggered cellular
senescence in p53-deficient prostate cancer cells, indicating that pharmacological Skp2
inactivation induced a p53-independent senescence response (Figure 4C). Moreover, Skp2
inhibition suppressed glycolysis in two prostate cancer cell lines similar to Akt inactivation,
as determined by lactate production (Figures 4D and 4E). In addition, compound #25 caused
higher apoptosis rates in cancer cells, consistent with the observations in Skp2-deficient cells
(Figure 4F and Figures S6A and S6B). These results, along with previous reports, illustrate
that genetic and pharmacological Skp2 inhibition attenuates cancer cell proliferation and
survival possibly through regulating p53-independent cellular senescence, aerobic glycolysis
or apoptosis.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine whether the biological effect of compound #25 is attributed to Skp2 inhibition,
we examined the effect of compound #25 on cell survival in control- and Skp2-knockdown
prostate cancer cells. While compound #25 displayed potent inhibitory effect on viability of
control-knockdown cells in a dose-dependent manner, its inhibitory effect is compromised
upon Skp2 silencing (Figure 4G and Figure S6C). We further demonstrated that ectopic
expression of Skp2 Trp97Ala or Skp2 Asp98Ala mutants, which is resistant to the binding
of compound #25, attenuated the inhibitory effect of compound #25 on cell viability (Figure
4H and Figure S6D). Taken together, our results indicate that the action of compound #25
on cancer cell viability acts through its Skp2 inhibition and binding.
Structure-activity relationships (SARs) of Skp2 inhibitor

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To explore the SARs of our Skp2 inhibitor, we have identified a series of compound #25
derivatives and evaluated their effects on in vitro Skp2-Skp1 binding (Figures 5A–5C). Our
data demonstrated that the benzothiazole at the R0 position of the chromone core is
necessary for binding, in agreement with our docking studies where it forms pi-stacking
interactions with residue Trp97. The change of this group to a small thiazole ring caused the
loss of activities (comparing #25 to #25-13 and #25-14 in Figures 5B and 5C), but
modifications to a comparable moiety such as benzoimidazole retained the activities
(#25-9). Apparently, the ethyl group on the R1 position is critical as the activities are
completely abolished when it is changed to hydrogen (e.g., #25 compared to #25-1 in
Figures 5A and 5C). This is consistent with our docking observations where this group
occupies the space where the Skp1 chain resides in the SCF complex. Our SAR analysis
indicated that any change to a big group (e.g., from hydrogen to methyl or ethyl ester) at the
R2 position is detrimental to the inhibitor binding (e.g. #25 compared to #25-10 and #25-12
in Figures 5B and 5C). This is also in agreement with our structural observations where the
R2 group has close contacts with Skp2 and therefore a small group is favorable to binding.
Additionally, the chromone core of compound #25 can be altered to chromen-2-one, as
compound #25-5 exhibited comparable ability to the lead compound (#25) in preventing
Skp2-Skp1 interactions (Figures 5A and 5C). We also found that modifications on the R3
position, such as from the lead compound #25 to #25-7 or #25-8, destroyed the inhibitor
activities. This is not surprising because in our docking models, we observed that the
piperidine ring is in a channel formed by residues Asp98 and Trp127. It is also in proximity
to residue Arg126. Therefore, a no-substituted ring structure is preferred (Figures 5A and
5C). This also supports our site-directed mutagenesis data that Asp98 is the critical binding
residue for Skp2 inhibitors (Figures 2 and 5A–5C). It is worth mentioning that the lack of
the ethyl group on #25-5 did not affect the activity significantly (Figures 5A and 5C)

Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 August 01.

Chan et al.

because this compound has a slightly altered binding pose due to its different core scaffold.
As a matter of fact, it seems that the piperidine moiety in #25-5 may partially serve the
function of the ethyl group to repel Skp1 away (data not shown).
Based on the SAR analysis, both compounds #25-5 and #25-9 disrupted in vitro Skp2-Skp1
binding as efficiently as lead compound #25 (Figures 5A–5C). To determine whether these
two derivatives exhibited the same biological efficacy as compound #25, we compared their
roles in Skp2 E3 ligase and cancer cell survival. As expected, they profoundly inhibited
Skp2-mediated p27 ubiquitination and cancer cell survival as compound #25 did, whereas
other derivatives failed to do so (Figures 5D and 5E). These data along with mutagenesis
results (Figures 2 and 5) collectively illustrate that the stable interactions with the Trp97 and
Asp98 residues is indispensible for the activities of Skp2 inhibitors in suppressing Skp2Skp1 binding, Skp2 E3 ligase activity, and cancer cell survival (Figures 2 and 5).
Skp2 inactivation inhibits cancer stem cell populations and self-renewal capability

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Like stem cells, cancer stem cells (CSCs, also known as cancer initiating cells) express
similar surface markers and possess asymmetric cell division and self-renewal capability.
CSCs have recently emerged to play roles in cancer initiation and progression (Rajan and
Srinivasan, 2008). However, how CSC’s populations and self-renewal ability are regulated
remains largely unclear. A recent report illustrated glycine decarboxylase drives CSC
properties and tumorigenesis by promoting aerobic glycolysis (Zhang et al., 2012). In
addition to glycolysis, cellular senescence through telomere shortening has been linked to
restrain CSC populations (Marian et al., 2010). In light of these observations, we reasoned
that targeting aerobic glycolysis pathways and inducing cellular senescence may reduce
CSC self-renewal and favor chemotherapy sensitivity.
As Skp2 regulates p53-independent cellular senescence and Akt-mediated aerobic
glycolysis, we determined whether Skp2 inactivation has any effect on CSC populations and
their self-renewal capability. Both Skp2 knockdown and pharmacological Skp2 inactivation
in prostate cancer cells reduced CSC populations, similar to what inhibition of the PI3K-Akt
pathway did (Figures 6A–6E). Moreover, we found while compound #25 reduced the
population of prostate CSCs in a dose dependent manner, it failed to do so upon Skp2
silencing. This data underscores the fact that Skp2-regulated CSC pool size strictly depends
on Skp2 (Figure 6C). The prostate sphere formation assay also revealed that Skp2 inhibition
by genetic and pharmacological approaches markedly suppressed self-renewal ability of
prostate CSCs, so did Akt inactivation (Figures 6F and 6G). These results uncover a crucial
role of Skp2 in regulating CSC population and self-renewal capability.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The existence of CSCs is the major cause for cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy (Koch
et al., 2010). As genetic and pharmacological Skp2 inactivation effectively restricts CSCs
properties in prostate cancer cells (Figure 6), we reasoned that our Skp2 inhibitor may
sensitize cancer cell response to chemotherapy agents, such as doxorubicin (Dox) and
cyclophosphamide (CPA). As expected, Skp2 inhibition increased the efficacy of Dox and
CPA on prostate cancer cells (Figures 7A and 7B), indicating that our Skp2 inhibitor may
overcome chemo-resistance via eradicating CSC populations.
Pharmacological Skp2 inactivation exhibits strong anti-tumor activities in vivo
Escape of cellular senescence and promotion of aerobic glycolysis are two critical hallmarks
for cancer progression and cancer drug resistance, and targeting these two events are
therefore ideal approaches for cancer treatment. Since we have shown that compound #25
effectively triggers senescence and inhibits glycolysis, we then examined the efficacy of
compound #25 on suppression of preexisting tumors in vivo. Figures 7C and 7D

demonstrated that compound #25 displayed a potent effect on inhibiting prostate and lung
tumor growth in vivo. Importantly, compound #25 restricted tumor growth in a dosedependent fashion. Of note, compound #25 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in Skp2
levels in tumor tissues, correlated with in vivo upregulation of p27, p21 and apoptosis, and
downregulation of cancer cell proliferation, Akt activity and Glut1 (glucose transporter 1)
expression, which are both critical regulators for glycolysis (Figures 7D–7F and Figures
S7A and S7B). The pharmacokinetic analysis further revealed that the concentration of
compound #25 reached maximum levels in blood 1h after IP administration (Cmax was
1428±1185 ng/ml), maintained up to 70 % of the compound for 6h, but quickly declined
afterward with a terminal concentration of 126±48 ng/ml 24h after administration (Figure
S7C). Of note, compound #25 indeed reached tumors within 1h with a concentration of
4787±1967 ng/g and slowly declined in tumor tissues and about 1164±494 ng/ml of
compound #25 remained in tumor tissues 24h after initial administration (Figure S7C). Our
results collectively provide convincing pharmacological evidence that Skp2 targeting
represents a promising strategy and open an avenue for the treatment of human cancers.

Discussion
Characterization of modes of action of the specific Skp2 inhibitor

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Skp2 is frequently upregulated in human cancer and plays a critical role in cancer
development by targeting p27 protein degradation or activating Akt signaling, and therefore
is regarded as a drug target. Recently, small molecules targeting the p27 pathways were
identified: a small molecule cpdA targeting p27 ubiquitination (Chen et al., 2008), small
molecules interrupting Skp2-p27 binding (Wu et al., 2012). Although cpdA could cause cell
growth defects in vitro, it is unclear how cpdA regulates p27 ubiquitination and whether it
has any direct effect on Skp2 activity. Small molecule inhibitors identified by Timothy
Cardozo’s group were shown to interrupt Skp2-p27 binding but retain the Skp1-Skp2
complex formation, suggesting these inhibitors presumably will not affect Skp2 E3 ligase
activity. Furthermore, the biological efficacy on tumor growth of either cpdA or the
inhibitors identified by Timothy Cardozo’s group remains elusive. In our study, we found
that compound #25 is a specific Skp2 inhibitor by directly binding to the F-box motif of
Skp2, thus preventing Skp2-Skp1 interactions and subsequently abrogating Skp2 E3 ligase
activity toward ubiquitination of p27 and Akt in vivo. Interestingly, our data revealed that
Skp2 inhibitor #25 when used at higher doses not only prevents Skp1-Skp2 complex
formation, but also induces Skp2 degradation in a manner partially dependent on the
proteasome, indicating that the Skp2 degradation induced by the Skp2 inhibitor is likely
caused by its effect on preventing Skp1-Skp2 complex formation. This notion is consistent
with the fact that recombinant Skp2 protein becomes unstable in the absence of Skp1 (Li et
al., 2005). Remarkably, compound #25 does not affect activity of other F-Box proteins
including Fbw7 and -TrCP. Future studies are required to characterize the impact of the
Skp2 inhibitor on other F-box proteins.
It should be noted that while Skp2 inhibitor #25 could prevent the assembly of Skp2-Skp1
complex in vitro and in vivo (Figure 1B and 1C), it failed to disrupt the preexisting Skp2Skp1 complex in vitro (data now shown). However, we noticed that in the preformed Skp2Skp1 complex in vitro, compound #25 could still specifically bind to Skp2 (Figure 2E and
Figure S3) and inactivate Skp2 activity as determined by in vitro ubiquitination of p27 and
Akt (Figures 1E and 1H). Moreover, we found that compound #25 binds to Trp97 and
Asp98 residues of Skp2 and such binding is required for its actions (Figures 2C and 4H).
Collectively, our results suggest that two modes of action by Skp2 inhibitor #25 are likely
operated in cells. We propose that the primary mechanism of Skp2 inhibitor #25 on Skp2 E3
ligase activity is to prevent the assembly of newly synthesized Skp2-Skp1 complex by

binding to Skp2. Another mode of #25 action against Skp2 activity is through its binding to
preformed Skp1–Skp2 complex. Nevertheless, both actions of compound #25 on the
assembly of newly synthesized Skp2-Skp1 complex or preexisting Skp2-Skp1 complex are
attributed to specific Skp2-compound #25 binding, thereby inactivating its E3 ligase
activity.
Molecular docking and SAR analysis reveals crucial structural features for Skp2 inhibitor
activity

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The high-throughput virtual screening employed in the current study allowed us to identify
compound #25 as a specific Skp2 inhibitor and reveals its structural binding mechanism
(Figure 1 and S1A) to Skp2. Based on the prediction; it was observed that Trp97 is the
essential residue which directly interacts with the benzothiazole substructure of compound
#25. We also found that Leu105, Ile108, Phe109, and Trp127 form a hydrophobic pocket
that is critical for Skp1 binding and may be used to design more potent inhibitors than
compound #25. In support of this notion, our mutagenesis data showed that the mutations of
these residues to alanine abolished the Skp2-Skp1 interaction. In agreement with the
prediction by molecular modeling, Skp2 Trp97Ala and Asp98Ala mutants failed to interact
with compound #25, thereby displaying resistance to our inhibitors. Furthermore, derivatives
of compound #25 with a bulky group at the R1 but not the R2 position are favorable to the
inhibitory activities of interfering with Skp2-Skp1 complex formation and Skp2 activity.
The docking and SAR analysis of Skp2 inhibitors not only is consistent with our
experimental notion that Trp97 and Asp98 residues are indispensible for the binding of
inhibitors, but also provides important information to guide our future chemical optimization
of lead compound #25.
Skp2 regulates CSC population and functions
CSCs are regarded as seeds for cancer initiation, progression, and relapse after
chemotherapy (Rajan and Srinivasan, 2008). Thus, orchestrating the populations and
functions of CSCs may help thwart cancer progression and improve the efficacy of current
chemotherapy agents. Our findings using the genetic (Skp2 knockdown) and
pharmacological (Skp2 inhibitors) approaches demonstrated that Skp2 inactivation reduces
CSC populations and their ability to form prostate spheres (Figure 6), suggesting that Skp2
is a previously uncharacterized, key regulator for the maintenance of CSCs. Given that Skp2
targeting attenuates aerobic glycolysis and induces cellular senescence in cancer cells, our
study implies that targeting glycolysis and inducing cellular senescence pathways may
represent attractive strategies for CSC elimination.

Pharmacological Skp2 inhibition in treatment of cancer and other diseases
We discovered for the first time specific Skp2 inhibitors targeting Skp2 SCF complex
formation by using in silico high-throughput screening of a large chemical database. These
inhibitors were validated for their effects on preventing Skp2-Skp1 interaction, inhibiting
Skp2 SCF E3 ligase activity toward ubiquitination of p27 and Akt, and repressing in vivo
tumor growth. Importantly, we also revealed a critical function of Skp2 in governing CSC
properties (Figure 7G). Our study provides proof of principle that pharmacological Skp2
inactivation could profoundly restrict cancer developments in various cancer models and
confer sensitivity to chemotherapy, supporting the notion that Skp2 is a promising drug
target for human cancers.
Not only does Skp2 regulate glucose metabolism and therefore endows cancer development,
but also it plays an essential role in other metabolic disorder such as obesity, evidenced by a
previous report demonstrating that Skp2 ablation protect mice from developing obesity
through reducing adipocyte proliferation (Sakai et al., 2007). Having shown the promise of

the Skp2 inhibitor in suppressing glycolysis, it would be interesting to test whether Skp2
inhibitors could be applied for anti-obesity therapy in the future. As such, our current study
opens up an avenue in multiple therapeutic areas that can translate basic findings into the
clinical setting, thereby offering great opportunity and impact on treatment of cancer as well
as other metabolic disorders.

Experimental Procedures
Cell culture and reagents
293T, PC3, A549, H460, H1299, Hep3B and U2OS cells were cultured in DMEM
containing 10% FBS while LNCaP and H3255 were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium
containing 10% FBS. (His)6-ubiquitin, GST-Akt, and HA-Akt constructs was described
previously (Yang et al., 2009). Flag-Skp2 was a gift from Dr. W. Wei. GST-Skp2 Trp97Ala
(W97A) and GST-Skp2 Asp98Ala (D98A) mutants were generated in pGEXSkp2 NSkp1 , a gift from Dr. B.A. Schulman, by site-directed mutagenesis assay according to
manufacturers’ standard procedures (Stratagene). Compound #25 and its analytical data
including 1H, 13C NMR and LC-MS/MS analysis were obtained from ChemBridge.
LY294002 was purchased from Cell signaling.

GST-Skp2 W97A and GST-Skp2 D98A mutants used for demonstrating #25-Skp2
interaction (Figure 2E) were generated in pGEXSkp2 N-Skp1 bicistronic coexpression
constructs. Subsequently, the GST-Skp2 WT, GST-Skp2 W97A and GST-Skp2 D98A
mutants were co-expressed, purified and formed complex with Skp1 ( 38–44 a.a.) as
described previously (Li et al., 2005). The purified proteins were incubated with compound
#25 for overnight at 4°C, and the GST tags were thrombin-cleaved and pulled-down by
glutathione sepharose beads (Invitrogen). The untagged protein samples were pH-adjusted
by adding 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and digested by adding 200 ng modified trypsin
(sequencing grade, Promega) for 18 hrs at 37°C. The resulting peptides and compound were
analyzed by LC-MS/MS on an Orbitrap-Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific,
Waltham MA). Proteins were identified by database searching of the fragment spectra
against the SwissProt (EBI) protein database using Mascot (v 2.3, Matrix Science, London,
UK). Typical search settings were: mass tolerances, 10 ppm precursor, 0.8d fragments;
variable modifications, methionine sulfoxide, pyro-glutamate formation; up to 2 missed
cleavages. The extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) for the bound compounds were
examined and peak heights were analyzed and quantified by using Qual Browser (Thermo).
The identity of the bound compound shown in XIC (Figure 2E) was further confirmed by
MS/MS analysis as shown in Figure S3B.
In vivo drug treatment in the preclinical tumor model
Nude mice bearing A549 xenograft tumors (around 100 mm3) were administrated with
vehicle or 80 mg/kg of compound #25 through intraperitoneal (IP) injection, while mice
bearing PC3 xenograft tumors (around 180 mm3) were administrated with vehicle, 40 mg/kg
or 80 mg/kg of compound #25, respectively, on a daily basis. Tumor size was measured
weekly with a caliper, and tumor volume was calculated by using the standard formula: L ×
W2 × 0.52, where L and W are the length and width, respectively. For mouse
pharmacokinetic studies, nude mice bearing PC3 xenograft tumors (around 200 mm3) were
administrated with 80 mg/kg of compound #25 through IP injection with a single dosage.
Plasma and tumor samples were then harvested from euthanized mice at the indicated time
and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. 100 µl of plasma were incubated with 2× volume of
acetonitrile, mixed and then centrifuged at maximum speed for 3–5 minutes. Tumor tissues
were weighed, added with methanol to a wt/vol concentration of 25 mg/mL, and

homogenized on ice using a handheld tissue homogenizer. 100 µl of tissue homogenate were
mixed with 100 µl of 0.2% formic acid and 100µl of acetonitrile for 5 min., incubated on ice
for an additional 10 min and centrifuged. Afterward, 200 µl of clear supernatant from
plasma or tumor homogenate were subjected to a HPLC vial for analysis by LC/MS/MS on
a Waters Acquity Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer to determine the concentration of
compound #25.
