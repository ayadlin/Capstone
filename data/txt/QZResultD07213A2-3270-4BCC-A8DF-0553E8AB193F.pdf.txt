in Ewing sarcoma

The Ewing sarcoma (ES) EWS-FLI1 chimeric oncoprotein is a prototypic aberrant ETS transcription factor with activating and
repressive regulatory functions. We report that EWS-FLI1-repressed promoters are enriched in forkhead box (FOX) recognition
motifs, and identify FOXO1 as a EWS-FLI1-suppressed regulator orchestrating a major subset of EWS-FLI1-repressed genes. In
addition to FOXO1 regulation by direct promoter binding of EWS-FLI1, its subcellular localization and activity is regulated by cyclindependent kinase 2- and AKT-mediated phosphorylation downstream of EWS-FLI1. Restoration of nuclear FOXO1 expression in ES
cells impaired proliferation and signiﬁcantly reduced clonogenicity. Gene-expression proﬁling revealed a signiﬁcant overlap
between EWS-FLI1-repressed and FOXO1-activated genes. As a proof of principle for a potential therapeutic application of our
ﬁndings, the treatment of ES cell lines with methylseleninic acid (MSA) reactivated endogenous FOXO1 in the presence of EWS-FLI1
in a dose- and time-dependent manner and induced massive cell death dependent on FOXO1. In an orthotopic xenograft mouse
model, MSA increased FOXO1 expression in the tumor paralleled by a signiﬁcant decrease in ES tumor growth. FOXO1 reactivation
by small molecules may therefore serve as a promising strategy for a future ES-speciﬁc therapy.

INTRODUCTION
Ewing sarcoma (ES) is characterized by aberrant activation of ETS
transcription factors due to rearrangement with the EWS gene.
The most common gene fusion combines EWS with FLI1,1 which
has a rate-limiting role in ES pathogenesis,2 as interference with
EWS-FLI1 expression or function results in tumor regression in vivo
and dysregulates ES tumor cell growth in vitro.3
Although experimental evidence suggests that the EWS domain
confers transcription activating properties to EWS-FLI1,4 knockdown
of EWS-FLI1 uncovers similar numbers of repressed and activated
genes.5–7 We focused on the repressive EWS-FLI1 regulatory
network as the mechanisms and mediators of transcriptional
repression downstream of EWS-FLI1 are poorly understood. We
identiﬁed the enrichment of forkhead box (FOX) recognition motifs
in EWS-FLI1-repressed genes. FOX transcription factors are a
superfamily of more than 100 structurally related proteins with a
conserved 100-residue DNA-binding domain, the forkhead domain.
In humans, 19 subgroups named FOXA–FOXS have been discovered.8 The O-class includes FOXO1, FOXO3, FOXO4 and FOXO6.9
Importantly, FOXO proteins function as tumor suppressors by their
capacity to induce cell-cycle arrest,10 apoptosis and DNA repair11 as
well as modulate the expression of genes responsive to oxidative
stress and cell differentiation.12 FOXO proteins are regulated by
post-translational modiﬁcations involving phosphorylation,
acetylation and ubiquitinylation.13 Subcellular localization and
DNA-binding ability of FOXO transcription factors are regulated in

response to external and internal stimuli by protein kinases such as
AKT and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2).12
Integrating expression data and binding-motif preferences, we
identify FOXO1 repression as a growth limiting regulatory
pathway downstream of EWS-FLI1 and as a potential target in
ES. Here, we report that a major subset of the EWS-FLI1 repressive
signature is comprised by FOXO1 target genes. We identify several
layers of FOXO1 dysregulation by EWS-FLI1 and provide evidence
that therapeutic reactivation of FOXO1 interferes with ES growth
in vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS
EWS-FLI1-repressed genes show enrichment of FOX recognition
motifs
To elucidate the transcriptional network downstream of EWS-FLI1,
we analyzed time-resolved gene-expression proﬁles upon conditional EWS-FLI1 knockdown in A673sh cells. Promoter regions of
knockdown-responsive genes were analyzed for the presence of
transcription factor-binding motifs. Whereas EWS-FLI1-activated
promoters (suppressed upon modulation of EWS-FLI1) revealed
strong enrichment of ETS-binding motifs, EWS-FLI1-repressed
gene promoters (activated upon EWS-FLI1 silencing) showed
prominent over-representation of recognition motifs for FOX
transcription factors while lacking enrichment of ETS motifs
(Figure 1a). This result is consistent with a model where EWS-FLI1

mainly acts as a direct transcriptional activator, and suggests a role
for FOX family members in EWS-FLI1-mediated gene repression.
Several FOX proteins, including FOXO1 and FOXO3, are regulated
by EWS-FLI1 at the transcriptional level
The enrichment of FOX motifs within EWS-FLI1-repressed promoters prompted us to investigate which FOX candidates are per se
regulated by EWS-FLI1 in ES. Inspection of expression data of the
inducible EWS-FLI1 knockdown as well as of ﬁve additional ES cell
lines with transient EWS-FLI1 knockdown (previously described6)
revealed consistently differential expression of FOXO1 and of the
related FOXO3 between control and EWS-FLI1 knockdown
conditions (Figure 1b and Kauer et al.6). Furthermore, FOXO1 is
expressed at lower levels in primary ES compared with a wide
variety of tissues14 (Figure 1d), and its promoter is directly bound
by EWS-FLI1 in chromatin immunopreciptation-PCR experiments
(Figure 1e).15 The FOXO3 promoter, though, was not directly
bound by EWS-FLI1 (data not shown) and shows higher expression
in ES than in most other tissues (Figure 1d). Finally, position weight
matrices (sequence logos, Figure 1c) of ES expressed FOX-factors
were found to be very similar. Therefore, combining the motif
analysis with gene expression data, FOXO1 and FOXO3 emerged as
candidate regulatory transcription factors for a repressive transcriptional sub-signature downstream of EWS-FLI1.
Subcellular localization of FOXO1 is regulated by EWS-FLI1
We next tested the subcellular localization of FOXO1 and FOXO3
when expressed in A673sh cells. In the presence of EWS-FLI1, both
ectopic Flag-FOXO1 and Flag-FOXO3 were found excluded from
the nucleus. Upon the silencing of EWS-FLI1, however, Flag-FOXO1
but not Flag-FOXO3 readily translocated to the nucleus
(Figure 2a). We also monitored endogenous FOXO1 and FOXO3
proteins by immunoblotting and observed strong FOXO1 induction and only weakly increased FOXO3 levels upon EWS-FLI1
knockdown. FOXO1 was conﬁned to the cytoplasm and the
nucleus, whereas FOXO3 was exclusively retained in the cytoplasm
(Figure 2b). Although the cytoplasmic increase in FOXO1
expression was already detectable at 16 h of doxycycline
treatment (the earliest time point of EWS-FLI1 knockdown),
nuclear FOXO1 was ﬁrst observed at 36 h (Figure 2c). Our ﬁndings
suggest that EWS-FLI1 regulates FOXO1 not only at the transcriptional level but also affects its subcellular localization thereby
controlling FOXO1 transcriptional activity.
FOXO1 is tightly regulated by CDK2- and AKT-mediated
phosphorylation in ES
The subcellular localization of FOXO1 and FOXO3 transcription
factors is known to be mainly regulated by post-translational
phosphorylation.12 Mining the gene expression data upon EWSFLI1 knockdown in A673sh cells and in ﬁve additional ES cell
lines,6 and of our EWS-FLI1 chromatin immunoprecipitation-seq

data, we identiﬁed CDK2, a well-known negative regulator of
FOXO1 transcriptional activity,16 among EWS-FLI1-induced genes6
(Supplementary Figure 1). In addition, it has been reported that
PI3K/AKT-mediated phosphorylation negatively regulates FOXO1/
3 nuclear localization and consequently activity.11 To investigate
whether CDK2 and/or AKT have a role in nuclear exclusion of
FOXO1/3 downstream of EWS-FLI1, we treated A673sh cells with
the inhibitors roscovitine and LY294002 alone, or in combination,
to inhibit CDK2 and AKT activity, respectively (Figure 3a and
Supplementary Figure 2a). At concentrations that did not induce
toxicity but only mild signs of apoptosis, both inhibitors
signiﬁcantly restored nuclear localization of ectopically expressed
Flag-FOXO1 (Figures 3a and b), whereas Flag-FOXO3 remained in
the cytoplasm (Supplementary Figures 2a and b). Coupled with
the absence of nuclear translocation upon EWS-FLI1 knockdown,
this result made FOXO3 unlikely to participate in the gene
regulatory network downstream of EWS-FLI1.
To test the importance of CDK2- and AKT-mediated phosphorylation for the transcriptional activity of FOXO1, we transiently
transfected A673sh cells with phosphorylation-resistant FOXO1
mutants. We used Flag-FOXO1-T24A/S256A/S319A (Flag-FOXO1AAA) and Flag-FOXO1-S249A/S298A, in which AKT, respectively,
CDK2-speciﬁc phosphorylation sites were converted to alanine.16,17
Both FOXO1 mutants localized to the nucleus (Supplementary
Figure 2c). As treatment with roscovitine or mutation of residues
S249 and S298 was sufﬁcient to restore nuclear FOXO1 expression,
we hypothesized that CDK2 had a central role in FOXO1 regulation
downstream of EWS-FLI1. To test this, we performed knockdown
experiments targeting endogenous CDK2 with speciﬁc short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) in the presence of EWS-FLI1. As shown in
Figures 3c–e, transiently transfected Flag-FOXO1wt was signiﬁcantly expressed higher in the nucleus when endogenous CDK2
was concomitantly silenced. No inﬂuence on subcellular FOXO1
localization was observed using a scrambled shRNA control. These
results conﬁrm a rate-limiting role for CDK2 in nuclear FOXO1
exclusion in EWS-FLI1-expressing ES cells.
A repressive sub-signature of EWS-FLI1 regulated genes is due to
suppression of FOXO1
To test for the contribution of FOXO1 inactivation to the EWS-FLI1
repressive transcriptional signature, the overlap between genes
reactivated upon EWS-FLI1 knockdown and (i) genes rescued from
the reactivation after combined EWS-FLI1 and FOXO1 silencing
and (ii) genes activated by ectopically expressed, nuclear directed
FOXO1 were determined (Figure 4a). In these experiments, 973
genes were found signiﬁcantly (logFC41, Po0.05) activated after
EWS-FLI1 knockdown. A double-knockdown of EWS-FLI1 and
FOXO1 resulted in downregulation of 306 genes (logFCo  0.7,
Po0.05). The overlap of this gene set with 973 EWS-FLI1-repressed
genes contained 94 genes (Po10  10, hypergeometric test). Upon
overexpression of AKT- or CDK2-phosphorylation-resistant FOXO1
mutants, 208 and 184 genes, respectively, were upregulated by

control, from  9071 to  8888 further upstream. ETS-binding sites (GGAA core motif )6 within these regions were identified using the
ConSite tool.50 Specific ETS motifs responsible for FLI1 binding are ACGGAAG for fragment (  609/  412) and TAGGAAG/CGGGAAG for
fragment (  961/  736), respectively. Signals for EWS-FLI1 binding were obtained exclusively for the two promoter fragments in the presence
of EWS-FLI1, but were completely abrogated upon 48 h of doxycycline-induced knockdown of EWS-FLI1. Input DNA and ChIPs using an
immunoglobulin G (IgG) control antibody were used for specificity control.

FOXO1 constructs were similar to endogenous FOXO1 expression
after doxycycline-induced EWS-FLI1 knockdown (Figure 4e). Of
these, 94 and 58 genes, respectively, were also found upregulated

upon EWS-FLI1 knockdown. These overlaps are highly signiﬁcant
(Po10  10, hypergeometric test). Thus, a signiﬁcant overlap
between FOXO1-activated and EWS-FLI1-repressed genes was
identiﬁed as measured by three different approaches. Validation

Figure 2. Subcellular localization of FOXO1 in A673sh cells is dependent on EWS-FLI1. (a) Immunofluorescence analysis of FOXO1 and FOXO3
subcellular localization in the presence or absence of EWS-FLI1. Flag-tagged FOXO1 or FOXO3 was transfected into A673sh cells in the
absence and presence of doxycycline-induced EWS-FLI1 knockdown for 48 h post transfection, and subcellular localization was monitored by
immunofluorescence using FLAG-tag-specific antibody (red) with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole counterstain to delineate cell nuclei (blue).
In the presence of EWS-FLI1, FOXO1 and FOXO3 stainings were confined exclusively to the cytoplasm. Upon EWS-FLI1 knockdown, only
ectopically expressed FOXO1 but not FOXO3 translocated to the nucleus. (b) Immunoblot analysis of endogenous FOXO1 expression in
cytoplasmic and nuclear cell fractions of A673sh cells. Basal expression of endogenous FOXO1 and FOXO3 in the presence of EWS-FLI1 was
detectable exclusively in the cytoplasm. However, upon knockdown of EWS-FLI1 by doxycycline treatment for 48 h, FOXO1 expression was
significantly increased and also expressed in the nucleus, whereas FOXO3 remained in the cytoplasm. In concordance with this observation,
the levels of inactive phosphorylated FOXO1 and FOXO3 were reduced upon knockdown of EWS-FLI1. Note, that the double-bandappearance of FOXO1 is due to unspecific antibody recognition of both phosphorylated (upper) and unphosphorylated (lower) FOXO1
protein. (c) Kinetics of endogenous FOXO1 protein expression upon doxycycline-induced EWS-FLI1 knockdown in A673sh cells.
Downregulation of EWS-FLI1 was already observed at 16 h, the time when cytoplasmic FOXO1 induction became first detectable, whereas
significant nuclear FOXO1 expression was first observed at 36 h of doxycycline treatment with strongest expression at 48 h. Scale bars: 10 mM.

of these results was performed by reverse transcription–
quantitative PCR on three arbitrarily chosen genes (EPAS1 and
MME also show FOXO1-binding sites in the TRANSFAC (transcription factor database) from the overlap of genes that were found
signiﬁcant in all three experimental settings using two ES cell lines.
Reactivation of endogenous FOXO1 as a consequence of
doxycycline-induced EWS-FLI1 knockdown led to the transcriptional induction of all three tested genes in A673sh cells, which
was largely abolished upon RNA interference knockdown of
FOXO1 (Figures 4b and d and Supplementary Figure 3a). Likewise,
signiﬁcant re-repression of EPAS1 and MME was observed in TC252
cells after EWS-FLI knockdown, whereas OSMR did not respond, a
cell line-speciﬁc difference in the repressive signature of EWS-FLI1
(Figure 4c and Supplementary Figure 3e). Similar results were
obtained using a second shRNA targeting endogenous FOXO1 in
A673sh cells (Supplementary Figures 3b–d). In contrast to wildtype FOXO1, the introduction of AKT-phosphorylation-resistant
FOXO1 signiﬁcantly increased the expression of EPAS1 and
MME in A673sh and TC252 cells, whereas OSMR was only
induced in A673sh cells (Figures 4f and g and Supplementary
Figures 3f and g). In contrast, despite nuclear localization
(Supplementary Figure 2c), CDK2-phosphorylation-resistant
FOXO1 failed to reactivate these genes (Figures 4f and g). These
& 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited

results are consistent with nuclear CDK2-phosphorylation-resistant
FOXO1 remaining subject to AKT-mediated phosphorylation,
which was previously reported to lead to functional dissociation
from DNA as a consequence of 14-3-3 binding.18 We therefore
speculate, that even though the CDK2-phosphorylation-resistant
FOXO1 mutant accumulates within the cell nucleus, the ability to
induce target gene transcription is limited. Taken together, these
data conﬁrm our hypothesis that a repressive sub-signature of
EWS-FLI1 regulated genes is due to the suppression of FOXO1.
Functional restoration of nuclear FOXO1 expression in ES results in
impaired proliferation and reduced colony formation capability
As FOXO proteins are known to regulate the cell cycle inducing G1
arrest,19 we asked whether the restoration of nuclear FOXO1
functionally affects the proliferative activity of ES cells in vitro.
A673sh and SK-N-MC cells were transfected with CDK2- and AKTphosphorylation-resistant FOXO1 in the presence of EWS-FLI1.
Control cells were transfected with empty vector or FOXO1wt.
Proliferation of viable cells was monitored 4 days post
transfection. As shown in Figures 5a and b, both A673sh and
SK-N-MC exhibited signiﬁcantly reduced proliferation upon
restoration of nuclear FOXO1 compared with cells transfected

grow under anchorage-independent conditions is considered a
hallmark of oncogenic transformation.20 When seeded into soft
agar, the number of colonies formed by A673sh and SK-N-MC cells
after 2 weeks was signiﬁcantly reduced upon expression of
nuclear FOXO1 compared with FOXO1wt and the empty vector
control (Figures 5c and d). As colony sizes did not differ
dramatically between control-transfectants and cells expressing
nuclear-targeted FOXO1, the observed signiﬁcant reduction in
& 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited

colony number cannot be solely attributed to reduced proliferation but to decreased clonogenicity. Taken together, these results
suggest that FOXO1 has an important role in ES oncogenesis.
Methylseleninic acid reactivates endogenous FOXO1 in a doseand time-dependent manner
As we found endogenous FOXO1 to be negatively regulated
by EWS-FLI1 at transcriptional and post-translational levels in ES,

a chemical compound, methylseleninic acid (MSA), previously
shown to reactivate FOXO1 in prostate cancer cells,21 was
investigated in a proof of principle study for its potential to
reactivate FOXO1 activity in ES cells.

Four different ES cell lines were treated with increasing MSA
concentrations and the levels of endogenous FOXO1 protein were
monitored by immunoblotting. As shown in Figure 6a, FOXO1 was

monitored until day 21. A distribution-free test for tumor growth curve analyses revealed an overall significant difference between the MSA
group versus the PBS group (P ¼ 0.0403). Furthermore, significant differences were observed between the MSA group and the PBS group at
different times as measured by the Wilcoxon two sample test (day 10, P ¼ 0.04283; day 12, P ¼ 0.03604; day 14, P ¼ 0.04283; day 19,

expression between 2.5 and 5 mM MSA. FOXO1 protein expression
peaked at 16 h (Figure 6b), whereas mRNA levels were already
induced between 2 and 4 h of MSA treatment and declined
gradually thereafter (Supplementary Figures 4a and b). These
ﬁndings suggest that MSA not only induces FOXO1 protein
expression but also regulates FOXO1 at the mRNA level. As shown
in Figure 6b, the quantiﬁcation of FOXO1 protein expression
revealed a three to ﬁvefold induction upon MSA treatment which
was comparable with FOXO1 protein levels after the EWS-FLI1
knockdown (three to sixfold, data not shown). Notably, MSA
treatments led to nuclear FOXO1 expression in the presence of
EWS-FLI1 both in vitro (Supplementary Figures 4c and d), and
in vivo (Supplementary Figure 4e). This observation was accompanied by reduced cytoplasmic P-FOXO1 levels, presumably as a
consequence of MSA-induced reduction of P-AKT.22
MSA induces cell death which is dependent on FOXO1 expression
and reduces tumor growth in vivo
To analyze the effect of MSA on ES cell survival, A673 and SK-N-MC
cell lines were treated with different concentrations of MSA for
16 h and subsequently processed for ﬂow cytometric cell death
analysis. Apoptotic (Annexin-V-positive cells) and DAPI (4’,6diamidino-2-phenylindole)-positive necrotic cells were counted
together to monitor overall cell death induction as shown in
Figure 6c. At a ﬁnal concentration of 5 mM MSA, the proportion of
drug-induced cell death approached 30–40% in both cell lines.
To clarify whether FOXO1 was involved in MSA-induced cell
death, we transiently transfected SK-N-MC and A673 ES cells with
either sh-scrambled control or sh-RNA targeting endogenous
FOXO1 followed by MSA treatment (5 mM) for 24 h (Supplementary
Figures 5a and b). In both cell lines, induction of cell death was
induced in sh-scrambled controls, whereas the knockdown of
endogenously induced FOXO1 signiﬁcantly reduced the apoptotic
MSA effect, suggesting that FOXO1 is at least partially involved in
MSA-induced cell death (Figure 6d).To assess the potential of MSA
to reduce ES tumor growth in vivo, we used an orthotopic mouse
xenotransplantation model. SK-N-MC cells (2  106) were directly
injected into the m. gastrocnemius of severe combined immune
deﬁciency/bg mice. Mice bearing tumors bigger than 100 mm3 at
day 0 were excluded from the analysis to avoid heterogeneity in
MSA take-rate.23 Mice were observed for a period of 21 days after
starting MSA treatments. As shown in Figure 6e, tumor growth
was signiﬁcantly reduced in the MSA group compared with
phosphate-buffered saline control mice. The tumors exhibited a
small round cell phenotype characteristic of ES, as shown by
representative hematoxylin and eosin stains (Figure 6f).
Notably, the MSA-mediated inhibitory growth effect on ES
tumors persisted beyond the treatment period and tumor growth
delay was accompanied by increased FOXO1 protein levels
(Figures 6g and h), suggesting a potent anti-tumorigenic activity
of MSA.

DISCUSSION
EWS-FLI1 has been proposed as the ideal therapeutic target
in ES,24 but hitting nuclear transcription factors by small
molecules remains a challenge. Intervention with the downstream transcriptional network of EWS-FLI1 may offer an
alternative treatment option. Very little is known about the
mechanisms of EWS-FLI1-mediated gene repression, even though
there is evidence that part of its repressive signature can be
assigned to activation of transcriptional repressors NKX2.2
and NR0B1,25,26 to epigenetic mechanisms involving the NuRD
(Nucleosome remodelling and deacetylation) complex27 or to
post-transcriptional mechanisms.28
Here, we report that EWS-FLI1 exerts a signiﬁcant part of its
transcriptional repression activity via inhibition of the forkhead
& 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited

Figure 7. The transcriptional activity of FOXO1 is regulated in a
multilayered manner. EWS-FLI1 not only represses the transcription
of FOXO1 but also affects P-AKT levels and regulates CDK2 activity,
thus regulating FOXO1 transcriptional activity on a post-translational level. Blocking the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway with the
canonical PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or by blocking active CDK2 with
roscovitine can overcome the repressive effect of EWS-FLI1 as
shown for ectopically expressed FOXO1wt.

transcription factor FOXO1. Our in vitro data show that FOXO1 is
tightly regulated in a multilayered manner by EWS-FLI1-mediated
transcriptional repression and inhibitory phosphorylation by EWSFLI1-induced CDK2 and AKT (summarized in Figure 7).
There is ample experimental evidence that AKT and CDK2
regulate the subcellular localization of FOXO1 independently of
each other. In ES, the PI3K pathway is essential for cellular
survival,29,30 activated by growth factors such as insulin-like
growth factor-1. It was previously shown that insulin-like growth
factor-binding protein is directly suppressed by EWS-FLI1
sustaining the activation of this signaling pathway.31 Treatment
with recombinant insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3
drastically decreased levels of phosphorylated AKT in ES cells31 as
a consequence of decreased phosphorylation of insulin-like
growth factor-1 receptor.32 Consistent with these ﬁndings, our
analysis revealed that using a phosphorylation-resistant version of
FOXO1, AKT-mediated nuclear exclusion was abrogated. On the
other hand, CDK2 was reported to functionally interact with
FOXO1 leading to phosphorylation at two speciﬁc serine residues
(S249/S298) followed by nuclear exclusion.16 Interestingly,
chromatin immunoprecipitation-seq (not shown), expression and
reporter-gene analyses (Supplementary Figure 1c) identiﬁed CDK2
as an EWS-FLI1-induced target, suggesting an important role for
CDK2 in FOXO1 repression by EWS-FLI1. Here, we show that
knockdown of CDK2 was sufﬁcient to drive ectopically expressed
FOXO1 into the nucleus of ES cells even in the presence of active
PI3K/AKT signaling. This ﬁnding is supported by nuclear localization of a CDK2-resistant FOXO1 mutant (S249A/S298A). AKT
phosphorylation at residues T24 and S256 causes the binding of
chaperon protein 14-3-3,11 potentially masking the nuclear
localization signal and causing dissociation of FOXO1 from
DNA.18 In contrast, CDK2 phosphorylation at S249 does not
affect 14-3-3 binding16 but increases the negative charge of an
adjacent stretch of three arginines within the nuclear localization
signal,16 which was previously demonstrated to have a major role
in FOXO3 nuclear localization.33 However, CDK2-phosphorylationresistant FOXO1 is still exposed to AKT-mediated phosphorylation
thus allowing for 14-3-3-mediated destabilization of FOXO1 on
DNA. Therefore, it was not unexpected that overexpression of
CDK2-mutant FOXO1 did not reactivate EWS-FLI1-repressed
genes to the same extent as AKT-phosphorylation-resistant
FOXO1. The latter was capable of reactivating about 10% of

FOXO1 suppression in Ewing sarcoma

3936
EWS-FLI1-repressed genes as opposed to only 6% reactivated by
CDK2-resistant FOXO1. FOXO1 suppression by RNA interference
prohibited the activation of a similar number of genes by EWSFLI1 knockdown as by the AKT resistant mutant. Still, EWS-FLI1
knockdown was more efﬁcient in reactivating FOXO1 target genes
than individual phosphorylation-resistant mutants. This
difference is likely due to a so far unrecognized modulating
effect of the multiple serine-to-alanine amino-acid substitutions
on the transcriptional activity of the mutant proteins. FOXO1
was demonstrated to be involved in cellular differentiation
(reviewed in Accili and Arden34), and more speciﬁcally to
function as an early molecular regulator in the differentiation
of mesenchymal cells into osteoblasts.35 Along these lines, longterm inhibition of EWS-FLI1 enables the differentiation of ES cells
into the osteogenic lineage when treated with a suitable
differentiation cocktail.5 Thus, reactivation of FOXO1 may
represent an appropriate tool to induce differentiation in ES.
Consistent with FOXO1-driven regulation of proliferation via
induction of cell-cycle arrest,36 our in vitro assays revealed
reduced proliferative and clonogenic ability of ES cells upon
restoration of nuclear FOXO1, suggesting that FOXO1
suppression has an important role in ES oncogenesis.
We therefore hypothesized that reactivation of endogenous
FOXO1 in the presence of EWS-FLI1 may constitute a potentially
promising therapeutic strategy for ES. As a proof of principle, we
chose to interrogate a small molecule, MSA, for its activity in ES
cells in vitro and in vivo.
We found that ES cell lines were highly sensitive to MSA
treatment. MSA was previously shown to be involved in the
induction of apoptosis by different mechanisms.37,38 We here
demonstrate that cell death induction in ES was at least partially
dependent on MSA-induced FOXO1 activity. We also observed
antitumor activity in an orthotopic ES xenograft model which was
accompanied by elevated FOXO1 protein levels consistent with
our hypothesis that FOXO1 activation downstream of EWS-FLI1
confers a therapeutic beneﬁt. However, the mechanism of FOXO1
reactivation by MSA remains elusive. MSA was demonstrated
to reduce insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor levels and,
consequently, phospho-AKT levels in a mouse mammary hyperplastic epithelial cell-line39 providing a possible explanation
for the post-translational FOXO1-inducing activity of the drug.
A study in prostate cancer cells revealed that MSA treatment
results in decreased expression of genes involved in metabolism,
angiogenesis, certain transcription factors and, interestingly, signal
transduction (ERK and AKT), which was signiﬁcantly higher in
tumor cells than in non-tumor cells.40
High selenium doses are often associated with intoxication, and
the MSA concentration used in this study (2.5 mg/kg) represents
the highest tolerated dose in severe combined immune deﬁciency/bg mice (data not shown). For potential clinical use, we
envision the combination of low-dose methylated selenium in
combination with other standard chemotherapeutic agents, as it
was reported that MSA synergizes with conventional drugs such
as etoposide and doxorubicin, which are frequently used in the
treatment of ES.40
Taken together, our results imply that FOXO1 acts as a tumor
suppressor in ES, and identify FOXO1 reactivation as a promising
strategy for a future ES-speciﬁc therapy.

Plasmids and transfection
The pCDNA3-FLAG-FOXO1wt plasmid was a gift from Dr Guan (Department of Pharmacology, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA). The
plasmid encoding CDK2 phosphorylation-resistant Flag-FOXO1 mutant
(pCDNA3.1-FLAG-FOXO1-S249A/S298A) was obtained from H Huang and
DJ Tindall (Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Rochester,
MI, USA). pCDNA3-FLAG-FOXO1-AAA (T24A/S256A/S319A)17 and pECEFLAG-FOXO3 wt42 constructs were purchased from Addgene (Cambridge,
MA, USA). shRNA to CDK2 (PBS/U6shCDK2) and empty vector control (pBS/
U6 empty) constructs were provided by Dr Shi (Harvard Medical School,
Boston, MA, USA). FOXO1-targeting shRNAs (no. 1, 50 -TGACTTGGATG
GCATGTTCATTGAGCGCT-30 ; no. 3, 50 -GAAGAGCTGCATCCATGGACAACAA
CAGT-30 ) and sh-scrambled control plasmids were from OriGene
Technologies (Rockville, MD, USA). Mouse stem cell virus-based retroviral
construct mouse stem cell virus-MIGR1 expressing low levels of enhanced
green ﬂuorescent protein32 was provided by M Busslinger (Institute of
Molecular Pathology, Vienna, Austria). The plasmid encoding shRNA to
EWS-FLI1 (shEF30) has previously been described.43
Cells were transfected using the Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen,
Groningen, the Netherlands).

Immunoﬂuorescence analysis
ES cells were processed for immunoﬂuorescence analysis following
standard ﬁxation (4% paraformaldehyde) and washing steps and subsequently stained with anti-FLAG antibody (DYKDDDDK, Cell Signaling
Technology Inc., Danvers, MA, USA) and a secondary red-ﬂuorescent Alexa
Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR,
USA).

RNA preparation and reverse transcription–quantitative PCR
Total RNA was prepared with a Qiagen RNAeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany). Transcripts were quantiﬁed by TaqMan reverse transcription–
quantitative PCR using the ABI Prism 7900 Detection System (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Primers and probes used for reverse
transcription–quantitative PCR are listed in Supplementary Table S1.

Immunoblot analysis
Total proteins (30–50 mg) were resolved by 8.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and processed for immunoblotting. The following antibodies were used: FOXO3 (H-144) and CDK2 (sc-163) (Santa Cruz, CA, USA),
FOXO1 (C29H4), Phospho-FoxO1-Ser256 (9461), Phospho-FOXO3-Ser253
(9466), Lamin A/C (2032), AKT (9272) and p-AKT-Thr308 (244F9) antibodies
from Cell Signaling Technology (New England Biolabs GmbH, Frankfurt,
Germany). Antibodies to b-actin and a-Tubulin (DM1A) were from Abcam
(Cambridge, UK) and Calbiochem (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), respectively. FLI1 antibody was from MyBioSource (San Diego, CA, USA). For
preparing fractionated cell extracts, the Nuclei EZ prep nuclei isolation kit
(NUC-101, Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) and the NE-PER Nuclear and
Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA)
for fresh tumor tissue were used. Linear protein quantiﬁcation was
performed using the LICOR Odyssey Infrared Imaging System.

Microarray and in-silico motif analysis
Gene-expression proﬁling was performed using Affymetrix HG-U133PLUS2 arrays (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). Microarray data were
obtained in compliance to Minimum information about a microarray
experiment (MIAME) guidelines and submitted to Gene Expression
Omnibus accession number GSE37409. All further analyses were
performed in R statistical environment using Bioconductor packages.44
Affymetrix CEL ﬁles were preprocessed as described previously,6 yielding a
ﬁnal number of 8154 probe sets that were used for all further analyses.
Differentially expressed genes were determined using a moderated t-test
in the R package ‘limma’.45 All P-values were corrected for multiple testing
using the ‘Benjamini-Hochberg’ correction method.
Time-course analysis of gene expression in A673sh was performed on
Affymetrix HGU-133A2 arrays at ﬁve time points: 0, 18, 36, 53 and 72 h.
Each experiment was reiterated at least twice and the EWS-FLI1 protein
was found to be consistently downregulated already at 18 h in all replicate
experiments. After ﬁltering out probe sets with very low expression values
across all samples (R package ‘panp’), for every gene the most informative
probe set was selected (R package ‘geneﬁlter’) yielding 8023 genes for
further analysis. Differential expression for each gene at each later time

package ‘limma’. The resulting P-values were corrected for multiple testing
using the Benjamini-Hochberg method.

untreated groups on each day separately, a Wilcoxon signed rank test was
performed. The mixed linear model analysis and Wilcoxon tests were done
in SPPS.

Promoter analysis for binding sites of known transcription factors
Coordinates of all conserved transcription factor binding sites were
downloaded from the UCSC (University of California, Santa Cruz) genome
browser database (tfbsConsSites.txt) and hits for all sites within 1 kb
upstream of the transcription start site of all genes in the refGene.txt table
were counted (both tables were downloaded from: http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg18/database/). Subsequently, the occurrence of
each transcription factor binding sites was correlated with gene expression
change over time (all later time points vs 0 h across all genes after the EWSFLI1 knockdown). To count motifs in genes with similar time-course
dynamics, genes were ordered by their logFC and binned into 100 equally
sized bins (R package ‘dr’). Within these bins, motifs of all transcription
factor binding sites were counted and plotted against the average logFC of
the respective bin. Pearson correlation coefﬁcients between number of
motifs and mean logFC were recorded.

ES cells were seeded in triplicates at 5  104 cells/35-mm dish and
proliferation of viable cells was monitored by cell counting using a BürkerTürk chamber in combination with trypan-blue exclusion test for 4 days.

Soft agar assay
Experiments were conducted and analyzed as described previously.46

Flow cytometric analysis
For testing ES sensitivity to different concentrations of MSA a no-wash
sample preparation was used. Each cell suspension was stained for
Annexin-V using FITC Annexin-V antibody (BD Biosciences, Schwechat,
Austria). After staining, cells were acquired on a BD LSRII ﬂow cytometer.
For cell death rescue experiments using sh-FOXO1 and sh-scrambled
control, cells were co-transfected using the low-expression enhanced
green ﬂuorescent protein-Plasmid (mouse stem cell virus-MIGR1). Fortyeight hours post transfection, cells were treated or not with 5 mM MSA for
24 h and subjected to ﬂow cytometric cell-viability analysis. For data
evaluation the FlowJo software (Version 7.6.3; Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR,
USA) was used.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out using
MAGnifyTM Chromatin Immunoprecipitation System Kit (Invitrogen). For
immunoprecipitation, 15 ml of FLI1 antibody (MyBioSource, San Diego, CA,
USA) were used. PCR was performed using Phusion Hotstart II polymerase
(Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland). Primers used in 40 cycles of ampliﬁcation are
listed in Supplementary Table S2.

In vivo studies
An orthotopic xenotransplantation model using the ES cell-line SK-N-MC
was used as described in.47 Tumor formation was examined on a daily
basis and MSA treatments begun when tumors reached measurable sizes.
Two groups, consisting of 14 mice each, were either intraperitoneally
injected with 2.5 mg/kg MSA or phosphate-buffered saline and treatments
were conducted every second day for 2 weeks. Experiments were
terminated when tumors reached the critical volume of 1500 mm3. Mice
studies were approved by the state regulatory board and all animals
received humane care in compliance with the respective guidelines.

Statistical analysis of in vitro and in vivo assays
In vitro data were analyzed by the unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction
or with the one-sample t-test using the Prism 5 for Windows (version 5.02)
statistical software (GraphPad Prism Software Inc.). Data shown in graphical
format represent the means (±s.e.m.), and a P-value of o0.05 is
considered statistically signiﬁcant.
To test for overall differences in the growth curves of MSA treated vs
untreated mice, a distribution-free permutation test was utilized as
described.48 In addition, a mixed linear model analysis was performed
on log-transformed values. To test for differences between treated and
