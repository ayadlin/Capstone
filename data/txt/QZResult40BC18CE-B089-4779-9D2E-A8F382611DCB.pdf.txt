BACKGROUND: The authors investigated how the timing of administration of bevacizumab, a targeted vascular endothelial growth factor-inhibiting chemotherapeutic agent, affected the risk of wound healing in patients undergoing
chest wall port placement. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective search was performed of an institutional review board approved, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant database between 2002
and 2008, identifying 1108 port placements in patients who were treated with bevacizumab. One hundred twenty of
these ports eventually required explant. Data analyzed included patient demographics, indication for port removal,
and schedule of bevacizumab therapy. RESULTS: Wound healing complications requiring port explant were seen in
0.9% of placements (10/1108). When bevacizumab was given within 1 day of port placement, the absolute risk (AR) of
port removal for wound dehiscence was 2.4% (2/82), compared with 0.3% (3/1021) when 2 or more days had passed
between port placement and bevacizumab administration, yielding a statistically significant relative risk (RR) of 8.1 (P
< .02). Similarly, when bevacizumab was administered within 7 days of port insertion, there was a significant RR of
dehiscence-related port explant (AR 1.4% vs 0.1%, RR 11.5, P < .028). However, no significant RR for dehiscencerelated port removal was observed when bevacizumab was administered within 14 days (AR 0.9% vs 0.2%, RR 6.2, P
< .09) or 30 days (AR 0.7% vs 0.2%, RR 3.7, P < .23) of port placement. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of a wound dehiscence requiring chest wall port explant in patients treated with bevacizumab was inversely proportional to the interval between bevacizumab administration and port placement, with significantly higher risk seen when the interval is

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent promoter of neovascularization in both normal and malignant
vasculature.1 In normal tissues, VEGF plays an integral role in vascular permeability and angiogenesis,2 which are vital in
embryonic development,3 inflammation,4 and wound healing.5 In malignancy, VEGF is an important regulator of tumor-induced angiogenesis.6 Bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech, San Francisco, Calif) is a recombinant, humanized monoclonal antibody to VEGF.7 Bevacizumab is Food and Drug Administration approved for use in combination with
chemotherapy regimens in the treatment of solid tumors8: metastatic colon cancer,9 nonsmall cell lung cancer,10 and metastatic breast cancer.11 Toxicities to bevacizumab therapy include gastrointestinal perforation, hemorrhage, thromboembolic events, hypertension, proteinuria, and wound healing complications.12,13 Bevacizumab is administered
intravenously every 2 weeks, due to its long half-life of 21 days.14
Chemotherapeutic agents are typically administered through an implanted chest wall port15 to minimize venous
sclerosis from chemotherapy and to maximize patient comfort. Whether placed surgically or with radiologic guidance,
port placement requires a 2- to 3-cm incisional wound to accommodate the port reservoir. Wound healing complication
rates are low after image guided port placement by interventional radiologists, ranging from 0.9%16 to 1.3%.17 However,
inhibition of VEGF by bevacizumab in the treatment of malignancy could also reduce VEGF-mediated angiogenesis

MATERIALS AND METHODS
A waiver of authorization was obtained from our institutional review board for this retrospective study. The database used for this review was registered and approved by
our institutional review board in compliance with the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.
Patient and Disease Characteristics
We retrospectively reviewed data from patients who
underwent chest wall port placement by an interventional
radiologist at our institution and received prior, concurrent, or subsequent administration of bevacizumab

between May 2002 and April 2008. Demographics for
patients undergoing port explant are shown in Table 1.
We defined a wound healing complication as dehiscence
of port reservoir or venotomy incision, erosion of skin
over the port reservoir, or nonhealing access needle puncture site.
Chest Wall Port Placement
Chest wall port placement was performed by an experienced, fellowship-trained interventional radiologist.
Briefly, ultrasound guidance was used to access a central
vessel (typically an internal jugular vein), and a guidewire
was placed into the inferior vena cava. A 2- to 3-cm incision was made over the chest wall to accommodate the
port reservoir (Bard, Murray Hill, NJ; single or double
lumen). The port catheter was tunneled from the chest
wall site to the venotomy, and the catheter was placed into
the right atrium through a peel away sheath. In patients

whose port would be used the same day, the incision was
closed with 4-0 Dexon (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ), followed by a running subcuticular closure, and Steri-Strips
(3M, St. Paul, Minn). In the remaining patients who
would receive treatment on a subsequent day, the incision
was closed in layers with 4-0 Dexon, followed by Dermabond (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ), and Steri-Strips. Prophylactic antibiotics (1 gm of Cefazolin intravenously) were
only given to patients whose absolute neutrophil count
was less than 1000 before the procedure.
Data Analysis
To determine the effect of timing of bevacizumab administration on wound healing complications, we calculated
the total length of time of port placement and total length
of time of bevacizumab therapy, as well as the time interval between port placement and administration of bevacizumab for all patients, those who experienced wound
healing complication, and those who did not experience
wound healing complications (Table 1). The group of
patients who experienced would healing complication was
compared with the group who did not using 2-sided t tests
and chi-square tests. To minimize underlying biochemical
differences between these groups of patients, we calculated
the mean serum levels of biochemical markers that could
affect or be related to wound healing capacity: albumin
(nutritional status), international normalized ratio (INR,
liver synthetic function), blood glucose (diabetes), and
absolute neutrophil count (infection fighting capacity).
We also calculated the relative risk of wound dehiscence

1298

requiring port explant for patients who underwent port
placement within 1, 7, 14, and 30 days of bevacizumab
administration (Table 3). Confidence intervals and P values were calculated according to the method described by
Morris and Gardner.18

RESULTS
During the 72-month period, 1059 patients on or to be
treated with bevacizumab underwent 1108 port placements: 1014 patients with 1 port placed, 41 patients with
2 ports placed, 4 patients with 3 ports placed. One hundred twenty of the 1108 ports were subsequently
removed. Ten of 1108 (0.9%) ports were removed
because of a wound healing complication. Other indications for port removal include completion of therapy (n ¼
76, 7%), infection without wound healing complication
(n ¼ 26, 3%), pain (n ¼ 3, 0.3%), fever (n ¼ 2, 0.2%),
and port malfunction (n ¼ 2, 0.2%). There was no significant difference in the distribution of age, gender, race, or
primary malignancy of patients who experience wound
healing complications when compared with those
who did not experience wound healing complications
(Table 1).
There was no significant difference in the proportions of patients who received bevacizumab before, during, or after port placement when comparing the group of
patients who experienced wound complications to the
group that did not (P < .75). For example, 80% (8/10) of
patients with wound healing complications began

bevacizumab therapy after port placement compared to
84% (92/110) in patients without wound healing complications. There were no significant differences in serum
levels of albumin, INR, glucose, or absolute neutrophil
count (ANC) between patients who experienced wound
healing complications and those who did not.
Patients who experienced wound healing complications had a shorter duration of port implantation than
patients who did not (216  223 days vs 431  342 days,
P < .02). In addition, there was a significantly shorter
time interval between port placement and bevacizumab
administration in patients who experienced wound healing complications compared to those who did not (55 
96 days vs 262  369 days, P < .001). However, there
was no significant difference in the total length of bevacizumab therapy between patients who experienced wound
healing complications compared to those who did not
(214  171 days vs 300  328 days, P < .19). We
observed 5 cases of incisional wound dehiscence, 2 cases
of a nonhealing puncture site, and 3 cases of erosion over
the port reservoir (Table 2). There was a trend toward
shorter interval between port insertion and bevacizumab
therapy for patients who experienced wound dehiscence
(10  16 days) versus those who experienced nonhealing
puncture sites (91  127 days) or erosions over the reservoir (104  151 days), although this difference did not
reach significance (P < .19).
To determine the degree to which the interval
between port insertion and bevacizumab therapy affects
the risk of wound dehiscence requiring port explants, we
calculated the absolute risk (AR) and relative risk (RR) of
wound dehiscence when the interval between port placement and bevacizumab therapy was less than 1, 7, 14, and
30 days (Table 3). When bevacizumab was given within 1
day of port placement, the absolute risk of port removal

for a wound dehiscence was 2.4% (2 of 82). This was
higher than the 0.7% (3 of 1021) absolute risk when 2 or
more days had passed between port placement and bevacizumab administration, yielding a statistically significant
relative risk of 8.1 (P < .02). Similarly, when bevacizumab was administered within 7 days of port insertion,
there was a significant relative risk of port explant for
wound dehiscence (AR, 1.4% vs 0.5%; RR, 11.5; P <
.028). However, no significant relative risk was observed
for dehiscence-related port removal when bevacizumab
was administered within 14 days (AR, 0.9% vs 0.2%; RR,
6.2; P < .09) or 30 days (AR, 0.7% vs 0.2%; RR, 3.7; P <
.23) of port placement.

DISCUSSION
Wound healing complications with bevacizumab therapy
were first recognized during the pivotal phase III trial of
bevacizumab, which was conducted on 813 previously
untreated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.9 The
control arm consisted of patients who received irinotecan,
5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and leukovorin (LV), while the
treatment arm added bevacizumab as targeted therapy. In
patients who underwent surgery after beginning study
treatment, 15% (6/39) of patients in the treatment arm
experienced wound healing/bleeding complications compared with 4% (1/25) in the control arm.19 To investigate
how the interval between bevacizumab therapy and surgery affects the risk of wound healing complication, Scappaticci et al performed a meta-analysis20 which included
patients from the pivotal phase III trial, as well as patients
from a trial comparing 5-FU/LV with or without bevacizumab.21 In patients who underwent surgery after beginning study treatment, 3.4% (1/29) experienced wound
healing complications in the chemotherapy alone arm

1299

Original Article

compared to 13% (10/75) of patients in the bevacizumab
þ chemotherapy arm, however, this difference did not
reach significance (P < .28). Of these 10 patients who
experienced wound healing complication after surgery
with bevacizumab þ chemotherapy, the time interval
between bevacizumab and surgery were 5 patients within
0-29 days, 5 patients within 30 to 59 days, and 0 patients
greater than 60 days. D’Angelica et al22 also found no significant difference in postoperative complications with
patients who were treated with bevacizumab an average of
6.9 weeks prior or 7.4 weeks after surgery when compared
with a group of matched historical controls. Currently,
the precise timing to hold bevacizumab prior to and/or after surgery to avoid postoperative wound healing complications is not clear,23 but an interval of at least 5 weeks24
and up to 8 weeks25,26 has been suggested.
The half-life of bevacizumab is 21 days, and with a
typical clinical dose of bevacizumab of 5 mg/kg, VEGF
concentrations can be reduced to undetectable levels in serum at doses as low as 0.3 mg/kg.14 This suggests that
VEGF inhibition after bevacizumab therapy may be present for more than 4 half-lives (84 days, 12 weeks).27 However, wound healing angiogenesis mediated by VEGF
produced by stimulated macrophages takes place between
4 and 14 days postincision.28 Therefore, despite the
potentially long acting effect of bevacizumab, the most
important period for VEGF inhibition by bevacizumab
that could result in poor wound healing and dehiscence
should be within the first 2 weeks after the incision. Postoperative status, systemic chemotherapy, low serum albumin, or other factors relating to the patient’s overall status
might increase the time required for the completion of
wound healing angiogenesis to greater than 14 days. Typically, patients undergoing chest wall port placement have
a near normal physical status, which is better than the clinical status of patients in a postoperative state. Thus, it is
not surprising that in our study we identified an increased
risk of wound healing complications in patients when bevacizumab was administered within 14 days of port placement, while studies of surgical patients (see previous
paragraph) showed wound healing complications up to
60 days after surgery. Our results correlate well with the
work of Zawacki et al, who found that patients receiving
bevacizumab within 10 days of port placement had a
higher incidence of wound dehiscence.29
In addition to wound dehiscence, we also observed a
high number of puncture site wounds and erosions which
may be related to bevacizumab therapy. Although puncture site wounds and erosions have a different mechanism

1300

of injury than surgical incisions, angiogenesis likely plays
a role in wound repair in both of these classes of repetitive
traumas. Thus, we anticipate that both nonhealing puncture site wounds and skin erosions over the port site would
be seen at higher rates in patients treated with bevacizumab than in patients treated with other chemotherapies.
Our study has several limitations. First, because wound
healing complications after chest port placement occurs
infrequently, the small sample size of the study makes it difficult to determine the exact cutoff for the interval at which
bevacizumab administration increases the risk of wound
healing complication after mediport placement. There is a
potential selection bias, because we only evaluated wound
healing complications in patients who eventually required
port explant. It is possible there is a small subset of patients
for which a wound healing complication occurred but port
explant was not necessary. Our study is also limited by its retrospective nature, which surveyed port placements and
removals over a 6-year period.
In conclusion, the risk of a wound dehiscence
requiring chest wall port explant in patients treated with
bevacizumab is inversely proportional to the interval
between bevacizumab administration and port placement,
with significantly higher risk seen when the interval is less
than 14 days. These data suggest that those patients on or
beginning typical biweekly bevacizumab therapy who
require chest wall port placement may benefit from skipping a cycle, or delaying the onset of therapy at least 14
days after port placement, to reduce the risk of subsequent
wound dehiscence.
