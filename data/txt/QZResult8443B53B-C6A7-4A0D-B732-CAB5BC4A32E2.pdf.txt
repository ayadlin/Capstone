Abstract
Molecular therapeutics identifies an aberration in tumors to
select patients that benefit from molecular targeted therapy.
Overexpression of eIF4E in histologically ‘‘tumor-free’’ surgical
margins of head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC)
patients is an independent predictor of recurrence and is
functionally activated through the Akt/mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Although mTOR inhibitors are
cytostatic agents, best used in combination therapy, we
hypothesize that they can be used as long-term single agents
in an HNSCC model of minimal residual disease (MRD). CCI779, an mTOR inhibitor, arrested growth of a phosphatase and
tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) abnormal HNSCC cell line FaDu, inhibiting phosphorylation of 4Ebinding protein 1, resulting in increased association with
eIF4E and inhibition of basic fibroblast growth factor and
vascular endothelial growth factor. Fluorescence in situ
hybridization detected PTEN abnormalities in 68% of patient
tumors and 35% of tumor-free margins. CCI-779 inhibited
growth of established tumors in nude mice. However, in the
MRD model, there were significant differences in the tumorfree rate between the control (4%) and the treatment group
(50%), and the median tumor-free time was 7 versus 18 days,
respectively (P < 0.0001). In those animals that formed tumors,
CCI-779 caused a significant decrease in the tumor volume.
The Kaplan-Meier curve showed that CCI-779 significantly
increased survival (P < 0.0001). The mTOR pathway was
inhibited in peripheral blood mononuclear cells potential
surrogate markers of response to therapy. Stable transfection
of FaDu with luciferase allowed us to monitor the effects of
CCI-779 with bioluminescence imaging in the MRD model.
These results pave the way for a clinical trial using targeted
molecular therapy with CCI-779 as a single agent for mTORactivated residual cells. [Cancer Res 2007;67(5):2160–8]

Introduction
There has been no change in survival of head and neck
squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) patients over the last few decades
despite advances in treatment (1). One strategy to improve survival
is to identify particular cohorts of patients who might more
effectively respond to a given treatment. To this end, we have found

that overexpression of the translation initiation factor eIF4E in
histologically ‘‘tumor-free’’ surgical margins of HNSCC is an
independent predictor of recurrence (2). The overexpression of
eIF4E seems to be functionally activated in the tumor margins
through the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway,
suggesting the importance of this pathway in tumor cell survival
and recurrence (3).
An important consequence of eIF4E overexpression is the
increased translation of mRNAs with highly structured 5¶untranslated regions (UTR), many of which encode growthpromoting proteins directly related to tumorigenesis, such as
c-myc, cyclin D1, ornithine decarboxylase, basic fibroblast growth
factor (b-FGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF;
ref. 4). However, high levels of eIF4E alone are not capable of
increasing translation of these proteins because eIF4E can be
sequestered by binding to 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1). Increased
levels of functionally active eIF4E are achieved by activation of
mTOR, which leads to the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 releasing
bound eIF4E, which can then stimulate cap-dependent translation
especially of mRNAs with long 5¶-UTRs (5). mTOR is an evolutionary conserved serine/threonine kinase that regulates cell growth
and division by integrating signals from both nutrients and growth
factors (6). Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 can be inhibited by
rapamycin through its action on mTOR, thus decreasing the
available functionally active eIF4E (7, 8). Hence, it is attractive to
hypothesize that mTOR inhibitors, such as rapamycin and its
analogues, could be used as adjuvant long-term therapy in HNSCC
patients that have activation of eIF4E in the margins leading to
increased survival of this patient cohort.
Rapamycin analogues have been shown to cause a significant
inhibition of tumor growth rather than tumor regression in
experiments with tumor xenografts (9, 10). Hence, these drugs
have been used in multiple clinical trials in combination therapy
when treating established tumors (11). However, this class of
compounds also represents an attractive single-agent long-term
therapy for the inhibition of tumor regrowth following surgery in
the patient cohort expressing high levels of eIF4E in otherwise
histologically negative margins. Similar adjuvant therapy after
initial tumor treatment has been used with both hormonal therapy
and small-molecule inhibitors, such as imatinib, in a variety of
cancers (12, 13). The mTOR inhibitor Sirolimus, which has been
used to inhibit rejection in renal transplantation and to inhibit
restenosis after coronary angioplasty, has a well-established safety
profile that would allow for ready adaption as adjuvant therapy in
HNSCC patients with a high risk of recurrence (14, 15).
Additionally, previous studies have shown that sensitivity to
rapamycin is dependent on dysregulation of the tumor suppressor
gene, phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10

(PTEN) in tumors (16). mTOR functions downstream of the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway and is activated
in response to stimuli that activate the PI3K/Akt pathway. The
PI3K pathway itself represents a major cell survival pathway and is
often activated in cancer and contributes to cell cycle progression,
to decrease apoptosis, and to increase metastatic capabilities of
cancer cells (17). Normally, the phosphatase PTEN counters the
PI3K activity and thus negatively regulates PI3K/Akt survival
pathway (18). However, PTEN located on 10q23 is mutated in a
wide range of human cancers with a frequency comparable with
that of p53. Thus, dysregulation of PTEN could result in the
activation of PI3K, which in turn would lead to activation of Akt/
mTOR, further supporting the use of the rapamycin class of
inhibitors as adjuvant therapy in HNSCC patients.
Therefore, in investigating the efficacy of rapamycin analogues in
preventing recurrence, we first determined whether PTEN ploidy
was abnormal in HNSCC tumors and then tested whether the
rapamycin analogue CCI-779 was capable of inhibiting growth of a
PTEN abnormal HNSCC cell line in culture and in xenograft models
through inactivation of mTOR. In the xenograft models, the activity
of the mTOR pathway in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC) was monitored as a potential surrogate marker of tumor
response. These studies present a novel approach for the potential
use of a small-molecule inhibitor that specifically targets cells with
a specific molecular aberration.

Materials and Methods
Cell line and generation of luciferase-expressing FaDu cells. The
eIF4E-overexpressing HNSCC cell line FaDu derived from a hypopharyngeal
SCC (obtained from American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) was
grown in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), supplemented
with 10% bovine calf serum, nonessential amino acids (Life Technologies),
and 100 units of penicillin with 100 Ag streptomycin. Cells were grown in
monolayers and maintained in humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37j C. All
chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) except for
CCI-779, which was provided by Wyeth-Ayerst Research (Philadelphia, PA).
To be able to image tumor cells in nude mice, FaDu cells were transfected
with a luciferase-expressing vector (pMS110), a generous gift from Message
Pharmaceuticals (Malvern, PA), using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen).
Transfected cells were selected with 500 Ag/mL G418, and individual clones
were analyzed for luciferase expression by plating in a 96-well plate and,
24 h later, by lysing the cells and analyzing luciferase activity in a Victor III
plate reader (Perkin-Elmer, Elm Grove IL). FaDu9000 was the clone that
expressed the highest level of active luciferase following transfection of
pMS110.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization for PTEN in cell lines and
paraffin-embedded tissue. Gene copy number was assayed by a
multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). A commercial DNA
probe (Vysis/Abbott, Des Plains, IL) 10q23/PTEN was used with a PTEN
gene probe labeled with Spectrum Orange and a centromeric enumeration
probe for chromosome 10 labeled with Spectrum Green. Cytospin
preparations of FaDu cells were fixed in 3:1 methanol/acetic acid and
processed for hybridization with the select probes. Target DNA and probe
were codenatured, hybridized overnight, washed serially in decreasing
concentrations of detergent wash solutions (sodium chloride and sodium
citrate), and counterstained with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The
slides were visualized using a Leica (Wetzlar, Germany) DMRB fluorescent
microscope equipped with a rhodamine/FITC/DAPI triple band pass filter
and imaged with a FISH imaging system (Cytovision, Applied Imaging, Inc.,
San Jose, CA). FISH analysis of paraffin-embedded tissue sections was
carried out by the Molecular Pathology Laboratory using a well-established
protocol (19). Approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board.
Proliferation assay determining effects of CCI-779 on FaDu and
FaDu9000. The effects of CCI-779 on the proliferation of FaDu and

www.aacrjournals.org

FaDu9000 cells were determined by plating exponentially growing cells in
96-well plates (3,000 per well) and medium with various concentrations of
CCI-779 (0–10,000 ng/mL) for time points ranging from 0 to 96 h. Cell
proliferation was measured with the 3-(4-5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium salt/phenazine
methosulfate (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) system using a previously
established proliferation assay (20). The dose effects were calculated as a
percentage of the cell growth obtained from vehicle-treated cells grown in
the same culture plate for the same time point. In addition, the effects of
10 nmol/L rapamycin on luciferase activity in these cells were monitored
using the Steady-Glow Luciferase kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with detection of activity using the Lucy II (Rosys
Anthos, New Castle, DE) luminometer.
In vivo established tumor HNSCC xenograft models. In the
established tumor model, BALB/c nu/nu mice (Charles River Laboratories,
Wilmington, MA) were injected s.c. with 1  106 FaDu cells. Animals were
maintained in a barrier facility in accordance with Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee regulations. Tumor volume [(length  width2) / 2] was
determined with a digital caliper. On day 0, defined as average tumor
volumes for the groups of approximately 60 to 90 mm3, animals were
randomized into five groups of five mice each and treated with vehicle or
CCI-779 prepared in 4% ethanol, 5.2% Tween 80, and 5.2% polyethylene
glycol 400 (Sigma-Aldrich) at a daily i.p dose of 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg for
3 weeks (5 days/wk). The doses were based on studies with CCI-779 on
colon carcinoma cell lines (21). Tumor volumes were measured on days 7,
14, and 21 (three cycles). Because tumor volume was determined serially in
each mouse, a two-way repeated measures ANOVA was done, and when the
overall dose and time effects were significant, pairwise comparisons among
the five dosage groups and the four time points were done using the
Bonferroni post hoc test to control at 5% the overall level of significance.
As a surrogate marker of toxicity, body weight was measured weekly for
the duration of the experiment at the time of tumor measurement without
any differences observed between treated and control animals (data not
shown).
Minimal residual disease model to measure the effects of CCI-779.
This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and potential therapeutic
role of CCI-779 in a minimal residual disease (MRD) model that intends to
mimic patients with molecular positive margins (22). Nude mice were
anesthetized and incisions were made in the dorsal flanks and s.c. flaps
were elevated with sharp dissection. Pipette dispensers were used to
introduce the tumor cells (2  106 FaDu cells) in 100 AL of culture medium
into the flap, which was then sutured. Instead of allowing the tumor cells to
form nodules, 72 h following tumor seeding, the animals were randomized
into five groups of eight mice each and treated with vehicle or CCI-779 at
daily i.p doses of 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg for 3 weeks as in the established
tumor model and tumor volume was determined. In this manner, although
no gross tumors were present, microscopic tumor cells were present within
the surgical site mimicking the clinical dilemma of surgical excision of all
gross tumor but leaving positive margins. Blood (500 AL) was obtained by
orbital bleeding, and aliquots of PBMCs were collected using Histopaque1083 at baseline and 72 h after treatment was completed to analyze the
mTOR pathway (see below). The five groups were compared on proportion
of mice that developed tumors and on average volume of tumor developed.
Logistic regression analysis with tumor development as the dependent
variable and group as the independent variable was used to determine
significant effect of group on tumor development. When the effect of group
on tumor development indicated an overall significant difference among the
five groups, pairwise comparisons among the five groups were done using
the Fisher exact test to determine which pairwise difference contributed to
the overall significant difference. Because of the observed nonnormality of
tumor volume in the drug dosage groups and significantly different
variability among the groups, a nonparametric ANOVA, the Kruskal-Wallis
test, was used to determine significant differences among the five groups.
When an overall significant difference was indicated by the test, pairwise
comparisons among the five groups were done using the Wilcoxon ranksum test to determine which pairwise difference contributed to the overall
significant difference.

Cancer Research
The results of the initial experiment with the MRD model were used to
determine the sample size for a definitive study with a single strength of
CCI-779 (20 mg/kg) to determine if CCI-779 could prevent tumor formation
in a model of MRD. The 20 mg/kg dose was chosen as there was a dose

response in preventing tumor formation in the previous experiment. In the
definitive study to confirm that CCI-779 had a significant effect on tumor
development, MRD was established with 25 mice randomly assigned to a
control group and 43 to receive CCI-779. The mice were sacrificed at day 21
to measure tumor volume with PBMCs also being obtained.
The Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test were used to estimate
and compare the two groups on tumor-free rate and median tumor-free
times.
Survival study. A survival study using the MRD model was undertaken
to determine the time to form tumors of f200 mm3 after cessation of CCI779 treatment. In this experiment, 24 mice were treated with 20 mg/kg CCI779 for 21 days and 16 control mice received vehicle alone. The control mice
were sacrificed at day 21, as their tumors were already >200 mm3. The
treated mice were followed until the tumors were f200 mm3 in size or up
to 30 days after the drug was discontinued for those animals that did not
develop tumors.
In vivo imaging of tumor growth in a model of MRD by
bioluminescence. The MRD model was established with FaDu9000 cells
with 10 animals subsequently receiving 20 mg/kg CCI-779 and 10 animals
receiving vehicle alone. Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) was used to
measure luciferase activity with In vivo Imaging System (IVIS) technology
(Xenogen, Alameda, CA) optimized for high sensitivity (23).
BLI was done twice weekly. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine
(70 mg/kg i.p.) and xylazine (5 mg/kg i.p.) followed by the injection of
luciferin (150 mg/kg i.p.; Xenogen) 10 min before imaging. Animals were
then put in the light-protected chamber of the IVIS imaging system, and
photons emitted were measured over 3 min. Regions of interest were drawn
over the area of photon emission and quantified using the ‘‘Living Image’’
software. As luciferase-bearing cells proliferated in vivo, occasional image
saturation was encountered. This was overcome by shortening exposure
time to reduce the number of photons collected.
Western blot analysis of 4E-BP1, phospho-4E-BP1, phospho-S6
kinase, and b-FGF. To determine if the observed effects of CCI-779 were a
result of mTOR inhibition, the phosphorylation status of 4E-BP1 was
analyzed in the cell lines, tumors, and PBMCs after treatment with CCI-779.
Protein was extracted directly from cells and tumor samples from the
established tumor model (f5 mg) following treatment with CCI-779, and
Western blot analysis was done according to previously published
laboratory protocol (3). The following antibodies were used: rabbit
polyclonal anti–4E-BP1 (1:500), rabbit anti-S6 kinase (1:100), rabbit anti–
phospho-S6 kinase (Ser235/236; 1:100), rabbit anti–phospho-4E-BP1 (Ser65;
1:100), and rabbit anti–FGF-2 (1:100; all antibodies were obtained from Cell
Signaling, Beverly, MA except anti–FGF-2 that was obtained from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).
VEGF ELISA assay with CCI-779 treatment on cell lines. The
translation of VEGF mRNA is dependent on eIF4E concentration. To
determine if VEGF expression was inhibited by treatment with CCI-779,
FaDu cells were seeded into six-well culture plates at a density of 4  105
per well and incubated for 24 h in medium with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS). The medium was then removed and replaced with fresh medium
containing 10% FBS with and without 1 and 10 ng/mL CCI-779. Medium
was removed at 30 min and 1, 2, 4, 6, 24, and 48 h after treatment with the
drug and vehicle, centrifuged at 800 rpm for 5 min, and then stored at
80jC. The VEGF protein concentration in the medium was determined by
ELISA using a commercial kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).

Analysis of PTEN ploidy by FISH in HNSCC. As PTEN has been
shown to influence sensitivity to rapamycin, we analyzed PTEN
copy number by FISH in the HNSCC FaDu cell line and in the
HNSCC tumors. In the FaDu cells, PTEN is aneuploid (hyperdiploid) cells with approximately three copies of the 10q23 locus
identified by FISH analysis (Fig. 1A) because both the green
centromeric marker and the orange 10q23/PTEN locus marker are
increased. PTEN ploidy was examined by FISH in 22 HNSCC tumor

samples and in 23 tumor-free margins, and the presence of
deletions and/or aneuploidy was scored. Fifteen of 22 (68%) tumors
showed abnormalities of PTEN with 8 tumors showing loss of one
allele, 5 tumors with aneuploidy of chromosome 10, and 2 tumors
containing cells either with deletions of PTEN and other cells with
hyperploidy of the PTEN locus. The remaining seven tumors
showed normal copy number of chromosome 10 and the 10q23/
PTEN locus. Figure 1B is an example of a tumor with both
deletions and aneuploidy of PTEN. Eight of the 23 (35%) margins
showed deletions of PTEN. In addition, one margin with deletions
also showed a gain of PTEN in some cells. Figure 1C is a
histologically tumor-free margin with PTEN deletions present in
the basal cell layer. Previously, overexpression of eIF4E in the basal
cell layer has been shown to predict recurrence (2).
In vitro growth-inhibitory effects of CCI-779 on FaDu and
FaDu9000. CCI-779 inhibited the growth of FaDu cells in a timeand dose-dependent manner at concentrations up to 100 ng/mL
(Fig. 2A). At higher doses, there was no further growth inhibition.
CCI-779 was found to have similar effects on the growth of
FaDu9000 cells, indicating that transfection with the luciferase
plasmid did not change the sensitivity of the cell line to CCI-779.
Treatment of FaDu9000 cells with f10 ng/mL rapamycin for 24 or
48 h did not alter luciferase activity (data not shown), showing lack
of direct effect of rapamycin on the reporter gene.
Effects of CCI-779 on 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, eIF4E/4EBP1 complex formation, and protein synthesis. Regulation of
eIF4E activity is, in part, by phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 because

phosphorylated 4E-BP1 does not bind eIF4E. CCI-779 treatment of
cells should inhibit the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 resulting in
binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E. Western blot analysis of total 4E-BP1
showed that treatment with CCI-779 led to a concentrationdependent inhibition in the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 with a
decrease of the more phosphorylated ‘g’ isoform and an increase of
the less phosphorylated ‘h’ isoform and unphosphorylated ‘a’
isoform (Fig. 2B).
The sequestration of eIF4E by 4E-BP1 should result in an
inhibition of protein synthesis, particularly the synthesis of
proteins from mRNAs with highly structured 5¶-UTRs. To test this,
we assayed two important angiogenic factors, b-FGF and VEGF,
both of which are encoded by mRNAs with highly structured 5¶UTRs. Two isoforms of b-FGF were noted due to alternative
translation initiation from the CUG and AUG start codons. There
was disappearance of the CUG isoform and decrease in the AUG
isoform within 2 to 4 h of treatment with nearly complete loss of
the AUG isoform by 48 h with 10 ng/mL CCI-779 (Fig. 2C).
Similarly, 1 and 10 ng/mL treatment with CCI-779 significantly
inhibited VEGF secretion in the medium over 48 h when compared
with the control (Fig. 2D).
In vivo effects of CCI-779. The effect of CCI-779 was next tested
in vivo on cell growth in the established xenograft tumor model
(Table 1). In this model, there were highly significant (P < 0.0001)
differences in average tumor size at days 7, 14, and 21 after
initiation of CCI-779 treatment between the four treatment groups
and the controls. There were no significant differences among the

four drug groups. Analysis of the 4E-BP1/mTOR pathway in the
established tumor model was undertaken after 21 days of
treatment with CCI-779. Treatment with CCI-779 resulted in an
inhibition in the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 from the more
phosphorylated ‘y’ and ‘g’ isoforms to the less phosphorylated ‘h’
isoform and unphosphorylated ‘a’ isoform (Fig. 3A). mTOR activity
also regulates a second pathway, S6K1, which functions as a kinase
for the phosphorylation of the 40S ribosomal protein S6. CCI-779
resulted in a significant dose-dependent decrease in phospho-S6 in
the established tumor model (Fig. 3B). These data strongly suggest
that CCI-779 inhibits tumor growth in vivo through the mTOR
pathway.

The effect of CCI-779 was next tested in the MRD model. With
increasing doses of CCI-779, there was a significant decrease in the
proportion of mice that developed tumors (P = 0.025, logistic
regression analysis; Table 2). There was also an effect of the
treatment on tumor volumes, which were decreased compared
with control analyzed either by pairwise comparisons (P = 0.003) or
by pooling all four treatment groups (P = 0.0002) with a decrease in
tumor volume from an average volume of 360.3 F 118.6 mm3 in
control mice to an average volume of 19.1 F 10.1 mm3 in the
combined four treatment groups.
In a larger definitive study with the MRD model, tumor
formation was measured at day 21 after treatment of 43 mice

CCI-779 for Microscopic Disease in Head and Neck Cancer

Analysis of CCI-779 effects on the mTOR pathway in PBMCs
of treated animals. As an intermediate marker of the effect of
CCI-779, phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was examined in PBMCs from
CCI-779–treated and control mice from the MRD model. Western
blot analysis showed that each of the four doses of CCI-779
inhibited the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 compared with control.
CCI-779 also decreased phopho-S6 in the treated group (D1)
compared with the control (C5; Fig. 4D).

with 20 mg/kg CCI-779 and compared with 25 control mice. There
were again significant differences in the tumor-free rate between
the control (4%) and the treatment group (50%). The median
tumor-free time with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) was
18 days (15–1) for the treated group and 7 days (7, 12) for the
control group (P < 0.0001). Although 50% of the treated mice
formed tumors, when the size of these tumors was analyzed, the
treatment was found to cause a significant decrease in the tumor
volume (29.0 F 32.8 mm3) compared with the control (162.5 F
134.4 mm3; P < 0.0001).
In a ‘‘survival study’’ using the MRD model, CCI-779 (20 mg/kg)
treatment was discontinued after 3 weeks and mice were followed
until tumors reached an approximate volume of 200 mm3, at which
time the animals were sacrificed (Fig. 4A). The Kaplan-Meier curve
shows that CCI-779 significantly retarded the time to develop
tumors of at least 200 mm3 (P < 0.0001). In the treatment group,
21% of the animals remained tumor-free for 30 days after treatment
was discontinued (end point of the study for those animals that did
not form tumors), at which point the animals were sacrificed. The
mean tumor-free time was 38 days (95% CI, 34–41 days) compared
with the control group where only 6% of mice remained tumor-free
and mean tumor-free time was 16 days (95% CI, 15–17 days).
In vivo BLI results in MRD model. The MRD model requires
sacrifice of animals to monitor tumor growth. Because relatively
small numbers of cells are implanted, large cohorts of animals are
needed to monitor the effects of an intervention. Hence, BLI was
used immediately after injection of FaDu9000 cells, modified to
stably express luciferase, and then twice weekly in the control mice
and mice treated with CCI-779 to measure the effects of CCI-779.
An example of serial imaging is shown for both control and treated
mouse (Fig. 4B) and shows both the similarity of cell numbers at
the beginning of the experiment, the continued increase of
bioluminescence with time, and the inhibition of luminescence
by CCI-779. In the entire group, a significant difference was first
seen by day 7 and persisted for the entire experiment with a 10-fold
difference at day 21 (Fig. 4C).

A recent editorial suggests that clinical trials of targeted
therapies should report not just the maximum tolerated dose but
also the dose that reaches the target and produces the desired
downstream effect (24). In addition, surrogate markers should be
developed to facilitate monitoring of responses. Our in vivo model
meets these requirements, mimics the design of a clinical trial, and
indicates that CCI-779 can potentially inhibit tumor formation in a
model of MRD in HNSCC. The current study is the first to test a
mTOR inhibitor in an MRD model and to show that PBMCs can
serve as a surrogate marker of response.
It has also been suggested that to select patients whose cancers
would most likely be amenable to treatment with mTOR inhibitors,
tumors should be assayed for PTEN loss, Akt activation, and mTOR
phosphorylation (11). We have identified previously a select
population of patients whose tumor-free surgical margins have
residual cells showing activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway who
might potentially benefit from treatment with mTOR inhibitors (3).
We now also report for the first time using FISH that about two
thirds of HNSCC tumors have genomic alterations of PTEN alleles.
Although the role of PTEN in HNSCC tumorigenesis is controversial, the loss of PTEN protein expression is an independent
predictor of poor outcome in tongue cancers and also correlates
with pathologic tumor stage in HNSCC (25, 26). The loss of PTEN is
more likely associated with loss of heterozygosity. The gain in the
copy of PTEN seen in some of our specimens may indicate the
aneuploid nature of the tumor cells, indicating perhaps chromosomal instability that may cause tumorigenesis and the loss and/or
gain of PTEN supports its role in HNSCC.
CCI-779 has shown antitumor activity against a broad range of
human cancers both in tissue culture and in human tumor
xenograft models (9, 21, 27). In this study, CCI-779 effectively
abrogated the downstream affects of mTOR activation in an
HNSCC cell line, decreasing expression of the translational
effectors S6K1 and 4E-BP1 and resulting in decreased expression
of b-FGF and VEGF. Furthermore, in the xenograft models, CCI-779
inhibited this pathway in the tumor cells as well as in the PBMCs of
treated animals. CCI-779 represents then a new targeted therapy
for treatment of HNSCC because mTOR is activated in the majority
of these tumors (3, 28).
The mTOR modulates two separate downstream pathways 4EBP1 and the 40S ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70 S6 kinase) that
control the translation of specific subsets of mRNAs, including
VEGF and FGF (29–31). The activation of mTOR leads to the
phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, preventing it from binding to the capbinding protein, eIF4E, which in turn leads to increased protein
synthesis. Activation of eIF4E may be necessary although not
sufficient for oncogenesis (4, 32–34). Overexpression of eIF4E in
mouse B-cell lymphoma accelerates tumorigenesis and mimics the
neoplastic effects of activated Akt in these cells (35). In HNSCC,
breast, and bladder cancers eIF4E overexpression facilitates the

synthesis of b-FGF and VEGF, both potent angiogenic factors for
tumor progression (36–38). We have shown previously that
reduction of eIF4E with antisense RNA in human FaDu HNSCC
and MDA-435 breast cancer cells suppressed the tumorigenic and
angiogenic properties of these cells, concomitant with loss of
FGF-2 synthesis (39, 40). Furthermore, rapamycin, which inhibits
mTOR activation, has also been shown to have antiangiogenic
properties by reducing the production of VEGF (41). In the present
study, we show that in vitro and in vivo CCI-779 inhibition of
growth of HNSCC is associated with inhibition of the downstream
targets of mTOR, the ribosomal S6K1 and 4E-BP1, which could lead
to the reduced production of VEGF and FGF-2. The critical role
that this pathway plays in tumorigenesis is further supported by
the observation that the primary effects of oncogenic Ras or Akt on
gene expression are via induction of mRNA translation (42).
A key aspect of the current studies was to develop a preclinical
model that would mimic the clinical situation of resection margins
that had no residual cancer cells by histologic examination but still
exhibited a molecular marker for cancer. The MRD seemed to be a
reasonable preclinical model that could be made more useful by

examining the response of cells longitudinally in the same animal.
Using FaDu cells expressing luciferase did afford us this additional
power and extends the usefulness of HNSCC to other tumor types
(43, 44). The BLI results showed a significant decrease in photon
emission in the CCI-779 treatment group compared with the
control group. However, as expected with a cytostatic agent, tumor
cells were still viable even during treatment. In the survival study,
only 21% of the treated group did not form tumors after
discontinuing the drug. Hence, patients with eIF4E overexpression
in the surgical margins may require prolonged adjuvant therapy.
The design of a clinical trial would involve the prolonged use of
mTOR inhibitors. It is known that if tumor cells remain dormant
and do not undergo the neovascularization required for tumor
growth beyond a few millimeters that the tumor cells do not
survive (45). Hence, prolonged treatment with mTOR inhibitors
could potentially lead to ultimate death of tumor cells in the
clinical setting of MRD. The intent of this study was to compare the
effects of CCI-779 in a model of MRD and show increased survival
compared with an established tumor model. Future studies are
planned to vary timing of administration of mTOR inhibitors to

determine the length of time needed to prevent tumor formation
even when the drug is discontinued. Interestingly, preclinical and
clinical studies indicate that intermittent administration of CCI779 reduces its immunosuppressive properties while retaining its
antitumor activity (46). Hence, in our preclinical model, we have
used the intermittent dose scheduling.
Fortunately, both a low dose of CCI-779 is sufficient to inhibit the
mTOR pathway, and the safety of the prolonged use of sirolimus
has been shown in renal transplant patients (47). In other cancers,
CCI-779 has shown strong antitumor potential and favorable
pharmaceutical and toxicologic characteristics in early clinical
trials with skin rash and mucositis being the prominent adverse
effects (48, 49). In the survival study, there was an efficient block in
tumor progression with this cell line during the 18 days after the
treatment window, which indicates that long-term treatment with
CCI-779 may lead to stable residual disease for as long as the
treatment is continued. If our findings accurately predict human
responses, then administration of CCI-779 would be continuous or
long-term postresection. The long-term use of CCI-779 has been
tested in a phase 3 randomized, three-arm study of temsirolimus
(CCI-779), IFN-a, or the combination of temsirolimus plus IFN in
the first-line treatment of poor-risk patients with advanced renal
cell carcinoma with some patients receiving CCI-779 for as long as
4 years with an acceptable safety profile (50). The most frequently
occurring adverse events were maculopapular rash, mucositis,
asthenia, and nausea, with the most frequently occurring grade

3 or 4 adverse events being hyperglycemia, hypophosphatemia,
anemia, and hypertriglyceridemia.
A major challenge in clinical trials using signal transduction
pathway inhibitors is to identify patients whose tumors have the
appropriate molecular make up to respond to a specific inhibitor.
A prospective trial has indicated that patients with molecular
positive eIF4E margins are at high risk for relapse (2). Because
standard adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy have significant
side effects and do not specifically target the eIF4E-positive cells,
there is a need for a novel therapeutic approach targeting this
pathway. mTOR and the associated signaling pathway represent an
attractive target for adjuvant treatment in the cohort of eIF4Epositive margin patients. Rapamycin analogues cause significant
tumor growth inhibition rather than tumor regression when tested
in vivo experiments with tumor xenografts. In the present study,
the results with the MRD model suggest that possible long-term
administration of the rapamycin analogue, CCI-779, holds promise
as a single agent in the treatment of patients with molecular
positive eIF4E margins.
