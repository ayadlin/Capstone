Abstract
Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is an aggressive malignancy with a poor outcome. Although targeting
ERBB2 with trastuzumab has been evaluated in clinical trials, the molecular mechanisms of trastuzumab
resistance remain uncharacterized in EAC. The dopamine and cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein of MR 32000
(DARPP-32), also known as PPP1R1B, is located together with ERBB2 at the 17q12-q21 amplicon. We evaluated the
expression of a transcript variant of DARPP-32 (t-DARPP) and ERBB2 in 141 primary tumors and investigated the
role of t-DARPP in trastuzumab resistance using OE19 and OE33 EAC cell models. Overexpression of t-DARPP
mRNA was detected in two-thirds of tumors with a correlation between ERBB2 and t-DARPP overexpression levels
(r ¼ 0.58, P ¼ 0.003). Cell viability and clonogenic survival assays showed that t-DARPP increased survival by 40%
in response to trastuzumab (P < 0.01). The Annexin-V staining and Western blot analysis indicated that t-DARPP
effectively abrogated trastuzumab-induced apoptosis, inhibited cleavage of caspase-3, and blocked trastuzumabinduced dephosphorylation of ERBB2 and AKT proteins. The knockdown of endogenous t-DARPP reversed these
effects and sensitized cells to trastuzumab (P < 0.01). The cycloheximide-based protein degradation analysis
indicated that t-DARPP extended the half-life of ERBB2, explaining the increase in the basal levels of ERBB2, pERBB2(Y1248), and p-AKT(S473). Coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis showed that t-DARPP
associated with ERBB2 in a protein complex, and interfered with trastuzumab binding to the ERBB2 receptor.
Using EAC-xenografted mouse model, t-DARPP enhanced tumor growth and rendered tumors unresponsive to
trastuzumab. This study establishes t-DARPP as a mediator of trastuzumab resistance and underscores its
potential importance in clinical trials of EAC. Cancer Res; 72(17); 4504–14. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Esophageal carcinoma is the sixth most common cause of
cancer-related death worldwide (1). Histologically, esophageal
cancer can be divided into adenocarcinoma and squamous cell
carcinoma. The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma
(EAC) has been rising rapidly in the past 3 decades (2, 3).
There are approximately 14,000 cases of esophageal cancer per
year in the United States, of which most are EAC (4, 5). The
overall 5-year survival rate of EAC is less than 15% (4–7),
indicating that current treatment regimens are ineffective.
Chromosomal ampliﬁcation at the 17q21 region is a frequent ﬁnding in adenocarcinomas of the stomach and esophagus (8, 9). This region is a gene-rich area that contains several

candidate cancer genes (9). The ERBB2 locus, within the 17q12q21 amplicon, has been heavily implicated in several malignancies. ERBB2 is ampliﬁed and overexpressed in approximately 15% to 25% of EAC tumor specimens and has been
implicated in the pathogenesis of EAC (10–12). In addition to
ERBB2, the amplicon region contains several other genes such
as DARPP-32 [also known as protein phosphatase 1 regulatory
subunit 1B (PPP1R1B)], GRB7, and TOP2A. Recently, DARPP-32
and its cancer-speciﬁc truncated variant (t-DARPP) have been
mapped to the ERBB2 amplicon (8). t-DARPP is overexpressed
in several malignancies, such as those of the stomach, colon,
breast, and prostate (13–15). We and other researchers have
shown that the t-DARPP protein promotes cell growth, survival, and drug resistance through activation of AKT signaling
in cancer cells (14, 16–18).
The ERBB2 gene-targeted therapy continues to be applied in
several clinical trials; Trastuzumab (Herceptin), a humanized
monoclonal anti-ERBB2 antibody, was ﬁrst used for the treatment of ERBB2-overexpressing advanced metastatic breast
cancers (19). To date, most of our understanding of ERBB2targted therapy comes from studies in breast cancer. Although
ERBB2-positive tumors initially respond to trastuzumab treatment, the majority of responders progress within 12 months of
initiating therapy as a result of acquired trastuzumab resistance (20). Several studies have elucidated some of the

t-DARPP Mediates Trastuzumab Resistance

mechanisms of trastuzumab resistance using in vitro cell
models. This resistance has been attributed to disruption of
interaction between ERBB2 and trastuzumab by MUC4 expression (21), compensatory signaling by other ERBB receptor
members (22), compensatory signaling from other types of
receptors such as insulin-like growth factor type 1 (IGF-IR; ref.
23), increased circulating ERBB2 ECD (24), and altered downstream signaling, including PTEN deﬁciency (25), increased
AKT activity (26), and downregulation of P27 (CDKN1B; ref. 27).
Trastuzumab, in combination with cisplatin, has been
recently used in clinical trials to treat patients with ERBB2positive metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (28). Notably, a phase 3 clinical trial (RTOG 1010
protocol) is currently ongoing to evaluate the addition of
trastuzumab to increase disease-free survival when combined
with trimodality treatment (radiation plus chemotherapy followed by surgery) for EAC patients. Therefore, it is crucial to
characterize novel mechanisms of trastuzumab resistance in
EAC because our capabilities to identify, overcome, or clinically
manage this resistant phenotype in EAC are currently limited.
In this study, we elucidated a novel mechanism by which tDARPP mediates trastuzumab resistance in EAC. We showed
that t-DARPP binds and stabilizes the ERBB2 protein, thereby
activating the AKT signaling and promoting trastuzumab
resistance by interfering with trastuzumab interaction with
the ERBB2 receptor.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
The human esophageal adenocarcinoma cancer cell lines,
OE19 and OE33, were obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (Sigma-Aldrich) and the American Type Culture Collection, respectively. To generate
trastuzumab-resistant clones, OE19 cells were cultured
with increasing concentrations of trastuzumab for more
than 6 months in vitro, and the resistant cells were maintained with 20 mg/mL trastuzumab in culture. Cycloheximide was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. ERBB2, AKT,
p-AKT(S473), caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, and b-actin antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology.
DARPP-32 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and the p-ERBB2(Y1248) antibody was obtained
from Abcam. Trastuzumab was purchased from the Vanderbilt University Hospital Pharmacy.
t-DARPP expression and small-interfering RNA
To generate stable expression cells, the ﬂag-tagged coding
sequence of t-DARPP was ampliﬁed and cloned into pcDNA3
mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). OE19 cells stably
expressing t-DARPP or pcDNA3 empty vector were generated
in accordance with standard protocols as described previously
(16). Flag-tagged t-DARPP coding sequence was ampliﬁed and
cloned into the adenoviral shuttle vector (pACCMV), and the
recombinant adenovirus was generated by cotransfecting
HEK-293 cells with the shuttle and backbone adenoviral
(pJM17) plasmids using the Calcium Phosphate Transfection
Kit (Applied Biological Materials Inc., Richmond, BC). Control

siRNA (sc-37007) and t-DARPP siRNA (sc-35173; a cocktail of
3 different oligonucleotides) was obtained from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology.
Cell viability assays
The CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) was conducted according to supplier instructions. Briefly, cells (5  103 per well) were seeded onto a 96-well plate.
Approximately 18 hours after seeding, cells were treated with
trastuzumab (20 mg/mL) for 48 hours. The luminescence was
read on a Microplate Reader (FLUOstar OPTIMA). For trypan
blue dye exclusion assay, viable cells for each concentration
were counted on a hemocytometer after trypsinization. All
experiments were carried out in triplicate and repeated 3 times.
Clonogenic survival assay
Cells were trypsinized and harvested in single-cell suspension. Cells were plated at low-density (2  103 cells per well) in
6-well plates. The following day, cells were treated with vehicle
or 20 mg/mL trastuzumab. Culture media were replaced every
3 days with the addition of vehicle or fresh trastuzumab. After
culturing for 2 weeks, cells were ﬁxed with methanol:acetic
acid (3:1, vol:vol) and stained with 1% crystal violet. Colonies
with 50 cells were counted.
Apoptosis assay
OE19 cells infected with control (10 MOI) or t-DARPP (10
MOI) recombinant adenoviruses, and parental or trastuzumab-resistant OE19 cells were seeded onto 60 mm culture
plates. The next day, cells were treated with trastuzumab
(20 mg/mL) or vehicle for 48 hours. Cells were then collected
and stained with Annexin-V ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate and
propidium iodide (PI; R&D Systems). The samples were
washed with PBS and re-suspended in binding buffer (2 mL
HEPES buffered saline solution supplemented with 2.5 mmol/L
CaCl2), and then subjected to ﬂuorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS) analysis (Becton Dickinson).
Cycloheximide-based ERBB2 protein stability assay
Cells (2  105 cells per well) were seeded into 12-well plates.
The next day, cells were treated with 80 mg/ml of cycloheximide (CHX) and harvested at different time points. Proteins
were extracted and analyzed by Western blotting to assess
ERBB2 protein stability. The intensities of protein bands
were semiquantitatively analyzed by densitometry using
ImageJ software (NIH Image). ERBB2 band intensities for
each treatment condition were normalized to b-actin. The
protein degradation curve was generated by plotting band
intensities ratios as a function of the time period of CHX
treatment. Linear regression was carried out, and the protein
half-life (t1/2), which is expressed as the time for degradation
of 50% of the protein, was calculated from the ﬁtted line
equation (29).
Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR
Frozen de-identiﬁed human tissue samples were obtained
from the archives of pathology at Vanderbilt University and the
National Cancer Institute Cooperative Human Tissue Network.

The use of coded specimens was approved by the Institutional
Review Board at the Vanderbilt University. The samples included 141 adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and stomach and 51
nontumor normal mucosae samples. Histopathological diagnosis was veriﬁed based on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)stained sections. The adenocarcinomas ranged from welldifferentiated to poorly differentiated, stages II to IV, with a
mix of intestinal- and diffuse-type tumors. Total RNA was
isolated from cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Singlestranded cDNA was synthesized from 1 mg total RNA by an
iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Primers for ERBB2, tDARPP, and HPRT1 were designed, and the results were
normalized to HPRT1 as a stable reference gene for quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). All primers
were purchased from IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.).
The quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was carried out in an iCycler (Bio-Rad), with the threshold
cycle number was determined by iCycler software version 3.0.
The relative mRNA expression levels were calculated according
to the formula 2(RT-ET)/2(Rn-En), as described previously (30).
Western blot analysis
Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer (50
mmol/L Tris–HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton
X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) supplemented
with 1 Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail and 1 Halt Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Pierce). Protein concentrations
were determined with the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad).
Proteins were separated on 10% to 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Protran nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman). Membranes were probed with speciﬁc primary antibodies, and
horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Cell
Signaling). Bands were visualized using a commercial Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase
(HRP) Substrate kit (Millipore).
Immunoprecipitation
Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and solubilized
for 30 minutes at 4 C with lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100)
containing 1% Halt protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc). The cell lysates were ﬁrst sonicated and then spun
down at 15,000 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatants were
collected and protein concentration was measured by the BioRad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Total protein (200 mg) was
incubated with 1 mg trastuzumab or anti-M2-ﬂag antibodies
overnight at 4 C on a rotating platform followed by incubation
with 50 mL Dynabeads Protein G (Invitrogen) for 1 hour at 4 C
on a rotating platform. The tubes were placed in a magnetic
stand and supernatants were discarded. The beads were
washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS. The immunoprecipitated
proteins were eluted by re-suspending the beads in 30 mL of 2
sample buffer and denatured by incubating at 95 C for 5
minutes. The eluted proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE
and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes for Western
blot analysis.
To evaluate the interaction of ERBB2 receptor with trastuzumab, cells were treated with trastuzumab (20 mg/mL) for 24
hours. After washing twice with ice-cold PBS, cells were

solubilized for 30 minutes at 4 C with lysis buffer (1% Triton
X-100) containing 1% Halt protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc). Total protein (200 mg) was incubated with
50 mL Dynabeads Protein G (Invitrogen) in an Eppendorf tube
for 1 hour at 4 C on a rotating platform to pull down specifically trastuzumab-bound ERBB2 protein. The tubes were
placed in a magnetic stand and supernatants were discarded.
The beads were then processed and the bound protein was
eluted as described above. Protein bands intensities were
semiquantitatively analyzed by densitometry using ImageJ
software (NIH Image). Pulled-down ERBB2 protein bands
intensities were depicted as ratios relative to their corresponding input ERBB2 proteins.
Nude mice xenograft experiments
Five-week-old female athymic nude-Foxn1 nu/nu mice
(Harlan Laboratories Inc.) were purchased and maintained
under speciﬁc pathogen-free conditions. The mice were randomized into 2 groups (10 xenografts per group). OE19 cells
stably expressing t-DARPP or pcDNA3 empty vector were
injected subcutaneously (s.c.; 4  106 cells, suspended in
200 mL growth factor-reduced Matrigel per site) into the
ﬂanks). After the xenografted tumors reached a volume of 200
mm3 or more, mice were treated with 20 mg/kg trastuzumab
diluted in sterile PBS by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection twice
weekly. To determine tumor volume, the greatest longitudinal
diameter (length) and the greatest transverse diameter (width)
were serially measured by external caliper. Tumor volume was
calculated by the formula: Tumor volume ¼ 1/2 (length 
width2). The Vanderbilt Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee approved all animal work.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as means  standard error of mean. All in
vitro experiments were carried out in triplicate. Statistical
signiﬁcance of the in vitro studies was evaluated by the
parametric unpaired Student t test. The t test, Wilcoxon Rank
Sum test, and Spearman correlation test were used for analyses
of primary tumors. Differences with P values 0.05 are considered signiﬁcant.

Results
t-DARPP overexpression is associated with tumor stage
and directly correlates with ERBB2 mRNA levels
Using the t-test, t-DARPP and ERBB2 were found to be
signiﬁcantly overexpressed in tumors as compared with
normal samples (P < 0.001; Fig. 1A). The Wilcoxon Rank
Sum test showed a similar result. The expression of t-DARPP
and ERBB2 showed a similar pattern in esophageal and
gastric adenocarcinomas. Overexpression (log2 fold expression 2.0) of ERBB2 was detected in 57 tumors (40%)
whereas t-DARPP was overexpressed in two-thirds of the
tumors. The use of a cutoff log2 fold expression 4.0 showed
overexpression of ERBB2 and t-DARPP in 22% and 48% of the
tumors, respectively. Statistical analysis using Spearman's
correlation coefﬁcient and correlation test, where the cutoff
for gene expression is log(5,2) ¼ 2.32, indicated that ERBB2

t-DARPP Mediates Trastuzumab Resistance

Figure 1. t-DARPP and ERBB2 are signiﬁcantly overexpressed in adenocarcinomas. A, signiﬁcant mRNA overexpression of t-DARPP and ERBB2 in
adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and stomach (141 tumors and 51 normal tissue samples; P < 0.001). B, Spearman correlation coefﬁcient and correlation
test in which the cutoff gene expression is log(5,2) ¼ 2.32 or more show that t-DARPP and ERBB2 overexpression levels are signiﬁcantly correlated in
tumors (r ¼ 0.58, P ¼ 0.003). C, the multivariate regression model analysis indicates that tumor stage has a signiﬁcant effect on t-DARPP mRNA gene
expression levels (P ¼ 0.02). D, left, cell viability of OE19 and OE33 cells in response to trastuzumab treatment was evaluated by Trypan blue staining.
OE19 cells were 2-fold more sensitive to trastuzumab than OE33 cells (P < 0.001). D, right, Western blot analysis shows higher protein expression of ERBB2 in
OE19 cells than OE33 cells. In contrast, t-DARPP expression was undetectable in OE19 cells but highly expressed in OE33 cells.

overexpression values in tumors were signiﬁcantly correlated with those of t-DARPP (r ¼ 0.58, P ¼ 0.003; Fig. 1B). The
multivariate regression model analysis indicated that tumor
stage was signiﬁcantly associated with t-DARPP gene expression values (P ¼ 0.02; Fig. 1C).
To establish cell models for investigating the role of t-DARPP
in trastuzumab resistance in esophageal adenocarcinoma, we
evaluated the survival of 2 esophageal adenocarcinoma cell
lines, OE19 and OE33, in response to trastuzumab. The results
of the trypan blue dye exclusion assay indicated that OE33
cells were more resistant to trastuzumab than OE19 cells (P <
0.001), as treatment with 20 or 60 mg/mL trastuzumab
decreased the survival by 70% in OE19 cells as opposed to
40% in OE33 cells (Fig. 1D, left). In addition, the results
showed that 20 mg/mL trastuzumab was a saturation concentration, as a higher drug concentration (60 mg/mL) had a
similar effect on survival in the 2 cell lines. The Western blot
analysis data showed that both OE19 and OE33 cells have high
protein expression levels of ERBB2, which is in line with the
reported increase in copy numbers of ERBB2 gene in these 2
cell lines (Fig. 1D, right). Although the t-DARPP protein was

highly expressed in OE33 cells, it was undetectable in OE19
cells (Fig. 1D, right), indicating that t-DARPP expression was
associated with increased trastuzumab resistance in esophageal cancer cells.
t-DARPP promotes cell survival in esophageal
adenocarcinoma
The CellTiter-Glo viability assay results showed that transiently expressed t-DARPP increased cell survival by 40%
relative to control cells in response to trastuzumab (P <
0.001; Fig. 2A). Similarly, stably expressed t-DARPP in OE19
cells enhanced cell survival by approximately 40% relative to
control cells after treatment with trastuzumab (P < 0.01; Fig.
2B). As an additional cell model in our study, we generated
trastuzumab-resistant OE19 cells through culturing sensitive
parental cells in increasing concentrations of trastuzumab for
6 months. Interestingly, unlike parental cells, the resistant cells
acquired expression of endogenous t-DARPP (Fig. 2C, bottom).
Indeed, following treatment with trastuzumab, cell survival
was signiﬁcantly higher in resistant cells than parental cells
(P < 0.01) (Fig. 2C, top).

Figure 2. t-DARPP enhances survival of esophageal cancer cells. A, cell viability of OE19 cells infected with control adenovirus (10 MOI) or t-DARPP adenovirus
(10 MOI) in response to treatment with vehicle or trastuzumab (20 mg/mL) for 48 hours was assessed by CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay.
B, cell viability of OE19 cells stably expressing pcDNA3 or t-DARPP treated with vehicle or trastuzumab (20 mg/mL) for 48 hours and determined
as in A. C, cell viability of parental and trastuzumab-resistant OE19 cells treated with vehicle or trastuzumab (20 mg/mL) for 48 hours and evaluated as in A.
D, OE19 cells stably expressing pcDNA3 or t-DARPP were subjected to clonogenic survival assay after treatment with vehicle or trastuzumab (20 mg/mL)
for 48 hours. Quantitative data are shown on the right. E, parental and trastuzumab-resistant OE19 cells were subjected to clonogenic survival assay after
treatment with vehicle or trastuzumab (20 mg/mL) as in D. Quantitative data are shown on the right. These results show that exogenous and endogenous
t-DARPP signiﬁcantly promoted cell survival in response to trastuzumab in OE19 cells.

To conﬁrm the short-term assay results, we conducted a
long-term clonogenic survival assay using the 2 OE19 cell
models. The results indicated that stable expression of tDARPP doubled the cell survival relative to control (P <
0.001) in response to trastuzumab (Fig. 2D). Moreover, endogenous expression of t-DARPP in resistant cells tripled the cell
survival relative to parental cells (P < 0.01) in response to
trastuzumab (Fig. 2E). These results show that t-DARPP
expression enhanced cell survival in response to trastuzumab
in esophageal adenocarcinoma cells.

The Annexin-V staining and FACS analysis results showed
that adenoviral transient expression of t-DARPP suppressed
early apoptosis events by approximately 25% relative to control
in response to trastuzumab (P < 0.02; Fig. 3A). In accordance
with this, Western blot analysis data revealed the cleaved

not lead to an increase in apoptosis as compared with nontreated cells, whereas parental cells showed an approximate
doubling in apoptosis levels after treatment with trastuzumab
(P < 0.01; Fig. 3C). In line with this result, Western blotting
showed cleavage of caspase-3 in parental cells, but not in
resistant cells after treatment with trastuzumab (Fig. 3D).
Together, these data indicated that t-DARPP expression counteracted trastuzumab-induced apoptosis in esophageal adenocarcinoma cells.
t-DARPP stabilizes ERBB2 protein and activates
downstream signaling in response to trastuzumab
The CHX-based chase assay results indicated that stable
expression of t-DARPP increased the half-life of ERBB2 protein
to 42.2 hours as opposed to 30.8 hours in control cells (Fig. 4A).
Similarly, the protein half-life of ERBB2 was 31.3 and 60.8 hours
in parental cells and resistant cells, respectively (Fig. 4B). These
results showed that t-DARPP expression signiﬁcantly
enhanced ERBB2 protein stability in esophageal adenocarcinoma cells. In accordance with these data, we used data from
immunoﬂuorescence analysis to show that ERBB2 expression
on the cell surface was approximately 2-fold higher in tDARPP-expressing cells than in control cells (P < 0.01; Supplementary Fig. S1).
We further investigated the role of t-DARPP in regulating the
AKT signaling pathway downstream of ERBB2 following trastuzumab treatment. Western blot analysis data showed that
trastuzumab treatment induced signiﬁcant dephosphorylation of ERBB2 and AKT in control OE19 cells, but this effect
was suppressed in OE19 cells transiently expressing t-DARPP

www.aacrjournals.org

(Fig. 4C). Similarly, stably expressed t-DARPP blocked trastuzumab-induced dephosphorylation of ERBB2 and AKT in OE19
cells (Fig. 4D). Further, these results were conﬁrmed in an
endogenous t-DARPP expression–resistant cell model (Fig.
4E). These data clearly showed that t-DARPP expression
maintained ERBB2 phosphorylation and activated the downstream AKT survival pathway in response to trastuzumab
treatment. Notably, t-DARPP-mediated ERBB2 protein stability was associated with increased levels of ERBB2, p-ERBB2
(Y1248), and p-AKT(S473) proteins in OE19 cells without
treatment with trastuzumab (Figs. 4C–4E).
Knockdown of endogenous t-DARPP sensitizes cells to
trastuzumab
Western blot analysis data indicated that knockdown of tDARPP and treatment with trastuzumab signiﬁcantly
decreased p-ERBB2(Y1248) and p-AKT(S473) protein levels
relative to controls (Fig. 5A). Knocking down t-DARPP alone,
without treatment with trastuzumab, decreased the p-AKT
(S473) protein level in OE33 cells (Fig. 5A). The CellTiter-Glo
viability assay results revealed that knockdown of t-DARPP in
combination with trastuzumab treatment decreased cell survival by 30% relative to control (P < 0.01; Fig. 5B). These results
clearly showed that knocking down endogenous t-DARPP in
OE33 cells signiﬁcantly sensitized cells to trastuzumab.
t-DARPP/ERBB2 protein interaction interferes with
trastuzumab binding to ERBB2 receptor
We hypothesized that t-DARPP interacts with ERBB2,

Figure 4. t-DARPP promotes ERBB2 protein stability, inhibits trastuzumab-dependent ERBB2 dephosphorylation, and activates downstream signaling. A,
ERBB2 protein stability in OE19 cells stably expressing t-DARPP or pcDNA3 empty vector was evaluated by Western blot analysis after treatment with
80 mg/mL CHX to block new protein synthesis for the indicated times. The protein degradation data indicate that t-DARPP expression extended the protein
half-life of ERBB2 from 30.8 to 42.2 hours relative to control (bottom). B, ERBB2 protein stability in parental and trastuzumab-resistant OE19 cells was
assessed by Western blot analysis after treatment with CHX (80 mg/mL) for the indicated times. The protein degradation data show that endogenous t-DARPP
expression in resistant cells was associated with increased ERBB2 protein half-life (60.8 hours) relative to parental cells (31.3 hours; bottom). C, Western blot

adenoviruses after treatment with vehicle or trastuzumab (20 mg/mL) for 24 hours. These data indicate that transient expression of t-DARPP increased
p-ERBB2(Y1248) and p-AKT(S473) basal protein levels, and blocked trastuzumab-dependent dephosphorylation of ERBB2 and AKT proteins. D, Western blot

and p-AKT(S473), and inhibited trastuzumab-dependent dephosphorylation of ERBB2 and AKT proteins. E, Western blot analysis of p-ERBB2(Y1248),

The results of 2-way reciprocal immunoprecipitation assay
showed that t-DARPP and ERBB2 coimmunoprecipitated,
indicating their association in the same protein complex
(Fig. 6A). We next investigated the effect of t-DARPP expression on trastuzumab binding to the ERBB2 receptor. Data
from the immunoprecipitation assay showed that transiently expressed t-DARPP in OE19 cells decreased the trastuzumab binding to ERBB2 receptor by 2.8-fold relative to
control cells (Fig. 6B). Similarly, endogenous t-DARPP

these data, we treated OE19 cells stably expressing t-DARPP

reagent. The immunoﬂuorescence staining results showed
that the trastuzumab-bound ERBB2 protein level was
approximately 5-fold lower in t-DARPP-expressing cells than
control cells (P < 0.01; Supplementary Fig. S2). In line with
this ﬁnding, the immunoﬂuorescence data showed strong
cytosolic expression of t-DARPP that also colocalized with
the membranous ERBB2 signal. Notably, cells expressing

treatment (Fig. 7A). In contrast, trastuzumab effectively inhibited growth of control tumors (Fig. 7B). Notably, t-DARPP
expression signiﬁcantly increased tumor growth rate (P < 0.01)
compared with the control (Fig. 7C, left). The control tumors
grew signiﬁcantly slower than t-DARPP tumors in response to
treatment with trastuzumab (P < 0.001; Fig. 7C, right). The
results from H&E staining indicated that trastuzumab effectively killed control tumors leaving ﬁbrotic and necrotic areas
with no obvious tumor cells (Fig. 7D, left), whereas this
treatment failed to affect growth of t-DARPP tumors as manifested by the presence of moderately to poorly differentiated
tumors (Fig. 7D, right).

Discussion
Although the incidence of EAC has increased rapidly in the
last decade, especially among Caucasian men, limited progress in the treatment of EAC has been achieved (31). The
prognosis of patients diagnosed with EAC remains poor with a
5-year relative survival rate of 10% to 20%. Over the past 15
years, targeted therapy approaches have made signiﬁcant
advances due to the rapid development of new drugs that aim
treatment at speciﬁc molecular targets that are critical for
cancer cell survival (32). Ampliﬁcation and overexpression of
ERBB2 has been identiﬁed in 15% to 20% of primary EAC tumor
specimens and their corresponding metastases (33, 34). Therefore, in addition to breast cancer, ERBB2 has been proposed as
a plausible target for treatment in esophageal cancers. Trastuzumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal anti-ERBB2
antibody, was initially approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration for the treatment of ERBB2 metastatic breast
carcinoma (19). With its successful application in breast

These data show protein association of ERBB2 with t-DARPP. B, Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitated endogenous ERBB2 protein with trastuzumab

cells. The band intensity of immunoprecipitated ERBB2 protein was shown as a ratio relative to input ERBB2. These data indicate that endogenous t-DARPP
expression in trastuzumab-resistant cells was associated with a signiﬁcant decrease in trastuzumab/ERBB2 protein interaction relative to control.

cancer, trastuzumab antitumor activity was investigated in
patients with ERBB2-positive metastatic cancer of gastroesophageal junction in combination with chemotherapy
(28). Notably, a phase III clinical trial (RTOG 1010 protocol)
is currently ongoing to evaluate the addition of trastuzumab to
increase disease-free survival when combined with trimodality
treatment for patients with ERBB2-positive esophageal adenocarcinoma. However, previous studies have shown that
cancer patients that initially respond well to trastuzumab
develop acquired trastuzumab resistance within a year of
treatment (20). Our current study provides important preclinical evidence indicating that t-DARPP could mediate trastuzumab resistance in EAC.
Our results indicate that both t-DARPP and ERBB2 were
signiﬁcantly overexpressed in a subset of EAC tumors. Moreover, overexpression of t-DARPP was signiﬁcantly associated
with advanced tumor stage. Notably, both ERBB2 and t-DARPP
are located inside the 17q21 chromosomal region, a commonly
ampliﬁed region in adenocarcinomas of the stomach and
esophagus (33, 35). Several studies have shown that ERBB2
plays an important role in activation of the prosurvival phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway (36).
Similarly, t-DARPP can mediate activation of the PI3K/AKT

4512

pathway (14). On the basis of these data, we hypothesized that
t-DARPP and ERBB2 may have a functional relationship where
t-DARPP-mediated activation of AKT could lead to resistance
to trastuzumab. The results indicated that endogenous and
exogenous t-DARPP expression can signiﬁcantly enhance cell
survival and block apoptosis in response to trastuzumab in
esophageal adenocarcinoma cell models. The xenografted
esophageal adenocarcinoma mouse model results conﬁrmed
the in vitro data and t-DARPP overexpressing tumors were
unaffected by trastuzumab treatment and continued to grow.
These results conﬁrmed the role of t-DARPP in mediating
resistance to trastuzumab in EAC cells. Our ﬁnding that
trastuzumab-resistant OE19 cells, generated by trastuzumab
selection, expressed a signiﬁcantly higher endogenous level of
t-DARPP than parental cells provides additional evidence
supporting the role of t-DARPP in mediating resistance to
trastuzumab. Interestingly, a breast cancer trastuzumab-resistant cell model expressed higher levels of t-DARPP (37). Taken
together, these data indicate the possible presence of a small
subpopulation of cells overexpressing t-DARPP among cancer
cells where treatment with trastuzumab provides the appropriate selection advantage for this subpopulation to continue
to grow and replace trastuzumab-sensitive cell populations.

t-DARPP Mediates Trastuzumab Resistance

Although we as well as other researchers have previously
shown that t-DARPP can lead to activation of AKT and
resistance to trastuzumab in breast cancer cells in vitro
(14, 37–39), the mechanism by which t-DARPP activates the
AKT survival pathway was not fully identiﬁed. In the current
study, our data clearly indicated that t-DARPP expression,
without treatment with trastuzumab, signiﬁcantly increased
ERBB2, p-ERBB2(Y1248), and p-AKT(S473) protein levels relative to control cells. Notably, the trastuzumab-resistant OE19
cells showed, in addition to t-DARPP overexpression, increased
p-ERBB2(Y1248) and p-AKT(S473) protein levels as compared
with parental cells, consistent with our ﬁndings from transient
and stable expression of t-DARPP. Taken together, these
results indicate that t-DARPP can signiﬁcantly enhance ERBB2
protein stability thereby enhancing the AKT pathway. In
addition, the possibility that t-DARPP could enhance the
protein stability of other members of the ERBB family remains
to be investigated in EAC.
Previous studies have shown that failure to suppress the
AKT pathway plays central role in resistance to trastuzumab in
breast cancer. Several mechanisms have been proposed, such
as activating mutations in the PI3KCA, deletions of PTEN,
overexpression of cMET, and overexpression of ERBB3 (40, 41).
In an attempt to elucidate the mechanistic role of t-DARPP in
trastuzumab resistance in EAC, we found that t-DARPP was
associated with ERBB2 in a protein complex. On the basis of
this ﬁnding, we hypothesized that t-DARPP interaction with
ERBB2 prevents trastuzumab binding to ERBB2 receptor, thus
blocking trastuzumab-induced downregulation of ERBB2/
AKT signaling. Indeed, our results clearly showed that t-DARPP
signiﬁcantly decreased trastuzumab binding to the ERBB2
receptor in OE19 cells. The immunoﬂuorescence data clearly
indicated that t-DARPP expression was cytosolic (Supplementary Fig. S2C), strongly indicating that t-DARPP interaction
with ERBB2 cytosolic domain could alter ERBB2 protein
folding and conformation, thereby interfering with trastuzumab binding to the ERBB2 extracellular domain. Nagy and
colleagues (42) uncovered a similar mechanism of trastuzu-

mab resistance in JIMT-1 breast cancer cells and showed that
the expression of MUC4, a transmembrane glycoprotein, promoted resistance to trastuzumab through masking of ERBB2,
which leads to diminished binding of trastuzumab. These data
indicate that molecular mechanisms that lead to the
impairment of binding of trastuzumab to its target, ERBB2,
are important upstream determinants of therapeutic response.
In conclusion, our ﬁndings indicate that frequent overexpression of t-DARPP in ERBB2-positive EAC forms the basis for
a trastuzumab resistance phenotype. Therefore, our data
indicate that t-DARPP expression status could potentially be
exploited for more effective clinical management of patients
with ERBB2-positive esophageal adenocarcinoma who qualify
for treatment with trastuzumab.
