BACKGROUND: Growing evidence suggests that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in nucleotide excision
repair (NER) pathway genes play an important role in bladder cancer etiology. However, only a limited number of
genes and variations in this pathway have been evaluated to date. METHODS: In this study, the authors applied a
comprehensive pathway-based approach to assess the effects of 207 tagging and potentially functional SNPs in 26
NER genes on bladder cancer risk using a large case-control study that included 803 bladder cancer cases and 803
controls. RESULTS: In total, 17 SNPs were associated significantly with altered bladder cancer risk (P < .05), of which,
7 SNPs retained noteworthiness after they were assessed with a Bayesian approach for the probability of false discovery. The most noteworthy SNP was reference SNP 11132186 (rs11132186) in the inhibitor of growth family, member 2
(ING2) gene. Compared with the major allele-containing genotypes, the odds ratio was 0.52 (95% confidence interval,
0.32-0.83; P ¼ .005) for the homozygous variant genotype. Three additional ING2 variants also exhibited significant
associations with bladder cancer risk. Significant gene-smoking interactions were observed for 3 of the top 17
SNPs. Furthermore, through an exploratory classification and regression tree (CART) analysis, potential gene-gene
interactions were identified. CONCLUSIONS: In this a large association study of the NER pathway and the risk of
bladder cancer, several novel predisposition variants were identified along with potential gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in modulating bladder cancer risk. The results reinforce the importance of a comprehensive,
pathway-focused, and tagging SNP-based candidate gene approach to identify low-penetrance cancer susceptibility

Bladder cancer ranks ninth in worldwide cancer incidence. It is the seventh most common cancer in men and the
17th most common in women.1 In the United States, it is the fifth most common cancer, the fourth most common in
men, and the 11th most common in women.2 Environmental exposures account for the majority of bladder cancer cases.
For example, tobacco smoking causes approximately 50% of bladder cancer incidence in men and 33% in women. In
addition, occupational exposures to aromatic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polluted drinking water
containing arsenic and chlorination by-product also contribute significantly to the development of bladder cancer.3 Other
environmental risk factors, such as dietary factors, hair dye use, artificial sweeteners, and phenacetin-containing analgesic
drugs, also have been reported, although the associations have not been consistent across different studies.3
Although the molecular mechanisms underlying these bladder cancer etiologic factors are not fully understood, it is
widely recognized that environmental carcinogens induce DNA damage that leads to genomic instability. Tobacco carcinogens mainly induce bulky DNA adducts, and the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway is the major cellular

pathway to repair bulky DNA adducts. Other cellular
DNA repair pathways, such as the base excision repair
(BER) and double-strand break repair (DSBR) pathways,
also play important roles in the prevention of bladder carcinogenesis through repairing single-strand and doublestrand DNA breaks caused by smoking, reactive oxygen
species, ionizing radiation, and other DNA-damaging
agents.4-7 In bladder cancer, the NER pathway is 1 of the
most commonly studied pathways that repairs bulky
DNA lesions, such as pyrimidine dimers, photoproducts,
larger chemical adducts, and cross-links. The NER pathway is also critical for the maintenance of genomic stability. There are 2 types of NER processes in human cells:
global genomic repair (GGR) and transcription-coupled
repair (TCR). Both processes have 4 major steps: 1) recognition of DNA lesions by a complex of interactive proteins, including xeroderma pigmentosum group Ccomplementing protein/Rad23 homolog B (XPCRAD23B), xeroderma pigmentosum complementation
group A (XPA), and replication protein A (RPA) in GGR
or excision repair cross-complementing rodent repair deficiency complementation group 6 (ERCC6) and Cockayne syndrome type A (CSTA) in TCR; 2) unwinding of
DNA strands within the region of lesions by the transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex, including the proteins
xeroderma pigmentosum D protein (XPD) and xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group B (XPB);
3) elimination of damaged DNA fragments by a protein
complex that includes ERCC1, XPF, and XPG; and 4)
synthesis of new DNA strands by various DNA polymerases.8 Defects in these critical genes have been identified
frequently in many cancers, including bladder cancer.9,10
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of NER
pathway genes have been implicated in bladder cancer etiology.9 For example, we and others previously reported
that SNPs in major NER genes, such as XPC, XPD, cyclin
H (CCNH), and RAD23B, are associated significantly
with bladder cancer risk.11-15 However, those studies
mostly took a limited candidate gene approach, which
evaluates a small number of genes and potential functional SNPs. In the current study, we performed a comprehensive pathway-based study to assess the effects of
207 haplotype-tagging and potentially functional SNPs
in 26 major genes in the NER pathway on bladder cancer
risk in a total of 803 patients with bladder cancer and a
group of 803 healthy controls. Then, we conducted a series of exploratory analyses to evaluate the cumulative
effects and interactions of these variants on the risk of
bladder cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population and Epidemiology Data
The study participants were derived from an ongoing hospital-based bladder cancer case-control study. The cases
were patients with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed, and previously untreated bladder cancer who were
recruited at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Baylor College of Medicine between 1999
and 2007. There were no age, sex, ethnicity, or diseasestage restrictions on the recruitment. The controls were
healthy individuals with no prior history of cancer (except
nonmelanoma skin cancer) who were recruited from the
Kelsey-Seybold Clinic, which is the largest multispecialty,
managed-care physician group in the Houston metropolitan area. Controls were matched to cases by age (5 years),
sex, and ethnicity. To control for confounding of population stratification, we restricted both cases and controls to
self-reported non-Hispanic Caucasians for the current
analysis. These cases and controls also were included in our
recent genome-wide association study of bladder cancer,
and there was no evidence of population substructure
among cases and controls.16 The potential controls were
surveyed first by a Kelsey-Seybold staff member during
clinical registration using a short questionnaire to elicit
their willingness to participate in the study and to provide
preliminary demographic data for matching. They were
contacted by telephone at a later date to schedule an interview appointment at a Kelsey-Seybold Clinic location convenient to the participant. The response rate for the
ongoing study was 92% for cases and 76.7% for controls.
All cases and controls in this study completed a structured,
45-minute questionnaire administered by trained staff
interviewers from The University of Texas MD Anderson
Cancer Center. The questionnaire collected information
about demographics, smoking history, family history of
cancer, and medical history. At the end of the interview, a
40-mL blood sample was drawn into a coded heparinized
tube and sent to the laboratory for immediate DNA extraction and molecular analyses. This study was approved by
all relevant institutional review boards, and signed
informed consent was obtained from each participant.
Selection of Genes and Polymorphisms
A comprehensive list of genes in the NER pathway
was developed through an interrogation of the Gene Ontology (GO) database (http://www.geneontology.org;
accessed May 3, 2011) and a PubMed-based literature
review, as previously described.17 Tagging SNPs were
selected by the binning algorithm of LDSelect software

May 3, 2011) with a correlation coefficient (r2) threshold
of 0.8 and minor allele frequencies >0.05 within 10 kb
upstream of the 50 untranslated region (50 -UTR) and 10
kb downstream of the 30 -UTR of each gene. We also
included a few nonsynonymous SNPs that were identified
in the National Center for Biotechnology Information
SNP database (dbSNP) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
projects/SNP/; accessed May 3, 2011). Because this was a
gene-centered candidate region search, we achieved 100%
coverage of our targeted genomic regions. The number of
SNPs for each gene region was as follows: CCNH, 3
SNPs; cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7), 2 SNPs; damaged DNA binding protein 2 (DDB2), 9 SNPs; ERCC1,
2 SNPs; ERCC2, 8 SNPs; ERCC3, 5 SNPs; ERCC4, 8

ATP-dependent (LIG1), 9 SNPs; MMS19 nucleotide

SNPs; RPA2, 3 SNPs; RPA3, 28 SNPs; XPA binding protein 2 (XAB2), 5 SNPs; XPA, 7 SNPs; and XPC, 8 SNPs.
Genotyping
Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using
the Qiagen Whole Blood DNA Extraction Kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, Calif). The genotyping was performed using the
iSelect Infinium II platform according to Illumina’s protocol, as described previously (Illumina, Inc., San Diego,
Calif).12,17 Briefly, 750 ng of DNA from each sample
were amplified 1000-fold to 1500-fold overnight. The
amplified DNA was fragmented, precipitated, and resuspended before it was hybridized to the iSelect Beadchip,
which contains SNP locus-specific oligonucleotide primers (50 base pairs long) covalently attached to the bead
surface. After specific hybridization of genomic DNA to
the bead array, each SNP locus-specific primer (attached
to beads) was extended with a single hapten-labeled
dideoxynucleotide in a single base extension reaction.
Incorporated haptens were converted to fluorescent signal
by multilevel immunohistochemistry staining and were
imaged using the BeadStation Scanner (Illumina, Inc.).
The genotype for each SNP was autocalled using the
BeadStudio software package (Illumina, Inc.) and processed for further statistical analyses. The average call rate
for SNPs is >99%. Individuals with >5% missing geno-

types and SNPs with >5% missing calls were excluded
from downstream analyses. Randomly selected 2% of
samples were run in duplicate, and the concordance of
SNP genotype calls was >99.9% for duplicated samples.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using Intercooled
STATA software (version 10.1; Stata Corp., College Station, Tex) and SAS/Genetics (version 9.0; SAS Institute,
Cary, NC). The chi-square test was used to assess the differences between cases and controls with regard to categorical variables, such as sex and smoking status. The
Student t test was used to test for continuous variables,
including age and pack-years. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was tested using a goodness-of-fit chi-square
test. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) were calculated using multivariate logistic regression
to identify SNPs that were associated significantly with
bladder cancer risk while adjusting for confounding factors, including age, sex, and smoking status. For each
SNP, genotypes containing the homozygous major allele
were used as the reference group to calculate the ORs and
95% CIs for genotypes containing the variant allele. The
definitions of smoking status were the same as previously
described.18 P values were calculated using the likelihoodratio test to compare the models with and without the variables of interest in multivariate logistic regression. Dominant, recessive, and additive models were tested for each
SNP, and the reported P value was the smallest from the
above 3 tests. We assessed the noteworthiness of an
observed significant association using a Bayesian false-discovery probability (BFDP) approach proposed by Wakefield.19 This approach has been adopted and used in
several epidemiologic studies to control for multiple testing.20-25 We used all P values from different inheritance
models (additive, recessive, and dominant) to perform the
BFDP analyses. We adjusted all 207 tests at the SNP level
and assumed a range of prior probability from .01 to .05.
We set the prior probability that the OR is >2.0 as .025.
An association was declared as significant if BFDP was
<0.8 for a prior probability of .05 (considered to a moderate prior for pathway-based association study).19 The
test for interaction between genotypes and smoking was
done by including an interaction term in the logistic
regression. We tested for interactions between SNPs and
smoking status (never and ever) and between SNPs and
pack-years of smoking (as continuous variable). For the
SNPs with significant main effects, we reported results of
stratified analyses by smoking status and the interactions

of these SNPs with smoking status. We also reported
SNPs with nominally significant interactions with packyears of smoking (P < .05). We also performed exploratory classification and regression tree (CART) analyses to
identify potential gene-gene interactions using the HelixTree software package; (version 4.1.0; Golden Helix,
Bozeman, Mont). CART is a binary recursive partitioning
method that produces a decision tree to identify subgroups at different risk levels. Specifically, the recursive
partitioning algorithm starts at the first node (with the
entire dataset) and determines the first locally optimal
split and each subsequent split of the dataset with multiplicity-adjusted P values to control tree growth. We used
P ¼ .001 to grow the tree and q ¼ .05 to prune the overgrown tree and control the final tree size. All P values in
this study were 2-sided.

RESULTS
Characteristics of the Study Population
Our participants consisted of 803 Caucasian patients with
bladder cancer and 803 age (5 years) and sex frequencymatched Caucasian controls (Table 1). Cases had a significantly higher percentage of current smokers and recent
quitters than controls (23.3% vs 8.3%; P ¼ 5.2  1021).
Among ever-smokers, cases reported significantly higher
levels of cigarette consumption than controls (mean packyears, 43.0 vs 29.9; P ¼ 2.8  1012).
Main-Effect Analysis of Individual NER SNPs
Among the 207 NER SNPs, 17 (8.2%) were associated
significantly with bladder cancer risk at the 5% level (Ta-

208

ble 2), among which 1 SNP (reference SNP [rs] number
rs4151330) had a statistically significant deviation from
HWE (P < .05) in controls, consistent with what was
expected by chance. The most noteworthy finding in our
study was related to the ING2 gene. Four of the 6 ING2
SNPs conferred a significantly altered risk of bladder cancer; the most significant was rs11132186, an SNP located
in the 30 region of ING2. Under a recessive genetic model,
the homozygous variant genotype of rs11132186 was
associated with a reduced risk of bladder cancer (OR,
0.52; 95% CI, 0.32-0.83; P ¼ .005). Another ING2 SNP
in the 30 region, rs11735038, also conferred a reduced
bladder cancer risk (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.49-0.90; P ¼
.008) under a recessive genetic model. The other 2 significant ING2 SNPs were rs6854224 in the 50 region (OR,
0.70; 95% CI, 0.53-0.93; P ¼ .013; recessive model) and
rs11732255 in the 30 region (OR, 0.84 95% CI, 0.720.98; P ¼ .025; additive model) (Table 2). There are 2
additional SNPs that exhibited best-fitting P values < .01
and conferred an increased risk of bladder cancer:
rs11039130 in the 50 region of DDB2 (OR, 1.64; 95%
CI, 1.14-2.35; P ¼ .007) and rs4150667 in the intron of
GTF2H1 (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.12-2.15; P ¼ .008). In
addition, we assessed the noteworthiness of these significant associations using BFDP. We observed that 7 of the
17 significant SNPs had a BFDP value <0.8 (range, 0.720.80), suggesting the potential noteworthiness of their
associations with bladder cancer risk (Table 2). Table 3
provides the detailed distributions of different genotypes
(homozygous major allele, heterozygote, and homozygous
variant) of these 7 SNPs in cases and controls and the associations of each genotype with bladder cancer risk as well
as the best fitting model for each SNP.
Stratified Analyses by Smoking Status
We also performed stratified analysis by smoking status
(data not shown). There were significant overlaps of top
SNPs between analysis of the overall population and
smokers; for example, the top 2 SNPs in smokers, DDB2
rs1685404 (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52-0.86; P ¼ .0021;
under dominant model) and GTF2H1 rs4150667 (OR,
1.90; 95% CI, 1.24-2.89; P ¼ .0024; under recessive
model), were the eighth and fourth most significant SNPs
in overall analysis, respectively. For never-smokers, the
most significant SNP, XPA rs10817938 (OR, 0.26; 95%
CI, 0.12-0.60; P ¼ .0003; under dominant model), was
not significant in overall analysis (P ¼ .67). Then, we
tested interactions between significant SNPs and smoking
status in modulating bladder cancer risk. Many of the top

Adjusted for age, sex, and smoking status.

SNPs exhibited similar effects on bladder cancer risk in
never-smokers and ever-smokers, but there were significant SNP-smoking interactions for a few SNPs (Table 2).
CCNH rs10065575 was the third most significant SNP in
never-smokers (P ¼ .0012) but was not significant in
ever-smokers, and the test of interaction revealed a significant interaction of this SNP with smoking status (P ¼
.034) (Table 2). Significant interactions with smoking status also were observed for DDB2 rs1685404 (P ¼ .038)
and ERCC6 rs4453140 (P ¼ .009) (Table 2).

the 17 SNPs, only rs1685404 on DDB2 had a significant
main effect. The other 2 SNPs that had significant main
effects as well as significant interactions with smoking status (CCNH rs10065575 and ERCC6 rs4453140) (Table
2) were not significant in this analysis, suggesting that
quantitative measures of smoking provide more information that smoking status. Because we did not have sufficient power to detect SNP-smoking interaction, this
analysis was exploratory, and no multiple testing correction was applied.

SNP-Smoking (Pack-Years) Interactions
We also performed a detailed analysis of the interactions
between all assayed SNPs and pack-years of smoking (as
continuous variable). Table 4 lists the 17 SNPs that had
nominally significant interactions with pack-years (P <
.05). The most significant SNP was rs4151150 in
MNAT1, which exhibited a significant, negative interaction with pack-years (b ¼ 0.026; P ¼ .0018). Among

Haplotype Analysis
We performed a haplotype analysis for ING2 and DDB2,
the 2 genes with several significant SNPs (Table 5). We
calculated the pairwise D0 to measure linkage disequilibrium between SNPs in each gene and observed no significant linkages. (D0 range, 0.13-0.51 for ING2 SNPs,
0.18-0.31 for DDB2 SNPs; data not shown). In total, 12
haplotypes and 9 haplotypes with a frequency of >1%

CART Analysis
CART analysis uses a binary recursive partitioning
method to identify subgroups of high-risk individuals and
detects higher order interactions among a large number of
variables. Figure 1A depicts the resulting tree structure
generated by CART analysis. The initial split was
rs1051315 in RPA1 gene. In individuals who had the
homozygous major allele-containing genotype of
rs1051315, the tree structure was generated further

according to the genotype information for CCHN
rs10065575, ERCC2 rs1799787, RPA1 rs3744467,
ING2 rs6854224, MNAT1 rs1885094, and MNAT1
rs4151330, resulting in different subgroups (terminal
nodes), each with a distinct combination of genotypes and
a different risk estimate. Figure 1B summarizes the risk
estimates for individuals in each terminal node. Compared with individuals in Terminal Node 1, individuals in
Terminal Node 3 exhibited a significantly increased risk
of bladder cancer (OR, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.56-4.26; P ¼ 2.1
 104); whereas individuals in Terminal Node 6 had a
significantly reduced risk (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.26-0.67;
P ¼ 4.0  104). We tested the interactions between
SNPs identified from this CART analysis. There were significant interactions between CCNH rs10065575 and
ING2 rs6854224 (P ¼ .014), between ING2 rs6854224
and MNAT1 rs4151330 (P ¼ .017), and between CCNH
rs10065575 and MNAT1 rs1885094 (P ¼ .043). These
interactions resulted in Terminal Nodes 4 through 7.
Because of the post-hoc data-mining nature of CART
analysis, these results are exploratory.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we assessed the effects of a comprehensive
panel of 207 SNPs in 26 genes in the NER pathway on the
risk of bladder cancer. The ING2 gene was the most noteworthy finding, and 4 of 6 evaluated ING2 SNPs exhibited
significant associations with the risk of bladder cancer. Furthermore, we observed potential gene-smoking interaction
and higher order interactions among these NER SNPs in
the modulation of bladder cancer susceptibility.
Our findings for ING2 are biologically plausible.
ING2 is a member of the inhibitor of growth (ING) gene
family and encodes a putative tumor suppressor protein
involved in the regulation of DNA repair, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and epigenetic functions in a p53-dependent manner. The ING2 gene was cloned first in 1998
as a homolog of the first ING family member, ING1.26
The ING2 gene is 6 kb in length and is located in chromosome region 4q35.1. The implication of ING2 in NER
was established first by Wang et al, who observed that
overexpression of the ING2 gene significantly enhanced
the repair of ultraviolet-induced DNA damage.27 This
function of ING2 depends on the normal functions of the
p53 protein, because small-interfering RNA-mediated
degradation of either ING2 or p53 abolished the observed
repair capacity.27 Furthermore, Wang et al demonstrated
that the ING2 protein is not a component of the NER
core protein complex; instead, ING2 enhances NER
Cancer

through recruiting XPA to the core complex.27 The function of ING2 in DNA repair also is mediated by interaction with trimethylated and dimethylated H3K4, which
stabilizes the mammalian Sin3 homolog A–histone deacetylase 1 protein complex to enhance the transcriptional activity of many relevant genes.28 In addition to its
involvement in NER, ING2 also has been implicated in
G1-phase cell cycle arrest through increasing the transcriptional activation ability of p53.29 Furthermore,
ING2 interacts with phosphoinositides to activate the
p53-dependent apoptosis pathway.30 In our study, all 4
significant ING2 SNPs, which are not in strong linkage,
were associated with reduced risks of bladder cancer.
Among them, 3 SNPs are located in the 30 region of gene,
and 1 is located in the 50 region of ING2, 5.5 kb upstream
of the translation start codon. Because the promoter and
enhancer sequences of ING2 have not been well characterized experimentally, it remains to be determined whether
these SNPs have any functional significance. It is more
likely that they are tagging SNPs but not the causal variants. Therefore, high-density mapping in combination
with functional characterizations are warranted to further
elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the association between ING2 SNPs and bladder cancer risk
observed in the current study.
Another noteworthy gene we identifies in this study
was DDB2. The DDB2 gene contains 8 exons and spans
approximately 24 kb in chromosomal 11p12-p11.31
Because it is a response protein to DNA damage induced
by genotoxic agents, such as ultraviolet irradiation, DDB2
interacts with cullin 4A (CUL4A); ring-box 1, E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (RBX1); and constitutive photomorphogenic homolog subunit 2 (COPS2) to form a protein
complex that binds to chromatin and initiates the NER
process.32 DDB2 enhances the DNA binding activity of
DDB1 and serves as a crucial component in the p53mediated DNA repair process.33,34 Two SNPs of DDB2
exhibited a significant association with bladder cancer
risk. One SNP, rs11039130, which is located approximately 7 kb upstream of the transcription start site, was
associated with a 1.64-fold increased risk under a recessive
model. The other SNP, rs1685404, which is located in
the 30 region of the gene, conferred a reduced bladder cancer risk under a dominant model. Several studies have
reported that transcription of the DDB2 gene is tightly
regulated by a wide array of transcription, factors such as
the E2F family, breast cancer 1 (BRCA1), specialty protein 1 (Sp1), Myc, and nuclear factor (NF1).35-37 However, whether rs1685404 is a direct causative locus or a

213

Original Article

surrogate remains to be determined through further fine
mapping and functional characterization.
We performed stratified analysis according to smoking status and tested interactions between SNP and smoking (smoking status and pack-years). Because of the
limited power to detect SNP-smoking interaction, the
current analysis was exploratory, and further validation
with a larger sample size is needed. It is noteworthy that
the effects of CCNH and ERCC6 SNPs were stronger in
never-smokers, whereas the effect of DDB2 SNP was evident only in ever-smokers, and other SNPs had similar
effects in never-smokers and ever-smokers. This observation is in line with a recent genome-wide association study
(GWAS) of bladder cancer in which the N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) slow-acetylator genotype was associated
with an increased risk of bladder cancer in ever-smokers
but not in never-smokers, but the effect of the glutathione
S-transferase l1 (GSTM1) null genotype was the strongest in never-smokers and grew progressively weaker in former and current smokers.38 Eight other GWAS-confirmed
SNPs demonstrated similar effects among never-smokers
and ever-smokers.38 It is intriguing that different genotypes
in carcinogen metabolism and DNA repair exhibited differential effects on bladder cancer risk among never-smokers and ever-smokers. Other exposures may explain such
interactions. Occupational exposure is the second major
environmental risk factor for bladder cancer. Our previous
publication indicated that prolonged exposure to diesel
fuel or fumes on a regular basis and exposures to tar/mineral oil, dry cleaning fluids, leather and tanning solutions,
rubber products, glues, pesticides, insecticides, or herbicides, fertilizers, arsenic, zinc, radioactive materials, and aromatic amine all were associated with an increased risk of
bladder cancer.39 It would be interesting to assess the NER
SNPs and bladder cancer risk in the context of these different DNA-damaging exposures. Because only a small percentage of our study populations were exposed to these
different occupational exposures, the power to detect significant associations in exposed populations was limited.
Future studies are warranted to address this question.
We also conducted exploratory CART analyses to
assess potential higher order gene-gene interactions within
the NER pathway genes. The process of tumorigenesis in
sporadic cancers is a multifactorial and multistep process
that involves complicated interactions of various low-penetrance genetic and environmental components. The
CART analysis identified subsets of individuals with different cancer risks based on different combinations of genotypes, and the OR for individuals in each terminal

214

node ranged from 0.42 to 2.58 (Fig. 1). A paired interaction analysis supported some of the SNP-SNP interactions. These data suggest that gene-gene interactions play
an important role in bladder cancer etiology. Nevertheless, because CART analysis is a post-hoc data-mining
tool that was applied to the same dataset, the results are
preliminary and should be interpreted with caution.
The strengths of our study include a large and homogenous study population, a comprehensive panel of
genes in the relatively well characterized NER pathway,
and the use of a haplotype-tagging SNP-based genotyping
approach. The limitation of this study is that, although we
applied a BFDP approach (1 of several available statistical
methods) to control for multiple testing, it is possible that
some of our reported SNPs are false-positive findings. The
main reason for our choice of BFDP is that the noteworthy
threshold defined by the BFDP approach accounts for the
costs of false discovery and nondiscovery. The other alternative approaches to correct for multiple testing, such as
the Bonferroni correction for independent tests and the
P(ACT) method to compute P values adjusted for correlated tests,40 do not consider the cost of nondiscovery and
are more conservative. Regardless of the method used for
correcting multiple testing, the ultimate way to eliminate
false-positive findings is through independent validation.
We reported both the significant SNPs after multiple testing correction by the BFDP method and the nominally significant SNPs in main-effect and SNP-smoking
interaction analyses. External validations in independent
epidemiology studies with adequate sample sizes are warranted to confirm the results from our studies.
