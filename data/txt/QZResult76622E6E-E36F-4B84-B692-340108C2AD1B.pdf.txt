BACKGROUND. Micropapillary bladder carcinoma is a rare variant of urothelial
carcinoma. To improve understanding of this disease, the authors performed a
retrospective review of their experience.

METHODS. The authors reviewed the records of 100 consecutive patients with

micropapillary bladder cancer who were evaluated at The University of Texas M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center.

RESULTS. The mean age of the patients was 64.7 years, with a male:female ratio of
10:1. The TNM stage of disease at the time of presentation was Ta in 5 patients, carcinoma in situ (CIS) in 4 patients, T1 in 35 patients, T2 in 26 patients, T3 in 7
patients, T4 in 6 patients; N1 in 9 patients, and M1 in 8 patients. Kaplan-Meier

metastatic disease. Of 55 patients undergoing radical cystectomy for surgically resectable disease (cT4a), 23 received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 32 were treated with initial cystectomy, with no significant difference noted in stage
distribution between the 2 groups. For the 23 patients treated with neoadjuvant
chemotherapy, the median OS was 43.2 months with 32% of patients still alive at 5
years. For the 32 patients treated with initial cystectomy, the median survival had
not been reached at the time of last follow-up, with 71% still alive at 5 years.
CONCLUSIONS. Micropapillary bladder cancer is associated with a poor prognosis.
Intravesical therapy appears to be ineffective in this disease and patients with surgically resectable disease should be offered early radical cystectomy. Cancer

ladder cancer is reported to affect approximately 60,000 patients
in the U.S. each year.1 Although the majority of tumors are transitional cell carcinomas, it is important to recognize the presence of
a variant histology because this has important ramifications for
prognosis as well as the approach to therapy. A variant of bladder
cancer, micropapillary carcinoma, was first described at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in 1994.2 The histologic
features of micropapillary bladder cancer closely resemble papillary
serous carcinoma of the ovary, with delicate filiform processes noted
along with infiltrating clusters of micropapillary aggregates without
central vascular cores. Prior reports estimated that micropapillary
bladder cancer accounts for 0.7% to 2.2% of all urothelial tumors.2,3
Given its rarity, the optimal treatment strategy for this tumor to our

knowledge remains undefined and various strategies
have been proposed, based mainly on small, singlecenter experiences.
To improve our understanding of this uncommon disease and to define outcomes with current
management, we performed a review of 100 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of micropapillary bladder cancer who were evaluated at the University of
Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. In the current
study, we present what to our knowledge is the largest known series of patients with this variant of
urothelial carcinoma of the bladder presented to
date.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
An institutional review board-approved search was
performed of the records of bladder cancer patients
treated at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson
Cancer Center between 1989 and 2004. From this
search, we identified 100 consecutive patients who
were diagnosed with micropapillary cancer of the
bladder. Patients were considered as having micropapillary disease if a review of the pathologic material
(by our genitourinary pathologists) revealed any
micropapillary component in their tumor; this diagnosis was sometimes not made at the time of the initial assessment at the referring institution. Since the
time of our original report,2 we have classified
all patients with micropapillary features as having
‘‘micropapillary bladder cancer’’ regardless of the
actual percentage of the micropapillary component
due to our recognition of its aggressive potential and
the fact that we are often not provided with the
entire specimen by the referring hospital.
Patient records were reviewed for demographic,
clinical, and pathologic characteristics as well as
treatment and outcome information. Clinical stage of
disease at the time of presentation and pathologic
stage at the time of cystectomy were determined by
reviewing radiologic, pathologic, and surgical reports.
Survival data were analyzed using the KaplanMeier method, with univariate log-rank tests used to
evaluate possible associations between survival rates
and risk factors. Survival times were measured to the
date of death or last follow-up. The Wilcoxon ranksum test and Fisher exact test were used to test for
statistical differences between continuous variables
and categoric variables, respectively. All P values presented are 2-sided, and statistical significance was
set at P < .05. Analyses were performed using SAS
software (version 8.2; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC)
and S-Plus software (version 6.1; Insightful Corporation, Seattle, WA).

RESULTS
Overall Characteristics
The majority of patients (91%) presented with at
least invasion of the lamina propria (cT1 disease)
(Table 1). Overall, 81 patients were classified initially
as having surgically resectable disease (ie, cT4aN0),
but only 44 patients (54% of the surgically resectable
patients) had nonmuscle-invasive disease at the time
of presentation. The stage distribution of the 19
patients with clinically unresectable disease was cT4b
in 2 patients, cN1 (any lymph node disease) in 9
patients, and cM1 (visceral metastasis) in 8 patients.
Overall Survival Results
With follow-up ranging from 1 to 182 months, the
median overall survival (OS) and median cancer-specific survival (CSS) were similar at 72 months
because all but 2 patients who died had died of their
disease. Kaplan-Meier estimates of 5-year and
10-year OS rates were 54% and 27%, respectively
(Fig. 1).
Survival by Stage of Disease at Presentation
Of 100 patients, the clinical disease stage of 81
patients indicated that they had disease that was
potentially resectable by radical cystectomy
(cT4aN0), whereas 19 patients presented with unresectable disease (Fig. 2). Of the 81 patients, 44 were
found to have nonmuscle-invasive disease at the
time of presentation and 37 had invasive but resectable disease. As previously reported, of the 44 patients
with nonmuscle-invasive disease,4 the majority (27
patients) underwent a trial of bladder preservation

with intravesical bacillus Calmette–Guerin (BCG)
whereas 12 patients underwent cystectomy as their
initial therapy. The median survival for these 44
patients was 81 months, with a mean survival of
62.1 months. Patients who underwent cystectomy
after disease progression to muscle invasion had a
median CSS of 61.7 months and a 5-year CSS rate of
60%. Those who underwent initial cystectomy were
found to have a 5-year CSS rate of 72%. The median
survival for patients who underwent initial cystectomy had not been reached at the time of last
follow-up (P ¼ .39).
The median OS for those patients presenting
with invasive (but resectable) disease had not been
reached at the time of last follow-up, with the mean
survival being 67.9 months. Patients who presented
with nonresectable disease had a median survival of
17 months (mean, 24.3 months). All but 1 patient
with distant metastatic disease died of their disease.

Survival by Mode of Therapy
Intravesical therapy
Table 2 shows the initial therapies received by the
patients after transurethral resection (TUR) (Table 2).
Twenty-nine patients (35.9%) underwent intravesical therapy with BCG, including 2 patients with cT2 disease (both of whom refused cystectomy). At a median
of 8 months after therapy, 18 of 27 patients (67%) with
initially nonmuscle-invasive disease had developed
disease progression, and 6 patients (22%) had developed metastatic disease. Only 17% of the patients (5
of 29 patients) who underwent intravesical therapy
had no evidence of disease at a median follow-up of
30 months. It is interesting to note that of the 5 patients
with an intact bladder who had no evidence of disease
at the time of last follow-up, none were found to have
lymphovascular invasion on the TUR specimen.
Radical cystectomy
Sixty-five patients underwent cystectomy, including
10 who initially presented with unresectable disease
(pelvic lymph node metastasis in 9 patients and T4b
disease in 1 patient). These 10 patients were treated
on protocol with systemic chemotherapy and underwent cystectomy only after they achieved an objective response to systemic chemotherapy. The median
OS for these patients was 28 months, which,
although quite remarkable for such a high-risk group,
is still quite inferior to the outcome of those patients
with clinically resectable disease who underwent cystectomy (median OS of 85 months; P ¼ .006).

A total of 55 of the 65 patients (84.6%) underwent cystectomy for surgically resectable disease
(cT4aN0M0) and were treated with the intention of
rendering them free of disease with either radical
cystectomy alone (32 patients) or neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by cystectomy (23 patients). There
was no significant difference noted in the clinical T
classification distribution between the neoadjuvant
chemotherapy and the cystectomy groups; however,
there were significantly more patients found to have
lymphovascular invasion in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group (47.8% vs 12.5%) (Table 3), reflecting
our selection criteria for neoadjuvant chemotherapy.5
For the 32 patients who were treated with initial
cystectomy, the median survival had not been
reached at the time of last follow-up and KaplanMeier estimates of the 5-year and 10-year OS rates
were 70% and 52%, respectively (Fig. 3). It is interesting to note that the pathologic stage was higher than

vs initial chemotherapy [Chemo]). E/N indicates events/number.

the clinical stage for 24 of 32 patients treated with
initial cystectomy (75%), including a 38% incidence
of N1 disease. No patient was found to have pT0
disease despite our practice of performing ‘‘complete
TUR,’’ which could be a possible reflection of the
rapid growth of the tumor.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical cystectomy
For the 23 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the median survival was 62 months with
63% of patients surviving 5 years. Pathologic downstaging occurred in 14 of 23 patients (61%) whereas
the pathologic stage was greater than expected in 5
patients (22%). It is interesting to note that, despite
comparable clinical stages, a larger proportion of
patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy were
found to have nonorgan-confined disease (pT3) on
pathologic examination compared with those treated
with initial surgery (68.7% vs 34.8%; P ¼ .0157).
Survival by Pathologic Stage
The pathologic stage distribution for patients undergoing cystectomy with curative intent was pTis in 5
patients, pT0 in 9 patients, pT1 in 6 patients, pT2 in 5
patients, pT3 in 12 patients, pT4 in 2 patients, pN1 in
14 patients, and M1 (peritoneal implant) in 1 patient
(Fig. 4). It is interesting to note that 8 of 9 patients
who were rendered as having pT0 disease remained
disease free at a median follow-up of 38 months.
Similarly, there were no cancer-related deaths noted
in the 4 patients who were found to have only CIS in
the cystectomy specimen. The incidence of pathologic upstaging overall was 52.7%, and the incidence
of occult lymph node disease detected at the time of

cystectomy was 27.3%. Of the 15 patients with lymph
node-positive disease, 11 received adjuvant chemotherapy and 5 were alive at the time of last follow-up,
with follow-up times ranging from 29 months to 42
months after cystectomy. For patients who were classified as having N0 disease, patients with organ-confined disease (pT2) had a median survival of 82.8
months from the date of cystectomy compared with a
median survival of 38.1 months for those patients
with nonorgan-confined disease (P ¼ .18).

DISCUSSION
Carcinomas with micropapillary features have been
described in the breast, lung, and urinary tract and
are nearly always associated with an advanced stage
of disease at the time of presentation and an aggressive clinical course.6 The prototype micropapillary
pattern is papillary serous carcinoma of the ovary,
which demonstrates a propensity to spread aggressively along peritoneal surfaces.
In the what to our knowledge is the first report
of this disease occurring in the bladder,2 94% of 18
patients presented with muscle-invasive disease and
39% died of their disease at a mean follow-up of 44
months. Johansson et al. reported on 20 patients,3
the majority of whom (75%) presented with T3a.
Only 4 patients had survived at 7 years. The authors
concluded that because external beam radiation and
chemotherapy both appear to be ineffective, no alternative to radical cystectomy exists.3 More recently,
Samaratunga et al.6 reported 20 cases of micropapillary bladder cancer and correlated the extent of disease on the cystectomy specimen with pathologic
stage. In this series, there was a significant correla-

tion found between pathologic stage and extent of
disease such that all 5 patients with <pT2 disease
(100%) had only focal areas of micropapillary carcinoma compared with only 1 of the patients with
pT2 disease (6%). Given this strong association
between extent of disease and pathologic stage, it is
not surprising that they found that patients with
focal micropapillary disease (who also had pT1 and
pTa tumors) fared better than patients with more
extensive micropapillary disease (those who were
found to have more advanced tumors at the time of
surgery). In the current series, because the diagnosis
of micropapillary bladder cancer was often made by
our pathologists at the time of review of the patient
slides sent to our institution by the referring physicians, we did not have access to the entire resected
tumor and therefore were unable to assess the proportion of micropapillary component compared with
nonmicropapillary component in the tumor. However, since our original report of this variant in 1994,2
it has been our practice to consider any patient having even a focus of micropapillary carcinoma to have
‘‘micropapillary bladder cancer’’ due to the inherent
biologic aggressiveness of this variant. Similar to
prior series, the majority of patients in the current
study presented with invasive disease, and their poor
prognosis is evidenced by an overall 5-year survival
rate of only 51%, with a median survival of slightly
more than 5 years.
We have previously reported that intravesical
therapy with BCG is ineffective in patients with this
disease.4 As noted, the rate of disease progression
was 67% and occurred rapidly at a median of 8
months. The fact that patients who presented with
nonmuscle-invasive micropapillary bladder cancer
were found to have an OS rate that was no better
than that of patients who presented with more
advanced disease suggests that the presence of
micropapillary histology overshadows the apparent
nonmalevolence of the absence of muscle invasion.
Therefore, we currently offer immediate radical cystectomy to all patients who present with micropapillary bladder cancer, unless certain extenuating
circumstances make bladder preservation and the
avoidance of radical surgery necessary.
The OS rate for patients undergoing radical cystectomy in the current series was 71% at 5 years
and 53% at 10 years, with a median survival of 85
months. The aggressive nature of this disease is evidenced by the incidence of pathologic upstaging, despite our practice of performing a diligent exam
under anesthesia (EUA).5 In fact, in patients undergoing cystectomy without neoadjuvant chemotherapy, this incidence was as high as 75%, with a 38%

Micropapillary Bladder Carcinoma/Kamat et al.

incidence of occult lymph node disease. Akin to its
counterparts in other organ sites, micropapillary
tumors of the bladder are associated with a rapid
growth rate and the 75% incidence of upstaging
reported in the current study might reflect this phenomenon. Our experience suggests that, once a diagnosis of micropapillary bladder cancer has been
made, every attempt should be made to facilitate an
expeditious radical cystectomy.
The role of chemotherapy in the treatment of
patients with micropapillary bladder cancer remains
to be elucidated. We observed a 5-year OS rate of
63% in 23 patients treated with preoperative chemotherapy followed by cystectomy, a finding that was
not significantly different from that observed for the
32 patients treated with initial cystectomy, who had
a 5-year OS rate of 71%. However, it is interesting to
note that, in patients who had nonmuscle-invasive
disease, delaying surgery for neoadjuvant therapy
demonstrated a trend toward a decreased median
survival (39.9 months vs survival not attainted at the
time of last follow-up) and 5-year survival rate (49%
vs 87%; P ¼ .06) compared to upfront surgery. In
other organ sites, micropapillary carcinoma appears
to be less responsive to chemotherapy. For example,
chemotherapy prior to surgical intervention for
recurrent micropapillary serous ovarian carcinoma is
associated with a trend toward a worse survival and
a lower likelihood of optimal secondary cytoreduction.7 However, it must be recognized that although
there was no significant difference noted in T classification between the 2 groups in the current series,
there was a larger proportion of patients with
lymphovascular invasion noted in the neoadjuvant
chemotherapy group. Although the presence of lymphovascular invasion was not found to be an independent predictor of survival in the current series
(P ¼ .51), this might be 1 explanation for the apparent lack of survival benefit from the addition of
neoadjuvant chemotherapy observed in our analysis.
Nonetheless, although our experience with other variants of bladder cancer (such as small cell carcinoma
of the bladder) clearly suggest a benefit to neoadjuvant chemotherapy,8 this does not appear to be true
of the micropapillary variant of bladder cancer. As
such, in situations in which the benefits of neoadjuvant chemotherapy are less than clear (eg, no lymphovascular invasion), patients should proceed to
undergo radical cystectomy. One can then use the

67

pathologic stage to provide valuable prognostic information.9
We acknowledge certain inherent weaknesses of
a single-center retrospective report such as ours.
Results could have been affected by biases in the
selection of patients for various therapies, by leadtime bias in terms of time elapsed from the time of
initial diagnosis to definitive therapy, by the wide
range of follow-up periods noted in the patients with
this rare disease, or by other unknown variables
including variations in surveillance strategies used by
the referring physicians.

Conclusions
Micropapillary bladder cancer is associated with a
poor prognosis. Intravesical therapy appears to be
ineffective in patients with this disease. Radical cystectomy provides a chance of cure in these patients
and patients with surgically resectable disease should
proceed to expeditious radical cystectomy.
