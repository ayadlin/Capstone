Abstract
The taccalonolides are a class of structurally and mechanistically distinct microtubule-stabilizing agents isolated from
Tacca chantrieri. A crucial feature of the taxane family of
microtubule stabilizers is their susceptibility to cellular
resistance mechanisms including overexpression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), multidrug resistance protein 7 (MRP7), and the
BIII isotype of tubulin. The ability of four taccalonolides, A, E,
B, and N, to circumvent these multidrug resistance mechanisms was studied. Taccalonolides A, E, B, and N were effective
in vitro against cell lines that overexpress Pgp and MRP7.
In addition, taccalonolides A and E were highly active in vivo
against a doxorubicin- and paclitaxel-resistant Pgp-expressing
tumor, Mam17/ADR. An isogenic HeLa-derived cell line that
expresses the BIII isotype of tubulin was generated to evaluate
the effect of BIII-tubulin on drug sensitivity. When compared
with parental HeLa cells, the BIII-tubulin–overexpressing
cell line was less sensitive to paclitaxel, docetaxel, epothilone
B, and vinblastine. In striking contrast, the BIII-tubulin–
overexpressing cell line showed greater sensitivity to all four
taccalonolides. These data cumulatively suggest that the
taccalonolides have advantages over the taxanes in their
ability to circumvent multiple drug resistance mechanisms.
The ability of the taccalonolides to overcome clinically
relevant mechanisms of drug resistance in vitro and in vivo
confirms that the taccalonolides represent a valuable addition to the family of microtubule-stabilizing compounds with
clinical potential. [Cancer Res 2008;68(21):8881–8]

Introduction
Some of the most clinically effective antitumor drugs developed
over the past 25 years are those that target cellular microtubules
(1). Microtubule-targeting drugs are often classified as microtubule
stabilizers, which include the taxanes and epothilones, or
destabilizers, represented by the Vinca alkaloids and combretastatin A4. These designations, stabilizer or destabilizer, refer to the
ability of these drugs to cause striking changes in the microtubule
structures of interphase cells. The extensive work of Jordan and

Wilson showed that at lower, clinically relevant concentrations,
microtubule stabilizers and microtubule destabilizers have the
same general mechanism of action: They inhibit microtubule
dynamics leading to apoptosis (2, 3).
Paclitaxel and docetaxel are taxanes that effectively treat breast,
ovarian, prostate, and non–small-cell lung cancers (1, 4, 5).
Although the taxanes are arguably some of the most valuable
chemotherapeutic agents available today, intrinsic and acquired
drug resistance limit their anticancer actions. The identification of
new microtubule stabilizers that can overcome taxane resistance
mechanisms could provide significant breakthroughs in the
treatment of cancer (6). The search for new classes of
microtubule-targeting agents has been successful, and the
epothilones and discodermolide have been evaluated in the clinic.
In October 2007, ixabepilone (Ixempra) was the first epothilone
approved for the treatment of multidrug-resistant breast cancer
(7). Discodermolide was evaluated in a phase I trial but failed to
advance due to lung toxicity (8). Other chemically diverse classes
of microtubule stabilizers, including the laulimalides, peloruside A,
and the taccalonolides, have potential to be useful in cancer
therapy.
We previously discovered the taccalonolides, a unique class of
microtubule stabilizers that are highly acetylated steroids isolated
from the tropical plant Tacca chantrieri (9). In cells, the effects of
the taccalonolides (taccas) are almost identical to the effects of the
taxanes. The most abundant taccalonolides isolated, A and E
(taccas A and E), cause an increase in the density of interphase
microtubules and shift cellular tubulin to the polymerized form.
Consistent with the effects of other microtubule stabilizers, the
taccas induce the formation of abnormal mitotic spindles leading
to mitotic arrest, Bcl-2 phosphorylation, and initiation of apoptosis
(9). However, certain findings indicate that the taccas have a
different mechanism of action as compared with other microtubule
stabilizers (10). Unlike other compounds that are able to exert
taxane-like effects in cells, the taccas do not robustly stimulate the
polymerization of purified bovine brain tubulin or microtubule
protein (10). Further studies indicate that the taccas do not bind to
the taxane-binding site of tubulin (10). Studies are ongoing to
identify the cellular binding site of the taccas and the mechanism
of their antimitotic activity.
A significant proportion of cancer cell lines and tumors are
multidrug resistant due to expression of ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) transporters. These transporters have multiple physiologic
roles, including the capacity to extrude xenobiotics from cells in an
ATP-dependent manner. The MDR1 gene product P-glycoprotein
(Pgp; ABCB1) functions in the cellular export of a wide spectrum

of compounds, including complex natural products such as the
taxanes (11). Expression of Pgp in tissues such as the intestinal
tract, liver, and kidney contributes to the intrinsic taxane resistance
of epithelial tumors derived from these tissues. In cells selected
in vitro and in vivo for resistance to agents including the taxanes,
up-regulation of Pgp expression often leads to diminished
intracellular drug accumulation and attenuated cytotoxic effects
(11, 12). Tumors in genetic murine models of breast cancer
(Brca 1 / , p53 / ) that are initially sensitive to doxorubicin and
docetaxel develop resistance following exposure to these drugs,
which is attributable to expression of Pgp (13, 14). Clinically,
expression of Pgp in both hematologic and solid tumors has
been reported to be associated with poor treatment response and
subsequent treatment failure (12, 15–17). The overwhelming lack
of success of Pgp inhibitors in the clinic indicates that the
identification of agents that are not susceptible to Pgp-mediated
resistance will be a crucial feature of new microtubule stabilizers
(6, 12). Hence, the anticancer efficacy of ixabepilone in multidrugresistant breast cancer might relate to its ability to circumvent
export by Pgp. Our previous work using the multidrug-resistant
NCI/ADR cell line suggested that taccas A and E are not transported by Pgp (9). In this study, we further explore the efficacy
of the taccas in cells transduced with a Pgp-expression vector
compared with an isogenic parental cell line.
In addition to Pgp, other resistance factors may affect the
efficacy of microtubule-targeting agents. Expression of the ABC
transporter multidrug resistance protein 7 (MRP7; ABCC10) has
recently been identified as one such factor. MRP7 is an ABC
transporter with little structural homology to other MRP family
members, although it shares their capacity to transport amphipathic anions (18, 19). Noted substrates for MRP7 include 17hestradiol-(17-h-D-glucuronide), docetaxel, paclitaxel, vinblastine,
and vincristine (19, 20). MRP7 is normally expressed in stomach,
colon, kidney, brain, pancreas, liver, lung, ovary, and lymph nodes
and has been detected in cancer cell lines and tumor samples
(19, 21, 22). In cancer cell lines, the overexpression of MRP7 leads
to 10-fold resistance to docetaxel and lower but significant
resistance to paclitaxel and the Vinca alkaloids (20). Additionally,
MRP7 expression was found to be induced in non–small-cell lung
cancer cell lines on paclitaxel treatment. MRP7 expression levels
correlated with both paclitaxel accumulation and sensitivity (23).
These findings suggest that the ability of novel chemotherapeutic
agents to circumvent MRP7-mediated efflux may provide a significant advantage for the treatment of cancer.
Overexpression of the hIII isotype of tubulin (reviewed in ref. 24)
has been established as another clinically relevant resistance factor
for the taxanes. Microtubules are formed of polymers of a/h
heterodimers. Seven a-tubulin isotypes and nine h-tubulin isotypes
have been described, and tubulin isotype distribution is highly
tissue specific. Under normal circumstances, hIII-tubulin is found
predominantly in neuronal tissues. However, in cancer cell lines
and human tumors, the expression of hIII-tubulin has been
implicated in drug resistance to microtubule-targeting drugs
including the taxanes (24). Additionally, expression of hIII is often
observed in cell lines made resistant to the taxanes by serial drug
exposure (24). Incorporation of hIII into microtubules decreases
microtubule dynamics (25), and the removal of hIII from bovine
brain tubulin results in microtubules that are more dynamic and
more sensitive to paclitaxel (26). Inducible expression of hIIItubulin has also been shown to diminish the ability of paclitaxel to
inhibit microtubule dynamics in cells (27). Depletion of hIII by

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (21). November 1, 2008

siRNA-mediated knockdown increases the sensitivity of cell lines
to microtubule binding agents, further showing the link between
hIII-tubulin expression and drug resistance (28).
Clinically, a number of studies indicate that the expression of the
hIII isotype is associated with a lack of response to taxanes and
poor clinical prognosis (24). In four clinical trials of non–small-cell
lung cancer, the expression of hIII-tubulin was associated with
resistance to a therapeutic regimen that included a taxane or
vinorelbine, but not gemcitabine/cisplatin–based therapy (24). The
correlation between high hIII-tubulin levels and resistance to
taxane-based therapies has also been shown in ovarian, breast,
and gastric cancers, suggesting that the expression of this tubulin
isotype might be a predictive marker for the success or failure of
tubulin-targeting therapies.
Multidrug resistance is clearly multifactorial and often limits the
success of chemotherapy. It is clear that alterations in the h-tubulin
isotype composition and expression of specific ABC transporters,
including MRP7 and Pgp, can lead to resistance to the microtubulestabilizing drugs currently in clinical use. The successes and failures
of the taxanes have prompted intense drug discovery efforts to
find new classes of microtubule stabilizers. Here, we characterize
the activity of the taccas in a variety of taxane-resistant cell lines
and one murine tumor. We show that the taccas are not susceptible
to multidrug resistance associated with overexpression of Pgp,
MRP7, or the hIII-tubulin isotype. These findings indicate that
taccas may have advantages over other microtubule-targeting
agents and support their future preclinical evaluation.

Materials and Methods
Isolation and chemical modification of the taccalonolides. Taccas A
and E were isolated from the roots and rhizomes of T. chantrieri. The plant
material was washed free of dirt, frozen, and lyophilized. The freeze-dried
material was ground to a fine powder and extracted with CO2 and methanol
using a supercritical fluid extractor. Nonpolar lipids were removed by
hexane extraction. The taccas were further enriched by extraction with
dichloromethane and water and the resultant fraction was dried by
evaporation. The crude tacca extract was fractionated by flash chromatography on a silica column with hexanes and isopropanol. High-performance
liquid chromatography was used to separate taccas A and E. A preparative
Waters Resolve silica column was used initially and was followed by highperformance liquid chromatography using a semipreparative column.
Isopropanol and isooctane solvent mixtures were used for high-performance liquid chromatography. Taccas B and N were generated by treating
taccas A and E, respectively, with mild base hydrolysis as described
previously (29). The chemical identification of the individual taccalonolides
was confirmed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance.
Cell culture. HeLa, SK-OV-3, MDA-MB-435, and NCI/ADR cell lines were
obtained and grown as previously described (9). The SK-OV-3-MDR-1 cell
line, which was generated from SK-OV-3 cells by adenoviral-mediated
expression of MDR1, was obtained from Dr. Susan Kane (Division of
Molecular Medicine, Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope, Duarte,
CA; ref. 30). The SK-OV-3-MDR-1 cells were subcloned by limiting dilution
techniques to isolate single-cell clones. The clone used in these studies was
designated SK-OV-3-MDR-1-6/6. HEK293 cells and isogenic MPR7-expressing clones were isolated and maintained as previously described (19). A
single-cell clone from transfection of HeLa cells with hIII-tubulin, designated
wild-type hIII, was constructed and maintained as described (31).
Indirect immunofluorescence. HeLa and wild-type hIII cells were
grown on glass coverslips for 2 d, after which cellular microtubules and
mitotic spindles were evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence techniques
as previously described (9). Images were acquired by digital camera and
colorized and compiled using MetaMorph software.
Inhibition of cell proliferation. The sulforhodamine B assay was used
to evaluate the antiproliferative effects of microtubule-disrupting drugs

in the SKOV-3 and HeLa cell line pairs (32, 33). The concentration that
causes 50% inhibition of proliferation (IC50) after 48 h of treatment was
calculated as previously described (9) in three independent experiments,
each using triplicate points, with at least seven drug concentrations that
span the entire range of growth inhibition. The drug sensitivity of the
MRP7-transfected HEK293 cells was assessed with a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner
salt/phenazine methosulfate microtiter plate assay (CellTiter 96 Cell
Proliferation Assay, Promega). The cell lines were seeded in triplicate at
3,000 cells per well in 96-well plates in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine
serum. The next day, the cells were treated with various drug concentrations. Colorimetric analyses were done after 72 h of growth in the
presence of drug. Relative resistance values (R r) were calculated by dividing
the IC50 of the transfected or transduced cell line by the IC50 obtained in the
parental cell line.
Immunoblot analysis. HeLa and wild-type hIII cells in log-phase growth
were harvested, and cellular protein was isolated using Cell Extraction
Buffer (Invitrogen) in the presence of protease inhibitors. Protein
concentrations were measured and equal amounts of total cellular protein
were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes that were probed with monoclonal h-tubulin isotype antibodies
specific for hI-tubulin (SAP.4G5), hII-tubulin (JDR.3B8), hIII-tubulin
(SDL.3D10), and hIV-tubulin (ONS.1A6; ref. 34), as previously reported (31).
In vivo studies. The antitumor activities of taccas A and E were evaluated
in the doxorubicin- and paclitaxel-resistant syngeneic Mam17/ADR model as
previously described (35). All mice were obtained from the National Cancer
Institute (NCI)-Frederick Animal Production Program, maintained in an
Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care–
approved facility (Wayne State University, Detroit, MI) and given food and
water ad libitum. On day 0, tumor fragments (30–50 mg) were bilaterally
implanted s.c. in 8-wk-old female C3H mice. Mice were then randomly
placed into various treatment and control groups (n = 5 mice per group).
Mice had a mean 25 g body weight at the start of treatment. All drugs were
administered by i.v. bolus injections. Taccalonolides were injected in a
volume of 0.2 mL/injection as a solution diluted with cyclodextrin from 18
mg/mL liquid stocks [65:35 (v/v) DMSO/Cremophor EL, pH 7.0]. Doxorubicin
(Adriamycin) and paclitaxel (Taxol; Mead-Johnson) were diluted appropriately with USP grade water from clinical grade stocks. Mice were observed
and weighed daily before treatment, and tumors were measured two to three
times weekly by caliper. Tumor mass was calculated using the following

formula: mass (mg) = [length (mm)  width (mm)2]/2. Efficacy was assessed
using multiple end points as follows: (a) T/C, defined as median tumor mass
of treated group divided by the median tumor mass of the nontreated
control and expressed as percent; growth inhibition is the inverse of T/C.
(b) Tumor growth delay (or T-C), where T is defined as the median time in
days required for treatment group tumors to reach 1,000 mg and C is the
median time for the control group tumors to reach the same size. (c) Tumor
cell kill, defined as (T-C)/[(Td)(3.32)]; Td is the tumor volume doubling
time in days of the control tumors, which was estimated from the best-fit
straight line from a log-linear growth plot of the control group tumors in
exponential growth (range, 100–800 mg; ref. 36).

Results
Isolation and chemical modification of the taccalonolides.
A number of different approaches have been used to extract
and purify the taccalonolides from the roots and rhizomes of
T. chantrieri. In previous studies, we performed large-scale solvent
extractions followed by high-performance liquid chromatography
purification and preparative TLC to separate taccas A and E (9).
In the present study, we used a supercritical fluid extractor with a
solvent modifier followed by flash chromatography separations and
high-performance liquid chromatography purifications to isolate
taccas A and E (Fig. 1). Taccas A and E were each modified at the
C15 position by mild base hydrolysis as initially described by Chen
and colleagues (29) to generate taccas B and N, respectively (Fig. 1).
The taccas are not susceptible to Pgp-mediated multidrug
resistance in vitro. The susceptibility of taccas A, E, B, and N to
Pgp-mediated multidrug resistance in vitro was analyzed using
SK-OV-3/MDR-1-6/6, an ovarian cancer cell line transduced with an
MDR1 expression vector (30). The activity of Pgp in this cell line
was confirmed using paclitaxel, an established substrate of the
transporter, as well as 2-methoxyestradiol and epothilone B, drugs
that are not Pgp substrates (6, 37). As expected, SK-OV-3/MDR-1-6/
6 exhibited robust resistance to paclitaxel (860-fold), whereas only
very modest levels of resistance were observed for 2-methoxyestradiol and epothilone B (2.6- and 6.8-fold, respectively; Table 1).

*IC50 values were determined in each of the cell lines from a graph of at least seven drug concentrations that span the entire curve of growth inhibition
as means of 3-4 independent experiments F SD.
cRelative resistance values were calculated by dividing the IC50 obtained in the SK-OV-3/MDR-1-6/6 cell line by the IC50 measured in the parental
SK-OV-3 cell line.

These data indicate that the major mechanism of resistance
in the SK-OV-3/MDR-1-6/6 cell line is Pgp, but that a low level of
resistance might be observed even with drugs that are not
substrates of Pgp. By comparison with paclitaxel, SK-OV-3/MDR1-6/6 exhibited modest resistance toward the taccas. Relative
resistance values of 4.1, 12, 5.1, and 6.1, respectively, were observed
for taccas A, B, E, and N (Table 1). Our results suggest that all four
taccalonolides are significantly better than paclitaxel at circumventing Pgp-mediated drug resistance.
Taccas A and E circumvent Pgp-mediated drug resistance
in vivo. The efficacy of taccas in Pgp-expressing cancer cell lines
led us to test their antitumor activity in a Pgp-expressing syngeneic
murine mammary adenocarcinoma model. The Mam17/ADR tumor
is a rapidly growing, metastatic tumor that is resistant to both
paclitaxel and doxorubicin, providing a rigorous test for antitumor
efficacy. As expected, paclitaxel administered at a total dose of
75 mg/kg (historic highest nontoxic total dose range, 60–90 mg/kg
for C3H mice) was inactive, resulting in only 6% growth inhibition
(94% T/C, 0.1 log kill, and 0.5 day tumor growth delay). Mice sustained a moderate 9.4% body weight loss, indicative of appropriate
dosing. Similarly, doxorubicin given at a total dose of 14.4 mg/kg
(historical highest nontoxic total dose range, 12–16 mg/kg)
produced 52% growth inhibition (48% T/C, 0.3 log kill, and 1.0 day
tumor growth delay) with a moderate 8.1% body weight loss.
Preliminary studies with a tacca A– and tacca E–enriched crude
preparation showed that the taccas had in vivo potency in the same
dose range as paclitaxel, much lower than was anticipated from
their in vitro potency (data not shown). Taccas A and E were used
for the efficacy trials described here. Tacca A had excellent
antitumor activity when given at a total dose of 38 mg/kg, resulting
in a 91% growth inhibition (9% T/C, 2.3 log kill, and 9 day tumor
growth delay; Fig. 2). Agents that show growth inhibition of >90%
are considered to be highly active by NCI standards, and this level
of antitumor activity is rarely achieved against the aggressive
Mam17/ADR model. Although no drug deaths occurred with this
dosing schedule, a mean weight loss nadir of 25.8% occurred, a
significant toxicity, most likely due to high doses given once every
2 days. It is encouraging to note that despite the large weight loss,
these mice recovered 91.5% of their starting weights within 6 days

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (21). November 1, 2008

of nadir, indicating good host recovery potential. Another tacca A
treatment group with a 33.2 mg/kg total dose (lower individual
doses given more frequently) resulted in <2% weight loss but
provided minimal antitumor action (33% growth inhibition, 67%
T/C, 0.3 log kill, and 1 day tumor growth delay). These results
show that tacca A has excellent dose- and timing-dependent
antitumor potential against a highly drug resistant model.
Tacca E, with a total dose of 86 mg/kg, also provided excellent
antitumor activity with 91% growth inhibition (9% T/C, 1.5 log kill,
and 6 day tumor growth delay; Fig. 2). A maximal weight loss of
12.6% occurred with treatment, with 95% weight recovery within
7 days of nadir. The antitumor efficacy of tacca E also seemed
to be dose dependent because equivalent total dosing on a less

intense schedule resulted in diminished antitumor effects (data
not shown). These initial studies show that taccas A and E have
excellent antitumor effects in this multidrug-resistant Pgp murine
tumor model and that tacca E might be better tolerated than
tacca A. Further refinement of dose and schedule of administration will be important factors to optimize antitumor effects and
reduce toxicities for both taccas A and E.
The taccas overcome resistance due to MRP7 expression.
We next analyzed the ability of the taccas to circumvent resistance
due to overexpression of the ABC transporter MRP7. Two HEK293
cell lines in which MRP7 was ectopically expressed (HEK-MRP7C17 and HEK-MRP7-C18) and control cells transfected with
parental vector (HEK-pcDNA3) were used for this analysis. In
accord with a previous report (20), HEK-MRP7-C17 and HEKMRP7-C18 exhibited robust resistance to docetaxel (8.7- and 7.2fold resistance; Table 2). In contrast, minimal resistance was
observed for tacca A (1.4- and 1.3-fold resistance; Table 2). In the
case of taccas B, E, and N, the MRP7-transfected cells were actually
more sensitive compared with the parental control cells. Although
there were some minor differences, the four taccalonolides had
similar potency in HEK293 cells whether or not MRP7 was overexpressed. These findings provide evidence that taccalonolides A,
E, B, and N are able to circumvent MRP7-mediated drug resistance,
suggesting a potential advantage over the taxanes in the treatment
of tumors expressing MRP7.
The taccalonolides overcome BIII-tubulin–mediated drug
resistance. To test the effect of hIII-tubulin expression on the
activity of the taccas, we generated a HeLa-derived cell line that
ectopically expresses the human bIII-tubulin gene, referred to as
wild-type hIII (34). The HeLa and wild-type hIII cell line pair
provides the ability to test isogenic cell lines for the effect of hIIItubulin expression on drug sensitivity. Others have reported that
the expression of h-tubulin isotypes in Chinese hamster ovary cells
can reduce cell viability (38). However, we found that the growth
rate of the wild-type hIII cell line was essentially identical to the
parental HeLa cell line (data not shown).
As shown in Fig. 3A, expression of hIII-tubulin was readily
detected in wild-type hIII cells but was not detected to any extent
in the parental HeLa cell line. Expression of hIII-tubulin did not
result in alterations in the expression levels of other tubulin
isotopes in that hI-, hII-, and hIV-tubulins were expressed at
equivalent levels in HeLa and wild-type hIII cells (Fig. 3A).
Although hII- and hIV-tubulins were not detected in either cell

line, they were found in phosphocellulose-purified tubulin preparations at relative levels that were consistent with previously
published findings (refs. 39, 40; Supplementary Fig. S1). The
expression and localization of the hIII-tubulin isotype in HeLa and
wild-type hIII cells was examined by immunofluorescence. Consistent with the immunoblot data, hIII-tubulin was not detected
in either interphase microtubules (Supplementary Fig. S2) or
mitotic spindles (Fig. 3B) of HeLa cells. However, in wild-type hIII
cells, hIII-tubulin was observed in cytoplasmic interphase microtubules (Supplementary Fig. S2) and in the mitotic spindle of
dividing cells (Fig. 3B). Aurora A, a kinase localized to centrosomes
and the mitotic spindle, was used to visualize mitotic spindle
structures independently of hIII-tubulin expression. The extensive
overlap of hIII and Aurora A in wild-type hIII cells substantiated
the conclusion that hIII-tubulin was correctly localized to the
mitotic spindle. In addition, chromosomes were appropriately
oriented in the metaphase plate in both HeLa and wild-type hIII
cells (Fig. 3B). In combination, these experiments indicate that hIIItubulin was properly localized to microtubules in both interphase
and dividing wild-type hIII cells, and that this expression of hIIItubulin did not affect either cell growth or the apparent function of
the mitotic spindle. The incorporation of hIII into the mitotic
spindle structures is of paramount importance because it is the
ability of microtubule-disrupting drugs to interfere with mitotic
events that underlies their antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects.
The HeLa and wild-type hIII pair of isogenic cell lines was used
to analyze the effect of hIII-tubulin expression on the activity of a
variety of microtubule-stabilizing and destabilizing drugs. These
included drugs that bind to the taxane binding site: paclitaxel,
docetaxel, and epothilone B; colchicine-site binding agents:
colchicine, combretastatin A4 phosphate, and 2-methoxyestradiol;
and the vinca domain binding drug vinblastine. The wild-type hIII
cells were 4.7-, 6.9-, and 2.3-fold resistant to paclitaxel, docetaxel,
and epothilone B, respectively, as compared with the HeLa cell line
(Table 3; Supplementary Fig. S3A). The hIII-expressing cells were
also 3-fold more resistant to vinblastine (Table 3). Interestingly, the
two cell lines were equally sensitive to drugs that bind within the
colchicine binding site on tubulin (Table 3).
The sensitivity of the two cells lines to the taccas was also
evaluated. The hIII-expressing cell line reproducibly showed
sensitivity to the taccas as compared with the parental HeLa cell
line, suggesting that incorporation of the hIII isotype of tubulin
into mitotic spindles does not confer resistance to the taccas

Figure 3. hIII-tubulin expression confers resistance to paclitaxel and sensitivity to the taccalonolides. A, lysates were prepared from HeLa and isogenic
wild-type hIII-tubulin–expressing cells (WTbIII ). Tubulin isotype expression was analyzed by immunoblotting with isotype-specific antibodies. Immunodetection of
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a control for equivalent loading and transfer of total protein between the two cell lines. B, mitotic spindles
containing hIII-tubulin (green ) or Aurora A (red) were visualized alone or as merged images with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole nuclear staining (blue ) by indirect
immunofluorescence in HeLa and wild-type hIII cells. The sulforhodamine B assay was used to define the dose-response curves of paclitaxel (C ) or taccas E and N (D )
in HeLa and wild-type hIII cells. Points, mean of three independent experiments for each drug concentration; bars, SE.

(Table 3). Dose-response curves suggest that hIII-expressing wildtype hIII cells are less sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of
paclitaxel and more sensitive to taccas E, N, and B (Fig. 3C and D;
Supplementary Fig. S3). These results suggest that the taccalonolides may have a unique niche as microtubule stabilizers that
circumvent hIII-tubulin–mediated drug resistance.

Discussion
Drug resistance is clearly multifactorial, and the identification of
new drugs that can circumvent multiple resistance mechanisms
would be beneficial. In the present study, we analyze the susceptibility of the taccas to several established resistance factors to
gain insights into their potential clinical utility. Our finding that the
taccas are effective in vitro and in vivo against Pgp-expressing
tumor cells and in vitro against MRP7 and hIII-tubulin–expressing

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (21). November 1, 2008

cell lines indicates that the taccas may offer advantages over wellestablished microtubule-targeting agents. Additionally, taccas A
and E do not seem to bind to tubulin (10), providing an additional
advantage in that mutations in the taxane binding site do not
cause resistance to the taccas (9). The unique mechanism of action
of the taccalonolides may prove valuable not only in overcoming
resistance but also in acting in concert with tubulin-binding
microtubule stabilizers to initiate mitotic arrest leading to
apoptosis. This hypothesis will be tested in future studies.
Although the taccas clearly circumvent many drug resistance
mechanisms, they are significantly less potent than other
microtubule stabilizers in drug-sensitive cell lines. In this context,
it is important to remember that anticancer drugs are often used at
their maximally tolerated dose. Therefore, even slight dose
increases of very potent drugs in resistant tumors are prohibitive.
Our in vitro results show that the taccalonolides are effective

Taccalonolides Circumvent Multidrug Resistance

against taxane-resistant cell lines at concentrations comparable to
(or even less than) those used in sensitive lines, suggesting the
possibility that the taccas may be effective against resistant tumors
in vivo at tolerated doses. Indeed, we found that a concentration of
tacca E essentially equal to the maximum tolerated dose of
paclitaxel was effective against an aggressive multidrug-resistant
tumor. Therefore, whereas taccas A, B, E, and N are less potent
than the taxanes in many cell lines, their enhanced efficacy in
clinically relevant, multidrug-resistant tumors makes them attractive drug candidates.
Having four distinct taccalonolides allows us to gain insight on
the importance of molecular structure as it affects function. For
instance, the hydrolysis of the C15 acetyl significantly increases
potency as evidenced by at least a 3-fold decrease in the IC50
value of taccas B and N compared with taccas A and E in nearly
every cell line tested. Identification of additional naturally
occurring taccalonolides, along with further chemical modification of those already isolated, should provide further insight into
what chemical moieties are important for optimal antimitotic
actions. The presence of the C11 acetate group makes little
difference in tacca potency in vitro, as shown by the similar IC50
values of taccas A and E in several cell types. However, this
difference seems to have a significant effect in vivo against an
aggressive Pgp-expressing tumor. Additionally, our data indicate
that, in vivo, taccas A and E are substantially more potent than
would be expected from their in vitro potency. Pharmacokinetic
studies are planned.
Although the most well-established mechanism of resistance to
the taxanes is overexpression of Pgp, there are multiple lines of
evidence to suggest that up-regulation of hIII-tubulin is another
clinically relevant taxane resistance mechanism (24). However,
much of the cell line and clinical data are only correlative. The
wild-type hIII cell line provides an opportunity for a systematic
determination of resistance conferred solely by hIII-tubulin overexpression. In accordance with siRNA knockdown experiments in
established cell lines with elevated hIII-tubulin expression, we
found that hIII expression confers resistance to the microtubule

stabilizers paclitaxel, docetaxel, and epothilone B, as well as the
microtubule depolymerizer vinblastine, which bind within the
taxane and vinca domain, respectively (28). The additional finding
that hIII-tubulin overexpression has no effect on the sensitivity of
cells to three colchicine-site binding destabilizers further shows
that the mechanism of resistance conferred by hIII-tubulin
overexpression is not as simple as net microtubule stabilization
or destabilization, but may relate specifically to the tubulin/
microtubule binding site. The isogenic wild-type hIII and HeLa cell
lines will be valuable in the future to further probe these relationships. The fact that hIII expression does not cause resistance to
the taccas is not totally unexpected considering that they do not
seem to bind directly to tubulin (10). The finding that a cell line
expressing hIII is more sensitive to all four taccas than the parental
line further suggests that these agents do indeed stabilize
microtubules through a novel mechanism of action and supports
additional study of their use in taxane-resistant tumors.
There is an increasing body of evidence correlating aggressive,
non–taxane-responsive tumors with hIII-tubulin expression (24).
hIII-tubulin is not normally found in epithelial tissues, and there is
a question on why it is often expressed in tumors of epithelial
origin. A mechanistic rationale for this observation has been
missing. In contrast to most other h-tubulin isotypes, hIII-tubulin
lacks Cys239. This cysteine is very reactive, and oxidation of Cys239
has been shown to inhibit microtubule assembly (41). hIII-tubulin
has a serine at position 239, and consistent with the lower reactivity of Ser239, tubulin polymers formed of ahIII are less sensitive
to oxidizing agents including reactive oxygen species (41).
Therefore, expression of hIII could provide a mechanism to protect
microtubules from oxidative damage.
The hypoxic conditions of the tumor environment enhance
the generation of reactive oxygen species (42). A recent report
by Raspaglio and colleagues (43) showed that hIII-tubulin is
up-regulated in cells grown in hypoxic conditions and that this
expression occurred through activation of HIF-1a. Mechanistically,
this suggests that cells that express hIII-tubulin as a result of
hypoxic conditions might be better equipped to survive the high

rational molecular basis for the finding that hIII-tubulin is often
up-regulated in solid tumors that are refractory to current
