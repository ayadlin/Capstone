Abstract
Aromatase inhibitors are important drugs to treat estrogen
receptor α (ERα)–positive postmenopausal breast cancer patients. However, development of resistance to aromatase inhibitors has been observed. We examined whether the heat
shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitor 17-(dimethylaminoethylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG) can inhibit the
growth of aromatase inhibitor–resistant breast cancers and
the mechanisms by which 17-DMAG affects proliferation. Aromatase inhibitor–responsive MCF-7aro and aromatase
inhibitor–resistant LTEDaro breast epithelial cells were used
in this study. We observed that 17-DMAG inhibited proliferation in both MCF-7aro and LTEDaro cells in a dose-dependent
manner. 17-DMAG induced apoptosis and G2 cell cycle arrest
in both cell lines. Although inhibition of HSP90 decreased the
levels of ERα, the ERα transcriptional activity was not affected
when cells were treated with 17-DMAG together with estradiol. Moreover, detailed mechanistic studies suggested
that 17-DMAG inhibits cell growth via degradation of HSP90
client proteins AKT and HER2. Collectively, results from this
study provide data to support that HSP90 inhibitors may be
an effective therapy to treat aromatase inhibitor–resistant
breast cancers and that improved efficacy can be achieved
by combined use of a HSP90 inhibitor and an AKT inhibitor.

Introduction
Aromatase is the enzyme that converts androgen into estrogen.
Estrogen is known to play an important role in breast cancer
growth through its activation of the estrogen receptor α (ERα). Activated ERα can then translocate into the nucleus where it can
bind to estrogen response elements on various gene promoters
and subsequently transactivate these genes, which are involved
in promoting tumor cell growth (1). Tamoxifen, an antagonist of
ERα, and aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane), which inhibit the synthesis of estrogens, have been effective
therapies to combat estrogen-dependent breast cancer (2–4). However, resistance to these inhibitors has been observed. How resistance to these therapies develops as well as the mechanisms of
how these cells survive and proliferate in the presence of these
inhibitors are not completely understood. Studies of aromatase

inhibitor and tamoxifen resistance have revealed an important role
of the ERα in the acquisition of resistance. In the long-term
estrogen-deprived (LTEDaro) cells, a model of aromatase inhibitor resistance, and other aromatase inhibitor–resistant cells,
ERα was found to be constitutively active (5). Moreover, it is
thought that this ERα activity is dependent on growth factor
pathway signaling that is responsible for activation and influencing the levels of ERα in aromatase inhibitor–resistant breast
cancers in a ligand-independent manner (6, 7). Growth factor–
upregulated kinases can phosphorylate ERα and activate it,
leading to transcriptional activation of target genes and signaling pathways involved in growth (6–12).
Heat shock proteins (HSP) are chaperone proteins that correctly
fold and assist proteins in the active, correct conformations. They
are involved in stress response and also in assembly and transportation across different cell compartments (13, 14). HSP90 is the
most abundant protein in cells, comprising ∼1% to 2% of the total
soluble cytosolic protein (15). HSPs are expressed in normal cells
but are overexpressed in cancer cells (16). Many HSP client proteins are involved in processes such as proliferation, apoptosis,
and cell cycle progression (17, 18). It is not surprising that cancer
cells exploit these HSPs to correctly fold client proteins to further
the growth and survival of the cancer cells. Due to the importance
of these HSPs in the growth and survival of cancer cells, inhibitors
against these proteins have been developed. Early version of inhibitors against HSP90 include geldanamycin and its synthetic derivative, 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (19–22). Due
to their toxicity and low solubility, another HSP90 inhibitor, 17(dimethylaminoethylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG),
was developed. 17-DMAG displays better water solubility and oral
bioavailability and has been tested in phase I clinical trials for
treatment of metastatic or unresectable tumors or lymphomas
(23, 24). Although HSP90 is expressed in both normal and cancer
cells, HSP90 inhibitors display preference for cancerous cells (25).
Furthermore, due to the wide range of protein targets HSP90 affects, its inhibitors can be useful for treating cancer, such as aromatase inhibitor–resistant breast cancers that are thought to rely
heavily on growth factor signaling pathways, which include many
HSP90 client proteins. However, to date, the efficacy of 17-DMAG
on aromatase inhibitor therapy-resistant breast cancers has not
been examined. The purpose of this study is to determine whether
17-DMAG may be used as a therapy to treat aromatase inhibitor–
resistant breast cancers and to study how it alters molecular
properties of aromatase inhibitor–resistant breast cancer cells.
Here, we show that nanomolar concentrations of 17-DMAG
can inhibit both aromatase inhibitor–responsive and aromatase
inhibitor–resistant breast cancer cell growth by inducing apoptosis as well as arresting the cell cycle at the G2 phase. We also
show that 17-DMAG has no effect on the ERα transcriptional
activity in the aromatase inhibitor–responsive and aromatase
inhibitor–resistant breast cells in the presence of hormone. This
suggests that the mechanism of 17-DMAG inhibition of breast cell

proliferation functions independently of the ERα signaling pathway.
Instead, we found that HSP90 client proteins, AKT and HER2, are
involved in the growth of both aromatase inhibitor–responsive and
aromatase inhibitor–resistant breast cancer cell lines, suggesting
that 17-DMAG–mediated inhibition of growth may result from inhibition of these signaling pathways. The data suggest that HSP90
inhibitors will be a suitable therapy for breast cancers that have
developed resistance to current aromatase inhibitor therapies.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and cell culture. The human MCF-7 breast epithelial-derived
cell lines MCF-7aro and LTEDaro were generated previously in this laboratory and have been reported (5, 26). Human mammary epithelial cells (Lonza) were cultured in MEGM medium supplemented with bovine pituitary
extract, human epidermal growth factor, hydrocortisone, gentamicin sulfate and amphotericin B, and insulin.
Reagents and antibodies. 17-DMAG was from the Drug Synthesis and
Chemistry Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Program, National Cancer
Institute, and dissolved in DMSO. Exemestane was from Pharmacia & Upjohn. Triciribine was from Cayman Chemical and AG825 was from Calbiochem. MTT compound was from Sigma-Aldrich. The antibody to HSP90
was from Stressgen Bioreagents; the antibodies to phospho-HER2 and
HER2 were from Upstate; the antibodies to phospho-ERα Ser118, cleaved
poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), cyclin D1, and AKT were from Cell
Signaling Technology; the antibody to ERα was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; and the antibody to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
was from Chemicon.
Cell proliferation assay. MCF-7aro cells were hormone-deprived for 1
day before plating. MCF-7aro, LTEDaro, and human mammary epithelial
cells were cultured in 96-well plates at a concentration of 1.5 × 103 to
4 × 103 per well (200 μL/well). Cells were treated with DMSO or inhibitor
for up to 3 days and MCF-7aro cells were additionally treated with
1 nmol/L testosterone. Cell viability was assessed by the MTT assay.
Briefly, the MTT powder was dissolved in cell culture medium to a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. MTT reagent (150 μL) was added to each well
and incubated for 1 h at 37°C, 5% CO2. DMSO was added to solubilize the
formazan product and formazan absorbance was measured at 570 nm on
a SpectraMax M5 microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Three replicates
were used for each measurement and the mean and SD were calculated.
Apoptosis analysis. Cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 per 60 mm
dish. After 24 h, either DMSO or 100 nmol/L 17-DMAG was added to the
dishes, in addition to 1 nmol/L testosterone for MCF-7aro cells, and the
cells were cultured for 48 or 72 h. To detect apoptotic cell death, DNA fragmentation was detected using Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Cell cycle analysis. Cells were plated on 100 cm dishes at a density of
1 × 106 per dish. DMSO or 100 nmol/L 17-DMAG was added to the dishes
the following day in addition to 1 nmol/L testosterone for MCF-7aro cells.
At each time point, 2 × 106 cells were collected, resuspended in 1 mL cold
PBS, and fixed by the addition of 4 mL of −20°C absolute ethanol. The fixed
cells were resuspended in 500 μL PBS/0.1% bovine serum albumin and
200 μg/mL DNase-free RNase A (100 μL) was added. After incubation at
37°C for 30 min, 1 mg/mL propidium iodide (50 μL) was added to the cells
and allowed to incubate for at least 1 h before analysis by a CyAn ADP
9 color flow cytometer (DAKO).
ER functional assays. MCF-7aro and LTEDaro cells were plated in 12well plates at 1 × 105 per well. The following day, each well was transfected
with 1 μg pGL3-(ERE)3 reporter using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 5 h, transfection medium was replaced with medium with or without
1 nmol/L E2 and 100 nmol/L 17-DMAG. After 48 h, the firefly luciferase
activity was measured using the luciferase assay system (Promega) and a
TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs). Luciferase activity was normalized to protein concentration.
Western blot analysis. Cell monolayers were washed twice with icecold PBS and then lysed. The protein concentration was quantified by

www.aacrjournals.org

the Bradford's method. Equal amounts of protein were resolved by SDSPAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad), and detected
by using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce
Biotechnology).
Statistical analysis. The synergistic and antagonistic effect of the combination of 17-DMAG and triciribine or AG825 were analyzed using Calcusyn (Biosoft), a software program based on the Chou-Talalay method (27).

Results
LTEDaro is a model of aromatase inhibitor resistance. MCF7aro cells were generated in this laboratory as a model of aromatasepositive and ER-positive breast cancer (26). MCF-7aro cells were
continuously cultured in steroid-depleted medium to generate
LTEDaro cells (5). Therefore, through the conversion to E2 by aromatase, testosterone is needed for the proliferation of MCF-7aro
cells, but LTEDaro cells grow well in the absence of testosterone.
To show that the LTEDaro cells are a model of aromatase inhibitor
resistance, we treated both MCF-7aro and LTEDaro cells with
1 μmol/L exemestane, an aromatase inhibitor, and measured cell
proliferation. MCF-7aro cells treated with 1 μmol/L exemestane
showed significant growth inhibition after 72 h of treatment
(Fig. 1). This marked sensitivity was not observed in the LTEDaro
cells, which displayed growth levels similar to the DMSO vehicle
control. This result confirms that MCF-7aro cells are aromatase
inhibitor–sensitive, whereas LTEDaro are aromatase inhibitor–
resistant. The LTEDaro cells have also been shown to be resistant to tamoxifen and two nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors, letrozole and anastrozole (5). Clinically, lack of cross-resistance
among different aromatase inhibitors is typically observed, that
is, patients will respond partially to a second aromatase inhibitor
after acquiring resistance to the first aromatase inhibitor. Therefore, we believe the LTEDaro cell line is representative of the last
stage of resistance because these cells no longer respond to any of
the aromatase inhibitors. Thus, LTEDaro is valuable to test for new
drugs that can overcome aromatase inhibitor resistance.
17-DMAG inhibits cell growth in aromatase inhibitor–
resistant epithelial breast cancer cells. It has been shown that
breast cancer cells that become aromatase inhibitor–resistant no
longer depend on estrogen production by aromatase for growth.
Instead, the cells shift their dependence on growth factor signaling pathways for promoting aromatase inhibitor–resistant breast
cancer growth (5). We reasoned that HSP90 inhibitors might be
effective in suppressing the proliferation of aromatase inhibitor–
resistant cells because many members of growth factor signaling
pathways are HSP90 clients. To determine whether aromatase
inhibitor–responsive and aromatase inhibitor–resistant cells are
susceptible to the HSP90 inhibitor, 17-DMAG, cell proliferation assays were conducted. 17-DMAG inhibited hormone-independent
LTEDaro and hormone-dependent MCF-7aro cell growth in a
dose-dependent manner at nanomolar concentrations as well as
a time-dependent manner. At low doses (5-15 nmol/L) of 17DMAG, up to 70% growth inhibition was observed in both cell
lines. Moreover, by 72 h of treatment with 100 nmol/L 17-DMAG,
both LTEDaro (Fig. 2A) and MCF-7aro (Fig. 2B) cells were almost
completely growth-inhibited compared with the DMSO control.
Furthermore, 17-DMAG inhibited growth of exemestane-resistant
cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner (data not shown). Normal human mammary epithelial cells were treated with 17-DMAG
to test the selectivity of the drug for cancerous cells. The drug was
ineffective at low doses (5-15 nmol/L) and growth inhibition was
evident only at higher doses (≥20 nmol/L) (Fig. 2C). These results

confirmed that proliferation of aromatase inhibitor–resistant
breast cancer cells can be attenuated by HSP90 inhibitors.
Moreover, at lower doses, 17-DMAG is well tolerated by normal
cells, but it can still inhibit cancer cell growth.
17-DMAG induces apoptosis and a G2-phase arrest. The inhibition of cell proliferation could possibly occur due to either induced apoptosis, an arrest in the cell cycle, or both. To determine
whether the 17-DMAG–induced inhibition of cell growth was due
to apoptosis, we decided to detect DNA fragmentation resulting
from treatment with 100 nmol/L 17-DMAG. A 2- to 4-fold increase
in the levels of DNA fragmentation was observed in both cell lines
after 48 and 72 h of treatment (Fig. 3A and B). This result confirms
that apoptosis is induced by inhibition of HSP90.
Next, to determine whether, in addition of apoptosis, 17-DMAG
treatment causes alterations of the cell cycle, cells were treated
with 100 nmol/L 17-DMAG and analyzed by flow cytometry to
measure the population of cells in each phase of the cell cycle.
LTEDaro cells treated with 17-DMAG showed significantly higher
percentage (2- to 3-fold) of cells in G2 compared with DMSOtreated cells (Fig. 3C). Similarly, MCF-7aro cells treated with
17-DMAG displayed a decreasing population of cells in S phase
and an increase in the number of cells in G2 with each day of
treatment (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that 17-DMAG arrests
cells at the G2-M phase transition.
17-DMAG–mediated inhibition of growth does not target
the ERα pathway. Our proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle
studies revealed that 17-DMAG is effective on both hormonedependent and independent cell lines in a similar fashion. This
suggests that the mechanism by which 17-DMAG inhibits growth
does not involve ERα. To confirm this hypothesis, we analyzed the
effect of 17-DMAG on ERα levels and activity. Total ERα levels decreased with 17-DMAG treatment in a dose- and time-dependent
manner (Fig. 4A and B). These results indicate that ERα is degraded with 17-DMAG treatment and confirm that ERα is a HSP90 client protein. Next, we examined whether 17-DMAG can inhibit
the ERα transcriptional activity, a result of constitutive ligandindependent ERα phosphorylation in hormone-independent cells
or a result of ligand activation of ERα in hormone-dependent
cells. We transfected both LTEDaro and MCF-7aro cells with a
reporter plasmid encoding three ERE sequences, in tandem, upstream of the firefly luciferase gene. After transfection, the cells
were treated with medium containing either DMSO or 17-DMAG
along with or without 1 nmol/L E2. Our analysis revealed that
17-DMAG abolished ligand-independent ERα activity in LTEDaro
cells as well as the basal ERα activity in MCF-7aro cells compared with the DMSO control (Fig. 4C and D). The basal ERα

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (22). November 15, 2009

activity was high in the LTEDaro cells and was not affected
by the treatment of 1 nmol/L E2 (Fig. 4C). However, cotreatment
with E2 and 17-DMAG was unable to completely abolish the
ERα transcriptional activity (Fig. 4C). In MCF-7aro cells, as expected, E2 stimulated transcriptional activation of ERα (Fig. 4D).
Surprisingly, treatment with both E2 and 17-DMAG further enhanced the transcriptional activity of the MCF-7aro cells. These
results show that whereas 17-DMAG can abolish ERα transcriptional activity in the absence of hormone, it is unable to inhibit
this transcriptional activity in the presence of ligand. Additional
studies by Western blot analysis corroborate these results. Basal
phosphorylation of ERα at S118 was observed in DMSO and
1 nmol/L E2–treated LTEDaro cells (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Phosphorylation was abolished by 17-DMAG and total levels
of ERα also decreased indicating degradation by 17-DMAG

treatment. However, phosphorylation was restored by cotreatment with 1 nmol/L E2 and 100 nmol/L 17-DMAG (Supplementary Fig. S1). Phosphorylation of ERα at S118 was detected in
MCF-7aro cells treated with 1 nmol/L E2 but was not detected
with DMSO or 100 nmol/L 17-DMAG treatment. In addition,
total ERα was degraded by 17-DMAG treatment. These results
confirm that ERα is a HSP90 client protein in both hormonedependent and independent cells. However, 17-DMAG does not

affect ERα activity in the presence of ligand, confirming that
17-DMAG–mediated inhibition of growth does not occur by targeting of the ERα pathway.
Inhibition of HSP90 alters protein expression in epithelial

client protein expression. HSP90 expression was similar in both
MCF-7aro and LTEDaro whole-cell lysates (Fig. 5A and B). To
analyze whether apoptotic markers were activated, we checked
the expression of PARP, which is cleaved due to caspase-3 and
-7 activation (28). Levels of cleaved PARP increased with increasing concentration of 17-DMAG and with time, indicating
induction of apoptosis resulting from 17-DMAG treatment and
confirming our data that 17-DMAG induces apoptosis (Fig. 3A
and B). In addition, cyclin D1 levels also decreased with increasing concentration, indicating that fewer cells are in the G1 phase
of the cell cycle (Fig. 5A and B). These results also corroborate
our cell cycle analysis (Fig. 3C and D), which indicate an
increased population of cells in the G2 phase after 17-DMAG
treatment.
To identify other pathways that may be affected by 17-DMAG
treatment, we examined the expression levels of HSP90 client proteins after 17-DMAG treatment. We determined the levels of AKT,

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (22). November 15, 2009

phospho-HER2, and HER2, proteins that have growth-promoting
and prosurvival effects (29–31). Client proteins AKT and HER2 as
well as the phosphorylated, activated form of HER2 protein levels
decreased with increasing dose of 17-DMAG treatment and in a
time-dependent manner in the LTEDaro (Fig. 5A) and MCF-7aro
(Fig. 5B) cell lines. These results confirm that AKT and HER2 are
targeted by 17-DMAG.
AKT and HER2 pathways are important for cell growth in
the MCF-7aro and LTEDaro cell lines. Our Western blot data
suggested that the pathways by which AKT and HER2 function
may be targeted by 17-DMAG. To determine whether these pathways play an important role in the growth of the cells, we treated
both LTEDaro and MCF-7aro cells with the AKT inhibitor triciribine and the HER2 inhibitor AG825 and measured cell proliferation. Triciribine and AG825, individually, inhibited both LTEDaro
and MCF-7aro cell growth in a dose-dependent manner and were
similarly potent in both cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S2A and B).
Inhibition of growth by the AKT or HER2 inhibitors indicates the
importance of these proteins for cell growth in the aromatase
inhibitor–responsive and resistant cell lines and suggests that
these pathways may be targeted by 17-DMAG.
To test this hypothesis, we treated both LTEDaro and MCF-7aro
cells with 17-DMAG along with triciribine or AG825 and measured
growth of these cells. Triciribine, 17-DMAG, and the combination
of both inhibited LTEDaro cell growth in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Interestingly, when both inhibitors
were used in combination, statistical analysis indicated synergistic
reduction in cell growth (Table 1; Supplementary Fig. S3B). Similarly, the effect of 17-DMAG on MCF-7aro cells was synergistically
enhanced with increasing concentration of triciribine (Table 1;
Supplementary Fig. S3C and D).
Cell growth was inhibited with increasing concentration of
HER2 inhibitor, AG825, 17-DMAG, as well as the combination of
the two in both LTEDaro and MCF-7aro cell lines (Supplementary
Fig. S4A and C). Although increasing concentrations of both inhibitors resulted in increased suppression of growth, statistical analysis of these results indicated that these inhibitors work in an
antagonistic manner in both cell lines (Table 1; Supplementary
Fig. S4B and D). These results show that both AKT and HER2 pathways play a role in the growth of aromatase inhibitor–responsive
and resistant breast cancer cells, and both these pathways are targeted by 17-DMAG. However, because AKT inhibitor, triciribine,
and 17-DMAG function synergistically, they can be used in a combinatorial manner to treat aromatase inhibitor–resistant breast
cancer.

Discussion
Aromatase inhibitors are currently first-line therapies for the
treatment of postmenopausal ER-positive breast cancer patients.
However, acquired resistance to the inhibitors does develop. In
the clinical setting, patients who develop resistance to aromatase
inhibitors do not respond to current available endocrine therapies.
This creates a need for new therapies or treatment regiments that
can be used to treat these aromatase inhibitor–resistant breast
cancer patients. HSP90 inhibitors have been shown to be effective
at inhibiting the growth of various different cancers, including
breast cancer. 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin, an earlygeneration HSP90 inhibitor, has been tested on hormone-refractory
breast cancers and several tyrosine kinase inhibitor–resistant
cancers and was shown to be quite effective at inhibiting cell

proliferation (32) as well as inducing apoptosis (33, 34). The
HSP90 inhibitor 17-DMAG has been reported to inhibit proliferation and angiogenesis in pancreatic and gastric cancers by interfering with growth factor signaling (35, 36).
Aromatase inhibitor–resistant breast cancers do not rely on
hormone-mediated signaling, but growth factor signaling is important for their growth. It has been found that the ERα can be phosphorylated and activated in a ligand-independent manner. This
activation is mainly due to the cross-talk between the ERα and
growth factor signaling pathways, such as insulin-like growth
factor-I receptor and ErbB2-mediated signaling pathways. Because
these growth factor signaling proteins are important for resistance
to aromatase inhibitors and are also HSP90 client proteins, we were
interested in studying whether the HSP90 inhibitor 17-DMAG
would be an effective mode of treatment for aromatase inhibitor–
resistant breast cancer.
In this study, 17-DMAG is shown to effectively suppress cell
growth of both the aromatase inhibitor–responsive MCF-7aro cells
and the aromatase inhibitor–resistant LTEDaro cells. The dosages
used are in a submicromolar range, showing that the inhibitor is
very potent in these cells. A previous report indicated that HSP90
inhibitors display specificity toward cancerous cells (25). Our data
show that the inhibitor is ineffective at low doses in normal breast
epithelial cells. This is expected because noncancerous cells do not
overexpress HSP90 as cancerous cells do (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Thus, cancerous cells would be more susceptible to the effects of
the inhibitor at low doses. However, at higher doses, an excess of
the inhibitor would affect all HSP90 client proteins necessary for
growth, even in normal cells. This suggests that, at a certain concentration range, 17-DMAG could inhibit cancer cell growth, without affecting normal cells.
Further analysis as to how treatment with 17-DMAG leads to
inhibition of growth indicated DNA fragmentation. Confirmation
of 17-DMAG–mediated induction of apoptosis was observed by
Western blotting for cleaved PARP, which facilitates cellular disassembly and is an indicator of cells undergoing apoptosis. 17-DMAG
treatment also led to a decrease in the levels of HSP90 client proteins. HER2 protein levels decreased as well as its active phosphorylated state. Following the decreased HER2 levels, the downstream

AKT protein levels also decreased. AKT plays an important role in
the suppression of apoptosis and promotes growth. AKT has been
shown to suppress apoptosis through the phosphorylation of proapoptotic proteins, transcription factors, and regulators of transcription factors, which results in blockage of transcriptional
repression of proapoptotic genes and survival (37–39). HER2
and AKT proteins promote growth and decreased levels of these
proteins would facilitate apoptosis in the cell.
In addition to inducing apoptosis, 17-DMAG also causes cell cycle arrest at the G2-M phase. This phenomenon has been observed
in some studies (40), whereas others have detected arrest at the G1S phase (40, 41) depending on the cell line. The levels of HSP90
client proteins may differ in each cell line; thus, treatment with
the inhibitor may affect certain proteins more readily than others,
which may explain the differences among the cell lines. Cyclin D1
is needed for the progression from G1 to S phase. Although cyclin
D1 is not a HSP90 client protein, it is indirectly regulated by client
proteins. One study has described a phosphoinositide 3-kinase/
AKT regulatory mechanism to control cyclin D1 expression posttranslationally (42). AKT degradation by 17-DMAG treatment
might affect cyclin D1 expression. Decreased cyclin D1 expression
might allow cells to bypass the G1-S checkpoints and continue
through the cell cycle in an unregulated manner. We observed a
reduction in the cyclin D1 levels after 17-DMAG treatment in both
MCF-7aro and LTEDaro cells, suggesting this could be a mechanism for higher number of cells in G2 stage. Our results show that
17-DMAG inhibits cell proliferation by blocking cells at G2 stage
while also inducing cell death of the remaining cells by inhibiting
the signaling of growth promoting pathways.
17-DMAG treatment also degrades the HSP90 client protein
ERα, which is implicated in aromatase inhibitor resistance (5). Notably, total ERα protein levels and its ligand-independent phosphorylation are elevated in LTED cells compared with the
aromatase inhibitor–responsive MCF-7 cells (6, 9). However, our
data show that 17-DMAG affects both hormone-dependent MCF7aro and hormone-independent LTEDaro cells in a similar fashion.
This suggests that 17-DMAG does not inhibit both cell lines by targeting of the ERα pathway. ERα phosphorylation and activity were
unaffected when cells were treated with 17-DMAG in the presence

of E2. These results indicate that the presence of hormone has a
protective effect against the inhibition of ERα transcriptional activation by 17-DMAG in both LTEDaro and MCF-7aro cell lines. A
mechanism described to link transcription and degradation by
the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis may explain the results (43).
In the MCF-7aro cells, binding of the E2 ligand to ERα signals activation of ERα and dissociation from the HSP90 complex, thereby
bypassing 17-DMAG–mediated degradation of ERα. ERα can then
induce transcriptional activation. However, ERα is ubiquitinated
and targeted for degradation simultaneously as RNA polymerase
II elongates transcription through a transcription-coupled degradation mechanism. In the LTEDaro cells, the ERα is not stimulated
by E2; however, it may retain its ability to bind. Thus, hormone
binding may prevent ERα from being degraded with 17-DMAG
treatment, thereby restoring its activity. Despite this postulated
mechanism, how ERα transcriptional activity is elevated in the
MCF-7aro cells with 17-DMAG and hormone treatment is unclear.
More studies are required to fully understand this effect. Although
ERα is a HSP90 client protein, the reporter assay results confirm
that the ERα pathway is not a target by which 17-DMAG inhibits
cell growth.
Our results show that 17-DMAG also targets growth factor pathways to inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation. We observed degradation of both AKT and HER2 by 17-DMAG treatment in
LTEDaro and MCF-7aro cells. Additionally, AKT inhibitor triciribine and HER2 inhibitor AG825, alone, were able to inhibit growth
of both LTEDaro and MCF-7aro cells. Moreover, we found that
AG825, along with 17-DMAG, functions in an antagonistic manner,
whereas triciribine and 17-DMAG work in a synergistic manner in
both cell lines. Our data show that a combination of both 17DMAG and an AKT inhibitor may be more effective than 17-DMAG
alone in the treatment of aromatase inhibitor–resistant breast
cancers.
Aromatase inhibitors are specific and effective inhibitors for
treating aromatase inhibitor–responsive breast cancer. It is in

breast cancers that have developed resistance to aromatase inhibitors that no good treatment is available. Our results show that
the aromatase inhibitor–resistant LTEDaro cells and the aromatase inhibitor–sensitive MCF-7aro cells are growth-inhibited by
the HSP90 inhibitor 17-DMAG. 17-DMAG treatment displays potent efficacy in inhibiting breast cancer cell growth. It displays selectivity toward cancer cells at lower doses and displays some
cytotoxicity toward normal cells only at higher doses. Currently,
HSP90 inhibitors are continually being developed for improved potency and selectivity and these drugs remain to be tested. However, the importance of this study is to show the utility of HSP90
inhibitors as a potential therapy for the treatment of aromatase
inhibitor–resistant breast cancers.
The major finding from this study is that HSP90 inhibitors may
be used as a therapy to treat aromatase inhibitor–resistant breast
cancers. Their ability to target multiple client proteins involved in
the different growth-promoting signaling pathways makes HSP90
inhibitors a valuable and promising novel treatment option for aromatase inhibitor–resistant breast cancer patients. This study provides a clinical basis for future clinical trials using HSP90 inhibitors
in aromatase inhibitor–resistant breast cancers. In addition, treatment regimens using both a HSP90 inhibitor and a signal transduction inhibitor may also be considered for improved efficacy.
