Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma is an aggressive pediatric cancer exhibiting skeletal muscle
differentiation. New therapeutic targets are required to improve the dismal prognosis for invasive
or metastatic alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. Protein kinase C iota (PKCι) has been shown to play
an important role in tumorigenesis of many cancers but little is known about its role in
rhabdomyosarcoma. Our gene expression studies in human tumor samples revealed
overexpression of PRKCI. We confirmed overexpression of PKCι at the mRNA and protein level
using our conditional mouse model that authentically recapitulates the progression of
rhabdomyosarcoma in humans. Inhibition of Prkci by RNA interference resulted in a dramatic
decrease in anchorage-independent colony formation. Interestingly, treatment of primary cell
cultures using aurothiomalate (ATM), which is a gold-containing classical anti-rheumatic agent
and a PKCι-specific inhibitor, resulted in decreased interaction between PKCι and Par6,
decreased Rac1 activity and reduced cell viability at clinically relevant concentrations. Moreover,
co-treatment with ATM and vincristine, a microtubule inhibitor currently used in
rhabdomyosarcoma treatment regimens, resulted in a combination index (C. I.) of 0.470–0.793
through cooperative accumulation of non-proliferative multinuclear cells in the G2/M phase,
indicating that these two drugs synergize. For in vivo tumor growth inhibition studies, ATM

demonstrated a trend towards enhanced vincristine sensitivity. Overall, these results suggest that
PKCι is functionally important in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma anchorage-independent growth and
tumor cell proliferation and that combination therapy with ATM and microtubule inhibitors holds
promise for the treatment of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a group of aggressive muscle cancers and the most common
soft tissue sarcomas in children and adolescents (1). RMS can arise from skeletal muscle and
non-muscle tissues in the body and the prognosis is dependent on the site of origin and
histological subtype (2). Alveolar (ARMS) and embryonal (ERMS) are the two major
subtypes of RMS in children and adolescents and have distinct genetic abnormalities and
biological behavior (3). ARMS accounts for 25% of all RMS and are accompanied by a high
frequency of invasion and metastasis at the time of initial diagnosis. Despite a
multidisciplinary approach, including surgical resection, irradiation, and intensive
chemotherapy, many children with invasive or metastatic ARMS die of their disease (4).
Target discovery is ongoing to develop molecularly targeted therapies with the goal of
improving prognosis (5).

Author Manuscript

Protein Kinase C (PKC) is a family of serine/threonine kinases made up of at least 12
isozymes (6). PKC isozymes play crucial roles in diverse cellular signaling processes
including cellular proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and angiogenesis (7). PKC
isozymes are classified into three major categories as classic (α, βI, βII, and γ), novel (δ, ε,
η, and θ) and atypical (ξ and ι/λ). Biochemical and immunologic studies indicate that
multiple PKC isozymes are expressed in virtually all cell and tissue types (8). The
expression of individual PKC isozymes is developmentally regulated and is responsive to
the differentiation state of cells and tissues. The role of PKC isozymes in tumor biology is
dependent on the cell type and intracellular localization and hence the different isozymes
may have opposing effects in the same cell (9). PKC isozymes have not only been
implicated in the pathogenesis of many cancers including breast, colon, lung, prostate,
pancreatic, liver and hematopoietic system (8, 9) but also in the development of multidrug
resistance (9–12).

Author Manuscript

Although PKC isozyme expression varies in different cancers, only PKC iota (PKCι) has
been shown to be a human oncogene (13, 14). PKCι plays a pivotal role in the tumorigenesis
of lung, pancreatic, prostate, colon, and ovarian cancers (15–24). Recent findings suggested
that this transformation can be prevented both in vitro and in vivo using a gold-containing
classical anti-rheumatic agent, aurothiomalate (ATM). ATM disrupts the interaction
between the PB1 domain of PKCι and Par6 (13, 18, 24, 25), a protein involved in the
polarity complex formation (26), and inhibits Rac1 activity which is a critical downstream
effector of oncogenic PKCι (27).

Phosphorylation profiles in human ARMS and ERMS indicate that phosphorylation levels of
PKCα, δ, θ, and ξ are upregulated and hence could play roles in the development or
progression of RMS (28). Although few reports are available on the expression profile of the
PKC family in RMS, involvement of individual PKC isozymes and their use as therapeutic
targets are beginning to be explored (8, 29, 30). Herein we report the characterization of
PKC isozymes in RMS, with a focus on the functional role of PKCι in the alveolar subtype
of RMS. Moreover, our data hold forth the possibility that ATM might be an adjuvant
therapy for use in combination with standard rhabdomyosarcoma chemotherapy.

Results
PKCι is over-expressed in human rhabdomyosarcoma

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Expression of PKC isoforms in RMS was determined using real time reverse transcription
(RT)-PCR amongst human skeletal muscle, ARMS and ERMS samples. A full profile is
shown in Supplemental Figure S1. Among the isozymes, only PRKCI and PKCμ were
differentially increased in RMS tumors. Both ARMS and ERMS expressed PRKCI at 2–4
orders of magnitude higher than normal skeletal muscle (p<0.05) (Figure 1a). To determine
if the over-expression of PRKCI was due to genomic amplification, the gene copy number of
PRKCI in human ARMS DNA was compared to that in cases of lung squamous cell
carcinoma harboring PRKCI amplification. No genomic amplification of PRKCI was
observed in the examined cohort of PRKCI over-expressing ARMS (Figure 1b). To confirm
that over-expression of PRKCI mRNA translated into over-expression of PKCι at the
protein level, immunohistochemistry was performed on human ARMS and ERMS
specimens (n = 40 and n = 5, respectively). Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma tumors in
particular demonstrated PKCι expression in greater than 50% of cells for 77.5% of cases,
whereas normal skeletal muscle rarely expressed strong PKCι (Figure 1c). Thus, PKCι
mRNA and protein is overexpressed in human ARMS and ERMS. PKCι was expressed in
tumor cells but not in non-neoplastic cells in the tumor microenvironment.
PKCι is over-expressed in a rhabdomyosarcoma mouse model

Author Manuscript

To validate that our mouse models of ARMS and ERMS reflect the characteristics of human
RMS tumors, expression of Prkci in murine ARMS or ERMS was compared to normal
mouse skeletal muscle using real time RT-PCR (Figure 2a). As seen in human RMS, mouse
ARMS and ERMS over-expressed Prkci to a level 7- to 35-fold higher than normal mouse
skeletal muscle. Immunohistochemistry on paired mouse skeletal muscle and RMS tumor
samples indicated consistently strong Prkci expression levels in tumors as compared to
skeletal muscle (representative results are shown in Figure 2c). We next focused on ARMS,
given the particularly poor prognostic outcomes seen in the clinic (4). To demonstrate that
PKCι was not only expressed but was also activated in ARMS, immunoblotting was
performed to determine expression and phosphorylation of PKCι on paired skeletal muscle
and tumor samples. PKCι was over-expressed and highly activated in the primary tumors
relative to normal skeletal muscle (Figure 2b). Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma primary cell
cultures (U20325, U21459 and U23674) established from biopsies taken at necropsy from
mice were used to analyze the PKCι signaling axis in ARMS, in vitro. Mouse primary cell
cultures exhibited high expression of Prkci at the mRNA level in comparison to a normal

mouse myoblast cell line C2C12 (Figure 2d). The expression and activation of PKCι at the
protein level was higher in the primary cell cultures when compared to C2C12 as confirmed
by immunoblotting (Figure 2e, Supplementary Figure S2) and reflected the trend observed at
the mRNA level for primary cell cultures (Figure 2a).
Suppression of PKCι inhibits mouse tumor cell colony formation in vitro

Author Manuscript

To confirm the role of PKCι in ARMS cells, a mouse specific Prkci small interfering RNA
(siRNA) was transfected into mouse primary cell cultures. Immunoblotting was used to
confirm depletion of PKCι. Prkci siRNAs at ≥1 nM depleted total PKCι and its
phosphorylated form efficiently (Figure 3a, Supplementary Figure S3). Anchorageindependent colony formation was also markedly inhibited at 10–100 nM of Prkci siRNA
(Figure 3b). In contrast, primary cell cultures transfected with Prkci siRNA did not show a
decrease in growth when treated with 1 to 100 nM Prkci siRNA (Figure 3c). These results
are consistent with previous findings in intestinal epithelial cells, non–small cell lung
carcinoma cells, pancreatic cancer cells and ovarian cancer cells, which also showed
inhibition of anchorage-independent colony formation but not growth (18, 19, 22–24).
ATM inhibits mouse tumor cell proliferation in vitro

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

In an effort to translate these studies to the clinic, ATM, a highly selective inhibitor of
PKCι, was used to inhibit PKCι function in mouse ARMS primary cell cultures. ATM was
identified through a high-throughput drug screen for its ability to inhibit PKCι binding to its
effector, Par6, in vitro (24). PKCι mediated transformation requires activation of the more
downstream effector molecule, Rac1. PKCι regulates Rac1 through interaction with Par6
(18). Our previous studies demonstrated that ATM is particularly effective as an anti-tumor
agent in tumor cells that express elevated levels of its target PKCι (17). Given our current
observation that ARMS tumors express high levels of PKCι, we hypothesized that ATM
would have anti-tumor activity against ARMS. In our experiments, immunoprecipitation of
PKCι and Par6 revealed that the PKCι-Par6 interaction in ARMS cell was decreased by
ATM at clinically achievable concentrations in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4a,
Supplementary Figure S4). To determine if PKCι was important for invasion of tumor cells,
we performed an invasion assays with primary cell cultures treated with increasing
concentrations of ATM (10 to 500 μM) (Figure 4b). No statistical difference was found in
the number of cells invading through the extracellular matrix chamber between untreated
and treated cells expect at the high concentration of ATM (500 μM). Next, primary cell
cultures were treated with increasing concentrations of ATM (10 to 1000 μM) (Figure 4a).
Interestingly, the growth of primary cell cultures was inhibited to a greater degree than for
C2C12, which is a mouse myoblast cell line. For ARMS primary cell cultures the IC50
ranged from 54 to 166 μM.
Treatment with VCR and ATM has synergic effect through G2 phase mediated nonproliferative multinuclear cell accumulation
We next investigated co-treatment with ATM and vincristine (VCR) because of the recently
demonstrated role of Rac1 in mitosis (31–33). In a cell growth assay, ATM increased VCR
sensitivity of mouse ARMS cells cooperatively, with combination index (C.I.) values lower

than 1.0 at clinically relevant concentrations of 25 μM ATM (34) and 5 nM VCR (35)
(Figure 5a–f). Human ARMS cell line Rh30 which also expressed PKCι phospho-PKCι and
Par6, showed same tendency of ATM and VCR combination as compared with C2C12
(Supplementary Figure S5). Cell cycle analysis of the primary cell cultures treated with
ATM and VCR revealed an increasing percentage of cells in the G2 phase or in cells having
≥4N DNA content with the combination of ATM and VCR as compared to ATM only or
VCR only (p<0.05) (Figure 6a). Rac1 activation assay revealed that ATM treatment
decreased Rac1 activity (p<0.05), whereas VCR treatment had no effect on Rac1 activity
(Figure 6b). To confirm these findings, we performed immunocytochemistry for β-tubulin
and DAPI with ATM and/or VCR treated cells. The number of multinuclear cells (MNC)
was increased by VCR, and a statistically significant difference was found in the number of
MNC between VCR alone and VCR plus ATM (P<0.05) (Figure 6c). Moreover, Ki67
immunofluorescence showed that the population of non-proliferative MNC was increased by
ATM and VCR (71.2% vs 58.8% Ki67 positive MNC with VCR + ATM vs VCR alone)
(p<0.05) (Figure 6c, Supplementary Figure S6). These MNC did not have activated
apoptosis as measured by Cleaved Caspase-3 stain, TUNEL assay or Annexin-V/PI stains
assay, cellular senescence as measured by senescence associated β-galactosidase stain, or
muscle differentiation as detected by myosin heavy chain expression (Supplementary Figure
S7).
ATM enhanced VCR sensitivity in vivo

Author Manuscript

Next we assessed the effect of combination with ATM and VCR in vivo. We previously
showed that the serum gold level associated with a dose of ATM 60 mg/kg i.m. injection
daily for mouse was consistent with the serum gold level typically observed in rheumatoid
arthritis patients undergoing ATM therapy (17). VCR dose was chosen at 1 mg/kg based on
previous report (36, 37). Tumor growth exhibited a consistent trend decrease in the ATM
treated group comparing control group. While VCR was able to decrease tumor growth
significantly, ATM led to a consistent trend to improve VCR sensitivity in vivo although this
trend did not reach significance (Figure 7a, Table S2a). With regard to differential toxicity,
no significant differences in mice body weight between control vs ATM treated group, and
VCR vs VCR and ATM treated group were observed (Figure 7b, Table S2b).

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Rhabdomyosarcomas are the most common tissue sarcomas in children. Despite efforts to
improve treatment regimens, the survival rate for RMS, especially ARMS, has remained
unchanged for the past two decades; the 4-year survival rate for patients with metastatic
ARMS expressing PAX3-FKHR was reported to be 20% or less (2, 3, 38). These poor
clinical outcomes have fueled the need for a better understanding of the tumorigenic
mechanisms so that new therapeutic targets/opportunities can be identified (5). Recently,
PKCι had been identified as an oncogene in non-small cell lung cancer (14). Overexpression of PKCι has been linked to progression and metastases of many cancers such as
lung, prostate, pancreatic, colon, esophageal, liver, breast, ovarian and brain tumor (8, 27).
In this report, we conducted the first known study to determine the role of PKCι in ARMS
tumorigenesis and explore its potential as a therapeutic target in this disease. To establish the

relevance of PKCι in RMS tumorigenesis, we first confirmed that PKCι is over-expressed in
human RMS versus normal skeletal muscle. While over-expression of PRKCI mRNA is
attributable to tumor specific gene amplification of PRKCI in squamous cell carcinomas of
lung (14), we found no genomic amplification of PRKCI in the RMS samples we tested,
though examination of a larger cohort of human tumors may be warranted. We have also
shown that PKCι protein over-expression parallels its mRNA over-expression in human
tumors. We validated that our conditional mouse ARMS model had the same characteristics
as human ARMS in terms of PKCι over-expression at the mRNA and protein level and thus
could be used to study the role of PKCι in ARMS tumorigenesis.

Author Manuscript

While our work is the first to examine the role of PKCι in ARMS, a role for other PKC
isoforms in RMS is also emerging. Many of these studies result from the ability of the broad
spectrum PKC activating compound 12-Otetradecanoyl-Phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) to induce
differentiation in ERMS and ARMS cell lines (39–41). More specific reports have
demonstrated that PKCα, PKCδ, PKCθ, and PKCζ may be phosphorylated in approximately
two-thirds of ARMS and half of ERMS (28). One therapeutically-based study has gone so
far as to suggest that PKC isoforms may be required for phosphorylation and activation of
the Pax3:Fkhr chimeric transcription factor in ARMS (29). Another study indicated that
PKCμ and PKCε (and perhaps PKCθ) are mediators of Igf-1 protection against rapamycininduced apoptosis in a Pax3:Fkhr expressing ARMS (42). Meanwhile, other studies are
focused on the roles of PKC isoforms upstream or downstream of cell surface interacting
proteins. For example, in an ERMS cell line, PKCε was suggested to play a role in cell
surface localization of microenvironment interacting metalloproteases (43), whereas PKCζ
was thought to play a role downstream in the response to IL-1beta (44).

Recently we and others have shown that PKCι drives anchorage-independent growth of
lung, colon and ovarian cancers (14, 18, 22, 23). Using RNA interference, we have now
established that PKCι also plays a role in ARMS transformation as measured by anchorageindependent growth. Genetic inhibition of Prkci reduced the relative number of colonies
formed by ARMS primary cell cultures but had no effect on a normal mouse myoblast cell
line. We evaluated PKCι as a therapeutic target using the selective PKCι inhibitor ATM, a
therapeutic agent we recently discovered and have taken into clinical trials for lung cancer
(Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT 00575393). ATM reduced not only the interaction of PKCι-Par6,
but also proliferation of mouse ARMS cells. ATM trough concentrations observed during
ATM treatment of rheumatoid arthritis patients is 15.4–25.4 μM (34), which is slightly
higher than the IC50 for our mouse ARMS cells. We next investigated the synergic effect of
ATM and VCR, which binds to tubulin and inhibits microtubule formation, therefore,
arresting the cell at metaphase by disrupting formation of the mitotic spindle (45).
Interestingly, ATM enhanced VCR sensitivity of mouse ARMS cells and their C.I is below
1 at clinically achievable concentrations, indicating that ATM synergizes with VCR. For
example, C.I.’s of 25 μM ATM and 5 nM VCR for U23674, U21459 and U20325 were
0.793, 0.572 and 0.470, respectively. Moreover, we obtained comparable results from in
vivo experiments. Cell cycle analysis indicated that the combination of ATM and VCR
induced significantly more G2 and ≥4N cells compared to VCR alone. Immunofluorescence
indicated that the combination of ATM and VCR induced significantly more Ki67-negative

MNC compared to VCR alone. It has been previously shown that MNC arising after VCR
are incapable of proliferation and do not contribute to tumor re-growth (46). Moreover, Rac1
is a major downstream effector of PKCι-Par6 signaling axis that is inhibited by ATM (27)
and known as a regulator of mitosis (31–33). In our study, Rac1 activity was reduced by
ATM but not by VCR. Based on these results, we hypothesize that treatment with VCR and
ATM synergize through G2 phase mediated non-proliferative and multinuclear cell
accumulation (Figure 6d). We conclude that combination therapy with VCR and ATM
should be investigated further for the clinical treatment ARMS and that especially for
children with vincristine-associated peripheral neuropathy, adding ATM might be an
approach to improve efficacy despite vincristine dose reduction. Furthermore, the greatest
therapeutic value of a well-tolerated agent such as ATM may be in combination with other
targeted therapeutics, which is an avenue of ongoing investigation.
