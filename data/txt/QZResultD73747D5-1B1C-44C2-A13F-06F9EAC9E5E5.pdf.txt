ABSTRACT
LIN28 has emerged as an oncogenic driver in a number of cancers, including
neuroblastoma (NB). Overexpression of LIN28 correlates with poor outcome in NB,
therefore drugs that impact the LIN28/Let-7 pathway could be beneficial in treating
NB patients. The LIN28/Let-7 pathway affects many cellular processes including the
regulation of cancer stem cells and glycolytic metabolism. Polyamines, regulated
by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) modulate eIF-5A which is a direct regulator of
the LIN28/Let-7 axis. We propose that therapy inhibiting ODC will restore balance
to the LIN28/Let-7 axis, suppress glycolytic metabolism, and decrease MYCN
protein expression in NB. Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) is an inhibitor of ODC in
clinical trials for children with NB. In vitro experiments using NB cell lines, BE(2)-C,
SMS-KCNR, and CHLA90 show that DFMO treatment reduced LIN28B and MYCN
protein levels and increased Let-7 miRNA and decreased neurosphere formation.
Glycolytic metabolic activity decreased with DFMO treatment in vivo. Additionally,
sensitivity to DFMO treatment correlated with LIN28B overexpression (BE(2)-C>SMSKCNR>CHLA90). This is the first study to demonstrate that DFMO treatment restores
balance to the LIN28/Let-7 axis and inhibits glycolytic metabolism and neurosphere
formation in NB and that PET scans may be a meaningful imaging tool to evaluate the
therapeutic effects of DFMO treatment.

INTRODUCTION

remission but many who go into remission will relapse, at
which point long term survival is less than 10% [1].
Studies have shown that polyamines play an
important role in many cancers including NB [4-6].
The rate limiting enzyme of polyamine biosynthesis is
Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). The ODC gene is found
upstream of MYCN [7] and since MYCN amplification
is seen in 30% of neuroblastoma, ODC overexpression
is common in NB patients and correlates with poor
outcomes [1]. ODC’s specific function is to convert
the polyamine precursor ornithine into the polyamine
putrescine. Putrescine is then converted to the polyamines
spermidine and spermine in the polyamine metabolism
pathway. Little is known about the specific functions

Neuroblastoma (NB) is a pediatric cancer that is
generally diagnosed in children before the age of five [1].
NB arises from cells of the sympathetic nervous tissue
and primary tumors are typically found in the adrenal
gland, but can also be found along sympathetic nerves in
the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis [1]. NB tumors are
highly invasive and often metastasize to secondary sites
including bone, lymph nodes, liver, and bone marrow
[1]. High risk NB patients are characterized by MYCN
amplification, age greater than 18 months, unfavorable
histology, and aggressive metastatic disease [2, 3].

of polyamines; however, preclinical and early studies
targeting polyamines in cancer have yielded promising
results [4, 8, 9].
One specific function of spermidine has been
identified. Spermidine is a substrate needed for posttranscriptional modification of the translation initiation
factor eIF-5A, a process called hypusination [10-12].
Recent studies show that eIF-5A is a direct regulator of
the LIN28/Let-7 pathway [13, 14], which is important
in a number of cancers, including NB, and was recently
identified as a pathway of particular importance in tumor
initiating cells [15]. LIN28 is a miRNA binding protein
that is highly expressed in undifferentiated cells and has
reported oncogenic properties [16]. Let-7 is a miRNA
that acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting oncogene
transcription [17-19]. LIN28 and Let-7 are highly
regulated throughout development and interact via a
double negative feedback loop in which LIN28 inhibits
Let-7 and vice versa [16]. Recent studies have shown that
high LIN28B expression is associated with worse survival
outcomes in NB patients and that deletion of LIN28B
significantly reduces NB cell growth [20]. Additionally,
the LIN28 and Let-7 are both linked to MYCN protein
expression, therefore the LIN28/Let-7 pathway may be
particularly important in high risk, MYCN-amplified NB
patients [21].
A recent study showed that the LIN28/Let-7 axis
directly regulates glycolytic metabolism [22], a process
that is important in both cancer cells and stem cells. In this
study, LIN28 enhanced glucose uptake via an increase in
insulin-PI3K-mTOR signaling, which regulates glycolytic
metabolism. Let-7 was shown to suppress this pathway,
thereby reducing glucose uptake and downregulating
glycolytic metabolism [22]. Elevated glycolytic
metabolism is a characteristic common in many cancers,
including NB [23, 24]. Thus, targeting the LIN28/Let-7
axis may be a beneficial method for decreasing tumor
metabolic activity in these cancers (Figure 1).
Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) is a drug that
inhibits polyamine biosynthesis, thus impacting the
LIN28/Let-7 axis. DFMO was originally developed over
30 years ago as chemotherapeutic agent and has since been
widely used as a treatment for parasitic diseases. Although
early clinical studies with DFMO were disappointing,
more recent trials using DFMO in combination with other
chemotherapies or as a single chemopreventative agent
have shown promising results [9, 25-29]. DFMO works
by irreversibly binding to and inhibiting ODC. When ODC
is inactive, ornithine cannot be converted to putrescine,
which hinders the downstream production of spermidine
and spermine and prevents the hypusination of eIF-5A
[12]. Studies have shown that DFMO treatment effectively
reduces polyamine levels of NB cells in vitro [4], and
clinical trials are currently underway using DFMO to treat
cancer, including NB.
Recent anecdotal clinical cases have shown that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

DFMO treatment reduces glycolytic metabolic activity
of tumors in patients (Figure 1). In three separate cases,
NB patients enrolled in a Phase I DFMO clinical trial
had reduced tumor metabolic activity as measured by
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans after starting
DFMO treatment and exhibited prolonged stabilization
of disease [9]. In light of these clinical observations
and recent studies linking polyamines to the LIN28/Let7 axis [13] and LIN28/Let-7 to glycolytic metabolism
[22], we hypothesize that treatment with DFMO will
restore balance to the LIN28/Let-7 axis, thereby reducing
glycolytic metabolism in NB. We also believe that, due to
the direct interaction between LIN28 and MYCN [21], NB
cell lines that have high LIN28B and MYCN expression
will be more sensitive to DFMO treatment.

Figure 1: A) Patient PET scans. Patient treated on Phase

I study of DFMO tablets with 1000mg/m2 twice daily shows
reduced tumor metabolic activity after one cycle of DFMO
treatment, indicated by decreased 18F-FDG uptake in tumors.
After starting DFMO treatment, the patient’s tumor was still
present, although showed negative PET avidity. Decreased PET
activity is an indication of reduced glycolytic metabolism. B)
Proposed pathway of DFMO effects on LIN28/Let-7 axis and
glycolytic metabolism in NB. DFMO reversibly inhibits ODC,
leading to reduced hypusination of eIF5A and a reversal of the
LIN28/Let-7 axis. Changes in LIN28/Let-7 axis likely contribute
to reduced glycolytic metabolic activity seen in NB cells treated
with DFMO.

confirm that sensitivity to DFMO correlates with higher
LIN28B and MYCN gene expression in all three cell lines
(BE(2)C>SMS KCNR>CHLA90). Sensitivity to DFMO
varied between cell lines in other in vitro experiments as
well. Compared to BE(2)-C and SMS-KCNR cell lines,
CHLA90 cells required a longer treatment time to show
decreases in LIN28B and MYCN protein expression
when treated with DFMO (Figure 3A). Additionally, the
CHLA90 cell line did not exhibit any increase in Let-7
miRNA expression after DFMO treatment for 6 hours
(Figure 3B) or a decrease in ATP/cell levels after DFMO
treatment for 72 or 96 hours (Figure 5). Significant
increase in Let-7 expression and decrease in ATP/cell were
seen in both BE(2)-C and SMS-KCNR cell lines.

LIN28B and MYCN genes are variably expressed
in NB cell lines
Microarray analysis was used to assess relative
levels of LIN28B and MYCN RNA expression in three
NB cell lines: BE(2)-C, SMS-KCNR, and CHLA90.
Expression levels were compared to a normal human
tissue control reference set and all p-values are adjusted
p-values, with a threshold of less than 0.05. Fold change in
expression for each cell line is shown in Table 1. LIN28B
and MYCN gene expression varied in the three NB cell
lines. BE(2)-C cells highly expressed both LIN28B (83fold increase, p = 1.1E-14) and MYCN (399-fold increase,
p = 4.3E-19) relative to SMS-KCNR and CHLA90 cells,
SMS-KCNR cells exhibited moderate expression of
LIN28B (14-fold increase, p = 4.4E-8) relative to BE(2)-C
cells and high expression of MYCN (426-fold increase,
p = 3.9E-19), and CHLA90 cells had low expression of
both LIN28B (6.4-fold increase, p = 5.1E-5) and MYCN
(5.1 fold increase, p = 3.4E-4) relative to the BE(2)-C and
SMS-KCNR cell lines.

from 0.156 mM to 80 mM (Figure 2). The BE(2)-C cell
line was the most sensitive to DFMO treatment with an
IC50 of 3.0 mM, followed by the SMS-KCNR cell line
which had an IC50 of 10.6 mM. The CHLA90 cell line was

DFMO inhibits neurosphere formation
The neurosphere assay is one of the most frequently
used methods to isolate, expand and also calculate the
frequency of neural stem cells. Neurosphere assays were
performed using BE(2)-C cells which showed a dose
dependent decrease in neurosphere formation with DFMO
treatment. At 5 mM DFMO all neurosphere formation
was inhibited in triplicate assays (p < 0.01) for both
SMS-KCNR and BE(2)-C cell lines. With the addition
of increasing DFMO concentrations, there was a 9-fold
decrease in percentage of neurospheres formed between
0.125 and 2.5 mM (Figure 4).

qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated changes in Let7 miRNA expression in response to DFMO treatment
(Figure 3B). BE(2)-C, SMS-KCNR, and CHLA90 cell
lines were treated for 6 hours with 5 mM or 10 mM
DFMO. Significant increases in Let-7 miRNA expression
were evident for both BE(2)-C and SMS-KCNR cell lines
with both 5 mM and 10 mM DFMO treatments when
compared to untreated cells. BE(2)-C cells exhibited a
1.4 fold increase in Let-7 miRNA expression with 5 mM
DFMO treatment (p < 0.05 and a 3.6-fold increase with
10 mM treatment (p < 0.001). SMS-KCNR cells showed
a 2.4 fold increase in Let-7 miRNA expression with 5

were performed in BE(2)-C, SMS-KCNR, and CHLA90
cells after 72 or 96 hours of treatment with 10 mM DFMO
(Figure 5). Total ATP was decreased in all cell lines at
both timepoints when compared to untreated (Figure
5A). Cell number was also decreased in all samples when
compared to untreated (Figure 5B); however, there were
no significant differences in cell number between cell
lines. The ratio of ATP/cell was significantly lower in the
BE(2)-C cell line after treatment with DFMO for both 72
hours (p < 0.001) and 96 hours (p < 0.001). ATP/cell also
decreased significantly in SMS-KCNR cells for both 72
hour (p < 0.05) and 96 hour (p < 0.001) timepoints. ATP/
cell was significantly lower at 96 hours compared to 72
hours for both BE(2)-C (p < 0.01) and SMS-KCNR (p <
0.05) cell lines, indicating that longer exposure to DFMO
treatment is more effective. CHLA90 cells exhibited no
significant changes in ATP/cell after 72 or 96 hours of
treatment with DFMO. These results indicate that DFMO
treatment has significant effects on glycolytic metabolism
in NB cells, especially in cell lines with high LIN28B and
MYCN gene expression.

In vivo studies demonstrated that DFMO treatment
reduced glycolytic metabolic activity as measured by
a decrease in PET activity in tumors measured using
SUVmax in DFMO-treated mice (Figure 6). SUVmax was
considerably lower in DFMO-treated mice after 19 days
of treatment compared to untreated mice, though results
were not significant (p < 0.08). SUVmax was significantly
lower for DFMO-treated mice after 32 days of treatment
compared to untreated mice (p < 0.05). Tumor volume was
approximately 1.0 cm3 lower in the DFMO-treated group
after 32 days when compared to untreated. No DFMO
treated mice exhibited any signs of DFMO toxicity (n = 4
mice per group).

DISCUSSION
Our study is the first to demonstrate that DFMO
treatment restores balance to the LIN28/Let-7 axis
and inhibits glycolytic metabolism in NB. This is
demonstrated by the decrease in LIN28B protein levels

(Figure 3A) and increase in Let-7 miRNA expression
(Figure 3B) seen with DFMO treatment. This change in
the LIN28/Let-7 axis also appears to affect MYCN protein
expression since MYCN is seen to decrease in the two cell
lines tested which overexpress MYCN (Figure 3A). An
interesting finding was that higher LIN28B and MYCN
gene expression levels correlate with greater sensitivity
to DFMO in NB cell lines. BE(2)-C cells, which have
high LIN28B and MYCN expression (Table 1), were
the most sensitive to DFMO treatment in all in vitro
experiments (Figures 2-5). Conversely, CHLA90 cells
had low expression for both LIN28B and MYCN (Table
1) and were consistently the most resistant to DFMO
treatment (Figures 2, 3, 5). The lack of change in MYCN
protein expression seen in the CHLA90 cell line was
expected since CHLA90 cells have baseline low MYCN
gene expression. SMS-KCNR cells had high MYCN and
moderate LIN28B expression relative to BE(2)-C and
CHLA90 cells (Table 1) and had consistent moderate
sensitivity to DFMO treatment (Figures 2-5). These data
are consistent with other studies showing that DFMO
treatment affected LIN28/Let-7 in colorectal cancer [13]
and that changes in MYCN protein expression were seen
with changes in the LIN28/Let-7 axis in other studies of
NB at these doses [21]. These changes occur at doses
correlating to established IC50’s within range of those
previously reported in NB [4, 8]. These results reinforce
claims that polyamines play an important role in the
LIN28/Let-7 pathway [13], since those cell lines with the
greatest LIN28B and MYCN gene expression were most
sensitive to a treatment that depletes polyamine levels. The
findings also indicate that DFMO treatment may be more
effective for NB patients with overexpression of genes
that play a role in the LIN28/Let-7 axis. As such, genomic
analysis of patient tumors may be beneficial in predicting
response to DFMO therapy.
Changes in bioenergetics of NB cell lines treated
with DFMO, as measured by ATP/cell, suggest that
DFMO treatment may result in a reduction of glycolytic
metabolism in NB (Figure 5). Many cancer cells are
reprogramed to produce ATP primarily via glycolytic
metabolism as opposed to oxidative phosphorylation, a
phenomenon termed the “Warburg effect” [24, 30-35].
Because this phenomenon is well documented in NB [36],
we used ATP/cell as a measure of glycolytic metabolic
activity in NB. BE(2)-C and SMS-KCNR cell lines had
decreased ATP/cell levels when treated with DFMO. These
data indicate that DFMO treatment reduces metabolic
activity in these cell lines. This reduction in glycolytic
metabolism can be attributed to the restoration of balance
in the LIN28/Let-7 axis caused by DFMO treatment. A
recent study showed that changes in the LIN28/Let-7
signaling pathway led to changes in glycolytic metabolism
in NB [22]. In this study, higher levels of LIN28 protein
correlated with greater phosphorylation of AKT and
S6, both of which play important roles in the insulinwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

PI3K-mTOR signaling pathway that regulates glycolytic
metabolism. This indicates that the LIN28/Let-7 axis
plays a significant role in regulating glycolytic metabolic
activity in NB.
To further validate that DFMO treatment reduces
glycolytic metabolism in NB, we tested the effects of
DFMO treatment on 18F-FDG uptake of NB tumors
through an in vivo microPET study (Figure 6). It has been
proven that PET scans provide a quantifiable measure of
glycolytic metabolism in living tumors by measuring the
breakdown of 18F-FDG (18F radiolabeled glucose analogue)
[37]. It has been previously established that administration
of 2% DFMO in drinking water resulted in optimal
reduction in both tumor cell polyamine levels and tumor
size in melanoma models [38-41]. In our model, there
was a significant reduction in 18F-FDG uptake in these
tumors as well. These data, along with the PET scans from
patients enrolled in the phase I DFMO clinical trial [9],
indicate that DFMO treatment has a substantial impact on
glycolytic metabolism in tumors. This study also suggests
that because tumor activity changed with little change to
tumor volume, 18F-FDG PET imaging may be a tool to
consider in the evaluation of the therapeutic response to
DFMO treatment in both pre-clinical and clinical settings.
Interestingly, recent studies have shown that LIN28
is an important oncogenic driver in cancer stem cells
[15, 42] which may evade standard chemotherapeutic
approaches and cause relapse in patients. Additionally,
studies have shown that cancer stem cells depend
on glycolytic metabolism for ATP production [43].
Neurosphere formation requires the presence of cancer
stem cells within wells. In the presence of DFMO,
inhibition of neurosphere formation suggests that DFMO
has affected the stem cells ability to form neurospheres.
Since our findings show that DFMO affects these
important cancer stem cell pathways and inhibits
neurosphere formation in NB, we will further elucidate
the effects of DFMO on NB cancer stem cells in future
studies.
Overall, our work shows that inhibiting polyamine
biosynthesis with DFMO treatment effectively restores
balance to the LIN28/Let-7 axis. These results have
exciting clinical implications. The reduction in glycolytic
metabolism via DFMO treatment holds promise for
reducing tumor metabolic activity in NB. Additionally,
cells with higher LIN28B and MYCN gene expression are
more sensitive to DFMO treatment, so DFMO may prove
an effective therapy for aggressive, MYCN-amplified
NB. Finally, these results provide a new perspective
on the use of 18F-FDG PET imaging in pre-clinical and
clinical DFMO studies. Since tumor activity may change
significantly with little or no change to tumor volume,
18
F-FDG PET may offer more meaningful information in
DFMO studies than other imaging tools, both for planning
treatment and monitoring disease progression.

for 48, 72, or 96 hours. Drug supplemented medium was
refreshed after 48 hours for 72 and 96 hours timepoints.
H2O was used as vehicle control. Cells were lysed
with RIPA lysis buffer (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA),
supplemented with a complete protease inhibitor (Roche,
Madison, WI). Cell lysates were collected and frozen at
-80°C overnight to ensure complete cell lysis. Protein
concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA). Lysates were electrophoresed on a
12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel in running buffer (Bio-Rad).
Thirty µg of protein was loaded per lane. Gels were semidry transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using the
Turbo Transfer system with Turbo Transfer buffer (BioRad). Primary antibodies used were: rabbit polyclonal
LIN28B, rabbit polyclonal MYCN, and rabbit polyclonal
β-actin (Cell Signaling). Goat anti-rabbit secondary
antibody was used (Licor). Protein bands were detected by
fluorescence using the Odyssey infrared imaging system
(Licor).

RNA expression profiling analysis
RNA expression analysis was performed for
untreated BE(2)-C, SMS-KCNR, and CHLA90 cells. 5
x 104 cells were collected into 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes
and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C to
pellet. Pellets were rinsed twice with 500 µL of ice cold
PBS with 1 µL SuperaseIn RNase inhibitor (Ambion,
Austin, TX) before adding 250 µl of ice cold PBS + 2 µL
SuperaseIn (Ambion) and storing at -80°C. All samples
were shipped to Clinical Research Laboratories (CRL)
(Lenexa, KS) where Affymetrix GeneChip U133 Plus 2.0
genome wide expression cDNA microarray was used to
determine RNA expression. All cell lines were tested in
duplicate. All analysis was done using R/Bioconductor
packages and Partek Genomics Suite.

Quantitative RT-PCR
qRT-PCR analysis was used to evaluate Let-7
miRNA expression. Cells were plated at 100,000 cells/
well in 6-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight prior
to drugging with 5 mM or 10 mM DFMO for 6 hours.
Lysates were collected using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) then stored in -80°C for up to 1 month prior to RNA
extraction. RNA was extracted using BCP (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO) and RNA cleanup was performed using the
miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valenca, CA). cDNA was
made using the TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription
Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) along with
RT primers specific for human Let-7i-5p or RNU44
(Applied Biosystems). All sets of reactions were run in
triplicate using 30-100 ng cDNA per reaction, Taqman
Fast Advanced Master Mix and Let-7i-5p and RNU44

Cell viability and IC50 values
Calcein AM fluorescent assay (Molecular Probes,
Eugene, OR) was used to determine cell viability in
96-well plates. SMS-KCNR cells were plated at 5,000

performed using ΔΔCT; each treatment was normalized to
the untreated sample.

Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Tumor cells were injected
subcutaneously into the right flank. Tumors were allowed
to grow to approximately 0.3 cm3 before separating mice
into untreated and DFMO-treated groups with the same
average tumor volume. Both groups underwent baseline
PET/CT scans prior to starting drug treatment. 2% DFMO
was administered in drinking water (4 g DFMO into 200
mL H2O). Water was changed twice weekly. All mice
underwent PET/CT scans when average tumor volume
reached 1.0 cm3 and again at 2.5 cm3. Caliper tumor
measurements were completed bi-weekly until tumors
reached a volume of 1.5 cm3 at which point tumors
were measured 3 times per week. Throughout the study
average weight for mice in both treatment groups was
approximately 20 g. All mice were euthanized when the
first mouse reached a tumor volume of 3.0 cm3.

Neurosphere Assays
Neuroblastoma cell lines BE(2)-C and SMS-KCNR
cells were plated in RPMI media containing 10% FBS,
1% Pen/Strep at a concentration of 2 cells/well in ultranonadherent 96-well plates. (Corning cat#3474) The final
cell concentration was 40 cells/mL, with 50 µl added to
the inner 60 wells of each plate. 24 hours after plating,
a serial dilution of DFMO was added for final drug
concentrations of 5, 2.5, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, and 0 mM.
DFMO-containing media was refreshed weekly. On days 5
and 10 after drug treatment, all wells were scanned under
10X light microscopy and the number of neurosphere per
well documented. Neurospheres were monitored until day
20 of treatment for changes and growth.

PET/CT Scans
All mice were fasted with free access to water for
at least 6 hours prior to 2’-deoxy-2’-18F-fluoro-D-glucose
(18F-FDG) injection. Mice were placed in a 37.5 °C
heated cage 20-30 minutes prior to radiotracer injection
and moved to a 37.5 °C heated induction chamber 10
minutes prior to injection where they were anesthetized
with 2% isoflurane in 1000 cc/min O2. A dose of 25 µCi in
0.1 ml of 18F-FDG was administered by tail vein injection
and the mice were placed in a 37.5 °C heated induction
chamber for 60 minutes of unconscious uptake. PET scans
were acquired using a Genisys4 PET (Sofie Biosciences,
Culver City, CA) system and CT scans were acquired
using a Bioscan NanoSPECT/CT (Washington, D.C.). A
10 minute static acquisition was used for PET imaging
followed immediately by a 6.5 minute CT acquisition both
utilizing the mouse imaging chamber from the Genisys4.
PET reconstruction was performed without attenuation
correction using 3D Maximum Likelihood Expectation
Maximization with 60 iterations and CT reconstruction
used Filtered Back Projection with a Shepp-Logan Filter.
PET and CT reconstructions were exported in dicom
image format, fused and analyzed using custom software
developed by the Small Animal Imaging Facility at
Van Andel Institute. Standardized Uptake Values were
calculated using the mouse body weight and corrected
for residual dose in the injection syringe and the injection
site, as applicable. The formula used to calculate SUV

ATP per cell
The Cell Titer GLO luminescent assay (Promega,
Madison, WI), which measures total ATP levels, was
combined with the CyQuant fluorescent DNA assay
(Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) to measure ATP level
per cell. SMS-KCNR cells were plated at 5,000 cells/
well, CHLA90 cells were plated at 4,000 cells/well and
BE(2)-C cells were plated at 3,000 cells/well in 96-well
black-walled plates. Cells were treated for 72 or 96 hrs
with 5 mM or 10 mM DFMO in RPMI-1640 with 10%
FBS. 1% H2O in RPMI-1640 was used as control. After
72 or 96 hrs, medium was aspirated and replaced with
Cell Titer GLO reagent (lysis buffer mixed with Cell
Titer GLO substrate, diluted with PBS 1:1) supplemented
with CyQuant stock solution (50 µL dye per 10 mL Cell
Titer GLO reagent). Plates were rocked on an orbital
shaker for 3 minutes at 20°C to induce cell lysis, and
then were incubated an additional 10 minutes at 20°C to
allow luminescent signal stabilization. Luminescence and
fluorescence data were recorded using a Wallace plate
reader and Envision software. Cell Titer GLO data were
divided by CyQuant data and normalized to vehicle wells
in order to generate data on ATP per cell.
