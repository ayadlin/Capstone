Abstract
Breast cancer frequently metastasizes to bone, in which tumor cells receive signals from the bone marrow
microenvironment. One relevant factor is TGF-b, which upregulates expression of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling
molecule, Gli2, which in turn increases secretion of important osteolytic factors such as parathyroid hormone–
related protein (PTHrP). PTHrP inhibition can prevent tumor-induced bone destruction, whereas Gli2 overexpression in tumor cells can promote osteolysis. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that Hh inhibition in
bone metastatic breast cancer would decrease PTHrP expression and therefore osteolytic bone destruction.
However, when mice engrafted with human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were treated with the Hh receptor
antagonist cyclopamine, we observed no effect on tumor burden or bone destruction. In vitro analyses revealed
that osteolytic tumor cells lack expression of the Hh receptor, Smoothened, suggesting an Hh-independent
mechanism of Gli2 regulation. Blocking Gli signaling in metastatic breast cancer cells with a Gli2-repressor gene
(Gli2-rep) reduced endogenous and TGF-b–stimulated PTHrP mRNA expression, but did not alter tumor cell
proliferation. Furthermore, mice inoculated with Gli2-Rep–expressing cells exhibited a decrease in osteolysis,
suggesting that Gli2 inhibition may block TGF-b propagation of a vicious osteolytic cycle in this MDA-MB-231
model of bone metastasis. Accordingly, in the absence of TGF-b signaling, Gli2 expression was downregulated in
cells, whereas enforced overexpression of Gli2 restored PTHrP activity. Taken together, our findings suggest that
Gli2 is required for TGF-b to stimulate PTHrP expression and that blocking Hh-independent Gli2 activity will
inhibit tumor-induced bone destruction. Cancer Res; 71(3); 822–31. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Despite advances in the prevention and treatment of breast
cancer, it remains the second leading cause of cancer deaths in
women (1) which is, in part, due to its propensity to metastasize
to distant organs such as lung and bone. Breast cancer patients
who develop bone metastases suffer increased morbidity and
mortality, with increased fracture risk and the possibility of
hypercalcemia among other complications (2, 3). Although

survival rates among breast cancer patients with controlled
local disease remain high, patients with advanced disease
suffer from a 71% decrease in survival (4). Therefore, it is
critical that new approaches be generated for the prevention
and treatment of breast cancer metastasis to bone.
Breast cancer metastasis to bone begins with initiation of
a "vicious cycle" of bone destruction, commencing upon
tumor cell establishment in the bone marrow and resulting
in increased bone resorption, or osteolysis. Tumor cells
receive signals from the bone marrow environment (e.g.,
transforming growth factor-b; TGF-b), which upregulates
expression of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling transcription
factor, Gli2, and leads to increased expression and secretion
of the osteolytic factor parathyroid hormone-related protein
(PTHrP; ref. 4). PTHrP propagates the vicious cycle via PTH
receptor binding on osteoblasts, leading to increased RANKL
expression, which induces osteoclastogenesis. Because the
bone is resorbed, active TGF-b is released from the bone
matrix stimulating further tumor growth and PTHrP expression (5). Inhibition at any point in this process should reduce
bone destruction. For example, neutralizing antibodies
against tumor production of PTHrP inhibits osteolytic bone
destruction and tumor burden in vivo (6, 7). Although

Targeted Inhibition of Gli2 Reduces Cancer Bone Disease

a humanized anti-PTHrP antibody was developed in 2003, no
official report has been made about the success of this
antibody in patients (8, 9). Our laboratory has previously
demonstrated that the Hh signaling transcription factor Gli2
positively regulates PTHrP expression and secretion in
osteolytic breast tumor cells (10).
Canonical Hh signaling occurs through Hh ligand binding
to the membrane receptor Patched (Ptch), which releases
inhibition of a second membrane receptor, Smoothened
(Smo). This release initiates a downstream signaling cascade
resulting in translocation of the Gli family proteins to the
nucleus, where they can initiate transcription (11). Gli protein
activation has been demonstrated in numerous tumor types
and results from a variety of mutations that occur throughout
the Hh signaling pathway (12). In these tumor types, Hh
receptor antagonists, like cyclopamine, have been used successfully to prevent Gli overexpression (13).
Although all Gli family members bind to the same binding
sequence, they have separate and discrete functions in mammalian cells (14). We have shown that Gli2, but not the other
Gli family members, enhances PTHrP expression. Furthermore, expression of Gli2 appears limited to tumor cells that
have high metastatic potential, especially to bone resulting in
osteolytic lesions (10).
Taken together these data suggest that inhibition of Gli2 is a
potential target for the development of therapeutics aimed at
preventing and treating bone metastases. Therefore, we
hypothesized that inhibition of Gli2 in bone metastatic lines
would decrease PTHrP expression and therefore osteolytic
lesions.

Materials and Methods

were conducted according to NIH guidelines. Female, 4week-old athymic nude mice (n ¼ 8, vehicle; n ¼ 13,
cyclopamine; and n ¼ 10, empty vector; n ¼ 7, Gli2-Rep)
were anesthetized by continuous isoflurane and inoculated
with 100,000 MDA-MB-231, MDA-231-cntrl (control), or
MDA-231-Gli2-Rep cells resuspended in PBS via intracardiac
injection into the left cardiac ventricle using a 27-gauge
needle, as previously described (10, 16, 17). Mice were
imaged weekly and sacrificed 4 weeks post-tumor cell
inoculation. For mammary fat pad injections, female 4week-old athymic nude mice (n ¼ 8 per group) were
anesthetized by continuous isoflurane and an incision was
made on the ventral lower abdomen. The left inguinal
mammary gland was inoculated with 1,000,000 MDA-231Gli2-Rep or MDA-231-cntrl cells resuspended in PBS. Tumor
size was assessed by caliper measurements twice per week.
Mice were sacrificed 3 weeks after tumor cell inoculation,
and tumors excised, measured, and weighed.
Radiographic imaging
Mice were radiographically imaged weekly beginning 1week post-tumor cell inoculation using a Faxitron LX-60.
Specifically, mice were anesthetized deeply with ketamine/
xylazine and laid in a prone position on the imaging platform.
Images were acquired at 35 kVp for 8 seconds. Lesion area and
number were measured using quantitative image analysis
software (Metamorph, Molecular Devices, Inc.) by region of
interest analysis. All data are represented as mean lesion area
and number per mouse.
TGF-b/cyclopamine treatments
Cyclopamine (LC Labs) was reconstituted in (2-hydroxypropyl)-b-cyclodextrin solution 45% (w/v) in HOH (SigmaAldrich). Beginning 2 weeks post-tumor cell inoculation, mice
were treated daily with either 10 mg/kg of cyclopamine or
control tomatadine analogue by i.p. injection, as previously
published (13). For in vitro studies, 1 to 10 mmol/L (with data
from 3 mmol/L shown) of cyclopamine or tomatadine was
added to cell culture medium and cells were harvested
24 hours later. Recombinant TGF-b (R&D Systems, Inc.)
was reconstituted in 4 mmol/L of HCl and 1 mg/mL bovine
serum albumin (BSA), and added at 5 ng/mL to serum free cell
culture medium (or as indicated in text).

Cells
The human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 was
obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection)
and a bone metastatic variant generated in our lab was used
for all in vitro and in vivo experiments, as previously published
(6, 10). MDA-MB-231 cells, the human squamous non–small
cell lung carcinoma cell line RWGT2 (15), and human metastatic prostate cancer cell line PC3 (ATCC), were maintained in
DMEM (Cellgro) plus 10%FBS (Hyclone Laboratories) and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin (P/S; Mediatech). The murine chondrocyte cell line TMC23 and human nonosteolytic breast
cancer cell line MCF-7 were cultured in a-MEM (Invitrogen)
plus 10% FBS and 1% P/S. All cell lines are routinely tested for
changes in cell growth and gene expression. MDA-MB-231 cells
were transfected with either Gli2-His, GFP, pcDNA (empty
vector) or Gli2-Rep, by Lipofectamine transfection reagent and
Plus reagent (Invitrogen), per manufacturer's instructions, and
stable cell lines were selected for antibiotic resistance into
single-cell clones by limiting dilutions or pooled colonies under
400 mg/mL G418 selection medium and maintained in culture
medium supplemented with 200 mg/mL G418.

Histology/histomorphometry
Hind-limb specimens (tibiae and femora) were removed
during autopsy and fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin
(Fisher Scientific) for 48 hours at room temperature. Bone
specimens were decalcified in 10% EDTA for 2 weeks at 4 C and
embedded in paraffin. Bone sections (5-mm thickness) were
stained with hematoxylin & eosin (H&E), orange G, and phloxine. Tumor burden in the femora and tibiae was examined
under a microscope and quantified using Metamorph software
(Molecular Devices, Inc.) and region of interest analysis.

System for reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR; Invitrogen)
and random hexamers from 1 to 5 mg of total RNA per
manufacturer's instructions. cDNA (1.0 mL) was used for RTPCR using Platinum PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen). RT-PCR
was conducted for the human homologues of the Hh signaling receptors Ptch and Smo. Primers for amplifying hPtch
are as follows: F, 50 -CGCCTATGCCTGTCTAACCATGC-30 ; R,

56 C for 1 minute, 72 C for 45 seconds) 35 cycles, 72 for
2 minutes.
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
PTHrP, Gli2, and 18s mRNA expression were measured by
Quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR (Q-PCR). After 48-hour incubation, cells were harvested for mRNA, and a cDNA strand was
generated as described above. cDNA was serially diluted to
create a standard curve, and combined with TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), and primer:
TaqMan
PTHLH

TaqMan
Gli2
(Hs00257977_m1), or TaqMan Euk 18S rRNA (43529300910024; Applied Biosystems). Samples were loaded onto an
optically clear 96-well plate (Applied Biosystems) and the QPCR reaction was performed under the following cycling
conditions: 50 C for 2 minutes, 95 C for 10 minutes, (95 C
for 15 seconds, 60 C for 1 minute) x40 cycles on the 7300 RealTime PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Q-PCR reactions were
quantified using the 7300 Real-Time PCR Systems software
(Applied Biosystems).
Cell proliferation assay
In vitro cell proliferation was determined by 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay using the CellTiter 96
Aqueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Promega). Briefly, 2,000 cells per well were plated in 96-well plates
in quadruplicate, and growth was measured at days indicated
spectrophotometrically at 450 nm on a Synergy2 plate reader,
per manufacturer's instructions.
Western blot
Cells were harvested for protein into a 1 radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer (ThermoScientific)
supplemented with a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Roche).
Equal protein concentrations were prepared for loading with
Laemmli sample buffer and electrophoresis was performed on
SDS-PAGE Mini-Protein II ready gels (Bio-Rad). Separated
proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride
(PVDF) in transfer buffer [25 mmol/L of Tris, 192 mmol/L
of glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol (pH 8.3)] at 100 V at 4 C for 1
hour. Membranes were blocked with 1 Tris-buffered saline

All statistical analyses were performed using InStat version
3.03 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Values are presented
as mean  SEM, and P values determined using unpaired t
test, where *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001 unless

Results
Cyclopamine treatment does not prevent tumorinduced bone destruction in vivo
Cyclopamine treatment has previously been reported to
block Hh signaling and inhibit tumor growth in some in vivo
models (18) through its action as a Smo antagonist (19).
Therefore, we first proposed to determine the effects of cyclopamine treatment on osteolytic bone metastases. Mice inoculated with MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells were
treated with 10 mg/kg of cyclopamine or control tomatadine
analogue daily, beginning 2 weeks postinoculation and after
tumor cells had seeded to bone, similar to previously published
treatment regimens which successfully inhibited tumor growth
(20). Surprisingly, cyclopamine inhibited neither tumor growth
nor cancer-induced bone disease in the bone metastasis model.
Indeed, examination by radiography (Fig. 1A) indicated that
there was a slight increase in osteolytic lesion number in mice
treated with cyclopamine when compared with tomatadinetreated mice. After sacrifice, bones were collected from tumorbearing mice from both treatment and control groups for
histology and histomorphometry. Histologically, cyclopamine
treatment had little or no effect on tumor burden in bone
(Fig. 1B) or trabecular bone volume at multiple sites commonly
examined by histology (Fig. 1C). It was concluded that the Hh
receptor antagonist cyclopamine is ineffective treatment for
osteolytic bone metastases in this experimental model of
breast cancer–induced bone destruction.
Canonical Hh signaling does not regulate Gli2 in MDAMB-231 cells
To determine why MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells are not
inhibited by cyclopamine, we next examined the expression of

Hh signaling receptors. MDA-MB-231 cells, which express
both Gli2 and PTHrP and are known to cause osteolysis,
did not express Smo mRNA, and MCF-7 breast cancer cells
(nonosteolytic) and RWGT2, a squamous non–small cell lung
carcinoma cell line, expressed low levels of Smo mRNA
(Fig. 2A). In contrast, PC-3 prostate cancer cells were found
to express Smo mRNA, consistent with findings by another
group that showed these cells are inhibited by cyclopamine
(Fig. 2A; ref. 13).
Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with cyclopamine in vitro
did not alter tumor cell growth over a 7-day treatment period
(Fig. 2B), indicating that Hh signaling does not play a significant role in the growth of these cancer cells. RWGT2 cell
growth was also not inhibited by cyclopamine, despite low
levels of Smo expression (data not shown). We next examined
cyclopamine-treated MDA-MB-231 and RWGT2 cells for
PTHrP and Gli2 expression by Q-PCR. As a positive control,
we also tested the cyclopamine-treated chondrocyte cell line,
TMC-23. Blocking Hh signaling had no effect on PTHrP mRNA
expression in either of the tumor cell lines, and cyclopamine
treatment did not inhibit and in fact increased Gli2 mRNA in
both the MDA-MB-231 and RWGT2 cells (Fig. 2D and E).
Because Hh signaling is known to regulate PTHrP expression
in proliferating chondrocytes (21), we reasoned that TMC-23
cells would be inhibited by cyclopamine, and as expected,

www.aacrjournals.org

Cntrl

PTHrP expression was indeed inhibited by cyclopamine treatment in TMC-23 cells (Fig. 2C). Together, these data confirm
that the compound was active and suggests that osteolytic
tumor cells rely on an alternative mechanism for PTHrP
expression. Thus, Hh signaling inhibition by cyclopamine
appears ineffective toward breast tumor cell growth or expression of osteolytic factors by tumor cells, and we conclude that
elevated Gli2 expression levels in MDA-MB-231 cells is not due
to enhanced Hh signaling through the canonical pathway.
Gli2 inhibition in human bone metastatic breast cancer
cells
Because cyclopamine treatment was ineffective at blocking downstream Gli2 expression in osteolytic tumor cells,
targeted Gli2 inhibition was explored. To specifically inhibit
Gli2 expression, tumor cells were transfected with a Gli2repressor construct (Gli2-Rep) in which the activation
domain of the Gli2 promoter has been replaced with the
engrailed repressor domain as previously described (22). We
have found that this construct efficiently knocks down Gli2
activity in vitro (10). After generating stable cell lines,
positive cells were selected on the basis of neomycin resistance, with both single-cell clones and pools of transfectants
generated. Because of concerns that single cell clones may
result in a selection of a population with a constitutive

decrease in PTHrP or a decrease or increase in aggressiveness, we focused on the pooled populations for these studies.
However, similar results were obtained for all populations
tested. Positive cells were screened for the expression of
Gli2-Rep with an anti-His-tag antibody by Western blot
(Fig. 3A). Interestingly, expression of Gli2-Rep had no effect
on tumor cell growth in vivo when cells were injected
orthotopically into the mammary fat pad of athymic nude
mice (Fig. 3B). Consistent with our previous observation that
Gli2 stimulates PTHrP expression, the expression of Gli2Rep caused a reduction in endogenous PTHrP mRNA expression in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3C).
As others and we have previously shown that TGF-b
stimulates Gli2 and PTHrP expression (10, 23, 24), we hypothesized that blocking Gli2 activity would inhibit the ability of
TGF-b to increase PTHrP expression. We therefore treated
MDA-231-Gli2-Rep cells and MDA-231-cntrl (empty vectortransfected) cells with 5 ng/mL TGF-b in serum-free medium
and measured PTHrP expression by Q-PCR. Inhibition of Gli2
activity completely blocked the TGF-b–induced increase in
PTHrP expression (Fig. 3D). Importantly, the basal level of
PTHrP in MDA-MB-231 cells was not affected by Gli2 inhibition when cells were grown in serum-free medium (Fig. 3D), as
compared with its effect on cells grown in 10% FBS containing
biologically active TGF-b (Fig. 3C). Our data suggest that
direct Gli2 inhibition can attenuate TGF-b induction of

Gli2 inhibition reduces tumor-mediated osteolytic bone
destruction
To determine if blocking Gli2 activity could indeed inhibit
tumor-induced osteolysis, we inoculated pooled MDA-231Gli2-Rep and MDA-231-cntrl cells into athymic female nude
mice via the left cardiac ventricle. After 4 weeks, extensive
osteolytic lesions were visible radiographically in the femora/
tibiae of the control mice. In contrast, the Gli2-Rep mice had
either small or undetectable lesions (Fig. 4A). Quantification of
lesion number and size on radiographs indicated that mice
bearing MDA-231-Gli2-Rep tumor cells had significantly fewer
and smaller lytic lesions than the mice bearing control cells
(Fig. 4B and C). Similar results were obtained for mice
inoculated with Gli2-Rep cells derived from single cell clones
(Supplementary Fig. 1).
In addition to radiographic analyses, tibiae were examined
by ex vivo microcomputed tomography (micro-CT). There was
a significant decrease in trabecular bone volume in the MDA231-cntrl tumor-bearing mice compared with the MDA-231Gli2-Rep tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 5A), although there were no
other significant changes in micro-CT parameters such as
trabecular number, trabecular thickness, or connectivity density (Supplementary Fig. 2). Bone volume of mice inoculated

with MDA-231-Gli2-Rep cells was not significantly different
from non–tumor-bearing, age- and sex-matched mice (BV/TV
¼ 0.0448–0.1518). These data indicate that Gli2 inhibition in
MDA-MB-231 cells decreased the ability of the tumor cells to
induce bone destruction.
Consistent with disrupting TGF-b–induced propagation of
tumor-induced osteolysis, histomorphometric analyses of the
tibiae revealed a significant decrease in tumor burden in Gli2Rep tumor-bearing mice relative to empty vector control
tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 5B), and this was accompanied by
a reduction in detectable PTHrP protein expression identified
by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 5C).

were significantly decreased. These data suggest that Gli2
inhibition impairs the ability of TGF-b to stimulate PTHrP
production, resulting in abrogation of tumor-induced bone
destruction. In addition, overexpression of Gli2 protein in
the MDA-231-DNRII cells resulted in a dramatic increase in
PTHrP promoter activation and a partial rescue of PTHrP
mRNA expression (Fig. 6D), further suggesting that Gli2
expression is downstream of TGF-b signaling. The stimulatory effect of TGF-b on PTHrP expression is thus likely to be
mediated through Gli2.

TGF-b regulation of Gli2 signaling in human osteolytic
breast cancer cells
Because TGF-b is known to regulate PTHrP, and other
groups have shown that TGF-b regulates Gli2 expression in
hepatocarcinoma cells (24), we set out to determine if TGF-b
stimulates Gli2 expression in osteolytic tumor cells. MDA-MB231 cells were tested to determine if TGF-b enhances Gli2
mRNA expression following treatment with 5 ng/mL exogenous TGF-b for 48 hours. Consistent with previous studies in
other cell types, TGF-b significantly enhanced Gli2 and PTHrP
mRNA expression (Fig. 6A) in MDA-MB-231 cells by Q-PCR. As
expected, TGF-b also increased PTHrP protein secretion
(Fig. 6B).
To determine if TGF-b signaling is necessary for Gli2
upregulation in bone metastatic breast cancer cells, we
disrupted this signaling pathway through overexpression
of a dominant negative TGF-b receptor type II (DNRII)
construct in the MDA-MB-231 cells, as previously published
(17). When TGF-b signaling was abolished in this way, both

Our results suggest for the first time that Gli2 inhibition can
prevent the formation of breast cancer bone metastases. Many
tumor types have mutations that lead to a constitutive activation of Gli proteins, demonstrating a clinical need for identifying targets to inhibit this pathway. Current therapeutic
approaches focus primarily on the development of Smo
antagonists, such as cyclopamine analogues. However, our
data suggest that at least in some cancers, cyclopamine
analogues are unlikely to be effective in tumor-induced osteolysis and that direct inhibition of Gli2 activity downstream of
Hh receptors has better therapeutic potential for tumorinduced bone disease.
Our studies indicate that several osteolytic tumor cell lines,
including human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells, either do
not express Smo or express it at very low levels, providing an
explanation for the observed failure of cyclopamine to inhibit
PTHrP expression or tumor-induced bone disease. In light of
these data, the expression levels of Hh receptors, Smo and Ptc,
would have been useful prior to in vivo studies. However, it is
generally assumed that elevated Gli expression is mediated

primarily via upstream Hh receptor activation. Although
recently Smo-independent mechanisms have been described
in prostate cancer (25), this is the first report with regards to
bone metastases of Gli overexpression mediated via a Smoindependent mechanism. Surprisingly, we found that cyclopamine treatment actually increased Gli2 expression, though
these results were not significant in some osteolytic tumor
cells. While the mechanism of this increase remains unclear,
Zhang and colleagues recently reported that cyclopamine has
"off-target" effects on other signaling pathways (26). In addition, other groups have reported that cyclopamine impacts
normal bone marrow cell compartments (27–31). Because

cyclopamine had no significant effect on overall bone disease
in our model, it is unlikely that the compound had any effect
on other cells in the bone tumor microenvironment. However,
because duration of treatment in our experiments was relatively short, we cannot rule out that longer term treatments
may alter cells within the bone marrow. These data suggest
that Smo antagonists are unlikely to be effective and may even
have detrimental effects in some cases of tumor metastasis to
bone. It will be necessary to establish how commonly breast
and other bone-metastasizing cancers are deficient in Smo
expression. These studies are on-going in our laboratory.
Because Smo was not expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells, our
alternative approach was to inhibit Gli2 activity directly using
a Gli2-Rep construct. In this construct, which was previously
used to study muscle development in developing organisms,
the activation domain of Gli2 has been replaced with the
repressor domain of the engrailed protein, resulting in a
repression of Gli target genes (22). Inhibiting Gli2 activity

in this way reduced PTHrP expression and inhibited tumorinduced bone destruction, which is reflected in the reduction
in average osteolytic lesion area as well as number of osteolytic lesions in experiments utilizing populations of MDA-MB231 cells overexpressing Gli2-Rep derived from single cells
(Supplementary Fig. 1). To eliminate the possibility that these
changes may have been due to constitutive variation in PTHrP
expression in individual MDA-MB-231 cells and not due to the
inhibition of Gli2 activity, we demonstrated similar results in
pooled populations of cells expressing the Gli2-Rep construct
(Figs. 4 and 5).
The inhibition of bone destruction and tumor growth
observed in the Gli2-Rep tumor-bearing mice identifies Gli2
as a promising target for developing therapeutic approaches
in the prevention and treatment of tumor-induced bone
disease. Postnatal expression of Gli2 is primarily limited to
the growth plate (32) and the hair follicle (33, 34), making Gli2
an ideal clinical target with low potential for significant

off-target effects in adult patients. Although there are several
reports of potential compounds that inhibit Gli activity (11, 19,
25, 35, 36) only those that inhibit downstream of Smo will be
beneficial in cells deficient in Smo such as those used in this
work. One promising group of small molecules is the Gliantagonist (GANT) compounds, which inhibit Gli function
irrespective of the mutation leading to the activation of Gli
(25). However, perhaps due to limited availability as a result of
lack of large-scale synthesis of these compounds, they have
been tested in relatively few models (25, 37). Importantly,
given the frequency of Smo-independent Hh activation in
prostate cancer, Smo antagonists are unlikely to be effective
in nearly 50% of prostate tumors. The frequency of Hh
activation in clinical samples of primary breast cancer (38)
and in bone metastases from any primary tumor type is
currently unclear, but preclinical studies suggest an important
role for Hh in tumor bone disease (10, 39). Although ultimately, we and others will need to examine the frequency of
Hh mutations in tumors that metastasize to bone in clinical
samples.
We observed a decrease in tumor burden at sites of bone
metastases in the Gli2-Rep intracardiac model, although
tumor growth was unaltered in the Gli2-Rep orthotopic
mammary fat pad model. Because canonical Hh signaling
did not appear to be regulating Gli2 expression, and recent
reports suggested that TGF-b could regulate Gli2 signaling, we
reasoned that the observed decrease in tumor growth was
caused by indirect blockade of TGF-b stimulation of PTHrP. In
this study, we demonstrated that Gli2 is in fact required for
TGF-b to increase PTHrP expression. Importantly, this suggests that when Gli2 is not activated, TGF-b in the bone matrix
will no longer have a stimulatory effect on PTHrP secretion
from breast cancer cells and consequently tumor cell growth
and bone resorption will be inhibited. Although our data
indicate that Gli2 is required for TGF-b regulation of PTHrP,

this does not exclude other signaling pathways in the regulation of Gli2 and PTHrP. In fact, Dennler and colleagues
recently demonstrated that a combination of Wnt and
TGF-b signaling regulates Gli2 transcription (24). Our current
efforts are aimed at identifying and characterizing Hh signaling-independent regulators of Gli2 expression in tumor cells
that have metastasized to bone.
Overall, this work demonstrates that Gli2 inhibition
reduces tumor growth and bone destruction, suggesting
that targeting Gli2 may be a valid approach to inhibit bone
metastases. Studies are on-going to determine pathways that
regulate Gli2 and PTHrP and to test the efficacy of smallmolecule inhibitors of Hh signaling that target downstream
of Hh receptors.
