BACKGROUND: B-cell translocation gene 3 (BTG3/ANA/APRO4) is a candidate tumor suppressor gene in some
malignancies. We report here that B-cell translocation gene 3 (BTG3) is transcriptionally down-regulated in prostate
cancer and the mechanism of inactivation is through promoter hypermethylation. METHODS: Prostate cancer and
normal cell lines were treated with different doses of genistein and 5-aza-20 -deoxycytidine (5Aza-C). BTG3 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in tissues and cell lines. Bisulfate-modified polymerase chain reaction, cloning and sequencing were used to examine
promoter methylation in tumor samples and cell lines. Enzyme activity/inhibition assays were done to check the
effect of genistein and 5Aza-C on DNA methyltransferases. ChIP assay was performed to analyze chromatin modifications caused by genistein treatment. RESULTS: BTG3 mRNA expression was down-regulated in cancer tissues and
cells. Genistein and 5Aza-C induced BTG3 mRNA expression in all PC cell lines. Complete methylation of BTG3 promoter in tumor samples and cancer cell lines was observed. Genistein and 5Aza-C treatment significantly decreased
promoter methylation, reactivating BTG3 expression. Genistein and 5Aza-C increased levels of acetylated histones 3,
4, histone 3 dimethylated at lysine 4, histone 3 trimethylated at lysine 4, and RNA polymerase II, decreased DNA
methyl transferase and methyl-binding domain protein 2 activity, and increased histone acetyl transferase (HAT) activity. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report to show that BTG3 is silenced in prostate cancer and can be reactivated
by genistein-induced promoter demethylation and active histone modification. Genistein showed similar effects to
that of 5Aza-C, which is currently undergoing phase 2 clinical trials as a treatment for prostate cancer. Because genistein is a natural, nontoxic, and dietary isoflavone, these results indicate that genistein is a novel, advantageous

Cell cycle progression is tightly controlled by the sequential activation of proliferative and antiproliferative genes. Imbalance in this control system can lead to malignant transformation. Initially, most cancers were thought to arise through activation of oncogenes. However, increasing evidence indicates that loss of function of tumor suppressor genes represents a
major route to tumor development. Extensive searches using diverse strategies have since led to the identification of several
antiproliferative genes including, for example, P53 and RB1, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDK), and, more
recently, the B-cell translocation genes (BTG1, BTG2, and BTG3).1-3
BTG3/ANA/APRO4 is a member of the antiproliferative BTG/Tob (transducer of ErbB2) gene family, which also
includes BTG1, BTG2/TIS21/PC3, Tob, Tob2, and PC3b.4 These proteins are characterized by a BTG1/APRO homology domain in their N-terminal regions, within which reside two highly conserved motifs, box A and box B. The BTG3
gene was isolated in a low-stringency cDNA library screening using BTG1 and BTG2 as probes.3 The protein also seemed

to be antiproliferative, as its introduction into NIH3T3
cells reduced BrdU incorporation.5 More recently, BTG3
was found to associate with and inhibit Src tyrosine
kinase in PC12 cells6 and a direct transcriptional target of
p53.7
The regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes is
complex and multilayered. Gene regulation may be
exerted at the level of initiation of transcription, after transcription, or through epigenetic events. Hypermethylation of DNA is a key epigenetic mechanism for the
silencing of many genes, including those for cell cycle
regulation, receptors, DNA repair, and apoptosis.8,9 It is
responsible for chromosome condensation and transcription repression.10,11 The second mechanism of epigenetic
transcriptional control results from histone modifications.
Although histone modification and DNA methylation are
both independent processes, they are also integrally
linked.12 For example, DNA methyl tranferases
(DNMTs) are known to recruit histone deacetylase
(HDAC), leading to histone deacetylation and transcriptional repression.13,14 In addition, MBDs can independently recruit HDACs to the site of DNA
methylation.15,16 Several in vitro studies have demonstrated that DNA methylation and histone deacetylation
may cooperate to repress gene transcription.17,18 The inhibition of DNMT, especially DNMT1, blocks the
hypermethylation of the newly synthesized DNA strand,
resulting in the reversal of hypermethylation and the reexpression of the silenced genes.14,19,20 Indeed, this point
has been demonstrated by studies with DNMT inhibitors,
DAC (also known as 5-aza-20 -deoxycytidine), and zebularine. These compounds have been shown to inhibit cancer cell growth, induce cancer cell apoptosis, and reduce
tumor volume in mice.21-24 There is a high potential for
developing this group of inhibitors for cancer therapy;
however, side effects and toxicity are serious concerns.
Therefore, there is a great need for the development of
effective, nontoxic inhibitors of promoter hypermethylation and histone deacetylation.
In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that
genistein can induce expression of BTG3 genes through
promoter demethylation and induction of active chromatin modifications in prostate cancer. We also investigated
the effect of genistein on various enzymatic activities
(DNMT, histone acetyl transferase [HAT], HDAC, and
methyl-binding domain protein 2 [MBD2]) that are
involved in promoter hypermethylation and histone modification in prostate cancer cell lines and compared the
results with that of 5Aza-C.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tissue Samples and Cell Culture
Tissue samples from radical prostatectomies were
obtained from the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San
Francisco, Calif. Informed consent was obtained from all
patients. A board certified pathologist processed the specimens according to protocol, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80 C.
Human prostate carcinoma cell lines (LNCaP,
PC3) and a normal epithelial prostate cell line (RWPE-1)
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, Va). The prostate cancer cell lines were
cultured as monolayers in RPMI medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, Utah),
50 ug/mL penicillin, 50 ug/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, Calif), and maintained in an incubator with a
humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 C.
The RWPE-1 cells were cultured in keratinocyte growth
medium supplemented with 5 ng/mL human recombinant epidermal growth factor, 0.05 mg/mL bovine pituitary extract (Gibco/Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif), and
maintained in an incubator under the conditions
described above. Subconfluent cells (60%-70% confluent) were treated with various concentrations of genistein
(0, 10, 25, and 50 umol/L; Sigma, St. Louis, Mo)
dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide or 5-Aza-20 -deoxycytidine
(5 umol/L; Sigma, St. Louis, Mo), and cells treated with
vehicle (dimethylsulfoxide) served as control. The cells
were treated with fresh genistein and 5Aza-C every day
along with change of media and grown for 3 days (genistein) or 5 days (5Aza-C).
RNA/DNA Extraction From Clinical Samples
and Cell Lines
Total ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted using a combination of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and RNeasy columns
(Qiagen, Valencia, Calif). Fresh prostate tissues, however,
were homogenized in 1mL TRIzol reagent. After the addition of 0.2 mL chloroform, samples were centrifuged for
15 minutes at 14000  rpm. The aqueous phase was moved
to a new centrifuge tube and resuspended with one half volume of 100% ethanol. Samples were then applied to an
RNeasy mini-column. For DNA digestion, an Ambion
DNA-Free kit was used according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. RNA quality was assessed using a NanoDrop
ND-1000 (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmingon, Del)
spectrophotometer. Extracted RNA was stored at 80 C.
Genomic DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded noncancerous and cancerous microdissected prostate

tissues, which were obtained from the Veterans Affairs
Medical Center, San Francisco. Genomic DNA was also
extracted from pathologically proven benign prostate
hypertrophy (BPH) samples. A DNA mini kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, Calif) was used to extract DNA from tissue
according to the manufacturer’s protocols.
Genomic DNA and RNA were extracted from 80%
confluent plates of cultured cells using AllPrep DNA/
RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif) according to the
manufacturer’s directions.
Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain
Reaction (PCR)
First strand cDNA was prepared from total RNA (1ug)
using the Reverse Transcription System (Promega Corp.
Madison, Wis).
In the real-time PCR step, cDNA was amplified
with Inventoried Gene Assay Products containing 2 genespecific primers and 1 TaqMan MGB probe (6-FAM
dye-labeled) using the TaqMan Universal Fast PCR Master Mix in a 7500 Fast Real Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, Calif). Thermal cycling conditions included 95 C for 20 seconds, 40 cycles of 95 C for
3 seconds, and 60 C for 30 seconds according to the TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Protocol. Glyceraldehyde 3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an
endogenous control and vehicle control was used as a
calibrator. Each sample was run in 4 wells. The comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method was used to calculate
the relative changes in gene expression in the 7500
Fast Real Time PCR System. The relative changes of
gene expression were calculated using the following
formula: Fold change in gene expression, 2DDCt ¼
2{(DCt genistein treated samples)(DCt untreated control)} where
DCt ¼ Ct (detected genes)-Ct (GAPDH) and Ct represents threshold cycle number.
Sodium Bisulfite Modification
and Sequencing
Bisulfite modification of DNA was performed using
the Epi-Tect Bisulfite kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif) following the manufacturer’s directions. The basic principle of bisulfite modification of DNA is that in the
bisulfite reaction, all unmethylated cytosines are deaminated and sulfonated, converting them to thymines,
while methylated cytonies (5-methylcytosines) remain
unaltered. Thus, the sequence of the treated DNA will
differ depending on whether the DNA is originally
methylated or unmethylated. Primers for bisulfite

68

genomic sequencing PCR were designed by using the
online program MethPrimer.25 All reactions for tissue
samples were subjected to 2 rounds of amplifications
using a nested primer approach. Bisulfite-modified
DNA (1 ul) was amplified using a primer pair in a
total volume of 20 ul. Aliquots (2 ul) of the first PCR
reactions were subjected to second round amplifications using a pair of nested primer pairs in a total volume of 30ul. The amplification products were
confirmed by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel and
sequenced directly by an outside vendor (McLab,
South San Francisco, Calif).
Cloning for Methylation Confirmation
Bisulfite modification of DNA from selected samples was
performed as described above. The modified DNA was
amplified using nested PCR with primer sets F1R1 and
F3R3 and the products were confirmed by electrophoresis.
Amplified products were cloned into the pCR2.1-Topo vector using TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
Calif). Ten to 15 colonies were randomly chosen for culture
and DNA was purified using PureLink Quick Plasmid
Miniprep Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif) and sequenced
by an outside vendor (Quintara Biosciences, Albany, Calif).
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) Analysis
ChIP analysis was performed using the EZ-ChIP kit (Upstate
Biotechnology, Charlottesville, Va) according to the manufacturer’s directions. Antibodies used in the immunoprecipitations were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology and
Ambion and were specific for acetyl histone H3 (06-599),
acetyl histone H4 (06-866), dimethyl-histone H3 lysine 4
(07-030), trimethyl-histone H3 lysine 4(07-473), dimethylhistone H3 lysine 9 (07-441), trimethyl-histone H3 lysine 9
(ab8898), and anti-RNA polymerase II (05-623). The
immunoprecipitated DNA was eluted in a total volume of
50 ul, and 2 ul were used for PCR, which was performed
with an annealing temperature of 60 C for a total of 28
cycles. The amplified DNA was electrophoresed in a 2% agarose gel and observed by staining with ethidium bromide.
The ImageJ Software version 1.36b (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/
ij/) was used for optical densitometry. For enrichment calculation, each sample was normalized with their respective
input samples and then the treated samples were compared
with their untreated controls for each used antibody. In short,
enrichment was calculated as the ratio between the net intensity of each bound sample normalized to its input sample and
the vehicle control sample normalized to vehicle control input

RESULTS
BTG3 Expression Profile
To determine relative expression levels of BTG3 in prostate cancer (PCa) cells, we performed TaqMan quantitative real-time PCR analysis for androgen-dependent
(LNCaP) and androgen-independent (PC3) cell lines and
compared them with normal prostate epithelial cells
(RWPE-1). We also compared the mRNA expression levels of tumor samples and normal tissue samples (Fig.
1A,C). The results showed that relative mRNA expression
was significantly lower in tumor samples and the PCa cell
line when compared with normal tissue samples and
RWPE-1 cells. These results show that BTG3 gene is transcriptionally down-regulated in prostate cancer.

Effect of Genistein and 5Aza-C Treatment on
the Expression of BTG3
Genistein significantly up-regulated the relative expression level of BTG3 in a dose dependent manner over vehicle control (Fig. 1B,D). Maximum increase was observed
with 50uM genistein (5-6 fold), followed by 25uM genistein (3-4 fold). 5Aza-C treatment also increased the
BTG3 mRNA expression level by 5-7 folds in both PCa
cell lines compared with vehicle control indicating that
BTG3 gene can be significantly induced by genistein and
5Aza-C treatment.
Methylation Status of BTG3 Promoter
To check whether transcriptional silencing of BTG3 gene
is due to promoter hypermethylation, we analyzed the status of promoter methylation for BTG3 in 10 pairs of tumor and normal tissue samples, 10 BPH samples, and cell
lines by bisulfite-modified PCR, followed by direct
sequencing of the modified DNA samples. We used

MethPrimer software25 to select primers in the CpG rich
region of the BTG3 promoter around the transcription
start site (Fig. 2A,B). Primers were designed with no CpG
sites in either the forward or reverse primer and, thus,
amplification proceeds in a manner unbiased by promoter
methylation status. Selected amplicons were subsequently
subcloned, and the recombinants were identified and subjected to automated DNA sequencing. Resulting sequences were compared with the parent promoter sequence
from which the clones were made and the methylation status of the CpG dinucleotides within this amplicon was
determined by characteristic chemical changes associated
with cytosines existing in either a methylated or an unmethylated state. DNA sequencing results revealed promoter
of the BTG3 gene in tumor samples was hypermethylated
in comparison to normal tissue samples (Fig. 3). Similar
results were observed in cell lines. The BTG3 promoter in
PCa cell lines was completely methylated, whereas there
was an absence of CpG island methylation in normal pros-

72

tate epithelial cells (RWPE-1) (Fig. 3). Genistein and
5Aza-C treatments significantly demethylated the hypermethylated BTG3 promoter (Fig. 4). These results indicate that transcriptional silencing of the BTG3 gene is due
to promoter hypermethylation, which can be reversed by
genistein and 5Aza-C treatments.
Enzymatic Activity Assays
We performed several enzyme activity assays related to
methylation and histone modifications. DNA methyltransferase activity was down-regulated by treatment with
50uM genistein and 5Aza-C in LNCaP and PC3 cells
(Fig. 5A). There were also decreased levels of DNMT proteins in genistein and 5Aza-C treated samples compared
with untreated controls. There was a significant decrease
(60 to 70%) in DNMT1 levels with 5Aza-C followed by
35% to 45% decrease by genistein over untreated control.
There were also decreased levels of DNMT3A and
DNMT3B in both prostate cancer cell lines (Fig. 5C).

We also checked the MBD2 binding activity in terms of
binding percent. MBD2 activity was decreased 80% and
40%-50% by 5Aza-C and genistein, respectively, compared with untreated controls (Fig. 5B). We also checked
HAT and HDAC activities. Genistein and 5Aza-C treatment increased HAT activity (Fig. 5D), whereas there was
no difference in HDAC activity with either 5Aza-C or
genistein except the PC3 cells, where 5Aza-C caused a
significant decrease in HDAC activity (Fig. 5D).
Changes in Chromatin Modifications
To determine whether there were changes in chromatin
structure at the BTG3 locus after genistein and 5Aza-C
treatment, we did ChIP analysis with various antibodies
as described in the Materials and Methods section. Genistein and 5Aza-C treatments resulted in enrichment of acetylated histones H3, H4, H3 dimethylated at lysine 4, and
H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 near the transcription start
sites in both LNCaP and PC3 cell lines (Fig. 6A,B). These
changes are markers of active modifications and indicative
of gene activation. Therefore, promoter demethylation by
genistein and 5Aza-C also correlated with active histone

Cancer

modifications at the transcription start site in both cell
lines.

DISCUSSION
The hypermethylation of DNA is a key epigenetic mechanism for the silencing of many genes including tumor suppressors, DNA repair enzymes, and receptors.8,9 In recent
years, the list of tumor suppressor genes that are inactivated by epigenetic rather than classical mutation/deletion
events has been growing.26 Unlike mutational inactivation, methylation is reversible and demethylating agents
and inhibitors of histone deacetylases are being used in
clinical trials.26 Our study clearly demonstrates that genistein causes CpG demethylation, inhibition of DNMTase
and MBD2 activity and reactivation of the methylationsilenced BTG3 gene. To our knowledge, this is the first
time that such a role for genistein has been reported in
prostate cancer.
Gene inactivation by DNA methylation is an important mechanism in prostate cancer and is involved in the
inactivation of several essential genes such as E-cadherin,27 MDR1,28 and glutathione S-transferase P1.29

Our results showed that the BTG3 gene is hypermethylated in both prostate cancer cell lines and tumor samples
compared with normal cell lines and tissues. Promoter hypermethylation subsequently led to the transcriptional
repression of the BTG3 gene (Fig. 1A,C). Yamamoto
et al.30 have also reported that the BTG3 gene is silenced
by hypermethylation in primary oral squamous cell carcinomas. In theory, this epigenetic process is reversible if
newly synthesized DNA strands are not methylated.
Therefore, DNMT inhibitors such as 5Aza-C and zebularine have been actively investigated as cancer therapeutic
agents.21,22 However, side effects and toxicity are serious
concerns. So, we used genistein, a natural, nontoxic, and
dietary isoflavone and compared its effect with 5Aza-C.
Our results revealed that genistein significantly induced
BTG3 mRNA levels, and its effects were similar to that of
5Aza-C in both androgen dependent (LNCaP) and independent (PC3) cell lines (Fig. 1B,D). This is consistent

74

with other reports that have shown that genistein up-regulated mRNA expression of the BRAC1 gene, p16INK4a,
RARb, MGMT genes, and p16INK4a, p21CIP1/WIF1.31
BTG3/ANA/APRO4 is thought to be negative regulator of cell cycle, which is expressed highly in late G1
phase before the entry of the cells in S phase.3 It has been
found that its antiproliferative action is through the inhibition of transcription factor E2F1 that, in turn, controls
the cell cycle by activating genes important for G1/S progression, which includes the genes for cyclin E, PCNA,
DNA polymerase a, Cdc6 dihydrofolate reductase, and
others.7 More recently, BTG3 was found to associate with
and inhibit Src tyrosine kinase.6 Other studies have shown
that BTG3 gene is a candidate tumor suppressor gene in
human nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line and in oral
squamous cell carcinomas.30
It is well known that the predominant consequence
of methylation is transcriptional repression, and we found

Cancer

January 1, 2010

BTG3 Modulation in Prostate Cancer/Majid et al

that CpG islands in the promoter of the BTG3 gene were
hypermethylated in cancer cell lines and tumor samples
(Fig. 3A,B). Treatment with 50uM genistein caused demethylation of these sites, though to a lesser extent than that of
5Aza-C (Fig. 4). Direct inhibition of transcription may be
through blocking the binding of transcription factors to
promoters containing methylated CpG sites,32 while indirect repression may involve proteins such as MePC2 that
specifically bind to methylated DNA via a methyl-CpGbinding domain.33 It is likely that inhibition of DNMT
and enhanced histone acetylation can also prevent the hypermethylation. The prevention of intestinal tumorigenesis
by Dnmt1 deficiency and 5Aza-C has been demonstrated in
Min mice, which carry a mutated Apc gene.34 Our enzymatic activity assays revealed that genistein and 5Aza-C
treatment inhibited DNA methyltransferase, decreased
MBD2 binding, and increased HAT activity (Fig. 5). The
5Aza-C is a potent inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase
enzyme (DNMTase) activity, through irreversible binding
of DNMTs to 5-aza-20 -deoxycytidine-substituted DNA.35
DNMTs catalyze the methylation of genomic DNA, which
include DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B. Our current results showed a significant decrease in DNMT1 protein levels by genistein and 5Aza-C treatments (Fig. 5C). A
decrease in DNMT3A and DNMT3B was also observed
but to a lesser extent.
Another important epigenetic event is chromatin
modification. There are reports that show that hyperacetylation of histone lysine residues facilitates transcriptional activation36 and induction of gene expression.37
Our results revealed that both genistein and 5Aza-C
caused enrichment of active chromatin modifications near
the transcription start site of the BTG3 gene in both
LNCaP and PC3 cell lines (Fig. 6A,B).
In conclusion, our study is the first report to show
that the tumor suppressor gene BTG3 is epigenetically
silenced in prostate cancer and can be reactivated by genistein induced promoter demethylation and active histone
modification. Furthermore, genistein showed similar effects
to that of 5Aza-C, which is currently undergoing phase 2
clinical trials as a treatment for prostate cancer. Because genistein is a natural, nontoxic, and dietary isoflavone, these
results indicate that genistein may be a novel, advantageous
therapeutic agent for treating prostate cancer.
