ABSTRACT
An attractive molecular target for novel anti-cancer therapies is the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
pathway which is commonly deregulated in many types of cancer. Nevertheless, the
effects of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors on T lymphocytes, a key component of immune
responses, have been seldom explored. In this study we investigated the effects on
human CD4+ T-cells of a panel of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors: BGT226, Torin-2, MK2206, and ZSTK474. We also assessed their efficacy against two acute leukemia T
cell lines. T lymphocytes were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin. Inhibitor effects
on cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry, while cytotoxicity was
assessed by MTT assays. In addition, the activation status of the pathway as well as
induction of autophagy were analyzed by Western blotting.
Quiescent healthy T lymphocytes were unaffected by the drugs whereas mitogenstimulated lymphocytes as well as leukemic cell lines displayed a cell cycle block,
caspase-dependent apoptosis, and dephosphorylation of key components of the
signaling pathway. Autophagy was also induced in proliferating lymphocytes and in
JURKAT and MOLT-4 cell lines. When autophagy was inhibited by 3-methyladenine
or Bafilomycin A1, drug cytotoxicity was increased, indicating that autophagy is a
protective mechanism.
Therefore, our findings suggest that PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors preserve
lymphocyte viability. This is a valuable result to be taken into account when selecting
drugs for targeted cancer therapy in order to minimize detrimental effects on immune
function.

activated by several stimuli regulating cell proliferation

physiological conditions [1].

INTRODUCTION
The phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt/mTOR
(PI3K/Akt/mTOR) signal transduction pathway is

PI3K comprises a family of lipid kinases which
phosphorylate the 3-OH group of inositol lipids. They are
classified into Class I, II, and III based on primary structure
and regulation. Class I PI3Ks are heterodimeric enzymes,
displaying a catalytic and a regulatory subunit. The catalytic
subunits comprise p110α, p110β, p110γ, and p110δ, which
associate in different ways with the regulatory subunits
(p85α, p85β, and p55γ, p101, p84, and p87PIKAP) [2].
Akt requires phosphorylation of both Ser473 and
Thr308 amino acidic residues to be fully activated and
regulates several downstream, processes including positive
activation/regulation of mTOR functions [3].
mTOR is a 289-kDa serine/threonine protein kinase,
which regulates cell growth. mTOR is the catalytic subunit
of two multi-protein complexes: complex 1 (mTORC1)
and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2).
mTORC1 is responsive towards growth factors,
nutrients, energy, or oxidative stress and phosphorylates
4E-BP1 and S6K which are important for protein
translation. mTORC2 phosphorylates Akt at the Ser473
residue for complete activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway. Other downstream substrates of mTORC2
include PKC [4, 5].
T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)
is a malignant disease of T lymphocytes progenitors,
characterized by the accumulation of immature
undifferentiated thymocytes that acquired multiple genetic
aberrations. This results in a poor prognosis, especially
for relapsed patients [6]. Aberrant regulation of the PI3K/
Akt/mTOR axis often confers a proliferative advantage to
tumor cells and contributes to the development of drugresistance mechanisms.
At present only class I PI3Ks have been shown to be
associated with cancer: indeed PIK3CA, the gene which
encodes for p110α PI3K, is mutated in a variety of tumor
types [7–9]. Mutations of the p85 subunit have also been
shown to be oncogenic [10, 11].
The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is
frequently up-regulated in T-ALL. This is due to several
causes, including phosphorylation, oxidation and gene
mutation/deletion, which affect PTEN phosphatase
function [12, 13].
Thus, targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis represents
an attractive novel therapeutic strategy for T-ALL.
However, which drug against one or more members of this
signaling network can achieve the greater efficacy is still
an open question.
To address this issue we employed a
pharmacological approach aimed to compare the efficacy
of four drugs, one targeting mTORC1/C2 (Torin-2) [14,
15], one against PI3K/mTORC1/C2 (NVP-BGT226)
[16, 17], one targeting Akt (MK-2206) [18–21], and the
fourth one directed against all the class I PI3K isoforms
(ZSTK474) [22–24].
Only a limited number of studies have analyzed
the impact of PI3K/Akt/mTOR network inhibitors on
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

human T-cells. The few published data have been mainly
focused only on PI3K inhibitors, such as wortmannin and
LY294002 [25] or pan class I PI3K inhibitors [26] or drugs
targeting selectively p110δ [27, 28] or p110α [24].
Drugs targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR cascade can
interfere with diverse biologic processes also in healthy
cells, thus rising concerns about their use in therapeutics.
In particular, it is essential to gain knowledge about
their effect on immune cells, as it would be desirable to
preserve patient’s immunity.
The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of
the four above mentioned drugs in human primary CD4+
T-cells. most of these inhibitors are currently being tested
in clinical trials. We have assessed the anti-tumor activity
of NVP-BGT226 (BGT226), Torin-2, MK-2206 and
ZSTK474 in human T-ALL cells and studied their effects
on healthy CD4+ T-cell, induced or not to proliferate.
Our findings suggested that, to minimize off-target
effects and to benefit from the optimal response, selective
inhibitors targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR may represent a
new promising treatment for T-ALL patients, since they
showed a strong cytotoxicity against leukemic T-cells or
T-lymphocytes stimulated to proliferate, whereas they did
not compromise viability of quiescent healthy CD4+ T
lymphocytes.

RESULTS
Activation status of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway
in healthy CD4+ T lymphocytes and T-ALL cell
lines
By Western blot analysis, we wanted to evaluate
the baseline levels of some key proteins involved in the
PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis in both unstimulated and stimulated
healthy CD4+ T lymphocytes and in T-ALL cells (MOLT4 and JURKAT cell lines). We decided to study CD4+
cells as they are helper cells that play important roles for
regulating immunological responses [29].
Stimulated T lymphocytes, MOLT-4 and JURKAT
cells showed a relevant phosphorylation at Ser473 and
Thr308 of Akt and at Ser235/236 of ribosomal protein S6
kinase, a readout of mTORC1 activity. The same cell types
also displayed mTOR phosphorylation at Ser2448 and
Ser2481 residues, readout for mTORC1 and mTORC2,
respectively. The phosphorylation was not evident in
unstimulated CD4+ T lymphocytes (Figure 1).

BGT226, Torin-2, MK-2206 and ZSTK474
are cytostatic and cytotoxic to stimulated
T lymphocytes and T-ALL cell lines
BGT226 is an ATP-competitive dual PI3K/
mTORC1/2 inhibitor used for treatment of advanced solid
tumors [30, 31]. As previously reported by our group, it
was cytotoxic to a panel of hepatocarcinoma cell lines,
55691

under both normoxia and hypoxia conditions [32]. Torin-2
potently targets mTORC1/2, and is an effective inhibitor
of ATM, ATR and DNA-PK [14].
The efficacy of MK-2206 as well as ZSTK474
have been tested in various preclinical models of human
cancers, including leukemias [3, 19, 22, 33–36].
To determine how these inhibitors could affect
the viability of the primary CD4+ T lymphocytes (both
unstimulated and stimulated) and T-ALL cells, we
performed MTT assays. Cells were incubated for 48 h
with the inhibitors, and then cell survival was analyzed
(Figure 2A and Table 1). Except for the unstimulated T
lymphocytes, BGT226 and the mTORC1/2 inhibitor
Torin-2 turned out to be the most powerful drugs in
these cells. For unstimulated T lymphocytes, there was
no relevant inhibition for both drugs (IC50 > 2 μM). For
BGT226, cell viability impairment was more evident
in T-ALL cell lines, with IC50 values of 0.08 μM for
JURKAT, 0.06 μM for MOLT-4 and 1.61 μM for
stimulated T lymphocytes. Similar results were obtained
with Torin-2, with IC50 values of 0.1 μM for JURKAT and
MOLT-4 and 1.8 μM for stimulated T-cells.
Regarding MK-2206, the cells displayed higher
values of IC50 (> 2 μM) except for MOLT-4 cells with
an IC50 of 1.58 μM. For ZSTK474 the same resistance
for the primary T lymphocytes was observed, while in
MOLT-4 and JURKAT cell lines the sensitivity of the drug
was evident, with IC50 values of 0.52 μM and 0.95 μM,
respectively. The IC50 of stimulated T lymphocytes was
> 2 μM (Table 1).

To further assess the cytotoxicity of inhibitors
targeting PI3K/Akt/mTOR, we analyzed the changes in
cell viability using flow cytometry after treatment with
1μM of each drug for 48 h. Compared to MK-2206
and ZSTK474, BGT226 and Torin-2 displayed higher
cytotoxic effect on stimulated T lymphocytes, MOLT-4
and JURKAT cells. None of the drugs affected the viability
of unstimulated CD4+ T lymphocytes (Figure 2B). For all
these reasons, for the subsequent experiments we decided
to test only BGT226 and Torin-2.
Considering the important role of the PI3K/
Akt/mTOR signaling cascade in regulating cell
proliferation [37], we investigated the effect of the drugs
on cell cycle progression. Cells were treated with the two
most effective drugs (BGT226 and Torin-2) for 24 h and
stained with Propidium Iodide (PI) for flow cytometric
analysis. A concentration dependent increase of cells in the
G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and a concomitant decrease
in cells of both S and G2/M phase were observed (Figure
3). The increase was highly significant in stimulated T
lymphocytes, MOLT-4 and JURKAT cells, whereas did
not occur in unstimulated T lymphocytes.

BGT226 and TORIN-2 down-regulate the
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in stimulated CD4+ T
lymphocytes and T-ALL cells
To determine whether BGT226 and Torin-2 could
affect factors that promote cell survival, stimulated T
lymphocytes, MOLT-4 and JURKAT cells were treated

BGT226 and TORIN-2 induce autophagy

with increasing concentrations of BGT226 and Torin-2
for 2 h and then analyzed by Western blot (Figure 4).
The inhibition of mTORC2 had a readout in Ser473 Akt
dephosphorylation and it was observed in all cell types
treated with BGT226 and Torin-2 starting from the
lowest concentrations. Thr308 Akt was dephosphorylated
by both drugs, as was GSK3β Ser21/9, an Akt
substrate. The mTORC1 substrate S6 was completely
dephosphorylated on Ser235/236 residue, already at the
lowest concentrations of BGT226 and Torin-2. Both drugs
downregulated the phosphorylation levels of mTOR at
both Ser2448 and Ser2481 residues [38].

Autophagy plays a very important role in cell
physiology, either as a form of cell death or as a protective
mechanism against apoptosis [39, 40]. Therefore, there is a
growing interest on the pharmacological approaches aimed
to regulate autophagy, which represent a new area for the
development of therapeutics protocols. Moreover, over the
last few years various papers described the occurrence of
autophagy in acute leukemia cells [reviewed in 42]. To find
out if BGT226 and Torin-2 could induce autophagy, we
analyzed the expression levels of microtubule-associated

Values are expressed in μM
protein 1 light chain 3 LC3A/B I (non-lipidated form) and
of its conjugated form LC3A/B II (lipidated). After 24 h
of treatment with BGT226 and Torin-2, the unstimulated
T lymphocytes showed no expression of LC3A/B II
which, in contrast, increased gradually in a concentration
dependent manner, for both drugs, especially in MOLT4 and JURKAT cells (Figure 5A). We also analyzed
the expression of p62, another marker of autophagy.
p62 levels decreased in response to drug treatments in
stimulated CD4+ lymphocytes and leukemic cell lines, but
remained unchanged in quiescent T-cells (Figure 5A).
To establish whether autophagy was either a
cell death or survival mechanism, we employed the
autophagy inhibitor 3-Methyladenine (3-MA), which
inhibits autophagy by blocking class III PI3K [41]. We
also used Bafilomycin A1, another autophagy inhibitor,
to further assess the mechanism of drug cytotoxicity. We
treated stimulated T lymphocytes and JURKAT cells with
BGT226, Torin-2, 3-MA or Bafilomycin A1 alone and
in combination for 24 h. Results showed that 3-MA or
Bafilomycin A1 alone did not affect cell viability, even
at high concentrations (10 μM or 4 μM, respectively).
On the other hand, when 3-MA or Bafilomycin A1 were
administered with 0.25 μM BGT226 or Torin-2, the cells
became more sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of both
drugs (Figure 5B and 5C). These findings highlighted a
protective role of autophagy from cytotoxicity induced by
BGT226 and Torin-2 in stimulated T-lymphocytes and in
JURKAT cell line.

for apoptosis. In contrast, significant cleavage of PARP
was observed, especially in stimulated T lymphocytes, but
also in MOLT-4 and JURKAT cells (Figure 6A).
To elucidate whether caspases were involved in the
apoptotic activity of BGT226 and Torin-2, we analyzed the
effect of z-VAD-fmk, a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor
whose activity had been checked already in different
cancer cells [44, 45]. We administrated z-VAD-fmk alone
and in combination with BGT226 or Torin-2 for 24 h in
stimulated T lymphocytes and MOLT-4 cells, then cells
were analyzed by MTT assays. Results showed that
z-VAD-fmk (25 μM) alone had no relevant effect on cell
viability, however when combined with BGT226 and
Torin-2, it significantly inhibited apoptosis mediated by
both drugs, in stimulated T lymphocytes and MOLT-4
cells. Thus, these findings indicated that BGT226 and
Torin-2 induced a caspase-dependent apoptosis (Figure
6B).
We also measured caspase 3/7 activation by
enzymatic cleavage of the profluorescent substrate
rhodamine 110, bis-N-CBZ-L-aspartyl-Lglutaml- L-valylL-aspartic acid amide (Z-DEVD-R110), with release of
the intensely fluorescent rhodamine 110-cleaving group
[46]. The activity of caspase 3/7 was increased after
drug treatment and was down-modulated by z-VAD-fmk
(Figure 6C).
Furthermore, we studied drug-induced apoptosis
using Annexin-V staining in stimulated T lymphocytes,
MOLT-4 and JURKAT cell lines treated with BGT226
or Torin-2 for 24 h. BGT226 effect was more relevant in
MOLT-4 and stimulated T lymphocytes than in JURKAT
cells, while the effect of Torin-2 was stronger in MOLT4 and JURKAT cells than in stimulated T lymphocytes
(Figure 7A). The percentages of live, early and late
apoptotic cells in response to treatment with BGT226 and
Torin-2 (0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 μM) are shown in Figure 7B.

Apoptosis is required for mediating BGT226 and
Torin-2 cytotoxicity
Previous studies documented that in T-ALL cells
BGT226 could induce apoptosis [42]. In addition, our
recent results demonstrated that Torin-2 is effective in
Pre-B precursor-ALL cells [43]. In order to establish
whether decreased viability was due to apoptosis,
unstimulated and stimulated T lymphocytes as well as
MOLT4 and JURKAT cell lines, were incubated with
increasing concentrations of BGT226 and Torin-2 for
24 h, then Western blot was performed for analyzing the
expression levels of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP).
The unstimulated T lymphocytes displayed no evidence

DISCUSSION
Although preclinical studies have demonstrated that
inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis could be an effective
strategy for targeted therapy of T-ALL [47, 48], it is still
unclear which is the best target in this highly complex and
branched signaling network. Pharmaceutical companies

have synthesized a wide array of drugs, that target
different components of this signaling parthway [49, 50].
This allows to envisage different strategies based on one
side on the use of selective inhibitors displaying reduced

adverse effects, and on the other side pan-inhibitors
expected to exert a greater efficacy.
It has been recently documented that PI3K inhibitors
were the most effective in inhibiting leukemic cell
proliferation and survival in a panel of T-ALL human

cell lines, irrespectively of PTEN status. These findings
strongly supporting clinical application of class I PI3K
pan-inhibitors rather than dual γ/δ or single-isoform
inhibitors for treatment of the majority of T-ALL patients
[51].
Nevertheless, the functions of the immune system
cells could be impaired by these drugs. Here we evaluated
the effects on human healthy CD4+ T-cells of four
PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors used as anticancer agents,
to explore how these treatments could affect the patient
immunological status.
No cytotoxic effects were displayed by the drugs
on unstimulated CD4+ T lymphocytes, whereas all the
inhibitors and particularly BGT226 and Torin-2 reached
IC50 values in the nanomolar range in T-ALL cells.

In consideration of these findings, we performed the
following sets of experiments using only BGT226 and
Torin-2.
As to the cell cycle, since the unstimulated CD4+ T
lymphocytes are mostly in a quiescent status, the drugs did
not exert any effect, thus demonstrating the selectivity of
the inhibitors.
In contrast, in either stimulated CD4+ T-lymphocytes
or MOLT4 and JURKAT cell lines, BGT226 and Torin-2
induced a concentration-dependent accumulation in the
G0/G1 phase, and a concomitant decrease in S and G2-M
phases, as reported by others [52–54].
As shown by Western blot, Torin-2 and BGT226
effectively blocked the phosphorylation of Akt Ser 473
and Thr308, GSK3β Ser21/9, mTORC1 Ser2448 and

mTORC2 Ser2481. Furthermore, an mTORC1
downstream target, S6 protein, was fully dephosphorylated
in both stimulated T lymphocytes and T-ALL cells.
Healthy unstimulated CD4+ T lymphocytes did not
display induction of autophagy as documented by Western
blot analysis of LC3A/B. Stimulated T lymphocytes
appeared more sensitive to induction of autophagy when
compared to unstimulated ones. We also documented
that in leukemic cells the induction of autophagy was
a protective mechanism, since cells incubated with

autophagy inhibitors were less viable. Similar results were
obtained in stimulated T lymphocytes.
The drugs also induced apoptosis in both stimulated
T lymphocytes and leukemic cells. On the contrary, resting
T lymphocytes did not undergo apoptosis. The apoptotic
cell death was dependent on caspase activity. Therefore,
apoptosis is one of the mechanisms that explain the
cytotoxicity of these drugs.
It is now assumed that tumor growth and survival
can be either promoted or restrained by immune system

cells [55, 56]. Therefore, it is critical to define whether
novel anti-tumor drugs may impact on cells of the immune
system. The ideal targeted therapy should specifically
hit cancer cells and enhance anti-tumor immunity while
preserving patient immunity [24].
It has been demonstrated that lymphocyte functions
were minimally affected by p110α inhibition both in
vitro and in vivo. Although p110α inhibition partially
diminished Akt activation, it is likely that selective p110α
inhibitors will be less immunosuppressive in vivo than
p110δ or pan PI3K class I inhibitors [24].
Natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity as well as
antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity against tumor
cells were significantly impaired by pan class I PI3K
inhibitors, whereas p110α selective drugs had no effect
[51, 57].
Other authors have shown recently that single
inhibitors of class I PI3K isoforms in T-lymphocytes
exerted a less potent impairment of T-cell activation than
simultaneous inhibition of two or more isoforms [54].
These results suggest that complete blockade of class I
PI3K activity strongly impairs T lymphocyte proliferation
and activation in vitro.
In addition, it has been demonstrated that two ATPcompetitive PI3K pan-class I inhibitors, PX-866 and
BKM120, showed differences in their ability to block
T-lymphocytes proliferation and IL-2 secretion [26].
Nevertheless, these investigations were restricted
only to pan class I PI3K isoform inhibitors and did not
explore other drugs, such as Torin-2 and BGT226, which
target to additional components of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
axis.
Therefore our data expanded the concept that
targeted therapies, using different drugs against molecules
at different levels of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR cascade,
may be effective against tumor cells harboring aberrant
upregulation of this signaling network, without affecting
at the same time the immune system.
Given the commonly observed dysregulation of
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in T-ALL, the various types of
single or dual pathway inhibitors under development might
be effective in T-ALL treatment, provided that they do
not affect the immune system. Therefore, the study of the
effects of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibition not only in tumor
cells, but in immune cells as well, may lead to selection
of treatments that, while efficiently targeting deregulated
PI3K/Akt/mTOR signals in tumor cells, preserve normal
immune function, for appropriately tuning of personalized
cancer therapy.

Cell culture and Western blot analysis
Cell lines
T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines obtained
from Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und
Zellkulturen GmbH (Braunschweig, Germany). JURKAT
and MOLT-4 were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml
streptomycin at a density of 0.5 to 2 x 106 cells/ml and
were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2.
Primary samples
Peripheral Blood CD4+ T lymphocytes from healthy
donors were obtained with informed consent according to
institutional guidelines and isolated with Ficoll-Paque and
magnetic beads labelling protocols (Dynabeads, Monza
MI, Italy). Whole blood or buffy coat were diluted with
PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.6% Na-citrate or 2 mM
EDTA (without Ca2+ and Mg2+) in ratio 1:1. Thirty-five
ml of the diluted sample were layered over 15 ml of FicollPaque medium and centrifuged at 600 g for 40 minutes
at 20°C. The peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PMNC)
layer was transferred to centrifuge tube containing three
volumes of PBS and centrifuged at 100 g for 10 minutes
at 20°C. This step was repeated twice, supernatant was
discarded and cells were suspended in complete RPMI1640 medium.
500 μl PMNC were transferred into a test tube, at
a density of 5 x 107 cells/ml supplemented with100 μl of
heat inactivated FBS and antibody mix and incubated at
4°C for 20 minutes. Followed by addition of 4 ml isolation
buffer and centrifuged at 350 g at 4°C for 8 minutes.
The supernatant discarded, and the pelleted cells were
suspended in 500 μl of isolation buffer, added with 500
μl of pre-warmed dynabeads and incubated for 15 min at
20°C. The cells bound to beads were resuspended using

4 ml isolation buffer. The supernatant containing the
human CD4+ T lymphocytes was obtained by placing the
resuspended cells in magnet for 2 minutes. The human
CD4+ T lymphocytes were grown in complete RPMI-1640
medium with 10μg/ml phytohemagglutinin at a density of
1 x 106 cells/ml, in a CO2 incubator at 37°C for 24 h [58,
59].

L-valyl-L-aspartic acid amide (Z-DEVD-R110), which
releases the intensely fluorescent rhodamine 110-cleaving
group. Cells were seeded at a density of 1×105/ml and
incubated in a 96-well plate in the presence or absence
of drug for 48 h. For cells treated with a combination of
z-VAD-fmk and drugs, they were initially treated with
z-VAD-fmk for 4 h prior to the addition of drugs. 100
μl of the homogeneous caspase-3/-7 reagent was added
to each well and the reaction mixture was incubated for
2 h at room temperature. Fluorescence was measured
at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission
wavelength of 538 nm. Results are expressed as relative
fluorescence units (RFU).

Western blot
The cells were homogenized for 30 min in cold
lysis buffer (50 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA pH
8.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 20
mM β-glicerophosphate, 0.5% NP40, 0.1 mM sodium
orthovanadate, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM DTT) containing the
protease inhibitor cocktail obtained from Roche Applied
Science Basel, Switzerland. Lysates were centrifuged in
a Microfuge for 10 min at 4°C and 25 μg of solubilized
proteins were resolved by 10% or 12% SDS-PAGE [60,
61].

Statistical evaluation
The data are presented as mean values from three
separate experiments ± SD. Data were statistically
analyzed by a Dunnet test after one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) at a level of significance of P<0.05 vs
control samples [64].

Cell viability analysis
MTT
(3-[4,5-Dimethylthythiazol-2-yl]-2,5Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide) assays were performed to
assess the sensitivity of cells to drugs, as described [62,
63].

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Cell cycle analysis was performed using the Muse™
Cell Analyzer (Merck Millipore, Milan, Italy). Cells
were harvested after 24 h of treatment with the drugs,
centrifuged at 300 g for 5 minutes and washed with 1x
PBS. The cells were then fixed with 70% cold ethanol for
3h at -20°C, centrifuged at 300 g for 5 min and washed
with 1x PBS. Each sample was then resuspended in 200
μl of Muse™ Cell Cycle reagent, incubated in the dark for
30 min at room temperature, and analyzed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The analysis of apoptosis was
performed by Annexin V/7-ADD-Assay. The cells treated
with increasing concentrations of BGT226 or Torin-2 were
harvested after 24 h. The cell suspension was labeled in
the dark for 20 min with an equal volume (100 μl) of the
Muse™ Annexin-V Dead cell reagent (Merck Millipore).
Subsequently, quantitative detection of Annexin-V/7AAD positive cells was performed using the Muse™ Cell
Analyzer.
