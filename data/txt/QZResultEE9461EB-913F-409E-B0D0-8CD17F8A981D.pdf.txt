Abstract:

Tumor initiating or cancer stem cells (CSCs) are suggested to be responsible for
tumor initiation and growth. Moreover, therapy resistance and minimal residual
disease are thought to result from selective resistance of CSCs. Isolation of CSCs
from colon carcinomas can be accomplished by selection of a subpopulation
of tumor cells based on expression of one or multiple cell surface markers
associated with cancer stemness, like CD133, CD44, CD24, CD29, CD166 and
Lgr5. Identification of colon CSCs will lead to a better rational for new therapies
that aim to target this fraction specifically. In this review, we analyze known
markers used for selection of colon CSCs and their potential function in CSC
biology. Moreover, we discuss potential targeting strategies for eradicating CSCs
specifically in order to develop more effective therapeutic strategies as well as to
address more fundamental questions like the actual role of CSCs in tumor growth.

INTRODUCTION

able to serially transplant the tumor in vivo; secondly,
the tumors that grow out from the CSCs should resemble
the original malignancy; thirdly, CSCs should be able
to differentiate in marker-negative cells. To determine
the CSC-frequency, in vivo limiting dilution assays
(LDA) are performed, which means that several dilutions
and multiple replicates of marker-positive or markernegative cancer cells are injected subcutaneously in
(immunodeficient) mice. Cell surface markers that have
been used for identification of colon CSCs are CD44 [1820], CD133 [14-17], CD166 [20], whereas expression of
CD24 [17], CD29 [17] and Lgr5 [21] has also been found
in colon CSCs. More functional markers like Wnt activity
[22] and ALDH1 activity [23] have been exploited as well.
Through identification of CSCs in colon cancer, more
can be learned about the role of these cells in initiating
and driving tumor growth. In this review, we examine
the markers used for colon CSC identification and their
possible function, as well as methods to target these CSCs
specifically, both at therapeutic as wells as at a more
fundamental level.

Tumors have long been viewed as a population in
which all cells have the equal propensity to form new
tumors, the so called conventional stochastic model.
New insight was obtained when a small subset was
discovered in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [1,2] that
retained the ability to serially transplant. Since then, a
new hierarchical model was born, claiming that tumors
consist of a small fraction of so called tumor initiating
cells, also referred to as cancer stem cells (CSCs) that are
capable of initiating and maintaining tumor growth and
a large fraction of more differentiated cells, which are
incapable of maintaining tumor growth. After discovering
these CSCs in hematological malignancies, their presence
was also found in several solid tumors, like breast [3-5],
lung [6], ovarian [7], liver [8], prostate [9], pancreas [10],
skin [11], brain [12,13] and colon cancer [14-17], which
will be the focus of this review. To prove the presence
of CSCs within a tumor, several main criteria have been
established by the scientific community: firstly, CSCs,
identified by a specific cell surface marker, should be

MARKERS USED TO IDENTIFY COLON
CSC

instance, normal colon stem cells can be identified by
the activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1), a
detoxifying enzyme that oxidizes intracellular aldehydes,
therefore involved in the resistance to alkylating enzymes.
ALDH1 activity can be measured by a method using
dansyl aminoacetaldehyde and staining for ALDH1
revealed a few positive cells in the crypt [23]. In addition,
when colon cancer cells were selected for ALDH1 activity
using Aldeflour, ALDH1+ cells were able to initiate new
tumors whereas ALDH1- cells were not [23], indicating
that ALDH1 activity can be used as a colon CSC marker.
Besides the ALDH1 activity, recent evidence
indicates that Wnt signaling activity can serve as a
functional designation of colon CSCs [22]. Activating
mutations in the Wnt pathway are pivotal in the initiation
of the majority of colon cancers. However, recent evidence
indicates that a clear heterogeneity in Wnt signaling still
exists within separate cells within a colon cancer [33,34].
Interestingly, colon cancer cells with high Wnt activity
express stem cell markers and have higher clonogenic
capacity and tumorgenicity, whereas cells with low Wnt
activity express higher levels of differentiation markers
and are unable to give rise to new tumors [22]. In this light,
it is interesting to note that Lgr5 is a Wnt target gene [35],
exclusively expressed on the normal intestinal stem cells
[36] and could thus also be a CSC marker. Interestingly,
human colon CSCs were found to express Lgr5 [22]. In
addition, tumorigenesis in mice is much more effective in
Lgr5+ stem cells as compared to more differentiated cells
[21]. However, formal evidence that Lgr5 identifies colon
CSCs is still lacking and awaits the generation of reliable
antibodies that can be used to isolate Lgr5+ tumor cells.

The five-transmembrane glycoprotein CD133 is one
of the first colon CSCs markers identified and its use as a
CSC marker has been controversial since then. Selecting
colon cancer cells based on positivity for AC133, an
epitope on the CD133 protein, identifies the tumorigenic
and clonogenic population [14-17,24]. On the other hand,
CD133 expression was found throughout the normal
gastro-intestinal tract and therefore does not seem to be
restricted to the stem cell compartment [25,26]. In addition,
CD133+ as well as CD133- metastatic colon cancer cells
were shown to be able to form new tumors, indicating
that usage of CD133 as a CSC marker is questionable
[26]. In this light, it is important to note two things. First,
CD133 expression can be regulated by hypermethylating
the CpG island in the CD133 promoter region, an event
that frequently occurs in higher grade tumors and results
in CD133 downregulation independent from its potential
role in CSCs [27]. Secondly, the CD133 mRNA or surface
expression is not changed during differentiation [24,28].
Instead the AC133 epitope is masked and inaccessible for
the antibody in differentiated colon cancer cells, likely
due to a difference in the glycosylation status and folding
of the protein [24]. In agreement, the epitope can be reexposed by certain treatments, potentially explaining
different outcomes in immunohistochemical stainings
[24,26]. Although CD133 can be used as a CSC marker, it
therefore should be done with caution.
The transmembrane glycoprotein CD44 has been
used as a marker to isolate CSCs from multiple solid
tumors, such as breast [3], head and neck [29], pancreas
[30] and also colon cancer [31].Colon cancer cells sorted
for CD44+ displayed high tumorigenicity, especially in
combination with CD133-positivity, whereas CD44- cells
could not form new tumors in immunodeficient mice
[19,20]. CD44 can also be used in combination with
mesenchymal stem cell marker CD166 (also referred to
as ALCAM). CD44+CD166+ colon cancer cells display
a higher ability to form tumors in immunodeficient mice
as compared to CD44+CD166-, CD44-CD166- or CD44CD166- cell populations [20], making this an useful
combination for the identification of colon CSCs.
In normal colon, integrin subunit β1 (CD29)
expression was observed in the lower parts of the crypt and
thereby seems to mark a more stem/progenitor cell type
[32]. Moreover, the combination of CD24highCD29high was
suggested to identify the tumor initiation fraction in mouse
colon carcinomas (R.Fodde, personal communication,
[17]). Indeed, human colon CSCs were found to express
high levels of CD24 and CD29 [17], suggesting that these
markers can also identify human colon CSCs, although
further evidence is necessary.
Not only cell surface markers, but also activity of
certain pathways or enzymes can mark stemness. For

FUNCTION OF CSC MARKERS AND
THEIR RELEVANCE TO CSC BIOLOGY
Most of the markers used for colon CSC isolation
are chosen either because they are expressed in normal
stem cells or were found to identify CSCs in other
malignancies, either hematological or solid. The
disadvantage of choosing markers in this fashion is that
the functional effect of expression of the marker in CSCs
is usually unknown. Also, the expression level (high
versus low) used for identifying CSCs sometimes differs
between tissue types [37]. Therefore, the choice of these
markers is largely based on an “educated guess”.
For instance, breast cancer cells expressing either no
or low levels of single chain sialoglycoprotein CD24 in
combination with CD44-positivity have been identified
as CSCs [3], whereas in pancreas and colon, the CD24high
cells were shown to contain the tumor-initiating fraction
[10,17]. CD24, first described as a cell surface marker
for several haematopoietic cell populations, is known
to play a role in cell-cell interaction [38,39], adhesion
and proliferation [40,41]. Many cancers were found to
over-express CD24 [42-44], indicating that the protein
388

can play an important role in tumorigenesis. However,
its role in CSC biology remains undefined, especially
because the expression level by which the CSC should
be selected differs between tissue types. Together with
CD24, CD29-positivity has been used to identify the
colon CSC population [17]. Cell surface receptor CD29,
like CD24, mediates cell to extracellular matrix adhesion
and can promote cancer progression by inducing invasion,
migration and metastasis [45,46]. Its function in CSC
biology has not been studied yet.
The choice for CD166 as a marker for CSCs was
based on the heterogeneous expression of CD166 in
colon carcinoma in combination with the finding that
its expression correlates with a poor clinical outcome in
colorectal cancer (CRC) patients [47]. Also CD166 is
involved in regulation the formation of cell-cell contacts
[48,49]. Even though the function of the debated CSC
marker CD133 remains unknown, its presence in plasma
membrane protrusions [50,51] as well as its ability to
interact with plasma membrane cholesterol [52] suggests
that the protein might play a role in establishing and
maintaining plasmamembrane protrusions. This suggests
that CD133 could play a role in cell polarity and migration
[53] via cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. In contrast,
knockdown of CD133 in colon cancer cell lines or
primary colon cultures did not influence the proliferation,
migration, invasion, clonogenic and tumorigenic
formation capacity [19,54], indicating that the protein
itself is not required for maintenance of the CSC state.
Interestingly, most of the CSC markers were chosen
based on expression level instead of potential function in
CSCs and most of them seem to play a role in inducing and/
or maintaining cell-cell or cell-matrix contact. A worrying
aspect of such CSC markers is that enhanced attachment
could in part explain why cells expressing these markers
are more capable of growing in a new environment.
Xenograft growth is currently the accepted/compulsory
method to prove cancer stemness, but identification of
adherence factors as CSC markers could simply be a
reflection of the need for adherence in the assay itself.
For this reason, it would be favorable to identify CSCs by
markers that have a clear function in CSC biology.
CSC marker CD44 is one of those markers that might
have a more functional role in CSC biology. For instance,
knockdown of CD44 in primary colon cancer cell lines
reduces clonogenicity in vitro and tumorgenicity in vivo
[19]. CD44 is known to be involved in many cellular
processes like survival, growth, differentiation and
survival. As an important adhesion molecule, CD44 plays
a major role in cancer cell migration. Several different
splice variants are known for CD44. Interestingly, the
ectodomain of one of its variants, CD44v6, was found
to be required for c-Met activation in several tumors
[55,56]. Moreover, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), the
ligand for c-Met, can restore the CSC phenotype in more
differentiated colon cancer cells [22] and seems to play a
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

major role in maintaining a CSC state. Therefore, CD44
itself may have a role in regulating stemness in CSCs and
thus may be a functional cell surface CSC marker.
A more functional read-out of stemness in cancer
cells is the activity of the ALDH1 enzyme. This enzyme,
which oxidizes intracellular aldehydes, identifies the
cells that are more resistant to alkylating agents [57-59].
Therefore, cells that have high ALDH1 activity are better
protected against oxidative insults. In concordance, CSCs
are thought to be more resistant to therapeutic agents
[60-67]. In addition, ALDH1 convert retinol to retinoic
acid. The effect of retinoids on cells is very dependent
on the differentiation stage in which there are, but in
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), retinoids have been
shown to enhance self-renewal [56,68]. Therefore, high
ALDH1 activity can have a dual role in maintaining a
CSC state.
Another functional marker for CSCs, as recently
identified by our group, is Wnt activity. For normal
intestinal stem cells, Wnt activity is essential for
maintaining stemness and crypt survival [69,70].
Important players in the Wnt signaling cascade, the
tumor suppressor adenomatous polypolis coli (APC) and
ß-catenin, are frequently mutated in colon cancer. As a
consequence, ß-catenin will not be degraded by the APC
complex and accumulation of ß-catenin in the nucleus
and consequent activation of Wnt target genes occurs
[71]. However, despite the presence of these activating
mutations, tumors display heterogeneous expression
of nuclear ß-catenin [33,34], indicating that alternative
regulation of Wnt signaling is taking place. Cells with
high Wnt activity represent the CSCs within the tumor.
Importantly, extrinsic cues, like HGF produced by
surrounding myofibroblasts in the stroma, were shown to
modulate the Wnt signaling activity as well, providing a
connection between the stroma and the CSCs [22].
As described above, some functional markers have
been identified, but more will be needed. In addition,
the currently used cell surface markers should be more
investigated to discover their role in CSC biology.

WHY TARGET CSC?
Reliable markers that identify CSCs will pave the
way to better understanding of signaling pathways and
other regulatory mechanisms that determine stemness
and differentiation of CSCs. As CSCs are considered
to be the driving force behind tumor growth, therapies
will have to focus on strategies that include targeting of
CSCs. However, radio- or chemotherapy of cancer often
incompletely eradicates tumor cells [60-67] and this is
thought to be due to a selective survival advantage of
CSCs, which could explain relapse of the tumor after
many years. For example, studies have shown that
colon CSCs are more resistant to treatment with 5-FU or
oxaliplatin [16,72]. In addition, when CRC cell lines were
389

to gold-based nanomaterials [78,79]. Exposing CD133+
GBM cells to these anti-CD133-SWNTs induced
internalization of the SWNTs whereas CD133- cells did
not take up the SWNTs. Exposing the cells to 808-nm
near-infrared (NIR) laser light induced specific killing of
the CD133+ cells. In vivo treatment of CD133+-SWNTtreated GBM cells by NIR laser induced photothermolysis
also significantly reduced tumor growth [80].

treated with 5-FU or oxaliplatin in vitro, an increase in
CD133+CD44+ cells was observed [73], indicating that
the CSC fraction was enriched and thus resistant to these
therapeutics. Recurrence of colon cancer and appearance
of distant metastasis many years after initial treatment are
therefore hypothesized to be caused by residual CSCs. So,
by targeting the CSCs specifically, it should be possible
to obtain more complete degeneration of the tumor.
Obviously, combination therapies that target both CSCs
and more differentiated progeny will in the end be more
efficient for use in the clinic. Especially as new studies have
shown that factors produced by the microenvironment can
revert differentiated cells back to a more stem cell-like
state [22], indicating that killing the CSCs alone might not
be sufficient to diminish tumor growth.
From a more scientific perspective, killing CSCs
selectively in growing tumors could validate the currently
favored hypothesis that CSCs are the only clonogenic
cells within tumors. As indicated above, the current
xenotransplantation assays define the cells that are capable
of initiating tumor growth in immunocompromised mice.
However, it is currently unclear whether these cells are
also required to maintain growth of an existing tumor.
Therefore, ablating CSCs selectively in growing tumors
in vivo will give more insight into their biological role in
tumors as well as their flexibility/plasticity.

TARGETING DIFFERENTIATION AND
SURVIVAL SIGNALING IN CSC
Since conventional therapies do not suffice in killing
all tumor cells, the addition of a sensitizer targeting a
pathway responsible for resistance of CSCs or inducing
differentiation could overcome this problem. For instance,
colon carcinomas are producing IL-4 that is responsible
for upregulation anti-apoptotic molecules in these tumors.
Inhibiting IL-4 by blocking antibodies sensitizes the cells
for killing by 5-FU and oxaliplatin [16]. Also induction
of differentiation in colon CSCs by exposing these cells
to Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 (BMP4), which can
initiate a differentiation program as well as mediate
apoptosis [81], sensitizes colon cancer cells to killing with
5-FU or oxilaplatin in vivo, resulting in complete and long
term regression of colon xenografts [82].
Also other signaling pathways were found to
be involved in maintaining CSCs and therefore are
thought to be essential for tumor growth. For instance,
Hedgehog(HH) signaling is suggested to play a role in
CSCs of several tumor types, like glioblastoma [83] , breast
cancer [84], pancreatic cancer [85], multiple myeloma
[86] and colon cancer [87]. To activate HH signaling,
HH binds to the receptor Patched leading to the release of
Patched-mediated repression of Smoothened (SMO) and
to activation of the downstream Gli transcription factor
family. In CD133+ advanced/metastatic colon cancer
cells, higher levels of Gli1, a measure for HH activity,
were found, compared to CD133- cells. Inhibition of HH
signaling in primary colon cancer cell lines by knockdown
of SMO reduces proliferation and induces apoptosis in
vitro. In addition, in vivo tumor growth is abrogated by
inhibition of HH signaling, because of reduced survival
of CSCs [87].
Also Notch signaling has been identified as an
essential pathway for the maintenance of the stem-cell
like state of colon CSCs [88]. An important component
of the Notch pathway is delta-like 4 ligand (DLL4).
By inhibiting DLL4 with human monoclonal antibody
21M18 in colon carcinoma xenografts, the tumor growth
as well as the CSC frequency, measured by the amount
of ESA+CD44+CD166+ cells is decreased compared
to control. Interestingly, even though treatment of the
xenografts with irinotecan, a chemotherapeutic often used
in colon cancer, slowed down tumor growth, the frequency
of ESA+CD44+CD166+ cells and the clonogenicity was

TARGETING CSC MARKERS
A strategy to target CSCs is exploiting the presence
of their cell surface markers. Membrane proteins can be
targeted directly or used to internalize a death-inducing
compound. For instance, in AML blasts, the first strategy
was employed. One of the problems in AML is that blast
cells are arrested in more progenitor-like state and do not
fully differentiate. The CSC marker CD44 is known to
play a role in normal myeloid differentiation, as this can be
inhibited by CD44 blocking antibodies [74,75]. Treatment
of AML blasts in vitro with CD44-activating monoclonal
antibodies relieves the differentiation blockade. Moreover,
in some cases, the CD44-activating antibodies could
decrease proliferation and increase apoptosis of the blasts
[76]. Additionally, leukemic stem cells (LSCs) could be
killed in vivo when mice transplanted with AML cells
were treated with the activating CD44 antibody H90.
Ligation of CD44 inhibited the migration of LSCs to
their niche, but also affected LSCs intrinsically, because
repopulation capacity was severally affected afterwards
[16,77]. Combined, this suggests that targeting CD44
could be a good strategy to attack CSCs.
The use of cell surface markers to guide toxic insults
was employed by Wang et al. who targeted the CSC
marker CD133 in glioblastoma (GBM). They conjugated
an anti-CD133 antibody to single walled carbon nanotubes
(SWNTs), which were developed to serve as an alternative
option for localized hyperthermia treatment in comparison

increased. Combination treatment of irinotecan with
anti-hDLL4 reduced again the tumor growth and stem
cell frequency, at even higher levels than the anti-DLL4
treatment alone [89]. This indicates that inhibiting Notch
signaling reduces CSC frequencies and sensitizes tumor
cells for irinotecan treatment.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
Several markers have been used to identify colon
CSCs, such as CD24, CD29, CD133, CD166, but the
function of these proteins in CSC biology has not yet
been clarified. Interestingly, these CSCs markers are
involved in cellular adherence and since the golden
standard in this field to identify CSCs by their capacity
to recapitulate the original tumor when xenotransplanted
into immunocompromised mice, the presence of
adherence markers can be exploited by these cells to
form new tumors. Therefore, the role of CSCs markers
in maintaining a stem cell state should be investigated
and more functionally important markers should be
identified, like CD44, ALDH1 activity and Wnt signaling.
Combination of previously known and new markers could
lead to more directed therapy that specifically targets
CSCs. At therapeutic and scientific level, specific targeting
of CSCs could give more insight into how and whether
these CSCs maintain tumor growth and in which way
we can eradicate them. Studies that target CSCs within
a growing tumor by suicide gene therapy could give not
only more insight into their ability to maintain tumor
growth, but also into their flexibility/plasticity within a
tumor. This is especially relevant as an increasing number
of studies indicate a role for the microenvironment/niche
in the maintenance CSCs, which could even be dominant.
Although this role is currently ill-defined it could provide
novel clues for CSC biology as well as therapy.

THERAPY
FOR
AS PROOF OF

As mentioned above, many studies support the
existence of CSCs. However, sorting techniques to isolate
CSCs, as well as xenotransplantation assays needed to
prove stemness, also disrupt the tumor microenvironment
and likely introduce a selection bias. Therefore, it is
difficult to prove that CSCs unequivocally exist. To study
the actual role of CSCs in tumor growth in vivo, gene
suicide therapy specifically against CSCs are needed.
Using this strategy, suicide genes like the herpex simplex
virys thymidine kinase (TK), diphtheria toxin or proapoptotic genes are placed under the regulation of a CSCspecific promoter. The activity of the suicide genes is then
regulated either by a prodrug such as ganciclovir for TK
or by combination with a genetic control mechanism, for
instance using a stop cassette flanked by loxP sites so that
suicide gene expression can be induced upon removal of
the floxed cassette. CSCs can then be specifically targeted
and the effect on tumor growth can be studied.
A method to target CSCs by a suicide gene that is
independent of cell division is making use of Diphtheria
Toxin A (DTA) gene. The DTA gene encodes for an
adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribosyltransferase which is
responsible for ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor 2.
The effect of this ribosylation is that protein synthesis is
inhibited and cell death is induced [90]. The advantage
of this system is that only one molecule of DTA per cell
is sufficient to induce cell death [91]. A recent study was
published that made use of expressing DTA under a CSC
marker. In this study, mouse glioma-initiating cells (GICs)
were generated by overexpressing SV40 Large T antigen
and oncogenic Ras in neural mouse stem cells. To be able
to specifically eradicate GICs, these cells were genetically
modified to carry the DTA gene by a floxed-lacZ cassette
under the control of the CD133 locus as well as a CreER
construct under the expression of a ubiquitous promoter.
Injection of these GICs resulted in tumor formation that
matched human glioma phenotypically. In addition, the
tumors displayed a subset of cells that were CD133+.
When the GICs were ablated from CD133+ cells by
addition of tamoxifen in vitro and subsequently injected
in vivo, the tumor formation was not affected, showing
that CD133+ cells are not required for tumorigenesis in
this model [92]. Whether this is also the case for colon
cancer growth remains to be established. However, these
findings could significantly change the CSC dogma and
