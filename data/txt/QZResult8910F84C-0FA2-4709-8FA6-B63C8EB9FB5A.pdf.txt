ABSTRACT
This study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the resistance of breast
cancer to eribulin. Seven eribulin-resistant breast cancer cell lines (MCF7/E, BT474/E,
ZR75-1/E, SKBR3/E, MDA-MB-231/E, Hs578T/E, and MDA-MB-157/E) were established.
mRNA and protein expression of ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1)
and subfamily C member 11 (ABCC11) increased in all eribulin-resistant cell lines
compared to the parental cell lines. When ABCB1 or ABCC11 expression was inhibited by
small interfering RNA in MCF7/E, BT474/E, and MDA-MB-231/E cells, eribulin sensitivity
was partially restored. Moreover, eribulin resistance was attenuated additively by
inhibiting ABCB1 and ABCC11 in MCF7/E cells. Additionally, overexpression of exogenous
ABCB1 or ABCC11 in HEK293T cells conferred resistance to eribulin. MCF7/E and MDAMB-231/E cells showed cross-resistance to paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil.
Inhibition of ABCB1 partially restored paclitaxel and doxorubicin sensitivity. Partial
restoration of fluorouracil sensitivity was induced by inhibiting ABCC11 in MCF7/E
and MDA-MB-231/E cells. Both ABCB1 and ABCC11 are involved in the development of
eribulin resistance in breast cancer cells in vitro regardless of the breast cancer subtype.
Thus, ABCB1 and ABCC11 expression may be used as a biomarker for predicting the
response to eribulin in patients with breast cancer. Concomitant inhibition of ABCB1
and ABCC11 might help enhance the antitumor effects of eribulin.

mechanisms underlying this resistance to eribulin have not
been fully elucidated.
ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are primary
active transporters that confer drug resistance by effluxing
anticancer agents [4]. ABC transporters consist of 48
members that are classified into seven subfamilies from
ABCA to ABCG based on their sequence similarity [5].
Among them, ABC subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1)/Pglycoprotein (MDR1) has been implicated as the major
efflux transporter responsible for the resistance of cancer
cells to many anticancer agents such as cisplatin, docetaxel,
anthracyclines (doxorubicin, epirubicin), etoposide,
irinotecan, methotrexate, paclitaxel, and vincristine [5, 6].
Members of the ABC subfamily C/multidrug resistance
protein (ABCC/MRP) superfamily consist of 13 subfamily
members (ABCC1 to ABCC13). Among the ABCC
subfamily members, ABCC1 (MRP1) and ABCC2 (MRP2)

INTRODUCTION
Eribulin mesylate (eribulin) is a synthetic macrocyclic
ketone analog of the marine sponge natural product
halichondrin B and is an inhibitor of microtubule dynamics
[1, 2]. Eribulin inhibits microtubule polymerization by a
mechanism distinct from those of other antitubulin agents
such as vinblastine or taxanes. When administered to
patients with metastatic breast cancer who had previously
received both an anthracyclin and a taxane in either
the adjuvant or metastatic setting, eribulin significantly
increased their overall survival by monotherapy; thus,
eribulin is currently an approved treatment for patients with
advanced breast cancer [3]. However, most patients fail to
respond to eribulin within several months, a phenomenon
that has also been observed for many other cytotoxic drugs
that were previously administered for breast cancer, and the

of chemotherapeutic agents; they also confer resistance
to various anticancer agents including anthracyclines,
etoposide, methotrexate, mitoxantrone, and cisplatin [5,
7–13], whereas ABCC11 confers resistance to fluorouracil,
methotrexate, and pemetrexed [14–21]. However, the
involvement of ABC transporters in the resistance of cancer
cells to eribulin has not yet been reported.
To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the
development of eribulin resistance in breast cancer cells,
we established several eribulin-resistant cell lines using
different breast cancer cell subtypes. In the present study,
we demonstrated for the first time that ABCB1 and
ABCC11 confer eribulin resistance in breast cancer cells
regardless of their subtype.

6 months. The eribulin-resistant cell lines were designated
as MCF7/E, BT474/E, ZR75-1/E, SKBR3/E, MDA-MB231/E, Hs578T/E, and MDA-MB-157/E, respectively. The
relative eribulin resistance of each eribulin-resistant cell
line compared to the corresponding parental cell line was
determined using a WST assay (Figure 1). Although an
eribulin-resistant cell line was established for each breast
cancer cell line, the IC50 for the eribulin-resistant cell lines
varied among the cell lines. The IC50 for the parental cell
lines ranged from 0.1 to 1.3 nM, whereas the IC50 for the
eribulin-resistant cell lines ranged from 4.7 to 556.7 nM.
The eribulin resistance of the eribulin-resistant cell lines was
7.9-fold to 672.1-fold greater than that of the parental cell
lines. The MCF7/E cell line showed the highest IC50 (556.7
± 108.4 nM), whereas the SKBR3/E cell line showed the
lowest IC50 (4.7 ± 0.4 nM).
The expression of estrogen receptor α (ERα) and
human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) in
each parental cell line was evaluated by western blotting.
Expression of ERα was detected in MCF7, BT474, and
ZR75-1 cells. Expression of HER-2 was detected in
BT474 and SKBR3 cells (Supplementary Figure 1).
The characteristics of the parental cell lines and IC50 for
eribulin in the parental and eribulin-resistant cell lines are
summarized in Table 1.

Increased expression of ABCB1 and ABCC11 in
eribulin-resistant breast cancer cell lines

that were detected by western blot analyses were similar
to the expression increases observed in the real-time RTPCR analyses. Hence, upregulation of both ABCB1 and
ABCC11 in breast cancer cells was induced by continuous
treatment regardless of the subtype of the cells.

Prior to the present study, we compared the gene
expression profile between MCF7 and MCF7/E cells
by microarray analysis. The expression of ABCB1 and
ABCC11 in MCF7/E cells increased 56.1-fold and 19.7fold, respectively, compared to that in the parental MCF7
cells (data not shown). Based on this result, we examined
the expression of ABCB1 and ABCC11 in seven breast
cancer cell lines and their eribulin-resistant cells by realtime RT-PCR and western blotting. Figure 2A and 2B
show the ABCB1 mRNA expression levels quantitated
by real-time RT-PCR and the representative western blots
of ABCB1, respectively, for the parental and eribulinresistant cell lines. Although the expression levels varied
from cell line to cell line, ABCB1 mRNA expression was
significantly increased in all eribulin-resistant cell lines
compared to the expression in the corresponding parental
cell lines. In BT474/E, ZR75-1/E, and MDMB-157/E
cells, a significant increase in ABCB1 expression was
observed in both the real-time RT-PCR and western blot
analyses, whereas the increased ABCB1 expression that
was detected by real-time RT-PCR did not correspond to
the results of the western blot analyses in the MCF7/E and
SKBR3/E cells.
Figure 2C and 2D show the ABCC11 mRNA
expression levels quantitated by real-time RT-PCR and
representative western blots of ABCC11, respectively,
for the parental and eribulin-resistant cell lines. Realtime RT-PCR revealed that expression of ABCC11 was
significantly increased in all eribulin-resistant cell lines
compared to the expression in the corresponding parental
cell lines; moreover, the increases in ABCC11 expression

Restoration of eribulin sensitivity by ABCB1 or
ABCC11 knockdown in eribulin-resistant breast
cancer cells
To further examine the involvement of ABCB1
and ABCC11 in the development of eribulin resistance
in breast cancer cells, we tested whether knockdown of
ABCB1 or ABCC11 would restore eribulin sensitivity
in eribulin-resistant breast cancer cells. We chose three
eribulin-resistant cell lines (MCF7/E, BT474/E, and
MDA-MB-231/E) for the experiment. Inhibition of
ABCB1 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA)
was confirmed at both the mRNA and protein levels for
the three cell lines (Figure 3A). Eribulin sensitivity was
partially restored in MCF7/E and BT474/E cells, whereas
siRNA targeting of ABCB1 resensitized the MDA-MB231/E cells to eribulin to the same IC50 level as the parental
MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 3B).
Inhibition of ABCC11 expression by siRNA was
confirmed at both the mRNA and protein levels in the three
cell lines (Figure 3C). Eribulin sensitivity was partially
restored in the three selected eribulin-resistant cell lines.
The restoration effect was more potent in MCF7/E cells
than in the other cells (Figure 3D). The growth inhibitory
effects induced by eribulin in the eribulin-resistant cell
lines in these experiments were of lower magnitude than
the effects demonstrated in Figure 1, and this discrepancies
was considered to result from the shorter incubation times

in the siRNA experiments compared with the experiments
used to determine the IC50 for each cell line.
Next, to evaluate whether the sensitivity to eribulin
was restored additively by inhibiting expression of both
ABCB1 and ABCC11 in the eribulin-resistant MCF7/E
cells, knockdown of both ABCB1 and ABCC11 was
performed in the MCF7/E cells. When the MCF7/E cells
were transfected with siRNA that targeted ABCB1 and
siRNA that targeted ABCC11, the expression of both
ABCB1 and ABCC11 was inhibited to the same extent as
when the cells were transfected with either siRNA alone.
Expression of ABCB1 was not inhibited by transfection
with the ABCC11-targeting siRNA, and expression of
ABCC11 was not inhibited by transfection with the
ABCB1-targeting siRNA (Figure 3E). Inhibition of both
ABCB1 and ABCC11 expression in the MCF7/E cells
restored eribulin sensitivity to approximately the level
observed for the parental MCF7 cells (Figure 3F). These
results demonstrate that inhibiting the expression of either
ABCB1 or ABCC11 restored the sensitivity to eribulin,
although the degree of restoration varied depending on
the cell line, indicating that ABCB1 and ABCC11 are
involved in the development of eribulin resistance in these
breast cancer cells.

with the empty vector. Thus, exogenous overexpression
of both ABCB1 and ABCC11 was able to confer resistance
to eribulin in HEK293T cells, although the degree of
resistance induced by ABCB1 was more remarkable than
that induced by ABCC11 (Figure 4B).
Furthermore, HEK293T cells that were
transfected with ABCB1 became resistant to paclitaxel
and doxorubicin, whereas HEK293T cells that were
transfected with ABCC11 became resistant to fluorouracil
(Figure 4C–4E). However, transfection of HEK293T cells
with ABCC11 did not confer resistance to either paclitaxel
or doxorubicin, whereas transfection of HEK293T cells
with ABCB1 did not alter their sensitivity to fluorouracil
(Figure 4C–4E).

Cross-resistance to paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and
fluorouracil in eribulin-resistant breast cancer
cells
ABCB1 is known to confer resistance to a variety
of anticancer agents including paclitaxel and doxorubicin
[5]. ABCC11 is associated with resistance to fluorouracil
[18]. In our experiments, overexpression of ABCB1
conferred resistance to doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and
eribulin in HEK293T cells, whereas overexpression of
ABCC11 conferred resistance to both fluorouracil and
eribulin. Given these findings, we examined whether
MCF7/E and MDA-MB231/E breast cancer cells would
demonstrate cross-resistance to paclitaxel, doxorubicin,
and fluorouracil. As demonstrated in Figure 5A, both
MCF7/E and MDA-MB-231/E cells showed higher IC50
for paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil compared
to their parental cell lines, indicating that both cell lines
acquired cross-resistance to these three drugs in the course
of developing resistance to eribulin (Figure 5 and Table 2).

Overexpression of either ABCB1 or ABCC11
confers resistance to eribulin in SV40transformed human embryonic kidney
(HEK293T) cells
To confirm that both ABCB1 and ABCC11 were
able to confer resistance to eribulin in breast cancer
cells, we tested whether transient overexpression of
ABCB1 or ABCC11 would alter the sensitivity to
eribulin in HEK293T cells. A plasmid containing FlagABCB1 or Flag-ABCC11 was introduced into HEK293T
cells. HEK293T cells transfected with an empty vector
(pcDNA3.1) were used as a control. In the HEK293T cells
transfected with the empty vector, no ABCB1 expression
was detected in western blots, whereas weak expression
of ABCC11 was detected. Thus, neither ABCB1 nor
ABCC11 was expressed at a high level in HEK293T cells.
In contrast, high expression of ABCB1 and ABCC11 was
detected in HEK293T cells that were transfected with the
vectors expressing ABCB1 or ABCC11. The production
of ABCB1 and ABCC11 by exogenously introduced
genes was confirmed by immunoblots with an anti-FLAG
antibody (Figure 4A).
In the HEK293T cells that were transfected with an
empty vector, the IC50 for eribulin was 2.8 nM, whereas in
the HEK293T cells that were transfected with ABCB1, the
IC50 for eribulin was 833.3 nM, indicated a 297.6-fold in
resistance compared to the cells transfected with the empty
vector. In the cells that were transfected with ABCC11, the
IC50 for eribulin was 9.1 nM, which indicated a 3.3-fold
increase in resistance compared to the cells transfected

Inhibition of ABCB1 or ABCC11 alters the
cross-resistance to paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and
fluorouracil in eribulin-resistant breast cancer
cells
To further investigate the involvement of ABCB1
and ABCC11 in the observed cross-resistance to paclitaxel,
doxorubicin, and fluorouracil in MCF7/E and MDA-MB231/E cells, we inhibited ABCB1 or ABCC11 expression
with siRNA in these cells and evaluated the sensitivity to
paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (Figure 6). Both
the mRNA and protein expression of ABCB1 and ABCC11
was decreased at 24 h after transfection with siRNA that
targeted ABCB1 or ABCC11, respectively (Supplementary
Figure 2). Inhibition of ABCB1 expression partially
restored the sensitivity to paclitaxel and doxorubicin in
both MCF7/E and MDA-MB-231/E cells (Figure 6A
and 6B). Inhibition of ABCB1 expression did not alter
the sensitivity to fluorouracil in either cell type (Figure
6C). In contrast, partial restoration of the sensitivity to

DISCUSSION

fluorouracil was on inhibition of ABCC11 expression in
MCF7/E and MDA-MB231/E cells, whereas inhibition of
ABCC11 expression did not alter the sensitivity of either
cell type to paclitaxel and doxorubicin (Figure 6D–6F).
These results indicate that the cross-resistance to paclitaxel
and doxorubicin that was observed in the MCF7/E and
MDA-MB-231/E cells was mainly derived from ABCB1,
whereas the cross-resistance to fluorouracil was mainly
derived from ABCC11.

Thus far, the mechanisms underlying resistance to
eribulin have remained unknown. In the present study, we
demonstrated that the expression of two ABC transporters,
ABCB1 and ABCC11, which belong to different ABC
transporter subfamilies, was increased in eribulin-resistant
breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, overexpression of
ABCB1 and ABCC11 conferred resistance to eribulin
independently in HEK293T cells. To the best of our
70022

Oncotarget

knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate the
involvement of ABCC11 in the development of eribulin
resistance in cancer cells. Although Laughney et al. [22]
also reported an association between ABCB1 and eribulin
resistance, our study is the first to show that resistance
to eribulin can be directly induced by transfecting cells
with the ABCB1 gene in vitro. Our data suggest that both
ABCB1 and ABCC11 are involved in the development of
eribulin resistance in breast cancer cells and that eribulin
or its metabolites might be substrates of ABCB1 and
ABCC11.
ABC transporters play biologically important roles
as membrane transporters [4]. In addition to their many
physiological functions in the normal cells of various
organs, some transporters have been known to induce
resistance to anticancer agents by effluxing the agents
themselves or their metabolites from cancer cells [23].
ABCB1 was identified in 1976 by Juliano and Ling
[24] as a membrane glycoprotein that is overexpressed
in colchicine-resistant cell lines and reduces drug
permeability. ABCB1 has a wide substrate spectrum and
can therefore mediate the export of a variety of drugs
from different drug classes. These substrates include
chemotherapeutic drugs such as anthracyclines, taxanes,
and vinca alkaloids [6, 25–30].
In contrast, the classification of the ABCC
subfamily originated from the finding of multidrug
resistance protein-1 (MRP1) as the second major ABC
drug transporter by Cole et al. in 1992 [13]. Three
research groups cloned ABCC11, a member of the
ABCC subfamily, independently in 2001 [15, 16, 20].
Subsequent studies demonstrated that a nonsynonymous
single nucleotide polymorphism (538G>A) in the ABCC11
gene determines the type of human earwax and axillary
osmidrosis [31–33]. Additionally, it has been reported
that human ABCC11 functions as an ATP-dependent
efflux pump for amphipathic anions, including cyclic
nucleotides, leukotriene C4, estrone 3-sulfate, estradiol
17-beta-D-glucuronide, and anti-viral agents [14, 19,
21, 34, 35]. Guo et al. [14] demonstrated that pig kidney
epithelial cells transfected with wild-type ABCC11
exhibited increased resistance to fluorouracil, whereas
increased resistance was not detected for vincristine,
paclitaxel, doxorubicin, or etoposide. In lung cancer cell
lines, ABCC11 has been reported to confer resistance to
fluorouracil, methotrexate, and pemetrexed [14–21].
In our study, resistance to fluorouracil was induced
by overexpression ABCC11 in HEK293T cells, whereas
the sensitivity to paclitaxel or doxorubicin was not altered.
Moreover, the sensitivity to fluorouracil was enhanced by
inhibition of ABCC11 expression with siRNA in MCF7/E
cells that demonstrated increased ABCC11 expression
and cross-resistance to fluorouracil. Thus, our findings,
together with the results of previous studies, demonstrate
that ABCC11 is involved in the alteration of fluorouracil
sensitivity in cancer cells. However, no previous studies
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

reported an association between ABCC11 and resistance
to eribulin. In the present study, increased ABCC11
expression was detected in all of the eribulin-resistant
clones established by exposing seven different breast
cancer cell lines to eribulin. In addition, exogenous
expression of ABCC11 decreased the sensitivity to
eribulin in HEK293T cells. Thus, it is clear that ABCC11
is involved in altering eribulin sensitivity in cancer
cells. Although many molecules are likely involved in
the development of eribulin resistance in clinical breast
cancers, our report is the first to concretely reveal some of
the mechanisms underlying eribulin resistance.
A meta-analysis of 31 studies previously
demonstrated that ABCB1 (MDR1/P-glycoprotein)
expression in tumors is associated with a poor response
to chemotherapy [9–36]. Although the strategy to
interfere with the transport activity of ABCB1 (MDR1/
P-glycoprotein) has not been applied successfully in a
clinical setting, accumulated data obtained from both in
vitro and clinical samples indicate that ABCB1 (MDR1/
P-glycoprotein) serves an important role in determining
phenotype, including the susceptibility of breast cancer
cells to anticancer agents [5, 6, 29, 36–38]. Ota et al.
[39] reported an association between a single nucleotide
polymorphism (538G>A) in ABCC11 and the risk of
breast cancer in Japanese women. In addition, Yamada
et al. [40] recently reported that ABCC11 was expressed
significantly more frequently in aggressive subtypes
and was associated with a poor prognosis in patients
with breast cancer. These findings indicate a certain
role of ABCC11 in the development and progression of
breast cancer. It is intriguing that the expression of two
ABC transporters with different substrate specificity
was increased simultaneously by long-term exposure to
eribulin in seven breast cancer cell lines, regardless of the
receptor status of the cell lines. Eribulin binds to the vinca
domain of tubulin; however, its antimitotic mechanism is
distinct from that of other microtubule inhibitors such as
vinca alkaloids and taxanes. Although the mechanisms
underlying the transcriptional regulation of ABCC11 have
not been elucidated, a common transcriptional regulatory
mechanism might exist for up-regulation of the ABCB1
and ABCC11 genes induced by eribulin-mediated stress.
The biology of breast cancer is known to depend
largely on its subtype, which is determined mainly by
the receptor status, and it is globally accepted that the
therapeutic strategy is based on the subtype [41]. In
the present study, upregulation of both ABCB1 and
ABCC11 was observed in all seven breast cancer cell
lines, regardless of their receptor status. These findings
highlight the universal involvement of these transporters
in the development of eribulin resistance in breast cancer
cells. However, the degree to which ABCC11 contributed
to eribulin resistance was much higher in MCF7 cells,
which are positive for ERα, than in the triple-negative
breast cancer cell lines. Thus, the degree to which each
70023

transporter contributes to eribulin resistance may vary
among breast cancer subtypes. Honorat et al. [42] reported
a positive correlation between ABCC11 and ERα in breast
cancer cell lines and clinical specimens, and indicated
a possible contribution of ABCC11 to the sensitivity to
chemotherapeutic agents including fluorouracil in ERαpositive breast cancer that is resistant to tamoxifen. In the
present study, the increased ABCC11 expression induced
by the long-term exposure to eribulin conferred resistance
to fluorouracil in ER-positive MCF7 cells. Therefore,
our data strongly support that ABCC11 is involved in
the development of fluorouracil resistance in ER-positive
breast cancer cells.
Recently, Shi et al. demonstrated that ERα activates
ABCB1 transcription and increases paclitaxel resistance
in ERα-positive breast cancer cells [43]. Their report
together with the study of Honorat et al. described above
suggests that ERα is involved in the regulation of both
ABCB1 and ABCC11 expression in ERα-positive breast
cancer cells, although these transporters were upregulated
in breast cancer cells regardless of the expression of
ERα in the present study. Therefore, further studies are
required to elucidate the transcriptional regulation of these
transporters in both ERα-positive and ERα-negative breast
cancer cells.
Many anticancer agents have been applied in the
treatment of breast cancer, and the prognoses of patients
with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer have improved
[44]. However, multidrug resistance induced by previously
administered anticancer agents is frequently encountered
in clinical practice and often limits the efficacy of
subsequent anticancer agents. In the present study,
both MCF7/E and MDA-MB231/E cells showed crossresistance to three key drugs that are used to treat breast
cancer, namely doxorubin, paclitaxel, and fluorouracil.
Furthermore, the involvement of ABCB1 and ABCC11 in
the cross-resistance was confirmed by siRNA-mediated
knockdown. Although further examination is necessary to
determine whether or not eribulin increases ABCB1 and
ABCC11 expression in clinically treated breast cancer,
the induction of resistance to key breast cancer treatment
drugs should be taken into consideration when designing a
treatment strategy for patients with recurrent breast cancer.
In conclusion, our study demonstrated that both
ABCB1 and ABCC11 were able to confer resistance to
eribulin; we also showed that increased expression of both
ABCB1 and ABCC11 may be involved in the development
of eribulin resistance in breast cancer cells, regardless of
the subtype. Our results suggest that ABCB1 and ABCC11
may be used as biomarkers for predicting the response
to eribulin in patients with breast cancer. Moreover, a
novel therapeutic strategy for enhancing or prolonging
the therapeutic effects of eribulin might be established by
revealing the precise mechanisms underlying the induction
of these transporters or by designing a specific inhibitor
for them.

Cell culture and agents
Seven breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, BT474,
ZR75-1, SKBR3, MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, and MDAMB-157) were purchased from the American Type Cell
Collection (Manassas, VA) at the beginning of the study.
HEK293T cells were kindly donated by Dr. Takeshita
Toshikazu at Shinshu University. All cell lines were
cultured in RPMI with 10% FBS at 37.0°C under 5%
CO2. Eribulin-resistant cell lines were established in our
laboratory by continuous exposure to stepwise increases
in the concentration of eribulin for more than 6 months,
during which time the medium was replaced every 3 days
and the cultured cells were subcultured by trypsinization
when they reached 70% confluency. Through this process,
we selected several eribulin-resistant clones for each
breast cancer cell line, and then used one representative
clone in the subsequent experiments. The established
eribulin-resistant clones were maintained in the eribulincontaining media throughout the experiments.
Eribulin was purchased from Eisai Co., Ltd. (Tokyo,
Japan). Paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO).

WST assay
The growth inhibitory effects of eribulin, paclitaxel,
doxorubicin, and fluorouracil were measured using a
tetrazolium salt-based proliferation assay (WST assay;
Wako Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 4 × 103 cells were
cultured in 96-well plates in 100 μL of growth medium
and incubated for 24 h. Then, 100 μL of medium with a
graded concentration of eribulin, paclitaxel, doxorubicin,
or fluorouracil was added into each well and cultured
for 96 h in the experiment determining the IC50 for the
eribulin-resistant cells or 72 h in the experiments involving
transfection with siRNA or plasmid DNA. Then, 10 μL of
WST-8 solution was added to each well, and the plates
were incubated at 37°C for another 3 h. The absorbance
was measured at 450 and 640 nm using SoftMax Pro
(Molecular Devices, Tokyo, Japan), and the cell viability
was determined. Each experiment was independently
performed and repeated at least three times.

Total RNA extraction and quantitative real-time
RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Mini kit
(Qiagen, Alameda, CA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. TaqMan Gene Expression Assays for ABCB1
(#Hs00184500_m1), ABCC11 (#Hs01090768_m1), and
β-actin (#Hs99999903_m1) were purchased from Applied
Biosystems (Carlsbad, CA) and mRNA levels were

Switzerland) following the manufacturer’s protocol. An
empty vector was included as a control in all experiments.
Twenty-four hours after transfection, proteins were
extracted and 5 × 103 cells/well were cultured in 96-well
tissue culture plates and incubated for 72 h after addition
of stepwise dilutions of eribulin, paclitaxel, doxorubicin,
or fluorouracil. Finally, the absorbance was measured by
using the WST solution as described above.

Microarray analysis
Total RNA from parental MCF7 cells and
MCF7/E cells was extracted using an RNeasy Mini kit
(Qiagen, Alameda, CA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Microarray analysis using an Agilent
SurePrint G3 Human GE v2 8x60K Microarray (Design
ID: 039494) was performed at DNA Chip Research Inc.
(Tokyo, Japan).

Statistical analysis
The levels of mRNA expression obtained by realtime RT-PCR were examined by Student’s t-tests; P<0.05
was considered statistically significant (StatFlex ver.6,
Artech Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan).

Western blotting
Proteins were isolated from cells as previously
described and used in western blot analyses (10 μg/
lane) [36–37]. The membrane was probed with the
following antibodies: anti-ERα antibody (1:200; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, CA), anti-HER2
antibody(1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers,
MA), anti-ABCB1 antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling
Technology, Danvers, MA), anti-ABCC11 antibody
(1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, CA),
and anti-FLAG antibody (1:500; Sigma, Saint Louis,
MO). β-actin (1:5000; Sigma, Saint Louis, MO) was
used as a loading control. Each experiment was repeated
independently at least three times and one representative
blot was chosen for the figures.
