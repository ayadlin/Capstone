BACKGROUND: This prospective study evaluated patient and treatment characteristics that contributed to
hematologic toxicity in older breast cancer patients treated with curative intent in the community setting.
METHODS: Data were collected on 1224 patients with stage I through III breast cancer, of whom 207 were
aged 65 years (grading determined according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system). Primary outcome measures included anemia, thrombocytopenia, severe neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and both planned and actual relative dose intensity (RDI). Comparisons between older and younger
patients regarding hematologic toxicity and reductions in RDI were based on univariate and multivariate
logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The neutropenic complication rate in older patients (45.1%) was not
significantly different from that in the younger patients (43.7%). There were also no significant differences
in rates of anemia or thrombocytopenia. Approximately 34.0% of the older patients received RDI <85%
compared with 20.0% among younger patients (P < .01). Fewer older patients received anthracyclinebased chemotherapy (64.3% compared with 83.8% in younger patients, P < .01). Fewer older patients
received prophylactic white blood cell colony-stimulating factor (18.4%) compared with younger patients
(28.0%) (P < .01). Conclusions: There were no significant differences noted with regard to chemotherapyrelated hematologic toxicities between older and younger breast cancer patients in this large prospective
observational study. This may be explained, in part, by more frequent reductions in RDI and less frequent

Breast cancer incidence in the United States rises significantly with increasing age. Approximately half
of the women diagnosed with the disease are aged 65 years.1 Benefits from chemotherapy in terms of disease-free and overall survival for women aged 50 to 69 years are substantial, although not as great as those
seen in women aged <50 years.2 The benefits from chemotherapy for women aged >65 years have been

confirmed, albeit at a price of higher treatment-related
mortality compared with younger patients.3 Chemotherapy-associated toxicities have also been shown to
increase with age.4 One approach to decreasing chemotherapy-related toxicities has been to reduce the relative
dose intensity (RDI) of chemotherapy delivered to
patients. With evidence that a threshold of chemotherapy
RDI exists below which clinical benefit is substantially
undermined,5-8 dose reductions, particularly in the curative setting, should be viewed as a strategy of last resort.
Nevertheless, this practice persists,9,10 particularly with
older patients.11 Concerns regarding higher risk to benefit
ratios for chemotherapy use in older patients have, in part,
fueled the comparative underrepresentation of older
patients in clinical trials.12 Likewise, in general practice,
despite the National Institutes of Health consensus recommendations,13 chemotherapy use for the management
of breast cancer has been shown to decrease with increasing age.14-16 Accordingly, some uncertainty regarding the
value of chemotherapy for older women with high-risk
breast cancer persists. Determination of the value of
chemotherapy is based, in part, on quantifying toxicity
rates and extent as well as benefits in a representative population. Understanding the value of chemotherapy for
this age group may be compromised by selection bias inherent in clinical trials, which comprise the major source
of data on this subject.2,3,17 Those deemed eligible to participate in clinical trials may not necessarily be representative of the population of older patients at large, who in
general tend to have more comorbidities and take more
medications than their younger counterparts. More recent
studies assessing trends in chemotherapy use for older
breast cancer patients in nonclinical trial registries have
not included dose intensity and its potential impact on
toxicity in the analysis.14-17 This study was performed to
determine the interaction of dose intensity and hematologic toxicity prospectively in older nonrandomized breast
cancer patients in a community oncology practice setting.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Characteristics
A prospective observational study of 115 randomly
selected US community oncology practices was undertaken containing a total of 4458 cancer patients starting
5320

a new chemotherapy regimen enrolled between March
2002 and October 2005. The study included 1224 consecutive eligible breast cancer patients with nonmetastatic
disease. Sites were selected for participation in this
patient registry through stratified random sampling
incorporating practice size and geographic location. All
practice sites were institution review board-approved,
and all patients signed informed consent. Anonymous
numeric codes were used to ensure patient confidentiality. Patients were enrolled before initiation of at least 4
cycles of chemotherapy. Data were gathered on each
patient, including pretreatment patient characteristics
such as age, number of comorbidities, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG
PS). Comorbidity assessments on each patient were
made using the Charlson Comorbidity Index.18 For the
analysis, only the unweighted number of comorbidities,
as in 0, 1, or 2, and not disease severity was determined. Body surface area was calculated using the Mosteller formula19 incorporating the patient’s actual height
and weight. Data pertaining to treatment included type
of chemotherapy regimen, treatment schedule, and both
planned and actual doses for each drug.

Clinical Outcomes
Primary outcome measures included incidence of grade 2
or higher anemia (hemoglobin <10 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (platelets <75  1000/mm3), severe neutropenia
(SN; defined as neutrophils <500 cells/mm3 or white
blood cell count <1000/mm3), febrile neutropenia (FN;
neutrophils <1000 cells/mm3 and documented fever/
infection), and both planned and actual RDI compared
with standard chemotherapy regimens. The definition of
standard dose intensity for each drug was the established
dose in milligrams per square meter per unit time (week).
A comprehensive literature review of articles and reference
manuals on chemotherapy was performed to identify the
standard or established dose intensity.20-28 Oncology
experts were consulted when >1 possible chemotherapy
schedule or dose was identified, to provide an opinion on
which of the possible schedules or doses should be considered ‘‘standard.’’ To avoid overestimation of standards in
the event that >1 potential standard regimen was identified, the more conservative schedule or dosing pattern
was selected. The definition of RDI was accounted for by

the ratio of either the actual or the planned dose intensity
relative to the standard dose intensity. Reductions in
RDI, both planned and unplanned, were calculated for
each chemotherapeutic agent and averaged for each regimen. RDI for each chemotherapy regimen reflected the
average RDI for every chemotherapeutic and myelosuppressive agent contained therein. Planned RDI was
defined as that calculated to commence at initiation of
treatment as determined by the treating oncologist. The
secondary outcome measure in this study included the
frequency of actual or planned RDI <85% of the chemotherapy reference standard.

sons of categorical variables were made using the chisquare test. Cochran-Armitage Trend Test was used for
ordinal variables. All covariates were assessed for missing
values, and few values were absent (1 value for comorbidities, 2 for ECOG PS, and 10 for stage). For the analysis,
unknown values were grouped with either the largest or
the most medically relevant category.
Observations with missing outcome values were
excluded from the analysis with the respective outcome.
For both univariate and multivariate analyses, the RDI
categorization was based on values <85% or 85%. P <
.05 was considered to be statistically significant, and all
reported P values are 2-sided.

Hematopoietic Growth Factors
Frequency and timing of white blood cell growth factor use
was monitored during each chemotherapy cycle. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was administered to 99.9%
of patients who received growth factors. Only 1 patient
received granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor.
Administration of colony-stimulating factor (CSF) planned
at the beginning of the first cycle or before a neutropenic
event within the first cycle constituted primary prophylaxis.
All other CSF use was considered reactive. This analysis did
not include information on CSF dose or duration of use.
With respect to use of erythropoietin, only frequency of usage was monitored. Frequency referred to the
number of patients who received red cell growth factors.
Each patient was counted only once. No information
regarding the use of platelet-stimulating growth factors
was included in this dataset.
Statistical Methods
Within this cohort, patients aged 65 years were compared with patients aged <65 years with respect to types
of chemotherapy regimens, mean and median RDI of
chemotherapy, planned and unplanned reductions in
chemotherapy, and variations in type and extent of hematologic toxicities. The comparison of difference between
younger and older patients was planned at the outset of
the study, with ongoing monitoring of the proportion of
older patients enrolled.
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to assess the relation of demographic and
clinical variables with primary and secondary outcomes
within the older cohort (age 65 years). Group compariCancer

RESULTS
Of the 1224 patients with stage I to stage III breast cancer,
207 patients were 65 years old (grading determined
according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer
staging system). The mean and median ages for the older
patient group were 71.3 years and 70 years, respectively
(range, 65-85 years). Table 1 shows a comparison of
patient characteristics between the group of patients aged
65 years and those patients aged <65 years. Characteristics of the practice sites in which patients were treated did
not differ significantly between older and younger breast
cancer patients, including geographic region, practice
location, and practice size.
Data on hematologic toxicities were available for
1203 patients, 204 of whom were aged 65 years. There
was no statistically significant difference in hematologic
toxicity between older and younger patients during the
course of this study. Rates of FN or SN were similar
between the 2 groups, as were rates of anemia and thrombocytopenia, regardless of toxicity grade. Statistically significant differences were observed between older and
younger patients in terms of several clinical characteristics,
including disease stage, ECOG PS, number of comorbidities, serum creatinine >1.5 mg/dL, and ethnicity.
ECOG PS <2 was observed in 95.7% of the older
patients and 98.4% of the younger patients (P ¼ .01).
More of the younger patients had an ECOG PS of 0 as
compared with the older patients (P < .01). Not surprisingly, the younger patients had fewer comorbidities than
the older patients (P < .01), although <5% of the older
patients had 2 or more comorbidities. The older patients

events, including myocardial infarction or congestive
heart failure (4.9%) compared with the younger patients
(1.4%) (P < .01). In terms of ethnicity, there were fewer
non-Caucasian older patients as compared with the
younger patients (P < .01). Elevations in serum creatinine
were more common among elderly patients, which may
compromise renal excretion of several chemotherapeutic
agents, increasing the potential for drug toxicity, including myelosuppression.
Treatment variation that differed significantly
between older and younger patients included use of
anthracycline-containing regimens, planned RDI for
chemotherapy, and prophylactic CSF use. There was no
significant difference in overall CSF use between older
(57.5%) and younger patients (62.4%); however, significantly fewer older patients received prophylactic CSF during the course of the study (18.4%) compared with the
younger group of patients (28.0%) (P < .01). There was
no difference in the use of exogenous erythropoietin during this study between the older and younger patients
(approximately 40% in each group).
Prior chemotherapy use was documented in 10.6%
of the older patients and 7.8% of the younger patients

stage of disease groups.

(P < .01) (Fig. 1). The most common non–anthracycline-containing regimen used in the older cohort of
patients was cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil at 22.2%. This regimen was used in 7.8% of the
younger patients. Overall cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil use was 10.2%.
In the group of older patients, planned RDI was calculated in 199 (96.1%) patients, and actual RDI was calculated in 197 (95.2%). Both planned and actual RDI
differed significantly with increasing age (P < .01). The
mean actual RDI was 85.6% overall (standard deviation,
17.6%). Just over 1=3 of the older patients (34.0%) with
potentially curable breast cancer received an actual RDI
<85%. Planned RDI <85% was more common in older
patients (17.4%) as compared with younger patients
(12.3%; P ¼ .02). Figure 2 shows differences in actual

differences in chemotherapy-related hematologic toxicity
between older and younger patients. Specifically, no significant differences were observed between age groups in
terms of rates of FN, SN, anemia, or thrombocytopenia.
Several studies have addressed the issue of chemotherapy-related toxicity in older patients with breast
cancer.3,4,14,15,17 In contrast to our results, Muss et al.
examined toxicity of adjuvant chemotherapy in older and
younger breast cancer patients in the setting of the Cancer
and Leukemia Group B experience and reported that
patients aged 65 years were 68% more likely to develop
grade 4 leukopenia as compared with patients aged 50
years without increased mortality.17 Chemotherapyrelated hematologic toxicities in the older patients in our
study may have been abrogated by a significantly greater
frequency of reductions in planned and actual RDI of
chemotherapy for the older patients. In addition, the
decreased use of anthracyclines in this group of patients as
compared with the younger patient cohort may have led
to fewer chemotherapy-related hematologic toxicities.
Differences in treatment approach between older and
younger patients in our study may also explain the disCancer

crepant conclusions between our study and those of Cancer and Leukemia Group B, where a higher threshold for
implementing chemotherapy dose reduction or delay was
established through stringent protocol guidelines, with
specific predefined indications for such interventions.
Our study reflects the patterns of community practice,
where often clinical judgment alone regulates maintenance of chemotherapy RDI. Although it is encouraging
to find that rates of hematologic toxicities in this study
were no higher for older patients, it is concerning that this
finding was associated with significant reductions in both
planned and actual RDI for chemotherapy. This is all the
more notable because the older patients in this study had
comparably higher stage disease, wherein there should
have been a greater impetus to preserve chemotherapy
RDI in the curative setting.
Whereas all patients, regardless of age, in the Cancer
and Leukemia Group B study received an anthracyclinecontaining regimen,17 80.5% of the patients in this study
were treated with an anthracycline. Among patients aged
65 years, only 64.3% received such treatment, yet the
rate of neutropenic complications was significantly higher
5325

than that observed in younger anthracycline-treated
patients. The FN or SN trend in the setting of anthracycline use rose consistently with increasing age (P ¼ .01),
supporting the strong effect of age on anthracyclinerelated hematologic toxicity.
The older patients in the current study had a significantly greater number of comorbidities, as well as higher
overall ECOG PS as compared with the younger patients;
however, older breast cancer patients in this study received
less prophylactic CSF than their younger counterparts.
Therefore, greater supportive care in the older subgroup
of patients, at least with respect to prophylactic CSF,
could not be said to account for the similarities in
observed rates of hematologic toxicity. Erythropoietin was
used by approximately 40% of patients regardless of age.
Thus, the similar rates of anemia in older and younger
patients cannot be ascribed to increased use of erythropoietin in the older patients.
Despite the significant rate of chemotherapy dose
reductions in the older cohort used in this study (34%),
presumably as a means to reduce risk of treatment-related
hematologic and overall toxicities, approximately 40% of
patients aged 65 years did experience neutropenic complications. Although this rate is similar to that seen in the
younger cohort, these toxicities in older patients have
been associated with prolonged hospitalization29 and ultimately increased mortality.30
Several limitations of this study must be addressed.
Chemotherapy selection was at the discretion of the treating oncologist, with fewer older patients offered anthracyclines as part of a chemotherapy regimen compared with
younger patients. This is not surprising, because the risk
of cardiotoxicity from anthracyclines approximates 1%,31
and a greater proportion of older patients may be predisposed to development of cardiac complications.32 Indeed,
a significantly greater proportion of older patients in this
study had a prior history of myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure as compared with their younger counterparts. Before publication of data on the combination of
docetaxel and cyclophosphamide,33 clinicians concerned
about the potential for chemotherapy-related cardiotoxicity often elected to avoid anthracycline use and use the cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil regimen.
As such, the relatively high representation of regimens
such as cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil
observed in this analysis may not necessarily reflect the
5326

most current trends in choice of chemotherapy regimens
for older patients with breast cancer. Currently, the docetaxel and cyclophosphamide combination represents a
viable means of avoiding an anthracycline-containing regimen for management of early stage breast cancer. A follow-up report on the docetaxel and cyclophosphamide
combination34 supported the tolerability of this regimen
in older patients with breast cancer.
The older patients in this study were not as ethnically diverse as the younger patients, and this may call into
question the generalizability of our conclusions. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data demonstrate
that whereas age-adjusted incidence for breast cancer is
higher in whites than blacks, age-adjusted breast cancer
mortality rates are higher for blacks, regardless of age, as
compared with whites.35 Furthermore, overall mortality
rates secondary to comorbidities are higher in blacks compared with whites.36,37 Regardless of age, American Indian/Alaska natives and Asians have some of the lowest
rates of breast cancer incidence.38 Therefore, the proportional distribution of older breast cancer patients with
respect to race in this study is representative of national
trends, and as such our findings should indeed be
generalizable.
Increasing age has been identified as an independent
risk factor for nonreceipt of standard treatment for breast
cancer.39 This practice has been observed despite the survival advantage conferred in this population by chemotherapy, particularly for patients with estrogen receptornegative disease.15 Although this study highlights the significant dose reductions in chemotherapy RDI experienced by older breast cancer patients, it does not address
the more widespread issue of nonreceipt of chemotherapy
in this patient population. Comparison of this study with
the Cancer and Leukemia Group B13 data suggests that a
greater proportion of older breast cancer patients, when
they do receive chemotherapy, do so outside of a clinical
trial setting. Because the plan from the outset of this large
registry study was to compare data on older and younger
patients with respect to chemotherapy-related dosing and
toxicity, the proportion of patients aged 65 years old
was monitored throughout the enrollment period. Older
patients represented 33% to 40% of the entire study population across various tumor types. In the breast cancer
cohort the proportion of older patients with nonmetastatic disease was 16.9%. This is substantially greater than
Cancer

Chemotherapy Toxicity in Cancer Patients/Shayne et al

the 10% of patients aged 65 years represented in the
Cancer and Leukemia Group B experience.17 Such differences in the proportions of older patients per study reflect
the underrepresentation of older patients in clinical trials.
Yet despite this study having a more than 67% greater representation of older patients than the Cancer and Leukemia Group B study, the mean and median age of the
patients aged 65 years in this study were 71.3 years and
70 years (range, 65-85 years), respectively. This study is,
therefore, reflective of the ‘‘young old’’ population, in
which a lower prevalence of age-related events is expected.
As such, this study is highly selective, not only with respect
to functional status and comorbidity but also in terms of
age. The ongoing participation in clinical trials of older
patients with various functional levels is needed to provide
quality evidence on risks and benefits in this highly diverse
group of patients.
