Abstract

Introduction

Although hypovasculature is an outstanding characteristic of
pancreatic cancers, the tumor cells survive and proliferate
under severe hypoxic, glucose-deprived conditions caused by
low blood supply. It is well known that the hypoxia-inducible
factor-1 pathway is essential for the survival of pancreatic
cancer cells under hypoxic conditions. To discover how
pancreatic cancer cells adapt to glucose deprivation as well
as hypoxia, we sought glucose deprivation–inducible genes by
means of a DNA microarray system. We identified 63 genes
whose expression was enhanced under glucose-deprived
conditions at >2-fold higher levels than under normal glucose
conditions. Among these genes, asparagine synthetase (ASNS)
was studied in detail. Although it is known to be associated
with drug resistance in leukemia and oncogenesis triggered by
mutated p53, its function is yet to be determined. In this
study, we found that glucose deprivation induced the overexpression of ASNS through an AMP-activated protein kinase–
independent and activating transcription factor-4–dependent
manner and that ASNS protects pancreatic cancer cells from
apoptosis induced by glucose deprivation itself. ASNS overexpression also induced resistance to apoptosis triggered by
cisplatin [cis-diammine-dichloroplatinum (CDDP)] and carboplatin, but not by 5-fluorouracil, paclitaxel, etoposide, or
gemcitabine. We show that glucose deprivation induces the
activation of c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated
protein kinase (SAPK) in a mock transfectant but not in an
ASNS transfectant. Consequently, an inhibitor of JNK/SAPK
decreased the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells to apoptosis
by glucose deprivation and CDDP. These results strongly suggest
that ASNS is induced by glucose deprivation and may play a
pivotal role in the survival of pancreatic cancer cells under
glucose-deprived conditions. [Cancer Res 2007;67(7):3345–55]

As solid tumors outgrow the existing vasculature, they are
continuously exposed to a microenvironment in which the supply
of oxygen is limited. Adaptation to such a microenvironment
through angiogenesis and increased glycolysis, two universal
characteristics of solid tumors, is regulated by hypoxia-inducible
factor-1 (HIF-1) and is critical to the sustenance of neoplastic
proliferation (1–3). Because oxygen homeostasis represents an
indispensable organizing principle for human physiology (4), the
requirement for oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP is
nevertheless balanced at the cost of oxidative damage to cellular
compositions (5). As a tumor expands, vigorous growth of cancer
cells creates a hypoxic microenvironment, which, if not alleviated,
may restrict tumor growth or even cause cell death (6). In vivo
studies have shown very convincingly that the areas of tumors
stained with hypoxia markers, such as pimonidazole, show
reduced proliferation and an increased fraction of apoptotic
cells (7). Several in vitro studies have also shown that hypoxia
induces apoptosis through the activation of HIF-1 (6, 8). However,
these studies use a variety of experimental conditions, most often
combining reduced oxygen conditions with additional apoptogenic conditions such as glucose and/or serum deprivation. A
recent report showed that hypoxia alone (<0.5% oxygen) did not
alter the growth of fibroblasts and cancer cells and that anoxia
(<0.01% oxygen) induced apoptosis in a HIF-1–independent
manner (9), suggesting that hypoxia alone is not sufficient to
result in apoptosis. Additionally, areas of tumors that have poor
perfusion and reduced delivery of oxygen could also suffer from
other kinds of stress, such as low glucose. Glucose, in particular,
is an indispensable nutrient under hypoxic conditions because
enhanced glucose uptake and glycolysis compensate for the lack
of energy production by aerobic metabolism under normoxic
conditions (10–12). Indeed, it has been reported that hypoxia
causes apoptosis in myocytes only in the absence of glucose and
that the presence of as little as 1 mmol/L glucose before
exposure to hypoxia prevents apoptosis (13). These findings
suggest that glucose-deprived conditions, rather than hypoxic
conditions, may be a pivotal contributing factor for the death of
cancer cells in the tumor microenvironments, which are always
associated with an insufficient supply of glucose, as well as
oxygen.

Cancer Research

Enhanced anaerobic metabolism, through the enhanced expression of glycolytic enzymes and glucose transporters, is an important hypoxia-induced adaptation response to glucose-deprived
conditions. Although under hypoxic glucose-deprived conditions
in vivo, anaerobic metabolism could function through the
enhanced uptake of glucose, which is supplied at very low levels
albeit continuously, other mechanisms of tolerance to glucosedeprived conditions might be required. Previous reports showed
that hypoxia conferred tolerance to glucose deprivation through
the activation of AMP–activated protein kinase (AMPK; refs. 14,
15). Therefore, we hypothesized that glucose deprivation itself
might be inducing tolerance to the same glucose deprivation in
tumor tissues, where the cells are exposed to hypoxia and glucose
deprivation. Cancer cells might be acquiring a tolerance for glucose
deficiency during their progression, in addition to the ability to
stimulate angiogenesis and glycolysis as hypoxic responses.
To test this hypothesis, we selected a pancreatic cancer cell line
as a model because pancreatic cancers are well known to be
hypovascular tumors, as determined by means of clinical
angiography (16), and sought to identify glucose deprivation–
inducible genes by a DNA microarray system. We identified 63
genes whose expressions were enhanced under glucose-deprived
conditions at >2-fold higher levels than under normal glucose
conditions. Among those genes, we chose asparagine synthetase
(ASNS) for further study because its mRNA expression levels were
the highest among the genes tested by real-time PCR, and its
function(s) under glucose-deprived conditions are yet to be determined. Additionally, it has been reported that its expression is
enhanced by amino acid deprivation and glucose deprivation and
that it is related to drug resistance of leukemia and oncogenesis
triggered by mutated p53 (17, 18). ASNS encodes an enzyme that
catalyzes the biosynthesis of L-asparagine from L-aspartate in an
ATP-dependent reaction for which L-glutamine is the nitrogen
source (19). ASNS expression in mammalian tissues is highly
regulated by the nutritional status of the cells (20) and is enhanced
by glucose deprivation as well as amino acid deprivation (21). The
up-regulation of ASNS transcription upon nutrient stress suggests
that ASNS may be a critical cellular defense gene against glucose
deprivation itself, although the exact roles of overexpressed ASNS
under nutrient-deprived conditions have not yet been extensively
investigated. To explore this potential defensive feature of ASNS,
we examined the roles of ASNS under glucose-deprived conditions
in pancreatic cancer cells by silencing ASNS with small interfering
RNAs (siRNA) and establishing transfectants overexpressing ASNS.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. BxPC3, PCI43, and MiaPaCa2 pancreatic cancer cells were
cultured in DMEM containing 100 mg/dL glucose (Nissui Pharmaceutical
Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS;
Japan Bioserum Co., Ltd., Nagoya, Japan), penicillin (25 units/mL), and
streptomycin (25 Ag/mL). Because normal glucose concentrations in human
peripheral blood range between 70 and 200 mg/dL, we used DMEM
containing 100 mg/dL glucose. Thus, a concentration of 100 mg/dL is
defined as ‘‘normal glucose’’ in our study. As hypoglycemia in human
peripheral blood delineates <50 mg/dL glucose, <50 mg/dL glucose in
DMEM is defined as ‘‘low glucose’’ in our study. Oxygen concentration in
tumor tissues is f1.25% (about one tenth that in peripheral blood); thus,
glucose concentration in tumor tissues could also be estimated to be
around one tenth that in peripheral blood. Therefore, the cultures carried
out under glucose-deprived conditions were done in glucose-free DMEM,
supplemented with 10% FBS (the final concentration of glucose in this
medium was 10 mg/dL, as measured in our laboratory), unless otherwise

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (7). April 1, 2007

specified. In some experiments, glucose-free DMEM supplemented with
10% FBS and 15 or 40 mg/dL glucose ( final concentration of glucose in the
medium being 25 or 50 mg/dL) was used. The cells used for the experiments
were mainly MiaPaCa2 cells, unless otherwise specified.
Antibodies and chemical reagents. Anti-Flag M2 monoclonal antibody,
anti-actin antibody, anti–phospho-stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/
c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK; Thr183/Tyr185) antibody, and anti–SAPK/
JNK antibody were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO),
Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and Cell Signaling Technology
(Danvers, MA), respectively. The supernatant from a cloned mouse
hybridoma cell line, HL 512 (3G6-2G8), which secretes an antibody
[immunoglobulin G (IgG)-2a subclass] that recognizes human ASNS, was
used as antihuman ASNS antibody. This was kindly provided by Dr. Sheldon
Schuster (Department of Biochemistry, University of Florida, Gainesville,
FL). Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, peroxidase-conjugated
goat anti-rabbit IgG, and peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG
antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories
(West Grove, PA). Cisplatin [cis-diammine-dichloroplatinum (CDDP)] and
gemcitabine were kind gifts from Pfizer (Tokyo, Japan) and Eli Lilly (Kobe,
Japan), respectively. 5-Fluoruracil (5-FU) was purchased from Calbiochem
(La Jolla, CA) whereas paclitaxel, etoposide (VP-16), and carboplatin were
kind gifts from Bristol Pharmaceuticals Y.K. (Tokyo, Japan). Compound C,
an AMPK inhibitor, was purchased from Calbiochem. The JNK1-3 inhibitor
SP600125 was bought from Biomol International (Plymouth Meeting, PA).
Hydrogen peroxide (30% solution) was purchased from Wako Pure
Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan).
DNA microarray analysis. Total RNA was extracted with the use of
TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Tokyo, Japan) from MiaPaca2 cells that
had been incubated for 16 h under glucose-deprived conditions or normal
glucose conditions. The glucose concentrations were 10 and 100 mg/dL,
respectively. mRNA was purified from total RNA with the use of a
QuickPrep mRNA Purification Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Tokyo,
Japan). The differentially expressed genes were screened using a DNA
microarray system (Hokkaido System Science, Sapporo, Japan). We defined
the genes that were expressed at >2-fold intensity under glucose-deprived
conditions than under normal glucose conditions as possible glucose
deprivation–inducible genes in this study.
Sensitivity to anticancer drugs. Sensitivity of tumor cell lines to
anticancer drugs was determined by a colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner
salt (MTS) assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Cell Titer
96 Aqueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay, Promega, Madison,
WI). Briefly, cells were inoculated in 96-well plates (8  103 per well) and
incubated overnight in a humidified CO2 incubator (95% air/5% CO2) in
triplicate, to allow the cells to adhere and assume a healthy condition, and
then exposed to different doses of anticancer drugs for 48 h under normal
glucose conditions. The cells were then incubated for a further 3 h with
MTS solution. Subsequently, the absorbance was measured at 490 nm on an
ELISA plate reader (model 680, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).
Apoptosis assay. Sensitivity of tumor cell lines to apoptosis was
determined by two-color fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis
using propidium iodide– and FITC-conjugated anti–Annexin V antibody
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche Diagnostics GmbH,
Germany). Briefly, after incubating the cells for 48 h under normal glucose
conditions or under glucose-deprived conditions, the cells were stained with
propidium iodide– and FITC-conjugated anti–Annexin V and then analyzed
with a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Apoptotic
cell death was also examined by staining the cells with Hoechst-33342
(Molecular Probes) without fixation. Apoptotic cells were identified by
characteristic bright blue fluorescence of nuclei due to condensed or
fragmented chromatin. Digital images were acquired with an inverted light
microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE300, Nikon Instech Co. Ltd., Kawasaki, Japan)
attached to a 100-W halogen lamp source (Nikon Halogen 12V-100W, Nikon
Instech) and a charge-coupled device camera (Nikon Coolpix 4500, Nikon).
Western blot analysis. Cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling
Technology) and whole-cell lysates (40 Ag) were run on 10% polyacrylamide
gels and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes

were blocked with blocking buffer (5% skimmed milk in 1% Tween-PBS),
probed with primary antibodies overnight at 4jC, incubated with a
secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, and developed with the
use of an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham, Tokyo,
Japan).
Real-time PCR. Total RNA was extracted with the use of TRIZOL
reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Each RNA sample
(10 Ag) was subjected to cDNA synthesis by means of Moloney murine
leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Each cDNA (10 ng) was amplified in triplicate with the use of the
Quantitect SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for 40 cycles
(94jC for 15 s, 60jC for 30 s, and 72jC for 1 min) on an ABI PRISM 7900HT
Sequence Detection System. The primers used were as follows: ASNS
forward primer, CTGCACGCCCTCTATGACA; ASNS reverse primer, TAAAAGGCAGCCAATCCTTCT; h-actin forward primer, TTGCCGACAGGATGCAGAA; h-actin reverse primer, GCCGATCCACACGGAGTACT. Relative
mRNA levels were determined by comparing the PCR cycle thresholds
between the cDNA of ASNS and that of h-actin.
siRNA preparation and transfection. The antisense sequences of the
siRNAs for human ASNS were as follows: AAGAUUGCACACAGAGGUCCA,
AAAGUGUUCCUGGGUAGAGAU, and AAAGAAGCCCAAGUACAGUA.
These were designed using the Silencer siRNA Construction Kit (Ambion,
Inc., Austin, TX). A nonsilencing control siRNA was purchased from Qiagen
(Valencia, CA). siRNA transfection using 5 nmol/L siRNA was done with
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) at 30% to 40% cell confluence in an
antibiotic-free medium. A cocktail of three siRNAs for human activating
transcription factor-4 (ATF-4; siTrio Full Set) was purchased from B-Bridge
International (Sunnyvale, CA) and used at 5 nmol/L concentrations. The
antisense sequences for these siRNAs were as follows: UUCUCCAACAUCCAAUCUG, AUCUCCUUCAGUGAUAUCC, and UUCUUAUCCAGUUUCUCAC.
Establishment of ASNS transfectants. A cDNA for ASNS was amplified
from reverse transcription products of mRNAs purified from MiaPaCa2
cells and cloned into p3XFLAG-cytomegalovirus-14 (CMV-14). PCR primers
for the full-length cDNA of ASNS were as follows: forward primer,
5¶-GACTGCGGCCGCATAGCTTCATTGCACCA-3¶; reverse primer, 5¶-CAGTAGATCTGCTTTGACAGCTGACTTG-3¶. Plasmids were sequenced with a
BigDye Version 3 Sequence Kit (Applied Biosystems, Tokyo, Japan) on an
ABI Prism 3100-Avant automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cloned fragments were ligated into
p3XFLAG-CMV-14 (Sigma Chemical). MiaPaCa2 cells were transfected with
the expression vector alone (mock transfectant) or the expression vector
containing the cloned fragments (ASNS transfectant) with the use of

dilution method following selection with G-418 (Sigma; 1,200 Ag/mL). The
transfectants were then maintained in the presence of 600 Ag/mL G-418.
Statistical analysis. Real-time PCR results are represented as mean F

confidence intervals (95% CI). Statistical differences among the groups were

Results
Genes whose expression was enhanced under glucosedeprived conditions. Representative genes whose expression
was enhanced under glucose-deprived conditions compared with
normal glucose conditions were classified into several categories
(Table 1). Our analysis revealed a total of 63 genes up-regulated in
MiaPaCa2 cells under glucose-deprived conditions when compared
with normal glucose conditions. Because our result comes from
a single microarray analysis, conclusions from our analysis cannot
be made without further validation of the microarray results by
another method, such as real-time PCR. Among the identified
genes, ASNS was chosen for further study. Recent reports showed
that its expression is enhanced by amino acid deprivation and
glucose deprivation and that it is related to drug resistance of
leukemia and oncogenesis triggered by mutated p53 (17, 18),
whereas its function(s) are yet to be determined.
Expression of ASNS under normal glucose/glucose-deprived
and hypoxic/normoxic conditions. We examined the expression
of ASNS mRNA by real-time PCR in three pancreatic cancer cell
lines. In these cell lines, ASNS mRNA was expressed at higher levels
following 16-h incubation under glucose-deprived conditions than
under normal glucose conditions (Fig. 1A). The increase in ASNS
mRNA expression was sustained under glucose-deprived conditions in time course experiments (starting from 16 h and lasting up
to 48 h; Fig. 1B). Various concentrations of glucose, ranging from
50 to 10 mg/dL, increased the expression of ASNS mRNA (Fig. 1C).
Hypoxia alone increased the expression of ASNS mRNA in one of
three cell lines (data not shown). ASNS protein expression was
also higher under glucose-deprived conditions than under normal

glucose conditions (Fig. 1D). As AMPK has been reported to be an
energy sensor (22–24), we then examined the implication of AMPK
in the induction of ASNS expression under glucose-deprived
conditions. Compound C, an inhibitor of AMPK, has no effect on
the enhanced expression of ASNS induced by glucose deprivation
(Fig. 1E). We then confirmed the role of ATF-4 in the induction
of ASNS under glucose-deprived conditions because amino acid
deprivation and glucose deprivation have been reported to
stimulate the expression of ASNS through the activation of ATF-4
(25, 26). siRNAs for ATF-4 almost completely suppressed the
enhanced expression of ASNS under glucose-deprived conditions

(Fig. 1F). These results suggest that the expression of ASNS under
glucose-deprived conditions is induced in an ATF-4–dependent but
AMPK-independent manner.
Silencing of ASNS by siRNA sensitizes pancreatic cancer
cells to apoptosis. We then examined the roles of ASNS using
siRNAs for ASNS. We made three siRNAs, all of which effectively
suppressed both the mRNA and protein expressions of ASNS
(Fig. 2A and B). More than 95% of the cells were viable under
normal glucose conditions. Although f50% of the cells treated
with a control siRNA were viable under glucose-deprived
conditions, the percentages of viable cells treated with two siRNAs

Figure 2. Effects of siRNAs for ASNS on the sensitivity to apoptosis. A, MiaPaca2 cells were transfected with 5 nmol/L siRNA for ASNS, under normal glucose and
glucose-deprived conditions, and total RNA was extracted 48 h after transfection. ASNS mRNAs were analyzed by real-time PCR. The relative copy number to
h-actin in the cells treated with control siRNA, under normal or low-glucose conditions, was artificially defined as one. All siRNAs for ASNS efficiently suppressed the
expression of ASNS mRNA. Representative results of three independent experiments. Columns, mean of triplicate wells; bars, SD. *, P < 0.05. B, MiaPaca2
cells were transfected with 5 nmol/L siRNA for ASNS, under normal glucose and glucose-deprived conditions, and whole-cell lysates were prepared 48 h after

for ASNS (siRNA245 and siRNA572) decreased to f20% and 7%
under glucose-deprived conditions (Fig. 2C). These results suggest
that overexpression of ASNS under glucose-deprived conditions
plays an important role in the protection of cancer cells from
apoptosis induced by glucose-deprived conditions. In addition to
apoptosis induced by glucose deprivation, we examined the effects
of silencing ASNS during treatment with an anticancer drug,
CDDP. The cells treated with siRNAs for ASNS under glucosedeprived conditions were also more sensitive to apoptosis induced
by CDDP, which, by itself, did not induce the expression of ASNS
mRNA (Supplementary Fig. S1A), than those treated with a control
siRNA (Fig. 2D, top). Under normal glucose conditions, siRNAs for
ASNS showed no effect on the sensitivity to apoptosis induced
by CDDP (Fig. 2D, bottom). These results suggest that glucose
deprivation induced resistance to CDDP through the enhanced
expression of ASNS.

Overexpression of ASNS protects cancer cells from apoptosis.
We then established MiaPaCa2 cell lines overexpressing ASNS
constitutively. Before cloning, we examined the sensitivity of the
ASNS transfectants to apoptosis induced by glucose deprivation
and confirmed that they were significantly more resistant to
apoptosis than the mock transfectant (Fig. 3A). Staining with
Hoechst-33342 showed that more than half of the mock-transfected
cells cultured under low-glucose conditions showed bright
fluorescence, representing apoptotic cells, whereas nuclei of the
ASNS-transfected cells displayed only dim staining, except for the
small fraction (Fig. 3B). Two transfectant clones expressing Flagtagged ASNS were selected for further experiments (Fig. 3C). These
two ASNS transfectant clones were also more resistant to apoptosis
induced by glucose deprivation than the mock-transfectant
(Fig. 3D). Viable cells were examined by means of the MTS assay
after incubating mock-transfected cells and ASNS-transfected cells

under low-glucose conditions for up to 48 h (Supplementary
Fig. S1B). After 24 and 48 h of incubation, f100% and 50%,
respectively, of the ASNS-transfected cells were viable, whereas the
percentages of the viable mock-transfected cells were significantly
lower than those of the ASNS-transfected cells. We then examined
the expression levels of bcl-2 family proteins (bcl-2, bcl-xL, and
Bax) in the transfectants, but we could not find any difference in
bcl-2 family protein expressions between the mock transfectant
and the ASNS transfectants (data not shown). We proceeded to
examine the activation status of stress-inducible kinases such as
JNK/SAPK. We found that glucose deprivation clearly activated

JNK/SAPK in the mock transfectant but not in the ASNS
transfectant (clone 7; Fig. 3E). Moreover, an inhibitor of JNK
increased the percentage of viable MiaPaCa2 parent cells cultured
under glucose-deprived conditions for 24 h in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 3F). These results suggest that overexpression of
ASNS, induced by glucose deprivation, plays an important role in
the survival of pancreatic cancer cells through the suppression of
JNK activation under glucose-deprived conditions. Furthermore,
the sensitivity of uncloned ASNS transfectants to apoptosis induced
by CDDP, under normal glucose conditions, was significantly lower
than that of the mock transfectant (Supplementary Fig. S1C). When

we examined the sensitivity of the ASNS-transfected clones to other
anticancer drugs, the ASNS transfectants were more resistant to
CDDP and carboplatin but not to 5-FU, VP-16, paclitaxel, or
gemcitabine than the mock transfectant (Fig. 4A–F).
Sensitivity of MiaPaCa2 parent cells to CDDP in the presence
of asparagine. Because overexpression of ASNS induces the
accumulation of asparagine in the cells, we then examined the
effect of the addition of L-asparagine into the medium. Higher
concentrations of asparagine in the medium (up to 20 mmol/L)
showed no effect on the sensitivity of MiaPaCa2 parent cells to
CDDP (Fig. 5A).
Phosphorylation of JNK in ASNS transfectants treated with
CDDP or 5-FU. We also examined the activation of JNK/SAPK in
the cells treated with CDDP and 5-FU. We found that CDDP, but
not 5-FU, induced a significant activation of JNK/SAPK in the mock
transfectant (Fig. 5B). Overexpression of ASNS suppressed the

activation of JNK/SAPK induced by CDDP in the ASNS transfectant
(clone 7; Fig. 5B). We then examined the effects of a JNK inhibitor
on the sensitivity of the MiaPaCa2 parent cells to CDDP to mimic
the inhibiting effects of ASNS on JNK. As predicted, treatment of
the cells with the inhibitor of JNK for 48 h increased the percentage
of viable MiaPaCa2 parent cells treated with CDDP compared with
the control. However, it did not show any effect on the numbers of
viable cells treated with 5-FU (Fig. 5C).

Discussion
Here, we clearly show that glucose deprivation induces the
expression of ASNS, in accordance with previous reports (10, 27),
and that the enhanced expression of ASNS protects pancreatic
cancer cells from apoptosis induced by glucose deprivation
through the suppression of JNK/SAPK activation. These results

show for the first time that ASNS, induced by glucose deprivation,
is implicated in adaptation responses to the same glucose-deprived
conditions, frequently observed in tumor tissues. Furthermore, we
show that the enhanced expression of ASNS protects pancreatic
cancer cells from apoptosis induced by CDDP and that this
resistance to CDDP is also mediated through the suppression of
JNK/SAPK activation. As recent studies showed that potent ASNS
inhibitors may have clinical usefulness in treating childhood acute
lymphoblastic leukemia, which overexpresses ASNS (17), we
envisage that inhibitors of ASNS may also become a beneficial
tool for treating pancreatic cancers.
ASNS encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the glutamine- and
ATP-dependent conversion of aspartic acid to asparagine (19). The
expression of ASNS is enhanced by amino acid deprivation, and
this regulation is transcriptional in nature (20). A recent report
showed that the human ASNS gene is also activated when cells are
incubated in the absence of glucose (21). The cellular significance
of ASNS overexpression induced by glucose deprivation is not yet
fully understood, although it is reported that ASNS may be a serum

www.aacrjournals.org

marker for neoplasias (28) and is related with cell cycle regulation
(29) and resistance to apoptosis induced by L-asparaginase (30).
As the addition of L-asparagine in the culture medium had no effect
on the resistance to CDDP, it seems unlikely that ASNS may induce
resistance to apoptosis through the accumulation of L-asparagine,
produced by ASNS. Our work reveals that glucose deprivation,
CDDP, and carboplatin, but not 5-FU, activated JNK/SAPK and
that the overexpression of ASNS suppressed this activation. These
results suggest that glucose deprivation and CDDP may induce
apoptosis, at least partially, through the activation of JNK/SAPK
and that the overexpression of ASNS may inhibit apoptosis through
the suppression of this JNK/SAPK activation. Unlike our results,
several reports showed that 5-FU and other anticancer drugs also
induced apoptosis through the activation of JNK/SAPK (31–34).
Contrastingly, the genetic removal of SEK-1, an immediate
upstream activator kinase of JNK, promoted apoptosis of
hepatocytes and T cells (35, 36), which proposes that JNK has a
dual role in cell survival. These contradictory results suggest that
the role of the activation of JNK in cell survival is still unclear.

Cancer Research

A definite mechanism for the role of ASNS in cell survival also
remains to be determined.
Our results show that ATF-4, but not AMPK, is involved in the
induction of ASNS expression by glucose deprivation. Glucose
deprivation induces two major cellular response pathways: an
unfolded protein response pathway and an AMPK-dependent
signaling pathway (22, 23, 37, 38). AMPK is an energy sensor that
regulates the energy balance within the cell by means of switching
off ATP-consuming pathways and switching on ATP-generating
pathways (22). Because it has been reported that glucose
deprivation increased the mRNA level of some hypoxia-inducible
genes, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), glucosetransporter 1 (Glut-1), and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6biphosphatase-3 (PKFKB3; ref. 39), we assumed that AMPK was
involved in enhancing the expression of ASNS mRNA under
glucose-deprived conditions. However, our result clearly shows that
AMPK is not involved in the signal transduction pathway for ASNS
induction. Our finding on ATF-4 is consistent with previous reports
showing that ATF-4 is one of the mediators of the nutrient-sensing
response pathway, also known as the unfolded protein response
pathway, which activates the human ASNS gene (25, 26). It is well
known that many disturbances in the normal functions of the
endoplasmic reticulum lead to the unfolded protein response
pathway, which is aimed initially at compensating for damage
but can eventually trigger cell death if endoplasmic reticulum
dysfunction is severe and prolonged (37). Hypoxia and CDDP, as
well as glucose deprivation, also lead to endoplasmic reticulum
stress and then the unfolded protein response pathway (37, 40, 41).
In our study, hypoxia induced the expression of ASNS mRNA in
only one of the three cell lines tested (data not shown).
Furthermore, CDDP, which has been reported to induce endoplasmic reticulum stress, did not increase the expression of ASNS
mRNA (Supplementary Fig. S1A). All these results suggest that
ATF-4 is an essential transcription factor for enhanced expression
of ASNS under glucose-deprived conditions and that glucose
deprivation may activate an ATF-4 pathway independently of
endoplasmic reticulum stress.

Because tumor tissues are exposed to glucose-deprived conditions, as well as hypoxic conditions, adaptation responses against
hypoxia through the activation of the HIF-1 pathway are not
enough for the survival of solid tumor cells in vivo. Recently, we
have reported that transforming growth factor-h was involved in
the tolerance to glucose starvation under hypoxic conditions (15).
This finding indicates that hypoxia induces the adaptation
responses to glucose deprivation under hypoxic, glucose-deprived
conditions. Our question in this study was whether glucose
deprivation itself induces any adaptation responses to hypoxic,
glucose-deprived conditions. Our present results clearly indicate
that one effect of glucose deprivation is the induction of adaptation
responses to apoptosis brought about by the same glucose
deprivation. We now propose that glucose deprivation itself
induces the adaptation responses of cancer cells to the tumor
microenvironment other than the HIF-1 pathway activated by
hypoxia.
Collectively, our results provide evidence that glucose deprivation induces the overexpression of ASNS in pancreatic cancer
cells, which in turn leads to resistance to apoptosis. Consequently,
ASNS overexpression suppresses the activation of JNK/SAPK, thus
inhibiting death signal transduction. Hence, ASNS may very well be
an important therapeutic target for pancreatic cancers, as well as
acute lymphoid leukemias.
