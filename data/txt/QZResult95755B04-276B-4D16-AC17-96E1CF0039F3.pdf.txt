Abstract
Invasion and dissemination of medulloblastoma within the central nervous system is the principal factor
predicting medulloblastoma treatment failure and death. Netrin-1 is an axon guidance factor implicated in
tumor and vascular biology, including in invasive behaviors. We found that exogenous netrin-1 stimulated
invasion of human medulloblastoma cells and endothelial cells in contrast to VEGF-A, which promoted
invasion of endothelial cells but not medulloblastoma cells. Furthermore, medulloblastoma cells expressed
endogenous netrin-1 along with its receptors, neogenin and UNC5B. Blockades in endogenous netrin-1,
neogenin, or UNC5B reduced medulloblastoma invasiveness. Neogenin blockade inhibited netrin-1–induced
endothelial cells tube formation and recruitment of endothelial cells into Matrigel plugs, two hallmarks of
angiogenesis. In patients with pediatric medulloblastoma, netrin-1 mRNA levels were increased 1.7-fold in
medulloblastoma tumor specimens compared with control specimens from the same patient. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that netrin-1 was elevated in medulloblastoma tumors versus cerebellum
controls. Notably, urinary levels of netrin-1 were 9-fold higher in patients with medulloblastoma compared
with control individuals. Moreover, urinary netrin-1 levels were higher in patients with invasive medulloblastoma compared with patients with noninvasive medulloblastoma. Finally, we noted that urinary netrin-1
levels diminished after medulloblastoma resection in patients. Our results suggest netrin-1 is a candidate
biomarker capable of detecting an invasive, disseminated phenotype in patients with medulloblastoma and
predicting their disease status. Cancer Res; 74(14); 3716–26. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Medulloblastoma, a malignant embryonal tumor in the
cerebellum, is the most common malignant pediatric brain
tumor. About 3,700 cases of brain embryonal tumors were
reported in the United States between 2005 and 2009 (Central
Brain Tumor Registry of the United States, CBTRUS; ref. 1).
Outcomes have markedly improved, with subgroups of patients

achieving near 90% 5-year survival rates; however, critical to
this success is the ability to achieve a complete or nearcomplete surgical resection, without tumor invasion or dissemination. For younger children (especially younger than 2
years of age) with invasive or disseminated medulloblastoma,
the 5-year survival rate can be as low as 32% (2). There is a
clear clinical imperative to improve the understanding of
the mechanisms underlying invasion and dissemination in
medulloblastoma.
Genomic analysis of medulloblastoma has identiﬁed subgroups that correlate with clinical outcome, better deﬁning
tumors prone to invasion and dissemination. Medulloblastoma has been stratiﬁed into four subgroups: WNT, Shh
(Sonic hedgehog), Group 3, and Group 4 (3). Shh-medulloblastoma is the best characterized subgroup. Although the
Shh group has an overall survival rate that falls in the middle
of the four subgroups, a distinct subset of invasive, anaplastic Shh tumors has the worst prognosis of any group, underscoring the impact of invasion on survival. Shh activity is
relevant to netrin-1 because neogenin, a netrin receptor, is a
Shh target in medulloblastoma and is required for medulloblastoma cell-cycle progression (4). The expression of
another axonal guidance receptor, neuropilin 1 (NRP1),

Netrin-1 Induces Medulloblastoma Invasion and Angiogenesis

correlates with poor overall survival in patients with medulloblastoma, but receptor blockade inhibits the growth and
metastasis of medulloblastoma (5). Recent studies in our lab
have shown that netrin-1 promotes invasiveness and angiogenesis in another brain tumor, glioblastoma, by activating
the cysteine protease cathepsin B (CatB; ref. 6).
Netrin-1 is a 60 to 80 kDa laminin-like protein, originally
demonstrated to serve as an axon guidance molecule during
neural development of Caenorhabditis elegans (7). The netrin
family consists of three secreted netrins [netrin-1, netrin-3
(also known as netrin-2 chicken-like) and netrin-4]. Their
activities are mediated by several receptors, including uncoordinated5A–D (UNC5A–D), deleted in colorectal cancer
(DCC), its orthologue neogenin and Down syndrome cell
adhesion molecule (DSCAM). During brain development,
ﬂoor plate–secreted netrin-1 diffuses and establishes a gradient to attract growing commissural axons that express
netrin receptors to the midline of the central nervous system
(7, 8).
Netrin-1 is active outside of the nervous system, contributing to inﬂammation (9), ischemia in the brain (10) and kidney
(11), and tumor progression and angiogenesis (6). Upregulation of netrin-1 mRNA and protein in tumors has been shown
in colon cancer (12), neuroblastoma (13), pancreatic cancer
(14), and non–small cell lung carcinoma (15). Elevated levels of
netrin-1 and UNC5B have been observed in patients with
breast cancer with distant metastasis (16); however, the functional role of netrin-1 and its receptors in medulloblastoma is
not fully understood.
In this report, we have demonstrated that recombinant
netrin-1 stimulates medulloblastoma cell invasion in four
selected human medulloblastoma cell lines in vitro and that
netrin-1 levels are elevated in human medulloblastoma
tissues. We analyzed the function of netrin-1 and its receptors, UNC5B and neogenin, in these human medulloblastoma cell lines. Blockage of endogenous netrin-1 and/or its
receptor neogenin by antibody or siRNA results in the
suppression of medulloblastoma cell invasiveness. Netrin1 is also active on endothelial cells. It stimulates primary
mouse brain endothelial cells invasion, tube formation
in vitro, and endothelial cells invasion into Matrigel plugs
in mice.
These results suggest that netrin-1 might regulate medulloblastoma invasiveness in the clinic. In fact, pediatric
medulloblastoma tumor specimens demonstrate signiﬁcant
elevation of netrin-1 mRNA and protein relative to normal
brain tissue. Urinary analysis is a useful approach to measure soluble protein concentrations noninvasively. We ﬁrst
reported the use of urinary biomarkers, such as MMP-2,
MMP-9, and VEGF, in pediatric brain tumors (17). Netrin-1 is
a secreted molecule and, thus, might be released into urine.
Accordingly, we measured urinary netrin-1 levels to identify
medulloblastoma presence and also response to medulloblastoma therapy. This unique approach revealed clinical
utility, with excellent diagnostic accuracy in differentiating
between medulloblastoma and control patients and with the
ability to identify the invasive/metastatic phenotype and
effective response to therapeutic interventions. We conclude

www.aacrjournals.org

that the netrin-1/neogenin pathway holds promise as a novel
therapeutic target to inhibit medulloblastoma cell invasiveness and angiogenesis and that measurement of netrin-1
levels demonstrates utility as a noninvasive, diagnostic, and
prognostic biomarker.

Patients and Methods
Cell culture
D425, D458, and D556 human medulloblastoma cells were
supplied by the American Type Culture Collection. D283 cells
were kindly provided by Dr. R. Jain (Massachusetts General
Hospital, Boston, MA). Cells were cultured in Modiﬁed Eagle's
Medium (Gibco) for D283 or DMEM/F12 medium (Gibco) for
D425, D458, and D556 and supplemented with 10% FBS.
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC; Lonza) were
cultured in EGM2 (Lonza). Mouse brain capillary endothelial
cells were isolated from nude mice as described previously (6).
Endothelial cells were cultured in EGM-2MV (Lonza) supplemented with 10% FBS. The primary cells were used within 7
passages.
Recombinant netrin protein
The netrin-1/pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO plasmid was transfected into 293 T cells using FuGENE HD Transfection Reagent
(Roche Applied Science) to express His- and V5-tagged netrin-1
protein. Netrin-1 secreted into culture medium was puriﬁed on
HiTrap HP Chelating columns (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences
Corp.) as previously described by us (6, 18). Recombinant
chicken netrin-2 (127-N2) and human netrin-4 (1254-N4) were
purchased from R&D Systems.
Invasion assays
Invasion assays were performed in Transwells (Corning
Glass) with an 8.0-mm pore size and coated with BD Matrigel
Basement Membrane Matrix (BD Biosciences; 0.1 mg/mL) as
described by us previously (6). Cells that had migrated
through the ﬁlters after 16 (for medulloblastoma cell lines)
or 24 (for endothelial cells) hours at 37 C were stained with
the Diff-Quick Cell Staining Kit (Dade Behring Inc.), and four
ﬁelds were counted by phase microscopy. For netrin-1
blocking experiments, cells were incubated with 20 mg/mL
of neutralizing antibody to netrin-1 (R&D Systems).
Patient population
Tissue and urine were collected as part of an institutional
review board-approved protocol at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH). All of the pediatric patients (age 18 years
and younger; n ¼ 16) presented with previously undiagnosed, untreated tumors and had urine collected before
surgery. Tumors were evident on magnetic resonance imaging studies at the time of specimen collection. No pediatric
patients had known histories of vascular malformations
or recent surgery (within 3 months of specimen collection).
All tumor diagnoses were conﬁrmed with neuropathology.
Control patients were healthy, age- and gender-matched.
Normal cerebellum tissue for immunohistochemistry was
purchased from US Biomax, Inc., Gene Tex, Inc., and
Abcam.

Urine collection
Once collected, urine was transported on ice to our laboratory, stored at 20 C, then analyzed with ELISA as previously described by us (17).
Tissue collection
Tissue specimens were obtained from the Division of Neuropathology at BCH. Representative tumor tissue was selected
and 5-mm-thick sections were prepared from parafﬁn-embedded tissue.
Immunohistochemistry
All tissues were processed by our core histopathology
laboratory as part of clinical care and neuropathology review
to conﬁrm diagnosis. Netrin-1 expression was evaluated by
immunohistochemical analysis using rabbit polyclonal antinetrin-1 antibody (Novus Biologicals, NBP1-19822). Formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded tissue sections were mounted
on microscope slides. Following the Closed Loop Assay
Development (CLAD) protocol (Ventana Medical Systems),
antibody was optimized using the OmniMap DAB AntiRabbit (HRP) Detection Kit (Ventana Medical Systems).
Standard quality control procedures were undertaken to

optimize antigen retrieval, primary antibody dilution, secondary antibody detection and other factors for both "signal
and noise."
Statistical analysis
Age and gender differences were evaluated with the Student
t test and Fisher exact test. Because the urinary netrin-1
measurements do not closely follow a normal distribution
(assessed by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov goodness-of-ﬁt test),
medians and interquartile ranges were used to summarize the
tumor patient data, and controls were compared using the
nonparametric Mann–Whitney U test. Diagnostic accuracy
was assessed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve analysis, and the Youden Index was used to identify
cut-off values.

Results
Exogenous netrin-1 stimulates medulloblastoma cell
invasiveness and activates MAPK
Transwell invasion assays were carried out in four human
medulloblastoma cell lines: D283, D425, D458, and D556.
Netrin-1 stimulated their invasiveness in a dose-dependent

ﬁelds. B, VEGF-A was analyzed on the same medulloblastoma cell lines. C, for proliferation, medulloblastoma cells (2.5  10 ) were cultured in serum reduced
medium (0.5% FBS) in the absence or presence of netrin-1. Cell number was counted at 24 and 48 hours. Data represent the mean  SD (n ¼ 3).  , P < 0.05.

manner by 16 hours (Fig. 1A). Netrin-1 also stimulated the
invasiveness of endothelial cells derived from the mouse
brain (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, VEGF-A, an angiogenic
factor, did not affect these medulloblastoma cell lines,
even at a high concentration (50 ng/mL); however it did
stimulate mouse brain endothelial cells invasion as a positive control (Fig. 1B). These VEGF-A results could be
accounted for by lack of VEGFR2 expression in medulloblastoma cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Thus, netrin-1
might be an advantageous therapeutic target because it

stimulates both medulloblastoma and endothelial cells invasiveness, whereas VEGF-A stimulates only endothelial cells
invasiveness.
Netrin-1 stimulated Erk phosphorylation in D458 cells and
brain endothelial cells in a time-course–dependent manner
(Supplementary Fig. S1B), consistent with our previous results
that netrin-1 induced Erk phosphorylation in glioblastoma
cells (6). VEGF-A did not stimulate Erk phosphorylation in
medulloblastoma cells, but did in brain endothelial cells (Supplementary Fig. S1C).

Figure 2. Inhibition of netrin-1 blocks medulloblastoma cell invasion and Erk phosphorylation. A, medulloblastoma cells were treated with netrin-1
neutralizing antibody (20 mg/mL, for 120 minutes) or U0126 (10 mmol/L, for 30 minutes) before cell lysate collection. Cell lysates were analyzed by
Western blot analysis. B, D458 cells were incubated with MEK inhibitor (U0126, 10 mmol/L) or CatB inhibitor (CA074, 10 mmol/L) and cell invasiveness
was assessed with Matrigel-coated Transwells. C, D458 cells were transfected with control or netrin-1–speciﬁc siRNA (#1 and #2; 20 nmol/L).
After 24 hours, the silencing effect of netrin-1 siRNA on netrin-1 protein levels was analyzed by Western blot analysis. The intensity of netrin-1
bands was normalized to their respective b-actin controls. Numbers below gel lanes represent the fold-change in intensity relative to controls. D,
medulloblastoma cells were transfected by netrin-1 siRNA and invasion assay was performed. Data represent the mean  SD (n ¼ 3).  , P < 0.05.
E, medulloblastoma cells were incubated with control IgG or netrin-1 neutralizing antibody (20 mg/mL). Cell invasiveness was assessed via Matrigelcoated Transwells. Data represent the mean  SD (n ¼ 3).  , P < 0.05.

Medulloblastoma cell proliferation was analyzed in
response to netrin-1 treatment (Fig. 1C). Although invasiveness
in response to netrin-1 occurred at 16 hours, exogenous netrin1 had no effect on medulloblastoma cell proliferation even at 24

hours, with only minimal increases in proliferation in some
medulloblastoma cell lines at 48 hours. In addition, 200 ng/mL
of netrin-1 used in the invasion assays was insufﬁcient to
induce medulloblastoma cell proliferation at any time point

in the presence or absence of netrin-1 (200 ng/mL). D, mouse primary endothelial cells were transfected with control or neogenin siRNA and were
seeded on Matrigel-coated well plates in the presence or absence of netrin-1 (200 ng/mL). The number of tube junctions/ﬁeld was measured by
ImageJ software. Scale bar, 100 mm. E, Matrigel plugs, either left untreated or mixed with netrin-1 (16 mg/mL) in the presence or absence of neogenin-blocking
antibody (300 mg/mL), were implanted into CD1 mice. Matrigel plugs were removed and frozen sections were stained with anti-CD31 antibody. CD31
positive cells were measured using ImageJ software. Scale bar, 10 mm. Data represent the mean  SD (n ¼ 3).  , P < 0.05.

(Fig. 1C). Thus, it seems, in medulloblastoma cells, that invasion can be independent of proliferation.
Inhibition of endogenous netrin-1 decreases
medulloblastoma cell invasion
Endogenous netrin-1 secreted into conditioned medium
was measured by ELISA (Supplementary Fig. S1D). The
netrin-1 protein levels in the four medulloblastoma cell lines

www.aacrjournals.org

ranged from 20 to 110 pg/mL. Antibody speciﬁcity was
addressed by testing the ELISA with positive and negative
controls. We had previously prepared U87MG glioblastoma
cells overexpressing netrin-1 (6). As predicted, ELISA detected
abundant netrin-1 in conditioned media of netrin-1 transfectants (250 pg/mL), but none at all in the conditioned media of
parental U87MG cells (Supplementary Fig. S1D). To further
conﬁrm the reliability of the ELISA, all samples were re-tested

by an independent laboratory member on different dates with
new kits. There was high concordance of netrin-1 levels
between samples, supporting the reproducibility of the assay.
Netrin-1 stimulates glioblastoma cell invasion by activating
CatB, a cysteine protease, via the MAPK pathway (6). Netrin-1
neutralizing antibody suppressed Erk phosphorylation in four
medulloblastoma cell lines, as did U0126 treatment (Fig. 2A).
CatB protein expression was reduced in three of the medulloblastoma cell lines but not in D283 (Fig. 2A). MEK inhibitor
U0126 and CatB inhibitor CA074 inhibited netrin-1–induced
D458 cell invasion by 71% and 53%, respectively (Fig. 2B). When
cells were treated with two different siRNA constructs, both
reduced netrin-1 protein expression by >90% (Fig. 2C) and
medulloblastoma cell invasion by 56% to 74% (Fig. 2D). Netrin1 neutralizing antibody also inhibited medulloblastoma invasion (D293 by 55%, D425 by 62%, D458 by 56%, and D556 by
39%) compared with cells treated with control IgG (Fig. 2E).
These inhibition results suggest that netrin-1 secreted by
medulloblastoma cells stimulates medulloblastoma cell invasiveness by activating CatB via the MAPK pathway.
Netrin-1 increases medulloblastoma invasiveness
through UNC5B and neogenin
Netrin-1 has multiple receptors (7). Of these receptors,
neogenin and UNC5B expression levels seemed to be the

highest in all four medulloblastoma cell lines (Fig. 3A and
B). UNC5B and neogenin siRNA reduced protein expression by
about 80% or 65%, respectively, in D458 cells (Fig. 3C). Silencing
of UNC5B and neogenin blocked medulloblastoma cell invasion by 38% and 70%, respectively (Fig. 3D). There was no
additional effect on medulloblastoma cell invasion using a
combination of UNC5B and neogenin siRNA (Fig. 3D). Because
medulloblastoma cell lines express netrin-1 and neogenin, we
knocked down both proteins. Neogenin and netrin-1 siRNA
reduced protein expression by about 85% or 95%, respectively,
in D458 cells (Fig. 3E). The combination of neogenin and
netrin-1 siRNA strongly suppressed medulloblastoma cell
invasion (76%) compared with neogenin (52%) and netrin-1
(63%) knockdown alone (Fig. 3F). These results indicate that
the netrin-1/neogenin loop could be a target to repress the
invasive activity of medulloblastoma cells.
Netrin-1 mediates endothelial cells activity through
neogenin
Netrin-1–induced mouse brain capillary endothelial cells
invasion (Fig. 1A) as well as endothelial cells sprouting (Supplementary Fig. S2). Neogenin expression was highest among
the netrin-1 receptors in brain endothelial cells (Fig. 4A).

signiﬁcantly decreased netrin-1–induced endothelial cells
invasion by 40% (Fig. 4C) and tube formation by 50% (Fig.
4D). Furthermore, netrin-1 induced CD31-positive endothelial
cells inﬁltration into Matrigel, which was abrogated by neogenin neutralizing antibody by 90% (Fig. 4E). It seems that
netrin-1 has pro-angiogenic properties.
Netrin-1 is elevated in patients with human
medulloblastoma
Because netrin-1 might be aberrantly expressed in human
medulloblastoma tissue, we compared netrin-1 mRNA expression levels using pediatric tissue samples. RNA was extracted
from the medulloblastoma tumor of one patient, as indicated
by the red box, and normal adjacent cerebellum was obtained
from the same patient, as indicated by the blue box (Fig. 5A).

qPCR showed that netrin-1 mRNA expression in the medulloblastoma tumor was 1.7 times higher than in the normal
cerebellum tissue (n ¼ 1; Fig. 5B). Furthermore, netrin-1
expression in tumor samples from patients with medulloblastoma (n ¼ 5) and normal cerebellum (n ¼ 3)
were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Antibody
speciﬁcity in IHC was tested by Western blot analysis. The
antibody detected netrin-1 but not chicken netrin-2 (similar
to human netrin-3) or human netrin-4 proteins (Fig. 5C).
Although IHC staining showed minimal netrin-1 expression
in normal cerebellum (n ¼ 3), netrin-1 was expressed in the
majority of medulloblastoma cells (n ¼ 5; Fig. 5D). Quantiﬁcation revealed a marked increase of netrin-1 expression
in medulloblastoma tissue (93% in medulloblastoma vs. 13%
in control, P < 0.0001; Fig. 5E).

Measurement of urinary netrin-1 levels demonstrates
clinical utility as a biomarker
Recent studies from our laboratory demonstrated that
urinary biomarkers such as MMP-2, MMP-9, and VEGF predicted brain tumor presence or response to therapy (17). Given
that netrin-1 is a secreted protein, we hypothesized that we
might detect netrin-1 from patient urinary samples. There
were no signiﬁcant age or gender differences between the 16
patients with medulloblastoma and 12 controls (age, P ¼ 0.48
and gender, P ¼ 0.92). Median (interquartile ranges) urinary
netrin-1 levels were 0.5 pg/mg for controls and 4.8 pg/mg for
patients with medulloblastoma (P < 0.001), suggesting that
urinary netrin-1 levels are elevated in patients with medulloblastoma (Fig. 6A).
We compared urinary netrin-1 levels between invasive
phenotypes (local recurrence and/or dissemination) and
noninvasive, non-disseminated tumors. As described
in Table 1, the phenotype of the invasive tumor was deﬁned
as the presence of either a high-risk patient (age <3 years,
subtotal resection with >1.5 cm residual tumor, Mþ with
leptomeningeal seeding or location outside of posterior
fossa) or an Mþ positive patient as deﬁned by a Modiﬁed
Chang Staging (M1–M4, but not M0; refs. 2 and 19–22).
Patients with invasive tumors (high risk: 8.3 pg/mg, n ¼ 7)
had urinary netrin-1 levels approximately ﬁve times greater
than patients with noninvasive tumors (low risk: 1.6 pg/mg,
n ¼ 7, P ¼ 0.002; Fig. 6B). In a single patient case (shown as
proof-of-principle), urinary netrin-1 levels were elevated at
presentation (Fig. 6C, a) at 13 pg/mg, and then markedly
decreased at 8 weeks postoperatively to 0.8 pg/mg (Fig. 6C, c),
correlated with an MRI showing no evident residual tumor
(Fig. 6C, b). Taken together, urinary netrin-1 levels correlate

with invasive/disseminated phenotype and drop following
surgical resection.
Urinary netrin-1 levels as predictive biomarkers of
medulloblastoma
ROC curve analysis indicated that urinary netrin-1 provided excellent diagnostic accuracy as a predictive biomarker in differentiating between tumor and control groups [area
under the curve (AUC): 0.875, P < 0.001]. The Youden Index
revealed that the optimal cut-off value is >2.3 pg/mg, which
translates into 81.3% sensitivity. Multivariable logistic
regression indicated that the odds of medulloblastoma were
estimated to be over 12 times greater for patients with
urinary netrin-1 levels over 2.3 pg/mg (odds ratio: 12.6;
95% conﬁdence interval, 2.1–47.5; P ¼ 0.002; Fig. 6D).

Discussion
We analyzed four different human medulloblastoma cell
lines (D238, D425, D458, and D556) for reproducibility. Exogenous addition of netrin-1 increased medulloblastoma cell
invasion in a dose-dependent manner. All four medulloblastoma cell lines secreted netrin-1. Blocking endogenous netrin-1
by neutralizing antibody and siRNA inhibited medulloblastoma invasiveness by 70%; however, administration of the angiogenic factor VEGF-A did not stimulate medulloblastoma invasiveness, because of lack of VEGFR2. Thus, unlike VEGF-A,
netrin-1 has a dual role in promoting medulloblastoma invasiveness and endothelial cells activity.
Previous work in glioblastoma cell lines revealed that
netrin-1 administration results in receptor-mediated regulation of intracellular phosphorylation of kinases. This subsequently regulates the expression of CatB, a protease, and
that blockade of CatB results in the abrogation of netrin-1–
mediated invasion (6). Netrin-1 administered to medulloblastoma cells promotes the phosphorylation of Erk1/2, and
this increase of p-Erk1/2 correlates with increased invasion.
Blockade of Erk1/2 phosphorylation with a pharmacologic
inhibitor (U0126) resulted in loss of netrin-1–induced invasion. In a similar fashion, pharmacologic blockade of CatB
resulted in loss of invasion. Taken together, these data reveal
that netrin-1 induces the phosphorylation of Erk1/2, which
is followed by CatB synthesis and release, promoting medulloblastoma invasion.
Seven netrin receptors have been reported (7). Of these
receptors, UNC5B and neogenin seem to be the most predominant in all four medulloblastoma cell lines. As with
netrin-1, inhibiting neogenin and UNC5B protein expression
by respective siRNAs suppressed medulloblastoma cell invasion in vitro, revealing that netrin-1 exerts its invasive effects
by interacting speciﬁcally with these receptors. When
paired, there was a slight synergy between the two receptors.
These results demonstrate a novel role for the neogenin and
UNC5B receptors in medulloblastoma invasion, with the
identiﬁcation of key mechanism checkpoints.
Netrin-1 increased medulloblastoma invasiveness at 16
hours. On the other hand, netrin-1 did not facilitate medulloblastoma cell proliferation at 24 hours, but did slightly increase
proliferation in some medulloblastoma cell lines by 48 hours.

Netrin-1 Induces Medulloblastoma Invasion and Angiogenesis

Moreover, 200 ng/mL of netrin-1 induced medulloblastoma
invasion, whereas it was necessary for at least 800 ng/mL to
induce medulloblastoma proliferation. These results demonstrate marked temporal distinctions between invasion and
proliferation activities by netrin-1; however, we cannot exclude
that netrin-1 also stimulates proliferation and is multifunctional to some degree.
Netrin-1 has pro-angiogenic properties. It stimulated endothelial cells invasion, tube formation, sprouting from endothelial cells spheroids in vitro and the recruitment of invasive
endothelial cells into Matrigel plugs in mice. Blocking neogenin
with a neutralizing antibody completely blocked endothelial
cells inﬁltration into Matrigel in vivo. Netrin-1 stimulates
angiogenesis in other systems, such as murine ischemic hindlimb model and the corneal micropocket assay (23, 24). On the
other hand, netrin-1 inhibits angiogenesis through UNC5B in
mice or in zebraﬁsh models (25, 26). This disparity could be
because of the presence of bifunctional receptors, with some
mediating repulsion (UNC5A–D) and others, attraction (DCC,
neogenin, and DSCAM).
Clinical medulloblastoma tumor samples have signiﬁcantly
increased netrin-1 mRNA levels (1.7-fold). Protein levels of
netrin-1 in medulloblastoma are elevated by 5- to 10-fold
compared with normal cerebellum. Netrin-1 is a secreted
protein; thus, urine could be a source of netrin-1 as a noninvasive biomarker, suitable for ELISA, which can be used to
predict medulloblastoma tumor status. Urine collection is a
cost-efﬁcient method that carries no risk. We obtained urine
samples from children with pathology-proven medulloblastoma. Quantiﬁcation of urinary netrin-1 revealed signiﬁcant
elevations (9-fold) in samples from children with medulloblastoma (4.8 pg/mg) as compared with healthy matched controls
(0.5 pg/mg). Patient tumors that manifested an invasive phenotype had increased levels of urinary netrin-1 (high risk: 8.3
pg/mg; low risk: 1.6 pg/mg), linking netrin-1 expression to tumor
invasion and dissemination. Importantly, tumor resection
resulted in a strong drop in urinary netrin-1 levels (pre-op:
13 pg/mg; post-op: 0.8 pg/mg), implicating the medulloblastoma
tumor as the source of netrin-1 in the urine. In addition to the
patient in Fig. 6C, a second patient demonstrated similar
results when tested 2 years after surgery (pre-op: 2.6 pg/mg;
post-op: 0.5 pg/mg), consistent with clinical cure. A notable
weakness of this study is the small sample size. Although the
data achieve statistical signiﬁcance, it is obvious that there is
variability in netrin-1 urinary levels. One objective of subsequent studies would be to expand this proof-of-principle series

of experiments to include a larger sample size, including a
greater number of controls.
In summary, our data implicate netrin-1 as a potent
inducer of medulloblastoma invasiveness, acting via neogenin and UNC5B. These in vitro results are compatible with
clinical studies of patients with medulloblastoma showing
signiﬁcant elevations of netrin-1 in tumor samples. Together, these clinical studies suggest a novel application of
netrin-1 as a noninvasive biomarker, with statistically signiﬁcant correlations between netrin-1 levels and tumor
status that could distinguish invasive and noninvasive
medulloblastoma and predict whether an medulloblastoma
tumor is responding to therapy.
