Abstract
Genomic alterations targeting the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) gene
have been strongly associated with cancer pathogenesis. The clinical effectiveness of
EGFR targeted therapies, including small molecules directed against the kinase domain
such as gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib, have been proven successful in treating nonsmall cell lung cancer patients with tumors harboring EGFR kinase domain mutations.
Recent large-scale genomic studies in glioblastoma and lung cancer have identified an
additional class of oncogenic mutations caused by the intragenic deletion of carboxyterminal coding regions. Here, we report that combinations of exonic deletions of exon
25 to 28 lead to the oncogenic activation of EGF receptor in the absence of ligand and
consequent cellular transformation, indicating a significant role of C-terminal domain
in modulating EGFR activation. Furthermore, we show that the oncogenic activity of
the resulting C-terminal deletion mutants are efficiently inhibited by EGFR-targeted
drugs including erlotinib, afatinib, dacomitinib as well as cetuximab, expanding the
therapeutic rationale of cancer genome-based EGFR targeted approaches. Finally,
in vivo and in vitro preclinical studies demonstrate that constitutive asymmetric
dimerization in mutant EGFR is a key mechanism for oncogenic activation and
tumorigenesis by C-terminal deletion mutants. Therefore, our data provide compelling
evidence for oncogenic activation of C-terminal deletion mutants at the molecular
level and we propose that C-terminal deletion status of EGFR can be considered as a
potential genomic marker for EGFR-targeted therapy.

INTRODUCTION

for altered EGFR regulation and cellular transformation
[3, 4]. In lung adenocarcinoma, the most frequent somatic
mutations occur within the kinase domain of EGFR,
including L858R in exon 21 and small in-frame deletions
in exon 19 [5, 6]. Importantly, these two particular somatic
mutations are associated with a clinical response to the
small molecule EGFR kinase inhibitors, such as gefitinib,
erlotinib, and afatinib [7-11]. In contrast, EGFR alterations
identified in GBM include intragenic deletions targeting

Aberrant activation of Epidermal Growth Factor
Receptor (EGFR), a member of the ErbB family
of receptor tyrosine kinases, plays a central role in
development and progression of cancer [1, 2]. Different
classes of genomic alterations involving EGFR
identified in cancer, including lung adenocarcinoma and
glioblastoma (GBM), have been shown to be responsible

harboring multiple or single exon deletions within
exon 25 to 28, thereby expressing 10 different EGFR
C-terminal deletion variants. Subsequently, we examined
the functional consequence of these deletions in
regulating oncogenic activation of EGFR and sensitivity
to EGFR targeted drugs. In particular, we sought to
address whether asymmetric dimerization is required
for cellular transformation through activation of GBM
and lung cancer-derived oncogenic C-terminal deletion
mutants. Our in vivo and in vitro preclinical studies
demonstrate that C-terminal exonic deletion mutants are
oncogenically active in the absence of ligand and sensitive
to EGFR targeted therapies, and more importantly, that
their oncogenic potential depends on the asymmetric
dimerization of kinase domain.

exons 2 to 7 deletion (known as EGFR vIII), exons 14
to 15 (known as EGFRvII) and somatic mutations within
the extracellular domain of EGFR, but kinase domain
mutations are relatively rare [12-16]. Despite in vitro
experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of small
molecule inhibitors on GBM-specific oncogenic EGFR
variants, they have not yielded consistent responses in
GBM patients harboring such mutations [17, 18].
Recent large-scale genomic analyses identified
intragenic deletion mutations within the EGFR carboxyterminal domain in GBM and lung adenocarcinoma
[16, 19-21]. Subsequent studies have shown that the
resulting C-terminal truncation variants of EGFR have
oncogenic potential to promote cellular transformation
and tumorigenesis [16, 19, 21, 22]. Importantly, FDAapproved EGFR targeted drugs including erlotinib, and
cetuximab, a humanized anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody,
effectively inhibit the oncogenic activation of C-terminal
deletion EGFR mutants, demonstrating that both drugs
may be promising therapeutic agents in treating cancer
patients harboring such deletion mutations [19, 23]. The
second generation EGFR kinase inhibitors, such as FDAapproved afatinib and dacomitnib, which is currently in
phase III trial, are being actively investigated as they have
demonstrated better efficacy than erlotinib and shown to
overcome EGFR gatekeeper mutation, T790M [24-26].
However, their efficacies against C-terminal deletion
EGFR mutants have not been investigated yet.
Three-dimensional structural analysis of EGFR has
revealed the importance of ligand-induced asymmetric
dimerization mediated by the N-lobe and the C-lobe of
the EGFR kinase domain in receptor activation [27-29].
This finding was further supported by functional evidence
that disruption of asymmetric dimerization through
substitution mutations at the dimerization interface, such
as L704N (receiver-impairing mutation) in the N-lobe
and I941R (activator-impairing mutation) in the C-lobe,
impair ligand-induced EGFR activation and consequent
cellular transformation [30]. Mouse tumors induced
by dimerization-dependent L858R and G719S mutants
respond dramatically to cetuximab, whereas tumors
driven by dimerization-independent mutant exon 20
insertion mutant are resistant. Therefore, it was proposed
that EGFR mutation status may be a predictive factor of
clinical response to cetuximab as a close correlation exists
between dimerization dependency and its pharmacological
effects [30, 31].
Several genomic rearrangements leading to
oncogenic C-terminal deletion mutant EGFR have been
identified in cancer, however the molecular mechanisms
mediating cellular transformation by these oncogenic
mutants is unknown. For a comprehensive assessment
of their biological role and clinical applications, we
characterized a complete panel of both previously
identified as well as not yet discovered EGFR C-terminal
deletion mutations by establishing stable cell lines

RESULTS
EGFR CTED mutants have transformation
potential
In order to systemically characterize the oncogenic
potential of C-terminal deletion (CTED) mutants, we
generated a series of EGFR expression constructs encoding
the 10 possible combinations of exon 25 to 28 deletions as
shown in Figure 1A. The resulting EGFR deletion variants
can be classified into 3 different subgroups (see the figure
legends for detail); 1) out-of-frame deletion mutants
lacking exon 25-28, exon 26-28, exon 27-28 or exon
28 (designated CTED1, CTED3, CTED6, and CTED7,
respectively) with intron-encoded stop codon, 2) out-offrame deletion mutants lacking exon 25-27 or exon 2627 or exon 27 (designated CTED2, CTED4, and CTED5,
respectively) with premature stop codon in subsequent
exon and 3) in-frame deletion mutants lacking exon 25 or
exon 25-26 or exon 26 (designated CTED8, CTED9, and
CTED10, respectively). These deletion variants as well
as wild-type (WT) EGFR were stably expressed in NIH3T3 cells and the oncogenic phenotype of the resulting
cell lines was assessed through anchorage-independent
growth in soft agar. The oncogenic activity of cancerderived CTED2, CTED5, and CTED8 mutants have been
previously established and serve as positive controls in
this study [19, 22].
NIH-3T3 cells expressing WT EGFR formed
colonies in soft agar only upon the addition of EGF, while
the CTED mutants, with the exception of CTED1 and
CTED10, formed colonies in the absence of EGF (Fig.
1B). These results indicate that the deletion of exon 26
(1039-1054 aa) alone was not sufficient to induce cellular
transformation of NIH-3T3 cells. In agreement with a
previous report [22], we also noted a correlation between
the deleted length of the C-terminal domain and the degree
of transformation, suggesting that a minimal length or

region is necessary to provide a growth advantage.
Taken together, these findings demonstrate that in
addition to the previously characterized CTED1, CTED2,
CTED5 and CTED8 mutants found in GBM and lung
cancer, other EGFR truncated mutants produced by
different intragenic deletions of C-terminal domain are
able to induce cellular transformation in NIH-3T3 cells.

Next, we examined tyrosine phosphorylation on
mutant EGFR as well as downstream signaling molecules
including Stat3 and Akt to investigate whether cellular

transformation induced by the EGFR CTED mutants is
associated with ligand-independent activation of receptor.
NIH3T3 cells have low endogenous levels of EGFR so
phosphorylation signal represents exogenous mutants only.
While tyrosine phosphorylation of WT EGFR was detected
only upon EGF stimulation, CTED8 and CTED9 in-frame
deletion mutants were constitutively phosphorylated and
enzymatically active in the absence of EGF as evidenced
by downstream phosphorylation of Stat3 (Fig. 1C). The
phosphorylation status of CTED1 to CTED7 mutants was
not readily detectable due to the absence of the tyrosine
residues, however by using Stat3 and Akt as readouts,
we observed constitutive activation of all mutants but
CTED1 and CTED10, consistent with the absence of
colonies in soft agar (Fig. 1C). In line with the varying
oncogenic ability observed in the soft agar assay, although
CTED2 to CTED7 mutants were constitutively activated,
they exhibited varying ability to activate downstream
molecules, as demonstrated by different extent of Akt
phosphorylation. Overall, we found that the CTED2 to
CTED9 mutants are oncogenic and consequently able

to induce activation of downstream signaling pathways
including Stat3 and Akt. These data are consistent with
previous reports that C-terminal truncated mutants retain
ability to transduce signal [22, 32, 33].

EGFR CTED mutants exhibit sensitivity to EGFR
inhibitors in vitro and in vivo
Previous studies have shown that the oncogenic
activity of cancer-derived CTED2, CTED5 and CTED8
mutants was effectively suppressed by the EGFR inhibitors
erlotinib or cetuximab both in vitro and in vivo [19, 21]. To
further investigate the clinical utility of these anti-EGFR
drugs, we profiled the panel of CTED mutants. First, Ba/F3
cells were transformed through constitutive expression
of all CTED mutants leading to IL-3 independence while
parental Ba/F3 cells failed to grow [34]. Of note, unlike
the NIH-3T3 cells, ectopic expression of both CTED1
and CTED10 mutants were able to transform Ba/F3 cells
(Fig. S1A). These data further confirmed the transforming

by CTED1 to CTED10 mutants was suppressed by either cetuximab (A), erlotinib (B), dacomitinib (C), or afatinib (D). Ba/F3 cells
transformed by indicated CTED mutants were treated with the four EGFR inhibitors at the concentrations indicated for 72 hours and
assayed for cell viability using Cell Counting Kit-8 reagents. Parental and Ba/F3 cells carrying the L858R mutant of EGFR were used as
controls. The results are presented as a mean ±SD of sextuplicate wells and are representative of three independent experiments. Asterisk

potential of CTED mutants in a second cell line system.
The difference of transforming ability of the CTED1
and CTED10 mutants in two cell lines is unclear, but we
hypothesize that differential EGFR expression may be
responsible for the observed discrepancy.
The CTED mutant transformed Ba/F3 cells were
then tested for sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors, including
cetuximab and erlotinib, as well as second generation
irreversible EGFR/ERBB2 dual inhibitors afatinib
and dacomitinib . All EGFR-targeted drugs effectively
suppressed the growth of Ba/F3 cells expressing CTED
mutants in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 2). The
sensitivity of CTED2, CTED5 and CTED8 expressing
cells to erlotinib is comparable with our previous report
[19, 21]. In contrast, the same drugs showed no inhibitory
effects on the parental Ba/F3 cells. In addition, we
observed that the second generation EGFR inhibitors
afatinib and dacomitinib were more potent, 100-fold and
10-fold respectively, at suppressing the growth of CTED
mutants compared to the reversible inhibitor, erlotinib [25,
35]. Intriguingly, we found that cells expressing GBM-

derived CTED1 mutant exhibited the highest sensitivity
to three of the EGFR inhibitors (afatinib, dacomitinib,
and cetuximab) whereas cells expressing GBM-derived
CTED5 mutant exhibited the lowest sensitivity in two
of the tested inhibitors (afatinib and dacomitinib).
Other CTED mutants remained close to the mean IC50
values, which were ~0.237μg/ml, ~257.4nM, ~6.18nM,
and ~19.9nM, for cetuximab, erlotinib, afatinib, and
dacomitinib, respectively. Of note, we observed that lung
cancer-derived L858R mutant responded more sensitively
to erlotinib and afatinib than CTED mutants, but exhibited
similar sensitivity to cetuximab and dacomitinib.
Consistent with this result, these four drugs decreased
constitutive phosphorylation of Stat5 and Akt in patientderived CTED transformed Ba/F3 cells, but not in parental
Ba/F3 cells, suggesting that the oncogenic activity of
CTED mutants are specifically targeted and inhibited by
these drugs (Fig. S1B-E).
To further explore the therapeutic efficacy of
cetuximab, erlotinib, and afatinib in vivo, we expanded
our studies to subcutaneous xenografts of NIH-3T3 cells

Figure 3: EGFR CTED mutant induced tumorigenesis is suppressed by either erlotinib, afatinib, or cetuximab. (A) The

images are representative of tumor resection from xenografted mice injected with NIH-3T3 cells expressing CTED5, CTED8, or CTED4
following approximately 5 weeks of EGFR inhibitors or PBS treatment. (B) The growth of mouse tumors driven by CTED5, CTED8, and
CTED4 mutants was significantly suppressed by erlotinib, afatinib, or cetuximab. Fourteen days after cell injection, when tumors reached
50 to 70 mm3 in size, erlotinib, afatinib (50mg/kg, gavage), or cetuximab (50mg/kg, IP) was administered 3 times per week for 5 weeks.

length and width, respectively (n=12 for each treatment group, mean ± SD). IP, intraperitoneal. (C) Lysates prepared from the untreated
or cetuximab, erlotinib, afatinib, or dacomitinib treated xenograft tumors were subjected to immunoblotting with total or phospho-specific

Oncogenic potential of EGFR CTED mutants
depends on asymmetric dimerization

stably expressing CTED4, CTED5 and CTED8 mutants.
We chose CTED5 and CTED8 as a representative of
various patient-derived oncogenic CTED mutants and
CTED4 as a representative of hypothetical, or yet to be
discovered CTED mutants. In line with our previous
report [19], we found that treatment of the EGFR-targeted
drugs dramatically suppressed tumor formation driven by
CTED4, CTED5, and CTED8 as compared to PBS control
(Fig. 3A and 3B). Furthermore, in line with in vitro results,
constitutive phosphorylation of Stat3, but not Akt, was
robustly diminished in the tumors treated with all tested
drugs (Fig. 3C). These results demonstrate that in addition
to the GBM and lung cancer-derived CTED 5 and CTED8
mutants, CTED4 mutant is also tumorigenic and that
tumors derived from these mutants exhibit a significant
response to cetuximab, erlotinib and afatinib.

A subset of EGFR mutants, including L858R,
G719S and G724S undergo constitutive asymmetric
dimerization of the kinase domain contributing to
the oncogenic activation of mutant EGFR [30, 31],
demonstrating that dimer formation is an essential
step required for cell proliferation by ErbB family
members [36]. We sought to determine whether the same
asymmetric dimerization-dependent activation mechanism
is responsible for the oncogenic activity and consequent
cellular transformation by the CTED mutants. EGFR
expression constructs that combined receiver-impairing
mutations (L704N or L760R) or activator-impairing
mutations (I941R or M952R) with oncogenic CTED4,
CTED5, and CTED8 mutants were stably expressed in
NIH-3T3 cells and assayed for their ability to grow in soft
agar. The transforming ability of dimerization-dependent

mutants is predicted to be abolished by introduction of cis
mutation of L704N, L760R, I941R, or M952R in CTED
mutant [30, 31].
We found that introduction of dimerizationimpairing mutations into CTED4, CTED5 and CTED8
mutants led to substantial decreases in soft agar colony
formation (Fig. 4A), demonstrating that these mutants
are dependent on asymmetric dimerization for their
oncogenic potential. These results are similar with
what has been reported for the dimerization-dependent
L858R, G719S and G724S mutants [30, 31]. Next, we
assessed the biochemical consequences of disrupting
asymmetric dimerization in oncogenic CTED mutants
by studying the phosphorylation patterns of EGFR
directly for CTED8 or indirectly for CTED4 and CTED5

through downstream signaling molecules (Fig. 4B-D).
As suggested by the results of colony formation assay,
no detectable EGFR, Stat3 and Akt phosphorylation was
observed in all dimerization-impaired cis mutants of
CTED4, CTED5 or CTED8. EGF treatment was not able
to restore phosphorylation in these dimerization-impaired
mutants, further confirming that the oncogenic activity of
CTED4, CTED5 or CTED8 mutants require asymmetric
dimerization.
To investigate the requirement of asymmetric
dimerization in tumorigenesis by CTED4, CTED5 and
CTED8 mutants, NIH-3T3 cells stably expressing these
mutants alone or in parallel with dimerization-impaired
I941R or L704N cis mutants were xenografted into
mice. The size of mouse tumors driven by CTED4,

with or without receiver mutation (I941R) or activator mutation (L704N). (B) The growth of mouse tumors driven by CTED4, CTED5, and
CTED8 mutants were significantly suppressed by dimerization impairing L704N and I941R mutations. Tumor size was measured 3 times
per week, and the volume was determined according to the formula V=ab2/2, where a and b were tumor length and width, respectively (n=9
for each mutant group, mean ± SD). (C) Lysates prepared from the xenograft tumors harboring CTED mutants with or without dimerization

sequencing of EGFR C-terminal coding regions would
be informative in genome-based patient selection for
which administrating FDA-approved EGFR TKIs and
cetuximab may be clinically beneficial. According to the
recent large scale GBM genomic study [16], C-terminal
rearrangements (namely CTED 2, 5, and 8) were detected
at about 9% of GBM patients. However, since loss of
C-terminus yields not mappable transcript, the authors
postulate that EGFR CTED mutations are potentially
more frequent than understood. Considering that we have
provided pharmacologic evidence for uncharacterized
CTED mutants as well, we think even larger proportion
of patients with GBM or lung cancer may benefit from
EGFR targeted therapies than what is predicted. Also, we
speculate that combining antibodies and kinase inhibitors
may bring synergistic effect in these patients, as dual
EGFR inhibition has proven successful in several types
of cancer [47].
Recently, we reported that dimerization-dependent
L858R and G724S mutants were sensitive to cetuximab,
whereas tumors driven by dimerization-independent
mutants such as T790M were resistant, suggesting a
close correlation between dimerization dependency
and the pharmacological effects of cetuximab [30, 31].
Importantly, our finding that cetuximab is highly effective
against dimerization-dependent CTED mutants, provides
additional compelling evidence of our previously proposed
hypothesis that disruption of dimerization may be among
the antitumor mechanisms of cetuximab. Therefore,
we propose that blockage of constitutive dimerization
of C-terminal exonic deletion mutants with cetuximab
may be an effective novel therapeutic strategy to treat a
subset of cancer patients, along with patients harboring
dimerization-dependent L858R and G724S oncogenic
EGFR mutants.
Ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation on specific
residues within C-terminal domain of EGFR is essential
for mediating activation of signaling pathways and cellular
transformation [48, 49]. However, previous reports have
demonstrated that C-terminal truncated EGFR mutant
retains signal transduction [22, 32, 50] and our functional
and biochemical data also clearly demonstrate that
C-terminal phosphorylation is not required for oncogenic
transformation by mutant EGFR as mutant forms of
EGFR were able to induce tumors in the absence of
autophosphorylation. Consistent with our results, EGFR
exon 19 deletion mutant was shown to retain its oncogenic
activity in the absence of the C-terminal domain or
autophosphorylation [33, 51]. Given that oncogenic
CTED mutants including CTED1 to CTED7 were still
able to activate the major signaling pathways including
Akt and Stats in the absence of autophosphorylation in
our in vitro models, we believe that Akt and/or Stats
may play a crucial role in cellular transformation by
these mutants. Interestingly, we observed that the level
of constitutive phospho-Stat3, but not phospho-Akt, was

CTED5, or CTED8 mutants were significantly smaller
in dimerization-disrupted L704N or I941R tumors (Fig.
5A and 5B). In line with these results, immunoblotting
analysis revealed that constitutive phosphorylation of
Akt and Stat3 was diminished in tumors driven by the
dimerization-impaired CTED mutants (Fig. 5C).
Taken together with in vivo and in vitro results,
we concluded that asymmetric dimerization of mutant
receptor is required for oncogenic activation and
consequent tumorigenesis by CTED mutants and that
the acquired ability of forming constitutive dimerization,
perhaps by C-terminal domain deletion, may be a key
driving mechanisms of oncogenic activation of these
variants.

DISCUSSION
Our data provide mechanistic insights into the
activation of 10 different C-terminal deletion variants
including GBM and lung cancer-derived EGFR mutants.
In vitro transformation experiments and in vivo xenograft
studies indicate that constitutive asymmetric dimerization
is a crucial mechanism of their oncogenic activation and
consequent cellular transformation. We hypothesize that
the ligand-independent asymmetric dimerization may be
induced and/or favored by increased local concentration
of mutant EGFR on the cell surface due to the impaired
receptor internalization/degradation as shown in the
previous studies [28, 37, 38], since C-terminal serves
as a docking site for proteins involved in EGFR
trafficking, such as CBL, MIG6, BRK/PTK6, and RAK
[39]. In support of this hypothesis, we observed that the
expression level of CTED mutants (CTED1 to CTED7)
lacking autophosphorylation sites were higher than that
of WT, CTED8, CTED9 and CTED10 mutants retaining
Y1069, Y1092, and Y1110 residues that are known to
either directly interact with Cbl sorting the EGFR to
lysosome degradation, or indirectly via Grb2 to initiate
ubiquitination upon activation [40]. These results are in
agreement with previous reports showing that Grb2 does
not co-precipitate in C-terminal truncated EGFR [33] and
that C-terminal deletion mutants fail to internalize [37,
38, 41, 42]. However, our data do not exclude another
possibility that truncated C-terminal domain of EGFR
may directly or indirectly induce constitutive asymmetric
dimerization in the absence of ligand by lowering the
threshold of functional receptor dimerization [43-46].
Genomic characterization of cancers combined
with chemical and immunological innovations have
led to the development of multiple genome-guided
targeted cancer therapies. The effective utilization and
deployment of these therapies, however, is still in its
infancy, as the interplay of mutation type, biochemical
potency, oncogenic mechanism and clinical efficacy
have not yet been fully elucidated. On the basis of our
preclinical studies, we propose that a prospective targeted

dramatically decreased in the tumors that responded to
treatment with all EGFR targeted drugs tested, suggesting
that Stat3 may be a key signaling protein for C-terminal
deletion mutant-driven tumorigenesis. This result coincide
well with the report of Pines et al in which unsupervised
examination of the phosphoproteome revealed that
CTED8 activate Stat3 to a greater extent compared
to WT-EGFR [22]. In addition, previous reports have
demonstrated that C-terminal truncated mutants, but not
WT EGFR, increase Src phosphorylation as well [22, 33].
Together with these data, our results lend support to the
hypothesis that C-terminal truncated mutants may activate
different downstream signaling pathways as they may
have altered specificity for target proteins [50]. However,
a detailed molecular mechanism underlying C-terminal
phosphorylation-independent cellular transformation and
downstream signaling activation by CTED mutants needs
to be further characterized.
In addition, we observed that EGFR phosphorylation
did not influence the oncogenic activity or EGFR targeted
drug sensitivity, in which the IC50 values of different
CTED mutants remained close in range irrespective of
the presence or absence of autophosphorylation on the
receptor. Also, we did not find any correlation between
pharmacological effects with EGFR inhibitors and the
length of C-terminal domain truncation in CTED mutants.
In future studies, it will be informative to identify any
common region or crucial motif within C-terminal
domain responsible for oncogenic activation and/or drug
sensitivity by more refined biochemical and functional
approaches.
In summary, we demonstrated that truncation of
EGFR C-terminal domain by intragenic deletion is a key
oncogenic driving events in tumorigenesis. In addition, we
showed that ligand-independent asymmetric dimerization
is a potential mechanism for oncogenic transformation by
these mutants. Finally, our findings will provide a rationale
to develop a new class of drug to disrupt asymmetric
dimerization, which would be potent to treat a subset
of cancer patients harboring dimerization-dependent
oncogenic EGFR mutants including C-terminal deletion
mutants.

fragments were annealed and amplified by the second
round of PCR reaction. Then, the EGFR exonic deletion
DNA fragments were subcloned into the pBabe wild-type
EGFR plasmid vector, pre-cleaved with the restriction
enzymes BglII and SalI. All plasmids were confirmed by
sequencing.

Cell culture and generation of cell lines by viral
transduction
All EGFR CTED mutant expressing cell lines (Ba/F3
and NIH-3T3 cells) used in the study were established by
retroviral infections, pooled and maintained as previously
described [19, 30]. For EGFR stimulation experiments,
cells were serum-starved for 18 hours followed by EGF
(Biosource) treatment (50ng/mL) for 5 minutes before
harvesting.

Anchorage-independent growth assay in soft agar
Soft agar assays were performed in triplicate as
previously described [52] with minor changes (3×104 cells
per well). Digital images were taken and the number of
colonies were quantified after 3 weeks using GelCount
software (Oxford) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The data represent triplicate wells. Each assay
was repeated a minimum of two times with comparable
results.

Cell growth inhibition assay
For growth inhibition assays, Ba/F3 cells were
seeded at a density of 1×104 cells per well in 96-well
plates (Corning). Twenty-four hours after plating, cells
were treated with either cetuximab (MERCK Serono),
erlotinib (LC laboratories), afatinib (LC laboratories), or
dacomitinib (Selleckchem) at the indicated concentrations
and incubated for another 72 hours. Viable cell numbers
were measured using Cell Counting Kit-8 solution
(Dojindo). Data are expressed as percentage of growth
relative to that of untreated control cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Immunoblotting and antibodies

Expression constructs

Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer supplemented
with protease inhibitors (Roche) and phosphatase
inhibitors (Thermo Scientific). Whole-cell lysates were
then separated using 6% or 8% SDS-PAGE followed by
transferring to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane
was probed with the antibodies against either N-terminal
epitope EGFR (Thermo Scientific), C-terminal epitope
EGFR (Bethyl), 4G10 (Millipore), β-actin, Stat3,
p-Stat3, Akt, p-Akt, p-Stat5 or p-Shc (Cell Signaling
Technology). Then, the blot was incubated overnight at

Various pBabe-puro expression constructs encoding
CTED1 to CTED10 mutants (presented as schematic
in Fig. 1A) were made by a series of recombinant PCR
reactions. In brief, two separate PCR amplicons were
generated using two pairs of primers designed to amplify
the 5’ and 3’ region of sequences to be deleted using pBabe
wild-type EGFR as a template. The resulting purified PCR

Animal experiments were carried out in accordance
with IACUC of Laboratory Animal Research Center
(LARC; AAALAC International-approved facility)
in Samsung Medical Center. NIH-3T3 cells were
resuspended in PBS and 1 to 2 million cells were
injected subcutaneously into the nude mice, as previously
described [19]. For antitumor effect of EGFR targeted
therapies study, tumors were allowed to reach 50 to 70
mm3 in size, and then mice were randomly allocated to
the control (PBS), cetuximab, erlotinib, or afatinib group.
For the cetuximab-treated mice, we administered 1mg
per mouse by intra-peritoneal injection 3 times per week,
and for the afatinib and erlotinib-treated mice, we orally
administered 1 mg per mouse 3 times per week. Tumor
volume was measured 3 times per week using caliper and
estimated from the equation V=ab2/2, where a and b were
tumor length and width, respectively.
