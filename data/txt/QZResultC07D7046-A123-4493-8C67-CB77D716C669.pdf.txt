ABSTRACT
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as gefitinib and erlotinib are effective
against lung adenocarcinomas harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
mutations. However, cancer cells can develop resistance to these agents with
prolonged exposure; in over 50% of cases, this is attributable to the EGFR T790M
mutation. Moreover, additional resistance mutations can arise with the use of new
drugs. Cancer cell lines with specific mutations can enable the study of resistance
mechanisms. In this study, we introduced the EGFR T790M mutation into the PC9
human lung cancer cell line—which has a deletion in exon 19 of the EGFR gene—
by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPRassociated (Cas)9-mediated genome editing. EGFR pyrosequencing and peptide nucleic
acid clamping revealed that PC9 cells with EGFR T790M generated by CRISPR/Cas 9
had a higher T790M mutation rate than those with the same mutation generated by
long-term exposure to gefitinib (PC9-G); moreover, resistance to gefitinib in these
clones was higher than that in PC9-G cells. The clones were also highly sensitive
to the 3rd-generation EGFR TKI AZD9291, which is cytotoxic to lung cancer cells
with EGFR T790M. The CRISPR/Cas9 programmable nuclease system can be used to
generate various cancer cell lines with specific mutations that can facilitate studies
on resistance mechanisms and drug efficacy.

INTRODUCTION

patients will experience disease progression due to the
emergence of resistance to these drugs. Over half of TKIresistant cases can be attributed to the EGFR-T790M
mutation [3]. Therefore, new strategies for overcoming
resistance are needed for lung cancer treatment.
Several 3rd-generation EGFR TKIs [e.g., AZD9291
(osimertinib) [4], CO1686 [5], and olmutinib [6] have
been developed to overcome TKI resistance in lung
cancer that have shown promising effects. However,
new mutations such as EGFR C797S have emerged that
show resistance to these 3rd-generation drugs [7–9].
To investigate the molecular mechanisms of resistance

The elucidation of oncogenic molecular mechanisms
has changed lung cancer treatment approaches, especially
for adenocarcinoma (ADCC). Mutations in epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) are important steps in
ADCC development. A mutation in EGFR that confers
sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) has
been identified in lung ADCC [1, 2]; accordingly, EGFR
TKIs such as gefitinib or erlotinib have become standard
treatment in cases of unresectable or metastatic ADCC
with EGFR mutation. Although initially effective, most

and devise effective counter strategies, it is necessary
to establish cell lines that harbor the desired resistance
mutations. These are typically generated by long-term
continuous exposure of cancer cell lines to target drugs
from very low to high concentrations. However, this
process is lengthy—requiring several months or more—
and there is no guarantee that the resistance mutation that
arises will be of clinical significance.
In this study, we combined a CRISPR/Cas9-assisted
precision genome editing technology derived from a
bacterial adaptive immune system—clustered regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPRassociated (Cas)9—to generate a PC9 lung cancer cell line
harboring EGFR T790M. The characteristics of this cell
line were compared to those of PC9-G lung cancer cells
with EGFR T790M generated by continuous exposure to
gefitinib [10].

(PC9/3-2), and 7.6 (PC9/3-14). ∆Ct-1 > 2 indicated the
presence of a mutation. The EGFR T790M mutation rates
in PC9/3-2 and 3-14 were higher than that in PC9-G.
Thus, PC9/3-2 and PC9/3-14 cells developed by precise
genome editing technology had a higher content of
the T790M mutant allele than PC9-G cells, although a
minor discrepancy in the T790M mutation rate obtained
by pyrosequencing and PNA clamping methods were
observed in PC9/3-2 and PC/3-14 cells.

EGFR protein expression levels in mutated
human lung cancer cell lines

RESULTS

EGFR and phosphorylated (p)EGFR protein levels
in mutated human lung cancer cell lines were analyzed by
western blotting (Figure 3). The levels of both proteins
were slightly lower in PC9/3-2 and PC9/3-14 cells than
in PC9, PC9-G, and A549 cells, although the EGFR to
pEGFR ratio was similar among cell lines.

Point mutagenesis in human lung cancer cells
using CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP)

Reduced sensitivity of mutated human lung
cancer cell lines to gefitinib

We selected and tested three single-guided (sg)
RNAs targeting the target sequence on exon 20 of EGFR or
a nearby region in PC9 cells (Figure 1A). Three of these—
i.e., sgRNA #1, #2, and #3—showed high genome editing
efficiency of the target sequence in PC9 cells; however,
sgRNA #2 was not effective in Jurkat cells (Figure 1B).
We therefore designed single-stranded (ss)DNA donors
to induce precise genome editing events upon co-delivery
into cells with CRISPR RNP (Figure  1C). Together
with the specific mutation (T790M), ssDNA donor also
introduced a PvuII restriction site, which was detectable in
genomic DNA prepared from PC9 cells in which enhanced
green fluorescent protein (EGFP) CRISPR RNP and
ssDonor were introduced by electroporation (Figure 1D).
When PC9 cells treated with EGFP CRISPR RNP and
ssDonor were cultured in the presence of gefitinib at a
concentration that was toxic to untreated PC9 cells, many
surviving PC9 clones were obtained. The EGFP CRISPR/
RNP target sites of several gefitinib-resistant clones were
analyzed by pyrosequencing of genomic DNA and peptide
nucleic acid (PNA) clamping (Figure 2). The parent cell
line showed a rate of T790M mutation in exon 20 of
EGFR of 2%, which is the lower limit of detection by
pyrosequencing. In contrast, PC9-G cells generated by
long-term exposure to gefitinib showed a T790M mutation
rate of 14%. On the other hand, PC9/3-2 and PC9/3-14
cells (i.e., 2nd and 14th clones isolated from sgRNA 3,
respectively) showed mutation rates of 39% and 51%,
respectively. We also tested four clones from sgRNA1;
however, none had a T790M mutation rate > 5%.
We confirmed the presence of EGFR T790M by
PNA clamping. The change in threshold cycle (∆Ct)-1
values for T790M were −3.5 (PC9), 6.2 (PC9-G), 7.7

We analyzed the sensitivity of PC9/3-2 and PC9/314 cells relative to that of PC9, PC9-G, and A549 cells
to gefitinib with the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2Htetrazolium salt (MTS) assay. Cells were treated with
gefitinib at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 50 μM, and
proliferation was evaluated 96 h later. PC9 cells were the
most sensitive to gefitinib, whereas PC9-G cells showed
greater resistance. Interestingly, PC9/3-2 and PC9/3-14
cells showed higher resistance than the parental PC9 cell
line and PC9-G cells. The two cell lines did not differ in
terms of gefitinib resistance. A549 cells harboring wildtype EGFR showed the greatest resistance to gefitinib
(Figure 4A and Table 1).

Human lung cancer cell lines harboring EGFR
T790M mutation are inhibited by a 3rdgeneration EGFR TKI
We tested the viability of human lung cancer cell
lines upon treatment with the 3rd-generation EGFR
TKI AZD9291 (osimertinib), which has been shown to
be cytotoxic to lung cancer cells harboring the EGFR
T790M mutation. Cells were treated with various doses
of AZD9291 and viability was assessed 96 h later with
the MTS assay (Figure 4B). Interestingly, the sensitivities
of PC9-G, PC9/3-2, and PC9/3-14 cell lines to AZD9291
were similar to that of PC9 cells (Table 1). In contrast,
A549 cells were highly resistant to AZD9291 relative
to the other cell lines. These data indicate that human
lung cancer cell lines harboring EGFR T790M mutation
engineered by CRISPR/Cas9 can be inhibited by the 3rdgeneration EGFR TKI AZD9291.

PC9 cells harboring EGFR T790M show
increased apoptosis upon treatment with
AZD9291 but not gefitinib

RNA with a 20-bp sequence complementary to a new
target site needs to be generated by simple molecular
cloning to obtain an expression vector, with enzymatic
or chemical production of short RNA molecules [12, 13].
Of the three sgRNA sequences we initially designed for
target site in the EGFR gene, two were used successfully
to establish PC9 cell clones with the T790M mutations
that exhibited gefitinib resistance. Pyrosequencing of
the EGFR gene revealed that three clones derived from
sgRNA3 (3-2, 3-12, and 3-14) had high rates of T790M
mutation (39%, 18%, and 51%, respectively) while
retaining the exon 19 deletion (2234–2257C) of the
parental cell line (PC-9) (Figure 2A). The PNA clamping
assay showed similar results, except that a discrepancy
was found in the rate of T790M mutation obtained by the
pyrosequencing and PNA clamping approaches in PC9/312 and 3/14 cells (Figure 2B). Two of the clones (3-2 and
3-14) showed stronger resistance to gefitinib than PC9-G
cells, and there was negligible apoptosis induced in these
lines even at concentrations as high as 10 μM, suggesting
that the degree of resistance is related to the rate of T790M
mutation. On the other hand, PC9-3/2 and 3/14 cell lines
were highly sensitive to AZD9291, a 3rd-generation
TKI, indicating that these cells exhibit clinically relevant
responses to drug treatment.
In conclusion, we generated lung cancer cell lines
harboring an EGFR T790M mutation with a CRISPR/
Cas9-based approach. This technique can be used to
generate cell lines with different mutations of clinical
significance such as EGFR C797S, which can facilitate
the study of resistance mechanisms as well as drug testing.

The sensitivity of lung cancer cell lines to gefitinib
and AZD9291 was investigated by detecting apoptotic
cells labeled with Annexin V. Gefitinib did not induce
significant apoptosis in PC9-G, PC9/3-2, or PC9/3-14
cells at concentrations up to 10 μM. However, AZD9291
potently induced apoptosis in the three cell lines at
rates similar to that in PC9 cells. In contrast, A549 cells
harboring wild-type EGFR was unaffected by gefitinib and
AZD9291 treatment (Figure 5).

DISCUSSION
In cases where several different mutations are
present in patients who exhibit TKI resistance, it is almost
impossible to generate cell lines that harbor the specific
mutation using the traditional method of exposing cells
to increasing concentrations of drug. Inducing specific
mutations in cell lines by genetic approaches can facilitate
the development of new and effective drugs. CRISPR/
Cas9 nuclease is one example of engineered nuclease
platforms that can be used for this purpose [11]. In this
study, we used CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases-assisted genome
editing to generate lung cancer cell lines harboring the
EGFR T790M mutation. An advantage of this system is
that generating an endonuclease is easier than by other
methods; with a constant Cas9 component, only a guide

MATERIALS AND METHODS

(Santa Cruz, CA, USA; I-19). Gefitinib was obtained
from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA) and
AZD9291 (osimertinib) was from Selleckchem (Houston,
TX, USA).

Cell lines and culture
PC-9 is lung adenocarcinoma cell line with a
deletion in exon 19 of the EGFR gene that exhibits
high sensitivity to TKIs. The PC-9G cell line (PC-9
cells resistant to gefitinib) was established by long-term
exposure to gefitinib, and was shown to harbor the EGFR
T790M mutation [10]. The cell lines were a gift from Dr.
C.H. Kim (Korea Cancer Center Hospital). A549 cells
harboring wild-type EGFR were purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA).
Cells were maintained in Roswell Park Memorial Institute
(RPMI) 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.

Generation of PC9 cell lines with EGFR T790M
mutation by CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases
Preparation of Cas9 protein with sgRNAs and singlestranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs)
Recombinant Cas9 protein tagged with a nuclear
localization signal and a his6 tag were expressed in E. coli
(BL21-DE3 strain) and purified by Ni-nitrilotriacetic
acid chromatography. Three sgRNAs were synthesized
by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase as
previously described [13] (Figure 1A). The oligonucleotide
used for homology-directed recombination consisted of a
127-base ssODN molecule containing two 50-bp outer
arms homologous to the endogenous EGFR genomic region
flanking the exon encoding T790, and was synthesized by
Integrated DNA Technologies (San Diego, CA, USA).

Antibodies and EGFR TKI
The antibody against EGFR was purchased from
Abcam (Cambridge, UK; ab2430) and the antibody against
actin was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology

Figure 3: Western blot analysis for the EGFR protein. All EGFR proteins from PC9, PC9-G, PC9/3-2,-14 and A549 were of the
same size.

Cell proliferation assay

Electroporation, genotyping, and establishment of
gefitinib-resistant PC9 cell lines

PC9, PC9-G, PC9-3-2, PC9-3-14, and A549 human
lung cancer cell lines were seeded at 3 × 103 cells/well
in 96-well plates and treated with gefitinib or AZD9291;
96 h later, cell proliferation was assessed using the
CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation
Assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Three independent
experiments were performed and used to determine mean
half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50).

CRISPR RNPs and ssODN donors were
electroporated into Jurkat cells (two 20-ms pulses at
1300 V) and PC9 cells (single 30-ms pulse at 950 V) using
the Neon transfection system (Invitrogen) The T7E1 assay
was performed as previously described (Figure 1B) [14].
To establish gefitinib-resistant PC9 cell lines, cells were
transfected with EGFR CRISPR RNPs along with the
ssODN donor and cultured for 7 days to allow recovery.
Gefitinib was then added to the medium at a final
concentration of 1 μM for 2 weeks. Surviving cells were
seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 0.5 cells per well in
order to establish a monoclonal cell population. Genomic
DNA from isolated monoclonal gefitinib-resistant clones
was subjected to pyrosequencing to confirm the presence
of edited EGFR alleles.

Apoptosis assay
Human lung cancer cell lines were treated with
gefitinib or AZD9291 for 48 h, and apoptotic cells were
detected using the FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection kit
(BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer
(Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA). Three independent
experiments were performed and the mean proportions of
cells in early or late apoptosis were determined.

EGFR pyrosequencing
EGFR mutations in exons 18–21 were detected by
pyrosequencing as previously described [15, 16]. A 40-μl
aliquot of PCR product was bound to streptavidin
Sepharose High Performance (GE Healthcare, Uppsala,
Sweden), purified, washed, denatured in 0.2 mol/l NaOH
solution, and washed again. The pyrosequencing primer
(0.3 μmol/l) was then annealed to the purified singlestranded PCR product, and pyrosequencing was performed
on a PyroMark ID system (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

PNA clamping method for EGFR exon 19
deletion and generation of T790M mutation

REFERENCES

The PNA Clamp EGFR Mutation Detection kit
(Panagene, Daejeon, Korea) was used to detect EGFR gene
mutations by real-time PCR. All reactions were performed
in a 20-μl volume with template DNA, primer and PNA
probe sets, and fluorophore PCR master mix. Real-time PCR
was performed using a CFX 96 kit (Bio-Rad, Philadelphia,
PA, USA). PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 94°C
for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 70°C for
20 s, 63°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s. Each of 29 EGFR
gene mutations was detected by one-step PNA-mediated
real-time PCR clamping. PCR efficiency was determined by
measuring Ct values, which were automatically calculated
from PCR amplification plots of fluorescence vs. number of
cycles. ∆Ct-1 was calculated to ensure that the sample and
standard Ct values were from the tested and wild-type DNA
control samples, respectively. The sample was considered
to harbor a mutation when the ∆Ct-1 value (standard minus
sample Ct value) was > 2.0 [17].
