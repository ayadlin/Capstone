Summary
Activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway in tumors is modulated by negative feedback, including
mTORC1-mediated inhibition of upstream signaling. We now show that AKT inhibition induces
the expression and phosphorylation of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). In a wide
spectrum of tumor types, inhibition of AKT induces a conserved set of RTKs including HER3,
IGF-1R, and Insulin receptor. This is in part due to mTORC1 inhibition and in part secondary to a
FOXO-dependent activation of receptor expression. PI3K-AKT inhibitors relieve this feedback
and activate RTK signaling; this may attenuate their antitumor activity. Consistent with this
model, we find that, in tumors in which AKT suppresses HER3 expression, combined inhibition of
AKT and HER kinase activity is more effective than either alone.

Introduction

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) – protein kinase B (PKB/AKT) – mammalian
target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase cascade transmits signals from ligand
stimulated receptor tyrosine kinases to effector molecules that control metabolism,
proliferation, size, survival, and motility (Guertin and Sabatini, 2007; Vivanco and Sawyers,
2002). In cancer, this pathway is frequently hyperactivated as a result of: (1) activation of
receptor tyrosine kinases by mutation (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) or gene
amplification (HER2), (2) activating mutations of components of the pathway such as PI3K
or AKT, and (3) deletion or decreased function of tumor suppressors such as the PIP3
phosphatase, PTEN (Phosphatase and TENsin homolog) (Hynes and Lane, 2005; Vivanco
and Sawyers, 2002). Such lesions are extremely common in cancer.

Tumors with PTEN or PIK3CA mutations or HER2 amplification have been shown to be
dependent on PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling for maintenance of the transformed phenotype
and hypersensitive to inhibition of its components. This has led to a major effort to develop
inhibitors of PI3K, AKT, mTOR and other components of the pathway (Courtney et al.,
2010; Workman et al., 2010). Analogs of the natural product rapamycin, an inhibitor of the
mTORC1 complex, were among the first inhibitors of the PI3K kinase pathway to be used
for the treatment of cancer. Rapamycin does effectively inhibit mTORC1 signaling;
however, it also relieves mTORC1 dependent feedback inhibition of IGF1 receptor
signaling. This results in activation of PI3K-AKT signaling and enhanced phosphorylation
of non-mTORC1 targets of AKT, such as the FOXO family of transcription factors (Haruta
et al., 2000; O’Reilly et al., 2006).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Physiologic activation of signaling is regulated by feedback inhibition of components of the
network and is a feature of both normal and oncogene-transformed cells. Relief of this
feedback might be a common response to anticancer drugs and could attenuate the
therapeutic response (Courtois-Cox et al., 2006; O’Reilly et al., 2006). We reasoned that
specific inhibitors of other components of the PI3K-AKT pathway will reactivate different
aspects of the network. To examine the role played by AKT in the feedback regulation of
activated mitogenic signal transduction, we employed a specific, allosteric AKT inhibitor
and examined its effect on the expression and phosphorylation of the receptor tyrosine
kinases that commonly stimulate these signaling pathways (DeFeo-Jones et al., 2005;
Lindsley et al., 2005; She et al., 2008).

Results
AKT inhibition is associated with HER3 induction
We used selective inhibitors to determine whether AKT mediates feedback inhibition of
PI3K signaling in tumors in which it is dysregulated. AKTi-1/2 and AKTi-1/2/3 are PHdomain dependent, non-ATP-competitive inhibitors which potently inhibit AKT1 and AKT2
and not other AGC kinases, with AKTi-1/2/3 having greater potency against AKT3 (Barnett
et al., 2005; Lindsley et al., 2005). The drugs share similar potency against activated AKT in
the HER2 amplified breast cancer cell line BT-474 as seen in Fig. S1 (She et al., 2008). The
drugs prevent binding of AKT to the plasma membrane and thus its phosphorylation by
PDK1, so, unlike ATP-competitive inhibitors, they block, rather than activate AKT
phosphorylation (Fig. 1A) (Okuzumi et al., 2009).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Breast cancers with HER2-amplification have elevated levels of AKT and ERK
phosphorylation and are dependent on the former, but not the latter for maintenance of the
transformed phenotype (Basso et al., 2002; Hermanto et al., 2001; She et al., 2008; Solit et
al., 2006). In these tumors, PI3K-AKT signaling is HER2-dependent and predominantly
driven by HER2-HER3 heterodimers (Holbro et al., 2003; Yakes et al., 2002). HER3 is a
kinase-defective member of the HER kinase family that contains six tyrosines in its
intracellular domain that, when phosphorylated act as high affinity docking sites for the p85
subunit of PI3K. In breast cancers, overexpressed HER2 dimerizes with and phosphorylates
HER3, which binds to and activates PI3K (Holbro et al., 2003).
AKT inhibitors block AKT signaling in these cells and cause growth arrest and apoptosis
(She et al., 2008). We asked whether activation of AKT feedback regulates the HER kinase
family members that drive the pathway. In Fig. 1A, we determined the effect of AKT
inhibition on HER kinase expression and phosphorylation in BT474, a breast cancer cell line
with HER2 amplification. Treatment of BT-474 cells with 1μM AKTi-1/2 inhibits
phosphorylation of AKT and its substrate, PRAS40 by 1 hour after drug is added. At 24
hours, AKT phosphorylation begins to rise, but remains significantly inhibited at 72 hours.

AKT inhibition causes a marked change in the expression and phosphorylation of HER
kinase family members. The expression of EGFR, HER3, and HER4 is induced beginning
two to four hours after drug addition and reaches a maximum approximately 24 hours after
drug exposure (1.6, 4.1, and 2.5 fold induction). The already high levels of HER2 expression
do not change appreciably. There is a concomitant four-fold induction of the tyrosine
phosphorylation of HER3 at both the Y1197 and Y1289 sites whereas phosphorylation of
EGFR (Y1068), HER2 (Y1221), and HER4 (Y1284) declines over this period (0.4, 0.5, and
0.7 fold). Of the HER family receptors, only HER3 expression and phosphorylation are
coordinately upregulated in these cells. Inhibition of the PI3K-AKT pathway using an ATP
competitive AKT kinase inhibitor or a PI3K inhibitor also results in upregulation of HER3
and P-HER3 expression (Fig. S1). Moreover, interfering RNA against AKT1, AKT2, and
AKT3 result in induction of HER3 expression and phosphorylation 72 hours after
transfection (Fig. 1B). HER3 levels in the plasma membrane increase and this is
accompanied by increased HER3 heterodimerization with HER2 and association with the
p85 subunit of PI3K (Fig. S1). These data suggest that PI3K-AKT activation in response to
HER2 amplification and overexpression is associated with an AKT-dependent
downregulation of HER family protein expression, which is relieved by the AKT inhibitor.
Although AKT and ERK signaling are both driven by HER2 amplification, feedback
regulation of receptor expression is mediated by the former but not the latter. Selective
inhibition of ERK phosphorylation with the MEK inhibitor, PD325901, has no effect on
HER2 or HER3 expression or phosphorylation in tumor cells with HER2 amplification (Fig.
1C).
Induction of HER3 expression in response to AKT inhibition does not require serum factors.
Serum starvation of HER2 amplified breast cancer cells is associated with increased HER3
expression, and increased phosphorylation of HER2, HER3 and AKT (Fig. 1D). In these
cells, 1μM AKTi-1/2 led to marked induction of HER3 expression, but no further induction
of HER3 phosphorylation. The results distinguish induction of phosphorylation of the
receptor from induction of expression. Whereas AKT inhibition can further induce HER3
expression in absence of serum factors, it does not affect HER3 phosphorylation.
Induction of AKT activation reduces HER3 expression

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

These results suggest that, in HER2 amplified breast cancer cells, PI3K activation may
induce an AKT-dependent feedback inhibition of HER3 expression and activation. To assess
the effects of inducing AKT activation, BT-474 cells were treated with DMSO or 100nM
AKTi-1/2/3 in serum containing media for 12 hours (lane 2 and lane 7, Fig. 2A) and then the
compound was washed out and fresh medium was added (Fig. 2A). Reactivation of AKT
phosphorylation occurred four hours after the drug was removed and was sustained. This
was associated with decreased HER3 expression and phosphorylation eight hours after drug
washout. Levels of HER3 and phosphorylated HER3 declined to near steady state levels.
The data suggest that AKT activation negatively regulates HER3 expression and
phosphorylation in HER2-amplified breast cancer cells and that inhibition of AKT relieves
this feedback.
The phosphorylation of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases is induced by AKT inhibition
Multiple receptor tyrosine kinases activate PI3K-AKT signaling in normal and tumor cells.
In particular, many of the metabolic effects and other consequences of stimulation of the
Insulin and IGF1 receptors (IGF-1R) are mediated via induction of PI3K-AKT signaling.
We used an anti-phosphotyrosine receptor antibody array to assess whether receptor tyrosine
kinases other than HER3 were induced in response to AKT inhibition (Fig. 2B). These RTK
arrays detect phosphorylation of 42 receptor tyrosine kinases (Stommel et al., 2007). In
BT-474 cells, HER2 and HER3 were the most prominent phosphorylated RTKs detected

(first set of panels, 50μg loaded). Twenty four hours after exposure to the AKT inhibitor, PHER2 was not significantly changed while P-HER3 was strongly induced. Removing the
anti-P-HER2 and anti-P-HER3 dots from the array and increasing the amount of loaded
protein (250 μg), increased the sensitivity of the assay. This allowed detection of multiple
other receptors in the untreated control. The phosphorylation of a group of RTKs (HER3,
FLT-3, HER4, EphA7, MSPR, Insulin receptor (IR), EphA1, IGF-1R, FGFR3, and FGFR1)
was induced at least three-fold 24 hours after inhibition of AKT. The induction of the total
tyrosine phosphorylation of HER4, in which 19 P-TYR sites have been identified, contrasts
with the loss of phosphorylation of the Y1284 site on HER4 in Fig. 1A (Kaushansky et al.,
2008). Overall, the data suggest that the phosphorylation of a group of receptors is feedback
inhibited in response to PI3K-AKT activation and induced when AKT is inhibited.
Activated RTKs are induced in many tumor models

In HER2 amplified tumor cells, overexpression of HER2 dysregulates PI3K-AKT signaling
by promoting HER2-HER3 heterodimer formation. Our data suggests that AKT activation
feedback downregulates HER3 and a set of other receptor tyrosine kinases in these cells. We
asked whether this is a general phenomenon or peculiar to tumor cells in which HER2 drives
PI3K-AKT signaling. We used the phospho-RTK arrays to determine if the effects of AKT
inhibition on receptor phosphorylation were shared among different cancer models (Fig. 3A,
Fig. S2). Two additional HER2 amplified cell lines (SK-BR3 and MDA-MB-453) were
evaluated. When the results were quantified and the mean of the three cell lines taken,
twelve receptors (HER3, IGF-1R, Insulin receptor, HER2, HER4, MSPR, SCFR, EphA1,
EphA7, FLT-3, ROR1, and RET) had an induction greater than 3-fold after 24 hours of
AKT inhibition. P-HER3 was highly induced in all three of these models. These results were
compared with six tumor cell lines lacking HER2 amplification and representing four
different cell lineages (LNCAP - prostate, IGROV-1 - ovarian, MDA-MB-231 - breast, and
NCI-H292, NCI-H3255, NCI-H1975 - lung). In these six cell lines, nine receptors had
average inductions above 3 fold (HER3, IGF-1R, Insulin receptor, MER, MET, RET,
ROR1, TIE-2, and EphA7). Comparing the HER2 and non-HER2 lists, we noted overlap of
IGF-1R, Insulin receptor, HER3, EphA7, and RET, which were significantly induced (>3
fold mean induction) in the majority of these cell lines. We evaluated the effect of AKT
inhibition in a non-transformed, breast epithelial cell line, MCF10A, and found that only,
IGF-1R, Insulin receptor and PDGFRa were induced after AKT inhibition. Fig. 3B lists the
receptors in the ten cell lines for which average phosphorylation was induced at least 3 fold.
The number of cell lines in which each receptor was induced and the average degree of
induction are shown. IGF-1R, Insulin receptor, HER3, EphA7, and RET were induced in the
majority of models, whereas HER4, EphA1, ROR1, and MET phosphorylations were
induced in a subset. We conclude that inhibition of AKT induces the phosphorylation of a
group of receptor tyrosine kinases and induction is not confined to a particular type of tumor
or to tumors in which signaling is driven by HER2.
AKT inhibition induces the expression of the HER3, IGF1R and Insulin receptors
In BT-474 cells, AKT inhibition caused a parallel and equivalent induction of HER3
phosphorylation and expression, consistent with the possibility that the former is due to the
latter. We evaluated whether induction of HER3, IR, and IGF-1R phosphorylation could be
explained by induction in the expression of these proteins. In six out of seven cell lines
without HER2 amplification, AKT inhibition caused increased levels of HER3 protein (Fig.
3C). Increases in Insulin receptor were detected in 5 out of 7 of these cell lines and IGF-1R
was detected and induced in 6 out of 7 cell lines. In contrast, RET protein was detected and
induced in only 2 out of the 7 cell lines and HER4 protein was not induced in any of the 7
(Fig. 3C). The induction in HER3, IGF-1R and Insulin receptor protein occurred in the
majority of tested models and was not restricted to a specific tumor lineage. Moreover, in

the non-transformed model, MCF10A, upregulation in the protein levels of HER3, Insulin
receptor, and IGF-1R was also observed. It was notable that induction of phosphorylated
IGF-1R and Insulin receptor, but not P-HER3 was seen in this model, which may be related
to the comparably low levels of activated HER kinases in this cell. The average induction in
protein level of these three receptors across these cell lines and additional HER2 amplified
or EGFR mutant cancer cells was quantified by densitometry. All three receptors are
commonly induced (HER3 – 13/14, IGF-1R – 12/14, Insulin Receptor – 14/14) with average
inductions of HER3-2.8 fold, IGF-1R-2.2 fold, and Insulin receptor-2.5 fold.
Induction of expression of HER3, IGF1R or insulin receptor was almost always associated
with increased phosphorylation (in 25 out of 28 instances). However, in most cases,
induction of phosphorylation was out of proportion to induction of expression (Table S1).
Therefore, the induction of phosphorylation of these proteins can only be partially explained
by increased protein expression. Nevertheless, the data suggest that the expression of a
common set of receptors is upregulated among cell lines and this correlates with the
induction of their phosphorylation in response to AKT inhibition.
HER kinase dependence of induced P-RTKs

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In most of the tumor cells we examined, the induction of HER3 phosphorylation was the
most prominent effect of AKT inhibition. We used selective HER1/2 kinase inhibitors to
determine whether induction of phosphorylation of receptors was HER kinase dependent.
Lapatinib, a HER2/EGFR inhibitor that potently blocks HER2 kinase was used to address
this question in breast cancer cells with HER2 amplification (Karaman et al., 2008).
Gefitinib, which preferentially inhibits EGFR kinase activity, was used in H292, a non-small
cell lung cancer cell line with overexpression of wild type EGFR. We compared the effects
of the AKTi-1/2/3, Lapatinib, or the combination on the induction of receptor
phosphorylation in the HER2-amplified breast cancer cell (BT-474) (Fig. 4A). After twenty
four hours exposure to AKTi-1/2/3 (1μM, 2nd panel) phosphorylation of HER3, IGF-1R, IR
and several other receptors was induced. When the HER1/2 kinase inhibitor (1μM) was
combined with the AKT inhibitor, levels of phosphorylated HER3, IGF-1R, and Insulin
receptor were repressed below basal levels. Treatment with Lapatinib alone blocked the
phosphorylation of all the assessed RTKs below steady state levels. The effect of the HER
kinase inhibitors is unlikely to be due to direct inhibition of IGF1R or insulin receptor
kinases, to which they do not bind avidly (Karaman et al., 2008). Moreover, these inhibitors
do not suppress IGF1R or insulin receptor phosphorylation in H1975 in which the T790M
mutant EGFR is resistant to Gefitinib (Fig. S3). These data suggest that induction of IGF1R
and IR phosphorylation is HER2-dependent in breast cancers in which this receptor is
amplified.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We evaluated the HER kinase dependence of induction of receptor phosphorylation in a
non-HER2 dependent model as well, NCI-H292. AKT inhibition resulted in induction of
phosphorylated HER3, IGF-1R, Insulin receptor and several other receptors including
FGFR1 and EphA7 (Fig. 4B, Fig. S3). In this case, the AKTi-induction of phosphorylation
of some but not all of the RTKs could be suppressed by the HER1/2 inhibitor Gefitinib
(5μM). For instance, phosphorylation of HER3 and Insulin receptor are suppressed below
basal levels by the combination, and induction of P-EphA7 is significantly weaker. In
contrast, induction of P-FGFR1 is unaffected by Gefitinib and IGF-1R phosphorylation is
supra-induced by the combination. The data suggests that in cells in which HER2 is not the
dominant receptor tyrosine kinase, the HER kinase-dependence of induction of receptor
phosphorylation is variable.

Induction of receptor expression by AKT inhibitors is not dependent on HER kinase
activity

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

AKT inhibition leads to a parallel induction of the expression and phosphorylation of
IGF-1R, Insulin receptor, and HER3. We asked whether the induction of expression of these
RTKs is dependent upon HER kinase activity as well. BT-474 cells were treated for 8 or 24
hours with 1μM AKTi-1/2/3, 1μM Lapatinib, or the combination (Fig. 4C). As expected,
both inhibitors block AKT phosphorylation (P-S473). The induction of HER3 and IGF-1R/
insulin receptor phosphorylation (antibody detects both receptors) by the AKTi was
completely blocked by Lapatinib. In contrast, the induction of IGF-1R, Insulin receptor, and
HER3 protein expression was unaffected by the addition of Lapatinib. Similarly, the AKTimediated induction of HER3 phosphorylation but not protein expression was blocked by
Lapatinib in the H292 lung cancer cell line (Fig. 4D). These data show that the upregulation
of receptor expression caused by AKT-inhibition is not dependent on HER kinase activity
while the induction of phosphorylation is.
Inhibition of AKT but not mTORC1 induces HER3, IGF-1R, and Insulin receptor expression

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The mTORC1 complex is one of the primary downstream targets of AKT signaling. Direct
inhibition of mTORC1 with rapamycin blocks S6Kinase-dependent feedback inhibition of
IRS-1 expression and activates IGF-1R signaling (O’Reilly et al., 2006). We asked whether
induction of receptor expression in response to AKT inhibition was mediated by mTORC1
inhibition. The effects of HER2, AKT, and mTORC1 inhibition on HER kinase expression
and signaling were examined in BT474 cells (Fig. 5A). Cells were exposed to AKTi-1/2,
Lapatinib, or Rapamycin for up to 24 hours. Each inhibitor causes potent inhibition of its
respective target (P-HER2 for Lapatinib, P-S6K for Rapamycin, and P-AKT for AKTi-1/2)
at 8 and 24 hours. Rapamycin and AKTi-1/2 each induce HER3 phosphorylation, although
the effect of the latter is more marked (Fig 5A, 5B, Fig. S4). Both AKTi-1/2 and Lapatinib
inhibit AKT phosphorylation and induce HER3 expression. In contrast, rapamycin does not
induce expression, only phosphorylation. Thus, AKT and mTORC1 both regulate the
feedback inactivation of HER kinase signaling. However, mTORC1 affects HER3
phosphorylation but not expression. AKT but not mTORC1 is responsible for the feedback
regulation of HER3 expression.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We compared the effects of Rapamycin and AKTi-1/2 on the phosphorylation of receptor
tyrosine kinases in BT474 (Fig. 5B). After 24 hours of treatment, the effects of the two
drugs were markedly different. Rapamycin induced HER3 phosphorylation more than 4-fold
(2.5 fold-less than the AKTi-1/2) and had no effect on Insulin receptor or IGF1-R
phosphorylation. Several other receptors (FLT-3, HER4, MSPR, EphA1, and EphA7) whose
phosphorylation was induced by AKT inhibition were either less affected or unaffected by
Rapamycin. In contrast, rapamycin induced the phosphorylation of two receptors (MER and
MuSK) more potently than AKT inhibition did. These findings suggest that inhibition of
AKT and mTORC1 relieve different aspects of PI3K-induced feedback.
AKT inhibition upregulates RTK transcript levels
As levels of HER3, IGF-1R, and Insulin receptor protein increase after AKT inhibition, we
determined whether the mRNAs encoding these receptors were affected as well. We
compared the effects of AKT inhibition and mTORC1 inhibition on HER2, HER3, IGF-1R,
Insulin Receptor, RET, and MET mRNA levels. Insulin Receptor, HER3, and IGF-1R
mRNA were all induced between 2.5 and 5 fold after exposure of cells to either the AKT
inhibitor or Lapatinib but not to Rapamycin (Fig. 6A). Rapamycin induced only minor
changes in mRNA expression. Expression of HER2, RET, and MET mRNAs was not
induced by any of the inhibitors. The results confirm that relief of feedback inhibition of
RTK signaling in response to AKT inhibition cannot be explained by inhibition of mTORC1

alone. Feedback inhibition of mitogenic signaling in response to AKT activation must be
mediated by other targets as well.

FOXO transcription factors mediate induction of RTK expression

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

FOXO transcription factors regulate a number of genes involved in cell survival and
longevity and are inhibited when phosphorylated by AKT (Kenyon et al., 1993; Kops et al.,
1999; Myatt and Lam, 2007). The Drosophila Insulin Receptor has been demonstrated to be
dependent upon the activity of the FOXO transcription factor for its expression (Ayala et al.,
1999; Puig and Tjian, 2005). As inhibition of the PI3K-AKT pathway causes
dephosphorylation of FOXO proteins and prevents their nuclear translocation, we
investigated whether mammalian FOXO transcription factors may be involved in the
induction of the RTKs by the AKT inhibitor (Myatt and Lam, 2007). FOXO1, 3 and 4 were
depleted individually and in combination using specific, small interfering RNAs and the
effect on basal and induced levels of receptors was examined (Fig. 6B). In BT-474 cells,
knockdown of these factors alone or in combination had little effect on steady state levels of
HER3, IGF-1R, or Insulin receptor mRNA expression. However, the induction of receptor
mRNA by the AKT inhibitor was markedly diminished by FOXO knockdown. Of the three
isoforms, inhibition of FOXO3 expression had the most potent effect, diminishing HER3,
IGF1R, and insulin receptor induction by 64, 90, and 69%. Knocking down FOXO1 or
FOXO4 had less effect, diminishing HER3 and Insulin Receptor inductions by <20%.
However, combined knockdown of all three isoforms was most potent, diminishing HER3,
IGF1R, and insulin receptor induction by 73, 91, and 80% of that in the control cells.
Knockdown of FOXO isoforms had comparable effects on receptor protein expression in
BT-474 cells and the non-transformed MCF10A cell line (Fig. 6D and Fig. S5). Moreover,
the induction of phosphorylation of HER3, IGF-1R, and Insulin Receptor was significantly
reduced in cells in which FOXOs were silenced (Fig. S5). Induction of P-HER3 was reduced
nearly three-fold whereas inductions of P-IGF-1R and P-Insulin receptor did not occur. The
incomplete suppression of induction of HER3 phosphorylation in cells in which FOXO
expression was knocked down is consistent with the modest induction of HER3
phosphorylation by Rapamycin (Fig. 5). This suggests that the increase in RTK
phosphorylation in response to AKT inhibition is due both to a FOXO-dependent increase in
receptor expression and to increased phosphorylation in response to TORC1 inhibition.
These data show that activation of FOXOs in response to AKT inhibition is required for the
upregulation of RTK expression.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

FOXO protein binding to the HER3, IGF-1R, and Insulin receptor promoters and whether
binding is altered in response to AKT inhibition was examined by chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 6C). BT-474 cells were treated with AKT inhibitor, fixed
with formalin, and the total chromatin was collected. Immunoprecipitation with a
combination of antibodies against FOXO1, FOXO3 and FOXO4 resulted in enhanced
amplification of the RTK 5’UTR over input chromatin as measured by RT-PCR. Exposure
of cells to the AKT inhibitor resulted in an enhancement of RTK amplification (HER3 – 4.3
fold, IGF-1R – 2.4 fold, INSR – 2.3 fold), whereas inhibition of FOXO protein expression
with siRNA abolished this effect. These data suggest that activation of FOXO proteins is
directly responsible for induction of RTK transcription.
Combined inhibition of AKT and HER1/2 kinases is effective in vivo
The prevalence of AKT activation in human tumors has led to a widespread effort to
develop inhibitors of the pathway. Relief of feedback inhibition of signaling by these
inhibitors may limit their therapeutic effects. The induction of HER3 expression in response
to the AKTi-1/2/3 in BT-474 cells is associated with increased HER3 binding to PI3K and to
HER2 as shown by co-immunoprecipitation and cross-linking experiments in Fig. S1.

We used HER kinase inhibitors to ask whether blocking induction of HER family kinase
activity enhances the antitumor efficacy of AKT inhibitors in vivo. We investigated the
effects of the combination in two models in which AKT inhibition induces HER3: BT474, in
which HER2 is amplified (Fig. 7A) and H292 non-small cell lung cancer in which wild type
EGFR is overexpressed (Fig. 7B). In both models, AKT inhibition induces HER3 and
IGF1R/Insulin receptor phosphorylation (7C, 7D).
In the BT474 model, chronic administration of the AKT inhibitor completely inhibits tumor
growth, but does not cause regression (7A). In H292, the AKT inhibitor causes a marginal
decrease in growth rate (7B). In order to determine whether inhibition of feedback induction
of HER kinases increases the therapeutic effects of the AKT inhibitor, we used low doses of
HER kinase inhibitors that affect baseline HER3 phosphorylation only minimally, but do
prevent induction of HER3/IGF1R/Insulin receptor phosphorylation in response to the AKT
inhibitor (7C,D). Although Lapatinib given at a more frequent schedule has significant
antitumor effects in this model, at this schedule the Lapatinib had little effect. However, it
significantly altered the response to the AKT inhibitor and the combination caused partial
tumor regression. Maximal doses of the AKT inhibitor alone cause growth arrest without
regression in this model.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In the H292 model, the AKT inhibitor did not significantly block tumor growth. However,
the addition of the EGFR kinase inhibitor to the AKTi-1/2/3 caused significant and
persistent tumor regression (7B). Iressa by itself did significantly inhibit tumor growth but,
as previously reported, the effects were transient and significantly less than the combination
(Buck et al., 2008). Thus, doses of HER kinase inhibitor sufficient to prevent relief of
feedback inhibition of HER3 by the AKT inhibitor sensitize tumors to this drug. In keeping
with these data, we find that prevention of receptor tyrosine kinase induction with an Hsp90
inhibitor also sensitizes tumors to AKT inhibitors and causes profound tumor regression in
the BT474 model (Fig. S6).

Discussion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

It is increasingly clear that dysregulation of mitogenic signaling by constitutively activated
oncoproteins in cancer cells drives high levels of feedback inhibition of the signaling
network (Courtois-Cox et al., 2006; O’Reilly et al., 2006; Pratilas et al., 2009). This may
have important phenotypic consequences in the transformed cell. Hyperactivation of
signaling by the oncoprotein may depend on its relative insensitivity to negative feedback or
to other mutations that inactivate elements of the feedback machinery. Anticancer drugs that
inhibit oncoprotein function will relieve this negative feedback and thus reactivate multiple
signaling pathways that limit the extent and duration of the anticancer effects.
The PI3K-AKT signaling pathway is a central downstream effector of growth factor
receptors and is often dysregulated in cancer. The Insulin and IGF1 receptors exert many of
their physiologic effects by activating PI3K, but mutation or overexpression of other
receptors, such as HER2 in breast cancer, commonly dysregulate the pathway in tumors
(Holbro et al., 2003; Kooijman et al., 1995). Activation of PI3K-AKT leads to activation of
many downstream targets that together account for the proliferative, antiapoptotic and
metabolic effects of the pathway. Of these, the mTOR kinase has attracted much attention
because of its central function in integrating nutrient and energy availability and growth
signals in the regulation of cell proliferation and size. mTOR functions in two multiprotein
complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2 (Guertin and Sabatini, 2007). The natural product
rapamycin is a specific inhibitor of mTORC1 and leads to dephosphorylation of its two most
well characterized substrates S6 kinase and 4EBP1(Brunn et al., 1997; von Manteuffel et al.,
1997). It thereby inhibits cap-dependent translation and cell proliferation.

Experiments with rapamycin first revealed the extent and clinical implications of oncogene
induced feedback. Insulin signaling is feedback regulated in part, by an mTOR/S6Kdependent phosphorylation and downregulation of the major insulin receptor substrate IRS1
(Haruta et al., 2000). Inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin relieves this feedback, activates
insulin and IGF signaling, and thereby activates PI3K and ERK signaling (O’Reilly et al.,
2006). This occurs in vivo in patients and likely decreases the therapeutic efficacy of the
drug (Mellinghoff et al., 2005; O’Reilly et al., 2006).
PI3K and AKT regulate many processes besides mTORC1 activity. We reasoned that, in
tumor cells, mutational activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway would induce mTOR
independent feedback pathway as well. We used a selective, allosteric inhibitor of AKT to
assess AKT-dependent feedback in breast tumor cells in which the pathway is driven by
amplification of HER2. We found that inhibition of AKT in these cells induced the
expression of HER3. There was a concomitant induction of HER3-HER2 heterodimers and a
marked induction of HER3 phosphorylation.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The results are consistent with the idea that AKT activation causes feedback inhibition of
HER kinase expression, especially of HER3, which, when phosphorylated docks with and
activates PI3K. The induction of HER3 in response to AKT inhibition is associated with an
increase in HER2-HER3 heterodimers and leads to increased HER3 phosphorylation. HER3
phosphorylation is blocked by the HER1/2 kinase inhibitor Lapatinib, but the increase in
HER3 expression is not. This finding suggests that the increase in HER3 expression is in
large part responsible for the observed increase in phosphorylation.
HER3 expression is induced by inhibitors of PI3K or AKT or by knockdown of AKT. That
induction of HER3 expression and phosphorylation in response to AKT inhibition represents
release of AKT-dependent feedback inhibition of the pathway is supported by the
downregulation of HER3 expression that occurs when the AKT inhibitor is washed out of
cells. We used phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase arrays to ask whether AKT-induced
negative feedback was confined to HER3 or involved other receptors as well. We found that,
although HER3 induction was very prominent, the phosphorylation of multiple other
receptors was induced as well. Induction of receptor phosphorylation was not confined to
HER2-dependent breast cancers, it occurred in tumor cells derived from all lineages tested
(breast, prostate, ovary, lung, melanoma). We identified a set of nine RTKs whose
phosphorylation is commonly induced after AKT inhibition. Four of these (HER3, IGF1R,
Insulin receptor, and EphA7) responded in almost all cells tested.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Phosphorylated HER3 has a high capacity and affinity for PI3K, docking it to the
membrane. The most obvious physiologic role of PI3K-AKT signaling is mediating the
effects of the Insulin and IGF1 receptors. It seems from our data that these three receptors
are coordinately feedback downregulated by AKT when the pathway is activated. AKT
inhibition induces the expression as well as the phosphorylation of HER3, IGF1R, and
Insulin receptors. Induction of other kinases such as RET and HER4 is confined to
phosphorylation; expression is typically unaffected. HER2 is the dominant activated kinase
in breast cancers in which it is amplified and, in these tumors, the induction of
phosphorylation of the other RTKs is HER2 dependent. Lapatinib blocks their
phosphorylation, but not the induction of expression of IGF1R and IR. Previous work by
other labs has demonstrated that IGF1R and Insulin receptor kinases are not antagonized by
Lapatinib at doses as high as 3μM and the lack of effect of Lapatinib upon IGF1R and
Insulin receptor in non-HER2 driven models like H1975 (Fig. S3) supports that the activity
seen here is not due to direct inhibition of those kinases. Whether the HER-kinase
dependence of induction of IGF-1R/insulin receptor phosphorylation represents
transphosphorylation of these kinases by HER2 or a HER2 dependent activation of

autophosphorylation is under investigation. Activation of IGF1-R and Insulin receptor by
AKT inhibition does involve both induction of expression and HER-kinase dependent
phosphorylation of these kinases. In the non-small cell lung cancer model H292, the
induction of phosphorylation of some RTKs like HER3 is HER kinase inhibitor sensitive.
Others, such as FGFR and IGF1R are insensitive. It is clear that activation of AKT in tumors
induces a complex and broad pattern of feedback inhibition of RTKs that is relieved by
inhibition of AKT.
TORC1 inhibition by rapamycin has also been shown to activate signaling and less selective
PI3K inhibitors that target both mTORC1 and PI3K have been shown to induce HER3
expression (Amin et al., 2010; Sergina et al., 2007). We asked whether AKT inhibition
activated signaling via inhibition of mTORC1. Rapamycin partially reproduced the effects
of AKT inhibition, inducing the phosphorylation of HER3 along with several other RTKs.
However, induction of HER3 was considerably weaker than that observed with AKT
inhibition and the phosphorylation of most of the RTKs induced by AKT inhibition was
unaffected by rapamycin. The differences between the effects of the AKT inhibitor and
rapamycin suggest that there are AKT-regulated feedback pathways that are not mediated by
TORC1.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A clue to the nature of these pathways came from studies on the mechanism of induction of
expression of HER3, IGF1R and insulin receptor. AKT inhibition results in marked
induction of the mRNAs encoding these receptors, whereas rapamycin has either no or
marginal effects. AKT has been shown to phosphorylate the FOXO family of transcription
factors and thereby prevent their nuclear translocation, thus inhibiting their function (Brunet
et al., 1999). We show that AKT inhibition recruits FOXO proteins to the HER3 promoter
and that FOXO1/3/4 knockdown with siRNA suppresses the induction of IGF1-R/IR/HER3
expression and phosphorylation. We note that the knockdown of FOXO proteins has little
effect on the basal expression of the RTKs. We postulate that in these cells with activated
PI3K/AKT signaling, FOXOs are effectively inhibited and expression of HER3, IGF1R and
IR are dependent on other factors in this state. However, AKT inhibition results in activation
of these transcription factors enabling them to promote RTK expression. We thus conclude
that AKT regulates the expression of these receptors by inhibiting FOXO-dependent
transcription.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We propose the following model based on our current understanding to explain the
regulation of PI3K-AKT signaling by negative feedback in tumors and how it is affected by
targeted drugs (Fig. 8). Receptor activation of PI3K-AKT causes AKT-dependent
phosphorylation of FOXO proteins which downregulate the expression of some of the
receptors that are tightly coupled to PI3K, including HER3, IGF1R and insulin receptor. In
addition, AKT activation leads to activation of TORC1 and S6K which feedback inhibits
IRS1 expression and other undefined regulators of receptor signaling. The result is
downmodulation of the signal.
Therapeutic inhibition of different components of the pathway reactivates feedback, but by
mechanisms specific to the inhibited target (Fig. 8). Thus, AKT inhibition will result in
activation of FOXO-dependent transcription of receptors and inhibition of S6K-dependent
inhibition of signaling with resultant activation of multiple receptors. The downstream
effects of AKT will be suppressed, but other RTK driven signaling pathways will be
activated. In contrast, TORC1 inhibition blocks S6K-dependent feedback, activates IGF and
HER kinases but not their expression and thus activates both AKT and ERK signaling.
These findings have important basic and therapeutic implications. The enhancement of
signaling by autocrine activation or mutation of RTKs that activate PI3K-AKT signaling

would be expected to be limited by negative feedback. Selection of oncogenes that encode
proteins that overcome or are unresponsive to feedback would be favored (e.g. activating
mutation in PI3K or loss of PTEN). All drugs that inhibit components of dysregulated
mitogenic signaling pathways would be expected to relieve feedback inhibition of other
components of the signaling network. This may reduce the antitumor effects of the drug, but
also ameliorate toxicity. Combined inhibition of the oncoprotein and key pathways
reactivated by inhibition of negative feedback should have enhanced antitumor activity. This
is consistent with our finding that the AKT inhibitor causes tumor regressions when
combined with low doses of HER kinase or HSP90 inhibitors that prevent or attenuate
induction of receptor phosphorylation. Whether effective inhibition of both PI3K-AKT
signaling and feedback reactivated pathways will have an enhanced therapeutic index will
have to be evaluated in clinical trials.

Experimental Procedures
Reagents

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

AKTi-1/2 and AKTi-1/2/3 (MK-2206) were from Merck; both drugs were dissolved in
DMSO for in vitro studies. For in vivo studies, AKTi-1/2 was dissolved in 25%
hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin (pH 4–5), and administered subcutaneously while AKTi-1/2/3
was dissolved in 30% Capitisol and administered by oral gavage. A detailed list of other
reagents utilized is provided in supplemental procedures.
Immunoblotting
Lysates from cells in culture were prepared by washing twice in cold PBS followed by lysis
with either SDS-lysis buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, (pH7.4) 2% SDS) or RIPA-lysis buffer
supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Pierce Chemical). For
immunoprecipitations, cells were lysed with NP40-lysis buffer ([50 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4),
1% NP40, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 40 mmol/L NaF) supplemented with protease and
phosphatase inhibitors (Pierce Chemical). For lysis in SDS, lysates were boiled for 5
minutes followed by brief sonication. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000×g
(10min) and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentration of each sample was
determined using the BCA kit (Pierce) per manufacturer’s instructions. 25 or 50 μg protein
was loaded onto 6 or 10% SDS-PAGE minigels for immunoblotting. Further details on
immunoprecipitation and cross-linking provided in supplemental procedures.
RT-PCR

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Taqman reactions were done using an ABI 7500 real-time quantitative PCR system. For data
analysis, raw counts were normalized to housekeeping gene average for the same time point
and condition (ΔCt). Counts are reported as fold change relative to the untreated control
(2–ΔΔCt). A list of probes and reagents used are provided in the supplemental procedures.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (MagnaChIP assay kit; Upstate Biotechnology). Approximately
1 × 107 cells were used for each immunoprecipitation. DNA was amplified by PCR using
primer pairs against the HER3 5’ UTR (GPH003183(-)01A from SA Biosciences), IGF-1R
5’ UTR (GPH004604(-)02A), and Insulin receptor 5’ UTR (GPH019975(-)01A) and SYBR
Green reaction mix (SA Biosciences) and product was quantified using an ABI 7500 real
time quantitative PCR system. Reactions were performed in triplicate and the mean
normalized to input chromatin and reported as relative fold enrichment ± SEM.

Animal studies

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

4-6 week old nu/nu athymic BALB/c female mice were obtained from the NCI-Frederick
Cancer Center and maintained in pressurized ventilated caging. All studies were performed
in compliance with institutional guidelines under an IACUC approved protocol
(MSKCC#09-05-009). For efficacy studies, mice with well-established tumors were selected
and randomized approximately fourteen days post-implantation (Size > 200mm3); BT-474
xenograft tumors were established in nude mice by subcutaneously implanting 0.72 mg
sustained release 17β-estradiol pellets with a 10g trocar into one flank followed by injecting
1 × 107 cells suspended 1:1 (volume) with reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel,
Collaborative Research) on the opposite side 3 days afterwards. Mice were treated with
AKTi-1/2, AKTi-1/2/3, Gefitinib, SNX5422, or Lapatinib with the indicated doses. Tumor
dimensions were measured with vernier calipers and tumor volumes calculated (π/6 × larger
diameter × (smaller diameter)2).
RTK arrays
Human Phospho-RTK arrays were utilized according to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly,
cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed in NP40 lysis buffer and 50-250μg of lysates
incubated with blocked membranes overnight. Membranes were subsequently washed and
exposed to chemiluminescent reagent and exposed to x-ray film. Quantification of was
pixels was performed by densitometry using Adobe CS2 and Fuji Film Multi Gauge
software.
Significance

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Constitutive feedback inhibition of upstream signaling pathways is a fundamental feature
of tumors with activated oncoproteins. AKT activation leads to feedback by inhibiting
the nuclear localization of FOXO and other transcription factors and activating mTOR
kinase. The antitumor effects of inhibitors of oncoproteins may be attenuated by relief of
feedback. In tumors with activation of PI3K-AKT signaling, AKT inhibitors activate
receptor signaling and expression by activating FOXO and inhibiting mTORC1. In
contrast, rapamycin inhibits mTORC1, but activates AKT. Thus, inhibitors of different
components of the activated pathway will relieve different aspects of negative feedback.
Effective therapy may require combining signaling inhibitors with inhibitors of the
specific pathways they induce.

(A) BT474 cells were treated with AKTi-1/2 (1μM) and collected at indicated times. AKT
inhibition as measured by loss of S473 phosphorylation, along with AKT targets S6K and
PRAS40, is associated with increases in HER3 and P-HER3. (B) BT-474 cells treated with
siRNAs against AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3 (AKT3 was not detectable) for 72 hours were
collected and lysates immunoblotted demonstrating loss of AKT expression is associated

SK-BR3 were treated with the MEK inhibitor PD325901 (50nM). Inhibition of ERK1/2
phosphorylation was not associated with an induction of HER3 or P-HER3. (D) BT-474 and

The induction of HER3 expression occurred upon AKT inhibition despite the lack of serum.

treated with 1μM AKTi-1/2/3 (24hr) compared to untreated (0hr) demonstrating that
phosphorylation of several receptors is induced with inhibitor treatment. The HER2 and
HER3 dot blots were excised from the membrane in the case of SKBR-3 cell line shown
here. See Supp. Methods for list of receptors corresponding to labels (e.g. B5 = HER3) and
Fig. S2 for other cell lines tested. (B) Listed are the receptors in which average tyrosine
phosphorylation (10 cell lines) induced >2.9 fold after 1μM AKTi-1/2/3 (24hr) as measured
by densitometry on P-RTK arrays. Mean induction and the number of cell lines with an
induction (>1.3) are listed (Cell lines – BT-474, H292, MCF10A, SKBR3, MDA231,
MDA453, LNCAP, H3255, H1975, IGROV1). (C) A panel of 7 non-HER2 amplified cell
lines was treated with 1μM AKTi-1/2/3 and immunoblots demonstrate induction of the
expression of several RTKs. (D) Listed is the fold induction of protein expression of HER3,
Insulin Receptor, and IGF-1R after AKT inhibition calculated by densitometry from
immunoblots. See also Table S1.

Fig. 4. HER kinase inhibition does not block AKTi stimulated RTK expression but can alleviate
AKTi induction of P-RTKs

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A) BT-474 cells were treated with dmso, 1μM AKTi-1/2/3, 1μM Lapatinib, or the
combination. Immunoblots of P-RTK arrays were quantified by densitometry. The effect of
the HER1/2 kinase inhibitor upon the induction caused by AKT inhibition is shown with the
induced expression of most P-RTKs blocked in the combination treatment. (B) NCI-H292
cells were treated with dmso, 1μM AKTi-1/2/3, 5μM Gefitinib, or the combination. The
effect of the HER kinase inhibitor upon the induction caused by the AKTi is shown with the
induced expression of some P-RTKs blocked in the combination treatment. (C) BT-474 cells
were treated with dmso, 1μM AKTi-1/2/3, 1μM Lapatinib, or the combination and collected
at 8 and 24 hours post treatment. Immunoblotting of lysates demonstrates AKTi or Lapatinib
or the combination induces HER3, IGF-1R, and Insulin receptor expression but
phosphorylation of these receptors is blocked by Lapatinib treatment. (D) NCI-H292 cells
were treated with 1μM Lapatinib, 1μM AKTi-1/2/3, or the combination and collected at 4, 8,
or 24 hours post-treatment and lysates immunoblotted showing induction HER3 and PHER3 in response to AKT inhibition and blockade of HER3 phosphorylation by Lapatinib.

Fig. 5. Inhibition of AKT but not mTORC1 promotes the expression and phosphorylation of
several RTKs

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A) BT-474 cells were treated with 1μM AKTi-1/2, 50nM Rapamycin, or 500nM Lapatinib
and collected at indicated times. Loss of AKT S473 phosphorylation is associated with an
induction in HER3 protein levels while treatment with Rapamycin is not associated with
significantly increased levels of HER3. (B) BT474 cells were treated with 1μM AKTi-1/2 or
50nM Rapamycin and lysates applied to Phospho-RTK arrays. The HER2 and HER3 dot
blots were excised from the membranes shown here. Densitometry was performed to
calculate fold induction over untreated cells. All receptors induced >1.9 fold are listed. See
also Fig. S4.

Fig. 6. AKT but not mTORC1 inhibition induces RTK RNA expression in a FOXO dependent
manner

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A) BT-474 cells treated with 1μM AKTi-1/2, 50nM Rapamycin, or 500nM Lapatinib and
RT-PCR was performed using reverse transcribed cellular RNA. Fluorescence was
normalized to housekeeping gene expression (β-Actin and GAPDH) and is displayed as the
percentage of the value for untreated lysate. Expression of HER3, IGF-IR, and Insulin
Receptor was induced by effective suppression of activated AKT but minimally with
Rapamycin treatment. (B) BT-474 cells were treated with interfering RNAs against FOXO1
(siF1), FOXO3 (siF3), FOXO4 (siF4), FOXO1 + 3 + 4 (siFall) or mock (M) with or without
AKTi-1/2/3 (1μM). Cells were collected 72 hours post-siRNA transfection (24 hours post
AKTi) and RT-PCR performed with the indicated probes. Inhibition of AKT is associated
with enhanced expression of the HER3, IR, and IGF-1R RNAs. RNA induction is
suppressed by FOXO1/3/4 knockdown. (C) BT-474 cells were treated with FOXO1/3/4
siRNAs or mock for 48 hours followed by treatment with AKTi-1/2/3 (1μM) or DMSO for
24 hours followed by formalin-fixation and isolation of chromatin. Immunoprecipitation was
performed using antibodies against FOXO 1, 3, and 4 and RT-PCR done with
oligonucleotides complementary to a sequence 1kb 5’ to the HER3, INSR, and IGF-1R start
sites. Expression was normalized to the non-immunoprecipitated (input) fraction and
reported as fold enrichment (± SEM) and demonstrate increased binding of FOXO proteins
to the RTK 5’ UTRs upon AKT inhibition. (D) BT-474 cells were treated as in (C) and
collected for immunoblotting demonstrating knockdown of FOXO proteins associated with
diminished induction of the RTKs. See also Fig S5.

Fig. 7. HER1/2 kinase inhibition improves antitumor efficacy when given in combination with
the AKTi

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A) Mice bearing BT-474 tumors were randomized to (1) no treatment, (2) Lapatinib
150mpk 3 times/week, (3) AKTi-1/2 100mpk 3 times/week, or (4) combination of (2) and
(3) and tumor size measured 2x/week with the combination treatment demonstrating
superior antitumor efficacy compared to the single agents. (B) Mice bearing NCI-H292
tumors were randomized to (1) no treatment, (2) Gefitinib (Iressa) 150mpk 3 times/week, (3)
AKTi-1/2/3 100mpk 3 times/week, or (4) combination of (2) and (3) and tumor size
measured by vernier calipers 2x/week with the combination treatment demonstrating
superior antitumor effects to the single agents. The results in (A) and (B) are presented as
the mean tumor volume ± SEM (n = 5 mice/group). (C) Mice (n=12) bearing BT-474
tumors were randomized to no treatment, treatment with a single dose of Lapatinib 150mpk,
AKTi-1/2/3 100mpk, or the combination and collected at 6 and 12 hours post treatment.
Immunoblotting of tumor lysates demonstrates AKT inhibition induces P-HER3 and PIGF-1R/INSR in vivo and this is attenuated by Lapatinib coadministration. Note, two mice
treated for the 12 hour time points lacked adequate tumor tissue at retrieval and were
omitted. (D) Mice bearing NCI-H292 tumors were treated with a single dose of Gefitinib
150mpk, AKTi-1/2/3 100mpk, or the combination and collected at 6 and 12 hours post
treatment. Immunoblotting of lysates demonstrates AKT inhibition induces P-HER3 and PIGF-1R/INSR and this is attenuated by Gefitinib coadministration. See also Fig. S6.

Fig. 8. AKT inhibition and mTORC1 inhibition relieve feedback inhibition at unique nodes of
oncogenic growth factor signaling pathways

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Depicted in middle panel is the steady state feedback program elicited by activation of AKT
and/or mTORC1. Receptor activation stimulates PI3K-AKT activity which inhibits FOXO
mediated activation of RTK transcription. Receptor stimulation also activates mTORC1
which directs inhibitory feedback upon the expression of IRS-1, thereby attenuating PI3KAKT activity. In the left panel, Rapamycin blocks mTORC1 action, relieving the feedback
inhibition upon IRS-1 and causing hyperactivation of PI3K-AKT signaling. In the right
panel, AKT inhibition blocks both AKT and the downstream mTORC1. The consequence is
to relieve mTORC1 feedback but also to activate FOXO driven transcription of RTKs and
stimulate PI3K-AKT activity through higher RTK expression and activity.
