BACKGROUND. Increased levels of chromogranin A (CgA), a protein secreted by
many neuroendocrine cells, have been detected in sera of patients with neuroendocrine tumors or renal, hepatic, or heart failure. In patients with heart failure,
serum CgA correlates with tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF) and soluble TNF receptors (sTNF-Rs), with important prognostic implications. The prognostic value of
CgA and sTNF-Rs was investigated in advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer
(NSCLC), a histologically heterogeneous group of tumors that may undergo neu1

roendocrine differentiation.

METHODS. CgA and sTNF-Rs were analyzed in the sera of 88 patients with NSCLC
before chemotherapy by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA) and in
tumors by immunohistochemistry.

between CgA expression in tumors and serum levels. Conversely, circulating CgA
was associated with worse Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) (P 5 .0005), more advanced stage (P 5 .042), and survival,
with CgA being an independent prognostic factor of poor outcome (hazards ratio
[HR] 1.31 for 100 ng/mL increase; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.08–1.60
[P 5 .0071]). sTNF-R1 and sTNF-R2 were also associated with ECOG PS
(P 5 .0001 and P 5 .02, respectively). sTNF-Rs was weakly correlated with circulating CgA (r 5 0.39 for TNF-R1 and r 5 0.40 for TNF-R2), suggesting a regulatory link between sTNF-Rs and CgA secretion.

CONCLUSIONS. Increased serum levels of CgA in NSCLC are independent from
protein expression in tumors and more likely related to neuroendocrine response
associated with worsening of patient condition. In addition to ECOG PS and
stage, CgA is an independent indicator of poor prognosis. Cancer 2007;110:845–

hromogranin A (CgA) is an acidic glycoprotein belonging to a
family of regulated secretory proteins stored in the dense core
granules of the adrenal medulla and of many other neuroendocrine
cells and neurons.1–3 Detection of CgA in tumor tissue is widely
used for histopathologic analysis of neuroendocrine tumors as well
as for assessing neuroendocrine differentiation of nonneuroendocrine tumors.4–6 For example, focal expression of CgA antigen in
tumor tissues has been used to assess neuroendocrine differentiation in breast, prostate and nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC).7–12

Moreover, circulating CgA is a sensitive marker for
diagnosis of various types of neuroendocrine tumors
and an independent prognostic indicator of mortality
in patients with carcinoid tumors.3 Elevated levels of
circulating CgA have been detected in the blood of
patients with hepatic failure or renal failure,3,13 and
in patients with atrophic gastritis (type 1) and those
receiving treatment with proton pump inhibitors.14–16
In addition, we have recently shown that circulating
CgA is markedly increased in patients with heart
failure, depending on the severity of the diseases,
and that it correlates with tumor necrosis factor-a
(TNF) and soluble TNF receptors (sTNF-Rs) with
important prognostic implications.17,18 This suggests
that CgA may be associated not only with neuroendocrine tumors, but also with other inflammatory
diseases or disabling medical conditions characterizing organ failure.
In this study, we analyzed CgA and soluble TNF
receptors in patients with NSCLC, a disabling disease
with variable clinical behavior. Because it has been
previously shown that chemotherapy with cisplatin
and other chemotherapeutic agents is associated with
an increase of plasma CgA,19,20 we analyzed CgA in
serum samples before chemotherapy. We demonstrated that the circulating levels of CgA are increased
in a subpopulation of patients with NSCLC, despite a
lack of detectable CgA in tumor tissue, and are correlated with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status (PS), extension of the disease, and, weakly, with sTNF-Rs. Furthermore, we
demonstrated that CgA is an independent negative
prognostic indicator of mortality.

carcinoma of the skin or other malignancies treated
5 years previously without evidence of recurrence.
Patients with clinical or conventional laboratory
evidence suggestive of hypertension; rheumatoid arthritis; or heart, hepatic, or renal failure, were excluded
from this study.
TNM classification was based on the new international staging system.21 The staging procedures
included clinical examination, computed tomography
(CT) scan of the chest and abdomen, or abdominal
ultrasonography. Brain CT scan and bone scanning
were performed according to symptom presentation
or other clinical indications.
After blood collection patients were treated
according to their stage, ECOG PS, and comorbidities
with best supportive care, chemotherapy, or chemoradiotherapy. Follow-up was performed every 2 months
with baseline staging procedures.
The study protocol was revised and accepted by
the local ethics committee and appropriate written
informed consent was obtained from each patient
before entering the study. Recommendations of the
Declaration of Helsinki for biomedical research involving human subjects were also followed.

Controls
Blood samples of age-matched healthy donors were
collected as controls.
Blood Collection and Storage
Five mL of peripheral blood was collected before any
treatment in a sterile testtube (without anticoagulants) and centrifuged at 3000g for 10 minutes at
48C. Serum was stocked in 0.5-mL aliquots in cryovials and stored at 2808C until measurement was
performed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility
Patients with histologically proven, untreated, and
locally advanced unresectable or metastatic NSCLC
were eligible for participation in the study. Additional
eligibility criteria included age >18 years, a white
blood cell count 3.5 3 109/L, a platelet count 100
3 109/L, hemoglobin of 9 g/dL, an absolute granulocyte count >2.0 3 109/L, bilirubin <1.5-fold the upper
limit of normal (ULN), prothrombin time or activated partial thromboplastin time <1.5-fold greater
than controls, alanine aminotransferase or aspartate
aminotransferase <3-fold the ULN (elevated to 5-fold
in patients with known hepatic metastases), and a
calculated creatinine clearance rate of >45 mL/min.
Patients were ineligible if they had evidence of
prior/concurrent malignancy other than in situ carcinoma of the cervix or adequately treated basal cell

CgA, sTNF-R1, and sTNF-R2 Assays
CgA assay was performed by sandwich enzymelinked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA) based on an
anti-CgA monoclonal antibody (B4E11) and a rabbitpolyclonal anti-CgA antiserum. Monoclonal antibody
(MoAb) B4E11 is a mouse immunoglobulin (Ig) G1
that recognizes an epitope of CgA corresponding to
residues 68–70 of human CgA.22 The assay was performed as previously described.18 sTNF-R1 and
sTNF-R2 were measured by sandwich ELISA using
commercial kits from R&D Systems (Abingdon, UK)
Immunohistochemical Analysis of CgA
Immunohistochemical analysis of CgA was performed on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded
surgical specimens and bronchial biopsies (3–4 lm
sections). Sections were deparaffinized in xylene and

rehydrated through graded alcohol steps. Each slide
was treated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in 95%
methanol for 7 minutes to quench endogenous peroxidase activity and washed with water for 10 minutes. Antigen retrieval was performed by microwaving in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) (700 watts for
5 minutes for 4 cycles). After gradual cooling to
room temperature, the slides were washed with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 5 minutes and
blocked with universal serum blocking reagent (Vectastain Universal Quick Kit; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif) for 10 minutes at room temperature.
Detection of CgA was performed using the monoclonal antibody LK2H10 (BioGenex, San Ramon, Calif)
diluted 1:100, followed by detection using the Vectastain Kit. CgA immunostaining was considered positive if cytoplasmic staining was present in >1% of
tumor cells. All specimens were evaluated independently by 2 pathologists without knowledge of pathologic or clinical data concerning the patients under
investigation. A minimum of 10 fields was screened
(340 objective lens).

Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as the median value, interquartile
range (Q1-Q3), and minimum and maximum values
for continuous variable, absolute and relative frequencies for categoric variables. The distributions of
the serum levels of CgA, TNF-R1, and TNF-R2 were
compared between cases and controls by means of
the Wilcoxon test. The same test (or the KruskalWallis test in case of >2 categories) was applied to
compare the same parameters in groups defined by
clinical characteristics, such as stage and histologic
type. A nonparametric test for trend was used to
assess the presence of a monotonic trend of CgA,
TNF-R1, and TNF-R2 serum levels according to PS.
The capability of CgA serum levels to discriminate between cases and controls was assessed by
means of Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC)
curves. The relations between serum levels were
assessed using Spearman correlation coefficients,
adjusting for group (controls and NSCLC patients).
Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival were compared using the Mantel-Cox version of the log-rank
test.
Overall survival was defined as the time from the
date of pathologic diagnosis to death for any cause;
patients known to still be alive were censored at the
time of the analysis. All P-values are 2-sided and statistical significance was defined as P < .05. Analyses
were performed using SAS software (version 8.20;
SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Patients Characteristics
Eighty-eight consecutive patients with untreated and
locally advanced unresectable or metastatic NSCLC
as well as 50 controls were included in the study.
The median age was 62.5 years (range, 21–80 years)
and 83% of the patients were males. ECOG PS was
generally good (0 in 18%, 1 in 67%, and 2–1 in 15%
of patients). All patients had advanced NSCLC (33%
with stage IIIB disease and 67% with stage IV disease), with bone representing the main metastatic
site. Histologic types were adenocarcinoma (25%),
squamous carcinoma (31%), large cell carcinoma
(11%), and NSCLC not otherwise specified (cytologic
diagnosis) (33%).
Seven patients were treated with proton pump
inhibitors. Patients with advanced disease (n 5 60)
were treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy or
single-agent (gemcitabine, vinorelbine, or taxanes)
therapy. Eight patients received supportive care only
due to the general conditions and/or comorbidities.
Eighteen patients (30%) obtained a partial response,
whereas stable and progressive disease rates were
32% and 38%, respectively, with no important differences noted in response between different chemotherapy regimens. Seven patients of 21 with locally
advanced NSCLC without pleural effusion at the time
of diagnosis or disease progression after 2 to 3 cycles
of chemotherapy received radiotherapy (60–65 grays).

CgA Serum Levels
CgA levels were measured in sera samples obtained
before treatment with chemotherapeutic agents. The
distribution of serum CgA levels in patients is
reported in Table 1. The median value of CgA in
NSCLC patients and controls were 70.4 ng/mL (Q1–
Q3: 37.9–114.6 ng/mL) and 77.4 ng/mL (Q1–Q3:
57.7–99.9 ng/mL), respectively, with no statistically
significant difference noted (Wilcoxon test, Z 5 0.88;
P 5 .377). Moreover, CgA values were not differently
distributed by histologic types: excluding patients
with unspecified NSCLC, median values of CgA were
59.2 ng/mL (Q1–Q3: 35.2–85.6 ng/mL) in patients
with adenocarcinoma, 80.0 ng/mL (Q1–Q3: 41–128.6
ng/mL) in patients with squamous carcinoma, and
82.1 ng/mL (Q1–Q3: 33.7–124 ng/mL) in patients
with large cell carcinoma (Kruskal-Wallis test,
v2 5 1.53; 2 df [P 5 .465]).
Serum CgA levels significantly increased with
worsening of ECOG PS: 37.7 ng/mL (Q1–Q3: 27.2–
68.6 ng/mL) in patients with a PS of 0, 76.3 ng/mL
(Q1–Q3: 43.6–119.2 ng/mL) in patients with a PS of
1, and 102.8 ng/mL (Q1–Q3: 55.8–259.4 ng/mL) in

v2 5 12.03; 1 df [P 5 .0005]).
CgA increased also depending on the extension
of disease. The median CgA values of patients with
stage IIIB and stage IV disease were 44.9 ng/mL
(Q1–Q3 29.2–85.6 ng/mL) and 82.5 ng/mL (Q1–Q3:
47.1–119.2 ng/mL), respectively (Wilcoxon test,
Z 5 22.03 [P 5 .042]). It is noteworthy that the
group with the highest values of CgA did not correspond to patients treated with proton pump inhibitors (n 5 7 patients).
To examine the discriminating capability of CgA
serum levels, we performed ROC analyses contrasting controls and patients affected by NSCLC. The
serum CgA levels failed to differentiate between
controls and NSCLC group (AUC 5 0.457), as shown
in Figure 1.

sTNF-R1 Serum Levels
The distribution of serum TNF-R1 levels in patients
and controls is reported in Table 2. The values in
NSCLC patients were significantly higher than in
controls (Wilcoxon test, Z 5 29.12 [P < .0001]). Median values were 0.72 ng/mL (Q1–Q3: 0.63–0.87 ng/

1.33–2.52 ng/mL) in the patient group. In the NSCLC
group, the values were not differently distributed

The distribution of serum TNF-R2 levels in patients
and controls is reported in Table 2. The values in
NSCLC patients were significantly higher than in
controls (Wilcoxon test, Z 5 24.11 [P < .0001]). The
median values were 1.68 ng/mL (Q1–Q3: 1.46–1.92
ng/mL) in the control group and 2.17 ng/mL (Q1–
Q3: 1.72–3.25 ng/mL) in the patient group. In the
NSCLC group, values were not differently distributed
according to histotype (Kruskal-Wallis test, v2 5 4.14;
2 df [P 5 .126]) or stage (Wilcoxon test, Z 5 21.61
[P 5 .107]), whereas they significantly increased with
worsening of ECOG PS (nonparametric test for trend,
v2 5 5.38; 1 df [P 5 .020]).

Correlation Among Variables
Analysis of correlation among variables showed that
sTNF-R1 and sTNF-R2 correlated closely (r 5 0.82;
95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.75–0.86). Both
receptors weakly correlated with CgA levels (r 5 0.39
[95% CI, 0.24–0.52] for TNF-R1 and r 5 0.40 [95% CI,
0.25–0.53] for TNF-R2). For the other assessed variables such as gender, age, weight loss, and comorbidities (diabetes mellitus, arteriosclerosis, systemic
arterial hypertension, deep vein thrombosis), no statistically significant association was detected.

CgA Expression in Tumor Tissues
The expression of CgA antigen in tumor tissue sections, obtained from bronchial biopsies or from surgical specimens of 10 patients with different CgA
serum levels, was analyzed using the anti-CgA monoclonal antibody LK2H10. No correlation between serum levels and tissue expression was observed (Table
3). Of note, no expression of CgA was observed in a
section corresponding to the patient with the highest
serum level of CgA (724 ng/mL). Moreover, 2 patients

with focal neuroendocrine differentiation, as suggested by the presence of 2% and 7%, respectively,
CgA-positive cells in tissue sections, had low serum
CgA levels (Table 3) (Fig. 2). These results suggest
that tumor tissues are not the major source of circulating CgA in NSCLC patients.

Survival Analysis
At a median follow-up time of 44.3 months, 86
patients (97.7%) had died. The median survival of
the entire group was 7.5 months (Q1–Q3: 3.1–16.4
months). Univariate analysis showed that CgA, TNFR1, TNF-R2, ECOG PS, and stage were all associated
with survival (Table 4). Given that all these parameters were associated with a higher probability of
dying, they were included in a multivariate model.
Multivariate analysis indicated that CgA is a relevant
independent prognostic factor of a poor outcome
(hazards ratio [HR], 1.31; 95% CI, 1.08–1.60 [P 5 .0071])
in addition to TNM and ECOG PS (Table 4).
To describe the survival in relation to CgA and
soluble TNF-Rs levels, Kaplan-Meier curves were
drawn using the following cutoffs: CgA < 77 ng/mL
(corresponding to the median value of the distribution in controls), CgA > 156 ng/mL (derived from
ROC curves as the value with the best discriminative
capacity), TNF-R1  1.5 ng/mL, and TNF-R2  2.0
ng/mL (from ROC curves) (Fig. 3). The median survival was 12.0 months in patients with CgA levels
 77 ng/mL, 5.8 months in those with CgA > 77 and
 156 ng/mL, and 2.1 months in those with CgA
> 156 ng/mL. Considering the group with CgA

CgA levels were detected before chemotherapy. At
follow-up, among the 60 patients treated with chemotherapeutic drugs we found 18 (30.0%) partial
responses, 19 (31.7%) with stable disease and 23
(38.3%) with disease progression. When we compared the response of patients with CgA levels
greater than the median of normal values (n 5 23)
with those of patients with lower levels (n 5 37), we
found 3 partial responses (13%), 7 cases of stable disease (30.4%), and 13 patients with disease progression (56.5%) in the first group, and 15 partial
responses (40.5%), 12 cases of stable disease (32.4%),
and 10 patients with disease progression (27%) in the
second group, with no statistically significant difference (P 5 .38).

The results of the current study demonstrate that serum CgA and sTNF-Rs are increased in a subpopulation of NSCLC, independently from CgA expression
in tumors, before administration of cisplatin or other
chemotherapeutic drugs. Although the median values
of CgA in normal subjects and in patients were similar (mean of 77 ng/mL and 70 ng/mL, respectively)
the distribution ranges were different (28–196 ng/mL

and 9–724 ng/mL, respectively). Thirteen percent of
patients had CgA values greater than the highest
value observed in normal subjects, whereas few
patients had CgA levels lower than the lowest value
observed in normal subjects, possibly due to reduced
production or increased degradation of CgA. Increased
levels of CgA have been observed also by other investigators in a subset of NSCLC patients.23,24
The source of serum CgA and sTNF-Rs in
patients with NSCLC and the pathophysiologic
meaning of increased levels are unknown. Abnormal
levels of circulating CgA have been detected in various nonneoplastic conditions, such as heart failure,
renal failure, hepatic failure, and hypertension.3,25
We exclude that high levels of CgA in NSCLC patients
were related to these conditions, because these
patients were excluded from our study. Furthermore,
the majority of patients in the current study (>92%)
were not receiving treatment with proton pump inhibitors, which are known to induce CgA release in circulation,14–16 except for a small number of subjects
(n 5 7) that in any case did not correspond to
patients with the highest levels.
In patients with prostate cancer with neuroendocrine differentiation, a correlation between CgA-producing cells in tumor tissue sections and CgA serum
levels has been observed.26 This suggests that the tumor itself may be a source of circulating CgA. In
NSCLC, the experimental data so far available
appears to argue against this hypothesis. Previous
work showed that approximately 30% to 50% of
patients with NSCLC have elevated serum levels of
CgA compared with controls.23 However, other work
performed by many groups demonstrated that only
0% to 19% of patients with NSCLC have focal expression of CgA in tumor tissues, as judged from the
results of immunohistochemical studies.27–29 Another
study, conducted in 90 patients with advanced
NSCLC, showed that CgA is expressed in tumors
even less frequently.30 It would appear, therefore,
that patients with increased serum levels of CgA are
more common than patients with tissue expression
of this protein. Accordingly, when we analyzed the
expression of CgA in tumor tissues sections of
patients with different levels of circulating CgA, we
observed CgA expression in 2 samples with relatively
low levels of circulating CgA, but not in samples
from patients with high serum levels. Of note, negative samples included those from patients with very
high levels of circulating CgA. Thus, no correlation
between tissue expression, as judged from mAb
LK2H10 staining of tissue sections, and serum levels
seems to occur in NSCLC. Interestingly, circulating
CgA was associated with worse patient ECOG PS and

more advanced NSCLC, suggesting that increased circulating levels of CgA are more likely related to worse
general patient conditions than to neuroendocrine
differentiation.
A previous study provided evidence to suggest
that circulating CgA bears important information
related to prognosis for NSCLC patients.24 Accordingly, we observed that patients with relatively high
levels of CgA had worse survival. However, we also
found that the prognostic value of CgA was independent of ECOG PS and stage.
The observation that serum CgA is an indicator
of mortality in NSCLC independent from stage and
ECOG PS raises the question as to whether CgA
could contribute to tumor progression or is just a
measurable surrogate marker of conditions associated with worse outcome. We have shown previously that local expression of CgA in mammary
adenocarcinoma or lymphoma tumors delays, rather
than promotes, the growth of tumors in mouse models.31 However, it is difficult to speculate on the effect
of CgA on tumor progression in NSCLC patients on
the basis of these results (obtained with tumor cells
engineered to secrete CgA) because the cellular
source of circulating CgA, its local concentration,
and its posttranslational modifications are likely different in patients. Interestingly, CgA was associated
with both sTNF-R1 and sTNF-R2. Although sTNF-Rs
were not significant independent prognostic factors
of poor survival, they were also significantly associated with ECOG PS. This raises again the question
as to whether sTNF-Rs in concert with CgA play a
pathophysiologic role in NSCLC. It is believed that
endogenous TNF can regulate tumor physiology by
affecting cancer cell proliferation and survival,
inflammatory and immune responses, angiogenesis,
vascular function, and stroma formation.32–34
Because of its complex activity, TNF may contribute
to reduced or even to increased tumor growth,35,36
likely depending on its site of production, its levels
in tumor tissues, and its persistence, as well as the
presence or absence of other cytokines in tumors.
Soluble TNF-Rs can act as inhibitors of TNF interaction with membrane receptors, or conversely as
molecules capable of prolonging its activity, eg, by
stabilizing its bioactive homotrimeric structure.33,37
Thus, it is very difficult to speculate on the overall
effects of both sTNF-Rs and CgA on tumor progression in patients with NSCLC. However, it should be
kept in mind that the effects of TNF and CgA are
most likely not limited to tumors. Considering that 1
of the known effects of TNF is to affect vascular permeability and that CgA can inhibit TNF-induced vascular leakage in normal vessels,38 sTNF-Rs in concert

with CgA could contribute to reducing some of the
potentially dangerous effects of pathologic levels of
circulating TNF on the vascular system in different
organs. It is noteworthy that in the present study we
observed a significant correlation between circulating
sTNF-Rs and CgA, as we observed previously in
patients with heart failure.17,18 This supports the
hypothesis that a regulatory link exists between CgA
and sTNF-Rs secretion that may contribute to control the activity of TNF at the systemic level.
Based on these considerations, we hypothesize
that circulating CgA in NSCLC is not just a marker of
neuroendocrine differentiation, but it reflects stressrelated systemic neuroendocrine activation associated with worsening conditions, also characterized
by the release of potentially dangerous cytokines in
circulation.
In conclusion, we found that serum sTNF-Rs and
CgA are increased in a subpopulation of patients
with NSCLC, despite a lack of detectable CgA in tumor tissue. CgA correlates with PS, stage, sTNF-R1
and sTNF-R2, and is an independent prognostic indicator of mortality. The lack of correlation with CgA
expression in tissues and the correlation with sTNFRs suggests that CgA in certain cancer patients is
more likely related to the worse general patient conditions, rather than to neuroendocrine differentiation.
