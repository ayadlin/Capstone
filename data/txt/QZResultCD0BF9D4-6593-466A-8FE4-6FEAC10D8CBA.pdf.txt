ABSTRACT
Introduction: There are few effective treatment options for leptomeningeal
metastasis (LM) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study assessed the
feasibility of high-dose gefitinib in patients with LM from NSCLC harboring EGFR
mutations or prior systemic response to EGFR-TKI.
Methods: This phase I open-label trial of a novel gefitinib dosing schedule
employed a 3+3 design. Eligible NSCLC patients with LM had known EGFR mutations
and/or prior response to EGFR-TKI. Patients alternated 2 weeks of high-dose daily
gefitinib (dose levels: 750 mg, 1000 mg, 1250 mg) with 2 weeks of maintenance
therapy (500 mg daily). Primary endpoints were safety and toxicity. Secondary
endpoints included overall survival (OS), neurological progression-free survival,
radiological response, and cytological response in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
Results: Seven patients were treated: 3 at 750 mg dose level, 4 at 1000 mg dose
level. There were no DLTs at the 750 mg dose level, and one DLT (toxic epidermal
necrolysis) at the 1000 mg dose level. The study was closed due to slow accrual.
Median neurological PFS was 2.3months (range 1.6–4.0 months); median OS was
3.5months (range 1.6–5.1months). Though there were no radiologically documented
remissions of LM disease, four patients had improvement in neurological symptoms.
One patient cleared their CSF of NSCLC cells, while 2 others had decrease in malignant
cells in CSF.
Conclusion: Although the MTD was not defined due to slow accrual, this study
provides important information about the tolerability and CSF penetration of highdose gefitinib as a therapeutic option for modest palliation for NSCLC patients with
LM and a known EGFR mutation.

BACKGROUND

mutation in systemic sites but no such resistance mutation
in the CNS metastases [17, 20].
Based on that experience, we postulated that pulsed
doses of a higher dose of gefitinib might be an effective
therapy for leptomeningeal metastases. We have conducted
a prospective phase I trial of high-dose gefitinib therapy for
LM in NSCLC patients with known EGFR mutations and/
or a prior response to an EGFR-TKI. Based on the original
gefitinib phase I studies of continuous daily dosing [21–24],
doses up to 600 mg/day were generally well tolerated,
without dose limiting toxicities. While grade 3 and 4
toxicities did increase at doses ≥ 700 mg/d, the majority
of adverse effects were reversible with dose reduction or
cessation. Moreover, in the two studies that included planned
dose escalation to 1000 mg/d, doses of 1000 mg/d were
administered to 17 patients [21, 25]. Eight of these patients
suffered dose-limiting toxicities: all eight experienced grade
3 diarrhea, with 3 cases of grade 3 rash. However, there were
no grade 4 toxicities reported at the 1,000 mg/d dose level.
Because the time to peak plasma levels for gefitinib is
7–10 days [26], we had treated our previously reported patient
with an alternation of 14 days of increased drug dosage
followed by 14 days of a 500 mg daily maintenance dose.
This allows for 4–7 days of peak plasma levels at the higher
dose, while trying to prevent or minimize any dose-related
toxicity. By alternating periods of high dose and periods of
maintenance therapy in our previously described patient, we
had been able to administer gefitinib in doses as high as 1250
mg daily, achieving therapeutic benefit while minimizing
somnolence and other toxicities that were observed in
previous phase I studies [17]. Therefore, we embarked on
a phase I study employing this strategy in NSCLC patients
with LM and either a known sensitizing EGFR mutation
and/or a history of prior response to an EGFR-TKI.

Leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) represents a grave
development in patients with lung cancer. Lung cancer
is one of the most common solid tumors to metastasize
to the leptomeninges, accounting for ~13–29% of LM
from solid tumors [1–4]. In the largest case series of
patients with LM from solid tumors and lymphoma
(N = 155), the patients with LM from lung cancer
(N = 20) had a median survival of only 1.8 months, lower
than any other histopathologic subgroup [2]. Moreover,
therapeutic options in patients with LM are limited. While
intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy has been beneficial for
patients with leptomeningeal spread of lymphoma or breast
cancer [5, 6], the currently available intrathecal agents
(methotrexate, cytarabine, thiotepa) have limited antitumor
activity in lung cancer [7]. In a randomized trial of IT
methotrexate vs. IT thiotepa in patients with LM, the median
survival for the 12 lung cancer patients with LM was only
8 weeks, compared with a median survival of 15 weeks
for the 40 patients in the study with other non-leukemic
malignancies besides lung cancer [8]. The identification of
an effective treatment for leptomeningeal metastasis in lung
cancer patients would be a welcome therapeutic advance.
The use of adequate concentrations of an epidermal
growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFRTKI) may be one therapeutic possibility. In patients whose
tumor harbors a sensitizing EGFR mutation, systemic
response rates to therapy with gefitinib or erlotinib range
from 60–90% [9–13]. Moreover, the ability to cause
regression of brain metastases in patients with non-small cell
lung cancer and EGFR mutations has been well described
[14–16], suggesting that the agent does have adequate
penetration into the CNS to have antitumor activity.
The development of subsequent LM in patients on
treatment with an EGFR-TKI is felt to be a pharmacokinetic
failure, wherein the penetration of EGFR-TKI into the
cerebrospinal fluid is inadequate to suppress leptomeningeal
tumor involvement. In a previously published case report,
members of our research group had used high doses of
gefitinib when it was still approved for use in the United
States to treat such a NSCLC patient with leptomeningeal
metastases and a known somatic exon 19 deletion mutation
in his tumor EGFR [17]. Gefitinib as a single agent was
increased from 500 mg up to 1250 mg per day over the
course of two months. Over that time, the central nervous
system (CNS) symptoms improved, and cytology from
his cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) no longer showed evidence
of lung cancer cells. With the use of increased dosages of
gefitinib, CSF concentrations of gefitinib were over 40 nM,
exceeding the in vitro IC50 in H3255 and DFCILU-011, two
NSCLC cell lines with sensitizing mutations in the EGFR
[18, 19]. At the time of death, port-mortem studies in this
patient as well as in another patient who had developed
CNS progression after an initial systemic response to
gefitinib showed the development of the T790M resistance

RESULTS
Patient characteristics
Between May 2006 and July 2008, seven patients
with leptomeningeal metastases caused by NSCLC were
enrolled and treated with high-dose gefitinib (Table 1).
Six of the seven patients harbored a known sensitizing
mutation in their tumor EGFR (five exon 19 deletions,
1 L858R mutation); a seventh patient had insufficient
tissue for EGFR mutation analysis but was eligible for
enrollment based on a radiographic response to prior
therapy with an EGFR-TKI; she had received a total of 20
months of vandetanib before developing leptomeningeal
metastases as her primary site of metastasis. All patients
had previously been treated with an EGFR-TKI for a
median of 15.0 months (range 6.7 – 20.4 months) prior
to the diagnosis of leptomeningeal metastases. Of the 6
patients who had evaluable disease outside the central
nervous system at the start of their prior EGFR-TKI
therapy, 5 had a partial response, while the sixth had

stable disease with a minor response. One patient whose
primary tumor harbored an exon 19 deletion had received
a prior EGFR-TKI as maintenance therapy in the setting of
having no evaluable disease; therefore, it was impossible
to assess response to prior EGFR-TKI in that patient.
Three patients had brain metastases at the time
of diagnosis. All three successfully underwent cranial
irradiation for these brain metastases prior to the
diagnosis of LM, with radiation completed 6.2, 17.4,
and 23.2 months prior to development of LM. Three
other patients were treated with cranial irradiation at the
time of diagnosis of LM, completing cranial irradation
2 weeks – 4 months prior to the start of high-dose
gefitinib as part of the therapeutic protocol. The seventh
patient did not receive whole brain radiation therapy
prior to enrollment on this trial, as she did not have CNS
metastases at diagnosis and subsequently developed
leptomeningeal metastases without parenchymal brain
metastases. There was no clear correlation between the
administration or timing of whole brain radiation therapy
and outcomes to high-dose gefitinib.

malignancy and overall debility than to the drug. As
increasing safety data for the concurrent use of low
molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and gefitinib became
available, the prior restriction on anticoagulation was
amended to allow the use of LMWH for deep vein
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Subsequently, one
patient died after a mechanical fall that resulted in a
subdural hematoma while on enoxaparin anticoagulation
for a pulmonary embolism that developed 13 days into his
first cycle of high dose gefitinib.
On the basis of a DLT at the 1000 mg dose level,
that cohort was expanded from 3 to a planned 6 patients.
However, due to slow accrual, only 4 patients were
enrolled on the 1000 mg dose level, and the trial was
subsequently closed to new accrual, despite an absence
of additional DLT’s. On this basis, while a maximum
tolerated dose (MTD) for this gefitinib schedule of
administration was not formally defined, the 750 mg dose
level was well tolerated, without DLT.

Adverse events and determination of a maximum
tolerated dose

Clinical Improvement: All enrolled patients (n = 7)
were assessed for clinical benefit. Four patients – 2 from
the 750 mg dose level and 2 from the 1000 mg dose
level – experienced marked clinical improvements in
neurological signs and symptoms with the introduction of
high-dose gefitinib. These improvements in neurological
examinations were assessed by thorough neurological
exams performed by neuro-oncologists as specified by
the clinical protocol. As objective parameters of clinical
neurologic progression were defined by the protocol (see
Treatments and Assessments, above), the protocol also
prospectively defined objective resolution of previous
neurologic deficits that resulted in improvements in clinical
function and performance status as constituting a clinical
neurologic improvement. Three of these four patients had
exon 19 deletions in their tumor EGFR. The fourth did not
have sufficient tissue for EGFR mutation testing.
Two patients had received prior temozolomide
for their leptomeningeal metastases, for a duration of

Efficacy

All enrolled patients were assessed for toxicities
(Table 2). Diarrhea was the most common drug-related
toxicity (5/7), with one case of grade 3 toxicity. There were no
dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in the gefitinib 750 mg cohort.
There was one DLT in the 1000 mg cohort: after completing
one cycle of therapy, a patient with a pre-existing history of
Sjogren’s syndrome was found to have disease progression in
the CNS and systemically. After stopping the medication for
a few days, she subsequently developed worsening rash that
evolved into a grade 4 toxic epidermal necrolysis; of note,
this patient had the highest measured steady-state plasma
gefitinib concentrations (5094 nM) on this trial. She died of
systemic lung cancer progression 3 weeks later.
In addition to the drug-related toxicities listed,
3 patients developed pulmonary emboli, though these
were felt to be more likely related to their underlying

1 – 2 cycles. Both patients had undergone whole brain
radiation therapy for brain metastases that had been
present at the time of their initial lung cancer diagnosis.
While both of these patients developed progression of
their central nervous system disease and related symptoms
while on temozolomide, they each achieved clinical
improvements in symptoms related to leptomeningeal
metastases while being treated with high-dose gefitinib.
Cytological and Radiological Response: One patient
treated with 1000 mg of gefitinib daily had complete
clearance of lung cancer cells from the CSF after 2
months of therapy as assessed by both cytology in the
hematology laboratory as well as in the cytopathology
laboratory. Two other patients in the trial, one at the 750
mg dose level and the other at 1000 mg dose level, had
some evidence of cytological clearance of malignant cells
from the cerebrospinal fluid: in both of these patients,
one of two independently assessed CSF samples showed
no evidence of malignancy, while the other sample
in each case showed only a few residual tumor cells
(Table 3). These three patients were among the four who
had improvements in clinical findings and symptoms.
None of the seven patients in the trial showed evidence of
radiological resolution of their leptomeningeal metastases
on MRI of the brain and spine.
Progression-free and overall survival: The median
time to neurological progression-free survival from
the time of enrollment was 2.3 months, with a range of
1.6 – 4.0 months. The median overall survival from the
time of trial enrollment was 3.5 months, with a range of
1.6 – 5.1 months.
Steady-state gefitinib concentrations: In patients
treated at the 750 mg dose level, the plasma gefitinib
steady-state concentrations ranged from 1345.8 – 4993.0
nM, while CSF gefitinib concentrations ranged from 14.7
– 54.0 nM. At the 1000 mg dose level, plasma gefitinib

steady-state concentrations ranged from 1552.3 – 5094.4
nM, while CSF concentrations ranged from 17.3 – 143.1
nM. There was no obvious correlation between oral
dose, plasma concentration, or CSF concentration within
the two studied dose levels. Moreover, there was no
correlation between the CSF steady-state concentration
achieved and clinical outcome: the subjects who achieved
clinical improvements or cytological responses included
patients at both the low and high end of the gefitinib
CSF concentration spectrum. However, interpretation of
response is limited since 3 patients never achieved the 40
nM target in CSF and 2 were borderline.

DISCUSSION
Leptomeningeal metastasis often represents a grave
finding in patients with lung cancer, with no consistently
effective treatment options available. Moreover, this
problem may become increasingly common in patients
with EGFR mutations who are being treated with an
EGFR-TKI [31]. First, these patients tend to have longer
overall survival compared with their EGFR wild-type
counterparts, giving them a longer time over which to
develop metastases to the central nervous system: the
median survival for patients with sensitizing EGFR
mutations who are initially treated with an EGFR-TKI is
over 24 months, while overall survival in wild-type patients
has generally been less than a year [13, 32]. Moreover,
there is evidence to suggest a trend towards an increased
risk of LM for patients being treated with an EGFRTKI. In a retrospective study comparing the risk of CNS
progression in patients treated with a first-line EGFR-TKI
vs. chemotherapy, the actuarial risk of LM in the EGFRTKI group was 10% at 24 months, compared with 6% for
the chemotherapy group [33]. A separate retrospective

case series found that 9% of patients with EGFR mutant
tumors and brain metastases would go on to develop
leptomeningeal metastases [34]. Therefore, while this may
seem a narrow population, any potential therapy options
for this patient cohort would be an important advance.
In this trial, we evaluated the use of high-dose
gefitinib, given daily for a 2-week period and then
followed by a 2-week period of lower dose therapy at
500 mg/day. A maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for this
gefitinib schedule of administration was not completely
defined due to slow trial accrual; the narrow eligibility
requirements of development of leptomeningeal
metastasis specifically in patients with known EGFR
mutations limited the available recruitment pool, but
pharmacokinetic and safety data has been generated.
First, while slow accrual prevented formal definition of
the MTD for gefitinib when given in alternating fashion
(2 weeks high-dose, 2 weeks lower dose), the 750 mg
dose level was well-tolerated without any dose limiting
toxicities, and objective improvements were seen at that
dose level. Second, at both the 750 mg and 1000 mg dose
level, there was consistent penetration of gefitinib into the
CSF in concentrations of 14.7 – 143.1 nM, approximating
the known IC50 (40 nM) for gefitinib in EGFR-mutant
cell lines [35]. While a dose-limiting toxicity did arise in
one patient of the four treated at the 1000 mg dose level,
further expansion of the cohort was thwarted by slow
accrual. In future multiple sampling in each patient would
add value in understanding any time dependent changes
in PK profiles. As well time off EGFR TKI for systemic
disease was not captured and may be an important variable
in assess response in future studies.
Finally, four of seven patients had improvements
in clinical symptoms on therapy, with three patients
showing reductions in malignant cells in the CSF. While
improvements in survival were limited, the overall median
survival in this trial (3.5 months) is not as dismal as those
outcomes reported in prior series of patients with LM from
lung cancer [8]. However, the small sample size limits
broad generalization and more studies are needed to fully
assess the value of alternative dosing regimens.
In the absence of other effective treatment options
for LM, it is reasonable for physicians in countries where
gefitinib is clinically available to consider the use of high
dose gefitinib at 750 mg daily for 14 days followed by
500 mg for 14 days for NSCLC patients with LM and a
known sensitizing EGFR mutation. Prior postmortem
examinations suggest that CNS metastases in these
patients will often remain sensitive to EGFR-TKI therapy
[17, 20], and this study demonstrates a consistent ability
to achieve adequate gefitinib CSF concentrations with
this dose and schedule. In general, the current study and
other published reports [36] suggest that the strategy of
high doses of EGFR-TKI’s like gefitinib and erlotinib can
achieve sufficient CSF concentrations to effectively treat
the otherwise ominous development of leptomeningeal
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

metastases. In places where gefitinib is not commercially
available, pulsed high doses of erlotinib have been studied
clinically and might be an alternative consideration [36].
As EGFR mutation testing becomes more widely
employed and more mutation-positive patients are identified
and treated with EGFR-TKI’s, leptomeningeal metastases
in this population may become a more significant clinical
problem. Going forward, it will be interesting to determine
whether response of leptomeningeal metastases may be
more related to peak rather than steady-state concentrations,
area under the curve, or specific genotype/phenotype of
cells in CSF compartment. Resistance mechanisms may
arise including new mutations or clonal selection to name
a few. Additional studies of these strategies to combat or
prevent the development of central nervous system disease
in patients with initial sensitizing mutations in their tumor
EGFR should be considered.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patient selection
This trial was registered with the National Cancer
Institute (clinical trial # NCT00372515). Eligible
patients were ≥ 18 years of age with histologically or
cytologically confirmed non-small-cell lung cancer;
a previously documented somatic EGFR mutation or
documented partial or complete response to prior therapy
with an EGFR-TKI; ECOG performance status 0–3; and
cytologically confirmed leptomeningeal metastases. Other
eligibility criteria included white blood cell count ≥ 3,000/
mL; hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL; platelet count ≥ 80,000/ mL;
creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL; AST, ALT, and total bilirubin ≤ 1.5
times the institutional upper limit of normal; international
normalized ratio ≤ 1.5; and activated thromboplastin time
< 50 seconds. At least 2 weeks must have passed since
prior radiation therapy, and at least 3 weeks must have
passed since prior major surgery. Patients were excluded
for a history of prior gefitinib- or erlotinib-related
toxicity that had led to a dose reduction or interruption;
uncontrolled brain metastases that were associated with
mass effect that would contraindicate lumbar puncture;
history of other malignancy within the past five years,
except for definitively treated non-melanomatous skin
cancers or carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix; a
gastrointestinal disorder that might compromise absorption
of gefitinib; any condition requiring concurrent or ongoing
use of anticoagulation; pregnancy or breastfeeding; or any
severe or unstable medical condition.
Patients were enrolled and treated at the DanaFarber Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General
Hospital in Boston, MA. The study protocol was approved
by the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center institutional
review board, and all patients gave written informed
consent. This study was conducted according to the
Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments.

also felt to be clinically meaningful. Changes in steriod
dosing were noted and accounted for in the neurological
response assessment by the neuro-oncologist.
Prior to starting therapy and at day 14 of each
cycle, investigators collected both blood and CSF for
determination of steady-state gefitinib concentrations
(see below). The collected CSF was also assessed for the
presence of malignant cells. CSF cytology samples from
each time point were sent for independent review to both
the cytology laboratory and the hematology laboratory.
A patient was considered to have cleared their CSF of
malignant cells if independent reviews by cytologists in
both laboratories were deemed negative for malignancy
and at least 2 separate samples.
Radiographic assessments were performed at
baseline and at the completion of every 28-day treatment
cycle and reviewed by the treating physician and a
neuroradiologist. Required scans included computed
tomography of the chest and abdomen, as well as magnetic
resonance imaging of both the brain and full spine to assess
the extent of leptomeningeal disease. While measurable
disease was assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.0, leptomeningeal
metastases is not considered a measurable lesion.
Moreover, a prior autopsy study has shown that subtle
changes in MRI findings might not accurately represent
changes in actual degree of leptomeningeal tumor burden
[30]. As such, the current trial stipulated complete
resolution of a previously noted area of leptomeningeal
metastasis on MRI to meet the prospective requirement
for radiologic improvement. As well, we also separately
assessed clinical response.

This was an open-label, dose-escalation study to
evaluate the safety and feasibility of high dose gefitinib
in the treatment of leptomeningeal metastases NSCLC
in patients with known or suspected EGFR mutations.
The study followed a standard 3+3 design, with three
preplanned dose levels (750 mg, 1000 mg, and 1250 mg).
The decision for dose escalation was made after three to
six patients in a cohort were evaluated for adverse events
after completing one 28-day cycle of daily gefitinib.
A  dose-limiting toxicity was defined as any ­gefitinibrelated grade 3, 4, or 5 toxicity as defined by the National
Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC)
version 3.0, with the following exceptions: grade 3
diarrhea, grade 3 or 4 rash, or grade 3 or 4 elevations
in hepatic transaminases would not be considered doselimiting toxicities if they improved to ≤ grade 2 after
holding therapy for up to 14 days.

Treatment plan and assessments
Previous phase I trials of gefitinib monotherapy had
established a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 600–700
mg with continuous daily dosing. [21–24]. In order to
deliver sufficiently high doses of gefitinib without risking
severe somnolence or other dose-limiting toxicity, patients
were treated for 14 days at one of three planned daily dose
levels of high-dose gefitinib (750 mg, 1000 mg, or 1250
mg) followed by 14 days of therapy at a “maintenance”
dose of 500 mg daily, a dose previously identified as safe
and employed in phase II trials [27, 28]. This 28-day
period was considered one cycle of treatment. Subjects
kept a pill diary, which was reviewed by study staff and
compared to the remaining pill count every 14 days.
Subjects underwent a history, physical examination,
and standard laboratory studies (complete blood count,
chemistries, liver and renal function tests, and coagulation
studies) prior to starting therapy and at the completion
of both the high-dose and maintenance periods of each
treatment cycle. In addition, patients underwent a
detailed neurological examination by a neuro-oncologist
to document any neurological deficits on days 1 and 14
(i.e., at the completion of 2 weeks of high-dose therapy)
of each treatment cycle. As in other previously published
clinical trials for leptomeningeal metastasis, this trial
defined neurological improvement/remission as distinct
neurological improvement of at least one symptom or sign,
without deterioration of other neurological symptoms/
signs. Neurological stable disease was defined as having
no distinct change of existing neurological symptoms/
signs, while progression was defined as deterioration
of symptoms/signs or appearance of new neurological
symptoms/signs [29]. Specific attention was paid to any
new or worsening neurological deficit that was marked
enough to interfere with activities of daily living (ADLs),
though less severe but persistent neurological deficits were

Steady-state gefitinib concentrations
Plasma and CSF were collected on day 14 of
each treatment cycle, following the completion of the
high-dose portion of gefitinib therapy. Samples were
drawn between 4–6 hours after the administration of
gefitinib. Samples were labeled and stored at – 20°C.
CSF and plasma gefitinib steady state concentrations
were determined at Eurofins Medinet B.V. (Breda, the
Netherlands) using previously described methods of
liquid-liquid extraction and high- performance liquid
chromatography with mass spectrometric detection,
though at neutral pH [22].

Statistical analysis
Survival and neurological progression-free survival
were measured from the start of therapy. Neurological
progression-free survival was defined as the period
from study registration until the development of either
death, clinical neurological progression as determined
by neurological assessment and examination by a neurooncologist, or radiological progression as noted on brain
or spine MRI.
