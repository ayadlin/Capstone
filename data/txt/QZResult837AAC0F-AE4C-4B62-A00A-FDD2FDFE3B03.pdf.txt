Abstract:

p53-based cyclotherapy is proving to be a promising approach to palliate undesired
effects of chemotherapy in patients with tumours carrying p53 mutations. For
example, pre-treatment of cell cultures with Nutlin-3, a highly-selective inhibitor of
the p53-mdm2 interaction, has been successfully used as a cytostatic agent to protect
normal cells, but not p53-defective cells, from subsequent treatment with mitotic
poisons or S-phase specific drugs. Here we sought to evaluate whether low doses of
Actinomycin D (LDActD), a clinically-approved drug and potent p53 activator, could
substitute Nutlin-3 in p53-based cyclotherapy. We found that pre-treatment with
LDActD before adding the aurora kinase inhibitor VX-680 protects normal fibroblasts
from polyploidy and nuclear morphology abnormalities induced by VX-680. However,
and although to a lower extent than normal fibroblasts, tumour cell lines bearing p53
mutations were also protected by LDActD (but not Nutlin-3) from VX-680-induced
polyploidy. We also report that a difference between the response of p53 wild-type
cells and p53-defective cells to the LDActD/VX-680 sequential combination is that only
the former fail to enter S-phase and therefore accumulate in G1/G0. We propose that
drugs that incorporate into DNA during S-phase may perform better as second drugs
than mitotic poisons in cyclotherapy approaches using LDActD as a cytostatic agent.

INTRODUCTION

alterations in factors regulating p53 [4]. For instance, high
expression of mdm2 [5], which is p53’s primary negative
regulator (mdm2 binding to p53 inhibits p53’s function
and enhances p53 degradation by the proteasome), is a
frequent event in tumours expressing intact p53. Other
events leading to impaired p53 function in tumours
include loss of expression of the mdm2 inhibitor p14ARF
[6] or the expression of viral oncogenes [7].
Most classic chemotherapeutic agents preferentially
target rapidly dividing cells. However, selectivity towards
cancer cells is limited and therefore toxicity to normal
tissues remains a major problem in the clinic. In addition,
most of these agents are highly mutagenic either by
causing damage to DNA (directly or indirectly) or, as in
the case of mitotic poisons, by disrupting chromosome
distribution. These effects contribute to the killing of

p53, also known as the “guardian of the genome”
[1], is perhaps the most studied tumour suppressor to
date. p53 activation occurs in response to a variety of
stresses, including DNA damage, and can lead to different
outcomes in cells [2]. One is a protective cytostatic effect
that prevents damaged cells from multiplying until lesions
have been sufficiently repaired. Alternatively, and perhaps
in response to a combination of signals to p53 indicating
that the damage is irreparable, p53 activity triggers
programmed cell death. Highlighting its important role
in cancer, the P53 gene is mutated or deleted in about
50% of human adult solid tumours [3]. In many of the
remaining tumours the p53 pathway is inactivated due to

tumour cells, but also have undesired consequences on
normal tissues that lead to neutropaenia, hair loss, and
malaise during treatment and also to an increase in the
risk of second tumours later in life. Cyclotherapy is an
emerging strategy that aims at reducing the toxicity,
mutagenicity, and aneuploidy in normal tissues associated
with classic chemotherapy [8,9]. In this regard, the current
knowledge on small-molecule agents that preferentially
induce p53 mediated cell-cycle arrest rather than apoptosis
could be of great utility. It is generally accepted that a mild
activation of p53 should prevent the entry of normal cells
into S-phase and mitosis [8, 9]. Hence, using low doses
of p53 activators to induce the protective cytostatic effect
of p53, could protect normal cells with intact p53 from
the toxicity of S- and M-phase poisons, including many
of the classic cancer therapeutics. Instead, and if the p53
activating agent is sufficiently selective, tumour cells
with defects in the P53 gene would continue progressing
through the cell cycle and thus remain sensitive to standard
therapy. Hence, in principle, this approach should be
particularly beneficial for patients with tumours that carry
deletions or inactivating mutations in p53 [8].
Indeed, the use of a small molecule, Nutlin-3, a highly
selective inhibitor of the p53-mdm2 interaction [10],
has led to promising results. In cultured cells, this nongenotoxic p53 activator can protect wild-type p53 cells,
including non-tumour cells, from the cell killing effects
of DNA synthesis and mitotic poisons [11-13]. It is most
encouraging that protecting normal tissues with Nutlin-3
from the effects of a mitotic poison has also proven to be
a successful strategy in a preclinical model [14]. However
there are two major drawbacks with Nutlin-3; first, its
use in the clinic still needs to be approved and, second,
it needs to be administered at high doses in vivo [10,14]
In the cyclotherapy study presented here, we
investigate whether low doses of Actinomycin D
(LDActD), a clinically-approved antineoplastic agent

RESULTS
Differences in the p53 response after treatment
with Nutlin-3 and Actinomycin D
In spite of their different mechanisms of action, the
ability of both LDActD and Nutlin-3 [11] to decrease cell
growth is highly dependent on wild-type p53. This was
clearly shown in a recent publication [17] and corroborated
here for LDActD with a colony-growth assay comparing
HCT116 colon carcinoma cells expressing wild-type p53

[15], could mimic the protective effects of Nutlin-3
on normal cells in culture. This concept was based
on evidence that low nanomolar doses of ActD are not
significantly genotoxic [16], effectively increase p53
levels and transcription function and induce the expression
of a panel of genes that overlaps with Nutlin-3-induced
genes [17]. In addition, this highly-potent compound can
cause p53-dependent reversible cell-cycle arrest in normal
keratinocytes [17].
Despite the similarities between LDActD and
Nutlin-3 in cells with regards to their effects on the p53
pathway, their mechanisms of action differ. Whereas
Nutlin-3 binds directly to mdm2, ActD inhibits RNA
synthesis by binding to GC-rich regions in DNA and
is especially effective at disrupting ribosomal RNA
biosynthesis [18-21]. This causes a nucleolar stress that is
sensed by p53 [22, 23]. According to the current model,
nucleolar stress caused by ActD is able to enhance the
interaction between mdm2 and ribosomal proteins, such
as L11, resulting in the impairment of mdm2-dependent
degradation of p53 [24]. These mechanistic considerations
led us to test whether LDActD could indeed substitute
Nutlin-3 in a p53-based cyclotherapy approach.

Figure 1. LDActD’s effects on cell survival are p53-dependent. HCT116 cells with wild-type p53 or knockout for p53 were treated with
ActD for 72 hours, after which they were fixed and stained with Giemsa.

with HCT116 cells lacking p53 (Figure 1).
According to the existing literature, there are no
clear differences between the effects of Nutlin-3 and
LDActD on the p53 pathway. Phosphorylation of p53
on serine 15 is not substantially increased in response to
exposure to either, whereas phosphorylation of p53 on
serine 46 is increased to a similar extent by both agents
[17]. Phosphorylation of p53 at serine 392 was initially
observed after LDActD treatment, but not following
Nutlin-3 treatment [17]. A more detailed analysis showed

that phosphorylation at this site is also detectable in
response to Nutlin-3 [25]. However, because of the nature
of their p53-activation mechanisms, some differences
in the speed at which p53 is induced by Nutlin-3 and
ActD could be expected. As shown in Figure 2, Nutlin-3
treatment quickly increases p53 levels, its performance
being much faster than ActD’s in the same experiment.
According to current understanding, ActD’s effect on
mdm2 requires that nucleoli are disrupted and that there
are sufficient molecules of ribosomal proteins to inhibit

mdm2. This is perhaps a much longer process than directly
inhibiting mdm2 in order to stabilise p53. Whether this
difference in the speed at which the p53 protein is increased
is also partly due to differences in the permeability and/
or stability of the compounds cannot yet be ruled out.
Alternatively, Nutlin-3 and ActD may increase p53 in
certain cell subpopulations only, i.e. in cells at particular
stages of the cell cycle. These considerations may have
repercussion for the use of ActD in a cyclotherapy setting.

It has been recently shown that pretreatment with
Nutin-3 protects normal keratinocytes from polyploidy
caused by the small molecule aurora kinase inhibitor VX680 (or MK-0457) [11]. Building upon the experience with
the Nutlin-3/VX-680 combination, we carried out similar
experiments using normal human dermal fibroblasts
(NHDFs) pretreated with LDActD, instead of Nutlin-3,
and subsequently exposed to VX-680. VX-680 is a potent
aurora kinase inhibitor tested for the treatment of solid
tumours and leukemia. Clinical trials were stopped due
to electrocardiograph QTc interval prolongation in one
patient. Nevertheless, because cyclotherapy studies
using Nutlin-3 have been performed in combination
with VX-680, we proceeded with the LDActD/VX-680

combination as this facilitates comparisons between
Nutlin-3 and LDActD as potential cytostatic agents in
p53-based cyclotherapy.
Activity of aurora kinases peaks during the G2 and M
phases of the cell cycle and, accordingly, VX-680’s killing
effect is mainly by induction of endoreduplication in the
absence of mitosis resulting in polyploidy and, eventually,
cell death by mitotic catastrophe [26]. Normal dividing
cells are susceptible to this effect and indeed proliferating
NHDFs respond to VX-680 growth inhibition (Figure 1
supplemental data). Within 48 hours of treatment there
was a significant increase in the number of polyploid 8N
cells in cultures treated with 100-500 nM VX-680 (Figure
3A and Figure 2 supplemental data). At the higher doses
of VX-680, the proportion of 8N cells diminished in
association with an increase in the number of sub-diploid
population. In order to ensure on-target effects of the
compound we chose to work at a concentration of VX-

680 of 100 nM.
At 1.2 and 1.6 nM, ActD had a weak cell-cycle
inhibitory effect on NHDF cells that became more evident
with a slightly higher (2 nM) concentration (Figure 3A).
The number of dead cells with a sub-diploid DNA content
was only marginally increased by these doses of ActD.
Interestingly, NHDF cells are able to resume proliferation
upon removal of ActD (Figure 3B).
Preincubation of the NHDF cells with 1.2, 1.6 and 2
nM ActD before VX-680 treatment markedly diminished
the proportion of polyploid 8N cells (and to some extent
the number of sub-diploid cells) in a dose-dependent
manner, demonstrating that LDActD’s cytostatic effect
can protect normal cells from the effects of aurora kinase
inhibition. A marked difference in the number of cells in
G1 was also observed between VX-680 treated (8.3% of
cells in G1) and ActD/VX-680 treated cells (up to 38.2%
of cells in G1) (Figure 3A). This suggests that at least part

clearly increased the levels of p53. As expected from
the results in Figure 2, long-term exposure to low doses
of ActD is required to increase p53 levels. The levels
of the p53 downstream transcriptional target p21, a
well-established cell-cycle arresting protein were also
increased by LDActD. This suggests that the protective
effect of LDActD in NHDF cells could be due to the
activation of p53 by this compound. We also observed that
cells with abnormal nuclei are more frequent in NHDF
cells expressing a dominant negative form of p53 than in
the corresponding control NHDFs (Figure 5B).

of the protection of NHDFs by LDActD from VX-680 is
due to inhibition of the G1/S transition by LDActD. The
importance of this point is highlighted in the Discussion
section.
We also quantified the number of NHDF cells
with aberrant nuclear morphologies induced by VX-680
(Figure 4). In the cultures treated with VX-680 only,
a large proportion of the cells have abnormal nuclei.
However, this number was markedly lower in the cultures
that had been preincubated with LDActD (Figures 4A and
4B). Moreover, NHDF cells recovered from the ActD/
VX-680 combination and proliferated after removal of the
compounds (Figure 4C). In these recovery experiments, the
number of cells with aberrant nuclei in the cultures treated
with VX-680 alone as well as with the LDActD/VX-680
combination did rise after the recovery period. However,
the number of abnormal cells remained comparatively low
in the cultures recovering from exposure to the LDActD/
VX-680-combination regimen (Figure 4D).
Finally, Figure 5A shows that in NHDFs, LDActD

frequent in cancers. These cell lines, MDAMB231 and
MDAMB468 express transcriptionally inactive p53 with
mutations R280K and R273H, respectively. In both cell
lines, as in normal fibroblasts, VX-680 treatment alone led
to an increase in 8N-polyploid cells (Figure 6). However,
and unexpectedly, LDActD pre-treatment at the doses
required to protect normal fibroblasts also reduced the
population of VX-680-induced 8N cells in these two
tumour cell types. The effect of LDActD in these tumour
cells differs from the effect in normal fibroblasts in that
most MDAMB231 and MDAMB468 cells accumulate in a
tetraploid state, whereas co-treatment of NHDF cells also
leads to a rise in the proportion of cells with a 2N DNA
content. In fact, it can be seen that exposure to LDActD on

its own led to a small accumulation of cells with 4N DNA
content in both MDAMB231 and MDAMB468 cultures.
It may be that this small effect of LDActD becomes more
apparent in cultures treated with a compound that, like
VX-680, impairs the G2/M transition. A similar response
to LDActD combined with VX-680 was observed in
HCT116 p53-null cells (Figure 7), strongly supporting
that the effect seen in mutant-p53 tumour cell lines is not
dependent on the presence of mutant p53. Unlike ActD,
Nutlin-3 had no effect on the cell-cycle progression of p53
mutant tumour cells either on its own or in combination
with VX-680 (Figure 8). This is in line with the high
selectivity of Nutlin-3 as an inhibitor of the p53/mdm2
interaction.
However, despite the ability of LDActD to weaken

VX-680-induced polyploidy in cells with defective p53,
when cells are allowed to recover from treatment upon
drug removal, the cell density in the LDActD/VX-680treated and VX-680-treated cultures is similar after the
recovery period (Figure 9).
In conclusion, we observed that, even at low
doses, ActD has p53-independent effects, including a
p53-independent G2/M arresting effect that becomes
accentuated in the presence of an aurora kinase inhibitor.
Therefore, we cannot exclude that LDActD could protect
a proportion of tumour cells with defective p53 from the
toxicity of this mitotic poison.

growth rate of p53-mutant tumours but, at the same time,
prevent cell killing by mitotic poisons. Indeed, and in
agreement with this, low doses of the intercalating agent
Adriamycin have been reported to protect p53-null tumour
cells from taxol derived mitotic poisons [27].
Nevertheless, as argued below, we believe that
pretreatment with LDActD might have a future in p53based cyclotherapy. A key difference between the effects
of LDActD in p53 wild-type cells and p53-defective cells
is that only the former undergo arrest in the G1/G0 phase
of the cell cycle and therefore they do not enter S-phase.
Hence, we envisage that clinically-approved drugs that
incorporate into DNA during S-phase, such as gemcitabine
and cytosine arabinoside, may constitute a better choice
following pretreatment with LDActD than mitotic
poisons. In support of this future direction, efficacy has
been demonstrated in vitro using Nutlin-3 pretreatment
and S-phase-specific chemotherapeutics as a second
treatment [13]. In conclusion, LDActD merits further
evaluation in the context of p53-based cyclotherapy.

DISCUSSION
Motivated by the promising results obtained by
combining Nutlin-3 with mitotic poisons and the similar
p53-dependent effects of LDActD and Nutlin-3, we have
sought to investigate the potential of LDActD as the
cytostatic agent in a p53-based cyclotherapy approach. In
summary, we found that:
1. Low non-genotoxic doses of ActD have a
reversible cytostatic effect on normal human dermal
fibroblasts and protect them from aneuploidy induced by
VX-680.
2. However, treatment with LDActD before VX680 also prevents the appearance of 8N cells in tumour
cells expressing mutant p53 or lacking p53, even though
LDActD pre-treatment does not weaken the growth
inhibitory effect of VX-680.
3. Unlike p53-mutant cells and HCT116 p53
knockout cells, NHDFs as well as HCT116 p53 wild-type
cells (Figure 10), accumulate in G1/G0 in response to
LDActD on its own or in combination with the subsequent
VX-680 treatment. This suggests that wild-type p53 is
responsible for reducing S-phase entry upon LDActD
treatment.
The evidence presented here supports that
pretreatment with a low non-genotoxic dose of ActD, a
clinically-approved drug, could be an adequate approach
for cyclotherapy studies in animal models, but at the same
time raises two issues for consideration.
First, the therapeutic window for ActD is narrow:
concentrations of ActD above 1 nM are required in order to
protect normal fibroblasts effectively, but concentrations
above 10 nM ActD are genotoxic [17]. Additionally,
concentrations of ActD above 10 nM also affect NHDF
viability (Figure 3 supplemental data). However, Nutlin-3
also shows problems in this regard. This compound is not
very potent in cells (only active in the micromolar range)
and needs to be administered to animals at very high doses
[10, 14].
Second, we have evidence suggesting that ActD
could weaken, at least to some extent, the effect of aurora
kinase inhibitors in tumour cells with mutant p53. Our
expectation is that ActD could contribute to decrease the

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and reagents
NHDF cells were bought from Promocell. NHDF
cells expressing a dominant negative form of p53 were
obtained by stable transfection with an expression vector
for the murine DD-p53 dominant-negative mutant
and neomycin resistance as described [28]. HCT116
and HCT116 p53-null cells were a kind gift from Bert
Vogelstein (Baltimore). H1299 and MCF-7 cells were
bought from ATCC. MDAMB231 and MDAMB468 cells
were bought from CRUK. Actinomycin D was purchased
from Sigma and stock solution was 2 mg/ml in Ethanol.
VX-680 was a gift from Phil Cohen (Dundee) and stock
solution was 10 mM in DMSO.
(±)-Nutlin-3, referred to as Nutlin-3 here, was
purchased from Cayman Chemicals. It must be noted that
this product comprises two enantiomers, active (-)-Nutlin
and inactive (+)-Nutlin. Therefore, 5 μM Nutlin-3
corresponds to 2.5 μM of the active enantiomer. The stock
solution was 50 mM in DMSO.

Cell cycle analysis
Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) was
used to analyse the cell-cycle distribution. Cells were
seeded in 6-well tissue culture coated plates at required
density on Day 1 and compounds were added 24 hours
post-seeding at required doses on Days 2 (cytotastic
agent) and 3 (VX-680). After required treatment times,
Bromodexoyuridine (BrdU), supplied by Sigma, was
added to cells for 30 minutes at final concentration

with the appropriate primary antibody (diluted in blocking
solution) for 1 hour at RT or overnight at 4°C. Membranes
were washed 4 times for 5 minutes at RT in PBS/0.1 %
Tween-20, before incubating with the appropriate HRPconjugated secondary antibody (Dako) diluted in the
blocking solution for 45 minutes at RT. Membranes were
washed a further 5 times for 10 minutes each in PBS/0.1
% v/v Tween-20, and then a further 2 washes for 5 minutes
in PBS at RT before detection of chemiluminescent
signals with ECL solutions according to manufacturer’s

of 30 µM. Cells were subsequently harvested using
trypsinisation, spun down and resuspended in 1 ml of
PBS. Cells were then fixed in 3 ml of ice-cold ethanol and
stored for at least 1 hour at 4ºC. Cells were pelleted and
resuspended in 2 ml of warm pepsin at 1 mg/ml (Sigma)
in 30 mM HCl pH1.5, for 30 minutes at 37ºC with gentle
shaking. Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation and
resuspended in 1 ml of 2M HCl for 20 minutes at RT.
Cells were washed in excess PBS before washing with the
antibody buffer (0.5% w/v BSA, 0.5% v/v Tween-20 in
PBS) and then resuspended in 200 μl of mouse primary
antibody to BrdU (Becton Dickinson) in antibody buffer
for 1 hour at RT. After washing with PBS, the samples were
resuspended in 200 µl of secondary anti-mouse IgG FITC
conjugated antibody (Sigma) and incubated at RT for 30
minutes in the dark. The cells were then washed with PBS
and collected by centrifugation and finally resuspended
in 500 μl of PBS containing 25 μg/ml propidium iodide
(Invitrogen) to stain DNA. Samples were analysed using a
Becton Dickinson FACScan operated by the CELLQuest
software.
