BACKGROUND. Glioblastoma, which is the most malignant brain tumor, remains
incurable and almost always causes death. As a new treatment strategy, the combination of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and paclitaxel was explored for controlling the growth of glioblastoma U87MG xenografts.
METHODS. Human glioblastoma U87MG xenografts were developed in athymic
nude mice for treatments with ATRA, paclitaxel, and ATRA plus paclitaxel. The
efficacy of treatments in controlling tumor growth was assessed by histologic
examination, Western blot analysis, and immunofluorescent labelings.

RESULTS. Astrocytic differentiation in U87MG xenografts was associated with
increased GFAP expression and decreased telomerase expression. The combination of ATRA and paclitaxel was found to cause more apoptosis than paclitaxel
alone. Apoptosis occurred with down-regulation of MEK-2 and overexpression of
p-ERK, p-JNK, and p-p38 MAPK. Down-regulation of both Akt and p-Akt also
favored the apoptotic process. Combination therapy activated the receptormediated pathway of apoptosis with induction of TNF-a, activation of caspase-8,
and cleavage of Bid to tBid. Combination therapy also induced the mitochondria-mediated pathway of apoptosis with an increase in the Bax:Bcl-2 ratio and
mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo into the cytosol. In
addition, combination therapy promoted phosphorylation of Bcl-2 for its inactivation and down-regulated NF-jB and BIRC proteins, indicating suppression of
several cell survival factors. Western blot analysis demonstrated that activation of
cysteine proteases such as calpain, caspase-12, caspase-9, and caspase-3 contributed to apoptosis. Immunofluorescent labelings confirmed overexpression of cysteine proteases in apoptosis.

CONCLUSIONS. Treatment of U87MG xenografts with a combination of ATRA and
paclitaxel induced differentiation and also multiple molecular mechanisms for
apoptosis. Cancer 2008;112:596–607.  2007 American Cancer Society.

lioblastoma is the most lethal and prevalent brain tumor in
humans.1 It is highly resistant to current therapies, causing significant morbidity and mortality in patients, who rarely survive for
1 year after diagnosis.2 Thus, the search continues for an effective
therapy for controlling this devastating disease. Glioblastoma is
comprised of poorly differentiated heterogeneous neoplastic astrocytes having aggressive proliferation and highly invasive properties.1
Because glioblastoma cells avoid differentiation and apoptosis, new
therapeutic strategies should be explored for the induction of both
differentiation and apoptosis in glioblastoma cells in culture and
animal models.

Combination Therapy for Glioblastoma/Karmakar et al.

Retinoids, natural and synthetic derivatives of
vitamin A, have versatile biologic properties. All-trans
retinoic acid (ATRA) inhibits proliferation and
induces differentiation in leukemia and glioblastoma
cells.3,4 Because ATRA inhibits growth and induces
differentiation, it holds therapeutic promise in treating cancer, especially in combination with another
therapeutic agent.5 In vitro, ATRA has been found to
enhance cytotoxicity of cisplatin against squamous,
head and neck, and ovarian cancer cells.6 Other retinoids have also demonstrated growth inhibitory, differentiating, and proapoptotic effects in tumors in
various organs including the mouth, skin, bladder,
lung, prostate, and breast in animal models.7 The
therapeutic action of ATRA can be associated with
phosphorylation and inactivation of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein.8
Paclitaxel is a highly effective anticancer drug
because it stabilizes microtubule dynamics in cancer
cells followed by cell-cycle arrest at the G2/M-phase
transition.9 To our knowledge, the mechanisms by
which paclitaxel trigger apoptosis in various cancers
are not yet completely established but may include
modulation of signal transduction pathways, and the
activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and caspasedependent as well as caspase-independent pathways.10
In addition, paclitaxel induces apoptosis via tumor
necrosis factor (TNF) pathways10 and inactivation of
Bcl-2 by its phosphorylation,11 as well as down-regulation of the Akt survival pathway.12 A recent study13
reports the efficacy of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
alpha (PI3K) inhibitor (PI-103) in controlling glioblastoma due to dual inhibition of PI3Ka (which is
upstream of Akt) and mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR, which is downstream of Akt). Thus, disruption
of the Akt survival pathway is an important therapeutic strategy for controlling glioblastoma.
The combination of ATRA and docetaxel or
taxotere can enhance the induction of cell death in
prostate6 and breast14 cancer cells. In the present
investigation, we used a glioblastoma U87MG xenograft model to explore the efficacy of ATRA and
paclitaxel alone and in combination. We found that
the combination of ATRA and paclitaxel most effectively down-regulated survival factors and activated
mitochondria-dependent multiple pathways for apoptosis in U87MG xenografts in athymic nude mice.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Line and Culture Conditions
The human glioblastoma U87MG cell line was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection

597

(ATCC, Manassas, Va). Cells were grown in 75-cm2
flasks containing 10 mL of 13 RPMI-1640 (Mediatech, Herndon, Va) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin
(Mediatech) in a fully humidified incubator containing 5% carbon dioxide at 378C.

Development of U87MG Xenografts in Nude Mice
for Treatments
Athymic nu/nu mice (aged 6 weeks) were obtained
from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, Mass).
Animal experiments were conducted following the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of
the Department of Health and Human Services (Bethesda, MD) and also approved by our Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Mice were
housed in groups in sterile filter-topped cages and
maintained in a pathogen-free animal facility. Exponentially growing U87MG cells (5 3 106) in 100 lL of
13 RPMI-1640 were xenotransplanted by subcutaneous injection in the right or left flank of each
mouse under isoflurane anesthesia. Stock solutions
of ATRA (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo)
and paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ) were prepared using dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO) as the vehicle and appropriately diluted in
saline before treatments. Palpable U87MG xenografts
were developed within 6 to 8 days. Animals with
3-week-old xenografts were randomly assigned to 4
groups (6 animals per group) for treatment: control
(CTL), ATRA, paclitaxel, and ATRA plus paclitaxel.
Because the final concentration of DMSO (<0.01%)
did not affect the growth of U87MG cells or xenografts (data not shown), we did not treat animals in
the CTL group with the vehicle. Each animal in other
groups received, intraperitoneally, a daily dose of
ATRA (1.5 lg/kg), paclitaxel (45 lg/kg), or ATRA
(1.5 lg/kg) plus paclitaxel administered 4 hours later
(45 lg/kg) for 7 days. An early termination of the
study was used to prevent overburden and rupture of
the tumor, leading to the death of untreated animals
and also to explore the biochemical mechanisms of
the treatments leading to tumor regression in treated
animals. We measured tumor volume, not body
weight, in all groups to assess the efficacy of the
treatments.
Histologic Examination of U87MG Xenografts
After all treatments animals were sacrificed following
the IACUC guidelines. Xenografts were surgically
excised. Approximately one-half of each tumor was
immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at
2808C. The other half was immediately frozen
(2708C) in Optima Cutting Temperature (OCT)

media (Fisher Scientific, Suwanee, Ga) and 5-lm sections were cut using a cryostat. These sections were
stained with hematoxylin and eosin for routine examination of histopathology and assessment of cell
death.

Western Blot Analysis
We previously reported this method15 and modified
it for the current investigation. Briefly, each tumor
was gently minced and homogenized with a handheld
minipestle in 100 lL of ice-cold lysis buffer (250 mM
sucrose, 1 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid
[EDTA], 0.05% digitonin, 25 mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.8],
1 mM 1,4-dithio-DL-threitol [DTT], 1 lg/mL leupeptin, 1 lg/mL pepstatin, 1 lg/mL aprotinin, 1 mM
benzamidine, and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [PMSF]) in a microcentrifuge tube on ice for
1 minute, centrifuged at 12,000g at 48C for 3 minutes
to obtain the pellet (fraction containing mitochondria) and the supernatant fluid (cytosolic extract
without mitochondria). Pellets and supernatant fluids
were analyzed for specific proteins. Samples were
used for the determination of protein concentration
spectrophotometrically, denaturation in boiling water
for 5 minutes, and then loading (20 lg protein/well)
onto the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gradient (4%–20% or 5%) gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif).
Proteins were resolved by electrophoresis in Laemmli
buffer and electroblotted to the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. Blots were incubated with
appropriate dilution of a primary immunoglobulin
(Ig) G antibody followed by incubation with an alkaline horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary IgG antibody. Specific protein bands were
detected by a HRP/hydrogen peroxide-catalyzed oxidation of luminol using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ)
and autoradiography. Autoradiograms were scanned
and analyzed using QuantityOne software (Bio-Rad).
In Situ Immunofluorescent Labelings to Assess
Expression of Cysteine Proteases
Tumor sections were fixed to slides using 95% (volume/volume [v/v]) ethanol for 10 minutes and rinsed
twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) for
10 minutes each. Sections were blocked with 2% (v/v)
horse and goat sera (Sigma Chemical Company)
for 30 minutes, and probed with a (1:100) primary
IgG antibody against calpain, caspase-12, or caspase3 for 1 hour. Slides were rinsed twice in PBS for
5 minutes each followed by incubation with (1:75)
secondary Texas Red-conjugated or fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat antirabbit secondary IgG antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,

Calif) for 30 minutes. Slides were then rinsed twice in
PBS and once in water, mounted with VectaShield
(Vector Laboratories), and viewed promptly under a
nonconfocal fluorescence microscope at 2003 magnification (Olympus, Japan) to capture digital pictures
using ImagePro-Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, Md), as described previously.16

Detection of Apoptosis With Overexpression
of a Cysteine Protease
Detection of apoptosis was performed with modification of our previously reported method.16 Briefly,
5 lm tumor sections were fixed in 95% (v/v) ethanol,
rinsed in PBS, fixed again in 4% formaldehyde, and
rinsed twice in PBS. Sections were placed in 0.2%
Triton X-100 for 5 minutes on ice, rinsed twice in
PBS, incubated in equilibration buffer (Promega,
Madison, Wis) for 5 minutes, and subjected to
the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated
dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) reaction for 1 hour
at 378C. After the TUNEL reaction, slides were
blocked with 2% normal goat and horse sera for 30
minutes. Each section was probed with a (1:100) primary IgG antibody for 1 hour followed by incubation
with (1:50) Texas Red-conjugated anti-Digoxigenin
(DIG) primary IgG antibody (Roche, Indianapolis, Ind)
and (1:75) FITC-conjugated goat antirabbit secondary
IgG antibody (Vector Laboratories) for 30 minutes.
Slides were washed, mounted with VectaShield (Vector
Laboratories), and immediately examined under a
nonconfocal fluorescence microscope (Olympus) at
2003 magnification to capture digital images using
ImagePro-Plus Software (Media Cybernetics).
Statistical Analysis
Western blot analysis and immunofluorescent images
were used to quantify the total number of pixels
above the background by using the public domain
NIH Image 1.63 software (available at URL: http://
rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/ last accessed April 10,
2007). Data were analyzed using StatView software
(Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, Calif), expressed as arbitrary Units  standard error of mean (SEM) of separate experiments (n3), and compared by one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Fisher
post hoc test. A significant difference between CTL
and treatment was indicated by *P < .05 or **P < .001.

ments was evident in mice and also after surgical
removal (Fig. 1A). Compared with control tumors,
regression of tumors occurred as follows: 40% by
ATRA, 48% by paclitaxel, and 72% by ATRA plus paclitaxel (Fig. 1B). Combination therapy with ATRA plus
paclitaxel demonstrated a significant reduction in tumor volume when compared with single therapy with
ATRA (P <.006) or paclitaxel (P <.02). Histopathologic
examination revealed that control tumors maintained
the characteristic growth of glioblastoma, ATRA alone
inhibited tumor cell proliferation and caused astrocytic differentiation, paclitaxel alone induced cell death
to some extent, and ATRA plus paclitaxel caused a significant amount of cell death (Fig. 1C). Compared with
control U87MG xenografts, single therapy with ATRA
induced 13% and paclitaxel caused 34% cell death,
whereas ATRA plus paclitaxel produced 55% cell death
(Fig. 1D). Significantly more cell death occurred after
combination therapy with ATRA plus paclitaxel than
single therapy with ATRA (P < .0001) or paclitaxel
(P < .0002), indicating synergistic effect of combination therapy on cell death.

Biochemical Markers of Differentiation
Western blot analysis showed the changes in expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and the
catalytic subunit of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) in U87MG xenografts after treatments (Fig. 2). b-Actin expression was used as loading
control (Fig. 2A). It is well known that ATRA induces
cellular differentiation. Combination therapy significantly increased GFAP expression when compared
with control (P <.0001), single therapy with ATRA (P <
.004), or paclitaxel (P <.001), confirming astrocytic differentiation in U87MG xenografts (Fig. 2A). In addi-

tion, combination therapy with ATRA plus paclitaxel
significantly decreased hTERT expression when compared with control (P < .0001) or single therapy with
paclitaxel (P < .01) (Fig. 2B), indicating suppression of
cell proliferation leading to cell differentiation.

Changes in Cell Signaling Pathways
The MAPK and Akt pathways coordinate and regulate
signaling mechanisms for cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and death. Western blot analysis
demonstrated alterations in levels of key players of
the MAPK and Akt pathways in U87MG xenografts
after treatments (Fig. 3). Down-regulation of the survival signaling molecule MAPK kinase-2 (MEK-2) and
activation of the death signaling molecules such as
phosphorylated forms of extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (p-ERK), JNK (p-JNK), and p38 MAPK (p-p38
MAPK) indicated the therapeutic efficacy of treatments, especially ATRA plus paclitaxel, in U87MG
xenografts. Akt overexpression is a major problem in
glioblastoma. Single therapy with ATRA down-regulated total Akt and its activation (phospho-Akt [ie,
p-Akt]), whereas paclitaxel decreased total Akt but
increased p-Akt. It is interesting to note that combination therapy with ATRA plus paclitaxel nearly abolished expression of both Akt and p-Akt in U87MG
xenografts. In the presence of ATRA, therefore, paclitaxel could dramatically down-regulate Akt pathway
for suppression of a major survival signaling so as to
facilitate apoptosis.

U87MG xenografts with ATRA plus paclitaxel (Fig. 5).
We used a monoclonal Bax antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif), which could detect
the 21-kilodalton (kD) Baxa and 24-kD Baxb subunits. We considered both subunits as the total Bax
expression in our study. It is interesting to note that
we found that treatments with paclitaxel and ATRA
plus paclitaxel produced a very close band above the
26-kD Bcl-2 that could be the phospho-Bcl-2 (p-Bcl2). We decided to confirm this prediction later using
p-Bcl-2-specific antibody. Treatment with paclitaxel
is known to cause Bcl-2 phosphorylation for its inactivation.11 After combination therapy, an increase in
the Bax:Bcl-2 ratio could trigger the mitochondrial
release of several proapoptotic molecules, suggesting
activation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis
in U87MG xenografts.

Combination Therapy Activated Mitochondrial
Pathway of Apoptosis
Mitochondrial release of proapoptotic molecules such
as cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo into the cytosol
could indicate activation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. We separated mitochondrial and
cytosolic fractions to perform Western blot analysis
(Fig. 6). We used b-actin as cytosolic loading control

and COX-4 as mitochondrial loading control. We
examined cytochrome c levels in whole tumor lysates
after all treatments. Treatment with paclitaxel or
ATRA plus paclitaxel decreased cytochrome c level in
the mitochondrial fraction and concomitantly
increased its level in the cytosolic fraction. Compared
with the control group, treatments with paclitaxel
alone and ATRA plus paclitaxel highly increased the
cytosolic cytochrome c levels. Mitochondrial release
of cytochrome c is a well-known precondition for formation of apoptosome and activation of caspases for
apoptosis in glioblastoma cells15,18 and other cancer
cells.19,20 Combination therapy also highly increased
cytosolic level of Smac/Diablo (Fig. 6) that could suppress the baculovirus inhibitor-of-apoptosis repeat
containing (BIRC) proteins to facilitate apoptosis.

Inactivation of Bcl-2 and Down-regulation
of NF-jB and BIRC Proteins
We determined the levels of several antiapoptotic proteins by Western blot analysis (Fig. 7). Antiapoptotic
Bcl-2 protein is inactivated by phosphorylation.11
Both ATRA8,14 and paclitaxel11 inactivate Bcl-2 by its
phosphorylation. We used a polyclonal p-Bcl-2-specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) that detected
only the p-Bcl-2 indicating inactivation of Bcl-2 in
U87MG xenografts after treatments with ATRA and
paclitaxel alone or in combination, whereas the control group did not demonstrate p-Bcl-2 expression

caspase-3-activated DNase (ICAD) fragment, and CAD. Combination therapy
activated calpain and caspase cascades for proteolysis leading to apoptosis.

Activation of Cysteine Proteases and Proteolysis
Western blot analysis demonstrated dramatic activation of several cysteine proteases such as calpain,
capase-12, caspase-9, and caspase-3 after combination therapy (Fig. 8). Using a polyclonal caspase-3
antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), we detected
high levels of both the 32-kD procaspase-3 and
20-kD active caspase-3 after treatment of xenografts
with ATRA plus paclitaxel. Increased activities of
calpain and caspase-3 during apoptosis can cleave
a-spectrin to generate the calpain-specific 145-kD
spectrin breakdown product (SBDP) and caspase-3specific 120-kD SBDP.15,18,21 Treatment of xenografts
with ATRA plus paclitaxel markedly increased formation of 145-kD SBDP and 120-kD SBDP (Fig. 8), suggesting increased activities of calpain and caspase-3,
respectively. An increase in caspase-3 activity also

Immunofluorescent Labelings to Examine Overexpression
of Proteases in Apoptosis
We used U87MG xenograft sections for single immunofluorescent (SIF) and double immunofluorescent
(DIF) labelings (Fig. 9). The purpose of SIF labeling
was to detect overexpression of a specific protease,
whereas DIF labeling is used to find colocalization of
apoptotic DNA fragmentation with overexpression of
a specific protease (Fig. 9). Compared with control
xenografts, treatment with an ATRA plus paclitaxel
combination caused calpain overexpression and also
apoptotic DNA fragmentation with calpain overexpression (Fig. 9A). Again, SIF labeling detected
caspase-12 overexpression and DIF labeling demonstrated cell death along with caspase-12 overexpression after combination therapy (Fig. 9B).
Furthermore, combination therapy significantly

stimulated caspase-3 overexpression and caused apoptosis with caspase-3 overexpression (Fig. 9C). These
observations indicated involvement of calpain, caspase-12, and caspase-3 in apoptosis in U87MG xenografts after combination therapy.
Based on all the results, we proposed a schematic diagram to show pathways leading to cell differentiation and apoptosis in U87MG xenografts after
treatments with ATRA and paclitaxel (Fig. 10).

DISCUSSION
The results of the current study showed the efficacy of
ATRA plus paclitaxel combination therapy in glioblastoma U87MG xenografts in nude mice. The combination therapy: 1) caused regression of tumors due to
differentiation and apoptosis, 2) inhibited a number
of antiapoptotic molecules to promote apoptosis, and
3) activated multiple molecular mechanisms involving
MAP kinases and cysteine proteases for apoptosis.

Schematic presentation demonstrating that combination therapy with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) plus paclitaxel (TXL) induced multiple mechanisms for differentiation and apoptosis in U87MG xenografts. The combination of ATRA plus TXL demonstrated efficacy due to synergistic inhibition of cell proliferation and survival factors such as hTERT, Akt, NF-jB, and BIRCs as well as activation and crosstalk between tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), MAP kinases,

Combination Therapy for Glioblastoma/Karmakar et al.

Combination therapy regressed tumors due to
growth arrest, astrocytic differentiation with up-regulation of GFAP and down-regulation of hTERT, and
induction of apoptosis. Telomerase activity has been
reported in 98% of immortalized cell lines and
approximately 90% of tumor tissues and it is
involved in the regulation of apoptosis.22 Both telomerase activity and apoptosis are modulated by
Bcl-2.23 ATRA is well known to inhibit cellular proliferation and induce differentiation in cancer cells, as
we have also reported recently in glioblastoma cells.4
ATRA can down-regulate Bcl-2,3 inhibit telomerase
activity,24 and thus make the cells prone to apoptosis.22,25 Paclitaxel is a potent cytostatic drug against
many tumors10 and is known to induce apoptosis
due to phosphorylation and inactivation of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2.11 In our U87MG xenografts, ATRA
plus paclitaxel combination therapy down-regulated
hTERT and inactivated Bcl-2 for promoting apoptosis. Combination of ATRA with another chemotherapeutic agent is common. The combination of ATRA
and As2O3 was reported to have induced cell death
in leukemia.26
We revealed that the combination of ATRA plus
paclitaxel combination therapy down-regulated the
survival signaling molecule MEK-2, whereas it upregulated death signaling molecules such as p-ERK,
p-JNK, and p-p38 MAPK and also inhibited the survival signaling Akt pathway in U87MG xenografts.
MEK-2 is a component of the MAPK pathway and is
associated with cell growth. It has been reported that
the combination of MEK1 of 2 inhibitor potently
enhanced the cytoxicity of the paclitaxel derivative
taxotere in breast cancer MCF-7 cells.27 In our
model, MEK-2 down-regulation could be due to differentiation and inhibition of cell proliferation.
Although activation of ERK is believed to be related
to cell survival, there is growing evidence demonstrating that activation of ERK (p-ERK) is strongly
associated with apoptosis in a variety of cancers,28,29
including glioblastoma.30 Studies showed that ATRA
promoted apoptosis with activation of ERK, JNK, and
p38 MAPK31 and only p38 MAPK in metaplastic Barrett cells.32 These earlier studies strongly suggested
that ATRA contributed to activation of the MAPK
pathway for apoptosis in our U87MG xenografts. The
activation of JNK and p38 MAPK in our U87MG
xenografts after combination therapy is in keeping
with another study in which paclitaxel has been
shown to activate both kinases for apoptosis.33 Activation of Akt is a major event in the development of
glioblastoma and approximately 80% of glioblastoma
cases express high levels of Akt.34 Phosphorylation of
Akt results in activation of Akt kinase activity, which

605

has the potential to deregulate cell cycle, suppress
apoptosis, and stimulate cell survival with up-regulation of NF-jB.35 Our combination therapy of ATRA
plus paclitaxel not only activated MAP kinases to signal apoptosis but also down-regulated Akt expression
and activation in U87MG xenografts to promote apoptosis. A combination of paclitaxel and MEK inhibitor caused dramatic inactivation of Akt for apoptosis
in tumor cells.36 Cepharanthine induced apoptosis in
human hepatocellular carcinoma with activation of
MAP kinases and down-regulation of Akt.28
The results of the current study demonstrated
that treatment of U87MG xenografts with paclitaxel
alone and an ATRA plus paclitaxel combination upregulated TNF-a and activated caspase-8 for Bid
cleavage, indicating activation of the ligand-mediated
caspase cascade for apoptosis. Previous studies
reported that both ATRA5 and paclitaxel37 could
induce TNF-a expression. Notably, TNF-a plays important roles in differentiation38 and apoptosis with
activation of MAPK39 and caspase-817 pathways. An
earlier study reported that paclitaxel caused caspase8 activation and Bid cleavage to generate tBid to trigger apoptosis10 and we demonstrated similar results
herein. Our combination therapy increased Bax:Bcl-2
ratio, supporting a previous observation that the
combination of ATRA and docetaxel caused downregulation of Bcl-2 in prostate cancer LNCap cells.6
An increase in Bax:Bcl-2 ratio is a key determinant
for inducing the release of several proapoptotic
molecules from mitochondria.15,18,21,40
We found that ATRA plus paclitaxel combination
therapy induced the mitochondrial release of proapoptotic molecules cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo.
Cytosolic cytochrome c forms apoptosome for activation of caspases for apoptosis,19,20 whereas Smac/
Diablo inhibits BIRC proteins to favor activation of
caspases for apoptosis.41 Our combination therapy
inactivated Bcl-2 and down-regulated antiapoptotic
NF-jB, BIRC-2 (cIAP1), BIRC-3 (cIAP2), and BIRC-5
(survivin). These data are consistent with a previous
study that demonstrated that Smac/Diablo inhibited
BIRC proteins to promote activation of caspases.41
Our combination therapy activated calpain, caspase-12, caspase-9, and caspase-3 for apoptosis in
U87MG xenografts. Increased activities of calpain
and caspase-3 cleaved a-spectrin to generate 145-kD
SBDP and 120-kD SBDP, respectively. In addition, the
increased activity of caspase-3 cleaved ICAD to
release CAD. The activation of the MAPK pathway
indicated generation of stress in U87MG xenografts
after ATRA plus paclitaxel combination therapy. This
stress could stimulate the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
to liberate Ca21 for activation of the Ca21-dependent

606

cysteine protease calpain, as we reported previously.15
Notably, ER stress is associated with activation of calpain and caspase-12 and the mitochondrial release of
cytochrome c for apoptosis.15,21 Cytosolic cytochrome c
and active caspase-12 are able to directly stimulate activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 for apoptosis.42–44
Another study also showed that paclitaxel activated
caspase-3 for apoptosis.45 We performed immunofluorescent labelings to demonstrate that up-regulation
of calpain, caspase-12, and caspase-3 occurred in
apoptosis in U87MG xenografts after combination
therapy with ATRA plus paclitaxel.
In conclusion, the current investigation showed
that the combination of ATRA plus paclitaxel synergistically induced differentiation and also multiple
molecular mechanisms for the inhibition of survival
signals and the activation of MAP kinases and cysteine proteases for apoptosis in U87MG xenografts.
This combination therapy may be explored as a
potential treatment strategy for glioblastoma in
humans in the near future.
