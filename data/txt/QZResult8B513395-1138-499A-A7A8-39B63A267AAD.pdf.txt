ABSTRACT
Claudin-2 enhances breast cancer liver metastasis and promotes the development
of colorectal cancers. The objective of our current study is to define the regulatory
mechanisms controlling Claudin-2 expression in breast cancer cells.
We evaluated the effect of several Src Family Kinase (SFK) inhibitors or knockdown
of individual SFK members on Claudin-2 expression in breast cancer cells. We also
assessed the potential effects of pan-SFK and SFK-selective inhibitors on the formation
of breast cancer liver metastases.This study reveals that pan inhibition of SFK signaling
pathways significantly elevated Claudin-2 expression levels in breast cancer cells.
In addition, our data demonstrate that pan-SFK inhibitors can enhance breast cancer
metastasis to the liver. Knockdown of individual SFK members reveals that loss of Yes
or Fyn induces Claudin-2 expression; whereas, diminished Lyn levels impairs Claudin-2
expression in breast cancer cells. The Lyn-selective kinase inhibitor, Bafetinib (INNO406), acts to reduce Claudin-2 expression and suppress breast cancer liver metastasis.
Our findings may have major clinical implications and advise against the
treatment of breast cancer patients with broad-acting SFK inhibitors and support
the use of Lyn-specific inhibitors.

together play significant roles in modulating the ability of
cancer cells to seed, colonize and grow in this organ [3].
Together, these parameters greatly influence the selection of
cancer cells that are best suited to thrive in the liver.
Recently, components of tight-junctional complexes
have emerged as key modulators of the metastatic process
[4, 5]. The main functional components of tight junctions
are composed of claudin family members [4], which are
also gaining increasing attention as metastatic regulators
[6]. In colorectal cancer, Claudin-2 levels are elevated and
its expression can be detected in pre-neoplastic conditions,
such as inflammatory bowel disease that pre-dispose to
colon cancer formation [7, 8]. More recently, Claudin-2
has been identified as an important positive modulator of
colon cancer tumorigenicity [9, 10]. Furthermore, Claudin-2
expression has been reported in fibrolamellar hepatocellular,
colorectal and pancreatic adenocarcinomas, as well as in

INTRODUCTION
The liver is a common metastatic site for numerous
cancers, with the most prominent source of hepatic
metastases originating from colorectal and breast tumors
[1]. The formation of liver metastases has a major impact on
cancer-related survival due to the vital functions carried out
by this organ. Excluding brain metastases, the development
of liver metastases is associated with the poorest outcomes
relative to loco-regional, bone or lung metastases [2]. Cancer
cells that arrive in the liver must contend with unique microenvironmental influences that differ markedly from the
primary tumor. These include interactions with specialized
cell types within the liver such as sinusoidal endothelial cells,
Kupffer cells, Hepatic stellate cells, Pit cells and hepatocytes.
Coupled with these new cellular interactions, cancer cells
also encounter unique features of the liver architecture that

liver metastases derived from these cancers [7, 11–13]. In
contrast, Claudin-2 expression has been reported to decrease
in breast cancers of increasing tumor grade and stage,
and low Claudin-2 levels are associated with lymph node
metastasis [14, 15]. However, despite reduced expression
in primary breast cancers, we have recently demonstrated
that Claudin-2 functions as a key mediator of breast cancer
metastasis to the liver [16, 17].
Our previous studies revealed that Claudin-2
expression was selected for in aggressively liver-metastatic
breast cancer cells; whereas, the expression of other cellcell adhesion molecules was decreased [17]. We further
demonstrated that Claudin-2 is functionally involved in liver
metastasis and highly expressed in liver metastases from
breast cancer patients [16, 17]. The mechanisms through
which Claudin-2 enhances breast cancer metastasis to the
liver involve enhanced seeding and early-stage survival
[16]. Indeed, Claudin-2 enables integrin-dependent tumor
cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix components and
integrin-independent tumor cell adhesion to hepatocytes
[16, 17]. Finally, Claudin-2 has recently been described as a
prognostic biomarker able to predict the likelihood of breast
cancer recurrence specifically to the liver [18].
Little is known about the mechanisms that control
Claudin-2 expression in solid cancers. The objective of
our current study is to define the regulatory mechanisms
controlling Claudin-2 expression in breast cancer cells.

the formation of liver metastases [16, 17]. However, little
is known about the mechanisms that govern Claudin-2
expression in breast cancer cells. A previous study has
demonstrated that EGFR-dependent activation of the
MEK/ERK signaling pathway stimulates Claudin-2
expression in colorectal cancer cells [19].
Signaling via the c-Src Family of non-receptor
Kinases (SFK) has been reported to influence cancer
cell morphology, adhesion, migration, invasiveness,
proliferation, differentiation and survival. SFKs propagate
numerous intracellular signals downstream of growth factor
receptors, integrin complexes, steroid hormone receptors,
G protein-coupled receptors and via interactions with
components of the cytoskeleton [20, 21]. Indeed, activation
of Src has been correlated with poor outcomes for patients
with diverse types of cancer [22, 23]. Lyn, a SFK member,
has recently received attention as an important regulator
of signaling in basal/triple negative breast cancers. In this
breast cancer subtype, Lyn expression correlated with poor
survival and increased likelihood of recurrence [24, 25].
We have employed triple negative breast cancer models,
expressing Claudin-2 (MDA-MB-231 and BRC31) [17,
26, 27], to elucidate the role of Claudin-2 as a promoter
of the breast cancer liver metastatic phenotype [16, 17].
Thus, we investigated the involvement of SFKs in the
regulation of Claudin-2 expression and liver metastatic
ability of breast cancer cells. To accomplish this, we treated
breast cancer cells with Dasatinib or PP2, two independent
pharmacological pan-SFK inhibitors. We observed an
increase in Claudin-2 levels when human (Figure 1A) and
mouse (Figure 1B) breast cancer cells were individually
treated with each SFK inhibitor.
We next assessed whether pan-SFK inhibitors
affected transcription of CLDN2 in breast cancer cells. In
agreement with our immunoblotting results, quantitative

real‐time PCR showed that CLDN2 mRNA levels are
increased in both human and mouse breast cancer cells
following treatment with pan-SFK inhibitors (1.73 – 3.33
fold induction for Dasatinib; 6.51 – 30.7 fold induction
for PP2; Supplementary Figure 1A–1D). These results
indicate that an SFK signaling pathway regulates CLDN2
expression at the transcriptional level in breast cancer cells.
The EGFR-MEK-ERK1/2 pathway has been
implicated in the transcriptional regulation of CLDN2
in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells through binding of
the transcription factors, c-Fos and c-Jun, to the human
CLDN2 promoter region via an AP-1 binding site [28].
Phosphorylation of c-Fos (p-c-Fos) leads to stabilization of
this transcription factor and enhanced transcriptional activity
of the AP-1 complex [29]. Therefore, we assessed the effect
of SFK inhibitors on the levels of p-c-Fos in breast cancer
cells. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with
Dasatinib or PP2 resulted in elevated levels of p-c-Fos
(Ser374 and Ser32) and compared to total c-Fos levels,
which remained unchanged (Figure 2A). Similar results
were obtained using 4T1-derived mouse liver-metastatic
breast cancer cells (Figure 2B). Interestingly, we observed
a reduction in p-c-Jun (S63) and total c-Jun levels following
treatment with pan-SFK inhibitors in both human (Figure 2A)
and mouse (Figure 2B) breast cancer cells. These antibodies
do not recognize JunB or JunD, raising the possibility that
these Jun family members could heterodimerize with c-Fos.
We then used chromatin immunoprecipitation assays
to monitor the recruitment of c-Fos to the human CLDN2

promoter in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells following
treatment with SFK inhibitors. As expected, a significant
increase in c-Fos recruitment was observed at the CLDN2
promoter in cells treated with inhibitors compared to
controls (Figure 2C). These results demonstrate that SFKs
act to suppress recruitment of c-Fos to the AP1 binding site
within the human CLDN2 promoter in breast cancer cells,
which is relieved upon treatment with SFK inhibitors.

Dasatinib treatment increases the formation of
breast cancer liver metastases
Given our previous data supporting Claudin-2 as an
important promoter of breast cancer liver metastasis [16, 17],
we assessed the effect of Dasatinib treatment on the formation
of liver metastases following intra-splenic injection of 2776
liver-aggressive breast cancer cells that expressed endogenous
Claudin-2 levels and 2776 cells that had stably reduced
Claudin-2 expression (Figure 3A). We observed that mice
treated with Dasatinib exhibited a 2.6-fold increase in the
number of liver metastases and a 8.3-fold increase in the liver
metastatic burden compared to animals receiving the vehicle
control (Figure 3B and 3C). To determine if the increase in
the liver metastatic burden was dependent on Claudin-2,
we included a cohort of mice that received Dasatinib
treatment but were injected with 2776 liver-aggressive
cells harboring shRNAs targeting Claudin-2. Immunoblot
analysis demonstrated that the presence of the shRNAs
targeting Claudin-2 were able to almost completely suppress

Figure 2: Differential phosphorylation and recruitment of c-Fos containing complexes to the AP1 site of the Claudin-2
promoter are associated with the changes in Claudin-2 expression following treatment with c-Src family kinase (SFK)
inhibitors. Treatment of human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) (A) or the liver metastatic variant (2776) derived from the mouse
4T1 breast cancer cell line (B) with SFK inhibitors results in enhanced c-Fos phosphorylation (p-c-Fos) and elevated Claudin-2 expression.
Diminished c-Jun phosphorylation (p-c-Jun) and total c-Jun levels are observed following treatment of breast cancer cells with SFK
inhibitors. Immunoblots for α-Tubulin served as loading controls. (C) Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments reveal that c-Fos/c-Jun
complexes are enriched on the AP1 site within the CLDN2 promoter in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.

metastatic burden is observed when the control cohort (Par Veh) is compared to the Dasatinib-treated cohort (Par Das) (*, P < 0.015). In
contrast, this effect is lost when a cell population with diminished Claudin-2 expression was injected (C2 KD Das) (**, P < 0.012, Par

the increase in Claudin-2 expression that is normally seen
following Dasatinib treatment (Figure 3A). Interestingly, mice
injected with 2776 breast cancer cells harboring Claudin-2
targeting shRNAs failed to exhibit an elevated liver metastatic
burden in response to Dasatinib treatment (Figure 3B and 3C).
To better understand the increase in the livermetastatic burden following Dasatinib treatment, we
examined the proliferative and apoptotic indices in the
resulting lesions. We observed no differences in the degree
of tumor cell proliferation (Ki67) in liver metastases derived
from mice treated with vehicle or Dasatinib (Supplementary
Figure 2A). Likewise, no statistically significant differences
were observed in the number of apoptotic cells (Cleaved
Caspase-3) within the liver metastases derived from these
cohorts (Supplementary Figure 2B). However, in agreement
with the increase of Claudin-2 expression following
Dasatinib treatment that we observe in vitro (Figure 1B),
immunohistochemical analysis revealed a clear increase in
Claudin-2 positivity within hepatic metastases arising in the
Dasatinib-treated cohort (Supplementary Figure 2C). Thus,
the Dasatinib-induced increase in Claudin-2 expression may
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

promote breast cancer survival and enhanced formation of
liver metastases, as we have described previously [16].

Diminished Lyn expression suppresses Claudin-2
levels while reduction of Fyn or Yes levels enhances
Claudin-2 expression in breast cancer cells
Given the implication of these results for the treatment
of breast cancer patients with pan-SFK inhibitors, we next
investigated the involvement of individual SFK members
(c-Src, Fyn, Yes or Lyn) in the regulation of Claudin-2
expression. To do so, we stably diminished the expression of
each SFK in human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 and
BRC31) using shRNA-mediated approaches (Figure 4). No
major effect on Claudin-2 levels was observed with single
knockdown of c-Src (Figure 4A). However, individual loss
of either Yes or Fyn, the latter not being expressed by BRC31
cells, resulted in a dramatic increase in Claudin-2 expression
(Figure 4B and 4C), which recapitulates the effects seen
with pan-SFK inhibitors (Figure 1A). Similar results were
observed in the 2776 liver-aggressive cell population

(Supplementary Figure 3A and 3B). Intriguingly, decreased
Lyn levels significantly reduced Claudin-2 expression in
human (Figure 4D) and mouse triple-negative breast cancer
cells (Supplementary Figure 3C). We also observed that
individual loss of Yes expression, and to a lesser extent
Fyn, resulted in elevated Lyn levels in both MDA-MB-231
and BRC31 breast cancer cells (Supplementary Figure 4A
and 4B). Taken together our observations reveal a critical
role for Lyn in promoting Claudin-2 expression in breast
cancer cells, highlighting the potential of this specific SFK
family member as an important therapeutic target in the
management of liver metastasis.

breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) developed
in-house (GCRC1735) or a previously described
triple negative breast cancer patient-derived xenograft
(HCI010) [30]. As observed with human (MDA-MB-231
and BRC31) and mouse (2776) breast cancer cells
(Figure 1), we observed an increase in Claudin-2 levels
when GCRC1735 PDX cells were treated with Dasatinib
(Figure 5A). However, no change in Claudin-2 levels was
observed in the HCI010 PDX explant (Figure 5B).
Given the central role Lyn plays in regulating
Claudin-2 expression, kinase inhibitors that specifically
target Lyn could potentially reduce Claudin-2 expression
and breast cancer liver metastasis. Bafetinib is a kinase
inhibitor that is highly selective for Lyn and BCR/ABL
[31–33] and exhibits little activity against other members
of the c-Src Family, with the exception of Lck [34].
Interestingly, Bafetinib treatment dramatically reduced
Claudin-2 levels in both the GCRG1735 or HCI010 PDX
cultures. These data are in agreement with our results using
shRNA-mediated knockdown of Lyn, which resulted in

mice treated with Bafetinib exhibited a 4-fold decrease
in number of hepatic lesions and a 2.3-fold decrease in
the formation of liver metastases compared to animals

observed a slight decrease in tumor cell proliferation (Ki67)
in hepatic metastases derived from 2776 liver-aggressive
breast cancer cells that emerged in mice treatment with
Bafetinib (Supplementary Figure 5A). In contrast, the
degree of apoptosis (Cleaved Caspase-3) was unchanged

metastases from mice treated with Bafetinib compared

reduced Claudin-2 levels in human breast cancer cells
and liver-metastatic mouse breast cancer cells (Figure 6A
and 6B). We next determined whether Bafetinib treatment
would act to suppress the formation of breast cancer liver
metastasis in vivo. Following intra-splenic injection of

to vehicle-treated controls (Supplementary Figure 5C),
which recapitulate our in vitro findings (Figure 6A and
6B). Together, these observations suggest that, in contrast
with the use of Dasatinib (Figure 3), breast cancer patients
may benefit from treatment with Bafetinib to manage the
formation of liver metastases.
Our previous experiments were conducted with one
liver-aggressive cell population (2776) and the Dasatinib
and Bafetinib experiments were conducted in separate
cohorts. To confirm these observations, we assessed the
effect of Dasatinib or Bafetinib treatment on an independent
liver-aggressive breast cancer population (2792). As
expected, we observed an increase in Claudin-2 levels
when cells were treated with Dasatinib and a decrease in
Claudin-2 levels in Bafetinib-treated cells (Supplementary
Figure 6A). Following intra-splenic injection, mice
treated with Dasatinib exhibited a 2.4-fold increase in the
number of liver metastasis and a 3.3-fold increase in the
liver metastatic burden compared to animals receiving the
vehicle control (Supplementary Figure 6B–6D). In contrast,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mice treated with Bafetinib exhibited a 2.1-fold decrease
in the number of liver metastasis and a 3.6-fold decrease
in the liver metastatic burden compared to the cohort that
received vehicle alone (Supplementary Figure 6B–6D).
Together, those observations suggest that treating breast
cancer patients with Dasatinib (pan-SFK) could have the
unanticipated consequence of promoting breast cancer liver
metastasis formation whereas breast cancer patients may
benefit from Bafetinib (Lyn-selective) treatment.

DISCUSSION
Our previous studies demonstrated that Claudin-2 is
functionally involved in breast cancer metastasis to the liver
[16, 17] and a recent independent study has highlighted
the potential of Claudin-2 as a prognostic biomarker that
is able to predict the liver metastatic potential of primary
breast tumors [18]. Our current findings reveal, for the
first time, that signaling via Src family kinases can control
Claudin-2 expression in breast cancer cells.

Using
reporter
assays
and
chromatin
immunoprecipitation approaches, it has recently been
shown that the EGFR-MEK-ERK1/2 pathway can regulate
the transcription of CLDN2 in A549 lung adenocarcinoma
cells [28]. In these cells, activation of the EGFR pathway
led to enhanced binding of the transcription factors, c-Fos
and c-Jun, to the human CLDN2 promoter region via
an AP-1 binding site [28]. Intriguingly, increased AP-1
activity, induced by ectopic overexpression of c-Jun in
SKBR3 breast cancer cells, resulted in a significant increase
in liver metastasis following tail vein injection [35]. Our
current results are in agreement with this mechanism as
the application of pan-SFK pharmacological inhibitors
increased the transcriptional activity of the AP-1 complex,
as measured by the phosphorylation status of c-Fos
(Figure 2A and 2B) and its recruitment to the AP-1 binding
site of the human CLDN2 promoter in breast cancer cells
(Figure 2C). In contrast to lung adenocarcinoma cells or
HER2+ breast cancer cells, we observed no evidence for
a potential partnership role for c-Jun as the total levels
of c-Jun and its phosphorylation (S63) were diminished
in Dasatinib treated cells. Thus, it is conceivable that
CLDN2 expression in triple-negative breast cancer cells
is controlled by an AP-1 complex composed of c-Fos and
another Jun family member, such as Jun B or JunD. These
data demonstrate that the transcription of Claudin-2 can be
regulated through an SFK-c-Fos pathway.
Given the role of this SFK-c-Fos pathway in
regulating Claudin-2 expression, we predicted that panSFK inhibitors would, in fact, enhance breast cancer
metastasis to the liver, through the transcriptional upregulation of Claudin-2. We demonstrate that Dasatinib
administration promotes the liver metastatic ability of
breast cancer cells in pre-clinical mouse models (Figure 3
and Supplementary Figure 6). The Dasatinib-induced
increase in liver metastasis is mediated by Claudin-2
as knockdown of Claudin-2 completely abolishes the
Dasatinib-mediated effect. We did not observe significant
differences in cellular proliferation and apoptosis in liver
metastases treated with Dasatinib, thus, it is likely that
Dasatinib-induced Claudin-2 expression may enhance
the early colonization steps of the liver-metastatic breast
cancer cells as we have previously described [16].
These results are concerning given that SFK
inhibitors have been employed as therapeutic agents in
the setting of triple-negative metastatic breast cancer.
A recent phase II study failed to demonstrate significant
promising results that would justify the use of Saracatinib
as a monotherapy in hormone receptor negative metastatic
breast cancer [36]. In contrast, an independent phase
II study has reported a modest clinical benefit with
Dasatinib, which resulted in a partial response (2 patients)
or stable disease (11 patients) in 43 evaluable patients with
advanced triple-negative breast cancer [37]. Similarly,
a phase II clinical study conducted in 70 patients with
HER2-amplified tumors or estrogen receptor (ER) and/or
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

progesterone receptor (PR)-positive tumors revealed that
nine patients with ER+ and/or PR+ tumors had a partial
response or stable disease when treated with Dasatinib
[38]. Taken together, the results of several Phase II
studies a revealed that Src inhibitors have shown little
efficacy as a monotherapy, and combination strategies are
now underway in the advanced/metastatic setting [39].
In these clinical trials, the endpoints used to assess the
efficacy of Src inhibitors are focused solely on the primary
tumor. Moreover, patients in these studies were typically
followed for up to one year while receiving the inhibitor,
with no long term follow up that would allow the potential
impact of pan-SFK inhibitors on distant recurrences to be
assessed, including the formation of liver metastases.
Pan-SFK inhibitors are known to target a broad
spectrum of molecules. Dasatinib is an ATP competitive
inhibitor of BCR-ABL, ephrin, c-KIT, PDGF receptor
β, and targets all SFK members [40]. In our study, we
have used concentrations below levels that result in offtarget effects, suggesting that Dasatinib is likely targeting
SFKs in our system [41]. PP2 is considered to be a more
specific inhibitor, and has different off target effects, when
compared to Dasatinib [42]. Together, these considerations
argue that members of the SFK are the bone fide targets
in breast cancer cells and raise the intriguing possibility
that specific members of the SFK could be engaged
differentially to regulate Claudin-2 expression, and the
liver metastatic potential, in breast cancer cells.
Indeed, there are several SFK members, which
include c-Src, Yes, Fyn, c-Fgr, Lyn, Lck, Hck, Blk, Yrk
and Frk [43]. However, only a few of these SFK members
are ubiquitous, including c-Src, Yes and Fyn; whereas
others exhibit a more restricted pattern of expression in
non-epithelial cells [43]. In breast cancer cells, loss of
c-Src expression had no effect on Claudin-2 levels whereas
diminished Yes or Fyn expression resulted in a dramatic
upregulation of Claudin-2 levels. Thus, in the context of
breast cancer cells, the dominant effect of PP2 or Dasatinib
appears to be mediated through the inhibition of Yes or Fyn
activity, which leads to higher Claudin-2 expression.
Through the use of Lyn-specific shRNAs and a Lynselective inhibitor, Bafetinib, we have identified Lyn as
a potential therapeutic target to reduce liver metastatic
ability of breast cancer cells. Our data comparing the
effects of Dasatinib (a pan-SFK inhibitor) versus Bafetinib
(a Lyn-selective inhibitor) suggest that specifically
targeting Lyn would be recommended for the management
of liver metastasis. Interestingly, Lyn has recently received
attention as an important regulator of signaling in basal
breast cancers, which represent the breast cancer models
we have utilized in our current work, in which Lyn
expression correlated with poor survival and increased
likelihood of recurrence [24, 25]. Numerous clinical
trials have been completed to assess the effectiveness of
Bafetinib in treating glioma, hormone refractory prostate
cancer or B-CLL patients (NCT01234740, NCT01215799,
9483

Oncotarget

NCT01144260, NCT00352677). To date, none of these
clinical studies have examined the potential effect
of Bafetinib treatment on the development of distant
liver metastasis nor are we aware of any ongoing trials
that plan to examine the efficacy of Bafetinib in the
context of metastatic breast cancer. Our results support
the consideration of Lyn-selective inhibitors, such as
Bafetinib, in the treatment of breast cancer liver metastasis.

shhumanYES1, TRCN0000010006 and TRCN0000121065.
Lentiviral supernatants were generated as described at http://
www.broadinstitute.org/rnai/public/resources/protocols. Pooled
stable populations were maintained under 1.5 μg/ml puromycin
antibiotic selection.

Reagents
Dasatinib (LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA, USA),
PP2 (calbiochem, Gibbstown, NJ, USA) and Bafetinib
(Selleckchem, Houston, TX, USA) were prepared at the
appropriate concentrations using DiMethylSulfOxyde
(DMSO). For all in vitro assays, cells were treated for
18 hours using the following concentrations: Dasatinib:
30 nM; PP2: 10 μM; Bafetinib: 10 μM.

Immunoblotting
Membranes were processed as previously described
[17] and subjected to immunoblot analysis using the
following antibodies: Claudin-2 (0.1 μg/ml; Cat. #: 325600;
Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada), phospho-Src family
kinase (Tyr 416) (0.01 μg/ml; Cat. #: 2101), phospho-cFos (Ser 32) (0.035 μg/ml; Cat. #: 5348), Lyn (0.015 μg/
ml; Cat. #: 2796), Fyn (0.07 μg/ml; Cat. #: 4023), Yes (0.02
μg/ml; Cat. #: 3201) (Cell Signaling, Whitby, ON, Canada),
c-Src (0.4 μg/ml; Cat. #: 05–184; Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA), c-Fos (0.4 μg/ml; Cat. #: sc-253X), phosphoc-Fos (Ser 374) (0.2 μg/ml; Cat. #: sc-81485), c-Jun (0.4
μg/ml; Cat. #: sc-1694X), phospho-c-Jun (Ser63) (0.4 μg/ml;
Cat. #: sc-822) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX,
USA) and α-tubulin (0.5 μg/ml; Cat. #: T9026; Sigma,
Oakville, ON, Canada). Blots were incubated with
horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG secondary
antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Bar
Harbor, ME, USA) and visualized with chemiluminescent
HRP Substrate (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).

Explant cultures
Explant cultures were derived from breast
cancer patient-derived xenografts developed in-house
(GCRC1735) or received as a kind gift from Alana Welm
(HCI010) [30]. Briefly, excess breast tumor tissue from
primary surgery was transported to the laboratory in icecold DMEM/F12, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 1x penicillinstreptomycin, 2.5 μg/ml fungizone. Samples were cut
into 1 mm3 fragments, covered in 50% matrigel, and
transplanted into the mammary fat pad of 5–7 week-old
NOG mice (Taconic, Hudson, NY, USA) under sterile
conditions. When tumors reached 1 cm in the largest
dimension, they were harvested aseptically, minced with
sterile scalpels and dissociated at 37°C for 2–4 hours
on a rotisserie in digestion medium (RPMI, 2.5% FBS,
10 mM HEPES, 1 mg/ml collagenase type IV, 50 μg/ml
gentamicin), 3–5 minutes in 0.25% trypsin/EDTA and then
passed through a 40 μm strainer. GCRC1735 breast tumor

cancer cell line or 2776 cells harbouring shRNAs against
endogenous Claudin-2 (1x104 cells) were injected in the
spleens of 6 to 8-week-old female Balb/c mice (Charles
River, Senneville, QC, Canada) as previously described [17].
Dasatinib (10 mg/kg) was administered daily by oral gavage
in 80 mmol/L citrate buffer, which was also used as vehicle
control. Following splenic injection of the parental 2776
liver-aggressive cells (1x105 cells), Bafetinib (10 mg/kg) was
administered daily by oral gavage in 0.5% methylcellulose,
which was also used as vehicle control. Mice were sacrificed
12 days later and the number of lesion as well as the metastatic
area/tissue area was quantified using Imagescope software
(Aperio, Vista, CA, USA) as previously reported [17].
The mice were housed in facilities managed by the
McGill University Animal Resources Centre and all animal
experiments were conducted under a McGill University
approved Animal Use Protocol in accordance with guidelines
established by the Canadian Council on Animal Care.
