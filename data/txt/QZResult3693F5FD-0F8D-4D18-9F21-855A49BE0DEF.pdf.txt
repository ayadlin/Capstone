Abstract
Inhibition of the survival kinase Akt can trigger apoptosis, and also has been found to activate autophagy,
which may confound tumor attack. In this study, we investigated regulatory mechanisms through which
apoptosis and autophagy were modulated in tumor cells subjected to Akt inhibition by MK-2206, the first
allosteric small molecule inhibitor of Akt to enter clinical development. In human glioma cells, Akt inhibition by
MK-2206 or siRNA-mediated attenuation strongly activated autophagy, whereas silencing of eukaryotic
elongation factor-2 (eEF-2) kinase, a protein synthesis regulator, blunted this autophagic response. Suppression
of MK-2206–induced autophagy by eEF-2 silencing was accompanied by a promotion of apoptotic cell death.
Similarly, siRNA-mediated inhibition of eEF-2 kinase potentiated the efficacy of MK-2206 against glioma cells.
Together, these results showed that blunting autophagy and augmenting apoptosis by inhibition of eEF-2 kinase
could modulate the sensitivity of glioma cells to Akt inhibition. Our findings suggest that targeting eEF-2 kinase
may reinforce the antitumor efficacy of Akt inhibitors such as MK-2206. Cancer Res; 71(7); 2654–63. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Akt/protein kinase B, an oncoprotein with serine/threonine
kinase activity, plays a central role in cell signaling downstream of growth factors. The Akt family consists of Akt1,
Akt2, and Akt3, all of which share a similar domain structure
(1). Aberrant activation of Akt promotes cell growth, survival,
and proliferation, and is associated with cancer development
and progression (2). Thus, Akt represents an attractive target
for therapeutic intervention against cancer. The anticancer
action of Akt inhibitors is believed to result from induction of
apoptosis triggered by Akt inhibition (3). Recently, it has been
found that autophagy, a cellular process that degrades cytoplasmic components via the lysosomal machinery, is also
activated when Akt is inhibited (4, 5). Although activation
of autophagy (also termed type II programmed cell death) can
promote autophagic cell death, this form of intracellular
degradative processes has also been appreciated to support

cell survival (6, 7). Yet, the exact effects of autophagy on the
cytocidal activity of Akt inhibitors, and the functional association of autophagy with apoptosis in response to Akt inhibition,
remain largely unknown, but this knowledge should be useful
to optimizing the use of Akt inhibitors, which are actively
being developed as anticancer agents.
Eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF-2) kinase, also known
as calmodulin-dependent protein kinase III, is a unique calcium/calmodulin-dependent enzyme that regulates protein
synthesis (8). The only known substrate of this kinase is eEF-2,
a 95 kDa protein that promotes ribosomal translocation from
the A site to the P site, the reaction that induces movement of
mRNA along the ribosome during translation in eukaryotic
tissues. eEF-2 kinase phosphorylates eEF-2 on Thr56 and
terminates peptide elongation by decreasing the affinity of
the elongation factor for the ribosome (9). The implication of
eEF-2 kinase in cancer was suggested by the observation that
this kinase is upregulated in various types of neoplasms such
as malignant glioma and breast cancer (10–13), and that
inhibiting this kinase results in a decreased viability of tumor
cells (14). More recently, we have reported that eEF-2 kinase
can act as a positive regulator of autophagy under environmental or metabolic stresses, including nutrient deprivation
(15), growth factor inhibition (16), and energy stress caused by
the glycolytic inhibitor, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (17). As the Aktmediated signaling participates in the regulation of protein
synthesis through mTOR and S6 kinase, a pathway known to
control the activity of eEF-2 kinase, in this study we sought to
determine whether eEF-2 kinase was involved in the activation
of autophagy caused by Akt inhibition, and whether and how
autophagy regulated by this kinase affected the cytocidal

efficacy of MK-2206, a small molecule and allosteric inhibitor
of Akt (18, 19). We found that inhibiting Akt by either MK-2206
or by RNA interference induced an eEF-2 kinase–dependent,
cytoprotective autophagic response, and suppression of eEF-2
kinase enhanced the effectiveness of MK-2206 against glioma
cells by promoting the switch from autophagy to apoptotic
cell death.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture
The human glioblastoma cell lines, T98G and LN-229, were
purchased from and genetically characterized by American
Type Culture Collection. T98G cells were cultured in Ham's F10/DMEM (10:1) medium, and LN-229 cells were cultured in
Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) medium. These

37 C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2/95% air.
All cultures were monitored routinely and found to be free of
contamination by mycoplasma or fungi. All cell lines were
discarded after 3 months and new lines propagated from
frozen stocks.

siRNA transfection
siRNA duplexes targeting eEF-2 kinase, Akt1, Akt2 and Akt3
were prepared by Dharmacon Research. Nonsilencing,
scrambled (nontargeting) siRNA was used as a control. Transfection of siRNA was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells in exponential phase of
growth were plated in 6-well tissue culture plates at 1 
105 cells per well, grown for 24 hours, then transfected with
siRNA by using Oligofectamine and OPTI-MEM I–reduced
serum medium. The concentrations of siRNAs were chosen on
the basis of dose–response studies.
Measurement of autophagy
Autophagy was monitored by using the following methods
as described previously (15, 16): (i) Western blot analysis of
LC3; (ii) microscopic observation of green fluorescent pro-

tein (GFP)-LC3 puncta; (iii) flow cytometry analysis of AO
staining for acidic organelles; (iv) electron microscopic
examination of double- or multimembrane vacuoles in the
cytoplasm.
Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed in M-PER mammalian protein extraction
reagent (Thermo Scientific) supplemented with a protease
inhibitor cocktail (Roche) at room temperature for 5 minutes
followed by centrifugation at 14,000  g for 10 minutes.
Protein concentrations of the cell lysates were measured by
the Bio-Rad DC assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins (20–40 mg) were
resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The blots were incubated
with indicated antibodies in 3% bovine serum albumin/
Tris-buffered saline Tween-20 at 4 C for overnight followed
by incubation with secondary antibodies at room temperature
for 1 hour. The protein signals were detected by enhanced
chemiluminescence method.
Apoptosis assays
Apoptosis was determined by the following procedures.
Flow cytometric analysis of Annexin V and 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) staining. Briefly, 100 mL Guava
Nexin reagent (Millipore) was added to 1  105 cells (in
100 mL) and the cells were incubated with the reagent for
20 minutes at room temperature in the dark. At the end of
incubation, the cells were analyzed by a Guava EasyCyte Plus
Flow Cytometry System (Millipore).
Flow cytometric analysis of activated caspases. The
Guava multi-caspase assay protocol (Millipore) was followed.
Briefly, 10 mL of the Guava caspase detection reagent (Millipore) was added to 1  105 cells (in 100 mL) and the cells were
incubated for 1 hour at 37 C in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2/95% air. At the end of incubation, the cells
were washed twice with washing buffer, resuspended in 200
mL of the caspase/7-AAD working solution (Millipore), and
then further incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature.
Populations of cells with activated caspases were analyzed on
an EasyCyte Plus Flow Cytometry System (Millipore).
Measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential
Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured by flow
cytometry following JC-1 staining. Briefly, 4 mL of Guava cell
staining solution (including JC-1 and MitoPotential 7-AAD)
from Millipore was added to 2  105 cells (in 200 mL) and the
cells were incubated with the reagent for 30 minutes at a 37 C
in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2/95% air. At the
end of incubation, the cells were analyzed by a Guava EasyCyte
Plus Flow Cytometry System.
Detection of ROS
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was measured by
flow cytometry. Briefly, treated cells were collected and incubated with 10 mmol/L of DCF-DA for 30 minutes at 37 C in a
humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2/95% air. At the end
of incubation, the samples were analyzed on an EasyCyte Plus
Flow Cytometry System.

Cellular viability assay
Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. Briefly, cells were
plated at 5103 cells per well in 96-well tissue culture plates
and incubated at 37 C in a humidified atmosphere containing
5% CO2/95% air. The formazan product, formed after 4-hour
incubation with MTT, was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
and read at 570 nm on a Victor3 Multi Label plate reader
(PerkinElmer).
Animal study
All animal experiments were performed according to the
protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee at The Pennsylvania State University. Briefly, 4- to
6-week-old female nude mice were inoculated subcutaneously
with LN229 cells (5  106 cells/per site) with or without
silencing of eEF-2 kinase. At day 7 after inoculation, MK2206 (120 mg/kg, p.o.) was administered to the tumor-bearing
mice. Tumors were harvested 24 hours after drug administration for analysis of autophagy and apoptosis. Apoptosis was
measured by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–
mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) tetramethylrhodamine red apoptosis kit from Roche, and by using Western
blot analysis of cleaved caspase 3. Autophagy was detected by
Western blot analysis of LC3 II.
Statistical analysis
The difference between the samples with silencing of eEF-2
kinase and the samples without silencing of the enzyme, or the
samples with inhibition of autophagy and the samples without
inhibition of autophagy, were analyzed by a 2-sample t test.

Results
Inhibition of Akt activates an eEF-2 kinase–dependent
autophagy in glioma cells
Inhibition of Akt can trigger apoptosis, and this is believed
to account for the antitumor effect of Akt inhibitors. To better
understand how inhibiting Akt produces antitumor actions
and the possible influence of autophagy, we examined the
effects of the Akt inhibitor, MK-2206 (18), on the level of LC3 II,
a hallmark of autophagy. We observed that treatment with
MK-2206 caused a robust, concentration-dependent activation of autophagy in human glioma cell lines LN229 and T98G,
as evidenced by an increase in the amount of LC3 II (Fig. 1A).
LC3 II level was also elevated in the presence of bafilomycin
A1, an inhibitor of autophagosome–lysosome fusion and LC3
II degradation, indicating that autophagic flux was enhanced
by this Akt inhibitor (Fig. 1B). The stimulatory effect of MK2206 on autophagy was confirmed by an increase in the GFPLC3 dots in the cells treated with the drug, as examined by
GFP-LC3 puncta formation assay (Fig. 1C), by an increase in
the AO staining for acidic vesicular organelles (Fig. 1D), and by
an increase in autophagosomes as observed by electron
microscopy (Fig. 1E). We have identified eEF-2 kinase as a
regulator of autophagy under environmental or metabolic
stress (15–17). Here, we asked whether the activity of this
kinase also affected autophagy induced by Akt inhibition. As
shown in Figure 2A and B, MK-2206 not only activated eEF-2

2656

kinase in a concentration-dependent manner, as shown by
increased phosphorylation of eEF-2 (Fig. 2A), the substrate for
the enzyme, but also correspondingly induced autophagy in
LN229 and T98G cells (Fig. 2B). To prove the role of eEF-2
kinase in activation of autophagy by MK-2206, we carried out
paralleled experiments in the cells with silencing of the
expression of eEF-2 kinase. Figure 2B shows that when
eEF-2 kinase was silenced, there was a decrease in the
amounts of LC3 II and an increase in the amounts of p62,
a selective substrate of macroautophagy, as compared with
the cells without silencing of the kinase, indicating that
autophagic response to MK-2206 treatment was blunted by
inactivation of eEF-2 kinase.
To corroborate the involvement of eEF-2 kinase in the Akt
inhibition–activated autophagy and to assess whether the
effect of inhibiting Akt on autophagy was isozyme-selective,
we silenced the expression of Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3, using the
siRNAs specific for each of these Akt isozymes. We found that
respective silencing of Akt1, Akt2, or Akt3 expression all
caused an increase in the amount of LC3 II (Fig. 2C), indicating
that inhibition of each of these isozymes contributes to
induction of autophagy. Depletion of eEF-2 kinase by siRNA
also blunted autophagy induced by knockdown of all these Akt
isozymes (Fig. 2C), providing further support for a role of this
enzyme in mediating autophagy activated by Akt inhibition.
The TSC2/mTOR/S6 kinase/eEF-2 kinase pathway is
involved in activation of autophagy by MK-2206
To explore the pathways that mediate the effect of eEF-2
kinase on Akt inhibition–induced autophagy, we knocked
down TSC2, a tumor suppressor protein that is negatively
regulated by Akt and suppresses mTOR activity (20). As shown
in Figure 3, knockdown of TSC2 led to a reduction in the
amount of LC3 II in the cells treated with MK-2206, in comparison with the nontargeting controls (Fig. 3A). Concomitantly,
knockdown of TSC2 also resulted in a decreased activity of eEF2 kinase (decreased phospho-eEF-2), an increased activity of S6
kinase (increased phospho-S6 kinase) and mTOR (increased
phospho-mTOR; Fig. 3B). These results suggest that induction
of autophagy by Akt inhibition is mediated via the TSC2/
mTOR/S6 kinase/eEF-2 kinase pathway.
Silencing of eEF-2 kinase augments apoptosis in glioma
cells subjected to Akt inhibition
As the pro-survival or pro-death role of autophagy in
stressed cells is often associated with alteration of apoptosis,
we next queried whether there was a functional relationship
between apoptosis and the eEF-2 kinase–mediated autophagy
when Akt was inhibited. We compared the degree of apoptosis
in the MK-2206–treated glioma cells with or without silencing
of eEF-2 kinase. As shown in Figure 4A and B, MK-2206 caused
a concentration-dependent increase in apoptosis in the treated cells, as manifested by increases in Annexin V staining
(Fig. 4A) and in activated pan-caspases (Fig. 4B); notably,
silencing of eEF-2 kinase strengthened the apoptogenic effect
of MK-2206 in the glioma cells (Fig. 4A and B).
Hypoxic microenvironments of solid tumors are believed to
be linked to the malignant features, including poor response

eEF-2 kinase–mediated autophagy could also sensitize
hypoxic glioma cells to the apoptogenic effect of MK-2206.
As shown in Figure 4C, under hypoxic condition, MK-2206
induced a stronger autophagic response and higher eEF-2

to in vivo circumstance, we inoculated mice with LN229 cells

showed an increase of apoptosis in tumor specimens with
knockdown of eEF-2 kinase (Fig. 4F, bottom). These in vivo
tests were performed by a nonorthotopic xenograft model,
and it remains to be shown that these findings are relevant to
glioma in an orthotopic setting.
Mitochondrial ROS is a mediator of the MK-2206–
stimulated autophagy and apoptosis
To understand the mechanism governing the functional
connection between autophagy and apoptosis in the MK2206–treated tumor cells and the role of eEF-2 kinase in these
cellular processes, we determined the effects of MK-2206 and
eEF-2 kinase on mitochondrial integrity and ROS production,
as mitochondria and ROS play an important role in the
regulation of both apoptosis and autophagy (21, 22). As shown
in Figure 5A and B, treatment of LN229 or T98G cells with MK2206 impaired the mitochondrial integrity, as evidenced by a
decline in mitochondrial membrane potential (Dym; Fig. 5A)
and an increase in release of cytochrome c into cytosol
(Fig. 5B). Knockdown of eEF-2 kinase aggravated the MK2206–induced loss of mitochondrial integrity (Fig. 5A and B).
MK-2206 also stimulated the generation of ROS (Fig. 5C and
D), and knockdown of eEF-2 kinase further increased the
production of ROS (Fig. 5D). The overproduction of ROS
appeared to be, at least partially, responsible for activation
of both autophagy and apoptosis, as cotreatment with MK2206 and the ROS scavenger, N-acetyl cystein (NAC), weakened the stimulatory effect of MK-2206 on both autophagy

2658

(Fig. 5E) and apoptosis (Fig. 5F). Because mitochondria are a
source of ROS production, to further show the importance of
the mitochondria in the MK-2206–induced autophagy and
apoptosis and the role of the eEF-2 kinase–regulated autophagy in mitigating cellular stress, we compared the level of the
mitochondrial marker cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COX
IV), a specific marker for mitochondria, in the MK-2206–
treated cells with or without silencing of eEF-2 kinase. Figure
5G shows that silencing of eEF-2 kinase, which can suppress
autophagy (Figs. 2 and 4), rescued the decreases of COX IV in
cells treated with MK-2206, suggesting that suppression of
autophagy slowed down the degradation of the damaged
mitochondria. The results shown in Figure 5H demonstrated
an increase of the amount of LC3 II mainly in the mitochondrial fraction of the MK-2206–treated cells, verifying the
mitochondrial autophagy that was activated by MK-2206.
Suppression of autophagy via inhibiting eEF-2 kinase
enhances the cytocidal effect of MK-2206 in human
glioma cells
To evaluate whether the eEF-2 kinase–mediated autophagy
has an impact on the antitumor action of Akt inhibitors, we
determined the effects of inhibiting eEF-2 kinase and autophagy on viability of the glioma cells treated with MK-2206. We
found that the cytotoxicity of MK-2206 against T98G and
LN229 cells was significantly greater when eEF-2 kinase was
silenced, as compared with that in the cells transfected with a
nontargeting RNA (Fig. 6A). Figure 6B shows that enhanced

sensitivity to MK-2206 was also achieved in glioma cells
cotreated with 0.25 mmol/L of a small molecule inhibitor of
eEF-2 kinase, NH125 (14). To ascertain that the reinforcing
effect of inhibiting eEF-2 kinase on cytocidal activity of MK2206 was attributed to suppression of autophagy, we tested
MK-2206 in the glioma cells, in which autophagy was
suppressed by either silencing of beclin 1, a key autophagy
regulator, or by use of 3-MA, a chemical inhibitor of autophagy. We observed that the cytocidal activity of MK-2206 was
also markedly increased in the cells subjected to silencing of
beclin 1 expression (Fig. 6C) or with the treatment of 1 mmol/
L of 3-MA (Fig. 6D), suggesting that inhibition of autophagy
can indeed sensitize tumor cells to the Akt inhibitor, MK-2206.

Discussion
What exact roles autophagy plays in response of tumor cells
to cancer therapies, what signaling pathways are involved in
the regulation of autophagy, and how to exploit autophagy in
devising novel strategies for cancer therapy, are the questions
being actively and extensively investigated. Inhibiting Akt, a
serine/threonine kinase mediating mitogenic and antiapoptotic responses that result from activation of multiple signaling cascades, has been shown to induce autophagy (4, 5) and
to promote apoptotic cell death and suppress proliferation
and growth of tumor cells (23); yet, whether and how autop-

www.aacrjournals.org

hagy affects the efficacy of Akt inhibitors, a promising and new
class of cancer therapeutic agents, remains poorly understood.
The results of this study informs that autophagy induced by
Akt inhibition can indeed affect the cytotoxicity of Akt inhibitors, and that manipulating autophagic activity can modulate sensitivity of tumor cells to the cytocidal effect of Akt
inhibitors. We show that, like other Akt inhibitors (5), the
novel allosteric Akt inhibitor, MK-2206, could induce autophagy in tumor cells (Figs. 1, 2B, 3A, and 4C). Moreover, we
show in this study that autophagy induced by Akt inhibition
was cytoprotective and could mitigate the cytotoxicity of the
Akt inhibitor, as blunting autophagic response by either
genetic or pharmacologic approaches could enhance the
cytocidal efficacy of MK-2206 (Fig. 6) and the apoptotic cell
death induced by the compound (Fig. 4). Furthermore, we
revealed that eEF-2 kinase, a unique calcium/calmodulindependent enzyme that regulates protein synthesis and is
overexpressed in malignant gliomas and other malignancies,
played an essential role in regulating autophagy that is activated by Akt inhibition (Fig. 2), and this regulatory role
appeared to be mediated through the TSC2/mTOR/S6 kinase
pathway (Fig. 3). We have previously reported that eEF-2
kinase serves as a central component of the mammalian
macroautophagy pathway that is activated in response to
environmental or metabolic stress (15–17). This study further
underscores the importance of this kinase as a regulator of

autophagy. However, the precise molecular mechanism by
which eEF-2 kinase controls autophagy is yet to be defined.
As reported previously (3–5) and shown in this study (Figs.
1, 2, and 4), inhibition of Akt can induce both autophagy and
apoptosis; nevertheless, how apoptosis and autophagy affect
cellular sensitivity to Akt inhibitors remains unclear. Our
observation indicates that the Akt inhibition–activated autophagy plays a protective role in tumor cells, as suppression of
autophagy can enhance the cytocidal activity of the Akt
inhibitor, MK-2206. Then, is there a functional association
between autophagy and apoptosis in cells subjected to Akt
inhibition, and how is the interplay between these 2 cellular
processes controlled? To answer these questions, we exam-

ined the effects of MK-2206 and eEF-2 kinase activity on level
of ROS, a critical regulator of both apoptosis and autophagy,
and on integrity of mitochondria, which are both source and
target of ROS. We found that MK-2206 increased ROS level in a
concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5C, top) and enhanced
mitochondrial permeability (Fig. 5A and B) in the treated
tumor cells. Thus, loss of mitochondrial integrity and overproduction of ROS may account for activation of apoptosis;
also, excess of ROS and activation of the TSC2/mTOR/S6
kinase/eEF-2 kinase pathway (Fig. 3B) both may contribute
to induction of autophagy, which appears to favor cell survival.
Of note, when autophagy was blunted by inhibition of eEF-2
kinase, degradation of the damaged mitochondria was

tion of protein synthesis (16, 17), and depletion of the cellular
ATP can also impair mitochondrial function and facilitate ROS
generation, which, consequently, can elicit more apoptotic cell
death. This may explain the augmentation of MK-2206 cytotoxicity by inhibiting eEF-2 kinase, which was observed in this
study. It is likely that ROS serves as a mediator in these cellular

processes, as NAC, a ROS scavenger, could block the autophagy (Fig. 5E) and apoptosis (Fig. 5F) activated by MK-2206,
although not completely, probably due to the dual effects of
ROS on autophagy and apoptosis. On the basis of the results of
this study, we believe that eEF-2 kinase could act as an
essential regulator controlling the switch between autophagy
and apoptosis in cells experiencing cellular insults such as Akt
inhibition, and that a previously unidentified and important
pathway that regulates the cross-talk between autophagy and
apoptosis and modulates cellular sensitivity to Akt inhibitors,
as is depicted in Figure 7, might emerge.
Because of the central role of Akt in oncogenic signaling
and in tumor progression, Akt is considered one of the
major targets for development of anticancer drugs. In fact,

several inhibitors of Akt are being tested in clinic as
promising cancer therapeutic agents (24–26); nevertheless,
these compounds seem to have limited activity as a single
agent. Strategies for reinforcing the activity of the Akt
inhibitors would make this type of drugs more valuable
in treatment of cancer. Our findings that suppression of the
eEF-2 kinase–mediated autophagy can promote apoptotic
cell death and augment the cytotoxicity of MK-2206, even
under hypoxic condition, may provide a rationale for
designing new and more effective therapeutic intervention
for treatment of malignant tumors such as gliomas, that is,
combining an Akt inhibitor with an eEF-2 kinase inhibitor
to shuttle cells into more reliable and permanent pathways
of cell death. Evaluation of this strategy in preclinical

glioma and other tumor models is underway. Considering
that MK-2206 is now under clinical development as a new
anticancer agent, and that we have already identified an
inhibitor of eEF-2 kinase (14), the results reported here may
have translational potentials and a direct impact on cancer
therapy.
In summary, the results reported here show that suppressing autophagy and augmenting apoptosis via inhibition of
eEF-2 kinase can modulate sensitivity of tumor cells to Akt
inhibition, and suggest that eEF-2 kinase may be utilized as an
effective target for reinforcing the antitumor efficacy of Akt
inhibitors such as MK-2206.
