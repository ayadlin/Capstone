Abstract
Background—Capecitabine with oxaliplatin (CAPOX) has previously demonstrated clinical
activity in patients with small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA) and ampullary adenocarcinoma
(AAC). We conducted a phase II trial to evaluate the benefit of adding bevacizumab to CAPOX.

Author Manuscript

Patients and Methods—In this phase II, single-arm, single-center, open-label study, we
recruited patients aged 18 years and older with untreated advanced SBA or AAC. Patients received
capecitabine 750 mg/m2 orally twice daily on days 1–14, oxaliplatin 130mg/m2 intravenously on
day 1 and bevacizumab 7.5mg/kg intravenously on day 1 on a 21-day cycle. The primary endpoint
was progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months. Secondary objectives included response rate
(RR), overall PFS, overall survival (OS) and toxicity.

Author Manuscript

Results—Between August 2011 and November 2014, 30 patients were enrolled into the study
(M/F 13/17, median age: 63 years [range: 33–78], ECOG PS 0/1/2: 7/20/3). 23 patients (77%) had
SBA (18 duodenal, 5 jejunal/ileal) and 7 patients had AAC (5 pancreaticobiliary subtype, 1 mixed
subtype, 1 intestinal subtype). The most common grade 3 toxicities observed were fatigue and
hypertension (7 [23%] patients each), neutropenia (6 [20%] patients), and diarrhea (3 [10%]
patients). The probability of PFS at 6 months was 68% (95% confidence interval [CI] 52% to
88%). The RR was 48.3% with 1 complete response and 13 partial responses; 10 patients had
stable disease. At a median follow-up of 25.9 months, median PFS was 8.7 (95% CI 4.9–10.5)
months and median OS was 12.9 (95% CI 9.2–19.7) months.

Conclusions—Our results indicate that CAPOX with bevacizumab is an active and welltolerated regimen for patients with SBA and AAC. These findings support the need for further
investigation into the clinical benefit of targeting angiogenesis in SBA and AAC.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA) and ampullary adenocarcinoma (AAC) are rare tumors.
The estimated incidence of small bowel cancer in the United States for 2016 is 10,090
patients, of which approximately 40% will be adenocarcinomas [1, 2]. The vast majority of
patients present with late stage disease, which in part relates to frequent delays in diagnosis
[2]. Although there are no randomized clinical trials comparing the efficacy of various
chemotherapy regimens in patients with SBA, there have been four prospective studies, three
of which used fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin as the backbone chemotherapy [3, 4, 5, 6].
We have previously demonstrated that capecitabine with oxaliplatin (CAPOX) is a safe and
effective regimen for treatment of both advanced SBA and AAC [4].

Author Manuscript

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a key role in tumor-associated
neoangiogenesis, which helps provide a tumor with oxygen, nutrition and supports the
development of metastasis [7]. We have previously conducted immunohistochemical
staining for VEGF-A on 54 SBA tumor samples and found that VEGF-A is expressed in
96% of patients [8]. Another study noted universal expression of VEGF-A mRNA in 56
SBA samples at significantly higher levels compared with levels in adjacent normal
intestinal mucosa [9]. The role of VEGF targeted agents has not been prospectively studied
in the treatment of SBA and AAC.

Author Manuscript

Bevacizumab is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved recombinant humanized
monoclonal IgG antibody that binds to VEGF-A and prevents its binding to receptors on
endothelial and cancer cells [10]. The combination of CAPOX and bevacizumab has been
extensively studied in colorectal cancer (CRC) and has been FDA approved for first-line
treatment of metastatic CRC. A phase III study comparing bevacizumab plus FOLFOX/
CAPOX against placebo plus FOLFOX/CAPOX demonstrated similar rates of grade 3–4
toxicity, however, the addition of bevacizumab improved outcomes with median
progression-free survival (PFS) of 9.4 months with bevacizumab compared to 8 months with
placebo [11]. Given the high VEGF-A expression in metastatic SBA and AAC taken
together with the benefit noted with addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy in metastatic
CRC, we hypothesized that the addition of bevacizumab to CAPOX chemotherapy would
improve anti-cancer activity and improve outcome for patients with these malignancies.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients

Author Manuscript

All eligible patients were required to have histologically confirmed SBA or AAC;
measurable metastatic disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) criteria [12]; ECOG performance status of 0 to 2; and adequate hematologic
(absolute neutrophil count [ANC] ≥1,500/μl, platelets ≥100,000/μl), hepatic (total bilirubin
≤1.5 times the upper limit of normal, AST and ALT <3 times the upper limit of normal) and
renal function (creatinine clearance >50mL/min). Prior adjuvant chemotherapy (including 5fluorouracil [FU], capecitabine and oxaliplatin) was allowed if completed ≥ 52 weeks prior
and previous capecitabine or 5-FU administered as a radiosensitizing agent was allowed. A
minimum of 4 weeks must have elapsed from completion of any prior chemotherapy,
radiotherapy or surgery. Patients with any of the following were not eligible to participate in
this study: prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease, a known history of dihydropyrimidine
deficiency, peripheral neuropathy of grade 3 or greater, inadequately controlled hypertension
(systolic blood pressure >140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg) or history
of hypertensive crisis/encephalopathy, NYHA grade II or greater congestive heart failure,
and myocardial infarction or unstable angina or cerebrovascular accident or transient
ischemic attack or significant vascular disease within 6 months. The University of Texas MD
Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC) Institutional Review Board approved this study
protocol and all patients gave written informed consent.
Study Design

Author Manuscript

The study was an open-label, single arm, single-institution, phase II study conducted at
UTMDACC. Treatment consisted of intravenous oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2) administered on
day 1, intravenous bevacizumab (7.5mg/kg) administered on day 1, and oral capecitabine
(1500 mg/m2) divided twice daily on days 1–14 of each treatment cycle. Treatment cycles
were repeated every 21 days and imaging studies were conducted every 3 cycles. Treatment
was continued until progression of disease, inter-current illness preventing further
administration of treatments, severe predefined treatment related toxicities or treatment
delay of more than four weeks due to toxicity.
Dose Reductions

Author Manuscript

Toxicity was graded according to the NCI CTCAE version 4.0 except for neurosensory and
skin toxicity. Neurosensory toxicity was graded according to the Neurologic Toxicity Scale
for Oxaliplatin Dose Adjustments. Neurosensory toxicity did not result in dose reduction for
capecitabine or bevacizumab. A new cycle of chemotherapy with capecitabine, oxaliplatin,
and bevacizumab was delayed until the ANC was ≥ 1000/mm3, the platelet count was ≥
75,000/mm3 and recovery was achieved from any treatment-related non-hematological
toxicity (except alopecia, and oxaliplatin-related neurosensory toxicity) to baseline or was ≤
grade 1.
Capecitabine was interrupted during a cycle for grades 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity
(excluding anemia) or for ≥ grade 2 non-hematologic toxicity (excluding grade 2 nausea or
vomiting). Capecitabine dosage was reduced 25% for grade 2 hand-foot syndrome and 50%

for grade 3 hand-foot syndrome; 25% for grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity and 50% for
grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity; and 25% for a delay in hematologic recovery of ≥ 1 week
(excluding anemia). Oxaliplatin dosage was reduced by 25% for grades 3 or 4 hematologic
toxicity (excluding anemia), grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity (excluding hand-foot
syndrome), a delay in hematologic recovery of ≥ 1 week (excluding anemia), or paresthesias
with pain or functional impairment ≥ 7 days. Oxaliplatin was discontinued if paresthesias
with pain or functional impairment persisted throughout a cycle. Patients were allowed to
continue on study after oxaliplatin discontinuation. Two dose reductions were allowed for
capecitabine and oxaliplatin. If a third reduction was required, the patient was removed from
the study. There were no dose adjustments for bevacizumab.
Statistical Analysis

Author Manuscript

The primary end point was PFS at 6 months. PFS was defined as the interval between start
of treatment to the date of first documentation of progression or symptomatic deterioration
or death due to any cause. A previous study with 25 patients treated with CAPOX alone
showed that PFS at six months is 52% [4]. The accrual goal was 30 patients. This sample
size ensured that, if the trial is not terminated early, a posterior 90% confidence interval (CI)
of PFS at 6 months would be (0.52–0.79), assuming that PFS at 6 months would be 0.67
(20/30) with the new treatment.

Author Manuscript

Secondary end points included response rate (RR), overall PFS, overall survival (OS) and
toxicity. Responses were determined according to RECIST criteria in all evaluable patients.
Toxicity data were analyzed in all patients who received at least one dose of study
medication. For the unplanned exploratory analysis, we analyzed historical data from the
metastatic cohort (n=25) from our previous CAPOX study [4]. Both sets of patients, current
and historical, had metastatic disease.
OS was defined as the time from first study treatment to date of death or last follow-up.
Comparisons were conducted using Wilcoxon rank sum test, Fisher exact test or Log rank
test. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate unadjusted OS and PFS time distributions.
All computations were carried out in SAS version 9.4 and TIBCO Spotfire S+ version 8.2.

RESULTS

Author Manuscript

Between August 2011 and November 2014, 30 patients with advanced SBA or AAC were
enrolled. The baseline characteristics of the study population are listed in Table 1. The
median age of the study population was 63 years. Twenty three patients (77%) had SBA (18
of duodenal origin and 5 of jejunal/ileal origin) while seven patients (23%) had AAC (5
pancreatobiliary subtype, 1 intestinal subtype, 1 mixed subtype). Poorly differentiated
histology was present in 60% of patients and mucinous histology was present in 16.7%.
Inflammatory bowel disease was present in one patient, while none of the patients had a
known history of Lynch syndrome.
Outcomes related to the efficacy of this regimen are listed in Table 2. The primary end point
for this study was PFS at 6 months. The probability of PFS at 6 months with CAPOXbevacizumab was 68% (95% CI 52%–88%; 90% CI: 54%–84%). Secondary end-points

included ORR, overall PFS and OS. The ORR was 48.3% with 1 complete response (CR)
and 13 partial responses (PR). Ten patients had stable disease (SD). The one inevaluable
patient received one cycle of study treatment for metastatic duodenal adenocarcinoma, but
due to the development of duodenal obstruction and biliary obstruction with subsequent
decline in performance status, the patient was deemed not a candidate for additional
chemotherapy. Figure 1 depicts a waterfall plot of best tumor response per RECIST criteria.
The patient with CR was an AAC patient with pancreatobiliary subtype who developed a CR
in multiple liver metastases following 12 cycles of CAPOX and bevacizumab and remained
in CR for an additional 10 months. A second patient with duodenal adenocarcinoma
developed radiographic resolution of extensive mesenteric and retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy but due to an elevated tumor marker is categorized as PR and currently
remains on study at 15 months from study start. The RR was similar between SBA (50%)
and AAC (43%). Of the five patients with pancreatobiliary subtype AAC, one patient had
CR as noted above, another patient had PR while the remaining three patients had SD as
their best response to treatment with CAPOX and bevacizumab. Meanwhile, best response
achieved by the patient with intestinal subtype AAC was PR and best response achieved by
the patient with mixed subtype AAC was SD.
At a median follow-up of 25.9 months, the median PFS was 8.7 months (95% CI: 4.9–10.5
months; 90% CI: 6.5–10.3 months) and the median OS was 12.9 months (95% CI: 9.2–19.7
months; 90% CI 10.5–17.2 months) (Figure 2; Table 2). Three patients currently remain on
study.

Author Manuscript

The most common treatment-related grade 1–4 adverse events are listed in Table 3.
Treatment was well tolerated, with the most common grade 3 toxicities of fatigue (7, 23%),
hypertension (7, 23%), neutropenia (6, 20%), and diarrhea (3, 10%). Common grade 2
toxicities were anorexia (15, 50%), fatigue (14, 47%), and nausea (11, 37%). Only 1 grade 4
toxicity occurred; this patient developed grade 4 neutropenia after 8 cycles of treatment.
There were no treatment related deaths.
An exploratory analysis comparing the current study to the 25 patient metastatic cohort from
our prior phase II CAPOX study was performed. As shown in Supplemental Table 1, there
were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics of the study populations
involved in both studies. Statistical analysis demonstrated no significant difference in RR
(48.3% vs. 52%, p=0.79) or PFS (8.7 months vs. 6.6 months; p=0.73; hazard ratio 1.125,
95% CI 0.585–2.163) between CAPOX with bevacizumab vs. CAPOX alone (Supplemental
Figure 1).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrated that the combination of CAPOX with bevacizumab is an
active regimen with an ORR of 48.3%, median PFS of 8.7 months and median OS of 12.9
months. Treatment was well tolerated with the most common grade 3 toxicities of fatigue
(23%), hypertension (23%), neutropenia (20%) and diarrhea (10%). Our findings
demonstrate that CAPOX with bevacizumab is a safe and efficacious combination for

patients with advanced SBA or AAC. This is the first prospective clinical trial evaluating the
use of targeted therapies in SBA and AAC.
Based on phase II clinical trials and retrospective data, the standard first-line treatment
regimen for SBA is a combination of a fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin [3, 4, 5, 6]. The
results from phase II studies of CAPOX and FOLFOX appear similar with response rates of
39 to 52% and a median PFS of 7.8 to 11.3 months [4, 6]. Recently, the addition of
irinotecan to CAPOX was explored, resulting in a median PFS of 8.7 months and median OS
of 12.7 months [5]. The results from our study appear similar to these prior studies. In
addition, toxicity was similar to prior studies with this treatment combination and despite the
presence of intact small bowel primaries in 60% of study patients, there were no episodes of
bowel perforation.

Given its rarity and proximity to the large bowel, SBA has often been treated in a similar
manner to CRC [2]. However, there are a number of epidemiological and molecular
differences between SBA and CRC. According to Surveillance, Epidemiology and End
Results program data, stage IV disease is present in 32% of SBA cases in contrast to 20% of
CRC cases [13]. Furthermore, poor differentiation is present in 33% of SBA cases in
contrast to 21% of CRC cases [13]. The incidence of these malignancies is diverging, with
the incidence of SBA increasing and that of CRC declining in the United States [2]; it should
be noted, however, that there is no routine screening for SBA and AAC while there are strict
screening guidelines for CRC. Additionally, recent work has demonstrated that the stagestratified cancer-specific survival rate was worse for patients with SBA than for those with
CRC [13]. Although less is known about the molecular basis of SBA, the rate of APC
mutations is markedly less, ranging from 7–13%, in contrast to 60–68% in CRC [2].
SMAD4 mutations are more common in SBA (30%) compared to CRC (5–16%) [2]. BRAF
V600E mutations are very rare in SBA with one study finding no BRAF mutations in 99
cases [14]. The rate of KRAS mutations (codons 12 and 13) in SBA (40–60%) is
comparable to CRC [2]. Taken together, such fundamental differences support continued
efforts to better understand this malignancy and determine the optimal treatment approach.

Author Manuscript

An exploratory analysis comparing the current study with a preceding phase II clinical trial
of CAPOX alone in SBA and AAC conducted at the same institution demonstrated no
significant difference in RR or PFS. However, it is important to note that both studies
enrolled a limited number of patients and were not designed or powered to detect differences
between the two regimens. The benefit of addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy in CRC
has been demonstrated in several large randomized trials. The most recent NO16966 phase
III clinical trial comparing bevacizumab or placebo combined with FOLFOX/CAPOX in the
first-line setting demonstrated that the addition of bevacizumab improved outcome with
median PFS of 9.4 months with bevacizumab compared with 8 months with placebo (HR
0.83, p=0.0023) [11]. Median OS was 21.3 months in the bevacizumab group and 19.9
months in the placebo group (HR 0.89, p=0.077). Response rates were similar in both arms,
47% in the bevacizumab group and 49% in the placebo group (p=0.31). Interestingly, phase
III clinical trials in gastric cancer have not demonstrated a benefit with the addition of
bevacizumab. The AVAGAST phase III clinical trial comparing bevacizumab or placebo
combined with cisplatin/capectitabine in the first-line setting failed to meet its primary end-

point, with a median OS of 12.1 months with bevacizumab compared with 10.1 months with
placebo (HR 0.87, p=0.1002) [15]. Median PFS was significantly improved from 5.3 months
with placebo to 6.7 months with bevacizumab (HR 0.80, p=0.0037). The response rate was
also significantly improved from 37.4% with placebo to 46% with bevacizumab (p=0.0315).
The results from this study taken together with data from other alimentary tract
adenocarcinomas suggest the rationale for further evaluation of VEGF targeting in SBA and
AAC. However, further investigation will require large multicenter efforts in order to provide
the needed comparative data within this disease type.

Author Manuscript

This trial demonstrates the feasibility of completing prospective clinical trials of novel
targeted agents in orphan tumor types. Although our findings suggest a novel combination
therapy for this rare malignancy, they also raise an important question regarding the utility of
costly targeted therapies in a population of patients for whom there are no randomized
clinical trials. Recent successful efforts to target rare subsets of common tumors support the
potential of improved clinical trial enrollment for patients with rare cancers. However, at
present, oncologists and the patients they treat must rely upon phase II clinical trials to guide
treatment decisions.
In conclusion, the combination of CAPOX and bevacizumab is an efficacious and well
tolerated regimen in SBA and AAC. Toxicities were limited and there were no treatment
related deaths. Further exploration of anti-angiogenic approaches in SBA and AAC is
warranted.
