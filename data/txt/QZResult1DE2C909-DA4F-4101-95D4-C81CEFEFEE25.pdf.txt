the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone and signaling regulator
GRP78 in cancer

GRP78, a major endoplasmic reticulum chaperone and signaling regulator, is commonly overexpressed in cancer. Moreover,
induction of GRP78 by a variety of anti-cancer drugs, including histone deacetylase inhibitors, confers chemoresistance to cancer,
thereby contributing to tumorigenesis. Thus, therapies aimed at decreasing GRP78 levels, which results in the inhibition of tumor
cell proliferation and resensitization of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs may hold promise for cancer treatment. Despite
advances in our understanding of GRP78 actions, little is known about endogenous inhibitors controlling its expression. As
endogenous regulators, microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in modulating gene expression; therefore, we sought to identify
miRNA(s) that target GRP78, under the hypothesis that these miRNAs may serve as therapeutic agents. Here, we report that three
miRNAs (miR-30d, miR-181a, miR-199a-5p) predicted to target GRP78 are down-regulated in prostate, colon and bladder tumors,
and human cancer cell lines. We show that in C42B prostate cancer cells, these miRNAs down-regulate GRP78 and induce apoptosis
by directly targeting its 3’ untranslated region. Importantly, we demonstrate that the three miRNAs act cooperatively to decrease
GRP78 levels, suggesting that multiple miRNAs may be required to efﬁciently control the expression of some genes. In addition,
delivery of multiple miRNAs by either transient transfection or lentivirus transduction increased the sensitivity of cancer cells to the
histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A, in C42B, HCT116 and HL-60 cells. Together, our results indicate that the delivery of
co-transcribed miRNAs can efﬁciently suppress GRP78 levels and GRP78-mediated chemoresistance, and suggest that this strategy
holds therapeutic potential.

INTRODUCTION
The glucose regulated protein GRP78, also referred to as BiP or
HSPA5, is a major endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone and a
master regulator of the unfolded protein response (UPR).1–4 GRP78
can also be detected on the surface of cancer cells, where it
mediates oncogenic signals.5 The stress-mediated up-regulation of
GRP78 represents a key adaptive response for cancer cell survival.1
However, under severe stress conditions, apoptosis is triggered
through the induction of BAX/BAK and CHOP.3,6 Tumors are
subjected to ER stress due to intrinsic metabolic alterations and
extrinsic factors in the tumor microenvironment, such as acidosis
and hypoxia, which leads to UPR activation and GRP78 induction.7,8
GRP78 is up-regulated in a variety of tumors, and plays roles in antiapoptosis, tumor progression, angiogenesis and metastasis.1,8–11
Increased GRP78 levels are associated with poor outcome and early
recurrence in prostate cancer.12 Conversely, GRP78 haploinsufﬁciency in mouse cancer models slows the progression of both solid
tumors and hematopoietic malignancies, and inhibits tumor neoangiogenesis.7,13,14 Increased GRP78 expression in cancer cells
facilitates drug resistance by suppressing apoptosis,1,15 whereas
knockdown of GRP78 sensitizes human cancer cells to the histone
deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), malignant gliomas
to temozolomide and tumor-associated endothelial cells to

chemotherapeutic agents.16–18 Collectively, these studies suggest
that GRP78 is a potential therapeutic target in cancer.1,19
Small regulatory RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), endogenously suppress gene expression,20 and hundreds of miRNAs have
been described.21 Human miRNAs regulate several important
biological processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation, development, apoptosis and epigenetic changes,22,23
and are implicated in diseases, such as cancer.24–26 Aberrant
expression of miRNAs is common in various cancers and can be
caused by genomic abnormalities, miRNA processing defects and
epigenetic alterations.27–31 MiRNAs can act as oncogenes or as
tumor suppressors by targeting molecules critically involved in
carcinogenesis24,32,33 and thus, they are good candidate targets
for cancer therapy.27,34 In addition, miRNAs have been implicated
in the stress response.35,36 Since increased GRP78 expression is
involved in tumor progression and chemoresistance, we
hypothesized that miRNAs that target GRP78, which is highly
expressed in cancer, may act as tumor suppressors and may be
clinically relevant. To date, however, the speciﬁc miRNAs involved
in the regulation of GRP78 have yet to be characterized.
Here, we show that miR-30d, miR-181a and miR-199a-5p, three
miRNAs predicted to target GRP78 in silico, are down-regulated in
tumors of various origins and in human cancer cell lines. Further,

we demonstrate an inverse correlation between miRNA and
GRP78 expression levels, suggesting that these miRNAs may
regulate GRP78 and are clinically relevant. Our results indicate that
the three miRNAs directly bind to and down-regulate GRP78 levels
in vitro. In cancer cells, miRNAs showed combinatorial effects on
GRP78 repression, and apoptosis induction as well as on the
reduction of cell survival and colony formation. Importantly, the
cooperation among these miRNAs increased the sensitivity of
cancer cells to drug treatment. Altogether, our results identify
three speciﬁc miRNAs that regulate GPR78 and provide evidence
that the delivery of multiple miRNAs holds promise for the
development of novel cancer therapies.
RESULTS
Inverse relationship between the expression of miR-30d, miR-181a
and miR-199a-5p and their putative target GRP78
In order to identify the speciﬁc miRNAs that target the 30
untranslated region (30 UTR) of GRP78, we used the TargetScan
& 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited

database (http://www.targetscan.org). Of all predicted miRNAs, we
selected three—miR-30d, miR-181a and miR-199a-5p—that have
highly conserved seed sequences at the 30 UTR of GRP78
(Figure 1a; Supplementary Figure S1). We ﬁrst explore whether
the correlation of these three miRNAs and GRP78 could be clinical
relevant by measuring the expression of these three miRNAs and
GRP78 mRNA levels in normal-tumor paired samples from patients
with prostate, colon and bladder cancer. We found an inverse
correlation between miRNAs and GRP78 in all three types of
tumors (Po0.05) (Figure 1b). In order to ﬁnd optimal subjects for
in vitro studies, we next examined the endogenous expression
levels of these miRNAs in non-tumorigenic (LD419, UROtsa and
NK2464) and tumorigenic cell lines (lymphoma, lung, cervical,
bladder, colon and prostate). Differential expression of the three
miRNAs was observed in cell lines (Figure 1c). In general, miR-30d
and miR-181a were down-regulated in most cancer cell lines and
tumor samples, whereas miR-199a-5p maintained low expression
levels in most normal and cancer cell lines, with the exception of
LD419. In contrast, clinical samples showed a clear decrease in

Figure 2. miR-30d, miR-181a and miR-199a-5p directly target the 30 UTR of GRP78 with cooperative effects. (a) The luciferase reporter vector
(pGL3) containing the human GRP78 30 UTR was co-transfected with miR-30d, miR-181a or miR-199a-5p precursors into C42B cells at a final
concentration of 150 nM. Luciferase activity was measured 24 h after transfection and normalized to Renilla (pRL-SV40). (b) Individual miRNAbinding sites (Luc-m1, Luc-m2 and Luc-m3) or all three miRNA-binding sites (Luc-m123) were mutated in the GRP78 30 UTR vector. Luciferase
reporter vectors, either WT or mutant (m1, m2, m3 and m123) were co-transfected with either miRNC or all three miRNA precursors into C42B
cells at a final concentration of 150 nM. Luciferase activity was measured 24 h after transfection and normalized to Renilla (pRL-SV40). Data are
shown as the mean±s.d. of three individual experiments. *Po0.05. miRNC: negative control.

miR-199a-5p expression compared with normal paired controls
(Figure 1b).
Next, we examined the correlation between the expression
levels of miR-30d, miR-181a and miR-199a-5p and GRP78 protein
levels. We selected a panel of two non-tumorigenic cell lines
(LD419 and UROtsa), which have high expression levels of all three
miRNAs (except miR-199a-5p in UROtsa), and four cancer cell lines,
which displayed both high (UM-UC-3, J82) and low (HCT116 and
C42B) miRNA levels. Based on the miRNA expression proﬁle, we
found that GRP78 expression was higher in HCT116 and C42B, and
quite low in other cell lines (Figure 1d), suggesting a regulatory
role of these miRNAs on GRP78 expression.
GRP78 expression is induced in cells following exposure to the
ER stress inducer, thapsigargin (Tg).16,17 To determine how the
endogenous expression levels of these miRNAs affected the cell
response to Tg, we examined GRP78 protein levels 20 h after Tg
treatment. Treatment with Tg caused a fourfold increase in GRP78
protein levels compared with untreated cells. We found that
GRP78 induction was the highest in HCT116 and C42B cells, which
lack the expression of all three miRNAs (Figure 1e). In addition,
GRP78 levels were signiﬁcantly different between cells with upregulated expression of the three miRNAs (LD419, UROtsa, UMUC3
and J82), and cells with low expression of the three miRNAs
(HCT116 and C42B), and these differences persisted even under
conditions known to induce GRP78, such as Tg treatment (Po0.05,
n ¼ 3). Our results also demonstrate a similar pattern of GRP78
expression at the mRNA level (Supplementary Figure S1B).
Collectively, these studies show that both basal and Tg-induced
GRP78 levels inversely associate with the endogenous levels of the
three miRNAs analyzed.
MiR-30d, miR-181a and miR-199a-5p directly target the 30 UTR of
GRP78 and signiﬁcantly suppress luciferase activity cooperatively
To investigate whether GRP78 is a direct target of miR-30d, miR181a and miR-199a-5p, we generated a ﬁreﬂy luciferase reporter
vector containing the GRP78 30 UTR (Figure 2a). The vector was
transfected along with miRNA precursors into C42B cells, since
these cells lack the expression of all three miRNAs. The lysates
were analyzed for luciferase activity 24 h post-transfection. We
Oncogene (2013) 4694 – 4701

found mild repression of luciferase activity by individual miRNAs,
which did not reach statistical signiﬁcance, whereas the transfection with all three miRNAs resulted in approximately a 60%
decrease in activity, suggesting that they act cooperatively
(Po0.05, n ¼ 3) (Figure 2a). However, the combination of any
given two miRNAs may also have a similar effect. To assess this
possibility, we generated mutant GRP78 luciferase constructs,
carrying two base pair changes in each miRNA putative binding
site located at the GRP78 30 UTR (Figure 2b). All three miRNA
precursors were transfected along with wild-type (WT) or mutated
GRP78 vectors into C42B cells to test the binding ability of
different miRNA combinations. Mutation in any of the three
miRNA-binding sequences reduced the ability of all three miRNAs
to inhibit luciferase activity, suggesting that they directly bind to
the 30 UTR of GRP78 and all three are required to achieve efﬁcient
inhibition.
GRP78 down-regulation requires cooperation of multiple miRNAs
and leads to morphological changes and apoptosis in C42B cells
GRP78 is a stable protein present in cancer cell lines and miRNAs
target mRNAs at their 30 UTR region. To further verify the ability of
miR-30d, miR-181a and miR-199a-5p to down-regulate GRP78,
C42B cells were transfected with miRNA precursors and treated
24 h after transfection with Tg to induce GRP78 expression. MiRNA
expression and GRP78 mRNA levels were conﬁrmed by quantitative PCR analysis 20 h post-treatment, an optimal time point for ER
chaperon induction, including GRP78, in C42B cells (data not
shown). As expected, GRP78 mRNA and protein levels signiﬁcantly
increased after Tg treatment in the control samples (miRNC)
(Po0.05, n ¼ 3) (Figures 3a and b). A small, non-signiﬁcant
decrease in GRP78 mRNA levels was found in cells treated with
Tg and transfected with each individual miRNAs, compared with
controls (miRNC). In contrast, when the three miRNAs were
transfected together, we observed a signiﬁcant decrease in GRP78
mRNA levels (Po0.05, n ¼ 3) (Figure 3a), which is consistent with
the ﬁndings of the luciferase experiments described above
(Figure 2a). Similarly, a 50% reduction in GRP78 protein levels
was observed only when the three miRNAs were transfected
together, suggesting again that they act cooperatively (Figure 3b).

Since overexpression of GRP78 in cancer cells can inhibit
apoptosis,1,9,37 we next evaluated whether the modulation of
GRP78 levels by miRNAs affects apoptosis in C42B cells treated with
Tg. In control samples, which show high GRP78 levels, the protein
levels of the apoptotic marker PARP-1, and CHOP, a UPR target that
is induced in response to Tg, were low. In contrast, when GRP78
levels were decreased by transfection of miR-30d, miR-181a and
miR-199a-5p, PARP-1 and CHOP levels were signiﬁcantly upregulated (Po0.05, n ¼ 3) (Figure 3c). In addition, C42B cells
transfected with miRNAs underwent morphological changes and
became rounded. Treatment with Tg resulted in the formation of
small vesicles that resemble apoptotic bodies and a decrease in cell
numbers (Figures 3d and e). We further conﬁrmed the induction of
apoptosis by FACS, using Annexin V and propidium iodide staining.
The results showed a signiﬁcant increase (Po0.05, n ¼ 3) in
apoptosis in cells transfected with all three miRNAs, but not with
miRNC at 24, 48 and 72 h post-transfection. Treatment with Tg
signiﬁcantly increased the apoptotic response in cells transfected
with all three miRNAs, compared with miRNC (38.2%±2.1 vs
12.8%±1.6 at 48 h; 60.8%±1.3 vs 33.9%±2.8 at 72 h) (Po0.05,
& 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited

n ¼ 3) (Figure 3f). Altogether, the results show that a combination of
miRNAs efﬁciently sensitizes C42B cells to apoptosis by reducing
GRP78 levels.
MiR-30d, miR-181a, miR-199a-5p increase the sensitivity of cancer
cells to the HDAC inhibitor TSA
It has been demonstrated that increased GRP78 expression
confers resistance to the HDAC inhibitor TSA, thereby decreasing
its therapeutic efﬁcacy.16 Therefore, we next examined whether
down-regulation of GRP78 by miRNAs in C24B cells modiﬁes their
response to TSA. We found that TSA treatment induced
morphological changes in C24B cells transfected with all three
miRNAs, but not with control (miRNC) (Figure 4a, upper panel).
TSA induced GRP78 protein levels in cells transfected with miRNC,
and this increase was suppressed by transfection of miR-30d,
miR-181a and miR-199a-5p, which also resulted in increased
expression of the apoptotic marker PARP-1 (Figure 4a, lower panel).
As shown above, transfection of all three miRNAs caused a
signiﬁcant decrease in cell numbers (Figure 3e), which can also be

Figure 4. Expression of miR-30d, miR-181a and miR-199a-5p increases TSA sensitivity, and reduces cell viability and colony formation in C42B
cells. C42B cells were transfected with miR-30d, miR-181a and miR-199a-5p precursors and with a negative (miRNC) and positive (siRNA
against GRP78, siGRP78) controls. In all, 24 h post-transfection, C42B cells were treated with vehicle (Ctrl), Tg or the histone deacetylase
inhibitor (TSA). (a) Representative micrographs showing changes in cell morphology. GRP78 and PARP-1 protein levels were assessed by

observed in cells transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA)
against GRP78 (Po0.05, n ¼ 3). TSA treatment of cells transfected
with miRNC caused a signiﬁcant decrease in cell numbers (Po0.05,
n ¼ 3). Importantly, TSA caused further decreases in cell numbers in
cells transfected with the three miRNAs (Po0.05, n ¼ 3) (Figure 4b).
In addition, colony formation assays showed that transfection with
the three miRNAs signiﬁcantly inhibited colony formation in the
presence or absence of TSA, in levels comparable to those of cells
transfected with siGRP78 (Po0.05, n ¼ 3) (Figure 4c). The results
indicate that restoring the expression of multiple miRNAs that target
GRP78 can sensitize cancer cells to therapeutic epigenetic agents.
Lentiviral delivery of multiple co-transcribed miRNAs decreases
GRP78 protein levels and cell viability and induces apoptosis in
different cancer cell lines
In order to improve the delivery efﬁciency of multiple miRNAs and
to evaluate the long-term effects of their expression, we generated
a lentiviral expression vector containing the combination of
miR-30d, miR-181a and miR-199a-5p (Figure 5a), transduced
C42B, HCT116 and HL-60 cells, and conﬁrmed expression of each
miRNA in transduced cells (Supplementary Figure S2A). Transduction of the lentivector carrying multiple miRNAs caused a
signiﬁcant decrease in GRP78 protein levels and cell viability, and
Oncogene (2013) 4694 – 4701

an increase in PARP-1 protein levels in C42B cells treated with Tg
and TSA (Po0.05, n ¼ 3) (Figures 5b–e), as shown in transient
transfections. Tg-treated HCT116 and HL-60 transduced cells
showed a decrease and an increase, but not signiﬁcant in GRP78
and PARP-1 protein levels, respectively, whereas a signiﬁcant
decrease in GRP78 protein levels was observed in TSA-treated
HCT116 cells (Po0.05, n ¼ 3) (Figures 5c and e). Cell viability was
signiﬁcantly reduced in Tg-treated HL-60 cells and in both HCT116
and HL-60 cells treated with TSA (Po0.05, n ¼ 3) (Figure 5d).
Finally, Tg-treated HL-60 and HCT116 cells transduced with three
miRNAs showed no changes in PARP-1 levels, whereas a nonsigniﬁcant increase in PARP-1 was observed in TSA-treated cells
(Figure 5e). In addition, decreased colony formation was observed
in cells transduced with the three miRNAs (Supplementary Figure
S2C). To further conﬁrm the speciﬁcity of the three miRNAs, we
transfected the coding sequence of GRP78 lacking its 30 UTR into
C42B cells stably expressing miR-30d, miR-181a and miR-199a-5p.
Our data showed that, after transfection, GRP78 expression was
restored at both mRNA and protein levels, and that the inhibitory
effects of the three miRNAs on cell survival and colony formation
were abrogated, suggesting that miR-30d, miR-181a and miR-199a5p require the 30 UTR region of GRP78 to exert their actions
(Supplementary Figures S3A–D). Their binding is lost upon
overexpressing GRP78 lacking the 30 UTR sequence, which is

Figure 5. Lentiviral delivery of multiple co-transcribed miRNAs down-regulates GRP78 protein levels, reduces cell viability and induces
apoptosis in different cancer cell lines. (a) Expression vectors were generated by cloning miR-30d, miR-181a and miR-199a-5p into a lentiviral
vector. (b) GRP78 protein levels were determined by western blot in C42B cells infected with lentivirus vectors only (LV) or containing multiple
miRNAs (LV miR-30 þ 181 þ 199). Protein levels were normalized to Actin. (c–e) C42B, HCT116 and HL-60 cells infected with LV or LV miR30 þ 181 þ 199 were treated with Tg, or the histone deacetylase inhibitor (TSA). GRP78 and PARP-1 protein levels were determined by western
blot. Total cell numbers were counted 4 days after the treatment. Data represent mean±s.d. (n ¼ 3). *Po0.05.

consistent with mutation of their binding sites in the luciferase
assay (Figure 2). Taken together, these results indicate that the
cooperative effect of multiple miRNAs that target GRP78 is speciﬁc
and maintained in a stable expression system. The results also
suggest that the magnitude of the overall effect of decreasing
GRP78 levels is cell-type speciﬁc.
MiR-30d, miR-181a and miR-199a-5p inhibit tumor growth in vivo
To investigate the potential anti-tumor activity of these three
miRNAs in vivo, cells stably expressing miR-30d, miR-181a and
miR-199a-5p were cultured in a three-dimensional matrix (transglutaminase-gelatin gel) to mimic the tumor environment and
then injected subcutaneously into athymic nude male mice (n ¼ 6
in each control and experimental group). Tumors were allowed to
grow for 45 days. HCT116 successfully formed tumors, whereas
HCT116 expressing miR-30d, miR-181a and miR-199a-5p showed
tumors that were two- to threefold smaller in size than those of
control cells, suggesting that the three miRNAs inhibit tumorigenesis in vivo (Supplementary Figures S4A and B). In mice injected
with C42B cells, angiogenesis was observed but no tumor
formation was detected. After necropsy, we found that some
cells were still trapped in the gel matrix (data not shown). A
possible explanation for these ﬁndings is that C42B cells may
require longer time for tumor formation when injected subcutaneously.38 C42B cells stably expressing the three miRNAs did
not form tumors. Small nodules, and cells trapped in the gel
matrix were observed in mice injected with HL-60 cells, whereas
no nodules were observed in HL-60 cells stably expressing miR30d, miR-181a and miR-199a-5p (data not shown). Since HL-60
was derived from a liquid tumor, we cannot rule out the possibility
that cell may have migrated to the lymph nodes. Further studies
will help clarify this point.

DISCUSSION
GRP78 up-regulation in various tumor types and its induction after
drug treatment has been shown to be a major contributor to
tumorigenesis and therapeutic resistance.1,39 Despite advances in
our understanding of GRP78 actions and its induction by ER stress,
little is known about endogenous inhibitors controlling its
expression other than repression of its basal expression by
histone deacetylases.16 Thus, discovery of such regulatory
moieties will be important for designing more efﬁcacious
therapeutic approaches. In our study, we identify miR-30d, miR181a and miR-199a-5p as regulatory small RNAs that act
cooperatively to control GRP78 levels. This effect cannot be
attributed to the miRNA dose, since the same amount of total
miRNA was used irrespective of whether they were transfected
alone or in combination. Because the reduction in GRP78 levels
occurs at both mRNA and protein levels, it is likely that the three
miRNAs used in our study act through GRP78 mRNA
destabilization and not translational repression.40 The fact that
miR-30d, miR-181a and miR-199a-5p are down-regulated and
GRP78 is up-regulated in samples of prostate, colon and bladder
cancer patients, suggests that these miRNAs are clinically relevant
and that all three miRNAs are required to suppress GRP78.41 Roue
et al.15 demonstrated that inhibition of GRP78 using siRNA can
overcome drug resistance in mantle cell lymphoma. In our study,
we show that decreased levels of GRP78 achieved by either
transient transfection or transduction of multiple miRNAs can also
increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to TSA treatment, resulting
in the induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of cell growth and
colony formation. Therefore, the use of multiple speciﬁc miRNAs
to target key genes involved in tumorigenesis could provide an
exciting avenue for the development of new cancer therapies. Our
results also suggest that co-expression of multiple miRNAs from a

single lentiviral vector platform42 is an efﬁcient method to deliver
and test the putative combinatorial actions of miRNAs on a single
target gene. Moreover, in vivo data show that the tumor size of the
HCT116 stably expressing miR-30d, miR-181a and miR-199a-5p is
signiﬁcantly smaller than that of control cells, consistent with the
notion that these miRNAs suppress GRP78 expression, leading to
inhibition of tumor growth. However, the effect of the miRNAs on
their targets within the tumor microenvironment requires further
investigation.
The critical role of miRNAs in cancer and their involvement in
common cellular pathways make them valuable and comprehensive targets.27 In addition to targeting GRP78, miR-30d can act
as a negative regulator for p53 and regulate cell-cycle arrest and
apoptosis,43 while down-regulation of miR-199a-5p in human hepatocellular carcinoma is highly associated with cell invasion.44 On the
other hand, it is well established that a single mRNA molecule can
be targeted by multiple miRNAs, and studies focusing on the
combinatorial actions of miRNAs have begun to emerge.45–48 For
instance, multiple miRNAs have been recently shown to regulate
PTEN expression in T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia cells.47 Such
studies indicate that gene expression is tightly controlled by
miRNA networks.49 The results presented here suggest that the
combined action of multiple miRNAs might be essential to achieve
efﬁcient down-regulation of GRP78. If this holds true for other
genes, it may help explain why the validation of the majority of
miRNA targets found using prediction algorithms, which is based
on single miRNA-based experiments, has been unsuccessful.50,51
In conclusion, we report that miR-30d, miR-181a and miR-199a5p regulate GRP78 and that their decreased expression in tumor
cells results in increased GRP78 levels, which in turn promotes
tumorigenesis and therapeutic resistance. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report identifying the speciﬁc miRNAs
that repress GRP78 and their combinatorial regulatory action.
Notably, our results suggest that the use of miRNAs and TSA or
other therapeutic agents in combination therapy may provide a
powerful approach in the treatment of GRP78-overexpressing and
drug-resistant tumors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines, primary tumors and drugs
Normal ﬁbroblast LD419, non-tumorigenic human urothelial UROtsa and
NK2464 cells were obtained and cultured as described previously.52 C42B
cells were a gift from Dr M Stallcup (USC) and were maintained in RPMI
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. UM-UC-3, J82, HCT116, HL-60
cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured according
to the recommended protocols. Patient samples were obtained through
University of Southern California/Norris Tissue Procurement Core Resource
after informed consent and Institutional Review Board approval at the
University of Southern California/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center. Tg
and TSA (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) were prepared as previously
described.16

Reverse transcription and quantitative real-time PCR analysis
MiRNA Taqman assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) were
performed following the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA (15 ng) was
reverse transcribed into miR- and U6-speciﬁc cDNA and miRNA expression
was normalized to U6 snRNA. The mRNA levels were measured by realtime PCR as described.29 Total RNA was extracted by Trizol (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) and cDNA was prepared by M-MLV reversed transcriptase and random hexamers (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The miRNA
expression was normalized to human GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase, one of the most commonly used housekeeping genes).

Western blot assay
The same amount of total cell lysates were prepared for western blot
analysis as described.29 Antibodies against GRP78 (BD Pharmingen, San
Jose, CA, USA); CHOP protein, PARP-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA, USA); b-actin (Sigma) were used.
Oncogene (2013) 4694 – 4701

Transfection
MiRNA precursors (Ambion, Foster City, CA, USA) were transfected into
cells at the ﬁnal concentration of 50 nM using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen)
following the manufacturer’s protocol.

Generation of GRP78 30 UTR luciferase constructs
The human GRP78 30 UTR (387 bp) was cloned into the XbaI site of pGL3control vector (Promega). Mutant vectors were generated using designed
mutagenic oligonucleotide primers by the QuikChange II XL site-directed
mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). Each miRNA-binding site
mutation was carried out by one complete procedure of mutant synthesis.

Luciferase reporter assay
Luciferase reporter vectors, either WT or mutant (500 ng), together with
pRL-SV40 (5 ng) (Promega) were co-transfected with miRNA precursor at
the ﬁnal concentration of 150 nM using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).
Luciferase activity was measured using the Dual Luciferase assay kit
(Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Fireﬂy luciferase
activity was normalized to the internal control Renilla.

Apoptosis assay
Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (Medical & Biological Laboratories,
Woburn, MA, USA) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Brieﬂy, both attached and ﬂoating cells were collected and resuspended in
binding buffer before adding the Annexin V-FITC antibody and propidium
iodide. Stained cells were analyzed by ﬂow cytometry (Beckman Coulter,
Brea, CA, USA).

Cell viability assay and colony formation assay
Cell viability assay and colony formation were described previously.29 Total
cell numbers were counted at the indicated time points. In all, 1000 of cells
were seeded and incubated at 37 1C, 5% CO2 for 14 days to allow colonies
to form. Colonies were ﬁxed in methanol, stained with 10% of Giemsa
solution (Sigma) and counted.

Expression vectors and virus transduction
Expression vectors were made by sequentially cloning each of the
precursor miRNA into pcDNA3.1( þ ) (Invitrogen). MiRNAs were then
cloned into the lentivirus vector using In-Fusion Advantage PCR cloning
kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA). Cells were infected with RNA virus
stock in the presence of polybrene (70 mg/ml). After 24 h, the medium was
substituted with fresh medium containing puromycin (1.25 mg/ml). After 7
days of selection, the puromycin was removed from the medium.

In vivo cell injection with 3D gelatin-TGase
Athymic nude male mice (25–35 g) were used in the study according to an
approved protocol by the Institutional Animal Care and Committee,
University of Southern California. Animals were anesthetized with
ketamine/xylazine (10:1,w/w) before the injection. Gelatin-TGase was
prepared as previously described.53 About 200 ml of gelatin-TGase
cocktail mixed with 106 cells was injected through a 27-gauge needle on
the shank of the mouse. Tumors were allowed to grow for 45 days, after
which time, mice were necropsied and tumor size was measured.
