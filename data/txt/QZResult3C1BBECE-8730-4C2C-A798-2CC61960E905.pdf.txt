ABSTRACT
Although the combination of etoposide (VP16) and cisplatin (DDP) is widely
used as a first-line treatment for advanced-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC),
chemoresistance limits its clinical use. Abnormalities of autophagy are associated
with tumor chemoresistance. The present study found that miR-24-3p, a recently
discovered microRNA, is significantly downregulated in VP16–DDP-resistant SCLC
cells (H446/EP) compared with VP16–DDP-sensitive parent cells (H446). Forced
expression of miR-24-3p sensitized H446/EP cells to VP16–DDP treatment because
of a blockade of autophagic activity. We further found that downregulated miR-243p enhanced autophagy activation as it directly targets and inhibits autophagyassociated gene 4A (ATG4A). Overexpression of miR-24-3p into H446/EP cells led to
reduction of the ATG4A protein level, allowing SCLC cells to resensitize to VP16–DDP.
We conclude that miR-24-3p regulates autophagy by targeting ATG4A. Inhibition of
autophagy by increasing miR-24-3p could be the basis of a strategy to prevent and
treat SCLC with combination chemotherapy, particularly in chemoresistant disease.

INTRODUCTION

such as cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis [6,
7], the role of miRNA in modulating autophagy remains
a promising area of research. Specific miRNAs are
differentially expressed between normal and cancer cells
[8], and modulate cancer therapy response and resistance
[9]. Nevertheless, miRNA expression in chemoresistant
SCLC is not widely investigated, and the mechanisms
that underlie aberrant miRNAs expression are not well
understood.
Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved
intracellular catabolic process by which cells enable
removal of damaged cellular components to improve
energy production under diverse stressful conditions
[10]. This process is characterized by the formation of
autophagosomes—double-membrane vesicles that engulf
portions of cytoplasm and then fuse with lysosomes for
degradation [10]. At least 36 autophagy (ATG) genes are
primarily involved in the autophagy process in mammalian
cells [11]. An indispensable step of autophagosome
formation is the proteolytic cleavage of microtubuleassociated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) to generate

Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) constitutes
approximately 15% of all lung cancers and is one of the
most common malignant tumors worldwide [1, 2]. The
combination of etoposide (VP-16) and cisplatin (DDP)
(VP16–DDP) is the most widely used systemic therapy for
SCLC, especially for advanced-stage disease [3]. SCLC
is characterized by an aggressive propensity for early
dissemination and rapid development of chemoresistance
during the treatment, although patients initially show high
response rates [4]. Patients with resistant disease suffer
early relapse; overall survival at 5 years is less than 5%
[4]. Hence, SCLC chemoresistance is the major obstacle
in clinical application of chemotherapy.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs
that modulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional
level. They bind to 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTR) of
target mRNAs, leading to mRNA destabilization and
translational repression [5]. Although specific miRNA
subsets are linked to various basic cellular processes,

LC3-I isoform with an exposed C-terminal glycine
residue, which enables the conjugation with phophatidylethanolamine to yield LC3-II. Proteolytic cleavage is also
responsible for the deconjugation of LC3-II to LC3-I for
LC3 recycling [12]. These two crucial events are catalyzed
by the cysteine protease ATG4 that acts as both the
conjugating and deconjugating enzyme [13, 14]. To date,
4 Atg4 paralogs (ATG4A, ATG4B, ATG4C and ATG4D)
have been reported in mammals, with substrate spectra
for different LC3 forms and homologs [15]. Autophagic
activity is attenuated in ATG4B- or ATG4C-knockout mice
[16, 17]. However, the role of ATG4A in autophagy and
the dependence of ATG4-mediated autophagy on cancer
cell proliferation remain unclear.
The exact role of autophagy during tumor therapy
is elusive, as autophagy can be a pro-survival mechanism
to deteriorate therapeutic outcomes or act as programmed
cell death to improve overall anti-tumor efficacy [18].
Although understanding of the mechanisms of autophagy
has substantially advanced, information on the regulation
of this complex process is limited. In this study, we
focused on determining the role of miRNAs in the
development of VP16–DDP resistance in SCLC related to
autophagy. Following miRNA array analysis, we screened
dysregulated miRNAs with expression levels that differed
by ≥ 250% either way between VP16–DDP-sensitive
(H446) and VP16–DDP-resistant (H446/EP) SCLC cells.
We found that miR-24-3p, a down-regulated miRNA in
H446/EP cells, had a predominant depressing effect on
autophagy activation, and enhanced the cytotoxicity of
VP16–DDP treatment.
Furthermore, to our knowledge, our study is the
first to confirm ATG4A as a direct functional target of
miR-24-3p in SCLC. Whereas treatment with VP16–
DDP for SCLC promotes autophagy (which facilitates
apoptosis and cell death), overexpressed miR-24-3p
results in downregulated ATG4A and decreases autophagy.
Our results indicate a potential therapeutic target for
reinforcing the efficacy of VP16–DDP chemotherapy.

1B). However, flow cytometry showed minimal change
in apoptosis for H446/EP cells compared with H446 cells
(Fig. 1C).
MicroRNA array results found 8 miRNAs that
were expressed by ≥250% in either H446 or H446/EP
cells compared with the other (Fig. 1D; Supplementary
Table 1). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)
affirmed that 3 miRNAs were downregulated, and 5
were upregulated, in H446 cells, in accordance with the
microarray data (Fig. 1E).

Autophagy reportedly occurs in response to
chemotherapy and plays a major role in development
of chemoresistance in tumor cells [19]. Western blot
analysis showed that in H446 cells, VP16–DDP treatment
led to a dose- and time-dependent increase in the LC3II/LC3-I ratio, and decreased P62 levels, two selective
markers of autophagy (Fig. 2A, B). Autophagy flux
was assessed by detecting levels of LC3-II protein in
the presence or absence of bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1).
As an autophagy-lysosomal inhibitor, Baf A1 promotes
accumulation of autophagic vacuoles by blocking fusion
of autophagosomes with lysosomes, thus preventing LC3II degradation by acidic organelles [20]. We found that
adding Baf A1 further increased LC3-II levels in H446
cells compared with drug therapy alone (Fig. 2B). The
effect of VP16–DDP on autophagy was confirmed by a
GFP-LC3 punctate formation assay; after VP16–DDP
treatment, H446 cells that express GFP-LC3 showed GFPLC3 signals shifting from a diffuse pattern to a punctuate
pattern, which reflects conversion of cytoplasmic LC3-I to
the -associated autophagosome form, LC3-II (Fig. 2C). We
next assessed autophagy activity in VP16–DDP-resistant
cell line H446/EP, which had been established in our lab.
Western blot analysis showed baseline LC3-II levels to be
higher in H446/EP cells than in their H446 parental cells
(Fig. 2D). Elevated autophagy activity in H446/EP was
affirmed by transmission electron microscopy and GFPLC3 fluorescence microscopy, measured as characteristic
autophagosomes formation and an increased percentage of
punctate GFP+ cells, respectively (Fig. 2E, C).
We next explored whether inhibition of autophagy
would enhanced the cellular response to chemotherapy.
Results from the MTT assay showed that the sensitivity of
H446/EP cells to VP16 and DDP was markedly restored
after adding 3-methlyadenine (3-MA) or silencing Atg5 by
small-interfering RNA (siRNA) (Fig. 3A). Both 3-MA and
Atg5 siRNA efficiently attenuated activation of autophagy,
which led to an enhanced apoptosis rate and marked
increases in c-caspase3 and c-PARP, even at low doses
of VP16–DDP (Fig. 3B, C). Collectively, all these data
validated the concept that chemoresistance in SCLC cells

We established VP16–DDP-resistant SCLC cells
(H446/EP) from VP16–DDP-sensitive cells (H446) by
continuous exposure to VP16 and DDP. A MTT assay
measured sensitivity of both cell types to these two
cytotoxic agents. The IC50 values for VP16 were 11.89μg/
ml and 63.27μg/ml in H446 and H446/EP, respectively;
and for DDP were 1.02μg/ml and 6.38μg/ml, respectively
(Fig. 1A). A colony formation assay showed significantly

expression were transfected with miR-24-3p mimics
(PmiR-24-3P) to upregulate miR-24-3P expression. Forced
expression of miR-24-3p led to LC3-I accumulation
coupled with diminished LC3-II levels and prevented
p62 degradation in fed state and more significantly after
VP16–DDP treatment (Fig.4B). As both blockade of
autophagosome formation and excessive autophagosome
degradation can reduce LC3-II levels, Baf A1 was used to
distinguish between these two possibilities. After VP16–
DDP treatment, the LC3-II level was further enhanced
in Baf A1-pretreated control H446/EP cells, whereas
no significant increase was observed in PmiR-24-3p
transfected cells. The effect of miR-24-3p on autophagy
inhibition was identified by GFP-LC3 fluorescence
microscopy, measured as a reduced percentage of punctate
GFP+ H446/EP cells (Fig.4D). We had opposite results
when we silenced miR-24-3p by transfecting a miR24-3p inhibitor (AmiR-24-3P) into H446 cells. LC3-II
expression and punctate GFP+ cells were measured after
AmiR-24-3p treatment, but were minimally altered in the

Mir-24-3p blocked autophagy in SCLC cells
We hypothesized that these dysregulated miRNAs
helped to increase autophagy in H446/EP cells. To verify
the hypothesis, we overexpressed downregulated miRNAs
or inhibited upregulated miRNAs by transfecting H446/
EP cells with miRNA mimics (PmiRNA) or inhibitors
(AmiRNA), whose expression patterns were confirmed
by qRT-PCR (Supplementary Fig.1A, B), and then tested
autophagic activity.Quantitative assessment of LC3-II/
LC3-I and LC3-II/GAPDH ratios served as primary
evidence of autophagy induction.Among the dysexpressed
miRNAs, miR-24-3p overexpression had the strongest
inhibitory effect on autophagy induction, as shown by
decreased LC3-II/LC3-I ratio (Fig. 4A). We thus selected
miR-24-3p to further explore the influence of miRNAs on
autophagy.

presence of Baf A1 compared with negative controls (Fig.
4C, E).
To better evaluate the effects of miR-24-3p on
the autophagic process, a well-established autophagy
inducer, rapamycin (RAP), was applied as a positive
control after separate transfections of AmiR-24-3p and
PmiR-24-3p into H446 and H446/EP cells, respectively.
RAP acts through indirect inhibition of mTORC1, an
autophagy-suppressive regulator, followed by autophagy
stimulation [20]. Both RAP administration and AmiR-243p transfection promoted the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-

II compared with the untreated groups in parental H446
cells (Fig. 4F). Notably, co-treatment of AmiR-24-3p and
RAP led to an additive effect on the LC3-II expression in
H446 cells (Fig. 4F), whereas the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio was
markedly weakened by PmiR-24-3p transfection coupled
with RAP in H446/EP cells (Fig. 4G). These results
indicate that miR-24-3p inhibits autophagy in SCLC cells.

Mir-24-3p suppressed autophagy by directly
targeting ATG4A

in the autophagy gene ATG4A 3′-UTR (Supplementary
Fig. 2A, B). We used a dual-luciferase reporting system
to see whether miR-24-3p affected ATG4A by directly
targeting this specific complementary sequence in its 3′UTR region. Co-transfection of miR-24-3p+ cells with
a wild-type ATG4A 3′-UTR reporter construct greatly

inhibits autophagy, we first searched for autophagy-related
targets of miR-24-3p, using miRNA target prediction
programs. The MirDB and Targetscan bioinformatics
tools helped us find a potential miR-24-3p target sequence

B; Supplementary Fig. 3). Consistent with the results,
ATG4A mRNA and protein expression were increased in
H446/EP cells (Fig. 5C). We next checked ATG4A levels
in both H446 and H446/EP cells after regulating miR-243p expression. PmiR-24-3p led to attenuation of ATG4A
mRNA and protein levels in H446/EP cells, but AmiR24-3p showed the opposite effect on ATG4A expression
in H446 cells (Fig. 5D; Supplementary Fig. 1D). Similar
to the phenotype induced by miR-24-3p overexpression,
ATG4A knockdown limited both LC3 lipidation and P62
degradation in H446/EP cells, indicating inhibition of
autophagy (Fig. 5E).
To further confirm that miR-24-3p modulates
autophagy by directly repressing ATG4A, we conducted
rescue experiments through ATG4A overexpression.
Autophagy blockage induced by PmiR-24-3p returned to
control levels after co-transfection of H446/EP cells with
cDNA that expressed ATG4A (Fig. 5F, G).
To test whether the effect of miR-24-3p on
autophagy was cell type-specific, we performed similar
analyses in another SCLC cell line, LTEP-sm. ATG4A
expression in LTEP-sm cells was slightly lower than in
H446 cells (Fig.5C), and miR-24-3p expression was
mildly higher(Supplementary Fig. 1C). Consistent
with our results in H446 cells, both ATG4A mRNA
and protein levels greatly increased in LTEP-sm cells
transfected with AmiR-24-3P, but not in cells transfected
with control plasmid (Fig.5D; Supplementary Fig. 1D).
Administering miR-24-3p led to conversion of LC3-I to
LC3-I I, which was reversed by adding a specific siRNA
that targets ATG4A (Supplementary Fig. 4). These results
demonstrated that miR-24-3p directly targeted ATG4A to
repressively mediate autophagy induction.

and colony formation ability induced by supplementary
miR-24-3p was abrogated by ATG4A overexpression (Fig.
6A, B). Furthermore, the sensitivity of H446 and LTEPsm cells toVP16, DDP or paclitaxel was greatly reduced
when any of the drugs were combined with AmiR-24-3p.
Nevertheless, suppression of ATG4A restored the cytotoxic
effect of AmiR-24-3p in response to chemotherapeutics
(Fig. 6C; Supplementary Fig.5A). Similarly, miR-243p downregulation promoted colony-formation of these
cells under drug treatment, but was reversed by ATG4A
knockdown (Fig. 6D; Supplementary Fig. 5B).

DISCUSSION
As far as we know, the present study is the first
to report that miR-24-3p suppresses the endogenous
autophagy process by directly downregulating ATG4A
expression in SCLC cells. Inhibition of autophagy by
induced overexpression of miR-24-3p helps resensitize
SCLC cells to VP16–DDP combined therapy.
Autophagy is a conserved pro-survival response to
chemotherapy to maintain cellular homeostasis, which in
turn conduces chemoresistance development in several
cancer types [21–23]. Currently, inhibitors of autophagy
that sensitize chemoresistant cells to anti-cancer therapy
are being investigated in clinical trials [24]. Modulation
of autophagy by miRNAs is a quite novel and potentially
effective strategy to resensitize cancer cells. Although
several miRNAs have so far been reported to regulate
autophagic process by targeting autophagy-related genes
in diverse cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma,
leukemia and breast cancer [25–27], few investigations
verified miRNAs to directly affect regulation of autophagy
in SCLC cells. In this study, we were interested in the
role of miRNA in modulating chemoresistance of SCLC
cells through autophagy activity. We first confirmed that
VP16–DDP-resistant H446 cells showed higher basal
level of autophagy than did their parental H446 cells;
and then, using microarray analysis, we identified a set
of specific differentially expressed miRNAs associated
with VP16–DDP resistance. Some of these differential
expressed miRNAs are reported to closely correlate with
tumor behavior. For example, miR-27a-3p and miR-243p synergistically promoted glioma cells proliferation by
directly targeting MXL1 [28], whereas overexpression
of miR-4430 is related to distant metastasis in salivary
adenoid cystic carcinoma cells[29].
However, in our study, of all these dysregulated
miRNAs, only induced expression of miR-24-3p into
H446/EP cells blockaded autophagy activity and reduced
cell viability with VP16–DDP treatment. Overexpression
of miR-24-3p attenuated GFP-LC3 dot formation,
conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and P62 degradation. These
results still held true even after using an autophagy inducer
(rapamycin). In contrast, silence of endogenous miR-243p activated the autophagy response in H446 cells, which

Forced miR-24-3p expression resensitized SCLC
cells to chemotherapy by blocking autophagy
We next verified that miR-24-3p inhibited SCLC
cell proliferation and survival in response to VP16–DDP
by attenuating the protective effect of autophagy through
suppressing ATG4A. Either restoration of miR-24-3p
or silencing ATG4A effectively increased cytotoxicity
and decreased proliferation in H446/EP cells, as shown
by MTT and colony formation assays, respectively
(Fig. 6A, B). By contrast, introduction of exogenous
ATG4A promoted drug resistance in H446/EP cells that
overexpressed miR-24-3p. Moreover, similar results were
obtained in H446/EP cells transfected with PmiR-24-3p
or siATG4A following treatment with another cytotoxic
agent, paclitaxel. C-caspase-3 and c-PARP expression
were simultaneously enhanced by VP16–DDP treatment,
in both miR-24-3p-overexpressing and ATG4A-silenced
H446/EP cells, which implies a restored sensitivity to
apoptosis (Fig. 7A, B), which was confirmed by flow
cytometry (Fig. 7C, D). However, reduced cell viability

treatment. Collectively, these data indicate the importance
of miR-24-3p in autophagy regulation.
Bioinformatics predictions and a luciferase reporter
assay identified the autophagy-related gene ATG4A as a
direct functional target of miR-24-3p, and further found
ATG4A to downregulate in H446/EP cells with miR-243p overexpression. Of four mammalian ATG4 family
members, ATG4B reportedly shows the most active
and broadest proteolysis on human ATG8 orthologs,
followed by ATG4A, and other family members [15].
However, tissue- or cell-specific roles for ATG4 might
vary in mammalian systems and complicate interpretation
of their individual functions. ATG4C-knockout mice
exhibited decreased autophagic activity upon starvation,
but had weak autophagy defect under normal conditions
[17]. ATG4C was also regarded as a direct target of miR376b in human hepatocarcinoma cell lines, in which it
promotes LC3 maturation [30]. Another counter-example
can be seen in the mammosphere formation in breast
cancer cells. Overexpression of ATG4A, but not ATG4B,
in mammospheres reportedly contributes to breast
cancer stem cell maintenance, owing to its importance in
autophagosomal maturation [31]. During early erythroid
differentiation (when autophagy was activated) expression
of ATG4A and ATG4D was markedly increased, whereas
ATG4B showed minimal change [32]. These results show
the potential role of ATG4A in an efficient autophagic
process.
In our study, we detected no prominent increase of
the lipidated LC3-II form after miR-24-3p upregulation
and ATG4A silence, but did observe accumulation of the
nonlipidated LC3-I form accompanied by an enhanced
expression of p62 protein, which suggests interruption of
LC3 maturation at the lipidation stage. This is consistent
with the early idea that ATG4B rather than ATG4A is
responsible for LC3 protein delipidation [33]. MiR-243p overexpression led to dramatic decreases in ATG4A
mRNA and protein levels, but reintroduction of ATG4A
in the presence of miR-24-3p reversed autophagy
suppression. The effect of miR-24-3p on ATG4A occurred
directly through its 3′UTR region, and introduction
of mutations to this sequence efficiently abolished the
miRNA’s effect. In addition, we attempted to investigate
whether miR-24-3p could modulate the expression of
other ATG4 proteins. Unfortunately, we observed no
obvious difference on the baseline levels of these ATG4
proteins (Supplementary Fig.6A). All three of ATG4
mRNA and protein expression were minimally altered
after either transfection of AmiR-24-3p into H446 and
LTEP-sm cells or transfection of PmiR-24-3p into H446/
EP cells (Supplementary Fig.6B, C).
Gene amplification and overexpression of miR24 are reported in several cancer types, including oral
squamous cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and
glioma; and correlate with tumorigenesis, progression,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and aggressiveness [34–36]. Moreover, miR-24 has been
associated with key regulation of many genes involved
in apoptosis induction. MiR-24-3p overexpression
helps reverse resistance to apoptosis by downregulating
expression of two apoptosis blockers, X-linked
inhibitor of apoptosis protein and lysophosphatidic
acid acyltransferase-β [37, 38]. To our knowledge,
however, the role of miR-24-3p in regulating autophagy
remained undefined. Our study of the contribution of
autophagy-related effects of miR-24-3p could provide
valuable information about the role of this miRNA under
physiological conditions.
Strikingly, both miR-24-3p overexpression and
ATG4A knockdown greatly reduced cell viability, inhibited
cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis; these effects
were even more pronounced when VP16−DDP-resistant
cells were treated with VP16–DDP or paclitaxel alone.
However, these results could be reversed after restoring
ATG4 expression. Our findings strongly indicate that
autophagy inhibition through miR-24-3p-mediated
targeting of ATG4A in SCLC cells cuts the cells’ survival
response and enhances chemotherapy cytotoxicity (Fig.
8). Further in vivo studies could uncover beneficial
effects of autophagy suppression by miR-24-3p. In fact,
autophagy inhibition combined with cancer therapy has
been proposed as an approach to potentiate tumor cell
death. Some dysexpressed miRNAs have been shown to
affect sensitivity to radio-or chemotherapy by regulating
autophagy in several types of cancer cells [25–27].
However, the details of mechanisms and intracellular
signaling pathways through which miRNAs exert
their function, especially on autophagy regulation, are
unclear. Further intensive research is needed to elucidate
relationships between aberrant miRNA expression and
autophagy abnormalities to develop use of miRNAs into a
tool of improved cancer therapy [39].
In summary, we report here, for the first time, that
miR-24-3p is a novel regulator of autophagy in SCLC
cells. MiR-24-3p mediated autophagy regulation by
targeting ATG4A and thereby contributed to VP16–DDP
resistance. Inhibition of autophagy by elevation of miR24-3p might provide a useful strategy for combatting
chemoresistance in SCLC cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and reagents
Human small-cell lung carcinoma H446 and LTEPsm cells were purchased from the Tumor Cell Bank of
the Chinese Academy of Medical Science (Shanghai,
China) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing
10% fetal bovine serum and ampicillin and streptomycin
at 37ºC in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5%

Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis

CO2. VP16–DDP-resistant H446 cells (H446/EP) were
established and preserved in a final concentration of 1.5μg/
ml VP16 and concentration of 1.25μg/ml DDP. Antibodies
against LC3, P62, caspase-3, activated (cleaved) caspase-3
(c-caspase-3), PARP, cleaved PARP (c-PARP), Atg5 and
GAPDH came from Cell Signaling Technology, (MA,
USA). Anti-ATG4A, Anti-ATG4B, Anti-ATG4C and AntiATG4D antibodies came from Abcam. Bafilomycin A1
and 3-methyladenine (3-MA) came from Sigma Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO).

Total RNAs were extracted from cells with Trizol
(Invitrogen) Reagent following the manufacturer’s
protocol. For miRNA detection, SYBR PrimeScript™
miRNA RT-PCR kit (Takara, Japan, Cat. No. RR716)
was used according to manufacturer’s instructions. The
conditions for PCR reactions were: 95°Cfor 30 s followed
by 40 cycles of 95°C for 5 s and 60°C for 30 s, using a
StepOnePlus™ thermal cycler. MiRNA expression levels
were normalized to U6 RNA. SYBR Premix Ex TaqTM
(Takara, Japan, Cat. No. RR420A) was also used to detect
mRNA. SYBR Green quantitative PCR amplifications
were performed on a StepOnePlus™ thermal cycler, in
25μl volumes containing 12.5μl of 2×SYBR Green PCR
Master Mix. The thermal profile for real-time PCR was:
95°C for 30 s; followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 5 s, 60°C
for 30 s and 70°C for 30 s. Relative mRNA expression
was normalized to GAPDH using the comparative △△CT
method; values are expressed as 2−△△CT. Primer sequences
are listed in Supplementary Table 2.

cDNA constructs, siRNA and transfection
The GFP-tagged LC3 cDNA expression construct
was a gift from Dr. Noboru Mizushima (Tokyo Medical
and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan). Both miR-243p inhibitor (AmiR-24-3p) and miR-24-3p precursor
(PmiR-24-3p) were provided by Applied Biosystem (Life
Technologies). ATG5 siRNA, ATG4A siRNA, pDsRed1/
Atg4A were purchased from GenePharma (Shanghai,
China). Cells were transfected by using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen, USA), according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.

Apoptosis assay

Cell viability

We measured apoptosis using an Annexin-Vfluorescein isothiocyanate apoptosis detection kit
(Oncogene Research Products, Boston, MA) that
quantitatively measures percentages of early apoptotic
cells via flow cytometry. Western blot analyses for
c-PARP and c-caspase3 after various treatments were also
performed.

Cells were seeded into 96-well plates (3×103 cells/
well) directly or 24 h after transfection. After treatment
with indicated drug combinations for 48 h, cell viability
was assessed via 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyl-trtrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as described
previously [40].

Dual luciferase reporter assay

Colony formation assay

The 3′-UTR-fragments of ATG4A containing
miR-24-3p targeting sequence were cloned into the
psiCHECKTM-2 dual luciferase reporter plasmid at the 3′
end of the of R. reniformis luciferase coding sequence. For
the reporter assay, cells were cultured to approximately
80% confluence in a 6-well plate, and then co-transfected
with either psiCHECKTM2-WT-ATG4A-3′UTR (wild
type) or psiCHECKTM2-MT-ATG4A-3′UTR (mutant)
vector and control miRNA (PmiR-NC) or miR-24-3p
mimic (PmiR-24-3p). At 48 h after transfection, firefly and
Renilla luciferase activities were measured and normalized
using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay.

After 48h transfection, cells were exposed to various
treatments, and then seed into 6-well plates. Cells were
allowed to adhere and grow for between 10 to 14 d. To
visualize colonies, cells were fixed with methanol and
stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Colonies with ≥50 cells
were manually counted under a dissection microscope.

Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer; protein
concentrations were determined with a BCA kit (Pierce,
Rockford, IL, USA). Equal amount of cell lysates were
subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose
members, and analyzed as described previously [41].

GFP-LC3 analysis
Twenty-four hours after GFP-LC3 transfection, cells
were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min, washed with
PBS, mounted in glycerol in PBS and inspected using a
fluorescence microscope. Both H446 and H446/EP cells

with ≥10 GFP-LC3 dots were considered positive. The
number of cells with punctate fluorescence was counted
in 10 different fields under a fluorescent microscope. At
least 150 GFP+ cells per condition were analyzed; results
were expressed as percentages of GFP-LC3 dot+ cells vs.
total number of GFP+ cells.
