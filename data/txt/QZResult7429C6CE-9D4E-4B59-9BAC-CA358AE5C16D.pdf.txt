Abstract
Neuroblastoma (NB) is an often fatal pediatric tumor of neural crest origin. We previously isolated NB tumorinitiating cells (NB TIC) from bone marrow metastases that resemble cancer stem cells and form metastatic NB
in immunodeficient animals with as few as ten cells. To identify signaling pathways important for the survival
and self-renewal of NB TICs and potential therapeutic targets, we screened a small molecule library of 143
protein kinase inhibitors, including 33 in clinical trials. Cytostatic or cytotoxic drugs were identified that targeted
PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/Akt, PKC (protein kinase C), Aurora, ErbB2, Trk, and Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1).
Treatment with PLK1 siRNA or low nanomolar concentrations of BI 2536 or BI 6727, PLK1 inhibitors in clinical
trials for adult malignancies, were cytotoxic to TICs whereas only micromolar concentrations of the inhibitors
were cytotoxic for normal pediatric neural stem cells. Furthermore, BI 2536 significantly inhibited TIC tumor
growth in a therapeutic xenograft model, both as a single agent and in combination with irinotecan, an active
agent for relapsed NB. Our findings identify candidate kinases that regulate TIC growth and survival and suggest
that PLK1 inhibitors are an attractive candidate therapy for metastatic NB. Cancer Res; 71(4); 1385–95. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common and deadly
extracranial solid tumor in children (1, 2). It is an embryonal
malignancy thought to arise from the primitive sympathetic
neural precursors that normally differentiate to form the
sympathetic nervous system. Up to 60% of patients present
with widely metastatic disease at diagnosis, typically characterized by bone and bone marrow metastases. Despite
intensive treatment regimens, comprising surgery, chemotherapy, and irradiation, high-risk NB patients with relapse
in the bone marrow have a long-term survival rate of less than
10% (1, 2). In addition, patients who respond to chemotherapy
are at risk for developing long-term complications such as
hearing loss, cardiac dysfunction, and infertility. Thus, a

search for novel, more potent, and less toxic treatments of
NB is warranted.
A growing body of evidence supports the notion that
"cancer stem cells" or "tumor-initiating cells" (TIC) are present
in multiple malignancies and are responsible for sustaining
tumor growth, progression, relapse, and metastases (3–5).
Therefore, targeting TICs, particularly from patients with
relapsed NB, is an attractive and novel therapeutic approach.
We recently identified TICs from NB bone marrow metastases
that have several properties of cancer stem cells, including the
expression of stem cell markers, the ability to self-renew, and
the capability to form metastatic NB in immunodeficient
animals with as few as 10 cells (6). These cells, propagated
as spheres in serum-free neural stem cell media, are ideal for
identifying NB TIC–selective signaling pathways and potential
NB therapeutic agents because of their greatly enhanced
tumorigenic potential as compared with adherent cell lines
established in serum-containing media (6, 7). However, little is
known about the signaling pathways required for NB TIC
survival and self-renewal from the metastatic bone marrow
niche.
To identify NB TIC pathways and novel therapeutic targets
for clinical use, we performed a drug screen on bone marrow–
derived TICs with a unique collection of pharmacologic kinase
inhibitors. We show that Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is required
for NB TIC survival in vitro. Furthermore, BI 2536, a PLK1
inhibitor currently in clinical trials for adult cancers, significantly inhibits tumor growth in a xenograft model, both as a
single agent and in combination with the NB drug irinotecan
and is therefore a promising candidate for NB treatment.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
NB TICs (NB12, NB88R2, and NB122R) and skin-derived
precursor cells (SKP; FS90, FS105, FS107, FS274, FS276, FS280,
and FS298) isolated from postnatal foreskin were cultured as
previously described (6–9). SMS-KCNR, obtained from Carol
Thiele (NIH), and SK-N-AS cells from American Type Culture
Collection were cultured as spheres in serum-free neural stem
cell media.
Kinase library
A kinase inhibitor library consisting of 143 drugs active
against at least 48 individual kinases as primary targets was
compiled by the Medicinal Chemistry Platform at the
Ontario Institute for Cancer Research (OICR; Supplementary
Table 1). The compounds were purchased from a number of
vendors: Alexis, Axon Medchem BV, Cayman Chemical,
Chemietek, LC Laboratories, Sigma Aldrich and Tocris
Bioscience. BI 2536 for in vitro and in vivo follow-up studies
was purchased from Selleck Chemicals. BI 6727 was synthesized according to the procedures provided in the patent
literature (WO2007030361).
Primary screening assay
Screening was performed at the SMART Facility of the
Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, as previously described
(10). TICs were dissociated into single cells and seeded at 3,000
cells per well in 100 mL medium in 96-well microplates.
Compounds were dissolved in DMSO, re-aliquoted in daughter
plates as 1 and 0.2 mmol/L solutions, and added using a pin
tool to achieve final concentrations of 1 or 0.2 mmol/L. Drug
effects were compared with cells optimally proliferating in
0.1% DMSO alone, whereas wells filled with media served as
the background. alamarBlue (10 mL) was added after 72 hours,
and fluorescence intensity was measured after 24 hours on a
PHERAstar microplate reader, equipped with a l540 excitation/l590 emission filter.
Assay quality, hits selection, and validation
The dimensionless parameters Z0 - and Z-factors were
used to assess robustness and consistency of the assay. Hits
were defined as compounds that caused a signal decrease of
at least 45% as compared with controls. Confirmatory tests
were performed using 8-point, 3-fold serial dilutions of
compounds. Cells were seeded, treated with serially diluted
compounds, and tested for alamarBlue reduction as previously.
Sphere formation assay
NB TICs and SKPs from several patients were seeded in
triplicate in untreated 96-well microplates at a density of 3,000
cells per well in 50 mL per well, containing 30% SKP conditioned media (10). Compounds were diluted in medium
(1:1,000) and immediately added to the cells in a volume of
50 mL (final concentration of DMSO ¼ 0.05%). Cells were
retreated 72 hours postplating with drugs and fixed after
6 days with 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy

Sciences). Sphere number was determined by manual counting, and the results were expressed as the mean sphere
number of treated wells as compared with DMSO-treated
wells  100. EC50 curves were generated using GraphPad
Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.).
RNA interference
TICs (NB88R2) were transfected with 500 nmol/L of either
scrambled siRNA or a PLK1 siRNA pool (Dharmacon Accell;
ThermoFisher) by nucleofection (Microporator). Transfection
conditions were as follows: voltage, 1,350V; pulse width, 20
mm; pulse number, 2. Following transfection, cells were
seeded in triplicate wells at a density of 1  105 per well in
24-well dishes (1 mL medium per well). On specific time points
(i.e., 24, 48, and 72 hours), spheres were collected, dissociated,
stained with trypan blue, and visually inspected to assess
viability by the trypan blue exclusion method.
Western blot analysis
For cell lysis, cells were collected and washed in cold PBS
and lysates were prepared in NP-40 lysis buffer. Equal amounts
of protein were resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gels and
subjected to immunoblotting with the following antibodies:
mouse anti-PLK1 (1:1,000; Invitrogen), rabbit anti-cleaved
PARP (1:1,000; Cell Signaling), mouse anti-cyclin B1 (1:1;000;
Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-p21 (1:1;000; Cell Signaling), rabbit
anti-ERK1 (1:10,000; Santa Cruz), and mouse anti-GAPDH
(1:10,000; Ambion). Horseradish peroxidase–conjugated goat
anti-mouse IgG (1:5,000) and goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000)
were used as the secondary antibodies.
Viable cell counts following treatment with BI 2536
A total of 1  105 dissociated NB TICs (NB88R2) were
seeded in triplicate in 24-well non–tissue culture-treated
plates in 1 mL of medium. BI 2536 (10–100 nmol/L) or DMSO
was immediately added to the cells. At specific time points,
spheres were collected, dissociated, and subjected to a viable
cell count by trypan blue exclusion.
Annexin V assay
The ability of BI 2536 to induce apoptosis in NB TICs was
determined with an Annexin V-FITC detection kit, used
according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Pharmingen). Briefly, 1  106 NB TICs (NB88R2) were plated in 12-well
dishes and cultured with various concentrations of BI 2536 (1–
100 nmol/L). At various time points (16–40 hours), cells were
harvested, stained for Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI), and
analyzed on an LSR II flow cytometer. Relative numbers of
Annexin V–positive, PI-negative cells were obtained for each
time point.
Determination of cellular DNA content
NB TICs (1  106) were plated in 12-well dishes and cultured
in the presence of either DMSO or BI 2536 (10 and 100 nmol/
L). After 16 hours, cells were harvested, washed in PBS, and
fixed in 70% ethanol. Fixed cells were treated with RNAse A,
stained with PI at 37 C for 1 hour, and analyzed on an LSR II
flow cytometer to determine cellular DNA content.

PLK1 Regulates Neuroblastoma Survival

In vitro PLK1 kinase assay
The assay was performed as previously described (11).
Briefly, NB TICs (NB88R2) were dissociated into single
cells and treated in the presence of 0.1% DMSO or 100
nmol/L BI 2536 for 3 hours. Cells were then solubilized in
NP-40 lysis buffer, and lysates normalized for protein
content were incubated with PLK1 monoclonal antibody
(Millipore). Immune complexes were recovered with protein A-Sepharose beads and incubated with 5 mCi
[g-32P]ATP at 30 C for 20 minutes and 10 mg of dephosphorylated a-casein (Sigma) in 30 mL of PLK1 kinase
buffer (20 mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mmol/L KCl, 10
mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L DTT, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/
L ATP). The reactions were stopped by adding 20 mL of
Laemmli buffer. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE,
and gels were visualized by autoradiography.
Xenograft models
TICs (NB88R2; 3  105) were resuspended in PBS,
mixed 1:3 with Matrigel (Trevigen), and injected in 30mL volume into the dermis of 4- to 5-week-old NOD/SCID
(nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient)
mice. Drug treatment began when tumor size reached
approximately 50 to 100 mm3. Mice were injected intravenously on 2 consecutive days each week with either BI
2536 (12.5 or 25 mg/kg) or vehicle (0.1N HCl per saline)
for a total of 2 to 3 cycles. In the combination study,
mice were treated with vehicle (0.1N HCl per saline), 12.5
mg/kg of BI 2536, and/or 10 mg/kg of irinotecan as
described in the figure legend.
Assessment of bone marrow toxicity in a xenograft
model following treatment with BI 2536
TICs (NB88R2; 3  105) were resuspended in PBS, mixed 1:3
with Matrigel (Trevigen), and injected in 30-mL volume into
the dermis of 4- to 5-week-old NOD/SCID mice. Drug treatment began when tumor size reached approximately 50 to 100
mm3. Mice were injected intravenously on 2 consecutive days
each week with either BI 2536 (n ¼ 10; 25 mg/kg) or vehicle (n
¼ 10; 0.1N HCl per saline) for a total of 2 cycles. Blood samples
were collected 24 hours after the last drug dose and analyzed
via Hemavet Hematology Analyzer (950FS) to access the
differences in red blood cell/white blood cell counts.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with Microsoft Excel,
using an unpaired, 2-tailed Student's t test, with P < 0.05 as the
significance cutoff. One-way ANOVA was used to determine
statistically significant differences from the mean in the
combination study in vivo.

Results
Small molecule kinase inhibitor screen identifies
compounds that target NB TICs
To identify signaling pathways required for NB TIC survival
and proliferation, we screened low-passage TIC lines from
bone marrow metastases from 3 high-risk NB patients (NB12,

www.aacrjournals.org

NB88R2, and NB122R) with a collection of 143 kinase inhibitors (Fig. 1A). Positive hits were defined as compounds
exhibiting more than 45% growth inhibition at 1 mmol/L in
at least 1 NB TIC line. To validate the data from the primary
screen, we retested the hit compounds using 8-point serial
dilutions for each inhibitor and determined from these data
EC50 values (Fig. 1B). More than 85% of the primary hits were
confirmed (23/27), showing excellent assay quality. Interestingly, all of the hit compounds were found to target all 3 NB
TIC lines, albeit with different potencies (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, 15 confirmed compounds inhibited NB TIC growth with
nanomolar potency (Fig. 1B, marked in green; EC50 < 1 mmol/
L). The identified hit compounds were grouped into clusters
on the basis of their reported primary kinase target. For
several targets, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/
Akt, protein kinase C (PKC), PLK1, Aurora kinase, ErbB2, and
Trk, at least 2 compounds per target were found to exhibit
cytotoxicity toward NB TICs (Fig. 1B).
Secondary screen identifies PLK1 as a promising NB
target
To further define the most potent and selective compounds, a secondary screen was conducted in which NB
TICs were tested in parallel with normal human pediatric
SKPs, which are neural crest-like stem cells (8, 9). Similarly
to NB TICs, SKPs self-renew in vitro, express neural crest
progenitor markers such as nestin, and can be differentiated
into neural crest lineages but are nontumorigenic. We thus
used SKPs as an accessible nontransformed counterpart of
NB TICs, suitable for testing potential toxicity of various
drugs (10).
A total of 15 hit compounds with nanomolar potency were
chosen for secondary screening. As summarized in Table 1, 9
of 15 compounds showed a modest selectivity profile (<10fold difference in EC50 values). However, 6 compounds
showed considerable selectivity, resulting in 10-fold to
greater than 1,000-fold difference in EC50 values (Table 1;
highlighted in bold). Of the 6 compounds, PLK1 inhibitors
were chosen for further analysis, as PLK1 inhibitors,
GW843682X and BI 2536, showed excellent potency as well
as more than 10-fold selectivity toward NB TICs than for
SKPs (Fig. 2A and B). Both PLK1 inhibitors suppressed NB
TIC self-renewal in the nanomolar range (EC50 ¼ 470 and 6.7
nmol/L, respectively), whereas SKP self-renewal capacity
was affected only at micromolar concentrations (EC50 ¼
3.6 and 5.2 mmol/L, respectively), indicating a favorable
selectivity profile and a wide therapeutic window (Table 1
and Fig. 2A and B). BI 2536, however, exhibited only micromolar cytotoxicity toward SK-N-AS (EC50 ¼ 3 mM; data not
shown), a bone marrow–derived NB cell line that was
established in adherent and serum-containing conditions
and that we adapted to spheroid and serum-free culture. BI
2536, an ATP-competitive inhibitor that shows 10,000-fold or
greater selectivity for PLK1 relative to 63 other kinases and is
currently in phase II clinical trials for adult malignancies (12,
13), was of particular interest because of its specificity for
PLK1 and as a potential drug that could be used for NB. A
third PLK1 inhibitor, BI 6727, which exhibits an improved

NOTE: For each compound, EC50 is calculated for both NB TICs and SKPs from testing multiple lines at least 2 to 3 times. Compounds

lines established in serum-containing media conditions and
was virtually absent in SKPs (Fig. 2C). This observation is
consistent with the notion that PLK1 is selectively overexpressed in tumor cells (15) and provides an explanation for the
enhanced sensitivity of NB cells as compared with nontransformed SKPs.
We next confirmed the requirement of PLK1 for NB TIC
survival by a transient siRNA knockdown approach. Suppression
of PLK1 expression resulted in a 7- to 10-fold reduction in viable
cell numbers as compared with cells treated with scrambled
siRNA (Fig. 2D). The efficacy of the PLK1 siRNA was confirmed
by immunoblotting with anti-PLK1 (Fig. 2D). These results
indicate that PLK1 is required for NB TIC survival.
BI 2536 treatment induces cell-cycle arrest and
aberrant accumulation of cyclin B1 and p21
We next asked whether BI 2536 targets proteins or pathways in NB TICs that are known to be modulated by PLK1.
We hypothesized that BI 2536 acts through cell-cycle disruption, as has been previously reported in various tumor
cell lines (11, 13). Following incubation with BI 2536, the
percentage of NB TICs in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle
significantly increased, in addition to the emergence of a
peak, indicative of cells with 8n DNA content (Fig. 3A).
Cyclin B1, which is required for cell-cycle progression and
is a known downstream PLK1 substrate (11, 16), aberrantly
accumulated following incubation with BI 2536 (Fig. 3B and
C), indicating that this drug acts in NB TICs in a manner
similar to that in other tumor cells. Furthermore, the cyclindependent kinase inhibitor p21, a newly identified substrate
of PLK1, (16, 17), also accumulated in BI 2536–treated NB

TICs (Fig. 3C). Finally, PLK1 kinase activity was inhibited
following treatment of NB TICs with BI 2536, as demonstrated by anti-PLK1 immunoprecipitiation followed by
in vitro PLK1 kinase assay (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these
results suggest that cyclin B1 and p21 are targets of PLK1 in
NB TICs and that BI 2536 inhibits PLK1 activity and PLK1
downstream effector proteins.
BI 2536 treatment induces cell death via apoptosis
We next asked whether BI 2536, like PLK1 siRNA, induces
apoptosis in NB TICs. To assess this, NB TICs were treated
with varying concentrations of BI 2536 and viable cells were
counted at 24, 48, and 72 hours posttreatment (Fig. 4A). We
observed a significant difference in viable cell numbers in BI
2536–treated samples, as compared with DMSO (vehicle)treated cells, at 24 hours posttreatment. The difference
became more pronounced with time, such that at 72 hours
there were only approximately 20% viable cells following
treatment with 10 nmol/L BI 2536 and approximately 2%
to 5% viable cells following treatment with 30 and 100 nmol/L
as compared with DMSO-treated cells.
To determine whether the cell death following BI 2536
treatment was due to apoptosis, NB TICs were lysed at
different time points posttreatment and the presence of
cleaved PARP, a marker associated with apoptosis, was
examined. At 24 hours, BI 2536–treated cells gradually
accumulated cleaved PARP, in contrast to DMSO-treated
cells, suggesting induction of apoptosis (Fig. 4B). To confirm the induction of apoptosis by BI 2536, we evaluated
Annexin V expression on the surface of drug-treated cells
by flow cytometry. Representative data are shown in

of early apoptotic cells, were present at low levels in
cells treated with DMSO or 1 nmol/L BI 2536. This cell
population, however, became more prominent at 16 hours
posttreatment with 10 or 100 nmol/L BI 2536, reached a

peak at 30 hours, and persisted until 40 hours. The quantification of the data is presented in Figure 4D. Taken
together, the data indicate that low nanomolar concentrations of BI 2536 induce cell-cycle arrest and cell death by
apoptosis.

was significantly inhibited following administration of the
third cycle of BI 2536 therapy. When mice were administered 25 mg/kg weekly on 2 consecutive days for a total of
only 2 cycles, tumor growth was inhibited after the second
cycle (Fig. 5B). Toxicity in these animals was limited to a
significant reduction in the numbers of neutrophils in the
bone marrow (Supplementary Fig. 1), which is the most
common side effect described in humans following treatment with BI 2536 (18, 19).
Because new agents for NB will likely be administered in
combination with front-line chemotherapeutics, we examined
a combination of a low dose of BI 2536 (12.5 mg/kg) with a low
dose of irinotecan (10 mg/kg), a topoisomerase inhibitor with
demonstrated activity in phase II clinical trials in relapsed NB.
Single-agent treatment with low-dose of either BI 2536 or
irinotecan was comparably efficacious, resulting in significant
growth inhibition, as compared with vehicle-treated animals
(Fig. 5C). Treatment with both drugs together resulted in
further growth inhibition and improved survival, compared
with treatment with the single agents (Fig. 5C). The potency,
selectivity, and limited toxicity of BI 2536 in culture and in the

xenograft model suggests that this compound and other PLK1
inhibitors merit consideration as novel agents for the treatment of NB.

Discussion
In this study, we screened a kinase inhibitor library to
identify candidate protein kinases that play a role in NB
TIC survival and self-renewal. To our knowledge, this is the
first published report using such libraries in NB and, in
particular, in primary human NB TICs from patients with
often fatal bone marrow metastases. In this study, we chose to
screen NB TICs for a number of reasons. First, NB TICs are
primary cells derived from bone marrow metastases of
patients with high-risk and often fatal NB that are passaged
for a limited number of times in culture (below passage 15).
Second, NB TICs express NB and neural crest progenitors
markers and have chromosomal aberrations typical of NB
tumors (ref. 6); Hansford and colleagues, manuscript submitted). Third, these cells are enriched in tumor-initiating
capacity because as few as 10 cells are required to recapitulate

metastatic NB in immunodeficient mice when injected orthotopically into the adrenal fat pad. Finally, the 3 NB TIC lines
used in this study do not carry MYCN amplification, which
allows dissection of the cellular events in non–MYCN-amplified tumor cells that represent approximately 80% of NB
patients. Therefore, we believe that NB TICs represent an
excellent and relevant model system to study the biology of
metastatic NB.
A number of potential kinase targets for NB TIC survival
and self-renewal including PI3K/Akt, PKC, Aurora kinase, and
Trk were identified. These findings are in agreement with
reports showing that Akt or TrkB activity (20, 21) and Aurora A
overexpression (22) regulate the proliferation or survival of
established NB cell lines from high-risk patients. Moreover,
the Trk-selective inhibitor lestaurtinib (CEP-701) has shown
potency in a preclinical NB model (23). Our study also revealed
several novel promising NB targets, such as ErbB2, PDGFR,
PIM1, eEF2K, and CK1 (casein kinase 1), which require further
investigation. Two compounds that showed a favorable selectivity profile, JNJ-10198409 (PDGFR) and IC261 (CK1), are
currently undergoing further assessment both in vitro and
in vivo.
PLK1 is a serine/threonine kinase that plays an essential
role during mitosis (24, 25). Because PLK1 is overexpressed in
many cancers and its upregulation often correlates with poor
prognosis (12, 24, 26), it has been studied as a potential
therapeutic target in adult cancers (11, 13, 16, 27–29). PLK1
has also been suggested to be important in NB cells, as siRNAmediated PLK1 knockdown induces DNA damage in MYCNamplified, established NB cell lines (30). Our study, using PLK1
siRNA knockdown and 3 PLK1 inhibitors, identifies PLK1 as a
critical protein for NB survival, self-renewal, and tumorigenicity. PLK1 inhibitors seem, at least in part, to induce growth
arrest and apoptosis in NB TICs by dysregulating and altering
the levels of the cell-cycle regulators cyclin B1 and p21. This

effect of PLK1 has been shown in a number of cell types (11, 16,
31) in which it promotes cyclin B1 degradation through the
phosphorylation of APC (anaphase-promoting complex).
Upon PLK1 inhibition or knockdown, the APC-degrading
function is impaired, which results in cyclin B1 accumulation
and perturbation of the cell cycle. We also observed in BI
2536–treated NB TICs an accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, a recently identified substrate for
PLK1 (17). The dysregulation of these important cell-cycle
regulatory proteins may likely induce growth arrest and
apoptosis in NB TICs with suppressed PLK1 activity. Taken
together, our results identify PLK1 as a required kinase for NB
TIC survival and self-renewal and PLK1 inhibitors as candidate NB therapeutic agents.
