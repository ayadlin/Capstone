Abstract
The addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy extends survival
among patients with HER2þ breast cancer. Prior work showed
that trastuzumab and chemotherapy augments HER2 extracellular domain (ECD)-speciﬁc antibodies. The current study investigated whether combination therapy induced immune responses
beyond HER2-ECD and, importantly, whether those immune
responses were associated with survival. Pretreatment and posttreatment sera were obtained from 48 women with metastatic
HER2þ breast cancer on NCCTG (now Alliance for Clinical Trials
in Oncology) studies, N0337 and N983252. IgG to HER2 intracellular domain (ICD), HER2-ECD, p53, IGFBP2, CEA, and
tetanus toxoid were examined. Sera from 25 age-matched controls
and 26 surgically resected HER2þ patients were also examined.
Prior to therapy, some patients with metastatic disease had
elevated antibodies to IGFBP2, p53, HER2-ICD, HER2-ECD, and

CEA, but not to tetanus toxin, relative to controls and surgically
resected patients. Treatment augmented antibody responses to
HER2-ICD in 69% of metastatic patients, which was highly
associated with improved progression-free survival (PFS; HR ¼
0.5, P ¼ 0.0042) and overall survival (OS; HR ¼ 0.7, P ¼ 0.038).
Augmented antibody responses to HER2-ICD also correlated (P ¼
0.03) with increased antibody responses to CEA, IGFBP2, and
p53, indicating that treatment induces epitope spreading. Paradoxically, patients who already had high preexisting immunity
to HER2-ICD did not respond to therapy with increased antibodies to HER2-ICD and demonstrated poorer PFS (HR ¼ 1.6,
P < 0.0001) and OS (HR ¼ 1.4, P ¼ 0.0006). Overall, the
ﬁndings further demonstrate the importance of the adaptive
immune system in the efﬁcacy of trastuzumab-containing regimens. Cancer Res; 76(13); 3702–10. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

including the humanized mAb trastuzumab, which speciﬁcally
recognizes the HER2 protein (1, 2). HER2 is part of a family of
transmembrane receptors and it is overexpressed in about 20%
of invasive breast cancers (3). HER2 has a well-established role
in breast cancer pathogenesis, and trastuzumab in combination
with chemotherapy has become the standard treatment for
patients with HER2þ breast cancer (4). The single-agent effectiveness of trastuzumab is limited in patients with HER2þ
metastatic breast cancer as only a fraction of patients initially
respond and among the responders, and a high proportion will
develop resistance to therapy within a year (5). The clinical
efﬁcacy of the combination of trastuzumab and chemotherapy
likely involves several pathways, which currently remain
incompletely understood (4). Increasing our understanding of
these pathways would yield several clinically useful advances.
First, identifying markers involved in antitumor response could
lead to the discovery and implementation of enhancements
that improve clinical efﬁcacy. Second, the identiﬁcation of
additional mechanisms of action could provide insights into
the biology of acquired resistance. Finally, predictive biomarkers of activity could identify patients most likely to beneﬁt
from trastuzumab and chemotherapy.
We published a small study that suggests an adaptive
immune response begins following initiation of combination
chemo- and trastuzumab therapy (6). Speciﬁcally, we examined

Increased understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of
breast cancer has led to the development of targeted therapies

Metastatic Breast Cancer: HER2 Immunity, Epitope Spreading

anti-HER2 antibody and T-cell responses in 27 patients with
HER2þ breast cancer and found that anti-HER2 antibodies were
detectable in approximately one-third of patients before combination chemo- and trastuzumab therapy that increased to
over half after initiation of treatment. Of the 22 individuals
treated for metastatic disease, patients with objective clinical
responses more frequently exhibited anti-HER2 antibody
responses than those with progressive or stable disease. In
addition, about one half of the patients developed concordant
HER2-speciﬁc CD4 T cells early in the course of treatment,
which is generally thought to be responsible for coordinated
immunity and IgM to IgG class switching (7). This preliminary
study established the hypothesis that adaptive immunity may
be associated with improved survival. In the current study, we
determined whether combination therapy induced adaptive
immune responses to HER2 and other tumor antigens and
whether immune responses were associated with improved
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

Patients and Methods
Patient populations
For this study, sera samples were acquired from 25 healthy
donors, 54 patients with HER2þ metastatic breast cancer who
participated in two North Central Cancer Treatment Group (now
the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology) trials, N0337 and
N983252, and 26 patients who participated in Mayo Clinic
Comprehensive Cancer Center Protocol MC1135 (Adjuvant treatment; Supplementary Table S1).
N0337 Metastatic breast cancer trial. This single-arm prospective
multicenter phase II study enrolled 45 evaluable patients from
March 2005 to June 2008. Patients received capecitabine (days 1–
14), vinorelbine on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks and trastuzumab
on day 1, week 1, and then every 3 weeks as ﬁrst- or second-line
therapy for conﬁrmed HER2þ invasive breast cancer with clinical
evidence of metastases. Duration of treatment (mean and median
times) with trastuzumab was 7.4 and 5.6 months, respectively,
(range 1.4–10.2 months, N ¼ 16; ref. 8).
N983252 Metastatic breast cancer trial. This two-arm prospective
multicenter randomized phase II study enrolled 91 evaluable
patients from September 1999 to July 2003. In Arm A, patients
(N ¼ 43) received every-3-week therapy consisting of paclitaxel,
carboplatin, and trastuzumab administered every 21 days for 8
cycles. In Arm B, patients (N ¼ 48) received weekly therapy
consisting of paclitaxel, carboplatin for 3 of 4 weeks, with trastuzumab administered every 4 weeks for 6 cycles. Duration of
treatment (mean and median times) with trastuzumab was 7.4
and 5.6 months, respectively, (range 2.1–15.9 months) in
N983252 Arm A (N ¼ 17), and 12.0 and 10.2 months, respectively, (range 3.0-37 months) in N983252 Arm B (N ¼ 21). Mean
and median time to metastatic disease for all patients, from initial
diagnosis, was 3.2 and 1.9 months, respectively (range 0–15.8
months; ref. 9).
Patients enrolled in N0337 and N983252 had not previously
received trastuzumab in any setting prior to enrollment and serum
samples were available from 54 patients in these two clinical trials
and 48 patients had paired pretreatment and posttreatment
samples. All posttreatment samples for both metastatic trials were
taken at the end of treatment at the time of disease progression,

death, or study closure (with the exception of one patient, for
which serum was taken at the time of evaluation where a response
was noted).
Adjuvant patient samples from Mayo Clinic Study MC1135. Sera
samples were collected from 26 nonmetastatic HER2þ breast
cancer patients treated in the adjuvant setting. A pretreatment
sample was collected following surgery and AC (doxorubicin
and cyclophosphamide) chemotherapy but prior to treatment
with paclitaxel and trastuzumab. The posttreatment sample was
collected at 4 months after initiation of adjuvant therapy. Mean
and median duration of treatment with trastuzumab was 10.5
and 11.8 months, respectively (range 3.5–14.1 months).
Normal healthy control samples. Twenty-ﬁve serum samples were
obtained from Bioreclamation and were similar to the metastatic
patients based on age, race, and gender. Informed consent was
obtained from all patients for obtaining biospecimens, and this
study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review
Board.
Direct ELISAs
Research-level ELISAs were conducted in the laboratory
of K.L. Knutson. Flat-bottom polystyrene 96-well microplates
(Fisher Scientiﬁc) were coated overnight at 4 C with 100
mL/well of 0.05 mol/L carbonate–bicarbonate buffer containing 20 ng/mL of HER2-intracellular domain (ICD; aa 676–
1255, Cell Sciences), HER2-extracellular domain fragment
(ECD Frag; aa 22-122, Novus Biologicals), p53 (Abcam),
insulin growth factor binding proteins 2 (IGFBP2; R&D Systems), or carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA; Abcam). HER2-ECD
Frag was used because it lacks the trastuzumab-binding site
that would interfere with detection of endogenous antibody
responses. Tetanus toxoid (TT, Calbiochem) was coated at 100
ng/mL. Human IgG (Sigma) was used as a protein standard
that was added at a concentration range of 25 to 0.195 ng/well.
All wash steps were carried out with PBS containing 0.05%
Tween 20 using a programmable automatic plate washer (Key
Scientiﬁc Inc.). PBS containing 1% BSA was used as blocking
and assay buffer for the ELISA. The wells were blocked with
200 mL/well of the blocking/assay buffer and were incubated
for 1 hour at room temperature on a rocking platform. After
washing again, human serum was added to the plate at a 1:100
dilution and plates were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. After washing, 100 mL/well of goat anti-human IgG
HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was diluted 1:2,000 and
incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. After a ﬁnal wash,
each well was incubated with 100 mL TMB substrate (BD
Biosciences). Color development was stopped by the addition
of 50 mL/well of diluted HCL. Absorbance was read at 450 nm
on a plate reader, which was subsequently converted into an
antibody concentration using the IgG standard curve.
Statistical analysis
Categorical variables were compared using a c2 test; antibody levels were compared with a paired t test or a two-sample
t test, whichever was appropriate. Comparisons among three
groups were made with an ANOVA test. For continuous variables with considerably skewed values, we used a sign-rank
test for paired data, a Wilcoxon rank sum test for unpaired
data, and Kruskal–Wallis for comparisons among three

groups. Kaplan–Meier plots were used to summarize patient
survival and curves for two or more groups were compared
using a log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards models were
also used to assess the relationship between antibody levels
and survival.

Results
Patients with HER2þ metastatic breast cancer demonstrate
elevated preexisting antibody immunity to multiple tumorassociated antigens
A previous study reported that only a small fraction (7%) of
patients with advanced (stages III and IV) HER2þ breast cancer
had elevated antibody immunity against HER2-ECD (10). In the
current study, we evaluated immunity toward HER2-ICD as well
as other tumor antigens (IGFBP2, P53, CEA) in patients with
either HER2þ metastatic or surgically resected breast cancers
(see demographics in Supplementary Table S1). Relative to the
levels of antibodies observed in normal healthy controls, patients
with HER2þ metastatic breast cancer demonstrated elevated levels
(> than the mean þ 2 SDs of the normal control levels) of
circulating antibodies to all of the antigens except TT (Fig. 1A–
F; Supplementary Table S2). Antibodies to TT were robust in
patients with metastatic disease as they were in controls. In
surgically resected patients, treated in the adjuvant setting, mean
concentrations of antibodies to tumor antigens did not differ
signiﬁcantly from healthy controls, and were signiﬁcantly lower
than levels observed in patients with metastatic disease with the
exception of antibodies to HER2-ECD Frag.
A comparison of the proportion of patients who had elevated
levels of antibodies was also performed. The approximate percentage of patients with HER2þ metastatic disease with preexisting antibody levels were 32% for IGFBP2, 50% for p53, 100% for
HER2 ICD, 20% for CEA, and 73% for HER2 ECD Frag (Fig. 1G).
None of the metastatic patients demonstrated elevated immunity
to TT relative to controls. It can also be observed from Fig. 1G that
the percentage of adjuvant HER2þ patients with preexisting
antibody levels were signiﬁcantly lower compared with the metastatic patients. These results demonstrate that HER2þ metastatic
breast cancer is naturally immunogenic.
Associations of the preexisting levels of antibodies to each of
the tumor antigens and TT with progression-free (PFS) and
overall survival (OS) were evaluated in the patients with metastatic disease using multivariable Cox proportional hazards
analysis, adjusting for time from initial diagnosis to the development of metastatic disease (mean ¼ 3.2 years; range 0–15.8
years). In contrast to expectations, preexisting antibody immunity to HER2 (both the ECD and ICD) was associated with a
poorer outcomes relative to those patients without preexisting
immunity (Table 1). Elevated antibodies to HER2-ICD and
HER2-ECD Frag were associated with PFS HRs of 1.64 (P <
0.0001) and 1.50 (P ¼ 0.009), respectively. Preexisting immunity IGFBP2, CEA, P53, and TT was not associated with PFS. A
statistically signiﬁcant association of preexisting antibodies
with overall survival (OS) was observed only for elevated levels
of HER2-ICD antibodies (HR ¼ 1.36, P ¼ 0.0006). Elevated
levels of antibodies to the other antigens were not found to be
statistically associated with OS despite preexisting antibodies
to those proteins. However, there appeared to be a trend for
antibodies to both HER2-ECD (P ¼ 0.07) and P53 (P ¼ 0.06) to
be associated with worse OS.

Antibody levels to multiple tumor-associated antigens increase
following treatment with trastuzumab and chemotherapy in
patients with HER2þ metastatic breast cancer
We previously observed that treatment of HER2þ metastatic
breast cancer patients with trastuzumab in combination with
chemotherapy increased the mean levels of lambda subtype IgG
antibodies speciﬁc to the ECD of HER2 (6). In the current study,
we compared pretreatment and posttreatment total IgG (lambda
and kappa) antibody responses in the metastatic patients to
HER2-ECD as well other tumor antigens of interest including
HER2-ICD (Fig. 2). As predicted from our earlier work, treatment
led to an increase in the mean levels of antibodies to HER2-ECD.
Notably, we also found that patients generated immunity to the
HER2 ICD, IGFBP2, and p53 (See also Supplementary Table S3).
Treatment did not appear to increase mean levels of antibodies
against CEA or TT (Supplementary Table S3).
We found that the induction of HER2-ICD–speciﬁc antibodies
(i.e. >25% increase in antibody levels) after treatment was highly
correlated with induction of antibody responses to the HER2-ECD
Frag as well as epitope spreading to other tumor antigens, (CEA,
IGFBP2, and p53; Table 2). In contrast, epitope spreading did not
correlate with the generation of antibodies to HER2-ECD (data
not shown). Finally, as multiple chemotherapy regimens were
used, we examined correlations with chemotherapies, ﬁnding that
the only signiﬁcant correlation was that a higher fraction of
patients in trial 983252 demonstrated induction of immunity to
HER2-ICD (Supplementary Table S4). This could suggest that the
immune system may be more responsive in the presence of
carboplatin and paclitaxel as opposed to capecitabine and vinorelbine combinations. Overall, our results demonstrate that treatment with combination trastuzumab and chemotherapy resulted
in the induction of HER2-ICD immunity as well as epitope
spreading to other common tumor antigens.
The generation of HER2-speciﬁc immunity is associated with
improved PFS during treatment with trastuzumab and
chemotherapy
Using a posttreatment antibody level of 125% of baseline as
the cutoff for a positive response, we observed that the generation of HER2-ICD or HER-ECD Frag antibody responses
(Table 2; Fig. 3A and B) were signiﬁcantly associated with
improved 1-year PFS (log-rank P ¼ 0.004 and P < 0.001,
respectively). When adjusted for the time from pretreatment
to posttreatment blood draws (median ¼ 9 months; range: 3–
30 months), the association with improved PFS remained
signiﬁcant (Table 3). Antibody responses to other tumor antigens (i.e., epitope spreading) were not signiﬁcantly associated
with PFS (Supplementary Table S5).
None of the antibody responses were signiﬁcantly associated
with OS by univariate analysis, although an association of
HER2-speciﬁc immunity was close to statistical signiﬁcance
(P ¼ 0.06; Fig. 3C and D; Supplementary Table S6). However,
when the model was adjusted for posttreatment collection
time, which accounts for the number of total cycles of trastuzumab, antibody responses for HER2-ICD and HER2-ECD Frag
were signiﬁcantly associated with improved OS (P ¼ 0.038 and
P ¼ 0.026), respectively (Table 3). Similar to PFS, antibody
responses to other tumor antigens were not signiﬁcantly associated with OS (Supplementary Table S6). Thus, as opposed to
the preexisting immunity, therapy-induced immunity was associated with improved survival.

was compared with their preexisting immune response in scatter
plots using linear regression (Fig. 4). For all antigens, there was a
statistically signiﬁcant negative correlation (P < 0.01) between
preexisting immunity and the change in the immune response.
Notably, patients with the highest preexisting immunity tended
have declines in the levels of immune responses during treatment.

and chemotherapy not only further augments immunity against
HER2 but also may change the immune response from pathogenic to protective. While we also provide evidence of preexistent
or augmented immunity to other breast cancer antigens, we were
unable to see a similar relationship to survival as was seen with
immunity to HER2. A ﬁnal notable observation made is that

NOTE: Data adjusted for time from initial diagnosis to metastatic breast cancer.
All P values for interaction between antibody levels and years to metastasis are

Mean antibody levels to tumor-associated antigens do not
increase after treatment with trastuzumab and chemotherapy
in patients with HER2þ adjuvant breast cancer
To determine whether combination trastuzumab and chemotherapy also resulted in increased antibodies in patients
treated in the adjuvant setting, we compared pretreatment and
posttreatment levels (4 months after initiation of treatment). In
contrast to what was observed for patients treated in the
metastatic setting, we did not observe any statistically significant increases in mean antibody levels (Supplementary Fig. S1;
Supplementary Table S7).
The fractions of patients in the metastatic and adjuvant
groups that responded with elevated (deﬁned as >25%
increase) antibodies after treatment was compared as shown
in Supplementary Fig. S2. A higher fraction of patients treated
in the metastatic setting responded to IGFBP2 (54% vs. 8%; P <
0.0001), to p53 (44% vs. 15%; P ¼ 0.02), and to HER2-ICD
(69% vs. 24%; P ¼ 0.0002). The difference in HER2-ECD Frag
responses did not signiﬁcantly differ between the metastatic
patients and the adjuvant patients (63% vs. 47%, P ¼ 0.22), a
ﬁnding that is consistent with our previous report that surgically resected patients elicit immunity to the ECD following
treatment with trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy (6). The difference in the percentage of metastatic or
adjuvant patients that demonstrated elevated immunity to TT
following treatment did not statistically differ. Thus, these
results show that while surgically resected patients treated in
the adjuvant setting with trastuzumab in combination with
chemotherapy generate HER2-speciﬁc immunity, immunity is
limited predominantly to the HER2 ECD with minimal epitope
spreading to HER2-ICD and other local tumor antigens.

Discussion
These results demonstrate that patients with HER2þ metastatic
breast cancer have elevated levels of antibody immunity against
HER2 and other well established tumor antigens prior to initiation of combination trastuzumab and chemotherapy compared
with patients with earlier stage HER2þ breast cancer. Preexisting
immunity to HER2 appears to be deleterious associating with
poorer PFS and OS. Despite that, the combination of trastuzumab

surgically resected patients treated in the adjuvant setting had little
evidence of preexisting immunity, which was not augmented
during therapy with trastuzumab-based regimens.
Because the trials from which we obtained specimens did not
have monotherapy arms, the current study was not designed to
detect the component of the therapy, either the chemotherapy
or trastuzumab, or both, that induces adaptive immunity. One
could postulate that the primary driver of adaptive immunity is

trastuzumab mediated through activating antigen-presenting
cells that take up antibody-complexed HER2 in the tumor
microenvironment (11). Alternatively, Fcg-mediated ADCC
may lead to apoptosis releasing antigens to which the immune
system is not tolerant to (e.g., p53). Regardless, that trastuzumab is the primary mediator of activating the adaptive immune
system is supported by several lines of evidence. For example,
we recently published, in the adjuvant setting following surgical resection in the N9831 phase III clinical trial that patients
on chemotherapy alone do not generate anti-HER2 antibody
responses, whereas the majority of patients treated sequentially
with paclitaxel followed by trastuzumab do (12). In further
support, we also found in our previous smaller study that
administration of trastuzumab as monotherapy resulted in
induction of anti-HER2 antibody in 2 of 3 metastatic patients
(6). Finally, in animal modeling of the effects of trastuzumab,
Park and colleagues recently found that monotherapy of mice
bearing HER2þ tumors induced tumor-speciﬁc CD8þ T-cell
responses that played a crucial role (13). Together, these results
collectively demonstrate that anti-HER2 mAb therapy is necessary and sufﬁcient for the activation of the adaptive immune
response.

One of the key ﬁndings in our study is the generation of
immunity to antigens other than HER2 following treatment,
which is reminiscent of epitope spreading induced by vaccination.
Epitope spreading is a phenomenon ﬁrst described in the case of
autoimmune disease (14). Theoretically, epitope spreading represents endogenous processing of antigen at sites of immune
activation initiated by a speciﬁc T-cell response. Indeed, although
we were unable to study T-cell responses in the current study, we
previously reported that trastuzumab and chemotherapy induce
activation of HER2-speciﬁc T-cell responses (6). Epitope spreading has been identiﬁed after immunization with cancer vaccines.
For example, we found that immunization with HER2 T helper
peptide-based vaccines resulted in epitope spreading within the
HER2 protein and to other tumor-associated antigens (15, 16).
Epitope spreading has been linked with the progression and tissue
destruction in several autoimmune disorders such as arthritis,
systemic lupus erythematosus, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and multiple sclerosis (17). The phenomenon of epitope
spreading has been linked with survival beneﬁt after immunotherapy in patients with cancer (18–20). In contrast, in our study,
we did not see any beneﬁt of the generation of immunity to other
tumor antigens beside HER2.
Preexisting immunity has been observed in prior studies in
patients with advanced HER2þ breast cancer. Our group previously reported that patients with HER2þ breast or ovarian
cancers had preexisting T-cell and antibody immunity to HER2
(10). In that sampling of advanced stage (III and IV) breast or
ovarian cancer patients, HER2-ECD–speciﬁc antibodies were
detected in only three of the 45 patients examined. In stark
contrast, in the current study, we found a markedly higher
percentage of metastatic patients demonstrating preexisting
immunity, speciﬁcally 100% demonstrated preexisting immunity to the HER2-ICD and 73% to the HER2-ECD fragment. The
reasons for the striking differences in the percentage of patients
demonstrating preexistent immunity is unclear but could be
due to several factors. First, in the prior study, the patient

3708 Cancer Res; 76(13) July 1, 2016

population consisted of both stage III (n ¼ 17) and IV (n ¼
28) patients and it may be possible that the generation of
immune responses is proportional to the antigen load, which is
likely to be higher in patients with more advanced stage IV
(metastatic) disease who tend to have more tumor volume than
those with localized earlier stage disease. Indeed, this would be
consistent with previous studies of patients with NY-ESO-1
antibody who tend to have advanced stage higher burden
disease (21, 22). Second, we also examined unique recombinant HER2 regions, HER2-ECD Frag and HER2-ICD; in our
prior studies, whole recombinant HER2-ECD was used, which
may have had differential exposure of antibody-binding
regions due to different folding or glycosylation patterns inherent in the synthetic preparation (23).
The magnitude of the preexisting HER2 antibody response in
patients with metastatic disease was an important factor and was
strongly associated with poor survival following treatment with
combination trastuzumab and chemotherapy. This observation is
somewhat paradoxical given that increased antibodies are associated with better survival in other studies (24, 25) and that we
observed signiﬁcantly improved PFS and OS in those patients
who demonstrated an increase in HER2-speciﬁc antibody
responses while on treatment. One possible explanation is that
patients with preexisting HER2-speciﬁc immunity may harbor
more aggressive immunoedited metastatic lesions that demonstrate lower or no levels of HER2 expression, which could be
addressed to extent by evaluating both the extent of pre- and
posttreatment of HER2 expression as well as levels of inﬁltration.
However, because the patients were all metastatic patients, samples of tumor were not available. The possibility of immunoediting is underscored by recent studies that show that HER2 expression in distant metastasis is not always concordant with the
primary lesions. In one study by Lower and colleagues, for
example, there were 90 of 382 cases in which the primary lesion
was HER2þ while the metastatic lesions were HER2 (26). Also,
recent work in early-stage HER2þ breast cancer shows that induction of immune responses leads to outgrowth of HER2-loss
variants (27, 28).
Alternatively, the poor survival in the patients with elevated
preexisting immunity could be the result of the inability to
maintain or augment preexisting immunity during combination
therapy. The reasons for this remain unclear, but the preexisting
immune response may have been eliminated or suppressed by the
chemotherapy, which might have preferentially targeted an active
immune response that was occurring at the time of initiation
of chemotherapy, rendering a void in the numbers of antigenspeciﬁc B cells available for eradication of the tumor over the
course of therapy. In contrast, those patients with lower level or
normal preexistent immune reactivity may not have been generating an active immune response prior to therapy and may have
escaped chemotherapy-induced immune suppression. Indeed,
several chemotherapeutic regimens are known to suppress antibody responses during vaccination (29, 30). We considered the
possibility that the different chemotherapy regimens used in the
metastatic patients (capecitabine and vinorelbine in N0337,
paclitaxel and carboplatin in N983252) could differentially inﬂuence induction of immunity and address the role of chemotherapy. We found that the ability to generate immune responses did
not differ signiﬁcantly between patients in N983252 and N0337
for most antigens, speciﬁcally CEA, P53, IGFBP2, TT, and HER2ECD antigens. However, we did observe that a higher percentage

Metastatic Breast Cancer: HER2 Immunity, Epitope Spreading

of patients in N983252 who generated an immune response to
HER2-ICD (78%) compared with N0337 (50%), which could be
related to the pronounced inhibitory effects of nucleoside analogues on humoral immune responses to vaccination (29).
These results suggest that combination treatment results in
induction of adaptive immunity to antigens released by tumor
and that the adaptive immune response speciﬁcally to HER2 may
have a signiﬁcant correlation with disease outcome. These ﬁndings may pave the way to the development of biomarkers predictive of therapeutic outcome and new therapeutic strategies
with mAbs.
