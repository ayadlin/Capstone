ABSTRACT
More than 30% of human protein-coding genes form hereditary complex genome
architectures composed of sense-antisense (SA) gene pairs (SAGPs) transcribing their
RNAs from both strands of a given locus. Such architectures represent important novel
components of genome complexity contributing to gene expression deregulation in
cancer cells. Therefore, the architectures might be involved in cancer pathways and,
in turn, be used for novel drug targets discovery. However, the global roles of SAGPs
in cancer pathways has not been studied. Here we investigated SAGPs associated with
breast cancer (BC)-related pathways using systems biology, prognostic survival and
experimental methods. Gene expression analysis identified 73 BC-relevant SAGPs that
are highly correlated in BC. Survival modelling and metadata analysis of the 1161 BC
patients allowed us to develop a novel patient prognostic grouping method selecting
the 12 survival-significant SAGPs. The qRT-PCR-validated 12-SAGP prognostic
signature reproducibly stratified BC patients into low- and high-risk prognostic
subgroups. The 1381 SAGP-defined differentially expressed genes common across
three studied cohorts were identified. The functional enrichment analysis of these
genes revealed the GABPA gene network, including BC-relevant SAGPs, specific gene
sets involved in cell cycle, spliceosomal and proteasomal pathways. The co-regulatory
function of GABPA in BC cells was supported using siRNA knockdown studies. Thus,
we demonstrated SAGPs as the synergistically functional genome architectures
interconnected with cancer-related pathways and associated with BC patient clinical
outcomes. Taken together, SAGPs represent an important component of genome
complexity which can be used to identify novel aspects of coordinated pathological
gene networks in cancers.

INTRODUCTION

evolutionarily organized in specific structural (and
often functional) hereditary units. In terms of genetic
architecture they can be classified into divergent (“headto-head”), convergent (“tail-to-tail”) and embedded (“one
inside another”) orientations [2, 4] comprising 29, 33 and
38%, respectively [5].
The physical interconnections of such paired
genes indicate their evolutionary and functional
relationships between them and specific control co-

RNA transcripts of sense-antisense (SA) gene
pairs (SAGPs) represent a large subset of the human
transcriptome varying from 30 to 50 % at all loci [1-3].
The gene partners of an SAGP (i) are located on different
strands of a chromosome, (ii) share a common locus and
(iii) are transcribed in opposite directions. Therefore,

regulatory mechanisms [2, 4, 6]. One antisense transcript
can lead either to activation or suppression of its sense
transcript counterpart [2, 4]. Many reports documented
the association of individual SAGPs with disease and
cancer[7-9] (for a more detailed review refer to [10]),
suggesting that SAGPs might be directly involved in
disease [11, 12]. Global deregulated patterns of SA
transcripts and gene pairs in cancers have also been well
documented [5, 13-16]. In this context, a comprehensive
approach to localize “hotspots” of deregulated antisense
transcription [17], clarification of their global regulatory
mechanisms and their involvement in pathobiological
pathways in cancer could be clinically relevant.
Two approaches predominate the field of SAGP
studies. The first approach is based on the detailed
characterization of a single SAGP, focusing on diverse
molecular mechanisms of SA transcription and posttranscription events and their involvement in cancer
or other diseases. For example, a post-transcriptional
mRNA stabilization mechanism has been found for p53
expression due to double-stranding p53 mRNA with the
Wrap53 gene mRNA [8], which might be relevant in many
cancers. High expression of the MYCN cis-antisense gene
NCYM is associated with poor prognosis in neuroblastoma
via promotion of production of anti-apoptotic protein
Myc-nick [18]. Sharing a bidirectional promoter leads
to coordination of gene expression levels for BAL/BBAP
SAGP, providing optimal interaction of their protein
products in chemoresistant, diffuse, large-cell lymphomas
[19]. An advantage of this approach is that it can
potentially provide alternative pharmaceutical strategies
to activate/ suppress the expression of well-known and
important oncogenes/tumor suppressors. Specifically,
disease-related individual SAGPs might represent a
novel type of drug target for locus-specific, anti-sense
modulation of abnormally activated genes of interest [20,
21]. The disadvantages of such “single SAGP” studies are:
i) the lack of a complete physiological view at the level
of global cellular regulation and ii) the unclear relative
functional impact of the given SAGP in the context of the
entire functioning set of SA gene pairs.
The second approach implies systematic study
of SAGPs and their transcripts starting from the whole
transcriptome scale with consequent specification of
the specific subsets of transcripts/genes with common
characteristics. This approach is aimed to unravel the
general characteristics and mechanisms of SA phenomena
(e.g., their common relative impact on the complexity
of the transcriptome in disease and normal states, global
association with transcription, posttranscriptional and
posttranslational modifications) [5, 13, 16, 22, 23].
Here we studied the novel characteristics and
possible coregulatory mechanisms of SAGPs in breast
cancer (BC) using the second approach starting with
transcriptome analysis.
BC is a highly heterogeneous disease with distinct

morphological appearance and varied molecular features.
The development and progression of a breast tumor is a
complex and dynamic biological process. This complexity
is determined by multiple genetic and molecular factors
and components, including multiple genomic DNA
aberrations (which can dramatically affect expression of
large numbers of physically co-localized genes), global
epigenetic changes and the regulatory effects of noncoding RNAs. Our understanding of tumorigenesis and
related future therapeutic implications might substantially
benefit from the integration of different components
of genomic complexity and diverse omics data [24].
SAGPs and their products represent another component
of genomic organization and molecular complexity and
common molecular factors impacting BC tumorigenesis
and tumors development [15, 16, 25]. The SAGPs are
highly-populated complex architectures in the human
genome and they may be patho-biologically important and
clinically useful.
The main goal of this study is the consequent
identification and characterization of the prognostically
significant SAGPs in BCs, which importance in
pathogenesis of cancers and in clinical oncology practice
is currently under-estimated. We assumed that because
SAGPs are evolutionary predetermined natural gene
architectures, coordinated expression of their gene
partners should be important for certain cellular functions
and, therefore, might be involved in specific regulatory
pathways in cells. In this context, studying SAGPs with
deregulated expression profiles of their gene partners
in specific pathologic BC subgroups/subtypes will
help to clarify in which abnormally activated cancer
pathways they could be predominantly involved. Here,
we considered only SAGPs for which each gene partner
encodes a protein (protein coding-coding SAGPs)
because these SAGPs are much better annotated and more
evolutionarily conserved than the other SAGP subclasses
[5]. The expression patterns of both genes in an SAGP
could be mutually or directionally co-regulated [21,
26], affecting the levels of both their RNA and protein
products, which could significantly impact cell fate.
Additionally, we introduced a concept of the
prognostic SAGPs-based signature as an important
component of our entire meta-analysis workflow to
identify and characterize SAGPs-associated deregulated
molecular pathways and the potential regulatory factors
of SAGPs in BC cells. We developed a computational
approach for automatic identification of prognostic
SAGPs using our original survival prediction model and
feature selection algorithm. The algorithm implementation
identified the refined SAGPs-associated BC patients
survival subgroups, which in turn led to the discovery of
the 1381 SAGP-defined differentially expressed genes
(DEGs) and GABPA transcriptionally co-activated gene
network comprising many BC-relevant SAGPs, as well
as certain specific gene sets involved in the cell cycle,

proteasome and spliceosome pathways. We demonstrated
SAGPs as the synergistically functional genome
architectures interconnecting cancer-related pathways and
clinical outcomes.
The knowledge obtained in this study could be
useful for a better understanding of BC tumorigenesis
and tumor progression as well as for novel, optimized
pharmaceutical strategy development.

expressed genes for individual SAGPs. The functional
characteristics of such gene pairs were studied here
for the identification of possible regulatory molecular
mechanisms of BC development, associated with the
expression patterns of SAGPs.
Thirdly, we selected the 73 BC-relevant SAGPs set
(73-SAGPs), for which: i) the expression values of gene
partners in a given SAGP were significantly correlated
in the histologic grade 3 breast tumor datasets and ii) the
differences of the distributions of correlation coefficients
between gene partners of the SAGPs were significantly
associated with the differences in the pathobiological
status of breast tissue samples (e.g., normal vs. tumor) and
clinical outcomes of BC patients.
Among the 73-SAGPs, we identified the most
significant prognostic paired gene sub-set, termed SA
gene signature (SAGS), which reliably dichotomized the
patients into low-risk (LR) and high-risk (HR) cancer
development subgroups. SAGS-based stratification
was followed by differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
and functional annotation and gene ontology (FA/GO)

RESULTS
Workflow of our study
The workflow shown in Figure 1 specifies our
genomic architecture-centered approach to the genomewide analysis of the expression patterns of physically
associated genes composing SAGPs. Firstly, we focused
on the analysis of the well-annotated protein codingcoding SAGPs [5]. Secondly, we analyzed the gene pairs
based on their expression levels and correlations of the

biological processes, pathways and genes associated with
BC patient clinical outcome stratification.

and ChIP-seq data analyses.

like” subtypes [29] (Supplementary file 2: Methods and
Analyses, Supplementary file 3: Figure S1A). The intrinsic
tumor subtypes classification annotation has been used
according to the information available in the original
data sets (Supplementary file 2: Table S11). Screening of
significantly correlated SAGPs (Kendall’s Tau correlation,
p < 0.05) within G3 basal-like tumors in three independent
patient cohorts revealed that 40 correlated SAGPs were
common across these 3 cohorts (Supplementary file
3: Figure S1B and Supplementary file 1: Table S1B).
The gene partners in each of the 40 pairs had positive
correlation coefficient values (Supplementary file 1: Table
S1B). We also identified 52 significantly and positively
correlated SAGPs in the non-basal-like tumor subgroup. A
total of 21 of the 40 SAGPs were significantly correlated
in the G3 basal-like tumor samples, but not in the G3 nonbasal like tumor samples (Supplementary file 1: Table
S1C). Among the 42 genes of the 21 SAGPs, the DEG
analysis identified 14 significant genes, discriminating the
G3 basal-like from the G3 non-basal-like tumor samples
(t-test; Q-value < 0.05, Supplementary file 3: Figure
S1C). Among the genes significantly co-activated in G3
basal-like tumor samples, we identified 3 reproducible
and concordantly up-regulated SAGPs (ABI1/PDSS1,
DIS3/BORA and WDR77/ATP5F1). These pairs could
be considered as promising tumor subtype-specific, upregulated biomarkers of G3 basal-like breast tumors.
These pairs could have an advantage over the “downregulated” biomarkers used in clinical studies for the
identification of basal-like BC subtype [30].
In total, using three independent BC cohorts, we
identified 73 SAGPs (73-SAGPs set) where the expression
levels of both genes in a given SAGP were significantly
correlated within the G3 basal-like and/or G3 non-basallike breast tumors. Hypergeometric test revealed a high
frequency of co-occurrence of significantly correlated
SAGPs, co-expressed in two studied data sets of G3
patients (Supplementary file 3: Figure S1B). This indicates
that the 73 selected, positively correlated SAGPs could be
involved in the same or interconnected gene regulatory
pathways and/or networks in the cells of G3 BC tumors.

Identification of BC-relevant SAGPs and their
characteristics within G3 breast tumors
To reduce the candidate list of clinically relevant
SAGPs, we aimed to identify a subset of SAGPs with
concordant expression of their gene partners. Using
the criteria of identification of BC-relevant SAGPs
(Supplementary file 2: Methods and Analyses), we
retrieved 728 non-redundant protein coding-coding
SAGPs, represented by 1383 gene symbol IDs from the
USAGP database [5] (the USAGP database supports
hg18 NCBI assembly). Among these SAGPs, 334 nonredundant SAGPs whose gene partners mRNA expression
was supported by at least one high-quality Affymetrix
U133A&B probe set presented in the USAGP database
(Supplementary file 1: Table S1A). Next, we focused
on the identification of the expression patterns of SAGP
gene partners within histological Grade 3 (G3) tumors.
G3 tumors represent a genetically distinct tumor class,
characterized by highly aggressive behavior, frequent
metastases, drug resistance and poor disease outcome [27].
We proposed that a selection of significantly correlated
SAGPs in this tumor class could help us to elucidate the
associations of co-expressed SAGPs with disease outcome
and pathobiological features in BC.
According to the current molecular classification,
breast cancers are classified into five intrinsic subtypes:
normal-like, luminal A, luminal B, ERBB2/HER2
“positive” and basal-like. G3 tumors are heterogeneous
and comprise mostly the luminal B, ERBB2/HER2
“positive” and basal-like subtypes. The basal-like subtype
is a highly aggressive carcinoma that is often resistant
to chemo- and hormonal therapy and has an increased
occurrence in patients with germline BRCA1 mutations
or in patients of African ancestry [28]. The basal-like BC
subtype, also known as predominantly “triple negative”
BC, often lacks the expression of estrogen, progesterone
and HER2 receptors. Because G3 basal-like tumors
represent the most challenging BC subgroup with respect
to chemo- and hormonal post-surgery therapy and clinical
outcome prediction, we also investigated the SAGPs as
discriminative biomarkers of basal-like tumors.
In this context, we considered the G3 basallike breast tumors and the rest of the G3 tumors as
two G3 subgroups. The subgroup of the G3 “nonbasal-like” tumor samples was represented by ERBB2/
HER2”positive”, luminal B, luminal A and “normalwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Discriminative characteristics of 73-SAGPs
between breast tumors and normal tissues and
between BC histologic grades
We further investigated whether the gene expression
correlation pattern of 73-SAGPs could reflect certain
essential BC genetically/clinically distinctive features,
such as differences between normal and tumor breast
tissues or between breast tumor grades.
We compared the cumulative frequency distribution
functions of the Kendall’s Tau correlation coefficient
values estimated between the gene partners of the
73-SAGPs in breast tumors and normal tissues (Figure

2A and 2B and Supplementary file 3: Figure S1D). There
were no significant differences between G3 basal-like
and G3 non-basal-like breast tumors or between the two
normal breast tissues used as negative controls (p>0.05,
KS test) (Figure 2A and Supplementary file 2: Table
S2). However, a highly significant systematic shift of the
correlation value distributions was evident for almost all
BC tissues compared to normal tissues (Figure 2A and 2B,
Supplementary file 2: Table S2).
The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests demonstrated
significant differences between the Kendall’s Tau
correlation coefficient values in high grade (G3) compared

to low grade (G1) breast tumors (Figure 2C and 2D) in
the 73-SAGPs. Taken together, the correlation coefficient
values between the in-cis gene partners of the 73-SAGPs
are significantly associated with different pathobiological
states of breast tissue (for instance normal vs. BC, G3
vs. G1 tumors). Therefore, as a co-activated functional
gene subset, they might be involved in deregulated
pathobiological gene networks and pathways in BC.
Next, we addressed the question of which molecular
mechanisms could be considered as potential regulators
of the 73-SAGPs in BC.

DNA CNVs is not a major factor of positive
correlations between the gene partners of the
73-SAGPs

in specific deregulated pathobiological pathways. Survival
prediction analysis can be used to investigate whether a
gene set contains genes and/or gene pairs significantly
associated with distinct survival/pathological outcomes
[33, 34]. Pathologically relevant gene signatures in turn
can be utilized for in-depth characterization of deregulated
oncogenic pathways and the discovery of potential drug
targets in cancer [33, 35-37].
Because gene pairs in 73-SAGPs are significantly
correlated, we assumed that a survival-significant SAGP
with a synergistic effect on a patient survival compared
to individual genes could be preferentially utilized as
a distinct stratification feature for survival prediction
analysis [25]. In this study we use the survival prediction
method called data driven grouping (DDg) method
(Materials and Methods; [25], [29, 34]) based on Cox
proportional hazards model and the selection procedure
using the optimal patient statistical partition models
(Supplementary file 2: Definitions) applied for every
SAGP. The most significant patient statistical partition
model is defined based on the cutoff values for both gene
expression values, each of which maximizes a separation
the relatively LR and HR prognostic groups.
We assessed the survival significance of the
73-SAGPs using our previously developed, 1-D DDg, 2-D
DDg and a novel 2-D RDDg procedures (Supplementary
file 3: Figure S5) [34].
The 2-D RDDg procedure was developed to obtain
less biased and more accurate patients stratification in
SAGPs compared to 2-D DDg (see Materials and Methods,
Supplementary file 2: Methods and Analyses). The 2-D
RDDg is a prognostic method of patient risk of disease
development stratification and the feature selection based
on generalization of the 2-D DDg method [34] (Figures 3
and 4). This method further refines patient partitioning by
adjusting the rotation of the horizontal and vertical axes
to yield a more optimal separation of the patient survival
curves (Supplementary file 2: Methods and Analyses and
Figure 3) than 2-D DDg. Similar to the 2-D DDg, the
improved 2-D RDDg allows for the stepwise selection of
synergistic survival-significant SAGPs.
Screening of the 73-SAGPs using the 2-D RDDg

Many pathological disturbances and abnormal
correlations between genes in cancers are due to their colocalization within the same DNA amplicons [31]. We
hypothesized that the significant and positive correlations
between the gene partners of the 73-SAGPs are specific
and are not due to DNA amplifications in the SAGPs loci.
To test this hypothesis, we selected 73 pairs of the nearest
gene-neighbors (NGNs) of the 73-SAGPs. The criteria for
selection of the NGNs are stated in Supplementary file 2:
Methods and Analyses and Supplementary file 1: Table
S3A.
CNVs often cover mega-base regions in the
human genome. Therefore, we expected that an SAGP
and its corresponding NGN pair could be located in
the same CNV region. Indeed, CNVs for NGNs were
very similar to those of corresponding co-localized
73-SAGPs (Supplementary file 3: Figure S2). Wilcoxon
matched pairs test revealed no significant differences in
the CNVs between gene sets of the co-localised NGNs
and 73-SAGPs studied in two independent data sets
(Supplementary file 1: Tables S4A-S4C, Methods).
In contrast, the Kendall’s Tau correlation coefficients
for “in-cis” pairs of co-localized NGNs were significantly
lower than the correlation coefficients for the “in-cis” gene
partners of the 73-SAGPs analyzed in the set of 38 BC cell
lines[32] as well as in another primary breast tumor cohort
(Figure 2E and 2F, Supplementary file 1, Table S3B).
These results suggest that CNV are not a major factor in
the positive correlation between the gene partners of the
73-SAGPs.

Identification of survival significant SAGPs
Because the 73-SAGPs demonstrated significant
associations with distinct BC pathological states and
subgroups, we hypothesized that they could be involved

in the Uppsala and Stockholm cohorts identified twelve
synergistic SAGPs (Table 2) that passed our criteria for
significance (Wald p-value < 0.05; common design of
2-D partition, the same gene expression cutoff values and
the same rotation angles) in both cohorts (Supplementary
file 1: Table S8) and were collectively termed the senseantisense gene signature (SAGS). Survival prediction
analysis (Supplementary file 1: Table S5) and literature
analysis (Supplementary file 2: Tables S6 and S7) of
the genes composing the 73-SAGPs and SAGS provide
evidence of the association of the studied genes with
cancer and suggest a possibility for their therapeutic
targeting.

obtained using either the 2-D DDg or the 2-D RDDg into
more integrated and significant patient partitions.
We also compared the performance of the 2-D
RDDg with that of the 2-D DDg in the Stockholm
cohort. The 2-D RDDg (Supplementary file 3: Figure
S7) provided more accurate (lower Wald p-value) patient
stratification for many of the analyzed SAGPs. Therefore,
the 2-D RDDg has an advantage over the 2-D DDg for
more accurate prediction of patient subgroups based on
clinical outcomes.
To ensure the robustness for identification of
pathological pathways associated with SAGPs, we
performed SAGS-based stratification in 2 additional BC
datasets (Metadata and Singapore) (Table 1). To ensure
the cross-cohort reproducibility of the SAGS stratification,
optimal stratification parameters of SAGS identified in the
Uppsala and Stockholm cohorts (design, rotation angle
and two gene expression cutoffs) were fixed and applied
in the Metadata and Singapore datasets. Applying the
WVG procedure after the 2-D RDDg using the SAGS
allowed us to significantly stratify (WVG Wald p < 0.01)
patients from the studied cohorts into low-risk (LR) and
high-risk (HR) subgroups (Figure 5A - 5D: Uppsala

The best RNA IDs for the corresponding Affymetrix probe sets were chosen. The priority selection criteria were defined
as follows: a) best ID by chromosome coordinates, b) well-characterised RefSeq NM IDs, c) RefSeq mRNA IDs, and d)
EST (expressed sequence tags) IDs.

sequence located within the territory of the SHMT1 host gene isolated from the clone, pUS1215 (BC cell line ZR-751, UCSC Genome Browser); ***: EST sequence isolated from the clone, H05D007L23(LIBEST_027875 RIKEN fulllength enriched human thymus cDNA library, UCSC Genome Browser), transcript presumably belongs to the LRRC59
host gene; ****: mRNA from the cDNA clone, MGC:23092IMAGE:4853730 (NIH_MGC_48 library, UCSC Genome

of transcripts belong to the pairs of host genes with sense-antisense overlaps, and they satisfy the criteria of survival
significance and synergism in two independent cohorts (Supplementary file 1: Table S8).
The cross-platform reproducibility of the
microarray-driven SAGS was assessed using qRTPCR (see Methods) in the BII-Origene cohort. We used

Metadata (p < 0.001) and Singapore (p < 0.0001). The
prognostic accuracy varied from 67.9% (Metadata) to

genes. The SAGS stratification in the same 42 BC patients
using either microarray or qRT-PCR gene expression data
showed strong concordance with the patient partitioning
into LR and HR subgroups (Cohen’s Kappa = 0.56, p
= 0.001) (Figure 5F and 5G). Images of frozen tumor
tissue sections (OriGene Technologies, predominantly G3
tumors) were independently verified by a pathologist from
Singapore (Supplementary file 1: Table S12). Using our
method, tumors were reclassified into 2 distinct clinical
subgroups (Figures 5F - 5K).
Taken together, the SAGS patients stratification,
as an important intermediate step in our study workflow
(Figure 1), resulted in the identification of reproducible,
clinically distinct BC patient subgroups associated with
SAGPs.

We assumed that SAGS-based patients survival
stratification reflects some fundamental patho-biological
properties and pathways of the BC types of the
relatively poor (HR) and good (LR) disease outcome
patient subgroups. To test this hypothesis, we identified
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the
subgroups.
DEGs between HR and LR subgroups, defined
above by the SAGS, were derived using the EDGE
software [39] providing the selection of high confidence
FDR-corrected DEGs. We analyzed data of Uppsala,

Stockholm and Metadata cohorts and selected several
thousand DEGs in each cohort. 1381 genes were common
for these three data sets (t-test FDR corrected Q-value
< 0.01, Supplementary file 1: Table S9A), suggesting a
reproducibility of these DEGs across the patient cohorts.
Noteworthy, this DEG set was highly-enriched with
201 breast tumor aggressiveness grading (TAG) signature
genes(Suppl. data in [27]) (118 out of the 201 TAG genes;
hypergeometric test, p = 44.3E-82, Table S9A), which
are mostly involved in the cell cycle, mitosis and cell
proliferation [27]. TAG is the microarray-based molecular

analogue of the histologic grading classifier of BC,
separating the histologic grade 2 (G2) BCs in the histologic
grade 1-like (G1-like) and histologic grade 3-like (G3like) tumor genetic sub-classes. This classifier proposes
two major genetically-defined classes of BC defined as
low-aggressive (G1+G1-like) and high-aggressive (G3like+G3) tumor classes with significant difference in
clinical outcomes. We also found that the SAGS-stratified
LR and HR BC subgroups are significantly correlated with
the patient subgroups obtained by the TAG signature [27].
The 71% (978/1381) of DEGs were up-regulated in

the HR patient subgroup. Using DAVID bioinformatics
software[40], we identified many biologically distinct gene
subsets, associated with cancer and its aggressiveness.
These gene subsets included the genes enriched under
the terms “Proteasome” (p = 5.5Ee-17), “Cell cycle” (p
= 3.3e-14), “DNA replication” (p = 2.1e-10) (KEGG_
PATHWAY), “DNA repair” (p = 1.09E-08) (GOTERM_
BP_FAT), “Spliceosome” (8.5e-05), “Pyrimidine
metabolism” (p = 1.8E-03), “t-RNA biosynthesis”
(p = 7.7E-03) (KEGG_PATHWAY). 188 genes out
of the analyzed 978 genes may encode the proteins
containing experimentally defined mutagenesis sites (p
= 2.4E-13, “mutagenesis site”, UP_SEQ _FEATURE)
(Supplementary file 1: Table S9B). Importantly, among
the 403 DEGs significantly down-regulated in the HR
subgroups, the gene terms associated with cell locomotion,
cell adhesion and cell migration were highly enriched
(Supplementary file 1: Table S9B).
Further analyses of 27 proteasome genes identified
under the DAVID term ”hsa03050: Proteasome”
revealed that they are evenly representing both the
20S core particle and the 19S regulatory particle of the
proteasome (Figure 6B). The 26 genes, listed under the
term “hsa03040: Spliceosome” (KEGG_ PATHWAY,

Table S9B), predominantly belong to the U2-, U4/U6snRNPs, including one gene of the PRP19 complex
(Figure 6B). The U1-, U2-snRNPs, the PRP19 complex
and the U4/U5/U6 tri-snRNPs predominantly participate
in the same specific stage of the spliceosome cycle, termed
the precatalytic spliceosome, or complex B. This stage
of the spliceosome cycle is followed by the assembly of
the catalytic spliceosome, or active complex C, in which
the chemical steps of splicing occur. The U4/U6 snRNP
is absent in complex C [41]. Interestingly, a literature
analysis of the spliceosomal DEGs suggests their potential
as highly promising anti-spliceosome drug targets
(Supplementary file 2: Methods and Analyses).
Thus, our meta-analysis using the 73-SAGPs
and the SAGS identified specific, HR prognostic BC
patient subgroups, whose tumors displayed distinct GO
characteristics. The profile of DEGs down-regulated in the
HR subgroups displayed enrichment in FA/GO terms for
cell locomotion, cell adhesion and cell migration.
The profile of DEGs over-expressed in the relatively
HR subgroups was significantly enriched for genes
involved in the cell cycle, DNA damage, DNA repair
and certain deregulated genes of the proteasome and
spliceosome.

GABPA provides a mechanistic link between the
73-SAGPs and certain cell cycle, proteasomal and
spliceosomal genes

The gene enrichment analysis revealed the strongest
significant enrichments of TFBMs for ETS-domain TFs
(GABPA, ELK1 and ELK4: Bonferroni corrected p =
1.4E-14, p = 9.2E-13 and 6.4E-11, respectively) in the
promoters of the 73-SAGPs. Less prominent enrichment
of TFBMs for GABPA and ELK4 was observed in
the NGNs set (p = 9.5E-06 and p = 2.4E-04), and no
enrichment was observed in the PNG set. The motifs for
GABPA were also overrepresented in the KEGG genes set
(p < 0.001), but not in the DEDR gene set. In contrast,
ERα, which is involved in BC cells proliferation and the
cell cycle in MCF-7 cells via the cyclin D1-CDK4/Rb/
E2F1 pathway [43], showed no TFBMs enrichment in the
proximal promoters of the studied gene sets.
Because the TFBM for GABPA (Figure 8A) showed
the strongest enrichment in the 73-SAGPs, we further
tested whether GABPA can preferentially bind to the
proximal promoters (-450/+50 bp) in the 73-SAGPs and
other gene sets. We observed the enrichment of GABPA
ChIP-seq binding regions (CBRs) in the MCF-7 BC
cell line for promoters of the same gene sets (compared
to PNGs and NGNs, Fisher’s exact test, Figure 8B).
Significant enrichment of GABPA CBRs in 73-SAGPs
was observed regardless of potential sharing bidirectional
promoters in divergent SAGPs (“73-SAGPs_unique” vs.
“73-SAGPs_all”). This fact suggested certain regulatory

Next, we studied whether the 73-SAGPs, the
proteasomal and spliceosomal genes could be driven by
any of the regulatory factors in BC cells. We analyzed
the proximal promoters (-450/+50 bp) for the enrichment
of transcription factor binding motifs (TFBMs) using
the Jaspar database from PSCAN software [42] in the
gene sets listed below. As negative controls, we used
3 gene sets: i) the set of 102 genes involved in PNGs
(Supplementary file 3: Figures S3 and S4, Supplementary
file 1:Table S3C), i.e., the pairs of co-localized and
robustly correlated genes in the same BC subgroups as
the 73-SAGPs but without SA overlaps; ii) the set of
146 NGNs (Table S3A) and iii) 150 top differentially
expressed, down-regulated genes in HR subgroups after
the SAGS stratification (DEDR genes set) (Supplementary
file 1: Table S9C, Methods and Analyses). The “KEGG
genes” set (148 genes) included differentially expressed,
significantly upregulated genes (Q-value < 0.01) in HR
subgroups classified by the SAGS in the three studied
cohorts and enriched under the DAVID category, “KEGG_
PATHWAY” (Supplementary file 1: Table S9C).

advantages of GABPA binding to proximal promoters of
73-SAGPs compared with the co-localised and correlated
pairs of genes without SA overlaps.
Similarly, significant enrichment of GABPA CBRs
in the promoters of the KEGG genes (including certain
cell cycle, spliceosomal and proteasomal genes) was
detected; however, this was not true for ERα CBRs
(Figure 8C). Additionally, dramatically lower frequencies
of GABPA CBRs in the DEDR genes supported a
regulatory role of this TF in the 73-SAGPs and in the

KEGG genes set (Figure 8B). Fourteen individual genes
and five distinct SAGPs from the SAGS have overlaps of
GABPA CBRs with their proximal promoters in MCF-7
cells (Supplementary file 1: Table S13).
Knockdown experiments of GABPA in MCF-7 BC
cells in eleven randomly selected convergent 73-SAGPs
(twenty two genes) with GABPA CBRs in their proximal
promoters (Supplementary file 1: Table S13) revealed
down-regulation of both gene partners in 9 cases. We
also observed downregulation in 5 out of 6 spliceosomal

upregulated SAGPs. The gene pairs ABI1/PDSS1, DIS3/
BORA and WDR77/ATP5F1 and their products could
be considered as promising up-regulated discriminative
biomarkers of G3 basal-like tumors, although further
experimental and clinical validation will be needed.
Next, we investigated whether the SAGPs with
positively correlated gene partners within G3 breast
tumors (73-SAGPs) are associated with tumor initiation
and/or aggressiveness. Further analyses revealed that the
73-SAGPs displayed significantly different correlation
profiles in BC samples compared to normal breast tissue
samples (Figure 2), indicating that they are relevant to
tumor initiation and malignancy. An overall systematic
positive shift of the correlation coefficient values
calculated between the gene partners in the 73-SAGPs
was observed in more aggressive tumors (G3) compared
to less aggressive tumors (G1). These findings suggest
the relevance of 73-SAGPs to tumor aggressiveness
and the disease clinical outcome. Several previous
studies suggested that the expression patterns of SAGPs
demonstrate cancer type- and subtype-specific expression
patterns and might be important for further clinical and
pharmaceutical implementations [5, 11-14, 20, 21].
Survival analysis and pathologically relevant gene
signatures are useful for the characterization of deregulated
oncogenic pathways and identification of potential drug

and in 3 out of 6 proteasomal genes with GABPA CBR/
proximal promoter overlaps (Supplementary file 3: Figure
S10). This result confirmed that GABPA can be a direct
transcriptional co-regulator of its predicted gene-effectors.

DISCUSSION
This study represents one of a few studies [11-14,
25] aimed at the systematic investigation of the expression
patterns of SAGPs in the context of cancer heterogeneity
and pathological pathways for better understanding their
impact in tumorigenesis and tumor progression, and for
optimized pharmaceutical strategies development.
We started with the correlation analysis of SAGPs
within the class of histologic G3 breast tumors, because
these tumors are highly aggressive and commonly develop
drug resistance and a spread of distant metastases. Within
the G3 tumor class, the basal-like tumors comprise
the most challenging subgroup with respect to postsurgery therapy. To test whether SAGPs can be used as
discriminative biomarkers of G3 basal-like tumors, we
combined correlation and DEG analyses and identified
SAGPs discriminating the G3 basal-like tumors from the
rest of G3 tumors, which we termed “non-basal-like”.
From 21 subtype-specific SAGPs positively correlated in
the G3 basal-like BC subgroup, we selected 3 concordantly

targets. Because the identified 73 BC-relevant SAGPs
could be involved in tumor initiation and aggressiveness,
we studied their association with BC patient survival and
applied feature selection methods based on the data-driven
grouping prognosis strategy [29, 34, 37].
We also developed a novel 2-D RDDg prognostic
method adapted for the refined survival analysis of
correlated gene pairs (including the 73-SAGPs). Our
screening workflow combining the 1-D DDg, 2-D
DDg, 2-D RDDg and WVG procedures [29] (see
Methods, Supplementary file 3:Figure S5) resulted in
the identification of the pathologically relevant SAGS.
Twelve of the twenty-four genes comprising the SAGS
(and used for construction of our SAGS) are reportedly
associated with various cancers. Seven genes (BORA,
DIS3, POLR2C, FAM175A, EME1, RNF139 and SHMT1)
are considered potential biomarkers and/or potential
targets for radiotherapy and chemotherapy, as well as
cancer susceptibility, cancer progression and metastasisrelated genes (Supplementary file 2:Table S7). SAGS was
applied and tested using large cancer microarray datasets
that encompassed eight independent BC cohorts (1161
tumors in total). SAGS significantly and reproducibly
stratified all breast tumors into LR and HR subgroups.
Next, our DEG and FA/GO comparative
analyses between LR and HR subgroups derived by
SAGS, revealed several crucial tumorigenic processes
and molecular functions associated with 73-SAGPs

expression that might be useful for future discovery of
novel prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. In
particular, proteasome- and precatalytic spliceosomespecific genes were enriched in the HR subgroups of
the studied BC cohorts. Several reports indicate that
antisense transcription and alternative splicing are
tightly and mechanistically coordinated processes [2,
22]. Alternatively, PRP19 complex, a key element
of precatalytic spliceosome [41], is also known as
an important regulator of proteasome degradation
[44]. Therefore, here we found functional links of SA
transcription with splicing and proteasome degradation
which might reflect the important inter-pathway
connections regulating the BC progression.
Although predominantly positive correlation profiles
of SA transcripts/gene pairs in cancers were previously
reported [5, 22], the exact molecular mechanisms
underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. Abnormal
positive correlations among many genes in cancers
could be due to their co-localization within the same
DNA amplicons and equivalent DNA CNV changes
[31]. Additionally, the specific molecular mechanisms
coordinating the expression of SA transcripts described
in the literature include i) the use of shared regulatory
regions for common TFs [45]; ii) chromatin activation in
SA overlapping regions, such as antisense-RNA-mediated
DNA demethylation [46]; iii) stabilization of a sense
transcript by its antisense transcript [7, 8]; iv) selective

AURKA are in concordance with literature [54, 55].
We speculate that the 73-SAGPs within the GABPA
gene network have a specific functional impact in BC
progression and clinical outcome. Firstly, GABPAdependent genes are involved in the regulation of cell
entrance into the S phase of the cell cycle, independent of
E2F1 [48]. Secondly, tight coordination and rewiring of
the expression between their gene partners via the other
SA related mechanisms [4]) could provide additional
advantages for BC cells.
The discovery of specific breast tumor subgroups
using SAGS and the GABPA gene network was possible
due to our original, biological knowledge-driven, genomic
architecture-centered meta-analysis approach (Figure
1). We highlight the importance of the preliminary preselection of SAGPs using correlation analysis, followed
by the application of the 2-D RDDg developed for optimal
survival analysis of SAGPs (Supplementary file 3: Figure
S7). In the framework of this study, we assumed that genes
that are evolutionary organised into SAGPs could acquire
additional structural features and functions, providing
certain advantages not only for the development of normal
tissues but also in the tumorigenic process for certain
subsets of BC tumors and can be regulated via distinct
molecular factors/mechanisms.
Despite the extreme complexity of the human
genome, the selection of appropriate negative controls
(NGNs and PNGs, Supplementary file 2: Methods and
Analyses) for the studied object (BC-relevant SAGPs)
made it possible to identify and partially characterize the
phenomena of the BC-relevant SAGPs as well as their
potential mechanistic regulators.
For the first time, we found that cell cycle,
proteasomal and spliceosomal gene sub-networks can be
co-activated via GABPA in the same high risk BC patients
(Figure 9), which might be useful for future clinical studies
and practice in BC. Bortezomib, as an anti-proteasome
agent (targeting the 20S-proteasome subunit) is an FDAapproved drug for multiple myeloma and is actively
involved in several phase I/II BC clinical trials, including
in combination with standard chemo- and endocrine
therapies [56-58]. Anti-spliceosome drugs, as a novel
treatment for cancer have been actively discussed in the
literature (Supplementary file 2: Methods and Analyses),
although they are currently just in the pre-clinical stage
[59]. Recently, a novel drug targeting the 19S-proteasome
subunit, b-AP15, was identified and successfully tested in
a pre-clinical study against several cancers, including BC
[60]. b-AP15-dependent targeting of proteasome [61] or
siRNA-mediated targeting of spliceosome components
[62] resulted in the same specific cellular phenotype:
autophagy and reduction of viability in highly malignant
BC cells. Hence, in the context of future clinical trials
and the GABPA gene network (Figure 9), it is possible to
suggest some alternative options for clinical treatments to
improve BC patient outcomes: i) traditional chemotherapy

alternative pre-mRNA maturation [22, 47]. In this report
we investigated two first mechanisms in more detail.
Because DNA CNV might be not a substantial
coregulatory factor of the 73-SAGPs (see Results), we
further investigated whether certain TFs are the potential
regulators of the 73-SAGPs. The proximal promoters of
the 73-SAGPs were significantly enriched in TFBMs and
CBRs for GABPA (Figure 8) compared to the negative
control sets of paired genes without sense-antisense
overlaps (NGNs and PNGs). Knockdown of GABPA in
MCF-7 cells confirmed its direct regulatory role of the
73-SAGPs in BC cells (Supplementary file 3: Figure S10).
GABP is necessary and sufficient for quiescent cells
to re-enter the S phase of the cell cycle, independent of
D-type cyclins, CDKs and E2Fs [48]. Several pieces of
evidence support the idea that GABPA is an important gene
in the regulation of lineage-restricted genes [49] and stem
cell renewal and differentiation [50, 51].
Here we identified the specific GABPA-dependent
gene network, which includes not only divergent (headto-head configuration) but also convergent 73-SAGPs
(tail-to-tail configuration) [5] (Figure 8B). Although we
focused on GABPA, several other ETS-domain factors
(e.g., PEA3, ERM, ETS-1, ETS-2 and ESE-1[52]) are not
excluded as alternative regulators for many genes of the
network during BC progression.
In context of the GABPA gene network, we can
suggest two models of transcriptional coordination of
gene partners in the BC-relevant SAGPs. The first model
incorporates the known mechanism of sharing common
TF in bidirectional promoters of divergent SAGPs
[19] because it was shown that GABPA can regulate
bidirectional transcription [53] (Figure 7A). The second
model implies parallel coordination of the expression
of SA transcripts in a convergent SAGP via the same
TF (Figure 7B). The latter model is supported by: i)
significant enrichment of the GABPA CBRs in proximal
promoters of convergent SAGPs from the 73-SAGPs set
(Figure 8) and ii) the gene expression suppression effect
in both gene partners of convergent SAGPs after siRNA
GABPA knockdown in MCF-7 BC cells (Supplementary
file 3: Figure S10).
Stratification of BC patients using the SAGS
followed by DEG and FA/GO analyses allowed us to
extend the GABPA-dependent gene transcriptional
network. Similarly, the proximal promoters of DEGs
up-regulated in HR patient subgroups (identified by the
SAGS, the “KEGG genes”) were strongly enriched by
TFBMs and CBRs for GABPA. However, the full GABPA
gene network might be much wider, as indicated by the
higher frequencies of co-localized CBRs for GABPA in
NGNs/PNGs than in the total genome gene set (Figure
8B). Therefore, the 73-SAGPs combined with the KEGG
genes could be the representative “core” gene set of the
GABPA gene network (Figure 9). The identified GABPA
CBRs overlaps with the proximal promoters of SKP2 and

combined with anti-spliceosome treatment and ii) antiproteasome therapy combined with anti-spliceosome
treatment.
The identified set of concordantly co-regulated
73-SAGPs represents a potential gene pool for further
studies of the regulatory mechanisms of known or
promising novel gene candidates involved in BC
tumorigenesis and tumor progression.
Figure 8D shows an example of the convergent pair
DIS3/BORA as one of the proposed 73-SAGP candidates
for a future study of G3 basal-like breast cancers and
cell cycle regulation in BC. DIS3, encoding the exosome
endoribonuclease and 3’-5’ exoribonuclease, is a highly
conserved gene required for mitotic progression and is
involved in several cancers [63]. Silencing of DIS3 alone
affects the viability, migration and invasion of cancer cells
[63]. AURKA and PLK1 are direct interactors of BORA
at the G2/M transition in the cell cycle. The search of anticancer drugs targeting these genes to modulate mitosis
is actively ongoing [64], but the results are controversial
[65]. Firstly, the DIS3/BORA SAGP is significant and
synergistic in terms of patients survival in two independent
BC patients cohorts (Figure 4 and Supplementary file 1:
Table S8); both gene partners are significantly correlated
and activated in basal-like breast tumors (Supplementary
file 3: Figure S1C and Supplementary file 3: Figure S1C).
Secondly, GABPA is their common regulator in BC
cells (Figure 8D and Supplementary file 3: Figure S10).
Thirdly, in highly malignant HeLa cells, the cell cycle
time-course expression of both genes is significantly
associated with cell cycle periodicity (p(per) = 0.009 and
p(per) = 5.1E-15 for DIS3 and BORA, respectively) and is
mutually coordinated in cell cycle phases (Supplementary
file 3:Figure S9) [66].
Another candidate to study translation and
oncogenesis is the convergent AIMP2/EIF2AK1 SAGP
(Table 2). AIMP2(p38) is a crucial component of the
macromolecular aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. The full size
AIMP2 isoform has tumor suppressive properties based
on the protective interaction with p53. In contrast, the
alternatively spliced isoform AIMP2-DX2 is oncogenic
and compromises the pro-apoptotic activity of normal
AIMP2 through competitive binding to p53 [67]. Fusion
gene EIF2AK1-ATR is oncogenic and overexpressed in
androgen-independent prostate cancer cells[68]. EIF2AK1,
encoding the translation elongation factor kinase, and
AIMP2 are involved in regulation of translation. Both
genes were positively correlated in basal-like G3 tumors
in 3 independent BC cohorts (Supplementary file 1: Table
S1B) and are involved in the pathological GABPA gene
network. Several other deregulated components of the
same aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex were identified
in the GABPA gene network (Figure 9).
The 73-SAGPs might also be investigated in
context of locus-specific antisense modulation of known
or novel oncogenes [20, 21]. In this scenario, complete

direct blocking of a targeted abnormally activated sense
gene (e.g. oncogene) can lead to undesirable side effects;
however, experimental perturbation of its concordantly coactivated antisense partner could optimize the expression
level of its deregulated oncogenic sense partner. This
“soft modulation” model was [20] based on the previous
detailed experimental studies of individual SAGPs, such
as TP53/WRAP53 [8] in various cancers and BACE1/
BACE1-AS in Alzheimer disease [7].
The meta-analysis approach and the proposed datadriven model of the abnormally activated GABPA gene
network in BC could be used in potential applications
(Figure 10). Our model proposes: i) potential drug targets
for anti-proteasome and anti-spliceosome therapy within
the same GABPA gene network, in addition to traditional
adjuvant chemo- and hormonal treatment and ii) the
73-SAGPs representing a pool of co-expressed paired
genes could be used for in-depth studies of fine regulatory
mechanisms of tumorigenesis and tumor progression in
BC (Supplementary file 1:Table S13 and Figure 9). The
latter option also looks promising in case of a progress of
RNA-based drugs development and delivery in the nearest
future [69, 70].
Thus, we used our integrative approach to identify
novel aspects of the coordinated pathological gene
networks in cancers. This study provides novel promising
hereditary linked gene pairs associated with BC pathology
as well as new facts and knowledge for further in-depth
mechanistic studies. Our results suggest that SAGPs as
highly-specific and important components of genomic
organization in normal cells and pathological conditions
can be useful for the search for alternative therapeutic
targets.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Breast tumors, normal breast tissue samples and
microarray datasets
The collection of published datasets and our
BC dataset used in this study are summarised in
Supplementary file 2: Table S11.
The first dataset consisted of samples from the
Uppsala cohort, which represented BC patients resected
in Uppsala County, and the Stockholm cohort, which was
derived from BC patients operated on at the Karolinska
Hospital [27]. The second dataset consisted of samples
from 251 BC patients from France collected at the Institute
Paoli-Calmettes and Hospital Nord (Marseille)[71]. The
Harvard cohorts 1 and 2 datasets included primary breast
tumors obtained as anonymous samples from the NCIHarvard Breast SPORE blood and tissue repository [72],
[73]. The dataset of BC patients sample from the John
Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK and Guy’s Hospital, UK,

were selected from a multicentre study [74].
To obtain the additional training and testing groups
used to verify the SAGS, we combined the microarray
expression datasets from 5 independent BC cohorts
(Metadata: combined the Oxford, the Guys hospital
(GSE6532, GSE9195), the Harvard 2 (GSE19615), the
Marseille (GSE21653) and the BII-OriGene cohorts
(GSE61304), (Table 1 and Supplementary file1:Table
S12) with a consequent batch effect correction using
the ComBat software [75]. The quality of the combined
datasets was monitored using the arrayQualityMetrics
software [76].
The normal breast tissue microarray data included
normal epithelium tissue samples resected from benign
non-malignant lesions of women with a non-elevated risk
of BC undergoing reduction mammoplasty (fist dataset
[77], RM, n = 18). The second [77] (HN, n = 18) and third
[78] (AH, n = 62) datasets consisted of histologically
normal “tumor-adjacent” (i.e., located from 1cm to 2
cm from the tumor) epithelium samples obtained from
groups of women undergoing BC surgery who had not
undergone chemotherapy or radiation treatment before
tissue acquisition. The first and second datasets were agematched. For these datasets, the 53 SAGPs out of the total
set of 73-SAGPs, in which both members of a gene pair
were supported by at least 1 Affymetrix U133A probe
sets, were used for correlation analysis; all breast tissue
samples were obtained by laser-capture micro-dissection
[77]. In the third dataset, data on both U133A and U133B
microarrays were available, so all 73-SAGPs and 73 pairs
of NGNs were used for the correlation analysis.

may be improved and/or specified by analysing gene pairs.
Specialised statistical and computational methods are
required to reliably identify gene pairs (e.g., the predictive
interaction analysis (PIA) [79, 80] or the 2-dimensional
data-driven grouping procedure (2-D DDg) [29, 34] ). Due
to the sample size, cohort variation and the computerized
implementation of a mathematical model, the selection of
unbiased and high-confidence gene pairs was not a trivial
task. The 2-D DDg method [29, 34], which is based on a
non-linear, unsupervised prognostic and feature selection
model, can accurately classify the most common patterns
(designs) of gene relationships in pairs and explicitly
include interaction (synergy) effects in its statistical
procedure.
In the current study, gene pairs-based survival
prediction analysis was performed using either the
previously developed 2-D DDg [29, 34] and/or its
substantially improved extension, the 2-D RDDg
(Figure 3). In the 2-D DDg, in contrast to the 1-D DDg,
dichotomization of patients into distinct risk subgroups
was performed for each gene pair on a 2- dimensional
plane with horizontal and vertical axes corresponding to
the fixed gene expression value cut-offs. Our 2-D DDg
method is also distinct from the known PIA approach [79]
because i) it is described by a 2- dimensional (for two
interacting genes), not a linear, statistical model (when just
one value for a two-gene ratio or a two-gene product is
used); ii) the 2-D statistical model is more informative than
the gene ratio-based model for patients survival partition
because it uses the same 2 genes, 5 designs and 10 subdesigns (i.e., 10 prognostic scenarios, Supplementary file
3:Figure S6) in contrast to only 2 possible scenarios for
the same gene pair in the ratio-based model.
Because both genes of an SAGP are often
significantly correlated between each other (Figures 2
and 4), the bi-variate distributions of their gene-partner
expression values could deviate from a random “shotgun”
shape (Figure 4A1 and 4A2). In such cases, the 2-D DDg
model coordinates might be not optimal to reveal the
best survival patient partition in the 2-D gene expression
space. In the 2-D RDDg analysis (Figure 1), in contrast
to the 2-D DDg (Supplementary file 3: Figure S6), the
horizontal and vertical axes can be rotated at a varied
angle without losing their orthogonality. The 2D-RDDg
utilizes 7 designs, 14 sub-designs and 16 rotation angles.
The rotation property allows the 2D-RDDg to be more
flexible and to refine more accurate patient partitions than
can be achieved using the 2-D DDg.
The WVG procedure was used to combine the
survival information for multiple gene pairs into an
essentially improved integrated grouping (Supplementary
file 2: Methods and Analyses). Individual classification
patterns for selected survival significant genes or gene
pairs are organised in a matrix in a fixed order. Voting
procedure in the matrix is performed step-by-step for
each gene pair in descending order; for each individual

Survival prediction analysis
The Cox hazards model was used to parameterize
and compute the differences between the Kaplan-Meier
survival curves. P-values of the Wald test statistics were
used to evaluate the statistical differences between the
survival curves.
The 1-D DDg approach was used for the selection
of individual genes where expression threshold (cut-off)
value could be used to group the patients into distinct
disease development risks according to the survival timeto-event data [29]. Briefly, the patients were sorted-out
according to the expression values of a tested gene and
the gene expression values were fitted to survival times
and corresponding events (e.g., disease free survival, DFS)
using the Cox proportional hazards model; the optimal
gene expression cut-off value for each gene was estimated
by goodness-of-fit analysis on a one-dimensional linear
scale, maximising the separation between the sorted-out
patients into low- and high-risk subgroups, represented by
Kaplan-Meier survival curves [29].
Such survival prognostic methods utilise expression
data for individual genes as the features for survival
prognosis [34, 79]. In the cases of gene pairs, the method

patient, the predominant number of votes for each class
(”0” or ”1”) from all the genes/gene pairs in a given list is
used for the final integrated assignment of the patient to a
corresponding class (the low-risk “0” or the high-risk “1”
classes).
To stratify patients in diverse BC cohorts, we used
the refined 2-D RDDg procedure due to its higher accuracy
(Supplementary file 3: Figure S7, Supplementary file 2:
Methods and Analyses). However, the 2-D DDg procedure
is much faster to execute and, therefore, it could be useful
for massive screening purposes.

within specific regions of the corresponding Affymetrix
probe sets. The SA cDNAs of 42 patient samples were
pre-amplified (Life Technologies, Taqman PreAmp
Master Mix kit) using a gene-specific pool of SA
forward and reverse primers. TATA box binding protein
(TBP) was used as endogenous control. Taqman probes
were designed for all the sense and anti-sense genes, as
well as the endogenous controls. The 96 x 96 Dynamic
Array IFC was prepared according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Fluidigm, San Francisco, CA), as described
previously[81]. Quantitative PCR was performed using
a gene assay (1st BASE, Singapore), according to the
protocol of the Biomark System (Fluidigm, San Francisco,
CA). Reaction conditions were as follows: 50°C for 2 min,
70°C for 30 min, 25°C for 10 min, 50°C for 2 min and
95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15
sec and 60°C for 60 sec. Ct values were extracted, and the
data were processed using detector thresholds individually
set for each gene and a linear baseline correction using
the Biomark Real-time PCR Analysis software (v.3.0.4)
(Fluidigm, San Francisco, CA). The genes were relatively
quantified using the dCt method [82]. A list of forward and
reverse primers for both sense- and anti-sense genes and
the respective fluorescent Taqman probes labelled with a
FAM-TAMRA quencher is provided in Supplementary file
2: Table S10A.

Cross-cohort and cross-platform reproducibility
of SAGS
For cross-cohort validation of the SAGS (Table
2), patient stratification was considered significant if
two identified novel patients subgroups (high-risk, HR
and low-risk, LR) showed differences in the WVG Wald
test with p-value < 0.01. Patient stratification in the
training data set was considered valid if the significantly
different novel survival subgroups were identified
in a corresponding independent testing data set. The
BC cohorts used in the training and testing modes are
summarised in Table 1.
For qRT-PCR validation of the SAGS, we designed
a strand-specific qRT-PCR protocol for 9 of the 12
SAGPs from SAGS (eighteen genes, Supplementary
file 2: Table S10A) to exclude a potentially undesirable
gene-expression signal from an opposite DNA strand
within the SA overlap region. Forty-two breast tumors
(RNA samples; OriGene Technologies, Rockville, MD)
were stratified in parallel using either the U133Plus 2.0
microarray (Figure 5E) or qRT-PCR expression data
(Figure 5F) for the same genes and patients. The 2-D
RDDg and WVG procedures from the training mode were
independently applied to both data sets.

siRNA knockdown assay
MCF-7 cells were cultured in EMEM supplemented
with 10% FBS in a humidified incubator at 370C with 5%
CO2. For GABPA knockdown experiment MCF-7 cells
were transfected with ON-TARGETplus siRNA duplexes
targeting GABPA mRNA (Dharmacon) and negative nontargeting control RNA (siGenome non-targeting RNA,
Dharmacon) using Dharmafect1 reagent according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were harvested 72
hours after transfection and total RNA was extracted using
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. We assessed gene expression after GABPA
knockdown in 22 genes from 11 convergent SAGPs and
in 12 spliceosomal and proteasomal genes. To minimize
chance of cross-contamination from opposite DNA strand
in the SAGPs, we designed primers pairs for conventional
qRT-PCR outside of the regions of SA overlaps,
predominantly within the first half of a gene (5’-end)
(Supplementary file 2: Table S10B). Total RNA was used
as a template for reverse transcription using QuantiTect
Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen) using random hexamer
primers. The transcripts were analyzed by qRT-PCR run on
a Quant Studio 6 Flex System (Applied Biosystems). The
genes were relatively quantified using the dCt method[82].

Microarray analysis of the BII-OriGene cohort
Total RNA, histopathological data, tumor sample
images and clinical data from 58 BC patients were
obtained from OriGene Technologies (Rockville, MD).
Microarray analysis was performed according to the
standard Affymetrix chip protocol (Supplementary file 2:
Methods and Analyses).

Strand-specific quantitative RT-PCR
cDNA was synthesised from the total RNA (250
ng) of 42 BC patient samples purchased from OriGene
Technologies (Rockville, MD) using a gene-specific
pool of reverse primers specific for the sense/anti-sense
transcript regions. Oligoprimers were designed to fall

platform[84].
Cytoscape (version 3.2.1) was used for visualization
of GABPA gene network [86].

We estimated CNV for each gene from total
sets of 146 genes of 73-SAGPs and 146 NGNs in two
independent BC datasets. The first BC dataset included
38 BC cell lines for which both CNV and gene expression
microarray data were available [32]; the second dataset
comprised CNV data for 93 primary breast tumors [83].
Assignment SNPs to genes was performed using the
Galaxy platform [84] by first joining SNPs to the gene
intervals followed by fetching additional closest SNPs
located upstream and downstream to the gene. DNA
copy number value for each gene was estimated as an
average of CNV values for all SNPs assigned for the gene
(Supplementary file 1: Tables S4A and S4B). The analysis
revealed that 21 SAGPs in the first dataset and 5 SAGPs
in the second dataset were located in moderately or highly
amplified regions of the genome.

Transcription factor binding motifs and CBR
analyses in the proximal promoters of 73-SAGPs
and other gene sets
We analysed the proximal promoters (-450/+50
bp) for the enrichment of transcription factor binding
motifs using PSCAN software [42] in the following
sets of genes: i) 146 genes of 73-SAGPs; ii) 147 genes
identified by SAGS as significantly over-expressed in HR
BC subgroups, significantly over-represented under the
category “KEGG pathway” and related to the proteasome,
cell cycle, DNA replication, spliceosome, aminoacyltRNA biosynthesis and purine/ pyrimidine metabolism
(Supplementary file1: Tables S9B, S9C and S13, the
“KEGG genes” set). The following 3 independent negative
control sets were used: i) the set of 102 genes of PNGs
(Supplementary file 3: Figure S4, Supplementary file 2:
Methods and Analyses), ii) the set of 146 NGNs and iii)
the set of 150 DEDR genes (Supplementary file 1: Table
S9C).
To verify our in-silico predictions, we utilised the
publicly available ChIP-seq data for GABPA (MCF-7
breast cancer cells, GEO ID: GSM1010864) generated
by ENCODE (www.genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/). The
ERα ChIP-seq data for MCF-7 cells were downloaded
from GEO ID: GSE48930[85]. For each studied gene set,
we first identified higher confidence CBRs (reproducible
group) via the identification of common overlapping
significant peaks (see descriptions in GSE31477 for
GABPA) between all available ChIP-seq replicates (2
replicates for GABPA and 3 - for ERα). Then, for each set
of higher confidence CBRs taken from the first replicate
for each transcription factor, we identified the overlapping
regions of the CBRs with the proximal promoters (+50/450 bp) in each studied gene set. Genomic interval
manipulations were performed using the Galaxy
