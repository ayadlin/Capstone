The Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase 4 Has a
Pro-Oncogenic Role in Skin Cancer
Katherine G. Finegan and Cathy Tournier

Abstract
The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase 4 (MKK4) is a nonredundant component of stressactivated MAPK signaling modules. Its function in tumorigenesis remains highly controversial with some studies indicating that MKK4 is a tumor suppressor, whereas others have reported a pro-oncogenic role. To clarify
the role of MKK4 in cancer, we have created a novel mouse model to test the effect of the specific loss of
MKK4 in the epidermis on the formation of papillomas caused by activated ras mutation. We have discovered that skin-specific MKK4-deficient mice are resistant to carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis. One
mechanism by which MKK4 promotes cell proliferation and the formation of tumors is by increasing epidermal growth factor receptor expression through the c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinase/c-Jun signaling
pathway. Together, our results provide the first genetic demonstration that MKK4 is essential to mediate
the oncogenic effect of Ras in vivo, thereby validating MKK4 as a potential drug target for cancer therapy.

Introduction
Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase 4 (MKK4)
is a component of stress-activated MAPK signaling modules
(1). It can activate by phosphorylation the c-Jun NH 2 terminal protein kinase (JNK) and p38 families of MAPKs
in response to various stimuli. However, our previous studies
have provided genetic evidence that MKK4 is mostly required
for JNK activation in vivo (2), although MKK4 was shown to
contribute to p38 stimulation in cells in which both MKK3
and MKK6 have been removed (3).
JNK regulates numerous physiologic processes by controlling gene expression through the phosphorylation of components of the activator protein family of transcription factors,
including c-Jun (4). c-Jun is a critical contributor to transformation and tumorigenesis (5). The demonstration that mice
carrying a mutated allele of c-jun that cannot be phosphorylated by JNK are resistant to tumor development caused by
constitutive activation of Ras provided the first genetic link
between JNK, c-Jun, and cancer (6). However, more recently,
jnk gene disruption has been shown to enhance Rasstimulated transformation (7). In this model, JNK may
restrict tumor burden by promoting apoptosis (7). These

conflicting findings may be explained by the distinct function
of JNK isoforms with evidence that JNK1 acts as a tumor suppressor whereas JNK2 is a tumor promoter (8, 9). Moreover,
the observation that JNK1 contributes to B-cell lymphoma
caused by Bcr-Abl (10) indicates that JNKs may play different
roles depending on tumor type.
Like JNK, the role of MKK4 in cancer seems complex
with some data suggesting that MKK4 acts as a tumor and
metastasis suppressor, whereas other studies point to a prooncogenic role for MKK4 (11–14). Furthermore, understanding the requirement of MKK4 in mediating JNK signaling
downstream of oncogenes has been complicated by the existence of a second activator of JNK, MKK7 (1). Like MKK4,
MKK7 activates JNK by dual phosphorylation at Thr and
Tyr residues within the Thr-Pro-Tyr motif. However, the early
embryonic death of mice caused by the targeted deletion of
either the mkk4 or mkk7 genes indicates that MKK4 and
MKK7 have nonredundant functions in vivo (1). The inability
of MKK4 and MKK7 to compensate for each other's functions
may be due to their selective regulation by extracellular stimuli and their distinct tissue distribution (1). Overall,
conflicting findings together with the lack of understanding
of the molecular function of MKK4 downstream of oncogenes have been an obstacle for considering MKK4 as a valuable drug target for cancer therapy.
To clarify the role of MKK4 in cancer, we have examined the
effect of mkk4 gene deletion in the basal cells of the epidermis
on the development of skin tumors using the two-stage carcinogenesis protocol (15). This simple, versatile, and highly
reproducible protocol gives rise to benign papillomas with a
high incidence of ras mutation. Furthermore, in contrast to
previous studies (14), this system recapitulates the complex
interactions between tumors and host as well as the cellular
heterogeneity of tumors. This is critical considering that the

environment greatly influences the spatial and temporal regulation of signals activated by oncogenes, and consequently
determines the biological outcome of the response (16). Our
results show that skin-specific MKK4-deficient mice are resistant to tumorigenesis associated with oncogenic activation of
the ras gene. These data provide the first genetic demonstration that signaling downstream of MKK4 is essential for
tumor formation in the skin.

Materials and Methods
Genotype determination of mice and tissues
Offspring carrying the mkk4-flox allele and the K14CreERT2 transgene were identified by PCR on tail and on keratinocyte DNA, as previously described (2, 17).
Two-stage carcinogenesis
Mice were backcrossed into an FVB background. Sixweek-old littermates expressing or not expressing the
K14-CreERT2 transgene were injected i.p. every day for 5 days
with a nontoxic amount of tamoxifen (200 μg) to induce
Cre activation. Two weeks later, the shaved backs of the mice
received a single application of 25 μg of 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA) in 150 μL of acetone. One week
after DMBA, the skin of the mice was treated biweekly with
6.25 μg of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) in 150
μL of acetone for a total of 20 to 30 weeks. The tumor incidence and burden were recorded every 2 weeks for the duration of the experiment. Careful clinical examination of the
mice was carried out to allow detection of deterioration of
their physical condition associated with progression of the
tumors. Animals showing signs of distress, including ulceration of the skin, weight loss, reduced activity, and lack of
response to stimuli, were sacrificed before any further
deterioration in condition occurred.
Immunoblot analysis
Proteins were extracted from tissues in Triton lysis buffer
[20 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4), 137 mmol/L NaCl, 2 mmol/L
EDTA, 1% Triton X100, 25 mmol/L β glycerophosphate,
10% glycerol, 1 mmol/L orthovanadate, 1 mmol/L phenylsulphonyl fluoride, 10 μg/mL leupeptin, and 10 μg/mL aprotinin]. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation (14,000 g for
10 minutes* at 4°C). The concentration of soluble proteins
in the supernatants was quantified by the Bradford method
(Bio-Rad). Extracts (20 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10%
or 8% polyacrylamide gel) and electrophoretically transferred
to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Inc.). The membranes were incubated with 3% nonfat dry milk at 4°C for
30 minutes and probed overnight with antibodies (1:1,000)
to MKK4 (BD Pharmingen) or Tubulin (Sigma). Immune
complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence
with anti-mouse IgG–coupled to horseradish peroxidase as
the secondary antibody (Amersham-Pharmacia).
Histologic and immunohistochemical analyses
Freshly isolated skin biopsies and tumors were fixed at
room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde for 6 hours, de-

hydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Five-micrometer-thick
sections were cut. For histologic analysis, sections were
stained with H&E (18). For immunohistochemistry, sections
were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and treated in boiling sodium citrate buffer [10 mmol/L (pH 6.0)] for 10 minutes to unmask the antigen. Endogenous peroxidase activity was
quenched by treating the slides with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide
for 10 minutes. Sections were blocked in PBS containing 5%
to 10% goat serum and 0.1% Triton X100 for 1 hour at room
temperature before being incubated overnight at 4°C with
primary antibodies (1:100) to MKK4 (Cell Signaling), MKK7
(Cell Signaling), JNK1 (BD Pharmingen), JNK2 (Santa Cruz),
phospho-JNK (Cell Signaling), keratin 6 (K6; Covance), c-Jun
(Cell Signaling), phospho-c-Jun (Ser 73; Cell Signaling), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; Santa Cruz), and p53
(Calbiochem). The following day, the slides were rinsed in
PBS and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour with
secondary biotinylated anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, anti-goat, or
anti-sheep antibodies. The slides were processed using the
ABC detection kit (Vector Laboratories). The presence of
the antigens was revealed using the Vector SG (gray) or
diaminobenzidine (brown) peroxidase substrate kit (Vector
Laboratories) and counter stained with nuclear red or with
heamatoxylin (blue). For bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) staining, the mice were injected with 500 mg/kg BrdUrd and sacrificed 2 hours later. Immunohistochemistry was performed
using the above method, with an additional HCl treatment
for 8 minutes at 60°C before the blocking step. Mouse monoclonal antibody to BrdUrd was obtained from DAKO. For terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end
labeling (TUNEL) staining, sections were processed using the
In situ cell death detection kit, POD (Roche) according to
the manufacturer's instructions. All slides were viewed using
the Axioplan2 microscope.
Real-time quantitative PCR
Total RNA was isolated from the epidermis using the
Trizol reagent, and cDNA synthesis was carried out as previously described (19). Real-time quantitative PCRs were performed using the SYBR Green I Core kit (Eurogentec).
Sequences of the forward and reverse primers are indicated
in the Supplementary Data available with this article online
(Supplementary Fig. S1). PCR products were detected in the
ABI-PRISM 7700 sequence detection systems (Applied Biosystems). Results were analyzed using the 2−ΔΔG methods.
The level of expression of mRNA was normalized to actin
mRNA.

Results
Inactivation of MKK4 in the skin
The embryonic lethality caused by the targeted deletion of
the mkk4 gene in mice (1) led us to use the Cre-loxP system
(20) to disrupt the mkk4 gene in skin epidermis to elucidate
the function of MKK4 in cancer. Mice carrying the mkk4 gene
flanked with LoxP sites [called the flox (fl) allele; ref. 2] were
mated with a transgenic line expressing Cre fused to a mutated form of the ligand binding domain of the estrogen

receptor (CreERT2) under the control of the keratin 14 (K14)
promoter (17). Expression of K14 is restricted to proliferating
keratinocytes in the basal layer of the epidermis, where tumor induction is initiated, and is downregulated as the basal
layer differentiates. The ERT2 moiety ensures the cytoplasmic
sequestration of Cre. Cre translocates to the nucleus where it
specifically recombines the fl allele in the epidermis upon injection of the mice with tamoxifen. Multiple litters of
mkk4loxP mice were crossed with K14-CreERT2 animals. Amplification by PCR with primers specific for the mkk4 gene on
genomic DNA isolated from the skin epidermis extracted
from (K14-CreERT2)mkk4fl/fl adult mice 2 weeks after tamoxifen injection showed the specific recombination of the mkk4
gene (Fig. 1A). Immunoblot analysis of epidermal extracts of
littermates homozygous for the mkk4-flox allele confirmed
that the inactivation of the mkk4 gene in the skin only occurred in mice injected with tamoxifen and expressing Cre
(Fig. 1B). The selective ablation of mkk4 in the skin was
shown by similar expression of MKK4 in heart, brain, liver,
spleen, lung, and muscle of both mkk4 fl/fl and (K14CreERT2)mkk4fl/fl mice injected with tamoxifen (Fig. 1C). In
subsequent experiments, mkk4fl/fl and (K14-CreERT2)mkk4fl/fl
mice injected with tamoxifen will be called mkk4skin+/+ and
mkk4skin−/− animals, respectively.
Phenotypic analysis of the MKK4 mutant mice
To elucidate the function of MKK4 in skin cancer, mice
were subjected to a two-stage carcinogenesis protocol (15).
Briefly, a single dose of the carcinogen DMBA was applied
on the skin of the mice 2 weeks after the first tamoxifen injection. One week after DMBA, the skin was treated biweekly

Figure 1. Disruption of the mkk4 gene in skin epidermis. Adult mkk4fl/fl
mice carrying (+) or not carrying (−) the K14-CreERT2 transgene were
injected i.p. every day for 5 d with a nontoxic amount of tamoxifen
(200 μg) to induce Cre activation. The mice were sacrificed 2 wk later. The
epidermises of dorsal skins were separated from dermal tissues.
A, genomic DNA was isolated and amplified by PCR with primers specific
for the mkk4 gene. B and C, the specific inactivation of the mkk4 gene
in the epidermis of mice expressing Cre was confirmed by immunoblot
analyses of protein extracts obtained from various tissues using a
specific antibody to MKK4. The detection of tubulin expression was
performed to monitor protein loading. Similar results were obtained in two
independent experiments.

with the tumor promoter TPA. This protocol recapitulates
the fundamental concept that tumor development is a multistep process that includes the following: initiation of benign
papilloma (mutation of c-Ha-ras following DMBA treatment),
promotion (a clonal expansion of the initiated cell triggered
by the repeated treatment with TPA to form a benign tumor),
and progression to malignant carcinoma (an additional evolutionary step; ref. 15). Using this model, we discovered that
skin-specific MKK4-deficient mice were resistant to tumorigenesis (Fig. 2A). A control experiment indicated that oncogenic mutation of the c-H-ras gene (21) was detected in the
epidermis of both mkk4skin+/+ and mkk4skin−/− animals treated
with DMBA (data not shown). Strikingly, both tumor incidence (percentage of mice bearing one or more papillomas)
and tumor burden (number of tumors per mouse) were
greatly decreased in mice lacking MKK4 (Fig. 2B). In fact,
papillomas that did develop on the back skin of the
mkk4skin−/− mice were wild-type (Supplementary Fig. S2). This
was expected because the deletion of floxed genes following
tamoxifen-induced Cre does not occur with 100% efficiency.
The loss of MKK4 in the epidermis of adult mice did not
cause any gross morphologic defect, suggesting that MKK4 is
not required for skin homeostasis (data not shown). In contrast, DMBA/TPA treatment significantly increased the thickness of the epidermis of mkk4skin+/+, but not mkk4skin−/−,
animals reflecting an increased number of dividing wild-type
keratinocytes (Fig. 2C). We also analyzed the expression of
K6 as a marker of hyperproliferative skin and found positive
staining throughout all epidermal layers of wild-type mice
treated with DMBA/TPA (Fig. 2C). In contrast, K6 was found
in the outer root sheath of hair follicles in mkk4skin−/− animals
treated with DMBA/TPA, as in nontreated mkk4skin+/+ animals (Fig. 2C). Consistently, epidermal cell proliferation
was significantly induced by a single application of TPA on
the dorsal skin of the wild-type mice, as shown by BrdUrd
incorporation (Fig. 3A). Proliferating keratinocytes that are
normally confined to the basal layer had expanded to the suprabasal compartment (Fig. 3A). The percentage of BrdUrdlabeled wild-type cells was 2% before and 16% ± 2% 24 hours
after TPA treatment (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the proliferation
rate of MKK4-deficient keratinocytes was unchanged upon
TPA stimulation (Fig. 3A and B). Furthermore, proliferating
mutant keratinocytes were largely localized to the basal layer
as in the epidermis of nontreated wild-type mice (Fig. 3A).
Next, we determined whether the resistance of MKK4deficient mice to tumorigenesis could also be attributed to
an altered rate of cell death, expected after DNA damage
such as DMBA treatment. We found no marked difference
in the number of apoptotic cells in the basal or suprabasal
layers of the epidermis of mkk4skin+/+ and mkk4skin−/− mice
after DMBA/TPA treatment with TUNEL staining (Fig. 3C).
Together these results indicate that epidermal hyperplasia
exhibited by the wild-type skin following DMBA/TPA
treatment involved the expansion of a population of epithelial cells expressing the progenitor cell marker K6. Inhibition
of keratinocyte proliferation caused by the loss of MKK4
could explain why MKK4-deficient tumors do not form on
the back of the mkk4skin−/− mice.

biopsies 20 wk after TPA treatment shows that DMBA/TPA treatment significantly increases the thickness of the epidermis of mkk4skin+/+, but not that of
mkk4skin−/−, animals. Concomitantly, the loss of MKK4 prevents the expansion of a population of epithelial cells expressing the progenitor cell marker
K6 as shown by immunostaining with a specific antibody to K6. Scale bar, 50 μmol/L.

Mice that lack MKK4 in the skin display a defect in
JNK signaling
The role of MKK4 in regulating JNK signaling was determined by comparing sections of wild-type and MKK4deficient skin 20 weeks after DMBA/TPA treatment (Fig. 4).
Immunostaining of skin sections with an antibody to
MKK4 ascertained the absence of MKK4 in the mutant epidermis (Fig. 4). Furthermore, it showed that MKK4 expression increased in the wild-type skin exposed to DMBA/
TPA. Increased MKK4 staining was localized in the nuclear
and cytoplasmic compartment of keratinocytes present in
the upper layer of the epidermis. In contrast, the level of
the other activator of JNK, MKK7, slightly decreased in the
skin of both wild-type and mutant mice treated with
DMBA/TPA (Fig. 4). Consistently, papillomas expressed a
high level of MKK4 but a low level of MKK7 (Fig. 4). It is
interesting to note that MKK7 is expressed in the nucleus
and the cytoplasm of keratinocytes of nontreated wild-type
mice, whereas MKK4 is mostly excluded from the nuclei.
JNK1 and JNK2 have been shown to exert opposite effect
with regards to skin tumorigenesis with evidence that JNK1

5800

acts as a tumor suppressor, whereas JNK2 is a tumor promoter (8, 9). Immunostaining of skin sections with antibodies specific to JNK1 or JNK2 showed that the level of JNK1
decreased, whereas that of JNK2 increased, in wild-type skin
treated with DMBA/TPA (Fig. 4). Increased accumulation of
nuclear and cytosolic JNK2 was observed throughout the
wild-type epidermis. These changes were dependent on the
presence of MKK4 because the level of expression of JNK1
and JNK2 was similar in mkk4skin−/− animals treated with
DMBA/TPA (Fig. 4). Sections of skin biopsies were immunostained with a specific antibody to phospho (P)-JNK to determine the requirement of MKK4 in regulating JNK activity
(Fig. 4). We found that DMBA/TPA treatment increased the
phosphorylation of JNK. Similar to JNK2, P-JNK accumulated
in the nuclear and cytosolic compartment of keratinocytes
throughout the treated wild-type epidermis. This was prevented by the loss of MKK4 (Fig. 4).
Consistent with the requirement of JNK to stimulate the
transcriptional activity of c-Jun (4), the loss of MKK4
resulted in impaired phosphorylation of c-Jun at Ser73
(Fig. 5). c-Jun increases the transcription of numerous genes,

one of which is the c-jun gene itself (22). This autoregulation
of the c-jun promoter by c-Jun explains why increased c-Jun
protein level caused by DMBA/TPA treatment of wild-type
skin was prevented in the epidermis of mice lacking MKK4
(Fig. 5). Both the phosphorylation and expression of c-Jun
accumulated in cells localized to the edge of the upper layer
of the wild-type epidermis (Fig. 5). Increased phosphorylation of c-Jun was also detected in proliferating cells surrounding the hair follicle. Taken together, these results led
us to conclude that MKK4 is a critical activator of JNK signaling in the skin.
Identification of target genes downstream of MKK4
To shed light into the molecular mechanism by which
MKK4/JNK/c-Jun promotes tumorigenesis, we examined
the effect of the loss of MKK4 on EGFR, a known target
of c-Jun and an essential contributor of skin tumorigenesis
(23). We found that MKK4 was required for increased EGFR
expression in the skin of animals treated with DMBA/TPA
(Fig. 5). Increased level of EGFR was observed in the cytoplasmic membrane of keratinocytes present in the wild-type
epidermis of treated mice. Consequently, the requirement of

MKK4 to increase EGFR expression through c-Jun constitutes one mechanism by which MKK4 initiates the formation
of tumors downstream of Ras. Additionally, skin biopsies
were immunostained with a specific antibody to p53 because p53 is a tumor suppressor whose transcription can
be repressed by JNK signaling (Fig. 5; refs. 24, 25). We find
that the treatment of wild-type mice with DMBA/TPA reduced the expression of p53 in the epidermis. In contrast,
the level of p53 in MKK4-deficient keratinocytes remained
high, particularly in cells localized at the edge of the upper
layer of the epidermis, indicating that MKK4 is required to
prevent increased p53 expression following oncogenic Ras
activation (Fig. 5).
The changes observed using immunohistochemistry were
confirmed by real-time PCR experiments (Fig. 6). The result
showed a significant increase of mkk4 which correlated with
elevated level of jnk2, c-Jun, and egfr transcripts in treated
compared with nontreated wild-type skin. In contrast,
DMBA/TPA treatment decreased the amount of jnk1 and
p53 mRNA. These regulations were abolished in the absence
of MKK4. Furthermore, the loss of MKK4 caused a relatively
moderate but statistically significant (P < 0.05, paired t test)

shows that the number of proliferating cells is higher in the epidermis of mkk4skin+/+ compared with that of mkk4skin−/− animals treated with TPA.

animals were treated with DMBA/TPA. Controls correspond to age-matched nontreated mkk4skin+/+ mice. Skin biopsies and tumors were isolated 20 wk
later. Sections were immunostained with the antibodies indicated. Immunostaining with a specific antibody to MKK4 confirms the loss of MKK4 in the
epidermis of mkk4fl/fl mice expressing the K14-CreERT2 transgene and treated with tamoxifen. The absence of MKK4 prevents increased JNK2 expression
following DMBA/TPA treatment. In contrast, the level of JNK1 is reduced in the wild-type skin treated with DMBA/TPA. Immunostaining with a specific
antibody to phospho (P)-JNK shows that DMBA/TPA induces the phosphorylation of JNK and that this is prevented by the loss of MKK4. Unless indicated

decrease in the normal level of c-jun and egfr (Fig. 6), suggesting that MKK4 is also required for c-Jun and EGFR protein
expression under basal conditions. This agrees with the low
level of c-Jun and EGFR detected in mkk4−/− skin treated with
DMBA/TPA (Fig. 5). In addition, mkk4−/− skin displayed a
high level of p53, which was greatly increased upon stimulation (Fig. 6). This result supports the immunohistochemical
evidence that MKK4 is required to downregulate p53 expression under both basal and stimulated conditions (Fig. 5). The

amount of mkk7 and jnk1 was also significantly increased
following the loss of MKK4 (Fig. 6). However, this was not
reflected in protein levels (Fig. 4).

Discussion
Our results show that MKK4 has a pro-oncogenic function
in the skin. This contrasts with previous studies that have
supported a role for MKK4 as a tumor suppressor (14). These

MKK4-Deficient Mice Are Resistant to Tumorigenesis

previous conclusions were based on the identification of the
functional loss of MKK4 in a small percentage (approximately
3–5%) of human cancer cell lines derived from tumors of
various origins including, pancreas, lung, breast, colon, prostate, ovary, and testis (14, 26). In addition, a reduction in the
level of expression of MKK4 was observed in prostate and
ovarian metastatic tissues, compared with normal prostate
and ovarian epithelial cells, thereby suggesting that MKK4
has a metastatic suppressive role (27–29). This was further
supported by evidence that prostate and ovarian cancer cell
lines displaying a low level of MKK4 exhibited increased metastatic potential (27, 29). Consistently, a link between the
loss of MKK4 and the more advanced stages of cancer progression was shown by the clinical finding that the lack of
expression of MKK4 in pancreatic cancer correlated with
shorter survival times (30). However, the demonstration that
mice injected with the pancreatic cancer cell line PL5 featuring the targeted disruption of the mkk4 gene had very few
lung metastases compared with those injected with the parental or mkk4+/− cells provided a contrasting view (13). It
was also reported that the ectopic expression of MKK4 in
breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines lacking endogenous
MKK4 stimulated cell proliferation and invasion (12). A

pro-oncogenic function of MKK4 has been further supported
by the analysis of gastric cancers and laryngeal squamous
cell carcinomas. Patients with MKK4 present in tumor tissues had a significantly shorter survival compared with patients with reduced MKK4 expression (31, 32). Overall, the
inconsistent findings of these studies may reflect the contextdependent complexity of MKK4 signaling and illustrate the
difficulty to draw conclusions from the analysis of human
cancers considering their heterogeneity, even within a given
tissue, in terms of genetic background and histologic subtype. A more precise understanding of the role of MKK4 in
cancer will be acquired from studies such as ours, based on a
cancer model that occurs in situ in mice in which these
variables can be controlled. This knowledge will lead to novel
ideas and hypotheses that can be further tested in the human
population for logical consistency.
The mechanism by which MKK4 promotes tumorigenesis
in the skin seems to be mediated through JNK. This is based
on evidence that the targeted deletion of the mkk4 gene in
the skin prevents increased JNK phosphorylation following
DMBA/TPA treatment. This defect does not affect the rate
of cell death in contrast to expectations as one major function of the JNK signaling pathway is to promote apoptosis

treated with DMBA/TPA. Controls correspond to age-matched nontreated mkk4skin+/+ mice. Sections of skin biopsies and tumors 20 wk after
treatment were immunostained with antibodies to c-Jun, phospho (P)-c-Jun at Ser 73, EGFR, and p53. The results show that MKK4 is required for
increased expression and phosphorylation of c-Jun, and increased expression of the c-Jun target EGFR. Elevated expression of p53 in MKK4-deficient
epidermis of animals treated with DMBA/TPA is consistent with evidence that p53 is a tumor suppressor whose transcription can be repressed by
JNK signaling. Scale bar, 20 μmol/L.

(33). The physiologic significance of this result in cancer biology was provided by a study showing that JNK deficiency
decreases the rate of apoptosis associated with Ras-stimulated
transformation, thereby promoting the formation of lung
tumors in a model of tumor metastasis (7). However, other
studies have suggested an essential role for JNK in tumor
development (34). In particular, JNK has been shown to potentiate B-cell lymphomas caused by Bcr-Abl and to accelerate tumorigenesis in a model of colorectal carcinogenesis
(10, 35). The requirement of JNK for the survival of transformed B lymphoblasts is likely to contribute to BCR-Abl–
induced cell transformation (10), whereas tumor cell proliferation was significantly increased by augmented JNK
signaling in the gut (35). Overall, the ability of JNK to promote apoptosis, survival, or proliferation depending on the
tissue origin of the tumor provides an explanation into the
context-dependent complexity of the function of MKK4 signaling in cancers.
Consistent with the demonstration that JNK1 acts as a
suppressor, and that JNK2 is a promoter of skin tumor
(8, 9), we found that expression of JNK2 is induced, whereas
that of JNK1 is decreased, in wild-type skin treated
with DMBA/TPA. Gene expression arrays using jnk1−/− and
jnk2−/− mouse embryonic cells were performed in an attempt
to uncover the molecular events that distinguish the functions

of JNK isoforms in vivo (36). In agreement with their opposing
functions in skin tumor development, the loss of JNK1 enhanced the expression of antiapoptotic genes, whereas cells
lacking JNK2 display increased expression of genes related
to tumor suppression and induction of cell differentiation,
apoptosis, or cell growth. However, the mechanism underlying
the specificity of the transcriptional regulation networks
downstream of JNK1 and JNK2 is not understood because
thus far, there is no evidence that JNK1 and JNK2 can regulate
by phosphorylation different sets of transcription factors. Indeed, one study showed that, in contrast to JNK1, JNK2 is a
negative regulator of c-Jun function (37). However, this conclusion has since been challenged by evidence that chemical
inhibition of JNK2 in cells lacking JNK1 potently inhibited
c-Jun phosphorylation (38). Jaeschke and colleagues (38)
proposed that increased expression of c-Jun in jnk2−/− cells,
which has led to the conclusion that JNK2 is a negative regulator of c-Jun (37), may be a consequence of compensatory
adaptations in jnk2 −/− cells that include increased JNK1
expression. In our system, we discovered that reduced JNK2 expression caused by the loss of MKK4 correlated with decreased
expression and phosphorylation of c-Jun. The inability of JNK1
to compensate for a defective JNK2 in mkk4skin−/− animals can
be explained by the observation that DMBA/TPA treatment
inhibits JNK1 expression.

MKK4-Deficient Mice Are Resistant to Tumorigenesis

The significance of impaired c-Jun phosphorylation in the
epidermis lacking MKK4 is shown by altered expression of
EGFR, a known target of c-Jun (39). Genetic studies have provided evidence that a functional c-Jun/EGFR pathway is required for skin tumor formation induced by expression of the
K5-SOS-F transgene (23). The ability of EGFR to prevent cell
differentiation, thereby maintaining keratinocytes in a proliferative state, is one mechanism by which c-Jun contributes to
tumor formation upon Ras activation (23). This is consistent
with the demonstration that c-Jun is not essential in vivo for
the proliferation of keratinocytes under both normal and
stress conditions (23). This contrasts with the proliferative
defect displayed by the mkk4 −/− epidermis treated with
TPA. Therefore, although increased expression of EGFR expression through c-Jun is important, it is unlikely to be the
only mechanism by which MKK4 promotes cell proliferation
and initiates the formation of tumors downstream of Ras.
This is further supported by the evidence that the phenotypic
defect displayed by the loss of MKK4 in skin tumor development is more severe than that caused by the deletion of c-jun
(23). Decreased p53 stability through JNK (25) may be the
other important regulatory mechanism implicated in mediating the pro-oncogenic effect of MKK4 independently of c-Jun.
This is shown by our finding that both treated and nontreated MKK4-deficient epidermises display a high level
of p53. In addition, this result led to the hypothesis that
MKK4 may be involved in malignancy by downregulating
p53. This model is supported by evidence that the loss of

p53 enhances malignant progression of chemically induced
skin tumors (40). Together, these observations highlight the
need for future studies aimed at determining the role of
MKK4 in the malignant progression of skin tumors. This
work will be crucial for further validating MKK4 as a valuable
drug target for cancer therapy.
