BACKGROUND. Urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) expression has been shown to correlate
with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC). The authors hypothesized that targeting uPAR, a receptor involved in cell proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, and angiogenesis, would impair the
growth of CRC in the liver, the most common site of metastasis. METHODS. Human CRC cell lines were
examined for uPAR expression by Western blot analysis. The in vitro effects of the uPAR monoclonal antibody (MoAb) (ATN-658) were tested in proliferation and migration assays. For in vivo studies, human
HCT116 CRC cells were injected directly into the livers of mice in 2 separate studies, the first to determine
the effect of therapy with ATN-658 on small-volume disease (therapy begun on Day 4), and a second study
to determine the effect of therapy on established disease (therapy begun on Day 12). Mice were randomized to receive either nonspecific immunoglobulin G MoAb (control) or ATN-658, and were sacrificed 1
month after tumor implantation. RESULTS. uPAR was expressed by all CRC cell lines studied. In vitro, ATN658 had minimal effect on CRC proliferation in monolayers, but significantly decreased CRC cell migration.
In vivo, ATN-658 lead to significant reductions in tumor growth versus control when initiated either 4 or 12
days after tumor implantation (65% vs control [P  .05] and 85% vs control [P  .05]). ATN-658 significantly inhibited in vivo tumor cell proliferation in both studies. CONCLUSIONS. uPAR MoAb therapy
impaired CRC tumor growth in the liver in both small-volume and large-volume disease models. Cancer

Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United
States, with approximately 55,000 deaths each year.1 The current first-line therapy for metastatic CRC
(mCRC), including the combination of chemotherapy with monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to vascular
endothelial growth factor or the epidermal growth factor receptor, leads to median survival of <2 years.2,3

Anti-uPAR therapy in CRC/Van Buren et al

New strategies to improve our systemic regimens for
mCRC are necessary to further improve outcomes for this
disease.
The urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) ligand
and uPA receptor (uPAR) system mediate tumor cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, and invasion.4-8 uPAR is a
multifunctional cell surface glycosyl phosphatidylinositol–
linked protein that engages in numerous protein-protein
interactions, and is an important facilitator of the proteolytic cascade involved in tumor invasion and tissue remodeling.8 uPA/uPAR expression has been shown to correlate
with poor prognosis in various malignancies,9-11 including
CRC,12-17 inw which where uPAR is overexpressed.7,15,18
uPA and uPAR are involved in CRC cell migration and
invasion,7,18 and antibodies or antisense to uPAR decreases
invasion and metastasis.8,19,20 The unique characteristics
of the uPAR system make this receptor a potential target
for the development of therapies for mCRC. We hypothesized that targeting uPAR will impair CRC growth in 2
distinct phases of tumor growth in the murine liver.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents
MoAbs to human uPAR (ATN-658) and nonspecific
MoAbs were provided by Attenuon, LLC (San Diego,
Calif). ATN-658 is a novel human uPAR-specific MoAb
that does not inhibit the binding of uPA to uPAR; thus it
can bind to uPAR regardless of whether it is occupied by
uPA. In addition, ATN-658 can bind to the residual fragment of uPAR frequently observed in tumors that remains
attached to the membrane after proteolysis.
Antibodies used for immunohistochemical (IHC)
and Western blot analyses were as follows: antibromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and anti-CD105 antibody (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif); anti–proliferating cell nuclear
antigen (PCNA) PC-10 (DAKO, Carpentaria, Calif);
anti-uPAR (American Diagnostica Inc., Stamford,
Conn); and cleaved caspase-3 (BioCare Medical LLC,
Concord, Calif).
Cell Lines and Cell Culture Conditions
The human CRC cell lines HCT116, GEO, HT29,
RKO, and SW480 were obtained from American Type
Cancer

July 15, 2009

Culture Collection (Manassas, Va). KM12 was the kind
gift of I.J. Fidler, DVM, PhD, of the University of Texas
M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Cells were cultured and
maintained in minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 U/mL
of a penicillin-streptomycin mixture (Flow Laboratories,
Rockville, Md), vitamins (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand
Island, NY), 1 mmol/L of sodium pyruvate, 2 mmol/L of
L-glutamine, and nonessential amino acids and incubated
in 5% carbon dioxide of 95% air at 37 C. In vitro experiments were performed when cells were at 50% to 70%
confluence.

Immunoprecipitation and Western
Blot Analysis
Whole-cell protein was isolated from CRC cells at 70% to
80% confluence by using RIPA ‘‘B’’ protein lysis buffer as
previously described.21 The isolated protein was quantified by a commercially available modified Bradford assay
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, Calif). Cell extracts (in
a Triton X-100 buffer with protease inhibitors) were
immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-uPAR antibody. The RKO cell line served as the positive control for
uPAR.22 The immunoprecipitated material was subjected
to Western blot analysis, and the blot was probed with 5
lg/mL of an anti-uPAR MoAb generated against domain
1 of the protein (American Diagnostica, Greenwich,
Conn) and a horseradish peroxidase–conjugated goat
antimouse immunoglobulin (Ig) G. Protein bands were
observed by using a commercially available enhanced
chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences, Fairfield,
Conn).

Transwell Migration and Invasion Assays
To assess cell migration in vitro, HCT116, RKO, and
SW480 cells (1  105 cells in 500 lL MEM supplemented with 1% FBS) were placed in the top chamber of
transwell migration chambers (8 lm BioCoat Control
Inserts, Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford, Mass).
GEO, HT29, and KM12 cells were not included, because
they migrate poorly in in vitro assays. The lower chamber
was filled with 750 lL MEM supplemented with 10%
FBS plus either nonspecific MoAb (50 lg/mL) or ATN658 (50 lg/mL). After either 24 or 48 hours, unmigrated
3361

Original Article

cells were removed from the upper surface of the transwell
membrane with a cotton swab, and migrated cells on the
lower membrane surface were fixed, stained, photographed, and counted under high-power magnification
(100). HCT116 cells were examined at 24 hours
because of rapid migration, and RKO and SW480 cells
were examined at 48 hours. Three wells were studied per
group, and photographs were taken from 3 random fields
of each well.

Cell Counts
The growth rate of HCT116, HT29, RKO, and SW480
cells in the presence of nonspecific MoAb or ATN-658
was evaluated with a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as follows.
Cells (3  103) were plated in 96-well plates in MEM
with 10% FBS overnight, and the medium was changed
the next morning to fresh MEM with 10% FBS with either nonspecific MoAb (50 lg/mL) or ATN-658 (50 lg/
mL). All assays were performed in 10 wells per cell line.
After 24 hours and 48 hours, 2 mg/mL MTT (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, Mo) in PBS was added (50 lL/well),
and plates were incubated at 37 C for 2 hours. At that
time, the medium and MTT were removed, dimethyl
sulfoxide was added for 10 minutes, and absorbance was
measured at 570 nm.

Orthotopic Tumor Model
Six-week-old male nude mice were purchased from the
Animal Production Program of the National Cancer
Institute’s Frederick Cancer Research and Development
Center (Frederick, Md) and housed and maintained in accordance with the standards of the University of Texas M.
D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee.
HCT116 cells were grown to 80% confluence and
trypsinized, and >90% cell viability was confirmed by
trypan blue exclusion. Briefly, after anesthesia was
induced with ketamine (Sigma, 30 mg/kg intraperitoneally [ip]), an upper midline abdominal incision was created. The left upper liver lobe was isolated, and 1  106
cells/ 50 lL/mouse were injected beneath the liver capsule. After the injection, pressure was held at the injection
3362

site with a sterile cotton swab dipped in ethanol. The
wound was closed with staples.
Two separate studies were done to determine the
effect of ATN-658 on 1) small-volume disease (therapy
begun on Day 4), and 2) established disease (therapy
begun on Day 12).
In Study 1, mice were randomly assigned to 1 of 2
groups of 10 and treated with equal-volume ip injections
of either nonspecific IgG (10 mg/kg) or ATN-658 (10
mg/kg). Therapy was initiated on Day 4. Antibodies were
administered ip twice per week, and treatment was continued until the mice were sacrificed on Day 28.
In Study 2, mice were randomly assigned to 1 of 2
groups of 12 and treated with equal-volume ip injections
of either nonspecific IgG (10 mg/kg) or ATN-658 (10
mg/kg). HCT-116 cells were inoculated and allowed to
grow for 11 days before initiating treatment. One mouse
died during anesthesia induction before injection.
Tumors removed after euthanasia on Day 11 from a satellite group of mice (n ¼ 3) had a mean tumor volume of
approximately 450 mm3. Treatments were initiated the
next day (Day 12) in the remaining mice (n ¼ 10 per
group). Subsequently, antibodies were given ip twice per
week, and treatment was continued until the mice were
sacrificed on Day 29.
On the day of sacrifice, mice were injected ip with
0.2 mL (50 mg/mL) BrdU (Upstate, Temecula, Calif) 4
hours before being euthanized to assess tumor cell proliferation. Mice were anesthetized by carbon dioxide. Mouse
tumors and livers were excised, weighed, and measured.
Tumors were measured with calipers, and tumor volumes
(in cubic millimeters) were calculated as (length  0.5) 
width2. A portion of each tumor was placed in 10% formalin (for paraffin embedding), snap-frozen, and placed
in Optimal Cutting Temperature solution (Miles Laboratories/Bayer AG, Elkhart, Ind) in preparation for subsequent IHC analyses. The combined liver and tumor
weights were collected and normalized to mouse body
weights. The tumor volumes for each group were
averaged.

Tissue Staining and Immunohistochemistry
Optimum cutting temperature solution (OCT)-embedded liver tissue specimens were fixed in cold acetate for 5
min, acetateþchloroform (1:1) for 5 min, and fresh cold

acetate for another 5 min, and IHC staining for BrdU,
PCNA, or caspase-3 was performed as previously
described.23 The number of BrdU-positive cells, PCNApositive cells, or caspase-3–positive cells were counted in 7
random fields from 5 different tumor specimens per
group (magnification, 100).
Tumor microvascular counts and tumor vessel area
were analyzed by IHC. Because the sinusoidal vascular
architecture of the liver makes obtaining accurate blood vessel counts difficult, we stained livers for CD105, a marker
of activated endothelium, to macroscopically assess the relative levels of activated endothelium among different groups.
Slides were fixed in acetone, then endogenous peroxidases
were blocked with H2O2 in methanol. After antigen retrieval in ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, slides were
blocked with protein-blocking agent for 20 minutes. Then
the primary CD105 antibody was added in a 1:100 concentration overnight at 4 C. After a second protein blockade,
specimens were incubated with horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated secondary antibody for 30 minutes at room
temperature. Slides were observed in the standard fashion.
An investigator blinded to treatment group assignment visually compared stained tumors from the various groups.
To evaluate apoptosis, in addition to the caspase-3,
the terminal deoxynucleotide transferase–mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay
was performed with a commercial kit (Promega, Madison, Wis) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and
counterstained with the DNA-specific dye Hoechst
33,345 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Ore). The number of
TUNEL-stained cells per high-power field was counted in
5 fields per tumor. Fluorescently labeled cells were examined using a Nikon Microphot-FXA fluorescent microscope, and representative images were recorded.

Transwell migration assays were done to evaluate
the effect of anti-uPAR therapy on HCT116, RKO, and
SW480 cell migration. HCT116 cells were examined at
24 hours, and RKO and SW480 cells were examined at
48 hours. Treatment of cells with ATN-658 led to
an approximately 50% inhibition of migration in
HCT116 cells, 90% reduction in RKO cells, and 35%
reduction in SW480 cells relative to control (P < .0001;
P < .0001; P < .01 vs nonspecific IgG MoAb, respectively) (Fig. 1B).

To evaluate the effect of ATN-658 on tumor cell apoptosis in vivo, tumor sections were stained for TUNELpositive cells and caspase-3–positive cells. There was no

uPAR has been shown to mediate angiogenesis via

Original Article

Because the ATN-658 recognizes only uPAR and not murine uPAR, any changes in angiogenesis would be because
of an upstream effect on human tumor cells. CD105
staining was done on tumors from the early therapy
group, and there was no difference in vessel counts or vessel morphology between the 2 groups (data not shown).
Effect of uPAR MoAb tumor morphology

Light microscopic analysis of H&E-stained sections
of the HCT116 tumor xenograft specimens from both
the early and late experiment were examined. In both
experiments, anti-uPAR therapy did not induce any discernable changes in regard to tumor morphology (data
not shown).

DISCUSSION
uPAR expression has been shown to correlate with poor
prognosis in CRC.12-14,16,17,26 uPAR’s primary role in
proteolysis, cell migration, growth control, and tumor cell
dormancy make it an important mediator of CRC progression and metastasis.4,7,18,22 We have previously demonstrated that ATN-658 significantly inhibited pancreatic
cancer growth, invasion, and metastasis in an orthotopic
xenograft model.5 On the basis of uPAR’s role in CRC
progression, we sought to investigate uPAR as a target in
CRC in the liver.
In the first portion of our study, we established that
our target uPAR was present in CRC cell lines. Next we
assessed the effect of ATN-658 in vitro. The results indicating that ATN-658 inhibited cellular migration and
invasion were consistent with what has been shown with
uPAR inhibition in CRC and other cell lines in vitro.5,18
Although uPAR has been shown to affect proliferation in
some tumor cell lines,27 we found that ATN-658 had
only minimal effects on tumor cell proliferation in our
CRC cells in vitro. This effect on proliferation in vitro
was relatively small (0% to 12%) in comparison to the
large decrease in proliferation observed in vivo (55% to
90%). This discrepancy is difficult to explain. Of course,
in vitro conditions do not mirror the tumor microenvironment in vivo. Although uPAR may inhibit tumor
angiogenesis indirectly by down-regulation of tumor cell–
derived angiogenic factors, the decrease in tumor cell proliferation observed in vivo was independent of changes
in angiogenesis (vessel count). Our in vitro studies were
3366

performed in monolayer cultures, and these 2-dimensional studies clearly do not reflect the complexities of the
tumor microenvironment. Because ATN-658 does not
recognize murine uPAR, effects of ATN-658 cannot
directly alter the tumor microenvironment. However, it is
possible that ATN-658 can alter secretion of factors from
tumor cells that can alter the extracellular matrix. Inhibition of tumor cell migration by ATN-658 was the most
marked finding in vitro. We hypothesize that the decrease
in tumor cell proliferation observed in vivo is a combination of a small direct effect on tumor cells as well as an
indirect effect by ATN-658 on the interaction between
the tumor cell and the extracellular matrix.
ATN-658 significantly decreased tumor growth in
both small-volume and large-volume disease in the liver.
In CRC, uPAR’s role in tumor growth is currently being
elucidated.4,22 In addition, uPAR’s biologic cross-talk
with other tyrosine kinase systems such as the HGF/cMET axis has been shown to play a large role in hepatocellular carcinoma invasion and spread in the liver.28 On the
basis of uPAR’s role in mediating tumor cell growth5,27
and uPAR’s role in the liver microenvironment,28 we
wanted to assess the affects of targeting uPAR in both
small-volume and large-volume colon cancer growth in
the liver. We chose the direct liver injection model to
study CRC tumor growth in the liver, because this produces a single liver mass that can be easily measured. This
model allows us to directly assess CRC tumor growth in
the liver, and has been well described in other publications.29-31 This model avoids the problems that tend to
arise in mCRC models to the liver, such as splenic injections that may have inconsistent tumor take in the liver,
ectopic metastasis at the injection sites, and the challenge
of quantifying the number of metastases versus growth of
individual metastasis. We focused on HCT-116 cells
because this cell line produces consistent results when
injected in the livers of nude mice.
As in most preclinical studies evaluating therapeutic
agents, we initially targeted mCRC in small-volume disease. After we found efficacy at this stage of tumor growth,
we subsequently tested our agent in large-volume disease
and found similar efficacy. The findings that ATN-658
impaired tumor cell proliferation, but not apoptosis or
angiogenesis, suggest that uPAR potentially plays a role in
the tumor cell cycle. These results provide a rationale for
targeting uPAR for CRC growing in the liver.

Anti-uPAR therapy in CRC/Van Buren et al

Despite improvements with current first-line therapy for mCRC, the median overall survival for patients
with mCRC is approximately 20 months, and thus new
targeted therapeutics are necessary to further improve
treatment options in the field. The results of the current
study demonstrate the importance of uPAR in CRC tumor growth and supports further study of uPAR as a therapeutic target for the treatment of CRC.
