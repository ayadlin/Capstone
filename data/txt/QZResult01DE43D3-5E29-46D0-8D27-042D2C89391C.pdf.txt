BACKGROUND: In this study, the authors evaluated whether a pathologic complete response (pCR) or a clinical complete response (cCR) to neoadjuvant treatment in patients with locally advanced breast cancer differed among the 3
subtypes of breast cancer: triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)positive breast cancer, and hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer. Whether a cCR or a pCR was
correlated with fewer recurrences and better survival also was investigated. METHODS: Patients with stage II/III
breast cancer received 4 cycles of neoadjuvant docetaxel and carboplatin (TC) every 3 weeks. Patients with
HER2-positive tumors were randomized to receive either additional weekly trastuzumab preoperatively or TC
alone. Postoperatively, all patients received 4 cycles of TC, and all HER2-positive patients received a total of 52
weeks of trastuzumab. The recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates at 2 years were reported.
RESULTS: Seventy-four patients were enrolled, including 11 patients with TNBC, 30 patients with HER2-positive
tumors, and 33 patients with hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative tumor. The cCR rates were 45.4%, 50% and
40.6% in TNBC, HER2-positive, and hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative groups, respectively. The pCR rate for
the entire group was 26.8%, and patients with TNBC had the best response (54.6%) followed by patients with HER2positive tumors (24.1%) and patients with hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative tumors (19.4%; P ¼ .0126). The
pCR rate for patients with HER2-positive tumors improved from 7% to 40% if trastuzumab was added (P ¼ .08). Infiltrating ductal cancer, TNBC, negative estrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor status, tumor classification
predicted a pCR (P  .05). Multivariate analysis using a logistic regression test indicated that tumor type was an independent predictor. The RFS rate for patients who did versus patients who did not achieve a pCR was 93.8% versus
78.4% at 2 years, respectively, and 83.3% versus 58% at 3 years, respectively (P ¼ .1227); whereas, for patients who
did versus patients who did not achieve a cCR, the RFS rate was 80.9% versus 83.9%, respectively, at 2 years and
65% versus 64.3%, respectively, at 3 years (P ¼ .999). CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that the TC combination is promising for the treatment of TNBC. The addition of trastuzumab to TC improved the pCR rate signifiC 2010 American Cancer Society.

Prospective, randomized clinical trials repeatedly have demonstrated a significant survival advantage from postop-

erative adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with breast cancer.1,2 However, patients with locoregionally advanced breast
cancer frequently receive neoadjuvant (preoperative) chemotherapy as a first-line treatment. The survival outcome
achieved with neoadjuvant chemotherapy reportedly was at least equivalent to3-5 or better than the outcome achieved with
conventional postoperative chemotherapy.6 Although the survival benefit of neoadjuvant versus postoperative systemic
treatment is yet to be defined, it has been demonstrated clearly that neoadjuvant chemotherapy can downstage tumors to

facilitate breast-conservation surgery6-8 in some patients
and can improve resectability in others. Most important,
patients who achieve a pathologic complete response
(pCR)3,8-11 have better long-term survival than patients
who achieve a lesser response. Not only is response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy clinically important, it also provides a research opportunity to study the molecular basis
of differential tumor responses.
Because of the heterogeneous nature of breast cancer, clinical outcomes with the same treatment vary widely
even among patients with breast cancer of identical stage
and histology. In recent years, gene expression studies
have identified 5 subtypes of breast cancer: luminal A,
luminal B, basal-like, normal-like, and human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 (erbB2 or HER2)-positive,12-14
all of which have distinct clinical outcomes and require
different treatment considerations. In the current study,
we investigated tumor responses to a neoadjuvant regimen
consisting of docetaxel and carboplatin (TC) with trastuzumab (TCH) or without trastuzumab in patients with
stage II/III breast cancer.
Because of the association of serious cardiotoxicities
and leukemia with anthracyclines,15 nonanthracyclinebased chemotherapeutic agents have been evaluated for
their roles in the treatment of breast cancer. Taxanes have
emerged as the most effective alternative to doxorubicin.
Docetaxel had activity in both anthracycline-sensitive and
anthracycline-resistant patients16-19 and was at least as
effective as doxorubicin in a randomized phase 3 study.20
In addition, 6 major prospective, randomized clinical trials that included at least 1000 patients in each trial also
demonstrated the superior efficacy of taxanes compared
with anthracycline-based regimens.21-26 In the US Oncology 9735 study,26 1016 patients with lymph node-positive breast cancer and high-risk, lymph node-negative
breast cancer were randomized to receive 4 cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) (doxorubicin 60
mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2) or TC (docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2). After a median follow-up of 66 months, the results indicated
that TC was superior to AC in terms of both disease-free
survival (86% vs 80%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.67) and overall survival (OS) (90% vs 87%; HR, 0.76). At 7 years, the
TC group had a statistically better disease-free survival
rate compared with the AC group (81% vs 75%) and a
better OS rate (87% vs 82%). The incidence of febrile
neutropenia was higher in the TC group, whereas nausea
and vomiting were more severe in the AC group. A docetaxel-based regimen without doxorubicin also demon-

strated efficacy in patients with HER2-positive cancer. In
the Breast Cancer International Research Group 006
study,27 patients with HER2-positive disease were
randomized into 3 groups: 4 cycles of AC followed by
docetaxel, 4 cycles of AC followed by trastuzumab and
docetaxel, or 6 cycles of TCH. After 4 years, patients who
received trastuzumab in addition to chemotherapy had
better disease-free survival than patients who received AC
alone. There was no significant therapeutic difference
between the doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, docetaxel,
and trastuzumab (ACTH) group and the TCH group
among patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. The 4year disease-free survival rates were 83%, 82%, and 77%
for the ACTH, TCH, and AC groups, respectively.27
Taken together, docetaxel was effective in all subgroups of
patients with breast cancer who had different hormone receptor status and HER2 status. Thus, docetaxel was
selected in our study as part of the neoadjuvant regimen
for the treatment of patients with large, nonmetastatic
breast cancer.
In considering another drug, we chose carboplatin
as the second agent. Preclinical studies indicated that,
when given together with trastuzumab, platinum salts had
a synergistic antitumor effect both in vitro and
in vivo.28,29 Platinum salts, when used as third-line treatment, demonstrated a response rate of only 10%. However, when platinum salts were combined with other
drugs and used as first-line treatment, the response rates
were as high as 50%. It was demonstrated that platinum
caused interstrand DNA cross-linking, which cannot be
repaired effectively in triple-negative breast cancer
(TNBC) associated with mutation of the breast cancer 1
gene BRCA1. Therefore, TC with or without trastuzumab
was chosen for patients with large primary breast cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Between 2002 and 2007, 74 patients who had a tissueproven diagnosis of T2, T3, or T4 breast carcinoma with
any lymph node status and without distant metastasis
were enrolled onto an institutional review boardapproved neoadjuvant study evaluating tumor response
induced by TC in patients with HER2-negative breast
cancer and TC with or without trastuzumab in HER2positive cancer. Baseline estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) status determined by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining and HER2 status
determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)

were required for all patients. Patients who had a previous
cancer diagnosis or who had received any of the study
drugs in the past were excluded.
All patients were required to have breast examinations and mammography for tumor assessment before
and after neoadjuvant treatment. Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies were optional when tumor
size assessed by both modalities was similar and were
required if the findings were discordant. Baseline positron
emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography
scans and bone scans were required. Tumor tissues at
baseline and at definitive surgery after neoadjuvant treatment were collected for molecular analysis of drug
susceptibility.
Treatment
Docetaxel (75 mg/m2) and carboplatin (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ¼ 6) were administered every 3 weeks for 4 cycles both before and after
definitive surgery in all patients. Patients who had HER2amplified tumors were randomized to receive neoadjuvant
chemotherapy alone (15 patients) and chemotherapy plus
weekly trastuzumab (4 mg/kg followed by 2 mg/kg; 15
patients) before surgery. Patients with HER2-positive disease who were randomized to receive preoperative chemotherapy alone received a total of 52 weeks of trastuzumab
postoperatively, and patients who were randomized to
receive neoadjuvant TCH received trastuzumab both preoperatively and postoperatively for a total 52 weeks of
trastuzumab. The trastuzumab dosing was changed from
weekly to every 3 weeks (6 mg/kg) once chemotherapy
was complete.
Tumor Response
Clinical responses were rated according to the Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors.30 Clinical tumor
size was assessed in 2-dimensional measurement by 1)
physical examination, 2) mammography, and 3) MRI. In
patients with inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), when a
dominant mass was not present, the area of diffuse swelling and skin change was measured. The clinical response
was assigned into 5 groups: complete response (CR), partial response (PR), marginal response, stable disease (SD),
and disease progression. Pathologic response of the primary tumor was assigned into 2 groups: pathologic CR
(pCR) (defined as no evidence of residual invasive disease
in mastectomy or lumpectomy specimen) or non-pCR.
The primary endpoints of the study were clinical and
pathologic response to the treatment and toxicity associ-

ated with that treatment. Secondary endpoints were recurrence-free survival (RFS) and OS.
Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables were summarized with means and
standard deviations. Kappa statistics were computed to
assess response category agreement beyond chance
between physical examination versus mammography or
MRI. Chi-square tests and their exact small sample size P
values were computed for comparing proportions. Student t tests were used to compare continuous variables
between 2 groups. Backward stepwise logistic regression
was used to identify the independent predicting variables
for pCR. Survival curves were estimated using the
Kaplan-Meier method and were compared in log-rank
tests.
Toxicity Assessment
Toxicity after 4 cycles of neoadjuvant therapy was evaluated according to the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events,
which includes constitutional symptoms; allergic reactions; and cardiovascular, skin, gastrointestinal, hematologic, hepatic, renal, neurologic, metabolic, and infectious
conditions.

RESULTS
Demographic and toxicity data obtained during neoadjuvant treatment are reported for all 74 enrolled patients.
One patient with bilateral disease was excluded from all
analyses, and 2 patients who did not undergo surgery were
excluded from the analysis for pathologic response. Seventy-three patients were included in the analysis of clinical
response, and 71 patients were included in the pathologic
response analysis. Forty-4four patients had HER2-negative disease, and 30 patients had HER2-positive disease.
All 44 patients with HER2-negative disease and 15
patients with HER2-positive disease were randomized to
receive neoadjuvant TC, and the other 15 HER2-positive
patients received TCH.
Patient Characteristics
The patients and their tumor characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Fifty-eight patients (79.5%) had infiltrating ductal cancer (IDC), and 9 patients (12.3%) had
infiltrating lobular cancer. Eighty-one percent of patients
had T3/T4 tumors, including 11 patients with IBC. The
mean tumor size for the group was 7.75 cm (7.64 cm in
patients with TNBC, 7.78 cm in patients with HER2-

these patients were considered candidates for breast-conservation surgery.
Of the 73 patients who were included in the clinical
response analysis, 11 patients (15.1%) had TNBC, 30
patients (41.1%) had HER2-positive breast cancer, and
32 patients (43.8%) had hormone receptor-positive/
HER2-negative breast cancer.
Clinical and Pathologic Response to
Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
Of the 73 patients who were evaluated for clinical
response, only 39 had evaluable mammography, 32
patients had false-negative or nonevaluable mammography, and 2 patients could not undergo mammography
because of the advanced nature of T4 breast cancer. Fiftysix patients had MRI studies obtained both at baseline
and at the end of neoadjuvant treatment. Thirty-three

4230

patients (45.2%) had a clinical CR (cCR), and 34 patients
(46.6%) had a clinical PR on clinical examination
(Table 2). Of the 39 patients who had evaluable mammography studies, 18 patients (46.2%) had a mammographic CR. Of the 56 patients who had MRI studies,
10 patients (17.9%) had an MRI CR. When the 2 breastimaging modalities were compared with clinical examination, there was no agreement beyond chance (mammography: j ¼ 0.07 [P ¼ .175]; MRI: j ¼ 0.15 [P ¼ .0876])
(Table 3). The sample size for the kappa test in this study
was not sufficiently large; therefore, the P values should be
interpreted with caution.
The mean tumor size of the entire group was
decreased from 7.75 cm at baseline to 2.20 cm after neoadjuvant treatment on clinical examination. Thirty-one
patients (43.7%) underwent lumpectomy, and 40
patients underwent mastectomy (56.3%). Twenty-eight
patients (39.5%) underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy
(7 patients at baseline and 21 patients after neoadjuvant
treatment), and 43 patients (60.5%) underwent axillary
lymph node dissection.
Seventy-one patients underwent definitive cancer
surgery and had their tumor response evaluated pathologically. Nineteen of 71 patients (26.8%) had pCR of the
invasive breast cancer, including 6 patients with TNBC, 7
patients with HER2-positive cancers, and 6 patients with
hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer
(pCR rates: 54.6%, 24.1%, and 19.4%, respectively)
(Fig. 1). In the HER2-positive group, the pCR rate was
40% when trastuzumab was administered with 4 cycles of
TC and 7.1% if only chemotherapy was received preoperatively. The patients with TNBC who received TC and
the patients with HER2-positive cancer who received preoperative TCH had a statistically significant advantage of
achieving pCR with the regimen (Fig. 1). Because the
mean baseline tumor size was similar for the 3 subgroups,

we determined that tumor size was not responsible for the
differences in pathologic complete tumor response
observed in the 3 subtypes of breast cancer.
In univariate analyses using chi-square tests
(Table 4), TNBC, ER-negative status, PgR-negative status, ER-negative/PgR-negative status, and IDC were predictors of a pCR to the neoadjuvant regimen used in this
study for patients who had large breast cancers. Tumor
(T) classification and the addition of trastuzumab to the
regimen for patients who had HER2-positive disease had
a trend toward a favorable effect on the pCR rate. T4
tumors were associated with a low rate of pCR. In total,
17 patients had T4 disease, including 11 patients with
T4d disease. The only patient who achieved a pCR after 4
cycles of neoadjuvant treatment had T4d TNBC. A multivariate logistic regression with backward stepwise selec-

tion was used to simultaneously correlate clinical and
pathologic factors with pCR (P  .05). Age, ER status,
PgR status, T classification, tumor histologic type, and
TNBC were retained in the model as significant factors.
IDC tumor type was the most significant factor correlated
with pCR. The exact odds ratio estimated for IDC versus
all others was 8.47 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-22.5;
P ¼ .0219).
When the pathologic tumor response was examined
among 71 evaluable patients, 19 patients had no residual
invasive cancer. The median pathologic residual tumor
size was 2.2 cm, which was the same as the size on clinical
assessment by physical examination. Of the 19 patients
who achieved a pCR, 11 patients had no evidence of either
invasive disease or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and 8
patients had only residual DCIS.
Thirty-five of 71 patients (49.3%) had pathologic
positive lymph node status (N), including with 16 patients
(22.5%) N1 disease, 13 patients (18.3%) with N2 disease,
and 6 patients (8.5%) with N3 disease. The status of lymph
node metastasis after neoadjuvant treatment was proportionate to the extent of residual disease present in the breast.
Of the 11 patients who had no residual invasive or in situ
disease, all had N0 lymph node status. Of the 8 patients
who had residual DCIS, 4 patients had positive lymph
nodes (N1 in 2 patients and N2 in 2 patients). Although we
do not expect chemotherapy to affect DCIS, the presence
of DCIS seems to be correlated with an incomplete lymph
node response. Of the 52 patients who had residual invasive
breast disease, 31 patients had positive lymph node disease
(N1 in 14 patients, N2 in 11 patients, and N3 in 6 patients)
(Table 5).
The cCR rates among patients with TNBC, HER2positive tumors, and hormone receptor-positive/HER2negative tumors were 45.4% (5 of 11 patients), 50% (15
of 30 patients), and 40.6% (13 of 32 patients), respectively. The similarity in the cCR rate for the 3 subgroups

Toxicity
All 74 enrolled patients completed prescribed neoadjuvant treatment for which toxicity is reported. The 5 most
frequently observed adverse effects for the entire group,
including those who received TCH, were similar. The
incidence for all patients was as follows: alopecia, 89.2%;,
fatigue, 87.8%; nausea, 79.7%; anemia, 71.6%; and leukopenia, 62.2%.
No deaths were associated with the study treatment.
Grade 3/4 toxicity other than hematologic toxicities, such
as neutropenia (43%), leukopenia (17.6%), lymphopenia
(5%), and febrile neutropenia (4%), were rare. Grade 3
docetaxel hypersensitivity was noted in 4% of patients,
and all other grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in <2% of
patients. The types of grade 3/4 events observed in the TC
group versus the TCH group were similar; however, the
frequency of grade 3/4 leukopenia, lymphopenia, and febrile neutropenia was higher in the TCH group than in the
TC group.
Peripheral neuropathy is a unique side effect of taxanes. In the current study, 4 patients (5.5%) experienced
grade 1/2 peripheral neuropathy, and 12 patients (16.2%)
had grade 1 tingling and/or paresthesia.
Cardiotoxicity, which is a concern in the adjuvant
use of trastuzumab for treating breast cancer, was evaluated mainly by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)
using either echocardiograms or multiple-gated acquisition scans at baseline and postneoadjuvant treatment and
after completing all 52 weeks of trastuzumab treatment.
Of the 74 patients who were treated, 6 patients (8.1%)
had a reduction in the LVEF between 10% and 15% from
baseline, including 4 of 59 patients who received chemotherapy alone (6.8%) and 2 of 15 patients who received

1 patient had both local and distant recurrences. Seven
patients died of recurrent disease, and 1 patient who
achieved a pCR died of a cause unrelated cancer.
The RFS for patients who achieved a pCR versus
patients who did not achieve a pCR was 93.8% versus
78.4%, respectively, at 2 years and 83.3% versus 58%,
respectively, at 3 years (P ¼ .1222). For patients who
achieved a cCR versus patients who did not achieve a
cCR, the RFS rate was 80.9% versus 83.9%, respectively,
at 2 years and 65% versus 64.3%, respectively, at 3 years
(P ¼ .999). Figure 2a,b provides the RFS curves according
to pCR and cCR. The RFS probabilities were better in the
pCR group than the in non-pCR group, and the differences approached statistical significance (P ¼ .1227).
Within the subgroup of patients with HER2-positive tumors, the estimated survival rate was determined
according to the type of neoadjuvant treatment received:
TCH versus TC. The log-rank test was used to compare
survival curves between these 2 groups of patients.
Although the RFS rate seemed slightly better in the neoadjuvant TCH group, the OS and RFS rates were statistically similar between the 2 groups (P ¼ .5055 and P ¼
.1752, respectively). This finding was not surprising,
because both groups received identical total doses of TC
and trastuzumab.

TCH (13.3%). None of those patients had a decrease in
LVEF below the normal limit of 55% to 60%.
Of all 74 treated patients, 1 patients (1.3%) had
worsening hypertension that exceeded her baseline condition, 4 patients (5.4%) had tachycardia, 7 patients
(10.8%) reported chest pain, and 6 patients (10.6%) had
swelling that may have been associated with cardiovascular events. Edema, tachycardia, dyspnea, and chest pain
were slightly more frequent in the 15 patients who
received neoadjuvant TCH. No significant cardiotoxicity
was observed in any patient, regardless of trastuzumab
administration.
Follow-Up and Survival Data
Follow-up data were available for all patients. The median
follow-up was 1.9 years. Local recurrences developed in 2
patients, distant recurrences developed in 13 patients, and

DISCUSSION
In this study, neoadjuvant treatment consisting of TC
with or without trastuzumab was effective in treating
breast cancer of all types. This regimen achieved a 45.2%
cCR rate and a 46.6% PR rate in 73 patients who had
advanced breast cancer. Forty-four percent of these
patients were able to undergo lumpectomy for treatment,
which initially was deemed impossible. In the remaining
56% of patients, mastectomy was chosen because of the
significant amount of residual disease, patient preference,
or surgeon recommendation. A tumor-free surgical margin was achieved in all patients. Clinical assessment of the
breast tumor size, although not useful for predicting survival outcome, was important in deciding the type of surgery for local treatment.
Compared with pathologic tumor response, clinical
assessment by physical examination or mammography
frequently overestimated the response. At the same time,
the pCRs also were missed on clinical assessment, especially by MRI. Of all the clinical assessments, mammography was the least dependable in assessing large breast
cancers both before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

pCR of Locally Advanced TNBC to TC/Chang et al

Forty-seven percent of all mammography studies fell into
the nonevaluable category because of false-negative findings or nonmeasurable nature of the mammography findings. Of the patients who had measurable disease on
mammography, the tumor size frequently did not match
the size noted during the other clinical assessment at the
beginning and during the pathologic measurement at the
end.
Although clinical assessment of primary tumor size
suffered from imperfect measurement, clinical assessment
for lymph node metastasis was even more difficult. Negative axilla predicted by clinical examination and PET
scans at the end of neoadjuvant treatment more frequently
was incorrect than correct in predicting pathologic lymph
node stage. The pathologic lymph node status was predicted better by the baseline evaluation.31 Our results suggested that patients with clinically positive lymph nodes at
baseline frequently had pathologically proven metastasis
after neoadjuvant treatment, even when the clinical examination and PET scan results converted to normal. Thus,
surgical staging of the lymph nodes cannot be spared even
in women with negative axillae at the end of neoadjuvant
treatment and especially in those who present initially
with suspicious lymph nodes. In this study, patients who
achieved a pCR of the primary tumor for both invasive
disease and DCIS had no lymph node involvement.
Although residual DCIS in the breast was not expected to
reflect the efficacy of chemotherapy, patients who had residual DCIS had lymph node involvement, although the
involvement was limited and infrequent. Not achieving a
pCR of the primary tumor was associated with more
extensive lymph node involvement in patients with
advanced disease.
It is well known that neoadjuvant chemotherapy
induces various degrees of tumor response in patients with
similar disease stage and tumor histology. Our current
results suggest that negative hormone receptor status (either ER, or PgR, or both), ductal histology, and TNBC
predict a better chance of achieving a pCR after TC. The
overall pCR rate was 26.8%, including 81% with T3/T4
breast cancer and 11 patients with IBC. Our study
included patients with significantly larger and more
advanced cancer compared with other series reported in
the literature (Table 6). For HER2-positive tumors, adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy predicted a better
chance of achieving pCR. In our study, a pCR was
achieved by 55% of patients with TNBC, by 40% of
patients with HER2-positive cancer who received simultaneous chemotherapy and trastuzumab, by 7% of patients

with HER2-positive breast cancer who received chemotherapy alone, and by 19% of patients with hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer. The pCR
rates achieved in this study were comparable to the best
results reported in the literature.33,35,36,38-40 In reviewing
the representative neoadjuvant trials, significant differences in tumor stage, in the number of cycles used in preoperative treatment, and in the definition of pCR are noted
among these studies. In our study, approximately 81% of
patients had T3-T4 disease, including a significant number with IBC compared with other trials, in which the
patients mainly had smaller tumors and T4 disease was
excluded. When the mean or median tumor size was available for comparison, our patients also had significantly
larger tumors than the patients in other reports. In our
study, only 4 cycles of neoadjuvant therapy were given as
opposed to 6 cycles reported by all others. These differences may have contributed to the differences in the
reported pCR rates. Therefore, comparisons of the results
from different trials can be difficult.
The superior pCR rate observed in the patients with
TNBC in our study suggests that TC is among the most
effective first-line treatments for these patients. Additional
studies in patients with TNBC will be required to confirm
the effectiveness of this regimen and to explore additional
targeted therapy for further improvement. Emerging
studies identifying molecular markers that profile the success of drug treatment will be extremely important in
improving tumor classification and patient selection, and
the pCR rate can be used as a surrogate marker to evaluate
more treatments.41,42
