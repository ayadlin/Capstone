ABSTRACT
Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are the most aggressive and hard-to-treat
breast tumors with poor prognosis, and exploration for novel therapeutic drugs is
impending. Arctigenin (Atn), a bioactive lignan isolated from seeds of Arctium lappa
L, has been reported to inhibit many cancer types; however, the effect of Atn on TNBC
remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that Atn decreased proliferation, and
induced apoptosis in TNBC cells. Furthermore, we explored the underlying mechanism
of Atn inhibition on TNBC cells. Computational docking and affinity assay showed
that Atn bound to the SH2 domain of STAT3. Atn inhibited STAT3 binding to genomic
DNA by disrupting hydrogen bond linking between DNA and STAT3. In addition, Atn
augmented Taxotere®-induced TNBC cell cytotoxicity. TNBC xenograft tests also
confirmed the antitumor effect of Atn in vivo. These characteristics render Atn as a
promising candidate drug for further development and for designing new effective
STAT3 inhibitors

INTRODUCTION

afflict a great number of young women, and are more
likely to recur earlier at distant sites, thereby leading to
poor overall prognosis [4, 5]. TNBC is the only major
type of breast cancer without specific targeted therapy for
improving patient outcomes. Novel agents that can inhibit
the proliferation and metastasis of TNBC cells must be
identified to improve treatment outcomes in patients.
Signal transducers and activators of transcription
(STATs) are a family of transcription factors that can be
activated by tyrosine phosphorylation by the members of
the Jak tyrosine kinase family in response to a variety of
cytokines and growth factors [6, 7]. This family, including
STATs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5a, 5b, and 6, promote tumor cell
survival, proliferation and drug resistance [8]. In cancer,

Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent carcinoma
and the second leading cause of mortality in women
worldwide; more than one million cases of breast cancer
occur, and more than 400,000 deaths are recorded annually
worldwide [1]. Approximately, 12%-24% of breast cancers
are triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) [2]. TNBC
is characterized by the absence of estrogen receptor,
progesterone receptor, and HER-2 expression; this cancer
results in high morbidity and mortality because of its rapid
growth rate, metastatic potential, and frequently acquired
treatment resistance [3]. Studies have shown that tumors
of this aggressive type are of higher histological grade,

STATs are often constitutively activated in response to
the abnormal binding of a large number of hormones
and cytokines to their corresponding receptors [9].
Among the STATs, STAT3 is often constitutively actived
in various human cancers including mammary of solid
carcinoma and hematologic malignancies [10]. Especially
in TNBC, a high percentage of carcinomatous tissues
exhibit persistent STAT3 activation [11]. Previous studies
found that a majority of STAT3 abnormal activation
derived from upstream signaling dysregulations, which
over-phosphorylated STAT3 [11, 12]. Whereas, only a
fraction of STAT3 over-activation results from somatic
mutations [13]. Activated STAT3 can up-regulate genes
encoding cell-cycle regulators (Cyclin D1 and c-Myc),
apoptosis inhibitors (Mcl-1, Bcl-xl, and survivin), and
angiogenesis inducers (VEGF). These genes are important
molecular cubs for tumor progression [8, 14]. In addition,
aberrant STAT3 expression is significantly associated
with cell survival, epithelial to mesenchymal transition
(EMT), lymphoma invasion, and metastasis by regulating
these pivotal intracellular signaling cascades in various
malignant diseases [15–18]. STAT3 is important for breast
involution after weaning and considered a prognostic
factor for breast cancer [19].
Arctium lappa L. (Asteraceae) is a medicinal plant
widely distributed in China, Japan, and Korea. This plant
is used in folk medicine as diuretic, anti-inflammation,
anti-hypertension, depurative, anti-ulceration, digestive
stimulant, and antioxidant agents [20, 21]. Arctigenin
(Atn, Figure 1A) is a bioactive lignan isolated from the
seeds of A. lappa L. Atn exerts anti-inflammatory effects
by inhibiting nuclear transcription factor-kappa B (NF-κB)
[19]. Atn can also enhance the chemosensitivity of several
cancer cells (HepG2, HeLa, and K562) to cisplatin at high
doses [22].
The mechanism through which Atn inhibits the
proliferation of human TNBC cells or enhances the
chemosensitivity of cancer cells remains less understood.
In this study, we investigated the effect of Atn on human
breast cancer cells and the mechanisms of Atn against
highly invasive TNBCs.

more sensitive to Atn with IC50 of 0.787 and 0.283 μM,
respectively (Figure 1B–1D; Table 1). Atn inhibited the
growth of MDA-MB-231 (Figure 1E) and MDA-MB-468
(Figure 1F) cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner,
as assessed by trypan blue exclusion assay. Atn also
significantly suppressed the clonogenic activity of MDAMB-231 cells (Figure 1G). Therefore, highly invasive
TNBC cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, are
more sensitive to Atn treatment than the other cell lines.
Basing on these results, we conducted the following
experiments to investigate the mechanism of Atn in TNBC
cells by using MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells.

RESULTS

Human breast cancer cells express constitutively
active STAT3 [3]. Whether Atn can inhibit the constitutive
STAT3 activation in TNBC cells was examined. MDAMB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells were treated with
increasing Atn concentrations for 24 h and subjected to
Western blot analysis to assess signaling changes. Atn
significantly reduced the tyrosine phosphorylation of
STAT3 (p-STAT3 at Tyr705) and did not alter STAT3
protein expression. We also assessed the effect of Atn
on pSer727, which was constitutively phosphorylated in
both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines. Atn
did not reduce pS727 in both cell lines (Figure 3A). All
seven STAT family members are detectable, specifically
STAT 1, 3, and 5a/b, in all breast cancer subtypes [23].

Atn inhibits invasion, migration and induces
apoptosis of TNBC cells
Considering that highly invasive TNBCs are more
sensitive to Atn treatment than poorly invasive cells,
we determined whether Atn inhibits the invasion and
migration of breast cancer cells. Invasion assay was
performed in MDA-MB-231 cells by using Matrigelcoated 24-well microchemotaxis chambers in the presence
of Atn. Atn (0–0.4 µM) suppressed the invasion of MDAMB-231 cells (Figure 2A). To further explore the effect
of Atn on cell migration, we treated MDA-MB-231 cells
with Atn (0–0.4 µM) and performed wound healing assay
after 24 h. Atn significantly reduced MDA-MB-231 cell
migration in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2B). These
results suggested that Atn exhibited anti-invasive behavior
toward TNBCs at low-cytotoxic concentrations.
To determine the cell death pathways induced by
Atn, we treated MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells
with increasing Atn concentrations for 24 h. Western
blot results showed the presence of PARP cleavage and a
significant dose-dependent decrease in pro-caspases 3 and
9 in Atn-treated cells (Figures 2C and 2D). These results
indicated that Atn induced TNBC cell death via caspasedependent apoptosis.

TNBC cells

Effects of Atn on cell proliferation and growth of
breast cancer cell lines
We tested the effects of Atn on breast cancer and
normal human mammary epithelial cell lines. The normal
human mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A was less
sensitive to Atn than MDA-MB-435S, MDA-MB-453,
MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell
lines (Figure 1B). Poor migratory cell lines, MCF-7 and
SK-BR3 cells, were the most resistant to Atn with IC50 >
20 μM for 24 h (Figure 1B). Interestingly, highly invasive
(MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) TNBC cells were

Whether Atn inhibits the activation of other STAT
proteins in TNBCs was further investigated. Under
the condition that Atn completely inhibits STAT3
phosphorylation, neither the level of constitutively
phosphorylated STAT5 and STAT1 nor the expression
of STAT5 and STAT1 proteins was altered (Figure 3A).
Phosphorylation of STAT3 leads to its dimerization and

translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. To
confirm whether Atn inhibits the nuclear translocation
of STAT3, we prepared nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts
of Atn-treated and untreated cells by using NE-PER
Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Kit. Exposure to Atn
substantially inhibited the translocation of STAT3 from
the cytoplasm to the nucleus (Figures 3B and 3C).

IL-6-stimulated STAT3 phosphorylation is a
common model for studying STAT3 inhibition [24].
In clinic, IL-6-mediated STAT3 abnormal activation
predicts tumor progression and poor prognosis in breast,
lung, and hematopoietic tumors with gp130 constitutive
activation [25] or elevated IL-6 levels [26, 27]. Hence,
we examined whether Atn inhibits IL-6-stimulated
STAT3 phosphorylation. IL-6 (10 ng/ml) treatment
induced STAT3 activation (Figures 3D and 3E). However,
pretreatment with Atn significantly inhibited IL-6-induced
STAT3 activation. This pretreatment also decreased
STAT3 activation to levels below that in non-stimulated
cells. EGF activated STAT3 via gp130-independent EGFR
[28] and a strong correlation was found between nuclear
STAT3 activation and EGFR expression in breast cancers
through immunohistochemical analysis [29]. Moreover,
somatic-activating mutations in EGFR resulted in STAT3
over-activation through IL-6 production in human lung

adenocarcinomas [30]. Therefore, we examined whether
Atn inhibits EGF-stimulated STAT3 phosphorylation.
EGF (100 ng/ml) treatment resulted in EGFR and
STAT3 activation (Figures 3F and 3G). Nevertheless,
pretreatment with Atn significantly inhibited EGFinduced STAT3 activation, but Atn treatment did not alter
EGFR phosphorylation. These results suggested that Atn
can inhibit IL-6 and EGF-mediated STAT3 abnormal
activation.

Atn is a STAT3 inhibitor
Various computational approaches were used to
examine the binding between Atn and pSTAT3 in silico.
Atn was computationally docked onto the SH2, linker,
DNA-binding, and coiled-coil domains; the relevant Atn/
protein affinities were scored by Autodock 4.2 program
and molecular dynamics simulation (MDS). Considering

loading control.

the free energy values of binding G-bind and entropic
components predicted for the interaction of Atn with the
STAT3 domains obtained, we ascertained that Atn binds
to the pSTAT3 SH2 domain and induces the inhibition of
STAT3-Y705 phosphorylation. To understand the basis
of the remarkable high affinity of Atn for pSTAT3, we
performed a per-residue decomposition analysis of the
free energy of binding. The interaction spectrum showed
that the residues mostly involved in the binding to Atn
clustered in the region ranging from Arg688 to Pro695
in the SH2 domain (Figure 4A). Notably, four residues
(Arg688, Pro689, His694 and Pro695) were engaged in
major stabilizing interactions with Atn (Figure 4B).
To experimentally confirm Atn/STAT3 interaction,
biotinylated Atn (Bio-Atn, Figure 4C) was synthesized and
validated by nuclear magnetic resonance (Supplementary
Figure S1), with a purity of 95% determined by HPLC. In
Bio-Atn-treated MDA-MB-231 cells, STAT3 was pulled
down by streptavidin agarose (S. agarose, Figure 4D).
The in vitro experiment showed that the binding of BioAtn to STAT3 was significantly attenuated by unlabeled
Atn (Figure 4E), indicating the direct binding of Atn to
STAT3. To confirm which residues were critical for the
Atn interaction, site-directed mutagenesis on STAT3 was
performed and plasmids containing wild type (WT) or
mutant STAT3 (R688A, P689A, H694A, or P695A) were
transfected into MDA-MB-231 cells to purify STAT3
protein for in vitro binding analysis (Figure 4F). The
results showed that WT STAT3 strongly recruited Atn,
while H694A mutation has no competitive inhibition
to the binding affinity of Atn/STAT3; however, R688A,
P689A, and P695A mutations drastically inhibited STAT3
binding to Atn (Figure 4F), indicating that R688, P689,
and P695, especially P695 of STAT3 is critical for AtnSTAT3 binding.

the protein STAT3-Y2P exhibited higher binding affinity
to DNA, and the binding free energy of the STAT3-Y2P to
DNA increased by 88.12 kcal/mol compared with that of
the STAT3-Y1P-DNA complex. We concluded that Y2P is
the most favorable protonation state.
For comparison, the two average conformations
(STAT3-WT-DNA and STAT3-Y2P-DNA) of the last
50 ns of the MDS trajectories were superimposed on the
crystal structure (Figure 5E), which significantly differed
from each other. STAT3-Y705P bound to the T-rich
minor groove of DNA in a closely chimeric conformation
(Figure 5E), which cannot be found in STAT3-WT-DNA
average conformation. As observed from the STAT3WT-DNA average conformation, DNA escaped from
the protein WT-STAT3. Analysis of binding free energy
decomposition further showed that DNA could bind to
STAT3-Y705P through residues Leu382 to Arg469 with
high affinity (Figures 5F and 5G). DNA could not bind
to WT-STAT3 because of inactive conformation. As listed
in Table 2, a lower affinity was observed between protein
WT-STAT3 and DNA. We concluded that Y705P plays a
key role in DNA binding to STAT3, which is blocked by
Atn binding to the SH2 domain of STAT3-Y705P.

Hydrogen bond analysis in binding modes
Atn inhibits constitutively active STAT3 (Y705)
in human TNBC cells. As such, we analyzed hydrogen
binding modes between DNA and protein pSTAT3 in all
atomic levels. The STAT3/Y705P-DNA hydrogen bonds
were analyzed (Figure 5H, Table 3). Seven hydrogen bonds
were identified between the carbon atoms in sugar moieties,
phosphate and oxygen atoms of the DNA backbone
and STAT3-b interfaces; these bonds are the following:
Arg414-1007DT, Thr341-1007DT, Arg423-1006DT,
Ser465-1006DT Arg382-1006DT Gln469-1005DT, and
Asn466-1007DT. STAT3-b exclusively formed hydrogen
bonds with the DNA sugar-phosphate oxygen backbone.
Protein residues are always hydrogen bond acceptors,
and the DNA bases are hydrogen bond donors. In the
system STAT3-WT-DNA, fewer hydrogen bonds are
formed between STAT3-b and DNA; the occupancy
period of these interactions is generally longer compared
with the numerous interactions formed by STAT3-b. This
observation is caused by the higher mobility of the DNAbinding domain of STAT3-b, which allows hydrogen bond
interacting residues (Arg414, Thr341, Arg423, Ser465,
Arg382, Gln469, and Asn466) to move far from the DNA
T-rich groove; by contrast, the interface with the STAT3-b
is less variable as the simulation time progresses.
Overall, we conclude that Atn inhibited TNBC
growth and invasion and induced cancer cell apoptosis
mainly through the inhibition of the STAT3 signal pathway
(Figure 5I).

Atn inhibits STAT3 downstream target genes
expressions via inhibition of STAT3 binding to
genomic DNA
To validate the effect of Atn on the transcription
activity of STAT3, we detected the expression of STAT3
downstream target genes. Figures 5A–5D showed that
the mRNA and protein expression levels of cyclin D1
and Mcl-1 decreased after Atn treatment in MDAMB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines. STAT3-Y705
phosphorylation has two protonation states, Y1P and Y2P
[31]. To investigate the interaction contribution spectrum
of binding free energy on DNA and STAT3-WT or
STAT3-Y705 phosphorylation complex, we calculated the
absolute binding free energy values for the two systems
by using MM-GBSA method. The corresponding total
binding free energy values of STAT3-Y1P-DNA and
STAT3-Y2P-DNA complexes are −280.26 and −368.38
kcal/mol, respectively (Table 2); these results implied that

Atn synergistically augments Taxotere®-induced

cells were treated with Tax for 24 h in the presence of
Atn (0, 0.4, and 0.8 μM) and then analyzed through MTT
assay. Our results showed that Atn significantly enhanced
the cytotoxicity of Tax (Figures 6A and 6B). We analyzed
the CI value by using the formula assisted with CalcuSyn
software (Version 2.1) and found that CI values were less
than 1 (Table 4). This finding indicated that Atn and Tax
synergistically inhibited TNBC cells. To gain insights into

STAT3 plays a crucial role in promoting TNBC
cell survival, anti-apoptosis, and drug resistance; thus, we
hypothesized that the inhibition of STAT3 activity by Atn

agent Taxotere® (Tax). MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468

of Atn and Tax, we investigated the apoptosis pathway

growth (P < 0.01). Moreover, treatment with Atn did
not reduce the body weight of mice, thereby suggesting
that Atn had no obvious toxic side effects (Figure 7C).
The tumor samples of mice bearing MDA-MB-231 cells
were isolated. The cells were harvested, and experiments
were conducted to determine whether Atn inhibits STAT3
activation in vivo. Remarkably, samples from Atn-treated
mice showed downregulated pSTAT3 levels compared
with tumor tissues from vehicle mice (Figures 7D
and 7E). The expression of STAT3 downstream genes
(cyclin D1 and Mcl-1) was also detected by real-time
quantitative PCR, and samples from Atn-treated mice
showed downregulated cyclin D1 and Mcl-1 mRNA
expression levels compared with tumor tissues from
vehicle mice (Figure 7F). These results demonstrated that
the administration of Atn exhibits considerable potential
in TNBC therapy.

various diseases for thousands of years. In the field of
oncology, natural small-molecule compounds from Chinese
herbal medicines have been the inspiration for drug
discovery. Atn is a phenylpropanoid dibenzylbutyrolactone
lignan that inhibits the growth of several cancer cells,
including those of the lungs, colon, liver, leukocytes, and
stomach [22, 32, 33]. Hsieh [34] et al. reported that Atn
induces apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells through the ROS/
p38 MAPK pathway and epigenetic regulation; they found
that Atn suppresses the proliferation of MDA-MB-231
cells with 48 h IC50 of 1.98 μM. However, the present study

showed that the 24 h IC50 of Atn on MDA-MB-231cells
was 0.787 μM. Atn also inhibited other breast cancer cell
lines with 24 h IC50 values of 0.285–3.756 μM (Table 1);
these cell lines included MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-453,
and MDA-MB-435S. Our results indicated that TNBC
cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 were more
sensitive to Atn treatment. Atn also inhibited anchoragedependent (cell proliferation) and anchorage-independent
(colony formation) growth of TNBC cells (Figure 1).
Apoptotic pathways that ultimately lead to the
activation of effector caspases (casp-3, casp-2, and casp- 7)
and PARP cleavage have been characterized in breast

cancer [35]. Moreover, apoptosis is the main mechanism
of cell death induced by chemotherapy drugs. In this study,
Atn induced casp-3 and casp-9 activation, followed by
PARP cleavage in two TNBC cell lines (Figure 2); thereby
suggesting that Atn induces an internal caspase-dependent
apoptosis in TNBC cells. In conclusion, Atn treatment
showed proliferation inhibitory effect and cell apoptosis in
TNBC cells, which were associated with caspase activation.
We found a different mechanism of Atn inhibiting
TNSC cells in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468
cells through inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation
activation. STAT3 is an attractive cancer drug target
molecule because of its over-expression and constituted
activation in numerous cancers [36, 37]. Constitutive
activation of STAT3 in malignance is derived from
various mechanisms, such as a lack of negative regulation
of upstream kinases, upstream positive signaling from

mutated kinases, or other feedback inhibitors. This
continuously activated state of STAT3 pathway promotes
tumor cell growth, migration, invasion, angiogenesis,
metastasis, and drug resistance, but inhibits apoptosis.
New evidences also demonstrated that STAT3 promoted
cancer progression through participation in EMT [38],
tumor microenvironment regulation [39] and cancer stem
cell self-renewal and differentiation [40]. STAT3 abnormal
activity accelerates IL-6, HIF1α and VEGF, specifically in
the tumor microenvironment. In the loop, IL-6 is involved
in cancer progressions, and the elevation in serum predicts
poor prognosis in certain cancers, including breast
cancer [26, 27]. In gefitinib-resistant non-small-cell lung
cancer, IL-6R/JAK1/STAT3 signaling activation leads
to de novo resistance to irreversible EGFR inhibitors
[41]. In human liver cancer cells, inactivated STAT3
causes the inhibition of IL-6-mediated anti-apoptotic

activity. EGFR over-activation is correlated with breast
cancer progression through activation of STATs 1 and
3. In an investigation of primary breast carcinomas and
normal tissues via immunohistochemical assay, nuclear
STAT3 is significantly correlated with EGFR expression
in breast cancers [42]. In conclusion, both IL-6 and
EGFR promote breast cancer through STAT3 abnormal
activation and predict a poor prognosis. In this study,
we presented that Atn inhibits IL-6 and EGF-induced
STAT3 phosphorylation, but with no effects on EGFR
phosphorylation (Figures 3D–3G).
We used a combined computational and
experimental approach to investigate the molecular direct

binding, as well as the mode of interaction of Atn with
STAT3. Computational docking and MDS showed that Atn
exhibited high-affinity interaction with the SH2 domain of
STAT3 (Figure 4A). The overlap of the Atn binding site
with those of other STAT3 inhibitors was not observed.
Most STAT3 inhibitors are predicted to bind either to the
hydrophilic site, lined by the side chains of the Lys591,
Arg609, Ser611, and Ser613 residues, or to the partially
hydrophobic region composed of the Lys592, Arg595,
Ile597, and Ile634 residues [43]. Atn interacted with a
consistent number of residues (Arg688, Pro689, His694,
and Pro695) in the SH2 domain (Figure 4B). Furthermore,

demonstrated the direct interaction of Atn/STAT3
(Figure 4D and 4E). Moreover, to confirm which residues
were critical for the Atn/STAT3 interaction, site-directed
mutagenesis on STAT3 and then immunoprecipitation
and S. agarose affinity assay demonstrated that Arg688,
Pro689, and Pro695 are critical for Atn binding
(Figure 4F). Our results demonstrated that Atn binds to the
SH2 domain and interferes directly with STAT3 activation
and signaling. Higher afﬁnity with STAT3 likely leads to
higher potency in cellular assays. Moreover, Atn induced
the mobility of the DNA-binding domain of STAT3-b,
resulting in far location of hydrogen bond interacting
residues (Arg414, Thr341, Arg423, Ser465, Arg382,
Gln469, and Asn466) from the DNA T-rich groove.
Therefore, Atn inhibits STAT3 downstream target gene
expression in cellular assays. In summary, with the aid of
structure-based virtual screening, we found that Atn can
inhibit STAT3 by occupy its SH2 domain. Furthermore,
Atn inhibited the DNA-binding activity of STAT3 via
inhibiting constitutively active STAT3 (Y705). Hydrogen
bond binding modes indicated that Atn inhibits STAT3
binding to genomic DNA by disrupting the hydrogen bond
binding between DNA and STAT3 (Figure 5).
Atn also showed enhanced cytotoxicity to TNBC
cells when combined with the conventional agent Tax, a
drug that is currently in clinical trials for the treatment
of solid malignancies (Figure 6). We subcutaneously
injected MDA-MB-231 cells into nude mice and treated
the animals with vehicle control and Atn. After 4 weeks
of treatment, Atn significantly repressed tumor growth
(Figures 7A and 7B). We euthanized the tumor-bearing
mice, collected the tumors, extracted the proteins, and
found that Atn downregulated the STAT3 phosphorylation
(Figure 7D). The fluorescent immunohistochemistry also
confirmed the inhibition (Figure 7E).
In summary, STAT3 is a novel target of Atn action
in TNBC cells. This interaction may provide a significant
benefit to TNBC patients, particularly in combination with
other conventional agents, because STAT3 has diverse
functions and is almost universally activated in TNBC cells.

Atn was determined by HPLC. Commercial Taxotere® was
from Sanofi-Aventis Pharma Dagenham, U.K. (Surrey, UK).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Invasion assay

Reagents

An invasion assay was carried out using 24-well plate
(Corning). A polyvinyl-pyrrolidone-free polycarbonate
filter (8 μm pore size) (Corning) was coated with matrigel
(BD). The lower chamber was filled with medium
containing 20% FBS as chemoattractant. The coated filter
and upper chamber were laid over the lower chamber. Cells
(1 × 104 cells/well) were pre-incubated with Atn for 30 min
at room temperature, and then cell suspension containing
Atn was seeded onto the upper chamber wells. After
incubation for 20 h at 37°C, the filter was fixed and stained
with 2% ethanol containing 0.2% crystal violet (15 min).
After being dried, the stained cells were enumerated under
light microscope at 10 × objective. For quantification, the

Human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, MDAMB-231, SK-BR3, MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-453, and
MDA-MB-435S and Non-tumorigenic MCF-10A human
mammary epithelial cells were obtained from American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC). MCF-7 and SK-BR3
cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) (Gibco) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone) and antibiotics and
incubated in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at
37°C. MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-453, and
MDA-MB-435S cells were maintained in Leibovitz’s L-15
(Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS and Atnibiotics and
incubated in a humidified atmosphere without CO2 at 37°C.
MCF-10A cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 medium
containing 5% horse serum (HS), insulin (10 mg/ml),
epidermal growth factor (EGF, 20 ng/ml), choleratoxin
(100 mg/ml), hydrocortisone (0.5 mg/ml), penicillin (50
U/ml), and streptomycin (50 U/ml), and incubated in a
humidified atmosphere with CO2 at 37°C.

Cell proliferation and cell viability
Cells were seeded into 96-well plate and precultured for 24 h, then treated with Atn for 24 h or 48 h.
Cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay. Cell
viability was estimated by trypan blue dye exclusion.

Soft-agar colony formation assay
Cells were suspended in 1 ml of DMEM or L-15
containing 0.3% low-melting-point agarose (Amresco, USA)
and 10% FBS, and plated on a bottom layer containing 0.6%
agarose and 10% FBS in 6-well plate in triplicate. After 2
weeks, plates were stained with 0.2% gentian violet and the
colonies were counted under light microscope [6].

Arctigenin (Atn) with a purity of up to 98% was
purchased from Shanghai Yuanye Bio-Technology
Co., Ltd. Atn was dissolved in DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich,
U.S.A.) at a stock solution of 50 mM and stored at –20°C.
Biotinylated Atn was synthesized by Boshixing Synthetic
Technologies, Inc. (Shenzhen, China): biotin was condensed
with 2-aminoethylthiol using dicyclohexylcarbodiimide to
afford the corresponding amide, the thiol group of which
was added to the enone moiety of Atn to provide the desired
biotinated Atn. The identity of the compound was verifed
using nuclear magnetic resonance, and the purity of biotinwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Wound healing assay
Cells (4 × 105 cells/2 ml) were seeded in a 6-well
plate and incubated at 37°C until 90% to 100% confluence.
After the confluent cells were scratched with a 200 μl pipet
tip, followed by washing with PBS, and then treated with
Atn in a complete medium. After 24 h of incubation, the
cells were fixed and stained with 2% ethanol containing
0.2% crystal violet powder (15 min), and randomly chosen
fields were photographed under a light microscope at 4×
objective. The number of cells migrated into the scratched
area was calculated.

Computational studies
The crystal structures of STAT3 protein was obtained
from the available pdb file 1BG1 in the Protein Data
Bank repository. The chemical structure of Atn is shown
in Figure 1A. For the sake of getting the most stable
conformation and the electrostatic potential distributions,
we calculated single point energies at the HF/6-31G (d,p)
level by Gaussian 09 program [45]. All docking experiments
were performed with Autodock 4.2. For the AutoDock 4.2
calculation, the grid maps employ a grid module with 70 ×
70 × 70 points of 0.375Å spacing. We employed Lamarckian
genetic algorithm for the docking calculation of the protein
and inhibitor, as the following options: population size
of individuals 150, a maximum number of 25 million
energy evaluations, a maximum number of generations of
27000, a crossover rate of 0.8, a mutation rate of 0.02, and
independent docking runs of 50 were set up. The docked
conformations were clustered using a tolerance of 2 Å rootmean-square deviations and evaluated for the final docking
structure according to the binding free energy. For MD
simulations, the complex protein was performed by using
the AMBER12 program. The AMBER ff99SB force field
parameters were adopted for the MD simulations. The
binding free energy, ΔGbind, between drug/DNA and the
protein was estimated resorting to the MM/PBSA (Molecular
Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area) approach [46].
According to this well-validated methodology, the binding
free energy was obtained as the sum of the interaction energy
between the receptor and the ligand (ΔEMM), the solvation
free energy (ΔGsol), and the conformational entropy
contribution (-TΔS), averaged over a series of snapshots
from the corresponding MDS trajectories [47].

Western blot
Cell pellets were lysed in RIPA buffer containing
50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5%
deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM NaF,
1 mM sodium vanadate, 1 mM PMSF (Sigma), and 1%
protease inhibitors cocktail (Merck). Protein extracts were
quantitated and loaded on 8% to 12% sodium dodecyl
sulfate polyacrylamide gel, electrophoresed, and transferred
onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore). The membrane was
incubated with primary antibody, washed, and incubated
with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary
antibody (Pierce). Detection was performed by using a
chemiluminescent Western detection kit (Cell Signaling
Technology). The antibodies used were Anti-caspase-3, Anticaspase-9, Anti-PARP, Anti-pSTAT3 (Y705), Anti-Jak2, AntipJak2 (Y1007/Y1008), Anti-pSTAT3 (S727), Anti-STAT1,
Anti-pSTAT1 (Y701), Anti-STAT5, and Anti-pSTAT5 (Y694)
(Cell Signaling Technology), Anti-Lamin B, Anti-Cyclin
D1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Anti-Mcl-1, Anti-STAT3
(Proteintech), and Anti-GAPDH (Abmart) antibodies.

Isolation of nuclear and cytoplasmic
fractionation
Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared
with the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Kit
(Thermo Scientific). The purity of nuclear and cytoplasmic
extracts was assessed by Western blot with anti-Lamin B
and anti-GAPDH antibodies, respectively.

Immunoprecipitation and streptavidin agarose
affinity assay
Cell pellets were lysed and the supernatant collection
was incubated with indicated antibodies overnight at
4°C, after which protein A/G Plus beads (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) were added and incubated at 4°C for 4 h.
The beads were washed 4 times in NETN buffer (1% NP- 40,
2 mM EDTA, 40 mM Tris-HCl, 137 mM NaCl, pH 7.4),
resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and boiled for
5 min. For S. agarose affinity assay, cells upon Bio-Atn
were lysed, the lysates were incubated with streptavidin

Real-time quantitative PCR
Expression of genes was examined by real-time
quantitative PCR normalized to expression of GAPDH.
Total RNA was extracted from cell lines or patients’ cells
using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time
PCR was performed using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Perfect
Real Time) (TaKaRa) according to the manufacturer’s

agarose, washed and boiled in SDS-PAGE loading buffer.
For Atn competition, the cell lysates were pretreated
with Atn (10  μM) for 1 h, followed by 50 μM Bio-Atn
treatment for 3 h at 4°C, and S. agarose affinity assay
were performed. Western blot assays were performed as
described.

Surgically excised tumors were cryosectioned to
7 µm thick sections. Then the frozen sections were thawed
and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. After
blocking with 3% BSA/0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h,
sections were incubated with anti-pSTAT3 antibody at 4°C
overnight. Cy3 conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody
was used as the secondary antibody. For visualization of
cell nucleus, DAPI was used. Sections were observed by
Olympus confocal laser scanning microscope.

Drug combination assay
Drug combination is widely used in cancer treatment
to achieve synergistic therapeutic effect and overcomes
drug resistance in clinic. To estimate the effect of Atn
and Taxotere® (Tax) combination, the combination index
(CI) was calculated by the Chou-Talalay equation. MDAMB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells were seeded in 96-well
plates. Drugs were added alone or together at indicated
concentration. The inhibition effect was measured by MTT
assay as mentioned above. The formula of CI = (D)Atn/
(Dx)Atn+ (D)Tax/(Dx)Tax ((D)Atn and (D)Tax: the doses
of compounds Atn and Tax, respectively, necessary to
produce the same effect in combination. Dx: the dose of
one compound alone required producing an effect). With
this formula and assistance of CalcuSyn software (Version
2.1), the combined effects of the two compounds can be
assessed as followes: CI < 1 indicates synergism; CI = 1
indicates additive effect; and CI > 1 indicates antagonism.

Statistical analysis
All experiments were repeated at least three times
and the data were presented as the mean ± SD unless
noted otherwise. Differences between data groups were
evaluated for significance using Student t -test of unpaired
data or one-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni
post -test. P values less than 0.05 indicate statistical
significance.

Human breast cancer xenograft experiments
Female nude immunodeficient mice (nu/nu), 6–8
weeks old, were purchased from Hunan SJA Laboratory
Animal Co., Ltd., and maintained and monitored in a
specific pathogen-free environment. All animal studies
were conducted according to protocols approved by the
Hubei University of Medicine Animal Care and Use
Committee, complying with the rules of Regulations for
the Administration of Affairs Concerning Experimental
Animals (Approved by the State Council of China). The
mice were injected subcutaneously with human breast
cancer MDA-MB-231 cells (6 × 106) suspended in 100 μl
L-15 media into the right flank of each mouse. Treatments
were started when the tumors reached a palpable size.
Mice were randomly divided into two groups and
treated 4 times per week. The control group (n = 7)
received vehicle, while another group (n = 8) received
intraperitoneally (i.p.) injection of Atn (15 mg/ kg).
Caliper measurements of the longest perpendicular tumor
diameters were performed twice a week to estimate
the tumor volume, using the following formula: 4π/3 ×
(width/2)2 × (length/2), representing the 3-dimensional
volume of an ellipse. Animals were sacrificed when
tumors reached 1.5 cm or if the mice appeared moribund
to prevent unnecessary morbidity to the mice. At the time
of the animals’ death, tumors were excised; cells were
lyzed for Real-time quantitative PCR, Western blot, or
immunofluorescence.
