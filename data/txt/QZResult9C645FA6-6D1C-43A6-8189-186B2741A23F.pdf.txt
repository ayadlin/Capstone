Abstract

Author Manuscript

The biological relationships among self-renewal, tumorigenicity, and lineage differentiation of
human osteosarcoma-initiating cells (OSIC) remain elusive, making it difficult to identify and
distinguish OSIC from osteosarcoma-forming cells (OSFC) for developing OSIC-targeted
therapies. Using a new inverse lineage tracking strategy coupled with serial human-to-mouse
xenotransplantation, we identified a subpopulation of osteosarcoma cells with OSIC-like
properties and sought to distinguish them from their progeny, OSFC. We found that serial
transplantation of cells from different osteosarcoma cell lines and primary osteosarcoma tissues
progressively increased the CD49f+ subpopulation composing the bulk of the osteosarcoma mass.
These CD49f+ cells displayed characteristics of OSFC: limited in vivo tumorigenicity, weak
lineage differentiation, more differentiated osteogenic feature, and greater chemo-sensitivity. By
contrast, their parental CD49f−CD133+ cells had an inhibited osteogenic fate, together with OSIClike properties of self-renewal, strong tumorigenicity, and differentiation to CD49f+ progeny.
Hence, the CD49f−CD133+ phenotype appears to identify OSIC-like cells that possess strong

tumorigenicity correlated with an impaired osteogenic fate and the ability to initiate tumor growth
through generation of CD49f+ progeny. These findings advance our understanding of OSIC-like
properties and, for the first time, provide a much-needed distinction between OSIC and OSFC in
this cancer.

Introduction
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Osteosarcoma, generally considered a disease of cell differentiation (1, 2), is the most
common malignant bone tumor (1, 3). Recent findings suggest that non-targeted, cytotoxic
chemotherapy can effectively kill the vast majority of osteosarcoma cells; but a small
fraction of transformed cells, OSIC, survive and thus instigate osteosarcoma re-initiation,
drug resistance, and clinical relapse (2). Hence, identifying OSIC would be crucial steps
toward devising OSIC-targeted therapies, thereby avoiding treatment resistance and the
severe toxicity associated with current, non-selective forms of osteosarcoma chemotherapy.
Investigators focusing on the identification of OSIC have reported that some subpopulations
of osteosarcoma cells express prospective cancer stem cell markers, including CD117+,
Stro-1+ (4), or CD133+ (5-7). Moreover, by activating an exogenous Oct-4 promoter in
primary osteosarcoma cells, Oct-4/GFP+ cells display properties of cancer-initiating cells
(8); whereas an osteosarcoma subpopulation with high ALDH activity also exhibits OSIC
features (9). To date, the relationships among OSIC self-renewal, tumorigenicity, and
lineage differentiation remain unclear, making it difficult to identify and distinguish OSIC
from their OSFC for developing OSIC-targeted therapies.

Author Manuscript

The cancer stem cell hypothesis predicts that only a small fraction of transformed cells are
capable of reconstituting all of the diverse cell types within a particular tumor (10, 11), as
demonstrated in hematologic malignancies (12-14), central nervous system tumors (15),
breast tumors (16), and colon cancer (17). An increasing number of studies show that some
tumor cell subpopulations isolated by prospective stem cell markers possess the properties
of cancer stem cells; however, these results are often confounded by the ability of markernegative counterpart subpopulations to induce tumors. This often led to common
controversy (11, 18-20) that is currently observed in identifying cancer stem cells (15,
21-23). For example, although the role of CD133 as a marker of cancer stem cells (15, 21) is
well documented (11, 19, 20), some studies demonstrate that both CD133+ and CD133–
cells can initiate tumor formation (22, 23). Other studies suggest that a combination of
CD133+ with other markers or ALDH activity is needed in identifying cancer stem cells
(23-26). These controversies reflect the complexity of cancer stem cells. Here, we used an
inverse lineage tracking strategy coupled with serial transplantation to identify OSIC
properties. Our studies show that the gain of strong tumorigenicity seen with OSIC-like
CD49f−CD133+ cells correlates to diminished osteogenic fate, which distinguish them from

their CD49f+ progeny that possess limited tumorigenicity in association with more
differentiated osteogenic features.

Results
Serial xenotransplantation enriches self-renewal and tumorigenicity of osteosarcoma cells

Author Manuscript

To identify osteosarcoma cells with OSIC properties, we used serial xenotransplantation as a
means to enhance OSIC self-renewal and promote lineage differentiation. We first screened
tumorigenicity of four human osteosarcoma cell lines and six primary osteosarcoma samples
by engrafting them into nude mice with subcutaneous injection. We found that KHOS/NP
cells formed tumors at 2 weeks post-injection, U2OS cells at 2 months, and TTC444 cells at
2-3 months (Supplemental Tables 1, 2). Since KHOS/NP cells are virus-transformed cells,
whereas well-established U2OS cells afford the best window of time for amplifying the
OSIC-like property by serial transplantation, we used these cells to derive different
generations of tumor xenografts for in vivo analysis of self-renewal and tumorigenicity. The
results showed that the self-renewal and tumorigenicity of U2OS cells from primary tumor
xenograft to sequential progeny xenografts, designated UT1, UT2, and UT3 cells (Figure
1A), were progressively enhanced. Indeed, a reduction in cell number for transplantation
(from 1 × 107 to 1 × 105 cells) was associated with a reduced time to tumor formation (from
60 days to 7 days). HE staining confirmed that the tumor mass derived from UT2
engraftment retained the same properties as the parental U2OS osteosarcoma xenograft
(Figure 1B). These results show that OSIC activity is progressively enhanced by serial
xenotransplantation, leading to an enhanced production of OSFC that forming the
osteosarcoma mass.

Author Manuscript

We next examined, using orthotopic transplantation, whether the phenotype of osteosarcoma
cells is maintained after serial engraftments. Because UT2 cells offered a better
experimental window-time and have a similar tumorigenicity compared to UT3 cells, we
intrafemorally injected 2 × 105 UT2 cells into mice. Consistent with enhanced self-renewal
and tumorigenicity ascribed to UT2 cells (Figure 1A, third engraft), tumor formation in bone
was taken 2 weeks (Figure 1C, panel ii). HE staining showed tumor growth in the distal
femurs (Figure 1D). These results demonstrate that the enhanced OSIC activity remains
capable of producing OSFC progeny able to form phenotypically recognizable osteosarcoma
in bone.
Enriched OSIC activities correlate with accelerated sphere formation and expression of
stem/progenitor cell-associated genes

Author Manuscript

Cancer stem cells often possess the ability to produce unattached spheres in the absence of
serum (27, 28). To test the enriched OSIC activities for this property, we cultured cells
isolated from different xenograft tissues with basal medium containing methylcellulose. We
found that after 12 days of culture, both the size and number of the floating spheres were
progressively increased, from U2OS to UT1 to UT2 cells. More than 20 spheres with a 70 to
80-μm diameter were observed among each 103 of the initially seeded UT1 or UT2 cells, in
contrast to spheres of <22-μm diameter formed by U2OS cells (Figure 2A). This greater
stem-like sphere formation suggests that OSIC activities are enriched in UT2 cells.

Because analyses of global gene expression pattern between normal and malignant stem cell
populations can provide critical insights into cancer stem cell properties (29), we determined
whether enhanced self-renewal and tumorigenicity in UT2 cells correlate with increased
expression of stem/progenitor cell-associated genes, using microarray analysis as described
(30). Genes whose expression differed from ≥ 2 to 1,000-fold in UT2 vs. U2OS cells were
identified, with more than 3,000 genes classified as up-regulated in UT2 cells (Supplemental
Table 3). Among them, 21 stem or progenitor cell-associated genes were up-regulated
(Figure 2B). Moreover, molecules involved in regulation of self-renewal signaling pathways
in cancer stem cells (11, 18) were up-regulated in UT2 cells compared to U2OS and normal
human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), including those in the Notch, Wnt, and TGFβ
pathways (Figure 2C-H). These data indicate a genetic basis for the enhanced self-renewal
and tumorigenicity in UT2 cells.

Enhanced OSIC self-renewal and tumorigenicity induce a progressive expansion of CD49f+
cells forming the osteosarcoma mass

Author Manuscript

Given that cancer stem cells arise from normal stem cells (10, 11), we predict that OSIC
retain some normal human MSC properties and intrinsic mesenchymal origin, expressing
surface antigens commonly associated with MSC. Thus, enhanced OSIC self-renewal by
serial transplantation should increase OSIC propensity to differentiate to OSFC progeny that
express stem or progenitor markers and form the osteosarcoma mass. To test this idea, we
analyzed the change in expression of different potential phenotypic markers of mesenchymal
origin in U2OS, UT2, and UT3 cells by FACS analysis, using anti-human CD28, CD43,
CD49f, CD59, CD117, CD133 and STRO-1 antibodies. We found that, while many of these
markers showed no or only minor up-regulation in those cells (Figure 3A), the size of the
CD49f+ subpopulation was significantly increased from U2OS to UT2 to UT3 cells (Figure
3B, 3C). Because this increase was associated with enhanced formation of the osteosarcoma
mass from U2OS to UT2 to UT3 cells (Figure 1), we further investigated the expression
levels of CD49f in primary osteosarcoma cells (TTC444, TTC606, TTC712, TTC595,
TTC445, TTC618, TTC814, and CHLA99), MSC, and virus-transformed osteosarcoma
KHOS/NP cells. Interestingly, TTC444, KHOS/NP, UT2, and UT3 cells, which show high
levels of CD49f expression (Figure 3B-D; Supplemental Figure 1), formed osteosarcoma
xenografts within 6-90 days (Figure 1; Supplemental Tables 1, 2). Moreover, higher levels
of CD49f+ cells were inversely related to the time required to form a tumor (Figure 3E, 3F).
Since CD49f is a marker of human MSC progenitors (31, 32), our studies suggest that it
identifies OSFC with the capacity to proliferate actively to constitute the bulk of the
osteosarcoma mass.

CD49f− cells with greater tumorigenicity and drug resistance generate CD49f+
subpopulation
Identification of CD49f+ cells (Figure 3) forming the osteosarcoma mass raises a question:
What subpopulation of U2OS cells possesses OSIC-like properties to give rise to CD49f−
progeny? Because CD49f+ cells account for about 70% of the UT2 cells, we first tested in
vitro whether these cells were derived from the CD49f− fraction. We cultured CD49f+ and
CD49f− subpopulations of UT2 cells for 2 weeks, and then determined the changes in
genetic lineage. FACS analyses showed that the CD49f− subpopulation generated about

10% of the CD49f+ cells, whereas CD49f+ cells (99.6%) remained no change (Figure 4A,
left panel). We then tested the ability of CD49f− cells to generate CD49f+ subpopulation in
vivo, by subcutaneously transplanting purified CD49f− and CD49f+ subpopulations into
NOD/SCID mice. FACS analysis of tumor xenografts showed that the CD49f+ marker was
retained on 99.0% of the xenograft cells transplanted with CD49f+ subset, whereas in
xenografts generated by the CD49f− subpopulation, more than 89% of the cells became
CD49f+ positive (Figure 4A, right panel). These data demonstrate that CD49f− cells can
differentiate to CD49f+ progeny and that certain factors from in vivo vicinity promote
tumorigenicity (33) of CD49f− cells. Together, the above results suggest that the enriched
OSIC-like self-renewal and tumorigenicity in CD49f− fraction gives rise to a large number
of lineage-committed CD49f+ cells (Figures 3, 4A) that ultimately form the osteosarcoma
mass.

Author Manuscript

It has been proposed that daughter cells generated from cancer stem cells can differentiate to
the various cell types seen in the bulk tumor (11, 34, 35). We therefore examined osteogenic
and adipogenic potential of both parent CD49f− and daughter CD49f+ cells. Purified
CD49f− or CD49f+ cells, grown to 70~80% confluence in regular medium, were further
cultured with BDM or FDM for 21 days for inducing osteogenic and adipogenic
differentiation. We found that by using ARS and ORO staining, both CD49f− and CD49f+
cells displayed osteoblast and adipocyte fates, whether they were isolated from UT2 or
KHOS/NP cells (Figure 4B). These data suggest that CD49f+ progeny arising from the
CD49f− fraction retain essentially the same differentiation potential as their parental cells.

Author Manuscript

Because CD49f− cells differentiate to CD49f+ cells (Figure 4A), we sought to test the
tumorigenicity of both subpopulations in NOD/SCID mice. With subcutaneous injections of
10,000 down to 1,000 cells (3 mice per group), we observed that CD49f− cells showed
higher tumorigenicity (33%) than did CD49f+ cells (17%) for up to 32 days (data not
shown). Further tests with subcutaneous injection of 500 cells showed that CD49f− cells had
consistently higher tumorigenic potential (Figure 4C). Since the increase in proportion of
tumor formation was not striking (56% vs. 44%), there may be other subpopulations within
the CD49f− fraction that possess property of OSIC-like tumorigenicity.

Author Manuscript

Cancer stem cells show greater resistance to drugs and toxins than their more differentiated
progeny. We thus assessed the response of both CD49f− and CD49f+ cells to cisplatin or
doxorubicin, drugs currently used to treat osteosarcoma (36). The results indicated that the
CD49f+ subpopulation was drug sensitive compared to controls (Figure 4D; Supplemental
Figure 2). We further determined the inhibition concentration of drug for 50% of cells (IC50)
in CD49f−, CD49f+, and non-sorted (mock) cells using the XTT proliferation assay. The
results showed an IC50 value of 18.9 μM for cisplatin in UT2-CD49f− cells, compared to
4.49 μM and 2.88 μM in UT2-CD49f+ and mock cells (Figure 4E). Similarly, IC50 value of
>30 μM was observed in TTC606-CD49f− cells, compared to 13.9 μM and 17.2 μM in
TTC606-CD49f+ and mock cells (Figure 4F). The CD49f− cells also showed greater
resistance to idarubicin and taxol than did CD49f+ cells, with IC50 values that were as much
as two times higher than those in CD49f+ cells (Figure 4G). Because the CD49f−
subpopulation gives rise to CD49f+ cells, possesses greater tumorigenicity, and has lower
sensitivity to drug treatment than its CD49f+ daughter cells (Figure 4A, 4C-G), we conclude

that CD49f− subpopulation exhibits OSIC-like properties: self-renewal capacity, strong
tumorigenicity, differentiation to tumor-forming CD49f+ progeny, and increased drug
resistance.
CD49f− cells generate the CD133+ subpopulation

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Because the intact CD49f− population does not show prominent tumorigenicity, the OSIClike properties likely reside in one or more fractions of these cells. To address this issue, we
analyzed a group of markers that have been implicated in cancer stem-like cell behavior.
CD133 (alias prominin-1) is a transmembrane protein, and has been classified as a potential
marker of osteosarcoma cells with stem-like cell properties (5-7) and of neural and colon
cancer cells (15, 17, 37). Moreover, CD117+ and Stro-1+ subpopulations of osteosarcoma
cells possess the OSIC-like properties of tumorigenicity and drug resistance (4). We thus
tested whether CD133, CD117, and/or Stro-1 are potential markers of OSIC-like cells within
the CD49f− fraction. FACS analysis confirmed that among UT2 cells, about two thirds
(63.63% + 5.52%) are CD49f+ and 30% CD49f−; whereas 0.97% CD133+ cells were in the
CD49f− subpopulation compared to 5.52% CD133+ cells in the CD49f+ subpopulation
(Figure 5A). These results indicate that the majority of cells in the CD49f− subpopulation
lack the CD133+ marker, and that the CD49f−CD133+ subpopulation accounts for only
about 1% of UT2 cells. Interestingly, after culturing of CD49f− and CD49f+ subpopulations
for 2 weeks, the proportions of CD133+ cells increased to 27.8% among CD49f− cells and to
8.4% among CD49f+ cells (Figure 5B, sections 2 vs. 3 and 4). Because CD49f− cells
differentiate to both CD49f+ and CD133+ cells, we suggest that the increased smaller
proportion of CD133+ cells in the CD49f+ subpopulation (Figure 5B, sections 2 vs. 3)
originates from CD49f− cells. By contrast, the CD117+ subpopulation remained essentially
unchanged in both the CD49f+ and CD49f− fractions of UT2 cells after 14 days of culture
(Figure 5C), whereas Stro-1+ cells showed a slight increase in the CD49f− fraction
compared with the CD49f+ fraction (Figure 5D). This implies that CD133+ cells within the
CD49f− fraction are more promising candidate population with OSIC-like properties than
CD117+ or Stro-1+ cells.

Author Manuscript

Further to test whether candidate partner of CD49f− cells posses OSIC properties, we
examined the tumorigenicity of CD133+, CD133−, CD117+, and Stro-1+ cells by
xenotransplantation of these cells into NOD/SCID mice. The results showed that CD117+
cells did not initiate tumor formation, whereas Stro-1+ cells showed low tumorigenicity
(Figure 5E). However, while both CD133+ and CD133− populations initiated tumor
formation, CD133+ cells showed stronger tumorigenicity than CD133− cells (Figure 5F).
Given that CD49f− cells can differentiate to both CD49f+ and CD133+ cells (Figures 4A;
5B), and that both the CD49f− and CD133+ subpopulations show greater tumorigenicity
than either CD49f+ or CD133− cells (Figures 4C; 5F), we suggest that the CD49f−CD133+
phenotype serves as a marker for cells with OSIC-like properties.
Strong tumorigenicity of CD49f−CD133+ cells correlates with inhibited osteogenic capacity
To explore OSIC-like CD49f−CD133+ properties, we first asked whether the CD133− and
CD133+ cells share similar traits of multipotency. After culturing CD133+ or CD133− cells
with BDM and FDM for 21 days, we performed ARS and ORO staining for analyzing

osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation. We found that similar to CD49f− or CD49f+ cells,
both osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation were observed in CD133+ and CD133− cells
isolated from either UT2 or KHOS/NP cells (Figure 6A). Because CD49f− cells generate
both CD49f+ and CD133+ subpopulations whereas both CD49f− and CD133+ cells are more
tumorigenic than CD49f+ and CD133− cells, these results suggest that the ability of
multipotent differentiation is preserved in both OSIC-like CD49f−CD133+ cells and their
CD49f+ and CD133− progeny.

Author Manuscript

To test the OSIC-like properties of CD49f−CD133+ cells, we compared the tumorigenicity
of CD49f−CD133+ versus CD49f−CD133− subpopulations of UT2 cells in NOD/SCID mice.
The results showed that with transplantation of 500 cells, tumors were induced at day 17 in 3
of 4 mice given the CD49f−CD133+ cells, whereas tumors were not induced (0/4) in any of
the mice given the CD49f−CD133− cells for up to 6 months (Figure 6B, left panel). HE
staining confirmed that the tumor mass derived from CD49f−CD133+ xenografts (Figure 6B,
middle panel) retained the same properties of the parental U2OS osteosarcoma (Figure 1B).
Importantly, analysis of phenotypic changes in CD49f−CD133+ xenografts showed that
more than 95% of the engrafted cells gained the CD49f+ marker (Figure 6B, right panel), the
hallmark of cells constituting the bulk of osteosarcoma (Figures 1,3,4). Hence,
CD49f−CD133+ cells appear to identify the OSIC-like properties: self-renewal,
osteosarcoma initiation, and differentiation to CD49f+ progeny that form the osteosarcoma
mass. Because the tumorigenicity of transplanted CD49f−CD133+ cells remained less than
100% (Figure 6B, left panel), we conclude that the OSIC-like CD49f−CD133+ subset of
osteosarcoma cells likely coexists with an additional tumorigenic subpopulation(s) within
the CD49f− fraction.

Since multipotency is an accepted classical feature of cancer stem cells (11), we investigated
the potential for bone and fat differentiation by CD49f−CD133+ and CD49f−CD133− cells,
using ARS and ORO staining analyses. Interestingly, while the two fractions had similar
adipogenic capacities (Figure 6C, section 3 vs. 4), the CD49f−CD133+ cells showed reduced
osteogenic differentiation compared to both CD49f−CD133− cells and MSC in the presence
of BDM (Figure 6C, sections 1 vs. 2 and 6). Because this reduction of osteogenic fate in
CD49f−CD133+ cells correlated with an increased rate of tumor production (Figures 6B, left
panel), we investigated osteogenic and adipogenic gene expressions during the transition
from U2OS through the UT2 cells, using microarray analysis. We found that in contrast to
non-inhibition of adipogenic gene expression, osteogenic gene expression was essentially
blocked in UT2 cells compared to U2OS cells (Figure 6D). We further analyzed changes in
the expression of osteogenic and adipogenic target genes in both CD49f− and CD49f+
subpopulations during the transition from U2OS to UT2 cells. qRT-PCR analyses of
osteoblastic differentiation genes, osteopontin (OPN) and osteocalcin (OC), showed that in
contrast to the adipogenic genes PPAR-γ and adipophilin that had only a modest change in
CD49f− and CD49f+ subpopulations, the expression of OPN and OC decreased strikingly
over the same transition (Figure 6E vs. 6F). Hence, these findings suggest that the selfrenewal and tumorigenicity of OSIC properties exhibited by OSIC-like CD49f−CD133+
subpopulation are associated with an inhibited osteogenic potential, in contrast to their
CD49f+ progeny that display limited tumorigenicity with more differentiated osteogenic
feature.

The CD49f−CD133+ phenotype identifies a small fraction of transformed cells in patient
samples of either primary or metastatic osteosarcoma

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Previous studies have suggested that cancer stem cells constitute a small fraction of
transformed cells. They are capable of extensive self-renewal and can repeatedly generate
copious numbers of progeny that ultimately form the bulk of the tumor mass, while the
initial proportion of cancer stem cells remains essentially the same (11). We find that during
the transition from the low tumorigenicity of U2OS cells to the high tumorigenicity of UT2
and UT3 cells, OSIC-like CD49f−CD133+ cells consistently represent a much smaller
proportion of osteosarcoma cells than do their CD49f+ progeny (Figures 4-6). To investigate
whether this phenomenon exists in human osteosarcoma patient samples, we first examined
CD49f− versus CD49f+ versus CD49f−CD133+ populations in TTC444 cells, which were
derived from the primary bone tumor and their earlier passage was proven to have the
tumorigenicity in vivo (Figure 3F; Supplemental Table 2). FACS analysis showed that in
contrast to the 84.5% of cells expressing CD49f, 9.7% and 2.1% expressed CD49f− and
CD49f−CD133+, respectively (Figure 7A). Further to determine such populations in
osteosarcoma tissues, the paired samples from both primary and concordant metastatic
pulmonary sites in 3 osteosarcoma patients were examined with HE staining and
immunohistochemical analysis. The results showed that in contrast to scant expression of
CD133 in both the primary and metastatic sites, a massive CD49f expression was detected in
these tissues (Figure 7B-D, left panels). Because osteosarcoma most commonly metastasizes
to the lungs (3) whereas cancer stem cells are thought to be responsible for establishing
metastasis (38, 39), we examined in these patient tissues whether CD133+ subpopulation
generated by CD49f− cells (Figure 5) co-existed with a subpopulation expressing CXCR4, a
marker identified with metastatic property (38, 40, 41). Immunohistochemical analysis
showed that similar to CD133, CXCR4 was expressed by a small number of localized cells
in either the primary or metastatic site (Figure 7B-D, right panels). Together, these results
demonstrate that OSIC-like CD49f−CD133+ cells consistently represent small proportion of
transformed cells in both the primary and metastatic lesion, whereas CXCR4+ cells could be
a potential tumorigenic subpopulation together with CD49f−CD133+ cells to initiate
osteosarcoma growth and induce metastasis. Moreover, OSFC-like CD49f+ progeny,
making up the tumor bulk whether formed in the primary or metastatic site, could be the
progeny derived from the localized OSIC-like parental population.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

The identity of the cells giving rise to OSFC has been elusive. By defining the lineage
relationship between OSFC and their parental cells using an inverse lineage-tracking
strategy, we determined that the CD49f+ progeny, which constitute the osteosarcoma mass,
are derived from CD49f− or CD49f−CD133+ cells (Figures 4A; 6B, right panel). CD49f
(also called integrin α6) has been used as a CD34-like protein to identify early MSC
progenitors with increased clonogenicity in mice (31). Moreover, studies from Rich's group
found high levels of CD49f expression in surgical biopsy specimens of glioblastoma
multiforme (32). We found that although the expanded CD49f+ progeny shorten the time of
tumor formation (Figures 1, 3), their tumorigenicity and drug resistance are reduced
compared to the same features of their parental CD49f− cells (Figure 4C-G). Thus,

expansion of the CD49f+ population is driven by the enhanced self-renewal of their parental
CD49f− cells, while the limited tumorigenicity of these progeny may be related to
expression of the CD49f marker. CD49f−CD133+ cells appear important because they have
a greater capacity than CD49f− cells to generate CD49f+ OSFC (Figures 6B vs. 4A) and
induce tumors in vivo more readily (75%) than the CD49f− (56%), CD133+ (42%), CD49f+
(44%), CD133− (33%), or CD49f−CD133− (0%) subpopulation (Figures 4C vs. 5F vs. 6B).
Those CD49f−CD133+ cells are consistently found as a small fraction within UT2
xenografts, primary tumors, or metastatic lesions and produce an abundance of more
differentiated CD49f+ progeny (Figures 5-7). Moreover, CD49f−CD133+ cells co-exist with
a small subpopulation expressing CXCR4, a marker possessing metastatic property of
cancer stem cells (38-41), in both the primary and metastatic sites of osteosarcoma patient
samples (Figure 7). Altogether, these findings suggest that CD49f−CD133+ cells possess the
OSIC-like properties of self-renewal and tumorigenicity, and are capable of initiating and
sustaining osteosarcoma growth (Supplemental Figure 3).

The phenotype of cancer stem cells has become increasingly complex, despite the
publication of well-designed and properly executed studies (10, 11, 19). The role of CD133
as a robust marker of cancer stem cells is a case in point (18, 19). In some studies, only
CD133+ cells are able to initiate tumors in vivo, whereas in others CD133– cells also possess
tumor-initiating potential (11, 19, 22, 23). Our analysis demonstrates that whereas
CD49f−CD133+, CD49f−, CD49f+, CD133+, and CD133− subpopulations can all form
osteosarcoma in vivo, CD49f−CD133+ cells possess the strongest tumorigenicity and have a
substantial capacity to differentiate to CD49f+ cells (Figures 4-6). Interestingly, while
CD49f−CD133+ cells retain the capacity for adipogenic differentiation, their strong
tumorigenicity is associated with decreased osteogenic potential (Figure 6B-F). This inverse
relationship is observed during the transition from the low tumorigenicity of U2OS cells to
the high tumorigenicity of UT2 cells induced by serial transplantation (Figure 1), in which
osteogenic but not adipogenic differentiation marker genes are decreased in UT2 or CD49f−
cells (Figure 6D-F). Thus, our studies reveal that the gain of tumorigenicity correlates with a
diminished osteogenic potential in OSIC-like CD49f−CD133+ cells, while the decreased
tumorigenicity of OSFC progeny is associated with more differentiated osteogenic features.
What, then, is the mechanism of the inhibited osteogenic fate of CD49f−CD133+ cells? One
explanation is that CD133 expression promotes the attachment of stem cells to their niche
(18, 19), where they could preserve self-renewal potential by sustaining an aberrant
differentiation program that represses osteogenic potential, as we hypothesize (Supplemental
Figure 3). This hypothesis, although attractive, will require rigorous testing with
CD49f−CD133+ versus CD49f−CD133− cells and more differentiated CD49f+ progeny.

Author Manuscript

Currently, the mechanisms of CD49f−CD133+ contributing to OSIC properties remain
unknown. Several groundbreaking studies with mouse transgenic models have shown the
importance of the Wnt, Hedgehog, Notch, BMI1, and TGF-β pathways in activating and
maintaining cancer stem cells (19, 37, 42, 43). We found that in UT2 cells generated by
serial transplantation (Figure 1), the molecules crucial to mediating Wnt, Notch, and TGF-β
signaling pathways are up-regulated, compared to findings in MSC and/or U2OS cells
(Figure 2B-H). This suggests that in UT2 cells, CD49f−CD133+ subpopulation maintains

these pathways that are known to be associated with cancer stem cells. Hence, determining
such molecular basis for self-renewal of the CD49f−CD133+ cells will be an important step
toward devising targeted therapeutics that inhibit the tumorigenicity of CD49f−CD133+
cells.

Author Manuscript

Recent studies from Iwakuma's group show that by using human osteosarcoma KHOS/NP
(transformed with Kirsten murine sarcoma virus) and MNNG/HOS (transformed with
carcinogenic nitrosamine) cells, both CD117+ and Stro-1+ subpopulations exhibit OSIC
properties, whereas Stro-1 likely contributes more than CD117 (4). We found that neither
CD117+ nor Stro-1+ cells show appreciable tumorigenicity compared to CD133+, CD133−,
CD49f−, CD49f+, or CD49f−CD133+ cells (Figures 5E vs. 4C and 6B). Moreover, whereas
unsorted KHOS/NP cells induced tumor formation (Supplemental Table 1), CD117+CD49+
cells isolated from KHOS/NP cells still lack tumorigenicity (0/4 mice; 500 cells/mouse), in
contrast to the CD117−CD49f− population, which induced tumor formation in 2/4 mice
tested. We suggest that the discrepancies between Iwakuma's work and ours may result from
the differences in cellular background. However, we do not rule out the contribution of the
Stro-1+ marker to the OSIC properties of CD49f−CD133+ cells, as our initial studies indicate
that the Stro-1+ subpopulation isolated from UT2 cells does possess some tumorigenicity.
Further dissection of the CD49f− subpopulation among primary osteosarcoma cells, using a
serial single cell clonogenic assay and human-to-mouse xenotransplantation, should
determine the still-missing counterpart(s) of the OSIC-like CD49f−CD133+ cells, leading to
identifying of OSIC. Such studies could, in turn, point the way to treatments that eradicate
osteosarcoma by expunging its root cause.

Author Manuscript

Our studies show that the gain of strong tumorigenicity, seen with OSIC-like
CD49f−CD133+ cells, correlates with a diminished osteogenic fate. This new phenotype
distinguishes CD49f−CD133+ subpopulation from their progeny, CD49f+ cells, which
compose the bulk of the tumor mass and possess more differentiated osteogenic features
with limited tumorigenicity. Moreover, CD49f+ progeny remain capable of inducing
osteosarcoma in vivo. This finding provides new insight that may help to resolve the current
controversy over whether some daughter cells or marker-negative counterpart
subpopulations of cancer stem cells possess limited tumorigenicity in vivo. Hence, these
studies advance our understanding of cancer stem cell properties and suggest new
approaches to targeted therapy in patients with osteosarcoma.

(A) Self-renewal and tumorigenicity were assessed by the amount of cells injected and the
time of tumor formation. Cells from the first U2OS xenograft were re-transplanted to yield
the 1st, 2nd and 3rd generations of U2OS cells (designated as UT1, UT2, and UT3). (B) HE
staining determined that UT2 cells retained histological features of U2OS cells, as reflected
by cellular polymorphism, nuclear hyperchromasia, and mitotic activities, together with
osteoid formation that recapitulated the hallmark histological phenotype of the parental
osteosarcoma. (C) UT2 cells remained capable of tumorigenicity in the bone. Tumor
formation occurred in the right legs of mice with injection of UT2 cells (section ii). (D) HE
staining of osteosarcoma xenograft formed in the femurs of the right legs (panel C), focally

Figure 5. CD49f− cells generate the CD133+ subpopulation

Author Manuscript

(A) FACS analyses of frequencies of the CD49f−CD133+, CD49f−CD133−,
CD49f+CD133+, and CD49f+CD133− subpopulations in UT2 cells. (B) CD49f− cells
differentiated to CD133+ subpopulation (27.8%) after 14 days of culture from basal level of
7.4% in UT2 cells, compared to CD49f+ cells with a slight increase (8.4%). (C & D)
CD117+ (panel C) and Stro-1+ (panel D) subpopulations remained essentially unchanged
after culture of CD49f+ or CD49f− cells for 14 days. (E) CD117+ cells failed to initiate
tumor formation and Stro-1+ cells showed low tumorigenicity. (F) CD133+ cells showed
higher tumorigenicity than CD133− cells.

Figure 6. Strong tumorigenicity of CD49f−CD133+ cells correlates with inhibited osteogenic
capacity

Author Manuscript

(A) Both CD133+ and CD133− subpopulations of UT2 (left panel) or KHOS/PN cells (right
panel) displayed osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation, as judged by ARS and ORO
staining. (B) CD49f−CD133+ cells but not CD49f−CD133− cells formed tumors in NOD/
SCID mice (left panel); HE staining of CD49f−CD133+ xenograft cells showed the
histological features of U2OS cells with osteoid (extra-cellular matrix) formation, as
reflected by spindle cells with a vesicular nucleus often containing prominent nucleoli,
frequent mitotic activities, and focal areas of osteoid formation (middle panel); engrafted
CD49f−CD133+ cells differentiated to CD49f+ cells in mice (right panel). (C) While both
CD49f−CD133+ and CD49f−CD133− cells showed a similar capacity for fat differentiation
(sections 3 and 4), CD49f−CD133+ cells showed a reduced potential for bone differentiation,
compared to CD49f−CD133− cells and MSC (sections 1 vs. 2 and 6). (D) Microarray
analysis revealed a decreased expression of osteogenic marker genes in UT2 cells. (E & F)
qRT-PCR analysis of osteogenic (panel E) and adipogenic marker gene expressions (panel
F) in CD49f− and CD49f+ subpopulations.

Figure 7. The OSIC-like CD49f−CD133+ phenotype identifies a small fraction of transformed
cells in patient samples of either primary or metastatic osteosarcoma

(A) FACS analysis of CD49f−CD133+ versus CD49f+ cells in TTC444 cells. Ab, antibody.
(B-D) HE staining of the paired tissue samples from both primary and concordant metastatic
pulmonary sites in 3 osteosarcoma patients. Parallel immunohistochemical assay detected
the expression of CD49f, CD133, and CXCR4 in these samples.
