Abstract
15(S)-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid [15(S)-HETE] activated
signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) as
measured by its tyrosine phosphorylation, translocation from
the cytoplasm to the nucleus, DNA binding, and reporter gene
activity in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells
(HDMVEC). Inhibition of STAT3 activation via adenovirusmediated expression of its dominant-negative mutant suppressed 15(S)-HETE–induced HDMVEC migration and tube
formation in vitro and aortic ring and Matrigel plug angiogenesis in vivo. 15(S)-HETE induced the expression of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in a time- and STAT3dependent manner in HDMVEC. In addition, neutralizing antiVEGF antibodies blocked 15(S)-HETE–induced HDMVEC
migration and tube formation in vitro and aortic ring and
Matrigel plug angiogenesis in vivo. Together, these results
show for the first time that 15(S)-HETE–induced angiogenesis
requires STAT3-dependent expression of VEGF. In view of
these findings, it is suggested that eicosanoids, particularly
15(S)-HETE, via its capacity to stimulate angiogenesis, may
influence the progression of cancer and vascular disease.

Introduction
Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is an adaptive
phenomenon to meet the tissue/cellular requirement for oxygen/
nutrients and thus plays an important role in development and
wound healing (1, 2). Angiogenesis also plays a prominent role in
the progression of cancer and vascular diseases such as
atherosclerosis and restenosis (3–5). A large body of data indicates
that lipoxygenases (LOX) are involved in the development of
various types of cancers (6–9). It is known that oxidation of lowdensity lipoprotein (LDL) is a contributing factor in the
pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (10, 11). In addition, many studies
have shown that LOX, particularly 15-LOX, via its role in the
oxidation of LDL, is also involved in the pathogenesis of
atherosclerosis (12, 13). Furthermore, accumulated evidence
suggests a role for LOX in restenosis as well (14). Towards
understanding the mechanisms underlying the involvement of LOX
in the pathogenesis of cancer and vascular diseases, it was reported
that 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid [12(S)-HETE], the 12-LOX
product of arachidonic acid, influences the growth and/or motility
of cancer and vascular smooth muscle cells (15, 16). Similarly,
12(S)-HETE has been shown to stimulate angiogenesis (17). With

regard to the role of other LOX and their products in the
pathogenesis of the above mentioned diseases, it was shown that
15-LOX1, while inhibiting colorectal cancer cell growth (18, 19),
stimulated prostate cancer cell growth (7, 8, 20). In contrast, 15LOX2 inhibited prostate cancer growth (21). 15-LOX1, while
preferentially converting linoleic acid to 13(S)-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid [13(S)-HODE], also metabolizes arachidonic acid to
15(S)-HETE and 12(S)-HETE (22). On the other hand, 15-LOX2
mainly converts arachidonic acid to 15(S)-HETE (22). However,
only 13(S)-HODE mimicked the 15-LOX1 effects on the inhibition
of colorectal cancer cell growth (18, 19). With regard to 15(S)HETE, the arachidonic acid product of 15-LOX2, it exhibited
proangiogenic activity in endothelial cells (23) and enhanced the
growth of some cancer cell types such as erythroid cells (6). Thus,
15-LOX1/2 and their products 13(S)-HODE and 15(S)-HETE
exhibited differential effects in different cancer cell types. Because
15(S)-HETE induced growth in some cancer cell types, and because
its levels have been found increased in atherosclerosis (24), earlier,
we attempted to understand the possible mechanisms by which
this eicosanoid influences cancer and vessel wall diseases and
showed that it stimulates angiogenesis (25). In addition, we have
shown that 15(S)-HETE–induced angiogenesis depends on activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/S6K1 signaling.
The Janus-activated kinase/signal transducer and activator of
transcription (Jak/STAT) signaling plays an important role in the
regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and migration (26–29).
Using pharmacologic approach, the involvement for the Jak/STAT
pathway in the vessel wall diseases has also been reported (30). In
addition, it was shown that STAT3 plays a role in angiogenesis in
response to various stimulants (31, 32). To unravel the signaling
mechanisms by which 15(S)-HETE influences angiogenesis, and
thereby cancer and vascular diseases, here, we have extended our
studies to examine the role of the Jak/STAT pathway. In the present
communication, we report for the first time that 15(S)-HETE
activates STAT3 in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells
(HDMVEC). In addition, our results show that 15(S)-HETE–induced
angiogenesis requires STAT3-dependent expression and release of
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

VEGF Mediates 15(S)-HETE–Induced Angiogenesis
FuGENE 6 transfection reagent was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. D-threo-[dichloroacetyl-1-14C] chloramphenicol (59 mCi/mmol)
was from Amersham Biosciences. [g 32 P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) was bought
from NEN Life Science Products. All the primers were made by IDT.
Cell culture. HDMVEC were bought from Cascade Biologics. Cells were
grown in medium 131 containing microvascular growth supplements
(MVGS), 10 Ag/mL gentamicin, and 0.25 Ag/mL amphotericin B. Cultures
were maintained at 37jC in a humidified 95% air and 5% CO2 atmosphere.
Cells were quiesced by incubating in medium 131 for 24 h and used to
perform the experiments unless otherwise indicated.
Cell migration assay Cell migration was done using a modified Boyden
Chamber method as described by Nagata et al. (33). The cell culture inserts
containing membranes with 10 mm in diameter and 8.0 Am pore size (Nalge
Nunc International) were placed in a 24-well tissue culture plate (Costar,
Corning, Inc.). The lower surface of the porous membrane was coated with
0.5% gelatin at 4jC overnight and then blocked with 0.1% heat-inactivated
bovine serum albumin (BSA) at 37jC for 1 h. HDMVEC were quiesced for
24 h in medium 131, trypsinized, and neutralized with TNS. Cells were
seeded into the upper chamber at 1  105 per well. Vehicle or 15(S)-HETE
were added to the lower chamber at the indicated concentration. Both the
upper and lower chambers contained medium 131. When the effect of
dominant-negative STAT3 (dnSTAT3) mutant was tested on 15(S)-HETE–
induced HDMVEC migration, cells were infected first with either Ad-GFP or
Ad-dnSTAT3 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 80 and quiesced before
they were subjected to migration assay. Ser727 and Tyr705 were mutated to
Ala and Phe, respectively, to construct the dnSTAT3 (28). In the case of
testing the effect of neutralizing anti-VEGF antibodies on 15(S)-HETE–
induced HDMVEC migration, cells were incubated with antibodies (3 Ag/
mL) for 30 min at 37jC and washed with medium 131. Cells were then
seeded into each well, and wherever appropriate, the antibodies were added
to both the upper and lower chambers before the addition of 15(S)-HETE.
After 6 h of incubation at 37jC, non-migrated cells were removed from the
upper side of the membrane with cotton swabs, and the cells on the lower
surface of the membrane were fixed in methanol for 15 min. The membrane
was then stained with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole in Vectashield
mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) and observed under
deconvolution fluorescence microscope. Cells were counted in five
randomly selected squares per well and presented as number of migrated
cells per field.
Tube formation assay. Tube formation assay was done as described by
Nagata et al. (33). Twenty-four–well culture plates (Costar, Corning) were
coated with growth factor–reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) in a total
volume of 280 Al per well and allowed to solidify for 30 min at 37jC.
HDMVEC were trypsinized, neutralized with TNS, and resuspended at 5 
105/mL, and 200 AL of this cell suspension was added into each well. Vehicle
or eicosanoid of interest, at the indicated concentration were added to the
appropriate well, and the cells were incubated at 37jC for 6 h. When the
effect of dnSTAT3 mutant was tested on 15(S)-HETE–induced HDMVEC
tube formation, cells were infected first with either Ad-GFP or Ad-dnSTAT3
at a MOI of 80 and quiesced before they were subjected to tube formation.
In the case of testing the effect of neutralizing anti-VEGF antibodies on
15(S)-HETE–induced HDMVEC tube formation, cells were incubated with
antibodies (3 Ag/mL) for 30 min at 37jC and washed with medium 131.
Cells were then seeded into each well, and wherever appropriate, the
antibodies were added to the well before the addition of 15(S)-HETE. Tube
formation was observed under an inverted microscope (Model Eclipse
TS100, Nikon). Images were captured with a CCD color camera (Model KPD20AU, Hitachi) attached to the microscope, and tube length was measured
using the NIH Image J 1.31v Program.
Western blot analysis. After appropriate treatments and rinsing with
cold PBS, HDMVEC were lysed in 500 AL of lysis buffer (PBS, 1% NP40, 0.5%
sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 Ag/mL PMSF, 100 Ag/mL aprotinin,
1 Ag/mL leupeptin, and 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate) and scraped into
1.5-mL Eppendorf tubes. After standing on ice for 20 min, the cell lysates
were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4jC. Cell lysates
containing equal amount of protein were resolved by electrophoresis on
0.1% SDS and 10% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred

electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond, Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech). After blocking in 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0)
containing 150 mmol/L sodium chloride, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% (w/v)
nonfat dry milk, the membrane was treated with appropriate primary
antibodies followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated
secondary antibodies. The antigen-antibody complexes were detected using
chemiluminescence reagent kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. After appropriate treatments,
nuclear extracts were prepared from HDMVEC as described previously (27).
The protein content of the nuclear extracts was determined using a Micro
BCA Protein Assay Reagent kit (Pierce). Protein-DNA complexes were
formed by incubating 5 Ag of nuclear protein in a total volume of 20 AL
consisting of 15 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9), 3 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.9),
60 mmol/L KCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L PMSF, 1 mmol/L DTT,
2.5 Ag/mL of BSA, 1 Ag/mL of poly(deoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic acid), 15%
glycerol, and 100,000 cpm of [32P]-labeled oligonucleotide probe for 30 min
on ice. To find the presence of STAT3 in the protein-DNA complexes, the
nuclear extracts were preincubated with anti-STAT3 antibodies (0.5 Ag per
reaction) for 30 min on ice before the addition of the labeled probe to it.
The protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on a 4%
polyacrylamide gel using 1 Tris-glycine-EDTA buffer [25 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 8.5), 200 mmol/L glycine, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA]. Double-stranded
oligonucleotides were labeled with [g 32P]ATP using the T4 polynucleotide
kinase kit (Promega) following the supplier’s protocol.
CAT assay. HDMVEC were plated evenly onto 100-mm dishes and grown
in medium 131 supplemented with MVGS and G/A. At 50% to 80%
confluence, medium was replaced with medium 131, and cells were
transfected with pSIE-CAT plasmid using FuGENE 6 reagent according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche Diagnostics). The pSIE-CAT plasmid
contains three copies of sis-inducible elements (equivalent to GAS) from the
IRF-1 gene (kindly provided by Dr. H. Young, National Cancer InstituteFrederick Research Cancer and Development Center, Frederick, MD).
Twelve hours after transfection in medium 131, cells were quiesced for
24 h and treated with and without 15(S)-HETE (0.1 Amol/L) for the
indicated time periods, and cell extracts were prepared. Wherever the effect
of dnSTAT3 mutant was tested on 15(S)-HETE–induced CAT activity, cells
were first infected with either Ad-GFP or Ad-dnSTAT3 at a MOI of 80
followed by transfection with pSIE-CAT plasmid DNA. HDMVEC extracts
were normalized for protein and assayed for CAT activity using
[14C]chloramphenicol and acetyl-CoA as substrates. The substrate and
products were extracted with ethyl acetate, separated by TLC, and
subjected to autoradiography.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was done on HDMVEC by using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit following supplier’s protocol (Upstate Biotechnology).
STAT3-DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated using anti-STAT3 antibody (SC-482, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Preimmune serum (SC-2338) was
used as a negative control. Precipitated DNA was extracted using phenolchloroform, and the DNA fragments from the aqueous phase were purified
using QIAquick columns (Qiagen). The purified DNA was used as a template
for PCR amplification using primers ( forward, 5¶-TTGGTGCCAAATTCTTCTCC-3¶; reverse, 5¶-CATACGTCCTCACTCTCGAA-3¶) flanking the putative
STAT-binding site located at 848 in human VEGF promoter region (34).
The PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose gel and stained with
ethidium bromide.
Rat aortic ring assay. Rat aortic ring assay was done as described
previously by Masson et al. (35). Briefly, male Fischer-344 rats (age 8–12
weeks) were sacrificed with cervical dislocation. The thoracic aorta was
immediately removed and placed in cold DMEM. The periaortic
fibroadipose tissue was carefully removed with fine microdissecting forceps
and iridectomy scissors without damaging the aortic wall. One-millimeterlong aortic rings were sectioned and extensively rinsed in DMEM. To study
the role of STAT3 on microvessel formation, the aortic rings were first
incubated with adenovirus [5  109 plaque-forming units (pfu)/mL]
expressing dnSTAT3 in incomplete medium 131 for 6 h at 37jC in 95% air/
5% CO2 incubator. Rings were then embedded in rat tail interstitial collagen
gel (1.5 mg/mL) prepared by mixing 7.5 volumes of 2 mg/mL collagen,

1 volume of 10 MEM, and 1.5 volume of NaHCO3 (15.6 mg/mL, pH 7.4).
Three milliliters of medium 131 with and without containing 0.1 Amol/L
15(S)-HETE was then added into each well. To test the effect of neutralizing
anti-VEGF antibodies, the rings were incubated with and without 15(S)HETE (0.25 Amol/L) in the presence and absence of 3 Ag/mL of antibodies.
The microvessel formation was observed 7 days after incubation under the
Nikon Eclipse 50i microscope at 4 magnification equipped with a camera.
The length and number of microvessels formed were evaluated as a degree
of angiogenesis using ImageJ software (NIH).
Matrigel plug angiogenesis assay. Matrigel plug assay was done
essentially as described by Medhora et al. (36). C57BL/6 mice (8 weeks old)
were lightly anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, i.p.) and
injected s.c. with 0.5 mL of Matrigel that was premixed with vehicle or
50 Amol/L 15(S)-HETE along the dorsal midline (due to its highly labile
characteristic feature, one higher bolus dose of 15(S)-HETE was added to
the Matrigel to facilitate its continuous availability over a period of several
days). The injection was made rapidly with a B-D 26G1/2 needle to ensure
the entire content was delivered as a single plug. Wherever the effect of AdGFP, Ad-dnSTAT3 (5  109 pfu/mL), or neutralizing anti-VEGF antibodies
(3 mg/mL) were tested on 15(S)-HETE–induced angiogenesis, they were
added to the Matrigel before injecting into mice. The mice were allowed to
recover, and 7 days later, unless otherwise stated, the animals were
sacrificed by inhalation of CO2, and the Matrigel plugs were harvested from
underneath the skin. The plugs were homogenized in 1 mL of deionized
water on ice and cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 6 min at 4jC.
The supernatant was collected and used in duplicate to measure
hemoglobin content with Drabkin’s reagent along with hemoglobin
standard essentially according to the manufacturer’s protocol (SigmaChemical). The absorbance was read at 540 nm in an ELISA plate reader
(Spectra Max 190, Molecular Devices). These experiments were repeated at
least thrice with four mice for each group, and the values are expressed as
g/dL of hemoglobin/mg plug.
VEGF ELISA. VEGF released into the culture media was measured using
an ELISA kit following the manufacturer’s instructions (Pierce).
Statistics. All the experiments were repeated thrice, with a similar
pattern of results. Data are presented as mean F SD. The treatment effects
were analyzed by Student’s t test, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant. In the case of CAT assay, electrophoretic mobility shift assay
(EMSA), and Western blotting, one representative set of data is shown.

fractions, a result that confirms the purity of the cytoplasmic and
nuclear preparations. Furthermore, sequential reprobing of the
membrane with anti-STAT3 antibodies indicated that the majority
of STAT3 was present in the cytoplasm, and only a small fraction of
it was phosphorylated in response to 15(S)-HETE (Fig. 1B).
To test whether the increased translocation of STAT3 also leads
to its increased DNA binding activity, an equal amount of nuclear
protein from control and 0.1 Amol/L 15(S )-HETE–treated
HDMVEC was analyzed for DNA binding activity using [32P]labeled STAT3 consensus oligonucleotides as a probe. A timedependent increase in STAT3 DNA binding activity was observed in
response to 15(S)-HETE treatment (Fig. 2A). Preincubation of
nuclear extract with anti-STAT3 antibodies (0.5 Ag) reduced STAT3
DNA binding activity by 80% (Fig. 2A). In addition to the major
prominent upper band, depending upon the exposure time of the
X-ray film to the gel, a faint lower band was observed in some
EMSA, which indicates the possible heterodimers of STAT3 with
other members of the STAT family of transcriptional factors. These
results confirm the presence of STAT3 in 15(S)-HETE–induced
protein-DNA complexes. To find whether the increased DNA
binding activity correlates with its ability of transcriptional
transactivation, cells were transfected with pSIE-CAT reporter
gene plasmid DNA in which the transcription of the CAT gene is
regulated by three copies of sis-inducing elements, quiesced, and
treated with and without 15(S)-HETE for various time periods. Cell
extracts were prepared and analyzed for CAT activity using
[14C]chloramphenicol and acetyl-CoA as substrates. A timedependent increase in STAT3 reporter gene activity was observed
in response to 15(S)-HETE (Fig. 2B). To confirm these results, we
also studied the effect of dnSTAT3. HDMVEC were infected with
Ad-GFP or Ad-dnSTAT3 with a MOI of 80, quiesced, and treated

15(S)-HETE activates STAT3 in HDMVEC. To elucidate the
mechanisms of 15(S)-HETE–induced angiogenesis, we have studied
the role of STAT3. Quiescent HDMVEC were treated with and
without 15(S)-HETE (0.1 Amol/L) for the indicated times, and an
equal amount of protein from each treatment was analyzed for
phosphorylated STAT3 using its phosphospecific antibodies. 15(S)HETE stimulated tyrosine (Tyr705) phosphorylation of STAT3 in
a time-dependent manner with about 2-fold increase at 1 min
(Fig. 1A). 15(S)-HETE–induced STAT3 phosphorylation sustained
for 1 h. Upon phosphorylation, STATs form homodimers or
heterodimers with other members of their family and translocate
from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where they bind to promoter
regions and influence the gene transcription (37). To study STAT3
translocation, cells were treated with and without 15(S)-HETE
(0.1 Amol/L) for various time periods, and the cytoplasmic and
nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed for phosphorylated
STAT3 levels as described above. Phosphorylated STAT3 was
detected only in the nuclear fractions of both control and treated
cells, and its levels were found 2-fold higher in 15(S)-HETE–treated
cells compared with untreated cells (Fig. 1B). To confirm the
nuclear translocation of STAT3, the blot was reprobed with antip53 antibodies. As expected, p53 was found only in the nuclear

using its phosphospecific antibodies. The blot in (A ) was reprobed with
anti-STAT3 antibodies for normalization. For testing the purity of cytoplasmic
and nuclear preparations, the blot in (B ) was reprobed sequentially with
anti-STAT3 and anti-p53 antibodies.

stimulated HDMVEC cell migration by about 2-fold as measured by
the modified Boyden chamber method, and adenovirus-mediated
expression of dnSTAT3 attenuated this effect (Fig. 4A). Similarly,
15(S)-HETE induced HDMVEC tube formation by about 2-fold, and
this effect was also found to be STAT3 dependent as adenovirusmediated expression of its dominant-negative mutant inhibited
this activity (Fig. 4B). To obtain additional evidence for the role of
STAT3 in 15(S)-HETE–induced angiogenesis, we used the aortic

without 15(S)-HETE (0.1 Amol/L) for the indicated times, and nuclear extracts
were prepared. The nuclear extracts containing an equal amount of protein
from control and each treatment were assayed for STAT3 DNA binding activity
using its [32P]-labeled consensus double-stranded oligonucleotides as a probe.
To detect the presence of STAT3 in the protein-DNA complex, the nuclear
proteins of control and 15(S)-HETE–treated HDMVEC were preincubated with
anti-STAT3 antibodies (1 Ag) and subjected to STAT3 DNA binding reaction.
B, HDMVEC were transfected with pSIE-CAT plasmid DNA (3 Ag per dish),
quiesced, and treated with and without 15(S)-HETE (0.1 Amol/L) for the indicated
times, and cell extracts were prepared and assayed for CAT activity using
[14C]chloramphenicol and acetyl-CoA as substrates.

with and without 15(S)-HETE (0.1 Amol/L) for 1 h. Nuclear extracts
were prepared and analyzed for STAT3 DNA binding activity as
described above. Adenovirus-mediated expression of dnSTAT3
significantly inhibited 15(S)-HETE–induced STAT3 DNA binding
activity (Fig. 3A). In case of testing the effect of dnSTAT3 on 15(S)HETE–induced STAT3 reporter gene activity, after infection with
either Ad-GFP or Ad-dnSTAT3, cells were transfected with pSIECAT plasmid DNA, quiesced, and treated with and without 15(S)HETE (0.1 Amol/L) for 6 h. Cell extracts were prepared and
analyzed for CAT activity. Adenovirus-mediated expression of
dnSTAT3 also inhibited 15(S)-HETE–induced STAT3 reporter gene
activity by 60% (Fig. 3B and C).
STAT3 mediates 15(S)-HETE–induced HDMVEC migration

ELISA. C, conditions were the same as in (A) except that cells were transduced first with Ad-GFP or Ad-dnSTAT3 with a MOI of 80 and quiesced before they were

ring and Matrigel plug angiogenesis models. As shown in Fig. 4C,
15(S)-HETE at 0.1 Amol/L concentration stimulated the sprouting
and elongation of microvessels from the aortic ring explants. In
addition, preincubation of aortic rings with Ad-dnSTAT3 (5  109
pfu/mL) substantially attenuated 15(S)-HETE–induced aortic ring
angiogenesis (Fig. 4C). Similarly, 15(S)-HETE (50 Amol/L) induced
Matrigel plug angiogenesis, and dnSTAT3 significantly inhibited
this effect (Fig. 4D).
15(S)-HETE–induced angiogenic activities are dependent on
STAT3-mediated VEGF expression. It was reported that STAT3
mediates VEGF expression in response to some angiogenic
stimulants (38, 39). To find whether 15(S)-HETE induces the
expression of VEGF, and if so, the role of STAT3, quiescent

HDMVEC were treated with and without 15(S)-HETE (0.1 Amol/L)
for the indicated times, and cell extracts were prepared. An equal
amount of protein from control and treatment was then analyzed
by Western blotting for VEGF using its specific antibodies. As
shown in Fig. 5A, 15(S)-HETE induced the expression of VEGF in a
time-dependent manner with a maximum 3-fold increase at 6 h,
and these levels were sustained for at least 24 h. Similarly, 15(S)HETE induced the release of VEGF into the culture medium in a
time-dependent manner with a maximum of 3-fold effect at 6 h
(Fig. 5B). Blockade of STAT3 by adenovirus-mediated expression of
its dominant-negative mutant significantly blunted the 15(S)HETE–induced VEGF expression and its release (Fig. 5C and D).

VEGF Mediates 15(S)-HETE–Induced Angiogenesis

of a putative STAT binding motif spanning from 848 to 841 (34).
To obtain additional evidence for the role of STAT3 in 15(S)-HETE–
induced VEGF expression, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis was done using human VEGF promoter–specific primers
flanking the putative STAT-binding motif. As shown in Fig. 6,
STAT3 binds to VEGF promoter in vivo in a time-dependent
manner in response to 15(S)-HETE treatment. This result provides
the direct evidence for the role of STAT3 in 15(S)-HETE–induced
VEGF expression. To test the role of VEGF in 15(S)-HETE–induced
angiogenesis, we next studied the effect of neutralizing anti-VEGF
antibodies on 15(S)-HETE–induced HDMVEC migration and
tube formation. Addition of neutralizing anti-VEGF antibodies
(3 Ag/mL) completely suppressed 15(S)-HETE–induced HDMVEC
migration and tube formation (Fig. 7A and B). Neutralizing antiVEGF antibodies also inhibited 15(S)-HETE–induced aortic ring
and Matrigel plug angiogenesis (Fig. 7C and D).

Discussion
The major findings of the present study are as follows: (a) 15(S)HETE, the 15-LOX product of arachidonic acid, stimulates STAT3
in a time-dependent manner in HDMVEC. (b) 15(S)-HETE induced
the expression of VEGF in STAT3-dependent manner. (c) 15(S)HETE–induced angiogenesis requires STAT3-mediated expression
and release of VEGF. Two 15-LOX (i.e., 15-LOX1 and 15-LOX2) have
been reported in humans and both produce 15(S)-HETE from
arachidonic acid as a major product (22, 38). However, both 15LOX1 and 15-LOX2 have been reported to exert different effects in
different cell types. It was shown that 15-LOX1, while inhibiting the
growth of colorectal cancer cells (18, 19), stimulated prostate
cancer cell growth (7, 8, 20). On the other hand, 15-LOX2 inhibited
the growth of prostate cancer cells (21). Despite these differential
effects of 15-LOX1 and 15-LOX2, their arachidonic acid product
15(S)-HETE influences growth in many other cell types including
endothelial cells (6, 39). Towards understanding the possible
mechanisms by which 15-LOX plays a role in cancer and vascular
diseases, previously, we have shown that 15(S)-HETE induces
angiogenesis (25). In the present study, we investigated the role of
STAT3 in 15(S)-HETE–induced angiogenesis. STAT3 has been
shown to be involved in the regulation of growth in various cell
types in response to different growth factors and cytokines (26, 27,
40–44). In addition, numerous studies have shown that STAT3
mediates stimulant-induced angiogenesis (31, 32). In this aspect,
the present results show that 15(S)-HETE also activates STAT3 in
inducing angiogenesis.
VEGF plays a crucial role in endothelial cell growth and motility,
thereby in angiogenesis (1, 2). In addition, VEGF seems to be a

major mediator of angiogenesis in response to several stimulants
(31, 38, 39, 45). Interestingly, 15(S)-HETE–induced angiogenesis
also requires VEGF expression, and this response is dependent on
activation of STAT3. This conclusion is supported by the
observations that STAT3 binds to VEGF promoter in vivo in
response to 15(S)-HETE treatment, and blockade of STAT3
activation inhibits 15(S)-HETE–induced VEGF expression in
HDMVEC as well as the migration and tube formation of these
cells. Similarly, neutralizing anti-VEGF antibodies significantly
inhibited 15(S)-HETE–induced HDMVEC migration and tube
formation in vitro as well as aortic ring and Matrigel plug
angiogenesis in vivo. In lieu of these findings, it seems that 15(S)HETE mimics other angiogenic stimulants, such as hypoxia and
interleukin-8, in activating STAT3-VEGF signaling in endothelial
cells (38, 39). Earlier, we have also reported that activation of PI3/
Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/S6K1 is required for
15(S)-HETE–induced angiogenesis (25). Because the inhibition of
either the PI3/Akt/mTOR/S6K1 or STAT3 signaling resulted in
almost complete suppression of 15(S)-HETE–induced angiogenesis,
it is possible that these two signaling pathways play stage-specific
events of angiogenesis. It was reported that PI3K/AKT signaling
plays an important role in the sprouting of endothelial cells
(46, 47). On the other hand, VEGF is needed for the survival and
maintenance of the plasticity of the vessel (48, 49). Therefore,
activation of both PI3K/Akt/S6K1 and STAT3 signaling may be
necessary to perform different aspects of 15(S)-HETE–induced
angiogenesis. If this was the case, then one would expect an equally
important role for both signaling events in 15(S)-HETE–induced
angiogenesis and inhibition of either one would result in the
disruption of this process.
15-LOX has been shown to play a role in atherosclerosis via
oxidation of LDL (12, 13). In addition, increased levels of 15(S)HETE, the 15-LOX product of arachidonic acid, were reported in
atherosclerosis (24). Furthermore, angiogenesis has been shown to
influence the plaque progression (4, 5). Therefore, the production
of 15(S)-HETE and its capacity to induce angiogenesis may also
exert a positive effect on the progression of atherosclerosis.
In brief, the present results provide new insights on the possible
mechanisms by which 15-LOX/15(S)-HETE could influence the
progression of cancer and vascular diseases.
