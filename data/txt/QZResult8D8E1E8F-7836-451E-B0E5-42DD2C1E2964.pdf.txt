ABSTRACT
The prognostic role of Extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN/
CD147) in gastrointestinal cancer remains controversial. We systematically reviewed
the evidence of assessment of CD147 expression in gastrointestinal cancer to
help clarify this issue. Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science
databases were searched to identify eligible studies to evaluate the association of
CD147 expression and disease-free and overall survival of gastrointestinal cancer.
Hazard ratios (HRs) were pooled to estimate the effect. CD147 overexpression was
significantly correlated with poor disease-free survival (HR 2.38, 95% CI 1.43–3.97)
and overall survival (HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.25–2.14) of cancer patients. Furthermore,
CD147 overexpression was significantly association with TNM stage (TIII/TIV vs
TI/TII: OR 3.60, 95% CI 1.85–7.01), the depth of invasion (T3/T4 vs T1/T2: OR
2.04, 95% CI 1.25–3.33), lymph node metastasis (positive vs negative: 2.35, 95% CI
1.14–4.86), distant metastasis (positive vs negative: OR 4.78, 95% CI 1.43–16.00).
Our analyses demonstrate that CD147 was effectively predictive of worse prognosis
in gastrointestinal cancer. Moreover, Identifying CD147 may help identify new drug
targets for cancer therapy.

Several molecular markers, such as matrix
metalloproteinase (MMPs), vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF), E-cadherin, and epidermal growth
factor, have been proven to associate with prognosis for
carcinoma patients [3–6]. Among the biomarkers, the
expression of extracellular matrix metalloproteinase
inducer (CD147) has attracted interest. CD147 is one
of cell glycoprotein of immunoglobulin super family.
It is highly expressed in malignant carcinomas and is
a prognosis marker of cancer progression [7]. CD147
arouses normal cells to express MMPs, which are a group
of zinc-dependent proteins that degrade the expression
of extracellular matrix (ECM) [8, 9]. Low expression
of the ECM surrounding primary tumors is essential for
carcinoma invasion and metastasis [8].

INTRODUCTION
Gastrointestinal cancers are the main malignant
tumors in both men and women worldwide [1, 2].
Although progression has been made in its diagnosis and
treatment, some gastrointestinal cancers are still incurable.
This is largely because most patients are at an advanced
stage at the time of diagnosis, so have a correspondingly
poor prognosis. Disease prognosis correlates directly
with the incidence of carcinoma relapse, which is mainly
caused by early metastasis. Therefore, the prediction
of tumor relapse and the prevention of early metastasis
is a promising therapy for gastrointestinal cancer. It is
therefore very important to confirm prognostic markers
for gastrointestinal cancer which can help identify better
preventive methods for gastrointestinal cancer patients.

The association between CD147 and survival in
gastrointestinal cancer

As well as the important function of CD147 in
tumor progression, its role in carcinoma invasiveness
was also identified in several malignancies. Some reports
demonstrated that CD147 expression was correlated with
the prognosis of various human carcinomas [10–15].
CD147 has also been reported to be associated with
tumor progression, metastasis, relapse, and prognosis
of gastrointestinal carcinoma [16–22]. However, not
all findings are consistent. Meta-analysis is a powerful
method that overcomes the deficiency of small sample
sizes of a individual centre [23]. Thus, we perform the
meta-analysis to evaluate the prognostic significance of
CD147 in gastrointestinal cancer.

CD147 in gastrointestinal cancer tissues was shown
to be significantly associated with poor overall survival of
cancer patients (combined HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.25–2.14).
Subgroup analysis by malignant disease also revealed
a significant relationship between CD147 and overall
survival in gastric cancer (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.11–1.85)
and colorectal cancer (HR 1.93, 95% CI 1.17–3.20)
(Figure 2).
We also assessed the association between CD147
and disease-free survival in gastrointestinal cancer. As
shown in Figure 3, CD147 expression in gastrointestinal
cancer tissues was associated with poor disease-free
survival of gastrointestinal cancer (combined HR 2.38,
95% CI 1.43–3.97). Moreover, subgroup analysis showed
a significant relationship between CA147 and diseasefree survival in both gastric carcinoma (HR 1.63, 95% CI
1.13–2.36) and colorectal carcinoma (HR 3.18, 95% CI
2.02–5.02).

RESULTS
Study selection and characteristics
A total of 213 researches were retrieved by the
search strategies described. After browsing the abstract
and full-text, seven studies were into meta-analysis. All
studies met the inclusion criteria and quality assessment
standard. The selection process is shown in Figure 1,
and the main characteristics of the seven studies are
summarized in Table 1. Three studies were of gastric
cancer, and four were of colorectal cancer. Three studies
evaluated patients from China one from Korea, one from
Norway, one from Germany,, and one from Japan. The
seven studies consisted of a total of 1,993 patients, with
sample sizes varying from 210 to 436 patients.

The association between CD147 and clinical
features
We next assessed the association between CD147
and clinical characteristic s of gastrointestinal carcinoma.
As shown in the forest plots, CD147 was significantly
associated with TNM stage (TIII/TIV vs TI/TII: combined
OR 3.60, 95% CI 1.85–7.01) (Figure 4), depth of invasion

DISCUSSION

retrieved from reported studies, we did not find any major
deviation of results when comparing our calculated HR
with the statistical significance of the study itself. Third,
only a small number of included patients were enrolled
in our meta-analysis compared with other meta-analyses.
Therefore, further study about CD147 is essential to
indentify the prognostic role of CD147.
Because of the significant heterogeneity of the
enrolled studies, we adopted random effects models
when pooling data. Subgroup analysis revealed that the
heterogeneity may be due to the difference in malignant
disease. The features of cancers might differ based on
diverse tumor locations. We conducted subgroup analysis
according to malignant disease, and the pooled analysis of
gastric cancer and colorectal cancer indicated that the high
expression of CD147was associated with poor survival.
Identifying a role for CD147 in driving tumor
invasion and metastasis not only helps us understand
this biomarker of cancer progression, but also develop
new drug target. Our meta-analysis indicates that CD147
expression predicts a bad survival in gastrointestinal
carcinomas.CD147 can therefore be used as a prognostic
marker for gastrointestinal cancer, and as a predictor of
cancer relapse.

CD147 is abundantly expressed in various types
of cancer tissue, and may promote cancer metastasis by
regulating the processes of cellular substrate and adhesion
[24–26]. CD147 also plays a key role in degradation of the
ECM through MMP induction [27–29], regulates VEGF
expression [30], stimulates proliferation, migration, and
cell survival independently of MMPs [31], and leads to
multidrug resistance to some chemotherapeutic drugs [32].
To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to
assess the association between CD147 expression and
disease-free and overall survival of gastrointestinal cancer
patients. Our meta-analysis combined the results of 1,993
gastrointestinal cancer patients from seven studies. The
meta-analysis indicated that CD147 expression can be
used to significantly predict poor disease-free and overall
survival of gastrointestinal cancer patients. Subgroup
analysis showed that the high expression of CD147
can predict poor prognosis in both gastric cancer and
colorectal cancer.
The tissue invasion, lymphatic metastases and
distant metastases of carcinomas, are the major prognostic
factors of solid cancers [21]. Traditional clinical
characteristics, such as size and stage of gastrointestinal
cancer, can predict clinical survival of patients. In our
study, significant correlations were observed between
CD147 and clinical characteristics including the depth of
invasion, lymph node metastasis, TNM stage, and distant
metastasis.
Our meta-analysis has a number of advantages. First,
it rigorously adhered to reporting recommendations for
tumor marker prognostic studies (REMARK) guidelines,
and carefully searched relevant studies from PubMed,
Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases.
Second, the enrolled researches all had a satisfactory
quality based on the strict inclusion criteria. Third,
subgroup analysis effectively minimized heterogeneity of
the included studies and further explored the application
of CD147 as a predictive marker for gastric and colorectal
cancer. Fourth, Begg’s funnel plots indicated that no
publication bias existed in the meta-analysis. This reflected
our methodological assessment of the researches to avoid
selection biases. Our comprehensive literature search
method also minimized publication bias.
Nevertheless, our meta-analysis has some
limitations. First, it included just seven studies, resulting
in a relative insufficiency in the subgroup analysis,
particularly when there was only one study to represent
results. Second, the method of calculating HRs from
reports might have led to heterogeneity. The HR of one
enrolled study was calculated by the method previously
documented by Tierney et al [22]. This reported the
number of death events of patients and the log-rank data
or p-value, which enable the HR to be approximated.
Although the calculated HR might be not as reliable as one

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Literature search and search strategy
We conducted this meta-analysis following
the PRISMA statement [33]. A literature search was
performed in Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Library and
Web of Science databases for clinical research published
before June 2016 that that assessed CD147 as a prognostic
factor for survival of patients with gastrointestinal
cancer using immunohistochemistry. The search used
the following terms: “gastrointestinal cancer”, “CD147”
OR “EMMPRIN” and “prognosis” OR “prognostic” OR
“survival”. The references of all relevant articles were
evaluated to find other related studies. Article language
was limited to English. Two reviewers independently
assessed the eligibility of the studies. Agreement was
reached for the discrepancies by discussion.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Inclusion criteria: (1) Study evaluated the correlation
between CD147 expression and survival of gastrointestinal
cancer patients; (2) Study assessed CD147 expression in

Quality assessment of included studies

FUNDING

Quality
assessment
and
methodological
assessment was peer-reviewed by 2 reviewers (Xiaohui
Huang and Weisong Shen) independently in each
of the acceptable studies, who scored them by the
ELCWP scale and REMARK guidelines [34]. This
validated quality assessment system is based on four
major classifications: scientific design, description of
immunohistochemistry methods, generalizability of
results, and the analysis of the study data. Each category
had a maximal score of 10 points with an overall
maximum theoretical score of 40 points. The final scores
were presented as percentages. Studies with ≥ 60%
points were considered high quality and were included
in the meta-analysis. The two investigators reported the
quality of included studies independently, and reach a
consensus value for each item.

Data extraction
Two reviewers (Xiaohui Huang and Weisong Shen)
independently extracted relevant data. The following
data were extracted from each study: first author, year of
publication, study period, number of participants, tumor
characteristics, survival. HRs and 95% CIs were used
to calculate the survival. If HRs and 95% CIs were not
directly reported in the included studies, we evaluated
the values in the original studies by using the methods
illustrated by Tierney et al [35]. If disagreements arose,
agreements were reached for the discrepancies by
discussion with another author (Bo Wei).

Statistical analysis
Stata 12.0 software (StatCorp, College Station,
TX, USA) was used for statistical analysis. Forest
plots were used to estimate the effect of expression
on disease-free and overall survival. HR values >1
were judged to indicate a association between CD147
expression and poor outcome. TNM stage (TIII/TIV vs
TI/TII), the depth of invasion (T3/T4 vs T1/T2), lymph
node metastasis (positive vs negative), and distant
metastasis (positive vs negative) were compared using
odds ratios (ORs). A p value of <0.05 was regarded
as significant. Heterogeneity was assessed by use of
Cochran Q and I2 statistics and considered significant
at p<0.1. If heterogeneity existed, the analysis used the
random effects model. Publication bias was assessed by
use of Begg’s funnel plot.
