ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) often features a combination of tumour
suppressor gene inactivation and multiple oncogene overactivation. The Axl
receptor tyrosine kinase is found overexpressed in GBM and thought to contribute to
invasiveness, chemoresistance and poor survival. Here, we have evaluated the effect
of BGB324, a clinical candidate Axl-specific small molecule inhibitor, on the invasive
behaviour of human GBM cells in vitro, as an indicator of its potential in GBM therapy
and also to elucidate the role of Axl in GBM pathogenesis.
Two cultured adult GBM cell lines, SNB-19 and UP007, were treated with Gas6
and/or BGB324, and analysed in assays for survival, 3D colony growth, motility,
migration and invasion. Western blot was used to detect protein expression and
signal protein phosphorylation. In both cell lines, BGB324 inhibited specifically
phosphorylation of Axl as well as Akt kinase further downstream. BGB324 also
inhibited survival and proliferation of both cell lines in a concentration-dependent
manner, as well as completely suppressing migration and invasion. Furthermore,
our results indicate co-operative activation between the Axl and Tyro3 receptors, as
well as ligand-independent Axl signalling, to take place in GBM cells. In conclusion,
small molecule inhibitor-led targeting of Axl may be a promising therapy for GBM
progression.

protective functions in the central nervous system (CNS),
where it is the most prominently expressed TAM [10, 11].
Additionally, Gas6, Protein S and Axl have been shown to
be expressed by stem cells in the subventricular zone and
to regulate their proliferation, survival and differentiation
[12, 13]. Axl/Gas6 signalling also protects axon integrity
[14]. This variety of roles indicates diversity in the
signalling pathways activated by the TAMs in normal
cellular homeostasis.
Aberrant

signalling
through
e.g.
overexpression has been observed in multiple cancers,
including gliomas [6]. Gliomas are the most common
form of brain cancer and are classified morphologically
according to the glial cell type from which they are
derived. In addition to the morphological classification,
they are usually distinguished by the WHO grading
system [15]. Lower grade tumours (grade I and grade

The TAMs (Tyro3, Axl, MerTK) are a subfamily
of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that share structural
homology in their extracellular regions, comprising a
pair of immunoglobulin-like domains followed by two
fibronectin type III repeats. This is followed by the RTK
family-wide possession of an intracellular tyrosine kinase
domain. The natural ligands for the TAMs are the vitamin
K-dependent proteins Gas6 (for all three receptors, with
highest affinity for Axl) and Protein S (Tyro3 and MerTK
only) [1-5].
Axl has been shown to mediate cell survival,
proliferation, migration and adhesion [6], whilst all three
receptors have been shown to play a role in immune cell
differentiation and phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells
[4, 7-9]. In addition, Tyro3 has been shown to exert neurowww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

II) are well differentiated and resemble normal tissue,
whereas higher grade tumours (grade III and grade IV)
are anaplastic and display high cell atypia and mitotic
activity [15]. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a grade
IV glioma and is highly heterogeneous and invasive
in nature. The current standard treatment for gliomas
consists of surgical tumour resection, radiotherapy and
adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy [16, 17]. The
5-year survival rate for GBM patients is less than 5%,
indicating the slow progress in therapy development and
therefore the need for more effective treatments [18].
Recent studies have demonstrated overexpression of
MerTK or Axl in astrocytic tumours of all grades, and coexpression of MerTK and Axl in all high grade glioma
tissue samples, relative to little or no expression in normal
CNS [19, 20]. Experimental blockade of Axl signalling
in cultured GBM cells resulted in decreased growth and
invasive potential [21]. Axl expression, and resulting
invasiveness of glioma cells, has been shown to be directly
regulated by the transcriptional regulator EZH2 through
a mechanism independent of histone methylation [22].
Additionally, glioma cells with elevated MerTK activation
showed greater resistance to pro-apoptotic stimuli as well
as increased invasive potential compared to cells with
MerTK expression silenced [23, 24]. Together, these
observations suggest the TAMs to be an attractive new
target for GBM therapy.
Novel, selective small molecule inhibitors (SMIs)
of RTKs are increasingly being developed as promising
new targeted molecular therapies for a variety of cancers.
BGB324 (also known as R428) [(1-(6,7-dihydro-5Hbenzo[6,7]cyclohepta[1,2-c]pyridazin-3-yl)-N3-((7pyrrolidin-1-yl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-5H-benzo[7]annulene2-yl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3,5-diamine)] is a highly selective
SMI of Axl (out of 133 tyrosine and serine/threonine
kinases tested) [25]. Treatment of mesenchymal carcinoma
cells with BGB324 abolished cell invasion and increased
chemosensitivity [26], whilst it nullified the tumorigenic
effect of triple negative breast cancer as well as blocking
their acquired resistance to erlotinib (anti-EGFR SMI).
BGB324 is currently in Phase 1b clinical trials for acute
myeloid leukaemia and non-small cell lung cancer, and
has so far been shown to be safely tolerated in clinical
safety studies in healthy volunteers at doses up to 1.5 g
daily (http://www.bergenbio.com/BGB324). Additionally,
in breast cancer mouse models, twice daily dosing of
25, 50, and 100 mg/kg BGB324 resulted in mouse
plasma concentrations of 2.4, 6.8, and 9.0 µM BGB324
respectively [25].
Here, we report our observations from a
comprehensive study of the cell biological and signalling
effects of BGB324 on two distinct patient-derived GBM
cell lines. We demonstrate that as an SMI, BGB324
selectively inhibits Axl-mediated growth, motility,
migration and invasion of GBM cells, as effectively
as when Axl is genetically knocked down. Therefore,

this study reveals Axl as an important mediator of
gliomagenesis, and indicates that specific targeting of
Axl with a highly selective SMI represents a new and
promising therapeutic avenue for GBM patients.

RESULTS
The TAMs are overexpressed in GBM cells
We first conducted an expression screen of all
TAMs in different human brain cell types, as well as
the GBM cell lines involved in this study (Figure 1).
In terms of protein expression, Axl and MerTK were
the more prominently expressed TAMs in human brain
microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3), while
only Axl and Tyro3 were expressed in human cerebellar
astrocytes (HA-c) (Figure 1A). Both GBM cell lines
SNB-19 and UP007 showed strong expression of Axl and
Tyro3 but negligible expression of MerTK. Quantitative
real-time PCR analysis also confirmed our western blot
results with similar expression patterns for each TAM
gene (Figure 1B). Interestingly, both MerTK and Tyro3
showed high expression in whole normal human brain
relative to the individual cell types, WHILST the opposite
was true for Axl. Additionally, Gas6 mRNA was found
to be most prominently expressed in normal human
astrocytes and the UP007 cell line. Furthermore, from
immunohistochemical staining for Axl in a GBM tissue
array, we detected aberrant expression of Axl protein in a
subset of GBM tumours (Supplementary Figure 1); this is
in keeping with gene expression profiling studies showing
Axl upregulation in brain tumours [27].

Gas6 activates Axl signalling in GBM cells
Gas6 is the principal ligand for all three TAM
receptors and has also been found to be overexpressed in
glioma [20]. Exogenous Gas6 stimulated phosphorylation
of Axl in SNB-19 cells but failed to do the same in UP007
cells (Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure 2A). In
addition, Gas6 did not stimulate Tyro3 phosphorylation in
either cell line (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure 2B).
However, Gas6 rapidly induced downstream intracellular
Akt phosphorylation in both cell lines by approximately
two-fold (Figures 2C and Supplementary Figure 2C).

BGB324 selectively inhibits Axl activity and
downstream signalling in GBM cells
BGB324 is an Axl-selective SMI, with a 15-fold
greater inhibitory efficacy versus the other TAMs in
biochemical assays [25]. In order to initially evaluate
the specificity of BGB324, we tested its effect on the
16184

activation of EGFR in the two GBM cell lines. EGFR
in cells was rapidly activated by EGF stimulation within
15min, an effect that was abolished by the EGFR-specific
SMI gefitinib (Figure 3). However, pre-incubation with
BGB324 had no effect on the EGFR activation by EGF
(Figure 3).
We then evaluated the effect of BGB324 on Gas6stimulated activity of Axl and Tyro3 in the GBM cell lines.
Pre-incubation with BGB324 did not inhibit Gas6-induced
Axl phosphorylation in SNB-19 cells at up to 10 µM.
However, in UP007 cells, BGB324 markedly inhibited
Axl phosphorylation (which was Gas6-independent)
at 10 µM to below baseline levels (Figure 4A and
Supplementary Figure 3A). BGB324 had no effect on
Tyro3 phosphorylation levels in SNB-19 cells, whereas
it showed a trend towards significance in inhibition in

UP007 cells (Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure 3B).
At 100 µM, BGB324 was toxic to all cells, as reflected
by the absence of a band for β-actin in the western blots.
Next, the effect of BGB324 on activation of
downstream signalling was investigated in the GBM
cells. BGB324 pre-treatment significantly inhibited Akt
phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner in
both cell lines, independently of Gas6 stimulation (Figure
4C and Supplementary Figure 3C). Therefore, the Akt
signalling pathway appears to emanate from Axl activation
in both GBM cell lines. In contrast to Akt signalling,
BGB324 had no effect on NF-κB pathway activation in
both GBM cell lines (data not shown), indicating a lack
of involvement of this pathway in Axl signalling in the
GBM cells.

BGB324 inhibits GBM cell growth and colony
formation

UP007 and SNB-19 cells (Figure 7). In addition, the
inhibitory effect of BGB324 at 1 µM was significantly
enhanced by co-incubation with 10 µM of TMZ, versus
either agent alone. Also, combinations at 50 µM TMZ did
not show a significantly increased effect in the presence of
BGB324, possibly due to the increased toxicity of TMZ
at such a high concentration. However, all concentrations
of BGB324 exhibited enhanced inhibitory effects when
combined with sub-toxic doses 10 µM and 25 µM of
TMZ.

Having observed that BGB324 robustly inhibited
Axl signalling in the GBM cells, we investigated the
effect of BGB324 on cell growth and survival using both
short-term and long-term cell-based assays. In short-term
experiments (MTS assay after 72h), BGB324 significantly
reduced viable cell number in both GBM cell lines in a
concentration-dependent manner, with a slightly greater
potency in UP007 cells (IC50 1 µM) compared to SNB-19
cells (IC50 2.5 µM) (Figure 5A). Additionally, no significant
increase in the number of apoptotic or necrotic cells was
observed in both cell lines following 24h treatment with
IC50 and double-IC50 concentrations of BGB324 (Figure
5B). In long-term cell growth experiments in 3D (soft agar
assays), BGB324 significantly reduced colony formation
at 0.75 µM in UP007 cells, and inhibition of SNB-19
colony formation was apparent at 2 µM of BGB324, with
complete inhibition of colony growth without cell death
achieved at 10 µM BGB324 (Figure 6).
Temozolomide (TMZ) is a chemotherapeutic
adjuvant to radiotherapy and is currently the only mildly
successful chemotherapeutic agent for GBM, extending
median survival by 3-4 months [16]. Therefore, we
investigated a possible combinatorial effect of BGB324
and TMZ in GBM cells. Treatment with TMZ resulted
in concentration-dependent decreases in viability of both

BGB324 inhibits cell migration, motility and
invasion in GBM cells
One of the biggest challenges in GBM treatment is
the highly invasive nature of the tumours, which leads to
multiple relapses. We therefore tested the effectiveness
of BGB324 against the migration, motility and
invasive capacity of the GBM cells. BGB324 inhibited
cell migration in both SNB-19 and UP007 cells in a
concentration-dependent manner (Figure 8A). Moreover,
cell tracking experiments revealed that sub-IC50 doses
of BGB324 profoundly inhibited the motility of cells in
both lines, affecting both average velocity of movement
and total distance travelled (Figure 8B). This indicates
that BGB324 can effectively block cell motility at doses
below those that can cause cell death. Furthermore, Axl
inhibition with BGB324 abolished invasion by both GBM

invasion of glioblastoma cells in vitro, which all contribute
to the aggressive clinical features of GBM.

GBM is the most common type of primary
malignant brain tumour in adults and is highly
heterogeneous and aggressive, with most patients facing
only a year of survival [28]. It is this heterogeneous and

invasive character to GBM that renders conventional
treatments ineffective. Despite intense investigation in
the last decade, our understanding of the pathogenesis
of these tumours still remains limited. It is thus of great
importance to find new targeted therapies that will increase
survival rates and quality of life for cancer patients.

The TAMs have recently been associated with glioma
pathophysiology, and therefore have emerged as attractive
novel therapeutic targets for brain tumours as part of
individualised treatment approaches. Therefore, SMIs
such as the highly selective Axl inhibitor BGB324 could
be more effective than the currently available treatments.

The present study is the first to assess the effectiveness of
an Axl-specific SMI on human GBM cells and on two cell
lines with different characteristics.
In agreement with previous studies, we have shown
that Axl is overexpressed in both GBM cell lines used
in this study [20], relative to its normal expression level
in human astrocytes. Moreover, we also observed an
overexpression of Tyro3 in both GBM cell lines, whereas
MerTK was found to be expressed clearly only in brain
microvascular endothelial cells. This expression profile
of the TAMs is consistent with previous studies [6]. In
particular, the observation that, in normal tissue, Tyro3 is
prominently expressed in the brain but not in astrocytes or
endothelium by exclusion suggests its expression either in
neuronal cells or other glial cell types, or both.
Gas6 is the common ligand for the TAM receptors,
with in vitro studies demonstrating a higher affinity for
Axl and Tyro3 than MerTK [29]. Using two GBM cell
lines with a basal level of Axl activity, we observed
that Gas6 activates Axl and Axl-associated signalling in
SNB-19 cells but also that Axl signalling appeared to be
Gas6-independent in the UP007 cell line. Gas6 did not
stimulate Tyro3 phosphorylation above the basal levels
apparent in either cell line. However, as MerTK was not
investigated in this study, and Gas6 stimulated Akt and
cell invasion in both cell lines, which cannot be explained
by activation of Axl or Tyro3 in the UP007 cell line, these
observations indicate a different route of stimulation by
Gas6 in the GBM cells. It is conceivable however that
Gas6 overexpression in GBM [20] can stimulate other
TAMs in a paracrine manner or instead to supress an
anti-tumour immune response. Furthermore, inhibition of
Akt was observed in both cell lines following treatment
with BGB324 even in the presence of Gas6, indicating
that BGB324 is effective in inhibiting basal Axl activity
and downstream signalling in a dose-dependent manner,
irrespective of the ligand.
We investigated the effect of Axl inhibition with
BGB324 on short-term growth/survival of GBM cells as
well as long-term colony formation. BGB324 inhibited
cell growth in both assays potently and in a concentrationdependent manner. The two cell lines exhibited different
responses, with the UP007 cell line being more susceptible
to inhibition (IC50= 1 µM) than the SNB-19 cell line
(IC50= 2.5 µM). The slightly greater resistance of SNB19 cells to BGB324 could possibly be due to a slight but
sufficient expression of MerTK in that cell line, which
UP007 completely lack, to compensate for inhibition of
Axl. We probed the particular functional effect of BGB324
on cell survival by apoptosis assays, and observed that
treatment of cells with BGB324 did not significantly
induce apoptosis or necrosis, thus demonstrating a clear
retardation in cell growth at non-toxic concentrations.
Therefore, this supports the potential of BGB324 as a
targeted chemotherapeutic compound, in contrast to
traditional chemotherapies. Furthermore, during cell
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

tracking experiments, a hindrance of cell division was
observed under the microscope in cells treated with
BGB324, although the precise effect of the drug on the
cell cycle requires investigation.
Activation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt was
also blocked by BGB324 in both cell lines, even in the
presence of Gas6. In accordance with previous data from
a study using a dominant negative form of Axl in GBM
cell lines [21], blocking Axl signalling with BGB324,
in addition to inhibiting cell proliferation/survival, also
reduced cell migration in a dose-dependent manner. The
total distance travelled and the velocity of migration were
reduced significantly at sub-IC50 concentrations for SNB19 and at the IC50 concentration for UP007 cells. Invasion
was also reduced to basal levels after incubation with
BGB324 following PDGF-AA stimulation in both cell
lines, indicating that Axl mediates the invasive character
of GBM cells in response to diverse humoral cues. Indeed,
studies have shown that Axl mediates tumour invasion and
chemoresistance through the activation of the PI3K/Akt
pathway in breast cancer [30, 31] as well as ovarian cancer
[32]. The BGB324 inhibition of GBM cell migration and
invasion we observed could be the result of suppressed
Akt signalling, although this requires further investigation.
The TAM family members have been demonstrated
to crosstalk with other receptors such as EGFR. Axl has
been shown to increase EGFR-conferred chemoresistance
in lung cancer [33], while it diversifies EGFR signalling
and increased resistance to targeted therapy in triple
negative breast cancer [34]. In our study we observed
that inhibiting Axl activation by BGB324 did not affect
activation of EGFR, supporting the specificity of BGB324
for Axl as well as excluding the possibility of EGFR
transactivation via Axl signalling. Moreover, neither did
Gas6 stimulate further activation of EGFR.
The possibility also exists for TAM family members
to heterodimerise with each other. Previous studies have
shown BGB324 to be more than 100-fold more selective
for Axl than Tyro3 for kinase inhibition in vitro. In our
study, BGB324 treatment of SNB-19 and UP007 cells
resulted in a reduction of Tyro3 phosphorylation in
UP007 cells but not in SNB-19 cells, indicating a possible
heterodimerisation between Axl and Tyro3 to occur in
UP007 cells. This could also account for the different
sensitivities of the cell lines towards Gas6 stimulation and
treatment with BGB324, and such a phenomenon warrants
further investigation.
The current treatment for GBM comprises surgical
tumour resection followed by radiotherapy with adjuvant
TMZ treatment, TMZ being an alkylating agent which
acts by interfering with DNA replication, thus enhancing
tumour cell death upon exposure to radiotherapy [17]. The
ability of TMZ to cross the blood-brain barrier has made it
a standard therapy for GBM, although patient survival is
increased by only a few months. In recent years, the focus
of TMZ combination with novel or current molecular
16192

Oncotarget

agents has been in the spotlight [17]. In the present study,
we have observed a concerted interaction between TMZ
and BGB324 in terms of their anti-growth effects on
GBM cells. As the mechanisms for this interaction are
not clear, a study with a larger number of concentration
combinations is needed to explore this further.
In conclusion, our data indicate that targeting Axl for
inhibition by a specific SMI such as BGB324 has robust
anti-tumour effects on GBM cells and could potentially
be effective in restraining tumour invasion in vivo and, in
combination with other agents, could effectively prolong
glioma patient survival. Future studies will be needed to
explore the anti-GBM tumour efficacy of Axl-selective
SMIs such as BGB324, which has been established to
be safe clinically and therefore may also be effective for
combating highly malignant brain tumours that are driven
by Axl.

combination with BGB324 for 3 days.

RNA extraction and quantitative real-time
polymerase chain reaction
Cellular total RNA was isolated using GeneJET
RNA purification kit (Life Technologies) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. First-strand cDNA
was synthesized using the nanoScript reverse
transcription kit (Primer Design, Southampton,
UK). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) amplification was
performed in 96-well plates in a mastermix for probes
(Roche, Burgess Hill, UK) and run on a LightCycler®
96 System (Roche). The qPCR amplifications for
the human AXL (assay I.D. Hs.PT.56a.1942285),
MERTK (assay I.D. Hs.PT.58.2640315), TYRO3
(assay I.D. Hs.PT.58.38778546) and GAS6 (assay
I.D. Hs.PT.58.21535693) genes were performed
using pre-designed primers/probes purchased from
Integrated DNA Technologies (Leuven, Belgium). The
amplification procedure entailed 45 cycles of 95oC for
10sec followed by 60oC for 30sec. Relative expression
analysis was performed using the equation N = N0 x 2Cp
(LightCycler®96 software; Roche), normalising against
the gene for ATP synthase subunit beta (ATP5B), which
was determined in-house as the best internal reference
gene out of 12 genes tested (geNorm kit, Primerdesign,
Southampton, UK; data not shown).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
The human GBM cell lines used in this study were
UP007 (established in-house from GBM biopsy resected at
King’s College Hospital, London under ethics permission
LREC00-173/11/SC/0048) and SNB-19 (DSMZ German
Brain Tumour Bank); both cell lines were authenticated inhouse as described previously [35] and were mycoplasma
tested. Cells were normally cultured in complete medium,
comprising Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (Fisher
Scientific, Loughborough, UK) supplemented with
10% foetal bovine serum (Lonza, Slough, UK), 2 mM
L-glutamine (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin (Fisher Scientific). Cells were
routinely grown to confluence in a humidified incubator
with 5% CO2 at 37◦C and passaged through dissociation
with trypsin/EDTA (Lonza). Cells were always grown to
near confluence before experimental use.

Immunohistochemistry
Brain tumour tissue array sections on glass slides,
with normal tissue as control (GL805a; US Biomax,
Rockville, MD) were deparaffinised using histology
grade xylene (Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK) for 5min and
rehydrated using descending concentrations (100%, 70%,
50%, 30%) of molecular grade ethanol (Fisher Scientific)
for 1min and 30sec respectively. Slides were then rinsed
for 2min in water. Antigen unmasking was performed
in 0.01 M sodium citrate (Fisher Scientific), pH 6 at
95oC with two changes for 5min each. The slides were
washed twice for 2mins in deionized water. Endogenous
peroxidase activity was blocked by incubating with 0.1%
hydrogen peroxide (Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature.
Following three 5min washes with Phosphatase Buffered
Saline (PBS), the slides were blocked with 1.5% rabbit
serum in PBS for 1h. The test slide was then incubated
with anti-Axl antibody at 1:100 dilution (goat polyclonal;
R&D Systems) in 1.5% rabbit serum/PBS for 2h. The
slides were then washed with PBS 3 times for 5min and
incubated with biotinylated anti-goat IgG secondary
antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) in 1.5% rabbit serum/PBS for
1h at room temperature. The slides were then incubated for
30 min with avidin-biotin enzyme reagent VECTASTAIN
ABC Kit (Vector laboratories, Peterborough, UK) and

Cell treatments
The SNB-19 and UP007 cells were first serumstarved for 24h, then incubated with BGB324 (gift of
BergenBio, Bergen, Norway) at the concentrations and
times indicated, in the absence or presence of recombinant
human Gas6 protein (400 ng/ml) (R&D Systems,
Abingdon, UK). In experiments using recombinant human
epidermal growth factor (EGF; R&D Systems), cells
were incubated with 50 ng/ml of EGF for 15min to cause
activation of EGFR, whilst in inhibition experiments,
cells were pre-incubated with 10 µM gefitinib (EGFR
SMI; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 2h
prior to EGF stimulation. In experiments using TMZ, cells
were incubated with 10 μM, 25 μM and 50 μM alone or in

washed with PBS three times for 5min. The slides were
then developed using ImmPACT DAB Peroxidase (HRP)
Substrate (Vector laboratories) for 10sec and washed
with deionizing water three times for 5min. The tissues
were counter-stained with haematoxylin and dehydrated
through increasing concentrations of alcohols (50%, 70%
95% 100%) for 30sec and 1min respectively, followed
by xylene for 1min, after which they were mounted with
DPX (Sigma-Aldrich). Images were captured by a Zeiss
Axiophot brightfield microscope at 20x magnification.

HRP (1:5,000) and anti-mouse HRP (1:5,000) (Promega,
Southampton, UK).

Cell survival/growth assay
1,500 cells per well were seeded in 96-well plates
and incubated overnight, prior to various treatments
(see above). Three or seven days post drug or Gas6
treatment respectively, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)5-(3-carboxymethoxy-phenyl)-2-(4-sulfo-phenyl)2H-tetrazolium (MTS) (Fisher Scientific) was added
to cells at 0.4 µM in the presence of 0.3 nM phenazine
methosulfate (Sigma) and incubated for a further 2h,
after which absorbance was measured at 492 nm using a
spectrophotometric microplate reader (Synergy; BioTek,
Potton, UK).

Western blotting
Cells were briefly rinsed in ice-cold phosphatebuffered saline (PBS; Fisher Scientific) and lysed in
ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton
X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM
Tris pH 8.0) supplemented with a cocktail of protease
and phosphatase inhibitors (Fisher Scientific). Cell
lysates were clarified by centrifugation and the proteins
electrophoretically separated by 10% SDS polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Cell lysates were also
prepared from primary human brain microvascular
endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3) and primary human
cerebellar astrocytes (HA-c) (ScienCell, Carlsbad,
CA). The separated proteins were transferred by a wet
transfer method onto an activated polyvinylidene fluoride
membrane (Millipore, Nottingham, UK). Membranes
were incubated for 1h at room temperature in blocking
buffer, which was either Tris-buffered saline-Tween 0.1%
(TBS-T; Fisher Scientific) containing 3% non-fat dry milk,
or otherwise containing 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA;
Fisher Scientific) if probing for phosphorylated proteins.
After blocking, membranes were incubated with primary
antibody diluted in appropriate blocking buffer overnight
at 4°C, then washed (3 x 5min) with TBS-T and incubated
with appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
secondary antibody diluted in appropriate blocking buffer
for 1h at room temperature. Following washing with
TBS-T (3 x 5min), membranes were incubated with an
enhanced chemiluminescence development reagent
(Luminata Forte; Millipore) for 3min and visualised with a
high sensitivity CCD camera imaging platform (Chemidoc
MP; Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, UK). The software
ImageJ [36] was used for densitometric quantification of
western blot band intensities.
The primary antibodies (and dilutions) used were:
Axl (C-20) (goat polyclonal; 1:1,000), Tyro3 (C-20) (goat
polyclonal; 1:1,000), MerTK (B-1) (mouse monoclonal;
1:1,000), p-EGFR and EGFR (goat polyclonal; 1:1,000)
(Santa Cruz), p-Axl (rabbit polyclonal; 1:500; R&D
systems), p-Akt 1/2/3 and Akt 1/2/3 (rabbit polyclonal;
1:1,000; Santa Cruz), p-Sky/Mer (rabbit polyclonal;
1:1,000), β-Actin (rabbit polyclonal; 1:5,000) (Sigma,
Poole, UK). Secondary antibodies used were donkey antirabbit HRP (1:2,000; Dako, Cambridge, UK), anti-goat

Apoptosis assay
30,000 cells per sample were treated with 2.5 µM
and 5 µM (SNB-19) or 1 µM and 2 µM BGB324 (UP007)
or vehicle (DMSO) for 24h. Following drug treatments the
cells were centrifuged at 400 x g for 5min and resuspended
in Annexin V binding buffer and incubated with Annexin
V-CF488A conjugate and Hoechst 33342 (Insight
Biotechnology, Wembley, UK) for 15min at 37oC using a
heating block. The cells were then spun down at 400 x g
for 5min and washed with Annexin V binding buffer twice
by repeating the centrifugation and resuspension. Finally
the cells were resuspended in 100 µl supplemented with 10
µg/ml propidium iodide (Insight Biotechnology) and 30 µl
was loaded onto a special chamber slide (NC-Slide A2™)
and cell populations were analysed for Annexin V/PI
fluorescence (NucleoCounter® NC-3000™; Chemometec
A/S, Allerød, Denmark) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.

Scratch wound assay
Linear cell migration along a surface was measured
by scratch wound assay, where a linear scratch was made
in a confluent cell monolayer with a 200 µl yellow pipette
tip. Following injury, wound closure was monitored using
an inverted Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope housed in
a live cell imaging chamber under normal cell culture
conditions (37°C, 5% CO2, humid atmosphere). Images
of 4 points per well were captured every 3h over a total
period of 21h. Image analysis following the experiment
was performed using ImageJ, and cell migration rates
(area change/h) calculated thereafter.

Statistical analyses

GBM cells were seeded in 24-well plates at low
density (1,500 cells/well). Following treatment with
BGB324 or vehicle (DMSO), live cell microscopic
images of 4 points per well were taken every 20min
for 24h under normal culture conditions (37°C, 5%
CO2, humid atmosphere) using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M
inverted live cell microscope with time-lapse imaging
at 10x magnification. Quantification of cell tracking,
measuring distance and trajectory were performed using
ImageJ with its Cell Tracking plug-in. In total, 60 cells
per condition were tracked randomly for a period of 3h,
with total distance (µm) and average velocity (µm/min)
being calculated.

All data are expressed as mean±SEM, obtained
from a minimum of 3 independent experiments, each
constituting multiple replicates per condition. Quantitative
data were analysed by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
with post-hoc Bonferroni test for multiple comparisons
with one control group “or multiple time points/treatments,
or paired t-test for comparisons of control with treatment
“ Statistical analyses and graphical representations were
performed using Prism (GraphPad Software Inc). The
level of statistical significance is indicated in the figures
and accompanying legends. Western blot image processing
was performed using Adobe Photoshop CC 2014 software
(Adobe Systems Incorporated, CA, USA).

Colony growth assay

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Wells of 24-well plates were first coated with 0.5
mL of complete medium/0.5% agar, and then GBM cells
suspended in complete medium/0.35% agar were seeded
at low density (1,500 cells/well). Cells were incubated
for 2 weeks in total, with media and treatments being
replenished weekly. Colonies present at the end of
the incubation period were stained by incubation with
0.05% crystal violet solution (Fisher Scientific) for 1h.
Images were taken of each well using a Zeiss Stemi SVG
dissecting microscope (1.5 x magnification), and colonies
were counted in 5 different fields of view.

Modified Boyden transwell chambers were used to
assess cell invasion through extracellular matrix. Briefly,
polycarbonate hanging inserts (Corning, Amsterdam, The
Netherlands) were coated with 60 µg/ml Geltrex™ LDEVfree reduced growth factor basement membrane matrix
(Life Technologies). Invasion in the cell culture incubator
was allowed to occur over 6h for UP007 cells (20,000
cells/well) and 16h for SNB-19 cells (10,000 cells/well).
Non-invading cells on the upper surface of the filter were
removed with a cotton swab and cells that had invaded
and adhered to the lower side of the filter were fixed for
15min with 37% formaldehyde solution containing 1015% methanol (Sigma). Following fixation and brief
wash with PBS, the adherent cells were stained with 0.5%
crystal violet. Images were captured by a Zeiss Axiophot
brightfield microscope and cells were counted in 5 random
fields at a 10x magnification. Invasion was expressed as
mean fold ± standard error of the mean (SEM) of the
number of total cells counted per well.
