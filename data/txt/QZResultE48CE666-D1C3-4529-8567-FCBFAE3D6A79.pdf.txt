BACKGROUND: Children who are treated for myeloid leukemia associated with Down syndrome (DS) experience superior survival compared with children who have myeloid leukemia without DS. To maintain excellent outcomes while avoiding toxicity, the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) conducted the phase 3 trial COG A2971, the first trial solely designed to provide uniform treatment of myeloid leukemia
in North American children with DS. A2971 eliminated 2 induction drugs and 3 months of maintenance therapy from the standard-timing
regimen of dexamethasone, cytarabine, 6-thioguanine, etoposide, and rubidomycin/daunomycin (DCTER) used in the previous study
(Children’s Cancer Group [CCG] 2891). METHODS: COG A2971 was a multi-institutional, nonrandomized, clinical trial that enrolled 132
patients who had DS with either acute myeloid leukemia (n ¼ 91) or myelodysplastic syndrome (n ¼ 41). RESULTS: The median follow-up was 4.8 years (range, 0.8-8.6 years), the median age at diagnosis was 1.7 years (range, 0.3-13.6 years), and the median white
blood cell count was 6200/lL (range, 900-164,900/lL). The remission rate (92.7%  6%) was similar to that reported in the CCG
2891 study (91.3%  5%; P ¼ .679). The 5-year event free survival (EFS) rate was 79%  7% (vs 77%  7% in CCG 2891; P ¼ .589), the
disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 89%  6% (vs 85%  6% in CCG 2891; P ¼ .337), and the overall survival rate was 84%  6% (vs
79%  7% in CCG 2891; P ¼ .302). Induction day-14 bone marrow response trended toward a more favorable outcome (EFS: P ¼ .12).
Age >4 years was an adverse risk factor (5-year EFS rate: 33%  38% for children aged >4 years [median, 8.5 years; n ¼ 6] vs 81% 
7% for children ages 0-4 years [median, 1.7 years; n ¼ 126]; P ¼ .001). CONCLUSIONS: The COG A2971 trial reduced the chemotherapy
dose and maintained survival to that achieved by the CCG 2891 trial in children who had myeloid leukemia associated with DS. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Children who have myeloid leukemia associated with Down syndrome (DS) exhibit unique differences in epidemiologic,
clinical, and biologic patterns of disease compared with similar children who do not have DS.1-6 Children with DS are especially vulnerable to the development of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMkL), a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) that is rarely observed in the non-DS pediatric population and is typically associated with worse survival in children
without DS.7,8 Despite this increased susceptibility to AMkL, reports from sequential pediatric cooperative group trials consistently have demonstrated superior outcomes for children (aged <4 years) who have myeloid leukemia associated with DS
(ML-DS) compared with other children who have AML.4,5,9-13

A2971 Reduces Therapy, Sustains Survival/Sorrell et al

One recent study (Children’s Cancer Group [CCG]
2891) conducted by the CCG highlighted the need to
develop clinical trials that are specifically designed to meet
the needs of North American children with ML-DS. The
CCG 2891 trial demonstrated that children with ML-DS
who received intensively timed cycles of combined dexamethasone, cytarabine, 6-thioguanine, etoposide, and
rubidomycin/daunomycin (DCTER) induction therapy
had very high toxic death rates (32%).14 In contrast, children with ML-DS who received standard-timing DCTER
induction therapy had a toxic death rate of 11%, (P ¼
.003), which was similar to that in children without DS.
Overall, the study demonstrated better outcomes for children with ML-DS treated with standard-timing DCTER
induction therapy, in contrast to the improved survival
with the use of intensively timed DCTER induction in
children without DS.
On the basis of these results, the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) designed the clinical trial COG
A2971 with an overall objective to reduce acute morbidity
and mortality in children with ML-DS while maintaining
or improving efficacy. The COG A2971 trial eliminated
etoposide and dexamethasone from the CCG 2891 standard-timing DCTER induction regimen15 and removed 3
months of systemic maintenance chemotherapy, leaving
only 3 intrathecal (IT) doses of cytarabine as maintenance
treatment. Because children with DS aged <2 years had
better outcomes than the older cohorts of children (ages
2-4 years and aged >4 years) with ML-DS enrolled on
CCG 2891, COG A2971 also sought to determine
whether the prognostic impact of age was reproducible.16
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study

COG A2971 was a prospective, multi-institutional, phase
3, clinical research study conducted by the COG. It was a
nonrandomized trial that enrolled children with DS into
1 of 2 age-based subgroups: children with transient
myeloproliferative disease (TMD)17 and children with
ML-DS. The purpose of this report is to describe the
outcome for children with ML-DS.
Patients

Patients or their legal guardians provided informed consent, which was approved by local institutional review
boards and complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Eligible children included those with karyotype confirmation of a DS diagnosis and a pathologic diagnosis of either
AML or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) that required
treatment. AML and MDS were classified according to
Cancer

October 1, 2012

the French-American-British (FAB) criteria, which were
the standard criteria used during the initiation of this
study.18-21 For this analysis, the definition of MDS was
limited to 29% blasts in the bone marrow (BM) sample. For the purposes of this report, patients who had
AML or MDS are referred to collectively to as myeloid
leukemia of DS (ML-DS).14 Pathologic and cytogenetic
classifications were reported by participating institutions.
This trial began before reports of an association between
GATA binding protein 1 (GATA1) and ML-DS3 and
did not collect banked leukemia samples to determine
mutation prevalence.
Children with a prior history of TMD, chloromas,
or central nervous system (CNS) disease were included in
this study. Children who had promyelocytic leukemia or
who had received prior treatment for ML-DS were not eligible. Children who had MDS that did not require chemotherapeutic intervention (defined as refractory anemia,
refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts with mild cytopenias, or mild primary cytopenias without dysplasia)
were enrolled on study and observed until the investigators believed therapy was indicated clinically; then, they
were assigned to the treatment arm.
Eligibility for the TMD arm was defined as age <3
months with pathologic evidence of nonerythroid blasts
documented in the peripheral blood or by biopsy of an
affected organ. Infants with TMD were either observed
with supportive care only or were provided brief intervention with exchange transfusion, leukopheresis, or lowdose cytarabine therapy. These infants were followed
prospectively until TMD resolved, subsequent ML-DS
developed, or the patient attained age 5 years. If patients
with TMD were diagnosed subsequently with ML-DS,
then they were transferred to the therapeutic arm for children with ML-DS and were included in this report. Patients
with prior TMD were included whether or not they
received TMD-directed chemotherapy. The diagnostic,
therapeutic, and outcome data for children with TMD who
did not develop ML-DS are reported separately.17
Treatment and Monitoring

Treatment consisted of 4 cycles of standard-timing induction therapy, 1 course of intensification therapy, and concluded with 3 additional doses of IT cytarabine injection
divided over 3 weeks for maintenance therapy (Fig. 1).
Chemotherapy for children aged <36 months was dosed
per kilogram of body weight; children aged >36 months
were dosed per meter squared of body surface area. Each
cycle of oral 6-thioguanine was given with a continuous
infusion of cytarabine and daunorubicin (CI-TAD).

Figure 1. Children’s Oncology Group (COG) trial A2971 provided continuous-infusion cytarabine and daunorubicin plus oral
6-thioguanine (CI-TAD) therapy (according to the Regimen B treatment arm) to eligible children with Down syndrome and acute
myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome. One cycle of CI-TAD consisted of oral 6-thioguanine (T) at a dose of 50 mg/m2
twice daily for 4 consecutive days with a 96-hour, continuous, intravenous infusion of cytarabine (A) 200 mg/m2 for 24 hours
and daunomycin (D) 20 mg/m2 for 24 hours on days 0 through 3. Intensification therapy consisted of the Capizzi II regimen of
high-dose cytarabine (HD Ara-C) 3000mg/m2 per dose intravenously every 12 hours 4 times on days 0 and 1 and on days 7 and
8 and an intramuscular injection of L-asparaginase (L-Asp) 6000 IU/m2 3 hours after the final dose of HD Ara-C on days 1 and 8.
Central nervous system (CNS) consolidation consisted of 3 doses of intrathecal (IT) cytarabine therapy.

Induction therapy consisted of a 96-hour continuous
infusion of cytarabine (200 mg/m2 daily) and daunorubicin (20 mg/m2 daily) combined with 4 once-daily doses
of oral 6-thioguanine (100 mg/m2) given on days 0
through 3. CI-TAD induction therapy did not include
etoposide or dexamethasone. Patients received standardtiming CI-TAD induction therapy, and they received
each subsequent cycle when their absolute neutrophil
count (ANC) was >1000/lL and their platelet count was
>100,000/lL. The only exception to this rule was for
patients who had >30% blasts on day 14 after the start of
induction cycle 1; these patients were to proceed directly
to cycle 2 before peripheral blood count recovery. An IT
dose of cytarabine was administered on day 0 of each cycle
of induction therapy. The IT cytarabine doses were agedependent: 20 mg for ages 0 to 12 months, 30 mg for ages
13 to 24 months, 50 mg for ages 25 to 35 months, and 70
mg for age 36 months. Additional IT chemotherapy
was given to children who had CNS disease.
BM response was assessed on day 14 of induction
cycle 1. BM remission status was assessed after peripheral
blood count recovery (approximately day 28 of each cycle)
and at the end of induction cycles 1 and 4 (with the end of
cycle 4 defined as the end of the induction phase of therapy). The postremission intensification phase of therapy
consisted of 3-hour infusions of cytarabine 3000 mg/m2
given every 12 hours on days 0 and 1 and on days 7 and 8
(8 total doses), and L-asparaginase 6000 U/m2 given once
intramuscularly on days 1 and 8. Afterward, patients went
on to receive once-weekly IT doses of cytarabine for CNS
consolidation for 3 weeks using the age-dependent dosing
as described above. A final BM examination was performed with the last dose of IT chemotherapy.
Patients with ML-DS who transferred from
the TMD arm may have previously received low-dose
4808

cytarabine intervention for symptomatic TMD disease
(1 to 4 cycles of continuous infusion cytarabine; 1 cycle
consisted of 3.33 mg/kg every 24 hours for 120 hours at
16.7 mg/kg per cycle).
Disease Response Criteria

Patients with AML were considered to be in complete
remission (CR) when BM morphologic evaluation demonstrated <5% blasts (M1) with adequate peripheral
blood count recovery (ANC >1000/lL and platelet count
75,000/lL). A partial response (PR) was defined as 5%
to 29% blasts (or 5%-39% blasts in BM with severe hypocellularity). Patients who had AML with >5% BM blasts
at the end of 4 cycles of CI-TAD therapy were considered
to have refractory disease and were removed from the
study.
BM response was assessed in patients with MDS at
the end of the first cycle of induction therapy (approximately day 28). For study purposes, a CR was defined as
<5% BM blasts with trilineage engraftment and
improved peripheral blood counts (M1). A PR was
defined as a reduction in the BM blast count with an
improvement in cytopenias (M2). Persistent dysplasia
and Auer rods were acceptable. Patients with MDS and
M2 BM samples at the end of cycle 1 were allowed to proceed to cycle 2 without peripheral blood count recovery.
Treatment failure (progressive disease) was defined as an
increase in the BM blast count and/or persistent peripheral cytopenias (ie, no improvement or worsening).
Patients with MDS were required to be in CR by the end
of all 4 cycles of induction therapy.
Statistical Considerations

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the
efficacy of reduced-dose chemotherapy for DS patients
diagnosed with ML-DS compared with similar DS

39 patients in this de novo ML-DS group had a prior
history of TMD but had not been enrolled on the TMD
arm. The median length of follow-up in all patients was
4.8 years (range, 0.8-8.6 years).
The demographic characteristics of the patients with
ML-DS on COG A2971 are summarized in Table 1 and
are comparable to those in the historic control group on the
CCG 2891 trial. The median age at diagnosis was 1.7 years
(range, 0.3-13.6 years), including 85 patients who were
aged <2 years (birth to 2-year age group), 41 patients were
between ages 2 years and 4 years (2 to 4-year age group),
and 6 patients were aged >4 years (>4-year age group). In
the COG A2971 study, there were statistically significant,
smaller percentages of children with hepatomegaly (33.6%
vs 50.9% on CCG 2891; P ¼ .003) and/or splenomegaly
(29% vs 49.1% on CCG 2891; P ¼ .001).
Among the 18 children who were previously
enrolled on the TMD arm, in which a set screening schedule was used, the median age at diagnosis of subsequent
ML-DS was significantly younger than among the 39

children with a history of TMD who were not enrolled on
the TMD arm (median age, 1.2 years vs 1.9 years; P ¼
.005) or among the 75 children with de novo ML-DS
who had no prior history of TMD (median age, 1.2 years
vs 1.7 years; P ¼ .015). The entire cohort of 57 children
who had a reported antecedent history of TMD had clinical and disease characteristics similar to those of the children with DS of similar ages without a reported history of
TMD (P > .05) and, thus, described together.
Table 2 summarizes the disease-related characteristics of the children in our study compared with the children enrolled on CCG 2891. Approximately 33% of the
patients with AML in each group presented with a prior
history of MDS (31% vs 25%, respectively; P ¼ .289).
Institutional FAB classification identified a lower than
expected M7 prevalence and a higher than previously
reported MDS prevalence, and many may have had M7
disease with low blast percentages. Unlike the 4.3% of
children with CNS disease enrolled on CCG 2891, none
of the children on COG A2971 had CNS disease at diagnosis or relapse (P ¼ .018).

related differences between the CR rates in children aged
4 years (n ¼ 89) and children aged >4 years (n ¼ 6; P ¼
.498). All 18 children who had previously enrolled on the
TMD arm achieved CR by the end of induction therapy,
including the 2 patients with TMD who had received prior
chemotherapy. However, 82% of the patients with MLDS who had a history of TMD but who had not previously
enrolled on the TMD arm (n ¼ 39) achieved CR (P ¼
.163). These remission rates were not statistically different
from those in the patients without antecedent TMD.

anthracycline dose of 320 mg/m2 with no excess cardiac
toxicity detected (nonsignificant P value compared with
CCG 2891). The relatively higher percentages of nonhematologic toxicities observed during induction and intensification on COG A2971 were not different from those
observed on CCG 2891. The high proportion of patients
with pulmonary toxicity on COG A2971 is consistent
with the finding from the CCG 2891 study16 and was
most prevalent during the first 2 cycles of induction therapy. Only 1 postremission death was reported on the
COG A2971 study (vs n ¼ 4 on CCG 2891; nonsignificant P value). This child with ML-DS died on day 11 of
intensification therapy (at the end of high-dose cytarabine
therapy) from neutropenic fever, pseudomembranous
colitis, hyponatremia, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
Induction Response

Remission was evaluable in 108 of the 132 study participants. Twenty-four patients were not evaluable for induction response, including 1 patient who withdrew before the
third cycle of induction therapy because of toxicity, 1
patient who died of disease, 2 patients who did not have
data submitted, and 20 patients who were not evaluable
because of failure to obtain a BM sample at the end of the 4
cycles of induction therapy. CRs were achieved in 84% of
patients, and PRs were achieved in 8% of patients. Most of
the children (74%) with DS (birth to 4-year age group)
had a good response (<5% blasts on morphologic evaluation) by day 14 of the first cycle of induction therapy (n ¼
77 of 104 evaluable patients) (Fig. 2). Similar to CCG
2891, only 6.4% of patients developed progressive ML-DS
(P ¼ .955). There were no statistically significant age4812

The 5-year survival rates (OS, 84%  6%; EFS, 79% 
7%) from the time of enrollment among all treated
patients were similar to those reported in the CCG 2891
study (OS, 79%  7%; EFS, 77%  7%; P > 0.3). The
DFS rates from the time of induction remission were
comparable between the 2 studies, with an 89%  6% 5year DFS rate in the COG A2971 study and an 85% 
6% 5-year DFS rate in the CCG 2891 study (P ¼ .337).
Among the children aged <4 years (Fig. 2), there was a
trend toward better EFS among those who rapidly cleared
their BM blasts at the day-14 BM examination (5-year
EFS rate: 86% [<5% blasts; n ¼ 77] vs 72% [5% blasts;
n ¼ 27]; P ¼ .12).
The children who had ML-DS with antecedent
TMD (n ¼ 57) had survival outcomes similar to those
of the children who had de novo ML-DS (n ¼ 75;
P ¼ .814). The 8 children who had mosaic DS had the
same outcome as the rest of the children who had fully
expressed, constitutional trisomy 21.
Older age remained a statistically significant adverse
risk factor, with a poor 5-year EFS rate of 33%  38%
(n ¼ 6) in children with ML-DS who were aged >4 years
(median age, 8.5 years; range, 4.2-13.6 years). This is in
contrast to the favorable 81%  7% 5-year EFS rate
observed in children with ML-DS who were aged 4
years (median age, 1.7 years; range, 0.3-3.8 years; n ¼
126; P ¼ .001). These results are consistent with the poor
33%  31% EFS rate observed in children aged >4 years
on the CCG 2891 study. The 5-year EFS rate for children
aged <2 years on the COG A2971 study was 82%  9%
(n ¼ 85), which was comparable to the 86%  7% rate (n
¼ 94) observed on the prior CCG 2891 study (P ¼ .504).
The EFS rate for children ages 2 to 4 years on COG
A2971 was 80%  13% (n ¼ 41) compared with 68% 
12% (n ¼ 58) in the CCG 2891 study (P ¼ .227). Unlike
CCG 2891, the COG A2971 study revealed no significant difference in EFS between children aged <2 years
versus the slightly older children who were in the group

Figure 3. Age-based event-free survival probabilities are illustrated for children with Down syndrome and acute myeloid

Children’s Oncology Group Trial A2971 (COG A2971): Fiveyear event-free survival probability age comparisons are illustrated for children ages birth to 2 years versus children ages
>2 to 4 years (P ¼ .726), for children ages >2 to 4 years versus children aged >4 years (P ¼ .010), and for children ages

ages 2 to 4 years (P ¼ .726) (Fig. 3). COG A2971 agebased comparisons of EFS were similar to DFS probabilities (5-year DFS in the group aged <2 years [n ¼ 72] vs
the group ages 2-4 years [n ¼ 26]; P ¼ .73; 5-year DFS in
the group ages 2-4 years vs the group aged >4 years [n ¼
3]; P < .001; and 5-year DFS in the group ages birth to 4
years vs the group aged >4 years; P < .001). There were
no overall differences observed in the TRM rate from
study entry between COG 2971 (3%  3%) and the
CCG 2891 study (4%  3%; P ¼ .747).
DISCUSSION
COG A2971 is the first clinical trial conducted by the
Children’s Oncology Group that was designed prospectively to meet the unique clinical and biologic manifestations of ML in children with DS. COG A2971 achieved a
5-year EFS rate of 79%  7% (vs 77%  7% in the CCG
2891 trial; P ¼ .589) while maintaining a low induction
failure rate of 6.4%  6%, attaining a 0% CNS relapse
rate, and sustaining an acceptably low 5-year postremission, induction treatment-related mortality rate of 1% 
2%, equivalent that reported in CCG 2891 (P ¼ .789).
The trend toward a more favorable outcome for the children who achieved an early BM response (<5% blasts by
day 14) in this study is consistent with past reports from
the BFM suggesting that clearance of morphologic blasts
by day 14 or 15 in the nonacute promyelocytic leukemia
population may predict better outcomes and suggests a
possible therapeutic stratification point for children with
DS in future research trials.22

The poor outcome of the children with ML-DS
aged >4 years (EFS rate: 33%  39% in COG A2971,
33%  31% in CCG 2891; nonsignificant P value) has
now been confirmed in 2 consecutive CCG/COG studies.
Remission failures were the primary reason for the worse
EFS in the historic control group.16 Although the cumulative numbers of older children with ML-DS on these 2 trials is small (5% of each study group), these findings are
supported by recent European trials.4,23-26 The outcome
in this older ML-DS cohort is similar to that observed in
the pediatric AML population without DS. Whether this
worse outcome in older ML-DS children compared with
their younger peers is because of a difference in leukemic
cell biology (eg, GATA1 mutations27) remains to be
determined, because such information was not collected
in this trial. Consequently, older children with DS appear
to require the more dose-intensive treatment used in the
children without DS.
The excellent outcomes maintained by COG
A2971for the majority of children aged <4 years with
ML-DS suggest that further dose reduction may be feasible for this population. The primary reason for treatment
failure is disease response, and not toxic mortality. Thus,
the very poor outcomes for those who fail to enter remission or relapse indicate the need to pursue a risk-based
therapeutic approach combining the presence or absence
of the now known GATA-1 mutation in ML-DS and
response, such as the day-14 and day-15 BM examination
and/or the application of minimal residual disease assays
currently used by COG in the non-DS AML trial,
AAML1031. This may permit dose intensification or use
of more targeted therapy in the ‘‘high-risk’’ DS children
while maintaining or allowing further therapy reduction
for the majority of children with DS.
