BACKGROUND: Elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are generally unable to withstand the rigors of intensive induction chemotherapy and its attendant complications. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) is an immunoconjugate
that had demonstrated activity in recurrent AML. METHODS: The objective of the current study was to determine the
prognostic factors for achievement of complete remission (CR) in newly diagnosed elderly AML patients treated with
GO as initial induction therapy. A retrospective study was performed of efficacy and toxicity associated with GO therapy, and factors potentially predictive of response were assessed in 49 previously untreated AML patients. RESULTS:
CR was achieved in 14% of all treated patients. Among the patients with an intermediate-risk karyotype, the CR rate
was 30%, compared with none with an unfavorable karyotype. The median duration of overall survival was 3.7 months
(95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.4-6.9 months), and the median recurrence-free survival in patients who achieved
CR was 11.8 months (95% CI, 5.0-ind months). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that GO should be considered as
a first-line treatment option in older patients with AML with intermediate-risk cytogenetics who cannot tolerate highC 2010 American Cancer Society.

KEYWORDS: acute myeloid leukemia, therapy, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, prognostic factors.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is more prevalent in older adults, with a median age at diagnosis between 65 and 70
years.1 Differences in both host and disease biology distinguish AML in the elderly compared with younger patients. Elderly
patients have poorer performance status at diagnosis, a higher incidence of poor-prognosis karyotypes, and are more resistant
to chemotherapeutic agents. They also have a higher incidence of induction therapy deaths, a lower rate of complete response,
and lower long-term survival.2,3 Thus, new approaches are needed to improve treatment in elderly patients with AML.
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) is a targeted antineoplastic agent comprised of a recombinant anti-CD33 humanized
antibody linked to N-acetyl-c-calicheamicin.4 GO was approved in 2000 by the United States Food and Drug Administration
for use in patients age 60 years with CD33þ AML in first recurrence who are not considered candidates for further cytotoxic
chemotherapy.5 The most important associated hematologic toxicity is myelosuppression, and a frequently reported lifethreatening nonhematologic adverse event is hepatic veno-occlusive or sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (VOD/SOS).6,7 Several studies also evaluated the efficacy of GO in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy for treating patients with refractory/recurrent AML8,9 as well the use of GO as first-line therapy in newly diagnosed AML patients.10-14
To characterize outcomes of GO induction therapy in patients age 70 years with previously untreated AML treated
at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI), we performed a retrospective study of efficacy and toxicity associated with GO therapy. We also assessed factors potentially predictive of response.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Group
One hundred twenty-eight patients with newly diagnosed, refractory, and recurrent AML (excluding acute promyelocytic
leukemia) were treated with GO at the UPCI between February 2004 and October 2008. Among the 128 patients,

only the newly diagnosed AML patients age 70 years
(n ¼ 49) treated with GO were included in the analysis
(Table 1). Cases of AML were classified as secondary on
the basis of a history of previous treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy or having antecedent hematologic
conditions, including myelodysplasia and myeloproliferative disorders. The study was approved by the University
of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board according to
institutional guidelines.
Therapy
Patients received 9 mg/m2 of GO as a single intravenous
infusion on Days 1 and 15. The second dose was administered, irrespective of the peripheral counts, if patients had
recovered from nonhematologic toxicities resulting from
the first dose and had no evidence of uncontrolled infection or disease progression. The outcomes of patients
were evaluated for the treatment period, which was
defined as 28 days after the administration of GO and for
the follow-up period, which was defined as the time subsequent to the treatment period.
Cytogenetics
Cytogenetic abnormalities were grouped by published criteria.15 The favorable risk category included patients with
abnormalities (abn) of inv(16)/t(16;16)/del(16q) or
t(8;21) without either a del(9q) or being part of a complex
karyotype. The intermediate-risk category included
patients characterized by þ8, Y, þ6, del (12p), or normal karyotype. The unfavorable-risk category was defined
by the presence of 1 or more of 5/del(5q), 7/del(7q),

Criteria for Response
Using standard criteria, complete response (CR) was
defined by the presence of <5% blasts in the bone marrow, absence of extramedullary leukemia, peripheral
blood count recovery with a neutrophil count of at least
1  109/L and platelet count of at least 100  109/L, and
normal cytogenetics (in those with previously abnormal
cytogenetics).15 Patients were considered to have no
response (NR) if they did not meet all of these criteria.
Statistical Analysis
Comparisons of demographic and baseline characteristics
by response status were made by Fisher exact test for categorical variables and by Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables. Overall survival and recurrence-free
survival were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method
from our study database, locked on February 28, 2009.
Overall survival was measured from the date of treatment
start until the date of recorded death. Recurrence-free survival was measured from the date complete response was
achieved until the date of documented recurrence or
death. For patients presumably still alive or recurrencefree, follow-up was censored at the date of last examination or patient contact. In 2 instances, the upper 95%
confidence limit on median survival time was indeterminate (labeled ind) due to an insufficient number of events.
SAS statistical software (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc,
Cary, NC) was used for all statistical analyses.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
A total of 49 patients with previously untreated AML
were evaluated. Patient demographics and baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. The median age was 77
years (range, 70-88 years) and 47% of patients had secondary AML. Twenty-six (53%) patients had an unfavorable-risk karyotype and 23 (47%) had an intermediaterisk karyotype.
Treatment and Response
All 49 patients completed the first dose of GO; 30
patients received a second dose, the remaining 19 did not
continue treatment because of disease progression or
infection. Seven of 49 patients (14%) achieved CR; all
patients achieving CR received 2 doses of GO. The

median time to CR was 23 days after the completion of
GO administration. Seven of 23 (30%) intermediate-risk
patients achieved CR, as compared with none of the 26
patients with an unfavorable karyotype (Table 2). Ten
patients who did not respond to GO received additional
treatment, including cytarabine, decitabine, hydroxyurea,
etoposide, and idarubicin. Only 2 patients who received
idarubicin and cytarabine (7 þ 3) achieved a CR.
Survival of Patients Treated With GO
Forty-four of the 49 patients had died by the time of our
analysis. The median overall survival for all patients was

Toxicity
All patients developed grade 3 to 4 neutropenia and
thrombocytopenia, with complete responders requiring a
median of 18 days (range, 9-40 days) from the completion
of treatment to recover their neutrophils and a median of
23 days (range, 10-33 days) to recover their platelets. A
total of 16 (32%) of the 49 patients died during the treatment period. The causes of death were disease progression
(n ¼ 7), sepsis (n ¼ 5), multi-organ failure (n ¼ 3), and
hemorrhage (n ¼ 1). Grade 3 to 4 transaminitis was
observed in 4 patients (8%) and grade 3 elevation in total
bilirubin in 1 patient (2%). Signs and symptoms of VOD
were observed in 1 patient who died of multi-organ failure
after receiving 2 doses of GO.

3.7 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.4-6.9

months (95% CI, 1.1-52.0) for those not responsive to
therapy (P ¼ .001) (Fig. 2). The median survival for
patients with an unfavorable karyotype was 1.2 months
(95% CI, 0.6-4.4 months) and for patients with an
intermediate-risk karyotype was 6.8 months (95% CI,

The therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of GO as first-line
therapy in newly diagnosed patients with AML has been
evaluated in recent studies, with reported rates of CR
ranging from 8% to 27% and a median survival of only a

few months (Table 3).10-14 Myelosuppression has been
universally observed during GO treatment, and induction
deaths ranged from 0% to 37% caused by infections,
hemorrhage, and VOD of the liver.
In our study, 49 newly diagnosed patients with
AML age 70 years were treated with GO. Although
the overall CR rate was 14%, none of the 26 patients
with high-risk cytogenetics achieved CR. The CR rate
for patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics was
30%, suggesting that this patient subset may benefit
from GO treatment as opposed to those patients with
high-risk cytogenetics. The beneficial effect of GO in
patients with intermediate cytogenetic risk has been
reported from the Medical Research Study AML15,
which randomly assigned patients aged <60 years to
receive induction chemotherapy  GO/consolidation
 GO.16 Preliminary analysis on 1113 randomized
patients demonstrated a significant reduction in recurrence risk and improvement in disease-free survival in
patients with favorable or intermediate-risk cytogenetics, but not in patients with adverse cytogenetics.
Although no patients with favorable cytogenetics were
included in the current study, these patients would
also be expected to benefit from GO.
The EORTC Leukemia Group in collaboration
with the Italian Cooperative Group GIMEMA conducted
a phase 2 study to assess the therapeutic activity and the
toxicity profile of GO in older patients with newly diagnosed AML.10 Treatment-related mortality varied by age:
0% in patients ages 61 to 75 years versus 32% (7 of 22) in
patients aged >75 years, suggesting that the GO dose and
schedule is too toxic for patients aged >75 years. Similarly, in our study, the median age of the patients dying
from treatment was 76 years.

An inherent limitation of this single institution retrospective study is that the basis for use of GO, as opposed to
alternative options, is effectively unknown, and a comparable control group for comparison is unavailable. More specifically, comorbidity and performance status at the time of
treatment might have played a role in the decision making,
but regardless of this, we have no data on either 1 of these
variables. In addition, because not all newly diagnosed
AML patients at our institution received GO, one has to
consider that the results of the study could differ. Whether
our assessment of GO would be materially changed
(ie, much poorer or better recurrence-free and overall survival would be found) cannot be assessed in the absence of
data on the eligible newly diagnosed AML patients who did
not receive GO. Countervailing strengths of our study are
the inclusion of all patients (ie, an unselected patient series)
with data regarding several key risk factors for response and
survival, and our adjustment for these factors when needed.
The role of GO as a single agent in previously untreated
AML is still under investigation. In 1 study, CR and survival
rates in newly diagnosed AML patients (median age, 71
years; range, 65-89 years) treated with GO were compared
with a historical cohort of 31 AML patients treated at the
same institution with idarubicin and cytarabine.12 A higher
CR rate (48%) and a superior survival was associated with
chemotherapy-treated patients compared with GO-treated
patients. Based on this comparison, newly diagnosed elderly
AML patients were believed to benefit more from induction
chemotherapy than GO treatment. However, a prospective
randomized clinical trial would be required to determine
which approach is optimal.
Intensive chemotherapy may not be appropriate for
many elderly AML patients, largely due to treatment-related
morbidity and mortality. Low-dose cytarabine has been

studied in elderly patients, producing superior CR rates
compared with hydroxyurea (18% vs 1%) and better overall
survival.17 However, patients with adverse cytogenetics did
not benefit from treatment with cytarabine. Several new
novel agents have entered clinical trials, and some have
shown promising results. The therapeutic efficacy of the
hypomethylating agents decitabine and azacitidine as firstline therapy in newly diagnosed patients with AML has been
evaluated in recent prospective studies, with reported CR
ranging from 24% to 50% and relatively lower toxicity and
mortality rates.18-20 Furthermore, the combination of GO
with decitabine and azacitidine has been evaluated in AML
patients, and preliminary reports suggest that this combination appears to be safe and effective.21,22
Our experience suggests that GO should be considered as a first-line treatment option in older patients with
AML who cannot tolerate high-dose induction chemotherapy, but who have intermediate-risk cytogenetics.
