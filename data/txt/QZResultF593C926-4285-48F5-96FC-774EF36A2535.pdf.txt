Abstract
Defects in apoptotic pathway contribute to uncontrolled
proliferation of cancer cells and confer resistance to chemotherapy. Growth arrest and DNA damage inducible, alpha
(GADD45a) is up-regulated on docetaxel treatment and may
contribute to docetaxel-mediated cytotoxicity. We examined
the mechanism of regulation of GADD45a in prostate cancer
cells and the effect of its up-regulation on sensitivity to
docetaxel chemotherapy. Expression of GADD45a in PC3 cells
was higher than that in Du145 and LNCaP cells (17- and 12fold, respectively; P < 0.05). Although the proximal promoter
region was unmethylated in all three cell lines, methylation of
a 4 CpG region upstream of the proximal promoter correlated
inversely with gene expression levels. Methylation was
reversed by treatment of Du145 and LNCaP cells with DNA
methyltransferase inhibitors, leading to reactivation of
GADD45a expression in these cells. The 5¶ 4 CpG region was
also frequently methylated in prostate cancer tissues. Methylation of this region correlated inversely with gene expression
in prostate cancer and benign prostate tissues. The methyl
binding protein MeCP2 was associated with the methylated 4
CpGs in Du145 cells, and knockdown of MeCP2 in these cells
(Du145 MeCP2 ) led to a significantly increased expression of
GADD45a (3-fold; P = 0.035) without affecting the methylation
status of the gene. Enhanced sensitivity to docetaxel was
observed by up-regulation of GADD45a in Du145 cells by
recombinant expression of GADD45a or pretreatment with 5azacytidine. Our results show that GADD45a is epigenetically
repressed and is a potential target for treatment of prostate
cancer. [Cancer Res 2009;69(4):1527–35]

Introduction
Apoptosis or programmed cell death is a crucial mechanism for
maintenance of cell homeostasis. During carcinogenesis, there is
increased cell proliferation and development of resistance to
cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents (1). The molecular mechanisms
of this phenomenon are yet to be completely elucidated. It is
believed that defects in apoptotic pathways play a key role in
tumorigenesis. Genes involved in cell cycle control, apoptosis
signaling, and DNA repair become methylated and epigenetically
inactivated in most cancers (1–4).

Recently, there have been reports of methylation-mediated
deregulation of proapoptotic genes, which could provide a
mechanism through which tumor cells avoid apoptosis (5, 6).
Growth arrest and DNA damage inducible, alpha (GADD45a) plays
an important role in cellular response to DNA damage because it is
involved in DNA repair, maintenance of genomic stability, cell cycle
control, and apoptosis (7). GADD45a blocks G2-M transition
thereby causing cell cycle arrest in response to DNA-damaging
agents such as UV radiation, ionizing radiation, and methylmethane sulfonate (8). The role of GADD45a in G2-M arrest is
shown by its ability to interact with Cdc2 kinase resulting in
inhibition of Cdc2/cyclin B1 complex formation, which is required
for G2-M transition during cell cycle progression (9). Inhibition of
growth by GADD45a occurs both in cell lines with functional p53
and those with a negative p53 status (7). GADD45a expression is
critical for c-jun NH2-terminal kinase activation and apoptosis in
tumor cells (10–12). Recombinant GADD45a expression in tumor
cell lines by transfection reduces cell proliferation (13). Treatment
of cells with genotoxic agents up-regulates GADD45a expression
resulting in induction of apoptosis (14).
Previous studies showed that GADD45a was down-regulated in
prostate cancer compared with benign prostate tissues. Downregulation of gene expression was not associated with hypermethylation of the proximal promoter region (15). In this study, we
show that transcriptional repression of GADD45a in Du145
prostate cancer cells occurs by an atypical methylation of 4 CpGs
located upstream of the proximal promoter region. Methylation of
the 5¶ 4 CpG region is a frequent event in prostate cancer and
correlates inversely with gene expression in prostate cancer and
benign prostate tissues. Further, down-regulation of GADD45a in
Du145 involves interaction of MeCP2 with GADD45a promoter.
Induction of GADD45a by treatment of Du145 cells with DNA
methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor increases sensitivity to
docetaxel chemotherapy, thus identifying the role of GADD45a as
a potential target gene in prostate cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. Du145, LNCaP, and PC3 prostate cancer cells were routinely
cultured in RPMI 1640 (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (Invitrogen), 2 mmol/L glutamine (Invitrogen), and 100 Ag/mL
penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen).
Tissue specimens. Tissue specimens used in this study were obtained
from prostate cancer cases and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) controls
as previously described (15, 16).
Drug treatment. 5-Azacytidine was provided by Pharmion Corporation
and 5-azadeoxycytidine was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Du145 cells
were treated with varying concentrations of 5-azacytidine or 5-azadeoxycytidine for 72 h, after which RNA/DNA/protein were extracted. For
determining the sensitivity to docetaxel, Du145 cells were seeded for 24 h,

after which they were treated with 5-azacytidine for 72 h followed by
5 nmol/L docetaxel for 72 h.
Plasmids and transfection. pSuppressor/MeCP2 siRNA, SureSilencing
MBD2 shRNA, and pCMV/GADD45a plasmids were obtained from
Imgenex, SuperArray Bioscience Corporation, and Origene Technologies,
Inc., respectively. Transfection was carried out using Amaxa Nucleofection
system (Amaxa, Inc.). To generate stable clones of Du145 and LNCaP
MeCP2 cells, transfected cells were selected with 350 Ag/mL G418. Stable
clones were then maintained in medium containing 350 Ag/mL G418.
Stable clones of Du145 and LNCaP MBD2 cells were generated by
transfection followed by selection in medium containing 5 and 2.5 Ag/mL
puromycin.
Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. RNA extracted from untreated and drug treated cells using RNA Stat 60 (TelTest, Inc.) was reverse
transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase
(USB Corp.). Real-time PCR amplification was done in triplicates with cDNA
using primers for GADD45a. The average C t was then used to quantitate
relative mRNA levels by the comparative C t method. RNA from untreated
cells was used as a calibrator. Both samples and calibrator were normalized
to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The primer

sequences for GADD45a are 5¶-CGCCTGTGAGTGAGTGC-3¶ ( forward) and
5¶-CTTATCCATCCTTTCGGTCTT-3¶ (reverse), and for GAPDH, 5¶-GCTGAGTACGTCGTGGAGTC-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-GGGGCAGAGATGATGACC-3¶
(reverse). The PCR reaction was carried out in a volume of 25 AL using
iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories) on MyiQ Single-Color RealTime PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Expression of
GADD45a and of the reference gene TBP in tissues was done by real-time
reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) on an ABI 7900 instrument (Applied
Biosystems) using assay systems supplied by the same company, as
described (15).
Western blotting. Whole cell lysates were prepared using the M-PER
Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (Pierce). Protein concentrations of
the lysate were determined using bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent
(Pierce). For Western blot analysis, the proteins were resolved on a 4% to
20% SDS-PAGE gel and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The blot
was then probed with rabbit anti-human GADD45a antibody (1:200
dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), detected with antirabbit immunoglobulin-horseradish peroxidase (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp.), and
visualized with SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate
kit (Pierce). To ensure equal loading in all the lanes, the blot was stripped

and probed with antibody against housekeeping genes, anti-actin (SigmaAldrich) or anti-tubulin (Cell Signaling).
Immunofluorescence staining for MeCP2. Du145 wild-type (wt) and
MeCP2 cells were seeded in Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc
International). Cells fixed in formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1%
Triton X-100 were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin prepared in PBS.
Cells were then stained with rabbit anti-MeCP2 antibody followed by
staining with secondary antibody conjugated with Texas red and visualized
under a fluorescence microscope.
Bisulfite genomic sequencing and methylation analysis. DNA from
cell lines, primary prostate cancer tissues, and benign prostate tissues were
extracted using DNA Stat 60 (TelTest). Bisulfite conversion of the DNA was
carried out as previously described (17). In brief, after bisulfite treatment, the
DNA template was amplified with the following primers sets:
5¶-AAAGTTTTTTATTTTTAATGGTTTT-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-ATCAACCTACTCCAACAATTTAACC-3¶ (reverse) for the proximal promoter region,
and 5¶-TTGGGTTGTTAGGGATTTTTATATG-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-AAAATCTTTTCCACAAAAAACAAAA-3¶ (reverse) for the 5¶ 4 CpG region.
Sequencing of the PCR-amplified product was done using the reverse
primer. The [a-33P]ddNTP terminator kit (USB) was used for sequencing.
The sequencing gel was dried and exposed to a phosphorimager screen (BioRad Laboratories). Methylation analysis was carried out by quantitating the
intensity of C and T bands using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad
Laboratories) and calculating the percentage of C/(C + T) bands, as
previously described (18).
Bisulfite sequencing and methylation-sensitive single nucleotide
primer extension analysis of tissue samples. DNA was extracted from
prostate cancer and benign prostate tissues by the Qiagen blood and tissue
DNA extraction kit with extended proteinase K treatment. A positive
control for methylated DNA was generated by treating human leukocyte
DNA from a healthy donor with SssI CpG methylase (New England Biolabs)
according to the instruction of the supplier. Complete methylation was
ensured by digestion with HpaII. Bisulfite treatment was carried out using
the CpGenome DNA Modification Kit (Q-Biogene). The GADD45a 5¶ 4 CpG
region was amplified using the primers described above. For bisulfite
sequencing, PCR products were cloned into the pCR4 vector using the
TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Successful cloning of the PCR product

was verified by restriction enzyme digestion, and multiple clones from each
sample were sequenced at the central facility of the Center for Biological
and Medical Research of the Heinrich Heine University by standard
methods. Methylation-sensitive single nucleotide primer extension (MSSNuPE) reactions were carried out using 1 AL of the PCR product in a 25-AL
reaction mixture containing 1 PCR buffer (Sigma), 1 Amol/L of SNuPE
primer, 1 ACi of [32P]dATP or [32P]dGTP, and 1 unit of Taq polymerase
(Sigma; refs. 19, 20). The primers used for MS-SNuPE analysis were as
follows: CpG1, 5¶-AAACTAATCTAC-3¶; CpG2, 5¶-AACTAAAAAATC-3¶; CpG3,
5¶-TTCCCACCTACCC-3¶ (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation and real-time PCR. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays were carried out with the kit from Upstate
Biotechnology as described previously (21). Real-time PCR amplification of
bound DNA was done in triplicate using 10 AL of the immunoprecipitated
DNA using primers amplifying the GADD45a 4 CpG region.
Cell viability assay. Cell viability after drug treatment was analyzed using
fluorescein di-O -acetate. Viable cells incorporate the nonfluorescent
fluorescein di-O-acetate and rapidly hydrolyze it using acetyl esterase activity
to fluorescein, which is retained within the cell. Nonviable cells no longer have
esterase activity and will not be fluorescently stained. Flourescence cell
sorting was done in a Beckman Coulter XL flow cytometer (22).
Apoptosis assay. Apoptotic stress after drug treatment was measured by
Annexin V/propidium iodide staining using APO-AF Annexin V-FITC
apoptosis detection kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Fluorescence cell sorting was
carried out as described above. Annexin V-FITC is detected as green
fluorescence and propidium iodide staining is detected as red fluorescence.
Statistical analysis. Experiments were done in triplicates or quadruplicates. A two-sided t test or z test was used to compare two-group
means and P V 0.05 was considered significant. Comparisons against a
reference group are reported in the text as P values, and significance is
displayed in figures as follows: NS, nonsignificant; *, 0.01 < P < 0.05; **, 0.001
< P < 0.01; and ***, P < 0.001.

GADD45a has been shown to induce apoptosis in Du145 and PC3
prostate cancer cell lines (11); hence, we explored the role of
GADD45a as a potential target for chemotherapy. We examined
GADD45a expression in the three prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP,
Du145, and PC3, by real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting
analyses. Compared with Du145, we found that LNCaP expressed
similarly low levels (P = 0.756) whereas PC3 showed significantly
elevated levels of GADD45a expression (17-fold, P = 0.029; Fig. 1A).
Because promoter methylation is commonly associated with
silencing of gene expression, we examined the methylation status
of the GADD45a promoter region in Du145, PC3, and LNCaP
prostate cancer cells by bisulfite genomic sequencing. CpG islands
in the proximal promoter region were unmethylated in all three cell
lines (Fig. 1B). However, unlike known patterns of methylation of
CpG islands, an atypical methylation pattern was observed. Similar
to an earlier study in breast cancer cells (23), only 4 CpGs located
f700 bases upstream of the transcription start site were
methylated in Du145 and LNCaP whereas they were unmethylated
in PC3 (Fig. 1C). The average methylation of 3 CpGs was 71%, 84%,
and 27% in Du145, LNCaP, and PC3, respectively (Fig. 1D). Levels of

expression of GADD45a in these cell lines correlated inversely with
the methylation levels of CpGs in the 5¶ region.
Treatment with DNMT inhibitors reactivates GADD45a
expression in Du145 cells. Several in vitro and in vivo studies
have shown that treatment with inhibitors of DNMTs results in
DNA demethylation and subsequent reactivation of otherwise
silenced genes (24–26). To confirm the role of methylation of the
5¶ 4 CpG region in transcriptional repression of GADD45a, we
analyzed the expression of GADD45a after treatment of Du145 cells
with DNMT inhibitors, 5-azacytidine and 5-azadeoxycytidine.
Levels of GADD45a mRNA and protein levels of GADD45a
increased significantly after drug treatment (Fig. 2C and D),
concomitant with demethylation of the 4 CpGs (Fig. 2A and B).
When compared with untreated Du145 control, we observed a
7-fold increase in expression of GADD45a in cells treated with 5azacytidine (P = 0.049) and an 11-fold increase with 5-azadeoxycytidine (P = 0.000). Similar results were observed in LNCaP cells
when treated with DNMT inhibitors (data not shown). These
results support the role of methylation in repressing GADD45a
gene expression in Du145 and LNCaP cells.

GADD45a as a Potential Therapeutic Target in Prostate Cancer

antibody and detected by ECL. To ensure equal loading of the samples, the blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-actin antibody. Immunofluorescence
staining (as described in Materials and Methods) showed reduced expression of MeCP2 in Du145 MeCP2 cells compared with Du145 wt cells. C, chromatin
immunoprecipitation analysis showing reduced binding of MeCP2 to GADD45a 4 CpG region in Du145 MeCP2 cells. Formaldehyde-fixed chromatin from Du145 wt

MeCP2 was calculated by normalizing to no-antibody control. D, increased GADD45a expression in Du145 MeCP2 cells. RNA extracted from cells was reverse

Methylation of GADD45a 5¶ 4 CpG region is a frequent event in
prostate cancer and correlates inversely with gene expression
in primary prostate cancer and benign prostate tissues.
Previous results showed that GADD45a was down-regulated in
prostate cancer compared with benign prostate tissues (15).
However, only proximal promoter methylation was evaluated and
this region was found to be unmethylated in both cancer tissues and
benign specimens. To determine if methylation of GADD45a
5¶ 4 CpG region is present in prostate tumors, we compared the
methylation of GADD45a 4 CpG region in 22 prostate cancer tissues
and 10 BPH tissues by bisulfite sequencing (Fig. 3A). We found a
significant increase in methylation of this 4 CpG region in prostate
cancer tissues compared with BPH (mean of 47% in prostate cancer
tissues versus 26% in BPH, P = 0.001; Fig. 3B). Methylation of proximal promoter region was evaluated in randomly selected samples.
These showed lack of methylation in proximal promoter despite
methylation of the 4 CpG region (data not shown). Hence, atypical
methylation of GADD45a 4 CpG region is present in primary prostate
cancer tissues and is not confined to prostate cancer cell lines.

www.aacrjournals.org

To correlate GADD45a expression with methylation of the 5¶ 4
CpG region, we examined methylation in five prostate cancer
tissues with high GADD45a expression, four prostate cancer tissues
with low GADD45a expression, and five benign prostate tissues
from the previous study (15). All five benign tissues were found to
have high GADD45a expression. MS-SNuPE quantitation showed
that methylation in each of 3 CpGs is significantly higher in tumor
samples (average methylation of 3 CpGs, 52%) than in normal
tissue samples (average methylation of 3 CpGs, 24%; P < 0.0001;
Fig. 3C, data for CpG2 shown). Methylation of GADD45a 5¶ 4 CpG
region correlated inversely with gene expression in combined
analysis of all tissue samples (n = 14, Pearson’s correlation
coefficient = 0.537, P = 0.047; Fig. 3D). These results were also
independently confirmed by bisulfite sequencing (see Supplementary Fig. S1).
Transcriptional repression of GADD45a occurs via
interaction of MeCP2 with its methylated promoter. Interaction
of transcriptional repressor proteins with methylated DNA either
directly by the methyl-binding domain (MBD) or indirectly by

interaction with other proteins contributes to transcriptional
repression (27–29). To elucidate the mechanism of transcriptional
silencing of GADD45a in prostate cancer cells, we analyzed the
binding pattern of MeCP2 to the methylated 5¶ 4 CpG region
upstream of GADD45a promoter in Du145 and LNCaP cells using
chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. MeCP2 was found to
interact with the methylated 4 CpG region in Du145 cells (mean
percent binding: 310% normalized to no-antibody control,
P = 0.002) in Du145 (Fig. 4A) but not in LNCaP cells (data not
shown). In contrast, no binding of MBD2 to this region was
observed in Du145 cells (data not shown).
It has been reported that knockdown of MeCP2 by siRNA
transfection restores the expression of epigenetically silenced genes
(30). To examine the role of MeCP2 in methylation-mediated
transcriptional regulation of GADD45a in Du145 cells, we carried
out transient knockdown of MeCP2 using a MeCP2 siRNA vector in
Du145 cells and examined the changes in the expression pattern of
GADD45a. GADD45a expression in Du145 MeCP2 was increased
by f2-fold compared with wt Du145 cells, suggesting that MeCP2
interaction with the GADD45a 5¶ region has functional significance
(data not shown). Consistent with chromatin immunoprecipitation
analysis, transient transfection of MBD2 siRNA did not alter the
gene expression levels in Du145 cells (data not shown). No
enhancement of GADD45a expression was observed in LNCaP cells
on stable knockdown of MeCP2 (data not shown). This was
consistent with the chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis data
that showed that MeCP2 does not bind to the GADD45a 4 CpG
region in these cells (data not shown).
We further confirmed these findings by generating a stable
Du145 MeCP2 cell line in which MeCP2 was knocked down by
transfection with pSuppressor/MeCP2 siRNA plasmid. Reduced
expression of MeCP2 in Du145 MeCP2 cells was observed by
immunofluorescence staining with anti-MeCP2 antibody and also
by Western blotting analysis, thus confirming the stable knockdown of MeCP2 in these cells (Fig. 4B). Consistent with these
results, we found that the binding of MeCP2 to the GADD45a
promoter is reduced in Du145 MeCP2 cells (mean of 310% in
Du145 wt versus 47% in MeCP2 , P = 0.002; Fig. 4C). Further, the
levels of GADD45a increased by f3-fold in Du145 MeCP2 cells as
compared with Du145 wt cells (P = 0.035; Fig. 4D) although
methylation of the 4 CpGs remained unaltered (data not shown).
To elucidate the mechanism of GADD45a repression in LNCaP
cells, we examined interaction of other MBDs using chromatin
immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that interaction of MBD2
with GADD45a promoter and stable depletion of MBD2 by siRNA
vector resulted in enhanced expression of GADD45a gene (data not
shown).
Recombinant GADD45A expression results in increased
sensitivity of Du145 cells to docetaxel. Up-regulation of
GADD45a is a key event in docetaxel-induced apoptosis (10, 11,
31). Because GADD45a is down-regulated in Du145 cells, we
hypothesized that expression of GADD45a would enhance
sensitivity to docetaxel. Du145 cells were transiently transfected
with pCMV/GADD45a or mock transfected with empty pCMV
vector. Western blotting analysis confirmed the expression of
GADD45a in these GADD45a-transfected cells (Fig. 5A). Increased
apoptosis as measured by Annexin V/propidium iodide staining
was observed in Du145 cells expressing GADD45a as compared
with mock-transfected cells when treated with docetaxel for
72 hours (47% versus 31%, P < 0.001) as well as when left untreated
(mean of 12% versus 4%, P = 0.003; Fig. 5B and C). Cells expressing

lysates prepared from these cells were resolved on a 4% to 20% SDS
polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was

GADD45a as a Potential Therapeutic Target in Prostate Cancer

augmenting docetaxel-mediated apoptosis in Du145 prostate
cancer cells.
Up-regulation of GADD45a by pretreatment with 5-azacytidine increases sensitivity of Du145 cells to docetaxel.
Combination treatments can improve the antitumor activity of
chemotherapeutic drugs (32). We hypothesized that induction of
GADD45a expression by 5-azacytidine pretreatment would increase
sensitivity of Du145 cells to docetaxel chemotherapy. We performed
time and dose response kinetics in Du145 cells to docetaxel and
5-azacytidine (Fig. 6A and B). Based on these results, we chose the
subcytotoxic dose of 1 Amol/L 5-azacytidine for pretreatment of the
cells. As shown in Fig. 6C, we observed an increased sensitivity to
docetaxel treatment. Annexin V/propidium iodide staining followed
by flow cytometry showed that cells pretreated with 5-azacytidine
showed higher apoptosis with docetaxel than previously untreated
cells. The mean apoptotic fraction was 12% in 5-azacytidine–treated
cells versus 4% in untreated cells (P = 0.006) and 25% in 5azacytidine pretreated cells + docetaxel versus 16% in untreated
cells + docetaxel (P = 0.001). Similar results were obtained with

fluorescein di-O-acetate cell viability assay (Fig. 6D). The additive
effect of 5-azacytidine and docetaxel is likely a result of upregulation of GADD45a by 5-azacytidine treatment. We also
examined the ability of 5¶-azacytidine to enhance sensitivity to
docetaxel treatment of LNCaP cells. The results were similar to
those with Du145 cells (data not shown).

Discussion
This article describes epigenetic regulation of GADD45a in
prostate cancer cells and its potential role in docetaxel sensitivity.
The key findings in this article are as follows. GADD45a expression
in prostate cancer cells correlates inversely with an atypical CpG
methylation upstream of transcription start site. Methylation of
GADD45a occurs more frequently in prostate cancer tissues as
compared with BPH tissues. Methylation of the 5¶ 4 CpG region
correlates inversely with GADD45a expression in prostate cancer
and benign prostate tissues. Transcriptional repression of
GADD45a in Du145 cells involves interaction of MeCP2 with

drug and cell viability was assayed using fluorescein di-O -acetate (FDA ) over 72 h. C and D, increased sensitivity of Du145 cells to docetaxel by pretreatment
with 5-azacytidine. Cells seeded in 12-well plates were treated with 1 Amol/L 5-azacytidine for 72 h, after which they were treated with 5 nmol/L docetaxel for 72 h.
In parallel, control cells were left untreated for 72 h, after which they were treated with 5 nmol/L docetaxel for 72 h. Cytotoxicity was assayed by Annexin V/propidium
iodide staining and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells treated with 5-azacytidine and docetaxel showed increased apoptosis compared with cells treated with
5-azacytidine alone (61% versus 34%, P = 0.005; C ). Cells seeded in 12-well plates were treated with 1 Amol/L 5-azacytidine for 72 h, after which they were treated with
5 nmol/L docetaxel for 72 h. Cell viability was evaluated using fluorescein di-O -acetate followed by flow cytometry (D ).

the 5¶ 4 CpG region of the gene. Induction of GADD45a expression
by down-regulation of MeCP2 or by treatment with DNMT
inhibitors leads to enhanced sensitivity of Du145 cells to docetaxel
chemotherapy.
Although methylation-mediated inactivation of genes is attributed to methylation of dense CpG islands in the proximal promoter
region (1–3, 6, 33, 34), a few examples to the contrary exist. Early
evidence that sparse methylation could lead to transcriptional
repression arose from the observation that in vitro methylation of
human g-globin and mouse a-globin sequences lacking CpG
clusters resulted in loss of gene expression. Similar results were
obtained when the human a-globin promoter with dense CpG
clusters was methylated to a lower density (35). Atypical DNA
methylation was described in the case of the APAF1 gene, which is
transcriptionally repressed in malignant melanoma. No methylation could be detected in its core promoter region. However, gene
expression was restored by treatment with DNMT inhibitors,
suggesting that methylation affects CpGs located outside of the
promoter region (36). Conventional techniques to identify epigenetically regulated genes include MS-PCR and bisulfite sequencing
of CpG islands located in the proximal promoter region of the gene.
Often, these approaches do not address sparsely populated CpGs
that are situated far upstream of the transcription start site.
Another approach to identify epigenetically regulated genes is use
of expression arrays to detect genes that are induced by 5azacytidine. Using this strategy, GADD45a methylation outside of
the proximal promoter region was detected in breast cancer (23).
In the previous study, although GADD45a repression was observed
in prostate cancer, evaluation of the proximal promoter region
failed to detect methylated CpG dinucleotides (15). Consistent with
these results, we did not detect methylation in the CpG rich
proximal promoter region in the three prostate cancer cell lines
analyzed. Instead, gene expression was regulated by methylation of
4 CpGs upstream of the proximal promoter region. This pattern of
methylation is atypical because it occurs in a sparsely distributed
CpG region situated far away from the actual promoter sequence.
Moreover, these 4 CpGs are not contained within any recognized
response element. We observed increased levels of methylation of
GADD45a 4 CpG region in prostate cancer tissues compared with
BPH tissues. Further, methylation levels of GADD45a 4 CpG region
inversely correlated with gene expression in prostate tissues,
suggesting the functional significance of methylation of the 4 CpG
region in regulation of GADD45a expression. Therefore, methylation analysis of CpG dinucleotides away from the proximal
promoter region may also be important for genes suspected to
be repressed by methylation.
Epigenetic suppression of transcription involves proteins that
bind specifically to methylated DNA, in particular MBD proteins.
Transcriptional regulation by MBDs occurs by binding to
methylated DNA, thus acting as a ‘‘locking’’ mechanism stabilizing
gene repression caused by other components of chromatin
modification systems (29). MeCP2, the archetypical MBD protein,
has been shown to play a role in epigenetic transcriptional
repression mechanism (37). MeCP2 binds to methylated CpGs of
the InBa promoter leading to the formation of a transcriptional
repression complex that silences expression of the gene in
myofibroblasts. Knockdown of MeCP2 led to enhanced InBa
promoter activity and restoration of mRNA and protein expression
in these cells (30). In Du145 cells, GADD45a was found to be
transcriptionally regulated via binding of MeCP2 to the methylated
GADD45a 5¶ 4 CpG region. Transcriptional repression of the gene

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (4). February 15, 2009

was alleviated by knocking down MeCP2. Knockdown of MBD2,
however, did not restore GADD45a expression in these cells. The
specificity of binding of MeCP2 to sparsely methylated GADD45a
sequence in Du145 could be explained by the fact that MeCP2
binds to single methylated CpG whereas MBD2/MeCP1 requires
densely methylated CpG islands for binding (27). We found that the
effect of MeCP2 knockdown on GADD45a expression was cell line
specific because in LNCaP cells, there was no interaction of MeCP2
with GADD45a 5¶ 4 CpG region and, hence, no effect of MeCP2
knockdown on GADD45a expression. Conversely, in LNCaP cells,
MBD2 interaction with GADD45a promoter was observed and
depletion of MBD2 by siRNA vector resulted in enhanced
expression of GADD45a gene. It has been postulated that a gene
could be associated with different MBDs in different cells (29).
Moreover, one of the models for gene regulation by MBDs proposes
a random interaction of MBDs, thus accounting for the functional
redundancy of these proteins (29). This explains why there are few
instances of loss of a specific MBD protein resulting in overexpression of corresponding target genes.
Docetaxel is the only known chemotherapeutic agent shown to
improve survival in patients with hormone-refractory prostate
cancer as established by randomized controlled trials and therefore
approved by the Food and Drug Administration for this use (38, 39).
It has been known that docetaxel binds to microtubules inhibiting
cancer cell proliferation (40). However, the precise molecular
mechanisms for inhibiting cancer cell growth by docetaxel have
not been fully elucidated. Resistance to chemotherapy, especially to
docetaxel, has presented itself as a major obstacle in treatment of
advanced prostate cancer. Currently, there is no standard of care
defined for such patients. There is a continuous search for new
treatment regimens to improve the efficacy of chemotherapeutic
agents. Evidence from literature suggests that disruption of the
apoptotic pathway seems to be a major mechanism of uncontrolled
cell proliferation as well as resistance to chemotherapeutic agents
(1). Gene expression profiling revealed that treatment of cells
with docetaxel increased GADD45a expression, thus indicating
GADD45a as a key element in docetaxel mediated apoptosis (14).
Consistent with this observation, we found that sensitivity to
docetaxel was enhanced in Du145 cells expressing GADD45a as
compared with mock-transfected cells. Du145 cells treated with
5-azacytidine before docetaxel treatment showed increased sensitivity to docetaxel treatment likely due to increased GADD45a
expression. Our results suggest that combination treatment with a
DNMT inhibitor and docetaxel may improve the efficacy of
docetaxel in treatment of metastatic prostate cancer.
