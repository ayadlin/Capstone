ABSTRACT:
Cyclotherapy is a promising endeavor to improve cancer treatment by tackling the
dose-limiting side effects of chemotherapy, especially for cancers harboring mutations
in the TP53 tumor suppressor. In this particular context, pre-treatment with a p53
activator halts proliferation in healthy tissue, while leaving the p53-deficient tumor
susceptible to conventional chemotherapy.

Cyclotherapy is a promising endeavor to improve
cancer treatment by tackling the dose-limiting side effects
of chemotherapy. The origins of chemotherapy can be
traced back to WWII, when it was accidentally discovered
that nitrogen mustard transiently suppressed lymphoma.
Over the decades that followed, the principle that highly
toxic compounds can be used to combat cancer led to the
identification and subsequent clinical approval of a series
of “classic” chemotherapeutics [1, 2]. Early examples
include the still widely used vincristine (Oncovin®) and
dactinomycin (Cosmegen®). The majority of anticancer
drugs that are on the market today belong to the same
category as these; that is, they are cytotoxic compounds
with cancer-nonspecific targets such as tubulin or DNA
[3, 4]. The most vulnerable tissues are those with a high
proliferative ratio, independent of whether they are normal
or cancerous. Due to this lack of selectivity, side effects
are prevalent and patients suffer from bone marrow
suppression, neutropenia, anemia, nausea and vomiting,
amongst other ailments. In addition, they are subjected to
an increased risk of developing second tumors later in life.
Advances in the understanding of the molecular and
cellular biology of cancer are making the identification
of novel therapeutics targeting cancer- or tissue-specific
traits possible. In-depth knowledge about the genetic
alterations responsible for chronic myelogenous leukemia,
for instance, enabled the rational design of imatinib
mesylate (Gleevec®) [5]. In addition to the development
of more selective anticancer agents, research efforts are
also focused on improving the cure rate with existing
drugs, for example, by optimizing drug combinations
or refining drug delivery to a tumor. Another promising
strategy aimed at increasing the therapeutic window of
chemotherapy involves reducing the sensitivity of healthy

tissue to anticancer agents. For cytotoxic drugs, which
indiscriminately target cycling cells, chemoprotection
can be achieved by selectively inducing a transient cell
cycle arrest in normal cells. This concept, known as
cyclotherapy [6, 7], is illustrated in Figure 1 for cancers
harboring mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor. In
this particular context, pre-treatment with a p53 activator
halts proliferation in healthy tissue, while leaving the p53deficient tumor susceptible to conventional chemotherapy
[8-10].
For cyclotherapy to have the desired effects, i.e.,
shielding normal cells without diminishing the anticancer
efficacy of the treatment, the protectant−therapeutic
combination has to be chosen with great care. Cell
cycle arrest does not guarantee protection from every
cytotoxic agent. For instance, arresting cells in S-phase
prior to exposure to the nucleotide analogue gemcitabine
(Gemzar®) is likely to lead to synergistic cell killing
rather than protection. Moreover, chemoprotection is
unlikely to be effective if the anticancer drug outlives
the cytostatic effect in cells. This is the case with classic
DNA crosslinkers and intercalators, whose deleterious
effects become apparent when cells re-enter the cell cycle.
Preclinical p53-based cyclotherapy studies using cisplatin
(Platinol®) and doxorubin (Adriamycin®) as second drug
were indeed unsuccessful.
In a recent publication [10], we have investigated
a series of cyclotherapy regimes involving four smallmolecule p53 activators, tenovin-6 [11], leptomycin B
(LMB) [12], nutlin-3 [13] and low doses of dactinomycin
(LDactD) [14]. On normal cells in culture, these
compounds have a reversible cytostatic effect, leading to
the accumulation of cells in G1 and G2, and efficiently
shield them from the cytotoxicity and nuclear aberrations

LDactD. However, from our systematic analysis [10],
nutlin-3 emerged as the most promising chemoprotectant
overall, showing good and highly-selective protection of
normal cells from each anticancer drug tested, which is in
agreement with previous data [8, 9, 15, 16].
Translating the concept of cyclotherapy into a
clinical reality will involve a number of major challenges,
including the following:
(1) Further research is needed to identify suitable
compounds to be used as chemoprotectants. Ideal
candidates ought to elicit a reversible cytostatic response
in normal cells over a wide range of concentrations. LMB
is a very attractive compound from this point of view,
since it is effective between 0.2 and 400 nM in cell culture
[10]. Also, selectivity is critical and chemoprotectants
should not induce cell cycle arrest in tumor cells. Our
observations suggest that LDactD, for example, has a
relatively narrow therapeutic window. For both normal
and p53-mutant cancer cells, dactinomycin is cytotoxic at
doses beyond 4 nM and mildly cytostatic below 2 nM [10,
17].
(2) The cyclotherapy principle needs to be further
validated in vivo. To date, a sole publication has reported
that nutlin-3 can efficiently prevent neutropenia in mice
exposed to an anticancer agent [16].
(3) Cell culture studies strongly suggest that
optimal cyclotherapy regimes will vary between patients.
Therefore, recent advances in the development of freely
available databases profiling the drug sensitivity of
large panels of cancer cell lines and high-throughput
technologies for screening patient samples are of great
interest [18-21]. These constitute substantial progress
towards the ultimate goal of individually tailored
therapies.
(4) The clinical approval of potential
chemoprotectants constitutes a major time-limiting step.
Tenovin-6 is a novel compound still under preclinical

investigation [11], while a nutlin-like compound is
currently undergoing phase 1 clinical trials. LMB’s
progress as a possible therapeutic is hindered by early
reports of high toxicity in vivo as well as by this natural
compound’s lack of a ‘composition of matter’ patent.
The future does, however, look brighter for novel LMB
analogues [22]. Finally, an appealing alternative is
to exploit drugs that are already in the clinic, such as
dactinomycin, as chemoprotectants.
Since it is so frequently mutated in human cancers,
the p53 tumour suppressor constitutes a highly attractive
target for selective chemoprotection [23-25]. However,
it is important to note here that other pathways can also
be potentially exploited to selectively induce cell cycle
arrest in normal tissue (cyclotherapy) or to lower its
sensitivity via other chemoprotection strategies [26-31].
Apontes et al., [26], for example, explored the use of
the immunosuppressant rapamycin (inhibitor of mTOR
signalling) and the anti-diabetic drug metformin (activator
of AMP kinase) as chemoprotectants. Furthermore,
Raffaghello et al., [29] reported that short-term serum
deprivation selectively protects normal cells in culture
from the cytotoxicity of cyclophosphamide (Endoxan®)
and improves the survival of mice exposed to high
doses of etoposide (Eposin®), and preliminary dietary
intervention studies in patients revealed a decrease in a
range of side effects with fasting [32]. The differential
effect of starvation on normal and cancer cells is mediated,
at least in part, by insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I)
[33]. In another recent publication, Pabla et al., [28, 34]
identified protein kinase C δ (PKCδ) as a key player in
the nephrotoxicity and kidney damage associated with
cisplatin-based cancer therapy and effectively exploited
PKCδ inhibition to reduce cisplatin-induced apoptosis in
renal proximal tubular cells in mice.
In summary, cyclotherapy could improve treatment
outcomes by making it possible to escalate the dose or

intensity of cancer therapy without aggravating toxicity
in healthy tissue. Even if an increase in survival cannot be
achieved in this manner, cyclotherapy could still prove to
be an invaluable strategy to improve the quality of life of
cancer patients. That is, together with other advances in
chemo- and radio-therapy, cyclotherapy has the potential
to open a therapeutic window for cancer treatment.
