Abstract
Ovarian cancer carries a significant mortality. Since symptoms tend to be
minimal, the disease is often diagnosed when peritoneal metastases are already
present. The standard of care in advanced ovarian cancer consists of platinum-based
chemotherapy combined with cytoreductive surgery. Unfortunately, even after optimal
cytoreduction and adjuvant chemotherapy, most patients with stage III disease will
develop a recurrence. Intraperitoneal administration of chemotherapy is an alternative
treatment for patients with localized disease. The pharmacological and physiochemical
properties of melflufen, a peptidase potentiated alkylator, raised the hypothesis
that this drug could be useful in ovarian cancer and particularily against peritoneal
carcinomatosis. In this study the preclinical effects of melflufen were investigated in
different ovarian cancer models. Melflufen was active against ovarian cancer cell lines,
primary cultures of patient-derived ovarian cancer cells, and inhibited the growth
of subcutaneous A2780 ovarian cancer xenografts alone and when combined with
gemcitabine or liposomal doxorubicin when administered intravenously. In addition,
an intra- and subperitoneal xenograft model showed activity of intraperitoneal
administered melflufen for peritoneal carcinomatosis, with minimal side effects and
modest systemic exposure. In conclusion, results from this study support further
investigations of melflufen for the treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis from
ovarian cancer, both for intravenous and intraperitoneal administration.

diagnosed at an advanced stage, due to a lack of clinical
symptoms and effective screening methods [3]. Currently,
optimal debulking surgery combined with intravenous (IV)
carboplatin/cisplatin and paclitaxel-based chemotherapy
is the standard of care for primary OC, but historically

Ovarian cancer (OC) has the highest mortality rate of

as locoregional treatment with melflufen in preclinical
models of OC.

melphalan has been an important therapeutic option [4, 5].
Approximately 70–80% of patients with OC will relapse
after first-line chemotherapy, and the majority of them will
eventually die of their chemotherapy-resistant disease [6].
Therefore, new and more efficacious drugs for treatment
of ovarian canacer are needed. However, as this disease
rarely spreads systemically and remains mostly confined
to the peritoneal cavity, and given that intravenous (IV)
chemotherapy usually does not effectively penetrate into
peritoneal tumors, locoregional administration has been
investigated [7, 8]. Administration of intraperitoneal
chemotherapy (IPEC), whether or not under hyperthermic
conditions ((H)IPEC), might offer a benefit for peritoneal
metastases as compared to IV chemotherapy, since it
allows to achieve higher drug concentrations in the
peritoneal ﬂuid but less systemic toxicity [5, 8, 9].
Melflufen (melphalan flufenamide, chemically
described as melphalanyl-p-L–fluorophenylalanine ethyl
ester) is an optimized lipophilic and targeted derivative
of melphalan, an alkylating agent used for the treatment
of different cancers for over fifty years. The hydrolytic
cleavage of melflufen into melphalan in the cancer
cell is mediated by the action of aminopeptidases, like
aminopeptidase N (APN) [10–12]. APN or CD13, is a
transmembrane ectopeptidase which is overexpressed
in several hematopoietic and solid malignancies
including ovary-, breast-, lung-, and thyroid cancers [13].
Additionally, APN has been described as marker of a
malignant phenotype and to regulate tumor cell invasion,
differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis, as well as
angiogenesis [14–16]. Interestingly, tumor samples from
OC patients showed ubiquitous expression of APN in
tumor associated blood vessels that were common in
serous or mucinous subtypes, but less often in clear cell
epithelial subtype [17, 18]. Moreover, inhibition of APN
was reported to suppress proliferative- and migratory
abilities of OC cells [19]. A study by Surowiak et al.
suggested that APN is expressed to a higher extent in
tumor samples taken during primary surgery as compared
to samples from interval debulking after neoadjuvant
chemotherapy, indicating a decrease in APN expression
after initial chemotherapy treatment [18].
Preclinical in vitro and in vivo models showed that
melflufen exhibits significant antitumor activity in various
cancers, superior to melphalan, as well as anti-angiogenic
activity [13, 20–23]. Furthermore, melphalan has also
been reported to be an efficacious alternative agent for
patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and
(H)IPEC, for aggressive and recurrent peritoneal surface
malignancies [24, 25]. Since it is hypothesized that the
lipophilicity of melflufen is balanced by its susceptibility
to enzymatic hydrolysis, it is hypothesized that these
properties make melflufen an ideal intraperitoneal (IP)
agent for chemotherapy in OC patients. With this study,

RESULTS
Cytotoxic activity in OC cell lines and primary
human tumor cells
Melflufen was active against OC cell lines A2780,
A2780cis, ES-2, SK-OV-3 and SK-OV-3-Luc IP1 in vitro.
The cytotoxic inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50)
values were in the micromolar range (0.26–3.1 µM), and
with a 5-32-fold superiority over melphalan (Table 1).
Incubation of A2780 cells in hypoxic (1% O2) or anoxic
(0.1% O2) environment reduced the activity of melflufen
modestly, the IC50-value increased 1.2- and 2.0-fold
respectively (not shown). For melphalan this effect was
slightly more pronounced (2.0 and 2.6-fold, respectively)
[26]. Melflufen in combination with carboplatin,
doxorubicin, etoposide, gemcitabine, paclitaxel or the
Poly-ADP (Adenosine Diphosphate)-Ribose Polymerase
(PARP) III inhibitor DPQ, showed mainly additive effects,
but also many antagonistic effects and some examples
of synergistic events e.g. melflufen in combination with
gemcitabine in a cisplatin resistant ovarian carcinoma
cell line (A2780cis), and in combination with DPQ in
ES-2. Doxorubicin combinations were usually additive.
All tested combinations of melflufen and paclitaxel were
antagonistic. A selection of melflufen combinations with
gemcitabine, doxorubicin, DPQ and paclitaxel in A2780cis,
A2780, SKOV-3 and ES-2 are shown in Figure 1.
In primary cultures of patient-derived OC cells,
the mean IC50–value for melflufen was 0.33 µM (95% CI
of 0.27-0.39 µM) and for melphalan 16 µM (95% CI of
12–20 µM), i.e. a 49-fold potency difference (Figure 2).
No significant results were obtained for the analysis
of stratification factors in the patient material (ascitic
effusion, histological classification, prior chemotherapy,
response to subsequent chemotherapy, patient survival
after sampling, or stage of disease at sampling).
Interestingly, samples obtained from patients treated with
Pt containing chemotherapy in their most recent therapy
responded as well to melflufen as samples from previously
untreated patients (IC50–value post platinum = 0.24 and
de novo = 0.27 µM). The cytotoxic activity (expressed
as logIC50) of melflufen vs melphalan was significantly
positively correlated (R2 = 0.42, p < 0.0001), as expected
for two alkylating agents. Furthermore, the activity
correlated fairly well for melflufen and other DNAinteracting agents, i.e. vs cisplatin (R2 = 0.31, p < 0.0001),
poorly but significantly vs doxorubicin (R2 = 0.17,
p = 0.0006), but not vs docetaxel (R2 = 0.015, p = 0.42) or
gemcitabine (R2 = 0.016, p = 0.58) (Figure 3).

Melflufen IV shows in vivo activity in ovarian
xenograft alone and combined with gemcitabine
or liposomal doxorubicin

xenografts (Figure 4B). The combination offered better
tumor control than either drug alone with almost no net
tumor growth over the treatment period. The anti-tumor
effect was significant (p = 0.0204), and multiparametric
testing showed a significant difference between no
treatment and the melflufen- liposomal doxorubicin
combination. The effect of adding a sub-active dose of
gemcitabine (i.e. 5 mg/kg, determined in a preparatory
experiment) to melflufen 2, 4 or 8 mg/kg was also
evaluated in A2780 xenografts (Figure 4C). Increased
inhibition of growth of A2780 ovarian xenografts was
evident after all melflufen doses with the highest dose

Comparing A2780 subcutaneous (SC) xenograft
growth in untreated mice with those treated with single
agent melflufen or melphalan (Figure 4A) showed that
melflufen 8 mg/kg was significantly superior to the no
treatment as well as to melphalan treatment with 4 mg/kg
and 8 mg/kg (p = 0.0026). The effect of the combination of
melflufen (4 mg/kg) with liposomal doxorubicin (2 mg/kg)
was evaluated in the same A2780 ovarian carcinoma

In the subperitoneal (SP) xenograft model
(Figure 7), weight loss of the cisplatin treated animals was
significantly higher compared to the melflufen-treated
group (p = 0.0183). Significant antitumor activity was
observed in both treated groups, with a lower sPCI score
as compared to the untreated group (both treated groups =
0.0022 vs control). Additionally, significant differences
were demonstrated between the cisplatin-treated and
untreated groups regarding tumor volume (p = 0.0376)
and between the melflufen-treated and untreated group
in terms of tumor weight (p = 0.0059). No significant
differences were found regarding ascites score (p > 0.999)
and BLI signal between the melflufen or cisplatin-treated
and untreated mice, respectively (p = 0.372 and p = 0.175).
Beside from the decreased weight loss there were no
statistically significant differences between melflufen and
the positive control cisplatin.

approaching statistical significance (p = 0.0766). In a
pilot experiment, the in vivo effect of melflufen was
also evaluated in cisplatinum resistant A2780cis cells
subcutaneously xenografted to female SCID mice. As
expected, based on the observed in vitro cross resistance,
neither melflufen (8 mg/kg) nor gemcitabine (5 mg/kg)
had any significant effect on tumor growth. However, the
combination of these two treatments resulted in delayed
tumor growth and approximately doubled the time before
reaching the endpoint, although with significant toxicity in
the animals (not shown).

In vivo activity of melflufen in IP and SP OC
xenografts
In the IP xenograft model (Figure 5), the volume of
ascites present at sacrification was significantly lower in
the cisplatin-treated versus untreated mice (p = 0.0190).
Moreover, the simplified peritoneal carciomatosis
index (sPCI) score (measured as the number of regions
affected by tumor deposits) was significantly lower in the
melflufen-treated versus untreated mice (p = 0.0476). A
non-significant trend towards a lower bioluminiscence
imaging (BLI) signal was observed for both treated groups
(melflufen and cisplatin, p = 0.688 and p = 0.143). No
significant treatment related weight change was observed
(p = 0.759 and p = 0.813, melflufen and cisplatin vs
untreated mice, respectively), however, there was a nonsignificant trend for higher weight loss in the cisplatin
treated animals. Also, 88% of the IP engrafted mice
showed omental metastases.
Mice treated with melflufen and cisplatin showed a
similar, median survival of 44 and 46 days, respectively,
almost doubling the median survival of 23 days for
untreated mice (Figure 6). By conducting the log-rank
test for trend, the increased survival was found significant
for the treated animals (p = 0.0444 for melflufen). Two
mice were censored (one from the melflufen and one
from the cisplatin group), due to the injection of the drug
in the colon instead of IP, which leads to bacteria in the
abdominal cavity and consequently to sepsis.

Rapid uptake of melflufen in the IP cavity
Parmacokinetic analysis of melflufen and its
metabolites in IP fluid or plasma in non-tumor bearing
mice indicated that the peritoneal uptake of melflufen
was extensive and rapid, as no remaining melflufen
could be detected in IP fluid already at 5 minutes after
administration (Table 2). Melflufen was added in a
concentration of 73.3 µg/ml (corresponding to 136 µM)
into the IP cavity. The metabolites, des-ethylmelflufen
(de-esterification), and melphalan (peptide cleavage)
were detected in the IP fluid at 5, 15 and 30 minutes at
low concentrations (–8.8/9.7; 9.2/9.0; and 10/7.5 µM,
respectively), corresponding to about 15% of the added
dose. In plasma, only a small amount of melphalan could
be detected (2.2 µM) at 30 minutes, and a very low
concentration of des-ethylmelflufen (86 nM), which is
consistent with the high esterase activity in rodent blood.

DISCUSSION
Ovarian cancer (OC) carries a significant mortality,
mainly related to a late disease stage at diagnosis [1–3].

the in vivo antitumor efficacy of melflufen after IV or

The historical value of single agent melphalan in the
treatment of OC is indisputable [4]. Melflufen, a lipophilic
and targeted derivative of melphalan, is potentiated by
the action of aminopeptidases such as APN, which is
overexpressed or exhibits altered enzymatic activity in
OC [11, 13, 27]. Melflufen showed a superior antitumor

Despite initial sensitivity to several lines of chemotherapy,
in which platinum-taxane combinations play an important
role, approximately two-thirds of patients eventually die
from their disease. This illustrates the need for novel
agents [6].
In this study, we demonstrate the in vitro
cytotoxicity of melflufen against different OC cell lines
and patient-derived OC cells, and show for the first time

activity compared to melphalan in various in vitro and
in vivo models of human cancer, including anti-angiogenic
activity [13, 20–23]. The use of IP chemotherapy permits
the administration of higher drug doses, while minimizing
systemic toxicity [5, 8, 28–30]. Several large randomized
trials have demonstrated that the addition of catheterbased IP chemotherapy to adjuvant IV treatment results
in a significantly better survival compared to IV treatment
alone [31–33]. The above considerations prompted us to
investigate the preclinical effects of melflufen in different
OC xenograft models, with cisplatin as a positive control
treatment, since the platinum compounds are considered
the standard drug for IP and IV treatment of OC [30, 34].
Results of our in vitro experiments confirm the
superior antitumor activity of melflufen compared to
melphalan, showing a 5 to 32-fold higher activity for OC
cell lines and a 43-fold higher activity for primary cultures
of patient-derived OC cells. In addition, the antitumor
effect of melflufen was also demonstrated in vivo in
different xenograft models with A2780 cells xenografted
SC and SK-OV-3 Luc IP1 cells xenografted IP and SP.
Primary human tumor cells (PHTC) have received
relatively little attention as a preclinical cancer stem
cell like model [35]. In fact, in vitro response analysis
of PHTC reports accurate diagnosis specific activity of
cancer drugs and predict clinical response for individual
patients [36, 37]. Furthermore, the in vivo selection of
cells able to establish tumors in the used SK-OV-3 Luc
IP model selects cells with ovarian cancer stem cell-like
properties.
Systemically administered melflufen showed single
agent activity in a subcutaneous A2780 xenografts model.

Furthermore, additional in vitro and xenograft studies
revealed an improved anti-tumor activity and tumor
control, respectively, when melflufen was combined
with either gemcitabine or liposomal doxorubicin, two
agents used commonly used in OC [38, 39]. Previously,
our group found synergistic activity of melflufen and the
DNA-topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide against several
cell lines [40]. In addition, IP administered melflufen
showed also antitumor efficacy in intraperitoneal (IP) and
subperitoneal (SP) SK-OV-3 Luc IP1 xenografts, based on
the sPCI scores. The IP model was set up to mimic diffuse
ovarian cancer, while the SP model was chosen to induce
isolated tumor nodules that we could follow in time. In
general, mice tolerated melflufen treatment very well, and
only modest weight changes were observed, as previously
reported by Gullbo et al. [22]. In contrast, cisplatin
treated and untreated mice lost weight, probably due to
dehydration and cancer cachexia, respectively [41, 42].
Remarkably, 88% of the IP xenograft mice showed
omental metastases, which might be explained by the
important role of omental milky spots and splenoportal fat
[43]. Furthermore, a trend towards a lower BLI for both
xenograft models was found. However, BLI data could not
be easily interpreted due to distinct variability in relatively
small groups and to camouflage of the total flux signal by
the largest implant.
A median survival of 44 and 46 days was found for
melflufen and cisplatin, respectively, compared to a median
of 23 days in the control group. Finally, pharmacokinetic
analysis after IP administration of melflufen indicated
a rapid and complete uptake from the abdominal cavity
with undetectable concentrations already after 5 minutes.

tumor-related causes and were indicated with a square (n = 5 to 6 animals in each group).

Concentrations of 2.2 µM melphalan were detected in
mouse plasma after 30 minutes, a time point suggested
to be relatively close to the Cmax. Interestingly, this is
considerably lower than the melphalan Cmax of 50.3 µM
after IP administration of the LD10 dose (71.3 mg/m²) [44].
This results suggest that the use of IP melflufen is safe
and unlikely to yield mortality or significant hematologic
toxicity. In contrast, systemically administered melflufen,
given to patients with advanced or progressive ovarian
carcinoma and non-small-cell lung cancer, caused
reversible neutropeunia and thromocytopenia [27]. PabaPrada et al. found the same dose-limiting toxicities in

relapsed - refractory multiple myeloma patients treated
with melflufen and dexamethasone [45].
In conclusion, we show a significant activity of
melflufen in vitro against OC cell lines and primary
cultures of patient-derived OC cells. Melflufen activity is
superior compared to that of the parental drug melphalan in
subcutaneous as well as intra- or subperitoneal OC xenografts.
In addition, synergism was achieved with
gemcitabine and liposomal doxorubucin, possibly
indicating a potential for combination therapy of these in
clinical trials for patients where conventional therapies
have failed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

subcutaneously applied to hydrate all animals during
treatment. Mice were IP injected with 0.2 ml (15 mg/ml)
of D-luciferin (PerkinElmer, Zaventem, Belgium) 10
minutes prior to BLI, which was analyzed with the Living
Image® 4.3.1 software (IVIS® Lumina II, PerkinElmer).

Ethics statement
Patient sampling for the primary cultures of human
tumor cells (PHTC) was approved by the regional ethical
committee (Dnr 237/2007).
All animal experiments were approved by the
Animal Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine
at Ghent University (ECD 14/66) or by the Animal
Ethical committee in Stockholm Sweden (N 284/08 to
Dr Spira), and were performed according to Belgian,
Swedish and European legislature on animal welfare.
Mice were examined daily for pain or discomfort and
“The Guidelines for the welfare and use of animals in
cancer research” were strictly followed for distention of
the abdomen, physical condition and other clinical signs
of mice, which show necessary intervention, as prescribed
by The National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI)” [46].
Food and water was given ad libitum. All procedures were
performed under general anesthesia (Forene®, AbbVie,
Waver, Belgium) and analgesia (Ketoprofen, 5 mg/kg).

Cell lines
The human OC cell lines, A2780 and A2780cis were
obtained from Sigma Aldrich. The latter made resistant to
cisplatin as previously described [48]. The ES-2 (CRL1978) and SK-OV-3 (HTB-77) cells were both purchased
from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Wesel,
Germany). The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (A2780
and A2780cis) or McCoys 5A medium (ES-2 and SKOV-3) and complemented with 10% FCS and 2% pest/
glut (all Sigma Aldrich). The human OC cell line SK-OV3-Luc IP1 is a more potent, luciferase positive OC cell
line, created through in vivo selection [49]. Sort Tandem
Repeat (SRT) profiling was conducted as described
by De Vlieghere et al. [49]. This cell line was cultured
in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM,
Life technologies, ThermoFisher, Ghent, Belgium),
supplemented with 2% penicillin/streptomycin (Life
technologies) + 0.005% fungizone (Bristol-Myers-Squib
B.V., Utrecht, The Netherlands) and 10% FCS (SigmaAldrich) [50]. Saline and BD matrigel (Life Sciences,
Antwerp, Belgium) were used to dilute SK-OV-3-Luc
IP1 cells before IP and SP injection, respectively. The
cell banks performed authentications by short tandem
repeat analysis. All cell line experiments in Sweden were
performed within 6 month after resuscitation, in Belgium
STR was done to verify identity.

Reagents
The dipeptide melflufen, a kind gift from OncoPeptides
AB, was dissolved in either dimethyl acetamide (DMA),
dimetylsulfoxid (DMSO) or ethanol (EtOH) (Sigma-Aldrich,
Diegem, Belgium or Stockholm, Sweden), stocked at –20°C
and protected from light. Cisplatin Hospira was provided by
Hospira Benelux BVBA (Antwerp, Belgium). Melphalan
(Alkeran, GlaxoSmithKline, Mölndal, Sweden), gemcitabine
(Gemzar, Lilly AB, Solna, Sweden), doxorubicin (SigmaAldrich) and liposomal doxorubicin (Caelyx, ScheringPlough, New Jersey, USA) were obtained from the Stateowned Pharmacy Chain (Apoteket AB, Uppsala, Sweden),
and the PARP III inhibitor, DPQ, was obtained from Merck
Millipore (Solna, Sweden). All chemicals which were not
obtained as infusion solutions were dissolved in EtOH or
DMSO and diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or
saline.
For the subcutaneous xenograft studies, melflufen
or melphalan were dissolved in DMA and further
diluted in 5% glucose infusion fluid into indicated final
concentrations less than 15 minutes prior to injection.
Liposomal doxorubicin and gemcitabine were also diluted
in 5% glucose infusion fluid as described in Gallo et al.
[47] to appropriate concentrations.
For the IP experiments, cisplatin and melflufen
(dissolved in DMSO/EtOH) were diluted in saline less
than 15 minutes prior to injection. Isofluran (Forene®),
sevofluran (Sevorane®, AbbVie) and 1 mg/ml ketoprofen
(Rofenid®, Sanofi Aventis, Diegem, Belgium) were used
for anesthesia and analgesia of the animals. Glucose 5%
(0.2 ml; B Braun Medical N.V., Diegem, Belgium) and
Hartmann’s solution (0.4 ml; B Braun Medical N.V.) were

Analyses of drug combinations
Additive combination effect analysis was performed
at concentrations of melflufen and standard drugs,
producing a viability of 60–80% in single drug analysis.
Firstly, single drug activity was determined in the cell
lines to select suitable combination concentrations. A
fixed concentration of melflufen (0.32, 0.16, or 0.08 µM
for A2780 and ES-2 and or 4, 2, or 1 µM for A2780cis and
SK-OV-3) and a seven step dilutions concentration range
for the standard drug was added to the cells and analyzed
by the FMCA. The effect of the combination was defined
as synergistic if the observed viability was lesser than the
sum of both drugs administered alone, i.e. the expected
additive effect, and antagonistic if it was greater than the
sum of both drugs administered alone.

Primary cultures of human tumor cells (PHTC)
from patients
Ovarian cancer patient samples were obtained
from 82 patients by either surgery or as needle biopsies,

In addition, prior to the IP in vivo experiments the
traditional in vitro MTT ([3-4,5-Dimethylthiazolyl-2]2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide; (Sigma-Aldrich))
cell viability assay was carried out, to determine and to
compare the sensitivity (IC50) of the SK-OV-3 LUC IP1
cells to cisplatin. Briefly, SK-OV-3 Luc IP1 cells were
seeded as monolayers in 96-well plates at a density
of 4.0 × 104 cells/ml. Subsequently, after 24 hours
of incubation (37°C, 10% CO2), cells were exposed
for 2 hours with cisplatin or melflufen at indicated
concentrations (0.1-100 µM and 0.01-7 µM, respectively).
After 72 hours of incubation, 20 µl MTT (5 mg/ml) was
administered to each well for 2 hours. Subsequently, MTT
solutions were removed and 100 µl of DMSO was added
to each well to measure the absorbance of metabolically
active cells. These measurements were performed at 570
nm in a Paradigm Detection platform and analysed with the Soft
Max Pro 6.1 software (BIO-RAD laboratories, Hemel
Hempstead, United Kingdom). Three independent MTT
assays, with three replicates were performed.

and delivered to the laboratory within 24 hours. The cell
preparation protocol described by Blom et al. was used
[51]. Briefly, the samples were minced and dispersed in
collagenase (Collagenase type I, 1.5 mg/ml; Sigma and
DNase Type I, 100 µg/ml; Sigma in CO2-Independent
Medium; Gibco, pH 7.35 to 7.45) in 37°C for 1-4
hours and purified by density gradient centrifugation
(histopaque®-1077; Sigma Aldrich). Viability was
determined by staining the cells with trypan or toluidine
blue and counting in a Bürker chamber. A cytopathologist
estimated the proportion of tumor cells by inspection of
May–Grunwald–Giemsa-stained cytospin preparations.
The cells were diluted in RPMI 1640 (complemented with
10% FCS and 2% pest/glut) prior to seeding in culture
plates for drug sensitivity testing.
For analysis of different groups, the patient material
was stratified for the factors ascitic effusion (yes/no),
histological classification (high grade serous/low grade
serous/others), prior chemotherapy (yes/no), response to
subsequent chemotherapy (complete response vs. partial
response/stable disease vs. progressive disease), patient
survival after sampling (none vs. less than 2 year) and
stage of disease at sampling (I–IIIC vs IV).

In vivo studies
Subcutaneous xenografts

Viability assays (FMCA and MTT)

For the subcutaneous (SC) xenografts studies,
A2780 cells were engrafted into immunocompromized
mice. Female SCID mice with a BALB c background
(MTC Animal Facility, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm,
Sweden) aged of 8-10 weeks were used. To establish the
xenografts, 1.0×106 A2780 cells were suspended in PBS
and injected in a total volume of 0.2 ml subcutaneously
in the right flank of each mouse. The animals were either
left untreated or treated with melflufen, melphalan,
liposomal doxorubicin or gemcitabine as indicated below.
Tumor growth was measured by caliper at indicated time
points. Tumor size was calculated by the formula: Tumor
size = [length × width²]/ 2 as described by Gallo et al.
[47]. Detailed treatment schedule of the subcutaneous
xenografts is given in Table 3.

The Fluorometric cytotoxicity assay (FMCA) was
used to assess the viability of OC cell lines and patient
human tumor cells (PHTCs) as previous described
elsewhere [52, 53]. Briefly, the drugs and the cells were
seeded (5000 cells/well for both cell lines and PHTCs)
into a 384-well microtiter plate (Nunc) using an Echo 550
liquid handler (Labcyte), and a pipetting robot Biomek
2000 (Beckman Coulter), respectively. The plates were
incubated for 72 hours in a 37°C humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2 and were then washed with PBS once,
and 10 µg/ml FDA (50 µl) was added. After 60 minutes
of incubation, fluorescence was measured (485/538 nm
exitation/emission) in a Fluostar Omega fluorometer
(Biotech). The fluorescence signal is directly proportional
to the number of viable cells. Cell survival is presented as
Survival Index% (SI%), defined as mean signal of each
drug concentration divided by mean signal of the untreated
cells (with blank signal subtracted). A concentration curve
was made using Graph Pad Prism, and an IC50-value was
calculated for each drug. Quality criteria for a successful
assay included > 75% starting cell viability (by trypan or
toluidine blue exclusion), a signal in untreated cells that
were more than ten times the blank, and a coefficient
of variation in untreated and blank wells of < 30%.
Additionally, the effect of melflufen and melphalan was
assessed in the A2780 cell line, cultivated in oxygen
deprived environment (i.e. anoxia: 0.1% O2 or hypoxia:
1.0% O2) employing a Ruskinn InVivo2 500 hypoxic
incubator (Ruskinn Technology Ltd, Pencoed, UK) as
previously described by Strese et al. [26].

Intraperitoneal and subperitoneal xenografts
Athymic, nude-foxn1nu female mice (ENVIGO,
NM Horst, the Netherlands) of 6 weeks age and an
avarage weight of 20 g were conditioned one week before
the start of each study. Two OC xenograft mice models
with SK-OV-3 Luc IP1 cells were employed to study the
antitumor efficacy of IP administered melflufen compared
with treatment using saline and cisplatin, respectively.
Engraftment was made with tumor cells injected IP
(2.0 × 106 SK-OV-3 Luc IP1 cells, dissolved in 0.5 ml of
saline) or bilateral in the SP space (between the muscle
and the mesothelial layer of the peritoneal wall, 5.0 × 105
of SK-OV-3 Luc IP1 cells dissolved in 50 µl BD matrigel
(Life Sciences) [50, 54]. Mice (5-6/group) were treated

IP, 1 or 3 weeks after the injection of SK-OV-3 Luc
IP1 cells in the IP and SP model, with either melflufen
or cisplatin and monitored for another two weeks after
treatment (Table 4). Untreated animals were injected
with only saline. After each treatment mice were imaged
using BLI and this signal was reported as relative values
compared to the BLI signal at day 0. Furthermore, the
physical condition of mice was followed-up during and
after treatment. After 2 weeks of follow-up, mice were
sacrificed and tumor nodules were harvested, weighted
and measured. Additionally, tumor volumes (mm3) were
estimated according to the formula mentioned above
[47]. The sPCI score was based on the number of affected
regions, because individual tumor nodules were too small
and too numerous. However, this method is clinically used
and described elsewhere [55, 56]. In addition, the used
sPCI score was in agreement with Van Der Vange et al.
[57].
Animals were euthanized when a body weight loss
of 20% at any timepoint or 15% maintained for 72 h
was observed compared with the pre-treatment weight
or with the age-matched controls. In addition, a human
endpoint was set on a BLI signal of 1.0 × 1011 photons/
second, considered to indicate maximal tumor growth. .
When sacrificed, autopsies were done for all mice and the
number of affected sPCI areas were determined [57].
In addition, a survival experiment was setup separately from the IP and SP tumor xenografts

experiments. Therefore, the same IP model was used
including treatment, imaging, and endpoints.

Pharmacokinetic study
A pharmacokinetic study was performed in 6 nontumor bearing animals treated once a week for 2 weeks
(1QW × 2W) with either melflufen (n = 3) or with saline
(n = 3). Intraperitoneal fluid samples were drawn at 5,
15, and 30 min each time after IP injection, while blood
samples were only drawn once after 30 min. using cardiac
puncture followed by euthanasia. After the IP addition of
melflufen (73 µg/mL), the concentrations of melflufen, deethyl melflufen and melphalan in plasma and IP fluid were
analyzed using HPLC-MS/MS at OnTarget Cemistry AB,
Uppsala, Sweden. Quantification was performed using
deuterium labeled internal standards (IS), D8-melflufen
and D8-melphalan.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with Graphpad
Prism™ 6 (Graphpad software, Inc.; La Jolla, Ca, USA).
FMCA and MTT IC50-values were calculated using nonlinear regression analysis (dose-respons inhibition).
Single comparisons of appropriate groups were done
with Student’s t-test, multiple comparisons with one-way
ANOVA and Turkey’s multiple comparison post -test. Data

from the in vivo IP and SP models were analyzed using
non-parametric tests (Kruskall-Wallis and Dunn’s multiple
comparisons test) and the Mann-Whitney test. Survival
analysis was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method,
and survival differences between goups were evaluated
using the log-rank test for trend. A p-value < 0.05 was
considered to indicate statistical significance.
