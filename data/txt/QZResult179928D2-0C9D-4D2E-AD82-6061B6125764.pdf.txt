Abstract:

Squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (SCCHN) is the sixth leading cause for
cancer deaths worldwide. Despite extense knowledge of risk factors and pathogenesis
about 50 percent of all patients and essentially every patient with metastatic SCCHN
eventually die from this disease. We analyzed the clinical data and performed
immunohistochemistry for Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Aurora
kinase A (Aurora-A) expression in 180 SCCHN patients. Patients characterized by
elevated EGFR and elevated Aurora-A protein expression in tumor tissue represent
a risk group with poor disease-free and overall survival (EGFRlowAurora-Alow versus
EGFRhighAurora-Ahigh, p=0.024). Treating SCCHN cell lines with a pan-Aurora kinase
inhibitor resulted in defective cytokinesis, polyploidy and apoptosis, which was
effective irrespective of the EGFR status. Combined Aurora kinase and EGFR targeting
using a monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody was more effective compared to single EGFR
and Aurora kinase inhibition. Comparing pan-Aurora kinase and Aurora-A targeting
hints towards a strong and clinically relevant biological effect mediated via Aurora
kinase B (Aurora-B). Taken together, our findings characterize a new poor risk group
in SCCHN patients defined by elevated EGFR and Aurora-A protein expression. Our
results demonstrate that combined targeting of EGFR and Aurora kinases represents
a therapeutic means to activate cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis in SCCHN.

Introduction

gene and mutations in genes that encode cell cycle proteins
such as p16 and cyclin D1. In addition, several oncogenic
pathways including Ras, PI3K/PTEN/Akt, TGF-β/BMP
and EGFR/STAT3 are up-regulated in SCCHN [4-11].
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression
in SCCHN is often caused by gene amplification [12], and
elevated expression correlates with poor disease control
and metastasis [13-14]. Furthermore, overexpression of
two of its ligands, EGF and transforming growth factoralpha (TGF-alpha), has been linked to a poor prognosis
[15]. The major signaling pathways activated by EGFR
are the RAS-RAF-MAP kinase pathway, which is mainly
involved in proliferation, and the PI3K-PTEN-AKT
pathway, which is mainly involved in survival [16]. The

Squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (SCCHN)
is the sixth leading cause for cancer deaths worldwide [1].
Despite recent progress in understanding SCCHN biology
and improved treatment, the 5 year survival has remained
50 percent for the past two decades. There is a pressing
need to improve therapy in particular for patients with
metastatic disease or local recurrence, where the median
progression-free and overall survival is only ~ 6 months
and ~11 months, respectively [2-4].
Several genetic alterations have been described in
SCCHN, including mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor

addition of the monoclonal antibody C225 (cetuximab)
to the standard first-line regimen cisplatin/5-fluorouracil
[17] not only increased the rate of objective responses but
also improved progression-free and overall survival in
patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN [2].
The Aurora kinases A and B (Aurora-A and
Aurora-B) are highly conserved serine/threonine kinases
that play essential and distinct roles in mitosis [18].
Specifically, Aurora-A is required for the assembly of
the mitotic spindle, where it accumulates on centrosomes
at the spindle poles during prophase until metaphase.
Recently a kinase-independent role in mitotic spindle
assembly has been reported for Aurora-A [19]. Aurora-B
is required for mitotic progression and cytokinesis, and is
localized, along with inner centromeric protein (INCENP)
and survivin, at centromeres and the spindle midzone
during the metaphase to anaphase transition [18, 20].
AURORA-A (AURKA) mRNA is amplified in a variety of
human cancers including SCCHN, where it is associated
with poor prognosis [21]. Increased levels of Aurora-B
have been reported in various aggressive malignancies
[20].
Both Aurora-A and EGFR overexpression have
been implicated in SCCHN tumorigenesis and are
established adverse prognostic factors. Aurora-A and
EGFR share downstream signaling pathways, and each
by itself represents an attractive therapeutic target. Here
we report that joint protein overexpression of EGFR
and Aurora-A defines a poor risk group among SCCHN
patients. Combining drugs that target Aurora kinases and

Publicly available gene expression data [22]
(www.oncomine.org) were analyzed for the expression
and prognostic relevance of EGFR and AURORA-A
expression. AURORA-A transcripts were expressed at
significantly higher levels in SCCHN tumor samples as
compared to normal control tissue (p=0.002, Figure 1), and
the median relative expression in surviving patients was
lower as compared to patients dying from SCCHN (n.s.).
In a previous report the level of AURORA-A transcript was
associated with survival [21]. We therefore next addressed
the prognostic relevance of Aurora-A and EGFR protein
levels in the SCCHN patient cohort (n=180) described in
Table 1. There was a highly significant difference between
patients’ protein levels when comparing normal adjacent
mucosa with the levels expressed in tumor cells for both
Aurora-A and EGFR (Figure 2A), with independent
expression of EGFR and Aurora-A for each patient (r=0.03
/ p=0.74). Furthermore, there were clear differences in
expression levels for Aurora-A and EGFR within the
patient tumor tissue assessed (Figure 2). While protein
levels of EGFR (Figure 3A) or Aurora-A (Figure 3B)
above median assessed by IHC in a Kaplan Meier analysis
did not identify a population with a significantly reduced
disease-free survival (EGFR: p=0.10; Aurora-A; p=0.21),
our analysis identifies a poor risk population with regard
to overall and disease-free survival that is characterized
by above median levels of EGFR (EGFRhigh) and
Aurora-A (Aurora-Ahigh) (p=0.024, compared to EGFRlow
and Aurora-Alow, Figure 2C). Thus, the coexpression

Figure 5: Combined exposure to EGFR antibody and Aurora kinase inhibitor results in fortified growth inhibition
and apoptosis. (A) SCCHN cells were treated for a total of 14 days with cetuximab (200 nM), the Aurora kinase inhibitor R763, the
combination of both (Cet+ R763), or carrier only (control). The cell number was counted at the indicated times and the -fold increase in
cell number calculated. Note that the increase in cell number is given in a logarythmic scale. The combination of cetuximab and Aurora
kinase inhibitor resulted in a significantly reduced -fold increase after 14 day treatment period in all cell lines investigated in comparison
to all other conditions (Cet alone, R763 alone, control; p<0.05). (B) The indicated SCCHN cells were cultured for a 48 hr period with the
indicated conditions (cetuximab 200 nM, R7635 nM) and assessed for DNA content by PI staining. The percentage of polyploid cells with

4C, upper panel). We then assessed the abundance of S10HH3 as a measure of Aurora kinase activity. The exposure
to 5 nM R763 lead to a rapid and efficient decrease in S10HH3 levels (Figure 4C, lower panel). In order to assess the
Aurora kinase inhibition effects on ploidy and cell death
we next treated SCCHN cell lines for a 24 hour period
with R763 at various concentrations. There was a strong
effect with regard to G2-M arrest and/or ploidy (p<0.05
in all cell lines, Figure 4D) and to a lesser extent to the
subG1 fraction of SCCHN cells, indicating that mitosis
and cytokinesis were effectively blocked. R763 treatment

did however result in low apoptosis rates. In conclusion,
a low nanomolar concentration of the Aurora kinase
inhibitor R763 resulted in effective inhibition of Aurora
kinase activity, of cytokinesis and caused polyploidy.

targeting both is an attractive therapeutic approach. We
therefore assessed whether combined targeting using
R763 and cetuximab would result in increased cell cycle
effects and/or apoptosis. To mimic the in vivo drug action
we estimated the long term effects of EGFR and/or Aurora
kinase targeting in asynchronously growing SCCHN
cultures. SCCHN growth curves revealed that the addition
of 200 nM cetuximab or 5 nM R763 results in a delayed
growth inhibition starting at around 7 days after treatment
initiation (data not shown). The effects of a combination
treatment in longer term cell culture were significantly
pronounced (Figure 5A). Quite surprisingly, in cell lines
that showed no or very moderate growth inhibition upon
cetuximab only treatment (BHY and FaDu), addition
of the Aurora kinase inhibitor led to an additive growth
inhibition (Figure 4A), even in cells that are characterized
by very low EGFR expression (BHY, Figure 4A). Thus,
the combination of Aurora kinase inhibition and EGFR
targeting is highly efficient in vitro and may overcome
cetuximab resistance.
To mechanistically address the additive effect
SCCHN cells were incubated with 5 nM R763, which
blocked kinase activity effectively (Figure 4C), 200
nM cetuximab or the combination of both drugs, and
compared to untreated controls. 48 hour treatment
with cetuximab showed minor efficacy with regard to
cell cycle arrest and polyploidy or apoptosis induction
assessed by PI staining or AnnexinV positivity. 48 hour
treatment with R763 resulted in a significant increase in
polyploid (Figure 5A) and apoptotic cells (Figure 5B).
The combination of cetuximab and R763 did not lead to
a significantly increased fraction of cells with a polyploid
phenotype representing defective mitosis and cytokinesis
as compared to R763 monotherapy (Figure 5A), but,
importantly, in several cell lines to a significantly elevated
percentage of cell death (subG1 DNA content, data not
shown), and AnnexinV positive apoptotic cells (Figure
5B). Thus, combined EGFR and Aurora kinase targeting
results in additive effects, potentially by sensitizing
mitotic checkpoints.

(Figure 6C). A direct comparison of the Pan-Aurora
kinase inhibitor R763 (5nM) and the Aurora-A specific
kinase inhibitor Mln (10nM) at concentrations that each
block S10-HH3 phosphorylation effectively revealed that
the R763/cetuximab combination was much more potent
in inducing polyploidy (Figure 6D) as well as apoptosis
(Figure 6E) compared to cetuximab in combination with
the specific Aurora-A inhibitor Mln. Thus, the superior
effects of R763 are most likely mediated by its blockage
of Aurora-B activity or its dual Aurora kinase inhibition.

Discussion
Other than EGFR blockage through cetuximab,
none of the targeted approaches have yet shown clinically
convincing results or changed the standard of care in
relapsed or metastatic SCCHN. We identify the Aurora
kinases as potential targets in this disease. Aurora kinases
are upregulated in multiple human cancers, correlating
in some cases with poor prognosis [18, 20-21, 29]. By
investigating 180 patient samples of SCCHN tumors we
show that both Aurora-A and EGFR are significantly
overexpressed in tumor tissue. The spearman correlation
coefficient showed that the expression of Aurora-A and
EGFR was independent. Our findings thus establish that
the joint overexpression of EGFR and Aurora-A defines
a subgroup of SCCHN patients with inferior prognosis
regarding disease-free and overall survival. These results
prompt the analysis of combined targeted treatment
strategies in this disease. We used a dual Aurora-A/
Aurora-B inhibitor in combination with EGFR blockage
through cetuximab and established an additive or possibly
even synergistic effect on SCCHN cells in vitro. At
this time it is however not clear whether Aurora-B was
the main therapeutic target in our SCCHN studies or
whether combined inhibition of Aurora-A and Aurora-B
is beneficial. In a targeted small interfering RNA screen
others identified Aurora-A as a component of an EGFRcentered network. When the Aurora kinase inhibitor PHA680632 (PHA) was combined with EGFR inhibition,
therapeutic synergism was observed in EGFR-dependent
cell lines [30]. It has however to be noted that the applied
concentrations of PHA most likely also inhibit Aurora-B
[31]. There is further linkage between EGFR activation
and Aurora-A. A study demonstrated that the nuclear
EGFR can cooperate with STAT5A to target the promoter
region of AURORA-A and enhance its expression in
cancer cells [32].
A consistent finding in our in vitro study is that
there is a uniform additive inhibition of cell growth when
cetuximab and Aurora kinase inhibition was combined,
even in cell lines that were resistant towards EGFR-directed
treatment or that showed moderate growth inhibition upon
single Aurora kinase targeting. Our immunohistochemical
studies did not address the frequency of the EGFRvIII
mutant that might be associated with resistance towards

Selective Aurora-A inhibition is less effective than
combined Aurora kinase inhibition
R763 is a pan-Aurora kinase inhibitor that inhibits
Aurora-A and Aurora-B [28]. To further analyze whether
Aurora-A, a prognostic factor in SCCHN [21](and this
report Figure 3), or Aurora-B is the major target of R763
in SCCHN, we next directly compared R763 with the
Aurora-A specific kinase inhibitor MLN8237 (Mln).
Mln effectively blocked S10-HH3 phosphorylation at
10nM (Figure 6A). Mln treatment furthermore resulted
in an increase of the fraction of polyploid cells (Figure
6B), and combined EGFR and Aurora-A targeting using
Mln decreased the growth of SCCHN cells significantly

cetuximab [24]. The cell lines we used did not express
EGFRvIII. At this time we cannot conclude whether
EGFRvIII bearing SCCHN patients have an inferior
prognosis (our retrospective cohort) or whether EGFRvIII
mutant cell lines are different with regard to sensitivity
towards Aurora kinase inhibition. A recent clinical trial
indicated that high EGFRvIII expression levels identify
SCCHN patients who are less likely to benefit from
combination treatment with cetuximab and docetaxel
[33]. However, our studies suggest that even inhibiting a
very low level of EGFR expression might be sufficient
to sensitize for Aurora kinase inhibition. This could occur
by either concertedly targeting the same growth and/or
survival pathways or by blocking resistance-mediating
mechanisms.
The G2-M targeting approach is of particular
interest since conventional chemotherapy usually targets
cancer cells at the G1-S transition of the cell cycle. The
cell cycle is driven by Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk).
Of particular importance is the negative regulation of
Cdk by checkpoints when defects such as DNA damage
occur. Following DNA damage the transcription factor
p53 is activated, which results in transcription of the Cdk
inhibitor p21 and cell cycle arrest in G1, or induction of
apoptosis [34]. Loss of p53 function, a frequent event in
SCCHN [4, 35], therefore has the dual effect of loss of the
G1-S checkpoint and loss of an important pathway leading
to death [36]. On the other hand G2-M checkpoint genes
are rarely if ever mutated in cancer. Therefore therapeutics
targeting cancer cells at G2-M and during cytokinesis
are highly interesting. Current therapeutic strategies
in SCCHN use mitotic poisons such as taxanes, which
act directly on spindle microtubules inducing spindle
assembly checkpoint (SAC) activation, and prolonged
mitotic arrest that frequently ends in cell death [37]. A
second approach is to directly target mitotic checkpoint
kinases such as Aurora kinases. Several of the currently
available Aurora kinase inhibitors target both Aurora-A
and Aurora-B. Comparing the pan Aurora kinase inhibitor
R763 [25] with the Aurora-A specific inhibitor MLN our
results establish Aurora-B as the potentially more powerful
target in SCCHN, but cannot rule out that a combined
Aurora-A and Aurora-B inhibition might be beneficial to
induce mitotic failure and cell death. Importantly, there are
interactions between Aurora-A and p53, where Aurora-A
directly phosphorylates p53 to augment p53 protein
turnover and transcriptional activity [38]. In addition, a
differential effect of Aurora kinase inhibition related to
function p53 has been suggested [39].
The G2-M checkpoint is a particularly interesting
therapeutic target in SCCHN, where due to the high
frequency of mutations in the p53 apoptotic pathway the
G1-S checkpoint is often dysfunctional. Our results define
a new risk group in SCCHN and provide a rationale for
testing combined EGFR and Aurora kinase targeting in
clinical studies.

Patient selection and tissue samples
Paraffin wax-embedded tumor samples from 180
patients (mean age 54 years, range 30-70 years) with a
squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx,
hypopharynx and larynx were investigated. Patients had
been treated by radical surgical resection between 1993
and 1997 in the Department of Head and Neck Surgery,
Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universität München
(TUM), Munich, Germany or in the Department of Head
and Neck Surgery, University of Regensburg, Regensburg,
Germany.
The pT and pN categories of the tumor were
determined according to the tumor-node-metastasis
classification [40] and tumor grading according to
the World Health Organization (WHO) classification
[41]. For all tumors and patients, histopathological and
clinical follow-up data were available (mean follow-up
period 6.6 years, follow-up period of 0.02 to 13.6 years).
Clinical and histopathological data were correlated with
expression patterns of Aurora-A and EGFR. The study
was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical
Faculty of the TUM. Detailed patient characteristics and
histomorphological features are shown in Table 1.

Preparation of Tissue MicroArrays (TMA),
Immunohistochemistry (IHC), and Scoring
For each of the 180 SCCHN, one paraffin block was
selected. An experienced pathologist marked the viable,
representative areas of tumor specimens. Core needle
biopsy specimens were retrieved from the original tumor
blocks by using a manual arrayer (Beecher Instruments,
Sun Prairie, WI, USA) and positioned in a recipient
paraffin wax array block. We aimed to obtain at least three
tissue cylinders per tumor with a diameter of 0.6 mm from
each biopsy specimen.
IHC was performed on deparaffinized tissue sections
(2µm), stained with antibodies against Aurora kinase A
(Novocastra, Leica-Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany)
and EGFR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA), visualized with peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibody (LSAB Kit, DAKO, Hamburg, Germany).
The tissue sections were counterstained with Mayer
hematoxylin solution. For positive controls, we used
tissues with known expression of the respective antigens.
For negative controls, we used irrelevant antibodies with
the same immunoglobulin isotype.
According to previously published criteria
cytoplasmatic and/or nuclear immunoreactivity of
Aurora-A [21] and the membrane and/or cytoplasmatic
staining of EGFR [42] was evaluated in three tumor areas of

each case. Immunoreactivity was scored into seven groups
according to the percentage and intensity of cytoplasmic,
nuclear and membrane staining of the positively stained
tumor cells. Specimens with > 60% of cells stained were
scored as strongly positive (4+), those with 30-60% of
cells stained were scored as moderately positive (3+),
those with 10-20% of cells stained were scored as weakly
positive (2+), those with < 10% cells stained were scored
as less weakly positive (1+). Specimens with no staining
were scored as negative. The intensity of staining was
grouped in strong (3+), moderate (2+) and weak (1+).
Intensity and percentage of staining cells were added up
identifying the seven groups. All scoring analysis was
done by two independent investigators. To compare high
with low expression levels, a median split analysis was
applied. EGFR≥5 and Aurora-A≥5 were specified as high
expression.

RNA preparation and analyses
For reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (qRTPCR), RNA was prepared from cultured cells using the
RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). cDNA was
prepared from 2µg RNA using the SuperScript II reverse
transcriptase cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen, Darmstadt,
Germany). qRT-PCR was performed on an ABI Prism
7900 cycler (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany)
with the Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMIXUDG kit (Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany). Data were
analyzed by using the ∆Ct method, where Ubiquitin
served as an internal control, with one sample set as 1.
RT-PCR was performed to validate the expression of the
EGFRvIII mutant in NIH-3T3 cells. Primer sequences can
be obtained from the authors upon request.

Cell culture, transfection and plasmids
All cell lines were obtained from ATCC-LGC
(Wesel, Germany) or DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany).
SCCHN cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen,
Darmstadt, Germany) supplemented with 10% heat
inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, PAA, Cölbe,
Germany), 1% glutamine, 1% penicillin-streptomycin
and 1% non-essential amino acids (all from Invitrogen,
Darmstadt, Germany) . NIH-3T3 cells were cultured in
DMEM supplemented with 10% heat inactivated bovine
serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. NIH-3T3 cells
were transfected with pLERN-EGFRvIII (kind gift of
Frank Furnari, La Jolla, CA) with Lipofectamine 2000
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen,
Darmstadt, Germany) and selected with G418 (1000µg/
ml, Sigma, Munich, Germany). To measure proliferation,
SCCHN cells were split, reseeded (5x105 in 25cm2 flasks),
and counted at the indicated time points. Cells were then
replated at the initial density. The -fold increase in cell
number was calculated, all given results are based on
triplicate experiments. R763 [25] was kindly provided by
EMD-Serono (Rockland, MA). MLN8237 was purchased
from Selleck (Houston, TX).

Immunoblotting
Protein extracts (50µg per lane) were
electrophoretically separated on SDS-PAGE gels,
transferred to membranes (Protran, Schleicher&Schuell,
Dassel, Germany) and blotted with specific antibodies
as described earlier [43] (Actin, Aurora-A, Aurora-B: all
from Sigma, Munich, Germany; S10-HH3: Millipore,
Schwalbach, Germany; EGFR: Santa Cruz, Heidelberg,
Germany; pEGFR: Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany,
pAKT, pERK: both from New England Biolabs, Frankfurt,
Germany).

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using the
statistical functions (t-test if not otherwise indicated) of
GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). For
quantitative variables, means and standard deviations are
given, for categorical data absolute and relative frequencies.
The bars shown represent the mean ± standard deviation
(SD) or standard error of the mean (SEM). Spearman
rank correlation coefficient (r) was correlated to assess
the relationship between Aurora-A and EGFR expression.
Also for box plots showing medians, quantiles and ranges
as well as Kaplan-Meier survival analyses the Statistical
Package for Social Sciences (SPSS 17.0 Package Facility,
SPSS Inc, IL, USA) was used. Survival curves were
compared with the log-Rank test. Any p values given are
two-sided and subject to a local significance level of 0.05.

Flow cytometry and apoptosis assays
To assess apoptosis, 5x105 cells were stained with
FITC-labeled Annexin V (BD Pharmingen, Heidelberg,
Germany) and counterstained with propidium iodide
(PI, Sigma, Munich, Germany). Following incubation
cells were washed, resuspended in PBS, and analyzed by
flow cytometry. The fraction of Annexin V–positive (FL2
channel) PI-negative (FL3 channel) cells was reported
as apoptotic. For analysis of cell cycle distribution, cells
were fixed with 70% ethanol and stained with PI. Flow
cytometric analysis of DNA content was performed using
