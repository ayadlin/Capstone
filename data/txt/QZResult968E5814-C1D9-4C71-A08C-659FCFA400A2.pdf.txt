BACKGROUND. Low voriconazole levels have been associated with a higher failure
rate in patients with confirmed fungal infections.

METHODS. Steady-state plasma trough voriconazole levels were measured after at
least 5 days of therapy in 87 patients with hematologic malignancies on 201
separate occasions (1–5 levels per patient; median, 2). Most patients (90%) had
undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The daily voriconazole dose, administered in 2 divided doses, was 200 mg (n ¼ 4), 400 mg
(n ¼ 151), 500 mg (n ¼ 20), 600 mg (n ¼ 18), and 800 mg (n ¼ 8); corresponding
to 2.0–16.3 (median, 5.4) mg/kg. Plasma voriconazole levels were 0–12.5 lg/mL
(median, 1.2). Voriconazole was undetectable (<0.2 lg/mL) in 15%.

RESULTS. The correlation between dose and levels was weak (r ¼ 0.14; P ¼ .045).
The median absolute daily drug dose (400 mg) was identical in groups of patients
with levels of 0, 0.2 to 0.5, >0.5 to 2.0, >2.0 to 5.0, and >5.0. Whereas the daily
drug dose in mg/kg was significantly higher when the levels were >5.0 lg/mL,
there was no consistent relation between dose and level below that threshold. In

adult patients getting standard doses of voriconazole orally, the drug levels are
highly variable. Based on limited available data, between a quarter and twothirds of these levels could potentially be associated with a lower likelihood of
response or a higher likelihood of failure.

CONCLUSIONS. Future voriconazole studies should incorporate prospective therapeutic drug monitoring and consideration should be given to checking levels
in patients receiving the drug for confirmed, life-threatening fungal infections.

herapeutic drug monitoring is recommended when individualization of drug dose is required to ensure safety and efficacy.
There are limited data on the effects of monitoring drug levels and
therapeutic success in fungal infections.1–4 Because most of this evidence concerns itraconazole,1–4 the Infectious Diseases Society of
America guidelines recommend measurement of itraconazole trough
levels in patients requiring prolonged oral therapy.5 Targeting peak
serum flucytosine concentrations was suggested to prevent emergence of resistant strains and toxicity.6
Voriconazole is a triazole antifungal agent used in the treatment
of Aspergillus infections. It is metabolized by the liver cytochrome
P450 system and displays nonlinear pharmacokinetics. The period
after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is characterized by the use of multiple drugs that can affect the cytochrome
P450 system. In addition, the CP450 isoenzyme 2C19, which plays a

major role in voriconazole metabolism, exhibits significant genetic polymorphism. Homozygous extensive metabolizers (normal) have significantly lower
exposure than heterozygous extensive metabolizers
or poor metabolizers.7 In a preliminary study, we
showed significant differences in voriconazole plasma
levels in 25 HSCT recipients receiving similar doses of
voriconazole.8
There is an association between higher plasma
voriconazole levels and ocular toxicity.9,10 An association between successful therapeutic outcome in
Aspergillus infections and higher plasma voriconazole
concentrations has been reported recently.11 Analysis
of data for 249 patients from 6 Phase III clinical trials
of voriconazole has also shown a correlation between
drug levels and outcome.12 We recently found a relation between lower voriconazole levels and breakthrough infections with organisms susceptible to
voriconazole in a dose-dependent fashion.13
However, because of a lack of prospective data
the need for therapeutic voriconazole monitoring
remains to be established. In this study we review
our experience with voriconazole levels in HSCT recipients. The report includes some data that have been
published previously.8

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Pharmacy records were reviewed to identify all HSCT
recipients who had received voriconazole for at least 7
days and had trough plasma voriconazole concentrations measured using high-performance liquid chromatography14 between January 2003 and May 2006.
Steady-state trough blood levels of voriconazole were
measured at least 5 days after the drug was initiated.
This retrospective review was approved by Northwestern University’s Institutional Review Board as part of
a project evaluating outcome of allogeneic HSCT.
Our standard antifungal prophylaxis for allograft
recipients is itraconazole. We switch to voriconazole

when patients receive corticosteroids for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or have had a mold infection in the past. Voriconazole was given at the dose
of 200 mg twice daily orally in such patients. In
patients suspected to have aspergillosis, voriconazole
was initiated at the dose of 6 mg/kg twice daily for a
day, and then was continued at the dose of 4 mg/kg
twice daily. Immunosuppression comprised cyclosporine (matched sibling donors) or tacrolimus (unrelated
or mismatched donors). Additionally, recipients of
conventional-intensity allografts received methotrexate on Days 1, 3, 6, and 11 posttransplant, whereas
recipients of reduced-intensity transplants received
mycophenolate mofetil 1000 mg twice daily.

RESULTS
All patients had hematologic malignancies. Table 1
shows patient characteristics. Most patients had
undergone allogeneic HSCT, and three-quarters were
receiving the drug prophylactically. The absolute
daily drug dose was 400 mg in 75%.
As Table 2 shows, the drug was undetectable in
15% of the samples. The levels were <0.5 lg/mL in
27% of all samples and <2.0 lg/mL in 62% of all samples. The absolute voriconazole dose did not affect the
categoric distribution of levels significantly, as shown
by the P values (v2 test) in the table. Despite the seemingly different median drug levels (Table 2, column
3), none of the continuous comparisons (analysis of
variance [ANOVA]) of levels between different absolute
daily doses was significant (P ¼ .42.94) except the 1
between 400 mg and 800 mg (P ¼ .034).
As Figure 1 shows, the correlation between voriconazole level and the daily dose was poor (r ¼ 0.14;
P ¼ .051). However, as Table 3 shows, the daily mg/kg
dose was significantly higher when the drug level
was >5.0 lg/mL. Figure 2 shows levels in the 15

DISCUSSION
Our data show that in adult patients getting standard
doses of voriconazole orally, the drug levels are
highly variable. Based on the data on file at the Food
and Drugs Administration (FDA),12 27% of these
levels would be associated with a lower likelihood of
response. Based on the data of Smith et al,11 65% of
these levels would be associated with a higher likelihood of failure in patients with confirmed fungal
infections. Our own data, in a relatively small number of patients, suggest a relation between lower voriconazole levels and breakthrough infections with
organisms susceptible to the drug in a dose-dependent fashion.13 The retrospective nature of all the evidence limits the conclusions that can be drawn from
each individual study. However, when all available
data are considered in aggregate, there seems to be a

suggestion that voriconazole levels are variable, and
that there may be a relation between levels and likelihood of therapeutic success.
Voriconazole is primarily metabolized by the
liver and displays nonlinear saturation kinetics. Small
changes in dose can result in disproportionate
changes in plasma concentrations. Changes sometimes occur spontaneously—possibly related to concomitant medications or gastrointestinal problems
(eg, malabsorption related to GVHD). Figure 2 and
our previous study8 show this. In addition, differences in metabolism may occur because of genetic
polymorphism in the cytochrome P450 enzyme
2C19,resulting in higher and more prolonged exposure to voriconazole for patients who are heterozygous or homozygous poor metabolizers. Over 90% of
levels reported in this study were obtained when
patients were in the hospital—and usually had been
for a few days. Thus, each dose was verified as being
given via the medication administration record,
thereby eliminating compliance as a possible explanation for the variable results.
Although the evidence suggesting a relation
between voriconazole concentrations and efficacy is
increasing, there are no data on the magnitude of
the problem of potentially subtherapeutic levels. If
the proportion of patients with potentially subtherapeutic levels was small, there would be limited reason to monitor levels even if the consequences of
subtherapeutic levels were potentially severe. One
could simply check levels in patients failing to
respond to therapy as expected and increase the
dose if needed. However, our study suggests that the
proportion of levels that are potentially subtherapeutic is high enough to warrant prospective work. A
possible criticism of our study is that the patient
population is relatively heterogeneous and the condi-

tions under which the drug was used are not uniform. In fact, this could be considered a strength of
the study because it reflects real-life use of the drug.
Additional evidence supporting therapeutic drug
monitoring comes from pharmacodynamic data. In
vitro pharmacodynamic studies have shown that voriconazole, as with other triazoles, exhibits killing activity that is independent of peak concentrations,
with maximum fungicidal activity around 2–3 times
the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).15,16 An
in vivo murine Candidiasis study similarly reported
concentration-independent fungicidal activity, with
the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)/
MIC ratio being strongly predictive of treatment success.17 This suggests that maintaining drug levels
over the entire treatment interval (rather than peak
effect) is important.
The Antifungal Susceptibility Subcommittee of
the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute has
recently proposed interpretive breakpoints for voriconazole and Candida species based on a review of
laboratory and clinical data.18 The overall MIC90 was
0.25 lg/mL and 99% of the isolates were inhibited at
1 lg/mL of voriconazole. The MIC breakpoints proposed for voriconazole and Candida species are as
follows: susceptible, 1 lg/mL; susceptible dose-dependent, 2 lg/mL; and resistant 4 lg/mL.
Implicit in the formulation of the recommendations is the suggestion that voriconazole concentrations should be maintained >1 lg/mL over the entire
dosing interval (trough level). In our study, maintaining the trough concentration above clinical breakpoints was not consistently achieved because 89
levels (44%) were 1 lg/mL. Also, potentially subtherapeutic concentrations could not be predicted
from the absolute or mg/kg drug dose each patient
received.
Although this does not necessarily mean that
routine voriconazole therapeutic drug monitoring
should be started, we suggest that future studies of
voriconazole and other newer agents such as posaconazole should incorporate prospective therapeutic
drug monitoring.
