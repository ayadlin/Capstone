Summary
It has been proposed that an aggressive secondary cancer stem cell population arises from a
primary cancer stem cell population through acquisition of additional genetic mutations and drives
cancer progression. Overexpression of Polycomb protein EZH2, essential in stem cell selfrenewal, has been linked to breast cancer progression. However, critical mechanism linking
increased EZH2 expression to BTIC (breast tumor initiating cell) regulation and cancer
progression remains unclear. Here, we identify a mechanism in which EZH2 expression-mediated
downregulation of DNA damage repair leads to accumulation of recurrent RAF1 gene
amplification in BTICs, which activates p-ERK-β-catenin signaling to promote BTIC expansion.
We further reveal that AZD6244, a clinical trial drug that inhibits RAF1-ERK signaling, could
prevent breast cancer progression by eliminating BTICs.

Introduction
Accumulated evidence shows that cancer stem/progenitor cells (or tumor initiating cells,
TICs) account for cancer initiation, progression and drug resistance (Al-Hajj and Clarke,
2004; Reya et al., 2001; Rossi et al., 2008). TICs in different types of cancers have been
gradually identified, for example, breast tumor initiating cells (BTICs) can be isolated by
sorting for CD44+CD24−/low cells (Al-Hajj et al., 2003) or Hoechst negative side population
(SP) cells (Patrawala et al., 2005), and can also be enriched by suspension in spheroid

culture termed mammospheres and serial transplantations in immunodeficient mice (Ponti et
al., 2005). Compared to differentiated cells/non-stem cells with limited opportunity to
accumulate multiple lesions, long-lived stem/progenitor cells allow progression towards
malignancy through accumulation of epigenetic or genetic alterations that deregulate selfrenewal pathways (Rossi et al., 2008). It was proposed that a more aggressive secondary
cancer stem/progenitor cell population may arise from a primary cancer stem cell population
through acquisition of additional genetic mutations that deregulate cancer stem/progenitor
homeostasis and drive cancer progression (Visvader and Lindeman, 2008). Moreover,
studies showed that high grade tumors are enriched with a high content of TICs (Pece et al.).
However, the key components and molecular mechanisms contributing to TIC formation or
expansion are largely unknown.
Epigenetic regulation by Polycomb proteins is essential in maintaining the self-renewal
capability of embryonic and adult stem cells through mediating histone methylation at lysine
27 of histone H3 (H3K27) (Cao and Zhang, 2004; Ezhkova et al., 2009; Lessard and
Sauvageau, 2003; Sparmann and van Lohuizen, 2006). Interestingly, high expression of
EZH2, a key component of the Polycomb PRC2 complex, has been linked to aggressive
progression of breast and prostate cancers (Kleer et al., 2003; Varambally et al., 2002).
However, critical mechanisms linking increased EZH2 expression to BTIC regulation and
cancer progression remain unclear.

The importance of the tumor microenvironment in cancer has been increasingly recognized
(Hu and Polyak, 2008). The microenvironment of solid tumors contains regions of poor
oxygenation as a result of hypoxia. It is worthy to note that hypoxia/HIF1α activation is
associated with high grade basal breast cancer and poor prognosis (Bristow and Hill, 2008).
Using microarray-based gene expression profiles, previous studies have identified a group of
DNA damage repair genes that are downregulated by hypoxia, including RAD51 (Bindra et
al., 2007; Bindra and Glazer, 2007; Bindra et al., 2004). Interestingly, forced expression of
EZH2 in breast epithelial cells correlates with decreased expression of double-strand-break
repair protein RAD51 paralogs through an unknown mechanism (Zeidler et al., 2005).
Whether hypoxia associates with EZH2 on regulation of DNA damage repair remains to be
explored. More importantly, disruption of critical DNA damage repair proteins, such as
RAD51, is expected to result in a significant increase of spontaneous chromosomal break
and chromosome instability (Dodson et al., 2004), which could further lead to oncogenic
translocation and amplification (Difilippantonio et al., 2002).
This study is to identify a mechanism linking increased EZH2 expression to BTIC regulation
and cancer progression.

Results
Increased EZH2 expression in BTICs is linked to decreased RAD51 expression, enhanced
BTICs and high grade breast cancer
To understand whether EZH2 expression is involved in regulation of BTICs and cancer
progression, we examined the endogenous EZH2 expression level in the CD44+CD24−/low
cells isolated from human breast cancer and non-cancer cell lines, xenograft tumor cells, and
primary breast tumor cells. We found that EZH2 levels in the CD44+CD24−/low cells
positively correlate with the percentage of CD44+CD24−/low cells (Figure 1A). EZH2
expression was also enriched in the primary tumor cell populations highly expressing
ALDH1 (ALDH+) and OCT4 (OCT4+) (Figure S1A), both of which are known markers of
cancer stem cells/stem cells (Wicha, 2008). These data suggest EZH2 expression level may
play a role in regulating the BTIC population.

We then investigated whether EZH2 enables the accumulation of genomic/genetic
abnormalities to promote BTICs through repressing RAD51. Thus, similar to Figure 1A, we
examined the endogenous RAD51 expression levels in the CD44+CD24−/low cells isolated
from the abovementioned samples. We found that EZH2 expression was negatively
correlated with RAD51 expression in the CD44+CD24−/low cells (Figure 1B). Furthermore,
EZH2 expression was most elevated whereas RAD51 expression was most repressed in the
CD44+CD24−/low cells isolated from high grade/basal-like breast cancer cells (Figure 1A
and 1B), which are known to be associated with aggressive malignancy, high tumor grade
and poor prognosis, compared to those from less invasive/low tumor grade breast cancer
cells and to those from benign mammary cell line (Figure 1A and 1B). Consistent with the
primary cells and cell line data, high EZH2 expression was also significantly correlated with
high tumor grade in a cohort of human breast tumor sections (Table 1), where EZH2
expression was negatively correlated with RAD51 expression (Table 2). Together, these data
suggest a link between EZH2 and RAD51 expression in the regulation of BTICs and cancer
progression.
Elevated expression of EZH2 in BTICs downregulates RAD51 expression and increases
genomic abnormality

To investigate if elevated EZH2 expression indeed plays a role in promoting BTICs, human
primary tumor cells enriched for BTICs by sorting with CD44+CD24−/low marker were
infected with retrovirus expressing EZH2 or other indicated constructs (Figure S1B), and
then maintained in suspension culture to produce mammospheres. Mammospheres still
contained 87% CD44+CD24−/low cells after 7 days of culture in suspension and could be
differentiated in conditions as previously described (Dontu et al., 2003) and (Ponti et al.,
2005) (Figure S1C). To ensure EZH2 expression level is physiological relevant, we
purposely increased the EZH2 level in the low tumor grade BTICs (PT1) to a level that is
comparable to the physiologically high EZH2 level in the high tumor grade BTICs (PT2)
(PT1+EZH2 vs. PT2, Figure 1C). We found that ectopic expression of EZH2 downregulated
RAD51 mRNA and protein in the BTICs from human primary tumor cells (Figure 1D, left
and upper right), whereas knocking-down EZH2 using small hairpin RNA (shRNA)
increased RAD51 mRNA and protein expression (Figure 1D, left and lower right). Through
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we found that the PRC2 complex proteins including
EZH2 and SUZ12 as well as PRC1 component (BMI1) (Figure 1E) were recruited and
bound to the putative Polycomb response element (PRE) containing PHO motif and GAGA
motif within the RAD51 promoter (Figure S1D) (Sing et al., 2009), where EZH2 and
H3K27Me3 co-occupied (Figure 1F). In addition, RAD51 transcription was suppressed by
wild-type EZH2 but not by the methyl-transferase deleted mutant (ΔSET), suggesting that
H3K27 histone methylation mediated by EZH2 involves in the silencing of RAD51
transcription (Figure S1E). Accordingly, downregulation of EZH2 by shRNA reduced
H3K27 histone methylation within RAD51 promoter (Figure 1E), which could thereby
increase RAD51 expression as shown in Figure 1D.
To determine the biological effects resulting from EZH2-RAD51 regulation, we examined
changes in DNA lesions/aberrations given the critical role of RAD51 in DNA damage
repair. We found that EZH2-mediated downregulation of RAD51 induced a substantial
amount of spontaneous DNA damage indicated by the increased comet tail formation (Singh
et al., 1988), which was blocked by co-expression of a retroviral promoter driven-RAD51
plasmid that is free from the transcriptional repression by EZH2 (Figure 1G). Furthermore,
ectopic EZH2 expression in BTIC-enriched cells significantly increased chromosome
karyotype aberrations, including chromosome breaks, deletions and translocations, which
were reduced by co-expression of RAD51 (Figure 1H, representative morphology of
abnormal karyotypes is shown in Figure S1F). Next we inquired whether physiological

expression level of EZH2 is also related to chromosomal abnormalities in a cohort of tumor
samples. It is noted that centrosome amplification, a hallmark of genomic instability, has
been observed in cells deficient in DNA damage repair proteins, such as RAD51 (Dodson et
al., 2004). Thus, we examined endogenous EZH2 level and centrosome number in a cohort
of human breast tumors. We found that high expression level of endogenous EZH2
significantly correlates with high centrosome amplification (Figure 1I), indicating the
clinical relevance of EZH2-enhanced genomic instability in cancer. Taken together, EZH2
likely plays a role in accumulating genomic abnormalities through repression of RAD51
expression in the BTIC-enriched population, which may lead to deregulated signaling
required for tumor progression.
Increased EZH2 expression enhances self-renewal and expansion of BTICs

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Next, we asked whether EZH2-RAD51 regulation directly affects BTICs. We found that
ectopically expressing EZH2 in human primary breast tumor cells increased the percentage
of SP cells (Figure 2A) and CD44+CD24−/low cells (Figure 2B), which was suppressed upon
RAD51 co-expression (Figure 2A and Figure 2B). Similar to ectopically expressing EZH2,
knocking down RAD51 significantly enhanced the abundance of SP cells (Figure 2A). To
determine if EZH2 expands BTICs through enhancing the self-renewing capacity, we
examined serially propagated mammosphere formation in vitro and mammary xenograft
tumor formation in vivo using primary tumor cells (PT1). Increased expression of EZH2
effectively enhanced primary and secondary mammosphere formation (Figure 2C), which
could generate xenograft tumors with 10-fold fewer cells than the control group (Please see
later, Table S3). Moreover, the mammospheres expressing EZH2 contained 2–3 fold more
cells per sphere, leading to enlarged sphere size (Figure 2D), and suggesting EZH2 may also
promote BTIC proliferation and/or survival. In contrast, RAD51 co-expression, at least in
part, dampened the EZH2 enhanced mammosphere number and size (Figure 2C–2D).
Similar results were observed in BTIC-enriched sphere cultures generated from two other
primary tumor samples (data not shown). Taken together, our data suggest that EZH2
expands highly self-renewing BTICs through the downregulation of RAD51.
Hypoxia physiologically increases EZH2 expression, decreases RAD51 transcription and
enhances BTICs

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further investigate the physiological relevance of EZH2 expression promotion of BTICs,
we looked for physiological relevant conditions that may be involved in the regulation of
EZH2 expression. Using promoter analysis (Genomatix®), we found a consensus sequence
of HIF response element (HRE: NCGTG) within EZH2 promoter region. To test whether
hypoxia might regulate EZH2 expression, we subjected primary breast tumor cells (PT1) to
normoxic (20% O2) and hypoxic (1% O2) conditions and found that hypoxia significantly
induces luciferase activity driven by EZH2 promoter containing a wild-type HRE, but not
driven by EZH2 promoter with a mutated HRE (Figure 3A). Mutation of the HRE abolished
induction of EZH2 luciferase activity by hypoxia, suggesting HIF transcription factor may
mediate EZH2 activation by hypoxia (Figure 3A). Indeed, using a specific HIF1α antibody
for ChIP analysis, we found HIF1α directly binds to the HRE-containing EZH2 promoter
under hypoxic conditions (Figure 3B). These data suggest that upregulated HIF1α upon
hypoxia treatment likely transactivates EZH2 gene and increases EZH2 expression. We next
asked whether hypoxia may induce EZH2 expression in BTICs and found that the high level
of EZH2 was further increased by hypoxia in CD44+CD24−/low BTICs, however, the EZH2
level remained low in non-CD44+CD24−/low cells even under hypoxia conditions (Figure
3C). In support of the results in Figure 2, RAD51 mRNA (Figure 3D) and protein (Figure
3E) levels were significantly repressed by increased EZH2 expression under hypoxia in
BTIC-enriched cells, and knocking-down EZH2 by shRNA reversed hypoxia mediatedRAD51 repression (Figure 3D–3E). Knocking-down EZH2 also abolished the induction of

BTICs (Figure 3F) and mammosphere formation (Figure 3G) by hypoxia, suggesting that
hypoxia-mediated EZH2 upregulation was required for both the increased hypoxia-enhanced
CD44+CD24−/low cell population and mammosphere formation. Together, our results
suggest EZH2 expression is induced by a hypoxic microenvironment, leading to repression
of RAD51 (Figure 3D–3E) and enhancement of BTIC population (Figure 3F–3G). These
data provide additional support for the physiological link between induction of EZH2
expression, repression of RAD51 and enhancement of BTIC population, which are
consistent with the results obtained by using the ectopic expression system.
EZH2-RAD51 regulation induces RAF1 amplification and downstream p-ERK-β-catenin
activation in BTICs

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further characterize the downstream target(s) that mediate BTIC promotion by EZH2RAD51 regulation, we cross referenced the results of two protein arrays generated with
lysates from BTIC enriched-cells expressing EZH2 and shRAD51. Compared to the vector
control, ectopically expressing EZH2 or knocking-down RAD51 in BTIC enriched-cells
most significantly increased RAF1 protein expression (Figure 4A, Table. S1). Since
downregulation of RAD51 induces double strand breaks and chromosome abnormalities,
such as gene amplification, we examined if the enhanced RAF1 expression is due to
amplification of the RAF1 gene. Using an unbiased SNP array analysis to examine genomic
copy number variation in BTIC enriched-cells expressing vector control compared with
BTIC enriched-cells expressing EZH2, we found that, indeed, RAF1 gene copy number was
amplified by high EZH2 expression (Figure 4B left panel, Table S2), which was further
validated by quantitative PCR analysis using genomic DNA of BTIC enriched-cells from
two human primary tumor cells, PT1 and PT3 (Figure 4B right panel).

Previously we showed that activated ERK, a prime target downstream of RAF1, enhances
stabilization of functional β-catenin in the nucleus through inhibiting GSK3β-meidated
phosphorylation of N-terminus of β-catenin (Ding et al., 2005). It is worth noting that
unphosphorylated (activated) β-catenin plays important roles in maintaining TIC survival,
proliferation and self renewal (Guo et al., 2008; Li et al., 2003; Reya et al., 2003; Taipale
and Beachy, 2001). Increased unphosphorylated (activated) β-catenin also contributes to
radiation-resistance in BTICs (Chen et al., 2007). To understand whether EZH2 inducedRAF1 amplification activates the ERK-β-catenin signaling pathway in BTICs, we examined
expression of RAF1, p-ERK and unphosphorylated β-catenin by immunoblotting and
intracellular staining using an established antibody that only recognizes unphosphorylated
(activated) β-catenin (Guo et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2007). Indeed, we found that RAF1
amplification is concurrently correlated with the upregulation of RAF1 downstream targets
p-ERK and unphosphorylated β-catenin in CD44+CD24−/low BTICs isolated from human
primary tumor cells (Figure 4C–4D). RAF1 amplification potentially resulted from
repressed RAD51 expression by EZH2 as co-expression of RAD51 blocked activation of pERK-β-catenin signaling (Figure 4C–4D). Together, these results imply that induced RAF1
amplification and downstream p-ERK-β-catenin activation by EZH2-RAD51 regulation in
BTICs could contribute to promoting survival, proliferation and self renewal of the BTICs.
Increased EZH2 expression physiologically enhances RAF1-ERK-β-catenin signaling in
BTICs
To further reveal the physiological relevance between EZH2 and RAF1-ERK-β-catenin
activation in primary BTICs, we examined the protein levels RAF1, p-ERK and
unphosphorylated β-catenin under EZH2 induction by hypoxia in CD44+CD24−/low cells
using intracellular staining analysis. Consistent with the results shown in Figure 4D,
increased EZH2 expression by hypoxia enhanced expression of RAF1, p-ERK and
unphosphorylated β-catenin, whereas knocking-down EZH2 by shRNA significantly

reversed the hypoxia-activated RAF1-ERK-β-catenin signaling in CD44+CD24−/low cells
(Figure S2A). We found that EZH2 expression positively correlates with endogenous RAF1
and unphosphorylated β-catenin expression in all three BTIC populations from three
individual breast tumor samples (Figure S2B). Together, these data support the results
obtained in the ectopic expression system (Figure 4D) that increased EZH2 expression in
BTICs resulted in activation of RAF1-ERK-β-catenin signaling.
EZH2-induced activation of RAF1-p-ERK-β-catenin signaling is positively correlated with
breast cancer progression

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To elucidate the clinical relevance of EZH2 and RAF1-ERK-β-catenin activation in breast
cancer, we first examined association between endogenous EZH2 and RAF1 levels by reanalyzing cDNA Microarray databases from an established human breast cancer study (Chin
et al., 2006). We found that endogenous EZH2 was highly expressed in aggressive high
stage (stage 3–4) tumors, where RAF1 expression was significantly correlated with EZH2
expression (Figure 4E). We next asked whether overexpression of RAF1 in those tumors
expressing high level of endogenous EZH2 is due to RAF1 amplification at the genomic
level. In a cohort of human breast tumor sections, over 60% of high grade (II, III) breast
tumors showed high EZH2 expression (Table 1). These tumors with high level of
endogenous EZH2 frequently exhibited RAF1 gene amplification (Figure 4F, right). On the
contrary, RAF1 amplification did not occur in any of the low grade tumors in which 90% of
them showed none or low EZH2 expression (Table 1). Furthermore, EZH2 expression was
negatively correlated with RAD51 but positively correlated with RAF1, p-ERK and βcatenin expression in these high grade, poorly-differentiated breast carcinoma by
immunohistochemistry analysis (Figure 4F, Figure 4G and Table 2). Together, these data
support the notion that EZH2, through downregulating RAD51, induces RAF1 amplification
and downstream p-ERK-β-catenin activation, which may contribute significantly to promote
BTICs and aggravate breast cancer malignancy.
EZH2-amplified RAF1 signaling enhances survival and proliferation of BTICs

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To dissect the dynamics of EZH2-amplified RAF1 signaling in regulating survival of the
BTIC population, we monitored RAF1 gene copy number following the time course of
mammospheric cell division from single cell suspension enriched for BTICs (Figure S3A).
During the first 48 hours after seeding, RAD51 was repressed by EZH2 expression (Figure
S3B), and we observed approximately 1.3–1.5 fold more cell death of EZH2-infected
mammospheric cells compared to vector-infected mammospheric cells with etoposide
treatment (Figure S3C), which is consistent with a previous report showing that repression
of RAD51 leads to enhanced cell death (Zeidler et al., 2005). However, we found that the
EZH2-infected cells start to show decreased cell death compared to the vector control at 72
hours after seeding (Figure S3C) when RAF1 amplification also evidently occurs (Figure
S3D). Additionally, EZH2-infected CD44+CD24−/low cells showed resistance to etoposide
induced-cell death (Figure S3E) whereas ectopic expression of EZH2 in nonCD44+CD24−/low led to increased cell death upon etoposide treatment (Figure S3E),
indicating distinct differences between stem/progenitor cell enriched-populations and nonstem/progenitor cells. Together, these data suggest that enhanced EZH2 expression may
amplify RAF1 signaling in BTICs and play a role in promoting survival of the BTICs.
To further assess the biological function of EZH2-amplified RAF1 signaling in regulating
BTICs, we isolated three distinct cell populations expressing low EZH2-low RAF1, high
EZH2-low RAF1, and high EZH2-high RAF1 (low EZH2-high RAF1 population is absent)
from hypoxia treated-primary tumor cells using intracellular staining (Figure 5A). We next
determined the proportion of the CD44+CD24−/low cells in each of the three populations and
proliferation status of these CD44+CD24−/low cells by BrdU-FITC staining. Among the

three populations (Figure 5A), cells expressing high EZH2-high RAF1 had the most
abundant CD44+CD24−/low cell population with the highest proliferation rate (BrdU+)
(Figure 5B and 5C). Consistent with this data, expression of constitutively activated RAF1
(w22) in human primary tumor cells substantially increased mammosphere number and size
(Figure 5D). Together, these data support the notion that amplified RAF1 signaling may not
only play a role in promoting BTIC survival but is also essential for enhancing proliferation
of BTICs.
A potential model of DSB induced-RAF1 amplification and expansion of RAF1-amplified
BTICs

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

It was shown that repression of RAD51 leads to decreased DNA damage repair and
increased double strand breaks (DSB) (van Gent et al., 2001). DSB generates gene
amplification through a well-established model- Break-Fusion-Bridge (BFB) cycles (Ford
and Fried, 1986). The broken end of the bridge can fuse to sister chromatid during DNA
synthesis and starts a fusion-bridge cycle (Figure S3F). Each cycle will generate at least an
additional copy of the amplified gene. Given the critical role of RAD51 in DSB repair, we
asked whether RAD51 repression could lead to RAF1 amplification through DSB inducedBFB cycles. By using FISH probes targeting RAF1 gene (red) and a co-amplified marker
centromeric to RAF1 (green), we found that EZH2-expressed BTICs show inverted
duplication of amplified RAF1 gene region, a distinct product from BFB process, suggesting
that RAD51 repression leads to RAF1 amplification through DSB induced-BFB cycles
(Figure S3G).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further understand whether rapid amplification of the RAF gene occurs in a small
number of cells as a result of having a selective advantage to outgrow the population, or
whether there is amplification broadly in the population that somehow specifically targets
the RAF gene by an unknown mechanism, we monitored dynamic accumulation of RAF1
amplification in BTICs by FISH (Figure S3H). The number of RAF1-amplified cells from
BTIC-enriched primary tumor cells was graphed against the generation number for four
generations. We found that RAF1 amplification firstly occurs in a small population of
BTICs (3–5% in the first generation) and then expands to ~60% in the fourth generation,
which suggests an outgrowth advantage of the RAF1-amplified cell population from EZH2expressed BTICs (Figure S3I). Since it was shown that HR predominantly repairs DSBs in
the S phase and that DSBs caused by HR deficiency are usually replication associated
(Branzei et al., 2008), we think the original BTIC population that undergoes replication is
likely to be the very first population prone to DSBs and RAF1 amplification. To test this
hypothesis, we co-stained Vector-or EZH2-infected BTICs in the first generation with
antibodies against BrdU and γ-H2AX, a marker for DSBs. As compared to the Vectorexpressed BTICs which showed no DSB formation (Figure S3J, upper panel), spontaneous
DSBs caused by EZH2 expression predominantly accumulated in the BrdU-positive cells
(Figure S3J, lower panel). Furthermore, there was around 5–10% replicating BTICs in the
zero-first generation (Figure S3K), half of which would have DSBs and potentially generate
RAF1 amplification through BFB cycles in the first generation. This result is consistent with
the percentage of RAF1 amplified population (3–5%) shown in Figure S3I. These 3–5%
BTICs carrying EZH2-RAF1 amplification had enhanced proliferation and self-renewal,
which enable them to gradually outgrow the other populations (Figure 2, Figure 5 and
Figure S3I). Together, our results suggest that RAF1 amplification could be a direct result of
EZH2-mediated RAD51 repression through accumulation of DSBs followed by BFB cycles,
which may preferentially occur in a replicating BTIC population.

AZD6244 eliminates BTICs and mammary tumor formation by inhibiting RAF1-MEK-ERK-βcatenin activation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To explore if therapeutic agents that block the RAF-β-catenin activation are able to
eliminate EZH2-induced BTIC expansion, we tested sorafenib (Nexavar), a clinically used
RAF inhibitor and an FDA-approved anti-cancer drug compared to several clinical cancer
therapeutics (imatinib, laptinib, Taxol) and a pharmacological agent that kills cancer cells by
activating p53 (Reactivation of p53 and Induction of Tumor Apoptosis, RITA). Sorafenib
was the most effective in eliminating CD44+CD24−/low population from BT549 cancer cells
(Figure S4A). Sorafenib also significantly decreased CD44+CD24−/low cells from various
basal breast cancer cell lines (Figure S4B). Additionally, sorafenib preferentially inhibited
EZH2 promoted-BTICs which were under treatment in vitro (Figure S4C–4D) or were
isolated from xenograt tumors of the treated mice in vivo (Figure S4E–4F). Sorafenib also
abolished EZH2 promoted-mammosphere formation from primary tumor cells as well as
from xenograft tumor cells (Figure S4D–4F). Furthermore, knocking-down RAF1 with
shRNAs recapitulated the effect of sorafenib in decreasing CD44+CD24−/low BTIC
population from human primary tumor cells and also suppressed BTIC xenograft tumor
formation (Figure 6A and Table S3). These data suggest that the RAF1 activation pathway is
ubiquitously shared and functionally important in EZH2-promoted BTICs. To block ERK
activation, we used a specific MEK/ERK inhibitor AZD6244 that has been tested in multiple
clinical trials. We found that AZD6244 preferentially eliminates EZH2-expressed
CD44+CD24−/low cells and mammospheres (Figure 6B). Furthermore, AZD6244
significantly decreased p-ERK (Figure 6C) and unphosphorylated β-catenin (Figure 6C), and
also abolished xenograft tumor formation generated from the primary BTICs that had been
pretreated with AZD6244 (Table S3). To determine if AZD6244 also affects BTICs in vivo,
we applied AZD6244 to the mice bearing xenograft tumors that were generated from the
primary BTICs highly expressing EZH2. Consistent with the in vitro results, AZD6244
inhibited p-ERK (Figure 6D), suppressed CD44+CD24−/low cells (Figure 6E, left), and
abolished formation of mammospheres (Figure 6E, right and lower panel) which were
recovered from the xenograft tumors in a dose-dependent manner compared to the vehicle
treated group. All these data suggest that activation of RAF1-ERK-β-catenin signaling likely
plays a role in promoting BTIC expansion and that inhibiting RAF1-MEK-ERK-β-catenin
activation by AZD6244 or sorafenib eliminates EZH2-promoted BTICs.

Discussion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Our study reveals a mechanism in which EZH2 promotes BTIC expansion and cancer
progression. We found that RAD51 downregulation by EZH2 leads to impaired DNA
damage repair and accumulation of oncogenic hits in favor of promoting BTICs, such as
RAF1-β-catenin activation in BTICs (Figure 6F). These findings suggest that targeting the
EZH2/Polycomb complex and its downstream activation pathways, such as RAF1-ERK
signaling by AZD6244, may be effective for eliminating BTICs and intervening breast
cancer recurrence.
The long-lived stem/progenitor cells can be a reservoir for accumulation of the genetic or
epigenetic events required for oncogenic transformation (Rossi et al., 2008). Unrepaired
DNA damage likely allows sufficient oncogenic hits to accrue in stem/progenitor cells and
their progeny. Although it was reported that DNA damage leads to stem/progenitor cell
senescence by activating tumor suppressors such as p16INK4a (Rossi et al., 2008), DNA
damage induced by EZH2 overexpression likely bypasses this defense mechanism through
polycomb-mediated silencing of p16INK4a and p19Arf expression (Bracken et al., 2007;
Tzatsos and Bardeesy, 2008), and thereby prevents EZH2 expanded-BTICs from exhaustion.
Moreover, cancer stem/progenitor cells show enhanced regulation of ROS scavenging
(Diehn et al., 2009) and anti-apoptosis (Konopleva et al., 2002) compared to non-stem cell

populations. Therefore, RAF1 amplification induced by RAD51 downregulation may be a
"necessary but not sufficient" effect of RAD51 on BTICs, and these compensatory
mechanisms might help sustain stem/progenitor cell survival under DNA damage and
genomic instability induced by EZH2 overexpression, which could further lead to
deregulated signaling changes enabling BTICs to outgrow and expand.
HIF mRNA was shown to be upregulated in the stem cell population from glioma tumors
compared to the non-stem cell population (Li et al., 2009), which may provide an
explanation for our observation that EZH2 is highly expressed and induced by hypoxia in
the BTIC population compared to non-BTICs. Moreover, it was indicated that RAD51
repression by hypoxia is mediated by repressive E2F4/p130 complexes that bind to the
proximal promoter of the gene (Bindra et al, 2006). Consistent with this, in our study, we
show that EZH2 binds to RAD51 proximal promoter which contains a putative Polycomb
Response Element (Figure 1F and Figure S1D). Moreover, we found that E2F4 binds to
EZH2 by immunoprecipitation analysis (data not shown), which suggest that both EZH2 and
E2F4 may mediate RAD51 repression as a big repressive complex.

Though DNA repair response or expression of certain DNA damage response/ repair
proteins have been reported to be elevated in cancer stem cells from a couple different
models (Bao et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2008), few of these molecules have been functionally
characterized. In addition, different from RAD51 mediated-”error-free” DNA repair
mechanism, the increased DNA damage repair capacity in the above-mentioned studies
might be mediated through enhanced “error-prone” DNA damage repair mechanisms, which
could in turn to result in chromosomal aberrations and genomic instability (Aguilera and
Gomez-Gonzalez, 2008; Rassool et al., 2007). Furthermore, in support of our study, loss of a
DSB repair protein BRCA1 has recently been shown to expand mammary luminal
progenitor cells (Liu et al., 2008). RAD51 is the crucial partner of BRCA1 for mediating the
error-free DNA damage repair by homologous recombination (van Gent et al., 2001).
Further studies needed to be carried out in order to elucidate the relationship between
various DNA repair mechanisms/molecules and the regulation of BTICs.

The functional association between these amplicons in BTICs is currently under
investigation. Although genomic alterations have been observed in a wide range of human
diseases, genomic alterations that occur in stem/progenitor cells or tumor initiating cells are
poorly characterized. Among the genomic loci that are highly amplified by increased
expression of EZH2 (Table S3), 12p13.31 gain has been shown to correlate with basal breast
cancer (Chin et al., 2006), and 17q23.1 gain is especially frequent in BRCA1 associated
breast cancer (Sinclair et al., 2002). Particularly, the RAF1 gene on 3p25.2 was found
recurrently amplified or rearranged in multiple human cancers, where genomic aberrant
RAF1 gene often associates with cancer aggressiveness and relapse (Hajj et al., 1990).
Activation of RAF-MAPK pathway is also critical to inducing EMT and metastasis, traits
that are recently associated with stem cell properties (Thiery et al., 2009). Furthermore,
overexpression of wild-type RAF1 is sufficient to induce tumorgenesis in vivo (Kerkhoff et
al., 2000), suggesting expression level of RAF1 is a critical parameter for tumor initiation
and development. Based on our and others’ observations, more than 50% of aggressive
breast tumors show EZH2 overexpression (Kleer et al., 2003, Table 1), and more than onethird of these tumors exhibit RAF1 amplification (Figure 4F), which potentially mark the
tumors with high content of BTICs and aggressive malignancy. Consistent with the studies
showing that high grade tumors are enriched in high content of TICs (Pece et al.), our results
suggest that EZH2 amplified-RAF1 signaling may play a role in expanding an aggressive
sub-population of BTICs which promotes cancer progression. Therefore, our study reveals
an important clinical implication of using RAF1/MEK/ERK inhibitor in single agent or in
combination for intervening cancer progression and recurrence.

Experimental Procedures
Cell culture

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Isolation and culture of mammospheres from multiple primary human breast cancer samples
or xenograft tumors were performed as described in Ponti et al. and Dontu et al.
Differentiated cell cultures were kept in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum on collagen coated dish (BD Biosciences). Primary tumor samples were acquired
from breast cancer patients with informed consent and experimental procedures were
conducted with approval by the University of Texas MD Anderson Institutional Review
Board.
ChIP analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Chromatin immunoprecipitations were modified from the EZ-CHIP (Upstate) protocol using
antibodies: anti-HIF1α (Abcam), anti-EZH2 (Zymed), anti-SUZ12 (Abcam), anti-Bmi1
(Abcam) and anti-H3K27Me3 (Upstate). For sequential ChIP: the first elute
immunoprecipitated by anti-EZH2 was further immunoprecipitated by anti-H3K27Me3 and
IgG antibodies. The percentage of the bound DNA was quantified against the original DNA
input. Primer sequences used for ChIP-PCR are as follows:
RAD51-5’cccccggcataaagtttgaat3’ (forward); 5’gaagcgccgcactctcctta3’ (reverse) (PCR
product containing polycomb response element, see Figure S1D). GAPDH promoter was
used as a negative control. For details, please see Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
FACS analysis
Cells were dissociated with trypsin, washed, and resuspended in PBS as single-cell
suspension. Cells were then stained with indicated dye/antibodies: Hoechst 33342 (sigma),
Anti-CD24-PE (BD Pharmingen), Anti-CD44-FITC and CD44-APC (BD Pharmingen). To
analyze activated β-catenin, cells were stained with surface markers (CD24 and CD44),
fixed, permeabilized, and then stained with anti-unphosphorylated β-catenin (8E4) (Axxora),
anti-EZH2 (Cell Signaling), anti-p-ERK (Cell Signaling), RAF1, γ-H2AX, BrdU-FITC,
BrdU-PE (BD Transduction Laboratories). These cells were washed twice and then stained
with secondary antibodies conjugated with APC or PerCP-Cy5.5 (Jackson
ImmunoResearch). The immunoflourescence was evaluated by BD FACS Canto II (BD
Immunocytometry Systems) and analyzed by FCS3 Express Research Lite Edition (Denovo
Software). Cell sorting was performed by BD FACS Aria.
Mammary xenograft tumor

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Mammary fat pads of female NOD/SCID mice were inoculated with indicated number of
isolated CD44+CD24−/low cells or non-CD44+CD24−/low cells for a total volume of 100 µl
per injection site. After 12 weeks, all of the tumors were calculated and animals were
sacrificed. For the in vivo treatment, AZD6244 or sorafanib prepared as described in the
previous studies (Huynh et al.) was given orally to the mice that had been inoculate with 105
CD44+CD24−/low cells with the indicated doses when the tumors were grown for 2 weeks
(tumor size 50mm3). All surgical procedures and animal manipulations were performed
under regulations of Division of Laboratory Animal Medicine at The University of Texas
MD Anderson Cancer Center. Animal protocols (#06–87–06138) were reviewed and
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at The University of Texas
MD Anderson Cancer Center.
IHC staining and Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis
Immunohistochemical staining was performed as previously described (Ding et al., 2005).
FISH was performed on paraffin embedded breast tumor slides or freshly isolated BTICs

Significance

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Tumor initiating cells are suggested to be responsible for initiation and aggressive
progression of cancer. We show that enhanced expression of Polycomb protein EZH2 in
BTICs (breast tumor initiating cells) results in downregulation of DNA damage repair
protein and accumulation of genomic abnormalities that mediate deregulated signaling
(RAF1-ERK-β-catenin) promoting BTIC expansion and cancer progression. Our findings
also indicate that the cancer-predisposed microenvironment, such as hypoxia, may
promote BTICs through upregulating EZH2 expression. Our data further provide
evidences linking a specific genomic aberration mediated by EZH2-impaired DNA
damage response to expansion of BTICs. Together, this study reveals a previously
unidentified therapeutic effect of RAF1-ERK signaling inhibitors to prevent breast cancer
progression by eliminating BTICs and elucidates important clinical implications.

Illustration showing RAD51 is down-regulated by EZH2 in BTIC-enriched population,
leading to impaired DNA damage repair and accumulation of oncogenic hits that promote
BTICs (e.g. RAF1 amplification). Targeting the RAF1-ERK-β-catenin activation pathway
with therapeutic reagents like AZD6244 and sorafenib can be effective for eliminating
BTICs. See also Figure S4 and Table S3.
