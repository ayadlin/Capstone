Abstract
REarranged during Transfection (RET) fusion genes are detected in approximately
1% of lung adenocarcinomas and known primarily as oncogenic driver factors. Here,
we found a novel RET fusion gene, KIAA1217-RET, and examined the functional
differences of RET51 and RET9 protein, fused with KIAA1217 in cancer progression
and drug response. KIAA1217-RET, resulting from the rearrangement of chromosome
10, was generated by the fusion of KIAA1217 exon 11 and RET exon 11 from a
non-small cell lung cancer patient. Expression of this gene led to increased cell growth
and invasive properties through activations of the PI3K/AKT and ERK signaling
pathways and subsequently enabled oncogenic transformation of lung cells. We
observed that cells expressing KIAA1217-RET9 fusion protein were more sensitive
to vandetanib than those expressing KIAA1217-RET51 and both isoforms attenuated
cellular growth via cell cycle arrest. These results demonstrated that KIAA1217-RET 
fusion represents a novel oncogenic driver gene, the products of which are sensitive
to vandetanib treatment, and suggested that the KIAA1217-RET-fusion gene is a
promising target for lung cancer treatment.

Introduction

cytoplasm. The KIAA1217 gene that fuses to RET kinase has
two CCDs and can induce aberrant activation of RET kinase
through CCD-dependent dimerization. Here, we discovered
a novel KIAA1217-RET fusion in NSCLC and demonstrated
its potential biological significance as an oncogenic driver
and pro-invasive gene using both in vivo and in vitro assays.
Furthermore, we described the effects of vandetanib in RET
fusion-positive lung cells.

Recent advances in sequencing technology enabled
the comprehensive detection of rearrangements in the
cancer genome and transcriptome [1]. Chromosomal
rearrangements involving receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTKs) are an important class of cancer-related somatic
variation and have emerged as oncogenic drivers in cancer
progression [2]. More importantly, a number previous
reports, describing the oncogenic behavior and therapeutic
response of fusion genes in selected groups have shown
their clinical benefits [3, 4]. For example, patients having
EML4-ALK fusion in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
are highly responsive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib and
ceritinib [5]. The success of crizotinib reinforces the
importance identifying of the oncogenic fusion genes and
assessing their sensitivity to therapeutics.
The rearranged-during-transfection (RET) protooncogene is located in the pericentromeric region
of chromosome 10q11.2 and encodes a single-pass
transmembrane RTK [6]. The RET rearrangement has been
identified in approximately 1–2% of NSCLC patients [7–9].
To date, genomic rearrangement of RET combined with
kinesin family member 5B (KIF5B) has been identified with
more than 10 variations, displaying a variety of breakage
positions within the KIF5B locus [3,  10]. Additionally,
five other RET fusion partner genes have been identified:
CCDC6 (coiled-coil domain containing 6), CUX1 (cutlike homeobox 1), TRIM33 (tripartite-motif containing 33),
NCOA4 (nuclear-receptor coactivator 4), and KIAA1468
[11–15]. The transformation potential of the KIF5B-RET or
CCDC6-RET fusions has been reported in Ba/F3 cells and
LC-2/ad, the human lung-adenocarcinoma cell line [9, 11, 16].
Similar results were observed in NIH3T3  cells displaying
anchorage-independent cell proliferation [9, 17, 18].
RET tyrosine kinase is generally expressed at very
low levels in normal lung but, oncogenic RET is activated
by point mutations within its tyrosine kinase domain or
genomic rearrangements that produce chimeric RET
proteins. These RET fusion proteins frequently contain
coiled-coil domains (CCDs) within their partner genes
and result in aberrant activation of RET kinase by their
CCD-dependent homodimerization [2,  19,  20]. RET
dimerization and autophosphorylation via intracellular
tyrosine residues 1062 (pY1062) and pY1096 (in the
RET51 isoform only) recruit adaptor and signaling
proteins to stimulate multiple downstream molecules
[6]. Consequently, signaling pathways related to cell
proliferation and survival are activated, including the
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT, extracellularsignal regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein
(MAP) kinase, and STAT3 pathways [21–24].
KIAA1217 [also known as SKT, the human homolog of
murine Skt (Sickle tail)], the novel RET-fusion partner gene
identified in this study, is required for normal development
of intervertebral disks, and is ubiquitously expressed in the

Results
Identification of the KIAA1217-RET fusion gene
Previously, we screened for ALK, ROS1, and RET
fusion genes in 795  lung adenocarcinoma specimens
and identified the novel KIAA1217-RET fusion gene
containing KIAA1217 exon 11 and RET exon 11 [7, 25]
from a patient with a 4-cm tumor mass (Figure  1A,
red arrow). Hematoxylin and -eosin staining revealed
an adenocarcinoma with a predominant acinar pattern
(Figure 1B and 1C), and the immunohistochemistry results
showed that the RET protein was mainly localized in the
cytoplasm (Figure 1D). In most cell types, RET proteins
localize at the plasma membrane [21] however, RET fusion
proteins could be changed in its localization depending on
their partner gene such as CCDC6 and NCOA4, which are
localized in cytoplasm [7]. The RET fusion was confirmed
by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis,
resulting a split between the 5′- and 3′-RET signals
(Figure 1E, green and red arrows). The tumor did not harbor
either EGFR or, KRAS mutations or ALK rearrangement.
To screen for the RET fusion partner gene, we
prepared a cDNA library from the patient sample and
validated the fusion candidate using reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) across the fusion
breakpoint. The partner gene was confirmed by Sanger
sequencing (Figure  1F). According to PCR analysis,
genomic recombination occurred between the 553rd
nucleotide at KIAA1217 intron 11 and the 56th nucleotide
within RET exon 10. After fusion, a portion of RET exon
10 was excised through a more complex rearrangement
along with KIAA1217 intron 11, resulting in the novel
transcript involving KIAA1217 exon 11 fused to RET exon
11 (Figure 1F). This example illustrates after gene fusion
events to produce novel transcripts even if the fusions are
happened at the DNA level (Figure 1F). The KIAA1217RET fusion protein contains both coiled-coil and kinase
domains and can be predicted as an oncogenic driver gene
such as KIF5B-RET (Figure 2A).

Functional validation of KIAA1219-RET fusion
gene in vitro and in vivo
In comprehensive studies of RET, the RET gene is
alternatively spliced in its 3′ region and produces three
different isoforms, RET51, RET43, and RET9 that contain

(Figure 3C, white arrows) and expressed mesenchymal
markers, such as vimentin and snail in Matrigelembedded three- dimensional cell cultures (Figure 3D).
Similar results were observed in NIH3T3 cells (Figure 4A
and  4B). Especially, cells expressing the KIAA1217RET51 fusion protein formed significantly more colonies
than cells expressing the KIAA1217-RET9 fusion
protein (Figure 4B). To verify our results, we performed
a tumorigenicity assay in a nude mouse (Figure  4C).
All five nude mice injected with cells expressing the
KIAA1217-RET fusion protein developed a subcutaneous
tumor, with the tumor size larger than that observed in the
LacZ control (Figure 4C). Additionally, we also observed
activation of AKT and ERK in tumors (Figure 4D). Taken
together, these data suggest that KIAA1217-RET fusion
play a key role for oncogenesis in NSCLC.

51,  43, and 9 amino acids in their C-terminal region,
respectively [26, 27]. RET9 and RET51 have been well
studied, as these are the most common isoforms [26, 28],
and known to differentially induce biochemical and
biological responses [23, 26, 29]. However, the association
with RET isoforms and tumorigenic potentials in RET
fusion-positive cancer is not clearly known. To investigate
RET isoform expression patterns in RET fusion-positive
cancer, we screened mRNA expression levels by qRT-PCR
using cDNA samples obtained from RET fusion-positive
lung (Figure  2B and 2C) and thyroid (Supplementary
Figure  S1) cancer specimens. Gene-expression profiles
showed that RET51 was highly expressed in both tissues
relative to RET9. In the patient with the KIAA1217-RET
fusion, RET51  was expressed at much higher levels
relative to RET9 (Figure  2C, red circle). Our results
indicated that RET51 is primarily expressed in patients
having RET fusion-positive tumors.
Comprehensive studies of RET describe that RET
produces at least two isoforms by alternative splicing
that have different C-terminal amino acids [30]. RET
isoforms displayed distinct gene-expression patterns
and promoted different levels of cell differentiation and
activation of downstream signals in tumors [23, 26]. To
test the tumorigenic potential of KIAA1217-RET [both the
longer (RET51) and shorter (RET9) RET isoforms], we
generated the KIAA1217-RET51 and KIAA1217-RET9
fusion constructs and established them in BEAS-2B and
NIH3T3  cell lines. Cells harboring KIAA1217-RET51
or KIAA1217-RET9 expressed the chimeric protein with
a molecular weight of 135 kDa (the longer KIAA1217RET51) or 130 kDa (the shorter KIAA1217-RET9) and
induced ligand-independent phosphorylation (Figure 2D).
As described in Figure  1D, KIAA1217-RET51 and
KIAA1217-RET9 fusion proteins were mainly localized
in cytoplasmic regions but partially expressed in plasma
membranes (Figure  2E). This is because the 5′ fusion
partner KIAA1217 is mainly localized in cytoplasm,
leading to localization of the RET fusion proteins in
cytoplasm.
RET fusion proteins, such as CCDC6-RET and
KIF5B-RET, lead to anchorage-independent cell growth
and formation of multiple transformed foci [17]. To
validate tumorigenic potential of a KIAA1217-RET
fusion, we tested cell growth and tumor-forming ability
in vitro. Cells expressing the KIAA1217-RET51 or
KIAA1217-RET9 fusion protein showed increases in cell
proliferation and anchorage-independent growth relative
to the LacZ control in BEAS-2B cells (Figure  3A and
3C). Simultaneously, the expression of the KIAA1217RET fusion protein led to activation of RET downstream
signaling molecules, including STAT3, AKT and Erk
(Figure  3B). Consequently, KIAA1217-RET fusion
led to the increase in tumor cell invasion (Figure  3E).
Interestingly, some cells expressing the KIAA1217-RET51
fusion protein showed invasive finger-like protrusions

Effect of the RET inhibitor vandetanib on cells
expressing KIAA1217-RET
RET can be effectively inhibited by several smallmolecule tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Currently,
two TKIs, the vascular endothelial growth-factor
receptor 2 (VEGFR2)- and epidermal growth-factor
receptor (EGFR)-inhibitor vandetanib, and the METand VEGFR2-inhibitor cabozantinib, are approved by
the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment
of locally advanced and metastatic medullary thyroid
cancer [9, 13, 21]. Clinical studies in unselected NSCLCpatient populations conducted with RET TKIs did not
demonstrate particular survival benefits; however, case
reports described promising therapeutic responses to both
vandetanib and cabozantinib in patients with RET-fusionpositive lung adenocarcinomas [13,  31,  32]. Therefore,
we used a cell-viability assay to investigate the effect
of RET-TKIs, such as vandetanib, cabozantinib, and
ponatinib, on cells expressing KIAA1217-RET-fusion
proteins in order to determine whether the KIAA1217RET fusion could become a novel target of RET
inhibitors. Our results showed that cell proliferation rates
were reduced by vandetanib treatment of KIAA1217RET-transformed BEAS-2B cells relative to parental
cells (KIAA1217-RET9, IC50  =  0.34  μM; parental
IC50 = 0.67 μM, Supplementary Figure S2A). Additionally,
we observed that vandetanib treatment induced dosedependent inhibition of ERK phosphorylation, but not
AKT, in cells expressing the KIAA1217-RET fusion
proteins (Figure  5A, right). Ponatinib also inhibited
the growth of cells expressing KIAA1217-RET fusion
proteins with similar potency, while cabozantinib did not
show considerable effective responses (Supplementary
Figure S3). The invasive potential following vandetanib
treatment of cells expressing KIAA1217-RET fusion
proteins was analyzed using three-dimensional Matrigeland transwell-invasion assays (Figure  5B and 5C). As
expected, vandetanib treatment reduced cell growth

CCDC6, TRIM33, NCOA4, and CUX1) [7]. All of
these genes are located on chromosome 10, except for
TRIM33 and CUX1 (Figure  6). This study is the first
report of a novel KIAA1217-RET fusion gene in NSCLC.
The KIAA1217 gene is also located on the short arm
of chromosome 10 (10p12.2 locus), similar to KIF5B
(10p11.22), which is the most common RET partner gene
in NSCLC [33], and fused with RET by chromosomal
rearrangements.
KIAA1217 is a novel RET partner gene in lung
cancer and contains two CCDs that could promote ligandindependent dimerization in the RET fusion protein [34].
Previous researches reported that CCDs in fusion partners
associated with tyrosine-kinase fusion proteins can induce
an aberrant activation of the kinase domain through ligandindependent dimerization, as observed in ALK-fusion
proteins [9,  11,  19,  35–38]. Additionally, the BioGPSbased mRNA-expression profile showed that KIAA1217

that 0.5 µM vandetanib treatment resulted in a significant
accumulation of G1 phase cells expressing the KIAA1217RET fusion protein (Supplementary Figure  S4). The
percentage of cells expressing KIAA1217-RET51
(36.59%) or KIAA1217-RET9 (36.78%) in G1 phase
following treatment with 0.5  μM vandetanib markedly
increased as compared to cells expressing LacZ (31.62%).
These data support that the KIAA1217-RET fusion is a
novel oncogenic-driver gene and may be a potential target
of vandetanib to prevent tumor progression in NSCLC.

Discussion
RET fusion genes in lung adenocarcinomas
appear predominantly following intrachromosomal
rearrangement. In a previous report, we detected 15
RET fusion transcripts in cells taken from a lung cancer
patient and confirmed five RET fusion partners (KIF5B,

The results of this report are summarized in Figure 6,
illustrating the differences in the RET-fusion partner genes
involving KIAA1217. This study provided experimental
evidence supporting the use of vandetanib and promoting
KIAA1217-RET as a novel target for personalized cancer
therapy. The results presented here allow for the expansion
of treatment options through detection of novel fusion
genes in unselected NSCLC patients.

is ubiquitously expressed across a variety of human tissues,
and that its promoter can lead to high transcriptional
activity. Given these findings, we suggest that the novel
KIAA1217-RET fusion generates an aberrant chimeric
protein and consequently gives rise to oncogenic potentials
for tumorigenicity. Here, we demonstrated these activities
through in vivo and in vitro assays using transformed
BEAS-2B and NIH3T3 cells (Figures 3 and 4).
To date, RET specific inhibitors have not been fully
validated in clinical trials and there is no established
therapy for RET fusion-positive patients [39,  40]. In
this study, our data indicated that cells expressing the
KIAA1217-RET fusion protein were susceptible to
vandetanib treatment, which decreased cell proliferation
via reduction of ERK phosphorylation (Figure  5A).
Although previous studies suggested that cabozantinib
treatment exhibited greater inhibitory activity relative to
vandetanib treatment in cells harboring the RET/papillary
thyroid carcinoma (PTC) fusion gene, which is also known
as CCDC6-RET, [41, 42] and preliminary data from Drilon
et al. [13] revealed partial responses to cabozantinib
treatment in a prospective phase II trial involving patients
with RET-fusion-positive NSCLC, cabozantinib appears
to be an ineffective agent for cells expressing KIAA1217RET fusion proteins (Supplementary Figure  S4). This
is likely due to TKI treatment of RET positive cancer
exhibiting partial and different responses against aberrant
forms of RET according to its fusion partners [13, 41].
Alternative splicing of RET results in two main
isoforms, RET9 and RET51, which differ in their
C-terminal regions. Previous studies reported that RET51
and RET9 are both expressed in most tissues [43] and that
RET9 is frequently expressed at higher levels relative to
RET51 in human pheochromocytomas [26]. However,
here, we observed that RET51 is the more frequently
expressed form relative to RET9 in most RET fusionpositive samples. This phenomenon is thought to occur
since this study is performed in RET fusion-positive
patient group in NSCLC and it might mean that RET
fusion partners in NSCLC preferably contains the longer
transcript since it is more aggressive and evolutionarily
selected during cancer progression. We also showed that
the RET51 isoform of KIAA1217 fusion exhibited a more
aggressive phenotype and invasive potential along with
less sensitivity to vandetanib [9]. This is likely due to
RET51 having an additional phosphorylation site (Y1096),
which is a key docking site that binds to SH2-domaincontaining proteins, including growth factor receptorbound protein 2 (GRB2), which leads to the recruitment
of additional adaptors (GRB2-associated binding protein
1 or 2). This stimulation of multiple signaling pathways
promotes downregulation of RET51 [6, 23].
Here, we identified a novel KIAA1217-RET-fusion
gene, described its oncogenic function and pro-invasive
abilities, and demonstrated differences in vandetanib
sensitivity between the two resulting RET isoforms.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient, cell lines, and reagents
The patient was a 51-year-old Korean woman with
a non-smoking history who underwent a lobectomy due
to an occurrence of an irregular mass on the right-lower
lobe. The mass was confined to the lung parenchyma, did
not involve the visceral pleura, and no metastasis was
found in 27  lymph nodes. After 4  years of follow-up,
computed tomography scans did not reveal any evidence
of recurrence or metastasis in the patient without adjuvant
treatment. This study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of the Samsung Medical Center. The
bronchoepithelial cell line BEAS-2B (human bronchial
epithelium) was obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC CRL-9609; Manassas, VA, USA), and
NIH3T3  cells and 293FT cells were obtained from the
Korean Cell Line Bank (Seoul, Korea). The cells were
cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM;
JBI, Daegu, Korea) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA),
100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin
(Life Technologies). Vandetanib, cabozantinib, and
ponatinib were obtained from Selleck Pharmaceutical
(Houston, TX, USA). Ten RET-fusion-confirmed lung
adenocarcinomas [7] and 12 thyroid-cancer tissues were
collected from the Department of Pathology, Samsung
Medical Center (Seoul, Korea) for investigation of RETisoform expression patterns. All of the cell lines used were
authenticated via short tandem-repeat profiling before
beginning a new series of experiments and were kept in
culture for < 3 months.

RET immunohistochemistry and FISH
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections
were incubated in a solution of 0.3% H2O2 for 15 min to
inhibit endogenous peroxidase activity. The sections were
then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary
antibody solutions: RET antibody (ab134100; Abcam,
Cambridge, UK; 1:200 dilution). The EnVision Systems
for rabbit antibodies (K4003; DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark)
were applied according to manufacturer instructions.
Slides were stained with liquid diaminobenzidine
tetrahydrochloride, a high-sensitivity substrate-chromogen
system (K3468; DAKO). RET FISH tests were performed

on FFPE tumor tissues using ZytoLight SPEC RET Dual
Color Break Apart Probes according to manufacturer
instructions (ZytoVision, Bremerhaven, Germany). The
SPEC RET Dual Color Break Apart Probe is a mixture
of two direct-labeled probes hybridizing to the 10q11.21
band. The orange fluorochrome direct-labeled probe
hybridizes proximal to the RET gene and the green
fluorochrome direct-labeled probe hybridizes distal to
the gene. Signals for each locus-specific FISH probe
were assessed under an Olympus BX51TRF microscope
(Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a triple-pass filter
(4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole/Green/Orange; Vysis,
Downers Grove, IL, USA).

RET51 endR, 5′-ACTATCAAACGTGTCCATTAA
TTTTG-3′. For the KIAA1217-RET51 fusion construct, the
KIAA1217 fragment was generated from the KIAA1217RET9 construct and used as the template with the following
primer sets: Forward, KIAA1217 F; Reverse, RET 3092R,
5′-TCGTCATAAATCA GGGAGTCAGAT-3′. The second
overlapping PCR was performed with the KIAA1217 F
and RET51 endR primers. The full-length KIAA1217-RET
PCR products were ligated into the gateway entry vector
pCR8/GW/TOPO (Invitrogen, Life Technologies) and then
transferred into the pLenti6.3/V5-DEST gateway vector
(Invitrogen, Life Technologies) according to manufacturer
instructions.

cDNA library for the KIAA1217-RET fusion

Western blots

Total mRNA was extracted from the tumor tissue
using an RNeasy FFPE Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)
according to manufacturer instructions. To obtain a
cDNA library to screen fusion transcripts involving RET
as a fusion partner, a double-stranded cDNA fragment
corresponding to the conjoined region of the KIAA1217–
RET-fusion transcript was amplified by SMARTer 5′
rapid amplification of cDNA ends cDNA Amplification
Kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA,
USA). The PCR products were then cloned into a pCR4TOPO vector using the TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) for DNA sequencing. The cDNA
sequence of the novel KIAA1217-RET-fusion gene has
been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology
Information database under accession numbers
NM_001282767.1, NM_020975.4, and NM_020630.4.

The cell lysates from cells or tissues expressing
LacZ, EML4-ALK (GenBank: AB663645.1), KIAA1217RET51, or KIAA1217-RET9  were prepared with
a modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer
(50  mM Tris-HCl, 150  mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, and
0.25% sodium deoxycholate) plus a protease-inhibitor
cocktail (GenDepot, Katy, TX, USA). The lysates were
centrifuged at 15,000 g for 30 min at 4°C, diluted with
4X sample buffer, and boiled for 10  min. The samples
were separated on 8–10% sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and transferred
to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon
P; EMD Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). Blots were
blocked using 5% skim milk (BD Difco; BD Biosciences,
East Rutherford, NJ, USA) and incubated the following
antibodies at 4ºC overnight; Phosphor-RET(Tyr905,
#3221), STAT3(Tyr706, #9145), AKT(Ser473, #4060),
ERK(Thr202/Tyr204, #4370) antibodies and totalRET(#3223), STAT3(#4904), AKT(#2920), ERK(#9102),
vimentin, E-cadherin, and snail (Epithelial-Mesenchymal
Transition (EMT) Antibody Sampler Kit, #9782)
antibodies (Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA,
USA), or α-tubulin(#8035) or GAPDH(#25778) antibodies
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA).
Blots were washed and incubated with the secondary
antibodies and detected using a chemiluminescent
horseradish peroxidase substrate (EMD Millipore). All
western-blot images are representative of at least three
independent experiments.

Cloning full-length KIAA1217-RET51 and
KIAA1217-RET9 cDNA
For the KIAA1217-RET9 construct, cDNA was
generated by amplifying two separate overlapping
KIAA1217 and RET fragments that were generated
by overlap-extension PCR. For the first PCR, the
KIAA1217 fragment was amplified with the following
primer sets from MCF10A: Forward, KIAA1217
F,
5′-CCAGAGAGCGAGGAGCTTT-3′;
Reverse,
KIAA1217 R (including breakpoints), 5′-GTCGCACAGT
GGATCTTTCAGGGTAG CTACAGCCTC-3′. The RET9
fragment was generated from pDORN-RET (addgene
#23906) with the following primer sets: Forward,
RET51 F(including breakpoints), 5′-GTAGCTACCCTGAA
AGATCCACTGTGCGACGAGCT-3′; Reverse, RET9
endR, 5′-GAATCTAGTAAATGCATGG GAAATT-3′. The
second PCR was performed using a mixture of the first PCR
products with the KAA1217 F and RET9 endR primers.
The PCR for the RET51 fragment was performed using the
cDNA from the tumor specimen harboring the KIAA1217RET fusion with the following primer sets: Forward,
RET 3063F, 5′-CACTCCATCTGACTCCCTGATT-3′;

Immunofluorescence
Immunofluorescence was performed using the
following process. Glass coverslips were coated with
10 µg/mL collagen (#354236; BD Biosciences), and cells
expressing the indicated gene or an empty vector were
seeded on pre-coated coverslips. After 24 h, cells were
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with
0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
Cells were incubated with 5% FBS in PBS for 1 h and
36111

Oncotarget

then incubated at 4°C with anti-RET antibody (#3223,
Cell Signaling Technology). After overnight incubation,
cells were incubated with Alexa-fluor 488  rabbit antigoat secondary antibody (Molecular Probes; Life
Technologies), washed three times with PBS, and mounted
in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories,
Peterborough, UK). The images were taken with a Zeiss
LSM 750 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen,
Germany).

RET9 were cultured in Matrigel. The bottom layer of each
well was coated with 30 µL of Matrigel and allowed to
gel by incubating for 30 min at 37ºC. Then, 10,000 cells
resuspended in 150 µL of Matrigel were loaded onto
the bottom layer of each well. Medium with 10% FBS
was then overlaid onto the gel and replaced every other
day. The images of transformed foci were obtained after
culturing for 7  days. For the soft agar assay, the base
layer of each well consisted of 1.5 mL of medium with
a final concentration of 0.5% Noble agar (BD Sciences).
After bottom agar solidification, 1.5 mL of 0.35% agar
containing NIH3T3  cells (20,000) was seeded on the
bottom agar layer and incubated for 21 days. Medium was
changed every 4 days for 3 weeks. Colonies were fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde and then stained with 0.05%
crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and
representative images were taken by a phase-contrast
microscope (Olympus CKX41) using i-Solution Lite
image analysis software (Image & Microscope Tech.).
Statistical significance was analyzed by the GraphPad
Prism software (v5.01; GraphPad Software, Inc.).

Cell proliferation (viability) assay
Cell proliferation rates were measured with an EZCytox cell viability assay kit (Daeil Lab Service, Seoul,
Korea) according to manufacturer instructions. BEAS-2B
(2 × 103) or NIH3T3 cells (1 × 103) expressing the indicated
gene or an empty vector were seeded into 96-well plates.
On the indicated day, 10  µL of EZ-Cytox reagent was
added to each well and incubated for 2  h at 37ºC. The
absorbance was measured at 450  nm (foreground) and
650 nm (background) using a spectrophotometer. IC50
values were calculated using GraphPad Prism 5 (v5.01;
GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).

Xenograft tumor-formation assay

Relative quantitation of RET51 or RET9 using
real-time PCR

All animal experiments were approved by the
Institutional Review Board of Samsung Medical Center.
Cells (5  ×  106) were resuspended in PBS (pH 7.4) and
mixed with an equal volume of high-concentration
Matrigel. The mixture was subcutaneously injected into
the right dorsal flank of 6-week-old male nude mice
(Orient Bio, Gyeonggi-Do, Korea). Mice were monitored
three times weekly until tumor size reached approximately
2  ×  2  cm. Using electronic calipers, the greatest
longitudinal diameter (length) and the greatest transverse
diameter (width) were measured, and tumor volume was
calculated using the modified ellipsoidal formula [tumor
volume = 1/2 (length × width2)]. Mice were then sacrificed
and photographed on day 23. Statistical significance
was analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (v5.01;
GraphPad Software, Inc.).

For all tissue samples, total cellular RNA was
extracted from FFPE tissue with RNeasy FFPE Kit
(Qiagen) according to manufacturer instructions. The RET
transcripts were amplified by real-time PCR using RET
specific variant-51 or variant-9 primers; RET 51 forward,
5′- ACGAGAGCTGATGGCACTAA-3′; RET 51 reverse,
5′-TGAGGGTGAAAGCATCCAGT-3′; RET 9 forward,
5′-CCGCTGGTGGACTGTAATAATG-3′; RET9 reverse,
5′-CTAGTAAATGCATGGGAAATTCTAC-3′. Standard
curves were obtained by plotting crossing threshold (Ct)
values using absolute quantitative real-time PCR (qRTPCR) for serially diluted plasmid DNA containing RET 51
or RET 9 over a 105-fold range. To correct the differences
in RET transcript amplification efficiency using the
different primers, constant-amplification efficiency was
calculated from the slope on the basis of ∆∆Ct values using
assumptions of log-linear analysis. Relative expression
levels of RET 51 were normalized using the constantamplification efficiency of RET 9. Then, the relative RET9
and RET51 levels were calculated using the following
equation: RET51 = RET × {RET51 × (RET9+RET51)},
RET9 = RET × {RET9 × (RET9+RET51)}.

Invasion assay
Cellular invasion ability was evaluated by using
24-well transwell chambers (Corning Costar #3422;
Corning Life Sciences, Durham, NC, USA) with 8 µm
polycarbonate membrane filters. Upper chambers
contained 20 μL of 1 mg/mL Matrigel in the center of each
well and were allowed to spread over the entire surface of
the membrane, which was incubated for 2–3 h to allow
Matrigel solidification. Cells were incubated in serumfree media for 4 h, harvested, and loaded at 1 × 105 cells/
well into upper chambers that had been coated with
Matrigel and incubated with or without 2% FBS/DMEM
plus 0.5 μM vandetanib. The lower chambers were filled
with 10% FBS/DMEM. After an 18-h incubation, the

non-migrating cells in the upper chamber were removed
with cotton swabs. The migrating cells remaining on the
bottom portion of the membranes were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
The membrane was mounted and images were taken by the
Aperio ScanScope XT slide scanner (Aperio Technologies,
Inc., Vista, CA, USA) at 10 × magnification.
