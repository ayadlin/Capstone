ABSTRACT
Studies focused on the killing of activated B-RAF melanoma cells by the histone
deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor AR42. Compared to other tumor cell lines, PDX melanoma
isolates were significantly more sensitive to AR42-induced killing. AR42 and the
multi-kinase inhibitor pazopanib interacted to activate: an eIF2α–Beclin1 pathway
causing autophagosome formation; an eIF2α–DR4/DR5/CD95 pathway; and an eIF2αdependent reduction in the expression of c-FLIP-s, MCL-1 and BCL-XL. AR42 did not
alter basal chaperone activity but increased the ability of pazopanib to inhibit HSP90,
HSP70 and GRP78. AR42 and pazopanib caused HSP90/HSP70 dissociation from RAF-1
and B-RAF that resulted in reduced ‘RAF’ expression. The drug combination activated
a DNA-damage-ATM-AMPK pathway that was associated with: NFκB activation;
reduced mTOR S2448 and ULK-1 S757 phosphorylation; and increased ULK-1 S317
and ATG13 S318 phosphorylation. Knock down of PERK, eIF2α, Beclin1, ATG5 or
AMPKα, or expression of IκB S32A S36A, ca-mTOR or TRX, reduced cell killing. AR42,
via lysosomal degradation, reduced the protein expression of HDACs 2/5/6/10/11.
In vivo, a 3-day exposure of dabrafenib/trametinib resistant melanoma cells to the
AR42 pazopanib combination reduced tumor growth and enhanced survival from ~25
to ~40 days. Tumor cells that had adapted through therapy exhibited elevated HGF
expression and the c-MET inhibitor crizotinib enhanced AR42 pazopanib lethality in
this evolved drug-resistant population.

INTRODUCTION

to be potent inhibitors of chaperone ATPase activities.
ATPase inhibition was associated with conformational
changes in the ATP binding NH2-termini of the chaperone
proteins and with the abilities of these chaperones to
associate and co-localize with other chaperones and client
proteins [7, 8]. It has also been reported that acetylation
can also alter the activity of chaperones, generally thought
to be an inhibitory effect, with the regulatory acetylation
of HSP90 controlled by HDAC6 [9, 10]. Recently we
determined that that phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors
such as sildenafil (Viagra®), via PKG signaling, did not
significantly alter basal chaperone ATPase activities

Prior studies have demonstrated that histone
deacetylase inhibitors such as valproate, vorinostat and AR42
enhance the cytotoxic potential of multi-kinase inhibitors
such as sorafenib, regorafenib and pazopanib [1–6]. Several
clinical trials using HDAC inhibitors, including AR42,
in combination with multi-kinase inhibitors are presently
open at VCU Massey Cancer Center (NCT02349867;
NCT01075113; NCT02795819; NCT01817751).
Sorafenib and pazopanib, in addition to being
inhibitors of protein kinases, were also recently discovered

but instead facilitated sorafenib and pazopanib to cause
further inhibition of chaperone ATPase activities and a
more rapid NH2-terminus conformational change [11]. The
changes in chaperone ATPase activity and conformation
after [sorafenib + sildenafil] and [pazopanib + sildenafil]
exposure was also reflected in the phosphorylation/activity
of key chaperoned proteins [7, 8, 11]. Whether chaperone
acetylation also facilitates the chaperone inhibitory effects
of a multi-kinase inhibitor is unknown.
There are several classes of histone deacetylase
inhibitors: class I (HDACs 1, 2, 3 and 8); class II
(HDACs 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10); class IV (HDAC11). The
HDAC inhibitor AR42 is an orally bioavailable, phenylbutyrate-based small molecule, and is a broad spectrum
inhibitor of class I and class II histone deacetylase
(HDAC) enzymes. HDAC inhibitors are a class of anticancer agents that suppress tumor cell growth via a broad
spectrum of mechanisms including the ability to induce
growth arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis in cancer cells
[12–17]. AR42 has been studied in several laboratorybased cancer models including prostate, hepatocellular,
ovarian, lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell leukemia and
acute myelogenous leukemia [15, 18]. Safety studies to
assess potential adverse effects of AR42 on the central
nervous system, the cardiovascular system, and the
respiratory system have been completed and no adverse
side effects were observed [18]. Two clinical studies have
been conducted with AR42. To date, a total of 57 patients
have been treated with AR42 in these 2 clinical trials. The
RP2D of AR42 for solid tumor patients was 60 mg QD
Monday/Wednesday/Friday for three weeks followed by
a vacation week. As a single agent, the HDAC inhibitor
panobinostat did no display anti-melanoma activity in
patients [19].
Because: a) pazopanib is a potent chaperone
inhibitor; b) the [pazopanib + AR42] drug combination
has pre-clinical and clinical activity in sarcoma and renal
carcinoma; and c) that B-RAF and RAF-1 rely on the
chaperones HSP90 and HSP70 to maintain their active
conformations, we performed studies in multiple PDX
models of human melanoma, including vemurafenib
resistant isolates, where cells expressed various mutated
active forms of B-RAF. Our present pre-clinical findings
argue that AR42 may have single agent activity against
mutant B-RAF melanoma, and that AR42 facilitates tumor
cell killing by the multi-kinase inhibitor pazopanib in vitro
and in vivo.

combination of [pazopanib + AR42] was also more effective
at killing melanoma cells than sarcoma and kidney cancer
cells (Figure 1C). The standard of care treatment for mutant
B-RAF melanoma is the combination of the MEK1/2/5
inhibitor trametinib and the mutant B-RAF specific
inhibitor dabrafenib. In PDX models of mutant B-RAF
melanoma AR42 and pazopanib, as single agents, and in
combination were more effective at killing the melanoma
cells than the combination of trametinib/dabrafenib at their
individual 100% C max plasma concentrations (Figure 1D).
The TPF-12-293 isolate is vemurafenib resistant and in
these cells both AR42 and [pazopanib + AR42] caused high
levels of cell killing whereas treatment with trametinib/
dabrafenib did not significantly enhance cell death. Similar
cell killing data to that in human melanoma cells was
obtained in mouse melanoma cells with no known specific
driving oncogene addiction, ovarian cancer cells, NSCLC
cells, squamous head & neck cancer cells, triple negative
breast cancer cells and bladder cancer cells (Supplementary
Figure 1A–1F). Similar cell killing data to that obtained
using AR42 alone or in combination with pazopanib in
melanoma and ovarian cancer cells were also obtained
using the generic pan-HDAC inhibitor sodium valproate
(Supplementary Figure 2).
In parallel to the initial studies in Figure 1, we
generated trametinib/dabrafenib resistant MEL28 cells
(MEL28-R). AR42, pazopanib and the drug combination
more effectively killed MEL28-R cells than it did wild
type parental cells (Figure 2A). As AR42 was enhancing
the anti-cancer properties of a multi-kinase inhibitor, we
determined whether it could also enhance trametinib/
dabrafenib-induced killing; AR42 and trametinib/
dabrafenib interacted in a greater than additive fashion
to kill multiple PDX melanoma isolates (Figure 2B).
Furthermore, low concentrations of AR42 restored the
ability of trametinib/dabrafenib to kill MEL28-R cells
(Figure 2C). Collectively, our data demonstrate that
pazopanib lethality in a wide range of tumor cell types
can be enhanced by HDAC inhibitors.
In TPF-12-293 vemurafenib resistant cells, using
unbiased screening we discovered that treatment with
[pazopanib + AR42] increased the expression of Beclin1
and decreased the expression of c-FLIP-s, MCL-1,
BCL-XL, SOD2 and TRX (Figure 3A). In vitro, within
6 h, [pazopanib + AR42] exposure increased the
phosphorylation of ATG13 S318, ULK1 S317, AMPK
T172, ATM S1981, eIF2α S51, p65 NFκB S536; and
decreased the phosphorylation of ULK1 S757, mTOR
S2448, mTOR S2481, AKT T308, ERK1/2, STAT3
Y705, STAT5 Y703, as well as the phosphorylation of the
growth factor receptors ERBB1, ERBB2 and PDGFRβ
(Figure  3A). Similar data were obtained in TPF-08196 cells (Supplementary Figure 3). We next performed
additional unbiased screening studies to determine the
survival/death -regulatory pathways by which [pazopanib
+ AR42] killed melanoma cells. Expression of c-FLIP-s

and BCL-XL reduced cell killing whereas expression of
dominant negative caspase 9 was marginally effective
(Figure 3B). Knock down of the death receptor CD95 and to
a greater extent the adaptor protein FADD suppressed cell
killing. Knock down of [BAX+BAK], [NOXA+PUMA],
AIF, Beclin1, ATG5, PERK or eIF2α reduced cell killing.
Similar data were obtained in TPF-12-510 and MEL28-R
isolates (Supplementary Figure 4A and 4B).
In addition to BAX, BAK, NOXA and PUMA,
knock down of the toxic BH3 domain proteins BIM, BAD
or BID also suppressed killing by [pazopanib + AR42]
(Figure 4A). Combined drug exposure increased
the total expression of BIM and caused BAD S112
dephosphorylation without altering total ERK2 levels
(Figure 4B). In Figure 3B we noted that knock down of
FADD was more protective than knock down of CD95
at preventing cell killing. Knock down of the death
receptors DR4 or DR5 also partially, but significantly,
reduced [pazopanib + AR42] killing (Figure 4C). Based
on the data showing reduced STAT3, ERK1/2, AKT
and mTOR activity, we manipulated cell signaling
pathway function. Activation of STAT3, AKT, MEK1 or
mTOR suppressed the lethality of [pazopanib + AR42]
(Figure  4D). Expression of dominant negative IκB
S32A S36A suppressed drug combination toxicity. Thus,
based on our collective findings, [pazopanib + AR42]

combination lethality proceeds through death receptor
signaling (CD95, DR4, DR5); autophagy (AMPK, mTOR,
ULK1, ATG13); and ER stress signaling (PERK, eIF2α)
that converges on the mitochondrion and that downstream
of the mitochondrion cell killing is mediated by AIF and
not caspase 9. i.e. we are inducing necroptosis.
It has been shown by many groups that HDAC
inhibitors can rapidly activate a DNA damage response,
i.e. HDAC inhibitors can cause activation of the
ataxia telangiectasia mutated protein (ATM) [21, 22].
[Pazopanib + AR42] exposure activated ATM within
6 h that, in agreement with a DNA damage signal, was
associated with increased γH2AX phosphorylation
(Figure 5A). [Pazopanib + AR42]-induced threonine
172 phosphorylation of the AMPK alpha subunit was
ATM-dependent. Drug combination -induced regulatory
phosphorylation of RAPTOR and TSC2 required
ATM-AMPK signaling (Figure 5A and 5B). Knock
down of ATM or of AMPK prevented drug induced
phosphorylation of ULK1 S317 and ATG13 S318 and
drug-induced dephosphorylation of mTOR S2448, mTOR
S2481, AKT T308 and ULK1 S757 (Figure 5A–5C).
Thus the data in Figure 3B and Figure 5 argues that
DNA damage, through ATM-AMPK signaling, facilitates
toxic autophagosome formation. The drug combination
activated eIF2α, and knock down of eIF2α prevented the

drug-induced declines in MCL-1, BCL-XL and c-FLIP-s
expression and the increase in Beclin1 expression
(Figure 5D). Knock down of AMPK, ULK1, Beclin1 or
eIF2α suppressed the increase in toxic autophagosome
levels (Figure 5E). Knock down of AMPK, eIF2α or the
lysosomal protease cathepsin B reduced drug-induced cell
killing (Figure 5F). Thus, ER stress signaling, via eIF2α
and Beclin1, facilitates toxic autophagosome/autolysosome
formation and cathepsin B activation, and eIF2α signaling,
via reduction of c-FLIP-s, MCL-1 and BCL-XL levels,
facilitates death receptor signaling and mitochondrial
dysfunction.
It has been known for several decades that both
HSP90 and HSP70 chaperone B-RAF and RAF-1
and that removal of these chaperones during ‘RAF’
chromatographic protein purification results in rapid
RAF protein denaturation [23–26]. Prior studies have
demonstrated that pazopanib is an inhibitor of the
chaperones HSP90 and HSP70 that was associated with
a tertiary structural change in the NH2-termini of the
proteins [7, 11]. Using vemurafenib resistant TPF-12293 cells we re-confirmed that pazopanib could alter the
structure of chaperones in melanoma cells as judged by
reduced immuno-fluorescence at the NH2-termini but
not at their COOH termini (Supplementary Figure 5).

Notably for HSP90 and HSP70, AR42 treatment of the
cells enhanced the ability of pazopanib to occlude the
epitope at the NH2-termini of the chaperone proteins. In
agreement with this observation, although AR42 treatment
did not alter basal chaperone activities, in vivo treatment
of chaperones with the HDAC inhibitor facilitated the
ability of pazopanib to inhibit the HSP90 and HSP70
ATPase activities ex vivo (Figure 6A). Of greater interest,
the ability of AR42 to interact with pazopanib to suppress
chaperone ATPase activity was prevented by knock down
of ATM (Figure 6B). Pazopanib was also shown to be an
inhibitor of the GRP78 ATPase activity, an effect that was
enhanced by prior exposure of cells to AR42 (Figure 6C).
Treatment of melanoma cells with [pazopanib + AR42]
for one hour significantly reduced the amount of B-RAF
and RAF-1 that co-precipitated with HSP90 and HSP70
(Figure 6D). Furthermore, in agreement with reduced
‘RAF’ protein-chaperone association and greater ‘RAF’
denaturation, treatment of the melanoma cells for 6 h
with AR42 or with [pazopanib + AR42] reduced the total
protein levels of B-RAF and RAF-1 (Figure 6E).
AR42 is known to be a highly efficacious catalytic
inhibitor of HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC6, HDAC8
and HDAC10 (Figure 7A, upper). Individual knock down
of HDAC1/2/3/6/8/10 did not significantly alter basal

levels of cell viability and only knock down of HDAC6
modestly enhanced pazopanib lethality (data not shown).
Knock down of HDAC6 combined with knock down of
HDAC2 or of HDAC10 caused a significant high level
of killing when combined with pazopanib (Figure 7A,
lower). The HSP90-associated HDAC, HDAC6, has
been proposed to regulate autophagic flux, with protein
acetylation reducing the maturation of autophagosomes
into autolysosomes [27–30]. To test for a role of HDAC6
in our system, we over-expressed HDAC6, either using
a catalytically active wild type protein or a protein that
lacks activity in the two deacetylase catalytic activity sites.
In TPF-12-293 cells the absence of HDAC6 expression
or in the presence of dominant negative HDAC6, drug
combination exposure caused a significantly higher
induction of LC3-GFP punctae in cells (Figure 7B). Overexpression of wild type HDAC6 reduced the induction of
GFP+ punctae. Similar data were obtained in TPF-08-196
cells (Supplementary Figure 6). In the absence of HDAC6
expression the basal levels of p62 and LAMP2 were also
elevated; in the case of p62 the drug combination did not
further enhance its levels; in the case of LAMP2 the drug
combination did further increase its levels (Figure 7C).
Knock down of HDAC6 did not alter the ability of the
drug combination to elevate P-γH2AX levels arguing that
the drug combination effects were more likely proximal to
the autophagic apparatus than to ATM and DNA damage.

During these studies examining HDACs, we
surprisingly discovered that AR42 also rapidly reduced the
protein levels of HDAC2, HDAC5, HDAC6, HDAC10
and HDAC11 (Supplementary Figure 7A and 7B). Similar
data showing reduced HDAC levels were obtained using
valproate (Supplementary Figure  8A). Melanoma cells,
compared to other tumor cell types, expressed higher
protein levels of HDAC6 which may explain melanoma
sensitivity to HDAC inhibitors (Supplementary Figure 8B).
We next attempted to define the mechanisms by which
HDAC6 protein expression was being rapidly reduced.
Knock down of ATG5, an early essential inducer of
autophagosome formation, or knock down of Beclin1, an
intermediate essential inducer of autophagosome formation,
both prevented [pazopanib + AR42] treatment from
reducing HDAC6 expression (Figure 8A). Thus, HDAC6
is degraded through a process involving “autophagy.”
Treatment of melanoma cells with [pazopanib + AR42]
after 6 h increased the protein levels of LAMP2, LC3
and p62/SQSTM1 (Figure 8B). This effect was reduced
by knock down of AMPK, Beclin1 and to a lesser extent
by eIF2α. In contrast to a regulatory role for autophagy
in the levels of HDAC6 expression, the clinically relevant
inhibitor of E3 ligase activities, bortezomib (Velcade®),
did not modify the reduction in HDAC6 expression
(Figure 8C). In cells treated with [pazopanib + AR42],
at 10× magnification HDAC6 co-localized with LAMP2,

but not p62/SQSTM1, validating a lysosomal -dependent
degradation mechanism (Figure 8D).
As stated previously, HSP90 is an acetylated protein,
and HDAC6 has been proposed to de-acetylate HSP90.
Acetylation of HSP90 has been proposed to reduce the
chaperoning ability of HSP90. Knock down of HDAC6
elevated the basal levels of HSP90 acetylation and
prevented [pazopanib + AR42] from increasing HSP90
acetylation (Supplementary Figure 9A). Treatment of
cells with [pazopanib + AR42] significantly enhanced
HSP90 acetylation which correlated with reduced HDAC6
expression (Supplementary Figure 9B). Knock down of
AMPK, which prevents both autophagosome/autolysosome
formation and cell killing, prevented the increase in
HSP90 acetylation and prevented the down-regulation of
HDAC6 (Supplementary Figure 9C). At 60× magnification,
[pazopanib + AR42] exposure increased the levels of
staining for LAMP2 and for ATG13 S318 that both
appeared to be contained in small vesicles (Supplementary
Figure 9D). However, LAMP2 and P-ATG13 S318 did not

co-localize. Together with the data in Figure 8D, this argues
that HDAC6 after combined drug exposure is localized in
autolysosomes.
Dysregulation of HDAC6 has also been linked to
elevated production of reactive oxygen species and our
prior data had shown the drug combination reduced TRX
and SOD2 levels. Knock down of HDAC6 enhanced the
abilities of our drug combination treatment to increase
ROS levels (Figure 9A). Over-expression of TRX or
SOD2 protected cells from drug combination lethality
(data not shown). Over-expression of HDAC6 reduced
the ability of [pazopanib + AR42] to increase ROS levels.
Expression of dominant negative HDAC6 enhanced the
ability of [pazopanib + AR42] to increase ROS levels.
Knock down of HDAC6 was previously shown to
enhance the ability of [pazopanib + AR42] to increase
LAMP2 levels, and similarly, expression of dominant
negative HDAC6 enhanced drug-induced LAMP2 levels
(Figure 9B). Expression of wild type HDAC6 lowered
the basal levels of LAMP2 and significantly reduced the

accumulation of LAMP2 after drug exposure. Similar
confirmatory data were also obtained when we examined
changes in p62/SQSMT1 expression. The alterations
observed in autophagosome formation were also reflected
in the ability of [pazopanib + AR42] to kill the melanoma
cells, with expression of wild type HDAC6 reducing
killing and expression of dominant negative HDAC6
promoting death (Figure 9C).
We next performed animal studies to validate the
in vitro findings. Initial studies used MEL28 cells made
resistant to trametinib/dabrafenib by prolonged culture
in 2 µM trametinib/2 µM dabrafenib. One million tumor
cells were implanted into the rear flanks of athymic mice
and seven days later when the mean tumor volume was
9.0 +/– 0.8 mm3, animals were treated with drugs for three
days. Vehicle control treated tumors grew rapidly and
within 20 days of implantation tumor volumes had begun to
reach the sacrifice cut-off point of 250 mm3 (the equivalent
of a 0.75 kg tumor in a 60 kg human) (Figure 10A and 10B).
The mean time to death for vehicle treated animals was
25.4 +/– 0.7 days. Trametinib/dabrafenib treated tumors

grew more slowly than control tumors with a mean animal
survival of 29.4 +/– 1.0 days, which however, when
also taking into account the three-day growth-arresting
drug exposure was not a statistically different survival
value from the control animal group. Animals exposed
to either AR42 or pazopanib had mean survival values
of 33.6 +/– 0.7 days and 33.0 +/– 0.6 days, respectively.
These increases in animal survival were significant
(p < 0.01). Animals exposed to pazopanib AR42 had a
mean survival of 40.2 +/– 0.6 days which was significantly
greater than the survival of animals treated only with AR42
or with pazopanib (p < 0.02). Thus, a combined three day
pazopanib plus two day AR42 treatment using clinically
proportional drug doses had increased animal survival from
25.4 days to 40.2 days (~14–15 days), a 58% increase.
Using tumors isolated at the time of sacrifice,
25–40 days after drug exposure, we obtained 4 micron
sections and performed immuno-histochemistry analyses
to determine the expression of biomarkers within the
tumor (Figure 10C–10E). When compared to vehicle
control treated tumors, tumors previously exposed to

AR42 or to [pazopanib + AR42] exhibited higher levels
of: macrophages; neutrophils; and natural killer cells
(Figure 10C–10E). Additional blown up images of the
data in Figure 10C–10E are provided in Supplementary
Figures 10–19. After examining multiple tumor sections
from multiple tumors, it became evident that drug
exposure, particularly exposure to AR42 as a single
agent, had dramatically altered the cyto-architecture of
the tumors (Supplementary Figures 20–23). Prior AR42
treatment had caused the re-grown tumors to become less
dense with interstitial spaces between defined “clumps”
of tumor cells.
Using tumor material and mouse plasma isolated at
the time of animal sacrifice, approximately 25–40 days
after cessation of drug exposure, we next performed
antibody array multiplex analyses on tissue and plasma
to detect changes in protein phosphorylation and altered
mouse plasma levels of human growth factors and
cytokines. Plasma from animals exposed to AR42, and
generally though to a lesser extent [pazopanib + AR42],
had reduced levels of human soluble CD163, human
interferon alpha, interferon beta, interferon gamma

(not shown), IL-10, IL-12 family cytokines and the
metalloproteases MMP1-3 (Figure 11). That less sCD163
in the plasma was detected after the drug treatments
implies that macrophage activity had declined; future
studies will need to define the M1/M2 macrophage
phenotype found within the tumors. MMP1, MMP2 and
MMP3 are known to be essential proteases for both the
growth and metastatic spread of melanoma tumors [37].
In animals exposed to [pazopanib + AR42] the plasma
levels of IL-8 were increased, a finding similar to our prior
studies using [pemetrexed + sorafenib] and [ruxolitinib +
afatinib] [38, 39]. Both the AR42 and [pazopanib + AR42]
treatments selected for lower plasma levels of tumorderived human gp130 and of soluble IL-6RA (Figure 12A).
IL-6 in the plasma binds to soluble IL-6RA and this
complex has elevated agonist activity at activating tumor
cell surface IL-6RA, however, gp130 in the plasma binds
to the IL-6/sIL-6RA complex and quenches the ability of
the protein complex to act as an agonist [40]. The normal
plasma concentration range in a healthy human for gp130
is 200–400 ng/ml and that of IL-6RA is 30–70 ng/ml. Our
data demonstrated that AR42 reduced gp130 levels by

~40% and those of IL-6RA by ~80% which collectively
argues that overall IL-6 paracrine/autocrine signaling may
be reduced in AR42 treated melanoma tumors.
In contrast to our data examining the
reduced expression of cytokines, both AR42 and
[pazopanib + AR42] exposure increased the plasma
levels of many growth factors including bFGF, HGF,
PDGF, G-CSF and prolactin, though not of IL-6 which
further validates our initial hypothesis over IL-6 signaling
(Figure 12B and 12C). The basal plasma levels of PDGF
were approximately 100-fold greater than those of the other
growth factors examined in our panel, and, comparing
the ordinate scale of panel B to the scaling in panel A
and panel C, we conclude that transient AR42 exposure
causes the further evolution of MEL28-R melanoma cells
that are very likely becoming addicted to the signaling
downstream of the PDGFRα/PDGFRβ/FGFR/c-MET/
prolactin receptors. In a manner reminiscent of IL-6, the
functionality of signaling via ERBB1 was also likely
reduced following drug exposure as both the levels of HBEGF and TGFα declined in drug treated plasma and the
levels of soluble ERBB1, that will sequester and inactivate
circulating HB-EGF and TGFα increased.

We then examined the phosphorylation and
expression of signal transduction regulatory proteins in
the tumors themselves. In agreement with reduced HBEGF and TGFα levels and increased soluble ERBB1,
the activity of ERBB1 was reduced in both AR42 and
[pazopanib  +  AR42] treated tumors (Figure 13A). In
contrast, the activity of PDGFRα and PDGFRβ were
both elevated after [pazopanib + AR42] exposure
which correlates with elevated plasma levels of PDGF.
Downstream of growth factor receptors the expression
level of the lipid phosphatase PTEN was reduced as was the
inhibitory phosphorylation at PTEN S380 (Figure 13B).
As the phosphorylation of PTEN was reduced to a greater
extent than its total protein level, our data argue that PTEN
activity, despite the reduction in total PTEN expression,
may be elevated in the drug exposed tumors. Nota bene:
in general phosphatases are known to be approximately
10-fold more catalytically active than kinases, thus a
small change in phosphatase activity will be magnified
on the regulation of its substrate. Downstream of PTEN
we discovered that AR42 had activated AKT ~1.7-fold
whereas in [pazopanib + AR42] treated tumors no AKT
activation was apparent (Figure 13C). Also downstream

of PTEN, the phosphorylation of mTOR S2448 was
enhanced in both AR42 and [pazopanib + AR42] treated
tumors. The MEL28-R cells initially implanted into the
mice were dabrafenib/trametinib resistant and in drug
exposed tumors our data argued that MEK1/2-ERK1/2p90rsk signaling was uncoupled. Prior [pazopanib + AR42]
exposure had no effect on p90rsk phosphorylation or on
MEK1/2 phosphorylation whereas it enhanced ERK1/2
phosphorylation. The prior drug treatments, in a manner
similar to that observed for mTOR and ERK1/2, modestly
enhanced the phosphorylation of JNK1/2, p38MAPK and
the substrate of p38MAPK, HSP27 by ~1.7-fold. The
phosphorylation of STAT3 at S727 was not altered by
drug exposure whereas the phosphorylation of STAT3
Y705 was elevated ~2.6-fold in drug combination treated
cells. The phosphorylation of NFκB S536 was enhanced
~1.5-fold in drug treated tumors and the phosphorylation
of IκB S32 S36 enhanced ~1.1-fold in drug treated cells,
together arguing for modestly enhanced NFκB activity in
drug treated cells.

Finally, as a standard of care drug in sarcoma and
renal carcinoma pazopanib is dosed daily and would thus
be likely to block any compensatory survival signaling
through PDGFRα/PDGFRβ/FGFR, but not through
c-MET or SRC-linked cytokine receptors. Hence, we
determined in MEL28-R cells isolated from tumors
previously treated with [pazopanib + AR42] whether
inhibition of c-MET could enhance cell killing. Post[pazopanib + AR42] MEL28-R cells were still sensitive
to being rapidly (12 h) killed by [pazopanib + AR42]
(Figure 13D). Neither sunitinb (an inhibitor of G-CSFR,
FLT3, KIT, PDGFR, VEGFR), dasatinib (an inhibitor of
BCR-ABL, SRC family, KIT, Ephrin-Rs) nor afatinib
(an inhibitor of ERBB1, ERBB2, ERBB4) enhanced the
lethality of [pazopanib + AR42]. In contrast, the relatively
specific c-MET and ALK inhibitor crizotinib significantly
enhanced [pazopanib + AR42] lethality. Downstream of
c-MET, the JAK1 and JAK2 specific inhibitor ruxolitinib
also enhanced [pazopanib + AR42] lethality. Thus, our
data, derived from multiplex assays and the observation

circumvent the development of drug resistance.

resistant cells, than did the standard of care combination
of trametinib/dabrafenib each at their established full C
max values. In an animal model system using trametinib/
dabrafenib resistant melanoma cells, AR42 as a single
agent could significantly retard melanoma tumor growth
and prolong animal survival. Exposure of trametinib/
dabrafenib resistant tumors to the [pazopanib + AR42]
combination for three days significantly reduced tumor
growth below baseline levels for two weeks and further
extended animal survival beyond that afforded by AR42
as a single agent.
The molecular mechanisms by which pazopanib
and AR42 interacted to cause tumor cell death were
complex, with cell death being mediated through multiple
overlapping and congruent mechanisms (Figure 14). The
drug combination: a) activated death receptor signaling
through caspase 8 causing mitochondrial dysfunction;
b) inhibited the functionality of multiple chaperones
through inhibition of their ATPase activities which
activated endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling that
facilitated both autophagosome formation and suppressed
the expression of protective proteins including c-FLIP-s,
MCL-1 and BCL-XL; c) caused a DNA damage response
which regulated AMPK-dependent mTOR inactivation

DISCUSSION
The present studies were initially conducted
to determine whether the drug combination of
[pazopanib + AR42], previously shown to kill sarcoma
and renal carcinoma cells and now the subject of a phase I
trial, could also kill melanoma cells expressing a mutated
active B-RAF protein. In the trial NCT02795819, 3 out of
4 renal carcinoma patients in the lowest dosing cohort have
exhibited one PR and two prolonged SDs (Poklepovic and
Dent, unpublished observations). Using multiple PDX
models of mutant B-RAF melanoma we determined that
AR42 in vitro was a more potent anti-melanoma drug than
was previously observed for the agent in sarcoma and
kidney cancer cells. The [pazopanib + AR42] combination
at ~40–50% of their individual C max values caused
significantly more in vitro melanoma cell killing, including
killing vemurafenib resistant and trametinib/dabrafenib

and induction of toxic autophagosomes as well as toxic
NFκB signaling; d) via ATM-AMPK signaling which
reduced expression of HDAC6 leading to sustained
HSP90 acetylation which will facilitate the ATPase
inhibitory effect of pazopanib. All of these mechanisms
converged to cause a profound level of mitochondrial
dysfunction, likely reducing cellular ATP levels, as killing
was mediated by the necroptotic actions of AIF rather
than the ATP-dependent mechanism through caspases 9
and 3. Our studies, in addition to PDX melanoma isolates,
also examined PDX head & neck carcinoma and ovarian
isolates; NSCLC cells; triple negative breast cancer cells;
and bladder cancer cells. In all of the tumor cell types
tested, AR42 treatment caused significant amounts of
tumor cell killing as a single agent and interacted with
pazopanib to further enhance killing.
There are a number of recognized mechanisms
by which mutant B-RAF melanoma cells evolve under
therapeutic pressure to become trametinib/dabrafenib
resistant. One evolutionary mechanism, that will bypass
the trametinib/dabrafenib drug combination, is the reactivation of ERK1/2 in a manner independent of RAFMEK signaling; another evolutionary pathway can be
through activation of ERBB1; and another by activating

the PI3K pathway, e.g. loss of PTEN. We found that
the [pazopanib  + AR42] combination killed trametinib/
dabrafenib -resistant MEL28 cells more effectively that it did
parental wild type MEL28 cells. The [pazopanib + AR42]
combination also caused high levels of killing in the
MEL24 line that expresses mutant B-RAF and lacks PTEN
expression as well as in the TPF-12-293 PDX isolate that
is vemurafenib resistant. Neither pazopanib nor AR42 are
direct inhibitors of the ERK1/2/PI3K/STAT3 pathways
and as individual agents neither drug caused a significant
decline in ERK1/2 or AKT or STAT3 phosphorylation,
whereas the combination of the drugs caused almost
complete inactivation of ERK1/2, AKT, STAT3, mTORC1
and mTORC2. Using molecular tools, re-activation of
either ERK1/2, AKT, STAT3 or mTOR strongly suppressed
drug combination killing. These findings argue that efficient
melanoma cell killing in our system requires dysregulation
of multiple survival signaling modules, such as ERK-BAD/
BIM and AMPK-mTOR-autophagy and ERK-STAT3MCL-1, shifting their activities/functions from maintaining
cell viability to permitting tumor cell death. The most
likely explanation why [pazopanib + AR42] has so many
pleiotropic toxic effects and inactivates so many cytoprotective pathways is that it inactivates HSP90 family,

HSP70 family and particularly the ER localized HSP70
family chaperone GRP78; chaperones essential to maintain
ERK1/2, AKT, STAT3 and mTOR activity and essential
to keep PERK-eIF2α signaling dormant. Collectively, this
data suggests that by disregarding the in vogue approach
of using highly specific kinase inhibitors for personalized
medicine approaches against a specific clonal tumor cell
type, e.g. the dabrafenib/trametinib combination against
mutant B-RAF, we have been able to out-fox both the
evolutionary survival responses of tumor cells as well as
being able to kill tumor cells carrying a wide variety of
upstream mutations that would predict for drug resistance
and a shorter overall patient survival.
Our data demonstrating that AR42, in addition to
being an HDAC inhibitor, can also rapidly reduce the
expression of HDACs 2/5/6/10/11 was unexpected. The
ability of AR42 to down-regulate HDAC6 protein levels
was similar to that exhibited by valproate. It is already
known that HDAC6 in complex with other proteins can
regulate the initial stages of autophagosome formation and
can facilitate the appropriate localization of ubiquinated
proteins for their degradation [27, 28, 30, 41–43]. And,
furthermore, that the AMPK can phosphorylate and

destabilize HDAC6, with its degradation occurring
through ubiquitination. Some of these analyses, however,
over-expressed HDAC proteins whereas our studies have
examined endogenous protein levels [44]. In our present
studies, although the AMPK was partially activated by
AR42, HDAC6 degradation was not blocked by the
E3 ligase inhibitor bortezomib. Instead, inhibition of
autophagosome formation by knocking down either
ATG5 or Beclin1 prevented the AR42-mediated reduction
in HDAC6 levels. In contrast to these findings, we also
found that the expression levels of LAMP2 and p62/
SQSMT1 were elevated in [pazopanib + AR42] treated
cells which argues lysosomal digestive functions are
reduced by the drug combination. Yet HDAC6 degradation
was lysosomal. HDAC10 is essential for autophagosome
– lysosome fusion as well as autolysosome maturation.
Collectively our data argues that in our drug-combination
system HDAC6 and HDAC10 play an essential role in
both the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes as
well as the maturation of autolysosomes. In cells lacking
HDAC6, [pazopanib + AR42] could not further increase
the levels of p62 but did so for LAMP2 arguing that
[pazopanib + AR42] through HDAC6-dependent and

HDAC6-independent mechanisms regulates autolysosome
maturation i.e. a requirement for HDAC10. HDAC6
degradation was co-localized with LAMP2 validating
the concept of HDAC6 degradation in the lysosome. As
we had also found in our system that AMPK signaling
was essential for autophagosome formation upstream of
mTOR, we are thus at present unsure whether the actions
of the AMPK regulate HDAC6 expression levels through
direct phosphorylation or indirectly through modulation
of mTOR and autophagy. Studies beyond the scope of
the present manuscript will be required to understand the
complexity of HDAC6 expression/activity regulation/
lysosomal protease activity by AR42.
Although the combination of trametinib/dabrafenib
has considerably prolonged disease free progression

and overall survival for patients with mutant B-RAF
melanoma, eventually tumor cells under the restrictive
pressure of the drug combination evolve mechanisms
of resistance. To determine in a side-by-side fashion the
relative effectiveness of trametinib/dabrafenib, pazopanib,
AR42 and [pazopanib + AR42] we performed in vivo
studies using MEL28 cells made resistant by in vitro
culture with trametinib/dabrafenib. Animals were treated
for three days with the drugs using a dosing schedule and
drug levels approximately equivalent to the standard of
care in melanoma and to our on-going phase I trial in
sarcoma/RCC combining [pazopanib + AR42]. Treatment
of animals for three days with trametinib/dabrafenib
initially suppressed tumor growth but over time did not
prolong animal survival. Survival for animals treated with

Figure 14: A simplified model of the molecular pathways by which pazopanib and AR42 combine to kill cancer cells. As

an HDAC inhibitor, AR42 causes DNA damage and causes inhibitory chaperone acetylation. Pazopanib, as a multi-kinase and chaperone
inhibitor, also inhibits chaperone activities as well as many class III receptor tyrosine kinases. DNA damage causes activation of ATM. ATM
signals to activate the AMPK. AMPK signaling inactivates RAPTOR and TSC2 resulting in the inactivation of mTORC1 and mTORC2.
Downstream of mTOR is the kinase ULK-1; the drug combination via AMPK promotes ULK-1 S317 phosphorylation which activates
the kinase; the drug combination via mTOR inactivation reduces ULK-1 S757 phosphorylation which also activates the kinase. Activated
ULK-1 phosphorylates ATG13 which is the key gate-keeper step in permitting autophagosome formation. AR42-induced ATM signaling
also acts to reduce the activities of multiple chaperone proteins. Reduced HSP90 and HSP70 function lowers the expression of all receptor
tyrosine kinases and the activities of STAT3, STAT5, ERK1/2 and AKT that results in lower expression of ROS/RNS detoxifying enzymes
such as TRX and SOD2. Reduced GRP78 function causes activation of PERK and subsequently eIF2α. Enhanced eIF2α signaling reduces
the transcription of proteins with short half-lives such as c-FLIP-s, MCL-1 and BCL-XL, and enhances expression of Beclin1, DR4 and
DR5. Thus the convergent actions of reduced HSP90 and HSP70 chaperone activity and eIF2α signaling lead to a profound reduction in
the protein levels of c-FLIP-s, MCL-1 and BCL-XL which facilitates death receptor signaling through CD95, DR4 and DR5 to activate
the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Enhanced Beclin1 expression converges with elevated ATG13 phosphorylation to produce high levels of
autophagosome formation that acts to reduce HDAC2/5/6/10/11 expression but also to stall autophagosome fusion with lysosomes and to
stall autolysosome maturation, which likely through cytosolic cathepsin proteases converges with the extrinsic apoptosis pathway to cleave
BID and cause mitochondrial dysfunction. Tumor cell killing downstream of the mitochondrion was mediated by AIF and not caspases
3/7. The tumoricidal actions of AIF were facilitated by reduced HSP70 functionality as this chaperone can sequester AIF in the cytosol and
prevent its translocation to the nucleus.

trametinib/dabrafenib was enhanced by approximately
four days, arguing that the anti-tumor effects of RAF/MEK
inhibition were related to growth arrest effects and not to
actual tumor cell killing. As single agents both pazopanib
and AR42 significantly enhanced animal survival, each by
approximately 8 days, arguing that both growth arrest and
tumor cell killing effects were occurring. The combination
of [pazopanib + AR42] caused a further significant
enhancement in animal survival over that afforded by
either pazopanib or AR42 alone, and that was associated
with an initial prolonged reduction in tumor mass below
pre-treatment levels. Collectively, the in vivo data using
trametinib/dabrafenib resistant MEL28 cells argues that
the combination of pazopanib with AR42, or with sodium
valproate, should be explored as a new phase I/II trial in
mutant B-RAF melanoma patients.
In prior studies we have performed antibody
array multiplex analyses to define biomarkers in tumors
and animal plasma previously exposed to various
drug combination [4, 11, 39]. In the present studies we
discovered that transient HDAC inhibitor treatment
of melanoma tumors resulted in several profound
evolutionary changes in tumor cell biology. Notably,
AR42 doubled the already high expression of human
PDGF in mouse plasma, a compensatory effect that
may explain why the phase I trial in melanoma using
panobinostat as a single agent failed; whatever anti-tumor
effects panobinostat may have exhibited would have
been swamped by the compensatory induction of PDGF
expression. In addition, the post-therapy plasma levels
of bFGF, HGF, G-CSF and prolactin were also elevated.
Pazopanib is a recognized inhibitor of VEGFR1-3, FGF
family receptors, PDGFRα/β, c-KIT and FMS. Thus
under a treatment protocol with AR42 where pazopanib
is dosed daily, the evolution of elevated levels of PDGF
and bFGF will be counteracted by the kinase-inhibitory
actions of pazopanib. Pazopanib does not block signaling
by c-MET, SRC family kinases or Janus kinases, enzymes
predicted to be activated by HGF, G-CSF and prolactin.
We discovered that inhibition of MET-STAT3 signaling
could enhance [pazopanib + AR42] lethality. Future
studies focused on the MET-STAT3 axis will be required
to fully define the complex signaling network by which
[pazopanib + AR42] treated cells evolve and survive.
The impact of altered cytokine expression in the evolved
surviving tumors will required studies beyond the scope of
the present manuscript.

Methods
Culture and in vitro exposure of cells to drugs
All cell lines were cultured at 37°C (5% (v/v CO2)
in vitro using RPMI supplemented with dialyzed 5%
(v/v) fetal calf serum and 10% (v/v) Non-essential amino
acids. In vitro drug treatments were generally from a
100 mM stock solution of each drug and the maximal
concentration of Vehicle carrier (VEH; DMSO) in media
was 0.02% (v/v). Cells were not cultured in reduced
serum media during any study in this manuscript.
Unless otherwise stated, cells were treated with vehicle
control, pazopanib (1 µM), AR42 600 nM, or the drugs
in combination for 6 h–24 h. Where indicated cells were
also treated with trametinib (2.0 µM) and dabrafenib
(2.0 µM) combined; MEL28-R cells were generated by
being grown in the presence of trametinib (2.0 µM) and
dabrafenib (2.0 µM) for 14 days. Surviving cells were
collected and 14 days later re-exposed to the drugs for
14 days. For cell death analyses, at the indicated time
point floating cells were cyto-spun onto the 96 well plate
and cell viability determined using a live/dead viability
stain. For immuno-fluorescence studies cells are fixed in
place and permeabilized using ice cold PBS containing
0.4% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% Triton X-100.

Transfection of cells with siRNA or with
plasmids
For Plasmids: Cells were plated and 24 h after
plating, transfected. Plasmids expressing a specific
mRNA (or siRNA) or appropriate vector control plasmid
DNA was diluted in 50 μl serum-free and antibiotic-free
medium (1 portion for each sample). Concurrently, 2 μl
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), was diluted into 50 μl
of serum-free and antibiotic-free medium (1 portion for
each sample). Diluted DNA was added to the diluted
Lipofectamine 2000 for each sample and incubated at

Detection of cell viability, protein expression and
protein phosphorylation by immuno-fluorescence
using a hermes WiScan machine

room temperature for 30 min. This mixture was added to
each well/dish of cells containing 200 μl serum-free and
antibiotic-free medium for a total volume of 300 μl, and
the cells were incubated for 4 h at 37°C. An equal volume
of 2× medium was then added to each well. Cells were
incubated for 24 h, then treated with drugs.

http://www.idea-bio.com/, Cells (4 × 103) are plated
into each well of a 96 well plate, and cells permitted
to attach and grow for the next 18 h. Based on the
experiment, after 18 h, cells are then either genetically
manipulated, or are treated with drugs. For genetic
manipulation, cells are transfected with plasmids or siRNA
molecules and incubated for an additional 24 h. Cells are
treated with vehicle control or with drugs at the indicated
final concentrations, alone or in combination. Cells are
then isolated for processing at various times following
drug exposure. The 96 well plate is centrifuged/cyto-spun
to associate dead cells (for live-dead assays) with the base
of each well. For live dead assays, after centrifugation,
the media is removed and cells treated with live-dead
reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham MA) and
after 10 min this is removed and the cells in each well are
visualized in the Hermes instrument at 10× magnification.
Green cells = viable; yellow/red cells = dying/dead. The
numbers of viable and dead cells were counted manually
from three images taken from each well combined with
data from another two wells of separately treated cells
(i.e. the data is the mean cell dead from 9 data points
from three separate exposures). For immuno-fluorescence
studies, after centrifugation, the media is removed and
cells are fixed in place and permeabilized using ice cold
PBS containing 0.4% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% Triton
X-100. After 30 min the cells are washed three times with
ice cold PBS and cells are pre-blocked with rat serum for
3 h. Cells are then incubated with a primary antibody to
detect the expression/phosphorylation of a protein (usually
at 1:100 dilution from a commercial vendor) overnight at
37°C. Cells are washed three times with PBS followed
by application of the secondary antibody containing an
associated fluorescent red or green chemical tag. After
3 h of incubation the antibody is removed and the cells
washed again. The cells are visualized at either 10× or
60× in the Hermes machine for imaging assessments. All
immunofluorescent images for each individual protein/
phospho-protein are taken using the identical machine
settings so that the levels of signal in each image can be
directly compared to the level of signal in the cells treated
with drugs. Changes in immunofluorescence intensity are
determined using the Hermes’s integral imaging software
from forty cell images taken from each well combined
with data from another two wells of separately treated cells
(i.e. the data is the mean cell dead from 120 cell imaging
data points from three separate exposures). Similarly, for
presentation, the enhancement of image brightness/contrast
using PhotoShop CS6 is simultaneously performed
for each individual set of protein/phospho-protein to
permit direct comparison of the image intensity between
treatments. Antibodies used include: HSP90 (E289)

Transfection for siRNA
Cells from a fresh culture growing in log phase as
described above, and 24 h after plating transfected. Prior
to transfection, the medium was aspirated and serum-free
medium was added to each plate. For transfection, 10 nM
of the annealed siRNA, the positive sense control doubled
stranded siRNA targeting GAPDH or the negative control
(a “scrambled” sequence with no significant homology
to any known gene sequences from mouse, rat or human
cell lines) were used. Ten nM siRNA (scrambled or
experimental) was diluted in serum-free media. Four μl
Hiperfect (Qiagen) was added to this mixture and the
solution was mixed by pipetting up and down several
times. This solution was incubated at room temp for 10
min, then added drop-wise to each dish. The medium
in each dish was swirled gently to mix, then incubated
at 37°C for 2 h. Serum-containing medium was added
to each plate, and cells were incubated at 37°C for 24
h before then treated with drugs (0–24 h). Additional
immuno-fluorescence/live-dead analyses were performed
at the indicated time points.

Animal studies
Studies were performed according to USDA
regulations under VCU IACUC protocol AD20008.
Athymic male nude mice (~20 g) were injected with
1 × 106 Trametinib/Dabrafenib resistant MEL28 cells
(MEL28-R cells) into their rear flank (10 animals per
treatment group; 5 groups; a total of 50 mice). The SKMEL-28 line was established from an axillary lymph
node of a 51-year-old male of unknown ethnicity. Tumors
were permitted to form for 7 days with tumors at that
time exhibiting a mean volume of 9.0 mm3. Mice were
treated for 3 days by oral gavage with vehicle control,
trametinib (30 mg/kg), dabrafenib (2.0 mg/kg), pazopanib
(20 mg/kg), AR42 (15 mg/kg, Days 1 and 3) or the drugs
in combination, as indicated. Before, during and after
drug treatment tumors are calipered as indicated in the
Figure and tumor volume was assessed up to 20–40 days
later. The -Fold increase in tumor volume is plotted
in Figure 13A. When the volume of the tumor reached
> 250 mm3, (equivalent of a 0.75 kg tumor in a 60 kg
person), animals were humanely sacrificed and the tumor
and blood removed for further studies. Animal survival
was plotted on a Kaplan–Meier graph and longitudinal
statistical assays performed to determine whether any
changes were significant (Figure 13B).

was determined using the chaperones still linked to the
Sepharose 4B beads. The Sepharose beads were equilibrated
in the reaction buffer provided by the manufacturer for
30 min with gentle mixing, and the beads recovered by
centrifugation. The beads were then resuspended 1:1 with
reaction buffer. To each well of a 96 well plate was added
50 μl of bead slurry and 50 μl of substrate buffer solution
containing vehicle control or drug to achieve the desired
final drug concentrations. The reactions were started using
a multi-channel pipette delivering 50 μl of reconstituted
reagent to each well. The plate was placed in foil in an
orbital shaker at 37°C for 15 min. The plate was removed,
centrifuged to remove floating Sepharose beads, and 100 μl
of the supernatant from each well placed into a new well
in another 96 well plate. The light emitted from each well/
treatment condition was quantified using a Vector 3 plate
reader (n = 3 of three studies +/− SEM).

Assessment of autophagy
Cells were transfected with a plasmid to express
a green fluorescent protein (GFP) and red fluorescent
protein (RFP) tagged form of LC3 (ATG8). For analysis
of cells transfected with the GFP-RFP-LC3 construct,
the GFP/RFP-positive vesicularized cells were examined
under the ×40 objective of a Zeiss Axiovert fluorescent
microscope. At each time point the mean number of
intense GFP/RFP-LC3 punctae per cell was determined
from at least 40 cells per condition.

Data analysis
Comparison of the effects of various treatments
(performed in triplicate three times) was using one-way
analysis of variance and a two tailed Student’s t-test.
Statistical examination of in vivo animal survival data
utilized both a two tailed Student’s t-test and log rank
statistical analyses between the different treatment groups.
Differences with a p-value of < 0.05 were considered
statistically significant. Experiments shown are the means
of multiple individual points from multiple experiments
(± SEM).
