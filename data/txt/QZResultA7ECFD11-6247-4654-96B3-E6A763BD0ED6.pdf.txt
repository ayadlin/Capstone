Abstract
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a B-cell malignancy characterized by the expansion of clonal plasma blasts/plasma
cells within the bone marrow that relies on multiple signaling cascades, including tyrosine kinase activated
pathways, to proliferate and evade cell death. Despite emerging new treatment strategies, multiple myeloma
remains at present incurable. Thus, novel approaches targeting several signaling cascades by using the multityrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), sorafenib, seem a promising treatment approach for multiple myeloma. Here, we
show that sorafenib induces cell death in multiple myeloma cell lines and in CD138þ-enriched primary multiple
myeloma patient samples in a caspase-dependent and -independent manner. Furthermore, sorafenib has a strong
antitumoral and -angiogenic activity in the 5T33MM mouse model leading to increased overall survival. Multiple
myeloma cells undergo autophagy in response to sorafenib, and inhibition of this cytoprotective pathway
potentiated the efﬁcacy of this TKI. Mcl-1, a survival factor in multiple myeloma, is downregulated at the protein
level by sorafenib allowing for the execution of cell death, as ectopic overexpression of this protein protects
multiple myeloma cells. Concomitant targeting of Mcl-1 by sorafenib and of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL by the antagonist
ABT737 improves the efﬁcacy of sorafenib in multiple myeloma cell lines and CD138þ-enriched primary cells in
the presence of bone marrow stromal cells. Altogether, our data support the use of sorafenib as a novel therapeutic
modality against human multiple myeloma, and its efﬁcacy may be potentiated in combination with ABT737.

Multiple myeloma accounts for 1% of all malignancies and 10%
of all hematologic malignancies (2). Recently introduced drugs,
such as thalidomide, lenalidomide, or bortezomib, in the clinic
have improved survival and are therefore widely used as a ﬁrstand second-line treatment against multiple myeloma. Albeit the
use of these drugs, the 5-year relative survival rate has only
marginally increased and patients with multiple myeloma eventually relapse, thus further highlighting the unmet medical need
for new therapeutic agents (3–5).
Multiple myeloma is characterized by the activation of
multiple of tyrosine kinase signaling cascades, that induce 3
main downstream pathways, the Raf/MEK/ERK1/2, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT, and the Jak/STAT3. One of
the main downstream effects of these cascades is the inhibition
of cell death, mainly by the overexpression of antiapoptotic
Bcl-2 family members such as Mcl-1, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL, as well
as the downregulation of pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins
such as Bim (6–10).
Targeting of multiple activated tyrosine kinase signaling
cascades with chemical inhibitors maybe a promising therapeutic strategy against multiple myeloma. Such a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is sorafenib, a novel bi-aryl urea, a
type II inhibitor primarily against Raf1, VEGF receptor
(VEGFR), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor

Sorafenib Is a Potent Anticancer Agent against Multiple Myeloma

(PDGFR)b (11). Sorafenib is already in use in the clinic for
the treatment of renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular
cancer (12).
Multiple myeloma pathogenesis, proliferation, and response
to therapy largely depend on the bone marrow microenvironment (13). The complex interplay between multiple myeloma
cells and stromal cells involves numerous growth factors, most
predominantly insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and interleukin (IL)-6, but also cytokines such as TNF-a, TGF-b, and VEGF,
which are secreted by the multiple myeloma cells. These
cytokines in turn may induce IL-6, IGF-1, and PDGFb secretion
from bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC; ref. 13). Recent
advances in the understanding of molecular mechanisms
underlying the pathogenesis and progression of multiple myeloma indicate that the use of TKIs as single agents or used in
combinatorial regimens may constitute a good therapeutic
approach.
In the present study, we investigated the efﬁcacy of sorafenib
as a multiple myeloma anticancer agent in cell lines, patient
samples, and mice. We have found that sorafenib is a potent
inducer of caspase-dependent and -independent cell death
even in the presence of BMSCs. Furthermore, we found that
autophagy is cytoprotective and that the usage of autophagy
inhibitors such as chloroquine enhances the cytotoxic effects
of sorafenib. The efﬁcacy of sorafenib can also be improved by
the combination with the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL antagonist ABT737 in
inducing cell death in the multiple myeloma cell lines and in
primary multiple myeloma samples.

had a relapse and 9 and 10 who were previously treated with
bortezomib with no particular therapeutic beneﬁt (Table 1).
The study was approved by the regional ethics committee, and
all patients gave their informed consent in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki. Heparinized bone marrow samples
were obtained and mononuclear cells separated by FicollPaque Plus density sedimentation (Amersham Biosciences)
were puriﬁed with EasySep Human CD138 Selection Kit
according to manufacturer's protocol (StemCell Technologies). The puriﬁed tumor cells were seeded at 1  106 cells/
mL into 12- or 48-well plates followed by immediate addition of
the anti-cancer drugs.

were further puriﬁed by using Ficoll-Paque Plus density sedimentation (Amersham Biosciences). A total of 2  105 cells
were plated in each well of 12-well plates and treated with
10 mmol/L sorafenib or ABT737 for 24 and 48 hours. Subsequently, the cells were harvested and apoptosis was measured
by Annexin V staining.
Cells lines and transfections
L88, the human BMSC line, has been previously described
(14). The human multiple myeloma cell lines OPM-2, U-266,
LP1, NCI-H929, Karpas 620, and RPMI-8226 were kindly provided by Dr. Brigitte Sola (Universite de Caen, Caen, France).
The bortezomib-sensitive RPMI-8226 cells and bortezomibresistant 8226/7B680 cell lines were provided by Dr. Javier
Naval (Universidad de Zaragoza, Saragossa, Spain). All cell lines
were authenticated by the LGC standards cell line authentication service. The murine 5T33MM vitro cells were cultured as
described previously (15). Cells were maintained in a 37 C, 5%
CO2, fully humidiﬁed incubator and were grown in RPMI-1640
(Hyclone) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone), L-glutamate,
and antibiotics penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco). In all experiments, the cells were cultured in 6- or 12-well plates 24 hours
before treatment.
The pCDNA3.3 and MCL1-WT were introduced into OPM-2
and RPMI-8226 cells by DMRIE-C (Invitrogen) according to
manufacturer's instructions. Mcl-1 wild-type plasmid was
produced by cloning of Mcl-1 segment of Mcl-1PGEX plasmid.
Coculture experiments
L88 cells were plated in 6- or 12-well plate 2 hours before
putting cell culture inserts (BD Falcon) in the wells, which
contained multiple myeloma cell lines. The cells were incubated together overnight before treatment.
Assessment of apoptosis and immunostainings for ﬂow
cytometry
Exposure of phosphatidylserine as a marker of apoptosis was
assessed by Annexin V-FLUOS (Roche; ref. 8). Brieﬂy, 2  105
cells per sample were collected, washed in PBS, pelleted, and
re-suspended in incubation buffer (10 mmol/L HEPES/NaOH,
pH 7.4, 140 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L CaCl2) containing
1% Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) followed by analysis on ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorter Calibur ﬂow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) using the CellQuest software. To
detect sorafenib changes in mitochondrial membrane
potential, cell were stained with tetramethylrhodamine
ethyl ester perchlorate (TMRE; Molecular Probes Inc.) as
previously described (8). To measure the pro-apoptotic
activation of Bak and caspase-3, intracellular stainings were
conducted as previously described and measured by ﬂow
cytometry (8).
Immunocytochemistry
The effect of sorafenib on multiple myeloma cell lines was
analyzed by staining of mitochondria with MitoTracker
(Molecular Probes Inc.) and costaining with either active
Bak antibody or cytochrome c antibody as previously
described (9).

Resazurin assay
Puriﬁed multiple myeloma cells (patients 1, 2, 7, and 8) were
incubated with sorafenib alone or in combination with Bcl-2
antagonist (ABT737) for 24 and 48 hours. At harvest, 10%
resazurin was added followed by incubation for 2 to 3 hours
at 37 C in a humidiﬁed 5% CO2 in-air atmosphere. The
resazurin was excited at 530 nm, and the emitted light was
measured at 590 nm. Analysis of ﬂuorescence was conducted
using Wallac Victor Multilabel Counter (Wallac). Mean was
calculated from duplicate or triplicate wells and subtracted
from mean of blank wells resulting in DFluorescence. The
relative number of viable cells was expressed as percentage
of untreated control and calculated as 100  DFluorescence
(treated wells)/DFluorescence (untreated wells).
Cell-cycle analysis
We used NucleoCounter NC-3000from ChemoMetec to analyze cell cycle according to the manufacturer's speciﬁcations.
One million cells were harvested and washed by PBS then resuspended in 0.5 mL solution 10 supplemented with 10 mg/mL
40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Cells were incubated at
37 C for 5 minutes and then 0.5 mL solution 11 was added and
30 mL of suspended cells was loaded on 2-chamber slide (NCSlide A2) and cell cycle was analyzed by using provided software.
Mitochondria isolation
A total of 2  107 cells were harvested, and mitochondria
were isolated using the Mitochondria Isolation Kit (Pierce
Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's speciﬁcations.
Immunoblot analyses
Cells were harvested and homogenized in radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) lysis buffer (10 mmol/L Tris, pH 7.2,
150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton, 0.1% SDS,
5 mmol/L EDTA) containing complete protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche Diagnostics). After 1 hour on ice, samples
were sonicated and protein quantiﬁcation was carried out
using a Bio-Rad protein assay. Equal amounts of soluble
proteins (15–30 mg) were denaturated by boiling and resolved
by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane.
After blocking in 5% non-fat dry milk in PBS for 1 hour and
probing with a speciﬁc primary antibody and a horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody, the protein bands
were detected by chemiluminescence (Supersignal, Pierce) and
X-ray ﬁlm exposure (Kodak). Protein loading was normalized
by using anti-GAPDH or antiactin antibodies.
RNA extraction, cDNA, and quantitative reverse
transcriptase PCR
The RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy mini kit
(Qiagen) and DNase treated (Ambion Turbo DNA-free, Life
Technologies). Roughly, 100 to 500 ng of DNase-treated RNA
was used in the generation of cDNAs using MuMLV (Life
Technologies) and a mixture of oligoDt18 with nanomers (IDT
technologies). Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR quantiﬁcation was carried out using the KAPA 2G SyberGreen
(Kapa biosystems) on the Applied Biosystems 7900HT platform with the following conditions: 95 C for 3 minutes, 95 C

Animals and 5T33MMvv multiple myeloma model
The 5T33MM model originated spontaneously in aging
C57BL/KaLwRij mice and has since been propagated in vivo
by intravenous transfer of the diseased marrow in young
syngeneic mice (16). C57BL/KaLwRijHsd mice were purchased
from Harlan CPB. Female mice, 8 weeks old when used, were
housed and treated following the conditions approved by the
Ethical Committee for Animal Experiments, VUB (license no.
LA1230281).
In vivo analysis of tumor burden
To study the effects of sorafenib, on myeloma progression, 2
groups of C57BL/KaLwRijHsd mice (n ¼ 10) were injected i.v.
with 0.5  106 5T33MMvv cells; 1 group of 10 naive mice was
included as negative control. Three days after tumor cell
inoculation, mice were treated with either sorafenib (daily,
oral gavage, 60 mg/kg) or vehicle (1:4 dilution of 50:50 Sigma
Cremophor EL; 95% ethanol) until the vehicle-treated
5T33MM-bearing mice showed signs of morbidity. Serum M
component was assessed using standard electrophoretic techniques. Bone marrow tumor burden was assessed by determining plasmacytosis on cytosmears (15). A similar experimental setup was used to assess the effects of sorafenib
treatment on overall survival. Mice were treated daily and
were sacriﬁced upon signs of morbidity. As a control for
possible side effects, we have treated naive C57BlKaLwRij mice
either with sorafenib 60 mg/kg mouse daily oral gavage or with
vehicle. Twenty-one days after treatment, mice were weighted,
sacriﬁced, and different samples taken. Peripheral blood was
analyzed for white and red blood cell count; samples of skin,
kidney, spleen, heart, lung, and liver were ﬁxed, and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections were evaluated.
Assessment of microvessel density
Microvessel density (MVD) was determined by CD31 staining as previously described (7). Brieﬂy, mouse femurs were
ﬁxed in zinc ﬁxative for 48 hours, decalciﬁed for 48 hours, and
embedded in parafﬁn. After blocking with normal goat serum,
sections were incubated with a rat anti-CD31 antibody
(PECAM-1, 1:10; Pharmingen) overnight at 4 C. A biotin-conjugated goat anti-rat antibody was used as secondary antibody
(1:75 dilution, Pharmingen). A streptavidin–horseradish peroxidase conjugate in combination with tyramide signal ampliﬁcation (TSA; NEN Life Science) was used for detection. In the
area with the highest blood vessel density (hot spot), the
number of blood vessels was counted per 0.22 mm2.
Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis was conducted by Mann–Whitney U
test; P < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant. All reported P values
are 2-sided. For the survival assays, Kaplan–Meier analysis was
used.

Results
Sorafenib induces cell death in a panel of human
multiple myeloma cells
The panel of human cell lines, representative of multiple
myeloma, U-266, LP1, OPM-2, NCI-H929, RPMI-8226, and
Karpas 620, were exposed for 24 hours to increasing concentration of sorafenib, and the number of dead cells was measured by Annexin V (AnnV)/PI stainings (Fig. 1A). Sorafenib
induced cell death in all cell lines of the panel with RPMI-8226
being the most sensitive and U-266 being the least sensitive.
Treatment of the multiple myeloma cell lines with 10 mmol/L
sorafenib for 24, 48, and 72 hours resulted in progressive
eradication of the majority of multiple myeloma cell lines
tested except for the U-266 cells, which maintained around
50% viability even after 72 hours of treatment (Fig. 1B). Cellcycle analysis of the multiple myeloma cell lines treated with
sorafenib revealed an accumulation of the cells in the G0–G1
phase (Supplementary Fig. S1). In an attempt to characterize
the mode of cell death, we examined a number of well-deﬁned
apoptotic markers (Fig. 1C–G). We found that sorafenib
induced apoptotic cell death characterized by mitochondrial
depolarization, cytochrome c release, Bak and caspase-3 activation, and nuclear condensation/fragmentation.
Sorafenib induces caspase-dependent and -independent
cell death
Sorafenib-induced cell death was accompanied by activation of the effector caspase-3 and -7 in all the multiple myeloma
cell lines, already observed after 8 hours of treatment (Fig. 2A
and B). Coadministration of the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VADFMK with sorafenib led to a marked inhibition of caspase-7
activation and PARP cleavage (cl-PARP; Fig. 2C). The pancaspase inhibitor blocked cell death in U-266 and RPMI-8226
cells but had little effect in the rest of the multiple myeloma
cell lines (Fig. 2D). In agreement with the ﬂow cytometric data,
z-VAD-FMK could partly block the caspase-dependent nuclear fragmentation and rescue RPMI-8226 cells but was
largely ineffective in blocking nuclear condensation and phosphatidyl exposure in OPM-2 cells (Fig. 2E). The caspase-independent cell death observed in LP1 and OPM-2 is not necrotic, as cotreatment with Necrostatin1 did not attenuate
sorafenib-induced death (Fig. 2F and data not shown, respectively). These data suggests that sorafenib, in most of the
cell lines examined, induces caspase-dependent cell death,
whereas in LP1 and OPM-2 cells, the cell death is caspaseindependent.
One of the key mediators of a caspase-independent cell
death is the apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF; ref. 17). We therefore examined the possibility that AIF was involved in the cell
death signaling cascade induced in LP1 and OPM-2 cells. In the
panel of multiple myeloma cell lines, we assessed the AIF
cleavage in response to sorafenib and found such a posttranslational modiﬁcation in LP1 and OPM-2 cells (Fig. 2G). Isolation of mitochondria and cytoplasm from LP1 cells treated
with sorafenib and incubation with an anti-AIF antibody
revealed that AIF is released to the cytoplasm in response to
sorafenib treatment (Fig. 2H). The translocation of AIF was
further shown by immunoﬂuorescence (Fig. 2I). In LP1 and

Sorafenib induces autophagy in multiple myeloma cells
Autophagy is generally considered to be a cytoprotective
pathway and protects cancer cells by removing damaged
organelles and providing nutrients. In this study, we wanted
to investigate the role of autophagy in sorafenib-induced cell
death. One of the main negative modulators of autophagy is

LC3-II and an increase in the levels of active caspase-7 (Fig. 3C).
Pretreatment of multiple myeloma cell lines with chemical
inhibitors of early (3-MA) and late autophagy (chloroquine) on
sorafenib-induced cell death led to a potentiation of sorafenibinduced cell death in LP1, OPM-2, and H929 cells (Fig. 3D).
Further support on the involvement of mTOR in sorafenibinduced autophagy came from the experiments with the mTOR
inhibitor, rapamycin, in combination with sorafenib. Treatment of LP1 and OPM-2 cells with rapamycin and sorafenib
partially protected these multiple myeloma cell lines from
sorafenib-induced cell death (Fig. 3E). Together, these data
indicate that sorafenib-induced autophagy is cytoprotective,
and inhibition of this pathway can potentiate the efﬁcacy of
sorafenib.
Downregulation of Mcl-1 protein levels is critical for
sorafenib-induced cell death
It has been previously described that PI3K/AKT and Ras/
Raf/MAPK kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal–regulated kinase
(ERK) 1/2 pathways play a critical role in the survival of
multiple myeloma cells (18). We examined the levels of AKT
and ERK1/2 serine phosphorylation and the possibility that
sorafenib acts by inhibiting these pathways in the panel of
human multiple myeloma cell lines. OPM-2 cells, which are
PTEN-null, display a constitutively active AKT that may be

partially inhibited by sorafenib (Fig. 4A). In LP1, H929, and
RPMI-8226 cells, AKT phosphorylation was induced by sorafenib. ERK1/2 was constitutively active in U-266 and LP1 cells
and this phosphorylation is potently inhibited by sorafenib,
whereas in the rest of the cell lines, ERK1/2 phosphorylation
was not dramatically altered (Fig. 4A). Bim, a BH3-only protein
that is known to play a critical role in multiple myeloma cells
undergoing cell death, was also examined (19). LP1 does not
express Bim due to biallelic deletion of this gene (7). However,
in all remaining multiple myeloma cell lines of the panel, Bim
was downregulated. This is in agreement with the induction of
AKT phosphorylation observed in response to sorafenib. These
data suggest that Bim is not an important mediator of sorafenib-induced cell death in multiple myeloma cells.
The cytoprotective effect of Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling
cascade is partly mediated by the inhibition of degradation
and subsequent stabilization of Mcl-1 proteins levels (20, 21).
Mcl-1 is one of the major antiapoptotic proteins expressed in
multiple myeloma cells, and resistance to drug treatment
has been associated with high levels of Mcl-1 expression. To
determine whether sorafenib-induced cell death was associated with modulation of Mcl-1 expression, we investigated the
effect of sorafenib on Mcl-1 protein levels by Western blotting.
Mcl-1 protein levels were downregulated in all the cell lines of
the panel, an effect observed already at 8 hours of treatment

As expected, U0126 inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation but had
no or little effect on Mcl-1 levels neither alone nor in combination with sorafenib (Fig. 4C). Treatment of the multiple
myeloma cell lines with U0126 alone did not induce cell death
in the multiple myeloma cell lines, and the combination with

show that the observed Mcl-1 downregulation by sorafenib is
independent of the Raf/MEK/ERK1/2 pathway.
To gain further insights into the mechanism by which
sorafenib induces the downregulation of Mcl-1, a number of
signaling cascades known to regulate Mcl-1–including transcription, translation, caspase cleavage, proteosomal, and in
some cases, autophagosomal degradation were investigated
(22–24). We found that posttranslational modiﬁcations are not

responsible for the downregulation of Mcl-1 levels in cells
treated with sorafenib (Supplementary Fig. S2). Interestingly,
despite the decrease in total Mcl-1 protein levels observed in
multiple myeloma cells treated with sorafenib, Mcl-1 mRNA is
induced after 8 and 24 hours (Fig. 4E). It has been previously
shown that the effects of sorafenib on protein levels maybe
mediated by inhibition of phosphorylation of components of
the translational machinery (25). Notably, treatment with
sorafenib led to an inhibition of the phosphorylation and
activation of eIF4E, a key player in the initiation of translation
(Fig. 4F).
To determine the functional importance of Mcl-1 downregulation in sorafenib-induced cell death, we transfected
OPM-2 and RPMI cells with a construct overexpressing Mcl1. We found that it can substantially protect OPM-2 cells and
partially protect RPMI-8226 cells against apoptosis here determined as exposure of PS, caspase-3 activation, and PARP
cleavage (Fig. 4G and H). These data suggest that downregula-

Sorafenib Is a Potent Anticancer Agent against Multiple Myeloma

system between L88 BMSCs and U-266, RPMI-8226, and OPM-2
cells. Because the effect of the stroma on multiple myeloma
cell survival is largely dependent on their response to IL-6, we
anticipated the effects of stroma on sorafenib cytotoxic efﬁcacy to be IL-6–dependent. Indeed, in the IL-6–dependent
RPMI-8226 cells, sorafenib-induced cell death was potentiated when cocultured with BMSCs (Fig. 5C). In contrast, the
sorafenib-induced cell death was equally efﬁcient in the IL-6–
independent U-266 in mono- or coculture. Downstream of the
activated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), a number of common signaling pathways converge, that is, the Janus-activated
kinase (Jak)/STAT, the PI3K/AKT, and the aforementioned
RAF/MEK/ERK1/2, all of which were upregulated in the presence of BMSCs (Fig. 5D). Importantly, the levels of STAT3
phosphorylation, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 expression in the monoand coculture correlated well with the protection mediated
by the BMSCs from sorafenib-induced death in RPMI-8226
cells (Fig. 5D). The potentiation of cell death in coculture
of OPM-2 with L88 cells was associated with the inhibition
of AKT phosphorylation, downregulation of Bcl-xL, and the
sustained expression of Bim protein levels in response to
sorafenib (Fig. 5D).
Having established that 10 mmol/L sorafenib is equally
efﬁcient in the treatment of primary multiple myeloma patient
samples as was shown for the cells in the multiple myeloma cell
line panel, samples from 4 additional patients with multiple
myeloma were treated in monoculture or in BMSCs cocultured
with sorafenib for 24 and 48 hours, and the levels of cell death
were measured by conducting CD138þ/Annexin Vþ double
stainings to immunophenotypically detect multiple myeloma
cells and measure cell death (Fig. 5E and F). In the monoculture setting, sorafenib was very potent in inducing cell death
in all the primary samples. In the coculture setting, L88 cells
protected the CD138þ primary multiple myeloma cells from
spontaneous cell death but they were still sensitive to sorafenib
treatment (Fig. 5E and F). Because of the lack of sufﬁcient
amount of cells, samples from patients 5 and 6 were cultured
only in the presence of L88 cells for 48 hours, and we found that
multiple myeloma cell from patient 5 were very sensitive to
sorafenib, and 50% of multiple myeloma cells from patient 6
died upon sorafenib treatment (Fig. 5F). To determine whether
the molecular determinants of sorafenib efﬁcacy identiﬁed in
multiple myeloma cell lines were also found in patient samples,
we treated a bone marrow sample, ex vivo, with sorafenib and
examined the proteins levels of Mcl-1, the cleavage of PARP,
and the levels of autophagy (Fig. 5G). We found that sorafenib
downregulates Mcl-1 and induces PARP cleavage and autophagy in these multiple myeloma primary patient cells, in
concordance with the cell line experiments.

in partial resistance to sorafenib showing the importance of
Bcl-2 in the protection of multiple myeloma cells to sorafenibinduced cell death (Fig. 6B).
Because sorafenib potently downregulates Mcl-1 protein
levels, we hypothesized that a combination with a Bcl-2
antagonist would lead to the concomitant targeting of all 3
major antiapoptotic proteins in multiple myeloma cells and
thereby potentiate the efﬁcacy of sorafenib. The multiple
myeloma cell lines were treated with either sorafenib alone
or in combination with ABT737 (Fig. 6C). LP1 and OPM-2
cells became more sensitive to sorafenib in the presence of
ABT737, whereas NCI-H929 and Karpas 620 cell lines were as
sensitive to sorafenib as to ABT737 alone.
The efﬁcacy of this combination therapy was also examined
in the coculture setting with L88 and the U-266, RPMI-8226,
and OPM-2 multiple myeloma cell lines. Even though RPMI8226 was not sensitive to sorafenib in the presence of BMSCs
(Fig. 5A), ABT737 alone or the combination with sorafenib with
ABT737 overcame this protection and induced high levels of
cell death (Fig. 6D). Furthermore, ABT737 potentiated the
efﬁcacy of sorafenib in OPM-2 cells, even in the presence of
L88 cells (Fig. 6D).
On the basis of the efﬁcacy observed in multiple myeloma
cell lines treated with the combination of sorafenib and
ABT737, 2 CD138þ multiple myeloma patient samples, one in
relapse (patient 7) and one newly diagnosed (patient 8), were
treated similarly and cell death was measured (Fig. 6E). The
combination of sorafenib with ABT737 showed potent efﬁcacy
in killing primary CD138þ-enriched multiple myeloma cells.
Collectively, these data show that this rationale-based combination is effective in the treatment of multiple myeloma cells
both in vitro and ex vivo.
Bortezomib is now introduced as a therapeutic modality
against multiple myeloma (26). Despite its promising therapeutic effects, patients develop resistance to this proteasome
inhibitor (26). To investigate whether sorafenib treatment is
effective against bortezomib-resistant cells, we used a recently
published model system of RPMI-8226 cells that have been
induced to develop resistance to bortezomib (27). Bortezomibsensitive RPMI-8226 and bortezomib-resistant RPMI-8226/
7B680 were grown in the presence of 80 nmol/L bortezomib
and treated with either sorafenib alone or the combination of
sorafenib with ABT737. Importantly, sorafenib induced cell
death in bortezomib-resistant RPMI-8226/7B680 cells and the
combination with ABT737 improved the cytotoxic potency of
sorafenib (Fig. 6F). These results were recapitulated in primary
multiple myeloma cells from patients who have undergone
treatment with bortezomib and found to be nonresponsive
(Fig. 6G).

multiple myeloma cells in vitro and ex vivo
Together with Mcl-1, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL constitute the major
antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins known to be involved in the
acquisition of resistance to therapy. The protein levels of
Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL did not change win response to sorafenib
with the exception of Bcl-xL that decreased in the OPM-2 cells
(Fig. 6A). Ectopic expression of Bcl-2 in the U-266 cells resulted

To investigate the efﬁcacy of sorafenib in murine multiple
myeloma cells, we evaluated a dose curve and found that it
induces dose- and time-dependent cell death in 5T33MM cells

bone marrow accompanied by rich vascular network and no
residual normal hematopoiesis (Fig. 7E). In the H&E-stained
section of a bone marrow of a mouse treated with sorafenib,
there is almost no residual tumor present (Fig. 7E). In the bone
marrow of a myeloma-bearing mouse, there is an increased
MVD with the majority of the vessels compressed by the
myeloma inﬁltrate. Treatment with sorafenib signiﬁcantly
decreased MVD by 60% in the bone marrow of treated
5T33MMvv mouse, compared with vehicle-treated 5T33MMvv
mice (Fig. 7F and G). No adverse side effects or toxicity were
observed as evaluated by behavior, body weight, histologic, and
hematologic examinations (data not shown).

Discussion
RTK- and non-RTK–activated signaling cascades play a vital
role in the survival and proliferation of multiple myeloma cells
(28). The importance of these (R)TKs for multiple myeloma
carcinogenesis and progression is further underlined by the
initiation of a number of clinical trials in which various TKIs
are used alone or in combination with conventional and
emerging anti–multiple myeloma agents. Sorafenib has shown
promising results against a number of solid tumors (e.g., renal
carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma); however, its potential efﬁcacy in hematologic malignances and especially in
multiple myeloma has received little attention. Also, in the
light of the recent publication of whole-genome sequencing of
revealing 12 of the most common BRAF mutations in 4% of
patients with multiple myeloma targeting this pathway, the use
of sorafenib seems to constitute a promising novel path of
therapy (29).
The described molecular targets for sorafenib are Raf1,
PDGFR, VEGFR, FLT3, and c-KIT, several of which have been
shown to be active in multiple myeloma (18). The multiple
myeloma cell lines selected represent the genetic heterogeneity
seen in multiple myeloma and sorafenib is likely to target at
least one predominant pathway of multiple myeloma survival.
Because the majority of the (R)TK signaling cascades converge
at core downstream pathways, such as Raf/MEK/ERK1/2,
PI3K/AKT, Jak/STAT, we focused, in this study, on the effects
of sorafenib on these pathways. Our results show that the RAF/
MEK/ERK1/2 pathway is targeted in U-266 and LP1, whereas in
OPM-2, the PI3K/AKT pathway is affected by sorafenib. The
predominant pathway of survival in U-266 is STAT3, whereas in
the OPM-2, a constitutively active AKT, due to PTEN deletion,
may be a part of the underlying observation. One intriguing
result is that sorafenib induces AKT phosphorylation in the
majority of the cell lines examined as it has been previously
described (30). The mechanism and the biologic signiﬁcance of
such an induction are not known. It may signify the extensive
cross-talk between the PI3K/AKT and the Raf/MEK/ERK
pathway and the Ras-mediated activation of the PI3K/AKT
pathway (30). It may also be possible that the observed AKT
phosphorylation is mediated by another RTK that is activated
upon treatment with sorafenib. It has been recently shown that
sorafenib-mediated inhibition of Raf phosphorylation may lead
to the activation of the c-MET RTK and its downstream
signaling cascade PI3K/AKT (31).

The antitumoral efﬁcacy of sorafenib may also depend to the
potent inhibition of VEGFR and angiogenesis. This has been
previously shown for renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular
carcinoma where the antiangiogenic effects of sorafenib were
found to be partly responsible for the potent antitumor activity
observed in the clinic (32, 33). In the multiple myeloma setting,
we found that sorafenib signiﬁcantly decreased MVD in the
bone marrow of multiple myeloma mice and indicating that
the antitumoral effects of sorafenib may, at least in part, be
mediated by inhibition of angiogenesis. It is thus likely that it is
the combination of direct cytotoxic effects inﬂicted on multiple myeloma cells and decreased vascularization in the bone
marrow that are responsible for the therapeutic efﬁcacy of
sorafenib.
In this study, we found that sorafenib induces both caspasedependent and -independent cell death in the majority of the
multiple myeloma cell lines and multiple myeloma primary
cells tested, results that are in agreement with a previous report
(30). Interestingly, LP1 and OPM-2 cells, even though they
exhibited all the classical characteristics of apoptosis, were not
rescued by the pre-incubation with the pan-caspase inhibitor
z-VAD-fmk, indicating that several pathways of cell death are
activated by sorafenib. For example, LP1 and OPM-2 are 2 cell
lines in which AIF, a mediator of caspase-independent cell
death, is cleaved, released from the mitochondria, and translocated to the nucleus. The differences in the responses to
sorafenib observed in this panel of multiple myeloma cell lines
as a consequence of genetic heterogeneity including the presence of Ras mutations and other genetic alterations is the
current focus of our further investigations.
The activation of autophagy by TKIs has been described
previously for imatinib mesylate (34). In our experimental
system, sorafenib induced autophagy in several of the cell
lines tested, primary multiple myeloma patient samples, and
mice. By using chemical inhibitors of early and late autophagy,
it became evident that autophagy is induced to protect multiple myeloma cells from sorafenib-mediated cell death. Importantly, rapamycin, a potent inducer of autophagy, partially
protected certain multiple myeloma cell lines from sorafenibinduced cell death, presumably by alleviating the damage
inﬂicted by sorafenib. From these data, we conclude that a
novel therapeutic strategy against multiple myeloma may be
the combination of sorafenib with autophagy inhibitors such
as chloroquine, a combination that at least, in vitro, showed
potent cytotoxic activity.
The tumor stroma has been implicated in modulating not
only the tumor growth but also the acquisition of resistance to
cancer therapy. The impact of the tumor stroma in the survival
of multiple myeloma cells in vitro and ex vivo was conﬁrmed in
our experiments. In particular, STAT3 was highly phosphorylated/activated in the coculture setting than in the monoculture setting. A reasonable explanation for this signature is the
response in selected multiple myeloma cell lines to IL-6
produced from the stroma. The molecular re-wiring of multiple
myeloma cell lines and primary cultures grown under the
paracrine inﬂuence of the BMSCs is ﬁrstly observed by the
lower levels of basal death. This response is well associated
with the activation of all the signaling cascades examined, that

is, RAF/MEK/ERK1/2, PI3K/AKT, and JAK/STAT3 pathways,
which promote the induced expression of a number of antiapoptotic proteins such as Mcl-1 and Bcl-2/Bcl-xL. The responsiveness of the multiple myeloma cell lines and primary
samples to sorafenib cocultured with BMSCs is variable.
RPMI-8226 cells and primary cells from patient 3 were protected by sorafenib in the presence of soluble factors secreted
by the stromal cells. One explanation for this protection could
be the activation of STAT3 by IL-6 and persistence of Mcl-1 and
Bcl-xL protein levels even after treatment with sorafenib in the
coculture setting in this cell line. On the contrary, OPM-2 cells
and cells from patient 4 were more sensitive to sorafenib when
cocultured with sorafenib and stromal cells, a response that
could be mediated by the inhibition of AKT levels and the
induction of Bim expression.
The importance of Mcl-1 for multiple myeloma survival is
well described (35). It has been previously reported that
sorafenib is highly effective in downregulating Mcl-1 in a
number of other experimental models (20, 36). Sorafenib
downregulates the protein levels of Mcl-1 in multiple myeloma,
an event critical that we provide evidence for its importance in
the execution of the cell death program (37). Mcl-1 is known to
be regulated at the transcriptional, translational, and posttranslation level. We found that posttranslational modiﬁcations such as caspase cleavage or proteosomal degradation
were not responsible for the downregulation of Mcl-1 protein
levels induced by sorafenib. Intriguingly, quantitative measurement of Mcl-1 mRNA levels showed a transcriptional
upregulation after 8 and 24 hours of treatment with sorafenib.
The mechanism behind this upregulation is unclear. It is
known that the JAK/STAT3 pathway induces the expression
of Mcl-1 (38). However, as in the majority of our cell lines,
STAT3 was not phosphorylated with the exception of U-266, it
is unlikely that this pathway is responsible for this effect.
Translational mechanisms are most likely to be mediating the
downregulation of Mcl-1 in response to sorafenib. It was
recently shown that inhibition of translation is the most likely
mechanism of Mcl-1 downregulation in leukemic cells (39). In
agreement with these results, we found that sorafenib inhibits
the phosphorylation of eIF4E, a key initiation of protein
translation. The mechanism and the speciﬁcity of translational
inhibition of Mcl-1 in our system requires further investigation.
It has been previously described that ABT737 is a potent
inducer of cell death in multiple myeloma cells (40). However,
the combination of sorafenib with ABT737 with the rationale to
concomitantly target all 3 major Bcl-2 antiapoptotic proteins
(i.e., Mcl-1, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL) and thereby tilting the Bcl-2

rheostat toward cell death has not been previously shown.
Indeed, we found that in all the multiple myeloma cell lines and
in primary samples tested, the combination of these 2 drugs
had better therapeutic efﬁcacy than treatment of sorafenib or
ABT737 alone. Importantly, this combination was very effective in primary multiple myeloma patient samples.
In summary, our study provides compelling evidence for the
future evaluation of the multi-TKI sorafenib as a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of multiple myeloma in the
clinic.
