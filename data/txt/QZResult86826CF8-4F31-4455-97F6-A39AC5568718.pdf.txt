Abstract
The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) A
is abundantly expressed in the majority of human carcinomas
and their metastases. HIF-1A controls central metastasisassociated pathways such as glycolysis, angiogenesis, and
invasion. Functional inhibition of HIF-1A leads to impaired
metastasis formation in murine tumor models. However, the
precise molecular mechanisms underlying the metastasispromoting role of HIF-1A have not been fully characterized.
The ability of transformed epithelial cells to initiate the
metastatic cascade relies on their ability to escape anoikis, a
default program of apoptosis induction following loss of
integrin anchoring to the extracellular matrix. Therefore, we
addressed the function of HIF-1A in anoikis resistance and
anchorage-independent growth. Inhibition of HIF-1A via
RNA interference resulted in up-regulation of A5 integrin
on the cell surface of human gastric cancer cells, whereas
other integrins remained unaffected. Integrin A5 induction
occurred at the level of transcription and was dependent on
elevated intracellular superoxide in HIF-1A-knockdown cells.
HIF-1A–deficient cells displayed significantly increased anoikis susceptibility due to up-regulated A5 integrin. Finally,
colony formation in soft agar was shown to be dependent on
HIF-1A as HIF-1A–deficient cells displayed a 70% reduction in
anchorage-independent proliferation. Results obtained by
RNA interference could be entirely confirmed by application
of the pharmacologic HIF-1A-inhibitor 2-methoxyestradiol.
Hence, our data argue for a pivotal role for HIF-1A in anoikis
control via suppression of A5 integrin. HIF-1A–inhibiting
drugs might therefore offer an innovative strategy for antimetastatic cancer therapy. [Cancer Res 2008;68(24):10113–20]

Introduction
Lack of oxygen (hypoxia) is a hallmark of solid tumor growth and
represents an independent prognostic factor in a diverse range of
human cancers (1). Hypoxia is associated with local invasion,
metastatic spread, and resistance to chemotherapy as well as
radiotherapy, ultimately limiting patients prognosis (1). The
transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) constitutes
the principal mediator of cellular adaptation to hypoxia. HIF-1 is a

heterodimeric protein consisting of a ubiquitously expressed
h-subunit (also known as aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear
translocator) and a hypoxia-inducible a subunit (1). HIF-1 is
centrally involved in a multitude of physiologic and pathophysiologic processes such as embryonal development, glycolysis,
erythropoiesis, myeloid-cell mediated inflammation, bactericidal
activity of phagocytes, and matrix synthesis (2). In human cancer,
HIF-1a overexpression is associated with increased patient
mortality, e.g., in malignant breast, colon, and lung tumors (2).
This association is mainly based on the HIF-1–mediated regulation
of genes that possess pivotal roles in central features of cancer
pathogenesis including: immortalization, cellular dedifferentiation,
genetic instability, vascularization, glycolytic metabolism, as well as
invasion and metastasis (2). Inhibition of HIF-1a by means of RNA
interference or chemical compounds has proven antitumoral
activity in different murine models of cancer (2). Furthermore,
inhibitors of HIF-1 are being tested in clinical studies as anticancer
agents (nine actively recruiting phase I and II studies as of April
2008).4 Elevated apoptotic tumor cell fractions have frequently
been observed in experimental tumors after blockade of HIF-1a.
However, the precise function of HIF-1a in apoptosis regulation
remains controversial and the molecular mechanisms governing
the putative antiapoptotic role of HIF-1a in vivo remain to be
elucidated (2). By applying a lentiviral-mediated RNA interference
system, we observed that HIF-1a–deficient gastric cancer cells are
defective in migration, invasion, and adhesion to endothelial
cells.5 To identify candidate mechanisms linking HIF-1a to
these biological effects, we examined whether integrin expression
patterns had changed after functional inactivation of HIF-1a.
Surprisingly, we were able to show a specific up-regulation of
a5 integrin on human gastric cancer cells after loss of HIF-1a.
Our functional analysis revealed a markedly reduced ability of
HIF-1a–deficient cells to evade anoikis, and we provide experimental evidence for a causal role of a5 integrin in restoring
anoikis susceptibility.

control oligonucleotides (TIB MOLBIOL) were published elsewhere (3, 4).
Oligonucleotides were inserted into BsrGI and XbaI restriction sites of the
lentiviral bicistronic vector pPR1, which allows for coexpression of GFP (5).
Lentiviruses were produced by transient transfection of pPR-HIF-1a or

pPR-scr with packaging vectors in 293T cells using the calcium-phosphate
method. Vector titers were determined by transducing 293T cells with serial
dilutions of concentrated lentivirus, and green fluorescent protein (GFP)
was used to quantitate the transduced cell fraction by flow cytometry
60 h after transduction. Gastric cancer cell lines stably expressing siRNAs
were generated by transduction with lentiviruses at a multiplicity of
infection of 10 for 24 h. Transduction efficiency of target cells was
determined by flow cytometry analysis of GFP using a FACSCalibur (Becton
Dickinson).
Western blot analysis. Immunoblot was performed as described in
detail before (6). Antibodies were against PGK1, YY1 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), CA IX (clone M75; a kind gift of Jaromir Pastorek, Institute
of Virology, Slovak Academy of Science, Bratislava, Slovakia; ref. 7), a5
integrin (BD Transduction Laboratories), av integrin (Chemicon), HIF-1a
(R&D Systems), and h-actin (Sigma-Aldrich).
Transient transfection and reporter luciferase assay. Transfections
were performed as described in detail before (6).
Quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Total cellular RNA was extracted
with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and first strand cDNA was synthesized
with an oligo (dT) primer and a SuperScript First Strand Synthesis System
(Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time PCR analysis was performed by using
TaqMan PCR Universal Mastermix (Applied Biosystems) with a5 integrin
TaqMan probe und primers (Hs00233743_m1; Applied Biosystems). To
normalize the amount of input RNA, PCR reactions were done with probe
and primers for h-actin (probe, 5¶-(6FAM)CCA TCCTAAAAGCCACCCCACTTCTCTCTA(BHQf6FAM)-3¶; forward primer, 5¶-TGCATTGTTACAGGAAGTCCCTT-3¶; reverse primer, 5¶-GGG AGA GGA CTG GGC CAT-3¶).
Analysis of integrin expression by flow cytometry. Cell surface
expression of integrins was determined as described in detail before (8).
Measurement of intracellular superoxide levels. Intracellular superoxide anion levels were estimated using the fluorescent dye dihydroethidium (DHE), obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. After 24 h cultivation, cells were
trypsinized, harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in PBS containing
10 Amol/L DHE for 25 min at 37jC, and thereafter washed with ice-cold
PBS. Dye oxidation was determined by flow cytometry with excitation and
emission settings of 488 and 585 nm, respectively. The mean fluorescence
intensity of at least 1  105 cells was analyzed and corrected for
autofluorescence from unlabeled cells.
Determination of cell cycle distribution and apoptosis by flow
cytometry. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis fraction were determined
from DNA histograms as described before (8). Apoptosis was also
quantitated based on the mitochondrial membrane potential using JC-1
staining (Molecular Probes). Briefly, cells were harvested, centrifuged at
14,000 g for 40 s, resuspended in medium containing JC-1 (5 Ag/mL) at 37jC

or via treatment with the chemical compound 2ME2. A, AGS cells stably
expressing siRNA against HIF-1a (KD ) or scrambled control siRNA (SCR ) were
cultivated for 16 h under normoxia (N ) or hypoxia (H ), and HIF-1a protein
levels were analyzed in nuclear extracts by Western blot analysis, with YY1
serving as nuclear loading control. AGS KD cells were unable to express HIF-1a
protein under hypoxic culture. B, expression of HIF-1 target genes PGK1
and CA IX was determined by Western blot of total cell lysates, with h-actin
serving as cytoplasmic loading control. AGS KD and SCR cells were subjected
for 24 h to either normoxia or hypoxia. Inhibition of HIF-1a protein by RNAi
resulted in decreased expression of HIF-1 target genes PGK1 and CA IX in
AGS KD cells under hypoxic conditions. C, confirmation of loss of HIF-1a
function by HRE-luciferase reporter assay. AGS KD and SCR cells were
cotransfected with a HRE-luc reporter and phRL-null Renilla as an internal
control and incubated under either normoxia or hypoxia for 24 h. Inhibition of
HIF-1a resulted in a significant decrease of HRE-luc reporter activity under
hypoxic conditions (***, P < 0.0001; unpaired Student’s t test). Luciferase
activity, normalized to Renilla luciferase activity, was expressed relative to that of
transfected control cells (SCR ) under normoxia, set at 1.0. Results shown are
representative of three independent experiments; columns, mean of triplicate
determinations; bars, SE. D, AGS WT cells were treated for 24 h with increasing
concentrations of 2ME2 and inhibition of HIF-1a was analyzed by Western blot
analysis (top ) and HRE-luc reporter assay (bottom ). Treatment with 2ME2 led to
a dose-dependent reduction of HIF-1a protein and in agreement to a significant
decrease of HRE-luc reporter activity under hypoxia (**, P = 0.0035; *, P = 0.036;
unpaired Student’s t test).

measured on a FACSCalibur to quantitate J-aggregate formation.
Quantitation of active caspase-3. Active caspase-3 was quantified by
flow cytometry using an Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated antibody against the
cleaved form of caspase-3 (9669; Cell Signaling Technology) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.
Anoikis protection assay. Cells (2.5  105) were seeded in 6-well plates,
allowed to adhere, and pretreated with 10 Amol/L 2ME2 for 24 h.
Subsequently, 2.5  105 cells were replated onto either polyHEMA-coated
dishes or regular tissue culture ware in the presence or absence of a
function blocking a5 integrin antibody (clone P1D6; Chemicon) or mouse
immunoglobulin control antibody (Dako). After 16 h, anoikis was evaluated
based on the fraction of cells harboring active caspase-3.
Anchorage-independent growth assay. Anchorage-independent
growth was assessed by human tumor clonogenic assay as described
before (8). For determination of anchorage-independent growth in cells
treated with 2ME2, every third day, 2ME2 was added to the cells in the
indicated concentrations.
Immunocytochemical detection of A5 integrin. Cells grown onto
sterile coverslips were washed with PBS before fixation in acetone/
methanol (1:1) for 2 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice
with PBS, blocked for 20 min in PBS with 2% nonfat dried milk, washed
twice again, and were then incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody
to human a5 integrin (Abcam) in 0.1% bovine serum albumin/PBS
overnight at 4jC. Cells were washed four times in PBS before incubation
with a goat anti mouse Cy3 antibody (1 h at room temperature) followed
by 2 additional washes with PBS and final fixation in ethanol. Cells were
mounted in Elvanol and immunofluorescence was evaluated on a Zeiss
Axioskop.

software (GraphPad Software). Statistical significance was determined by
two-tailed Student’s t test for unpaired or paired observations (P < 0.05).

Results and Discussion
Robust metastatic proficiency is a hallmark of human gastric
carcinomas and the clinical outcome of gastric cancer patients is
critically determined by the extent of local invasion and systemic
dissemination. Invasiveness in turn was found associated with
HIF-1a expression via analysis of gastric cancer specimens by us
and other investigators (9).5 In view of this background, we chose
AGS and MKN28 human gastric cancer cell lines as suitable cell
models to study the role of HIF-1a in cellular processes that
promote metastasis. To achieve sound functional inactivation of
HIF-1a in vitro, we constructed a lentiviral RNA interference
system. AGS and MKN28 cells stably expressing either siRNA
specifically targeting HIF-1a (knockdown, ‘‘KD’’) or unspecific
control siRNA (scrambled, ‘‘SCR’’) were generated by lentiviral
transduction. This approach yielded a highly efficient knockdown,
as Western blot analysis showed a near complete failure of AGS KD
cells to induce HIF-1a protein under hypoxic conditions (Supplementary Fig. S1A; Fig. 1A). Furthermore, functional inactivation of
HIF-1a was achieved in AGS KD cells as shown by greatly reduced
protein expression of HIF-1a target genes carbonic anhydrase IX
(CA IX) and phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1; Fig. 1B) and a
significant reduction of a luciferase reporter plasmid driven by

hypoxia-responsive elements (HRE) under hypoxic conditions
(Fig. 1C). In a complementary pharmacologic approach, HIF-1a
protein induction and transcriptional activity were inhibited by the
compound 2ME2. Exposure of AGS cells to 2ME2 reduced the levels
of nuclear HIF-1a protein under hypoxia in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 1D, top). As a consequence, hypoxia-induced
transcriptional activity of HIF-1a was suppressed by 2ME2 with
comparable dose dependency (Fig. 1D, bottom). Taken together,
these results show that HIF-1a could be functionally inactivated
either by means of a lentivirus-based siRNA system or via
treatment with the chemical compound 2ME2.
In our initial biological characterization of HIF-1a–deficient AGS
and MKN28 cells, proliferation and viability were not different from
SCR control cells.4 However, a distinct reduction of migration and

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (24). December 15, 2008

invasion capacity was noted.5 Both migration and invasion rely on
the dynamic and controlled interaction with the extracellular
matrix (ECM) environment and are crucially regulated by the
integrin family of large glycoproteins. Integrins function as
transmembrane receptors that mediate cell adhesion to ECM and
participate in signal transduction (10). Besides migration and
adhesion, integrins are centrally involved in the regulation of other
protumorigenic processes such as angiogenesis and metastasis
(10). Changes in integrin expression frequently occur in the context
of malignant transformation and have furthermore been linked to
the metastatic phenotype, although individual integrins may
function as promotors or suppressors of tumor progression.
Interestingly, hypoxia has been shown to induce integrins on
a variety of human cancer cell lines in vitro (11–13). In line with
these findings, inhibition of HIF-1a resulted in down-regulation
of h1 integrin on pancreatic cancer cells (14). Accordingly,
we compared the surface presentation of a panel of integrins in
HIF-1a–competent and HIF-1a–deficient AGS cells by flow
cytometry (Supplementary Fig. S2). Overall integrin expression
was comparable in AGS wild-type (WT) and AGS SCR cells,
confirming that the lentiviral infection per se had not changed
integrin expression. In contrast, a significant and selective
induction of a5 integrin was apparent on the surface of AGS KD
cells (Fig. 2A). The a5 subunit represents the limiting constituent of
the fibronectin receptor, a5h1 integrin, and a highly attractive
candidate target of HIF-1a regulation. Thus, we went on and
corroborated the increased content of a5 integrin in AGS KD cells
by immunoblotting experiments (Fig. 2B). Immunfluorescence
microscopy revealed punctuate a5 fluorescence throughout the
area of substrate attachment in SCR control cells. This pattern was
similarly observed in AGS KD cells, which furthermore displayed
intense membrane staining, consistent with a more abundant
presentation of a5 integrin at the surface of HIF-1a–deficient AGS
cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). A subsequent quantitative analysis of
a5 integrin mRNA levels by real-time PCR documented a
pronounced increase in AGS KD cells, indicating that a5 integrin
induction occurred at the level of transcription (Fig. 2C).
To obtain independent evidence for the proposed HIF1a–dependent regulation of a5h1 integrin, 2ME2 was added
to AGS WT cells for pharmacologic inhibition of HIF-1a (Fig. 2D).
Indeed, 2ME2 treatment resulted in a dose-dependent induction of
a5 integrin presentation at the concentrations that were required
to inhibit HRE reporter gene activity (please compare to Fig. 1D),
consistent with a reduction of HIF-1a activity underlying integrin
regulation. Thus, pharmacologic inhibition of HIF-1a confirmed its
capacity to control the cellular a5 integrin complement.
Next, we aimed at identifying the molecular mechanism
controlling the up-regulation of a5 integrin upon loss of HIF-1a.
Integrin expression is regulated by numerous signaling pathways,
consistent with the need to flexibly adjust the communication
interface with the cellular surrounding. In this context, the level of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) constitutes an intriguing intersection
of integrin regulatory and HIF-1a effector pathways. ROS (including
superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, singlet oxygen, and hydroxyl
radicals) are natural byproducts of aerobic cellular metabolism. ROS
are considered to be involved in carcinogenesis and act as important
regulators of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration (15). They
were shown to modulate mRNA expression of different integrin
subunits in mammary epithelial cells (16). More specifically,
increased a5 integrin expression of AGS cells upon colonization
with Helicobacter pylori was reported to occur via elevated

intracellular ROS (17). To determine whether intracellular ROS levels
contributed to a5 integrin induction in HIF-1a deficient cells, AGS
KD cells were treated with the flavoprotein inhibitor DPI. DPI has
long been characterized as an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I,
both in vitro and in vivo (18). The vast majority of intracellular ROS
are being produced by the mitochondrial electron transport chain
(19). Here, complex I and complex III represent the major sites of
ROS generation (19). Remarkably, treatment with DPI for 24 hours
completely blocked the induction of a5 integrin on the surface and
a5 integrin mRNA levels in HIF-1a–deficient AGS cells (Fig. 3A and
B). This definite result strongly suggested elevated intracellular ROS
levels as the molecular mediators of a5 integrin up-regulation upon
loss of HIF-1a. To establish the causal role of HIF-1a for the redox
potential of AGS cells, intracellular ROS levels were determined in
AGS KD and SCR cells by flow cytometry. Cells were incubated with
the nonfluorescent compound DHE, which in the presence of
superoxide anions is oxidized to the fluorescent hydroethidium. We
found that the intracellular superoxide levels in AGS KD cells were 2fold higher than those in AGS SCR cells (Fig. 3C), indicating that
functional inactivation of HIF-1a in AGS cells resulted in significant
and functional elevation of intracellular oxidative stress. These
results are well in line with recent reports demonstrating either
increased ROS levels in normoxic HIF-1a deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts or reduced ROS in renal cancer cells harboring
constitutive HIF–1a expression due to mutation of the von Hippel-

Lindau tumor suppressor (20, 21). As mitochondria represent the
prime source of intracellular ROS, HIF-1a activity may counteract
ROS production via regulatory functions at the mitochondrial level.
These include (a) incremental reduction of mitochondrial activity
due to enhanced use of glycolysis even under conditions of sufficient
oxygen availability (the Warbug effect; refs. 22, 23), (b) inhibition of
pyruvate shuttling into the mitochondria (24) by the HIF-1 target
gene pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1, which blocks mitochondrial
pyruvate entry via inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (25), and
(c) direct inhibition of mitochondrial biogenesis, as was shown in
renal cancer cells (21). Our analysis of human gastric cancer cells
clearly showed elevated levels of ROS upon inactivation of HIF-1a
and is therefore well in line with the above outlined pathway.
Furthermore, our functional link between ROS and a5 integrin
expression suggests that HIF-1–mediated suppression of ROS may
constitute a critical pathway with respect to the acquisition of
invasive and metastatic properties.
In the context of tumor biology, reduced a5h1 expression was
reported in many human tumors including breast and colonic
cancer cells (26, 27). Furthermore, experimental overexpression
of a5h1 suppressed tumorigenicity of Chinese hamster ovary
or human colonic carcinoma cells, suggesting a5h1 functions
as a tumor suppressor (26, 28). Consistent with this notion,
ras-transformed cells present a reduction of a5h1 integrin
expression and conversely, reconstitution of the tumor suppressor

p16 increased the cellular a5h1 complement (8). However, a5h1
may to some extent support tumor growth. For instance, impaired
vascularisation was noted in xenograft tumors derived from a5deficient cells, suggesting that tumor cell derived a5h1 may
promote tumor growth by orchestrating tumor-associated angiogenesis (29). When bound to ECM components, a5h1 integrin
cooperates with growth factors to activate mitogenic and
antiapoptotic signaling pathways. In contrast, loss of matrix
contact generates proapoptotic signals reminiscent of death
receptor activation. In consequence, epithelial cells that lack
appropriate ECM contacts undergo a specific form of apoptosis
called ‘‘anoikis’’ (30). Anoikis thus represents a central safeguard
mechanism to preclude survival of epithelial cells in inappropriate
locations. Importantly, the tumor suppressor function of the
fibronectin receptor a5h1 integrin in epithelial cells has been
linked to its ability to induce anoikis (31).
Therefore, we next compared the apoptosis fraction of HIF1a–competent and HIF-1a–deficient AGS cells in either adherent
cultures or after suspension culture on polyHEMA-coated dishes
(anoikis conditions). The functional inactivation of HIF-1a did not

caspase-3 activity assays (Supplementary Fig. S4). In contrast, a
marked difference in anoikis susceptibility was evident from the
pre-G1 fraction of cell cycle analysis, with a significantly increased
anoikis fraction present in HIF-1a–deficient AGS KD cells (Fig. 4A).
This difference in anoikis susceptibility was additionally confirmed
and quantitated using JC-1, an early and sensitive marker of
apoptosis, which reflects the integrity of the mitochondrial
membrane potential (Fig. 4B, left).
To provide further support for the functional link between
HIF-1a and anoikis, we used complementary pharmacologic
approaches to test whether (a) inhibition of a5 integrin induction
by DPI could revert the anoikis susceptible phenotype of AGS KD
cells, or (b) conversely, suppression of HIF-1a activity by 2ME2 could
sensitize AGS WT cells to anoikis. First, AGS KD cells
were treated for 24 hours with DPI and subjected to apoptosis
detection. As shown in Fig. 4B (right), the inhibition of ROS
production by DPI rescued AGS KD cells from anoikis, demonstrating a pivotal role of ROS for the anoikis susceptible phenotype of
HIF-1a–deficient gastric cancer cells. Second, we examined anoikis
in AGS WT cells that were pretreated with 2ME2 (Fig. 4C). To avoid
confounding toxic effects of prolonged 2ME2 treatment, we focused
our analysis on early apoptosis induction using the mitochondrial
membrane integrity and the presence of active caspase-3 as two
independent approaches for quantitative determination of early
apoptotic cells. Both variables revealed a significant induction of
anoikis in 2ME2-treated cells, confirming enhanced susceptibility to
anoikis after functional inactivation of HIF-1a (Fig. 4C).
This experimental approach was then exploited to address the
functional relevance of a5 integrin for anoikis induction after
pharmacologic inhibition of HIF-1a (Fig. 4D). AGS cells were
pretreated with 2ME2 and exposed to anoikis conditions either in
the absence or in the presence of an antibody to a5 integrin, and
anoikis induction was determined based on the abundance of
active caspase-3. Antibody treatment profoundly reduced 2ME2induced anoikis almost to control levels, confirming a requirement
for a5 integrin. This is in excellent agreement with the ability of
DPI to reverse both, a5 integrin induction and anoikis in AGS KD
cells, and firmly supports a functional role of a5 integrin in
HIF-1a–dependent control of anchorage dependence.
Anchorage-independent survival has a major effect on tumorigenicity in vivo, a feature that is modeled in vitro by colony formation
in agar suspension. Accordingly, we subjected HIF-1a–competent
and HIF-1a–deficient AGS cells to culture in soft agar and monitored
colony formation (Fig. 5). Compared with AGS SCR control cells,
colony formation of AGS KD cells was profoundly suppressed and
remaining colonies were notably smaller in size (Fig. 5A). Similarly,
treatment of AGS WT cells with 2ME2 led to a dose-dependent
suppression of colony formation over the concentration range
required for HIF-1a functional inhibition (Fig. 5B). These results are
in line with an earlier report that overexpression of HIF-1a in
transformed melanocytes lead to an increase in the number of
colonies in soft agar (32). Furthermore, anchorage-independent
growth of human colon cancer cell lines has been shown to be
reduced after functional inactivation of HIF-1a (33). However, the
latter study also reported a growth defect of HIF-1a–deficient cells
under anchorage-dependent growth conditions, raising the possibility that reduced colony formation resulted from cell cycle arrest
rather than apoptosis induction. In sharp contrast, the anchoragedependent proliferation of the gastric carcinoma cells used in the
current study was not at all affected by knockdown of HIF-1a.
Moreover, AGS cells displayed little spontaneous apoptosis under

Figure 6. Inhibition of HIF-1a in MKN28 gastric cancer cells. A, inactivation of HIF-1a by RNA interference was analyzed by Western blot analysis of HIF-1a (left) and
HIF-1 target genes PGK1 and CA IX (right ). HIF-1a protein and HIF-1 target genes PGK and CA IX were markedly decreased in MKN28 KD cells under hypoxic
conditions. B, loss of HIF-1a function was confirmed by HRE-luc reporter assay. Columns, mean of three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate; bars,
SE (**, P = 0.0012; unpaired Student’s t test). RNA interference against HIF-1a resulted in a significant decrease of HRE-luc reporter activity under hypoxic conditions.
C, a5 integrin expression in MKN28 KD and SCR cells was determined by FACS analysis (left) and by quantitative real-time PCR (right ). Inactivation of HIF-1a by RNAi
resulted in an increase of a5 integrin on the surface (left ) and a5 mRNA (right ). Left , a representative histogram. Right , transcription levels of a5 integrin were analyzed
relative to h-actin. Columns, mean (**, P = 0.0096; unpaired Student’s t test); bars, SE. D, anchorage-independent growth of MKN28 KD and SCR cells was
examined using a soft agar colony formation assay under normoxic conditions. Columns, mean of a representative of three experiments, each performed in

anchorage-dependent growth conditions, and these low apoptosis
rates were not influenced by HIF-1a inhibition (Supplementary Fig.
S4). Hence, our results constitute the first report about a permissive
role of HIF-1a for tumor cell survival under anchorage-independent
conditions in normoxic microenvironments.
To extend these findings to other gastric cancer cells, key
observations were confirmed in MKN28 cells. Characterization of
the RNA interference against HIF-1a in this cell line is provided in
Fig. 6. MKN28 KD cells showed a complete loss of HIF-1a protein
expression under hypoxic conditions and a significant decrease in
transcriptional activity of HIF-1a as determined by target protein
expression and HRE-luciferase activity (Supplementary Fig. S1B;
Fig. 6A and B). In good agreement with our observations on AGS
cells, MKN28 KD cells induced surface a5 integrin expression and
a5 integrin mRNA levels (Fig. 6C) and displayed a significant
inhibition of colony formation in soft agar (Fig. 6D), indicating that
the HIF-1a–dependent control of anchorage-independent growth
is not restricted to the AGS cell system.

In summary, the herewith presented experiments argue for a
central role of HIF-1a in the control of anoikis via suppression of
a5 integrin. The exploration of HIF-1a–inhibiting compounds in
clinical studies of gastric cancer might inaugurate efficient and
novel treatment regimes for this fatal disease.
