Abstract
Nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs such as sulindac inhibit Wnt signaling, which is critical to maintain
cancer stem cell–like cells (CSC), but they also suppress the activity of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) at clinically feasible
concentrations. Recently, 5-LO was shown to be critical to maintain CSC in a model of chronic myeloid leukemia.
For these reasons, we hypothesized that 5-LO may offer a therapeutic target to improve the management
of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), an aggressive disease driven by CSCs. Pharmacologic and genetic
approaches were used to evaluate the effects of 5-LO blockade in a PML/RARa-positive model of AML.
As CSC models, we used Sca-1þ/lin murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC), which were
retrovirally transduced with PML/RARa. We found that pharmacologic inhibition of 5-LO interfered strongly
with the aberrant stem cell capacity of PML/RARa-expressing HSPCs. Through small-molecule inhibitor
studies and genetic disruption of 5-LO, we also found that Wnt and CSC inhibition is mediated by the
enzymatically inactive form of 5-LO, which hinders nuclear translocation of b-catenin. Overall, our ﬁndings
revealed that 5-LO inhibitors also inhibit Wnt signaling, not due to the interruption of 5-LO–mediated lipid
signaling but rather due to the generation of a catalytically inactive form of 5-LO, which assumes a new
function. Given the evidence that CSCs mediate AML relapse after remission, eradication of CSCs in this
setting by 5-LO inhibition may offer a new clinical approach for immediate evaluation in patients with AML.

Introduction
Actually, one of the major clinical challenges in oncology is
to target the cancer stem cell–like cells (CSC). Current therapeutic strategies, regardless of conventional cytotoxic or
novel molecular approaches, often fail to eradicate cancer
completely because they are unable to efﬁciently target CSCs.
In this respect, a key signaling pathway for the maintenance
of CSCs in many cancers, including colorectal, breast, and
pancreatic cancer, is the Wnt signaling pathway (1–4).

In acute and chronic myeloid leukemias (AML and CML) the
role of the Wnt signaling activation for the pathogenesis and
the maintenance of the CSCs is well understood (5–7). The fact
that in leukemia inhibition of the Wnt signaling directly targets
the CSCs (leukemic stem cell, LSC) means that compounds and
related signaling pathways that are able to inhibit Wnt signaling offer considerable potential within the setting of maintenance therapy of leukemia. Deregulated activation of the
Wnt signaling leads to aberrant self-renewal of the LSCs in
AML and CML and is fundamental to its maintenance (7–9).
The activation of Wnt signaling in leukemia is mainly due to
either a direct deregulation of key effectors such as APC, Axin,
b-catenin, g-catenin, or TCF/Lef by, i.e., mutations, or functional inhibition of their key regulators by leukemia-associated
fusion proteins (LAFP), including PML/RARa, AML-1/ETO,
MLL/AF9, or BCR/ABL. These LAFPs are generated by chromosomal translocations such as t(15;17) (PML/RARa), t(8;21)
(AML-1/ETO), t(9;11)(MLL/AF9), or t(9;22) (BCR/ABL; refs. 6,
7, 10–12). The aberrant self-renewal of the LSCs depends on the
aberrant activation of Wnt signaling by the LAFPs (6, 7, 10). The
overexpression of g-catenin, one of the key players in Wnt
signaling in HSPCs, leads to the induction of leukemia in vivo
(12).
Nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAID) developed
as COX-1/2 inhibitors are efﬁcient Wnt signaling inhibitors

5-Lipoxygenase and Leukemic Stem Cells

(13–15). Therefore, compounds such as sulindac, indomethacin, or ibuprofen have been employed in therapeutic
approaches to stem cell therapy in models of AML and CML
(6, 16). In fact, sulindac inhibits aberrant stem cell capacity
induced by PML/RARa or PLZF/RARa (X-RARa) in human as
well as in primary murine HSPCs. Sulindac targets both
b-catenin and g-catenin in X-RAR–expressing progenitor cells
(16), whereas indomethacin is effective in the model of MLL/
AF9-induced AML (6).
However, for targeting Wnt signaling and stem cell activity
in AML or CML models, NSAID concentrations were required
that highly exceeded those sufﬁcient for COX-1/2 inhibition
(5, 6, 16). This calls into question whether NSAIDs target COX1/2 to inhibit Wnt signaling in AML and CML or whether
another player(s) is/are involved.
Recently, it has been shown that NSAIDs, such as sulindac or
celecoxib, which are capable of inhibiting Wnt signaling, also
suppress 5-LO activity. Interestingly, 5-LO–inhibitory concentrations were similar to those for suppression of Wnt signaling
and the aberrant self-renewal of LSCs (16, 17).
Together with COX-1/2, 5-LO is a key enzyme in arachidonic
acid (AA) metabolism. 5-LO is crucial for the synthesis of
proinﬂammatory leukotrienes. Initial evidence for a role of
5-LO in the regulation of LSC activity was provided by the
ﬁnding that 5-LO activity is indispensable for the induction of
a CML-like disease by BCR/ABL in vivo. Both genetic targeting
of 5-LO in Alox/ mice and pharmacologic targeting by a
selective 5-LO inhibitor abolished the leukemogenic potential
of BCR/ABL. In this model, 5-LO has been identiﬁed as a critical
regulator of LSCs in CML-like disease (18). In the present work,
we investigated (i) whether effects of 5-LO targeting of LSCs in
CML are extendible to the LSCs in AML, (ii) whether 5-LO is
involved in the regulation of Wnt signaling, to better understand how NSAIDs inhibit both Wnt signaling and the aberrant
self-renewal of LSCs in AML and CML; and (iii) whether and
how 5-LO represents a novel target for stem cell therapy
approach in AML.

Materials and Methods
Plasmids
The retroviral vectors, PINCO- PML/RARa and PINCO-HAb-cateninS33A, as well as the expression vector, pCDNA3.15LO, have been described elsewhere (16). The TopFlash/FopFlash system and the Renilla luciferase pRL-TK construct
(Promega) have also been described previously (19). The
pGL3-g-catenin construct and the pGL3basic and pRL-cytomegalovirus (pRL-CMV) vectors were already described (12).
Cell lines and chemicals
293T, NB4, and THP-1 cells were obtained from German
Resource Centre for Biological Material. 293T cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco), supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum (FCS; Gibco). NB4, THP-1, and U937-PR9 cells were
maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FCS
(Gibco). The identity of these cells was routinely controlled by
immunodetection (immunoﬂuorescence or Western blotting)
of PML/RARa (NB4 and U937-PR9) or the induction of 5-LO
activity (THP-1) and the response to all-trans retinoic acid–

induced granulocytic differentiation (NB4), respectively. CJ13,610 was synthesized in-house (see Supplementary Materials
and Methods) and calcium ionophore A23187, arachidonic
acid, zileuton, indomethacin, and diclofenac were purchased
from Sigma–Aldrich. The sEH inhibitor trans-4-[4-(3-adamantan-1-ylureido) cyclohexyloxy]-benzoic acid (t-AUCB) 1 was
kindly provided by Bruce Hammock (University of California at
Davis, Davis, CA).
Isolation of Sca1þ/lin hematopoietic stem and
progenitor cells
Sca1þ/lin HSPCs were isolated from either 8- to 12-weekold female C57BL/6N mice (Janvier) or male and female
B6.129S2-Alox5tm1Fun/J (Jackson Laboratory) and B6.129XEphx2tm1Gonz/J mice (provided by Frank Gonzalez, NIH,
Bethesda, MD) after killing by CO2 asphyxiation. The isolation
of Sca1þ/lin cells was performed as described previously (20).
Two days after the isolation cells were retrovirally transfected.
Retroviral infection
Ecotropic Phoenix packaging cells were transfected with
PINCO-PML/RARa or empty vector by calcium phosphate
precipitation according to widely established protocols. Retroviral supernatant was collected at days 2 and 3 after transfection. Infection of the target cells was performed as described
previously (12). The minimal accepted infection efﬁciency was
70%, as assessed by the detection of GFP-positive cells by FACS.
Differences in the infection efﬁciency between samples did not
exceed 10%.
Determination of 5-LO product formation in THP-1 and
Sca1þ/lin cells
To induce 5-LO expression, differentiation of THP-1 or
transduced Sca1þ/lin cells were either induced by the addition of TGFb1 (1 ng/mL) and 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (50
nmol/L) or by addition of GM-/G-CSF (20 ng/mL, 60 ng/mL;
Cell Concepts) for 4 days. Determination of 5-LO product
formation was performed as previously described (21). For
Sca1þ/lin cells, leukotriene formation in the supernatant was
measured with a LTB4-ELISA, according to the manufacturer's
instructions (Enzo Life Science). 5-LO product formations of
CJ-13,610-, zileuton-, and sulindac-treated THP-1 cells were
analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
as described previously (22). For indomethacin, leukotriene
levels in the supernatant were analyzed by liquid chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) as described
previously (23). 5-LO product formation included 5-HETE for
CJ-13,610 and sulindac and LTB4 for indomethacin.
Immunohistochemistry
The spleens were embedded in parafﬁn blocks according to
a conventional tissue processing procedure. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 5 mm sections of each parafﬁn
block. The sections were deparafﬁnized with xylol (Sigma) and
rehydrated through graded alcohol series (100%, 95%, 80%,
50%, H2O). Antigen unmasking was achieved through heating
(95 C) with 0.25 mmol/L EDTA buffer for 50 minutes. The
endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked using 3%

hydrogen peroxide (5 minutes, room temperature), followed by
preincubation with antibody mix (TBS, 2% BSA, 2% normal
goat serum, 0.02% Tween 20) for 20 minutes at room
temperature. The primary antibody (mouse monoclonal
anti–b-catenin; BD Biosciences) and biotinylated isolectin
B4 (dilution 1/25; Sigma) were diluted in the antibody mix.
This antibody mixture was applied and samples were then
incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. After washing with
TBS, the secondary antibody (DAKO Envision Dual-Link System HRP; DAKO) was added and samples were further incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. DAKO AEC-high
sensitivity substrate chromogen was applied for 15 minutes
and after intense washing with H2O, slides were counterstained
with hematoxylin (Sigma) for 15 seconds and washed under
running H2O. Immunohistomount (Santa Cruz Biotechnology
Inc.) was used for mounting.
Competitive repopulation assay
The competitive repopulation assay (CRA) was based on the
CD45.1-CD45.2 chimerism of C57BL/6N mice, as described
previously (24). CD45.2þ/Sca1þ/lin were retrovirally transduced and cultivated in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS
(Gibco), mIL6, mSCF, and mIL3 upon exposure of either 0.001%
DMSO, 0.3 mmol/L, and 3 mmol/L CJ-13,610 for 7 days. A total of
1  104 CD45.2þ/Sca1þ/lin cells were injected into lethally (11
Gy) irradiated CD45.1þ and CD45.2þ female recipients
(B6DJLF1/JRj; Janvier) together with 5  105 normal Ly5.1þ
bone marrow (BM) cells. The proportion of CD45.2þ donor
cell–derived hematopoietic cells was determined by FACS
analysis of cells from the peripheral blood or spleen. The cells
were stained with conjugated monoclonal antibodies speciﬁc
for CD45.1 and CD45.2 or unstained control (Miltenyi Biotec).
Transactivation assays
pCDNA3 or pC3-5LO expression plasmids were either
cotransfected with pRT-LK, pGL3-OT, or pGL3-OF or pGL3g-catenin, pGL3-basic, and pRT-CMV into U937-PR9 cells by
nucleofection according to the manufacturer's instructions
(Nucleofector Kit C, Lonza). Two hours later, transgene expression was induced by the exposure of the cells to 100 mmol/L
ZnSO4 (Sigma) as described (25). Twenty-four hours after Zn2þ

treatment, luciferase activity was determined using the DualLuciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) accordingly and
all assays were normalized to cotransfected Renilla activity.
Immunoﬂuorescence
Cells were applied on positively charged coverslips (MenzelGl€aser), washed with TBS (10 mmol/L Tris-HCl pH 8, 150
mmol/L NaCl) and ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Applichem)
for 30 minutes followed by blocking and permeabilization with
5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk (Roth) and 0.2% Triton X-100 (Roth)
for 30 to 45 minutes. Cells were incubated with monoclonal
anti–5-LO (BD Biosciences), polyclonal anti–b-catenin (clone
H102; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), and polyclonal antiRARa (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) antibodies, respectively.
After extensive washing in TBS, cells were stained with Alexa
Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse or Alexa Fluor 594conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig antibodies (Invitrogen). Nucleus
staining was obtained using TO-PRO 3 (Invitrogen). The coverslips were mounted with Moviol (Sigma). Images were
acquired by a Leica TCS-SP5 confocal microscope (Leica)
under identical conditions for pinhole opening, laser power,
photomultiplier tension, and layer number. During data elaboration by Fiji software (www.ﬁji.sc), identical parameters
were applied for all samples.
Statistical analysis
Statistical signiﬁcance was determined using one-way
ANOVA with Bonferroni posttest using GraphPad Prism 5.0
(GraphPad).

Results
5-LO is inhibited by NSAIDs and is expressed in normal
and malignant hematopoietic stem cell compartments
Some NSAIDs, such as sulindac, indomethacin, or celecoxib,
are able to inhibit Wnt signaling, but only at high concentrations, exceeding those for the suppression of COX-1/2 (Table 1;
refs. 6, 7, 13–16, 26–29). It has recently been shown that
sulindac sulﬁde (active metabolite of sulindac) is able to inhibit
5-LO at clinically relevant concentrations (17). Therefore, we
investigated whether other NSAIDs such as indomethacin are
able to inhibit 5-LO. Monocytic THP-1 cells, known to express

5-Lipoxygenase and Leukemic Stem Cells

5-LO and to have inducible 5-LO activity (30), were preincubated with inhibitors. 5-LO product formation was induced by
exposure to Ca2þ ionophore A23187 (21). CJ-13,610, a selective
5-LO inhibitor, was used as a positive control. We found that
indomethacin was able to suppress 5-LO product formation in
a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Indomethacin
suppressed 5-LO activity at higher concentration as needed
for COX inhibition. (Fig. 1A). Noteworthy for both inhibitors,
indomethacin and sulindac sulﬁde, the 5-LO–inhibitory concentrations were similar to those required for suppression
of Wnt signaling and the aberrant self-renewal of LSCs
(16, 17). Therefore, we investigated the subpopulation of cells
that should be targeted in a "stem cell therapy" approach.
We studied 5-LO product formation in a highly enriched
Sca1þ/lin population to disclose whether 5-LO is expressed in
HSPCs. Differentiation was induced by GM/G-CSF. 5-LO activity was assessed by the formation of LTB4, by ELISA. Here, we
show for the ﬁrst time that the HSPC compartment not only
expressed 5-LO, but also exhibited 5-LO enzyme activity, which
was only slightly induced by the GM-CSF–induced differentiation process (Fig. 1B). These ﬁndings were conﬁrmed by
Western blot analysis of Sca1þ/lin HSPCs (data not shown).
Targeting 5-LO by selective inhibitors reduces the stem
cell capacity of PML/RARa-positive HSPCs
Because NSAID concentrations that are able to inhibit
aberrant LSC capacity lie within the range needed to suppress
5-LO, we speculated whether the effects of the NSAIDs on LSCs
are mediated by inhibition of 5-LO. Therefore, we studied the
effects of CJ-13,610, a potent and selective inhibitor of 5-LO, on
LSC capacity.
The effects of 5-LO inhibition on aberrant LSC capacity were
addressed in serial replating efﬁciency assays in PML/RARa-

positive Sca1þ/lin HSPCs. Serial replating revealed the combined effect of PML/RARa on proliferation, differentiation, and
self-renewal of HSPCs (12, 31). Therefore, we retrovirally
expressed PML/RARa in Sca1þ/lin, murine HSPCs and plated
them in semisolid medium supplemented with mIL3, mIL6,
and mSCF in the presence/absence of 0.3 and 3 mmol/L of CJ13,610 (Fig. 2A). Empty vector–transduced cells were used as
controls. Serial replatings were performed as graphically
described in Fig. 2A.
CJ-13,610 abolished the aberrant serial replating capacity
of PML/RARa-positive HSPCs at a concentration of 0.3
mmol/L, starting from the second plating (Fig. 2B). An effect
of the treatment was already seen at the ﬁrst plating, as
revealed by the modiﬁcations in the morphology of the
colonies in the presence of 3 mmol/L CJ-13,610 (Fig. 2C).
The rare colonies in the controls also disappeared upon
treatment (Fig. 2A).
In addition to the 5-LO and COX pathway, there is also a
third arachidonic acid pathway, CYP (cytochrome P450)/sEH
(soluble epoxide hydrolase) pathway, known to be involved in
Wnt signaling, proliferation, and mobilization of HSC (32). To
investigate the role of CYP/sEH in the effects of stem cell
suppression and to conﬁrm that only 5-LO inhibition is
responsible for the observed effects, we extended the treatment
of PML/RARa-positive Sca1þ/lin cells, to sulindac sulﬁde,
in COX-inhibitory concentrations, as well as to tAUCB,
an sEH inhibitor (Supplementary Fig. S1; ref. 33). In fact,
treatment with neither sulindac sulﬁde or tAUCB alone nor
in combination was able to suppress the replating efﬁciency of
PML/RARa. Only the presence of CJ-13,610 led to a complete
inhibition of the aberrant replating efﬁciency of PML/RARa
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Also, the genetic inhibition of sEH,
using murine Sca1þ/lin cells with a sEH/ background,

5-LO activation. Leukotriene formation was measured with LTB4-ELISA. Data are shown from a single representative experiment of two independent
experiments performed, which yielded similar results.

showed no effect on the replating efﬁciency of PML/RARaexpressing HSPCs (Supplementary Fig. S2).
In summary, these data indicate that the pharmacologic
inhibition of 5-LO is sufﬁcient to interfere with the aberrant
replating capacity of PML/RARa-positive HSPCs.
The abolition of the stem cell capacity of PML/RARapositive HSPCs by CJ-13,610 is accompanied by the
inhibition of Wnt signaling
CJ-13,610 not only inhibited serial replating capacity of
PML/RARa-positive but also inhibited colony formation of
empty vector–transduced HSPCs. Thus, we investigated
whether the inhibition of 5-LO generally suppresses stem
cells or only LSCs. First, we studied the effects of CJ-13,610
on short-term hematopoietic stem cells (ST-HSC) and early
immature progenitors in a colony-forming unit spleen day 12
(CFU-S12) assay (34). Therefore, Sca1þ/lin HSPCs were
retrovirally transduced with PML/RARa or with empty
vector and exposed in liquid culture to 0.3 or 3 mmol/L
CJ-13,610. After 7 days, cells were counted, harvested, and
inoculated into lethally irradiated mice (Fig. 3A). On day 12,
the mice were sacriﬁced, spleens were ﬁxed, and the spleen
colonies were counted. As reported in Fig. 3B, the exposure
to CJ-13,610 led to a concentration-dependent and signiﬁ-

5248

cant reduction of the number of spleen colonies expressing
PML/RARa. The exposure to 3 mmol/L CJ-13,610 almost
completely abolished these colonies (Fig. 3B and C). Interestingly, 3 mmol/L CJ-13,610 allowed the formation of a few
colonies in the controls, indicating that CJ-13,610 did not
exert stem cell toxicity (Fig. 3B).
To determine which stem cell compartment is targeted
by CJ-13,610, we studied its effects on the frequency of
short-term (ST) and long-term (LT) HSC in a CRA. In this
assay, the ST-HSC population was detected at 12 weeks (Fig.
3F, left) and the LT-HSC population after 6 months (Fig. 3F,
right). Therefore, Sca1þ/lin HSPCs were retrovirally transduced with PML/RARa or with empty vector and exposed in
liquid culture to 0.3 or 3 mmol/L CJ-13,610. After 7 days, cells
were counted, harvested, and inoculated into lethally irradiated mice (Fig. 3E). As shown in Fig. 3F, exposure to CJ13,610 led to a reduction of both ST- and LT-HSC, as
revealed by the percentage of CD45.2þ cells, with respect
to untreated controls at 12 weeks and 6 months, respectively (Fig. 3F). Treatment of control cells led to a higher
frequency of ST- and LT-HSCs, conﬁrming that targeting of
5-LO is not stem cell toxic. Very similar results were
obtained using another selective 5-LO inhibitor, zileuton
(Supplementary Fig. S3).

(4–5 mice/group). An analysis of donor chimerism was performed at 12 weeks and 6 months after transplantation. The plots show a representative
donor-derived chimerism in (left) peripheral blood after 12 weeks and (right) spleen after 6 months from an individual mouse.

Interestingly, the effects of CJ-13,610 were not related to the
induction of apoptosis, excluding a cytotoxic effect of the 5-LO
inhibitor (data not shown).
The effects of NSAIDs on cancer stem cells are mainly
attributed to an inhibitory activity on b-catenin and the Wnt
signaling. Therefore, we investigated whether suppression of
the PML/RARa-induced aberrant stem cell capacity by CJ13,610 was related to an inhibitory effect on b-catenin and Wnt
signaling. Thus, we performed immunohistochemical staining
of the spleen colonies induced by PML/RARa, using an antibody raised against human b-catenin (Fig. 3D). To conﬁrm the
speciﬁcity of the b-catenin staining, we used an unstained
control, only incubated with the secondary antibody. PML/
RARa activation of Wnt signaling was reversed by CJ-13,610. As
shown in Fig. 3D, spleen colonies derived from PML/RARa-

positive HSPCs exposed to solvent exhibited a strong b-catenin
signal (red staining) in comparison with controls and colonies
derived from PML/RARa-positive HSPCs treated with CJ13,610. To conﬁrm these data, we performed real-time quantitative PCR analysis of the expression of the direct Wnt target
genes Axin 2 and Cyclin D1 in the PML/RARa-positive cell line
NB4 after treatment with 3 mmol/L CJ-13,610. As a control for
Wnt signaling inhibition, we used indomethacin. We could
observe that treatment with CJ-13,610 led clearly to a reduction
of mRNA expression levels of Axin 2 as well as cyclin D1
(Supplementary Fig. S4).
Taken together, these data demonstrate a selective effect of
CJ-13,610 on the LSC compartment, accompanied by the
inhibition of Wnt signaling without toxicity to the normal
hematopoietic stem cell compartment.

Loss of 5-LO expression does not recapitulate the
inhibitory effects of the inhibitors on the leukemic
phenotype by PML/RARa
To further investigate the role of 5-LO in the maintenance of
normal and leukemic stem cells, we investigated the effect of
targeted genetic inhibition of 5-LO on leukemogenic potential
and the aberrant stem cell capacity induced by PML/RARa in
Alox5/ mice (35). PML/RARa was retrovirally expressed in
Sca1þ/lin, Alox5/ and Alox5þ/þ HSPCs, respectively. First,
we performed serial replating assays. As shown in Fig. 4A, the
loss of 5-LO expression not only failed to inhibit the replating
efﬁciency of PML/RARa-expressing HSPCs, but also led to
increased proliferation of colony-forming cells, as revealed by
an increased number of colonies in comparison with Alox5þ/þ
controls expressing PML/RARa (Fig. 4 A and B).
Next, we tested the LT-HSC capacity of Alox5/ and
Alox5þ/þ HSPCs expressing PML/RARa in a CRA. Alox5/
and Alox5þ/þ HSPCs did not show signiﬁcant differences
in the frequency of the PML/RARa-positive LT stem cell
population (CD45.1þ), as revealed 9 months after transplantation into lethally irradiated recipient mice (CD45.1 and
2 population; Fig. 4C).
Taken together, these data show that loss of 5-LO expression
does not interfere with the replating efﬁciency and LT stem cell
capacity of PML/RARa-positive HSPCs. The data strongly

/

/

suggest that stem cell inhibition may be mediated by the
inhibited/inactive form of 5-LO, indicating a pathophysiologically relevant difference between enzymatically active and
inactive 5-LO.
Coexpression of catalytically inactive 5-LO inhibits the
PML/RARa-induced activation of Wnt signaling in
human leukemic U937 cells
Assuming that the catalytically inactive form of 5-LO is
responsible for stem cell inactivation, it should, like the
NSAIDs, also inhibit Wnt signaling. Therefore, we investigated
activation of Wnt signaling in a cellular model in the absence
and presence of 5-LO. We took advantage of the fact that PR9
cells, promonocytic U937 cells expressing PML/RARa under
the control of the Zn2þ-inducible methallothionein1 (MT-1)
promoter do not express endogenous 5-LO due to the methylation of the 5-LO promoter (36). PML/RARa activates Wnt
signaling in these cells through the activation of b-catenin and
g-catenin (10, 12). The lack of 5-LO expression in both control
and P/R9 cells was conﬁrmed by Western blotting and by PCR
(data not shown). Noteworthy, transfected 5-LO is unable to
synthesize leukotrienes in undifferentiated U937 cells (37).
This may relate to cell type–speciﬁc features governing 5-LO
activity, such as the redox state, the phosphorylation status of
5-LO, the activity of intracellular tyrosine kinases, structural

characteristics in the cytoskeleton, and the individual expression of further enzymes involved in leukotriene biosynthesis
(38). Notably, in myeloid cells, the activity of 5-LO was already
reported by us to depend on the differentiation status and the
activity of cellular peroxidases, which may also be true in 5-LO–
transfected U937 cells (22). We expressed 5-LO in these cells
under the control of a CMV promoter. Activation of Wnt
signaling by PML/RARa was addressed by the transactivation
of the "Topﬂash/Fopﬂash" reporter system, in which the
activation of the reporter is under the control of a TCF/LEF
responsive element (19). Here we show that the expression of 5LO prevented the activation of the Wnt target promoter by
PML/RARa (Fig. 5A).
To further understand the mechanism by which 5-LO suppresses Wnt signaling, we investigated the effect of 5-LO on
g-catenin–dependent transactivation. b- and g-catenin are
closely related and are both key mediators of Wnt signaling.
In contrast to b-catenin, which exhibits transforming potential
only upon constitutive stabilization by mutations, the overexpression of g-catenin alone is able to transform cells (39). We
used a construct in which the luciferase reporter was controlled by the g-catenin promoter, which is activated by
g-catenin itself (12). As reported in Fig. 5B, only a slight
reduction of the transactivation of g-catenin promoter by
PML/RARa was seen in the presence of 5-LO (Fig. 5B). In
summary, these results suggest that 5-LO interferes with the
PML/RARa-induced activation of Wnt signaling by inhibiting
b-catenin- and not g-catenin–dependent transactivation. This
ability is mediated by inactive 5-LO.
5-LO and b-catenin show a direct interaction
To test the possibility of a direct inﬂuence of 5-LO on Wnt
signaling, we investigated the interaction between 5-LO and

b-catenin. Therefore, we coexpressed 5-LO in 293T cells together with a HA-tagged constitutive active b-catenin mutant,
S33A, which lacks the phosphorylation sites for proteasomal
degradation (Supplementary Fig. S5, right). Coimmunoprecipitation using anti–5-LO or high afﬁnity anti-HA antibodies
coupled to magnetic beads, followed by Western blotting,
revealed a direct interaction between 5-LO and active b-catenin (Supplementary Fig. S5, left, IP 5-LO and IP HA). The slight
bands of 5-LO in b-catenin in the respective anti–b-catenin or
anti–5-LO precipitates were most likely due to speciﬁc binding
of endogenous proteins. 293T cells expressed both endogenous
b-catenin and 5-LO (data not shown). Nevertheless, upon
overexpression of both proteins the amount of precipitated
5-LO or b-catenin, respectively, was clearly higher than that
seen in the controls showing a direct interaction between the
two proteins.
In summary, our data show a direct interaction between 5LO and b-catenin, the key regulator of the Wnt signaling
pathway, which may account for the inhibitory effect of
inactive 5-LO on Wnt signaling.
5-LO colocalizes with b-catenin and hinders b-catenin
from entering the nucleus
To conﬁrm the biologic relevance of the interaction between
5-LO and b-catenin revealed in vitro, we sought to disclose the
mechanism by which this interaction interferes with Wnt
signaling. Therefore, we studied the inﬂuence of the expression
of 5-LO on the localization of b-catenin in PR9 cells by indirect
immunoﬂuorescence. Thus, we expressed 5-LO in PR9 cells
and induced them to express PML/RARa by Zn2þ treatment.
To investigate the colocalization of 5-LO and b-catenin, we
performed double anti–5-LO/anti–b-catenin staining. As controls, we used empty vector–transfected P/R9 cells.

Roos et al.

The expression of PML/RARa upon Zn2þ induction was
conﬁrmed by anti-RARa staining, which revealed the typical
microspeckled pattern of PML/RARa (Supplementary Fig.
S6; refs. 40, 41). The b-catenin expression in U937 cells
showed a more scattered pattern than in other cell lines,
most often ﬁbroblasts, where the distribution of b-catenin is
more diffuse (42–44). As shown in Fig. 6A, upon Zn2þ
induction, the proportion of nuclear b-catenin (red ﬂuorochrome) increased, conﬁrming activation of Wnt signaling
upon PML/RARa induction. In contrast, in the absence of
PML/RARa, anti–b-catenin staining was seen exclusively in
the cytoplasm. The expression of 5-LO in the PR9 cells led to
perinuclear anti–5-LO staining (green ﬂuorochrome),
whereas empty vector–transfected cells did not reveal any
speciﬁc anti–5-LO staining, further conﬁrming that these
cells do not express 5-LO. The anti–5-LO staining was
not inﬂuenced by the presence of PML/RARa. In contrast,
in the presence of 5-LO, no nuclear anti–b-catenin staining
was seen. The superimposition of anti 5-LO (green ﬂuorochrome) and anti–b-catenin (red ﬂuorochrome) staining
showed partial colocalization of 5-LO and b-catenin (yellow)
(Fig. 6A). Four confocal sections (Fig. 6B, a–d) of the same
cell taken on the horizontal axis of the microscope (0.25–0.33
mm interval) are shown in Fig. 6B. To view the colocalization
in greater detail, a further electronic 4-fold magniﬁcation
of the indicated area of each layer is shown (Fig. 6B, a'–d').
A three-dimensional reconstruction of all the layers of the
cell (data not shown) illustrated the same colocalization
seen in Fig. 6B. The apparently small amount of colocalizing

5-LO and b-catenin accords with the data obtained by
coimmunoprecipitation.
To investigate whether CJ-13,610 is capable of inducing
colocalization of 5-LO and b-catenin, human NB4 acute
promyelocytic leukemia cells exhibiting well-deﬁned cytosolic 5-LO expression were exposed to 3 mmol/L CJ-13,610.
As can be seen treatment with CJ-13,610 led to partial
colocalization of 5-LO and b-catenin (Supplementary Fig.
S7) strengthening the hypothesis of a 5-LO–mediated suppression of Wnt signaling induced by CJ-13,610. Taken
together, immunoﬂuorescence studies could conﬁrm the
direct interaction of 5-LO with b-catenin, triggered by CJ13,610, suggesting also a novel mechanism for Wnt signaling
inhibition by which b-catenin is prevented by 5-LO from
entering the nucleus.

Discussion
The aim of our study was to determine whether the inhibition of 5-LO may account for the effects of NSAIDs on the
Wnt signaling pathway and to assess their capacity to suppress
CSCs in leukemia. We could show that the pharmacologic
inhibition of 5-LO at clinically feasible concentrations of
selective inhibitors, CJ-13,610 or zileuton (45–47) suppresses
the aberrant stem cell capacity of PML/RARa-positive HSPCs
via inhibition of Wnt signaling. In addition, inhibitors of the
other arachidonic acid metabolizing enzymes, COX and sEH,
failed to suppress PML/RARa-positive HSPCs. Finally, a number of subsequent experiments substantiated the CJ-13,610–
independent suppressive action of ectopically expressed 5-LO

5-Lipoxygenase and Leukemic Stem Cells

on Wnt signaling and leukemic cells. Thus, suppression of
aberrant stem cell capacity should mainly result from the
drug's ability to speciﬁcally target 5-LO. However, pleiotropic
off-target effects of CJ-13,610 cannot ultimately be excluded.
Nevertheless, even the existence of such possible off-target
effects, contributing to the antileukemic effect of the drug,
would not detract from the documented key ﬁnding of a pivotal
role of 5-LO in AML.
On the basis of our ﬁndings that the 5-LO directly interacts
with b-catenin, we conclude that the Wnt inhibitory effect of
NSAIDs in our leukemia model is mediated not by inhibition of
the COX-1/2 and prostaglandin E2 synthesis as observed in
models of colorectal cancer (48). This is supported by the
ﬁnding that the activation of Wnt signaling in LSC is not
related to upregulation of COX, but is related to the presence of
aberrant chimeric transcription factors resulting from chromosomal translocations such as t(15;17)-PML/RARa or t(8;21)
AML-1/ETO fusion proteins (10, 12). The inhibitory effect on
tumor stem cells of the inhibition of 5-LO is not limited to our
leukemia model but has also been described in glioblastoma.
Here, the selective 5-LO inhibitor, Nordy, was able to reduce
sphere formation and the frequency of stem cells in xenograft
tumors (49).
Both the genetic disruption and pharmacologic inhibition
of 5-LO suppress the tumor-initiating cells of BCR/ABLdriven CML-like disease in mice (18). This is, at least
partially, in contrast with our ﬁndings on the PML/RARadriven AML model, in which the genetic targeting of 5-LO
did not replicate the effects of pharmacologic inhibition on
the stem cell capacity. This is in accordance with recent
ﬁndings showing full leukemogenic potential of AML-1/
ETOex9–expressing HSPCs in an Alox5/ background
although an impairment of the in vitro self-renewal of HSPCs
expressing either AML-1/ETOex9, PML/RARa or MLL/AF9
was seen (50). CML is a myeloproliferative disease characterized by proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors, which
are still able to fully differentiate. PML/RARa induces an
acute leukemia characterized by aberrant self-renewal of the
HSCs and differentiation block. The stem cell compartment
of these two diseases differ being more mature for the CMLlike disease and very primitive HSPCs for PML/RARa
(31, 51). Furthermore, the induction and the maintenance
of AML-LSC depend on the activation of Wnt signaling,
whereas for the induction of CML-like disease, Wnt signaling
seems to be nonessential (5). Therefore, we hypothesize that
the presence of the enzymatically inactive form of 5-LO is
needed to inhibit Wnt signaling in the PML/RARa-positive
HSPCs by blocking the transition of b-catenin to the nucleus.
That 5-LO is able to alter nuclear trafﬁcking of a protein, was
shown for p53, as 5-LO antagonized genotoxic stressinduced apoptosis by inhibiting binding of p53 to the
promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and its relocalization
into PML-nuclear bodies (52).
The exact molecular mechanism by which inhibitorbound and catalytically inactive 5-LO interacts with b-catenin and possibly other Wnt components remains unclear.
Possibly, 5-LO inhibitors, such as CJ-13,610 and zileuton,
induce certain conformational changes in the 5-LO enzyme,

www.aacrjournals.org

thereby allowing suppressive interactions of the enzyme
with other proteins of the Wnt signaling pathway. Similarly,
AA and competitive 5-LO inhibitors mimicking AA were
observed to trigger changes in subcellular localization of
5-LO that may relate to the effects observed in this study
with CJ-13,610 (53). As a consequence, cytosolic and perinuclear b-catenin bound to 5-LO may be trapped and
hindered from entering the nucleus, suggesting that the
protein cannot drive anymore the proleukemic transcription
of Wnt target genes, as demonstrated in our study. Notably,
in PR9 cells, ectopically transfected 5-LO is capable of
suppressing Wnt signaling, whereas in other cell types,
including the PML/RARa-positive HSPCs, the presence of
CJ-13,610 is required to convert 5-LO to an active Wnt
suppressor. We conclude that the environment of PR9 cells
into which the ectopically transfected 5-LO is imbedded
renders 5-LO catalytically inactive by still unknown mechanisms thereby allowing inhibition of Wnt signaling. Further
biophysical studies on protein structure are required addressing in detail the possible conformational changes in 5-LO
after binding to 5-LO inhibitors allowing interaction with
b-catenin.
Our study demonstrated a crucial role for 5-LO in the
maintenance of LSCs in AML, conﬁrming recent data in
murine models of AML (50). The fact that, in a subset of
tumors, the inhibition of 5-LO is able to suppress the tumor
stem cell renders feasible a stem cell therapy as a maintenance
regimen after induction and consolidation therapy protocols.
The use of 5-LO inhibitors, instead of COX inhibitors, would
further avoid the adverse effects of COX inhibitors, such as
gastrointestinal bleeding and ulcerations or cardiovascular
side effects, including hypertension, myocardial infarction,
and stroke. Taken together, our data establish pharmacologic
inhibition of 5-LO as a novel approach of stem cell therapy in
leukemia, by targeting Wnt signaling.
