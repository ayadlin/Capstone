ABSTRACT
HER2, a well established oncogenic member of EGFR family, is among the most
intensely investigated kinase drug targets. In contrast to hotspot mutations of EGFR,
few mutations of HER2 locate in activation loop within kinase domain. We previously
reported the molecular mechanism underlying hyper kinase activity of HER2H878Y, a
mutation located in activation loop. However, its tumorigenicity in vivo and relevant
therapeutics remain to be determined. Here, we report for the first time that HER2H878Y
was tumorigenic in vivo in lung adenocarcinoma transgenic mouse model. Induced
expression of HER2H878Y in lung epithelial compartments resulted in formation of
poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC)
features. Strikingly, we found that these tumors depended on continuous expression
of HER2H878Y for maintenance. Typical HER2 downstream signaling mediators, including
PLCγ1, STAT5 and AKT, were hyperactivated in HER2H878Y driven lung tumors. More
importantly, administration of HKI-272, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), efficiently
shrank HER2H878Y driven tumors in transgenic mouse model. Moreover, we found that
combinational treatment with HKI272 and mTOR inhibitor, Rapamycin, showed a
superior cytotoxicity to H878Y mutant transformed cells and enhanced activity to elicit
apoptosis and inhibit growth in situ in tumorous area. Our work therefore showed
that HER2H878Y mutant was a reasonable drug target. Hence, our work supported the
assessment of HKI-272/rapamycin treatment in clinical trials.

INTRODUCTION

differentiation at both cellular and organismal level [1, 2].
Numerous studies reported that HER2 was amplified
and overexpressed in several types of cancer, especially
in breast cancer [2-4]. Consistently, overexpression of
HER2 could continuously activate cellular proliferation
and survival pathways, resulting in cell transformation
and evasion from cell death [5]. Interestingly, HER2 was
recently reported to be overexpressed in lung cancers with
acquired resistance to EGFR targeted therapy that lack the

HER2, a 185-Kd transmembrane receptor tyrosine
kinase of the ErbB family, is a heterodimer partner to other
ErbB family members to prolong and enhance downstream
signaling with ampliative ligand specificity [1], resulting
in activation of several downstream signaling pathways,
including MAPK, PKC and AKT pathways. HER2 thus
plays important roles in cell division, migration and

In addition to overexpressed status, mutations
were also found to activate HER2 signaling loop and
drive tumorigenesis. Bose et al. found seven HER2
somatic mutations in breast cancer lacking HER2 gene
amplification [7]. These mutations strongly increased
phosphorylation of HER2 downstream signaling proteins,
including PLCγ and MAPK, indicating that these are
activating mutations; all of these mutations are sensitive
to HER2 inhibitor HKI-272 (neratinib), including the
lapatinib resistant mutation HER2 L755S [7]. Moreover,
HER2 mutation (mainly G776insYVMA mutation) was
found in 2~4% lung cancer patients [8-10]. Most of these
reported mutations were located in HER2 extracellular
domain and kinase domain, but not in the activation
loop [7], which is in contrast to several prominent
oncogenic mutations, such as BRAF V600E and ALK
R1275Q,moreover,the hotspot mutation, L858R [11] in
EGFR locates in its activation loop.
Recently, H878Y mutation in HER2 was reported
in 11% of hepatocellular carcinoma patients [12]. The
mutation results in the mutant HER2 to harbor Y877/
Y878 motif in activation loop, similar to wild-type Y1007/
Y1008 in the JAK2 kinase [13]. Our previous work have
shown phospho-Y878 forms a salt bridge with the adjacent
R898 residue to stabilize the kinase in a permissive
conformation, thus conferring an enhanced kinase activity
for HER2 [14].
Despite of the previous biochemical characterization,
whether H878Y mutant HER2 is tumorigenic in mouse
level and relevant therapeutics remain to be determined.
HER2 transgenic mouse models reported in earlier studies
mainly focused on wild-type HER2 in breast cancer [2]
and the recent HER2 G776insYVMA mutation in lung
cancer model [10]. Here we reported a doxycycline
inducible H878Y transgenic mouse model. We showed
that overexpression of H878Y mutant HER2 resulted in
formation of poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma
with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) features and
that tumors were dependent on continuous expression of
mutant HER2 for maintenance. We further showed that
tumors driven by HER2 H878Y mutant were sensitive to
HKI-272. We also showed that combinational treatment
with HKI-272 and Rapamycin resulted in enhanced
toxicity to HER2 H878Y in vitro transformed cell lines
and in vivo tumors.

HER2 transforms normal mammary epithelial cell and
induce breast cancer in mouse model [2]. Earlier reports
by us and others showed that HER2H878Y(H878Y hereafter)
is transforming in vitro [14, 15]. We established stable cell
lines to overexpress wild-type and H878Y mutant HER2
in two normal cell lines (NIH-3T3 and BEAS-2B) and
checked their ability to form colonies in soft agar system.
Consistent with our earlier report, we found that H878Y
was more potent than wild-type HER2 to transform
both of the cells (Supplementary Figure. 1A and 1B). In
addition, these stable H878Y over-expressed cell lines
showed markedly enhanced downstream signals, including
phosphorylated PLCγ and STAT5 (Supplementary Figure.
1C). These data again confirms H878Y is a gain-offunction mutation.
While wildtype HER2 overexpressed tumor cells
were sensitive to HER2 inhibitors, those transformed cells
by mutants like V777L, G776insYVMA and truncated
isoform were less sensitive or resistant to HER2 inhibitor
lapatinib [9, 16, 17]. In order to determine the sensitivity
of H878Y to HER2 kinase inhibitors, we treated HER2
expressed cell lines with HKI-272 (Neratinib), an
irreversible dual inhibitor of HER2 and EGFR currently
tested in clinical trial. Consistent with our earlier report,
short-term treatment (30 min) efficiently inhibited HER2
elicited signals (Figure 1A), suggesting that both wild-type
and H878Y HER2 were sensitive to HKI-272 inhibition.
Consequently, we observed reduced phosphorylation of
AKT and ERK1/2, two canonical proliferation signals
downstream of HER2. Meanwhile, a long-term (3 days)
HKI-272 treatment dramatically inhibited proliferation of
transformed cells (Figure 1B and 1C). Our data therefore
demonstrated that H878Y mutation conferred higher
oncogenic activity and elicited stronger downstream
signals in comparison with wild-type HER2. More
importantly, H878Y mutation was also sensitive to HKI272 in vitro cells.

adenocarcinoma in transgenic mouse model
Given that HER2 H878Y is a gain-of-function
mutation and H878Y mutation is also found in a portion
of cancer patients, it would be interested to test whether
H878Y is tumorigenic in vivo. Previous research had
reported that HER2YVMA mutant could drive rapid
development of lung adenosquamous with intrabronchial
carcinomas in the proximal and distal brochioloalveolar
locations [10]. The notable difference of mutation spot
within HER2 kinase between HER2YVMA and H878Y
(HER2YVMA in kinase domain versus H878Y in activation
loop) motivated us to test tumorigenecity of H878Y
mutant HER2 in vivo with transgenic mice.
We therefore utilized the inducible ‘tet-on’
expression system to generate tet-op hHER2H878Y transgenic

study [21, 22]. Among 10 available transgenic mouse
founder lines, CC10-rtTA/tet-op hHER2H878Y pups of three
founder lines efficiently developed lung tumors when fed
on doxycycline (Dox hereafter)-containing diet for about
10 days. All of those mouse eventually died after Dox
induction for around 2.5 months. After Dox treatment
for one month, we sacrificed the mouse to examine the
pathology of the lungs. We detected poorly differentiated
lung adenocarcinomas with features of diffused
bronchioloalveolar carcinoma in H878Y transgenic mouse
(Supplementary Figure 2C), which was in strikingly
contrast to those seen in HER2YVMA transgenic mice
(glandular and squamous differentiation pathology with
in situ tumor mainly located in proximal and distal airway
epithelia [10]). These results were also confirmed with
thorough analysis of the pathology of lungs from mouse
fed on Dox for around 2 months (Figure. 2A), suggesting

mice, in a similar way with the reported HER2YVMA
transgenic mice. To achieve this goal, an open reading
frame (ORF) encoding human H878Y HER2 was cloned
in between a TetO promoter/β-globin intron and a SV40
polyA cassette (Supplementary Figure. 2A). The linear
DNA fragment was microinjected into FVB/N fertilized
eggs to obtain transgenic mouse founders (Supplementary
Figure 2B). The resulting tet-op hHER2H878Y founders
were then crossed with CC10-rtTA mouse to generate
bitransgenic mouse for specific overexpression of H878Y
transgene within lung epithelium in a doxycyclineinducible manner [18]. We had successfully applied
this system in several of our studies and found that this
system was capable of tight control of the expression
of the transgene [19, 20]. Moreover, targeted therapy
developed based on this system was widely applicable to
various types of tumors, but not limited to lung cancer

H878Y driven lung tumors are dependent

different mechanisms underline tumorigenesis driven by
H878Y and YVMA mutant HER2 in vivo. In addition,
bitransgenic pups of all three H878Y founder lines had
a medium survival below 10 weeks after Dox induction
(Figure. 2B). Additionally, Immunoblotting of lung tissue
lysates from tumor bearing transgenic mouse had been
detected with activated HER2 downstream signals (Figure
2C), consistent with the result from in vitro cell lines.

Addiction to driver oncogene was reported in
various types of cancers. Thus, we assessed whether
H878Y induced tumors were dependent on continuous
H878Y expression for tumor maintenance. We generated
a cohort of bitransgenic mouse and fed them with Dox
to induce lung cancer for one month. The tumor burden
was documented through CT imaging (Left panel, Figure

3A). Strinkingly, we observed that these lung tumor
completely regressed in response to withdrawal of Dox
for 2 weeks (middle panel, Figure 3A), indicating that
H878Y continuous expression was essential for tumor

maintenance. Histology analysis revealed largely normal
lung, with occasional areas of thickened alveolar wall and
fibrosis (right panel, Figure 3A), indicating remodeling of
lung tissues.

Next, we wondered whether discontinuing HER2
expression led to a reduction of HER2 signal. To
validate our hypothesis, we analyzed HER2 expression
and function in these mouse at different time points.
We collected lung tissues from mouse fed on Dox for
35 days, on Dox 35 days/off Dox for 3, 7, or 14 days
serial treatment as well as normal diet treatment, and
analyzed HER2 and phospho-HER2 expression through
Western blotting. We found that HER2 signal arose from
undetectable in the mouse fed on normal diet to strong
expression level in mouse on continuous Dox for 35
days, and rapidly waned after Dox withdrawal (Figure
3B). To validate these phenomena in situ in tumor
tissues, we analyzed HER2 and phospho-HER2 levels
in lungs through immunohistochemistry (IHC). Lung
tissues from bitransgenic mouse without Dox induction

were negative of HER2 and phospho-HER2 signals. In
contrast, we detected strong HER2 and phospho-HER2
activated signals in mouse fed on Dox for 25 days. After
35 days Dox induction, strong HER2 and phosphoHER2 signals were detected in poorly differentiated lung
adenocarcinoma in the bitransgenic mouse. Strikingly,
withdrawal of Dox for just 3 days led to regression
of HER2 signals to the baseline level, and remained
undetectable by 7 and 14 days after Dox withdrawal
(Figure 3C).
To determine the biological mechanism underlying
tumor regression, we assessed the cellular proliferative/
apoptotic index in the tumor regions of mouse after
withdrawing Dox. As short as for 3 days of Dox
withdrawl, Ki-67, a classical cell proliferation marker,
was dramatically downregulated in tumors (Figure 3D,

top panel; quantification in Figure 3E). Conversely, the
number of apoptotic cells within tumor were increased
by TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP
nick-end labeling) assay (Figure 3D, bottom panel;
quantification in Figure 3F).
Taken together, these data showed that H878Ydriven tumors required the continuous function of HER2
mutant for tumor maintenance, suggesting that targeted
HER2 H878Y signaling maybe a valid option.

We therefore tested whether combinational therapy could
enhance the cytotoxicity to tumors.
Of note, although we observed a reduction of AKT
phosphoryation in HER2 transformed cells in both NIH3T3 and BEAS-2B cellular background after treatment
with HKI-272, residual phosphorylation of AKT signal
was still to be detected (Figure 1A). AKT was an
important effector for cell survival. Complete inhibition of
AKT signaling in tumor cells would be ideal. Interestingly,
the inhibition of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway
with a PI3K and mTOR dual inhibitor (NVP-BEZ235)
was shown to be effective in reducing viable HER2-driven
cancer cells [27]. This suggests that Rapamycin might
represent a suitable candidate for an adjuvant therapeutic
modality that can be applied in combination with HKI-272
for treating H878Y mutant-driven cancers.
We found that Rapamycin alone elicited a moderate
growth inhibition in H878Y mutant transformed Ba/
F3 cells, but not in WT HER2 transformed cells
(Supplementary Figure 3), further suggesting that the
increased AKT signaling elicited by the H878Y mutant
rendered cells more sensitive to mTOR pathway inhibition.
To further evaluate the potency of combinational treatment
with HKI-272 and Rapamycin, we assessed the IC50 values
of combined therapy with HKI-272 and Rapamycin
compared to HKI-272 monotherapy. The IC50 of HKI-272
alone was approximately 2.4 nM and shifted a decrease to
approximately 0.3 nM in the presence of 2 nM Rapamycin
(Figure 5A). This finding showed that rapamycin
synergized with HKI-272 to effectively kill H878Y HER2
mutant-transformed Ba/F3 cells. Consistently, we found
that combinational treatment with Rapamycin and HKI272 led to a decrease in signals of S6 phosphorylation and
Cyclin D1 as well as inhibition of HER2, AKT and ERK
phosphorylation in H878Y HER2 transformed 3T3 cells
(Figure 5B). Our data showed that combined treatment
with HKI-272 and rapamycin resulted in superior
inhibition of signaling elicited by H878Y HER2 compared
to either agent alone.
We further tested the combinational therapy in vivo.
We treated a cohort of tumor-bearing bitransgenic mouse
with vehicle, Rapamycin, HKI-272 and Rapamycin/HKI272 combination. Rapamycin treatment for 3 days was
effective in inhibiting tumor cell growth, as indicated
by Ki-67 staining, but showned no evident effect in
eliciting tumor cell death, as indicated by TUNEL staining
(Figure 5C-5E). However, HKI-272 alone was effective
both in tumor cell growth inhibition and apoptosis
induction. Strikingly, we found that HKI-272/Rapamycin
combinational therapy elicited significantly increased
tumor cell death and inhibited cellular proliferation
compared to either drug alone (Figure 5C-5E). These
results showed that the combinational treatment was more
toxic to tumor cells transformed by HER2 H878Y in vivo.

hHER2H878Y-driven tumors are sensitive to HKI272 treatment in vivo
We have shown that HKI-272 exhibited superior
inhibition of HER2 elicited signaling in vitro cells [14].
Studies from our transgenic mouse model showed that
H878Y mutant HER2 function was important for the
maintenance of tumor. To mimic clinical settings, we
tested whether HKI-272 was effective in shrinking lung
adenocarcinoma in transgenic mouse model. We fed a
cohort of CC10-rtTA/tet-op hHER2H878Y mouse with Dox
diet for one month and documented the tumor burden
through CT imaging. Strikingly, we found that HKI-272
treatment for 2 weeks led to almost complete regression
of the tumors, while tumors in placebo-treated group grew
rapidly (Figure 4A,top two panels for CT images; Figure
4B for quantification). Histology data were consistent with
imaging (Figure 4A, lower panel).
To see the effect of HKI-272 on HER2 downstream
signals, we conducted immunoblotting analysis on
the lung tissues. As expected, we found that HER2
downstream mediators, including PLCγ, STAT5, AKT and
Cyclin D1, were decreased in tumor tissues lysates (Figure
4C). We further checked whether HKI-272 treatment led
to apoptosis of tumor cells. As readouts for therapeutic
efficacy, we evaluated proliferative (Ki-67) and apoptotic
(TUNEL) marker in situ in the tumor cells by IHC. HKI272 treatment for 3 days was effective in inhibiting tumor
cell growth, as indicated by Ki-67 staining, and HKI-272
also eliciting tumor cell apoptosis, as indicated by TUNEL
staining (Figure 4D for images; Figure 4E and 4F for
quantification).

Combinational treatment with HKI-272 and
Rapamycin shows enhanced cytotoxicity to tumor
driven by hHER2H878Y
Although HKI-272 is effective in shrinking H78Y
mutant HER2 driven tumors, tumors in patients may
be more complicated and combinational therapy may
be necessary in those cases. The inhibitors preferably
target on the same protein [23, 24], or distinct signaling
components in the same pathway [25]. This was
particularly relevant due to the release of feedback
inhibition during targeting ErbB family members [26].

DISCUSSION

mutant EGFR in lung cancers was not dependent on
dimerization for functioning, and therefore, antibodies
may be less effective on these mutations [29]. In the case
of TKI resistance, combinational treatment with antibody
and TKI is expected to kill HER2 transformed cells more
effectively [30].
Of note, mTOR inhibition could upregulate the
autophage. We noted in our mouse model that rapamycin
synergized with HKI-272 to induce autophagy in H878Y
driven lung tumors (data not shown).
Tumors in patients developed through long terms
of inactivation of tumor suppressor genes and activation
of growth promoting oncogenes, such that treatments that
effectively killed tumor cell cell lines or shrank tumors in
mouse models sometimes fail in patients. Combinational
treatments based on reasonably designed schemes are
preferable. We found that H878Y drove stronger activation
of AKT signaling and residual AKT activation remained to
be detected after HKI-272 treatment. We therefore tested
Rapamycin, an inhibitor to block the mTOR signaling
downstream of AKT to combine HKI-272 as a therapeutic
strategy. We had confirmed the superior treatment effect
in cell lines and in transgenic mouse models with this
combined therapy, which caused tumor cell growth
inhibition and apoptosis induction for HER2 H878Y
mutant.
Our current work therefore revealed that H878Y
mutant was tumorigenic in vivo and was a reasonable
target for tumors driven by this HER2 mutation.
Combinational treatment with HKI-272 and Rapamycin
is effective in vivo mouse models, and warrant further
validation in clinic.

Due to its high rate of deregulation (either
overexpression or mutation) in various tumor types, HER2
is among the most intensely investigated drug targets.
Mutations of HER2 within kinase domain are roughly
grouped into two categories: activation loop and nonactivation-loop mutations. H878Y is the only mutation
located within activation loop reported for HER2. Our
previous and present work have shown that H878Y HER2
is a gain-of-function mutation, which is tumorigenic
in vivo in transgenic mouse model. More importantly,
the tumor driven by this oncogene is dependent on its
continuous expression for maintenance and these tumors
can be effectively treated by a HER2 kinase inhibitor in
this mouse model.
Activation loop of EGFR is frequently detected to
be mutated in a variety of tumors. For example, L858R
is one of the most potent mutations found in lung cancer
patients [11]. These mutations are reported to enhance
kinase activity of EGFR. Many researches have reported
that these mutations are tumorigenic in vivo and that these
mutations sensitize the tumor to EGFR TKI treatment. In
contrast, H878Y is the only mutation reported in activation
loop of HER2. We recently reported that H878Y was a
gain-of-function mutation in vitro cell lines, and revealed
a potential mechanism underlying this gain-of-function.
Interestingly, we found H878Y mutation similar to L858R
in EGFR in the way that it was a TKI-sensitizing mutation,
which was different from 776 insertional mutation
HER2YVMA. In our present work, we found that HKI-272,
now entering clinic trial, was effective in treating H878Y
mutant HER2 driven tumors. However, we had found that
HKI-272 alone was not as effective as in H878Y case for
treating tumors driven by HER2YVMA(data not shown).
Oncogenic HER2 was reported to activate some
downstream effectors, such as PLCγ [28]. Considering
the difference in locations within HER2 protein, the
difference in the phenotypes of formed tumors, and the
difference in drug sensitivity revealed in our work, HER2
H878Y and HER2YVMA mutations may impact HER2
function in drastically different ways. Our data therefore
highlighted the necessity and importance to further study
the difference in signaling between H878Y and most
other non-activatioin-loop-localizing mutations (such as
HER2YVMA).
A number of HER2 inhibitory reagents are now
available: small molecules and antibodies. Our earlier
work reported that second generation inhitors such as
BIBW-2992 and HKI-272 outperformed reversible
inhibitors against HER2 transformed Ba/F3 cells in two
ways: HKI-272 was less toxic to nontransformed cells, and
HKI-272 was more potent in killing HER2 transformed
cells. Antibodies can inhibit homo-dimerization of HER2
or hetero-dimerization with other members of ErbB
family. Our work had reported that exon19 deletion

Plasmids constructs, stable cell lines generation,
soft agar assay and cell viability assay were described as
previous study [14].

H&E and IHC staining
Lungs were collected from animals and fixed
overnight in 10% formalin supplied with 1mM NaF,
1mM NaVO3, 1mM PMSF. Hematoxylin and eosin
( H&E) staining and Immuno- histological (IHC)
staining were performed on 5μm formalin-fixed
paraffin sections. The antibodies used were described in
Western Blotting section. The ABC-Elite Rabbit IgG kit
(Vector Laboratories) was used as secondary detection
system (45min incubation at room temperature). DAB
(Sigma) was used as a substrate. Ki-67 antibody (Vector
Laboratories) was used to assess the proliferation of cells.
Apoptosis was measured by TUNEL assay with TMR red
In Situ Cell Death detection Kit (Roche) according to the
manual. The nucleus was stained with DAPI.

Western blotting
All cells or tissues were lysed in RIPA buffer
(Beyotime) supplemented with protease and phosphatase
inhibitors (Roche). Following lysis, the cells were
sonicated. Western blotting was performed using standard
methods. Antibody against β-actin was from Sigma,
other antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology.

Generation
of
the
CC10-rtTA/tet-ophHER2H878Y mouse cohort

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

To generate Tet-op-hHER2H878Y transgenic mice,
human HER2 H878Y DNA was subcloned into pTRETight (Clonetech), and then a β- globin intron was
subcloned into this plasmid and just located between
the Tet-responsive Ptight promoter and H878Y ORF. The
DNA fragments containing Tet-op-β-globin intronhHER2 H878Y-SV40 polyA were injected into FVB/N
blastocysts. The progeny were genotyped as described
[26]. All mouse were housed in SPF room at NIBS’ animal
room and crossed with CC10-rtTA [26]. Genotyping of
CC10-rtTA and tet-op-hHER2H878Y were performed by
using following primers: for CC10-rtTA, forward primer:
AAAATCTTGCCAGCTTTCCCC ; reverse primer:
ACTGCCCATTGCCCAAACAC. For tet-op-hHER2H878Y,
forward primer: GGCACCCAGCTCTTTGAGGA ;
reverse primer: CACCTCTCGCAAGTGCTCCA .

All mice were housed in a pathogen-free
environment at the National Institute of Biological
Sciences, Beijing (NIBS). All mouse were handled strictly
in accordance with good animal practice as defined by the
Animal Facility in NIBS, and all animal work were done
with approval from Institutional Committee for Animal
Care and Use in NIBS. CC10-rtTA/Tet-op-hHER2H878Y
mouse fed on Dox food when the pups reached 30 days
old. After continuous exposure to doxycycline-containing
diets (Research Diets) for 5 weeks, mouse were then
randomized to groups and treated daily with 50 mg/kg
HKI-272 (Selleck Chemicals) or 2mg/kg Rapamycin
(Selleck Chemicals). HKI-272 was formulated in 0.5%
