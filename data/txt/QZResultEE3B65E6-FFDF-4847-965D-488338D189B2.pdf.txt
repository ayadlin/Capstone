Comprehensive Molecular Characterization of Human Colon and
Rectal Cancer
The Cancer Genome Atlas Network

Summary
Author Manuscript

To characterize somatic alterations in colorectal carcinoma (CRC), we conducted genome-scale
analysis of 276 samples, analyzing exome sequence, DNA copy number, promoter methylation,
mRNA and microRNA expression. A subset (97) underwent low-depth-of-coverage wholegenome sequencing. 16% of CRC have hypermutation, three quarters of which have the expected
high microsatellite instability (MSI), usually with hypermethylation and MLH1 silencing, but one
quarter has somatic mismatch repair gene mutations. Excluding hypermutated cancers, colon and
rectum cancers have remarkably similar patterns of genomic alteration. Twenty-four genes are
significantly mutated. In addition to the expected APC, TP53, SMAD4, PIK3CA and KRAS
mutations, we found frequent mutations in ARID1A, SOX9, and FAM123B/WTX. Recurrent copy
number alterations include potentially drug-targetable amplifications of ERBB2 and newly
discovered amplification of IGF2. Recurrent chromosomal translocations include fusion of NAV2
and WNT pathway member TCF7L1. Integrative analyses suggest new markers for aggressive
CRC and important role for MYC-directed transcriptional activation and repression.

Background
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project plans to profile genomic changes in 20 different
cancer types and has published results on two cancer types1,2. We now present results from
multidimensional analyses of human colorectal cancer (CRC).

CRC is an important contributor to cancer mortality and morbidity. The distinction between
colon and rectum is largely anatomical, but it impacts both surgical and radiotherapeutic
management and it may impact prognosis. Most investigators divide CRC biologically into
those with microsatellite instability (MSI) (located primarily in the right colon and
frequently associated with the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) and hypermutation) and those that are microsatellite-stable (MSS) but chromosomally unstable (CIN).
A rich history of investigations (for a review see3) has revealed several critical genes and
pathways important to the initiation and progression of CRC3. These include the WNT,
RAS-MAPK, PI3K, TGF-β, P53 and DNA mismatch repair pathways. Large-scale
sequencing analyses4–6 have identified numerous recurrently mutated genes and a recurrent

chromosomal translocation. Despite that background, we have not had a fully integrated
view of the genetic and genomic changes and their significance for colorectal tumorigenesis.
Further insight into those changes may enable deeper understanding of the pathophysiology
of CRC and may identify potential therapeutic targets.

Results
Tumor/normal pairs were analyzed by different platforms. The specific numbers of samples
analyzed by each platform are shown in Supplementary Table 1.
Exome sequence analysis

Author Manuscript

To define the mutational spectrum, we performed exome capture DNA sequencing on 224
tumor/normal pairs (Supplementary Table 2 lists all mutations). Sequencing achieved >20X
coverage of at least 80% of targeted exons. The somatic mutation rates varied considerably
among the samples. Some had mutation rates <1/106 bases, whereas a few had mutations
rates >100/106. We separated those cases (84%) with a mutation rate <8.24/106 (median
number of non-synonymous mutations: 58) and those with mutations rates >12/106 (median
number of mutations: 728), which we designated as hypermutated (Figure 1).

Author Manuscript

To assess the basis for the strikingly different mutation rates, we evaluated microsatellite
instability (MSI)7 and mutations in the DNA mismatch repair pathway8–10 genes MLH1,
MLH3, MSH2, MSH3, MSH6 and PMS2. Among the 30 hypermutated tumors with a
complete data set, 23 (77%) had high levels of MSI (MSI-H). Included were 19 with MLH1
methylation, 17 of which had high CpG island methylation phenotype (CIMP). By
comparison, the remaining seven hypermutated tumors, including the six with the highest
mutation rates, lacked MSI-H, CIMP or MLH1 methylation but usually had somatic
mutations in one or more mismatch repair genes or Polε aberrations rarely seen in the nonhypermutated tumors (Figure 1).
Gene mutations

Author Manuscript

Overall, we identified 32 somatic recurrently mutated genes (defined by MutSig11 and
manual curation) in the hypermutated and non-hypermutated cancers (Figure 1B). After
removal of non-expressed genes, there were 15 and 17, respectively, in the hypermutated
and non-hypermutated cancers (Figure 1B, see Supplementary Table 3 for complete list).
Among the non-hypermutated tumors, the eight most frequently mutated genes were APC,
TP53, KRAS, PIK3CA, FBXW7, SMAD4, TCF7L2 and NRAS. As expected, the mutated
KRAS and NRAS genes usually had oncogenic codon 12/13 or 61 mutations, whereas the
remaining genes had inactivating mutations. CTNNB1, SMAD2, FAM123B and SOX9 were
also mutated frequently. FAM123B (WTX) is an X-linked negative regulator of WNT
signaling12, and virtually all its mutations were loss-of-function. Mutations in SOX9, a gene
important in cell differentiation in the intestinal stem cell niche13,14, have not been
associated previously with human cancer, but all nine mutated alleles in the nonhypermutated CRCs were frameshift or nonsense mutations. Tumor suppressors ATM and
ARID1A also had a disproportionately high number of frameshift or nonsense mutations.
ARID1A mutations have recently been reported in CRC and many other cancers15,16.

In the hypermutated tumors, ACVR2A, APC, TGFBR2, MSH3, MSH6, SLC9A9 and
TCF7L2 were frequent targets of mutation (Figure 1B), along with mostly BRAF V600E
mutations. However, two genes that were frequently mutated in the non-hypermutated
cancers were significantly less frequently mutated in hypermutated tumors: TP53 (60 vs
20%, p < 0.0001), and APC (81% vs 51%, p = 0.0023, both Fisher’s exact test). Other genes,
including TGFBR2, were recurrently mutated in the hypermutated cancers, but not in the
non-hypermutated samples. These findings suggest that hypermutated and nonhypermutated tumors progress through different sequences of genetic events.

Author Manuscript

As expected, hypermutated tumors with MLH1 silencing and MSI-H exhibited additional
differences in mutational profile. When we specifically examined 28 genes with long
mononucleotide repeats in their coding sequences, we found that the rate of frameshift
mutation was 3.6-fold higher than the rate of such mutation in hypermutated tumors without
MLH1 silencing, and 50-fold higher than in non-hypermethylated tumors (Supplementary
Table 2).
Classification of tumors based on mutation rate and methylation pattern
As mentioned above, patients with colon and rectal tumors are managed differently17, and
epidemiology also shows differences between the two17. An initial integrative analysis of
MSI status, somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs), CIMP status and gene expression
profiles of 132 colonic and 62 rectal tumors enabled us to examine possible biological
differences between tumors in the two locations. Among the non-hypermutated tumors,
however, the overall patterns of changes in copy number, CIMP, mRNA and miRNA were
indistinguishable between colon and rectal carcinomas (Figure 2). Based on that result, we
merged the two for all subsequent analyses.

Author Manuscript

Unsupervised clustering of the promoter DNA methylation profiles of 236 colorectal tumors
revealed four subgroups (Supplementary Methods; Supplementary Figure 1). Two of the
clusters contained tumors with elevated rates of methylation and were classified as CIMPhigh (CIMP-H) and CIMP-low (CIMP-L), as previously described18. The two non-CIMP
clusters were predominantly from tumors that were non-hypermutated and derived from
different anatomic locations. mRNA expression profiles separated the colorectal tumors into
three distinct clusters (Supplementary Figure 2). One significantly overlapped with CIMP-H
tumors (p=3×10−12) and was enriched with hypermutated tumors; the other two clusters did
not correspond with any group in the methylation data. Analysis of miRNA expression by
unsupervised clustering (Supplementary Figure 3) identified no clear distinctions between
rectal cancers and non-hypermethylated colon cancers.

Chromosomal and sub-chromosomal changes
257 tumors were profiled for somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) with Affymetrix
SNP 6.0 arrays. Of those tumors, 97 were also analyzed by low depth-of-coverage (lowpass) whole-genome sequencing (WGS). As expected, the hypermutated tumors had far
fewer SCNAs (Figure 2). No difference was found between MSI and MSS hypermutated
tumors (Supplementary Figure 4). We used the GISTIC algorithm19 to identify likely gene
targets of focal alterations. There were several previously well-defined arm-level changes,

including gains of 1q, 7p/q, 8p/q, 12q, 13q, 19q, and 20p/q6 (Supplementary Figure 4;
Supplementary Table 4). Significantly deleted chromosome arms were 18p/q (including
SMAD4) in 66% of the tumors and 17p/q (including TP53) in 56%. Also significantly
deleted genes were 1p, 4q, 5q, 8p, 14q, 15q, 20p, and 22q.
We identified 28 recurrent deletion peaks (Supplementary Table 4; Supplementary Figure
4), including genes like FHIT, A2BP1 and WWOX with large genomic footprints located in
potentially fragile sites of the genome, in near-diploid hypermutated tumors. Other focal
deletions involved tumor suppressor genes such as SMAD4, APC, PTEN and SMAD3. A
significant focal deletion of 10p25.2 spanned four genes, including TCF7L2, which was also
frequently mutated in our dataset. A gene fusion between adjacent genes VTI1A and
TCF7L2 through an interstitial deletion was found in 3% of CRCs and is required for
survival of CRC cells bearing the translocation4.

Author Manuscript

There were 17 regions of significant focal amplification (Supplementary Table 4). Some of
them were superimposed on broad gains of chromosome arms. Included were a peak at
13q12.13 near the peptidase gene USP12 and ~500kB distal to the CRC candidate oncogene
CDK8; an adjacent peak at 13q12; a peak containing KLF5 at 13q22.1; and a peak at
20q13.12 adjacent to HNF4A. Peaks on chromosome 8 included 8p12 (which contains the
histone methyl-transferase WHSC1L1, adjacent to FGFR1) and 8q24 (which contains MYC).
An amplicon at 17q21.1, found in 4% of the tumors, contains seven genes, including the
tyrosine kinase ERBB2. ERBB2 amplifications have been described in colon, breast and
gastric/esophageal tumors, and breast and gastric cancers bearing these amplifications have
been treated effectively with the anti-ERBB2 antibody trastuzumab20–22.

Author Manuscript

One of the most common focal amplifications, found in 7% of the tumors, is gain of a 100–
150 kb region of chromosome arm 11p15.5. It contains the genes encoding insulin (INS),
insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), as well as miR-483,
which is embedded within IGF2 (Figure 3a). We found elevated expression of IGF2 and
miR-483 but not of INS and TH (Figure 3b–c). Immediately adjacent to the amplified region
is ASCL2, a transcription factor active in specifying intestinal stem cell fate23. Although
ASCL2 has been implicated as a target of amplification in CRC23–25, it was consistently
outside the region of amplification and its expression was not correlated with copy-number
changes. These observations suggest that IGF2 and miR-483 are candidate functional targets
of 11p15.5 amplification. IGF2 overexpression through loss of imprinting has been
implicated in the promotion of CRC26,27. MiR-483 may also play a role in CRC
pathogenesis28.

Author Manuscript

A subset of tumors (15%) without IGF2 amplification also had dramatically higher levels
(as much as 100X) of IGF2 gene expression, an effect not attributable to methylation
changes at the IGF2 promoter. To assess the context of IGF2 amplification/overexpression,
we systematically looked for mutually exclusive genomic events using the MEMo method29.
We found a pattern of near exclusivity (corrected p < 0.01) of IGF2 overexpression with
genomic events known to activate the PI3-K pathway (mutations of PIK3CA/PIK3R1 or
deletion/mutation of PTEN, Figure 3c, and Supplementary Table 5). The IRS2 gene, whose
product links IGF1R, the receptor for IGF2, with PI3-K, is on chromosome 13, which is

frequently gained in colorectal cancer. Those cases with the highest IRS2 expression were
mutually exclusive of the cases with IGF2 overexpression (p= 0.04) and also lacked
mutations in the PI3-K pathway (p= 0.0001)(Figure 3c). Those results strongly suggest that
the IGF2/IGF1R/IRS2 axis signals to PI3-K in CRC and imply that therapeutic targeting of
the pathway could act to block PI3-K activity in this subset of patients.
Translocations

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To identify novel chromosomal translocations, we performed low-pass, paired-end, wholegenome sequencing on 97 tumors with matched normals. In each case we achieved sequence
coverage of ~3–4X and a corresponding physical coverage of 7.5–10X. Despite the low
genome coverage, we detected 250 candidate inter-chromosomal translocation events (range
0–10/tumor). Among those events, 212 had one or both breakpoints in an intergenic region,
whereas the remaining 38 juxtaposed coding regions of two genes in putative fusion events,
of which 18 were predicted to code for in-frame events (Supplementary Table 6). We found
three separate cases in which the first two exons of the NAV2 gene on chromosome 11 are
joined with the 3’ coding portion of TCF7L1 on chromosome 2 (Supplementary Figure 5).
TCF7L1 encodes TCF3, a member of the TCF/LEF class of transcription factors that
heterodimerize with nuclear β-catenin to enable β-catenin-mediated transcriptional
regulation. Intriguingly, in all three cases, the predicted structure of the NAV2-TCF7L1
fusion protein lacks the TCF3 β-catenin binding domain. This translocation is similar to
another recurrent translocation identified in CRC, a fusion in which the amino terminus of
VTI1A is joined to TCF4 that is encoded by TCF7L2, deleted or mutated in 12% of nonhypermutated tumors and a homolog of TCF7L14. We also observed 21 cases of
translocation involving TTC28 located on Chromosome 22 (Supplementary Table 6). In all
cases the fusions predict inactivation of TTC28, which has been identified as a target of p53
and an inhibitor of tumor cell growth30. Eleven of the 19 (58%) gene-gene translocations are
validated by either obtaining PCR products and in some case sequencing the junction
fragments (Supplementary Figure 5).
Altered pathways in CRC
Integrated analysis of mutations, copy-number, and mRNA expression changes in 195
tumors with complete data enriched our understanding of how some well-defined pathways
are deregulated. We grouped samples by hypermutation status and identified recurrent
alterations in the WNT, MAPK, PI3K, TGF-β and p53 pathways (Figure 4, Supplementary
Figure 6, Supplementary Table 1).

Author Manuscript

We found that the WNT signaling pathway was altered in 93% of all tumors, including
biallelic inactivation of APC (Supplementary Table 7) or activating mutations of CTNNB1 in
~80% of cases. There were also mutations in SOX9 and mutations and deletions in TCF7L2,
as well as the DKK family members and AXIN2, FBXW7 (Supplementary Figure 7),
ARID1A and FAM123B/WTX (the latter a negative regulator of WNT/β-catenin signaling12
found mutated in Wilm’s tumor31). A few mutations in FAM123B/WTX have been described
in colorectal cancer32. SOX9 has been suggested to play a role in cancer, but no mutations
have previously been described. The WNT receptor Frizzled (FZD10) was overexpressed in
~17% of samples, in some instances at levels 100X normal. Altogether, we found 16

different altered WNT pathway genes, confirming the importance of that pathway in CRC.
Interestingly, many of those alterations were found in tumors that harbor APC mutations,
suggesting that multiple lesions affecting the WNT signaling pathway confer selective
advantage.

Author Manuscript

Genetic alterations in the PI3K and RAS-MAPK pathways are common in CRC. In addition
to IGF2 and IRS2 overexpression, we found mutually exclusive mutations in PIK3R1 and
PIK3CA as well as deletions in PTEN in 2%, 15% and 4% of non-hypermutated tumors,
respectively. We found that 55% of non-hypermutated tumors have alterations in KRAS,
NRAS or BRAF, with a significant pattern of mutual exclusivity (Supplementary Figure 6,
Supplementary Table 1). We also evaluated mutations in the ERBB family of receptors
because of the translational relevance of such mutations. Mutations or amplifications in one
of the four genes are present in 22/165 (13%) non-hypermutated and 16/30 (53%)
hypermutated cases. Some of the mutations are listed in the COSMIC database33, suggesting
a functional role. Intriguingly, recurrent V842I ERBB2 and V104M ERBB3 mutations were
found in four and two non-hypermutated cases, respectively. Mutations and focal
amplifications of ERBB2 (Supplementary Figure 6) should be evaluated as predictors of
response to agents that target those receptors. We observed co-occurrence of alterations
involving the RAS and PI3K pathways in a third of tumors (Figure 4; Fisher’s exact test p =
0.039). These results suggest that simultaneous inhibition of the RAS and PI3K pathways
may be required to achieve therapeutic benefit.

Author Manuscript

The TGF-β signaling pathway is known to be deregulated in colorectal and other cancers34.
We found genomic alterations in TGFBR1, TGFBR2, ACVR2A, ACVR1B, SMAD2, SMAD3
and SMAD4 in 27% of the non-hypermutated and 87% of the hypermutated tumors. We also
evaluated the p53 pathway, finding alterations in TP53 in 59% of non-hypermutated cases
(mostly biallelic, Supplementary Table 8) and alterations in ATM, a kinase that
phosphorylates and activates p53 following DNA damage, in 7%. Alterations in those two
genes showed a trend towards mutual exclusivity (p = 0.016) (Figure 4, Supplementary
Figure 6, Supplementary Table 1).

Author Manuscript

We integrated copy number, gene expression, methylation and pathway data using the
PARADIGM software platform35. The analysis revealed a number of novel characteristics
of CRC (Figure 5A). For example, despite the diversity in anatomical origin or mutation
levels, nearly 100% of these tumors have changes in MYC transcriptional targets, both those
promoted by and those inhibited by MYC. These findings are consistent with patterns
deduced from genetic alterations (Figure 4) and suggest an important role for MYC in the
CRC. The analysis also identified several gene networks altered across all tumor samples
and those with differential alterations in hypermutated vs. non-hypermutated samples
(Supplementary Table 7, Supplemental Data on the TCGA publication webpage).
Since most of the tumors used in this study were derived from prospective collection,
survival data are not available. However, the tumors can be classified as aggressive or nonaggressive on the basis of tumor stage, lymph node status, distant metastasis and vascular
invasion at the time of surgery. We found numerous molecular signatures associated with
tumor aggressiveness, a subset of which is shown in Figure 5B. They include specific focal

amplifications and deletions, and altered gene expression levels, including those of
SCN5A36, a reported regulator of colon cancer invasion (full list: Supplementary Tables 10–
11). Association with tumor aggressiveness is also observed in altered expression of
miRNAs and specific somatic mutations (APC, TP53, PIK3CA, BRAF, and FBXW7;
Supplementary Figure 8B). Mutations in FBXW7 (38 cases) and distant metastasis (32
cases) never co-occurred (p = 0.0019). Interestingly, a number of genomic regions have
multiple molecular associations with tumor aggressiveness that manifest as “clinicallyrelated genomic hotspots”. Examples of this are the region 20q13.12, which includes a focal
amplification and multiple genes correlating with tumor aggression, and the region 22q12.3,
containing APOL637 (Supplementary Figures 8–9).

Discussion
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

This comprehensive integrative analysis of 224 colorectal tumor/normal pairs provides a
number of insights into the biology of CRC and identifies potential therapeutic targets. To
identify possible biological differences in colon and rectum tumors we found, in the nonhypermutated tumors, irrespective of their anatomical origin, the same type of copy number,
expression profile, DNA methylation and miRNA changes. Over 94% of them had a
mutation in one or more members of the WNT signaling pathway, predominantly in APC.
However, there were some differences between tumors from the right colon and the
remaining sites. Hypermethylation was more common in the right colon, and three quarters
of hypermutated samples came from the same site, although not all of them had MSI (Figure
2). Why most of the hypermutated samples come from the right colon and why there are two
classes of tumors at this site is not known. The origins of the colon from embryonic midgut
and hindgut may provide an explanation. Since the survival of patients with high MSI
cancers are better and these cancers have hypermutation, mutation rate may be a better
prognostic indicator.

Author Manuscript

Whole exome sequencing and integrative analysis of genomic data provided further insights
into the pathways that are dysregulated in CRC. We found that 93% of non-hypermutated
and 97% of hypermutated cases had deregulated WNT signaling pathway. Novel findings
included recurrent mutations in FAM123B, ARID1A and SOX9 and very high levels of
overexpression of the WNT ligand receptor Frizzled 10. To our knowledge, SOX9 has not
previously been described as frequently mutated in any human cancer. SOX9 is
transcriptionally repressed by WNT signaling, and the SOX9 protein has been shown to
facilitate β-catenin degradation38. ARID1A is frequently mutated in gynecological cancers
and has been shown to suppress Myc transcription39. Activation of WNT signaling and
inactivation of the TGF-β signaling pathway are known to result in activation of MYC. Our
mutational and integrative analyses emphasize the critical role of MYC in CRC. We also
compared our results with other large-scale analyses6 and find many similarities and few
differences in mutated genes (Supplementary Table 3).
Our integrated analysis revealed a diverse set of changes in TCF/LEF encoding genes
suggesting additional roles for TCF/LEF factors in CRC beyond being passive partners for
β-catenin.

Our data suggest a number of therapeutic approaches to CRC. Included are WNT signaling
inhibitors and small-molecule β-catenin inhibitors that are showing initial promise40–42. We
find that several proteins in the RTK/RAS and PI3K pathways including IGF2, IGFR,
ERBB2, ERBB3, MEK, AKT and mTOR could be targets for inhibition.

Author Manuscript

Our analyses show that non-hypermutated adenocarcinomas of the colon and rectum are not
distinguishable at the genomic level. However, tumors from the right/ascending colon were
more likely to be hypermethylated and to have elevated mutation rates than were other
CRCs. As has been recognized previously, activation of the WNT signaling pathway and
inactivation of the TGF-β signaling pathway, resulting in increased activity of MYC, are
nearly ubiquitous events in CRC. Genomic aberrations frequently target the MAPK and PI3K pathways but less frequently target receptor tyrosine kinases. In conclusion, the data
presented here provide an unprecedented resource for understanding this deadly disease and
identifying possibilities for treating it in a targeted way.

Methods Summary
Tumor and normal samples were processed by either of two Biospecimen Core Resources
(BCRs), and aliquots of purified nucleic acids were shipped to the genome characterization
and sequencing centers (Supplementary Methods). The BCRs provided sample sets in
several different batches. To assess any batch effects we examined the mRNA expression,
miRNA expression and DNA methylation data sets using a combination of cluster analysis,
enhanced principal component analysis, and analysis of variance (Supplementary Methods).
Although some differences among batches were detected, we did not correct them
computationally because the differences were generally modest and because some of them
may reflect biological phenomena (Supplementary Methods).

Author Manuscript

We used Affymetrix SNP 6.0 microarrays to detect copy-number alterations. A subset of
samples was subjected to low pass (2–5X) whole genome sequencing (Illumina HiSeq), in
part for detection of SCNA and chromosomal translocations43,44. Gene expression profiles
were generated using Agilent microarrays and RNA-Seq. DNA methylation data were
obtained using Illumina Infinium (HumanMethylation27) arrays. DNA sequencing of coding
regions was performed by exome capture followed by sequencing on the SOLiD or Illumina
HiSeq platforms. Details of the analytical methods used are described in Supplementary
Methods.

Hypermutated tumors have near diploid genomes and are highly enriched for
hypermethylation, CIMP expression phenotype, and BRAF V600E mutations. Nonhypermutated tumors originating from different sites are virtually indistinguishable from
each other based on their copy-number alteration patterns, DNA methylation, or gene
expression patterns. Copy-number changes of the 22 autosomes are shown in shades of red
for copy-number gains and shades of blue for copy-number losses.

Figure 3. Copy number changes and structural aberrations in CRC

Author Manuscript

A. Focal amplification of 11p15.5. Segmented DNA copy-number data from SNP arrays and
low pass whole genome sequencing are shown. Each row represents a patient; amplified
regions are shown in red. B. Correlation of expression levels with copy number changes for
IGF2 and miR-483. C. IGF2 amplification and over-expression are mutually exclusive of
alterations in PI3K signaling genes. D. Recurrent NAV2-TCF7L2 fusions. The structure of
the two genes, locations of the breakpoints leading to the translocation and circular
representations of all rearrangements in tumors with a fusion are shown. The red line lines
represent the NAV2-TCF7L2 fusions, black lines indicate other rearrangements. The inner
ring represents copy-number changes (blue = loss, pink = gain).

Figure 4. Diversity and frequency of genetic changes leading to deregulation of signaling
pathways in CRC

Non-hypermuated (n = 165) and hypermutated (n = 30) samples with complete data were
analyzed separately. Alterations are defined by somatic mutations, homozygous deletions,
high-level, focal amplifications, and, in some cases, by significant up- or down-regulation of
gene expression (IGF2, FZD10, SMAD4). Alteration frequencies are expressed as a
percentage of all cases; activated genes are red and inactivated genes are blue. The bottom
panel shows for each sample if at least one gene in each of the five pathways is altered.

Figure 5. Integrative analyses of multiple data sets

Author Manuscript

A. Clustering of genes and pathways affected in colon and rectum tumors deduced by
PARADIGM analysis. Blue = under-expressed relative to normal and red = overexpressed
relative to normal. Some of the pathways deduced by this method are shown on the right. B.
Gene expression signatures and SCNAs associated with tumor aggression. Molecular
signatures (rows) that show statistically significant association with tumor aggressiveness
according to selected clinical assays (columns) are displayed in color, with red indicating
markers of tumor aggressiveness, and blue the markers of less aggressive tumors.
Significance is based on the combined p-value from the weighted Fisher’s method, corrected
for multiple testing. Color intensity and score is in accordance with the strength of an
individual clinical-molecular association, and is proportional to log10(p), where p is p-value
for that association. To limit the vertical extent of the figure, gene expression signatures are
restricted to combined p-value p<10−9, SCNAs to p<10−7 and features are shown only if
they are also significant in the subset of non-MSI-H samples (the analysis was performed
separately on the full data as well as on the MSI-H and non-MSI-H subgroups).
