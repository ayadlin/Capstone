Abstract
Pyrrolo-1,5-benzoxazepine-15 (PBOX-15) is a novel microtubule depolymerization agent that induces cell cycle arrest
and subsequent apoptosis in a number of cancer cell lines.
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by
clonal expansion of predominately nonproliferating mature
B cells. Here, we present data suggesting PBOX-15 is a potential therapeutic agent for CLL. We show activity of PBOX-15 in
samples taken from a cohort of CLL patients (n = 55) representing both high-risk and low-risk disease. PBOX-15 exhibited cytotoxicity in CLL cells (n = 19) in a dose-dependent
manner, with mean IC50 of 0.55 μmol/L. PBOX-15 significantly
induced apoptosis in CLL cells (n = 46) including cells with
poor prognostic markers: unmutated IgVH genes, CD38 and
zeta-associated protein 70 (ZAP-70) expression, and fludarabine-resistant cells with chromosomal deletions in 17p. In
addition, PBOX-15 was more potent than fludarabine in inducing apoptosis in fludarabine-sensitive cells. Pharmacologic inhibition and small interfering RNA knockdown of
caspase-8 significantly inhibited PBOX-15–induced apoptosis.
Pharmacologic inhibition of c-jun NH2-terminal kinase inhibited PBOX-15–induced apoptosis in mutated IgVH and ZAP-70−
CLL cells but not in unmutated IgVH and ZAP-70+ cells. PBOX15 exhibited selective cytotoxicity in CLL cells compared with
normal hematopoietic cells. Our data suggest that PBOX-15 represents a novel class of agents that are toxic toward both
high-risk and low-risk CLL cells. The need for novel treatments
is acute in CLL, especially for the subgroup of patients with
poor clinical outcome and drug-resistant disease. This study
identifies a novel agent with significant clinical potential.

organs, and blood (1). It is believed that CLL is primarily due to
defects in apoptotic mechanisms in malignant cells rather than defects in control of lymphoproliferation, although this is the subject
of some reevaluation (2). The clinical course of CLL is heterogeneous, with some patients displaying stable disease, which often
requires no treatment other than “watchful waiting,” whereas other
patients have aggressive disease necessitating early intervention.
Several poor prognostic markers have been identified, including
presence of unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain genes (UIgVH), cell surface CD38 expression, cytoplasmic zeta-associated
protein 70 (ZAP-70) expression, and chromosomal abnormalities
such as deletion in 17p (del17p) and del11q23. In contrast, favorable
outcome is associated with presence of del13q and mutated IgVH
(M-IgVH). Current treatment paradigms for CLL involve use of alkylating agents, such as fludarabine, and monoclonal antibodies
(mAb; ref. 3).
Pyrrolo-1,5-benzoxazepines (PBOX) are a family of novel compounds, which we have previously shown to induce cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis in leukemia cell lines (4, 5) and inhibit tumor growth
in an in vivo breast carcinoma model (6). More recently, we have
shown that two of the more active members of the family, pyrrolo1,5-benzoxazepine-6 (PBOX-6) and pyrrolo-1,5-benzoxazepine-15
(PBOX-15), cause depolymerization of microtubules and disassembly of tubulin in vitro (7).
Microtubules, key components of the cytoskeleton, are extremely important in mitosis and cell division and are therefore
an important target for anticancer drugs. A chemically diverse
group of antimitotic drugs target microtubules and have been
used with great success in the treatment of cancer (8). These can
be broadly classified either as tubulin polymerizers (e.g., taxanes) or
depolymerizers (the Vinca alkaloids, colchicines, and nocodazole).
Proliferating cancer cells treated with microtubule targeting agents
(MTA) arrest in the G2-M phase of the cell cycle and eventually
undergo apoptotic cell death. Several well-characterized MTAs
have been shown to induce apoptosis in CLL cells, including colchicine (9, 10), vincristine (11), and nocodazole (12), as well as novel
agents with microtubule targeting activity (13, 14). There seems to
be a specific effect of microtubule depolymerization agents in CLL,
as Taxol has been reported not to induce apoptosis in CLL cells
(12). The mechanism by which MTAs induce apoptosis in CLL is
unclear. As circulating CLL cells are noncycling, the mechanism
of action cannot be accounted for by induction of mitotic arrest.
However, microtubules have been shown to be involved in B-cell
receptor signaling via interaction of tubulin with the tyrosine kinase

PBOX-15 Induces Apoptosis in CLL Cells

Syk and downstream signaling molecules Cbl and Vav (15). B-cell
receptor signaling differs between the IgVH subgroups of CLL cells,
with U-IgVH cells exhibiting signal transduction following crosslinking of B-cell receptor, whereas cells with M-IgVH are unresponsive (16). This difference in B-cell receptor signaling may be due to
ZAP-70, a critical T-cell receptor–associated tyrosine kinase (17),
which is associated with U-IgVH (18).
In this study, we show that PBOX-15 potently and selectively
induces apoptosis in CLL cells. We show that PBOX-15 is equipotent in poor prognostic subgroups of CLL (CD38+, ZAP-70+,
and U-IgVH genes), including fludarabine-resistant cells with
del17p. We investigated the mechanism of action and show
that PBOX-15–induced apoptosis occurs via a caspase-8–
dependent mechanism. In addition, we suggest a role for c-jun
NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK) activation in PBOX-15–induced
apoptosis in cells with favorable prognostic indicators (M-IgV H
and ZAP-70−).

Materials and Methods
PBOX-15. PBOX-15 [pyrrolobenzoxazepine 4-acetoxy-5-(1-naphthyl)
naphtha pyrrolo[1,4]-oxazepine; Fig. 1A] was synthesized as described previously (19, 20).

Patient samples and cell lines. Fifty-five patients referred to St.
James's Hospital, Dublin were recruited to this study. All patients exhibited
morphologic and immunophenotypic criteria of CLL (CD5/19+, CD23+,
FMC7−, weak surface immunoglobulin, and light chain restriction), had
stage A disease, and had not undergone previous treatment. Written informed consent was obtained before blood collection. In a concurrent
study (21), we analyzed IgVH mutational status, karyotype, and CD38
and ZAP-70 expression in a subset of these patients (Table 1). Blood
and bone marrow were also obtained from healthy donors. The study
was approved by the St. James's Hospital and Adelaide and Meath incorporating the National Children's Hospital Ethics Committee. Peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from herparinized peripheral blood by Lymphoprep (Axis-Shield) density gradient centrifugation
and incubated in RPMI 1640 with Glutamax supplemented with 10%
FCS, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen;
complete medium). EBV-transformed CLL cell lines, PGA1 (M-IgVH) and
HG3 (U-IgVH), were obtained from Prof. Anders Rosén (Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden; ref. 23). Cell lines were maintained in complete
media without antibiotics.
Granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit assay of bone marrow progenitor cells. The colony-forming potential of normal donor
bone marrow progenitor cells was assessed using granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (CFU-GM) assays. Bone marrow mononuclear
cells were isolated as described above. Mononuclear cells (1 × 106) were
incubated with PBOX-15 in 1 mL of complete medium. After incubation,
a 200-μL aliquot was removed and added to 1.8 mL of CFU-GM Metho‐
Cult methylcellulose medium (StemCell Technologies) and plated in triplicate in 2-cm2 cell culture dishes. Colonies with ≥30 cells were counted
after 14 d.
Viability and apoptosis assays. An MTT assay (Roche) was used to
quantify cell viability. PBMCs (1 × 106) were seeded in 96-well plates, and
MTT assay was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol. IC50
values were calculated using GraphPad Prism version 4.
Apoptosis was quantified by Annexin V binding assays as described
previously (24). PBMCs (5 × 106) or PGA1 and HG3 cells (5 × 105) were
treated with PBOX-15, 2-fluoroadenine-9-β-D-arabinofuranoside (fludarabine), or nocodazole (Sigma-Aldrich) in 1 mL of complete medium in
24-well plates. Caspase and JNK inhibitors (Calbiochem) were added
1 h before treatment. At the appropriate time point, cells were stained
with Annexin V-FITC (IQ Products) and propidium iodide (PI; Molecular
Probes) before collection of data via flow cytometry and analysis by
CellQuest software (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences). Apoptosis in normal
donor B cells was assessed by incubation of PBMCs with phycoerythrinlabeled CD19 antibody (BD Biosciences) and subsequent analysis of
Annexin V binding in CD19+ B cells. Mitochondrial integrity was assessed by incubating cells with the membrane potential–sensitive dye
rhodamine-123 (Molecular Probes; 50 ng/mL in complete medium) for
30 min and analysis by flow cytometry.
Caspase-8 knockdown. PGA1 cells (4 × 105) were incubated with 1
μmol/L Accell SMARTpool caspase-8 small interfering RNA (siRNA) or
Accell nontargeting siRNA pool (Dharmacon) in 1 mL Accell siRNA delivery
medium containing 3% FCS in 24-well plates. Following incubation for 72 h,
PBOX-15 was added and cells were incubated for a further 16 h before analysis of caspase-8 expression by immunoblotting and of apoptosis induction
by Annexin V/PI staining.
Protein analysis. Immunoblotting of whole-cell lysates was done as previously described (25). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred
onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). After probing for Bcl-2
(mouse mAb; Calbiochem), caspase-8 (mouse mAb; Cell Signaling), or phospho-JNK (rabbit mAb; Cell Signaling), blots were incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody. All
membranes were reprobed with anti-actin antibody to confirm equal loading.
Staining of microtubules. Following treatment, cells were cytospun,
air-dried, and fixed in 100% methanol. Fixed cells were stained with
anti–α-tubulin mouse mAb (clone DM1A), FITC-conjugated goat antimouse secondary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich), and Hoechst 33258 (Molecular
Probes) as described previously (26). Projected images from a z-series of

images were captured using Olympus 1X81 microscope coupled with Fluoview Ver 1.5 software (Olympus).
Statistical analysis. Differences in apoptosis between treated and untreated cells were analyzed by Student's t test. Association between prognostic markers and apoptosis was analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test and
Fisher's exact test. Correlations were determined by Pearson's method. For
all tests, P < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results
PBOX-15 is cytotoxic to CLL cells and disrupts CLL cell
microtubules. Initially, we investigated the cytotoxic effects of
PBOX-15 using an MTT assay. As CLL cells are growth arrested
in G0-G1 (data not shown), this assay quantifies cell viability and
not proliferation. Cell viability was determined after treatment
with a range of PBOX-15 concentrations (3 nmol/L–10 μmol/L)
for up to 72 hours (Fig. 1B), and a sigmoidal dose response
allowed cytotoxicity to be expressed as an IC50 value. In this
typical result, maximal PBOX-15–induced cytotoxicity was induced after 48 hours; however, there was no significant increase
in IC50 values after 24 hours. In 19 patient samples analyzed,

IC 50 values ranged between 0.18 and 1.1 μmol/L (mean,
0.55 μmol/L; Fig. 1C). We have previously shown that PBOX-15
targets tubulin polymerization in cancer cell lines and T lymphoctyes (7, 27). To determine whether PBOX-15 exerts a similar
effect on CLL cells, the microtubule architecture was analyzed.
Control cells exhibited an organized microtubule network radiating from the centrosome. However, following treatment with
1 μmol/L PBOX-15 for 24 hours, this microtubule organization
was completely disrupted with markedly decreased tubulin
staining (Fig. 1D).
PBOX-15 induces apoptosis in CLL cells. Next, we investigated the type of cell death mediated by PBOX-15. CLL cells isolated
from 11 patients were treated with 0.1 to 10 μmol/L of PBOX-15
for 24 and 48 hours, and a dose response induction of apoptosis
was observed (Fig. 2A). Significant induction of apoptosis was induced in cells treated with 1 μmol/L PBOX-15 for 24 hours, with
no further significant increase observed following treatment for 48
hours. Analysis of 46 patients' samples showed that 1 μmol/L
PBOX-15 significantly induced apoptosis in CLL cells (Fig. 2B). Although there was a wide range in both spontaneous (3–43%) and
PBOX-15–induced apoptosis (22–90%), apoptosis increased in

every CLL sample following treatment (range of increase, 9–79%;
median increase, 48%). Importantly, PBOX-15 induced similar levels of apoptosis in cells with markers for poor clinical outcome:
U-IgVH (Fig. 2Ci), CD38+ (Fig. 2Cii), ZAP-70+ (Fig. 2Ciii), and del17p
(Fig. 2Civ). There was no correlation between spontaneous or
PBOX-15–induced apoptosis and karyotypic status, IgVH mutational status, or CD38 or ZAP-70 expression. PBOX-15 induced apoptosis in two CLL cell lines: PGA1 (M-IgVH) and HG3 (U-IgVH;
Fig. 2D).
PBOX-15 has reduced toxicity in normal hematopoietic
cells. We investigated the effects of PBOX-15 on normal bone marrow donor progenitor cells using a CFU-GM assay. CFU-GM assays
are physiologically relevant toxicology models that have a high predictive ability to detect myelosuppression due to chemotherapeutic agents (28). The effects of exposure of bone marrow progenitor
cells isolated from three normal donors to 1 and 5 μmol/L PBOX15 for up to 72 hours are shown in Fig. 3Ai–iii. There was a wide
range of colony-forming ability between donor bone marrow pro-

genitor cells following treatment, reflecting the heterogeneity of
the donors. Treatment with 1 μmol/L PBOX-15 for 24 hours resulted in no significant decrease in colony-forming ability in any
of the three donor samples. Further analysis of another five normal
bone marrow donor samples showed that, whereas colony-forming
ability was reduced in four of eight samples following 1 μmol/L
PBOX-15 treatment for 24 hours, the overall colony-forming ability
was not significantly reduced following treatment (Fig. 3Aiv). This
relatively low cytotoxicity in normal bone marrow progenitor cells
may be due to these cells recovering from PBOX-15–induced cell
cycle arrest, resulting in no sustained effect on proliferative capacity. However, these results suggest that prolonged exposure to
PBOX-15 may have significant cytotoxic effects on bone marrow
progenitor cells. Further studies, including the use of animal models, are required before the bone marrow toxicity of PBOX-15 can
be fully assessed. We also investigated whether PBOX-15 exhibited
selective apoptosis induction in CLL cells compared with normal B
cells. No significant increase in apoptosis was detected in B cells

PBOX-15 Induces Apoptosis in CLL Cells

following treatment with 1 μmol/L PBOX-15 for up to 72 hours
(Fig. 3B).
PBOX-15 is more potent than fludarabine in inducing apoptosis in CLL cells. As the purine analogue fludarabine is a frontline agent in CLL therapy, we compared the sensitivity of CLL cells
to PBOX-15 and fludarabine. Fludarabine-induced apoptosis was
assessed using 2-fluoroadenine-9-β-D-arabinofuranoside, the active

Figure 4. PBOX-15 is more potent than fludarabine in inducing apoptosis in
CLL cells. A, CLL cells isolated from patient #47 were treated with 1 μmol/L
PBOX-15 or the indicated concentrations of fludarabine for the indicated time
points and apoptosis was measured by Annexin V/PI assay. B, CLL cells isolated
from 14 patients were treated for 24 h with 1 μmol/L PBOX-15 or the indicated
fludarabine concentrations, and apoptosis was measured as above. PBOX-15
induced significantly greater apoptosis than 50 μmol/L fludarabine (P < 0.02).
C, CLL cells, harboring a del17p, isolated from three patients were treated either
with 1 μmol/L PBOX-15 or with 20 or 50 μmol/L fludarabine and apoptosis
was measured as above.

nucleoside form of fludarabine. A typical result comparing the
effects of PBOX-15 and fludarabine shows that 1 μmol/L PBOX-15
is more potent than the therapeutically relevant concentration of
20 μmol/L fludarabine (29) in inducing apoptosis up to 72 hours
(Fig. 4A). PBOX-15 at 1 μmol/L was significantly more potent in
inducing apoptosis after 24 hours compared with 50 μmol/L fludarabine (P < 0.02, n = 14; Fig. 4B). Del17p results in loss of expression of
p53 and is associated with short survival time and resistance to purine analogues, such as fludarabine (30, 31). The three samples with
del17p were assessed for fludarabine- and PBOX-15–induced apoptosis after 24 hour treatment (Fig. 4C). Del17p cells exhibited complete resistance to spontaneous and fludarabine-induced apoptosis
(levels of apoptosis <10%). However, del17p cells were sensitive to
PBOX-15–induced apoptosis with levels of apoptosis ranging from
25% to 63%.
Mechanism of PBOX-15–induced apoptosis in CLL cells involves activation of caspase-8. To investigate the mechanism of
PBOX-15–induced apoptosis in CLL cells, we investigated the effect
of PBOX-15 on mitochondrial membrane depolarization, which is
indicative of activation of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. We
show mitochondrial membrane depolarization at 24 hours, but not
at 2 hours, after treatment with PBOX-15 (Supplementary Fig. S1),
suggesting that activation of this apoptotic pathway is not an early
event in PBOX-15–induced apoptosis.
We have previously shown that proapoptotic PBOX compounds result in phosphorylation and inactivation of the anti‐
apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in a number of cancer cell lines (26, 32).
Bcl-2 is phosphorylated in unstressed cells undergoing mitosis;
however, hyperphosphorylation of Bcl-2 occurs in response to treatment with MTAs (33), including nonproliferating CLL cells (12, 34).
Accordingly, we investigated phosphorylation and expression levels
of Bcl-2 in CLL cells following treatment with PBOX-15 (Fig. 5A). No
change in protein levels of Bcl-2 was detected in any of four patient
samples following 24 hours of treatment with PBOX-15. Treatment
of the chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 with PBOX-15
resulted in extensive phosphorylation of Bcl-2; however, no phosphorylation was detected in PBOX-15–treated CLL samples, suggesting that PBOX-15–induced apoptosis occurs independent
of Bcl-2.
Previously, we showed that PBOX-6 can induce either caspasedependent or caspase-independent apoptosis depending on the
cell type (4, 25). To investigate the role of caspases in mediating
PBOX-15–induced apoptosis in CLL cells, we used a series of
specific pharmacologic inhibitors of caspase activity (Fig. 5B).
Pretreatment of cells with the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VADfmk significantly inhibited PBOX-15–induced apoptosis (n = 21,
P < 0.0001), suggesting a requirement for caspase activity. Interestingly, pretreatment with caspase-3 inhibitor, Ac-DMQD-CHO,
and caspase-9 inhibitor, Ac-LEHD-CMK, had no significant effect,
whereas caspase-8 inhibitor, z-IETD-fmk, significantly abrogated
PBOX-15–induced apoptosis (n = 8, P < 0.003; Fig. 5Bi). Pretreatment of the CLL cell line PGA1 with z-VAD-fmk and z-IETD-fmk
significantly inhibited PBOX-15–induced apoptosis (Fig. 5Bii).
The tubulin depolymerization agent nocodazole has been shown
to induce apoptosis in CLL cells primarily by activation of
caspase-9 (12), and here, we show that z-VAD-fmk and AcLEHD-CMK significantly inhibit nocodazole-induced apoptosis
in PGA1 cells. To confirm the requirement for caspase-8 activation
in PBOX-15–induced apoptosis, we used siRNA to knock down
expression in PGA1 cells. We achieved partial knockdown of
caspase-8 and observed significant inhibition of PBOX-15–induced

apoptosis compared with control siRNA–transfected cells
(Fig. 5C). In addition, immunoblot analysis of caspase-8 in six
patient samples undergoing PBOX-15–induced apoptosis
showed down-regulation of full-length procaspase-8 in five
CLL samples (nos. 15, 20, 26, 28, and 40) and increased detection
of cleaved caspase-8 fragments in three samples (nos. 28, 37, and
40), suggesting PBOX-15–induced activation of caspase-8 in these
cells (Fig. 5D).

PBOX-15–induced apoptosis is JNK dependent in low-risk
CLL and JNK independent in high-risk CLL. JNK has been
reported to be constitutively activated in CLL (35), and we have
previously shown a requirement for early activation of JNK in apoptosis induced by PBOX-6 in several leukemic cell lines (36). To
investigate a role for JNK activation in PBOX-15–induced apoptosis
in CLL cells, we pretreated cells with the specific JNK inhibitor
SP600125 before incubation with PBOX-15 (Fig. 6A). Inhibition

PBOX-15 Induces Apoptosis in CLL Cells

with 1 μmol/L PBOX-15 or pretreated for 1 h with 25 μmol/L SP600125 (JNK inhibitor) before incubation with PBOX-15. Apoptosis was measured after 24 h by the Annexin

of JNK activity significantly inhibited PBOX-15–induced apoptosis
(n = 17, P < 0.0005). However, a large heterogeneity in the inhibition
of apoptosis was observed. Interestingly, when samples were subgrouped according to IgVH mutational status and ZAP-70 expression, it was observed that JNK inhibition completely inhibited
apoptosis in M-IgVH and ZAP-70− cells (P < 0.0006 and P < 0.001,
respectively) while having little effect on U-IgVH and ZAP-70+ cells
(Fig. 6B). As expected, there was a high level of concordance with
IgVH mutational status and ZAP-70 expression (eight of nine patients with M-IgVH were ZAP-70− and four of six patients with
U-IgVH were ZAP-70+). To confirm this role for JNK activation,
we used siRNA to knock down expression in PGA1 (M-IgVH) and
HG3 (U-IgVH) cells; however, we were unable to achieve satisfactory
knockdown of JNK using this approach (data not shown). This may
be due to our finding that pharmacologic inhibition of JNK induced
apoptosis in these cell lines (data not shown), suggesting that JNK
may have a role as a survival factor in proliferating CLL cells. We
detected activation of JNK following treatment with PBOX-15 in six
CLL patient samples by immunoblotting using a phospho-JNK
antibody (Fig. 6C). PBOX-15 seemed to selectively activate the
p46 JNK isoform because little phosphoylated p54 JNK was
detected. Increased activation of JNK was detected in CLL cells that
were either U-IgVH or ZAP-70+ compared with cells that were MIgVH and ZAP-70−.

Discussion
We have previously shown that PBOX-15, a novel tubulin depolymerization agent, causes disruption of the microtubule network
(7) and, similar to another tubulin depolymerization agent, nocodazole, induces mitotic arrest in G2-M before onset of apoptosis in
proliferating cell lines (26). However, microtubules are critical in
many cellular processes as well as cytokinesis, and therefore, disruption of microtubule dynamics is likely to result in significant cellular
effects. We recently showed that PBOX-15 inhibits integrinassociated T-lymphocyte migration (27), and other MTAs have been
shown to have anti-inflammatory properties (13, 37). Microtubules
are involved in B-cell signaling (15), and consequently, microtubule
disruption may influence B-cell survival. This led us to investigate
the activity of PBOX-15 in nonproliferating CLL cells.
We showed PBOX-15–induced destruction of microtubule structure in CLL cells, consistent with our previous findings that PBOX15 is a tubulin depolymerization agent (7, 27). We observed this
loss of microtubule architecture in all CLL cells treated with
PBOX-15, even though in some instances the number of cells undergoing apoptosis was less than 50%. This suggests that PBOX-15
disrupts microtubules in CLL cells through direct effects on
tubulin and not secondary to apoptosis induction. Indeed, our
previous work has shown decreased tubulin polymerization and

posttranslational modifications following PBOX-15 treatment in
lymphocytes (27).
Here, we show that PBOX-15 induced apoptosis in CLL cells,
including those with poor prognostic indicators: U-IgVH, CD38+,
and ZAP-70+. Of particular note is the sensitivity of del17p cells
to PBOX-15, resulting in loss of p53. These cells were resistant to
fludarabine-induced apoptosis but exhibited significant apoptosis
when exposed to PBOX-15. Cells without del17p underwent
fludarabine-induced apoptosis, but were more sensitive to PBOX15–induced apoptosis. These results suggest that fludarabineinduced apoptosis is p53 dependent, whereas PBOX-15–induced
apoptosis is primarily p53 independent. This is a relevant observation in the context of combating fludarabine resistance in high-risk
CLL patients.
The mechanism of PBOX-15–induced apoptosis in CLL seems to
be different from that of the tubulin depolymerization agent nocodazole. Here, we show that PBOX-15–induced apoptosis is caspase8 dependent, whereas nocodazole-induced apoptosis is caspase-9
dependent. In addition, nocodazole has been reported to have a
differential effect on Bcl-2 in CLL cells: decreasing Bcl-2 expression
in some samples and inducing phosphorylation in others after as
little as 1-hour exposure (12). However, we detected no changes in
expression levels or phosphorylation of Bcl-2 following treatment
with PBOX-15, although we cannot discount the possibility of an
earlier transient phosphorylation of Bcl-2 (38).
The inhibition of apoptosis by a caspase-8 inhibitor and siRNA
knockdown suggests caspase-8 activation as the primary mechanism of PBOX-15–induced apoptosis in CLL. Caspase-8 activation
is involved in the death receptor apoptotic pathway; however,
earlier evidence has suggested that this pathway is not functional
in CLL. CLL cells have been shown to be resistant to CD95/Fas
ligand– and tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing
ligand (TRAIL)–induced apoptosis (39, 40), and activation of
caspase-8 has been shown to be low in B-lymphocytic leukemia
cells (41). However, more recently, it has been reported that activation of caspase-8 can induce apoptosis and sensitize CLL cells
to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (42). Activation of a caspase-8–
dependent apoptosis pathway in CLL cells by PBOX-15 is potentially
very promising as it may overcome chemoresistance to fludarabine
and rituximab, which induce apoptosis via activation of caspase-9
and the mitochondrial pathway (43, 44).
Here, we provide evidence of a role for JNK activation in PBOX15–induced apoptosis in ex vivo CLL cells. Our results suggest that
this PBOX-15 effect is JNK dependent in M-IgVH and ZAP-70− cells
and JNK independent in U-IgVH and ZAP-70+ cells. We have previously shown a role for JNK-mediated phosphorylation and inactivation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, which is required for

PBOX-6–induced apoptosis in several leukemic cell lines (32). However, the role of JNK in PBOX-15–induced apoptosis in CLL cells
seems to be somewhat different: pharmacologic inhibition of JNK
resulted in apoptosis in CLL cell lines, and no evidence of PBOX15–induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation was seen in ex vivo CLL cells.
Although requiring further confirmation, this differential role for
JNK activation in high-risk and low-risk CLL is interesting. Although CLL cells have impaired signaling via the B-cell receptor
compared with normal B cells, U-IgVH and ZAP-70+ CLL cells have
increased B-cell receptor signaling in response to antigen stimulation compared with M-IgVH and ZAP-70− cells, suggesting that this
plays an important role in the clinical behavior of this disease (16,
45). Indeed, downstream JNK, extracellular signal–regulated kinase, and Akt activation has been reported to be more prevalent
in CLL cells with U-IgVH, compared with M-IgVH, following activation of the B-cell receptor (46), and here, we show greater relative
levels of JNK activation in cells that were either U-IgVH or ZAP-70+
compared with cells that were M-IgVH and ZAP-70−. Differences in
prosurvival signaling in the subgroups of CLL may be reflected in
the role of JNK in PBOX-15–induced apoptosis shown here. JNK
plays a complex role in B-cell survival (47); therefore, this role of
JNK in CLL may have further therapeutic significance.
Our data extend the anticancer activity of PBOX-15, a novel
tubulin-targeting agent, to primary CLL cells, indicating its ability
to induce apoptosis in a predominantly nonproliferating population of tumor cells. Importantly, PBOX-15 induces apoptosis in
CLL cells with poor prognostic markers, including fludarabineresistant cells with del17p, indicating its potential as an anticancer
agent in chemoresistant disease. Based on these data, novel tubulindepolymerizing agents with distinct mechanisms of action, such as
PBOX-15, may indicate new therapeutic approaches for treatment
of CLL and other malignancies characterized by low proliferation
rates.
