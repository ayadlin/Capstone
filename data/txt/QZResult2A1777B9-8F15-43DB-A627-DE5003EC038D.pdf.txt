BACKGROUND: XIAP-associated factor 1 (XAF1) antagonizes the anticaspase activity of XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of
apoptosis) and functions as a tumor suppressor in colon cancer. The tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing
ligand (TRAIL) is known as a potential anticancer agent. In this study, the synergistic effect of XAF1 and TRAIL on colon cancer growth was investigated. METHODS: Adeno-XAF1 virus was generated and purified. Cell apoptosis was
detected by flow-cytometry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay. Protein expression of the different genes was determined by Western blot analysis. Tumorigenesis and tumor growth
were assessed in subcutaneous nude mouse xenograft experiments. RESULTS: Stable overexpression of XAF1-sensitized colon cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis significantly increased the activity of caspase 3, 7, 8, and 9;
released cytochrome c; and down-regulated XIAP, survivin, and c-IAP-2. The restoration of XAF1 expression mediated
by adenovirus (adeno-XAF1) directly induced apoptosis, and synergized TRAIL-induced apoptosis in colon cancer
cells. Ex vivo transduction of adeno-XAF1 suppressed colon cancer formation in vivo. Furthermore, adeno-XAF1 treatment of mice significantly inhibited tumor growth, strongly enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis and antitumor activity
in colon cancer xenograft models in vivo, and markedly prolonged the survival. Notably, the combined treatment
with adeno-XAF1 and TRAIL completely eradicated the established tumors without detectable toxicity in normal tissue. CONCLUSIONS: The combined restoration of XAF1 expression and TRAIL treatment may be a potent strategy

Apoptosis is known to be a fundamental process for the elimination of defective or potentially damaged cells and

therefore provides a defense mechanism against malignant transformation and autoimmunity.1 Apoptosis has emerged as
a potential target for cancer treatment at various stages of tumorigenesis. The IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis) family belongs
to a new class of intrinsic cellular regulators of apoptosis that are structurally defined by the presence of an evolutionary
conserved BIR domain.2,3 The human IAP family includes cIAP-1, cIAP-2, XIAP, NAIP, survivin, Apollon, ILP2, and
Livin.2,3 Dysregulation of IAPs has been suggested to play a key role in the aberrantly increased cell viability and resistance
to cancer therapy in human cancers, whereas overexpression of IAPs appears to suppress apoptosis.3,4 Thus, the strategies
that targeting IAP synthesis or function are under investigation for the treatment of cancer. Both antisense5 and small molecule inhibitors of IAP function6,7 have shown promising results in animal models of human cancer.

XAF1 Inhibits Colon Cancer Growth/Tu et al

XIAP-associated factor 1 (XAF1) has previously
been identified as an X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis
(XIAP) binding partner.8 XAF1 directly interacts with endogenous XIAP and results in XIAP sequestration in nuclear inclusions. Transient overexpression of XAF1
sensitizes tumor cells to the proapoptotic effects of etoposide and antagonizes the XIAP-mediated inhibition of caspase 3 activity.8 XAF1 mRNA is expressed ubiquitously
in all normal adult and fetal tissues, in contrast to very low
or undetectable levels in various cancer cell lines.9
Reduced or absent XAF1 expression seems to be a frequent event in human cancer tissues.10-16 Moreover, loss
of XAF1 expression correlates strongly with tumor staging, implicating loss of XAF1 function in tumor progression.10-13 Although to our knowledge no formal CpG
islands have been identified in the immediate XAF1 50
upstream region, several studies have demonstrated that
hypermethylation of the XAF1 promoter is associated
with decreased expression of XAF1 in cancer cell lines and
primary carcinoma samples. Furthermore, the treatment
with the demethylating drug 5-aza-deoxycytidine restores
the expression of XAF1 in cancer cells.11-16 These data
suggest a role of XAF1 as a tumor suppressor gene.
Colon cancer is among the most commonly diagnosed malignancies and leading causes of cancer-related
mortality worldwide.17 Although early stage colon cancers
can be cured by surgery, advanced stage colon cancer often
recurs despite combination chemotherapy.17 Thus, new
strategies, such as those that target apoptosis, are required
to improve the dismal prognosis of colon cancer patients.
We and others have previously shown that the aberrant
hypermethylation of the CpG sites in XAF1 promoter is
strongly associated with decreased expression of XAF1 in
gastric and colon cancer. Furthermore, the decreased
expression of XAF1 is related to the development of colon
cancer and tumor stage.12,13 Thus, the restoration of
XAF1 expression might represent a strategy in colon cancer therapy.
The tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL), a member of TNF family, is
known for its unique properties to induce death of cancer
cells while sparing most normal cells.18 This implies its
use as a promising anticancer agent. TRAIL induces apoptosis via its cognate death receptors, DR4 and DR5,
which in turn results in the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex, and caspase 8 processing.18 Furthermore, TRAIL has been shown to induce apoptosis in
different colon cancer cell lines.19,20 Some studies have
indicated that overexpression of XAF1 can sensitize cancer

cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.21,22 We recently demonstrated that the restoration of XAF1 expression could
inhibit gastric cancer growth.23 However, to the best of
our knowledge, the therapeutic effect of the restoration of
XAF1 expression combined with TRAIL on colon cancer
growth in vivo has not been investigated. In this study, we
found that the combination of adeno-XAF1 virus and
TRAIL strongly enhanced the induction of apoptosis in
vivo, significantly inhibited tumor growth, markedly prolonged the survival time of animals, and completely eradicated established tumors without detectable toxicity in
normal tissue. Therefore, our results suggest that the combination of XAF1 and TRAIL might be a potent therapeutic approach for colon cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Lines and Cell Culture
Human colon cancer cell lines SW1116, Colo 205, HT29, Lovo, CTL-238, and CCl-2134 (ATCC, Rockville,
Md) were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (GIBCOBRL, Grand Island, NY) containing 10% fetal calf serum
(GIBCO-BRL), 2 mM L-glutamine (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, Md), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 lg/mL
streptomycin (BioWhittaker). All cell lines were maintained at 37 C and 5% carbon dioxide (CO2). TRAIL/
ApoL2 was purchased from PeproTech Inc (Rocky Hill,
NJ). Hydroxycamptothecin (WangSi Pharmaceutical
Corp, WangSi, China), arsenic trioxide (As2O3; Sigma
Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo) (0.5 lM), cisplatin
(2 lg/mL), 5-fluorouracil (10 lg/mL), and etoposide
(5 lg/mL; Pharmacia & Upjohn Limited Corp, Perth,
Australia) were solubilized in dimethylsulfoxide and
stored at 4 C.

XAF1 Plasmids and Transfections
The full-length XAF1 cDNA expression vector pcDNA3XAF1 has been described previously.8 A 300-bp portion
of the XAF1 cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3.1 in the
antisense orientation to serve as control in stable transfection experiments. Stable transfections were performed
using Lipofectamine 2000 (GIBCO), and stable transfectants were selected in 800 lg/mL of Geneticin (G418) for
SW1116 cells and 1000 lg/mL G418 for Colo 205 cells.
Stable clones were picked and characterized by Western
blot analysis, and maintained in medium containing 200
lg/mL G418 for further study.

Recombinant Adenoviruses
Recombinant adeno-XAF1 was constructed by blunt-end
ligation of the XAF1 coding region into the Swa 1 site of
the cosmid pAdex1CA. The cosmid was cotransfected
into 293 cells with Ad5dlX–TPC complex, and recombinant virus was plaque purified. Vectors, protocols, and
the construction of the reporter adenovirus expressing the
Escherichia coli b-galactosidase gene (adeno-lacZ) has
been described previously.8
Assay of Anchorage-Dependent and
Anchorage-Independent Cell Growth
Parental and stable transfected cell clones were seeded in
triplicate in 6-well plates (1  105 cells per well). Cells
from triplicate wells were collected every other day, and
cell numbers were determined using a Coulter counter
(Coulter Electronics, Miami, Fl).24 Parental and stable
transfectants (1  104 cells) were plated in triplicate in
complete culture medium containing 0.3% agar on top of
a 0.6% agar base containing the same medium. All dishes
were incubated at 37 C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Colonies were scored at 16 days postseeding as previously described.24
Cell Proliferation, Apoptosis, and Cell
Cycle Analysis
Parental cell and stable transfectants were plated onto 96well plates at a density of 1000 cells/well. Cells were harvested at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after seeding. Cell proliferation was measured by methylthiotetrazole assay.23,24 For
cell apoptosis, colon cancer was pretreated with and without specific caspase 3 inhibitors z-DVAD-fmk (20 lM),
caspase 8 inhibitor z-IETD-fmk (20 lM), caspase 9 inhibitor z-LEHD-fmk (20 lM), and pan-caspase inhibitor
z-VAD-fmk (40 lM) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
Minn) for 2 hours, and followed by infection of adenovirus (multiplicities of infection [MOI] ¼ 20) for 48 hours.
Cells were collected and fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol,
and apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry (Coulter,
Luton, UK).23,24 The cell-cycle phase distribution was
calculated from the resultant DNA histogram using Multicycle AV software (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego,
Calif). Cells with a subdiploid DNA content were scored
as apoptotic.
Western Blot Analysis
Cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mM Tris–HCl
(pH 7.5), 250 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP-40, 5 mM ethylene
glycol tetraacetic acid, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 60 mM

1254

b-glycerol-phosphate, 0.5 mM sodium-vanadate, 0.1
mM phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride, 10 lg/mL aprotinin,
and 10 lg/mL leupeptin. Protein samples were electrophoresed on 10% denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate gels,
and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore,
Bedford, Mass). The blots were incubated with specific
primary antibodies, a peroxidase-conjugated second antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif), and
observed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham, Piscataway, NJ). XIAP, survivin, c-IAP-1, c-IAP-2,
XAF1 polyclonal antibody, poly(ADP-ribose)/polymerase (PARP), cytochrome c, and b-actin were all obtained
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Caspase 3, 7, 8, and 9
antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology Corp. (Beverly, Mass).
Caspase Activity Assay
Caspase activity was measured using the Caspase Glo
Assay (Promega, Madison, Wis) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, 5 lg of total cellular protein from cell lysates was added to the proluminescent zIETD (caspase 8) substrate at a 1:1 ratio in a 100 lL volume and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour in the
dark. After incubation, luminescence was measured using
a Monolight 3010 luminometer (BD Pharmingen, Heidelberg, Germany). All samples were assayed in triplicate.
Luminescence was expressed as relative light units and is
proportional to the amount of caspase activity present in
the sample.
In Situ Detection of Apoptotic Cells by
Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl TransferaseMediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling Assay
Apoptosis in xenograft tumors was determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nickend labeling (TUNEL) staining using ApoAlert DNA
Fragmentation Assay Kit (Cat No. K2024-1, Clontech
Corp., Mountain View, Calif).25 Apoptotic cells exhibit
green nuclear fluorescence. Slides were stained with propidium iodide for cell nucleus staining for 5 to 10 minutes.
The percentage of apoptotic cells was assessed in 10 randomly selected fields viewed at 40 magnification. The
apoptotic index was calculated as number of apoptotic
cells/total number of nucleated cells  100%.

Tumor growth was measured every week after injection
until experimental endpoints were achieved. To examine
the short-term effects of XAF1 and/or TRAIL, a parallel
experiment was performed in which mice received an
injection of exponentially growing 2  106 SW1116
cells. After 7 days, mice were given an injection containing the same titer of adeno-XAF1 or adeno-LacZ and
TRAIL (3 animals/group). After 3 days, animals were
euthanized, and their tumors were excised, fixed, embedded in paraffin, stained with hematoxylin and eosin,
and TUNEL stained. Additional tumor biopsy samples
were lysed, and total protein was collected for Western
blot analysis.
Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as the mean  standard error of mean.
The significance of the difference between groups was

was used to analyze survival of tumor-bearing mice.

RESULTS
Overexpression of XAF1 Sensitizes Cancer
Cells to TRAIL-Induced and Drug-Induced
Apoptosis
We initiated these studies by examining 6 colon cancer
cell lines for the expression of XAF1 protein. Consistent
with previous reports, XAF1 protein expression in these
cell lines was low or undetectable (Fig. 2A).12,13 To assess
the effect of constitutive overexpression of XAF1 on the
characteristics of colon cancer cells in vitro, we established
stable transfectants with XAF1 sense and antisense plasmids. We chose 2 colon cancer cell lines, SW1116 and
Colo 205, expressing low levels of endogenous XAF1 protein. Transfection of both cell lines (SW1116 and Colo
205) with antisense or empty vector readily formed
G418-resistant, stable clones. Overexpression of exogenous XAF1 by the sense plasmid and down-regulation of
endogenous XAF1 by the antisense plasmid in stable
clones were confirmed by Western blot analysis in
SW1116 lines (Fig. 2B) and Colo 205 (data not shown).
To examine whether overexpression of XAF1 sensitizes colon cancer cells to drug-induced apoptosis, we
treated these stable transfectants with different anticancer
drugs. Overexpression of XAF1 potentiated TRAILinduced apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner
compared with vector control transfectants (Figs. 2C-E).
Furthermore, it markedly increased apoptosis induced by
multiple front-line anticancer drugs, including 5-fluo-

1256

rouracil, cisplatin, etoposide, hydroxycamptothecin, and
arsenic trioxide in SW1116 (Fig. 2F) and Colo 205 stable
transfectants (data not shown).
Overexpression of XAF1 Cooperated With
TRAIL Activates Intrinsic and Extrinsic
Apoptotic Pathway
To further explore the mechanism by which overexpression of XAF1 sensitizes cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, we detected the alteration in apoptotic signal
pathways induced by TRAIL in XAF1-overexpressing stable transfectants. We found that overexpression of XAF1
potentiated the activation of all caspases examined
(including caspase 3, 7, 9, and 8), and increased the development of markers of apoptosis such as cytosolic cytochrome c or PARP cleavage (Fig. 3A). To directly assess
caspase activity, we performed the caspase 8 activity assay.
The caspase 8 activity in the SW1116/XAF1 transfectants
was significantly higher than that in the SW111b/vector.
Furthermore, TRAIL treatment significantly enhanced
the caspase 8 activity in the SW1116/XAF1 transfectants
compared with that in the SW1116/vector transfectants
(Fig. 3B). The results confirm that overexpression of
XAF1 enhanced caspase 8 activity. Moreover, the caspase
8 inhibitor z-IETD-fmk and the caspase 9 inhibitor
z-LEHD-fmk partly abrogated TRAIL-induced apoptosis, whereas the caspase 3 inhibitor z-DEVD-fmk and a
broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk exhibited
stronger inhibition of apoptosis induced by TRAIL in
XAF1-overepressing stable transfectants (Fig. 3C). The
data further indicate that overexpression of XAF1 cooperates with TRAIL to activate intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. In addition, the caspase 8 inhibitor z-IETDfmk could significantly inhibit TRAIL-induced apoptosis
in the SW1116/vector, whereas the caspase 9 inhibitor
z-LEHD-fmk only slightly inhibited TRAIL-induced apoptosis in the SW1116/vector (Fig. 3C), consistent with
previous reports that TRAIL alone induces apoptosis
largely through activation of extrinsic apoptotic pathway.18 Furthermore, Western blot analysis also demonstrated that overexpression of XAF1 enhanced the effect
of TRAIL on down-regulation of XIAP, survivin, and
c-IAP-2 expression (Fig. 3D). The results showed that
overexpression of XAF1 appears to exacerbate apoptosis
by antagonizing the ability of IAPs to inhibit both
upstream and downstream caspase activation events, as
indicated by enhanced caspase 8 activation subsequent to
mitochondrial permeability in a feedback amplification

overexpression enhances the sensitivity of colon cancer
cells to apoptotic stimuli TRAIL.
Adeno-XAF1 Synergizes TRAIL-Induced
Apoptosis in Colon Cancer Cells
To examine whether expression of XAF1 mediated by adenovirus vector can directly induce apoptosis in colon cancer cells, we infected colon cancer cells with adeno-XAF1
and adeno-LacZ. Transduction with adeno-XAF1
induced apoptosis in colon cancer cells lines tested in a
time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A and data not
shown). We further confirmed that adeno-XAF1 transduction resulted in the appearance of apoptotic markers,

such as cleavage and activation of caspase 3, caspase 9, and
PARP; the release of cytochrome c; and the down-regulation of XIAP (Fig. 4B). Moreover, caspase 9 inhibitor
z-LEHD-fmk significantly abrogated adeno-XAF1–
induced apoptosis, and caspase 3 inhibitor z-DEVD-fmk
and a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk
exhibited stronger inhibition of apoptosis induced by
adeno-XAF1, whereas caspase 8 inhibitor z-IETD-fmk
slightly affected adeno-XAF1–induced apoptosis (data
not shown), indicating that XAF1 triggers apoptosis
mainly through intrinsic apoptotic pathway in a caspasedependent manner. Furthermore, apoptosis was significantly increased in cells treated with a combination of
adeno-XAF1 and TRAIL relative to those treated with

the combination of adeno-XAF1 and TRAIL markedly

tumors (100-150 mm3) were injected with adenoviruses (LacZ or XAF1) alone or in combination with TRAIL. Tumors were excised
at 3 days after treatment, and sections were subjected to terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling
(TUNEL) staining to reveal apoptotic cells. Green cells were apoptotic cells. The number of apoptotic cells was assessed in 10 randomly selected fields of each slide viewed at 40 magnification. The apoptotic index was calculated as the number of apoptotic

These data suggest that transient expression of XAF1 is
sufficient to suppress tumorigenesis.
Adeno-XAF1 Induces Tumor Regression in
Combination With TRAIL Treatment In Vivo
We finally investigated the therapeutic potential of
adeno-XAF1 alone or in combination with TRAIL on
established tumors. Mice bearing SW1116 xenograft were
randomly assigned to experimental groups. Single intratumor administration of adeno-XAF1 inhibited tumor
growth by approximately 71% at Day 28 postinjection,
whereas treatment with 2  2 lg TRAIL alone reduced

1260

tumor growth by 39% (Fig. 5A). Remarkably, complete
regression of pre-established tumors occurred in 9 of 12
mice that were treated with the combination of adenoXAF1 and TRAIL. In contrast, intratumoral administration of adeno-LacZ had little effect on tumor growth after
injection, and cotreatment with TRAIL did not increase
the antitumor effect of TRAIL. Similar results were
obtained in the Colo 205 xenograft model (data shown),
in which intratumoral administration of adeno-XAF1
alone inhibited tumor growth by approximately 73.3% at
Day 28 postinjection compared with the control virus
group. These results demonstrated that intratumoral
administration of adeno-XAF1 can significantly inhibit

Figure 6. The combination of adeno-XIAP-associated factor 1
(XAF1) and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing
ligand (TRAIL) treatment prolongs the survival time of mice.
SW1116 cells were injected into the left flank, and tumors
were allowed to progress to approximately 100 to 150 mm3
in volume. Tumors were injected with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), TRAIL (2  2 lg), adeno-LacZ, or adeno-XAF1 in 3
sites (5  108 plaque-forming units/site). Combination treatment using TRAIL and adeno-LacZ or adeno-XAF1 was also
performed. Animals were monitored daily, and tumor volume
was measured every week after treatment. Mortality was
determined either by natural death because of tumor burden
or by sacrificing of animals because of tumor size >2.5 cm3.

colon cancer growth, and acts synergistically with the antitumor activity of TRAIL.
We further assessed whether tumor suppression was
attributable to apoptosis induced by adeno-XAF1.
Tumors were harvested 3 days after local injection of
adeno-XAF1, adeno-LacZ, and/or TRAIL and analyzed
histologically. Tumors injected with adeno-XAF1 or
TRAIL displayed a significant increase in the number of
apoptotic cells as determined by TUNEL staining (Fig.
5B). Tumors injected with the combination of adenoXAF1 and TRAIL exhibited the greatest number of apoptotic cells. In contrast, tumors injected with adeno-LacZ
exhibited relatively few TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 5B).
These results confirm that the combination of adenoXAF1 and TRAIL synergizes the induction of apoptosis
in vivo, contributing to the regression of tumors.
Combined Adeno-XAF1 and TRAIL Therapy
Prolongs the Survival of Mice
To investigate the long-term antitumor effect of
XAF1, we assessed the survival of mice. We found
that mice challenged with SW1116 cells died from tumor burden effects or were sacrificed because of tumor
size >2.5 cm when treated with vehicle buffer or
adeno-LacZ alone (Fig. 6) (mean survival: PBS,
42  2.86 days; adeno-LacZ, 47  5.25 days). Mice
treated with TRAIL or adeno-XAF1 alone survived

significantly longer than buffer-treated mice, but all
eventually developed tumors (mean survival: TRAIL:
58  5.42 days [P < .01] and adeno-XAF1: 64  3.27
days [P < .01], compared with PBS group). Notably,
only mice treated with the combination of adenoXAF1 and TRAIL (12 of 12 mice) survived for the
full 96-day observation period after treatment (Fig. 6)
(P < .01, compared with adeno-XAF1 and TRAIL
alone). Although further studies are required to fully
assess the effect of the combined treatment using
adeno-XAF1 and TRAIL (or chemotherapeutic drugs)
on long-term survival, our findings indicate that the
combination of adeno-XAF1 and TRAIL prolongs the
survival of mice.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we provide evidence that overexpression of
XAF1 increases the apoptotic sensitivity of tumor cells to
various drugs, including TRAIL. Furthermore, adenovirus-mediated XAF1 expression directly induced apoptosis
in vitro and in vivo, and suppressed tumorigenicity in
vivo. The combination of adeno-XAF1 and TRAIL significantly inhibited tumor growth, resulted in tumor regression, and prolonged the survival of mice bearing tumor
xenografts. Our results demonstrate that the combination
of XAF1 and TRAIL treatment provides a synergistic antitumor growth effect in vivo.
XAF1 was identified as a XIAP-antagonist protein
that could inactivate the anticaspase function of XIAP.8
Recent studies have shown that XAF1 can directly degrade
the XIAP protein in trophoblast cells,29 and that XAF1
may also mediate survivin down-regulation through a
complex containing XIAP,30 confirming that XAF1
antagonizes the function of IAP antiapoptosis. In this
study, we demonstrated that the transduction of adenoXAF1 activates caspase 3 and caspase 9 and down-regulates the expression of XIAP in colon cancer cells. However, some studies have shown that overexpression of
XAF1 could sensitize XIAP-knockout colon cancer cells
(HCT116 XIAP/)13 and XIAP-knockout mouse
fibroblasts to drug-induced apoptosis,31 indicating that
XAF1 may induce apoptosis in XIAP-independent pathways. We recently reported that XAF1 mediates apoptosis
of cancer cells through an extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway.32 Thus, XAF1 induces apoptosis through
multiple mechanisms.
TRAIL is under investigation as a potential cancer
therapy because of its preferential killing of tumor cells

relative to normal cells.18-20 Levels of IAP family members influence sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.18
In prostate cancer cell lines displaying resistance, TRAIL
treatment results in mitochondrial release of both cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO, but this appears to be
insufficient to trigger apoptosis.33 Supplementing with
exogenous Smac or Smac agonists sensitizes for TRAILor anticancer drug-induced apoptosis and induces
regression of malignant tumors in vivo.34 A recent
report has also shown that the knockdown of XIAP by
a specific inhibitor or small interfering RNA synergizes
TRAIL-induced caspases activation and mitochondrial
perturbations, and augments antitumor effects in vivo.35
In addition, XAF1 enhanced Fas- and TNF-a–induced
degradation of XIAP and cell apoptosis in trophoblast
cells.30 In this study, we found that stable or transient
expression of XAF1 significantly potentiated TRAILinduced apoptosis and resulted in activation of caspase
3, 8, 7, and 9; release of cytochrome c; and degradation
of XIAP, survivin, and c-IAP-2. Thus, the combination
of XAF1 and TRAIL treatment amplifies the induction
of apoptosis by activation of intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways and inhibition of IAPs.28,36
In the current study, we further investigated the in
vivo effect of a combination of adeno-XAF1 and TRAIL
treatment on colon cancer growth. Although several studies have shown that XAF1 can sensitize cancer cells to apoptosis induced by TRAIL, TNF-a, Fas, and interferon-b
in vitro,21,22,29,31,37 to the best of our knowledge there are
no reports regarding the in vivo effect of XAF1 combined
with these factors on colon cancer growth. For what to
our knowledge is the first time, we demonstrate that the
combined treatment with adeno-XAF1 and TRAIL significantly increases the induction of apoptosis in colon
cancer xenograft tissues, resulting in a complete eradication of established colon cancer xenograft. Our result is
consistent with a recent report that the inhibition of XIAP
plus TRAIL treatment suppresses pancreatic cancer
growth and causes the regression of established pancreatic
cancer.35 Furthermore, we demonstrated that the combination of adeno-XAF1 with TRAIL significantly prolonged survival time of animals bearing tumor xenografts.
Thus, our current data provide direct evidence that the
combination of restoration of XAF1 expression with
TRAIL may be a potent strategy for colon cancer therapy.
It has been reported that a mitochondrial block and
expression of XIAP lead to resistance to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis during progression to metastasis of a colon carcinoma.37 The TRAIL-resistance of colon cancer SW620

1262

cells could be explained by high levels of XIAP, and by the
finding that down-regulation of XIAP is sufficient to
restore the sensitivity of SW620 cells to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis in the absence of Smac/Diablo or cytochrome c
release from the mitochondria.38 Another study has indicated that reduction of TRAIL-induced c-IAP2 by c-myc
and sorafenib may sensitize resistant human cancer cells to
TRAIL-induced death.39 Thus, combination of targeted
down-regulation of IAP family and activation of a mitochondrial pathway will facilitate overcoming TRAIL-resistance in human cancer cells. Given that XAF1 may
directly activate mitochondrial pathways and degrade
IAPs, the combination of XAF1 and TRAIL treatment
may also be a potential strategy for TRAIL-resistant
human cancer treatment. The therapeutic effect of combined adeno-XAF1 and TRAIL on TRAIL-resistant and
multiple drug-resistant colon cancer is currently under
investigation.
