Abstract
EC131, a new folate receptor (FR)–targeted drug conjugate,
was prepared by covalently attaching the vitamin folic acid
(FA) to a potent microtubule-inhibiting agent, maytansinoid
DM1, via an intramolecular disulfide bond. When tested on
cells in culture, EC131 was found to retain high affinity for FRpositive cells and to provide FR-specific cytotoxicity with an
IC50 in the low nanomolar range. The activity of EC131 was
completely blocked in the presence of an excess of free FA, and
no activity was detected against FR-negative cells. When
evaluated against s.c. FR-positive M109 tumors in BALB/c
mice, EC131 showed marked antitumor efficacy. Furthermore,
this therapeutic effect occurred in the apparent absence of
weight loss or noticeable organ tissue degeneration. In
contrast, no significant antitumor activity was observed in
EC131-treated animals that were codosed with an excess of FA,
thus demonstrating the targeted specificity of the in vivo
activity. EC131 also showed marked antitumor activity against
FR-positive human KB tumors, but not against FR-negative
A549 tumors, in nude mice with no evidence of systemic
toxicity during or after the therapy. In contrast, therapy with
the free maytansinoid drug (in the form of DM1-S-Me) proved
not to be effective against the KB model when administered at
its maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Taken together, these
results indicate that EC131 is a highly potent agent capable of
producing therapeutic benefit in murine tumor models at subMTD levels. [Cancer Res 2007;67(13):6376–82]

Introduction
Although considerable progress has been made in the development of anticancer therapies, cancer still remains a major cause of
death in the United States. One of the challenging aspects of
treating cancer has been the limitation on dosing of conventional
chemotherapeutic agents because of their toxic side effects and, in
particular, their toxicity toward actively proliferating nonmalignant
cells.
The development of techniques to selectively target drug
molecules to the tumor sites has allowed for enhancing the
selectivity of anticancer drugs and simultaneously reducing
unwanted systemic toxicity. This approach of targeting potent
antiproliferative agents to the tumor by conjugating cytotoxic

drugs, such as doxorubicin (1, 2), maytansinoid DM1 (3–5), and CC1065 analogue DC1 (6), to antibodies with affinity to a tumorassociated antigen has shown impressive preclinical antitumor
activities; further, it has been validated by the recent approval of
Mylotarg, an anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody (mAb)–calicheamicin
conjugate, for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (7, 8). In
principle, due to their larger molecular size, mAb-drug conjugates
may have lower tumor penetration ability than that of a lowmolecular-weight drug (9). Thus, we wished to test whether a lowmolecular weight, high-affinity receptor targeting ligand linked to a
potent cytotoxic drug would translate into high antitumor activity
in animal models.
One example of a small-molecule targeting ligand system is that
which uses folic acid (FA; or folate) to deliver chemically linked
therapeutic or imaging agents to cells that express the FA receptor
(FR; refs. 10–13). FA has high affinity (K d f0.1–1 nmol/L) for the
FR, which is a protein expressed in high quantities by many
primary and metastatic cancers (14–16) such as those originating
in ovary, lung, breast, endometrium, kidney, and brain but not on
most normal cells (17). FA has been used for the delivery of a wide
range of drugs, and promising preclinical activity has recently been
shown (10, 11, 13, 18–29). Because FA-linked molecules are
efficiently bound to FRs and internalized by receptor-mediated
endocytosis, we have explored the ability of FA to target the highly
potent antitubulin agent, DM1, which is a derivative of the natural
product, maytansine.
Maytansine, first isolated from Maytenus ovatus (30), is a wellinvestigated agent possessing very potent inhibitory action against
the growth of cancer cells (31). Maytansine has been shown to
inhibit the binding of the Vinca alkaloids to tubulin (32), and it acts
as a mitotic inhibitor by interfering with the formation of
microtubules (33). Although maytansine itself has not shown
significant benefit in clinical trials as a cancer treatment (34), this
compound still attracts considerable attention from many investigators, especially for its use as a conjugate with tumor-specific
antibodies. Here, we report on our synthesis and preclinical
investigation of EC131, a maytansinoid drug (DM1) linked to the
small tumor-targeting ligand, FA.

Experimental Procedures
Materials. Pteroic acid (Pte) and N 10-trifluoroacetylpteroic acid were
prepared according to Xu et al. (35). Peptide synthesis reagents were purchased from NovaBiochem and Bachem. DM1 and DM1-S-Me were prepared
from the microbial fermentation product Ansamitocin P-3 following literature procedures (36, 37). All other chemicals were of reagent grade and
were obtained from major suppliers.
Synthesis, purification, and analytic characterization of EC131.
EC131 was synthesized by constructing the FA and maytansinoid sections
separately followed by a one-step conjugation. Synthesis of the FA-containing

peptide spacer, EC893 (Pte-gGlu-Asp-Arg-Asp-Cys; see Fig. 1, 2), was done
by using a preloaded Fmoc-Cys (Mmt) 2-chlorotrityl resin and standard solidphase techniques. EC89 was purified on a preparative reversed-phase highperformance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) system connected to a
Novapak HR C18 19  300 mm column. A gradient method was used, starting
with 99% mobile phase A [10 mmol/L ammonium acetate buffer (pH 5.5)] and
1% mobile phase B (acetonitrile) and reaching 50% B within
30 min at a flow rate of 15 mL/min. Fractions corresponding to the main
peak (UV monitoring at 280 nm) were combined, and the acetonitrile was
removed under reduced pressure. The remaining solution was subjected to
freeze drying for 48 h to give EC89 at >90% purity based on analytic RP-HPLC
(room temperature 10 min) on NovaPak C18 3.9  150 mm column and
using a gradient of solvents starting with 99% mobile phase A
[10 mmol/L ammonium acetate buffer (pH 5.5)], 1% mobile phase B
(acetonitrile), and reaching 50% B within 30 min at a flow rate of
1.0 mL/min. Electrospray-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis of EC89
identified the correct molecular ion (M + H)+ = 931. Next, 100 mg of EC89 were
dissolved in 4 mL of water and triturated with argon for 10 min. In a separate
flask, a 0.1 N NaHCO 3 solution was triturated with argon for
10 min. The pH of the EC89 solution was carefully adjusted to 6.9 using this
0.1 N NaHCO3 solution. The dipyridyldisulfide reagent (30 mg, 1.25 equivalent)
dissolved in 2 mL of acetonitrile was added slowly to the above solution. The
resulting clear solution was stirred under argon for 15 min to 1 h. Progress of
the reaction was monitored by analytic RP-HPLC [0.1% trifluoroacetic acid

(TFA) in water (pH 2.0) and acetonitrile]. The acetonitrile was removed under
reduced pressure and the aqueous solution was filtered and injected on a
preparative RP-HPLC column (Waters X-terra C18 300  19 mm). Elution with
0.1% TFA in water (pH 2.0) and acetonitrile resulted in pure fractions
containing the product. Pure fractions were pooled, acetonitrile was removed
under reduced pressure at ambient temperature, and the sample was freezedried for 48 h (70 mg, 63% yield, HPLC purity >90%). ESI-MS analysis of 1
correctly identified the molecular ion (M + H)+ = 1041.
Ansamitocin P-3 was converted to the thiol-containing maytansinoid
DM1, and the methyldithio-maytansinoid DM1-S-Me, as described previously (36, 37). DM1-S-Me, which is a stable form of DM1, was used as the
free drug in efficacy studies in mice. DM1 was reacted with 1 to yield EC131
as follows: A solution of the pyridyldithio-activated EC89 1 (6.5 mg, 6.26
mmol) in a 1:1 mixture of DMF (0.175 mL) and potassium phosphate buffer
[50 mmol/L (pH 7.5), 0.175 mL] was stirred at room temperature. To this
solution was added aqueous sodium bicarbonate (177 mmol/L, 30.5 mmol)
with stirring. After stirring for 5 min, DM1 (5 mg, 6.1 mmol) dissolved in
DMF (0.195 mL) was added. RP-HPLC analysis of the crude reaction
confirmed that the reaction was complete after 30 min. The reaction was
quenched with acetic acid (0.075 mL) to give a total volume of 0.750 mL. The
solution was purified on RP-HPLC using a Vydac C18 column, eluting with a
gradient of acetonitrile and water containing 0.02% formic acid. Fractions
containing product were combined and concentrated under vacuum to give
4.24 mg of the desired product. Calculated m/z for C71H92ClN17O24S2 is

Cell culture. Cells were grown continuously as a monolayer using FAfree RPMI medium (FFRPMI) containing 10% heat-inactivated FCS (HIFCS)
at 37jC in a 5% CO2/95% air-humidified atmosphere with no antibiotics. HIFCS contains endogenous FAs at concentrations sufficient for

FR-expressing cells to survive and proliferate in this medium (18), which
consequently is more physiologically relevant than typical cell culture
medium that contains 100- to 1,000-fold higher levels of FAs. All cell culture
experiments were done using FFRPMI containing 10% HIFCS (FFRPMI/
HIFCS) as the growth medium.
Relative affinity assay. The relative affinity of EC131 was determined
according to the method described by Westerhoff et al. (38) with slight
modification. Briefly, FR-positive KB cells were seeded in 24-well Falcon
plates and allowed to form adherent monolayers (>90% confluent) overnight
in FFRPMI/HIFCS. Spent incubation medium was replaced with FFRPMI
supplemented with 10% HIFCS and containing 100 nmol/L of [3H]FA in the
absence and presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled FA or
EC131. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37jC and then rinsed thrice with
0.5 mL PBS. Five hundred microliters of 1% SDS in PBS were added to each
well; after 5 min, cell lysates were collected, transferred to individual vials
containing 5 mL of scintillation cocktail, and then counted for radioactivity.
Cells exposed to only the [3H]FA in FFRPMI (no competitor) were designated
as negative controls, whereas cells exposed to the [3H]FA plus 1 mmol/L
unlabeled FA served as positive controls. Disintegrations per minute (DPM)
measured in the latter samples (representing nonspecific binding of label;
826 DPM) were subtracted from the DPM values from all samples. Notably,
relative affinities were defined as the inverse molar ratio of compound
required to displace 50% of [3H]FA bound to FR on KB cells, and the relative
affinity of FA for the FR was set to 1.
Dose-dependent FR-specific activity of EC131. FR-positive KB (human
nasopharyngeal carcinoma), ID8 Clone-15 (stable FR transfected murine
ovarian cancer), New Line-01 (mouse lung cancer) and M109 (murine lung
adenocarcinoma) or FR-negative 4T1 (mouse breast cancer), CHO (Chinese
hamster ovarian cancer), 24JK (mouse sarcoma), and A549 (human lung
carcinoma) cells were seeded in 12-well Falcon plates and allowed to form
nearly confluent monolayers overnight in FFRPMI/HIFCS. Thirty minutes
before the addition of EC131, spent medium was aspirated from all wells
and replaced with either fresh FFRPMI or FFRPMI supplemented with
100 Amol/L FA. At this concentration, free FA completely blocked the
binding of EC131 to FR on the cell surface, thus revealing the extent of
nontargeted FR-independent cytotoxicity of EC131. Each well then received
1 mL of medium containing increasing concentrations of EC131 ( four wells
per sample). Cells were pulsed for 1 h at 37jC, rinsed four times with 0.5 mL
of medium, and then chased in 1 mL of fresh medium up to 72 h. Spent
medium was aspirated from all wells and replaced with fresh medium
containing 5 ACi/mL of [3H]thymidine. Following a 2 h incubation at 37jC,
cells were washed thrice with 0.5 mL of PBS and then treated with 0.5 mL of

ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid per well. After 15 min, the trichloroacetic
acid was aspirated and the cells were solubilized by the addition of 0.5 mL
of 0.25 N sodium hydroxide for 15 min at room temperature. Four hundred
and fifty microliters of each solubilized sample were transferred to
scintillation vials containing 3 mL of Ecolume scintillation cocktail and
counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Final results were expressed as the
percentage of [3H]thymidine incorporation (39) relative to untreated
controls.
Tumor models and therapy. Six- to eight-week-old female BALB/c mice
(Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Inc.) or female nu/nu mice (Charles River) were
maintained on a standard 12 h light-dark cycle for the duration of the
experiment. Because normal rodent chow contains a high concentration of
FA (6 mg/kg chow), mice used in these studies were fed a FA-free diet
(Harlan diet TD00434, Harlan Teklad) beginning 2 weeks before tumor
implantation and maintained throughout the experiment to achieve serum
FA concentrations closer to the range of normal human serum (40).
Syngeneic, FR-positive M109 tumor cells (1  106 per BALB/c mouse) or FRpositive KB cells (1  106 per nu/nu mouse) or FR-negative A549 tumor
cells (1  106 per nu/nu mouse) in 100 AL of FFRPMI containing 1% BALB/c
serum were injected in the subcutis of the dorsal medial area. Tumors were
measured in two perpendicular directions every 2 to 3 days using a caliper
and their volumes were calculated as 0.5  L  W 2, where L is the
measurement of longest axis in millimeters and W is the measurement of
axis perpendicular to L in millimeters. Data were analyzed using one-way
ANOVA by comparing the dose groups at each time point. Differences
between groups were considered statistically significant at P V 0.05. Log cell

kill (LCK) and treated over control (T/C) values were then calculated
according to published procedures (41, 42).
Dosing solutions were prepared fresh each day in PBS and administered
through the lateral tail vein of the mice. Importantly, dosing was initiated
when the s.c. tumors were between 50 and 100 mm3 in volume. Drug toxicity
was assessed by collecting blood via cardiac puncture and submitting the sera
for independent analysis of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and the liver
enzymes aspartate aminotransferase (AST-SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT-SGPT) at Ani-Lytics, Inc. In addition, histopathologic evaluation
of formalin-fixed heart, lungs, liver, spleen, kidney, intestine, skeletal muscle,
and bone (tibia/fibula) were done at Animal Reference Pathology Laboratories (ARUP, Salt Lake City, UT).

Results
Synthesis of EC131. The design and regioselective synthesis of
the DM1 conjugate, EC131, is outlined in Fig. 1. As indicated in the
retrosynthetic analysis, EC131 was assembled by tethering the FApeptide unit, EC89, 2, to the maytansinoid DM1, via a reducible
disulfide bond.
Relative affinity assay. The binding affinity of EC131, relative to
FA, was evaluated using an in vitro competition assay. As shown in
Fig. 2, the affinity of EC131 toward the FR was determined to be
f2.7-fold lower than that of FA (0.37 relative to FA). Thus, linkage
of a large maytansinoid molecule does not radically alter the
vitamin’s intrinsic binding affinity to its receptor.
In vitro cytotoxicity and specificity. The cytotoxicity of EC131
was evaluated against a panel of FR-positive (>6 pmol FR/mg
protein, as defined in ref. 17) and FR-negative (<2.5 pmol FR/mg
protein) cells in vitro. As shown in Fig. 3A, EC131 was determined to
be highly cytotoxic toward KB cells, with an IC50 value of 16 nmol/L.
This activity was completely blocked by excess FA, thereby
demonstrating that the cytotoxic effect was FR mediated. The
activity of EC131 was also determined to be concentration
dependent against FR-positive ID8 Clone-15, New Line-01, and
M109 cells with IC50 values <25 nmol/L (Table 1). This activity was
again effectively blocked in the presence of excess free FA. In
addition, EC131 was not found to be cytotoxic toward FR-negative
4T1 (Fig. 3B), CHO, 24JK, or A549 cells (see Table 1) within the range
of concentrations tested, which further substantiates the selective
action of the drug toward FR-positive cells.
FR-specific in vivo potency of EC131. The antitumor activity of
EC131 was examined against BALB/c mice bearing the s.c. FR-

positive syngeneic lung adenocarcinoma, M109, which incidentally
express similar numbers of receptors as many human ovarian
carcinomas (17). The activity of EC131 was first assessed by
administering the drug i.v. 11 days post tumor implantation (PTI)
using a 1 Amol/kg dose level and following a twice weekly, 4-weeklong treatment schedule. As shown in Fig. 4A, tumors in the
untreated animals reached f1,500 mm3 by approximately day 42,
whereas the tumor growth in animals treated with EC131 was
markedly delayed (on the average, by f45 days). Out of five
animals treated with EC131, one mouse experienced a complete
response (CR), three mice had partial responses (PR) with a
collective LCK of 1.2 and 181% T/C, and one of the five mice did
not respond. The EC131 group differed significantly from that of
the untreated group at days 18 PTI and beyond. Importantly, at
this dose of EC131, the animals experienced no noticeable toxicity
(see below). The antitumor activity of EC131 was essentially
eliminated when this agent was coadministered together with a
10-fold molar excess of unmodified FA (i.e., no CR or PR among
five animals; an average tumor growth delay of only 1 day; see
Fig. 4A) with statistically significant differences being achieved
between the two groups at day 25 PTI and beyond. This outcome
indicated that the antitumor activity of EC131 was dependent on
its binding to tumor-associated FR. Free drug (as DM1-S-Me) was
administered to mice at its maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
1 Amol/kg twice a week. This treatment resulted in only a modest
8-day average delay of tumor growth (Fig. 4A) producing one CR,
whereas the other four animals did not respond to the treatment.
Overall, the antitumor effects in the EC131 group differed
significantly from that of the DM1-S-Me–treated group at days
32 PTI and beyond.
A second study was done in nu/nu mice bearing a s.c. xenograft
of FR-positive human KB tumor. Animals were treated i.v. with
1.5 Amol/kg of EC131 given thrice a week for a total of 3 weeks
starting 11 days PTI. In this model, EC131 was also found to produce
marked antitumor activity, delaying the tumor growth by at least
55 days (Fig. 5A) with four CRs and one PR (0.9 LCK and 156% T/C).
Again, not one of the EC131-treated animals showed any signs of
toxicity during and after the therapy. In contrast to EC131, DM1S-Me dosed at its MTD (0.12 Amol/kg, daily  5, 1 week schedule)
did not produce any meaningful antitumor activity in this xenograft
model (0 CR and PR; collective LCK of 0.3 and 119% T/C; see
Fig. 5B). Thus, for a second time, the antitumor effect in the EC131

Motor activity and feeding behavior of all EC131-treated mice
were completely normal throughout the duration of the study. As
shown in Figs. 4B and 5B, the body weights of the mice treated
with EC131 remained stable throughout the experiments. In
contrast, BALB/c mice treated with untargeted DM1-S-Me had
lost 5% to 10% weight after receiving only three doses.
Serum samples were analyzed for changes in clinical chemistry
markers. The amounts of ALT, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and
total protein were found to be within normal levels in all of the
EC131-treated BALB/c and nu/nu mice. The liver enzyme AST was
modestly elevated (e1.7-fold of the upper reference limit) in
EC131-treated BALB/c mice. The corresponding DM1-S-Me–
treated mice displayed up to 2-fold elevation of aspartate
aminotransferase.
Histopathologic evaluation of the liver, spleen, intestine, bone,
and kidneys of both BALB/c and nu/nu mice treated with EC131
were all normal. Mild degeneration was observed in the livers of the
DM1-S-Me–treated mice. Taken together, the morbidity, mortality,
serum markers, and pathologic observations showed that the EC131
therapy was well tolerated at therapeutically effective dose levels.

group differed significantly from that of the untreated group and
the DM1-S-Me–treated groups at days 18 PTI and beyond.
An additional control study was done where nu/nu mice were
inoculated with s.c. FR-negative A549 human cancer cells and then
subsequently treated with i.v. EC131 injections 15 days after tumor
cell inoculation using either a 1 Amol/kg, BIW  4 week regimen
(similar to M109 tumor study; Fig. 4), or a 1.5 Amol/kg, TIW  3
week regimen (similar to KB tumor study; Fig. 5). In either case,
EC131 did not produce any significant antitumor effect (Fig. 6A).
Thus, together with the M109 and KB model data, these data
confirm that the in vivo activity of EC131 is potent and specific for
FR-expressing tumors.
Treatment-related adverse events. To evaluate the systemic
toxicity of the EC131 and DM1-S-Me therapies, the tumor-bearing
BALB/c and nu/nu mice were monitored during and after the
time of treatment for changes in motor and feeding behavior,
body weight, serum markers, and histopathology of important
tissues.

Folate Receptor–Specific Antitumor Activity of EC131

Figure 6. Effect of EC131 on the growth of s.c. FR-negative A549 tumors (A )
and on weight of the treated nu/nu mice (B). A549 tumor cells (1  106)
were implanted s.c. into nu/nu mice, and 15 d later, mice were randomized
and treated with EC131. n, untreated mice; E, EC131-treated group at
1 Amol/kg/injection) on a twice a week schedule for 4 wks; ., EC131-treated
group at 1.5 Amol/kg/injection following a thrice per week, 3 wks schedule
(statistical comparison with controls). Points, average tumor volume from five
animals. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA (*, P < 0.05).

Discussion
EC131 is a novel conjugate of FA with the potent maytansinoid
DM1 drug linked together with a disulfide bond. It has been
recently shown (43, 44) that linkers of this type are stable in the
circulation for a prolonged period of time, but are cleaved inside
the cell, releasing a free cytotoxic derivative of maytansinoid.
Notably, intracellular release of disulfide-linked drugs from a FA
conjugate was recently shown by real-time imaging using a
fluorescence resonance energy transfer technique (45).
A previously reported FA-maytansinoid conjugate (25), although
found to be potent in vitro, was never tested in vivo due to poor
water solubility. To circumvent this issue, we used an improved,
highly water soluble peptide spacer for construction of EC131.

Importantly, FA-drug conjugates constructed with comparable
hydrophilic spacers were recently found to be active against
FR-expressing tumors (26–29, 46). Similarly, EC131 was found to
produce a marked antitumor effect, selectively eradicating
FR-expressing tumors in multiple mouse models.
The majority of normal tissues in the body express low to
nondetectable levels of the FR (17). However, the proximal
tubules of the kidney do express a substantial amount of this
protein (14, 47, 48). The FR is restricted to the apical membrane
of these polarized epithelial cells (i.e., facing the lumen of the
tubule), and these sites are accessible to i.v. administered FA
conjugates (14, 47, 49, 50). Overall, the function of kidney FRs
seems to be to capture FAs, or drug conjugates thereof, in
the urinary filtrate and to transcytose them back into the blood
(47, 48, 51). Supporting this hypothesis are the observations that
(a) analyses of blood from animals after i.v. therapy with FA-drug
conjugates such as the FA-maytansinoid conjugate described
above, FA-mitomycin C, and FA-Vinca alkaloids, have not
detected any abnormalities in blood urea nitrogen or creatinine
levels, and (b) pathologic analyses of kidneys from treated animals
have not reported any apparent organ degeneration (26, 27).
However, more thorough toxicologic studies are needed to affirm
this premise.
A sizable number of antibody-drug conjugates are in
preclinical and clinical evaluation. In such conjugates, the linked
cytotoxic drug acquires the pharmacokinetic properties of the
antibody component, such as a long serum half-life. With the use
of small targeting molecules, such as FA, the cytotoxic drug
maintains more of its drug-like pharmacokinetic characteristics,
which may facilitate more extensive drug delivery to the tumor
and, consequently, greater tumor cell kill. Because EC131 has
been constructed with a highly hydrophilic peptide spacer, the
increased water solubility could possibly allow for rapid
penetration through interstitial spaces. Indeed, other hydrophilic
FA-drug conjugates have shown the ability to rapidly saturate
tumor-bound FRs, and to simultaneously clear from the blood
stream (serum half lives are typically <5 min; refs. 49, 50). Such
target-tissue–specific retention, with concomitant rapid clearance
from circulation, may be viewed as favorable attributes to the
FA-targeted therapeutic approach.
Considering that (a) a substantial number of tumor types have
been reported to express the FR (14–16), and (b) the preclinical data
from this study that show that DM1 can be effectively targeted to
FR-positive tumors without significant toxicity, it is possible that
EC131 could provide clinical benefit to FR-positive cancer patients.
