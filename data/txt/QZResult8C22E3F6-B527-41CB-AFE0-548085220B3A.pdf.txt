Abstract
The spliceosome is a large ribonucleoprotein complex that guides pre-mRNA splicing in eukaryotic cells. Here,
we determine whether the spliceosome could constitute an attractive therapeutic target in cancer. Analysis of
gene expression arrays from lung, breast, and ovarian cancers datasets revealed that several genes encoding
components of the core spliceosome composed of a heteroheptameric Sm complex were overexpressed in
malignant disease as compared with benign lesions and could also deﬁne a subset of highly aggressive breast
cancers. siRNA-mediated depletion of SmE (SNRPE) or SmD1 (SNRPD1) led to a marked reduction of cell viability
in breast, lung, and melanoma cancer cell lines, whereas it had little effect on the survival of the nonmalignant
MCF-10A breast epithelial cells. SNRPE or SNRPD1 depletion did not lead to apoptotic cell death but autophagy,
another form of cell death. Indeed, induction of autophagy was revealed by cytoplasmic accumulation of
autophagic vacuoles and by an increase in both LC3 (MAP1LC3A) protein conversion and the amount of acidic
autophagic vacuoles. Knockdown of SNRPE dramatically decreased mTOR mRNA and protein levels and was
accompanied by a deregulation of the mTOR pathway, which, in part, explains the SNRPE-dependent induction of
autophagy. These ﬁndings provide a rational to develop new therapeutic agents targeting spliceosome core
components in oncology. Cancer Res; 73(7); 2247–58. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Targeted therapies have been shown to improve outcome in
breast cancers. Molecular targeted agents usually inhibit key
oncogenic pathways involved in cancer progression or resistance to conventional treatments. Most of these new molecular
therapies target kinase pathways and are usually highly effective in a speciﬁc molecular segment. In the recent years,
accumulative evidence has been reported that beyond kinase
and DNA repair defects, many pathways are crucial for cancer
progression. For instance, metabolism, immune system, and
epigenetics have been reported as targetable in oncology.
Looking for novel pathways involved in cancer progression,
we previously identiﬁed spliceosome assembly components as

the most enriched pathway in breast cancer samples, when
compared with benign lesions (1).
The aim of the present study was to determine whether the
spliceosome could be a relevant therapeutic target in cancer.
The spliceosome is a dynamic macromolecular ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex that catalyses the splicing of nuclear premRNA (precursor mRNA) into mRNAs. Nuclear pre-mRNA
splicing is essential to remove internal noncoding regions of
pre-mRNA (introns) and to join the remaining segments (exons)
into mRNA before export to the cytoplasm and translation. The
spliceosome does the 2 primary functions of splicing, that is,
recognition of the intron/exon boundaries and catalysis of the
cut-and-paste reactions that remove introns and join exons. The
spliceosomal machinery complex is formed from 5 RNP subunits, termed uridine-rich (U-rich) small nuclear RNP (snRNP),
transiently associated to a range of protein factors (2, 3). Each
snRNP (U1, U2, U4/U6, and U5) consists of a uridine-rich small
nuclear RNA (snRNA) complexed with a set of 7 proteins known
as Sm or SNRP proteins. The Sm proteins (B/B', D1, D2, D3, E, F
and G) form a 7-member ring core structure that encompasses
RNA. All Sm proteins share a conserved Sm domain, consisting
of 2 sets of conserved sequences (Sm1 and Sm2) that are
responsible for the assembly of snRNAs in an ordered manner,
to form the Sm core of the spliceosomal snRNPs (4, 5) and are
thereby involved in pre-mRNA processing (6).
The splicing process has a crucial role in the control of the
expression of many genes (such as those involved in cell cycle,
signal transduction, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and invasion;

refs. 7–15). Mutations of splicing factors or alterations of the
expression of the components of the splicing machinery can
affect the splicing pattern of genes and contribute to the
development of tumors (16–19). Deregulated alternative splicing can lead to the production of novel mRNA isoforms coding
for protein variants with key functions in cancer
(7, 10, 13, 20, 21). A substantial fraction of alternative splicing
events in humans can also result in mRNA isoforms that harbor
a premature termination codon (PTC). These transcripts are
predicted to be degraded by the nonsense-mediated mRNA
decay (NMD) pathway which constitutes a mechanism of RNA
surveillance that detects and eliminates aberrantly spliced
mRNAs harboring a PTC to prevent the synthesis of nonfunctional or deleterious truncated proteins (22, 23) and to regulate
the abundance of mRNA transcripts (24).
In the present study, we have evaluated whether components of the spliceosome machinery complex were overexpressed in malignant tumors and whether blocking spliceosome could lead to antitumor effects.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and siRNA transfection
All cell lines were supplied by American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC, LGC Standards) between 2007 and 2011.
Each ATCC cell line was ﬁrst ampliﬁed to generate a cell master
bank. All experiments were carried out from this cell bank. All
the cell lines used were tested negative for mycoplasma
contamination using VenorGeM Advance PCR Kit (Biovalley).
Human mammary carcinoma cell lines SKBr-3 (ATCC HTB30), MDA-MB 468 (ATCC HTB-132), HCC1937 (ATCC CRL2336), lung carcinoma A549 (ATCC CCL-185), and malignant
melanoma A375 (ATCC CRL-1619) were cultured as monolayers at 37 C with 5% CO2 and maintained by regular passage
in complete media consisting of RPMI-1640 GlutaMaxI or
Dulbeccos' Modiﬁed Eagle's Media (DMEM):F12 (Gibco BRL,
Invitrogen Life Technology) supplemented with 10% heatinactivated FBS (PAN Biotech, Dutscher), 1 mmol/L sodium
pyruvate (Invitrogen), and 10 m mmol/L HEPES (Invitrogen).
MCF-7 (ATCC HTB-22) was maintained in completed DMEM/
F12–GlutaMaxI medium supplemented with 0.01 mg/mL insulin (Invitrogen). Nontumoral epithelial cell line MCF-10-2A
(ATCC CRL-10781) was maintained in DMEM/F12–GlutaMaxI
medium supplemented with 20 ng/mL EGF (Gibco, Invitrogen), 100 ng/mL cholera toxin (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.01 mg/mL
insulin (Invitrogen), 500 ng/mL hydrocortisone (SigmaAldrich), and 5% heat-inactivated horse serum (Invitrogen).
Forty-eight hours after plating, the cells were transfected with
speciﬁc SNRPE or D1 validated siRNA (see Supplementary
Table S1 for sequence information; Qiagen) or nontargeting
control siRNA (ON-TARGETplus Non-targeting Pool, Dharmacon) using HiPerfect transfection agent (Qiagen) according to
the manufacturer's instructions. Brieﬂy, cells were plated in 12well plates in 4 replicates and grown to approximately 50% to
60% conﬂuency. siRNA was diluted in OPTI-MEM minimal
culture medium (Invitrogen) at a ﬁnal concentration of 50
nmol/L and then Hiperfect was added to the diluted siRNA and
the mixture was dropwise added to each well in a ﬁnal volume

2248

of 1 mL. For controls, cells were either exposed to Hiperfect
reagent alone (mock) or transfected with a nontargeting
control siRNA. Transfection medium was replaced by fresh
culture medium every 48 hours until the end of experiment.
After 96 hours of transfection, cells were harvested, counted
using the trypan blue exclusion method or crystal violet
staining, and processed for the various biochemical assays.
siRNA transfection effect and siRNA concentration effect on
cell number were estimated by 2-way ANOVA.
For NMD inhibition experiments, cells were transfected with
SNRPE siRNA or nontargeting control siRNA. Three days later,
cells were treated for 8 hours with 100 mg/mL cycloheximide
(Sigma-Aldrich) or with an equivalent amount of dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) as a control. RNA was then isolated and
mRNA expression was detected by real-time PCR (RT-PCR).
Quantiﬁcations of the RT-PCR signals were calculated from
RT-PCR assays conducted on samples from 2 independent
transfections.
Immunoblot analysis
Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA)
buffer, and proteins were quantiﬁed using a microBCA assay
(Pierce, ThermoScientiﬁc). Equal amounts were separated on
SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene
ﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes followed by immunoblot with
antibodies speciﬁc for mTOR (Cell Signaling, Ozyme), 4E-BP1
(Cell Signaling), phospho-4E-BP1 (Ser 65; Cell Signaling), antiLC3B (Sigma-Aldrich), SNRPD1 (C-15) and SNRPE (L-17; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology). Immunolabeled proteins were detected
by a chemiluminescence detection system (Super Signal West
Dura Signal, Pierce, ThermoScientiﬁc). Membranes were then
washed in 0.1% TBS-Tween-20 and incubated with rabbit antiGAPDH or mouse anti-actin (C4; Chemicon, Millipore) to
quantify and normalize results.
Cell-cycle analysis
Cell-cycle distribution was measured in SKBr-3 cells transfected with 50 nmol/L SNRPE-speciﬁc validated siRNA or
nontargeting control siRNA. Cells were harvested at 72 hours
after transfection, suspended in PBS, and ﬁxed in 70% ethanol.
Then, DNA content was evaluated after propidium iodide
staining. Fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis was carried out using a FACScan ﬂow cytometer (Beckton Dickinson)
and CellQuest software.
Apoptosis detection
The PE Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Biosciences) was used to detect apoptosis by ﬂow cytometry. At
72 hours of siRNA transfection, cells were harvested, washed in
PBS, and pelleted by centrifugation. They were resuspended at
105 cells/100 mL in a binding buffer to which 5 mL of Annexin-V
and 5 mL of 7-aminoactinomycin D (AAD) were added and then
incubated in the dark for 15 minutes at room temperature.
Then, 400 mL of binding buffer was added and the cells were
immediately processed with a FACScan ﬂow cytometer. The
numbers show the percentages of cells in each quadrant

necrotic cells; top right: 7-AADþ/PEþ, late apoptotic or

served as positive control of apoptosis induction.
Autophagy analysis by transmission electron microscopy
SKBr-3 cells were transfected with SNRPE-speciﬁc validated
siRNA or nontargeting control siRNA as described above.
Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were ﬁxed with
1.6% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer (pH 7.4)
at room temperature for 1 hour. Samples were rinsed in the
same buffer then postﬁxed with osmium tetroxyde and 1.5%
potassium ferrocyanide in 0.1 mol/L cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4)
for 1 hour at room temperature. Cells were rinsed with distilled
water, dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol, and
embedded in epoxy resin. Embedded samples were then
conventionally processed for thin sectioning (70 nm), contrasted by uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and observed with
Zeiss 902 electron microscopy in ﬁltered zero loss mode using
CDD megaviewIII camera and SIS system (Olympus). Autophagic cells were counted on 60 cells series per sample. The
identiﬁcation of autophagy was based on the observation of
macro-autophagic vacuoles, that is, multiple membranes vesicles engulﬁng a portion of the cytoplasm.
Detection and quantiﬁcation of acidic vesicular
organelles with acridine orange staining using ﬂow
cytometry
To detect the presence of acidic vesicular organelles (AVO),
tumor cells staining with acridine orange (Sigma-Aldrich) was
conducted as described previously (25). Brieﬂy, 96 hours after
siRNA transfection, SKBr-3 cells were washed with PBS and
stained with 1 mg/mL acridine orange in serum-free medium
(Sigma Aldrich) for 20 minutes at 37 C. Acridine orange–
stained cells were trypsinized, washed, and analyzed with ﬂow
cytometer. Green (510–530 nm, FL1-H channel) and red (>650
nm, FL3-H channel) ﬂuorescence emissions from 104 cells
illuminated with blue (488 nm) excitation light are measured
with a FACScanto from BD Biosciences using DIVA software.
Autophagy was quantiﬁed as a ratio between geomean ﬂuorescence intensity of red versus green ﬂuorescence (FL3/FL1).
Treated cells with nutrient-free medium EBSS (Invitrogen) for
24 hours before the addition of acridine orange served as
positive controls.
Gene expression microarray
Transcriptome analysis following SNRPE depletion was
conducted using exon array (ExonHit Therapeutics). SKBr-3
cells were transfected with SNRPE-speciﬁc validated siRNA or
nontargeting control siRNA as previously described. Total RNA
was extracted using RNA isolation RNeasy micro Kit (Qiagen)
at 96 hours after transfection. The concentration of RNA was
measured using Nanodrop spectrophotometer. The quality of
RNA preparations was assessed using Lab-on-a-Chip Bioanalyser 2000 technology (Agilent Technologies). Aliquots of
extracted total RNA from the samples were sent to ExonHit
Therapeutics for array processing. ExonHit staff processed to a
human Genome-Wide SpliceArray microarray on the Affymetrix platform using single color labeling. Processing includ-

scanning, and data normalization
Reverse transcription and RT-quantitative PCR
Total RNA was extracted using RNA isolation RNeasy micro
Kit (Qiagen) at 96 hours after transfection. mTOR mRNA
expression was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR (RTqPCR) in SKBr-3 cells transfected by SNRPE or control siRNA.
One microgram of total RNA from each sample was reversetranscribed by superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen)
in the presence of random primers (Applied Biosystems, Life
technologies). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was carried out on an
equivalent amount of 12.5 ng total RNA per tube in a ﬁnal
volume of 25 mL. Oligonucleotide primers and TaqMan probes
were designed using the PrimerExpress computer software
(Applied Biosystems) and purchased from MWG Biotech. The
primers and probe sequences used for the qPCR for mTOR and
housekeeping genes are detailed in Supplementary Table S2.
The relative expression of mTOR mRNA was determined by
using the Ct value and the 2DDCt method. The data are
presented as the fold change in gene expression normalized
using housekeeping genes (TBBP, RPLPO).
Expression proﬁling of spliceosome-related genes
Two unpublished datasets of gene expression arrays were
used to determine a correlation between spliceosome expression and clinical characteristics as well as the proliferation
biomarker MKI67. These two studies used Agilent 44K platform. The ﬁrst study compared gene expression levels between
ovarian adenocarcinomas (n ¼ 21) and borderline (nonmalignant) lesions (n ¼ 21). The second one evaluated gene expression in 148 breast cancer samples including 27 triple-negative
breast cancer (TNBC). In this latter study, the reference for
gene expression was normal breast (pool of 3 samples). In
addition to these 2 studies, we used publically available gene
expression data available from Landi and colleagues (26) and
Andre and colleagues (1). Lung dataset from Landi and colleagues included 107 non–small cell lung carcinomas (n ¼ 58)
and nontumor tissues (n ¼ 49). Breast dataset from Andre and
colleagues included 165 samples (120 cancers and 45 benign
lesions) obtained by ﬁne-needle aspiration of breast lesion.
Spliceosome complex components (from Biocarta database)
were extracted from these datasets respectively. The log2 gene
expression was analyzed and when one gene is represented by
more than one probe set, the one with the highest variance was
used. To illustrate the gene expression distribution of the
spliceosome complex components, boxplot graphs depict this
information according to sample types.
Statistical analysis
Effects of siRNA transfections on cell lines proliferation were
estimated by 2-way ANOVA. The effects of transfection conditions were ﬁrst analyzed by considering all cell lines as a ﬁrst
factor and the transfection conditions as a second factor
(nontransfected cells, mock, unspeciﬁc siRNA). Here, and for
each cell line, counting values were initially transformed into
proportions of the maximum value in each corresponding cell
line and then linearized with a logit link. Next, the effects of the

2 speciﬁc siRNA transfections were analyzed independently.
For each cell line, both nonspeciﬁc and speciﬁc siRNA counting
values were initially transformed into proportions of the
corresponding mock counting value. After a logit transformation, cell lines and transfection (speciﬁc siRNA vs. nonspeciﬁc
siRNA) were considered as the 2 factors in a 2-way ANOVA.

Results
Genes involved in spliceosome machinery are
overexpressed in malignant disease and deﬁne
aggressive phenotypes
We evaluated the expression of 15 genes related to spliceosomal assembly, according to the BioCarta database, including
U1snRNP-speciﬁc protein (SNRNP70 or U1-70K), constitutive
splicing factors (U2AF1, U2AF2), splicing regulator (SFRS2), and
core spliceosomal components (SNRP-A/A1, B/B2, C, D1/D2/
D3, E, F, and G). Differential gene expression analysis between
malignant and normal tissues was ﬁrst conducted on (i) a
microarray dataset from Landi and colleagues comparing gene
expression in 107 non–small cell lung carcinomas (n ¼ 58) and
nontumor tissues (n ¼ 49) and (ii) an unpublished microarray
dataset comparing 148 breast cancers and normal breast
samples. We found that genes related to spliceosome assembly
components are overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma (Fig.
1A) and breast cancer (Fig. 1B) as compared with nontumoral
tissue. Next, we used an unpublished ovary microarray dataset
to compare gene expression between 21 invasive ovarian
cancers and 21 borderline lesions. The borderline lesions are
deﬁned as a subset of epithelial ovarian tumors of low malignant potential representing an intermediate stage between
fully benign and fully malignant adenocarcinomas. Strikingly,
spliceosome assembly components are overexpressed in ovarian cancer as compared with borderline tumors (Fig. 1C),
suggesting that overexpression of spliceosomal machinery
components was related to malignancy. No major correlation
was found between the proliferation marker MKI67 and the
spliceosome-related genes in the 3 datasets described (Supplementary Fig. S1).
We ﬁnally assessed whether overexpression of spliceosome
assembly components deﬁnes a more aggressive disease. To do
this, we looked at the correlation between the expression of the
15 genes and clinical characteristics. For this analysis, we used
a public dataset of 120 breast cancer samples and 45 benign
breast lesions (1). Interestingly, unsupervised clustering
deﬁned 2 populations, one of which overexpressed the spliceosome assembly components (Fig. 2). This spliceosome positive
cluster was enriched in patients presenting with a TNBC (lack
expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and
HER2) and Her2-overexpressing breast cancer (47% of the
spliceosome-positive breast cancers). These ﬁndings suggested that overexpression of spliceosome assembly components were not only overexpressed in malignant diseases but
also could deﬁne a subset of highly aggressive cancers.
Knockdown of components of the spliceosome decreases
viability of cancer cells, but not of nonmalignant cells
To investigate the role of the spliceosome, we focused on the
core spliceosomal components SNRPE and SNRPD1 that were

2250

Cancer Res; 73(7) April 1, 2013

consistently found to be among the top differentially expressed
genes in the 3 series of samples. We ﬁrst used siRNA-mediated
depletion of SNRPE to knockdown SNRPE expression in the
SKBr-3 and MDA-MB 468 breast cancer cell lines that were
chosen because they are respectively HER2-ampliﬁed and
triple-negative. We also used the nontumoral MCF-10A breast
cell line to compare the effects of depleting a spliceosome
component in cancer cells with nontumoral cells. As revealed
by Western blot analysis, SNRPE protein level was efﬁciently
reduced by siRNA in the 3 cell lines (Fig. 3A). SNRPE knockdown induced a major decrease of cell viability as compared
with mock in the 2 tumor cell lines [MDA-MB 468 (88.6% vs.
102.1% in siControl cells) and SKBr-3 (58.1% vs. 104.9% in
siControl cells)], whereas it had a much weaker effect (24.2% vs.
95.1% in siControl cells) in the nontumoral MCF-10A cells
(Pinteraction ¼ 0.00022).
To ascertain that this effect is due to spliceosome targeting,
we knocked down the expression of another core spliceosomal
component. We chose SNRPD1, another upregulated core
spliceosomal protein in malignant tumors (Fig. 3B). Here again,
following SNRPD1 knockdown, we observed a major reduction
of cell viability in the 2 breast tumoral cell lines MDA-MB 468
(78.4%) and SKBr-3 (57.7%) and a weaker effect (24.1%) in the
nontumoral MCF-10A cells (Pinteraction ¼ 0.00224).
Of note expression of the genes encoding the other core
spliceosomal components (SNRP-A/A1, B2, C, D2/D3, F, and G)
was assessed by RT-qPCR in SNRPE- or SNRPD1- depleted
cells. No or only weak changes were observed in the expression
of these genes (Supplementary Fig. S2), showing that the
siRNAs used in this study and targeting SNRPE or SNRPD1
had no off-target effects on related components of the
spliceosome.
We next evaluate whether spliceosome depletion impacts on
cell proliferation of additional breast, melanoma, and lung
tumoral cell lines. A signiﬁcant decrease in cell viability was
observed in all tested tumoral cell lines following SNRPE and
SNRPD1 knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Altogether, these results revealed that all tumoral cell lines
were sensitive to spliceosome depletion, independently of their
proliferation rate (Supplementary Fig. S4). Moreover, a nontumoral breast cell line (MCF-10A) was less sensitive to spliceosome depletion than tumoral cell lines, suggesting that the
antiproliferative effect of spliceosome depletion was speciﬁc to
malignant cells.
SNRPE or SNRPD1 targeting mediates cancer cell death
through autophagy
To further investigate the cellular mechanism that led to a
decrease in cell viability, we assessed whether the spliceosome
regulated apoptosis or cell cycle. As revealed by ﬂuorescenceactivated cell-sorting (FACS) analysis, SNRPE knockdown
induced a marked increase in the sub-G1 population in
SNRPE-depleted cells (19.32%) as compared with control cells
(2.62%), indicative of cell death occurrence (Fig. 4A). Apoptotic
cell death was analyzed by using double cell labeling with
Annexin V-PE and 7-AAD. SNRPE depletion did not lead to a
signiﬁcant increase in the amount of Annexin V–positive cells
(31.44% as compared with 39.7% for control cells; Fig. 4B) and

therefore did not induce typical apoptosis. Similar effects were
obtained in SNRPD1-depletd cells (Supplementary Fig. S5).
We next analyzed autophagy, another form of cell death, by
using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) approach that
allowed detecting the presence of autophagic vacuoles in cell
cytoplasm. Autophagic features such as intracellular vacuolization and double-membrane structures referred as autophagosomes (early autophagic compartment) were observed in
SNRPE-depleted cells (Fig. 5A). The amount of cells containing
autophagosomes was 2-fold higher in SNRPE-depleted cells
(9%) than in control cells (4%) at 48 hours posttransfection.
The cytoplasmic accumulation of autophagosomes following
SNRPE depletion is consistent with an induction of the autophagic pathway.
We next evaluated the expression of the microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), commonly used as a
marker of the autophagic process that directly correlates with
the extent of autophagosome formation (27, 28). LC3 protein
exists in 2 forms: a cytosolic 18-kDa LC3-I and a 16-kDa LC3-II
that binds to autophagosomes membranes during autophagy.
SNRPE or SNRPD1 depletion led to an increase in the LC3-II
form that indicated an autophagosome formation and an
induction of autophagy (Fig. 5B).
To further reinforce the data concerning autophagy, we
evaluated the presence of late (autolysosome) markers of
autophagy using cell staining with acridine orange, a lysotropic
dye that accumulates in acidic organelles formed during
autophagy. The quantitative analysis of acridine orange–
stained cells showed that knockdown of SNRPE or SNRPD1
protein expression in SKBr-3 cells induced a signiﬁcant

increase of orange red ﬂuorescence as compared with control
cells, indicating formation of acidic autophagolysosomal
vacuoles following spliceosome depletion (Fig 5C).
Overall, these data indicated that targeting core spliceosomal component such as SNRPE or SNRPD1 could mediate
cancer cell death through autophagy.
SNRPE knockdown leads to mTOR downregulation
To identify the molecular mechanisms leading to autophagy,
we analyzed gene expression proﬁles in SNRPE-depleted SKBr3 cell line. Transcriptome analysis on exon microarrays
revealed that 51 genes were overexpressed and 41 genes were
downregulated (Supplementary Fig. S1) following SNRPE
depletion. Looking for genes involved in autophagy, we found
that mTOR was among the most downregulated gene in
SNRPE-depleted cells (Supplementary Fig. S6). Importantly,
this decrease was robust as evidenced by the similar behavior
of all the 142 probes covering the mTOR mRNA (Fig. 6A). This
decrease (5-fold) in mTOR mRNA abundance in SNRPE-depleted cells was conﬁrmed by RT-qPCR (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, a
decrease in mTOR protein abundance was observed in SNRPEdepleted cells (Fig. 6C).
We next hypothesized that NMD could mediate the mTOR
loss induced by SNRPE-knockdown, as a recent study has
shown that knockdown of SNRPB, another core SNRP spliceosomal protein, resulted in the inclusion of many PTC-containing alternative exons (29). These aberrant PTC-containing
mRNAs are subsequently degraded by the NMD machinery
(29). To determine whether NMD was involved in the disappearance of the mTOR mRNA upon SNRPE depletion, we

The translation inhibitor cycloheximide inhibits mRNA degradation by the NMD pathway, as this process requires
ongoing translation. Following SNRPE depletion, NMD inhibition by cycloheximide resulted in an approximately 2.5-fold
increase in the relative abundance of mTOR mRNA, as
compared with 1.5-fold in control cells (Fig. 6D), suggesting
that a substantial fraction of the mTOR pre-mRNA was
aberrantly spliced into one or more mRNA isoforms that
were degraded by NMD. Our results also showed that mRNA

S7). These data indicated that the cycloheximide-dependent
increase in mTOR mRNA expression was speciﬁc to SNRPE
knockdown.
To next evaluate whether SNRPE depletion could affect
downstream targets of the mTOR signaling pathway, we
assessed the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 that lies just downstream of mTOR. SNRPE depletion induced a dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (Fig. 6C) that indeed indicated a blockage of
mTOR signaling. Overall, these data indicated a global SNRPEdependent deregulation of mTOR signaling.

Discussion
In the present study, we report that components of the Sm
core spliceosomal machinery are overexpressed in cancer,
regulate mTOR, and impact on cell proliferation and autophagy (Fig. 6E).
Indeed, gene expression proﬁling using breast and lung
datasets revealed that genes related to the core spliceosomal
components are highly expressed in lung and breast cancer in
contrast to nontumoral tissue. Moreover, gene expression
analyses using 2 other datasets of ovarian and breast cancers
indicated that overexpression of genes encoding spliceosome
complex components could be associated with a more aggressive phenotype of cancers and could deﬁne a subset of highly
malignant cancers. Among these genes involved in spliceosome complex, those encoding the core spliceosomal proteins
SNRPE and SNRPD1 were consistently found to be among the
top differentially expressed genes in the 4 series of samples.
Several studies have previously suggested that components
of the splicing machinery are mutated or overexpressed in

malignant diseases. Indeed, mutations in genes encoding the
U2AF35, ZRSR2, SRSF2, and SF3B1 splicing factors have been
found in hematologic malignancies (16). Sampath and colleagues reported that the splicing factor SPF45 was overexpressed
in carcinoma from various origins including breast, lung, ovary,
colon, and prostate (30). This group also reported that SPF45
overexpression was associated with resistance to cyclophosphamide (30). More recently, Niu and colleagues reported that
proteins involved in splicing machinery were overexpressed in
8 samples of bladder cancer, as compared with normal tissue
(31). The present study based on larger number of samples
suggests that genes encoding the spliceosome core machinery
are overexpressed in solid tumors. Overexpression of spliceosomal component is not only a hallmark of cancer but also
could be a therapeutic target. Indeed, we have shown here that
depletion of several components of the core spliceosome (i.e.,
SNRPE or SNRPD1) has a selective action on the proliferation
of transformed cell lines but not of an immortalized nontumorigenic cell line (MCF-10A). In addition, SNRPE depletion

leads to inhibition of mTOR expression. This effect may, in part,
be the consequence of the production of aberrantly spliced
mTOR mRNA isoforms degraded by the NMD pathway, as we
have found here that NMD inhibition by cycloheximide results in
an increase in the relative abundance of mTOR mRNA. Furthermore, a recent study reports that regulation of mTOR alternative
splicing leads to the production of a short transcript degraded by
NMD during adipogenesis (32). Strikingly, by regulating mTOR,
SNRPE impacts on one of the most often deregulated signaling
pathways in cancer. mTOR is a key component that coordinately
regulates the balance between growth and autophagy in

stress (33). Consistent with this observation, we have shown here
that targeting SNRPE or SNRPD1 leads to cell death through
autophagy. Interestingly, a recent report using a short hairpin
RNA screening procedure in Drosophila melanogaster identiﬁed
the spliceosome machinery as one of the main pathway regulating the mTORC1 signaling pathway (34). This observation,
together with our study, highlights the importance of the
spliceosome–mTOR axis and reinforces the interest of the core
splicecosome as an interesting target in the control of eukaryotic
cell growth and death.
These ﬁndings open up new avenues for drug development.
Several drugs have already been developed to target the

Figure 6. Knockdown of SNRPE alters mTOR expression and downstream signaling pathway. A, analysis of mTOR expression by exon arrays in SNRPEdepleted or control (nontargeting siRNA) SKBr-3 cells. mTOR expression was analyzed by exon arrays. mTOR expression is represented in a green–red heat
color coding from low expression (light green) to high expression (red color) for transfected (~) and control (*) cells separately. The x-axis corresponds to the
rank of mTOR probes in the control cells sorted by their expression in an increasing order. B, mTOR mRNA expression was analyzed by RT-qPCR
in SNRPE-depleted or control (nontargeting siRNA) SKBr-3 cells. The graph represents mTOR mRNA level (fold change) normalized using housekeeping
genes. C, expression of SNRPE and different mTOR downstream proteins was analyzed by Western blotting in SNRPE-depleted or control (nontargeting
siRNA) SKBr-3 cells. D, for NMD inhibition experiments, cells were transfected with speciﬁc SNRPE siRNA or nontargeting control siRNA.
Three days later, cells were treated for 8 hours with 100 mg/mL cycloheximide (CHX) or with an equivalent amount of DMSO as a control. mTOR RNA
expression was detected by RT-PCR. Quantiﬁcations of the RT-PCR signals were calculated from RT-PCR assays carried out on samples from 2 independent
transfections. The graph represents the ratio of mTOR mRNA expression in cells treated with cycloheximide as compared with untreated cells and
shows that NMD inhibition resulted in an approximately 2.5-fold increase in the relative abundance of mTOR mRNA in SNRPE-depleted cells as compared with
1.5-fold increase in control cells. E, schematic representation of the sequence of processes leading from targeting SNRPE and SNRPD1 by speciﬁc siRNAs
to the inhibition of mTOR survival pathway. The spliceosomal machinery complex is formed from 5 RNP subunits, termed uridine-rich (U-rich) small
snRNPs. Each snRNP (U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6) consists of a uridine-rich snRNA complexed with a set of Sm proteins (B/B2, D1, D2, D3, E, F, and G) forming
a ring core structure that encompasses RNA. The colored circles refer to the most signiﬁcantly overexpressed Sm core proteins in the studied datasets

Spliceosome as a Target for Anticancer Treatment

splicing process. Using a chemical library, Soret and colleagues
have reported that ellipticine inhibits several splicing events in
vitro through targeting splicing regulatory factors such as SR
protein (35). This drug has been used in the last 30 years as
chemotherapy agent in breast cancer. Consistent studies have
shown that ellipticine was associated with a strong antitumor
effect in patients with breast cancer. More recently, 2 compounds spliceostatin A and the pladienolide derivatives, were
independently reported to interact with SF3b, a subcomplex of
U2 snRNP, which is an essential component of the spliceosome
(25, 26). The binding of pladienolide and spliceostatin A to SF3b
leads to an inhibition of the spliceosomal functions resulting in
impaired splicing and thus altered gene expression patterns.
Pladienolide derivative compounds exhibited potent anti-cancer activity in several cancer cell lines and human tumor
xenografts (36). Treatment of a drug screen panel of 39 cancer
cell lines with pladienolides resulted in major growth inhibition with greatest activity against breast and lung cancer cell
lines (37). Spliceostatin A affects also proliferation of numerous
cancer cell lines and inhibits tumor growth in various xenograft
models (38). On the basis of the promising preclinical data with
respect to the potential anticancer activity of pladienolide,
phase I dose-escalation trials with pladienolide D were initiated in Europe and United States. The previously mentioned
drugs target splicing regulators [i.e., SRSF/serine-arginine-rich
(SR) splicing factors] or constitutive splicing factors (e.g., SF3b)
but not the core spliceosomal machinery. Also, as they are
derived from natural compounds, they do not speciﬁcally
target splicing machinery. On the basis of the present study,
there is a rationale to design chemical compounds that speciﬁcally target SNRPE and SNRPD1. Other therapeutic strategies are possible to inhibit spliceosome activity. It has been
reported that spliceosome activity is regulated by kinases,
including SRPK1 (39). This could provide a rationale to develop

kinase inhibitors that would eventually lead to the inhibition of
spliceosome activity.
Overall, our results suggest that core spliceosome machinery
could be an attractive therapeutic target in malignant solid
tumors. These ﬁndings provide a rationale to design new drugs
targeting SNRPE, SNRPD1, and to develop spliceostatin A and
the pladienolide derivatives for patients with SNRPE/SNRPD1overexpressing cancers.
