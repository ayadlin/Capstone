BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the relation between the kinetics of prostatespecific antigen (PSA) decline after the initiation of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) and overall survival (OS) in men with metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC). METHODS: The authors’
institutional database was used to identify a cohort of men with metastatic HSPC who were treated with
ADT. Patients were included if they had at least 2 serum PSA determinations before PSA nadir and at least
1 serum PSA value available within 1 month of ADT initiation. Patient characteristics, PSA at ADT initiation,
nadir PSA, time to PSA nadir (TTN), and PSA decline (PSAD) in relation to OS were analyzed. RESULTS:
One hundred seventy-nine patients were identified, and they had a median follow-up after ADT initiation of
4 years. The median OS after ADT initiation was 7 years. The median PSA level at ADT initiation and PSA
nadir were 47 ng/mL and 0.28 ng/mL, respectively. On univariate analysis: TTN <6 months, PSAD >52 ng/
mL per year, PSA nadir 0.2 ng/mL, PSA 47.2 ng/mL at ADT initiation, and Gleason score >7 were associated with shorter OS. On multivariate analysis, TTN <6 months, Gleason score >7, and PSA nadir 0.2 ng/
mL independently predicted shorter OS. CONCLUSIONS: To the authors’ knowledge, this was the first
report to demonstrate that a faster time to reach a PSA nadir after the initiation of ADT was associated
with shorter survival duration in men with metastatic HSPC. These results need confirmation but
may indicate that a rapid initial response to ADT indicates more aggressive disease. Cancer 2009;115:981–7.

Androgen -deprivation therapy (ADT) is the most
effective systemic therapy for patients who have hormonesensitive prostate cancer (HSPC). Most patients will experience a substantial decline in prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) levels, and PSA levels may remain low or undetectable for years. Nevertheless, the emergence of castrationresistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is typical.1 Once CRPC
develops, the median survival is approximately 24 to 36
months.
PSA kinetics have been established as useful prognostic indicators for survival in different clinical settings.
For instance, a high pretherapy PSA velocity (PSAV) is
associated with a greater risk of death from prostate cancer
despite radical prostatectomy2 or external beam radiation
therapy (EBRT).3 Similarly, the PSA doubling time with
biochemical recurrence after definitive local therapy is
able to identify patients who are at high risk of prostate
cancer-specific mortality.4 However, the influence of PSA
kinetics post-ADT initiation on the outcome of patients
with metastatic HSPC is poorly characterized. A recent
large study suggested that a PSA level 4 ng/mL after
7 months of ADT is a strong predictor of survival in
this population.5 We queried a longitudinal database of
patients who were treated at the Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute (DFCI) to describe the outcome of ADT use in
men with HSPC who had metastases at the time ADT
was initiated. Our objective was to determine which parameters of PSA kinetics predicted overall survival (OS).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Database
The cohort was generated from the Prostate Clinical
Research Information System (CRIS) at DFCI. The
CRIS system consists of data entry software, a central data
repository, collection of patient data (including comprehensive follow-up of all patients), and tightly integrated
security measures. This system recently was described.6
Data are stored in an Oracle relational database (Oracle,
Inc., Redwood Shores, Calif). The current version of
Prostate CRIS became available for prospective data entry
in November 2001. All patients who are seen at DFCI
and Brigham and Women’s Hospital with a diagnosis of
prostate cancer are approached to participate. The consent
rate is >85%. In general, patients are followed every 3
982

months with PSA tests and radiologic examinations if
needed.

Patient Selection
We identified and included patients with prostate cancer
who had been treated with ADT (orchiectomy or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists with or without
an antiandrogen) for metastatic HSPC. Patients had consented to provide information on the CRIS protocol and
had blood collected for research purposes. Patients were
eligible if they had metastatic disease when they started
ADT, if they had at least 1 PSA value within 1 month
before the initiation of ADT (84.4% of all patients) or
after ADT initiation (15.6% of all patients), and if they
had at least 2 PSA values available before nadir PSA
(including nadir PSA). Patients were excluded either if
they had only 2 PSA values available and the second value
was obtained >1 year after the first measure or if their
PSA level increased after ADT initiation.

Statistical Considerations
Patient and disease characteristics were summarized as the
number (%) of patients or the median and range of values.
The time to PSA nadir (TTN) was defined as the duration
of time from the initiation of ADT to the date the lowest
PSA value first was observed after ADT. PSA decline
(PSAD) was calculated from the slope of the linear regression of the raw PSA values over time using PSA values
from 1 month before ADT to the nadir PSA.
The primary outcome variable was OS, which was
defined as the time from ADT initiation to the date of
death, and patients were censored at the last known date
that they were alive. The distribution of OS was estimated
using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method; median
survival and OS along with 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) were summarized. OS was compared according to
patients’ characteristics using log-rank tests. Continuous
variables were dichotomized at the median value within
the cohort with the exception of PSA nadir, which was
dichotomized at 0.2 ng/mL because of its known correlation with prostate cancer-specific survival. Because PSA
nadir, TTN, and PSAD were measures that developed
over time after ADT initiation, we also conducted secondary analyses of OS from the landmarks of PSA nadir on

Multivariate modeling was undertaken to arrive at a parsimonious model to predict OS; hazard ratios (HRs), 95%

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics and
Prostate-Specific Antigen Kinetics
One-hundred seventy-nine patients met the eligibility criteria for this analysis (Table 1). The median age of the
cohort at ADT initiation was 64 years (range, 42-84
years). Forty-seven percent of patients had a Gleason score
>7, and 32% of patients had metastatic disease (M1) at
diagnosis.
The median time from diagnosis to the initiation of
ADT was 0.3 years (interquartile range [IQR], 0.1-4.9
years). Eighty percent of patients received an antiandrogen as part of ADT. The median PSA level at ADT initiaCancer

tion was 47 ng/mL, and the median PSA nadir was 0.28
ng/mL; 45% of patients reached a PSA nadir <0.2 ng/
mL. The median TTN was 6 months, and the median
PSAD level after the initiation of ADT was 52 ng/mL per
year. The PSA levels at the start of ADT were similar
between the groups with short (<6 months) and prolonged (6 months) TTN (median, 31 ng/mL vs 55.6
ng/mL; P ¼ .21). However, the group with rapid PSAD
(>52 ng/mL per year) had much higher baseline PSA levels compared with the group with slow PSAD (median,
146 ng/mL vs 12.5 ng/mL; P < .0001). Patients who had
a rapid PSAD or shorter TTN also were less likely to
achieve a PSA nadir <0.2 ng/mL (P < .05).

Univariate and Multivariate Analyses of
Predictors for Overall Survival
With a median follow-up of 4 years (range, 0.3-13.6
years), 63 patients (35%) patients died. The median OS
after ADT initiation was 7 years (95% CI, 4.9-9.4 years;
range, 0.3-13.6 years). Table 2 summarizes survival estimates at 1-year intervals after the initiation of ADT.
Several factors were identified that predicted OS after the initiation of ADT on univariate analysis (Table 3).

A Gleason score >7, higher PSA at the initiation of ADT,
higher PSA nadir, shorter TTN, and a more rapid PSAD
all were associated with a shorter OS. Figure 1 provides
OS curves that were calculated according to TTN (<6
months vs 6 months; log-rank P ¼ .01) and PSAD
(<52 ng/mL per year vs 52 ng/mL per year; log-rank

variables or that compared survival for those who had
been alive for at least 1 year after ADT initiation were

consistent with our initial results. It is noteworthy that
previous local therapy (radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy) was associated with OS on univariate analysis (P ¼
.009) but not on multivariate analysis (P ¼ .98).
In multivariate analysis, statistically significant predictors for OS were PSA nadir, TTN, and Gleason score.
Higher PSA nadir (0.2 ng/mL), shorter TTN (<6
months), and higher Gleason (>7) were associated with
shorter survival (Table 4, Model 1). We also investigated
whether the association of TTN with OS was modified by
the levels of PSA nadir (Table 4, Model 2). The results
indicated that the relation between prolonged TTN and
improved survival became more apparent in patients who
had a PSA nadir 0.2 ng/mL (hazard ratio [HR], 0.31;
95% CI, 0.16-0.62). However, in the group of patients
who had a PSA nadir <0.2 ng/mL, TTN had no influence
on survival (HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.42-2.40; interaction
effect, P ¼ .04). A Kaplan-Meier plot of survival by PSA
nadir and TTN (Fig. 2) indicated that the 2 survival distributions (TTN 6 months vs TTN <6 months)
crossed, and there was a lot of early censoring among
patients who had a PSA nadir <0.2 ng/mL, which

suggested that the association between survival and TTN
remained unclear in patients who achieved a very low
nadir in this cohort. The results were consistent when
variables were analyzed on a continuous basis rather
than dichotomized (data not shown).

DISCUSSION
In 2007, the American Society of Clinical Oncology published clinical practice guidelines on the initial hormone
management of androgen-sensitive, metastatic prostate
cancer.7 ADT remains the mainstay of treatment for men
with metastatic HSPC. PSA kinetics before definitive curative-intent therapy and during biochemical recurrence
when these therapies fail are established prognostic factors
associated with outcome.2,3,8
Petrylak et al observed that a decline in PSA velocity
after beginning treatment with docetaxel chemotherapy,
were associated with OS.9 An analysis from the TAX327
trial of docetaxel versus mitoxantrone in metastatic, hormone-refractory prostate cancer10 demonstrated that a
PSAD 30% within 3 months of initiating chemotherapy had the highest degree of surrogacy for OS, confirming data from the Southwest Oncology Group 9916 trial.
By using data from a randomized phase 3 trial,
Hussain et al recently reported that a PSA value 4 ng/mL
after 7 months of ADT was a strong independent
predictor of improved survival in new, metastatic HSPC.5

Those results may allow the identification of patients who
are unlikely to benefit with standard ADT long before
they develop castration-resistant disease, thus providing
an alternative to investigating newer therapies. Unfortunately, the influence of PSA kinetics like PSAD, TTN,
and others as predictors of survival in patients with metastatic but HSPC remains largely unknown. Most studies
have evaluated ‘PSA responses’5,11,12 as a surrogate for
survival. Overall, the efficacy of ADT has been correlated
with more profound PSADs that reflect subsequently
improved survival. In our dataset, a lower PSA nadir, as
expected, was associated independently with longer survival. We also attempted to examine other parameters of
PSA kinetics to refine the predictive information in this
context.
It is noteworthy that a more rapid PSAD and a
shorter TTN (a cutoff of 6 months was used for convenience, because this was the median value) were associated
with shorter survival, and TTN was associated independently with survival even after adjusting for several other
variables. We believed that it was reasonable to assume
that a rapid PSAD and reaching PSA nadir ‘faster’ would
indicate more cancer cell death that, subsequently, would
translate into a higher survival, similar to the data regarding docetaxel chemotherapy in hormone-refractory disease.9 Because of our findings, we hypothesize that
perhaps this is an ADT-specific phenomenon only; the
rapid fall in PSA may not be related to cell viability and
simply may be a transcriptional effect from ADT on PSA
986

production rather than cell death. Another possible explanation is that we may have selected a subset of aggressive
prostate cancer cells that quickly became resistant to ADT
or were not as reliant on the androgen receptor for viability. In fact, significant clinical heterogeneity may exist in
metastatic HSPC, as supported by the data of Hussain et
al, who observed a striking variability in survival: Patients
in their study had median survival differences that ranged
from 13 months to 75 months, depending on the absolute
PSA nadir achieved.
In the current study, the association between TTN
and survival was limited only to patients who had a PSA
nadir >0.2 ng/mL. We also attempted to examine the
length of time from the initiation of ADT to the first documentation of a PSA level 0.2 ng/mL, because some
investigators equate a PSA level 0.2 ng/mL with an
undetectable PSA, especially with less sensitive PSA
assays. By using this alternative definition, the results were
not different for patients who did not achieve a PSA nadir
0.2 ng/mL. However, there was no association between
TTN and survival for those who were able to achieve a
PSA nadir 0.2 ng/mL after ADT. The relation between
TTN and survival deserves further investigation in
patients with a lower PSA nadir.
Rapid PSAD predicted a worse survival in the univariate analysis but did not retain its importance in the
multivariate models when we included Gleason score,
PSA nadir, and TTN. We also observed a strong association between PSAD and PSA at the start of ADT.
Although the variability in PSA was relatively large (range,
0-15,090 ng/mL; IQR, 12.3-167 ng/mL) at the initiation
of ADT, nearly 75% of patients in this cohort achieved a
PSA level 3 ng/mL within 6 months of ADT. Therefore,
the rate of PSAD was determined primarily by the PSA
level at ADT initiation.
To our knowledge, our findings have not been
reported previously in studies of ADT. This report is the
first to use PSA kinetics (such as TTN) outcome measure
to evaluate ADT efficacy in metastatic HSPC. This analysis has some potential pitfalls. First, it is retrospective. The
measurements of PSA kinetics will depend on the number
and the pattern of PSA testing post-ADT initiation. The
quality of the data, however, should be high, because we
performed a quality-control analysis and observed the
numbers of available PSA values at 6 months of ADT
were similar between the groups with shorter and longer

TTN. Second, although all patients had metastatic
HSPC, this analysis also drew on patients with heterogeneous clinical backgrounds that were not controlled for in
the context of a prospective clinical trial. Some important
factors, such as lactate dehydrogenase, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and hemoglobin, were not included in this analysis, because they are
not measured routinely in patients who receive ADT at
our institution. Finally, we did not study patients who
never received ADT or those who received antiandrogens
alone; however, we believe that those patients represent
rare case scenarios.
To summarize, we observed that PSA kinetics at the
initiation of ADT could predict OS in patients with metastatic HSPC and that faster TTN and more rapid PSAD
were associated with a shorter OS. We postulate that this
may be a consequence of underlying biologic differences
in tumor heterogeneity. Further prospective data and
external validation in independent datasets are needed to
confirm these finding.
