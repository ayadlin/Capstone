ABSTRACT
Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children.
Success of current therapies is still limited and outcome is particularly poor for
metastatic alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (aRMS). We previously identified the
proprotein convertase furin as potential target for specific drug delivery with RMShoming peptides. Furin is a protease that converts inactive precursor proteins into
bioactive proteins and peptides. In this study, we investigate the biological role of
furin in aRMS progression in vitro and in vivo. Furin expression was confirmed in over
86% RMS biopsies in a tissue microarray (n=89). Inducible furin silencing in vitro led
to significant impairment of cell viability and proliferation in all investigated aRMS
cell lines, but not in MRC5 fibroblasts. Furthermore, the aRMS cell lines Rh3 and Rh4
revealed to be very sensitive to furin silencing, undergoing caspase-dependent cell
death. Notably, furin silencing in vivo led to complete remission of established Rh4
tumors and to delayed growth in Rh30 tumors. Taken together, these findings identify
furin as an important factor for aRMS progression and survival. Thus, we propose
furin as a novel therapeutic target for treatment of aRMS.

and increased levels of the receptor correlate with poorer
outcome in aRMS patients [7]. The ligand of IGF1R, the
insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2), is overexpressed in
RMS [8] and acts as an autocrine mitogen [9]. Therefore,
the IGF1R signaling pathway is a promising target to treat
aRMS tumors. Different approaches to disrupt IGF1R
signaling in RMS have been investigated: IGF1R antisense RNA [10], IGF1R-specific blocking antibodies [11]
and the selective IGF1R inhibitor NVP-AEW541 [12].
Proteolytic processing of precursor proteins by
proprotein convertases (PCs) produces a large variety
of bioactive proteins, such as growth factors, receptors,
enzymes and cell-adhesion molecules. PCs are calciumdependent serine proteases and seven of the nine family
members (PC1, PC2, furin, PC4, PC5, paired basic amino
acid cleaving enzyme 4 (PACE4) and PC7) process
proproteins at basic residues. The other two, SK-1 and
PCSK9, cleave after non-basic residues [13]. Enhanced
activity of PCs has been associated with pathological
conditions like Alzheimer’s disease [14] and correlates

INTRODUCTION
Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common
pediatric soft tissue sarcoma, representing 5-8% of all
childhood cancers. RMS is subdivided in two main
histological subgroups, embryonal (eRMS) and alveolar
(aRMS) RMS. aRMS is more aggressive and is associated
with a poorer prognosis with a 5-year survival of 48%
[1]. Around 80% of aRMS tumors harbor the chimeric
transcription factor PAX3/7-FOXO1 inducing a specific
gene expression signature [2, 3]. A dominant role of
PAX3/7-FOXO1 as oncogenic driver has been suggested
[4, 5]. Despite the dependence of aRMS tumors on
PAX3/7-FOXO1 expression, transcription factors in
general represent a challenging target.
Thus, many efforts have been made to characterize
key pathways driving RMS progression in order to identify
targets for novel therapeutic approaches. The insulin-like
growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) is one among them.
IGF1R is a transcriptional target of PAX3-FOXO1 [6]

with increased malignancy of certain cancer types such
as prostate cancer, colon carcinoma or small cell lung
carcinoma [15–17].
Furin was the first identified PC and acts within
the constitutive secretory pathway [18]. It processes
many cancer-related proteins like IGF1R [16], the
vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) [19]
or the membrane-type 1 matrix metalloprotease (MT1MMP) [20]. Aberrant furin expression is associated with
neoplasias like head and neck cancer, breast, lung or
colon cancers [21–24]. Upregulation of furin expression
and translocation to the plasma membrane under hypoxic
conditions are considered to favor invasiveness of cancer
cells through enhanced proteolytic activation of MT1MMP and TGFβ [25, 26]. Thus, furin is a key activator of
proproteins involved in cancer progression and represents
a promising target to improve cancer treatment. Furin
is endogenously inhibited by its own prodomain that is
cleaved in a two-step autocatalytic activation process
and the use of the prodomain as furin inhibitor has been
proposed [27, 28]. Alternative inhibitory approaches are
application of polyarginines [29], nanobodies [30] or α1antitrypsin Portland (PDX) [31]. However, most if not all
proposed inhibitors lack selectivity for furin and are still
in early developmental phases.
We previously identified specific RMS homing
peptides that bind to the proprotein convertase (PC)
furin [32]. Here, we investigate in detail the role of
furin in aRMS progression in vitro and in vivo. We use
inducible expression of furin specific shRNA to decrease
furin expression and activity. Furin silencing resulted
in impaired cell viability, caspase-dependent apoptosis
and regression of tumors. We further found that furin is
expressed in most patient biopsies. Therefore, we propose
the proprotein convertases furin as novel target for aRMS
therapy.

activity is indeed lowered upon silencing of furin (Figure
1C). mRNA levels of other PCs, examined by qRTPCR after 48h of treatment with 25 ng/mL DOX, were
unaffected suggesting that furin silencing was specific and
was not compensated for by increased mRNA expression
of other PCs (Supplementary Figure S1B). In conclusion,
we generated and validated aRMS cell lines with
functional furin silencing that is inducible by application
of DOX. Furthermore, effects of furin silencing on
IGF1R processing and downstream Akt activation upon
stimulation with IGF1 could be demonstrated in Rh3
cells (Figure 1D) and to a lesser extent in Rh4 cells
(Supplementary Figure S1C). This suggests that activation
of the IGF signaling pathway is furin dependent at least in
a subset of aRMS cells.

Furin silencing decreases cell viability and
proliferation
Furin processes a variety of substrates, e.g. IGF1R,
that support cancer cell viability and proliferation. Thus,
we induced furin silencing in four different aRMS cell
lines, Rh30, Rh4, CW9019 and Rh3, and assessed cell
viability. Cell viability was clearly decreased, as compared
to non-treated cells (Figure 2A - Rh30: 27%, Rh4: 7%;
Supplementary Figure S2A - CW9019: 48%, Rh3: 19%).
The number of viable adherent cells was reduced up to
5-fold compared to non-treated cells (Figure 2B - Rh30:
23%, Rh4: 20%; Supplementary Figure S2B - CW9019:
54%, Rh3: 23%). Furthermore, proliferation, examined
by BrdU incorporation, was much lower in furin silenced
Rh30 and Rh4 cells than in cells expressing control
shRNA and went down to 48% and 15%, respectively
(Figure 2C). We also noted a slight toxic effect upon
expression of the control shRNA (scri) in all aRMS cell
lines (Figure 2A–2C). Since DOX application alone had
no effect on viability of aRMS wt cells (data not shown),
we assume that this slight effect may be due to high
shRNA expression after DOX treatment. Furthermore, we
investigated furin silencing in MRC5 fibroblast cells and
found that induced silencing of furin had no significant
impact on viability of MRC5 fibroblast cells (Figures 2D
and 2E). Thus, furin activity seems to be a critical factor
in viability and proliferation of aRMS cells, whereby a
decrease of furin does not alter cell viability of normal
fibroblasts.

RESULTS
Validation of inducible furin silencing in alveolar
RMS cells
In order to simulate specific furin inhibition we
generated stable aRMS cell lines with tetracyclinedependent expression of furin shRNA (shFAi and shFEi)
or control shRNA (scri) (Figure 1A). Furin silencing was
assessed 24-72h after doxycycline (DOX) treatment. Upon
DOX treatment furin mRNA was reduced to around 15%
in Rh30 cells (Figure 1B) and to 6.5-25% in other aRMS
cell lines (Supplementary Figure S1A). Subsequently,
we analyzed furin protein levels in Rh30 cells by
immunoblotting und could confirm that furin protein
levels were strongly reduced upon DOX treatment (Figure
1C). To monitor furin activity we analyzed the maturation
of a known furin substrate, IGF1Rβ. Decrease of furin led
to clear reduction of mature IGF1Rβ, indicating that furin

Reduced furin activity results in caspasedependent cell death involving mitochondria
In our initial investigation of aRMS cell viability
upon furin silencing we observed that reduced furin
activity not only impaired cell viability and proliferation
of the cells, but also led to morphological changes and
cell death in Rh4 and Rh3 cells. Therefore, we examined
the cell cycle distribution of Rh4 and Rh3 cells 72h after

sub-G1 phase (Figure 3A - shFAi: 54-62%, shFEi: 2632%). As a positive control for apoptosis we treated aRMS
cells with a combination of 1 μM of the IGF1R-inhibitor
AEW451 (AEW) and 275 nM of the dual PI3K/mTOR

inhibitor BEZ235 (BEZ) for 24h, conditions that induce
apoptosis in aRMS cell lines [33]. As expected, treatment
with BEZ/AEW led to an increase of cells in sub-G1
phase (Figure 3A - Rh4: 22%, Rh3: 18%). To assess the
contribution of caspases in cell death induction we treated

Cell cycle profiles of furin silenced or BEZ/AEW treated
cells were restored in the presence of zVAD similar to
non-treated levels, indicating that induced cell death is
caspase dependent (Figure 3A).

To further elucidate the mechanism underlying cell
death, we analyzed cleavage of caspase-7 and -9 and PARP
by immunoblotting. In Rh4 and Rh3 cells, both caspases
as well as PARP were cleaved upon furin silencing and
BEZ/AEW treatment, confirming apoptosis induction.

Cleavage of the effector caspase-7 and of PARP could be
almost completely prevented in the presence of zVAD,
whereby inhibition of caspase-9 cleavage was incomplete
(Figure 3B). Caspase activity of the caspases-3 and -7
was elevated 5 to 7-fold upon furin silencing in Rh4 and
Rh3 (Figure 3C and data not shown), but not in Rh30 or
CW9019 cells (data not shown). This suggests that in some
aRMS cells furin silencing mainly inhibits proliferation
and viability, whereas in other aRMS cell lines a decrease
in furin activity additionally induces caspase-dependent
cell death. Therefore, application of zVAD to Rh4 cells
upon induction of furin silencing only partially rescued
cell viability as assessed by measuring cell viability and
number of attached cells (Supplementary Figure S3A and
S3B). In this case caspase inhibition prevented apoptosis,
but did not decrease anti-proliferative processes.
To examine the involvement of mitochondria in
apoptosis induced by furin silencing we generated Rh4 cells
with a stable double knock out of BAX and BAK (BAX/
BAK) or control (sc) knock out. Levels of BAX and BAK
proteins in heterogeneous cell pools were investigated by
immunoblotting. For both proteins knock out efficiency
was almost complete (Supplementary Figure S4). Rh4 cells
with BAX/BAK or control knock out were then transduced
with inducible furin shRNA as described above. In control
knock out Rh4 caspase-3/7 activity peaked at 48h for shFAi
and at 72h for shFEi and was elevated 7.9-fold or 7.4-fold
when compared to non-treated cells. In contrast, caspase-3/7
activity levels were increased only minimally upon furin
silencing in the absence of BAX and BAK (Figure 3C).
Furin silencing in Rh4 and Rh3 cells further stimulated
activation of BAX, as was shown by immunoprecipitation
of BAX with active conformation-specific antibodies
(Figure 3D). These results suggest that furin silencing leads
to caspase-dependent apoptosis that relies on mitochondria
pore formation through BAX and BAK.

relapsed 9-20 days later, whereby the last tumor of this
group never relapsed, not even after DOX withdrawal 60
days post remission. None of the Rh4 shFEi DOX-treated
mice relapsed (Figure 4B). Assessment of furin mRNA by
qRT-PCR revealed that only half of Rh4 shFAi DOX-treated
relapsed tumors maintained low levels of furin. The other
two tumors showed higher furin mRNA levels (41% and
75% over control treated Rh4 shFAi tumors), indicating a
possible outgrowth of cells with ineffective furin silencing
(Figure 4C). To further investigate the mechanisms leading
to remission of Rh4 shFAi and shFEi tumors upon DOX
administration, we sacrificed few mice 5 days after initial
administration of DOX. Decreased furin mRNA levels
were confirmed by qRT-PCR (Supplementary Figure
S5 - shFAi: around 30%; shFEi: 15%). Total protein was
extracted from tumor tissue and protein levels of different
cell death markers were examined by immunoblotting. The
three tumors with lower furin levels displayed elevated
levels of cleaved caspase-9 and -7 and cleaved PARP as
compared to Rh4 scri tumors (Figure 4D). Furthermore,
Rh4 shFEi, but especially shFAi tumors showed high levels
of cleaved caspase-3 after 5 days of DOX treatment (Figure
4E). Expression of scri in control tumors did not lead to
activation of this effector caspase.
Thus, we could show that induced silencing of
furin leads to full remission of Rh4 tumors in vivo. This
is most likely achieved through initiation of apoptotic
processes, as shown by activation of key caspases. Beside
reactivation of furin expression, other, yet undetermined,
processes might lead to relapse of tumors and should be
further investigated.

Tumor growth of Rh30 xenografts in vivo is
delayed after furin silencing
Induction of furin silencing diminished proliferation
and cell viability of Rh30 cells in vitro. To determine
the impact of furin activity on Rh30 tumor growth in
vivo we engrafted 2.5 million Rh30 cells with inducible
furin shRNA and shRNA expression was induced by
administration of DOX-supplemented food 7 days prior
engraftment of tumor cells (Figure 5A). Control groups
were fed normal food. Tumor growth was monitored
over time through caliper measurements and mice were
sacrificed once tumors reached a size of 1000 mm3. Rh30
scri tumor growth was similar with or without DOX
supplement and tumors reached a size of 300 mm3 after 25
days. Conversely, early tumor growth was clearly delayed
in Rh30 shFAi and shFEi tumors in the presence of DOX
and tumors took approximately 50% more time to reach 300
mm3 (Figure 5B, shFAi - no DOX: 21 days, DOX: 31 days;
shFEi - no DOX: 22 days, DOX: 34 days). After reaching a
size of 300 mm3 most Rh30 tumors grew at the same pace
independent of the genetic background. To investigate furin
silencing efficiency we extracted RNA from tumor tissue
at sacrifice and evaluated furin mRNA levels by qRT-PCR.

Furin silencing results in remission of Rh4
xenografts in vivo
Reduced furin activity decreased cell viability and
proliferation in Rh4 cells and further induced caspasedependent apoptosis in vitro. To examine the role of furin in
Rh4 tumor growth we engrafted 3.25 million cells harboring
either inducible furin shRNA (shFAi and shFEi) or control
shRNA (scri). In order to simulate a potential therapy
aiming at abrogating furin activity in established tumors,
mice were treated with DOX once tumors reached a size
of 200-300 mm3 (Figure 4A). Mice were sacrificed upon
reaching a tumor size of 1000 mm3. PBS-treated tumors
took on average 16-17 days to attain this size (Figure 4Bscri: 17 days; shFAi: 16.6 days; shFEi: 16.5 days). Rh4 scri
tumors treated with DOX showed slightly decelerated tumor
growth and took on average 25 days to reach a size of 1000
mm3. In contrast, Rh4 shFAi and shFEi tumors went into
full remission after 10-15 days. 4 out of 5 Rh4 shFAi tumors

Most RMS biopsies express furin

Furin mRNA levels of Rh30 shFAi or shFEi tumors with
DOX as compared to respective tumors without DOX
were on average 15% and 11%, respectively (Figure 5C),
confirming effective furin silencing. Despite having low
furin levels, once furin silenced Rh30 tumors exceeded a
size of approximately 300 mm3, they grew almost as fast
as control tumors. However, a clear delay in early tumor
growth could be observed, suggesting that furin activity is
important in early phases of Rh30 tumor growth in vivo.

To evaluate the potential of furin targeted therapies
in patients we examined furin protein expression in
89 RMS biopsies (74 eRMS, 15 aRMS). A TMA was
stained for furin and expression was graded according
to overall intensity of the staining in tumor cells (Figure
6A). We found that, independent of the subtype, over
86% of RMS tumors expressed low to high amounts of

intermediate expression. A correlation between the level of

of the patients could not be confirmed (data not shown).

death induced upon furin silencing in sensitive cell lines.
It remains to be investigated which proapototic BH3-only
proteins are involved, but treatment of Rh3 and Rh4 cells
with a combination of the IGF1R inhibitor AEW541 and
the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 results in BMFdependent apoptosis [33]. Other proapototic BH3-only
proteins linked to growth factor deprivation are BAD,
BIM and PUMA. For instance, phosphorylation of BAD
through active protein kinase Akt results in binding and
sequestration by 14-3-3 scaffold proteins [36, 37]. Thus,
lower levels of activated Akt due to decreased IGF
signaling upon furin silencing might promote release
of BAD and mitochondria pore formation. Further
investigations will be required to elucidate the exact
mechanism of cell death after silencing of furin.
To examine the impact of furin silencing on aRMS
tumor growth in vivo we engrafted two aRMS cell lines,
Rh30 and the sensitive Rh4. In Rh30 xenografts, upon
furin silencing, we observed delay of early tumor growth,
suggesting that furin cleaves one or more precursor
proteins that are crucial for early steps of aRMS tumor
growth after xenotransplantation.
A signaling pathway likely to be involved is the
VEGF signaling axis. Gee et al. confirmed expression
of VEGF, VEGFR1, which is a transcriptional target of
PAX3-FOXO1 [38], and VEGFR2 in aRMS cell lines
and were the first to propose a role of VEGF signaling in
RMS growth [39]. Processing of precursor VEGF-C and
VEGF-D through furin allows their binding to VEGFR2
and induction of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis [19, 40–
42]. Additionally, only furin-processed VEGF-C induces
tumorigenesis in mice [19], highlighting the importance

DISCUSSION
This study establishes for the first time a link
between furin activity and rhabdomyosarcoma
progression both in vitro and in vivo. Silencing of furin
led to significantly decreased cell viability and induction
of caspase-dependent apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore,
depletion of furin activity in vivo resulted in regression or
delayed tumor growth of aRMS tumors.
Furin is known to process many growth factors and
their receptors, like IGF-1 and 2, IGF1R or transforming
growth factor β (TGFβ) [34, 35]. Accordingly, silencing
of furin led to significant reduction of cell viability
and proliferation rate in all investigated aRMS cell
lines. Furin silencing had no effect on MRC5 fibroblast
viability, suggesting that aRMS, but not normal cells are
dependent on furin activity. A subset of the aRMS cell
lines tested was particularly sensitive to furin silencing
and underwent BAX/BAK- and caspase-9-dependent
apoptosis. This indicates that furin silencing primarily
triggers the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Others have
shown that disruption of the IGF1R and/or PI3K/mTOR
pathways leads to apoptosis in Rh3 and Rh4 cell lines [12,
33]. In this study we found evidence that activation of the
IGF signaling pathway is dependent on furin activity. We
therefore hypothesize that incomplete activation of growth
factor-dependent pathways is the principal cause of cell

of PC activity in the VEGF signaling axis. Therefore,
reduced VEGF-C and VEGF-D processing upon furin
silencing might suppress proper formation of angiogenic
and lymphangiogenic vessels inside the new tumors and
decrease VEGFR2-dependent aRMS tumor cell growth.
When furin was silenced in established Rh4 tumors,
regression was observed. Apoptosis was induced, as
confirmed by activation of caspases-9, -3 and -7 and PARP
cleavage. Four of the Rh4 shFAi tumors relapsed and furin
re-expression was found in two of them. Since we used
a heterogeneous cell pool, it is likely that outgrowth of
a subset of non-silenced cells caused the relapse. Further
investigations will be required to uncover the underlying
mechanisms of tumor regrowth.

We found furin expression in over 86% of tested
aRMS and eRMS biopsies, but no significant correlation
could be confirmed between furin expression and eventfree or overall survival. It is possible that other riskfactors interacted with the analysis of furin influence
on survival, or that furin expression alone is not a good
marker for its role in cancerogenesis, but rather its
subcellular localization and activity are. Our results
are in line with other studies demonstrating the role
of furin and other PCs for cancer cell survival [15, 28,
43]. Thus, PCs are emerging targets for the treatment
of cancer and development of specific inhibitors will be
of central importance. Levesque et al. recently reported
the improvement of peptide-based specific PACE4

inhibitors for treatment of prostate cancer [44, 45] and
Zhu et al. described the first furin-specific inhibitory
nanobodies [30]. Despite their great clinical potential,
specific inhibitors of furin and furin-like PCs are still in
early phases of development. Besides, the safety of such
inhibitors will have to be closely examined as most PCs
are widely expressed in human tissues. Nevertheless,
disruption of furin activity has been used successfully
to enhance an anti-tumor immune response in patients
with advanced cancers. Safety and efficient immune
response of an autologous tumor cell vaccine (FANG)
that combines furin shRNA and expression of GM-CSF
were confirmed and benefits of treatment were observed
from phase I trials in Ewing sarcoma and hepatocellular
carcinoma patients [46–48]. Additionally, increased
presence of furin on the cell surface of tumor cells could
be used for targeted delivery of chemotherapeutics, as
we could show previously that furin is the target receptor
for RMS-homing peptides [32]. In conclusion, our data
clearly validate furin as a novel target in aRMS and we
predict that the majority of pediatric RMS patients would
benefit from inhibition of furin activity, either alone or in
the context of immune therapy.

Life Technologies). Cycle threshold (CT) values were
normalized to GAPDH (Hs02758991_g1) or HMBS
(Hs00609296_g1) for cells or tumor tissue, respectively.
Relative expression levels were calculated using the ΔΔCT
method.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

RMS cells were treated with 25 ng/mL DOX for
a total of 48h. After 24h cells were put on starvation
medium (DMEM, 0.2% FBS). Cells were stimulated for
10 min with 50 ng/mL IGF1 (ab73455, Abcam). Cells
were washed with ice-cold PBS and snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen. Whole cell lysates were prepared as described
above and IGF1Rβ, Akt, phosphorylated Akt, Erk1/2 and
phosphorylated Erk1/2 were analyzed by immunoblotting.

Immunoblotting
Total protein extracts from cells or tumor tissue were
separated using 4-12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE gels (Life
Technologies) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes
(PROTAN; Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were
blocked with 5% milk powder in TBS/0.05% Tween and
subsequently incubated with primary antibodies overnight
at 4°C. After washing in TBS, membranes were incubated
with IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked antibody
for 1h at RT. Proteins were detected using ECL detection
reagent (Fisher Scientific) after washing in TBS.

IGF1 stimulation

Cell lines and cell culture
The cell lines Rh4, Rh30 (Peter Houghton, St. Jude
Children’s Hospital, Memphis, TN), Rh3 (Susan Ragsdale,
St. Jude Children’s Hospital, Memphis, TN), CW9019
(Soledad Gallego, Hospital Universitari Vall d’Hebron,
Barcelona, Spain), MRC5 and HEK293T (ATCC, LGC
Promochem) were cultured in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich),
supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin,
2 mM L-glutamine, and 10% FBS (Life Technologies)
in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. aRMS cell lines were tested and
authenticated by cell line typing analysis (STR profiling)
on 2011/2014 and positively matched [49].

Antibodies
Antibodies are described in Supplementary Material
and Methods.

Cell proliferation and viability assays
Cells were seeded in a 96-well format in 100 μL
medium. To assess cell viability 10 μL WST-1 reagent
(Roche) were added. After 30-60 min incubation at 37°C in
the dark absorbance was measured and recorded as ΔOD440. Background values were subtracted. To determine their
640
number, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10
min at RT and stained in 0.05% crystal violet (SigmaAldrich) for 20 min at RT. Excess crystal violet was
removed and cells air dried. Dye was dissolved in 100%
methanol and absorbance was measured at OD594. Cell
proliferation was determined through BrdU incorporation
(Cell Proliferation ELISA, BrdU (Chemiluminescent),
Roche) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Cells
were labeled with BrdU for 2h at 37°C, fixed and stained
for 1h with anti-BrdU-POD solution. Chemiluminescent
substrate was added and luminescence measured.

Production of lentiviral particles and
transduction of cells
Production of lentiviral particles and transduction
of cells are described in Supplementary Material and
Methods.

qRT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cells or tumor tissue
using the Qiagen RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Hombrechtikon,
Switzerland) and reverse-transcribed using oligo (dT)
primers and Omniscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen).
qRT-PCR pas performed for furin (Hs00965485_g1),
PC1 (Hs01026107_m1), PC2 (Hs0015992_m1), PC4

performed on Leica BondMax instruments using Refine
HRP-Kits (Leica DS9800; Leica Microsystems Newcastle,
Ltd.). Dewaxed and pretreated (Epitop Retrieval Buffer 2,
Leica Biosystems, Muttenz, Switzerland; 60 min, 100°C)
paraffin slides were incubated with anti-cleaved caspase-3
antibody (1:500; #9661, Cell Signaling).

Cells were seeded in a 384-well format in 20 μL
medium. At the desired time point 10 μL Caspase Glo®
3/7 Substrate (Promega) were added and plates vigorously
shaken for 1 min. After 30 min incubation at RT in the
dark luminescence was measured.

Tissue microarray

Cell cycle distribution

A tissue microarray with 248 cores from 124 RMS
tumors (17 aRMS with known FOXO1 gene rearrangements
and 107 eRMS) was constructed. Tumors used were
collected at the University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland
and at the Kiel Pediatric Tumor Registry, Germany.
Immunohistochemistry was performed essentially as
described above. Paraffin slides were dewaxed, pretreated
(Epitop Retrieval Buffer 2, Leica Biosystems;10 min,
95°C) and incubated with furin antibody (1:3000; Ab28547,
Abcam). Overall staining was graded according to intensity
and assigned to four different groups (no expression, low,
intermediate or high expression). Tissue microarrays were
analyzed double-blinded.

One million cells were collected and fixed in ice
cold 70% ethanol at -20°C for at least 2h. Fixed cells were
washed in PBS and resuspended in propidium iodide (PI)
solution (20 μg/mL PI and 200 μg/mL RNase A (SigmaAldrich) in PBS/0.1% Triton X-100). PI signal was
assessed by FACS. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed
with FlowJo software, version 10 (TreeStar).

Immunoprecipitation of active BAX
For detection of active BAX, cells were lysed in
CHAPS lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mM
NaCl, 1% CHAPS) as previously described [50]. Briefly,
1000 μg protein were incubated overnight at 4°C with
5 μg mouse anti-BAX antibody (6A7, Sigma) followed
by addition of 10 μL Dynabeads Protein G (Invitrogen)
and further incubation for 2h at 4°C. Dynabeads were
washed with lysis buffer and BAX levels were analyzed
by immunoblotting using rabbit anti-BAX (1:1000; 5023,
Cell Signaling).

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
No potential conflicts of interest.

GRANT SUPPORT
This study was supported by Swiss Research
Foundation Child and Cancer, Cancer League of the
Kanton Zurich, and Forschungskredit University of
Zurich.

Xenograft studies
To study in vivo growth 2.5x106 Rh30 or 3.25x106
Rh4 cells were engrafted subcutaneously in 6-weekold NOD/SCID IL2rg-/- mice (female, 20-25 g; Charles
River). In Rh30 xenografts doxycycline (DOX)supplemented food (625 mg/kg, Synergy Health, Däniken,
Switzerland) was given one week prior engraftment. DOX
administration in Rh4 xenografts was started upon a tumor
size of 200-300 mm3 through intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection
of 0.053 mg DOX/g body weight on two consecutive
days and continuous DOX-supplemented food. Control
treated mice were injected with PBS. Body weight and
tumor growth were monitored over time. Tumor volumes
were determined by measuring two diameters (d1, d2)
in right angles using a digital caliper (V = (4/3) π r3; r =
(d1 + d2)/4). Upon reaching a tumor size of 1000 mm3
mice were sacrificed, tumor tissue was harvested and snap
frozen for RNA and protein extraction.
