intimately linked to tumorigenesis (1). STAT3 is constitutively
activated and overexpressed in various tumor types such as breast
carcinoma, prostate cancer, melanoma, multiple myeloma, and
leukemia.
STAT3 activation involves phosphorylation on a critical tyrosine
residue, Tyr705, by Janus-activated kinases (JAK; refs. 2, 3) and Rac1
(4). It was previously reported that STAT3 is phosphorylated on
Tyr705 through the interleukin (IL)-6/gp130/JAK pathway in breast
cancer cells (5). Another STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation mechanism involves Src family kinases. There are several reports that Src
tyrosine kinase activates STAT3 and Src and STAT3 are
coordinately altered in many human tumors (6–8). Phosphorylation of STAT3 on Tyr705 results in homodimerization or
heterodimerization of STAT3, enabling nuclear localization and
DNA binding (3). Subsequently, STAT3 is phosphorylated on
Ser727, which enhances its transcriptional regulatory activities
(9). In human breast cancer cell lines, phosphorylation of STAT3
Ser727 is associated with the expression or constitutive activation
of epidermal growth factor receptor (10). STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation is mediated by serine threonine kinases, including mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK), c-Jun-NH2-kinase (JNK), and p38
(11–13). Fully activated, dimerized STAT3 molecules bind to
specific DNA response elements and regulate specific target genes.
These target genes include antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-xL, Bcl-2;
ref. 14), proliferation regulatory proteins (Cyclin D1, survivin; refs.
15, 16), and angiogenesis proteins [vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF); ref. 17]. STAT3 is also responsible for the antiimmune response of tumor cells through the blockade of
proinflammatory factor expression (18).
Because of the critical role of STAT3 in tumor cell survival and
its expression in various tumor cells, and the fact that natural
products are still a major source for new drug development (19),
we have screened 3,025 plant extracts, including 342 herbal
medicines and identified modulators of STAT3 activity. We found
that cryptotanshinone from Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (Danshen)
inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT3. Dried roots of Salvia
miltiorrhiza Bunge (Danshen) have commonly been used in
traditional oriental medicine for the treatment of circulatory
disorders, liver disease (20, 21), coronary heart disease, hepatitis,
and chronic renal failure (22). Two major tanshinones, cryptotanshinone and tanshinone IIA, are well-known active components in
this herbal plant. Tanshinone IIA had been reported to have an
anti-inflammatory effect through the inhibition of proinflammatory mediators such as NO, tumor necrosis factor a, IL-1h, and IL-6
in RAW 264.7 cells (23). It was also reported that tanshinone IIA
inhibited leukocyte chemotactic migration (24) and induced
apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (25), human
promyelocytic leukemic cells (26), and human erythroleukemic

Abstract
Because signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
(STAT3) is constitutively activated in most human solid
tumors and is involved in the proliferation, angiogenesis,
immune evasion, and antiapoptosis of cancer cells, researchers have focused on STAT3 as a target for cancer therapy. We
screened for natural compounds that inhibit the activity of
STAT3 using a dual-luciferase assay. Cryptotanshinone was
identified as a potent STAT3 inhibitor. Cryptotanshinone
rapidly inhibited STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation in DU145
prostate cancer cells and the growth of the cells through
96 hours of the treatment. Inhibition of STAT3 Tyr705
phosphorylation in DU145 cells decreased the expression of
STAT3 downstream target proteins such as cyclin D1, survivin,
and Bcl-xL. To investigate the cryptotanshinone inhibitory
mechanism in DU145 cells, we analyzed proteins upstream of
STAT3. Although phosphorylation of Janus-activated kinase
(JAK) 2 was inhibited by 7 Mmol/L cryptotanshinone at
24 hours, inhibition of STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation occurred within 30 minutes and the activity of the other proteins
was not affected. These results suggest that inhibition of STAT3
phosphorylation is caused by a JAK2-independent mechanism,
with suppression of JAK2 phosphorylation as a secondary
effect of cryptotanshinone treatment. Continuing experiments
revealed the possibility that cryptotanshinone might directly
bind to STAT3 molecules. Cryptotanshinone was colocalized
with STAT3 molecules in the cytoplasm and inhibited the
formation of STAT3 dimers. Computational modeling showed
that cryptotanshinone could bind to the SH2 domain of STAT3.
These results suggest that cryptotanshinone is a potent
anticancer agent targeting the activation STAT3 protein. It is
the first report that cryptotanshinone has antitumor activity
through the inhibition of STAT3. [Cancer Res 2009;69(1):193–202]

Introduction
Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)
proteins are a family of seven proteins (STATs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5a, 5b,
and 6) that transduce extracellular signals and regulate transcription of target genes. Among the STATs, STAT3 is the most

antibodies for 3 h. Blots were washed with TBS-T and exposed to HRPconjugated goat-anti-rabbit or goat-anti-mouse IgG for 1 h, and examined
using chemiluminescence POD reagents (Roche Applied Science).
Native gel PAGE. Cell extracts containing native proteins were prepared
using ice-cold isotonic buffer [20 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.0), 150 mmol/L NaCl,
6 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.8 mmol/L PMSF, and 20% glycerol] as described
previously (31). Lysates were homogenized using a 27-gauge syringe and
then cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4jC. Native PAGE
analysis was carried out by loading 10 Ag samples onto 6% SDS-free, PAGE
gels. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore) and
immunoblotted with specific antibody as described for Western blotting.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Nuclear protein extracts were
prepared from DU145 prostate cancer cells as described previously (6).
Briefly, cells were suspended in hypertonic buffer [20 mmol/L HEPES
(pH 7.9), 420 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 20% glycerol,
20 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1 mmol/L Na4P2O7, 1 mmol/L DTT,
0.5 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 Amol/L aprotinin, 1 Amol/L
leupeptin, and 1 Amol/L antipain] and homogenized using a 27-guage
syringe. Nuclear extracts were collected by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for
30 min at 4jC. Protein concentrations were determined using a Protein
Assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Nuclear protein extracts (10 Ag each) were incubated with a biotin-labeled,
double-stranded STAT3 consensus-binding motif: high affinity sis-inducible
element (hSIE; m67 variant) consensus sequence (sense strand; 5¶AGCTTCATTTCCCGTAAATCCCTA-3¶) derived from the c-fos gene promoter. Binding reactions and electrophoresis were carried out using the
LightShift Chemiluminescent electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nylon membranes (Whatman), and cross-linked
for 15 min under a hand-held UV lamp equipped with a 254-nm bulb. Crosslinked, biotin-labeled DNA was detected using the Chemiluminescent
Nucleic Acid Detection Module (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc.).
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses. Cells were trypsinized at
specific times after compound treatment and collected by centrifugation at
300  g for 5 min at room temperature. The supernatant was discarded and
the precipitated cells were washed twice by repeating suspension and
precipitation in PBS buffer. Precipitated cells were carefully suspended in
500 AL PBS buffer and fixed with 4 mL of ice-cold 70% ethanol overnight.
Fixed cells were washed twice with PBS. The collected cells were
resuspended in PBS (5  105 cells/500 AL) and treated with 100 Ag/mL of
RNase A at 37jC for 30 min. Propidium iodide (PI; Sigma) was then added
at a final concentration of 50 Ag/mL for DNA staining, and 20,000 fixed cells
were analyzed on a FACScalibur (Becton Dickinson). Cell cycle distribution
was analyzed using the Modifit program (Becton Dickinson).
Confocal laser microscopy. Coverslips for cell culture were immersed
in 70% ethanol overnight and rinsed with PBS buffer [137 mmol/L NaCl,
2.7 mmol/L KCl, 4.3 mmol/L Na2HPO4, 1.4 mmol/L KH2PO4 (pH 7.4)].
Coverslips were laid in 6-well plates and cells were seeded at a density of
2.5  105 cells per well. After 24 h of treatment, cells were rinsed with PBS
and fixed for 10 min at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde fixative,
followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were blocked
with 1.0% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 1 h and incubated for
3 h at room temperature with p-STAT3Tyr705 or STAT3 antibodies diluted in
PBS containing 1.0% BSA. After washing thrice in PBS buffer, the cells were
incubated with FITC-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Finally, the cells were washed thrice in PBS and treated with
2 Ag/mL of PI in PBS for 5 min to stain chromosomes. Coverslips were
washed in PBS and mounted on glass slides. Cells were observed using a
Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.).
STAT3 knockdown using STAT3 siRNA. The human STAT3 siRNA
duplex and negative control siRNA were purchased from Bioneer, Inc.
The sequences of each siRNA were as follows: negative control (sense,
5¶-CCUACGCCACCAAUUUCGUdTdT-3¶; antisense, 5¶-ACGAAAUUGGUGGCGUAGGdTdT-3¶), STAT3 siRNA-1 (sense, 5¶-UGUUCUCUGAGACCCAUGAdTdT-3¶; antisense, 5¶-UCAUGGGUCUCAGAGAACAdTdT-3¶), and

cells (27, 28). Cryptotanshinone was previously observed to possess
the most powerful antibacterial activity among the tanshinones
that have been tested. It counteracts inflammation through the
inhibition of cyclooxygenase II activity and endothelin-1 expression
(29). However, there have been no reports on the possible
antitumor effect of cryptotanshinone.
In this study, we investigated the mechanism of cryptotanshinone inhibition of STAT3 in tumor cells. Our results provide that
cryptotanshinone selectively inhibits STAT3-activated cell lines
through blocking the dimerization of STAT3.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. RPMI 1640, DMEM, McCoy’s 5A, fetal bovine serum (FBS), and
antibiotic-antimycotic solution were purchased from Life Technologies/

VEGF, and h-actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.
Goat-anti-rabbit and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugates
was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. DMSO
and chemicals used in buffer solutions were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Chemical Co. Cryptotanshinone was isolated from dried roots of Salvia
miltiorrhiza Bunge (Danshen).
Cell culture. Cancer cell lines were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection. A human stomach cell line (KATO III), human prostate
cancer cell lines (DU145, PC3, and LNCaP), and human breast cancer cell
lines (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-453, MCF-7, and MCF-10A)
were maintained in RPMI 1640. HeLa (human cervical adenocarcinoma cell
line) cells were maintained in DMEM. HCT-116 (human colon cancer cell
line) was maintained in McCoy’s 5A. All culture medium was supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. Cell cultures were maintained at 37jC under
a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in an incubator.
Cell proliferation assay. Proliferation assays were performed as
described previously (30). Briefly, cells were seeded at a density of 5,000
cells per well in 96-well plates in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS. Cells were
replenished with fresh complete medium containing either test compounds
or 0.1% DMSO. After incubation for 24 or 48 h, the cell proliferation reagent
WST-1 (Dojindo laboratories) was added to each well. WST-1 formazan was
quantitatively measured at 450 nm using an ELISA reader (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Inc.).
Transient transfection and dual-luciferase assay. HCT-116 cells were
seeded at a density of 10  105 cells in 100 mm2 culture plates. On the
following day, cells were transfected with 27 Ag of 21pSTAT3-TA-Luc and
9 Ag of pRL-TK, a Renilla luciferase control reporter plasmid (Promega)
using TransFectin (Bio-Rad Laboratories). After 5 h of transfection, cells
were trypsinized and seeded onto sterile, black-bottom 96-well plates at a
density of 1  104 cells per well, and then incubated with complete medium
for 24 h. Cells were treated with either test compounds or 0.1% DMSO for
24 h. After treatment, cells were harvested in 20 AL of passive lysis buffer
and luciferase activity was evaluated by the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay
kit (Promega) on Wallac Victor2 (Perkin-Elmer, Inc.). Experiments were
performed in triplicate and repeated three times. Relative luciferase activity
was calculated as according to the formula: relative luciferase activity (%) =
[(normalized luciferase activity of sample treated with a test compound)/
(normalized luciferase activity of sample treated with 0.1% DMSO)]  100.
Western blotting. Cell lysates were prepared by cell incubation in
radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [RIPA; 50 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4),

Cryptotanshinone Inhibits STAT3 Activity through Blocking Dimerization
STAT3 siRNA-2 (sense, 5¶-CUAUCUAAGCCCUAGGUUUdTdT-3¶; antisense,
5¶-AAACCUAGGGCUUAGAUAGdTdT-3¶). Cells were plated at a density of
8  104 cells per well on 6-well plates and transfected with 100 nmol/L of
STAT3-specific and control siRNA duplexes after incubation for 20 min with
Oligofectamine RNAi Max (Invitrogen) in OPTI-MEM (Invitrogen). Five
hours after transfection, siRNA and Oligofectamine mixtures were discarded
and substituted with RPMI 1640 containing 10% serum.

Results
Cryptotanshinone inhibits STAT3-dependent luciferase
activity in HCT-116 colon cancer cells. To identify a novel and
specific inhibitor of STAT3, natural compounds were screened
using a dual-luciferase assay system reflecting STAT3 activity. HCT116 cells were transiently transfected with reporter plasmid having
the STAT3-binding element for regulating luciferase assay.
Cryptotanshinone, isolated from the roots of Salvia miltiorrhiza
Bunge (Danshen), was identified as an inhibitor of STAT3. The
structures of cryptotanshinone and tanshinone IIA, a known
abietane derivative, are shown in Fig. 1A. HCT-116 colon cancer
cells were transiently transfected with reporter plasmids and
treated with cryptotanshinone or tanshinone IIA at a concentration range of 0.2 to 50 Amol/L for 24 hours to confirm a dosedependent inhibition effect. Cryptotanshinone inhibited STAT3
activity in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 value of 4.6
Amol/L (Fig. 1B). However, tanshinone IIA did not inhibit STAT3
activity in STAT3-dependent dual-luciferase assays. Inhibition of
STAT3 activity by cryptotanshinone was also obtained in several
cancer cell lines having activated STAT3 such as MDA-MB-231,
HeLa, and DU145 cell lines (Fig. 1C). These data strongly suggest
that cryptotanshinone specifically inhibits STAT3 activity regardless of cell lines.
Cryptotanshinone inhibits the growth of DU145 cells
harboring constitutively activated STAT3. To determine whether the suppression of STAT3 activity could induce growth
inhibition in cancer cell lines, the expression level and activation
status (STAT3 phosphorylated on Tyr705 and Ser727) of STAT3 was
evaluated in various human cancer cell lines. Among these human
cancer cell lines, the DU145 prostate cancer cell line, MDA-MB-468
breast carcinoma cell line, MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cell line,
and HeLa cervix adenocarcinoma cell line displayed high levels of
activated STAT3 as evidenced by STAT3 Tyr705 and Ser727
phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). It was previously reported that STAT3
knockdown induced the growth inhibition in breast (32) and
prostate (33) cancer cells. Moreover, direct inhibition of constitutively activated STAT3 causes apoptosis in human prostate
carcinoma cell lines (34–36). We next tested whether knockdown
of STAT3 using siRNA induced growth inhibition in cancer cell
lines. STAT3 was silenced by two different STAT3 siRNAs (STAT3
siRNA-1 and STAT3 siRNA-2) in various cancer cell lines
(Supplementary Fig. S1). STAT3 siRNA-2 was introduced into
human cancer cell lines and cell numbers were counted at a
specific times as indicated. The proliferation of DU145 prostate
cancer cells transfected with STAT3 siRNA-2 was dramatically
suppressed after 48 hours. However, STAT3 knockdown in other
cell lines showed only minimal inhibitory effects (Fig. 2B). It
seemed that the growth of DU145 cells was most sensitive to the
silencing of STAT3.
We examined whether the growth inhibition by cryptotanshinone was caused by inhibition of STAT3 activity in breast and
prostate cancer cell lines. Cryptotanshinone showed significant
growth inhibitory effect on the DU145 prostate cancer cell line with

a GI50 value of 7 Amol/L. However, it did not inhibit the growth of
PC3 and LNCaP cells at that concentration (Fig. 2C). Cryptotanshinone also had only a minimal growth inhibitory effect on three
breast carcinoma cell lines. Although STAT3 showed high activity
in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells, cryptotanshinone only
inhibited growth by f32%, even at a concentration of 50 Amol/L.
To test long-term effects of cryptotanshinone on cancer cell
growth, 3 prostate cancer cell lines were treated with cryptotanshinone at a concentration of 7 Amol/L for up to 96 hours. When the
cells was treated with cryptotanshinone, DU145 cell proliferation
but not PC3 and LNCaP proliferation was significantly inhibited
as shown in Fig. 2D. These data show that cryptotanshinone

in various human cancer cell lines were

and STAT3 siRNA-2, and cell number was
counted with heamatocytometer at each
time. HCT-116, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and

silencing. C, proliferation of prostate (top )
and breast (bottom ) cancer cell lines were
measured by WST-1 assay kit at 24 h after
the treatment. D, cells were seeded at a
density of 5,000 cells per well in a 96-well

treated with 0.1% DMSO or 7 Amol/L
cryptotanshinone. WST-1 assay was
carried out after incubation for different
time.

cryptotanshinone for 24 hours, led to a dramatic decrease in
STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation, whereas phosphorylation of STAT3
Ser727 was only mildly decreased at the same concentration
(Fig. 3A). The total amount of STAT3 protein remained unchanged
during this time frame.
To investigate the selectivity and mechanism of STAT3 Tyr705
inhibition by cryptotanshinone, DU145 cells were treated with
7 Amol/L cryptotanshinone. Cell lysates were prepared for
immunoblotting at different time points. The suppression of STAT3
Tyr705 phosphorylation occurred within 30 min (Fig. 3B). However,

selectively inhibits growth of the DU145 prostate cancer cell
line that expresses constitutively active STAT3. DU145 cells were
used for further studies to characterize the mode of action of
cryptotanshinone.
Cryptotanshinone selectively suppresses STAT3 Tyr705
phosphorylation but not through inhibition of upstream
tyrosine kinases. To clarify the mechanism of cryptotanshinone
inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation, the dose- and time-dependent effects of cryptotanshinone were evaluated by Western blot
analyses of STAT family proteins. DU145 cells, treated with

Cryptotanshinone Inhibits STAT3 Activity through Blocking Dimerization

a mechanism that was independent of the IL-6/JAK/STAT3
pathway. These data suggested the possibility that cryptotanshinone might directly and specifically inhibit the phosphorylation of
STAT3 Tyr705.
To determine the effect of cryptotanshinone on other survival
pathways, the activating phosphorylation levels of cytosolic kinases
such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, p38, Akt, PI3K,
and SAPK/JNK was analyzed by Western blot (Supplementary
Fig. S3). Cryptotanshinone had no effect on the phosphorylation of
these kinases.
Cryptotanshinone down-regulates the expression of cyclin
D1, Bcl-xL, and survivin, and causes the accumulation of cells
in G0-G1. Active STAT3 regulates the expression of target proteins
involved in cell survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis through
binding to specific sequences in the promoter region of target
genes (39, 40). We investigated whether the expression of cyclin A
and cyclin D1 (mediating cell cycle progression), Bcl-xL, survivin,
p53 (in relation to its apoptotic properties), and VEGF was affected
by cryptotanshinone treatment. Cryptotanshinone treatment suppressed the expression of cyclin D1, Bcl-xL, and survivin in a dosedependent manner at 24 hours (Fig. 4A). To examine the effects of
down-regulation of these proteins on cell cycle progress, fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis was performed on DU145 cells
treated with different concentrations of cryptotanshinone for
24 hours. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by FACScaliber

the phosphorylation level of other STAT family proteins was not
affected by cryptotanshinone until 4 hours after the treatment.
Because STAT3 Tyr705 is phosphorylated by soluble tyrosine
kinases, various upstream kinases of STAT3 were analyzed in cell
lysates after dose- and time-dependent treatment of cryptotanshinone. JAK family proteins and c-Src had been reported to
activate STAT3 via Tyr705 phosphorylation (37). EGFR has been
reported to be constitutively active in androgen-independent
human prostate cancer cells such as the DU145 cell line (38). It
was recently reported that EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase that
induces the phosphorylation of STAT3 Ser727 through MAPK
phosphorylation in DU145 cells (34). To investigate the mechanisms of inhibition for STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation, the
activation level of upstream kinases, including phosphorylated
JAK family proteins, c-Src, and EGFR were analyzed by Western
blot. JAK2 phosphorylation was inhibited f50% by 5 Amol/L
cryptotanshinone, whereas the activating phosphorylation levels of
the other proteins were not changed by cryptotanshinone (Fig. 3C).
The level of phosphorylated JAK2 was suppressed after 4 hours of
cryptotanshinone treatment in DU145 cells (Fig. 3D). However,
inhibition of JAK2 phosphorylation was a later event than the
inhibition of the STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation as shown in
Fig. 3B and D. Also, phosphorylation of gp130 was not affected by
cryptotanshinone (Supplementary Fig. S2). These results imply that
the inhibition of STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation occurred through

Figure 3. Cryptotanshinone inhibits phosphorylation of STAT3 Tyr705 independent of JAK2 activity. DU145 cells were dose- and time-dependently treated with
cryptotanshinone. Cell lysates were prepared with RIPA lysis buffer. Proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. A, cryptotanshinone inhibited
the phosphorylation of STAT3 Tyr705 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas phosphorylation of Ser727 was mildly inhibited. B, cryptotanshinone suppressed
phosphorylated STAT3 levels within 30 min. DU145 cells were treated with 7 Amol/L cryptotanshinone for the indicated times. C, cryptotanshinone decreased the
phosphorylation of JAK2 protein at the same concentration that suppressed Tyr705 phosphorylation. D, phosphorylation of JAK2 was analyzed in a time-dependent
manner after treatment of cryptotanshinone. Cryptotanshinone did not induce meaningful inhibition of JAK2 phosphorylation.

(Fig. 4B). Cryptotanshinone concentrations over 7 Amol/L caused
DU145 cells to accumulate in the G0-G1 phase. This result could be
attributed to down-regulation of cyclin D1 expression caused by
decreased STAT3 transcriptional regulatory activity. It has been
reported that cyclin D1, which is required for cell cycle progression
from the G1 phase to the S phase, is regulated by STAT3 (41). The
sub-G1 population of cells, interpreted as low DNA content
apoptotic cells, was increased by 10 Amol/L cryptotanshinone.
Cryptotanshinone at dose of 15 Amol/L induced the accumulation
of 52% of cells in sub-G1 or apoptotic cells. As shown in Fig. 4A,
these results may be due to the suppression of Bcl-xL and survivin,
which are responsible for anti-apoptosis signaling.
Cryptotanshinone binds to STAT3 monomer and inhibits
the dimerization of STAT3. To visualize cryptotanshinone
inhibition of STAT3 localization in intact cells, immunofluorescence assays were carried out in HeLa cells using confocal
microscopy. Cells were seeded on coverslips and treated with
cryptotanshinone or tanshinone IIA for 2 hours, and then cells
were fixed, stained, and observed under the microscope. In normal
conditions, STAT3 was mainly located in the nucleus (Fig. 5A, a).
Owing to chemical property of cryptotanshinone or tanshinone IIA
molecules, we could detect its localization inside of cells. No
fluorescence signal was detected in the absence of the cryptotanshinone or tanshinone IIA (Fig. 5A, b). To detect the change in
localization of STAT3, cells were treated with cryptotanshinone or
tanshinone IIA for 2 hours. Tanshinone IIA, used as a negative
control, did not show meaningful change in localization of STAT3
as well as the total amount of STAT3 (Fig. 5A, e). Also, tanshinone
IIA was ubiquitously located in the cytoplasm and nucleus
independent of the location of STAT3 (Fig. 5A, f ). However, STAT3
molecules were mainly located in the cytoplasm after treatment
with cryptotanshinone, implying that cryptotanshinone inhibits the
translocation of STAT3 into the nucleus (Fig. 5A, i). Moreover,
cryptotanshinone was mainly located in the cytoplasm along with
the STAT3 molecule but not in the nucleus (Fig. 5A, j). Differences

in distribution between tanshinone IIA and cryptotanshinone are
clearly shown in red circles indicating the nucleus.
HeLa cells were stained for phosphorylated STAT3Tyr705 to
confirm that cryptotanshinone inhibits STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation. In the growing condition, phosphorylated STAT3Tyr705
molecules were concentrated in the nucleus (Fig. 5B, a). Treating
cells with tanshinone IIA did not diminish phosphorylated
STAT3Tyr705 in the nucleus (Fig. 5B, e). However, cryptotanshinone
dramatically decreased STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation (Fig. 5B, i).
Tanshinone IIA was detected in the cytoplasm as well as in the
nucleus (Fig. 5B, f ). However, cryptotanshinone was only located
in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus (Fig. 5B, j). These data
implies that cryptotanshinone directly binds to STAT3 molecules
in the cytoplasm and thus inhibit Tyr705 phosphorylation,
preventing STAT3 molecules from being translocated into the
nucleus.
Because STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation is related with STAT3
dimerization, we analyzed whether cryptotanshinone inhibited
STAT3 dimerization by using native PAGE. As shown in Fig. 5C,
Cryptotanshinone decreased the amounts of dimerized STAT3 in
DU145 cells in a time-dependent manner. Six hours after
cryptotanshinone treatment, dimerized STAT3 was significantly
decreased.
Dimerized STAT3 is an active form that has the ability to bind to
cis-acting sequences in the promoters of target genes (42).
Therefore, we further confirmed that cryptotanshinone decrease
STAT3 dimers using an EMSA assay. For this, we treated DU145
cells with cryptotanshinone for different times and lysates were
prepared. As shown in Fig. 5D, DNA binding activity of STAT3 was
decreased after 3-hour treatment and almost completely lost after
6-hour treatment. These data suggest that cryptotanshinone binds
to STAT3 monomers, blocking dimerization, and inhibiting STAT3
transcriptional regulatory activity.
Cryptotanshinone binds to the SH2 domain of STAT3. STAT3
dimerization is known to occur through the interaction of the SH2

G0-G1 and apoptosis of DU145 cells.

were transferred to a PVDF membrane and then immunoblotted (IB ) with a STAT3 monoclonal antibody. Detailed descriptions of procedures are described in
Materials and Methods. D, activity of STAT3 from DU145 cells treated with cryptotanshinone for different times was examined by EMSA assay using a hSIE probe.

To test whether cryptotanshinone can bind to the STAT3 SH2
domain, computational modeling was performed. The crystal
structure of STAT3 at 2.25-Å resolution (43) was obtained from the
Protein Data Bank (PDB ID code 1BG1) and used for this modeling.
The results of this modeling approach indicated that cryptotanshinone could possibly bind to the SH2 domain of STAT3 (Fig. 6A).
The mode of cryptotanshinone binding to STAT3 was predicted
using the AutoDock 1.0 program (47) and the image of the
predicted interaction was processed with the graphic program
PyMOL. The refined model predicted that cryptotanshinone binds

domain on one STAT3 molecule with a loop segment ( from Ala702
to Phe716) on the other STAT3 monomer (43, 44). The
phosphorylated Tyr705 on one STAT3 molecule is a critical residue
for binding to a cavity on the SH2 domain of the other STAT3
protein. Because of this reason, researchers have developed STAT3
inhibitors targeting the SH2 domain and evaluated their activity in
cancer cells. In previous reports, structure-based virtual screening
had been used to identify candidate compounds that can disrupt
STAT3 dimerization (45, 46). The SH2 domain structure was used
for virtual screening of small molecules.

cell lines. DU145 cells showed the greatest sensitively to
cryptotanshinone inhibition. In DU145 cells, cryptotanshinone
strongly inhibited phosphorylation of STAT3 Tyr705 but had only a
small effect on STAT3 Ser727 at 7 Amol/L (Fig. 3A). Interestingly,
effects on tyrosine residue phosphorylation were only observed for
STAT3 and not STAT1 or STAT5 within 30 min (Fig. 3B). These data
suggest that cryptotanshinone specifically blocks the phosphorylation of STAT3 Tyr705.
To investigate the mechanism of cryptotanshinone-induced
STAT3 inhibitory effects in DU145 cells, we analyzed the activation
of upstream proteins such as JAK family proteins and Src. The IL-6/
gp130/JAK signaling pathway is well-established as a signaling
pathway that phosphorylates STAT3 Tyr705 in human fibrosarcoma cells (2), breast cancer cell (5), and myeloid cell (48). As shown
in Fig. 3C, only phosphorylation of JAK2 was suppressed by
treatment with 7 Amol/L cryptotanshinone. However, it was likely
that the inhibition of STAT3 Tyr705 was not due to inhibition of
JAK2 activity because the inhibition of JAK2 phosphorylation
occurred 4 hours after the treatment, whereas STAT3 phosphorylation was inhibited within 30 minutes after the treatment
(Fig. 3D). These results suggest that inhibition of STAT3 Tyr705
phosphorylation by cryptotanshinone is not due to proteins related
to the JAK/STAT pathway. Also, activity of various cytosolic kinases
responsible for cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and cell division
were not affected after the cryptotanshinone treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3). These results strongly support the possibility that
the growth inhibition of DU145 cells is due to STAT3 inactivation
through an unknown pathway.
It was possible that the antitumor effects of cryptotanshinone
might be mediated by suppressing the expression of STAT3regulated target genes such as cyclin D1, survivin, and Bcl-xL.

at the specific site where the Tyr705 residue interacts within the
SH2 domain (Fig. 6B). The model also predicted that cryptotanshinone forms a number of hydrogen bonds with nearby amino
acid residues, including Arg609 and Ile634 (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
In this study, primary screening with a dual-luciferase assay was
used for identification of STAT3 inhibitors. We selected cryptotanshinone as a small-molecule inhibitor of STAT3 transcriptional
regulatory activity. It was previously reported that cryptotanshinone, together with tanshinone IIA, is one of major active
components of the traditional medicinal ingredient Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (Danshen). Tanshinone IIA was excluded in this study
because it did not show inhibitory activity in the luciferase assay
(Fig. 1B and C). Therefore, we decided to characterize the
mechanism of action of cryptotanshinone inhibition of STAT3
activity.
It was previously reported that knockdown of STAT3 induces
apoptosis in human prostate cancer cell lines (33, 36). In this study,
we confirmed that knockdown of STAT3 inhibits the proliferation
of prostate cancer cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, knockdown of STAT3
protein by STAT3 siRNA caused cancer cell growth inhibition,
although the efficiency of inhibition was different depending on the
cell type. In particular, growth of DU145 prostate cancer cells was
inhibited >60% by treatment with STAT3 siRNA. Therefore, DU145
cell was selected for the mechanism studies of STAT3 inhibitors.
Next, we tested cryptotanshinone growth inhibition effect in
prostate and breast cancer cell lines harboring different levels of
STAT3 activity. As shown in Fig. 3C, the inhibitory effect was
dependent on the STAT3 activation status in three prostate cancer

monomer and the SH2 domain of the other STAT3. Therefore,
the SH2 domain had been regarded as a target site of for the
development of STAT3 inhibitors and small-molecules that bind to
the SH2 domain have been virtually screened (45, 46). We are
proposing that destabilization of STAT3 dimers could be induced
by the direct binding of cryptotanshinone to the SH2 domain of
STAT3.
This is the first report of cryptotanshinone as a novel inhibitor of
STAT3 signaling. Cryptotanshinone specifically suppressed STAT3
signaling and not other proteins in the STAT family. Moreover,
cryptotanshinone did not down-regulate STAT3 protein expression,
even at the highest concentrations tested. It has been reported that
curcumin, an inhibitor of the STAT pathway, decreased STAT3
expression itself after 24 hours of treatment (50). However, in the
present investigations, STAT3 expression did not decrease in
DU145 cells after cryptotanshinone treatment. These results
suggest that cryptotanshinone is a more specific STAT3 inhibitor
than previously reported small molecules, without general
cytotoxic effects.

Down-regulation of these proteins inhibited cell cycle progression
and led to inhibition of cell growth. STAT3 phosphorylation plays a
critical role in the proliferation of tumor cells (39). The downregulation of cyclin D1 expression by cryptotanshinone was
correlated with accumulation of cells in the G1 phase of the cell
cycle. Also, the suppression of Bcl-xL expression by cryptotanshinone seemed to induce cell death (Fig. 4B). It has been reported
that Bcl-xL can also block cell death induced by a variety of
chemotherapeutic agents in parallel with an increase in chemoresistance (49). The down-regulation of the Bcl-xL and survivin is
likely linked with the ability of cryptotanshinone to induce cell
death in DU145 cells.
The localization experiments with confocal microscopy
implied that cryptotanshinone might bind to STAT3 molecules
directly. Weak cryptotanshinone fluorescence at 470 nm by
excitation at 350 nm was used for localization of cryptotanshinone within the cells. When cells were treated with
cryptotanshinone, most of STAT3 was localized in the cytoplasm
such as cryptotanshinone. This colocalization of cryptotanshinone with STAT3 implied that cryptotanshinone bind directly to
STAT3 (Fig. 5A and B). Using computational modeling, we found
that cryptotanshinone may directly bind to the SH2 domain of
STAT3. Computational modeling also showed the mode of
interaction through which cryptotanshinone interacts with
Arg609 and Ile634 residues in STAT3 (Fig. 6B). From these
examinations, it seems that interaction at the SH2 pocket of
STAT3 allows cryptotanshinone to inhibit the phosphorylation
and dimerization of STAT3.
Other investigators have reported by computational modeling
that STAT3 dimerization is achieved through an interaction
between the phosphorylated Tyr705 residue of one STAT3
