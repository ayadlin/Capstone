Abstract
Resistance to chemotherapy remains a major barrier to the
successful treatment of cancer. To understand mechanisms
underlying docetaxel resistance in breast cancer, we used an
insertional mutagenesis strategy to identify proteins whose
overexpression confers resistance. A strong promoter was
inserted approximately randomly into the genomes of tumorderived breast cancer cells, using a novel lentiviral vector. We
isolated a docetaxel-resistant clone in which the level of the
kinesin KIFC3 was elevated. When KIFC3 or the additional
kinesins KIFC1, KIF1A, or KIF5A were overexpressed in the
breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB231 and MDA-MB 468, the cells
became more resistant to docetaxel. The binding of kinesins to
microtubules opposes the stabilizing effect of docetaxel that
prevents cytokinesis and leads to apoptosis. Our finding that
kinesins can mediate docetaxel resistance might lead to novel
therapeutic approaches in which kinesin inhibitors are paired
with taxanes. [Cancer Res 2009;69(20):8035–42]

Introduction
Systemic chemotherapy of breast cancer has improved over the
past few decades with the introduction of new drugs, and the
optimization of numerous combination regimens (1). An important
advance has been the use of docetaxel and paclitaxel, which bind to
the h-tubulin subunits of microtubules, inhibiting the rate of
exchange of free and bound tubulin (2). This inhibition disrupts
mitotic spindle formation, inhibiting cell division and leading to
cell death (3). Although up to half of the patients treated with
docetaxel achieve a clinical response, their tumors may develop
resistance subsequently (3). Several different mechanisms account
for the taxane resistance observed in human tumors and tumor
cell lines, including overexpression of the multidrug transporter
P-glycoprotein (4), altered metabolism of the taxane, decreased
sensitivity to death-inducing stimuli (5), alterations in microtubule
dynamics, and altered binding of the taxane to its microtubule
target (6, 7). Candidate proteins that might mediate taxane
resistance through their inclusion in microtubules or their
association with these structures include hIII-tubulin (2), the
microtubule-associated proteins MAP4 and Tau, and the microtubule-destabilizing phosphoprotein Stathmin (8, 9). Analysis of the
levels of these proteins might be clinically useful in predicting
responses to taxanes, but none have proven to be specific targets
for increasing the efficacy of taxane-based therapy in breast cancer.

Our laboratory has developed a novel method, called VBIM, for
validation-based insertional mutagenesis, for inserting strong
cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoters approximately randomly into
the genomes of mammalian cells in tissue culture. In principle, the
method is capable of identifying any protein or RNA whose
overexpression in a mutant cell line confers a selectable phenotype
(10). The inserted promoter can be removed or silenced at will, to
prove that its function is responsible for the altered phenotype. We
used the VBIM method to make the novel discovery that
overexpression of the kinesin KIFC3 confers resistance to docetaxel
in breast cancer cell lines.
The kinesin motor proteins, found in all cells, attach to
microtubules and move along them to transport cellular cargoes.
Kinesins are also key participants in chromosomal and spindle
movements during mitosis and meiosis (11, 12). They typically
include two large globular heads that attach to microtubules, a
central coiled region, and a light-chain region that connects the
kinesin to the intracellular component to be moved (13). The 45
murine and human kinesin genes have been classified into three
major types, based on the positions of their motor domains: aminoterminal (N), middle (M), and carboxy-terminal (C; ref. 14). There
are 39 N-kinesins, three M-kinesins, and three C-kinesins, KIFC1,
KIFC2, and KIFC3 (14). KIFC1 (15) is expressed primarily in
proliferating tissues and cell lines, and KIFC2 (15, 16) is expressed
specifically in neural tissues. In contrast, KIFC3 is apparently
ubiquitous (14, 17). KIFC3 has minus end–directed microtubule
motor activity and functions in Golgi positioning and integration
(18) and also in apical transport in epithelial cells (19). Studies of
null mice revealed that KIFC3 is dispensable for normal
development and reproduction (17).
In addition to KIFC3, we find that overexpression of a second
COOH-terminal kinesin, KIFC1, or of the NH2-terminal kinesins
KIF5A and KIF1A, all mediate the resistance of breast cancer cells
to docetaxel. These findings suggest that different types of kinesins,
probably including some of the 41 family members not tested in
our study, might also function as mediators of docetaxel resistance
in cancer.

pBabePuro vector. To construct KIFC3 cDNA, total RNA was isolated from
mutant cells by using a Qiagen kit according to the protocol provided by the
manufacturer. Reverse transcription was performed using oligo DT20 primers
with the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System kit and protocol
(Invitrogen). Standard PCR reactions were performed by using a forward
primer from the VBIM vector and a KIFC3-specific reverse primer with a stop
codon. The PCR product was cloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen). The
DNA was digested with EcoR1 and recloned into the retroviral vector pLPCX.
KIFC1, KIF5A, and KIF1A were also recloned into the pLPCX vector.
Lentiviral and retroviral transduction. Lentiviruses were produced by
transient transfection of 293T cells with the plasmids pVBIM-SD1, pVBIMSD2, and pVBIM-SD3 along with a second-generation packaging construct
(pCMV-dR8.74) and pMD2G both provided by D. Trono, University of
Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland (21).
Generation of a VBIM-mutated cell library and selection of
docetaxel resistant clones. MDA-MB 231 cells were plated at 10,000 cells
per well in 48-well plates and infected with pVBIM SD1, SD2, and SD3
(20 pools for each), with 12 pools left uninfected. The cells were grown for
2 d and plated in six-well plates. When the cells attained 80% confluency,
300,000 cells were replated in each well of six-well plates and allowed to
attach overnight. The cells were treated with 10 nmol/L docetaxel and kept
under selection for 24 h.
Validation of docetaxel-resistant clones. Colonies surviving in
docetaxel were expanded and infected with the retroviral vectors pBabe

puro or pBabe Cre recombinase. The cells were selected with puromycin for
2 wk to generate stable pools. The Cre and vector control cells were plated
at 300,000 cells per well in six-well plates and treated with docetaxel (10 or
12 nmol/L) for 24 h. After 1 week, the cells were stained with methylene blue.
Mapping the inserts and detection of overexpressed molecules. To
identify insertion sites, inverse PCR was performed with EcoR1- and Mfe1digested genomic DNA from mutant clone SD1.10, which was circularized
by self-ligation and subjected to nested PCR (10). The PCR product was
cloned into pCR2.1, sequenced, and aligned to the human genome database.
The insertion in the KIFC3 gene was confirmed by reverse transcriptionPCR (RT-PCR), using the vector-derived forward primer and a KIFC3derived reverse primer. Western analysis was performed using anti-KIFC3.
Cell survival assay. Cells (300,000) were plated in each well of six-well
plates, allowed to attach overnight, and treated with docetaxel or vincristine
for 24 h. After 7 to 10 d, the cells were lysed with 0.5 mol/L NaOH and
diluted 50-fold before the A260 was measured, as an indication of the total
amount of nucleic acid. The fraction of surviving cells was calculated
relative to untreated controls.
Immunoblotting and mRNA expression. Western analyses were
performed as described before (21). The membranes were probed with
antibodies against KIFC3, KIFC1, and KIF5A or anti–pan-actin, followed by
incubation with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody-horseradish
peroxidase conjugates (Hoffman-La Roche). Chemiluminescence was developed by using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Perkin-Elmer). To

mutagenesis viruses and selected in docetaxel (Doce ). The docetaxel-resistant mutant clone SD1.10 was infected with control vector (pBabePuro) or with a
vector encoding Cre recombinase. The cells remaining after docetaxel treatment were stained with methylene blue. B, to identify the responsible gene, a PCR fragment
from mutant SD1.10 was cloned, sequenced, and aligned to the human genome database. The insertion maps to the KIFC3 gene, and the VBIM integration was
in the third intron of this gene, in the sense direction. C, overexpression of KIFC3 mRNA in SD 1.10 mutant cells. RT-PCR was performed with RNAs from parental cells,
the SD1.10 mutant infected with control vector, and SD1.10 cells expressing Cre. Overexpression of KIFC3 mRNA was observed in the mutant at an early (22nd)
PCR cycle, and this expression was completely reversed by Cre. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH ) was used as a control. D, overexpression of
the KIFC3 protein in SD1.10 cells. Western analysis was performed with anti-KIFC3 antibody. Anti–pan-actin was used as a loading control. Two independent
experiments gave very similar results.

Docetaxel Resistance Due to Kinesin Overexpression

Figure 2. KIFC3 is responsible for docetaxel resistance. A, KIFC3 cDNA was used to infect naı̈ve MDA-MB 231 cells and the level of expression was determined by
Western analysis, using total cell lysates. Anti–pan-actin was used as a control. The experiment was repeated twice with very similar results. B, survival of cells expressing
KIFC3 or empty vector, with or without docetaxel treatment. The cells were lysed with 0.5 mol/L NaOH and A260 was measured as an indication of the total amount

determine the mRNA expression level, total cellular RNA was extracted using
a Qiagen kit. The RT reaction was performed using the SuperScript III FirstStrand Synthesis System, and PCR was done using KIF1A-specific primers.
Measurement of free or polymerized tubulin. Cells were plated in
60-mm plates (40  104 cells/plate) and allowed to attach overnight. The
cells were treated with docetaxel for 24 h or left untreated. After 2 d, free or
polymerized tubulin was extracted, using a standard protocol (22). Briefly,
the cells were washed with PBS at 37jC, and then with 1 mL of Buffer A
[containing 0.1 mol/L MES (pH 6.75), 1 mmol/L MgSO4, 2 mmol/L EGTA,
0.1 mmol/L EDTA, and 4 mol/L glycerol], which prevents microtubule
depolymerization. The soluble proteins were then extracted at 37jC for
5 min in a buffer (Buffer A plus 0.1% v/v Triton X-100 and protease
inhibitors) and the extracts were centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 rpm. The
pellet fraction and lysed cells in the culture dish were dissolved in a buffer
containing 25 mmol/L Tris (pH 6.8), plus 0.5% SDS. Total proteins from the
free or polymerized tubulin fractions were analyzed by the Western method,
with anti–a-tubulin. The intensity of each band was measured by using NIH
software (image J) and the percentages of free and polymerized tubulin in
each cell extract were quantified.
Apoptosis assay. Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry, using the
Annexin V FITC Apoptosis Detection kit (Calbiochem) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.
Analysis of gene expression in breast cancers. The ‘‘Cel’’ files for
Affymetrix Hg U95-A v2 arrays used by Chang and colleagues (ref. 23; series
GSE349 and GSE350) were downloaded from the National Center for
Bioinformatics Information’s auxiliary Web site Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO)4, and the signals were analyzed by the Gene Expression and
Genotyping Facility of the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case
Western Reserve University, Cleveland Ohio, using Affymetrix proprietary
software, Gene Chip Operating Software. All samples were scaled to 500 in
accordance with the recommendations of the vendor (Affymetrix). Signal
data were exported as excel spreadsheets and sorted into resistant and

sensitive groups. Gene probe set identifiers and annotations for members of
the family of kinesin genes were found in the Affymetrix Netaffx Analysis
Center5 and exported as tab delimited text. These identifiers were
associated with the respective signal profile records found in the Affymetrix
results, using MS Access database manager. Gross profiles were then
inspected to see if there were any consistent differences in expression of
members of the kinesin family of genes between docetaxel-resistant and
-sensitive samples.
Statistical analysis. Values were expressed as means F SD. P values
were based on the paired t test and the significance was set at 0.05 (marked
with an asterisk wherever data are statistically significant).

Results
Isolation of a docetaxel-resistant clone. Using three varieties
of VBIM lentiviral vectors, intended to allow expression in all three
reading frames (10), we inserted the strong CMV promoter
approximately randomly into the genomes of docetaxel-sensitive,
estrogen receptor–negative MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells. A
total of 60 pools (10,000 virally infected cells per pool; 20 each with
pVBIM SD1, SD2, and SD3) were selected with 10 nmol/L docetaxel.
After selection, 8 of the 60 pools yielded resistant colonies; there
were no colonies in 12 pools of uninfected control cells. Cells from
each positive pool were infected with a lentivirus encoding Cre or
with the control pBabePuro virus, treated with docetaxel and
grown to test for reversion. Clone SD1.10 was validated in this way
(Fig. 1A) but the other seven clones were not validated, showing
that their resistance was not caused by promoter-driven events.
Identification of KIFC3 as the gene responsible for docetaxel
resistance. A PCR fragment from mutant SD1.10 was cloned and

Figure 3. Increased expression of kinesins KIFC1, KIF5A, or KIF1A increases

performed as in Fig. 2B in cells infected with empty vector or with retroviruses
encoding KIFC1, KIF5A, or KIF1A, after treatment with docetaxel. The fraction of

sequenced. The insertion maps to the KIFC3 gene, located on
human chromosome 16q13-q21. The full coding sequence of 2,061
bp of KIFC3 translates to 687 amino acids (24). The insertion in
SD1.10 mapped to the third intron of the gene (Fig. 1B). Hoang and
colleagues (24) showed that the translational start site is within exon
5, and therefore, the viral integration in the third intron leads to the
overexpression of the complete coding sequence of KIFC3. Using a
5¶ VBIM-specific primer and a 3¶ gene-specific primer, analysis by
RT-PCR showed the overexpression of the VBIM-specific KIFC3
mRNA in mutant SD1.10 and Cre recombinase eliminated this
expression (Fig. 1C). The level of KIFC3 protein was significantly
higher in mutant SD1.10 than in parental cells (Fig. 1D). These

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (20). October 15, 2009

results indicate that the overexpression of full-length KIFC3 protein
is responsible for the mutant phenotype of SD1.10 cells.
High expression of KIFC3 increases resistance to docetaxel
in naı̈ve cells. To confirm KIFC3 as a mediator of docetaxel
resistance, a full-length KIFC3 cDNA was introduced into
unmutagenized, MDA-MB 231 cells, resulting in stable pools of
cells in which the KIFC3 protein is overexpressed (Fig. 2A). We
noted two bands in western analyses of KIFC3 protein (Fig. 2A and
C), perhaps due to posttranslational modifications. These cells
were significantly more resistant to 4 or 6 nmol/L docetaxel than
were the controls (Fig. 2B). The mixed population of cells
expressing KIFC3 contains individual cells with different levels of
expression, causing some cells in the population to be more
resistant than others. We isolated individual clones with different
levels of KIFC3 (Fig. 2C) and analyzed their resistance to docetaxel
(Fig. 2D). Clones K1 and K3, which have substantially higher levels
of KIFC3 protein than clone K2, were correspondingly more
resistant to docetaxel. These results confirm the role of KIFC3 in
docetaxel resistance in MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells in vitro
and also show that the level of KIFC3 protein correlates with the
level of resistance.
Overexpression of KIFC1, KIF1A, or KIF5A increases
resistance to docetaxel. In a previous study (23), core biopsy
samples were taken from 24 primary breast tumors before
treatment and the response of the tumors to neoadjuvant docetaxel
was assessed by analysis of RNA extracted from biopsy samples. We
used the Cel files for these Affymetrix Hg U95-Av2 arrays (series
GSE349 and GSE350), from the National Center for Bioinformatics
Information’s auxiliary Web site GEO4 to analyze the signals. In
these data, kinesins KIFC1, KIF1A, and KIF5A were slightly
overexpressed in docetaxel-resistant tumor samples, suggesting
that these kinesins might have a role in mediating resistance in vivo.
Therefore, we determined whether KIFC1, KIF5A, and KIF1A could
mediate docetaxel resistance in our in vitro system, by generating
stable MDA-MB 231 cell lines expressing them (Fig. 3). Upon
exposure to 4 or 6 nmol/L docetaxel, there was a significant increase
in the percentage of surviving KIFC1-expressing cells compared
with control cells infected with vector alone (Fig. 3A). Increased cell
survival was also observed in cells expressing KIF5A (Fig. 3B) and
KIF1A (Fig. 3C). We used the same approach with another estrogen
receptor–negative breast carcinoma cell line, MDA-MB 468,
creating cell pools overexpressing the four kinesins (Fig. 4) and
analyzing the resistance to docetaxel. Cell survival was significantly
higher in KIFC3 overexpressing cells compared with vector control
cells (Fig. 4A), showing that the effect of KIFC3 in docetaxel
resistance is not restricted to a single cell type. Similarly, we created
MDA-MB 468 cells overexpressing the other three kinesins. Upon
treatment with docetaxel, cells expressing KIFC1 (Fig. 4B), KIF5A
(Fig. 4C), or KIF1A (Fig. 4D) survived much better than control cells,
indicating that four different kinesins can mediate docetaxel
resistance in two different breast cancer cell lines.
Kinesins KIFC3, KIFC1, and KIF5A oppose the microtubulestabilizing effect of docetaxel. Taxanes stabilize microtubules,
thereby inhibiting cell processes that depend upon microtubule
dynamics (25). To learn more about how KIFC3 confers resistance
to docetaxel, we determined whether it affects microtubules by
measuring the amounts of free tubulin in MDA-MB 231 cells
overexpressing this kinesin, with or without docetaxel treatment.
In response to 4 nmol/L docetaxel, the amount of free tubulin was
substantially decreased in a pool of cells infected with empty vector
(Fig. 5A), and at 6 nmol/L docetaxel, no free tubulin was detected.

Docetaxel Resistance Due to Kinesin Overexpression

However, in a pool of cells expressing KIFC3, the amount of free
tubulin was decreased much less. Therefore, KIFC3 expression
opposes the stabilization of microtubules that results from
docetaxel treatment. In addition to KIFC3, we also observed a
substantial increase in the level of free tubulin in MDA-MB 231
cells overexpressing KIFC1 (Fig. 5B) or KIF5A (Fig. 5C), compared
with the controls, upon docetaxel treatment. However, treatment
with docetaxel had no effect on free tubulin pools in cells
expressing KIF1A (Fig. 5D). These results suggest that kinesins
KIFC3, KIFC1, and KIF5A oppose the microtubule-stabilizing effect
of docetaxel. However, KIF1A increases resistance to docetaxel by a
different mechanism, which may also be used by the other kinesins
(see the Discussion).
KIFC3 inhibits docetaxel-mediated apoptosis. Because
taxane-mediated disruption of microtubules ultimately drives cells
to apoptosis, we examined whether KIFC3 expression affects
apoptosis in response to docetaxel in breast cancer cells. Pools of
MDA-MB 231 cells overexpressing KIFC3, or control cells, were
exposed to different concentrations of docetaxel for 24 hours, and
after 8 days, an apoptosis assay was performed. After exposure to
docetaxel, the percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly higher
in control cells than in cells expressing KIFC3 (Fig. 6A).
Microtubule depolymerization contributes to docetaxel
resistance in breast cancer cells. Free tubulin levels were

substantially higher in MDA-MB 231 and MDA-MB 468 cells
compared with MCF7 and T47D cells (Fig. 6B). Cell survival assays
were performed to determine whether increased levels of
endogenous microtubule depolymerization correlate with docetaxel resistance. Consistently, survival was greater in MDA-MB
231 and MDA MB 468 cells by 2.5- to 3-fold, compared with MCF7
and T47D cells, following treatment with 3 or 4 nmol/L docetaxel
(Fig. 6C). Furthermore, when cells were exposed to the microtubule
depolymerizing Vinca alkaloid Vincristine (Fig. 6D), we observed
increased resistance in cells with elevated polymerized tubulin
(MCF7 and T47D), compared with those with elevated free tubulin
(MDA-MB 231 and MDA-MB 468). These results suggest that the
relative levels of free and microtubule-bound tubulin may be useful
as markers of docetaxel resistance and vincristine sensitivity in
breast cancer.

Discussion
In cancer cells, resistance to chemotherapy is often due to the
overexpression of a specific protein, often achieved through
amplification of the corresponding gene. Earlier reports described
several different function-based screens to discover cellular genes
whose inactivation or overexpression yielded phenotypes of
interest (26–28). We developed a novel validation-based insertional

treated with docetaxel for 24 h. After 2 d, free and polymerized (Pol ) tubulin was extracted and Western analysis was performed with anti–a-tubulin. The percentages of
free and polymerized tubulin in each cell extract were quantified. All of the experiments above were repeated twice, with very similar results. B, C, and D, cells

mutagenesis method to generate mutant cells lines through the
overexpression of a protein due to promoter insertion (10).
Here, we have used this method to discover that the overexpression
of the kinesin KIFC3 confers resistance to docetaxel in breast
cancer cells. Several studies show that the cellular target of taxanes
is h-tubulin within microtubules (29), and taxane resistance is
thought to involve alterations in microtubule structure and/or
function (30). Our discovery that overexpression of the kinesin
KIFC3 mediates resistance to docetaxel in breast cancer cells
represents a previously unknown mechanism. Overexpression of
KIFC3 increases the survival of two estrogen receptor–negative
metastatic breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB 231, and MDA-MB
468, upon treatment with docetaxel. We analyzed these particular
cell lines because docetaxel is used to treat estrogen receptor–
negative breast cancer patients (25, 31).
Several studies (23, 32, 33) have used microarrays to study drugresistance mechanisms in breast cancer. Chang and colleagues (23)
analyzed gene expression in core biopsy samples of primary breast
cancers taken from patients resistant (>25% residual tumor

volume) or sensitive (<25% residual tumor volume) to docetaxel
treatment. There were two probe sets for KIFC3 gene on the
affymetrix Hg U95-Av2 chip. One probe set showed a very slight
increase (1.2-fold) in docetaxel-resistant compared with docetaxelsensitive tumors and the other showed a decrease of similar
magnitude (0.8-fold). We noted that the kinesins KIFC1, KIF1A, and
KIF5A were slightly overexpressed in docetaxel-resistant tumors
compared with docetaxel-sensitive tumors, and thus, we investigated the possible role of these three kinesins in docetaxel
resistance in breast cancer cell lines, finding that overexpression of
these kinesins indeed does mediate docetaxel resistance in breast
cancer cell lines. KIFC1, a minus end–directed, microtubuledependent molecular motor, is required for bipolar spindle
formation. It is very similar to the kinesins ncd and kar 3, and is
reported to be involved in mitosis (34). KIF1A is an anterograde
motor protein that transports membranous organelles along
axonal microtubules. It may play a critical role in the development
of axonal neuropathies resulting from impaired axonal transport
(13). A recent study showed that KIF1A is up-regulated in

Docetaxel Resistance Due to Kinesin Overexpression

endometrial cancer (35). KIF5A is expressed in nerve tissues (36)
and transports vesicles and membranous organelles (37). KIF5A
and KIF1A are not expressed detectably in the cell lines we have
analyzed but might be expressed ectopically in specific breast
cancers due, for example, to gene amplification.
Microtubules are dynamic structures with lengths that are tightly
regulated. KinI or M-kinesins (38, 39) stimulate microtubule
depolymerization in an ATP-dependent fashion (40, 41). The Kin
I kinesin HsMCAK (KNSL6) is overexpressed in human cancers (42,
43) and the hamster homologue can depolymerize paclitaxelstabilized microtubules (44). We have found that overexpression of
KIFC3, KIFC1, or KIF5A increase the pools of free tubulin in breast
cancer cells treated with docetaxel, suggesting that these kinesins
may antagonize the effect of docetaxel at least in part by promoting
the dissociation of tubulin from microtubules. This result supports
the previous deduction that the expression of endogenous
microtubule depolymerizing factors might favor the development
of Taxol resistance (45). Our failure to observe microtubule
depolymerizing activity in cells overexpressing KIF1A is consistent
with the previous finding by Ogawa and colleagues (46) that KIF1A
does not have this activity. It is likely that KIF1A opposes the
inhibition of tubulin-microtubule association-dissociation kinetics
that is caused by docetaxel rather than affecting the equilibrium
between free and microtubule-bound tubulin (2), and the other
kinesins are likely to have the same effect. Kinetic measurements

are needed to establish this point clearly. Inhibition of microtubule
dynamics by Taxol induces persistent modification of biological
processes and signaling pathways, which ultimately lead to cell
death through the accumulation of signals that finally reach the
threshold for the onset of apoptosis (29).
The breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB 231 and MDA-MB 468,
with higher levels of free tubulin, showed increased resistance
when challenged with docetaxel compared with MCF7 and T47D
cells, which have lower levels. Furthermore, opposite effects were
noticed when the cells were exposed to vincristine, which is a
clinically used microtubule-destabilizing agent. These results are
supported by the previous findings that increased levels of
polymerized tubulin is associated with increased microtubule
stability, decreased sensitivity to microtubule-depolymerizing
drugs such as the Vinca alkaloids, and increased sensitivity
to the microtubule-polymerizing drug Taxol (47). Therefore,
the level of microtubule depolymerization in tumors may be
a predictive factor for clinical response to taxane-based
chemotherapy.
In conclusion, we have shown that overexpression of four
different kinesins can mediate docetaxel resistance in breast cancer
cell lines and have determined that three of them increase the
fraction of soluble tubulin in cells. Resistance to docetaxel is a
complex phenomenon that can be orchestrated by a number of
different mechanisms. Our increased understanding of the full

range of mechanisms contributing to taxane resistance will
hopefully enable the development of therapies tailored to the
needs of individual patients. In particular, it will be important to
assess the association of kinesin overexpression in breast cancer
specimens as a function of progression-free survival in patients
treated with a docetaxel-containing regimen, with the goal of
developing kinesins as new prognostic and diagnostic marker.
Eventually, it may be possible to develop inhibitors of any kinesins
that are responsible for taxane resistance in tumors, with the hope
that such inhibitors may synergize with taxanes by interfering with
the resistance mechanism. Inhibitors of some kinesins are already
known (48).
