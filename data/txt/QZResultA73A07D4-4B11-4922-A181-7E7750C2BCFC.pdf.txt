Abstract
TRAP1, a mitochondrial chaperone (Hsp75) with antioxidant and antiapoptotic functions, is involved in
multidrug resistance in human colorectal carcinoma cells. Through a proteomic analysis of TRAP1 coimmunoprecipitation complexes, the Ca2+-binding protein Sorcin was identified as a new TRAP1 interactor. This
result prompted us to investigate the presence and role of Sorcin in mitochondria from human colon carcinoma cells. Using fluorescence microscopy and Western blot analysis of purified mitochondria and submitochondrial fractions, we showed the mitochondrial localization of an isoform of Sorcin with an electrophoretic
motility lower than 20 kDa that specifically interacts with TRAP1. Furthermore, the effects of overexpressing
or downregulating Sorcin and/or TRAP1 allowed us to demonstrate a reciprocal regulation between these two
proteins and to show that their interaction is required for Sorcin mitochondrial localization and TRAP1 stability. Indeed, the depletion of TRAP1 by short hairpin RNA in colorectal carcinoma cells lowered Sorcin levels
in mitochondria, whereas the depletion of Sorcin by small interfering RNA increased TRAP1 degradation. We
also report several lines of evidence suggesting that intramitochondrial Sorcin plays a role in TRAP1 cytoprotection. Finally, preliminary evidence that TRAP1 and Sorcin are both implicated in multidrug resistance and
are coupregulated in human colorectal carcinomas is provided. These novel findings highlight a new role for
Sorcin, suggesting that some of its previously reported cytoprotective functions may be explained by involvement in mitochondrial metabolism through the TRAP1 pathway. Cancer Res; 70(16); 6577–86. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The intrinsic or acquired resistance to anticancer drugs remains one of the most serious problems responsible for the
failure of cancer chemotherapy (1). The cellular basis underlying multidrug resistance is not fully understood, and several mechanisms have been proposed. Our group recently
showed that TRAP1, a mitochondrial chaperone (Hsp75)
with antioxidant and antiapoptotic functions (2), is involved
in the multidrug resistance of human colorectal carcinoma
cells (3). In fact, TRAP1 protein levels are increased in

HT-29 colorectal carcinoma cells resistant to 5-fluorouracil
(FU), oxaliplatin (l-OHP), and irinotecan (IRI), and in the majority of human colorectal cancers. Furthermore, HT-29 colorectal carcinoma and Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells transfected
with TRAP1 exhibited a phenotype resistant to FU-, l-OHP–,
and IRI-induced apoptosis, whereas a TRAP1 dominantnegative deletion mutant sensitized tumor cells to apoptotic
cell death (3). Recent studies showed that TRAP1 can be proposed as a novel molecular target in localized and metastatic
prostate cancer (4), and some other tumors (5), whereas
other authors have pointed out that TRAP1 protects against
oxidative stress and against focal ischemia in rat brain
mitochondria (6).
Little is known about TRAP1 signal transduction. Kang and
colleagues (7) identified TRAP1 as a member of a cytoprotective network selectively active in mitochondria of tumor
tissues. Other studies suggested an involvement of this chaperone in cell adhesion and synaptic morphology through the
modulation of N-cadherin expression (8). Starting from this
limited information, a proteomic analysis of TRAP1 coimmunoprecipitation complexes was performed in our laboratory
to further characterize the TRAP1 network and evaluate protein interactors relevant for TRAP1 role in multidrug resistance. Among several proteins, we identified Sorcin as a
new TRAP1 interactor. Sorcin is a 21.6-kDa Ca2+-binding
protein that is a member of the penta EF-hand protein family

and is widely distributed among mammalian tissues such as
skeletal muscle, kidney, and brain, but most abundantly in
cardiac muscle (9). After Ca2+ binding, the overall hydrophobicity of the protein increases, and this leads to the translocation from the cytoplasm to cell membranes, resulting in
Ca2+-dependent interaction with other proteins (e.g., the ryanodine receptor; ref. 10). Although several biochemical studies
are available on the direct binding of Sorcin to both cardiac
ryanodine receptor RyRs (9) and voltage-dependent L-type
calcium channel CaV1.2 (11, 12), little is known about the
function of this soluble Ca2+-binding protein in chemoresistance. Indeed, intracellular Ca2+ concentration may play a role
in the development of chemoresistance, as suggested by clinical trials with verapamil, a Ca2+ channel blocker which selectively enhances drug cytotoxicity in MDR cell lines (13). Thus,
some studies, aimed at investigating the regulatory role of Ca2+
in Taxol resistance, have suggested that chemoresistant cells
express higher levels of the Ca2+-binding protein Sorcin and
the antiapoptotic Bcl2, compared with the parent cell line
(14). Both these proteins have previously been implicated in
chemoresistance, in part due to their ability to modulate
Ca2+ levels. Other reports suggest a correlation between Sorcin and the multidrug-resistant MDR1/P-glycoprotein: it has
been shown that the knockdown of Sorcin induces the upregulation of MDR1 in HeLa cells (15); by contrast, a direct
correlation between Sorcin and multidrug resistance overexpression has also been reported in human gastric cancer cell
lines and vincristine-resistant gastric cancer cells (16–18).
Finally, recent studies aimed at evaluating changes in gene
expression profile in oral squamous cell carcinoma and
non–small cell lung cancer identified a cDNA homologous
to Sorcin expressed only in tumors, apparently responsible
for drug resistance and poor prognosis (19, 20).
This study shows for the first time that TRAP1 and a Sorcin isoform with an electrophoretic motility of 18 kDa interact in mitochondria, and that the result of this interaction
may serve as an additional or alternative indirect route by
which both proteins can regulate apoptosis and chemoresistance in colorectal carcinoma cells.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals, cell cultures, constructs, short hairpin
RNAs and small interfering RNAs
l-OHP, FU, and IRI and all reagents were purchased by
Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise specified. MG-132 was purchased by Merck Chemicals Ltd-Calbiochem; shepherdin
and control scrambled peptides were synthesized by PRIMM
as reported in ref. (7).
Human Saos-2 osteosarcoma and HCT-116 colon carcinoma cells were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC) and cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1.5 mmol/L glutamine, and 100 U/mL penicillin and streptomycin. Cell lines are routinely monitored in
our laboratory by microscopic morphology check. Authentication of cell lines has been checked before starting this
study, <1 year ago, through standardized techniques by evaluating, respectively, the haplotype in Saos-2 cells (HLA A2,

A3, Bw16, and Bw47) and the presence of a mutation in codon 13 of the ras proto-oncogene in HCT-116 cells, according
to ATCC product description.
Full-length TRAP1 cDNA was cloned in pRc-CMV vector
(Invitrogen; ref. 21). cDNAs for 22- and 18-kDa sorcin isoforms were cloned in pRc-CMV or p-cDNA 3.1 vectors each
carrying HA or Myc epitopes at the COOH terminus, respectively. Small interfering RNAs (siRNA) of TRAP1 and Sorcin
were purchased from Qiagen. For knockdown experiments,
siRNAs were diluted to a final concentration of 20 nmol/L
and transfected according to the manufacturer's protocol.
TRAP1-stable interference was achieved by transfecting
HCT-116 cells with TRAP1 (TGCTGTTGACAGTGAGCGACCCGGTCCCTGTACTCAGAAATAGTGAAGCCACAGATGTATTTCTGAGTACAGGGACCGGGCTGCCTACTGCCTCGGA)
or scrambled (sequence containing no homology to known
mammalian genes) short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) (Open
Biosystem).
Fluorescence microscopy
The analysis of immunofluorescence was performed with a
confocal laser scanner microscopy Zeiss 510 LSM (Carl Zeiss
Microimaging GmbH), equipped with Argon ionic laser (Carl
Zeiss Microimaging GmbH) whose λ was set up to 488 nm, a
HeNe laser whose λ was set up to 546 nm, and an immersion
oil objective, 63 ×/1.4 f.
Cotransfection experiment in cultured HCT116 cells were
with 18-kDa Sorcin and mitochondria-targeted red fluorescence protein (p-mitoRFP) expression vectors.
Proteomic analysis of TRAP1 coimmunoprecipitation
complexes
Lysis and immunoprecipitation procedures. TRAP1 complexes were isolated from Saos-2 osteosarcoma cell total
extracts by affinity purification. Stable cells expressing
TRAP1-HA were lysed and then incubated onto anti-HA
agarose–conjugated antibody overnight under gentle stirring.
Beads were collected by centrifugation (3,000 rpm for
5 minutes*), extensively washed with lysis buffer supplemented with 150 mmol/L NaCl to eliminate nonspecific bound
proteins. Elution of the desired protein complexes was performed by competition with HA peptide in elution buffer.
The eluted proteins were precipitated in methanol/chloroform and then loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE. The gel was
stained with colloidal Coomassie blue (Thermo Scientific).
Protein bands were excised from the gel, reduced, alkylated,
and digested with trypsin (22).
Mass spectrometry analysis and protein identification
Peptide mixtures extracted from the gel were analyzed
by nanochromatography tandem mass spectrometry (MS/
MS) on a CHIP MS Ion Trap XCT Ultra equipped with a
capillary 1100 high-performance liquid chromatography
system and a chip cube (Agilent Technologies). Peptide
analysis was performed using data-dependent acquisition
of one MS scan (mass range from 400–2,000 m/z) followed by MS/MS scans of the three most abundant ions
in each MS scan. Raw data from nanochromatography

TRAP1/Sorcin Mitochondrial Network in Drug Resistance

MS/MS analyses were used to query a nonredundant
protein database using the in-house MASCOT software
(Matrix Science).
Cytotoxicity assays
Apoptosis was evaluated by cytofluorimetric analysis of
Annexin V and 7-amino-actinomycin D–positive cells by
using the FITC-Annexin V/7-amino-actinomycin D kit
(Beckman Coulter). Stained cells were analyzed by “EPICS
XL” Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Ten thousand events
were collected per sample. Positive staining for Annexin V
as well as double staining for Annexin V and 7-aminoactinomycin D were interpreted as signs of, respectively,
early and late phases of apoptosis (23). In specific experiments, HCT-116 wild-type (WT) or HCT sh-TRAP1 cells
were transiently cotransfected with pRc-CMV (mock) or
18-kDa Sorcin constructs and pEGFP-F (Clontech) and,
24 hours later, treated with 10 μmol/L, FU, IRI or l-OHP.
Drug-induced apoptosis was evaluated by propidium iodide
labeling. The transfection vector pEGFR-F, which encodes
for a farnesylated-enhanced green fluorescent protein
(EGFP-F), was used as a repoter vector both to monitor
transfection efficiency and as a cotransfection marker.
Experiments were performed at least thrice using three
replicates for each drug concentration.
Immunoblot analysis
Total cell lysates were obtained by homogenization of
cell pellets in cold lysis buffer [20 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5)
containing 300 mmol/L sucrose, 60 mmol/L KC1, 15
mmol/L NaC1, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mmol/L EDTA, 1%
(v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg/mL aprotinin, 2 mg/mL leupeptin, and 0.2%
(w/v) deoxycholate] for 1 minute at 4°C and further sonication for an additional 30 seconds at 4°C. Mitochondria
were purified using the Qproteome Mitochondria Isolation
kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Mitochondrial subfractionation was performed according to
Tang and colleagues (24). Briefly, 150 μg of mitochondria
prepared from HCT-116 cells were swollen with hypotonic
medium to break the outer mitochondrial membrane,
keeping intact the inner mitochondrial membrane. The
swollen mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation;
the supernatant contained the soluble proteins released
from the inner mitochondrial membrane; and the pellet
was the mitoplast fraction. Immunoblot analysis was performed as previously reported (2). Specific proteins were
detected by using the following mouse monoclonal antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology: anti-TRAP1
(sc-13557), anti-Sorcin (sc-100859), anti-cMyc (sc-40),
anti-COX4 (sc-58348), anti–cytochrome c (sc-13156), antitubulin (sc-8035), and anti–glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; sc-69778). The rabbit polyclonal
anti–Mn-SOD was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology,
and anti–F1-ATPase (sc-16690) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-Sorcin polyclonal antibody was a kind
gift from Prof. E. Chiancone, University of Rome “La
Sapienza”, Rome, Italy.

Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted using the Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen). The following primers used were as follows: TRAP1,

at 60°C, 5 minutes at 72°C, and 7 minutes at 72°C.
Statistical analysis
The paired Student's t test was used to establish the statistical significance between different levels of apoptotic cell
death in cell lines overexpressing 18-kDa Sorcin or TRAP1, or
in which Sorcin and/or TRAP1 expression had been knocked
down compared with the respective mock-transfected control. Statistically significant values (P < 0.05) are reported
in the Tables.

Results
Sorcin is a mitochondrial TRAP1 interactor
A “fishing for partners” strategy combined with mass spectrometric procedures was carried out to identify TRAP1 protein partners specifically interacting with the bait. Previous
studies from our group showed that TRAP1 gene expression
increased upon adaptation of human osteosarcoma cells to
chronic mild oxidizing conditions and a phenotype resistant
to H2O2– or cisplatin-induced DNA damage and apoptosis
was generated upon transfection with TRAP1 (21). Therefore,
Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells were stably transfected with the
HA-TRAP1 construct or the empty vector as control. Total
protein lysates were incubated with anti-HA–conjugated agarose beads and the retained samples were eluted by competition with HA peptide. The sample and the control were
fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE. The entire lanes from the
gel were cut into slices, and each gel slice was submitted
to the identification procedure (25). The resulting peptide
mixtures were directly analyzed by mass spectrometry (liquid
chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry, LC-MS/MS)
and identified by the MASCOT protein database search. Proteins identified in the control and the sample lanes were discarded, whereas those proteins solely identified in the sample
and absent in the control were selected as putative TRAP1
interactors. Among the putative TRAP1 binding partners,
several mitochondrial proteins, mainly components of the
membrane carrier family, were identified. Other interactors
include cytoskeleton proteins as tubulin and some actin isoforms, as well as proteins involved in cell remodeling, as previously suggested by Kubota and colleagues (8), protein
biosynthesis, posttranslational modifications and cell cycle
regulation, as previously described (26). We focused our attention on a protein of ∼18 kDa identified as Sorcin by LCMS/MS analysis. No trace of this protein could be observed in

identified showed an electrophoretic mobility corresponding
to a molecular mass slightly lower (18 kDa) than that reported in the Swiss Prot databank (22 kDa).
Our group is involved in the study of molecular mechanisms involved in chemoresistance of colorectal cancers (3).
Therefore, TRAP1/Sorcin interaction was confirmed in
HCT-116 (Figs. 1A and 2A) and HT-29 (data not shown) colon
carcinoma cells by coimmunoprecipitation experiments
using either anti-TRAP1 (Fig. 1A) or anti-Sorcin (Fig. 2A)
antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1A, Western blot analysis using
anti-Sorcin antibodies revealed two specific bands in total lysates from HCT-116 cells. Because TRAP1 is almost completely localized in mitochondria, a subfractionation of
total lysates was performed and revealed that the 22-kDa
Sorcin band is present only in the cytosolic fraction, whereas
the lower molecular weight (LMW) protein with an electrophoretic motility of ∼18 kDa is localized in the mitochondria
(Fig. 1A). Interestingly, we observed that TRAP1 interacts
specifically with the 18-kDa Sorcin isoform (Fig. 1A). Accordingly, coimmunoprecipitation analyses using mitochondrial
lysates confirmed the specific interaction between TRAP1

and the LMW Sorcin (Supplementary Fig. S1). The identification of the 18-kDa Sorcin as specific to the mitochondrial
compartment and the finding that it interacts with TRAP1
in mitochondria were both unexpected because Sorcin has
been previously described as a cytosolic protein, with no details on its specific organelle localization. The finding of two
Sorcin isoforms with different electrophoretic mobilities and
the specific interaction of TRAP1 with the LMW isoform was
further confirmed by immunoblot analysis of immunoprecipitates from HCT-116 cells transfected with either 22- or 18kDa Sorcin expression vectors (Fig. 1B). These results agree
with quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analyses on RNA purified from HCT-116 cells showing the presence of two independent transcripts encoding for two
Sorcin isoforms, namely variants a and b (data not shown),
as also reported in the BLAST databases (Supplementary Fig.
S2). Finally, fluorescence microscopy analysis shows that the
LMW sorcin isoform (a) colocalizes with mitoRFP (b) in mitochondria (Fig. 1C). To further characterize the submitochondrial compartments involved in the interaction, we
purified mitochondrial subfractions and showed that
TRAP1/Sorcin binding occurs in the mitoplast fraction,

which was separated upon hypotonic shock of purified mitochondria (Fig. 1D; ref. 24). These results agree with the submitochondrial localization of TRAP1.

amino acids are deleted (Fig. 2D). This also agrees with
the cytosolic localization of this TRAP1 deletion mutant
(data not shown).

The interaction between Sorcin and TRAP1 is specific
and requires the NH2-terminal domain of TRAP1
The binding specificity between the two proteins was
confirmed using protein lysates from HCT-116 cells in
which TRAP1 expression was notably decreased by shRNAs
(sh-TRAP1). Indeed, in these cells, coimmunoprecipitation
analysis failed to detect the interaction between TRAP1
and LMW Sorcin (compare coimmunoprecipitation analyses in Fig. 2A and B) due to the very low intracellular
TRAP1 levels after RNA interference (compare TRAP1 protein levels in the lanes of total lysates in Fig. 2A and B). As
previously shown, TRAP1 has a mitochondrial targeting sequence located at the NH2 terminus of the protein (26). To
define which TRAP1 domain was involved in TRAP1/Sorcin
interaction, we performed the same coimmunoprecipitation experiments with protein lysates obtained from
HCT-116 cells transfected either with a mutant of TRAP1
in which the first 100 amino acids at the NH2-terminal end
were fused to the myc tag (Fig. 2C), or with the ΔN mutant lacking the NH2-terminal domain of TRAP1 and carrying an HA epitope at the COOH terminus (Fig. 2D). The
results indicate that Sorcin binding requires the NH2 terminus of TRAP1 protein (Fig. 2C) and that the interaction
between these two proteins is lacking when the first 100

Reciprocal regulation of TRAP1 and Sorcin
We then sought to characterize the regulation that occurs between the two proteins upon their binding. To this
aim, we measured the levels of each protein by overexpressing or downregulating either Sorcin and/or TRAP1, respectively. Figure 3A shows that a decreased expression
of the LMW Sorcin isoform is detected in mitochondria
of sh-TRAP1 HCT-116 colon carcinoma cells compared
with WT cells. Because TRAP1 has chaperone activity
and is the only member of the HSP90 family with mitochondrial localization (26), and considering that Sorcin is
devoid of a canonical mitochondrial localization sequence,
we hypothesized that TRAP1 might be involved in Sorcin
transport to mitochondria. With this aim, we showed that
the transfection of TRAP1 expression vectors in cells with
very low amount of TRAP1 (sh-TRAP1) restores mitochondrial levels of LMW Sorcin to those observed in WT cells
(Fig. 3A). The fact that the “low Sorcin” phenotype in shTRAP1 cells is rescued upon TRAP1 transfection suggests
an involvement of TRAP1 in the mitochondrial transport
of the LMW Sorcin isoform. As a control, interference of
either HSP90 or HSP70 by specific siRNAs did not affect
the levels of Sorcin (data not shown). Conversely, TRAP1
protein levels decrease in colorectal carcinoma cells upon

that the densitometric band intensities of LMW Sorcin in mitochondria of indicated cell populations are 1 (WT), 0.21 (sh-TRAP1 cells), and 0.92

transient downregulation of Sorcin expression by specific
siRNAs (Fig. 3B). These results show a reciprocal regulation between TRAP1 and Sorcin. Previous data suggest
that this calcium-binding protein could be involved in
the regulation of the gene expression of MDR1 in HeLa
cells (15). The subcellular fractionation analysis by Western
blot shown in Fig. 3C and D indeed suggests that Sorcin's
functional role could be to contribute to TRAP1 protein
stability. In fact, the decreased TRAP1 expression observed
upon Sorcin interference (Fig. 3C, lane 2) is prevented by
the pretreatment of colon carcinoma cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 3C, lane 4). The same results
were obtained using purified mitochondrial lysates (Fig.
3D). In agreement with posttranslational regulatory mechanisms, we confirmed that mRNA levels of TRAP1 were

not affected by Sorcin interference, thus excluding transcriptional regulation (Supplementary Fig. S3).
TRAP1/Sorcin interaction is prevented upon Ca2+
chelation
It is known that Sorcin may modulate the cytoplasmic release of Ca2+, mainly from smooth endoplasmic reticulum in
neurons (27). We therefore evaluated whether TRAP1/Sorcin
interaction could be modulated by chelating free Ca2+ with
ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid. As shown in Supplementary
Fig. S4, binding between the two proteins is greatly decreased
in the presence of 0.1 mmol/L ethylene glycol tetraacetic
acid, being completely abolished at a higher concentration
(0.5 mmol/L) of the Ca2+ chelator. This suggests a regulatory
role of Ca2+ in TRAP1/Sorcin binding.

TRAP1/Sorcin Mitochondrial Network in Drug Resistance

TRAP1 and Sorcin are both implicated in multidrug
resistance and are coupregulated in human
colorectal carcinomas
We previously showed the role of TRAP1 in the resistance of colon carcinoma cells to FU-, l-OHP–, and IRIinduced apoptosis (3), and data are available on Sorcin involvement in multidrug resistance in gastric cancer cell
lines (16). Here, we confirm an analogous role of Sorcin
in drug resistance in HCT-116 colon carcinoma cells exposed to the same three drugs. Indeed, HCT-116 were
cultured for 48 hours in the presence of FU, IRI, or
l-OHP, and evaluated for the rate of apoptotic cell death.
Cell sensitivity to each drug is expressed as a ratio between
drug-induced and vehicle-induced apoptosis (Table 1). Interestingly, protection by the 18-kDa Sorcin isoform toward
the programmed cell death induced by FU, l-OHP, and IRI
is observed (Table 1). To study the functional effects of
TRAP1/Sorcin interaction on the protection from apoptosis, we evaluated the rates of apoptotic cell death in colorectal carcinoma HCT-116 cells treated with l-OHP upon
transient (siRNA) or stable (shRNA) downregulation of
TRAP1 and/or Sorcin gene expression. As shown in Table
2, the silencing of either TRAP1 or Sorcin by siRNA enhanced drug-induced apoptosis. However, TRAP1/Sorcin
double knockdown did not induce any additional effect
on cell death (Table 2), thus suggesting that the two proteins concomitantly contribute to cytoprotection by interacting and working together in a common pathway.
Accordingly, in parallel experiments, drug-induced cell
death was evaluated in sh-TRAP1 HCT-116 cells transfected
with the 18-kDa Sorcin isoform (Table 1). Interestingly, although HCT-116 cells overexpressing the 18-kDa Sorcin isoform are characterized by a reduced sensitivity to FU,

l-OHP, and IRI, the downregulation of TRAP1 abolishes this
apoptosis-resistant phenotype, further supporting the hypothesis that Sorcin and TRAP1 cooperate in protecting
from cell death and that the cytoprotective activity of Sorcin requires TRAP1 to be functioning (Table 1).
It was recently shown that shepherdin, a mitochondriadirected peptidomimetic, induces programmed cell death
by disrupting a cytoprotective pathway involving TRAP1,
selectively active in tumor cell mitochondria (7). We have
previously shown that, indeed, this network is activated
in colon carcinoma cells (3). Here, we show that Sorcin
interference by siRNAs does not increase sensitivity to
shepherdin-induced apoptosis either in the presence or
absence of TRAP1 (Supplementary Table S1). Again, these
results suggest an interdependent activity on the part of
both proteins, which interact to protect cells from mitochondrial apoptosis.
Based on the evidence that TRAP1 and Sorcin cooperate in inducing an apoptosis-resistant phenotype in
colorectal carcinoma cells, we sought to evaluate TRAP1
and Sorcin expression in human colorectal carcinomas.
Interestingly, we observed a concomitant upregulation
of both Sorcin isoforms and TRAP1 protein levels in
44% of our series of 41 human colorectal carcinomas,
and a parallel increase in TRAP1 and Sorcin mRNA expression levels evaluated by semiquantitative PCR analyses. Figure 4 shows the protein and mRNA levels of
TRAP1 and Sorcin in three tumor specimens and in
the respective normal noninfiltrated mucosas, chosen as
representative analytic results of our series. A parallel
upregulation of TRAP1 and Sorcin was observed in colorectal carcinoma cells resistant to FU, l-OHP, and IRI
(data not shown).

Discussion
This article provides evidence of a new mitochondrial network involving TRAP1 and the Ca2+-binding protein Sorcin.
Using mass spectrometry analysis of TRAP1 coimmunoprecipitating proteins, we identified Sorcin as a novel TRAP1 interactor. To our knowledge, this is the first time that Sorcin
had been found to associate to a mitochondrial protein. This
finding prompted us to investigate the subcellular localization of Sorcin because none of the previous data described
the organelle compartmentalization of this protein. Cell fractionation experiments clearly indicate the occurrence of two
main Sorcin isoforms: the 22-kDa isoform, quantitatively the
major Sorcin band, is found in the cytosol, whereas the LMW
18-kDa isoform is specifically localized in the mitochondrial
fraction. According to this finding, we show that TRAP1 interacts with the LMW Sorcin isoform within mitochondria,
more specifically in mitoplasts (Fig. 1).
Sorcin is a Ca2+-sensitive protein, interacting with many
important regulatory proteins involved in Ca2+ homeostasis.
Consistent with these features, the existence of a functional
role of Ca2+ in the interaction between Sorcin and TRAP1 is
preliminarily shown by the interference of Sorcin mitochondrial localization upon Ca2+ depletion (see Supplementary
Fig. S2). Although the role of Ca2+ in mitochondria is widely
shown, little is known about the role of Ca2+ in TRAP1 signaling. Because Sorcin is highly sensitive to the modulation
of Ca2+ levels, the interaction with TRAP1 and the consequent import of Sorcin into mitochondria, in which the homeostasis of calcium is strictly controlled (28), might
contribute to defending the Ca2+-sensitive protein against
perturbations of Ca2+ levels, most frequently observed in
the cytosolic compartment. The selective binding of TRAP1
to LMW Sorcin could also be dependent on the same subcellular compartmentalization of both proteins. However, more
in-depth analysis is required to characterize the molecular
mechanisms involved in TRAP1/LMW Sorcin interaction
(i.e., the effects of different protein structure/conformation
of Sorcin isoforms on the interaction with TRAP1).
The interaction of Sorcin with a mitochondrial chaperone
led us to investigate how the Ca2+-binding protein, which has
no canonical mitochondria-targeting sequence, is imported
into these organelles and to analyze whether Sorcin might
be translocated into the mitochondrial compartment through
a mechanism involving its interaction with TRAP1. Consistently with this assumption, we found that the localization
of Sorcin in the mitochondria of human cells is dependent
on the presence and abundance of TRAP1 (Fig. 3A). In fact,
the levels of 18-kDa Sorcin decrease upon TRAP1 knockdown
by shRNAs, whereas a rescue of this phenotype is achieved after transfection of colon carcinoma cells with TRAP1 expression vectors. Conversely, Sorcin interference might affect
TRAP1 protein stability through posttranslational mechanisms, as suggested by preliminary experiments with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 3B–D). Although further
investigation is necessary to clarify the mechanism involved
in the regulation of TRAP1 expression by Sorcin in this regard,

TRAP1/Sorcin Mitochondrial Network in Drug Resistance

it is important to underline that our findings are in line with previous studies indicating that the suppression of Sorcin induced a
>3-fold increase in the expression of MDR1 (15), thus indicating a
role by this protein in regulatory mechanisms of gene expression.
Apoptosis is the essential response induced in tumor cells by
most chemotherapeutic agents. Several mechanisms are involved in resistance to chemotherapeutic agents in tumor cells
(29). Among others, we recently studied, at a preclinical level,
the role of TRAP1 in inducing a chemoresistant phenotype in
human colorectal carcinoma (3), whereas a possible involvement of this mitochondrial chaperone in ovarian cancer has
been suggested (30). Other studies have identified TRAP1 as a
novel mitochondrial survival factor differentially expressed in
localized and metastatic prostate cancer compared with normal prostate. Targeting this pathway could be explored as novel
molecular therapy in patients with advanced prostate tumors
(4). Sorcin has been implicated in chemoresistance and cancer
as well. In fact, high levels of this protein have been reported in
cancer cell lines and vincristine-resistant gastric cancer cell
lines (16–18). Furthermore, Sorcin expression might be responsible for drug resistance and poor prognosis in non–small cell
lung tumors (19, 20). The results reported here suggest that the
previously described role of Sorcin in chemoresistance and cell
survival may be dependent on its interaction with TRAP1 and
involvement in TRAP1 mitochondrial antiapoptotic network.
To our knowledge, this study is the first evidence of a role
played by Sorcin in resistance to FU, IRI, and l-OHP, three antiblastic agents that represent the backbone of human colorectal carcinoma therapy (31). Interestingly, RNAi knockdown of

Sorcin and/or TRAP1 sensitizes human HCT-116 colon cancer
cells to anticancer compounds that induce apoptosis, suggesting that targeting the TRAP1/Sorcin network directly in mitochondria may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for
colorectal tumors. Indeed, it is very well established that regimens combining FU with IRI or l-OHP are equally effective as
first-line treatment for advanced colorectal carcinoma (31),
but achieve a response rate of 30% to 50% and an overall survival of 14 to 20 months (32). Thus, the development of novel
strategies able to counteract multidrug resistance to improve
the efficacy of systemic chemotherapy is a major issue in the
clinical management of colorectal cancer patients. In such a
perspective, our results suggest that the TRAP1/Sorcin pathway deserves to be further evaluated as a potential molecular
target in human colorectal carcinoma for the clinical development of mitochondria-targeting agents. Indeed, a derivative of
geldanamycin, 17AAG, is at present under clinical investigation in cancer patients due to its ability to block the HSP90/
TRAP1 pathway, by binding the regulatory pocket in the NH2terminal domain of HSP90 (33), whereas other small molecules (e.g., shepherdin, gamitrinibs) have been designed to
selectively accumulate in the mitochondria of human tumor
cells targeting the HSP90/TRAP1 network and acting as
ATPase antagonists (34). Finally, the clinical validation of
novel biomarkers predictive of resistance/sensitivity to specific chemotherapy regimens is urgently required in human
tumors. Thus, the novel preliminary finding of a parallel upregulation of TRAP1 and Sorcin in human colorectal cancers
highlights the existence of a functional link between the two
