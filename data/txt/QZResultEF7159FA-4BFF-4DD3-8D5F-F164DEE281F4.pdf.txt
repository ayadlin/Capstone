Abstract
The abundance of cell surface levels of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), which regulates the uptake of ironbound transferring, correlates with the rate of cell proliferation. Because TfR1 expression is higher in cancer
cells than in normal cells, it offers a target for cancer therapy. In this study, we found that the expression of
TfR1 in mouse colon cancer cells was affected by the circadian organization of the molecular clock. The core
circadian oscillator is composed of an autoregulatory transcription-translation feedback loop, in which
CLOCK and BMAL1 are positive regulators and the Period (Per), Cryptochrome (Cry), and Dec genes act as
negative regulators. TfR1 in colon cancer–bearing mice exhibited a 24-hour rhythm in mRNA and protein
levels. Luciferase reporter analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments suggested that the
clock-controlled gene c-MYC rhythmically activated the transcription of the TfR1 gene. Platinum incorporation
into tumor DNA and the antitumor efficacy of transferrin-conjugated liposome-delivered oxaliplatin could
be enhanced by drug administration at times when TfR1 expression increased. Our findings suggest that
the 24-hour rhythm of TfR1 expression may form an important aspect of strategies for TfR1-targeted cancer
therapy. Cancer Res; 70(15); 6238–46. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
In mammals, the master pacemaker controlling the
circadian rhythm is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei
of the hypothalamus (1). Regulation of circadian physiology
relies on the interplay of interconnected transcriptiontranslation feedback loops. The BMAL1/CLOCK complex
activates clock-controlled genes, including Per, Cry, and
Dec, the products of which act as repressors by interacting
with BMAL1/CLOCK (2–5). This mechanism also regulates
the 24-hour rhythm in output physiology through the periodic activation/repression of clock-controlled output genes in
healthy peripheral tissue and tumor tissue (6, 7).
Transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) is involved in the uptake of
iron into cells through the binding and internalization of
transferrin, and its regulation by intracellular iron levels
has assisted in the elucidation of many important aspects
of cellular iron homeostasis (8, 9). Iron is important for

metabolism, respiration, and DNA synthesis. Thus, TfR1 is
expressed not only in normal healthy cells but also in malignant tumor cells (8, 10). Recently, another TfR-like molecule
named TfR2 has been recognized and investigated (11, 12),
but the exact function of TfR2 remains unclear (8). It has
been reported that the expression of TfR1 in mammary
epithelial cells exhibits a significant 24-hour rhythm (13).
Such rhythmic variation in TfR1 expression seems to affect
its iron uptake function resulting in time-dependent changes
in the internalization of iron-loaded Tf. However, it is not
clear if the expression of TfR1 in colon cancer cells shows
a significant 24-hour rhythm.
Many of the pharmacologic properties of conventional
drugs can be improved through the use of an optimized drug
delivery system (DDS), which includes particular carriers
composed primarily of lipids and/or polymers (14). The high
expression of TfR1 in tumor can potentially be used to deliver
cytotoxic agents into malignant cells, including chemotherapeutic drugs, cytotoxic proteins (8), and Tf-coupled
polyethylene glycol (Tf-PEG) liposomes were designed as
intracellular targeting carriers for drugs by systemic administration. In fact, Tf-PEG liposomes encapsulating a platinum
(Pt)-based anticancer drug, oxaliplatin, can increase its accumulation in tumor masses (15, 16). On the other hand, daily
rhythmic variations in biological functions are thought to
affect the efficacy and/or toxicity of drugs: a large number
of drugs cannot be expected to have the same potency at
different administration times (7, 17). However, it is unclear
what influence the rhythmic expression of TfR1 has on the
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of transferrin targeting liposomes.

c-Myc Regulation of the 24-Hour Rhythm of TfR1

In this study, we found that the circadian expression of
c-Myc, which is controlled by the circadian clock, affects
TfR1 gene transcription in colon cancer cells. The levels of
TfR1 mRNA and protein exhibited a 24-hour oscillation in tumor cells implanted in mice. Thus, to evaluate the rhythmic
function of TfR1 and the utility for TfR1-targeting cancer
therapy, we investigated how the rhythmic variation in
TfR1 production influenced the pharmacologic efficacy of
TfR1-targeting liposomal DDS.

Materials and Methods
Animals and cells
Seven-week-old male BALB/c mice (Charles River Japan)
were housed with lights on from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. at a
room temperature of 24 ± 1°C and a humidity of 60 ± 10%
with food and water ad libitum. Colon 26 cells (Cell Resource
Center for Biomedical Research, Tohoku University) were
maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. A
25-μL volume with 2 × 107 viable tumor cells was inoculated
into the right hind footpad of each mouse. The tumor volume
was estimated according to a formula that has been described previously (7). Tissue slices of the removed tumor
masses were made, and the tumor tissue was confirmed
histopathologically.
Experimental design
To assess the temporal expression profile of TfR1 in
tumor cells, tumor masses were removed from individual
tumor-bearing mice at six different time points (9:00 a.m.,
1:00 p.m., 5:00 p.m., 9:00 p.m., 1:00 a.m., and 5:00 a.m.)
7 days after the implantation of tumor cells. The levels of
TfR1 protein and mRNA were measured by Western blotting analysis and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR
(RT-PCR), respectively. To investigate how the rhythmic
variation in TfR1 expression occurs in tumor cells, the influence of CLOCK/BMAL1 and c-MYC on the transcriptional activity of the TfR1 gene was assessed using luciferase
reporter constructs containing wild-type E-box or mutated
E-box of the mouse TfR1 promoter, which was based on
previous reports. To elucidate the role of c-MYC in the control of the rhythmic expression of TfR1, endogenous c-MYC
in Colon 26 cells was downregulated by small interfering
RNA (siRNA). The c-MYC–downregulated cells were treated
with 50% FBS for 2 hours to synchronize their circadian
clock, and the mRNA levels of TfR1 were assessed at 44,
48, 52, 56, 60, 64, and 68 hours after 50% serum treatment.
In the same manner as described above, the protein levels
of c-MYC and CLOCK were assessed by Western blotting
analysis. To explore the temporal binding of endogenous
c-MYC and CLOCK to the E-box in the mouse TfR1 gene,
chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis was performed in
individual tumor masses at 9:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. To
investigate the function of the 24-hour oscillation of TfR1
expression, time-dependent changes in Pt internalization
into tumor cells were assessed using Tf-coupled liposomes
encapsulating oxaliplatin (Tf-NGPE L-OHP). The cultured

www.aacrjournals.org

Colon 26 cells were treated with 50% FBS as described
above and then harvested for RNA extraction at 0, 6, 12,
18, and 24 hours after 50% FBS treatment. Nontreated
Colon 26 cells harvested at the same time points were used
as the control. At 6 or 18 hours after serum treatment, cells
were exposed to Tf-NGPE L-OHP (L-OHP, 0.4 mg/mL) for
3 hours. The Pt content in the DNA was measured using an
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS).
To explore the dosing time–dependent difference in the internalization of Pt into tumor cells in vivo, tumor-bearing
mice were injected with a single dose of Tf-NGPE L-OHP at
9:00 a.m. or 9:00 p.m. Plasma and tumor DNA samples were
collected only once from individual mice at 1, 3, and 6
hours after injection. The plasma concentration of Pt and
its content in tumor DNA were measured as described
above. Then, tumor volumes were measured throughout
the duration of the experiment.
RT-PCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted using RNAiso (TaKaRa). The
cDNAs of mouse TfR1 (NM011638), TfR2 (NM015799),
c-Myc (NM010849), and β-actin (NM007393) were synthesized using PrimeScript Reverse Transcriptase (TaKaRa),
and the synthesized cDNAs were amplified using GoTaq
Green Master Mix (Promega). The PCR products were run
on 2% agarose gels. After staining with ethidium bromide,
the gel was photographed using Polaroid-type film. The
density of each band was analyzed using NIH image software
on a Macintosh computer. To evaluate the quantitative
reliability of RT-PCR, kinetic analysis of the amplified products was performed to ensure that signals were derived only from the exponential phase of amplification, as previously
described (7, 17). We evaluated the validity of our semiquantitative PCR methods using real-time PCR. cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of total RNA. Real-time PCR
analysis was performed on diluted cDNA samples with SYBR
Premix Ex Taq Perfect Real-Time (TaKaRa) using a 7500
Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). In addition,
as confirmation of RNA extraction from each tumor cell
sample, the expression level of Vegf mRNA was measured
(Supplementary Data S1).
Western blotting analysis
Nuclear or cytoplasmic proteins in tumor masses were extracted using NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction
Reagents (Pierce Biotechnology). The protein concentrations
were determined using a BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology). The lysate samples were separated on 6% or
10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were reacted
with antibodies against TfR1 (Zymed Laboratories), c-MYC,
CLOCK, β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or RNA pol II
(Abcam). The immunocomplexes were further reacted with
horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies
and visualized using Super Signal Chemiluminescent Substrate
(Pierce Biotechnology). The membranes were photographed
using Polaroid-type film, and the density of each band was analyzed using NIH image software on a Macintosh computer.

Construction of reporter and expression vectors
The 5′ flanking region of mouse TfR1 (from bp +16 to +436; +1
indicates the transcription start site) gene was amplified using Elongase Enzyme mix (Invitrogen) using DNA extracted
from Colon 26 cells. PCR was performed using the forward
primer 5′-AGTTGAGCTC(SacI)GGCTTGGTGCAGCTCAGTTAGTAG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ATGAGATATC(EcoRV)
TAAATGTCCGTTGACACTAGTAACC-3′. The PCR products
were purified and ligated into a pGL4 Basic vector (TfR1-Luc).
The sequence of the CACGTG E-box (bp +290 to +295) on
TfR1-Luc was mutated using a QuikChange site-directed
mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Expression vectors for mouse
CLOCK, BMAL1, and c-Myc were constructed using cDNAs
obtained from RT-PCR derived from mouse liver RNA.
All coding regions were ligated into the pcDNA3.1 (+) vector
(Invitrogen), as previously described (7). Protein expression
levels from each expression vector in Colon 26 were assessed
by Western blotting analysis (Supplementary Data S2).

moter region, forward 5′-GTGACTCCCTTGTCAG-3′ and
reverse 5′-CCGTGACACTAGTAACC-3′. For PCR analysis,
PCR products were amplified for 40 or 45 cycles. PCR products
were run on an agarose (3%) gel, including 0.2 μg/mL ethidium
bromide, and analyzed using the NIH image software.
Determination of L-OHP (Pt) concentration
Plasma samples were obtained by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm
for 3 minutes and stored at −20°C until analysis. Tumor DNA
was extracted using a Wizard Genomic DNA Purification kit
(Promega). Measurements of the L-OHP (Pt) content in plasma and tumor DNA were made using ICP-MS at the Center
of Advanced Instrumental Analysis, Kyushu University. ICPMS is capable of detecting very small amounts of Pt. Plasma
Pt concentration and its tumor DNA content were expressed
as micrograms per milliliter and nanograms per nanogram of
DNA, respectively.
Determination of the antitumor effect
Seven days after the inoculation of Colon 26 cells into mice,
a single injection of Tf-NGPE L-OHP (L-OHP: 0, 7.5 mg/kg, i.v.)
or vehicle (9% sucrose) was given to tumor-bearing mice at
9:00 a.m. or 9:00 p.m. This dosage of Tf-NGPE L-OHP was selected based on a preliminary study (Supplementary Data S3).
In all mice, the tumor volumes were measured every 3 days
throughout the duration of the experiment.

Luciferase reporter assay
Colon 26 cells were seeded at 3 × 105 cells per well in sixwell culture plates (BD Biosciences). After an 18-hour culture,
the cells were transfected with 100 ng per well of reporter
vector and 2 μg per well (total) of expression vector using
Lipofectamine LTX reagent (Invitrogen). A 0.5-ng-per-well
sample of phRL-TK vector (Promega) was also cotransfected
as an internal control reporter. The total amount of DNA per
well was adjusted by adding pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). At
24 hours posttransfection, cells were harvested and the cell
lysate was analyzed using a dual-luciferase reporter assay
system (Promega). The ratio of firefly luciferase activity to
Renilla luciferase activity in each sample served as a measure
of normalized luciferase activity.

Results

Small interfering RNA
siRNA of the mouse c-Myc gene was designed using
BLOCK-iT RNAi Designer (Invitrogen). The siRNA oligonucleotide sequences were as follows: siRNA control sense, 5′UAGUGUGAGCACUGUGAUUCCUUGG-3′ and antisense
5′-CCAAGGAUCACAGUGCUCACACUA-3′; c-Myc siRNA
sense 5′-UAGUCGAGGUC-AUAGUUCCUGUUGG-3′ and antisense 5′-CCAACAGGAACUAUGACCUCGACUA-3′. The oligonucleotides were transfected into Colon 26 cells at a final
concentration of 20 nmol/L using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen).

Twenty-four-hour rhythm in the expression of
TfR1 in Colon 26 tumor masses
Two subtypes of TfR have been identified: TfR1 and TfR2.
In implanted Colon 26 cells, TfR1 but not TfR2 was detectable, although TfR2 was expressed in mouse liver (Supplementary Data S1B). The protein and mRNA levels of TfR1
in implanted Colon 26 cells showed a significant 24-hour
rhythm, with higher levels during the early dark phase
(P < 0.05; Fig. 1A and B). The increase and decrease in mRNA
levels of TfR1 seemed to cause the rhythm of TfR1 protein in
Colon 26 tumor masses.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays
Tumor masses were excised and treated with 1% formaldehyde for 5 minutes at room temperature to cross-link the
chromatin, and the reaction was stopped by adding glycine
to a final concentration of 0.125 mol/L. Each cross-linked
sample was sonicated on ice and then incubated with antibodies against c-MYC, CLOCK, rabbit-IgG, or goat-IgG (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology). Chromatin/antibody complexes were
extracted using a protein G agarose kit (Roche). DNA was
isolated using the Wizard SV Genomic DNA Purification
System (Promega) and subjected to PCR using the following
primers for the c-MYC binding site (E-box) of the TfR1 pro-

Regulation of the 24-hour rhythm in the
expression of TfR1 gene by c-MYC
Among these, c-MYC is a potent activator of TfR1 gene
transcription in mice and humans, and the transactivation
effect was elicited through binding to the CACGTG E-box located in the first intron region (18, 19). In addition, CLOCK/
BMAL1 heterodimers also bind cooperatively to CACGTG
E-box sequences and regulate the rhythmic expression of
their target genes (2). Thus, to establish the relevance of
the biological clock system on the expression of TfR1,
CLOCKΔ19 (CLOCK protein lacking transcriptional activity)
was overexpressed in Colon 26 cells. Clock mutant mice have

tion of the CACGTG sequence to AAGCTT reduced transcriptional activation by c-MYC from 8.1- to 1.5-fold.
Several compounds and high concentration serum have
been shown to induce and/or synchronize circadian gene
expression in cultured cells (21). Thus, to elucidate the role
of c-MYC in the circadian regulation of TfR1 expression,
the temporal expression profiles of TfR1 mRNA in c-MYC–
downregulated Colon 26 cells were investigated after 50%
FBS treatment. Brief exposure of control scrambled siRNAtransfected cells to 50% FBS resulted in the oscillation
of TfR1 mRNA levels with a period length of ∼24 hours
(Fig. 3A). On the other hand, the protein levels of c-MYC were
decreased and the mRNA levels of TfR1 failed to show a
significant 24-hour oscillation after the treatment of c-Myc
siRNA–transfected cells with 50% FBS (Fig. 3B and C). These
results suggested that c-MYC is required for generating the
time-dependent variation in TfR1 mRNA expression.
The transcription of c-Myc is regulated by components of
the circadian clock, and its mRNA levels in mouse liver and
bones have been shown to exhibit a significant 24-hour oscillation (22). The protein levels of c-MYC in Colon 26 cells implanted in mice also showed obvious 24-hour oscillations with
higher levels around the early dark phase and lower levels during the early light phase, whereas there was no obvious 24hour variation in the protein levels of CLOCK in the tumor

low-amplitude rhythms in the expression of various genes (20).
TfR1 and c-Myc expression levels were low in CLOCKΔ19
overexpressing Colon 26 cells (Supplementary Data S4). Next,
we tested whether these transcription factors participate in
regulation of the rhythmic expression of TfR1 gene in Colon
26 cells. Cotransfection of TfR1-Luc with c-MYC expression
constructs resulted in an 8.1-fold increase in promoter activity,
whereas CLOCK/BMAL1 had little effect on the transcriptional activity of the TfR1 gene (Fig. 2B). The transactivation
effect of c-MYC on TfR1 reporters was dependent on the

cells (Fig. 4A). The results of chromatin immunoprecipitation
analysis revealed that endogenous c-MYC in Colon 26 cells
bound to the E-box element in the intron region of TfR1
gene (Fig. 4B). Of particular note, the binding amounts of
c-MYC increasedat the time of day corresponding to the
peak of TfR1 mRNA expression (see Fig. 1B), suggesting that
the time-dependent binding of c-MYC to the E-box in TfR1
gene underlies its rhythmic expression. In addition, the
mRNA levels of a prototypical c-MYC–regulated gene, telomerase reverse transcriptase (23), in Colon 26 cells implanted in mice also showed time-dependent variation
(Supplementary Data S5).
Relationship between the rhythmic expression of
TfR1 and time dependency of Pt incorporation into

Tf-NGPE L-OHP is a transferrin-conjugated liposome
encapsulating L-OHP, a diaminocyclohexane Pt antitumor
agent, which forms adducts with DNA. Tf-NGPE L-OHP binds
to TfR, which is expressed on the plasma membrane and can

internalize Pt into the cell.3 Thus, to explore the function of
internalization into the cell through transferrin in the rhythmic
expression of TfR1, we investigated the temporal profile of TfR1
gene expression and incorporation of Pt into tumor DNA in
synchronized and desynchronized Colon 26 cells. A brief exposure of cultured Colon 26 cells to 50% FBS medium for 2 hours
induced an oscillation in the expression of TfR1 mRNA
(Fig. 5A). The mRNA levels of TfR1 peaked at 18 hours after
treatment of the cells with 50% FBS. The oscillation of TfR1
mRNA levels was also found on day 3 after serum treatment
(see Fig. 3). The amount of Pt incorporated into the DNA of
serum-shocked cells after treatment with Tf-NGPE L-OHP increased significantly at the time point corresponding to the
peak in the level of TfR1 protein (P < 0.05; Fig. 5B). In contrast,
in nontreated cells, neither the mRNA and protein levels of
TfR1 nor Pt incorporation showed significant time-dependent
variations (Fig. 5A and B), suggesting that the oscillation in the

expression of TfR1 underlies the time-dependent change in Pt
incorporation into tumor DNA.
Influence of dosing time on the ability of Tf-NGPE
L-OHP to inhibit tumor growth
The plasma Pt concentration decreased gradually after a
single injection of 7.5 mg/kg Tf-NGPE L-OHP (i.v.) at both dosing times, but the Pt concentration in plasma at 3 hours after
Tf-NGPE L-OHP injection was significantly higher in mice injected with the drug at 9:00 a.m. than at 9:00 p.m. (Fig. 6A, left).
On the other hand, Pt incorporation into DNA in tumor cells at
3 and 6 hours after Tf-NGPE L-OHP injection was significantly
higher in mice injected with the drug at 9:00 p.m. than at 9:00
a.m. (Fig. 6A, right). We also attempted to determine the Pt
contents in tumor DNA at over 6 hours after Tf-NGPE LOHP injection, but accurate assessment was difficult, probably
due to L-OHP–induced apoptotic or necrotic tumor cell death.
A significant antitumor effect of Tf-NGPE L-OHP was
observed when tumor-bearing mice were injected i.v. with
a single dose of 7.5 mg/kg L-OHP (Supplementary Data S3).
Thus, the dosage was set at 7.5 mg/kg to investigate whether

the antitumor effect of Tf-NGPE L-OHP was altered depending on its dosing time. The growth of tumor cells was significantly suppressed by the administration of Tf-NGPE L-OHP
(7.5 mg/kg, i.v.). The antitumor effects were more potent in
mice injected with the drug at 9:00 p.m. than in those that
received it at 9:00 a.m. (Fig. 6B). Fifteen days after injection
of the drug, the tumor volume in mice injected with Tf-NGPE
L-OHP at 9:00 p.m. was significantly smaller than that in
mice injected at 9:00 a.m. (P < 0.05).

Discussion
TfR1 is a key cell surface molecule that regulates the uptake
of iron-bound transferrin (8). It has been shown that correlation exists between the number of surface TfR1 and the rate of
cell proliferation. TfR1 expression is higher in tumor cells than
in normal cells. Thus, intracellular targeting using ironsaturated Tf as a ligand for TfR-mediated endocytosis has
attracted attention. In this study, the protein abundance of
TfR1 on Colon 26 tumor cells implanted in mice showed a
clear 24-hour oscillation. The rhythmic phase of TfR1 protein

paralleled that of its mRNA levels. However, the mechanisms
of transcriptional rhythm of TfR1 were unclear.
The molecular circadian clock operates at a cellular level
and coordinates a wide variety of physiologic processes (24).
CLOCK/BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of
Per, Cry, and Dec genes through CACGTG E-box enhancer
elements (8). The results of luciferase reporter assays and
chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that
the CACGTG E-box located in the first intron of the mouse
TfR1 gene was unable to respond to CLOCK/BMAL1 heterodimers. In contrast, as reported previously (19), c-MYC could

bind to the E-box of the mouse TfR1 gene and activate its
transcription. The amount of endogenous c-MYC protein
binding to the mouse TfR1 gene E-box fluctuated in a timedependent manner. The binding of c-MYC to the E-box increased at the time corresponding to the peak of TfR1 mRNA
expression, suggesting that c-MYC acts as a regulator of
circadian expression of the TfR1 gene in Colon 26 tumor
cells. This hypothesis was also supported by the present
findings that the amplitude of the TfR1 mRNA rhythm in
serum-shocked Colon 26 cells was decreased by the downregulation of c-MYC. On the other hand, CLOCK protein
did not bind to the TfR1 gene E-box. This may account for
the unresponsiveness of the TfR1 gene to CLOCK/BMAL1
heterodimers. The sequence surrounding the E-box and its
location had a marked influence on the transcriptional activity of CLOCK/BMAL1 (6). In fact, a CT-rich cis-acting
element of the mouse vasopressin gene confers robust
CLOCK/BMAL1 responsiveness on an adjacent E-box (25).
The absence of such a CT-rich cis-acting element around
the E-box may result in the inability of CLOCK/BMAL1 to
transactivate the mouse TfR1 gene.
Because the rhythmic phase of c-MYC protein abundance
in Colon 26 cells correlated with the time dependency of its
binding to the TfR1 gene E-box, the oscillation in c-MYC protein levels may cause the 24-hour rhythm in the expression of
downstream genes by rhythmic binding to their DNA response elements. In fact, mTERT mRNA in implanted Colon
26 tumor also showed time-dependent variation. In addition,
c-Myc is regulated by clock genes, as indicated by previous
results (26). TfR1 and c-Myc expression levels were low in
CLOCKΔ19-overexpressing Colon 26 cells. Although the
E-box of the TfR1 gene did not respond to CLOCK/BMAL1,
the molecular components of the circadian clock may
indirectly regulate the expression of the TfR1 gene in Colon
26 cells.
It was reported previously that L-OHP could accumulate in
tumor masses following delivery using Tf-PEG liposomes
(16). TfR-targeting liposomes also bind to TfR on tumor cell
surfaces and are internalized into the cells by receptormediated endocytosis. In this study, to evaluate the function
of the 24-hour oscillation in TfR1, Tf-NGPE liposomes were
used as a targeting carrier for intratumoral delivery of
L-OHP. This TfR-targeting liposomal DDS exhibited similar
pharmacokinetic properties to Tf-PEG liposomes, and i.v. administration of L-OHP encapsulated within Tf-NGPE liposomes lead to the accumulation of a high concentration of
L-OHP in tumors as much as Tf-PEG liposomes.4 The amount
of Pt in tumor DNA after Tf-NGPE L-OHP injection increased
at the times of day when TfR1 was abundant on the tumor
surface in this study. This notion was also supported by in vitro
findings that the time dependency of Tf-NGPE liposome–
delivered L-OHP into tumor cells disappeared in the absence
of the oscillation in TfR1 expression. These findings suggest
that the oscillation in the expression of TfR1 underlies the
dosing time–dependent changes in the internalization into

c-Myc Regulation of the 24-Hour Rhythm of TfR1

Figure 6. Influence of dosing time on the
ability of Tf-PEG L-OHP to inhibit tumor
growth in mice. Colon 26 tumor–bearing mice
were injected i.v. with a single dose of
Tf-NGPE L-OHP (L-OHP: 7.5 mg/kg) or vehicle
(9% sucrose) at 9:00 a.m. or 9:00 p.m.
A, dosing time–dependent differences in the
intratumoral delivery of L-OHP by Tf-NGPE
liposomes were examined. Plasma Pt
concentration (left) and Pt incorporation into
tumor DNA (right) were measured at the
indicated times after an injection of Tf-NGPE
L-OHP. Columns, mean (n = 5); bars, SEM;

the cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. In addition, after
a single injection of Tf-NGPE L-OHP, the antitumor effect of
the drug varied according to its dosing time. The dosing time
dependency of the antitumor effect seemed to be caused by
time-dependent changes in the intratumoral delivery of
L-OHP by TfR-targeting liposomes.
In the present study, it was shown that the 24-hour rhythm
of TfR1 expression in colon cancer cells was controlled by
c-MYC, and the cyclical accumulation of TfR1 caused dosing
time–dependent changes in the intratumoral delivery of
L-OHP by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Identification of
the circadian properties of molecules that are targeted by
ligand-directed DDS may aid the choice of the most appropriate time of day for their administration.
