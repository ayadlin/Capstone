BACKGROUND. Alemtuzumab (Campath-1H), a monoclonal antibody that targets
the CD52 antigen, has been approved for the treatment of fludarabine-refractory
chronic lymphocytic leukemia. However, the profound immunosuppression
caused by alemtuzumab has been associated with infectious complications.

METHODS. The authors report on the incidence and risk factors for development
of symptomatic cytomegalovirus reactivation in 113 patients with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders who received alemtuzumab-based therapy. KaplanMeier methods were applied to generate survival curves, and the log-rank test
was used to assess the difference between groups; in addition, univariate and
multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazard
ratio of death including 95% confidence intervals.

RESULTS. Cytomegalovirus reactivation was diagnosed in 25 patients (22%), and
most of those patients responded to antiviral therapy. Nine additional patients
had asymptomatic cytomegalovirus viremia.

CONCLUSIONS. With appropriate therapy, most patients achieved clearance of cytomegalovirus viremia. Low serum albumin was the only factor associated significantly with symptomatic cytomegalovirus reactivation. Cancer 2007;110:2478–

lemtuzumab (Campath-1H) is a monoclonal antibody that targets the CD52 antigen, a protein found on both B and T lymphocytes. CD52 is highly expressed on cells from patients with
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This antibody was approved
for the treatment of fludarabine refractory CLL by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration in 2001. In the pivotal study of alemtuzumab
in patients with refractory CLL,1 the overall response (OR) rate was
33%, and grade 3 and 4 infectious complications were observed in
27% of patients. Alemtuzumab also has been used as front-line therapy in patients with CLL.2 It is particularly effective in clearing CLL
cells from bone marrow and is less effective in reducing bulky
adenopathy.2
Because of the marked lymphocyte depletion caused by alemtuzumab, opportunistic infections are a concern in patients who are
treated with this antibody. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia has
emerged as an important infectious complication of treatment with
alemtuzumab. Human CMV remains latent after a primary infection

in an immune-competent host. Down-modulation of
Class II major histocompatibility antigens by the virus creates a state permissive of a latent infection,3
and reactivation is suppressed by the host immune
system.4 Compromised immunity favors CMV reactivation in the host with viral replication and development of clinical symptoms. Alemtuzumab therapy
for lymphoproliferative disorders can lead to the
release of inflammatory mediators like tumor necrosis factor a from dying malignant cells and to profound immune suppression from the killing of CD52expressing normal T and B lymphocytes, natural
killer cells, and monocytes; both situations are conducive toward CMV reactivation.
In the pivotal study among patients with refractory CLL, CMV reactivation was reported in 7.5%1 of
patients; however, the incidence probably was under
reported, because this infection was just being recognized as a complication of treatment with alemtuzumab. In the salvage setting, the reported incidence of
CMV reactivation with alemtuzumab therapy has
ranged from 20% to 43% of patients5–7; whereas, in
the front-line setting, CMV reactivation has been
reported in 10% of patients.2 In one prospective
study8 that included a small cohort of patients who
were monitored for CMV reactivation by using
assessment of CMV antigen levels in peripheral blood
leukocytes or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR),
the reported incidence of CMV reactivation was 66%.
However, no patient in that study had symptomatic
CMV reactivation, because pre-emptive therapy with
oral ganciclovir was started promptly when patients
had laboratory evidence of CMV reactivation. In this
article, we report a retrospective analysis of symptomatic CMV reactivation in patients with chronic
lymphoproliferative diseases who received alemtuzumab-based therapy, and we describe our analysis
of the potential factors that may predict for this
event.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Between 1999 and 2002, patients (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 2) with
CD52-positive, recurrent or refractory chronic
lymphoid malignancies who had a < 20% predicted
probability of achieving a response with conventional
therapy were enrolled into 2 trials of alemtuzumab
(Campath-1H)-based treatment. CD52 positivity was
defined as CD52 expression in > 20% of malignant
cells by flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry.
Untreated patients with similar diagnoses who had
a < 20% predicted probability of achieving a

2479

response with conventional therapy also were eligible. Apart from B-cell CLL (B-CLL), both studies
included patients who had a diagnosis of T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) or B-cell PLL (B-PLL),
marginal zone leukemia/lymphoma, CLL with evidence of transformation (Richter transformation),
and large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGL).
Patients who had received prior treatment with alemtuzumab but who developed recurrent disease >6
months after their last dose of alemtuzumab also
were eligible.

Treatment Schedules
Alemtuzumab was infused intravenously at doses of
3 mg, 10 mg, and 30 mg on Days 3, 4, and 5, respectively of Week 1 in both trials. In the first trial,5 alemtuzumab subsequently was administered at 30 mg
intravenously 3 times per week for up to 12 weeks.
Patients in the second trial9 received rituximab at a
dose of 375 mg/m2 intravenously on Days 1, 8, 15,
and 22. After the first week, alemtuzumab was administered at a dose of 30 mg intravenously on Days 3
and 5 of Weeks 2, 3, and 4 for a total of 7 doses of
30 mg each.
Patient received a trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole double-strength tablet orally twice daily 3 times
per week for pneumocystis carinii prophylaxis and
received antiviral prophylaxis with valacyclovir 500
mg orally daily. Patients who were enrolled in the
trial with alemtuzumab and rituximab were screened
for CMV antigenemia after 4 weeks of therapy or
when CMV reactivation was suspected (eg, fever of
unknown origin, pneumonia); whereas enrolled
patients who received alemtuzumab alone were evaluated for CMV antigenemia only if they were symptomatic.
Laboratory Testing for CMV Antigenemia
CMV antigenemia assay for pp65 antigen was performed with a CMV light kit (Chemicon International,
Temecula, Calif) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. This was performed by direct fluorescent
antigen detection with the use of a monoclonal antibody directed against the CMV pp65 structural protein. Appropriate positive and negative controls were
used.
Statistical Methods
Pretreatment characteristics were recorded prospectively for all patients. Descriptive statistics were calculated; Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to assess
differences in continuous variables between groups;
chi-square tests or Fisher exact tests were used to
assess the association between categorical variables;

and univariate and multivariate logistic regression
models were used to estimate the odds ratios of
CMV reactivation and the response to alemtuzumab
based therapy along with 95% confidence intervals.
In the multivariate logistic regression model, age,
sex, Rai stage, number of prior therapies, fludarabine-refractory disease, response to prior therapy,
number of lymph node sites involved, liver and
spleen size, hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelet count, serum albumin, lactate dehydrogenase,
alkaline phosphatase, b-2 microglobulin (b2M), absolute lymphocyte count and percentage, CD4 and
CD8 counts and their percentages, and percentage of
bone marrow lymphocytes were included; and a
stepwise model selection method was applied.
Kaplan-Meier methods were used to generate the
survival curves; then, the log-rank test was used to
access the difference between groups. In addition,
univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards
models were used to estimate the hazard ratio of
death, including 95% confidence intervals. All computations were carried out using SAS software (version 9.1; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) or S-Plus
software (version 7.0; Insightful Corp., Seattle, Wash).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
One hundred twelve patients who were treated
between May 1999 and March 2002 with alemtuzumab with or without rituximab (73 patients received
alemtuzumab alone,5 and 39 patients received alem-

tuzumab plus rituximab9) were included in this analysis. Nine patients with asymptomatic CMV
reactivation (CMV antigenemia detected on screening) were excluded from this analysis. Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The median age
was 62 years (range, 45–83 years). B-CLL was the
most frequent diagnosis (59%) followed by T-PLL
(14%). The majority of patients had Rai stage 3 or 4
disease (75%), and nearly half of patients were fludarabine refractory (49.5%). Most patients were
extensively pretreated (median number of prior
therapies 5 3). Nine previously untreated patients (8
PLL and 1 LGL with erythroid hypoplasia) were enrolled because of their overall predicted poor
response rates to conventional therapy (PLL) or lack
of standard of care treatment (LGL).

CMV Reactivation
Symptomatic CMV reactivation was documented in
24 patients (21%). Reactivation occurred in 18 of 78
patients (24%) who were treated with alemtuzumab
alone versus 6 of 39 patients (15.3%) who were treated with alemtuzumab and rituximab (P 5 .23). The
median numbers of doses of alemtuzumab in these 2
treatment groups were 12 and 9, respectively. The
median number of days from start of therapy to development of symptomatic CMV antigenemia was 27
days (range, 4–55 days). The numbers of cells per 1
million leukocytes in peripheral blood that were
positive by immunofluorescence for pp65 antigen
ranged from 1 to 2527 positive cells per 1 million

leukocytes (median, 93 positive cells per 1 million
leukocytes).
Concomitant radiologic changes in the lung were
observed in 4 patients, and 1 of those patients had
cytopathic changes associated with CMV reactivation
documented at bronchoscopy. Bronchoscopy was not
done in the other 3 patients; 1 of them had Xanthomonas bacteremia. No patient developed CMV colitis
or hepatitis.

Treatment Outcomes of CMV Reactivation
Four patients with CMV reactivation died, including
1 patient with bacteremia (Staphylococcus aureus
and Clostridium difficile colitis), 1 patient with polymicrobial pneumonia (Xanthomonas and atypical
mycobacteria), and 2 patients with progressive CLL.
Eleven patients became negative for the CMV antigen
with ganciclovir treatment alone (10 patients
received intravenous ganciclovir, and 1 patient
received oral ganciclovir), and 5 patients required the
addition of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG). One
patient responded to initial treatment with foscarnet
and IVIG, and 1 patient responded to oral valganciclovir. The only patient who had both CMV reactivation and CMV-associated cytopathic changes in a
bronchoscopic specimen did not respond to ganciclovir but eventually responded to foscarnet and
IVIG. One patient who had fever and CMV antigen
detected from a nasal wash improved on antibacterial antibiotics alone without requiring antiviral therapy.

Statistical Results
In univariate analysis, only a low serum albumin
level (entered as a continuous variable) predicted for
CMV reactivation (P 5 .01): The risk of CMV reactivation decreased by 70% for each 1-g/dL increase in
serum albumin level (Table 2). Whereas the incidence of CMV reactivation was 18% for patients who
had serum albumin levels 3 g/dL, it was 50% for
patients who had serum albumin levels <3 g/dL
(P 5 .027; odds ratio, 4.6; 95% confidence interval,
1.2–17.4) (Table 3). The range and median values of
serum albumin were comparable between patients
with and without CMV reactivation (Table 1). Serum
b2M levels did not predict for CMV reactivation.
There were no differences in overall survival
(P 5 .87) (Fig. 1) or response to treatment with alemtuzumab-based therapy between patients who did
and did not develop CMV reactivation (P 5 .7). The
pretreatment serum albumin level, along with the
number of prior treatments, response to any prior
treatment (refractory vs not refractory or no prior
therapy), and fludarabine-refractory disease (fludarabine refractory vs not refractory or no prior fludarabine), was associated significantly with response to
alemtuzumab-based therapy. With a 1-g/dL increase
in albumin, the rate of response increased 1.9 times
(P 5 .019); with >1 prior treatment, the rate of
response decreased approximately 31% (P 5 .001).
Patients who were refractory to prior treatment had a
71% decreased rate of response compared with
patients who were not refractory to prior treatment
or who did not receive prior treatment (P 5 .002).
Patients who were refractory to fludarabine had an

approximately 68% lower rate of response compared
with patients who were not refractory to fludarabine
or who did not receive prior treatment (P 5 .005).

DISCUSSION
Alemtuzumab treatment results in significant immunosuppression; normal T cells and malignant B and
T cells are depleted by this antibody.10 CMV reactivation in patients who are treated with alemtuzumab
likely results from profound T-cell suppression. A
high incidence of CMV reactivation has been
reported in patients undergoing allogeneic nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
(HSCT)11 with preparative regimens that incorporate
alemtuzumab. Recurrent CMV reactivations in allogeneic HSCT recipients conditioned with alemtuzumab have been linked to a failure to generate a
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response to CMV.12
The incidence of CMV reactivation in patients
with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders who are
treated with alemtuzumab (and who are not allogeneic HSCT recipients) varies from 10% to 66%.2,8,13
In a study of patients with previously treated CLL,
therapy with alemtuzumab and filgrastim was associated with a 43% incidence of CMV reactivation.14
Lundin et al.6 reported a 28% incidence of symptomatic CMV reactivation in patients with advanced
cutaneous T-cell disease who were treated with alemtuzumab. We previously reported a 22% incidence of
CMV reactivation in patients with CLL who were
treated with alemtuzumab for minimal residual disease after chemotherapy.15 The incidence is consistently higher in the HSCT setting.11,12 To our
knowledge, the current report describes the largest
series of patients to date with chronic lymphoproli-

ferative diseases who received treatment with alemtuzumab-based therapy, and we report an incidence
of symptomatic CMV reactivation of 22%. Screening
for CMV viremia in asymptomatic patients who are
receiving alemtuzumab may result in detection of
low levels of CMV in more patients; however, the
question of whether antiviral therapy for such
asymptomatic patients is indicated has not been
answered. In our series, 9 patients were identified
who had asymptomatic CMV antigenemia detected;
6 of those patients received antiviral therapy, 3 of
them remained asymptomatic without any CMV
directed therapy, and all 9 patients completed their
planned alemtuzumab-based therapy despite lowlevel CMV antigenemia.
Detection of the CMV pp65 antigen in peripheral
blood leukocytes and PCR-based testing for CMV
DNA in blood are the 2 most commonly used methods for detecting CMV and correlate well in patients
with symptomatic CMV disease.16 In a prospective
comparison, CMV antigen-detection methods reportedly detected viremia earlier than routine PCR-based
methods.17 Newer ultrasensitive PCR-based assays
can detect CMV viremia earlier or more frequently
than antigen-detection methods18 but may be handicapped by the burden of oversensitivity. For clinically
significant CMV reactivations, antigen-detection
methods are comparable to PCR-based methods.18
In univariate analysis, only a lower serum albumin level predicted for CMV reactivation in patients
who were treated with alemtuzumab. All but 1 of our
patients with CMV reactivation had a serum albumin
level <4 g/dL. Nguyen et al.7 also examined age, the
number of prior regimens, prior rituximab therapy,
prior splenectomy, modified Rai stage at alemtuzumab therapy (low/intermediate vs high), absolute
neutrophil count, and absolute lymphocyte count
and observed no correlation with any of those factors
and the development of CMV viremia. It is conceivable that serum albumin is a surrogate marker for
latent variables, such as integrity of immune status
or nutritional status. Pursuing the question of nutrition, we investigated for a possible correlation between percentage change in body weight during
alemtuzumab therapy and CMV reactivation, but we
did not observe any such correlation. The question
of whether aggressive nutritional intervention to correct pre-existing hypoalbuminemia will reduce CMV
activation in this setting needs to be examined prospectively. However, the association of hypoalbuminemia with CMV reactivation has been reported in
the context of solid-organ transplantation. Serial
assessment of CMV-specific antibodies and serum albumin levels after renal transplantation indicated

CMV Antigenemia and Alemtuzumab/Borthakur et al.

that a postoperative drop in CMV-specific immunoglobulin G and albumin is observed in patients with
CMV reactivation.19 Similarly, persistent hypoalbuminemia has been associated with CMV reactivation after simultaneous kidney-pancreas transplantation.20
With appropriate therapy, most patients achieved
clearance of CMV viremia. The deaths in patients
with CMV reactivation resulted from progressive disease or polymicrobial infection/septicemia. In the
current study, only 1 patient had evidence of CMV
pneumonia.
In conclusion, CMV reactivation may occur in
patients with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders
who receive treatment with alemtuzumab. Most
patients respond to appropriate antiviral therapy
without developing CMV disease, and a low serum
albumin level is a risk factor for reactivating CMV
during treatment with alemtuzumab.
