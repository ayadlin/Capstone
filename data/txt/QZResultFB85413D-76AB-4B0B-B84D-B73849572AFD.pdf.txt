BACKGROUND. Many patients with recurrent lymphoma are unable to tolerate
intensive therapies, or have disease that is refractory. Metronomic chemotherapy
offers a novel, potentially less toxic yet effective treatment strategy.

METHODS. An analysis was performed on 75 lymphoma patients who were treated with the PEP-C regimen at a single institution. The program consisted of oral
prednisone 20 mg after breakfast, cyclophosphamide 50 mg after lunch, etoposide 50 mg after dinner, and procarbazine 50 mg at bedtime with an oral antieMD

metic. All medications were administered daily until the white blood cell count
fell to less than 3.0 3 109/L, whereupon treatment was withheld until recovery
from the nadir. Therapy was then reinstituted on a daily, alternate day, or fractionated weekly basis (eg, 5 of 7 days), depending on patient tolerance. Doses given
per day were held constant.

RESULTS. Eighty percent of patients had previously received 2 or more treatments.
Overall, 69% achieved an objective response after PEP-C treatment, with 36% complete responses and 33% partial responses. Subjects with indolent histologies had
superior overall responses, complete responses, and time on therapy relative to
those with aggressive histologies. The regimen was generally well tolerated.

CONCLUSIONS. Metronomic therapy with low-dose oral agents administered in
combination for continuous, prolonged periods with minimal drug-free intervals
represents a novel, active, easily tolerated approach to management of patients
with recurrent lymphoma, particularly those with indolent histologies. Cancer

lthough lymphoma therapy has become increasingly more effective with the use of combination regimens, and more recently,
the advent of monoclonal antibodies, many patients still face recurrent or refractory disease after initial chemotherapy.1–6 Depending
on the clinical setting, these individuals may ultimately receive alternative approaches, including other combination chemotherapies,
continuous intravenous infusions designed to override drug resistance, novel agents, and/or high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell
transplantation or pharmacologic rescue.2,3,7–9 In some situations
these techniques may deliver prolonged remissions or cures; however, for many there remains a need for additional treatment. Such
strategies, which in 1 form or another may be largely palliative, ide-

ally, if not of necessity, should be simple to use, not
require intravenous administration, and allow outpatient administration.
With these needs in mind, over the past 16 years
the prednisone, etoposide, procarbazine, and cyclophosphamide (PEP-C) (C3) treatment program was
initiated.10–13 It consists of a combination of chemotherapies, all active in lymphoma, and commercially available in oral formulation. The drugs used
as single agents have been associated with response
rates from 17% to 60%.1,14 We report herein a retrospective analysis of our experience with PEP-C,
which is an active and well-tolerated treatment
option in many settings, with several distinctive possible mechanisms of action.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Patients with recurring lymphoma receiving the PEPC regimen at the Center for Lymphoma and Myeloma,
Weill Cornell Medical College were identified through
a retrospective chart review. All patients were evaluated and/or had pathology reviewed at the New York
Presbyterian Hospital, Weill Cornell Medical Center.
Treatment Schema
Patients were treated with the following oral medications: prednisone 20 mg after breakfast (morning
dose); cyclophosphamide 50 mg after lunch (afternoon dose); etoposide 50 mg after dinner (evening
dose), and procarbazine 50 mg at bedtime (night
dose) with an antiemetic, ondansetron. All medications were administered on a daily basis until the
leukocyte count declined to less than 3.0 3 109/L,
whereupon treatment was held until recovery from
the nadir. The median duration of this ‘induction’
phase was 3 weeks (range, 2 weeks to 2 months). The
subsequent holding of treatment commonly occurred
for 2–3 weeks, although these time periods varied
among patients based on the blood counts. After the
leukocyte count returned to greater than 3.0 3 109/L,
patients entered onto a ‘maintenance’ phase. During
the maintenance phase the dosing frequency (ie, the
number of days per week) was altered (variably from
daily, 5 of 7 days, every other day, twice weekly, or
once weekly) as it was titrated to maintain a white
blood cell count (WBC) of at least 3.0 3 109/L. Medications and doses given per day were held constant;
only the number of days per week was altered.
Response Evaluation
Patient charts were reviewed for predefined clinical
information including prior therapies and responses,

duration of PEP-C treatment, response to PEP-C, and
resulting toxicity. Because some patients were arbitrarily removed from PEP-C for other therapies, and
not necessarily for treatment failure or toxicity, data
reflect time on therapy (TOT) rather than progression-free, failure-free, or event-free survival. Consistent with standard criteria, all patients labeled herein
as complete responders had computed tomography
(CT)-confirmed complete resolution of all nodal/
tissue masses.15 Not all complete clinical/radiologic
responses, however, were confirmed with bone marrow biopsy. For the purposes of this report, complete
radiologic responses were considered complete
responses to distinguish them from those patients
who achieved only partial response. Toxicity was
graded according to the National Cancer Institute
CTCAE v. 3.0 criteria.16 The maximum event occurring during any course of chemotherapy was scored.
We defined ‘chemosensitive’ patients as those who
achieved a complete response with their last therapy
and ‘chemoresistant’ patients as those who had less
than a complete response with their last therapy.

RESULTS
Patients
Ninety-seven patients with lymphoma who had
received treatment with the PEP-C (C3) oral combination chemotherapy regimen were identified. Of the
97 patients treated, 22 had mantle cell lymphoma
and have been previously reported.17 The characteristics of the 75 remaining patients reported herein
are shown in Table 1. Of these patients, 80% had
received 2 or more prior therapies, almost half (47%)
were ‘chemoresistant’ or refractory to last treatment
and the majority (57%) were older than 60 years.
Overall Responses
Of the 75 patients treated, 69% achieved an objective
response (OR) with 36% complete response (CR) and
33% partial responses (Table 2). Compared with
patients with chemoresistant disease, patients with

chemosensitive disease had a higher proportion of
OR and CR, although neither of these differences
achieved statistical significance (OR: 78% vs 57%,
P 5 .083; and CR: 45% vs 26%, P 5 .150; 2-sided
Fisher exact test with a 5 .05). Patients younger than
60 years of age also tended to respond better than
older patients (OR: 78% vs 60%, and CR: 44% vs

those who received 1 prior therapy (73%), 2 prior

Response by Subtype
Response by subtype is shown in Table 3. In general,
patients with indolent histologies had superior rates
of OR and CR. Patients with follicular lymphoma
(FL) had the highest response rate (88% OR, 54% CR)
followed by marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) (71%
OR, 36% CR), and small lymphocytic lymphoma
(SLL/CLL) (67% OR, 17% CR). More aggressive histologies such as Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), large-cell
lymphoma (LCL), and T-cell lymphoma (TCL)
responded, but often to a lesser degree (HL OR 44%,
LCL OR 33%, TCL OR 60%).

Time on Therapy (TOT)/Discontinuation of Treatment
TOT in responding patients ranged from 3 weeks to
48 months (median, 10 months; mean, 131 months).
Patients with indolent lymphomas and those who
achieved a complete remission remained on therapy
considerably longer than those with aggressive
histologies or those reaching a partial response (indolent lymphoma mean, 16 months; CR mean, 17
months; aggressive histologies mean, 5 months; PR
mean, 6 months). This may reflect not only the success of therapy in indolent lymphoma but also the
tendency to use alternative strategies earlier and
more frequently in patients with aggressive histologies and those faring less well.
Reasons for discontinuation of PEP-C therapy are
shown in Table 4. Almost as many patients were
removed from therapy because of alternative choices
as actually recurring (16 vs 17). Ten patients discontinued PEP-C primarily for toxicity.

Toxicity
Because a reduction in the WBC was considered an
‘endpoint’ of induction, it was not considered as an
adverse reaction per se. Myelosuppression did occur,
sometimes for weeks, usually in heavily pretreated
patients. Nonetheless, infections requiring hospitalization occurred in only 8 patients (Table 5). There
were 4 instances of herpes zoster. Gastrointestinal
complaints, usually nausea and vomiting, prompted
4 patients to withdraw from treatment. Anemia and

PEP-C for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma/Coleman et al.

thrombocytopenia less than 100 3 1012/L were generally mild and easily managed. Hematuria occurred
in 2 patients.

DISCUSSION
Based on our experience with continuous infusions
of combination chemotherapy in lymphoma, putatively to override drug resistance mediated by the
MDR-1 gene-associated P-glycoprotein pump, the
PEP-C program was initiated to deliver continuous
combination chemotherapy in a more convenient
mode, by daily oral administration.18,19 Given the
vagaries of intestinal absorption, and the half-life of
the 4 oral medications, any true overlapping chemotherapeutic effects in the combination would be
probably expected to be minimal. More likely, there
would be a continuous sequential impact of drugs
with different mechanisms of action on cells, both
malignant and normal. Stem are reportedly higher in
MDR-1 gene expression to protect from toxic
assault.19 Indeed, myelosuppression was encountered
with the PEP-C regimen, despite low doses, suggesting that the P-glycoprotein pump protective mechanism may have been abrogated whether expressed in
normal or malignant stem cells. Myelosuppression
with PEP-C, however, was moderate and reasonably
well tolerated considering the heavy pretreatment of
most patients, including 10 who had undergone prior
autologous stem cell transplantation.
Since we initiated our program over the last 16
years, Kerbel et al.20 have advanced the concept of
low-dose metronomic (LDM) chemotherapy, which is
the close, regular administration of low-dose cytotoxic drugs over prolonged periods with minimal or
no drug-free breaks. They have shown experimentally
that LDM chemotherapy may not only be effective,
but may also be less toxic than maximally tolerated
cytoxic therapy.21–23
A major mechanism of action of LDM therapy
may be antiangiogenesis, as shown in experimental
models.24,25 Tumor vasculature, in fact, has emerged
as a clinically validated therapeutic target in various
malignancies, including lymphoma. In addition to
rationally designed molecularly targeted angiogenic
drugs, such as anti-vascular endothelial growth factor
(anti-VEGF) antibodies, many conventional therapeutic agents, such as in PEP-C, may have angiogenic
effects that may be optimized by an LDM
approach.25 Kerbel et al. have shown experimentally
that the P-glycoprotein-mediated resistance may be
overcome by using LDM single-agent chemotherapy
in combination with an anti-VEGF antibody, whereas

2231

single-agent chemotherapy alone was not effective. It
is not clear, however, whether it was a combination
of different modality agents (chemotherapy, antibody) or simply combinations of any effective agents,
ie, 2 or more chemotherapies, as in PEP-C, that are
necessary.
Therapy with putative antiangiogenic effects has
recently been employed in lymphoma. A combination of thalidomide and rituximab has been reported
effective in recurring mantle cell lymphoma.26 Thalidomide is thought to target tumor vasculature,
whereas rituximab may have both direct and indirect
effects on lymphoma apoptosis. The use of thalidomide here was to impede stromal interaction with
lymphoma cells; however, considerable antitumor
activity of thalidomide is thought to be mediated by
antiangiogenesis.
Buchstein et al.27 have given LDM chemotherapy
(cyclophosphamide 50 mg every other day) with
high-dose celecoxib to 35 heavily pretreated aggressive lymphoma patients, the majority with refractory
large cell lymphoma. The combination produced a
response rate of 37%, with 2 CRs (6%) and 9 PRs
(31%). While the patient populations are small, the
data are remarkably similar to our data using PEP-C
in aggressive histologies, where 9 of 23 patients
(39%) responded, with 4 CRs (17%) and 5 PRs (22%).
Median overall and progression-free survivals of 14.4
months and 4.7 months are comparable to the TOT
with PEP-C. In a similar approach, Shamash et al.28
employed a low-dose continuous chemotherapy outpatient regimen, consisting of lomustine, chlorambucil, subcutaneous bleomycin, intravenous vincristine,
and methotrexate with dexamethasone. This regimen
produced 67% responses, with 21% CRs. Significant
myelosuppression occurred with hospitalizations in
31% of patients. Regardless of whether this regimen
constituted true low-dose therapy, significant responses were achieved, particularly with HL. As in
our study, those patients with refractory disease did
not fare as well as individuals with chemosensitive
recurrence.
Both the oral PEP-C and the LDM therapy advocated by Kerbel et al. and others were remarkable for
their tolerability. Not only are they well tolerated
with relatively modest toxicity, but they represent an
easily administered, effective treatment of lymphoid
malignancies, particularly those with slower kinetic
growth patterns. Our findings demonstrate that the
administration of low-dose oral agents in combination for continuous, prolonged periods with minimal
drug-free intervals (metronomic therapy) may represent a novel approach to the treatment of NHL and
warrants further exploration.
