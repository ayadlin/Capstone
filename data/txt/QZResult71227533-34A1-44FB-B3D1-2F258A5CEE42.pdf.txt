Abstract
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and lethal primary brain tumor with median survival
of only 12 to 15 months under the current standard of care. To both increase tumor specificity and decrease
nonspecific side effects, recent experimental strategies in the treatment of GBM have focused on targeting cell
surface receptors, including the transferrin (Tf) receptor, that are overexpressed in many cancers. A major
limitation of Tf-based therapeutics is the short association of Tf within the cell to deliver its payload. We
previously developed two mutant Tf molecules, K206E/R632A Tf and K206E/K534A Tf, in which iron is locked
into each of the two homologous lobes. Relative to wild-type Tf, we showed enhanced delivery of diphtheria
toxin (DT) from these mutants to a monolayer culture of HeLa cells. Here, we extend the application of our Tf
mutants to the treatment of GBM. In vitro treatment of Tf mutants to a monolayer culture of glioma cells
showed enhanced cellular association as well as enhanced delivery of conjugated DT. Treatment of GBM
xenografts with mutant Tf-conjugated DT resulted in pronounced regression in vivo, indicating their potential
use as drug carriers. Cancer Res; 70(11); 4520–7. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Malignant gliomas are the most common primary brain
tumor in the United States, accounting for 70% of the
21,810 estimated new cases of brain cancer in 2008 (1–3).
Although the prevalence of malignant gliomas represents
only 1.5% of the 1,437,180 new cancers diagnosed in 2008,
glial tumors are associated with disproportionately high
morbidity and mortality (1). For instance, grade 4 astrocytomas, or glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), represent 60% to
70% of all malignant gliomas, with median survival of 12 to
15 months, despite administration of the current standard of
care (described below).
The first step in the treatment of malignant gliomas typically involves a gross surgical resection of the tumor (2). Next,
to potentially eradicate residual cancer cells not surgically
removed, the patient is given 6 weeks of radiation therapy
concomitant with the chemotherapeutic temozolomide. This
treatment is followed by an additional 6 months of maintenance temozolomide (4). Although this treatment regimen
significantly increases the 1- to 3-month median survival of

a patient newly diagnosed with GBM, there is much room
for improvement. Possible reasons for the inability to extend
survivability beyond ∼1 year include the nonspecificity of radiation therapy and temozolomide in combination with intrinsic cellular resistance to treatment (5, 6) allowing GBM
to recur after a median survival of 32 to 36 weeks (7). Consequently, a variety of agents have been investigated to combat
GBM, many of which focus on proteins involved in the
enhanced proliferative and migratory capacity characteristic
of this disease (5, 8–10). These approaches target proteins
that are selectively expressed or overexpressed in tumors to
minimize nonspecific toxicity to normal cells typical of
conventional therapies.
Motivated by early clinical successes of GBM therapeutics,
we undertook a study to improve upon the current standard
of care using the transferrin receptor (TfR) as our therapeutic
target (11–13). Specifically, we were intrigued by Tf-CRM107,
consisting of a human serum transferrin (Tf) molecule chemically conjugated to CRM107, a mutant variant of diphtheria
toxin (DT). Although this conjugate drug has shown therapeutic promise in the treatment of progressive and recurrent
GBM in both a phase I and a multicenter phase II study (5, 6),
a conditional power analysis in phase III determined that
Tf-CRM107 was unlikely to improve overall patient survival
compared with the current standard of care (14). A reasonable hypothesis to account for this poor efficacy is the rapid
cycling of Tf through the cell, severely limiting the time in
which to deliver its toxin payload (15).
The trafficking pathway of Tf, by receptor-mediated endocytosis, serves the crucial physiologic role of transporting iron
to cells. Each Tf molecule is capable of binding two ferric
(Fe3+) ions, one in each of its two homologous iron-binding

lobes, the NH2-terminal lobe (N-lobe) and the COOH-terminal
lobe (C-lobe; ref. 16). Iron-loaded Tf (holo-Tf) specifically binds
to TfR residing on the surface of all actively dividing cells. It is
well known that many tumors significantly overexpress TfR
relative to nonneoplastic tissue, ascribed to the extra need
for iron in their rapidly proliferating cells (17, 18). However,
once Tf delivers its iron to the cell, iron-free Tf (apo-Tf) still
bound to TfR is recycled to the cell surface, where it is released
from its receptor; Tf cannot re-enter cells until it acquires
more iron, a rather inefficient process at this post-delivery
site (13). Therefore, each holo-Tf molecule is restricted to a
single 4- to 5-minute passage through the cell, whereas 30
such successive cycles of trafficking might be required for a
Tf-conjugated toxin to be delivered into the cytosol (19, 20).
To enhance the delivery of drugs conjugated to Tf, we developed a mathematical model describing the Tf/TfR trafficking pathway using the principles of mass action kinetics (15).
A sensitivity analysis of the various model parameters identified decreasing the iron release rate in the endosome as a
previously unreported design criterion to enhance the cellular association of Tf. By inhibiting the delivery of ferric ions
by holo-Tf within the endosomal compartment, we manipulated the cell to recycle holo-Tf, rather than apo-Tf, to the cell
surface. Each Tf molecule could now cycle through its trafficking pathway multiple times because holo-Tf maintains a
high affinity for TfR at the cell surface and could re-enter the
cell, increasing the probability that a Tf-conjugated toxin will
deliver its cytotoxic payload. Recombinant protein technology was used to develop two mutant variants of Tf exhibiting
reduced iron release kinetics (21, 22). Both mutants contain
two point mutations, one within each iron-binding lobe specifically targeting amino acids involved in the release of iron
within the endosomal compartment. In vitro studies with
HeLa cervical cancer cells displayed significantly higher drug
delivery efficacy by both mutant Tf proteins in comparison to
the wild-type Tf control (23).
Here, we used these mutant Tf-DT conjugates in the treatment of GBM. In vitro studies with the U87 and U251 glioblastoma cell lines showed increased drug delivery efficacy
attributed to the mutant Tf proteins. Moreover, application
of mutant Tf-DT conjugates to xenografted U87:EGFRvIII
flank tumors showed superior and rapid tumor regression
when compared with wild-type Tf-DT controls. These
results establish the potential for clinical application of
mutant Tf-based therapeutics in the treatment of malignant gliomas.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
U251 glioma cells were a kind gift from Dr. Robert M. Prins
and Dr. Linda M. Liau (University of California at Los Angeles
Neurosurgery, Los Angeles, CA). U87 glioma cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. Both cell
types were seeded on 75 cm2 tissue culture flasks (Corning
Incorporated) and grown in DMEM supplemented with high
glucose (DMEM-HG; Invitrogen) with 3.6 g/L of sodium bicarbonate, 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 1 mmol/L of

www.aacrjournals.org

sodium pyruvate, 100 units/mL of penicillin (Invitrogen),
and 100 μg/mL of streptomycin (Invitrogen) at a pH of 7.4
(growth medium). The cells were incubated in a humidified
atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37°C. For in vivo use, U87 cells
were transduced with a retroviral-based pLRNL-neo-EGFRvIII
plasmid, kindly provided by Dr. Russ Pieper (University of
California, San Francisco Neurological Surgery, Brain
Tumor Research Center, San Francisco, CA), as previously
described (24). Authentication for all cell lines used in this
study was performed using the Promega Powerplex 1.2 system (Promega) for STR analysis as recommended by American Type Culture Collection. Results indicate that the cell
lines used in this study are authentic. All reagents and materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise
specified.
Production of recombinant Tf expression vectors
Recombinant Tf mutants were generated via site-directed
mutagenesis introduced into the pNUT N-His K206E hTf NG
construct using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as described previously (21). Mutations of residues in
the C-lobe, Arg632 and Lys534 to alanine, were introduced into
the plasmid already containing the N-lobe mutation, K206E,
by PCR using two sets of complimentary mutagenic oligonucleotide primers. Another plasmid coding for the NH 2 terminal hexa His-tagged nonglycosylated recombinant Tf
(wild-type Tf) served as a control (25).
Production and purification of recombinant Tf
The recombinant Tf plasmids were transfected into baby
hamster kidney cells for protein expression. The recombinant
proteins were secreted into the tissue culture medium (25).
Conversion of all recombinant Tf to the fully (and most stable) ferric form involved the addition of Fe-NTA to the tissue
culture medium. Purification was accomplished by chromatography on a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen Incorporated) using a
BioCad Sprint chromatography system. A Sephacryl S200HR
gel filtration column was used as the final step of purification, fully exchanging the proteins into 100 mmol/L of
NH4HCO3. The samples were stored at −20°C as concentrated
stock solutions (∼2.5 mmol/L; ref. 26).
Radioiodination of recombinant Tf
Holo-Tf samples were specifically radiolabeled at tyrosine
residues with Na 125I purchased from MP Biomedicals using
IODO-BEADS (Pierce Biotechnology). Size exclusion chromatography through Sephadex G10 columns was used to eliminate free 125I from the labeled protein. The specific activity
and concentration of each radioiodinated holo-Tf was determined by a phosphotungstic acid assay. The labeled protein
was used in Tf/TfR cellular trafficking studies.
Tf/TfR cellular trafficking studies
U251 and U87 glioma cells were seeded in growth medium
onto 35 mm dishes (Becton Dickinson and Company) at a
density of 3.0 × 104 cells/cm2 and 4.0 × 104 cells/cm2, respectively. Different seeding densities were used due to differences in both the size and the proliferative rates of the

cells. Following an incubation period of 14 to 16 hours in a
humidified 5% CO2, 37°C environment, the growth medium
was aspirated, and incubation medium (DMEM-HG,
20 mmol/L HEPES, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 100 units/
mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, and 1 g/L bovine serum albumin; pH 7.4) containing 1 nmol/L of radioiodinated
Tf was added to each dish. The cells were then placed in a
37°C environment for 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes, after
which the incubation medium was removed. The cells were
washed five times with ice-cold WHIPS (20 mmol/L HEPES,
1 g/L polyvinylpyrrolidone, 130 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L KCl,
0.5 mmol/L MgCl2, and 1 mmol/L CaCl2; pH 7.4) to remove
nonspecifically bound ligand. To separate cell surface Tf specifically bound to TfR from internalized Tf, 1 mL of ice-cold
acid strip (50 mmol/L glycine-HCl, 100 mmol/L NaCl, 1 g/L
polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 2 mol/L urea; pH 3.0) was added to
each dish and then placed on ice for 12 minutes. Each dish
was washed once more with 1 mL acid strip. The cells were
solubilized by adding 1 mL of 1 N NaOH to each dish for
30 minutes followed by an additional wash with 1 mL of
1 N NaOH. The two basic washes were collected, and the solution was assayed for radioactivity using a Cobra Series
Auto-Gamma Counter (Packard Instrument, Co.) to determine the amount of internalized ligand. Experiments were
performed thrice with triplicate time points for each Tf ligand.
Conjugation of recombinant Tf to DT
DT conjugates of recombinant Tf were prepared using the
chemical crosslinkers 2-iminothiolane and N-succinimidyl
3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP), purchased from
Pierce, to create a reducible disulfide bond. DT in PBS was
thiolated with an 8-fold molar excess of 2-iminothiolane for
60 minutes at room temperature. The thiolated DT was separated from free 2-iminothiolane by size exclusion chromatography using Zeba desalting spin columns (Pierce).
Recombinant Tf in PBS was reacted with a 3-fold molar
excess of SPDP for 30 minutes at room temperature. This
SPDP-modified Tf (Tf-SPDP) compound was separated from
free SPDP by size exclusion chromatography using Zeba desalting spin columns. Tf-SPDP and thiolated DT (1:1 molar
ratio) were mixed, diluted, and incubated overnight at 4°C.
Tf-DT conjugates were purified by high-pressure liquid
chromatography (AKTA FPLC Chromatographic Systems,
GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences) using two HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S200HR size exclusion columns in series (GE Healthcare).
The identity of each peak was confirmed with SDS-PAGE,
and the concentration of the 1:1 Tf-DT conjugates was quantified using the Bradford dye binding assay.
In vitro cytotoxicity studies
The sulforhodamine B cell proliferation assay was used to
quantify cell survival based on the measurement of cellular
protein content (27). U251 and U87 glioma cells were seeded
onto each well of a 96-well tissue culture plate at cell densities of 1.5 × 104 cells/cm2 and 3.0 × 104 cells/cm2, respectively.
As mentioned above, different seeding densities were used
due to differences in the cell sizes and their proliferation
rates. After overnight incubation, growth medium was

4522

Cancer Res; 70(11) June 1, 2010

aspirated, and the cells were incubated for 48 hours with
100 μL of fresh growth medium containing concentrations of TfDT spanning three orders of magnitude (10−4 to 10−1 nmol/L).
Then, 100 μL of cold 10% trichloroacetic acid was added to
each well to fix the cells at 4°C for 1 hour. The trichloroacetic
acid solution was removed, and the cells were washed four
times with distilled water then thoroughly blow-dried. Subsequently, 50 μL of a 1% acetic acid solution containing
0.4% sulforhodamine B was added to each well for 30 minutes
at room temperature. The dye solution was removed, and the
cells were washed four times with a 1% acetic acid solution to
remove unbound dye; following this step, the cells were again
blow-dried. The dye was dissociated from the proteins and
solubilized with 100 μL of a 10 mmol/L Tris base solution.
The absorbance of each well was determined with an Infinite
F200 plate reader (Tecan Systems Incorporated) at wavelengths of 560 and 700 nm. The survival of cells relative
to a control (i.e., cells incubated in growth medium without Tf-DT) was calculated by determining the ratio of the
(A 560 –A 700 ) values. Experiments were performed thrice
with quadruplicate points per each concentration.
Intratumoral therapy of mice with glioma flank tumors
The treatment regimen presented here was modeled after
the methods developed by Oldfield and coworkers for
Tf-CRM107 (28). Solid U87:EGFRvIII glioma flank tumors
were established in 4- to 6-week-old nu/nu female mice by
s.c. injection of 5 × 106 cells. This cell line expresses EGFRvIII,
a constitutively active mutant variant of EGFR, which leads
to more rapid proliferation than the typical U87 cell line (9),
allowing palpable tumors of 0.5 cm in diameter to be established in a relatively short period of 2 weeks. Flank tumors
were established on both flanks of mice to maximize mouse
usage. Each mouse participated in only one treatment cohort, eliminating the possibility of any systemic effect on
the contralateral tumor. Once tumors reached volumes of
200 mm3, they were randomly assigned into one of four treatment groups, each containing four tumors. Each tumor received a 100 μL intratumoral injection of PBS containing
no drug (the control) or 0.25 μg of one of the Tf-DT samples.
The injections occurred every other day starting at day 0 and
ending on day 6. Following the 6th day, no further injections
were given, and the tumor volume was continuously measured for a period of 4 weeks or until the mice were sacrificed
due to excessive tumor growth. Tumor measurements were
performed using calipers, and tumor volumes were calculated using the ellipsoid formula 1/2 (LW2), where L equals
length (longest diameter) and W equals width (widest part
of tumor perpendicular to L). Monitoring was performed to
observe a continued regression of the tumor, a plateau in tumor size, or tumor recurrence. All mouse experiments were
performed in accordance with the Institutional Animal Use
Committee at the University of California, San Francisco.
Histology and immunohistochemistry
Additional U87:EGFRvIII flank tumors were generated and
used for histology. Subcutaneous tumors were grown to volumes of 200 mm3 and treated intratumorally with two doses

(on day 0 and day 2) with either PBS or Tf-DT. Mice were
sacrificed and flank tumors removed 24 hours posttreatment.
Tumors were routinely fixed in phosphate-buffered 4% formalin, dehydrated by graded ethanols, and embedded in
Paraplast Plus wax (McCormick Scientific). Fixed tumors
were treated with a solution containing 0.8 μg/mL of rabbit
polyclonal cleaved caspase-3 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) for 32 minutes at 37°C. Antigen retrieval for cleaved
caspase-3 was performed for 8 minutes in Tris buffer (pH 8)
at 90°C. Sections were subsequently treated with a 3%
methanol-hydrogen peroxide solution at 22°C for 16 minutes.
Nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin. All immunohistochemistry assays were performed on the Benchmark
XT (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc.) using the iView detection system. Slides stained for cleaved caspase-3 were scored
based on the percentage of tumor cells that stained positive.
A score of 0, 1, 2, or 3 denoted that 0%, 1% to 5%, 6% to 25%,
or >25% of tumor cells stained positive for cleaved caspase-3,
respectively.

Results
Mutant Tf shows increased association with
glioma cells
The engineered ligands, K206E/R632A Tf and K206E/
K534A Tf, with a significantly increased ability to retain iron

www.aacrjournals.org

relative to wild-type Tf, were found to have an increased cellular association in a HeLa cell system (23). To determine
whether these mutants showed similar increased cellular association in glioma cells, we measured the concentration of
internalized Tf in U251 and U87 glioma cells over time and
evaluated the cumulative exposure of cells to a Tf-conjugated
drug as determined by area under the curve (AUC) analysis.
At the end of the 2-hour incubation period, the internalized
level of wild-type Tf in U251 cells was 2.29 × 104 molecules/
cell compared with values of 4.77 × 104 and 7.26 × 104 molecules/cell for K206E/R632A Tf and K206E/K534A Tf, respectively. AUC values were 2.29 × 106, 3.48 × 106, and 5.17 × 106
(molecules x minutes)/cell for wild-type Tf, K206E/R632A Tf,
and K206E/K534A Tf, respectively (Fig. 1A). These values
translate into an AUC increase of 54.7% and 147% over the
wild-type. This trend in AUC increase was confirmed by two
additional experiments yielding average AUC values of (2.75
± 0.41) × 106 (molecules x minutes)/cell for wild-type Tf compared with values of (4.15 ± 0.65) × 106 and (6.67 ± 1.32) × 106
(molecules x minutes)/cell for K206E/R632A Tf and K206E/
K534A Tf (P = 0.0173 and P = 0.0039), respectively, which
translate to AUC increases of 50.5 ± 23.4% and 142 ± 48%.
Student's t test was used to show that the increase in AUC
exhibited by each mutant Tf compared with wild type was
statistically significant (P < 0.05).
Comparable results were obtained using U87 cells
(Fig. 1B). At the end of the 2-hour incubation period, the internalization level of wild-type Tf was 2.87 × 104 molecules/
cell compared with values of 7.04 × 104 and 11.8 × 104 molecules/cell for K206E/R632A Tf and K206E/K534A Tf, respectively. AUC values were 2.95 × 106, 4.97 × 106, and 8.43 × 106
(molecules x minutes)/cell for wild-type Tf, K206E/R632A Tf,
and K206E/K534A Tf, respectively. This translates into AUC
increases of 68.4% and 186%. This trend was confirmed by
two additional experiments yielding average AUC values of
(2.50 ± 0.68) × 106 (molecules x minutes)/cell for wild-type Tf
compared with values of (4.04 ± 0.92) × 106 (P = 0.0396) and
(6.81 ± 1.41) × 106 (molecules x minutes)/cell (P = 0.0044) for
K206E/R632A Tf and K206E/K534A Tf, respectively, which
translate to AUC increases of 61.5 ± 36.7% and 172 ± 56%.
In vitro toxicity of Tf-DT
Having confirmed the increased association of the recombinant mutant Tf with glioma cells compared with wild-type
Tf, we next evaluated the in vitro efficacy of drug delivery to
glioma cells. We synthesized and administered DT conjugates of the various Tf ligands to U251 and U87 cells over
a range of concentrations for 48 hours. Each mutant Tf-DT
exhibited significantly enhanced drug delivery efficacy relative to wild-type Tf-DT (Fig. 2). Figure 2A and B correspond
to the cytotoxic effects of Tf-DT conjugates against the U251
glioma cell line, indicating that less drug is required for the
mutant conjugate to achieve the same level of cytotoxicity in
comparison to the wild-type conjugate. IC50 values, or the
concentrations at which 50% inhibition of cellular growth occurs, were 9.70 ± 0.50 pmol/L for wild-type Tf versus 6.94 ±
0.52 pmol/L (P = 0.001) and 6.47 ± 0.76 pmol/L (P = 0.002) for
K206E/R623A Tf and K206E/K534A Tf, respectively. As

shown in Fig. 2C and D, the same trend was observed with
U87 cells, demonstrating IC50 values of 15.0 ± 3.0 pmol/L for
wild-type Tf compared with values of 7.85 ± 1.55 pmol/L
(P = 0.01) and 6.82 ± 1.21 pmol/L (P = 0.006) for K206E/
R632A Tf and K206E/K534A Tf, respectively. Student's t test
was used to show that the decrease in IC50 exhibited by
both mutant Tf-DT conjugates compared with the wild-type
counterpart was statistically significant (P < 0.05).
In vivo efficacy and safety of Tf-DT delivered
systemically to mice
To determine whether this in vitro efficacy of our novel
Tf-based conjugates could be observed in vivo, we applied
our conjugates to mice with established subcutaneous glioma flank tumors. Consistent with the data obtained in Fig. 2,
the mutant Tf-DT conjugates show a significant improvement in reducing tumor bulk in flank xenografts (Fig. 3).
The results for the tumors treated with the PBS control show
rapid tumor growth due to a lack of drug treatment. Therefore, mice with these tumors were prematurely sacrificed,
and consequently, data for these tumors did not extend beyond day 8. The results for the tumors treated with the wildtype Tf-DT show a delayed growth profile. However, the data
for the average of four tumors treated with this cohort display a very large standard deviation. The reason for this
behavior is that, whereas two of the tumors in this treatment
group displayed a delayed growth profile similar to the
averaged curve, the growth of the other two tumors in the
wild-type group was suppressed with evidence of tumor

regression near the final days of the observation period. Although the reasons for this inconsistency are unclear at this
time, it is apparent that, at the dosage used, the two mutant
Tf-DT conjugates outperformed the wild-type Tf-DT. For
each mutant Tf-DT, rapid and near-complete tumor regression was observed in all four tumors. Mice were examined
and weighed daily. All mice continued to gain weight at an
equal rate throughout the treatment regardless of treatment
cohort (data not shown), suggesting that tumor apoptosis
was a specific effect of Tf-DT therapy, and not a result of systemic toxicity.
DT conjugates induce apoptosis in
U87:EGFRvIII xenografts
Following the above in vivo treatment and observation
protocol, additional tumors were treated with two doses of
each therapy. Mice were sacrificed 24 hours posttreatment
and tumors harvested for histologic and immunohistochemical analyses. Immunohistochemical analysis for expression
levels of cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 4) verified that toxin conjugate treatment decreased tumor growth through an increase
in apoptosis. U87:EGFRvIII flank tumors showed little baseline apoptosis (Fig. 4A), demonstrating low cleaved caspase-3
levels with an immunostain score of 0. The wild-type Tf-DT
induced a moderate level of apoptosis (Fig. 4B) with an
immunostain score between 1 and 2. Tumors treated with
either mutant Tf-DT showed the greatest level of apoptosis
(Fig. 4C and D) with immunostain scores of 3.

Discussion
TfR has been a cancer cell target of interest for many years
because of its naturally high expression in cancer cells. Both
monoclonal antibodies to TfR and the Tf ligand itself have
been used to selectively target therapies to tumors whereas
minimizing toxicities toward nonneoplastic cells and tissue
(29). In some cases, the use of Tf monoclonal antibody–based
conjugates was preferred over Tf-based conjugates because
(a) Tf only has a short period of time to deliver its payload
and (b) high endogenous levels of Tf might prevent the Tf-drug
conjugates from reaching cancer cells (30). However, other
studies have found that the alternative trafficking behavior
of Tf monoclonal antibody–based conjugates, which seem to
be targeted to the lysosome for degradation rather than following the conventional recycling pathway, might adversely
influence the effectiveness of protein drugs such as DT and
CRM107 (15).
Recently, we identified a novel design strategy to increase
the time Tf spends inside a cancer cell. Through the aid of
a mathematical model of the Tf/TfR trafficking pathway, we
determined that decreasing the iron release kinetics of Tf
in the acidic endosome is an effective means of increasing

the drug delivery efficacy of Tf. With knowledge gained
from recent work regarding the mechanism of iron release
within the Tf/TfR cell cycle (16, 21, 22, 25, 26), we used
site-directed mutagenesis to generate two mutants of Tf,
K206E/R632A Tf and K206E/K534A Tf. These mutations
were highly effective in decreasing Tf iron release within
the acidic endosomal compartment (31); each mutant possesses a single point mutation in each of the two lobes
which effectively blocks or drastically slows iron release
from either lobe.
The K206E mutation comprises one half of a motif in the
N-lobe known as the dilysine trigger (22, 32). The dilysine
trigger is comprised of two lysine residues, K206 and K296,
which facilitate the release of iron at the acidic pH of the endosome. By converting lysine at position 206 to glutamate,
iron removal from this lobe is significantly inhibited by the
formation of a salt bridge between the negatively charged
Glu206 on one side of the binding cleft and the positively
charged Lys296 on the other side. In a similar fashion, iron
release from the C-lobe is influenced by a pH-sensitive triad
comprised of three amino acid residues, Lys534, Arg632, and
Asp634 (21). Alanine scanning revealed that substitution of
an alanine residue to either Lys534 or Arg632 significantly inhibited iron removal from the C-lobe.
We therefore generated K206E/R632A Tf and K206E/
K534A Tf and subjected these mutants to in vitro drug delivery efficacy studies in HeLa cells. This study provided
proof-of-principle that manipulation of Tf was an effective
means of altering its drug delivery efficacy and thereby
helped to circumvent the problem of the short association
time of wild-type Tf within cells. The study presented here
substantiates this finding and extends the applicability of
our approach in vitro to a second tumor type, GBM, and
further translates these in vitro results into glioma xenograft
models in vivo.
The restricted nature of GBM within the brain cavity confines it to a region of generally low TfR expression separated
from systemic circulation via the largely impregnable bloodbrain barrier (33, 34). Although this permits the possibility of
specifically targeting DT to neoplastic tissue whereas minimizing toxicities toward normal brain tissue, the blood-brain
barrier along with high endogenous levels of Tf precludes the
intravenous application of Tf-DT. To address these issues, we
intend to administer the mutant Tf-DT conjugates locally in

the treatment of GBM. Although systemic therapies are
generally preferred, the current treatment of GBM already
involves an invasive surgical resection procedure; therefore,
patients with GBM are expected to be more open to local
therapies, as suggested by the clinical trials of Tf-CRM107.
Moreover, direct application allows for on-site tumor delivery
of therapeutics in high concentrations and effectively provides the therapeutic agent immediate access to the tumor
site. For example, convection-enhanced delivery could be
used for the direct application of our novel therapeutic, as
in the case of Tf-CRM107 (6), in which convective mass
transfer facilitates intratumoral drug distribution over a larger tumor volume, enhancing its tumor accessibility (35, 36).
In this scenario, the high endogenous Tf concentration is a
desirable feature because any mutant Tf-DT conjugates that
diffuse away from the tumor site and into the systemic
circulation would be outcompeted by endogenous Tf for
available receptor sites on normal tissue.
The earlier success of Tf-CRM107 in phase II clinical trials,
in which the conjugate was well tolerated by patients with
GBM, indicates that clinical potential exists for the mutant
Tf-toxin conjugates described in this study. Although phase
III trials of Tf-CRM107 were halted based on a conditional
power analysis predicting less efficacy than the current

standard of care, our mutant Tf-based conjugates show an
improved therapeutic efficacy that might warrant support
for continued clinical investigation of Tf as a drug carrier
against GBM.
