ABSTRACT
Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a master regulatory
transcription factor that plays an important role in the antioxidant response pathway
against anticancer drug-induced cytotoxic effects. RRx-001 is a new anticancer agent
that generates reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and leads to epigenetic alterations
in cancer cells. Here we report the RRx-001 mediated nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and
the activation of expression of its downstream enzymes HO-1 and NQO1 in tumor cells.
Inhibition of intrinsic Nrf2 expression by Nrf2-specific siRNA increased cell sensitivity
to RRx-001. Molecular imaging of tumor cells co-expressing pARE-Firefly luciferase
and pCMV-Renilla luciferase-mRFP in vitro and in vivo in mice revealed that RRx-001
significantly increased ARE-FLUC signal in cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner,
suggesting that RRx-001 is an effective activator of the Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway.
The pre-treatment level of ARE-FLUC signal in cells, reflecting basal activity of Nrf2,
negatively correlated with the tumor response to RRx-001. The results support the
concept that RRx-001 activates Nrf2-ARE antioxidant signaling pathways in tumor cells.
Hence measurement of Nrf2-mediated activation of downstream target genes through
ARE signaling may constitute a useful molecular biomarker for the early prediction of
response to RRx-001 treatment, and thereby guide therapeutic decision-making.

contact between Nrf2 and the Cul3/Rbx1 ubiquitin ligase
complex, leading to ubiquitination and degradation of
Nrf2 by proteasomes [2]. Under normal conditions,
Keap1 retains Nrf2 in the cytoplasm and ubiquitinylates
Nrf2 to maintain its cellular threshold. Under oxidative
stress, the Nrf2-Keap1 interaction is disrupted by the
modification of Keap1 at cysteine 151 and protein kinase
C-mediated phosphorylation of Nrf2 at serine 40 [3–4].
These modifications allow the release of Nrf2 from Keap1,
resulting in the translocation of Nrf2 from cytoplasm to
nucleus, where Nrf2 heterodimerizes with small Maf
or Jun proteins and binds to the antioxidant response
element (ARE) in the upstream UTR of promoter regions
and initiates transcription of antioxidant genes [5–6].
Many studies have reported that Nrf2 and its downstream
target genes are overexpressed in cancer cells, providing

INTRODUCTION
Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)
is a redox-sensitive master regulatory transcription factor
that plays an important role in the antioxidant response
pathway against chemotherapeutic drug-induced cytotoxic
effects by oxidative stress [1]. Nrf2 in particular regulates
the expression of antioxidant genes such as heme
oxygenase 1 (HO-1), glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic
subunit (GCLC), and NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone
1 (NQO-1), which neutralize intracellular accumulation of
reactive oxygen species (ROS). Nrf2 protein level in cells
is regulated by a cluster of inhibitory proteins, including
Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and Cullin
3 (Cul3) ubiquitin ligase. Keap1 represses Nrf2 activity by
binding to its Neh2 domain and consequently promoting

a growth advantage and contributing to therapeutic
resistance against chemotherapy and radiotherapy through
activation of antioxidant genes and neutralization of ROS
accumulation [7].
RRx-001 is an aerospace-derived anticancer
agent with reactive nitrogen species (RNS)-generating
chemistry that leads to epigenetic alterations, such as DNA
methylation and histone acetylation in cancer cells [8–13].
RNS, a collective term that includes highly reactive species
such as peroxynitrite (ONOO−), nitrogen dioxide radical
(•NO2), and other nitrogen oxides, are formed when nitric
oxide (NO), which is abundantly induced by RRx-001 under
hypoxic conditions, reacts with superoxide anion (O2−). In
turn, RNS regulate DNA methyltransferases and histone
deacetylases. The broad-spectrum epigenetic modulator
activity of RRx-001 leads to resensitization of chemo- and
radio-resistant tumor cells to therapeutic intervention, and
is a focus of several ongoing clinical trials [13, 14]. Cell
growth arrest induced by RRx-001 correlates with increased
ROS/RNS production. Inhibition of ROS generation by
N-acetylcysteine attenuates the antiproliferative effects
of RRx-001 [11]. These findings suggest a crucial role of
ROS and RNS as effectors of RRx-001-induced pro-oxidant
damage and epigenetic activity in cancer cells.
A Phase I clinical trial demonstrated encouraging
therapeutic responses in a heavily pretreated, chemo- and
radioresistant patient population with multiple types of
cancers. RRx-001 monotherapy was well tolerated, with
no dose-limiting toxicities [14]. Preliminary data from
an ongoing randomized proof-of-concept Phase II study
of RRx-001 vs. regorafenib suggest a positive trend in
overall survival compared to regorafenib alone in patients
with advanced colorectal cancer (Carter C. et al. Annals of
Oncology. 2015; 26(suppl 2):ii4-ii5).
To date no predictive factor of response has been
described for RRx-001. Herein, we report the results of
molecular imaging studies in vitro and in mice bearing
murine squamous cell carcinoma SCC VII tumors
co-expressing ARE-Firefly luciferase reporter to measure
ARE signaling while constitutive CMV-Renilla luciferasemRFP fluorescent protein measures cell viability in
response to treatment with RRx-001. The results suggest
that Nrf2-ARE and its downstream gene expression may
serve as a biomarker for predicting response of tumors
to RRx-001 treatment, and to select cancer patients
who would be most likely to respond to and benefit from
RRx-001 therapy.

the ARE sequence in the 5′-UTR of antioxidant genes
and initiates transcription (5–6). To investigate whether
RRx-001-generated ROS and RNS activate endogenous
Nrf2 in tumor cells, SCC VII cells were treated with
2  μM or 5 μM RRx-001 for 24 hours (h). Cells were
lysed and cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were isolated
for immunoblot analysis. Results showed that the
intensity of the cytoplasmic Nrf2 protein bands was not
significantly different in cells with or without treatment of
RRx-001 (Figure 1A). However, treatment with 2 or 5 μM
RRx-001 caused a 6-fold increase in the amount of nuclear
Nrf2 protein compared to the baseline (0 μM RRx-001),
indicating that RRx-001 activated endogenous Nrf2 and
caused nuclear accumulation in SCC VII cells.
Next, we investigated RRx-001-induced activation of
endogenous Nrf2 in SCC VII tumors in vivo. Mice bearing
SCC VII tumors were treated with a single intravenous dose
of 10 mg/kg RRx-001. Tumors were collected 24 or 48 h
later and cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were isolated for
immunoblot assay. As shown in Figure 1B, the intensity of
both cytoplasmic and nuclear Nrf2 proteins was much higher
in RRx-001-treated tumors compared to that from control
tumors without RRx-001 treatment (CTL). The cytoplasmic
Nrf2 proteins were increased by 2.0- and 2.4- fold in
tumors at 24 h and 48 h, respectively, after a single dose
of 10 mg/kg RRx-001 compared to control tumor without­
RRx-001 treatment. The nuclear Nrf2 level also increased
to ~ 1.6- and 2.3- fold at 24 h and 48 h, respectively,
after 10 mg/kg RRx-001 treatment. These results indicate
that treatment with RRx-001 not only facilitated nuclear
translocation of Nrf2, but also upregulated endogenous Nrf2
expression in SCC VII tumors in mice.
To verify the effect of RRx-001 on Nrf2 activation,
we assayed the expression of Nrf2 downstream antioxidant
enzymes HO-1 and NQO1 in RRx-001 treated cells in vitro
and in vivo in tumor-bearing mice. SCC VII cells were
exposed to 0, 2, or 5 μM of RRx-001 in growth medium for
8 h or 24 h, and whole cell lysates were used to assay the
HO-1 and NQO1 enzyme levels by Western blot. For the
in vivo study, mice bearing SCC VII tumors were injected
intravenously with one dose of either solvent or 10 mg/kg
RRx-001, and ~ 8 h and 24 h later tumors were collected
after whole animal perfusion with PBS. Whole tumor
homogenates were used to assay the HO-1 and NQO1
protein levels by Western blot. As shown in Figure 1C,
the levels of HO-1 and NQO1 in RRx-001 treated cells
in vitro were significantly increased in a dose- and timedependent manner. HO-1 enzyme increased by ~2-fold after
8 h exposure, and then returned to the basal level at 24 h.
The NQO1 enzyme increased by 2- to 4-fold at 8 h and
over 6-fold at 24 h. The levels of HO-1 and NQO1 in RRx001-treated tumors in mice were also increased by 13% and
20% for HO-1, and 12% and 27% for NQO1 at 8 h and 24 h,
respectively, post-RRx-001 injection, compared to solvent
control tumors (p < 0.05 for all RRx-001-treated tumors
compared to control, n = 6 per time point) (Figure 1D).

response of cells to RRx-001 treatment by using a
modified MTT cell proliferation assay (WST-8 assay).
Cells transfected with Nrf2 siRNA (Nrf2 C2 and
Nrf2 C3) were more sensitive to RRx-001 compared
to parental cells (wild) or cells transfected with
scrambled siRNA (Ctl siRNA), with IC50 of 1.09, 1.04,
0.74, and 0.75 μM for parental, scrambled siRNA and

(Figure 2B).

SCC VII cells were transiently transfected with
either Nrf2 siRNA or scrambled siRNA, and Nrf2
expression and response to RRx-001 were assayed. As
shown in Figure 2A, Nrf2 expression was significantly
decreased in cells transfected with Nrf2 siRNA (Nrf2 C2
and Nrf2 C3). The protein level of Nrf2 was decreased
by 40% compared to the level in cells transfected with

per mouse) in each of RRx-001- and vehicle-treated
groups. Figure 4 shows representative images of SCC VII
tumors in mice with 5 animals/10 tumors for each group.
The pre-treatment images were taken 24 h before RRx001 injection. The quantitation of ARE reporter gene
signal was normalized by the RLUC-mRFP signal from
the same tumor. There was a significant increase in the
ARE-FLUC signals (5-fold higher compared to control)
at 8 h following a single dose of RRx-001 treatment, and
that was maintained at high levels until 24 h, while there
was no obvious change in the ARE-FLUC signals in the
vehicle control-treated group. In a separate study, we
treated mice with a lower dose of 5 mg/kg RRx-001 and
found that the level of activation of ARE-FLUC signals
was not significantly different from 10 mg/kg RRx-001
(Supplemental Figure 1).

SCC VII tumor cells were stably co-transfected with
ARE-Firefly luciferase (ARE-FLUC) pathway reporter gene
and CMV-Renilla luciferase-monomeric red fluorescent
protein (RLUC-mRFP). The ARE-FLUC reporter gene
was used to measure ARE signaling, while the constitutive
RLUC-mRFP signal was used to measure the cell viability in
response to RRx-001 treatment. Positive clones were double
selected by puromycin and G418, and further enriched by
FACS, and verified for the expression of both reporter genes
by a dual-luciferase reporter assay system. A single clone
of cells co-expressing ARE-FLUC and CMV-RLUC-mRFP
was expanded and used for evaluating ARE-FLUC response
to RRx-001 treatment. The known Nrf2 activator TBHQ was
used as a positive control in the study. The results showed
that there was a dose- and time-dependent activation of
ARE-FLUC reporter gene by RRx-001, with a maximum
activation at 6 h post-treatment with 2.3 μM of RRx-001
(Figure 3). The ARE-FLUC reporter signals gradually
decreased at RRx-001 doses of 4.7–18.7 μM, mainly due
to the cell killing effect at these high doses of RRx-001 as
indicated by decreased CMV-RLUC-mRFP signals. These
results indicate that RRx-001 is an effective activator of the
Nrf2-ARE pathway.

Correlation of ARE activity and tumor response
to RRx-001 treatment
Many studies have reported that the overexpression
of Nrf2 and its downstream genes in cancer cells provides
a survival benefit and growth advantage [7]. The Nrf2ARE signaling pathway is also involved in acquisition
of resistance against anticancer therapies through
activation of antioxidant genes and suppression of ROS
accumulation and neutralization of electrophiles [7,
15–17]. We first evaluated the effect of co-expression of
ARE-FLUC and CMV-RLUC-mRFP reporters on SCC
VII tumor growth. Mice were subcutaneously inoculated
with 5 × 105 cells of the parental and ARE-FLUC/ CMVRLUC-mRFP expressing SCC VII cells, and the tumor
take rate and tumor size were monitored daily for 14 days.
Results showed that the tumor take rates in syngeneic
mice were 95% (19 tumors of 20 implanted) for both the
parental and the ARE reporter-expressing tumor implants.

The ARE-FLUC/CMV-RLUC-mRFP expressing tumors
grew as aggressively as the parental tumors in mice with
a tumor volume quadrupling time (TVQT, 4 times its
pretreatment volume) of approximately 3.0 ± 0.3 and 3.5 ±
0.7 days for the parental and the ARE-FLUC/CMV-RLUCmRFP tumors, respectively (Supplemental Figure 2).
There was no statistical difference in TVQT between the
parental and the ARE-expressing tumors (n = 8, P = 0.09).
The result indicates that the ARE reporter transfection did
not significantly alter the SCC VII tumor growth pattern.
Next, we studied the tumor response to RRx-001
treatment and analyzed the correlation between the tumor
response and the ARE reporter gene expression before
and after RRx-001 treatment. Mice were subcutaneously
inoculated with 5 × 105 ARE-FLUC/CMV-RLUC-mRFP
expressing SCC VII cells. Two tumors per animal were
inoculated on the left and right lower flank. Ten days after
tumor inoculation, mice with tumors of average size of
150 mm3 were selected and randomized into two groups
with 8 tumors per group: 1) vehicle control and 2) RRx001 treatment group. Mice were imaged for ARE-FLUC
expression 24 h before and after RRx-001 administration.
Results showed that a single dose of 10 mg/kg RRx-001
inhibited tumor growth and produced a tumor volume
quadrupling time (TVQT) of 5.7 ± 1.3 days compared
to 3.3 ± 0.7 days of vehicle control group (P < 0.05).
The linear regression analysis of the tumor growth delay
(4X TGD, i.e. the difference between the TVQT of
RRx-001-treated tumors compared to that of untreated
control tumors) showed that the 4X TGD of each tumor
was negatively correlated to its pre-treatment level of the
ARE signal (Figure 5; R2 = −0.69, P = 0.02). A relatively
low level of the pre-treatment ARE-FLUC signal
correlated with improved response to RRx-001 compared
to tumors with no pre-treatment signal; this same pattern
of correlation occurred even among individual tumors
within the same host mouse. The correlation analysis also
showed that there were no correlations between posttreatment ARE-FLUC signals at 8 h – 24 h and the tumor
response to RRx-001 treatment (R2 = 0.2 – 0.4, P > 0.05).

Taken together, the data suggest that the pre-treatment
ARE expression, reflecting the basal level of Nrf2
activity, is a biomarker for early prediction of therapeutic
response to pro-oxidant RRx-001 treatment.

DISCUSSION
RRx-001 is a small molecular pan-epigenetic
agent with ROS/RNS-generating properties that targets
hypoxic tumor cells [11–13]. Antitumor activity has been
demonstrated both in preclinical models and in patients
with heavily pretreated refractory solid tumors [11, 14].
Apart from epigenetic alterations, RRx-001 acts via
pleiotropic mechanisms including redox signaling and
redox-induced dysregulation of many different signal
pathways such as Nrf2, p53, PARP cleavage, HIF1 alpha,
and G6PD activity [18]. RRx-001 also triggers p53  and
p21 activity in response to double-stranded DNA breaks
as well as deregulates cancer cellular energetics and
metabolism [13]. In this study, we explored the impact
of RRx-001 on Nrf2 activation in SCC VII tumor
cells harboring the ARE-FLUC reporter vector. When
ARE-FLUC-expressing SCC VII cells were treated with
RRx-001, activated ARE-FLUC signal was clearly detected.
The ARE-FLUC signal after exposure to 2.3 μM RRx-001
was 2.3-fold higher than observed in untreated control cells,
and equal to 80% of the signal achieved from cells treated
with 20 μM of TBHQ, a known Nrf2 activator.
Nrf2 is a transcription factor that controls the
expression of a set of phase II detoxifying enzymes such as
NQO1, HO-1, GCLC, GST, UGT, and Mrp. Nrf2 signaling
itself is regulated by a variety of mechanisms from the
transcriptional control of the Nrf2 gene to activation of
ARE by the Nrf2 complex. The Nrf2-Keap1 complex is
the most important regulator of Nrf2 nuclear translocation
through proteasomal degradation [19]. Keap1, an
E3-ubiquitin ligase, targets Nrf2 for ubiquitin-dependent
degradation, and is the major mechanism by which Nrf2
nuclear levels are tightly controlled in cells. In addition to

Keap1, Nrf2 degradation is also controlled by glycogen
synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3)-mediated phosphorylation of
two of its serine residues in the sequence DSGISL, which
allows β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP)
to ubiquitinate Nrf2 and promote its degradation [20].
In parallel to these proteins, many other proteins are
identified as Nrf2 stabilizers either by directly binding
with Nrf2, such as p21 Cip1/WAF1 [21], BRCA1 [22–23] and
DJ-1 [24], or through indirect binding with Keap1 [25].
In oxidative stress, Nrf2 is phosphorylated and trafficked
into the nucleus where it recruits its client protein smallmaf and binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE),
leading to the coordinated induction of antioxidant
genes. Similarly, through the release of ROS and RNS,
RRx-001 activates Nrf2 with the subsequent induction of
downstream target gene expression.
Nrf2 activity has been labeled a “double-edged
sword” with both anti- and pro-tumorigenic properties,
which can be both beneficial and deleterious: on the one
hand, Nrf2 protects normal cells from oxidative stress
and confers protection against tumorigenesis, while, on
the other hand, it promotes ROS detoxification and tumor
cell proliferation [7]. In general, the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway
protects the cell and exerts a beneficial effect, delaying
or preventing the onset of diseases like atherosclerosis,
Alzheimer’s disease, and rheumatoid arthritis [2].
However, the dark side of Nrf2 is that it also contributes
to chemo- and radio-resistance of human cancers [15–17],
since activation of the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway by anticancer
therapeutics increases the intracellular antioxidant
capacity and therefore not only protects cancer cells but
may also accelerate their proliferation. In this context,
Nrf2 inhibitors may help to overcome treatment resistance.
Hence anticancer therapies may be made more effective
if the mechanisms by which Nrf2 activators and/or
inhibitors mediate the transition from anti- to pro-apoptotic
effects are better understood. As demonstrated here,
RRx-001 activates Nrf2-ARE signaling while exerting
cytotoxicity by oxidative damage; however its effect in
tumors with higher basal levels of activated Nrf2-ARE
signaling is reduced as compared to tumors with lower
activation.
Nrf2 regulates the production of mitochondrial and
cytosolic ROS through NADPH oxidase [26] and therefore
knockdown of Nrf2 provokes ROS accumulation and
ultimately induces lethal DNA damage. As we reported
here, genetic knockdown of the endogenous Nrf2 expression
by Nrf2-specific siRNA increased the sensitivity of cancer
cells to RRx-001. This result clearly suggests that in
combination with Nrf2 inhibitors the anti-cancer properties
of RRx-001 will be enhanced, while RRx-001-induced
activation of Nrf2 may have beneficial effects on ROSmediated diseases like diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and
atherosclerosis. In fact, a number of chemically diverse
Nrf2 activators have been identified  and preclinically
evaluated for therapeutic properties. Activation of
Nrf2 by sulforaphane reduced hyperglycemia-induced
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

stimulation of the hexosamine and PKC pathways
and increased excretion of the glycating agent, methylglyoxal
[27]. Cinnamic aldehyde, caffeic acid phenethylester and
bardoxolone methyl, which similarly activate Nrf2, are under
investigation for treatment of diabetes complications [28,
29]. Beside these chemical compounds, varieties of natural
compounds have also been identified as Nrf2 activators [30,
31]. However, all of the above activators, unlike RRx-001,
lack apoptosis-inducing properties, and further research
is needed to determine their therapeutic potential in other
major diseases.
In summary, molecular imaging of ARE-FLUC
and RLUC-mRFP co-expressing tumors in vitro and
in tumor-bearing mice reveals that RRx-001 is a potent
activator of the Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway via ROS/
RNS generation. The level of the pretreatment signal
of ARE-FLUC in tumors is inversely correlated with
the tumor response to RRx-001 treatment. Inhibition of
endogenous Nrf2 expression by Nrf2-specific siRNA
increases the cellular sensitivity to RRx-001 treatment.
These results suggest that the basal level of Nrf2 and/or
its downstream gene expression and/or genes expressed
under ARE may serve as a biomarker for predicting
therapeutic response of cancers to RRx-001 treatment,
and for selection and stratification of cancer patients
who would be most likely to respond and benefit from
RRx-001 therapy. Furthermore, the combined use of
RRx-001 and Nrf2 inhibitors may enhance the anticancer
efficacy and therefore this approach requires further study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
RRx-001 was obtained from ATK Aerospace
Systems [10]. The synthesis and characterization of
RRx-001 is reported in detail elsewhere [8–12]. For
in vitro cell culture experiments, RRx-001 was dissolved
in DMSO and then diluted with growth medium with
a final concentration of DMSO at < 0.05%. For animal
experiments, RRx-001 formulation was prepared by
dissolving 10 mg RRx-001 in 0.5 mL DMA-PEG 400
(1:2) and then diluting with double distilled water to
obtain a 2 mg/mL solution for injection.
The
pcDNA-ARE-FLUC
and
pcDNACMV-RLUC-mRFP vectors were constructed in our
lab. Nrf2-specific small interfering RNA (Nrf2-siRNA,
sc-37049), scrambled siRNA (sc-37007), transfection
reagents (sc-29528 and sc-36868), and antibodies against
Nrf2 (sc-13032), HO-1 (sc-10789), NQO1 (sc-393736),
ß-actin (sc-130656) and lamin-B (sc-365962) were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA.

medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented
with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and
100 μg/mL streptomycin in a 37°C humidified incubator
with a mixture of 95% air and 5% CO2. The identity of
cells has regularly been confirmed throughout the course
of the studies by observation of the growth pattern and
cell morphology in vitro and in vivo. All experiments
were performed on exponentially growing cells with cell
population doubling times of approximately 20 h.
To silence the expression of endogenous Nrf2, SCC
VII cells were transiently transfected with Nrf2-specific
small interfering RNA (Nrf2-siRNA) by following
the manufacturer’s protocol. SCC VII cells were also
transfected with a scrambled siRNA as a non-specific
control. Briefly, SCC VII cells were seeded at a density
of 1.0 × 106 cells/­60-mm dish and transfected with either
120 pmol of Nrf2 siRNA or scrambled siRNA in siRNA
transfection reagent-containing medium for 24 h at 37°C.
The siRNA-containing medium was then replaced with
normal growth medium and incubated for an additional
24 h. Nrf2 expression and response to RRx-001 treatment
were then assayed using Western blot and WST-8 assay
(Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) as
previously reported [11].
To create a stable cell line co-expressing AREFirefly luciferase (ARE-FLUC) and CMV-Renilla
luciferase-monomeric red fluorescent protein (RLUCmRFP) fusion proteins, cells at 80% confluency in
100-mm plates were co-transfected with 10 μg each
of pcPUR-ARE-FLUC and pcDNA-CMV-RLUCmRFP plasmids by lipofectamine-mediated transfection
(Supplemental Figure 3). Single clones of cells coexpressing both the reporter genes were double selected
by puromycin and G418, and a colony was picked after
bioluminescence imaging and sorted twice by FACS in
RFP window. The expanded cells were evaluated by dualluciferase reporter assay for FLUC and RLUC reporter
activities in vitro.

Nrf2-activator tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) and with
RRx-001 in various concentrations at different time points.

Western blot analysis
After exposure to RRx-001, cells were washed
twice with cold PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer or NE-PER
nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction buffer (Pierce
Biotech, Rockford, IL) for extraction and separation of
the cytosolic and nuclear proteins. For tumor samples,
tumor-bearing mice were euthanized in a CO2 chamber
at designated time points after RRx-001 treatment and
perfused with 50 ml PBS to remove blood cells. Tumors
were homogenized in 20 mM HEPES buffer (containing
1 mM EGTA, 210 mM mannitol and 70 mM sucrose),
centrifuged and the supernatants were used for Western
blot. The protein contents were quantified using a
Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).
Samples containing equal amounts of total protein (20 μg)
were resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred
onto PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked
with 5% non-fat milk and probed with primary antibody
and HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). The immunoreactive proteins were
detected with ECL plus chemiluminescence detection
reagents (Amersham Biosciences, GE Life Sciences,
Pittsburgh, PA), and quantified by ImageJ program (v1.47,
NIH). The Western blot analyses were run at least twice,
unless otherwise specifically indicated.

Tumor model and therapy
Nude mice, male, 7–8 weeks old and 20–25 grams
in body weight, were purchased from Charles River
Laboratories. Mice were acclimated under specific
pathogen-free conditions in the Veterinary Service Center
of Stanford University animal facilities for 3–5 days before
starting each experiment, and sterilized food and water were
available ad libitum. Mice were injected subcutaneously in
the left and right lower flank with 5 × 105 SCC VII tumor
cells stably co-expressing ARE-FLUC and CMV-RLUCmRFP in 0.05 ml Hank’s solution. Two tumors were
implanted per mouse. When tumors reached an average
size of 150 mm3 (10 days after implantation), mice were
randomly assigned to the treatment groups and imaged.
RRx-001 was injected i.v. at doses as specified in each
experiment. The tumor size was measured with calipers
before treatment, and three times a week thereafter until
the tumor volume reached at least 4 times (4 ×) the pretreatment volume. The tumor volume was calculated
using the formula: tumor volume = π/6 × length × width2.
The tumor volume quadrupling time (TVQT, 4 ×)) was
determined by a best-fit regression analysis. The tumor
growth delay (TGD) is the difference between the TVQT
of treated tumors compared to that of untreated control

In vitro dual-luciferase assay
A dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to
verify the expression of FLUC and RLUC in transfected
SCC VII tumor cells. Cells (1 × 106) were lysed in 200 μl
of passive lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) by gently
shaking for 10 min at room temperature, and the whole
cell lysate was centrifuged at 10, 000 rpm for 5 min. The
cleared supernatant of 20 μl was mixed with 100 μl of
LARII solution (Promega) and measured for 10 seconds on
a GloMax-20/20-luminometer (Promega). Similarly, a 20 μl
aliquot of lysate was mixed with 1 μg of coelenterazine
in 100 μl of PBS for RLUC signal measurement by
luminometer. The total protein content of each sample was
used to normalize the results. The cells were also tested
for the ARE-FLUC response by inducing with the known

tumors. Both the TVQT and TGD were calculated for each
individual animal, and then averaged for each group. The
data are presented as percent (%) of the pretreatment volume
on day 0. Body weight of animals was measured three times
a week. The animal experiments described herein were
approved by the Stanford University Administrative Panel
for Laboratory Animal Care.

Bioluminescence imaging (BLI)
A Xenogen IVIS 200 Imaging System was used
in this study. Tumors were imaged for basal FLUC,
RLUC, and mRFP signals 24 h before administration
of RRx-001. Following injection with RRx-001, mice
were imaged for RLUC signal by intravenous injection
of 50 μg of coelenterazine at 8 and 24 h post-RRx-001
treatment. Similarly, mice were imaged for FLUC signal
6 h after RLUC imaging by intraperitoneal injection
of 3  mg of D-Luciferin in 100 μl PBS. The animals
injected with vehicle (without RRx-001) served as the
untreated control. The BLI signals over the region of
interest (ROI) were quantified by Living Image software
(Caliper Life Sciences, Alameda, CA). The BLI signals in
RRx-001-treated tumors were quantitated and compared
with the BLI signals of untreated control tumors. The
mRFP signal was collected at all imaging sessions by
excitation at 580 nm/emission at 610 nm.
