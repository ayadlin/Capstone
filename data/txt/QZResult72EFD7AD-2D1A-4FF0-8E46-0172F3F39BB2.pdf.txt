Abstract
Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) show promise as cancer therapeutics; however, the full scope of their
utility remains unknown. Here we report findings that strongly rationalize clinical evaluation of HDACis in
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST), a class of highly aggressive, therapeutically resistant, and
commonly fatal malignancies that occur sporadically or in patients with the inherited neurofibromatosis type-1
(NF1) syndrome. We evaluated the effects of the chemical HDACis PCI-24781, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid,
and MS-275 on a panel of human NF1-associated and sporadic MPNSTs in vitro and in vivo. A subset of MPNSTs
was found to be highly sensitive to HDACis, especially to PCI-24781. All cell lines in this group were NF1associated. Significant proapoptotic effects were noted in vitro and in vivo and were independent of p53
mutational status. In contrast, as a group the sporadic –MPNST cells were markedly resistant to HDACi
treatment. HDACis were found to induce productive autophagy in MPNST cells. Genetic and/or pharmacologic
autophagy blockade resulted in significant HDACi-induced apoptosis in cells defined as resistant or sensitive,
leading to abrogated growth of primary tumors and lung metastases in tumor xenograft assays. Among
autophagy-associated genes expressed in response to HDACi, the immunity-related GTPase family, M was
validated as a critical target in mediating HDACi-induced autophagy and enhanced apoptosis. Taken together,
our findings strongly support the evaluation of HDACi currently in clinical trials as an important new
therapeutic strategy to treat MPNST, including in combination with autophagy blocking combination regimens
in particular for patients with sporadic MPNST. Cancer Res; 71(1); 185–96. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are
rare malignancies originating from Schwann lineage cells and
arising proximate to peripheral nerves (1, 2). MPNSTs account
for 3% to 10% of all soft tissue sarcomas (STS) and are highly
aggressive histologic subtype (3–5). More than 50% of these
occur in patients with the inherited neurofibromatosis type-1
(NF1) syndrome; approximately 8% to 12% of NF1 patients will
develop an MPNST in their lifetime, commonly arising within

a preexisting deep, plexiform neurofibroma (6, 7); the remainder develop sporadically (6). In adults with NF1, MPNSTs are
the most common malignancy, the major source of morbidity,
and the leading cause of NF1-related mortality (8, 9). Complete
surgical resection, frequently not feasible due to local invasiveness and/or uncontrollable metastases, is the only potentially curative option; radio- and chemotherapy have not
demonstrably affected survival, underlying 20% to 50% 5-year
survival rates (1, 8, 9). Lack of effective systemic therapies is
the major unresolved MPNST clinical problem; new therapeutic approaches are urgently needed.
Recently, attention has focused on potentially reversible
alterations in chromatin structure that modulate gene expression during malignant transformation (10). Histone deacetylases (HDAC) play an important role in the epigenetic
regulation of gene expression by catalyzing the removal of
acetyl groups from histone and non-histone proteins, stimulating chromatin condensation, and promoting transcriptional repression and other molecular processes (11). The
emerging delineation of HDAC-driven alterations that coincide with tumorigenicity and malignant progression has provided impetus for development of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi)
as novel cancer therapeutics (12, 13). Such initiatives are
prompted by broad growth-inhibitory and cytotoxic HDACi
effects observed in cultured cancer cells (with normal cell

sparing), and significant in vivo effects seen in human tumor
xenograft models (14). To date, more than 15 early-phase
clinical trials have documented HDACi potential efficacy in
multiple cancer types (15, 16).
We have recently shown in vitro and in vivo efficacy for broad
spectrum hydroxamic acid-based HDACis [suberoylanilide
hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and PCI-24781] against a range of
genetically complex STS, especially when administered in
combination with doxorubicin (17). MPNSTs were not
included in these original investigations; to the best of our
knowledge, the effect of HDACi on these tumors has not been
assessed. The goal of this study was to bridge this investigational gap and to evaluate the effects of HDACis on MPNST is a
preclinical setting.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
Human NF1-related MPNST cell lines ST88-14, T265, and
S462, and non-NF1 sporadic human MPNST cell lines STS26T
and MPNST724 were maintained and propagated as previously described (18). Primary cultured normal human
Schwann cells (NSC) served as controls. The NF1-associated
cell line MPNST642 was established by us (Supplementary
Data); DNA fingerprinting (short tandem repeat; Supplementary Data) was conducted for all cell lines less than 6 months
prior to the conduct of the studies, confirming that no crosscontamination has occurred. STS26T and MPNST724 cells
were stably transfected to express GFP-LC3; overexpressing
cells were FACS-sorted on the basis of green fluorescent
protein (GFP) expression. HDAC inhibitors included PCI24781 (Pharmacyclics), SAHA, and MS-275 (Cayman Chemical). Bafilomycin and chloroquine were obtained from Sigma.
Commercially available antibodies were used for immunoblot
or immunohistochemical detection of acetylated H3, acetylated H4 (Millipore); acetylated tubulin (Sigma); caspase-3,
LC3B (Cell Signaling); GFP, beclin, p53, actin (Santa Cruz);
immunity-related GTPase family, M (IRGM), PARP (Abcam);
Ki-67 (MIB-1), vim (Dako); and S-100 (Biogenex).
Cellular assays
MTS, clonogenicity, and soft agar colony formation assays
were performed as previously described (19). Doses needed
to inhibit growth by 50% (GI50) were determined. Western
blot analyses were performed by standard methods (17).
Apoptosis was measured using the Apoptosis Detection
kit I (BD Biosciences) as per manufacturer's recommendations. Further information is available as Supplementary
Data.
Transfection procedures
siRNAs and p53 construct transfections procedures are
described in Supplementary Data.
Gene Expression Assays
Gene expression profiling was conducted using the Autophagy RT2 Profiler PCR Array (SABiosciences). RT-PCR and
qRT-PCR were conducted by standard methods. Additional

information and primer sequences are provided in Supplementary Data.
Transmission Electron Microscopy and Quantification
of acidic vesicular organelles
Assays were performed as previously described (20). Additional information is provided in Supplementary Data.
In vivo animal models
All animal procedures/care was approved by UTMDACC
Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committee. Animals
received humane care as per the Animal Welfare Act and the
NIH "Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals." Animal
models were utilized as previously described (17). Animal
models, therapeutic schemas, drug doses, and immunohistochemical procedures are provided in Supplementary Data.
Statistics
Cell culture-based assays were repeated at least thrice; mean
 SD was calculated. Cell lines were examined separately. For
outcomes that were measured at a single time point, 2-sample
t tests were used to assess the differences. Differences in
xenograft growth (tumor/metastases) in vivo were assessed
using a 2-tailed Student's t test. Significance was set at P  0.05.

Results
HDACis induce significant apoptosis in a subset of
human MPNST
HDACi effects on human MPNST cell growth and clonogenicity were evaluated. Six MPNST cell lines were used
including the NF1-associated MPNST642 cell line recently
established by us (Supplementary Fig. S1); primary cultured
(NSC served as controls. Three HDACis were tested: PCI24781, SAHA, and MS-275. PCI-24781 induced a time- and
dose-dependent growth inhibition that was most pronounced
in a subset of cell lines tested independent of growth rate (see
Supplementary Results). Figure 1A depicts GI50s at 48 hours; 4
MPNST cell lines were markedly sensitive to PCI-24781, with
GI50s ranging between 0.1 and 0.35 mmol/L, whereas the 2
additional cell lines (STS26T and MPNST724) were relatively
resistant exhibiting GI50s more than the clinically relevant
dose (>1 mmol/L). NSCs were resistant to PCI-24781 growth
inhibitory effects. Higher doses of SAHA and MS-275 were
needed to achieve PCI-24781–equivalent MPNST growth inhibition; however, a similar response pattern was found for all
these drugs, enabling MPNST cell designations to "sensitive"
and "resistant" cohorts (Fig. 1A). A similar pattern of response
was noted when the effect of HDACis on colony-forming
capacity was evaluated (Fig. 1B). This pattern was also
reflected in the induction of apoptosis by these compounds
(Fig. 1C). Marked apoptosis (evaluated by Annexin-V/PI staining FACS analysis) was seen in "sensitive" cell lines whereas no
significant apoptosis was induced in "resistant" cells. Similarly,
an increase in cleaved caspase-3 was seen in "sensitive" but not
in "resistant" cells (Fig. 1C). A time- and dose-dependent
increase in target protein acetylation could be observed in
all the cell lines regardless of the growth inhibitory effects

(Fig. 1D). This aligns with previously published data showing
that protein acetylation occurs even in normal cells that are
relatively resistant to HDACi effects suggesting that although
drugs are delivered into the cells and reach their intended
targets, additional molecular mechanisms drive therapeutic
sensitivity and resistance (21).
Because HDACis have also been shown to exert antitumor
effects through activation of wild-type p53 (22), and p53
deregulation is a common event in MPNST (23) the p53
mutational status of these cells was evaluated (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). These studies indicated that in MPNST, HDACi
response is independent of p53 mutation/function. Interestingly, we observed that all MPNST cells in the "sensitive" group
are NF1-associated whereas both "resistant" cell lines are
sporadic (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
HDACi sensitivity/resistance pattern is recapitulated
in vivo
Human MPNST xenografts (Supplementary Fig. S1), including HDACi "sensitive" (MPNST642) and "resistant" (MPNST724
and STS26T) tumors, were used to evaluate the effects of
HDACi on tumor growth in vivo. PCI-24781 was selected
because of its enhanced efficacy in vitro. As shown in Figure
2A, a relatively low (25 mg/kg/d) PCI-24781 dose markedly
abrogated the growth of MPNST642 xenografts. A significant
decrease in average tumor size and weight of treated tumors
as compared to controls was noted at study termination (P ¼
0.00016 and 0.0004). In contrast, no significant growth inhibitory effects were seen in MPNST724 (Fig. 2A) and STS26T
(data not shown) xenografts, although a higher dose of PCI24781 was tested (50 mg/kg/d). In accordance, immunohistochemical analysis of tumor sections for cell proliferation
(Ki67) and apoptosis (TUNEL) confirmed that PCI-24781
induced antiproliferative, proapoptotic effects in the "sensitive" tumors (P ¼ 0.008 and 0.0008), but not in the MPNST724
xenografts (Fig. 2B). Together, these data suggest that a subset
of MPNSTs is highly sensitive to HDACi monotherapy in vitro
and in vivo. In addition, HDACi "resistance" observed in vitro
can be recapitulated in vivo, offering a novel model for further
investigation of HDACi tumor response mechanisms.
HDACis induce autophagy in MPNST cells in vitro and
in vivo
To further evaluate HDACi-induced structural changes in
"resistant" cells, transmission electron microscopic (TEM)
evaluation was conducted: a large number of cytoplasmic
autophagosomes was noticed after treatment [24 (Fig. 3A),
48, and 72 hours] but no signs of apoptosis were seen.
Although the noted autophagosome accumulation suggests
drug-induced autophagy, multiple assays are needed to confirm this observation (24). Acridine-orange staining showed
increased acidic vesicular organelles in PCI-24781 (0.5 mmol/L
per 24 hours) treated compared to control dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO)-treated cells, as was confirmed via FACS analysis
(Fig. 3B). Furthermore, LC3B conversion and LC3B-II expression (normalized to actin) both increased after treatment with
all 3 HDACis tested (Fig. 3C). Because the experiments
described earlier may represent either enhanced autophago-

188

Cancer Res; 71(1) January 1, 2011

some synthesis and productive autophagy or reduced autophagosome turnover due delayed trafficking or reduced
autophagosome–lysosome fusion (24), cells were pretreated
(1 hour) with low doses of the autophagy inhibitors Bafilomycin A1 (1 nmol/L) or chloroquine (1 mmol/L) prior to PCI24781 treatment (24 hours). PCI-24781 treatment produced
increased LC3B-II expression even in the presence of these
inhibitors, providing evidence of efficient autophagic flux
(Fig. 3C). Furthermore, cells stably transduced to express
LC3-GFP, exhibited increased GFP puncta in response to
HDACi treatment (Fig. 3D). Western blot (WB) showed
increased GFP cleavage following HDACi treatment that
was blocked by pretreatment with chloroquine, further supporting HDACi-induced productive autophagy (Fig. 3D). Similarly, HDACi-induced autophagy could be observed in vivo.
Animals bearing STS26T tumors were treated with PCI-24781
for 4 days, and on day 5 tumors were harvested 2, 4, and 6
hours after final dose. WB analysis showed a time-dependent
increase in LC3B-II expression (Fig. 3D). Similarly, MPNST724/
GFP-LC3 xenografts were treated with PCI-24781, chloroquine, or their combination (Fig. 3D). A marked increase in
free GFP expression was noted in response to PCI-24781.
Chloroquine blocked HDACi-induced increases in free GFP.
HDACi-induced autophagy was not exclusive to sporadic
MPNST cells and in a series of experiments as depicted earlier
we found autophagy to occur in response to PCI-24781 in all
NF1-associated HDACi "sensitive" cells (Supplementary
Fig. S3). However, in contrast to the MPNST "resistant" cells,
morphologic features of apoptosis were also present.
Together, our data strongly support that HDACis induce
productive autophagy in MPNST cells in vitro and in vivo.
Autophagy blockade enhances HDACi proapoptotic
effects in MPNST cells
It is currently unclear whether drug-induced autophagy
contributes to cell death or possibly represents a mechanism
of therapeutic resistance (25, 26). To that end, we evaluated
the impact of autophagy blockade using complementary
genetic and pharmacologic manipulations on HDACi-induced
effects. siRNA knockdown of beclin, ATG5, and ATG7 were
conducted (Fig. 4A–C). Autophagy blockade was assessed via
LC3B-II WB; knockdown of any of the 3 targets decreased both
baseline and PCI-24781–induced LC3B-II expression. Most
importantly, enhanced apoptosis in response to PCI-24781
pretreatment of cells was found after target knockdown, as
determined via PARP cleavage and Annexin-V/PI FACS analysis (Fig. 4A–C). Pharmacologic autophagy inhibition was
achieved using bafilomycin and chloroquine (Fig. 4D). The
clonogenic capacity of STS26T or MPNST724 cells was not
affected by any of the compounds when used alone, but was
significantly affected by chloroquine or bafilomycin pretreatment of cells (1 hour) followed by PCI-24781 for 24 hours (P <
0.05). The combination also resulted in increased apoptosis.
Together, these data suggest that autophagy blockade sensitized "resistant" MPNST cells to the proapoptotic effects of
HDACi in vitro.
Next, we evaluated the impact of autophagy blockade on
"sensitive" MPNST cell lines where autophagy in response to

HDACi occurs in parallel with apoptosis. Using an experimental approach as described earlier we found that blocking

per 24 hours) of PCI24781 were used (Supplementary
Fig. S3). These data suggest that even in HDACi sensitive
cells autophagy is a potential survival mechanism opposing
apoptosis.

Additional increased LC3B-II expression in response to PCI-24781 was noticed in the presence of these inhibitors. D, cells stably transduced to
express LC3-GFP exhibited increased GFP puncta in response to HDACis (top). GFP cleavage was found in response to HDACi and was blocked by
pretreatment with chloroquine (middle). Furthermore, WB of STS26T xenografts’ protein treated with PCI-24781 (50 mg/kg/d) harvested 2, 4, and 6 hours after
final dose showed a time-dependent increase in LC3B-II expression (left, bottom). Similarly, MPNST724 GFP-LC3 xenografts were treated with PCI-24781,

GFP (right, bottom).

significant increase in apoptosis was observed in combination-treated tumors as determined by TUNEL staining (P <

Next, an experimental MPNST lung metastasis model (Supplementary Fig. S1) was used; therapy was initiated a week
after tail-vein injection and continued for 2 weeks (Fig. 5D). All
control (n ¼ 6), PCI-24781 (n ¼ 7), and chloroquine (n ¼ 7)
treated mice exhibited extensive macroscopic lung metastases
at study termination, whereas in 3 of 7 combination-treated
mice there were no visible metastases, and less than 5
metastases could be found in the remaining 4 mice. A significantly lower average lung weight was found in combination-treated mice (P < 0.05). Together, these data suggest that
autophagy blockade can sensitize MPNST to the proapoptotic
effects of HDACi in vivo.

HDACi-induced autophagy-related gene-expression
changes
Due to their mechanisms of function, one of the major
consequences of HDACi therapy is gene expression modulation. Using a focused autophagy PCR array, we sought to
identify potential autophagy-related genes in MPNST cells
whose expression is modified secondarily to HDACi treatment. Results revealed 4 genes that were reproducibly overexpressed in both cell lines and 5 that were consistently
downregulated (Supplementary Table S1). Three overexpressed genes (IRGM, CXCR4, and TMEM74) and 1 downregulated gene, NF-kB, were selected for validation. A
concordant dose-dependent increase/decrease in corresponding RNA expression levels was identified after PCI24781 treatment (24 hours; Fig. 6A). Similarly, IRGM,
CXCR4, and TMEM74 mRNA expression was increased in

expression, was selected for additional study. To confirm that

qRT-PCR and RT-PCR in xenograft tissues retrieved from experiments described earlier. C, an increase in IRGM mRNA was also identified by in response to
SAHA and MS-275 (1 mmol/L per 24 hours; left). Furthermore, a PCI-24781–induced increase in IRGM protein was shown (WB; right). D, IRGM siRNA

suggested by decreased LC3B-II expression (Fig. 6D). Most
importantly, IRGM knockdown resulted in enhanced PCI24781–induced apoptosis in both cell lines. Together, our
results implicate HDACi-induced IRGM expression and autophagy in therapeutic resistance in sporadic MPNST cells.

Discussion
There is a crucial need for improved anti-MPNST therapeutic strategies. Studies here show that a subset of human
MPNSTs is highly sensitive to HDACis antiproliferative, proapoptotic effects in vitro and in vivo; importantly, NSCs are
resistant to these effects. Both broad spectrum hydroxamic

acid-based agents (PCI-24781 and SAHA; ref. 17) and the more
selective HDAC1/HDAC2 inhibitor (MS-275; ref. 27) result in a
similar anti-MPNST response pattern. However, in support of
our previous observations in STS (17), PCI-24781 exhibited
growth inhibitory effects at nanomolar versus micromolar
doses needed for SAHA/MS-275. Of note, a phase I/II clinical
study examining the effects of PCI-24781 in combination with
doxorubicin on advanced sarcomas following failure of
anthracycline therapy has recently been initiated (28); results
support the inclusion of MPNST patients in this or other
HDACi-based clinical investigations.
With the limitations of a small testable MPNST cell-line
cohort, it is intriguing and of possible major biological and

clinical importance that all NF1-associated cells exhibited
marked HDACi sensitivity. The molecular hallmark of NF1associated MPNSTs is the loss of the GTPase activating
protein, Nf1, a rat sarcoma (RAS)–negative regulator leading
to constitutive activation of the RAS pathway (29, 30).
Previous data suggest that HDACis induce cell death selectively in cells exhibiting enhanced RAS signaling (31, 32).
Molecular deregulations such as elevated reactive oxygen
species activity and decreased STAT1 expression and/or
function, operative in cells exhibiting activated RAS, have
been proposed to underlie the increased HDACi susceptibility of these tumor cells (31, 32). HDACis were found to
exert some of their proapoptotic effects through the induction, acetylation, and/or activation of p53 (22). p53 gene and
its protein product are frequently deleted, mutated, and/or
inactivated in MPNSTs (23); this molecular deregulation is
thought to be one of the major driving forces for NF1associated neurofibroma transformation and progression
into its malignant MPNST counterpart (23). It is thus pertinent that as we have shown previously for other STS cells, no
significant HDACi response differences were seen in wildtype p53 versus p53-mutated cells (17). With the increased
interest in HDACi as anticancer therapy, our data suggest
that the NF1-associated MPNST preclinical model can be
used to establish mechanisms of action driving sensitivity,
and especially the role of Nf1 loss and RAS activation in this
process.
We found sporadic MPNST cell lines to exhibit relative
resistance to HDACis. It is important to note that the diagnosis of sporadic MPNSTs, occurring outside the context of
NF1, can be difficult (1). Sporadic MPNSTs are generally not
associated with preexisting neurofibromas and diagnosis is
mainly one of the exclusion. Strict criteria must be applied to
ensure diagnostic consistency and at least one of the following
conditions must be met: association with a peripheral nerve
and ultrastructural, histologic, and/or immunohistochemical
features characteristic of Schwannian differentiation. As
described earlier, germline NF1 deactivating mutations are
the hallmark of NF1-associated MPNSTs. Several studies have
identified somatic NF1 mutations to occur in a subset of
sporadic MPNSTs, although not uniformly (33). The exact
prevalence and importance of Nf1 loss in sporadic MPNST
tumorigenesis is currently unknown. Both cell lines studied
here were shown to retain expression of Nf1 protein (Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2). Further studies are needed to
determine the role of Nf1 loss in HDACi sensitivity. If such
a role is confirmed, it is possible that future treatment studies
for sporadic MPNST and other malignancies where somatic
NF1 mutations commonly occur would benefit from the use of
NF1 mutation status or protein expression as biomarkers for
patients stratification.
A major objective of this study was to identify potential
mechanisms of HDACi resistance. Such knowledge will facilitate appropriate patient selection for treatment and enhance
development of effective combination strategies to maximize
HDACI cytotoxic effects. Enhanced antioxidant expression
(34), retinoic acid signaling deregulation (35), and multidrug
resistance (34) are several potential molecular mechanisms

previously proposed as contributory to HDACi resistance. This
study highlights the potential role of autophagy as a mechanism of therapeutic resistance.
Described more than 50 years ago, interest in autophagy in
tumorigenesis and cancer progression has recently emerged,
suggesting a complex molecular and functional interplay (26,
36, 37). Autophagy activation has been reported in response to
diverse anticancer therapies (radiation, chemotherapy, targeted therapies; i.e., ER inhibitors and imatinib; refs. 26, 38). Of
note is that a large number of studies show autophagy
induction based on autophagosome accumulation and LC3
conversion; however, such findings can reflect either increased
autophagic activity (productive autophagy) or reduced turnover of autophagosomes and autophagy blockade (24). This
has major relevance to HDACis because of the recent finding
that HDAC6 controls autophagosome maturation and autophagosome–lysosome fusion, and that its inhibition might in
turn induce autophagy blockade (39). Taking this into
account, here we have utilized a large panel of assays to test
both autophagy steady state and flux, and have evaluated the
impact of a selective HDACi (MS-275), which does not block
HDAC6.
HDACi-induced autophagy has previously been described
(40). The impact of drug-induced autophagy is currently being
debated. Pro-death effects via a possible (albeit not yet fully
substantiated) autophagic death mechanism (programmed
cell-death type-II), or apoptosis enhancement have been
described (26). In contrast, pro-survival, antiapoptotic effects
have also been reported, consonant with a role for druginduced autophagy in tumor chemoresistance (37). For example, Shao et al. (41) found both apoptosis and autophagy to
occur in Henrietta Lacks cells in response to HDACis; apoptosis
blockade did not diminish therapeutic-induced cell death,
highlighting the role of autophagy and/or necrosis in this
process. Similarly, Hrzenjak and colleagues (42) observed that
HDACi treatment mediated autophagic, caspase-independent
cytotoxicity in endometrial sarcoma cells. In contrast, Carew
et al. (43) found that autophagy blockade significantly
enhanced HDACi-mediated apoptosis in chronic myelogenous
leukemia cells. These seemingly contradictory data suggest
that consequences of drug-induced autophagy may be compound-type, tumor-type, or even molecular context–dependent and depict a complex cross talk between autophagy and
apoptosis (44).
Our observations suggest that in MPNST HDACi-induced
autophagy increases cell survival by possibly opposing apoptosis and show that autophagy blockade enhances HDACi
proapoptotic effects. This occurs not only in cells resistant to
HDACi but also in MPNSTs showing relative sensitivity where
autophagy blockade further increases HDACi proapoptotic
effects. Chloroquine is known for its ability to block autophagy
and is currently being evaluated in human glioblastoma and
lung cancer clinical trials; initial studies already confirm its
safety (45). Our studies support the investigation of HDACi/
chloroquine combinations for MPNST treatment.
Currently, autophagy-specific inhibitors are lacking; consequently, the majority of studies, including ours, have been
conducted with pharmacologic agents with known off-target

effects beyond autophagy (46). Development of autophagyspecific inhibitors may help determine the role of autophagy
in cancer treatment and can form the basis for novel effective
therapeutic combinations. It is therefore pertinent to establish
an understanding about selective control of autophagy in
specific therapeutic contexts. Our studies have identified
and validated several molecular targets that potentially contribute to HDACi-induced autophagy in MPNST including
IRGM, CXCR4, and TMEM74. A role in autophagy was recently
attributed to the protein products of all 3 genes (see supplementary information; refs. 47–49). However, the mechanisms
by which they activate autophagy and possibly contribute to
drug-induced autophagy and chemoresistance are yet to be
fully elucidated. Accordingly, and as a proof of principle,
knockdown of IRGM was found to block HDACi-induced
autophagy and enhance apoptosis. Additional studies are
currently ongoing and will hopefully lead to findings of clinical
relevance. For example, CXCR4 inhibitors are available and are
undergoing human cancer clinical trials (50); pending further
supportive data HDACi/CXCR4 inhibitor therapeutic combinations could be evaluated as a novel approach for the
treatment of MPNST.

Correction: Autophagic Survival in Resistance
to Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors: Novel
Strategies to Treat Malignant Peripheral
Nerve Sheath Tumors
In this article (Cancer Res 2011;71:185–96), which appeared in the January 1, 2011,
issue of Cancer Research (1), there are several errors in the ﬁgures. As soon as they
became aware of these issues, for sake of accuracy, the authors repeated the related
experiments demonstrating the very same experimental results as the original
investigations. The corrected ﬁgures are as follows:
Figure 1D. This panel includes multiple Western blot analyses in which different cell
lines were treated with HDAC inhibitors demonstrating increase in histone and
tubulin acetylation. Actin loading controls of the S462 and STS26T cell line blots were
accidentally duplicated. All the panels for the S462 and STS26T cell lines have been
replaced with new data in the corrected ﬁgure below; all other Western blots in panel
D and the original data in panels A, B, and C remain the same.
Figure 3. There was a recurring typographical error in the marking of the Western
blots. Original data remain the same in panel A.
Figure 3B. Acridine orange staining FACS analysis histograms were erroneously
duplicated. The histograms for both STS26T and MPNST724 (DMSO and PCI) have
been replaced with new data; original data for the cell images remain the same.
Figures 3C and 4C. Actin loading controls of the bottom gels of Fig. 3C (in which
STS26T and MPNST724 cells were treated with PCI-24781, chloroquine or baﬁlomycin, or their combination) and those of Fig. 4C were erroneously duplicated.
For Fig. 3C, original data remain the same for the upper Western blots of STS26T and
MPNST724 treated with PCI, SAHA, MS-275. The lower Western blots of STS26T
(PCI and BFA) and MPNST724 (PCI and CQ) have been replaced with new data.
Figure 3D. The labels of the three Western blots using MPNST724 (LC3-GFP) have
been corrected; the data remain the same. Original data remain the same for the cell
images with LC3-GFP puncta and the bottom right Western blot of STS26T treated
with PCI (V, 2, 4, and 6 hours).
Figure 4D. The treatment for MPNST724 is chloroquine and not BFA, as was
originally indicated. The Western blots on the lower part of Fig. 4D have been
replaced with new data; the upper clonogenic images and graph are original data and
remain the same. Panels A, B, and C remain the same with original data.
The corrected ﬁgures appear below. These errors do not change either the results or the
conclusions of the article. The authors regret these errors.
