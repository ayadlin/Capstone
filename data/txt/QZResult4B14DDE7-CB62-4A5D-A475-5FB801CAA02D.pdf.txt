ABSTRACT:
Telomerase is crucial for the maintenance of stem/progenitor cells in adult
tissues and is detected in most malignant cancers, including osteosarcoma. However,
the relationship between telomerase expression and cancer stem cells remains
unknown. We observed that sphere-derived osteosarcoma cells had higher telomerase
activity, indicating that telomerase activity might be enriched in osteosarcoma stem
cells. We sorted subpopulations with high or low telomerase activity (TEL) using
hTERT transcriptional promoter-induced green fluorescent protein (GFP). The TELpos
cells showed an increased sphere and tumor propagating capacity compared to TELneg
cells, and enhanced stem cell-like properties such as invasiveness, metastatic activity
and resistance to chemotherapeutic agents both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore,
the telomerase inhibitor MST312 prevented tumorigenic potential both in vitro and in
vivo, preferentially targeting the TELpos cells. These data support telomerase inhibition
as a potential targeted therapy for osteosarcoma stem-like cells.

INTRODUCTION

significant heterogeneity with respect to tumorigenic and
metastatic potential [6, 7]. The biological basis underlying
this cellular heterogeneity has potential therapeutic
implications. In contrast to the stochastic model, the
cancer stem cell model predicts that heterogeneity within
a tumor is derived from a hierarchal organization [811]. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are thus thought to share
important properties with normal tissue stem cells such as
self-renewal and differentiation. In addition, cancer stem
cells have been proposed to be responsible for metastasis
and resistance to anticancer drugs [12, 13]. Therefore,
the inadequacy of current treatments may result from the
inability to effectively target the cancer stem cells within
osteosarcoma.
Properties of normal stem cells have been widely

Osteosarcoma is an extremely aggressive form of
bone cancer which has a peak incidence in the second
decade of life [1, 2]. Prior to systemic chemotherapy
amputation was the only choice of treatment, and the
high rate of pulmonary micrometastasis makes 5 year
survival very low [3]. For the last 4 decades, neoadjuvant
chemotherapy and limb salvage surgery have greatly
improved both the survival and life quality of the patient
[4]. However, despite intensive chemotherapy, the survival
rate for high-grade osteosarcoma has improved little and
almost 40% of osteosarcoma patients die of their disease
[5].

used to identify cancer stem cells. There are several
methods used to isolate osteosarcoma stem cells, including
cell surface markers [14, 15], Hoechst effluxing (SP)
[16], label retention (PKH26) [17], the Aldefluor assay
[18] and promoter reporter assays [19]. For example, the
mesenchymal stem cell markers CD117 and Stro-1 have
been successfully applied to isolate osteosarcoma initiating
cells associated with metastasis and drug resistance [14].
However, these methods have not identified a way to
target these tumorigenic cellular subpopulations.
Human telomerase is a reverse transcriptase
enzyme composed of a catalytic component, telomerase
reverse-transcriptase (TERT) and a telomerase RNA
component (TERC) [20]. In most human normal somatic
cells, telomerase activity is undetectable, however,
stem/progenitor cells in self-renewing tissues express
telomerase. In addition, telomerase activity is detected
in most malignant cancers, including osteosarcoma [21].
Given the important role of telomeres and telomerase
in stem cells and cancer [22-24], we predicted a high
expression of telomerase in cancer stem cells, and aimed
to investigate its role in the cancer stem cell phenotype.
To test this, we stably transduced osteosarcoma
cell lines with a lentiviral vector in which the human
TERT promoter drives expression of green fluorescent
protein (GFP). Based on high activity of the fluorescent
reporter, we isolated a distinct subpopulation of cells with
tumor-initiating properties from the human osteosarcoma
cell lines. These cells show high drug-resistant and
metastatic properties, and furthermore we demonstrate
that telomerase inhibition is effective for eradicating these
osteosarcoma stem-like cells.

an average fold change of 3.47±1.10 (P<0.01) (Fig. 1B).

RESULTS

Osteosarcoma cells with high telomerase promoter
activity express cancer stem cell markers and
related genes

A subset of osteosarcoma cells can activate an
exogenous hTERT Promoter and GFP expression
In order to perform live tracing of the telomerase
activity, we constructed a lentiviral hTERTpromoter-GFP
reporter vector with a puromycin selection cassette, and
established osteosarcoma cell lines stably expressing
the hTERT promoter reporter. To assess the validity of
the lentivirus, we used both a transcriptionally inactive
negative control virus and a transcriptionally active
positive control virus (Fig. 1C). The negative control
group had no GFP positive cells, which demonstrates the
specificity of the cloned hTERT promoter reporter. The
positive control vector, without puromycin selection,
demonstrated high numbers of GFP positive cells
implying that the osteosarcoma cell lines are easily
infected by this lentiviral vector. We found that only a
subset of osteosarcoma cells can activate the exogenous
hTERT promoter and express GFP (Fig. 1C). The GFP
positive portion of MG63, MNNG/HOS and 143B was
23.24±3.88, 15.51±2.79 and 22.44±2.74, respectively. We
then asked whether hTERT transcription activity correlates
with hTERT mRNA and telomerase activity in human
osteosarcoma cell lines. We divided the osteosarcoma cells
into GFP-pos and GFP-neg groups according to their GFP
expression, and found that both the telomerase activity and
hTERT mRNA levels were higher in the GFP-pos cells,
with the average fold increase of 3.42±0.89 (P<0.01) and
3.29±0.45 (P<0.01), respectively (Fig. 1D-E).

Osteosarcoma sphere cells are enriched for high
telomerase activity

Next, we separated three osteosarcoma cell lines
into TELpos and TELneg subpopulations according to their
GFP expression status in order to compare their stem celllike properties. CD117 and Stro-1 are linked to cancer
stem cells with metastatic and drug resistant properties
in osteosarcoma [14], therefore we investigated if TELpos
cells were enriched with cells expressing these markers.
The CD117 and Stro-1 double positive rate for MG63,
MNNG/HOS and 143B TELpos cells were 5.62±0.75,
6.24±0.09 and 8.27±0.41, respectively. Across the three
cell lines tested, we observed an average of 4.51±0.55 fold
higher of double positive cells in TELpos cells compared
with TELneg cells (P<0.01) (Fig. 2A-B). As a control, the
Stro-1 and CD117 status of the non-transduced parental
MG63 cells was also assessed (Supplementary Fig.1A).
CSCs are reported to possess a transcriptional profile
similar to that of embryonic stem cells (ES cells) [19],
therefore we investigated if there is differential expression
of these genes between TELpos and TELneg cells. We

A proportion of osteosarcoma cells are capable of
forming spheres when cultured in a serum free, anchorageindependent environment [25]. Spheres show high levels
of staining for the osteosarcoma stem cell markers Stro1 and CD117, and sphere-forming cells have greater
capacity to initiate tumors, which supports their increased
stem cell content [14]. To test whether stem cells have
higher telomerase activity, we used the TRAP-ELISA
assay and analysed hTERT mRNA expression levels in the
cells in different culture conditions. We found telomerase
activity to be much higher in sphere cultured cells than
monolayer cultured cells both in osteosarcoma cell lines
and primary osteosarcoma cells, with an average fold
change of 3.15±0.34 (P<0.01) (Fig. 1A). In accordance
with the telomerase activity, expression of hTERT mRNA
was also upregulated under sphere culture condition, with

GFP-positive cells, whereas Nanog was expressed in

form sphere colonies in suspension and whether they selfrenew in secondary culture. We compared the ability of
TELpos and TELneg cells to form primary and secondary
sarcospheres. TELpos cells formed more sarcospheres than
TELneg cells, with an average fold increase of 3.8±0.9
(Fig. 2D). Significantly, when dissociated sphere cells
were plated for a second generation of sphere culture,
self-renewal from TELneg spheres was almost depleted,
whereas cells from spheres grown from TELpos cells
underwent self-renewal very efficiently (Fig.2E).
The most stringent test of CSC activity is their
ability to initiate tumors. We therefore subcutaneously

injected serial dilutions of TELpos and TELneg MG63 cells
into immunocompromised mice and examined the rate of
tumor formation over a period of 6 months. As shown in
Table 1, the majority of mice (7/8) injected with 5,000
TELpos cells formed tumors, whereas only one in 8 mice
injected with 5×104 TELneg cells showed tumor formation.
The extreme limiting dilution assay (ELDA) calculation
estimated a 374-fold increase in cancer stem cell frequency
in TELpos compared to TELneg cells (Fig. 3A; Table 1).
Tumors were further analysed by histological examination,
and expression of vimentin indicated their mesenchymal
origin (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, we isolated TELpos cells
from two different MG63 derived tumors and serially
transplanted these into further mice. Tumor formation
was observed in 83.3% (5/6) of mice (n = 6) injected with
5,000 cells (Fig. 3C). Serial transplantability of TELpos
cells confirmed their in vivo self-renewal activity. We next
tested the ability of TELpos cells to initiate osteosarcomas
in the bone niche using MNNG/HOS cells. Mice were
injected orthotopically into the tibia with TELpos or TELneg

cells. 6 out of 8 mice injected with 5,000 TELpos cells
formed tumors, whereas no tumours were formed in mice
injected with TELneg cells, even when 5×104 cells were
injected. ELDA analysis indicated a 232-fold increase in
tumour-initiating cell frequencies in TELpos compared to
TELneg cells (Fig. 3D; Table 1).

Osteosarcoma cells with high telomerase activity
have multipotency
Many cancer stem cell types possess the capability
of multipotent differentiation [14, 26]. We demonstrated
that cells recovered from TELpos xenograft tumors could be
re-sorted into GFP-enriched and non-GFP subpopulations
(Fig. 4A). This implies that TELpos cells can differentiate
into TELneg cells in vivo, and was confirmed in a TELposderived tumor section, where both GFP-positive and GFPnegative cells were observed. To exclude the possibility
of contamination from mouse derived-tissue, xenograft
tumors were stained with anti-human MHC class I

Antibody (Santa Cruz sc-32235), which does not crossreact with mouse tissue. It was found that almost 100%
of the cells stained positive, indicating that they were
human-derived (Fig. 4B). We also observed that a single
TELpos cell could form a sarcosphere colony consisting of
TELpos and TELneg cells, suggesting in vitro differentiation
of TELpos cells into TELneg cells (Fig.4C).
It is not common to see the differentiation of regular
osteosarcoma cells along osteogenic or adipogenic
lineage, and therefore this method can be used to test the
multipotency of osteosarcoma stem cells. We observed
that TELpos cells were able to undergo osteogenic and

adipogenic differentiation in vitro, whilst TELneg
cells could not be induced along these lineages. These
data indicate the multipotency of TELpos cells (Fig. 4D,
Supplementary Fig.1B).

Osteosarcoma cells with high telomerase activity
show increased invasion in vitro, metastasis in vivo
and drug resistance
We performed a Matrigel Transwell invasion assay
to evaluate the invasive properties of different cells in
vitro. TELpos cells showed a nearly 3-fold higher invasive
potential compared with that of TELneg cells (Fig. 5A). To
investigate the metastatic potential of TELpos and TELneg
cells, we used the 143B cell line due to its relatively high
tendency to metastasise in vivo. We orthotopically injected
1x105 143B cells and the development of pulmonary
metastasis was monitored by X-ray detection. Overall, the
mice showed a 75% (6/8) appearance rate of lung nodules
following TELpos cells injection, whereas none of the
TELneg injected mice showed obvious lung nodules (Fig.
5B). We also quantified micrometastatic lesions by serial
lung section (Fig.5C), which further confirmed the higher
metastatic potential of TELpos cells than TELneg cells .
We next examined whether telomerase active cells
could survive current treatments, such as doxorubicin,
which is one of the most widely used reagents for
osteosarcoma chemotherapy. We found that in all three
cell lines TELpos cells showed a higher resistance to
doxorubicin than TELneg cells (Fig. 5D).

Next, we tested whether the telomerase inhibitor
MST312 targets the osteosarcoma cells in vitro. We
divided the cells into TELpos and TELneg subgroups and
treated with MST312 for 96h. We found a decrease in
the cell viability of both subgroups, but a significantly
greater inhibitory effect was observed in TELpos cells (Fig.
6A). Furthermore, we found that MST312 inhibited in
vitro sphere formation of TELpos cells, with an average

were then subcutaneously injected into nude mice, and
the mice were treated with MST312. After 3 weeks the

tumors in control mice were ~ 1cm3, while tumours in the
MST312 treated mice were 5-fold smaller (Fig. 6C). We
then analysed MG63-TELpos derived tumors treated with

reported to predict the outcome of osteosarcoma [27].
We thus proposed to use telomerase activity to isolate
osteosarcoma stem cells.
First, we asked whether there was differential
activity of telomerase between osteosarcoma stem cells
and non-stem cells. Using anchorage-independent, serumstarved culture conditions, a subpopulation of cells capable
of self-renewal can be enriched as spherical clones, termed

CSCs share many properties with normal stem cells,
which are known to express telomerase. Telomerase is
also found in 90% of human malignancies and has been

sarcospheres [25]. We found that telomerase activity
was markedly enhanced in sarcospheres compared to
monolayer cells. This also applied to primary cells from
telomerase-expressing osteosarcoma. These data support
the theory that telomerase activity can be used to isolate
osteosarcoma stem cells. We therefore used a hTERT
promoter-GFP lentiviral reporter and established the
stable reporter cell lines to assess the cellular telomerase
activity. We confirmed that in the three cell lines used the
cells can be divided into two subpopulations according to
the hTERT promoter activity, which strongly correlated
with the expression of the hTERT mRNA and telomerase
activity. This enrichment was also observed in four
primary telomerase-positive osteosarcomas.
We then tested whether hTERT promoter active
cells possess CSC activities such as self-renewal and in
vivo transplantation, and if our putative CSCs overlapped
with other identified CSC populations in osteosarcoma.
The TELpos cells possessed a much stronger capacity to
form spheroids than TELneg cells. This ability was not
compromised after serial passage, which implies the
property of self-renewal. Cell surface markers such as
CD117 and Stro-1 have previously been successfully
used in isolating osteosarcoma stem cells, and we
assessed expression of these in TELpos cells. Phenotypic
characterization of TELpos cells showed that they
selectively expressed CD117 and Stro-1. Previous studies
have reported that ES cell genes play a crucial role in
CSCs [29, 30] and TELpos cells were found to overexpress
both embryonic stem cell (ES cell)-specific transcription

factors Oct4 and Sox2, although Nanog was expressed in
both TELpos and TELneg cells without significant difference.
Using a limiting dilution xenograft assay, we
confirmed that the sub-population capable of activating
the hTERTpromoter/GFP reporter exhibited significantly
enhanced tumorigenic activity in vivo. Following either
orthotopic or ectopic transplantation, these TELpos cells
consistently formed tumors at a lower number of injected
cells, and these tumors were able to initiate new tumors
after serial transplantation. A further key property of
cancer stem cells is the ability to give rise to heterogeneous
tumors comprised of tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic
cell populations. TELpos cells differentiated toward several
mesenchymal phenotypes in vitro, including osteogenic
and adipogenic differentiation. Furthermore, TELposcells
could produce GFP negative cells both in vitro and in
vivo, providing evidence that these cells can give rise to
phenotypically diverse progeny.
CSCs have been shown to be more capable of
metastasis [31, 32]. Previous research has demonstrated
CD117+Stro-1+ osteosarcoma cells to be highly metastatic
and enriched for a metastasis-associated marker CXCR4
[14]. In addition, it has been shown that osteosarcoma cells
capable of activating a transgenic Oct-4 promoter were
more likely to form metastases in the lung [19]. Consistent
with these studies, our study established that TELpos cells
had higher invasive and metastatic properties compared
to TELneg cells, in vitro and in vivo, respectively. TERT
has been reported to promote epithelial-mesenchymal
transition in gastric cancer cells [33]. It is thus feasible

that TELpos osteosarcoma could utilise EMT-related genes
to promote metastasis.
Many factors contribute to the drug resistance of
CSCs [34, 35]. We found that TELpos cells exhibited a
higher resistance to doxorubicin treatment, demonstrating
their drug-resistant capability. Doxorubicin’s mechanism
of action is via intercalating DNA, causing DDR (DNA
damage response) and activating apoptosis [36, 37]. There
is increasing evidence that telomerase also participates in
DNA repair, and this effect is independent of telomere
elongation [38-40]. We speculate that high hTERT
expression confers cells with enhanced DNA repair
capacity, which results in resistance to doxorubicin.
Different strategies targeting telomerase are
currently being tested in several cancers, including
osteosarcoma [41, 42]. However, few studies have
analyzed whether these therapies are preferentially
effective in CSCs. MST312 is a small molecule that
has emerged as a promising candidate for anti-telomeric
therapy, and it has been reported to be effective in ALDH+
lung cancer stem cells [43, 44]. In our study, we have
shown that MST312 has a stronger inhibitory effect on
TELpos than TELneg cells. It can inhibit sphere formation
in vitro and hinder the in vivo tumor formation of TELpos
cells, and it decreases the percentage of TELpos cells in
xenografted tumors. These findings provide evidence
that a telomerase inhibitor can be preferentially effective
in CSCs. It is reported that TERT promotes epithelial
proliferation through Myc- and Wnt-related pathways
[45], and the Wnt pathway has also been shown to be
involved in osteosarcoma pathogenesis [46, 47]. Due to
the facts that (i): The MST312 dose used in this study was
nontoxic [44]; and (ii): the short duration of treatment,
we believe that the effects observed here are mostly
due to inhibition of proliferation and self-renewal, and
independent of telomere-maintenance.
In contrast to methods using cell surface markers,
we found that TELpos cells appear to constitute a relatively
large proportion in the tumor mass. This is in accordance
with previous research in which osteosarcoma stem cells
were isolated using an Oct4/GFP reporter [19]. These
data suggest that osteosarcoma contain a large percentage
of tumor-initiating cells. Osteosarcoma presents as
pleomorphic, malignant, spindle cells that secrete osteoid
and express surface antigens commonly associated with
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), such as CD29, CD44,
CD56, CD90 and CD105 [48]. Given these observations,
it is likely that osteosarcoma is derived from mesenchymal
stem cells. However, it is reported that mesenchymal stem
cell have no or very low levels of telomerase activity [50].
In addition, osteosarcoma cell lines such as U2OS and
Saos2 [51] and 2/3 of clinical osteosarcoma are telomerase
negative [27, 52]. It is thus reasonable that our strategy
might not be suitable for those patients where telomerase
activity and hTERT expression are undetectable.
Our study is the first to show that osteosarcomas
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

contain a subpopulation of cells identified by high
telomerase activity, which possess stem cell-like properties
including self-renewal, multi-potency, pulmonary
metastatic potential and drug resistance. Further, this study
identifies telomerase inhibition as a potential candidate for
osteosarcoma stem cell-targeted therapy, which could help
to solve the most lethal characteristics of osteosarcoma—
recurrence, metastasis and chemotherapy resistance.

METHODS
Primary osteosarcoma cells and cell lines
Primary osteosarcoma samples were retrieved from
four patients with conventional high-grade osteosarcoma,
and were confirmed to be telomerase expressing. Primary
osteosarcoma cell lines (OS1-4) were established from
tumor lesions taken from surgical biopsies. All the
samples were obtained with informed consent, and
the study protocol was approved by the institutional
review board of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University.
None of specimens had been exposed to chemotherapy
or radiotherapy, the diagnosis was confirmed by the
histological analysis, and the clinicopathological features
are described in Supplementary Table 1. Tumor tissues
were processed directly after biopsy. In brief, tumors were
washed, cut into small pieces and digested at 37°C with
0.25% trypsin and 0.1% type II collagenase for 30 min and
2 h, respectively. Cells isolated after digestion were plated
out into subsequent culture. The telomerase expressing
human osteosarcoma cell lines MG63 and MNNG/HOS
were purchased from the Shanghai Institute for Biological
Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. 143B was
obtained from China Center for Type Culture Collection
(CCTCC). All the cells were cultured in RPMI-1640
containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
Cells were propagated in a humidified environment at
37˚C with 5% CO2 and 100% humidity. Cell viability was
determined using trypan blue staining.

Generation of hTERT-GFP reporter osteosarcoma
cell line
The hTERT promoter region (1.5 kb) [53-55]was
synthesized and cloned into the multiple cloning site of
the lentiviral transcriptional reporter vector pGreenFire1mCMV-EF1-Puro (TR010PA-P; System Biosciences,
Mountain View, CA), with ClaI and EcoRI recognistion
site on 5’ and 3’ end, respectively. The promoter region
sequence was confirmed by Shanghai Sangon Biotech Co.
Ltd. We transfected HEK293-T cells with the constructs
and obtained the viral supernatants. To generate stably
expressing reporter cell lines, we infected osteosarcoma
cells with the viral supernatant and selected the cells with

puromycin (5μg/ml) for one week. The transcriptionally
inactive pGreenFire-mCMV (TR010PA-P) was used
as a negative control and the transcriptionally active
pGreenFire-CMV (TR011PA-1) was used as a positive
control.

for 24 hours. Cell viability was measured by CCK8 assay.

Matrigel invasion assay
In vitro invasion assays were performed in transwell
chambers (Costar, Cambridge, MA). The upper side of the
porous polycarbonate membrane (8.0 µm pore size) was
coated with 10 µg/cm2 reconstituted Matrigel basement
membrane (Sigma). Cells (2×105/well) were seeded on
the upper side of the filter and incubated in RPMI-1640
medium with 0.5% FBS. The lower chamber was filled
with complete culture medium containing 10% FBS. After
24h, cells migrated to the lower side were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal violet.
The filters were photographed and cells were counted.

FACScan analysis and sorting
The hTERT-GFP reporter osteosarcoma cells were
harvested with fresh 0.25% trypsin solution (SigmaAldrich, Inc.) and resuspended in PBS. Cells were
maintained on ice until analysis. The GFP expression
was assessed and cells were sorted into TELpos and TELneg
subpopulation according to their GFP expression status,
using a Becton-Dickinson FACSort (San Jose, CA,
USA). For analysis of cell surface markers, the cells were
harvested and resuspended in PBS/0.5% normal rabbit
serum (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.), and blocked on ice for 15
min. Cells were subsequently labelled with Alexa Fluor®
647 anti-human Stro-1 antibody (BioLegend) and/or PE
anti-human CD117 (c-kit) antibody (BioLegend) for 60
min and maintained on ice until analysis. The expression
was assessed by flow cytometry and data were analyzed
using WinMDI software (Scripps Research Institute, La
Jolla, CA, USA).

Tumor spheroid assay
The sphere formation assay followed procedures
previously described [25]. In brief, cells were plated
in six-well ultralow attachment plates (Corning Inc.,
Corning, NY) at a density of 5,000 cells/well in RPMI1640 supplemented with B27 Supplement (Invitrogen),
10 ng/mL human EGF (Sigma-Aldrich), and 10 ng/mL
human bFGF (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were incubated at
37˚C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2.
Fresh aliquots of EGF and bFGF were added every other
day. After culture for 14 days, colonies larger than 50 μm
in size were regarded as sarcospheres and quantitated by
inverted phase contrast microscopy. The spheres were
processed to form the next generation of spheres every
14 days.

TRAP-ELISA assay
Telomerase activity was determined using the
TeloTAGGG PCR ELISAPLUS kit (Roche, Mannheim,
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In
brief, cells were cultured in monolayer or sphere condition
for 14 days and then harvested. 2×105 cells per sample
were lysed in 200 μL lysis buffer, and 2 μL cell extract
was used for the TRAP reaction. Telomeric repeats were
added to biotinylated synthetic primers by telomerase,
the elongation product was then amplified by PCR. PCR
products were then immobilized to a streptavidin-coated
microplate. The immobilized PCR products were detected
by an anti-digoxigenin antibody, and then visualized by
peroxidase. The absorbance of the samples was measured
at 450 nm. Heat-treated cell extract was used as the
negative control. A template DNA with the same sequence
as a telomerase product with 8 telomeric repeats was used
as a positive control. Relative telomerase activities (RTA)
were calculated according to protocol.

Animals and transplantation Assay
To determine the in vivo tumorigenicity, BALB/C
nude mice about 6 weeks old were purchased and
maintained at the Wuhan University Center for Animal
Experiment. The care and use of animals has been
reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (IACUC) (approval number:
2011006). After sorting by FACS, live cells were counted
by trypan blue staining, and suspended in 10μL of 50%
Matrigel/PBS. The mice were randomly divided according
to their injected cells and site. Tumors were grown by
subcutaneous (MG63) or orthotopic (MNNG/HOS)
inoculation with 5 × 103 to 5 × 105 cells. Tumor onset was
set at 5 mm diameter, mice were monitored as long as 6
months.
To evaluate the potential to metastasise, we
performed orthotopic injections of 143B cells. 1×105 cells
in 10μL of 50% Matrigel/PBS were injected into femoral
bone marrow cavities of anesthetized BALB/C nude
mice. Mice were monitored until 90 days after injection

Drug sensitivity assessment
Osteosarcoma cells (TELpos and TELneg) were
cultured for 2 days in complete media to allow cells to
recover from sorting stress. Cells (5,000 per well) were
cultured in 96-well plates for 1 day and then treated with
increasing concentrations of doxorubicin (0-10.0 μmol/L)

or until tumors reached 10 mm in diameter. At the end of
observation point, the mice were anesthetized and X-ray
images were taken to detect pulmonary metastases using
the KODAK Digital Radiography System. The mice were
then sacrificed. Tumor and lung samples were fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Tissue
sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin.
Data were accumulated from at least three independent
experiments.

and developed using ECL Substrate. Densitometry was
performed using Image J software.

Testing the efficiency of telomerase inhibitor
MST312
Osteosarcoma cell lines were sorted and cultured
as described above. The monolayer cultured cells were
treated with MST312 for 72 h, with a final concentration
of 1µM MST312. For sphere culture, fresh medium
with MST312 was used every 3 days, and cultured for
14 days. Xenotransplatation assay was carried out as
described above, and 5 × 106 MG63 cells were injected
subcutaneously into the flanks of the mice. A total of 8
mice were randomly divided into control (no treatment)
and MST312-treated groups, with 4 in each. The MST312
was administered by intraperitoneal injection (40 mg/kg)
every other day, starting after injection. Tumor volume
was measured every 3-4 days according to the formula:
V = length × (width)2/2. All mice were sacrificed 21
days after cell injection and tissues were kept for FACS
analysis.

Differentiation
Osteosarcoma cells were plated in 96-well plates.
When cells reached confluency, they were cultured in
osteogenic differentiation media for 3 weeks and then
stained by alizarin red. For adipogenic differentiation, the
cells were cultured in differentiation medium for 5 days.
Cells were then fixed with 10% buffered formalin and
stained with Oil Red O.

Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed.
Real-time PCR was then performed using an ABI
7900 System in the presence of SYBR- Green.
The following gene-specific primers were used:
hTERT
(5’
GGAGCAAGTTGCAAAGCATTG
-3’,
5’-TCCCACGACGTAGTCCATGTT-3’)
and
GAPDH
(5’ AGAAGGCTGGGGCTCATTTG-3’,
5’-AGGGGCCATCCACAGTCTTC-3’). Target sequences
were amplified at 95˚C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles
of 95˚C for 15 s and 60˚C for 1 min. GAPDH was used
as endogenous normalization control. All assays were
performed in triplicate. The fold change in mRNAs
expression was determined according to the method of
2ΔΔCt.

Statistical analyses
Each experiment was performed independently
at least three times. Fisher’s Exact Test (one-sided) was
used to determine the statistical significance of in vivo
tumorigenesis. Otherwise, values were expressed as
mean ± SD, and statistical significance (P < 0.05) was
determined using Student’s t test.
