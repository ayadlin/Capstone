The Human TLR Innate Immune Gene Family Is Differentially
Inﬂuenced by DNA Stress and p53 Status in Cancer Cells
Maria Shatz, Daniel Menendez, and Michael A. Resnick

Abstract
The transcription factor p53 regulates genes associated with a wide range of functions, including the Toll-like
receptor (TLR) set of innate immunity genes, suggesting that p53 also modulates the human immune response.
The TLR family comprises membrane glycoproteins that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns
(PAMP) and mediate innate immune responses, and TLR agonists are being used as adjuvants in cancer
treatments. Here, we show that doxorubicin, 5-ﬂuorouracil, and UV and ionizing radiation elicit changes in TLR
expression that are cell line- and damage-speciﬁc. Speciﬁcally, treatment-induced expression changes led to
increased downstream cytokine expression in response to ligand stimulation. The effect of DNA stressors on TLR
expression was mainly mediated by p53, and several p53 cancer-associated mutants dramatically altered the
pattern of TLR gene expression. In all cell lines tested, TLR3 induction was p53-dependent, whereas induction
of TLR9, the most stress-responsive family member, was less dependent on status of p53. In addition, each of
the 10 members of the innate immune TLR gene family tested was differentially inducible. Our ﬁndings therefore
show that the matrix of p53 status, chromosome stress, and responsiveness of individual TLRs should be
considered in TLR-based cancer therapies. Cancer Res; 72(16); 3948–57. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
The p53 tumor suppressor is a master regulatory transcriptional factor activated in response to several stress signals
including DNA damage, resulting in transactivation of target
genes. It functions in a variety of biologic processes including
cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, embryo implantation,
and nutritional stress (1). p53 binds in vitro as a tetramer to a
DNA motif composed of 2 RRRCWWGYYY decamer half-sites
(R ¼ A, G; W ¼ A, T; and Y ¼ C, T) separated by a spacer of up to
14 bases (2). Using a combination of yeast and human cell
systems (3), we established "rules" whereby p53 was also found
to function from noncanonical sequences comprising only a
decamer 1/2-site or a 3/4-site (4–6). Using these rules for p53
binding and transactivation, we recently identiﬁed p53binding sites in the promoter region of most human Toll-like
receptors (TLR) and showed a direct role for p53 in regulation
of this entire family of genes in primary human immune
cells (7).

TLRs are a group of highly conserved integral membrane
glycoproteins that recognize a variety of distinct pathogenassociated molecular patterns (PAMP; ref. 8). The recognition
of PAMPs by TLR-expressing cells leads to quick and acute
responses required to eliminate pathogens in the host. Upon
ligand stimulation, TLRs recruit adaptor molecules MyD88,
TIRAP, TRIF, and TRAM leading to activation of NF-kB, interferon responsive factors, and mitogen-activated protein kinases
that, in turn, results in ligand-dependent patterns of gene
expression including inﬂammatory cytokines, chemokines, and
interferons (reviewed in ref. 8). In addition, endogenously produced ligands, referred to as damage-associated molecular
patterns (DAMP) or alarmins that include self-DNA and intracellular proteins, signal tissue injury through TLRs when DAMPs
are released from cells (9). In both cases TLR pathway activation
mediates immune/inﬂammatory responses. Ten TLRs (TLR1–
10) have been identiﬁed in humans. TLRs are expressed in
several types of immune cells including spleen, T and B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages (10). In addition,
TLRs function in nonimmune tissues such as airway and gut
epithelial cells which have direct contact with pathogens (11, 12).
Altered TLR expression has been associated with autoimmune and chronic inﬂammatory diseases including atherosclerosis, type I diabetes, inﬂammatory bowel disease, liver
diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (13, 14). In recent years, cancer-related functions of the
human TLR gene family have become apparent. Impaired
expression and signaling by TLR7 and TLR9 may contribute
to reduced innate immune responses during chronic viral
infections and oncogenesis (15). In addition, the loss-offunction allele Asp299Gly of TLR4 is associated with breast
cancer (16).

p53 Regulates TLR Gene Expression in Cancer Cells

For cancer cells expressing TLRs, activation of the pathway
can negatively affect growth and viability (17) including direct
killing of tumor cells via induction of TNFa (18, 19) and,
therefore, can be used in treatment. For instance, TLR7 agonist
imiquimod is used in treating basal cell and cutaneous malignancies; also, synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides containing
unmethylated CpG motifs that activate TLR9 are in clinical
trials (20, 21). Stimulation of the TLR pathway in antigenpresenting cells can induce and potentiate an effective
immune response against tumor cells (22–25). In addition,
TLR ligands conjugated to tumor-derived proteins or immunogenic peptides are used for therapeutic vaccination to treat
cancer (reviewed in ref. 26).
Surprisingly, despite the importance of TLRs in human health,
disease, and therapy, relatively little is known about their
transcriptional regulation. Only a few studies suggest involvement of transcriptional factors such as PU.1, activator protein,
interferon response factors, and Forkhead Box P3 in regulation
of speciﬁc TLRs in deﬁned cellular systems (27, 28).
Because we have shown in primary cells that activated p53
can regulate expression of the various TLRs differentially,
depending in part on the agent, the p53 status could inﬂuence
expression and function of TLRs in cancer cells (7). The TP53
gene is mutated in over half of human tumors (29, 30). Most
mutations are missense and are found within the central core
DNA-binding domain of the protein resulting in loss of transcriptional function. However, approximately one-third of
cancer-associated p53 mutants retain transactivation capability and exhibit change-in-spectrum of transactivated genes
(4, 5). Therefore, differential effects on TLR gene expression
might be expected from the various p53 mutations.
So far, only TLR3 was shown to be a p53 target (31). On the
basis of our results with primary human cells where nearly all
TLR genes are in the p53 network, we have investigated p53dependent regulation of the entire TLR gene family in a panel of
cancer cell lines and the consequences of p53 mutations on
TLR expression. We focused on human cells because there are
signiﬁcant differences in regulation, expression, and speciﬁcity
of TLRs between humans and rodents (reviewed in ref. 32),
especially as relates to p53 responsiveness (7). Here, we establish that most TLR genes are responsive to p53 and genotoxic
stress in human cancer cells. The considerable variability in
responses of speciﬁc TLR genes that is dependent on cell line,
speciﬁc p53 mutations, and stressors underscores the importance of considering these factors in TLR-based cancer
treatments.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and antibodies
All reagents were from Sigma unless stated otherwise. The
primary antibodies used were against p53 (DO-1), TLR5 (H127), actin (C-11), b-tubulin (H-300), and lamin B1 (H-90; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), p21 (SXM30, BD Biosciences Pharmigen),
TLR2 (#2229, Cell Signaling).
Cell lines and treatments
The source and maintenance conditions of cell lines are

indicated, cells were treated for 24 to 48 hours with the
following: Nutlin-3 (10 mmol/L), doxorubicin (0.3–0.6 mg/mL),
5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU, 300 mmol/L). For ionizing radiation (IR)
treatment and UV, cells were irradiated at 1.56 Gy/min or UV at
1 J/m2/s, respectively. Pretreatment with the p53 inhibitor
piﬁthrin-a (40 mmol/L) was for 4 hours. Doses of IR, UV,
doxorubicin, and Nutlin-3 were chosen based on preliminary
optimization as shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. None of the
treatments resulted in noticeable cell death during the course
of the experiments, based on visual observation.
Plasmid constructs, transfections, luciferase assays and
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, immunoblot,
and gene expression analysis by real-time PCR were carried out
as previously described (7). For details see Supplementary
Materials and Methods.

Results
p53 modulates expression of TLR genes in breast
adenocarcinoma and osteosarcoma cells
The impact of changes in p53 protein levels on TLR gene
expression was examined in several cancer cell lines.
Increases were accomplished using the p53 inducer Nutlin3 or p53 overexpression. Nutlin-3 inhibits p53 interaction with
its ubiquitin ligase MDM2 leading to p53 stabilization and
accumulation (33). The p53 inhibitor piﬁthrin-a or RNA
interference were used to reduce p53-mediated activity.
Although piﬁthrin-a can suppress p53-mediated transactivation, the underlying mechanism of p53 inhibition remains to
be established (34).
Shown in Fig. 1A are representative Western blot analysis of
p53 and p21 proteins in MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma cells
(wild-type p53) and an MCF7 cell line stably expressing shRNAi
to p53 (designated as "vector" and "p53i", respectively) treated
with Nutlin-3 or vehicle control dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for
48 hours. As expected, Nutlin-3 greatly increased expression of
p53 and its target gene p21 in MCF7-vector cells and only to a
small extent in MCF7-p53i cells (less than the basal level of p53
in the MCF7-vector cells). Nutlin-induced changes in expression of TLR genes in MCF7-vector and MCF7-p53i cells are
presented in Fig. 1B. Expression of only 3 of the 10 TLR genes
was detected in MCF7 cells under our experimental conditions: TLR2, 5, and 6. The TLR genes TLR2, 5, and 6 were induced
3.5- to 6-fold by Nutlin-3 compared with DMSO-treated
control in a p53-dependent manner in MCF7 cells. There was
a corresponding increase in TLR2 and TLR5 proteins in the
membrane fraction of the MCF7-vector cell lysate following
Nutlin-3 treatment (a reliable human TLR6 antibody was not
available) as described in Fig. 1C.
In contrast to MCF7 cells, all TLRs except TLR8 are
expressed in the osteosarcoma cell line U2OS (p53þ) and most
TLRs were induced by Nutlin increases in p53 (see p53 and p21
proteins in Fig. 1D). There was a 2- to 6.5-fold increase in
expression of TLR2, 3, 5, 6, 9, and 10 genes by 24 hours Nutlin-3
treatment compared with the DMSO-treated control in U2OS
cells (Fig. 1E). This induction was prevented by pretreatment
with piﬁthrin-a, conﬁrming a speciﬁc role for p53 in TLR gene
expression.

Figure 1. The p53 activator Nutlin-3 induces expression of TLR genes. MCF7-vector or MCF7-p53i cells were incubated with 10 mmol/L of Nutlin-3 or 0.1%
DMSO for 48 hours. Following treatment, cells were harvested and total RNA and protein were isolated. A, p53 and p21 activation were assessed by Western
blot analysis. The exposure was extended long enough to allow visualization of and direct comparison between all samples. Actin was used as a loading
control. B, expression of TLRs 2, 5, 6, and p21 following Nutlin-3 treatment was assessed using real-time PCR and normalized to expression of the
housekeeping gene GUSB. Expression of each gene in DMSO-treated control cells was set as one. C, cell lysates were subjected to subcellular fractionation
and 100 mg of protein from each membrane fraction was resolved by SDS-PAGE. Protein levels of TLR2 and TLR5 were detected by Western blotting; gel
staining was used for the loading control. D, p53 and p21 induction in U2OS cells following 24 hours of incubation with Nutlin-3 was assessed by
Western blot analysis. E, TLR gene expression in U2OS cells incubated with either Nutlin-3, piﬁthrin-a, a combination of both for 24 hours relative to
DMSO-treated control was assessed by real-time PCR. F, SaOS2 cells were transfected either with empty vector or with wild p53 or left untreated. Expression
levels of p53 and p21 were examined by Western blotting 24 hours posttransfection. G, TLRs mRNA expression levels following this transfection or Nutlin-3
(10 mmol/L, 24 hours) treatment were examined by qPCR; p21 was used as a positive control. Gene expression in DMSO-treated sample was set as one.
Shown are averages of 3 independent experiments. WT, wild-type.

Functional evaluation of proposed p53 response
elements in TLR promoters
On the basis of rules for functional p53 binding, we identiﬁed
several canonical and noncanonical p53-response elements
(RE) located in the promoter vicinity of almost all human TLR
genes (summarized in ref. 7; and Supplementary Table S1).
Luciferase reporter constructs containing selected response
elements from TLR promoter areas were transfected into
SaOS2 cells in the presence (solid bars) or absence (open bars)
of a vector expressing wild-type p53 and reporter induction
was assessed 48 hours posttransfection. Consistent with our
previous report, all proposed p53-RE sequences from the TLRs
could support p53-driven transcription of a luciferase reporter.
For most the levels induced were similar to the moderately
responsive p53 target response element of p53-regulated apoptosis-inducing protein 1 (TP53AIP1), which was used as an
internal control (Fig. 2A).
The ability of several of these p53-REs to function as p53
target sequences was investigated further using ChIP assays of
MCF7 cells treated for 24 hours with Nutlin-3 or doxorubicin,
another well-established activator of p53. The p53 occupancy
at the TLR promoters was assessed by ChIP analysis and
quantiﬁed by SYBR Green qPCR, as described in Fig. 2B and
Supplementary Fig. S1. The PCR reaction speciﬁcity was
conﬁrmed using product dissociation curve analysis and by
visualization of PCR product on ethidium bromide–stained
gels (Supplementary Fig. S2). Binding to the glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) promoter or a region in
the TLR5 promoter distant from the p53-RE provided a negative control. The binding of p53 to RE sequences in the
promoter regions of the TLR2, TLR5, and TLR6 genes was
enriched 3- to 6-fold at 24 hours after Nutlin-3 or doxorubicin
treatments compared with the control (untreated or DMSOtreated cells). This is similar to the binding enrichment at the
well-established p53-REs in p21 or PUMA promoters. Thus, as
found in primary cells, TLRs can be direct transcriptional
targets of p53 in cancer cells.

Promoter occupancy fold change

To further investigate a direct connection between p53 and
TLR gene expression, wild-type p53 was overexpressed in p53null osteosarcoma SaOS2 cells (Fig. 1F). The pattern of induction of TLR genes differed from both U2OS and MCF7 cells. At
24 hours posttransfection, the levels of TLR2–6, 9, and 10
mRNAs were increased 2- to 10-fold (Fig. 1G) relative to
untransfected cells. The TLR1 and 7 gene expression was not
changed and TLR8 mRNA was not detected in SaOS2 cells.
Thus, we establish that many TLR genes in cancer cells are
responsive to p53. However, there are dramatic differences in
the spectra of TLRs transactivated suggesting that a proﬁle
of individual cancers needs to be considered if TLR-related
therapies are to be used.

Figure 2. Functional evaluation of proposed p53 response elements (RE)
in TLR promoters. A, SaOS2 cells were transfected with luciferase
reporter constructs containing p53-RE sequences from different TLRs in
the presence (solid bars) or absence (open bars) of the vector expressing
wild-type p53. At 48 hours posttransfection, induction of the luciferase
reporter was assessed. Relative luciferase activity was compared with
the pGL4 plasmid lacking the p53-RE (empty vector) or constructs that
contained REs of established p53 targets. Shown is an average of 3
independent experiments each carried out in triplicate. B, MCF7 cells
were treated with 0.3 mg/mL of doxorubicin (dxr) or 10 mmol/L of Nutlin-3
for 24 hours. Occupancy of p53 at promoters of TLRs 24 hours later was
assessed by ChIP assay and quantiﬁed by qPCR.

response to p53 in different cancer cell lines is expected to be
relevant to therapeutic treatments. We, therefore, determined
whether DNA damage induced by the commonly used anticancer agents doxorubicin, 5-FU, and IR can alter expression of
TLR genes in cancer cell lines and what role is played by p53.
MCF7-vector and MCF7-p53i cells were treated with
0.3 mg/mL doxorubicin for 48 hours and protein (Fig. 3A) or
total RNA (Fig. 3B) were isolated. Similar to Nutlin-3, the TLR2,
5, and 6 genes were induced by doxorubicin in a p53-dependent
fashion. Treatment with 5-FU for 24 hours (Fig. 3C) or IR
(Supplementary Fig. S3) also caused p53-dependent induction
of TLR2 and TLR6. The lack of TLR5 induction by 5-FU shows
that there are differences between agents in ability to induce
TLRs in this cancer cell line.
To conﬁrm the role of p53 in regulating of TLRs gene expression after DNA damage, U2OS cells were transiently transfected
with 25 nmol/L of p53 smart pool (p53i) or scrambled oligos
(scr) and subsequently treated for 24 hours with doxorubicin.
There was substantial induction of p53 and p21 protein levels

expression. Expression of each gene in the DMSO-treated control cells was set to one.

upon doxorubicin treatment which was prevented by transfection with p53 siRNA (Fig. 3D). As shown in Fig. 3E, there was a
strong (9- to 11-fold) p53-dependent induction of TLRs 3 and 9.
However, there also may be p53-independent induction of TLRs
2, 5, 7, and 10. The pattern of induction by 5-FU was similar
to doxorubicin except that there was p53-independent induction of TLR1 (Fig. 3F). Altogether, the results show that even
though an increase in p53 is sufﬁcient to drive expression of
TLRs in U2OS cells (as shown for Nutlin-3, Fig. 1), there are
cell-speciﬁc as well as additional stress-speciﬁc factors that
can contribute to induced expression of the TLR genes.

Doxorubicin-mediated increase in TLR5 enhances
ﬂagellin-induced cytokine responses
Next, we determined whether a p53-dependent increase in
TLR expression affects functional response to TLR ligands
downstream of receptor activation. MCF7 cells were treated
with doxorubicin to induce TLR5 protein or left untreated for
48 hours (Fig. 4A) and then exposed to the TLR5 ligand ﬂagellin
for 3 hours. There was a signiﬁcant 2- to 3-fold increase in
response to ﬂagellin in p53-positive MCF7-vector cells pretreated with doxorubicin as shown by increased production of
cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 mRNA (Fig. 4B and C).

Importantly, this effect was p53-dependent based on reduction

Differential expression proﬁle of TLR genes across
cancer cell lines
As shown earlier, several TLR genes were subject to p53
regulation in the 3 cell lines examined; however, the extent of
induction and response to speciﬁc agents was variable
between cell lines. Because induction of innate immune genes
may be important in cancer treatments and differences
between cancers could be meaningful, we expanded the panel
of cell lines examined for TLR responses to DNA-damaging
agents and p53 activation. Changes in TLR gene expression
following 24 hours treatments with Nutlin-3, doxorubicin, 5FU, IR, and UV (all known to activate p53) are presented in a
heatmap format in Fig. 5 and in Supplementary Table S2
(conditions for exposure of MCF7 cells to Nutlin-3 and doxorubicin were modiﬁed as described in the table). The red, green,
and black squares correspond, respectively, to >2.5-fold induction; less than 0.5 expression (i.e., repression) and modest or no
change in expression (0.5- to 2.5-fold).
The TLR2, 3, and 9 genes were subject to damage/p53mediated induction in almost all p53-expressing cell lines.
Reintroduction of functional wild-type p53 in p53-null cancer
cells (colon carcinoma HCT116 p53, osteosarcoma SaOS2,
and lung cancer H1299) also led to induction of most TLRs
in at least 2 of the 3 cell lines evaluated. Clearly, there is
considerable variation in responsiveness of the TLR genes
between agents across the many cell lines tested. Importantly,
induction is largely dependent on p53.

Effect of p53 mutations on TLR expression
Having established that wild-type p53 can regulate expression of TLR genes, we assessed the potential for mutant p53 to
activate endogenous TLR genes as mutants that retain function
are frequent in cancers. The osteosarcoma SaOS2 p53-null cells
were transiently transfected with vectors that express p53
mutant proteins at comparable levels (Fig. 6A).
Seven cancer-associated p53 mutants were analyzed, and the
TLR expression results are presented as a heatmap in the Fig. 6B.
Included is a brief description of the functional transactivation status for each p53 mutant based on yeast reporter assays
(36, 37). Also presented is the frequency of these mutations in
human somatic and germline tumors. The levels of mRNA from
all the TLR genes were evaluated 24 hours posttransfection.
Consistent with our previous ﬁndings, TLR8 expression was not
detected. B2M and p21 gene expression were used as respective
negative and positive controls for p53 dependency.
As shown in Fig. 6, 3 patterns of gene expression were
observed. Mutants A138V, P151H, and G279R retain the ability
to drive expression of most TLRs at levels similar to wild-type
p53. However, both A138V and P151H have decreased ability to
drive expression of TLR3 gene, a strong target of the wild-type
protein. The P151H was unable to induce TLR4. A fourth
mutant in this group, G279R, had a proﬁle similar to wild-type
for TLRs 1, 2, 3, and 4 but reduced capacity to transactivate
TLRs 5, 9, and 10 along with p21.
A much greater change-of-spectrum for TLR expression was
observed for M133T and R337H. The former exhibited limited
transactivation for TLR4 and TLR5 only. The R337H mutant
showed a clear change-in-spectrum of TLR expression when
compared with wild-type p53. In the third group, the cancer-

Discussion
Here, we show that expression of most members of the TLR
gene family in human cancer cells can be responsive to p53
activation and genotoxic stress. This is expected to increase
opportunities in TLR-based cancer treatments, especially as
therapies may include both DNA-damaging agents and
increased levels of p53. In support of this, we showed that

G245S were transcriptionally inactive toward all TLR genes as
well as p21. Differences in transactivation proﬁles for the p53
mutants were also evident for the p53 target gene p21. Thus,
cancer-associated p53 mutants can have dramatically different
effects on endogenous expression of the TLR family of genes
and potentially affect their transcriptional response to stress
and downstream signaling.

across a variety of cancer cell lines.
Presented is a heatmap of
changes in TLR gene expression
after the following treatments:
24 hours incubation with Nutlin-3,

and 5-FU, 300 mmol/L. Cells were
also exposed to IR, 10 Gy; UV,

after the treatment. MCF7 cells
were exposed to Nutlin-3,
10 mmol/L, and to 0.3 mg/mL
doxorubicin in MCF7 cells for 48
hours. Gene expression is relative
to the untreated control cells, set as
one. The red, green, and black
squares correspond, respectively,
to >2.5-fold induction; less than
0.5 expression (i.e., repression) and
modest or no change in expression
(0.5- to 2.5-fold). The values are
averages of 3 to 6 independent
experiments.

treatment of p53-positive MCF7 cells with doxorubicin before
activation of TLR5 by its ligand ﬂagellin leads to increased
downstream expression of cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. Interestingly,
treatment of breast cancer cells with ﬂagellin was recently
shown to reduce cell proliferation in culture and xenograft
growth in mice. This effect was in part mediated by ﬂagellininduced soluble factors (38). Similarly, a combined treatment
with ﬂagellin along with a class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase
inhibitor resulted in delayed tumor growth and increased
animal survival in several mouse models (39). Therefore, an
increased expression of cytokines in response to Nutlin-3/
ﬂagellin combination might predict better treatment outcome.
We have shown that there is considerable variation in
transcriptional responses of speciﬁc TLR genes between cell
lines and stressors. For example, TLR3 expression was induced
by all genotoxic agents tested in almost all the p53-positive cell

lines examined as well as by overexpression of p53 protein in
p53-null cells. TLR3 was previously shown to induce apoptosis
in cancer cells (18, 40), suggesting that a combination of TLR3
ligands with genotoxic drugs could be beneﬁcial for treatment
of tumors containing wild-type p53. Alternatively, because
DNA damage can induce TLR9 expression in p53-dependent
and -independent manners, it may be possible to amplify TLR9based treatment by genotoxic agents regardless of tumor p53
status. Similarly, enhanced expression of TLR1 and TLR7 may
be associated with cell type as well as with DNA damage
response mechanism. We did not see a dependence on p53
status for treatments leading to enhanced TLR7. The TLRs 2, 4,
5, and 6 appeared to be less subject to induction across the cell
lines examined; however, the induction generally required the
presence of functional p53. Previously, we reported that a wide
diversity in responses was also seen for p53-induced expression
of TLR genes in stimulated lymphocytes from healthy individuals (7). Similar differences between individuals in terms of
transcriptional response to IR have been observed in derived
lymphoblastoid cell lines (41). Therefore, variability between
cell lines may originate from either interindividual or tissue
type-dependent difference.

The altered function p53 mutations can result in cellular
responses that impact genome stability, repair, replication, and
programmed cell death (36, 42). Single amino acid changes in
p53 that differentially impact transactivation may alter the
efﬁcacy of chemotherapeutic agents and diversify cell responses
to stress (43). Here, we evaluated the effect of several p53
mutants associated with both somatic and germline tumors,
particularly breast and colon cancers [Fig. 5 and the IARC
database R15 (ref. 30, http://www-p53.iarc.fr/)], on expression
of the TLR genes. The changes in TLR transactivation patterns,
including change-of-spectrum, are consistent with our previous
report in which each of mutant was tested for transactivation at
11 validated human p53-REs using a yeast-based system (4).
While the classic loss-of-function mutants R175H and G245S
were unable to induce any TLR gene, the proﬁle of TLRexpressed genes for the remaining 5 p53 mutants was altered.
The R337H mutation resulted in the most dramatic changes
including loss or gain of transactivation for different TLRs
(Fig. 5). Located on the surface of the tetramerization domain
of the p53 protein, the R337H mutation is considered to have a
subtle functional transactivation change causing a pH-dependent effect on folding (44). The differential response of TLR

genes to this p53 mutant, which is associated with pediatric
adrenal cortical carcinoma, could inform treatments that are
TLR ligand–based. In our study, we observed that the R337H
p53 mutant might have the ability to induce expression of
TLR2. Other factors also may play a role in the regulation of
the adrenal response as shown for TLR9 and its relation with
sepsis response in the presence of bacterial DNA (45). These
observations support the view that the speciﬁc status of p53
should be considered in designing adjuvant cancer therapies
that use TLR pathways.
Overall, we suggest that a proﬁle of TLR gene expression
patterns in speciﬁc tumors in response to p53 and DNAdamaging agents combined with knowledge of p53 expression
and mutation status in these tumors can be an important tool
in cancer diagnosis and in strategies that target TLR pathway
for cancer therapy. For example, the presence of a p53 mutation that can change a damage-induced TLR expression pattern could determine which TLR agonists or antagonists to use
for speciﬁc tumors as well as the choices of p53 adjuvant
inducers of TLRs. Also, we suggest that there are unique
opportunities to capitalize on chromosome stress responses
in human cancer therapies that might not be apparent from
studies in other organisms as the responsiveness of the human
set of TLR genes to p53 is unique to primates (7).
