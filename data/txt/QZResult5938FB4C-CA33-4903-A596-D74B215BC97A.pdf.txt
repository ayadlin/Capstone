ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma are highly aggressive brain tumors with poor prognosis. While
various dysregulation of signaling pathways in gliomas have been described, the
identification of biomarkers and therapy targets remains an important task for novel
diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Here we described that the Suppressor of
fused (also known as Sufu) is significantly down-regulated in high-grade gliomas,
correlating with a poor prognosis. We demonstrated that ectopic expression of
Sufu inhibited cell proliferation, invasion and vasculogenic mimicry. In addition,
overexpression of Sufu reduced Gli reporter gene transcription activity and prevented
Gli1 nuclear accumulation, whereas knockdown of Sufu reversed these effects.
Furthermore, overexpressed Sufu sensitized glioblastoma to Temozolomide and
Cyclopamine. Thus, Sufu is potential tumor suppressor and therapeutic target in
glioblastoma.

Malignant primary brain tumors are major causes
of cancer-related mortality in children and young
adults [1]. Glioblastoma (GBM), which is the most
common and lethal type of primary brain tumor, is
highly infiltrative, rapidly progress and demonstrating
relative resistance to both radiotherapy and most
chemotherapeutic agents. The median survival of
GBM is about 12–15 months despite aggressive
comprehensive treatment [2–4]. Although clinical and
pathological subtype study of GBM has been increasing
in recent years, there are still few prognostic markers
and predictors of therapeutic response yet [5, 6].
Suppressor of fused (Sufu) is a powerful negative
regulator of hedgehog, WNT and other signaling pathways
in vertebrates and prevents development of malignant tumors
[7–10]. Loss of Sufu function promotes tumorigenesis.
In gastric cancer, reduced Sufu expression were found
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to be typical events in tumor tissues [11]. In  basal cell
carcinoma (BCC), Sufu restricts the activity of Gli2 through
cytoplasmic sequestration and Sufu/kif7 simultaneous
deletion induces BCC [12]. Furthermore, mutation of
Sufu was associated with familial multiple meningioma,
medulloblastoma and Gorlin syndrome [13–15]. Particularly,
researchers revealed that Sufu−/− animals developed
medulloblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma in conjunction
with p53 loss and the following hedgehog antagonist
treatment did not block growth of tumors arising from Sufu
inactivation  [7]. These researches demonstrate that Sufu
is essential for individuals’ development and functions as
a tumor suppressor. Nonetheless, differential expression,
intracellular function and latent mechanism of Sufu in
human glioma have not yet been investigated.
In this study, we analyzed Chinese Glioma Genome
Atlas (CGGA) and observed that Sufu expression was an
11681

independent risk factor for glioma patients overall survival
(OS). Further, we indicated that ectopic expression of
Sufu suppresses glioma cell growth, invasiveness, and
angiogenesis through Hedgehog signaling pathway
via Gli1 directly binding and subcellular distribution
both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, Temozolomide and
Cyclopamine efficiency is enhanced by exogenous Sufu
expression, which could benefit the clinical treatment for
glioma patients.

of Sufu was further detected in 30 glioma patients by IHC.
Similar to datasets analysis, IHC of 30 glioma patients
indicated that Sufu was lower in high grade gliomas
(WHO III, WHO IV) than that in low grade gliomas
(WHO I, WHO II) (P < 0.01) (Figure 1D). Then, we
confirmed the prognosis of CGGA patients. The optimal
cutoff for comparison of OS was identified in a randomly
split cohort. After elimination of patients with unavailable
or too short OS, remaining patients went for further
prognosis analysis. Results showed that glioma patients
with high expression of Sufu had favorable prognosis
in CGGA (except WHO II, P = 0.0612) (Figure  1A,
P < 0.05), testified by the other two validation datasets
(Figure 1B, 1C) and TCGA (Supplementary Figure  2).
Thus, Sufu was a prognostic marker in every grade
gliomas.
TCGA network describes a robust gene expressionbased molecular classification of GBM into proneural,
neural, classical, and mesenchymal subtypes, whereas
CGGA derived 3 major groups called G1, G2, and G3

RESULTS
The expression of Sufu reduced along with
grade progression
Through analyzing the discovery sets, we found that
Sufu was differently expressed in all grades of gliomas
significantly. Sufu expression reduced accompanied by
grade progression of glioma both in CGGA and the other
two validation datasets (Figure 1). The expression status

[3, 16]. To explore which subtype high- or low-level of
Sufu belongs to, we analyzed CGGA database and divided
patients into two parts according to median. As shown in
table 1, patients with high level of Sufu are younger, low
malignancy, IDH1 mutant and mainly belong to G1 and
Proneural subtype. Further, the other patients are elder,
high WHO grade, IDH1 wild type and mainly G3 and
Mesenchymal subtype.

significantly (Figure 2A) (P < 0.05). Moreover, the colony
formation was suppressed by Sufu elevating and increased
by Sufu silencing (Figure 2B) (P < 0.01). Malignant glioma
cell lines presented highly invasive growth characteristics
in vitro and vivo. Thus, wound-healing and transwell
invasion assay were performed to test whether the Sufu
could influence cell migration and invasion in vitro. Results
displayed that Sufu downregulation enhanced migration
and invasion of U251 cells compared with control
(Figure 2C, 3A). Conversely, Sufu upregulation attenuated
migration and invasion of U87 cells (Figure  2C,  3A).
Brain tumor growth and progression depends on the
establishment vascular, which confers a tremendous
survival and growth advantage on the malignant cells [17].
Among various types of vascularization, vessels formed
by tumor cells (vasculogenic mimicry, VM) provided
a complementation to tumor’s blood  supplement  [18]
and correlated with increasing malignancy and higher
aggressiveness of  glioma  [19]. For this reason, we
evaluated Sufu effects on tumor angiogenesis using glioma
cells vascular mimicry assay. As shown in Figure 3B,
both tube length and tube number/filed were significantly
decreased in Sufu-overexpressed group compared with
negative control (P < 0.05), whereas knockdown of Sufu

Sufu inhibited proliferation, restrained
migration and vasculogenic mimicry
of glioma cells
U87, U251 glioma cell lines were selected as Sufu
low-expression and high-expression cell lines used in
subsequent experiments after mRNA and protein detection
(Supplementary Figure 3).
To examine the effect of Sufu on proliferation,
MTT assay was performed (Figure 2A). The results
showed a striking reduce in the growth and indicated that
cell proliferation was inhibited in vitro after transfection
with Sufu plasmid or plain vector in U87, U251 cells in
different time points (24, 48h) (P < 0.05). Simultaneously,
Sufu siRNA or control siRNA enhanced cell proliferation

To further understand Sufu effects on tumorigenesis, we
selected Human Astrocytes (HA), the normal brain cells
to proceed following trials. The knockdown efficiency of
Sufu siRNA on HA was tested by WB (Supplementary
Figure 4B). Then, MTT and EdU proliferation assay was
performed. According to the results, the growth of HA with
low expression of Sufu was more prosperous than those of
high Sufu level (Supplementary Figure 4A, C). Collectively,
our results indicate that Sufu regulates cell proliferation,
migration and angiogenic ability of glioma cells in vitro.

Above results indicated that Sufu is a prognosis
marker in glioma and reverse glioma malignance.
However, the underlying mechanism was poorly
understood and deserved more investigation. Former
studies revealed that Gli1, a transcription factor of
hedgehog signaling pathway, is a direct target of Sufu
and is essential for tumorigenesis [20–22]. Therefore, to
investigate how Sufu influence glioma cells, we firstly

detected Gli1 and Sufu mRNA expression changes after
transfection. Results indicated that in U87 cells, Gli1
mRNA was significantly down-regulated when Sufu
expression elevated (P < 0.05). Similarly, silencing Sufu
by siRNA significantly induced Gli1 mRNA expression in
U251 (Figure 4A).WB analysis further verified Sufu effect
on Gli1 expression (Figure 4B). We next confirmed the
association between Sufu and Gli1 through a co-IP assay in
U87 cells using anti-Sufu (or anti-Gli1) antibody or control
rabbit IgG followed by immunoblotting for Gli1 (or Sufu).
Sufu could bind to Gli1 directly and the association of
Sufu-Gli1 could be enhanced by exogenous expression
of Sufu and weaken by knockdown of endogenous Sufu

(Fig. 4F). Moreover, after treatment of recombinant
Shh (rShh, 1 μg/mL, R&D), GANT61 (30 μM,
Sigma-Aldridge), Cyclopamine (10 μM, Sigma-Aldridge),
Sufu plasmid or plain vector and Sufu siRNA or control
siRNA for another 48 h, we found that GANT61,
Cyclopamine and Sufu plasmid transfection repressed
luciferase activity significantly compared with control
or vector group, meanwhile rShh, Sufu siRNA greatly
enhanced the activity compared with control or scramble
group (Figure 4C) (P < 0.05). These data revealed
that Sufu suppressed Gli1 activation. Impressively,
overexpression of Sufu reduced the expression of Gli1
induced by hedgehog signaling agonist rShh.

Sufu inhibited Gli1 nuclear localization and
promoted Gli1 proteolysis

In Figure 4E, Sufu transfected cells showed reduced
accumulation of Gli1 compared to vector control group.
Further, in figure 4D, cells with high expression of
Sufu suppressed Gli1 nuclear localization tested
by WB. Moreover, Sufu suppressive effects on Gli1
protein were weaken after treated with 10 µM of the
protease inhibitor Carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinylleucinal-H (MG132, Selleckchem) for 6h, suggesting
that Sufu could inhibited Gli1 by proteolysis
(Figure 4G).

Gli1 functions as a transcription factor by translocating to nucleus, where it binds to a consensus
Gli1-binding element in target genes resulting in their
activation [23]. For this reason, nuclear accumulation
is critical for Gli1 functions. Hence, we used IF and
WB analysis of cytoplasmic and nuclear protein level to
confirm Sufu inhibition on Gli1 expression in U87 cells.

inhibition and proteolysis. (A, B) mRNA and protein expression changes after Sufu elevating in U87 cells and silencing in U251 cells.

Expression of Sufu correlated with glioma cells
sensitivity to Temozolomide and Cyclopamine

viability strongly. Further, over-expressed Sufu combined
with 5 μM Cyclopamine could suppressed glioma cells
proliferation significantly compared with Cyclopamine
alone (Supplementary Figure 4E). This may provide a
new approach for clinical glioma treatment, especially the
Cyclopamine-resistant patients.

Clinical trials have shown that patient survival can be
extended by additional Temozolomide (TMZ) therapy [24].
Even so, resistant of glioma to TMZ restricted its
clinical effectiveness. To explore whether different
status of Sufu level effect TMZ therapy, we performed
MTT assay. In Supplementary Figure 5A, U87 cells
transfected with Sufu plasmid was more sensitive than
control, while knockdown of Sufu by siRNA increased
U87 TMZ resistance. To investigate the mechanism,
we analyzed CGGA to determine the relationship of
Sufu and O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase
(MGMT), a methyltransferase which can reverse TMZinduced cytotoxicity [25, 26]. Results demonstrated that
Sufu and MGMT expression was negatively correlated
(Supplementary Figure 5B) (R = −0.2655, P = 0.014).
Same relationship was testified by qRT-PCR
(Supplementary Figure 5C) that Sufu mediates MGMT
expression, which partially illustrated correlationship
between Sufu and TMZ therapy.
Cyclopamine, produced by hellebore, could inhibit
proliferation and induces apoptosis in cancer cells by
targeting the key oncogene Smo of Hedgehog pathway [27].
In our study, we testified the effect of Cyclopamine on
glioma cell lines, either (Supplementary Figure 5D).
5 μM and 10 μM Cyclopamine both repressed U87 cell

Sufu inhibited tumor growth in vivo and
prolonged the survival period
Because ectopic expression of Sufu suppressed
invasion, proliferation and angiogenesis of glioma cells
in vitro, we further assessed its effect in vivo. When the
mice were intracranially transplanted with U87-luc cells
that stably express Sufu or plain vector, bioluminescence
imaging was done for the whole mice. Sufu-treated
U87 cells displayed a considerable reduction of tumor
(Figure 5A). IHC analysis confirmed that Sufu plasmid
enhanced Sufu expression and reduced Gli1 expression
and nuclear accumulation in tumor, compared with control
group (Figure 5B). To better evaluate the effect of Sufu
on nude mice survival, the survival period of each group
(n = 7/group) was analyzed by Kaplan–Meier curve.
The Sufu overexpression group showed a significant
improvement in survival until the end of the observation
period compared to the plain vector controls (P = 0.0101)
(Figure 5C). Accordingly, results demonstrated that Sufu
functions similarly in vivo.

Sufu expression inversely correlated with Gli1
in human glioma and acted as an independent
prognostic factor

shed light on the molecular underpinnings of ACCs [28].
Further, a subset of medulloblastoma patients carried
germline and somatic Sufu mutations suggesting Sufu as
a tumor suppressor [15]. Reduced Sufu expression or Sufu
mutations were also found to be typical events in other
tumor tissues, including gastric cancer, familial multiple
meningioma, Gorlin syndrome, basal cell carcinoma and
rhabdomyosarcoma. However, there have been no reports
investigating the role of Sufu and its molecular mechanism
in glioma yet. In present study, we showed that Sufu
expression is down-regulated along with glioma grades and
there was a negative correlation between Sufu expression
and advanced clinical pathological features. To explain this
phenomenon, we analyzed Sufu sequence through UCSC
Genome Browser on Human (http://genome.ucsc.edu) and
confirmed the existence of CpG islands near transcription
start sites, which is deactivated under normal state.
CpG islands of Sufu could be methylated during glioma
formation and lead to gene inactivity, which will result in
the loss of Sufu function. What’s more, professor Yang and
his colleagues advocated that Sufu was a potential target of
miR-378 and James G Patton, et al. demonstrated that miR214 could repress the expression of Sufu, either [29, 30].
Therefore, the regulatory function of microRNA (miRNA)
may be another potential mechanism.
The G1 subgroup was characterized by good clinical
outcome, young age, low malignant behaviors, and
extraordinary high IDH1 mutation [16]. And one of the
major features of the Proneural class was point mutations
in IDH1 [3]. Notably, the patients with high expression of
Sufu were younger, higher rate of mutations in the IDH1
gene and better outcome, either. These indicated that high
level of Sufu belongs to G1/Proneural class and associated
with favorable prognosis.
As reported previously, infiltrative invasion,
incontrollable proliferation and excessive vascularization
are hallmarks of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) [31–33].
In our study, functional experiments via gain- or lossof-function studies showed that Sufu overexpression

To determine whether the inverse relationship
between Sufu and Gli1 expression was consistent
in vitro and in patient samples, we quantified expression
levels of Sufu and Gli1 in glioma tissue specimens by
IHC assay and datasets analysis. High-grade glioma
contained comparatively lower Sufu expression and
higher Gli1 (Figure 6A). Spearman’s correlation analysis
of IHC demonstrated that Sufu in tumor tissues inversely
correlated with Gli1 expression (Figure 6B). Similarly,
Pearson’s correlation analysis of CGGA revealed that
the relationship between Sufu and Gli1 was negatively
(Supplementary Figure 6). In 58 WHO IV glioma patients
received standard treatment and selected from CGGA
database, Sufu expression was correlated with OS by
univariate analysis (P = 0.017) (Table 2). The median
OS time of Sufu high-expressed patients was 408 days,
while it was 319 days for low Sufu expression patients.
Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score was correlated
with OS (P = 0.008), either. There were no significant
associations between age, gender and OS. The multivariate
Cox proportional hazards model identified Sufu expression
as an independent prognostic factor for OS (Relative Risk,
2.041; P = 0.019). In summary, these data indicate that
Sufu has significant clinical impact on glioma.

DISCUSSION
The Suppressor of fused (Sufu) is an essential
negative regulator for mammals and plays vital roles in
multi-biological process. Loss of Sufu is associated with
tumorigenicity reported in different cancers. Philip J.
Stephens, et al. undertook exome sequencing in a series
of 24 adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACCs) and identified
that Sufu is one of multiple mutated genes, which could

suppressed glioma cell proliferation, invasiveness,
vascular mimicry (VM) and in vivo tumor growth.
Conversely, Sufu silencing with siRNA increased these
effects. Hedgehog signaling pathway is a morphogen,
which determines cell fate during development [27].
Activation of glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1
(Gli1), which was a nuclear transcription factor
overexpressed in human glioma [34], enhanced the
expression of multiple important Gli1 directly regulated
oncoproteins significantly, including CyclinD1/D2 [35],
Foxm1 [36], Bcl-2 [37], and epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) related proteins [38]. Meanwhile,
studies indicated MMP2/MMP9, MT1-MMP, and VEGF
could also be mediated by Gli1 activation, inevitably lead
to invasiveness and vascularization differences [37, 39].
Inhibition of Gli1 induces DNA damage, cell cycle arrest,
cell apoptosis and tumor metastasis [40]. Our results
demonstrated that Sufu combined with Gli1 directly to
form Sufu-Gli1 complex, which could inhibit Gli1 nuclear
accumulation and sequentially repressed Gli1 transcription
activity. Meanwhile, the complex is transported to
proteasome and degraded. Accordingly, the latent
mechanism of Sufu effects on glioma biological behavior
could be owed to the inhibition of Gli1 transcription and
suppression of downstream genes.
Nowadays, temozolomide (TMZ) has become
a key therapeutic agent for patients with malignant
gliomas multimodality treatment. However, recent
studies observed the resistance to TMZ in malignant
gliomas, which attenuated its survival benefit. In our

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

study, combined therapy of TMZ and exogenous
Sufu expression significantly suppressed glioma cell
proliferation than TMZ group. According to previous
researches, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase
(MGMT), which causes the replication of DNA and
the growth of malignant gliomas via removal of the
alkylating lesion at the O6 position of guanine, may
partially contribute to glioma resistance to TMZ therapy
[41, 42]. By analyzing mRNA expression of CGGA and
qRT-PCR, we observed that Sufu expression was
negatively correlated with MGMT expression and Sufu
elevation repressed MGMT expression, suggesting that
Sufu enhanced TMZ sensitivity by down-regulating
MGMT transcription, which further emphasizes the clinical
significance of Sufu. Moreover, isocitrate dehydrogenase
(IDH) mutation is regarded as a founder biochemical event
in tumorigenesis that triggers methylation of MGMT gene
[43, 44], which leads to increased sensitivity of TMZ
therapy. Thus, to further investigate the latent mechanism
of Sufu effects on TMZ treatment, its relationship with
IDH mutation deserved more attention. Cyclopamine is
a naturally occurring steroidal alkaloid that attenuates
the Hedgehog signaling pathway by inhibiting the
Smo receptor [27]. Recently, multi-target therapy was
introduced for clinical trials and more effective than single
target drugs. Here, we demonstrated that combination
chemotherapy – incorporating a Smo inhibitor and
Gli1 suppressor – could benefit glioma patients of
traditional drug resistance, especially those resistant to
Cyclopamine.

Cell proliferation assay and
colony formation assay

In conclusion, our study demonstrated that Sufu
reduced along with glioma grade and is an independent
prognostic factor for glioma patients, suggesting that it
could be used as a prognostic biomarker for outcome and
may represent a future therapeutic target.

A total of 2000 exponential phase cells were
plated onto each well of 96-well plates (100 μL medium/
well) and cultured overnight. Then, U87 and U251 cells
were transfected with Sufu plasmid or plain vector,
siRNA or control siRNA for another 48 h. At different
time interval, 10 μL/well MTT solution (Sigma-Aldrich)
was added and incubated for 4 h. Subsequently, the
medium was replaced by DMSO for 10 min and
quantified formazan amount with IMARK microplate
reader at 490 nm of absorbance. For colony formation
assay, 300 transfected cells were seeded in 6-well plates
and cultured for another 12 days in complete medium
until megascopic colonies appeared. The colonies
obtained were washed with PBS and fixed in 10%
formaldehyde for 10 min and stained with Giemsa stain
at room temperature. Each experiment was performed
in triplicate.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics statement
Informed consent was obtained from all patients
involved in this study, and the study protocol was
approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of
the 2nd affiliated hospital of Harbin Medical University.
The protocol for all animal studies was approved by the
Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the 2nd affiliated
hospital of Harbin Medical College, either.

Tissue samples and clinical datasets
Samples were consisted of 12 World Health
Organization (WHO) grade I-II tumors and 18 WHO
grade III-IV tumors (Supplementary Table S1). Freshly
resected tissue samples were immediately frozen in
liquid nitrogen for subsequent experiments. 220 glioma
samples of all grades from Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas
(CGGA) database [16] were obtained as discovery  set
and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database [3],
the Repository for Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data
(REMBRANDT) and GSE16011 data [45] were obtained
as validation sets.

Wound healing assay and transwell
invasion assay
U87 and U251 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and
cultured until confluency. Then, cells were transfected with
plasmids or siRNA and a scratch was created by manually
scraping the cell monolayer with a 200-microliter sterile
pipette tip. The cells were washed twice with PBS and
then incubated in DMEM without FBS. Photographs of
the scratched area were taken at 0 h and after 24 h using
an Axiovert 200 microscope (Carl Zeiss) and analyzed by
Image pro-plus software. The scratch was captured in six
different photographs.
The transwell invasion assay was done in 24-well
cell culture chambers using transwell inserts (Corning)
with 8-µm pore membrane pre-coated with Matrigel
(BD Bioscience) [46]. Briefly, transfected cells were
plated at the density of 1 × 104 per upper well in 200 µL
culture medium (DMEM only). The lower chamber was
filled with 500 µL medium (DMEM, 12% FBS). 24 h
later, upper surface were removed by scrubbing with
a cotton-tipped swab, while lower surface were fixed
for 30 min in methanol, air-dried briefly and stained
with crystal violet. All experiments were performed in
triplicate.

Plasmids and small interfering RNA (siRNA)
Sufu (NM_016169) plasmid and plain vector
(CMV-MCS-EGFP-SV40-Neomycin) were purchased
from Genechem Company (Shanghai, China). Sufu siRNA
and Control siRNA were obtained from Ribobio Company
(Guangzhou, China). The Sufu siRNA1, siRNA2 and
siRNA3 target sequence were listed in Supplementary
Table S2 and knockdown efficiency were testified by
qRT-PCR (Supplementary Figure 1).

Cell Lines and culture condition
Human glioma cell lines (U87, U251) were
purchased from Chinese Academy of Sciences Cell
Bank. All cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Bioind) and 1%
antibiotic (Gibco) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere
with 5% CO2 and 95% air. The cells were passaged every
2 days. Stable U87 cell line for the overexpression of
Sufu or plain vector were selected using 0.8 mg/mL G418
(Amresco) for 2 weeks and then cultured in 10% FBS with
0.4 mg/mL G418.

Vascular mimicry assay
Vascular mimicry assay was processed as described
previously [47]. In sum, 3 × 104 transfected U87 and U251
cells were seeded onto 48-well pre-coated with Matrigel.
Tube formation was assessed under a phase-contrast
microscope 8 h after seeding. All experiments were
performed in triplicate.

Quantitative real-time PCR

Each group has 7 mice. After 20 days, tumors were
measured by bioluminescence using an IVIS Lumina
Imaging System (Xenogen). After 45 days, left mice were
sacrificed. Paraffin sections (4 mm) were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin and used for IHC.

Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen). The cDNAs were synthesized as PrimeScript
RT reagents Kit (TaKaRa) manufacturer’s instructions.
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR) was performed in triplicate with
LightCycler2.0 (Roche Diagnostics Company) and
normalized to β-actin as endogenous control. Endogenous
mRNA levels of Sufu, Gli1, MGMT and β-actin were
determined with SYBR PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit
(TaKaRa). The PCR primers designed and synthesized by
Sangon Biotech (Shanghai) were listed in Supplementary
Table S3. The relative quantitation value for each target
gene was expressed as 2-∆∆Ct as previous described [48].

Statistical analysis
The significance of differences between two groups
was estimated with the Student t test and Chi-square test.
Overall survival (OS) curves were plotted according to
the Kaplan–Meier method, with the log-rank test applied for
comparison. Pearson or Spearman correlationship analyses
were used to confirm relationship between different genes.
Cox regression was used to correlate Sufu expression with
OS of high-grade glioma patients. All differences were
considered statistically significant at the level of P < 0.05.
Statistics were performed using the SPSS Graduate
Pack 19.0 statistical software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).

Western blot, immunofluorescence,
immunoprecipitation and
immunohistochemistry

Databases used

Western Blot (WB), immunofluorescence (IF) and
immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays were performed as
previously described [49, 50]. Rabbit anti-Sufu (1:1000,
Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-Gli1 (1:1000, Cell
Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-fibrillarin (1:1000,
Proteintech) mouse anti-β-actin, anti-GAPDH antibody
(1:1000, Sigma-Aldridge) and HRP-labeled secondary
antibody (1:4000, Zsbio) were used in WB. Rabbit antibodies
against Sufu, Gli1 (1:100, Bioss) and TRITIC labeled
secondary antibody (1:100, Zsbio) were used for IHC and IF.
For co-Immunoprecipitation (co-IP), the cells were
lysed using RIPA buffer and incubated with 20 μL of
protein-A/G PLUS-Agarose beads (Santa Cruz) and 1 μg
of the appropriate primary antibodies at 4°C overnight.
After washing 3 times with RIPA, the samples were
analyzed through WB.

Gli reporter assay
To determine Gli activity, a reporter was kindly
provided by Gregory J. Gores, M.D. (Division of liver
pathobiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN) containing
eight directly repeated copies of a consensus Gli binding
site (8x-Gli) downstream of the luciferase gene was used.
The procedure of assay was illustrated previously [50].
Briefly, 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with
different intervene for another 24 h. Then, cell lysates
were prepared and quantified using the Dual-Luciferase
Reporter Assay System (Promega). Data were expressed
as fold increase over control.
