BACKGROUND: Patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) often have residual leukemia in the
bone marrow 10 to 14 days after the start of induction therapy. Some cooperative groups administer a second cycle
of similar induction therapy on Day 14 if there is residual leukemia. It is a common perception that the presence of
residual leukemia at that point predicts a worse prognosis irrespective of the therapy received. The objective of
this study was to determine whether patients who required a second cycle of induction (given on or about Day 14)
to achieve complete remission (CR) had a worse prognosis than patients who achieved CR after only 1 cycle,
because a worse prognosis may alter postremission therapy. METHODS: Patients who were enrolled on 6 consecutive studies for AML that were conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) between 1983 to
1993 received induction therapy. If residual leukemia was present in the bone marrow on the Day 14 after the start of
induction, then patients were to receive a second cycle of identical induction therapy. All patients who achieved CR
after 1 or 2 cycles received the identical postremission therapy. RESULTS: In each of the 6 ECOG studies, the longterm outcome was similar for patients who required 1 or 2 cycles of induction therapy to achieve CR, and their outcome was independent of other prognostic variables, such as age or karyotype. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of residual leukemia in bone marrow 10 to 14 days after induction therapy did not predict a worse prognosis if patients

Prognostic factors for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at diagnosis include cytogenetics.1,2 the fms-related tyrosine
kinase 3 gene (FLT3),3,4 the CCATT/enhancer binding protein alpha gene (CEPBA),5,6 the Wilms tumor gene (WT1),7
the myeloid-lymphoid or mixed lineage leukemia gene (MLL),8 the nucleophosmin gene (NMP1),9 age,10 multidrug resistance (MDR) status,11 and white blood cell (WBC) count at presentation.12 The time to achieve complete remission
(CR)13 and the time to clearance of peripheral blast cells14,15 have been reported as independent postinduction prognostic
factors in patients with AML. Furthermore, some investigators have considered patients who do not achieve CR with 1
cycle as refractory or as primary induction failure.16,17 In those studies, patients who failed to achieve CR after 1 cycle generally were not given additional therapy on Day 14 if the bone marrow demonstrated residual leukemia, and most (if not
all) of such patients can be expected not to be in CR at the end of induction therapy. Residual leukemia present in bone
marrow on Day 14 can be an early indicator of a highly resistant clone, but it also can represent a slower response to

therapy. Although it is possible that some patients with residual leukemia will achieve a subsequent CR,18 most
such patients will not be in CR at the end of induction. At
the same time, some patients may enter CR if early therapeutic intervention, on or about Day 14, is administered.
Furthermore, if, on or about Day 14, further therapy is
given and the patient achieves CR, little is known about
the long-term outcome. Thus, it remains to be determined whether it is appropriate to consider a patient with
residual leukemia on Day 14 as refractory.
The standard practice of the Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) for the treatment of AML
mandates that, if the bone marrow on Day 10 to Day 14
of induction demonstrates unequivocal residual leukemia
in a bone marrow sample that is not hypocellular, then a
repeat course of the identical induction therapy is given at
that point. The planned postremission therapy is identical
whether 1 or 2 cycles are required to achieve CR.
Because the postremission therapy is not altered by
the presence of residual leukemia on approximately Day
14, it is possible to evaluate its true impact on long-term
prognosis. For the current report, we evaluated patients
who were treated on 6 consecutive ECOG studies, which
were conducted between 1983 and 1993 and comprised
approximately 2000 patients, to assess whether long-term
survival was affected by the number of cycles given to
achieve CR. This issue is important to address if patients
who require a second cycle of induction therapy to achieve
CR have a worse prognosis, because it may change their
postremission strategy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Between 1983 and 1993, 1980 patients were registered on
6 consecutive ECOG studies (E3483, PC486, E1490,
E2491/INT0129, E3489, and E3993). All studies were
approved by the institutional review boards, and all
patients provided written informed consent. These studies
were for patients ages 18 to 55 years (E3483, PC486, and
E3489), ages 56 to 70 years (E1490), aged >56 years
(E3993), and with no age limit (E2491/INT0129) (Fig. 1).
Of all 1980 patients, 1272 achieved CR (64%) and were
available for analysis. In each study, patients received
standard induction therapy, which consisted of daunorubicin 60 mg/m2 (E3483, PC486, and E1490) or 45 mg/m2
(E2491/INT0129); or idarubicin 12 mg/m2 (E3489); or
a randomization between daunorubicin 45 mg/m2, idarubicin 12 mg/m2, or mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 (E3993)—
all for 3 days—together with cytarabine 100 mg/m2 to

200 mg/m2 as a continuous infusion for 7 days (Fig. 1). It
should be noted that in the North American Intergroup
Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) study (E2491/
INT0129), patients who received all-trans-retinoic acid
(ATRA) at induction were excluded from the current
analysis. In each study, patients were to receive a second
cycle of identical induction therapy if the Day 10 to Day
14 bone marrow demonstrated unequivocal residual leukemia. Identical study-specific postremission therapy,
including consolidation therapy and/or allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation, was received by all
patients who achieved CR irrespective of whether it was
achieved after 1 cycle or after 2 cycles.
Study E3483
E3483 (Fig. 1A) was a phase 3 trial for patients aged 18 to
56 years that consisted of therapy with daunorubicin
60 mg/m2 for 3 days, cytarabine 200 mg/m2 for 7 days,
and 6-thioguanine 100 mg/m2 for 5 days as induction
therapy followed by postremission therapy, which consisted of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) if a patient had a histocompatible (human
leukemic antigen [HLA]) sibling and was aged <55 years,
high-dose therapy with cytarabine and amsacrine, and
maintenance therapy with low-dose cytarabine and 6-thioguanine; an observation arm also was included.19
Study PC486
PC486 (Fig. 1B) was a phase 2 study for patients aged 18
to 55 years using induction therapy with daunorubicin 60
mg/m2 for 3 days and cytarabine 200 mg/m2 for 7 days.
Patients in CR underwent autologous HSCT without any
prior intensification.20
Study E3489
E3489 (Fig. 1C) was a US intergroup study for patients
aged 18 to 55 years who received induction therapy with
idarubicin 12 mg/m2 for 3 days together with cytarabine
100 mg/m2 for 7 days. If they were in CR, then all
patients received a second cycle of ‘‘attenuated’’ induction (‘‘2 þ 5’’) consisting of idarubicin and cytarabine.
The purpose of this added therapy at that point was to
enable the various postremission modalities to be given
at the same time, which included the period needed (in
the year 1989) to search for a donor and refer a patient
to a transplantation center. For postremission, patients
were assigned to undergo allogeneic HSCT if they had
an HLA-compatible sibling. Otherwise, they were

cytarabine 100 mg/m2 for 7 days. This induction regimen
was compared with ATRA given as a single agent without
concurrent chemotherapy. For consolidation, patients
received 2 cycles of daunorubicin and cytarabine followed
by a maintenance randomization to either ATRA therapy
for 1 year or observation.23
Study E3993
E3993 (Fig. 1F) was a study for patients aged 56 years
with no upper age limit. They were randomized at induction to receive daunorubicin 45 mg/m2 for 3 days, versus
mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 for 3 days, versus idarubicin
12 mg/m2 for 3 days. All patients received cytarabine
100 mg/m2 for 7 days. At induction, there also was a randomization to GM-CSF given as priming therapy versus
placebo. For consolidation, patients received only 1 cycle
of high-dose cytarabine (attenuated for age).24
Statistical Analysis
Two primary endpoints were explored in this analysis:
disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). DFS
was defined as the time from documented CR until
relapse or death from any cause. The Kaplan-Meier (KM)
method was used to estimate DFS and OS, and the logrank test was used to test the difference in KM curves
between 1 cycle and 2 cycles of induction therapy. Furthermore, multivariate Cox regression analysis was used
to investigate whether the number of cycles of induction
therapy had prognostic significance in the presence of
other known prognostic factors for AML, such as age at
study entry, sex, race, baseline hemoglobin levels, WBC
count, platelet count, and karyotype, although the latter
was available only for studies E3489 and E3993. The proportional hazards assumption in the Cox model was
assessed, and all 2-way interactions were examined. In
addition, baseline characteristics were compared using a
2-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables
and the Fisher exact test for categorical variables.
All patients who achieved CR, which we defined
according to the International Working Group,25 were
included in this analysis. Thus, the study also included
those patients who achieved CR but did not receive further postremission therapy.

RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
Baseline characteristics are listed in Table 1. Apart from
age in E3483 and white cell count in E2491, the number

Cancer

of induction cycles that led successfully to CR was not
affected by age, WBC count, platelet count, or hemoglobin level at presentation.
Table 2 summarizes the CR rate in each study and
the number of induction cycles required to achieve CR. In
total, 1272 of 1980 patients (64%) achieved CR, including 74% who reached CR after 1 cycle and 26% who
reached CR after 2 cycles. Table 3 provides a further
breakdown of the CR rates and the number of cycles given
in each study.
In multivariate analysis, the important prognostic
factors at diagnosis for achieving CR included age (E3483
and E3993), being a man (E3483 and E1490), WBC
count (E3489), hemoglobin level (E3483), and cytogenetics (E3489 and E3993; data not shown). The rates of
consolidation actually given to patients according to protocol were similar whether CR was achieved after 1 cycle
or after 2 cycles.
Disease-Free and Overall Survival
The 5-year and 10-year DFS and OS rates for each study
are listed in Table 4. The difference in long-term outcome
was not affected significantly by the need for 1 cycles or 2
cycles to achieve CR in any study. In multivariate Cox
regression model, these overall results demonstrating no
difference between 1 cycle and 2 cycles were not affected
by age, presenting WBC count, hemoglobin level, platelet
count, or cytogenetics (data not shown) (Table 5). Karyotypes were routinely available only for studies E3489 and
E3993. The distributions of the cytogenetic risk groups
were similar between 1 cycle and 2 cycles for all patients
or for patients who achieved CR only in those 2 studies
(Table 6). In E2491, almost all patients had the abnormal
15;17 translocation. In the Cox model (Table 5), the hazard ratio was similar with and without karyotype data in
these 2 studies (E3489 and E3993). In fact, the P value
was even less significant with the inclusion of karyotype
data in the model. Figure 2 graphically depicts the DFS in
all 6 studies according to the number of induction cycles
received.

DISCUSSION
Several studies have addressed the significance of Day 10
to Day 14 bone marrow status without regard to subsequent therapy that was given.26-30 The issue that we
addressed in the current study is what happens to patients
who have residual leukemia in bone marrow on Day 10 to
Day 14, receive a second cycle of induction therapy at that

our study demonstrate that such patients do not have a
worse long-term outcome than patients who achieve CR
after 1 cycle; therefore, no modification of postremission

recommendation for patients to receive a second cycle on
Day 14. Rather, the study negates a common perception
and practice that patients who achieve CR after a second
cycle of induction given on Day 10 to Day 14 have a
worse prognosis such that their planned postremission
intervention needs to be altered.

The current analysis included patients who were registered on clinical trials since 1983. According to protocol,
all patients who had residual leukemia on Day 10 to Day
14 were to receive a second course of therapy. Twenty-six
percent of patients who eventually achieved CR required
2 courses of induction therapy, although the percentage of
patients who received 2 courses varied between studies
(Table 2). Above all else, this also reflects the feasibility
and safety in young adults of administering a second
course of induction therapy on or about Day 14. This
does not suggest that all patients who received such therapy would not have achieved CR if a second cycle had not
been given.18 Indeed, in some earlier studies of APL, residual leukemia on Day 14 may have been overdiagnosed.31 Furthermore, in the early studies, patients may
have been diagnosed with residual leukemia based on a
very hypocellular bone marrow. The rigorous criteria of
having unequivocal residual leukemia in the bone marrow
that is not hypocellular were instituted more commonly
only in the protocols that were conducted in the early
1990s.32 Nonetheless, the rigorous requirement for the
assessment of bone marrow that may not be hypocellular
is not uniform, and, in most of the earlier analyses,33,34

this was not required. The data in this report encompass 6
studies that were conducted at different time points, with
possibly slightly different criteria for defining residual leukemia, but with an overall result that was similar and consistent in each study. Patients with APL who did not
receive ATRA were included in this analysis, because they
were a part of consecutive studies for patients with newly
diagnosed AML or APL, and the results from the specific
study (E2491/INT0129) are virtually superimposable on
the results from the other studies and, excluding that
study, do not alter the final conclusions. In addition, a few
patients with APL were included in the earlier studies for
AML (E3483, PC486, and E1490) and, thus, were not
excluded.
The prognostic significance of the time to CR in this
report (1 cycle or 2 cycles) was independent from other
prognostic factors, such as age, presenting WBC count,
hemoglobin level, platelet count, or karyotype. Although
there is an overall perception that patients who have residual leukemia on approximately Day 14 have a worse prognosis, this perception should not affect the management
of those patients who achieve CR if a second cycle is
administered promptly on Day 14. Such patients had a
long-term prognosis that was indistinguishable from the
prognosis for patients who achieved CR after 1 cycle of
induction therapy.
There is no doubt that the presence of residual leukemia in bone marrow on Day 14 portends a worse
prognosis.13-17 In many studies, no further therapy is
given on Day 14, and treatment decisions for postremission therapy are based entirely on whether or not a CR
was achieved at the end of a single cycle. The actual presence of residual leukemia on Day 14 or earlier or the
delayed clearance of blasts from the peripheral blood predicted a worse prognosis according to several publications.13-15,18,27-29,33-35

Table 4. Five-Year and 10-Year Disease-Free and Overall
Survival Rates According to the Number of Induction Cycles
Needed to Achieve Complete Remission

Two major studies routinely administered 2 cycles
of induction irrespective of whether CR was achieved after
the first cycle. However, none administered this as early as
Day 14. The Medical Research Council (MRC) in the
United Kingdom evaluated more than 1700 patients on
their AML10 trial.36 In a careful analysis, the 2 most predictive parameters for outcome were cytogenetics and
response after 1 cycle of therapy. In that MRC trial,
patients received 2 courses of induction therapy. However, the second course invariably was given at the end of
completion of the first cycle whether or not a patient had
achieved a CR. Patients never were treated as early as Day
14. The response was assessed only at the end of induction, which was about 4 weeks after the start of induction.33,36 In the German AML Cooperative Group 1992
trial, patients received induction therapy with daunorubicin, cytarabine, and 6-thioguainine. A second course of
therapy that consisted of high-dose cytarabine with mitoxantrone was administered on about Day 21. On Day 16,
bone marrow was assessed for residual leukemia, but no
therapy was given at Day 16. The authors reported that
patients who had >10% blasts in bone marrow on Day
16 had only a 54% CR rate compared with patients who
had <10% blasts in bone marrow on Day 16, who had an
84% CR rate. The adverse prognostic value of the Day 16
bone marrow was independent of all other variables,
including cytogenetics.34 The impact of bone marrow cellularity on the assessment of the presence of bone marrow
blasts was not discussed.
Several other studies assessed the time to CR or
clearance of peripheral blasts. In a large retrospective analysis reported from the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in
1996, 1101 patients with newly diagnosed AML or
advanced myelodysplasia were examined. In that study,
the authors observed a strong correlation between OS and
the time to CR, which was an independent prognostic factor and was not affected by other prognostic variables

AML Induction Cycles and Prognosis/Rowe et al

Figure 2. Disease-free survival is illustrated according to the number of induction cycles to achieve complete remission for
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group studies (A) E3483, (B) PC486, (C) E3489, (D) E1490, (E) E2491/INT0129, and (F) E3993.

such as karyotype.13 In that study, as in the previous studies, patients did not receive a second course of induction
on Day 14 if there was evidence of residual leukemia at
that point. An early report from over 2 decades ago
assessed bone marrow on Day 6 for the degree of cellularity and residual blasts. In that study, 116 of 253 patients
had >30% cellularity in the bone marrow biopsy or had
>10% abnormal blast cells in the aspirate, and those
patients received high-dose therapy on Days 8, 9, and 10
of induction. There was a nonstatistically significant trend
toward an improved CR rate for the patients who received
the added therapy on Day 8 (69%) versus those who did
not (60%).28 Several smaller reports in recent years have
described the relation between the rate of clearance of leukemic blasts from the peripheral blood and the likelihood

of achieving a response.14,15 In 1 report from Italy,14
patients who achieved CR had a significantly more rapid
clearance of peripheral blood that could be determined
from Day 2 to Day 6 of induction therapy. For example,
on Day 6, patients who achieved CR had a 3.71 log reduction in their peripheral blasts compared with a 2.08 log
reduction for those who did not achieve CR (P ¼ .0001).
Another report on 86 adult patients with previously
untreated AML demonstrated once again the correlation
between the overall recurrence-free survival and the rate of
blast clearance and actually separated the patients into 3
prognostic groups. Patients at ‘‘good risk’’ were those who
had blast clearance before Day 3, the ‘‘intermediate-risk’’
group included patients who had blast clearance on Days
4 or 5, and patients in the ‘‘poor-risk’’ group had

5019

Original Article

peripheral blast clearance only after Day 6 (P < .001).15
Not surprisingly, another Italian group correlated the
findings in bone marrow on Day 15 with cytogenetics and
reported that >90% of patients who had the favorable
karyotype had <10% bone marrow blasts at Day 14 compared with <20% bone marrow blasts among patients
who had the unfavorable karyotype. It is clear that, as new
prognostic markers are being used increasingly in patients
with AML, such as FLT3 or NPM1, these analyses are
likely to be refined further in the future.
The issue addressed in this report has practical
implications. For example, in a large prospective study of
patients with AML, residual leukemia in a patient who
had a normal karyotype was an indication for referral to
undergo a matched unrelated donor HSCT.37 The data
from our study do not support assigning such high-risk
status to patients based on the Day-14 bone marrow
alone. Furthermore, future studies will need to determine
whether the findings in our study also are applicable to
patients who have adverse molecular subtypes, such as
FLT3-positive/NPM1-negative disease.9
