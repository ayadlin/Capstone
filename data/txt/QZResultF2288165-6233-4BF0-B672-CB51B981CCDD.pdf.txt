BACKGROUND: Treatment of small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors (SINETs) with mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) inhibitors alone or with somatostatin analogs has been proposed as effective therapy, because both agents
have been reported to exhibit antiproliferative activity. Because adenocarcinomas escape mTOR inhibition, we examined whether the escape phenomenon occurred in SINETs and whether usage of somatostatin analogs with mTOR
inhibitors surmounted loss of inhibition. METHODS: The effects of the somatostatin analog octreotide (OCT), the
mTOR inhibitor RAD001 (RAD), or the combination were evaluated in SINET cell lines (KRJ-I, H-STS) using cell viability assays, western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction to assess antiproliferative signaling pathways and feedback regulation. RESULTS: RAD (109 M) incompletely
decreased cell viability (40% to þ15%); growth escape (P < .001) was noted at 72 hours in both cell lines. Phosphorylated (p)mTOR/mTOR and pp70S6K/p70S6K ratios were decreased but were associated with increases in phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK)/ERK and pAKT/AKT in both cell lines, whereas
phosphorylated insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (pIGF-1R)/IGF-1R levels were elevated only in H-STS cells.
Increased (P < .05) transcript levels for AKT1, MAPK, mTOR, IGF-1R, IGF-1, and TGFb1 were evident. OCT (106 M)
itself had no significant effect on growth signaling in either cell line. An antiproliferative effect (66  5%) using
OCTþRAD was only noted in the KRJ-I cells (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: SINET treatment with the mTOR inhibitor
RAD had no antiproliferative effect based on activation of pAKT and pERK1/2. A combinatorial approach using OCT
and RAD failed to overcome this escape phenomenon. However, differences in RAD response rates in individual NET
cell lines suggested that pretreatment identification of different tumor sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors could provide

Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are not well known, but they are as common as Hodgkin lymphoma and more
common than pancreatic, gastric, esophageal, and hepatobiliary cancers.1 Their prevalence is increasing, however, and
NETs now represent approximately 2% of all malignancies.2 The misconception that NETs follow a benign course has
also been debunked. Only a minority of cases are amenable to curative surgery,3 and approximately half of all patients will
succumb within 6 years of diagnosis.2 Antiproliferative pharmacological therapy is of limited efficacy, and new agents that
target proproliferative cellular pathways are under investigation.
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor) represents an important therapeutic target in several malignancies, and
mTOR pathway signaling is considered to play a crucial role in a majority of cancers.4,5 Recently, a combinatorial

Figure 1. (A, B) Schematic of the pathways assessed in the study is shown. Briefly, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)C1
leads to inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) via the S6K1 feedback loop (A). Targeting mTOR with the mTOR inhibitor
RAD001 (109 M) selectively inhibited the mTORC1 complex, whereas mTORC2 function was not affected (B, panel 2). Up-regulation of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R)–IGF-1–PI3K pathway increased activity of Ras–Raf–extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) (B, panel 1).

In contrast, mTOR associated with Rictor in the
mTORC2 complex responds to growth factor receptor
binding, which leads to full activation of AKT kinase by
phosphorylation at the Ser473 side.11,15,16 mTOR inhibitors (eg, rapamycin, everolimus [RAD001]) selectively inhibit mTORC1 at concentrations at the low nanomolar
range, mTORC2 inhibition generally requires doses in
the micromolar concentrations, levels that are 103-fold
higher than those achieved in clinical treatment.4,17 In
general, clinical trials performed with rapamycin derivatives have turned out to be less successful than predicted
by in vitro data. In recent studies, it has been demonstrated that a negative mTORC1/AKT feedback loop
increases AKT activity via an increase in receptor tyrosine
kinase (RTK)/insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1).18-22 In
addition, a negative feedback loop occurs via the
p70S6K–Ras pathway, which causes cross-activation of
the Ras–Raf–ERK pathway after mTOR inhibitor
treatment.23,24
High expression rates of phosphorylated (p)mTOR
have been demonstrated in poorly differentiated NETs,
suggesting a potential role of mTOR inhibitors in NET
treatment.25 Additionally, a comparative in vitro study in
NET cell lines of pancreatic, midgut, and bronchial origin
suggested feedback activation in the liver metastasis–
derived small intestinal NET (SINET) cell line GOT1.26
However, the phenomenon of mTOR inhibitor escape
has neither been examined in a primary tumor–derived
SINET cell line nor in the presence of a somatostatin analog. We hypothesized that in SINETs, the combination of
mTOR inhibition and a somatostatin analog would overcome any potential cell proliferation escape phenomena
and exceed the antiproliferative effect of either drug alone.
Accordingly, we investigated the effects of RAD001, the
somatostatin analog octreotide, or the combination of
both drugs on cell proliferation, activation of the PI3K–
AKT–mTOR pathway, activation of the Ras–Raf–ERK
pathway, and the production of growth factors and their
receptors in primary and metastatic SINET cell lines.

Chemicals
Octreotide LAR (OCT) and RAD001 (RAD) were a kind
gift from Novartis AG (Basel, Switzerland).
Proliferation Studies
2  105 cells/mL, seeded in 96-well plates at 100 lL were
stimulated with RAD (106 to 1012 M, n ¼ 6 wells/concentration) and OCT (106 to 1012 M, n ¼ 6 wells/concentration).29,30,33 After 72 hours of incubation, cell
viability was analyzed using MTT as described.33,34
Results were normalized to the unstimulated control, and
the effective half-maximal concentrations were calculated.
To evaluate the combination of OCT and RAD,
KRJ-I and H-STS cells were seeded as described above
and stimulated with OCT (106 M), RAD (109 M), or
the combination. Cell viability was measured after 24, 48,
and 72 hours using WST-1 cell proliferation reagent
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.35 Optical
density was quantified photospectrometrically at 450 nm
using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad 3500). Results (n ¼ 6)
were normalized to control, and effects between different
drugs were analyzed by way of unpaired t tests.
pAKT/AKT Signaling Pathway Analysis
After 24 hours of incubation, AKT signal activity was
evaluated in normal small intestinal EC cells and in the
KRJ-I, P-STS, H-STS, and L-STS cell lines using SuperArray CASE enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) kits (SA Biosciences, Frederick, Md) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.29,30
Protein Extraction
KRJ-I and H-STS cells (4  105 cells/mL) were seeded in
6-well plates (Falcon; BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and
treated with OCT (106 M), RAD (109 M) or the combination for 24 hours. After cells were harvested, wholecell lysates were prepared by adding 200 lL of ice-cold
cell lysis buffer (10 RIPA lysis buffer [Millipore, Billerica, Mass], complete protease inhibitor [Roche, Indianapolis, Ind], phosphatase inhibitor sets 1 and 2
[Calbiochem, Gibbstown, NJ], 100 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride [Roche], 200 mM Na3VO4 [Acros
Organics], 12.5 mg/mL sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS]
[American Bioanalytical, Natick, Mass]). Tubes were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 20 minutes, and supernatant protein was quantified (BCA protein assay kit; Thermo

Western Blot Analysis
Total protein lysates (20 lg) were denatured in SDS sample buffer, separated by way of SDS–polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (4, 10%), and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif, pore
size 0.45 mm). After blocking (5% bovine serum albumin
for 60 minutes at room temperature), membranes were
incubated with primary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, Mass) in 5% bovine serum albumin/
phosphate-buffered saline/Tween 20 overnight at 4 C,
then with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary
antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) for 60 minutes at
room temperature, and immunodetection was performed
using the Western Lightning Plus-ECL (PerkinElmer,
Mass). Blots were exposed on X-OMAT-AR films.36
Cross-detection between pAKT (Ser473) and AKT, phosphorylated tuberin (Thr1462) and tuberin, pp70S6K
(Thr389) and p70S6K, pmTOR (Ser2448) and mTOR,
pERK1/2 (Thr185, Tyr187) and ERK1/2, TGFb2-receptor (TGFb2-R), and phosphorylated IGF-1b receptor
(pIGF-1R) (Tyr1316) and IGF-1R was avoided by stripping the membranes. The optical density of the appropriately sized bands was measured using ImageJ software
(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md). The ratio
between phosphorylated protein and total protein was calculated, and total protein expression was reported relative
to that of b-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, Mo).
RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription
RNA was extracted from each cell line (1  106, n ¼ 6)
using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif) and cleaned
(Qiagen, RNeasy kit, Qiagen, Valencia, Calif). After conversion to complementary DNA (High Capacity cDNA
Archive Kit; Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, Calif),28,37
reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
analyses were performed using Assays-on-Demand and
the ABI 7900 Sequence Detection System.28,37 Primer
sets were obtained from Applied Biosystems, and PCR
mix on gels were performed to confirm presence of single
bands for each primer set. PCR data were normalized
using the DDCT method; ALG9 was used as a housekeeping gene.38
5-Hydroxytryptamine, Insulin-Like Growth
Factor 1, and Transforming Growth Factor b1
Secretion
Levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), insulin-like
growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and transforming growth factor
b1 (TGFb1) were analyzed using commercially available

4144

ELISA assays (5-HT, BA 10-0900, Rocky Mountain
Diagnostics; TGFb1, DB100B, R&D Systems; IGF-1,
R&D Systems).27,28 Briefly, cells were seeded into 6-well
plates (n ¼ 6) and stimulated with OCT (106 M), RAD
(109 M), or the combination, and agent levels were
measured after 24 hours.
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft
Excel and Prism 4 (GraphPad Software, San Diego,
Calif). Nonlinear regression analyses were used to indentify half-maximal inhibitory (IC50) concentrations. Cell
viability tests were analyzed using a Student t test; all other
data were assessed using 2-tailed, unpaired t tests.

RESULTS
mTOR and AKT Pathway Activation in
Untreated Cell Lines
Transcription of AKT and mTORC1

Transcript levels of AKT and mTORC1 were analyzed in normal EC cells and in primary tumor–derived
(KRJ-I, P-STS), lymph node metastatic (L-STS), and
liver metastatic cell lines (H-STS) using RT-PCR. No significant difference in AKT messenger RNA levels was
noted between normal EC cells and both primary tumor–
derived cell lines, whereas increased transcript levels were
determined in the lymph node and liver metastasis cell
lines (P < .05). In contrast, mTORC1 transcripts were
present at very low levels in normal EC cells but were significantly increased in each of the cell lines (P < .05)
(Fig. 1C, D).
Protein levels of total AKT as well as pAKT/AKT

We next quantified protein levels of AKT and determined the ratio of pAKT to total AKT. Levels of SINET
cell lines were compared with normal EC cells. AKT
protein was identified in all tumor cell lines and was
notably increased in metastatic cell lines (P < .05). The
ratio of pAKT/AKT was significantly elevated in all
tumor cell lines (P < .05) compared with normal EC cells
(Fig. 1E, F).

and OCT Administration
Dose-dependent effects of RAD and OCT on cell

72-hour cell viability. Targeting mTOR with RAD significantly inhibited viability (20%-50%; IC50<0.3 nM; P <
.05). This effect was most evident in the metastatic cell
lines (L-STS, IC50 ¼ 2.3  10 11 M; H-STS, IC50 ¼
2.1  1011 M; P < .05) with a maximum inhibitory
effect of 52  2% (Fig. 2A-D). After OCT administration, an antiproliferative effect was noted in the 2 primary
tumor-derived cell lines (KRJ-I, P-STS) and the lymph
node metastasis-derived cell line (L-STS) (KRJ-I, IC50 ¼
1.7  10 11 M; P-STS, IC50 ¼ 7.9  10 9 M; L-STS,
IC50 ¼ 1.1  108 M), with a maximum effect of 73 
6% and 82  4% (Fig. 2A-D); no effect was evident in
the liver metastatic cell line.
Effects of RAD in combination with OCT on cell
viability

To evaluate the efficiency of a dual inhibitory
approach targeting somatostatin receptors and mTOR,
effects of OCT and RAD were determined in KRJ-I, PSTS, L-STS, and H-STS cells. OCT (106 M) had a
modest inhibitory effect (5%-10% inhibition, P < .05)
on cell proliferation in KRJ-I and L-STS cells. In primary
tumor–derived cell lines, the combination of RAD (109
M) and OCT (106 M) was significantly more effective
(P < .05) than treatment with each agent alone. The
combinatorial treatment exhibited no significant effect in
the metastatic-derived cells lines L-STS and H-STS
(Fig. 2E-H).
Time response of RAD and OCT treatment on cell
viability

To examine the phenomenon of growth escape, the
antiproliferative effects of each agent were determined
in KRJ-I and H-STS cells after 24, 48, and 72 hours (Fig.
2I, J). After administration of OCT, a significant decrease
in cell viability was noted in the primary-derived cell line
(KRJ-I) (85  5%, P < .001), whereas no antiproliferative effect was obvious in the liver metastasis–derived cell
line (109  5%, P < .001). A significant decrease was
noted after RAD treatment in both tumor cell lines at 24
and 48 hours (KRJ-I, 78  4%, 47  4%; H-STS, 60 
5%, 55  3%; P < .001), but after 72 hours an increase
of cell viability was observed (KRJ-I, 95  5%; H-STS,
82  10%; P < .001). Combination of both drugs
enhanced antiproliferative effects in both tumor cell lines
at 24 and 48 hours of treatment (KRJ-I, 63  5%, 38 
0.6%; H-STS, 49  0.3%, 48  0.3%; P < .001). However, an increase of cell viability was noted after combinatorial treatment for 72 hours compared with 24 and 48

hours (KRJ-I, 78  9%; H-STS, 80  12%; P < .001).
An additional antiproliferative effect was only evident in
KRJ-I cells after combined treatment (P < .001).
mTOR and AKT Pathway Activation After
Treatment With RAD and OCT
Protein levels of mTOR, TSC2, p70S6K, ERK, AKT,
and IGF-1 receptor at 24 hours

Because one of the drawbacks of mTOR inhibition
is cross-reactivation of the AKT pathway as well as the
ERK1/2 pathway, we evaluated the effects of RAD, OCT,
and the combination on AKT, TSC2, p70S6K, ERK1/2,
and IGF-1R phosphorylation in KRJ-I and H-STS cells.
Effects on AKT activity.

A significant decrease in pAKT (Ser473) was noted
in KRJ-I cells after treatment with OCT and
OCTþRAD. This finding did not translate into differences in the pAKT/AKT ratio (a measure of pathway activation), indicating incomplete inhibition of pAKT/AKT
activity after RAD administration in this cell line (Fig. 3).
No effects were observed after OCT treatment compared
with untreated controls. In H-STS, a significant increase
in pAKT (Ser473) protein levels was determined after
administration of OCTþRAD and was accompanied by a
decrease in total AKT. The ratio of pAKT/AKT was significantly higher in RAD and OCTþRAD treated with
H-STS cells (141  14%, 183  34%; P < .05) (Fig. 4).
No effects were noted after OCT treatment.
Effects on TSC2 activity.

RAD and OCTþRAD significantly increased
pTSC2 (Thr1462) levels in KRJ-I cells and were accompanied by a decrease in total TSC2. The pTSC2/TSC2 ratio was significantly elevated after treatment with RAD
and OCTþRAD (539  92%, 868  121%; P < .05)
(Fig. 3). In H-STS cells, levels of pTSC2 (Thr1462) were
increased after RAD and OCTþRAD administration,
with a significant decrease in total protein. The ratio of
pTSC2/TSC2 was increased by RAD and OCTþRAD
(429  64%, 532  68%, P < .05) (Fig. 4). No significant differences for OCT were noted in either cell line.
Effects on mTOR activity.

In KRJ-I cells, a significant decrease in pmTOR
(Ser2448) was noted after RAD and OCTþRAD treatment
and was associated with a decrease in total protein levels.
The ratio of pmTOR/mTOR was significantly lower after
RAD and OCTþRAD (85  3%, 82  6%, P < .05)

compared with untreated controls (Fig. 3). In H-STS cells,
a significant decrease in pmTOR (Ser2448) was noted with

protein. The ratio of pmTOR/mTOR was significantly
decreased by RAD and OCTþRAD (85  4%, 82  3%,
P < .05) (Fig. 4). No significant effect was evident for
OCT in either cell line.
Effects on p70S6K activity.

A significant decrease in pp70S6K (Thr389) was
noted in KRJ-I cells after treatment with RAD and was
associated with a decrease in total protein. The ratio of
pp70S6K and p70S6K was significantly decreased by
OCTþRAD (42  2%, P < .05) (Fig. 3). In H-STS,
pp70S6K (Thr389) was decreased after RAD and
OCTþRAD administration along with a decrease in total
protein. No effect was observed for OCT treatment. A
significant reduction of pp70S6K/p70S6K ratio was
noted for RAD and OCTþRAD (73  10%, 64  1%;
P < .05) (Fig. 4). No effect was evident after OCT treatment in either cell line.
Effects on ERK1/2 activity.

A significant increase of pERK1/2 (Thr185,
Tyr187) was noted in KRJ-I cells after RAD and
OCTþRAD treatment, accompanied by a decrease in
total protein. The ratio of pERK1/2 and ERK1/2 was significantly increased by RAD and OCTþRAD (928 
71%, 1012  101%; P < .05) (Fig. 3). In H-STS cells, an
increase of pERK1/2 (Thr185, Tyr187) was observed after RAD and OCTþRAD administration, accompanied
by a decrease in total protein. The ratio of pERK1/2 and
ERK1/2 was increased after RAD and OCTþRAD treatment (Fig. 4). No effects were noted after OCT administration in either cell line.
Effects on IGF-1 receptor activity.

Whereas no significant effects of either agent were
noticed in KRJ-I cells, pIGF-1R levels (Tyr1316) were
significantly elevated in H-STS cells after RAD treatment,
accompanied by an increase in total IGF-1R protein (Fig.
5). After OCT administration, a decreased protein
amount of IGF-1R was evident. The ratio of pIGF-1R/
IGF-1R was significantly increased after RAD treatment
(128  15%, P < .05) (Fig. 5).

24 hours after treatment with OCT (106 M), RAD
(109 M), and OCTþRAD using RT-PCR. In KRJ-I
and H-STS cells, transcript levels for Ki67 were significantly decreased after treatment with RAD (53  1.2%,
P < .001; 86  11%, P < .05) and the combination of
RADþOCT (65  8.5%, P < .001; 87  12%, P <

administration alone (123  10%, P < .01; 124  8.2%,
P < .001) (Fig. 6A). After RAD treatment, a significant
increase in transcripts for mTOR (KRJ-I, 120  4.9%,
P < .05; H-STS, 126  4.1%, P < .001), AKT1 (KRJ-I,
119  9.3%; H-STS, 143  27%; P < .05), and MAPK1
(KRJ-I, 130  10%, P < .001; H-STS, 119  8%, P <
.01) levels were noted. In KRJ-I and H-STS cells, similar
observations were evident after the combinatorial treatment (mTOR, 128  13%, 135  16%, P < .05; AKT1,
124  14%, P < .05, 137  19%, P < .01; MAPK1, 132
 15%, 127  4.2%, P < .001) (Fig. 6B-D, F-H). No
significant differences were noted after OCT treatment
except for an increase in AKT1 levels in H-STS cells (148
 31%, P < .01) (Fig. 6G).
Growth Factor Secretion and Transcription in
SINET Cells After RAD and OCT Treatment
Effects of OCT (106 M), RAD (109 M) and the combination on 5-HT, IGF-1, and TGFb1 secretion were
evaluated in KRJ-I and H-STS cells using ELISA. A significant decrease in 5-HT secretion was evident in KRJ-I
cells treated with all compounds (OCT, 57  26%;
RAD, 63  27%; OCTþRAD, 68  23%; P < .05),
whereas only a significant effect of OCT was noted in HSTS (OCT, 52  26%; P < .05). IGF-1 secretion was significantly elevated in KRJ-I and H-STS cells by OCT
(128  21%, 113  8%; P < .05), RAD (141  29%,
118  12%; P < .05), and OCTþRAD (125  22%,

No significant effects in TGFb1 secretion were noted
(Fig. 7A-F).
Growth factor receptor transcripts for IGF-1R and

DISCUSSION
High expression rates of pmTOR have been demonstrated
in poorly differentiated NETs, suggesting a potential role
of mTOR inhibitors in NET treatment.25 In the current
study, the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway was significantly
elevated in SINETs in both primary tumors as well as in
lymph node and liver metastasis, suggesting a crucial role
in tumor proliferation and progression. The role of this
pathway is likely neoplasia-related, because normal EC
cells exhibit very low expression of transcripts for AKT
and mTORC1, as well as for AKT signaling. SINETs are
therefore potentially treatable by targeting the mTOR
with selective inhibitors. A combinatorial approach with
the somatostatin analog OCT, which has been demonstrated to lengthen time to tumor progression,39 could
potentially result in an increased antiproliferative effect in

SINETs. In the current study, we present the effects of
RAD and OCT in primary tumor–derived as well as
lymph node–derived and liver metastasis–derived SINET
cell lines.
OCT only decreased cell viability in primary tumors
and lymph node metastasis, whereas the antiproliferative
effect of RAD was noted in every cell line regardless of the
site; this effect was more evident in metastatic cell lines
compared with primary tumors. This finding suggests
that a combinatorial approach of OCT and RAD might
result in an augmented antiproliferative effect in disseminated NET disease. However, an increased antiproliferative response using OCT and RAD in combination was
only evident in the primary tumor cell line, whereas no
effect was noted in the metastases.
We next evaluated mechanistic basis of the cellular
responses by assessing cell viability at 24, 48, and 72 hours
using RAD, OCT, and OCTþRAD at concentrations
typically reached in clinical treatment (RAD, 109 M;
OCT, 106 M). Whereas a significant decrease in cell viability was noted in the primary-derived cell line KRJ-I
treated with OCT, no antiproliferative effect was noted in
the liver metastasis–derived cell line H-STS, indicating
that treatment with OCT demonstrates a beneficial antiproliferative effect only in the primary-derived tumor.
RAD exhibited a significant antiproliferative response after 24 and 48 hours in primary and liver metastasis–

derived cell lines. However, an increase in cell viability to
levels similar to those at pretreatment was evident after 72
hours of RAD administration, suggesting that tumor cells
escape biotherapeutic treatment. The combinatorial
approach did not reverse this growth-regulatory escape
phenomenon. These findings indicate that targeting
mTOR in SINETs subsequently results in growth escape,
either through feedback mechanisms within the PI3K–
AKT–mTOR pathway or through cross-activation of
other crucial cell survival pathways.
A negative feedback loop by inhibition of mTORC1
has been demonstrated to increase levels and activity of
the growth factor receptor adaptor protein, IRS-1, which
was mediated via the mTORC1 target p70S6K, resulting
in Ras–Raf–ERK pathway activation.19,24 In our study,
targeting SINETs with RAD significantly decreased phosphorylated mTOR and lowered the ratio of phosphorylated versus total mTOR protein in the primary tumor cell
line KRJ-I, as well as in the liver metastasis cell line HSTS, an effect that was accompanied by a decrease in
pp70S6K. Due to the deregulated negative feedback loop
of p70S6K, a significant increase of pERK1/2 activity was
evident in both cell lines after RAD administration (Figure 1B, panel 1). Our findings demonstrate tumor cell
escape in RAD-treated SINETs by cross-activation of the
ERK1/2 pathway resulting in resistance to mTOR inhibitor treatment.
Whereas mTORC1 is preferentially inhibited at
rapamycin concentrations in the nM range, mTORC2
can only be successfully blocked by dose rates at the
micromolar level.17 mTORC2 plays a crucial role in an
mTORC1/AKT feedback loop by selective activation of
ATK at Ser473, and treatment with mTOR inhibitors has
been demonstrated to cause a strong inhibition, a partial
inhibition, or an increase in AKT phosphorylation.16,40
In the SINET cell lines, AKT phosphorylation as well as
pAKT/AKT levels were significantly increased in H-STS
cells, whereas in treated KRJ-I cells, pAKT levels exhibited
no significant differences compared with controls. This
finding was accompanied by a significant increase in
pTSC2 levels in both tumor cell lines, which has been
demonstrated to activate mTORC1 via Rheb.13,14,16
Increased transcript levels of mTOR, AKT1, and MAPK1
confirmed these western blot results. Consequently, targeting mTORC1 with RAD in the nM range increased
mTORC2 activity, which resulted in either activation (HSTS) or incomplete inhibition (KRJ-I) of AKT phosphorylation, with consequent resistance to mTOR inhibitor
treatment (Figure 1B, panel 2). Overall, H-STS cells were

4152

identified to be completely insensitive to RAD treatment
and exhibited higher feedback activation compared with
KRJ-I cells; this finding was confirmed by a significant
decrease of Ki67 transcripts in the primary versus metastatic cell line. This individual tumor cell response is suggestive of site-specific (localized versus metastatic)
differences in the pathobiological function of SI NETs
and emphasizes the importance of an individualized treatment based on a biotherapeutic (signal transduction)
response profile.
Treatment with OCT demonstrated no significant
differences in any of the signaling pathway protein levels
measured, suggesting that the antiproliferative effects of
OCT, though relatively modest (<10%), are not based
on perturbations in the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway.
Interestingly, the combination approach demonstrated no
significant difference in PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in
either cell line, confirming that somatostatin receptor activation does not affect signaling through these pathways.
Activation of AKT as well as ERK1/2 by targeting
mTORC1 is caused through up-regulation of growth factor and growth factor receptor synthesis and secretion.19,24 Serotonin is known to play an autocrine role in
SINET proliferation33,41 and was significantly decreased
by any of the 3 treatments in KRJ-I cells and only after
OCT treatment in H-STS cells. Importantly, a significant
increase in IGF-1 secretion and receptor transcription was
evident in both cell lines; increased receptor protein levels
as well as receptor activation were noted in the metastatic
cell line. Because SINETs are known to respond to IGF-1
with increased proliferation,42 these data demonstrate
that up-regulation of IGF-1 receptors and IGF-1 secretion results in growth factor–mediated tumor cell escape,
particularly in liver metastasis. In preliminary analyses, we
identified up-regulation of IGF-I receptor as well as phosphorylation of IGF-IR and AKT (at Ser473) in a liver metastasis from a NET patient treated with OCT
(unpublished data). This particular lesion had a Ki67
>2%, suggesting that faster proliferating tumors may not
be as amenable to biotherapeutics as slow-growing lesions.
The antiproliferative effects of somatostatin analogs noted
in the PROMID study was limited to slow-growing (Ki67
<2%) tumors that were largely indolent.39 In addition, it
is unclear how an analog may function together with an
mTOR inhibitor in this setting. Overall, liver metastases
appear to have the machinery to escape biotherapeutic
intervention. Primary tumors, in contrast, may function
differently. Interestingly, no significant effect on IGF-1
receptor protein expression was noted in the primary cell

line (KRJ-I), although an increase in IGF-1 receptor transcript levels was evident. We interpret this finding as
reflecting either a delayed feedback response in the primary tumor (partially sensitive to RAD) or involvement
of the TGFb pathway in growth regulatory escape based
on increased messenger RNA transcripts of TGFb2 receptor and TGFb1 secretion noted only in the primary tumor. Primary tumors respond to TGFb1 with
proliferation, an effect we have reported previously.36
In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that both
primary and liver metastasis–derived SINET cell lines
escape from mTOR inhibitor treatment based on a dual
feedback activation of AKT and ERK1/2 via an increase
in RTK receptors and growth factor secretion. Different
response rates to the agent were identified, however, indicating the importance of an individualized tumor
response profile to biotherapeutic agents. Treatment with
OCT had no impact on the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway
in both cell lines and failed to overcome the feedback activation. Dual targeting mTOR and ERK1/2 might provide an alternative method to reverse the feedback crossactivation and re-establish the antiproliferative effect of
mTOR inhibitors in SINETs.
