ABSTRACT
Leukemic cells from Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) patients interact with
stromal cells of the surrounding microenvironment. Mesenchymal Stromal Cells
(MSCs) represent the main population in CLL marrow stroma, which may play a key
role for disease support and progression. In this study we evaluated whether MSCs
influence in vitro CLL cell survival. MSCs were isolated from the bone marrow of 46 CLL
patients and were characterized by flow cytometry analysis. Following co-culture of
MSCs and leukemic B cells, we demonstrated that MSCs were able to improve leukemic
B cell viability, this latter being differently dependent from the signals coming from
MSCs. In addition, we found that the co-culture of MSCs with leukemic B cells induced
an increased production of IL-8, CCL4, CCL11, and CXCL10 chemokines.
As far as drug resistance is concerned, MSCs counteract the cytotoxic effect of
Fludarabine/Cyclophosphamide administration in vivo, whereas they do not protect
CLL cells from the apoptosis induced by the kinase inhibitors Bafetinib and Ibrutinib.
The evidence that leukemic clones are conditioned by environmental stimuli suggest
new putative targets for therapy in CLL patients.

INTRODUCTION

[10, 11], suggesting that the leukemic B cells survival
advantage could be attributed not only to intrinsic defects
of apoptotic mechanisms but also to signals delivered by
accessory cells at the sites of the disease activity. In tissue
microenvironment, CLL B cells reside in close contact
with T lymphocytes, stromal cells, mesenchymal stromal
cells (MSCs), endothelial cells, follicular dendritic cells
and macrophages. Interactions among these components
of the microenvironment regulate the trafficking, survival,
and proliferation of leukemic B cells in a way that depends
both on direct cell-cell contact and/or on the exchange of
soluble factors [12]. Moreover, once resident in stromal
environment, CLL cells are protected from different
therapeutic interventions [13-15].

The accumulation of CD19+/CD5+/CD23+ B cells
is a peculiar hallmark of B cell chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL) [1]. Despite a remarkable phenotypic
and cytological homogeneity, CLL is characterized by
extremely variable clinical course related to different
prognostic factors including the mutational status of the
immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region (IgVH) [24], expression of CD38 and ZAP70 markers [5, 6] and
specific cytogenetic alterations [7-9]. Although leukemic
cells show prolonged lifespan in the peripheral blood,
secondary lymphoid organs and bone marrow (BM),
they rapidly undergo spontaneous apoptosis in vitro

Among bone marrow stromal cells, MSCs show
a bidirectional cross-talking with neoplastic B cells.
Leukemic cells are supported by stromal cells and, in
turn, are also able to activate and induce stromal cell to
proliferate and release several mediators (i.e., CXCL12,
CXCL13, CCL19 and CCL21) which sustain the ongoing
process [16-18]. These interactions drive CLL B cells
into tissue microenvironment, where malignant cells
experience the survival and proliferation signals mediated
by the B cell receptor (BCR) and other pathways [15].
Nevertheless, these complex cellular and molecular
mechanisms are not yet completely defined. Although in
healthy subjects MSCs represent a small fraction of the
stromal cell population, immunohistochemistry studies
performed in patients with several lymphoproliferative
diseases showed that in situ αSMA+ mesenchymal
stromal cells, which represent the in vivo counterpart of
MSCs, are the dominant stromal cell population in CLL
microenvironment [19]. These observations support
a crucial role of MSCs on the mechanisms favoring
malignant cells and disease progression in CLL.
In the last years, the modulation of tumor
microenvironment is becoming a promising therapeutic
strategy in CLL treatment, demonstrated by the use of
an increased number of compounds (i.e. thalidomide,
lenalidomide, plerixafor and natalizumab) [20, 21],
affecting molecules involved in the compartimentalization
of tumor cells. More recently, several small molecules
have been developed to inhibit a variety of kinases in
the BCR pathway, including Lyn, Syk, Btk and PI3K,
which are crucial not only for the activation of multiple
survival pathways (such as Akt, Erk, NF-kB) but also for
chemokine-mediated migration and adhesion of B cells
in the microenvironment [22]. Thus, the understanding
of the interactions between CLL B cells and the
microenvironment is mandatory to define more effective
therapies for CLL. In this context, the main aim of this
study was to investigate the in vitro impact of MSCs on
CLL B cell survival in order to verify whether MSCs
protect leukemic B cells from spontaneous apoptosis
both at basal conditions and after in vivo Fludarabine and
Cyclophosphamide containing regimen therapy. We also
tested the effect of two kinase inhibitors, Bafetinib (dual
BCR-Abl/Lyn inhibitor) and Ibrutinib (Btk inhibitor),
known to reduce neoplastic B cell viability in vitro [23],
on CLL B cells in presence of MSCs. Moreover, the
investigation of soluble factors, mainly cytokines and
chemokines, which could be involved in leukemic cell
survival, was performed. Our data clearly demonstrated
that MSCs display a pro-survival effect on leukemic B
cells from CLL patients and that CLL clones displayed a
variable degree of responsiveness to microenviromental
stimuli, suggesting that same clones are dependent and
other are independent from MSC pro-survival capability.
This observation might be relevant in order to identify
patients who may benefit of compounds targeting CLL

microenvironment.

RESULTS
Mesenchymal stromal cells from CLL patients
display phenotypic profile and differentiation
capability of MSCs from normal subjects
MSCs were obtained from the bone marrow of 46
CLL patients by plastic adhesion as previously described
[24, 25]. The adherent fraction leads to the formation of
high proliferating spindle-shaped colonies, reaching the
confluence in 30 days (Figure S1A). Flow cytometry
analysis showed that MSCs were positive for CD90,
CD73, CD105, and negative for CD14, CD34, CD45
and CD31 (Figure S1B). MSC ability to differentiate
in adipocytes and osteocytes was tested using specific
conditioned media. Adipogenic differentiation was
demonstrated by the detection of lipid vesicles in the
cytoplasm of (pre)adipocytes, stained with Oil Red.
Osteogenic differentiation was documented by the
increased expression of mRNA coding for Core Binding
Factor 1 (CBFA1) and the deposition of mineralized
matrix, shown by the Von Kossa staining (Figure S1C).
The cell adhesion, the immunophenotype and the
differentiation ability of stromal cells generated in our
cultures are in accordance to the criteria required for MSC
characterization [26, 27].

MSCs from CLL patients support in vitro
neoplastic B cell survival
We tested the effect of MSCs on the survival of
leukemic B cells obtained from 30 CLL patients and
normal B cells from 11 healthy donors. The assays were
performed incubating leukemic and normal B lymphocytes
in contact with a confluent layer of MSCs (20:1 ratio);
CLL B cell viability was assessed at 3, 5 and 7 days using
Annexin V staining. As shown in Figure 1A, leukemic
B cells underwent apoptosis when cultured in medium
alone; their survival was rescued following co-culture
with MSCs (13.3%±13.2% CLL B cells in medium alone
vs 59.2%±17.1% in presence of MSCs, after 7 days; p <
0.0001). The same pro-survival effect was observed using
both autologous and allogeneic MSCs (data not shown). In
addition, MSCs displayed a higher protective effect with
respect to the human stromal cell line HS-5 (59.2%±17.1%
with MSCs vs 45.9% ± 15.4% with HS-5; p < 0.01). After
7 days of culture, normal B cell survival with MSCs
was 34.9%±15.7% vs 6.7%±4.3% in medium alone (p <
0.001) (Figure 1B), pointing out that MSC display a major
protective effect on malignant B cells. MSCs from healthy
donors rescued CLL B cells from apoptosis as well as

in which the addition of MSCs did not affect leukemic
cell viability (the group defined “independent” from
microenvironment, Figure 2B, right panel). We showed
that this behaviour is not due to MSC features, since we
did not find any differences using MSCs obtained from
different patients (Figure 2C), while three different CLL
clones exhibited different pattern of PARP cleavage in the
presence of the same MSC line (completely abrogated in
the first and second clone and still present in the third,
Figure 2D). Finally, we correlated the 15 dependent and
12 independent patients with some prognostic factors for
CLL, such as IgVH mutational status, CD38 and ZAP70
expression, and genomic aberrations (13q-, 17p-, 11qdeletion and 12+) (Figure S2). We did not observed any
significant correlation between the different groups of
patients. Clinical and biological features of patients are
reported in Table 2.

CLL clones show different sensitivity to MSC prosurvival signals
Considering the heterogeneity of CLL B cell viability
in the presence of MSCs (Figure 2A), we evaluated the
PARP cleavage (generating an 89kDa fragment) as a
marker of apoptosis in 27 CLL patient samples after 7 day
co-culture of leukemic B cells with and without MSCs.
On the basis of PARP cleavage we identified two different
patterns: 1) one observed in a group of 15 patients in
which leukemic B cells died following culture in medium
alone, while they were rescued from apoptosis following
culture with MSCs (the group was defined as “dependent”
from microenvironment, Figure 2B, left panel); 2) a
second pattern observed in a group of 12 CLL patients

B. The total cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and detected with anti-PARP and anti-βactin. The figure shows a representative case of neoplastic B cells obtained from CLL patients (CLL#) co-cultured with MSCs (MSC#);
CLL clones displaying the cleaved PARP after 7 days of culture, but showing the full length protein in presence of MSCs were classified
as dependent (n = 15, left panel). CLL clones displaying the full length PARP with and without the presence of MSCs were classified as
independent (n = 12, right panel). C. Representative cases of CLL B cells (CLL#) co-cultured with MSCs derived from different CLL

medium (MSC-CM) significantly increases CLL B cell
migration (651±543 migrated cells in medium alone vs
2,809±1,318 migrated cells in MSC-CM, p < 0.0001)
(Figure 3B).

To discriminate between the role of cell-cell contact
and soluble factors in the anti-apoptotic effect of MSCs,
we cultured CLL B cells in direct contact to MSCs or in
presence of MSCs separated by a porous transwell (TW)
insert. After 7 days of culture, the viability of 12 CLL
samples co-cultured with MSCs both in direct contact
and following TW was 61.5%±18.3% and 47.5%±7.8%
(p = 0.07), respectively, suggesting that both cell-contact
and soluble factors contribute to the anti-apoptotic
effect (Figure 3A). As cell migration is concerned, we
demonstrated that the presence of MSC-conditioned

CLL B cells modulate the cytokine secretion
profile of MSCs
In order to better define the signals exchanged
between leukemic B cells and MSCs, a multiplex
cytokine analysis was performed on supernatants obtained
following culture of CLL B cells alone, MSCs alone and a
combination of CLL B cell with MSCs. The quantification

B cell/MSC co-cultures induce an increase (expressed as
Fold Induction, FI) for most of the assessed molecules,
being more evident for IL-8, CXCL10, CCL4 and CCL11.
Particularly, these four molecules resulted up-regulated
normalizing their concentration both on supernatant of
MSCs alone (IL-8 10.6 FI, CCL4 148.6 FI, CCL11 6.7 FI
and CXCL10 49.7 FI, Figure 4C) and on supernatant of
CLL B cells alone (IL-8 5.8 FI, CCL4 1.8 FI, CCL11 6.9
FI and CXCL10 4411 FI, Figure 4D).

Interestingly, the above mentioned cytokines
reached similar concentrations when the co-cultures were
carried out in the presence of leukemic and normal B
cells (Figure 5A). The only exception is represented by
CXCL10, whose up-regulation was detected only during
MSC/CLL B cell co-cultures, as confirmed by ELISA
assay (Figure 5B). Finally, we tested the modulation of
the secretion profile of leukemic B cells culture in the
presence of MSC conditioned medium (MSC-CM) to
assess how the factors released by MSCs can influence

At the same time, we performed an in vitro parallel
experiment assessing the MSC protective role on CLL
cells exposed to the same compounds used for in vivo
therapy. Leukemic B cells purified from 8 CLL untreated
patients were pre-incubated for 3 and 12 hours with FLU

used an in vitro co-culture system that employed leukemic

one cycle of Fludarabine (FLU)/ Cyclophosphamide (Cy)
therapy. As shown in Figure 6A, the presence of MSCs
provide a significant protection from apoptosis in CLL B
cells with respect to neoplastic cells cultured in medium
alone; the viability ranged from 55.2%±18.2% with
MSCs vs 9.4%±13.6% without MSCs, p < 0.0001, before
in vivo treatment and from 34.2%±21.6% with MSCs vs

MSCs from CLL patients do not protect leukemic
B cells from apoptosis induced by kinase
inhibitors

MSCs preserved CLL B cells from drug-induced apoptosis
(after 3h pre-treatment and 7 day co-culture, neoplastic
B cell viability, 27%±20% with MSCs vs 3.6%±3.4%
without MSCs, p < 0.05; after 12h pre-treatment and 7 day
co-culture, 25.1%±20.3% with MSCs vs 0.86%±0.69%
without MSCs, p < 0.05). The same pattern was observed
following co-culture of CLL B cells and MSCs with
FLU+Cy for 3, 5 and 7 days without pre-treatment (after 7
days, neoplastic B cell viability, 9.8%±4.5% with MSCs vs
1.8%±1.3% without MSCs, p < 0.01) (Figure 6C).

Previous studies [28, 29] and our data above
reported demonstrated that MSCs can protect CLL B cells
from drug-induced apoptosis. We next studied the effect
of Bafetinib and Ibrutinib on the survival of neoplastic
B cells obtained from 12 CLL patients cultured with and
without MSCs. Leukemic B cell viability was assessed
at 3, 5 and 7 days using Annexin V staining. We found
that the presence of MSCs was not enough to inhibit
Bafetinib and Ibrutinib induced apoptosis of neoplastic B
cells (Figure 7A). In fact, after 7 day co-cultures, CLL B
cell viability was 85.7%±4.1% in the absence of kinase
inhibitors, 53.9%±17.2% in the presence of Bafetinib (p

The data were also confirmed by western blotting analysis
of PARP protein, indicating that, although the presence
of MSCs, the addition of Bafetinib and Ibrutinib induced
leukemic B cell in vitro apoptosis (Figure 7B, row a). To
better understand the molecular mechanism by which
the two inhibitors affect neoplastic B cell survival, we
evaluated the phosphorylation status of Lyn (the tyrosine
kinase that sustains the neoplastic clone survival through
its constitutive activation) [30, 31] and ERK (a protein
involved in BCR signaling, CXCL12/CXCR4 axis and
responsible for the reduced apoptosis and the migration
of CLL cells beneath stromal cells) [32]. We found
that the treatment with Bafetinib considerably turns off
Lyn phosphorylation at Tyr396 active site although the
presence of MSCs; the same effect was also observed after
treating CLL B cells with Ibrutinib (Figure 7B, row b).
Both inhibitors are able to reduce ERK phosphorylation
in leukemic B cells cultured with MSCs with respect to
untreated controls (Figure 7B, row d).
Moreover, we determined the effect of both kinase
inhibitors on the survival of CLL B cells following
engagement of BCR with anti-IgM. The pre-incubation

viability (Figure S4A); the latter data were confirmed by
western blotting analyses of PARP, Lyn and ERK (Figure
S4B).
In addition, on the base of the cleavage pattern
of PARP protein, we divided the 12 patients treated
with Bafetinib and Ibrutinib into “dependent” and
“independent” groups showing no differences between
the two groups on CLL B cell viability and Lyn as well
as ERK de-phosphorylation (data not shown). This set
of experiments suggest that kinase inhibitors mediated
cytotoxicity independently from the protective effect of
the microenvironment.

Bafetinib and Ibrutinib do not reduce neoplastic
B cell migration to bone marrow stroma
By chemotaxis assay, we evaluated the effect of
Bafetinib and Ibrutinib kinase inhibitors on the crosstalking between CLL B cells and bone marrow MSCs.
The pre-treatment of neoplastic B cells with Bafetinib
and Ibrutinib did not inhibit the chemotaxis induced by
MSC-CM and the number of migrated cells significantly
increased with respect to basal migration (8,858±7,920

Interactions between chemokines and their receptors
mediate cell migration. CLL B cells express high levels of
CXCR4, CCR7, CXCR5 and CXCR3 chemokine receptors
[33, 34]. We investigated whether kinase inhibitors
regulate chemokine receptor expression on neoplastic B
cells cultured in the presence and absence of MSCs. The
two kinase inhibitors affect receptor expression in different
ways (Figure S5). In particular, CXCR4 was increased by
the treatment with Bafetinib and Ibrutinib, while CCR7
was reduced by Bafetinib; at the same time, CXCR5 was

affected only by Ibrutinib and the two kinase inhibitors do
not show a significant influence on CXCR3 expression,
suggesting that their action may be carried out mostly by
the receptors involved in the process of CLL homing. The
data are expressed as MFI and summarized in Table 3.

with Bafetinib and Ibrutinib. We found that the two
inhibitors were able to significantly reduce CLL B cell
pseudoemperipolesis. In fact, the percentage of neoplastic
B cells adherent to the stromal layer was 7.7%±3.8% in
the absence of inhibitors, 2.5%±3.0% with Bafetinib (p
< 0.01), and 3.3%±2.4% with Ibrutinib (p < 0.05) (Figure
9A). The phase-contrast photomicrographs displayed in
Figure 9B illustrate the effect of the pre-treatment of CLL
B cells with the two molecules, highlighting a marked
reduction of neoplastic cell adhesion to the MSC layer
in the presence of inhibitors as compared to untreated
controls (alone). Since CD49d plays a critical role in cell
adhesion and increases the ability of malignant cells to
access to protective niches [35], we addressed the effect of
the two kinase inhibitors on its expression on CLL B cell
surface, demonstrating that the treatment with Bafetinib
and Ibrutinib significantly decreases CD49d expression in
co-culture with MSCs (MFI ratio 0.87±0.12 Bafetinib, p
< 0.05, and 0.89±0.05 Ibrutinib, p < 0.01) (Figure 9C).

CLL B cell samples that underwent spontaneous apoptosis
in medium alone, but were rescued from apoptosis
following exposure to MSCs. On the contrary, the second
group identified CLL samples whose viability was high
when cultured both in medium alone and in the presence
of MSCs, indicating that these CLL clones were able
to survive independently from signals coming from the
microenvironment. In terms of survival, we observed that
each CLL clone responded in the same manner to different
MSCs samples, suggesting that the heterogeneity of
leukemic clones is likely to be related to intrinsic features
of leukemic B cells rather than to external stimuli.
The increase of leukemic B cell survival in the
presence of MSCs might be mediated by soluble factors
and/or cell-cell contact. Our results demonstrated that both
soluble factors and cell-cell contacts are able to support
neoplastic B cell viability. Survival factors counteracting
in vitro apoptosis of CLL B cells have been reported
in the past [13, 39], but the humoral/cellular factors
responsible for the pro-survival effect in vivo had not been
yet identified. By a multiplex cytokine assay, we found
that the MSC/leukemic cell co-culture system induced
an increase for many of the cytokines/chemokines tested,
the strongest being represented by IL-8, CCL4, CCL11
and CXCL10. Although the involvement of IL-8 and
CCL4 in CLL leukemic cell survival and growth has been
already reported in the literature [40-44], our findings
confirm these data and extend the observations on CCL11
and CXCL10 production. In particular, the addition of
MSCs to leukemic B cells up-regulates the level of these
two molecules. Regarding CCL11, this effect is not a
peculiar finding in malignant B cells since normal B cells
showed the same pattern of secretion; more interestingly,
CXCL10 is exclusively produced when MSCs were cocultured with malignant B cells but not with normal B
lymphocytes, supporting a key role for this chemokine in
CLL progression. The basal production of CXCL10, in
fact, was very low in the supernatants of CLL leukemic
B cells and of MSCs cultured alone, while we found a
marked increase after co-culture. In light of the fact that
CXCL10 receptor, CXCR3, is constitutively expressed on
CLL B cell surface [33], these data stress the importance
of the interconnection between chemokine receptor
signaling and stimuli coming from the microenvironment.
Furthermore, we demonstrated that MSCs were
able to rescue leukemic B cells from apoptosis also when
they have been previously exposed to in vivo Fludarabine
(FLU) and Cyclophosphamide (Cy) containing
regimen. These data point out the protective role of
microenvironment, not only toward neoplastic in vitro B
cells [28], but also on apoptosis induced by the in vivo
administration of the chemotherapy.
In the last few years, the observation of the key role
of tumor microenvironment and immune dysfunctions
in leukemic cells accumulation prompted the use of a
number of compounds targeting CLL microenvironment.

DISCUSSION
In this study MSCs from bone marrow of 46 CLL
patients, co-cultured to mimic the neoplastic in vivo
microenvironment, were isolated and characterized. We
demonstrated that MSCs support in vitro leukemic B cell
survival more efficiently than the stromal cell line HS-5
[36]. In the last years, several studies tried to elucidate the
role of stromal cells in CLL B cell survival, and primary
bone marrow stromal cells have been shown to be effective
in inhibiting apoptosis of cultured CLL [37] and acute
lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) cells [38]. In these reports,
the in vitro co-culture systems used were represented by
layers of marrow cells, including fibroblasts, macrophages
and fat cells, or layers of immortalized cell lines, but not
from a selected and well defined cell population.
Our data show that CLL B cells are susceptible to
the anti-apoptotic effect of MSCs, favoring neoplastic B
cell survival in vitro for at least 7 days. These results are
noteworthy considering that CLL B cells spontaneously
undergo apoptosis once they have been removed from
the in vivo microenvironment and placed in suspension
cultures without supportive stroma. Despite CLL
B cells display typical phenotype and cytogenetic
abnormalities, the disease is quite heterogeneous in terms
of clinical courses, suggesting that each leukemic clone
is characterized by intrinsic features that might affect the
interactions with the surrounding environment. In this
context, we found a great variability in CLL cells survival
when co-cultured with MSCs, since the fraction of living
leukemic B cells ranged from 40% to 76%. The analysis
of the cleavage pattern of PARP protein detected in CLL
patients after 7 day co-culture with MSCs allowed us to
distinguish patients into two groups on the basis of their
dependence/independence to microenvironmental prosurvival stimuli. The first group is represented by those

Different drugs used for CLL treatment have been
demonstrated to induce in vitro apoptosis of CLL B cells
whereas their effect is reduced when administered in vivo,
probably related to the presence of pro-survival stimuli
coming from surrounding environment. Therefore, it is
mandatory to test the effect of new therapeutic agents
in the presence of microenvironmental partners (such as
MSCs) which might interfere with the biological effects
of the drug, allowing the identification of subgroups of
patients who may benefit from treatments targeting the
cross-talk with supportive cells at the sites of the disease.
For this reason, we tested in our co-culture system the
effect of inhibitors targeting different kinases involved
in BCR pathway, such as Bafetinib and Ibrutinib, the
latter known to reduce CLL B cell migration and to
induce in vitro apoptosis [23, 45]. We found that both
Bafetinib and Ibrutinib were able to induce leukemic cell
apoptosis independently from MSCs presence, through a
mechanism involving a de-phosphorylation of Lyn and
ERK kinases, two relevant proteins in CLL pathogenesis.
In contrast, these inhibitors did not affect B cell migration
toward MSC-conditioned medium, rich in cytokines and
chemokines, suggesting that these cells do not lose their
ability to move toward a protective niche. Migration is
mediated by the interaction between chemokines and their
receptors, i.e. CXCR4, CCR7, CXCR5 and CXCR3, these
latter being overexpressed on CLL B cells [33, 34]. In this
work, we observed that, in malignant B cells co-cultured
with MSCs, Bafetinib significantly decreased CCR7
expression, involved in lymphocyte entry the lymph node,
and up-regulated CXCR4 which, instead, is engaged in the
trafficking in lymphoid organs. CXCR4 up-regulation was
also observed following in vitro treatment with Ibrutinib.
Although it still remains unknown the exact mechanism
of CXCR4 up-regulation, we found that the use of kinase
inhibitors induced modifications in chemokine receptors.
Since cell-cell contact with stromal cells is crucial for
CLL B cell survival, we tested the effect of Bafetinib and
Ibrutinib on neoplastic B cell adhesion to an MSC layer
finding a significant reduction of cell adhesion through a
down-modulation of CD49d expression. Taking together,
these results suggest that Bafetinib and Ibrutinib not
only are able to reduce CLL B cell viability by blocking
molecules important for cell survival, but they could
interfere with the interactions between chemokines and
their receptors and with cell-cell contact.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that MSCs
co-culture represents a reproducible in vitro system with
functional similarities to in vivo bone marrow conditions,
pointing out that the heterogeneity of the disease is
reflected also in CLL B cell capacity to respond to
favorable signals from MSCs. Moreover, as a result of the
ability of kinase inhibitors to inactivate enzymes in the
BCR signaling pathway, which are aberrantly activated
in CLL, leukemic B cells lose not only their ability
to proliferate and survive but also to interact with the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

protective bone marrow microenvironment, a necessary
condition to aim the eradication of the disease. In addition,
for the first time, we herein demonstrated that Bafetinib
presents a mechanism of action quite similar to that of
Ibrutinib in blocking CLL B cell-MSC cross-talk. Our
findings on the role of MSCs and their effect on neoplastic
B lymphocytes open a new scenario to better identify the
most effective drugs or drug combinations targeting the
pro-survival cross-talk between neoplastic B cells and
marrow elements.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethic statement
Primary CLL samples were obtained after informed
consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki. The ethic
approval for our study was obtained from the local ethic
committee of “Regione Veneto on chronic lymphocytic
leukemia”.

Mesenchymal stromal cell long-term cultures
Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) were isolated
from iliac crest bone marrow (BM) aspirate of 46 CLL
patients (Table 1) under local anesthesia and diluted 1:3 in
Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS1X) (Euroclone; Milan,
Italy). BM mononuclear cells (BMMCs) were isolated by
F/H (Amersham Biosciences) centrifugation and plated
at density 1,000cells/cm2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) (Euroclone) with 1,000mg/ml glucose,
L-glutamine, 10% heated inactivated fetal bovine serum
(FBS) and 100U/ml Penicillin, 100µg/ml Streptomicin
(Life Technologies; Paisley, UK). BMMC suspensions
were incubated at 37°C in humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2 and allowed to attach for 7 days; at
this time-point, non-adherent fraction was discarded and
adherent cells were fed every week with fresh medium.
These cells were maintained until confluence, then they
were removed by Accutase (Sigma-Aldrich; Milan, Italy),
centrifuged and diluted 1:3 for subsequent expansion in
25cm3 flasks or cryopreserved for future uses.

Human primary samples
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
were obtained from heparinised venous blood of 45 CLL
patients (Table 2) and 11 normal donors, representative of
the adult healthy population. PBMCs of the patients were
isolated by density-gradient centrifugation over FicollHypaque (F/H; Amersham Biosciences; Buckinghamshire,
UK). Where necessary, further purifications were
performed. Finally all the samples utilized had a content

of neoplastic B cells greater than 95%. Untouched
peripheral blood B cells from normal donors were
isolated using the RosetteSep isolation kit for B cells
(STEMCELL Technologies; Vancouver, Canada). The
purity of the obtained peripheral blood cells was at least
95% (CD19+), as assessed by flow cytometry. All patients
had a confirmed diagnosis of CLL by NCI Working Group
Definition [46] and were classified according to the Rai
staging system [47].

in 12 well plate with DMEM until confluence and then
placed in RPMI medium (Euroclone), prior the addiction
of B lymphocytes. Leukemic cells were collected after
3, 5 and 7 days, leaving intact the adherent layer, and
examined for apoptosis status by staining with Annexin
V-FITC accordingly to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Immunostep; Salamanca, Spain). Briefly, aliquots of
5x105 cells were harvested, washed and incubated for
10 minutes in the dark and at RT with anti-CD19 APC
(Invitrogen). Then, cells were washed and 100μl of
binding buffer plus 5μl of Annexin V-FITC were added
for further 10 minutes in the dark and at RT. After the
incubation, 100μl of binding buffer were added and
cells were analyzed by flow cytometer FACSCalibur. At
least 20,000 events were collected using CellQuestPRO
software.

Culture conditions
Purified leukemic and normal B cells (2x106/ml)
and MSCs (1x105/well seeded into 12 well plates) were
cultured in complete RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich)
at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.
For co-culture experiments, neoplastic and normal B
cells were added to MSC layer at 20:1 ratio in complete
RPMI-1640 medium. The plates were incubated at 37°C,
in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and B
lymphocytes were harvested after 3, 5 and 7 days. In some
experiments, B cells obtained from 10 CLL patients before
and after therapy according to the protocol FLU-Cy: FLU
25 mg/m2 for 3 days and Cy 350 mg/m2 for 3 days, every
28 days; this therapy is the standard of care for patients
needing a therapy. For in vitro treatment with FLU and Cy,
CLL B cells were incubated with 20µM FLU and 5mM Cy,
as previously described [48]. For experiments using kinase
inhibitors, CLL B cells were cultured in presence and
absence of MSCs, as previously described, adding 5µM
Bafetinib (Selleck Chemicals; Munich, Germany), 5µM
Ibrutinib (Selleck Chemicals), and/or goat F(ab’)2 antihuman IgM (10µg/ml) (Southern Biotech; Birmingham,
USA). The concentration of inhibitors is chosen according
to preliminary experiments with different doses. In some
experiments, we also employed the HS-5 cell line, a
human fibroblastoid cell line available from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA), which
represent a component of the marrow microenvironment
[49]. To achieve complete confluence and the formation of
a stable feeder monolayer, 1x105 HS-5 cells were plated
in 12 well plates and irradiated at 4,000 Rad x 15 minutes
at least 48-72 hours before the addition of leukemic B
cells. Transwell (TW) experiments, using polycarbonate
membranes (Corning Costar; Cambridge, UK) with 0.4µm
pores, were performed to prevent physical contact between
B lymphocytes and MSCs, allowing the diffusion of
soluble factors secreted by the adherent layers of stromal
cells.

Multiplex cytokine analysis
In order to quantify chemokines and cytokines
released in culture supernatants, cell-free culture media
of previous experiments were collected after 7 days for
the human Bio-Plex™ 27 plex Cytokine Assay (Bio-Rad
Laboratories; Hercules, CA), which enables the detection
of Interleukin-1β (IL-1 β), IL-1ra, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6,
IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12 (p70), IL-13, IL-15, IL-17,
Basic FGF, CCL11, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFN-γ, CXCL10
(IP-10), CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL3 (MIP-1α), CCL4 (MIP1β), PDGF-BB, CCL5, TNF-α and VEGF. Measurements
were performed on Bio-Plex in duplicates. The Bio-Plex
Manager™ software shows data as Median Fluorescence
Intensity (MFI) as well as concentration (pg/ml). The
concentration of the analyte bound to each bead is
proportional to the MFI of reporter signals.

ELISA assay
The cell-free culture media of previous experiments
were collected after 7 days and analyzed for CXCL10 by
ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.

Western blotting
B cells (5x105 for each assay) were processed as
previously explained [48]. Samples were then subjected
to SDS/PAGE (10% gels), transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes and immunostained with primary antibodies
to: PARP (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.), Lyn (Santa
Cruz), Lyn-Tyr396 (Epitomics Onc.; Burlingame, CA),
ERK (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.), ERK-Thr202/
Tyr204 (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.), β-actin (SigmaAldrich), using an enhanced chemiluminescent detection
system (Pierce; Rockford, IL).

Cell viability testing
Freshly isolated CLL B and normal B cells were
cultured in direct or indirect (TW) contact with MSCs and
HS-5 at a ratio of 20:1. MSCs and HS-5 were cultured

medium. After incubation, CLL cells were added to the
MSC layers and the plates were incubated at 37°C in 5%
CO2 overnight. Cells that had not migrated into the stromal
cell layer were removed by vigorously washing 3 times
with RPMI 1640 medium. The complete removal of nonmigrated cells and the integrity of the stromal cell layer
containing transmigrated cells were assessed by phasecontrast microscopy and documented photographically.
The stromal cell layer containing transmigrated cells was
detached by incubation with Accutase (Sigma-Aldrich).
Cells were stained with anti-CD19 APC to exclude MSCs
and counted by flow cytometry.

Freshly isolated CLL B cells were cultured with
and without MSCs and treated with 5µM kinase inhibitors
as above described. Cells (5x105 for each assay) were
collected after 48h, leaving intact the adherent layer, and
stained with anti-CD49d PE (BD Biosciences), anti-CCR7
FITC (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA), antiCXCR4 PE (R&D Systems Inc.) anti-CXCR3 PE-Cy5.5
(BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), anti-CXCR5
FITC (R&D Systems Inc.), and anti-CD19 APC (BD
Biosciences) monoclonal antibodies. Cells were washed
with PBS1X and incubated with saturating concentrations
of the appropriate antibodies for 15 minutes at room
temperature. 20,000 total events were acquired using
FACSCanto A (Becton Dickinson) and the data were
analysed by FACSDiva 7 software. Samples were gated
on intact cells by forward scatter (FSC) vs side scatter
(SSC). For analysis, a second gating step on CD19+ cells
was used. Here, we used a difference between the Mean
Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) of fully-stained samples and
the Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) controls.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t
test, Fisher’s exact test and ANOVA test. Data are reported
as median ± standard deviation (SD) and a p-value of 0.05
or less was considered as significant.

To obtain the MSC-conditioned medium (MSCCM), MSCs were cultured for 48h in complete RPMI1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C in a humidified
atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The migration of
pretreated CLL B cells in response to MSC-CM was
evaluated using 12-well Corning chemotaxis chamber
(Corning Life Sciences; Acton, MA). Briefly, 2.5x106
cells were incubated in 0.5ml RPMI medium with and
without kinase inhibitors for 1h at 37°C. Then, cells were
transferred into the top chambers of transwell culture
insert with a pore size of 3µm. Filters were then placed
onto wells containing complete RPMI medium or MSCCM, and CLL B cells were allowed to migrate for 3h at
37°C. Migrated cells in the lower chamber were then
collected and counted on a FACSCanto A for 60 seconds
in triplicates.

CLL

Pseudoemperipolesis is an in vitro phenomenon in
which CLL cells spontaneously migrate beneath marrow
stromal cells to mimic the in vivo migration and homing
to stromal cells in the tissues [50]. Briefly, MSCs were
seeded onto 12-well plates in complete RPMI medium till
confluence. CLL B cells were suspended to a concentration
of 2x106 cells/ml in complete RPMI medium with or
without 5µM Bafetinib, CAL-101 and Ibrutinib and
incubated for 1h at 37°C in 5% CO2 in complete RPMI
