Abstract
DNA damage stabilizes the p53 tumor suppressor protein that
determines the cell fate by either cell cycle arrest or cell death
induction. Noxa, the BH3-only Bcl-2 family protein, was shown
to be a key player in p53-induced cell death through the mitochondrial dysfunction; however, the molecular mechanism
by which Noxa induces the mitochondrial dysfunction to
cause cell death in response to genotoxic agents is largely
unknown. Here, we show that the mitochondrial-targeting
domain (MTD) of Noxa is a prodeath domain. Peptide containing MTD causes massive necrosis in vitro through cytosolic
calcium increase; it is released from the mitochondria by
opening the mitochondrial permeability transition pore.
MTD peptide–induced cell death can be inhibited by calcium
chelator BAPTA-AM. Moreover, MTD peptide shows the potent
tumor-killing activities in mice by joining with tumor-homing
motifs. [Cancer Res 2009;69(21):8356–65]

Introduction
Apoptosis is a fine-tuned mechanism to eliminate harmful, seriously damaged, or unnecessary cells in multicellular organisms. Extensive lines of evidence indicate that the mitochondria act as
regulators of apoptosis, and mitochondrial integrity is controlled
by the Bcl-2 family proteins (1). Bcl-2 family members are divided
into two main groups according to whether they promote or inhibit apoptosis. The antiapoptotic members (e.g., Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL)
possess four BH domains from BH1 to BH4, whereas the proapoptotic members (e.g., Bax and Bak) have three BH domains
from BH1 to BH3. The BH3-only proteins (e.g., Bid, Noxa, and
PUMA) induce apoptosis by activating proapoptotic proteins such
as Bax and Bak or inhibiting antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2
and Mcl-1 (2, 3).

Mouse Noxa, originally identified as a p53 target gene, plays a
crucial role in apoptosis iduced by p53-dependent genotoxic stimuli (4–7). Two functional domains in Noxa, the BH3 domain and
the mitochondrial-targeting domain (MTD), have been identified
(8). Recent studies indicate that the Noxa BH3 domain is crucial
to the protein's ability to induce cell death by the selective inhibition of Mcl-1 and A1/Bfl-1 (1, 9–13). On the other hand, deletion of
the Noxa MTD completely abolished cell death in HeLa cells mainly due to the loss of Noxa mitochondrial localization (8). Thus, it
was thought that the MTD of Noxa delivers the BH3 domain of
Noxa to the mitochondria, where the BH3 domain binds to Mcl-1
and A1/Bfl-1, resulting in inactivation of antiapoptotic activities
of Mcl-1 and A1/Bfl-1. This hypothesis suggests that cell death–inducing activity of Noxa solely depends on the capability of Noxa
BH3 domain to inactivate Mcl-1 and A1/Bfl-1 function. However,
Noxa mutant carrying mutation in BH3 domain cannot completely
abolish the cell death–inducing activity of Noxa (6, 14), indicating
that there is another potential killing domain in Noxa.
Here, we provide the evidence that Noxa MTD is another killing
domain irrespective of BH3 domain, and show that MTD peptide
alone can induce the cell death by opening of mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT) pore and calcium release.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/mL of penicillin, and 100 μg/mL of
streptomycin at 37°C with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator.
Cloning and mutagenesis. Deletion constructs of Noxa were described
previously (8). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using PCR primers
to convert leucine residues at positions 29, 42, 43, 45, and 49 of Noxa to
alanine as follows. For L29A conversion, the first PCR was performed using
following the primers: Noxa 5′-(1)-primer (GAAGATCTATGCCTGGGAAG‐
AAGGCGCGC) plus L29A 3′-primer (CTCCAAATCTCCTGGCTTGAGTAGC‐
ACACTC) and L29A 5′-primer (GAGTGTGCTACTCAAGCCAGGAGATTTGGAG) plus Noxa 3′-(54)-primer (CGAATTCTCAGGTTCCTGAGCAGAAG‐
AG) and pEGFP-Noxa as a template, and then a second PCR was carried
out using the Noxa 5′ (1) primer plus Noxa 3′ (54) primer with the first PCR
products as a template. The second PCR products were digested with BglII
and EcoR1 and cloned into pEGFP-c1. For L42A, L43A, and L45A conversions, PCRs were carried out using Noxa 5′ (1) primer plus L42A 3′-primer
(TTTGGATATCAGATTCAGAGCTTTCTGCCGGAA), Noxa 5′-(1)-primer
plus L43A 3′-primer (TTTGGATATCAGATTCGCAAGTTTCTGCCGG), and

Noxa 5′-(1)-primer plus the L45A 3′-primer (TTTGGATATCGCATTCAGAAGTTTCTGCCGG), respectively, and the PCR products were then digested with BglII and EcoRV and cloned into pEGFP-Noxa (1-54)
digested with BglII and EcoRV. For L49A conversion, PCR was carried
out using Noxa 5′-(1)-primer plus L49A 3′-primer (CGAATTCTCAGGTTCCTGAGCAGAAGGCTTTGGATATCAGATTCAG), and then digested with BglII and EcoR1 followed by cloning it into pEGFP-c1 at
BglII and EcoR1 sites. For 4Lmt and 5Lmt, wild-type (WT) Noxa and
L29A constructs, respectively, were used as templates for PCRs done with
the Noxa 5′ primer plus the 4mt 3′-primer (GTTTGGATATCGCATTCGCAGCTTTCTGCCGGAAG). PCR products digested with BglII and EcoRV
were cloned into the vector generated from pEGFP-Noxa L49A. All Noxa
mutant constructs were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis.
Peptide synthesis. Peptides were synthesized and purified by high performance liquid chromatography to obtain peptides of 98% purity (Peptron). Peptides were suspended in 50% DMSO at 0.5 mmol/L and stored
at −20°C.
Measurement of intracellular calcium. For Ca2+ measurements in the
cytosol, HeLa cells were cultured in an Lab-Tek Chamber glass slide and
loaded with Fluo-4-AM at a final concentration of 3 μmol/L for 30 min,
followed by washing with PBS at pH 7.4 and the addition of fresh Ca2+-free
Krebs-ringer modified buffer [KRB: 125 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L KCl,
1 mmol/L Na3PO4, 1 mmol/L MgSO4, 5.5 mmol/L glucose, and 20 mmol/L
HEPES (pH 7.4), at 37°C] containing the indicated peptides. Time-lapse
images were obtained at 488-nm excitation with the Argon laser scanning
confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP5 Microsystems) at 10-s intervals for
5 min to visualize Fluo-4-AM.
Cobalt-quenched calcein assay. HeLa cells were loaded with 1 μmol/L
Calcein-AM and 2 mmol/L cobalt in serum-free DMEM for 15 min, followed
by adding 25 μmol/l MitoTracker for 2 min to stain the mitochondria.
Then, HeLa cells were briefly washed with HBSS and were treated with
MTD peptide in calcium-free media containing 10% FBS. Time-lapse
images were obtained at 10-s intervals for 10 min.
Cell death assay. The percentage of cell death was determined by
counting enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)–positive dead cells
with morphology using the fluorescent microscope. Minimally, 300 cells
in three separate fields were counted for each measurement.
Syngeneic animal tumor model. We followed the university's institutional guidelines and regulations for animal experiments. Tumors were established in BALB/c mice by s.c. injection of CT-26 cells (1.5 × 105 cells) into
the mouse as described (14). Tumor volume was calculated as length ×
width2 × 0.5. Tumor cells were grown for 7 to 8 d, and TU2:MTD peptide
(385 μg/mouse), TU3:MTD peptide (230 μg/mouse), or PBS was i.v. injected
through the tail vein every 2 d until the mice were sacrificed.

Results
MTD of Noxa has cell death-inducing activity. Previously, we
defined the COOH-terminal region (41-50) of Noxa as the MTD (8).
Because the BH3 domain of BH3-only proteins exerts its influence
on the mitochondria, we hypothesized that the BH3 domain could
be efficiently delivered to the mitochondria if fused with the MTD,
such that the chimeric peptide would have the more potent killing
activity. Peptides of the NoxaBH3 domain alone, NoxaMTD alone,
and the BH3 domain fused with the NoxaMTD were synthesized
(Supplementary Table S1; Fig. 1A), and were tested for their ability
to induce cell death, showing that the MTD alone had the comparable cell death–inducing activity to NoxaBH3MTD peptide
(Fig. 1B). It indicates that MTD in Noxa may have a killing activity.
Thus, we have checked the cell killing activities of Noxa deletion
mutants in HeLa cells (Fig. 1C). Overexpression of WT Noxa and
21-54, which contained both the BH3 domain and MTD, induced
cell death within 11 hours in HeLa cells. 41-54, which contained
only MTD, and 21-40, which contained only the BH3 domain, induced little cell death within 11 hours; also, 1-30, which did not

www.aacrjournals.org

contain any domains, had no effect on cell death in HeLa cells
(Fig. 1D). These results are consistent with the previous results
showing that both the BH3 domain and the MTD are required for
Noxa-induced cell death (8). However, with increasing time, strong
cell death–inducing activity was observed with the 41-54, indicating
that MTD alone has cell death–inducing activity. Overexpression of
the 21-40 resulted in strong cell death–inducing activity at 24 and
36 hours (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that both the BH3 domain
and the MTD of Noxa possess the cell killing activities.
The characteristics of cell death induced by MTD peptide were
quite different from the classic apoptotic characteristics. Unlike
the membrane shrinkage of apoptotic cells induced by TRAIL, bubble-like structures of dying cells treated with MTD peptide were
observed (Fig. 2A). MTD peptide–treated cells were stained with
Annexin V and SYTOX Green (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B),
and showed the swollen cytoplasmic membrane, a typical morphology of necrosis. Also, ultrastructural changes analyzed by
transmission electron microscopy revealed the swollen mitochondria, the enlarged nucleus, and cell membrane swelling by MTD
peptide, indicating that MTD peptide induces necrosis rather than
apoptosis (Fig. 2A). Because high mobility group B1 (HMGB1) can
be released to outside of cells undergoing necrosis (15, 16), HMGB1
should be released into the media when HeLa cells are treated with
MTD peptide. Indeed, HMGB1 was significantly released to the media within 10 to 30 minutes after MTD peptide treatment, whereas
HMGB1 was retained in cells without MTD peptide treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S1C).
We further tested whether MTD peptide directly damages the
mitochondria. Cytochrome c was not released from the mitochondria to the cytosol in cells treated with MTD peptide, whereas Noxa WT was able to release the cytochrome c from
mitochondria (Fig. 2B). Also, MTD peptide–induced cell death
could not be blocked by the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk
or IDN-6556 (Fig. 2C), supporting the view that MTD peptide–
induced cell death is mediated by a noncaspase process. The isolated mitochondria treated with MTD peptide and the mutant
MTDmt5 peptide [mutant peptide, no killing activity (Fig. 3A)]
did not show any morphologic changes or mitochondrial size
changes (Supplementary Fig. S1D). Moreover, R8 or ΔR8:MTD
could not cause cell death (Fig. 2C), suggesting that MTD peptide
needs to pass through the cytoplasmic membrane and then activates some cytosolic factor(s) to initiate the cell death. Caspases
were not activated by the MTD, the mutant MTDmt4 [mutant
peptide maintaining the killing activity (Fig. 3A)], or MTDmt5
peptides (Supplementary Fig. S1E). It is further confirmed by
the facts that cell death induced by Noxa 41-54 transfection into
HeLa cells was not inhibited by zVAD-fmk, whereas cell death induced by Noxa WT transfection was significantly inhibited by
zVAD-fmk (Supplementary Fig. S4). Together, these results support the view that Noxa MTD induces the necrotic-like cell death
in a caspase-independent manner.
Leucine residues in the MTD are critical to cell death–
inducing activity. To determine the critical amino acid(s) in MTD
responsible for the cell death, we introduced scanning mutations
(Supplementary Table S1) in MTD peptide. MTDmt1 and MTDmt2
peptides exhibited similar cell death–inducing activities in HeLa
cells. MTDmt3 and MTDmt5 peptides completely lost their cell
death–inducing activities (Fig. 3A). MTDmt3 and MTDmt5 peptides commonly contain leucine residues, suggesting that leucine
residues in the MTD may play a crucial role in the cell death–
inducing activity.

microscope.

To determine which of the leucine residues in the MTD are critical for its function, a 4Lmt Noxa mutant was generated to contain
four substitution mutations (L42A, L43A, L45A, and L49A) at the
four leucine residues in the MTD. Also, a 5Lmt Noxa mutant was
generated that contained the same mutations in the MTD as 4Lmt
and an additional mutation (L29A) in the BH3 domain, because the
leucine residue in the Noxa BH3 domain was shown to be critical
for its killing activity (6). Although WT Noxa induced >60% of cell

death, 4Lmt and 5Lmt almost completely lost all of the cell death–
inducing activity. The loss of cell death–inducing activity in 4Lmt
and 5Lmt was mainly due to the loss of Noxa mitochondrial localization (Supplementary Fig. S2A and B). To further determine the
critical residues in the MTD, we constructed single amino acid
substitution (leucine residue to alanine residue) in either the
MTD (L42A, L43A, L45A, and L49A) or in the BH3 domain
(L29A), or triple substitution (3Lmt) in both MTD (L45A and

L49A) and BH3 domain (L29A) and assessed the effect on the cell
death–inducing activity. First, we tested Noxa mitochondrial localization in these mutants. The Noxa point mutants (L42A, L43A,
L45A, and L49A) maintained the typical mitochondrial localization of Noxa based on confocal microscopic image analysis (data
not shown). Noxa L29A, L45A, L49A, and 3Lmt mutants had remarkably reduced the cell death–inducing activities (Fig. 3B),
indicating that both 45 and 49 leucine residues in the MTD

and 29 leucine in the BH3 domain play a key role in the
Noxa-induced cell death.
Mcl-1 has been known to inhibit Noxa-induced cell death by
binding to BH3 domain of Noxa (12, 17, 18). To test whether the
point mutations in MTD region of Noxa affects the binding of Noxa
to Mcl-1, the interactions between Mcl-1 and Noxa mutants were
examined by immunoprecipitation. Noxa mutants in the MTD
region maintained their binding abilities to Mcl-1, indicating that

for 5 m. Relative fluorescence intensities at two region-of-interests (ROI 1 and 2) were measured at 5-s intervals for 5 min.

the reduced killing activities of L45A and L49A were not due to the
loss of Mcl-1 binding activity (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
To determine the susceptibilities to MTD peptide in different
types of cells, HeLa cells, NCI-H460, or A549 were treated with
0.5 to 5 μmol/L MTD peptide. HeLa cells showed the minimal susceptibility to 5 μmol/L MTD peptide (Supplementary Fig. S2D);
however, NCI-H460 cells were very susceptible to 5 μmol/L MTD
peptide but not to 5 μmol/L MTDmt3 or MTDmt5 peptides
(Fig. 3C). A549 seems to be very resistant to 5 μmol/L MTD peptide
(Fig. 3D). These results show that different types of cells show the
differential susceptibilities to MTD peptide.
Cytosolic calcium increase by MTD peptide is associated
with the opening of mPT pore. Calcium has been known as a
regulator of both cell survival and cell death depending on various
cellular signals (19, 20). Thus, we tested whether MTD peptide

www.aacrjournals.org

changes the calcium concentration in the cytosol. The cytosolic
calcium changes were monitored using Fluo-4-AM, a fluorescent
calcium indicator, in HeLa cells. Cytosolic calcium was substantially increased within 1 to 3 minutes after MTD peptide treatment,
and subsequent decay was observed; however, treatment of HeLa
cells with MTDmt3 and MTDmt5 peptides did not induce changes
in the cytosolic calcium level (Fig. 4A). This suggests that the
cytosolic calcium spike is a key event in MTD peptide–induced cell
death. If this increase of cytosolic calcium is the major cause of
MTD peptide–induced cell death, the calcium-selective chelator
BAPTA-AM should inhibit MTD peptide–induced cell death. As
predicted, pretreatment of HeLa cells with BAPTA-AM inhibited
MTD peptide–induced cell death (Fig. 4B), supporting the idea that
the cytosolic calcium spike is a key event in MTD peptide–induced
cell death.

Figure 5. The opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore by MTD peptide. A, HeLa cells were loaded with 1 μmol/L Calcein-AM and 2 mmol/L cobalt for
15 min, and the mitochondria were stained by adding 25 μmol/L MitoTracker for 2 min. The representative image of the calcein signals (green) that were overlapped
with MitoTracker (red) was shown. B, time-lapse images of calcein and MitoTracker signals from HeLa cells that were not treated (top) or treated (bottom) with
MTD peptide were obtained at 10-s intervals for 5 min. The representative images at the indicated time points were shown.

Because the MTD of Noxa is responsible for targeting to the mitochondria, and MTD peptide induces the cytosolic calcium spike,
we can expect that the cytosolic calcium spike observed during
MTD peptide–induced cell death is caused by opening of the
mPT pore. However, it is equally possible that the cytosolic calcium increase by MTD peptide is due to the release of calcium from
the endoplasmic reticulum through IP3 receptor and ryanodine receptor or the import of calcium from the outside of cells (21). To
investigate these possibilities, cytosolic calcium changes by MTD
peptide were examined in calcium-free KRB media, in the pres-

ence of 2-Aminoethoxy-diphenylborate and Ryanodine to block
IP3 receptor and ryanodine receptor, respectively, or in the presence of cyclosporine A (CsA) to block mPT pore in HeLa cells by
time-lapse video confocal microscopy (Fig. 4C). The cytosolic calcium spike was observed in the calcium-free KRB media and in the
presence of 2-Aminoethoxy-diphenylborate and Ryanodine under
the KRB media, indicating that the cytosolic calcium spike by
MTD peptide is not due to the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum or the import of calcium from the outside of cells.
However, cytosolic calcium spike was not observed in the presence

of CsA (Fig. 4C), supporting the idea that the cytosolic calcium spike
by MTD peptide is caused by a calcium leak from the mitochondria.
Because CsA is a well-established blocker of mPT pore, the permeability of the mPT pore was directly monitored using cobaltquenched calcein assay. Nonfluorescent membrane permeable
calcein-AM and cobalt were added into HeLa cells, and membrane
nonpermeable calcein can be spontaneously generated by nonspecific esterases in the cytosol and in the mitochondria. The cytosolic
calcein signal can be quenched by cobalt, but mitochondrial calcein
signal cannot be quenched because cobalt cannot penetrate the mitochondrial membrane. The mitochondrial calcein signal (green)
was overlapped with the mitochondria specific dye MitoTracker
(red), confirming that cobalt quenched the cytosolic calcein signal
but not the mitochondrial calcein signal (Fig. 5A). When the mPT
pore opens, cobalt is allowed to enter to the mitochondria through
the mPT pore and then quenches the mitochondrial calcein signal.
In HeLa cells that were not treated with MTD peptide, the mitochondrial calcein signals were sustained for 5 minutes and were also overlapped with the MitoTracker staining, indicating that the
mPT pore is closed (Fig. 5B, top). However, in HeLa cells that were
treated with MTD peptide, the mitochondrial calcein signals were
significantly decreased within 5 minutes after the treatment of
MTD peptide, indicating that the mPT pore is opened by MTD peptide (Fig. 5B, bottom). Taken together, these results indicate that
MTD peptide opens the mPT pore that allows the mitochondrial
calcium to be released into the cytosol.
Tumor-homing MTD peptides suppress tumor growth.
Because MTD peptides bear the eight arginine residues that can
penetrate the cytoplasmic membrane of any types of cells, they
must be very toxic to animals if systemically injected. Thus, to
develop MTD peptide as a tumor-killing agent, it should be redesigned as to selectively deliver it to tumor cells or tumor blood
vessels. Three tumor-homing MTD (TU:MTD) peptides that bear
the tumor vasculature–targeting motifs were synthesized (Supplementary Table S1; refs. 22, 23), and they were tested for the tumor
cell killing activities using CT26 mouse colon carcinoma cells. TU2:
MTD and TU3:MTD peptides showed the comparable killing activities to MTD peptide in CT26 cells; however, TU1:MTD peptide did
show no or little killing activity, indicating that TU2:MTD and TU3:
MTD peptide can penetrate the cytoplasmic membrane of CT26
cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A). To test whether these peptides have
effects on tumor killing or tumor growth in animal, TU2:MTD or
TU3:MTD peptides were i.v. injected into BALB/c mice bearing
tumors developed by s.c. injection of CT26 cells. The mice treated
with TU2:MTD or TU3:MTD peptides had significantly smaller
tumors than did the mice treated with PBS (Fig. 6A and B). Histochemical examination of tumors revealed that massive cell death of
tumor cells was observed in mice i.v. injected with TU2:MTD or
TU3:MTD peptides; however, no cell death of tumor cells was
observed in mice injected with PBS (Fig. 6C). Dermis and epidermis
regions of PBS-injected mice, TU2:MTD peptide–injected mice, or
TU3:MTD peptide–injected mice showed similar structures, having
no or little cell death in these regions; also, microscopic analysis
showed no damages in liver and kidney tissues obtained from the
mice injected with TU2:MTD or TU3:MTD peptide, and these
peptide-injected mice showed no body weight loss (Supplementary
Figs. S3B-D and S6D), indicating that TU2:MTD and TU3:MTD peptides do not show apparent toxic effects in mice. Together, these
results indicate that TU2:MTD and TU3:MTD peptides selectively
target to the tumor regions and induce massive cell death of tumor
cells but not normal cells.

Discussion
In summary, we have shown that MTD in the BH3-only protein
Noxa per se is a prodeath domain irrespective of BH3 domain
through calcium mobilization by activation of mPT pore. We also
defined the critical amino acid residues (L45, L49) in the MTD of
Noxa for induction of cell death, and further showed that the MTD
peptide could be developed as a cancer-treating drug by fusing
with the tumor delivery domains.
Apoptosis shows cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and
generation of apoptotic bodies, whereas necrosis is characterized
by cellular swelling, organelle lysis, and cytoplasmic membrane
rupture. Although these two modes of cell death are apparently
unique and unlikely to be connected, recent studies suggested that
these two modes of cell death can be switched each other by the
environmental conditions and death stimuli (24–29). With this
perspective, it is of interesting to see domains of Noxa in a way
that BH3 domain is a key player for apoptosis, and MTD is a key
player for necrosis. This view can be supported by the facts that
introduction of mutation in BH3 domain of Noxa reduced the apoptosis induced by Etoposide, Adriamycin, or double-stranded
RNA plus Actinomycin (6, 30). On the other hand, in this study,
we showed that the peptides containing the MTD of Noxa induce
the necrosis (Fig. 2), suggesting that the MTD of Noxa contributes
to the necrosis. This view can be further supported by the observation that whereas the membrane blebbings, a key characteristic
of apoptosis, in HeLa cells transfected with Noxa 21-40 were observed, the bubble-like structures, a typical cytoplasmic membrane structure of necrosis, in HeLa cells transfected with Noxa
41-54 were observed (data not shown). In addition, the facts that
Noxa 41-54–transfected cells in HeLa cells (8) and MTD peptide
(Fig. 2B) showed neither cytochrome c release nor caspase-3 activation indicate that the mechanisms for MTD peptide–induced
cell death might be similar to that for Noxa MTD–induced cell
death.
Questions on the specificity of MTD peptide–induced cell death
can be raised by the hydrophobicity of MTD, postulating that it
may directly damage the membrane structures by breaking down
the lipid bilayer. However, we believe that MTD peptide induces
the specific cell death for following reasons. The peptides that
cause nonspecific membrane damages directly disrupt the membrane structure by itself. However, ΔR8:MTD (Fig. 3D) shows no
cell death–inducing activity, indicating that MTD peptide without
PTD does not damage the cell membrane. Moreover, the facts that
isolated mitochondria showed no morphologic changes by MTD
peptide, and the mitochondria in Jurkat cells treated with MTD
peptide showed the swollen mitochondria (Fig. 2A) indicate that
MTD peptide does not simply disrupt the membrane structure itself and may need a cytosolic factor for its cell death–inducing activity. This speculation can be further supported by the facts that
mutant MTD peptides including MTDmt3 and MTDmt5 induce no
cell death in HeLa cells (Fig. 3A). The differential susceptibilities of
different cell lines to MTD peptide are another indication on the
specificity of MTD peptide–induced cell death (Fig. 3). Together,
these data indicate that MTD peptide does not cause the nonspecific membrane damage or disruption, and MTD peptide needs
some cytosolic factor(s) to kill the cells.
