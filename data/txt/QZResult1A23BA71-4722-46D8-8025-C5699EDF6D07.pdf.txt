ABSTRACT
Objective: To develop an accurate model with pre-treatment parameters to
predict tumor regression and down-staging in locally advanced rectal cancer patients,
basing the cohort of preoperative chemotherapy alone in FOWARC study.
Patients and Methods: From Jan 2011 to Feb 2015, complete data was available
for 137 out of 165 patients who received preoperative chemotherapy alone. All pretreatment clinical parameters were collected. Tumor regression grade (TRG) 0-1 was
defined as good regression, and pathological TNM stage (ypTNM) 0-I after neoadjuvant
treatment was defined as good down-staging. Nomogram was established to predict
tumor regression and down-staging. The predictive performance of the model was
assessed with concordance index and calibration plots.
Results: Of the 137 patients, 10 had TRG 0 (complete regression); 32 patients,
TRG 1; and 95 patients, TRG 2 and 3 (poor regression); 56 (40.9%) patients were
classified as good down-staging with ypTNM stage 0-I. The predictive nomograms
were developed to predict the probability of TRG 0-1 and good down-staging with a
C-index of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.604-0.797) and 0.76 (95% CI: 0.681-0.844). Calibration
plots showed good statistical performance on internal validation. Predictive factors
in the models included tumor length, tumor circumferential extent, age, and ApoA1.
Conclusions: The model based on available clinical parameters could accurately
predict early efficacy with neoadjuvant mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy alone, which might
help in patient selection for optimized treatment.

INTRODUCTION

Oncology/Radiation Oncology/Medical Oncology of the
German Cancer Society) study in 2004 [5], preoperative
chemoradiotherapy (CRT) with infusional fluorouracil and
TME surgery became the standard-of-care for patients
with stage II-III rectal cancer. The incidence of local
recurrence at 5 and 10 years in preoperative CRT group
was 5% and 7.1%, respectively, while in postoperative
CRT group, the incidence was 9.7% and 10.1% [6].
However, about 30% of patients still developed distant
metastasis after long-term follow-up, which remains the

In the past few decades, treatment outcomes for
rectal cancer have shown tremendous improvement.
Adoption of better surgical techniques and total
mesorectal excision (TME) are cornerstones of the
therapy [1, 2]. The introduction of neoadjuvant treatment
in locally advanced rectal cancer further decreased the
risk of local-regional recurrence [3, 4]. After publication

main obstacle for improving survival. The survival of
patients with LARC is still as low as 65% [6]. Hence more
effective systemic treatment options are needed.
On the other hand, with the modern TME-based
surgical techniques, the local recurrence rate is under
control [7]. In the CAO/ARO/AIO-94 study, only about
3% of patients benefited from preoperative CRT [6].
Besides, preoperative radiation led to anal and sexual
functional concerns with no survival benefit [8]. The
major challenge that needs to be addressed immediately
is that rectal cancer patients do not undergo selective
preoperative radiotherapy.
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy-alone approach has been
proposed [9]. A prospective pilot study by investigators
of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center evaluated
neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone, with six cycles of
FOLFOX plus bevacizumab in locally advanced rectal
cancer patients. Thirty-two patients were enrolled with the
pathological complete response (pCR) rate of 25% [10].
The promising results suggested that in the era of TME
and high-quality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
radiotherapy might be omitted in selected patients.
To avoid the damage of radiotherapy for rectal
cancer patients, we designed a phase II study comparing
neoadjuvant FOLFOX6 chemotherapy with or without
radiation in locally advanced rectal cancer. The
preliminary results were reported in ASCO annual meeting
2015 [11]. In the group of patients with neoadjuvant
mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy alone, about 40% of patients
showed good down-staging, and radiation therapy should
be avoided in these chemo-sensitive patients.
In the past, many studies tried to find biomarkers to
predict prognosis of rectal cancer after preoperative CRT,
such as epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) and
thymidylate synthase (TS) genes, and carcinoembryonic
antigen [12-15]. However, most of them have not been
used in routine clinical practice. Some other studies have
established a nomogram predictive model with sequential
PET-CT imaging for rectal cancer in patients receiving
preoperative CRT, which is expensive and was also not
regularly recommended in the management of rectal
cancer [16, 17]. Until now, no predictive model has been
developed for preoperative chemotherapy alone in locally
advanced rectal cancer.
In this prospective study, we aimed to develop
an accurate model and nomogram with available pretreatment parameters to predict efficacy of locally
advanced rectal cancer with mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy
alone.

Patients
From Jan 2011 to Feb 2015, a total of 165 patients
were enrolled into the group receiving preoperative
mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy alone, among which, complete
information was available in 137 patients. All patients
were >18 years with histopathologically confirmed
rectal cancer with an inferior margin no more than 12 cm
above the anal verge assessed by MRI or CT with rectal
ultrasound. The clinical stage was cT 3/4 or lymph node
involvement (cN+) without distant metastasis as assessed
by MRI or multislice CT. MRI was recommended for
local staging. All patients were treated according to the
protocol (NCT01211210) with 4 cycles of mFOLFOX6
chemotherapy alone before surgery and then underwent
TME resection.
All the available pre-treatment clinical parameters
were collected, including gender, age, clinical TNM
stage, tumor length, tumor circumferential extent, and
distance from the tumor inferior margin to the anal verge.
The blood biomarkers including blood routine test (white
blood cell count [WBC], hemoglobin, lymphocyte,
neutrophil, and monocyte), blood biochemistry (lactate
dehydrogenase [LDH], alanine transaminase [ALT],
aspartate aminotransferase [AST], total bilirubin, direct
bilirubin, serum creatinine, cholesterol, high-density
lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, triglyceride,
apolipoprotein A-1 [ApoA1], and apolipoprotein B) and
serum tumor markers (carcinoembryonic antigen and
carbohydrate antigen 19-9) were also analyzed.

Pathological assessment
All resection specimens were assessed by two
pathologists blinded to clinical outcomes of the patients,
according to American Joint Committee on Cancer
(AJCC) TNM staging category (y prefix indicated
classification after neoadjuvant treatment). Tumor stage
grouping, numbers of examined and involved lymph nodes
were recorded.
Pathologic tumor regression grade (TRG) was
assessed semi-quantitatively by determining the amount
of viable tumor versus fibrotic tissue according to the
College of American Pathologists’ guidelines [18]. Tumor
response was graded on a scale of 0 (complete response;
no viable cancer cells) to 3 (poor response; minimal or
no regression, extensive residual cancer), wherein grade 1
referred to moderate response or minimal residual cancer,
and grade 2 indicated minimal response. In this study,
TRG 0-1 was defined as good regression, while tumor
down-staging to ypT0-2N0M0 was defined as good downstaging.

Calibration and internal validation of the
nomogram

Statistical analysis

The nomogram was validated internally with
1000 bootstrap resamples. The model performance for
predicting outcome was evaluated by calculating the
concordance index (C-index). The value of the C-index
ranges from 0.5 to 1.0, with 0.5 indicating a random
chance and 1.0 indicating a perfect ability to correctly
discriminate the outcome with the model. Calibration of
the nomogram for TRG and down-staging were performed
by comparing the predicted survival with the observed
survival after bias correction.

Binary logistic regression was used to analyze
the effect of all parameters on TRG and down-staging.
Variables that achieved significance at P < 0.05 were
entered into the multivariable analyses via the logistic
regression model. And the parameters that were significant
under clinical consideration were also incorporated into
the model. Statistical analyses to identify independent
prognostic factors were conducted in SPSS 16.0 for
Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL). On the basis of the results
of the multivariable analysis, a nomogram was formulated
to provide visualized probability prediction using R 2.13.1

achieved TRG 0 (complete regression), 32 patients
with TRG 1, and 95 patients with TRG 2 and 3 (poor
regression); 56 (40.9%) patients were classified as having
good down-staging with ypT0-2N0 (stage 0 and stage I).
No patients developed distant metastasis immediately after
neoadjuvant chemotherapy or surgery.

Clinicopathologic characteristics of patients
Of the 137 patients, the median age was 57 years
(range: 22 to 75 years). Most patients were men (70.8%
vs. 29.2%), and most were stage III at first diagnosis. Table
1 lists the clinicopathologic characteristics of all patients.
Among the collected variables, lactate dehydrogenase
was not considered for analysis due to the high rate of
missing values. Tumor length and the distance from the
anal verge were detected with MRI. Tumor length was the
distance from the inferior margin to the superior margin of
the tumor. The extent of tumor circumference was defined
as the quartiles of luminal circumference measured by
endoscope or MRI.
With pathological assessment, 10 patients had

Independent predictive factors in the study cohort
Univariate analysis was performed on all the
variables. Table 2 lists the results. Tumor length, tumor
circumferential extent, and ApoA1 were predictive factors
for good tumor regression (TRG 0-1) and good downstaging, whereas young age was only associated with
good down-staging. Surprisingly, clinical tumor stage and
clinical lymph node stage were not correlated with early
efficacy. Other parameters, including gender, distance
from anal verge, tumor marker (CEA, CA19-9), and blood

routine test were all not significantly different.
All significant parameters in the univariate analysis
were entered into the multivariable analysis based on the
logistic regression (Table 2). Only tumor circumferential
extent (P = 0.014) and ApoA1 (P = 0.038) were
independent predictors for TRG 0-1, while for good downstaging, only age (P = 0.02) and tumor circumferential
extent (P = 0.004) were independent predictors. Tumor
length has been reported earlier as an important predictor
for pCR when receiving preoperative chemo-radiation
[16]. Here we also selected tumor length into the model.
ApoA1 was also included due to significance near decision
boundary (P = 0.056).
Hence, the final selected predictors in the
multivariate model were age, tumor length, tumor
circumferential extent, and ApoA1.

demonstrated that tumor length and ApoA1 shared the
largest contribution to good regression, followed by
tumor circumferential extent. In predicting good downstaging, tumor circumferential extent showed the greatest
contribution, followed by tumor length, Age, and ApoA1.
Each of these variables was assigned a score on the point
scale. Through adding up of the score of each variable and
referring to the total point scale, we could draw a straight
line to determine the estimated probability of TRG 0-1
and ypT0-2N0.

Calibration of the nomogram
The calibration plots presented good statistical
performance upon internal validation between the
nomogram prediction and actual observation for
probability of TRG 0-1 (Figure 3) and good down-staging
(Figure 4). The Harrell’s concordance index (C-index) for
the established nomogram to predict tumor regression to
TRG 0-1 was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.604-0.797) and 0.762 (95%
CI: 0.681-0.844) for good down-staging.

Predictive nomograms established for early
efficacy
Nomograms that incorporated the selected predictive
factors were established (Figures 1 and 2). The nomogram

DISCUSSION

load. Tumor length has previously been reported to be
the most important predictor for pCR in rectal cancer
after neoadjuvant CRT [16]. In multivariate analysis,
tumor length was not a predictor.. Given clinical
consideration, we still integrated it into the model,
which increased the c-index of the predictive model. .
As for tumor circumferential extent, it has been proven
that circumferential extent of tumors less than 1/2 cycle
is associated with higher pCR rate [22]. Overall, tumor
dimension is one of the important predictive factors for
tumor regression and tumor down-staging.
Interestingly, ApoA1 showed predictive value in
the analysis. In fact, the relationship between ApoA1 and
tumorigenesis and development had been investigated
in the past few years. It has been reported that the serum
concentration of ApoA1 in breast cancer, colorectal
cancer, and pancreatic cancer was lower than that of
the control group, which was considered to be a serum
marker for detecting carcinoma [23-25]. In preclinical
study, ApoA1 has shown the potency of anti-angiogenesis
[26]. Besides, in breast cancer, the expression level of
ApoA1 increased in patients who showed good response
to preoperative chemotherapy, which demonstrated that
higher ApoA1 increased chemo-sensitivity [23, 27-29].
Here in the current study, we found that higher ApoA1
level was related to better response. Further investigations
are warranted on the detailed mechanism of ApoA1 in

Chemotherapy-alone approach showed promising
efficacy in the preliminary results of FOWARC study,
although it is not the standard-of-care for locally advanced
rectal cancer. [11]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first nomogram to predict the early efficacy of neoadjuvant
chemotherapy alone in locally advanced rectal cancer with
a prospective cohort. Previously, all the predictive models
were established basing on chemoradiotherapy [16, 17,
19].
As is known, pCR is the most robust surrogate
endpoint for early efficacy and long-term survival in
locally advanced rectal cancer [20]. However, in this
prospective cohort, pCR rate was only about 7%, which
is too low to build a model. Hence we measured the early
efficacy in two ways, TRG 0-1 (30.6%) and ypT0-2N0
(40.9%) in this study. In fact, the most frequently used
method to distinguish responders from non-responders
is by means of TRG [18]. Furthermore, it has been
demonstrated that TRG is the independent prognostic
factor for cumulative incidence of distant metastasis and
disease-free survival after CRT [21].
All the predictors in the nomogram were available
in routine pre-treatment examination, which was easily
to collect. Tumor length and tumor circumferential
extent were selected in the model, both referred to tumor

increasing the efficacy of chemotherapy.
Age is one of the predictor in tumor down-staging.
Young age was associated with better efficacy. Vincenzo,
et al. also built a nomogram for predicting overall survival
in rectal cancer. Age was also a positive predictor in the
model. [30] . Surprisingly, CEA was not a predictive
factor in our model. It has been reported that lower CEA
level was correlated with better efficacy and long-term
survival in rectal cancer after neoadjuvant CRT [12, 17,
31-34]. In our study, serum CEA level was lower than 5
ng/ml in most of the patients, with a median value of 2.38
ng/ml, which might contribute to the negative results.
All the parameters were collected before administering
any treatment. We only collected available clinical
parameters. More predictors could be added to increase
the performance of the model, including imaging variables
such as apparent diffusion coefficient or T2 mapping
of MRI [35-37] and biological variables such as gene
signatures [15].
The limitations of the study are as follows. First of
all, the samples size is relatively small. Second, external
validation was not performed due to lack of external
cohort, because neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone is still
not the standard care for locally advanced rectal cancer.
Prospective validation of the model is still required to
ensure sufficient statistical power for clinical application.
In conclusion, the novel nomogram for predicting
early efficacy of patients with locally advanced rectal
cancer after receiving neoadjuvant mFOLFOX6
chemotherapy alone might promote personalized treatment
approach in the future.
