Abstract

HHMI Author Manuscript

Most cancers arise from oncogenic changes in the genomes of somatic cells, and while the cells
may migrate by metastasis, they remain within that single individual. Natural transmission of
cancer cells from one individual to another has been observed in two distinctive cases in mammals
(Tasmanian devils1 and dogs2,3), but these are generally considered to be rare exceptions in nature.
The discovery of transmissible cancer in soft-shell clams (Mya arenaria)4 suggested that this
phenomenon might be more widespread. Here we analyzed disseminated neoplasia in mussels
(Mytilus trossulus), cockles (Cerastoderma edule), and golden carpet shell clams (Polititapes
aureus) and found that neoplasias in all three species are attributable to independent transmissible
cancer lineages. In mussels and cockles, the cancer lineages are derived from their respective host

species, but unexpectedly, cancer cells in P. aureus are all derived from Venerupis corrugata, a
different species living in the same geographic area. No cases of disseminated neoplasia have thus
far been found in V. corrugata from the same region. These findings show that transmission of
cancer cells in the marine environment is common in multiple species, that it has originated many
times, and that while most transmissible cancers were found spreading within the species of
origin, cross-species transmission of cancer cells can occur.
Disseminated neoplasia, or hemic neoplasia, a leukemia-like disease, occurs with high
prevalence in multiple bivalve species5,6. Here we investigated the possibility that cancers in
three species could be attributed to transmissible cancer cells, and whether these cancers are
restricted to the species of origin or can undergo cross-species transmission.

Mussels (Mytilus trossulus, Fig. 1a) are subject to disseminated neoplasia in the Pacific
Northwest Coast7,8, and evidence of common polymorphisms in neoplasias suggested that
these might represent a transmissible cancer9. 28 Mussels (M. trossulus) collected from
West Vancouver were screened for neoplasia by drawing hemolymph and analyzing
hemocytes for the rounded, non-adherent morphology of neoplastic cells. Two were
identified with high levels of neoplastic cells. We sequenced part of the mitochondrial
cytochrome c oxidase I (mtCOI) gene in host tissue and neoplastic hemocytes from the two
diseased animals and four normal animals to test whether the neoplastic cells were derived
from the host individuals or exhibited a distinct genotype, the hallmark of transmissible
neoplasia. While solid tissue and hemocyte genotypes within each normal animal were
always identical, solid tissue and neoplastic hemocyte genotypes of the diseased animals
were discordant (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 1). Moreover, the same single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) were found in neoplastic cells of the two diseased individuals,
indicating that the cancer cells were not of host origin and suggesting that they arose from a
single clonal origin. EF1α gene sequences also revealed that the genotypes of the host cells
and neoplastic hemocytes were discordant, and that the genotypes of the neoplastic cells of
the two different animals were again identical to each other (Fig. 1c).

HHMI Author Manuscript

To determine if this transmissible cell line was widespread in the M. trossulus population,
250 were collected from Vancouver Island, and seven potentially diseased individuals were
analyzed. In one neoplastic sample (MW81), the hemocyte and tissue genotypes did not
match, and the hemocytes contained the same mtCOI allele and the same EF1α major and
minor alleles found in the other samples (Fig. 1b, c, Extended Data Fig. 1). These genotypes
strongly indicate the existence of a M. trossulus-derived transmissible cancer lineage
circulating in the wild population.
High prevalence of disseminated neoplasia has been observed in two species of bivalves on
the Galician Coast, cockles (Cerastoderma edule)10,11 and golden carpet shell clams
(Polititapes aureus, previously named Venerupis aurea)12. The disease in cockles (C. edule)
exhibits one of two distinct morphologies, termed types A and B13,14. We collected about
150 cockles (C. edule), and examined the genotypes of solid tissue and hemocytes of six
normal individuals and six (Fig. 2a) with high (>75%) or moderate (15–75%) amounts of
neoplastic cells in the hemolymph. Nine polymorphic microsatellite loci15 were amplified
from normal animals, and allele sizes from tissue and hemocytes of each normal animal all

matched, but allele sizes in hemocytes and tissue of diseased animals were discordant (Fig.
2b, c). In a phylogenetic tree based on microsatellite alleles16,17 the neoplastic hemocyte
genotypes did not group with the host tissue genotypes, consistent with transmissible cancer,
and instead clustered into two distinct branches, suggesting two independent cancer lineages
(Fig. 2d). We sequenced the mtCOI gene and identified several SNPs that were present only
in lineage 2, and not in any of the normal animals. No unique SNPs were identified in the
mtCOI region sequenced in lineage 1.

HHMI Author Manuscript

The microsatellite alleles and mtCOI SNPs suggest two independent cancer lineages, but
these data are also consistent two subgroups which have diverged from a single transmissible
cancer lineage. To investigate this question, we sequenced an approximately 3 kb intronspanning region in EF1α from six normal individuals and two diseased individuals from
each lineage (Fig. 2e). Both neoplastic hemocyte alleles were different from the tissue
alleles in all diseased individuals, and the two alleles of the neoplasm in each diseased
individual were nearly identical to the two alleles of the other individual in the lineage.
However, both alleles in lineage 1 cells were different from those in lineage 2. Moreover, the
neoplastic alleles were more closely related to some normal alleles than they were to the
alleles of the alternate lineage. These data strongly suggest an independent origin of these
two lineages.
Histological and morphometric examination showed that all three samples in lineage 1 were
type A (characterized by a looser arrangement of neoplastic cells in the connective tissue,
with pleomorphic nuclei) and all three samples in lineage 2 were type B (tighter
arrangement, with smaller cells than type A and rounded, smaller nuclei, Fig. 2f–i, Extended
Data Table 1). Altogether, these results argue that two distinct lineages of transmissible
cancer, with distinct morphologies and genotypes, arose independently in cockles and are
circulating in this species.

HHMI Author Manuscript

We also examined golden carpet shell clams (P. aureus, Fig. 3a), which are present in the
same habitat as several other bivalves, including the closely related pullet shell clam
(Venerupis corrugata). Of 74 P. aureus individuals tested, nine had high levels of disease,
and 22 had low-to-medium disease. We sequenced regions of mtCOI, the ribosomal DNA
Internal Transcribed Spacer (rDNA ITS), and EF1α from tissue and hemocyte DNA of six
highly diseased and six normal P. aureus individuals, and again found that the genotypes of
neoplastic cells were nearly identical and did not match those of their hosts (Fig. 3b–d). In
contrast to the transmissible cancers in other species, however, the sequences of the
neoplastic cells were highly dissimilar from normal host sequence (only 78.4–78.5%
identical in the mtCOI locus and 89.3–93.2% identical at nuclear loci, ignoring insertions
and deletions). The neoplastic genotypes were instead near-perfect matches to the sequences
of V. corrugata (98.6–7% and 99.3–100% identical, respectively).
To confirm that detection of V. corrugata (Fig. 3e) sequence reflected the neoplastic cells
observed morphologically, we used species-specific EF1α qPCR to quantify the fraction of
cells that were derived from each species in the tissue and hemocyte samples (Fig. 3f). As
expected, no V. corrugata sequences were detected in normal P. aureus animals, but high
frequencies of V. corrugata DNA were detected in all six individuals diagnosed with high

levels of neoplasia and lower amounts in most individuals diagnosed with medium and low
levels. The small number of individuals diagnosed with low and medium disease in which V.
corrugata DNA was not detected could have primary host-derived neoplasia, a different
transmissible cancer lineage, too low an abundance of tumor DNA to detect, or even a small
amount of normal cells with an unusually rounded morphology. In diseased animals, the
highest levels of V. corrugata sequence were detected in hemocytes, and lower levels were
present in tissues, likely due to infiltration of cancer cells via the circulation. We conclude
that the cancer spreading in the P. aureus population resulted from cross-species
transmission of cancer cells of V. corrugata origin. It is noteworthy that no cases of
disseminated neoplasia have thus far been found in V. corrugata from the same region,
despite analysis of hundreds of clams, suggesting that the V. corrugata cancer cells do not
initiate disease in the species of origin and were only observed to colonize P. aureus animals.

We previously identified an LTR-retrotransposon, Steamer, which was amplified in the
transmissible neoplasia lineage in the soft-shell clam (M. arenaria)18. Using degenerate
primers we identified at least one Steamer-like element (SLE) in each of the three species
studied here. In each case, copy numbers were variable among individuals, but no massive
amplification of these particular retrotransposons was observed in any of the transmissible
cancers assayed (Extended Data Fig. 2). This suggests that Steamer-like retrotransposon
amplification is not essential in development of transmissible clones.
Our results indicate that transmission of contagious cancer cells is a widespread
phenomenon in the marine environment, with multiple independent lineages developing in
multiple species in four bivalve families. Along with the recent identification of a second
independent lineage of transmissible cancer in Tasmanian devils19, these findings confirm
that under suitable conditions, the development of transmissible cancer can occur multiple
times, and suggests that some species may be more susceptible to development of
transmissible neoplasia than others.

HHMI Author Manuscript

Spontaneous hemic neoplasia must occur at some frequency in order for transmissible
lineages to arise, but cases of transmissible cancer appear to outnumber spontaneous disease,
at least in the species investigated so far (i.e. all neoplastic cases tested in cockles, golden
carpet shell clams, and three of nine samples in mussels, in addition to all samples in the
previous report of soft-shell clams4).
Transmissible cancers appear largely restricted to the species of origin in nature. While
canine transmissible venereal tumor has been experimentally transplanted to coyotes20,
jackals21, and foxes22–24, no examples of natural transmission beyond dogs have been
reported25. Disseminated neoplasias of molluscs have only been transplanted to members of
the same species (soft-shell clams, mussels, and others5,6). Attempts to transfer M. arenaria
neoplasia through water exposure to both M. arenaria and M. trossulus only resulted in
transfer of disease to M. arenaria26, and injection of M. trossulus cancer cells into multiple
bivalve species only resulted in engraftment in M. trossulus27. Our finding that multiple
cancer lineages are most often found to spread within the original host species is consistent
with these previous experiments, and suggests that there may be species-specific restriction
factors that prevent engraftment into divergent hosts.

In this context, our observation of cross-species transmission, a cancer from one species
spreading through another, is particularly striking. They both belong to the Veneridae family
(some studies suggest that P. aureus should belong to the Venerupis genus28), and coexist in
the same beds. This close relationship may have aided the transmission. It is notable that
despite ongoing surveillance of the bivalves of the Galician coast since the 1990s, only one
V. corrugata has been identified as harboring disseminated neoplasia (personal
communication, Susana Darriba, at INTECMAR), while the prevalence of disease in P.
aureus is quite high12 (12% of the individuals collected for the current study had high levels
of neoplasia and 42% had some detectable level of disease). This would be explained if the
cancer originated in V. corrugata, led to selective loss of susceptible animals, and left the
current population of V. corrugata resistant to engraftment and disease. The spread of
transmissible cancers and the evolutionary pressure to defend against them may be a strong
and underappreciated selective force in evolution of multicellular organisms.

HHMI Author Manuscript

In summary, our findings show that transmission of cancers between individuals within a
species may be more common than previously assumed, and that transmission can even
occur between species. We now know of eight transmissible cancers in nature: one lineage in
dogs, two lineages in devils, and five lineages circulating in four species of molluscs,
including one example of cross-species transmission. Further studies may well reveal
additional examples. The recent report of a cancer composed of transformed tapeworm cells
in an immunocompromised AIDS patient29 highlights the possibility that transmissible
tumors could arise in humans. These transmissible cancers constitute a distinct class of
infectious agent and show the remarkable ability of tumors to acquire new phenotypes that
promote their own survival and propagation.

METHODS
Collection and Diagnosis of M. trossulus

HHMI Author Manuscript

Mussel (M. trossulus) specimens 5 to 6 cm long were collected from the intertidal zone at
low tide (noon) on April 18, 2015 at Copper Beach (N 49° 22′41″ W 123° 16′ 44″, West
Vancouver, B.C., Canada). They were transported to the laboratory in aerated seawater from
Copper Beach. In the laboratory, 0.5 – 1.0 mL hemolymph was removed from the posterior
adductor muscle. For each individual, one drop of hemolymph was placed on a poly-Llysine-coated slide and let sit for 10–15 min to allow the cells to spread and attach to the
slide. Thereafter, the slide was viewed under a Zeiss Axiostar light microscope at 40×
magnification. Normal (non-neoplastic) specimens were those with greater than 90% cells
with normal appearance, i.e. agranular or granular hemocytes with spread pseudopodia30.
Fully leukemic (diseased) specimens were those with prolific amounts (> 90%) of round,
non-adherent cells. Hemolymph was added to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and spun at 900 g for
3 min. After the supernatant was withdrawn, the cells were re-suspended in absolute ethanol
before shipping. Excised tissues (mantle, foot, and gills) were preserved in absolute ethanol
before shipping. Of 28 individuals collected from West Vancouver, two had high levels of
neoplastic disease.
A second set of M. trossulus samples were collected from Esquimalt, Vancouver Island,
B.C., Canada. Hemolymph was extracted and cell morphology was used for diagnosis as

250 individuals collected from Esquimalt, nine were scored as potentially moderately or
highly diseased, with seven samples available for analysis.

Collection and Diagnosis of C. edule and P. aureus

HHMI Author Manuscript

Cockles (C. edule) were collected from an intertidal bed named O Sarrido (42° 30′ N, 8° 49′
W) and golden carpet shell clams (P. aureus) and pullet shell clams (V. corrugata) were
collected from a subtidal bed named O Bohído (42 ° 32′ N, 8° 51′ W); both shellfish beds
are located in the ria of Arousa (Galicia, NW Spain). Once in the laboratory of CIMA, each
cockle and clam was notched through the shell margin close to the posterior adductor muscle
and hemolymph (as much as possible) was collected from the posterior adductor muscle
using a 2-ml syringe with a 21 gauge needle. A small quantity (ca. 100 μl) of hemolymph
was used to produce a cell monolayer onto a slide by cytocentrifugation (92 × g, 5 min,
4°C), which was fixed, stained with Hemacolor (Merck) kit and examined with light
microscopy for diagnosis of disseminated neoplasia; the remaining hemolymph was
preserved in absolute ethanol for molecular analysis. After hemolymph collection, molluscs
were shucked and a small piece of mantle (ca. 5 × 5 mm square) was removed and preserved
in absolute ethanol for molecular analysis; additionally, an approximately 5 mm thick
section of meat, containing gills, visceral mass, foot and mantle lobes, was fixed in
Davidson’s solution and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 5 μm thickness were stained with
Harris-hematoxylin and eosin31. Histological sections were examined under light
microscopy for histopathological analysis.
Morphometric analysis was conducted on histological sections of cockle (C. edule) samples.
Neoplastic cells (both A and B types) had a unique morphology, and were clearly
distinguished from normal cells, with much larger overall size, and much larger nucleus. The
longest diameters of the cell and the nucleus of at least 10 neoplastic cells for each
individual were measured by direct examination of histological sections with light
microscopy using a reticle. Two-tailed T-tests were used for comparisons of morphometric
data from different individuals and types.

HHMI Author Manuscript

Cockles (C. edule) and golden carpet shell clams (P. aureus) were ranked according to a
scale of disease severity based on hemolymph diagnosis: non-affected (N0, or N); low
severity (N1, or L), when individuals showed proportions of neoplastic cells lower than 15%
in the hemolymph cell monolayers; moderate severity (N2, or M), when the proportion
ranged from 15% to 75%; and high severity (N3, or H), when the proportion was higher than
75%32. 74 golden carpet shell clams (P. aureus) were collected with 12 diagnosed with light,
10 with moderate, and 9 with heavy neoplasia. About 150 cockles (C. edule) were collected
and a subset was analyzed for both disease and morphological type of neoplastic cells. Of
the 30 in this subset, two had type A neoplastic cells (one light and the other moderate) and
one had low levels of type B neoplastic cells. We have also collected and analyzed hundreds
of pullet clams (V. corrugata) from multiple beds throughout Galicia from 1988 to the
present time, including about 100 from the same bed in which the samples of P. aureus were
collected for this study (O Bohído). To this date, we have not observed any V. corrugata
samples with neoplastic disease. One V. corrugata individual from a different location has

different morphology than that observed in P. aureus neoplasia (personal communication,

DNA extraction
DNA was extracted from ethanol-fixed hemocytes using DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit
(Qiagen). DNA extraction of tissues used the same kit, but included an additional step in
order to reduce the amount of PCR-inhibiting polysaccharides. After tissue lysis, 63 μl of
buffer P3 was added to lysate and allowed to precipitate for 5 min. Lysate was spun 10
minutes at full speed at 4°C, and the resulting supernatant was mixed with ethanol and
added to the column, continuing with the standard protocol.

Primers and annealing temperatures used are listed in Extended Data Table 2. PfuUltra II
Fusion HS DNA Polymerase (Agilent) was used to amplify 10 ng of genomic DNA for 35
cycles. Extension was at 72°C for 15 sec for mtCOI for all bivalves33. For P. aureus, ITS was
amplified (using primers modified from34,35) with extension for 30 sec. Despite multiple
copies of ITS in genomic DNA, a single sequence was observed for each normal P. aureus
and V. corrugata, and a single pair of host/neoplasm sequences was observed in each
diseased individual. PCR for EF1α followed the same program, with extension for 20 sec in
mussels (M. trossulus) and clams (P. aureus and V. corrugata) and 1 min 30 sec in cockles
(C. edule). For amplification of Steamer-like elements, a degenerate primer pair was
designed to match conserved regions in reverse transcriptase and integrase of the LTRretrotransposon, Steamer, and 10 ng of DNA was amplified for 35 cycles, annealing at 55°C
for 20 sec and extending for 1 min at 72°C. PCR products were directly sequenced. When
multiple alleles could not be resolved by direct sequencing, PCR products were cloned using
the Zero Blunt TOPO Kit (Invitrogen), and at least 6 colonies were sequenced. Sequences
were aligned with Clustal W, with some manual adjustment. Primer-binding regions were
excluded from analysis and are not included in the sizes listed as sequenced. Maximum
likelihood phylogenetic trees were generated using PhyML 3.036, using the HKY85
substitution model, with 100 bootstrap replicates, treating gaps in the alignment as missing
data. Trees were visualized using FigTree v1.4, with addition of markers at the branch
termini. Each phylogenetic tree based on alignment of sequence at a single locus (Figure 1c,
2e, 3b–d) includes a scale bar which shows genetic distance (0–1) based on the frequency of
nucleotide divergence. All sequences are available in GenBank (accession numbers:
KX018521-KX018605).
Analysis of microsatellite loci from cockles (C. edule)
Microsatellites were amplified using primers for 12 loci, reported previously to be
polymorphic in cockle (C. edule) populations15. Of the 12 primer pairs, 9 pairs amplified
products in all cockle DNA samples, with 1–2 alleles observed in normal samples and 1–4
neoplastic alleles observed. These were used in all further analyses, with fluorescent
modifications on the 5′ end of the forward primers as listed (Extended Data Table 2). KOD
polymerase (Millipore) was used to prevent ambiguity of untemplated addition of A residues
by Taq polymerase. Products were run on an agarose gel for visualization. Allele sizes were

identified to single-base precision by fragment analysis using florescent primers (6-FAM,
PET, NED, and VIC) using a 3730xl Genetic Analyzer with the LIZ-500 size standard,
(Applied Biosystems, operated by Genewiz). Peaks were called using Peak Scanner 2.0
(Applied Biosystems), rounding sizes to whole bases, with some manual adjustment to keep
alleles of the same size together.

HHMI Author Manuscript

We used the R package Poppr16 to generate distance matrices and phylogenetic trees using
the Bruvo’s method with the infinite alleles model. The value of c (repeat size) was set to
0.00001 in order to calculate distances using the band sharing model, in which alleles are
either identical sizes (distance=0) or non-identical (distance=1). Each allele was coded as a
dominant marker17, with a single variable for each allele observed at each position (104 total
markers from 9 loci). For each allele (a single size at a single locus), a sample is observed to
be either present, absent, or the information is missing. For example, a sample with sizes
195 and 199 at locus A would be marked as “present” for marker “A-195” and “A-199,” but
“absent” for all other sizes at that locus (like “A-203” and “A-207”). This analysis method
ignores the uncertainty in the copy number of each locus in aneuploid cancer cells and
allows for ambiguity at particular alleles. In cases where the hemocyte and tissue genotypes
could be clearly differentiated, all alleles were analyzed (H1 and H3). In some cases (M1,
M2, M3, and H2), cancer-specific alleles could be detected in the hemocyte samples, but
represented less than 50% of the total hemocyte DNA, and the host tissue alleles obscured
one or two positions (depending on whether the normal genotype was homozygous or
heterozygous at that locus). In these cases, since the tissue allele obscured a potential
neoplastic allele, that size was coded as “missing” for the hemocyte genotype. The total
distance between any two samples is calculated as the average of the pairwise differences at
all allele sizes observed (104 pairwise comparisons if no data is missing). In pairwise
comparisons for each allele, two samples either have a distance of 0 (meaning that the
particular allele size is either present in both samples or absent in both samples) or a
distance of 1 (meaning that the particular allele size is present in one sample but absent in
the other). If data are missing for one or both then that specific comparison is dropped with
no contribution to the total distance between the two samples. The genetic distances
calculated are based on the alleles observed at the 9 loci, so the absolute value of the scale
itself is therefore dependent on the number of observed alleles that are included in the
analysis. Source Data for the generation of the phylogenetic tree lists all observed alleles
coded as present (1), absent (2), or missing (0) for each sample.

HHMI Author Manuscript

As an alternate analysis method, the data were analyzed using Bruvo’s method as polyploid
data with 9 loci, using only the individuals which could be confidently identified. In this
alternate analysis, the topology of the resulting tree was not different—all nodes with
bootstrap values above 50 were maintained. In this analysis, the genetic distance between the
representatives of lineage 1 (H3) and lineage 2 (H1) was 0.676, and the distances to the
closest normal sample were 0.595 (H3 to N5) and 0.648 (H1 to N1 and N2).

same region, with the 3′ end of both forward and reverse primers on sites which differ
between the two species (Extended Data Table 2). Standard curves for each primer set were
generated using two control plasmids (one containing the P. aureus EF1α fragment and P.
aureus SLE fragment and the other containing the fragments from V. corrugata). EF1α
fragments were amplified using conserved primers (Extended Data Table 2). Fragments
were cloned with the Zero Blunt TOPO Kit (Invitrogen), and plasmids were linearized with
NotI before qPCR. Standard curve samples (104 through 102 copies per reaction) and
experimental samples (2.5 ng per reaction) were done in triplicate. No amplification was
detected with the P. aureus primers on the V. corrugata plasmid or with the V. corrugata
primers on P. aureus plasmid (using up to 107 copies per reaction). The fraction of V.
corrugata in each sample was calculated as the copy number using V. corrugata-specific
primers divided by copy number of P. aureus-plus V. corrugata-specific amplification.

HHMI Author Manuscript

Quantification of Steamer-like elements in the three species was performed by the same
method, using primers in the RT-IN region of the retrotransposon (based on sequence
obtained through amplification using degenerate primers) and control primers amplifying a
region in EF1α. All primers used to amplify SLEs and EF1α from genomic DNA for
cloning into standards and primers used for qPCR are listed in Extended Data Table 2. For
each species, a single control plasmid containing both the EF1α and the SLE fragment was
used.

N2) and a different one (SLE-Vc) was cloned from neoplastic cells (clam H2). Both SLEs
could be found in both species, and qPCR analysis confirmed that SLE-Pa is more highly
amplified in P. aureus and has fewer copies in V. corrugata and in the neoplastic cells derived
from V. corrugata.

a, Representative M. trossulus, with ruler for scale. b, Sequencing of mtCOI (bases 99–759)
was conducted for both host solid tissue (T) and hemocytes (H) of normal (N=4) and
neoplastic mussels (N=3). Open boxes mark SNPs which differ from allele A. Filled boxes
mark discordance between neoplastic hemocyte and tissue genotypes. Sequences are
numbered using AY823625.1. c, Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on sequences
of an intron-containing region of EF1α, with bootstrap values over 50 shown and a scale bar
showing genetic distance. M. edulis (614 bp, EU684203.1), was used as an outgroup. In
normal animals, the sequences of tissue and hemocyte DNA were identical and are presented
together (T&H; black circles). For neoplastic animals, the tissue (T; open red circles) and
hemocyte (H; filled red circles) alleles differed. Letters a and b denote multiple alleles in
heterozygous individuals, and major and minor alleles from neoplastic alleles are marked.
