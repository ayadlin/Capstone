ABSTRACT
Recovery from DNA damage is critical for cell survival. The serious damage is
not able to be repaired during checkpoint and finally induces cell death to prevent
abnormal cell growth. In this study, we demonstrated that 8N-DNA contents are
accumulated via re-replication during prolonged recovery period containing serious
DNA damage in mitotic cells. During the incubation for recovery, a mitotic delay and
initiation of an abnormal interphase without cytokinesis were detected. Whereas a
failure of cytokinesis occurred in cells with no relation with p53/p21, re-replication is
an anomalous phenomenon in the mitotic DNA damage response in p53/p21 negative
cells. Cells with wild-type p53 are accumulated just prior to the initiation of DNA
replication through a G1 checkpoint after mitotic DNA damage, even though p53 does
not interrupt pre-RC assembly. Finally, these cells undergo cell death by apoptosis.
These data suggest that p53 activates G1 checkpoint in response to mitotic DNA
damage. Without p53, cells with mitotic DNA damage undergo re-replication leading
to accumulation of damage

INTRODUCTION

plenty of time to undergo effective DNA repair. When the
DNA damage cannot be repaired completely as a result
of receiving high doses of the damaging agent or due to
serious genetic defects, cells either progress to apoptotic
death or adapt themselves to the unfavorable conditions
and enter an oncogenic state [1, 5, 6]. p53 functions as
a guardian of the genome by inhibiting cell growth and
activating the apoptotic machinery that leads to cell death
and suppresses tumors [7-9]. In particular, p53 has an
essential role in the G1 checkpoint as part of the response
to DNA damage [10, 11]. Cells with mutated or deleted
p53 do not stop progressing through the cell cycle and
can bypass the p53 checkpoint [12, 13]. p53 is regulated
through phosphorylation on serine residues in a DNA
damage-inducible manner by ATM/ATR and Chk1/Chk2
[14-16]. Active p53 move into the nucleus and activate the
transcription of several downstream target genes including
p21, which inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)
[17]. The loss of p53 promotes tumorigenesis at a high
frequency, and it is the most common genetic abnormality
found in over half of all sporadic human cancers [18, 19].
In previous reports, we investigated the response to DNA
damage during mitosis. DNA damage during early mitosis

Genomic stability is necessary for the next
generation to inherit perfect genetic information, but
DNA damage can cause genomic instability by inducing
mutations within chromosomal DNA. Cells are equipped
with specific mechanisms, known as checkpoints, to
protect themselves against DNA damage. During the
checkpoint process, cells recognize DNA damage and
stop continuous cell division until damage recovery is
completed [1]. The first step of the DNA damage response
involves sensor proteins such as Rad9-Rad1-Hus1,
which immediately recognize the damage and recruit
many transducers and effectors to the damage site [2, 3].
ATM and ATR protein kinases recruited to the damage
site phosphorylate γ-H2AX as a biomarker for doublestrand DNA breaks [3] in addition to phosphorylating the
downstream transducers, Chk2 and Chk1 [4, 5]. Chk1 and
Chk2 have been found to down-regulate Cdc25 family
members, which are responsible for activating the cdk/
cyclin complex [2]. This protein network finally leads
to cell cycle arrest at the G1/S, intra-S, or G2/M phase
through a checkpoint mechanism, and the cells are allowed

induces the cell to skip over the entire late mitotic process
as well as cytokinesis, and instead enter a G1 phase with
4N-DNA contents in an ATM/Chk1-dependent manner
[20, 21]. After that, multiploidy with 8N-DNA content is
generated through re-replication [22]. In this report, we
investigate how p53 is involved in adaption to damage
resulting from a long-term response to mitotic DNA
damage and connect the mitotic DNA damage response to
the G1/S-checkpoint.

cancer cell lines including oral gingival carcinoma
(YD38), tongue carcinoma (KB), stomach carcinoma
(SNU216), osteosarcoma (U-2OS), and HeLa cells. The
cells were synchronized at the prometaphase through
treatment with nocodazole for 16 hours, and severe DNA
damage was induced through treatment with 50 µM
of doxorubicin for 1 hour. The mitotic cells with DNA
damage were continuously cultured for 48 hours or longer
after washing in fresh media to allow for DNA damage
recovery (Figure 1A). Although multiploidy with 8N-DNA
content were found in HeLa and YD38 cells within 24
hours of incubation (Figure 1B, a & b), this phenotype
was not detected in the KB and SNU216 cells with mitotic
DNA damage, even after 48 hours of damage recovery
(Figure 1B, c & d). In the case of the KB cells, the number
of dead cells increased during extended incubation (Figure
1B, 48h in c). Interestingly, the U-2OS cells seemed to
recover and to progress to the cell cycle, even with serious
DNA damage (Figure 1B, e). These results indicated that
various cells cope with severe DNA damage through
different responses, including becoming multiploid,
stopping growth, or recovering from damage.

RESULTS
Mitotic DNA damage response in various cancer
cells
We previously reported that mitotic HeLa cells
with DNA damage entered a G1 phase with 4N-DNA
contents [20, 21] without undergoing cytokinesis, and
that during damage recovery, cells with 8N-DNA contents
were accumulated [22]. To examine whether or not the
appearance of multiploidy is a common phenotype in
the long-term response to mitotic DNA damage, we
investigated the mitotic DNA damage response in various

damage response and induces apoptotic cell death
in prolonged recovery period

serine-15 (Figure 1C, lanes 2 & 4 in panels p-p53 in c-e).
To directly investigate the relationship between
the formation of multiploid cells and the activation of
p53 during the response to mitotic DNA damage, we
examined the mitotic DNA damage response in isogenic
p53+/+ and p53-/- HCT116 cells. Both p53+/+ and p53-/- cells
in the prometaphase were released into a G1 phase during
incubation without DNA damage (Figure 2A, a & c).
However, prometaphasic p53+/+ and p53-/- cells with DNA
damage accumulated in a 4N-DNA stage after incubation
for 24 hours (Figure 2A, 8 h & 24 h in b & d). During
extended incubation for 48 hours, the p53+/+ cells with
DNA damage were continuously arrested in a 4N-DNA
stage (Figure 2A, 48 h in b), and the p53-/- cells, also
with DNA damage, became multiploid with 48% of cells
accumulating with 8N-DNA contents (Figure 2A, 48 h in
d). During prolonged incubation for recovery, the protein
expression levels of p53 in the wild-type cells increased
(Figure 2B, lanes 5–8 in panel α-p53 in a). Furthermore,

To identify the cause for differences in the
appearance of multiploidy in various cell lines, we first
investigated whether or not p53 operated normally after
DNA damage. Although HeLa cells are known to contain a
wild-Type p53 gene, the expression of p53 is repressed by
the human papilloma virus E6 [23-25]. YD38 is a p53-null
cancer cell line [26], whereas KB and U-2OS had been
found to be p53-positive [26-28]. To ensure consistency
with these previous reports, we confirmed the absence of
p53 expression in the HeLa and YD38 cell lines (Figure
1C, panels p53 & p-p53 in a & b). As expected, we
confirmed p53 expression in KB, SNU216, and U-2OS
(Figure 1C, panels p53 in c-e), and the p53 was positively
regulated after DNA damage by phosphorylation on

the phosphorylation of p53 on serine-15, which is induced
by DNA damage and is essential for p53 activation, was
elevated in the p53+/+ cells (Figure 2B, lanes 5–8 in panel
α-p-p53 in a). As was expected, endogenous p53 were not
detected in p53-/- cells with mitotic DNA damage (Figure
2B, panels α-p53 & α-p-p53 in b).
When p53 was ectopically expressed in HeLa cells
belonging to a p53-/- cell line (Figure 3A & B, lanes 1-8
in panel α-FLAG), it was activated normally through
phosphorylation on serine-15 under DNA damage
conditions (Figure 3B, lanes 5–8 in panel α-p-p53 in
b). Both the control and the overexpressed cells with
mitotic DNA damage remained in a 4N-DNA stage after
incubation for 8 hours (Figure 3C, panels 6 h in b & d).
Although the DNA contents increased to 8N in the control
cells (Figure 3C, panels 24-48 h in b), the 8N-DNA stage
did not appear in cells with overexpressed p53 during

extended incubation (Figure 3C, panels 24-48 h in d).
Moreover, these cells accumulated in a sub-G0 phase
within 24 hours of recovery incubation.
To investigate the long-term response to mitotic
DNA damage, HeLa cells arrested in prometaphase were
treated with doxorubicin to induce DNA damage and
were released into fresh media for 48 hours to recover
from the damage. Active cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP
was weakly detected 48 hours after release (Figure 3D,
lane 6 in the upper & middle panels in a). Under this
condition, 43.3% of the cells were double-positive for PI
and annexin V, 34.7% were double-negative for PI and
annexin V, and 23.9% were annexin V-positive (Figure
3E, noc/dox in a). The data suggest that it was not until
the cells were incubated for 48 hours that more than 65%
became defective, and the percentage of apoptotic cells
were no more than 24% of the total. p53 was ectopically

expressed in the HeLa cells and the mitotic DNA damage
response of these cells was analyzed under the same
conditions. Active cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP was
clearly detected just after release (Figure 3D, lanes 4-6
in upper & middle panels in b). Moreover, only 16.3% of
the cells were double-positive for PI and annexin V, and
75.0 % of the cells were annexin V positive. As expected,
more than 90% of the p53 overexpressed cells with mitotic
DNA damage were defective (Figure 3E, noc/dox in b),
indicating that p53 induced apoptosis in mitotic cells with
severe DNA damage while inhibiting damage adaptation.
The GTSE-1 protein is known to be a negative
regulator of p53. With respect to the G1 checkpoint and
the recovery period, it is normally expressed during the
G2 and the S phase [29, 30], and suppresses apoptosis for
normal cell growth. Indeed, when mitotic cells without
DNA damage undertook normal cell division, GTSE1 was highly expressed during extended culture (Figure
4A, lanes 1–4 in upper panels in a & b). The level of
p53 decreased and was inactivated under this condition
(Figure 3B, lanes 1-4 in a). However, when p53+/+ cells
were incubated for 48 hours to recover from mitotic DNA
damage, p53 had been activated (Figure 2B, lanes 5-8 in
a) and GTSE-1 expression also remained at a high level
during incubation (Figure 4A, lanes 5–8 in upper panels
in a). Conversely, in the p53-/- cells, GTSE-1 decreased
dramatically during extended incubation (Figure 4A,
lanes 5–8 in upper panels in b). Moreover, GTSE-1 and

p53 were co-localized in a nuclear region during mitotic
DNA damage recovery for 24-48 hours (Figure 4B, a).
Conversely, GTSE-1 did not accumulate in the nucleus in
the absence of p53 within 24-48 hours after release (Figure
4B, b). These results suggest that p53 may be restrained by
GTSE-1 during early damage recovery within 8 hours, and
that cells attempt to recover during the checkpoint. When
cells were exposed to severe damage stress, the level of
GTSE-1 expression remained constant and p53 became
active. Eventually, the cells appear to abandon recovery
attempts and are removed through apoptosis. In the p53/cells, GTSE-1 expression was defunct and/or was not
localized in the nucleus. Therefore the cells ceased DNA
replication for damage adaptation.

p53 does not affect cytokinesis failure and pre-RC
assembly in mitotic DNA damage recovery
To investigate whether p53 is involved in cytokinesis
failure in the short-term response to mitotic DNA damage
[20-22], both p53-/- (Figure 5A, a & b) and p53+/+ cells
(Figure 5A, c & d) synchronized at prometaphase
were observed under a live cell imaging microscope.
Normally, in both cases, prometaphasic cells without
damage perform late mitotic events and divide into two
daughter cells within 1 hour of release, suggesting that cell
division occurs regardless of the presence of p53 (Figure

5A, a & c). The p53-negative cells with mitotic DNA
damage failed to perform cytokinesis even after 3 hours
of incubation in fresh medium (Figure 5A, b). Under the
same conditions, the p53-positive cells were found to have
the same phenotype as the p53-negative cells (Figure 5A,
d). These data suggest that the existence and activation of
p53 does not affect cytokinesis failure or the induction of
4N-DNA G1 phase during short-term recovery.
To initiate replication of the eukaryotic genome,
pre-RC (pre-replicative complex) assembly is an essential
event, which begins in late mitosis and continues to the
G1 phase. The origin recognition complex (ORC) is a
sequence-specific DNA binding protein complex and is
recognized as the primary origin for pre-RC assembly.
Cdt1 and Cdc6 are localized on ORC to promote the firing

of the origin [31, 32]. To determine whether or not pre-RC
assembly preceded the re-replication following cytokinesis
failure in the mitotic DNA damage response, and whether
or not this assembly occurred in both p53+/+ and p53-/cells, the localization of Cdt1was detected in cells using
confocal microscopy (Figure 5B). In p53-/- cells, Cdt1
was localized in the nucleus during incubation after
nocodazole arrest and slowly diffused into the cytoplasm
after release for 12 hours (Figure 5B, Cdt1 in a). Although
the localization of Cdt1 in the nucleus was also detected
in these cells with mitotic DNA damage, Cdt1 continued
to accumulate in the nucleus even after 12 hours (Figure
5B, Cdt1 in b). In p53+/+ cells, Cdt1 was also localized
in the nucleus and its diffusion into the cytoplasm was
detected in cells 8 hours after release (Figure 5B, Cdt1 in

a & b). A BrdU incorporation assay revealed that p53-/cells perform DNA replication after 24 hours of release
in response to mitotic DNA damage (Figure 5D, lane 2
in p53-/-). Conversely, the ratio of the BrdU incorporation
was remarkably low in p53+/+ cells with mitotic DNA
damage (Figure 5D, lane 2 in p53+/+), suggesting that
DNA replication in p53+/+ cells is blocked after pre-RC
formation during mitotic DNA damage recovery. These
data indicated that pre-RC is formed in both types of cells
with mitotic DNA damage, and that cells seem to enter
into the S phase normally. However, DNA replication
might be inhibited by p53, which was tightly localized
in the nucleus during release after mitotic DNA damage
(Figure 5B, panels p53 in d and Figure 5D, graph 2 in
p53+/+).

c). The Cdt1 in the p53+/+ cells with mitotic DNA damage
was localized tightly in the nucleus during incubation
in fresh media in a pattern similar to those in p53-/- cells
with mitotic DNA damage (Figure 5B, Cdt1 in b & d).
Interestingly, the localization pattern for p53 was different
depending on the mitotic DNA damage in the cells. p53
in cells without DNA damage was not localized tightly in
the nucleus during the cell cycle progression (Figure 5B,
p53 in c), but cells with mitotic DNA damage retained
p53 localization in the nucleus even after 12 hours of
incubation (Figure 5B, p53 in d). These data indicate that
the nuclear localization of Cdt1 for pre-RC formation
was not relevant to the presence of p53 during the mitotic
DNA damage response. Geminin, a Cdt1 inhibitor also
disappeared for pre-RC formation from mitotic DNA
damage in both p53-/- and p53+/+ cells after 8 hour-release
(Figure 5C, lanes 5 in α-geminin in a & b). Additionally,
the inactivation of Cdk2 was detected at the same time
for both types of cells (Figure 5C, lanes 5 in α-p-cdk2
in a & b), and the active phosphorylation of cdk2 on
threonine-160 as well as the level of cyclin A, the partner
of Cdk2 during the S phase, were restored within 24 hours
of release (Figure 5C, lanes 6 in α-cycA & α-p-cdk2 in

incubation, regardless of the presence of p53 (Figure 5B,
b & d and Figure 5C, lanes 5 in α-cdt1 in a & b). During
extended incubation, both types of cells moved into the
S-phase, where cdt1 disappeared and Cdk2/cyclinA was
activated by phosphorylation (Figure 5C, lanes 6 in α-cdt1,
α-cycA, and α-p-cdk2 in a & b). In spite of these similar
phenotypes for both types of cells during the mitotic DNA
damage response, multiploidy was detected only in p53-/cells (Figure 1B, a & b and Figure 2A, d). To understand
the formation of multiploidy during mitotic DNA damage
recovery in p53-/- cells, we investigated the relevance
of p21, one of the p53 downstream targets and a Cdk2
inhibitor. When DNA damage was induced in mitotic
p53+/+ cells, the endogenous level of p21 dramatically
increased during extended release in the same pattern as
p53 expression (Figure 2B, lanes 5-8 in a).
Without DNA damage, both p21+/+ and 21-/- cells
arrested in the prometaphase progressed through the
normal cell division cycle within 8 hours of incubation in
a manner independent of the presence of p21 (Figure 6A, a
& c). However, mitotic p21+/+ cells with DNA damage did
not replicate their DNA and were arrested in a 4N DNA
stage (Figure 6A, b). When mitotic p21-/- cells were treated
with doxorubicin and released into fresh media, cells with
8N-DNA content accumulated during extended incubation
of 48 hours (Figure 6A, d).
At the molecular level, endogenous p21 protein
interacted with both Cdk2 and Cdk2 phosphorylated
on Tyr-14 (Figure 6B, α-cdk2 & α-P-cdk2(Y14) in a).
Since cells accumulated in the G1-S phase after 24 hours
of incubation, Cdk2 likely became active, resulting in
removal of the inhibitory phosphorylation on Tyr-15
(Figure 6B, lane 4 in α-P-cdk2(Y14) in b). Therefore, the
interaction between p21 and Cdk2 would not be detected
(Figure 6B, lane 4 in α-P-cdk2(Y14) in a). Furthermore,
p21 interacted with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA) 8 hours after release (Figure 6B, lanes 3-4 in
α-PCNA in a), suggesting that when p21 is induced by
p53, DNA replication might be inhibited in the S phase
through an interaction between Cdk2 and PCNA during
the mitotic DNA damage response.

recovery incubation, even though the DNA breaks were
still present.
Previously, it was reported that prolonged mitosis
by treatment with nocodazole for 24-36 hours lead cell
death or mitotic slippage, and that G1-like arrest occur by
p53-dependent manner under low concentration of mitotic
inhibitor [33, 34]. In this report, we focused on the longterm recovery response to mitotic DNA damage. For this,

middle of the mitosis, ATM-Chk1 pathway is activated and Plk1
is dephosphorylated by PP2A and other phosphatases within 6
hours from release into fresh media [20, 21]. Then, cells fail to
finish-up cytokinesis, progress into interphase with 4N-DNA
contents, and initiate S-phase by pre-RC formation. Although
normal cells are ready to initiate DNA replication with preRC assembly and activation of Cdk2 under the severe DNA
damage condition, these cells are blocked in DNA replication
due to activation of G1-S checkpoint, and finally are removed
by induction of apoptosis within 24h. However, in the case of
p53-inactive or null cells, although DNA damage remains in
cells, they go through G1 phase with damage, and undergo rereplication within 24 hours of incubation for recovery. Since
then, cells might be adapted in multiploidy, and destined to be
a cancer.

DNA damage frequently occurs as a result of factors
endogenous and exogenous to the cells and can induce
cell death or tumorigenesis. Depending on the intensity
of the damage, cells can recover from damage, adapt
to the damage, or be removed due to death. In previous
reports, we studied the response to DNA damage that
occurred in the prometaphase, rather than the interphase.
DNA damage caused by doxorubicin shock and gammairradiation in mitotic cells did not induce mitotic arrest
during recovery, and these cells bypassed late mitotic
events including cytokinesis [20, 21]. Moreover, cells with
4N-DNA contents entered the G1-phase within 8 hours of

cells were treated with nocodazole for 12-16 hours for
collection of mitotic cells. These cells were divided and
reentered into G1 phase within 30 min in fresh medium
(Figure 5A). Cell death or mitotic slippage was not
detected. Under the same condition, mitotic cells with
DNA damage were arrested in G1-like phase and induced
cell death in p53-dependent way. Indeed, mitotic cells
collected from cell culture which was released from
thymidine double block also responded on the DNA
damage in the same phenotypes (Supplementary data1), suggested that cell death or mitotic slippage and rereplication during prolonged recovery of mitotic DNA
damage are not the effects from prolong mitosis.
In p53-/- cells, multiploidy with 8N-DNA content
was detected after 24-48 hours of damage recovery (Figure
1B, a & b and Figure 2A, d). Conversely, multiploidy was
not induced in cells with p53+/+ cells (Figure 1B, c-e and
2A, b). Moreover, the ectopic expression of p53 reduced
the population of cells with 8N-DNA contents (Figure
3C, panels b), indicating that p53 suppresses multiploidy
induction during long-term damage adaptation. Since
8N-DNA formation is caused by DNA replication, we
investigated the involvement of p53 in pre-RC formation
in the initiation of the S-phase. Cdt1 is a major component
of pre-RC and is normally assembled on the nucleus
in both p53-/- and p53+/+ cells with the same amount of
mitotic DNA damage (Figure 5B, b & d). Cdt1 becomes
inactivated and is released from the nucleus during the S
phase by Cdk2 activation [31, 35, 36], and geminin binds
directly to Cdt1 to inhibit the formation of pre-RC [37,
38]. As expected, the activation of geminin and Cdk2
is reduced in both p53+/+ and p53-/- cells during nuclear
localization of Cdt1 (Figure 5B, b & d and 5C, panels
α-Cdt1, α-CycA, & α-p-Cdk2). Under this condition,
Cyclin A, a Cdk2 partner in initiating the S-phase, is not
expressed (Figure 5C, lanes 4-5 in a & b). These data
indicate that p53 is not involved in the suppression of
the pre-RC assembly to inhibit DNA replication. On the
other hand, BrdU incorporation dramatically decreased in
p53-positive cells (Figure 5D, graphs 2). The inhibition of
DNA replication by p53 might be mediated by p21, one of
the inhibitors of Cdks. p21 interacts with Cdk2 and PCNA
and simultaneously inhibits the progression of the S-phase
and DNA replication (Figure 6B). Based on these data, p53
might be involved in the inhibition of the DNA replication
process and has no effect on the events that occur before
the initiation of the S phase. Both p53-/- and p53+/+ cells
failed to complete the late events of mitosis and did not
undergo cytokinesis (Figure 5A, b & d), indicating that
p53 has no influence in late mitotic progression, including
cytokinesis, in the short-term response to mitotic DNA
damage. So far, p53 was observed to be involved in the
G1 phase checkpoint, which protects against an abnormal
genome and induces cell cycle arrest before the S phase
in response to DNA damage [39-42]. Daughter cells that
divided during protracted mitosis are eventually arrested
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

at the G1 phase in a p53-dependent manner [43]. In our
study, p53-positive cells with mitotic DNA damage did
not progress to the DNA replication step, in contrast
to p53-/- cells with mitotic DNA damage. These data
indicate that the G1 checkpoint is activated in response
to mitotic DNA damage in the presence of p53, and that
the mitotic DNA damage response is connected to the G1
checkpoint by p53. If cells continue to possess damaged
DNA, apoptosis is induced in a p53-dependent manner.
Actually, the sub-G0 population of cells over-expressing
p53 with mitotic DNA damage increased even within 8
hours of incubation (Figure 3C, d). The active cleavage
of caspase-3 and PARP also increased within 8 hours in
cells expressing p53 compared to p53-/- cells (Figure 3D
& E, b). On the other hand, cell viability increased with
mitotic DNA damage when p53 was inactive or depleted
(Figure 3D & E, a). Instead of an increase in viability, cells
become multiploid through the accumulation of 8N-DNA
contents during re-replication, indicating adaption to the
DNA damage. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that
the mitotic DNA damage response is connected to the
p53-mediated G1 checkpoint for damage recovery. The
model in Figure 7 suggests that in the short-term response,
mitotic cells with DNA damage skip the late mitotic
processes. In the long-term response, cells choose their
fates: recovery, death, or adaptation. Under this condition,
cell death or damaged cell adaptation is determined by
the presence of p53. When p53 is not expressed and is
not activated in the cells, mitotic DNA damage induces
the accumulation of 8N-DNA contents, and the cells
might become tumorigenic. Conversely, p53 induces a G1
checkpoint mediated by p21 in the mitotic DNA damage
response, and cells are blocked from replicating DNA.
These cells are removed through apoptosis in a short
period of time.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture, treatments and transfection
Various cancer cells were maintained in DMEM
containing 10% FBS (Hyclone). To synchronize in
prometaphase, cells were treated with nocodazole (100 ng/
ml, Sigma) for 16 hours and collected by shake-off. For
induction of DNA damage, mitotic cells were treated with
doxorubicin (5 μM, Sigma) for 1h. For ectopic expression,
cells were transfected as described previously with
modification [21]. Briefly, cells were incubated in DMEM
containing 5% FBS before 3 hours of transfection, and
added with the precipitates of plasmid DNA and calcium
salt. After 16 hours, cells were washed, and harvested for
further study after incubation for 24 hours.

washing, cells were incubated in 0.3% Triton X-100 for
15 min. Cells were incubated in 2 M HCl for 20 min, were
neutralized using 0.1 M sodium borate for 2 min, and
were stained with FITC conjugated BrdU antibodies (BD
Pharmingen) in PBS containing 10% Tween 20 and 2%
horse serum. The fluorescence signals were detected and
captured by confocal microscopy (LSM510).

For analysis of DNA contents, cells were
trypsinized, fixed in 80 % ethanol for 16 hours, and treated
with RNaseA (100 μg/ml) at 37 oC for 2 hours. Cells
stained with propidium iodide (40 μg/ml) were analyzed
by flow cytometry with 30,000 events (FACScaliber,
Becton Dickinson). For analysis of cell death, we
followed the manufacture’s manual of Annexin V-FITC
apoptosis analysis kit (BD Pharmingen). Briefly, cells
were trypsinized and washed by ice-cold PBS twice.
1x105 cells are suspended in 100 μl of Binding buffer, and
5 μl of Annexin V-FITC (BD Pharmingen) and propidium
iodide were added. After incubation for 15 min, 400 μl
of Binding buffer were added, and analyses were carried
out using a flow cytometry. Data were processed with
WinMDI software.
