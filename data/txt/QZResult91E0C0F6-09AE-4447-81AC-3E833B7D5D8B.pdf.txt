Abstract
The lysosomal degradation pathway of autophagy has a crucial role in defence against infection,
neurodegenerative disorders, cancer and ageing. Accordingly, agents that induce autophagy may
have broad therapeutic applications. One approach to developing such agents is to exploit
autophagy manipulation strategies used by microbial virulence factors. Here we show that a
peptide, Tat–beclin 1—derived from a region of the autophagy protein, beclin 1, which binds

human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 Nef—is a potent inducer of autophagy, and interacts with
a newly identified negative regulator of autophagy, GAPR-1 (also called GLIPR2). Tat–beclin 1
decreases the accumulation of polyglutamine expansion protein aggregates and the replication of
several pathogens (including HIV-1) in vitro, and reduces mortality in mice infected with
chikungunya or West Nile virus. Thus, through the characterization of a domain of beclin 1 that
interacts with HIV-1 Nef, we have developed an autophagy-inducing peptide that has potential
efficacy in the treatment of human diseases.
Autophagy functions in metazoans in cellular and tissue homeostasis, physiology,
development, and protection against disease, and abnormalities in autophagy may contribute
to many different pathophysiological conditions1,2. Thus, strategies that augment autophagy
may prevent or treat human disease3. Although some drugs in clinical use are capable of
augmenting autophagy, these compounds exert pleiotropic effects, revealing an unmet need
to develop specific inducers of autophagy.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We sought to develop a specific autophagy-inducing agent with a potentially wide range of
therapeutic effects. As viruses often provide key insights into the functionally important
domains of host proteins, we investigated the molecular determinants governing the
interaction between beclin 1, an essential autophagy protein in the class III
phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K) complex involved in autophagic vesicle
nucleation4, and the HIV-1 virulence factor, Nef5. These investigations led us to identify a
Nef-interacting sequence of beclin 1 that is necessary and sufficient for autophagy induction
and which provided the basis for the development of an autophagy-inducing peptide drug
that has benefits in the clearance of polyglutamine expansion protein aggregates and the
treatment of infectious diseases.

The HIV-1 Nef-interacting domain of beclin 1

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

HIV-1 Nef acts as an antiautophagic maturation factor through interaction with beclin 1 (ref.
5) and is required for efficient viral replication and AIDS pathogenicity. To map the Nefinteracting domain of beclin 1, we co-transfected Flag-tagged beclin 1 deletion mutants
(amino acids 1–377, 141–450 and 257–450) with haemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Nef. These
Flag–beclin 1 mutants immunoprecipitated with Nef–HA (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b),
indicating that amino acids 257–337, a region in the beclin 1 evolutionarily conserved
domain (ECD)6,7, are involved in Nef binding. Studies with beclin 1 mutants containing
deletions in the ECD revealed that amino acids 267–299 were required for binding to Nef
(Supplementary Fig. 1c). Deletion of amino acids 267–284 weakened binding to Nef more
than deletion of amino acids 285–299 (Fig. 1a) but had no effect on binding to Vps34 (also
called PIK3C3) (Supplementary Fig. 2a), the class III PI(3)K that interacts with the beclin 1
ECD6. Thus, beclin 1 amino acids 267–284 in the ECD are crucial for beclin 1 binding to
Nef. These residues are also required for the autophagy function of beclin 1; Flag–beclin 1,
but not Flag–beclin 1( 267–284), increased starvation-induced autophagy in MCF7 cells
(that express low amounts of endogenous beclin 1 (ref. 8)) as measured by quantification of
GFP–LC3 dots, a marker of autophagosomes9 (Fig. 1b).

Tat–beclin 1 is an autophagy–inducing peptide
We hypothesized that amino acids 267–284 of beclin 1 may be sufficient to induce
autophagy, so we designed a cell-permeable peptide, Tat–beclin 1, composed of the HIV-1
Tat protein transduction domain (PTD)10 attached via a diglycine linker to 18 amino acids
derived from amino acids 267–284 of beclin 1 (Fig. 1c). Three substitutions were made (in
residues not conserved in all Atg6/beclin 1 orthologues, Supplementary Fig. 3) to enhance
peptide solubility. These substitutions had no effect on binding of full-length beclin 1 to Nef

(Supplementary Fig. 1d). The 18 amino acids derived from beclin 1 in Tat–beclin 1 were
randomly shuffled to generate a control peptide (Tat-scrambled, Fig. 1c). Circular dichroism
spectra of Tat–beclin 1 and Tat-scrambled revealed that both peptides are random coils
(Supplementary Fig. 4), which is consistent with corresponding structural elements of Tat11
and the beclin 1 ECD7.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We used several complementary methods9 to demonstrate that the Tat–beclin 1 peptide
induces autophagy. Treatment with Tat–beclin 1, but not Tat-scrambled, resulted in a dosedependent decrease in amounts of p62, a selective autophagy substrate, and a dosedependent conversion of the non-lipidated form of LC3, LC3-I, to the lipidated,
autophagosome-associated form of LC3, LC3-II, in multiple cell lines and primary murine
embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 5). A peptide consisting of
the HIV Tat PTD fused to the wild-type sequence of beclin 1 amino acids 267–284 was not
soluble in saline-based solutions; however, when dissolved in H2O, it induced LC3-II
conversion and p62 degradation more efficiently than Tat–beclin 1 (Supplementary Fig. 6).
The previously reported Tat–vFLIP 2 peptide12, derived from viral-encoded FLICE
inhibitory protein, induced autophagy as efficiently as Tat–beclin 1 (Supplementary Fig. 7).
In HeLa/GFP–LC3 cells13, Tat–beclin 1 increased GFP–LC3 dot numbers
(autophagosomes) 27-fold (Fig. 1e, f). Ultrastructurally, increased numbers of
autophagosomes and autolysosomes were observed in Tat–beclin 1-treated HeLa cells
(Supplementary Fig. 8a). Bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of autophagosomal/lysosomal fusion,
further increased amounts of LC3-II and p62 in Tat–beclin 1-treated HeLa and COS-7 cells,
indicating enhanced autophagic flux (Supplementary Fig. 8b). The magnitude of change in
p62 upon bafilomycin A1 treatment was similar in Tat–beclin 1-treated cells to that
observed in cells subjected to starvation (Supplementary Fig. 9). Long-lived protein
degradation was increased in Tat–beclin 1-treated cells, and partially blocked by 3methyladenine (3-MA), an autophagy inhibitor that targets class III PI(3)K (ref. 3)
(Supplementary Fig. 8c).
Together, these results indicate that the Tat–beclin 1 peptide induces a complete cellular
autophagy response. This response involves the canonical autophagy pathway, as short
interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of two essential autophagy genes, BECN1 (involved
in vesicle nucleation) and ATG7 (involved in the protein conjugation system)
(Supplementary Fig. 10), decreased the number of Tat–beclin 1-induced autophagosomes
(Fig. 1g). The upstream signalling events in Tat–beclin 1-induced autophagy might be
partially distinct from those in starvation-induced autophagy, as additive effects were
observed in cells simultaneously treated with Tat–beclin 1 and subjected to starvation
(Supplementary Fig. 11).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A sequence alignment of Atg6/beclin 1 orthologues revealed two conserved aromatic
residues within amino acids 267–284: F270 and F274 (Supplementary Fig. 3). In the beclin
1 ECD structure (a domain that binds to liposomes in vitro7 at the yellow-coloured site in
Fig. 1h), these aromatic side chains intercalate in the hydrophobic core in a T-shaped
geometry and help to position the intervening residues in a surface-exposed loop. They are
predicted to have a similar function in the Tat–beclin 1 peptide, thus contributing to its
structural stability (Fig. 1h). Consistent with this prediction, mutation of either of these two
residues to serine (F270S and F274S) abrogated the peptide’s autophagy-inducing activity
(Fig. 1i). Moreover, the subcellular localization of Tat–beclin 1(F270S) lacked the discrete
punctate appearance of Tat–beclin 1 (Supplementary Fig. 12).

Tat–beclin 1 binds the autophagy inhibitor GAPR–1
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We performed biochemical analyses to identify cellular proteins that bind to a biotinconjugated form of the autophagy-inducing Tat–beclin 1 peptide. A protein that migrated at
a molecular mass between 15 and 20 kDa bound to biotin–Tat–beclin 1 but not biotin–Tatscrambled (Supplementary Fig. 13). This band was identified by liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) as Golgi-associated plant pathogenesis-related
protein 1 (GAPR-1) (also known as GLIPR2), a protein that associates with lipid rafts at the
cytosolic leaflet of the Golgi membrane14. Endogenous GAPR-1, but not Vps34,
immunoprecipitated with the biotin–Tat–beclin 1 peptide (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig.
2b). Flag–beclin 1, but not Flag–beclin 1(D267–284), immunoprecipitated with GAPR-1 in
HeLa cells expressing GAPR-1–Myc and Flag–beclin 1 (Fig. 2b). Thus, amino acids 267–
284 of beclin 1 are necessary and sufficient for beclin 1 to bind GAPR-1. Biotin conjugates
of mutant peptides defective in autophagy induction (Fig. 1i) failed to bind to GAPR-1 (Fig.
2a).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To evaluate the function of GAPR-1 in autophagy, we treated HeLa/GFP–LC3 cells with
siRNAs directed against GAPR-1 (Supplementary Fig. 14a). Knockdown of GAPR-1 led to
increased numbers of autophagosomes in both Tat-scrambled- and Tat–beclin 1-treated cells
(Fig. 2c). This was due to an increase in autophagic flux, rather than a block in
autophagosome maturation, as numbers of autophagosomes increased further upon
bafilomycin A1 treatment. (We infer that the number of lysosomes available for
autophagolysosomal fusion may be rate-limiting, as absolute numbers of autolysosomes did
not increase (Supplementary Fig. 15).) Taken together, our data indicate that GAPR-1 is a
beclin 1-interacting protein that negatively regulates autophagy.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We examined the subcellular localization of endogenous beclin 1 after Tat–beclin 1
treatment, GAPR-1 overexpression or GAPR-1 knockdown (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig.
14). Beclin 1 levels were not affected by GAPR-1 overexpression or GAPR-1 knockdown.
In control-transfected HeLa cells treated with control peptide, beclin 1 staining
predominantly overlapped with a Golgi apparatus marker (GM130). After Tat–beclin 1
peptide treatment, beclin 1 redistributed to non-Golgi subcellular compartments; beclin 1
demonstrated co-labelling with markers for organelles such as endosomes (EEA1),
lysosomes (LAMP1) and endoplasmic reticulum (PD1) (data not shown). In addition, we
observed a significant increase in the number of punctate structures containing WIPI2 (Fig.
2f and Supplementary Fig. 16), a mammalian protein that binds to phosphatidylinositol 3phosphate at the site of early autophagosomal structures15. In HeLa cells expressing
GAPR-1–Myc, Tat–beclin 1 treatment resulted in less redistribution of beclin 1 to non-Golgi
sites and decreased WIPI2 puncta. Conversely, even in the absence of Tat–beclin 1 peptide,
GAPR-1 siRNA knockdown led to an increase in beclin 1 redistribution to non-Golgi sites
and in WIPI2 puncta.
To confirm that Tat–beclin 1 induced beclin 1 localization to non-Golgi sites, we measured
the amounts of beclin 1 in purified HeLa cell Golgi fractions after peptide treatment (Fig.
2e). In control-transfected cells, treatment with Tat–beclin 1 led to the disappearance of
beclin 1 in the Golgi fraction, whereas in cells expressing GAPR-1–Myc, increased amounts
of beclin 1 were detected in the Golgi fraction, which were only minimally decreased by
treatment with Tat–beclin 1. Thus, GAPR-1 may function to tether beclin 1 in the Golgi
apparatus (where it is inactive in autophagy), and the Tat–beclin 1 peptide may promote the
release of beclin 1 from the Golgi, resulting in enhanced early autophagosome formation.
Other unknown mechanisms may also contribute to the autophagy-inducing activity of Tat–
beclin 1.

Tat–beclin 1 has beneficial effects in vitro
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Our discovery that Tat–beclin 1 is an inducer of autophagy led us to explore whether it may
represent a candidate therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative diseases and infectious
diseases. Pharmacological activation of autophagy reduces levels of soluble and aggregated
proteins involved in polyglutamine repeat expansion disorders (such as Huntington’s
disease, the spinocerebellar ataxias, and synucleinopathies and tauopathies) and reduces
their cytotoxicity in vitro and neurotoxicity in mouse or Drosophila models3,16. We
therefore investigated whether Tat–beclin 1 peptide treatment decreases aggregates of a
model polyglutamine expansion protein (htt103Q) derived from exon 1 of human mutant
huntingtin protein17.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In HeLa cells expressing doxycyline-repressible CFP fused to htt103Q (ref. 17), Tat–beclin
1 treatment did not affect the number of large (>1 m) CFP–htt103Q aggregates (data not
shown), consistent with previous reports that autophagy does not clear large protein
aggregates16. In contrast, Tat–beclin 1 treatment decreased the number of small (<1 m)
CFP–htt103Q aggregates as efficiently as doxycycline (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 17).
(Similar results were obtained using Torin1, an inhibitor of mTOR that induces autophagy3
(Supplementary Fig. 18).) We confirmed our findings biochemically using a filter trap assay
that separates large protein aggregates, small protein aggregates and soluble proteins; Tat–
beclin 1 decreased small htt103Q aggregates to a similar degree as doxycycline (Fig. 3b).
Tat–beclin 1 peptide also decreased amounts of soluble htt103Q protein, indicating that Tat–
beclin 1 can clear the pre-aggregated and small aggregated form of htt103Q protein. Further
studies are required to determine whether Tat–beclin 1 peptide is effective in animal models
of full-length disease-causing polyglutamine expansion proteins.

Autophagy genes have beneficial effects in animal models of certain viral and intracellular
bacterial infections, and autophagy-inducing agents (such as rapamycin and vitamin D)
inhibit HIV replication in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs)3. We
therefore investigated the effects of the Tat–beclin 1 peptide on the replication of three
positive-stranded RNA viruses (Sindbis virus (SINV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), West
Nile virus (WNV)), HIV-1, and the intracellular bacterium, Listeria monocytogenes. Tat–
beclin 1 treatment (10 M for 4 h beginning 4 h post-infection) reduced SINV, CHIKV and
WNV titres 10–50-fold in HeLa cells (Fig. 3c). Tat–beclin 1 treatment reduced CHIKV
replication even if administered 24 h post-infection (Supplementary Fig. 19). Tat–beclin 1mediated reduction in viral titres was not due to peptide cytotoxicity, as the peptide did not
kill uninfected cells (Supplementary Fig. 20a) and there was increased, rather than
decreased, cell survival in Tat–beclin 1 peptide-treated virally infected cells (data not
shown). Thus, the decreased viral titres probably reflect xenophagic degradation of the
viruses or other antiviral effects of increased autophagy.
Tat–beclin 1 peptide decreased the intracellular survival of L. monocytogenes in primary
murine bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) (Fig. 3d). We used a strain of L.
monocytogenes lacking the autophagy evasion protein, ActA18, and a dose of the peptide
(10 M for 2 h) that is non-toxic to uninfected BMDMs (Supplementary Fig. 20b, c). This
antibacterial effect was decreased in BMDMs derived from Atg5flox/floxlysozymeM-Cre
mice19 that had decreased Atg5 expression and decreased Tat–beclin 1-induced autophagy
(Supplementary Fig. 21).
Tat–beclin 1 markedly inhibited HIV-1 replication in primary human MDMs. Using an
established pre-treatment model20,21, we observed a dose-dependent inhibition of HIV p24
antigen release in MDMs cultured in the presence of non-toxic concentrations (0.5, 1, 2.5,
and 5 M) of Tat–beclin 1, with nearly undetectable antigen levels in cells treated daily with

5 M Tat–beclin 1 peptide (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 22). The magnitude of inhibition
of HIV-1 replication was similar to that observed with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin,
which also induces autophagy (Supplementary Fig. 23). Tat–beclin 1 peptide-mediated
inhibition of HIV-1 replication appeared to occur via the canonical autophagy pathway, as
short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of the essential autophagy gene, ATG5
(Supplementary Fig. 22c), decreased Tat–beclin 1-induced autophagy (as assessed by LC3
lipidation (Fig. 3g)) and completely abrogated the antiviral effects of Tat–beclin 1 treatment
(Fig. 3f) without any decrease in cell survival (Supplementary Fig. 22d).

Tat–beclin 1 induces autophagy in vivo

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To show that Tat–beclin 1 induces autophagy in vivo, we examined numbers of
autophagosomes in tissues of mice that transgenically express GFP–LC3 (ref. 22) and
compared two forms of Tat–beclin 1, including the sequence in Fig. 1c composed of L-amino
acids, and a retro-inverso sequence of Tat–beclin 1 composed of D-amino acids, which is
predicted to be more resistant to proteolytic degradation23. Significantly more GFP–LC3
dots (autophagosomes) were observed in skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle and pancreas after
intraperitoneal (i.p.) treatment with the L- or D-form of Tat–beclin 1 as compared to the Lform of Tat-scrambled or D-form of Tat (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 24). By imaging
tissue stained with streptavidin linked to an infrared dye, we confirmed that biotinconjugated Tat–beclin 1 enters muscle cells (Supplementary Fig. 25). In 5-day-old suckling
mouse brains, treatment with the D-form (but not L-form) of Tat–beclin 1 reduced p62 levels
(Fig. 4b). Thus, Tat–beclin 1 can induce autophagy in peripheral tissues in adult mice as
well as in the central nervous system of neonatal mice.
Daily Tat–beclin 1 peptide treatment was well-tolerated in both neonatal and adult mice.
During a 2-week course, neonatal mice had normal weight gain, motor activity, renal
function and clinical status as well as normal histology of the heart, kidney, brain and liver
(Supplementary Fig. 26 and Supplementary Table 1, and data not shown). These parameters,
as well as hepatic and haematological function, were also normal in Tat–beclin 1 peptidetreated 3-month-old mice (Supplementary Table 1 and data not shown).

Tat–beclin 1 improves clinical outcomes

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We investigated the effect of the Tat–beclin 1 peptide on the outcome of neonatal infection
with CHIKV and WNV. After subcutaneous (s.c.) inoculation with CHIKV, neonatal mice
develop lethal infection similar to that observed in human neonates, characterized by flaccid
paralysis and abundant viral replication in muscle, skin and joints24. Tat–beclin 1 peptide
treatment (15 mg kg−1 i.p. daily, L-form, beginning one day post-infection) reduced viral
titres at day 4 and day 6 in the soleus and vastus lateralis muscles (Supplementary Fig. 27a)
and decreased clinical paralysis (data not shown). In neonatal GFP–LC3 transgenic mice,
autophagosomes were increased in muscle, including in cells that expressed CHIKV E2
envelope glycoprotein (Supplementary Fig. 27b). Importantly, Tat–beclin 1 treatment
reduced mortality of neonatal mice infected with CHIKV; 100% of mice treated with control
Tat-scrambled peptide died as compared to 62.5% of mice treated with Tat–beclin 1 peptide
(Fig. 4c).
Arbovirus infections of the central nervous system (CNS) in human infants are often lethal
and have no effective treatment25,26. We evaluated the effects of the Tat–beclin 1 peptide (Dform) on clinical outcome in a neonatal mouse model of WNV CNS infection. Tat–beclin 1
peptide treatment increased brain viral titres at day 2 post-infection, but resulted in more
than a 1,000-fold reduction in brain viral titres by day 6 post-infection (Supplementary Fig.
28). The brains of control Tat peptide (D-form)-treated mice had higher levels of viral
antigen staining at day 4 and day 6 post-infection, more neuropathology, and more cell death

than those of Tat–beclin 1 peptide-treated mice (Fig. 4d, e and data not shown). Tat–beclin 1
peptide treatment also significantly reduced mortality in WNV-infected mice (Fig. 4f). (The
antiviral effects of Tat–beclin 1 in vivo may be autophagy-dependent, as CNS viral titres
were not reduced in Tat–beclin 1 peptide-treated mice with monoallelic deletion of Becn1
(Fig. 4g).) Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the Tat–beclin 1 peptide improves
the clinical outcome of mice with CNS WNV infection.

Discussion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

By mapping the domain of beclin 1 targeted by the HIV-1 pathogenicity protein, Nef, we
identified a functionally important region of beclin 1, leading to the synthesis of a cellpermeable autophagy-inducing peptide and the discovery of a negative regulator of
autophagy, GAPR-1. The autophagy-inducing activity of the peptide was associated with
clearance of small polyglutamine expansion protein aggregates, reduced titres of several
positive-stranded RNA viruses, decreased intracellular survival of the bacterium, L.
monocytogenes, inhibition of HIV-1 replication in human macrophages, and a reduction in
the mortality of neonatal mice infected with CHIKV and WNV. Because autophagy
dysregulation may underlie the pathogenesis of metabolic, inflammatory and neoplastic
diseases (in addition to its role in infections and neurodegenerative disorders), specific
autophagy-inducing agents such as the Tat–beclin 1 peptide may have potential for the
prevention and treatment of a broad range of human diseases.

Immunoblot analyses
Cells were rinsed with Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (PBS(−), (Sigma)) and lysed in
lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, protease
inhibitor cocktail (Roche)) on ice for 1 h. Lysates were centrifuged at 16,100g for 10 min at
4 °C, and resolved by SDS–PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were
blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk (NFDM) in PBST (PBS 0.05% Tween-20), incubated
overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies in PBST containing 5% NFDM, washed with
PBST, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with HRP-conjugated secondary
antibodies diluted in PBST containing 5% NFDM. Immunoreactive bands were visualized
with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific) or Amersham
ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare).

For detection of beclin 1 and GAPR-1 in Golgi fractions of HeLa cells and HeLa/GAPR-1–
Myc cells, Golgi-enriched fractions were isolated as described34,35 from cells treated with
peptide (20 M, 1 h), then trypsinized and homogenized with a Balch homogenizer (gap size
9 m). Post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) was obtained after centrifugation of the cell
homogenate (1,700 r.p.m., 10 min, 4 °C). The PNS was fractionated by sucrose density
gradient ultracentrifugation (SV40 rotor at 100,000g, 2 h 40 min) and approximately 1 ml of
a Golgi-enriched fraction was collected at the 35–29% sucrose interface. Membranes were
pelleted by ultracentrifugation (100,000g, 30 min) after the addition of three volumes of
PBS to one volume of Golgi-enriched fraction.
Immunoprecipitation
Cell lysates were centrifuged at 16,100g for 10 min at 4 °C and the supernatants were
subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-HA antibody (1:100 dilution, Roche) and
protein G plus-agarose (Santa Cruz) or with anti-Myc agarose (1:20 dilution, Santa Cruz)
and subjected to immunoblot analyses.
Cell viability assays
Cytotoxicity was measured in HeLa cells using an LDH cytotoxicity kit (Cayman
Chemical). Cytotoxicity in primary human MDMs was measured using WST-1 (Roche).

Fluorescence microscopy and image analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For measurement of autophagy in HeLa/GFP–LC3 cells or MCF7 cells, cells were fixed
with 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS, and GFP–LC3-positive dots per cell was
quantified as described29. To measure autophagic flux, HeLa cells were co-transfected with
an mRFP–GFP–LC3 plasmid32 and siRNA, treated with peptide (25 M, 3 h) 72 h posttransfection, and then fixed as above. GFP-positive autophagosomes and RFP-positive
autolysosomes per cell were quantified. For the htt103Q aggregate assay, CFP-positive
aggregates <1 m were counted.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For immunofluorescence (IFA) analysis of cultured cells, HeLa cells were fixed as above,
permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS, blocked with 0.5% BSA in PBS, stained with
anti-WIPI215 (mouse, 1:500), anti-beclin 1 (rabbit, 1: 250, Santa Cruz), anti-GM130
(mouse, 1:250, Novus Biologicals), and labelled with goat-anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 647 and
goat-anti-mouse AlexaFluor 488 secondary antibodies (1:500) or stained with antistreptavidin-AlexaFluor 488 (1:500) (after treatment with Tat–biotin-conjugated peptides).
For the beclin 1 primary antibody, specificity was confirmed by siRNA knockdown. Zstacks were acquired with a Zeiss AxioImager M2 microscope equipped with a Photometrics
CoolSnap HQ2 camera using a Zeiss PLAN APO 20X/0.8 NA wide-field objective with the
same acquisition times for samples stained with identical primary antibody pairs, then
deconvolved with AutoDeBlur (Biotplane). Imaris version 7.4.0 (Bitplane) was used for
analysis. Thresholding for background secondary antibody staining was performed in all
experiments. Representative images were chosen after examining 60–120 cells from
triplicate samples for each condition. Nuclear staining (besides DAPI) was masked using the
DAPI channel and setting non-DAPI signal within the nuclear surface to zero.
Quantification of WIPI2-positive dots per cell was performed by an observer blinded to
experimental condition.
For IFA of mouse tissues, 5-day-old GFP–LC3 transgenic mice infected with CHIKV were
treated with peptide (20 mg kg−1, 6 h). Muscle sections were prepared as described in the
section below, stained with an anti-CHIKV E2 antibody13,36, and images were acquired as
described for cultured cells above. For infrared (IR) dye images, muscle tissue was collected
from peptide-treated GFP–LC3 mice (25 mg kg−1 i.p., 2 h), and sections were stained with
streptavidin-conjugated IRDye 800CW (1:500 dilution; Licor). Images were acquired with a
Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu OrcaII-ER camera using a
Zeiss PLAN APO 63×/1.4 NA oil objective and analysed by an observer blinded to
experimental condition.

Electron microscopy

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

HeLa cells were fixed overnight with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M (pH 7.4) cacodylate
buffer and samples were prepared and analysed as described8.
Immunohistochemistry
Mouse brain sections were fixed in 4% PFA. Paraffin-embedded sagittal sections were
TUNEL-stained to detect apoptotic nuclei (Apoptag peroxidase in situ Apoptosis Detection
Kit; Chemicon International). Immunoperoxidase staining was performed to detect WNV
antigen (rat polyclonal anti-WNV antibody; 1:100 dilution; provided by M. Diamond).
Peptide design
An evolutionary trace (ET) analysis37 revealed regions within the 267–299 domain of beclin
1 likely to be of evolutionary importance. To enhance the solubility of the Tat PTD (amino
acids 47–57)10 fused to the beclin 1 267–284 fragment, ET analysis of beclin 1 further
identified residue positions unlikely to be functionally important occupied by charged
residues in beclin 1 orthologues. These cognate residues were then substituted into the
peptide (H275E, S79D and Q281E) to increase its solubility without disrupting its mimicry
of beclin 1 function.

Peptide synthesis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

-amino acid peptides were synthesized by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center (UTSW) Protein Chemistry Technology Core and purified to >95% by HPLC
(confirmed by mass spectrometry). The Tat–beclin 1 peptide sequence,
YGRKKRRQRRRGGTNVFNATFEIWHDGEFGT, consisted of 11 amino acids from the
Tat PTD at the N terminus, a GG linker to increase flexibility, and at the C terminus, 18
amino acids derived from beclin 1 267–284 containing three substitutions, including H275E,
S279D, Q281E. Wild-type Tat–beclin 1 peptide consisted of the Tat PTD, a GG linker, and
18 amino acids derived from the natural beclin 1 sequence (267–284)
(YGRKKRRQRRRGGTNVFNATFHIWHSGQFGT). Control peptide, Tat-scrambled,
consisted of the Tat protein transduction domain, a GG linker, and a scrambled version of
the C-terminal 18 amino acids from Tat–beclin 1
(YGRKKRRQRRRGGVGNDFFINHETTGFATEW). For experiments comparing Tat–
beclin 1 and Tat-scrambled, peptides were dissolved in PBS(−), whereas in the experiment
comparing Tat–beclin 1 and wild-type Tat–beclin 1, peptides were dissolved in H2O.
Peptides were stored at −80 °C. For peptide treatment, cells were washed with PBS(−) and
treated with peptides (10–50 M, 1–4 h) dissolved in OPTI-MEM (Gibco) acidified with
0.15% (v/v) 6N HCl. For treatment of primary human MDMs, cells were washed with PBS
and pre-treated with peptides (0.5–5 M, 24 h) in 500 l macrophage-SFM (serum-free
media) (Gibco) before infection with HIV-1.
L

-amino acid peptides were synthesized at the HHMI Mass Spectrometry Laboratory at UCBerkeley. The retro-inverso Tat–beclin 1 D-amino acid sequence was
RRRQRRKKRGYGGTGFEGDHWIEFTANFVNT. Peptides were synthesized by solidphase methodology on Wang resin of 0.44 meq g−1 substitution using an ABI 431A
synthesizer. Appropriate N-FMOC amino acid derivatives were coupled via
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide activation in dichloro-methane/N-methylpyrrolidone using userdevised extended activation, coupling and piperidine deprotection cycles. Dried resinpeptide was deprotected in reagent K 4 h at room temperature. Peptide was extracted with
warm acetonitrile/water, lyophilized, and purified by RPLC. Crude peptide purity was
roughly 75%; after purification, 95%. D-amino acid peptides were dissolved in H2O and
stored at −80 °C until use. Peptide purity was assessed by FTICR mass spectrometry.

Circular dichroism spectroscopy

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

CD spectra of the Tat–beclin 1 and Tat-scrambled peptides were recorded on an AVIV
62DS spectropolarimeter.
Model of beclin 1 peptide
The beclin 1 peptide model was adopted from the corresponding elements of the ECD
structure7 (Protein Data Bank accession 4DDP). The first two residues after the diglycine
linker are disordered in the ECD structure and were omitted. The side chains of the residues
mutated to increase solubility were modelled using the mutagenesis wizard of PyMOL,
keeping rotamers with no steric clashes.
Measurement of long-lived protein degradation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

COS-7 cells cultured in 6-well plates were incubated in 10% FBS/DMEM containing L-3H
leucine (1 Ci ml−1) (Perkin Elmer) and 65 M of unlabelled leucine for 3 days. Cells were
washed with 10% FBS-DMEM three times and incubated with 10% FBS/DMEM containing
unlabelled leucine (2 M) for 1 day. After washing three times with normal medium, cells
were treated with indicated peptide or EBSS for 2 h with or without 3-MA. The medium was
precipitated with 10% TCA and TCA-soluble radioactivity was measured. Cells were fixed
by 10% TCA, lysed in 0.2N NaOH and total cell radioactivity was measured. L-3H-leucine
release was estimated as a percentage of the radioactivity in the TCA-soluble material
relative to the total cell radioactivity.
Protein purification and mass spectrometry
Tat-scrambled and Tat–beclin 1 peptides were conjugated at their N termini to biotin via a
PEG(3) linkage by the UTSW Protein Chemistry Technology Core. Approximately 8 × 106
HeLa cells were treated with biotinylated peptides (30 M, 3 h), lysed in lysis buffer (20
mM HEPES, 137 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol and protease
inhibitor cocktail) and homogenized using a 25G syringe. Lysates were mixed with M-280
streptavidin Dynabeads (Invitrogen) overnight and 20 l of laemmli sample buffer was
added. After separation by SDS–PAGE, bands were visualized by GelCode blue stain
reagent (Thermo Scientific), excised and analysed by LC-MS/MS at the UTSW Protein
Chemistry Technology Core. All MS/MS spectra were searched against the protein sequence
database at the NCBI using Mascot software.
Filter trap assay

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A filter trap assay was performed to measure amounts of soluble htt103Q protein, small
htt103Q aggregates (P2 supernatant) and large htt103Q aggregates (P1 supernatant) in
HeLa-htt103Q cells as described17,38.
Virus strains and infection
SINV strain SV1A (ATCC) has been described previously39. WNV strain TX0240 was
provided by M. Gale and WNV strain Egypt 10141 was provided by M. Diamond. CHIKV
strain CHIKV-21 was propagated as described42. All in vitro virus infections were
performed at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 in reduced serum (1% heat-inactivated
FBS) containing media for 1 h. For titration of viruses in mouse tissues, 10% homogenates
of freeze-thawed tissue were used. Viral stocks, cell culture supernatants, and tissue
homogenates were titred by plaque assay titration using BHK-21 cells for SINV and CHIKV
and Vero cells for WNV.
For HIV-1 experiments, 5 × 105 MDMs were treated with peptide at the indicated dose for
24 h, infected with HIV-1Ba-L (provided by S. Gartner and R. Gallo)43 at an MOI of 0.01 for

3 h, washed 3× with PBS, and then incubated with macrophage-SFM containing the peptide
for 10 days. At days 3, 5, 7 and 10, 250 l of cell supernatant was collected and fresh 250 l
macrophage-SFM containing the peptides was added. Extracellular release of HIV-1 p24
antigen into the supernatants was measured using the Alliance HIV-1 p24 antigen enzymelinked immunosorbent assay kit (ELISA; PerkinElmer).
Listeria infection
Primary BMDMs were collected from C57/BL6J mice and cultured for 6 days. On day 7,
BMDMs were plated in DMEM containing 20% FBS and 20% L-cell supernatant and no
antibiotics, and infected 24 h later with the Listeria actA mutant strain DPL-402927
(provided by M. Shiloh) at an MOI of 5 c.f.u. per cell for 30 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2, then
gently washed three times with PBS and treated with either 10 M Tat-scrambled or Tat–
beclin 1 peptide for 2 h. After 2 h, cells were washed three times with PBS to remove
extracellular bacteria and peptide and the medium was replaced with non-antibioticcontaining medium. BMDMs were lysed in 0.3% Triton X-100 at serial time points and
serial dilutions were plated on LB agar overnight at 37 °C for determination of c.f.u.
Animal experiments

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To measure autophagy in mouse tissues, 6-week-old GFP–LC3 transgenic mice22 were
injected i.p. with Tat-scrambled (L-amino acid), Tat–beclin 1 (L-amino acid) and Tat–beclin 1
(D-amino acid) peptide at 20 mg kg−1 (5.3 mol kg−1) or with Tat (D-amino acid) peptide at
5.3 mol kg−1. After 6 h, mice were killed and fixed by perfusion with 4% PFA in PBS.
Tissues were fixed in 4% PFA overnight, 15% sucrose for 4 h, and 30% sucrose overnight
before frozen sections were prepared and used for fluorescence microscopy analysis as
described44. For immunoblot analysis, 5-day-old GFP–LC3 mice were injected i.p. with Tatscrambled (L-amino acid), Tat–beclin 1 (L-amino acid) and Tat–beclin 1 (D-amino acid)
peptide at 20 mg kg−1 (5.3 mol kg−1) or with Tat (D-amino acid) peptide at 5.3 mol kg−1.
Six hours later, mice were killed and frozen brain tissue homogenates were used. For virus
infections, CHIKV and WNV Egypt strain were diluted in HBSS and used to infect 5-dayold C57BL/6J mice with 106 p.f.u. s.c or 1 p.f.u. i.c., respectively. For assessment of peptide
toxicity, 6-day-old C57BL/6J mice were injected i.p. with Tat-scrambled (L-amino acid) or
Tat–beclin 1 (L-amino acid) at 15 mg kg−1 and with Tat (D-amino acid) at 5.3 mmol kg−1 or
Tat–beclin 1 (D-amino acid) at 20 mg kg−1 daily for 2 weeks. Body weight, neurological
status and general clinical status was monitored daily, and blood, liver, spleen, heart and
brain samples were collected upon death after 2 weeks of peptide treatment. For serum
biochemistry and haematological analyses in adult mice, 3-month-old C57BL/6J mice were
injected i.p. with Tat-scrambled (L-amino acid) or Tat–beclin 1 (L-amino acid) at 20 mg kg−1
daily for 2 weeks before blood collection. Animal experiments were approved by the UTSW
Institutional Animal Care Use Committee and performed in accordance with institutional
guidelines.
Retroviral expression system

GAPR-1 (also known as GLIPR2) cDNA (Origene) was subcloned into pBABE-puro
(Addgene) by PCR. To generate pBabe-GAPR-1-Myc, GAPR-1 cDNA was fused with a
Myc sequence at the C terminus by PCR and subcloned into pBABE-puro. To produce
retroviruses, 4 g of pBABE-GAPR-1 was transfected into 293T cells with 3.6 g of
pUMVC (Addgene) and 0.4 g of pCMV-VSV-G (Addgene). At 2 and 3 days after
transfection, the viral supernatants were collected and filtered through a 0.45- m membrane
filter and the viral supernatants were used to infect HeLa cells in the presence of 6 g ml−1
of polybrene. At 24 h post-infection, fresh viral supernatants with polybrene were added to
the cells for a second round of infection. After an additional 24 h, cells were cultured with
10% FBS/DMEM with 4 g ml−1 puromycin.
