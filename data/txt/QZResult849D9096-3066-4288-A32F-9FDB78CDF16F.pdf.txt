ABSTRACT
Microtubule Targeting Agents (MTAs) induce cell death through mitotic arrest, preferentially
affecting rapidly dividing cancer cells over slowly proliferating normal cells. Previously, we showed
that Methyl 2-(-5-fluoro-2-hydroxyphenyl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole-5-carboxylate (MBIC) acts as
a potential MTA. In this study, we demonstrated that MBIC exhibits greater toxicity towards nonaggressive breast cancer cell-line, MCF-7 (IC50 = 0.73 ± 0.0 μM) compared to normal fibroblast

cell-line, L-cells (IC50 = 59.6 ± 2.5 μM). The IC50 of MBIC against the aggressive breast cancer
cell-line, MDA-MB-231 was 20.4 ± 0.2 μM. We hypothesized that the relatively high resistance of

MDA-MB-231 cells to MBIC is associated with p53 mutation. We investigated p53 and three of its
downstream proteins: survivin, cyclin dependent kinase (Cdk1) and cyclin B1. Following treatment
with MBIC, survivin co-immunoprecipitated with caspases with higher affinity in MDA-MB-231
compared to MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, silencing survivin caused a 4.5-fold increase in sensitivity
of MDA-MB-231 cells to MBIC (IC50 = 4.4 ± 0.3). In addition, 4 weeks of MBIC administration in
MDA-MB-231 cells inoculated BALB/c nude mice resulted in 79.7% reduction of tumor volume
compared to the untreated group with no severe sign of toxicity. Our results demonstrated MBIC
has multiple anti-tumor actions and could be a potential drug in breast cancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION

Microtubule Targeting Agents (MTAs) were
introduced as anti-tumor agents as early as 1950s. Until
recently, it has been postulated that MTAs kill cells only
through mitotic arrest [7]. However, several MTAs such as
taxanes and epothilones besides stabilizing microtubules,
activate spindle assembly checkpoint proteins and
suppress cell proliferation [8]. Taxanes are the most
widely used MTAs for the treatment of metastatic breast
cancer. However, their anti-cancer effects frequently fail
due to the resistance of cells to this drug [9]. Recently,
we reported that Methyl 2-(5-fluoro-2-hydroxyphenyl)1H-benzo[d]imidazole-5-carboxylate (MBIC) is a highly
selective MTA that showed greater toxicity toward cancer
cells compared to normal cells [10]. In this study, we
explored the efficacy of MBIC against aggressive and
metastatic human breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231 cells
in both in vitro and in vivo, along with non-aggressive
human breast cancer MCF-7 cells.

Deregulation of cell cycle leads to cancer,
characterized by abnormal chromosome segregation and
uncontrolled cell proliferation [1]. The majority of cancer
related deaths are due to chemo-resistance of metastatic
cells to conventional therapy [2]. Cancer metastasis is
a selective cell survival process. Non-metastatic cells
are unable to pass one or several steps of the metastatic
cascade, while metastatic cells are able to overcome all the
steps. These different characteristics may yield different
responses to chemotherapeutic drugs [3]. Breast cancer is
one of the highly prevalent cancers among women, and is
among the top ten cancers worldwide [4, 5]. Breast cancer
metastasizes to the liver, lungs, bones and responds poorly
to conventional chemotherapy in most cases [6]. Hence,
there is a dire need for novel drugs to treat breast cancer
with a proper mechanism.

Cells contain mitotic proteins that regulate spindle
assembly and mitosis, such as survivin, Cdk1 and
cyclin B1. Their essential roles begin in G2-M phase [11].
MDA-MB-231 cells contain mutated p53 [12]. Survivin
which is involved in both apoptosis and mitosis [13],
is negatively regulated by wild-type p53 [14]. Under
normal circumstances, survivin attachment to caspases
avoids caspase-dependent apoptosis [15]. In this study,
we examined the roles of p53, survivin and caspases in
the development of resistance in MDA-MB-231 cells to
MBIC. In addition, we examined the effects of MBIC
monotherapy or combination therapy in established
human breast tumor xenografts in the BALB/c nude
mice. The results provide preclinical evidence that MBIC
has potential therapeutic applications in the treatment of
aggressive and non-aggressive breast cancer subtypes.

dynamically monitored changes in cell attachment,
proliferation and death. Real Time Cell Analysis (RTCA)
assay was performed on MCF-7 cells as shown in
Figure 1B. In control and DMSO treated cells, a noticeable
constant increase in cell growth can be seen, as reflected
by increase in the cell index (CI) values. In MCF-7 cells,
treatment with MBIC at > 0.7 µM resulted in significant
inhibition of cell growth, while at 0.3 µM the cell growth
was not inhibited significantly. After applying 20 and
40 µM of MBIC to MDA-MB-231 cells, a slow inhibition
occurred. Cells treated at 80 µM showed a sudden decrease
of cell growth, while, at concentration of 10 µM, the
MBIC was not toxic to MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 1B).
The time-dependent experiment was performed for about
90 h post administration of MBIC. MDA-MB-231 cells
showed a higher resistance to MBIC compared to MCF-7
cells in both dose- and time-dependent manners.

RESULTS

MBIC induces mitochondrial-caspase-dependent
apoptosis

MBIC is cytotoxic to breast cancer cells
Cytotoxic effects of MBIC in three chemotherapyresponsive breast cancer cell-lines, MCF-7 (nonaggressive), T47D and MDA-MB-468 (lowly metastatic)
[16], intermediate chemotherapy-responsive breast cancer
cell-line, MDA-MB-231 (aggressive and highly metastatic)
[16] and two normal fibroblast cell-lines, NIH/3T3 and
L-cells were assessed by MTT assay. Results showed
that IC50 of MBIC was 0.73 ± 0.0 μM against MCF-7
cells, 1.3 ± 0.1 μM against T47D cells, 12.0  ±  0.3  μM
against MDA-MB-468 cells and 20.4 ± 0.2 μM against
MDA-MB-231 cells at 24 h. While, IC50 of MBIC-treated
NIH/3T3 and L-cells were 55.0 ± 0.1 μM and 59.6 ± 2.5
μM respectively (Table 1). Among selected breast cancer
cell-lines, MBIC treatment showed highest toxicity against
MCF-7 cells and lowest toxicity against MDA-MB-231
cells. In fact, MDA-MB-231 emulated by over 27-fold
more resistance to MBIC. Due to the wide variation in
the IC50 range, their different p53 status [17] and their
different metastatic status [16], MCF-7 and MDAMB-231 were studied further to identify the underlying
molecular mechanism of MBIC. Moreover, the mechanism
of resistance of MDA-MB-231 cells was investigated in
this study. Further cell viability was measured at 48 h
(Table 1). In addition we compared cytotoxic effects of
MBIC with a number of conventional anti-cancer drugs,
namely, colchicine, nocodazole, paclitaxel, doxorubicin
and tamoxifen (Table 1). Figure 1A shows inhibitory effect
of MBIC, tamoxifen, doxorubicin, colchicine, nocodazole
and paclitaxel against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells
proliferation at 24 and 48 h after treatment.

Annexin V assay was performed to determine
whether MBIC-treated breast cancer cells undergo cell
apoptosis. As shown in Figure 2A MBIC treatment of
MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in a higher
population of early apoptotic cells (19.0 ± 2.7% to
9.2 ± 3.8% of MCF-7; 10.4 ± 3.5% to 15.5 ± 2.8% of
MDA-MB-231) 24 h after treatment compared to the
control (0.0 ± 0.1% of MCF-7; 2.4 ± 0.5% of MDAMB-231). Late apoptosis was observed in both cell-lines
(72.5 ± 4.2% to 84.8 ± 2.3% of MCF-7; 45.4 ± 5.2%
to 71.6 ± 3.7% of MDA-MB-231) 24 h after MBIC
treatment. Our results showed that, MBIC induces
apoptotic type of programmed cell death in both breast
cancer cell-lines.
To investigate the contribution of pro-apoptotic
protein Bax and caspases to the apoptosis, we performed
Western blot analysis. As shown in Figure 2B, MBIC
induced the cleavage of caspases and elevated the protein
level of Bax in both cell-lines. However, activation of
caspases in MCF-7 cells is detectable at IC50 dosage,
unlike in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 2B). Figure 2C
shows relative intensities of mitotic proteins in a bar graph.
After evaluating apoptotic protein levels, mitochondrialdependent apoptotic features were assessed in MBIC
treated cells. MCF-7 cells treated with MBIC after 24 h
showed loss of cell population, escalated membrane
permeability, and collapsed mitochondrial membrane
potential (MMP) compared to control cells (Figure 3).
The nucleus in control cells remained in a uniform
rounded compact form and size. Permeability dye (green)
demonstrated a unified and unbroken plasma membrane.
MMP dye (red) was consistently detected in the cytosol,
indicating mitochondrial damage in MBIC-treated cells
compared to healthy untreated cells. Release of cytochrome
c from mitochondria into cytosol was observed (cyan) in

Human breast cancer cell-lines MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, T47D and MDA-MB-468, mouse fibroblast cell-lines NIH/3T3 and L-cells were treated with DMSO as vehicle control,
MBIC, colchicine, nocodazole, paclitaxel, doxorubicin and tamoxifen for 24 and 48 h. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay and by calculation of half maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC50). Data were mean ± SD of three independent experiments. (P < 0.05). Selectivity Index (SI) is calculated by dividing IC50 of non-cancer cell-line (L-cells)
against IC50 of human cancer cell-lines.

MBIC interrupts cytoskeleton components

MBIC-treated cells but not in untreated cells. In the case of
MBIC-treated MDA-MB-231 cells, the average fluorescent
intensity of membrane permeability, MMP and cytochrome
c release were less than the average fluorescent intensity
of these characteristics in MBIC-treated MCF-7 cells,
especially in low dosage of MBIC (0.7 µM in MCF-7;
20 μM in MDA-MB-231) (Supplementary Figure 2).

Following the appearance of a third peak in cell
cycle detection 48 h post MBIC application, β-tubulin
defects were monitored to evaluate cytoskeletal
rearrangement. After 48 h of incubation with MBIC,
MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells displayed size change,
morphological deformation and loss of cell-cell contact
sites. Interestingly, the main difference between the two
cell-lines appeared to be at IC50 dosage of MBIC, as at 0.7
µM of MBIC, MCF-7 cells showed abnormal chromosome
segregation and aberrant spindle assembly formation.
While at 20 µM of MBIC, MDA-MB-231 cells contained
random dispersed and condensed nuclear material
throughout the cytoplasm forming multi-nucleated large
cells. In contrast to the control cells that contained precise
and organized microtubules (Figure 4B). Supplementary
Figure 1B shows the cytoskeleton rearrangement at 24 h
post MBIC treatment with almost the same morphology as
48 h post MBIC treatment.

MBIC arrests cell cycle at G2-M phase
To evaluate the effect of MBIC on the cell cycle
arrest, the DNA content of both cell-lines was analyzed by
flow cytometer. The first peak represents the DNA content
of cells that are arrested in the G0-G1 phase and the second
peak represents the DNA content of the cells accumulated
in the G2-M phase [18], while the rise of third peak is a
sign of mitotic exit or mitotic slippage [11].
In both breast cancer cell-lines, treatment with
different dosages of MBIC showed G2-M phase arrest
after 24 h which represents the population of arrested
cells at mitosis (Supplementary Figure 1A). Interestingly,
48 h after treatment with MBIC, MDA-MB-231 cells
revealed the emergence of a third peak which represents
accumulation of cells that escaped mitosis through mitotic
slippage and were arrested in a pseudo G1/tetraploid
state (> 57%). In contrast, MCF-7 cells 48 h after MBIC
treatment still showed a higher G2-M phase arrested
population (44.1 ± 7.3% to 82.5 ± 2.5%), compared to
11.1 ± 3.7% in untreated cells (Figure 4A).

MBIC induces mitotic arrest and mitotic
slippage
To identify the underlying molecular mechanism of
mitotic arrest and mitotic slippage, the signaling pathway
involved in the G2-M cell cycle was investigated by
Western blot analysis. In this study, facilitative role of Cdk1

and cyclin B1 in cell cycle progression at G2-M [19] and
survivin’s dual role as mitotic effector and apoptosis inhibitor
[13], positioned these three proteins in the front line for
investigation. In the present study, up-regulation of cyclin B1
was observed in MCF-7 cells after MBIC application, while
MDA-MB-231 cells showed down-regulation of cyclin B1.
Previously, down-regulation of Cdk1 and survivin was
reported to manifest the existence of functional p53 [14, 20].
In the present study, down-regulation of Cdk1 and survivin
was observed in MCF-7 cells after MBIC application. While,
in MDA-MB-231 cells Cdk1 was stable and survivin was upregulated, which manifested the existence of dysfunctional
p53 [12] (Figure 4C). Figure 4D shows relative intensities of
mitotic proteins in a bar graph.

To verify Western blot results, a CoImmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay was performed to
visualize p-survivin and caspases complex formation. As
shown in Figure 5B in MCF-7 cells, along with increase
of MBIC dosage, decrease of p-survivin was observed
in parallel with a decrease of p-survivin-caspases-7/9
complex. In MDA-MB-231 cells, along with increase
of MBIC dosage, there was an increase of p-survivin.
This was in parallel with a stable level of p-survivincaspases-3/7/9 complex at 20 and 40 μM of MBIC and
in untreated cells. Finally at 80 μM of MBIC, p-survivin
is no longer coupled to caspases. Figure 5C shows dual
quantification of p-survivin and caspases-3/7/9 protein
intensities in complex formation.

MBIC alters survivin affinity for caspases

Gene silencing sensitizes MDA-MB-231 cell-line
to MBIC

Phosphorylation of survivin at Thr34 residue avoids
the activation of caspases and the initiation of caspasedependent apoptosis [15]. In Figures 4C and 2B, while
p-survivin level decreased, caspases-7/9 were activated in
MBIC-treated MCF-7 cells. In contrast, while p-survivin
level increased in MDA-MB-231 cells, caspases-3/7/9
were only activated in higher dosages of MBIC (40 μM
for Caspase-3 and 80 μM for Caspases-7/9). These results
suggest p-survivin and caspase status are associated and
their association correlates with p53 status. To comprehend
this molecular mechanism, Figure 5A illustrates the
association between p53 status, survivin and caspases.

In order to elucidate the role of p53 in the anticancer actions of MBIC, MCF-7 cells were transfected
with p53 siRNA. Silencing p53 increased the IC50
of MBIC in the MCF-7 cells to 2.7 ± 0.5 μM which
represents almost four times less sensitivity to MBIC
compared to non-transfected MCF-7 cells. Similarly,
survivin was silenced in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
cell-lines. In MBIC-treated MCF-7 cells, silencing of
survivin was without significant change in IC50 (0.82 ±
0.0 μM). However, in survivin siRNA transfected MDAMB-231 cells, there was a significant decrease of IC50

(from 20.4 ± 0.2 μM in non-transfected MDA-MB-231 to
4.4 ± 0.3 μM in siRNA transfected MDA-MB-231). These
results suggest that survivin is involved in MDA-MB-231
resistance to MBIC (Figure 6A and 6B).
Further, Western blot analysis was carried out in
survivin siRNA transfected MDA-MB-231 cells. Results
showed caspases-3/7/9 are activated in the absence of
survivin post MBIC application (Figure 6C). Additionally,
cell cycle analysis was performed in survivin siRNA
transfected MDA-MB-231 cells. Results showed the
absence of mitotic slippage 48 h after the treatment of
MBIC (Figure 6D).

reduced the mean MDA-MDB-231 tumor weight to 41.1
± 6.0 mg. However, following the combined treatment
of MBIC and doxorubicin, the tumor weight in the nude
mice was further reduced to 26.3 ± 5.0 mg (Figure 7C).
In line with the changes in tumor weight, we observed a
significant reduction (p < 0.05) in the tumor volume in
mice treated with a combined treatment of MBIC and
doxorubicin (161.2 ± 4.1 mm3) compared to either MBIC
alone (373.4 ± 167.0 mm3) or doxorubicin alone (266.6 ±
11.2 mm3). The mean tumor volume of untreated MDAMDB-231 tumor-bearing group was 1846.6 ± 257.1 mm3.
Figure 8A shows the tumor reduction between four groups
of treatment during 40 days of in vivo study. Figure 8B
shows tumor volume reduction between four groups of
treatment in the last day of in vivo study after obtaining
the tumors. The present result showed that MBIC actively
reduced the tumor volume and weight in MDA-MB-231
cells inoculated xenograft mice, also the anti-tumor effect
is even increased when given in combination with the
doxorubicin.

MBIC reduces the tumor volume in xenograft mice
The in vivo anti-tumor effects of MBIC alone and
in combination with doxorubicin were evaluated against
MDA-MB-231 cells inoculated in BALB/c nude mice. In
the present study no severe signs of toxicity were observed,
and similarly there was no gross reduction in body weight
(Figure 7A). Figure 7B showed the macroscopic analysis of
tumor size in untreated and treated groups of mice. MBIC
reduced the tumor weight significantly (P < 0.05) with the
mean tumor weight of 74.0 ± 47.0 mg compared to the
untreated tumor-bearing group with mean tumor weight of
240.2 ± 36.1 mg (Figure 7C). Doxorubicin treatment alone

agent and continue to proliferate. The limited success of
MTAs has led to further investigation and development
of more potent and selective drugs [21]. A preliminary
report showed that MBIC is cytotoxic to several cancer
including breast cancer cells [22]. MBIC exhibits higher
toxicity against human cancer and relatively low toxicity
against normal cell-lines (IC50 > 50 µM), Therefore it
is a potential candidate for cancer therapy [23]. In the
present study, we evaluated the molecular mechanism
of the anti-cancer actions of MBIC against highly
aggressive/metastatic and non-aggressive human breast
cancer cells. MBIC inhibited cell proliferation with IC50
of 0.73 ± 0.0 μM and 20.4 ± 0.2 μM in MCF-7 and MDAMB-231 cell-lines respectively. MBIC demonstrated
relatively low toxicity against two non-tumorigenic celllines, NIH/3T3 and L-cells with IC50 of 55.0 ± 0.1 μM
and 59.6 ± 2.5 μM respectively. The possible reason
for greater selectivity of MBIC towards cancer cells
compared to normal cells, could be that MBIC interferes
with mitotic progression by disrupting the microtubule
polymerization. Cancer cells undergo mitosis at a
significant increased rate compared to normal cells. This
characteristic makes the cancer cells more susceptible to
MTAs [24] such as MBIC.

Interruption of microtubule dynamics by MTAs
subsequently causes disruption of microtubule-kinetochore
binding. Weakly attached or unattached kinetochores
send signals to mitotic checkpoint proteins, and in
response mitosis is arrested [25]. In the present study,
MBIC induced mitotic arrest and mitochondrial mediated
apoptosis in both breast cancer cell-lines. Cell cycle
analysis showed both breast cancer cell-lines were arrested
in G2-M phase 24 h after MBIC treatment. However 48 h
after treatment, MDA-MB-231 cells showed presence of a
third peak (a pseudo-G1) [26]. Pseudo-G1 state is described
as representative of mitotic slippage wherein cells escape
a prolonged mitotic arrest, fail cytokinesis and enter into
the next G1 state of the cell cycle and become tetraploid
while still are exposed to MTA [26]. Exit from mitosis
requires cyclin B1 degradation by Cdk1, and in case of
microtubule disruption, mitotic checkpoints prevent
cyclin B1 degradation until entire microtubule-kinetochore
connection errors are corrected [27]. However, when
microtubule disruption is massive and mitotic checkpoints
are not capable of correcting microtubule-kinetochore
errors, the cell will then exit mitosis via mitotic slippage by
degrading cyclin B1, which is reported to be degraded by
many of MTAs [28]. In contrast, cyclin B1 accumulation

is generally thought to represent mitotic arrest [29]. In the
present study, cyclin B1 was degraded in MBIC-treated
MDA-MB-231 cells thereby indicating that cells exited
mitosis. In contrast, cyclin B1 was up-regulated in MBICtreated MCF-7 cells indicating mitotic arrest.
To explain the different sensitivities of MCF-7 and
MDA-MB-231 cell-lines towards MBIC, we evaluated the
levels of several key proteins. In general, cancer cells with
mutated p53 such as MDA-MB-231 cells are reported to
display resistance to several MTAs [12, 30]. Survivin is
a bi-functional protein that inhibits apoptosis based on
inhibitory effect on caspases, and regulates formation of
the mitotic spindle during the G2-M phase [13]. Loss of
wild-type p53 reinforces the up-regulation of survivin in
breast cancer, and increase of wild-type p53 suppresses
survivin [31, 32]. MBIC dose-dependently decreased
the protein level of survivin and increased the protein
level of p53 in MCF-7 cells. This finding indicates that
p53 is wild-type and remains functional in MCF-7 cells.
In MBIC-treated MDA-MB-231 cells MBIC increased

protein level of survivin but decreased the protein level of
p53. This is related to non-functionality of mutated p53 in
this cell-line. In addition, wild-type p53 suppresses Cdk1
expression in the G2-M phase and Cdk1 is required for the
apoptosis inhibitory role of survivin [33]. In the present
study, due to the functional p53, treatment with MBIC
decreased the protein level of Cdk1 in MCF-7 cells. In
contrast, treatment with MBIC did not affect Cdk1 protein
level in the MDA-MB-231 cells and this may be attributed
to the dysfunctionality of mutated p53 [33, 34]. On the
basis of present data, we can conclude that the reason for
mitotic slippage in MDA-MB-231 cells is degradation
of cyclin B1 and/or lack of p53 proper function in Cdk1
and survivin regulation. To investigate whether p53 and
its downstream proteins contribute to the appearance
of mitotic slippage, p53 gene was silenced in MCF-7
cells. The results showed an increase of IC50 (3.6-fold),
confirming the role of p53 in maintaining sensitivity of
MCF-7 cells to MBIC. Next, we silenced the survivin
gene in both cell-lines. Significant change was observed

in IC50 of MDA-MB-231 cells with a 4.5-fold reduction,
which confirms that survivin is a causative factor for
MDA-MB-231 sensitivity/resistance to MBIC.
Since it was not clear how survivin correlated with
observed apoptosis, the association between survivin
and caspases was analyzed. Cdk1-cyclin B1 complex
phosphorylates survivin at the Thr34 residue on the mitotic
apparatus. In vitro and in vivo studies showed loss of
Thr34 phosphorylation results in dissociation of survivin
from caspases-3/7/9, activation of caspases and initiation
of caspase-dependent apoptosis [15]. In the present study,
increased caspases activation coincided with decrease
of p-survivin in MBIC-treated MCF-7 cells, while in the
contrary, lack of caspase activation coincided with increased
level of p-survivin in MBIC-treated MDA-MB-231 cells,
except for higher dosage of MBIC in MDA-MB-231
cells. This finding demonstrates a reverse-connection
between p-survivin level and caspases activation. Confocal
microscopy result confirmed mitochondrial-caspasesdependent apoptosis was initiated in MCF-7 cells at IC50

dosage and higher, while it was initiated in MDA-MB-231
cells only at high dosage of MBIC. Co-IP assay demonstrated
that MBIC is likely to elicit gain-of-affinity of survivin for
caspases-3/7/9 in both cell-lines, but with different variations.
After silencing survivin in MBIC-treated MDA-MB-231
cell-line, Western blot analysis result revealed activation
of caspases-3/7/9, and cell cycle analysis revealed lack of
mitotic slippage. Of note, in the present study the MCF-7
cell-line evidently lacks caspase-3. MCF-7 cell-line obtained
from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) has been
reported not to express caspase-3 [35], followed by offering
the suggestion that in such cells, caspase-7 may compensate
for the loss of caspase-3 in apoptosis induction [36, 35].
In addition to MBIC-induced mitotic arrest in MCF-7
cells, the actions of MBIC also involved mitochondrialcaspase-dependent apoptosis. Consistent with the notion
that apoptosis was detected in MDA-MB-231 cells, while
caspases were not activated at 20 and 40 μM of MBIC, cells
possibly experienced apoptosis in a caspase-independent
pathway [37].

Figure 5: (A) Illustration of p53 status and its downstream effect in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells post MBIC treatment: Functional

wild-type p53 in MCF-7 cells suppresses survivin and Cdk1 protein levels after MBIC application. Low protein level of Cdk1 causes lack
of phosphorylated survivin. Low protein level of survivin and p-survivin causes release and activation of caspases in cytoplasm which leads
to apoptosis (at IC50 dosage of MBIC and higher). In contrast, dysfunctional mutated p53 in MDA-MB-231 cells, is not capable of inhibiting
survivin and Cdk1 proteins after MBIC application. Therefore, there are plenty of survivin in the cell to be phosphorylated and there are
enough Cdk1 to phosphorylate the survivin in Thr34 region. Thus, phosphorylated survivin binds to caspases and inhibits their activation
(at dosage above 40 μM). (B) MBIC alters affinity of survivin for caspases in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell-lines with different variations:
MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were treated with MBIC dose-dependently. Complex formation of p-survivin with caspases-3/7/9 was
detected while performing Co-IP assay followed by Western blot analysis. (C) Bar graph represents dual quantification of p-survivin
and caspases-3/7/9 protein intensities in complex formation which are normalized with β-actin. Data were results of three independent
experiments with mean ± SD. All the treatment groups were compared with control.”*” indicates statistically significant at P < 0.05.

In agreement with the in vitro findings, MBIC
administration inhibited the growth of MDA-MB-231
xenografts in the nude mice. The purpose of using
chemotherapeutic drugs in new combination therapies is to
improve the chance of adverse effects reduction at minimal
doses [40]. Doxorubicin, a DNA-damaging agent (DDA),
is one of the first-line chemotherapeutic drugs for breast
cancer treatment despite reports of severe side effects [38].
Since MTAs interfere with the translocation of DNA repair
proteins from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, thus in MTA
and DDA combination therapy, DNA has less chance to be
repaired. This synergism between MTA and DDA explains
why combination of MTA and DDA are frequently
successful in cancer therapy [39]. In present study, we
observed a significant (p < 0.05) 79.7 % and 91.2%
reduction of tumor volume compared to the untreated
group, after MBIC monotherapy and MBIC-doxorubicin
combination therapy respectively. Successful synergistic
reduction of tumor volume in combination therapy with
39.5 % reduction in comparison with the doxorubicin-

treated group, and with 56.8 % reduction in comparison
with the MBIC-treated group, was significantly (p < 0.05)
greater than the inhibitory effect of doxorubicin and MBIC
alone (Figure 8B). There was no adverse effect on body
weight following treatment with MBIC in a monotherapy
or in combination with doxorubicin (Figure 7A). The data
suggest that MBIC constitutively is likely to be beneficial
in the clinical settings either as a monotherapy or in
combination with conventional chemotherapeutic agents.

CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion MBIC, besides perturbing the
microtubule assembly, altered mitotic checkpoint proteins.
MBIC is more effective in the MCF-7 cell-line, with
functionally intact wild-type p53 compared to the MDAMB-231 cell-line. MDA-MB-231 cells contain defective
mutated p53 which is not capable of restoring its normal
function in negatively controlling survivin. This may
explain the decreased sensitivity of MDA-MB-231 cells

Figure 6: Survivin gene silencing increases the sensitivity of MDA-MB-231 to MBIC. (A) Cells were transfected with

different concentrations of p53 and survivin siRNA, mock-transfection control (Mock-TF) or not transfected control (Non-TF). Western
blot analysis was carried out to identify the effective concentration of each siRNA. P53 siRNA at concentration of 26.6 nM succeeded
to silence p53 in MCF-7 cells. Survivin siRNA at concentration of 100 nM succeeded to silence survivin in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7
cells. β-actin served as a loading control. (B) IC50 of both cell-lines after silencing p53 and survivin. (C) Western blot analysis was carried

Apoptosis detection assay

Each experiment was done in triplicate.

MBIC-induced apoptosis was detected by dual
staining Propidium Iodide (PI) and FITC-conjugated
Annexin V using Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit
(BD Pharmingen). This was followed by flow cytometry
analysis using Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting
(FACS) (BD Biosciences, CA, USA) as described
previously [10]. Data acquisition of 10,000 events/sample
was carried out. Annexin V single positive represented
the cells in early apoptotic stage, while cells with both
Annexin V and PI positive represented the cells in the last
stage of apoptosis, and PI single positive cells represented
necrotic. Each experiment was performed in triplicate.

Real-time cell analysis assay
Cytotoxic effect of MBIC was monitored in a
time-dependent manner by using xCELLigence RTCA
system (Roche, Manheim, Germany). 50 µl/well of
cell-free completed medium was added in 96-well goldmicroelectrode array (E-plate) to perform background
measurements. 5 × 103 cell/well were seeded and
incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The E-plate
was incubated in an E-plate 96 RTCA SP station at
37°C in 5 % CO2 incubator overnight. Cell adherence,
proliferation and spreading were recorded every 5 min and
the cell sensor impedance was displayed as an arbitrary
unit called normalized Cell Index (nCI). When the cells

Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay

24 h, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and
stained using Cellomics Multiparameter Cytotoxicity 3 Kit
(#8408102) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. This
kit includes dyes that represent morphological changes in
the nucleus (blue at 405 nm; channel 1), cell membrane
permeability (green at 488 nm; channel 2), MMP (red at
543 nm; channel 3) and release of cytochrome c (cyan
at 633 nm; channel 4). Cells were incubated with rabbit
anti-mouse DyLight 649-conjugated secondary antibody
and Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). All
confocal fluorescence images were acquired using LAS
AF software, version 2.6.0.7266 in Leica TCS SP5 II
confocal system (Mannheim, Germany) with a HCX PL
APO LAMBDA BLUE 40 ×/1.25 oil objective. Data were
processed using LAS X software, version 3.0.0. Each
experiment was performed in triplicate.

Co-IP assay is designed to isolate a protein (bait)
along with another protein (prey) to visualize that the bait
protein is coupled to prey protein in a complex formation.
Pierce Co-Immunoprecipitation Kit (Cat#26149, Pierce;
Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL) was used
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 500 µg of lysate
was pre-cleared using control agarose resin to minimize
non-specific binding. The lysates were then added into
columns that contain 10–75 µg immobilized bait protein
antibodies (p-survivin) linked to an amine-active resin and
incubated overnight at 4°C. The Co-IP was then eluted and
analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Caspases-3/7/9 (prey proteins)
were applied as primary antibody separately.

Gene knockdown by transfection of siRNA

Cell cycle analysis assay

For gene knockdown, Signal Silence® p53 siRNA II
(#6562) and Signal Silence® survivin siRNA II (#65546)
(Cell Signaling Technology (CST), USA) were used.
The MCF-7 cells were seeded at a concentration of
5 × 104 cells/well 24 h prior to transfection in RPMI1640 complete medium in three different 6-well plates (to
optimize three different siRNA/Mock-transfected control
concentrations). After 24 h the medium was discarded and
cells were washed. Further, FBS free media with 5% pen/
strep was applied. Three transfection complex (resulting
in final concentrations of p53 siRNA/Mock-transfected
control: 5 nM, 10 nM, 26.6 nM per well) were prepared.
The cells were treated with 100 μl of transfection complex
and incubated for 48 h. However, 24 h after transfection
half of the free media was removed and an equal volume
of the complete media was added. Cells were then washed
and lysed using RIPA buffer supplemented with 10 µl
protease inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate and PMSF (Santa
Cruz Biotech, USA). Further, the samples were evaluated
for their silenced p53 gene by Western blot analysis.
Additionally, survivin was silenced in both MCF-7 and
MDA-MB-231 cell-lines. Three transfection complexes
(resulting in final concentrations of survivin siRNA/Mocktransfected control: 25 nM, 50 nM, 100 nM per well) were
prepared. Both gene silencing assays were comprised of
mock-transfected control siRNA as a positive control.
Non-transfected control cells were incubated in parallel.

For the analysis of cell cycle, cells were prepared
as described previously [10]. The cells were then treated
at different concentration of MBIC for 24 and 48 h. Later,
cells were incubated with PI for 30 min. The cells were
then collected and prepared for flow cytometry analysis as
described previously [10]. The percentage of cells arrested
in G0-G1, S and G2-M were obtained using FACS flow
cytometry. Each experiment was performed in triplicate.

Immunofluorescence detection assay
(cytoskeletal rearrangement)
The effect of MBIC on one of the microtubule
component (β-tubulin) was examined by using Thermo
Scientific Cellomics Cytoskeletal rearrangement kit
(#8402402). 1 × 104 cells/well were seeded in 96-well
plate and treated with IC50 concentration of MBIC for 24
and 48 h. Treated cells were stained to detect β-tubulin
and nucleus. Images were acquired and analyzed using
ArrayScan High Content Screening (HCS) system
(Thermo Scientific, USA) with 20 × objective. Each
experiment was done in triplicate.

Western blot analysis
Cells were treated with MBIC in a dose-dependent
manner for 24 h. Cells were harvested, lysed and applied
for Western blot analysis as described previously [10].
The primary antibodies that were used in this study
included: anti-p53, anti-survivin, anti-phospho-survivin
(anti-p-survivin), anti-Cdk1, anti-cyclin B1, anti-Bax,
anti-caspase-3, anti-caspase-7, anti-caspase-9 (1:1000)
(Cell Signaling Technology, USA) and mouse antiβ-actin (1:40000) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA) antibodies. Western blot images were quantified
and processed by ImageJ software (NIH, USA). Each

To monitor mammary tumor growth, the diameters
of the tumors were measured horizontally and vertically.
Treatment began when tumors reached an average size
of 200 to 300 mm3 and this model was considered as an
established growing xenograft model. Tumor-bearing
mice were divided into the following four groups (3 mice
per group): group 1 DMSO-treated (as control group),
group 2 MBIC-treated (25 mg/kg in 1x sterile PBS [40]),
group 3 doxorubicin-treated (1.5 mg/kg [41]) and group
4 combination of MBIC-doxorubicin-treated (25 mg/kg
of MBIC; 1.5 mg/kg of doxorubicin). Treatments were
given intraperitoneally every 2 days. Treatments were
conducted for 30 days to compare the treatment effects
in different groups. Body weight changes and tumor sizes
were recorded at regular intervals. Tumor volumes were
calculated by the following formula: ½ (Width × Length2).
The in vivo experiments were finalized 40 days after
MDA-MB-231 cells injection by overdose of ketaminexylazine and tumors were collected for further analysis.
