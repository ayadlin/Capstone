ABSTRACT
In this study, we tested whether a standardized epigallocatechin-3-gallate
(EGCG) rich green tea extract (comprising > 90% EGCG) affects fitness and lifespan
as well as parameters of glucose metabolism and energy homeostasis in the fruit
fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Following the application of the green tea extract
a significant increase in the mean lifespan (+ 3.3 days) and the 50% survival
(+ 4.3 days) as well as improved fitness was detected. These effects went along
an increased expression of Spargel, the homolog of mammalian PGC1α, which has
been reported to affect lifespan in flies. Intriguingly, in flies, treatment with the
green tea extract decreased glucose concentrations, which were accompanied by an
inhibition of α-amylase and α-glucosidase activity. Computational docking analysis
proved the potential of EGCG to dock into the substrate binding pocket of α-amylase
and to a greater extent into α-glucosidase. Furthermore, we demonstrate that EGCG
downregulates insulin-like peptide 5 and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase,
major regulators of glucose metabolism, as well as the Drosophila homolog of leptin,
unpaired 2. We propose that a decrease in glucose metabolism in connection with an
upregulated expression of Spargel contribute to the better fitness and the extended
lifespan in EGCG-treated flies.

species [9–13]. However, the underlying cellular and
molecular mechanisms are not clear. Bartholome and
colleagues observed higher levels of the FoxO ortholog
DAF-16, which increased the expression of its target gene
Sod-3, and extended lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans
[14]. In Drosophila melanogaster, EGCG extended lifespan
via an induction of endogenous antioxidant enzymes [12].
Additionally, in mice receiving tea polyphenols from the
13th month of life onward, lifespan was significantly
longer than in the corresponding control animals [9].
Furthermore, rats treated with EGCG also exhibited a
significantly longer lifespan that was accompanied by a
decrease in inflammation and oxidative stress as well as an
increase of FOXO3a and SIRT1, both centrally involved in
the regulation of longevity [10]. It has been demonstrated

INTRODUCTION
The consumption of green tea (Camellia sinensis)
has been associated with various health benefits [1–4].
The leaves of green tea offer a wide spectrum of different
phytochemicals that may vary according to environmental
conditions and processing procedures. Approximately
30% of the green tea dry weight comes from polyphenols
of which 60–80% are catechins [5]. Catechins and in
particular epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which
accounts for up to 80% of the catechins, are suggested to
mediate the health-promoting effects of green tea [6–8].
In fact, studies in various model organisms indicate a
lifespan extension by green tea and EGCG treatment. This
has been shown in both invertebrates and in mammalian

that aging is associated with a decrease in mitochondrial
biogenesis and in consequence with a loss in the expression
of PPARγ co-activator α (PGC1α), the master switch
of energy metabolism [15, 16]. Interestingly, green tea
polyphenols have been shown to induce both PGC1α
mRNA and protein expression in male Sprague-Dawley
rats [17].
The aim of the present study was to elucidate the
underlying mechanisms of the lifespan extending effect
of a caffeine-free green tea extract containing more than
90% EGCG in Drosophila melanogaster. We analyzed
the regulatory effects of EGCG on parameters involved in
energy homeostasis and glucose metabolism. In addition,
fitness, as marker for an improved health span, was
assessed.

α-amylase:EGCG complex produced steric clashes of the
inhibitor with EGCG in close proximity to the active site.

α-Glucosidase homology model preparation and
molecular docking of EGCG
Using the web-based SWISS-MODEL service
dedicated to protein structure homology modeling [29] a
α-glucosidase homology model was built. Blind docking
for EGCG with the homology model of α-glucosidase
was carried out using the web-based SwissDock service
[27]. Figure 3b illustrates the predicted binding mode of
EGCG plugging the entry of the substrate-binding cavity
of the α-glucosidase. The binding free energies of a cluster
of eight binding poses were averaged (−7.44 kcal/mol ±
SEM = 0.001 kcal/mol) to estimate the affinity from the
predicted binding intensities of the docking interaction of
EGCG at the entry of the binding pocket of α-glucosidase.

RESULTS
EGCG extends lifespan and improves fitness in
Drosophila melanogaster

EGCG affects the expression of biomarkers
related to energy homeostasis and energy
metabolism

The application of 10 mg/ml EGCG increased the
mean lifespan (+ 3.3 days) and the 50% survival (+ 4.3
days) compared to control flies (Figure 1a). Flies reared
on EGCG-supplemented medium for 30 days exhibited a
significantly higher fitness level in the climbing assay than
the control flies (Figure 1b).

Flies treated with EGCG for 10 days exhibited
higher levels of p-AMPK protein as depicted in Figure 4a.
Furthermore, flies housed on an EGCG-supplemented
diet showed significantly higher levels of spargel (srl)
mRNA expression than the corresponding control flies
(Figure 4b). Srl is the fly homolog of human PPARγco-activator 1α (PGC1α), the master regulator of energy
homeostasis. The mRNA expression of unpaired 2 (upd2),
the homolog of human leptin, was significantly lowered
in flies that had received EGCG for 10 days compared to
control animals (Figure 4c). In addition, the key enzyme
of gluconeogenesis, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase
(Pepck; Figure 4d), and insulin-like peptide 5 (Ilp5;
Figure  4e) were significantly downregulated following
EGCG-treatment for 10 days in comparison to flies
receiving CM. Furthermore, the expression of Ilp2,
Ilp3, and Ilp6 as well as the expression of the glucose
transporters Glut1, Glut3 and Glut4EF was not affected
by EGCG treatment (data not shown).

EGCG inhibits α-amylase and α-glucosidase
in vitro and in vivo and decreases glucose levels
in Drosophila melanogaster
EGCG dose-dependently inhibited both α-amylase
and α-glucosidase in vitro (Figure 2a, 2b). Accordingly,
flies reared for 10 days on the EGCG-supplemented
diet showed significantly lower levels of both amylase
(Figure  2c) and α-glucosidase activity (Figure 2d). As
shown in Figure 2e, glucose levels were lowered by 25%
following EGCG-treatment.

Molecular docking of EGCG on human salivary
α-amylase

DISCUSSION

In order to gain insight into the putative binding
mode of EGCG with human salivary α-amylase blind
docking for EGCG with the crystallographic model of
apo-amylase was carried out [27]. Figure 3a illustrates a
predicted binding mode of EGCG snugly fitting into the
left arm of the polysaccharide-binding cleft of human
salivary amylase. The binding free energies of a cluster
of eight binding poses were averaged (−7.29 kcal/mol ±
SEM = 0.056 kcal/mol) to estimate the affinity from the
predicted binding intensities of the docking interaction of
EGCG at the active site of human salivary α-amylase. The

In the present study we used Drosophila
melanogaster as a model organism in order to elucidate
the effect of EGCG on glucose metabolism, fitness
and lifespan. Drosophila melanogaster offers a wide
variety of advantages. This includes a short generation
time, a reasonable number of offspring and a relatively
short lifespan. Furthermore, it possesses defined organs
including gut, brain and fat body. Drosophila melanogaster
holds a complex and dynamic gut exhibiting a similar
structure and organization like the mammalian gut
predestining it as a feasible model organism in nutrition

research [32–35]. The application of the EGCG-rich
green tea extract significantly extended lifespan in male
flies. Similarly to our results indicating that EGCG only
extended the lifespan in male but not in female flies (data
not shown), Lopez and co-workers found that lifespan
is only extended in male but not in female Drosophila
melanogaster following EGCG application [13]. It has
also been shown that in male flies a lifelong intake of
10 mg/ml green tea catechin extract extended the mean
lifespan (59 ± 2.8 days) compared to the corresponding
control flies (51 ± 2.0 days) [12].
We identified EGCG as an inhibitor of α-amylase
and α-glucosidase, which may cause the attenuated
glucose levels in our flies as the expression levels of the
glucose transporters were not affected. We could also
show via computational docking studies that EGCG fits
into binding boxes of both α-amylase and α-glucosidase.
In the case of α-amylase the docking results indicate
competitive inhibition by EGCG through a single highaffinity binding site located close to the active center.
In contrary docking with α-glucosidase rather suggests
a noncompetitive inhibition mode with EGCG blocking
the entry of the deeply buried substrate-binding site. Our
results also demonstrate that the blocking effect of EGCG
is stronger with regard to α-glucosidase than α-amylase.
Interestingly, a recent study conducted by Harrison and
co-workers identified the α-amylase inhibitor acarbose as
a compound that extends lifespan in mice [36].
Tinkerhess and colleagues showed that, as in
mammals, endurance exercise caused an upregulation
of the PGC1α homolog srl in Drosophila melanogaster.
Interestingly, in mutant srl flies, the positive effect of
exercise is abolished whereas an overexpression of srl
in the muscle and the heart of the mutant flies improved
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

some exercise-related physiological parameters [37].
A 30 day application of the EGCG-rich tea extract to our
flies resulted in improved climbing activity that may be
related to the significant increase of the srl expression
and consequently to a potential increase in mitochondrial
biogenesis. These characteristics may also contribute to
the extension in lifespan. The weakness of the current
study is a missing experiment with srl mutant flies. Further
studies are needed to investigate the effects of EGCG on
srl mutants.
We were able to detect changes in the expression of
parameters involved in energy metabolism. With regard
to the insulin-like peptides (Ilps), Ilp5 was found to be
significantly downregulated by EGCG in our Drosophila
melanogaster. Min and co-workers also observed a
downregulation of Ilp5 mRNA levels following dietary
restriction [38, 39], and another group demonstrated
that yeast dietary restriction (DR) (in the fly medium
the percentage of yeast was decreased although the
percentage of carbohydrate remained constant) caused
a downregulation of both Ilp5 mRNA and protein levels
[38, 40]. At the same time, the glucose levels in our
EGCG-treated flies were significantly lower than in the
corresponding control flies, which may explain the extension
in lifespan by EGCG. Glucose has been described as a proaging factor that interferes with all relevant regulators of
the aging process [41, 42]. This has also been reported by
Schulz and co-workers who observed a decrease in lifespan
of Caenorhabditis elegans due to high glucose availability
while glucose restriction resulted in an extended lifespan
through an induction of the mitochondrial respiration
[43]. The downregulation of the rate-controlling enzyme
in gluconeogenesis, Pepck, may have also contributed to
the lower glucose levels in our EGCG-treated flies. This

result is in contrast to the fact that an increase in PGC1α is
related to an upregulation of gluconeogenesis including an
induction of Pepck [44]. Indeed, our results are supported
by two recent studies. Aatsinki and co-workers [45] showed
an upregulation of hepatic PGC1α and a simultaneous
impairment of hepatic Pepck by metformin treatment in
both human primary hepatocytes and mice. Metformin is
an anti-diabetic drug used clinically for decades and known
for its AMPK-inducing and lifespan extending effects
[46–49]. Doan et al. [50] treated mice with gallic acid (GA),
a natural polyphenol, and observed a significant induction
of AMPK activation accompanied by an increase in PGC1α
and a decrease in Pepck expression. In Caenorhabditis
elegans it has been shown that aak-2, a homolog of the
mammalian AMPK, is essentially required to extend
lifespan due to glucose restriction. Schulz and colleagues
suggest that the glucose restriction increases the levels of
reactive oxygen species resulting in an induction of the
endogenous antioxidant machinery consequently leading to
an improved stress resistance which the authors refer to as
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

“mitohormesis” [43]. The inhibition of gluconeogenesis in
the present study may be at least partly mediated through
an induction of AMPK by EGCG [51]. These results may
imply that an EGCG treatment mimics the effects of caloric
restriction (CR). To date, CR is the only established method
to extend health and lifespan in primates [52–54].
Our results indicate that EGCG significantly extended
lifespan in male flies, which was accompanied by improved
fitness. For the first time, we confirmed the inhibitory effect
of EGCG on α-amylase and α-glucosidase activity in vitro
and in vivo in Drosophila melanogaster. Computational
docking analysis proved the potential of EGCG to dock into
the substrate binding pocket of α-amylase and to a greater
extent into α-glucosidase. By lowering the activity of
these enzymes, EGCG causes a decrease in calorie uptake
resulting in lower levels of glucose and Ilp5. The lowered
energy intake also causes a significant downregulation of
the leptin homolog upd2. The inhibition of the rate-limiting
enzyme of gluconeogenesis, Pepck, is potentially mediated
through an activation of AMPK by EGCG, which also

causes the significant upregulation of srl, the master switch
of mitochondrial biogenesis. The postulated mechanism is
summarized in Figure 5.
Energy excess is the main cause of accelerated
aging [55]. Limiting calorie intake may counteract the
deleterious effects of aging [56]. We propose that EGCG
may function as a potential caloric restriction mimetic,
thereby affecting health and lifespan, which needs to be
confirmed in future in vivo studies in mammalian species.

In order to exclude differences in food intake as
reason for differing results between control flies and
tea polyphenol treated flies, the gustatory assay was
performed using the method of Bahadorani et al. [18].
Fifteen flies were either kept on control medium (CM;
5% sucrose, 8.6% corn meal, 5% inactive dry yeast, 0.5%
agar) or isocaloric CM supplemented with 10 mg/ml tea
polyphenols (EGCG; Teavigo, DSM, Basel, Switzerland).
They were reared under standard conditions (25°C, 60%
relative humidity, 12-h day/night cycle), and the medium
was changed at least 2 times during this period. After 5
days, flies were transferred onto CM or EGCG stained
with 0.2% sulforhodamine B sodium salt (Sigma-Aldrich,
Steinheim, Germany) and kept under standard conditions
for 15 h. Flies were anesthetized and sorted to an arbitrary
redness index of their abdomens (colorless = 0, partly
colored = 0.5, fully red colored = 1.0). The food intake did
not differ between control flies and EGCG-treated flies.

of α-glucosidase (gi|411229) from baker’s yeast and the
high resolution X-ray structure of isomaltase (PDB ID:

In vivo α-glucosidase and amylase activity assay
Flies were maintained either on CM (n = 39) or
EGCG (n = 39) under standard conditions for 10 days. Per
group, 13 male flies were homogenized in 250 μl Ca2+/
Mg2+-free PBS (Gibco, Darmstadt, Germany) using a
Qiagen TissueLyser II (Hilden, Germany). Homogenates
were centrifuged at 13,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min.
Supernatants were removed and used for enzyme activity
measurements.
The α-glucosidase activity assay (MAK123, SigmaAldrich, Steinheim, Germany) was performed according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The amylase activity assay (MAK009, SigmaAldrich, Steinheim, Germany) was conducted according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Enzyme activities were
related to the corresponding fly weights per fly.

RNA isolation and real time PCR
Total RNA was isolated from 5 flies per
sample using peqGOLD TriFast™ (Peqlab, Erlangen,
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
RNA concentration was determined by measuring
the absorbance with a NanoDrop® spectrophotometer
(Thermo Scientific, Langenselbold, Germany), and the
RNA purity was assessed by calculating the 260/280nm and 260/230-nm ratios. RNA aliquots were stored
at −80°C until the PCR was performed. The primers for
Drosophila melanogaster genes were designed using
Primer3 software and were synthesized and purchased
from MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany (see Table 1).
The real time PCR was performed using the SensiFast™
SYBR® No-ROX One-Step kit (Quantace, Berlin,
Germany) on a Rotor-Gene 6000 cycler (Corbett Life
Science, Sydney, Australia). The relative mRNA levels
of the target genes were calculated relative to the
expression of the housekeeping gene ribosomal protein
l32 (rpl32).

Docking analysis
X-ray structural models of human salivary
α-amylase (PDB ID: 1SMD [23]), isomaltase from
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (PDB ID: 3A4A [24]) and pig
pancreatic α-amylase (PDB ID: 1PPI [25]) were obtained
from the Protein Data Bank at Brookhaven. The EGCG
3D-structure was obtained from the Zinc database (EGCG:
Zinc ID 3870412) [26]. The human salivary α-amylase
structure was prepared for docking by removing from the
crystallographic structure ions and water molecules. Since
the salivary R-amylase X-ray structure does not contain
hydrogen atoms, H-atoms were added to the enzyme prior
to docking by the SwissDock web-service [27]. (The web
service SwissDock is based on fast docking using the
CHARMM force field with the docking software EADock

Statistics
Analysis of lifespan and stress test experiments was
performed with dLife (freeware, available from the laboratory
of Scott Pletcher, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor,
MI, USA). Survival was calculated using a Kaplan-Meier
approach, and significant differences were calculated applying
the log-rank test with the dLife program based on R. Mean and
median survival times were calculated with SPSS (Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences, IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).
All other data were analyzed for significant differences using a
one-way ANOVA followed by a Student’s t-test. All data were
tested for normality of distribution (Kolmogorov-Smirnov and
Shapiro-Wilk) and homogeneity of variances (Levene’s test).
P < 0.05 was considered significant. The data are expressed
as the mean ± SEM.
