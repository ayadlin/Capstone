ABSTRACT
Biseugenol (Eug) is known to antiproliferative of cancer cells; however, to date,
the antiperitoneal dissemination effects have not been studied in any mouse cancer
model. In this study, Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) expression was associated with
lymph node and distant metastasis in patients with gastric cancer and was correlated
with clinicolpathological pattern. We evaluated the antiperitoneal dissemination
potential of knockdown AhR and Biseugenol in cancer mouse model and assessed
mesenchymal characteristics. Our results demonstrate that tumor growth, peritoneal
dissemination and peritoneum or organ metastasis implanted MKN45 cells were
significantly decreased in shAhR and Biseugenol-treated mice and that endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress was caused. Biseugenol-exposure tumors showed acquired
epithelial features such as phosphorylation of E-cadherin, cytokeratin-18 and loss
mesenchymal signature Snail, but not vimentin regulation. Snail expression, through
AhR activation, is an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) determinant.
Moreover, Biseugenol enhanced Calpain-10 (Calp-10) and AhR interaction resulted
in Snail downregulation. The effect of shCalpain-10 in cancer cells was associated
with inactivation of AhR/Snail promoter binding activity. Inhibition of Calpain-10 in
gastric cancer cells by short hairpin RNA or pharmacological inhibitor was found to
effectively reduced growth ability and vessel density in vivo. Importantly, knockdown
of AhR completed abrogated peritoneal dissemination. Herein, Biseugenol targeting

ER stress provokes Calpain-10 activity, sequentially induces reversal of EMT and apoptosis
via AhR may involve the paralleling processes. Taken together, these data suggest that
Calpain-10 activation and AhR inhibition by Biseugenol impedes both gastric tumor growth
and peritoneal dissemination by inducing ER stress and inhibiting EMT.

INTRODUCTION

stress dampening peritoneal dissemination and inhibiting
of angiogenesis [2;5;21]. However, the role of AhR
on EMT and cellular and molecular mechanisms of the
development, progression, and peritoneal dissemination in
gastric cancer still remain to be clarified.
Biseugenol (4-allyl-2-methoxyphenol; Eug), one of
phenolic phytochemicals, is a biologically active phenolic
component of Syzigium aromaticum (cloves), which has
been shown to be a potential anticancer agent in multiple
facets of signal transduction and possess various biological
properties such as antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory,
etc [22;23]. World Health Organization (WHO) Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO) have admitted an
acceptable daily intake of Biseugenol of 2.5 mg/kg body
weight for humans [24]. Biseugenol has been considered
non-carcinogenic and non-mutagenic and announced as
safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Ghosh R et al. have shown that Biseugenol causes
melanoma growth suppression through inhibition of
E2F1 transcriptional activity [25]. Nangia-Makker P
and colleagues demonstrated that inhibits tumor growth
and angiogenesis in MDA-MB-231 cells [26]. Inhibitory
effects of Biseugenol on the activity and expression of
MMP-9 activity related to metastasis has also been found
by Nam H [27]. In addition, Biseugenol acts as a potent
inhibitor of NF-κB, prevention of lipopolysaccharidestimulated macrophages activation and inflammatory
cytokine expression [28]. We previous reported that
activating ER stress thwarts gastric tumor growth,
peritoneal dissemination through inducing apoptosis and
reversal EMT process [2;5;21;29]. The unfolded protein
response (UPR) is a cellular stress response related to
the endoplasmic reticulum stress, was shown to require
in nu/nu mice microvasculature for treating breast tumor
with ER stress- activator tunicamycin by Aditi Banerjee et
al. demonstrated [3]. However, the effects of Biseugenol
on ER stress correlated tumor growth and peritoneal
dissemination are still unclear. Herein, we hypothesize that
Biseugenol inhibits the EMT progression of gastric cancer
cells through a Calpain-10- interaction with AhR and
regulated Snail pathway. Taken together, these findings
suggest that the therapeutic activation of Calpain-10 by
Biseugenol-treated and further interaction with AhR
suppresses both gastric tumor growth and peritoneal
dissemination by inducing ER.

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is
a pivotal mechanism in embryonic development and
peritoneal dissemination [1;2]. Recently studies have
shown that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress can
directly exert an effect on cancer cells themselves, or
on endothelial cells, reducing tumor growth, metastasis,
and inducing cell cycle arrest, senescence, apoptosis [26]. Peritoneal dissemination is the most common cause
of metastasis from malignancies, such as gastric, colon,
ovarian, pancreatic cancer, and patients with this condition
are generally refractory to conventional therapeutic
approaches [7-10]. Yet, no effective therapy has been
established so far to alleviate this devastating and often
fatal end-stage condition. Therefore, there is an urgent
need to seek for novel therapy for suppresses cancer
peritoneal dissemination and mitigate suffering advanced
cancer patients.
Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) functions as a
ligand-activated basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor
regulating transcription encoding xenobiotic metabolizing
enzymes, which has been shown constitutively active AhR
induces stomach tumors [11;12]. Importantly, previous
studies have demonstrated that AhR participate in tumor
initiation, promotion and progression [13]. AhR exposure
to 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA), has recently
been shown to activate transcription of Slug, another
repressor of E-cadherin gene transcription, suggesting a
signaling mechanism may contribute to EMT in mammary
epithelial cell and MDCK cells [13-17]. Overexpressing
AhR in human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC)
exhibited enhanced motility, migration and invasion [18].
Paradoxically, there is substantial evidence that it may act
as a converse role. Staršíchová A et al. have shown that
tumorigenesis inducer transforming growth factor β-1
(TGF-β1), suppresses the AhR-mediated gene expression
through multiple mechanisms, involving inhibition of
AhR expression and down-regulation of nuclear AhR,
via a SMAD4-dependent pathway in prostate epithelial
cells [19]. Rico-Leo EM et al. demonstrated AhR(-/-)
keratinocytes and sh-AhR NMuMG cells derived from
normal mouse mammary epithelial cells had increased
migration, reduced levels of epithelial markers, and
increased expression of mesenchymal markers [20]. In
addition, basal or TGFβ-induced AhR down-modulation
could be relevant in the acquisition of a motile EMT
phenotype in both normal and transformed epithelial cells
[20]. Recently, our reports have shown that inducing ER

RESULTS
Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is upregulated
in gastric cancer tissues and gastric cancer cell
lines
To investigate a possible role for AhR in gastric
cancer progression, we performed immunohistochemical
analysis of 40 patient’s human gastric cancer specimens
and demonstrated increase in AhR expression, as
compared with benign tissue adjacent to the tumor (Figure
1A). After surveying benign tissue, typical moderately
differentiated adenocarcinoma (Figure 1B) and poorly
differentiated signet-ring cell carcinoma (Figure 1C)
make up the majority of tumors shown in gastric cancer
specimen. In the diffused-type gastric cancer tissues
(Figure.1D), adenocarcinoma with omentum metastasis
(Figure 1E), adenocarcinoma with lymph node and distant
metastasis (Figure 1F). The percentage of positive tumor
cells and the staining intensity for each sample were
recorded. The clinicopathological characteristics of the
gastric cancer patients are summarized in Table 1. The
high expression rate of the AhR was 67.5% (27/40) in

was found between the two groups. The level of AhR

Furthermore, protein level AhR expression different in
human stomach cancer epithelial cell line (AGS, MKN45,

In this study, we examined whether Biseugenol
could suppress gastric tumor growth, peritoneal
dissemination of gastric cancer along with major organ
metastasis. Actually, Monoeugenol treatment did
not induce the cell morphological changes and other

Biseugenol had no toxic effects and in fact induced modest
weight gains. Quantification of body weight (left panel)
and tumor weights (right panel) is shown in (Figure 2D).

A recent novel finding is that induction ER stress
can inhibit peritoneal dissemination [2-6]. Because of
the emerging role of ER stress induction as a therapeutic
modality, we investigated whether Biseugenol induced ER
stress using the Cignal ERSE Reporter Assay. As shown in
Figure 2E, exposure of gastric cancer cells to Biseugenol,
led to a 3-5.2 fold induction, as compared with control
cells, proving a critical clue that Biseugenol induces ER
stress in gastric cancer. Similar results were observed
with known inducers of ER stress tunicamycin and
thapsigargin. Combination Biseugenol and tunicamycin
did not have markedly synergistic effect in ERSE Reporter

We further examined whether Biseugenol enhances
the interaction of Calpain-10 with AhR. As shown in
Figure 5A, the interaction of Calpain-10 with AhR
determined by immunoprecipitation assay was modest
in the control cells, yet their interaction was significantly
enhanced and lasted 4-8 h in the presence of Biseugenol.
A comparison of 10% input displayed for protein
visualization was used as a positive control. In addition,
confocal microscopy detection revealed that exposure in
8 h efficiently enhances the co-localization of Calpain-10
with AhR in Biseugenol-treated SCM-1 cells (Figure
5B). In order to determine whether Calpain-10 cleaved
AhR, we digested concentrated AhR with recombinant
Calpain-10 under various conditions in vitro (Figure 5C).
Incubation of AhR with recombinant Calpain-10 for 1 h
at 30 °C led to the complete digestion of full-length AhR
as determined by in vitro cleavage assay. The cleaved
fragments depended on the presence of recombinant
Calpain-10. We also assessed transfected Calpain-10
siRNA knocks down the co-localization of endogenous
Calpain-10/AhR in Biseugenol-treated gastric cancer cells
(data not shown). These results indicated that Biseugenol
enhances Calpain-10/AhR interaction, leading to cleavage
of AhR.

To more directly assess the effect of Biseugenol
on organelle morphology, we utilized TEM proved ER
stress, straightforwardly. In Figure 3A, we demonstrated
there was ER dilation and swelling in Biseugenol-treated
cells, suggestive of ER stress. Next, we investigated the
correlation with molecular ER stress marker. We found
that Biseugenol induces the canonical ER stress markers
IRE1α, GADD153, p-elf2α in dose-dependent manner
and time-dependent effect. Noticeably, we observed a
significant increase in Calpain-10 expression, but not
calpain-1 or calpain-2 expression (Figure 3B-3C). Thus,
we evaluated the effect of Biseugenol on calpain activity.
As shown in Figure. 4A, Biseugenol increased calpain
activity in a time-dependent manner, which started to
increase at 30 min, and peaked at 60 min, and then was
sustained to 12 h, followed by a decrease at 24 h. Cells
remained adherent over the time course, with no loss of
viability.
To confirm Calpain-10 specific functions, we
further tested whether knockdown specific Calpain-10
activity could compromise the ability of Biseugenol on
activation function induction. As shown in Figure. 4B,
Biseugenol induced calpain activity in gastric cancer cells,
which could be reversed by calpain inhibitor (ALLN).
Importantly, using a siRNA to Calpain-10 activity led to
a significant abatement of Biseugenol-induced activity in
human gastric cancer cells after 1 h treatment. SiRNAcalpain-1 or calpain-2 did not affect Biseugenol-induced
activity. Therefore, Biseugenol is specific in its ability
to induce ER stress via atypical ER stress-Calpain-10
mechanism.
An important role of the AhR has been reported
consistent with gastric tumorigenesis and thus also in the
control of growth and proliferation of gastric epithelial
cells [12]. We previously demonstrated that in Figure2
that using a siRNA to knockdown AhR led to a markedly
inhibits metastasis in vivo. Next, we hypothesis that
Biseugenol-induces Calpain-10 activity regulates AhR
expression, resulting in inhibiting metastasis proceed
and peritoneal dissemination. As shown in Figure
4C, Biseugenol specifically decreased AhR in a dosedependent effect and time-dependent manner, but not
ARNT (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator
protein), that forms a complex with ligand-bound
AhR. Consistent with our hypothesis, pretreatment
calpain inhibitor significantly reversed AhR production.

Biseugenol inhibits EMT marker in vitro via AhR
down-regulation
Established as a tumor and metastasis suppressor,
E-cadherin expression is frequently down-regulated or
extinguished in malignancy which strongly correlates
with poor prognosis. Herein, the increasing of E-cadherin
is frequently considered to be a reducing the hallmark of
EMT and of a blocking migratory, invasive carcinoma.
However, the mechanisms underlying AhR on EMT
and peritoneal dissemination remained unknown. We
then examined whether AhR regulated mesenchymal
(metastatic) properties controlled by Biseugenol.
In addition, whether Biseugenol induced epithelial
cell signature and transcriptional regulation was also
determined. As shown in Figure 5D-5E, in confocal
microscope image, Biseugenol significantly downregulated
AhR, and phosphorylation of E-cadherin upregulated
and cytokeratin-18 expression (data not shown) but not
constitutive form of E-cadherin. Biseugenol-reduced
EMT-related marker and transcriptional repressor Snail
(Figure 6A) but not vimentin regulation was also found.

expression, DNA binding activity of the Snail promoter
was executed. As shown in Figure 6D, EMSA assay
demonstrated that Biseugenol suppresses AhR binding
activity on Snail promoter binding site in dose-dependent
and time course. Furthermore, we investigated whether
inhibition of Calpain-10 suppresses AhR cleavage and
located in Snail binding site. Our results shown that
treatment with calpain inhibitor or transfection with
shRNA-Calpain-10 significantly was consistent with the
finding that Calpain-10 induction by Biseugenol-treated
regulated AhR expression result in control Snail function
(Figure 6D-6E). We further to investigate the function
relationship between AhR and Snail, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were been carried out. As shown
in Figure 6F, similarly, we found that Biseugenol could
thwart AhR bind to the promoter of Snail and repress
transcription expression. Therefore, Biseugenol is unique
in its ability to induce epithelial cell signature via a AhR–

Snail–E-cadherin constraint axis mechanism.

In vivo biomakers of Biseugenol activity
In order to verify in vivo hypothesis and the
mechanistic findings in Biseugenol promising therapy
effects, animal tissues analyses were performed.
As has been shown above, the growth or peritoneal
dissemination of cancer cells can be reduced by exposure
with Biseugenol and by Calpain-10-induced inhibition
of AhR–Snail–E-cadherin repression axis. The profile
for animal tissues was similar. Our data demonstrated
that suppression of AhR by shRNA-AhR or exposure
Biseugenol-induced Calpain-10-activity could reduce
tumor growth or peritoneal dissemination in tumor
tissues (Figure 7A). The works provide a valuable
biomarker that could be used in future clinical trials and

Illustrating the working hypothesis that Biseugenol–induced ER stress was involved in the inhibition of EMT and peritoneal dissemination
of gastric cancer tumors. Increased Snail signaling by AhR activation down-regulates phosphorylation of E-cadherin production. Increased
Calpain-10 expression induced by Biseugenol triggers the cleavage of AhR, which subsequently inhibits Snail expression, leading to
phosphorylation of E-cadherin up-regulation.

of Biseugenol. These data aid with the hypothesis that
peritoneal dissemination mediated by EMT via the AhR–
Snail–E-cadherin repression axis plays a pivotal role in
the progression of gastric cancer cells in vivo. A model of
working hypothesis is presented as Figure 7B.

Hydrocarbon Receptor-Interacting Protein; p23), protein
kinases and phosphatases, casein kinase-2, PKC, and
coactivators [35;36]. Indeed, a constitutively active AhR
expressed has been found by Andersson et al. in transgenic
mice reduced the life span of the mice and induced
tumors in the glandular part of the stomach, manifesting
the oncogenic potential of the AhR and suggesting the
receptor in regulation of cell proliferation [12]. In addition,
AhR activation has been associated with an increase in
cyclooxygenase-2 and chronic inflammation leading to
increased cancer risk [37-41]. Increasing expression of
AhR has been found in breast cancer, gastric cancer, colon
adenocarcinoma and lung cancer [12;39-41]. Activation
of AhR regulates the activation of the mitogen-activated
protein kinase or JunD, which is critically involved
in contact inhibitor, inflammation, oncogenic events
and tumor progression [13]. The higher AhR activity is
partially attributed to a variety of signals, including Tolllike receptor ligands, proinflammatory cytokine, and
toxicant stimulates, and AhR is also able to transducer
additional downstream transcription factor resulting
in signaling cascade [13;16;33;35]. Environmental
xenobiotics, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
congener TCDD and PCBs, a specific activator of AhR,
which also stimulated protein kinase phosphorylation and
furthermore induced tumor promotion, have been shown
to have strong associations with formation of cancer
[13;15;16;32-36]. Halogenated biphenyls, known as PCBs,
are industrial toxicants associated with the activation of
AhR and downstream adverse effects, including cancer.
Of interest, Biseugenol is also a biphenyl, but unlike
PCBs, have electron donating hydroxyl and allyl groups
in comparison to the electron withdrawing halogens of
PCBs. Otherwise, there is strong evidence that it may
act as a paradoxically effect in tumor suppressor. Lossof-function studies for AhR indicate that AhR might
have physiologic functions. The AhR-null phenotype
included increased F-actin stress fibers, depolarized
focal adhesions, and enhanced spreading and adhesion
[42]. Importantly, AhR knockout mice exhibit decreased
tumorigenicity and migration in a xenograft model due
to downregulation of the proto-oncogene Vav3 leading
to diminish in Rac1 activity in AhR-/- mouse embryonic
fibroblasts. Ahr-/- dermal fibroblasts secreted higher levels
of active TGFβ that increased keratinocyte migration
in culture and that could account for over-activation of
the TGFβ pathway and for faster wound healing in the
AhR-null neo-epithelium, indicating that loss of dioxinreceptor expression accelerates wound healing in vivo
by a mechanism involving TGFβ [43;44]. However, the
mechanism underlying Ahr on EMT and cancer peritoneal
dissemination remained unknown. Although previous
studies suggest that AhR possesses different functions, the
role of AhR in cancer cells and in regulating peritoneal
dissemination remains poorly understood. In clinical, the
present study shows that AhR expression is correlated

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we investigated the role
of Biseugenol in gastric tumor growth and peritoneal
dissemination in vivo and in vitro. Our results revealed
that Biseugenol-induced ER stress significantly suppressed
peritoneal dissemination and organ metastasis in nude
mice through specific Calpain-10 activation and AhR
down-regulation. Furthermore, Biseugenol extremely
impeded the development of mesenchymal feature and
enhanced the expression of epithelial signature markers
in vivo and in vitro, manifesting that Biseugenol targets
EMT to thwart peritoneal dissemination of gastric tumors
growth. In this study, we also established that Biseugenol
targets AhR signaling and controls transcription repression
Snail expression leading to the induction of E-cadherin
phosphorylation, which accordingly represses peritoneal
dissemination.
EMT refers to a biological process in which cells
undergo a series of biochemical changes that induce a
morphological transformation from an epithelial, polarized,
adhesive state to an irregular, elongated, mesenchymal
phenotype that enables migratory capacity that results
in the up-regulation of transcriptional modulators such
as Snail, Twist, β-catenin and Smad, Slug, C/EBPβ, NFκB, AP-1, as well as the loss of adherence molecules, and
the acquirement of new moieties essential for cell growth
and progression [1;30;31]. However, although factors
impart available transcription factors to cancer cells, none
of them specify the concrete targeting of AhR. AhR is a
member of the bHLH (basic Helix–Loop–Helix)-PAS
(Per-ARNT-Sim) family of transcriptional regulators that
controls the expression of a diverse set of genes. AhR, also
known as the Dioxin receptor, is identified as the criminal
for most toxic responses discovered after exposure to
PAH (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons), Dioxins
(e.g. TCDD (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin)), and
Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) [32-34]. AhR that plays
an important role in the interact with signaling pathways
that are mediated by NF-κB, hypoxia, estrogen receptor,
other hormone receptors and retinoblastoma protein in
a variety of cell types, and promotes cell proliferation
[13]. AhR exists in a dormant state within the cytoplasm
in association with a complex of Heat Shock Protein-90
(HSP90), HSP90 Co-chaperone p23, XAP2 and AIP, that
is required for the physiological activation and interactions
with various regulatory and signaling proteins, including
PAS heterodimerization partners ARNT, chaperone
and immunophilin-like proteins (e.g. HSP90, AIP (Aryl

with malignant progression in patient’s clinicopathological
data. Increased AhR staining score in the primary gastric
tumor highly associated with the presence of distant
metastasis. Biseugenol inhibits AhR expression that
markedly diminishes tumor peritoneal dissemination and
reduces tumor growth in a mouse model. Other evidence
demonstrates that knockdown AhR activity causes tumor
burden changes and inhibits tumor growth within 2-4
weeks. These changes are in agreement with the results
of PET/CT imaging studies and nodule counts in the
present study. Therefore, constitutively high levels of AhR
activity may agitate cell regulation and lead to abnormal
functioning in cells.
ER stress triggers UPR, a signaling pathway for
adaptive response. UPR initially exerts a protective effect
by lowering protein synthesis, upregulation of specific
ER stress-regulated genes and inhibition of general
protein translation via transient adaptation or longer-term
adaptation. However, severe or prolonged ER stress results
in cell death via apoptotic signaling, is triggered, which
could be taken as a therapeutic stratagem in cancer therapy
or used in conjunction with existing therapies. Recently
evidence indicates that targeting ER stress correlation
with inhibition of angiogenesis in vivo [2;3;5;6;21]. Our
previous study has demonstrated that ER stress-induced
by Honokiol consequence human gastric cancer cell
apoptosis and suppresses tumorigenesis via a Calpain-IImediated, glucose-regulated protein-94 cleavage [29]. In
addition, our group also shown direct evidence that the
ER were swelled and fragmented in organelles structure
in Honokiol-exposure gastric cancer cells and HUVECs
[5]. Furthermore, we demonstrated for the first time that
Honokiol-induced STAT-3 dephosphorylation, which
via calpain-II/SHP-1 interaction has a direct regulation
[5]. Lastly, therapeutic inhibition of Tpl2 by Honokiol
thwarts both gastric tumor growth and peritoneal
dissemination by inducing ER stress and inhibiting
EMT [2]. These evidences revealed that Honokiol may
be beneficial in inducing ER stress and may employ
its effect comparison with antiangiogenesis in gastric
cancer therapy. This finding is agreement with the results
reported by Banerjee A et al. which exhibited that UPR
is required in nu/nu mice microvasculature for treating
breast tumor with tunicamycin, further then reducing
angiogenesis in vivo [3]. In the present work, we found
that both Tunicamycin (3 and 5 μg/ml) and Eug (40 μM)
induced the increase in subG0/G1 population after cell
starvation for 6 hours. Both Tunicamycin (3-5 μg/ml)
and Eug (40 μM) could also enhance the expressions of
Grp78, p-elf2α, and DR5 and reduce the expression of
AhR in gastric cancer cells. Moreover, both Tunicamycin
and Eug could also enhance the ERSE activity in gastric
cancer cells. However, Tunicamycin and Eug seem to be
no synergic effects on these assays. Nevertheless, these
results suggest that Eugenol probably have similarity
with tunicamycin in inducing ER stress. Li Y and

colleagues proved that downregulation of heparanase
could suppress ER stress-induced invasion and migration
of breast cancer cells [45]. Chiu et al. have also found
that the combined treatment with inhibitor of histone
deacetylase such as Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid,
enhances radiosensitivity and suppresses lung metastasis
in breast cancer in vitro and in vivo via an ER stressrelated mechanism [46]. Hence, these results indicate
that targeting ER stress to induce a reversal of EMT and
invasion or migration might provide a strong rationale
for the development of anticancer therapeutics for the
prevention of metastasis.
Calpains are calcium-dependent intracellular nonlysosomal proteases. Calpain-10 is the atypical calpains
in tissues along with m- and µ-calpains, and its certain
domains have been replaced or deleted. Interesting, domain
IV (calmodulin-like calcium binding sites) of Calpain-10
was replaced with a divergent T domain containing no
calcium-binding EF-hand structures [47]. Previous study
have reported that genetic variation in the Calpain-10 gene
was associated with an increased risk for type 2 diabetes
mellitus in certain human population groups has been
reported by Horikawa groups [48]. Hong et al have shown
that Calpain-10 protein is ubiquitously expressed in tissues
from insects’ cells to human, in which it could potentially
affect a number of tissue processes ranging from lens
differentiation [47]. Moreover, it has been demonstrated
in vitro that nonspecific calpain inhibitors ALLM (100
mM) and E-64-d (200 mM) induce alterations of glucoseinduced insulin secretion in mouse islets [49]. These
findings imply that Calpain-10 in pathologic conditions.
However, to our knowledge, nothing is known about the
protein expression or cellular function of calpain 10 or the
cellular and molecular mechanisms related to ER stress
in the development, progression, and metastasis of cancer
still remain to be clarified. In the present work, we found
that Biseugenol activates Calpain-10 activity and protein
expression, but not traditional m- or µ-calpains. Transient
transfection siRNA-Calpain-10 effectively reversed
Biseugenol-induced ER stress, calpain activity and AhR
down-regulation. In addition, in vitro cleavage assay in
cancer cells is response to AhR cleavage fragment in a
dose-dependent manner. These results provide evidence
that Calpain-10 activation dampen EMT program is
induced in cancer cells under ER stress induction, which
can be provoked by Biseugenol-treated condition. Hence,
Calpain-10 activation may be taken as another one of
atypical ER stress marker.
In conclusion, our studies revealed that Biseugenol
suppressed the EMT program through ER stress and
the Calpain-10/AhR/Snail axis pathway. In addition,
knockdown AhR activity also dramatically reduced
peritoneal dissemination, which helps uncover mysteries
function of cancer cells and repertory. Consistently, it has
recently been shown that AhR exhibits abundant amounts,
and disruption of AhR suppresses the tumor growth.

Additionally, AhR may be a useful prognostic marker for
gastric cancer and novel therapeutic targets for gastric
cancer invasion intervention.Taken together, targeting
Calpain-10 may help eliminate AhR, thereby preventing
cancer progression. We suppose that future clinical trials
designed to evaluate the efficacy of Calpain-10 on the
prevention of peritoneal dissemination, and recurrence
will be of importance.
