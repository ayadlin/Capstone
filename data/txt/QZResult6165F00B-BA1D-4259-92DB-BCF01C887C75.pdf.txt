Abstract
MK-0457 and MK-5108 are novel aurora kinase inhibitors (AKi) leading to G2–M cell-cycle arrest. Growth and
survival of multiple lymphoma cell lines were studied with either drug alone or in combination with vorinostat, a
histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), using MTS and Annexin V assays, followed by molecular studies. Either of
the AKi alone at 100 to 500 nmol/L resulted in approximately 50% reduced cell growth and 10% to 40% apoptosis.
Addition of vorinostat reactivated proapoptotic genes and enhanced lymphoma cell death. Quantitative PCR
and immunoblotting revealed that epigenetic and protein acetylation mechanisms were responsible for this
activity. The prosurvival genes Bcl-XL and hTERT were downregulated 5-fold by combination drug treatment,
whereas the proapoptotic BAD and BID genes were upregulated 3-fold. The p53 tumor suppressor was stabilized
by an increased acetylation in response to vorinostat and a reduced Ser315 phosphorylation in response to
aurora kinase A. Vorinostat or trichostatin A decreased MYC mRNA and protein as well as c-Myc-regulated
microRNAs. MYC is a critical gene in these responses, as MYC knockdown combined with the expression of the
c-Myc antagonist MXD1 raised cell sensitivity to the effects of either AKi. Thus, the HDACi vorinostat leads to
both transcriptional and posttranscriptional changes to create a proapoptotic milieu, sensitizing cells to mitosisspecific agents such as AKis. Cancer Res; 71(11); 3912–20. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The aurora kinases are Ser/Thr protein kinases active
during late G2 and M phases of the cell cycle. Aurora kinases
(AK) A, B, and C regulate key functions during mitosis and
thus are logical drug targets for cancer therapies. AK-A is
amplified in several tumor types including lymphomas (1),
localizes to centrosomes, and is required for spindle body
formation. AK-B is present at the midbody of paired sister
chromosomes, including the kinetochores. AK-C is expressed
predominantly in germ cells and is the least studied member
of the family (2). AK-A phosphorylates p53 at Ser315, leading

to its ubiquitination by MDM2 and subsequent proteolysis (3).
Consequently, depleting cells of AK-A with siRNA leads to p53
stabilization and increased numbers of cells in the G2–M cellcycle phase (3). Known AK-B substrates include serine 10 of
histone 3 (H3-Ser10) and vimentin (4, 5). Here we test the panAK inhibitor MK-0457 (previously VX-680; ref. 2) and the AK-A
specific inhibitor, MK-5108, alone and in combination with the
deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat.
Agents affecting epigenetic targets, such as histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), may enhance the antitumor activity
of antimitotic agents such as aurora kinase inhibitors (AKi) in
several ways. HDACis can upregulate genes involved in DNA
damage recognition and response, including those directly
involved in cell-cycle control and apoptosis (6, 7). Furthermore,
deacetylase inhibitors can lead to apoptosis through acetylation and stabilization of nonhistone proteins such as p53 (8, 9).
AK inhibition primarily leads to cell-cycle arrest in the G2–M
phase, but not necessarily to cell death. Thus, combining an
AKi with an HDACi such as vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid; generic name, vorinostat; trade name, Zolinza;
Merck & Co.) may reactivate the proapoptotic capacity of cells
and render them more sensitive to apoptosis triggered by cellcycle inhibition. We show this to be the case, and describe
changes in gene-expression levels for MYC (c-Myc), TERT
(human telomerase enzymatic reverse transcriptase; hTERT),
TP53 (p53), and microRNAs (miRNA) related to lymphomagenesis (10, 11), which may contribute to the enhanced sensitivity of cells to AKi in the presence of vorinostat.

Cell-cycle and apoptosis assays
Log-phase cells were brought to 0.25  106/mL and 1 mL
aliquots were plated in 12-well plates with drug concentrations as indicated in figures. After 2- and 3-day incubations,
cells were centrifuged with cold PBS washes. For cell-cycle
analysis, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol and treated with
propidium iodide (PI) staining solution: PBS þ 0.1% (vol/vol)
Triton X-100, 0.2 mg/mL RNase A (DNase-free), and 0.02 mg/
mL PI. Cells were incubated for 15 minutes at 37oC and then
overnight at 4oC with flow cytometric analysis the next day.
For apoptosis determination, cells were assayed by Annexin VFITC Apoptosis Detection Kit 1 (BD Biosciences) according to
manufacturer's instructions and analyzed by flow cytometry.
RNA isolation, RT, and quantitative PCR
Cells were washed 2 times in cold PBS and cell pellets frozen
at 80oC. For mRNA analysis, RNA was extracted with Qiagen
EZ-1 reagents according to manufacturer's recommendations,
quantified, and reverse transcribed with Invitrogen SuperScript III reagents, with 2 mg total RNA þ 5 ng/mL random
hexamers. One-tenth volumes of reverse transcription reactions were analyzed by real-time PCR by Applied Biosystems
reagents (ABI) by using either SYBR-Green or Taq-Man 2x
Master Mixes. Reactions were run for 40 cycles of 95oC and
60oC alternation, for 15 and 30 seconds, respectively. Quantification was relative to multiple housekeeping genes expressed
in lymphatic cells, by the geometric-mean method (12).
For miRNA analysis, cell pellets were extracted with mirVana isolation reagents by Ambion, quantified, and reverse
transcribed with miRNA-specific primers and enzyme mix
(Ambion or ABI), according to manufacturer's directions. Onetenth volume of RT product was analyzed with separate,
miRNA-specific PCR primer pairs (Ambion or ABI). PCR
was with ABI reagents, as described, using the ABI 2x
SYBR-Green Master Mix with Ambion primers, and ABI 2x

again brought to 0.25  106/mL. Cells were divided into 4
fractions and drugs added as shown in Figure 4B. Cells were
incubated for 24 hours, quickly harvested by 4 C centrifugation, washed once with approximately 500 mL ice-cold PBS,
and once with 10 mL of cold-PBS plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma). The resulting pellets were lysed
and prepared for immunoblotting (6).
MYC knockdown and MXD1 overexpression
siRNAs directed against MYC message were sense: 50 CUGAGACAGAUCAGCAACAACCGdAdA-30 and antisense:
50 -UUCGGUUGUUGCUGAUCUGUCUCAGGA-30 . All nucleotides are ribose form except the 2 underlined at the 30 end
of the sense strand. The negative siRNA was the control, #6201,
from Cell Signaling Technology. Overexpression of Myc antagonist Mxd1 was from plasmid pRc/CMV (14, designated "RCMVMad") with empty pRc/CMV as control. siRNA-Myc and/or
pRc/CMV-Mxd1, or their controls, were introduced into L540
cells by nucleofection by using reagents and electroporation
device by Amaxa/Lonza. Two million cells, concentrated by
centrifugation from log-phase cultures, were used per transfection. Electroporation volume was 100 mL L-buffer mixed
with supplement and nucleic acids, according to the manufacturer's instructions, using the X-001 electroporation setting. Final concentration of siRNA during electroporation was
400 nmol/L and amount of plasmid per transfection was 2 mg.
Five minutes after electroporation, cells were washed out of
cuvettes with prewarmed 0.5 mL antibiotic-free RPMI-1640
with 10% FBS, and added to an additional 1 mL of the same

medium. The volume was increased by 5 mL of the same
medium the next day. The numbers of viable cells—determined
by Trypan blue exclusion and typically being 70% to 75%—were
counted and used at 10,000 live cells per well in 96-well plates
for MTS experiments, with drug additions begun the day after
transfection. Each drug condition was tested in triplicate wells,
and MTS reagent added 72 hours after drug addition (96 hours
after transfection).
Statistical methods
Pairwise comparisons by Dunnett's test were carried out to
compare apoptosis and cell growth/survival between each
drug treatment compared with vorinostat (Fig. 1). To evaluate
the dose–response relationship of vorinostat to lymphoma cell
gene expression, a linear regression was carried out for each
gene with dose as the independent variable and individual
gene expression as the dependent variable (Fig. 3). T tests were
conducted to compare miRNA expression response between
the various vorinostat and AKi treatments compared with the
DMSO reference (Fig. 5). All significance testing were carried
out by SAS V9.2 and all reported P values are 2-sided, using an
a-level of 0.05.

growth inhibition by each drug, as determined by MTS assays.
Inhibition was dose dependent and combinations of both
drugs inhibited cell growth more than any drug alone at
the lower doses. We obtained similar results with the other
cell lines tested (Table 1; Supplementary Fig. S1A). Order-ofaddition experiments showed no greater effect than with
simultaneous addition of drugs (data not shown).
These data allowed us to calculate IC50 and combination
index (CI) values. Table 1 shows that for most lymphoma cell
lines the IC50s of these drugs were in the submicromolar range
(left half of table). The few exceptions were in relative sensitivities to one or the other AKi. For 5 of 6 lines tested—
excepting the DHL-6 cells-–the IC50 values of MK-0457 were
lower than those of MK-5108. We also determined CI values
(Table 1, right), showing that combining AKis MK-0457 or MK5108 with vorinostat had an additive (CI ¼ 0.85–1.1) or
frequently synergistic effect (CI ¼ 0.1–0.85). There were no
consistent differences in CI values between AKis when combined with vorinostat.
Apoptosis data (Fig. 1B) suggested that the growth inhibition seen in MTS assays was not primarily because of cell-cycle
arrest or longer cycling times, but because of time- and dosedependent increases in apoptosis, as assayed by Annexin V cell
labeling. The combination of vorinostat and an AKi was
consistently more effective in promoting cell death than
any drug alone in L540 cells, with similar data obtained in
Daudi (Supplementary Fig. S1B), KM-H2, and DHL-4 cells (not
shown).

obtained similar results with the HL cell line KM-H2 and the
NHL cell line Daudi, a Burkitt's lymphoma (Supplementary
Fig. S2; Supplementary Table S1). The additivity, or in some
cases, synergy of these 2 drugs is reflected in the enrichment
of sub-G1 phase cells when both drugs are present. Cell size
determination showed most cells treated with MK-0457
were enlarged, whereas those treated additionally with
vorinostat were smaller than control cells (not shown),
consistent with sub-G1 phase dead and/or dying cells. Along
with enlargement, there was evidence of endoreduplication
(8N DNA) in some assays, with small cell populations beyond
the G2–M peak (not shown). The percentage of apoptosis in
each condition exceeds that of cells in sub-G1, as Annexin V
labels intact cells early in apoptosis as well as further
degraded ones.

The extent of apoptosis with vorinostat plus either AKi
was 2- to 7-fold greater than with either AKi alone, presumably because AK inhibition leads primarily to cell-cycle
arrest rather than cell death. To discriminate between cellcycle arrest and death, we carried out cell-cycle analysis,
with representative results for L540 cells shown in Figure 2.
Incubation in 1.5 mmol/L vorinostat (Fig. 2B) enlarges a
modest subpopulation of cells in the sub-G1 region, often
indicative of dead cells, whereas treatment with 100 nmol/L
MK-0457 (Fig. 2C) produces a large increase in cells arrested
in the G2–M phase, and a small increase in the sub-G1 region.
Significantly, the 2 drugs together shift a substantial proportion of the L540 cells into the sub-G1 population (Fig. 2D).
Percentages of cell populations in each cell-cycle phase for
various treatments are listed in Supplementary Table S1. We

Vorinostat Plus Aurora Kinase Inhibitors for Lymphoma

Vorinostat brings about changes in lymphoma cell gene
expression
We carried out real-time PCR analysis of drug-treated L540
cells to determine reasons for the drugs’ effects on the cell
cycle and apoptosis. AKi treatment had little effect on the
expression of the genes we analyzed, in contrast to strong
effects seen with HDAC inhibition. Vorinostat led to downregulation of several genes, most notably MYC (Fig. 3A), TERT,
and BCL2L1 (Fig. 3B). Vorinostat downregulated another
antiapoptotic gene, MCL1, whereas BCL2 levels changed very
little (not shown). Because vorinostat downregulated message
levels of MYC, we assayed levels of the c-Myc antagonist,
MXD1 (originally MAD1; 14), and found it was simultaneously
upregulated (Fig. 3A). Such inverse patterns of expression of
MYC and MXD1 genes have been seen in multiple cell types
studied, often in cells exiting the cell cycle and/or undergoing
differentiation (15, 16).
In contrast to downregulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-XL and
Mcl-1, vorinostat upregulated the proapoptotic genes BAD,
BID, and NOXA (Fig. 3C). Most gene expression changes were
apparent within 4 hours of vorinostat addition (Fig. 3A and C)
and were still variably present at 24 hours for c-Myc and MXD1
(Supplementary Fig. S2A); TERT and BCL2L1 (Fig. 3B); and
NOXA (Supplementary Fig. S2C). However, BAD and BID message level increases were an early event, seen only at the 4-hour
time point (Fig. 3C). By 24 hours their expression levels were at
baseline or somewhat repressed (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
Immunoblotting experiments confirmed quantitative PCR
(qPCR) results and assessed posttranslational changes in L540
cell proteins (Fig. 4). Figure 4A shows vorinostat concentration-dependent increases in acetylation at the histone H3
lysine-9 residue (H3-K9), which were unchanged by addition
of MK-0457. Acetylation of p53 seemed less sensitive to
vorinostat compared with H3-K9, becoming apparent only
at higher concentrations. Acetylation of p53 was also seen in
response to MK-0457, with greater response when combined
with 3 mmol/L vorinostat (Fig. 4A); acetylation of p53 is known
to lead to stabilization (17). MK-0457–mediated increased p53
acetylation was associated with increased protein levels of
p53-target p21Waf1/Cip1, and the mRNA levels of p53-target
NOXA (Fig. 3C). Although the amount of p21 and p27 proteins
increased in response to vorinostat or MK-0457 alone and in
response to MK-0457 in combination with the lowest dose of
vorinostat, the levels of these proteins subsequently decreased
in response to MK-0457 in combination with the highest dose
of vorinostat. This is in agreement with other studies showing
that downregulation of p21 or p27 makes cells more prone to
apoptosis (6, 18) and is also consistent with accumulation of
cells in sub-G1 (Fig. 2). The Western blot data in Figure 4A
confirmed at the protein level the downregulation of c-Myc as
gene and FOXO3A genes detected by qPCR (Fig. 3A and data
not shown). Similarly, Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 protein levels were
also reduced (Fig. 4A).
Cell-cycle block experiments using the microtubule poison
nocodazole allowed us to enrich for protein isoforms transiently present during the G2–M phase that are difficult to
detect in nonsynchronized cells (Fig. 4B). Utilizing synchronized cell populations we were able to visualize the phos-

phorylated forms of 3 AK targets by Western blot assay. p53 is
normally phosphorylated at Ser315 by AK-A, leading to its
association with the ubiquitin ligase MDM2 and proteosome
destruction (3). Phosphorylation of p53 at Ser46 is strongly
associated with proapoptotic activity of this tumor suppressor
(19). Histone H3 is a known substrate for AK-B phosphorylation at serine 10 resulting in dissociation of heterochromatin
protein 1 during mitosis. (4). To assess the effects of aurora
kinase treatment on these substrates, we treated L540 cells
with nocodazole, with or without MK-0457, and compared
them to cells treated with MK-0457 alone and to control
cycling cells. Cell-cycle analyses (not shown) indicated that
both MK-0457 and nocodazole blocked cycling; the nocodazole-treated cells with or without MK-0457 were similarly
enriched for G2–M phase cells (nocodazole, 42%; MK-0457,
45%; both drugs, 53%). All drug-treated cells also had similar
viability (nocodazole, 73%; MK-0457, 75%; both drugs, 79%) All
3 phosphoproteins analyzed were expressed at low levels in
cycling cells (Fig. 4B, lane 1) but accumulated at detectable
levels in the presence of nocodazole. MK-0457 inhibited the
phosphorylation of histone H3 in the presence of nocodazole.
p53 phosphorylation at both Ser 315 and Ser46 was also
inhibited by MK-0457 in the presence of nocodazole.
Vorinostat and AKi treatments lead to changes in
microRNA levels
miRNAs are key regulators of cell growth and differentiation
by virtue of posttranscriptional inhibition of mRNA stability
and/or translation (20, 21). c-Myc transcriptionally activates
the miRNA 17–92 cluster (10, 11). Because vorinostat repressed
c-Myc message and protein (Figs. 3 and 4), we tested expression
levels of 3 members of this miRNA cluster—miR-17.5p, miR17.3p, and miR-18—in response to vorinostat, the unrelated
HDACi trichostatin A (TSA), and MK-0457 in L540 (Fig. 5A) and
DHL-4 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Treatment with HDACi
resulted in decreases in all 3 miRNAs relative to untreated cells
HDACi also induced changes in 3 miRNAs that are not mycregulated—miR-15b, miR-34a, and miR-155—as shown in Figure 5B and Supplementary Figure S5B for L540 and DHL-4 cells,
respectively. The 2 cell types have distinct changes in the
expression of these miRNAs, possibly reflecting biological
differences between the different lymphoma types involved
(HL versus B-cell lymphoma).
Role of MYC downregulation and MXD1 upregulation
by vorinostat AKi combination
Finally, we sought to determine the importance of HDACiinduced c-myc downregulation in lymphoma cell responses
to combined HDAC/AK inhibition. To model this downregulation in the absence of HDACi, we transfected L540 cells with
siRNA directed at MYC mRNA, and/or overexpressed the MYC
antagonist, MXD1, followed by titration of either MK-0457 or
MK-5108 (Fig. 5C and D). Knockdown of MYC message was
difficult in L540 cells, typically reaching a 50% decrease at 48 to
72 hours (not shown). Thus, siRNA-MYC had only a small
negative effect on cell survival in response to MK-0457
(Fig. 5C) and a slightly greater effect with MK-5108 (Fig. 5D).
MXD1 overexpression (Fig. 5C and D, turquoise line) led to

similar results. However, on combining myc knockdown with
MXD1 expression (Fig. 5C and D, green lines) L540 cells clearly
became more sensitive to both AKis. The IC50 of MK-0457
(Fig. 5C, blue line) was decreased from approximately 0.5 to 0.1
mmol/L by combined treatment, whereas that of MK-5108
(Fig. 5D, blue line) went from approximately 1.8 mmol/L (by
extrapolation) to approximately 0.35 mmol/L. Thus, combining
myc knockdown with MXD1 overexpression recapitulates the
synergistic effect of combining vorinostat with the AKis, which
we postulate is in part due to decreased myc levels after
treatment.

Discussion
We have studied the effects of MK-0457 and MK-5108,
prototype AKis, in combination with histone deacetylase
inhibitor vorinostat. Both drugs inhibit AK-A, and MK-0457
also inhibits AK-B; alone their AKi activity exerts strong
negative cell-cycle effects on both HL and NHL cells, but
has modest consequences for overall cell growth and survival
(Figs. 11 and 2). We hypothesized that AKi-induced arrest of
cells in G2–M phase results in activated intracellular stress
signaling pathways, but that in cancer cells this cellular
response is blunted by epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor and proapoptotic genes. Thus, the HDACi vorinostat could
potentially exert a synergistic or at least additive effect when
combined with AKis. This proves to be the case in lymphoma
cells, as also seen in acute and chronic myelogenous leukemia
cells when combining vorinostat and MK-0457 (22, 23).Given
the similar responses of cells treated with both MK-0457 and
MK-5108, we hypothesize that it is inhibition of AK-A that is
central to the activity in lymphoma cell lines.
The effects of AK inhibition on gene expression levels are
modest, whereas those of vorinostat are extensive. Key effects
of HDAC inhibition were downregulation of MYC, TERT,
BCL2L1, MCL1, and FOXO3A, and upregulation of cell-cycle
inhibitors p21 and p27 and the proapoptotic genes BAD, BID,
and NOXA, seen in both qPCR and immunoblot assays.
Immunoblotting also showed posttranslational effects of vorinostat and MK-0457 on p53, leading to stabilization and
increased activity of p53.
Telomerase expression often plays a critical role in cancer
cell progression, including hematologic neoplasias (24). The
rate-limiting component of the telomerase holoenzyme is the
catalytic subunit, hTERT (25). HDACi-induced hTERT regulation has been seen in many cell types (26, 27), typically in the
form of TERT derepression (28, 29). This report is the first
describing TERT downregulation, with a 25-fold decrease in
gene expression following HDAC inhibition in lymphoma cells
The mechanistic reasons for this unique result are unclear and
may have interesting cell-type specific implications. The TERT
gene is a positive transcriptional target of MYC and is
repressed by the Mxd proteins (30, 31). Vorinostat-induced
MYC downregulation and MXD1 upregulation in lymphoma
cells can thus explain hTERT gene repression. Increased
telomerase expression can accompany disease progression,
for example, higher expression in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) blast crisis patients compared with those in the

3918

chronic phase (32). Notably, successful imatinib mesylate
treatment of CML reduces telomerase activity (33), whereas
high telomerase levels correlate with imatinib resistance (34).
These observations suggest HDACi-induced TERT downregulation is a biologically significant event in vorinostat inhibition
of lymphoma cell growth.
miRNAs are key regulators of cell growth and differentiation
due to messenger RNA downregulation (20, 21). Their differential expression can be used to classify multiple human
tumor types, including subtypes of lymphomas (35, 36). We
show dose-dependent downregulation of miR-17-5p, miR-173p, and miR-18 by vorinostat and TSA in L540 and DHL4 cells.
These miRNAs are part of the miR-17–92 miRNA cluster,
which is MYC regulated and oncogenic in a Burkitt's lymphoma mouse model, and is also implicated in other cancers
(10. 11, 37). HDACi downregulation of these miRNAs is thus
biologically significant and mechanistically plausible, given
simultaneous repression of myc levels by HDACi.
Three other non–Myc-regulated miRNAs of significance in
lymphomas and other hematologic cancers—miR-15b, miR-34a,
and miR-155—exhibited responses to HDAC inhibition. miRNAs
of the miR-15 and miR-16 family target the mRNA of BCL2 and
their upregulation is thus associated with apoptosis (38, 39). We
saw dose-dependent downregulation of miR-15b in L540 and
DHL-4 cell lines by vorinostat or TSA. miR-34a is a positive
transcriptional target of p53 (40) and was strongly upregulated
in DHL-4 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5); however, its levels
declined in L540 cells with HDACi treatment (Fig. 5). miR-155
is generated from sequences within the non–protein-coding BIC
RNA, and both RNAs are upregulated in some HL and diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) samples correlating with the
activated B-cell phenotype (41, 42). miR-155 also has antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities in melanoma cells and
hematopoietic stem cells (43, 44). We observed increases in miR155 after HDACi treatment in L540 cells, although it was
repressed in DHL-4 cells. Variable behavior of miR-34a and
miR-155 may reflect the different lymphoma types represented
by L540 and DHL-4 cells. Differential effects on cells, of changes
in the miRNA levels after treatment, as opposed to steady state
overexpression, may contribute to differences in miR-155 activity between cell types.
We have shown the importance of MYC downregulation
in response to vorinostat alone and in the combined response
to AKis and HDACis. In another hematopoietic malignancy
model, reduced MYC levels are critical for acute myeloid
leukemia cell growth arrest by the HDACi valproic acid (45).
MYC levels decline in many cell types undergoing differentiation, whereas those of MXD genes increase (15, 16). This
counterbalance is consistent with a requirement for both
MYC knockdown and MXD1 overexpression combined with
AKi treatment, to mimic the synergistic effect of vorinostat
combined with an AKi. Deacetylase inhibitors are under
intense study in hematologic malignancies, with vorinostat
currently Food and Drug Administration–approved for treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (46). HDAC inhibitory
agents have multiple activities in lymphoid cells, ranging from
direct antitumor activity to suppression of the activated
immune response and cytokine storm (47). We have shown

the effects of vorinostat on various targets, such as p53, hTERT,
Bcl-2 family members, c-Myc, and multiple miRNAs. These
data strengthen the hypothesis that treatment of tumor cells
with deacetylase inhibitors promotes a set of proapoptotic
changes at the epigenetic and protein level. This is consistent
with data reported in various leukemia types treated with
vorinostat (22, 23), in which changes in proapoptotic protein
levels led to enhanced activity when combined with AKis.
Elucidating the mechanisms by which HDACis sensitize lymphoma cells to other agents should assist in the development of
clinical combination trials. Our data suggest that one such trial
should include the combination of deacetylase inhibitors with
mitotic deregulators such as AKis.
