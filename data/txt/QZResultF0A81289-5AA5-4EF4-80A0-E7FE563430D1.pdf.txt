ABSTRACT
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and
drug-resistance in osteosarcoma (OS), but the underlying mechanisms remain
incompletely understood. Here, we examined the regulation of P-gp, GRP78, and
phospho-Akt in doxorubicin (DOX)-treated OS cells. DOX induced P-gp expression,
which was associated with increased GRP78 levels and Akt activation in vitro and
in vivo. Functional analysis showed that Akt induces P-gp and GRP78 expression,
which contributes to the DOX-induced Akt activation. Examination of the relationship
between Akt and GRP78 demonstrated that GRP78 suppression attenuates the
Akt activity in OS parental sensitive and resistant cells, indicating that GRP78 is
required for full Akt activity. Inhibition of Akt activity using MK2206 decreased GRP78
expression in OS cells, which enhanced the inhibitory effect of MK2206 on P-gp
expression. GRP78 knockdown combined with MK2206 suppressed the development
of DOX resistance in OS cells and inhibited the in vivo tumor growth in the presence
of DOX. These results support the development of novel therapeutic strategies that
target GRP78 and Akt to sensitize OS cells for chemotherapy.

INTRODUCTION

in the heat shock protein-70 (HSP70) promoter, are
located upstream from the transcription initiation site
[12, 13]. The glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78, also
referred to as BiP), a major endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
chaperone, is a member of the HSP70 protein family [14].
During ER stress, which usually occurs under cytotoxic
chemical stimulation or UV radiation, cells initiate an
unfolded protein response (UPR), which employs GRP78
as a necessary regulator to maintain homeostasis of ER
function [15, 16]. Overexpression of GRP78 in cancer
cells has been associated with drug resistance and
enhanced malignancy [17]. P-gp levels positively correlate
with GRP78 expression, despite the lack of evidence of
direct association between P-gp and GRP78 [5, 18, 19].
The serine/threonine kinase Akt, a primary
downstream mediator of phospho-inositide 3-kinase
(PI3K) signaling, modulates cell proliferation, migration,
survival, and death [20]. Studies have suggested that Akt
promotes cell survival by inducing P-gp expression under
chemotherapeutic conditions, and that GRP78 promotes

P-glycoprotein (P-gp, also known as ABCB1)
overexpression is an important mechanism of inherent
and acquired multidrug resistance (MDR) in human
osteosarcoma (OS) [1–3]. P-gp levels serve as a prognostic
marker and correlate with poor chemotherapeutic response
[4–6]. Notably, MDR-associated protein 1 (MRP1)
and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), which are
two eminent ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters
that modulate anticancer drug uptake and efflux, do not
correlate as closely as P-gp with an MDR phenotype
[5, 7–9]. P-gp positive variants can be selected from P-gp
negative parental uterine sarcoma MES-SA cells after a
single exposure to doxorubicin (DOX), demonstrating
that chemotherapeutic drugs can lead to the production of
MDR cells [10, 11].
Analysis of the ABCB1 promoter and flanking
sequences has revealed that several elements including
the heat shock element and Y-box region, also found

Akt-mediated drug resistance after cisplatin administration
[16, 21, 22]. MK2206, a small molecule pan-Akt inhibitor,
has been evaluated in clinical trials to treat solid tumors,
and has been proven safe in humans, and orally effective
[16, 20, 23]. Inhibition of Akt activity by MK2206 prevents
cisplatin resistance in endometrial cancer cells and reverses
drug resistance in human melanoma cells [16, 24].
Multiple strategies to reverse P-gp-mediated MDR
have been investigated, including designing inhibitors to
block ATP-dependent P-gp activity to block efflux and
recover drug accumulation, as well as exploring small
molecules to reduce P-gp levels in MDR tumor cells
[25–28]. In this study, we investigated the regulation of
P-gp, GRP78, and p-Akt in human OS cells and their
DOX-resistant sublines, and we examined the generation
of DOX chemoresistance in vitro and in vivo.

of the established sublines (Figure 1D). The profiles
of OS resistant cells and OS parental sensitive cells,
including the IC50 values, the growth curves and the DOX
accumulation assay, are shown in Table 1 and Figure S1A
and S1B. Previous studies also demonstrated the resistant
profiles of MG-63 resistant subline [2, 29]. In addition, the
OS resistant sublines showed slight resistance to MK2206
compared with their parental cell lines (Table 1).

GRP78 silencing inhibits DOX-induced P-gp
expression in OS cells and their DOX-resistant
sublines
Interestingly, the levels of P-gp and GRP78 were
up-regulated after the DOX treatment. However, P-gp
does not directly associate with GRP78 [30]. To determine
whether GRP78 enhances the levels of P-gp in response
to DOX treatment, GRP78 knockdown was performed by
siRNA, and changes in P-gp expression were determined.
Significant increase of P-gp and p-Akt expression in OS
parental sensitive cell lines was observed with the induction
of 0.5 μM DOX while the resistant sublines responded to
1 μM DOX (data not shown). Thus, 1 μM DOX was used in
the entire study. After knockdown, GRP78 expression was
suppressed efficiently. P-gp levels were reduced moderately
in parental cells (Figure 2A–2C, lanes 1 and 5) and
significantly in DOX-resistant cells (Figure 2D–2F, lanes 1
and 5), in comparison with siRNA controls under normal
growth conditions. DOX treatment induced a continuous
increase in P-gp from 0 to 72 hr in parental sensitive cells
(Figure 2A–2C, lanes 1 to 4), but not in DOX-resistant
cells (Figure 2D–2F, lanes 1 to 4). P-gp levels were
significantly induced at 72 hr in DOX-resistant cells in
control (Figure 2D–2F, lane 4). Comparison of the effects
of the knockdown on each cell line showed that the loss
of GRP78 mildly inhibited P-gp expression during DOX
treatment (Figure 2A–2F, lanes 5 to 8).
Moreover, GRP78 knockdown resulted in a slight
decrease in constitutive Akt activity in parental and
DOX-resistant cells (Figure 2A–2F, lanes 1 and 5). After
incubation, DOX stimulated Akt phosphorylation within
24 hr, followed by increasing GRP78 levels at 48 hr in
MG-63/DOX cells in control, but not in U-2 OS/DOX
cells (Figure 2D–2F, lanes 1 to 4). During DOX treatment
of knockdown cells, Akt activity increased slightly
or rarely (Figure 2A–2F, lanes 5 to 8). These results
indicate that GRP78 contributes to Akt phosphorylation in
DOX-treated OS cells.

RESULTS
DOX up-regulates P-gp, GRP78, and p-Akt in
human OS cells in vitro and in vivo
To assess the effect of conventional chemotherapy
on the expression of ABCB1 and GRP78, we treated
cells with several chemotherapeutic drugs (as shown in
the Figure 1A) for 24 hr, and analyzed the ABCB1 and
GRP78 expression by quantitative real-time RT-PCR
(qRT-PCR). The expression changes of ABCB1 induced by
chemotherapeutic agents were similar to GRP78 in both
U-2 OS and MG-63 cells. DOX, cisplatin, docetaxel, and
vincristine, but not methotrexate or bleomycin stimulated
ABCB1 and GRP78 expression in U-2 OS cells. In
MG-63 cells, most of the conventional chemotherapeutic
drugs induced the expression of ABCB1 and GRP78.
DOX was selected for further research. Western
blot analysis (Figure 1B) showed that DOX induced
P-gp expression in a time-dependent manner. With DOX
treatment, U-2 OS cells showed increased Akt activity
after 24 hr and decreased activity after 48 hr, followed by
increased GRP78 levels at 48 hr and decreased levels at
72 hr after treatment. After 48 hr, DOX also significantly
induced GRP78 expression in MG-63 cells. Akt activity
was notably increased at 24 hr and then showed minimal
variation at 48 hr, but was markedly induced at 72 hr
subsequently in MG-63 cells. Thus, the observed
increase in Akt activity preceded the induction of GRP78
expression after 24 hr.
In an MG-63 xenograft mouse model,
immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed up-regulation of
P-gp, GRP78, and p-Akt at day 11 after the treatment; a
further increase was observed at the end of the treatment
(Figure 1C). To confirm these data in vitro, U-2 OS
and MG-63 DOX-resistant sublines were established
[2, 29]. P-gp, GRP78, p-Akt, and Akt protein levels
correlated with the concentration of DOX, which was
added to the culture medium to maintain the resistance

MK2206 inhibits DOX-induced P-gp expression
in parental sensitive cells and resistant sublines
To confirm the alteration of P-gp expression
associated with Akt activity, we used MK2206 to block Akt
activation. MK2206 at 50 nM and higher concentrations,
inhibits Akt phosphorylation (data not shown), and

may cover up the contribution of other factors to Akt
activity. In order to study the function of GRP78 in Akt
phosphorylation, 30 nM MK2206 was used. As expected,
MK2206 inhibited the DOX-induced P-gp up-regulation
in parental sensitive cells (Figure 3A, lanes 1 and 4), and
particularly in DOX-resistant cells (Figure 3B, lanes 1
and 4). This inhibition was more pronounced than in
GRP78 knockdown cells (Figure 2A–2F, lanes 5 and 8).
In the presence of MK2206, DOX barely increased the

P-gp levels in parental cells (Figure 3A) and in
DOX-resistant cells (Figure 3B).
In addition, Akt inhibition by MK2206 decreased
the GRP78 levels in parental and DOX-resistant OS cells
(Figure 3A and 3B, lanes 1 to 4). The expression of GRP78
in response to DOX was negative in U-2 OS, U-2 OS/DOX
and MG-63/DOX cells, but not in MG-63 cells (Figure 3A
and 3B, lanes 2 to 4). These data indicate that the DOXinduced GRP78 expression is regulated by Akt in OS cells.

found that with combined MK2206 and GRP78 inhibition,
DOX showed the most powerful cytotoxicity in parental OS
cells, particularly in DOX-resistant cells (data not shown).
Western blotting showed that the suppression of Akt activity
and GRP78 levels reduced P-gp expression after DOX
treatment for 48 hr in DOX-resistant OS cells (Figure 4H
and 4I, lanes 3 and 4). In parental sensitive OS cells, P-gp
expression was not changed between MK2206 alone and
the combined treatment of MK2206 and GRP78 inhibition
(Figure 4G and 4I, lanes 3 and 4). As expected, knockdown
of GRP78 had a weak effect on reducing P-gp levels after
DOX stimulation at 48 hr (Figure 4G–4I, lanes 3 and 4).
GRP78 suppression combined with MK2206
inhibited GRP78 levels and Akt activity more potently
than GRP78 suppression (Figure 4G and 4H, lanes 2
and 4) or MK2206 treatment (Figure 4G and 4H, lanes 3
and 4) alone. In addition, MK2206 not only inhibited
Akt activity, but also suppressed the DOX-induced
GRP78 expression (Figure 4G and 4H, lane3). These

We suppressed GRP78 prior to MK2206 incubation,
as GRP78 may be phosphorylated by Akt. GRP78
inhibition further potentiated the suppressive effect of
MK2206 on P-gp levels induced by DOX (Figure 4A–4F,
lanes 5 to 8) in comparison with MK2206 treatment alone
(Figure 4A–4F, lanes 1 to 4), particularly in DOX-resistant
OS cells (Figure 4D–4F, lanes 5 to 8).
Furthermore, Akt inhibition by MK2206 after
knockdown of GRP78 appeared to be the most effective
in reducing GRP78 levels and Akt phosphorylation
(Figure 4A–4F, lanes 1 and 5) and suppressed the
DOX-induced GRP78 expression and phospho-Akt levels
(Figure 4A–4F, lanes 5 to 8).
To investigate P-gp levels in three treatment
conditions, we selected the time point of 48 hr. At this
point, we not only tested the cytotoxicity of DOX but also

xenograft mouse model. As described in the Methods,
mice were treated for 21 days. As expected, mice treated
with DOX had reduced tumor weight and tumor volume
compared to control untreated mice (Figure 5D, blue
curve in the left panel, and Figure 5E, blue column)
or compared to mice treated with MK2206 alone
(Figure 5D, gray curve in the left panel, and Figure 5E,
gray column). Significant body weight reduction was
observed after DOX treatment (Figure 5D, blue curve
in the right panel) but not MK2206 (Figure 5D, gray
curve in the right panel). MK2206 combined with
shGRP78 enhanced the sensitivity of xenograft to
DOX. Mice treated with the triple combination had the
smallest tumor growth than the other treatment groups
(Figure 5D and 5E). Importantly, neither MK2206 nor
MK2206 combined with shGRP78 decreased the body
weight, indicating that toxicity originated mainly from
the DOX administration (Figure 5D, right panel). After
21 days, one mouse died after DOX single injection.
Together, these results indicate that the emergence of
DOX resistance is regulated partly by the activated Akt
and overexpressed GRP78. Combined inhibition of Akt
phosphorylation and GRP78 expression does not only
increase the DOX sensitivity of OS cells, but also slows
down the occurrence of resistance.

Combining GRP78 suppression with MK2206
alleviates DOX-induced drug resistance in vitro
and sensitizes OS cells to DOX in xenograft
mouse model
To understand the relationship between GRP78
expression and Akt activity in mediating resistance, OS
cells were treated with GRP78 shRNA and/or MK2206
and subjected to increasing DOX concentrations. After
8 months of DOX alone, U-2 OS and MG-63 cells with
or without shRNA control treatment grew steadily in the
presence of 100 nM DOX in a culture medium (Figure 5A,
black and gray curves). In contrast, OS cells cultured
with DOX combined with shGRP78 or MK2206 plus
shRNA control showed decreased resistance and were
unable to tolerate >100 nM DOX in the culture medium.
Specifically, the IC50 values were 65 and 42 nM DOX
for shGRP78, and MK2206 plus shCON in U-2 OS
cells, respectively, and 72 and 49 nM DOX for the same
conditions as above in MG-63 cells (Figure 5A, green and
brown curves). Notably, under shGRP78 plus MK2206
treatment, cells were more sensitive and did not proliferate
in the medium containing > 35 nM DOX (U-2 OS cells) or
> 40 nM DOX (MG-63 cells) (Figure 5A, orange curves).
The IC50 values of DOX correlated with the results in
Figure 5A. However, the cells treated with MK2206
were more resistant to MK2206 after 245 days incubation
(Figure 5B). Levels of P-gp, GRP78, p-Akt, and Akt were
increased after 245 days of DOX treatment (Figure 5C).
Not surprisingly, P-gp expression was not increased after
treatment with shGRP78 combined with MK2206.
To investigate the role of GRP78 and Akt in
developing DOX resistance in vivo, we used an MG-63

DISCUSSION
DOX, a topoisomerase II inhibitor that is widely
used in clinical treatments, is a substrate of P-gp in
drug-resistant OS cells [2, 29, 31]. Appropriate stimulation
by DOX increases Akt activity and activation of the UPR
process, such as the up-regulated GRP78 levels in our
study (Figure 1B and 1D). This activation facilitates
and maintains high levels of P-gp, particularly in the
DOX-resistant sublines (Figure 2D and 2E), and assists
the escape of OS cells from DOX-based chemotherapy.

Akt can be activated by phosphorylation at Ser473,
Thr308, or both [21, 32, 33]. However, to respond to
anticancer drugs, including topoisomerase I or II inhibitors
and microtubule stabilizers, Akt is phosphorylated at
Ser473 but not at Thr308 [21, 33]. Thus, after DOX
treatment, Akt is activated by phosphorylation at Ser473
in vitro and in vivo. The increased levels of phospho-Akt
parallel the enhanced resistance to DOX in OS cells. ABC
drug transporters are regulated by Akt-mediated signaling
[21]. In other cancers, activation of Akt signaling can
promote the development of drug-resistance through
up-regulation of Akt-dependent P-gp expression [21, 34].
In addition, Akt is critical for inducing and maintaining
GRP78 expression. Suppressing Akt activity prevents
drug-induced GRP78 response [16]. Hence, after Akt

activity is suppressed by a small-molecule pan-Akt
inhibitor, MK2206, both P-gp and GRP78 are blocked
(Figures 3 and 4, lanes 1 and 2). These findings suggest
that P-gp and GRP78 are downstream targets in the Akt
signaling, and that Akt acts as one of the major regulators
of P-gp and GRP78 expression. Furthermore, our study
not only demonstrates that Akt induces GRP78, but also
indicates that GRP78 activates Akt, which requires GRP78
for DOX response (Figure 2).
In addition, our analysis of the relationship
between P-gp and GRP78 shows that GRP78 induces
P-gp expression under DOX-stimulated condition. We
hypothesize that Akt mediates the P-gp induction, and
that GRP78 enhances the regulatory effect of Akt on P-gp
expression. If our assumption is true, the response of

P-gp levels to DOX may be negative or the weakest after
knockdown of GRP78 and treatment with MK2206. Our
findings suggest that P-gp levels show minimal increase,
particularly in DOX-resistant OS cells, during DOX
incubation in the absence of GRP78 and phospho-Akt
(Figure 4). Thus, under DOX stimulation, GRP78
promotes Akt phosphorylation and enhances Akt-mediated
P-gp expression. Given that OS resistant cells express
higher levels of P-gp than OS parental cells, we assume
that the basal levels of P-gp can be easily detected.
At present, studies of P-gp inhibitors focus on
three mechanisms: (i) inhibiting the drug binding site
either competitively, noncompetitively, or allosterically;
(ii) inhibiting ATP hydrolysis, which is required for P-gp
function; and (iii) influencing integrity of cell membrane
lipids [35, 36]. However, the factors determining the
selectivity of P-gp binding site have not been identified.
In addition, safety evaluation of P-gp inhibitors combined
with chemotherapeutic drugs would be undesired and not
possible to prediction [36–39]. Our analysis demonstrates
that the knockdown of GRP78 combined with MK2206
inhibits initial and DOX-induced P-gp levels, indicating
the indirectly reverse effect on drug resistance in OS cells
(Figure 4).
All three isoforms of Akt: Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3
show clear and distinguishable functions and locations
[40]. Current clinical trials on Akt inhibitors target all
three Akt isoforms. MK2206, an allosteric Akt inhibitor,
is a leading clinical candidate, which has shown only
moderate efficacy both alone and in combination with
other chemicals to date [41]. The developmental curves of
resistant OS cell lines indicate that OS cells treated with
shGRP78, MK2206, or both show resistance to DOX by
day 245 compared to day 0.
In summary, our study demonstrates that Akt and
GRP78 are two important regulators of DOX-induced
P-gp expression. We show for the first time that the
inhibition of Akt and GRP78 decreases the DOX-induced
P-gp expression, and alleviates the chemoresistance of OS
cells. Furthermore, our results indicate that GRP78 and
Akt mediate the sensitivity of OS cells to DOX, probably
by inhibiting the P-gp expression. Suppression of GRP78
offers a potential target and promotes the development of
specific antibody therapies targeting the GRP78 expression
in tumors, which can be treated with chemotherapeutic
drugs and Akt inhibitors.

in MEM (Life Technologies) in the presence of 10% heatinactivated FBS. All cell lines were incubated at 37°C in a
humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. U-2 OS/DOX
cells cultured in culture medium containing 100 or 300 nM
DOX were represented as U-2 OS/DOX 100 nM or U-2
OS/DOX 300 nM. MG-63/DOX cells maintained in the
medium involving 100 or 500 nM DOX were denoted by
MG-63/DOX 100 nM or MG-63/DOX 500 nM. In this
article, unless otherwise stated, U-2 OS/DOX 100 nM and
MG-63/DOX 100 nM are denoted by U-2 OS/DOX and
MG-63/DOX respectively. Cisplatin and docetaxel were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).
Vincristine, methotrexate, and bleomycin were obtained
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. MK-2206 was purchased
from BioVision Incorporated (Milpitas, CA, USA). DOX
(hydrochloride) was obtained from Cayman Chemical
Company (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). GRP78 shRNA lentiviral
particles (sc-44261-V, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) is a
pool of concentrated, transduction-ready viral particles
containing 3 target-specific constructs that encode
19–25 nt shRNA designed to knock down gene expression;
control shRNA (sc-108080, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) is
recommended by Santa Cruz Biotechnology as a negative
control for GRP78 knockdown.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Protein levels were analyzed by Western blotting as
described previously [2]. Specifically, 18 μg of membrane
protein samples and 38 μg of total protein samples were
extracted and separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate–
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The primary antibodies
for P-gp, GRP78, Akt and phosphorylated (Ser473)-Akt
(p-Akt) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology
(Danvers, MA, USA) and used at 1:1000 dilution.

qRT-PCR
qRT-PCR was performed as previously described
[2, 29]. The sequences of primers used were as follows:
ABCB1, 5′-AGAGTCAAGGAGCATGGCAC-3′ (sense)
and 5′-ACAGTCAGAGTTCACTGGCG-3′ (antisense);
GRP78, 5′-GAACGTCTGATTGGCGATGC-3′ (sense)
and 5′-ACCACCTTGAACGGCAAGAA-3′ (antisense);
and GAPDH, 5′-GAAAGCCTGCCGGTGACTAA-3′
(sense) and 5′-AGGAAAAGCATCACCCGGAG-3′
(antisense).

Western blot analysis

Cell culture and reagents
Human OS cell lines U-2 OS and MG-63 were
purchased from the Typical Culture Preservation

USA) and administered by oral gavage thrice a week.
DOX (hydrochloride) was administered by intraperitoneal
injection with the dose of 2 mg/kg once every 4 days.
The control group was treated with 30% Captisol by oral
gavage thrice a week. Tumor growth was measured with
calipers every other day, and tumor volume was calculated
using the following formula: volume (mm3) = length ×
width2 × 0.5. After 21 days, the animals were anesthetized
with 1.5% isofluorane-air mixture and killed by cervical
dislocation. Xenografts were then removed and weighed.

For Western blot detection, cells were transfected
transiently with siRNA as previously described [2, 16].
The sequence of siGRP78 is 5′-ggagcgcauugauacuagatt-3′
and siCon is 5′-aaggagacguauagcaacggu-3′. Transfection
was performed using the Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent
(Life Technologies) in U-2 OS and U-2 OS/DOX cells
and the Super Electroporator NEPA21 system (NEPA
GENE, Ichikawa-City, Chiba, Japan) in MG-63 and MG63/DOX cells. Briefly, 1 × 106 U-2 OS or U-2 OS/DOX
cells were seeded in each well of six-well plates. On the
next day, 75 pmol siRNA oligos mixed with 7.5  μL of
Lipofectamine 2000 reagent and 485 μL of Opti-MEM
(Life Technologies) were transfected into cells. Media
were replaced after 4 hr. In MG-63 or MG-63/DOX cells,
the Super Electroporator NEPA21 system was used.
One million cells suspended in 90 μL Opti-MEM were
transfected using 10 μL Opti-MEM containing 150 pmol
siRNA oligos. After transfection, cells were transferred
into six-well plates and allowed to adhere.
To develop DOX-resistant OS cell lines, 0.5 × 105
cells were plated per well in a 12-well plate. Twelve hours
later, cells were pretreated with 1 mL of complete media in
the presence of 5 μg/mL Polybrene (sc-134220, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) for 5-min. Subsequently, cells were treated
with shRNA lentiviral particles for GRP78 (15 μL/well
containing 7.5 × 104 infectious units of virus (IFU)) and
control (15 μL/well containing 7.5 × 104 IFU). Fresh
media without Polybrene were placed on each infected
well after 24 hr.
For Knockdown of GRP78 in tumor xenograft
experiments, MG-63 cells were infected with the lentiviral
constructs as described above. The stable clones were
selected as previously described [42]. ShRNA knockdown
efficiency of in vitro and in vivo experiments was shown
in Figure 5A and 5E.

IHC
IHC staining analysis was performed as previously
described [43, 44]. The slides were incubated overnight
at 4°C with antibodies at a dilution of 1:800 for MDR1/
ABCB1 (P-gp), 1:200 for BiP (GRP78), and 1:50 for
Phospho-Akt (Ser 473) (all from Cell Signaling
Technology). The following staining procedure was
performed at 37°C for 60 min with secondary streptavidinhorseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). Image-Pro Plus 6.0 Software (Media
Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA) was used to analyze
the expression of proteins.

Development of DOX-resistant OS cell lines
To evaluate the effect of GRP78 inhibition and
MK2206 on preventing the development of DOX
resistance, we seeded U-2 OS or MG-63 cells into 12-well
culture plates at 0.5 × 105 cells per well overnight. Three
parallel wells in each group were treated simultaneously.
Subsequently, cells were transfected with the lentiviral
constructs as described above. Fresh media were placed on
each infected well after 24 hr, and cells were treated with
DOX and/or 30 nM MK2206. The initial concentration
of DOX was 5 nM. When cell growth reached 90%
confluence, cells were harvested and reseeded at a density
of 0.5 × 105 cells/well, and the DOX concentration
increased [45].

Tumor xenografts
All animal experiments were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of China
Pharmaceutical University. Four-week old nude female
mice (BALB/c, nu/nu) were purchased from the Slac
Laboratory Animal of Chinese Academy of Science
(Shanghai, China). Three million MG-63 cells were
stably transfected with shGRP78, or control lentiviral
particles were suspended in 1:2 PBS/Matrigel (BD
Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) in a total volume of
200 μL and subcutaneously injected into the right forelimb
of each mouse. When the mean tumor volume reached
approximately 100 mm3, 30 mice were randomized into
five groups (n = 6/group) with approximately equivalent
tumor volumes between groups. In accordance with
the in vitro experiment, the minimum effective dose of
MK2206 (60 mg/kg) was used [20]. In brief, MK2206
was formulated in 30% Captisol (Cydex, La Jolla, CA,

Statistics
All quantitative results were expressed as
mean ± SD of the data from at least three experiments
conducted in a parallel manner. Statistical analysis was
performed using GraphPad Prism 5 software.
