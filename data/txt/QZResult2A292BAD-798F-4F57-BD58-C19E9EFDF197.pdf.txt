ABSTRACT
OLA1 is an Obg family P-loop NTPase that possesses both GTP- and ATPhydrolyzing activities. Here we report that OLA1 is a GSK3β interacting protein,
and through its ATPase activity, inhibits the GSK3β-mediated activation of protein
serine/threonine phosphatase 1 (PP1). It is hypothesized that GSK3β phosphorylates
inhibitor 2 (I-2) of PP1 at Thr-72 and activates the PP1 · I-2 complex, which in
turn dephosphorylates and stimulates GSK3β, thus forming a positive feedback
loop. We revealed that the positive feedback loop is normally suppressed by OLA1,
and becomes over-activated under OLA1 deficiency, resulting in increased cellular
PP1 activity and dephosphorylation of multiple Ser/Thr phosphoproteins, and more
strikingly, decreased global protein threonine phosphorylation. Furthermore, using
xenograft models of colon cancer (H116) and ovarian cancer (SKOV3), we established
a correlation among downregulation of OLA1, over-activation of the positive feedback
loop as indicated by under-phosphorylation of I-2, and more aggressive tumor growth.
This study provides the first evidence for the existence of a GSK3β-I-2-PP1 positive
feedback loop in human cancer cells, and identifies OLA1 as an endogenous suppressor
of this signaling motif.

loops between kinases and phosphatases are less well
documented except for two proposed examples: the Cdc2/
Cyclin B kinase complex-mediated positive feedback loop
that activates the Cdc25 phosphatase and promotes mitotic
entry [9], and the GSK3β-protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)
positive feedback loop [10][11].
GSK3 is a multifunctional protein serine/threonine
kinase with ~100 protein substrates [12] that regulates
diverse signaling pathways, ranging from glucose
metabolism and protein synthesis to proliferation,
differentiation, and survival [13][14]. For most of its
substrates, phosphorylation by GSK3β leads to functional
inhibition. On the other hand, PP1 is a major protein Ser/
Thr phosphatase that mediates the dephosphorylation of
~100 substrates, including those involved in regulating
the cell cycle, metabolism, cell survival, and apoptosis

INTRODUCTION
Reversible protein phosphorylation, mediated by
the opposing actions of protein kinases and phosphatases,
is a fundamental mechanism for cell signaling involved
in almost all cellular activities, and deregulation of this
mechanism can cause pathological conditions, such as
cancer [1–3]. Cell signaling systems consist of not only
linear pathways but also complex networks within and
between pathways in the forms of signaling cascades and
feedback loops [4, 5]. Notable kinase cascades include
the PI3K/Akt and MAP kinase pathways [6, 7], whereas
feedback loops are best known for the phosphatasemediated negative feedback regulation of kinase cascades,
for example, the deactivation of MAP kinases by the dualspecificity phosphatase [8]. However, positive feedback

[15, 16]. The catalytic subunit of PP1 (PP1c, or simply
PP1) is regulated by two types of regulatory subunits:
the inhibitory subunits that include inhibitor-1 (I-1) and
inhibitor-2 (I-2), and the targeting subunits that bring PP1c
to a specific substrate. In the cytosol I-2 forms a complex
with PP1 [17]. This PP1·I-2 complex was initially
named ATP-Mg-dependent phosphatase, because it can
be reactivated by a kinase (FA, later renamed GSK3) in
the presence of ATP and Mg [18]. GSK3 phosphorylates
I-2 at Thr-72 and triggers conformational changes in the
complex [19]. Interestingly, as demonstrated by Zhang
et al., the GSK3β-activated PP1·I-2 complex could
dephosphorylate GSK3β itself at Ser-9, resulting in a
more active kinase [10]. This positive feedback loop
between GSK3β and PP1 was further recognized by
Szatmari et al. in rat forebrain neurons [11]. However, the
detailed mechanisms that regulate this positive feedback
loop, particularly a suppressive mechanism, are not fully
understood. Without a suppressor, a positive feedback
loop would eventually turn into an “on” switch [20]. To
date, the GSK3β-PP1 positive feedback loop has not been
elucidated in any cancer models, and it is currently unclear
how it contributes to the cancer cell signaling network.
We report here the identification of a new
endogenous regulator of the GSK3β-PP1 positive
feedback loop: the Obg-like ATPase 1 [OLA1
(ENSG00000138430)]. OLA1 belongs to the Obg family
and YchF subfamily of P-loop GTPases [21–23]. The
OLA1/YchF proteins are highly conserved from bacteria to
humans, and unlike other Obg family members, they bind
and hydrolyze both ATP and GTP [24, 25][26]. We have
previously demonstrated that OLA1 plays an important
role in regulating multiple stress responses including
oxidative stress [27] and heat shock [28]. More recently,
we revealed that OLA1 suppresses protein synthesis
and enhances the integrated stress response (ISR) by
interacting with eIF2 and interfering with the formation of
the eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAi ternary complex [26]. In OLA1knockdown (OLA1-KD) human breast cancer cells, the
ISR signaling in response to cellular stresses is attenuated,
as evidenced by reduced expression of ATF4, a surrogate
marker of ISR [29], and hypophosphorylation of eIF2α.
Interestingly, in the harvested OLA1-KD tumor tissues,
we also observed over-activation of GSK3β, as reflected
by decreased GSK3β phosphorylation at Ser-9 (GSK3β-p)
and diminished expression of Snail, a downstream target
of GSK3β. Hence we hypothesize that OLA1 may
have a more profound involvement in protein Ser/Thr
phosphorylation and/or dephosphorylation. Indeed, in the
present study, OLA1 was found to bind GSK3β and block
its phosphorylation of I-2, thus inhibiting the GSK3βPP1 positive feedback loop. Therefore, downregulation
of OLA1 leads to increased activity of PP1, decreased
Ser/Thr phosphorylation in multiple phosphoproteins,
and even more dramatically, increased dephosphorylation
on a global scale. Moreover, our data suggest that the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

over-activation of the positive feedback loop is associated
with I-2 dephosphorylation, and with a more aggressive
tumor growth phenotype.

RESULTS
OLA1-knockdown cancer cells grow into larger
tumors in two xenograft models.
We recently reported that knockdown of OLA1 in
breast cancer cells (MDA-MB231) reduces apoptosis
without affecting proliferation, resulting in enhanced
late-stage tumor growth [26]. In order to investigate the
role of OLA1 in other cancer models, we established two
new lines of OLA1-KD cells from the parental colorectal
carcinoma (H116) and ovarian carcinoma (SKOV3) lines
by stably expressing OLA1-specific shRNA (shOLA1),
as well as the corresponding control shRNA transfected
(shCTL) lines. When cultured in vitro, the OLA1KD cells had a slightly lower rate of growth than the
control cells (Figure S1). However, when inoculated
into immunodeficient mice (SCID), OLA1-KD tumors
of both H116 and SKOV3 origins showed significantly
increased growth compared to the control tumors that
were inoculated on the other side of the back of the same
animal (Figure 1A). The average weight of the OLA1KD H116 and SKOV3 tumors at harvest were 1.98 and
1.95 fold heavier than the control tumors, respectively.
The harvested tumor tissues were analyzed by
immunoblotting (IB) for possible molecular alterations.
OLA1-KD tumors in the H116 colon cancer model
showed markedly decreased eIF2α at Ser-51 (eIF2α-p)
and reduced GSK3β-p, indicating hypoactive ISR and
hyperactive GSK3 signaling (Figure 1B). Furthermore,
in the OLA1-KD SKOV3 tumors, we found diminished
expression of CHOP (a proapoptotic factor downstream
of the ISR pathway) and reduced levels of cleaved PARP
(an apoptotic marker), but no significant changes in
PCNA (a proliferative marker). These data, in line with
the previous report [26], confirmed that downregulation
of OLA1 in human cancer cells enhances tumor growth
in vivo and this effect is associated with decreased
intratumoral apoptosis, attenuated ISR, and hyperactive
GSK3β.

OLA1 regulates serine/threonine
phosphorylation in multiple phosphoproteins
To explore whether OLA1 has a widespread
role in protein phosphorylation through a mechanism
independent of its interaction with eIF2 [26], we
investigated protein phosphorylation in response to
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in two OLA1-KD
cell lines (H116 and SKOV3). As shown in Figure 2A,
tunicamycin (TM) induced eIF2α-p and expression of
ATF4 in control H116 cells over time, however, the effect

was weaker in OLA1-KD cells. At 3 h of treatment, the
level of ATF4 in shOLA1 cells was ~60% that of the
control cells. Conversely, when the OLA1 levels were
reconstituted in KD cells by transfection of an RNAiresistant OLA1 cDNA construct, the “rescued” cells
showed largely improved eIF2α-p and ATF4 induction.
Next, GSK3β-p was evaluated. While there was no
time-dependent phosphorylation of GSK3β because

it is not a direct component of ISR, GSK3β-p was
generally lower in OLA1-KD cells at all time-points
than in CTL cells and recovered with OLA1 restoration
(Figure 2A). Dephosphorylation of GSK3β-p indicates
an active state of the kinase. When I-2, a substrate of
GSK3β [19], was examined, OLA1-KD cells showed a
substantially hypophosphorylated Thr-72 (Figure 2A).
We also examined eIF2α, GSK3β, and I-2 in the second

quantification was conducted using the NIH ImageJ software.

cancer line (SKOV3), and obtained the same results:
they were all under-phosphorylated in the OLA1-KD
cells as compared with the control cells (Figure S2).
Moreover, we tested Pin1 (peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans
isomerase) phosphorylation at residue Ser-16, which is
not believed to be phosphorylated by GSK3β [30], [12].
Surprisingly, Pin1-p was also hypophosphorylated in the
OLA1-KD H116 cells. We hence questioned if Ser/Thr
residue hypophosphorylation was a global phenomenon
in these cells. Using an antibody that recognizes universal
threonine site phosphorylation, we confirmed that OLA1KD cells globally exhibited lower Thr-p than both CTL
cells (p < 0.01, for each time point) and OLA1-rescued
cells (p < 0.01) (Figure 2B). Taken together, we believe

that OLA1 regulates Ser/Thr phosphorylation of many
proteins including and beyond eIF2α and GSK3β.

OLA1-knockdown results in increased PP1
activity
The observed decrease in Ser/Thr phosphorylation
of multiple proteins in OLA1-KD cells indicates that
OLA1 may function to modulate the activities of kinases
and/or phosphatases. OLA1 may interact with many
kinases, phosphatases, or substrates individually. However,
in the present study we focus on testing whether OLA1
acts through a unique molecular mechanism that triggers
a shift of balance between Ser/Thr phosphorylation and
dephosphorylation. Among the tested phosphoproteins

control red fluorescent protein (RFP) (Figure 4C). A
subsequent quantitative assay using equal concentrations
(250 nM) of proteins confirmed that WT and ΔTGS
inhibited GSK3 activity significantly, but N230A and
RFP did not (Figure 4D). Third, OLA1 was able to block
the GSK3-mediated reactivation of PP1 (Figure 4E).
In the PP1 reactivation assay, recombinant GSK3 was
added to the previously formed PP1-I-2 complex in the
presence of Mg2+ and ATP, leading to a ~40% increase
in PP1 activity. Co-addition of OLA1 WT and ΔTGS
proteins resulted in a total and partial blockage of the
PP1 reactivation, respectively, whereas addition of
N230A and RFP proteins showed no effect. These data
strongly suggest that OLA1’s inhibition of PP1 is a result
of its inhibition of GSK3’s phosphorylation of I-2 and
reactivation of PP1, and this OLA1 activity requires a
functional ATPase domain. Finally, using a 32P-γ-ATPbased ATPase assay, we confirmed that WT OLA1 protein
possessed ATP hydrolyzing activity, whereas the ΔTGS
and N230A proteins had a partial and total loss of the
activity, respectively (Figure 4F).

(Figure 2A), eIF2α (Ser-51), GSK3β (Ser-9) [31], and I-2
(Thr-72) are confirmed substrates of protein phosphatase
1 (PP1) [32], and Pin1 (Ser-16) is a putative substrate for
either PP1 or protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) because
Pin1-p is responsive to PP1/PP2A inhibitor Calyculin A
(CA) [33]. Therefore, we questioned whether the OLA1KD cells have increased PP1/PP2A activities. Because
protein levels of PP1c were comparable between the
control and OLA1-KD cells (Figure 2A), a malachite
green-based PP1 assay was employed to measure the
enzymatic activity [34]. As shown in Figure 3, The PP1
enzymatic activity from the total cell lysate of OLA1-KD
H116 cells was 43% higher than that in CTL cell lysate,
whereas the total Ser/Thr phosphatase activity showed no
significant difference (Figure 3A). Further, PP1 protein
was immunoprecipitated (IP) from the total cell lysates
and subjected to the enzymatic assay. IP product from
OLA1-KD cells was found to contain 48% more PP1
activity than that from the control cells (Figure 3B).
Additionally, a pair of mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF)
lines carrying Ola1+/+ or −/− alleles was tested for their
basal PP1 activities. Again, the knockout MEF showed
a 48% increase in PP1 activity (Figure 3C). Finally, we
analyzed SKOV3 xenograft tumor tissues and found that
in 3 of 4 pairs PP1 was more active in the OLA1-KD
tumor than the CTL tumor (Figure 3D).

OLA1 serves as a suppressor of the GSK3β-I-2PP1 positive feedback loop
A consequence of the reactivation of PP1 is the
dephosphorylation of GSK3β, which further activates PP1.
To demonstrate such a positive feedback loop, H116 cells
were treated with protein phosphatase inhibitors [Okadaic
acid (Oka) for PP2A, and CA for both PP2A and PP1], or
a GSK3-specific inhibitor (CHIR-99021), and the resulting
effects were evaluated with IB. As shown in Figure 5, both
CHIR and CA inhibited GSK3β activity, as evidenced by
the accumulation of its substrate β-catenin, whereas both
inhibitors promoted the phosphorylation of eIF2α and I-2,
indicating a suppressed PP1 (Figure 5A). Inhibition of
PP2A alone (by 2 nM Oka), however, did not inhibit or
activate PP1 or GSK3β. These inhibitor studies revealed
the intrinsic linkage between PP1 and GSK3β activities,
supporting the presence of a GSK3β-I-2-PP1 positive
feedback loop. Moreover, we attempted to interpret a
seemingly paradoxical effect of the feedback loop on
I-2-p (Figure 5A) that was encountered in previous reports
[10][11]: inhibition of either GSK3β or PP1 results in
similarly increased Thr-72-p. In an in vitro system merely
comprised of PP1, I-2, and GSK3, addition of CHIR could
largely prevent the phosphorylation of Thr-72 (Figure
5B, Lane 5). Considering Thr-72 can be phosphorylated
in vivo by other kinases including ERK1/2, MAPK,
and CDKs [36], we reconstituted another system that
included MAPK. CHIR instead promoted the formation
of Thr-72-p in the presence of MAPK (Figure 5B Lane
6). Putting together these in vitro analyses and cell-based
observations (Figures 2–4), we believe that Thr-72-p is
an unambiguous indicator of the overall activity of the
feedback loop, i.e., an increased Thr-72-p indicates the

OLA1 binds with GSK3β and inhibits the GSK3mediated reactivation of PP1
To interpret why OLA1-KD cells had increased
cellular PP1 activity, we first tested whether OLA1
could directly inhibit PP1. In a simple in vitro protein
phosphatase assay, human OLA1 protein failed to alter
the dephosphorylation activity of the recombinant PP1c
(Figure 4A, Lanes 1–2). OLA1 also did not enhance or
suppress the inhibition of PP1 by I-1 or I-2 (Lanes 3–8).
Because the purified inactive PP1 · I-2 complex can be
reactivated by GSK3 through phosphorylation of I-2 [18]
[19], and a recent high-throughput affinity purification
study indicated OLA1 as a GSK3β-associated protein
[35], we investigated a possible role of OLA1 in GSK3mediated PP1 reactivation. First, following IP of the
ectopically expressed OLA1 in HEK293T cells, IB
analysis showed that OLA1 indeed interacts with GSK3β,
but not with I-1 or I-2 (Figure 4B). Second, recombinant
OLA1 wild-type protein (WT) was found to inhibit the
GSK3-induced phosphorylation of I-2 in a dose-response
manner (Figure 4C). In the same assay, two mutant forms
of the recombinant OLA1 protein were also tested: one
containing a point mutation at the G4 motif of the G
domain that abolishes nucleotide-binding (N230A) and
the other a truncated protein with a deleted C-terminal
TGS domain (ΔTGS). As compared with the WT, the
ΔTGS showed slightly less inhibition of GSK3, whereas
N230A nearly lost all inhibitory activity, similar to the

suppression of both GSK3β and PP1, and vice versa. To
confirm this, we measured Thr-72-p of I-2 in the Ola1−/−
MEFs that had shown increased PP1 activity (Figure 3C),
and found they were deficient compared to the Ola1+/+
cells (Figure 6A).
Next, we investigated the role of OLA1 in the
regulation of the GSK3β-I-2-PP1 positive feedback loop
in H116 cells. The CTL and OLA1-KD cells were treated
with various concentrations of CHIR and subjected to IB
analysis to observe possible alterations of the positive
feedback loop. As expected, the treatment induced Thr72-p in both CTL and OLA1-KD cells in a dose-dependent
manner. However, the OLA1-KD cells showed a severely
attenuated phosphorylation response, indicating a sustained
positive feedback loop, while the CTL cells did not (Figure
5C). Similarly, compared with the CTL cells, the OLA1KD cells exhibited less β-catenin accumulation, indicating
an increased resistance to GSK3 inhibition. These

results suggest that OLA1 may function as a suppressor
of the GSK3β-I-2-PP1 loop, and knockdown of OLA1
simultaneously confers increased PP1 and GSK3β activity.
Finally, tissue samples collected from three
xenograft experiments were examined for I-2
phosphorylation, including the colon cancer (H116)
and ovarian cancer (SKOV3) raised in the present study
(Figure 1) and the previously established breast cancer
(MDA-MB231) [26]. In all there three models, the OLA1KD tumors showed significantly less I-2-p than the control
tumors (Figure 6A–6B). These data suggest that OLA1
downregulation causes a hyperactive GSK3β-I-2-PP1
positive feedback loop in vivo.

DISCUSSION
This study shows the first direct evidence for
the existence of a GSK3β-PP1 positive feedback loop

in a cancer signaling network, and presents a novel
endogenous suppressor of that loop, OLA1. Our initial
goal was to define the mechanisms underlying OLA1
KD-promoted tumor growth, which was initially
discovered in a breast cancer model [26]. With the
addition of two new cancer models, H116 colon cancer
and SKOV3 ovarian cancer (Figure 1), we conclude that
OLA1 plays a general inhibitory role in tumor growth in
vivo while it has no effect or a slightly positive effect on
cell growth in vitro [26] (Figure S1). Our interpretation
is that the advanced tumor growth under OLA1-KD is
not due to a change in cell proliferation, but a result of
decreased apoptosis in response to intratumoral stresses,

associated with attenuated ISR and reduced expression
of CHOP (Figure 1B). More importantly, these studies
suggested that OLA1 has another function: regulation of
protein Ser/Thr phosphorylation (Figures 2–3).
We show that multiple specific phosphoproteins
from
ISRand
non-ISR
pathways
were
hypophosphorylated in OLA1-KD cells, including
eIF2α, GSK3β, I-2, and Pin1 (Figure 2A), and protein
threonine phosphorylation was also globally decreased
(Figure 2B). Conversely, when OLA1 expression was
restored in OLA1-KD cells, phosphorylation of these
sites recovered. In the literature, global changes in
protein phosphorylation or dephosphorylation activity

Based on our cell-based inhibitor tests and in vitro
reconstitution assays (Figure 5), we propose here a
positive feedback loop that consists of PP1, its inhibitor
I-2, GSK3β, the kinase that inhibits the inhibitor,
and additionally, an intrinsic suppressor for the entire
loop – OLA1 (Figure 6C). When OLA1 is downregulated,
this GSK3β-I-2-PP1 loop would stimulate the activities
of both PP1 and GSK3β, resulting in a net decrease in
protein Ser/Thr phosphorylation (Figure 2). From the
viewpoint of stress-response dynamics, these cells may
exhibit a right shift of the stimulation-phosphorylation
curve, indicating a general desensitization [41]. This
desensitization state is consistent with the previously
observed attenuation of ISR [26]. Together, they provide
a more comprehensive explanation, at the cell-signaling
level, for the phenotypes demonstrated in OLA1-KD
cells, including increased resistance to multiple cellular
stresses [26], accelerated adhesion [42], decreased cell
migration [43], and decreased apoptosis during tumor
growth in vivo.
In our studies, we compared OLA1-KD cancer
cells to control cells without comparison to any
noncancerous cells. Therefore, the role of OLA1 or the
positive feedback loop in oncogenic transformation is
unknown. When several human cancers were compared
to their normal tissue counterparts, OLA1 mRNA was
actually increased in ≥50% of samples [44]. Based on
analyses of 160 cases of breast cancer, we found that
cancers with lower OLA1 protein expression have a

have been documented, though rarely. Reactive oxygen
species have been shown to mediate a suppression of
both protein tyrosine phosphatases and protein Ser/
Thr phosphatases (PSP), accompanied by increased
global protein phosphorylation, in skeletal muscle [37]
and melanoma cells [38]. In contrast, in fibroblast cells
infection of human cytomegalovirus mediates a rapid
increase of cellular PSP [34]. In the present study, we
show for the first time that knockdown or knockout of
a P-loop NTPase (OLA1) causes imbalance of global
protein Ser/Thr phosphorylation, by promoting the
activity of PP1 (Figure 3).
To our surprise, OLA1 regulates PP1 activity not
by directly inhibiting the phosphatase but by binding to
GSK3β and blocking its phosphorylation of I-2 (Figure 4).
Using reconstituted PP1 · I-2 complex, we confirmed that
OLA1 inhibits the GSK3-mediated reactivation of the
complex (Figure 4E). Previous studies have shown that
GSK3 activity can be inhibited by proteins, such as the
Wnt canonical pathway co-receptor LRP6 [39] and the
A-kinase anchoring protein family member GSK3β
interaction protein (GSKIP) [40], which binds and
blocks GSK3 from phosphorylating its substrates. OLA1
represents a new class of GSK3 inhibitor that requires
ATPase activity (Figure 4C, 4F). A simple assumption
is that OLA1 competes with GSK3 for ATP and thus
interferes with the phosphorylation reaction. Since only
one substrate (I-2) was tested in our in vitro assays, it is
unknown whether OLA1 generally inhibits GSK3 activity.

show linked changes of PP1 and GSK3β activities. Cells were treated with PP1 inhibitor Okadaic acid (OKA; 0.2 nM for 1 hour), PP1/
PP2A inhibitor Calyculin A (CA; 2 μM for 0.5 hours) or GSK3-specific inhibitor CHIR-99021 (10 μM for 4 hours) and subjected to IB
analysis with the indicated antibodies. Phosphorylation of eIF2α (Ser51) indicates the decreased activity of PP1, whereas the accumulation of
β-catenin indicates the attenuation of GSK3β activity. β-actin was used as a loading control. B. In vitro I-2 phosphorylation assay explaining
the hyper-phosphorylation of I-2 in response to both GSK3β and PP1 inhibitors. I-2 can be phosphorylated by both GSK3β (lane 2) and
MAPK (lane 3) to form I-2-p, which can be dephosphorylated by PP1 (lane 4). This induction of I-2-p by CHIR (lane 6 vs. lane 4) is MAPKdependent (lane 5 vs lane 6). A protein phosphatase inhibitor can restore the I-2-p (lane 7 vs. lane 4). C. Effect of OLA1 on the GSK3-I-2-PP1
positive feedback loop. H116 cells stably transfected with the control (CTL) and OLA1 shRNA (OLA1-KD) were treated with CHIR at the
indicated concentrations for 6 hours and subsequently subjected to IB analysis with the indicated antibodies. Note that induction of I-2-p is
less effective in the OLA1-KD cells than the CTL cells, and β-catenin accumulation is also attenuated in OLA1-KD cells.

worse prognosis than cancers with higher OLA1 levels,
indicating that OLA1 plays a negative role in cancer
progression rather than tumorigenesis [26]. Among the
components of the positive feedback loop, GSK3β has
been intensively studied for its role as either a tumor
suppressor or promoter depending on the type of tumor
[45]. GSK3 inhibitors have shown promising results
in several preclinical anti-cancer studies [13]. It will
be interesting to examine whether the effect of GSK
inhibitors is linked to their function in interrupting the
GSK3β-I-2-PP1 loop.
Another
paradox
exists
regarding
I-2
phosphorylation: increased GSK3β activity should
produce more I-2-p; however, simultaneously, the
activated PP1 should deplete I-2-p. We explored
this using different in vitro and in vivo systems, and
determined that I-2-p inversely correlates with the
overall activity of the feedback loop (Figures 5–6).

Because I-2 is a subunit of the PP1 holoenzyme,
reactivated PP1 could instantly auto-dephosphorylate
its I-2 subunit [46]. However, I-2 phosphorylation
by GSK3β is a relatively transient event [19]. More
importantly, of the three xenograft models tested (breast,
colon, and ovarian), I-2-p was consistently lower in
the OLA1-KD tumors (Figure 6A–6B). Therefore,
low I-2-p may serve as an indicator of an activated
GSK3β-PP1 positive feedback loop associated with a
more aggressive growth phenotype. In summary, this
report describes a novel role of OLA1 (an NTPase) in
regulating the interplay between GSK3β (a kinase) and
PP1 (a phosphatase), and reveals that OLA1 regulates
the balance of protein Ser/Thr phosphorylation and
dephosphorylation by suppressing the GSK3β-I-2-PP1
positive feedback loop, a novel signaling motif in the
cancer signaling network.

Figure 6. Hypophosphorylation of I-2 (Thr-72) is indicative of an activated GSK3-I-2-PP1 positive feedback loop in vitro
and in vivo. A. Immunoblot analysis of I-2 (Thr-72) phosphorylation level in Ola1+/+ and Ola1−/− MEF cells (top) and xenograft tumors

derived from shCTL and shOLA1 cell lines of H116, SKOV3, and MB231 origins (bottom 3). B. Densitometric analysis of immunoblots
shown in A. Data are presented as means of the ratios of I-2-p/total I-2 ± SD. Fold change in means between the control and knockdown
groups, as well as p values (two-tail Student’s t-test), are indicated for each bar graph. C. Model of the GSK3β-I-2-PP1 signaling circuit.
PP1 (the catalytic subunit) is inhibited by its inhibitory subunit I-2; the complex can be reactivated through phosphorylation of I-2 by GSK3,
and activated PP1 in turn dephosphorylates I-2 and GSK3, further promoting GSK3 activity. OLA1 functions as a suppressor of this loop.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

5’-AAATACCTCGAGGCAAATA-3’ without changing
the encoded amino acid sequence.

Cell culture

Immunoblot analysis and IP

Human colon cancer cell line H116 and human
ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3 were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). H116 cells
were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Thermo Scientific,
Waltham, MA), 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 mg/ml
streptomycin, and SKOV3 cells were cultured in McCoy’s
5A medium (Lonza, Walkersville, MD) supplemented
with the same. Immortalized MEF lines were generated as
previously described [29]. Cells were cultured at 37°C in
a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.

Immunoblot analysis was performed according to
our standard procedures as described in earlier studies
[27, 28]. For IP of FLAG-tagged proteins, anti-FLAG M2
magnetic beads (Sigma-Aldrich) were used according to
the manufacturer’s instructions as described [28].

In vivo tumor growth models
The animal experiments were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the
Houston Methodist Research Institute. Female FoxChase
SCID mice (beige, (CB17.Cg-Prkdc(scid)Lyst(bg-J)/
Crl) purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN) at ages of
8-10 weeks were used, with one group for the SKOV3
ovarian cancer model (n = 12) and another for H116
colon cancer (n = 9). To inoculate xenograft tumors,
1×107 shCTL and 1×107 shOLA1 cells were injected
subcutaneously into the left and right back of each animal,
bilaterally. Tumor growth was monitored twice a week.
The tumor size was calculated by (L×W2)/2 where L is the
longer axis of the measurements and W is the shorter axis.

Antibodies, proteins and reagents
Antibodies against Phospho-GSK3β (Ser-9),
GSK-3β, PP1c, β-catenin, Phospho-eIF2α(Ser-51),
eIF2α, ATF4, CHOP, PCNA, and Phospho-threonine
(P-Thr) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology (Danvers, MA). Phospho-I-2 (Thr72-p) and Phospho-Pin1 (Ser-16) antibodies were
obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). I-2 and Pin1
(total protein) antibodies were from R&D systems
(Minneapolis, MN) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Dallas, TX), respectively. Anti-OLA1 and anti-β-actin
antibodies were from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO).
Peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies, including antimouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG were from GE Healthcare
(Pittsburgh, PA). Recombinant protein used in this
study including I-2, PP1, and GSK-3 were purchased
from New England BioLabs (Ipswich, MA). Active
GSK3β was obtained from SignalChem (Richmond,
BC, Canada). Recombinant HIS-tagged OLA1 proteins
including OLA1-WT (NM_013341.3, 396 aa), OLA1N230A, and OLA1-ΔTGS were custom-made by
Epoch Life Science (Missouri City, TX). Okadaic acid
and Calyculin A were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
GSK3 inhibitor CHIR99021 from Calbiochem (EMD
Millipore, Billerica, MA), and I-1 from Upstate (EMD
Millipore).

Phosphatase activity assays
For determination of endogenous PP1 activity,
cultured cells or tumor tissue homogenates were
extracted with phosphatase lysis buffer [47] containing
20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet
P-40, 1 mM EGTA, 30 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2
μg/ml aprotinin for 10 minutes at 4°C, and then subjected
to centrifugation at 100,000×g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
The resulting supernatant was passed through Sephadex
G-25 (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA) columns twice by
low-speed centrifugation (600×g, 5 minutes) to eliminate
ATP and intracellular free phosphate. Total protein
concentration of the phosphate-free cell extracts was
determined using the Pierce BCA protein assay reagent.
Activity of serine/threonine phosphatases was measured
using a Malachite Green Phosphate Detection Solution
(EMD Millipore) to detect the release of phosphate from
a phosphopeptide substrate (RRA(pT)VA) [34]. PP1specific activity can be calculated by including Oka (20
or 0.2 nM) in the assay, which distinguishes between PP1
and PP2A activities.
For in vitro PP1 assay, 20 units/ml of PP1 was
incubated with 200 mM substrate 6,8-difluoro-4methylumbelliferyl phosphate (DiFMUP, Invitrogen) in
reaction buffer (50 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM
MnCl2, 2 mM DTT, 0.01% Brij-35) in the presence or
absence of OLA1 or control proteins. The reaction product

Cell transfection
Stable OLA1-KD cell lines were established using
SMARTvector lentiviral shRNA particles (Thermo
Scientific) as described in the previous report [26]. To
reconstitute OLA1 expression, the OLA1-knockdown
cells were transiently transfected with an OLA1rescue vector (FLAG-OLA1-res) [26], in which the
nucleotide sequence corresponding to the OLA1-shRNA
(5’-AAGTATCTGGAAGCGAACA-3’) was modified to

In vitro PP1 inhibition and reactivation assay

GRANT SUPPORT

The PP1•I-2 complexes were prepared according to
a previously described procedure [46]. Briefly, 20 U/ml
PP1 prepared in the presence of Mn2+ was incubated with
20 mg/ml recombinant rabbit I-2 for 30–40 min at room
temperature. The PP1•I-2 complexes were reactivated by
addition of recombinant GSK-3 or p42 MAP kinase, with
or without co-addition of an OLA1 or control protein. The
reactions typically contained 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5,
0.1 mM EDTA, 0.125 mM ATP, 1.25 mM magnesium
acetate, and 2 mg/ml GSK-3β or 1 mg/ml MAPK, and
were incubated at 30°C for 10 min. The reaction mixtures
were subjected to either the DiFMUP-mediated PP1 assay
described above, or immunoblot analysis for levels of I-2-p.

This work was supported by NIH grant
R01CA155069 (Z.-Z.S.), HMRI Cornerstone Award (Z.Z.S.), and the Oshman Fund for Ovarian Cancer (Z.-Z.S.).

ATPase assay
To determine the ATP hydrolyzing activities of
OLA1, 1 μM protein was incubated with [g-32P]ATP (3.3
nM, 0.5 μCi) in the presence of 100 μM of the unlabeled
nucleotide in a 50 μl reaction buffer (25 mM HEPES-KOH
pH 7.5, 80 mM potassium acetate, 2.5 mM magnesium
acetate, 1 mM DTT) at 35°C. After 30 min, the reaction
was stopped by the addition of 200 μl activated charcoal
suspension (100 mg/ml Norit A® charcoal (SigmaAldrich) in 1N HCL). After centrifugation twice at
100,000×g, release of [32P] phosphate in the supernatant
was measured by scintillation counting.
