Itraconazole Inhibits Angiogenesis and Tumor Growth in
Non–Small Cell Lung Cancer
Blake T. Aftab, Irina Dobromilskaya, Jun O. Liu, and Charles M. Rudin

Abstract
The antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab has been approved for the treatment of non–small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC), although the survival benefit associated with this agent is marginal, and toxicities and cost are
substantial. A recent screen for selective inhibitors of endothelial cell proliferation identified the oral antifungal
drug itraconazole as a novel agent with potential antiangiogenic activity. In this article, we define and
characterize the antiangiogenic and anticancer activities of itraconazole in relevant preclinical models of
angiogenesis and lung cancer. Itraconazole consistently showed potent, specific, and dose-dependent inhibition
of endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation in response to both VEGF- and basic fibroblast
growth factor–mediated angiogenic stimulation. In vivo, using primary xenograft models of human NSCLC, oral
itraconazole showed single-agent growth-inhibitory activity associated with induction of tumor hypoxiainducible factor 1 alpha expression and marked inhibition of tumor vascularity. Itraconazole significantly
enhanced the antitumor efficacy of the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin in the same model systems. Taken
together, these data suggest that itraconazole has potent and selective inhibitory activity against multiple key
aspects of tumor-associated angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo, and strongly support clinical translation of its use.
Based on these observations, we have initiated a randomized phase II study comparing the efficacy of standard
cytotoxic therapy with or without daily oral itraconazole in patients with recurrent metastatic NSCLC.

Introduction
Angiogenesis, the summation of multiple cellular and biologic processes culminating in the propagation of blood
vessels, has been the subject of extensive examination in
the context of tumor biology over the past 4 decades since
it was first proposed by Judah Folkman in 1971 (1). Solid
tumor growth and progression is dependent on tumor-associated angiogenesis. Tumor expression and circulating levels
of angiogenic factors have been correlated with aggressive
tumor growth, predilection for metastasis, and prognosis in a
wide array of solid tumors, including lung cancer (2–4).
Although many putative regulators of angiogenesis have been
identified, 2 secreted factors, VEGF and basic fibroblast
growth factor (bFGF), have been, in particular, strongly implicated in tumor-associated angiogenesis (5). VEGF and
bFGF interact with distinct families of tyrosine kinase recep-

tors (RTK) on the surface of endothelial cells and activate
multiple downstream signaling pathways. Together, these
pathways promote endothelial cell survival, proliferation,
migration, invasion, and tube formation, resulting in the
formation of new vascular networks (6, 7).
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in both
men and women in the United States (8). The only antiangiogenic therapy currently approved for use in lung cancer is the
a-VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab. A landmark
phase III clinical study, ECOG 4599, randomized patients with
advanced non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to a standard
chemotherapy doublet with or without bevacizumab (9). This
study showed a statistically significant improvement in both
progression-free and overall survival rates in favor of the
bevacizumab-containing arm. There are, however, major limitations to the clinical utility of bevacizumab. The absolute
improvements in progression-free and overall survival rates in
this study were modest (1.7 and 2 months, respectively). Due
to episodes of fatal hemoptysis in a previous study (10),
enrollment was restricted to patients with nonsquamous
tumors, with no history of hemoptysis, with no brain metastases, with no indication for use of anticoagulants, and with
good performance status. However, even in this carefully
selected subpopulation, bevacizumab use was associated with
increased treatment-related deaths (P ¼ 0.001) including 5
episodes of fatal hemoptysis (vs. 0 in the control arm), and
with significantly increased rates of hypertension, proteinuria,
bleeding, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia,

Itraconazole in Lung Cancer

hyponatremia, rash, and headache (P < 0.05 for each of these
factors). Across disease types, bevacizumab use has been
associated with increased treatment-related mortality (11).
The financial cost of bevacizumab, given its limited efficacy
and significant toxicity, was seen by many as excessive, at
upwards of $500,000 per year of life gained (12, 13). A final
concern comes from what was intended as a "confirmatory"
trial, the Avastin in Lung (AVAiL) study, which randomized a
similar patient population to a different standard chemotherapy doublet with or without bevacizumab (14). This study
failed to show a statistically significant difference in survival.
In summary, although evidence is strong that angiogenesis is
critical to tumor growth and progression, there is a need for
less toxic, less cost-prohibitive, and more effective therapies.
These observations strongly support further development of
novel antiangiogenic strategies for patients with lung cancer.
Itraconazole is an orally bioavailable, Food and Drug
Administration Agency–approved agent belonging to the
family of azole antifungal drugs that inhibit the enzyme
lanosterol 14a-demethylase, which is responsible for the
conversions of lanosterol to ergosterol in fungi and lanosterol
to cholesterol in humans, respectively. Initially reported by
Chong and colleagues, itraconazole has been identified as a
potent inhibitor of endothelial cell proliferation and Matrigelstimulated angiogenesis, with inhibition of lanosterol 14ademethylase and sterol biosynthesis only partially explaining
this novel antiproliferative activity (15). Further efforts to
characterize the mechanism of inhibition of endothelial cell
proliferation are ongoing, with recent reports suggesting
perturbation of cholesterol-trafficking pathways imparted
by itraconazole as a possible mechanism contributing to this
activity (16). Notably, itraconazole has also recently been
implicated as an antagonist of the hedgehog signaling pathway in models of hedgehog pathway deregulation (17).
Preclinical evaluation of the antiangiogenic capacity of
itraconazole in relevant in vitro models of angiogenesis and
in vivo models of cancer are clearly required to determine the
viability of pursuing further clinical development of itraconazole as an antiangiogenic agent.
Tumor cell lines implanted into immunodeficient mice
comprise the most commonly used platform for in vivo
preclinical cancer therapeutic testing. However, ex vivo derivation of stable cell lines in tissue culture is associated with
profound changes in cellular morphology, growth characteristics, chromosome structure, gene copy number, and gene
expression (18–20), changes which are not reversed by reintroduction of cell lines into mice (21). In sharp contrast to the
harsh biologic conditions in which tumors naturally arise,
typical tissue culture conditions include relatively high oxygen
tension, high glucose concentration, and low hydrostatic and
oncotic pressures. These are precisely the conditions in which
maintenance of angiogenic drive, in particular, is not relevant.
To evaluate the in vivo effects of itraconazole, in the present
study we employed an alternative approach based on primary
lung cancer xenografts. The primary xenograft model depends
on immediate transfer of human cancers from patients into
recipient mice, without intervening tissue culture or cell line
derivation ex vivo. We have previously reported that gene

www.aacrjournals.org

expression profiles of lung cancer primary xenografts more
closely reflect those of the human cancers than do profiles of
cell lines derived from the same parental tumor when reimplanted as standard (secondary) xenografts (21). These
observations are supported by data from other investigators
exploring primary xenografts (22, 23).
In this article, we describe the results of a series of in vitro
and in vivo analyses evaluating the putative antiangiogenic
activities of itraconazole. We employed several in vitro assays
using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) to
separately probe specific hallmarks of endothelial cell function
as they relate to angiogenic processes. These functional
competencies include proliferative capacity, migration, chemotactic potential, and the ability to spontaneously form an
extracellular matrix (ECM)-supported tube network. The
capacity of itraconazole to modulate these functions was
explored in the presence of multiple angiogenic stimuli including VEGF and bFGF. We further investigate the in vivo
activity of itraconazole as an inhibitor of tumor-associated
angiogenesis and of tumor growth, both as a single agent and
in combination with standard cytotoxic chemotherapy. These
studies offer the first assessment of the efficacy of itraconazole
as an antiangiogenic agent and as an anticancer therapeutic in
a primary disease model.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents
HUVECs (Lonza) were grown in endothelial cell growth
medium-2 (EGM-2; Lonza) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Cells were washed with PBS and serum-starved
in endothelial cell basal medium-2 (basal media; Lonza)
supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma)
for 4 to 6 hours before assays. NSCLC cell lines, NCI-H358, NCIH1838, NCI-H596, and NCI-H1975 were obtained from the
American Type Cell Culture (ATCC) and cultured in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% FBS according to the ATCC's
recommendations. Cultures from LX-7 and LX-14 tumors were
derived from preparations of single-cell suspensions grown in
Media-2 plus 4.5 g/L glucose (RPMI-1640 supplemented with
10% FBS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate,
10 mmol/L HEPES buffer, and 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate).
Cultures were incubated at 37o C with 95% air/5% CO2 in a
humidified incubator, unless otherwise stated. Itraconazole
was obtained from Sigma and prepared as a solution in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for use in in vitro experiments.
Itraconazole oral solution (Sporanox; Ortho Biotech) and
cisplatin (APP Pharmaceuticals) for in vivo experiments were
obtained from the pharmacy of The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center and diluted as required with 40%
hydroxypropyl-cyclodextrin, 2.5% propylene glycol, pH 4.5,
in water and saline, respectively.
Proliferation assays
HUVECs were suspended in either EGM-2 or basal media
containing 0.5% BSA and supplemented with 10 ng/mL VEGFA or 12 ng/mL bFGF. NCI-H358, NCI-H1838, NCI-H596, NCIH1975, LX-7, and LX-14 cells were suspended in respective

RPMI-1640–based media. Cells were seeded at a density of 1 to
5  103 cells per well and allowed to attach for 6 hours. Cells
were then exposed to vehicle or drug treatment and incubated
for 48 hours. Duplicate plates containing NCI-H358, NCIH1838, and NCI-H596 cells were also cultured under hypoxic
conditions generated by flushing a modular incubator chamber with a 95% N2/5% CO2 preanalyzed air supply to generate a
stable atmosphere of 1.5% O2. Relative cell numbers following
incubation were quantified by CellTiter 96 AQueous One
Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega) as per the
manufacturer's recommendations using a SpectraMax M2e
spectrophotometer and SoftMax Pro software (Molecular
Devices).
Phospho-RTK analysis
HUVECs were cultured on 10-cm culture-treated dishes in
EGM-2 medium and treated with vehicle or itraconazole for 24
hours. Cells were then harvested using a cell scraper and
pelleted by centrifugation (300g). Cells were then resuspended and lysed in modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer [150 mmol/L NaCl, 50 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4),
1% NP-40, 0.25% Na-deoxycholate, 1 mmol/L ethylene diamine
tetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF), 1 mmol/L Na-orthovanadate, 1 mmol/L NaF, 1
Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktails 1 and 2 (P2850 and P5726,
respectively; Sigma), and 1 Protease Inhibitor Cocktail
(P8340; Sigma)], followed by centrifugation, yielding clarified
lysates. Total protein content was quantified using Bradford
assay. Lysates were analyzed using Proteome Profiler Human
Phospho-RTK Array (R&D Systems) as per the manufacturer's
recommendations using 100 mg total protein.
Migration assays
Transwell cell migration assay. EGM-2, or basal media,
containing 0.5% BSA supplemented with 10 ng/mL VEGF-A or
12 ng/mL bFGF was added to the lower wells of a CytoSelect
Fluorometric 8 mmol/L Transwell Migration Assay plate (Cell
Biolabs). Cells were suspended in basal media supplemented
with 0.5% BSA and added to the upper wells of the plate and
exposed to vehicle or drug treatment followed by incubation
for 16 hours to allow for migration across the porous membrane. Cells remaining in the upper wells were then voided.
Migratory cells were detached from the lower face of the
Transwell membrane and lysed. Total DNA in the resulting
lysates was stained using CyQuant GR dye (Millipore) and
quantified by fluorometric analysis as per the manufacturer's
recommendations.
Oris cell migration assay. HUVECs were plated at 95%
confluency in Oris Cell Migration Assay plates (Platypus
Technologies) and incubated overnight to allow cell attachment. Wells were rinsed with PBS and incubated in basal
media for 6 hours. Stopper inserts were then removed to reveal
a migration zone that was 2 mm in diameter and cells were
again rinsed in PBS and followed by exposure to EGM-2 media
containing itraconazole (0–3 mmol/L), or basal media supplemented with 0.5% BSA. Assay plates were incubated for 24
hours to permit cell migration. Following migration, cells were
labeled with 2 mg/mL calcein-AM for 30 minutes and visual-

ized using an Olympus BX61 fluorescence microscope with
images captured using an affixed CCD camera and Slidebook 5
software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations). Migration was
quantified using ImageJ software (NIH) to measure the area
of the migration zone remaining after migration and reported
as the percentage decrease in migration zone area from the
commencement of the migration period.
Tube formation assay
Wells of an assay plate were coated with growth factor–
reduced basal membrane extract (Geltrex; Invitrogen) and
were incubated for 30 minutes at 37 C. HUVECs were then
suspended in either EGM-2 or basal media containing 0.5%
BSA supplemented with 12 ng/mL VEGF or 10 ng/mL bFGF
and seeded at 1.5  104 cells per well. Cells were exposed to
treatment followed by 16 hours incubation. Cells and resulting
tube networks were visualized after 30 minutes of incubation
with 2 mg/mL Calcein AM using an Olympus BX61 fluorescence microscope.
NSCLC primary xenograft models
The primary NSCLC xenograft models LX-14 and LX-7,
representing squamous cell and adenocarcinoma histologies, respectively, were derived from primary tumor tissue
obtained from treatment-naïve patients at the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center. Briefly, tumor cells
isolated from bronchoscopic biopsy specimens were prepared into single-cell suspensions, mixed with Matrigel in
equal volume, and injected as a subcutaneous bolus into
nonobese diabetic (NOD)/severe combined immunodeficient mice (SCID) mice. Primary xenograft tumors were
maintained solely in immunocompromised mice by serial
passage. Tumor sections of primary xenografts were formalin-fixed, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin
at various passages to verify that they consistently maintained NSCLC histologic characteristics. Tissues were characterized for KRAS and EGFR mutations, EML4–ALK
translocation, and cMET amplification by the Molecular
Pathology Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University (Supplementary Table S1).
Freshly isolated primary xenograft tumors were mechanically dissociated into single-cell suspensions; 2.5  106 viable
cells were suspended in equal volumes of PBS and Matrigel
and implanted subcutaneously in adult homozygous NOD/
SCID mice (Charles River Laboratories). After tumors reached
a size measuring 150 mm3, calculated as V ¼ L  W2/2, mice
were treated with either vehicle control, itraconazole (75 mg/kg
oral twice daily), cisplatin (4 mg/kg intraperitoneally every 7
days), or a combination of itraconazole and cisplatin. All
treatments were administered in 10 mL/kg volumes with
12-hour separation between bi-daily treatments.
Statistical analyses were carried out for each primary
xenograft separately. Initial tumor volume measurements
are summarized using means, SEM, and ranges. Growth
patterns were summarized graphically by plotting the mean
and SEM for each treatment group over time. Treatment
groups were analyzed by 2-tailed paired Student t test, with
a P < 0.05 considered statistically significant.

Itraconazole in Lung Cancer

Immunoblot analyses
Tumors were harvested 4 hours after the last dose following
a 14-day treatment in tumor-bearing mice. Tumors were
mechanically homogenized in 1:11 (w/v) modified RIPA buffer.
Clarified lystates were then generated by centrifugation of
crude lysates. The total protein content was quantified by
Bradford assay and equally pooled by treatment group. Pooled
lysates were mixed with lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer
(Invitrogen), heated to 70 C for 5 minutes, and resolved by
electrophoresis on a 4% to 12% Bis–Tris NuPage Gel (Invitrogen). Protein was then electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked
using 5% condensed milk in Tris-buffered saline containing
0.2% Tween 20. Primary goat polyclonal antibodies to hypoxiainducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1a; sc-8711) and b-actin (sc-1615;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used at a final dilution of
1:100 and 1:500, respectively. The secondary horseradish peroxidase-linked bovine anti-goat IgG antibody (sc-2352; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) was used at a dilution of 1:1,000. Immunodetection was carried out using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL), and autoradiographs were scanned using a GS800 calibrated densitometer and analyzed using Quantity One
software (BioRad).

EGM-2 media (containing these and multiple additional
growth factors), with approximate IC50 [95% confidence interval (CI)] values of 588 (553–624), 689 (662–717), 691 (649–
733), and 628 (585–672) nmol/L, respectively (Fig. 1A; the
Dunn test not significant for differences in these values).
Because this effect was observed both with VEGF and bFGF,
we examined whether itraconazole exposure altered the activity state of the receptors primarily implicated in VEGF- and
bFGF-mediated angiogenesis. Analysis of phospho-tyrosine
levels on receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) in HUVECs cultured
in EGM-2 revealed dose-dependent decreases specifically in
phospho-VEGFR2 and phospho-FGFR3 levels (Fig. 1B). None
of the other RTKs present on the array were similarly affected.
Together, these data show that itraconazole has inhibitory
effects on multiple primary angiogenic pathways.
To assess the relative specificity of the inhibitory activity
of itraconazole on endothelial cells, versus possible direct
effects on tumor cell growth, the antiproliferative effects of
itraconazole were examined in a panel of NSCLC cell lines
representing a variety of genetically and phenotypically
distinct lung cancer subtypes. In these NSCLC cell lines,
itraconazole had no appreciable effect on proliferation below the maximum tested concentration of 100 mmol/L. To

Assessment of tumor vascular area
Nuclei of perivascular cells associated with perfusion-competent tumor vessels were detected by in vivo perfusion of
Hoescht 33342 (HOE), as previously reported (24, 25). Briefly,
animals were injected intravenously with 15 mg/kg HOE saline
solution in a 10 mL/kg volume 4 hours after the last dose.
Animals were euthanized by cervical dislocation 1.5 minutes
after injection. Tumors were then harvested and frozen in
Tissue Tek O.C.T. compound (Sakura Finetek). Tumors were
serially sectioned with 6-mm thickness, mounted on Superfrost
glass slides (Fisher) and allowed to air dry overnight. Tumor
sections were then scanned and HOE staining of perivascular
nuclei visualized under 10 objective on an Olympus BX61
fluorescence microscope affixed with an automated stage
using Slidebook 5 software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations)
to generate whole-section montage images. Tumor images
were processed using ImageJ software by applying a threshold
across all tumor images to generate binary representations of
HOE-positive perivascular signal with hole filling used to
approximate perfused vessel area (24). Perfused vessel area
was then quantified as a percentage of total tumor area for
each tumor sample, and mean vessel area  SEM is reported
as a percentage of total tumor area for each treatment group.

Results
Itraconazole inhibits HUVEC proliferation but has no
direct antiproliferative effects on NSCLC cells
We initially sought to confirm the inhibitory activity of
itraconazole on endothelial cell proliferation and to evaluate
the specificity of this effect for distinct angiogenic stimuli.
Itraconazole showed equipotent, dose-dependent inhibition
of HUVECs in all growth factor-stimulated conditions tested,
including stimulation with VEGF, bFGF, bFGF/VEGF, or

detection. Each RTK is spotted in duplicate with signal normalized to
phospho-tyrosine internal controls.

mimic effects under varying oxygen tension, as might be
seen in tumor cells in vivo, the assays were repeated under
hypoxic culture conditions, again revealing no change in
proliferation at concentrations less than 100 mmol/L of
itraconazole (Supplementary Table S1).
Itraconazole potently inhibits HUVEC migration and
chemotaxis
Endothelial cell migration is an essential process in angiogenesis and is functionally distinct from proliferation (26, 27).
Migration is regulated by multiple chemotactic stimuli, resulting in the activation of signaling pathways that mediate
cytoskeletal remodeling. We explored the effects of itraconazole on endothelial cell migration across stimulus gradients
using a Boyden chamber assay. HUVEC migration was also
assessed in a modified wound-healing assay.
The Boyden chamber assay was employed to assess chemotactic potential of HUVECs across gradients of angiogenic factors. Itraconazole inhibited VEGF-stimulated, bFGFstimulated, and EGM-2-stimulated HUVEC migration in a
dose-dependent manner, with similar potencies to those
shown in the endothelial proliferation assays described
above (Fig. 2A). In addition, itraconazole markedly inhibited
migration of HUVECs under non-gradient stimulation with
EGM-2, as assessed in the modified wound-healing assay
(Fig. 2B and C).

Itraconazole potently inhibits HUVEC tube formation
Beyond simple endothelial cell proliferation and chemotactic migration, neovascularization is dependent on angiogenic
stimuli driving formation and organization of tubular networks, that is, a capillary bed, requiring breakdown and
restructuring of extracellular connective tissue. This capacity
for formation of invasive and complex capillary networks can
be modeled ex vivo with the provision of ECM components as
a growth substrate, promoting spontaneous formation of a
highly cross-linked network of HUVEC-lined tubes (28). We
utilized this model to further define dose-dependent effects of
itraconazole in response to VEGF, bFGF, and EGM-2 stimuli.
In this assay, itraconazole inhibited tube network formation in
a dose-dependent manner across all stimulating culture conditions tested and exhibited similar degree of potency for
inhibition as shown in HUVEC proliferation and migration
assays (Fig. 3).
Itraconazole inhibits growth of NSCLC primary
xenografts as a single agent and in combination with
cisplatin therapy
The effects of itraconazole on NSCLC tumor growth were
examined in the LX-14 and LX-7 primary xenograft models,
representing a squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, respectively. NOD/SCID mice harboring established progressive tumors treated with 75 mg/kg itraconazole twice

Figure 3. Itraconazole inhibits EGM-2-, VEGF-, and bFGF-stimulated
HUVEC tube formation. HUVECs stimulated with EGM-2, 10 ng/mL VEGF,
or 12 ng/mL bFGF were allowed to spontaneously form tube networks

Unstimulated (basal media) HUVECs served as the negative control. The
resulting networks were visualized with calcein-AM.

daily showed significant decreases in tumor growth rate in
both LX-14 and LX-7 xenografts (Fig. 4A and B). Single-agent
therapy with itraconazole in LX-14 and LX-7 resulted in 72%
and 79% inhibition of tumor growth, respectively, as compared with vehicle-treated tumors over 14 days of treatment
(P < 0.001). Addition of itraconazole to a 4-mg/kg every
7 days cisplatin regimen significantly enhanced efficacy in
these models when compared with therapy involving cisplatin
alone. Cisplatin monotherapy resulted in 75% and 48% inhibition of tumor growth in LX-14 and LX-7 tumors, respectively,
compared with the vehicle-treatment group (P < 0.001),
whereas addition of itraconazole to this regimen resulted in
a respective 97% and 95% tumor growth inhibition (P  0.001
compared with either single agent alone) over the same
treatment period. The effect of combination therapy was quite
durable: LX-14 tumor growth rate associated with a 24-day
treatment period of cisplatin monotherapy decreased by 79%
with the addition of itraconazole (P < 0.001), with near
maximal inhibition of tumor growth associated with combination therapy maintained throughout the duration of
treatment.
Itraconazole treatment increases tumor HIF1a and
decreases tumor vascular area in NSCLC xenografts
Markers of hypoxia and vascularity were assessed in LX14
and LX-7 xenograft tissue obtained from treated tumor-bearing mice. Probing of tumor lysates by immunoblot indicated
elevated levels of HIF1a protein in tumors from animals
treated with itraconazole, whereas tumors from animals
receiving cisplatin remained largely unchanged relative to

www.aacrjournals.org

vehicle treatment (Fig. 4C and D). HIF1a levels associated
with itraconazole monotherapy and in combination with
cisplatin were 1.7- and 2.3-fold higher, respectively in LX-14
tumors, and 3.2- and 4-fold higher, respectively in LX-7
tumors, compared with vehicle treatment. In contrast, tumor
lysates from mice receiving cisplatin monotherapy showed
HIF1a expression levels equivalent to 0.8- and 0.9-fold that
seen in vehicle-treated LX-14 and LX-7 tumors, respectively.
To further interrogate the antiangiogenic effects of itraconazole on lung cancer tumors in vivo, we directly analyzed
tumor vascular perfusion by intravenous pulse administration
of HOE dye immediately before euthanasia and tumor resection. This procedure allows for assessment of functional
vasculature based on fluorescent dye delivery to and concentration in perivascular nuclei. Analysis of perfused tumor
sections by fluorescence microscopy showed significant reduction of tumor microvessel density associated with itraconazole therapy in both LX-14 and LX-7 primary xenografts
(Fig. 5). Vehicle-treated tumors showed 14.9% and 21.9% mean
tumor vascular area for LX-14 and LX-7 xenografts, respectively, whereas itraconazole monotherapy resulted in reduction of mean tumor vascular area to 5.8% (P < 0.001) and 9.7%
(P < 0.001) in LX-14 and LX-7 tumors, respectively. Addition of
itraconazole to a cisplatin regimen resulted in a similarly
significant reduction in tumor vasculature, with LX-14 showing a decrease in mean tumor vascular area from 11.2% to 6.1%
(P < 0.001) and LX-7 showing a decrease from 20.8% to 10.3%
(P < 0.001) tumor vascular area.

Discussion
Cancer-associated angiogenesis is a critical component of
solid tumor establishment, growth, and spread, and remains a
primary target of anticancer drug development (29). Antiangiogenic therapies to date have primarily focused on 2
approaches: (i) monoclonal antibodies or antibody derivatives
that bind and sequester tumor-derived soluble endothelial
growth factors or that inhibit ligand interaction with specific
endothelial receptors; and (ii) small-molecule RTKs with
specificity for endothelial receptors including VEGFR2 and
FGFR3 (30). These strategies typically have a narrow focus,
specifically targeting one of the most critical defined pathways
of angiogenic stimulation. These novel drugs exemplify a
broader ascendancy of rationally designed targeted therapeutic drug development as the predominant focus of therapeutic
cancer research over the past 2 decades.
Narrowly targeted therapeutic strategies, the so-called
"smart bombs" for cancer, are conceptually attractive in terms
of selectively targeting tumor growth and survival pathways
while limiting off-target toxicities. It is becoming clear that, for
complex biologic processes such as cancer cell growth and
angiogenic drive, focused inhibition of a critical node in a
single signaling axis, although it is the predominant signaling
axis, invites emergence of resistance pathways. In lung cancer,
most notably, targeting the driver mutation in EGFR-mutant
NSCLC can lead to dramatic initial responses in advanced
disease, but is essentially never curative (31). Secondary
mutations of EGFR itself (32), upregulation of alternative RTKs

Figure 4. Itraconazole inhibits growth of NSCLC primary xenografts, with itraconazole-treated tumors showing increased expression of HIF1a. A, mice bearing
established LX-7 tumors were treated with vehicle (n ¼ 9), oral itraconazole 75 mg/kg twice daily (ITRA; n ¼ 9), cisplatin 4 mg/kg intraperitoneally
every 7 days (CDDP; n ¼ 9), or a combination of itraconazole and cisplatin (ITRA þ CDDP; n ¼ 8). Mean  SEM tumor volumes are reported for each treatment

such as c-MET (33, 34), constitutive activation of downstream
pathways such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt
(35, 36), as well as a large-scale shift in gene expression and
morphology known as epithelial–mesenchymal transition (37,
38) have all been implicated as mechanisms of acquired
resistance. These and similar observations have led to an
ongoing debate about whether highly selective inhibitors or
multi-targeted inhibitors will ultimately be more effective, and
more durably effective, drugs.
Itraconazole as an antiangiogenic agent appears to fall into
the latter category, that is, an inhibitor that coordinately
affects multiple angiogenic stimulatory pathways. In this
study, we evaluated the influence of itraconazole on multiple
aspects of endothelial cell function that contribute to angiogenic potential. In assays of HUVEC proliferation, itraconazole
consistently showed potent antiproliferative activity in cultures stimulated with a variety of growth factor conditions,
including independent stimulation by VEGF and by bFGF
alone. Although affecting multiple endothelial responses to
multiple angiogenic stimuli, the proliferative inhibition of
itraconazole appears reasonably cell-type–specific, because
much higher concentrations had essentially no effect on
the proliferative capacity of 5 representative NSCLC cell lines,
including cultures derived from 2 primary xenograft models.
Probing of phosphorylation and activation status of RTKs
revealed that itraconazole has the capacity to inhibit activation of VEGFR2 and FGFR3, 2 critical receptors primarily
responsible for angiogenic response to these stimuli. Notably,

6770

alteration of VEGFR2 and FGFR3 phosphorylation states does
not appear to be directly related to the previously noted effects
of itraconazole on cholesterol trafficking and mTOR pathway
inhibition (16). The mechanism(s) responsible for this targeted receptor inhibition has not been fully defined, and is the
subject of ongoing analyses in our laboratories. These effects
on multiple key drivers of angiogenesis may be important to
the consistent inhibitory effects on multiple downstream
angiogenic functions.
Beyond proliferation, endothelial cell migration, directional
chemotaxis, and complex tube formation are all critical, and
distinct, functional components of tumor-associated angiogenesis. Itraconazole potently inhibited each of these functional competencies as indicated by MTS, wound-healing,
Boyden chamber, and tube formation assays. Extending these
analyses in vivo, itraconazole showed marked tumor growth
inhibition in our primary xenograft models of squamous cell
and adenocarcinoid NSCLC. When administered in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy, itraconazole contributed to
a durable cytostatic tumor growth response. These in vivo
effects appeared to be consistent with a potent antiangiogenic
effect, associated with significant inhibition of angiogenic
biomarkers, most notably intratumoral induction of the hypoxia-responsive gene, HIF1a, and depletion of perfusion-competent tumor vasculature. Taken together, these in vitro and in
vivo analyses support the hypothesis that itraconazole inhibits
angiogenic potential across all models tested and shows
intriguing efficacy in the first evaluation of this agent alone

and in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy in a preclinical primary cancer model.
Angiogenesis is an essential contributor to the growth and
spread of solid tumors. Few antiangiogenic agents have
shown improved outcomes in randomized phase III trials,
including only 1 such agent in lung cancer patients studied
to date. The benefits provided by bevacizumab in lung
cancer represent an important proof of principle; however,
these benefits are typically modest, improving survival by a
few weeks in patients treated with first-line chemotherapy.
The lack of antiangiogenic therapeutic options and limitations associated with bevacizumab therapy contribute to the
need for development and evaluation of additional angiogenesis targeting agents, including agents with mechanisms
of action distinct from the several monoclonal antibodies
and RTKs currently competing in this space. Itraconazole is
an orally bioavailable, well-tolerated, widely available offpatent medication that has a well-characterized safety profile in thousands of patients. The initial findings described
here have important clinical implications for potential use of
itraconazole as a novel antiangiogenic agent and strongly
support both further investigation of the molecular mechanisms of action of this drug in endothelial cells, and clinical
investigation in patients with lung cancer and other solid

tumors. Based on these several considerations, we have
recently initiated a randomized phase II clinical trial randomizing patients with advanced recurrent NSCLC to standard chemotherapy with or without oral itraconazole.
