Abstract
Several microRNAs have been implicated in human breast cancer but none to date have been validated or
utilized consistently in clinical management. MicroRNA-301 (miR-301) overexpression has been implicated as a
negative prognostic indicator in lymph node negative (LNN) invasive ductal breast cancer, but its potential
functional impact has not been determined. Here we report that in breast cancer cells, miR-301 attenuation
decreased cell proliferation, clonogenicity, migration, invasion, tamoxifen resistance, tumor growth, and
microvessel density, establishing an important oncogenic role for this gene. Algorithm-based and experimental
strategies identified FOXF2, BBC3, PTEN, and COL2A1 as candidate miR-301 targets, all of which were verified as
direct targets through luciferase reporter assays. We noted that miR-301 is located in an intron of the SKA2 gene
which is responsible for kinetochore assembly, and both genes were found to be coexpressed in primary breast
cancer samples. In summary, our findings define miR-301 as a crucial oncogene in human breast cancer that acts
through multiple pathways and mechanisms to promote nodal or distant relapses. Cancer Res; 71(8); 2926–37.

Introduction
Since the initial discovery of microRNAs (miRNA) in 1993
(1), they have been shown to influence multiple cellular
processes (2), and in particular, have been shown to play
important roles in cancer development and progression (3, 4).
The majority of miRNAs map to fragile genomic sites, and
aberrant patterns of miRNA expression have been observed in
multiple cancer types, including leukemias and lymphomas
(5), colon (6), hepatocellular (7), head and neck (8), and breast
cancers (2, 9–11). Functionally, aberrant miRNA expression
can affect cell proliferation (12), apoptosis (4), chemo- and
radiation-sensitivity (13), development of metastases (14),
epithelial–mesenchymal transition (5), and could even potentially define the cancer stem cell phenotype (5).
Breast cancer is unfortunately the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women, and the second leading cause of
cancer deaths in the developed world (15). The majority of

women presenting with lymph node negative (LNN) disease
fare well (16); however, the development of metastatic relapse
is almost always incurable (17). Several studies have described
putative breast cancer-specific miRNA signatures (2, 9, 10, 18);
others have correlated miRNA expression with bio-pathologic
features, including estrogen and progesterone receptor status
(10). None to date, however, has been consistently validated, or
utilized in clinical management.
In an effort to contribute to the understanding of miRNAs
in human breast cancer, we had previously conducted a
global miRNA profiling (11), wherein 4 miRNAs were identified to dichotomize relapse risk; 1 of which was hsa-miR301, associated in particular with nodal and distant relapses.
MicroRNA-301 (miR-301) has been previously noted to be
deregulated in pancreatic (19), hepatocellular (20), and small
cell lung cancers (21). It is located in the intron of SKA2
(spindle and kinetochore associated complex subunit 2), and
was shown to regulate the expression of miR-301 in a lung
cancer cell line (22), but little else is known about miR-301.
In this study, we report that miR-301 promotes breast cancer
proliferation, invasion, and tumor growth, mediated at least
by FoxF2, BBC3, and PTEN. Furthermore, miR-301 likely
cooperates with its host gene SKA2, contributing to the
aggressive breast cancer phenotype with promotion of distant disease.

comparing Tamoxifen versus tamoxifen plus breast radiotherapy for LNN breast cancer (16) served as the cohort for
miRNA profiling evaluation. The current study utilized a case
control design. Case patients (n ¼ 33) were identified as any
individual who experienced local, lymph node, or distant
metastasis within 10 years. Controls (n ¼ 38) were identified
as patients who had never experienced any relapse or death
from cancer with >10 years’ follow-up. The clinical characteristics of these 71 patients are described in Table 1. Five
reduction mammoplasty specimens served as normal comparators. All studies have received Research Ethics Board
approval from the University Health Network.
Cell lines and transfections
Primary human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, MDA-MB231, MDA-MB-468, and T47D were obtained from American
Type Culture Collection (2005–2007), and freshly recovered

www.aacrjournals.org

from liquid nitrogen (<6 months). They were cultured in RPMI
1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. MCF-10A cells were
obtained from Dr. Linda Penn (Ontario Cancer Institute),
and grown in DMEM/HAM F12 supplemented with 5% horse
serum, insulin, hEGF, hydrocortisone (Clonetics), and cholera
toxin (Sigma). All cells have been authenticated using Short
Tandem Repeat analyses, and are regularly examined using
light microscopy. All cells are tested and determined to be free
from Mycoplasma contamination every month.
The cells were transfected using the LipofectAMINE 2000
(Invitrogen) reverse transfection protocol, according to the
manufacturer's instructions. AntagomiR-301, anti-miR negative control 1 (NC; Ambion), siRNA-SKA2, and scrambled
siRNA (siC) were all transfected at a final concentration of
40 nmol/L.
Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of miRNAs and
mRNAs
The expression of hsa-miR-301 was measured using the
standard Taqman MicroRNA Assay (Applied Biosystems) as
previously reported (11). The primers used for mRNA expression are listed in Supplementary Table S1. RNA was isolated
using the Norgen kit (Norgen Biotek Corporation).
Cell proliferation and colony-forming assays
Cytopathic effects of depleting miR-301 were evaluated in
MCF-7 and T47D cells using the MTS assay (Promega), which
is a colorimetric method for determining the viable cells in
proliferation and cytotoxicity. For colony formation assays,
MCF-7 and T47D cells were seeded onto plates 48 hours after
transfection, incubated for 2 weeks, then fixed and stained,
followed by colony counting.
Cell migration and invasion assays
For scratch migration assay, antagomiR-301 or NC-transfected cells were scratched using a standard 200 AL tip. Serial
photographs were obtained at different time point using an
Axiovert 100 M phase contrast microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.).
Invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells was assessed using the Matrigel
Invasion Chamber (BD Biosciences), with conditions detailed
in the Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Target identification by mRNA profiling
MCF-7 and MB-231 cells were transfected with either antagomiR-301 or NC. RNA was isolated 24 and 72 hours later, and
gene expression was analyzed using the Whole Human Genome 444K Array (Agilent). Genes with greater than 2-fold
expression change relative to NC were considered as potential
targets of miR-301, hence selected for further investigation.
Western blotting
MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with either antagomiR301 or NC, then harvested on ice after 72 hours. Proteins were
probed with mouse anti-FoxF2 (Abnova), rabbit anti-PTEN, pAkt (S473), total Akt (Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit antiPUMA BBC3 (Novus Biologicals LLC), or anti-GAPDH
(Abcam). SKA2 protein was detected using a rabbit antiSKA2 antibody (ProSci Inc.).

Luciferase assay
The 30 -UTRs of FoxF2, PTEN, BBC3 and Col2A1 were
amplified by PCR and cloned downstream of the luciferase
gene in a pMIRREPORT luciferase vector (Ambion). A mutant
sequence was also cloned as a validation plasmid. Either pMirluciferase or pMir-luciferasegene specific vectors were
cotransfected with antagomiR-301 or NC in MDA-MB-231
or MCF-7 cell lines. pRL-SV vector (Promega) containing
Renilla luciferase was also transfected with each condition
as a reference control. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities
were measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay
(Promega).
In vivo experiments
Six- to 8-week-old severe combined immunodeficient mice
(SCID) CB.17 female mice were utilized for the xenograft
experiments. MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with antagomiR-301, NC or LipofectAMINE 2000. At 48 hours posttransfection, cells were harvested, 5  105 viable cells were diluted
in 100 mL culture medium, then mixed with 100 mL of Matrigel
(BD Biosciences). Cells were then injected subcutaneously
into the flank of SCID mice. Tumor volume was measured
twice weekly using a caliper, calculated as (tumor length 
width2)/2. MCF-7 xenograft studies were conducted as
described, but with the addition of implanting a 17b-estradiol
pellet subcutaneously 1 day before cell injection.
Detection of miR-301 using in situ hybridization
In situ hybridization (ISH) was performed using a catalyzed
signal amplification method (GenPoint signal amplification
system; DakoCytomation) using the 50 biotin-labeled miR-301
miRCURYTM locked nucleic acid detection probe, or a
scrambled negative control probe (50 nmol/L; Exiqon). Positive hybridization signals were visualized by adding the chromogenic substrate diaminobenzidine.

AntagomiR-301 caused significant reduction in miR301 expression, leading to reduced viability and
decreased clonogenicity
The expression of miR-301 was evaluated in 4 human breast
cancer cell lines: MCF-7, T47D, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB468, compared to that of the normal human mammary
epithelial cell line MCF-10A. As shown in Figure 1B, miR301 was overexpressed in all 4 cell lines, indicating that these
models are reasonable models for the primary human cancer
scenario. To assess the biological role of miR-301, antagomiR301 was utilized in MCF-7 and T47D cells to knockdown its
expression, showing a more than 9-fold reduction as early as
24 hours posttransfection, persisting for 72 hours (Fig. 1C).
This reduction in miR-301 led to a decrease in viability in
both MCF-7 and T47D cells by 40% and 50% respectively at 72
hours posttransfection (Fig. 1D), which in turn translated to
reduced clonogenicity (Fig. 1E), more so in the MCF-7 than the
T47D cells (50% and 80%, respectively), concordant with the
MTS data (Fig. 1D).

Results

Reducing miR-301 expression can increase sensitivity
to tamoxifen
Given that all the participants in this clinical trial were
treated with tamoxifen (16), and the association of miR-301
with breast cancer relapses, this raised the question as to
whether miR-301 could modulate tamoxifen sensitivity. A
dose–response curve was first established, demonstrating that
MCF-7 cells (estrogen-receptor positive) were indeed sensitive
to 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen, with an IC50 of 300 nmol/L at 48
hours (Supplementary Fig. S2A). When MCF-7 cells were
cotreated with antagomiR-301 plus 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen
(300 nmol/L), a time-dependent cytotoxicity was observed,
down to 38% at 48 hours, compared to NC, antagomiR alone,
or NC with tamoxifen (Fig. 1F). However, this observation only
applied at the IC50 dose of 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (300 nmol/L).
A similar result was also observed in the T47D cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B), suggesting that miR-301 depletion could
modulate tamoxifen sensitivity, although this appeared to be
dependent on the dose of tamoxifen.

Immunohistochemistry for SKA2, CD31, and Ki-67
Expression of SKA2, CD31, and Ki-67 were evaluated on
tumor sections using microwave antigen retrieval in combination with the Level-2 Ultra Streptavidin system. Rabbit
polyclonal anti-human SKA2 antibody (1:200 dilution; PorSci
Inc.), rat anti-mouse CD31 antibody (1:50 dilution; BD Pharmingen), and mouse anti-human Ki-67 antigen (1:100 dilution;
DakoCytomation) were utilized.
Statistical analysis
Box plots were utilized to visually explore the relationship
between miR-301 or SKA2 expression using a Mann–Whitney–
Wilcoxon test. All other data were expressed as the mean 
standard error (SE); a value of P <0.05 was considered to be
statistically significant.

Low Density Array (Panel v1.0; Applied Biosystems). In comparison with 5 normal mammary epithelial tissues, 57 miRs
were significantly deregulated with adjusted values of P <0.05,
amongst which 54 were upregulated and 3 were downregulated (data not shown). Amongst the top deregulated miRNAs
was miR-301, which was 6.7-fold upregulated, compared to
normal tissues (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Furthermore,
patients with higher miR-301 expression level experienced a
worse DFS survival compared to those with lower miR-301
expression (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Most interestingly, the
relapses associated with miR-301 expression were nodal or
distant metastases, not local recurrences (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S1C).

Figure 1. miR-301 overexpression in LNN breast cancer was strongly associated with tumor relapse. AntagomiR-301 caused significant reduction in miR-301
expression, leading to reduced viability, decreased clonogenicity, and increased sensitivity to tamoxifen. A, overexpression of miR-301 was strongly
associated with distant/nodal (*, P ¼ 0.03) or multiple (*, P ¼ 0.02) relapses. The Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test was used to explore the relationship between
miR-301 expressions with relapse type. B, miR-301 was overexpressed in all 4 human breast cancer cell lines. C–E, antagomiR-301 significantly reduced cell
viability and decreased clonogenicity in both MCF-7 and T47D cells. F, depleting miR-301 increased tamoxifen sensitivity (300 nmol/L) in MCF-7 cells. Each

knockdown could affect cell migration or invasion. Indeed,
using the scratch assay, antagomiR-301 did reduce migration
for both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 2A). Furthermore,
miR-301 depletion reduced the invasive ability of the aggressive MDA-MB-231 cells to 44% versus 62% for NC cells (P <
0.05; Fig. 2B).
The reduced clonogenicity in vitro translated to the in vivo
model wherein antagomiR-301-treated MDA-MB-231 or
MCF-7 cells showed significantly delayed tumor growth
compared to mice injected with either NC- or Lipofectamine-treated cells (P ¼ 0.04 and P ¼ 0.05, respectively;
Fig. 2C). To acquire further insights into the mediators of
miR-301 suppression leading to reduced tumor growth,
tumors from the NC- and antagomiR-301-treated mice were
collected 45 days after implantation. Figure 2D showed
reduced tumor microvessel density, observed via CD31
immunoexpression in the antagomiR-301-treated MDAMB-231 tumor compared to a control tumor. Ki-67 expression was only slightly reduced (data not shown), indicating
that miR-301 affected tumor angiogenesis.

target of FoxF2 was evaluated post–miR-301 depletion. The
overexpression of Wnt5a has been correlated with increased
cell motility and invasion in melanoma and breast cancer cells
(25). In 3 of 4 tested breast cancer cell lines, the basal
expression of Wnt-5a was slightly increased (Supplementary
Fig. S4B). Depletion of miR-301 in turn reduced Wnt5a expression (Fig. 3D), suggesting that miR-301 could be regulating
Wnt5a via FoxF2, at least in the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
cells.
Given the reduced microvessel density observed in the
MDA-MB-231 tumors when miR-301 was depleted, and VEGF
being a known downstream effecter of PTEN-Akt, we asked
whether VEGF levels would be differentially expressed in our
primary human breast cancer samples. Indeed, the median
VEGF transcript expression level analyzed in the remaining
samples with sufficient RNA was 7.7-fold higher than normal
tissues, compared to 15.4-fold between the nonrelapsed versus
relapsed breast cancer patient samples (Fig. 3E), suggesting
that VEGF could indeed be a downstream effecter of breast
cancer relapse.

miR-301 directly targets FoxF2, PTEN, BBC3iso-2, and
Col2A1 in breast cancer cells
These phenotypic data thus far indicate that miR-301
overexpression causes a myriad of effects including breast
cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, along with
tumor growth and angiogenesis. To identify its potential
mRNA targets which could mediate these changes, a tripronged approach was undertaken (23, 24); details provided
in Supplementary Figure S2C. Fourteen overlapped candidate targets were thus identified (FoxF2, BBC3, PTEN,
CoL2A1, ITGB8, IL18, MMP13, Bcl2L14, ARRP1, E2F2,
RAG1, IGFBP2, IGFBP5, and SMOC2). Individual quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays showed that the basal
expression of 7 of these candidate transcripts were underexpressed in the majority of the 4 human breast cancer cell
lines (FoxF2, PTEN, BBC3, Col2A1, Il18, ITGB8, and MMP13),
which were thus selected for further evaluation (Supplementary Fig. S3). Knocking down miR-301 induced the
expression modestly in 5 of 7 mRNA transcript levels for
both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, by only 1.1 to 2-fold, at
either 48 or 72 hours posttransfection (Fig. 3A). Western
blotting confirmed increased protein expression for FoxF2,
PTEN, BBC3 with reduced expression of p-Akt, compared to
NC (Fig. 3B).
The direct interaction of miR-301 with the top 4 candidate
mRNA transcripts: FoxF2, PTEN, BBC3, Col2A1 was clearly
shown by the induction of their respective luciferase expression by 1.2 to 2-fold when MDA-MB-231 cells were cotransfected with antagomiR-301 and the luciferase reporter
plasmid carrying the relevant wild-type 30 -UTR sequences,
which was completely abrogated by the mutant 30 -UTR
sequences (Fig. 3C). Almost identical data were observed
for the MCF-7 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4A), thereby corroborating that these 4 mRNA transcripts were indeed bona fide
targets for miR-301.
In order to identify some of the further downstream effectors of the observed cellular phenotypic changes, Wnt5a, a

SKA2 is the host gene of miR-301
It is well known that more than 50% of mammalian miRNA
genes are located within introns of protein-coding or noncoding units (26), wherein miRNAs could be transcribed in
parallel with their host genes. Interrogation of the Sanger
miRNA database revealed that miR-301 overlaps with the first
intron of the SKA2 gene, located on 17q22 (Fig. 4A). SKA2 is a
recently described member of the SKA complex, which is
essential for proper chromosomal segregation (27). SKA2 has
been shown to be overexpressed in human lung and breast
cancer tissues, perhaps mediating cancer cell proliferation
(28). Hence, the expression of SKA2 was investigated in the
same LNN breast cancer specimens using qRT-PCR. Amongst
the 64 tumors examined (with sufficient remaining RNA), 44
showed upregulation of SKA2, with 37 (84%) exhibiting overexpression of both SKA2 and miR-301 (Supplementary
Fig. S5A). Interestingly, SKA2 overexpression was also significantly associated with only a higher risk of nodal or distant
relapse (P ¼ 0.03; Fig. 4B). Similarly, SKA2 overexpression was
also observed in all 4 human breast cancer cell lines (Fig. 4C),
which when knocked down using siRNA, led to a significant
reduction in cell viability down to 50% in the MCF-7, or 70% in
the MDA-MB-231 cells, in a time-dependent manner up to 72
hours posttransfection (Fig. 4E). Reduced mRNA and protein
levels of SKA2 after siSKA2 were corroborated using qRT-PCR
and Western blotting, respectively (Fig. 4D). These data indicated that SKA2 could also independently influence tumor cell
proliferation in vitro.

Colocalization of miR-301 and SKA2 in tumor cells
Finally, to further ascertain that miR-301 and SKA2 were
indeed coexpressed in primary human breast cancer, miR301 was visualized using in situ hybridization, and SKA2 via
immunohistochemistry. As shown in Figure 5A and B,
intense miR-301 signals were observed in the cytoplasm
of tumor cells, not observed with a scrambled control
probe (Supplementary Fig. S5B). In a serial section of the

downregulation will lead to Akt
activation, which can promote

tumor angiogenesis.
Downregulation of FoxF2 can
increase expression of Wnt5a,
which can promote cell

which can also potentially
increase proliferation.

Discussion
Current clinical decisions on breast cancer management for
LNN patients are based on parameters such as age, menopausal status, tumor size, and histology, which are suboptimal,
and likely result in the overtreatment of many of our patients
(29). Several molecular prognostic markers have been proposed (30); the most frequently utilized set in North America is
Oncotype DX, a 21-gene assay applicable to LNN estrogen

receptor–positive cancers (31). The true utility of these predictive signatures, however, are still under evaluation, underscoring the biological complexities of LNN disease; hence the
importance of determining whether novel insights could be
acquired through the lens of miRNAs.
The current study reported miR-301 as a novel oncogene in
LNN breast cancer. miR-301 overexpression was associated with
an increased risk of nodal or distant relapse, and mediated
proliferation, migration, invasion, resistance to tamoxifen, and
tumor formation with increased angiogenesis. These pleiotropic
effects of miR-301 were directly mediated by several well-known
oncogenic targets and pathways, including PTEN, FoxF2, BBC3,
and Col2a1. Furthermore, its coexpression with SKA2 likely
cooperatively promotes breast cancer progression (Fig. 5E).
Dysregulation of the PTEN-PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is
well characterized in its myriad of roles in causing proliferation,
increasing angiogenesis, migration, and invasion, leading to
metastases (32). In fact, we had previously reported dysregulation of the PTEN-PKB axis in primary human breast cancer
samples (33). Although the mechanism of dysregulation was
unclear, further examination of the 29 overlapping samples
(from the previous and the current cohorts), showed that 14
samples overexpressed both miR-301 and PTEN; 5 overexpressed miR-301 with concomitantly low PTEN; and 10 were
reversed with low miR-301 and high PTEN expression (P ¼
0.07), suggesting that in this small cohort, there might indeed
be a trend of a reciprocal relationship between miR-301 with
PTEN. In the current study, PTEN appears to be a central target
of miR-301 in mediating many of the observed phenotypic
changes in the breast cancer cells consequent to its knock
down. We observed increased proliferation, migration, and
invasion in vitro (Figs. 1D and E and 2A and B), which can
certainly all be attributed by the mitogenic signals of a downregulated PTEN cascade, leading to activated PI (3) K-Akt, with
multiple further downstream signals involving matrix metalloproteinases, and integrins (34). Furthermore, we observed
enhanced tumor formation, associated with increased microvessel density in vivo, corroborated by increased VEGF mRNA
expression in the same primary breast cancer tissues, which in
turn was associated with relapse (Fig. 3E); again, these phenotypes would be consistent with an activated Akt cascade (34).
FoxF2 is a member of the forkhead family of transcription
factors (35), which regulate diverse cellular processes (36).
FoxF2 has been recently described to be underexpressed in
prostate cancer (37), and can downregulate Wnt5a (38). Our
data show that FoxF2 is directly targeted by miR-301, and miR301 depletion reduced Wnt5a expression (Fig. 3). Wnt5a activates the noncanonical Wnt pathways, with distinct signaling
and biological phenotypes depending on context, and availability of partner receptors (39). There is controversy regarding
the role of Wnt5a in human malignancies, with reports of both
tumor suppressive (40), and oncogenic effects (41). Certainly
Wnt5a can mediate cell polarity, migration, and invasion
through its interactions with the Frizzled receptors (39), which
would be concordant with our observations via the miR-301/
FoxF2/Wnt5a axis (Fig. 5E), although clearly, the roles of FoxF2
and Wnt5a in human malignancies are just beginning to be
understood, definitely warranting further examination.

In addition to elucidating the cancer relevant pathways
downstream of miR-301 such as the aforementioned PTEN
and FoxF2, we also noted that miR-301 was located within the
first intron of SKA2 (42). Not only were both miR-301 and SKA2
co-overexpressed in our breast cancer samples (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. S5A), but SKA2 with miR-301 also associated
with clinical outcome in that the worst disease-free survival
was observed for the tumors which overexpressed both genes
versus the best outcome when neither was overexpressed
(Supplementary Fig. S6A). SKA2 forms at the kinetochore–
microtubule interface during mitosis (27, 43). Transient
depletion of the SKA complex destabilizes the microtubule–
kinetochore attachment, resulting in metaphase arrest, while
more stringent and prolonged SKA depletion causes chromosome congression defects with subsequent cell death (27).
Very little is known about SKA2 in human cancers, but a
recent study with the A549 cancer cell line described miR-301
to be indirectly upregulating SKA2, and its depletion reduced
colony formation in agar (22). Their observations would be
consistent with our observed phenotype wherein overexpression of SKA2 (with miR-301) appears to promote proliferation
and tumor progression, although the precise mechanisms and
pathways remain to be elucidated.
The 2 other direct targets of miR-301, BBC3, and Col2A1
were shown at the transcript and protein levels along with
luciferase reporter data (Fig. 3A–C, Supplementary Figs. S3
and S4). We were unable to show a significant antiapoptotic
process after increasing BBC3 levels in any of our tested breast
cancer cells. Col2A1 encodes the a chain of type II collagen
(44), which is an important component of the extracellular
matrix (45). It is certainly conceivable that the migration and
invasion observed after miR-301 depletion (Fig. 2A and B)
could be mediated through the downregulation of Col2A1.
Finally, given that all the participants in this randomized
clinical trial received tamoxifen, and miR-301 overexpression
was associated with relapse, we asked whether miR-301 depletion could affect tamoxifen sensitivity, and indeed showed a
modest effect in both MCF-7 and T47D cells (Fig. 1F, Supplementary Fig. S2B). Despite decades of clinical experience with
tamoxifen, the precise mechanisms of tamoxifen resistance
remain largely unknown. Our data do not clearly show the
pathways of resistance, but activation of Akt has certainly been
implicated (46); hence it is plausible that the miR-301/PTEN/
Akt pathway could be influencing tamoxifen sensitivity, based
on our cell line and clinical observations.
In conclusion, our experiments have shown a novel pleiotropic oncogenic role for miR-301 through regulation of key
signaling pathways involving at least PTEN, FOXF2, and
Col2A1, and working in cooperation with SKA2. The resulting
phenotype of an upregulated miR-301 includes increased
proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumor formation.
Furthermore, miR-301 overexpression is a candidate prognostic marker for metastases in patients with LNN breast cancer,
which should be validated in a larger patient cohort.
