ABSTRACT
NANOG expression in prostate cancer is highly correlated with cancer stem
cell characteristics and resistance to androgen deprivation. However, it is not clear
whether NANOG or its pseudogenes contribute to the malignant potential of cancer.
We established NANOG- and NANOGP8-knockout DU145 prostate cancer cell lines
using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Knockouts of NANOG and NANOGP8 significantly
attenuated malignant potential, including sphere formation, anchorage-independent
growth, migration capability, and drug resistance, compared to parental DU145 cells.
NANOG and NANOGP8 knockout did not inhibit in vitro cell proliferation, but in vivo
tumorigenic potential decreased significantly. These phenotypes were recovered in
NANOG- and NANOGP8-rescued cell lines. These results indicate that NANOG and
NANOGP8 proteins are expressed in prostate cancer cell lines, and NANOG and
NANOGP8 equally contribute to the high malignant potential of prostate cancer.

correlated with postoperative survival in patients with
lung and ovarian cancer [19, 24], and increased NANOG
expression in human prostate cancer tissues is correlated
with an increased Gleason score, which is an indicator of
poor prognosis [22, 28].
NANOG (hereinafter NANOG1 to avoid confusion)
is particularly interesting because this gene has at least
10 pseudogenes, but the sequence similarities among
these genes confounds analyses of NANOG expression
[29]. The NANOGP8 pseudogene has attracted attention
because only NANOGP8 encodes the full-length
NANOG1 protein with a 2-amino acid substitution, and
NANOGP8 is expressed in cancer cells and increases
the clonogenicity and tumorigenicity [18, 21, 22, 30]
[31–34]. NANOGP8 overexpression in vitro promotes
sphere formation and migration in a prostate cancer
cell line and drug resistance in a breast cancer cell line
[30]. In addition, NANOGP8-overexpressing cells form
larger tumors in vivo in immunodeficient mice [30, 33].
However, no antibodies can distinguish NANOG1 and
NANOGP8 proteins because of the high similarity
between these two proteins. Therefore, the expression of

INTRODUCTION
Tumors include a small population of cells with stem
cell-like properties, including self-renewal and tumorinitiation capacities [1–5]. These cells are often termed
cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) and express pluripotencyrelated genes [6–9], such as NANOG, OCT3/4, and SOX2,
which are essential transcription factors in embryonic
stem cells (ESCs) [10, 11]. These transcription factors
are involved in various somatic cancers and drive tumor
development [12–18]. NANOG is expressed in various
cancers, such as ovarian cancer [19], breast cancer [20],
colorectal cancer [21], and prostate cancer [22], and it is
enriched in CSCs [16]. CD44+CD133+ and CD133+ cells
are markers of prostate CSCs in human prostate cancer
tissues [23], and these immune cells express higher
NANOG mRNA levels compared to their corresponding
negative cells. Increased NANOG expression is associated
with poor prognosis in various cancers, such as lung
cancer [24], oral cancer [25], brain cancer [26], ovarian
cancer [19], breast cancer [27], and prostate cancer
[22]. Additionally, NANOG expression is negatively

the targeted NANOG1 genomic region, and amplicon
sequence analyses demonstrated that NANOG1-/- #1
and NANOG1-/- #2 harbored 26 bp and 8 bp deletions,
respectively, in exon 2 of the NANOG1 gene (Figure 1B).
All 16 analyzed sequences from NANOG1-/- #1 and all
8 analyzed sequences from NANOG1-/- #2 exhibited
the same deletions. The amplified genomic region in
DU145 cells includes a restriction enzyme cleavage site
for BfmI, and this cleavage site is lost in NANOG1-/- #1.
We performed restriction enzyme analysis of the PCR
amplicon to confirm the deletion in NANOG1-/- #1 cells
(Figure 1C). BfmI completely digested the amplicon from
DU145 cells, but the amplicon from NANOG1-/- #1 cells
was not digested. Therefore, we confirmed the deletion
of the NANOG1 gene on both alleles in NANOG1-/#1 cells. This method to confirm the deletion was not
available in NANOG1-/- #2 cells because the deleted
site did not contain a restriction enzyme site. Therefore,
we confirmed the deletion of the NANOG1 gene on both
alleles in NANOG1-/- #2 cells using sequencing analysis.
The deletions in NANOG1-/- #1 and #2 cells induce
frame shifts, which result in premature stop codons. We
examined the off-target effects of the gRNAs on NANOG
pseudogenes because the gRNA expression constructs that
targeted exon 2 of NANOG1 exhibit a high similarity to
NANOG pseudogenes. In conclusion, NANOG1-/- #1 cells
have a 19 bp and a 5 bp deletion in NANOGP7 and a 124
bp insertion in NANOGP9. However, NANOG1-/- #2 cells
harbor no indels in NANOG pseudogenes. NANOG1-/cell lines exhibited no off-target effects in NANOGP8,
which is the only NANOG pseudogene with the ability to
produce intact full-length NANOG protein.
To delete the NANOGP8 gene, we designed two
gRNAs outside of NANOGP8 (Figure 1D). Because
most NANOG pseudogenes, including NANOGP8, are
intronless genes with highly conserved sequences, it is
difficult to specifically amplify the exon of NANOGP8.
It is also challenging to quickly examine the genotypes
of NANOGP8-targeted clones using the single-gRNA
approach employed for NANOG1 (Figure 1A and 1D).
We designed three primer sets to screen for NANOGP8
gene deletion. Primer set F1 + R1 amplified a 2851-bp
region of the NANOGP8 gene in DU145 cells, and the
amplicon was apparently shorter in the NANOGP8 gene
knockout cell line (Figure 1E). Primer sets F1 + R2 and
F2 + R1 could not amplify the NANOGP8 genomic region
in the NANOGP8 gene knockout cell line (Figure 1E).
These primers identified two NANOGP8-/- cell lines.
Sequence analysis of the PCR products revealed that
NANOGP8-/- #1 had a 1838-bp and a 1978-bp deletion,
and NANOGP8-/- #2 had a 1825-bp and a 925-bp
deletion (Figure 1F), which indicated that we generated
two independent NANOGP8-knockout DU145 cell lines.
Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in our attempt to
establish NANOG1- and NANOGP8-double knockout cell
lines (Supplementary Figure 1).

NANOG1 and its pseudogenes has only been analyzed
using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) and cDNA sequencing analysis [35]. Most somatic
cancer cell lines predominantly express protein-coding
NANOGP8 and non-coding NANOGP5 with markedly
less NANOG1 expression. In contrast, human ESCs and
the NTERA2 cell line, which is derived from a human
teratocarcinoma, express large amounts of NANOG1 [35].
Therefore, NANOGP8 is likely a primary contributor of
NANOG protein expression in various somatic cancers
[35], including prostate cancer. However, the proportion of
NANOG protein expression that comes from NANOG1 and
NANOG8 in cancer cells is not known. The overexpression
of NANOGP8 in prostate cancer cell lines has been shown
to increase migration and tumorigenic potential [30],
and the overexpression of NANOG1 has been shown to
increase migration in an ovarian cancer cell line [19]
and increase migration, metastasis, and tumorigenic
potential in a breast cancer cell line [27]. However, these
previous gain-of-function studies did not include loss-offunction analyses of NANOG1 and NANOGP8 because
the sequence similarity makes individual gene knockout
without off-target effects difficult. Therefore, a causal role
of NANOG1 and NANOGP8 in cancer cells is not clear.
This study established NANOG1- and NANOGP8knockout, DU145 prostate cancer cell lines using CRISPR/
Cas9 system-mediated genetic engineering [36, 37]. In
the DU145 prostate cancer cell line with endogenous
NANOG1 and NANOGP8 proteins, both NANOG1
and NANOGP8 contributed equally to many properties
associated with malignant potential in prostate cancer,
including sphere formation, migration, drug resistance,
and tumorigenic potential. Our findings suggest that the
malignant potential of cancer cells is increased by NANOG
protein expression from both NANOGP8 and NANOG1.

RESULTS
Establishment of NANOG1- and NANOGP8knockout DU145 cell lines and rescue cell lines
Human NANOG1 has at least 10 pseudogenes.
NANOG1 and the pseudogene NANOGP8 code for intact
NANOG protein. We first generated each gene knockout
in DU145 cells (human prostate cancer cell line) using the
CRISPR/Cas9 system to evaluate the functions of these
two genes [36, 37]. We designed two gRNAs against
exon 2 of NANOG1, which codes for the homeodomain,
to avoid non-specific effects of the CRISPR/Cas9 system
(Figure 1A). Genomic DNA PCR products from each
cell were cloned into a plasmid to analyze the targeted
NANOG1 genomic region in each transfected cell line.
The NANOG1 PCR primers only amplify the NANOG1
genomic region because the forward primer recognizes
intron 1 of NANOG1, which is unique among NANOG1
and its pseudogenes (Figure 1A). This primer amplified

We analyzed NANOG protein expression in each
cell line using Western blot to examine whether NANOG1
and NANOGP8 contribute to the production of NANOG
protein in DU145 cells. NANOG protein expression
decreased significantly in the NANOG1- and NANOGP8knockout cell lines (Figure 1G). NANOG1 is the primary
contributor of NANOG expression in ESCs, but NANOG
protein is primarily derived from NANOGP8 in DU145
cells, as shown by PCR-based analyses [35]. Therefore,
we designed three “multi-NANOG” primer sets with high
similarity to NANOG pseudogenes, with the exception
of NANOGP3 and NANOGP6, which are too different
from the other NANOG pseudogenes to be amplified
by a common primer set (Figure 2A and 2B). Sequence
analyses indicated that primer 1 predominantly amplified
NANOGP8, primer 2 amplified NANOGP8, NANOGP1
and NANOG1, and primer 3 mainly amplified NANOGP4
and NANOGP5. The upper amplicon of primer 2 was
derived from NANOGP1 and NANOG1 cDNA, which
are derived from each pre-mRNA that included intron
3 (Figure 2A). Therefore, we conclude that each primer
exhibited a PCR bias (Figure 2A and 2B), and RTPCR and sequence analyses of cloned cDNA are not
appropriate for examining the proportion of NANOG
expression from each gene. DU145 cells actually express
all 7 NANOG genes, including NANOG1 and NANOGP8.
We established a NANOG1-rescued cell line and a
NANOGP8-rescued cell line from NANOG1-/- #1 cells
and NANOGP8-/- #1 cells, respectively, to avoid nonspecific effects of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. NANOG
protein expression was recovered in each rescued cell
line, which suggests that exogenous NANOG1 protein
promotes NANOGP8 expression, and vice versa (Figure
1H). Taken together, our results indicate that DU145 cells
express both NANOGP8 and NANOG1.

the number of spheres that formed after 2 weeks. Five
independent experiments demonstrated that the sphereforming capacity of NANOG1-/- and NANOGP8-/- cells
decreased to approximately 50% compared to DU145
cells (Figure 3C). We also evaluated the sphere-forming
capacity of NANOG1- and NANOGP8-rescued cell lines
and demonstrated that the number of formed spheres in
NANOG1- and NANOGP8-rescued cell lines increased
significantly compared to the non-rescued cell lines
(Figure 3D). The size of the formed spheres in NANOG1-/and NANOGP8-/- cell lines was generally smaller than
the parental DU145 cells, and this phenotype was also
recovered in NANOG1- and NANOGP8-rescued cell lines
(Figure 3E). We also utilized the soft agar colony formation
assay to examine clonogenic potential under anchorageindependent conditions. The clonogenic potential under
anchorage-independent conditions was lower in the
NANOG1-/- and NANOGP8-/- cell lines compared to
DU145 cells. This phenotype was also recovered in
NANOG1- and NANOGP8-rescued cell lines (Figure 3F).
Therefore, we concluded that NANOG1 and NANOGP8
increase the clonogenic potential of DU145 cells.

NANOG1 and NANOGP8 knockout decreases
DU145 cell migration capability
NANOG controls cell migration in cancer [19]
[38]. Therefore, wound-healing assays were performed
to examine the effect of NANOG1 and NANOGP8 on
prostate cancer cell migration. Migration was decreased
in NANOG1-/- and NANOGP8-/- cells by 40–60%, and
this phenotype was recovered in the NANOG1- and
NANOGP8-rescued cell lines. The rescued cell lines
exhibited similar migration to parental DU145 cells in this
study (Figure 4A–4C). Decreased E-cadherin expression
in cancer cells leads to epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) [39]. The transcription factor Snail represses
E-cadherin expression [40] and accelerated EMT promotes
cell migration. SNAIL, which encodes SNAIL, is recently
reported to be a transcriptional target of NANOG in
reprograming cells [41]. We also found that NANOG1-/and NANOP8-/- DU145 cells exhibited increased
E-cadherin expression and decreased Snail expression
and that the increased E-cadherin and decreased Snail
expression were abolished in NANOG1- and NANOGP8rescued cells (Figure 4D). These results indicate that
NANOG1 and NANOGP8 are involved in the promotion
of migration capacity in DU145 cells.

NANOG1 and NANOGP8 knockout decreases the
clonogenic potential of DU145 cells
Malignant tumor cells exhibit well-known aggressive
and anchorage-independent cell growth, and a high
clonogenic potential. We first examined NANOG1-/- and
NANOGP8-/- cell proliferation in a monolayer to examine
whether NANOG1 and NANOGP8 were involved in
these well-known tumor cell properties. However, each
knockout cell line exhibited a similar growth rate as
DU145 cells (Figure 3A). NANOGP8-expressing prostate
cancer cells exhibit greater clonogenic potential [30]. We
utilized a colony formation assay to examine the role of
NANOG1 and NANOGP8 in self-renewal. The colonyforming capacity of NANOG1-/- and NANOGP8-/- cells
was decreased compared to parental DU145 cells (Figure
3B). The sphere-forming capacity of prostate cancer cells
is highly associated with tumorigenic potential [34].
Therefore, we examined the sphere-forming capacity
of NANOG1-/- and NANOGP8-/- cells and evaluated

NANOGP8-knockout cells exhibited significantly
decreased tumorigenic potential compared to parental
cells (Figure 6A and 6B). We next examined whether
this phenotype was recovered by exogenous NANOG1
and NANOGP8 expression. NANOG1- and NANOGP8rescued cells showed increased tumorigenic potential
compared to NANOG1-/-+GFP and NANOGP8-/-+GFP
cells, respectively (Figure 6A and 6B). These results
demonstrated that NANOGP8 and NANOG1 increase the
tumorigenic potential of DU145 cells in vivo.

cells led to the same length deletion in both alleles in the
establishment of knockout cell lines using the CRISPR/
Cas9 system, and two DSBs caused by two gRNAs in
NANOGP8-knockout cells led to different length deletions
on each allele. In general, a DSB in mammalian cells
can be repaired by one of two general repair pathways,
non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous
recombination (HR) [45], and a DSB at a target locus
induced by CRISPR/Cas9 can be repaired through either
NHEJ or homology-directed repair (HDR) [46]. DSBs
caused by CRISPR/Cas9 are repaired through NHEJ
in the absence of a homologous repair donor, which
results in indels [46]. Both alleles should have different
indels because NHEJ of the DSBs in both alleles are
independently repaired. Therefore, we speculate that
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated DSBs at the same sites in both
alleles may be repaired by HR after the repair of one
allele by the NHEJ pathway, which results in NANOG1knockout cells with the same deletions on both alleles.
The DNA deletion resulting from the two CRISPR/Cas9mediated DSBs at separate target sites in NANOGP8knockout cells was longer. Therefore, it may be more
difficult to repair these DSBs through the HR pathway,
which results in different deletions on each allele.
NANOG1- and NANOGP8-rescued cell lines
exhibited increased endogenous NANOG protein
expression compared to the parental knockout cell lines
(Figure 1H). The increased endogenous NANOG protein
in the NANOG1-rescued, NANOG1-knockout cell line was
likely derived from NANOGP8, and vice versa, because
only NANOG1 and the NANOG pseudogene NANOGP8
encode full-length NANOG protein. The NANOG1
protein binds to its own gene promoter and promotes its
own expression in ESCs [44]. Therefore, we hypothesize
that NANOG1 and NANOGP8 reciprocally promote each
other’s expression in prostate cancer cells. The reciprocal
promotion between NANOG1 and NANOGP8 may be
important for the maintenance of malignant potential.
Notably, we could not detect substantial NANOG-GFP
expression in either NANOG1- or NANOGP8-rescued cell
lines using fluorescence microscopy, which suggests that
excessive NANOG protein expression is lethal to somatic
cancer cells, as speculated previously [30].
In our study, knockout of NANOG1 and NANOGP8
did not alter cell growth, but knockout of each gene
significantly decreased malignant potential, including
colony formation (Figure 3B, 3C, and 3F), migration (Figure
4A), drug resistance (Figure 5A), and tumorigenicity
(Figure 6A). These results suggest that NANOG activates
cancer cell properties but not cell growth. These data
are consistent with the function of NANOG1 in ESCs, in
which NANOG1 forms a core module that regulates genes
related to cell properties, and cell growth-related genes are
regulated by a MYC module [47].
Our results demonstrated that NANOG1 and
NANOGP8 activate migration capacity via E-cadherin

DISCUSSION
Elucidating the link between transcription factors
and cancer properties is of interest because improves our
understanding of how cancer cells promote malignancy
through the regulation of gene expression pattern. NANOG1
is a critical transcription factor that enables the pluripotent
properties of ESCs [43] [44]. Recent studies suggested a
role for NANOG1 in the progression of malignancy using
knockdown systems [16] [19] [42]. NANOG1 knockdown
using RNAi likely exerts an off-target effect on NANOGP8
mRNA, and vice versa, because of the high similarity
between NANOG1 and NANOGP8 mRNA. Moreover,
knockdown using RNAi cannot completely turn off
target genes, and the possibility that cells with residual
gene function influence other cells cannot be excluded,
especially in tumor development. Therefore, knockdown
experiments are not suitable for functional analyses of
NANOG1 and NANOGP8 genes. Jeter et al. reported that
the overexpression of NANOGP8, but not NANOG1, in
prostate cancer cell lines increases migration capacity and
tumorigenic potential [30]. However, Lu et al. reported that
NANOG1 overexpression in breast cancer cells increases
migration capacity, metastasis, and tumorigenic potential
[27], and Siu et al. reported that NANOG1 overexpression
increased the migration capacity of an ovarian cancer cell
line [19]. Therefore, the effects of NANOG1 and NANOGP8
on malignant potential remain controversial. This study
used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to establish NANOG1- and
NANOGP8-knockout prostate cancer cell lines and examine
the function of NANOG1 and NANOGP8 genes in prostate
cancer cells. We found that DU145 cells express NANOGP8
and NANOG1, in contrast to an earlier report [35]. As
mentioned above (Figure 2), we demonstrated that RT-PCR
and cloning analyses are not suitable for the quantification
of the expression of genes with many pseudogenes with
highly similar mRNA sequences, such as NANOG1, because
primers do not evenly amplify each cDNA despite perfectly
matched primer-target sequences. Our results revealed
an equivalent proportion of NANOG1 and NANOGP8
protein expression and an equivalent function of NANOG1
and NANOGP8 genes in the regulation of the malignant
potential of DU145 prostate cancer cells.

Our data indicate that NANOG1 and NANOGP8 are
relevant to drug resistance. Previous studies demonstrated
22370

Oncotarget

that NANOG1 and NANOGP8 overexpression in MCF7
cells upregulates several detoxification genes, including
ABCG2, Bcl-2, ALDH1A1, and CD133 [30], and
disruption of NANOG1 decreases the expression of MDR1
[48]. MDR1 encodes a P-glycoprotein that pumps various
foreign substances out of cells. Various studies showed that
NANOG1 depletion decreases tumorigenicity [16, 48], and
NANOG1 overexpression increases tumorigenicity [27].
Lu et al. used an inducible NANOG1 transgenic mouse
model and reported that ectopic NANOG1 expression
upregulates the PDGFRa gene [27], which encodes an
alpha-type platelet-derived growth factor receptor that
drives tumorigenesis and metastasis in various cancers
[49]. Emerging evidence also suggests that NANOGP8
overexpression increases tumorigenicity [30, 33]. Our
results indicate that NANOG1 and NANOGP8 are involved
in the tumorigenic potential of prostate cancer cells, which
is consistent with these previous studies.
In our study, the phenotypes (e.g., sphere formation
capacity, migration capability, drug resistance, and
tumorigenic potential) of NANOG1- and NANOGP8rescued cell lines only recovered to the levels of the
parental DU145 cell line despite an excess expression of
NANOG protein in the rescued cell lines. We hypothesize
that this effect resulted from a loss of the reciprocal
promotion between NANOG1 and NANOGP8 in the
NANOG1- and NANOGP8-rescued cell lines.
We attempted to establish a NANOG1- and
NANOGP8-double knockout cell line to examine whether
an NANOG1 and NANOGP8 double knockout exerted a
positive effect on the loss of malignant potential. However,
we were unsuccessful in our attempt. We isolated more than
300 colonies that were candidates for the double knockout,
but we did not find cells with deletions of both NANOG1
and NANOGP8 on both alleles. We identified 2 NANOG1knockout cells out of 46 candidate colonies and 2 NANOGP8knockout cells out of 24 candidate colonies, which suggests
that the knockout of both NANOG1 and NANOGP8 genes in
DU145 cells is lethal (Supplementary Figure 1).
In summary, we established NANOG1- and
NANOGP8-knockout prostate cancer cell lines using the
CRISPR/Cas9 system. Our results indicate that NANOG1
and NANOGP8 are expressed equally and that both genes
activate many properties that are associated with the
malignant potential in prostate cancer cells, including
sphere formation capacity, migration capability, drug
resistance, and tumorigenic potential.

Tesque) supplemented with 10% FBS (Biowest), 100 U/
ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Penicillinstreptomycin mixed solution; Nacalai Tesque). These cells
were incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 95%
air and 5% CO2. Growth curves were generated for each
cell line as follows. Each cell line was seeded in a 6-well
plate at 1 × 105 cells/well and incubated for up to 6 days.
Cell growth was assessed by cell counting every other day.
Cells were trypsinized before reaching 70% confluency
and transferred to 10-cm dishes. All experiments were
conducted using passage-matched parental cells.

Establishment of DU145NANOG1-/-, DU145NANOGP8-/-,
and NANOG-rescue cell lines
The targeted gRNA expression oligos were introduced
into the pX330 vector [46] (Addgene). The sequences
of these oligos are shown in Supplementary Table 1.
A mixture of 1 μg of pX330 plasmid DNA containing each
target gRNA sequence and 0.5 μg of pPGKpuro (Addgene)
was transfected into suspended DU145 (1 × 105 cells) [36].
NEON (Invitrogen) electroporation was used to transfect
the plasmids, and transfected cells were cultured in medium
containing 1.0 μg/ml puromycin for 2 days for selection.
Surviving cells were trypsinized and diluted in medium for
colony formation. Single colonies were selected, and each
colony was passaged and genotyped. DNA was isolated
using a DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen). The genomic
region surrounding the CRISPR/Cas9 target site for each
gene was PCR amplified, and PCR products were purified
using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. The amplicons were
cloned into the pCR-BluntII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen).
Each colony was selected, and the amplicon sequences
were analyzed using a 3100 Genetic Analyzer (ABI).
Supplementary Table 1 shows the primer sequences.
NANOG-rescued DU145 cell lines and control cell
lines were generated by transducing 30 μg of plasmid
(CAG-GFP-NANOG1-IRES-Puro, CAG-GFP-NANOGP8IRES-Puro, and -GFP-IRES-Puro) into suspended
NANOG1-/- cells and NANOGP8-/- cells (2 × 107 cells).
Single colonies were selected after a 0.5-μg/ml puromycin
selection. NANOG protein expression levels in each cell
line were examined using Western blotting.

In vivo tumorigenicity experiments
DU145 and its derivatives (2 × 106 cells) were
implanted subcutaneously in NOD-SCID mice. These NODSCID mice, aged 5 weeks, were purchased from CLEA
Japan and maintained in a temperature-controlled, pathogenfree room. All animals were handled according to approved
protocols and the guidelines of the Animal Committee of
Osaka University (Osaka, Japan). Mouse appearance and
tumor development were observed for 7 weeks. Tumor
volume was calculated according to the following formula:
tumor volume (mm3) = length × (width)2/2 [50].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
The androgen-independent human prostate cell
line DU145 was purchased from the American Type
Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). DU145 and its
derivatives were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Nacalai

were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)
membranes. The membranes were blocked with 3% skim
milk and incubated overnight at 4°C with the primary
antibodies. Signals were detected using Chemi-Lumi
One or Chemi-Lumi One Super (Nacalai Tesque) and an
ImageQuant LAS 4000 mini system (GE Healthcare).

A CytoSelect 96-well Cell Transformation Assay
(Soft Agar Colony Formation) Kit (Cell Biolabs) was
used to evaluate anchorage-independent growth according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, DU145 and
its derivatives (1.5 × 103 cells) were mixed with an agar
solution, seeded into wells, and culture medium was added
to each well. Cells were incubated at 37°C in a humidified
atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 for 8 days. The
colonies were lysed after agar solubilization, and CyQuant
GR Dye was used to quantify anchorage-independent
growth using a 485/520 nm filter set.

Statistical analysis
The results are reported as the mean ± SD. A twotailed unpaired Student’s t-test was used to determine the
statistical significance of differences between two groups,
and Tukey’s test was used to determine the statistical
significance of differences between more than three
groups. Probability values of p < 0.05 were considered
statistically significant. Statistical analyses were conducted
using JMP9 (SAS Institute).

Sphere culture
Spheres of DU145 and its derivatives formed as
previously described [51]. Briefly, each cell line (2 ×
103 cells) was plated on low-attachment 6-well dishes
(Corning). Cells were cultured in a serum-free epithelial
basal medium (Cambrex) supplemented with B27, 4 μg/ml
insulin (Sigma-Aldrich), 20 ng/ml EGF, and 20 ng/ml
basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; Invitrogen) for
2 weeks. Sphere forming capacity was assessed based on
the number of colonies.
