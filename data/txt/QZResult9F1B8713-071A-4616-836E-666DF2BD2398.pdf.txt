Abstract
V-domain Ig suppressor of T-cell activation (VISTA) is a novel negative checkpoint ligand that is homologous
to PD-L1 and suppresses T-cell activation. This study demonstrates the multiple mechanisms whereby VISTA
relieves negative regulation by hematopoietic cells and enhances protective antitumor immunity. VISTA is highly
expressed on myeloid cells and Foxp3þCD4þ regulatory cells, but not on tumor cells within the tumor
microenvironment (TME). VISTA monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment increased the number of tumorspeciﬁc T cells in the periphery and enhanced the inﬁltration, proliferation, and effector function of tumorreactive T cells within the TME. VISTA blockade altered the suppressive feature of the TME by decreasing the
presence of monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells and increasing the presence of activated dendritic cells
within the tumor microenvironment. In addition, VISTA blockade impaired the suppressive function and reduced
the emergence of tumor-speciﬁc Foxp3þCD4þ regulatory T cells. Consequently, VISTA mAb administration as a
monotherapy signiﬁcantly suppressed the growth of both transplantable and inducible melanoma. Initial studies
explored a combinatorial regimen using VISTA blockade and a peptide-based cancer vaccine with TLR agonists as
adjuvants. VISTA blockade synergized with the vaccine to effectively impair the growth of established tumors. Our
study therefore establishes a foundation for designing VISTA-targeted approaches either as a monotherapy or in
combination with additional immune-targeted strategies for cancer immunotherapy. Cancer Res; 74(7); 1933–44.

Introduction
Immune responses against cancer are negatively regulated
by multiple checkpoints, including CTLA-4, PD-L1/PD-1, and
B7-H4 pathways. Targeting of these negative immune regulators has proved to be a clinically effective strategy to enhance
tumor-speciﬁc immune responses (1, 2).
The critical role of T CTLA-4 in suppressing tumorspeciﬁc immunity was demonstrated when antibody-mediated CTLA-4 targeting in combination with a cellular vaccine induced regression of established, poorly immunogenic
B16 melanoma (3). Ipilimumab, an anti-human CTLA-4
monoclonal antibody (mAb), as a monotherapy has proved
to exert clinical beneﬁt in late-stage melanoma in patients
and has been approved for treating advanced melanoma,

as well as undergoing early-phase trials for other cancers
(4–6).
Programmed death-1 (PD-1) and its ligands PD-L1/PD-L2
represent another immune negative checkpoint axis (7, 8). The
PD-1 pathway downregulates tumor-speciﬁc immunity by
impairing T-cell responses and promoting the induction of
Foxp3þ Tregs in the periphery (1, 9). Blocking the PD-L1/PD-1
pathway, in conjunction with other immune therapies inhibits
tumor progression (10–15). MDX-1106/BMS-936558, the
human aPD-1 mAb, as well as a human aPD-L1 mAb, have
entered clinical trials, and early studies have shown resounding
clinical results (16–18).
Given the success of immune-checkpoint regulator blockade
in improving both endogenous and vaccine-elicited antitumor
immune responses, identiﬁcation of additional negative checkpoint regulator pathways would likely have important therapeutic implications. We have recently discovered a novel
immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily ligand, designated V-domain
Ig suppressor of T-cell activation (VISTA; Genbank: JN602184;
ref. 19). VISTA bears homology to PD-L1 but displays a distinct
expression pattern. Within the hematopoietic compartment,
VISTA is constitutively and highly expressed on CD11bhigh
myeloid cells, and expressed at lower levels on CD4þ and CD8þ
T cells and Foxp3þ Tregs. The human and murine homologs
share 90% homology, have indistinguishable functional properties, and are similar in their lineage restricted expression (20).
VISTA expressed on APCs directly suppresses CD4þ and CD8þ
T-cell proliferation and cytokine production (19).

We hypothesize that VISTA is a novel negative checkpoint
regulator and a promising new target for cancer immunotherapy. This study has utilized a VISTA-speciﬁc blocking mAb to
examine the role of VISTA in regulating antitumor immunity.
Our data show that VISTA mAb treatment impaired the
suppressive character of the tumor microenvironment (TME)
and enhanced protective antitumor immunity. Furthermore,
initial studies exploring a combination regimen of VISTA
blockade together with a peptide vaccine show synergistic
efﬁcacy. As such, our study establishes a foundation for
designing optimal therapeutic approaches that incorporate
VISTA blockade either as a monotherapy or in combination
with additional immune-targeted therapies.

Materials and Methods
Mice
C57BL/6 mice were from NCI. TRP1 and OTII CD4 transgenic mice were from the Jackson Laboratory. FoxP3-GFP
reporter mice were as described (21) and were generously
provided by Dr. Alexander Rudensky (University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA). The triple transgenic
mice strain B6.Cg-BrafCA/þ Ptenlox5/lox5 Tg (Tyr::Cre/ERT2) was
obtained from Dr. Bosenberg (Yale School of Medicine, New
Haven, CT). All animals were maintained in a pathogen-free
facility at Dartmouth Medical School. All animal protocols
were Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved
at the Dartmouth College.
Tumor models, tumor vaccine, and treatment
MB49 (300,000), B16OVA (120,000), and B16BL6 (18,000)
tumor cells were inoculated on the right ﬂank of female mice.
For the PTEN/BRAF melanoma model, tumors were induced
by intradermal injection of 10 mL tamoxifen (10 mL dissolved in
dimethyl sulfoxide) on the lower back. Tumor vaccine consisted of CD40 agonistic antibody FGK (100 mg), LPS (30 mg),
polyI:C (100 mg), CpG (ODN1826, 30 mg), Gardiquimod (30 mg),
tumor antigen peptide TRP1 (106–130; 100 mg), and a mutated
TRP2 peptide DeltaV-TRP2 (180–188; 100 mg; refs. 22–24).
Vaccine mixture was applied with split dose subcutaneously
on indicated days. For prophylactic anti-VISTA mAb treatment, mice were treated every 2 days with 300 mg antibody
subcutaneously, starting on day 0 for the entire duration of the
experiment. For therapeutic treatment, mice were treated with
subcutaneous injection of 300 mg mAb every day for 10 days on
dayþ2 or dayþ7 after tumor inoculation, followed by continuous antibody injection every 2 days for the entire duration of
the experiment.
Flow cytometry and analysis
Flow cytometry analysis was performed either on FACSCAN
using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences) or on MACSquant 7
color analyzer (Miltenyi). Data analysis was performed using
FlowJo software (Treestar).
Graphs and statistical analysis
All graphs and statistical analysis were generated using Prism
4 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). A Student t test (two-tailed) was
used for the data analyses.  , P < 0.005;  , P < 0.025;  , P < 0.05.

Results
VISTA mAb treatment impairs tumor growth in
immunogenic transplantable tumor models
We have previously generated a hamster monoclonal antibody (clone 13F3) that neutralizes the suppressive activity of
VISTA (19). We hypothesized that VISTA mAb-mediated
blockade would enhance antitumor immune responses. This
hypothesis was tested in murine tumor models. We ﬁrst
examined the immunogenicity and in vivo clearance of 13F3
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Our data show that mice developed
strong immune response against 13F3 and accumulated high
levels neutralizing antibodies, which presumably leads to fast
clearance of 13F3. In fact, after a week of continuous treatment,
we can no longer detect any 13F3 in the serum when blood was
analyzed 24 hours after each injection. Our data indicates that
the most effective window of 13F3-mediated VISTA blockade
in vivo might be within the ﬁrst week of treatment.
Next, we examined the impact of VISTA mAb treatment in
mice bearing melanoma B16OVA, which expresses the chicken
ovalbumin as a neo tumor antigen. Despite the apparent immunogenicity and short half-life of 13F3 in vivo, 13F3 treatment
signiﬁcantly suppressed tumor growth in the B16OVA model
(Fig. 1A). Increased number of IFN-g–producing cells in the
tumor-draining lymph node was detected by ELISPOT assay in
response to irradiated tumor cells, indicating that VISTA mAb
treatment enhanced tumor-speciﬁc T-cell responses. Even
though we cannot detect any expression of VISTA on nonhematopoietic cells, we examined in vitro cultured tumor cells to
exclude the possibility that VISTA mAb directly affected tumor
cell proliferation and apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S2).
VISTA mAb treatment alters the cellular composition of
the tumor immune microenvironment
The TME plays a crucial role in suppressing tumor-speciﬁc
T-cell responses (25, 26). VISTA is found to be highly expressed
on tumor-inﬁltrating myeloid cells, including myeloid DCs
(CD11bþ CD11cþGr1) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells
(CD11bþGr1þCD11C), but is not expressed on B16 tumor
cells (Fig. 1B–D). This expression pattern is in contrast to PDL1, which is expressed on both tumor cells and tumor-inﬁltrating leukocytes (TIL; Fig. 1C).
VISTA mAb treatment altered the TIL composition in the
B16OVA model. aVISTA administration increased total
CD45þ leukocytes tumor inﬁltration from 25.77%  5.95% to
57.78%  3.97% (Fig. 1E). Within the TIL CD45þ population, a
decreased percentage of CD11bþGr1þCD11C MDSCs (from
37.74%  2.44% to 25.64%  0.93%), and increased percentages
of tumor-speciﬁc CD4þ T cells (from 6.38%  0.27% to 11.74%
 0.97%) and CD8þ T cells (from 9.25%  0.95% to 17.74% 
0.41%) were seen with aVISTA treatment. Tumor-inﬁltrating
CD8þ T cells expressed phenotypes of CD44hiCD62Llow (data
not shown), produced effector molecules (i.e., IFN-g and
granzyme B), and mobilized CD107ab upon restimulation
with irradiated tumor cells ex vivo, indicating that these
tumor-inﬁltrating T cells contained tumor-speciﬁc effector

T-cell populations (Fig. 1F–H). VISTA mAb administration
enhanced the proliferation and the effector function of
tumor-inﬁltrating CD8þ T cells, as evidenced by increased
number of Ki67þ cells, enhanced effector molecule production (i.e., IFN-g and granzyme B), and CD107 mobilization
(Fig. 1F–H and Supplementary Fig. S1). There are no significant alterations of myeloid cells and T-cell lineages in the
spleen or tumor-draining lymph nodes upon VISTA mAb
treatment (data not shown), indicating that VISTA mAb did
not induce antibody-mediated deletion of VISTAþ cells.
VISTA blockade therefore appears to act predominantly on
altering the TME by enhancing the frequency of tumorinﬁltrating effector T cells as well as their effector functions,
resulting in enhanced control of tumor growth.
Similar analysis was performed in an immunogenic bladder
tumor model MB49 (27). Consistent with that observed in the
melanoma model, VISTA mAb treatment signiﬁcantly suppressed MB49 tumor growth (Fig. 2A). Similar to the B16OVA
model, VISTA is highly expressed on tumor-inﬁltrating myeloid cell populations (Fig. 2B). Unlike the B16OVA tumors,
VISTA mAb treatment in MB49 tumors did not reduce the
relative percentage of MDSCs within the CD45þ TILs. Further
analysis indicated that more than 90% of the MDSC populations inﬁltrating MB49 tumors were of the granulocytic phenotype (Cd11bþGr1hiLy6GþLy6C-int), which is in contrast to
the predominant monocytic MDSC populations (Cd11bþGr1int
Ly6GLy6Chi) inﬁltrating B16 melanoma (Supplementary Fig.
S3). Despite the unaltered presence of MDSCs, VISTA mAb
enhanced the activation status of tumor-associated CD11cþ
DCs, which showed higher expression of MCHII and CD80, and
higher production of interleukin (IL)-12 and TNF-a (Fig. 2D). In
aVISTA–treated mice, tumor-speciﬁc T-cell responses were
signiﬁcantly enhanced, both in the tumor-draining lymph node
and within the tumor tissue (Fig. 2).
Because both B16OVA and MB49 tumors express neoantigens that elicit strong immune responses, we sought to evaluate whether VISTA blockade might impact on the growth of
poorly immunogenic tumors, such as the B16BL6 melanoma.
VISTA mAb in this model treatment signiﬁcantly delayed
tumor growth (Fig. 3A). Similar to the B16OVA model, reduction of tumor-inﬁltrating monocytic MDSCs and increase of
tumor-inﬁltrating CD4þ and CD8þ T cells were observed upon
VISTA mAb treatment (Fig. 3B). To determine whether VISTA
mAb could directly promote T-cell inﬁltration to tumor tissues,
we tracked the tumor-inﬁltration of TRP1 TCR transgenic
CD4þ T cells that are speciﬁc for the melanoma antigen
tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TRP1), in B16 tumor-bearing
mice. Our data show that VISTA mAb treatment signiﬁcantly
enhanced tumor inﬁltration of TRP1 transgenic CD4þ T cells
(Fig. 3C). Phenotypic analysis of tumor-inﬁltrating polyclonal
populations of CD4þ and CD8þ T cells demonstrated heightened activation status upon VISTA blockade, which was evidenced by enhanced Ki67þ cells and heightened frequency of
cells bearing a CD44hiCD62Llow surface phenotype (Fig. 3D).
When restimulated with BMDCs pulsed with tumor antigens in
vitro, TIL CD4þ and CD8þ T cells produced enhanced levels of
effector molecules (IFN-g and/or granzyme B; Fig. 3E). Consistent with the MB49 model, tumor-inﬁltrating CD11cþ DCs

www.aacrjournals.org

expressed higher level of MHCII and CD80, as well as inﬂammatory cytokines IL-12 and TNF-a (Fig. 3F). Taken together,
these results demonstrated the ability of VISTA mAb to alter
the suppressive signature of the TME and promote tumorspeciﬁc effector T-cell function, which likely contributed to
reduced tumor growth.
VISTA regulates the induction of Foxp3þ iTregs from
na€ve CD4þ T cells as well as the suppressive activity of
nTregs
Our previous study showed that VISTA-Ig fusion protein
directly suppressed T-cell activation by inhibiting T-cell
proliferative responses and cytokine production (19). Our
current data show that VISTA-Ig promoted the induction of
Foxp3þCD4þ regulatory T cells (iTregs) in the presence of
TGF-b in vitro (Fig. 4C). This effect is also seen on human
CD4þ T cells treated with human-VISTA-Ig fusion protein in
vitro (manuscript submitted). Tregs induced by VISTA-Ig
obtained similar suppressive activity in vitro when compared
with control iTregs (Fig. 4C). To validate the role of VISTA on
promoting the differentiation of iTregs, we examined the
effect of VISTA mAb treatment on the induction of tumorspeciﬁc iTregs, as previously described (9). Na€ve OVAspeciﬁc OTII CD4þ T cells (puriﬁed from Foxp3GFP reporter
mice as CD25CD62Lhi Foxp3GFP) were adoptively transferred into sublethally irradiated host bearing the B16OVA
tumor. Mice were treated with either control-Ig or VISTA
mAb. The induction of Foxp3GFPþ OTII iTreg cells in the
tumor-draining lymph node and within the tumor tissue was
examined when tumors reached >8 mm diameter (approximately day 20). As shown in Fig. 4D, VISTA blockade
signiﬁcantly diminished the percentage of Foxp3GFPþ
iTregs within the tumor-inﬁltrating OTII transgenic CD4þ
T-cell population (from 61.51%  5.71% to 35.75%  7.09%).
Similar reduction was seen in the tumor-draining lymph
node (from 3.51%  0.49% to 1.75%  0.25%).
VISTA expression level on tumor-inﬁltrating Tregs is
higher than Tregs from peripheral lymph nodes (Fig. 4B),
indicating that VISTA expressed on Tregs within the TME
might play a role in suppressing tumor-speciﬁc immunity.
Studies were developed to functionally assess whether
VISTA mAb-mediated blockade impaired the suppressive
function of Tregs. Thymus-derived natural Tregs (nTregs)
contain different subsets that are distinguished by surface
markers. Our analysis show that VISTA is more highly
expressed on CD62L and ICOS Treg subsets, when compared with CD62Lþ and ICOSþ Treg subsets (Fig. 4A; refs. 28,
29). No difference of VISTA expression was observed on
other Treg subsets based on surface markers such as CD25,
GITR, CD73, Folate receptor 4, and IL-7 receptor (data not
shown). Treg subsets were sorted from na€ve mice based on
markers ICOS and CD62L and tested for their suppressive
activity in vitro. VISTA mAb enhanced naive target T-cell
proliferation in the presence of all the Treg subsets tested.
This data indicates that VISTA blockade might directly
impair the suppressive activity of Tregs. Notably, VISTA
mAb also enhanced T-cell proliferation in the absence
of Tregs, indicating an alternative possibility that VISTA

administration in an inducible melanoma model. This model
relies on the interbreeding of three transgenic mouse lines (30):
(i) BrafCA, which carries a conditional BrafV600E allele. (ii)
Ptenlox5, which carries a conditional allele of Pten, permitting Cre-mediated deletion. (iii) Tyr::Cre/ERT2, which carries
a 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT)-inducible CreERT2 allele,
allowing melanocyte-speciﬁc inducible expression of Cre.
The triple mutant mice, B6.Cg-BrafCA/þ Ptenlox5/lox5 Tg (Tyr::
Cre/ERT2), develop pigmented skin lesions upon topical
treatment of 4-OHT within 21 days, which quickly progress
to malignant melanoma (Fig. 5A). Analysis of tumor-inﬁltrating leukocytes reveals high levels of VISTA expression on
tumor-associated myeloid cells (Fig. 5B). No VISTA expression was observed on tumor cells, whereas some level of PDL1 expression was detected (Fig. 5C). Importantly, VISTA
mAb treatment signiﬁcantly delayed tumor progression (Fig.

5A). Further analysis of TIL populations demonstrated similar alterations of TME as shown in the transplantable B16
tumor models, including increased tumor inﬁltration of T
cells, decreased tumor-inﬁltration of myeloid cells, and
enhanced IFN-g production of tumor-inﬁltrating CD8þ T
lymphocytes (Fig. 5D–F).
VISTA mAb synergizes with a tumor vaccine to achieve

Although VISTA mAb as a single-agent therapy delayed
tumor progression, it was not curative under the conditions
tested. In an attempt to increase the magnitude of the tumorspeciﬁc immune response, a peptide-based cancer vaccine was
used in combination with VISTA blockade. Based on previous
melanoma vaccine studies from our lab (R.J. Noelle) and others
(31–34), we applied a modiﬁed vaccine platform containing the

agonistic CD40 antibody FGK, TLR agonists, and tumor antigen peptides. Both a MHCI-restricted mutant TRP2 peptide
and a MHCII-restricted TRP1 peptide were incorporated (22–
24). Early therapeutic intervention on 2-day tumors using a
combinatorial therapy of aVISTA mAb and a single dose of
peptide vaccine effectively eradicated tumors in a majority of
mice, whereas either reagent alone only transiently impaired
tumor growth without signiﬁcant survival beneﬁt (Fig. 6A).
Combinatorial treatment of 7-day established tumors (with
average tumor diameter 3mm) showed signiﬁcant suppression of tumor growth and led to approximately 30% long-term
survival, whereas monotherapy had little effect (Fig. 6B). A
prime-boost vaccine regimen was applied on dayþ7 and þ14
for treating 7-day established tumors, and showed better longterm survival (from 10% to 30%) than a single vaccine dose in
this setting (Fig. S6). Tumor-inﬁltrating T cells showed syner-

gistically enhanced responses against immunizing peptide,
indicating that the development of T-cell–mediated immune
responses might be critical for the efﬁcacy of the combination
therapy (Fig. 6C). Additional evidence supporting this hypothesis is provided by the loss of therapeutic efﬁcacy upon
predepletion of CD8þ T cells, or when treating immunedeﬁcient tumor-bearing Rag/ hosts (Supplementary Fig.
S7). This data is consistent with the mechanisms of action
associated with CD40/TLR-based vaccines (31–34). A second
tumor challenge of survivors at day þ60 post-treatment
showed delayed tumor growth (8/12) or no tumor growth
(4/12), indicating that certain levels of T-cell memory was
developed during the combination therapy (Fig. 6D). The
protection rate for the rechallenge did not improve regardless
whether a second boost vaccine was introduced during the
primary tumor challenge (data not shown). These studies set

Discussion
Our study introduces a new negative immune-checkpoint
regulator, VISTA, whose expression within the TME plays a
critical role in regulating protective immunity to cancer. Our
data show that aVISTA monotherapy impairs tumor growth in
multiple tumor models. We have dissected the multiple

mechanisms whereby VISTA mAb-mediated blockade enhances antitumor immune responses.
First, VISTA mAb enhanced tumor-speciﬁc T-cell response,
both in the periphery and within the TME. VISTA is constitutively highly expressed on myeloid cells, with even higher
densities observed within the TME. This data suggests that
VISTA may be abundantly present within the TME of any solid
tumor types that are inﬁltrated with myeloid cells and T cells,
indicating a broad clinical applicability for VISTA-blockade
therapy. The high expression of VISTA on myeloid cells

within the TME suggests that VISTA might directly suppress
tumor-inﬁltrating effector T cells. This hypothesis is supported by enhanced proliferation, activation, and effector
function of tumor-inﬁltrating T cells in VISTA mAb-treated
mice (Figs. 1–3). We have not detected VISTA expression on
tumor cells investigated. As such, we predict that VISTA
targeted immunotherapy will be effective independent of its
expression on tumors. Similarly restricted hematopoietic
expression of human VISTA has been observed in human
melanoma, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer (data not
shown). In contrast, PD-L1 is known to be expressed at
high levels on nonhematopoietic tumor cells (Fig. 1;
refs. 2, 35). It is therefore clinically relevant that VISTA mAb
demonstrated efﬁcacy despite the high levels of PD-L1
within the TME. Our future studies will compare the efﬁcacy

Figure 6. VISTA mAb synergized
with tumor vaccine to impair the

tumors. Naïve mice (n ¼ 13 per
group for A and n ¼ 8–10 per group
for B) were inoculated with B16BL6 tumor cells (18,000) on the
right ﬂank. On dayþ2 (A) or dayþ7
(B) postinoculations, mice were

complex (1 dose) or anti-VISTA

for the entire duration of the

the combination therapy induced

tumor-bearing mice were treated
on dayþ7 with vaccine or 13F3 or
the combination as indicated.
Tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes

of VISTA-blockade with PD1 blockade and deﬁne synergistic
treatment regimens for the remission of established tumors.
Second, VISTA blockade impaired the suppressive effect of
natural Tregs and the differentiation of tumor-speciﬁc iTregs
(Fig. 4). It remains to be determined whether VISTA expression
on Tregs directly contributes to their suppressive function,
even though VISTA neutralization in vitro failed to show any
direct effect on Treg proliferation, apoptosis, and Foxp3 stability on in vitro cultured Tregs (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Alternatively, it is possible that VISTA neutralization might
enhance na€ve T-cell proliferation, making them more resistant to Treg-mediated suppression. Future studies will utilize VISTAKO mice to tease out the underlying mechanisms
whereby VISTA regulates the suppressive function of Tregs.
In this context, both CTLA-4 and PD-1 impact on either the

suppressive function and/or the peripheral induction of
Foxp3þ Tregs (9, 36–38).
Third, in the B16 melanoma model, VISTA blockade
altered the suppressive cellular signature of the TME, by
reducing the tumor-inﬁltrating monocytic MDSCs while
increasing the frequency of inﬁltrating effector T cells.
Because there is no apparent deletion of both myeloid
lineages and T-cell lineages in the periphery upon VISTA
mAb treatment (data not shown), such alterations within the
tumor tissue likely reﬂect either the impaired migration of
monocytic MDSCs into tumor tissues, or impaired inﬁltration of immature myeloid progenitor cells, which might
differentiate into MDSCs at tumor site (39, 40). In contrast
to melanoma, VISTA blockade did not signiﬁcantly alter the
inﬁltration of the granuolytic MDSC population within the
MB49 bladder tumors. This intriguing result might indicate
different mechanisms whereby VISTA regulates monocytic
and granuolytic myelopoiesis during tumor development.
In addition to affecting MDSCs, VISTA blockade directly
enhanced the migration of tumor-speciﬁc effector T cells (i.e.,
TRP1 Tg CD4þ T cells) into tumor tissue (Fig. 3). Furthermore,
VISTA blockade enhanced the immune-stimulatory phenotype
of TIL DCs, which showed higher expression levels of MHCII
and CD80, and cytokine production (i.e., IL-12 and TNF-a; Figs.
2 and 3). Collectively, these multiple effects of VISTA mAb
treatment facilitate the establishment of an immune-stimulatory TME, which lead to enhanced antitumor immunity.
It is clear that combination immunotherapy for cancer
using multiple biologics will be critical for improving the
therapeutic outcome. In addition to the monotherapeutic
targeting of negative checkpoint regulators, combining multiple checkpoint blockades, or combining checkpoint blockade with chemotherapy or cancer vaccines is moving into
clinical trials. Some examples of such combinatorial
approaches include CTLA4 blockade combined with GVax
or Flt3vax (3, 41), CTLA4 blockade combined with PD-L1/
PD1 blockade (42, 43), PD1 blockade combined with vaccine
(44, 45). Our initial studies explore a combination regimen
using VISTA blockade together with a peptide vaccine (22–
24, 33). Our data show promising synergistic effects for
treating both 2-day and 7-day established tumors. Future
studies will focus on elucidating the cellular and molecular
mechanisms of such synergy, as well as determining the
limitations of this combination platform and strategies for
improvement. For example, the use of deﬁned peptides
might lead to loss-of-antigen escape variants (46). The
delivery of vaccine component might be optimized through
the use of nanoparticles or other particulate formulations or
TLR-peptide conjugates (47–49). Additional immune-suppressive pathways (i.e., other immune checkpoint pathways
such as PD-1, and immune suppressive cytokines) might be

blocked to achieve better long-term tumor-speciﬁc memory
T-cell responses. Furthermore, the immunogenicity and the
FcR binding activity of the VISTA mAb might be critical
limiting factors for achieving optimal target neutralization
and therapeutic efﬁcacy, thus warrant future studies (50, 51).
Recent breakthroughs using CTLA-4 and PD-1 checkpoint
blockade have reinvigorated the ﬁeld of cancer immunotherapy (2, 35). Multiple checkpoints control the development of
antitumor immunity, each with their own unique signature
and mechanisms. Our studies provide compelling evidence
supporting the role of VISTA as a negative immune checkpoint regulator that controls immunity against cancer. Taken
together with the ﬁndings that VISTA expression and function
on human leukocytes and within the human tumors have
recapitulated the murine data (20), we present VISTA as a
promising new target for cancer immunotherapy, either as a
single target or in combination with other immunotherapeutic
strategies.
