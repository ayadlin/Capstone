Abstract
Ampliﬁcation of chromosome 8q22, which includes the gene for lysosomal associated transmembrane protein
LAPTM4B, has been linked to de novo anthracycline resistance in primary breast cancers with poor prognosis.
LAPTM4B overexpression can induce cytosolic retention of anthracyclines and decrease drug-induced DNA
damage. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that LAPTM4B may contribute to tumor cell growth or survival in
the absence of a chemotherapeutic exposure. In mammary cells, LAPTM4B protein was localized in lysosomes
where its depletion increased membrane permeability, pH, cathepsin release, and cellular apoptosis. Loss of
LAPTM4B also inhibited later stages of autophagy by blocking maturation of the autophagosome, thereby
rendering cells more sensitive to nutrient deprivation or hypoxia. Conversely, enforced overexpression of
LAPTM4B promoted autophagic ﬂux and cell survival during in vitro starvation and stimulated more rapid
tumor growth in vivo. Together, our results indicate that LAPTM4B is required for lysosome homeostasis,
acidiﬁcation, and function, and that LAPTM4B renders tumor cells resistant to lysosome-mediated cell death
triggered by environmental and genotoxic stresses. Cancer Res; 71(24); 7481–9. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Chemoresistance is often an acquired characteristic of
recurrent tumors either induced or selected by exposure to
a drug. Alternatively, de novo drug resistance can occur due to
intrinsic features of the primary tumor which are selected by
contributing a proliferative or survival advantage to tumor
cells. The possible mechanisms of chemoresistance may
include altered drug uptake, intracellular distribution, efﬂux,
and turnover. Lysosomal retention of drugs is associated with
drug resistance and lysosomal concentration of anthracyclines
is thought to increase drug efﬂux and decrease drug nuclear
localization, thereby preventing effective chemotherapyinduced DNA damage (1).
Lysosomes are organelles that contain hydrolytic enzymes
such as proteases, nucleases, and lipases. Lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) can pose a threat to cellular
homeostasis through release of lysosomal contents and is a
recognized trigger of cell death (2). For example, a selective and
limited release of lysosomal cathepsins B or D may activate the
mitochondrial cell death pathway by either generating reactive

oxygen species and lipid mediators or triggering mitochondrial
outer membrane permeabilization. Cathepsin B is a major
mediator of apoptotic pathways activating the proapoptotic
protein Bid by truncation. Truncated Bid (tBid) translocates to
mitochondria to active the caspase cascade and promotes
apoptosis. Cathepsin D is an aspartate protease that directly
activates caspase (3, 4). The current knowledge of the proteins
on lysosomal membranes critical for affecting or regulating
these various lysosomal functions is limited.
Autophagy is a conserved lysosome-mediated intracellular
trafﬁcking pathway that degrades and recycles intracellular
components (5). Autophagy is also a homeostatic mechanism
that regulates metabolism and energy production and may be
upregulated in response to a variety of cell stresses (5–7). As
cancers develop and disseminate, the process of autophagy
(autophagy ﬂux) may be upregulated to support tumor cell
survival and allow tumors to adapt to these stresses (8–10). In
addition, autophagy has been shown to promote cell survival in
response to chemotherapeutic agents (11–13). Conversely, too
much autophagy may catabolize essential components resulting in autophagic cell death (14, 15). Autophagy is regulated by
a signaling cascade involving mTOR pathway inhibition, the
autophagy proteins (Atgs), and two ubiquitin-like conjugation
systems (16–20). During autophagy initiation, a portion of the
cytosol is surrounded by a cisternal membrane, the phagophore (21), that closes to form a double-membraned vesicle,
the autophagosome (22). During autophagosome formation,
cytosolic LC3 is cleaved by a protease and then conjugated to
phosphatidylethanolamine to form autophagosomal membrane–associated LC3II (23); the level of LC3II correlates with
the number of autophagosomes (24, 25). After their formation,
autophagosomes fuse with endosomes to form amphisomes

(26, 27) and then with lysosomes to form autolysosomes where
sequestered material is degraded (5, 28–30). Blockade of
autophagosome maturation and fusion with the lysosomal
compartment results in accumulation of autophagosomes and
interruption in the ﬂux of material through the autophagic
pathway (31). Autophagic ﬂux can be monitored by measuring
the level of substrates normally degraded by autophagy such as
p62/SQSTM1 (25). The p62 protein is a ubiquitin-binding
scaffold protein that binds directly to LC3 and is itself degraded
in autolysosomes (32). Inhibition of autophagic degradation
results in an increase in p62 levels and increased autophagy
ﬂux is indicated by decreased p62 levels (33). Many molecules
have been implicated in these later stages of autophagosome
maturation (30).
Lysosomal associated protein transmembrane-4 b
(LAPTM4B) is a putative novel oncogene (34, 35) frequently
ampliﬁed and overexpressed in primary treatment-naive
breast cancers (36). Like other LAPTM family members,
LAPTM4B protein has a lysosome localization motif (34) and
colocalizes with markers of late endosomes and lysosomes
(37). Increased expression of LAPTM4B has been shown in
hepatocellular carcinoma and lung, ovarian, uterine, and gastric cancers (35, 38–40). Overexpression of the LAPTM4B-35
isoform in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines promotes apoptosis resistance in vitro and growth and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma xenografts in mice (41). We reported
overexpression of LAPTM4B in primary breast tumors is
associated with resistance to chemotherapy, speciﬁcally
anthracyclines, and may serve as a predictive biomarker for
distant recurrence in patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy (36). By sequestering drug in the cytoplasmic compartment and enhancing efﬂux of drugs from cancer cells,
overexpression of LAPTM4B decreases nuclear localization of
drug and drug-induced DNA damage and thereby reduces drug
effectiveness (36, 42). However, the potential mechanisms by
which LAPTM4B promotes tumor growth and survival in
treatment-naive cancers is not well studied.
This study tests the effect of modulating LAPTM4B expression on cell survival under various stress conditions including
nutrient deprivation, pH alteration, hypoxia, chemotherapy
exposure, and in vivo tumor growth. Our results show that high
expression of LAPTM4B inhibits lysosome-mediated death
pathways, promotes autophagy, and leads to stress tolerance,
thereby enhancing tumor cell growth and survival. LAPTM4B
may be an important new therapeutic target for inhibiting
cancer growth or sensitizing tumors to chemotherapy.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, siRNA transfection, and gene transfer
Breast cell lines BT549 and MDA-MB-468 were obtained
from American Type Culture Collection and were authenticated by Promega PowerPlex 1.2 short tandem repeat proﬁling.
Tert-immortalized human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC)
were from Clontech and provided by the Zhao laboratory.
BT549 cancer cells have ampliﬁcation and overexpression of
LAPTM4B (43) and were used for siRNA knockdown experiments. MDA-MB-468 (MDA468) cancer cells have normal DNA

copy number and expression of LAPTM4B (43) and were
chosen for LAPTM4B transfection for overexpression and
tumor xenograft experiments. Cell culture condition, siRNA
transfection, expression construct carrying LAPTM4B cDNA,
and stable transfer of this construct into MDA468 were conducted as described (36).
Analysis of LMP
Cells were transfected with control and LAPTM4B siRNA.
After 48 hours, control and LAPTM4B expression–modiﬁed
cells were incubated with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)labeled dextrans of different molecular weights from 4, 40, and
70 kDa (Sigma) for 2 or 12 hours, followed by wash out of excess
dextran with culture medium, examination on a Zeiss HAL100
ﬂuorescence microscope and photographed with a Zeiss
camera.
Tumorigenicity assay
Two groups of mice were injected with LAPTM4B expression–manipulated MDA468 cells or the control counterpart
cells into the inguinal mammary fat pads. Mice were routinely
monitored for health and tumor size; mice were sacriﬁced
when tumors reached 2 cm. Tumor growth rates were measured and compared between LAPTM4B-manipulated and
control tumors. LAPTM4B expression level and the autophagosome marker LC3 were measured by immunoblot in tumor
lysates prepared from xenograft tumors.
Statistical analysis
Difference in cell viability, tumor size, and ratios of LC3II/
LC3I, or of p62/actin between control and testing groups was
evaluated by the Student t test and P values derived from this
test were used to determine the signiﬁcance of the difference.
Additional methods are described in Supplementary
Material.

Results
LAPTM4B localizes to lysosomes and downregulation of
LAPTM4B triggers LMP
LAPTM4B is a member of a family of proteins which contain
a lysosome targeting motif at the C terminus (34). To determine lysosome localization in mammary epithelial cells, we
examined HMECs stably expressing exogenous 6-His epitope–
tagged LAPTM4B by immunoﬂuorescence microscopy and
showed expression of His-LAPTM4B in the lysosomal compartment deﬁned by the lysosome-marker Lysotracker DND99 (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
To understand how LAPTM4B might modulate lysosome
function, we investigated the relationship between LAPTM4B
expression and LMP. LMP was evaluated by measuring endocytic uptake and release of a nondigestible ﬂuid-phase substrate, FITC-dextran. In BT549 breast cancer cells transfected
with a scramble control siRNA, after 2 hours of exposure to
FITC-dextran, the ﬂuorescent dextran particles were detected
in a punctate cytoplasmic pattern consistent with lysosomes
and were retained in the lysosomal compartment 12 hours
later (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B). In BT549 cells

transfected with LAPTM4B-speciﬁc siRNA, the ﬂuorescence
pattern was similar to control cells at 2 hours; however, after 12
hours, the 4 and 40 kDa FITC-dextran molecules were in a
diffuse distribution throughout the cell consistent with release
from the lysosomal compartment (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig.
S2C and S2D). The distribution of the larger molecular weight
70 kDa FITC-dextrans were mostly unchanged after 12 hours
(Fig. 1B, bottom). These results suggest that LAPTM4B exerts
lysosome-stabilizing properties to retain low and intermediate
molecular weight macromolecules. Doxorubicin is small molecule with a molecular weight of approximately 580 Da. As
shown in Fig. 1C, after 2 hours of drug exposure, doxorubicin
autoﬂuorescence is colocalized with Lysotracker in both the
control-treated and LAPTM4B-siRNA–treated BT549 cells
consistent with initial uptake of drug into lysosomes. Doxorubicin is retained in the lysosomal compartment 24 hours
later in the control siRNA–treated or untreated BT549 cells
(Fig. 1D, top; Supplementary Fig. S1B). However, in the BT549

cells treated with LAPTM4B-siRNA, after 12 to 24 hours,
doxorubicin has been redistributed and predominantly colocalizes with nuclear 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)
staining (Fig. 1D, bottom). This result suggests that knockdown
of LAPTM4B does not completely abolish the uptake of doxorubicin by cytoplasmic organelles but signiﬁcantly weakens the
capability of lysosomes to retain the drug, resulting in its more
rapid release and redistribution to the nucleus.
Doxorubicin is also a weak base that can be trapped in
acidiﬁed lysosomes. To examine whether LAPTM4B expression has an effect on lysosomal pH, we used a pH sensing dye,
LysoSensor Green DND-189, which is taken up into lysosomes
and ﬂuoresces with greater intensity in lower pH. As shown
in Fig. 2A, BT549 cells treated with LAPTM4B-siRNA have a
higher lysosomal pH (lower ﬂuorescent intensity) than control
cells. The degree of increase in lysosomal pH is similar to BT549
cells treated with 50 mmol/L chloroquine, a lysosomotropic
agent that increases the lysosomal pH (Fig. 2B). However,

Figure 3. Suppression of LAPTM4B induces cathepsin-dependent cleavage of Bid, caspase-3, and PARP in breast cancer cells that overexpress LAPTM4B.
A, BT549 cells transfected with a scrambled control siRNA (Ctrl) or LAPTM4B-speciﬁc siRNA (L4B siRNA) incubated in medium alone (—) or with
1 mmol/L doxorubicin (Doxo). Proteins (100 mg per lane) from cytosol preparations were fractionated on SDS-PAGE; blots were probed with anti-cathepsins B,
D, and anti-actin. B, BT549 cells pretreated with cathepsin inhibitors, pepstatin A and EST (Cath inh), or pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK
(Casp inh) then transfected with control or LAPTM4B-speciﬁc siRNA and treated with medium alone (—) or 1 mmol/L doxorubicin (Doxo). Proteins
(100 mg per lane) from cell lysates were fractionated on SDS-PAGE; blots were probed with anti-Bid, anti-caspase-3, anti-PARP, and anti-actin antibodies.

SKBR3 breast cancer cells with forced stable overexpression of
LAPTM4B had similar lysosomal pH compared with control
cells (Fig. 2C). To determine whether change in lysosomal pH
alone could account for increased permeability of the lysosome, we treated BT549 cells with 50 mmol/L chloroquine to
increase lysosomal pH and found no alteration in the uptake of
dextran at 2 hours and dextran was not released into the
cytosol at 12 hours (Supplementary Fig. S2E and S2F). These
results suggest that LAPTM4B may not directly regulate lysosomal pH, but the increase of lysosomal pH in LAPTM4B
knockdown cells may be a secondary effect of increased LMP
resulting in deacidiﬁcation of the lysosome.
Knockdown of LAPTM4B by siRNA provokes lysosomal
mediated programmed cell death through induction of
cathepsin release
The maintenance of lysosomal membrane integrity is important for cell survival. LMP leads to cathepsin release followed
by caspase activation. This process initiates apoptosis which
triggers further lysosomal destabilization to induce lysosomal
mediated cell death in a positive feedback loop (2). To determine whether LAPTM4B knockdown led to cathepsin release
from lysosomes, we conducted immunoblot analysis for cathepsins on cell cytosol fractions of BT549 tumor cells after
transfection with control or LAPTM4B-speciﬁc siRNA. Depletion of LAPTM4B resulted in appearance of cathepsin B and
cathepsin D in the cytosol of cells (Fig. 3A) and resulted in Bid
truncation, caspase-3 activation, and PARP cleavage (Fig. 3B)
consistent with initiation of apoptosis. Pan inhibitors of cathepsins (EST and pepstatin A) protected BT549 cells from
LAPTM4B knockdown–induced Bid truncation and apoptosis.
The pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK was sufﬁcient to abro-

gate caspase-3 activation but did not prevent Bid truncation.
Treatment with 50 mmol/L chloroquine alone was not sufﬁcient to induce cathepsin release and resulted in no added
effect to LAPTM4B knockdown on cathepsin release or apoptosis induction (Supplementary Fig. S3, lanes 4 and 8). However, the release of cathepsin B and D and the activation of
caspase-3 were more pronounced in cells also treated with the
DNA-damaging drug, doxorubicin (Fig. 3A and B; Supplementary Fig. S3, lanes 2 and 6). There was no potentiation of
cathepsin release or caspase-3 activation in cells also treated
with the microtubule-stabilizing agent taxol (Supplementary
Fig. S3, lanes 3 and 7), consistent with previous studies showing
that taxol-induced apoptosis may be independent of caspase-3
and -9 activation (44). These results suggest that a certain level
of LAPTM4B is required to prevent lysosome-mediated initiation of apoptosis. This requirement is more notable in the
setting of additional cellular insult, such as exposure to certain
chemotherapy agents.
LAPTM4B overexpression promotes autophagy
Autophagy plays a critical survival role by supporting
energy requirements and sustaining viability under adverse
conditions and may also promote resistance to chemotherapy-induced genotoxic stress. To determine whether modulation of LAPTM4B expression has an effect on autophagy,
we examined markers of autophagosome maturation and
ﬂux during starvation-induced autophagy in BT549 breast
cancer cells with or without depletion of LAPTM4B. In
parental BT549 cells (with inherent overexpression of
LAPTM4B), autophagy was induced by starvation as indicated by the appearance of punctate LC3 staining in the
cytoplasm. Many of the LC3-puncta colocalized with the

maturation and fusion to lysosomes (Fig. 4A). In contrast, in
cells in which LAPTM4B has been depleted by siRNA,
starvation resulted in marked cytoplasmic accumulation of
enlarged LC3-positive autophagosomes, some of which were
not colocalized with LAMP2-positive lysosomes (Fig. 4B).
This suggests that depletion of LAPTM4B resulted in a block
in autophagosome–lysosome fusion and blocked autolysosome formation.
We next analyzed autophagy in these cells by immunoblotting for LC3II and p62. The siRNA depletion of LAPTM4B had
no effect on the level of LC3II in BT549 cells grown in nutrientrich medium but resulted in signiﬁcant increase in the level of
LC3II when cells were stressed by serum starvation (Fig. 4C;
Supplementary Fig. S4A). LC3II is an indicator of autophago-

some number which can increase due to increased autophagosome formation or from a block in autophagosome maturation
or both (31). To determine whether autophagy ﬂux was
increased or blocked, we measured levels of the autophagy
substrate, p62. In control cells, serum starvation increased
autophagy ﬂux as indicated by lower p62 levels in the serumstarved cells than in cells grown in nutrient-rich medium.
However, in cells depleted of LAPTM4B, there was no change
in the level of p62 after serum starvation, indicating a block in
starvation-induced autophagy ﬂux (Fig. 4C; Supplementary
Fig. S4B). The effect of knockdown of LAPTM4B on LC3II and
p62 levels was similar to what was observed in serum-starved
cells treated with chloroquine. In conjunction with the immunoﬂuorescence ﬁndings, these results suggest that LAPTM4B
is required for the later stages of autophagy maturation in

Overexpression of LAPTM4B promotes tumor cell
survival and resistance to apoptosis induced by low
serum concentration or glucose deprivation
The previous experiments suggest that overexpression of
LAPTM4B may result in decreased sensitivity of tumor cells to
insults that trigger LMP, lysosome-mediated programmed cell
death, or induce autophagy. We examined the effect of modulating LAPTM4B expression levels on cell survival in cells
exposed to various environmental stressors. In BT549 cells
with ampliﬁcation and overexpression of LAPTM4B, siRNA
depletion of LAPTM4B resulted in approximately 50% decrease
(P ¼ 0.0267) in viable cells when cultured in nutrient-rich
medium. Depletion of LAPTM4B resulted in a similar or more
pronounced decrease in viable cells when grown in low serum
or low glucose medium (P ¼ 0.001 and 0.0260, respectively; Fig.
5A) MDA468 breast cancer cells have inherently low normal
levels of LAPTM4B expression. MDA468 cells with forced
overexpression of LAPTM4B had similar cell viability to parental cells when cultured in nutrient-rich media (P ¼ 0.105).
These results suggest that a certain level of LAPTM4B may be
required for tumor cell survival, but its overexpression does not
directly promote in vitro cell growth under normal culture
conditions. However, the cells with overexpression of
LAPTM4B showed higher cell viability than control cells when
cultured in low serum or low glucose medium (P ¼ 0.0256 and
0.0960, respectively; Fig. 5B). As shown in Fig. 5C, the decreased
cell viability of BT549 cells after knockdown of LAPTM4B was
associated with increased activation of caspase-3 and PARP
cleavage. Similarly, the enhanced survival of MDA468 cells
overexpressing LAPTM4B in nutrient-deprived conditions was
associated with much lower levels of active caspase-3 and
PARP cleavage. These results support our hypothesis that high
expression of LAPTM4B potentiates the growth and survival of
breast cancer cells under metabolic stress.
Next, we tested whether modulation of LAPTM4B affects
survival of cells exposed to other types of stress. As shown in
Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B, expression levels of LAPTM4B

which autophagosomes are fused with lysosomes to form
autolysosomes.
Abortive accumulation of autophagosomes may act as a cell
death messenger to trigger caspase-dependent or -independent cell death. We found an increase in cell death as indicated
by caspase-3 activation and cleaved PARP in LAPTM4B-depleted cells with starvation-induced aggregation of autophagosomes (Fig. 4C). Although downregulation of LAPTM4B alone
may trigger LMP and to a lesser extent caspase activation, the
combination of LMP and blocked autophagy results in more
pronounced caspase activation and cell death.
In a complimentary experiment, stable overexpression of
LAPTM4B in MDA468 cells with inherently low levels of
LAPTM4B, resulted in greater starvation-induced autophagy
as indicated by higher levels of LC3II and lower levels of p62
(Fig. 4D; Supplementary Fig. S4C and S4D). This effect was
blocked by the autolysosome inhibitor chloroquine. These
results are consistent with the notion that overexpression of
LAPTM4B promotes increased autophagy ﬂux in cancer cells
exposed to metabolic stress.

had no effect on cell viability when cells were cultured in
acidiﬁed medium. Exposure to hypoxic stress showed variable
results. Forced overexpression of LAPTM4B in MDA468 cells
had no signiﬁcant effect on cell viability of cells grown in low
oxygen (Supplementary Fig. S5C). However, BT549 cells with
LAPTM4B depletion were more sensitive to hypoxia and had
reduced viability compared with parental BT549 cells that
overexpress LAPTM4B (Supplementary Fig. S5D).
We further examined the effects of LAPTM4B modulation on
tumor growth and survival in an in vivo xenograft model.

Discussion
The cancer gene LAPTM4B is one of two genes ampliﬁed and
overexpressed from chromosome 8q22 which predicts for de
novo anthracycline resistance and metastatic recurrence in
patients with breast cancer (36). Our previous work suggested
one mechanism by which LAPTM4B may promote chemotherapy resistance is by retention of anthracyclines in a cytoplasmic compartment thereby preventing nuclear drug
localization and drug-induced DNA damage. The frequent
occurrence of 8q ampliﬁcation and overexpression of
LAPTM4B in treatment-naive cancers raised the possibility

MDA468 cells with stable expression of either a control vector
or a vector driving LAPTM4B overexpression were inoculated
into the cleared mammary fat pad of nude mice. After 2
months, we found that the tumor xenografts that overexpressed LAPTM4B grew much faster than control xenografts
(t test, P ¼ 0.033; Fig. 6A). Examination of the xenograft tumor
explants showed that each continued to overexpress
LAPTM4B compared with control xenograft tumors (Fig.
6B); the presence of the smaller proteolytic fragments indicates
proper delivery of LAPTM4B to the lysosomes (37). We examined tumor lysates for markers of autophagy by immunoblot
(Fig. 6C). LAPTM4B-overexpressing xenografts showed higher
LC3II/LC3I ratio (P ¼ 0.0040; Fig. 6D), decreased p62 levels (P ¼
0.0363; Fig. 6E), and higher LC3II/LC3I/p62 ratio (P ¼
0.0074; Fig. 6F) consistent with increased autophagic ﬂux. This
result suggests that LAPTM4B overexpression promotes tumor
growth in vivo, perhaps by promoting greater tolerance to
stress through increased induction of autophagy.

that LAPTM4B may provide a growth or survival advantage to
tumor cells in the absence of a therapy challenge, resulting in
its selection and upregulation in primary (untreated) cancers.
In this study, we provide evidence that LAPTM4B is localized in
lysosomes of mammary cells and promotes lysosome membrane stability. Decreased expression of LAPTM4B leads to
increase in LMP, lysosomal pH, lysosomal release of cathepsins, and lysosome-mediated cell death. This effect is more
pronounced when cells are exposed to anthracycline chemotherapy but not when exposed to a taxane, consistent with the
increased sensitivity to anthracyclines in tumors with low
LAPTM4B expression (36). We ﬁnd that LAPTM4B plays a
critical role in autophagy and insufﬁcient levels of LAPTM4B
results in a failure of autophagosome–lysosome fusion causing
a block in autolysosome formation and decreased autophagy
ﬂux. In contrast, overexpression of LAPTM4B in breast cancer
cells that have normal DNA copy number of 8q22 and express
normal levels of LAPTM4B results in increased autophagy
ﬂux. These observations suggest that the proper function of
LAPTM4B is required for lysosome-mediated autophagy maturation. A recent study showed that transient overexpression
of LAPTM4B without coordinate increase of the expression of
its partner MCOLN1 in retinal epithelial cells led to increased
LC3II levels because of an accumulation of autophagosomes
(37). This ﬁnding could result from increased autophagy
induction or a block in autophagy ﬂux but is consistent with
the notion that appropriate levels of LAPTM4B are crucial to
proper lysosome-mediated autophagy.
Fusion of lysosome with autophagosome is a critical step for
autophagy maturation. Rab7, SKD1, Lamp2, UVRAG, and
Rebicon have been shown to be essential for this process

(5, 29, 30, 37, 45, 46). Frequent frameshift mutations have been
identiﬁed in the UVRAG gene in colon and gastric cancers (47);
however, no signiﬁcant aberrations in autophagy were found in
cancer cells carrying this mutation (48). To the best of our
knowledge, LAPTM4B represents the ﬁrst gene crucial for
autophagy maturation and ﬂux that is ampliﬁed in cancer
(36, 49) and is associated with treatment resistance and poor
clinical outcome in various cancers (34, 36, 39–41, 49). Metadherin was recently shown to induce autophagy in different cell
lineages by increasing expression of atg5 and activating AMP
kinase (50). Interestingly, the gene for metadherin, MTDH, is a
neighbor to LAPTM4B and is coampliﬁed with LAPTM4B in
cancers. We propose that the coordinate ampliﬁcation of the 2
genes may activate simultaneously the 2 major stages of the
autophagy pathway and thereby enhance tumor survival.
Tumors frequently experience elevated metabolic stress
from nutrient and oxygen deprivation due to insufﬁcient
angiogenesis (8). The high metabolic demands of cell proliferation and altered metabolism provide additional tumor cell
intrinsic stress. Thus, tumors may be more dependent on
survival mechanisms such as autophagy to maintain growth
or to disseminate (10, 51). We show that the roles of LAPTM4B
in limiting lysosome-mediated cell death and promoting
autophagy have signiﬁcant survival effects in cancer cells,
including greater resistance to nutrient deprivation, hypoxia,
and chemotherapy-induced genotoxic stress. We further show
that LAPTM4B prosurvival effect is associated with greater in
vivo tumor growth. The new knowledge from this study contributes to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of lysosome-mediated drug resistance and the particular
dependency of tumors on lysosomal function for cell survival.

As normal tissues are seldom under nutrient deﬁciency, there
may be a signiﬁcant therapeutic window for inhibiting
LAPTM4B in tumors that overexpress this gene and are
dependent on it for survival. Over-reliance of cancer cells on
LAPTM4B for tolerance to stress may represent the "Achilles
heel" for malignancies that have ampliﬁed this gene and
provide a new therapeutic strategy for targeting these cancers.
