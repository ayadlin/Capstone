ABSTRACT
Androgen receptor (AR) signaling is essential for the development of prostate
cancer. Here, we report that runt-related transcription factor (RUNX1) could be a
key molecule for the androgen-dependence of prostate cancer. We found RUNX1 is
a target of AR and regulated positively by androgen. Our RUNX1 ChIP-seq analysis
indicated that RUNX1 is recruited to AR binding sites by interacting with AR. In
androgen-dependent cancer, loss of RUNX1 impairs AR-dependent transcription and
cell growth. The RUNX1 promoter is bound by enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2)
and is negatively regulated by histone H3 lysine 27 (K27) trimethylation. Repression
of RUNX1 is important for the growth promotion ability of EZH2 in AR-independent
cells. In clinical prostate cancer samples, the RUNX1 expression level is negatively
associated with EZH2 and that RUNX1 loss correlated with poor prognosis. These
results indicated the significance of RUNX1 for androgen-dependency and that loss
of RUNX1 could be a key step for the progression of prostate cancer.

INTRODUCTION

treatment for prostate cancer and efficiently inhibits the
growth of androgen-dependent tumors. Unfortunately, the
majority of these cancers become refractory to hormone
deprivation therapy and emerges as castration-resistant.
Such castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a
significant clinical challenge, and investigation into the
biologic mechanisms that contribute to tumor regrowth
is of critical importance [1]. Mechanisms of castrationresistance can be grouped into two categories. The first
is enhancement of AR signaling caused by mutation,
amplification of the AR gene or other mechanisms that
allow for the activation of AR even with castration levels
of serum testosterone [1, 8-10]. The other group uses

Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed
cancer in men [1]. Androgen and its cognate receptor,
the androgen receptor (AR), are involved in prostate
oncogenesis through the transcriptional regulation of
target gene networks [2]. To determine the genomic
distribution of AR binding sites, it is important to consider
binding sites for AR collaborating transcription factors
such as FOXA1 [3, 4], NKX3-1 [5], GATA2, OCT1 [3]
and members of the ETS family of transcription factors
[6, 7].
Androgen-deprivation therapy is a standard

a mechanism to bypass AR signaling pathways [11],
which allows cancer cells to survive in the absence of
androgen-dependent or -independent AR activation. For
example, cells that lack AR expression or had repressed
AR signaling have been reported in large numbers of
metastatic tumors derived from prostate cancer patients
[12].
The runt-related transcription factor (RUNX) family
consists of transcription factors such as RUNX1, RUNX2,
and RUNX3. Each is capable of forming heterodimers with
the common core-binding factor (CBF) β subunit [13].
RUNX-CBFβ heterodimers bind to their consensus target
sequence, TGT/CGGT, and either activate or repress the
transcription of target genes. Interestingly, each RUNX
protein has differential function. RUNX1 is essential for
hematopoiesis [14], RUNX2 for osteogenesis [15] and
RUNX3 for neurogenesis [16]. In addition, RUNX genes
are associated with different types of malignancy, and they
function as both oncogenes and tumor suppressors in a
tissue-specific manner [13].
In the present study, we demonstrated the molecular
mechanism and clinical significance of RUNX1
expression in prostate cancer. By genome-wide analysis
of AR-binding sites (ARBSs), we identified RUNX1 as
an AR target gene that is induced by androgens. RUNX1
expression is necessary for AR signaling and androgendependent prostate cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore,
we showed that RUNX1 expression is correlated with a
good prognosis for prostate cancer patients. Enhancer of
zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), which is a major contributor to
androgen-independent signaling in prostate cancer [17],
represses RUNX1 transcription, and the expression of
RUNX1 is negatively associated with EZH2 in clinical
samples. We also observed that repression of RUNX1 by
EZH2 enhanced androgen-independent prostate cancer
cell growth. Taken together, our results showed that
RUNX1 plays a critical role in androgen-dependent and
–independent prostate cancer cell growth. Our findings
also highlighted the significance of RUNX1 loss in the
progression of prostate cancer.

analysis (Fig.1A). Two robust AR binding sites were
identified around the RUNX1 locus, one (ARBS #1)
is 50 kb downstream and the other (ARBS #2) is 200
kb upstream (Fig.1B, Supplementary Fig.1A) by AR
Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIPseq). In addition, RUNX1 upregulation by DHT treatment
was also observed and this induction was inhibited by
short interference RNA (siRNA) targeting AR-treatment
(Supplementary Fig.1B, C). We also confirmed RUNX1
induction by androgen in other AR positive prostate cancer
cells (Supplementary Fig.1D). Next, we investigated
histone modification patterns in the RUNX1 locus by
ChIP-seq (Fig.1B, Supplementary Fig.1E). RUNX1 has
two distinct transcriptional start sites (TSSs: Promoter 1
and 2), and we found that promoter 2 is occupied with
highly acetylated histone H3 by ChIP-seq analysis.
Although both ARBSs are modified with monomethylation
of histone H3K4, an active enhancer mark, we showed that
ARBS #1 has a highly androgen-dependent transcriptional
activity by luciferase assay (Fig.1C). Highly acetylated
histone modification was observed only in the promoter
2 of RUNX1 (and not in that of CLIC6) around the
ARBS#1, implicating that this region acts as an enhancer
for RUNX1 induction (Fig.1B). These results suggest that
RUNX1 is directly regulated by AR binding.
Next, we analyzed the role of RUNX1 in prostate
cancer cells and its association with AR. To examine
whether AR interacts with RUNX1, we transfected 293T
cells with expression vectors of Flag-tagged AR and Myctagged RUNX1 and its deletion mutants (Fig.1D, upper).
We then performed immunoprecipitation by anti-Myc
antibody and immunoblotted with anti-Flag antibody.
We observed ligand dependent interaction of AR with
RUNX1. When the N-terminal region of RUNX1 was
deleted, this interaction was diminished, suggesting the
N-terminal domain is responsible for AR interaction
(Fig.1D, lower). We also showed the interaction of
endogenous AR and RUNX1 in LNCaP cells (Fig.1E). Our
results indicate that androgen-regulated RUNX1 interacts
with AR that regulates gene transcription.

AR

We investigated the genome-wide binding of
RUNX1 in androgen-dependent transcriptional regulation
by ChIP-seq. LNCaP cells were treated with vehicle
or DHT for 24 h and then ChIP was performed using a
RUNX1 specific antibody. Enriched DNA was sequenced
using a next generation sequencer and sequenced tags
were mapped to the human genome (Fig.2A). We obtained
1125 significant RUNX1 binding sites in vehicle-treated
cells and 2040 in DHT-treated cells using MACS (ref. 21,
P-value < 1.0E-5, Fig.2B). We have previously reported

We previously reported the global analysis of
androgen signaling by mapping ARBSs and androgenregulated transcripts [18, 19, 20]. Using quantitative
reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis, we
found that RUNX1 is highly induced by R1881 10 nM
treatment in LNCaP cells (more than 50-fold following
48 h of treatment) (Fig.1A). RUNX1 protein levels
were also increased as demonstrated by western blot

significant DHT-dependent ARBSs (defined by MACS
P-value <1.0E-5) in a previous publication [20]. As we
expected, overlap of ARBSs with RUNX1 binding sites
was observed and we validated androgen-dependent
RUNX1 recruitment to representative ARBSs (Fig.2C-D,
Supplementary Fig.2A). In addition, analysis of global
RUNX1 ChIP-seq signals has revealed the distribution of
RUNX1 bindings around the peak centers of significant
ARBSs (Fig. 2E). The enriched motifs of transcription
factors in RUNX1 binding sites were analyzed using
HOMER [22]. Interestingly, the canonical RUNX1
binding motifs were not enriched (0.5% of all binding
sites) although FOXA1 and AR motifs were enriched
(Fig.2F), suggesting indirect binding of RUNX1 in ARBSs
by binding to AR .

promoter (histoneH3 K4me3, K27me3, and AcH3). We
found that the RUNX1 promoter is occupied with modified
histones not only the markers of activation, but also the
repressive marker, H3K27me3 (Fig.4A). In prostate
cancer cells, EZH2 overexpression is known to promote
cancer progression [17]. EZH2 is a part of the polycomb
complex that induces gene repression through histone
H3K27 methylation. We observed that knockdown of
EZH2 enhances the expression of RUNX1 (Fig.4B) and
represses H3K27 methylation in the RUNX1 promoter
(Fig.4C). By ChIP assay we further investigated whether
the RUNX1 promoter is associated with EZH2 or not.
SLIT2 is a representative target of EZH2 in prostate
cancer and its promoter is occupied with EZH2 [23]. In
LNCaP cells, we observed EZH2 recruitment, comparable
with that of the SLIT2 promoter, to the 5′-upstream region
and the promoter of RUNX1 (Fig.4D). By ChIP-seq,
we further analyzed the regions occupied by EZH2 and
identified multiple EZH2 binding sites in 5′-upstream
region of the RUNX1 gene (Fig.4E). Similar results were
also observed in VCaP and DU145 cells (Supplementary
Fig.4). These results suggest the regulation of RUNX1 by
EZH2 dependent H3K27 methylation.

Knockdown of RUNX1 inhibited AR binding and
androgen-mediated gene induction
We next analyzed the effect of RUNX1 on AR
binding by ChIP-seq. We treated LNCaP cells with short
interference RNA (siRNA) targeting RUNX1 or control
RNA (siControl) (Fig.3A). We performed AR ChIP
after treating cells with DHT. In our ChIP and ChIP-seq
study, the number of significant ARBSs obtained was
decreased and enrichments of AR binding are inhibited
by RUNX1 knockdown, suggesting a positive role of
RUNX1 for AR binding (Fig.3B, C). The overlap of
ARBSs with RUNX1 binding, and the reduction of
ARBSs by RUNX1 knockdown were also observed in
VCaP cells (Supplementary Fig.2B). These results indicate
a significant role for RUNX1 recruitment to ARBS in AR
binding.
Next, we examined the role of RUNX1 expression
in androgen-mediated gene induction. We treated LNCaP
cells with vehicle or DHT for 24 h after transfecting
siRUNX1 or siControl. Then microarray analysis was
performed to analyze the expression profile (Fig.3D).
There were 895 genes selected as androgen-inducible
(over 1.4-fold). Androgen-responsiveness of 620
genes (69%) was repressed by RUNX1 knockdown.
Furthermore, qRT-PCR and luciferase analysis also
showed that RUNX1 knockdown resulted in the inhibition
of androgen-mediated gene and AR transcriptional activity
in prostate cancer cells (Fig.3E, F, Supplementary Fig.3).
These results indicate the positive effect of endogenous
RUNX1 expression in androgen-mediated gene induction.

Knockdown of RUNX1 repressed androgendependent, but enhanced androgen-independent
prostate cancer cell proliferation
We explored the role of RUNX1 in prostate cancer
cell proliferation. In LNCaP cells, we observed that
androgen-dependent cell proliferation is inhibited by
siRUNX1 transfection (Fig.5A). This effect of RUNX1
knockdown was also confirmed in VCaP cells. Next, we
analyzed the role of RUNX1 in AR-negative prostate
cancer cells. In DU145 cells, which represent androgenindependent cell proliferation, RUNX1 is expressed
and effectively knocked down by siRUNX1 treatment
(Fig.5B). By cell counting assays, we showed that
proliferation of DU145 cells was promoted by RUNX1
knockdown in contrast to LNCaP cells, where proliferation
is repressed (Fig.5C, D). The negative effect of RUNX1
on proliferation is also confirmed by overexpression of
RUNX1 in DU145 cells (Fig.5E). We further analyzed
whether this growth inhibitory effect of RUNX1 in
androgen-independent cells was mediated by the function
of EZH2 or not. We showed that RUNX1 knockdown by
two different siRNAs promotes cell proliferation (Fig.5F).
Surprisingly, the siEZH2-mediated growth inhibition
was relieved by RUNX1 knockdown, suggesting EZH2
growth stimulatory effect is mediated partially at least by
RUNX1 repression (Fig.5G, H). These results suggested
that RUNX1 negatively regulates androgen-independent
signaling for cell proliferation despite a positive effect on
AR-mediated cell growth.

in prostate cancer tissues was associated with poor
cancer-specific survival of the patients (Fig.6B). In
contrast, we observed strong expression of EZH2 in the
nucleus of prostate cancer tissues, and weak expression

poor prognosis of the patients (Supplementary Fig.5).

DISCUSSION

Additionally, we investigated the expression of
RUNX1 and EZH2 in LTAD cells derived from LNCaP
cells and 22Rv1 cells that were used as cell models for
AR-positive CRPC. We observed EZH2 expression level
was repressed by androgen treatment and long-term
androgen depletion increased EZH2 expression (Fig.
6E, F). Conversely, RUNX1 expression is repressed by
long androgen-depletion (Fig. 6F). Thus, we revealed a
significant role of RUNX1 in androgen-dependent and
androgen-independent cancer growth and demonstrated
that RUNX1 loss could be a diagnostic tool for advanced
prostate cancer as modeled in Fig.6G.

In the present study, we first analyzed RUNX1
function in androgen-dependent prostate cancer growth
because we found that RUNX1 expression is induced
by androgen treatment. To analyze global transcriptional
function, we then extensively mapped RUNX1 binding
sites in the prostate cancer genome and identified RUNX1
is recruited to AR binding sites by direct interaction with
AR. Our microarray analysis demonstrated that androgenmediated gene induction is repressed by RUNX1
knockdown. Cell proliferation assays indicate the positive

androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell proliferation by activating AR. However, in advanced prostate cancer, RUNX1 is downregulated
epigenetically by EZH2. This repression would be correlated with another role of RUNX1 as a negative regulator of androgen-independent
cell growth.

role of RUNX1 in androgen-dependent prostate cancer
growth. Thus, the androgen-regulated RUNX1 positively
enhances the transcriptional activity of AR.
Investigation of the role of RUNX genes in
cancer started with the discovery of RUNX1 as an
important translocation breakpoint in leukemia [24], and
dysregulation of RUNX-mediated gene expression has
also been linked to the development and progression of
malignancy [13]. Interestingly, RUNX1 was found in both
normal and cancerous prostate cells [25]. The expression
level and functions of RUNX1 in aggressive prostate
cancer have not been fully investigated, although a single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the RUNX1 locus was
found to be associated with the survival of prostate cancer
patients, suggesting the significance of RUNX1 in prostate
cancer [26].
Importantly, low expression of RUNX1 is
associated with poor prognosis of the patients and high
Gleason score in our clinical prostate cancer samples.
This result raises the possibility that repression of
RUNX1 could lead to promotion of tumor growth in
advanced prostate cancer. Therefore, we analyzed the
role of RUNX1 in androgen-independent cells. In ARnegative hormone-refractory prostate cancer, DU145
cells, RUNX1 knockdown enhances cell proliferation.
These findings indicated that RUNX1 has dual roles in
prostate cancer as a positive regulator by promoting AR
binding and a negative regulator by modulating ARindependent signals. The poor outcome of prostate cancer
with low expression of RUNX1 could be in line with
this negative role of RUNX1 in prostate cancer growth.
The downstream signals of RUNX1 in AR-negative
prostate cancer cells require investigation to understand
the specific role of RUNX1 in growth inhibition in ARindependent prostate cancer. Meanwhile, analyses of the
RUNX1 transcriptional networks in previous studies have
documented the activation of tumor suppressors, such as
p19 [27] or p21 [28], or the inhibition of oncogenes by
RUNX1 binding [29] for cancer progression. Therefore,
AR-independent and RUNX1-regulated signals, which
remain to be clarified, may be important for prostate
cancer progression.
EZH2 plays a central role as a catalytic enzyme
involved in histone H3 Lys 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3)
which silences transcription [17]. The expression of EZH2
is correlated with CRPC progression [17, 30]. Tumor
suppressors such as DAB2IP have been reported as
EZH2 or PRC2 targets [31]. A recent report suggested an
H3K27me3-independent mechanism of EZH2 by working
as a co-activator of AR for gene activation in CRPC model
cells [30]. Moreover, EZH2 is important in maintaining
the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells or prostate
cancer stem cells [32-34]. By investigating the histone
modification of genes in prostate cancer, we found that
the RUNX1 promoter is occupied with H3K27me3 and
that EZH2 is bound to the region. Clinical and cell-based
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

experimental results indicate that RUNX1 and EZH2
are negatively correlated. Thus, we consider RUNX1
as a target of EZH2 in prostate cancer. Furthermore,
the result of our cell proliferation assay indicates that
RUNX1 repression is critical for the role of EZH2 for
cell proliferation. Interestingly, we observed that EZH2
is androgen-repressed in LNCaP cells and upregulated in
CRPC model cells such as LTAD and 22Rv1 cells. This
result is in line with the past report in which EZH2 was
found to be overexpressed in another CRPC cell line, abl
cells [30]. We demonstrated that RUNX1 expression is
downregulated in such cell lines. This RUNX1 repression
may also be mediated by androgen-depletion because
RUNX1 is a direct target of AR as shown in the present
study. We expect that the transition of RUNX1 expression
levels may be useful for a diagnostic marker for CRPC.
We unexpectedly identified a dual role for RUNX1
in prostate cancer progression. 1) To support AR activity
and androgen-dependent cell growth, RUNX1 expression
is required in AR-positive cells. 2) RUNX1 could exhibit
EZH2-mediated tumor suppressive effects in prostate
cancer development and progression, as suggested
by clinical data. In AR-negative cell lines, RUNX1
knockdown enhances, while RUNX1 overexpression
inhibits, the growth of prostate cancer cells. Our results
indicated that RUNX1-mediated gene regulation, which is
AR-independent, inhibits the cell growth. Based on these
results, we speculate that RUNX1 may be essential for the
survival of prostate cancer cells as AR is the key signal
factor in clinical prostate cancer progression. In contrast,
a reduction in RUNX1 expression, not overexpression,
is required to prevent AR-independent growth inhibitory
effect on prostate cancer cells. Further characterization of
RUNX1-transcriptional networks and clinical analyses in
context-specific conditions would reveal further details of
prostate cancer progression.
In summary, this is the first report that both AR and
EZH2 regulate RUNX1 and that RUNX1 was shown to
have differential functions in androgen-dependent and
androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. In addition,
our clinical study indicated that low expression levels
of RUNX1 would be an indicator of poor prognosis of
prostate cancer patients. These findings suggest that the
transition of RUNX1 expression could be a critical step
for the progression of prostate cancer.

METHODS
Cell culture and reagents
Prostate cancer cell lines were purchased from
ATCC (Manassas, VA). VCaP cells were grown in
Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with
10% FBS. LNCaP, DU145, and 22Rv1 cells were grown
2272

Oncotarget

in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 U/mL
penicillin, and 50 µg/mL streptomycin. LTAD cells were
grown in phenol-red–free RPMI medium supplemented
with 10% charcoal-stripped FBS [19]. For androgen
treatment, we treated cells with 1 or 10 nM R1881 or
10 nM dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The antibodies used
in this study were RUNX1 (Upstate, Billerica MA),
RUNX1 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK; ab23980), EZH2 (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA; 612666), H3K27me3 (Abcam,
ab6002). Other antibodies and reagents used have been
previously described [18, 19].

Omnibus (GSE62492). Sequence data Libraries were
prepared according to Illumina’s instructions. Unfiltered
36-bp sequence reads were aligned against the human
reference genome (hg19 or hg18) using CASAVA v1.7
(Illumina). Signal scores of RUNX1 and EZH2 bindings
were calculated using model-based analysis of ChIP-seq
(MACS, ref. 21) and the threshold of binding sites was
the P-value of < 1.0 E-5. Overlapping regions of RUNX1
and AR binding sites were determined by comparing the
regions occupied by AR with those occupied by RUNX1.
The regions shared by both peaks were designated as
binding sites with overlapping AR and RUNX1. The other
regions were classified as unique factor-specific binding
sites, as shown in Fig. 2C.
Integrative genomic browser was used for
visualization as described [19]. Motif analysis of
binding sequences was performed using HOMER
[22]. Primers are as follows: RUNX1 promoter 1
(forward: GCTGTGGGTTGGTGATGCT, reverse:
GGACGAATCACACTGAATGCA), RUNX1 promoter
2
(forward:
GCCAGCGAAGAGTTTCCTAGTC,
reverse: GCGTGGCTGCTTTCAACTTT), RUNX1
5′-upstream (forward: GACGCTTGCTACAGACGTGA,
reverse: CCACTGCAGGGGTAGTGATT), ARBS
#1 (forward: TGATCAGATGCCCTGGAAATATAG,
reverse: GCCGATGTCCAGTGTAAGCA), and ARBS
#2 (forward: CTGGAACTTCTGTCCCCATC, reverse:
TTTGCTGGTGATGGCAAATA).

Small interfering RNA (siRNA)
For siRNA experiments, we purchased
siRNAs targeting EZH2 (#1: HSS176652, #2:
HSS176653) and a negative control siRNA from
Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA). The sequences
of siRNA targeting RUNX1 are siRUNX1 #1:
5′-CCGCAGAACCAGAACGUUUUC-3′, and siRUNX1
#2: 5′-CCUGCGUUGGACCUUCCUUUU-3′ and we
purchased them from Sigma Genosys (Spring, TX). Cells
were transfected with RNA using an RNA interference
(RNAi) reagent, Lipofectamine® RNAiMAX Reagent,
(Life Technologies) 48–72 h before each experiment.

Plasmid Construction

Cell proliferation assay

For construction of Myc-tagged RUNX1, the
RUNX1 coding sequence (NM_001001890.2) was
amplified by PCR and inserted into the EcoRI and XhoI
sites of pcDNA3.0 including the Myc tag sequence at
N-terminal end. For construction of the ARBS-luciferase
vectors, the genomic regions (chr. 21: 35031129-35031554
(ARBS #1), and 35617483-35619831 (ARBS #2)) were
amplified by PCR. Cloned ARBSs were inserted to the
MluI and XhoI sites of the pGL3-promoter vector. PSALUC and TACC2-LUC have been described before [19].

Cells were plated at 3 × 103 cells per well in
96-well plates. For RNAi experiments, cells were
transfected with siRNA 24 h after cell plating.
The
MTS
[3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2Htetrazolium, inner salt] assay was performed using
the CellTiter 96® Aqueous MTS reagent (Promega,
Madison WI), according to the protocol provided by the
manufacturer. The experiment was performed five times.
For cell counting, cells were trypsinized and counted using
the trypan blue exclusion method to quantify cell viability.

ChIP and ChIP-seq
ChIP and qPCR were performed as previously
described [18, 19]. The fold enrichment relative to the
IgG-IP control or input was quantified by quantitative
PCR (qPCR) using SYBR Green PCR master mix
and the ABI StepOne system (Life Technologies). The
primer sequences for the detection of ARBSs by qPCR
are listed below or described in previous studies [18, 19].
We performed AR, AcH3, K4me1, K4me3, RUNX1,
H3K27me3 and EZH2 ChIP-seq in LNCaP cells using
an Illumina Genome Analyzer or hiseq (Illumina, San
Diego, CA) as described [20]. We also performed AR
and RUNX1 ChIP-seq in VCaP cells. These sequence
results have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation
For immunoprecipitation, 1 mg of cell lysate protein
was incubated with anti-AR and anti-Myc antibody or
normal rabbit IgG at 4°C overnight. The mixture of cell
extract and antibody was then incubated with protein
G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway,
NJ) at 4°C for 2 h, and washed 4 times with NP-40 lysis
buffer. The immunoprecipitated proteins were boiled for
5 min in Laemmli sample buffer and separated by SDSPAGE. Immunoblotting was performed as described [19].

Quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRTPCR)

Prostate cancer cohort and immunohistochemistry
(IHC)

Total RNA was isolated using ISOGEN reagent.
First strand cDNA was generated using the PrimeScript
RT reagent kit (Takara, Kyoto, Japan). Expression
levels were quantified by qPCR as previously described
[19]. The primer sequences for RUNX1 are as follows:
forward:
ACTTCCTCTGCTCCGTGCT,
reverse:
GCGGTAGCATTTCTCAGCTC.

We obtained prostate cancer samples (N = 103)
from surgeries performed at the University of Tokyo
Hospital (Tokyo, Japan). The Tokyo University ethics
committee approved this study, and informed consent
was obtained from each patient before surgery. The
ages of the patients ranged from 52 to 78 years (mean,
67 years), and pretreatment serum prostate-specific
antigen (PSA) levels ranged from 1.2 to 136 ng/
mL (mean, 16.7 ng/mL). Other clinicopathological
parameters are shown in Supplementary Table 1.
Formalin-fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin and
sectioned. A Histofine Kit (Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan),
which employs the streptavidin-biotin amplification
method, was used and the antigen-antibody complex
was visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine solution (1
mM 3,3′-diaminobenzidine, 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer [pH
7.6], and 0.006% H2O2). In an immunohistochemical
analysis, the immunoreactivity was evaluated in more
than 1000 carcinoma cells for each case. The percentage
of immunoreactivity (LI: labeling index) was determined
by trained pathologists [19]. Cases of LI > 10 were
considered positive.

Statistical analysis
For the cell proliferation assay, we analyzed 4
wells. For cell line experiments, statistical differences
(P-values) among groups were obtained using a twosided Student’s t-test. All experiments were performed
at least twice and similar results were obtained. P-values
less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad
Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA)
or MS Excel. The association between immunoreactivity
and clinicopathological factors was evaluated using the
Student’s t-test, a cross-table with the chi square-test, or
the correlation coefficient (r) and regression equation.
The cancer-specific survival curves were generated
according to the Kaplan-Meier method, and the statistical
significance was calculated using the log-rank test.
