ABSTRACT
Smoking is a major risk factor for developing pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC);
however, little is known about the mechanisms involved.
Here we employed a genetic animal model of early stages of PDAC that
overexpresses oncogenic Kras in the pancreas to investigate the mechanisms of
smoking-induced promotion of the disease in vivo. We confirmed the regulation of the
interactions between the tumor microenvironment cells using in vitro cellular systems.
Aerial exposure to cigarette smoke stimulated development of pancreatic
intraepithelial neaoplasia (PanIN) lesions associated with a tumor microenvironmentcontaining features of human PDAC including fibrosis, activated stellate cells, M2macrophages and markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The pro-cancer
effects of smoking were prevented by Histone Deacetylase HDAC I/II inhibitor Saha.
Smoking decreased histone acetylation associated with recruitment of and
phenotypic changes in macrophages; which in turn, stimulated survival and induction
of EMT of the pre-cancer and cancer cells. The interaction between the cancer cells
and macrophages is mediated by IL-6 produced under the regulation of HDAC3
translocation to the nucleus in the cancer cells. Pharmacological and molecular
inhibitions of HDAC3 decreased IL-6 levels in cancer cells. IL-6 stimulated the
macrophage phenotype change through regulation of the IL-4 receptor level of the
macrophage.
This study demonstrates a novel pathway of interaction between cancer cells and
tumor promoting macrophages involving HDAC3 and IL-6. It further demonstrates
that targeting HDAC3 prevents progression of the disease and could provide a strategy
for treating the disease considering that the HDAC inhibitor we used is FDA approved
for a different disease.

INTRODUCTION

data show a role of IL-6 secreted by the cancer cells on
inducing the M2 macrophage phenotype.
Multiple human case-control studies have linked
high serum levels of IL-6 with pancreatic cancer and
suggested using it as a marker of cancer progression. A
strong positive correlation was found among tumor stage,
cachexia and decreased survival [15-20].
In the present study we developed two mouse models
of pancreatic cancer precursors where Pdx1-Cre;LSLKras (KC) mice were exposed to cigarette smoke in
smoke chambers. Exposure to cigarette smoke stimulated
pancreatic neoplasia (PanIN in KC mice) formation
associated with a tumor microenvironment containing
features of human PDAC including fibrosis, activated
stellate cells, M2 macrophages along with markers of
epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer
stemness. We found that HDAC3 plays a major role in
mediating these smoking pro-cancer effects and that
inhibition of HDAC3 prevents these effects. Our work goes
on to demonstrate that HDAC3 specifically regulates IL-6
production in cancer cells in the tumor microenvironment;
and that IL-6 is involved in regulating macrophage function
including the promotion of the M2 phenotype.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the
fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths among both
men and women in the United States and remains without
effective therapies [1, 2]. Environmental risk factors such
as smoking, diabetes, obesity and alcoholism play major
roles in the promotion of PDAC [3-5]. However, we have
little understanding of how these risk factors promote
the disease. Animal models expressing genetic changes
observed in pancreatic cancer have been developed and
have greatly improved our understanding of the disease.
However, models incorporating these risk factors have
been lacking. Because cigarette smoking is an established
and major risk factor for PDAC [6, 7], models designed
to determine the mechanisms of smoking-induced PDAC
can provide important insights into the promotion of this
cancer.
HDAC enzymes are critical regulators of
fundamental cellular events such as cell cycle,
differentiation, and apoptosis [8]. HDAC1 has been shown
to be involved in regulating epithelial to mesenchymal
transition (EMT) in pancreatic cancer cells by directly
interacting and stabilizing the pro-EMT Zeb1 transcription
factor [9]. EMT is considered a critical process of cell
transformation in cancer metastasis. In addition to PDAC,
risk factors such as smoking and alcohol abuse cause
inflammatory diseases of the pancreas such as acute and
chronic pancreatitis. Previous reports indicate a key role
for pancreatic inflammation in the promotion of PDAC
in both humans and animal models. In addition, there is
increasing evidence that sub-types of macrophages play
a major role in promotion of many cancers including
pancreatic cancer [10, 11]. There is a strong correlation
between M2 type macrophages and increased metastasis
and poor prognosis in humans with PDAC [12].
Little is known about the intracellular mechanisms
involved in secretion of cytokines from early cancer
lesions such as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia
(PanIN) and cystic papillary neoplasia (CPN similar
to human IPMN and MCN) and cancer cells that are in
communication with cells in the tumor microenvironment.
Data presented here provide evidence for a role of HDAC
in regulating cytokine secretion involved in promotion of
the pro-tumor type-2 macrophage (M2) phenotype and
tumor promotion. That is, inhibition of HDAC specifically
inhibited interleukin 6 (IL-6) production by cancer
cells that we found was necessary for the macrophage
phenotype change in our animal model of PDAC. These
results point to roles for HDAC and IL-6 in regulation of
macrophages by neoplastic lesions and cancer cells.
It has been shown that IL-6 is able to induce
interleukin-4 (IL-4) production in T cells, thereby
polarizing these cells into Th2 cells [13, 14]. Very little
is known about the effect of IL-6 on macrophages. Our

RESULTS
Cigarette smoke stimulates PanIN lesions
formation in KC mice and HDAC inhibition
reverses this effect
We exposed KC mice to cigarette smoke for 7
weeks and treated mice with the HDAC inhibitor Saha.
The KC mice carry the Kras mutation in the pancreas
and spontaneously develop PanIN lesions, considered to
be precursors of PDAC [21] Kras mutations are present
in 90% of pancreatic cancer patients [22, 23]. KC mice
recapitulate the characteristics of the human disease
including a vast desmoplastic reaction with rapid growth,
and represent the early stage of the disease [21]. KC mice
were exposed to cigarette smoke for 7 weeks and injected
with Saha or saline during the last 5 weeks of the treatment
(Fig 1A). During the 7 weeks of smoking exposure, levels
of carbon monoxide and gravimetric total smoke particles
(TSP) were measured every day and the levels of nicotine
measured every week (Table 1). TSP was increased during
the first week gradually to reach 80mg/m3.
Analysis of the pancreatic tissue from KC mice
exposed to cigarette smoke showed a marked increase
in the number and tissue area occupied by PanIN lesions
compared to control treated mice. The tissue area
containing PanINs was increased by over 300% and the
number of lesions was increased by ~70% (Fig 1B-1D).
More importantly, this increase was abolished when mice
were exposed to HDAC inhibitor Saha. The number and
tissue area covered by PanINs was decreased to a level

less than in control mice suggesting that HDAC not only
mediated the smoking effect but also contributed in the
basal progression of the disease (Fig 1C, 1D).
Other characteristics of pancreatic cancer such
as fibrosis and stellate cells activation were stimulated
by cigarette smoke, and prevented by Saha (Fig
2A, 2B). Collagen staining showed an increase of
35% and α-SMA by 2.5 times. Saha reversed these
effects decreasing collagen and α-SMA level by 70%
(Fig 2A, 2B).
Furthermore, dual staining of macrophages by
the general marker F4/80 and M2 macrophage marker
Arginase1 showed a 30% increase in the M2 macrophages
in the pancreas of mice exposed to cigarette smoke (Fig
2E). The increase in the number of M2 macrophages
was nearly abolished by Saha and was decreased by
almost 90% (Fig 2F). In addition, we found that smoking
stimulated EMT in mice pancreas as shown by E-cadherin
staining of the pancreatic tissue. This effect was inhibited
with Saha (Fig 2G).

In sum, the results above indicate that exposure
to cigarette smoke stimulates PanIN lesion formation,
fibrosis and inflammation, especially the presence of
M2 macrophages, and EMT. More importantly, the
administration of Saha to inhibit HDAC prevented these
pro-cancer effects of smoking.

Interaction between PanIN/cancer cells and M2
macrophages mediates promotion of pancreatic
cancer
Strong evidence shows a pro-cancer role of M2
macrophages in tumor development and worse outcome
in pancreatic cancer patients [24]. Therefore, we
established studies to analyze the potential interactions
between macrophages and pancreatic cancer cells.
We found that the pancreatic cancer cell line MIA
PaCa-2 conditioned media increased the survival of
macrophages (Fig 3A) and more importantly stimulated
a phenotype change of the macrophages towards the

p-HDAC3 and IL-6 mediate the interaction
between cancer cells and macrophages

M2 phenotype as measured by its markers CD163 and
Arginase1 (Fig 3B). Next, we cultured pancreatic cancer
cell lines in the presence of macrophage conditioned
media and found that M2 macrophage conditioned media
promoted survival of both MIA PaCa-2 and Bx-PC3 cells
compared to the M1 macrophage conditioned media (Fig
3C). In addition, M2 macrophage conditioned media
stimulated EMT in pancreatic cancer cells as shown by
measuring the level of the EMT markers N-cadherin and
vimentin (Fig 3D). Of note, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and
vimentin measurements we used in the previous figures
are established markers of EMT [25].

The results in Fig 3 led us to investigate the
composition of the cancer cell conditioned media to
determine what mediates the change in macrophage
phenotype induced by the cancer cells.
Therefore, we analyzed the growth factors and
cytokines secreted by cancer cells in the presence and
absence of HDAC inhibition using multiplex analysis. We
found that Saha did not affect production of any of the
analytes except the cytokine IL-6, suggesting that IL-6

mediates the regulation of the macrophage phenotype by
cancer cells (Fig 4).
To determine which member of the HDAC
families I and II (inhibited by saha) is involved in
regulating IL-6 production we analyzed the protein
level and localization of members of both families. We
found that HDAC3 phosphorylation level as well as the
level of p-HDAC3 in nuclear extracts were significantly
increased by both NNK and Cigarette Smoke
Condensate (CSC) smoking compounds (Fig 5A). The
level of total HDAC3 in total lysates did not change (Fig
5A) indicating that smoking compounds affect only the
phosphorylation status and the translocation of HDAC3
to the nucleus but not its protein level.
Next, we measured the effect of smoking
compounds on secretion of IL-6 by the cancer cells.
We found that NNK increased the level of IL-6 in
MIA PaCa-2 conditioned media by up to 3 folds
(Fig 5B). This effect was abolished when applying a
pharmacological or molecular inhibition of HDAC3
(Fig 5B).

To confirm the regulation of macrophage phenotype
by IL-6 we added IL-6 to the macrophages and found
that IL-6 increased the M2 phenotype as measured by
the level of two M2 macrophages markers Arginase1
and CD163 consistent with the in vitro and in vivo results
described above (Fig 6A). One mechanism through
which IL-6 may mediate macrophage phenotypic
change is through up-regulation of the IL-4 receptor
level [26]. Results in Fig 6B show that exposure of
human macrophages, pre-incubated for 24h with IL-4, to
recombinant IL-6, indeed, increases the number of cells
expressing IL-4 receptor from 62% to 91% of the total
population of macrophages (Fig 6B).

p-HDAC3, IL-6, M2 macrophages, and IL-4
receptor were highly expressed and histone
acetylation decreased in human pancreatic
tumors
To verify the validity of our animal and in vitro
data in humans we measured the protein level of histone

acetylation in human pancreatic cancer tissue samples
and their matching pancreatic normal-appearing tissues
from the same patients. We found that histone acetylation
was decreased in all cancer tissues compared to their
matching normal tissues (Fig 7A). Similarly, protein level
of p-HDAC3 was increased in 4 out of 5 human cancer
tissue samples compared to their matching normal-looking
tissues (Fig 7A). Furthermore, staining of pancreatic
tissue samples from cancer and normal patients showed
increase in the level of IL-6 cytokine, M2 macrophages,
and IL-4 receptor levels on macrophages as measured
by immunostaining (Fig 7B). Of note, IL-6 staining was
observed in many cell types in the cancer tissue including
cancer cells and stellate cells compared to almost no
staining in normal tissue. The role of stellate cells in
the micro-environment cell interactions is investigated
in a separate study. Quantification of the number of M2
macrophages shows a significant 2.5-times increase in
cancer tissue compared to normal tissue (Fig 7C). The
number of M2 macrophages (dual positive for CD68 and
Arginase1) was increased by 15 times in cancer tissue
(30% of total macrophages) compared to normal tissue
(2% of total macrophages) (Fig 7C). Furthermore, the
level of IL-4 receptor staining in M2 macrophages was

increased from 30% of M2 macrophages in normal tissues
to 81% in cancer tissues (Fig 7B). All these data in human
tissue samples confirm our findings in mice.

DISCUSSION
In this study we have developed a model of early
PDAC induced by smoking, a major risk factor for the
disease. We used genetically altered animals for this model
using the Pdx1-Cre;LSL-Kras mice which spontaneously
develop PanIN lesions [21], the precursors of PDAC.
Here we provide information in these genetically altered
animals that exposure to cigarette smoke promotes these
precancerous lesions through a mechanism that involves
HDAC, especially p-HDAC3.
First, cigarette smoke induced a significant
stimulation in the amount and the size of pancreatic
lesions. Associated with neoplasia development were
several other features of human PDAC including a tumor
microenvironment consisting of fibrosis, activated stellate
cells, and M2 macrophages along with markers of EMT.
Cigarette smoke exposure induced a significant 8-fold
increase in pancreatic lesions. Cigarette smoking induced

an increase of 30% in fibrosis. In KC mice, the increase
in collagen deposition was associated with an increase
in stellate cells activation. Stellate cells are considered
responsible for the large amount of collagen production in
the tumor micro-environment [27-29].
Further analysis focused on the presence of the
macrophages, especially M2 macrophages showed a 30%
increase in their number in the KC mice exposed to cigarette
smoke compared to KC mice exposed to filtered air.
We observed a general tendency of an increase
in the level of M2 macrophages in mice exposed to
cigarette smoke compared to control treated mice. The
effect of smoking on macrophages confirms the recently
published findings in a mice model of pancreatic
cancer [30].

A very important finding of the study is that smoking
can mediate EMT at the stage of pancreatic lesions, long
before reaching the adenocarcinoma stage. Markers of
EMT such as a decrease in E-cadherin and increase in
vimentin were stimulated by cigarette smoke. This is
crucial finding knowing the association between EMT and
metastasis and cancer stemness [31, 32].
The role of HDAC and macrophages in promoting
pancreatic cancer development was investigated in our
study. We found that smoking decreased histone acetylation
in a similar fashion. Further, we found that inhibition of
HDAC prevents neoplastic lesion formation, fibrosis, and
M2 macrophage in the KC mice exposed to cigarette smoke.
Our in vitro data showed that among the HDAC
family HDAC3 mediates a critical interaction between

cancer cells and macrophages leading to stimulation
of the macrophage phenotype change towards the procancer M2 phenotype. This effect is mediated by the IL-6
cytokine. We found that smoking compounds stimulate
activation/phosphorylation and translocation of HDAC3
to the nucleus, and that pharmacological and molecular
inhibitions of HDAC3 decrease the level of IL-6 produced
by the cancer cells. IL-6 mediated, at least in part, the
phenotypic change in macrophages through regulation of
IL-4 receptor expression leading to more interaction with
IL-4 in the micro-environment. The HDAC3 regulation
of IL-6 in the pancreatic cancer cells and its effect on
regulating the macrophage phenotype is a novel finding.
The pro-tumor M2 macrophages in turn, slightly, but
significantly, stimulated survival of the pancreatic cancer
cells. More importantly, we found that M2 macrophage
conditioned media stimulated expression of EMT markers
in pancreatic cancer cells. This effect could be mediated
by TGF-β and IL-10 [11, 33].
EMT is an important mediator of early metastasis
and resistance to treatments indicating development of
these features of cancer aggressiveness in early stages of
the disease [31, 32, 34].
The analysis of human pancreatic tissue samples
confirmed our findings in animals and cells. The pancreatic
cancer tissue samples were compared to their matching
tissue samples isolated from the normal looking pancreatic
tissue areas from the same patient. Human pancreatic cancer
tissues expressed lower levels of histone acetylation, higher
level of p-HDAC3 and M2 macrophage marker Arginase1,
and higher levels of IL-6 and IL-4 receptor compared
to normal tissue. This is the first data showing such
associations in the human pancreatic cancer tissue samples.

Recently published data showed that inhibition
of IL-6 prevents promotion of pancreatic cancer in
mice [35]. Our data show the mechanism of regulation
of IL-6 production in the context of pancreatic cancer
development through a pathway that involves HDAC3
activation.
Preventing EMT is of critical importance in the
fight against pancreatic cancer. In fact, chemotherapeutic
agents are very successful in killing and preventing
proliferation of the cancer cells; yet, EMT-mediated
metastasis and cancer stemness induce a rapid spreading
of the disease in the body as well as a rapid development
of resistance to treatments. Therefore, our findings
open a possibility to target these key components of the
pathway mediating cancer cell evasion from treatments.
This study shows a critical role of IL-6 in mediating
the interaction between cancer cells and macrophages.
However, we cannot exclude that IL-6 is also produced
by macrophages and pancreatic stellate cells and
may regulate other interactions, especially involving
pancreatic stellate cells [36].
In summary, we have developed an animal model
of pancreatic cancer precursors induced by a combination
of a genetic mutation and exposure to cigarette smoke.
An important finding of the study is the role of HDAC
in promoting pancreatic cancer through a mechanism that
involves stimulation of the interaction between pre-cancer
or cancer cells and macrophages. This mechanism is
mediated by HDAC3 and IL-6 (Fig 8). More importantly,
we found that inhibition of HDAC by the FDA approved
inhibitor Saha reversed the effect of smoking and
decreased the level of PanIN lesions along with inhibition
of development of the tumor microenvironment. These

promotion through regulation of histone acetylation. They
also demonstrate a novel mechanism of regulation of the
macrophages phenotype leading to a phenotype change
in the cancer cells towards the mesenchymal phenotype
prone of metastasis and resistance to treatments.

by the red laser, and levels were quantified using the green
laser. Digital images of the bead array were captured after
laser excitation and processed on a computer workstation.
Standard curves and reports of unknown samples were
prepared using BeadView and MiraiBio software.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Reagents
NNK was purchased from ChemSyn Science
Laboratories (Lenexa, KS, USA). Cigarette smoke
condensate (CSC) from Murty Pharmaceuticals Inc
(Lexington, KY). Alpha-smooth muscle actin (αSMA)
antibody was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO); CD45 antibody from Thermo-Scientific (Rockford,
IL); Sirius Red/Collagen Staining Kit was from Chondrex
(Redmond, WA); F4/80 and vimentin antibodies from
AbCam (Cambrige, MA); Arginase1 from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); IL-6 antibody from
Novus Biological (Littleton, CO); IL-4 receptor-α antibody
from Biolegend (San Diego, CA); other antibodies
were from Cell signaling (Danvers, MA). IL-4 and IL-6
recombinant peptides were from Bio Vision (Milpitas,
CA). M-CSF was from Prospec (East Brunswick, NJ).
Saha was from Cayman (Ann Arbor, MI). All other
chemicals were from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).

Human pancreatic tissue samples
Human pancreatic tissue samples were received
from Dr. Nissen, the Director of Hepatobiliary and
Pancreatic Surgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. The
study is approved by Cedars-Sinai under the IRB protocols
# 4201and # 34086. Informed consents were obtained
from all subjects before collecting tissue specimens.

Macrophage preparation
For Bone Marrow Derived Macrophage (BMDM)
preparation, in brief, both ends of femur and tibia were
cut and flushed with a syringe filled with complete
RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (cRPMI)
to extrude BM cells into a sterile petri dish. After gentle
re-suspension and centrifugation, BM cells were cultured
using 20% L929 cell conditioned medium (as a source
of granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor)
in cRPMI. On day 4, unattached cells were discarded,
and medium was replaced with a fresh batch containing
the L929 cell conditioned medium as above. Cells were
ready for use on day 6 [40]. For human macrophage
preparation, in brief, human peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMCs) were isolated from buffy coats by FicollHypaque density gradient centrifugation, and then
monocytes were further enriched by CD14+ magnetic
beads (Miltenyi Biotec). Enriched monocytes were
cultured with complete RPMI medium containing 50-100
ng/ml hM-CSF for 6 days. At day 7, human macrophages
were ready for use [41].

Mouse model
Mice were generated by Dr. Paul Grippo [21, 37].
Mice were housed in a temperature of (20 -/+2°C) room
with a 12 hour light-dark cycle.
The Pdx1-Cre;LSL-Kras mice (8 mice per group)
were exposed to cigarette smoke for 6 hours per day, 5
days per week for duration of 7 weeks. We used humidified
3R4F cigarettes (Tobacco Health Research Institute,
Lexington, KY). During the first week, the concentration
of nicotine in the smoke was raised every day from
30mg/m3 to reach 80mg/m3 by the end of the week to
allow adaptation of the mice to the treatment. During the
remaining 6 weeks mice were exposed to cigarette smoke
for an average level of 80mg/m3. The concentration of
nitric oxide and carbon monoxide in cigarette smoke in
the chambers was monitored daily. The level of nicotine
was measured weekly during the remaining 6 weeks of
the treatment.
During the last 5 weeks of the exposure mice were
intra-peritoneally (i.p.) injected with Saha (50mg/Kg) or
saline 5 days per week [38].
After 7 weeks, mice were sacrificed 24 hours after
the last exposure to cigarette smoke, pancreas collected
and preserved adequately for analysis.
All of the mice were housed in Association
for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal

Immunohistochemistry
Samples of pancreas were fixed in formalin and
paraffin embedded. Paraffin-embedded sections of
pancreas were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to
determine the presence of pancreatic lesions and for
standard histological examination. Fibrosis was evaluated
by immunostaining with Sirius Red/Collagen antibody

Inflammatory cells in the pancreas were evaluated
by immunostaining with anti-CD45 antibody. Cell
proliferation was evaluated by PCNA staining.

Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) and 1% of antibiotic/antimicotic solution (Omega
Scientific, Tarzana, CA). Cells were maintained at 37°C
in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and were
used between passages 2 and 10.
Transient transfections of MIA PaCa cells were
performed using the electroporation Amaxa System
Nucleofector™ (Amaxa Inc, Gaithersburg, MD) according
to the manufacturer protocol. HDAC3 siRNA, (MWG
biotech, High Point, NC) was applied to the cells using
electroporation according to the Amaxa kit protocol.
Control cells were transfected with the Silencer Negative
Control siRNA #1 (Ambion; Foster City, CA).

Immunofluorescence analysis
Immunofluorescence analysis of the pancreas after
smoke exposure was performed on 5-μm-thick tissue
sections mounted onto glass slides that were baked
overnight at 58°C. Tissues were deparaffinized with
xylene, rehydrated in decreasing concentrations of ethanol
and permeabilized for 30 min with methanol solution.
Antigen retrieval was performed by boiling sections in
0.5% citrate buffer for 15 min, blocked with 2.5% horse
serum for 1 h and incubated with murine F4/80 and
Arginase1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA)
primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. Slides were washed
with PBS and incubated with FITC-conjugated (A-629511,
Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) and Alexa-Fluor-647
(A-21447, Invitrogen)-conjugated secondary antibodies
for 1 h, washed three times and mounted with Vectashield
containing 4ʹ 6ʹ-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).

Flow cytometry
For surface staining, cells were stained with
APC-conjugated IL-4 receptor-α (Biolegend). Cells
were washed, stained with surface markers. Dead cells
were excluded from analysis using violet viability stain
(Invitrogen). Cells were acquired on a Cyan (Beckman
Coulter, Brea, CA) and analyzed with Summit v4.3.

Statistics

Western blot

Statistical analyses of the immunohistochemical
quantifications and biochemical measurements were
performed by using Student’s t test, one-way ANOVA,
or Fisher’s exact test with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad
Software). A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant. The data showed is the result of at least 3
different experiments.

Tissue was homogenized and re-suspended in RIPA
phosphorylation buffer (50 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris/HCl
pH 7.2, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1%
SDS, 10 mM Na2HPO4 + NaH2PO4, 100 mM NaF, 2 mM
Na3VO4, 80 μM glycerophosphate, 20% glycerol, 1 mM
PMSF, 5 μg/ml each of pepstain, leupeptin, chymostatin,
antipain, and aprotinin), sonicated and centrifuged for
15 min at 16,000 x g at 4°C. Proteins in the supernatant
were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically
transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes. Nonspecific binding was blocked for 1 h with 5% bovine
serum albumin or non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline
(4 mM Tris base, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) containing
0.05% Tween 20. Membranes were incubated with
primary antibody overnight at 4°C, and then for 1 h with
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Blots were
developed using Supersignal Chemiluminescent Substrate
(Pierce, Rockford, IL).
