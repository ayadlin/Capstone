Abstract
Agents that trigger cell differentiation are highly efﬁcacious in
treating certain cancers, but such approaches are not generally
effective in most malignancies. Compounds such as DMSO and
hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) have been used to induce
differentiation in experimental systems, but their mechanisms of
action and potential range of uses on that basis have not been
developed. Here, we show that HMBA, a compound ﬁrst tested in
the oncology clinic over 25 years ago, acts as a selective bromodomain inhibitor. Biochemical and structural studies revealed an
afﬁnity of HMBA for the second bromodomain of BET proteins.
Accordingly, both HMBA and the prototype BET inhibitor JQ1

induced differentiation of mouse erythroleukemia cells. As
expected of a BET inhibitor, HMBA displaced BET proteins from
chromatin, caused massive transcriptional changes, and triggered
cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in Myc-induced B-cell lymphoma
cells. Furthermore, HMBA exerted anticancer effects in vivo in
mouse models of Myc-driven B-cell lymphoma. This study illuminates the function of an early anticancer agent and suggests an
intersection with ongoing clinical trials of BET inhibitor, with
several implications for predicting patient selection and response
rates to this therapy and starting points for generating BD2selective BET inhibitors. Cancer Res; 76(8); 2376–83. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

and colleagues (8) could not demonstrate that it inhibited
HDACs.
The function of BET bromodomain proteins (BRD2, BRD3,
BRD4, and BRDT) is to bind acetylated proteins, most notably
histones, and thereby regulate transcription (11). BET bromodomain inhibitors (BETi) block this binding, resulting in broad
transcriptional changes (12–16). Recently, we demonstrated
that vorinostat triggers transcriptional changes that are overlapping with those induced by BETi in murine Myc-induced
lymphoma cells (17). Given our data that BETi and HDACi can
induce similar transcriptional changes (17), we hypothesized
that the target of HMBA could be one or several BET bromodomain proteins.

The idea of tumor cell differentiation was conceptualized when
Charlotte Friend showed that the solvent DMSO was capable of
inducing differentiation of virus-induced mouse erythroleukemia
(MEL) cells (1). Because the FDA had banned DMSO for human
use, Tanaka and colleagues (2) initiated a search for polar compounds that would be able to induce MEL cell differentiation at
lower concentrations. The most effective compound was hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA; ref. 3). It was developed as far as to
the clinic where it showed acceptable toxicity proﬁles in phase I
clinical trials and activity against one quarter of patients with acute
myelogenous leukemia (AML) in phase II trials. However, likely
due to low response rates, HMBA was not further developed after
1992 (4–7). Parallel to the development of HMBA, Richon and
colleagues (8) also discovered the target of a much more potent
MEL differentiation agent, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid
(SAHA). They demonstrated that SAHA is a potent inhibitor of
histone deacetylases (HDAC), which spawned active investigations and clinical development. SAHA, or vorinostat, is now FDAapproved for treatment of cutaneous T-cell leukemia (9) and
other HDAC inhibitors are approved for use in other tumor types.
The target of HMBA remained elusive though (10) because Richon

described (18). The MEL cells were a kind gift from Dr. Olle Heby

(Umea University) and were cultured in DMEM supplemented
with 20 % FBS and antibiotics. They were only authenticated in
this study by showing their differentiation to erythrocytes (Fig. 1).
All animal experiments were performed in accordance with
regional/local animal ethics committee approval (approval number 287/2011 and 193/2014). C57BL/6 mice were transplanted
with 200,000 l2749 lymphoma cells (17). White blood cell
(WBC) counts were measured by blood sampling from vena
saphena. When WBC counts were above the normal range (6–
15 cells/nL), mice were treated with bi-daily intraperitoneal
injections of HMBA or left untreated.

RNA preparation and analyses
l820 (in biologic replicates) were cultured in the absence or
presence of 5 mmol/L HMBA for 24 hours. RNA was prepared
using the NucleoSpin RNA II Kit (Macherey-Nagel). The analysis
of gene expression was performed using the Illumina BeadChip
system at the Genomics Core Facility, University of Gothenburg,
Sweden. Mouse Ref-8 v2 Beadchip Arrays (Illumina) were used
following the manufacturer's protocol. Primary data were collected from the BeadChips using the Illumina BeadArray Reader
(HiScan) and analyzed using the supplied software. Data normalization was performed by cubic spline normalization using
Illumina's GenomeStudio software equipped with the necessary
modules. Before further analysis, FORCEPOS adjustment (þ25)

was performed to avoid negative data arising during normalization. To compare data with those generated previously from JQ1treated or vorinostat-treated cells (17), all data from compoundtreated cells were normalized to their respective experimental
controls (untreated cells for HMBA, 0.1% DMSO-treated cells for
JQ1 and vorinostat). Full datasets are available as Supplementary
Dataset S1. Clustering and visualization of genes was performed
using Spotﬁre. Gene-set enrichment analysis was done using the
Qlucore software.
For quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), total
RNA was prepared from cultured cells or tumors. cDNA was
prepared from 500 ng total RNA using the iScript cDNA Synthesis
Kit (Bio-Rad). qRT-PCR was performed using KAPA SYBR FAST
ABI Prism 2X qPCR Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems, Inc.). Data
analyses were performed by comparing DDCt values, using Ubiquitin (Ub) as the reference gene and with a control sample set as
relative expression 1.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was carried out using
the manufacturer's protocol (SimpleChIP Plus Enzymatic Chromatin IP Kit; Cell Signaling Technology). Brieﬂy, cells left untreated or treated with HMBA for 18 hours were ﬁxed with formaldehyde and lysed; chromatin was partially digested by micrococcal
nuclease and then sonicated. Lysates were quantiﬁed and 10 mg of
chromatin was loaded per immunoprecipitation and the rest was
used as input. ChIP was carried out using antibodies directed
against Brd2 (rabbit; Bethyl Laboratories), Brd3 (mouse; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), or Brd4 (rabbit; Bethyl Laboratories), where
anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG was used as an isotype control.
Puriﬁed and reverse cross-linked chromatin was analyzed by
quantitative PCR using primers designed against, Cd74 (17), Srm
(19), and Vpreb3.
Biochemical assays
HMBA at ﬁve different concentrations (5, 0.5 mmol/L, 50, 5,
0.5 mmol/L, and 50 nmol/L) was proﬁled against 10 different
bromodomain (BRD) protein fragments and rat liver HDAC. For
all assays, reference compounds were used to validate the assays.
For BRD proteins, binding of recombinant human proteins to
biotinylated and acetylated histone peptides was detected using
the AlphaScreen detection method as previously described (20).
For HDAC, a ﬂuorimetric method was used that had been previously described (21).
Structure determination
Molecular docking of BRD2 bromodomain 2 (PDB# 2E3K)
to JQ1 or HMBA was performed using the Swissdock server
(www.swissdock.ch/). Input ligands were imported from the
ZINC database. The resulting docking results were visualized in
Chimera.
For crystallization, His-tagged BRD3 bromodomain 2 (BRD3
BD2) was expressed in E. coli and puriﬁed on a Ni-NTA column as
previously described (20). The His-tag was removed by TEV
protease cleavage followed by an additional puriﬁcation on NiNTA column. BRD3 BD2 was concentrated to 42.1 mg/mL in 20
mmol/L HEPES, 500 mmol/L NaCl, 5 % glycerol, pH 7.5. Crystallizations were then done using a mosquito robot (TTP Labtech).
Before crystallization, the buffer was changed using a micron
centrifugal ﬁlter with a cutoff value of 10 kDa. The crystallization

2378 Cancer Res; 76(8) April 15, 2016

buffer contained 10 mmol/L HEPES pH 7.5 and 300 mmol/L
NaCl. Crystals were grown by vapor diffusion at 4 C from a sitting
drop consisting of 150 nL protein (10 mg/mL) and 150 nL
reservoir solution containing 19% PEG 6000, 0.1 mol/L HEPES
pH 7.0. The crystals appeared after a few days and had a size of 60
 60  15 mm. For soaking, the crystal was transferred to a drop
containing 19 % PEG 6000, 0.1 mol/L HEPES pH 7.0 and 50
mmol/L HMBA for 20 hours. The crystal was then transferred to a
cryoprotectant solution containing 19 % PEG6000, 0.1 mol/L
HEPES pH 7.0, 25 % ethylene glycol and 50 mmol/L HMBA and
ﬂash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
A BRD3 BD2 dataset was collected to 1.9 Å at 100 K at beam line
I911-3, MAX IV laboratory (l ¼ 1.0000 Å). One hundred and
sixty-ﬁve images in total, each with 1 rotation, were collected. All
data were integrated and scaled using XDS and Aimless softwares.
The structure of BRD3-BD2 in complex with HMBA was determined by rigid body reﬁnement of an in-house apo structure to
1.5 Åresolution. Ligand conformations were created using software from Schr€
odinger, LLC. After initial anatomic reﬁnement of
the protein coordinates in Refmac5 the coordinates of HMBA
were ﬁtted to the electron density using the Coot software. CCP4style restraints for HMBA were generated using the Jligand program. The structures were reﬁned to convergence using Refmac5.
The protein structure quality was checked using the Molprobity
server. Hydrogen atoms were added in the riding positions. Water
molecules were added to positive difference density peaks more
than 5 SDs above the mean and present in 2m|Fo|-d|Fc| map at
the 1 sigma level.
Accession codes: Coordinates and structure factors have
been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession
code 5A7C.
Hemoglobin measurement
Cells were washed twice in PBS, dissolved in water and
freeze-thawed three times. After a 30-min centrifugation at
15,000  g the absorbance spectrum of the supernatant was
measured on a Nanodrop spectrophotometer. Whole blood
from a mouse was diluted and processed the same way as the
cells and was used a positive control. Presence of hemoglobin
in the sample was evident by the presence of peaks at 414, 540
and 576 nm.

Results
HMBA cause MEL cell differentiation by acting as a selective
BD2 inhibitor
JQ1 is a potent BETi (16), which binds to bromodomain 1
and 2 (BD1 and BD2) in all BET bromodomain proteins.
Consistent with the hypothesis that HMBA could be a BET
inhibitor, molecular docking in silico shows that HMBA ﬁts the
same pocket in BD2 of BRD2 as JQ1 (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Because HMBA is a small polar molecule that potentially could
ﬁt many pockets, we also measured binding of bromodomaincontaining proteins to acetylated histone peptides in the

presence of increasing concentrations of HMBA or known
ligands. This demonstrated that HMBA could displace BD2 in
BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4, with the highest afﬁnity to BRD3
(Table 1 and Fig. 1A). On the other hand, as previously shown
(8), HMBA does not inhibit HDACs (Table 1).
To assess whether HMBA's interactions with BET proteins were
speciﬁc, we soaked crystals of the second bromodomain of BRD3
with HMBA and determined the X-ray crystal structure of the
complex. Electron density maps revealed unambiguous density
for bound HMBA (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig. S1B). There are
four molecules of BRD3 BD2 in the asymmetric unit. HMBA is
fully visible in the electron density for subunit A and is bound in
the acetyl-lysine pocket of BRD3 BD2 (Fig. 1B). For the other three
subunits the acetamide binding to Asn391 and the conserved
water molecules is very similar, but the tail and the second
acetamide are poorly visible in the electron density, indicating
ﬂexibility. Furthermore, in subunit A there are two water molecules from a symmetry-related molecule interacting with the
second acetamide, which could explain why the entire ligand is
only visible in the electron density for this subunit. The surrounding crystallographic environment is not the same for the other
subunits. When superimposing all subunits, it becomes clear that
the linker and the second acetamide are ﬂexible (Supplementary
Fig. S1C and S1D). Of interest is also that HMBA makes a
hydrogen bond with His395 in one of the subunits. Because this
position is conserved in the BC-loop of the BD2 domain of all BET
proteins, and as BD1 has an Asp at the corresponding position
(20), it is tempting to speculate that this is the reason behind the
apparent BD2 selectivity of HMBA.
BET proteins belong to a larger family of bromodomain-containing proteins, the BRD family (20). Given HMBA's small size, it
requires 3 to 5 mmol/L in concentration to exhibit most effects in
cell culture. Hence, it was of importance to investigate whether
HMBA could bind more proteins than the BD2 domain of BET
proteins. Analyzing representative proteins of different branches
of the BRD family tree, we found that the bromodomain of the
histone acetyltransferase EP300 was also inhibited from binding
acetylated histone (Table 1).
Next, we evaluated the effects of HMBA and JQ1 on mouse
erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. We reasoned that if HMBA
induced differentiation by blocking BET proteins then the
prototype BET inhibitor JQ1 should also induce differentiation
of MEL. Indeed, treatment of MEL cells with either 5 mmol/L
HMBA or 0.1 mmol/L JQ1 resulted in formation of red cells,
indicative that hemoglobin has been produced (Fig. 1C). Conﬁrming this, lysates of HMBA- or JQ1-treated MEL cells exhibited the same absorbance spectra as did mouse blood (Fig. 1D)
and qRT-PCR analysis showed that both JQ1 and HMBA induce
the expression of the hemoglobin-encoding gene Hba-a1 (Fig.
1E). These data suggest that BET inhibition is sufﬁcient to trigger
differentiation of MEL cells. However, inhibiting EP300 with
the selective inhibitor C646 (22), or histone acetyltransferase
GCN5 with the selective inhibitor CPTH2 (23), does not result
in differentiation (Fig. 1C). This suggests that HMBA's effect on
differentiation is mediated by inhibiting BET proteins and not
by inhibiting acetyltransferases in general.
HMBA kills Myc-induced lymphoma cells in vitro and in vivo
In the clinic, the therapeutic effects of HMBA were only modest.
Because we previously demonstrated that BETi such as JQ1 and
RVX2135 arrest and kill Myc transgenic murine lymphoma cells

(17), we were interested to investigate whether Myc-overexpressing cells would be sensitive to HMBA. To that end, cultured l820
and l663 cells, developed from l-Myc transgenic mice, were
treated with HMBA. Similar to the effects seen with other BETi
(17), HMBA induced a cell-cycle arrest at 24 hours followed by
apoptosis of all cells by 48 hours (Fig. 2A and data not shown). We
also treated two lymphoma lines developed from Em-Myc transgenic mice (24), and two human Burkitt lymphoma cell line. We
observed robust antiproliferative effects after 24 hours in the
murine lines (Fig. 2A) whereas the effects in Burkitt lymphoma
cell line were slower (Fig. 2B).
Next, we performed microarray analyses of l820 cells treated
with HMBA and compared the data with those of previously
performed expression proﬁles of JQ1 or the HDACi vorinostat
(SAHA)–treated cells (17). As shown in Fig. 3A, unsupervised
hierarchical clustering analysis of the 2-fold up- and downregulated genes (by all compounds, Supplementary Dataset S1) shows
that HMBA clusters more closely with JQ1 than with vorinostat.
Moreover, 56 % of genes suppressed and 68 % of genes induced
(>2-fold) by JQ1 are also regulated in the same way by HMBA,
whereas that similarity was lower for vorinostat-regulated genes
(36% similarity of both induced and suppressed genes, Fig. 3B). In
our previous study, it was demonstrated that HDACi and BETi
regulate a few genes in each other's opposite directions (17).
Indeed, the expressions of genes like Cd74, which are induced
by vorinostat but repressed by JQ, were also repressed by HMBA
(Fig. 3A, inset and Fig. 3C). Furthermore, ingenuity pathway
analyses of 2-fold up- and downregulated genes showed high
similarities between JQ1 and HMBA. Of the 10 pathways most
affected by both compounds, six were of lymphocyte development or signaling (e.g., B-cell development shown in Supplementary Fig. S2), and four were of cell-cycle regulation (e.g.,
Supplementary Fig. S3). Accordingly, investigation of the MutSigDB database and follow-up gene-set enrichment analysis
showed that genes repressed by HMBA were enriched in genes
induced in S-phase by E2f (Supplementary Fig. S4), as previously shown for JQ1 (25). Finally, a ChIP assay experiment
demonstrated that Brd2 and Brd4, but not Brd3, was clearly
displaced by HMBA from the regulatory regions of the Spermidine synthase (Srm) gene (Fig. 3D), a gene whose expression was
suppressed by HMBA (Supplementary Dataset S1). Taken
together, the data strongly suggest that HMBA is a BETi also
in Myc-induced lymphoma cells.

HMBA was never shown to be efﬁcacious in mouse models of
cancer, but was moved into clinical trials based on overwhelming
in vitro data. Having established that HMBA kills Myc-induced
lymphoma cells in vitro, we were interested in investigating
whether antitumoral activity could be observed in this tumor
type. We transplanted mice with l2749 cells, which originally
developed in a l-Myc transgenic mouse and has been maintained since by serial transplantation in syngenic recipient B6
mice. Mice transplanted with these cells develop a lethal lymphoma that can be monitored by measuring whether the WBC
count is above the normal range (6–15 cells/nL; ref.17). Treatment with the BETi RVX2135 results in a rapid reduction of WBC
(17) and prolonged survival, making this an optimal model to
assess effects of HMBA in vivo. As seen in Fig. 4A, treatment of
mice with HMBA carrying l2749 cells resulted in a normalization of WBC, and this translated to a prolonged survival of these
mice (Fig. 4B). To investigate whether HMBA exhibited activity

injected into mice. The l663 cells do not display traditional
growth pattern with growth primarily in lymph nodes and
spleen. Instead the mice transplanted develop hind leg paralysis. Labeling the cells with luciferase demonstrated that the
lymphoma cells in these mice indeed propagate in the bone
marrow (Fig. 4C). Although the disease was not ameliorated by
HMBA, the progression was signiﬁcantly blunted (Fig. 4C).
Taken together, we here demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that
HMBA has activity against Myc-driven lymphoma in vivo.

Discussion
In this report, we have established that HMBA has the ability to
inhibit at least four members of the BRD family. Our data also
suggest starting points for synthesis of BD2-selective BET inhibitors. Identiﬁcation of the targets is important because HMBA
continues to be used as a differentiation agent and continues to
be instrumental for identifying mechanisms of transcriptional

mice were injected with l663 cells and
randomized to two groups, one
receiving 1,500 mg/kg/d of HMBA, and
the other left untreated. Mice were
monitored for the development of hind
leg paralysis, at which time they were
sacriﬁced. Inset, l663 cells were labeled
with luciferase using retroviral
transduction (pBABE-luc-hygro) and
were transplanted into C57BL/6Tyrosinase knockout mice (B6 albino) via
tail-vein injection. Twelve days after
transplantation mice were injected with

elongation (26). Our data suggest that HMBA can be exchanged
for more selective and potent BET bromodomain inhibitors in the
study of differentiation.
More than 25 years ago, HMBA was used in patients suffering
from many different malignancies, most notably AML. Current
clinical investigators could learn from the HMBA trials that certain
toxicities, for example, thrombocytopenia, need to be managed,
and, unfortunately, few patients are likely to respond. The presented data suggest that MYC overexpression could be a biomarker of response to BET inhibitors. This was not known when the
HMBA trials were conducted, so it is plausible that the trials would
have generated better results if patients suffering from Myc-driven
diseases had been recruited. Re-evaluating HMBA as a drug to treat
Myc-induced cancers such as multiple myeloma, glioblastoma,
neuroblastoma, and small-cell lung cancer is ongoing in animal
models in our laboratory.
Although not formally proven here, our data also suggest
that BET inhibition could be the reason for the induction of
differentiation by DMSO. Indeed, DMSO is generally advised
against as solvent of compounds for use in bromodomain
protein–binding assays or in crystallization studies, because it
can bind and inhibit bromodomains by displacing essential
water molecules (27). It is tempting to speculate that BET
protein inhibition could explain why high concentrations
(>1%) of DMSO have many biologic effects such as inducing
differentiation or killing tumor cells or blocking inﬂammation.
Speculatively, it could also explain why cultured cells need time
to recover after cryopreservation—they have been soaked in
10% of a BET inhibitor.
