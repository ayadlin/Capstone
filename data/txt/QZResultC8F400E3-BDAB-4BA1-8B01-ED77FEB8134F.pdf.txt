ABSTRACT
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a sub-population of tumor cells playing essential
roles in initiation, differentiation, recurrence, metastasis and development of drug
resistance of various cancers, including bladder cancer. Although multiple lines of
evidence suggest that metformin is capable of repressing CSC repopulation in different
cancers, the effect of metformin on bladder cancer CSCs remains largely unknown.
Using the N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced rat orthotropic bladder cancer
model, we demonstrated that metformin is capable of repressing bladder cancer
progression from both mild to moderate/severe dysplasia lesions and from carcinoma
in situ (CIS) to invasive lesions. Metformin also can arrest bladder cancer cells in
G1/S phases, which subsequently leads to apoptosis. And also metformin represses
bladder cancer CSC repopulation evidenced by reducing cytokeratin 14 (CK14+) and
octamer-binding transcription factor 3/4 (OCT3/4+) cells in both animal and cellular
models. More importantly, we found that metformin exerts these anticancer effects by
inhibiting COX2, subsequently PGE2 as well as the activation of STAT3. In conclusion,
we are the first to systemically demonstrate in both animal and cell models that
metformin inhibits bladder cancer progression by inhibiting stem cell repopulation
through the COX2/PGE2/STAT3 axis.

cells, whereas intermediate cells serve as the progenitors
of papillary carcinomas [17]. In addition and similar
to that epithelial tumors constitute heterogeneous cell
populations [18], while bladder cancer comprises cells at
different differentiation stages [8, 12]. Cells expressing
CK14 were considered the least differentiated population,
which are also known as CSC or tumor initial cells (TIC).
More importantly, it has been demonstrated that elevated
levels of CK14+ cells correlate with poor survival [19].
Accumulating evidence also supports the notion that CSCs
are responsible for tumor initiation, relapse, metastasis, as
well as chemo- and radio-resistance [20]. A recent study
[21] demonstrated that ablation of basal stem cells is
capable of preventing bladder cancer development. Given

INTRODUCTION
Bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer
in the US [1] and about 90% of them are urothelial
carcinomas with muscle-invasive lesions, papillary lesions
and CIS; while the other 10% are distributed between
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma
[2, 3]. Although both CIS and papillary lesions belong
to superficial urothelial carcinomas, they show different
morphologies as well as invasive potentials. Therefore, it
has been suggested that CIS and papillary lesions arise
from different cell types or harbor distinct mutations [416]. Indeed, supportive evidence has shown that both
CIS and invasive urothelial carcinoma arise from basal

the fact that CSCs are mainly derived from basal stem
cells, CSCs are likely to play a pivotal role in bladder
cancer initiation and progression.
Although metformin is mainly considered as a
antidiabetic agent [22], it has also showed anticancer effect
in many cancer types, including melanoma [23], colon
cancer [24], ovarian cancer [25], prostate cancer [26] and
bladder cancer [27] by enhancing cancer cell apoptosis,
inhibiting epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and
targeting cancer stem cells. These effects were evidenced
by the fact that metformin can also synergize with certain
chemotherapeutic drugs [28-33]. For example, metformin
not only inhibits breast tumor cell growth [34, 35] but also
selectively represses the CSCs [31]. Results from bladder
cancer research suggest that metformin may be capable
of inhibiting cancer cell growth [36] and blocking tumor
progression from precancerous to invasive tumors [37].
Upregulated cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a key
enzyme in prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) biosynthesis
pathway, has been reported in different cancers including
bladder cancer [38, 39]. In N-butyl-4-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)
nitrosamine (BBN)-induced rat urinary bladder cancer
model, COX-2 is also upregulated in both pre-neoplastic
and neoplastic lesions [40] and elevated expression of
COX-2 is correlated with higher levels of PGE2 in many
cancers [41]. Furthermore, it appears that PGE2 plays
important roles in CSC repopulation of different cancers
including bladder cancer [42, 43]. Mechanistically,
COX2/PGE2 is likely to play an important role in CSC
repopulation through activating the JAK2 (Janus kinase 2)/
STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3)
signaling pathway [44]. Accumulating evidence indicates
that alterations in JAK/STAT pathway are involved in
oncogenesis [45]. In liver tumor initiation, the STAT3upregulated NANOG CD24+ (cluster of differentiation
24+) CSCs is believed to play an important role [46].
Finally, in Stat3-transgenic mice with BBN-induced
bladder cancer, an early expansion of CK14+ stem cells
has been observed [47]. In this research, we demonstrated
that metformin is capable of repressing bladder cancer
CSC repopulation through inhibiting the COX2/PGE2/
STAT3 axis in both animal and cellular models.

bladder tumors in rat model treated with or without MET.
The average numbers of lesions in animals treated with
and without metformin were plotted (Figure 1E). As
shown in Figure 1E (left pane) that at week 3, the total
number of mild dysplasia lesions in MNU and MET
groups were comparable (24 lesions/10 rats in the MNU
group vs 28 lesions/10 rats in the MET group, P=0.466).
However, the number of moderate/severe dysplasia
lesions in animals treated with metformin (MET group,
16/10 rats) is significantly lower than that in MNU group
(36/10 rats) (P=0.007). At week 6 (Figure 1E, middle
panel), metformin treatment increased the number of mild
dysplasia lesions significantly with 29 mild dysplasia
lesions/8 rats in MET group compared with 15 lesions/8
rats in MNU group (P=0.026); but decreased the number
of moderate/severe dysplasia lesions dramatically with 5
moderate/severe dysplasia in MET group compared with
30 lesions/8 rats in MNU group (P=0.02). In addition, 3
CIS lesions were also seen in the MNU group with none
of such lesion in the MET group. At week 12 (Figure
1E, right pane), there were more papillary tumor lesions
in MET group than that of MNU group (53 lesions/20
rats in MET group vs 19 lesions/14 rats in MNU group,
P=0.03). However, the invasive lesions in MET group
(46 invasive lesions/20 rats) are significantly less than
that of MNU group (49 lesions/14 rats) (P=0.034). These
data altogether suggest that metformin may not be able
to inhibit bladder cancer initiation but be capable of
repressing the progression from mild to moderate/severe
dysplasia lesions and from CIS to invasive lesions.

Metformin inhibits cancer cell growth and
enhances apoptosis
Next, we decided to use bladder cancer cell
lines to dissect the mechanisms of metformin effects
on cancer progression. To test if metformin can affect
bladder cancer cell growth, we treated two bladder
cancer cell lines T24 and RT4 with or without 20 mM
of metformin for 5 days and the numbers of viable cells
were estimated by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide). Figure 2A shows
that metformin is able to inhibit both T24 (left panel)
and RT4 (right panel) cell growth. AMPK (Adenosine
Monophosphate Activated Protein Kinase) is a wellestablished molecular target of metformin [33, 35]. We
estimated the levels of the phosphorylated AMPK in T24
cells treated with different concentrations of metformin.
Figure 2B shows that metformin is capable of upregulating
the phosphorylation of AMPK in a dose-dependent
manner without affecting the level of total AMPK. In
addition, results from western blotting assays showed that
metformin is capable of repressing the levels of cyclin D1
and Bcl-2 in both cell lines in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 2C). Then, we estimated the effect of metformin
on cell cycles distribution by treating T24 cells with

Effects of metformin on bladder cancer

We decided to use the MNU (N-methyl-Nnitrosourea)-induced rat orthotopic bladder cancer model
to examine if metformin (MET) has any effect on bladder
cancer initiation and progression. The experimental
scheme is shown in Figure 1A and the general features of
the MNU-induced bladder cancer treated with or without
MET were shown in Supplementary Table S1, S2, and

that metformin treatment increased the cell populations
in G1/S phases and decreased the population in G2
phase. Furthermore, the apoptotic cell populations were
upregulated by metformin in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 2E). More importantly, immunohistochemical

staining showed the expression of Ki67 (Figure 3A) and
Bcl-2 (Figure 3B) in bladder specimens were significantly
repressed by metformin treatment. Of note, not only the
intensity of Ki67 but also the numbers of Ki67-positive
cells were significantly reduced in metformin-treated
group at all time points (Supplementary Table S4 and

early CIS and invasive cancer progression.

Metformin selectively inhibits repopulation of
bladder cancer stem cells

Metformin inhibits COX2/PGE2/STAT3 axis by
downregulating COX2

It has been suggested that bladder cancers arise from
distinct urothelial sub-populations with CIS and invasive
urothelial carcinoma arising from basal cells and papillary
carcinomas deriving from intermediate cells. In order to
determine if metformin exerts distinct effect on different
precursor cells, we examined the expression of two stem
cell markers, CK14 and OCT3/4 in tumors derived from
animals treated with or without metformin. As shown in
Figure 4 that metformin treatment reduced the number of
CK14- (Figure 4A) and OCT3/4-positive cells (Figure 4B,
Supplementary Table S4 and Supplementary Figure S2).
On the other hand, at all time points examined (3, 6 and 12
weeks) more CK20-positive cells were seen in the tissues
of the animals treated with metformin (Supplementary
Figure S1). It appears that metformin selectively inhibits

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that PGE2 is
an important inducer of CSC repopulation in different
cancers including bladder cancer [42]. To dissect the
mechanism of metformin inhibition of CK14- and
OCT3/4-positive cell repopulation, we examined the effect
of metformin on COX2, a key enzyme catalyzing the
biosynthesis of PGE2. Figure 5A shows that metformin
is capable of repressing the expression of COX2 at all
time points in both papillary and invasive lesions. These
observations were further substantiated by the dosedependent inhibition of COX2 in vitro when T24 cells
were treated with different concentrations of metformin
(Figure 6A). Consistent with COX2 inhibition, the levels
of PGE2 in culture media were significantly lower when

the cells were treated with metformin (Figure 6B). Based
on the facts that in colorectal cancer the JAK2/STAT3
signaling pathway is regulated by PGE2 [44], and STAT3
is not only involved in the expansion of CK14-positive
stem cells in bladder cancer [47], but STAT3 activation
in urothelial stem cells also leads to invasive bladder
cancer progression, we decided to examine if metformininhibited bladder cancer development is through the
COX2/PGE2/STAT3 axis. Immunohistochemistry (Figure
5B, Supplementary Table S4 and Supplementary Figure
S2) shows the levels of p-STAT3 in the bladder cancer
animal model treated with metformin are consistently
lower. These observations were further substantiated by
the dose-dependent downregulation of phosphorylated
STAT3 in cellular model (Figure 6A). Of note, metformin
treatment has no effect on the levels of total STAT3.
Consistent with downregulation of the levels of COX2
and PGE2 as well as inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation/
activation, the levels of both CK14 and OCT3/4 were
repressed by metformin in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 6A); suggesting metformin may repress bladder
cancer development through the COX2/STAT3 pathway.
To further substantiate our hypothesis, we treated
T24 cells with either a COX2 specific inhibitor celecoxib,

or different concentrations of metformin. As showed in
Figure 6C, metformin repressed all above-mentioned
factors as celecoxib did. In addition, we knocked down
COX2 in T24 cells by siRNA technique and monitored
the changes of the molecules including COX2, STAT3,
p-STAT3, CK14 and OCT3/4. As shown in Figure 6D,
both siCOX2-1 and siCOX2-3 knocked down COX2
efficaciously but for some unknown reason that siCOX2-2
failed to knock down COX2. When COX2 is knocked
down (lanes 2 and 4 in Figure 6D), all three markers
p-STAT3, CK14 and OCT3/4 were downregulated
significantly. However, the total STAT3 levels were not
affected at all. To demonstrate that metformin affects CSC
repopulation through PGE2, we treated the cells with
metformin in the presence or absence of exogenously
added PGE2. Figure 6E shows that exogenously added
PGE2 is able to counteract metformin and upregulate all
CSC markers tested without affecting the levels of COX2;
demonstrating the essentiality of PGE2 in bladder cancer
stem cell repopulation. These data collectively suggest
that metformin represses CK14+ stem cell repopulation
by downregulating COX2 and subsequently inhibiting
the COX2/PGE2/STAT3 axis. However, we noticed that
high concentration (10mM) of metformin is capable of

inhibiting the levels of both CK14 and OCT3/4 by directly
repressing STAT3 phosphorylation/activation even in the
presence of exogenous PGE2, a phenomenon has been
observed previously [37]. This suggests that metformin
may also be able to repress bladder cancer development
through a COX2-independent manner.

metformin suppressed bladder cancer development by
inhibiting cancer stem cell repopulation via the COX2/
PGE2/STAT3 axis (Figure 7).
Carcinogen-induced rat bladder tumor is a
well-established model system, which has been widely
used in bladder cancer researches for decades. BBN
(N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)
nitrosamine),
MNU
(N-methyl-N-nitrosourea) and FANFT (N-[4-(5-nitro-2furyl)-2-thiazolyl]-formamide) are the most commonlyused carcinogenic inducers. Compared to the models
induced by BBN and FANFT, both of them must be taken
orally, establishing the MNU-induced model is much
easier, quicker and cheaper [48]. On the other hand,
comparing to cell transplantation model, tumors in animal
models more closely represent human bladder tumors in
histology, biochemical properties, molecular and genetic
characteristics, natural history and biological behavior.
In addition, the carcinogen-induced tumor is a more ideal
system for studying both tumor initiation and progression
including dysplasia, CIS, papillary and invasive cancers.
It is the animal model that enabled us to differentiate the
effects of metformin on tumor progression from initiation.
Therefore, we believe that this model system would also
be more ideal in studying the pathogenesis, prevention and
potential bladder cancer therapies.

DISCUSSION
Using the MNU-induced rat orthotopic bladder
cancer model we demonstrated the anti-tumor effects of
metformin and explored its underlying mechanism with
experiments in bladder cancer cell lines. Data from both
in vitro and in vivo experiments suggest that metformin
may not be able to prevent bladder cancer initiation
but it appeared to be capable of slowing down the
progression both from mild to moderate/severe dysplasia
lesions and from CIS lesions to invasive lesions. By
directly downregulating COX2, metformin is able to
downregulate the level of PGE2, which subsequently
leads to reduced STAT3 phosphorylation/activation.
Attenuated STAT3 signaling pathway results in reduced
levels of cyclinD1 and Bcl-2, which caused cancer cells
being arrested in G1/S phases and ultimately apoptotic
cell death. Based on these findings, we proposed that

It has been noticed recently that the anticancer effect
of metformin may rely on its role in CSC inhibition [49].
Metformin inhibits CSCs repopulation in different cancers
including colon cancer [50], pancreatic [51], esophageal
cancer [52], skin cancer [53] and ovarian cancer [54].
CSCs are a sub-population of cancer cells responsible for
tumor initiation, differentiation, recurrence, metastasis,
and drug resistance [20]. Patients with muscle-invasive
bladder cancer showed higher recurrence rate and poor
survival. Furthermore, it is believed that CSCs play
important roles in the development of resistance to
multiple chemotherapies [20]. There are many wellestablished CSC markers, including cytokeratin 5 (CK5),
cytokeratin 14 (CK14) and aldehyde dehydrogenase
1 family, member A1 (ALDH1A1). In human bladder
cancer, the primitive stem cell marker CK14 also serves
as the precursor of CK5 [12]. This means that CK14+ cells
are scattered and represent only a subpopulation of CK5+
urothelial cells. We found that metformin is able to dosedependently repress CK14+ cells in animal model and

downregulate the levels of CK14 in bladder cancer cell
lines. To our knowledge, we are the first to systemically
demonstrate that metformin inhibits bladder cancer
development by directly targeting CSC repopulation.
It has been well-established that metformin plays
important roles in different signaling pathways, including
AMPK/mTOR [36], TGF-β/IL-6 [56], Wnt/β-catenin
[57]; autophagy pathway [58], EMT [30]. The current
body of evidence is inadequate to establish an absolute
protective role of metformin in bladder cancer [59]. But
in consistence with that reported by Pan et al [37], our
results support the notion that metformin represses bladder
cancer development through STAT3 signaling pathway. In
addition to that, we demonstrated that metformin inhibits
bladder cancer cell growth and enhances apoptosis by
downregulating cyclinD1 and Bcl-2. Also consistent
with that reported by Zhang et al [36], we showed that
metformin dose-dependently arrests bladder cancer cells
in G1/S phases and subsequent apoptosis. Based on the
fact that (1) metformin is able to inhibit COX2 [60];

(2) PGE2, a product catalyzed by COX2, is capable of
promoting stem cell expansion [61] and mobilization [62];
and (3) blocking PGE2 abrogates bladder cancer chemoresistance by repressing CK14+ cells repopulation [62],
we explored the possibility of metformin effect on COX2/
PGE2 pathway and found that metformin is indeed capable
of downregulating COX2 and subsequently reducing the
level of PGE2. Since STAT3, a downstream target of
COX2/PGE2, is involved in the regulation of primitive
CK14+ cell expansion [47], we propose that in bladder
cancer metformin inhibits CK14+ cell repopulation
through the COX2/PGE2/STAT3 axis.
In conclusion, to our best knowledge that we are the
first to use both cell and animal models to systemically
demonstrate that metformin inhibits bladder cancer
progression by inhibiting cancer stem cell repopulation
through the COX2/PGE2/STAT3 axis. Given the fact
that metformin is capable of repressing bladder cancer
progression, administration of metformin to bladder cancer
patients may extend therapeutic period for application of
other cancer treatments.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Metformin and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)
treatment protocol
Adult female SD rats at 5-6 weeks of age
were obtained from Animal Experimental Center of
Daping Hospital, Third Military Medical University
(Chongqing, China) and housed in the research center.
Animal experiments in this study were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Third
Military Medical University. Animals were fed with
standard laboratory rat chow with free access of tap
water. Rats were divided into three groups: control group;
N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-treated group (MNU group);
and MNU + metformin (MET group) (Figure 1A). For
MNU treatment, 2.5 mg of MNU (SICHUAN HANOVI
TECHNOLOGY) dissolved in sodium citrate buffer (5
g/L) was irrigated into the rat bladders via epidural catheter
every 3 weeks (i.e. week 0, 3, 6, 9). The rats in MET group
access tap water with metformin (1 g/L) freely. Rats were
sacrificed at week 3 (n=30), week 6 (n=26), and week 12
(n=44), respectively. Blood was drawn from each rat and
used for glucose measurement. The bladders were fixed
in 10% formalin and paraffin embedded for hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E) and immunostaining examination was
conducted by Hualiang Xiao, a certificated pathologist.

Analysis of cell cycle and apoptosis
T24 Cells were seeded in 75 cm2 flasks and serumstarved for 24 h. Metformin was added to the culture to
final concentrations of 0, 1, 5, 10, 20 mM and incubated
for 24 h. Cells were washed with cold PBS for three times,
resuspended in 70% ethanol used for analysis of cell cycle
distribution, or directly Annexin V binding buffer used for
analysis of apoptosis status.

Western blotting
T24 or RT4 cells were seeded in 6-well plates 2×105
cells/well, treated with corresponding reagents, including
metformin (0, 1 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM, 20 mM), Celecoxib (20
μM YUANYE BioTECH, Shanghai, China) and PGE2(10
μM, Sigma). Cell lysates were separated on SDS-PAGE
followed by western blotting assay as described [26] with
the following primary antibodies: Bcl-2 (1:1000 Epitomics),
Cyclin D1 (1:1000 Fantibody, China), CK14 (1:400 Abcam),
STAT3 (1:2000 Abcam), OCT3/4 (1:400 Santa Cruz Biotechnology), COX2 (1:2000 Origene), p-STAT3 (Tyr705) (1:2000
Cell Signaling), AMPK (1:700 Proteintech), p-AMPK
(1:1000 Cell Signaling) and β-actin (1:5000 Cell Signaling).

were obtained from Shanghai Genechem Co., LTD (China):
scramble siRNA (MOCK) sense sequence 5’-CCU ACG CCA
CCA AUU UCG U-3’, antisense sequence 5’-ACG AAA
UUG GUG GCG UAG G-3’; and COX-2 siRNA : siCOX2-1
sense sequence 5’-CAG AUG AAA UAC CAG UCU U-3’,
antisense sequence 5’-AAG ACUGGU AUU UCA UCU
G-3’; siCOX2-2 sense sequence 5’-GAG GUU AAU GAA
GUA CCA A-3’,, antisense sequence 5’-UUG GUA CUU
CAU UAA CCU C-3’; and siCOX2-3 sense sequence 5’CAC CAA GAG UAU AAA CCU U-3’, antisense sequence
5’-AAG GUU UAU ACU CUU GGU G-3’. T24 cells were
plated at 80% confluence in 6-well plates and then starved
with serum deprivation for 24 h. Before transfection, diluted
5 μl lipo2000 was added into diluted siRNA, and then the mix
was added into the medium. The cells were transfected for 48
h, then lysed for western blot.
