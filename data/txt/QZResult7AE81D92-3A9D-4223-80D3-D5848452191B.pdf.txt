ABSTRACT
Significant progress has been made in the management of renal cell carcinoma
(RCC) during the last few decades. In early stage, localized disease, surgical resection
remains the modality of choice, with no therapeutic interventions as options for
post-operative therapy other than simple observation and clinical surveillance.
However, treatment options in the advanced or metastatic setting are increasing at
a dizzying pace, initially with cytokine therapy, then with the increased availability
of targeted therapy including novel small-molecule inhibitors of receptor tyrosine
kinases and monoclonal antibodies targeting novel proteins, establishing them as the
current standard of care. Even more recently, immunotherapy has seen tremendous
development in the form of immune checkpoint inhibition and vaccines. Overall, these
interventions have gradually changed the landscape of cancer management in general,
and metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) in particular. This is exemplified by the
recent United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) approval of nivolumab
for patients with mRCC after failure of TKI therapy. In this review, we present a
brief overview of the current management of mRCC, primarily the clear cell subtype
(ccRCC), and discuss the major clinical trials and data on the immunotherapy in
advanced or mRCC.

INTRODUCTION

was commonly used in the 1990’s for mRCC, though
its use has declined given modest response rates and
poor tolerability. On the other hand, immune checkpoint
inhibition has made significant progress and gained much
attention with the approval for use in various solid tumors
such as melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer and more
recently, RCC [1, 2]. In this review, we present a brief
overview of the current management of mRCC, primarily
the clear cell subtype (ccRCC), and discuss the major
clinical trials and data on the immunotherapy in advanced
or mRCC.

For decades, therapeutic modalities for cancer
management have primarily consisted of surgery,
radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In renal cell carcinoma
(RCC), surgical resection, either via nephron-sparing or
radical nephrectomy, can be curative in patients with early
stage, localized disease. However, no adjuvant treatment
has been proven to be beneficial. A significant proportion
of patients eventually develop tumor recurrence, and
subsequent therapeutic options in the advanced or
metastatic setting are limited. Since the turn of the
millennium, novel small-molecule targeted therapy has
evolved to become the mainstay of treatment for metastatic
renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), though prognosis remains
poor [1]. The past decade has seen the emergence of
immunotherapy as an exciting treatment option for various
malignancies, including RCC. The most common forms
of immunotherapy include cytokine therapy and immune
checkpoint inhibition, although vaccines are also being
investigated. Cytokine therapy such as IL-2 and IFN-α

EPIDEMIOLOGY
RCC represents 2-3% of all cancers, with the West
contributing its major share to the associated morbidity
and mortality. Worldwide, 209,000 new cases and 102,000
deaths per year are attributed to RCC [3]. RCC comprises
90% of all primary renal neoplasms and is a heterogeneous
disease that progresses along varied pathophysiological
17313

pathways. The most common subtypes are clear cell,
papillary and chromophobe, while there are at least ten
other rarer subtypes based on recent re-classification
by the International Society of Urologic Pathology [4].
RCC is known to occur predominantly in the sixth and
seventh decades of life [3]. Young adults less than 40
years of age and children are rarely affected, though they
are more likely to have symptomatic tumors [5, 6]. It is
also known to have a male predilection as compared to
females (2:1), making it the seventh most common cancer
in men while being the ninth most common cancer in
women [3]. The incidence of RCC differs among various
ethnic populations. In the United States, incidence rates
are lowest among Asian and Pacific Islanders, while being
much higher among Whites and Blacks, suggesting a
potential role for both genetic and environmental factors
[7]. The risk of developing RCC may be increased
by lifestyle-modifying factors such as smoking (both
active and passive), obesity and hypertension. It is also
more common in patients with end-stage renal disease,
acquired renal cystic disease, and tuberous sclerosis. In
addition, environmental exposures to asbestos, cadmium,
dry-cleaning solvents, gasoline and other petroleum
by-products, as well as prolonged use of non-aspirin
NSAIDs may increase the risk of developing RCC [8,
9]. Approximately 2-3% of RCC are familial, with von
Hippel-Lindau syndrome being the most common [3].

five adverse factors: low Karnofsky performance status
score (less than 80), high serum lactate dehydrogenase
level (LDH; greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of
normal), low hemoglobin level (less than the lower limit
of normal), high corrected calcium (greater than the
upper limit of normal), and short interval from diagnosis
to treatment (less than one year). In the original study,
patients with mRCC received interferon-α as first-line
therapy. Patients with none of the risk factors compared
to those with one or two and those with three or more
risk factors had significantly higher one-year (83% vs.
58% vs. 20%) and three-year overall survival (OS) rates
(45% vs. 17% vs. 2%) [13]. In the era of targeted therapy,
the International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium
(IMDC) model has been proposed. The IMDC model is
based on six adverse clinical factors, four of which are
from the MSKCC model (Karnofsky performance status,
diagnosis-to-treatment interval, hemoglobin, and corrected
calcium). In addition, neutrophils and platelets greater than
the upper limit of normal were identified as independent
adverse prognostic factors. This model was validated in
a large, multicenter study involving mRCC patients who
received sunitinib, sorafenib and bevacizumab [14].

CURRENT TARGETED THERAPY
Currently, targeted therapy involving tyrosinekinase inhibitors (TKI), especially, the anti-vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents are widely
used in the first and second line treatment for mRCC.
Prognostic risk stratification as described earlier is often
helpful in the selection of the targeted therapy. As ccRCC
represents the most common subtype of RCC, it has
been the major focus of clinical trials. In the front-line
setting, sunitinib, pazopanib and temsirolimus are the
agents most routinely used based on data from a number
of clinical trials. Sunitinib, a multikinase inhibitor, was
compared against IFN-α in the first-line setting and was
found to have improved progression-free survival (PFS)
and OS. The vast majority of the patients in the trial
were considered “favorable” or “intermediate” according
to the MSKCC prognostic model, therefore, sunitinib
is typically used in patients meeting such criteria [15,
16]. Pazopanib is another multikinase inhibitor that has
shown efficacy in the first-line setting. Pazopanib was
compared to placebo and was shown to have significantly
prolonged PFS [17]. OS was similar, but could be
explained by the extensive crossover of placebo patients
onto the pazopanib arm [18]. Pazopanib was also directly
compared with sunitinib, with pazopanib showing similar
efficacy but appeared to be better tolerated than sunitinib
[19, 20]. Meanwhile, temsirolimus, an inhibitor of the
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein, has
been investigated in “poor” risk patients. In a randomized
phase III trial, temsirolimus was evaluated as monotherapy
or in combination with IFN-α. Temsirolimus was found

PROGNOSIS
Most RCCs are clinically silent during their course
and therefore a diagnosis may not be made until they
become locally advanced or metastatic. However, in
more recent years, a significant proportion of RCCs are
also detected incidentally. The difference in prognosis
between early and advanced stage disease is striking.
In the United States, the 5-year survival (from 20052011) was 92% for localized disease, 65% for regional
disease (spread to the lymph nodes), and only 12% for
distant disease (metastases) [10]. These statistics not only
highlight the importance of developing effective therapy
in the metastatic setting, but also lead to the development
of different prognostic models to help guide treatment in
advanced RCC.
The UCLA Integrated Staging System (UISS) is a
prognostic model that incorporates information obtained
from anatomic stage (based on the 1997 tumor-nodemetastasis stage), Fuhrman’s grade, and the Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status.
Based on these criteria, patients were divided into low,
intermediate and high risk categories. This system was
validated in a prospective cohort involving RCC patients
who underwent nephrectomy [11, 12]. For recurrent or
mRCC, one of the most commonly used prognostication
systems is the one proposed by the Memorial Sloan
Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) group that integrates

to have improved PFS and OS compared to IFN-α, while
the combination did not yield additional benefit despite
an increase in adverse events [21]. Based on these data,
temsirolimus is now approved for first-line treatment of
“poor” risk metastatic RCC. Other acceptable treatment
options in the front-line setting include bevacizumab (an
anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody) in combination with
IFN-α [22, 23], sorafenib (a multikinase inhibitor) [24]
and axitinib (a multikinase inhibitor that acts by inhibiting
VEGF) [25].
For therapy in the second-line setting and beyond,
the choice of targeted agent is typically tailored based
on what the patient receive in the first-line setting.
Cabozantinib, another multikinase inhibitor, was studied
with everolimus as the control, in patients who had been
treated with prior TKI therapy, and was shown to have
improved PFS and OS [26, 27]. Axitinib can be used in
patients who received one prior systemic therapy based on
a randomized trial where it was compared with sorafenib
and was shown to have improved PFS but not OS [28,
29]. Meanwhile, lenvatinib alone and in combination with
everolimus were found to prolong PFS when compared to
everolimus alone for patients who have received one prior
anti-angiogenic therapy, with the combination recently
being approved by the United States Food and Drug
Administration (USFDA) [30]. Finally, everolimus alone
[31], sorafenib [32] and pazopanib [17] have all been
investigated in the second-line setting when compared to
placebo and demonstrated improved PFS. Other agents
that are available include sunitinib, temsirolimus and
bevacizumab.
In summary, we believe that the management of
mRCC has turned into an “embarrassment of riches”
with a multitude of options, and it is almost impossible
that a patient will be able to avail of all the options
available. Our recommendation when dealing with a
newly diagnosed mRCC patient is to first perform risk
stratification and determine prognosis. For patients with
good or intermediate risk and ccRCC, offer sunitinib
or pazopanib as these appear to have the best data, and
can be used as a single agent. For patients with poor risk
or non clear cell RCC, offer temsirolimus as front line
therapy. For patients who are intolerant to one of these
agents, offer them an alternate therapy from among the
front line agents listed above. For those patients who have
progressed on front line therapy, the preferred options are
nivolumab, cabozantinib, or the combination of lenvatinib
and everolimus, as these three options have demonstrated
a survival advantage.

nephrectomy was proposed as a modality to improve
outcomes. This was based on several reports in the
literature suggesting spontaneous regression of metastases
in patients who have undergone nephrectomy [33,
34]. While the exact mechanism is not entirely known,
immunologic factors are felt to play important role [35].
Cytoreductive nephrectomy was subsequently investigated
in two similar randomized phase III trials. In a study
conducted by the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG),
patients were randomized to receive either radical
nephrectomy followed by IFN-α-2b, or IFN-α-2b therapy
alone. OS was 11.1 months in the surgery arm compared
with 8.1 months in the interferon-only arm (P = 0.05) [36].
Meanwhile, the European Organisation for Research and
Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) similarly compared radical
nephrectomy followed by IFN-α versus IFN-α alone. OS
was significantly improved (17 months vs. 7 months)
favoring the surgery arm [37]. However, cytoreductive
nephrectomy is not without its morbidity, and careful
selection of patients should be undertaken. A retrospective
analysis identified 7 independent preoperative predictors
of inferior OS in surgical patients: a LDH level greater
than the upper limit of normal, an albumin level less
than the lower limit of normal, symptoms at presentation
caused by a metastatic site, liver metastasis, retroperitoneal
adenopathy, supradiaphragmatic adenopathy, and clinical
tumor classification ≥ T3. Patients with ≥ 4 risk factors did
not appear to benefit from surgery [38]. Finally, the role of
cytoreductive nephrectomy is not entirely clear in patients
who will undergo targeted therapy. A study published by
the International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium
demonstrated improved OS for patients who underwent
cytoreductive nephrectomy who are subsequently
treated with VEGF-targeted agents, although the benefit
is marginal in those with poor risk features [39]. A
randomized phase III trial (CARMENA) is currently
underway to investigate the importance of cytoreductive
nephrectomy in mRCC patients treated with sunitinib
[NCT00930033] [40].

IMMUNOTHERAPY
Immunotherapy is often considered a new treatment
modality in the management of cancer. However, its use
was first reported back in the late 19th century, when
surgeon William Coley demonstrated that the injection of
killed bacterial products into inoperable sarcoma tissue led
to the shrinkage of tumor [41]. He subsequently developed
a mixed bacterial vaccine and was able to achieve longterm remissions in some patients with sarcoma and various
tumor types [42, 43]. It was later recognized that cancer
cells express tumor antigens that may stimulate cellular
and/or humoral responses. Peptides derived from tumor
antigens are presented via major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) class I and class II epitopes and may
stimulate CD8+ and CD4+ T cells respectively [2].

CYTOREDUCTIVE NEPHRECTOMY
Prior to the widespread use of targeted therapy
and immunotherapy, mRCC was associated with a
dismal prognosis given the limited role of chemotherapy.
Treatment was limited to cytokine therapy. Cytoreductive

The binding of the T cell receptor (TCR) to the peptide
presented by MHC requires further co-stimulatory
signals, and its interaction activates downstream pathways
resulting in the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines
[44]. However, the amplitude and quality of the response
are regulated by a balance between co-stimulatory and
inhibitory signals, known as immune checkpoints [45].
In mRCC, various forms of immunotherapy,
including cytokines, immune checkpoint inhibitors,
vaccines, have been used or tested. The following sections
will discuss these in more detail.

responses in carefully selected patients with mRCC.
However, it has gradually fallen out of favor in the firstline setting in this current era of targeted therapy and
immunotherapy.

Checkpoint inhibition
There are a number of mechanisms through
which immune invasion by tumor cells can occur. These
mechanisms include downmodulation of tumor antigen
presentation by downregulation of MHC class I molecules,
upregulation of inhibitors of apoptosis, or expression
of cell surface molecules that directly kill cytotoxic
T cells. Tumors may also release factors that induce
inhibition of both the innate and the adaptive anti-tumor
immunity, as well as recruit regulatory cells to generate an
immunosuppressive microenvironment [50, 51]. Finally,
immune checkpoint proteins may become dysregulated,
typically via overexpression of inhibitory ligands and
receptors that regulate T cell effector functions in the
tumor microenvironment [45].
The two immune checkpoint receptors most
commonly targeted are the cytotoxic T-lymphocyteassociated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death
protein 1 (PD-1). CTLA-4 is present on the surface of T
cells and counteracts the action of co-stimulatory receptor
CD28. Both CTLA-4 and CD28 bind identical ligands
CD80 and CD86, but CTLA-4 does so at a higher affinity,
thus out competing CD28 and dampens the activation
of T cells. In addition, CTLA-4 may directly sequester
CD80 and CD86 from CD28 engagement, as well as
active removal of CD80 and CD86 from the antigenpresenting cell surface [45, 52]. CTLA-4 antibodies were
initially tested on mouse models of colon adenocarcinoma
and sarcoma and were noted to induce tumor shrinkage
[53]. These encouraging results subsequently led to the
development of two CTLA-4 antibodies, ipilimumab and
tremelimumab.
PD-1 is a transmembrane protein that is more
broadly expressed than CTLA-4. It is found in T cells,
as well as B cells and natural killer cells. It binds to
two ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are commonly
expressed on the tumor cell surface of multiple tumor
types. The interaction of PD-1 and its ligands inhibits
kinases that are involved in T cell activation, induces
anergy among antigen-specific T cells and converts
effector T cells into regulatory T cells [45, 54]. Blockade
of this interaction was subsequently evaluated and the
initial clinical trial demonstrated impressive tumor
regression in various refractory tumor types, including
RCC, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal
cancer [55].
Immune checkpoint inhibition has quickly become
a major focus of research over the past decade given its
durable response rates and promising survival benefits in
various malignancies. A number of inhibitors in the PD-1

Cytokine therapy
Prior to the development of targeted therapy,
cytokines such as IL-2 and IFN-α were used for the
management of mRCC. However, these are typically
associated with significant toxicity with mild clinical
benefit. High dose IL-2 was approved by the USFDA as
early as 1992 for the treatment of mRCC based on data
from phase II trials. Fyfe et al. reported data on 255
patients (from 7 different phase II trials) who received
high dose IL-2. The objective response rate (ORR) was
14% (5% complete response and 9% partial response).
However, treatment was associated with significant
toxicities, including grade 3 and 4 hypotension (74%),
nausea/vomiting (25%), diarrhea (22%), mental status
changes (28%), elevated bilirubin (21%), oliguria/anuria
(46%), fever/chills (24%), thrombocytopenia (21%),
though recovery was considered rapid [46]. A subsequent
retrospective analysis reviewed data from 259 mRCC
patients treated with high dose IL-2 at the National Cancer
Institute between 1986 and 2006, and confirmed a 20%
ORR. Of note, disease recurrence occurred in all patients
with partial response (PR), while 19 of 23 patients (83%)
with complete response (CR) were disease-free at the time
of last follow-up [47].
Further studies focused on determining whether
lower doses of IL-2 could produce similar efficacy with
lower toxicity. The Cytokine Working Group conducted
a randomized phase III study which compared high dose
IL-2 with the outpatient combination of IL-2 and IFN-α.
The response rate was 23.2% in the high dose IL-2
group versus 9.9% in the outpatient combination group.
No significant differences in PFS and OS were noted.
However, significant difference in OS favoring high dose
IL-2 were seen in patients with liver and bone metastases
(P = 0.001) and in patients whose primary tumors were
still in place (P = 0.040) [48]. The National Cancer
Institute designed a phase III trial comparing high-dose
IL-2 (720,000 U/kg every 8 hours) and low-dose IL-2
(72,000 U/kg every 8 hours). Toxicities were less frequent
with low-dose IL-2, but there was a higher ORR with
high-dose (21%) compared with low-dose (13%). No OS
difference was noted [49]. Based on results from these
studies, high-dose IL-2 can potentially achieve durable

In addition, there are multiple ongoing trials
investigating whether immunotherapy combinations, with
each other or with targeted therapy, can yield additional
benefit in mRCC. Chen and Mellman proposed a cancerimmunity cycle in which a series of stepwise events
are needed in order for an anticancer immune response
to lead to effective killing of cancer cells. Combining
agents that target different parts of the cycle may lead to
synergistic effects. For example, anti-CTLA-4 antibodies
enhance priming and activation of antigen-specific T
cells, while the blockade of the PD-1 pathway removes
the inhibition of cancer cell killing by T cells [59]. This
combination appears to provide clinical activity distinct
from monotherapy alone in metastatic melanoma [60].
In addition, immunotherapy in combination with agents
that enhance T cell trafficking and infiltration into the
tumor bed, such as VEGF inhibitors, may also potentially
provide additional clinical benefit not seen with either
modality alone (Figure 1) [61-63].
Checkpoint inhibitors have their limitations in
that a large proportion of patients do not respond to the
treatments. In general, tumors with a higher mutational
burden are associated with better response and durable

clinical benefit [64]. The expression of PD-L1 also appears
to correlate with elevated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
and is associated with response to monoclonal antibodies
targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway [65]. Based on these
principles, recent research have shown that increasing
effector T cells tumor infiltration may improve the efficacy
of PD-L1 checkpoint blockade [66].
As a class, checkpoint inhibitors are associated
with a range of immune-related adverse events. The most
common and typically earliest onset adverse reaction is
dermatologic toxicity, which is usually managed by topical
corticosteroid cream. Diarrhea/colitis is also common, but
has a much higher incidence with CTLA-4 antibodies
than antibodies targeting PD-1/PD-L1. Hepatotoxicity
and endocrinopathy in the form of hypophysitis and
hypothyroidism are also occasionally encountered. Other
organs that may potentially be affected include lung, eye,
kidney, pancreas, as well as neurologic or hematologic
syndromes [67].
The following section describes the various
checkpoint inhibitors that are being investigated in the
management of mRCC (Table 1).

Nivolumab

II study (KEYNOTE-029) involving pembrolizumab
plus ipilimumab or pegylated interferon alfa-2b (PEGIFN) in patients with metastatic melanoma and RCC was
recently reported [82]. There are also multiple ongoing
studies evaluating pembrolizumab in combination with
various drugs with different mechanisms [NCT02014636,
NCT02133742,
NCT02348008,
NCT02089685,
NCT02501096,
NCT02619253,
NCT02298959,
NCT02646748, NCT02178722, NCT02475213] [83-92].

Nivolumab (Opdivo®, Bristol-Myers Squibb,
Princeton, NJ) is a fully human IgG4 anti-PD-1 immune
checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibody. It has been
studied extensively in various cancers, and has received
approval by the USFDA for the treatment of mRCC, in
addition to metastatic melanoma and squamous and nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer, and more recently,
in Hodgkin Disease [68, 69].
Its initial development in renal cancer was as a phase
II trial involving previously treated metastatic ccRCC
patients. Nivolumab was dosed at 0.3, 2 and 10 mg/kg
every 3 weeks, and was noted to produce ORR in 20-22%
of patients with an OS of 18.2-25.5 months [70]. Given the
promising data in this phase II study, a randomized, openlabel, phase III study was developed comparing nivolumab
to everolimus in patients who received prior treatment
(Check Mate 025). 821 patients were randomly assigned
1:1 to receive either nivolumab 3 mg/kg intravenously
every 2 weeks or everolimus 10 mg orally every day. The
median OS were 25.0 months (95% confidence interval
(CI), 21.8-not estimable) in the nivolumab group and
19.6 months (95% CI, 17.6-23.1), with the hazard ratio
(HR) for death of 0.73 (98.5% CI, 0.57-0.93; P = 0.002)
favoring the nivolumab group. The objective response
rates also favored the nivolumab group (25% vs. 5%; P <
0.001), though the median PFS were similar (4.6 months
vs. 4.4 months; HR 0.88; P = 0.11). The authors postulated
that there might be a potential delayed benefit in PFS with
nivolumab based on the late separation of the PFS curves
and that PFS was not a surrogate for OS in this study. A
benefit was observed with nivolumab irrespective of PDL1 expression. Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse
events were less in the nivolumab group (19%) compared
with the everolimus group (37%). Given improvement
in efficacy and fewer treatment-related side effects
compared to everolimus, nivolumab was established as
a new standard of care in the management of advanced
clear cell RCC in the second-line setting [58]. Nivolumab
is under investigation as pre- and post-operative therapy
in metastatic RCC (ADAPTeR) [NCT02446860] [71]
and is also being studied in combination with other
drugs [NCT01472081, NCT02231749, NCT02210117,
NCT02335918, NCT02614456] [72-76].

Atezolizumab
Atezolizumab is a fully humanized monoclonal
IgG1 antibody that targets PD-L1. It is being evaluated in
multiple different cancers, including RCC. A recent phase
Ia study involving atezolizumab in mRCC was recently
reported. Of the 63 patients with clear cell RCC that were
evaluable, median PFS was 5.6 months and median OS
was 28.9 months. The objective response rate was 15%
(18% in patients with > 1%, and 9% in those with < 1%
PD-L1 expression) [93]. Several other trials involving
atezolizumab are currently underway [NCT01984242,
NCT02420821, NCT02543645, NCT02655822] [94-97].

Avelumab
Avelumab (MSB0010718C) is a fully human
anti-PD-L1 IgG1 monoclonal antibody that works by
inhibiting PD-1/PD-L1 interactions while leaving PD-1/
PD-L2 pathway intact. It may also induce antibodydependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) by retaining
a native Fc region. In a phase Ib study, avelumab was
used in patients with refractory solid tumors and showed
similar toxicity profiles compared to other PD-1 or PDL1 inhibitors [98]. Two ongoing trials are evaluating
avelumab in combination with axitinib [NCT02493751,
NCT02684006] [99, 100].

Durvalumab
Durvalumab (MEDI4736) is another human antiPD-L1 IgG1 monoclonal antibody. It blocks PD-L1
binding to PD-1 and CD80, with no binding to PD-L2.
ADCC and complement-dependent cytotoxicities are
removed by an engineered triple mutation in the Fc
domain. A Phase 1/2, multicenter, open-label study which
evaluated the safety and clinical activity of the drug in
patients with multiple solid tumor types such as non-small
cell lung cancer noted very manageable safety profile
[101]. There are ongoing trials evaluating durvalumab in
combination with other drugs, including tremelimumab
(a fully human monoclonal antibody against CTLA4) [NCT01975831] [102] and MEDI0680 (AMP-514)
(a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody against PD-

Pembrolizumab
Pembrolizumab (Keytruda®, Merck, Whitehouse
Station, NJ) is a highly selective humanized IgG4
antibody that targets the PD-1 receptor and USFDA
approved metastatic melanoma, squamous and nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer, and head and neck
cancer [81]. It is currently being investigated for use in
mRCC. Preliminary safety data from a recent phase I/

malignancies including RCC.

IMA-901 is a vaccine developed from multiple
tumor-associated peptides (TUMAP) that are naturally
presented in human cancer tissue. In a phase II trial
utilizing the co-administration of cyclophosphamide
(which reduces the inhibitory regulatory T cells), IMA-901
demonstrated a disease control rate of 31% at 6 months in
patients previously treated with cytokine therapy, and 14%
at 6 months in patients previously treated with tyrosine
kinase inhibitors [107]. In a separate phase III trial, 339
patients were randomly assigned to receive sunitinib
or to sunitinib plus IMA901 and GM-CSF. OS was not
improved with the addition of the IMA901 vaccine
compared with sunitinib alone [108].
TroVax (MVA-5T4) is a therapeutic vaccine
targeting a glycosylated 5T4 antigen expressed on human
placental trophoblasts and various human cancer cells.
This particular tumor-associated antigen is overexpressed
in most RCCs [109]. In a phase III TRIST trial, MVA-5T4
in combination with IFN-α, IL-2 or sunitinib as first-line
mRCC therapy did not result in a significant increase in
OS when compared to the arm without MVA-5T4 [110].
There are other ongoing trials involving DC-based
vaccines. Some of the promising ones involve transduction
of a fusion gene construct of GM-CSF and carbonic
anhydrase IX into autologous DCs [NCT01826877]
[111], pidilizumab (a PD-1 antibody) in combination
with DC/RCC fusion cells [NCT01441765] [112], and
DCs in combination with cytokine-induced killer cells
[NCT00862303] [113].

Ipilimumab
Ipilimumab (Yervoy®, Bristol-Myers Squibb,
Princeton, NJ) is an anti-CTLA-4 IgG1 monoclonal
antibody that is USFDA approved in melanoma
[104]. It has been investigated as a single agent and in
combination with nivolumab in metastatic melanoma,
with the combination shown to be more effective albeit
with significantly more toxicity [77]. This combination of
nivolumab and ipilimumab is currently being investigated
in mRCC. In a phase I study, patients were randomized
into 2 groups with different dosing combinations followed
by maintenance nivolumab until disease progression
or unacceptable toxicity. Objective responses were
noted in 15 of 44 patients (34%) and stable disease
was seen in another 16 patients (36%) [78]. Further
trials investigating ipilimumab alone [NCT00057889]
[79] and in combination with other drugs are ongoing
[NCT02231749, NCT02381314] [73, 80].

Tremelimumab
Tremelimumab is another anti-CTLA-4 antibody
that is actively being investigated in mRCC. Unlike
ipilimumab, it is an IgG2 antibody. As discussed
previously, it is currently being evaluated with durvalumab
in the treatment of patients with mRCC [NCT01975831]
[102].

Adjuvant immunotherapy
Given the success and promising data involving
checkpoint inhibition in metastatic RCC, it is reasonable
to ask the question whether immunotherapy plays a role
in the non-metastatic adjuvant setting. However, various
randomized trials of adjuvant therapy involving tumor
cells plus BCG, tumor cell vaccination, IFN-α, high-dose
IL-2, or a combination of cytokines have not demonstrated
survival benefit when compared with observation [114].
The role of checkpoint inhibition has not been investigated
in the adjuvant setting. Therefore, at this time, observation
is still the recommended approach in stage I-III RCC
following nephrectomy.

Vaccines
Vaccines are also under active investigation
in RCC. They are aimed at treatment of the primary
tumor rather than prevention, and uses the patient’s
tumor cells or tumor-associated products for immune
recognition. Clinical trials evaluating various vaccines
have been conducted, although none has demonstrated
an improvement in survival thus far. AGS-003 is a
dendritic cell (DC) based vaccine in which mature DCs
are co-electroporated with amplified tumor mRNA and
synthetic CD40L RNA. CD40L expression on the DC
surface is thought to cause T-cell activation by inducing
co-stimulatory signals. A phase II study on 21 intermediate
or poor-risk mRCC patients eligible for nephrectomy
were treated by a combination therapy of AGS-003 with
sunitinib. Median PFS and OS were 11.2 and 30.2 months
respectively [105]. Based on these results, a phase III
ADAPT study is currently underway, in which mRCC
patients undergoing debulking nephrectomy are randomly
assigned to sunitinib alone or sunitinib plus AGS-003
[NCT01582672] [106].

radiotherapy

RCC is often considered to be a radio-resistant
disease and the role of radiation is generally limited to
palliative or local control. Preclinical data from the
1990’s from a RCC mouse model demonstrated the
regression of lung metastases with radiation and an even
greater degree of decrease when combined with IL-2
[115]. In addition, over the past decade, there is growing
17320

Oncotarget

evidence that stereotactic radiotherapy may overcome
resistance, although currently no randomized clinical
trials have been done. Although the exact mechanism is
not known, one hypothesis is that when radiotherapy is
applied in a high-dose, few-fraction schedule, dendritic
cells are recruited to the irradiated site, which adopt the
tumor antigens and presented to cytotoxic T lymphocytes
in the lymph nodes [116]. Currently, there is an ongoing
clinical trial evaluating radiation therapy in combination
with pembrolizumab for patients with recurrent or mRCC
[NCT02318771] [117].

a predictive biomarker [58]. One of the criticisms has
been that the tumor samples that are being evaluated
are derived from primary site and in the treatment naive
setting, which are bound to be immunologically different
from cancer samples that have already been exposed
to prior therapies. Furthermore, while the knowledge
derived from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) effort is
likely to provide a lot more insight into the biology of
the tumors, it underperforms on the immunotherapy front,
since the major host immune response lies in the stromal
cells, which was not part of the TCGA evaluation. Other
potential biomarkers include the preexistence of CD8+
tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), though these have
been directly associated with anti PD-1 therapy only in
melanoma and MSI high colorectal cancer [118, 119]. This
needs to be explored further in renal cancer.
In this review, we have sought to highlight the entire
field of clinical development of immune based therapy for
mRCC, and hope that the reader will find this piece of
work useful as a summary and as a source of reference.
We also recognize that it is a highly dynamic and evolving
field, and the pace of development is astounding and
encouraging. The use of immune based therapy for this
disease, while decades old (in the form of INF and IL-2),
offers new promise with the targeting of the checkpoint
pathways. The latter field is still in its infancy stage, with
tremendous potential for the future. We believe that a
major paradigm shift in RCC management will only occur
once we can increase the cure rates of surgically managed
patients by finding a drug that will improve survival rates
in the adjuvant setting. Such trials using TKI and anti
PD-1/PD-L1 agents are in progress, and the results are
eagerly awaited.

CONCLUSION
The role of immunotherapy in the management
of RCC has changed dramatically since the turn of the
century. Previously, cytokine therapy involving IL-2 and
IFN-α was the mainstay of mRCC treatment. However,
benefit was only marginal considering the toxicities
related to therapy. Over the past decade, significant
progress has been made in the development of new
immunotherapeutic agents in the form of checkpoint
inhibition and vaccines, and these agents are gradually
being incorporated in the treatment of mRCC and many
other cancers, such as melanoma, non-small cell lung
cancer, Hodgkin’s disease, and head and neck cancer. In
mRCC, various checkpoint inhibitors are currently being
investigated for use as a first-line agent, following recent
USFDA approval of nivolumab in the second-line setting.
As the use of immunotherapy becomes more widespread
in oncology, many questions will certainly need to be
addressed. For example, the long-term side effects and
resistance mechanisms of these drugs in various tumors
are important considerations. Optimizing treatment
dose and schedule, investigating biomarkers that may
affect disease outcomes, and evaluating the combination
of different treatment modalities are also critical in
maximizing the potential of immunotherapy [67]. Further
research and experience in this field will allow us to better
identify strategies in utilizing immunotherapeutic agents
not just in RCC, but also in many other malignancies.
It is now quite clear that immunotherapy is here
to stay and has begun to impact the clinical outcome of
patients with mRCC. Further enhancements to this efficacy
paradigm can be achieved with the use of combination
therapies, including with other checkpoint inhibitors
and with anti-VEGF TKI. As alluded to earlier in this
review, there is strong pre-clinical rationale for combining
immunotherapy with anti-VEGF inhibitors. The latter, in
particular, have been shown to reduce myeloid derived
stem cells (MDSC) that are crucial in tumor-induced
immune suppression. Furthermore, development and
clinical implementation of predictive biomarkers will
be crucial to the use of immunotherapy. Preliminary
research, especially the expression of PD-L1 by IHC in
the tumor cells, has so far not lived up to the promise of
