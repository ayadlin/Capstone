BACKGROUND. Efficacy and toxicity of oxaliplatin (Eloxatin; Sanofi-Aventis, Paris,
France) combined with irinotecan (IROX) were examined in 383 patients enrolled
on the IROX arm of Intergroup Study N9741.
METHODS. This IROX regimen was oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 and irinotecan 200 mg/
m2 administered every 3 weeks. The relation between adverse events on IROX to
selected characteristics was analyzed. Time to progression (TTP), response rate,
and overall survival for patients treated with IROX compared with patients treated with oxaliplatin with 5- fluorouracil (FOLFOX) were updated in this article.

RESULTS. Grade 3 gastrointestinal and hematologic toxicities were common
with 39% patients experiencing neutropenia, 28% diarrhea, and 21% vomiting.
Patients ages >70 years experienced higher rates of grade 3 toxicity, with significantly higher rates of grade 3 hematologic toxicities (P 5 .02). Long-term toxicity was uncommon, and nearly all cases of grade 3 neurotoxicity resolved

adverse events, and 26% experienced 119 hospitalizations related to complicaconfirmed prior findings that FOLFOX is superior to IROX in terms of response
rate (43% vs 36%, p 5 0.002), TTP (9.2 months vs 6.7 months, P < .0001), and
overall survival (19.5 months vs 17.3 months, P 5 .0001).
CONCLUSIONS. IROX was found to be less active than FOLFOX but with a similar
toxicity profile except in patients ages >70 years. Although IROX may be considered in patients intolerant of 5-FU or in patients known to have a dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency, it should be used with caution in older
patients. Cancer 2007;110:670–7.  2007 American Cancer Society.

n estimated 145,000 new cases and 56,000 deaths were due to
colorectal cancer in the United States in 2006.1 For many years,
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with leucovorin (LV) was the only treatment
option for patients with metastatic colorectal disease. In the last decade, 2 new cytotoxic agents, oxaliplatin (Eloxatin; Sanofi-Aventis,
Paris, France) and irinotecan, have been approved by the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of metastatic colorectal

cancer. Whereas irinotecan is effective either as a single agent or in combination, oxaliplatin has the most
activity when used in combination. Although there is
a large body of literature on the use of irinotecan and
oxaliplatin in combination with 5-FU, there is limited
data on the combination of irinotecan and oxaliplatin
without 5-FU. Recent data have also been presented
on the use of 5-FU with oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) and irinotecan used in combination (known as FOLFOXIRI).2
The North American Intergroup phase 3 trial
N9741 compared 3 chemotherapy regimens for treatment of previously untreated metastatic colorectal
cancer. Over the course of the study, patients were
randomly assigned to treatment on 1 of 6 treatment
arms that used combinations of 5-FU combined with
leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin. The results of
this study have been previously reported.3,4 In this
report, we detail the experience of the 383 patients
who received combined oxaliplatin and irinotecan
(IROX).
Irinotecan and oxaliplatin have different mechanisms of action. Irinotecan is a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor and oxaliplatin is a platinum-based drug that
blocks DNA replication.5 Preclinical data confirmed
their synergism, and phase 1 and phase 2 trials established that IROX had activity similar to that observed
with other 2-drug combinations in metastatic colorectal cancer. Neutropenia and diarrhea were dose-limiting toxicities.6,7
The primary publication of N9741 presented data
on the first 256 IROX-treated patients and established
that combination chemotherapy that used oxaliplatin
with 5- fluorouracil (FOLFOX) had a higher response
rate (RR), time to progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS) than IROX or irinotecan þ bolus 5-FU þ
leucovorin (IFL).3 The restricted cohort in the primary
report was precipitated by the dose reduction on IFL
that occurred as the study was in progress; only those
patients randomly assigned to the trial while IFL was
at full dose was included in that report. This analysis
presents updated efficacy and toxicity data for all 383
patients treated with IROX in N9741.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Goals
The goal of N9741 was to compare time to progression in patients with locally advanced or metastatic
colorectal cancer (previously untreated for advanced
disease) who received FOLFOX (oxaliplatin þ 5-FU
þ leucovorin) or IROX (irinotecan þ oxaliplatin) (the
experimental regimens), to the control regimen, IFL.

This report focuses on the activity and toxicities
associated with IROX.

Patient Selection and Treatment
N9741 was approved by the institutional review
boards of all study participants, and written informed consent was obtained from patients. Primary
funding was provided through the National Cancer
Institute; Pharmacia (now Pfizer) provided support
for translational elements of the protocol, and subsequent to study completion, Sanofi-Synthelabo (now
Sanofi-Aventis) supported work related to supplemental New Drug Application filing for oxaliplatin.
Both irinotecan and oxaliplatin for the IROX treated
cohort were provided free of charge to patients.
N9741 eligibility criteria are listed in the primary
report.3 Patients in the IROX arm were treated with
oxaliplatin 85mg/m2 and irinotecan 200 mg/m2 once
every 3 weeks. Treatment continued until disease
progression, unmanageable toxic effects, or withdrawal of consent.
Patient Assessment and Treatment
Patients required a physical examination and laboratory tests, including complete blood count with
differential, serum liver function tests, creatinine
clearance, electrocardiography, and prothrombin
time (for patients on warfarin) within 14 days before
registration. Chest radiography and disease imaging
were required within 30 days before registration.
Complete blood counts were monitored weekly, and
physical examination and laboratory testing were
performed before each 3-week cycle. Tumors were
measured every 6 weeks for the first 42 weeks or
until response was confirmed. Measurements were
every 12 weeks thereafter.
Patients were randomly assigned to each treatment arm, and arms were balanced with respect to
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance
status (PS) (0–1 vs 2), whether patients had received
previous adjuvant chemotherapy or immunotherapy,
age (<65 years vs 65 years), and location of randomization.
Toxicity (except paresthesia) was graded by using
the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 2.0. Paresthesias that interfered with
daily activities or resulted in disability were graded
as 3 or 4, respectively. Dose reductions of 20% were
mandated after development of grade 3 or 4 toxicity,
and persistent grade 2 toxicity resulted in treatment
delay until resolution. If toxicity did not resolve to
grade 1 after 2 weeks or after 2 or more dose
reductions, therapy was discontinued. Growth factor

TABLE 1
Baseline Characteristics
IROX

Disease Assessment
Enrollment required at least 1 measurable lesion
2 cm in diameter or assessable disease. Complete
response was defined as disappearance of all baseline disease and absence of new lesions. Partial
response was defined as regression of tumor burden
to where the sum of the products of the largest perpendicular tumor dimensions was reduced by 50%.
Progression was defined as an increase of 25% in
tumor burden, or an increase in tumor size in
patients without measurable disease, or appearance
of new lesions. Stabilization was defined as changes
in assessment that did not fulfill the definitions of
either response or progression. Time to progression
was defined as the date of study entry to the date
of disease progression, and survival was defined by
the interval between enrollment and death or last
contact.
Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint of N9741 was time to progression, and the main secondary endpoint was overall
survival, and response rate was a secondary endpoint. The protocol-specified enrollment of 375
patients per arm afforded 90% statistical power to
detect a hazard ratio of 0.75 between each experimental regimen and control.
The Kaplan-Meier method was used to describe
the distribution of time to progression, overall survival, and time to treatment discontinuation. Cox
proportional hazards modeling was used to calculate
hazard ratios and confidence intervals. Chi-square
tests and Fisher exact tests were used to compare
toxicity and response rate by arm. All randomly
assigned patients were included for efficacy analyses
according to intention-to-treat principles; patients
who canceled before treatment initiation were
excluded from toxicity analyses. Statistical significance was determined at P < .05.
In this retrospective analysis of all patients enrolled to the IROX arm of N9741, likelihood of serious toxicity was tested for association with age, sex,
performance stats, race, and with number of cycles
received using chi-square tests and logistic regression. On the basis of recent analysis in colon cancer,
we choose age <70 years versus 70 years as an age
cutpoint.8,9 Frequency and reason for dose reductions were recorded as were frequency, cause and
timing of treatment-related and other hospitalizations, and long-term toxicity. Reasons for discontinu-

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Three hundred eighty-three patients (153 women
and 230 men) were randomly assigned to IROX.
Their mean age was 60 years (range, 26 years to
85 years), baseline performance status was 0–1 in
363 (95%) patients, and baseline performance status
was 2 in 20 (5%) patients, and 86% of patients had
received no prior chemotherapy (Table 1). These
characteristics were well balanced by patient age
(<70 years vs 70 years).
Three patients were canceled before treatment,
and 5 patients were found to be ineligible after being
randomly selected. There were 2 major violations,
both occurred when patients were randomly assigned
to IROX but received a different regimen.
Toxicity
The average number of IROX cycles delivered was 7.7
(range, 1 to 41 cycles). One hundred ninety-eight

(52.1%) patients required 354 dose reductions. Reasons for dose reductions included neutropenia
37.9%, diarrhea 22.9%, sensory neuropathy 10.5%,
neutropenic fever 5.1%, nausea 2.5%, thrombocytopenia 2.0%, vomiting 1.7%, and other 17%. The most
frequent grade 3toxicities were neutropenia 39.2%,
diarrhea 28.2%, vomiting 21.6%, nausea 20.5%, febrile
neutropenia 10.5%, abdominal pain 8.4%, neurotoxicity
7.1%, dehydration 6.6%, anemia 3.2%, pharyngeallaryngeal dysesthesias 0.8%, constipation 3.4%, and
stomatitis 0.5% (Table 2).
Neurotoxicity grade 3 occurred in 7.1% of IROX
patients. The median number of cycles delivered at
the time of onset of grade 3 neurotoxicity was 7,
with a median cumulative dose of 878 mg/m2 of oxaliplatin. The frequency of pharyngeal-laryngeal dysesthesias increased over the first 3 cycles, from 37
cases in Cycle 1 to 52 cases in Cycle 3. Fewer
patients noted the first onset of this symptom after
Cycle 3. All occurrences were grade 3.
Among patients >70 years of age, the rate of
grade 3 neutropenia (P 5 .0013), febrile neutropenia (P 5 .03), and any hematologic toxicity significantly exceeded that of those ages <70 (59% age
70; 73% age >70, P 5 .0004; Table 3); age was not
significantly related to severe nonhematologic toxicity (P 5 .19). Nonsignificant trends for increased neurotoxicity and decreased abdominal pain and vomiting
in the elderly were observed. These relations remained
consistent in a multivariate model after statistical
adjustments were made for sex, performance status,
and race.

Of 383 patients receiving IROX, 100 patients
experienced 119 treatment-related hospitalizations.
The majority of these events occurred in Cycle 1
(47.9%) and Cycle 2 (17.6%). This resulted in an overall risk of hospitalization of 15.1% during Cycle 1,
5.6% during Cycle 2, and a total risk of hospitalization during treatment of 26.1%. Hospitalization rates
were not significantly increased in patients ages >70
years (35%) compared with those ages 70 years
(24%) (P 5 .078). Reasons for hospitalization were
primarily gastrointestinal side effects and neutropenia (Table 4). Forty-one additional hospital admissions deemed unrelated to treatment were primarily
for episodes of bowel obstruction.
Reasons for treatment discontinuation included
disease progression in 55.0%, adverse events in
18.0%, refusal of further treatment in 10.9%, other in
9.3%, alternate treatment 3.2%, death on study 1.9%,
and other medical problems 1.9%.
Eleven patients reported long-term toxicity after
treatment cessation. These included 7 patients with
neuropathy, 5 with resolution within 2–4 months. One
additional patient reported that symptoms were
resolved within 10 months, and 1 patient had ongoing
symptoms at 10 months. One patient each with gastrointestinal dysfunction, injection site inflammation, and fatigue had symptom resolution within 2
months, and 1 patient experienced ongoing renal
dysfunction.
Five patients died from treatment-related complications—3 from sepsis (2 involving peritonitis following bowel perforation), 1 from dehydration and

Cycles 1 and 2, and 1 in Cycle 3. Two patients who
died during Cycles 2 and 3 had required hospital
admission during Cycle 1 for toxicity. Two deaths on
treatment were deemed unrelated, 1 each from West
Nile virus infection, and another patient experienced
gastrointestinal bleeding. There was a trend for an
association between age and risk for treatmentrelated mortality when comparing patients ages

Outcome
Three hundred seventy-nine patients were evaluable
for response, and 383 patients were evaluable for
survival. At reported median follow-up on living
patients of 38 months, 90.3% of patients had disease
progression. The confirmed response rate was 36.4%,
and time to progression was 6.7 months (95% CI,
6 months to 7.4 months). Based on this updated
analysis, the overall survival benefit for FOLFOX
compared with IROX is now statistically significant.
IROX 1-year and 3-year survival rates were 65% and
12%, with a median overall survival of 17.3 months
(95% CI, 16.1 months to 19.2 months). Figures 1 and
2 show updated time to progression and overall survival for IROX with comparison to the 386 patients
concurrently randomized to FOLFOX.
The updated efficacy outcomes on all 383
patients are almost identical to results obtained in
the initial analysis of the first 265 patients enrolled
on the IROX arm in N9741 (previously reported:
response rate of 35%, time to progression of
6.5 months, and overall survival of 17.4 months). The
updated results, including all patients with longer
follow-up, continue to demonstrate that IROX is
not as effective a regimen compared with FOLFOX
(Table 5).

DISCUSSION
The abundance of both new chemotherapeutic and
biologic agents for colorectal cancer has led investigators to explore various treatment combinations. To
our knowledge, this is the largest published phase 3
trial to examine IROX treatment. This updated series
demonstrates that IROX is an active but moderately
toxic regimen. The most frequent and serious toxicities were hematologic (neutropenia [39.2%] and
febrile neutropenia [10.5%]) and gastrointestinal,
including diarrhea (28.2%), vomiting (21.6%), nausea
(20.5%), and dehydration (6.6%). Altogether, 52.1% of
patients required dose reductions, primarily for neutropenia (37.9%) and diarrhea (22.9%), indicating
that reduced initial doses of IROX should be considered. Given the frequency of gastrointestinal toxicity
encountered and its contribution to hospitalization,
careful patient monitoring and education concerning
its management needs to be undertaken when using
IROX. If patients encountered toxicities requiring dose
modification, irinotecan was reduced to 160 mg/m2,
and oxaliplatin was reduced to 65 mg/m2.
IROX should be used with caution in patients
older than the age of 70 years, with consideration of
an early dose reduction at the first sign of moderate

toxicity. Also, given the high rate of grade 3þ febrile
neutropenia in the 70þ group (17%), clinicians may
want to consider the use of prophylactic growth factor support in this population.
In the future, genotyping of the UGT1A1 gene,
necessary for irinotecan metabolism, may enable some
toxicity to be avoided by alternative drug selection or
judicious dose adjustment. In this trial, preliminary
analysis of UGT1A1 polymorphisms demonstrated a
significantly higher rate of grade 4 neutropenia in
patients with the 7/7 phenotype versus those with the
6/6 phenotype (P 5 .004).10 Appropriate doses of irinotecan based on UGT1A1 tests have not yet been established.
Neurotoxicity grade 3 was found in a similar
percentage of IROX patients in this expanded analysis, 7.1%, compared with 7.0% originally reported.3
Neurotoxicity was generally reversible, with only 1
patient having ongoing symptoms 10 months beyond
treatment cessation.
Hospitalization due to toxicity was frequent, particularly during Cycles 1 and 2. This may also indicate the need for reduced initial doses of IROX. The
high risk of hospitalization during treatment (26.1%)
is important considering IROX is likely to be used in
the palliative setting and would have an impact on
patients’ quality of life.
Ages >70 years proved to be a risk factor for a
significant increase in grade 3 or greater hematologic
toxicity. Nonhematologic toxicities were noteworthy
for a nonsignificant increase in diarrhea and neurotoxicity. These trends persisted in a multivariate analysis. A trend was also present for increased
hospitalization and treatment-related mortality in
those aged older than 70 years. In addition, the 2
treatment-related deaths in those younger than the
age of 70 years were in patients aged 66 and 68 years.
All died during the first 3 cycles of treatment, with 2
of these patients requiring admission to hospital due
to toxicity in cycles prior to their deaths. These

patients all began treatment with an initial performance status of 0–1. IROX should, thus, be used cautiously in elderly patients, with careful monitoring
and early intervention for toxicity. Elderly patients
requiring hospital admission due to toxicity need
careful monitoring and dose reductions for future
treatments. Lower initial doses may also be more
appropriate in the elderly.
Literature suggests that the toxicity profile of
most chemotherapy regimens used to treat colorectal
cancer is not affected by age, with some exceptions.11 Kohne et al. and Andre et al. found similar
toxicity of 5-FU in the advanced-disease setting in all
age groups, and they concluded that age alone was
not a sufficient reason to reduce doses of 5-FU or
other cytotoxic drugs in patients with colorectal cancer.12,8 Similarly, a pooled analysis of 7 phase 3 randomized adjuvant trials involving 3351 patients
treated with combined 5-FU and leucovorin or combined 5-FU and levamisole by Sargent et al. found
no increase in toxic effects among the elderly (ages
>70 years) except for leucopenia in 1 study.9
Traditionally, there is a greater concern when
using CPT-11 therapy in elderly patients. A phase 2
study that examined 166 patients aged up to 84 years
and treated with irinotecan found patients ages
65 years were twice as likely, 38.6% vs 18.8%, to
develop grade 3–4 diarrhea compared with younger
patients.13 In contrast, a study by Chau et al. examined outcomes of 339 patients treated with secondline irinotecan monotherapy at a 3-weekly dose of 350
mg/m2 irrespective of age and found no differences in
toxicity for those younger than 70 years of age versus
those ages 70 years.14 The adverse event profile of
FOLFOX in the elderly has been recently reported by
Goldberg et al., who, on the basis of a pooled analysis
of 3742 patients, found modestly higher rates of hematologic toxicity but not other adverse events with
FOLFOX in older versus younger patients.15
There remain limited phase 3 data on IROX. Subsequent to N9741, there have been 2 phase 3 studies
reported as abstracts but as yet unpublished in
manuscript form. The first compared IROX with irinotecan monotherapy and used the same doses of
IROX as in N9741. Six hundred twenty-eight patients
with metastatic colorectal cancer with progression
on first-line fluoropyrimidine therapy, or within
6 months of adjuvant therapy were randomly selected.
The median number of IROX cycles received was 6.
The response rate of IROX compared with irinotecan
was 23.1% versus 7.3% (P < .0001); time to progression, 5.3 months versus 2.8 months (P < .0001); and
median survival 13.4 months versus 11.1 months
(P 5 .0072). No significant differences in gastrointes-

tinal or hematologic toxicities between study arms
were reported, and only 1% of IROX patients developed grade 3 neurotoxicity.16 This experience compares less favorably with outcomes obtained in our
study, likely because of prior 5-FU exposure and a
less favorable patient population.
A phase 3 trial of IROX in the first-line treatment
of metastatic colorectal patients has also been presented in abstract form. Patients were randomly
assigned to infusional 5-FU þ irinotecan (FOLFIRI)
or IROX. IROX patients were treated with oxaliplatin
85 mg/m2 (Days 1, 15, and 29) and irinotecan
80 mg/m2 weekly for 6 weeks, with cycles repeated
on Day 50. In 478 (238 in IROX arm) patients, overall
response rate of FOLFIRI compared with IROX
was 44.6% versus 47.8%; progression-free survival,
8.9 months versus 7.3 months; and overall survival,
21.9 versus 19.3 months; none of which differed significantly.17 These results were somewhat more promising than those obtained in the IROX arm in
N9741, although the regimens were different.
N9741 demonstrated that FOLFOX is superior to
IROX both in efficacy and reduced toxicity in firstline treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, and
this updated analysis confirms the original conclusions of N9741. IROX may be appropriate in patients
unable to receive FOLFOX because of contraindications to 5-FU, such as cardiotoxicity or dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency. IROX may also be
useful in second-line treatment of malignancies,
such as gastric cancer in which phase 2 data suggests
response rates as high as 50%.18 This study has
demonstrated that although IROX is an effective therapy, toxicity needs to be closely monitored particularly
during the first 2 cycles of therapy and in the elderly to
minimize toxicity from this palliative regimen.
