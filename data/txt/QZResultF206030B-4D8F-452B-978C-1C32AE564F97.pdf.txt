Abstract
NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In recent years considerable progress has been made in treatment strategies for chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, the disease remains incurable because of the development
of chemoresistance. Strategies to overcome resistance mechanisms are therefore highly needed. At
least two mechanisms contribute to the development of resistance to drugs; acquired mutations
resulting in a dysfunctional p53 response and shifts in the balance between apoptosis-regulating
proteins. Platinum-based compounds have been successfully applied in relapsed lymphoma and
recently also in high-risk CLL. In this study we investigated the efficacy and mechanism of action
of cisplatinum (CDDP) in chemorefractory CLL. Independent of p53-functional status, CDDP
acted synergistically with fludarabine (F-ara-A). The response involved generation of reactive
oxygen species (ROS), which led to specific upregulation of the proapoptotic BH3-only protein
Noxa. Induction of Noxa resulted in cell death by apoptosis as inhibition of caspase activation
completely abrogated cell death. Furthermore, drug-resistance upon CD40-ligand stimulation, a
model for the protective stimuli provided in lymph nodes, could also be overcome by CDDP/Fara-A. ROS accumulation resulted in Noxa upregulation mainly at the transcriptional level and
this was, at least in part, mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38. Finally, Noxa
RNA-interference markedly decreased sensitivity to CDDP/F-ara-A, supporting a key role for
Noxa as mediator between ROS signaling and apoptosis induction. Our data indicate that
interference in the cellular redox balance can be exploited to overcome chemoresistance in CLL.

Introduction
NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The clinical course of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is highly variable; however,
most patients eventually develop symptomatic disease requiring treatment. Although
important advances have been made in first and second line treatment strategies, cures are
not attained. Various biological markers correlate with poor prognosis and response to
treatment, such as IgVH mutational status, expression levels of CD38 and/or ZAP-70 and
cytogenetic abnormalities (reviewed by Van Bockstaele et al., 2009). Especially deletion or
mutation of the p53 locus (17p13) is associated with a very poor outcome (Zenz et al.,
2008). Most drugs, including alkylating agents and nucleoside analogs, rely on intact p53
function for their activity, and treatment with these compounds results in selection and
evolution of clones containing cytogenetic changes affecting the p53 response (Rosenwald
et al., 2004). A second important contribution to chemoresistance in CLL is made by shifts
in the balance between pro- and antiapoptotic proteins. Increased expression levels of Bcl-2
family members like Bfl-1/A1 (Morales et al., 2005) and in particular Mcl-1 (Pepper et al.,
2008) have been associated with resistance to chemotherapy. Shifts in the apoptotic balance
presumably arise in CLL cells residing in secondary lymphoid tissue. In these niches, cells
receive stimuli from the microenvironment inhibiting apoptosis, and are consequently
protected from the action of cytotoxic drugs (Munk Pedersen and Reed, 2004). Indeed, we
found increased expression of Mcl-1, Bcl-xL and Bfl-1/A1 in lymphoid tissue-derived
leukemia cells in comparison with peripheral blood-derived CLL cells (Smit et al., 2007). It
is postulated that clones harboring acquired mutations originate from these niches (Munk
Pedersen and Reed, 2004).
The prognosis for patients with fludarabine (F-ara-A) refractory disease is extremely poor,
with a median survival of less than a year (Seymour et al., 1995). Therefore, it is highly
necessary to develop therapeutic strategies that circumvent resistance mechanisms to
cytotoxic agents to obtain sustained responses in these patients.
Several novel drugs are currently under investigation in clinical and preclinical studies for
this category of patients (reviewed by Kater and Tonino, 2010), but although responses have
been observed, when used as single agent these drugs generally do not induce long-term
disease-free survival.

An approach to overcome drug resistance could be to alter the cellular apoptotic balance,
independent of p53, to sensitize cells to alkylating agents and nucleoside analogs. Regimens
containing platinum-based compounds have shown activity in CLL, importantly also in p53dysfunctional cases. In a small phase I-II trial, the oxaliplatin, F-ara-A, cytarabine and
rituximab (OFAR) regimen induced a response in 7 of 20 patients with a documented 17p
deletion (Tsimberidou et al., 2008). We recently found marked activity of the rituximab,
dexamethasone, cytarabine and cisplatinum (CDDP) (R-DHAP) regimen in 8 of 10 patients
with F-ara-A refractory disease, including patients with proven p53 dysfunction (Tonino et
al., 2010). Synergy between F-ara-A and platinum-based compounds was studied in in vitro
studies and was found to result from inhibition of nucleotide excision repair by F-ara-A of
DNA damage induced by platinum-based compounds in both a cell-free system and in CLL
cells derived from patients with early-stage disease (in which p53 dysfunction is found in

less than 5% of cases) (Li et al., 1997; Moufarij et al., 2006). CLL cells exhibit high DNA
repair capacity and this was found to correlate with resistance to cytotoxic drugs (Geleziunas
et al., 1991; Deriano et al., 2005). However, to what extent these repair pathways are
involved in response to therapy in CLL, how these processes are regulated and how cell fate
is decided on after DNA damage is not well known. As p53 is the central factor in the
regulation of DNA repair pathways (Ford and Hanawalt, 1997), as well as in the initiation of
the ensuing apoptotic response (reviewed by Rich et al., 2000), the above described synergy
very likely depends on a functional p53 pathway. However, clinical effectiveness in p53dysfunctional patients suggests that an alternative, p53 independent, mechanism is in play in
the activity of the combination of CDDP and F-ara-A.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

As elucidating p53-independent apoptosis pathways may yield useful information for the
development of treatment strategies for chemorefractory patients, we studied how platinumbased compounds abrogate F-ara-A resistance in CLL. We found synergy between the two
classes of drugs, irrespective of p53-functional status. Resistance resulting from CD40
ligation was also overcome. The apoptotic response towards CDDP/F-ara-A combination
treatment was mediated by an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and required
upregulation of the proapoptotic BH3-only protein Noxa. These data stress the potential
clinical relevance of targeting the redox balance to overcome drug resistance in CLL.

Results
Platinum-based compounds sensitize CLL cells to caspase-dependent apoptosis
induction by F-ara-A, independent of p53 function

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The response of CLL cells to increasing doses of CDDP (1–100 μM) was assessed after 24
and 48 h. After 48 h, cell death was seen only in doses above 50 μM. As the Cmax of CDDP
in vivo is within the range indicated by the shaded area in Figure 1a (Monjanel-Mouterde et
al., 2003), and does not exceed 10 μM, CDDP is not expected to be active as a single agent in
CLL (Figure 1a). As expected, p53-functional CLL cells were sensitive to F-ara-A in
increasing doses, whereas p53-dysfunctional CLL samples were resistant, even in doses
much higher than those that can be achieved in vivo (Figures 1b and c). Addition of 10 μM
CDDP, which by itself did not induce cell death, not only enhanced F-ara-A-induced cell
death in p53-functional samples, but also synergistically induced cell death in p53dysfunctional CLL. Significant synergy was already observed with 5 μM F-ara-A.
Assessment of apoptosis by measuring both loss of mitochondrial membrane potential
(MitoTracker staining) as well as phosphatidylserine-exposure (annexin-V/propidium iodide
(PI) staining) yielded comparable results (presented are results from annexin-V/PI staining,
Figures 1b and c; left graph).
Oxaliplatin (DACH oxalate-platinum), a third generation platinum-based compound with
improved pharmacokinetics and toxicity profile in comparison with CDDP, is currently
tested in chemorefractory CLL as component of the oxaliplatin, F-ara-A, cytarabine and
rituximab (OFAR)-regimen. A similar synergistic effect was found by combining oxaliplatin
with F-ara-A, indicating that the observed synergistic effect applies to platinum-based
compounds in general (Figure 1c; right graph).

To analyze whether the observed cell death is caspase-dependent, synergy experiments were
repeated in the presence of the general caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh. Addition of Q-VDOPh significantly abrogated cell death in p53-functional (Supplementary Figure 1) as well in
p53-dysfunctional cells (Figure 1d). Cell death could not be inhibited by the caspase-8
inhibitor Z-IETD-fmk (data not shown), indicating that the mitochondrial, rather than the
extrinsic apoptosis pathway is involved.
Co-treatment of CLL cells with CDDP and F-ara-A results in upregulation of Noxa

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We have described earlier that F-ara-A-induced apoptosis relies on p53-dependent
upregulation of the BH3-only molecule Puma (Mackus et al., 2005). To study whether the
combination of CDDP and F-ara-A results in alterations in the balance between pro- and
antiapoptotic proteins, the mRNA expression level of relevant apoptosis-regulating genes
was assessed by reverse transcriptase-multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (RTMLPA). Treatment with 10 μM CDDP did not result in significant modulation of gene
expression in p53-functional and p53-dysfunctional CLL samples, in accordance with the
absence of an apoptotic response. As expected, as the activity of F-ara-A depends on p53
(Rosenwald et al., 2004; Mackus et al., 2005; Mous et al., 2009), treatment with this drug
induced significant upregulation of the p53-target genes Puma, p21 and Bax in p53functional samples, whereas no upregulation of Puma and Bax was detected in p53dysfunctional samples. Combination treatment with CDDP and F-ara-A induced significant
changes in expression levels of only two genes: p21 and Noxa, irrespective of p53 function
(Figure 2a). To test protein expression levels, cells were treated as indicated in the presence
of Q-VD-OPh to prevent caspase-mediated breakdown of proteins. Noxa protein levels were
clearly increased on combination treatment, whereas no induction occurred upon treatment
with CDDP or F-ara-A as single drugs. Puma protein was upregulated in a p53-dependent
manner (Figures 2b and c). Levels of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family-member Mcl-1, the
principal binding partner of Noxa (Chen et al., 2005), remained stable, as did protein levels
of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bfl-1/A-1 and proapoptotic Bax and Bim (Figures 2b and c and
data not shown).
CD40 ligation does not protect against the cytotoxic effect of CDDP and F-ara-A

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Next to the functional status of p53, protective stimuli derived from the microenvironment
in secondary lymphoid tissue constitute a major determinant of drug resistance in CLL. The
protective microenvironment can, in part, be mimicked in vitro by stimulating CLL cells
with CD40-ligand, which results in increased expression levels of Bcl-xL, Bfl-1/A1 and
Mcl-1 and decreased expression levels of Noxa (Kater et al., 2004; Hallaert et al., 2008;
Vogler et al., 2009). To analyze whether combination treatment with CDDP and F-ara-A
can also overcome chemoresistance due to these protective signals, CLL cells were
cocultured with CD40-ligand expressing fibroblasts for 48 h and subsequently treated with
CDDP and F-ara-A for 48 h. As shown in Figure 3a, cells cocultured with control fibroblasts
were sensitive to F-ara-A, whereas CD40-ligand stimulation resulted in complete resistance
to F-ara-A. Addition of CDDP to F-ara-A resulted in a significant increase in apoptosis
levels despite CD40 ligation.

We have shown earlier that F-ara-A-mediated induction of Puma expression is not abrogated
by CD40-ligand stimulation (Kater et al., 2004). Analysis of protein expression levels on
combination treatment revealed strong upregulation of Noxa (Figure 3b). As Noxa
selectively binds and inhibits Mcl-1 (Chen et al., 2005), these data suggest that induction of
Mcl-1 expression is an important determinant of CD40-ligand-mediated chemoresistance.
The decrease in Mcl-1 protein expression level in CD40-ligand-stimulated cells treated with
CDDP and F-ara-A may be secondary to caspase activation (Clohessy et al., 2004).
Activity of CDDP is not correlated with p73 expression in CLL

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The observed synergy between CDDP and F-ara-A in p53-dysfunctional CLL samples
implies activation of p53-independent apoptosis pathways. Previous studies in various solid
cancers have indicated that the activity of CDDP involves p53-independent upregulation of
p73, a member of the p53 family (Gong et al., 1999). As Noxa is reported to be a response
gene of p73 (Flinterman et al., 2005), we studied whether p73 was upregulated by CDDP in
CLL cells and whether the observed apoptosis was mediated by this protein. We first tested
this hypothesis in the p53-dysfunctional prolymphocytic cell line Mec-1. Upon CDDP
treatment, upregulation of p73 was seen in a time- and dose-dependent manner (data not
shown). Next, we analyzed expression levels of p73 upon treatment with CDDP in p53functional and -dysfunctional CLL cells. No upregulation of p73 protein levels were found
when cells were treated with doses up to 100 μM (Figure 4a) and incubation up to 96 h (data
not shown). CD40 ligation was used as a control, as this was demonstrated to induce
upregulation of p73 protein levels in CLL (Dicker et al., 2006). Also treatment with F-ara-A
or the combination of these drugs had no effect on p73 levels in CLL (Figure 4b).
N-acetylcysteine abrogates apoptosis as well as Noxa upregulation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The mechanism of action of platinum-based compounds is classically described to be
mediated by DNA damage and the ensuing death response (Ali et al., 2005). However,
CDDP binds to many cellular components; in fact only 10–15% is found in the nuclear
compartment, whereas 75–85% is bound to proteins (Akaboshi et al., 1994). Once in the
cell, platinum-based compounds are aquated and become highly reactive. In this form they
rapidly bind cytoplasmatic proteins, among which antioxidant proteins like reduced
glutathione (Hagrman et al., 2004) and constituents of mitochondria causing mitochondrial
dysfunction (Garrido et al., 2008). We hypothesized that in CLL cells, disruption of the
cellular redox balance and the generation of ROS, rather than direct DNA damage, might
contribute to the apoptotic response upon treatment with CDDP. To study whether the
activity of the combination of CDDP and F-ara-A involves generation of ROS, experiments
were performed in the presence of the free radical scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC). As
shown in Figure 5a, apoptosis upon CDDP/F-ara-A combination treatment in p53dysfunctional cells was almost completely abrogated by NAC, whereas sensitivity to F-araA in p53-functional samples was unaffected by the addition of NAC. To confirm that cell
death was abrogated by NAC through its ROS-scavenging properties, experiments were
repeated with the alternative scavengers Tiron and butylated hydroxyl-anisole. These
experiments yielded comparable results, but data analysis was hampered by toxicity of these
compounds after 48 h (Supplementary Figure 2A). Upregulation of Noxa protein levels was
abrogated by co-treatment with NAC, whereas expression levels of Puma remained

unaffected (Figure 5b), which supports a functional role for Noxa in apoptosis induction
upon CDDP/F-ara-A combination treatment. Furthermore, cell death upon combination
treatment in CD40-ligand-stimulated cells could be diminished by the addition of NAC (and
Tiron and butylated hydroxyl-anisole), indicating that also in this setting, death is mediated
by ROS (Figure 5c and Supplementary Figure 2B).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further test our hypothesis, we performed direct assessment of both cellular glutathione
as well as ROS levels. A significant but only partial decrease was found in glutathione levels
within 6 h of treatment, not only in cells treated with high dose CDDP (100 μM), as
expected, but also in cells treated with 10 μM CDDP in combination with 10 μM F-ara-A,
whereas treatment with the drugs at this dose level alone, did not result in a significant
modulation of glutathione levels (Supplementary Figure 2C). Direct assessment of cellular
ROS content revealed an increase in ROS levels within 6 h of combination treatment (Figure
5d; upper left panels and right graph). This occurred well before the loss of mitochondrial
membrane potential (upper left panels) and phosphatidylserine exposure (not shown), which
supports a pivotal role for ROS in the induction of apoptosis. Carbonyl cyanide 3chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), a potent uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation and
inducer of ROS, was used to confirm effects of ROS accumulation in CLL (Figure 5d; lower
left panels).
Accumulation of ROS results in upregulation of Noxa, primarily on a transcriptional level
We further studied the mechanism by which accumulation of ROS results in upregulation of
Noxa. First we determined what source of ROS is most likely accountable for induction of
Noxa protein levels. Cells were treated with either CCCP or with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2,
a common ROS intermediate generated by various extracellular and intracellular ROS
producing sources). Treatment with 100 μM CCCP (and 300 μM H2O2; data not shown)
strongly induced apoptosis within 24 h, independent of p53 function, and this could be
completely abrogated by the addition of NAC (assessed by annexin-V/PI staining; Figure
6a). However, accumulation of Noxa protein was seen after 24 h of treatment with 100 μM
CCCP (Figure 6b), but not with H2O2. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib was used as
positive control. These data suggest that mainly ROS derived from a mitochondrial source
are required for the upregulation of Noxa.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Next, we determined the level at which ROS-dependent Noxa induction is regulated. In
accordance with our findings upon CDDP/F-ara-A treatment (Figure 2a), treatment with
CCCP resulted in upregulation of Noxa mRNA levels, irrespective of p53-functional status
(Figure 6c and Supplementary Figure 3), which was abrogated by the addition of NAC.
Apart from the p53 family, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling
pathways have an important role in deciding cell fate on cellular stress, including oxidative
stress (reviewed in McCubrey et al., 2006). Of these, mainly the JNK and p38 pathways
orchestrate the apoptotic response to cellular stress and are hence grouped together and
referred to as stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK). To investigate the role of stressactivated protein kinases, we treated cells with CCCP in the presence of specific
pharmacological inhibitors of p38 en JNK. As shown in Figure 6b, p38 inhibition abrogated
Noxa upregulation upon CCCP treatment, whereas JNK inhibition did not.

As recently has been shown in CLL cells, Noxa protein has a short half-life through rapid
proteasomal dependent degradation (Baou et al., 2010). We measured proteasome activity in
CLL cells treated with CCCP or bortezomib. Although some decrease in activity was
observed upon CCCP treatment, effects were very limited, especially when compared with
the decrease of proteasomal activity following treatment with bortezomib (decrease in
activity 15–20% versus > 95%) (data not shown).
Knockdown of Noxa attenuates CDDP/F-ara-A-induced cell death
The functional relevance of Noxa upregulation in the apoptotic response upon treatment was
further investigated by means of RNA interference. Cell viability was not affected by the
nucleofection procedure (not shown). Nucleofection with Noxa small-interfering RNA
(siRNA), but not a scrambled control siRNA, resulted in a 50–60% decrease in Noxa protein
expression levels upon combination treatment (Figures 7a and b). Knockdown of Noxa
significantly diminished sensitivity to CDDP/F-ara-A combination treatment and also to
CCCP (Figure 7c). These data indicate a functional role for Noxa in the apoptotic response
following drug-induced, p53-independent ROS accumulation in CLL cells.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Discussion
In this study we show that the combination of CDDP and F-ara-A induces apoptosis in CLL
cells, independent of p53-functional status. The activity of this combination is mediated by
the generation of ROS. The BH3-only protein Noxa was identified as an important factor in
the ensuing apoptotic response. Noxa-mediated apoptosis induction in p53-dysfunctional
cells by CCCP confirms the potency of ROS signaling in p53-independent apoptosis
induction. Furthermore, our data suggest that the MAPK p38 links ROS accumulation to
Noxa induction.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Initially we investigated whether apoptosis was mediated by p73, but although this protein
mediates responses towards CDDP in various cancer types, this seems not to apply in CLL,
as no upregulation of p73 upon CDDP (and/or F-ara-A) treatment was found. Activity of
both drugs is classically described to be based on infliction of DNA damage (Pettitt 2003;
Ali et al., 2005), and the subsequent activation of the DNA repair machinery in which p53,
and possibly p73, have key roles. However the large majority of CLL cells, especially those
derived from peripheral blood, are in G1 arrest. Active DNA replication does not prevail and
in this respect CLL differs from other cancer types. It is therefore, conceivable, that
alternative mechanisms of action of both drugs have a more prominent role in CLL.
Studies in various cancer types have shown that malignant cells are under increased
oxidative stress due to enhanced ROS formation (Zhou et al., 2003). Therefore, the balance
between ROS and antioxidant mechanisms is especially critical in cancer cells, and hence
presents an attractive target for therapeutic intervention (reviewed by Fruehauf and
Meyskens, 2007). Most likely, this also applies to CLL, as in comparison with normal
lymphocytes, CLL cells are under enhanced oxidative stress, which is associated with
oxidative damage to nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (Oltra et al., 2001; Zhou et al., 2003;
Trachootham et al., 2008).

We found that responses to CDDP/F-ara-A combination treatment in CLL were mediated by
the generation of ROS. Cellular ROS content increased within hours after the addition of
drugs. Synergy between these drugs could furthermore be abrogated by the addition of ROS
scavengers. Platinum-based compounds have been shown to stress the cellular redox system
in various ways. CDDP induces mitochondrial dysfunction and an increase in ROS
production by damaging mitochondrial DNA and disruption of the respiratory chain (Witte
et al., 2005; Garrido et al., 2008). Furthermore, CDDP reacts with thiol-containing
molecules like glutathione (Spitz et al., 1993; Hagrman et al., 2004), thereby depleting
intracellular glutathione levels (Husain et al., 1998), and also inhibits thioreduxin reductase,
an important component of the alternative cellular reducing machinery (Witte et al., 2005).
We found a decrease in cellular glutathione levels upon combination treatment, whereas
treatment with single drugs (in clinically relevant doses) did not significantly affect
glutathione levels. However, as we found Noxa upregulation upon treatment with the
uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation CCCP, but not upon treatment with H2O2,
accumulation of ROS from a mitochondrial source may be required to induce upregulation
of Noxa. Clinically attainable doses of CDDP alone did not induce ROS accumulation in our
experiments. It could be that the cellular antioxidant system is capable of neutralizing CDDP
in the used dose within the time period of the experiments. Indeed, when we used
supraphysiological concentrations of CDDP (50–100 mM), a decrease in glutathione levels,
ROS production, Noxa upregulation and apoptosis were observed, which could be abrogated
by the addition of NAC (data not shown). Although F-ara-A as a single agent does not seem
to induce ROS production directly (Rosato et al., 2008), it has been found to enhance ROS
production in leukemia cells when combined with other agents by a yet unrevealed
mechanism (Maggio et al., 2004).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We found that apoptosis was the primary mechanism of cell death induced by combination
treatment, as blocking caspase activation almost completely abrogated death. The BH3-only
protein Noxa had an important role in this process. As the knockdown achieved in our
nucleofection experiments was partial, it is conceivable that the role of Noxa in the apoptotic
response may be underestimated. We have previously shown that in CLL mRNA expression
levels of Noxa are high, independent of p53-functional status (Mackus et al., 2005).
Although the Noxa/Mcl-1 balance was found to be decisive for cell fate in cells residing in
the lymph node (and on CD40 stimulation as its in vitro counterpart; Smit et al., 2007), the
role and regulation of Noxa in CLL-specific responses to drug treatment are not well known.
Noxa is a p53-response gene in many cell types (Oda et al., 2000), but this is not the case in
CLL (Mackus et al., 2005). In this study we show that, at least in CLL, Noxa is the sole
BH3-only member that is induced on ROS signaling. These findings are of particular
interest as they constitute an apoptosis pathway in CLL, which does not depend on p53. We
found that ROS-mediated Noxa upregulation is mainly transcriptional. As inhibition of the
MAPK/SAPK p38 abolished Noxa upregulation, this pathway may have an important role in
the cellular reaction, including induction of Noxa, to oxidative stress. Although in recent
years, it has been increasingly appreciated that MAPK activation may be the major
component deciding cell fate upon CDDP treatment (reviewed in Brozovic and Osmak,
2007), we here describe a novel link between treatment-induced p38 activation and Noxa
induction in CLL. Interestingly, in a very recent report, in keratinocytes Noxa upregulation

following UVB irradiation was also found to be orchestrated by p38 MAPK in a p53independent manner (Nys et al., 2010).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The potential relevance of ROS-dependent apoptosis in drug responses is supported by the
recent observation that F-ara-A resistant cells are highly sensitive to beta-phenylethyl
isothiocyanate, a compound that induces ROS accumulation by disabling the glutathione
system (Trachootham et al., 2008) and data in various other reports that link the response to
drugs, including bendamustine and histone deacetylase inhibitors (Zhou et al., 2003; Roue et
al., 2008; Bhalla et al., 2009; Bouzar et al., 2009; Miller et al., 2009), to p53-independent
ROS production. However, whether ROS production is required for the initiation of
apoptosis, or is a consequence of this could not be conclusively determined for all of these
compounds.

As major advances have recently been made in first- and second-line therapies for patients
with CLL, it is expected that increasing numbers of patients, among whom a substantial
number of p53-dysfunctional cases, will eventually need third-line therapy. Designing
strategies that target the distinguishing biochemical features of malignancy may be a
promising approach. The altered redox balance in cancer represents one of such features, as
ROS adaptation may have a critical role in drug resistance. Our data indicate that
pharmacological induction of ROS or abrogation of cellular adaptive mechanisms to ROS
may be a sensible strategy in high-risk, chemoresistant CLL patients.

Materials and methods
Patient material and cell culture

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with CLL, collected during follow-up visits
at the Department of Hematology, were isolated and subsequently frozen and stored as
previously described (Hallaert et al., 2008). Patient characteristics are summarized in Table
1. Approval for these studies was acquired from the Amsterdam Academic Medical Center
Medical Ethical Committee. Informed consent was obtained in accordance with the
principles of Declaration of Helsinki. All samples included in these studies contained >90%
CD5+CD19+ cells. p53 dysfunction (as assessed by RT-MLPA) was defined as the absence
of upregulation of mRNA expression levels of Puma, Bax and p21 on 5 Gy radiation, as
described (Mous et al., 2009).
Cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA), supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (ICN Biomedicals,
Meckenheim, Germany), 100 μg/ml gentamycin and 5 mML-glutamine (Invitrogen). Where
indicated, CLL cells (1.5–2×106/ml) were stimulated with CD40-ligand for 48 h before drug
treatment as previously described (Hallaert et al., 2008). In the synergy experiments the
following drugs and reagents were used: CDDP (Mayne Pharma, Brussels, Belgium),
oxaliplatin, F-ara-A, CCCP (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), H2O2 (Merck KGaA,
Darmstadt, Germany), p38-i (SB202190), JNK-i (Sp600125; Enzo Life Sciences,

Assessment of apoptosis and ROS production

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Apoptosis was assessed by annexin-V (IQ Products, Groningen, the Netherlands)/(PI)
staining (Sigma-Aldrich) or MitoTracker Orange (Molecular Probes, Leiden, the
Netherlands) staining as previously described (Smit et al., 2007), and analyzed by flow
cytometry. Where indicated specific apoptosis is presented: (% apoptosistreated cells−%
apoptosisuntreated cells)/% viableuntreated cells. For the measurement of cellular ROS content,
cells which had been incubated with drugs for the indicated period of time, were harvested
and washed with prewarmed phenol-red free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium
(Invitrogen) and incubated with 10 μM carboxy-H2-DCFDA (C2938, Invitrogen) dissolved in
warm Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37°C. After 30min, cells were washed and
analyzed by flow cytometry.
mRNA isolation and RT-MLPA

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

CLL cells were incubated with Q-VD-OPh for 30 min at 37 °C before the addition of drugs
as indicated. After the indicated period of time, cells were collected and total mRNA was
isolated using the GenElute mammalian total mRNA miniprep kit (Sigma-Aldrich). A RTMLPA assay (apoptosis kit R011-B1, MRC-Holland, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) was
performed as described previously (Mackus et al., 2005). Expression levels were normalized
for the expression of the housekeeping gene β2-microglobulin. For data presentation gene
expression in treated cells was compared with expression in untreated cells. Genes that
showed at least twofold increase or decrease in mean relative expression level on treatment
were subjected to statistical testing for significance.
Protein isolation and western blot

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

CLL cells, incubated with drugs as indicated, were washed once in ice-cold phosphate
buffered saline, and lysed by sonification in radioimmunoprecipitation buffer as previously
described (Dicker et al., 2006). Protein content was measured using the BCA protein assay
kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL, USA). Around 30 to 100 μM of protein
lysate was loaded onto each lane of a 7.5, 10 or 13% gradient SDS–PAGE gel (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA) and transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride microporous membrane
(PVDF-FL, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Membranes were probed with antibodies
against β-actin (clone I-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), p73
(IMG-246, Imgenex, San Diego, CA, USA), Noxa (IMG-349, Imgenex), Puma (polyclonal,
Cell signaling, Beverly, MA, USA), Bax and Mcl-1 (polyclonal, Pharmingen, Franklin
Lakes, NJ, USA), and Bcl-2 (polyclonal, Alexis, Farmingdale, NY, USA). IRDye 680
donkey anti-rabbit IgG, IRDye 800 donkey anti-goat IgG or IRDye 800 donkey anti-mouse
IgG (Westburg, Leusden, the Netherlands) were used as secondary antibody and blots were
scanned on the Odyssey imager (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA). The indicated
protein expression levels were quantified using LI-COR Odyssey software version 3.0.
Nucleofection
CLL cells were transfected using the Amaxa nucleofection technology (Lonza, Cologne,
Germany) according to the manufacturer's recommendations and as described (Vogler et al.,
2009). In short, CLL cells (5 × 106) were left to recuperate from thawing for 4–6 h and

subsequently spinned down at 1300 r.p.m. for 5 min, resuspended in 100 μl of amaxa buffer
and transfected with 3 μl of siRNA (stock concentration 100 μM) using programme X-01.
Cells were immediately transferred into warm medium and after 1 h of incubation at 37 1C,
drugs were added as indicated. The Noxa siRNA (s10709) and negative control siRNA-1
were used (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA).
Statistics
The Shapiro–Wilk normality test was performed to assess normal distribution of data sets. In
case of Gaussian distribution of the data, a two-sided t-test was used to analyze differences
between data sets. If there was no Gaussian distribution, a two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-test
was used to analyze differences between groups of unpaired samples and a Wilcoxonmatched pairs test to analyze differences between paired samples. For the comparison of
more than two sets of data, the Kruskal–Wallis test was used with a post-hoc Dunn's test in
case of statistical difference. Statistic significance was set at a P-value <0.05.

Co-treatment of CLL cells with F-ara-A and CDDP induces upregulation of Noxa. (a) Cells of three p53-functional (patient nos.
11, 18 and 22) and three p53-dysfunctional (patient nos. 2, 4 and 5) CLL patients were treated with 10 μM CDDP, 10 μM F-ara-A
or with the combination in the presence of Q-VD-OPh. The mRNA expression level of 30 apoptosis-regulating genes was
assessed by RT-MLPA (as described in the Materials and methods section). Gene expression following treatment was related to
gene expression in untreated cells. The resulting matrix was imported in the program MultiExperiment Viewer (www.tigr.org/
software/tm4), and values were assigned green or red colors; green for values between 0 and 1, indicating downregulation and
red for values >1, indicating upregulation. The CLL samples are ordered as indicated below the matrix. In the right hand
column, the genes are ordered by functional category (HKG, housekeeping genes; β2M, β2-microglobulin). Significant changes
in expression are indicated with (*) for p53+ samples and (†) for p53− samples (P<0.05, Kruskal–Wallis test with post-hoc
Dunn's test). (b) CLL cells were treated with 10 μM CDDP, 10 μM F-ara-A or the combination as indicated for 48 h in the
presence of Q-VD-OPh to prevent caspase-dependent breakdown of proteins. Protein lysates were analyzed for Mcl-1, Puma
and Noxa expression by western blot. Actin was used as loading control. Shown is a representative blot of both a p53-functional
(patient no. 20) and a p53-dysfunctional CLL samples (patient no. 3). (c) Summarized data of the relative expression (compared

CDDP treatment does not induce p73 in CLL. (a) CLL cells of two patients with functional (patient nos. 19 and 20) and two
with dysfunctional p53 (patient nos. 2 and 3) were treated with 10 or 100 μM CDDP; after 48 h, p73-protein expression levels
were assessed by western blot. As control, CLL cells were cocultured with CD40-ligand expressing fibroblasts for 24 h and
analyzed for p73 expression after an additional 24 or 48 h (patient no. 20). Lysates were obtained in the same experiment and
loaded on separate gels. As antibody control a lysate of HEK293 cells transfected with a construct encoding HA-tagged p73 was

Apoptosis and Noxa upregulation on CDDP/F-ara-A combination treatment are mediated by ROS. (a) p53-dysfunctional (n = 5;
patient nos. 1–5) and p53-functional (n = 4; patient nos. 11, 12, 18 and 21) CLL samples were preincubated with 5 mM NAC for
30 min and subsequently treated with F-ara-A in increasing doses (5–50 μM), with or without 10 μM CDDP, for 48 h. Apoptosis
was assessed by annexin-V/PI staining. Presented is mean + s.e.m. (b) CLL cells were treated for 48 h as indicated (M = control,
C = 10 μM CDDP, F = 10 μM F-ara-A, CF = CDDP/F-ara-A both 10 μM) with or without preincubation with 5 mM NAC and
analyzed for protein expression levels of Mcl-1, Puma, Noxa and actin. Experiments for protein collection were performed in
the presence of Q-VD-OPh to prevent caspase-dependent breakdown of proteins. Percentage of apoptosis was assessed by
annexin-V/PI staining (patient nos. 2 and 22; representative of six patients tested). (c) CLL cells, which have been cocultured
with CD40L-expressing or control 3T3 fibroblast for 48 h, were treated for 48 h with 10 μM CDDP and 10 μM F-ara-A with or
without preincubation with 5 mM NAC (n = 5; patient nos. 7, 15, 16, 21 and 22). Percentage of apoptosis was assessed by
annexin-V/PI staining; bars represent mean + s.e.m. (**P<0.01; Mann–Whitney U-test). (d) Left panels: ROS content was
determined by carboxy-H2-DCFDA staining and flow cytometry (as described in the Materials and methods section) after 6 h of
treatment with 10 μM CDDP and 10 μM F-ara-A (C + F; open graph; upper panels) and compared with ROS content of untreated
(gray graph) or CCCP (100 μM)-treated cells (open graph; lower panels) (patient no. 2). Loss of mitochondrial potential was
assessed by MitoTracker staining. Right graph: summarized data of cellular ROS content after 6 h of treatment as indicated
compared with ROS content of control sample (n = 4, patient nos. 1, 2, 3 and 5). Presented is mean + s.e.m. (*P<0.05,
**P<0.01; Mann–Whitney U-test).

(a) p53-dysfunctional (n = 5; patient nos. 2–6) and p53-functional (n = 5; patient nos. 11, 19–22) CLL cells were treated with
100 μM CCCP for 24 h with or without preincubation with 5 mM NAC for 30 min. Apoptosis was assessed by annexin-V/PI
staining. Presented is mean + s.e.m. (**P<0.01; Mann–Whitney U-test). (b) CLL cells were treated with 300 μM H2O2,, 30 nM
bortezomib (b) or 100 μM CCCP (as indicated) for 24 h in the presence of Q-VD-OPh to prevent caspase-dependent breakdown
of proteins. Protein lysates were analyzed for Noxa expression by western blot. Actin was used as loading control. Shown is a
representative blot (patient no. 23) of three independent experiments. (c) Cells of three p53-functional (patient nos. 11, 18 and
22) CLL patients were treated with 100 μM CCCP with or without preincubation with 5 mM NAC for 30 min in the presence of
Q-VD-OPh. The mRNA expression level of 30 apoptosis-regulating genes was assessed by RT-MLPA (as described in the
Materials and methods section). Presented are the mRNA expression levels of Noxa normalized for β2-microglobulin. (*P<0.05,
Student's t-test). For complete results of the assay see Supplementary Figure 3. (d) Left panels: CLL cells (patient no. 24) were
treated with 100 μM CCCP with or without 10 μM of the MAPK-inhibitors p38-i (SB202190) or JNK-i (Sp600125; as indicated)
for 24 h in the presence of Q-VD-OPh to prevent caspase-dependent breakdown of proteins. Protein lysates were analyzed for
Noxa expression by western blot. Actin was used as loading control. Right graph: summarized data of the relative expression
(compared with control) of Noxa in three CLL samples on treatment as described in (b). Protein expression was quantified using
Licor Odyssey software and corrected for the expression of actin. Bars represent mean + s.e.m.

Apoptosis induced by CDDP/F-ara-A combination treatment is mediated by Noxa. (a) Protein expression levels of Noxa and
actin in untransfected cells and in cells nucleofected with Noxa or control (scr) siRNA, untreated (left panels) or treated with 10
μM CDDP and 10 μM F-ara-A for 48 h (right panels), were analyzed by western blot for control of knockdown of Noxa.
Apoptosis was assessed by MitoTracker staining (patient no. 1). (b) Protein expression levels in four patients (patient nos. 1–3
and 5), treated as described in (a) were quantified using Licor Odyssey software and the Noxa/Mcl-1 ratio was calculated. Noxa/
Mcl-1 ratio of untransfected cells was set to 1. Bars represent mean + s.e.m. (*P<0.05, Mann–Whitney U-test). (c) Cells of p53dysfunctional CLL patients were transfected with Noxa RNAi or control scrambled (Scr) RNAi and treated with 10 μM CDDP
and 10 μM F-ara-A for 48 h, 100 μM CCCP for 24 h or left untreated. Apoptosis was assessed using annexin-V/PI staining (n = 4;
patient nos. 1–3 and 5). Bars represent mean + s.e.m. (*P<0.05, Mann–Whitney U-test).
