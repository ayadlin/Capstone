ABSTRACT
Zanthoxylum fruit, obtained from the Japanese pepper plant (Zanthoxylum
piperitum De Candolle), and its extract (Zanthoxylum fruit extract, ZFE) have multiple
physiological activities (e.g., antiviral activity). However, the potential anticancer
activity of ZFE has not been fully examined. In this study, we investigated the ability
of ZFE to induce autophagic cell death (ACD). ZFE caused remarkable autophagy-like
cytoplasmic vacuolization, inhibited cell proliferation, and ultimately induced cell
death in the human cancer cell lines DLD-1, HepG2, and Caco-2, but not in A549, MCF7, or WiDr cells. ZFE increased the level of LC3-II protein, a marker of autophagy.
Knockdown of ATG5 using siRNA inhibited ZFE-induced cytoplasmic vacuolization and
cell death. Moreover, in cancer cells that could be induced to undergo cell death by
ZFE, the extract increased the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and
the JNK inhibitor SP600125 attenuated both vacuolization and cell death. Based on
morphology and expression of marker proteins, ZFE-induced cell death was neither
apoptosis nor necrosis. Normal intestinal cells were not affected by ZFE. Taken
together, our findings show that ZFE induces JNK-dependent ACD, which appears to
be the main mechanism underlying its anticancer activity, suggesting a promising
starting point for anticancer drug development.

in Japanese cuisine. Zanthoxylum fruit obtained from
ZPDC is also an important component of kampo, a form
of Japanese traditional medicine [3, 4]. Previous studies
on ZPDC constituents have revealed they can prevent
propagation of influenza virus [5], inhibit adipogenesis in
an obese mouse model [6], induce vascular relaxation via
endothelium-dependent NO-cGMP signaling [7], inhibit
cholesterol acyltransferase activity [8], and act as potent
tyrosinase inhibitors [9].
In contrast to its effects on other diseases, the
anticancer activity of ZPDC has not been widely
investigated. The anticancer effects of two different
forms of Zanthoxylum have been cited in the literature.
In one study, an extract from Chinese pepper was shown
to inhibit the growth of Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)deficient malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor cells by

INTRODUCTION
Cancer is one of the leading causes of death
worldwide, and global cancer rates are predicted to
increase over the coming years. Chemotherapy is one of
the major treatment methods for cancer. Natural products
constitute a promising resource for drug development and
have always played a key role in pharmaceutical research
[1]. Moreover, many single compounds derived from
herbs, as well as herbal extracts, have been used clinically
to treat various diseases including cancer [2].
Zanthoxylum piperitum De Candolle (ZPDC), a
deciduous aromatic spiny shrub or small tree native to
Japan, is of considerable commercial importance. The
dried powder of the pulverized mature fruits of ZPDC,
known as ‘Japanese pepper’, is a commonly used spice

blocking the PAK1/cyclin D1 pathway [10]. In addition,
a phytoglycoprotein from Korean ZPDC was reported to
inhibit hepatocarcinogenesis [11].
In this study, we tested the anticancer effect of
Zanthoxylum fruit extract (ZFE) on four different types
of human cancer cell lines (colon, liver, lung, and breast)
and then investigated its molecular mechanism of action in
the colorectal cancer cell line DLD-1. We found that ZFE
causes remarkable cytoplasmic vacuolization in certain
types of human cancer cells, leading to the inhibition of
cell proliferation and ultimately inducing autophagic cell
death (ACD).

of autophagy by ZFE, we performed Western blotting to
analyze the conversion of cytosolic LC3-I into LC3-II in
DLD-1 cells. ZFE induced a time-dependent increase in
LC3-II levels, confirming elevation of autophagic activity
(Figure 2b).

Knockdown of an essential autophagy protein
prevents ZFE-induced ACD
Autophagy can be inhibited by knocking down the
expression of essential autophagy-related genes (ATG).
We performed knockdown of ATG5 by transfecting
DLD-1 cells with two different small interfering RNAs
(siRNAs). Knockdown of ATG5 expression at both the
RNA and protein level were confirmed by quantitative RTqPCR and Western blot analysis, respectively (Figure 3a
and 3b, Supplementary Figure S2a and S2b). Autophagic
vacuolization induced by ZFE was suppressed by ATG5
knockdown (Figure 3c, Supplementary Figure S2c).
Furthermore, the reduction in proliferation following
treatment with ZFE was significantly attenuated by
knockdown of ATG5 (Figure 3d, Supplementary Figure
S2d).

RESULTS
ZFE induces vacuolization, inhibition of cell
growth, and death in cancer cells
First, we investigated the effect of ZFE on the
morphology of cancer cells using phase-contrast
microscopy. After 24 h treatment with ZFE, numerous
vacuoles were observed in the cytoplasm of DLD-1,
HepG2, and Caco-2 cells, but not in A549, MCF-7,
or WiDr cells (Figure 1a, Supplementary Figure S1a).
To determine the effect of ZFE on the proliferation of
cancer cells, we performed cell proliferation assays.
Proliferation of DLD-1, HepG2, and Caco-2 cells was
significantly inhibited after 48 h of ZFE treatment (Figure
1b, Supplementary Figure S1b). By contrast, no inhibition
of cell growth was observed in A549, MCF-7, or WiDr
cells. Therefore, we investigated the mechanism of the
anticancer effect of ZFE in more detail in the human
colorectal cancer cell line DLD-1. After 72 h treatment
with ZFE, viability and number of DLD-1 cells were
reduced by approximately 45% and 25%, respectively,
relative to controls (Figure 1c). To characterize ZFEinduced cell death, we assessed markers of apoptosis
and caspase-3/-7 activity in the ZFE treated DLD-1 cells.
No increase in caspase activity was detected in either
ZFE-treated or untreated DLD-1 cells, whereas the cells
were able to respond to doxorubicin, an activator of
caspase-3/-7 (Figure 1d), suggesting that apoptosis is not
involved in ZFE-induced cell death.

The role of c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation
in ACD
To determine the effect of ZFE on c-Jun N-terminal
kinase (JNK), we performed Western blots to measure
the phosphorylation of JNK in six types of cancer cells.
Phosphorylation of JNK was increased by ZFE in DLD1, HepG2, and Caco-2 cells, but not in A549, MCF-7, or
WiDr cells (Figure 4a and 4b and Supplementary Figure
S3a). Next, to explore the role of JNK activation in
ZFE-induced ACD, we examined the effects of ZFE on
autophagy and proliferation of DLD-1 cells in the presence
or absence of the JNK inhibitor SP600125. This compound
decreased LC3-II levels and suppressed autophagic
vacuolization in ZFE-treated DLD-1 cells (Figure 4a and
4c). Furthermore, the reduction in proliferation following
treatment with ZFE was significantly attenuated by JNK
inhibitor treatment (Figure 4d).

Effect of ZFE on the normal rat intestinal cell
line IEC-6

ZFE stimulates autophagy in the colon cancer
cell

To explore the effect of ZFE on normal cells, we
treated the rat intestinal cell line IEC-6 with ZFE and
examined morphological changes, cell proliferation, and
JNK activity. ZFE had no effect on any of these features.
(Figure 5a and 5b and Supplementary Figure S3b).

The occurrence of vacuoles induced by treatment
with ZFE was confirmed by electron microscopy (Figure
2a). Electron-microscopic examination of DLD-1 cells
after 24 h treatment with ZFE revealed abundant vacuoles
and double-membrane structures sequestering cellular
organelles, i.e., autophagosomes. These morphological
observations strongly suggested that ZFE induces
autophagy in DLD-1 cells. To further confirm induction

proliferation, and induces cell death in certain human
cancer cell lines. Furthermore, our results strongly suggest
that excess activation of autophagy and JNK-dependent
ACD are the main mechanisms underlying the anticancer
activity of ZFE.
Autophagy is an intracellular degradation system
that delivers cytoplasmic constituents to the lysosome
[12, 13]. As such, autophagy plays an important role
in the clearance of long-lived proteins and damaged
organelles, such as mitochondria, as well as the removal
of intracellular pathogens [14].
Cancer cells are likely to be more dependent on
autophagy than normal cells [15]. Indeed, basal autophagy
activity is elevated in the hypoxic regions of tumors [16].
Cancer cells subjected to stress (e.g., hypoxic environment
and/or limited nutrient supply) maximize their energy
production, which is required for proliferation, by
upregulating autophagy [17].
In some circumstances, excessive activation of
autophagy can lead to cell death. ACD, which refers to cell
death caused by supraphysiological levels of autophagy,
is accompanied by extensive autophagic vacuolization of
the cytoplasm and a characteristic vacuolated appearance
[18]. It has been proposed that ACD should be regarded as

a modality of non-apoptotic and non-necrotic programmed
cell death, in which autophagy serves as the mechanism
of cell death. Criteria for ACD include the following: (i)
cell death occurs without the involvement of apoptosis;
(ii) there is an increase in the autophagic flux, not just an
increase of autophagic markers, in dying cells; and (iii)
suppression of autophagy via pharmacological inhibitors
and/or genetic approaches can rescue or prevent cell death
[19].
ACD is morphologically defined (especially by
transmission electron microscopy) as cell death that occurs
in the absence of apoptosis (i.e., chromatin condensation,
nuclear fragmentation) or necrosis (i.e., oncosis,
swelling of organelles), and is accompanied by the
appearance of autophagic vacuoles (i.e., autophagosomes,
autolysosomes) in the cytoplasm, resulting in a vacuolated
appearance. With this morphological definition in mind,
we observed that cancer cells treated with ZFE exhibited
an increase in autophagic flux. This observation was
confirmed by increased expression of autophagic
markers (i.e., LC3-II). Endogenous LC3 is processed
posttranslationally into LC3-I, a cytosolic protein.
LC3-I (18 kDa) is then converted to LC3-II (16 kDa),
which associates with autophagosome membranes

[20]. Moreover, the level of LC3-II relative to actin is
correlated with the number of autophagosomes per cell
[21]. Therefore, ZFE-induced cell death resembled ACD,
as determined by morphology and the level of a key
autophagic marker.
However, the definition of ACD also requires
that cell death can be suppressed by inhibition of the
autophagic pathway by treatment with chemicals and/or
genetic means (e.g., gene knockout/mutation or RNAi
targeting of essential autophagic modulators) [22]. The
autophagy-related gene 5 (ATG5)-ATG12 complex,
a key regulator of the early autophagic pathway, is
required for the formation of autophagosomes. We
demonstrated that ZFE-induced cancer cell death and
autophagic vacuolization were clearly suppressed by
ATG5 knockdown. Thus, ZFE-induced cancer cell death
is compatible with the definition of ACD. However, the
precise mechanism underlying ACD is still unclear, and
the link between autophagy and cell death remains to be
elucidated.
Induction of high levels of autophagy may provide
a valuable therapeutic strategy for treating cancer. The
prospect of establishing novel cancer treatments by
modulating autophagy has improved in recent years.
Indeed, preclinical studies have been conducted to
investigate induction of autophagy and/or ACD for the

purpose of cancer therapy [23, 24]. Natural compounds
such as resveratrol and curcumin have been implicated
in the induction of ACD in various cancer cell lines in
vitro [24–26]. The findings in these reports are compatible
with the observations reported in this study. Thus, ZFE
represents a promising starting point for the development
of anticancer drugs that act by inducing ACD.
ACD does not simply involve excessive activation
of autophagy, but also entails accumulation of ROS
and ER stress [27, 28]. We have not yet examined ROS
production and ER stress in this context.
The JNK pathway is involved in regulating
autophagy of cancer cells in response to various stressors
(i.e., starvation, oxidative stress, and pharmacological
agents) [29–31]. Moreover, recent studies have indicated
that activation of JNK is involved in ACD [32–34]. In this
study, we showed that ZFE-induced autophagy and ACD
of cancer cells increased JNK phosphorylation. Our results
also showed that JNK inhibitor attenuated both ZFEinduced autophagy and ACD in DLD-1 cells. By contrast,
ZFE did not exert these effects in normal intestinal cells or
other types of cancer cells (i.e., A549, MCF-7, and WiDr).
These results indicate that activation of the JNK pathway
is required for ZFE-induced ACD.
The JNK pathway is also involved in the induction
of apoptosis [35]. However, our results did not support the

involvement of apoptosis in ZFE-induced cell death. This
observation agreed closely with previous results reported
by Shimizu et al., who reported that activation of JNK
caused autophagic cell death rather than apoptosis in cells
that were already resistant to apoptosis [36].
Taken together, our findings indicate that activation
of the JNK pathway is a crucial mechanism of ZFEinduced ACD. Further studies are needed to explore the
molecular details of this process.
We also attempted to identify the active
component(s) of ZFE. Hydroxy-α-sanshool (HAS)
and hydroxy-β-sanshool (HBS) are the most abundant
extractable components of ZF, and these compounds have

several physiological activities. HAS induces the release
and/or production of adrenomedullin, a potent vasodilator
peptide hormone, by directly interacting with intestinal
epithelial cells [37], and also inhibits two-pore domain
potassium (KCNK) channels 9 involved in bowel motility
[38]. Based on these findings, we investigated the possible
anticancer effect of HAS and HBS on DLD-1 cells.
However, no such anticancer activity could be detected for
either compound, in contrast to the results obtained using
ZFE (Supplementary Figure S4). Therefore, it is unlikely
that HAS and HBS are involved in the anticancer effects
of ZFE. Further studies are needed to identify the active
anticancer component(s) of ZFE.

In summary, we showed that ZFE induces
vacuolization and inhibits proliferation of human
colorectal and liver cancer cells. Analysis of the anticancer
mechanism using DLD-1 cells demonstrated that ZFE
activates autophagy, leading to ACD. Taken together, our
findings provide novel evidence suggesting that ZFE is a
useful tool for analyzing ACD in cancer cells. Moreover,
ZFE represents be a promising resource for anticancer
drug development.

24 h. The cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde–2%
glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 30
min at 4°C, followed by 1% OsO4 for 1 h at 4°C. The
cells were gently scraped from the dishes and pelleted in
a microcentrifuge. Pelleted cells were then dehydrated
with a graded series of ethanol and finally embedded
in Epon 812. The ultra-thin sections were cut with an
ultramicrotome, contrasted with saturated aqueous
solutions of uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined
using a transmission electron microscope (H-7650; Hitachi
High Technologies, Tokyo, Japan).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell proliferation assay

Reagents and antibodies

Human cancer cell lines and IEC-6 cells were seeded
into 96-well plates at a density of 4 × 103 cells/well and
6 × 103 cells/well, respectively, and incubated overnight
to allow cell adherence. The medium was replaced with
DMEM (3% FBS) supplemented with 200 μg/ml ZFE
and/or 5 μM SP600125 (final concentrations). In negative
control samples, the replacement medium consisted of
DMEM (3% FBS) supplemented with 0.2% DMSO. Cells
were incubated for 24, 48, or 72 h at 37°C under a 5% CO2
atmosphere. Proliferation was detected using the CellTiter
96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit
(Promega, Fitchburg, WI).

Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was purchased from
Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd. (Osaka, Japan).
Doxorubicin and SP600125 were obtained from SigmaAldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Hydroxy-α-sanshool and
hydroxy-β-sanshool were obtained from Tsumura (Tokyo,
Japan). The following antibodies were used for Western
blotting analyses: anti-LC3 pAb (PD014), anti-Atg5 mAb
(M153-3) (Medical and Biological Laboratories Co. Ltd,
Nagoya, Japan), anti-phospho-JNK pAb (Thr183/Tyr185)
(#9251S), anti-JNK pAb (#9252S), anti-β-Actin mAb
(#4970) (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA).

Trypan blue exclusion test

Preparation of the extract from
Zanthoxylum fruit

DLD-1 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a
density of 5 × 104 cells/well and incubated for 48 h to
allow cell adherence. Subsequently, the cells were treated
with 0.2% DMSO or 200 μg/ml ZFE. Cells were incubated
for 48 or 72 h at 37°C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells
were then harvested, and Trypan blue was added to the cell
suspension to a final concentration of 0.2%. The stained
cells were counted on a Countess II FL Automated Cell
Counter (Thermo Fisher SCIENTIFIC, Waltham, MA,
USA). Cell viability was defined as the percentage of live
cells (i.e., excluding those staining positively with Trypan
blue).

Preparation of Zanthoxylum fruit extract powder,
provided by Tsumura (Tokyo, Japan), is described briefly
according to Tsumura. The peel of Zanthoxylum fruit was
extracted with purified water at 100°C for 1 h. The soluble
extract was then separated from the insoluble waste and
concentrated by removal of water under reduced pressure.
Spray drying was used to generate a dried extract powder.
ZFE powder was dissolved in DMSO and sonicated,
and the resultant ZFE solution was used to supplement
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Wako
Pure Chemical Industries Ltd.) with 3% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and filtered
through a 0.22 μm filter unit.

Caspase-3 and-7 assay

Human cancer cell lines DLD-1, HepG2, A549,
MCF-7, Caco-2, and WiDr and the normal rat small
intestinal cell line IEC-6 were cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS at 37°C in a 5% CO2
atmosphere.

Caspase-3/-7 activities in DLD-1 cells treated with
0.2% DMSO, 200 μg/ml of ZFE or 7 μM doxorubicin
were measured using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay kit
(Promega). The luminescence of each well was measured
with a multilabel plate counter (Infinite 200 PRO; Tecan,
Männedorf, Switzerland). Luminescence from blank
wells (medium without cells) was subtracted. Data were
normalized against the luminescence of control cells.

for 2–24 h at 37°C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The
cells were subsequently washed with ice-cold Trisbuffered saline (TBS) and lysed with 100 μl of cell lysis
buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.8], 0.8% w/v SDS, 4%
w/v glycerol, 0.008% w/v bromophenol blue, 2% v/v
2-mercaptoethanol). The lysate was boiled at 95°C for
5 min, and then centrifuged at 10,000×g for 5 min. Ten
microliters of each sample was loaded onto a 12.5%
SDS-polyacrylamide gel; proteins were separated by
electrophoresis, and then transferred to Immobilon-P
membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) by
electroblotting. The membranes were immunoblotted with
the following antibodies: anti-LC3 pAb, anti-Atg5 mAb,
anti-phospho-JNK pAb, anti-JNK pAb, and anti-β-actin
mAb. The bound primary antibodies were incubated with
horseradish peroxidase–conjugated antibody against rabbit
IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove,
PA, USA) and detected using Immobilon Western HRP
Substrate detection reagents (Millipore). Band images
were acquired using a LAS 4010 system (GE Healthcare
Life Sciences, Amersham, UK).

Statistical significance was analyzed using Student’s
t-test or Dunnett’s test and values of P < 0.05 were
considered statistically significant. All data represent
results from at least three independent experiments. Error

PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
Conditions for real-time PCR were as follows: initial
incubation at 50°C for 2 min and 95°C for 2 min, followed
by 45 cycles of denaturation 95°C for 15 s, annealing at
60°C for 30 s, extension at 72°C for 1 min, and a final
round of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 15 s and 95°C for 15 s.
GAPDH mRNA was used to standardize the total amount
of cDNA in real-time PCR. The relative levels of each
transcript were determined using the ΔΔCT method, using
GAPDH as the control. The primers used for PCR were as
follows: ATG5, 5’-TTTGGGCCATCAATCGGAAACT-3’
and 5’-CCACAGGACGAAACAGCTTCT-3’; and
GAPDH, 5’-CATGAGAAGTATGACAACAGCCT-3’ and
5’-AGTCCTTCCACGATACCAAAGT-3’.
