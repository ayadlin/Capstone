ABSTRACT
Recent studies have demonstrated that acquisition of epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) is associated with drug resistance in pancreatic cancer cells; however,
the underlying mechanisms are not fully elucidated. Emerging evidence suggests
that microRNAs play a crucial role in controlling EMT. The aims of this study were to
explore the potential role of miR-223 in governing EMT in gemcitabine-resistant (GR)
pancreatic cancer cells. To achieve this goal, real-time reverse transcription-PCR and
western blot analysis were used to validate whether GR cells acquired EMT in AsPC-1
and PANC-1 cells. Invasion, migration, and detachment assays were performed to
further identify the EMT characteristics in GR cells. The miR-223 inhibitor was used to
determine its role in GR-induced EMT. We found that GR cells acquired EMT features,
which obtained elongated fibroblastoid morphology, decreased expression of epithelial
marker E-cadherin, and up-regulation of mesenchymal markers. Furthermore, we
observed that GR cells are associated with high expression of miR-223. Notably,
inhibition of miR-223 led to the reversal of EMT phenotype. More importantly, miR223 governs GR-induced EMT in part due to down-regulation of its target Fbw7 and
subsequent upregulation of Notch-1 in pancreatic cancer. Our study implied that
down-regulation of miR-223 could be a novel therapy for pancreatic cancer.

for PC patients, the overall 5-year survival rate of
PC is less than 6% [1]. Thus, it is vital to explore the
molecular mechanism of drug resistance to gemcitabine,
which could help us to find a promising strategy for the
treatment of PC.
Emerging evidence has demonstrated that epithelialto-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an essential
role in the progression of PC [5]. It is known that during
EMT process, epithelial cells acquire mesenchymal
phenotype, resulting in enhanced invasion and metastasis
[6]. Concomitantly, epithelial cells loss the expression of
epithelial markers such as E-cadherin, whereas cells obtain

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of lethal malignant
tumors with high morbidity and mortality. Approximately
46,420 new cases and 39,590 deaths were expected to
occur from PC in 2014 [1]. It has been well known that
one of the reasons for the aggressiveness of PC was due to
its intrinsic and extrinsic drug resistance to chemotherapy
[2]. The standard chemotherapy was gemcitabine alone or
in combination with other chemo-therapeutic agents for
advanced PC patients [3, 4]. Although chemotherapy and
systemic treatments have improved effective therapies

higher expression of mesenchymal markers including
Vimentin, Snail, Slug, zinc-finger E-box binding homeobox
1 (ZEB1) and ZEB2 [7]. There is growing evidence that
EMT is associated with drug resistance [8, 9]. For example,
the transcription factor Twist1, one of EMT inducers,
has been found to be involved in tumor metastasis and
chemoresistance in ovarian cancer cells [10]. Furthermore,
it has been shown that erlotinib resistance associated
with EMT is due to dysregulation of Steroid receptor or
coactivator/focal adhesion kinase (Src/FAK) pathway in
non-small cell lung cancers [11]. Moreover, gemcitabine
resistance is associated with EMT and induction of plateletderived growth factor D (PDGF-D) and HIF-1alpha (HIF1α) in PC cells [12–14].
Multiple studies have indicated that microRNAs
(miRNAs) was critically involved in regulation of drug
resistance-mediated EMT [15]. It has been found that upregulation of miR-200 and let-7 led to the reversal of EMT
in gemcitabine-resistant PC cells [16]. Similarly, another
study identified that miR-200 expression regulates EMT in
bladder cancer cells and reverses resistance to epidermal
growth receptor therapy [17]. Moreover, the expression
levels of miR-200c and its target, mitogen-inducible
gene 6, are highly correlated with EMT and resistance
to erlotinib [18]. Similarly, miR-200c counteracts
trastuzumab resistance and metastasis through targeting
zinc finger gene 217 (ZNF217) and ZEB1 in breast
cancer [19]. Furthermore, miR-200b and miR-15b
regulate cisplatin-induced EMT by targeting B lymphoma
Mo-MLV insertion region 1 homolog (BMI1) in human
tongue cancer cells [20]. Additionally, re-expression of
miR-375 was found to sensitize tamoxifen resistance and
reverse EMT in tamoxifen resistant breast cancer cells
[21]. Notably, miR-365 was found to induce gemcitabine
resistance in PC cells via targeting apoptosis-promoting
protein BAX and Src homology 2 domain containing 1
(SHC1) [22]. Chang et al. reported that overexpression
of let-7d effectively reversed the EMT and increased
the chemosensitivity in oral cancer cells, whereas downregulation of let-7d increased chemo-resistant abilities
of oral cancer cells [23]. These findings suggest the
important role of miRNAs in regulation of chemotherapyinduced EMT. However, whether miR-223 is involved in
regulating chemotherapy-induced EMT in human cancer
remains unclear.
In the present study, we explored the role of
miR-223 in regulating gemcitabine-induced EMT. We
established stable gemcitabine-resistant PC cell lines
AsPC-1 gemcitabine resistance (GR) and PANC-1 GR. We
found that AsPC-1 GR and PANC-1 GR cells displayed
mesenchymal features and acquired increased motility
and invasiveness. Moreover, we revealed that miR-223
was highly expressed in both GR cells. More importantly,
we identified that downregulation of miR-223 led to the
reversal of EMT phenotype and inhibition of migration

and invasion in GR cells. Therefore, miR-223 could
be a novel therapeutic target to reverse chemotherapy
resistance in PC.

RESULTS
Establishment of gemcitabine-resistant cell lines
To determine the mechanism of drug resistance in
PC, we created the gemcitabine-resistant (GR) PC cell
lines. The AsPC-1 and PANC-1 cells were treated with
increasing concentrations of gemcitabine for more than 6
months. We observed that 100μM gemcitabine treatment
caused about 65% growth inhibition in AsPC-1 cells
(Figure 1A). Similarly, 5μM gemcitabine treatment led to
about 50% growth inhibition in PANC-1 cells (Figure 1A).
These findings suggest that these two PC cell lines
exhibited different sensitivity to gemcitabine. However,
100μM gemcitabine and 5μM gemcitabine did not cause
the cell growth inhibition in AsPC-1 GR and PANC-1
GR, respectively. The resistant cells were continuously
maintained in culture medium containing gemcitabine for
the following study.

GR cells show EMT characteristics
Previous studies have demonstrated that BxPC-3 GR
cells acquired EMT characteristics [13, 24]. In line with
this notion, we observed that AsPC-1 GR and PANC-1
GR cells exhibited EMT phenotype. Specifically, we
observed the markedly morphologic changes associated
with EMT feature in GR cells (Figure 1B). As shown in
Figure 1B, AsPC-1 and PANC-1 cells displayed a rounded
shape, whereas GR cells exhibited elongated, fibroblastoid
morphology. Consistently, we found that GR cells have
significantly increased numbers of invaded cells through
a Matrigel-coated membrane compared with parental
cells (Figure 1C, 1D), suggesting that GR cells obtained
enhanced invasion.

GR cells acquire EMT feature
It is known that after EMT, cells have increased
migration and metastasis. To explore whether GR
cells have aggressive characteristics, we measured the
migration in parental cells and GR cells. Our migration
results showed that GR cells have increased migration
compared with their parental cells (Figure 2A). To
further validate whether GR cells have enhanced
motility, we detected cell migration using wound-healing
assay. We found that GR cells have higher numbers
of cells migrating across the wound (Figure 2B).
In line with these findings, we identified that GR
cells have increased attached and detached activities
(Figure 2C).

GR cells have EMT molecular marker changes

cells, we detected the expression of miR-223 in GR cells
and their parental cells. We observed that miR-223 was
highly expressed in GR cells (Figure 4A), suggesting that
GR-mediated EMT could be partly due to over-expression
of miR-223.

To identify whether GR cells have EMT molecular
marker changes, we measured the mRNA levels of EMT
markers using RT-PCR in paired parental cells and GR
cells. We found that epithelial molecule E-cadherin
mRNA was down-regulated, while the mRNA levels
of mesenchymal markers including Vimentin, Snail,
Slug, ZEB1 and ZEB2 were up-regulated in GR cells
(Figure 3A and 3C). To validate whether the protein
levels of EMT markers have changes, we determined the
expression of these EMT molecules by Western blotting
analysis. Consistent with RT-PCR results, Western blotting
analysis showed that GR cells have decreased E-cadherin
expression, but higher expression of mesenchymal
markers (Figure 3B and 3D). These results further suggest
that GR cells acquired a mesenchymal phenotype.

Inhibition of miR-223 reverses EMT in GR cells
To further determine the role of miR-223 in EMTtype GR cells, we inhibited the expression of miR-223
by its specific inhibitor. We found that miR-223 inhibitor
treatment caused round cell-like morphology in AsPC-1
GR and PANC-1 GR cells (Figure 4B). Moreover, we
examined the expression of EMT molecules in GR
cells transfected with miR-223 inhibitor by real-time
RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis. We found that the
expression of E-cadherin was significantly increased in GR
cells after inhibition of miR-223, whereas the expression
of mesenchymal markers including Vimentin, Snail, Slug,
ZEB1 and ZEB2 was markedly deceased in GR cells
with miR-223 inhibitor treatment (Figure 4C and 4D,
Supplementary Figure 1). These findings identified that
down-regulation of miR-223 could reverse EMT to MET
in GR cells.

High expression of miR-223 is found in GR cells
Our previous study has demonstrated that miR-223
plays a pivotal role in regulation of cell growth, apoptosis,
migration and invasion in PC cells [25]. To define
whether miR-223 is involved in GR-induced EMT in PC

Inhibition of miR-223 reduces cell motility and
invasion in GR cells

whether Fbw7 plays a key role in GR-mediated EMT, we
measured the expression of Fbw7 at mRNA and protein
levels in GR cells and their parental cells using real-time
RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. We observed
that the expression of Fbw7 at mRNA and protein was
markedly decreased in GR cells compared with parental
cells (Figure 6A). Consistently, the expression of Fbw7
substrate Notch-1 was significantly increased (Figure 6A).
Moreover, we found that miR-223 inhibitor treatment led
to upregulation of Fbw7 in AsPC-1 GR and PANC-1 GR
cells (Figure 6B). Furthermore, Notch-1 expression was
downregulated in GR cells treated with miR-223 inhibitor
(Figure 6B). These findings indicated that the acquisition
of EMT could be in part due to down-regulation of Fbw7
and subsequent overexpression of Notch-1 in GR cells.

To further confirm the function of miR-223 in
GR cells, we measured the cell motility and invasion
capacities in GR cells treated with miR-223 inhibitor.
The wound healing assay demonstrated that miR-223
inhibitor reduced cell motility in GR cells (Figure 5A).
Consistent with this result, inhibition of miR-223
significantly retarded the migration and invasion in
GR cells (Figure 5B and 5C). Furthermore, miR-223
inhibitor treatment reduced the capacity of attachment
and detachment in GR cells (Figure 5D). These findings
revealed that miR-223 is critically involved in cell
migration and invasion characteristics in GR cells.
Altogether, our results revealed that miR-223 plays an
important role in regulation of EMT in GR cells.

Down-regulation of miR-223 enhances GR cells
to gemcitabine sensitivity

Downregulation of Fbw7 and overexpression of
Notch-1 were found in GR cells

To determine whether down-regulation of miR-223
enhances GR cells to gemcitabine sensitivity, we performed
MTT assay in GR cells treated with miR-223 inhibitor. We
observed that inhibition of miR-223 significantly attenuated
cell growth inhibition induced by 100μM gemcitabine

Recently, emerging evidence has demonstrated
that F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (Fbw7)
is one of miR-223 targets [26, 27]. To further define

in AsPC-1 GR and 5μM gemcitabine in PANC-1 GR,
respectively (Figure 6C). These results suggested that GR
cells with miR-223 inhibitor treatment were significantly
more sensitive to gemcitabine-induced cell growth inhibition.

Recent studies have highlighted the important role
of miRNAs in chemotherapy-induced EMT. For instance,
miR-489 regulated chemoresistance via EMT pathway
in breast cancer [38]. Moreover, it has been reported that
miR-134/487b/665 cluster governed transforming growth
factor-β (TGF-β)-mediated EMT and drug resistance to
gefitinib by targeting membrance associated guanylate
kinase inverted 2 (MAGI2) in lung cancer cells [39].
Furthermore, Shien et al. unraveled that acquired resistance
to EGFR inhibitors was associated with EMT features in
part due to downregulation of miR-200c in cancer cells [40].
Interestingly, miR-216a/217-induced EMT promoted drug
resistance via targeting phosphatase and tensin homolog
(PTEN) and mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 7
(SMAD7) in hepatocellular carcinoma [41]. In support of
the role of miRNAs in regulating chemotherapy-induced
EMT, our study identified that miR-223 could control
the GR-mediated EMT in PC cells. Recently, it has been
revealed that Fbw7 regulated EMT in non-small cell lung
cancers and enhanced cisplatin cytotoxicity [42]. In line
with this, we found the lower expression of Fbw7 in GR
cells with EMT phenotype, demonstrating that Fbw7 could
be involved in GR-induced EMT in PC cells. It has been
reported that Notch-1 induced EMT and was associated
with drug resistance in a variety of human cancers
including PC [43, 44]. Consistently, Notch-1 was highly
expressed in GR cells, indicating that Notch-1 could play
an important role in GR-induced EMT in PC cells.
In summary, our findings unraveled that GR
cells underwent EMT in part due to overexpression of
miR-223. Moreover, inhibition of miR-223 reversed
GR-induced EMT to MET. More importantly, miR-223
governs GR-induced EMT partly due to down-regulation
of its target Fbw7 and subsequent upregulation of
Notch-1 in PC. This study indicated that inactivation
of miR-223 could be a novel strategy for restoring
sensitivity to gemcitabine. Our previous study has shown
that natural agent genistein downregulated miR-223
expression, leading to inhibition of cell growth, migration
and invasion in PC cells [25]. Due to non-toxic nature,
inactivation of miR-223 by genistein could be a safer
approach for the treatment of PC.

DISCUSSION
A wealth of evidence has emerged that miR223 plays an oncogenic role in the development and
progression of human cancers. In support of the function
of miR-223, it has been observed that overexpression of
miR-223 was found and correlated with tumor metastasis
and poor prognosis in colorectal cancer patients [28, 29].
Moreover, upregulated miR-223 was also responsible for
the poorer prognosis of gastric cancer [30]. Strikingly,
p27 modulated miR-223 expression, leading to proper
regulation of cell cycle exit in breast cancer cells [31].
Notably, Huang et al. found that miR-223 promoted cell
growth and invasion by targeting tumor suppressor paired
box 6 (PAX6) in glioblastoma cels [32]. In line with these
reports, our previous study has also shown that inhibition
of miR-223 suppressed cell growth and induced apoptosis
in PC cells [25], indicating that miR-223 acted as an oncomiRNA in PC. Recently, a case-control study that included
409 patients with PC and 25 with chronic pancreatitis plus
312 healthy participants has identified that 38 miRNAs
including miR-223 were significantly dysregulated in PC
patients compared with controls [33]. Consistently, miR223 was found to be aberrantly upregulated in PC [34],
suggesting that miR-223 could be a novel biomarker for
detection of PC. In the current study, we, for the first time,
reported that miR-223 plays a crucial role in regulating
gemcitabine-induced EMT in PC cells, suggesting that
miR-223 could be a potential therapeutic target for PC.
A line of evidence has suggested that miR-223 was
associated with resistance to chemotherapeutic treatments.
For example, miR-223 was reported to be critically
involved in mutant p53-mediated drug resistance [35].
Mutant p53 proteins downregulated miR-223 expression
through binding to miR-223 promoter and reduced its
transcriptional activity and subsequently upregulated
stathmin-1 oncoprotein that is known to confer resistance
to chemotherapeutic drugs [35]. In line with this, Yang
et al. found that miR-223 modulated multidrug resistance
through downregulation of ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) in hepatocellular carcinoma
cells [36]. Overexpression of miR-223 increased sensitivity
to anticancer drugs, whereas downregulation of miR-223
had the opposite effect [36]. Similarly, upregulation of
miR-223 decreased the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells
to trastuzumab, while inhibition of miR-223 restored
this trastuzumab sensitivity through regulation of Fbw7
in gastric cancer [37]. In support of these findings, our
current study revealed that miR-223 was highly expressed
in gemcitabine resistant PC cells, demonstrating that miR223 is involved in drug resistance in PC.

The human pancreatic AsPC-1 and PANC-1 cells
were cultured in RPMI 1600 (Invitrogen,Carlsbad, CA,
USA) and DMEM (Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD, USA),
respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) in 5% CO2 at 37oC. AsPC-1 and PANC-1 cells were
exposed to escalating concentrations of gemcitabine for 6
months to create gemcitabine-resistant cell lines AsPC-1
GR and PANC-1 GR. MTT [3-(4,5-dimethythiazol- 2-yl)2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] was purchased from

Sigma (St. Louis, Mo, USA). Antibodies against Vimentin,
E-cadherin, Snail, Slug, ZEB1, ZEB2, Fbw7, β-actin and
the secondary antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Transwell inserts
and Matrigel were purchased from BD Biosciences.

The total RNA was obtained from cells using
Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA) following the
manufacturer’s protocol. The miR-223 expression was
analyzed using the TaqMan miRNA assays (Applied
Biosystems, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The expression level was normalized using
U6 snRNA levels. The expression of EMT associated
markers, such as E-cadherin, Snail, Slug, Vimentin, ZEB1
and ZEB2, was determined using SYBR green RT-PCR
assay (Takara,Dalian, China) and normalized to GAPDH
as previously published [48]. The primers used in PCR
reaction are described before [12, 46]

MTT assay
The cells were seeded into 96-well plates (5×103
cells/well) for overnight incubation. Then, cells were
treated with different final concentrations for 72h. MTT
assay was performed as described earlier [45].

Transwell migration and invasion assay
The transwell migration and invasion assays
were conducted using a 24-well plate with 8-mm pore
size chamber inserts (Corning, New York, NY, USA) as
described previously [46]. Briefly, the invasion assay was
performed using Transwell inserts precoated with Matrigel
(BD Biosciences), while the migration assay used noncoated inserts. Cells were seeded into the upper chamber
of the insert, which were suspended in serum-free culture
medium. Then, medium with 10% fetal bovine serum was
added into the lower chamber. After incubation for 24h, the
cells in upper chamber were carefully scraped with cotton
buds. The migrated and invaded cells on the bottom surface
of chambers were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20
min, and stained with Giemsa solution. The stained cells
were imaged and counted in 5 fields with random choice.

Western blotting analysis
The cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed
with RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors.
The protein concentrations were detected using the
BCA protein assay. The proteins were separated using
SDS–PAGE electrophoresis and transferred to PVDF
membranes. The membranes were then blocked with 5%
nonfat milk and immunoblotted with antibodies as early
published [49].

miRNA-223 inhibitor tranfection
The cells were seeded in six-well plates and
transfected with miR-223 inhibitor or the nonspecific
control (GenePharma, shanghai, china) using DharmaFect
Transfection Reagent (Dharmacon, CO) following the
manufacture’s protocol [47]. MiR-223 inhibitor: 5′-UGG
GGU AUU UGA CAA ACU GAC A-3′. The cells were
subjected to further analysis as presented under the results
section.

Wound healing assay
The cells were seeded in 6-well plates until the cells
reached to more than 95% confluence. Then, the wounded
scrape was made using a pipette tip and the consequently
generated floating cells were removed using PBS. The
wound healing was photographed at 0 hour and 20 hours
as described before [47].

Statistical analysis
Statistical comparisons were analyzed by Student’s
t-test using GraphPad Prism 4.0 (Graph pad Software, La
Jolla, CA) because we only compared with two different
groups. The results were presented as means ± SEM.
P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Cell attachment and detachment assay
Cell attachment and detachment assays were
performed as previously described [13]. Briefly, the
cells were seeded in 24-well plate (5×104 cells/well). For
attachment assay, after one hour incubation, non-attached
cells were washed twice with PBS, and the attached cells
were counted after trypsinization. The attachment data
were quantified as a percentage of cell numbers of the
attached cells to total cells. For detachment assay, the
cells were detached with 0.05% trypsin for 3 minutes and
counted after the seeded cells were incubated 24 hours.
The remaining attached cells were further trypsinized
with 0.25% trypsin and counted. Cells detachment data
were expressed as a percentage of the detached cells to
total cells.
