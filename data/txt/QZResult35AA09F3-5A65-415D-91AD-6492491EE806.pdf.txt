Abstract
Withaferin A (WA) is derived from the medicinal plant
Withania somnifera, which has been safely used for centuries
in Indian Ayurvedic medicine for treatment of different
ailments. We now show, for the first time, that WA exhibits
significant activity against human breast cancer cells in
culture and in vivo. The WA treatment decreased viability
of MCF-7 (estrogen-responsive) and MDA-MB-231 (estrogenindependent) human breast cancer cells in a concentrationdependent manner. The WA-mediated suppression of
breast cancer cell viability correlated with apoptosis induction characterized by DNA condensation, cytoplasmic
histone–associated DNA fragmentation, and cleavage of
poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase. On the other hand, a spontaneously immortalized normal mammary epithelial cell
line (MCF-10A) was relatively more resistant to WA-induced
apoptosis compared with breast cancer cells. The WAmediated apoptosis was accompanied by induction of Bim-s
and Bim-L in MCF-7 cells and induction of Bim-s and
Bim-EL isoforms in MDA-MB-231 cells. The cytoplasmic
histone–associated DNA fragmentation resulting from WA
exposure was significantly attenuated by knockdown of
protein levels of Bim and its transcriptional regulator
FOXO3a in both cell lines. Moreover, FOXO3a knockdown
conferred marked protection against WA-mediated induction
of Bim-s expression. The growth of MDA-MB-231 cells
implanted in female nude mice was significantly retarded
by 5 weekly i.p. injections of 4 mg WA/kg body weight.
The tumors from WA-treated mice exhibited reduced cell
proliferation and increased apoptosis compared with tumors
from control mice. These results point toward an important
role of FOXO3a and Bim in regulation of WA-mediated
apoptosis in human breast cancer cells. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Breast cancer continues to be a leading cause of cancerrelated deaths in women worldwide despite significant advances
in screening techniques leading to early detection of the disease
(1). The known risk factors for breast cancer include family
history, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, atypical hyperplasia of the breast,
late age at first full-term pregnancy, early menarche, and late
menopause (2–4). Because some of these risk factors are not

easily modifiable (e.g., genetic predisposition), other strategies for
reduction of the breast cancer risk must be considered. Although
selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulators (e.g., tamoxifen)
seem promising for prevention of breast cancer, this strategy is
largely ineffective against ER-negative breast cancers (5, 6).
Moreover, selective ER modulators have serious side effects
including increased risk of uterine cancer, thromboembolism,
cataracts, and perimenopausal symptoms (5, 6). Therefore, novel
agents for prevention and treatment of human breast cancers,
especially hormone-independent breast cancers, are highly
desirable. Natural products have received increasing attention
in recent years for the discovery of novel cancer preventive and
therapeutic agents (7).
Withaferin A (WA) is a bioactive compound derived from the
medicinal plant Withania somnifera (commonly known as
ashwagandha or Indian winter cherry), which has been safely
used for centuries in the Indian Ayurvedic medicine practice for
the treatment of various ailments (8–13). Ashwagandha is also
recommended as a tonic for overall well-being (13) and the
extract of Withania somnifera L. is available over the counter in
the United States as a dietary supplement. The known
pharmacologic effects of Withania somnifera extract include
modulation of immune function (8), cardioprotection from ischemia
and reperfusion injury (9), protection of 6-hydroxydopamine–
induced Parkinsonism in rats (10), antibacterial effects (11), and
anti-inflammatory effects (12). Crude ethanol extract of Withania
somnifera suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced production of
inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-a,
interleukin-1h, and interleukin-12 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (14). Extract of Withania somnifera as well as WA
potently inhibited nuclear factor-nB activation (14–16). The WA
was shown to be a radiosensitizer and suppressor of mouse
Ehrlich ascites carcinoma growth (17–20). More recent studies
have shown that WA suppresses growth of human cancer cells by
causing apoptosis (21–23), but the mechanism of proapoptotic
response to WA is poorly understood. Suppression of angiogenesis, alteration of cytoskeletal architecture, and inhibition
of proteasomal activity by WA has also been documented
(21, 24, 25).
The present study was undertaken to determine efficacy of WA
against human breast cancer cells. We show that WA exhibits
significant growth inhibitory effect against MCF-7 (estrogenresponsive) and MDA-MB-231 (estrogen-independent) human
breast cancer cell lines in association with apoptosis induction.
The WA-mediated apoptosis in breast cancer cells is regulated by
FOXO3a and its transcriptional target Bim. In addition, WA
administration significantly retards growth of MDA-MB-231 cells
in vivo, which correlates with reduced cell proliferation and
increased apoptosis in the tumor mass. The results of the present
study merit clinical investigation to determine efficacy of WA
against human breast cancers.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. The WA was purchased from ChromaDex. DMSO, 4’,6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and cremophor-EL were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. The cell culture medium, antibiotic mixture, and fetal bovine
serum were purchased from Invitrogen or Mediatech. The antibodies
against Bax, Bak, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP), and
Bim were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; the antiactin antibody was from
Sigma; the antibodies against Bcl-2 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA) were from DakoCytomation; and anti-FOXO3a antibody was from
Upstate Biotechnology. The ApopTag Plus Peroxidase In situ Apoptosis
detection kit was from Chemicon International-Millipore.
Cell culture and cell viability assay. The MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and
MCF-10A cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection and maintained as described by us previously (26). The MDAMB-231 cell line stably expressing firefly luciferase (MDA-MB-231-lucD3H1) was purchased from Caliper Life Sciences and maintained as

recommended by the provider. Each cell line was maintained at 37jC in an
atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. The effect of WA treatment on viability
of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells was determined by trypan blue dye
exclusion assay as described by us previously (27).
Determination of apoptosis. The proapoptotic effect of WA was
assessed by fluorescence microscopy after staining the cells with DAPI and
quantification of cytoplasmic histone–associated DNA fragmentation. The
DAPI assay was performed essentially as described by us previously (27).
Quantitation of cytoplasmic histone–associated DNA fragmentation was
performed using a kit from Roche Applied Science according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations.
Immunoblotting. Desired cells (1  106) were seeded in 100-mm
culture dishes, allowed to attach by overnight incubation, and treated
with DMSO (control) or 2.5 and 5.0 Amol/L WA for specified time periods.
The cell lysate was prepared as described by us previously (28). The cell
lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min. The
lysate proteins were resolved by 10% or 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred
onto polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The membrane was incubated
with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk. The
membrane was then treated with the desired primary antibody for 1 h at
room temperature or overnight at 4jC. After treatment with the
appropriate secondary antibody, the immunoreactive bands were
visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence method. The blots
were stripped and reprobed with antiactin antibody to normalize for
differences in protein loading. Change in the level of desired protein was
determined by densitometric scanning of the immunoreactive band and
corrected for actin loading control. Immunoblotting for each protein was
performed at least twice using independently prepared lysates to ensure
reproducibility of the results.
RNA interference. A control nonspecific siRNA (UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACG UdTdT) was purchased from Qiagen. The Bim- and FOXO3a-targeted
siRNAs were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (29). The sequences
of the Bim- and FOXO3a-targeted siRNAs are not revealed by the
manufacturer. The cells were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected at
50% confluency with 200 nmol/L of control nonspecific siRNA, Bim-targeted
siRNA, or FOXO3a-specific siRNA using OligofectAMINE according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells
were treated with DMSO (control) or 5 Amol/L WA for 24 h. The cells were
then collected and processed for immunoblotting and analysis of
cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation.
Xenograft studies. Eight-week-old female nude (nu/nu) mice were
purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley and acclimated for 1 wk before start
of the experiment. For subcutaneous xenograft study, the mice were
randomized into two groups of eight mice per group. The mice were injected
i.p. with either vehicle (10% DMSO, 40% cremophor-EL, and 50% PBS) or
vehicle containing 4 mg WA/kg body weight on Monday through Friday for
2.5 wk before the tumor cell injection to mimic a prevention protocol.
Exponentially growing MDA-MB-231 cells were suspended in PBS and mixed
in a 1:1 ratio with Matrigel. A 0.1-mL suspension containing
2.5  106 cells was injected s.c. on both left and right flank of each mouse
above the hind limb. Tumor volume and body weights were recorded as
described by us previously (30–32). For the orthotopic model, 8-wk-old female
nude mice were randomized into two groups (n = 5) and treated
i.p. with the vehicle or 4 mg WA/kg body weight on Monday through Friday
for 2 wk as described above. Exponentially growing MDA-MB-231-luc-D3H1
cells (f2.5  106) mixed with Matrigel (1:1 ratio) were injected into the
mammary fat pad of each mouse. Tumor size was measured by
bioluminescence imaging using a Xenogen IVIS 200 system (Caliper
Life Sciences). For imaging, mice were administrated i.p. with 150 mg
D-luciferin/kg body weight (Caliper Life Sciences) 15 min before determination of the bioluminescence. Subsequently, the mice were anesthetized with
1% to 3% isoflurane and placed onto the warmed stage inside the light-tight
camera box. The photons emitted by the bioluminescent tumor
cells were detected by the IVIS camera system, integrated, and digitized.
Regions of interest (ROI) from displayed images were identified around the
tumor sites and quantified as total photon count/s using Living Image
software (Caliper Life Sciences). A pseudocolor bioluminescent image from

buffered formalin, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at
4- to 5-Am thickness. Representative tumor sections from control and
WA-treated mice were processed for H&E staining and immunohistochemical analysis of PCNA expression. Immunohistochemical analysis of PCNA
expression was performed as described by us previously (32). At least three
nonoverlapping representative images of each tissue were captured from
each section using the camera attached to the microscope. The images were
analyzed using Image ProPlus 5.0 software (Media Cybernetics) for
quantitation of PCNA expression.
Detection of apoptotic bodies by terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase–mediated dUTP nick-end labeling. The paraffin-embedded
tissue sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and then used to visualize
apoptotic cells by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP
nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining using the ApopTag Plus Peroxidase
In Situ Apoptosis kit and following the manufacturer’s protocol. Apoptotic
bodies in the tumor sections were quantified by counting the number of
TUNEL-positive cells in at least three randomly selected, nonoverlapping
high-power (magnification, 200) fields on each sample.
Statistical analysis. Statistical significance of difference in measured
variables between control and WA-treated groups was determined by oneway ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s or Bonferroni’s test or t test. Difference
was considered significant at a P value of <0.05.

WA treatment decreased survival of cultured human breast
cancer cells. We determined the effect of WA treatment (refer to
Fig. 1A for chemical structure of WA) on viability of MCF-7 and
MDA-MB-231 cells, which, respectively, are well-characterized
representatives of estrogen-responsive and estrogen-independent
human breast cancers. The MCF-7 cell line, which is ER positive,
was isolated from pleural effusion of a stage IV invasive ductal
carcinoma. The MCF-7 cells are aneuploid with high chromosomal
instability and defective for the G1 and mitotic spindle checkpoint
but express normal p53 (reviewed in ref. 33). The MDA-MB-231 cell
line, which was derived from a stage IV invasive ductal carcinoma,
is ER-negative, partially proficient for all cell cycle checkpoints,
and expresses mutant p53 (33). Survival of MCF-7 (Fig. 1B) and
MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 1C) was decreased significantly after a
24-hour exposure to WA in a concentration-dependent manner
with an IC50 of <2 Amol/L. These results indicated that WA
suppressed survival of human breast cancer cells regardless of their
estrogen responsiveness or p53 status.
WA treatment caused apoptosis in cultured human breast
cancer cells. Antiproliferative effect of many naturally occurring
cancer chemopreventive agents, including garlic-derived organosulfur compounds, cruciferous vegetable–derived isothiocyanates,
and constituents of alternative and complementary medicine
(e.g., honokiol and guggulsterone), is tightly linked to their ability
to cause apoptosis (26, 27, 34, 35). We raised the question of
whether the WA-mediated suppression of MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 cell viability was due to apoptosis induction. We addressed this
question by determining the effect of WA treatment on cytoplasmic
histone–associated DNA fragmentation, which is a well-accepted
technique for quantitation of apoptosis. As can be seen in Fig. 2A,
WA treatment increased cytoplasmic histone–associated DNA
fragmentation over DMSO-treated control in both cell lines in a
concentration- and time-dependent manner. For example, the
cytoplasmic histone–associated DNA fragmentation resulting from
a 24-, 36-, and 48-h exposure of MCF-7 cells to 2.5 Amol/L WA was
increased by f2.1-, 7.3-, and 6.4-fold, respectively, compared with
DMSO-treated control (Fig. 2A). We confirmed proapoptotic effect
of WA by DAPI assay, which is another widely used technique for

detection of apoptosis. The DAPI assay revealed abundance of cells
with condensed and fragmented DNA in WA-treated MCF-7 and
MDA-MB-231 cultures, which were rare in DMSO-treated controls
(data not shown). Apoptotic cells with condensed and fragmented
DNA (DAPI assay) were scored from control (DMSO-treated)
and WA-treated (2.5 and 5 Amol/L WA) cultures of MCF-7 and
MDA-MB-231 cells. The percentage of apoptotic cells was increased
by f25- and 30-fold upon a 24-hour treatment of MDA-MB-231
cells with 2.5 and 5 Amol/L WA, respectively, compared with
DMSO-treated control. Consistent with these results, the WA
treatment caused cleavage of PARP in MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 2B)
and MCF-7 cells (data not shown). These results indicated that
WA treatment caused apoptotic cell death in both MCF-7 and
MDA-MB-231 cell lines.
Next, we addressed the question of whether proapoptotic effect
of WA was selective toward cancer cells using a nontumorigenic
normal mammary epithelial cell line (MCF-10A). The MCF-10A cell
line was isolated from fibrocystic breast disease and was

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (18). September 15, 2008

spontaneously immortalized (33). The MCF-10A cells have intact
cell cycle checkpoints and normal proliferation controls (33). As
can be seen in Fig. 2C, the MCF-10A cell line was relatively more
resistant to WA-mediated cytoplasmic histone–associated DNA
fragmentation compared with MDA-MB-231 or MCF-7 cells
(Fig. 2A). For example, a statistically significant increase in
cytoplasmic histone–associated DNA fragmentation over DMSOtreated control in MCF-10A cells was observed at 10 Amol/L WA
concentration (Fig. 2C), whereas lower concentrations of WA were
proapoptotic in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 2A). Collectively, these results indicated that the human breast cancer cells
were relatively more sensitive to apoptosis induction by WA
compared with a normal mammary epithelial cell line.
WA treatment altered levels of Bcl-2 family proteins in
breast cancer cells. The Bcl-2 family proteins play critical roles
in regulation of apoptosis by functioning as either promoters
(e.g., Bax and Bak) or inhibitors (e.g., Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) of the
cell death (36, 37). To gain insight into the mechanism of

FOXO3a and Bim in Withaferin A–Induced Apoptosis

WA-mediated apoptosis, we determined its effect on expression of
Bcl-2 family proteins by immunoblotting (Fig. 3). The WA
treatment caused a modest increase in the protein levels of Bak
in both MCF-7 (Fig. 3A) and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3B) and
Bax in MCF-7 cells (up to 2.7-fold increase compared with
DMSO-treated control). The WA-treated MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
cells exhibited modest induction of Bcl-2 protein levels at 6- to
12-hour time points, especially at 5 Amol/L concentration,
followed by a decline in its expression 24-hour postexposure
(f50–90% decrease relative to DMSO-treated control). Exposure
of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells to WA also resulted in induction
of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 protein levels as well as Mcl-1 cleavage to a
32-kDa intermediate in both cell lines (Fig. 3A and B). However,
the most conspicuous effect of WA treatment was induction of
Bim isoforms in both cells. In MCF-7 cells, the WA treatment
caused a dose-dependent and marked increase in the protein
levels of short and long forms of Bim (Bim-s and Bim-L,
respectively; Fig. 3A). The WA-treated MDA-MD-231 cells
exhibited induction of protein levels of Bim-s as well as extra
long form (Bim-EL) of the protein (Fig. 3B). Together, these
results indicated that WA treatment caused an increase in the
levels of both proapoptotic (Bak, Bax, and Bim) and antiapoptotic

(Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1) Bcl-2 family proteins in human breast
cancer cells.
Bim knockdown conferred protection against WA-mediated
apoptosis in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Because WA
treatment caused a marked increase in the protein levels of Bim
isoforms in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, we proceeded to
determine their contribution to regulation of WA-induced apoptosis using siRNA technology. Transient transfection of MDA-MB-231
cells with a Bim-targeted siRNA resulted in >90% knockdown of
Bim-EL protein (Fig. 4A, lane 2, inset) compared with cells
transiently transfected with a control nonspecific siRNA (Fig. 4A,
lane 1, inset). The Bim-L or Bim-s isoforms were undetectable
because their constitutive expression is very low in control
(untreated) MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3B). Consistent with the
results in untransfected MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 2A), a 24-hour
exposure of nonspecific siRNA–transfected MDA-MB-231 cells
to 5 Amol/L WA resulted in statistically significant increase
in cytoplasmic histone–associated DNA fragmentation compared
with DMSO-treated control (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, the
WA-mediated increase in cytoplasmic histone–associated DNA
fragmentation was not evident in MDA-MB-231 cells with
knockdown of Bim-EL protein. Similarly, knockdown of Bim-EL

protein level by transient transfection of MCF-7 cells with the
Bim-targeted siRNA conferred partial yet significant protection
against WA-mediated cytoplasmic histone–associated DNA fragmentation compared with cells transfected with a control
nonspecific siRNA (Fig. 4B). The protective effect of Bim-EL
knockdown on WA-mediated apoptosis was relatively more
pronounced in MDA-MB-231 cells (complete protection) than in
the MCF-7 cell line (partial protection), which may be attributable
to a greater knockdown of the Bim-EL in the former cell line
compared with MCF-7 cells (compare lane 2 in the insets of
Fig. 4A and B). Nonetheless, these results indicated that induction
of Bim isoforms was a critical event in WA-mediated apoptosis in
human breast cancer cells.
Studies have indicated that the expression of Bim is regulated
by FOXO3a (also known as FKHR-L1) transcription factor (38). We
designed experiments to test whether the WA-mediated induction
of Bim in our model was regulated by FOXO3a. As can be seen in
Fig. 4C, the protein level of FOXO3a was decreased by >90% upon
transient transfection of MCF-7 cells with a FOXO3a-targeted
siRNA compared with the cells transfected with a control
nonspecific siRNA (Fig. 4C, compare lanes 1 and 2, inset). The
FOXO3a protein depletion also conferred partial yet significant
protection against WA-mediated cytoplasmic histone–associated
DNA fragmentation when compared with MCF-7 cells transfected
with the control nonspecific siRNA (Fig. 4C). A similar protection
against WA-mediated cytoplasmic histone–associated DNA fragmentation by knockdown of FOXO3a protein level was also
observed in the MDA-MB-231 cell line (data not shown). In
addition, the WA-mediated induction of Bim-s in MCF-7 cells
(Fig. 4D ) and MDA-MB-231 cells (data not shown) was

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (18). September 15, 2008

markedly abrogated by siRNA-based knockdown of FOXO3a
protein level. These results indicated that the WA-mediated
induction of Bim-s in breast cancer cells was FOXO3a dependent.
Because FOXO3a knockdown did not have a noticeable effect on
Bim-EL protein level (Fig. 4D, top band), it is reasonable to
conclude that the expression of Bim-EL isoform is not regulated by
FOXO3a at least in breast cancer cells.
WA administration retarded growth of MDA-MB-231 xenografts in female nude mice. To test in vivo significance of the
cellular observations, we determined the effect of WA administration on MDA-MB-231 xenograft growth. The dose and route of WA
administration was selected from a previous study documenting
in vivo efficacy of WA against prostate cancer cells (22). As can be
seen in Fig. 5A, the average body weights of the control and
WA-treated mice did not differ significantly throughout the study.
Moreover, the WA-treated mice otherwise seemed healthy and did
not exhibit signs of distress such as impaired movement or posture,
indigestion, and areas of redness or swelling. The average tumor
volume in WA-treated mice was significantly lower compared with
control mice on every week of tumor measurement starting with
week 6 (Fig. 5B). For example, on week 10, the average tumor
volume in control mice (1,029 F 164 mm3) was f1.8-fold higher
compared with WA-treated mice (P < 0.05). Consistent with tumor
volume data, the average wet weight of the tumor was significantly
lower in WA-treated mice compared with control mice (Fig. 5C).
These results indicated that WA administration significantly
inhibited MDA-MB-231 xenograft growth in female nude without
causing weight loss. We also tested the efficacy of WA against
MDA-MB-231-luc-D3H1 cells directly injected into the mammary
fat pad of female nude mice. Bioluminescence images for

FOXO3a and Bim in Withaferin A–Induced Apoptosis

representative mouse of control and WA-treated group at 12 weeks
after beginning of the study are shown in Fig. 5D. The average
bioluminescence signal strength obtained at 12 weeks after the
start of the study for the WA-treated mice was markedly lower
compared with that of control mice. Similar to the subcutaneous
xenograft study (Fig. 5A), the average body weights of the control
and WA-treated mice did not differ significantly in the orthotopic
study (data not shown). Collectively, these results indicated that
WA treatment inhibited growth of MDA-MB-231 cells s.c. and
orthotopically implanted in female nude mice.
WA administration decreased cell proliferation and
increased apoptosis in tumors. To test whether WA-mediated
inhibition of MDA-MB-231 xenograft growth in vivo was associated
with reduced cell proliferation and/or increased apoptosis, tumor
tissues from control and WA-treated mice were processed for H&E
staining, immunohistochemical analysis of PCNA expression, and
TUNEL assay. Data from a representative mouse of each group are
shown in Fig. 6A. The H&E staining revealed a relatively higher
nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio in the tumors from control mice
compared with WA-treated mice. The WA-mediated reduction in
cellular proliferation in vivo in the tumor was confirmed by
immunohistochemical analysis for PCNA expression. The PCNA is

a marker for cellular proliferation and is expressed in >90% of
in situ and invasive breast carcinomas (39). The PCNA expression
was f50% lower in tumors from WA-treated mice compared with
control tumors (Fig. 6B). The proapoptotic effect of WA treatment
in vivo was visualized by TUNEL staining (Fig. 6A). The tumors
from the WA-treated mice exhibited a significantly higher count of
apoptotic bodies per high-power field compared with control
tumors (Fig. 6C). Collectively, these results indicated that WA
administration caused suppression of cellular proliferation and
increased apoptosis in the tumor in vivo.

Discussion
The present study shows that WA treatment exhibits significant
antiproliferative activity against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human
breast cancer cells in culture and the MDA-MB-231 cells in vivo
implanted in female nude mice. The WA-mediated suppression of
breast cancer cell growth correlates with increased apoptosis both
in cultured breast cancer cells and in the tumor tissues harvested
from mice. Because WA treatment suppresses growth and causes
apoptosis in both MCF-7 (estrogen responsive) and MDA-MB-231
cells (estrogen independent), it is reasonable to conclude that the
above cellular responses to WA are not influenced by the estrogen

responsiveness. Similarly, the p53 protein, which plays an
important role in apoptotic response to various stimuli (40), is
not necessary for WA-mediated apoptosis because this agent is
able to cause cell death in wild-type p53-expressing MCF-7 cells as
well as in MDA-MB-231 cells containing mutant p53. Nonetheless,
it is possible that proapoptotic response to WA is intensified by the
presence of wild-type p53 because the MCF-7 cell line seems
relatively more sensitive to WA-induced apoptosis compared with
the MDA-MB-231 cell line based on quantitation of cytoplasmic
histone–associated DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2A). However, further
studies are needed to systematically explore this possibility.
The present study also indicates that a spontaneously immortalized and nontumorigenic normal mammary epithelial cell line
(MCF-10A) is relatively more resistant to WA-induced apoptosis
compared with MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. These results are
significant because selectivity toward cancer cells is a highly
desirable feature of potential cancer chemopreventive and
therapeutic agents.
We raised the question of whether WA treatment caused growth
arrest independent of apoptosis in breast cancer cells. We have
addressed this question by determining the effect of WA treatment
on cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry using MDA-MB-231
and MCF-7 cells.1 We found that WA exposure caused a dosedependent G2-M phase cell cycle arrest as early as 8 hours after
treatment in both cell lines.1 Although significant increase in
subdiploid fraction (a measure of apoptotic cells) was not observed
until 24 hours after treatment, the G2-M arrest was maintained in
WA-treated cells (2 Amol/L for 24 hours) even after their culture in
drug-free medium for 24 hours.1 At the same time, a 24-hour
culture of WA-treated cells in drug-free medium also resulted in an
increase in subdiploid fraction. Based on these results, we conclude
that a fraction of G2-M arrested cells in WA-treated cell cultures are
probably driven to apoptotic cell death.
The present study reveals that the WA-mediated apoptosis in
MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells correlates with an increase in
expression of both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family
proteins (Fig. 3). The most noticeable effect is evident on protein
levels of Bim isoforms in both cell lines, although with different
specificity. Bim is a BH-3 only member of the Bcl-2 family that
is transcriptionally up-regulated in cells undergoing apoptosis
(41–43). Three alternative splice variants of Bim have been
described (44). The short form of Bim (Bim-s) potently induces
apoptosis, whereas the apoptotic activity of the Bim-L and BimEL is suppressed by binding to the dynein motor complex (45).
The Bim-L and Bim-EL bind to dynein light chain through a short
peptide motif (DKSTQTP) that is absent in Bim-s (45). The
WA treatment causes induction of Bim-L and Bim-s isoforms in
MCF-7 cells and induction of Bim-EL and Bim-s variants in the

MDA-MB-231 cell line. The WA-mediated induction of Bim-s
is relatively more pronounced in the MCF-7 cell line than in
MDA-MB-231, which could also account for relatively greater
sensitivity of the former cell line to apoptosis induction by
WA compared with the MDA-MB-231 cell line. The WA-mediated
apoptosis in both cell lines is significantly attenuated by
knockdown of Bim protein (Fig. 4A and B). The partial protection
conferred by transient transfection of Bim siRNA in MCF-7
cells against WA-induced cytoplasmic histone–associated DNA
fragmentation may be due to incomplete knockdown of the
protein. The proapoptotic activity of Bim is regulated at multiple
levels including transcriptional and posttranslational modifications (46). For example, FOXO3a has been implicated in
transcriptional regulation of Bim (38). We also found that
the WA-mediated induction of Bim-s, but not Bim-EL, is regulated
by FOXO3a in our model because knockdown of this protein
not only abrogates WA-mediated induction of Bim-s (Fig. 4D)
but also protects against apoptosis (Fig. 4C). Based on these
results, it is reasonable to conclude that the FOXO3a-Bim
pathway plays an important role in regulation of WA-induced
apoptosis.
Because preclinical in vivo efficacy testing of potential cancer
therapeutic/preventive agents is a key step in their clinical
development, we determined the effect of WA administration on
growth of MDA-MB-231 cells s.c. and orthotopically implanted in
female nude mice. We found that i.p. administration of WA delays
growth of MDA-MB-231 xenografts in both models. Inhibition of
PC-3 prostate cancer cell growth in male nude mice by WA
treatment has also been observed (22). Consistent with the results
of cellular studies, the WA-mediated suppression of MDA-MB-231
xenograft growth correlates with reduced cellular proliferation, as
shown by H&E staining and PCNA expression, and increased
apoptosis as revealed by TUNEL assay. Thus, apoptosis induction is
a critical mechanism in WA-mediated suppression of MDA-MB-231
cell growth in vivo.
In conclusion, the results of the present study show that WA
treatment suppresses survival of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells in
culture and retards growth of MDA-MB-231 xenografts in vivo in
association with reduced cellular proliferation and increased
apoptosis. The WA-mediated apoptosis in both cell lines is
mediated, at least in part, by FOXO3a and Bim.
