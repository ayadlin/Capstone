Abstract
The reduction in the normal level of tissue oxygen tension or
hypoxia is a characteristic of solid tumors that triggers the
activation of signaling pathways promoting neovascularization, metastasis, increased tumor growth, and resistance to
treatments. The activation of the transcription factor hypoxiainducible factor 1A (HIF-1A) has been identified as the master
mechanism of adaptation to hypoxia. In a recent study, we
identified the sphingosine kinase 1/sphingosine 1-phosphate
(SphK1/S1P) pathway, which elicits various cellular processes
including cell proliferation, cell survival, or angiogenesis, as a
new modulator of HIF-1A activity under hypoxic conditions.
Here, we consider how the SphK1/S1P signaling pathway
could represent a very important target for therapeutic
intervention in cancer. [Cancer Res 2009;69(9):3723–6]

Background
Hypoxia, the lack of oxygen in which oxygen delivery does not
meet demand, is a characteristic hallmark of locally advanced solid
tumors. Indeed, it has been estimated that up to 50% to 60%
of solid tumors contain areas of hypoxic tissues as a consequence
of an imbalance between oxygen supply and consumption in
proliferating tumors because the developing new blood vessels are
aberrant and have poor blood flow (1). Even though hypoxia
is toxic to both cancer and normal cells, cancer cells undergo
adaptive changes that allow them to survive and proliferate
by activating pathways that stimulate angiogenesis to increase
oxygen supply and by activating metabolic pathways that permit adaptation to the reduced oxygen accessibility (2). These
mechanisms contributing to a malignant phenotype characterized
by relentless tumor expansion, increased risk of metastasis,
angiogenesis, and development of resistance to therapies, are
coordinated transcriptionally by the hypoxia-inducible factors
HIF-1, HIF-2, and HIF-3 transcription factors. HIF-1 has been
identified as the master regulator of the response of mammalian
cells to hypoxia. HIF-1 is a heterodimeric transcription factor,
composed of a constitutively expressed nuclear h subunit (also
called ARNT1) and an oxygen sensitive a subunit (3). Under welloxygenated conditions, the posttranslational hydroxylation of one
or two prolyl residues of HIF-1a is mediated by members of the
oxygen-dependent specific prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) family
(4). The hydroxylation of HIF-1a is required for its recognition by
the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene product (pVHL) of
the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, followed by its ubiquination and

proteasomal degradation. Under low oxygen conditions or in cells
lacking functional pVHL (renal cell carcinomas and other tumors
regrouped in the VHL syndrome), HIF-1a remains unhydroxylated,
and therefore accumulates, then translocates to the nucleus where
it heterodimerizes with its partner HIF-1h. The binding of the
heterodimeric HIF-1 to hypoxia response elements (HREs) located
in the promoter region of its numerous target genes like those
encoding angiogenesis-promoting factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or platelet-derived growth factor,
glucose transporters, enzymes of glycolytic pathway, in addition
to proteins involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, cell
proliferation, or survival (5) leads toward a surviving phenotype
with clinical aggressiveness.
Overwhelming evidence based on immunohistochemical studies
of human tumor sections indicates that HIF-1a is overexpressed
in the majority of human cancers. In most cases, there is a direct
correlation between the degree of expression of HIF-1a or some of
its prominent and specific downstream targets such as the glucose
transporter GLUT-1 or the carbonic anhydrase IX and poor clinical
outcomes: poor response to radiation and chemotherapy, more
aggressive and invasive tumors, and increased patient mortality (1).
In preclinical models, HIF-1a overexpression is an accelerating
factor in tumor progression and metastasis (6), whereas inhibition
of HIF-1a activity impedes tumor growth and angiogenesis (7),
supporting proof-of-principle that HIF-1a inhibitors could have
therapeutic benefit.

When the Sphingosine Kinase 1/Sphingosine
1-Phosphate Pathway Meets Hypoxia Signaling
Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a potent lipid mediator
regulating a broad variety of cellular processes such as cell
proliferation, apoptosis, calcium homeostasis, vascular maturation,
or angiogenesis (8). S1P content in cells is low and strictly kept
under control by a tightly regulated balance between its synthesis
and its degradation. The balance between the intracellular levels
of S1P and its metabolic precursors ceramide and sphingosine
is regarded as a switch that could determine whether a cell
proliferates or dies (9). A decisive regulator of this sphingolipid
rheostat is the sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1), which generates
S1P from its metabolic precursor sphingosine. SphK1 activity can
be rapidly stimulated by many agonists (e.g., growth factors such
as PDGF, FGF, EGF, HGF, VEGF, etc.), thus reflecting its critical
role in controling S1P levels. Once generated, S1P can act either
extracellularly by binding to one of the five cell surface G-coupled
S1P receptors to drive paracrine or autocrine signaling cascades or
intracellularly by a mechanism still unknown (8). Importantly, the
agonist-induced S1P production as well as its downstream effects
can be impeded by inhibition of the SphK1 gene expression or
enzymatic activity demonstrating that SphK1 plays a crucial role in
the observed effects ascribed to S1P. Multiple studies support the

Figure 1. Regulation of HIF-1a level by the SphK1/S1P signaling pathway in cancer cells subjected to hypoxia. Under low oxygen tension (1% CO2), SphK1 activity
is quickly but transiently stimulated by an unknown mechanism relying on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. S1P, either intracellularly or through the binding
to one of its G-coupled receptor (S1PRs), triggers activation of the Akt/GSK3h signaling that regulates HIF-1a level. Inhibition of the SphK1 gene expression or
enzymatic activity causes the down-regulation of the Akt/GSK3h signaling leading to the degradation of HIF-1a by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein
(pVHL)-mediated ubiquitin proteasome machinery.

convincing role of SphK1 in the promotion of oncogenesis in
addition to being a cellular target for many anticancer treatments.
On the one hand, since the demonstration of its oncogenic nature,
SphK1 expression has been found up-regulated in a number of
solid tumors, and high SphK1 expression in glioblastoma and
breast cancer has been correlated with poor survival of patients
(10). On the other hand, anticancer regimens (chemotherapies,
radiation therapy) have been shown to down-regulate SphK1
activity in various cancer cell and animal models, suggesting that
SphK1 could act as a ‘‘sensor’’ to anticancer therapies, whereas its
enforced expression can protect cancer cells from apoptosis (10).
Accumulating evidence has implicated the S1P metabolism in
hypoxia in normal cells. Indeed, we and others have shown the
involvement of SphK1 in the adaptation of cardiomyocytes to
ischemia both in vitro and in animal models (11, 12), and SphK1null cardiomyocytes have been shown to be more susceptible to
hypoxia (13). Moreover, increased proliferation of smooth muscle
cells induced by hypoxia relies on the generation of S1P (14), and
increased SphK1 expression was reported in pulmonary smooth
muscle cells under both acute and chronic hypoxia (15).
Unexpectedly, given the significance of hypoxia in cancer, the
association between the SphK1/S1P signaling and adaptation to

hypoxic conditions was only investigated very recently in tumor
cells. Indeed, we have shown for the first time that SphK1 could
regulate HIF-1a accumulation under low oxygen tension (16). Done
in five distinct tumor cell models (glioblastoma, prostate, breast,
lung, kidney), our studies suggest a canonical role for SphK1 in
cancer adaptation to hypoxia. A sharp stimulation of SphK1
activity occurred rapidly (within 1-2 hours) but transiently under
hypoxic conditions indicating a likely posttraductional effect, with
SphK1 activation invariably preceding HIF-1a accumulation.
Interestingly, SphK1 stimulation seemed to depend on reactive
oxygen species (ROS) production because the ROS scavenger Nacetyl cysteine was able to prevent both SphK1 stimulation and
HIF-1a accumulation. How generation of ROS results in SphK1
stimulation is currently unknown. A large body of evidence
suggests that ROS can modulate HIF-1a level (4) through direct
inhibition of prolyl-hydroxylases, but also indirectly via activation
of the Akt/GSK3h signaling (17). Interestingly, we found that the
SphK1-mediated accumulation of HIF-1a levels under hypoxia
relied on the Akt/GSK3h pathway (Fig. 1). How the biolipid S1P
produced upon SphK1 stimulation activates Akt/GSK3h signaling
(intracellular versus autocrine effect) is currently under investigation. Finally, demonstrating the instrumental role of SphK1, both

The Sphingosine Kinase-1 Signaling in Hypoxia

pharmacological and RNA-silencing inhibition of SphK1 activity
could prevent activation of Akt/GSK3h signaling, accumulation of
HIF-1a and its transcriptional activity in all human cancer cell
lineages. Since publication of the seminal report by Wang and
colleagues, the major regulatory mechanism of HIF-1a accumulation under hypoxia is its pVHL-mediated proteasomal degradation
(18). We established that HIF-1a degradation triggered by SphK1
inhibition was controlled by the proteasome via a pVHL-dependent
mechanism as shown by inhibition of the proteasome by the
MG132 compound or using pVHL-deficient and reconstituted
pVHL cell models (ref. 16) (Fig. 1).
Whereas initial characterization of hypoxia-induced transcription focused on HIF-1a, there is now evidence that HIF-2a, which
is closely related to HIF-1a, could regulate unique genes and
physiological functions. HIFa subunits differ in expression profiles,
with HIF-1a ubiquitously expressed and HIF-2a limited to
endothelium, kidney, heart, lung, gastrointestinal epithelium, and
some cells of the central nervous system (19). So far, distinct roles
for HIF-1a versus HIF-2a in promoting tumor growth have been
mostly clearly defined in von Hippel-Lindau disease-associated
clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC) (ref. 20), which can produce
either HIF-1a and HIF-2a or HIF-2a alone, and in which the role
for HIF-2a as a driver of a more aggressive disease has been
recently highlighted (21). Interestingly, a recent report has
suggested a link between the SphK1/S1P pathway and HIF-2a in
cobalt chloride (CoCl2) chemically induced hypoxia in gliomaderived U87 cells (22). Under these conditions, increases in SphK1
message, protein expression, and enzyme activity were noted.
Knockdown of HIF-2a by RNA interference abolished the induction
of SphK1, whereas HIF-1a down-regulation resulted in increased
HIF-2a and SphK1 expression. In terms of regulatory mechanisms,
direct binding of HIF-2a to the SphK1 promoter was suggested
(22). Although in apparent contradiction with our own data in
which SphK1 activity was found to be an upstream regulator of
HIF-1a in the same cell model, it should be noted that the
influence of SphK1 activity on HIF-1a protein levels was not
investigated in that study. In addition, hypoxia mimetics such as
CoCl2 should not be considered equivalent to bona fide hypoxia,
and results should be interpreted accordingly. Nevertheless, it
cannot be ruled out that SphK1 activity might first regulate HIF-1a
(and/or HIF-2a) activity, which in turn could transcriptionally
regulate the proangiogenic and prosurvival SphK1/S1P pathway.
Additional studies are required to elucidate whether (1) SphK1 can
be a target gene of HIF-2a as proposed by Obeid and co-workers
(22), and (2) SphK1 activity regulates HIF-2a as it does for HIF-1a
(16), particularly in a relevant model such as the von HippelLindau-associated clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC).

New Targets for Cancer Therapy
Drugs aimed at targeting tumor stromal-cell responses represent
a novel category of therapeutic agents. As a matter of fact, a large
number of drugs are currently in clinical trials as anticancer agents
on the basis of their ability to inhibit angiogenesis. For instance,
therapies against VEGF, an HIF-1 target, have shown some efficacy
and have prompted interest in targeting global HIF-1 activity.
Given the central role of HIF-1, it is clear that decreasing its activity
could represent a valid strategy to control tumor hypoxia and its
molecular consequences: increased potential for invasion, neoangiogenesis, metastasis, and patient mortality. Finding a specific
HIF-1 inhibitor is not easy as transcription factors are convention-

ally considered difficult if not impractical targets for the discovery
of small molecule inhibitors (23). Signal transduction pathways
involved in HIF-1 stabilization occurring during hypoxic stress can
also be targeted to inhibit HIF-1 activity. Although they lack
selectivity, several agents that inhibit signal transduction pathways
regulating HIF-1 activity, angiogenesis, and xenograft growth have
been identified (e.g., PI3K/AKT inhibitors, camptothecins, etc.)
(refs. 7, 24). As SphK1 can act as a master regulator of HIF-1
activity, we suggest its inhibition as a novel and valid approach to
control tumor hypoxia and its molecular consequences. In human
tumors, increased activity of HIF-1 is induced by physiological
stimulation as well as genetic alterations such as PTEN or p53
loss-of-function mutations. Interestingly, we have established that
SphK1 inhibitory strategies were able to almost abrogate HIF-1a
expression in cancer cells regardless of their PTEN or p53 status
(e.g., prostate PC-3 cells are null for p53 and PTEN; glioblastoma
U87 cells contain wild-type p53 but are null for PTEN; lung A549
cells contain wild-type p53 and PTEN).
Activation of HIF-1 expression in tumors seems to be initiated
through a vicious cycle of induction of poorly functioning
vasculature perpetuating the development of a hypoxic microenvironment throughout the tumor. Hypoxic cancer cells are prone to
be more resistant to radiation and chemotherapy. In addition to
drugs developed specifically as antiangiogenesis agents such as the
anti-VEGF strategies (25), it is clear that therapeutic agents
targeting signal-transduction pathways up-regulated under hypoxia
might exhibit antiangiogenic properties reflecting, at least in part,
their capability of decreasing HIF-1 activity. As recently illustrated
with a PI3K inhibitor, the inhibition of Akt activity has indeed
been shown to down-regulate HIF1-a (and VEGF expression), and
increase oxygenation within tumor xenografts (26). Similarly to the
aforementioned anti-PI3K and anti-VEGF studies, it is tempting to
speculate that inhibiting the SphK1/S1P signaling might increase
tumor sensitivity to radiation and chemotherapy in relation to the
broader concept of ‘‘normalization of tumor vessels’’ as tumor
oxygenation is known to enhance response to chemotherapy and
radiation (27). The normalization of tumor vasculature initiated by
anti-VEGF strategies relies on the reduction of vascular permeability (27). Interestingly, despite the fact that S1P has originally
been shown to promote endothelial cell integrity (28, 29), it has
recently been shown that S1P could increase vascular permeability
(30) similar to VEGF, the canonical vascular permeability factor.
Although it remains to be shown whether or not anti-S1P strategies
might directly impact vascular permeability, it has been recently
established that targeting S1P by using anti-S1P antibody could
reduce plasma levels of VEGF in xenograft experimental models
(31). Hence, it is conceivable that anti-SphK1/S1P strategies might,
at least indirectly, by reducing VEGF levels, decrease vascular
permeability, and thus, lead to normalization of tumor vessels.
