Abstract
Heparanase is the only enzyme in mammals capable of cleaving
heparan sulfate, an activity implicated in tumor inﬂammation,
angiogenesis, and metastasis. Heparanase is secreted as a latent
enzyme that is internalized and subjected to proteolytic processing and activation in lysosomes. Its role under normal conditions
has yet to be understood. Here, we provide evidence that heparanase resides within autophagosomes, where studies in heparanase-deﬁcient or transgenic mice established its contributions to
autophagy. The protumorigenic properties of heparanase were
found to be mediated, in part, by its proautophagic function, as

Introduction
Heparanase is an endo-b-glucuronidase that cleaves heparan
sulfate side chains presumably at sites of low sulfation. Enzymatic degradation of heparan sulfate leads to disassembly of
the extracellular matrix (ECM) and is therefore involved in
fundamental biologic phenomena associated with tissue remodeling and cell invasion, including inﬂammation, angiogenesis,
and metastasis (1–4). In addition, the multitude of polypeptides sequestered and regulated by heparan sulfate and the
ability of heparanase to convert these into bioavailable molecules (5, 6) require that these activities will be kept tightly
regulated. We have shown previously that following secretion
as a latent 65-kDa enzyme, heparanase rapidly interacts with
cell membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG; i.e.,
syndecans; refs. 7–10), followed by internalization and processing into a highly active 50-kDa enzyme (7, 11). Notably,
heparanase was shown to reside primarily within endocytic
vesicles, assuming a polar, perinuclear localization and colocalizing with lysosomal markers (7, 8, 10, 12). In addition,
it has been demonstrated that incubation with endosomal/
lysosomal fraction, but not membrane or cytosolic prepara-

demonstrated in tumor xenograft models of human cancer and
through use of inhibitors of the lysosome (chloroquine) and
heparanase (PG545), both alone and in combination. Notably,
heparanase-overexpressing cells were more resistant to stress and
chemotherapy in a manner associated with increased autophagy,
effects that were reversed by chloroquine treatment. Collectively,
our results establish a role for heparanase in modulating autophagy in normal and malignant cells, thereby conferring growth
advantages under stress as well as resistance to chemotherapy.

tions, leads to heparanase processing and activation (13).
Likewise, heparanase processing was blocked by chloroquine
and baﬁlomycin A1, which inhibit lysosomal proteases by
raising the lysosome pH (11). Subsequent studies using sitedirected mutagenesis, gene silencing, and pharmacological
inhibitors have identiﬁed cathepsin L as the primary lysosomal
protease responsible for heparanase processing and activation
(14–16). Despite its localization in a highly active protein
degradation environment such as the lysosome, heparanase
appears stable (12) and exhibits a half-life of about 30 hours
(17), relatively long compared with a t1/2 of 2 to 6 hours and
25 minutes of transmembrane and GPI-anchored HSPGs,
respectively (18). Residence and accumulation of heparanase
in lysosomes may indicate that the enzyme functions in the
normal physiology of this organelle but such a function has not
been described yet.
Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved catabolic pathway
through which cytoplasmic components, including macromolecules such as proteins and lipids as well as whole organelles, are
sequestered into double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes. Autophagosomes are subsequently fused with lysosomes,
where the intracellular material is degraded and recycled. This
process occurs in every cell at a basal level and is required to
remove unfolded proteins and damaged organelles, thus maintaining cellular homeostasis. Autophagy is induced signiﬁcantly
by starvation and stress, promoting cancer cells survival by providing their metabolic needs (19, 20). Here, we provide evidence
that heparanase enhances autophagy. Moreover, we show that
enhanced tumor growth and chemoresistance exerted by heparanase are mediated, in part, by augmenting autophagy.

have been described previously (8, 21–23). SIHN-013 laryngeal
carcinoma cells were kindly provided by Sue Eccles (Institute of
Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, UK; ref. 24). Cells were grown in
DMEM (Biological Industries) supplemented with 10% FBS and
antibiotics. Mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEF) of control and
heparanase knockout (KO) mice have been described elsewhere
(25). Cells were passed in culture no more than 2 months after
being thawed from authentic stocks.
Antibodies and reagents
Anti-phopsho-p70S6-kinase, anti-p70S6-kinase, anti-TSC2,
anti-PTEN, and anti-mTOR antibodies were purchased from Cell
Signaling. Anti-LC3 and anti-actin monoclonal antibodies were
purchased from Sigma. The heparanase inhibitor PG545 was
kindly provided by Progen Pharmaceuticals (26). Cisplatin and
doxorubicin were obtained from the Oncology Department,
Rambam Health Care Campus (Haifa, Israel). LysoTracker was
purchased from Molecular Probes (Life Technologies); Torin was
purchased from Tocris Bioscience.
Cell lysates and immunoblotting
Preparation of cell and tissue extracts and immunoblotting
were carried out essentially as described (10). Following
induction of autophagy, the cytosolic form of LC3 (LC3-I) is
conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (LC3-II), which is
recruited to autophagosomal membranes, serving as a most
acceptable mean to measure autophagy levels. Immunoblots
were subjected to densitometry analyses and the relative
intensity of bands (i.e., fold change) is presented underneath
the gel.
Immunocytochemistry
Immunoﬂuorescent staining of methanol-ﬁxed cells and analysis by confocal microscopy was carried out essentially as
described (10). To better detect LC3 by immunoﬂuorescence or
electron microscopy, autophagy was initiated by depriving the
cells of amino acids for 3 hours, in the presence of chloroquine
(Chl, 50 mg/mL; Sigma).
Colony formation in soft agar
DMEM (3 mL) containing 0.5% low-melt agarose (Bio-Rad)
and 10% FCS was poured into 60-mm Petri dishes. The layer was
covered with cell suspension (2  103 cells) in 1.5-mL DMEM
containing 0.3% low-melt agarose and 10% FCS, followed by
addition of 2-mL DMEM containing 10% FCS without or with
PG545 (25 mg/mL), chloroquine (50 mg/mL), or both. Medium
was exchanged every 3 days. Colonies were visualized and
counted under a microscope 2 to 5 weeks after seeding, as
described previously (27).
MTT assay
The number of viable cells was evaluated by thiazolyl blue
tetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma) that measures the activity of
cellular enzymes that reduce the tetrazolium dye, MTT, to its
insoluble formazan, yielding a purple color. Cells (5  103/well)
were grown in 96-well plate and subjected to various treatments as
indicated. MTT (100 mg) was then added to each well for 2 to 3
hours, followed by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended
in 150 mL of isopropanol and absorbance was measured at 570
nm using an ELISA plate reader, as described (27).

Tumorigenicity and immunohistochemistry
U87 cells were detached with trypsin/EDTA, washed with PBS,
and brought to a concentration of 5  107 cells/mL. Cell suspension (5  106/0.1 mL) was inoculated subcutaneously at the right
ﬂank of 6-week-old female SCID mice (n ¼ 7). Mice were
administrated with the heparanase inhibitor PG545 (20 mg/kg;
once weekly), chloroquine (50 mg/kg; every day), or both, and
xenografts size was determined by externally measuring tumors in
2 dimensions using a caliper. At the end of the experiment, mice
were sacriﬁced; tumor xenografts were removed, weighed, and
ﬁxed in formalin. Parafﬁn-embedded 5-mm sections were
subjected to immunostaining applying anti-LC3, anti-phosphop70S6K, or anti-glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP; Dako) antibodies using the Envision Kit according to the manufacturer's
(Dako) instructions, as described previously (28).
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as means  SE. Statistical signiﬁcance was
analyzed by the 2-tailed Student t test. Values of P < 0.05 were
considered signiﬁcant. Datasets passed D'Agostino–Pearson normality (GraphPad Prism 5 utility software). All experiments were
repeated at least 3 times with similar results.

Results
Heparanase augments autophagy
We ﬁrst examined the possibility that heparanase is localized
within autophagosome. To this end, latent heparanase (1 mg/mL)
was added exogenously to HeLa cells stably expressing LC3-GFP
gene construct and cells were left untreated (Con) or were deprived of amino acids (AA) in the presence of chloroquine. The latter
is a lysosome inhibitor that allows the formation and accumulation of autophagosomes but prevents their activity. LC3-GFP
ﬂuorescence was evident only in conditions that stimulate autophagy (AA þ Chl; Fig. 1A, top, green), co-localizing with heparanase (Fig. 1A, right bottom, yellow). A similar colocalization
of endogenous LC3 and heparanase was noted in SIHN-013
laryngeal carcinoma cells overexpressing heparanase following
autophagy stimulation (Fig. 1B). We further found that LC3-II
level was reduced in MEF derived from Hpa-KO mice that lack
heparanase activity (Fig. 2A, bottom; ref. 25) versus control MEF
(Fig. 2A, top, Con) and even greater reduction in LC3-II level was
quantiﬁed after treatment with chloroquine (Fig. 2A, top, Chl).
Reduced LC3-II level in Hpa-KO MEF was also evident by immunoﬂuorescent staining (Fig. 2A, middle). Similarly, we observed
reduced autophagy levels (i.e., LC3-II) in the lung, kidney, and
mammary gland of Hpa-KO mice (Fig. 2B, KO), whereas increased
level of autophagy was observed in the lung, mammary gland, and
pancreas tissues of transgenic mice (Hpa-Tg; ref. 29) overexpressing heparanase (Fig. 2B, Tg). Increased autophagy in the pancreas
of Hpa-Tg mice versus control was further evident by electron
microscopy (EM; Fig. 2C;  , P ¼ 0.0003). Collectively, these results
suggest that heparanase is localized within autophagosomes and
is involved in the regulation of autophagy.
Even higher increase of autophagy was observed following
heparanase overexpression in tumor-derived cells. Autophagy
(i.e., LC3-II) was markedly increased under resting conditions
(Con; Fig. 3A–C, top), and further increase in LC3-II levels was
noted following chloroquine treatment (Fig. 3A and B; Chl, top),
evident by immunoblotting (Fig. 3A–C, top) and immunoﬂuorescent staining (Fig. 3A, bottom) of heparanase-overexpressing

SIHN-013 laryngeal carcinoma (Fig. 3A), FaDu pharyngeal
carcinoma (Fig. 3B), and rat C6 glioma (Supplementary Fig.
S1A) cells. Increased autophagy in FaDu cells overexpressing
heparanase is further demonstrated by electron microscopy of
unstimulated (Supplementary Fig. S1B) and amino acid–starved
(Fig. 3B, bottom) cells, increase that was statistically highly significant [P ¼ 0.00001 and 0.01 for mock vs. Hepa under resting (Con)
and AA þ Chl conditions, respectively; Supplementary Fig. S1B,
right]. LC3-II induction comparable in magnitude was evident also
by U87 glioma cells overexpressing heparanase (Hepa; Fig. 3C,
Con); notably, autophagy induction was prevented by the heparanase inhibitor PG545 (PG; Fig. 3C) and was associated with
accumulation of heparanase in the culture medium of U87-Hepa
cells treated with this compound (PG; Fig. 3D, top), thus mimicking the effect of heparan/heparan sulphate (7). Unexpectedly,
even higher accumulation of the latent (65 kDa) and active (50
kDa) forms of heparanase was detected in the culture medium of
cells treated with PG545 and chloroquine (PG þ Chl; Fig. 3D, top).
In PG545-treated cells, and to a lesser extent PG545 plus chloroquine-treated cells, accumulation of heparanase in the culture
medium was accompanied by decreased levels of intracellular
heparanase (Fig. 3D, second and bottom; Supplementary
Fig. S1C), implying that PG545 attenuates autophagy also by
decreasing the content of intracellular heparanase.
Protumorigenic function of heparanase involves induction of
autophagy
We next examined whether induction of autophagy underlies
the protumorigenic function of heparanase. We have shown

3948 Cancer Res; 75(18) September 15, 2015

previously that U87 glioma cells overexpressing heparanase are
endowed with higher proliferation rate and form more and bigger
colonies in soft agar (21, 22, 30). Applying the MTT assay we
found that chloroquine treatment reduces U87 cell viability
compared with control untreated cells (Fig. 4A, Chl), decrease
that was most pronounced when combined with pharmacologically relevant concentrations (8 mmol/L; ref. 31) of the heparanase inhibitor PG545 (Fig. 4A, Chl þ PG;  , P ¼ 6.2  1010 for
Chl vs. PG þ Chl). A similar synergistic effect of chloroquine and
PG545 was observed with C6-Hepa rat glioma cells (Fig. 4B;  ,
P ¼ 0.01 for PG vs. PG þ Chl). Notably, colony formation in
soft agar was markedly reduced by chloroquine treatment (Fig.
4C, Chl), synergizing with PG545 in terms of colony number
(Fig. 4C and D;  , P ¼ 0.003 for Chl vs. PG þ Chl) and size
(Fig. 4C). We have reported previously that overexpression of
heparanase in U87 cells enhanced the growth of tumor xenografts (21, 30). Immunohistochemistry revealed that the
growth advantage of these tumor xenografts is associated with
increased staining of LC3 (Fig. 5A, Hepa). To further reveal the role
of autophagy in this system, mice were inoculated subcutaneously
with U87 cells and treated with chloroquine (50 mg/kg, every
day), PG545 (20 mg/kg; once a week), or both. Tumor growth was
attenuated by chloroquine (P ¼ 0.02 for Con vs. Chl) and PG545
(P ¼ 0.0004 for Con vs. PG) as single agents and was most evident
when the two compounds are combined (Fig. 5B and C;  , P ¼
0.006 for PG vs. PG þ Chl and P ¼ 0.003 for Chl vs. PG þ Chl),
resembling the in vitro results (Fig. 4A, C, and D). In addition, we
found that U87 tumor xenografts from treated mice exhibit higher
levels of GFAP immunoreactivity (Fig. 5D), suggesting that these

differentiation.
In the skin, LC3-II levels are undetectable under normal
conditions in control, Hpa-Tg, or Hpa-KO mice (not shown).
Exposing the skin tissue to 2-step 7,12dimethylbenz(a)

(DMBA)/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate
(TPA) skin carcinogenesis model resulted in marked increase
in the number and size of tumor lesions in Hpa-Tg compared
with control mice (32). Notably, the increased tumorigenicity
in Hpa-Tg mice was associated with a noticeable increase in
autophagy revealed by LC3 staining that was reduced by PG545
(Fig. 5E, left), thus providing another indication for the
involvement of autophagy in heparanase-mediated tumor
expansion. To explore this notion further, we exposed control
and Hpa-Tg mice to DMBA-TPA protocol. By 15 weeks, when

small tumor lesions started to appear, Hpa-Tg mice were
divided into 2 groups and chloroquine was administrated every
day (50 mg/kg; intraperitoneally) for 4 weeks. Chloroquine had
no effect on the number or size of tumor lesions developed (not
shown). Pathologic examination revealed, however, that chloroquine treatment resulted in exophytic tumor growth, exhibiting less downward epithelial proliferation (Tg þ Chl; Fig. 5E,
rightmost panels) compared with untreated lesions that displayed endophytic, irregular growth and invaded the underlying stroma (Tg; Fig. 5E, middle), thus signifying more aggressive tumors compared with tumors developed in chloroquinetreated mice.
Mechanistically, autophagy induction by heparanase appears
to involve the mTORC1. This nutrient-sensing kinase acts as
a master negative regulator of autophagy because during

starvation, mTOR1 is inhibited and this induces autophagy (33).
mTOR1 activity can be assessed by the phosphorylation status of
p70S6K, a speciﬁc downstream substrate of mTOR1. In cells
overexpressing heparanase, we observed reduced phospho-p70
S6 kinase levels (Fig. 6A, Con, top), in agreement with increased
autophagy (Fig. 3). Moreover, a substantial increase in p70S6K
phosphorylation level was observed in Hpa-KO MEF versus
control (WO; Fig. 6B), in agreement with reduced autophagy
in these cells (Fig. 2A). In accordance with these results, we
observed increased p70S6K phosphorylation levels in tumor
xenografts following treatment with inhibitors of heparanase
(PG545) or autophagy (chloroquine; Fig. 6C; Supplementary
Fig. S1D). The alterations in p70S6K phosphorylation in relation

3950 Cancer Res; 75(18) September 15, 2015

to heparanase levels were associated with the cellular localization of mTOR1. In control MEF, mTOR1 was localized within
scattered vesicles but appeared diffusely distributed in Hpa-KO
MEF (Fig. 6D, WO). p70S6K phosphorylation was reduced
markedly in MEF treated with mTOR1 inhibitor (Torin; Fig.
6B), resulting in accumulation of mTOR1 perinuclearly (Fig.
6D). We also found that mTOR1 assumes perinuclear localization in cells with high content of heparanase (Hepa; Fig. 6E,
right) compared with a more diffused distribution in control
cells (Con; Fig. 6E, left) and noted that mTOR1 colocalizes with
heparanase (Fig. 6E) and LysoTracker that labels acidic lysosomal vesicles (Fig. 6F). Notably, Hpa-KO MEF were more
sensitive to the mTOR1 inhibitor, resulting in decreased p70S6K

phosphorylation to an extent 7-fold lower than in control MEF
(Supplementary Fig. S2C).
Autophagy induction by heparanase-endowed cells with
chemoresistance
While the protumorigenic properties of heparanase are well
documented, its function in chemoresistance has not been so
far explored. To examine this aspect, we ﬁrst exposed control
(Mock) and heparanase-overexpressing (Hepa) U87 glioma
cells to amino acid starvation without (AA; Fig. 7A) or with
chloroquine (AA þ Chl; Fig. 7A) and cell viability was evaluated
by MTT assay. Amino acid starvation reduced the viability of
control (Mock) cells to half compared with untreated cells
(Con) but did not reduce the viability of heparanase-overexpressing cells (Hepa; Fig. 7A, AA), also evident by cell
morphology (Supplementary Fig. S1E), differences that are
statistically highly signiﬁcant (P ¼ 0.00001 for Mock vs. Hepa).
Notably, the resistance of heparanase-overexpressing cells was
reversed by combining amino acid starvation with chloroquine
(Fig. 7A, AA þ Chl), suggesting that resistance to starvation
stress is mediated by induction of autophagy in U87-Hepa cells
(Fig. 3C) and can be prevented by autophagy inhibitor. This
was further evident by the increased number of colonies formed
by cells overexpressing heparanase versus control cells (Mock,
Fig. 7B and C; P ¼ 0.01), growth advantage that was reversed by
the inclusion of chloroquine (Fig. 7B and C). More importantly, heparanase-overexpressing U87 glioma and FaDu pharyngeal carcinoma cells were more resistant to cisplatin treatment
at concentrations of 0.1 mg/mL and above (Supplementary Fig.

www.aacrjournals.org

S2A), and this tolerance was similarly prevented by combining
cisplatin and chloroquine (Fig. 7D). This implies that heparanase provides cells with chemoresistance that is mediated, in
part, by increased autophagy.

Discussion
Heparanase expression is increased in many types of tumors
and this elevation is often associated with more aggressive disease
and poor prognosis (1, 2, 34), but the role of heparanase under
normal conditions has not been resolved thus far. Here, we
describe for the ﬁrst time a role of lysosomal heparanase in
modulating autophagy, an evolutionary conserved mechanism
that delivers intracellular proteins, lipids, and organelles to the
lysosomal compartment for degradation and recycling (20).
Residing for relatively long period of time in the lysosome
led us to hypothesize that heparanase may be found within
autophagosomes. Indeed, double immunoﬂuorescent staining
clearly shows that heparanase colocalizes with GFP-labeled and
endogenous LC3-II (Fig. 1). LC3-II is a convenient and widely
used marker of autophagy because it forms and remains associated with the autophagosome even after fusion with lysosomes. Moreover, LC3-II is the only known protein that speciﬁcally associates with autophagosomes and not with other
vesicles and thus its level reﬂects the amount of autophagic
vacuoles (35). Our results indicate that heparanase does not
only reside in autophagosomes but also modulate autophagy.
This is concluded because reduced LC3-II levels are found in
MEF and tissues obtained from heparanase KO mice (Fig. 2B).

Likewise, LC3-II level was enhanced in transgenic mice that
overexpress heparanase (Fig. 2B, Tg; ref. 29).
Even higher induction of autophagy was evident in head
and neck carcinoma (SIHN-013, FaDu) and glioma (U87, C6)
cells overexpressing heparanase (Fig. 3A–C). These cell systems
were preferred because previous results provided a strong
preclinical and clinical signiﬁcance of heparanase in the progression of these malignancies (21–23, 30, 36–38). A noticeable 3- to 8-fold increase in LC3-II levels was observed under
control, serum-free conditions (Fig. 3, Con) and following
treatment with chloroquine (Fig. 3, Chl), revealed by biochemical measures and electron microscopy. Interestingly, electron
microscopic analyses of FaDu cells overexpressing heparanase

3952 Cancer Res; 75(18) September 15, 2015

revealed not only a higher number of autophagic vacuoles
(Supplementary Fig. S1B, bottom, asterisks) but also abundant
release of vesicles, possibly exosomes, from the cell surface
(Supplementary Fig. S1B, bottom, arrow). This supports the
notion that heparanase enhances exosome secretion that contributes to tumor growth (39, 40).
The mechanism underlying autophagy induction by heparanase is not entirely clear but likely involves mTOR1 that plays
a pivotal role in nutrient-sensing and autophagy regulation
(41). mTOR1 activity inhibits autophagy but under starvation,
its activity is repressed, leading to autophagy induction. Similarly, mTOR1 inhibitors such as rapamycin induce autophagy
(42). Interestingly, we found that heparanase overexpression

associates with reduced mTOR1 activity, evident by decreased levels of p70S6K phosphorylation, an mTOR1 substrate
(Fig. 6A, top; Supplementary Fig. S2B), whereas heparanaseKO MEF are endowed with increased p70S6K phosphorylation
levels (Fig. 6B). Similarly, heparanase inhibition by PG545
results in increased mTOR1 activity and p70S6K phosphorylation (Fig. 6C; Supplementary Fig. S1D). The reason for
mTOR1 inhibition by heparanase may be related to alteration
of mTOR1 localization within the cell evident in three independent experimental settings. First, vesicular mTOR1 appeared
scattered in control MEF but accumulate at perinuclear regions
following treatment with mTOR inhibitor (Torin, Fig. 6D, left).
Similarly, mTOR1 appeared more diffusely scattered in control
cells, whereas in cells with high content of heparanase, mTOR1
is found mostly in perinuclear regions, colocalizing with heparanase (Fig. 6E, Hepa) and LysoTracker (Fig. 6F, Hepa) that
labels acidic lysosomal vesicles. Third, in heparanase KO, MEF
mTOR1 do not reside in vesicles but rather diffusely distributed
in the cytoplasm (Fig. 6D), associated with increased p70S6K
phosphorylation (Fig. 6B, WO). This agrees with the notion

3954 Cancer Res; 75(18) September 15, 2015

that activation of mTOR1 by nutrients is associated with
peripheral lysosomes, whereas starvation leads to perinuclear
clustering of lysosomes and decreased mTOR1 activity (43).
Thus, Torin, and to a lesser degree heparanase, results in
accumulation of mTOR1 at perinuclear regions, leading to
reduced mTOR1 activity and increased autophagy (43, 44).
Localization of mTOR1 to LysoTracker-positive acidic vesicles
appeared unique because no such colocalization was evident
for PTEN or TSC2 (Supplementary Fig. S3), intrinsic components of the PI3K signaling pathway. This is not surprising
because we used nutrient starvation to induce autophagy,
which, unlike growth factors, is not regulated by the PTEN/
Akt/TCS pathway but rather involves as yet uncharacterized
cytoplasmic sensor (45, 46).
Compelling evidence has shown that heparanase is upregulated in various primary solid tumors (i.e., carcinomas and
sarcomas) and hematologic malignancies (2, 34, 47). The consequence of heparanase induction most often associates with
disease progression and bad prognosis, thus encouraging the
development of heparanase inhibitors (26, 48, 49). The

Heparanase Augments Autophagy

molecular mechanism(s) exerted by heparanase to promote
tumor initiation and progression is still incompletely understood.
The results of the current study imply that autophagy induction
contributes to the protumorigenic function of heparanase. This
emerges from in vitro and in vivo experiments using inhibitors of
autophagy (chloroquine) and heparanase (PG545) alone or in
combination. The heparanase inhibitor PG545 signiﬁcantly
reduces U87 cell survival and colony number (Fig. 4A and C),
resembling the effect of PG545 on pancreatic carcinoma cells
(31). Notably, chloroquine treatment resulted in a comparable
effect and even more effective inhibition is obtained by combining PG545 and chloroquine in vitro (Fig. 4, PG þ Chl) and,
moreover, in a tumor xenograft model in vivo, resulting in significantly smaller and more differentiated tumors (Fig. 5A–D).
Increased cell differentiation (i.e., elevation of E-cadherin) was
also noted in pancreatic carcinoma cells treated with PG545 (31),
suggesting that heparanase activity drives cancer cell dedifferentiation as part of its protumorigenic properties.
Immunostaining further revealed that enhanced tumor
growth in Hpa-Tg mice exposed to 2-step skin carcinogenesis
model (DMBA/TPA;32) is associated with increased LC3 staining, which is reduced substantially by PG545 (Fig. 5E, left),
along with decreased tumor burden (32), thus adding another
route by which this compound attenuates tumor growth (50).
In a subsequent experiment, the number and size of tumor
lesions developed by Hpa-Tg mice exposed to the DMBA/TPA
regimen were not affected by chloroquine (not shown). Pathologic examination revealed, nonetheless, that chloroquine
treatment resulted in less aggressive tumors indicated by exophytic growth pattern and less invasive capacity toward the
underlying skin tissue compared with untreated lesions (Fig.
5E, middle and right), suggesting that autophagy dictates skin
cancer severity.
Equally important is the ability of heparanase overexpression
to confer resistance to stress and chemotherapy (Fig. 7D and
Supplementary Fig. S2A) mediated, at least in part, by enhancing
autophagy (Fig. 7D). Accordingly, heparanase KO MEF were more
sensitive to mTOR inhibitor than control MEF (Torin; Fig. 6B and
Supplementary Fig. S2C). Moreover, in cell invasion assay, heparanase KO MEF exhibit lower invasion capacity and were more
sensitive to chloroquine than control MEF (Supplementary Fig.
S2D). This adds mechanistic view to previous results demonstrating resistance of heparanase-overexpressing cells to inhibitors of
EGFR (22, 51) and the established role of autophagy as a survival
pathway. Indeed, diverse classes of anticancer drugs induce
autophagy, thus attenuating tumor cell elimination, whereas
autophagy inhibitors overcome chemoresistance (42, 52). On
the basis of this concept, chloroquine is currently evaluated in
several clinical trials including head and neck carcinoma and
glioma in combination with different classes of chemotherapeutic
agents (42).
Interestingly, bacterial heparinase III was noted to enhance
autophagy in endothelial cells, and autophagy was further
enhanced when heparinase III was combined with oxidized
low-density lipoprotein, a mechanism thought to allow endo-

thelial cell survival during stress (53). Heparanase is an endoglucuronidase that cleaves heparan sulphate in a far more selective
manner than heparinase III, yet cleavage and/or clustering of
heparan sulphate within lysosomes may still exert a proautophagy
effect by heparanase, although nonenzymatic function (1, 30)
cannot be excluded.
In addition to neutralizing heparanase enzymatic activity,
PG545 has recently been shown to inhibit signaling properties
of heparanase, attenuating Akt phosphorylation (32). PG545
similarly prevented autophagy induction by heparanase
(Fig. 3C, Con vs. PG), associating with accumulation of heparanase extracellularly and decreased intracellular content of
heparanase (Fig. 3D). Thus, PG545 emerges as a broad-spectrum heparanase inhibitor, neutralizing its enzymatic, signaling, and autophagic properties. Combining PG545 with inhibitors of autophagy such as chloroquine may yield even higher
efﬁcacy in cases that more strictly depend on autophagy for
tumor growth.
