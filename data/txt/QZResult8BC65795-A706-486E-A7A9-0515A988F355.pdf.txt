BACKGROUND: Insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) is implicated in the pathogenesis of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), osteosarcoma (OS), and synovial sarcoma (SS). The authors conducted a multi-institutional phase 2 trial of the monoclonal antibody R1507
in patients with various subtypes of recurrent or refractory sarcomas. METHODS: Eligibility criteria included age 2 years and a diagnosis of recurrent or refractory RMS, OS, SS, and other soft tissue sarcomas. Patients received a weekly dose of 9 mg=kg R1507 intravenously. The primary endpoint was the best objective response rate using World Health Organization criteria. Tumor imaging was
performed every 6 weeks 3 4 and every 12 weeks thereafter. RESULTS: From December 2007 through August 2009, 163 eligible
patients from 33 institutions were enrolled. The median patient age was 31 years (range, 7-85 years). Histologic diagnoses included
OS (n 5 38), RMS (n 5 36), SS (n 5 23), and other sarcomas (n 5 66). The overall objective response rate was 2.5% (95% confidence
interval, 0.7%-6.2%). Partial responses were observed in 4 patients, including 2 patients with OS, 1 patient with RMS, and 1 patient
with alveolar soft part sarcoma. Four additional patients (3 with RMS and 1 with myxoid liposarcoma) had a 50% decrease in tumor
size that lasted for <4 weeks. The median progression-free survival was 5.7 weeks, and the median overall survival was 11 months. The
most common grade 3=4 toxicities were metabolic (12%), hematologic (6%), gastrointestinal (4%), and general constitutional symptoms (8%). CONCLUSIONS: R1507 is safe and well tolerated but has limited activity in patients with recurrent or refractory bone and
soft tissue sarcomas. Additional studies to help identify the predictive factors associated with clinical benefit in selected histologies

INTRODUCTION
The outcome for patients with advanced or recurrent bone and soft tissue sarcomas has remained unchanged over the past
20 years.1-3 Effective standard agents for this population are limited. Newer, more effective, and less toxic therapies are
urgently needed to improve the outcome of these patients.4-9 Genomic analysis of sarcomas has demonstrated that identification of targets and new therapeutics is particularly challenging.10

IGF-1R, Sarcomas, R1507/Pappo et al

The type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) is a tyrosine kinase receptor that belongs to the insulin
receptor family. Activation of the receptor by its ligands
IGF-1 and IGF-2 induces mitosis, protects cells against
apoptosis, and helps maintain a transformed phenotype.11
Blocking the IGF-1R decreases tumor proliferation by inhibiting v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog
(AKT)-mediated survival signals, and this response
appears to be correlated with elevated IGF-1R levels.12
In addition to Ewing sarcoma (ES),13,14 the IGF-1R
pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of other
bone and soft tissue sarcomas, including rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), osteosarcoma (OS), synovial sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, and solitary fibrous
tumor.14 In RMS tumors and cell lines, IGF-2 functions
as an autocrine and motility growth factor, and IGF-1R is
1 of the targets for the paired box 3-forkhead box O1A
(PAX3-FOXOA1) fusion transcript of alveolar RMS.15,16
Antibodies against IGF-1R are safe and exhibit clinical activity in patients with recurrent ES and neuroendocrine tumors.17-21 R1507 (F. Hoffman-LaRoche, Basel,
Switzerland) is a fully human immunoglobulin G1
(IgG1)-type monoclonal antibody directed against the
human IGF-1R, and the Sarcoma Alliance for Research
through Collaboration (SARC) conducted a phase 2,
multiarm study with this agent in multiple sarcoma subtypes. On the basis of preclinical data, the authors
believed that OS, RMS, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, and ES were important subtypes for inclusion in
that trial. The outcomes of patients with ES have been
reported separately.18 The current report details the
results from a phase 2 study in patients with recurrent or
progressive RMS, high-grade OS, synovial sarcoma, and
other soft tissue sarcomas, including translocationassociated sarcomas like alveolar soft part sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, extraskeletal myxoid
chondrosarcoma, clear cell sarcoma, and myxoid liposarcoma, who received treatment with R1507.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility included a centrally histologically verified diagnosis of RMS, high-grade OS, synovial sarcoma, or other
sarcoma; age >2 years; a life expectancy of at least 6 weeks;
a Karnofsky=Lansky performance status >70%; bidimensionally measurable disease by computed tomography or
magnetic resonance imaging; adequate bone marrow,
liver, and renal function; and off chemotherapy for at least
3 weeks. Patients with central nervous system disease had
no overt neurologic deficit, were off glucocorticoids for at
least 4 weeks, and were off irradiation for >6 weeks.

Patients were excluded if they had significant unrelated
systemic illness, prior hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal antibodies, treatment within 2 weeks of study entry
with pharmacologic doses of corticosteroids or other
immunosuppressive agents, prior therapy with insulinlike growth factor inhibitors, poorly controlled diabetes,
or a history of solid organ transplantation or other malignancy within 5 years.
Drug Administration

R1507 was administered intravenously at a dose of 9
mg=kg in 100 mL normal saline weekly (1 cycle) over 90
minutes during the initial infusion and, in the absence of
any reactions, over 60 minutes during subsequent infusions.
Pharmacokinetic samples

Pharmacokinetic (PK) levels were quantified in serum
using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
(25 ng=mL was used as the lower limit of quantification).
Blood samples (5 mL) were obtained before the first infusion; at the end of the infusion; and 24 hours, 72 to 96
hours, and 168 hours after the infusion in week 1. For
graphic representation of the peak (Cmax) and trough
(Cmin) values throughout the study, data were pooled
from patients with this intense PK schedule and from
patients whose PK samples were drawn with a less intense
schedule during weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 just before dosing and at the end of the infusion.
Pharmacodynamic methods

Serum levels of total IGF-1 were analyzed by ELISA
(DSL-10-5600 Active IGF-I ELISA Kit; Beckman
Coulter, Inc., Jersey City, NJ). Samples were collected
before the first dose and 24 hours after the infusion. Samples also were collected before the second, sixth, and 12th
intravenous doses.
Clinical and Laboratory Investigations

Investigations included a baseline physical examination,
complete blood count, chemistries, pregnancy test, electrocardiogram, antihuman antibodies, imaging for tumor
measurements, and a positron emission tomography scan,
which was repeated at day 9 and at week 18 for responders
according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria.22 Subsequent physical examinations, complete blood
counts, and chemistries were performed weekly for 6
weeks and every 3 weeks thereafter. Tumor imaging was
performed every 6 weeks 4 times and every 12 weeks
thereafter. Tumor imaging was centrally reviewed.
Response to therapy was evaluated using WHO criteria.22 Off-study criteria included progressive disease,

stop if there were no responders in that subtype; otherwise, 10 more patients would be accrued to that subtype. The null hypothesis of a 5% response rate would
be rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis of a
30% response rate if >3 of 20 patients responded.
With a sample size of 20 eligible patients per cohort,
the power to detect a 30% response rate was 94.5%
with a 1-sided a of 1.5%. The probability of early termination was 60% if the true response rate was 5%.
R1507 serum-concentration time data were analyzed using noncompartmental analyses (WinNonlin
release 5.2.1; Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View,
Calif). End-of-infusion samples were used to estimate the
peak concentration (Cmax), and trough values (Cmin) were
determined from predose samples. The following pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated: area under the
concentration curve to the last measured time point
(AUC at 0-168 hours), clearance, and volume of distribution. The dosing schedule relative to the half-life did not
allow for appropriate estimation of the elimination halflife (t1=2).
RESULTS
From December 31, 2007 through August 2009, 163 eligible patients from 33 institutions were enrolled and
treated (Fig. 1). The median age at the time of enrollment
was 31 years (range, 7-85 years). Overall, 30 patients
(18%) were aged <18 years; and RMS and OS histologies
accounted for the majority of these cases (Table 1).

Statistical Methods

The primary endpoint was the best objective response,
which was assessed separately within each of the different strata: OS, RMS, synovial sarcoma, and other sarcomas (alveolar soft part sarcoma, clear cell sarcoma,
desmoplastic small round cell tumor, extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, and myxoid liposarcoma).
Progression-free survival at 18 weeks was a secondary
objective. On the basis of the design of Green and
Dahlberg,23 a maximum of 35 patients would be
needed for the OS, RMS, and synovial sarcoma subtypes. The trial would stop if zero of 20 eligible patients
achieved a response after the first stage; the probability
of early termination was 12% if the true response rate
was 10%. The null hypothesis would be rejected after
the second stage if >7 of 35 patients responded. With a
sample size of 35, the power to detect a 30% response
rate was 87% with a 1-sided a of 2%. For “other
sarcomas,” an analysis that considered each subtype separately was undertaken. A minimum of 10 eligible
patients were accrued to each group, and the trial would

Study Treatment

In total, 1813 doses were administered to 163 patients.
The median number of treatment cycles was 6 (range, 1108 cycles) per patient: 38 patients with OS received 2 to
108 cycles or more, 23 patients with synovial sarcoma
received 2 to 59 cycles, 36 patients with RMS received 2
to 25 cycles, and 66 patients with other sarcomas received
between 1 and 71 cycles. The median dose of R1507 per
patient in mg=kg was 9.1 (range, 8.3-9.9 mg=kg).
Tumor Response and Clinical Outcome

The overall objective response rate was 2.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7%-6.2%). Partial responses were
observed in 4 patients, including 2 patients with OS, 1
patient with RMS (embryonal subtype), and 1 patient
with an alveolar soft part sarcoma (Figs. 2, 3; Table 2).
The median duration of response was 12 weeks (range,
12.3-24 weeks), and responses were observed at 6 weeks
in 2 patients and at 12 weeks in the remaining 2 patients.

1 patient with myxoid liposarcoma had initial dramatic

time of the next assessment; and 2 additional patients (1
with RMS and 1 with myxoid liposarcoma) had partial
responses at the week-18 disease assessments, but they
were not confirmed at later assessments. Stable disease was
observed in 26% of patients, including approximately
one-third of patients in the other sarcoma category (41%
of those with alveolar soft part sarcoma, 32% of those
with extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, 19% of those
with desmoplastic small round cell tumor, and 10% of
those with myxoid liposarcoma), with a median duration
of 6.5 weeks. For all eligible patients, median overall survival was 11.2 months (95% CI, 9.4-13.1 months), and

progression-free survival was 5.7 weeks (95% CI, 5.6-5.9
weeks). Only 17% of patients (95% CI, 11.2%-22.6%)
were progression-free at 12 weeks, and 7% (95% CI,
3.4%-11.4%) were progression-free at 24 weeks. The
progression-free survival rates for patients with different
histologies are depicted in Figure 4. There were 22
patients (10 with OS, 7 with other sarcomas, 4 with synovial sarcoma, and 1 with RMS) who were alive more than
2 years after enrollment on the protocol. These patients
received a median of 10 doses of R1507 (range, 5-108
doses). One patient was still receiving therapy after 175
weeks of treatment. There was no correlation between
response to therapy at week 12 and progression-free
survival.

Pharmacokinetics

Figure 5A illustrates the mean concentration time profile
observed after the first 9-mg=kg weekly dose. R1507 concentrations decreased to reach a mean trough (Cmin) value
of 62 lg=mL within the first dosing interval. On the basis
of the first dose, mean 6 standard deviation Cmax values
of 216.8 6 90.8 lg=mL, an AUC from 0 to 168 hours of
17,329 6 9682 lg*hour=mL, a volume of distribution of
56.2 6 17.8 L=kg, and a clearance of 8.5 6 2.5 mL per

R1507 PK studies.18,20 These PK parameters were determined using data from 40 patients, and the interpatient
variability (coefficient of variation percentage) ranged
from 30% to 42%. Both Cmax and Cmin values increased
over the course of 12 weeks, and there was some evidence
of a PK plateau after 6 weeks of treatment (Fig. 5B).These
results are consistent with estimates of a previously
reported long elimination half-life.20 The observations of
the respective Cmin and Cmax values were made by using
all patients who had data available, including N 5 155
and 142 patients (week 1), respectively; 144 and 140
patients (week 2), respectively; 139 and 37 patients (week
4), respectively; 108 and 106 patients (week 6), respectively; 13 and 12 patients (week 9), and 42 and 35 patients
(week 12), respectively. Percentage changes in total IGF-1
levels from baseline are illustrated in Figure 6.
Prognostic Factors

Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified that an
IGF-1 level >110 ng=mL, a Karnofsky performance status >90%, older age at diagnosis, and a diagnosis of OS
were associated with longer survival (Table 3, Fig. 4).
Among 92 patients who had samples available for analysis
at week 6 of therapy, there were no significant associations
between levels or changes in total IGF-1 and clinical
outcome.

investigating the activity of a monoclonal antibody against
the IGF-1R. Our study demonstrates that R1507 has limited activity in selected bone and soft tissue sarcomas and
has a very favorable toxicity profile. In our study, 2.5% of
patients experienced a measurable objective response as
defined by WHO criteria, and only 17% were
progression-free at 12 weeks, suggesting that the drug is
inactive in these patient groups.24 However, a careful
analysis of our data demonstrates that patients with RMS
and OS may benefit from this therapy, and further study
appears to be warranted in these subgroups (Fig. 2). The
results of other published sarcoma trials using various
monoclonal antibodies directed against IGF-1R are provided in Table 5.17,18,21,25-27
It is unclear why clinical responses were disappointingly low in our study. From our data, we were able to
identify distinct subsets of patients that responded differently to IGF-1R–blocking therapy. The first group, which
accounted for about 66% of patients, failed to exhibit a
clinical response and progressed after a median of 2 cycles
of R1507. It is possible that these patients have low levels
of IGF-1R receptors,13 as recently demonstrated in ES
cell lines by flow cytometry,28 and=or intrinsic expression
or activation of macrophage-stimulating 1 receptor
(MST1R). MST1R is a met proto-oncogene (MET)related protein tyrosine kinase expressed in 48% of
embryonal RMS and 71% of alveolar RMS. It modulates
IGF-1R activity through the activation of ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6) and may be a mechanism of innate resistance to anti-IGF-1R therapy.29 Additional resistance
mechanisms may include constitutively up-regulated
phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) and=or mammalian target
of rapamycin (mTOR) secondary to the up-regulation of
TORC2 (CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2) or

a compensatory switch that favors IGF-II=IR-A dependency.30,31 Laboratory studies to elucidate these potential
mechanisms are currently being performed on collected
tissue specimens. Approximately 25% of our patients in
the other sarcoma category had stable disease; however
this was short lived (about 6 weeks) and included patients
who had tumors that are known for their indolent clinical
course, such as alveolar soft part sarcoma. Thus, the clinical benefit of this agent in this patient group could not be
accurately assessed. A small group of patients had dramatic and sustained responses to R1507. This group likely
had tumors that expressed high levels of IGF-1R receptors, lacked insulin receptor expression, had low levels of
BCL-2, and also may have had decreased or absent expression of MST1R.21,32,33 A third group of patients had

subsequent activation of alternative signaling pathways,
which may include platelet-derived growth factor receptor
(PDGFR), v-erb-b2 avian erythroblastic leukemia viral
oncogene homolog 2 (ERBB2), epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR), or MET.34-36 The latter mechanism of
resistance is being recognized increasingly in a variety of
tumor systems.37 Finally, the low response rates observed
in our trial could have been related to inadequate drug
dosing, because R1507 tumor biodistribution reportedly
was correlated with tumor response in a panel of sarcoma
xenografts using immuno–single-photon emission computed tomography imaging.38 The initial dose of 9 mg=kg
per week was based on phase 1 studies that demonstrated
a median half-life of 8 to 10 days in concentrations that
exceeded 20 lg=mL,20 a concentration expected to saturate >90% of the IGF-1 receptors. Our current data are
consistent with previous observations.18 However,
ongoing PK studies suggest that high serum peak levels
are more important and that dosing 27 mg=kg every 3

weeks appears to be more efficacious than the same dose
divided weekly.18
The median overall survival in our patients was 13
months. This is similar to the survival reported in other
studies for patients with advanced RMS, OS, and synovial
sarcomas, emphasizing the critical need for effective therapies in the relapsed setting. Although R1507 is much less
toxic than more the traditional cytotoxic chemotherapies
used for these malignancies in the refractory setting, the
response rates are lower.
Although the company has halted development of
this drug, we believe that IGF-1R inhibitors may play a
role in the treatment of selected sarcomas, particularly ES
and RMS. However, it will be crucial to incorporate the
development of both positive and negative prospective
biomarkers into future clinical studies. For example, some
tumors have undetectable levels of the IGF-1R on their
surface, which would lead to a prediction that such
patients would be unlikely to respond to IGF-1R blockade. Thus, the incorporation of a sensitive, quantitative
assay for the expression of the IGF-1R as a selection criteria would likely lead to an increase in response rates.
Unfortunately, the presence of the IGF-1R does not

positively predict a response to anti-IGF-1R therapy, and
predictive biomarkers of response clearly are needed. This
probably will require prospective biopsies before entry on
study so that tumors can be studied for activation of signaling pathways that hopefully could identify predictors
of response. Furthermore, such analysis also may help to
identify the potential activation of resistance pathways,
leading to rational combination therapies that could
include mTOR inhibitors, vascular endothelial growth
factor inhibitors, EGFR inhibitors, and=or Src family kinase inhibitors.39-43
