Abstract
A series of nitrofuran-based compounds were identified as
inhibitors of estrogen signaling in a cell-based, high-throughput screen of a diverse library of small molecules. These highly
related compounds were subsequently found to inhibit
topoisomerase II in vitro at concentrations similar to that
required for the inhibition of estrogen signaling in cells. The
most potent nitrofuran discovered is f10-fold more active
than etoposide phosphate, a topoisomerase II inhibitor in
clinical use. The nitrofurans also inhibit topoisomerase I
activity, with f20-fold less activity. Moreover, the nitrofurans,
in contrast to etoposide, induce a profound cell cycle arrest in
the G0-G1 phase of the cell cycle, do not induce doublestranded DNA breaks, are not substrates for multidrug
resistance protein-1 export from the cell, and are amenable
to synthetic development. In addition, the nitrofurans
synergize with etoposide phosphate in cell killing. Clonogenic
assays done on a panel of human tumors maintained ex vivo in
nude mice show that the most active compound identified in
the screen is selective against tumors compared with normal
hematopoietic stem cells. However, this compound had only
moderate activity in a mouse xenograft model. This novel class
of topoisomerase II inhibitor may provide additional chemotherapeutic strategies for the development of cytotoxic agents
with proven clinical utility. [Cancer Res 2007;67(9):4451–8]

a component of the transcription factor IID complex (6) and binds
to nucleolin (7), SV40 T antigen (7), p53 (8), and heat shock protein
70 (9). Moreover, estrogen-dependent restructuring and transcriptional competence of the pS2 promoter has been shown to require
the generation of a DNA double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) break that
is promoted by topoisomerase IIh and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (10). Collectively, these findings indicate that topoisomerases
have a significant role in transcriptional processes.
Encouraged by proof of concept studies with histone deacetylase
inhibitors that they could phenocopy the effect of antiestrogens
and with the extent of the complexity of estrogen signaling (5), we
did a cell-based, unbiased, high-throughput screen against a highly
diverse compound library to discover novel small molecules that
either activate or inhibit estrogen signaling. Six related nitrofuran
derivatives were identified in the screen which inhibit estrogen
signaling at micromolar levels and are overtly cytotoxic to dividing
cells. These nitrofurans inhibit estrogen signaling and are potent
inhibitors of topoisomerase II and, to a lesser extent, of
topoisomerase I. These nitrofurans do not induce dsDNA breaks
in cells, as detected by the phosphorylation of H2AX, an early
marker of DNA damage. Prospectively, this indicates that the
nitrofurans may be less mutagenic than etoposide. Moreover, unlike
etoposide, which is derived from natural sources, the nitrofurans are
chemically tractable, perhaps allowing their physiochemical properties to be modified to provide suitable clinical candidates.

Introduction

Materials and Methods

Transcription of estrogen-responsive genes is a complex,
dynamic process that consists of repeated cycles of initiation by
estrogen receptor a (ERa), recruitment and activation of DNA
polymerase II, followed by limitation of transcription (1–4). The
latter events are mediated by processes generally regarded as
repressive; in particular, histone deacetylases (HDAC) and histone
demethylases, in association with the SWI/SNF or the NuRD
complex, remodel local chromatin structure to restrict transcriptional engagement. The complexity and cyclical nature of these
events suggests that it may be possible to modulate estrogen
signaling by using not only small molecules that directly interact
with the ER but also with small molecules that target other
processes involved in transcriptional cycling. We have provided
proof of concept of this hypothesis with HDAC inhibitors, which
have a profound antiestrogenic effect in the ERa-positive breast
adenocarcinoma cell line MCF-7 (5). Additionally, topoisomerases I
and II are engaged in transcriptional processes. Topoisomerase I is

Reagents and antibodies. Etoposide, etoposide phosphate, camptothecin, propidium iodide, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) were purchased from Sigma. DMSO was purchased
from Merck and vincristine sulphate from Calbiochem. Anti–phosphoH2AX (Ser139) was purchased from Abcam. Anti-ERa (HC20) was purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. Topoisomerase I was purchased from
GE Healthcare and topoisomerase IIa was bought from USB. Topoisomerase
II activity was also analyzed using material purchased from Topogen. The
nitrofurans described in this article were prepared by Tripos as custom
synthesis and supplied at a chemical purity of >90% by liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry UV at 254 nm with structures
confirmed by elemental analysis and by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance.
Topoisomerase I and II assays. These assays were done according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 0.5 Ag supercoiled DNA, 1 unit
topoisomerase I, and the compounds under investigation were incubated
for 30 min at 30jC in 35 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 72 mmol/L KCl, 5 mmol/L
MgCl2, 5 mmol/L DTT, 5 mmol/L spermidine, and 0.01% bovine serum
albumin (BSA). The reactions were stopped by the addition of 6 loading dye
solution (Fermentas) and then subjected to electrophoresis on 0.7% agarose
gels, with or without ethidium bromide. Topoisomerase II assays were done
as above except that 125 ng supercoiled DNA and 4 units topoisomerase II,
together with the chemical compounds under investigation, were incubated
for 30 min at 30jC in 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mmol/L NaCl,
50 mmol/L KCl, 5 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA, 15 Ag/AL BSA, and
1 mmol/L ATP.

Also shown, for comparison, are the structures of furaltadone and nitrofurantoin, two nitrofurans used as anti-infective agents.

Cell lines, cell culture, and transfections. MCF-7, HEKPC7, and
HEKMRP1 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS.
Hygromycin (100 Ag/mL) was used to maintain expression within the MRP1
stable cell line. The HEKPC7 and HEKMRP1 cell lines (11) were a generous
gift of Dr. Roger Deeley (Queen’s University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada).
Transfections were done using polyethylenimine (12).
Histone preparation and Western blot analysis. Cells (2  105) were
seeded in six-well dishes and treated with test compounds for 16 h.
Subsequently, 0.5 mL of 0.2 mol/L H2SO4 was applied onto the cells for
5 min. The cells were scraped, incubated on ice for 10 min, and then spun at
14,000 rpm for 15 min. The lysate was collected and proteins were
precipitated by the addition of 0.25 volume of 100% trichloroacetic acid.
After 10-min incubation on ice, precipitated proteins were collected by

centrifugation. The pellets were washed with 1 mL chloroform, air dried,
and then resuspended in 100 AL water. Sample (50 AL) was then resolved by
electrophoresis on 15% SDS-PAGE; proteins were then transferred on a
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore) for analysis by
immunostaining.
For analysis by Western blot, after a 16-h treatment with compounds,
cells were washed twice with PBS and directly lysed in sample buffer.
Viscosity was reduced by brief sonication and proteins were resolved on a
10% SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were transferred onto PVDF membrane, which
was then subsequently blocked with casein, then incubated 2 h with
primary antibody. Anti–phospho-H2AX (Ser139) was diluted to 130 ng/mL
and anti-ERa to 66 ng/mL. The membrane was then washed and incubated
for 1 h with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase–conjugated

secondary antibody (DiaNova) and visualized by chemiluminescence with
the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham).
Cell cycle analysis. Cytometric measurement of intracellular DNA
content was done using propidium iodide staining (13); in essence, cells
were trypsinized, permeabilized, stained, and subjected to flow cytometry
with 10,000 events recorded. Cell fragments and aggregates of cells,
identified by side scattering, were excluded from the analysis.
Chemosensitivity testing. The MTT assay was used to indirectly
estimate cellular proliferation through mitochondrial reduction to the
corresponding tetrazolium salt. In essence, 3,000 cells per well were seeded
in a 96-well plate in medium supplemented with 10% FCS. They were
exposed to test compounds 24 h later and then incubated for an additional
72 h before incubation with MTT for 3 h. DMSO concentrations were
identical in all samples. Absorbance was determined at 550 nm. Two or
more independent experiments were carried out, and within each
experiment, estimations were done in quadruplicate.

Results
The European Molecular Biology Laboratory-German Cancer
Research Center (EMBL-DKFZ) small-molecule library was
screened against a cell-based assay in the ERa-positive cell line
MCF-7, which was transfected with an ERE-tk-luc reporter plasmid
that expresses luciferase under the control of an estrogenresponsive promoter (14). Approximately 55,000 compounds were
screened in 96-well format at a concentration of 4 Amol/L for an
incubation period of 24 h. Around 1% of compounds inhibited
luciferase production by greater than three times the SD of the
assay. All compounds that potentially modulated estrogen
signaling were subsequently validated in a counterscreen to

exclude compounds that directly inhibit luciferase activity. Of the
confirmed inhibitors, six contained a nitrofuran group. Their
structures, associated IC (inhibitory constant) 50’s and GI (growth
inhibition) 50’s against estrogen signaling and growth of MCF-7
cells, respectively, are shown in Table 1. We then concentrated on
the most active member of this series, EMBL-153441, to evaluate
the functional and mechanistic properties of this series of
compounds. Importantly, the activity of EMBL-153441 on resynthesis gave similar values to the library compound in cell-based
inhibition of estrogen signaling and in cytotoxicity assays.
The nitrofurans EMBL-102840 or EMBL-153441 and known
inhibitors of either topoisomerase I or topoisomerase II activity
abrogate ERa protein levels and compromise estrogen signaling in
cell-based assays (Fig. 1C and D). Based on these findings, we
systematically evaluated the nitrofurans identified from the screen
in topoisomerase assays. As shown in Fig. 1B and C, EMBL-153441
inhibits topoisomerase II in both a decatonation assay, where
induction of a dsDNA break is a prerequisite for activity, and in a
plasmid relaxation assay. Indeed, the only nitrofuran found not to
inhibit topoisomerase II activity is EMBL-153448, the least active
member of the nitrofurans discovered in screen (data not shown).
Moreover, concomitant addition of etoposide and EMBL-153441
results in greater inhibition that either compound alone, perhaps
suggesting that each molecule targets a different site on topoisomerase II. Neither furaltadone nor nitrofurantoin, nitrofurans
that are used as antibacterial agents (see Table 1 for structures),
inhibits human topoisomerase II to appreciable levels (data not
shown). In conclusion, the in vitro activity of EMBL-153441 on the

Figure 1. Inhibitors of topoisomerase I and II and the nitrofurans identified induced clearance of ERa protein from MCF-7 cells and inhibit topoisomerase II activity
in vitro . Western blot analysis of ERa protein levels in MCF-7 cells shows that 16 h of treatment with an inhibitor of topoisomerase I activity (camptothecin; 1 Amol/L)
and topoisomerase II activity (etoposide phosphate; 20 Amol/L) or with the nitrofurans EMBL-102840 and EMBL-153441 (10 Amol/L) results in complete loss of ERa
protein (A ). Incubation of cells with the pure antiestrogen faslodex, topoisomerase inhibitors, or with EMBL-102842 or EMBL-15344 also compromises estrogen
signaling in a cell-based reporter assay where luciferase expression is under control of an estrogen-responsive promoter (B). Topoisomerase II activity, through
introducing dsDNA breaks, has the ability to resolve concatenated kinetoplast DNA. This process is inhibited by micromolar concentrations of EMBL-153441 (C ).
This effect is also seen in a plasmid relaxation assay (D), where f10-fold more etoposide is required to produce inhibition of topoisomerase II than EMBL-153441.
Moreover, some evidence of cooperativity between etoposide and EMBL-153441 on coaddition is apparent (D ).

Figure 2. Nitrofurans also inhibit
topoisomerase I activity in vitro .
Topoisomerase I activity was evaluated in
a plasmid relaxation assay, using
camptothecin as a known inhibitor.
A, whereas the topoisomerase II inhibitor
etoposide does not inhibit topoisomerase I,
the nitrofuran EMBL-153441 does inhibit,
albeit with >10-fold less activity than the
inhibition of topoisomerase II. B, the
activity of all six nitrofurans identified in the
screen in inhibiting topoisomerase I

compound in inhibition of estrogen
signaling and topoisomerase I and
topoisomerase II activity is identical in
all three assays.

inhibition of topoisomerase II is generally concordant with its cellbased activity in inhibiting estrogen signaling or in cellular
cytotoxicity; in particular, EMBL-153441 is f10-fold more active
than etoposide.
We also evaluated the ability of EMBL-153441 to inhibit
topoisomerase I activity, using a plasmid relaxation assay and
camptothecin as a positive control. As shown in Fig. 2, EMBL153441 does inhibit topoisomerase I activity, albeit with f10-fold
less activity than the in vitro inhibition of topoisomerase II.
Additionally, four of the other five nitrofurans discovered in the
screen also inhibit topoisomerase I activity, generally in the 10 to
50 Amol/L range (Fig. 2).
We then characterized the effect that EMBL-153441 had on the
distribution of cells within the cell cycle and found that EMBL153441 induces a G1-G0 cell cycle arrest, in contrast to etoposide,
which induces arrest in the G2-M phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 3A).
DNA repair machinery will attempt to repair etoposide-induced
dsDNA damage, through an initial recruitment of histone H2AX
followed by its subsequent phosphorylation on Ser139 (15). We
used this effect as a surrogate marker to ascertain if EMBL153441, like etoposide, induces DNA damage. As shown in Fig. 3B,
EMBL-153441, in contrast to etoposide, does not induce
phosphorylation of histone H2AX. Collectively, arrest in G0-G1

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (9). May 1, 2007

and lack of observable DNA damage suggest that EMBL-153441
has a different mechanism of action on topoisomerase II than
that of etoposide. By implication, this suggests that etoposide and
EMBL-153441 may synergize with each other, if each target
different sites on topoisomerase II. We first determined dose
concentration curves for both compounds and used these to
simulate the result of an additive effect on the inhibition of cell
growth (Fig. 3C, left). The observed result indicates that the extent
of inhibition induced by concomitant addition of etoposide
phosphate and EMBL-153441 is greater than that anticipated for a
purely additive effective, with a modest synergy occurring, with
each compound increasing the activity of the other by f3-fold
(Fig. 3C, right).
Resistance to etoposide, with concomitant cross-resistance to a
range of cytotoxic agents, including the anthracyclines, epipodophyllotoxins and Vinca alkaloids, is a frequent clinical outcome to
treatment (16). Two classes of proteins, P-glycoprotein and
multidrug resistance protein (MRP), members of the ATP binding
cassette transporter superfamily, are predominantly responsible for
these effects. We used a matched pair of cell lines (11), to evaluate
if EMBL-153441 is a substrate for MRP-1 action. As shown in Fig. 4,
although expression of MRP-1 induces an f10-fold increase in
resistance to etoposide, it does not induce significant resistance

to EMBL-153441, indicating that an increase in MRP-1 expression
does not compromise cell killing induced by EMBL-143441.
We then addressed the capability of EMBL-153441 to inhibit the
growth of human tumors maintained in nude mice, both in an
ex vivo colony-forming assay and in vivo. Xenografts, as described
previously (17), were selected to represent a range of human tumor
types. EMBL-153441 and etoposide phosphate were profiled for
dose responsiveness against nine human tumor xenografts as
follows: colon cancer, CXF 280; non–small cell lung cancers, LXFE
1422 and LXFL 529; small cell lung cancer, LXFS 650; mammary
cancers, MAXF 1322, MAXF 401, and MAXF 857; ovarian cancer,
OVXF 1353; and renal cancer, RXF 944LX. Also tested was the
response of human hematopoietic stem cells, obtained from
umbilical cord blood, to both compounds. The average concentration required to inhibit colony formation in this panel of cell types
by 50%, 70%, and 90% are shown in Table 2. EMBL-153441 is f3-

fold more active than etoposide in inhibiting the growth of this
panel of cells. Moreover, the difference between the average efficacy
of EMBL-153441 and etoposide phosphate increases to f4-fold (4.0
versus 14.6 Amol/L GI70s), when hematopoietic cells are excluded
from the data set.
The individual response of each cell type is presented on a
logarithmic scale relative to the mean inhibition (GI50) of the test
panel (Fig. 5A). In this analysis, more sensitive cell types have bars
to the left of the mean value, with bars to the right indicative of cell
types more resistant to that of average. Mean graph analysis can be
used to generate a fingerprint of the antiproliferative profile of a
compound. Although the profiles for both compounds are generally
concordant, specific differences do occur. Notably, hematopoietic
stem cells are, in relative terms, f30-fold more sensitive to
etoposide phosphate than to EMBL-153441. We selected the most
sensitive cell type, LXFS 650, derived from a small cell lung

Figure 3. EMBL-153441 induces an
accumulation of cells in the G0-G1 phase
of the cell cycle, does not induce
double-stranded breaks in DNA, and shows
moderate synergy with etoposide
phosphate in inhibiting cell growth. MCF-7
cells were treated for 16 h with either
DMSO solvent control, 1 Amol/L faslodex
(a potent inhibitor of estrogen signaling that
binds to the ERa), 50 Amol/L etoposide
phosphate, or 10 Amol/L EMBL-153441.
Cells were taken into suspension, fixed,
permeabilized, and treated with RNase,
and their DNA was stained with
diaminopropidium iodide. The stained
suspension was then subjected to analysis
by flow cytometry, with 10,000 events
recorded for each condition. As expected,
faslodex induces an increase in the
proportion of cells in the G0-G1 phase of the
cell cycle, with etoposide phosphate
inducing an accumulation of cells in G2-M.
EMBL-153441 induces a profound G0-G1
arrest, with a considerable reduction in
cells in S phase (A). We then compared, by
Western blot analysis, the induction of
phosphorylated H2AX, a marker of dsDNA
breaks, on treatment of MCF-7 cells for
16 h with DMSO solvent control, etoposide
phosphate (50 Amol/L), or EMBL-153441
(10 Amol/L). Only etoposide induced H2AX
phosphorylation, indicating that at doses
that inhibit estrogen signaling and cell
growth, EMBL-153441 does not induce
DNA damage (B). We then evaluated if
synergy occurs between etoposide
phosphate and EMBL-15344. Independent
dose response curves were determined
for etoposide phosphate and for
EMBL-153441. These were used to
simulate a purely additive effect (left ) of
adding both drugs to MCF-7 cells. This is
compared with the actual results (right )
obtained in a checkerboard experiment that
estimated the inhibition of cell growth
obtained with combinations of etoposide
phosphate and EMBL-153441 (C ). There is
a clear, although modest, synergy between
etoposide phosphate and EMBL-153441,
where each enhances the inhibitory effect
of the other by f3-fold.

Figure 4. EMBL-153441 is not subject to cellular resistance by MRP-1. A matched pair of human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, parental and a stable cell line
expressing MRP-1, were used to determine if EMBL-153441 is subject to cellular export by MRP-1. Although MRP-1 overexpression decreases the sensitivity of HEK
cells to etoposide (A), as determined by mitochondrial reduction of MTT, it does not alter sensitivity to EMBL-153441 (B ), indicating that this later compound is not a
substrate for MRP-1 export.

carcinoma tumor, to study in a nude mouse/human tumor
xenograft model. Before commencing these studies, a series of
doses of EMBL-153441 was administered by the i.p. route to mice
to ascertain a maximum tolerated dose (MTD), defined as the dose
that resulted in a 10% loss of body weight. The MTD was found to
be 100 mg/kg. As shown in Fig. 4B, despite having an ex vivo IC90 of
f120 nmol/L against the LXFS 650 tumor in the colony-forming
assay, only moderate antitumor activity was obtained with EMBL153441 administered daily by i.p. at a dose of 100 mg/kg. This
result, in conjunction with the high MTD of EMBL-153441, suggests
that optimization of the physiochemical variables, especially to
improve aqueous solubility, is necessary to obtain improve activity.

Discussion
We report the discovery of a novel class of topoisomerase II
inhibitor, linear nitrofurans, which inhibit topoisomerase II activity
in vitro with IC50 values in the low micromolar range. These
compounds are generally cytotoxic to cells and seem to inhibit
topoisomerase II through a mechanism distinct from etoposide. We
have named this class of compound thanatop, from the Greek word
thanatos (death) and top ( from topoisomerase).
Etoposide, a semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin isolated
from the American mandrake (Podophyllum peltatum), has been in
clinical use for more than two decades. Etoposide inhibits
topoisomerase IIa and topoisomerase IIh late in the catalytic
cycle, when the enzyme acts to religate the dsDNA break that
permits changes in the topological status of DNA. Consequently,
topoisomerase II inhibited by etoposide functions to allow DNA
replication to occur but provokes a mitotic crash in late G2.
Etoposide may primarily kill cells by stabilizing a covalent enzymecleaved DNA complex, known as the cleavage complex. The
accumulation of cleavage complexes in treated cells leads to the
generation of permanent DNA strand breaks, which trigger
recombination/repair pathways, mutagenesis, and chromosomal
translocations. When such breaks overwhelm the cell, they initiate
apoptotic pathways. In consequence, etoposide converts topoisomerase II from an essential enzyme to a potent cellular toxin
that fragments the genome. Chromosomal rearrangements involving the breakpoint cluster region of the mixed lineage leukemia

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (9). May 1, 2007

(MLL) gene on chromosome 11q23 are a hallmark of therapyrelated acute myeloid leukemias that are induced by etoposide (18).
Etoposide-induced acute myelogenous leukemia, usually involving
the breakpoint cluster region of the MLL gene on chromosome
11q23, is a severe consequence of therapy that occurs in 2% to 12%
of patients (19). Other major adverse effects of treatment with
etoposide are myelosuppression and cardiotoxicity.
Nitrofurans have a long and somewhat checkered history as
antibiotics in human therapy. Although they undoubtedly have
immense therapeutic value as broad spectrum antimicrobial
agents (20), with resistance to nitrofurans being an infrequent
occurrence, nitrofurans are now regarded as being sufficiently
mutagenic to preclude their use in human treatment for infections
or in the treatment of animals in the human food supply (21). The
generally accepted mechanism of action of nitrofurans as antibiotics is that they are reduced by bacterial nitroreductases to
highly reactive metabolites that then covalently react with and
poison essential components of the bacterial cellular machinery
(22, 23). We therefore wished to determine if the nitrofurans
identified as inhibitors of estrogen signaling did so specifically;
three nitrofurans (i.e., EMBL-153448, furaltadone, and nitrofurantoin) had relatively poor or no inhibition of estrogen signaling

(Table 1) and also did not inhibit human topoisomerase I or II
activity at 100 Amol/L (data not shown), indicating that the
nitrofuran group alone is insufficient to inhibit topoisomerase
activity. In addition, activity was seen in vitro using purified
topoisomerases under conditions where reduction of the nitrofuran
is unlikely. From these observations, we conclude that the active
nitrofurans specifically inhibit topoisomerase II, although we
cannot currently preclude that they act on additional targets.
Although the nitrofuran moiety is a known mutagen, it may be that,
as the nitrofurans do not directly induce dsDNA breaks, they may
be less prone to provoke treatment-induced leukemias than
etoposide. Given the severity of most cancers and their high
unmet clinical need, nitrofurans may remain suitable therapeutic
agents for cancer if sufficient activity and pharmacologic properties
can be attained.
Nitrofurans have been described previously as antiproliferative
agents (24, 25), although the mechanism of action was not
demonstrated. Both articles report cytotoxic effects on cells that
are of the same order as those reported in this article. Inhibition of
growth in an in vivo mouse i.p. tumor/i.p. challenge model was also
observed, with cell growth transiently inhibited following a single
administration of nitrofuran. Additionally, 5-nitrofuran derivatives
of fatty acid hydrazides induce a G0-G1 arrest in the cell cycle of
human myeloid leukemic cell lines (25). One plausible explanation
for an accumulation of cells in G1, reflecting the difference in the
mechanistic action of the nitrofurans and etoposide, is that
nitrofurans prevent DNA replication through debilitating topoisomerase II activity early in the catalytic cycle. Cells may then
proceed through the cell cycle until halted by a block in DNA
replication. This possibility is consistent with the profound
suppression of cells in S phase when treated with EMBL-153441
(Fig. 3A).
EMBL-153441 inhibited the panel of human cell lines evaluated
with f3-fold greater activity at the IC70 value than etoposide

phosphate. Strikingly, and in contrast to etoposide phosphate,
human hematopoietic stem cells were, compared with the most
sensitive cell types, relatively nonsensitive to EMBL-153441. In
absolute terms, etoposide phosphate was f30-fold more toxic to
human hematopoietic stem cells than EMBL-15344. In vivo
profiling of EMBL-153441 in a nude mouse xenograft model, with
the tumor placed subdermal between the scapulae, was challenged
by once daily dosing at 100 mg/kg and showed a moderate
reduction in tumor volume over a 14-day period. Given the
sensitivity of the tumor in the colony-forming assay (GI90 of 120
nmol/L), this result indicates that the administered compound had
poor access to the tumor. In particular, EMBL-153444 has very
limited solubility (f25 Ag/mL in PBS; data not shown) and had to
be administered i.p. using DMSO as solvent carrier. Further
optimization of this compound series will concentrate on
modifying the physiochemical properties to enhance potency, but
in particular, their drug-like characteristics, to ensure an increase
in the systemic distribution, availability, and persistence of
compound. This may be entirely feasible, as it seems that
considerable variation at the end of the molecule that opposes
the nitrofuran group can be tolerated without loss of potency (data
not shown).
Primary lung tumors (small cell and non–small cell lung
adenocarcinomas) are often characterized by preliminary chemosensitivity, with initial patient response rates >80% achieved with
combination chemotherapy; however, long-term survival is very
poor, with 5-year survival rates between 5% to 10% (26). The
consistent and rapid emergence of drug resistance in lung cancer
compromises treatment, which can be overcome by dose escalation,
to 5- to 10-fold higher doses. At such chemotherapeutic intensity, a
deleterious effect on hematopoiesis becomes limiting and requires
supportive intervention, such as autologous bone marrow transplantation. Additionally, suitable combinations of non–cross-resistant
agents may preclude resistance. Such principles of elevated dosing

Figure 5. EMBL-153441 inhibits the growth of human tumors in colony-forming assays and in a nude mouse xenograft model. The effect of EMBL-153441,
compared with etoposide phosphate, on an ex vivo panel of human tumors was determined. A panel of nine human tumors was maintained as xenografts in nude mice,
which were excised, disaggregated, and used to seed plates where the medium was immobilized with 0.75% agar. Colonies, arising from the tumor stem cell population,
were allowed to grow to a diameter of >50 Am, after which they were stained and counted. Normal human hematopoietic stem cells, obtained from cord blood, were
used to indicate the myelosuppressive effect of test compounds. Mean graph analysis of the individual cell types under evaluation show that EMBL-153441 and
etoposide phosphate have a generally similar response profile, with primary lung tumors most sensitive to both compounds (A). Human hematopoietic stem cells
are f30-fold more sensitive to etoposide phosphate than to EMBL-153441. We then evaluated the most sensitive tumor, LXFS 650, in a xenograft/nude mouse
model. Fragments of tumor were implanted s.c. between the scapulae and allowed to grow to a volume of f100 mm3, after which daily i.p. administration of
EMBL-153441 at 100 mg/kg in DMSO, or solvent control, was initiated. A modest reduction in tumor growth was seen with the nitrofuran EMBL-153441; Points, tumor
volume; bars, 95% values of variation within each data set (B ).

and combination chemotherapy, established in laboratory models,
have resulted in the design of effective regimes for the treatment of
several tumor types (26).
In light of these considerations, particularly as EMBL-153441 is
not subject to cellular resistance through MRP-1, the nitrofuran class
of topoisomerase inhibitor has potential in the rational combination
chemotherapeutic regimes. In particular, use with etoposide merits
further consideration. Etoposide and the nitrofurans inhibit topoisomerase II through different mechanisms. This is reflected in the
synergy that exists between both compounds in cell killing. Although
the effect is modest, at f3-fold, it is greater than an additive effect
and would be significant if translated into the clinic.
The thanatops are a new class of antiproliferative agent that are
synthetically tractable, which target topoisomerase II, and, within

the limited range of compounds identified, also target topoisomerase I, albeit to a lesser extent. The synthetic amenability of
the nitrofurans suggests that further improvements in terms of
potency, drug-like characteristics, and selectivity toward topoisomerase I or II could be achieved to develop potential clinical
candidates.
