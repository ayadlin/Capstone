Androgen Receptor Requires JunD as a Coactivator to Switch
on an Oxidative Stress Generation Pathway in
Prostate Cancer Cells

Abstract
Relatively high oxidative stress levels in the prostate are postulated to be a major factor for prostate carcinogenesis and prostate cancer (CaP) progression. We focused on elucidating metabolic pathways of oxidative stress generation in CaP cells. Previously, we showed that the transcription factor JunD is essential for
androgen-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in androgen-dependent human CaP cells. We also
recently showed that androgen induces the first and regulatory enzyme spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) in a polyamine catabolic pathway that produces copious amounts of metabolic ROS. Here, we
present coimmunoprecipitation and Gaussia luciferase reconstitution assay data that show that JunD forms a
complex with androgen-activated androgen receptor (AR) in situ. Our chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
data show that JunD binds directly to a specific SSAT promoter sequence only in androgen-treated LNCaP
cells. Using a vector containing a luciferase reporter gene connected to the SSAT promoter and a JunDsilenced LNCaP cell line, we show that JunD is essential for androgen-induced SSAT gene expression. The
elucidation of JunD-AR complex inducing SSAT expression leading to polyamine oxidation establishes the
mechanistic basis of androgen-induced ROS production in CaP cells and opens up a new prostate-specific
target for CaP chemopreventive/chemotherapeutic drug development. Cancer Res; 70(11); 4560–8. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Approximately 1% to 5% of the oxygen that we breathe in is
converted to reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2), superoxide, and hydroxyl radical (reviewed
in ref. 1). When cellular ROS production exceeds detoxification capacity, oxidative stress occurs (2, 3). Damage to cellular
proteins, DNA, RNA, and phospholipids due to oxidative
stress (4–9) as well as ROS molecules acting as signals for promoting cell proliferation (10) are believed to contribute to
cancer development. The strongest evidence thus far is
ROS-induced oxidative damage products in human and transgenic mice prostatectomy specimens. Both mouse and
human prostate tumor cells are reported to have higher
ROS-induced macromolecular damages compared with
normal prostatic epithelium (11, 12). Accumulating evidence
shows that ROS play a key role in occurrence and recurrence
of prostate cancer (CaP) as well as its progression from
androgen dependence to androgen independence (11–15).
Androgen signaling is one source of ROS generation in
prostatic epithelial cells (16, 17). Androgen binding to androAuthors' Affiliations: 1University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center

gen receptor (AR) initiates a cascade of events leading to ROS
generation in prostate cells (17–19). We established that one
pathway of androgen-induced oxidative stress involves activation of activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor JunD
(19, 20), followed by induction of enzyme spermidine/
spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) that initiates a major
polyamine oxidation pathway (21). As prostatic epithelia produce a large excess of polyamines, induction of polyamine
oxidation could result in high ROS levels in the prostate.
We have shown that inhibiting androgen-induced ROS production using different small-molecule inhibitors of the
androgen signaling pathway or polyamine oxidation inhibits
cell growth and androgen-induced ROS generation in cultured human CaP cells as well as tumor growth in transgenic
adenocarcinoma in the mouse prostate model (21, 22).4
Because the SSAT gene promoter sequence contains no ARbinding element (ARE), the exact mechanism of how AR may
induce SSAT gene expression remains unknown. To develop
more potent CaP chemopreventive agents that can specifically block this pathway, we focused on elucidating the
mechanism of androgen-induced SSAT gene expression.
We previously showed that androgen activation of AR in
LNCaP human CaP cells induces AP-1 transcription factors
Fra-2 and JunD (19). However, only JunD levels and its functional activity remained elevated for 96 hours after androgen
treatment when androgen-induced oxidative stress was

observed (17–20). JunD may either inhibit (23–25) or help (26)
cellular ROS production depending on cell type, presence of
ROS-generating proteins, growth conditions, etc. Because
androgen-induced ROS generation was abrogated by either
blocking androgen-induced JunD overexpression with antiandrogen bicalutamide or silencing JunD protein expression
using siRNA (19, 20), we concluded that JunD activity is necessary for androgen-induced oxidative stress in LNCaP cells.
Here, we present data clearly showing that (a) JunD is
required for androgen-induced SSAT gene expression,
(b) activated AR interacts with JunD in situ, and (c) JunD binds
directly to the SSAT promoter sequence only in androgentreated human CaP cells. Based on these results, we hypothesize that AR and JunD form a complex that binds to the
SSAT promoter, resulting in SSAT gene expression and consequent high levels of ROS in androgen-treated prostate cells.
Induction of SSAT and polyamine oxidation as a main source
of ROS production in prostatic epithelia was first reported
from our laboratory (27) and further confirmed in our subsequent publication (21). Although other studies implicating
the effect of AR-induced CaP cell growth stimulation via
ROS production through changes in mitochondrial function
and gene expression were published within the last couple of
years (28, 29), none of those publications probed deep into
the actual biochemical pathway(s) of ROS production in
CaP cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a possible molecular mechanism of androgeninduced activation of an enzymatic pathway that can be
directly related to ROS generation in prostate cells. A clear
understanding of this mechanism may open a new avenue
of research in the field of therapy and/or prevention of
CaP occurrence and progression.

Materials and Methods
Antibodies
Primary antibodies were as follows: monoclonal antibody
against AR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal antibody
against JunD (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal antibody against Gaussia luciferase (Nanolight Technology), and
monoclonal antibody against β-actin (Sigma). Secondary antibodies for immunohistochemistry were as follows: Alexa
Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) and Alexa Fluor
488 donkey anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen).
Cell culture
Androgen-sensitive LNCaP human prostate carcinoma
cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS; F10 medium) as described before (17).
Hep3B human hepatoma cells were obtained from the Small
Molecule Screening Facility at the University of Wisconsin
Carbone Cancer Center and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. Cell lines are tested
annually for Mycoplasma.
Culture conditions for LNCaP androgen response studies
included use of cells passage 40 to 90, hormone-depleted
media containing 4% charcoal-stripped FBS plus 1% non-

stripped FBS (F1C4), and synthetic androgen R1881 (methyltrienolone; NEN) at 1 nmol/L for maximal induction of JunD
and ROS as described before (17, 19, 20). For AR-JunD interaction studies in AR-transfected Hep3B cells, R1881 was used
at 2 nmol/L in DMEM medium to maximally induce AR
(data not shown).
Vector construction
cDNA for human AR was obtained from Open Biosystems.
The whole human junD gene (20) was subcloned in a pCIbased vector (Promega). Two sections of the humanized
Gaussia luciferase gene, NH2-terminal hGluc1 and COOHterminal hGluc2, in two separate vectors (30) were kind gifts
from Prof. Stephen Michnick (University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). hGluc1 was cloned in frame with
the NH2-terminal end of AR in a pcDNA3.1-based vector
(Invitrogen) to create vector Gluc1-AR.
The pCI-junD vector was used to fuse hGluc2 in frame at
the end of the junD gene after removing the junD stop codon
to construct vector JunD-Gluc2. The authenticity of each
construct was verified by using BigDye terminator and
sequencing via the Biotechnology Center of University of
Wisconsin-Madison. The in-frame fusion of each construct
was also verified by transfecting each into AR-negative
Hep3B cells and analyzing cell lysate by Western blot with
AR antibody for Gluc1-AR or antibody for Gaussia luciferase
at the COOH-terminal end of the fusion protein for JunDGluc2. β-Actin was used to control for protein loading in
all Western blot analyses.
Transfection of constructs into Hep3B cells
Hep3B cells (5 × 105) were seeded and then, 1 day later,
cotransfected with 3 μg each of Gluc1-AR and JunD-Gluc2
constructs or transfected with Gluc1-AR or JunD-Gluc2 alone
as negative controls using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent
(Invitrogen) following the manufacturer-supplied protocol.
Two to 3 hours after transfection, cells were washed and refed
DMEM without serum and treated with 2 nmol/L R1881 for 48
hours before collecting cell lysates. Corresponding untreated
cells were used as negative controls.
Bioluminescence activity of Gaussia luciferase in
lysates from Hep3B cells transfected with Gluc1-AR and
JunD-Gluc2
Gaussia luciferase activity was measured in 25 μL of
Hep3B cell lysates from R1881-treated or untreated control
cells using a Gaussia luciferase assay kit from New England
Biolabs following the manufacturer-supplied protocol. Bioluminescence activity of the lysate-substrate mixture was
read on a single-tube Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory) at 480 nm.
Immunocytochemistry
LNCaP cells were grown in F1C4 medium on coverslips
for 2 days followed by 3 days of treatment with 1 nmol/L
R1881. Immunofluorescent staining was carried out following
a published procedure (31) using primary-secondary antibody pairs JunD–Alexa Flour 594 or AR–Alexa Fluor 488.

Immunoprecipitation
For whole-cell lysates, LNCaP cells were lysed using modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing
complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Sciences).
Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared and
checked for purity using NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic
extraction reagents (Thermo Scientific, Pierce Biotechnology)
following manufacturer-supplied protocol. For immunoprecipitation, lysates were precleared by incubation with 50%
protein A–agarose slurry (Pierce). AR antibody (6 μg) and
500 μL precleared lysate (500 μg total protein) were mixed
and rocked overnight at 4°C. The immunocomplex was captured with 100 μL of 50% protein A–agarose slurry and then
analyzed by Western blotting using JunD antibody. The same
immunoprecipitation procedure was repeated for capturing
the immunocomplex using JunD antibody and Western blotting using AR antibody. Proper controls with IgG and protein
A–agarose were run in parallel.
Transcriptional activity of full-length SSAT promoter in
siJunD and vector control cell lines
The full-length SSAT promoter sequence, kindly provided
by Dr. Robert Casero (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore,
MD), was amplified and cloned into pGL4-basic vector (Promega) with a firefly luciferase reporter gene. This vector,
pGL4-SSAT-luc, was transiently transfected into our published (20) JunD-silenced (siJunD) and vector control LNCaP
cell lines. Briefly, 5 × 105 siJunD or vector control LNCaP cells
were seeded and then transfected 1 day later with 1 μg pGL4-

SSAT-luc DNA construct using Lipofectamine 2000. After
transfection, cells were treated with 1 nmol/L R1881 or left
untreated for 72 hours and then lysed. Luciferase activity was
measured in cell lysates by a luciferase assay system kit (Promega) following the manufacturer-supplied protocol.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed using a commercially available ChIP assay kit (Millipore), essentially following the manufacturer-supplied
protocol. Briefly, 2 × 10 6 LNCaP cells were treated with
1 nmol/L R1881 for 24 hours, protein-DNA was cross-linked
by addition of formaldehyde (1% final concentration), cells
were lysed, and lysates were sonicated for twenty 10-second
pulses with 30-second intervals to shear the chromatin into
∼500-bp fragments.
Cross-linked protein-DNA was separated into four parts
and immunoprecipitated with either 6 μg JunD antibody,
6 μg AR antibody, nonspecific rabbit IgG, or no antibody.
Chromatin-antibody complexes were isolated by incubation
with 50% salmon sperm DNA/protein agarose slurry.
Pelleted agarose was eluted and DNA was recovered by
phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. Two microliters of this DNA were used for each
PCR to determine the presence of SSAT promoter fragment
bound to either JunD or AR in the immunoprecipitates.
Primers were designed based on the SSAT gene promoter
sequence to cover the complete SSAT promoter sequence
(GenBank accession number 1103903) as follows: F1,

Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR
Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of SSAT mRNA levels was performed as previously
described (21).

Results
AR and JunD coimmunoprecipitate from LNCaP
cell lysates
The coimmunoprecipitation of AR and JunD was first
shown in whole-cell lysates from LNCaP cells grown under
normal F10 medium conditions (Fig. 1A and B).
The immunoprecipitation of AR by rabbit polyclonal antibody against JunD (IP:JunD) was visualized by Western blot
analysis using monoclonal antibody against human AR
(WB:AR) as shown in Fig. 1A. The immunoprecipitation of
JunD by monoclonal antibody against AR (IP:AR) was visualized by Western blotting using antibody against JunD
(WB:JunD) as shown in Fig. 1B.
To specifically investigate the effect of androgen, LNCaP
cell lysates were prepared after incubation with 1 nmol/L
R1881 for 72 hours and analyzed for coimmunoprecipitation
of AR and JunD. Our published time kinetic studies established that SSAT enzyme activity and cellular ROS production maximize under these treatment conditions (21). The
corresponding results for coimmunoprecipitation of AR
and JunD in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of untreated

versus androgen-treated LNCaP cells are shown in Fig. 1C
and D. Immunoprecipitate using JunD antibody that was
probed in a Western blot using AR antibody (Fig. 1C) showed
that AR-JunD immunocomplex in the nuclear fraction was
increased by ∼3-fold (normalized to β-actin) in 1 nmol/L
R1881–treated cells compared with low androgen-untreated
cells growing in F1C4. Only a small increase was observed in
nuclear fractions by IP:AR and WB:JunD (Fig. 1D). This may
be due to a difference between the nature of interaction
between JunD with its antibody compared with that between
AR and its antibody. No difference in AR-JunD immunocomplex was observed in cytoplasmic fractions of R1881-treated
versus R1881-untreated cells.
Androgen induces nuclear translocation of JunD in
LNCaP cells
To further investigate the effect of androgen treatment on
JunD activity in LNCaP cells, immunofluorescence staining
was performed to determine JunD localization in untreated
versus androgen (1 nmol/L R1881)–treated LNCaP cells. Representative pictures for each condition are shown in Fig. 2. In
untreated LNCaP cells, JunD is mostly dispersed in the cytoplasm with negative staining for the nuclei (Fig. 2A). After
R1881 treatment, a substantial amount of JunD translocates
into the nucleus as shown in Fig. 2B. Using AR antibody and
its related fluorescence-tagged secondary antibody, the
translocation of AR into the nucleus in R1881-treated LNCaP
cells also was observed under the same condition (data not
shown), which is consistent with observation reported elsewhere (31). These data suggest that androgen induces simultaneous translocation of JunD and AR into cell nuclei.
Expression of Gluc1-AR and JunD-Gluc2 in Hep3B cells
Because Hep3B cells do not have endogenous AR, this cell
line was chosen as a model for AR and JunD interaction
studies using a protein complementation assay developed
by Remy and Michnick (30). This technique is based on
reconstitution of the reporter enzyme Gaussia luciferase in
live cells. The gene coding for the enzyme was split into

staining (data not shown). The experiment was repeated twice, including six slides in two replicates per condition with similar results.

cotransfected with Gluc1-AR and JunD-Gluc2 and then treated with androgen (2 nmol/L R1881; gray column) or left untreated (Control; black column).
Cell lysates were collected after 48 h, and bioluminescence activity of Gaussia luciferase was assayed by measuring light emitted from reconstituted
Gluc1-Gluc2 at 480 nm. Reconstitution of Gluc1-Gluc2 and resulting Gaussia luciferase activity was significantly increased >5-fold in androgen-treated cells
compared with untreated control cells. Lysates used for these studies were collected from six independent transfections each run in triplicate. *, P < 10−8.

two sections: NH2-terminal section (Gluc1) and COOH-terminal
section (Gluc2). Gluc1 and Gluc2 sequences were separately
fused to the NH2 terminus of AR (Gluc1-AR) and the COOH
terminus of JunD (JunD-Gluc2), respectively, as shown schematically in Fig. 3A.
To verify in-frame fusion of Gluc1-AR and JunD-Gluc2, cell
lysates from Hep3B cells transfected with Gluc1-AR or JunDGluc2 were analyzed by Western blotting. Figure 3B shows
Western blot analysis using monoclonal antibody against
AR. Hep3B cells alone (Fig. 3B, lane 1) or Hep3B cells transfected with control vector pcDNA3.1 (Fig. 3B, lane 2) do not
show any protein band related to AR. However, expression of
the fusion protein (Gluc1-AR) is observed in cells transfected
with Gluc1-AR (Fig. 3B, lane 3). As AR is fused at the COOHterminal end of Gluc1, the presence of the AR band in the
Western blot confirms the in-frame fusion of AR with Gluc1.
Similarly, the presence of the COOH-terminal portion of
Gaussia luciferase in the Western blot of lysate from Hep3B
cells transfected with JunD-Gluc2 using polyclonal antibody
against Gaussia luciferase confirms the in-frame fusion of
JunD with Gluc2 (Fig. 3C, lane 3). Hep3B cells alone or Hep3B

cells transfected with control vector pCI (Fig. 3C, lanes 1 and
2, respectively) neither expected nor showed any band related to the Gaussia luciferase. β-Actin was used for protein
loading control (Fig. 3B and C). In-frame gene fusions
(Gluc1-AR and JunD-Gluc2) were also confirmed by sequencing using specific primers across the fusion junctions in
both vectors (data not shown).
Bioluminescence activity of reconstituted Gaussia
luciferase in Hep3B cells cotransfected with

Cell lysates from Hep3B cells that were cotransfected with
both Gluc1-AR and JunD-Gluc2 with or without treatment
with androgen (R1881) were collected 48 hours after transfection and analyzed for Gaussia luciferase bioluminescence
activity. Results are shown in Fig. 3D. Lysates from cotransfected cells that were not treated with androgen (control)
showed very low Gaussia luciferase activity. Lysates from
cotransfected cells that were treated with 2 nmol/L R1881
(+R1881) showed significantly higher Gaussia luciferase

activity (>5-fold; P < 10−8) than the untreated cotransfected
cells. Cells transfected with either of the fusion constructs
Gluc1-AR and JunD-Gluc2 individually did not show any
measurable Gaussia luciferase activity (data not shown), confirming that the enzyme activity is only observed after both
fragments Gluc1 and Gluc2 associate with each other (30).
Minor baseline reporter enzyme activity in cell lysates from
androgen-untreated cotransfected cells (control) might be
due to interaction of residual activated AR remaining after
the transfection process, which was performed in medium
containing serum that was not stripped of androgen. These
data clearly establish an interaction of JunD and androgenactivated AR in situ that brings their corresponding fusion
proteins Gluc1 and Gluc2 together to reconstitute Gaussia
luciferase activity.

Activated AR requires JunD to induce transcriptional
activity of the SSAT promoter
The effect of AR activation by androgen on transcriptional
activity of full-length SSAT promoter and the necessity of
JunD for such effect was studied in LNCaP cells stably transfected with either junD-silenced (siJunD) or control vector
that were then transiently transfected with a full-length SSAT
promoter–firefly luciferase reporter vector (FLSSAT-luc) followed by androgen treatment (Fig. 4A and B). Androgen
treatment (1 nmol/L R1881) caused a significant >16-fold
increase in SSAT promoter activity in vector control LNCaP
cells compared with corresponding untreated cells (control)
(Fig. 4A; P = 0.03). Although androgen also caused a small
increase in SSAT promoter activity in siJunD cells, where
JunD expression is 70% suppressed, the extent of induction
was not statistically significant (Fig. 4A; P = 0.16). SSAT
mRNA levels in LNCaP cells determined by qRT-PCR assay
are shown in Fig. 4B. There is an androgen-induced increase in SSAT mRNA (∼10-fold) in siJunD cells, but this
increase is much less than that observed in vector control
cells (∼25-fold). Thus, although some increase in SSAT
mRNA expression in siJunD cells was observed, the increase
is not enough to significantly enhance cellular SSAT protein
expression as evident from the insignificant increase in
luciferase reporter expression.
JunD binds to the SSAT promoter in situ by ChIP assay
ChIP assay was performed in LNCaP cells with R1881
treatment to ascertain if activated AR and/or JunD bind to
the SSAT promoter site using primer sets targeted to identify
the SSAT promoter sequence in the immunoprecipitates (see
Materials and Methods). ChIP assay was performed under
conditions where only protein-DNA and not protein-protein
interactions can be detected (reviewed in ref. 32). Under
these conditions, the only PCR product obtained using those
primers was from chromatin fragment(s) immunoprecipitated by rabbit polyclonal antibody against JunD using the
F1R1 primer pair as shown in Fig. 5A. Using the same F1R1
primer pair, no PCR product was obtained from immunoprecipitates obtained by monoclonal antibody against AR, nor
from the nonspecific IgG and no antibody controls. None
of the other primer pairs yielded any PCR product from
either JunD-, AR-, or IgG-immunoprecipitated chromatin
fragments (data not shown).
The sequence data obtained from the PCR product that
was cloned in pCR2.1 TOPO indicate the existence of JunDbinding sites at −574 to −651 bp upstream in the SSAT promoter sequence that contains multiple half-sites (TGA) of the
AP-1 consensus sequence (TGAG/CTCA; Fig. 5B).

Discussion
Although it is well established that androgens produce
oxidative stress in prostate cells that plays a key role in the
occurrence and progression of CaP, the exact molecular
mechanism of androgen-induced oxidative stress generation
in prostatic epithelia and CaP cells is only recently being
elucidated. We previously reported that AP-1 transcription

cells treated with androgen (1 nmol/L R1881) using primer pairs targeted to identify the SSAT promoter sequence (see text). A, agarose gel electrophoresis

factor JunD plays a key role in androgen induction of ROS
(20). Recently, we reported that androgen significantly
induces the expression and enzymatic activity of SSAT (21),
a regulatory enzyme in the polyamine catabolic pathway that
produces excess amount of ROS in polyamine-rich prostate
cells. In this report, we show a relationship at the molecular
level between these two components that establishes the
mechanism of androgen-induced ROS generation in prostate
cells.
Discovering the mechanism that regulates expression of
SSAT is the focus of many studies (33–35). Thus far, binding
sites of many important transcription factors in the SSAT
gene promoter have been identified (33–35). Because the
SSAT gene promoter sequence lacks an ARE, the mechanism
of androgen-induced SSAT expression is unclear. Here, we

show a direct binding of androgen-activated AR with JunD,
and that an induction of SSAT by androgen occurs following
an interaction of JunD with a specific sequence in the SSAT
promoter only in androgen-treated LNCaP cells, probably
due to the formation of an activated AR-JunD complex.
We previously showed that androgen-activated AR induces
overexpression of transcription factor JunD as well as activates
JunD binding to the AP-1 DNA-binding sequence in LNCaP
cells (19). Here, we show that androgen treatment causes AR
and JunD to coprecipitate as an immunocomplex from LNCaP
cell lysate. Relatively more complex precipitates from the
nuclear than from the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 1). Androgen
treatment induces translocation of JunD into the nucleus
in LNCaP cells (Fig. 2) at the same time as AR translocates
into the nucleus as shown by immunoprecipitation/Western

blot of nuclear extract (Fig. 1C) and also reported by other laboratories (31). These observations suggest an interaction of
activated AR with JunD in androgen-treated CaP cells that also
causes functional activation of JunD.
More direct evidence of AR and JunD interaction was
shown using the Gaussia luciferase reconstitution assay
recently developed to study in situ protein-protein interactions (30). The significant reconstitution of Gaussia luciferase
activity only in androgen-treated Hep3B cells transfected
with vectors expressing NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal
fragments of Gaussia luciferase enzyme linked to AR and
JunD, respectively, provides clear and direct evidence of JunD
interaction with androgen-activated AR in situ (Fig. 3D).
Although immunoprecipitation and colocalization of AR with
another AP-1 family member, c-Jun, have been reported
(31), to the best of our knowledge, this is the first direct
demonstration of androgen-activated AR and JunD complex
formation.
Because overexpression of JunD is necessary for the induction of ROS following androgen exposure (19, 20), presumably the AR-JunD complex regulates expression of genes
involved in ROS production in LNCaP cells. The complex
may bind via JunD to sequences containing binding sites
for members of the AP-1 family of transcription factors
(TGAG/C TCA; ref. 36). These sequences may or may not
contain any ARE sequence. Thus, many genes such as SSAT
that are not directly regulated by AR might be regulated by
an AR-JunD complex.
By scanning the SSAT gene promoter sequence in silico, we
identified six putative AP-1–binding sites. Using our siJunD
clone of the LNCaP cell line (20), we showed that in the
absence of JunD, androgen-activated AR does not induce
SSAT expression (Fig. 4). Thus, we conclude that androgenactivated AR requires JunD for SSAT expression.
A direct binding of JunD to the SSAT promoter sequence
was shown by ChIP assay (Fig. 5). By PCR analysis with
primers designed to identify the SSAT promoter, we obtained

a PCR product that corresponds to a DNA fragment of the
SSAT promoter only in the chromatin fragment precipitated
by JunD antibody and not in the chromatin fragment precipitated by AR antibody (Fig. 5A). This suggests that under
these conditions, where JunD directly binds to the −574 to
−651 bp of the SSAT promoter, there may not be a direct
binding of AR to the SSAT promoter. Elucidation of this
mechanism also explains the delay in SSAT expression
(72 h) and ROS generation after androgen treatment as
previously reported (21).
Collectively, our data suggest that activated AR forms a
complex with JunD that binds to an AP-1 DNA-binding
sequence in the SSAT promoter to activate SSAT gene transcription, resulting in overproduction of H2O2 in CaP cells,
as shown schematically in Fig. 6. To the best of our knowledge, the data presented above provide for the first time a
molecular mechanism of androgen-induced increase in
SSAT activity and consequent ROS overproduction in CaP
cells. The demonstration of a mechanistic pathway of
androgen-induced ROS production opens up a new avenue
for development of drugs that specifically target steps in
this ROS-generating pathway in CaP cells and thus can be
effective in therapy and prevention of CaP without major
systemic toxicity.
